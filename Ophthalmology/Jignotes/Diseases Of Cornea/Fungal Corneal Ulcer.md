# [[Diseases Of Cornea]] > Fungal Corneal Ulcer

### Fungal Corneal Ulcer (Mycotic Keratitis)

**Mycotic Keratitis** is a suppurative corneal infection caused by fungi. The incidence has increased recently due to the injudicious use of antibiotics and steroids. It is particularly common in tropical climates and agricultural areas.

#### Etiology and Classification of Fungi
Fungi affecting the [[Cornea]] are broadly classified into:

| Type | Organisms | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Filamentous Fungi** | **[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]** (Most common)<br>**[[Fusarium]]** solani | Septate hyphae. Common in agricultural/vegetative trauma. |
| **Yeasts** | **[[Candida albicans]]** | Unicellular, reproduce by budding. Common in immunocompromised hosts. |
| **Dimorphic Fungi** | Histoplasma, Blastomyces | Demonstrate both yeast and mycelial phases (Rare). |

*   **Most Common Cause:** [[Aspergillus]] (worldwide and India).
*   **Most Common in Contact Lens Wearers/Immunocompromised:** [[Candida albicans]].

#### Risk Factors and Mode of Infection
Fungal infections are usually exogenous. Key predisposing factors include:
*   **Trauma with Vegetative Matter:** Injury with tree branches, straw, leaves, or thorns (paddy/sugarcane injury). This is the most specific risk factor for filamentous fungi.
*   **Injury by Animal Tail:** A known mode of infection.
*   **Chronic Topical Steroid/Antibiotic Use:** Disturbs the symbiosis between bacteria and fungi, making the eye prone to opportunistic fungal infection.
*   **Systemic Factors:** Diabetes, immunosuppression, or chronic dry eye (predisposes to Candida).

#### Clinical Features
A hallmark feature of fungal keratitis is that **Signs are more prominent than Symptoms** (patient is less symptomatic relative to the severity of the ulcer).

**Symptoms:**
*   Foreign body sensation.
*   Mild pain (less than bacterial or Acanthamoeba).
*   Watering and redness.
*   Photophobia.
*   Blurring of vision.

**Signs:**
*   **Ulcer Appearance:** Dry-looking, grayish-white ulcer with a rough surface and elevated, rolled-out margins.
*   **Margins:** **Feathery margins** or finger-like extensions into the stroma (due to hyphal infiltration).
*   **[[Satellite Lesions]]:** Small, discrete infiltrates surrounding the main ulcer.
*   **[[Immune Ring of Wessely]]:** A sterile yellow line of demarcation/ring infiltrate formed by the antigen-antibody reaction (viral/fungal antigens meeting host antibodies).
*   **Endothelial Plaque:** Fibrin and leukocytes composed plaque on the endothelium underlying the ulcer.
*   **[[Hypopyon]]:**
    *   Thick and immobile (unlike bacterial which is often fluid/mobile).
    *   **Non-sterile:** Fungi can penetrate the intact [[Descemet's Membrane]] into the anterior chamber without perforation.
    *   May have a convex upper border.
*   **Vascularization:** Conspicuously absent in pure mycotic ulcers.

#### Diagnosis and Investigations
Clinical diagnosis is confirmed by laboratory tests. Scrapings should be taken from the **base and leading edge** of the ulcer.

| Investigation Method | Findings/Utility |
| :--- | :--- |
| **10% KOH Mount** | Wet preparation dissolves debris; reveals hyphae or yeast cells. |
| **Gram/Giemsa Stain** | Differentiates from bacteria; shows hyphae and inflammatory cells. |
| **Calcofluor White** | Fluorescent brightener; stains fungal cell walls bright apple-green. |
| **Culture Media** | **[[Sabouraud's Dextrose Agar]] (SDA)**: Standard for fungi.<br>**Blood Agar**: For aerobic organisms/fungi.<br>**Brain-Heart Infusion**: For fastidious fungi. |
| **Gomori Methenamine Silver (GMS)** | Excellent stain for histological identification. |
| **PCR** | Rapid results for fungal DNA. |
| **Confocal Microscopy** | Non-invasive; allows direct visualization of hyphae in vivo. |

#### Management
Treatment is often prolonged (6–8 weeks) due to poor penetration of antifungals.

**1. General Measures:**
*   **Cycloplegics:** [[Atropine]] 1% to relieve ciliary spasm and prevent posterior synechiae.
*   **Analgesics & Vitamins:** For support.
*   **Contraindication:** **STOP Topical Steroids** immediately. They enhance fungal replication and corneal invasion.

**2. Specific Antifungal Therapy:**
*   **For Filamentous Fungi (Aspergillus/Fusarium):**
    *   **Drug of Choice:** **[[Natamycin]] (Pimaricin) 5%** suspension. Instilled hourly initially, then tapered.
    *   Alternative: [[Amphotericin B]] (0.15% - 0.3%) drops.
*   **For Yeasts (Candida):**
    *   **Drug of Choice:** **[[Amphotericin B]]** 0.15% or [[Nystatin]] 3.5% ointment.
    *   Alternative: [[Fluconazole]] 0.2% drops.
*   **Broad Spectrum/Newer Agents:**
    *   **[[Voriconazole]] (1%):** Excellent penetration; effective against both filamentous and yeast forms. Can be given topically, orally, or intrastromally.

**3. Systemic Antifungals:**
*   Indicated in severe cases, deep ulcers, or impending perforation.
*   **Ketoconazole** (200 mg BD) or **Fluconazole** or **Itraconazole**.

**4. Surgical Management:**
*   **Mechanical Debridement:** Scraping the epithelium aids drug penetration (especially since Natamycin has poor penetration) and removes necrotic load.
*   **Therapeutic Penetrating Keratoplasty ([[Keratoplasty]]):** Indicated for non-responsive cases or perforated ulcers. Performed after maximal medical therapy.

#### Clinical Implications
*   **Misdiagnosis:** Often mistaken for bacterial ulcers. If an ulcer worsens on antibiotics/steroids, suspect fungus.
*   **Hypopyon Significance:** In bacterial ulcers, hypopyon is usually sterile (toxic reaction). In fungal ulcers, the hypopyon may contain actual fungal elements because fungi can penetrate intact Descemet's membrane.
*   **Natamycin Penetration:** Natamycin penetrates poorly; frequent debridement is essential to enhance absorption.
