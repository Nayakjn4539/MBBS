# [[Nose Surgery]] > Submucous Resection

### Submucous Resection (SMR) of Nasal Septum

**Submucous Resection** ([[SMR]]) is a surgical procedure aimed at correcting a [[Deviated Nasal Septum]] ([[DNS]]) by extensively resecting the deviated cartilaginous and bony parts of the septum while preserving the mucoperichondrial and mucoperiosteal flaps,.

Although largely replaced by [[Septoplasty]] in modern practice due to its radical nature and complications, understanding [[SMR]] is crucial for historical context, graft harvesting, and specific anatomical corrections,.

### Indications and Contraindications

#### Indications
*   **Nasal Obstruction:** Persistent obstruction caused by [[Deviated Nasal Septum]] causing mechanical blockage,.
*   **Recurrent Epistaxis:** Bleeding from a septal spur,.
*   **Headache:** Septal deviation making contact with the lateral nasal wall (contact point headache).
*   **Surgical Access:**
    *   Approach for [[Hypophysectomy]] (trans-septal trans-sphenoidal approach),.
    *   [[Vidian Neurectomy]].
*   **Graft Harvesting:** To obtain septal cartilage or bone for tympanoplasty or rhinoplasty,.

#### Contraindications
*   **Age < 17 years:** **Absolute contraindication**. The resection involves centers of ossification which fuse by 17 years; surgery before this interferes with the growth of the nasal skeleton,,.
*   **Acute Infection:** Acute respiratory tract infections or sinus infections.
*   **Bleeding Disorders:** Untreated coagulopathies.
*   **Untreated Systemic Disease:** Uncontrolled diabetes or hypertension.

### Preoperative Preparation

*   **Anesthesia:**
    *   **Local Anesthesia (Preferred):** Surface anesthesia with 4% Xylocaine nasal packing + Infiltration with 2% Xylocaine and 1:100,000 Adrenaline (to reduce bleeding),.
    *   **General Anesthesia:** Used in children (rarely for SMR) or apprehensive adults.
*   **Position:** Reclining position with the head end of the table raised.

### Surgical Steps

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a sagittal view of the nasal septum showing the Killian's incision line and the area of cartilage/bone resection, highlighting the preserved L-shaped strut

1.  **Incision (Killian's Incision):**
    *   A curvilinear incision is made at the mucocutaneous junction on one side (usually the left).
    *   Location: About **5 mm to 1 cm cephalic/posterior** to the caudal end of the septal cartilage,.
    *   *Note:* This differs from [[Septoplasty]], which uses [[Freer's Incision]] (hemitransfixion) at the caudal border.

2.  **Elevation of First Flap:**
    *   The mucoperichondrial and mucoperiosteal flap is elevated on the side of the incision using a [[Freer's elevator]].
    *   Dissection must be in the subperichondrial plane (between cartilage and perichondrium) to avoid bleeding and tearing.

3.  **Incision of Cartilage:**
    *   The septal cartilage is incised carefully to reach the opposite side without perforating the opposite mucoperichondrium,.

4.  **Elevation of Opposite Flap:**
    *   An elevator is passed through the cartilage incision, and the flap is raised on the opposite side.
    *   **Result:** The septal framework is now stripped of mucosal flaps on both sides.

5.  **Resection of Deviation:**
    *   **Cartilage:** Removed using a [[Ballenger swivel knife]],.
    *   **Bone:** Posterior bony septum and maxillary crest removed using [[Luc's forceps]] or a [[Gouge]] and [[Mallet]],.

6.  **Preservation of L-Strut (Crucial Step):**
    *   A strip of cartilage approximately **1 cm wide** must be preserved along the **dorsal border** and **caudal border** of the septum,.
    *   *Clinical Implication:* Failure to preserve the dorsal strut leads to [[Saddle Nose Deformity]]. Failure to preserve the caudal strut leads to [[Columellar Retraction]],.

7.  **Closure and Packing:**
    *   The flaps are repositioned.
    *   Incisions may be sutured (catgut/silk).
    *   Bilateral anterior nasal packing (ribbon gauze with antibiotic/paraffin) is done to prevent [[Septal Hematoma]],.

### Postoperative Care

*   **Position:** Semi-sitting position to minimize oozing.
*   **Diet:** Soft diet for 2 days to minimize active mastication which may cause bleeding.
*   **Pack Removal:** Usually after 24 hours.
*   **Medication:** Systemic antibiotics and analgesics. Nasal douching after pack removal.

### Complications

| Type | Complication | Cause/Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Immediate** | **Hemorrhage** | Primary (during surgery) or Reactionary (post-op). |
| | **Septal Tear** | Instrumental trauma during flap elevation. |
| **Early** | **[[Septal Hematoma]]** | Collection of blood between flaps. Needs aspiration/drainage. |
| | **[[Septal Abscess]]** | Infection of hematoma. Can lead to cartilage necrosis. |
| **Late** | **[[Septal Perforation]]** | Tears in opposing mucosal flaps at the same level. |
| | **[[Saddle Nose Deformity]]** | Excessive removal of the dorsal cartilaginous strut,. |
| | **[[Columellar Retraction]]** | Removal of the caudal cartilaginous strut. |
| | **Flapping Septum** | Excessive removal of septal framework leaving only mucosal flaps. |
| | **Toxic Shock Syndrome** | Rare; following staphylococcal infection due to packing. |

**Mnemonic for Complications:** **HAPS**
*   **H**ematoma
*   **A**bscess
*   **P**erforation
*   **S**addle nose

### Comparison: SMR vs. Septoplasty

| Feature | Submucous Resection (SMR) | Septoplasty |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nature** | Radical/Resective operation | Conservative/Reconstructive operation |
| **Incision** | **Killian's Incision** (cephalic to caudal border) | **Freer's/Hemitransfixion** (at caudal border) |
| **Flap Elevation** | Bilateral (both sides) | Unilateral (one side mainly) |
| **Extent of Removal** | Extensive removal of cartilage/bone | Minimal removal; only deviated part resected |
| **Age Limit** | **Adults only (>17 years)** | Can be done in children |
| **Revision Surgery** | Difficult (no cartilage left) | Easier |
| **Complications** | Higher (Saddle nose, perforation) | Lower incidence |
| **Combination** | Difficult to combine with [[Rhinoplasty]] | Can be combined (Septorhinoplasty) |
