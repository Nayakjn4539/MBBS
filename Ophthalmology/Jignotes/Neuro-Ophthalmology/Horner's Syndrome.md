# [[Neuro-Ophthalmology]] > Horner's Syndrome

### **Horner's Syndrome (Oculosympathetic Palsy)**

[[Horner's Syndrome]] is a clinical triad of signs resulting from the interruption of the sympathetic nerve supply to the eye (oculosympathetic paresis).

---

### **Sympathetic Pathway Anatomy**
Understanding the pathway is essential for localizing the lesion. It consists of a three-neuron chain:

**1. First-Order Neuron (Central)**
*   **Origin:** Posterior [[Hypothalamus]].
*   **Course:** Descends uncrossed through the brainstem (midbrain, pons, medulla) to the spinal cord.
*   **Termination:** [[Ciliospinal Center of Budge]] located in the intermediolateral gray column of the spinal cord at levels **C8 to T2**.

**2. Second-Order Neuron (Preganglionic)**
*   **Origin:** Ciliospinal Center of Budge (C8-T2).
*   **Course:** Fibers exit the spinal cord via ventral roots, enter the thoracic sympathetic chain, and ascend through the neck. They are closely related to the apical pleura of the lung (Pancoast tumor risk).
*   **Termination:** [[Superior Cervical Ganglion]] (located at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery/angle of the jaw).

**3. Third-Order Neuron (Postganglionic)**
*   **Origin:** Superior Cervical Ganglion.
*   **Course:** Fibers ascend along the **Internal Carotid Artery (ICA)** plexus into the cavernous sinus.
    *   *Sweat gland fibers:* Branch off earlier along the external carotid artery to supply the face (Important for localizing anhydrosis).
    *   *Pupil fibers:* In the cavernous sinus, they join the **Ophthalmic division (V1)** of the [[Trigeminal Nerve]], travel via the [[Nasociliary Nerve]], and enter the globe as [[Long Ciliary Nerves]].
*   **Termination:** [[Dilator Pupillae]] muscle (for mydriasis) and [[Muller's Muscle]] (superior tarsal muscle).

### **Etiology**
The causes are classified based on the location of the lesion along the three-neuron pathway:

| Neuron Order | Location | Common Causes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **First Order** | Central (Brainstem/Cord) | • Brainstem lesions (Stroke, Tumors)<br>• [[Wallenberg Syndrome]] (Lateral medullary syndrome)<br>• [[Syringomyelia]]<br>• Multiple Sclerosis |
| **Second Order** | Preganglionic (Chest/Neck) | • **[[Pancoast Tumor]]** (Lung apex malignancy)<br>• Trauma/Surgery to the neck<br>• Aortic Aneurysm<br>• Cervical rib |
| **Third Order** | Postganglionic (Skull base/Orbit) | • **[[Internal Carotid Artery Dissection]]** (Painful Horner's)<br>• Cavernous sinus thrombosis/mass<br>• Cluster headaches<br>• Otitis media |

---

### **Clinical Features**
The clinical presentation is strictly **unilateral** (ipsilateral to the lesion).

**Classic Triad (and extended features):**
1.  **[[Miosis]] (Constricted Pupil):**
    *   Due to paralysis of the [[Dilator Pupillae]]. The sphincter pupillae (parasympathetic) works unopposed.
    *   **Anisocoria:** The pupil inequality is more marked in **dim illumination** because the affected pupil fails to dilate (Dilation Lag).
2.  **[[Ptosis]]:**
    *   Mild (1–2 mm) drooping of the upper eyelid due to paralysis of **Muller’s muscle** (smooth muscle innervated by sympathetics), *not* the Levator Palpebrae Superioris (CN III).
    *   **Inverse Ptosis:** Slight elevation of the lower lid due to paralysis of the inferior tarsal muscle.
3.  **[[Anhydrosis]] (Loss of sweating):**
    *   Depending on the lesion level.
    *   *Central/Preganglionic:* Affects the entire half of the face/head.
    *   *Postganglionic:* Usually absent or limited to the forehead because fibers to the face travel with the External Carotid Artery.
4.  **[[Enophthalmos]] (Apparent):**
    *   The eye appears sunken due to the narrowing of the palpebral fissure (ptosis + lower lid elevation), but true enophthalmos is often absent in humans.
5.  **Loss of Ciliospinal Reflex:**
    *   Painful stimulation of the neck/trunk fails to dilate the pupil.
6.  **[[Heterochromia Iridis]] (Hypochromia):**
    *   Seen in **Congenital** Horner’s syndrome. The iris on the affected side is lighter (hypochromic) because sympathetic innervation is required for melanin development in stromal melanocytes.

**Mnemonic:** **HIMAPLE**
*   **H**eterochromia Iridis
*   **I**nferior eyelid elevation (Inverse Ptosis)
*   **M**iosis
*   **A**nhydrosis
*   **P**tosis
*   **L**oss of ciliospinal reflex
*   **E**nophthalmos (Apparent)

**Clinical Implication:**
A painful Horner’s syndrome (acute onset of pain in the neck/face with ptosis and miosis) is a medical emergency suggestive of **[[Carotid Artery Dissection]]**.

### **Diagnosis (Pharmacological Testing)**

Diagnosis involves two steps: Confirming the syndrome and Localizing the lesion.

#### **1. Confirmation Tests**
Used to differentiate Horner's syndrome from physiological anisocoria.

| Drug | Mechanism | Normal Eye Response | Horner's Eye Response | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Cocaine]] (4% or 10%)** | Blocks reuptake of Norepinephrine (NE) at the synaptic cleft. | **Dilation** (NE accumulates) | **No Dilation** (No NE released to reuptake) | Diagnosis Confirmed if anisocoria increases. |
| **[[Apraclonidine]] (0.5% or 1%)** | Weak $\alpha_1$ agonist (usually constricts conjunctival vessels). | **No effect** (or mild constriction) | **Dilation** | **Reversal of Anisocoria.** Due to denervation hypersensitivity (upregulation of receptors) in Horner's. |

#### **2. Localization Tests**
Used to distinguish between Preganglionic (1st/2nd order) and Postganglionic (3rd order) lesions.

| Drug | Mechanism | Preganglionic Lesion (1st/2nd) | Postganglionic Lesion (3rd) | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Hydroxyamphetamine]] (1%)** | Stimulates release of stored NE from nerve endings. | **Dilation** | **No Dilation** | If the 3rd order neuron is dead, there are no stores of NE to release. If the lesion is pre-ganglionic, the 3rd order neuron is intact and dilates. |
| **[[Phenylephrine]] (1%)** | Direct $\alpha$ agonist. | Minimal dilation | **Marked Dilation** | Due to denervation hypersensitivity in postganglionic lesions (Similar concept to Apraclonidine). |
