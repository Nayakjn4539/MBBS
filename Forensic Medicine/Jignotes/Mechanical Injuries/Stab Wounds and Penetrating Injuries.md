# [[Mechanical Injuries]] > Stab Wounds and Penetrating Injuries

### Stab Wounds and Penetrating Injuries

**Stab wounds** (also known as **Puncture wounds**) are mechanical injuries caused by driving a sharp-pointed object into the body. The fundamental characteristic distinguishing them from other wounds is that their **depth is greater than their length and width** on the skin surface.

These injuries are produced by pointed weapons such as knives, daggers, scissors, screwdrivers, ice picks, needles, spears, or arrows.

### **Classification**

Stab wounds fall under the broader category of sharp force trauma but can be sub-classified based on the extent of penetration:

1.  **Puncture Wounds:** The weapon penetrates the soft tissues but does not enter a body cavity.
2.  **Penetrating Wounds:** The weapon pierces the body wall and enters a cavity (e.g., pleural, peritoneal, pericardial, or joint cavities).
3.  **Perforating Wounds (Through-and-Through):** The weapon enters the body on one side and exits from another, creating both an **entry wound** and an **exit wound**. The entry wound is typically larger with inverted edges, while the exit wound is smaller with everted edges (due to the tapering of the blade).

### **General Characteristics of Stab Wounds**

1.  **Dimensions:**
    *   **Depth:** It is the greatest dimension. It represents the length of the blade inserted into the body. **Important:** The depth of the wound can be *greater* than the length of the blade if the body wall is compressed (pushed in) during the thrust (e.g., abdominal wall). Conversely, it can be *shallower* if the blade is not fully inserted.
    *   **Length:** Corresponds to the **width** of the blade.
    *   **Width:** Corresponds to the **thickness** of the blade.

2.  **Margins (Edges):**
    *   Usually **clean-cut** and well-defined.
    *   Typically **inverted**. However, they may appear everted in fatty areas (e.g., buttocks, protuberant abdomen) due to subcutaneous fat extrusion.
    *   Usually **no abrasion or bruising** is seen on the margins unless the weapon is blunt or the **hilt (guard)** of the weapon strikes the skin.

3.  **Angles:**
    *   Dependent on the type of weapon (single-edged vs double-edged).

4.  **Direction:**
    *   Indicates the relative position of the assailant and the victim.

### **Morphology Based on Weapon Used**

The shape of the cutaneous entry wound provides clues about the weapon:

| Type of Weapon | Wound Appearance |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Single-edged Knife** | **Triangular or Wedge-shaped** or Tear-drop. <br> One angle is sharp (cutting edge), and the other is blunt/squared-off (back of the blade). <br> **[[Fish-tailing]]**: May be seen at the blunt end due to skin splitting. |
| **Double-edged Knife** | **Elliptical or Spindle-shaped** (Slit-like). <br> Both angles are sharp/pointed. |
| **Round Object** (Ice pick, Poker) | **Circular** or elliptical. <br> May resemble a bullet wound but lacks abrasion collar/fouling. |
| **Square Object** | **Cruciate / Cross-shaped** (star-shaped). |
| **Scissors** | Can produce linear or **diamond-shaped** wounds depending on whether blades are closed or open. |
| **Screw Driver** | **Slit-like** with square ends and abraded margins. |
| **Broken Glass** | Irregular shape, bruised margins, may contain glass fragments. |

### **Factors Affecting Wound Appearance**

1.  **Langer's Lines (Cleavage Lines of Skin):**
    *   If the stab is **parallel** to Langer's lines $\rightarrow$ The wound appears **slit-like/linear** and margins stay together.
    *   If the stab is **perpendicular/transverse** to Langer's lines $\rightarrow$ The wound **gapes** and appears oval/elliptical.
2.  **Movement (Rocking/Twisting):**
    *   If the knife is twisted during withdrawal or if the victim moves, the wound becomes **cruciate** or irregular. The wound length becomes larger than the blade width.
3.  **Hilt Marks:**
    *   If the weapon is driven in with full force up to the handle, the **guard (hilt)** may cause **patterned bruising/abrasion** around the entry wound. This indicates significant force.

### **Medicolegal Importance**

1.  **Nature of the Weapon:** The shape and dimensions of the wound help identify the class of weapon (e.g., single-edged vs. double-edged).
2.  **Force Used:**
    *   Generally, minimal force is required to penetrate skin with a sharp knife.
    *   Force increases if: The knife is blunt, clothing is thick, or **bone/cartilage** is penetrated.
    *   The presence of hilt marks suggests excessive force.
3.  **Direction of Attack:** Helps reconstruct the crime scene and relative positions of assailant and victim.
4.  **Manner of Death:**
    *   **Homicidal:** Most common. Often multiple, directed at vital organs (chest, abdomen, neck). **[[Defense wounds]]** may be present on the victim's hands/forearms.
    *   **Suicidal:** Accessible sites (precordium, epigastrium, wrist, neck). Often accompanied by **hesitation cuts** (tentative superficial wounds). The clothing is usually removed from the site.
        *   **[[Harakiri]]** (Seppuku): A ritualistic suicide involving disembowelment using a short sword.
    *   **Accidental:** Rare; usually involves falls onto sharp objects or industrial accidents.
5.  **Age of Injury:** Can be estimated from healing stages (fresh, scabbed, scar).

### **Complications & Cause of Death**

*   **Hemorrhage:** Most common cause of death (external or internal).
*   **Cardiac Tamponade:** In penetrating chest wounds involving the pericardium.
*   **Air Embolism:** Especially in neck stabs injuring jugular veins.
*   **Asphyxia:** Due to inhalation of blood in airway injuries.
*   **Pneumothorax/Hemothorax:** Lung penetration.
*   **Infection:** Sepsis from contaminated weapons or bowel perforation (Peritonitis).

### **Concealed Puncture Wounds**

These are stab wounds in hidden body parts often used for infanticide or stealthy murders. A careful autopsy search is required in:
*   Fontanelles (infants)
*   Nostrils
*   Inner canthus of the eye
*   Nape of the neck (Pithing)
*   Axilla
*   Vagina / Rectum

### **Therapeutic Wounds vs. Criminal Wounds**

Medical interventions can mimic stab wounds.
*   **Surgical incisions:** Clean cut, therapeutic location (e.g., drain sites, tracheostomy).
*   **Differentiation:** Review hospital records; do not remove tubes/drains before autopsy to verify their therapeutic nature.
