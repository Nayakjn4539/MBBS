# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Yellow fever vaccine

### **Yellow Fever Vaccine (17D Vaccine)**

**[[Yellow Fever]]** is a zoonotic viral hemorrhagic disease. Vaccination is the most effective control strategy for prevention and is crucial for international travel regulations.

### **1. Vaccine Characteristics**
*   **Type:** [[Live attenuated vaccine]].
*   **Strain:** **17D Strain** (Non-virulent strain grown in chick embryo).
*   **Form:** Freeze-dried (Lyophilized) product.
*   **Sensitivity:** It is highly **heat sensitive** and light sensitive,.

### **2. Administration and Dosage**

| Parameter | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Dose** | 0.5 ml, |
| **Route** | [[Subcutaneous]], |
| **Site** | Insertion of [[Deltoid muscle]], |
| **Age** | > 9 months of age (irrespective of age in adults), |
| **Diluent** | **Cold Physiological Saline**, |

**Clinical Relevance (Handling):**
*   The vaccine must be stored between +5°C and -30°C (preferably below zero) until use.
*   **Reconstitution Rule:** Once reconstituted with cold saline, it must be kept on ice, away from sunlight, and used within **half an hour** (30 minutes). If not used, it must be discarded.

### **3. Immunity and Validity**
*   **Onset of Immunity:** Begins on the **7th day** after vaccination.
*   **Duration of Immunity:** Effectively **Life-long**,.
*   **International Certificate of Vaccination:**

### **4. Contraindications**
The vaccine is generally safe, but contraindicated in specific groups:
1.  **Infants:** < 9 months (Risk of vaccine-associated encephalitis).
2.  **Pregnancy:** Generally contraindicated. Only given during outbreaks if the risk of infection outweighs the risk to the fetus.
3.  **Allergy:** Persons with severe allergy to **Egg protein** (Prepared in chick embryo),.
4.  **Immunodeficiency:** Symptomatic [[HIV/AIDS]], thymus disorders, or immunosuppressive therapy.

### **5. Adverse Events (AEFI)**
*   **Common:** Mild headache, myalgia, low-grade fever (2–5% of vaccinees) occurring 5–10 days after vaccination.
*   **Rare/Serious:**
    *   Anaphylaxis (mainly in egg-allergic individuals).
    *   Vaccine-associated neurotropic disease.
    *   Vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease.

### **6. Drug Interaction**
*   **Cholera Vaccine:** Yellow fever and Cholera vaccines should **not** be given together. They interfere with each other's antibody response.
*   **Rule:** A gap of at least **3 weeks** should be maintained between the two,.

### **7. India and Yellow Fever (Public Health Importance)**
India is classified as a **[[Yellow Fever Receptive Area]]**.
*   **Conditions present for transmission:**
    *   Abundance of vector ([[Aedes aegypti]]).
    *   Susceptible human and monkey (Macacus) population.
    *   Favorable climatic conditions.
*   **Missing Factor:** The **Virus** is absent in India.
*   **Quarantine Measures:**
    *   Travelers arriving from endemic zones without a valid certificate are placed in **[[Quarantine]]**.
    *   **Duration:** **6 Days** (The maximum incubation period of Yellow Fever),.
    *   **Disinfection:** Aircraft and ships from endemic areas undergo aerosol spraying to destroy vectors.
