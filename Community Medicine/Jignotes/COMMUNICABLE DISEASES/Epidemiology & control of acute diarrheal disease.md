# Epidemiology and Control of Acute Diarrheal Disease

### Definition
[[Diarrhea]] is defined as the passage of loose, liquid, or watery stools, usually **more than three times a day**. However, the recent change in **consistency and character** of stools is more important than the mere number of stools.

### Clinical Types
It is practical to base treatment on the clinical type of illness:
1.  **Acute Watery Diarrhea:** Lasts hours to days. Main danger is **dehydration**. Common pathogens: [[Vibrio cholerae]], [[E. coli]], [[Rotavirus]].
2.  **Acute Bloody Diarrhea ([[Dysentery]]):** Visible blood in stools. Main dangers: Mucosal damage, sepsis, malnutrition. Common pathogen: *Shigella*.
3.  **Persistent Diarrhea:** Lasts **14 days or longer**. Main danger: Malnutrition and non-intestinal infection.
4.  **Diarrhea with Severe Malnutrition:** Associated with Marasmus/Kwashiorkor. Dangers: Severe systemic infection, heart failure, vitamin deficiency.

### Epidemiological Determinants

#### 1. Agent Factors
In developing countries, the cause is almost universally infectious.

| Agent Type | Common Organisms | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Viruses** | [[Rotavirus]] | Leading cause of severe dehydrating diarrhea in children <5 years. |
| | Astrovirus, Adenovirus | |
| **Bacteria** | [[Enterotoxigenic E. coli]] (ETEC) | Major cause of **Traveler's diarrhea**. |
| | [[Vibrio cholerae]] | Causes explosive epidemics. |
| | *Shigella*, *Salmonella*, *Campylobacter* | |
| **Protozoa** | *E. histolytica*, *Giardia*, *Cryptosporidium* | *Giardia* flourishes in duodenum/jejunum. |
| **Non-infectious** | Malnutrition, Parenteral infections | e.g., Otitis media, Measles. |

#### 2. Host Factors
*   **Age:** Most common in children between **6 months and 2 years**. Highest incidence at 6–11 months (weaning period) due to declining maternal antibodies and introduction of contaminated food.
*   **Malnutrition:** Malnutrition leads to infection, and infection leads to diarrhea—a **vicious circle**.
*   **Immunity:** Lack of exclusive breastfeeding increases risk.

#### 3. Environmental Factors
*   **Season:** **Rotavirus** peaks in winter; **Bacterial diarrheas** peak in warmer/rainy seasons.
*   **Transmission:** Primarily by the [[Fecal-Oral Route]].

**Mnemonic for Transmission (The 5 F's):**
*   **F**luids (Water)
*   **F**ingers
*   **F**lies
*   **F**omites
*   **F**ields (Soil/Food)

### Assessment of Dehydration
This is critical for management. Based on the WHO "Look, Feel, Decide" chart.

| Signs | **No Dehydration** (Plan A) | **Some Dehydration** (Plan B) | **Severe Dehydration** (Plan C) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Condition** | Well, alert | Restless, irritable | Lethargic, unconscious, floppy |
| **Eyes** | Normal | Sunken | Very sunken and dry |
| **Thirst** | Drinks normally, not thirsty | **Thirsty, drinks eagerly** | Drinks poorly or unable to drink |
| **Skin Pinch** | Goes back quickly | **Goes back slowly** (< 2 secs) | **Goes back very slowly** (> 2 secs) |

### Control and Management

The sheet anchor of treatment is [[Oral Rehydration Therapy]] (ORT).

#### 1. Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS)
The **New Reduced Osmolarity ORS** (Total Osmolarity: **245 mmol/L**) is recommended as it reduces stool output by 20% and vomiting by 30% compared to standard ORS.

**Composition of Reduced Osmolarity ORS:**

| Component | Amount (grams/liter) | Concentration (mmol/liter) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sodium Chloride** | 2.6 | Sodium: 75 |
| **Glucose, anhydrous** | 13.5 | Glucose: 75 |
| **Potassium Chloride** | 1.5 | Potassium: 20 |
| **Trisodium Citrate** | 2.9 | Citrate: 10 |
| | | **Chloride: 65** |

**Clinical Relevance:** If ORS packets are unavailable, **Home Available Fluids (HAF)** like rice water, dal water, or buttermilk can be used to prevent dehydration.

#### 2. Zinc Supplementation
Zinc is used as an adjunct to ORS.
*   **Dosage:** **20 mg/day** for 14 days (children >6 months); **10 mg/day** (infants 2–6 months).
*   **Benefits:** Reduces duration/severity of the episode and decreases incidence of subsequent episodes for 2–3 months.

#### 3. Appropriate Feeding
*   **Do not** rest the gut.
*   Continue **breastfeeding** frequently.
*   Give nutrient-rich food as soon as the child can eat to prevent malnutrition.

#### 4. Chemotherapy (Antibiotics)
*   **Not indicated** in routine cases.
*   **Indicated only for:**
    *   **Cholera** (Tetracycline/Doxycycline).
    *   **Shigella Dysentery** (Ciprofloxacin/Ceftriaxone).
    *   **Amebiasis** (Metronidazole).
    *   **Giardiasis** (Metronidazole).

### Prevention Strategies

#### 1. Sanitation and Hygiene
*   **Hand washing** with soap (most effective single measure).
*   Sanitary disposal of excreta (Sanitary latrines).
*   Safe drinking water supply.

#### 2. Immunization
*   [[Rotavirus Vaccine]]: Included in the National Immunization Schedule to prevent severe diarrhea.
*   [[Measles Vaccine]]: Prevents up to 25% of diarrheal deaths (diarrhea is a major complication of measles).

#### 3. Child Health Practices
*   **Exclusive Breastfeeding** for the first 6 months.
*   Improved weaning practices (hygienic preparation of complementary foods).
*   Vitamin A supplementation.
