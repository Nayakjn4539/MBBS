# Extraocular Muscles (EOM)

The [[extraocular muscles]] are a set of six muscles per eye responsible for the movement of the [[eyeball]], plus one muscle responsible for eyelid elevation ([[levator palpebrae superioris]]). They are essential for maintaining [[binocular single vision]] and directing the [[visual axis]].

## Gross Anatomy: Origin and Insertion

The four [[rectus muscles]] and the [[superior oblique]] originate from the orbital apex, while the [[inferior oblique]] originates anteriorly.

### 1. Rectus Muscles
All four rectus muscles arise from a common tendinous ring called the [[Annulus of Zinn]], which encircles the [[optic foramen]] and the medial part of the [[superior orbital fissure]].

*   **Course:** They run forward around the [[eyeball]] and insert into the [[sclera]] anterior to the equator.
*   **Insertion ([[Spiral of Tillaux]]):** The tendons insert at varying distances from the [[limbus]]. An imaginary line connecting these insertions forms a spiral.

| Muscle | Distance from Limbus (mm) |
| :--- | :--- |
| [[Medial Rectus]] (MR) | 5.5 mm |
| [[Inferior Rectus]] (IR) | 6.5 mm |
| [[Lateral Rectus]] (LR) | 6.9 mm |
| [[Superior Rectus]] (SR) | 7.7 mm |

**Mnemonic:** **MILS** (Medial, Inferior, Lateral, Superior — closest to furthest).,

### 2. Oblique Muscles
These insert into the [[sclera]] **posterior** to the equator.

*   **[[Superior Oblique]] (SO):**
    *   **Origin:** From the [[sphenoid bone]] (lesser wing) above and medial to the [[optic foramen]] (anatomical origin).
    *   **Course:** Runs forward to the [[trochlea]] (a cartilaginous pulley at the superomedial orbital rim), hooks around it, and turns backward and laterally (functional origin).
    *   **Insertion:** Passes under the [[superior rectus]] to insert into the superolateral [[sclera]] behind the equator.
*   **[[Inferior Oblique]] (IO):**
    *   **Origin:** From the orbital plate of the [[maxilla]] (orbital floor) lateral to the [[nasolacrimal duct]]. **Note:** This is the only EOM *not* arising from the orbital apex.
    *   **Insertion:** Passes laterally and backward below the [[inferior rectus]] to insert into the posterolateral [[sclera]].

### 3. Levator Palpebrae Superioris (LPS)
*   **Origin:** Lesser wing of the [[sphenoid]] at the orbital apex.
*   **Insertion:** Eyelid skin, [[tarsal plate]], and conjunctiva.
*   **Function:** Elevation of the upper eyelid.

## Nerve Supply

The EOMs are supplied by the **3rd**, **4th**, and **6th** [[cranial nerves]].

| Nerve | Muscles Supplied |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Oculomotor Nerve]] (CN III)** | **Superior Division:** [[Superior Rectus]], [[Levator Palpebrae Superioris]]<br>**Inferior Division:** [[Medial Rectus]], [[Inferior Rectus]], [[Inferior Oblique]] |
| **[[Trochlear Nerve]] (CN IV)** | [[Superior Oblique]] |
| **[[Abducens Nerve]] (CN VI)** | [[Lateral Rectus]] |

**Mnemonic:** **LR6 SO4** (Lateral Rectus by 6th, Superior Oblique by 4th, rest by 3rd).

## Actions of Extraocular Muscles

The eye rotates around a [[center of rotation]] located roughly 13mm behind the cornea.
*   **Horizontal Recti (MR, LR):** Have only primary actions because their muscle planes coincide with the horizontal plane.
*   **Vertical Recti (SR, IR) & Obliques (SO, IO):** Have primary, secondary, and tertiary actions because their muscle axes form angles with the [[visual axis]] (23° for recti, 51° for obliques).

### Table of Actions (in Primary Position)

| Muscle | Primary Action | Secondary Action | Tertiary Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Medial Rectus]]** | Adduction | None | None |
| **[[Lateral Rectus]]** | Abduction | None | None |
| **[[Superior Rectus]]** | Elevation | Intorsion | Adduction |
| **[[Inferior Rectus]]** | Depression | Extorsion | Adduction |
| **[[Superior Oblique]]** | Intorsion | Depression | Abduction |
| **[[Inferior Oblique]]** | Extorsion | Elevation | Abduction |,

**Mnemonics for Actions:**
1.  **RAD:** **R**ecti are **AD**ductors (except Lateral Rectus).
2.  **SIN:** **S**uperiors are **IN**torters (Superior Rectus, Superior Oblique).
3.  **Obliques are Abductors.**

### Diagnostic Positions of Gaze (Clinical Action)
To isolate the function of a muscle, the eye is moved into a position where the muscle's axis aligns with the [[visual axis]].

*   **SR:** Elevates best in **Abduction** (23°).
*   **IR:** Depresses best in **Abduction** (23°).
*   **SO:** Depresses best in **Adduction** (51°).
*   **IO:** Elevates best in **Adduction** (51°).

## Physiology of Ocular Motility

### Types of Eye Movements
1.  **Ductions:** Uniocular movements (e.g., [[Adduction]], [[Abduction]], [[Supraduction]]).
2.  **Versions:** Binocular conjugate movements (eyes move in the same direction).
    *   *Dextroversion:* Right gaze.
    *   *Levoversion:* Left gaze.
3.  **Vergences:** Binocular disjugate movements (eyes move in opposite directions).
    *   *[[Convergence]]:* Eyes move inward.
    *   *[[Divergence]]:* Eyes move outward.,

### Laws of Ocular Motility

#### 1. [[Agonist]] and [[Antagonist]]
*   **Agonist:** The muscle contracting to move the eye.
*   **Antagonist:** The muscle in the same eye that opposes the movement (e.g., MR is the antagonist to LR).

#### 2. [[Yoke Muscles]] (Contralateral Synergists)
A pair of muscles (one in each eye) that produce conjugate movement.
*   *Example in Dextroversion (Right Gaze):* Right LR and Left MR.

#### 3. [[Sherrington's Law of Reciprocal Innervation]]
Relates to muscles in the **same eye**.
*   **Statement:** Increased innervation to an agonist muscle is accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in innervation to its antagonist.
*   *Example:* During abduction, the LR contracts while the MR relaxes.

#### 4. [[Hering's Law of Equal Innervation]]
Relates to **binocular movements**.
*   **Statement:** Equal and simultaneous innervation flows to the [[yoke muscles]] of both eyes.
*   *Example:* In looking right, the Right LR and Left MR receive equal nerve impulses.
*   *Clinical Implication:* In [[paralytic squint]], the secondary deviation (when the paretic eye fixes) is greater than the primary deviation because excessive innervation is sent to the paretic muscle to fixate, and this excessive signal is simultaneously sent to the normal yoke muscle, causing a massive overshoot.,

## Blood Supply of EOMs

The muscles are supplied by muscular branches of the **[[ophthalmic artery]]**.
*   **Lateral Branch:** Supplies LR, SR, SO.
*   **Medial Branch:** Supplies MR, IR, IO.

**Clinical Importance (Anterior Segment Ischemia):**
The rectus muscles give off **[[anterior ciliary arteries]]** (2 from each rectus, except LR which has 1). These supply the anterior segment of the eye.
*   During squint surgery, detaching 3 or 4 rectus muscles can cut off blood supply to the anterior segment, causing [[anterior segment ischemia]].

---

## Clinical Implications

1.  **[[Strabismus]] (Squint):** Misalignment of visual axes. Can be comitant (angle constant) or incomitant (angle varies, e.g., paralytic).
2.  **[[Paralytic Squint]]:**
    *   **CN III Palsy:** Eye is "Down and Out" (unopposed LR and SO), [[ptosis]], [[mydriasis]].
    *   **CN IV Palsy:** Vertical diplopia, head tilt to the **opposite** shoulder (Bielschowsky's head tilt test).
    *   **CN VI Palsy:** Convergent squint ([[esotropia]]), limitation of abduction.
3.  **[[Thyroid Eye Disease]] (Graves'):** Causes restrictive myopathy. The [[inferior rectus]] is most commonly involved, causing limitation of elevation.
4.  **[[Brown's Syndrome]]:** Fibrosis/restriction of the [[superior oblique]] tendon sheath, causing limitation of elevation in adduction.
5.  **[[Duane's Retraction Syndrome]]:** Congenital miswiring where LR is supplied by CN III. Leads to globe retraction and narrowing of palpebral fissure on adduction.
