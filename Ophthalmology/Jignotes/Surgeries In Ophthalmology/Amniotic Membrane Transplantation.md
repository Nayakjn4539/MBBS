# [[Surgeries In Ophthalmology]] > Amniotic Membrane Transplantation

# Amniotic Membrane Transplantation (AMT)

[[Amniotic Membrane Transplantation]] (AMT) is a surgical procedure utilized for ocular surface reconstruction. The [[amniotic membrane]] acts as a substrate for epithelial growth, reduces inflammation, and inhibits vascularization and fibrosis.

### Indications for AMT
Based on clinical severity and condition, AMT is indicated in:
*   **Chemical Burns:** To promote healing in severe burns (Grade IV) or poor corneal healing with [[limbal stem cell deficiency]].
*   **Pterygium Surgery:** As a graft material to cover the defect after excision, although [[conjunctival limbal autograft]] (CLAU) is generally preferred.
*   **Symblepharon:** To cover raw areas after symblepharectomy to prevent recurrence of adhesions.
*   **Persistent Epithelial Defects:** For non-healing corneal ulcers.
*   **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS):** Used in the acute phase for ocular surface coverage.

### Surgical Instrumentation

The following instruments are essential for performing AMT and handling the delicate ocular tissues.

#### 1. Eye Speculums
These are used to separate the eyelids and maintain exposure of the eyeball during surgery.

*   **Universal Metallic Eye Speculum:**
    *   Can be used for either the right or left eye.
    *   Has two limbs with a spring mechanism and a screw to adjust the width of the blades.
    *   **Blades:** Open wire design.
*   **Eye Speculum with Guard (Solid Blades):**
    *   Similar to the universal speculum but features solid blades.
    *   **Function:** Retracts lids while keeping the [[eyelashes]] away from the surgical field, providing a clear view.
*   **Wire Speculum:**
    *   Very light weight.
    *   Causes minimal pressure on the eyeball.

#### 2. Plain Dissecting Forceps
Also known as **Plain Forceps** (without teeth).

*   **Structure:** Simple forceps with serrations (horizontal or vertical) near the tip but lacking teeth.
*   **Uses:**
    *   **Holding Tissue:** To hold the [[conjunctiva]] or the amniotic membrane graft during positioning.
    *   **Suturing:** To tie sutures during the procedure.
    *   **Tissue Handling:** To hold the scleral flap or skin during various eyelid surgeries.

> **Clinical Implication:** Toothed forceps (like [[Globe fixation forceps]] or [[Corneo-scleral forceps]]) are avoided when handling the delicate amniotic membrane to prevent tearing the graft,.

#### 3. Conjunctival Scissors
Used for cutting and dissecting the conjunctiva and the amniotic graft.

*   **Plain Curved Scissors (Ringed):**
    *   Fine-pointed scissors with curved, sharp cutting blades.
    *   **Uses:** Used to cut and undermine the conjunctiva and to fashion the amniotic membrane graft to the required size.
*   **Spring Scissors ([[Westcott's scissors]]):**
    *   Stout scissors with blades kept apart by spring action.
    *   **Uses:** A handy alternative to ringed scissors for cutting sutures and undermining conjunctiva.

#### 4. Needle Holder
Used to grasp and drive the needle during suturing of the graft to the episclera or conjunctiva.

*   **Spring Action ([[Barraquer's needle holder]]):**
    *   Available with straight or curved tips, with or without a lock.
    *   **Jaws:** Finely serrated to hold fine needles firmly.
    *   **Use:** Ideal for passing fine sutures (e.g., 10-0 nylon or 8-0 vicryl) through the conjunctiva, cornea, and sclera.
*   **[[Castroviejo's needle holder]]:**
    *   Medium-sized spring action holder with an S-shaped locking system.
    *   **Use:** Generally used in extraocular surgery (conjunctiva suturing).

#### 5. Suture Tier Forceps
While specific "tying forceps" exist, other instruments are commonly adapted for this role in ocular surgery.

*   **Plain Forceps:** As noted above, plain forceps are routinely used to tie sutures.
*   **[[Kelman-McPherson forceps]]:**
    *   **Structure:** Fine forceps with bent limbs.
    *   **Uses:** Originally for [[intraocular lens]] (IOL) implantation, they are excellent for suture tying due to their fine tips.

### Procedure Overview (Context of Instruments)

1.  **Exposure:** The [[Eye Speculum]] is inserted to retract eyelids.
2.  **Preparation:** The pathological tissue (e.g., pterygium or pannus) is excised using **Conjunctival Scissors** and **Plain Forceps**.
3.  **Graft Preparation:** The [[amniotic membrane]] is trimmed to size using **Conjunctival Scissors**.
4.  **Fixation:** The membrane is secured to the episclera or conjunctiva.
    *   The needle is driven using the **Needle Holder** (Barraquer or Castroviejo).
    *   The graft is stabilized using **Plain Forceps**.
    *   Knots are tied using **Suture Tier Forceps** (Plain or Kelman-McPherson).
    *   Alternatively, [[fibrin glue]] or autologous blood may be used for fixation.
