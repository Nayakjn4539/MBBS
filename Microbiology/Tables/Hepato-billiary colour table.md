Intermediate is sheep. Man is an accidental intermediate (dead end). **Transmission:** Ingestion of eggs from food contaminated with dog feces. **Pathogenesis:** Embryo hatches, penetrates intestinal wall, carried via portal circulation to liver (most common site) or lungs, where it develops into a hydatid cyst. | **Hydatid fluid** is toxic and can cause anaphylactic reaction on leakage. | Usually asymptomatic for years.
