# [[Irritant Poisons (Animal)]] > Vipers

### Vipers (Vasculotoxic Snakes)

Vipers belong to the family **Viperidae**. They are characterized by their specialized venom apparatus and hemotoxic/vasculotoxic venom. They are broadly classified into two subfamilies:
1.  **Viperinae** (True Vipers / Pitless Vipers): e.g., [[Russell's Viper]], [[Saw-scaled Viper]].
2.  **Crotalinae** (Pit Vipers): Characterized by a loreal pit (thermoreceptor) between the eye and nostril. e.g., Common Green Pit Viper, Hump-nosed Viper.

### Identification Features
| Feature | Vipers (Viperidae) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Head** | Large, triangular (arrow-shaped), wider than neck, covered with **small scales**. |
| **Pupils** | **Vertical** (slit-like/cat-like). |
| **Fangs** | **Long**, mobile, canalized (hollow like hypodermic needles), hinged (fold back when mouth is closed). |
| **Tail** | Tapers abruptly (short tail). |
| **Reproduction** | **Viviparous** (gives birth to live young) - *Except some pit vipers*. |
| **Habit** | Mostly nocturnal. |

### Important Species in India ("The Big Four")
*Two of the "Big Four" venomous snakes in India are vipers:*

1.  **[[Russell's Viper]]** (*Daboia russelii*):
    *   **Appearance:** Robust, brownish body with **three rows of chain-like/diamond-shaped** dark spots on the dorsum.
    *   **Behavior:** Hisses loudly (like a pressure cooker) when threatened.
    *   **Toxicity:** Causes severe hemotoxicity and renal failure.
2.  **[[Saw-scaled Viper]]** (*Echis carinatus*):
    *   **Appearance:** Small snake. Head has a whitish **arrow-shaped** or bird-foot mark. Body has wavy white lines.
    *   **Behavior:** Rubs its serrated scales together to produce a "sawing" or rasping sound (stridulation). Very aggressive.
    *   **Toxicity:** Severe coagulopathy.

### Mechanism of Action (Venom)
The venom is primarily **[[Vasculotoxic]]** and **[[Hemotoxic]]** (cytolytic).
*   **Enzymes:** Rich in proteases, hydrolases, hyaluronidase, and phospholipase.
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   **Endothelial damage:** Increases vascular permeability leading to massive local edema and fluid loss (shock).
    *   **Coagulopathy:** Activates clotting factors (Factor X, V, Prothrombin) leading to Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) and subsequent consumption coagulopathy (incoagulable blood).
    *   **Hemolysis:** Destruction of Red Blood Cells.
    *   **Cytotoxicity:** Direct tissue necrosis.

### Clinical Features (Signs and Symptoms)
Unlike neurotoxic bites (Cobra/Krait), viper bites are marked by severe local tissue destruction.

#### 1. Local Signs (Prominent)
*   **Pain:** Immediate, severe, burning pain at the bite site.
*   **Swelling:** Rapid onset (within 15 mins). Massive edema that spreads proximally and may involve the whole limb or trunk.
*   **Discoloration:** Site becomes purplish/black due to extravasation of blood.
*   **Blisters:** Formation of serous or hemorrhagic bullae/blisters around the bite.
*   **Oozing:** Continuous trickling of blood from fang marks.
*   **Necrosis:** Tissue death leading to **gangrene** (wet or dry).

#### 2. Systemic Signs (Hemotoxic)
*   **Bleeding Diathesis:** Spontaneous bleeding from gums, nose (epistaxis), rectum (melena).
*   **Hematuria:** Blood in urine is a common early sign.
*   **Ecchymoses:** Subconjunctival hemorrhages and patches of bruising under the skin.
*   **Shock:** Hypotension, tachycardia, cold clammy skin (due to fluid loss into tissues and internal bleeding).

#### 3. Specific Organ Damage
*   **[[Renal Failure]]:** Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN) is the **most common cause of death** in viper bites (especially Russell's Viper). Features include oliguria/anuria and uremia.
*   **Endocrine:** Russell's viper venom can cause hemorrhage into the anterior pituitary gland, leading to **Sheehan-like syndrome** (hypopituitarism). Long-term sequelae include loss of axillary/pubic hair, amenorrhea, and testicular atrophy.

### Diagnosis
*   **Visual:** Identification of the snake (if killed/captured).
*   **[[20 WBCT]] (20 Minute Whole Blood Clotting Test):**
    *   Take 2 ml of fresh venous blood in a clean, dry glass tube.
    *   Keep undisturbed for 20 minutes.
    *   Tilt the tube. If blood remains liquid (doesn't clot), it indicates **incoagulable blood**. This confirms hemotoxic envenomation (Viper bite).
*   **Lab:** PT/aPTT prolonged, Fibrinogen decreased, FDP increased (DIC profile). Urine shows RBCs/Hemoglobin.

### Management
**1. First Aid:**
*   **Immobilize** the limb (splinting).
*   **Reassurance** (fear causes hypotension).
*   **Do NOT** use tourniquets (increases risk of local necrosis in viper bites).
*   **Do NOT** incise or suck the wound.

**2. Specific Antidote:**
*   **[[Polyvalent Anti-Snake Venom]] (ASV):**
    *   It neutralizes circulating venom.
    *   Effective against Russell's Viper and Saw-scaled Viper.
    *   **Dose:** Usually 10 vials (mixed in saline) IV infusion over 1 hour. Repeat if clotting time does not normalize after 6 hours or if bleeding persists.

**3. Supportive Treatment:**
*   **Shock:** IV fluids (crystalloids), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), or whole blood for coagulopathy.
*   **Renal Failure:** Hemodialysis may be required.
*   **Antibiotics:** To prevent secondary infection in necrotic tissue.
*   **Tetanus Toxoid:** Prophylaxis.
*   **Surgical:** Debridement of necrotic tissue; fasciotomy if compartment syndrome develops (rare, usually conservative management preferred).

### Autopsy Findings
*   **External:**
    *   **Fang Marks:** Usually two distinct deep punctures (approx. 2.5 cm deep), often with oozing blood.
    *   **Local:** Severe swelling, cellulitis, blistering, and necrosis/gangrene of the affected limb.
*   **Internal:**
    *   **General:** Blood is fluid and dark (incoagulable). Generalized visceral congestion.
    *   **Hemorrhages:** Petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages on pleura, pericardium, endocardium, and meninges.
    *   **Kidneys:** Swollen, congested (Acute Tubular Necrosis).
    *   **Mucosa:** Hemorrhagic mucosa of stomach and intestines.

### Medicolegal Aspects
*   Mostly **Accidental** (farmers, laborers walking in fields).
*   **Homicide:** Rare due to pain and visible local damage, but historically documented.
*   **Suicide:** Very rare (painful method).
