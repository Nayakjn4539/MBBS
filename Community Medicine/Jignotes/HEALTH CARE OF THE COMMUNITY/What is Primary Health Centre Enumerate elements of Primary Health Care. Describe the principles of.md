### Principles of Primary Health Care

There are four pillars or principles that support the concept of Primary Health Care.

1.  **[[Equitable Distribution]]:** Health services must be shared equally by all people irrespective of their ability to pay. It aims to redress the imbalance between urban and rural health care by shifting the focus to rural areas where the majority of the population lives.
2.  **[[Community Participation]]:** Involvement of individuals, families, and communities in promoting their own health and welfare. It emphasizes self-reliance and ensures that health programmes are not just government-imposed but accepted by the people (e.g., ASHA, Village Health Guides).
3.  **[[Intersectoral Coordination]]:** Health cannot be improved by the health sector alone. It requires the joint effort of related sectors such as agriculture, animal husbandry, food, industry, education, housing, and public works.
4.  **[[Appropriate Technology]]:** The technology used should be scientifically sound, adaptable to local needs, acceptable to those who apply it, and affordable for the community and country (e.g., ORS, vaccine vial monitors).
