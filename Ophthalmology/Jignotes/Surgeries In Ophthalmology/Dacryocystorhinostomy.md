# Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR)

**Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR)** is a surgical procedure aimed at establishing a low-resistance drainage pathway between the [[lacrimal sac]] and the [[nasal cavity]] (specifically the [[middle meatus]]). This bypasses an obstruction in the [[nasolacrimal duct]] (NLD).

### Indications
*   **[[Chronic dacryocystitis]]**: The most common indication, usually due to post-saccal obstruction.
*   **[[Nasolacrimal duct obstruction]] (NLDO)**: Acquired or congenital (after failed probing/intubation after 4 years of age).
*   **[[Lacrimal sac]] mucocele/pyocele**.
*   Chronic **[[epiphora]]** with patency of canaliculi but blocked NLD.
*   Failed previous DCR.

### Instrumentation for External DCR

The following instruments are essential for performing an external DCR. They facilitate exposure, bone removal (osteotomy), and flap suturing.

| Instrument | Description | Surgical Use in DCR |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Bard-Parker Handle]] (Scalpel Handle)** | Handle used to hold surgical blades (usually No. 11 or 15). | Used to make the initial **skin incision** (curved or straight) 8mm medial to the medial canthus. |
| **[[Artery Forceps]] (Haemostatic Forceps)** | Blunt-tipped stout forceps with a locking mechanism and transverse serrations. | 1. Catching bleeding vessels (haemostasis).<br>2. Holding **gauze pellets** ("peanuts") for blunt dissection of the lacrimal sac.<br>3. Traction sutures. |
| **[[Punctum Dilator]] (Nettleship’s)** | Cylindrical corrugated handle with a conical pointed tip. | Used to **dilate the [[punctum]]** and [[canaliculus]] to allow entry of the lacrimal probe. |
| **[[Lacrimal Probe]] (Bowman’s)** | Silver/metal wires of varying thickness (Size 0-8) with blunt rounded ends. | 1. Introduced through the canaliculus into the sac to **identify the sac** location during dissection.<br>2. To tent the medial wall of the sac before incision. |
| **[[Lacrimal Cannula]]** | Long curved hypodermic needle with a blunt tip. | Used for **[[lacrimal syringing]]** to verify patency of the system post-operatively or intra-operatively. |
| **[[Lacrimal Dissector]] with Scoop** | Cylindrical instrument; one end is a blunt dissector, the other a curette (scoop). | 1. **Dissector:** Separates the lacrimal sac from the lacrimal fossa.<br>2. **Scoop:** Curettes out infective material, granulations, or membranous NLD remnants. |
| **[[Muller’s Retractor]]** | Self-retaining retractor with curved pins/claws and a fixing screw. | **Retracts the skin** incision edges to maintain exposure of the surgical field without needing an assistant. |
| **[[Cat’s Paw Retractor]]** | Fork-like instrument with terminals bent inward. | Used manually to **retract skin** and soft tissues during dissection. |
| **[[Bone Punch]] (e.g., Citelli's)** | Stout spring handle; upper blade has a cutting edge, lower blade is cup-like. | Used to **enlarge the bony osteum** (rhinostomy) by punching out bone from the margins (lacrimal bone and frontal process of maxilla). |
| **[[Hammer]]** | Small steel hammer with a corrugated handle. | Used to strike the **chisel** during the creation of the bony window (osteotomy). |
| **[[Chisel]]** | Blade with a sharp straight cutting edge (bevelled on one surface) and stout handle. | Used to **cut the bone** (anterior lacrimal crest) to create the initial opening into the nasal cavity. |
| **[[Bone Gouge]]** | Stout handle with a longitudinally scooped end and sharp edges. | Used to **smoothen irregular bony margins** after using the chisel or punch. |
| **[[Rougine]] (Freer’s Periosteum Elevator)** | Double-ended instrument with slightly curved, tear-drop tips. | Used to **elevate the [[periosteum]]** from the anterior lacrimal crest and lacrimal fossa before bone removal. |
| **[[Needle Holder]]** | Used to grasp and drive the needle. | Used for suturing the nasal and lacrimal sac flaps (anastomosis) and closing the skin. |
| **[[Silcock’s Needle Holder]]** | Large needle holder with a flat, broad plate on the upper shank for the surgeon’s thumb. | Specifically designed for firm grip during **skin and muscle suturing** in adnexal surgeries like DCR. |

### Surgical Steps (External DCR)

The procedure is typically performed under **General Anaesthesia** (preferred) or Local Anaesthesia.

1.  **Incision:** A curvilinear or straight skin incision is made 8-10mm medial to the medial canthus using a **Scalpel (BP Handle)**.
2.  **Exposure:** The **Muller’s Retractor** or **Cat’s Paw Retractor** is placed to expose the underlying orbicularis muscle and Medial Palpebral Ligament (MPL).
3.  **Dissection:** The MPL is divided. The **Periosteum** is incised and reflected laterally using the **Rougine (Periosteum Elevator)** to expose the anterior lacrimal crest and lacrimal fossa. The lacrimal sac is reflected laterally.
4.  **Osteotomy (Bony Window):**
    *   The anterior lacrimal crest is removed using a **Chisel** and **Hammer** or a motor drill.
    *   The bony opening (osteum) is enlarged (approx 12x10 mm) using a **Bone Punch** to expose the underlying nasal mucosa.
    *   Margins are smoothed with a **Bone Gouge**.
5.  **Flap Preparation:**
    *   A **Lacrimal Probe** is passed through the lower canaliculus to tent the medial wall of the sac.
    *   Vertical incisions are made in the medial wall of the [[lacrimal sac]] and the exposed [[nasal mucosa]] to create **anterior and posterior flaps** ("H" shaped incision).
6.  **Anastomosis:**
    *   The posterior flaps of the sac and nasal mucosa are sutured together using **absorbable sutures** (e.g., 6-0 Vicryl) held by a **Needle Holder**.
    *   The anterior flaps are similarly sutured over the probe.
7.  **Closure:** The MPL is re-sutured, and the skin is closed (usually with 6-0 Silk or Nylon) using **Silcock’s Needle Holder**.

**Clinical Implication:**
Careless use of the **Bone Punch** can cause accidental damage to the nasal mucosa or the nasal septum, leading to haemorrhage or synechiae formation.

### Variants of DCR

| Feature | External DCR | Endonasal DCR |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Approach** | Skin incision near medial canthus. | Through the nasal cavity using an [[endoscope]]. |
| **Scar** | Visible cutaneous scar. | No external scar. |
| **Bone Removal** | Chisel/Hammer/Punch. | Kerrison punch or Drill or Laser. |
| **Visualization** | Direct visualization of sac and flaps. | Excellent view of intranasal pathology (deviated septum, polyps). |
| **Success Rate** | High (~90-95%). | Slightly lower (70-90%), dependent on surgeon skill. |
| **Instruments** | Retractors, Chisel, Silcock's needle holder. | Endoscope, Sickle knife, Kerrison's punch. |

### Complications

*   **Intra-operative:** [[Haemorrhage]] (angular vein or nasal mucosa injury), injury to internal structures (cribriform plate - rare), loss of vitreous (very rare, if accidental orbital entry).
*   **Post-operative:**
    *   **Early:** Periorbital ecchymosis (black eye), wound infection, epistaxis.
    *   **Late:** Scarring (webbing), closure of osteotomy site (failed DCR), sump syndrome.
