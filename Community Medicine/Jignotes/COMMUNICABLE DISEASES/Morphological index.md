# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Morphological index

### Morphological Index (MI)

**Context:** [[Leprosy]] (Hansen's Disease) Bacteriology.

**Definition:**
The Morphological Index (MI) is the percentage of **solid-staining** (viable) bacilli out of the total number of bacilli counted in a smear. It allows the differentiation between living (viable) and dead (non-viable) *Mycobacterium leprae*.

**Procedure:**
1.  Smears are stained using the **Ziehl-Neelsen** method.
2.  The observer examines **[[200 pink-stained free-standing]]** bacilli (bacilli not in clumps/globi).
3.  The bacilli are categorized as either **Solid** (Uniformly stained) or **Irregular** (Fragmented/Granular).

**Calculation:**
The MI is calculated using the following formula:

$$ \text{Morphological Index (MI)} = \frac{\text{Number of solid staining bacilli}}{200} \times 100 $$

*   If smears are taken from multiple sites, the average MI for the body is calculated by dividing the total MIs by the number of sites examined.

### Criteria for "Solid" Rods (Viable Bacilli)
For a bacillus to be counted as "Solid" (Viable), it must fulfill **all** of the following characteristics:

1.  **Uniform staining** of the entire organism.
2.  **Parallel sides**.
3.  **Rounded ends**.
4.  **Length 5 times** that of the width.

> **Mnemonic: PLUS** (To be **PLUS** [positive/viable], the bacteria needs:)
> *   **P** - **P**arallel sides
> *   **L** - **L**ength is 5x width
> *   **U** - **U**niform staining
> *   **S** - **S**hape of ends is Rounded

**Note:** Granular and fragmented bacilli cannot be cultured in mouse footpads and are considered dead/non-viable.

### Clinical Relevance and Utility
The MI is biologically more significant than the [[Bacteriological Index]] (BI) for the following reasons:

1.  **Indicator of Viability:** High MI indicates a large proportion of living bacilli, meaning the patient is highly infectious.
2.  **Response to Treatment:** MI is a valuable indicator of the patient's response to chemotherapy during the **first few months**.
    *   Under effective [[Multidrug therapy (MDT)]], the MI falls to **zero** (0%) much faster (usually within 3–5 weeks) than the BI (which takes years to become negative).
3.  **Drug Resistance/Compliance:** If the MI remains high or shows a **rise after an initial decline**, it indicates either:
    *   Inadequate drug intake (Non-compliance).
    *   Development of [[drug resistance]].

**Comparison: MI vs. BI**

| Feature | Morphological Index (MI) | Bacteriological Index (BI) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Measures** | Viability (% of living bacilli) | Density (Total bacterial load) |
| **Formula** | % of solid rods | Logarithmic scale (0 to 6+) |
| **Change on Rx** | Falls to 0 rapidly (weeks) | Falls very slowly (years) |
| **Significance** | Infectivity & Early Prognosis | Total load & Late Prognosis |

### Solid-Fragmented-Granular (SFG) Percentage
This is a refinement of the MI. Instead of just "Solid" vs "Non-solid," the percentages of **Solid**, **Fragmented**, and **Granular** bacilli are recorded separately. This gives a better picture of bacterial morphology and is a more sensitive indicator of treatment response.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a microscopic field showing 'Solid bacilli' (perfectly rod-shaped, uniformly pink) vs. 'Fragmented bacilli' (broken pink segments) and 'Granular bacilli' (pink dots) on a blue background. Label Solid as 'Viable' and others as 'Non-viable'.
