# [[Affections Of Soft Tissues]] > Bursitis

### Definition and Anatomy
**[[Bursa]]**
*   A small, fluid-filled sac lined by [[synovial membrane]] containing capillary layers of [[synovial fluid]].
*   **Function:** Acts as a cushion to reduce friction between moving parts, typically located between [[tendon]] and bone, skin and bone, or muscle and bone.
*   **Adventitious Bursa:** A bursa that develops continuously at a site subjected to abnormal, constant friction or pressure (e.g., over the [[cuboid]] in neglected [[Congenital Talipes Equinovarus]] or the "Bunion" over the first metatarsal head).

**[[Bursitis]]**
*   Inflammation of the bursa.
*   It can be acute or chronic.

### Etiology and Pathogenesis
The inflammation is usually a result of:
1.  **Trauma:**
    *   **Repetitive Microtrauma:** Constant friction or pressure (most common cause).
    *   **Acute Direct Trauma:** Direct blow to the bursa causing bleeding ([[haemobursa]]).
2.  **Infection (Septic Bursitis):**
    *   **Pyogenic:** Commonly *[[Staphylococcus aureus]]*. Often due to direct inoculation (prick/abrasion) or spread from adjacent cellulitis.
    *   **Tubercular:** [[Tuberculous bursitis]] (e.g., trochanteric bursa).
3.  **Inflammatory/Metabolic Disorders:**
    *   [[Gout]] (Microcrystalline induced).
    *   [[Rheumatoid arthritis]].

### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Swelling:** Localized, often the primary complaint.
    *   **Pain:** Present in acute cases, infected cases, or when pressure is applied. Chronic cases may be painless or cause mild discomfort.
    *   **Restriction of Motion:** Usually due to pain or mechanical block.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Fluctuation:** A soft, well-defined, cystic swelling that fluctuates is characteristic.
    *   **Tenderness:** Marked in acute or infected cases.
    *   **Warmth and Erythema:** Signs of acute inflammation or infection (sepsis).
    *   **Transillumination:** Usually negative (unlike a [[ganglion]], though serous bursitis may transilluminate).

### Common Clinical Types of Bursitis

| Anatomical Site | Common Name/Eponym | Cause/Trigger |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Prepatellar Bursa** | **[[Housemaid's Knee]]** | Kneeling forward (friction between skin and [[patella]]). Common in carpet layers, maids. |
| **Infrapatellar Bursa** | **[[Clergyman's Knee]]** | Kneeling upright (friction between skin and [[tibial tuberosity]]). |
| **Olecranon Bursa** | **[[Student's Elbow]]** / **[[Miner's Elbow]]** | Resting elbows on a table while reading or working in mines. |
| **Ischial Bursa** | **[[Weaver's Bottom]]** / **[[Tailor's Bottom]]** | Prolonged sitting on hard surfaces (friction over [[ischial tuberosity]]). |
| **Greater Trochanter** | **[[Trochanteric Bursitis]]** | Friction of [[iliotibial band]] over greater trochanter. Common in runners. |
| **First Metatarsal Head** | **[[Bunion]]** | Tight footwear causing friction over the medial aspect of the great toe. |
| **Lateral Malleolus** | **[[Tailor's Ankle]]** | Sitting cross-legged (pressure on lateral malleolus). |
| **Retrocalcaneal Bursa** | **[[Pump Bump]]** | Friction from stiff heel counters in shoes (Haglund's deformity). |
| **Subacromial Bursa** | **[[Subacromial Bursitis]]** | Impingement against the [[acromion]]; part of [[rotator cuff]] pathology. |

### Diagnosis
1.  **Clinical Examination:** Usually diagnostic based on location and palpation.
2.  **Aspiration:** Essential if infection (septic bursitis) or crystal arthropathy ([[gout]]) is suspected. The fluid is sent for:
    *   Gram stain and Culture/Sensitivity.
    *   Cell count.
    *   Crystal analysis.
3.  **X-rays:** To rule out underlying bony pathology (e.g., [[osteochondroma]], bony spur, or calcification within the bursa).
4.  **Ultrasound/MRI:** To define the extent of the bursa and relationship to surrounding structures.

### Treatment

#### 1. Acute / Irritative / Traumatic Bursitis
*   **Rest:** Avoid aggravating movements or positions.
*   **Removal of Cause:** Stop kneeling (use knee pads), stop leaning on elbows, modify footwear.
*   **Cryotherapy:** Ice packs to reduce inflammation.
*   **Medication:** [[NSAIDs]] (Analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs).
*   **Compression:** Elastic bandage to reduce swelling.
*   **Aspiration:** If the bursa is tensely distended, aspiration under strict aseptic conditions followed by a compression bandage may be done.

#### 2. Chronic Bursitis
*   **Conservative:**
    *   Physiotherapy (e.g., stretching for trochanteric bursitis).
    *   Local injection of **[[Hydrocortisone]]** (corticosteroids) into the sac. *Note: Contraindicated if infection is suspected.*
*   **Surgical:**
    *   **Excision of Bursa:** Indicated for persistent, recurrent, or fibrosed bursae (e.g., excision of olecranon bursa).
    *   Excision of underlying bony prominence (e.g., [[Haglund's deformity]]).

#### 3. Infective (Septic) Bursitis
*   **Antibiotics:** Systemic antibiotics (e.g., [[Flucloxacillin]] or [[Cephalosporins]]) usually covering *Staphylococcus aureus*.
*   **Drainage:**
    *   Repeated aspiration or Incision and Drainage (I&D) if pus is present.
    *   **Bursectomy:** Surgical removal may be required for intractable infections or recurrent septic bursitis.
*   **Rest/Splintage:** To allow healing.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Differential Diagnosis:** Differentiate bursitis from [[septic arthritis]]. In septic arthritis, the joint range of motion is severely painful and restricted in all planes. In bursitis, joint motion is often preserved (unless full flexion stretches the skin over the inflamed bursa).
*   **Calcific Tendonitis:** Subacromial bursitis is often secondary to calcific deposits in the [[supraspinatus tendon]] rupturing into the bursa.

### Mnemonics
*   **"Kneeling Maids and Studying Students":**
    *   **M**aids = **P**repatellar (Maids Kneel **P**reviously/Forward).
    *   **C**lergy = **I**nfrapatellar (Clergy Kneel **I**n/Upright).
    *   **S**tudents = **O**lecranon (Students lean **O**n elbows).
