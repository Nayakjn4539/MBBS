# [[HEALTH CARE OF THE COMMUNITY]] > Principles of Primary Health Care

# Principles of Primary Health Care

[[Primary Health Care]] (PHC) is defined as essential health care made universally accessible to individuals and families in the community by means acceptable to them, through their full participation and at a cost that the community and country can afford.

The **Alma-Ata Declaration (1978)** outlined four fundamental principles (often called the pillars) of Primary Health Care.

### **Mnemonic: "EQUAl COMmunity INTERaction APProved"**
*   **EQUAl** – **Equitable Distribution**
*   **COMmunity** – **Community Participation**
*   **INTERaction** – **Intersectoral Coordination**
*   **APProved** – **Appropriate Technology**

### 1. Equitable Distribution
This is the first key principle in the PHC strategy.
*   **Concept:** Health services must be shared equally by all people irrespective of their ability to pay. All people (rich or poor, urban or rural) must have access to health services.
*   **Current Problem:** Health services are often concentrated in major towns and cities (where 75% of the health budget is spent), while the majority of the population (75%) lives in rural areas.
*   **Goal:** To redress this "social injustice" and imbalance by shifting the center of gravity of the health care system from cities to rural areas and urban slums.
*   **Key Action:** Reaching the [[vulnerable groups]] and the "social periphery".

### 2. Community Participation
Health cannot be "given" to the people; it must be earned and maintained by the individual.
*   **Concept:** Involvement of individuals, families, and communities in the promotion of their own health and welfare.
*   **Philosophy:** Shifting from "Health *for* the people" to "Health *by* the people" (placing people's health in people's hands).
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Meaningful involvement in planning, implementation, and maintenance of health services.
    *   Maximum reliance on local resources (manpower, money, materials).
*   **Examples in India:** Utilization of [[Village Health Guides]], trained [[Dais]], [[ASHA]] workers, and [[Anganwadi workers]]. These workers overcome cultural and communication barriers.

### 3. Intersectoral Coordination
Health is not an isolated sector; it is influenced by various other factors.
*   **Concept:** The components of PHC cannot be provided by the health sector alone. It involves all related sectors and aspects of national and community development.
*   **Involved Sectors:**
    *   Agriculture
    *   Animal Husbandry
    *   Food and Industry
    *   Education
    *   Housing
    *   Public Works (Water/Sanitation)
    *   Communication
*   **Requirement:** Strong political will and administrative planning are required to avoid unnecessary duplication of activities and ensure coordination.

### 4. Appropriate Technology
*   **Definition:** Technology that is **scientifically sound**, **adaptable** to local needs, and **acceptable** to those who apply it and those for whom it is used.
*   **Criteria:** It must be maintained by the people themselves in keeping with the principle of [[self-reliance]] and at a cost the community/country can afford.
*   **Misconception:** It does not mean using primitive methods; it means using the *right* method for the setting. Large, luxurious hospitals are often "inappropriate" for local rural needs.
*   **Examples:**
    *   [[Oral Rehydration Salts]] (ORS) for diarrhea instead of expensive IV fluids.
    *   Standpipes for water supply instead of individual house connections.
    *   Vaccine Vial Monitors (VVM) for cold chain maintenance.

### **Summary Table: The 4 Pillars of PHC**

| Principle | Core Concept | Key Objective |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Equitable Distribution** | Health services for all, regardless of ability to pay. | Redress social injustice; shift focus from urban to rural/slums. |
| **Community Participation** | People actively involved in their own health. | "Health by the people"; utilizing local resources like [[ASHA]]. |
| **Intersectoral Coordination** | Health involves Agriculture, Education, Housing, etc.. | Comprehensive development; sanitation, nutrition, and literacy. |
| **Appropriate Technology** | Scientifically sound, adaptable, and affordable methods. | Sustainable, low-cost interventions (e.g., [[ORS]]). |

### **Clinical Relevance**
*   **Community Participation:** When treating a patient from a rural background, a doctor must understand local beliefs. For example, involving local leaders or [[Dais]] can significantly increase the uptake of antenatal care or immunization, which might otherwise be rejected due to cultural barriers.
*   **Appropriate Technology:** In a resource-limited setting (like a PHC), diagnosing dehydration clinically and treating it with ORS is clinically superior and more "appropriate" than referring a patient hours away for IV fluids, which might delay treatment.
