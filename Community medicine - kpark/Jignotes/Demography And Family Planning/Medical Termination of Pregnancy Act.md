# [[Demography And Family Planning]] > Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act

### **The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act**

The [[Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act]] was passed by the Indian Parliament in **1971** and came into force on **April 1, 1972**. It legalizes abortion in India under specific conditions to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality resulting from [[unsafe abortions]].

Prior to this Act, abortion was a crime under the Indian Penal Code (Section 312), unless done to save the life of the mother.

### **Objectives of the Act**
1.  **Health Measure:** To protect the health and life of women from the hazards of illegal/unsafe abortions.
2.  **Humanitarian:** To offer relief in cases of sexual violence.
3.  **Eugenic:** To prevent the birth of children with serious physical or mental abnormalities.

---

### **Indications for MTP (Conditions for Termination)**
Pregnancy can be terminated legally only if one of the following conditions is met:

1.  **Therapeutic:** Continuation of pregnancy endangers the pregnant woman's life or causes grave injury to her **physical or mental health**.
2.  **Eugenic:** Substantial risk that the child, if born, would suffer from serious physical or mental abnormalities (e.g., [[Down's syndrome]], structural malformations).
3.  **Humanitarian:** Pregnancy caused by **rape**. (The anguish caused by such pregnancy is presumed to constitute grave injury to the mental health of the woman).
4.  **Social/Contraceptive Failure:** Pregnancy resulting from the **failure of any contraceptive device** or method used by a woman or her partner to limit the number of children.
    *   *Note:* Under the **MTP Amendment Act 2021**, this applies to *all* women (married or unmarried), whereas previously it applied largely to married women.
5.  **Environmental:** Where the actual or reasonably foreseeable environment (social/economic) could injure the mother's health.

MTP can only be performed at:
1.  A hospital established or maintained by the **Government**.
2.  A place approved for this purpose by the **Government/District Level Committee** (Private clinics/hospitals).
    *   Must have facilities for safe abortion, anesthesia, and emergency resuscitation (blood transfusion, etc.).

---

### **Documentation and Confidentiality**

*   **Custody:** The register is kept in the safe custody of the head of the institution. It is destroyed after **5 years**.
*   **Reporting:** Monthly reports are sent to the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) comprising statistical data (no names).

### **Methods of Termination**
*   **First Trimester (Up to 12 weeks):**
    *   Medical Abortion: [[Mifepristone]] (200 mg) + [[Misoprostol]] (800 mcg). FDA approved up to 9 weeks (63 days).

### **Clinical Relevance**
*   **Ectopic Pregnancy:** MTP Act does **not** apply to [[ectopic pregnancy]]; it can be terminated by any RMP irrespective of the place/training requirements of the Act because it is a life-threatening emergency.
*   **Emergency:** In a bona fide emergency (immediate threat to the woman's life), **ONE RMP** can perform MTP at **ANY place** (even non-approved) irrespective of the gestation period.
*   **Complications:** While MTP is safe, complications like incomplete abortion, hemorrhage, sepsis, and uterine perforation can occur, especially in second-trimester procedures.
