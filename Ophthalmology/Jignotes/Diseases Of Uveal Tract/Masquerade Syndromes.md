# [[Diseases Of Uveal Tract]] > Masquerade Syndromes

### Masquerade Syndromes

**Definition**
**Masquerade syndrome** refers to a clinical presentation of uveal inflammation ([[uveitis]]) that is **not** due to immune-mediated uveitis entities but mimics them. Such presentations are caused by certain neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions.

It denotes any condition which mimics uveitis.

**Classification**
Masquerade syndromes are broadly classified into two categories:

| Category | Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Neoplastic Masquerade Syndromes** | • **Lymphoid malignancies:** <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- Primary [[central nervous system]] lymphoma (PCNSL) <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- Primary [[vitreoretinal lymphoma]] (PVRL) <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- Systemic [[lymphoma]] <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- [[Leukemia]] <br> • **Non-lymphoid malignancies:** <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- [[Retinoblastoma]] <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- [[Uveal melanoma]] <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- [[Juvenile xanthogranuloma]] <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- [[Metastatic tumors]], |
| **Non-Neoplastic Masquerade Syndromes** | • [[Retinitis pigmentosa]] <br> • [[Ocular ischemic syndrome]] <br> • [[Retinal detachment]] (long-standing) <br> • [[Intraocular foreign body]] <br> • [[Pigment dispersion syndrome]] <br> • [[Amyloidosis]], |

### Neoplastic Masquerade Syndromes

#### 1. Primary Vitreoretinal Lymphoma (PVRL)
This is a distinct subtype of primary [[central nervous system]] lymphoma (PCNSL). The malignant cells are usually of B-cell lineage. It is a variant of extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

**Clinical Features:**
*   **Symptoms:** Unilateral blurred vision and [[floaters]]. Symptoms often become bilateral.
*   **Signs:**
    *   Mild [[anterior uveitis]] with [[keratic precipitates]] (KPs) and anterior chamber cells.
    *   **Vitritis:** Mild to severe, often obscuring the fundus view.
    *   **Subretinal infiltrates:** Large and multifocal yellow-white infiltrates.
    *   **Retinal vasculature:** Usually visible.
    *   **Exudative retinal detachment:** May occur in some cases.
    *   **Vascular occlusions:** May be present.

> **Clinical Implication:** A conspicuous and consistent feature that helps differentiate PVRL from true [[uveitis]] is the **absence of [[cystoid macular edema]] (CME)**.

**Diagnosis:**
*   Confirmed by **cytology** of vitreous samples or subretinal nodules.
*   [[Optical coherence tomography]] (OCT), [[Fundus fluorescein angiography]] (FFA), Ultrasound (USG), and MRI are supportive.

**Treatment:**
*   Systemic and local chemotherapy.
*   Radiotherapy.
*   **Note:** Both the eye and brain need to be treated simultaneously due to the association with CNS involvement.

#### 2. Retinoblastoma
[[Retinoblastoma]] is a malignant tumor of the retina in children that can mimic inflammation.

**Mechanisms of Masquerade:**
*   **Pseudouveitis:** Presents as apparent intraocular inflammation.
*   **Pseudohypopyon:** Tumor cells seeding into the anterior chamber can settle inferiorly, mimicking a [[hypopyon]] (pus in the anterior chamber).
*   **Diffuse Infiltrating Retinoblastoma:** Presents as a placoid thickness of the retina rather than a distinct mass, leading to late diagnosis.
*   **Necrosis:** Tumor necrosis can present as aseptic [[orbital cellulitis]].

#### 3. Malignant Melanoma
*   **Tumor Necrosis:** Necrosis within an intraocular tumor (like [[choroidal melanoma]]) can present as **sterile [[endophthalmitis]]**, mimicking a purulent infection.,
*   **Secondary Glaucoma:** Can occur due to tumor infiltration or angle closure, presenting with red eye and pain.

#### 4. Leukemia
*   Can present as **Leukemic retinopathy** or infiltrates mimicking uveitis.,
*   [[Anterior uveitis]] with hypopyon (composed of malignant cells) may occur.

### Non-Neoplastic Masquerade Syndromes

#### 1. Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP)
*   Can mimic posterior uveitis due to pigmentary changes, attenuated vessels, and waxy disc pallor.
*   Associated with cells in the vitreous which may be mistaken for vitritis.

#### 2. Intraocular Foreign Body (IOFB)
*   A retained foreign body can cause chronic irritation and inflammation (e.g., [[siderosis]] or [[chalcosis]]), mimicking chronic uveitis.
*   **Traumatic Uveitis:** Direct mechanical effects or chemical effects of the foreign body.

#### 3. Retinal Detachment (RD)
*   Long-standing [[retinal detachment]] is associated with low-grade inflammation (uveitis) due to the production of **endocular toxins**.
*   Can be misdiagnosed as uveitis with secondary detachment if the break is not found.

### Investigations for Masquerade Syndromes

Detailed investigations are required to rule out true uveitis and confirm the masquerade etiology:

1.  **Imaging:**
    *   **Ultrasound (USG) B-Scan:** To detect intraocular tumors (e.g., [[Choroidal melanoma]], [[Retinoblastoma]]) or retinal detachment in hazy media.
    *   **CT/MRI:** To evaluate orbital extension and CNS involvement (especially for Lymphoma and Rb).
    *   **Fluorescein Angiography (FFA):** To differentiate vascular pathologies and tumor circulation.

2.  **Biopsy/Cytology:**
    *   **Diagnostic Vitrectomy:** Vitreous biopsy is crucial for diagnosing [[endophthalmitis]] (culture) and [[Intraocular lymphoma]] (cytology).
    *   **Aqueous Tap:** For cytology and enzyme levels (e.g., LDH is raised in Retinoblastoma).,
    *   **Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB):** Rarely used for solid tumors.

3.  **Systemic Workup:**
    *   Complete blood counts (for Leukemia).
    *   Bone marrow biopsy.
    *   Neurological evaluation (for CNS Lymphoma).
