# [[Firearms And Ballistics]] > bullet fingerprinting

### **Bullet Fingerprinting (Ballistic Fingerprinting)**

**Bullet Fingerprinting** refers to the technique of identifying a specific [[firearm]] to the exclusion of all others by examining the unique markings (striations) left on a bullet after it has been fired through a rifled barrel. Just as no two humans have the same fingerprints, no two gun barrels produce the exact same markings on a bullet.

### **1. Principle**
When a bullet is fired, it is forced through the barrel of a [[rifled firearm]]. Since the bullet is slightly larger than the bore diameter, the harder metal of the barrel scratches the softer metal of the bullet.
*   **Basis:** The inner surface of every gun barrel has minute irregularities due to manufacturing defects, wear and tear, rust, and **metallic fouling** (particles of previous bullets sticking to the bore).
*   **Result:** These irregularities create unique scratches or **striations** on the bullet surface, which serve as the "fingerprint" of that specific weapon.

### **2. Classification of Markings on a Fired Bullet**

The markings found on a fired bullet are classified into two distinct types:

| Feature | **Primary Markings (Class Characteristics)** | **Secondary Markings (Individual Characteristics)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | Marks common to a specific make and model of the firearm. | Microscopic marks unique to *one specific gun* only. |
| **Cause** | Predetermined by the manufacturer design (Factory settings). | Caused by accidental irregularities, tool marks during manufacture, rust, corrosion, and metallic fouling. |
| **Includes** | 1. Caliber<br>2. Number of lands and grooves<br>3. Width of lands and grooves<br>4. Direction (twist) of rifling (Right or Left)<br>5. Pitch of rifling | **Striations** (fine parallel scratches) found within the land and groove impressions. |
| **Utility** | Identifies the **Make and Model** of the gun (e.g., A .38 caliber revolver). | Identifies the **Specific Weapon** to the exclusion of all others (Bullet Fingerprinting). |

> **Mnemonic for Markings:**
> *   **P**rimary = **P**roduction (Factory/Model details)
> *   **S**econdary = **S**pecific (Specific gun/Fingerprint)

### **3. Procedure of Identification**

To perform bullet fingerprinting, the **Crime Bullet** (recovered from the victim or scene) must be compared with a **Test Bullet** (fired from the suspect's weapon).

#### **Step 1: Recovery of the Crime Bullet (Exhibit Bullet)**
*   **At Autopsy:** Great care must be taken not to damage the striations on the bullet surface.
    *   Do **not** use toothed forceps or hemostats.
    *   Use rubber-tipped forceps or bare fingers to remove the bullet,.
    *   The bullet should be dried, wrapped in cotton, and packed in a cardboard box (not glass/metal containers to avoid scratching).
*   **Marking:** The doctor should mark the bullet for identification on the **base** (or ogive), never on the rifling marks or the nose.

#### **Step 2: Obtaining a Test Bullet**
The ballistic expert fires the suspected weapon using similar ammunition into a recovery medium that slows the bullet without deforming it. Common media include:
*   A tank of water (most common).
*   A box filled with cotton waste.
*   Oiled sawdust.
*   Blocks of ice.

#### **Step 3: Comparison**
The **Crime Bullet** and the **Test Bullet** are placed side-by-side under a [[Comparison Microscope]].
*   This device consists of two microscopes joined by an optical bridge.
*   The expert rotates the bullets to align the **striations**.
*   If the patterns of fine lines (secondary markings) match continuously across the dividing line of the microscope, it confirms that both bullets were fired from the same gun.

### **4. Medicolegal Importance**

1.  **Positive Identification:** It is the only method to conclusively prove that a particular bullet was fired from a particular gun.
2.  **Linking Crimes:** Can link a suspect or a weapon to a specific crime scene.
3.  **Exclusion:** Can prove that a suspect's gun was *not* the murder weapon.
4.  **Multiple Shooters:** In cases involving multiple firearms (e.g., dacoity or police encounters), it determines which specific weapon fired the fatal shot.

### **5. Limitations**

*   **Deformed Bullets:** If the bullet is severely mushroomed or fragmented (e.g., hitting bone), striations may be lost.
*   **Smooth Bore Weapons:** Shotguns do not have rifling; therefore, pellets cannot be traced back to a specific gun using this method (unless it is a rifled slug).
*   **Barrel Changes:** If the inside of the barrel is deliberately altered (filed) or changed significantly by rust between the crime and the test firing, the markings may change.

### **6. Autopsy & Evidence Collection Guidelines**

*   **Don't Wash:** Do not wash the recovered bullet; it may contain trace evidence like tissue, fabric, or paint.
*   **Chain of Custody:** Proper labeling and sealing are crucial. The label should indicate the anatomical location from where the bullet was recovered.
*   **X-Ray:** Always take an X-ray before autopsy to locate the bullet and avoid accidental damage by surgical instruments.
