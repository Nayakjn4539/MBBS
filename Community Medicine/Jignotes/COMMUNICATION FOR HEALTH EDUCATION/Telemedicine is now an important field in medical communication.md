# [[COMMUNICATION FOR HEALTH EDUCATION]] > Telemedicine is now an important field in medical communication

### **Telemedicine in Medical Communication**

**Definition (WHO)**
[[Telemedicine]] is defined as the delivery of health care services, where distance is a critical factor, by all health care professionals using information and communication technologies for the exchange of valid information for:
*   Diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease and injuries.
*   Research and evaluation.
*   Continuing education of health care providers.
All in the interest of advancing the health of individuals and their communities.

### **Main Aims and Objectives**
The primary goals of implementing telemedicine are:
*   **Low Cost Solutions:** Providing affordable healthcare options.
*   **Patient Information Management:** Efficient handling of patient data.
*   **Services to Large Populations:** Reaching mass populations effectively.
*   **Knowledge Based Systems:** Development of systems to support medical decision-making.

### **Public Health Importance**
Telemedicine bridges the gap between patients and providers, especially in resource-poor settings.
1.  **Remote Access:** Provides easy access to medical specialists for people in remote, rural, or underserved areas.
2.  **Cost and Time Reduction:** Reduces transportation time and costs for patients who would otherwise travel long distances.
3.  **Home Based Care:** Facilitates home-based monitoring and care for chronic patients.
4.  **Critical Care Monitoring:** Allows experts to monitor critical patients from a distance.
5.  **Provider Liaison:** Promotes liaison and communication among healthcare providers.
6.  **Public Awareness:** Can be used as a tool for general health awareness and education.
7.  **Knowledge Sharing:** Acts as a platform for sharing medical knowledge and continuing medical education (CME).

### **Types of Technology Used**
Telemedicine utilizes various technologies to facilitate communication:
*   **Store and Forward:** Capturing digital images (e.g., X-rays, pathology slides, skin lesions) and transmitting them to a specialist for later assessment.
*   **Two-way Interactive Television:** Real-time video conferencing between the patient/provider and the specialist.

### **Challenges to Telemedicine**
Despite its potential, several barriers hinder widespread implementation:
*   **Unfamiliarity:** Lack of familiarity among the medical fraternity.
*   **Non-acceptance:** Resistance to change from traditional face-to-face methods.
*   **Technophobia:** Fear or dislike of advanced technology among older practitioners or patients.
*   **High Initial Investment:** High costs for setting up infrastructure and equipment.
*   **Inadequate Infrastructure:** Lack of reliable internet connectivity or technology support in remote areas.
*   **Staff Training:** Requires specialized training for staff to operate systems.
*   **Medico-legal Concerns:** Issues regarding jurisdiction, privacy, and liability.
