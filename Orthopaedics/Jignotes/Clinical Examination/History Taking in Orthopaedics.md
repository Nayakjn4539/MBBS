# [[Clinical Examination]] > History Taking in Orthopaedics

# History Taking in Orthopaedics (Model Case Proforma)

In orthopaedics, the diagnosis begins the moment the patient enters the room. However, a systematic history is the cornerstone of clinical practice. As the surgeon-philosopher Wilfred Trotter stated, *"Disease reveals itself in casual parentheses"*. The patient tells a "story" (often disorganized); it is the clinician's job to construct a "history" (systematic and chronological).

## 1. Bio-Data (Demographics)
Recording accurate demographic data is crucial as many orthopedic conditions have specific age and sex predilections.

*   **Name:** For identification and building rapport.
*   **Age:**
    *   **Infants/Children:** [[Congenital Talipes Equinovarus]] (Clubfoot), [[Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip]], [[Rickets]], [[Poliomyelitis]], [[Perthes’ Disease]].
    *   **Adolescents:** [[Osteosarcoma]], [[Ewing’s Sarcoma]], [[Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis]].
    *   **Young Adults:** [[Giant Cell Tumor]], [[Ankylosing Spondylitis]].
    *   **Elderly:** [[Osteoarthritis]], [[Osteoporosis]], [[Metastatic Bone Disease]], [[Multiple Myeloma]].
*   **Sex:**
    *   **Females:** [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]], [[Osteoporosis]], [[Carpal Tunnel Syndrome]].
    *   **Males:** [[Ankylosing Spondylitis]], [[Disc Prolapse]] (due to heavy labor).
*   **Occupation:**
    *   Sedentary (Back pain).
    *   Manual laborer (Trauma, Degenerative spine).
    *   Computer professionals ([[Repetitive Stress Injury]]).
*   **Dominance:** Right or left-handed (Crucial for upper limb injuries/disabilities).

## 2. Chief Complaints
List the symptoms in **chronological order** of their appearance. Common orthopedic complaints include,:
*   Pain
*   Swelling/Lump
*   Deformity
*   Stiffness/Loss of movement
*   Limp/Difficulty in walking
*   Instability ("Giving way")
*   Neurological symptoms (Weakness, Numbness)

## 3. History of Presenting Illness (HOPI)
This is the elaboration of the chief complaints.

### A. History of Trauma (If applicable)
If the condition is traumatic, detailed interrogation about the **mechanism of injury** is vital:
*   **Mode of Injury:**
    *   Fall from height (calcaneal fractures, spine compression).
    *   Road Traffic Accident (High velocity = comminuted fractures, visceral injuries).
    *   Twisting injury (Ligament tears, [[Meniscal Injury]]).
*   **Time since injury:** Critical for management of [[Open Fracture]] (Golden period < 6 hours).
*   **Treatment received:** First aid, splinting, massage (can cause [[Myositis Ossificans]]).

### B. Pain Analysis
Pain is the most common symptom. Use the mnemonic **SOCRATES** or **ODDPARA**.

| Parameter | Description & Clinical Implication |
| :--- | :--- |
| **O**nset | **Acute:** Trauma, Infection, [[Gout]]. <br> **Insidious:** Tumors, Tuberculosis, [[Osteoarthritis]]. |
| **D**uration | Acute (< 6 weeks), Sub-acute, or Chronic (> 3 months). |
| **D**istribution/Site | Ask the patient to point with one finger ("Point Sign"). <br> *Note:* Hip pathology often presents as **knee pain** (referred pain),. |
| **P**rogression | **Progressive:** Malignancy, Infection. <br> **Intermittent:** Mechanical derangement. |
| **A**ggravating Factors | **Movement/Weight bearing:** Fracture, Arthritis, unstable joints. <br> **Coughing/Sneezing:** Increases intrathecal pressure ([[Intervertebral Disc Prolapse]]). |
| **R**elieving Factors | **Rest:** Relieves mechanical pain. <br> **Aspirin:** Relieves pain in [[Osteoid Osteoma]] (Night pain). |
| **A**ssociated Symptoms | Fever (Infection), Weight loss (Malignancy/TB), Morning stiffness ([[Rheumatoid Arthritis]]). |

**Nature of Pain:**
*   **Rest Pain/Night Pain:** Red flag for **Infection** or **Malignancy**.
*   **Radicular Pain:** Current-like shock radiating to limbs (Root compression).
*   **Start-up Pain:** Pain on starting movement after rest (Osteoarthritis).
*   **Claudication:** Pain in calves on walking, relieved by rest (Vascular vs. [[Spinal Stenosis]]).

### C. Swelling
*   **Duration:** Rapid (Haemarthrosis), Slow (Synovial effusion/Tumor).
*   **Association:** With trauma (immediate = blood; delayed = synovial fluid).
*   **Progression:** Rapid growth suggests malignancy or acute infection.
*   **Pain:** Painful (Inflammatory/Infective); Painless (Benign tumors/Charcot's joint).

### D. Deformity
*   **Onset:** Congenital (since birth) vs. Acquired (post-trauma/disease).
*   **Progression:** Static or progressive.
*   **Associated impairment:** Does it limit footwear or function?

### E. Stiffness / Loss of Motion
*   **Morning Stiffness:** Characteristic of [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]] (usually > 30 mins) and [[Ankylosing Spondylitis]].
*   **Post-traumatic:** Due to adhesions or intra-articular fractures.
*   **Locking:** The joint gets stuck in a position (Loose bodies, [[Meniscal Tear]]).

### F. Instability / Giving Way
*   Common in the knee and ankle.
*   Indicates ligamentous incompetence (e.g., [[Anterior Cruciate Ligament]] tear) or subluxation of the patella.

### G. Neurological Symptoms
*   **Parethesia:** Pins and needles (Nerve compression).
*   **Weakness:** Motor deficit (e.g., Foot drop).
*   **Bowel/Bladder involvement:** **Red Flag** for [[Cauda Equina Syndrome]] or high-grade spinal cord injury.

## 4. Past History
*   **Tuberculosis:** History of pulmonary TB or contact with TB patients ([[Skeletal Tuberculosis]]).
*   **Trauma:** Previous fractures or surgeries.
*   **Medical Comorbidities:**
    *   **Diabetes:** Prone to infections, [[Adhesive Capsulitis]], Charcot joints.
    *   **Hypertension:** Surgical risk.
    *   **Bleeding disorders:** Hemophilia (Haemarthrosis).
*   **Malignancy:** History of breast, prostate, thyroid, lung, or kidney cancer (Sources of bone metastasis).

## 5. Personal History
*   **Diet:** Vegetarian/Non-vegetarian (Assessment of Calcium/Vitamin D intake).
*   **Habits:**
    *   **Smoking:** Associated with delayed union of fractures, disc degeneration, and wound complications.
    *   **Alcohol:** Risk of [[Avascular Necrosis]] of the femoral head, falls/trauma.
*   **Socioeconomic Status:** Relevant for hygiene (infections), nutrition, and affording treatment (implants).

## 6. Family History
*   **Genetic disorders:** [[Hemophilia]], [[Osteogenesis Imperfecta]], [[Skeletal Dysplasias]].
*   **Infections:** Tuberculosis contacts.
*   **Autoimmune:** Rheumatoid arthritis, Seronegative spondyloarthropathies.

## 7. Drug and Allergy History
*   **Steroid use:** Long-term use causes Osteoporosis and AVN.
*   **Anticoagulants:** Relevant for surgical planning.
*   **Drug Allergies:** Specifically to antibiotics or analgesics.
