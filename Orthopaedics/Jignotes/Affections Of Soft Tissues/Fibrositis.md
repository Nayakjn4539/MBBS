# Fibrositis

### Definition
[[Fibrositis]] is a **non-specific condition** characterized by pain in certain muscles, accompanied by tenderness when the affected muscles are gripped. It is essentially a **localized disorder**, distinct from generalized conditions like [[Fibromyalgia]].

### Clinical Features
The condition presents with specific local findings in the soft tissues:
*   **Pain:** The patient complains of pain in specific muscle groups.
*   **Tenderness:** Marked tenderness is elicited when the affected muscle belly is gripped or pressed.
*   **Nodules:** Small, firm, palpable **nodules** are often found within the muscle. These nodules are considered to be [[trigger points]].
*   **Lack of Objective Signs:** Apart from the tenderness and palpable nodules, there are usually no other objective signs (swelling, redness, or radiological changes are absent).

### Common Sites of Involvement
The condition most frequently affects the muscles of the upper back and neck:
*   [[Trapezius muscle]]
*   [[Spinal muscles]] (Paravertebral muscles)

### Differential Diagnosis: Fibrositis vs. Fibromyalgia
It is crucial to differentiate [[Fibrositis]] from [[Fibromyalgia]]. While both involve soft tissue pain, their scope and systemic associations differ significantly.

| Feature | [[Fibrositis]] | [[Fibromyalgia]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Distribution** | **Localized** disorder (specific muscles) | **Widespread/Generalized** disease (affecting both sides, above and below waist) |
| **Duration** | Variable | Lasts more than 3 months |
| **Tender Points** | Localized nodules ([[trigger points]]) | Multiple tender points (at least 11/18 specific sites) |
| **Systemic Symptoms** | Absent | Associated with [[irritable bowel syndrome]], [[headache]], [[dysmenorrhea]], [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] |
| **Etiology** | Non-specific, localized muscular irritation | Proposed to be part of [[fatigue syndrome]] or central sensitization |

### Treatment
The management is primarily conservative and local:
1.  **[[Ultrasonic therapy]]:** Often provides relief from localized pain and muscle tightness.
2.  **[[Local steroid infiltration]]:** Injection of [[hydrocortisone]] into the tender nodules/trigger points can be effective in alleviating symptoms.
3.  **[[Physiotherapy]]:** Local heat and massage may be beneficial.
