# [[COMMUNICATION FOR HEALTH EDUCATION]] > Principles of primary health care with examples

### [[Primary Health Care]] (PHC)

**Definition:**
[[Primary Health Care]] is defined as essential health care made universally accessible to individuals and acceptable to them, through their full participation and at a cost the community and country can afford. It was formally established during the [[Alma-Ata Declaration]] in 1978.

The concept of PHC is based on **Four Pillars** (Principles).

### The Four Principles of Primary Health Care

#### 1. [[Equitable Distribution]]
*   **Concept:** Health services must be shared equally by all people irrespective of their ability to pay, and all (rich or poor, urban or rural) must have access to health services.
*   **Imbalance:** Currently, services are concentrated in cities, but the majority of the population lives in rural areas.
*   **Goal:** To redress this imbalance by shifting the center of gravity of the health care system from cities to rural areas and bringing services as near to people's homes as possible.
*   **Example:**
    *   Establishment of [[Sub-centres]] and [[Primary Health Centres]] (PHCs) in remote, tribal, and rural areas to ensure the "last mile" coverage, rather than just building large tertiary hospitals in metro cities.

#### 2. [[Community Participation]]
*   **Concept:** Individuals, families, and communities must be involved in promoting their own health and welfare. It emphasizes "Health *by* the people" and "placing people's health in people's hands".
*   **Implementation:** Communities should participate in the planning, implementation, and maintenance of health services.
*   **Example:**
    *   **[[ASHA]] (Accredited Social Health Activist):** A local woman selected by the community to act as a health activist and link between the village and the health system.
    *   **[[Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committee]] (VHSNC):** Local bodies deciding how to use untied funds for village health sanitation.

#### 3. [[Intersectoral Coordination]]
*   **Concept:** Health care cannot be provided by the health sector alone. It requires the joint effort of all related sectors contributing to human development.
*   **Involved Sectors:** Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Food, Industry, Education, Housing, Public Works, and Communication.
*   **Example:**
    *   **[[Mid-day Meal Scheme]]:** A coordination between the Education Department and Health Department to improve nutritional status and school enrollment.
    *   **Mosquito Control:** Coordination between the Public Works Department (drainage) and Health Department to prevent vector-borne diseases.

#### 4. [[Appropriate Technology]]
*   **Concept:** Technology that is scientifically sound, adaptable to local needs, and acceptable to those who apply it and those for whom it is used.
*   **Criteria:** It should be available at a cost the community and country can afford.
*   **Example:**
    *   **[[Oral Rehydration Solution]] (ORS):** Using simple ORS packets or home-made fluids for dehydration instead of expensive IV fluids in mild cases.
    *   **[[Vaccine Vial Monitor]] (VVM):** A simple sticker to check vaccine potency instead of complex laboratory testing.
    *   **Standpipe:** Using a standpipe for water supply instead of individual house connections in resource-poor settings.

### Summary Table: Principles of PHC

| Principle | Core Concept | Practical Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Equitable Distribution]]** | Services for all, regardless of status or geography. | PHCs in tribal areas; Free drugs for BPL patients. |
| **[[Community Participation]]** | Involvement of locals in planning and execution. | [[ASHA]] workers; Dai training. |
| **[[Intersectoral Coordination]]** | Health involves multiple government departments. | Sanitation drives; Agricultural policies for food security. |
| **[[Appropriate Technology]]** | Scientifically sound, low-cost, adaptable methods. | [[ORS]]; [[Breastfeeding]]; [[Growth Charts]]. |

### Mnemonic
**"ICE-A"** (Primary Health Care is as cool as **ICE-A**)

*   **I** - **I**ntersectoral Coordination
*   **C** - **C**ommunity Participation
*   **E** - **E**quitable Distribution
*   **A** - **A**ppropriate Technology

### Clinical Relevance
*   **General Practice:** When treating a patient, a doctor must ensure the treatment is affordable (**Appropriate Technology**) and consider environmental factors like water and sanitation (**Intersectoral Coordination**),.
*   **Health Planning:** Administrators must ensure resources reach the poorest segments (**Equitable Distribution**) and involve local leaders in health campaigns (**Community Participation**) to ensure program success,.
