### Important Inorganic Chemicals in Groundwater of West Bengal

The groundwater in West Bengal is frequently contaminated with several inorganic chemicals of public health importance. The most significant among them are:

1.  **[[Arsenic]]**: The most critical public health challenge in the Gangetic delta.
2.  **[[Fluoride]]**: Prevalent in certain districts (e.g., Bankura, Purulia, Birbhum).
3.  **[[Iron]]**: Often found in excess, affecting water acceptability.
4.  **[[Nitrates]]**: Usually from agricultural run-off.
5.  **[[Lead]]** and **Cadmium**: Trace contaminants.

### Detailed Description: [[Arsenicosis]] (Arsenic Contamination)

**Arsenic contamination** of groundwater is a major public health crisis in West Bengal. It is primarily geogenic (natural origin) in nature, where arsenic leaches from minerals/ores into the groundwater.

#### 1. Guideline Value
*   **WHO Provisional Guideline:** 0.01 mg/litre.
*   **Permissible Limit (India):** 0.05 mg/litre (in absence of alternate sources).

#### 2. Health Effects
Chronic exposure to arsenic through drinking water leads to a condition known as **[[Arsenicosis]]**. The toxicity manifests after a long latent period (often years).

*   **Dermatological (Skin) Changes:**
    *   **Melanosis:** Diffuse or spotted pigmentation, often described as "Raindrop pigmentation" on the neck and chest.
    *   **Keratosis:** Hardening and roughening of the skin, typically on the palms (Palmar keratosis) and soles (Plantar keratosis).
*   **Carcinogenicity:**
    *   Arsenic is a known carcinogen (Group A).
    *   Long-term exposure is associated with **Skin cancer**, **Lung cancer**, and **Bladder cancer**.
*   **Vascular Changes:**
    *   **[[Blackfoot Disease]]**: A peripheral vascular disease leading to gangrene of the lower extremities.
*   **Systemic Effects:**
    *   Liver damage (hepatomegaly), neuropathy, and cardiovascular issues.

#### 3. Control Measures
*   **Substitution (Safe Water Source):**
    *   The most effective measure is to switch to safe drinking water sources.
    *   Use of **surface water** (ponds, rivers) after proper treatment.
    *   **Rainwater harvesting**: Collecting rain water to avoid groundwater dependence.
*   **Arsenic Removal Technologies:**
    *   Installation of **Arsenic Removal Plants (ARP)** attached to hand pumps or tube wells.
    *   Domestic filters using specific resins or adsorption media.
*   **Deep Tube Wells:** Sinking tube wells to deeper aquifers (often below 150-200 meters) which are usually free from arsenic.
*   **Nutritional Intervention:** Encouraging a protein-rich diet to help the body excrete arsenic and mitigate toxicity.

#### 4. Clinical Relevance: Mnemonic
To remember the features of Chronic Arsenic Poisoning: **"RAINS"**

*   **R** - **R**aindrop pigmentation (Melanosis)
*   **A** - **A**rsenicosis (Keratosis of palms/soles)
*   **I** - **I**norganic poison (Groundwater source)
*   **N** - **N**eoplasm (Skin, Lung, Bladder cancers)
*   **S** - **S**ystemic issues (Blackfoot disease, Liver damage)
