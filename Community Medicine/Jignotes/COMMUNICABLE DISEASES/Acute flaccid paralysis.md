# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Acute flaccid paralysis

### **Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP)**

**Definition**
[[Acute Flaccid Paralysis]] (AFP) is defined as the **sudden onset** of weakness and floppiness in any part of the body in a **child < 15 years of age**, OR paralysis in a person of **any age** in whom polio is suspected.

**Key Components of the Definition**
*   **Acute:** Rapid progression of paralysis from onset to maximum severity (usually within 4 weeks).
*   **Flaccid:** Loss of muscle tone, described as "floppy" (hypotonia), as opposed to spastic or rigid.
*   **Paralysis:** Weakness or loss of voluntary movement.

**Common Causes (Differential Diagnosis)**
While AFP surveillance is primarily driven by the goal of **[[Polio Eradication]]**, most cases are non-polio. The common causes include:
1.  **Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS):** Often characterized by cytological-albumin dissociation in CSF.
2.  **Transverse Myelitis:** Associated with sensory loss and bladder dysfunction.
3.  **Traumatic Neuritis:** Often caused by intramuscular injections; typically involves only one leg.
4.  **Other Enteroviruses:** Coxsackie-B, ECHO virus, Enterovirus 70 and 71.
5.  **Toxins:** Snake bite, organophosphates, heavy metals.
6.  **Tumors:** Compressing the spinal cord.

**AFP Surveillance**
Surveillance is the cornerstone of the [[National Polio Surveillance Project]] (NPSP). The goal is to detect wild poliovirus transmission by screening all AFP cases.

**Steps in AFP Surveillance**
1.  **Case Detection:** All AFP cases must be reported immediately to the District Immunization Officer (DIO).
2.  **Investigation:** All reported cases must be investigated within **48 hours** of notification.
3.  **Stool Specimen Collection (Crucial Step):**
    *   **Frequency:** **2 stool samples** must be collected.
    *   **Interval:** At least **24 hours apart**.
    *   **Timeline:** Within **14 days** of the onset of paralysis (maximum up to 60 days).
    *   **Quantity:** Minimum **8 grams** (size of an adult thumb).
    *   **Transport:** Must be sent in a **[[Reverse Cold Chain]]** (maintained at +2° to +8°C) to a WHO-accredited laboratory within 72 hours.
4.  **Follow-up:** A follow-up visit is conducted **60 days** after the onset of paralysis to check for **residual weakness**. This helps distinguish polio (residual paralysis present) from conditions like GBS (often full recovery).

**Surveillance Indicators**
To ensure the surveillance system is effective, specific targets must be met:
| Indicator | Target | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Non-polio AFP Rate** | > 1 per 100,000 population aged < 15 years | Indicates the sensitivity of the surveillance system. If the rate is lower, the system is likely missing cases. |
| **Adequate Stool Sample Rate** | > 80% of AFP cases | Ensures high probability of isolating the virus if present. |

**Polio vs. Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS)**
Differentiation is vital during clinical assessment:

| Feature | Poliomyelitis | Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fever** | Present at onset | Usually absent at onset |
| **Paralysis** | Asymmetrical | Symmetrical |
| **Progression** | Rapid (halts after fever subsides) | Ascending paralysis |
| **Sensory Loss** | Absent | Minimal/Subjective |
| **Residual Paralysis** | Common (after 60 days) | Rare (Recovery is common) |

**Mnemonics**
*   **For Stool Collection Criteria:** **"2-2-14"**
    *   **2** samples.
    *   **2**4 hours apart.
    *   Within **14** days of onset.

**Clinical Relevance**
*   **Line Listing:** Every AFP case is line-listed to check for duplication, identify high-risk clusters, and track the progress of the case investigation.
*   **Outbreak Response:** Even a **single case** of wild polio is considered an outbreak. In the vicinity of an AFP case, **Outbreak Response Immunization (ORI)** is conducted where all children < 5 years (approx. 500 households) receive OPV regardless of immunization status.
