# [[Nose]] > Septal Hematoma and Abscess

# Septal Hematoma and Abscess

These two conditions represent acute pathologies of the [[nasal septum]]. While distinct, they are closely related, as a hematoma is often the precursor to an abscess. Both require urgent attention to prevent cosmetic deformity and intracranial complications.

## 1. Septal Hematoma

### Definition
A [[septal hematoma]] is a collection of blood between the [[septal cartilage]] and the overlying [[mucoperichondrium]] (or between the bone and periosteum),.

### Etiology
*   **Trauma (Most Common):**
    *   Nasal trauma, often from frontal blows, sports injuries (e.g., boxing), or road traffic accidents,.
    *   Fracture of the nasal septum.
*   **Iatrogenic:** Following septal surgeries like [[Septoplasty]] or [[Submucous Resection]] (SMR),.
*   **Spontaneous:** Rare; seen in bleeding disorders or blood dyscrasias,.

### Pathogenesis
*   The [[septal cartilage]] gets its nutrition solely from the overlying [[perichondrium]] as it has no intrinsic blood supply.
*   When blood accumulates, it lifts the perichondrium off the cartilage.
*   **Clinical Implication:** This separation deprives the cartilage of its blood supply, leading to ischemic necrosis of the cartilage within **3 days**. The destroyed cartilage is absorbed, leading to structural collapse,.

### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Bilateral Nasal Obstruction:** Usually complete and acute in onset,.
    *   **Frontal Headache:** Sense of heaviness or pressure over the nasal bridge,.
    *   **Pain:** Present but usually less severe than an abscess unless infected.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Inspection:** Smooth, rounded, boggy swelling of the septum visible in both nasal fossae,.
    *   **Palpation:** The mass is soft and **fluctuant**,.
    *   **Differentiation:** Probing helps differentiate it from a [[deviated nasal septum]] (which is hard) and turbinate hypertrophy.

### Management
**Goal:** Evacuate blood immediately to prevent cartilage necrosis and abscess formation,.

1.  **Incision and Drainage (I&D):**
    *   **Small Hematomas:** Can be aspirated with a wide-bore sterile needle,.
    *   **Large Hematomas:** Formal incision is required.
        *   An anteroposterior incision is made parallel to the nasal floor.
        *   A small piece of mucosa is excised from the incision edge to facilitate drainage and prevent premature closure,.
2.  **Nasal Packing:** Bilateral anterior nasal packing is done to apply pressure against the septum, preventing re-accumulation of blood,.
3.  **Quilting Sutures:** Alternatively, quilting sutures can be used to secure the mucoperichondrial flaps,.
4.  **Antibiotics:** Systemic antibiotics are given to prevent secondary infection and abscess formation,.

### Complications
*   **Thickened Septum:** Organization of the hematoma into fibrous tissue,.
*   **Septal Abscess:** If secondary infection occurs.
*   **Saddle Nose Deformity:** Due to necrosis and absorption of the cartilaginous dorsum,.
*   **Septal Perforation:** Due to necrosis of the septal flaps.

## 2. Septal Abscess

### Definition
A [[septal abscess]] is a collection of pus between the mucoperichondrium/mucoperiosteum and the septal cartilage/bone,.

### Etiology
*   **Secondary Infection of Septal Hematoma:** This is the most common cause,.
*   **Furuncle:** Extension from a [[nasal furuncle]] (vestibule) or upper lip,.
*   **Acute Infections:** Rarely follows typhoid, measles, or influenza,.
*   **Trauma:** Accidental or surgical.
*   **Systemic Factors:** Immunocompromised states or [[diabetes mellitus]],.

### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Severe **bilateral nasal obstruction**,.
    *   **Pain and Tenderness:** Severe throbbing pain over the bridge of the nose,.
    *   **Systemic Signs:** High fever, chills, and rigors,.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **External:** Skin over the nose is red, swollen, and tender,.
    *   **Internal:** Bilateral smooth swelling of the septum which is fluctuant. The mucosa appears congested,.
    *   **Lymphadenopathy:** Tender enlargement of [[submandibular lymph nodes]],.

### Management
This is an emergency condition requiring immediate intervention.

1.  **Surgical Drainage:**
    *   Ideally done under general anesthesia (or local).
    *   Incision is made at the most dependent part of the swelling,.
    *   A piece of septal mucosa is excised to allow continuous drainage,.
    *   **Crucial Step:** Necrosed pieces of septal cartilage and pus are removed by suction.
    *   The incision may need to be reopened daily for 2–3 days to ensure full drainage,.
2.  **Antibiotics:** High-dose systemic antibiotics are started immediately (broad-spectrum covering Staph. aureus and anaerobes),. Culture sensitivity of the pus guides specific therapy.
3.  **Nasal Packing:** Loose packing may be placed to prevent re-collection,.

### Complications
Since the veins of this region communicate with the cavernous sinus via the valveless facial veins, complications can be life-threatening.

| **Category** | **Complication** | **Mechanism/Notes** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cosmetic/Structural** | **[[Saddle Nose Deformity]]** | Due to necrosis of septal cartilage (supratip depression). Requires augmentation rhinoplasty later,. |
| | **Septal Perforation** | Necrosis of mucosal flaps,. |
| **Intracranial** | **[[Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis]]** | Spread via valveless veins from the "danger area of the face",. |
| | **Meningitis** | Spread of infection to meninges,. |
| | **Brain Abscess** | Rarely. |
| **Local** | **Facial Cellulitis** | Spread to soft tissues of the upper lip and face,. |
