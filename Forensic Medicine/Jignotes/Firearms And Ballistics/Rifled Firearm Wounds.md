# [[Firearms And Ballistics]] > Rifled Firearm Wounds

### Rifled Firearm Wounds

**Rifled firearms** (pistols, revolvers, and rifles) possess spiral grooves cut into the inner surface of the barrel known as [[rifling]]. These grooves impart a spinning motion to the bullet, ensuring gyroscopic stability and aerodynamic accuracy. The wounds produced differ significantly from smooth-bore (shotgun) wounds and depend heavily on the range of firing.

### I. Mechanics of Wounding
When a rifled bullet hits the body, it causes injury through:
1.  **Laceration and Crushing:** The bullet drills through tissue like a drill bit.
2.  **Shock Wave:** High-velocity missiles generate shock waves causing tissue compression.
3.  **Cavitation:**
    *   **Permanent Cavity:** The actual track made by the bullet.
    *   **Temporary Cavity:** Radial stretching of tissue due to kinetic energy transfer, causing damage well beyond the immediate track.

### II. Characteristics of Entry Wounds (In-Shoot Wounds)
The appearance of the entrance wound is the most critical factor in determining the **range of fire**.

#### 1. General Features (Distant Shot)
When the weapon is fired from a distance beyond the range of powder deposition (usually > 1 meter), the wound presents as:
*   **Shape:** Circular (if perpendicular impact) or Oval (if oblique impact).
*   **Size:** Generally slightly smaller than the bullet diameter due to skin elasticity.
*   **Margins:** **Inverted** (turned inwards).
*   **[[Abrasion Collar]] (Abrasion Ring):** A reddish-brown rim of abraded skin surrounding the defect. Created by the friction of the spinning bullet against the skin indentation before perforation.
*   **[[Grease Collar]] (Dirt Ring/Bullet Wipe):** A dark, blackish ring found on the inner edge of the abrasion collar. It consists of grease, lubricant, or lead wiped off the bullet surface.

#### 2. Range of Fire Classifications
The presence of discharge products (Flame, Smoke, Unburnt Powder) alters the wound appearance.

| Range | Distance (Approx) | Features on Skin | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Contact (Tight/Hard)** | Muzzle pressed to skin | **Stellate/Cruciate shape** (esp. over bone), **Muzzle Impression**, **Cherry-red** track (CO absorption) | Gas expansion under skin causes explosion-like tearing. |
| **Contact (Loose)** | Muzzle near skin | Circular wound, **Singeing** of hair, **Soot** deposition around edges. | Gases escape through the small gap. |
| **Close Range (Point Blank)**| Within flame reach (< 8-15 cm) | **Singeing** (Burning), **Blackening** (Soot/Smoke), **Tattooing** (Powder). | Flame burns hair/skin; Smoke deposits soot. |
| **Near/Intermediate** | 15 cm to ~60-100 cm | **Tattooing/Stippling** (Ante-mortem reaction). **No Singeing or Blackening.** | Unburnt powder grains embed in skin. |
| **Distant** | > 1 meter | **Clean hole**, Abrasion collar, Grease collar. No powder effects. | Only the bullet reaches the target. |

> **Mnemonic for Range Effects:**
> **F**ire **B**urns (Flame $\rightarrow$ Singeing/Burning)
> **S**moke **B**lackens (Smoke $\rightarrow$ Blackening/Smudging)
> **P**owder **T**attoos (Unburnt Powder $\rightarrow$ Tattooing/Stippling)

#### 3. Specific Terms Defined
*   **[[Singeing]] (Burning):** Effect of flame. Hair is curled/clubbed. Skin looks burnt.
*   **[[Blackening]] (Smudging/Fouling):** Deposition of smoke/carbon. **Can be wiped off** with a wet cloth.
*   **[[Tattooing]] (Stippling/Peppering):** Unburnt/partially burnt powder granules embedded into the dermis. They act like mini-missiles causing punctate abrasions. **Cannot be wiped off**.

### III. Characteristics of Exit Wounds (Out-Shoot Wounds)
Exit wounds occur when the bullet passes through the body.
*   **Size:** Usually larger and more irregular/ragged than entry wounds (due to bullet deformation or tumbling).
*   **Margins:** **Everted** (turned outwards).
*   **Absence of:** Abrasion collar, Grease collar, Singeing, Blackening, or Tattooing.
*   **[[Shored Exit Wound]]:** An exception where the exit wound has an abrasion collar. This occurs if the skin at the exit site is supported by a hard surface (wall, floor) or tight clothing (belt, bra strap), causing the skin to be crushed between the exiting bullet and the support.

#### Table: Differences between Entry and Exit Wounds
| Feature | Entry Wound (Rifled) | Exit Wound (Rifled) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Edges** | Inverted | Everted |
| **Size** | Smaller than bullet (usually) | Larger/Irregular |
| **Abrasion Collar** | Present | Absent (except Shored) |
| **Grease Collar** | Present | Absent |
| **Powder Marks** | Present (in close range) | Absent |
| **Bleeding** | Less | More |

### IV. Firearm Wounds on the Skull (Bone Ballistics)
The skull reacts like a brittle substance, aiding in direction determination.

1.  **Entry Wound:**
    *   **Outer Table:** Clean, punched-out hole.
    *   **Inner Table:** Beveling/crater effect (Internal Beveling). The hole on the inside is larger than the outside.
2.  **Exit Wound:**
    *   **Inner Table:** Clean hole.
    *   **Outer Table:** Beveling/crater effect (External Beveling). The hole on the outside is larger.
3.  **[[Keyhole Defect]]:** Produced when a bullet strikes the skull tangentially. The defect shows characteristics of both entry (clean edge) and exit (beveled edge) in a single keyhole shape.
4.  **[[Puppe's Rule]]:** Used to determine the sequence of shots. Fracture lines from a second shot will stop when they meet the fracture lines from the first shot.

### V. Atypical Bullet Wounds
*   **Ricochet Bullet:** A bullet that rebounds off a hard surface before hitting the victim. Causes a large, irregular, tumbling entry wound. No abrasion collar.
*   **Yawing/Tumbling:** Bullet rotates end-over-end, creating a large, keyhole-like entry wound even at a distance.
*   **Kennedy Phenomenon:** Surgical alteration of a gunshot wound (e.g., suturing, extending for drainage) making forensic interpretation difficult.
*   **Intermediary Target:** Bullet passes through an object (door, glass, arm) before hitting the body. The primary target filters out soot/powder; the entry wound may look atypical or contain debris from the intermediate object.

### VI. Autopsy Findings & Procedure
1.  **X-Rays:** **Mandatory** before dissection to locate the bullet, fragments, or "lead snowstorm" (indicates high velocity/fragmenting bullet).
2.  **Clothing:** Examine for powder residue, bullet holes, and direction of fibers. **Do not cut through holes**.
3.  **Skin Excision:** While dissecting, excise the wound of entry with a margin of skin for histopathology (to detect powder residues).
4.  **Bullet Recovery:** Remove with fingers or rubber-tipped forceps to avoid scratching rifling marks (which are crucial for ballistic matching). Mark the base of the bullet for identification.
5.  **Viscera:** Preserve blood for carbon monoxide analysis (in contact shots) and alcohol/drugs.

### VII. Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Nature of Death:**
    *   **Suicidal:** Usually contact/close range. Common sites: Temple, center of forehead, roof of mouth, left chest. Weapon usually found at scene (cadaveric spasm may hold it).
    *   **Homicidal:** Any range. Multiple shots. Inaccessible sites (back of head). No weapon at scene.
    *   **Accidental:** Cleaning firearms, hunting accidents.
*   **Identification of Weapon:** By [[Rifling]] marks (lands and grooves) on the recovered bullet (Ballistic Fingerprinting).
*   **Range and Direction:** Determined by collars, beveling, and powder residue patterns.
