# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Criteria for surveillance as per the International Health regulations 2005

### **Criteria for Surveillance under International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005**

The **[[International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005]]** represent a binding international legal agreement involving 196 countries, including all WHO Member States. The primary goal is to prevent, protect against, control, and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade.

Unlike the previous regulations (IHR 1969), which covered only three diseases (Cholera, Plague, Yellow Fever), the **[[IHR 2005]]** have broadened the scope to cover **any public health event** (biological, chemical, or radionuclear) that may constitute a **[[Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)]]**.

---

### **1. Mandatory Notification (Always Notifiable)**
Four diseases are considered sufficiently serious that a single case constitutes a potential **PHEIC** and must be **automatically notified** to the WHO immediately.

*   **[[Smallpox]]**
*   **[[Orthopaedics/Jignotes/Pediatric Orthopaedics/Poliomyelitis]]** due to wild-type poliovirus
*   **[[Human Influenza]]** caused by a new subtype (e.g., pandemic potential strains)
*   **[[SARS]]** (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)

> **Mnemonic: SIPS**
> *   **S**mallpox
> *   **I**nfluenza (Human, new subtype)
> *   **P**olio (Wild)
> *   **S**ARS

### **2. The Decision Instrument (The 4 Criteria)**
For other public health events (biological, chemical, or radionuclear), States Parties must use a **Decision Instrument** (Annex 2 of IHR 2005) to assess whether an event requires notification. An event is notifiable if it meets **at least two** of the following four criteria:

1.  **Is the public health impact of the event serious?** (e.g., high morbidity/mortality, potential for fast spread).
2.  **Is the event unusual or unexpected?** (e.g., disease unknown in the area or caused by unknown agent).
3.  **Is there a significant risk of international spread?** (e.g., cross-border movement, evidence of spread to other countries).
4.  **Is there a significant risk of international travel or trade restrictions?** (e.g., trade bans, flight cancellations).

> **Mnemonic: SUIT**
> *   **S**pread (International)
> *   **U**nusual/Unexpected
> *   **I**mpact (Serious public health impact)
> *   **T**rade/Travel restrictions

### **3. Specific Diseases Requiring Assessment**
Certain diseases are specifically listed in the IHR (2005) to be assessed using the above **Decision Instrument** because they have demonstrated the ability to cause serious public health impact and spread internationally. These include:

*   **[[Cholera]]**
*   **[[Pneumonic Plague]]**
*   **[[Yellow Fever]]**
*   **[[Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers]]** (e.g., Ebola, Lassa, Marburg)
*   **[[West Nile Fever]]**
*   Other diseases of regional concern (e.g., Dengue, Rift Valley Fever, Meningococcal disease)

*(Note: Under IHR 1969, Cholera, Plague, and Yellow Fever were automatically notifiable. Under IHR 2005, they are subject to assessment using the 4 criteria).*

### **4. Reporting and Verification**
*   **Notification:** States must notify WHO of all events which may constitute a PHEIC within **24 hours** of assessment.
*   **National Focal Point (NFP):** Each country must designate a National IHR Focal Point available 24/7 to communicate with WHO IHR Contact Points.
*   **Core Capacities:** Countries are required to develop core public health capacities for surveillance, reporting, notification, verification, response, and collaboration activities.
