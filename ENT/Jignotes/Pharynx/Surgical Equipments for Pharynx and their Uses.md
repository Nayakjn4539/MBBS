# Surgical Equipments for Pharynx and their Uses

## 1. Mouth Gags and Stabilization
These instruments are essential for exposing the oropharynx and nasopharynx, particularly during [[Adenotonsillectomy]] and palatal surgeries.

### [[Boyle-Davis Mouth Gag]]
*   **Structure:** Consists of a frame (Davis gag) that holds the mouth open and a detachable tongue blade (Boyle) available in various sizes.
*   **Mechanism:** It is inserted closed, then opened using a ratchet mechanism to keep the jaws apart. The tongue blade retracts the tongue anteriorly and inferiorly.
*   **Uses:**
    *   [[Tonsillectomy]] and [[Adenoidectomy]].
    *   [[Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty]] (UPPP).
    *   Repair of [[Cleft Palate]].
    *   Excision of [[Angiofibroma]] or [[Antrochoanal Polyp]].
*   **Clinical Implication:** Special tongue blades (e.g., Russell-Davis) have a groove to accommodate and protect the endotracheal tube. Care must be taken to avoid injury to lips and teeth during insertion.

### [[Draffin’s Bipod Stand]]
*   **Structure:** Consists of two metallic rods (pods) with rings. These rods are assembled to suspend the handle of the Boyle-Davis mouth gag.
*   **Stabilization:** The lower ends of the pods rest on a **Magauran’s plate** (a flat metal plate with depressions) placed on the patient's chest.
*   **Uses:** Supports the mouth gag in a fixed position, freeing the surgeon's hands.
*   **Clinical Implication:** Used in [[Rose Position]] (extension of neck) for tonsillectomy but care must be taken during adenoidectomy to avoid excessive extension at the atlanto-occipital joint.

### [[Doyen’s Mouth Gag]]
*   **Structure:** A self-retaining gag with curved blades that fit over the molar teeth.
*   **Uses:**
    *   Intraoral surgeries (e.g., [[Glossectomy]], floor of mouth cyst removal).
    *   Used when tongue retraction is *not* desired (unlike Boyle-Davis).
    *   Oral toilet in unconscious patients.
*   **Contraindication:** Edentulous patients (requires teeth for grip).

### [[Jenning’s Mouth Gag]]
*   **Structure:** Applied in the center of the mouth; fits over alveolar margins.
*   **Advantage:** Can be used in edentulous patients.

## 2. Tonsillectomy Instruments
This set is specific to the "Cold Steel" dissection method.

### [[Denis Browne Tonsil Holding Forceps]]
*   **Structure:** Long forceps with a box joint and an angled shaft (prevents obstruction of vision). The tip has fenestrated, cup-shaped jaws (upper jaw fits into the lower).
*   **Uses:** To grasp the tonsil and pull it medially during dissection.
*   **Clinical Implication:** Designed to hold tissue firmly without tearing (unlike Luc's forceps which has sharper edges).

### [[Tonsil Knife]] (Sickle Knife / Abraham Knife)
*   **Structure:** Sickle-shaped sharp blade.
*   **Uses:** Making the initial mucosal incision at the upper pole of the tonsil and anterior pillar.

### [[Tonsil Dissector]] and Anterior Pillar Retractor
*   **Types:** [[Mollison’s Tonsil Dissector]], Gwynne Evan's, Hurd.
*   **Structure:** Double-ended instrument.
    *   *Dissector end:* Blunt end (serrated or smooth) to separate the tonsil capsule from the superior constrictor muscle.
    *   *Retractor end:* Curved/C-shaped end to retract the anterior pillar.
*   **Uses:**
    *   Blunt dissection of the tonsil.
    *   Visualizing bleeding points in the fossa.
    *   inspecting for tonsillar remnants.

### [[Tonsil Scissors]]
*   **Structure:** Long scissors with slightly bent, blunt tips.
*   **Uses:** Sharp dissection of the tonsil, cutting ligatures, and release of tongue tie.

### [[Eve’s Tonsillar Snare]]
*   **Structure:** A hollow tube with a wire loop at the end, operated by a sliding handle.
*   **Mechanism:** The loop is threaded over the tonsil to the pedicle (lower pole). Tightening the snare crushes the tissues before cutting.
*   **Uses:** Amputation of the tonsil pedicle.
*   **Clinical Implication:** The crushing action releases tissue **thromboplastin**, which aids in hemostasis (minimizing bleeding) compared to sharp cutting.

### [[Tonsil Artery Forceps]]
*   **Burkitt’s Forceps (Straight):** Long and slender; used to initially catch bleeding points in the deep fossa.
*   **Negus Artery Forceps (Curved):** Has a sharply curved tip. Used as a **replacement forceps** to clamp the vessel previously held by the straight forceps. The curve allows a ligature to be slipped over it easily.
*   **Wilson’s Artery Forceps:** Angulated in the middle; functions similar to Negus.

### [[Negus Knot Tier]] (Ligature Slipper)
*   **Structure:** An instrument with a blunt forked end (pusher).
*   **Uses:** Used to push/slip the ligature knot deep into the tonsillar fossa to tie off vessels clamped by the curved artery forceps.

### [[Yankauer Suction Tube]]
*   **Structure:** Long suction cannula with a large handle and a bulbous/covered tip.
*   **Uses:** Suctioning blood and secretions during oral/pharyngeal surgeries. The tip design prevents damage to the pharyngeal mucosa.

## 3. Adenoidectomy Instruments

### [[St. Clair Thomson Adenoid Curette]]
*   **Structure:** A dagger-like instrument with a sharp rectangular/curved blade.
    *   **With Cage (Guard):** The cage traps the shaved adenoid tissue, preventing aspiration into the larynx.
    *   **Without Cage:** Used to remove lateral lymphoid bands or tags.
*   **Uses:** Removal of adenoid mass (curettage).
*   **Clinical Implication:**
    *   The curette without a cage is ideal for lateral masses to prevent injury to the [[Eustachian Tube]] orifice.
    *   The head must be slightly flexed (not hyperextended) during the sweeping movement to avoid injury to the odontoid process/C1-C2 vertebrae.

### [[La Force Adenotome]]
*   **Structure:** Box-like instrument with a guillotine blade.
*   **Uses:** Alternative to the curette; captures tissue within the box.

### [[Microdebrider]]
*   **Mechanism:** Powered rotary shaving device with continuous suction.
*   **Uses:** Endoscopic adenoidectomy and intracapsular tonsillectomy.
*   **Advantage:** Precise removal under vision, reduced collateral damage.

### [[Coblation Wand]]
*   **Mechanism:** Uses radiofrequency energy in a saline medium to create a plasma field that dissolves tissue at low temperatures (40-70°C).
*   **Uses:** "Hot" tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy.
*   **Advantage:** Minimal thermal spread, simultaneous hemostasis.

## 4. Abscess Drainage Instruments

### [[Peritonsillar Abscess Forceps]] (Quinsy Forceps)
*   **Structure:** Bayonet-shaped forceps with a sharp pointed tip. Crucially, the tip acts as a **trocar**, but a **shoulder/guard** a few millimeters up prevents deep penetration.
*   **Uses:** Incision and drainage of [[Peritonsillar Abscess]] (Quinsy).
*   **Method:** The closed tip stabs the abscess (incision); the blades are then opened to dilate the track and drain pus (Hilton's method).

## 5. Examination and Retraction Instruments

### [[Lack’s Tongue Depressor]]
*   **Structure:** L-shaped flat metal blade.
*   **Uses:**
    *   Depressing the tongue for oropharyngeal exam.
    *   **Cold Spatula Test:** Assessing nasal patency (misting).
    *   **Posterior Rhinoscopy:** Used to depress the tongue while using a postnasal mirror.

### [[Posterior Rhinoscopy Mirror]] (Postnasal Mirror)
*   **Structure:** Smaller than a laryngeal mirror, shaft may be bayonet-shaped.
*   **Uses:** Visualizing the nasopharynx (adenoids, choanae, Eustachian tube openings).

### [[Indirect Laryngoscopy Mirror]]
*   **Structure:** Angled mirror on a straight shaft.
*   **Uses:** Visualizing the base of tongue, vallecula, and hypopharynx.

### [[Hajek’s Retractor]]
*   **Structure:** S-shaped. One end is right-angled (lip retraction), the other is curved (cheek retraction).
*   **Uses:** Retracting the upper lip during transoral approaches (e.g., Caldwell-Luc, sublabial approaches).

## 6. Endoscopes for Pharynx

### [[Nasopharyngoscope]]
*   **Flexible Fiberoptic:** Passed through the nose to visualize the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and larynx. Allows assessment of velopharyngeal closure and dynamic vocal cord movement.
*   **Rigid (Hopkins Rod):** 0°, 30°, or 70° scopes. Provides high-resolution view of the nasopharynx.

### [[Hypopharyngoscope]]
*   **Structure:** Rigid tube, often with proximal illumination (Negus type) or distal (Jackson type).
*   **Uses:**
    *   Diagnostic: Biopsy of pyriform fossa/post-cricoid lesions.
    *   Therapeutic: Foreign body removal.
