# [[DEMOGRAPHY AND FAMILY PLANNING]] > Acculturation has both merits & demerits

# Acculturation (Culture Contact)

### Definition
**Acculturation** is defined as the phenomenon where there is contact between two people or groups with different types of culture, resulting in the **diffusion of culture** both ways. It is essentially "culture contact".

### Mechanisms of Acculturation
Culture contact and exchange occur through various channels:
1.  **Trade and Commerce**
2.  **Industrialization**
3.  **Propagation of Religion**
4.  **Education**
5.  **Conquest** (e.g., The British influence on Indian culture, leading to the saying "An Indian is said to be the next best Englishman").

### Merits (Positive Impacts on Health)

Acculturation often introduces beneficial practices that improve the **Quality of Life** and health indices.

*   **Introduction of Scientific Medicine:** The shift from relying solely on folklore or supernatural cures to accepting [[Modern Medicine]], vaccination, and institutional deliveries.
*   **Dietary Improvements:** Breakdown of rigid food taboos. For example, some orthodox vegetarians may start consuming eggs or meat, improving protein intake.
*   **Hygiene and Sanitation:** Adoption of better personal hygiene practices, use of soaps, and construction of sanitary latrines due to education and exposure to developed health systems.
*   **Social Reform:** Improvement in the status of women, education of girls, and raising the age of marriage due to exposure to modern social values.

### Demerits (Negative Impacts on Health)

The adoption of a "modern" lifestyle often brings new health hazards, particularly **Non-communicable diseases (NCDs)**.

*   **Lifestyle Diseases:** Widespread use of **tobacco** and **alcohol** is often a result of culture contact. This leads to an increase in [[Coronary Heart Disease]], hypertension, and cancers.
*   **Dietary Hazards:** Shift from traditional, high-fibre diets to refined, high-calorie "western" diets leading to obesity and diabetes.
*   **Mental Health Issues:**
    *   **"Clash of Cultures":** In transitional societies, young people or migrants may face conflict between traditional parental values and modern mass media influences, leading to stress and alienation.
    *   **Breakdown of Support:** Shift from [[Joint Family]] to nuclear families reduces social security for the elderly and increases mental stress.
*   **New Disease Vectors:** Improved transport and trade can introduce exotic diseases or vectors to new areas (e.g., dispersion of *Aedes* mosquitoes).

### Comparison: Impact of Acculturation

| Area of Impact | Merits (Positive Effects) | Demerits (Negative Effects) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Medical Systems** | Acceptance of [[Immunization]], surgery, and antibiotics. | Over-reliance on pills; neglect of holistic/traditional preventive methods. |
| **Nutrition** | Removal of harmful food taboos; better protein intake. | Adoption of fast food, high sugar/salt intake (Junk food culture). |
| **Social Habits** | improved education and hygiene awareness. | Addiction to alcohol, smoking, and drugs; sedentary lifestyle. |
| **Mental Health** | Better awareness of rights and self-expression. | Stress, anxiety, "identity crisis" among migrants, and loss of social cohesion. |

### Clinical & Epidemiological Relevance

*   **Migrant Studies:** Epidemiologists use acculturation to study disease etiology. For example, Japanese people living in Japan have lower rates of **Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)** and colon cancer than those who migrated to the USA. Third-generation Japanese immigrants in the USA have rates similar to Americans, proving that **environmental/cultural factors (lifestyle)** matter more than genetics in these diseases.
*   **Social History:** A doctor must evaluate a patient's degree of acculturation to understand their **dietary habits**, **substance use**, and **health-seeking behavior** (e.g., a rural patient migrating to an urban slum may adopt the worst habits of both worlds).

### Mnemonic
To remember the effects of Acculturation, think of **"TRADE"**:

*   **T** - **T**obacco/Alcohol (Demerit)
*   **R** - **R**eduction in traditional support/Joint family (Demerit)
*   **A** - **A**doption of Scientific Medicine (Merit)
*   **D** - **D**ietary changes (Both Merit & Demerit)
*   **E** - **E**ducation & Hygiene (Merit)
