# [[Surgical Procedures]] > Tendon Transfers

### Definition and Purpose
**[[Tendon transfer]]** is a surgical procedure wherein the insertion of the tendon of a functioning muscle is moved to a new site, so that the muscle henceforth performs a different action. The primary goal is to restore movement or balance to a joint that has lost function due to muscle injury, paralysis, or rupture.

**Indications:**
*   **Peripheral Nerve Injuries:** Irreparable nerve damage (e.g., [[Radial nerve palsy]], [[Ulnar nerve palsy]]).
*   **CNS Disorders:** [[Cerebral palsy]], [[Poliomyelitis]], [[Stroke]].
*   **Tendon Ruptures:** Old ruptures where direct repair is not feasible (e.g., [[Extensor Pollicis Longus]] rupture).
*   **Congenital Defects:** Muscle agenesis.

### Principles of Tendon Transfer
For a tendon transfer to be successful, specific physiological and mechanical prerequisites must be met.

**1. Donor Tendon Selection (The Motor)**
*   **Power:** The donor muscle must have a minimum power of **Grade 4 or 5** (MRC scale). A muscle loses approximately **one grade of power** following transfer.
*   **Expendability:** The removal of the donor tendon must not result in a significant functional deficit at its original site.
*   **Synergy:** Synergistic muscles (muscles that naturally contract together) are preferred as they are easier to rehabilitate (e.g., wrist flexors are synergistic with finger extensors).
*   **Amplitude of Excursion:** The range of movement (excursion) of the donor tendon should match that of the recipient tendon.
*   **Integrity:** The donor muscle must have its own intact nerve and blood supply.

**2. Recipient Site and Pathway**
*   **Supple Joints:** The joints on which the tendon acts must be mobile and supple. Stiffness or contractures must be corrected *before* the transfer.
*   **Straight Line of Pull:** The line of action should be as straight as possible to maximize efficiency.
*   **Subcutaneous Placement:** The route should be superficial (subcutaneous) or through a sheath to prevent adhesions.
*   **Tissue Bed:** There should be no scarring at the bed of the transferred tendon.

**3. Patient Factors**
*   **Age:** Minimum 5 years is generally preferred to ensure cooperation in postoperative rehabilitation.
*   **Disease Status:** The underlying disease should be non-progressive.

> **Clinical Implication:** In [[Volkmann's ischemic contracture]] or severe stiffness, passive range of motion exercises or surgical release (capsulotomy) must precede tendon transfer. A tendon cannot move a stiff joint.

### Common Tendon Transfers by Region

#### 1. Radial Nerve Palsy (Wrist Drop)
The goal is to restore wrist extension, finger extension, and thumb extension.

**Common Transfers (Modified Jones Transfer):**
| Function to Restore | Donor Tendon | Recipient Tendon |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Wrist Extension** | [[Pronator Teres]] (PT) | [[Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis]] (ECRB) |
| **Finger Extension** | [[Flexor Carpi Ulnaris]] (FCU) OR [[Flexor Carpi Radialis]] (FCR) OR [[Flexor Digitorum Superficialis]] (FDS) | [[Extensor Digitorum Communis]] (EDC) |
| **Thumb Extension** | [[Palmaris Longus]] (PL) OR [[Flexor Digitorum Superficialis]] (FDS) | [[Extensor Pollicis Longus]] (EPL) |

> **Mnemonic for Radial Nerve Transfer:** **P-F-P**
> *   **P**ronator Teres $\rightarrow$ Wrist
> *   **F**lexor (FCR/FCU/FDS) $\rightarrow$ Fingers
> *   **P**almaris Longus $\rightarrow$ Thumb (Pollex)

#### 2. Median Nerve Palsy
**Low Lesion (Wrist level):** Loss of opposition (Ape thumb deformity).
*   **Procedure:** **[[Opponens Plasty]]**.
*   **Donor Options:**
    *   [[Flexor Digitorum Superficialis]] (FDS) of the ring finger (Bunnel/Royle-Thompson procedure).
    *   [[Extensor Indicis]] (EI) proprius (Burkhalter transfer).
    *   [[Palmaris Longus]] (PL) (Camitz transfer).
*   **Technique:** The tendon is re-routed (often using the distal FCU or palmar fascia as a pulley) towards the thumb to restore the vector of opposition.

**High Lesion (Elbow level):** Loss of finger flexion (Pointing Index) and opposition.
*   **Transfers:**
    *   FDS of ring/middle finger $\rightarrow$ FDP of index/middle fingers (to restore flexion).
    *   [[Extensor Carpi Radialis Longus]] (ECRL) $\rightarrow$ [[Flexor Digitorum Profundus]] (FDP).

#### 3. Ulnar Nerve Palsy (Claw Hand)
The goal is to prevent hyperextension at the [[Metacarpophalangeal joint]] (MCP) to allow the long extensors to extend the IP joints, or to actively flex the MCP joints (Intrinsic replacement).

**Procedures:**
*   **Brand’s Operation (Many-tailed transfer):** [[Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis]] (ECRB) or [[Flexor Digitorum Superficialis]] (FDS) is extended with a graft (plantaris/fascia lata), split into four tails, and attached to the extensor mechanism of fingers.
*   **Modified Stiles-Bunnell Transfer:** Uses FDS.
*   **Zancolli’s Capsulodesis:** A static procedure to prevent MCP hyperextension (not a dynamic transfer).

#### 4. Common Peroneal Nerve Palsy (Foot Drop)
The goal is to restore ankle dorsiflexion.
*   **Donor:** **[[Tibialis Posterior]]** tendon.
*   **Technique:** The tendon is detached from the navicular, routed through the interosseous membrane to the anterior aspect of the leg, and attached to the [[Lateral Cuneiform]] or the base of the metatarsals.

#### 5. Ruptured Extensor Pollicis Longus (EPL)
Common in [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]] or post-[[Colles' fracture]].
*   **Transfer:** **[[Extensor Indicis]]** (EI) to EPL.

### Surgical Technique Considerations

1.  **Incisions:** Planned to allow straight-line pull and access to both donor and recipient sites.
2.  **Route:** The tendon is often passed through a subcutaneous tunnel. Pulleys may be constructed (as in opponens plasty) to alter the direction of pull.
3.  **Tension:** This is critical.
    *   Too tight = Fixed contracture.
    *   Too loose = Ineffective movement.
    *   The tendon is usually sutured under **moderate tension**.
4.  **Fixation:**
    *   **Tendon-to-Tendon:** End-to-side or weaving technique (Pulvertaft weave).
    *   **Tendon-to-Bone:** Using drill holes, suture anchors, or staples.

### Postoperative Management and Rehabilitation

*   **Immobilization:** The limb is splinted/casted in a position that relieves tension on the suture line (usually for 3–4 weeks).
    *   *Example:* For radial nerve transfer, the wrist and fingers are immobilized in extension.
*   **Mobilization:**
    *   **Phase 1 (3–4 weeks):** Protected passive motion.
    *   **Phase 2:** Active assisted motion. The patient must learn to "fire" the donor muscle to produce the new action (cortical re-education).
    *   **Phase 3:** Strengthening exercises.
