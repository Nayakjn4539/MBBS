# [[Asphyxiant Poisons]] > Hydrogen Sulphide

### Hydrogen Sulphide ($H_2S$)

**Synonyms:** Sewer gas, Stink damp, Dihydrogen monosulfide, Hydrosulfuric acid.,

**Physical Properties:**
*   **State:** Colourless gas.
*   **Odour:** Strong odour of **rotten eggs**.
*   **Density:** Heavier than air (tends to settle in pits, sewers, and tunnels).,
*   **Flammability:** Flammable and explosive.

### Sources of Exposure
1.  **Decomposition:** Produced by the putrefaction of organic matter containing sulfur (sewers, cesspools, septic tanks, privies).
2.  **Industry:** Tannery vats, glue factories, rubber vulcanizing, petroleum refining, viscose rayon manufacture.,
3.  **Chemical Labs:** Prepared by action of acid on iron sulfide.
4.  **Natural:** Volcanoes and sulfur springs.
5.  **Detergent Suicide:** Mixing household chemicals (bath sulfur + toilet bowl cleaner/acid) in enclosed spaces (cars/closets).

### Mechanism of Action
Hydrogen sulphide acts as a **Chemical [[Asphyxiant]]** (Systemic Asphyxiant) and an Irritant.

1.  **Cytochrome Oxidase Inhibition:** It inhibits [[cytochrome oxidase]] (specifically cytochrome $aa_3$) in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This stops cellular respiration and prevents tissues from using oxygen (Histotoxic Hypoxia). This mechanism is identical to [[Cyanide]] poisoning.,
2.  **Irritant Action:** On contact with moisture in the respiratory tract, it forms alkali (sodium sulfide), causing severe irritation, pulmonary edema, and conjunctivitis.
3.  **CNS Depression:** High concentrations cause direct paralysis of the respiratory center.

### Clinical Features
The clinical presentation depends heavily on the concentration of the gas.

**1. Low Concentration (Irritant Phase):**
*   **Eyes:** Intense irritation, lacrimation, photophobia, blepharospasm. A condition known as **"Gas Eye"** (keratoconjunctivitis).
*   **Respiratory:** Cough, rhinorrhea, soreness in throat, chest tightness (bronchitis/pneumonitis).
*   **GIT:** Nausea, vomiting.

**2. High Concentration (Systemic Phase):**
*   **Olfactory Paralysis:** This is a critical danger sign. Initially, the rotten egg smell is strong, but high concentrations rapidly paralyze the olfactory nerves. The victim thinks the gas has dissipated and stops taking precautions.,
*   **CNS:** Headache, dizziness, ataxia, confusion, coma, and convulsions.
*   **Knock-down Effect:** In very high concentrations (>1000 ppm), sudden inhalation causes immediate paralysis of the respiratory center. The victim falls down as if struck by a blow (apoplectic type) and dies almost instantaneously.,

**3. Chronic Poisoning:**
*   Headache, weakness, weight loss, tremors, greenish-gray line on the gums.

### Fatal Dose and Period
*   **Fatal Concentration:** > 500-1000 ppm causes rapid death.
*   **Fatal Period:** Immediate to 30 minutes depending on concentration.

### Diagnosis
1.  **Smell:** Rotten egg odor in breath/clothes (unless olfactory fatigue has set in).
2.  **Lead Acetate Paper Test:** Moistened lead acetate paper turns **black** (Lead Sulfide) when exposed to the gas or breath.
3.  **Silver Coin Test:** Silver coins in the victim's pocket may turn black (Silver Sulfide).

### Treatment
Treatment must be rapid as death occurs quickly. **Rescuers must use self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)** to avoid becoming victims themselves.

**1. Removal:** Move victim to fresh air immediately.
**2. Artificial Respiration:** High flow 100% [[Oxygen]] is crucial.
**3. Antidotes (Nitrites):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Nitrites convert Hemoglobin to [[Methemoglobin]]. H2S has a higher affinity for methemoglobin than for cytochrome oxidase. It leaves the tissues to bind with methemoglobin, forming **Sulfmethemoglobin** (non-toxic), reactivating the enzyme.
    *   **Protocol (Similar to Cyanide Kit):**
        *   **Amyl Nitrite:** Inhalation (perles broken into gauze) for 30 seconds every minute.
        *   **Sodium Nitrite:** 3% solution, 10 ml IV over 3-4 minutes.
    *   *Note:* Unlike Cyanide poisoning, **Sodium Thiosulfate** is NOT strictly necessary because the body can spontaneously detoxify sulfmethemoglobin, though some protocols still include it.
**4. Supportive:** Treat pulmonary edema and acidosis. Hyperbaric oxygen may be beneficial.

### Autopsy Findings
**External Findings:**
*   **Smell:** Offensive rotten egg odor from the body (if fresh).
*   **Color:** [[Hypostasis]] (postmortem staining) produces a **bluish-green** or greenish-purple discoloration.
*   **Eyes:** Congested conjunctiva.
*   **Oral:** Blood-stained froth from mouth/nose (due to pulmonary edema).

**Internal Findings:**
*   **Respiratory:** Mucosa of trachea/bronchi is congested and red. Intense [[pulmonary edema]].
*   **Viscera:** **Greenish discoloration** of the gray matter of the brain, viscera, and bronchial secretions due to the formation of sulfhemoglobin.
*   **Blood:** Dark, fluid, and greenish-purple.

### Medicolegal Aspects
1.  **Accidental:** Most common. Occurs in sewer workers ("Sewer Gas"), tannery workers, and chemical industries.,
2.  **Suicidal:** Increasing trend of "Chemical Suicide" (Detergent suicide) in cars/bathrooms by mixing acid and sulfur sources.
3.  **Homicidal:** Rare.
