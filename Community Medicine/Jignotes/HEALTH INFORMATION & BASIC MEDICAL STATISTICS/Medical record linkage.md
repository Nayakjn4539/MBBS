# [[HEALTH INFORMATION & BASIC MEDICAL STATISTICS]] > Medical record linkage

### Medical Record Linkage

**Definition**
[[Medical record linkage]] is the process of bringing together records relating to one individual (or to one family), where the records originate in different times or places.

**Concept**
*   It implies the **assembly and maintenance** of a file for each individual in a population containing the most important records relating to their health.
*   It essentially creates a cumulative health history for an individual by connecting various data points generated throughout their life.

**Components of the Record**
The events commonly recorded and linked include:
1.  **Vital Events:** [[Birth]], [[Marriage]], and [[Death]].
2.  **Clinical Events:** [[Hospital admission]] and [[discharge]].
3.  **Other Health Data:**
    *   Sickness absence from work.
    *   Prophylactic procedures (e.g., Immunization).
    *   Use of social services.

**Applications and Uses**
Medical record linkage is a valuable tool for epidemiological research. Its primary uses include:
*   **Studying Associations:** It is particularly suitable for studying associations between diseases (multimorbidity), which often have [[aetiological significance]].
*   **Genetic Studies:** Useful for [[Twin studies]] and family/genetic research.
*   **Morbidity Measurement:** Helps in the accurate measurement of [[morbidity]] in a population.
*   **Chronic Disease:** Essential for [[Chronic disease epidemiology]] to track the natural history of long-term conditions.

**Limitations and Feasibility**
While theoretically ideal, there are significant practical hurdles:
*   **Volume of Data:** The main problem is the massive volume of data that can accumulate, making management difficult.
*   **Limited Scale:** In practice, record linkage has been applied only on a limited scale.
*   **Resource Constraints:** Currently, comprehensive record linkage is considered beyond the reach of many [[developing countries]] due to the infrastructure and costs involved.

| :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Goal** | Connect records from different times/places for one person. |
| **Key Data Sources** | Vital statistics (Birth/Death), Hospital records. |
| **Epidemiological Value** | Establishing disease associations and etiology. |
| **Major Obstacle** | Excessive accumulation of data. |

**Mnemonic**
To remember the components and issues of Record Linkage, think **"LINK"**:
*   **L**ongitudinal data (Birth to Death)
*   **I**ndividual focused
*   **N**umerous sources (Hospital, Social, Vital events)
*   **K**eeps accumulating (Volume is a problem)

**Clinical Relevance**
In the era of modern Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) in India, the concept of Medical Record Linkage is the foundation of creating a **Unique Health ID (UHID)**. This allows a doctor to view a patient's entire medical history (past surgeries, drug allergies, chronic conditions) regardless of where previous treatment was received, preventing adverse drug reactions and redundant investigations.
