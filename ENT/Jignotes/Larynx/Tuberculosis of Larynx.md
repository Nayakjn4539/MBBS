# Tuberculosis of Larynx

[[Tuberculosis of Larynx]] (Laryngeal Phthisis) is a chronic granulomatous infection of the larynx caused by [[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]. It is the most common granulomatous disease of the larynx,.

### Etiology and Routes of Infection
*   **Causative Agent:** [[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]].
*   **Association:** It is almost always secondary to active [[pulmonary tuberculosis]],,,. Primary laryngeal tuberculosis is rare (approx. 5%).
*   **Routes of Spread:**
    1.  **Bronchogenic (Most Common):** Sputum laden with bacilli from the lungs comes in contact with the posterior larynx during coughing and accumulation,,.
    2.  **Hematogenous:** Blood-borne spread from distant foci.
    3.  **Lymphatic:** From cervical lymph nodes.
*   **Demographics:** Commonly affects middle-aged males,.

### Pathology
The disease process typically starts in the **posterior part** of the larynx because the infected sputum pools there during recumbency and adheres to the rugose epithelium of the interarytenoid region,,,.

**Sites of Involvement (in decreasing order of frequency),:**
1.  Interarytenoid region (posterior commissure).
2.  Ventricular bands (false vocal cords).
3.  Vocal cords.
4.  Epiglottis.

**Pathological Stages,:**
1.  **Stage of Infiltration (Catarrhal):** Hyperemia, edema, and cellular infiltration.
2.  **Stage of Granuloma:** Formation of submucosal tubercles which may coalesce to form nodules. This causes pseudoedema.
3.  **Stage of Ulceration:** Caseation necrosis leads to superficial, ragged ulcers.
4.  **Stage of Cicatrization:** Healing by fibrosis, potentially leading to [[laryngeal stenosis]] or fixation of the cricoarytenoid joint.

### Clinical Features

#### Symptoms
*   **Weakness of Voice:** Often the earliest symptom,,.
*   **Hoarseness:** Progressive and chronic,.
*   **Odynophagia (Painful Swallowing):** This is a hallmark feature. Pain is severe (often radiating to the ears) and is usually worse with liquids than solids due to exposed nerve endings,,.
*   **Constitutional Symptoms:** Fever (evening rise), weight loss, night sweats, fatigue, and chronic cough (associated with pulmonary TB),,.

#### Signs (Laryngoscopic Findings)

> Draw a larynx showing "Turban Epiglottis", "Mouse-nibbled vocal cords", and "Mammillated arytenoids"

1.  **Posterior Commissure Involvement:** Hyperemia and thickening of the interarytenoid area,.
2.  **Mammillated Arytenoids:** Swelling in the interarytenoid region gives a "mammillated" (nipple-like) appearance,,.
3.  **Mouse-Nibbled Vocal Cords:** Ulceration of the vocal cords creates a serrated, irregular edge described as a "mouse-nibbled" appearance,,,.
4.  **Turban Epiglottis:** Pseudoedema and infiltration of the epiglottis cause it to become swollen, red, and turban-shaped. This is a late sign,,,.
5.  **Pallor:** The surrounding laryngeal mucosa often appears notably pale,.
6.  **Ulceration:** Superficial, ragged ulcers with undermined edges, covered by grayish granulation tissue,.

### Diagnosis and Investigations
1.  **Laryngoscopy:** Reveals the characteristic signs mentioned above (Turban epiglottis, mouse-nibbled cords).
2.  **Chest X-ray (CXR):** Essential to rule out active pulmonary tuberculosis (apical infiltrates/cavities),,.
3.  **Sputum Examination:** For Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB) and culture,.
4.  **Laryngeal Biopsy:** Mandatory to exclude [[Laryngeal Carcinoma]] and confirm granulomatous pathology (caseating granulomas, Langhans giant cells),,.
5.  **Mantoux Test:** Usually positive.

### Differential Diagnosis
It is crucial to differentiate TB larynx from other conditions, particularly malignancy.

| Feature | **Tuberculosis Larynx** | **Carcinoma Larynx** | **Syphilis Larynx** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pain** | **Severe** (Odynophagia) | Painless (early); Painful (late) | Painless |
| **Site** | **Posterior** larynx (Arytenoids) | Anterior > Posterior | Anterior (Epiglottis) |
| **Appearance** | Pale, Pseudoedema, Mouse-nibbled ulcer | Hyperemic, Proliferative/Ulcerative growth | Gumma (Deep punched-out ulcer), Wash-leather base |
| **Voice** | Weak/Aphonic | Hoarse | Rough/Hoarse |
| **Systemic** | Fever, Weight loss | Cachexia (late) | General well-being good |
| **Diagnostic** | Sputum AFB +, Biopsy | Biopsy | Serology (VDRL/TPHA) |

> *   **M** - **M**ouse-nibbled cords / **M**ammillated arytenoids / **M**iddle-aged Males

### Management

**Medical Management:**
*   **Anti-Tubercular Therapy (ATT):** The primary treatment. Prolonged course of Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, and Ethambutol,,.
*   **Voice Rest:** Essential to reduce laryngeal strain,.
*   **Symptomatic Relief:** Analgesics for pain; steam inhalation to loosen secretions,.
*   **Steroids:** May be used in severe cases to reduce edema and prevent fibrosis/stenosis.

**Surgical Management:**
*   **Tracheostomy:** Indicated if there is stridor/airway obstruction due to severe edema or stenosis,.
*   **Surgical Reconstruction:** Only considered for sequelae like laryngeal stenosis *after* the infection is completely inactive,.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Infectivity:** Laryngeal TB is highly contagious due to the high load of bacilli in the sputum and aerosolization during coughing/phonation. Isolation is important until the patient is non-infectious.
*   **Mimicry:** TB can clinically resemble [[Squamous cell carcinoma]]. A biopsy is always required to differentiate, and sometimes the two conditions coexist,.
*   **Lupus of Larynx:** A rare, indolent, painless form of TB affecting the **anterior** larynx (Epiglottis), unlike standard TB which affects the posterior larynx,.
