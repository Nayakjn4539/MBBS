# Accommodation Anomalies

[[Accommodation]] is the mechanism by which the eye changes its refractive power to focus on near objects. This process primarily involves the contraction of the [[Ciliary Muscle]], relaxation of the [[Zonules]], and an increase in the curvature of the [[Crystalline Lens]] (Helmholtz theory).

Anomalies of accommodation can be classified into physiological (Presbyopia) and pathological conditions (Insufficiency, Paralysis, and Spasm).

### 1. Presbyopia (Physiological Anomaly)
**Definition:** A condition of physiological insufficiency of accommodation leading to a progressive fall in near vision. It is not a refractive error but a physiological aging process.

**Pathophysiology:**
*   **Lens Sclerosis:** Progressive increase in size and hardness (sclerosis) of the lens substance, making it less moldable.
*   **Capsular Changes:** Decrease in the elasticity of the [[Lens Capsule]].
*   **Muscle Weakness:** Age-related decline in ciliary muscle power.

**Clinical Features:**
*   **Onset:** Usually manifests around 40 years of age.
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Difficulty reading small print (threading a needle), initially worse in dim light.
    *   **Asthenopia:** Eye strain, frontal headache, and fatigue after near work.
    *   **Intermittent Diplopia:** Due to disturbed relationship between accommodation and [[Convergence]].
    *   Receding Near Point: The patient tends to hold reading material farther away.

**Treatment:**
*   **Optical:** Prescription of convex (+) lenses for near work.
*   **Surgical:** Monovision LASIK, Conductive Keratoplasty (CK), or Multifocal [[Intraocular Lens]] (IOL) implantation.

**Rough Guide for Presbyopic Correction (in Emmetropes):**

| Age (Years) | Near Add Required (Diopters) |
| :--- | :--- |
| 40–45 | +1.0 D |
| 45–50 | +1.5 D |
| 50–55 | +2.0 D |
| 55–60 | +2.5 D |
| > 60 | +2.5 D to +3.0 D (Max accommodative need) |

> **Clinical Implication:** In uncorrected [[Hypermetropia]], presbyopic symptoms appear earlier (**Premature Presbyopia**). In [[Myopia]], symptoms appear later or may not manifest if the myopia is sufficient to counteract the loss of accommodation.

### 2. Insufficiency of Accommodation
**Definition:** A condition where the accommodative power is significantly less than the normal physiological limits for the patient's age. This differs from presbyopia as it is non-physiological for that age group.

**Etiology:**
*   **Premature Sclerosis:** Accelerated hardening of the lens.
*   **Systemic Weakness:** Debilitating illness, anemia, toxemia, malnutrition, diabetes mellitus, pregnancy, and stress.
*   **Ocular Disease:** Weakness of ciliary muscle associated with [[Primary Open Angle Glaucoma]] (prodromal stage).

**Clinical Features:**
*   Similar to presbyopia but occurs prematurely.
*   **Asthenopia:** Eye ache and brow ache are often more prominent than actual blurring of vision.
*   Near work fatigue.

**Treatment:**
*   Treat the underlying systemic or ocular cause.
*   **Accommodative Exercises:** To strengthen ciliary muscle tone.
*   **Optical:** Weakest convex lenses required for clear near vision (temporary support).

### 3. Paralysis of Accommodation (Cycloplegia)
**Definition:** Complete absence of accommodation. Usually associated with paralysis of the sphincter pupillae (mydriasis), a condition known as **Internal Ophthalmoplegia**.

**Etiology:**
1.  **Drug-Induced (Cycloplegics):**
    *   [[Atropine]] (effect lasts up to 2 weeks).
    *   Homatropine, Cyclopentolate, Tropicamide.
2.  **Disease-Induced:**
    *   **Diphtheria:** Post-diphtheric paralysis (often bilateral).
    *   Neurosyphilis, Diabetes, Alcoholism.
    *   Cerebral or meningeal diseases.
3.  **Neurological:**
    *   [[Third Nerve Palsy]] (Oculomotor nerve): Lesions affecting the Edinger-Westphal nucleus or nerve trunk.
    *   Trauma to the ciliary ganglion.
    *   **Adie's Tonic Pupil:** Segmental palsy with light-near dissociation.

**Clinical Features:**
*   **Blurring of Near Vision:** Most marked in [[Emmetropia]] and [[Hypermetropia]]. Myopes may notice less difficulty.
*   **Photophobia (Glare):** Due to associated pupil dilation ([[Mydriasis]]).
*   **Micropsia:** Objects appear smaller.
*   Receding near point and loss of accommodation range.

**Treatment:**
*   **Self-recovery:** Common in drug-induced or diphtheric cases once the toxin/drug clears.
*   **Optical:** Convex lenses for near vision if paralysis is permanent.
*   **Photophobia Management:** Dark glasses/sunglasses.

### 4. Spasm of Accommodation
**Definition:** Exertion of abnormally excessive accommodation by the ciliary muscle. Also referred to as **[[Pseudomyopia]]**.

**Etiology:**
1.  **Drug-Induced:**
    *   Strong **[[Miotics]]** (e.g., Echothiophate, Pilocarpine, Physostigmine).
    *   Excessive use of cholinergic agents.
2.  **Spontaneous/Functional:**
    *   Excessive near work in unfavorable conditions (bad lighting, poor posture).
    *   Uncorrected refractive errors (young hypermetropes trying to focus).
    *   Anxiety, hysteria, or mental stress.

**Clinical Features:**
*   **Defective Distant Vision:** The eye is locked in a focused state for near, mimicking [[Myopia]] (Pseudomyopia).
*   **Asthenopia:** Severe frontal headache and eye pain.
*   **Macropsia:** Objects appear larger.
*   **Miosis:** Pupil constriction is often associated.

**Diagnosis:**
*   **Cycloplegic Refraction:** Essential to differentiate from true myopia. Under [[Atropine]], the spasm relaxes, revealing the true refractive state (often emmetropia or hypermetropia).

**Treatment:**
*   **Cycloplegics:** Relax the ciliary muscle (e.g., Atropine ointment or drops for a few weeks).
*   **Visual Hygiene:** Prohibition of near work for a period; correction of lighting and posture.
*   **Correction:** Proper spectacle prescription after the spasm has resolved.
