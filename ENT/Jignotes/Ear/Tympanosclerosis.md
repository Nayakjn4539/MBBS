# Tympanosclerosis

### Definition
[[Tympanosclerosis]] is an abnormal condition of the middle ear characterized by **hyalinization** and subsequent **calcification** of the subepithelial connective tissue. It is essentially an irreversible, non-specific end result of a healing process in response to chronic inflammation.

*   **Location:** It typically affects the fibrous layer of the [[Tympanic membrane]] (TM) and the submucosa of the [[Middle ear cleft]].
*   **Terminological Distinction:**
    *   **Myringosclerosis:** When the plaque is confined only to the tympanic membrane.
    *   **Intratympanic Tympanosclerosis:** When it involves the ossicles, ligaments, and muscle tendons.

### Etiology and Risk Factors
It is commonly a sequela of chronic inflammation or trauma. Key associations include:

*   **Chronic Otitis Media:** Specifically [[Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media]] (CSOM) or recurrent infections.
*   **Otitis Media with Effusion (OME):** Long-term [[Glue ear]].
*   **Surgical Trauma:**
    *   **Ventilation Tubes ([[Grommet]]):** High correlation; patients with grommets have a 59% chance of developing plaques compared to 13% with myringotomy alone.
    *   **Myringotomy**.
    *   **Tympanoplasty**.

### Pathogenesis
The formation of tympanosclerosis follows a specific pathological sequence:

1.  **Chronic Inflammation/Trauma:** Leads to repeated damage of the middle ear mucosa and the fibrous layer of the TM.
2.  **Fibroblast Activation:** Production of excess collagen.
3.  **Hyalinization:** Collagen fibers undergo degeneration, becoming glassy and homogeneous.
4.  **Dystrophic Calcification:** Calcium phosphate deposits accumulate in the degenerated tissue (despite normal serum calcium levels).

### Clinical Features

#### Symptoms
*   **Asymptomatic:** The majority of cases, especially if confined to the tympanic membrane, cause no symptoms.
*   **Hearing Loss:**
    *   **Type:** [[Conductive Hearing Loss]] (CHL).
    *   **Cause:** Occurs if the plaques involve the [[Ossicles]], ossicular ligaments, or joints, leading to **fixation** of the ossicular chain.
    *   It can also affect the [[Oval window]] or [[Round window]].
*   **Mixed Hearing Loss:** Rare; occurs if the inner ear is affected.

#### Signs (Otoscopy)
*   **Appearance:** Characteristic **chalky white plaques**.
*   **Shape:** Often crescent-shaped or diffuse.
*   **Location:** Found on the pars tensa of the [[Tympanic membrane]].
*   **Mobility:** May show restricted mobility on pneumatic otoscopy.

> **Clinical Implication:**
> A white patch on the eardrum is not always tympanosclerosis. The **Differential Diagnosis** for a white mass/patch includes:
> *   [[Congenital Cholesteatoma]] (white mass *behind* an intact TM).
> *   **Otomycosis** (fungal debris, often looks like wet newspaper or cotton wool).
> *   **Dried ear drops**.

### Classification (Histological/Clinical)
Based on the aggressiveness and location, it can be classified as:

| Type | Characteristics | Surgical Prognosis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sclerosing Mucositis** | Superficial lesions. | Amenable to total surgical removal. |
| **Osteoclastic Mucoperiostitis** | Invasive form; erodes bone. | Defies complete removal; higher recurrence. |

### Investigations

#### 1. Tuning Fork Tests
*   **Rinne Test:** Negative (BC > AC) if ossicular fixation causes significant air-bone gap.
*   **Weber Test:** Lateralizes to the ear with greater conductive loss.

#### 2. Pure Tone Audiometry ([[PTA]])
*   Demonstrates **Conductive Hearing Loss**.
*   Degree depends on ossicular fixation; if only the TM is involved, hearing is usually normal.

#### 3. Impedance Audiometry (Tympanometry)
*   **Type As Curve:** Reduced compliance with normal middle ear pressure.
*   **Why?** The stiffness of the system is increased due to calcium deposits.

#### 4. Imaging
*   **CT Scan:** Shows calcified plaques/densities in the middle ear but is generally not required for diagnosis unless surgery is planned for ossicular fixation.

---

### Management

#### Conservative
*   **Observation:** No treatment is required for asymptomatic plaques confined to the tympanic membrane (Myringosclerosis).
*   **Hearing Aids:** For patients with conductive hearing loss who are unfit or unwilling for surgery.

#### Surgical
Surgery is indicated only if there is significant conductive hearing loss due to ossicular fixation.

1.  **Exploratory Tympanotomy:** To assess mobility.
2.  **Removal of Plaques:**
    *   **Middle Ear:** Carefully removing plaques from ossicular joints or tendons to mobilize the chain.
    *   **Tympanic Membrane:** Removal is generally **avoided** or done with extreme caution, as removing the plaque often results in a large perforation.
3.  **Ossiculoplasty:** If the ossicular chain cannot be mobilized (e.g., severe fixation of malleus or incus), ossicular reconstruction or [[Stapedectomy]] may be required.
    *   **Contraindication:** Tympanosclerosis at the round window or stapes head is often a contraindication to surgery due to poor results; hearing aids are preferred.
