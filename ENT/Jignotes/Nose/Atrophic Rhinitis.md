# Atrophic Rhinitis (Ozaena)

**Definition**
[[Atrophic Rhinitis]], also historically known as **Ozaena**, is a chronic inflammatory disease of the nose characterized by progressive atrophy of the nasal mucosa, the underlying turbinate bones, and the nerve elements. It is clinically characterized by the presence of large, foul-smelling greenish crusts and roomy nasal cavities.

### Classification
1.  **Primary Atrophic Rhinitis:** Idiopathic (cause unknown).
2.  **Secondary Atrophic Rhinitis:** Secondary to specific infections or trauma.

### Primary Atrophic Rhinitis

#### Etiology
The exact cause is unknown, but several theories have been proposed.
**Mnemonic: HERNIA**
*   **H**ereditary: Strong family history observed; autosomal dominant pattern suspected.
*   **E**ndocrine: Commonly starts at puberty; involves females more than males; symptoms tend to regress after menopause (estrogen deficiency theory).
*   **R**acial: More common in White and Yellow races; rare in natives of equatorial Africa.
*   **N**utritional: Deficiency of Vitamin A, D, or Iron. Common in low socioeconomic groups.
*   **I**nfective: Specific organisms are often cultured, though they may be secondary invaders responsible for the foul smell rather than the primary cause.
    *   *[[Klebsiella ozaenae]]* (Perez bacillus)
    *   *Coccobacillus foetidus*
    *   *Proteus vulgaris*, *E. coli*, Staphylococci
*   **A**utoimmune: Destructive autoimmune process triggered by viral infection or malnutrition.

**Other factors:**
*   **Surfactant deficiency:** Abnormal phospholipid profile in nasal aspirate.
*   **Sympathetic overactivity:** Leading to vasoconstriction and ischemia.

#### Pathology
The pathological changes involve the mucosa, bone, and blood vessels:
1.  **Epithelium:** Ciliated columnar epithelium undergoes **squamous metaplasia** into stratified squamous epithelium. Loss of cilia leads to stasis of secretions.
2.  **Glands:** Atrophy of seromucinous glands results in viscid secretions that dry up to form crusts.
3.  **Vessels:** **Obliterative endarteritis** and periarteritis lead to decreased blood supply.
4.  **Bone:** Resorption of turbinate bones (especially the [[Inferior Turbinate]]) causes widening of nasal chambers.
5.  **Nerves:** Atrophy of olfactory nerves leads to anosmia.

**Types based on Pathology:**
*   **Type I:** Associated with endarteritis and periarteritis.
*   **Type II:** Associated with vasodilatation of capillaries and increased alkaline phosphatase activity leading to bone resorption.

#### Clinical Features
*   **Age/Sex:** Usually seen in young females (puberty).
*   **Foul Smell (Foetor):** A characteristic offensive odor (stench) emanates from the nose.
    *   **Clinical Implication:** The patient is usually unaware of the smell due to associated anosmia. This phenomenon is known as **[[Merciful Anosmia]]** or **Blissful Anosmia**. The smell often makes the patient a social outcast.
*   **Nasal Obstruction:** Paradoxical sensation of obstruction. despite **roomy nasal cavities**, the patient feels blocked due to:
    *   Mechanical obstruction by large crusts.
    *   Atrophy of sensory nerve endings (loss of air flow sensation).
*   **Epistaxis:** Bleeding occurs when dry crusts are forcibly removed.
*   **Pharyngeal symptoms:** Dryness and irritation in the throat ([[Atrophic Pharyngitis]]) due to inhalation of non-conditioned air.
*   **Hearing impairment:** Due to obstruction of the Eustachian tube.

#### Examination Signs
*   **External Nose:** May show a **[[Saddle Nose Deformity]]** due to destruction of the septal cartilage/bone.
*   **Anterior Rhinoscopy:**
    *   Nasal cavities are full of greenish-yellow or greyish-black dry **crusts** covering turbinates and septum.
    *   **Roomy Nasal Cavity:** Upon removal of crusts, the cavities appear vastly enlarged. The posterior wall of the [[Nasopharynx]] and the torus tubarius can be easily visualized through the anterior nares.
    *   **Turbinates:** Atrophied, appearing as mere ridges.
    *   **Mucosa:** Pale and dry.
    *   **Septal Perforation:** May be present.

### Secondary Atrophic Rhinitis
This occurs due to destruction of nasal structures by specific diseases or trauma.
*   **Chronic Granulomatous Diseases:** [[Syphilis]] (Tertiary), [[Lupus Vulgaris]], [[Leprosy]], [[Rhinoscleroma]].
*   **Iatrogenic:** Extensive destruction of turbinates during surgery (Radical turbinectomy).
*   **Radiation:** Post-radiotherapy to the nose.
*   **Long-standing Purulent Sinusitis.**

**Unilateral Atrophic Rhinitis:**
Occurs in cases of extreme **[[Deviated Nasal Septum]]** (DNS). The atrophic changes occur on the wider (concave) side of the nose, while the narrower side may show compensatory hypertrophy.

### Differential Diagnosis
| Feature | Atrophic Rhinitis (Ozaena) | [[Rhinitis Sicca]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Site** | Whole nasal cavity (diffuse) | Anterior 1/3rd of nose (Septum/Vestibule) |
| **Cause** | Idiopathic/Infective/Hereditary | Occupational (Hot, dry, dusty environment) |
| **Crusts** | Greenish-yellow, foul smelling | Dirty black/grey, no foul smell |
| **Atrophy** | Turbinates and mucosa atrophied | Squamous metaplasia, no gross atrophy of turbinates |
| **Foetor** | Present | Absent |
| **Associations** | Anosmia, Saddle nose | Epistaxis, Septal perforation |

### Management

The goal is to maintain nasal hygiene, remove crusts, and eliminate the foul smell.

#### Medical Management (Conservative)
1.  **Nasal Irrigation (Alkaline Douche):**
    *   **Composition:** Sodium Bicarbonate (1 part), Sodium Biborate (1 part), Sodium Chloride (2 parts) dissolved in warm water.
    *   **Action:** Loosens crusts, thins tenacious discharge, and neutralizes acidity.
2.  **25% Glucose in Glycerin Drops:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Glucose inhibits the growth of proteolytic organisms (which cause the smell) by promoting lactic acid fermentation. Glycerin acts as a hygroscopic agent (moisturizer) and lubricant.
3.  **Local Antibiotics:**
    *   **Kemicetine Solution:** Used as nasal drops/spray.
    *   **Mnemonic: COPD**
        *   **C**hloramphenicol (Antibiotic)
        *   **O**estradiol (Increases vascularity)
        *   **P**ropylene glycol (Vehicle/Moisturizer)
        *   **D** – Vitamin D2
4.  **Systemic Antibiotics:** Streptomycin (1g/day for 10 days) is effective against *Klebsiella ozaenae*. Oral Potassium Iodide promotes nasal secretions.
5.  **Placental Extract:** Submucosal injection to improve vascularity.

#### Surgical Management
Indicated when medical treatment fails. The aim is to narrow the nasal cavity or give rest to the mucosa.

1.  **[[Young's Operation]] (Nasal Closure):**
    *   Both nostrils are completely closed by raising mucosal flaps and suturing them together.
    *   **Duration:** Kept closed for 6 months to 1 year.
    *   **Outcome:** Mucosa reverts to normal, and crusting/foetor disappears due to rest from air currents.
2.  **Modified Young's Operation:**
    *   Partial closure of nostrils (leaving a 3mm opening).
    *   Advantage: Avoids the discomfort of total mouth breathing associated with Young's operation.
3.  **Narrowing the Nasal Cavity:**
    *   **Lautenschlager’s Operation:** Medial displacement of the lateral nasal wall.
    *   **Implants:** Submucosal injection of Teflon paste, or insertion of fat, cartilage, or bone grafts under the mucoperiosteum to reduce the airway size.
4.  **Wittmaack’s Operation:** Transplantation of the parotid duct (Stensen's duct) into the maxillary sinus/nasal cavity to provide secretions (saliva) for moistening. (Rarely done now due to complications like gustatory rhinitis).
