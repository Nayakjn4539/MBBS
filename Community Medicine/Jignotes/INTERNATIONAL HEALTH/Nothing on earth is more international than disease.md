# [[INTERNATIONAL HEALTH]] > Nothing on earth is more international than disease

### "Nothing on earth is more international than disease"

This famous statement was made by **Paul Russel** to emphasize that health and disease have no political or geographical boundaries. Disease in any part of the world is a constant threat to other parts.

#### 1. The Concept of Global Threat
*   **No Frontiers:** Microorganisms do not respect national borders. History is replete with examples of the spread of pestilences, particularly [[Plague]] and [[Cholera]], along trade routes.
*   **Modern Speed:** In the age of jet travel, an outbreak anywhere must be seen as a threat to virtually all countries. International travellers can carry diseases like [[Malaria]], [[Influenza]], and [[HIV]] from endemic zones to non-endemic areas.
*   **Common Danger:** The Constitution of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) explicitly states that unequal development in different countries in the promotion of health and control of disease, especially communicable disease, is a **common danger**.

#### 2. Justification for International Cooperation
International health cooperation is essential for the following reasons:
1.  **Transmissible Nature:** Diseases spread from one country to another. For example, Syphilis was historically known as *'Firangi Rog'* in India because it was believed to be imported by Europeans.
2.  **Knowledge Sharing:** Medical research, knowledge, and developments (e.g., vaccines, treatments) should not be confined to one country but must be freely available to all mankind.
3.  **Economic and Social Impact:** Poor health conditions lead to poor economic development. The disparity between developed and developing countries is a danger to world peace.
4.  **Global Issues:** Problems like population explosion and environmental pollution (e.g., ozone layer depletion) affect the survival of the human race and require joint international efforts,.

#### 3. Historical Failure of Isolation
*   In the 14th century, **[[Quarantine]]** (detention for 40 days) was introduced to protect against Plague.
*   However, these barriers failed because they obstructed trade and lacked scientific basis regarding disease transmission.
*   This failure necessitated international agreement and the formation of international health agencies like the **Pan American Sanitary Bureau (1902)**, the **Office International d’Hygiene Publique (1907)**, and eventually the **[[WHO]]** in 1948,,.

#### 4. International Health Regulations (IHR)
To manage this international threat with minimum interference to world traffic, specific diseases are notified to the WHO under IHR.

| **Category** | **Diseases** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Subject to IHR (1969)** | • [[Cholera]]<br>• [[Plague]]<br>• [[Yellow Fever]] |
| **Under WHO Surveillance** | • Louse-borne typhus fever<br>• Relapsing fever<br>• Paralytic [[Orthopaedics/Jignotes/Pediatric Orthopaedics/Poliomyelitis]]<br>• [[Malaria]]<br>• Viral [[Influenza]] A<br>• SARS<br>• Smallpox |

> **Clinical Relevance:**
> **Emporiatrics** is the science of the health of travellers. Physicians must advise travellers on specific risks (e.g., Malaria, Yellow Fever) and vaccination requirements because a traveller returning home can introduce a disease into a receptive area (e.g., introducing Yellow Fever into India which is a receptive area),.
