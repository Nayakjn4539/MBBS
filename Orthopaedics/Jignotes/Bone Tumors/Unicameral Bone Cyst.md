# [[Bone Tumors]] > Unicameral Bone Cyst

### Unicameral Bone Cyst (Simple Bone Cyst)

**Definition**
A [[Unicameral Bone Cyst]] (UBC), also known as a **Simple Bone Cyst**, is a benign, fluid-filled, unicameral (one chamber) cavity within the bone. It is classified as a tumor-like lesion rather than a true neoplasm. It is the only true [[cyst]] of the bone.

### Epidemiology
*   **Age:** Predominantly affects children and adolescents (5–15 years). Rarely seen in adults.
*   **Sex:** Males are affected more frequently than females (ratio approx 2:1).
*   **Incidence:** Common cause of pathological fractures in children.

### Site of Involvement
*   **Location:** Always situated in the [[metaphysis]] of long bones.
*   **Most Common Bones:**
    1.  **Proximal Humerus** (Upper end) - Most frequent site.
    2.  Proximal Femur (Upper end).
*   **Migration:** The cyst originates adjacent to the [[physis]] (growth plate). As the bone grows, the cyst remains static in the bone tissue while the growth plate moves away, causing the cyst to appear to migrate towards the [[diaphysis]].

### Classification (Based on Activity)
1.  **Active Cyst:**
    *   Situated immediately adjacent to the [[epiphyseal plate]].
    *   Has growth potential and can destroy the growth plate, leading to deformity.
    *   Usually seen in younger children (< 10 years).
2.  **Latent (Static) Cyst:**
    *   Separated from the growth plate by normal cancellous bone.
    *   Located more towards the diaphysis.
    *   Usually seen in older children; less likely to recur after treatment.

### Pathogenesis and Pathology
*   **Etiology:** Unknown, but theories suggest localized disturbance of bone growth or venous obstruction leading to increased intramedullary pressure and resorption.
*   **Gross Pathology:** A cavity lined by a thin membrane containing clear, yellow, serous fluid (resembling serum).
*   **Histopathology:**
    *   The wall is lined by a thin layer of flattened connective tissue (fibrous membrane).
    *   May show scattered [[giant cells]] and [[hemosiderin]] pigment (especially if there has been a recent fracture).
    *   **Fluid:** High in prostaglandins and enzymes that promote bone resorption.

### Clinical Features
*   **Asymptomatic:** The majority are silent and discovered incidentally on X-rays taken for other reasons.
*   **Pathological Fracture:** This is the most common mode of presentation. The child presents with pain following trivial trauma.
*   **Swelling:** Rarely produces a visible lump unless the bone is very superficial.
*   **Stiffness:** Joint movement is usually normal unless a fracture has occurred.

### Radiological Features (X-ray)

*   **Lucency:** A well-defined, central, radiolucent (lytic) area.
*   **Location:** Metaphyseal, extending towards the diaphysis.
*   **Expansion:** The cyst expands the bone, thinning the cortex (thinned out cortex), but strictly remains within the periosteum. It is usually **not** wider than the epiphyseal plate.
*   **Septations:** May appear multiloculated due to ridges on the bony wall (pseudo-septations), but it is truly unicameral.
*   **"Fallen Leaf" or "Fallen Fragment" Sign:**
    *   **Pathognomonic sign.**
    *   Occurs when a pathological fracture causes a fragment of the cortical bone to break off and fall to the bottom of the cyst.
    *   Because the cyst contains fluid (unlike solid tumors or fibrous dysplasia), the fragment sinks freely to the dependent portion of the lesion.

**Clinical Implication:** The Fallen Fragment Sign helps distinguish a UBC from an [[Aneurysmal Bone Cyst]] (ABC) or [[Fibrous Dysplasia]], where the internal structure prevents the fragment from falling.

### Differential Diagnosis

| Feature | Simple Bone Cyst (UBC) | Aneurysmal Bone Cyst (ABC) | Giant Cell Tumor (GCT) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Age** | < 20 years (Children) | 10–20 years | 20–40 years |
| **Location** | Metaphysis (Central) | Metaphysis (Eccentric) | Epiphysis (Eccentric) |
| **Fluid** | Serous / Straw colored | Blood-filled | Solid tumor |
| **X-ray** | Central, not wider than physis | Eccentric, "Blow-out" / Ballooning | Soap-bubble appearance |
| **Diagnostic Sign** | Fallen Fragment Sign | Fluid-fluid levels (MRI) | Extension to subchondral bone |

### Treatment

**1. Conservative Management**
*   **Observation:** Small, asymptomatic latent cysts in the upper limb may be observed as they tend to heal spontaneously after skeletal maturity.
*   **Fracture Management:** If a pathological fracture occurs, allow the fracture to heal first with immobilization (splint/cast). Surprisingly, the fracture callus may sometimes stimulate the cyst to heal spontaneously.

**2. Minimally Invasive Therapy**
*   **Aspiration and Steroid Injection:**
    *   Currently the standard first-line treatment for active cysts.
    *   **Procedure:** Two needles are inserted into the cyst. Fluid is aspirated, and contrast is injected to confirm unicameral nature. Then, [[Methylprednisolone]] acetate (40–80 mg or up to 160 mg) is injected.
    *   **Mechanism:** Steroids reduce the secretion of prostaglandins and fluid, allowing the cyst to heal.
    *   May need repetition 2–3 times at intervals of a few months.
*   **Bone Marrow Injection:** Injection of autologous bone marrow aspirated from the iliac crest can stimulate osteogenesis.

**3. Surgical Management**
*   **Indications:**
    *   High risk of fracture (weight-bearing bones like the femur).
    *   Cysts that fail to respond to injections.
    *   Active cysts enlarging rapidly.
*   **Curettage and Bone Grafting:**
    *   The cyst wall is thoroughly scraped (curettage) to remove the lining membrane.
    *   The cavity is packed with bone chips ([[autograft]] from iliac crest or [[allograft]]) or bone substitutes.
    *   **Internal Fixation:** May be required if the structural integrity of the bone is compromised, especially in the proximal femur.

### Complications
1.  **Pathological Fracture:** Most common complication.
2.  **Growth Arrest:** If the cyst or surgical intervention damages the [[physis]], it can lead to limb length discrepancy or deformity.
3.  **Recurrence:** Common, especially in active cysts (those adjacent to the growth plate).
