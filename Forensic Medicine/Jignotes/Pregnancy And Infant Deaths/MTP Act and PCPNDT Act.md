# MEDICAL TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY (MTP) ACT

The [[MTP Act]] was enacted in 1971 and implemented in April 1972 (except J&K) to legalize abortion under specific conditions, primarily to reduce maternal mortality from [[Criminal Abortion]]. It has been significantly amended in **2021**.

### 1. Indications for MTP
Pregnancy can be terminated only if the medical practitioner acts in good faith and the case falls under the following grounds.

*   **T - Therapeutic:** Continuation of pregnancy involves a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or grave injury to her physical or mental health.
*   **H - Humanitarian:** Pregnancy caused by **Rape**. (Anguish caused by such pregnancy is presumed to constitute grave injury to mental health).
*   **E - Eugenic:** Substantial risk that if the child were born, it would suffer from physical or mental abnormalities to be seriously handicapped.
*   **S - Social/Environmental:** Pregnancy resulting from **failure of any device or method** used by any woman or her partner to limit the number of children (Contraceptive failure). 
    *   *Note:* The 2021 Amendment replaced "married woman" with "any woman", covering unmarried women under failure of contraception.

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Goal** | Legalize abortion, reduce maternal mortality. | Prevent sex selection and female foeticide. |
| **Consent** | Patient (Guardian if minor/mentally ill). Spouse not needed. | Patient's written consent mandatory before procedure. |

**Important Note for Exams:**
*   **"Decoy Operations":** Authorities often use decoys (pregnant women posing as patients asking for sex determination) to catch doctors violating the PCPNDT Act.
*   Under PCPNDT, the burden of proof lies on the **accused** (doctor) to prove innocence (that they did not determine the sex).
