# [[Upper Limb]] > Recurrent Shoulder Dislocation

### Recurrent Shoulder Dislocation

**Recurrent Anterior Dislocation** of the [[Shoulder joint]] is a common complication following an initial traumatic dislocation, especially in young adults,. The pathology involves structural defects in the stabilizing mechanisms of the [[Glenohumeral joint]], predominantly affecting the anterior capsule and the humeral head.

### Pathophysiology and Key Lesions

The recurrence is usually due to the failure of the detached soft tissues (labrum and capsule) to heal back to the [[Glenoid]] rim or due to bone loss.

#### 1. [[Bankart Lesion]]
This is the "essential lesion" responsible for recurrent anterior instability.
*   **Definition:** It is the avulsion/detachment of the **antero-inferior** [[Glenoid labrum]] and the anterior capsule from the anterior rim of the glenoid,.
*   **Mechanism:** During anterior dislocation, the humeral head shears off the labral attachment.
*   **Consequence:** It creates a "pocket" anteriorly, leading to laxity of the [[Inferior glenohumeral ligament]] and loss of the concavity effect of the labrum, allowing the humeral head to slip out easily.
*   **Bony Bankart:** If a fragment of the glenoid bone is avulsed along with the labrum, it is termed a [[Bony Bankart lesion]].

#### 2. [[Hill-Sachs Lesion]]
*   **Definition:** It is a compression fracture or indentation on the **posterolateral** aspect of the [[Humeral head]],.
*   **Mechanism:** It occurs when the soft cancellous bone of the humeral head impacts against the hard, sharp anterior rim of the glenoid during dislocation,.
*   **Consequence:** A large defect can engage with the anterior glenoid rim during abduction and external rotation, acting as a lever to pry the head out of the socket, precipitating recurrent dislocation.

**Table: Comparison of Lesions**

| Feature | [[Bankart Lesion]] | [[Hill-Sachs Lesion]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Location** | Antero-inferior Glenoid Rim | Posterolateral Humeral Head |
| **Structure** | Soft tissue (Labrum/Capsule) or Bone | Bone (Compression fracture) |
| **Mechanism** | Avulsion/Detachment | Impaction/Indentation |
| **Significance** | Primary cause of instability | Engaging lesions cause failure |

### Classification (Matsen’s Classification)

This classification helps in deciding the management protocol,.

#### 1. TUBS (Traumatic)
*   **T**raumatic etiology.
*   **U**nidirectional (Anterior).
*   **B**ankart lesion is present.
*   **S**urgery is the treatment of choice (Bankart repair).

#### 2. AMBRI (Atraumatic)
*   **A**traumatic etiology (Generalized laxity).
*   **M**ultidirectional instability.
*   **B**ilateral shoulder involvement.
*   **R**ehabilitation is the primary treatment.
*   **I**nferior capsular shift is done if surgery is needed.

### Clinical Features

*   **History:** The patient gives a history of a primary traumatic dislocation followed by repeated episodes of dislocation with trivial trauma (e.g., throwing a ball, combing hair, putting on a shirt),.
*   **Dead Arm Syndrome:** The patient may experience a "catching" sensation followed by numbness or weakness in the arm during throwing motions.
*   **Apprehension Test:**
    *   This is the most diagnostic clinical sign.
    *   **Technique:** With the patient seated or supine, the examiner abducts the arm to 90 degrees and externally rotates it while applying mild anterior pressure on the humeral head.
    *   **Positive Result:** The patient resists the movement and shows anxiety/fear (apprehension) that the shoulder will dislocate, rather than complaining of pain,.

### Diagnostic Imaging

1.  **X-rays:**
    *   **AP View:** May show the dislocation or bony defects.
    *   **Stryker Notch View:** Specifically used to identify the [[Hill-Sachs lesion]].
    *   **West Point Axillary View:** Useful for assessing glenoid bone loss ([[Bony Bankart lesion]]).
2.  **MRI / MR Arthrography:**
    *   **Gold Standard** for soft tissue lesions.
    *   It clearly demonstrates the [[Bankart lesion]] (labral tear) and capsular laxity,.
3.  **CT Scan:**
    *   Best for evaluating **bone loss** (size of Hill-Sachs or Bony Bankart) to plan surgery (e.g., Latarjet procedure).

### Management

#### Conservative Treatment
*   Indicated for patients with low functional demands or those fitting the **AMBRI** classification.
*   Focuses on strengthening the [[Rotator cuff]] muscles (dynamic stabilizers) and deltoid,.

#### Operative Treatment
Surgery is indicated for young active individuals, contact athletes, or those with frequent dislocations affecting daily life (TUBS group).

**1. Arthroscopic Bankart Repair**
*   **Procedure:** Reattachment of the torn [[Glenoid labrum]] and capsule to the glenoid rim using suture anchors.
*   **Indication:** Soft tissue Bankart lesion with minimal bone loss.

**2. Open Bankart Repair**
*   Traditional open surgery to repair the capsule and labrum. Usually allows for tightening of the capsule (capsulorrhaphy).

**3. Putti-Platt Operation**
*   **Procedure:** Double-breasting (shortening) of the [[Subscapularis tendon]] and anterior capsule.
*   **Mechanism:** Limits external rotation, thereby preventing the head from reaching the position of dislocation.
*   **Disadvantage:** Can lead to permanent loss of external rotation and subsequent osteoarthritis.

**4. Bristow-Latarjet Procedure**
*   **Procedure:** The [[Coracoid process]] (along with the conjoined tendon of the short head of biceps and coracobrachialis) is osteotomized and transferred to the anterior inferior glenoid neck,.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **Bone Block:** Restores glenoid bone stock.
    *   **Sling Effect:** The conjoined tendon acts as a dynamic sling holding the humeral head back when the arm is abducted and externally rotated.
*   **Indication:** Recurrent dislocation with significant **glenoid bone loss** or large **Hill-Sachs lesions** (engaging lesions).

**5. Remplissage**
*   **Procedure:** The [[Infraspinatus]] tendon and posterior capsule are sutured into the Hill-Sachs defect.
*   **Indication:** Large Hill-Sachs lesions to prevent them from engaging with the glenoid rim.
