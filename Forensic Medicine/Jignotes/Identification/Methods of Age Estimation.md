# [[Identification]] > Methods of Age Estimation

### **General Considerations**

Determination of age is a vital part of establishing the **[[Identity]]** of a living person or a dead body. It is required for both civil (marriage, employment, voting) and criminal purposes (rape, kidnapping, juvenile delinquency, criminal responsibility).

The methods of age estimation are broadly classified into:
1.  **Physical Examination** (Morphological features)
2.  **Dental Examination** ([[Forensic Odontology]])
3.  **Radiological/Skeletal Examination** ([[Ossification Centers]])

---

### **1. Physical Examination**

This is essentially an inspection of external features. It is useful for a general assessment but lacks precision.

*   **Height and Weight:** Comparison with standard anthropometric charts (less reliable due to nutritional/genetic variations).
*   **Secondary Sexual Characteristics:**
    *   **Pubic Hair:** Appearance and texture.
    *   **Axillary Hair:** Usually appears after pubic hair.
    *   **Males:** Deepening of voice, Adam's apple prominence, facial hair (beard/moustache).
    *   **Females:** Breast development, onset of menarche.
*   **Senile Changes (Old Age):**
    *   Greying of hair (can start around 40 years).
    *   Arcus senilis (corneal opacity, usually >40-60 years).
    *   Wrinkling of skin (especially face and neck).
    *   Loss of teeth and alveolar absorption.

### **2. Dental Examination**

Teeth provide a fairly accurate estimate of age up to 25 years. Methods differ for children and adults.

#### **A. Eruption of Teeth**
There are two sets of dentition: Temporary (Deciduous/Milk) and Permanent.

| Dentition Phase | Age Range | Key Events |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Temporary Teeth** | 6 months – 2.5 years | Erupts from Lower Central Incisor (6–8 months) to 2nd Molar (2–2.5 years). |
| **Mixed Dentition** | 6 – 11 years | Presence of both milk and permanent teeth. |
| **Permanent Teeth** | 6 – 25 years | Eruption sequence is vital. |

**Eruption Sequence of Permanent Teeth:**
*   **6 years:** First Molar (M1) – *First permanent tooth to erupt.*
*   **7 years:** Central Incisor.
*   **8 years:** Lateral Incisor.
*   **9 years:** First Premolar.
*   **10 years:** Second Premolar.
*   **11 years:** Canine.
*   **12 years:** Second Molar (M2).
*   **17–25 years:** Third Molar (Wisdom Tooth).

> **Mnemonic for Permanent Eruption:**
> **MAMA Is In Pain, Papa Can Make Medicine**
> (M1, I1, I2, P1, P2, C, M2, M3) — roughly corresponds to ages 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17-25.

#### **B. Age Estimation in Adults (>25 Years): Gustafson’s Method**
Used for age estimation from a single tooth (preferably anterior) after 25 years. It evaluates six regressive changes.

**The Six Criteria (Mnemonic: A Public Servant Can Retire Tomorrow):**
1.  **A**ttrition (Wearing down of incisal/occlusal surface).
2.  **P**eriodontosis (Gum recession/loosening).
3.  **S**econdary Dentin (Deposition in pulp cavity).
4.  **C**ementum apposition (Thickening at the root).
5.  **R**oot Resorption (At the apex).
6.  **T**ransparency of Root (Most reliable criteria; due to mineralization of dentinal tubules).

*   **Scoring:** Each factor is given a score of 0 to 3.
*   **Formula:** Age = $11.02 + (4.56 \times Total Score) \pm 3.63$ years.

#### **C. Other Dental Methods**
*   **Stack's Method:** Used in infants (measuring weight and height of developing teeth).
*   **Boyde's Method:** Counts incremental lines of enamel (neonatal lines).
*   **Miles' Method:** Based on attrition of molars.

### **3. Radiological (Skeletal) Examination**

This is the most scientifically accepted method for age estimation between the years of **14 to 25**. It relies on the appearance of ossification centers and the fusion of epiphysis with diaphysis.

#### **A. Appearance of Ossification Centers (Carpal Bones)**
Useful in children.
*   **Capitate:** 2 months
*   **Hamate:** 3 months
*   **Triquetral:** 3 years
*   **Lunate:** 4 years
*   **Scaphoid:** 5 years
*   **Trapezium:** 5-6 years
*   **Trapezoid:** 5-6 years
*   **Pisiform:** 9-12 years

> **Mnemonic:** **S**he **L**ooks **T**oo **P**retty **T**ry **T**o **C**atch **H**er (Scaphoid, Lunate, Triquetrum, Pisiform, Trapezium, Trapezoid, Capitate, Hamate) — *Note: The mnemonic is for anatomy order, not ossification order. Remember Capitate is first (Capital/Captain comes first).*

#### **B. Fusion of Epiphysis (Key Medicolegal Ages)**
The "Rule of Fusion" generally follows the elbow-wrist-shoulder sequence.

| Joint/Bone | Fusion Event | Approximate Age |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Elbow** | Fusion of lower end humerus, upper radius/ulna | **14–16 years** |
| **Wrist** | Lower end of Radius and Ulna | **18–19 years** |
| **Shoulder** | Head of Humerus | **18–20 years** |
| **Hip** | Iliac Crest | **20–21 years** |
| **Clavicle** | Sternal (Medial) End | **21–22 years** (ranges up to 25) |
| **Sacrum** | Fusion of sacral vertebrae | **> 25 years** |

### **4. Methods for Age > 25 Years (Adults)**

Once all epiphyses have fused (by ~25 years), age estimation becomes difficult and relies on degenerative changes.

#### **A. Skull Suture Closure**
Examination of the ectocranial (outer) and endocranial (inner) surfaces. Fusion usually moves posterior to anterior.
*   **Sagittal Suture:** Begins fusing at 25-30 years.
*   **Coronal Suture:** Begins at 40 years.
*   **Lambdoid Suture:** Begins at 40-45 years.
*   *Note:* Suture closure is highly variable and erratic; not a very reliable method alone.

#### **B. Pubic Symphysis Changes**
*   **Todd’s Method / McKern & Stewart:** Examines the surface of the pubic symphysis.
    *   **Young:** Ridged and furrowed (billowing).
    *   **Old:** Smooth, rimmed, and depressed.

#### **C. Sternum**
*   **Xiphoid process fuses with body:** ~40 years.
*   **Manubrium fuses with body:** ~60 years (variable).

#### **D. Lipping of Vertebrae**
*   Osteophytes (lipping) appear on the borders of vertebral bodies after 40-45 years.

### **5. Fetal Age Estimation**

Used in cases of abortion, infanticide, or stillbirth.

#### **A. [[Hasse's Rule]]**
Used to estimate fetal age from Crown-Heel length (CHL).
*   **First 5 months:** Length (cm) = $\sqrt{Month}$
    *   *Example:* 16 cm length $\rightarrow$ $\sqrt{16} = 4$ months.
*   **Last 5 months:** Length (cm) = $Month \times 5$
    *   *Example:* 30 cm length $\rightarrow$ $30/5 = 6$ months.

#### **B. Ossification Centers in Fetus**
*   **Calcaneum:** 5th month of intrauterine life (IUL).
*   **Talus:** 7th month IUL.
*   **Lower end of Femur:** 9th month IUL (indicates viability/full term).
*   **Upper end of Tibia:** 9th month IUL (at birth).

### **Medico-Legal Aspects of Age Estimation**

1.  **Consent:**
    *   **Civil cases/Victim:** Informed written consent is mandatory.
    *   **Accused:** Consent not required if requested by police officer not below rank of Sub-Inspector (Section 53 CrPC), but force should not be used.
2.  **Margin of Error:**
    *   Medical age is an **estimate**, not a precise date.
    *   Generally, a margin of **± 2 years** is allowed in opinion.
3.  **Benefit of Doubt:** In criminal cases, the benefit of the margin of error goes to the accused (the lower age limit is usually accepted to favor the accused in juvenile pleas).
4.  **Important Legal Ages (India):**
    *   **< 7 years:** No criminal responsibility (Doli Incapax - Sec 82 IPC).
    *   **7 - 12 years:** Partial criminal responsibility (Doli Capax - Sec 83 IPC).
    *   **12 years:** Consent for medical examination not valid (guardian required).
    *   **16 years (Males):** Age limit for kidnapping.
    *   **18 years (Females):** Age limit for kidnapping; Age of consent for sex (POCSO/IPC); Age of majority.
    *   **18 years:** Juvenile Justice Act cut-off.
