# [[Firearms And Ballistics]] > Characteristics of Firearm Wounds

### General Considerations
[[Wound ballistics]] involves the study of the effects of a projectile on the human body. Firearm injuries are classified into **Entrance Wounds** (In-shot) and **Exit Wounds** (Out-shot). The appearance depends heavily on the type of firearm ([[Rifled firearm]] vs [[Shotgun]]), the distance of firing, and the anatomical site involved.

### Characteristics of Entry Wounds (Rifled Firearms)

The wound of entrance is the point where the projectile penetrates the body. Its characteristics vary significantly based on the range of fire.

#### 1. General Features (Distant Shot)
When the weapon is discharged from a distance beyond the range of flame, smoke, and powder deposition (usually > 1-2 yards), the wound presents with:
*   **Size:** Generally **smaller** than the diameter of the bullet (due to skin elasticity).
*   **Shape:** Circular (if hit at 90°) or Oval (if hit obliquely).
*   **Margins:** **Inverted** (turned inward).
*   **[[Abrasion Collar]] (Abrasion Ring):** A reddish-brown, abraded rim surrounding the hole caused by the friction and heat of the spinning bullet. It indicates the direction of fire (concentric = perpendicular; eccentric/elliptical = oblique).
*   **[[Grease Collar]] (Dirt Collar):** A dark ring on the inner edge of the abrasion collar caused by the bullet wiping off grease, rust, or lead lubricant on the skin. This is the **"Bullet Wipe"**.

#### 2. Range-Specific Features (Near/Close/Contact)
In addition to the physical defect, products of combustion create specific signs:

*   **Contact Shot (Muzzle pressed against skin):**
    *   **Tight Contact:** Muzzle impression (stamped abrasion) may be seen. The wound may be **stellate** (star-shaped) or cruciate if over bone (e.g., forehead) due to gas expansion blowing the tissues outward against the bone.
    *   **Color:** The track and surrounding tissues may appear **Cherry Red** due to the formation of [[Carboxyhemoglobin]] from carbon monoxide in the muzzle gases.
    *   **Tissue:** No burning or tattooing externally as gases enter the wound track.
*   **Close Shot (Within flame range):**
    *   **Scorching/Singeing:** Effects of flame/hot gases. Hair is burnt/curled.
    *   **Blackening (Smudging):** Deposition of smoke/soot. This can be wiped off.
*   **Near Shot (Within powder range):**
    *   **[[Tattooing]] (Stippling):** Unburnt or semi-burnt gunpowder particles embed into the dermis. These **cannot** be wiped off. They appear as multiple reddish-brown punctate abrasions.

### Characteristics of Entry Wounds (Shotguns)

Shotguns fire multiple pellets. The wound pattern depends on the dispersion of pellets (which increases with range).

1.  **Contact/Close Range:** Creates a massive, single circular/irregular hole (Rat-hole entry). Wads and cards are found inside the wound.
2.  **Intermediate Range (1–3 meters):** Central hole with scalloped margins ("Rat-nibbling").
3.  **Distant Range (> 4 meters):** Central hole disappears. Multiple small, separate pellet holes are seen ("Satellite pellets").

### Characteristics of Exit Wounds

The exit wound is formed by the projectile leaving the body.
*   **Size:** Usually **larger** and more irregular than the entry wound (due to bullet deformation or tumbling).
*   **Shape:** Star-shaped (stellate), slit-like, or irregular.
*   **Margins:** **Everted** (turned outward).
*   **Absence of Collars:** No abrasion collar, grease collar, or burning/blackening/tattooing (unless it is a contact wound with very thin tissue).
*   **Exceptions:**
    *   **[[Shored Exit Wound]]:** If the exit site is supported by tight clothing, a belt, or a wall/floor, the skin is slapped against the support, creating a false abrasion collar. This mimics an entry wound.

### Firearm Wounds on the Skull (Beveling)

The skull bone behaves like a sandwich of brittle tables.
*   **Entry Wound:**
    *   **Outer Table:** Clean, punched-out hole.
    *   **Inner Table:** Larger, crater-like defect (Internal Beveling/Cone-ing).
*   **Exit Wound:**
    *   **Inner Table:** Clean hole.
    *   **Outer Table:** Larger, crater-like defect (External Beveling).

### Differences Between Entry and Exit Wounds

| Feature | Entrance Wound (In-shot) | Exit Wound (Out-shot) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Size** | Usually smaller than the bullet diameter | Usually larger and irregular |
| **Edges** | **Inverted** (turned in) | **Everted** (turned out) |
| **Abrasion Collar** | **Present** (Pathognomonic) | Absent (except in Shored exit) |
| **Grease Collar** | **Present** (Bullet wipe) | Absent |
| **Burning/Blackening** | Present in close/contact shots | Absent |
| **Tattooing** | Present in near shots | Absent |
| **Bleeding** | Generally less | Generally more profuse |
| **Tissue/Fat** | Not protruding | Fat/tags may protrude |
| **Clothing Fibers** | Turned inward (into the wound) | Turned outward |
| **Skull Bone** | **Internal Beveling** (Inner table crater) | **External Beveling** (Outer table crater) |

### Special Phenomena & Medicolegal Aspects

*   **[[Kennedy Phenomenon]]:** Surgical alteration (suturing/extension) of a gunshot wound that makes it difficult to distinguish entry from exit during autopsy.
*   **Rayalaseema Phenomenon:** In bomb blasts or high-velocity injuries, identification of entry/exit is obscured due to massive tissue destruction.
*   **[[Ricochet Bullet]]:** A bullet that rebounds off a hard surface before hitting the victim. It enters deformed/tumbling, causing a large, irregular entry wound without an abrasion collar (Key-hole defect).
*   **[[Tandem Bullet]] (Piggyback):** Two bullets entering through the same hole (due to a previous bullet lodged in the barrel being pushed by the next).
*   **Souvenir Bullet:** A bullet retained in the body for a long time, encased in fibrous tissue.
*   **Odd-and-Even Rule:** If the number of wounds is even (e.g., 2), it suggests one entry and one exit (perforating). If odd (e.g., 1), the bullet is likely lodged inside (penetrating).

### Autopsy Findings & Evidence Preservation

*   **X-Ray:** Mandatory before autopsy to locate lodged bullets, fragments ("Lead snowstorm"), and bone fractures.
*   **Skin Excision:** The skin surrounding the entry and exit wounds should be excised (preserving the margins) and stored in **rectified spirit** for histopathological/chemical analysis.
*   **Bullet Recovery:** Use rubber-tipped forceps or fingers to avoid scratching rifling marks (which are crucial for weapon identification).
*   **Clothing:** Do not cut through bullet holes. Air dry wet bloody clothes before packing in paper bags (not plastic) to prevent fungal growth.

**Mnemonics for Range Characteristics:**
*   **C**ontact = **C**herry red tissue / **C**ross shape (stellate).
*   **C**lose = **C**harring (Burning) / **C**arbon (Blackening).
*   **N**ear = **N**itrates (unburnt powder) causing **T**attooing.
