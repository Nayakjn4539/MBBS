# [[NUTRITION AND HEALTH]] > Parboiled rice is nutritionally superior to milled rice

### Parboiled Rice: Nutritional Superiority

**Parboiling** (partial cooking in steam) is an ancient Indian technique of preserving the nutritive quality of rice. It is considered nutritionally superior to raw milled (polished) rice due to specific biochemical changes that occur during the processing of the [[paddy]].

#### 1. The Process (Hot Soaking Process)
The technique recommended by the **Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), Mysore**, involves the following steps:
1.  **Soaking:** Unhusked rice (paddy) is soaked in hot water at **65–70°C** for 3–4 hours.
2.  **Steaming:** The soaked paddy is steamed for 5–10 minutes.
3.  **Drying:** The paddy is dried.
4.  **Milling:** The dried paddy is finally milled or home-pounded.

#### 2. Mechanism of Nutritional Retention
The superiority arises from the physiological changes occurring during the steaming and soaking phases:
*   **Migration of Nutrients:** The [[water-soluble vitamins]] (B-complex) and minerals present in the outer **pericarp** and **aleurone layer** are dissolved and driven into the inner [[endosperm]] (starchy core).
*   **Fixation:** The starch gets **gelatinized**, sealing the nutrients inside the grain.
*   **Adhesion:** The germ (embryo) and the scutellum (rich in B vitamins) get attached more firmly to the grain and are not easily removed during milling.

#### 3. Comparison: Milled Rice vs. Parboiled Rice

| Feature | Raw Milled (Polished) Rice | Parboiled Rice |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nutrient Location** | Nutrients concentrated in outer layer (removed during milling). | Nutrients infused into the core (retained after milling). |
| **Thiamine (Vit B1)** | **Low** (approx 0.06–0.11 mg%). Heavily lost during milling. | **High** (approx 0.21–0.27 mg%). Retained due to inward migration. |
| **Protein** | Lower (approx 6.8 g%). | Higher (approx 8.5 g%). |
| **Niacin & Riboflavin** | Significant loss (up to 60%). | Significantly conserved. |
| **Grain Hardness** | Brittle; breaks easily. | **Harder**; resistant to insect invasion. |
| **Digestibility** | Easily digested. | Slightly harder to digest but better keeping quality. |

*Note: Values are approximate per 100g.*

#### 4. Advantages of Parboiling
*   **Nutritional Conservation:** Even if the rice is milled to a high degree subsequently, the nutrients are **not removed** because they have penetrated the kernel.
*   **Resistance to Washing Losses:** In India, rice is often washed multiple times before cooking. Raw rice loses up to 60% of water-soluble vitamins during washing. [[Parboiled rice]] is harder and has a gelatinized surface, preventing the leaching out of vitamins during washing and cooking.
*   **Storage:** The heat treatment hardens the grain, making it more resistant to **insect invasion** and suitable for long-term storage.
*   **Yield:** There is less breakage during milling, resulting in a higher yield of head rice.

#### 5. Disadvantages
*   **Off-flavour:** A peculiar smell or "off flavour" may develop, which some consumers do not relish.
*   **Colour:** The grain may appear slightly yellowish or brownish, unlike the pearly white of polished rice.

#### 6. Clinical Relevance
*   **Prevention of [[Beriberi]]:** Populations consuming highly polished (white) rice are prone to **Thiamine (Vitamin B1)** deficiency, leading to Beriberi. Parboiled rice consumers are protected against this deficiency disease due to the retention of Thiamine.
*   **Dietary Recommendation:** Nutritionists advocate the use of parboiled or under-milled rice over refined white rice to ensure adequate intake of B-complex vitamins.
