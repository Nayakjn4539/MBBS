# [[Infections Of Bone]] > Acute Osteomyelitis

### Acute Hematogenous Osteomyelitis

**Acute Hematogenous Osteomyelitis** is a rapidly progressing [[suppurative infection]] of the [[bone]] and [[bone marrow]] caused by [[pyogenic bacteria]]. It primarily affects the rapidly growing ends of long bones in children.

#### Etiology and Predisposing Factors
*   **Causative Organism:** [[Staphylococcus aureus]] is the most common organism (approx. 90%).
    *   Other pathogens: [[Streptococcus pyogenes]], [[Haemophilus influenzae]] (in children < 4 years), [[Salmonella]] (in [[Sickle cell anemia]]), [[Pseudomonas]] (in IV drug abusers).
*   **Route of Entry:** Usually hematogenous (blood-borne) from a distant focus (e.g., tonsillitis, pyoderma, umbilicus infection).
*   **Predisposing Factors:** Trauma (local injury causes hematoma which acts as culture medium), malnutrition, and immunodeficiency.

### Pathogenesis

The pathogenesis is a cascade of events involving vascular stasis, inflammation, pressure buildup, and bone necrosis.

#### 1. Site of Origin: The Metaphysis
The infection almost invariably begins in the [[metaphysis]] of long bones (e.g., distal [[femur]], proximal [[tibia]]).
**Why Metaphysis?**
*   **Vascular Loop:** The terminal branches of the [[nutrient artery]] form a "hair-pin" loop near the [[growth plate]].
*   **Vascular Stasis:** Blood flow is sluggish and turbulent in these large sinusoidal veins, allowing bacteria to settle.
*   **Defective Phagocytosis:** The endothelial lining here has gaps and is deficient in phagocytic cells (macrophages).
*   **Trauma:** Minor trauma causes microscopic hemorrhage/hematoma, providing an ideal culture medium for bacteria.

#### 2. The Inflammatory Cycle
1.  **Colonization:** Bacteria lodge in the vascular loops and multiply.
2.  **Acute Inflammation:** An inflammatory exudate (pus) forms within the rigid bony walls.
3.  **Increased Pressure:** Unlike soft tissues, bone cannot expand. This leads to a rapid rise in [[intraosseous pressure]].
4.  **Vascular Occlusion:** The pressure compresses blood vessels, and bacterial enzymes cause infective [[thrombosis]] of [[Haversian canals]] and [[Volkmann's canals]].
5.  **Bone Necrosis:** The cut-off blood supply leads to death of the bone tissue.

#### 3. Spread of Pus
Once pus forms, it spreads along the path of least resistance:
*   **Medullary Spread:** Pus travels along the medullary cavity.
*   **Subperiosteal Spread (Most Common):** Pus tracks through the [[Volkmann's canals]] to the surface of the cortex, lifting the [[periosteum]] to form a [[subperiosteal abscess]]. This further deprives the bone of its periosteal blood supply.
*   **Soft Tissue:** The periosteum may rupture, releasing pus into muscle and subcutaneous tissue (forming a sinus).
*   **Joint Involvement:** Rare in older children because the [[growth plate]] acts as a barrier and the capsule attaches below the metaphysis. However, it can occur in specific anatomical locations (see below).

#### Spread Patterns Based on Age
The anatomy of the vascular supply changes with age, altering the spread of infection.

| Age Group | Vascular Anatomy | Spread Pattern | Clinical Consequence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Infant** (< 1 year) | Vessels penetrate through the [[growth plate]] into the [[epiphysis]]. | Infection spreads easily from metaphysis to epiphysis and into the joint. | High risk of [[Septic Arthritis]] and permanent growth damage. |
| **Child** (1–16 years) | [[Growth plate]] acts as a barrier (avascular). | Infection stays in metaphysis and spreads to [[subperiosteal space]]. | Large [[Subperiosteal Abscess]]; [[Septic Arthritis]] is rare unless metaphysis is intra-articular. |
| **Adult** (> 16 years) | [[Growth plate]] is fused; vascular connection re-established between metaphysis and epiphysis. | Infection can spread anywhere; [[Periosteum]] is firmly adherent. | Subperiosteal abscess is rare; often presents as [[Spondylodiscitis]] (vertebral infection). |

**Clinical Implication:** In joints where the [[metaphysis]] is **intra-articular** (enclosed within the joint capsule), a metaphyseal abscess can burst directly into the joint causing [[Septic Arthritis]].
*   **Examples:** Upper [[humerus]] (Shoulder), Upper [[femur]] (Hip), Lateral distal [[humerus]] (Elbow).

### Pathological Features: The "Dead and New" Bone

The interplay between bone destruction and bone repair creates specific pathological entities visible on X-ray and during surgery.

#### 1. Sequestrum (The Dead Bone)
*   **Definition:** A piece of dead bone surrounded by infected [[granulation tissue]] and separated from the living bone.
*   **Mechanism:** Formed due to isolation of bone from its blood supply (both endosteal supply via nutrient artery and periosteal supply via periosteal stripping).
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   It is avascular, lighter in weight, and brittle.
    *   On X-ray, it appears **denser** (sclerotic) than surrounding bone because:
        1.  It does not undergo decalcification (hyperemia causes osteoporosis in living bone, but blood cannot reach the sequestrum to remove calcium).
        2.  Surrounding living bone becomes osteoporotic.
*   **Fate:** Small sequestra may be absorbed by osteoclasts (creeping substitution) or discharged through a sinus. Large sequestra persist and perpetuate chronic infection.

#### Types of Sequestrum

| Type of Sequestrum | Associated Condition/Characteristic |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tubular / Diaphyseal** | Acute [[Pyogenic Osteomyelitis]] (often massive, involving whole shaft). |
| **Ring Sequestrum** | Infection around [[Pin tract]] (External fixators/skeletal traction) or amputation stump. |
| **Feathery / Sandy** | [[Tuberculosis]] of bone (also called Rice grain). |
| **Ivory Sequestrum** | [[Syphilis]] (Bone is dense/sclerotic). |
| **Black Sequestrum** | [[Fungal Osteomyelitis]] (e.g., Actinomycosis). |
| **Coke Sequestrum** | [[Cancellous bone]] infection. |

**Mnemonic for Sequestra:**
*   **T**ubular = **T**ypical Pyogenic
*   **R**ing = **R**ods/Pins
*   **F**eathery = **T**B (Think of a bird in a TB sanatorium)
*   **I**vory = **S**yphilis (IS)
*   **B**lack = **F**ungal (Black Fungus)

#### 2. Involucrum (The New Bone)
*   **Definition:** A sheath of new subperiosteal bone formed around the [[sequestrum]].
*   **Mechanism:** The stripped [[periosteum]] (which retains its osteogenic potential) lays down new bone in an attempt to wall off the infection and maintain structural integrity.
*   **Appearance:** It looks irregular, rough, and thickened. It eventually creates a "coffin" encasing the dead bone.

#### 3. Cloaca
*   **Definition:** An opening or perforation in the [[involucrum]].
*   **Function:** It allows the discharge of [[pus]] and small [[bony spicules]] (sequestra) from the bone into the soft tissues/sinus tract.

### Summary of Pathological Progression

1.  **Day 1-2:** Inflammation, edema, increased pressure. X-rays are normal.
2.  **Day 2-10:** Pus formation, [[subperiosteal abscess]].
3.  **Day 10-14:** Vascular thrombosis leading to bone death ([[Sequestrum]] formation).
4.  **Week 2+:** Periosteal new bone formation ([[Involucrum]]).
5.  **Chronic Phase:** If untreated, the cycle of pus drainage through [[cloaca]] and [[sinus]] continues, with the sequestrum acting as a foreign body.
