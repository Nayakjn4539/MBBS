# [[Upper Limb]] > Shaft of Humerus Fracture

### Introduction and Anatomy
The shaft of the [[humerus]] extends from the upper border of the pectoralis major insertion proximally to the supracondylar ridge distally.
*   **Shape:** The bone is cylindrical in the proximal half and becomes triangular (prismatic) in the distal half.
*   **Compartments:** Two intermuscular septa (medial and lateral) divide the arm into:
    *   **Anterior Compartment:** Contains biceps brachii, coracobrachialis, brachialis, and neurovascular bundle ([[brachial artery]], [[median nerve]], [[ulnar nerve]]).
    *   **Posterior Compartment:** Contains triceps and the [[radial nerve]].
*   **Radial Groove:** The [[radial nerve]] winds around the posterior aspect of the humerus in the spiral groove, making it highly susceptible to injury in mid-shaft and distal-third fractures.

### Mechanism of Injury
Fractures can occur due to direct or indirect trauma:
*   **Direct Trauma:** Usually high-energy injuries (e.g., RTA, assault). Often results in **transverse** or **comminuted** fractures.
*   **Indirect Trauma:** Fall on an outstretched hand or twisting injuries (e.g., arm wrestling). Often results in **spiral** or **oblique** fractures.
*   **Pathological:** The humerus is a common site for metastasis (breast, lung, kidney) or bone cysts. Trivial trauma causes fracture.

### Clinical Features
*   **Pain and Swelling:** Severe pain, bruising, and swelling in the arm.
*   **Deformity:** Obvious deformity and shortening may be present.
*   **Abnormal Mobility and Crepitus:** Felt on palpation (avoid eliciting intentionally to prevent pain/nerve injury).
*   **Loss of Function:** Patient supports the injured arm with the other hand.
*   **Neurological Assessment:** Crucial to test for [[radial nerve injury]] (check for wrist drop and sensation in the first dorsal web space) before and after manipulation.

### Displacement and Deforming Forces
The displacement of fracture fragments depends on the level of the fracture relative to muscle insertions.

| Fracture Level | Deforming Muscle Forces | Displacement Pattern |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Proximal to Pectoralis Major** | Proximal fragment: Rotator cuff<br>Distal fragment: Pectoralis major | Proximal: Abducted & Rotated<br>Distal: Adducted |
| **Between Pectoralis Major and Deltoid** | Proximal fragment: Pectoralis major<br>Distal fragment: Deltoid | Proximal: Adducted<br>Distal: Pulled proximally (shortening) |
| **Distal to Deltoid Insertion** | Proximal fragment: Deltoid<br>Distal fragment: Biceps/Triceps | Proximal: Abducted<br>Distal: Pulled proximally (shortening) |

### Imaging
*   **X-rays:** Anteroposterior (AP) and Lateral views of the entire humerus.
*   **Rule of Twos:** Must include the joint above ([[shoulder joint]]) and the joint below ([[elbow joint]]) to rule out associated dislocations or fractures.

### Management
The humerus has a rich blood supply and is surrounded by a thick muscle envelope, leading to high union rates. Therefore, **conservative management is the treatment of choice** for most isolated fractures.

#### 1. Conservative Management
*   **U-Slab (Coaptation Splint):** Used initially for stabilization. The slab goes from the axilla, around the elbow, and up to the shoulder.
*   **Hanging Cast:** utilizes the weight of the cast to provide traction and alignment.
    *   *Constraint:* Patient must remain upright/semi-sitting (even while sleeping) to maintain traction.
    *   *Risk:* Heavy casts can cause distraction and non-union.
*   **Functional Bracing (Sarmiento Brace):** Applied after the acute pain/swelling subsides (usually 1–2 weeks). It compresses the soft tissues to align the bone while allowing shoulder and elbow motion.
*   **Acceptable Reduction Criteria:**
    *   < 20° Anterior/Posterior angulation.
    *   < 30° Varus/Valgus angulation.
    *   < 3 cm shortening.

#### 2. Operative Management
Surgery is indicated when conservative methods fail or specific complications exist.

**Indications for Surgery:**
*   **Absolute:**
    *   Open fractures.
    *   Vascular injury requiring repair.
    *   Brachial plexus injury.
    *   [[Floating elbow]] (ipsilateral forearm and humerus fracture).
    *   Compartment syndrome.
*   **Relative:**
    *   Polytrauma (to facilitate nursing/mobilization).
    *   Pathological fractures.
    *   Failed conservative treatment (interposition of soft tissue).
    *   Bilateral humerus fractures.
    *   Holstein-Lewis fracture with radial nerve palsy (controversial, often observed first).

**Surgical Methods:**
*   **Plate Osteosynthesis (ORIF):**
    *   Uses **DCP** (Dynamic Compression Plate) or **LCP** (Locking Compression Plate).
    *   *Advantage:* Rigid fixation, direct visualization of the radial nerve.
    *   *Disadvantage:* Extensive soft tissue stripping, risk of iatrogenic nerve injury.
*   **Intramedullary Nailing (IMN):**
    *   Can be Antegrade (from shoulder) or Retrograde (from elbow).
    *   *Advantage:* Load sharing, smaller incisions, useful in pathological/osteoporotic bone.
    *   *Disadvantage:* Shoulder pain/stiffness (antegrade), risk of rotator cuff damage.
*   **External Fixation:** Used for severe open fractures with soft tissue loss or damage control orthopedics.

### Complications

#### 1. Radial Nerve Injury (Wrist Drop)
*   **Incidence:** Occurs in 10–18% of shaft fractures.
*   **Mechanism:** Traction, entrapment, or laceration.
*   **Holstein-Lewis Fracture:** A spiral fracture of the distal 1/3rd of the humerus where the [[radial nerve]] is entrapped by the lateral intermuscular septum.
*   **Management:**
    *   *Closed Fracture:* Expectant management. The nerve is usually neuropraxic (concussion). Monitor clinically and with EMG/NCV. Recovery takes 3–4 months. Use a **Cock-up splint** (dynamic or static) to prevent contractures.
    *   *Indications to Explore:* Open fractures, nerve palsy *after* manipulation, no recovery after 3–4 months.

#### 2. Vascular Injury
*   Injury to the [[brachial artery]] is rare but an emergency.
*   Signs: Absent pulse, expanding hematoma, ischemia.

#### 3. Non-Union
*   **Causes:** Distraction (heavy hanging cast), soft tissue interposition, inadequate immobilization, infection.
*   **Treatment:** Open reduction, rigid internal fixation (plating), and bone grafting.

#### 4. Malunion
*   Common but usually functionally well-tolerated due to the wide range of motion at the shoulder and elbow.
*   **Cubitus Varus** is *not* a complication of shaft fractures (it is a complication of supracondylar fractures).

### Clinical Mnemonics
**Indications for Surgery in Humerus Fracture: "NO CAST"**
*   **N**on-union
*   **O**pen fracture
*   **C**omplicated (Neurovascular)
*   **A**ssociated injuries (Floating elbow, Polytrauma)
*   **S**egmental fracture
*   **T**umor (Pathological)
