# [[Diseases Of Eyelids]] > Trichiasis and Distichiasis

# Trichiasis

### Definition
**Trichiasis** refers to the inward misdirection of [[cilia]] (eyelashes) which rub against the [[eyeball]], while the position of the [[lid margin]] remains normal. 

*   **Pseudotrichiasis:** This term describes the inward turning of lashes secondary to the inward turning of the eyelid margin itself, a condition known as [[entropion]].

### Etiology
Common causes leading to trichiasis include conditions that cause scarring or distortion of the lid margin:
*   **[[Trachoma]] (Cicatrizing):** A leading cause, where scarring leads to misdirection.
*   **[[Ulcerative blepharitis]]:** Chronic inflammation of the lid margin.
*   **Healed [[membranous conjunctivitis]].**
*   **Healed [[hordeolum externum]] (Stye).**
*   **Trauma:** Mechanical injuries, chemical or thermal burns.
*   **Operative scars:** Scarring on the lid margin following surgery.
*   **[[Stevens-Johnson syndrome]]:** Late stage cicatrization.

### Clinical Features
**Symptoms**
Patients typically present with symptoms caused by the mechanical abrasion of the cornea and conjunctiva:
*   **Foreign body sensation** (most common).
*   **[[Photophobia]]** (sensitivity to light).
*   **Lacrimation** (watering).
*   **Pain** and irritation.
*   **[[Blepharospasm]]:** Reflex closure of eyelids due to corneal irritation.

**Signs**
*   One or more misdirected cilia touching the [[cornea]] or [[conjunctiva]].
*   **Reflex blepharospasm** may be present.
*   **Conjunctival congestion**.
*   Signs of the causative disease (e.g., [[Arlt's line]] in trachoma, scales/crusts in blepharitis).

### Complications
If left untreated, persistent rubbing of lashes can lead to:
1.  Recurrent **[[corneal abrasions]]**.
2.  Superficial **[[corneal opacities]]**.
3.  **[[Corneal vascularization]]**.
4.  Non-healing **[[corneal ulcer]]**.

### Treatment
The management depends on the number of misdirected lashes.

| Modality | Description | Indication/Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Epilation]]** | Mechanical removal of lashes using [[epilation forceps]]. | Temporary measure. Recurrence occurs within **3–4 weeks**. |
| **[[Electrolysis]]** | Destruction of the lash follicle using electric current. A fine needle is inserted into the root, and **2 mA** current is passed for **10 seconds**. The loosened lash is then removed. | Suitable for a few misdirected lashes. Requires local [[infiltration anaesthesia]]. |
| **[[Cryoepilation]]** (Cryotherapy) | Application of a **[[cryoprobe]]** (-20°C) to the external lid margin for **20–25 seconds** using a double freeze-thaw technique. | Effective for eliminating lashes but causes **depigmentation** of the skin (cosmetic disadvantage in dark-skinned individuals). |
| **Radiofrequency Epilation** | Removal of lashes using radiofrequency energy. | Used for a few misdirected cilia. |
| **Surgical Correction** | Operative procedures similar to those used for [[cicatricial entropion]]. | Indicated when **many cilia** are misdirected. |
| **Argon Laser** | Laser ablation of the follicle. | Alternative method for few lashes. |

# Distichiasis

### Definition
**Distichiasis** is a rare anomaly characterized by the presence of an **extra posterior row of eyelashes**. These abnormal lashes occupy the position of the [[Meibomian glands]].

*   Normally, Meibomian glands open at the posterior lid margin; in distichiasis, these glands differentiate into hair follicles.

### Classification and Etiology

**1. Congenital Distichiasis**
*   Rare congenital anomaly.
*   The extra row of cilia replaces the Meibomian glands.
*   These cilia are usually directed backwards towards the cornea.

**2. Acquired Distichiasis (Metaplastic Lashes)**
*   Occurs due to **metaplasia** where Meibomian glands transform into hair follicles.
*   **Causes:** Late stages of severe cicatrizing conjunctivitis such as:
    *   **[[Stevens-Johnson syndrome]]**.
    *   **[[Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid]]**.
    *   **Chemical injuries/burns**.

### Clinical Features
*   Similar to trichiasis, causing irritation, foreign body sensation, and potential corneal damage due to the posterior location of the lashes rubbing against the eye surface.

### Treatment
*   **Epilation:** Temporary relief.
*   **[[Cryotherapy]] (Cryoepilation):** Definitive treatment for the lash base.
*   **[[Electrolysis]]:** For individual lashes.
*   **Surgical Excision:** Division of the lid (lamellar split) and excision of the posterior lamella containing the abnormal follicles followed by graft reconstruction may be required in severe cases.

### Key Differences: Trichiasis vs. Distichiasis vs. Entropion

| Feature | **[[Trichiasis]]** | **[[Distichiasis]]** | **[[Entropion]]** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Anatomy** | Misdirection of normal lashes. | Extra posterior row of lashes (abnormal location). | Inward turning of the lid margin itself. |
| **Lid Margin Position** | **Normal**. | **Normal**. | **Inverted** (turned inward). |
| **Origin of Lashes** | Normal anterior lash line. | Orifices of **[[Meibomian glands]]** (Posterior lamella). | Normal anterior lash line. |
| **Primary Cause** | Cicatrization (e.g., **[[Trachoma]]**, Blepharitis). | Congenital or Metaplasia (SJS, OCP). | Involutional (senile), Cicatricial, Spastic. |
