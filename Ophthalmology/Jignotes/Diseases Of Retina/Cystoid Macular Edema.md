# [[Diseases Of Retina]] > Cystoid Macular Edema

# Cystoid Macular Edema (CME)

### Definition
**Cystoid Macular Edema ([[CME]])** is a painless disorder of the [[macula]] characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the **outer plexiform layer (Henle’s layer)** and the **inner nuclear layer** of the retina, centered around the [[foveola]]. This results in the formation of multiple cyst-like spaces.

### Pathogenesis
The fundamental pathology involves the breakdown of the **inner blood-retinal barrier** (leakage from retinal capillaries).
*   Fluid accumulates within the retinal layers.
*   The radial arrangement of the fibers in **Henle's layer** (outer plexiform layer) around the fovea dictates the characteristic pattern seen on angiography.
*   **Inflammatory mediators**, particularly **prostaglandins**, play a significant role, especially in post-operative cases.

### Etiology (Risk Factors)
The causes of CME are diverse. A useful mnemonic to remember the risk factors is **"RUN PRIDE"**.

**Mnemonic: RUN PRIDE**
*   **R** - [[Retinitis Pigmentosa]]
*   **U** - [[Uveitis]] (especially Intermediate Uveitis/Pars Planitis and Birdshot retinochoroidopathy)
*   **N** - **Nicotinic acid** / Niacin toxicity
*   **P** - **Prostaglandin analogues** (e.g., Latanoprost)
*   **R** - [[Retinal Vein Occlusion]] (CRVO/BRVO)
*   **I** - **Irvine-Gass Syndrome** (Post-cataract surgery CME)
*   **D** - [[Diabetic Retinopathy]]
*   **E** - **Epinephrine** (especially in aphakic eyes)

**Other Causes:**
*   **Vitreomacular traction** (VMT).
*   **Epiretinal membranes** (ERM).
*   **Choroidal tumors** (Melanoma, Hemangioma).

### Clinical Features
**Symptoms:**
*   **Painless** diminution of vision (usually minimal to moderate).
*   **Metamorphopsia** (distortion of vision).
*   **Positive scotoma** (a blind spot in the visual field).
*   If associated with inflammation, there may be photophobia or redness.

**Signs (Ophthalmoscopy):**
*   Loss of the foveal depression/contour.
*   Retinal thickening.
*   Yellowish spot at the center of the fovea.
*   In established cases, a typical **"Honey-comb appearance"** of the macula may be visible.

### Investigations

**1. Fundus Fluorescein Angiography ([[FFA]])**
*   **Appearance:** Characteristic **"Flower-petal"** or **"Petalloid"** pattern.
*   **Mechanism:** Leakage of dye from perifoveal capillaries leads to pooling in the cystoid spaces arranged radially in Henle's layer.
*   **Phases:** Leakage starts in the early phase and pooling increases in the late phase.

**2. Optical Coherence Tomography ([[OCT]])**
*   **Appearance:** Shows loss of foveal depression, retinal thickening, and **hyporeflective cystic spaces** (fluid-filled) in the intraretinal layers.
*   It is non-invasive and highly sensitive, comparable to FFA for detection.

**3. Photostress Test**
*   **Result:** Prolonged recovery time in macular diseases like CME, distinguishing it from optic nerve diseases.

### Differential Diagnosis: CME vs. CSR
It is crucial to differentiate [[Cystoid Macular Edema]] from [[Central Serous Retinopathy]] ([[CSR]]).

| Feature | Central Serous Retinopathy (CSR) | Cystoid Macular Edema (CME) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pathology** | Fluid in **subretinal space** due to [[RPE]] defect. | Fluid in **outer plexiform layer** (intraretinal). |
| **FFA Pattern** | **Ink blot** or **Smoke stack/Umbrella** appearance. | **Flower petal/Petalloid** appearance. |
| **OCT Finding** | Neurosensory detachment (subretinal fluid). | Intraretinal cystic spaces. |
| **Etiology** | Type A personality, Steroids. | Post-op, Diabetes, Uveitis, RP. |

### Clinical Implications: Irvine-Gass Syndrome
*   **Definition:** CME specifically occurring after **cataract surgery**.
*   **Timing:** Peak incidence is usually **6–10 weeks** post-operatively.
*   **Risk Factors:** Vitreous loss, vitreous incarceration in the wound, Anterior Chamber IOL ([[ACIOL]]), ruptured posterior capsule.
*   **Prophylaxis:** Use of topical **NSAIDs** (e.g., Nepafenac, Ketorolac) pre- and post-operatively can reduce incidence.

### Management
Treatment depends on the underlying etiology.

**1. Medical Management**
*   **Topical NSAIDs:** Drugs like **Ketorolac**, **Diclofenac**, or **Bromfenac** are effective, especially for pseudophakic CME.
*   **Corticosteroids:**
    *   **Topical/Periocular:** For inflammatory causes (Uveitis).
    *   **Intravitreal:** **Triamcinolone acetonide** (IVTA) or Dexamethasone implants (Ozurdex) for resistant cases.
*   **Systemic Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors ([[CAIs]]):** **Acetazolamide** is particularly beneficial for CME associated with **[[Retinitis Pigmentosa]]**.
*   **Anti-VEGF Agents:** Intravitreal injections (e.g., **Bevacizumab**, **Ranibizumab**) are used for CME secondary to vascular causes like [[Diabetic Retinopathy]] and [[CRVO]].

**2. Surgical Management**
*   **Nd:YAG Laser:** Used if vitreous strands are incarcerated in the wound (vitreolysis).
*   **Pars Plana Vitrectomy ([[PPV]]):** Indicated for:
    *   Vitreous traction on the macula.
    *   Removal of epiretinal membranes.
    *   Chronic cases unresponsive to medical therapy.
