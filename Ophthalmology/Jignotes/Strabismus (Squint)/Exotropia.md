# [[Strabismus (Squint)]] > Exotropia

# Exotropia (Divergent Squint)

### Definition
**Exotropia** is a form of [[Strabismus]] (squint) characterized by the **outward deviation** of one eye while the other eye fixates on an object. The visual axes diverge and do not meet at the point of fixation.

### Etiology and Risk Factors
*   **Refractive Error:** Most common in **myopes**. Uncorrected myopia results in less need for accommodation and subsequently less [[Accommodative Convergence]], predisposing to divergence.
*   **Sensory Deprivation:** Occurs when one eye loses vision (e.g., due to [[Cataract]], [[Corneal Opacity]], or [[Optic Atrophy]]). The eye drifts into the "position of rest," which is usually divergence in adults.
*   **Anatomical Factors:** Abnormalities in orbital shape or muscle insertion.
*   **Central Factors:** Deficient development of the fusion faculty.

### Classification of Exotropia

Exotropia can be classified based on onset, constancy, and the relationship between distance and near deviation.

#### 1. Based on Onset and Constancy
*   **Congenital Exotropia:**
    *   Rare; presents at birth or before 6 months of age.
    *   Characterized by a large, constant angle of deviation.
    *   Usually alternating with homonymous fixation in lateral gaze.
    *   Associated with high prevalence of neurological impairments.
*   **Primary Exotropia:**
    *   Typically appears between **2 to 5 years of age**.
    *   Often begins as **Intermittent Exotropia** and may progress to **Constant Exotropia** if untreated.
*   **Secondary (Sensory) Exotropia:**
    *   Constant unilateral deviation resulting from long-standing monocular lesions (e.g., trauma, cataract) leading to low vision.
*   **Consecutive Exotropia:**
    *   Results from surgical overcorrection of [[Esotropia]].

#### 2. Duane’s Classification (Based on Distance vs. Near Deviation)
This classification is critical for surgical planning. The difference between distance and near deviation must be at least **10 Prism Diopters (PD)**.

| Type | Definition | Clinical Feature |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Convergence Insufficiency Type** | Exotropia at **Near > Distance** | Often associated with asthenopia during near work. |
| **Divergence Excess Type** | Exotropia at **Distance > Near** | Often manifests when looking far away or daydreaming. |
| **Basic Type** | Exotropia at **Near ≈ Distance** | Deviation is roughly equal in all gazes. |

### Intermittent Exotropia
This is the **most common** type of exodeviation.

*   **Clinical Course:** The deviation is manifest at times (heterotropia) and latent at other times (heterophoria).
*   **Precipitating Factors:** The squint often becomes manifest during:
    *   Fatigue/Tiredness
    *   Ill health
    *   Daydreaming / Inattention
    *   Exposure to **bright light**.
*   **Sensory Status:** usually reveals good fusion, [[Stereopsis]], and no [[Amblyopia]] because the eyes are straight part of the time.
*   **Key Symptom:** **Closure of one eye in bright sunlight** is a classic sign. The mechanism is thought to be the avoidance of dazzling light which disrupts fusion.

**Clinical Implication:**
> If untreated, intermittent exotropia tends to decompensate into **Constant Exotropia**, leading to suppression and loss of binocular vision. Spontaneous cure is rare.

### Constant Exotropia
*   Can develop from decompensated intermittent exotropia or be constant from onset (rare).
*   **Suppression:** Usually well-developed to avoid [[Diplopia]].
*   **Amblyopia:** May be present if the deviation is unilateral; less common in alternating exotropia.
*   **Cosmesis:** Often the primary complaint in adults or older children.

### Clinical Evaluation

#### 1. History
*   Age of onset, duration, and progression.
*   History of closing one eye in bright light.
*   History of trauma or previous ocular surgery.

#### 2. Examination
*   **Visual Acuity:** To rule out amblyopia or sensory causes.
*   **Inspection:** Large deviations are obvious.
*   **Cover Tests:**
    *   **Cover Test:** Differentiates manifest squint (tropia) from latent (phoria). In exotropia, the uncovered eye moves **inward (adducts)** to take up fixation when the fixing eye is covered.
    *   **Alternate Cover Test:** Reveals the total deviation (latent + manifest).
*   **Measurement of Deviation:**
    *   **Prism Bar Cover Test (PBCT):** The standard method. Prisms are placed with the **Base IN** (towards the nose) to neutralize the outward deviation.
    *   **Hirschberg Test:** Corneal light reflex is displaced **nasally** (medial to the pupil center).
        *   Reflex at pupil margin $\approx$ 15° (30 PD).
        *   Reflex at limbus $\approx$ 45° (90 PD).
*   **Sensory Testing:** Worth 4-Dot test or [[Synoptophore]] to assess fusion and suppression.

### Management

The goals are to improve cosmesis, restore/maintain binocular single vision, and improve visual acuity.

#### 1. Optical Correction
*   **Myopia:** Full correction is essential. Uncorrected myopia reduces accommodative convergence, worsening the exotropia.
*   **Hypermetropia:** Correction is controversial; usually prescribed only if high, as it may relax accommodation and increase the exodeviation.

#### 2. Orthoptics and Conservative Therapy
*   **Indications:** Primarily for **Convergence Insufficiency** type or small deviations.
*   **Anti-suppression exercises:** To restore binocular awareness.
*   **Convergence exercises:** Pencil push-ups or Synoptophore exercises to improve fusional reserve.
*   **Occlusion Therapy:** Indicated if [[Amblyopia]] is present.

#### 3. Surgical Management
Surgery is the treatment of choice for most significant deviations (> 20-25 Prism Diopters).

*   **Goal:** In divergent strabismus, **slight overcorrection** is often indicated in the immediate postoperative period because eyes have a strong tendency to revert to their former divergent position.
*   **Common Procedures:**
    *   **Lateral Rectus Recession:** Weakening the lateral rectus (moving insertion posteriorly).
        *   Usually done bilaterally for Divergence Excess type.
    *   **Medial Rectus Resection:** Strengthening the medial rectus (shortening the muscle).
        *   **Recess-Resect (R&R) Procedure:** Unilateral Recession of LR + Resection of MR is common for Basic type or unilateral constant exotropia.
*   **Adjustments for Patterns:**
    *   **A-Pattern Exotropia:** Deviation increases in downgaze.
    *   **V-Pattern Exotropia:** Deviation increases in upgaze (V for Valley/diverge up).
    *   Surgery may involve vertical transposition of horizontal recti or weakening of overacting oblique muscles.

**Mnemonics for Surgical Planning:**
*   **MALE**: For A/V patterns without oblique overaction, transpose **M**edial recti to **A**pex and **L**ateral recti to **E**mpty space.
