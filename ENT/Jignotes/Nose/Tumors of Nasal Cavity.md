# [[Nose]] > Tumors of Nasal Cavity

### Tumors of the Nasal Cavity

Tumors of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses are rare, accounting for less than 1% of all malignancies. They pose a diagnostic challenge as early symptoms often mimic benign inflammatory conditions like rhinosinusitis.

---

### Classification

Tumors are broadly classified into **Benign** and **Malignant** lesions based on their biological behavior.

| Category | Tumor Types |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Benign** | • **Epithelial:** [[Squamous Papilloma]], [[Inverted Papilloma]] (Ringertz Tumor)<br>• **Mesenchymal:** [[Osteoma]], [[Fibrous Dysplasia]], [[Chondroma]], [[Hemangioma]]<br>• **Neural:** [[Schwannoma]], [[Neurofibroma]], [[Glioma]]<br>• **Congenital:** [[Dermoid]], [[Encephalocele]] |
| **Malignant** | • **Epithelial:** [[Squamous Cell Carcinoma]] (SCC), [[Adenocarcinoma]], [[Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma]]<br>• **Neural:** [[Olfactory Neuroblastoma]] (Esthesioneuroblastoma)<br>• **Others:** [[Malignant Melanoma]], [[Lymphoma]], [[Sarcomas]] (e.g., Rhabdomyosarcoma) |

### Benign Tumors

#### 1. Inverted Papilloma (Ringertz Tumor)
Also known as **Schneiderian Papilloma** or **Transitional Cell Papilloma**,.
*   **Definition:** The most common benign tumor of the nasal cavity. It is unique because the neoplastic epithelium grows **inward** into the underlying stroma (endophytic) rather than outward,.
*   **Etiology:** Associated with **Human Papillomavirus (HPV)** types 6, 11, 16, and 18,.
*   **Demographics:** Common in males (M:F = 3:1), age group 40–70 years,.
*   **Site:** Lateral wall of the nose (middle meatus area),.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Unilateral nasal obstruction.
    *   Blood-tinged nasal discharge or epistaxis.
    *   **Appearance:** Pale, polypoidal mass, often resembling a simple nasal polyp but firmer and vascular,.
*   **Clinical Implications:**
    *   **Locally Invasive:** Can erode bone and invade orbit or sinuses,.
    *   **Malignant Potential:** 5–15% risk of transformation into [[Squamous Cell Carcinoma]],.
    *   **Recurrence:** High recurrence rate if incompletely excised.
*   **Treatment:** Wide surgical excision.
    *   **Endoscopic Medial Maxillectomy** is currently favored,.
    *   External approaches: Lateral rhinotomy or Midfacial degloving,.

#### 2. Osteoma
The most common benign tumor of the [[Paranasal Sinuses]],.
*   **Site:** **Frontal sinus** (most common) > Ethmoid > Maxillary > Sphenoid,.
*   **Pathology:** Composed of mature bone (Ivory/compact or cancellous).
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Often asymptomatic (incidental finding on X-ray).
    *   If large: Headache, facial deformity, or mucocele formation due to obstruction of sinus ostia,.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Asymptomatic: Observe.
    *   Symptomatic: Surgical removal (Endoscopic or External approach),.

#### 3. Fibrous Dysplasia
A condition where normal bone is replaced by fibrous tissue and immature bone.
*   **Appearance:** "Ground glass" appearance on CT scan,.
*   **Site:** Maxilla is the most common site.
*   **Treatment:** Surgical resculpturing (paring down) for cosmetic deformity. Radiation is **contraindicated** due to risk of malignant transformation.

#### 4. Hemangioma (Bleeding Polypus)
*   **Capillary Hemangioma:** Also called **Bleeding Polypus of the Septum**.
    *   Arises from the anterior nasal septum ([[Little's Area]]).
    *   Presents as recurrent epistaxis and obstruction.
    *   **Treatment:** Local excision with a cuff of mucoperichondrium,.
*   **Cavernous Hemangioma:** Usually arises from turbinates.

#### 5. Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma (JNA)
*Although technically a nasopharyngeal tumor, it frequently invades the nasal cavity.*
*   **Demographics:** exclusively adolescent males,.
*   **Origin:** Sphenopalatine foramen.
*   **Key Signs:**
    *   **Frog Face Deformity:** Broadening of the nasal bridge.
    *   **Holman-Miller Sign (Antral Sign):** Anterior bowing of the posterior wall of the maxillary sinus seen on CT,.
*   **Clinical Implication:** **Biopsy is CONTRAINDICATED** due to profuse bleeding risk,.

### Malignant Tumors

Malignancies of the nose and PNS account for <1% of all malignancies but are aggressive.

**Risk Factors:**
*   **Wood dust:** [[Adenocarcinoma]] (Ethmoid sinus),.
*   **Nickel/Chrome/Leather:** [[Squamous Cell Carcinoma]],.
*   **Smoking:** Squamous Cell Carcinoma.

#### 1. Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)
*   **Incidence:** Most common malignant tumor (80%),.
*   **Sites:** Maxillary sinus > Nasal cavity > Ethmoid,.
*   **Specific Subtypes:**
    *   **Nose Picker's Cancer:** SCC arising from the anterior part of the nasal septum,.
    *   **Vestibular SCC:** Arises from the lateral wall of the vestibule; may metastasize to parotid nodes,.
*   **Treatment:** Surgery (Maxillectomy) + Radiotherapy.

#### 2. Adenocarcinoma
*   **Site:** Ethmoid sinuses and upper nasal cavity.
*   **Association:** High incidence in **hardwood furniture workers**.
*   **Prognosis:** Aggressive local progression.

#### 3. Olfactory Neuroblastoma (Esthesioneuroblastoma)
*   **Origin:** Olfactory epithelium in the upper 1/3 of the nasal cavity,.
*   **Age Distribution:** Bimodal (11-20 years and 50-60 years).
*   **Appearance:** Polypoidal, cherry-red, vascular mass,.
*   **Imaging:** **Dumbbell-shaped** tumor extending across the cribriform plate (intracranial and intranasal components).
*   **Biochemical Marker:** Can secrete catecholamines (check VMA levels),.
*   **Treatment:** Craniofacial resection + Radiotherapy,.

#### 4. Malignant Melanoma
*   **Site:** Anterior nasal septum or lateral wall.
*   **Appearance:** Bluish-black or slaty-grey polypoid mass. **Amelanotic** varieties exist,.
*   **Prognosis:** Poor; high rate of metastasis,.

### Clinical Features & Diagnosis

#### Symptoms
*   **Unilateral Nasal Obstruction:** Most consistent symptom.
*   **Epistaxis:** Blood-stained discharge is a "Red Flag".
*   **Pain:** Facial pain or paresthesia (involvement of [[Trigeminal Nerve]]).
*   **Orbital Symptoms:** Proptosis, diplopia, epiphora (nasolacrimal duct involvement).
*   **Deformity:** Cheek swelling, widening of nasal bridge.

#### Investigations
1.  **Nasal Endoscopy:** Visualize mass, site of origin, and biopsy,.
2.  **CT Scan (CECT):**
    *   Best for assessing **bony erosion** and destruction,.
    *   Staging of tumors.
3.  **MRI:**
    *   Best for **soft tissue** delineation.
    *   Distinguishes tumor from retained secretions.
    *   Assesses intracranial and orbital extension,,.
4.  **Biopsy:** Confirmatory. *Contraindicated in vascular lesions like Angiofibroma*,.

### Staging Systems (Maxillary Carcinoma)

Two key anatomical classifications are used to predict prognosis.

#### 1. Ohngren's Classification
An imaginary plane (Ohngren's Line) is drawn from the **medial canthus of the eye** to the **angle of the mandible**,,.

| Division | Location | Prognosis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Suprastructure** | Postero-superior to the line | **Bad Prognosis** (Closer to orbit/brain) |
| **Infrastructure** | Antero-inferior to the line | **Better Prognosis** |

#### 2. Lederman's Classification
Uses two horizontal lines (Sebileau’s lines) to divide the area into three,,:
1.  **Suprastructure:** Ethmoid, frontal, sphenoid sinuses (Above floor of orbit).
2.  **Mesostructure:** Maxillary sinus and respiratory nose (Between floor of orbit and floor of antrum).
3.  **Infrastructure:** Alveolar process (Below floor of antrum).

### Management Principles

**Benign Tumors:**
*   **Surgery:** Complete excision is the treatment of choice.
    *   **Endoscopic Resection:** For limited lesions (e.g., Inverted Papilloma, Angiofibroma),.
    *   **Lateral Rhinotomy / Midfacial Degloving:** For extensive lesions requiring wider access,.

**Malignant Tumors:**
*   **Combined Modality:** Surgery followed by Radiotherapy is the standard for most advanced stages (T3, T4),.
*   **Surgical Options:**
    *   **Total Maxillectomy:** For tumors of the maxillary sinus.
    *   **Craniofacial Resection:** For tumors involving the cribriform plate/anterior skull base (e.g., Esthesioneuroblastoma),.
*   **Radiotherapy:** Post-operative or palliative for inoperable cases.
*   **Neck Dissection:** Performed if cervical lymph nodes are palpable (N+).
