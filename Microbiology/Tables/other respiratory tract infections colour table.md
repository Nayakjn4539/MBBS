Vary in virulence and toxin production. Gravis is 100% toxigenic and most virulent. | **Diphtheria toxin (DT)** is the primary virulence factor. | Pathogenesis is toxin mediated (**toxemia but never a bacteremia**). Bacilli are noninvasive, present only at local site (pharynx). Toxin spreads via bloodstream. **Transmission**: Respiratory droplets or contact with infected skin lesions. **Source**: Carriers (95%) are more common than cases (5%). | **Diphtheria Toxin (DT)**: Polypeptide chain with Fragment A (active) and B (binding).

Pathogenesis depends on host immune status and underlying lung architecture. | **Aflatoxin** (from A. flavus) can cause liver carcinoma. | **Allergic forms**: Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), severe asthma. **Aspergilloma (Fungal ball)**: Colonization of a pre-existing lung cavity (e.g., post-TB). **Invasive aspergillosis**: Acute angioinvasive pulmonary infection in severely immunocompromised patients (profound neutropenia). | Sputum, tissue biopsies, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. | **Direct Examination (KOH mount or histopathology)** reveals narrow, septate hyphae with acute-angle branching. | **Culture on SDA** at 25°C. Species identification is based on colony morphology (e.g., smoky green for A. fumigatus, black for A. niger) and microscopic appearance (LPCB mount) of the conidial head (shape of vesicle, arrangement of phialides). | Identification is based on macroscopic and microscopic features of the culture. | **Antigen Detection**: **Galactomannan antigen** assay (ELISA) in serum or urine is useful for early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. **β-d-Glucan** assay is a non-specific marker of invasive fungal infection. **Antibody Detection**: Useful for chronic/allergic forms. | **Invasive aspergillosis**: Voriconazole is the drug of choice. **ABPA**: Itraconazole. **Aspergilloma**: Surgery. **Prophylaxis**: Posaconazole. | - |
| Penicilliosis | **Penicillium** species. (Most are environmental contaminants, P. marneffei is a true pathogen). | Hyaline, thin, septate hyphae. Vesicles are absent. Conidiophore and its branches give rise to metulae and phialides, which bear chains of conidia. This arrangement is called a **brush border appearance** (penicillus). | - | Some species produce mycotoxins. | Usually isolated as common laboratory contaminants. Can cause disease in specific settings, especially in immunocompromised hosts. | Mycotoxins released by certain species (e.g., P. cyclopium) can cause mycotoxicoses. | **Superficial disease**: Otomycosis, keratitis, onychomycosis. **Invasive penicilliosis**: Endophthalmitis, endocarditis (rare). **Allergic disease**: Asthma, allergic pneumonitis. **P. marneffei** (a dimorphic fungus) causes disseminated infection with wart-like skin lesions in HIV patients. | - | **LPCB mount** of colonies reveals the characteristic **brush border appearance** of the conidiophores. | **Culture on SDA** at 25°C: Colonies are rapidly growing, flat, with a velvety to powdery texture, and are typically greenish in color. | - | Diagnosis is by culture and microscopy. | - | - |
