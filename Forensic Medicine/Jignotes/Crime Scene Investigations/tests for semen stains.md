# [[Crime Scene Investigations]] > tests for semen stains

### Introduction
[[Semen]] is a biological fluid comprising a cellular component ([[spermatozoa]]) and a non-cellular component ([[seminal plasma]]). Seminal plasma is secreted by the prostate, seminal vesicles, Cowper's glands, and glands of Littre. 

The detection of semen is crucial in cases of [[sexual assault]], rape, sodomy, and bestiality. The tests are broadly classified into **Screening (Presumptive)** and **Confirmatory** tests.

### 1. Physical Examination (Screening)

This is the first step in identifying suspicious stains on clothing, bedding, or skin.

*   **Visual Inspection:**
    *   **Fresh stains:** Thick, glairy, whitish or yellowish, sticky texture with a characteristic "chlorine-like" or "fishy" odor.
    *   **Dried stains:** Stains appear irregular, **map-like**, with a distinct border darker than the center. The fabric becomes stiff and starchy to the touch.
    *   **Color:** Grayish-white or faint yellow (yellowing increases with age).

*   **Fluorescence Test (UV Light):**
    *   **Principle:** Seminal stains fluoresce due to the presence of **[[Choline]]** and flavins.
    *   **Method:** The article is exposed to filtered ultraviolet light (Wood's lamp).
    *   **Observation:** A **bluish-white fluorescence** is observed.
    *   **Limitation:** It is *not specific*. Other substances like urine, pus, leucorrheal discharge, milk, and certain detergents also fluoresce. It is only a screening tool to locate stains.

### 2. Chemical Examination (Presumptive)

These tests rely on detecting specific chemical components of the seminal fluid. They are sensitive but not absolute proof of semen.

#### A. Acid Phosphatase Test (Walker's Test)
*   **Principle:** The prostate gland secretes [[Acid Phosphatase]] (AP) in very high concentrations (500–1000 times higher than other body fluids).
*   **Method:** A swab or filter paper with the stain is treated with a substrate (sodium alpha-naphthyl phosphate) and a dye (Brentamine Fast Blue B).
*   **Result:** A **purple** color develops within 30 seconds to 1 minute.
*   **Significance:** Highly sensitive. A negative result almost certainly excludes semen. However, AP is also found in vaginal secretions and plants (cauliflower), though in much lower concentrations.

#### B. Crystal Tests
These are microchemical tests carried out on a glass slide.

| Feature | **Florence Test** | **Barberio's Test** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Target Substance** | [[Choline]] (from Seminal Vesicles) | [[Spermine]] (from Prostate) |
| **Reagent Used** | Florence Reagent (Iodine + Potassium Iodide) | Saturated Picric Acid |
| **Crystal Appearance** | **Dark brown, rhombic** crystals (Choline Periodide) | **Yellow, needle-shaped** crystals (Spermine Picrate) |
| **Shape Analogy** | Resembles **Hemin crystals** but larger | Resembles needles/crosses |
| **Specificity** | Not specific (Positive with other animal/plant tissues) | Relatively specific but false positives occur |

> **Mnemonic for Crystal Tests:**
> *   **Flo**rence is a **Ch**eF who cooks **Brown Rice** (Florence detects Choline $\rightarrow$ Brown Rhombic crystals).
> *   The **Barber** uses **Yellow Needles** to stitch (Barberio detects Spermine $\rightarrow$ Yellow Needle crystals).

### 3. Microscopic Examination (Confirmatory)

The demonstration of a single intact **[[spermatozoon]]** is the absolute and conclusive proof of the presence of semen.

*   **Technique:** The stain is macerated in acidulated water or saline, centrifuged, and the deposit is smeared on a slide.
*   **Staining Methods:**
    1.  **Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E):** Head stains purple/blue; tail stains pink.
    2.  **[[Christmas Tree Stain]] (Nuclear Fast Red + Picroindigocarmine):** This is the forensic standard.
        *   **Head:** Acrosome stains light pink; posterior head stains dark red/purple.
        *   **Tail/Neck:** Stains green or blue.
*   **Observation:**
    *   Human sperm head is ovoid/pyriform (approx 4-5 microns).
    *   Tail is long and delicate (approx 50 microns).
    *   *Note:* In old stains, tails may detach.

*   **Limitations:**
    *   **[[Azoospermia]]:** Semen without sperm (vasectomy, testicular disease). Microscopy will be negative, but chemical tests (AP, p30) will be positive.
    *   **Oligospermia:** Low sperm count makes detection difficult.

### 4. Serological and Immunological Tests

These tests detect specific antigens found in seminal plasma. They are confirmatory for semen even in the absence of sperm (Azoospermic semen).

*   **[[Prostate Specific Antigen]] (PSA) / p30 Test:**
    *   p30 is a glycoprotein secreted by the prostate.
    *   It is specific to semen.
    *   Tested using ELISA or crossover electrophoresis.
    *   **Result:** Positive reaction confirms semen. It is the method of choice in vasectomized individuals.

*   **Seminogelin:**
    *   A major protein in human semen responsible for coagulation.
    *   Highly specific marker for human semen.

*   **Precipitin Test:**
    *   Used to determine the **species origin** (whether the semen is human or animal).
    *   Uses anti-human serum.

*   **Blood Grouping:**
    *   If the individual is a **[[Secretor]]** (approx 80% of population), blood group antigens (ABO) can be detected in the seminal fluid.

### 5. Enzyme Markers

*   **Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH):** Specifically the **LDH-C4** isoenzyme is unique to spermatozoa and can be used as a specific marker.
*   **Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK):** High levels found in semen.

---

### 6. DNA Profiling

This is currently the gold standard for **linking the semen to a specific individual**.

*   **Extraction:** DNA can be extracted from the sperm head (nuclear DNA) even in old or washed stains.
*   **Method:** [[Short Tandem Repeats]] (STR) analysis.
*   **Y-STR Analysis:** Specific for male DNA; extremely useful in mixed samples (e.g., vaginal swabs where female DNA is abundant and male DNA is scarce).

### Medicolegal Aspects & Evidence Collection

1.  **Chain of Custody:** Must be strictly maintained.
2.  **Preservation:** Wet stains must be air-dried (not heated) before packing in **paper bags**. Plastic bags cause moisture retention and bacterial growth/putrefaction.
3.  **Persistence of Sperm:**
    *   **Vagina:** Motile sperm found up to 6–12 hours; non-motile up to 3–4 days (sometimes longer).
    *   **Cervix:** Up to 5–7 days.
    *   **Anal Canal:** 24 hours.
    *   **Oral Cavity:** 24 hours (rapidly destroyed by saliva).
    *   **Dried Clothing:** Can persist for months or years if kept dry.
4.  **Vasectomy:** A person who has undergone vasectomy will have no sperms (azoospermia) but will test positive for chemical markers like Acid Phosphatase, Choline, and p30/PSA.
