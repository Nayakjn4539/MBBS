# [[Nose]] > Septal Perforation

# Septal Perforation

### Definition
A [[Septal Perforation]] is a through-and-through defect in the nasal septum (involving both the mucosal flaps and the intervening cartilage or bone), allowing communication between the two nasal cavities.

---

### Etiology and Classification
The causes can be broadly classified into Traumatic, Pathological (Infective/Granulomatous), Drugs/Chemicals, and Idiopathic.

#### 1. Traumatic Causes (Most Common)
*   **Habitual:** Nose picking (digital trauma) is a frequent cause of ulceration and subsequent perforation.
*   **Iatrogenic (Surgical):**
    *   **[[Submucous Resection]] (SMR):** High risk of perforation, especially if mucosal tears occur on opposing sides of the septum at the same level.
    *   **[[Septoplasty]]:** Lower risk than SMR but still possible.
    *   **Cauterization:** Repeated cautery (chemical with silver nitrate or galvanocautery) for epistaxis, especially if done deeply or bilaterally at the same session.
    *   **Nasal Packing:** Pressure necrosis from tight packing.
*   **Injuries:** Sports injuries, assault, or road traffic accidents.
*   **Septal Hematoma:** If infected, leads to [[Septal Abscess]] $\rightarrow$ necrosis of cartilage $\rightarrow$ perforation.
*   **Foreign Bodies:** Neglected foreign bodies or [[Rhinolith]] causing pressure necrosis.
*   **Ornamentation:** Septal piercing.

#### 2. Pathological Causes (Infective & Granulomatous)
Specific diseases tend to target specific parts of the septum.

| Disease Entity | Site of Perforation | Mechanism/Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Tuberculosis]]** | **Cartilaginous Part** | Usually secondary to pulmonary TB; affects anterior septum. |
| **[[Lupus Vulgaris]]** | **Cartilaginous Part** | Cutaneous tuberculosis spreading to the nose. |
| **[[Leprosy]]** | **Cartilaginous Part** | Destruction of anterior nasal spine and cartilage. |
| **[[Syphilis]]** (Tertiary) | **Bony Part** | Gumma formation leads to destruction of the bony septum (Vomer/Ethmoid). |
| **[[Wegener's Granulomatosis]]** | **Total/Both** | Midline destructive lesion; can cause total septal destruction. |
| **[[Septal Abscess]]** | **Cartilaginous Part** | Acute infection (typhoid, measles, furuncle) leads to cartilage necrosis. |

**Mnemonic for Site of Perforation:**
*   **TB** and **L**eprosy affect the **C**artilage (**TLC**).
*   **S**yphilis affects the **B**one (**SB**).

#### 3. Drugs and Chemicals (Occupational/Habits)
*   **[[Cocaine]] Addiction:** Causes intense vasoconstriction and local ischemia leading to necrosis.
*   **Occupational Hazards:** Workers exposed to:
    *   Chromium plating (Chrome holes).
    *   Dichromate.
    *   Soda ash (Sodium carbonate).
    *   Arsenic.
    *   Nickel.
*   **Topical Steroids:** Prolonged use of steroid sprays.

#### 4. Idiopathic
In many cases, no history of trauma or disease is found.

### Clinical Features
Symptoms depend largely on the size and location of the perforation.

| Feature | Small Perforation | Large Perforation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sound** | **Whistling sound** (hissing) during inspiration or expiration. | Usually silent; no whistling. |
| **Crusting** | Minimal. | Significant crusting at margins due to drying effect of air currents. |
| **Bleeding** | Occasional. | Frequent **[[Epistaxis]]** when crusts detach. |
| **Sensation** | Often asymptomatic. | Sensation of obstruction (paradoxical) due to crusts; Dryness of nose/throat. |

**Clinical Implications:**
*   **[[Atrophic Rhinitis]]**-like changes (Rhinitis Sicca) may develop in large perforations due to turbulent airflow and drying.
*   **[[Saddle Nose Deformity]]** may coexist if the perforation was caused by a septal abscess or excessive removal of cartilage during surgery.

---

### Diagnosis and Assessment
1.  **History:** Inquire about surgery, trauma, nose picking, cocaine use, and occupation.
2.  **[[Anterior Rhinoscopy]] & Endoscopy:**
    *   Visualizes the perforation.
    *   Assess margins (granulations, crusting).
3.  **Biopsy:** Essential if granulomatous disease or malignancy (T-cell lymphoma, carcinoma) is suspected. Biopsy should be taken from the **edges** of the perforation.
4.  **Radiology:** X-ray or CT PNS to assess sinuses and extent of bone destruction (e.g., in Wegener's or Syphilis).
5.  **Serology:** VDRL/TPHA for Syphilis, c-ANCA for Wegener’s, ESR.

---

### Management
Treatment depends on symptoms. Asymptomatic perforations generally require **no treatment**.

#### 1. Conservative Management (Symptomatic Relief)
*   **Alkaline Nasal Douches:** To keep the nose free of crusts.
*   **Emollients:** Application of bland ointment (e.g., [[Vaseline]], liquid paraffin) or antibiotic ointment (Naseptin/chlorhexidine) to prevent drying and crusting.
*   **[[Septal Button]] (Silastic Obturator):**
    *   A prosthetic button (silicone/silastic) inserted to close the gap.
    *   Useful for patients unfit for surgery or those with large perforations.
    *   Relieves whistling and crusting.

#### 2. Surgical Management
Attempted only after the primary cause (e.g., active granulomatous disease) is treated and inactive.

*   **Small Perforations:**
    *   Surgical closure using **local plastic flaps** (mucosal flaps).
    *   Rotation or advancement flaps.
*   **Medium/Large Perforations:**
    *   Difficult to close; high failure rate.
    *   **Septodermoplasty:** Used in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia; anterior septal mucosa excised and replaced by split-skin graft.
    *   Pedicled grafts (e.g., from inferior turbinate or buccal mucosa).
    *   Midfacial degloving or external rhinoplasty approach may be needed for very large holes.

### Complications
1.  **Crusting and Obstruction:** Persistent crusts block the airway.
2.  **Recurrent [[Epistaxis]]:** From the vascular raw margins.
3.  **Nasal Whistle:** Socially embarrassing.
4.  **[[Saddle Nose]]:** Collapse of the dorsal support (common in syphilis and abscess).
