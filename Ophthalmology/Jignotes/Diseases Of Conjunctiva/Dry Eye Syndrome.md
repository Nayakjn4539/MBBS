# Dry Eye Syndrome (Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca)

### Definition
**Dry Eye Disease (DED)** is a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface characterized by a loss of homeostasis of the [[tear film]]. It is accompanied by ocular symptoms, in which tear film instability and hyperosmolarity, ocular surface inflammation and damage, and neurosensory abnormalities play etiological roles (TFOS DEWS II Definition).

---

### Etiological Classification
According to the DEWS II report, dry eye is broadly classified into two major categories, though overlap is common.

#### 1. Aqueous Deficiency Dry Eye (ADDE)
Primarily due to a failure of lacrimal tear secretion.
*   **[[Sjogren’s Syndrome]] Dry Eye:** An autoimmune chronic inflammatory disease.
    *   **Primary Sjogren's:** Occurs alone. Associated with **Sicca Complex** ([[Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca]] + [[Xerostomia]]/dry mouth).
    *   **Secondary Sjogren's:** Associated with other autoimmune connective tissue disorders (e.g., **[[Rheumatoid Arthritis]]**, [[Systemic Lupus Erythematosus]], Wegener's granulomatosis).
*   **Non-Sjogren’s Dry Eye:**
    *   **Lacrimal Deficiency:** Primary age-related hyposecretion (most common), Congenital [[Alacrima]], Infiltration (Sarcoidosis, Tumors).
    *   **Lacrimal Duct Obstruction:** [[Trachoma]], Chemical burns, [[Stevens-Johnson Syndrome]], [[Ocular Pemphigoid]].
    *   **Reflex Block:** Neuroparalytic keratitis (CN V damage), Facial nerve palsy (CN VII damage).

#### 2. Evaporative Dry Eye (EDE)
Caused by excessive evaporation from the ocular surface despite normal secretion.
*   **Intrinsic Causes:**
    *   **[[Meibomian Gland Dysfunction]] (MGD):** Most common cause. Leads to lipid layer deficiency.
    *   Disorders of lid aperture: [[Lagophthalmos]], Proptosis.
    *   Low blink rate: Computer Vision Syndrome, Parkinsonism.
*   **Extrinsic Causes:**
    *   **[[Vitamin A Deficiency]]:** Causes goblet cell loss (Mucin deficiency).
    *   Topical Preservatives (e.g., Benzalkonium chloride).
    *   Contact lens wear.
    *   Ocular surface disease (Allergic conjunctivitis).

### Clinical Features

#### Symptoms
*   **Sensations:** Grittiness, foreign body sensation ("sandy" feeling), burning, dryness, itching.
*   **Visual:** Blurring of vision (fluctuating), photophobia.
*   **Paradoxical Watering:** Reflex hyperlacrimation due to irritation.
*   **Diurnal Variation:** Symptoms of [[Meibomian Gland Dysfunction]] are often worse in the morning; Aqueous deficiency symptoms often worsen as the day progresses.

#### Signs
*   **Tear Film:**
    *   Reduced **Marginal Tear Strip** height (Normal > 1mm).
    *   Debris or mucus strands in the tear film.
    *   Frothy tears (indicative of meibomitis).
*   **Conjunctiva:**
    *   Lustreless appearance.
    *   Mild congestion (Hyperemia).
    *   Keratinization or wrinkling (Xerosis).
    *   **Lissamine Green** or **Rose Bengal** positive staining.
*   **Cornea:**
    *   Punctate Epithelial Erosions (PEE): Usually in the interpalpebral area.
    *   **[[Filamentary Keratitis]]:** Comma-shaped epithelial tags consisting of mucus and degenerated cells.
    *   Mucus plaques.
    *   Loss of corneal luster.

**Clinical Implication:** Severe untreated dry eye can lead to corneal ulceration, melting, and perforation.

### Diagnostic Evaluation

A combination of tests is usually required for diagnosis.

#### 1. Tear Film Break-Up Time (TBUT)
*   **Principle:** Measures the stability of the tear film (adequacy of the mucin layer).
*   **Procedure:** Instill fluorescein dye $\rightarrow$ Patient blinks $\rightarrow$ Examined under Cobalt Blue light. Time taken for the first dry spot (black spot) to appear after the last blink is noted.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   **Normal:** 15–35 seconds.
    *   **Abnormal:** < 10 seconds implies unstable tear film.

#### 2. Schirmer’s Tests
Measures total tear secretion using Whatman No. 41 filter paper strips (5 x 35 mm).

| Test Type | Methodology | Interpretation (Wetting after 5 mins) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Schirmer I** | Performed **without** anaesthesia. Measures **Total** secretion (Basal + Reflex). Strip placed at junction of lateral 1/3 and medial 2/3 of lower fornix. | **Normal:** > 15 mm <br> **Mild/Mod KCS:** 5–10 mm <br> **Severe KCS:** < 5 mm |
| **Schirmer II** | Performed **with** topical anaesthesia. Nasal mucosa irritated with cotton bud. Measures **Reflex** secretion. | Measures ability of lacrimal gland to secrete upon stimulation. |

#### 3. Vital Staining
*   **[[Rose Bengal]] Staining:** Stains devitalized/dead epithelial cells and mucus.
    *   *Pattern:* Interpalpebral staining (Triangles with base at limbus).
    *   *Disadvantage:* Causes significant stinging/pain.
*   **[[Lissamine Green]]:** Stains similar to Rose Bengal (dead cells) but is **non-toxic** and non-irritating. Preferred over Rose Bengal.
*   **[[Fluorescein]] Staining:** Stains areas of epithelial defects (corneal abrasions/erosions).

#### 4. Laboratory/Advanced Tests
*   **Tear Hyperosmolarity:** Most sensitive indicator. Normal < 308 mOsm/L. Values **> 312 mOsm/L** indicate KCS.
*   **Tear Lysozyme/Lactoferrin:** Levels decrease in dry eye (Lactoferrin < 0.9 is diagnostic).
*   **Impression Cytology:** Checks goblet cell density (decreased in dry eye) and squamous metaplasia.
*   **Phenol Red Thread Test:** Uses a pH-sensitive thread. Wetting length < 6mm in 15 seconds suggests dry eye.

### Treatment and Management

Treatment is graded based on severity (DEWS guidelines).

#### 1. Tear Substitution (First Line)
*   **Artificial Tears:**
    *   **Cellulose derivatives:** Methylcellulose (0.7%), Hypromellose (0.3%).
    *   **Polyvinyl Alcohol (1.4%).**
    *   **Sodium Hyaluronate:** Better retention and healing properties.
*   **Preservatives:** For frequent use (>4-6 times/day), **preservative-free** units are recommended to avoid epithelial toxicity (from Benzalkonium chloride).

#### 2. Conservation of Tears
*   **Punctal Occlusion:**
    *   *Temporary:* Collagen plugs.
    *   *Permanent:* Silicone plugs, electrocautery, or Argon laser punctoplasty.
*   **Reducing Evaporation:** Lateral [[tarsorrhaphy]] (in severe lagophthalmos), moist chamber spectacles.

#### 3. Anti-Inflammatory Therapy
Since inflammation is a key component of pathogenesis:
*   **Topical [[Cyclosporine A]] (0.05% or 0.1%):** Immunomodulator. Increases tear production and reduces inflammation. Long-term therapy.
*   **Topical Corticosteroids:** Low potency (e.g., Fluorometholone, Loteprednol). Used for short-term "pulse" therapy to control acute exacerbations. *Risk of steroid-induced glaucoma.*
*   **Topical Tacrolimus:** For refractory cases.

#### 4. Mucolytics
*   **Acetylcysteine (5% drops):** Useful for **[[Filamentary Keratitis]]** and tenacious mucus plaques.

#### 5. Treating Associated Conditions
*   **Meibomian Gland Dysfunction:** Warm compresses, lid hygiene, oral Tetracyclines/Doxycycline (for anti-inflammatory and lipid-regulating effect).
*   **Sjogren’s Syndrome:** Systemic management, secretagogues (Oral Pilocarpine/Cevimeline).

#### 6. Advanced/Severe Cases
*   **Autologous Serum Eye Drops:** Contains growth factors (EGF, TGF-beta) similar to natural tears.
*   **Contact Lenses:** Scleral contact lenses or Bandage Soft Contact Lenses (BSCL) to maintain a fluid reservoir.
*   **Amniotic Membrane Transplantation:** For non-healing epithelial defects.
