# Statistical Data: Various Methods of Presentation

Statistical data, once collected, must be arranged purposively to bring out important points clearly and strikingly. The presentation of data is the "heart" of statistical analysis. There are two main methods of presenting data: **Tabulation** and **Drawings** (Charts and Diagrams).

### 1. Tabulation
This is the first step before data is used for analysis. It involves the systematic arrangement of data in columns and rows.

*   **Principles of Tabulation**:
    *   Every table should have a distinct **Number** (e.g., Table 1).
    *   A **Title** must be given; it should be brief and self-explanatory.
    *   **Headings** of columns and rows must be clear and concise.
    *   **Footnotes** should be used to explain details if necessary.
    *   Data should be presented according to size, importance, or chronologically.

*   **Types of Tables**:
    1.  **Simple Table**: Presents measurement of a single set of items.
    2.  **Complex Table**: Presents multiple sets of items.
    3.  **[[Frequency Distribution Table]]**: Data is split into convenient groups (class intervals) and the number of items (frequency) occurring in each group is shown. This is essential for summarizing large datasets.
    4.  **Master Table**: A large table where all original data is entered; used as a source to draw specific subsidiary tables.

### 2. Charts and Diagrams
Visual presentation is often more impactful than tables. The choice of diagram depends on the nature of the data: **Quantitative** (Continuous) or **Qualitative** (Discrete).

#### A. Presentation of [[Quantitative Data]] (Continuous Variables)
These are used for variables like height, weight, blood pressure, or age, which have a continuous range.

1.  **Histogram**:
    *   **Description**: A graphical presentation of a [[Frequency distribution]]. It consists of a series of blocks.
    *   **Structure**: Class intervals are on the horizontal axis (X-axis) and frequencies on the vertical axis (Y-axis).
    *   **Key Feature**: It is an **Area Diagram**. The *area* of the rectangle is proportional to the frequency. There are **no gaps** between the blocks (unlike bar charts).
    *   > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> A series of adjacent vertical rectangles of varying heights based on frequency, with no spaces between them.

2.  **Frequency Polygon**:
    *   **Description**: A graph formed by joining the **mid-points** of the tops of the histogram blocks with straight lines.
    *   **Utility**: Useful when comparing two or more frequency distributions on the same graph.

3.  **Frequency Curve**:
    *   **Description**: When the number of observations is very large and class intervals are very small, the frequency polygon loses its angulation and becomes a smooth curve.
    *   **Example**: The **[[Normal Curve]]** (Gaussian distribution).

4.  **Line Chart (Line Diagram)**:
    *   **Description**: Shows the trend of events with the passage of **time**.
    *   **Utility**: Best for showing rise and fall of disease cases over months/years (e.g., Malaria trends from 2010–2020).

5.  **Cumulative Frequency Diagram (Ogive)**:
    *   **Description**: A graph of the cumulative relative frequency distribution.
    *   **Clinical Relevance**: Used to determine **[[Percentiles]]** and **[[Median]]** graphically. The curve usually has an 'S' shape.

6.  **Scatter Diagram (Dot Diagram)**:
    *   **Description**: Used to show the relationship (**[[Correlation]]**) between two quantitative variables (e.g., Height vs. Weight).
    *   **Interpretation**:
        *   *Positive correlation*: Dots go upward from left to right.
        *   *Negative correlation*: Dots go downward.
        *   *No correlation*: Dots are scattered randomly.

#### B. Presentation of [[Qualitative Data]] (Discrete Variables)
These are used for counts, attributes, or categories (e.g., sex, religion, blood group, death rates).

1.  **Bar Diagram**:
    *   **Description**: Length of the bar is proportional to the magnitude/frequency. Bars can be vertical or horizontal.
    *   **Key Feature**: Bars are separated by **spaces**.
    *   **Types**:
        *   *Simple Bar Chart*: For a single variable (e.g., IMR of different countries).
        *   *Multiple Bar Chart*: To compare two or more variables (e.g., Immunization status of males vs. females).
        *   *Component (Proportional) Bar Chart*: Bars are divided into parts to show the composition of a total (e.g., Causes of death making up the total mortality).

2.  **Pie Chart (Sector Diagram)**:
    *   **Description**: A circle divided into sectors. The area of each sector depends on the angle at the center.
    *   **Calculation**: $Angle = \frac{\text{Class Frequency}}{\text{Total Frequency}} \times 360^\circ$
    *   **Utility**: Best for showing percentage breakdowns (e.g., Budget allocation, Nutritional components).

3.  **Pictogram**:
    *   **Description**: Small pictures or symbols represent data (e.g., a picture of a man represents 1000 people).
    *   **Utility**: Popular for the layman/general public; less accurate for statistical analysis.

4.  **Map Diagram (Spot Map)**:
    *   **Description**: Shows the geographic distribution of frequencies.
    *   **Clinical Relevance**: Famous use by **[[John Snow]]** to identify the Broad Street Pump as the source of the **Cholera epidemic** in London (1854). It shows the clustering of cases.
