# [[Regional Injuries]] > Spinal Injuries and Railway Spine

### Spinal Injuries

Spinal injuries are mechanical injuries sustained by the vertebral column and the spinal cord. They are of significant medicolegal importance due to their high mortality rate in upper cervical lesions and severe morbidity (paralysis) in lower lesions. These injuries are common in traffic accidents, falls from height, and violent assaults.

#### Mechanism of Injury
Injuries to the spine and cord result from direct or indirect violence.
*   **Direct Force:** Penetrating wounds (stabbing, gunshot) or direct blows to the back.
*   **Indirect Force:**
    *   **Hyperflexion:** Violent forward bending (e.g., fall of a heavy weight on the head/shoulders). Common in lumbar and lower thoracic regions.
    *   **Hyperextension:** Violent backward bending (e.g., hitting the chin against a dashboard). Common in cervical regions.
    *   **Vertical Compression:** Fall from a height landing on feet or buttocks (e.g., causing burst fractures).
    *   **Rotational Shearing:** Twisting forces.

**Common Sites of Injury:**
1.  **C1-C2 (Atlanto-axial complex):** Often fatal due to brainstem compression.
2.  **C5-C6:** Most common site for flexion-rotation injuries.
3.  **T12-L1 (Thoracolumbar junction):** Common in falls and compression injuries.

#### Classification of Spinal Cord Injuries

**1. Concussion of the Spinal Cord**
*   **Definition:** Functional impairment of the cord due to jarring/shaking without gross anatomical destruction.
*   **Pathology:** Usually no naked-eye changes. Microscopically, may show oedema, axonal swelling, or petechial hemorrhages.
*   **Outcome:** Temporary loss of function (sensory/motor) with variable recovery.

**2. Contusion of the Spinal Cord**
*   **Haematomyelia:** Hemorrhage *into* the substance of the spinal cord (usually central grey matter). It may extend upwards and downwards.
*   **Haematorrhachis:** Hemorrhage *into* the spinal meninges (extradural, subdural, or subarachnoid spaces).
*   **Findings:** The cord appears swollen, soft, and mushy (pulping) at the site of impact.

**3. Laceration and Transection**
*   **Laceration:** Tearing of the cord tissue, often by bony fragments from a fracture or a penetrating weapon.
*   **Transection:** Complete severing of the cord.
    *   **Above C4:** Usually fatal due to respiratory paralysis (Phrenic nerve involvement).
    *   **Cervical enlargement:** [[Quadriplegia]].
    *   **Thoracic/Lumbar:** [[Paraplegia]].

#### Specific Spinal Fracture Patterns

| Fracture Type | Mechanism | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Wedge Fracture** | Hyperflexion | Anterior compression of the vertebral body. Stable. |
| **Burst Fracture** | Vertical Compression | Vertebral body shatters outward. Bone fragments may retropulse into the spinal canal. |
| **[[Hangman's Fracture]]** | Hyperextension + Distraction | Bilateral fracture of pedicles of **C2 (Axis)** with spondylolisthesis of C2 over C3. Seen in judicial hanging and traffic accidents (chin hitting dashboard). |
| **Jefferson Fracture** | Axial Compression | Burst fracture of the ring of **C1 (Atlas)**. |
| **Clay-shoveler's Fracture** | Hyperflexion/Shearing | Avulsion fracture of the spinous process of lower cervical vertebrae (C6, C7). |

#### Whiplash Injury
A specific type of cervical spine injury common in rear-end motor vehicle collisions.

*   **Mechanism:**
    1.  **Hyperextension (Phase 1):** The body is accelerated forward by the seat, but the head lags behind due to inertia, causing severe extension of the neck.
    2.  **Hyperflexion (Phase 2):** The head rebounds forward, causing flexion.
*   **Pathology:**
    *   Tearing of the **Anterior Longitudinal Ligament**.
    *   Avulsion of anterior parts of vertebral bodies.
    *   Disc herniation.
    *   Strain on neck muscles (Sternocleidomastoid).
*   **Symptoms:** Neck pain, stiffness, headache, paresthesia. Symptoms often appear *delayed* (24 hours after the accident).

### Railway Spine

**Definition:**
[[Railway Spine]] is a historical and medicolegal term referring to **concussion of the spinal cord** resulting from severe jolting or jarring of the body, typically seen in railway accidents or motor car collisions, *without* external evidence of injury to the spinal column.

**Pathogenesis:**
*   It is essentially a form of **spinal concussion**.
*   The violent shaking causes molecular disturbance or microscopic hemorrhages in the spinal cord.
*   Often associated with significant psychological overlay (Post-traumatic stress or conversion disorder).

**Clinical Features:**
*   **Onset:** Symptoms may not appear immediately; there is often a delay.
*   **Somatic:** Vague back pain, sensory disturbances (tingling, numbness), motor weakness, tremors, gait defects.
*   **Psychological:** Anxiety, irritability, loss of memory, post-traumatic psychosis.
*   **Recovery:** Generally poor, often complicated by litigation neurosis (compensation claims).

**Medicolegal Importance:**
*   Often cited in compensation claims following mass transport accidents.
*   Difficult to prove or disprove due to lack of gross anatomical findings.
*   Differentiation from **Malingering** is crucial.

> **Mnemonic for Spinal Injury Levels:**
> **C3, 4, 5** keep the diaphragm alive (Phrenic nerve origin).
> Injury above **C4** = Respiratory Arrest (Death).

### Autopsy Findings and Procedure

**External Examination:**
*   Look for abrasions/bruises over the back (may be minimal in Railway spine).
*   Palpate spinous processes for steps or gaps indicating fracture-dislocation.
*   "Pithing" wounds (needle puncture) at the nape of the neck (atlanto-occipital space).

**Internal Examination (Dissection Technique):**
1.  **Posterior Approach:** Body prone, block under the chest to flex the spine.
2.  **Incision:** Midline incision from occiput to sacrum.
3.  **Dissection:** Reflect muscles laterally to expose laminae.
4.  **Opening:** Use a bone saw/double-bladed saw to cut through the **laminae** (neural arches) on both sides.
5.  **Removal:** Lift the posterior bony strip to expose the dura and spinal cord.
6.  **Observation:**
    *   Check for **Haematorrhachis** (extradural/subdural hemorrhage).
    *   Open dura to check the cord.
    *   Serial transverse sectioning of the cord ("bread-loafing") to look for **Haematomyelia** (internal bruising/softening).
    *   Check vertebral bodies for fractures/dislocations.

**Important Artifact:**
*   **Undertaker's Fracture:** Subluxation of lower cervical spine (C6-C7) caused by the head falling backward forcibly *after death* (during handling). It involves tearing of the intervertebral disc but **no hemorrhage** (vital reaction is absent).

### Medicolegal Aspects

1.  **Cause of Death:**
    *   Immediate: Respiratory paralysis (high cervical), Neurogenic shock.
    *   Delayed: Hypostatic pneumonia, infected bed sores, ascending urinary tract infection (pyelonephritis) in paraplegics.
2.  **Manner:**
    *   **Accidental:** Most common (Traffic accidents, falls).
    *   **Suicidal:** Jumping from heights.
    *   **Homicidal:** Rare, but seen in "Pithing" (infanticide or cattle killing) or heavy blunt force to the neck.
3.  **Compensation:** Railway spine and Whiplash are frequent grounds for litigation and insurance claims; distinguishing genuine pathology from malingering is the expert's challenge.
