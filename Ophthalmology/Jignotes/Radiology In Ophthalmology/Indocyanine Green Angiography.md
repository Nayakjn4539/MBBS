# Indocyanine Green Angiography (ICG)

### Overview
[[Indocyanine Green Angiography]] (ICG) is a diagnostic imaging technique used to visualize the choroidal circulation of the eye,. Unlike [[Fundus Fluorescein Angiography]] (FFA), which primarily visualizes retinal circulation, ICG is optimized for examining the deeper vascular layers of the eye.

### Principle and Dye Properties
The efficacy of ICG lies in the specific physiochemical properties of the [[Indocyanine Green]] dye:
*   **Protein Binding:** ICG is **98% protein-bound** (binds to albumin and lipoproteins) in the blood,.
    *   **Physiological Effect:** Because of this high binding affinity, the dye stays within the blood vessels and does not leak easily through the fenestrations of the [[choriocapillaris]],. This allows for better retention within the vasculature.
*   **Spectral Characteristics:**
    *   **Absorption:** Peak spectral absorption occurs at **800–810 nm** (Near-Infrared spectrum).
    *   **Fluorescence:** It fluoresces in the infrared range.
    *   **Penetration:** The near-infrared light penetrates the [[Retinal Pigment Epithelium]] (RPE), macular pigment (xanthophyll), and even hemorrhage better than the blue light used in FFA,,.

### Procedure
*   **Route:** Intravenous injection.
*   **Dosage:** Typically **25 mg** dissolved in **2 mL** of aqueous solvent.
*   **Imaging:** A special fundus camera sensitive to infrared light is used to capture images as the dye circulates through the choroidal vessels.

### Indications
ICG is primarily indicated for disorders involving the choroidal vasculature and when FFA provides insufficient information due to blockage by blood or pigment.

**1. Macular Disorders (AMD):**
*   **Occult CNVM:** ICG is the **Investigation of Choice (IOC)** for Occult [[Choroidal Neovascular Membrane]] (CNVM). It visualizes the membrane located beneath the RPE which might be obscured on FFA.
*   **Recurrent CNV:** Evaluation of recurrent neovascularization.

**2. Vascular Disorders:**
*   **Idiopathic Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (IPCV):** ICG is essential for diagnosis, showing the characteristic polypoidal lesions.
*   **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR):** Used to visualize areas of choroidal hyperpermeability.
*   **Choroidal Hemangioma:** Helps in delineating the vascular channels within the tumor.

**3. Tumors:**
*   **Choroidal Melanoma:** Particularly pigmented melanomas.

**4. Surgical Utility:**
*   **Capsule Staining:** ICG (0.5% solution) is used intraoperatively to stain the anterior capsule of the [[Lens]] during [[Cataract Surgery]] (Capsulorrhexis), especially in mature cataracts with no fundal glow.

### Comparison: ICG vs. FFA

| Feature | Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA) | Indocyanine Green Angiography (ICG) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Target** | Retinal Circulation | Choroidal Circulation |
| **Dye** | Sodium Fluorescein (Orange-red) | Indocyanine Green |
| **Protein Binding** | Low (approx. 80% unbound/loosely bound) | **High (98%)**, |
| **Leakage** | Leaks rapidly from choriocapillaris (obscures choroidal detail) | Minimal leakage (stays intravascular) |
| **Light Source** | Blue Light (490 nm) | Near-Infrared Light (805 nm) |
| **Penetration** | Poor through RPE, pigment, and blood | **Excellent** through RPE, pigment, and blood |
| **Key Indication** | [[Diabetic Retinopathy]], Vascular Occlusions | [[Occult CNVM]], [[Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy]], |

### Contraindications
*   **Iodine Hypersensitivity:** ICG contains iodine; therefore, it is contraindicated in patients with a history of allergy to iodides or shellfish.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Occult CNVM Diagnosis:** In cases of [[Age-Related Macular Degeneration]] (ARMD), if FFA shows "late leakage of undetermined source," ICG is required to pinpoint the feeder vessels or the plaque of the neovascular membrane,.
*   **Treatment Planning:** Accurate localization of choroidal neovascularization using ICG aids in planning treatments like [[Photodynamic Therapy]] (PDT) or feeder vessel photocoagulation.
*   **Differentiating Lesions:** While [[Choroidal Nevus]] appears hypofluorescent on FFA (blocking background fluorescence), vascular tumors like [[Choroidal Hemangioma]] show characteristic wash-out patterns better studied with ICG.
