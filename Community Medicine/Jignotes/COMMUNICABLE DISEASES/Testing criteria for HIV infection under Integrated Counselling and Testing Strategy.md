# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Testing criteria for HIV infection under Integrated Counselling and Testing Strategy

### Testing Criteria for HIV Infection under [[Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre]] (ICTC) Strategy

Under the [[National AIDS Control Programme]] (NACP), HIV testing at ICTCs is not random; it follows specific protocols designed to maximize sensitivity and specificity while minimizing costs. The testing criteria are governed by the purpose of the test (Transfusion safety vs. Diagnosis) and the clinical status of the patient (Symptomatic vs. Asymptomatic).

The testing protocol utilizes the **E/R/S** principle: [[ELISA]] (E), **Rapid** (R), and **Simple** (S) tests,.

#### 1. The Three Strategies of HIV Testing
The [[NACO]] guidelines define three distinct strategies for testing,.

| Strategy | Number of Tests | Indication/Purpose | Interpretation |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Strategy I]]** | **1** | **Transfusion/Transplantation Safety:** Screening of blood, blood products, organs, tissues, and sperm donations. | • **Negative:** Considered safe for transfusion/use.<br>• **Positive:** The unit is discarded. <br>• **Note:** This result is *not* disclosed to the donor immediately for diagnosis; it is for safety only. |
| **[[Strategy II]]** | **2** | **Diagnosis in [[Symptomatic]] Persons:** Individuals presenting with AIDS-defining illnesses or symptoms (e.g., TB, recurrent infections). | • **Test 1 +ve & Test 2 +ve:** Report as HIV Positive.<br>• If Test 1 is negative, report negative.<br>• If results are discordant (1+ve, 2-ve), further testing/referral is needed. |
| **[[Strategy III]]** | **3** | **Diagnosis in [[Asymptomatic]] Persons:** Voluntary testing, antenatal screening, sentinel surveillance, or high-risk behavior without symptoms. | • **Test 1 +ve, Test 2 +ve & Test 3 +ve:** Report as HIV Positive.<br>• All three tests must be reactive using different antigen preparations.<br>• Used to rule out false positives in healthy-looking individuals. |

> **Clinical Relevance:** Never diagnose a patient as HIV positive based on a single test (Strategy I). A minimum of **Strategy II** (for sick patients) or **Strategy III** (for healthy patients) is mandatory for a definitive diagnosis,.

#### 2. Who is tested at an ICTC? (Target Population)
Testing under the ICTC strategy is categorized into two main approaches:

**A. Client-Initiated Counselling and Testing (CICT) - "Opt-In"**
*   **Definition:** Individuals present themselves to the ICTC of their own free will.
*   **Target:** Anyone who feels they are at risk or wants to know their status.
*   **Consent:** The client actively gives permission.

**B. Provider-Initiated Counselling and Testing (PICT) - "Opt-Out"**
*   **Definition:** A medical provider recommends the test as part of routine care. The patient must explicitly decline if they do not want it.
*   **Target Groups for PICT:**
    1.  **[[Tuberculosis]] Patients:** All TB patients are screened for HIV due to high co-infection rates (Bidirectional screening).
    2.  **[[STI/RTI]] Patients:** Individuals attending Suraksha Clinics.
    3.  **Pregnant Women:** All pregnant women enrolled in Antenatal Care (ANC) to prevent Parent-to-Child Transmission ([[PPTCT]]).
    4.  **Surgical Patients:** Before major procedures (universal precautions).
    5.  **High-Risk Groups (HRGs):** Female Sex Workers (FSW), Men who have Sex with Men (MSM), Injecting Drug Users (IDU), and Transgenders.

#### 3. Diagnosis in Special Groups

*   **Infants/Children (< 18 months):** Antibody tests (ELISA/Rapid) are **not** reliable due to the persistence of maternal antibodies.
    *   **Diagnostic Criteria:** [[DNA PCR]] (Dry Blood Spot) is used for Early Infant Diagnosis (EID) at 6 weeks of age.
*   **Window Period:** If a patient has a recent history of high-risk exposure (within the last 3 months) but tests negative, they are in the [[Window Period]]. They must be counselled to return for re-testing after 3 months.

#### 4. The "5 Cs" of Testing
Every HIV test under the ICTC strategy must adhere to the **5 Cs**:
1.  **C**onsent (Informed)
2.  **C**onfidentiality
3.  **C**ounselling (Pre and Post-test)
4.  **C**orrect Test Results (Quality Assurance)
5.  **C**onnection (Linkage to [[ART]] and care)

### 💡 Mnemonic for Strategies
**"One for Safety, Two for Sick, Three for Sure"**

*   **One (Strategy I):** Only for **Safety** (Blood banks).
*   **Two (Strategy II):** For **Sick** (Symptomatic) patients.
*   **Three (Strategy III):** To be **Sure** in healthy (Asymptomatic) people.
