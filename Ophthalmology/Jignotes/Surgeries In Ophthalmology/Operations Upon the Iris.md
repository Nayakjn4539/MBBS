# Operations Upon the Iris: Instrumentation and Procedures

## Ophthalmic Instruments for Iris Surgery

To perform operations upon the [[Iris]], specific instruments are required to maintain exposure, enter the [[Anterior Chamber]], manipulate the iris tissue, and cut or reposit it.

### 1. Eye Speculums
These are used to keep the [[Eyelids]] apart during surgery to provide adequate exposure of the eyeball.

**Types:**
1.  **Universal Metallic Eye Speculum:**
    *   Called "universal" because it can be used for both the right and left eye.
    *   It has two limbs and a spring mechanism with a screw to adjust the separation of the limbs. The blades are open.
2.  **Eye Speculum with Guard (Solid Blades):**
    *   Similar to the universal type but features solid blades.
    *   **Advantage:** It retracts the lids and the solid blades keep the [[Eyelashes]] away from the operation field.
3.  **Wire Speculum (Barraquer's):**
    *   Very light in weight.
    *   **Clinical Implication:** Causes minimal pressure on the eyeball, making it useful in open globe surgeries.

**Uses:**
*   [[Intraocular Surgery]]: Cataract, Glaucoma, Keratoplasty.
*   Extraocular surgery: Squint, Pterygium.
*   [[Enucleation]] and Evisceration.
*   Removal of conjunctival/corneal [[Foreign Body]].
*   Examination in cases of [[Blepharospasm]].

### 2. Keratome
A [[Keratome]] is a surgical knife used to create incisions to enter the anterior chamber.

*   **Structure:** It has a thin diamond-shaped blade with a sharp apex and two cutting edges.
*   **Types:** Straight or curved. Disposable curved keratomes are currently more common.
*   **Sizes:** Available in 2.8 mm, 3.0 mm, 3.5 mm, and 5.5 mm.

**Uses:**
*   To make **valvular corneal incisions** for entry into the [[Anterior Chamber]] (AC).
*   Used in modern [[Cataract Surgery]] techniques: [[Phacoemulsification]], [[Small Incision Cataract Surgery]] (SICS), and conventional ECCE.
*   Used for performing [[Iridectomy]] and [[Paracentesis]].

### 3. Iris Forceps
These are small, delicate forceps designed to grasp the iris tissue without causing excessive trauma.

*   **Structure:** Fine forceps with **1 x 2 teeth** on the inner side of the tip of the limbs. Available in straight or curved designs.

**Uses:**
*   To catch the [[Iris]] for performing **Iridectomy** during surgeries for [[Cataract]], [[Glaucoma]], or optical iridectomy.
*   To excise [[Iris Prolapse]].
*   To remove tumors or foreign bodies entangled in the iris.

### 4. De-Wecker’s Iris Scissors
These are specialized scissors designed for cutting tissues within the eye, perpendicular to the entry wound.

*   **Structure:** Fine scissors with small blades directed at **right angles** to the arms. The blades are kept apart (making a V-shape) by spring action.
*   **Mechanism:** Squeezing the handles closes the blades to cut; releasing them opens the blades via the spring.

**Uses:**
*   To perform [[Iridectomy]] (surgical removal of a piece of iris).
*   To perform [[Iridotomy]] (incision into the iris).
*   To cut prolapsed formed [[Vitreous]].
*   To cut [[Pupillary Membrane]].

### 5. Vannas’ Scissors
These are extremely fine and delicate scissors used for microsurgery.

*   **Structure:** Very small cutting blades kept apart by spring action. The blades may be straight or curved.

**Uses:**
*   **Iris Surgery:** Performing [[Iridectomy]] or [[Pupillary Sphincterotomy]].
*   **Cataract Surgery:** Cutting the anterior capsule (capsulotomy).
*   **Glaucoma Surgery:** Cutting the inner scleral flap in [[Trabeculectomy]].
*   **Other:** Cutting 10-0 nylon sutures and pupillary membranes.

### 6. Iris Repositor
A blunt instrument used to manipulate intraocular tissues safely.

*   **Structure:** Consists of a delicate, flat, malleable, straight or bent blade with blunt edges and a blunt tip attached to a handle.

**Uses:**
*   To **reposit the iris** back into the anterior chamber (e.g., after cataract delivery or in cases of iris prolapse).
*   To break **synechiae** (adhesions) at the pupillary margin.

## Surgical Procedures on the Iris

### Iridectomy
**Definition:** Iridectomy is the abscission (cutting out) of a part of the iris.

**Types of Iridectomy:**
1.  **Peripheral Iridectomy:** Removal of a small piece of iris at the periphery (root). Often used in [[Glaucoma]] surgery.
2.  **Key-hole Iridectomy:** Sectoral removal that includes the pupillary margin, looking like a keyhole.
3.  **Broad or Sector Iridectomy:** Removal of a large sector of the iris.

**Indications:**
*   As part of [[Glaucoma Surgery]] (e.g., Trabeculectomy) to prevent pupillary block.
*   Optical purposes (**Optical Iridectomy**) to improve vision in cases of central corneal opacity.
*   Abscission of **prolapsed iris** (e.g., after trauma).
*   Removal of foreign bodies, cysts, or tumors of the iris.

**Surgical Steps (Peripheral Iridectomy):**
1.  **Incision:** A small limbal or corneal incision is made.
2.  **Iris Prolapse:** The posterior lip of the wound is depressed to make the iris prolapse, or it is grasped with [[Iris Forceps]].
3.  **Excision:** The prolapsed knuckle of the iris is excised using **De-Wecker’s scissors**.
4.  **Reposition:** The iris is reposited back using an [[Iris Repositor]].
5.  **Closure:** The wound is sutured.

### Iridotomy
**Definition:** Incising a part of the iris without removing tissue.
**Methods:**
*   **Surgical Iridotomy.**
*   **Laser Iridotomy:** Preferred for [[Primary Narrow-Angle Glaucoma]].
