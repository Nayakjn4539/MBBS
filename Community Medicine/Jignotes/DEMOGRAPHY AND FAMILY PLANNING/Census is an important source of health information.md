# [[DEMOGRAPHY AND FAMILY PLANNING]] > Census is an important source of health information

### Definition
The **Census** is defined by the United Nations as "the total process of collecting, compiling and publishing demographic, economic and social data pertaining at a specified time or times, to all persons in a country or delimited territory". It is the primary and most important source of health information and [[Demography]] in most countries.

### Key Characteristics (Indian Context)
*   **Authority:** Conducted by the [[Registrar General and Census Commissioner]] of India, under the Ministry of Home Affairs.
*   **Legal Basis:** Conducted under the **Census Act, 1948**.
*   **Frequency:** It is a decennial exercise (conducted every **10 years**).
*   **History:** The first regular census in India was conducted in **1881**. The last one was in 2011 (15th Census).
*   **Census Moment:** The snapshot of the population is taken at **00:00 hours on 1st March** of the census year (e.g., 2011). This is known as the *Census Stop*.

### Methodology
There are two main methods of conducting a census:
1.  **De Facto (Date System):** A person is enumerated at the place where they are found on the census night. Used in India till 1931.
2.  **De Jure (Residence System):** A person is enumerated at their place of **permanent residence**, regardless of where they are on the census night. This method has been followed in India since **1941**.

**Phases of Census Operations:**
1.  **House Listing & Housing Census:** Collects data on housing conditions, amenities, and assets.
2.  **Population Enumeration:** Collects individual data (demographic, social, economic).

### Information Collected
The census provides a mine of information beyond just a head count:
*   **Demographic:** Age, sex, marital status.
*   **Social:** Literacy, education, language, religion, caste (SC/ST).
*   **Economic:** Occupation, employment status, income indicators.
*   **Fertility:** Age at marriage, number of children born alive.

### Uses of Census in Health
*   **Calculating Health Indices:** It provides the **Denominator** for calculating vital rates (e.g., [[Birth Rate]], [[Death Rate]], Morbidity rates). Without census data, these rates cannot be computed accurately.
*   **Health Planning:** Helps in planning National Health Programs and services based on the population distribution (e.g., how many PHCs or doctors are needed for a specific area).
*   **Population Dynamics:** Helps in determining the growth rate of the population and trends in [[Sex Ratio]].
*   **Socio-economic Research:** Provides baseline data for research into human ecology and social sciences.

### Census 2011: Key Findings
| Indicator | Statistic |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Population** | 1210.1 Million |
| **Sex Ratio** | 940 females per 1000 males |
| **Child Sex Ratio (0-6 yrs)**| 919 (Lowest since independence) |
| **Literacy Rate** | 74.04% (Males: 82.14%, Females: 65.46%) |
| **Density** | 382 persons/sq. km |
| **Decadal Growth Rate** | 17.64% |

**Note:** Census 2011 was the first to capture **Biometrics** (fingerprints and iris scans) for the [[National Population Register]] (NPR).

### Limitations
*   **Frequency:** Since it is done only every 10 years, inter-censal estimates are needed for the years in between.
*   **Operational Issues:** Massive undertaking requiring vast preparation; errors in coverage or content may occur due to enumerator bias or respondent recall bias.

### Mnemonic for Uses of Census: **"COUNTS"**
*   **C**alculation of Health Rates (Provides Denominator)
*   **O**ccupation and Economic status
*   **U**nderstanding Trends (Fertility/Mortality)
*   **N**ational Health Planning
*   **T**otal Population size
*   **S**ocial data (Literacy/Religion)
