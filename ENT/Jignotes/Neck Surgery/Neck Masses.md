# [[Neck Surgery]] > Neck Masses

### Classification of Neck Masses

A clinical approach to [[neck masses]] relies heavily on the age of the patient and the anatomical location of the swelling.

#### 1. Epidemiological Classification (Rule of 80)
Applicable to non-thyroid neck masses in adults (>40 years):
*   **80%** of neck masses are neoplastic.
*   **80%** of these neoplasms are malignant.
*   **80%** of these malignancies are metastatic lymph nodes.
*   **80%** of these metastases are from primaries above the clavicle (Head and Neck).

**Other Rules of Thumb (Rule of 7):**
*   **7 Days:** Inflammatory
*   **7 Months:** Malignant/Neoplastic
*   **7 Years:** Congenital

#### 2. Age-Based Differential Diagnosis

| Age Group | Most Common Cause | Second Most Common | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pediatric (<15 yrs)** | Inflammatory | Congenital | Reactive lymphadenitis, [[Thyroglossal duct cyst]], [[Branchial cyst]], [[Cystic hygroma]] |
| **Young Adult (16-40)** | Inflammatory | Congenital/ Neoplastic | Viral/Bacterial lymphadenitis, Lymphoma, Thyroid nodules |
| **Adult (>40 yrs)** | Neoplastic | Inflammatory | Metastatic [[Squamous cell carcinoma]], [[Lymphoma]], Thyroid malignancy |

#### 3. Anatomical Classification

| **Midline Swellings** | **Lateral Swellings (Anterior Triangle)** | **Lateral Swellings (Posterior Triangle)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [[Ludwig’s angina]] | [[Branchial cyst]] | [[Cystic hygroma]] |
| [[Thyroglossal duct cyst]] | [[Carotid body tumor]] | Lymphadenopathy (TB, Lymphoma, Mets) |
| [[Sublingual dermoid]] | Laryngocele | [[Cervical rib]] |
| Thyroid isthmus mass | Enlarged lymph nodes | Pharyngeal pouch |
| Thymic cyst | Thyroid lobe enlargement | |
| Subhyoid bursitis | Submandibular salivary gland swelling | |

### Anatomy of the Neck

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck and the cervical lymph node levels I-VII

#### Cervical Lymph Node Levels
Crucial for describing [[Neck Dissection]] and tumor metastasis.

*   **Level I:** Submental (IA) and Submandibular (IB).
*   **Level II:** Upper Jugular (Skull base to hyoid/carotid bifurcation).
    *   **IIA:** Anterior to Spinal Accessory Nerve (SAN).
    *   **IIB:** Posterior to SAN.
*   **Level III:** Middle Jugular (Hyoid to cricoid/omohyoid).
*   **Level IV:** Lower Jugular (Cricoid to clavicle).
*   **Level V:** Posterior Triangle (Posterior to sternocleidomastoid).
    *   **VA:** Above cricoid/spinal accessory level.
    *   **VB:** Below cricoid/spinal accessory level.
*   **Level VI:** Anterior Compartment (Pretracheal, Paratracheal, Prelaryngeal/Delphian).
*   **Level VII:** Superior Mediastinal nodes.

**Ho's Triangle:** Supraclavicular fossa (part of Level V); nodes here are often N3 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma staging.

### Clinical Evaluation

#### History
*   **Duration:** Acute (infection), progressive (neoplasm).
*   **Pain:** Painful (Inflammatory/Abscess), Painless (Neoplastic/Tuberculous/Cystic).
*   **Associated Symptoms:** Dysphagia, hoarseness, otalgia (referred pain), epistaxis, nasal obstruction (suggests upper aerodigestive tract primary).
*   **Risk Factors:** Smoking, alcohol, chewing tobacco (Head & neck cancer risk).

#### Physical Examination
*   **Location:** Determine which triangle the mass occupies.
*   **Consistency:**
    *   **Hard:** Carcinoma metastasis.
    *   **Rubbery:** [[Lymphoma]].
    *   **Soft/Cystic:** Cysts, Lipoma, Abscess.
    *   **Matted:** [[Tuberculosis]].
*   **Fixity:** Fixation to skin or underlying muscle/bone suggests malignancy or advanced inflammation.
*   **Specific Signs:**
    *   **Movement with swallowing:** Thyroid masses, Thyroglossal cysts, Subhyoid bursitis.
    *   **Movement with tongue protrusion:** [[Thyroglossal duct cyst]] (due to attachment to foramen caecum).
    *   **Pulsation:** Carotid body tumor (transmitted), Aneurysm (expansile).
    *   **Transillumination:** [[Cystic hygroma]].
    *   **Compressibility:** Hemangioma, Lymphangioma.

### Specific Congenital/Developmental Masses

#### 1. Thyroglossal Duct Cyst
*   **Defect:** Failure of the thyroglossal duct to obliterate after the descent of the thyroid gland from the foramen caecum to the neck.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Midline neck swelling (usually subhyoid).
    *   Moves up with deglutition and **protrusion of the tongue** (Pathognomonic).
    *   Common in children but can present in young adults.
*   **Complications:** Infection, Fistula formation, Malignancy (Papillary carcinoma rare).
*   **Treatment:** **Sistrunk Operation** (Excision of cyst, tract, and the central body of the hyoid bone up to the foramen caecum) to prevent recurrence.

#### 2. Branchial Cyst
*   **Defect:** Remnants of the [[branchial apparatus]] (usually 2nd branchial cleft).
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Smooth, oval, fluctuating swelling.
    *   Location: Anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle (junction of upper 1/3 and lower 2/3).
    *   Usually presents in young adults (2nd-3rd decade).
*   **Diagnosis:** Aspiration yields straw-colored fluid with **cholesterol crystals**.
*   **Treatment:** Surgical excision.

#### 3. Cystic Hygroma (Lymphangioma)
*   **Defect:** Congenital malformation of the lymphatic system (sequestration of jugular lymph sac).
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Soft, doughy, lobulated, cystic swelling.
    *   Location: Posterior triangle (most common).
    *   **Brilliantly transilluminant.**
    *   Present at birth or early infancy.
*   **Treatment:** Surgical excision (mainstay), Sclerotherapy (for extensive lesions).

#### 4. Dermoid Cyst
*   **Defect:** Entrapment of epithelium along lines of embryonic fusion.
*   **Clinical Features:** Midline swelling (submental or suprasternal), non-tender, free from skin but may be attached to deeper structures. Do not move with tongue protrusion.
*   **Treatment:** Surgical excision.

### Neoplastic Neck Masses

#### 1. Metastatic Lymph Nodes
*   **Adults >40 years:** Consider malignant until proven otherwise.
*   **Characteristics:** Hard, painless, fixity.
*   **Solitary Nodule:** Often squamous cell carcinoma from the aerodigestive tract.
*   **Management:** Search for primary (panendoscopy, imaging). If unknown primary: [[Neck dissection]] +/- Radiotherapy.

#### 2. Lymphoma (Hodgkin's & Non-Hodgkin's)
*   **Clinical Features:** Rubbery, discrete or matted nodes, hepatosplenomegaly, "B" symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss).
*   **Diagnosis:** Excision biopsy (to preserve architecture for histology). **FNAC is often insufficient for typing.**

#### 3. Carotid Body Tumor (Chemodectoma)
*   **Pathology:** Paraganglioma arising from chemoreceptor cells at the carotid bifurcation.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Painless, slow-growing mass.
    *   **Pulsatile** (transmitted pulsation).
    *   **Mobile side-to-side but NOT vertically** (fixed to carotid artery).
    *   **Lyre's Sign** on Angiography/MRI (Splaying of Internal and External Carotid Arteries).
*   **Treatment:** Surgical excision (vascular, may require pre-op embolization), Radiotherapy for elderly/unfit.

#### 4. Thyroid Neoplasms
*(Solitary Thyroid Nodule)*
*   **Risk of Malignancy:** High in males, age <20 or >60, rapid growth, hard consistency, vocal cord paralysis.
*   **Investigation:** **FNAC** is the gold standard.
*   **Scan:** Cold nodules (non-functioning) are more likely to be malignant than hot nodules.

### Diagnostic Investigations

1.  **Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology ([[FNAC]]):**
    *   **First-line investigation** for neck masses.
    *   Distinguishes benign vs. malignant, cystic vs. solid.
    *   **Contraindication:** Vascular masses (e.g., Carotid body tumor) - relative; Pulsatile masses.

2.  **Ultrasonography ([[USG]]):**
    *   Differentiates solid vs. cystic.
    *   Non-invasive, no radiation. Good for thyroid and lymph node characterization.

3.  **Computed Tomography ([[CT]]):**
    *   Contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is standard for staging malignancy, assessing extent, bone erosion, and retropharyngeal/deep nodes.
    *   **Rim enhancement:** Suggests abscess or necrotic node.

4.  **Magnetic Resonance Imaging ([[MRI]]):**
    *   Better soft-tissue resolution. Preferred for nasopharynx, parapharyngeal space, and skull base lesions.

5.  **PET Scan:**
    *   Useful for identifying unknown primary tumors and distant metastases.

### Management: Neck Dissection

Surgery to remove lymph nodes and fibrofatty tissue for cancer management.

#### 1. Radical Neck Dissection ([[RND]])
*   **Removal of:** Lymph node levels I-V.
*   **Sacrifice of:**
    1.  Sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM).
    2.  Internal Jugular Vein (IJV).
    3.  Spinal Accessory Nerve (SAN).

#### 2. Modified Radical Neck Dissection ([[MRND]])
*   **Removal of:** Levels I-V.
*   **Preservation of:** One or more non-lymphatic structures (SAN, IJV, SCM).
    *   **Type I:** Preserves SAN.
    *   **Type II:** Preserves SAN + IJV.
    *   **Type III (Functional):** Preserves SAN + IJV + SCM.

#### 3. Selective Neck Dissection ([[SND]])
*   Removal of only selected nodal groups at highest risk of metastasis based on the primary tumor site.
    *   **Supraomohyoid:** Levels I-III (Oral cavity cancer).
    *   **Lateral:** Levels II-IV (Larynx/Oropharynx cancer).
    *   **Posterolateral:** Levels II-V (Scalp melanoma).
    *   **Central Compartment:** Level VI (Thyroid cancer).

#### 4. Extended Neck Dissection
*   Includes removal of additional lymph node groups (e.g., Level VI, VII, retropharyngeal) or non-lymphatic structures (e.g., carotid artery, hypoglossal nerve) beyond RND limits.
