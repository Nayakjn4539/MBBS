# Vaccine Associated Paralytic Polio (VAPP)

### Definition
**Vaccine Associated Paralytic Polio (VAPP)** is a rare adverse event following immunization with **Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV)** where the recipient or a contact develops paralytic poliomyelitis clinically indistinguishable from that caused by the wild poliovirus (WPV). It occurs because the live attenuated vaccine virus reverts to neurovirulence during multiplication in the intestine.

### Etiology and Mechanism
*   **Cause:** The live attenuated Sabin strains in OPV undergo genetic changes/mutations during replication in the human intestine.
*   **Neurovirulence:** These mutations allow the virus to regain neurovirulence (ability to attack the nervous system).
*   **Culprit Strain:** It is most frequently associated with **[[Sabin Type 3]]** (60% of cases), followed by Sabin Type 2, and least commonly Sabin Type 1.

> **Mnemonic:** **"Type 3 is the Threat"** — Sabin Type 3 is the most common cause of VAPP.

### Types of VAPP
VAPP can manifest in two scenarios:
1.  **Recipient VAPP:** Occurs in the child who received the vaccine.
2.  **Contact VAPP:** Occurs in a non-immune or unimmunized person who is in close contact with a recent vaccine recipient (who is excreting the mutated virus in feces).

### Epidemiology and Risk Factors
*   **Incidence:** It is extremely rare.
    *   Approximately **1 case per 1 million** vaccinees.
    *   Some estimates suggest 1 in 2.7 million doses.
*   **Timing of Risk:** The risk is significantly higher following the **[[First Dose]]** of OPV (1 in 750,000) compared to subsequent doses (1 in 5.1 million).
*   **Vulnerable Groups:**
    *   Immunocompromised individuals (e.g., B-cell deficiency, HIV).
    *   Adults are at higher risk than children for contact VAPP.

### Case Definition (WHO Criteria)
For a case to be classified as VAPP, it must meet specific criteria:

| Criteria | Recipient VAPP | Contact VAPP |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Onset of Paralysis** | **4 to 30 days** after receiving OPV | **4 to 75 days** after contact with recipient |
| **Virology** | Isolation of vaccine virus from stool | Isolation of vaccine virus |
| **Wild Virus** | **Absence** of Wild Polio Virus | **Absence** of Wild Polio Virus |
| **Sequelae** | Neurological deficits remaining **60 days** after onset (or death) | Residual paralysis after 60 days (or death) |

### Clinical Features
*   **Presentation:** Identical to wild poliomyelitis.
*   **Symptoms:** Acute onset of **[[Asymmetrical Flaccid Paralysis]]**.
*   **Fever:** Often present at the onset of paralysis.
*   **Progression:** Rapid progression of paralysis (usually completes within 4-7 days).
*   **Sensation:** No sensory loss.

### Differential Diagnosis: VAPP vs. VDPV
Students often confuse VAPP with Vaccine Derived Polio Virus (VDPV).

| Feature | VAPP (Vaccine Associated Paralytic Polio) | VDPV (Vaccine Derived Polio Virus) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nature** | Sporadic event | Can cause **Outbreaks** |
| **Spread** | No person-to-person spread (End of chain) | Sustained circulation in community (cVDPV) |
| **Genetics** | Minor genetic reversion | Significant genetic divergence (>1% for Types 1 & 3) |
| **Risk Factor** | First dose of OPV | Low herd immunity/Low coverage |

### Prevention and The "Endgame" Strategy
The risk of VAPP (specifically Type 2) outweighed the benefit once Wild Polio Type 2 was eradicated. This led to major strategic shifts:
1.  **The Switch:** Global switch from Trivalent OPV (tOPV) to **[[Bivalent OPV]] (bOPV)** in April 2016 to remove the Type 2 component.
2.  **IPV Introduction:** Introduction of **[[Inactivated Polio Vaccine]] (IPV)**. IPV is a killed vaccine and **carries ZERO risk of VAPP**.
3.  **Sequential Schedule:** Using IPV followed by OPV reduces the risk of VAPP while maintaining mucosal immunity.

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Surveillance:** VAPP is monitored through **[[AFP Surveillance]]**. Stool samples must be transported in a **Reverse Cold Chain** (+2 to +8°C) to differentiate vaccine virus from wild virus.
*   **Contraindication:** OPV is contraindicated in immunocompromised children (and their siblings) to prevent VAPP. IPV should be used instead.
