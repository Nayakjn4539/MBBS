### Bipolar Disorder (Manic-Depressive Psychosis)

**Bipolar Disorder** is a major [[Affective Disorder]] (Mood Disorder) characterized by recurrent episodes of **Mania** (elation/excitement) and **Depression** (sadness), separated by periods of normal mood known as **[[Lucid Interval]]**.

The forensic importance lies in the fact that during acute episodes, the individual’s judgment, insight, and impulse control are severely impaired, affecting their civil and criminal responsibilities.

### Classification

1.  **Bipolar I Disorder:** Characterized by at least one full-blown **Manic** episode. Depressive episodes may also occur.
2.  **Bipolar II Disorder:** Characterized by at least one **Hypomanic** episode (less severe than mania) and at least one Major Depressive episode.
3.  **Cyclothymia:** Chronic instability of mood with mild hypomania and mild depression for at least 2 years.

### Medicolegal Aspects

#### A. Civil Responsibility
1.  **Management of Property:**
    *   **Mania:** The person may squander money on reckless schemes or expensive gifts due to grandiose delusions.
    *   **Depression:** May allow business to ruin due to apathy or delusion of poverty.
    *   *Action:* The court may appoint a manager for their property under the Mental Health Act.
2.  **Contracts:**
    *   Contracts made during a manic or depressive episode are **voidable** if the disorder prevented the person from understanding the nature of the contract.
    *   Contracts made during a **[[Lucid Interval]]** are valid.
3.  **Marriage:**
    *   If the person was suffering from the disorder at the time of marriage and could not understand the implications, the marriage can be declared null and void.
    *   It is a valid ground for divorce.
4.  **[[Testamentary Capacity]] (Will):**
    *   **Mania:** A will may be invalid if the person leaves property to strangers due to grandiose benevolence or momentary whims.
    *   **Depression:** A will may be invalid if the person disinherits family due to delusions of guilt or unworthiness.
    *   A will made during a **lucid interval** is valid.

#### B. Criminal Responsibility
Patients may be absolved of criminal responsibility under **[[McNaughten's Rule]]** (Section 84 IPC) if it is proved that at the time of the act, they were incapable of knowing the nature of the act or that it was wrong/contrary to law.

1.  **Crimes in Mania:**
    *   Usually minor offenses: Petty theft (Kleptomania), public drunkenness, indecent exposure, sexual assault, or creating a public nuisance.
    *   Homicide is rare but may occur in a sudden fit of passion or if physically restrained.
    *   The act is usually unpremeditated, done openly without concealment, and often senseless.

2.  **Crimes in Depression:**
    *   **Suicide:** The most common medicolegal complication.
    *   **Extended Suicide (Homicide-Suicide):** A depressed parent (usually mother) may kill her children to "save" them from a world of suffering and then kill herself. This is done out of delusional love/protection, not malice.
    *   **Confessions:** A depressed patient may confess to crimes they never committed due to extreme guilt.

### Autopsy Findings
There are no specific anatomical findings for Bipolar Disorder itself. The autopsy findings are usually related to the **Manner of Death**:
1.  **Suicide:** Signs of hanging, poisoning (toxicology screen is vital), cut throat, or fall from height.
2.  **Accident:** Trauma signs from reckless behavior during the manic phase (e.g., road traffic accidents).
3.  **Natural:** Evidence of cardiovascular disease (often comorbid due to lifestyle factors).
