# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > What are the cardinal signs of leprosy? How will you classify & treat a case of leprosy according to NLEP guidelines? What are the important complications of leprosy?

### Cardinal Signs of Leprosy

Diagnosis of [[Leprosy]] (Hansen's Disease) is primarily clinical. For a confirmed diagnosis, **at least one** of the following **three cardinal signs** must be present:

1.  **Hypopigmented or Reddish Skin Lesions:** These patches must show a **definite loss of sensation** (anesthesia or hypoesthesia). The earliest sensation lost is usually temperature, followed by light touch and pain.
2.  **Thickened Peripheral Nerves:** Enlargement or thickening of peripheral nerve trunks (like the ulnar or lateral popliteal nerves) accompanied by **loss of sensation** and/or **muscle weakness/paralysis** in the area supplied by that nerve.
3.  **Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB):** Demonstration of *Mycobacterium leprae* in [[Slit Skin Smears]] or skin biopsy.

> **Clinical Relevance:** A skin patch without sensory loss is *not* leprosy. Itches or painful patches are generally not leprosy.

**Mnemonic: The 3 S's of Diagnosis**
*   **S**kin patch (Hypopigmented/Reddish)
*   **S**ensation loss (Anesthesia)
*   **S**mear positive (AFB)

### Classification of Leprosy (NLEP Guidelines)

Under the [[National Leprosy Eradication Programme]] (NLEP), leprosy is classified operationally for the purpose of treatment into two categories based on the number of skin lesions, nerve involvement, and bacterial index.

| Feature | **Paucibacillary (PB)** | **Multibacillary (MB)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Skin Lesions** | **1 to 5** lesions | **6 or more** lesions |
| **Nerve Involvement** | No nerve or **Only 1** nerve trunk involved | **More than 1** nerve trunk involved |
| **Skin Smear** | **Negative** at all sites | **Positive** at any site |

*Note:* If a patient has 1-5 lesions but the skin smear is positive, they are classified and treated as **Multibacillary (MB)**.

### Treatment According to NLEP Guidelines

Treatment is via **Multi-Drug Therapy (MDT)**. The drugs are provided in convenient **Blister Calendar Packs** (different colors for children and adults) to ensure compliance.

#### 1. Paucibacillary (PB) Leprosy Treatment
*   **Duration:** 6 months (must be completed within 9 months).
*   **Color of Pack:** Green.

| Drug | Adult Dosage (>15 yrs) | Child Dosage (10–14 yrs) | Frequency |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rifampicin** | 600 mg | 450 mg | **Once Monthly** (Supervised) |
| **Dapsone** | 100 mg | 50 mg | **Daily** (Self-administered) |

#### 2. Multibacillary (MB) Leprosy Treatment
*   **Duration:** 12 months (must be completed within 18 months).
*   **Color of Pack:** Red.

| Drug | Adult Dosage (>15 yrs) | Child Dosage (10–14 yrs) | Frequency |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rifampicin** | 600 mg | 450 mg | **Once Monthly** (Supervised) |
| **Clofazimine** | 300 mg | 150 mg | **Once Monthly** (Supervised) |
| **Clofazimine** | 50 mg | 50 mg (alternate days) | **Daily** (Self-administered) |
| **Dapsone** | 100 mg | 50 mg | **Daily** (Self-administered) |

**Important Clinical Notes:**
*   **Rifampicin** is the most potent bactericidal drug; a single dose kills 99.9% of viable bacilli. It must always be taken under supervision.
*   **Clofazimine** causes brownish/black discoloration of the skin, which is reversible but requires patient counseling.
*   **Pregnancy:** MDT is considered safe and should be continued during pregnancy.

### Important Complications of Leprosy

Complications arise due to nerve damage, immunological reactions, or infiltration of organs.

#### 1. Deformities and Disabilities
These are the hallmarks of neglected leprosy, primarily caused by nerve damage.
*   **Face:** [[Facies Leonina]] (lion face due to infiltration), sagging face (facial nerve palsy), loss of eyebrows (madarosis), depressed/saddle nose.
*   **Hands:**
    *   **Ulnar Nerve:** **Claw Hand** (partial or total).
    *   **Median Nerve:** Ape thumb/hand (inability to oppose thumb).
    *   **Radial Nerve:** **Wrist Drop**.
    *   **Absorption:** Shortening of digits due to repeated trauma and infection in anesthetic hands.
*   **Feet:**
    *   **Lateral Popliteal Nerve:** **Foot Drop**.
    *   **Posterior Tibial Nerve:** Claw toes, plantar ulcers (trophic ulcers).

**Mnemonic for Nerve Damage:**
**U**ncle **M**ike **R**uns **L**ong **P**aths
*   **U**lnar nerve $\rightarrow$ Claw hand
*   **M**edian nerve $\rightarrow$ Ape hand
*   **R**adial nerve $\rightarrow$ Wrist drop
*   **L**ateral Popliteal $\rightarrow$ Foot drop
*   **P**osterior Tibial $\rightarrow$ Claw toes/Plantar anesthesia

#### 2. Ocular Complications
*   **Lagophthalmos:** Inability to close the eyelid (Facial nerve damage) leads to exposure keratitis.
*   Corneal ulcers and opacities.
*   Iritis/Iridocyclitis (often part of Type 2 reaction).
*   Blindness.

#### 3. Lepra Reactions
These are acute inflammatory episodes occurring during the chronic course of the disease.

| Feature | **Type 1 Reaction (Reversal)** | **Type 2 Reaction (ENL)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type of Leprosy** | Borderline types (BT, BB, BL) | Multibacillary (LL, BL) |
| **Mechanism** | Delayed Hypersensitivity (CMI) | Immune Complex (Humoral) |
| **Skin Signs** | Existing lesions become **red, swollen, painful** | **New** tender red nodules (Evanescent) appear |
| **Systemic Symptoms**| Generally absent | Fever, joint pain, malaise, orchitis, iritis |
| **Treatment** | Steroids (Prednisolone) + Analgesics | Steroids (severe) or Thalidomide/Clofazimine |

**Important:** **Never stop MDT** during a lepra reaction.
