# Voluntary Health Agencies in India

A **Voluntary Health Agency** is defined as an organization that is administered by an autonomous board which holds meetings, collects funds for its support chiefly from private sources and expends money, whether with or without paid workers, in conducting a program directed primarily to furthering public health by providing health services, health education, or by advancing research or legislation for health.

### Functions of Voluntary Health Agencies
