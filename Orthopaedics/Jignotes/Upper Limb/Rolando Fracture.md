# Rolando Fracture

### Definition
**Rolando Fracture** is a comminuted, [[intra-articular fracture]] of the base of the [[first metacarpal]] bone (thumb). It is essentially a T-shaped or Y-shaped fracture involving the [[trapezio-metacarpal joint]].

*   It is considered a variant of [[Bennett’s fracture]] but is distinguished by the presence of comminution (multiple fragments).
*   It typically presents as a three-part fracture or a highly comminuted fracture.

### Mechanism of Injury
The injury is caused by **axial loading** applied to the [[thumb]] while it is in a position of **abduction**.
*   Common causes include:
    *   Impaction against a steering wheel or handle bar.
    *   Sporting events.
    *   Falls (similar mechanism to [[Bennett's fracture]]).

### Clinical Features
*   **Pain** and **swelling** over the base of the [[thumb]].
*   **Tenderness** over the dorsum of the [[thumb]].
*   Loss of [[thumb]] function.
*   Deformity may be present depending on the severity of displacement.

### Radiographic Evaluation
*   **Plain X-rays:** [[Anteroposterior view]] (AP), Lateral, and Oblique views of the [[thumb]] are essential for diagnosis.
*   **Findings:**
    *   Shows a comminuted fracture at the base of the [[first metacarpal]].
    *   Classic appearance is a 'T' or 'Y' configuration of fracture lines entering the joint.

### Treatment and Management
Management depends on the degree of comminution. Unlike [[Bennett's fracture]], perfect anatomical reduction is often difficult to maintain and is considered less critical by some authorities, although accurate reduction is still the goal for large fragments.

#### 1. Conservative Management
*   **Indication:** Badly comminuted fractures where internal fixation is technically difficult or impossible.
*   **Method:** Immobilization in a [[thumb spica cast]] for **3 to 4 weeks**.
*   **Follow-up:** Gradual mobilization is started after the period of immobilization.

#### 2. Operative Management
*   **Indication:** Three-part fractures with large fragments.
*   **Methods:**
    *   **Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF):** Using [[Kirschner wires]] (K-wires) or mini T-plates and screws.
    *   **Implants:** A **'T' type [[Buttress plate]]** is specifically noted for use in Rolando's fracture.
*   **Post-operative:** Immobilization in a [[thumb spica]] followed by mobilization after 2–3 weeks depending on stability.

### Complications and Prognosis
The prognosis for Rolando fracture is generally **poor** compared to other thumb fractures.

*   **[[Osteoarthritis]]:** Degenerative arthritis of the [[carpometacarpal joint]] is a common complication due to articular surface damage.
*   **Joint Stiffness:** Loss of mobility of the [[carpometacarpal joint]] of the [[thumb]] due to prolonged immobilization.
*   **Late Management:** If degenerative arthritis becomes symptomatic, it may require [[arthroplasty]] or [[arthrodesis]] (fusion).

### Comparison: Bennett's vs. Rolando Fracture

| Feature | [[Bennett's Fracture]] | [[Rolando Fracture]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | Fracture-dislocation of the base of [[first metacarpal]] | Comminuted intra-articular fracture of base of [[first metacarpal]] |
| **Fracture Pattern** | Two-part fracture (Small volar fragment + Shaft) | Three-part or Comminuted ('T' or 'Y' shape) |
| **Reduction** | Anatomical reduction is essential | Perfect reduction is difficult; alignment is prioritized |
| **Treatment** | Usually Percutaneous pinning or ORIF | Thumb Spica (if comminuted) or ORIF (if large fragments) |
