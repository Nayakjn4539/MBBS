# Asphyxia

### Definition
**Etymology:** The term **Asphyxia** is derived from the Greek words *‘a’* (without) and *‘sphyxis’* (pulse), literally translating to **"pulselessness"** or "absence of pulse",,.

**Medical Definition:** It is a condition caused by interference with respiration or due to lack of oxygen in respired air, resulting in failure of uptake of oxygen by tissues (hypoxia/anoxia) together with failure to eliminate carbon dioxide (hypercapnia),.
*   It signifies a **mode of dying** rather than a specific cause of death.
*   It indicates **defective aeration of blood**.

### Pathophysiology
The sequence of physiological failure typically follows a vicious cycle:
1.  **Hypoxia** (Reduced O₂ tension).
2.  **Capillary dilatation** and stasis.
3.  **Capillo-venous engorgement** (Stasis of blood in organs).
4.  Diminished venous return to the heart.
5.  Reduced pulmonary blood flow $\rightarrow$ Further deficient oxygenation,.

### Classification of Asphyxia
Asphyxia is broadly classified based on the causative mechanism.

#### 1. Mechanical Asphyxia
Caused by physical/mechanical interference with the passage of air into the respiratory tract,. This is the most important category in [[Forensic Medicine]].

*   **Closure of External Orifices (Nose & Mouth):**
    *   **[[Smothering]]:** Closure by hand, cloth, pillow, or plastic bag,.
    *   **[[Overlaying]]:** Accidental smothering of an infant by an adult rolling over them during sleep.
    *   **[[Gagging]]:** Blocking the mouth/throat with a cloth or gag to prevent speech/breathing.
*   **Occlusion of Airway from Within:**
    *   **[[Choking]]:** Obstruction of the larynx/trachea by a foreign body (e.g., food bolus, coin).
    *   **[[Café Coronary]]:** Sudden collapse while eating, often mistaken for a heart attack, caused by food impaction.
    *   **[[Burking]]:** A combination of smothering and traumatic asphyxia (sitting on the chest while closing the nose/mouth).
*   **Compression of the Neck:**
    *   **[[Hanging]]:** Constricting force is the weight of the body.
    *   **[[Strangulation]]:** Constricting force is external (ligature, hands).
        *   **Ligature Strangulation:** Using a rope/cord.
        *   **Throttling (Manual Strangulation):** Compression by human hands.
        *   **[[Garrotting]]:** Strangulation using a ligature tightened by a twisting stick/lever.
        *   **[[Mugging]]:** Compression of the neck by the bend of the elbow/forearm.
        *   **[[Bansdola]]:** Compression of the neck between two bamboo sticks.
*   **Compression of Chest/Abdomen:**
    *   **[[Traumatic Asphyxia]]:** Fixation of the chest by heavy weight (e.g., stampede, wall collapse) preventing respiratory movements.
*   **Positional Causes:**
    *   **[[Positional Asphyxia]]:** Body position interferes with respiration (e.g., jack-knife position, inverted suspension),.

#### 2. Pathological Asphyxia
Due to disease of the upper respiratory tract preventing air entry.
*   Acute edema of glottis (anaphylaxis).
*   Laryngeal spasm.
*   Retropharyngeal abscess.
*   Tumors/Bronchitis.

#### 3. Toxic Asphyxia
Caused by chemical agents preventing oxygen utilization,.
*   **Prevention of O₂ transport:** [[Carbon Monoxide Poisoning]] (forms Carboxyhemoglobin).
*   **Blocking cellular enzymes (Histotoxic):** [[Cyanide Poisoning]] (Cytochrome oxidase inhibition).
*   **Paralysis of Respiratory Centre:** [[Opium]], [[Barbiturates]], [[Strychnine]].
*   **Paralysis of Respiratory Muscles:** Gelsemium.

#### 4. Environmental Asphyxia
Due to insufficient oxygen in the ambient atmosphere.
*   High altitude.
*   Entrapment in enclosed spaces (e.g., old trunks, refrigerators).
*   Inhalation of irrespirable gases (Sewer gas/CO₂).

#### 5. Traumatic Asphyxia (Internal)
*   **[[Pulmonary Embolism]]:** Thrombus blocking pulmonary arteries.
*   **Air Embolism.**
*   **Fat Embolism.**
*   **Bilateral Pneumothorax**.

#### 6. Iatrogenic Asphyxia
*   Associated with anaesthesia failure or complications.

#### 7. Sexual Asphyxia
*   **[[Autoerotic Asphyxia]]:** Intentional restriction of oxygen to the brain for sexual arousal (hypoxyphilia), often involving hanging or plastic bags.

### Phases of Asphyxia
When the airway is completely occluded, the body goes through specific stages,:

| Stage | Duration | Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Dyspnoea** | ~ 1 min | Air hunger, rapid breathing (inspiratory effort), cyanosis, tachycardia, rise in BP. |
| **2. Convulsions** | ~ 1 min | Expiratory effort, generalized clonic convulsions, loss of consciousness, sphincter relaxation. |
| **3. Exhaustion** | ~ 1-2 mins | Muscles relax (flaccidity), respiration becomes gasping and stops (apnoea), BP falls, heart continues to beat for some time then stops. |

**Mnemonic for Phases:** **D**octors **C**ure **E**xhaustion (**D**yspnoea, **C**onvulsions, **E**xhaustion).

### Signs of Asphyxia
These signs are non-specific but highly suggestive when found in combination with a history of trauma or obstruction.

#### The "Classic Triad" of Asphyxia
1.  **[[Cyanosis]]:** Blue discoloration due to reduced hemoglobin (>5g/100ml) in capillary blood. Seen in lips, nail beds, tongue.
2.  **[[Petechial Hemorrhages]] (Tardieu Spots):** Pinpoint hemorrhages due to rupture of capillaries caused by raised venous pressure. Common in sub-conjunctiva, sub-pleura, and sub-epicardium,.
3.  **Visceral Congestion:** Engorgement of organs due to venous stasis.

#### The "Asphyxial Quintet"
Added to the classic triad are:
4.  **[[Postmortem Fluidity of Blood]]:** Blood remains liquid due to fibrinolysins.
5.  **Right Ventricular Enlargement:** Due to pulmonary hypertension/congestion.

### Autopsy Findings

**External Findings:**
*   **Cyanosis:** Face, lips, fingernails.
*   **Petechiae:** Eyes (conjunctiva), face, behind ears.
*   **Postmortem Lividity:** Often dark, well-developed, and appears early.
*   **Rigor Mortis:** Often appears early due to convulsions (ATP depletion).
*   **Specific Marks:** Ligature marks (in hanging/strangulation), crescentic nail marks (throttling).

**Internal Findings:**
*   **Blood:** Dark and fluid.
*   **Lungs:** Congested, heavy, edematous. Sub-pleural petechiae (Tardieu spots) are characteristic.
*   **Heart:** Right side distended with blood; left side empty. Sub-epicardial petechiae.
*   **Organs:** Generalized congestion of liver, spleen, kidneys, and brain.

### Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Cause of Death:** Must be differentiated from natural causes (like heart failure) which can mimic asphyxial signs.
*   **Manner of Death:**
    *   **Suicide:** Common in hanging.
    *   **Homicide:** Common in throttling, strangulation, and smothering.
    *   **Accident:** Common in choking (food), traumatic asphyxia (crush injuries), and drowning.
*   **Artefacts:** Postmortem congestion or gravitational settling of blood can mimic asphyxial signs; dissection artefacts in the neck can mimic hemorrhage.
