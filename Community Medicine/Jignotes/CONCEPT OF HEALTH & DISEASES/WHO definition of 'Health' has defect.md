# [[CONCEPT OF HEALTH & DISEASES]] > WHO definition of 'Health' has defect

### Defects in the WHO Definition of Health

The widely accepted definition of [[Health]] given by the **World Health Organization (WHO)** in 1948 states:
*"Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely an absence of disease or infirmity."*

While this definition is broad and positive, it has faced significant criticism for several specific **defects**:

#### 1. Utopian and Idealistic
*   **The Problem:** The use of the word **"complete"** makes the definition overly ambitious.
*   **Explanation:** Perfect or complete physical, mental, and social well-being is rarely achieved by anyone for a sustained period. Therefore, based on this strict definition, almost **no one** would be considered truly healthy.
*   **Critique:** It is viewed as an **"idealistic goal"** rather than a **"realistic proposition"**.

#### 2. Static Concept
*   **The Problem:** The definition refers to health as a **"state"**.
*   **Explanation:** Health is **not static**; it is a **dynamic phenomenon**. It is a process of continuous adjustment to the changing demands of life and the environment.
*   **Critique:** A person’s health fluctuates frequently within a [[Spectrum of Health]], rather than staying in a fixed "state".

#### 3. Lack of Operational Value (Not Measurable)
*   **The Problem:** It is **not an "operational definition"**.
*   **Explanation:** The terms "complete well-being" are abstract and subjective (similar to happiness). They do not lend themselves to direct measurement like blood pressure or height.
*   **Critique:** Because it cannot be easily measured, it hampers the epidemiological study of health and the collection of statistical data.

#### 4. Broad and Subjective
*   **The Problem:** Subjectivity.
*   **Explanation:** Concepts like "social well-being" vary significantly between different cultures and individuals. What is considered "well-being" in one society may differ in another.

### Recent Amplification (The Fix)
To make the definition more practical, it was amplified (updated) to include:
*   **"An ability to lead a [[socially and economically productive life]]."**
*   This addition moves the concept closer to a practical standard, emphasizing that health is a resource for everyday life, not just the object of living.

### Mnemonic
To remember the defects of the WHO definition, think of **"ISO"**:

*   **I** – **I**dealistic (Utopian goal)
*   **S** – **S**tatic (Uses the word "state" instead of dynamic process)
*   **O** – Not **O**perational (Cannot be measured directly)

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Operational Definitions:** Because the WHO definition is hard to measure, researchers and clinicians use **Operational Definitions** of health. For example, in a narrow sense, health is measured by conformity to anatomical and physiological norms (e.g., normal lab values) and the absence of obvious disease.
*   **Spectrum of Health:** Clinicians recognize that health and disease lie on a continuum. A person is not just "healthy" or "sick"; they move between positive health, unrecognized sickness, mild sickness, and severe sickness.
