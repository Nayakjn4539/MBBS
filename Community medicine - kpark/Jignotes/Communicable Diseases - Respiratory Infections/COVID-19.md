# [[Communicable Diseases - Respiratory Infections]] > COVID-19

# [[COVID-19]] (Coronavirus Disease 2019)

**COVID-19** is an infectious disease caused by the [[SARS-CoV-2]] virus. It was declared a [[Pandemic]] by the WHO on 11th March 2020.

### Epidemiological Determinants

**1. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** [[SARS-CoV-2]] (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2).
*   **Classification:** Betacoronavirus; Single-stranded RNA virus (+ss RNA) with a crown-like appearance (Spike proteins).
*   **Resistance:** Sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat. Effectively inactivated by lipid solvents (ether, ethanol, chlorine, chloroform).
*   **Variants:** Viruses constantly change through mutation. Notable variants include Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron.

**2. Host Factors**
*   **Susceptibility:** Universal (no pre-existing immunity).
*   **High Risk for Severe Disease:**
    *   Age > 60 years.
    *   Comorbidities: Diabetes, Hypertension, Cardiac disease, Chronic lung/kidney disease, Cancer.
    *   Immunosuppression (including [[HIV]]).
    *   Obesity and Smoking.

**3. Environmental Factors**
*   Crowded, enclosed spaces facilitate transmission.
*   Cold temperature may favor virus survival.

### Transmission Dynamics

*   **Modes of Transmission:**
    *   **Respiratory Droplets:** Primary mode. Expelled via coughing/sneezing/talking. Risk is highest within 1 meter (close contact).
    *   **Aerosol (Airborne):** Droplet nuclei (<5 $\mu$m) can remain suspended in air.
    *   **Fomites:** Contact with contaminated surfaces followed by touching eyes, nose, or mouth.
*   **[[Incubation Period]]:** 2–14 days (Median 5-6 days).
*   **Period of Communicability:**
    *   1–3 days *before* symptom onset (Pre-symptomatic transmission).
    *   Viral load peaks around symptom onset.
    *   Rt-PCR positivity lasts 1-2 weeks in mild cases, longer in severe cases.

### Clinical Picture

The spectrum ranges from asymptomatic to severe pneumonia and death.

**Common Symptoms:**
*   Fever (83-99%)
*   Cough (Dry)
*   Fatigue
*   **Specific Signs:** Loss of smell ([[Anosmia]]) and Loss of taste ([[Ageusia]]).

**Disease Severity Classification:**
*   **Mild:** Uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection. No hypoxia.
*   **Moderate:** Pneumonia with **SpO2 90–93%** on room air, Respiratory Rate $\ge$ 24/min.
*   **Severe:** Severe Pneumonia with **SpO2 < 90%** on room air, Respiratory Rate > 30/min.
*   **Critical:** [[Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome]] (ARDS), Sepsis, Septic Shock.

**Complications:**
*   **[[Long COVID]] / Post-COVID Conditions:** Symptoms lasting weeks/months after infection (Fatigue, Brain fog, Dyspnea).
*   **[[Mucormycosis]] (Black Fungus):** Rare fungal infection in diabetics/steroid users characterized by black eschar and tissue necrosis.

### Diagnosis

1.  **RT-PCR ([[Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction]]):**
    *   **Gold Standard** for diagnosis.
    *   **CT Value (Cycle Threshold):**
        *   < 25: High viral load.
        *   25–35: Moderate viral load.
        *   > 35: Negative.
2.  **Rapid Antigen Test (RAT):** Point-of-care test. High specificity but lower sensitivity than PCR.
3.  **HRCT Chest:** Findings include ground-glass opacities (GGO) and "reversed halo sign".

### Management

**General Strategy:**
*   **[[Isolation]]:** Separation of positive cases to break the chain of transmission.
*   **[[Quarantine]]:** Restriction of activities of healthy contacts (usually 14 days).

**Treatment Guidelines:**

| Severity | Setting | Management Key Points |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mild** | Home Isolation / Covid Care Center | Symptomatic (Paracetamol, hydration). Monitoring of SpO2 and temperature. |
| **Moderate** | Dedicated Covid Health Centre (DCHC) | Oxygen support (Target SpO2 92-96%). Anticoagulants ([[Low Molecular Weight Heparin]]). Corticosteroids (e.g., Methylprednisolone/Dexamethasone). Awake Proning. |
| **Severe** | Dedicated Covid Hospital (ICU) | High flow oxygen/Ventilatory support. Steroids. Management of complications (ARDS, Shock). |

*Note: Investigational therapies like [[Remdesivir]] and Tocilizumab are used in specific subgroups under medical supervision.*

### Prevention and Vaccines

**1. COVID Appropriate Behavior:**
*   Mask usage.
*   Physical distancing (6 feet / "Do gaj ki doori").
*   Hand hygiene (Sanitizer/Soap).

**2. [[COVID-19 Vaccines]]:**
Vaccination is the most effective tool for prevention.

| Vaccine Name | Type | Manufacturer | Route/Dose | Storage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Covishield]]** | Viral Vector (Recombinant ChAdOx1) | Serum Institute of India | IM (0.5 ml) | 2-8°C |
| **[[Covaxin]]** | Whole Virion Inactivated (Killed) | Bharat Biotech | IM (0.5 ml) | 2-8°C |
| **Sputnik V** | Human Adenovirus Vector | Dr. Reddy's (Imported) | IM (0.5 ml) | 2-8°C |
| **Corbevax** | Protein Subunit | Biological E | IM (0.5 ml) | 2-8°C |
| **ZyCoV-D** | DNA Vaccine | Zydus Cadila | Intradermal | 2-8°C |
| **iNCOVACC** | Intranasal Adenovirus Vector | Bharat Biotech | Intranasal | 2-8°C |

*   **Contraindications:** History of anaphylaxis to previous dose or vaccine ingredients.
*   **Pregnancy:** Vaccines are recommended for pregnant and lactating women.
