# [[Stenopaeic Slit]]

### Description
The **Stenopaeic Slit** (or Stenopeic Slit) is an accessory disc used in the trial frame during ophthalmic examination.
*   **Structure:** It consists of an elongated, rectangular slit aperture, typically **1 mm** in width,.
*   **Principle:** It acts based on the **pin-hole principle**, but restricted to a single meridian. It increases the depth of focus in the meridian of the slit while allowing blur in the perpendicular meridian.
*   **Function:** It effectively isolates a single meridian of the dioptric system of the eye, allowing light rays to pass only through that specific axis.

### Uses and Clinical Applications

#### 1. Refraction (Diagnosis of [[Astigmatism]])
While largely replaced by [[Retinoscopy]] and [[Keratometry]], it is a useful subjective test for determining the power and axis of astigmatism, especially in cases of **irregular astigmatism** where standard methods fail.

*   **Procedure:**
    1.  The slit is placed before the eye and rotated slowly through 360°.
    2.  **Detection:** If the patient sees the test chart clearly at a specific position, astigmatism is present. The position where the image is clearest corresponds to one of the principal meridians,.
    3.  **Refraction:** The strongest convex (or weakest concave) lens that provides the best vision is found for this axis. The slit is then rotated 90° (to the secondary meridian), and the refraction is repeated.
    4.  **Calculation:** The difference between the powers found in the two principal meridians represents the cylindrical power required.

#### 2. Fincham's Test (Differentiation of Halos)
This is a critical clinical test to differentiate between halos caused by **[[Acute Congestive Glaucoma]]** (corneal edema) and those caused by **[[Cataract]]** (lenticular changes),.

*   **Procedure:** The stenopaeic slit is passed across the line of vision/pupil while the patient looks at a distant light source.

| Feature | [[Glaucomatous Halo]] | [[Lenticular Halo]] (Cataract) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pathology** | Due to fluid accumulation in corneal epithelium and alteration in refractive condition of corneal lamellae. | Due to prismatic effect of lens fibers (radial arrangement) or early cataractous changes. |
| **Reaction to Slit** | The halo remains **intact** (complete circle) but may diminish in intensity,. | The halo is **broken up into segments**. |
| **Movement** | Does not revolve. | The segments **revolve** as the slit is moved across the pupil,. |

#### 3. Pre-operative Assessment for [[Optical Iridectomy]]
In cases of **[[Corneal Opacity]]**, the stenopaeic slit is used to determine the best site for an optical iridectomy (a surgical procedure to create a new pupillary opening).

*   **Procedure:** The slit is rotated in front of the eye.
*   **Interpretation:** The meridian where the patient reports the best visual acuity indicates the clearest part of the cornea. The iridectomy is planned along this meridian.
*   **Note:** Usually, the inferonasal quadrant is preferred for near work and superotemporal for distant work, but the slit test confirms the most functional optical zone.

#### 4. Low Vision Aid
*   It can be used as a simple low vision aid to improve contrast and focus in patients with significant optical aberrations or irregular corneas.
