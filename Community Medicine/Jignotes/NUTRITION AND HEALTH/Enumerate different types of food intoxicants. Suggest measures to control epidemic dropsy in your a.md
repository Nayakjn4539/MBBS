# Food Intoxicants

Food intoxications are illnesses caused by the ingestion of toxins present in the food. These toxins may be naturally occurring, produced by microorganisms, or chemical contaminants.

### Classification of Food Intoxicants

The various types of food intoxicants can be classified as follows:

| Category | Disease/Condition | Causative Agent/Toxin | Associated Food Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Naturally Occurring Toxins** | **[[Neurolathyrism]]** | **BOAA** (Beta-oxalyl-amino-alanine) | **Khesari Dal** (*Lathyrus sativus*) consumed in large quantities (>30%) for 2-6 months. |
| | **[[Epidemic Dropsy]]** | **Sanguinarine** (Toxic alkaloid) | Mustard oil contaminated with **Argemone oil** (*Argemone mexicana*). |
| | **[[Endemic Ascites]]** | **Pyrrolizidine alkaloids** | Millet contaminated with *Crotalaria* seeds (Jhunjhunia). |
| **Fungal Toxins (Mycotoxins)** | **[[Aflatoxicosis]]** | **Aflatoxins** (B1, G1) produced by *Aspergillus flavus* | Groundnuts, maize, parboiled rice stored in humid conditions. |
| | **[[Ergotism]]** | **Ergot alkaloids** (Clavine) produced by *Claviceps fusiformis* | Infested food grains like **Bajra**, rye, sorghum, and wheat. |
| | **Fusarium Toxicity** | Trichothecenes | Sorghum/Rice contaminated by *Fusarium incarnatum*. |
| **Bacterial Toxins** | **[[Botulism]]** | **Exotoxin** of *Clostridium botulinum* (Neurotoxin) | Canned foods, smoked fish, fermented foods. |
| | **Staphylococcal Poisoning** | **Enterotoxin** (Heat stable) | Milk products, custards, salads. |
| **Chemical Toxicants** | **Heavy Metal Poisoning** | Mercury, Lead, Cadmium, Arsenic | Fish (Mercury), Pesticides, Industrial effluents. |
| | **Pesticide Residues** | Organophosphates, DDT | Agricultural produce. |

### Epidemic Dropsy

**Epidemic dropsy** is a food-borne intoxication caused by the consumption of edible oils (usually mustard oil) contaminated with **Argemone oil**.

*   **Causative Agent:** *Argemone mexicana* (Prickly poppy) seeds which resemble mustard seeds.
*   **Toxic Alkaloid:** **[[Sanguinarine]]**.
*   **Pathophysiology:** Sanguinarine interferes with the oxidation of **pyruvic acid**, leading to capillary dilatation and increased permeability.

**Clinical Features (Mnemonics: E-G-G)**
*   **E**dema (Bilateral pitting edema of legs).
*   **G**astrointestinal symptoms (Diarrhea, vomiting).
*   **G**laucoma and Cardiac failure (Breathlessness).
*   *Also:* Erythema and tenderness of the skin.

#### Measures to Control Epidemic Dropsy

To control an outbreak in a community, the following measures must be implemented immediately:

**1. Identification and Stop Source**
*   **Stop Consumption:** Immediately seize and ban the sale/distribution of the suspected batch of mustard oil or edible oil in the affected area.
*   **Alert the Public:** Use mass media (mics, pamphlets) to educate the community not to consume loose mustard oil and to look for specific symptoms.

**2. Testing and Surveillance**
*   **Chemical Tests:** Conduct rapid chemical tests to detect argemone oil in mustard oil samples.
    *   **Nitric Acid Test:** Add nitric acid to the oil sample and shake. Development of a **brown to orange-red color** indicates the presence of argemone oil.
    *   **Paper Chromatography Test:** This is the **most sensitive test** to detect even minute quantities (0.0001%) of argemone oil.
*   **[[Epidemiological Investigation]]:** Trace the source of the oil distribution chain (wholesalers, retailers) to identify the point of contamination.

**3. Agricultural Control (Source Reduction)**
*   **De-weeding:** Farmers should be educated to remove *Argemone mexicana* plants (which look like prickly poppies with yellow flowers) growing as weeds among mustard crops before harvesting.
*   **Prevention of accidental mixing:** Ensure that argemone seeds (which are black and resemble mustard seeds) are not harvested along with mustard seeds.

**4. Legal Enforcement**
*   **Strict Enforcement of Acts:** Rigorous application of the **[[Food Safety and Standards Act]] (FSSA)** and Prevention of Food Adulteration provisions to punish unscrupulous dealers mixing cheaper argemone oil with mustard oil.
*   **Ban on Loose Oil:** Enforcement of the sale of oil only in sealed packages/containers to prevent adulteration at the retail level.
