# Diseases of the Vitreous: Liquefaction and Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD)

## 1. Vitreous Liquefaction (Synchysis)

**Definition:**
[[Vitreous Liquefaction]], also known as **Synchysis**, is the most common degenerative change in the vitreous body where the vitreous gel loses its fine fibrillar structure and converts into a liquid state (sol).

**Etiology:**
*   **Senile (Age-related):** Most common cause; occurs frequently after the age of 50 years.
*   **Degenerative Myopia:** Liquefaction occurs at an earlier age in myopes.
*   **Post-inflammatory:** Following [[Uveitis]] (e.g., pars planitis, posterior uveitis).
*   **Trauma:** Mechanical (blunt or perforating), Thermal (diathermy/photocoagulation), or Radiational.
*   **Retinal Dystrophies:** Associated with [[Retinitis Pigmentosa]].

**Clinical Features:**
*   **Slit-lamp Biomicroscopy:**
    *   Absence of normal fine fibrillar structure.
    *   Visible "pockets" of liquefaction.
    *   Appearance of coarse aggregate material moving freely within the fluid vitreous.

## 2. Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD)

**Definition:**
[[Posterior Vitreous Detachment]] refers to the separation of the [[Cortical Vitreous]] from the [[Internal Limiting Membrane]] (ILM) of the retina anywhere posterior to the **vitreous base**.

**Epidemiology and Risk Factors:**
*   **Age:** Common in individuals >65 years (65% of population).
*   **Refractive Status:** Occurs earlier and more frequently in [[Myopia]].
*   **Lens Status:** More common in [[Aphakia]] (post-ICCE) than phakic eyes.
*   **Systemic Disease:** Common in [[Diabetes Mellitus]].,

### Pathogenesis
The development of PVD involves two concurrent processes:
1.  **Synchysis (Liquefaction):** The vitreous gel becomes liquid.
2.  **Syneresis (Collapse):** The collagen fibrils condense and the vitreous mass shrinks.

**Mechanism:**
*   Synchytic fluid collects between the **posterior hyaloid membrane** and the ILM of the retina.
*   This leads to the separation of the posterior hyaloid face from the retina.
*   The detachment extends up to the **vitreous base** (a 3-4 mm zone at the ora serrata where attachment is strongest).

### Clinical Features

**Symptoms:**
*   **Floaters (Muscae Volitantes):**
    *   *Sudden onset* of moving black spots.
    *   Patients describe them as "cobwebs," "strings," or a "transparent ring" or "saucer".
    *   Caused by condensed vitreous fibrils, blood, or the detached attachment to the optic disc.
*   **Photopsia (Flashes of Light):**
    *   Caused by mechanical stimulation (traction) of the retina by the separating vitreous.
    *   Usually noticed in the temporal visual field.
    *   Provoked by ocular movements.,

**Signs:**
*   **Weiss Ring (Fuchs Ring):** A pathognomonic sign. It appears as a ring-like opacity suspended in the vitreous, representing the detached annular attachment of the vitreous to the margins of the [[Optic Disc]].,
*   **Vitreous Examination:**
    *   Collapsed vitreous behind the lens.
    *   Optically clear space between the detached posterior hyaloid face and the retina.
*   **Shafer's Sign (Tobacco Dust):** Presence of brown pigment cells in the anterior vitreous. Indicates a retinal break (RPE cells released).

### Complications of PVD
While often benign, the dynamic traction forces during PVD can cause significant pathology at sites of strong vitreoretinal adhesion:

1.  **Retinal Breaks/Tears:** Occurs if the vitreous pulls a piece of retina with it. Common in the upper temporal quadrant.
2.  **Vitreous Hemorrhage (VH):** Caused by the tearing of a retinal blood vessel during separation.
3.  **Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment (RRD):** Fluid enters through the retinal break into the subretinal space.
4.  **Macular Disorders:**
    *   [[Cystoid Macular Edema]] (due to traction).
    *   **Macular Hole:** Due to avulsion of the fovea.
    *   **Epiretinal Membrane:** Due to proliferation of glial cells.

### Management

| Condition | Management Strategy |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Uncomplicated PVD** | **Reassurance.** No treatment required. Explain that floaters may persist but become less bothersome (neuroadaptation). |
| **PVD with Retinal Tear** | **Laser Photocoagulation** (Barrage laser) or Cryotherapy to seal the break and prevent RD. |
| **PVD with Vitreous Hemorrhage** | Ultrasound B-scan to rule out RD. Bed rest, head elevation. Vitrectomy if non-resolving (>3 months). |
| **PVD with Retinal Detachment** | Urgent Surgical Repair (Scleral buckling or Vitrectomy). |

**Clinical Implication:**
Every patient presenting with sudden onset **floaters** and **flashes** must undergo a thorough **dilated fundus examination** with scleral depression to rule out peripheral retinal tears or detachment. The patient must be given a **"Retinal Detachment Warning"** (return immediately if a curtain/shadow appears or floaters increase).
