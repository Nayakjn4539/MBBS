# [[Proximal Humerus Fractures]]

Fractures of the proximal humerus are common injuries, particularly affecting the elderly population with osteoporotic bone. They account for approximately 4–5% of all fractures.

### **Epidemiology and Mechanism of Injury**

*   **Demographics:**
    *   **Elderly:** Most common in patients >60 years (Osteoporotic individuals).
    *   **Young Adults:** Usually associated with high-energy trauma.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **Low Energy:** Fall on an outstretched hand (FOOSH) from standing height (most common).
    *   **High Energy:** Road traffic accidents, fall from height, or direct blow to the lateral aspect of the arm.
    *   **Electric Shock/Seizures:** Can cause posterior fracture-dislocation.

### **Relevant Surgical Anatomy**

Codman described the four major segments of the [[proximal humerus]] based on epiphyseal lines. These fragments are held together by the rotator cuff and soft tissues but pulled apart by specific muscle forces when fractured.

#### **The Four Segments**
1.  **Head:** The articular surface (bounded by the anatomical neck).
2.  **Greater Tuberosity:** Attachment for [[Supraspinatus]], [[Infraspinatus]], and [[Teres Minor]].
3.  **Lesser Tuberosity:** Attachment for [[Subscapularis]].
4.  **Shaft:** Bounded proximally by the surgical neck.

#### **Deforming Muscular Forces**
| Fragment | Muscle Attached | Direction of Pull |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Greater Tuberosity]]** | Supraspinatus/Infraspinatus | Superiorly and Posteriorly |
| **[[Lesser Tuberosity]]** | Subscapularis | Medially |
| **[[Humeral Shaft]]** | Pectoralis Major | Medially (Adduction) |

**Clinical Implication:** The **surgical neck** is the most common site of fracture. The **anatomical neck** is the site of entry for blood vessels; fractures here carry a high risk of [[Avascular Necrosis]] (AVN).

### **Clinical Features**

*   **Symptoms:** Severe pain, swelling, and inability to move the shoulder.
*   **Inspection:**
    *   Patient typically supports the injured arm with the opposite hand.
    *   **Ecchymosis:** Extensive bruising may appear on the chest wall and arm (gravity causes blood to track down) – often appearing 24–48 hours later (**Hennequin's ecchymosis**).
*   **Palpation:** Tenderness over the proximal humerus.
*   **Neurological Examination:**
    *   **[[Axillary Nerve]]:** Most commonly injured nerve. Check for sensation over the "Regimental Badge" area (lateral aspect of the shoulder) and deltoid contraction (though difficult to test due to pain).
    *   **[[Brachial Plexus]]:** Check distal pulses and sensation.

### **Imaging**

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> X-ray series of the shoulder including AP, Scapular Y, and Axillary views

**1. Radiographs (Trauma Series):**
*   **AP View (Anteroposterior):** Standard view (in Scapular plane).
*   **Scapular Y Lateral View:** To check for dislocation.
*   **Axillary View:** Essential to determine the relationship of the head to the glenoid (rules out dislocation) and lesser tuberosity fractures. *Velpeau axillary view* can be used if the patient cannot abduct the arm.

**2. CT Scan:**
*   Indicated for complex comminuted fractures, preoperative planning, or to assess articular involvement.

### **Classification: Neer’s Classification**

This is the standard system used for treatment planning. It is based on the **number of displaced parts**, not just the number of fracture lines.

**Definition of Displacement:**
A part is considered "displaced" only if:
1.  Angulation is **> 45 degrees**, OR
2.  Displacement/Separation is **> 1 cm**.

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **One-Part Fracture** | No fragments meet the displacement criteria (regardless of the number of fracture lines). The fragments are held together by soft tissue. |
| **Two-Part Fracture** | One segment is displaced (e.g., Surgical neck #, or Greater Tuberosity #). |
| **Three-Part Fracture** | Surgical neck + one tuberosity (Greater or Lesser) are displaced. |
| **Four-Part Fracture** | Surgical neck + both tuberosities are displaced. The head is detached from blood supply. |
| **Fracture-Dislocation** | Any of the above associated with glenohumeral dislocation. |

### **Management**

Treatment depends on patient age, bone quality, and fracture type (Neer’s classification).

#### **1. Conservative Management**
*   **Indication:** Minimally displaced fractures (Neer’s One-Part), which constitute nearly 80% of cases.
*   **Method:**
    *   Immobilization in a **poly-sling** or **collar and cuff**.
    *   Velpeau bandage may be used.
    *   **Rehabilitation:** Early passive exercises (Pendulum exercises) started within 1–2 weeks to prevent [[Frozen Shoulder]]. Active motion starts after clinical union (4–6 weeks).

#### **2. Operative Management**
**Indications:** Displaced fractures (2, 3, or 4-part), open fractures, vascular injury, or failure of conservative care.

| Fracture Pattern | Surgical Option |
| :--- | :--- |
| **2-Part / 3-Part** | **[[ORIF]] (Open Reduction Internal Fixation):**<br>- **Locking Plate (PHILOS):** Preferred for osteoporotic bone.<br>- **Intramedullary Nail:** For surgical neck fractures combined with shaft fractures.<br>- **Suture Fixation/Tension Band:** For isolated tuberosity fractures. |
| **4-Part** | **[[Hemiarthroplasty]] (Shoulder Replacement):** In elderly patients where AVN risk is high.<br>**ORIF:** May be attempted in young patients to preserve the head.<br>**Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty:** Increasingly used for elderly with cuff pathology (though sources primarily emphasize Hemiarthroplasty). |
| **Head-Splitting** | **Prosthetic Replacement** (Hemiarthroplasty). |

### **Complications**

**1. Early Complications:**
*   **[[Axillary Nerve Injury]]:** Common in fracture-dislocations.
*   **Vascular Injury:** Axillary artery injury (rare but serious, especially in elderly with atherosclerosis).

**2. Late Complications:**
*   **[[Shoulder Stiffness]] (Adhesive Capsulitis):** The most common complication. Prevention requires early mobilization.
*   **[[Avascular Necrosis]] (AVN):**
    *   High risk in **4-part fractures** and **Anatomical neck fractures**.
    *   Occurs due to disruption of the arcuate artery (ascending branch of anterior circumflex humeral artery).
*   **[[Malunion]]:**
    *   *Greater tuberosity malunion* can cause subacromial impingement and block abduction.
    *   *Varus malunion* of the surgical neck.
*   **[[Nonunion]]:** Relatively rare in the surgical neck.
*   **[[Myositis Ossificans]]:** Can occur following vigorous massage or aggressive passive stretching.

**Clinical Tip:** In elderly patients, massive bruising down the arm and chest wall is alarming to the patient but usually resolves benignly. Reassurance is key.
