# [[Ear]] > Eustachian Tube

### **Eustachian Tube (Pharyngotympanic Tube)**

The [[Eustachian Tube]] (ET) is a channel connecting the nasopharynx to the tympanic cavity (middle ear). It acts as a pressure-equalizing valve and a drainage pipe for the middle ear cleft.

### **1. Embryology**
*   **Origin:** Develops from the **first pharyngeal pouch** (endoderm),.
*   **Development:** The proximal part of the pouch forms the tube, while the distal dilated part forms the middle ear cavity.

### **2. Anatomy**
**Dimensions and Course:**
*   **Length:** Approximately **36 mm** in adults,.
*   **Direction:** Runs downwards, forwards, and medially from the tympanic end to the nasopharynx,.
*   **Angle:** Forms an angle of **45°** with the horizontal plane in adults,.

**Parts:**
It consists of two unequal parts meeting at the **Isthmus** (narrowest point):
1.  **Bony Part (Posterolateral 1/3):**
    *   Length: Approx **12 mm**,.
    *   Location: Opens into the anterior wall of the middle ear.
    *   Relation: Medially related to the [[Internal Carotid Artery]].
2.  **Cartilaginous Part (Anteromedial 2/3):**
    *   Length: Approx **24 mm**,.
    *   Structure: Made of a single piece of cartilage folded to form the medial lamina, roof, and part of the lateral lamina. The rest is fibrous membrane.
    *   **[[Ostmann’s Pad of Fat]]:** A mass of fatty tissue located lateral to the membranous part. It helps keep the tube closed and prevents nasopharyngeal reflux,.

**Openings:**
*   **Tympanic Orifice:** Located in the anterior wall of the tympanic cavity, slightly above the floor,.
*   **Pharyngeal Orifice:** Located in the lateral wall of the nasopharynx, 1.25 cm behind the posterior end of the inferior turbinate,.
    *   **[[Torus Tubarius]]:** An elevation produced by the tubal cartilage at the pharyngeal end,.
    *   **[[Fossa of Rosenmuller]]:** A recess behind the tubal elevation (common site for nasopharyngeal carcinoma).

### **3. Histology (Lining Epithelium)**
The lining is continuous with the nasopharynx and middle ear but varies along the length,:
*   **Pharyngeal/Cartilaginous part:** Pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium with many mucous glands (Respiratory type),.
*   **Bony part:** Ciliated columnar epithelium with fewer glands.

### **4. Muscles Associated (Dynamics)**
Normally, the ET is **closed**. It opens actively during swallowing, yawning, and sneezing.

| Muscle | Action | Innervation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Tensor Veli Palatini]]** | **Primary Dilator**; opens the tube, | Mandibular Nerve (V3) |
| **[[Levator Veli Palatini]]** | Assists in opening; pushes medial lamina up | Pharyngeal Plexus (CN X) |
| **Salpingopharyngeus** | Assists in opening | Pharyngeal Plexus |
| **Tensor Tympani** | Originates from the bony tube; tenses TM | Mandibular Nerve (V3) |

### **5. Blood and Nerve Supply**
*   **Arterial Supply:**
    *   Ascending pharyngeal artery.
    *   Middle meningeal artery.
    *   Artery of the pterygoid canal.
*   **Venous Drainage:** Pterygoid venous plexus.
*   **Nerve Supply:**
    *   **Sensory:** Tympanic branch of the **Glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX)** supplies the mucosa,.
    *   **Motor:** Mandibular nerve (V3) for Tensor Veli Palatini.

### **6. Infant vs. Adult Eustachian Tube**
This comparison explains why children are more prone to [[Acute Otitis Media]],,.

| Feature | Infant / Child | Adult |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Length** | Short (~13–18 mm) | Long (~36 mm) |
| **Direction** | **Horizontal** (10° angle) | **Angulated** (45° angle) |
| **Lumen** | Wider | Narrower |
| **Cartilage** | Flaccid | Rigid |
| **Angulation at Isthmus** | Absent | Present |
| **Function** | Less efficient | Efficient |

### **7. Physiology (Functions)**
The ET has three major physiological functions,,:
1.  **Ventilation:** Regulation of middle ear pressure to match atmospheric pressure. Essential for optimal hearing (Impedance matching).
2.  **Protection:** Protects the middle ear from nasopharyngeal sound pressure and retrograde reflux of secretions (aided by Ostmann’s pad of fat),.
3.  **Clearance:** Mucociliary clearance drains middle ear secretions into the nasopharynx,.

### **8. Assessment of Eustachian Tube Function**
**Patency Tests:**
*   **[[Valsalva Maneuver]]:** Forced expiration with nose and mouth closed. Positive if the TM moves outward,.
*   **[[Toynbee Maneuver]]:** Swallowing with nose closed. Creates negative pressure.
*   **[[Politzerization]]:** Blowing air into the nose while the patient swallows.
*   **Eustachian Tube Catheterization:** Using a catheter to inflate the tube.
*   **[[Tympanometry]]:** Ideally assesses function.
    *   **Type A:** Normal function.
    *   **Type C:** Negative pressure (Dysfunction),.
    *   **Inflation-Deflation Test:** Swallowing attempts to equilibrate applied positive/negative pressure.
*   **Radiology/Endoscopy:** CT scan or nasal endoscopy to rule out masses,.

### **9. Clinical Implications**

**1. Eustachian Tube Dysfunction (ETD):**
*   **Obstruction:** Can be mechanical (Adenoids, Tumors, Polyp) or functional (Cleft palate—failure of Tensor Veli Palatini),.
*   **Sequelae:** Obstruction leads to negative middle ear pressure $\rightarrow$ Transudation of fluid ([[Serous Otitis Media]]) $\rightarrow$ Retraction of TM $\rightarrow$ [[Cholesteatoma]],,.
*   **Adenoids:** Enlarged adenoids in children mechanically block the ET and act as a reservoir of infection, leading to Recurrent Otitis Media or [[Otitis Media with Effusion]] (OME).

**2. [[Patulous Eustachian Tube]]:**
*   **Definition:** The tube remains abnormally open.
*   **Causes:** Rapid weight loss (loss of Ostmann's fat pad), pregnancy, multiple sclerosis,.
*   **Symptoms:** **[[Autophony]]** (patient hears their own voice/breath sounds loudly),.
*   **Sign:** Tympanic membrane moves with respiration (Hypermobile TM).

**3. Infections:**
*   **[[Acute Otitis Media]] (AOM):** Infection ascends from the nasopharynx to the middle ear via the ET. More common in infants due to the horizontal tube,.

**4. Barotrauma:**
*   Inability to equalize pressure during rapid descent (flying/diving) causes "locking" of the tube, leading to hemotympanum or effusion,.

### **Mnemonics**
*   **Muscles:** **T**ensor opens the **T**ube (**T**ensor veli palatini).
*   **Comparison:** **C**hild's tube is **C**ompressed (Shorter) and **F**lat (Horizontal).
