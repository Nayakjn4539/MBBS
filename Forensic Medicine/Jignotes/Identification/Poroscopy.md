# [[Identification]] > Poroscopy

### Poroscopy (Locard's Method)

**Definition**
[[Poroscopy]] is the specialized study of the number, size, shape, and relative position of the **pores of sweat glands** located on the friction ridges of the palmar surface of the hands and the plantar surface of the feet.

**History and Origin**
*   It was established and developed by the French criminologist **[[Edmond Locard]]** in 1912.
*   He demonstrated that like ridge patterns, the pores are also unique to an individual.

**Basic Principles**
1.  **Permanence:** The pores are permanent and immutable. They appear during intrauterine life and remain unchanged in position and shape until the skin is destroyed by decomposition after death.
2.  **Individuality:** No two individuals have the same pattern of pores.
3.  **Abundance:** There are approximately **9 to 18 pores per centimeter** of a ridge (some sources state 20–40 pores per cm).

**Parameters Studied**
When examining pores for identification, the following characteristics are compared:
*   **Size** of the pores (diameter).
*   **Shape** of the pores (round, elliptical, oval, square, or rhomboid).
*   **Number** (frequency) of pores per unit length of the ridge.
*   **Relative Position** of the pores on the ridge.

**Methodology**
*   **Comparison:** The pores in a latent print found at a crime scene are compared with an inked impression taken from the suspect.
*   **Enlargement:** Because pores are microscopic, the prints must be photographed and enlarged (photomicrography) to massive scales to visualize the pore details clearly.

**Medicolegal Importance**
*   **Fragmentary Prints:** Poroscopy is extremely valuable when only a **fragment** of a fingerprint is available (partial prints). In such cases, the number of ridge characteristics (minutiae) may be insufficient for a standard [[Dactylography]] match (usually requiring 8–16 points). However, a small fragment may contain hundreds of pores, providing enough data for positive identification.
*   **Corroboration:** It serves as a corroborative evidence to support fingerprint identification.

**Limitations**
*   **Print Quality:** It requires very high-quality latent prints. If the ink is too thick (smudged) or the pressure applied is too high, the pores may get obscured or filled, making analysis impossible.
*   **Technical Difficulty:** It is technically more difficult and time-consuming than standard ridge analysis.
