# [[Diseases Of Cornea]] > Acanthamoeba Keratitis

### Acanthamoeba Keratitis

**Acanthamoeba Keratitis** is a rare but vision-threatening parasitic infection of the [[cornea]], notoriously difficult to diagnose and treat. It is caused by the free-living protozoan *Acanthamoeba*.

#### Etiology and Pathogenesis
*   **Causative Agent:** [[Acanthamoeba]] (most commonly *A. castellanii* and *A. polyphaga*).
    *   **Forms:** Exists in two forms:
        1.  **Trophozoite:** Active, motile, infective form. Produces enzymes causing tissue destruction.
        2.  **Cyst:** Dormant, highly resilient form (double-walled). Capable of surviving adverse conditions and responsible for the difficulty in treatment and recurrences.
*   **Habitat:** Ubiquitous in nature (soil, fresh water, brackish water, sewage, swimming pools, hot tubs).
*   **Host Dependency:** Unlike many parasites, it does not require a human host to complete its life cycle.

#### Risk Factors
1.  **Contact Lens Wear (Most Common):** Accounts for ~90% of cases.
    *   Use of tap water/distilled water for cleaning lenses.
    *   Use of homemade saline solutions.
    *   Swimming or showering while wearing contact lenses.
2.  **Trauma:** Corneal injury with vegetable matter or organic material (mimics [[Fungal Keratitis]]).
3.  **Exposure to Contaminated Water:** Muddy water, hot tubs.
4.  **Immunocompromised State:** Opportunistic infection in patients with existing herpetic or bacterial keratitis.

#### Clinical Features
The clinical course is often widely variable, indolent, and protracted (evolving over months).

**Symptoms**
*   **Severe Ocular Pain:** The hallmark symptom. It is disproportionately severe compared to the clinical signs (due to [[Radial Keratoneuritis]]).
*   **Blurring of Vision:** Variable reduction depending on central involvement.
*   **Photophobia:** Significant sensitivity to light.
*   **Blepharospasm** and **Lacrimation**.

**Signs**
| Stage | Clinical Signs |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Early Manifestations** | • **Epithelial irregularities:** Punctate epithelial erosions, epithelial roughening.<br>• **Pseudodendrites:** Epithelial defects often mistaken for [[Herpes Simplex Keratitis]].<br>• **Radial Keratoneuritis:** Infiltration along corneal nerves (perineural infiltrates). This is pathognomonic.<br>• **Limbitis:** Inflammation at the limbus. |
| **Late Manifestations** | • **Ring Infiltrate/Abscess:** A partial or complete paracentral ring of stromal opacification (Pathognomonic).<br>• **Satellite Lesions:** Patchy stromal infiltrates separate from the main lesion.<br>• **Stromal Necrosis:** Can lead to corneal thinning and [[Descemetocele]].<br>• **Hypopyon:** Rare, but can occur in severe cases (often sterile).<br>• **Scleritis:** Anterior diffuse or nodular scleritis. |

#### Differential Diagnosis
1.  **Herpes Simplex Keratitis (HSV):** Due to the presence of pseudodendrites.
2.  **Fungal Keratitis:** Due to satellite lesions and history of trauma with vegetative matter.
3.  **Bacterial Keratitis:** Specifically *Pseudomonas* in contact lens wearers or *Nocardia*.

#### Investigations and Diagnosis
Diagnosis is often delayed due to mimicry of other conditions. High index of suspicion is required in non-responsive cases.

1.  **Clinical Diagnosis:** Based on disproportionate pain and specific signs (Ring infiltrate, Radial Keratoneuritis).
2.  **Confocal Microscopy:** Non-invasive *in vivo* visualization of highly reflective, double-walled **cysts** in the corneal stroma.
3.  **Corneal Scraping and Staining:**
    *   **Calcofluor White:** Fluorescent brightener that binds to chitin in the cyst wall; cysts appear bright apple-green under a fluorescence microscope.
    *   **KOH Wet Mount:** Can reveal cysts.
    *   **Giemsa or Gram Stain:** To identify cysts and trophozoites.
    *   **Lactophenol Cotton Blue.**
4.  **Culture:**
    *   **Non-nutrient Agar with E. coli overlay:** The *E. coli* serves as a food source for the amoeba. Trophozoites create "tracks" or trails on the agar plate as they consume the bacteria.
5.  **PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction):** Detection of Amoebic DNA (highly sensitive).
6.  **Corneal Biopsy:** Indicated if superficial scrapings are negative but clinical suspicion remains high.

#### Treatment
Treatment is difficult because the **cysts** are resistant to most drugs. Therapy is often prolonged (6 months to 1 year).

**Medical Management**
*   **Cysticidal Agents (Biguanides):** The mainstay of treatment.
    *   **PHMB** ([[Polyhexamethylene Biguanide]]) 0.02%.
    *   **Chlorhexidine** 0.02%.
*   **Diamidines:**
    *   [[Propamidine Isethionate]] (Brolene) 0.1%.
    *   Hexamidine.
*   **Aminoglycosides:** [[Neomycin]] (inhibits protein synthesis).
*   **Antifungals (Imidazoles):** Oral [[Ketoconazole]] or [[Itraconazole]] may be used as adjuncts.

*   **Regimen:**
    *   Topical drops are instilled hourly (day and night) for the first few days, then tapered slowly over months.
    *   Common combination: PHMB or Chlorhexidine + Propamidine.

**Surgical Management**
*   **Therapeutic Penetrating Keratoplasty (PK):**
    *   Indicated for medical treatment failure, impending perforation, or severe scarring.
    *   **Timing:** Best performed when the eye is quiet (quiescent phase) after months of medical therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence in the graft.
*   **Amniotic Membrane Transplantation:** To promote healing in persistent epithelial defects.

**Clinical Implication:** **Corticosteroids** are generally **contraindicated** in the acute phase as they inhibit the immune response and promote encystment of the amoeba, prolonging the infection. They may be used cautiously later to reduce severe inflammation.

#### Prevention
*   Proper **Contact Lens Hygiene**: Avoid tap water/homemade saline.
*   Disinfect lenses properly; use daily disposables if possible.
*   Avoid swimming/showering with contact lenses.
