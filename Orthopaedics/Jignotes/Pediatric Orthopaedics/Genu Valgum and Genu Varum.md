# [[Pediatric Orthopaedics]] > Genu Valgum and Genu Varum

# Genu Valgum and Genu Varum (Knock Knees and Bow Legs)

These are angular deformities of the knee in the coronal plane. Understanding the **physiological evolution** of the lower limb alignment is crucial to distinguish normal development from pathological conditions.

### 1. Terminology and Definitions

*   **[[Genu Varum]] (Bow Legs):**
    *   Deformity where the knees are widely separated when the ankles are brought together.
    *   The distal part (leg/tibia) deviates **towards the midline**.
    *   Associated with **Coxa Valga**.
*   **[[Genu Valgum]] (Knock Knees):**
    *   Deformity where the ankles are widely separated when the knees are brought together.
    *   The distal part (leg/tibia) deviates **away from the midline**.
    *   Associated with **Coxa Vara**.

**Mnemonic to Remember:**
*   **VaRum:** Knees are apart (like a **R**oom for a bottle of **R**um between legs).
*   **ValGum:** Knees stick together (like **G**um).

### 2. Physiological Evolution of Knee Alignment

The knee alignment changes naturally with age. Knowing this prevents unnecessary treatment of normal children.

| Age Group | Typical Alignment | Clinical Presentation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Birth to 18 months** | **Varus** (Bow legs) | Physiological Genu Varum. Due to intra-uterine position. |
| **18 to 24 months** | **Neutral** | Legs straighten out. |
| **3 to 4 years** | **Valgus** (Knock knees) | Physiological Genu Valgum. Maximum angulation occurs here. |
| **7 years to Adult** | **Mild Valgus** | Settles to adult normal (5–7° of valgus). |

**Clinical Implication:** Corrective treatment is rarely needed for deformities that follow this timeline unless they are unilateral, progressive, or severe.

### 3. Genu Valgum (Knock Knees)

#### Etiology
1.  **Idiopathic/Physiological:** Most common.
2.  **Metabolic:** [[Rickets]] (Nutritional or Renal), [[Osteomalacia]].
3.  **Traumatic:** 
    *   Fracture of the proximal tibia (Cozen's phenomenon).
    *   Lateral physeal injury.
4.  **Skeletal Dysplasias:** [[Morquio's Syndrome]], [[Hereditary Multiple Exostosis]] (exostosis near the joint/diaphyseal aclasis).
5.  **Infection:** Osteomyelitis damaging the lateral physis.
6.  **Others:** [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]] (Triple deformity), Paralytic (Polio - rare now).

#### Clinical Features
*   **Deformity:** Knees touch while ankles are apart.
*   **Gait:** Circumduction gait or clumsy walking; knees may rub against each other.
*   **Pain:** Usually painless in children; anterior knee pain (patellofemoral) in adolescents due to maltracking.
*   **Flat Foot:** often associated with genu valgum.

#### Assessment
*   **Inter-malleolar Distance:** Measure the distance between the medial malleoli when the knees are touching.
    *   **< 8 cm:** Mild/Physiological.
    *   **> 10 cm:** Significant/Pathological.
*   **Q-Angle:** Increased (predisposes to [[Recurrent Patellar Dislocation]]).

**Malicious Malalignment Syndrome:** Combination of excessive femoral anteversion, external tibial torsion, genu valgum, and increased Q-angle.

#### Treatment
*   **Physiological:** Spontaneous recovery in most idiopathic cases. Reassurance.
*   **Medical:** Treat underlying Rickets (Vitamin D, Calcium).
*   **Surgical:** Indicated if inter-malleolar distance is **>10 cm** or age **>10 years**.
    1.  **Growth Modulation (Hemiepiphysiodesis):** For growing children. Using **8-plates** or staples on the medial side of the distal femur to slow growth medially while lateral side grows, correcting the valgus.
    2.  **Osteotomy:** For skeletal maturity (closed physis).
        *   **Supracondylar Femoral Osteotomy** (MacEwen's): Medial closing wedge or lateral opening wedge.
        *   **High Tibial Osteotomy:** Less common for valgus.

### 4. Genu Varum (Bow Legs)

#### Etiology
1.  **Physiological:** Common in toddlers.
2.  **Metabolic:** [[Rickets]] (Leading cause of pathological varus).
3.  **[[Blount's Disease]] (Tibia Vara):** Pathological growth disturbance of the medial aspect of the proximal tibial physis.
4.  **Skeletal Dysplasia:** [[Achondroplasia]], Metaphyseal dysplasia.
5.  **Degenerative:** [[Osteoarthritis]] of the knee (common in adults).
6.  **Trauma:** Malunited fractures.

#### Clinical Features
*   **Deformity:** Ankles touch, but knees are separated.
*   **In-toeing:** often associated with tibial internal torsion.
*   **Lateral Thrust:** Visible thrust of the knee laterally during the stance phase of gait (suggests ligament laxity or Blount's).

#### Assessment
*   **Inter-condylar Distance:** Distance between femoral condyles when ankles touch.
*   **Radiographs:** Standing AP view (Scanogram).
    *   **Metaphyseal-Diaphyseal Angle (Drennan’s Angle):** Used to differentiate physiological varus from Blount’s disease. Angle **>11-16°** suggests Blount’s.

#### Blount's Disease (Tibia Vara)
*   **Pathology:** Growth retardation of the posteromedial part of the proximal tibial physis.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Infantile:** Bilateral, onset < 3 years.
    *   **Adolescent:** Unilateral, onset > 10 years, associated with obesity.
*   **X-ray:** Beaking of the medial metaphysis of the tibia.

#### Treatment
*   **Physiological:** Observation; usually corrects by age 2-3.
*   **Rickets:** Medical management.
*   **Blount’s/Pathological:**
    *   **Orthosis:** KAFO (Knee-Ankle-Foot Orthosis) – limited success.
    *   **Surgery:**
        *   **Growth Modulation:** Lateral hemiepiphysiodesis (8-plates).
        *   **Corrective Osteotomy:** **High Tibial Osteotomy (HTO)** (Valgus osteotomy) is the standard for severe deformity or adults.
