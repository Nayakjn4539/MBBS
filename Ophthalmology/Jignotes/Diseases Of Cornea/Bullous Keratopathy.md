# [[Diseases Of Cornea]] > Bullous Keratopathy

### Bullous Keratopathy

**Bullous Keratopathy** is a condition characterized by intractable [[corneal edema]], leading to the formation of blisters (bullae) in the [[corneal epithelium]]. It represents the end-stage of endothelial decompensation where the [[corneal endothelium]] fails to maintain the cornea in a dehydrated state,.

### Etiology
The primary cause is endothelial dysfunction. The corneal endothelium normally pumps fluid out of the stroma. When the cell density falls below a critical level (approximately 500 cells/mm²), the pump function fails, leading to edema,.

| Category | Causes |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Surgical Trauma (Most Common)** | **Pseudophakic Bullous Keratopathy (PBK):** Following cataract surgery (especially with anterior chamber IOLs or complicated phacoemulsification),. <br> **Aphakic Bullous Keratopathy (ABK):** In aphakic eyes (no lens). |
| **Endothelial Dystrophies** | **[[Fuchs' Endothelial Dystrophy]]:** Late stages lead to decompensation,. <br> **[[Posterior Polymorphous Dystrophy]]**. |
| **Glaucoma** | **[[Absolute Glaucoma]]:** High IOP drives fluid into the stroma. <br> **Acute Congestive Glaucoma**. |
| **Inflammation** | Chronic [[Uveitis]]. <br> Herpetic keratouveitis (Disciform keratitis). |
| **Trauma** | Mechanical trauma (birth trauma, forceps delivery). <br> Chemical injuries. |

### Pathogenesis
1.  **Endothelial Failure:** Loss of Na+/K+ ATPase pump function due to cell loss or dysfunction,.
2.  **Stromal Edema:** Aqueous humour enters the stroma, causing thickening and haze.
3.  **Epithelial Edema:** Fluid moves anteriorly, accumulating between epithelial cells (intercellular) and within cells (intracellular).
4.  **Bullae Formation:** Large vesicles (bullae) form on the epithelial surface.
5.  **Rupture:** Bullae periodically rupture, exposing corneal nerve endings.

### Clinical Features

#### Symptoms
*   **Pain:** Severe, intermittent pain and foreign body sensation due to the rupture of epithelial bullae exposing sensory nerve endings,.
*   **Visual Impairment:** Significant decrease in vision due to corneal haze and irregular astigmatism.
*   **Halos:** Colored halos around lights due to diffraction by edematous epithelial cells.
*   **Photophobia and Lacrimation:** Associated with epithelial breakdown.

#### Signs
*   **Epithelial Bullae:** Visible vesicles on the corneal surface.
*   **Corneal Haze/Edema:** Loss of transparency.
*   **Increased Corneal Thickness:** Detectable on slit lamp or pachymetry.
*   **Descemet's Folds:** Wrinkling of the [[Descemet's membrane]] due to stromal swelling.
*   **Endothelial Guttata:** "Beaten metal" appearance if associated with Fuchs' dystrophy.
*   **Scarring/Pannus:** In long-standing cases, subepithelial fibrosis (pannus) and vascularization may occur.

### Investigations
1.  **[[Slit Lamp Biomicroscopy]]:** To visualize bullae, stromal thickness, and anterior chamber depth.
2.  **[[Pachymetry]]:** To measure corneal thickness (increased in edema),.
3.  **[[Specular Microscopy]]:** To assess endothelial cell count and morphology (polymegathism and pleomorphism). Useful to predict risk before cataract surgery,.

### Management
Treatment aims to reduce edema for visual improvement and alleviate pain.

#### 1. Medical Management (Symptomatic Relief)
*   **Dehydrating Agents:**
    *   **5% Sodium Chloride (Hypertonic Saline):** Drops or 6% ointment to draw fluid out of the cornea osmotically,.
    *   **Anhydrous Glycerine:** Instilled after topical anesthesia to clear the cornea temporarily for examination.
*   **Warm Air:** Using a hair dryer (at arm's length) to encourage tear evaporation and corneal dehydration,.
*   **IOP Lowering Agents:** Reducing intraocular pressure decreases the hydrostatic force pushing fluid into the stroma.
    *   *Note:* Avoid carbonic anhydrase inhibitors if the endothelium is compromised, as the pump function requires bicarbonate,.
*   **Bandage Contact Lens (BCL):** Hydrophilic soft contact lenses cover exposed nerve endings, providing significant pain relief,,.

#### 2. Surgical Management (Definitive Treatment)
*   **[[Keratoplasty]] (Corneal Transplantation):** The definitive treatment for restoring vision.
    *   **Penetrating Keratoplasty (PK):** Full-thickness replacement. Historically the standard,.
    *   **Endothelial Keratoplasty (EK):** Replaces only the diseased posterior layers. Preferred due to faster recovery and less astigmatism,,.
        *   *DSEK/DSAEK:* Descemet's Stripping (Automated) Endothelial Keratoplasty.
        *   *DMEK:* Descemet's Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty.
*   **Anterior Stromal Puncture:** Multiple shallow punctures to induce scarring and adhesion of epithelium to stroma. Reduces bullae formation and pain but does not improve vision.
*   **Conjunctival Flap (Gundersen Flap):** Thin flap of conjunctiva sutured over the cornea. Used for painful blind eyes or poor surgical candidates.
*   **[[Keratoprosthesis]]:** Artificial cornea used in severe cases with repeated graft failures,.

**Clinical Implications:**
*   Pseudophakic Bullous Keratopathy (PBK) is a leading indication for corneal transplantation worldwide.
*   Careful surgical technique during cataract surgery (using viscoelastics) is crucial to prevent endothelial damage.
