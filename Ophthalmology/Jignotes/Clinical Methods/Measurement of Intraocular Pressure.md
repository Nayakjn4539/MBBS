# Measurement of Intraocular Pressure (Tonometry)

**[[Tonometry]]** is the clinical procedure used to measure the [[intraocular pressure]] (IOP). IOP is the pressure exerted by the intraocular fluids (aqueous humour) on the coats of the eyeball.

### Normal Values and Physiology
*   **Normal IOP Range:** 10–21 mmHg.
*   **Mean IOP:** 16 ± 2.5 mmHg.
*   **Diurnal Variation:** IOP fluctuates throughout the day.
    *   Typically highest in the morning (due to cortisol levels).
    *   Normal variation: < 5 mmHg.
    *   **Clinical Implication:** A fluctuation of > 8 mmHg is suggestive of [[glaucoma]].

### Methods of Tonometry

The methods can be broadly classified into subjective (Digital) and objective (Instrumental) methods.

#### 1. Digital Tonometry
This is a rough, subjective assessment used when instruments are unavailable.
*   **Method:** The patient looks down. The examiner places two index fingers on the upper eyelid above the [[tarsal plate]]. One finger stabilizes while the other gently indents the globe to feel fluctuation.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   **Soft:** Indicates [[hypotony]] (e.g., in [[diabetic ketoacidosis]]).
    *   **Firm:** Normal pressure.
    *   **Hard (Stony Hard):** High pressure (e.g., [[absolute glaucoma]]).

#### 2. Indentation Tonometry (Schiotz Tonometry)
Based on the principle that a plunger will indent a soft eye more than a hard eye.
*   **Instrument:** [[Schiotz tonometer]].
*   **Principle:** Measures the depth of corneal indentation produced by a known weight. The indentation is inversely proportional to the IOP.
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Patient lies supine; cornea is anaesthetized (e.g., [[Proparacaine]] 0.5%).
    2.  Instrument placed vertically on the center of the cornea.
    3.  A weighted plunger (5.5 g initially) indents the cornea.
    4.  The reading on the scale is converted to mmHg using a conversion table (Friedenwald nomogram).
    5.  If the scale reading is < 3, heavier weights (7.5 g, 10 g, or 15 g) are added.
*   **Sources of Error:**
    *   **[[Scleral Rigidity]] (Ocular Rigidity):** The resistance of the coats of the eye to stretching.
        *   **Low Scleral Rigidity:** (e.g., High [[myopia]], Miotics, Cholinesterase inhibitors, retinal detachment surgery). Result: **False Low IOP**.
        *   **High Scleral Rigidity:** (e.g., High [[hypermetropia]], scleral buckling). Result: **False High IOP**.

#### 3. Applanation Tonometry
This is the most accurate method. It is based on the **[[Imbert-Fick law]]**.
*   **Principle:** $P = F/A$
    *   **P** = Pressure inside the sphere.
    *   **F** = Force required to flatten the surface.
    *   **A** = Area flattened.
*   **Concept:** The law states that the pressure inside an ideal sphere is equal to the force necessary to flatten its surface divided by the area of flattening.
    *   *Modification for the human eye:* The cornea is not an ideal sphere (it has tear film capillary attraction and corneal bending resistance). These two forces cancel each other out when the applanation diameter is exactly **3.06 mm**.

**Types of Applanation Tonometry:**

| Type | Examples | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Variable Force** (Fixed Area) | **[[Goldmann Applanation Tonometer]] (GAT)**, Perkins | The force required to flatten a fixed area (3.06 mm) is measured. **This is the Gold Standard.** |
| **Variable Area** (Fixed Force) | Maklakov | The area flattened by a fixed weight is measured (Obsolete). |

### Goldmann Applanation Tonometer (GAT)
This is the **Gold Standard** for IOP measurement.

*   **Components:** Mounted on a [[slit lamp]]. Consists of a double prism (biprism) tip.
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Anaesthetize cornea and stain tear film with **[[fluorescein]]** strip.
    2.  Use **Cobalt Blue filter** on the slit lamp.
    3.  The biprism touches the apex of the cornea.
    4.  The prism splits the view into two semi-circles (mires).
    5.  The force dial is adjusted until the **inner edges** of the two semi-circles just touch each other (forming a sideways 'S' shape).
*   **Calculation:** Dial reading $\times$ 10 = IOP in mmHg.

**Interpretation of Mires:**
*   **Correct Endpoint:** Inner edges of the semi-circles touch.
*   **Too Thick Mires:** Too much fluorescein $\rightarrow$ Overestimation of IOP (False High).
*   **Too Thin Mires:** Too little fluorescein or tear film $\rightarrow$ Underestimation of IOP (False Low).

> Illustration of Goldmann Mires. 1. Correct alignment (inner edges touching). 2. Too much pressure (overlap). 3. Too little pressure (gap between mires)

**Sources of Error in GAT:**
*   **[[Central Corneal Thickness]] (CCT):**
    *   **Thick Cornea:** False **High** IOP (e.g., Corneal edema, scarring).
    *   **Thin Cornea:** False **Low** IOP (e.g., Post-[[LASIK]], PRK, Keratoconus).
    *   *Correction:* 1 mmHg correction roughly for every 10 microns deviation from normal CCT (approx 540-550 microns).
*   **Astigmatism:** If > 3 Diopters, the biprism must be rotated.
*   **Breath holding/Valsalva:** Increases venous pressure $\rightarrow$ False High IOP.

### Other Tonometers

#### 1. Perkins Tonometer
*   A hand-held version of the Goldmann tonometer.
*   **Indication:** Useful for children, bedridden patients, or examinations under anesthesia (EUA).
*   Uses the same biprism and fluorescein principle.

#### 2. Non-Contact Tonometer (NCT) / Air-Puff Tonometer
*   **Mechanism:** Uses a puff of compressed air to flatten the cornea. An optical sensor detects when the cornea is flat.
*   **Advantages:** No contact with the eye (no need for anesthesia, no risk of infection/abrasion).
*   **Disadvantages:** Less accurate than GAT.
*   **Use:** Mass screening and community ophthalmology camps.

#### 3. Mackay-Marg / Tono-Pen
*   **Mechanism:** Electronic applanation.
*   **Indication:** Useful in **irregular or scarred corneas** where GAT mires cannot be visualized properly.

#### 4. Pascal Dynamic Contour Tonometer (DCT)
*   **Mechanism:** Uses a contoured tip that matches the corneal curvature rather than flattening it.
*   **Advantage:** Readings are **independent of central corneal thickness (CCT)**. More accurate in post-LASIK eyes.

#### 5. Rebound Tonometer (Icare)
*   **Mechanism:** A small magnetized probe bounces off the cornea. The deceleration rate correlates with IOP.
*   **Advantage:** No anesthesia required. Useful for **children** and for **self-monitoring** by patients at home.

#### 6. Transpalpebral Tonometer (Diaton)
*   **Mechanism:** Measures IOP through the eyelid (tarsal plate).
*   **Indication:** When corneal contact is contraindicated or not possible.

### Summary Table: Choice of Tonometer

| Clinical Scenario | Preferred Tonometer |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Gold Standard / Routine** | **[[Goldmann Applanation Tonometer]]** |
| **Bedridden / Anesthesia / Children** | [[Perkins tonometer]] |
| **Mass Screening / Camps** | [[Non-contact tonometer]] (Air-puff) |
| **Irregular / Scarred Cornea** | Mackay-Marg or Tono-Pen |
| **Post-Refractive Surgery (LASIK)** | Pascal [[Dynamic Contour Tonometer]] |
| **Self-monitoring / Home use** | [[Rebound tonometer]] (Icare) |

### Clinical Implications of CCT (Pachymetry)
*   **[[Pachymetry]]** is the measurement of corneal thickness.
*   **Normal CCT:** ~540 microns.
*   **Glaucoma Assessment:** CCT is an independent risk factor for glaucoma progression.
    *   A patient with **thin corneas** may have a "normal" GAT reading (e.g., 16 mmHg) but actual pressure might be higher (e.g., 20 mmHg), risking under-diagnosis of glaucoma.
    *   A patient with **thick corneas** may have a "high" GAT reading (e.g., 24 mmHg) but actual pressure is normal, leading to a diagnosis of [[Ocular Hypertension]].
