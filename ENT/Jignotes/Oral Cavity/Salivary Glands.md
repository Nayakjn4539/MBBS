# Salivary Glands

The salivary glands consist of three paired major glands and numerous minor glands dispersed throughout the upper aerodigestive tract. They are exocrine glands responsible for the secretion of saliva.

## I. Embryology and Anatomy

### 1. Major Salivary Glands

| Gland | Type of Secretion | Location & Anatomy | Duct System | Clinical Relation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Parotid Gland]]** | **Purely Serous** (Watery) | • Largest gland.<br>• Inverted pyramidal shape.<br>• Divided into **Superficial** (80%) and **Deep** lobes by the **[[Facial Nerve]]**.<br>• Deep lobe lies in the **[[Parapharyngeal Space]]**. | **Stensen’s Duct**<br>• approx 5 cm long.<br>• Runs on [[Masseter Muscle]], pierces [[Buccinator Muscle]].<br>• Opens in vestibule opposite the **upper 2nd Molar**. | • **Facial Nerve** preservation is critical during surgery.<br>• Mumps usually affects this gland. |
| **[[Submandibular Gland]]** | **Mixed** (Serous & Mucous) | • Located in the submandibular triangle (digastric triangle).<br>• Has a large superficial and small deep lobe continuous around the posterior border of **[[Mylohyoid Muscle]]**. | **Wharton’s Duct**<br>• Runs forward on [[Hyoglossus Muscle]].<br>• Opens in floor of mouth lateral to **[[Lingual Frenulum]]**. | • **Lingual Nerve** loops around the duct (risk of injury).<br>• **Marginal Mandibular Nerve** runs superficial to the gland. |
| **[[Sublingual Gland]]** | **Predominantly Mucous** | • Smallest of major glands.<br>• Almond shaped.<br>• Located in the anterior floor of mouth, superior to mylohyoid. | • **Ducts of Rivinus** (8-20 small ducts opening directly into floor of mouth).<br>• Some drain into Wharton's duct. | • Associated with **[[Ranula]]** formation. |

### 2. Minor Salivary Glands
*   **Number:** 600–1000 glands.
*   **Location:** Dispersed submucosally in the oral cavity, oropharynx, palate, and sinuses.
*   **Significance:**
    *   Highest concentration in the **[[Hard Palate]]**.
    *   Tumors here are **more likely to be malignant** compared to major glands.

### 3. Surgical Landmarks for Facial Nerve (Parotid Surgery)
To safely perform parotidectomy, the facial nerve trunk must be identified. Landmarks include:
*   **Tragal Pointer:** Nerve lies 1 cm inferior and deep to it.
*   **Tympanomastoid Suture:** Nerve lies 6–8 mm deep to this suture line.
*   **Posterior Belly of Digastric:** Nerve runs superior and parallel to it.
*   **Styloid Process:** Nerve lies lateral to it.

## II. Physiology of Saliva

*   **Volume:** Approximately 1500 ml/day.
*   **Flow Rates:** Unstimulated (0.3 ml/min) vs. Stimulated (up to 4 ml/min).
*   **Functions:**
    1.  **Lubrication:** Glycoproteins protect mucous membranes.
    2.  **Digestion:** Salivary amylase for carbohydrates.
    3.  **Oral Hygiene:** Bacteriostatic action (lysozymes), buffering (protects enamel), and mechanical flushing.

> **Clinical Insight:** **[[Xerostomia]]** (dry mouth) causes difficulty in chewing, swallowing, and phonation, and increases risk of dental caries.

## III. Non-Neoplastic Disorders

### 1. Sialolithiasis (Salivary Stones)
Formation of calculi within the ductal system causing obstruction.
*   **Site Predilection:**
    *   **Submandibular Gland (80–90%):** Most common due to antigravity flow, longer/tortuous duct, and alkaline/viscous saliva.
    *   **Parotid Gland (10–20%):** Less common.
*   **Clinical Features:** Recurrent postprandial (after eating) swelling and pain (Salivary Colic).
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   **Palpation:** Bimanual palpation for submandibular stones.
    *   **Imaging:** X-ray (Occlusal view for submandibular; 80% are radio-opaque), Sialography, Ultrasound.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Intraoral removal (if stone is near duct opening).
    *   Gland excision (for deep intraglandular stones).
    *   **[[Sialendoscopy]]** (minimally invasive).

### 2. Infections (Sialadenitis)
*   **Acute Suppurative Sialadenitis:**
    *   Usually **Parotid**.
    *   Organism: *Staphylococcus aureus*.
    *   Risk Factors: Elderly, dehydration, debilitated patients.
*   **Mumps (Viral Parotitis):**
    *   Bilateral painful parotid swelling.
    *   Caused by Paramyxovirus.

### 3. Cysts
*   **[[Mucocele]]:** Retention cyst of minor salivary glands (commonly lower lip) due to duct obstruction.
*   **[[Ranula]]:**
    *   Cystic translucent lesion in the floor of the mouth arising from the **[[Sublingual Gland]]**.
    *   Appearance: "Frog's belly".
    *   **Plunging Ranula:** Extends into the neck through the mylohyoid muscle.
    *   **Treatment:** Marsupialization or excision of the sublingual gland.

### 4. Autoimmune Disorders
*   **[[Sjogren's Syndrome]]:**
    *   **Primary:** Xerostomia + Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (Dry eyes).
    *   **Secondary:** Above symptoms + Connective tissue disorder (e.g., Rheumatoid Arthritis).
    *   **Diagnosis:** SS-A (Ro) and SS-B (La) antibodies; Lower lip biopsy showing lymphocytic infiltration.
    *   **Risk:** Increased risk of **Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma** (MALT type).

### 5. Frey's Syndrome (Gustatory Sweating)
*   **Pathophysiology:** Complication of parotidectomy. Aberrant regeneration of parasympathetic fibers (secretomotor) of the **[[Auriculotemporal Nerve]]** which innervate the sweat glands of the skin instead of the parotid.
*   **Symptoms:** Sweating and flushing over the parotid area while eating.
*   **Diagnosis:** Minor's Starch Iodine Test.
*   **Treatment:** Botulinum toxin injection, Tympanic neurectomy.

## IV. Neoplasms of Salivary Glands

**Rule of Thumb for Malignancy:**
*   The smaller the gland, the higher the chance of malignancy.
    *   **Parotid:** ~80% Benign.
    *   **Submandibular:** ~50-60% Benign.
    *   **Minor Glands:** Mostly Malignant.

### 1. Benign Tumors
*   **[[Pleomorphic Adenoma]] (Benign Mixed Tumor):**
    *   **Most common** tumor of all salivary glands (mostly Parotid).
    *   **Pathology:** Mixed epithelial and mesenchymal elements (chondroid/myxoid stroma).
    *   **Clinical:** Slow-growing, painless mass.
    *   **Treatment:** Superficial parotidectomy (Enucleation is contraindicated due to recurrence).
    *   **Risk:** Can transform into Carcinoma ex-pleomorphic adenoma if longstanding.
*   **[[Warthin's Tumor]] (Papillary Cystadenoma Lymphomatosum):**
    *   Second most common benign tumor.
    *   Occurs in **Tail of Parotid**.
    *   Common in **Elderly Males** and **Smokers**.
    *   "Hot nodule" on Technetium-99m scan.

### 2. Malignant Tumors
*   **[[Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma]]:**
    *   **Most common malignancy** of the Parotid gland.
    *   Types: Low grade (good prognosis) vs. High grade (poor prognosis).
*   **[[Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma]] (Cylindroma):**
    *   Most common malignancy of Submandibular and Minor glands.
    *   **Histology:** Cribriform or "Swiss cheese" pattern.
    *   **Feature:** **Perineural invasion** (spreads along nerves), causing pain.
*   **[[Acinic Cell Carcinoma]]:**
    *   Low-grade malignancy arising from acinar cells.

## V. Diagnostic Evaluation

### History and Examination
*   **Pain:** Suggests inflammation, stones, or malignancy (perineural invasion).
*   **Facial Palsy:** Highly suggestive of malignancy in parotid masses.
*   **Fixity:** Fixity to skin or deep structures indicates malignancy.
*   **Bimanual Palpation:** Essential for submandibular gland and duct stones.

### Investigations
1.  **Imaging:**
    *   **CT/MRI:** For deep lobe tumors, extent of disease, and malignancy.
    *   **Ultrasound:** Distinguishes cystic vs. solid masses; detects radiolucent stones.
    *   **Sialography:** Contrast study of ductal system. Used for sialectasis and stones. Contraindicated in acute infection.
2.  **FNAC (Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology):**
    *   Standard diagnostic tool for masses. Differentiates benign vs. malignant with high accuracy (~91%).
    *   Open biopsy is generally **contraindicated** for parotid masses (risk of fistula and tumor spillage) unless done as part of excision.
