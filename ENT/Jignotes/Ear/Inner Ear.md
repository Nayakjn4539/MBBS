# [[Ear]] > Inner Ear

### **Anatomy of the Inner Ear (Labyrinth)**

The **Inner Ear**, also known as the [[Labyrinth]], is located within the petrous part of the [[Temporal Bone]]. It is the essential organ for both hearing (cochlea) and balance (vestibular system). It consists of two main divisions: the **Bony Labyrinth** and the **Membranous Labyrinth**.

### **1. Embryology**
*   **Origin:**
    *   **Membranous Labyrinth:** Develops from the **Otic Placode** (surface ectoderm) overlying the hindbrain. This invaginates to form the otic pit and then the otic vesicle (otocyst).
    *   **Bony Labyrinth:** Develops from the mesenchyme surrounding the otocyst (mesoderm) via endochondral ossification,.
*   **Timeline:**
    *   Starts in the **3rd week** of intrauterine life.
    *   Inner ear is fully developed by **birth** (adult size).
    *   **Pars Superior** (Utricle, Semicircular canals) develops earlier than **Pars Inferior** (Saccule, Cochlea).

### **2. Bony Labyrinth (Otic Capsule)**
The bony labyrinth is a series of cavities within the petrous temporal bone, filled with **perilymph**. It consists of three parts:

#### **A. Vestibule**
*   **Location:** Central chamber, lateral to the [[Internal Auditory Canal]] (IAC) and medial to the middle ear.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Lateral Wall:** Contains the **Oval Window** ([[Fenestra Vestibuli]]), which is closed by the stapes footplate.
    *   **Medial Wall:** Contains two distinct depressions:
        *   **Spherical Recess:** Lodges the [[Saccule]].
        *   **Elliptical Recess:** Lodges the [[Utricle]].
    *   **Vestibular Aqueduct:** Extends from the medial wall to the posterior surface of the petrous bone; transmits the endolymphatic duct.

#### **B. Semicircular Canals (SCC)**
There are three bony canals situated posterosuperior to the vestibule, arranged at right angles to each other.
1.  **Superior (Anterior) SCC:** Transverse to the petrous ridge; produces the **arcuate eminence** on the anterior surface of the petrous bone.
2.  **Posterior SCC:** Parallel to the posterior surface of the petrous bone.
3.  **Lateral (Horizontal) SCC:** Lies at a 30° angle to the horizontal plane.
*   **Crux:** The three canals open into the vestibule via **5 openings** (not 6) because the Superior and Posterior canals fuse to form the **Crus Commune**.

#### **C. Bony Cochlea**
*   **Shape:** Resembles a snail shell; a coiled tube making **2.5 to 2.75 turns** around a central bony axis called the [[Modiolus]],.
*   **Compartments:** The bony cochlea is divided by the osseous spiral lamina and basilar membrane into:
    *   **Scala Vestibuli:** Upper compartment (connects to Oval Window).
    *   **Scala Tympani:** Lower compartment (connects to Round Window).
*   **Connections:**
    *   **Helicotrema:** The apex where Scala Vestibuli and Scala Tympani communicate.
    *   **Cochlear Aqueduct:** Connects the Scala Tympani to the subarachnoid space (allows CSF-perilymph communication).

### **3. Membranous Labyrinth**
This is a continuous series of communicating sacs and ducts suspended **within** the bony labyrinth. It is filled with **endolymph** and contains the sensory end-organs.

| Part of Membranous Labyrinth | Corresponding Bony Part | Sensory End Organ | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Cochlear Duct]]** (Scala Media) | Cochlea | **[[Organ of Corti]]** | Hearing |
| **[[Utricle]]** | Vestibule (Elliptical Recess) | **Macula** | Linear acceleration / Gravity |
| **[[Saccule]]** | Vestibule (Spherical Recess) | **Macula** | Linear acceleration / Gravity |
| **[[Semicircular Ducts]]** | Semicircular Canals | **Crista Ampullaris** | Angular/Rotational acceleration |

*   **Endolymphatic Duct & Sac:** Formed by the union of ducts from the utricle and saccule. The sac lies between layers of the dura mater and absorbs endolymph.
*   **Ductus Reuniens:** Connects the saccule to the cochlear duct.

### **4. Inner Ear Fluids**

The physiology of the inner ear relies on unique fluid environments.

| Feature | **[[Perilymph]]** | **[[Endolymph]]** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Location** | Between bony and membranous labyrinth (Scala Vestibuli, Scala Tympani) | Inside membranous labyrinth (Scala Media, Utricle, Saccule, SCC) |
| **Composition** | High **Na+** (140 mEq/L), Low K+ (Like ECF/CSF) | High **K+** (144 mEq/L), Low Na+ (Like ICF) |
| **Origin** | Ultrafiltrate of blood or CSF via cochlear aqueduct | Secreted by **[[Stria Vascularis]]** (cochlea) and Dark Cells (vestibule) |
| **Drainage** | Cochlear aqueduct -> Subarachnoid space | **Endolymphatic Sac** |
| **Electrical Potential**| 0 mV | **+80 mV** (Endocochlear potential) |

*   **Cortilymph:** Fluid found inside the Tunnel of Corti; composition similar to perilymph (High Na+).

### **5. Sensory Physiology & Microanatomy**

#### **A. Auditory System: [[Organ of Corti]]**
Located on the **Basilar Membrane** within the Scala Media.
*   **Hair Cells:**
    *   **Inner Hair Cells (IHC):** Single row, flask-shaped. Primary afferent input (95% of nerve fibers). Responsible for sound transmission.
    *   **Outer Hair Cells (OHC):** 3-4 rows, cylindrical. Efferent innervation. Responsible for **cochlear amplification** and fine-tuning. They produce **[[Otoacoustic Emissions]] (OAEs)**,.
*   **Tectorial Membrane:** Gelatinous structure overlying hair cells. Shearing force between hair cells and this membrane triggers depolarization.
*   **Stria Vascularis:** Lateral wall of Scala Media; maintains the ionic composition (battery of the cochlea).

**Physiology of Hearing (Traveling Wave Theory):**
*   **Basal Turn:** Narrow and stiff basilar membrane $\rightarrow$ Detects **High Frequencies**.
*   **Apical Turn:** Wide and flaccid basilar membrane $\rightarrow$ Detects **Low Frequencies**.

#### **B. Vestibular System: Balance**
*   **Cristae Ampullaris:** Located in the ampulla of SCCs. Contains hair cells embedded in a gelatinous **Cupula**. Senses **angular/rotational acceleration**.
*   **Maculae:** Located in Utricle and Saccule. Contains hair cells with cilia embedded in an **Otolithic membrane** (containing Calcium Carbonate crystals/otoconia). Senses **Linear acceleration** and **Gravity**.

### **6. Neurovascular Supply**

#### **Arterial Supply**
*   **[[Labyrinthine Artery]]**: Usually a branch of the **Anterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (AICA)** (85%) or Basilar Artery,.
*   It is an **end-artery**; no collateral circulation (implication: occlusion leads to sudden hearing loss/vertigo).

#### **Innervation**
*   **[[Vestibulocochlear Nerve]] (CN VIII):**
    *   **Cochlear Nerve:** Supplies Organ of Corti.
    *   **Superior Vestibular Nerve:** Supplies Utricle, Superior SCC, Lateral SCC.
    *   **Inferior Vestibular Nerve:** Supplies Saccule, Posterior SCC (via Singular nerve).

---

### **7. Clinical Implications**

*   **[[Ménière’s Disease]] (Endolymphatic Hydrops):** Distension of the endolymphatic system (Scala Media and Saccule). Rupture of **Reissner's membrane** mixes high K+ fluid with perilymph, causing vertigo and fluctuating SNHL (low frequency first),.
*   **[[Labyrinthitis]]:**
    *   **Serous:** Sterile inflammation (toxins) -> Reversible loss.
    *   **Suppurative:** Bacterial invasion -> Permanent loss and ossification (**Labyrinthitis Ossificans**).
*   **[[Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo]] (BPPV):** Dislodged otoconia from the Utricle float into the Semicircular canals (commonly Posterior SCC), causing brief vertigo on head movement.
*   **[[Ototoxicity]]:** Drugs like Aminoglycosides and Cisplatin damage Outer Hair Cells (High frequency loss first). Loop diuretics affect the Stria Vascularis.
*   **[[Acoustic Neuroma]] (Vestibular Schwannoma):** Usually arises from the Inferior Vestibular Nerve in the internal auditory canal.
*   **Superior Canal Dehiscence:** "Third window" effect. Sound/pressure triggers vertigo ([[Tullio Phenomenon]]).

### **Mnemonics**
*   **SLIM:** Auditory Pathway: **S**uperior Olive $\rightarrow$ **L**ateral Lemniscus $\rightarrow$ **I**nferior Colliculus $\rightarrow$ **M**edial Geniculate Body.
*   **SCALP:** Layers of Scalp (often relevant in ear surgery approaches): **S**kin, **C**onnective tissue, **A**poneurosis, **L**oose areolar tissue, **P**ericranium.
*   **3-4-5:** The **3** Semicircular canals open into the Utricle via **5** openings.
