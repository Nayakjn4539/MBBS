### The Best Graph for Two Variables: [[Scatter Diagram]]

The best graph to depict the relationship (correlation) between two quantitative (continuous) variables is the **[[Scatter Diagram]]**, also known as a **Dot Diagram** or **Correlation Diagram**.

It is a graphical presentation where varying frequencies of two characters are cross-classified.

#### **How to Construct**
*   **Axes:**
    *   **X-axis (Abscissa):** Represents the **Independent** variable (the cause).
    *   **Y-axis (Ordinate):** Represents the **Dependent** or outcome variable (the effect),.
*   **Plotting:** Perpendiculars drawn from the X and Y readings meet to form a single **point or dot**. The collection of these dots shows the "scatter" or trend.

#### **Types of Relationships Illustrated with Examples**

The pattern of the dots indicates the nature and strength of the correlation between the variables:

**1. Positive Correlation**
*   **Trend:** The dots cluster around an imaginary line rising from the **lower left to the upper right**.
*   **Interpretation:** As one variable increases, the other also increases.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Height and Weight:** Taller people tend to be heavier.
    *   **Temperature and Pulse Rate:** Pulse rate typically rises with body temperature.
    *   **Fat intake and Sugar intake:** Populations with higher income often consume more of both.

**2. Negative Correlation**
*   **Trend:** The dots cluster around an imaginary line falling from the **upper left to the lower right**.
*   **Interpretation:** As one variable increases, the other decreases (inverse relationship).
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Age and Vital Capacity:** As age increases in adults, vital capacity often decreases.
    *   **Income and Infant Mortality Rate (IMR):** Higher socioeconomic status is associated with lower IMR.
    *   **Price and Demand:** Often, as price rises, demand falls.

**3. No Correlation (Zero Correlation)**
*   **Trend:** The dots are scattered randomly with no definable pattern or imaginary line.
*   **Interpretation:** The two variables are completely independent of each other; a change in one does not affect the other.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Height and Pulse Rate:** A person's height has no bearing on their pulse rate.
    *   **Intelligence and Shoe Size.**

**4. Perfect Correlation**
*   **Trend:** All dots lie exactly on a straight line.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   **Perfect Positive ($r = +1$):** Variables rise in exact proportion.
    *   **Perfect Negative ($r = -1$):** One rises and the other falls in exact proportion.
*   **Note:** This is rarely seen in biological sciences but may occur in physical sciences (e.g., Pressure and Volume of a gas).

#### **Clinical Relevance**
*   **Correlation Coefficient ($r$):** The scatter diagram visually represents the correlation coefficient, which ranges from **-1 to +1**.
    *   **$r$ near +1:** Strong positive association.
    *   **$r$ near -1:** Strong negative association.
    *   **$r$ near 0:** No association.
*   **Regression:** If a relationship exists, a **[[Regression Line]]** (line of best fit) can be drawn through the scatter points to predict the value of one variable based on the other.
*   **Caution:** Correlation does not necessarily imply causation. A scatter diagram shows association, but further epidemiological studies are needed to prove cause and effect.
