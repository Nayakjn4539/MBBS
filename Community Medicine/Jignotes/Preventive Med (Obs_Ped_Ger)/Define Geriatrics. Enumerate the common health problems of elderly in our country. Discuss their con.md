# [[PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IN OBSTETRICS, PAEDIATRICS AND GERIATRICS]] > Define Geriatrics. Enumerate the common health problems of elderly in our country. Discuss their control and preventive measures.

### Definition

**[[Geriatrics]]** (Clinical Gerontology) is defined as the branch of medicine dealing with the clinical, preventive, remedial, and social aspects of illness in the elderly.
*   **Gerontology** is the scientific study of the physical and psychological changes which are incident to old age.

> **Note:** Sir James Sterling Ross stated the principle of preventive medicine in geriatrics as: *"You do not heal old age. You protect it; you promote it; you extend it."*

### Common Health Problems of the Elderly

The health problems of the aged can be broadly classified into three categories based on the nature of the condition:

#### 1. Problems Due to the Ageing Process (Physiological)
These are disabilities incident to the biological process of [[senescence]].
*   **Sensory Impairment:** [[Senile Cataract]], [[Glaucoma]], and Nerve deafness (Presbycusis).
*   **Locomotor:** [[Osteoporosis]] affecting mobility.
*   **Respiratory:** Emphysema (loss of lung elasticity).
*   **Neurological:** Failure of special senses and changes in mental outlook.

#### 2. Problems Associated with Long-term Illness (Pathological)
These are chronic diseases more frequent among older people.
*   **Cardiovascular:** [[Atherosclerosis]], [[Hypertension]], and Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD).
*   **Locomotor System:** Fibrositis, Gout, [[Osteoarthritis]], Rheumatoid arthritis, and Spondylitis. These cause maximum discomfort and disability.
*   **Respiratory:** Chronic bronchitis and Asthma.
*   **Genitourinary:** Enlargement of the prostate ([[BPH]]), dysuria, frequency, and urgency of micturition.
*   **Metabolic/Endocrine:** [[Diabetes Mellitus]] (approx. 75% of diabetics are over 50 years of age).
*   **Accidents:** Falls leading to fractures (commonly fracture neck of femur) due to brittle bones and slow reflexes.
*   **Neoplasms:** Cancer of the prostate and other malignancies.

#### 3. Psychological and Social Problems
*   **Mental Changes:** Impaired memory, rigidity of outlook, and dislike of change.
*   **Sexual Adjustment:** Physical and emotional disturbances during menopause in women and diminished sexual activity in men.
*   **Emotional Disorders:** Depression, social maladjustment, bitterness, and inner withdrawal due to loneliness and loss of status.
*   **Social Problems:** Poverty, loss of income, dependency, and social isolation (Empty Nest Syndrome).

**Mnemonic for Geriatric Problems: "D-E-G-E-N-E-R-A-T-E"**
*   **D**iabetes/Dementia
*   **E**ye problems (Cataract)
*   **G**enitourinary (Prostate)
*   **E**ars (Deafness)
*   **N**utritional (Anemia)
*   **E**motional (Depression)
*   **R**espiratory (Bronchitis)
*   **A**rthritis/Accidents
*   **T**ension (Hypertension)
*   **E**lderly Heart Disease (IHD)

### Control and Preventive Measures

The strategy for geriatric care involves "Healthy Ageing" using the levels of prevention.

#### 1. Primary Prevention
Aims to prevent the onset of disease by modifying risk factors.
*   **Diet and Nutrition:**
    *   Balanced diet to prevent malnutrition and obesity.
    *   Reduction of **saturated fats** and **salt** (<5g/day) to control [[Hypertension]] and CVD.
    *   Adequate calcium and Vitamin D to prevent [[Osteoporosis]].
*   **Physical Activity:** Regular moderate exercise to maintain mobility, control weight, and improve bone density.
*   **Lifestyle Modifications:**
    *   Cessation of smoking (reduces risk of respiratory and cardiac diseases).
    *   Limiting alcohol intake.
*   **Injury Prevention:** Measures to prevent falls at home (e.g., adequate lighting, non-slip floors).
*   **Immunization:** Vaccination against [[Influenza]], Pneumococcal pneumonia, and Tetanus.

#### 2. Secondary Prevention
Aims at early diagnosis and treatment to prevent progression.
*   **Periodic Health Check-ups:** Routine screening for:
    *   Blood pressure (Hypertension).
    *   Blood sugar (Diabetes).
    *   Intraocular pressure (Glaucoma) and Vision (Cataract).
    *   Cancer screening (e.g., Prostate-specific antigen, Pap smear, Mammography).
*   **Opportunistic Screening:** utilizing every contact with the health system to detect hidden diseases (The Iceberg Phenomenon).

#### 3. Tertiary Prevention
Aims to limit disability and promote rehabilitation.
*   **Disability Limitation:** Intensive treatment of established diseases (e.g., strict sugar control in diabetes to prevent retinopathy).
*   **Rehabilitation:**
    *   **Medical:** Cataract surgery, joint replacement.
    *   **Physical:** Physiotherapy, use of walking aids, hearing aids, and dentures.
    *   **Social:** Encouraging social interaction to combat isolation.

#### 4. Social Welfare Measures
*   **[[National Policy on Older Persons]] (1999):** Identifies areas of intervention like financial security, healthcare, and shelter.
*   **[[National Programme for Health Care of the Elderly]] (NPHCE):** Provides separate, specialized, and comprehensive healthcare to senior citizens at various levels (PHC, CHC, District Hospital).
*   **Social Security:** Old age pensions (e.g., Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme), travel concessions, and tax relief.
*   **Old Age Homes:** Establishing day-care centers and homes for the destitute elderly.

### Clinical Relevance
**Polypharmacy:** Elderly patients often suffer from multiple co-morbidities leading to the prescription of multiple drugs. This increases the risk of adverse drug reactions and interactions. Physicians must practice rational prescribing in geriatrics.
