# [[Health Care Of The Community]] > Levels of Health Care

Health services are generally organized into three distinct levels based on the complexity of care provided and the infrastructure available. Each level is supported by a higher level to which patients are referred for more specialized management.

### 1. Primary Health Care (Primary Level)

*   **Definition:** This is the **first level of contact** between the individual/family/community and the national health system. It provides [[Essential Health Care]].
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   It brings health care **as close as possible** to where people live and work.
    *   It is the most effective level for dealing with the majority of prevailing health problems within the context of the community's needs.
    *   It uses **appropriate technology** and methods that are scientifically sound and socially acceptable.
*   **Infrastructure/Providers in India:**
    *   [[Sub-centres]] (SCs).
    *   [[Primary Health Centres]] (PHCs).
    *   **Grass-root level workers:** [[ASHA]] (Accredited Social Health Activist), [[Anganwadi Worker]], Village Health Guides, and Trained Dais.
    *   **Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs):** Upgraded Sub-centres and PHCs providing Comprehensive Primary Health Care.

> **Clinical Relevance:** A patient with fever, minor injuries, diarrhea, or requiring immunization/antenatal check-ups visits this level. Most health needs are resolved here.

### 2. Secondary Health Care (Intermediate Level)

*   **Definition:** This is the **intermediate level** of health care where more complex problems are dealt with.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   It serves as the **[[First Referral Level]]** (FRU) in the health system.
    *   It provides essentially curative services and basic specialist facilities.
    *   It deals with cases referred from the Primary Level.
*   **Infrastructure/Providers in India:**
    *   [[Community Health Centres]] (CHCs).
    *   [[District Hospitals]].
    *   **Sub-district Hospitals** (Taluk Hospitals).

> **Clinical Relevance:** A patient requiring a C-section, hernia repair, or management of severe pneumonia who cannot be managed at a PHC is referred here.

### 3. Tertiary Health Care (Central/Regional Level)

*   **Definition:** This is the **highest level** of care offering super-specialist services.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   It requires highly specialized equipment, facilities, and expertise.
    *   It serves as the **Second Referral Level**.
    *   Besides patient care, these institutions provide **planning, managerial skills, and teaching/training** for specialized staff.
*   **Infrastructure/Providers in India:**
    *   [[Medical Colleges]] and Hospitals.
    *   Regional Hospitals.
    *   All India Institutes (e.g., AIIMS).
    *   Specialized Hospitals (e.g., Cancer Institutes).

> **Clinical Relevance:** A patient requiring cardiac bypass surgery, neurosurgery, or advanced cancer treatment is referred to this level.

### Comparative Overview of Levels of Health Care

| Feature | Primary Level | Secondary Level | Tertiary Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Contact Point** | First level of contact | First Referral Level | Second Referral Level/Apex |
| **Complexity** | Basic/Essential care | Intermediate/Complex care | Super-specialized/Highly Complex |
| **Institutions** | [[Sub-centres]], [[PHC]] | [[CHC]], District Hospitals | [[Medical Colleges]], Regional Institutes |
| **Focus** | Preventive, Promotive, Basic Curative | Curative, Basic Specialist care | Specialized Curative, Teaching, Research |
| **Coverage** | Small population (Village level) | Block/District level | Regional/National level |

### The Referral System

A fundamental function of the health care system is a sound **[[Referral System]]**.
*   It ensures continuity of care.
*   It must be a **two-way exchange**:
    1.  **Referral:** Sending patients to a higher level for specialized care.
    2.  **Counter-Referral/Feedback:** Returning patients to the original centre with information for follow-up care.
