# [[HEALTH PLANNING & MANAGEMENT]] > Cost effective and cost benefit analysis in health care

### **Economic Analysis in Health Management**

In health planning, resources (money, manpower, material) are always limited while health needs are infinite. Management techniques are used to ensure the best use of these scarce resources. Two major quantitative techniques are **Cost-Benefit Analysis** and **Cost-Effective Analysis**.

---

### **1. Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)**

This is a management technique where the economic benefits of any programme are compared with the cost of that programme.

*   **Core Concept:** Both the **Input** (Cost) and the **Output** (Benefit) are expressed in **Monetary Terms** (e.g., Rupees or Dollars),.
*   **Objective:** To determine if a specific programme is economically sound and to select the best option among several alternatives based on financial return,.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   Costs are calculated (Capital + Recurring).
    *   Benefits are monetized (e.g., money saved by preventing disease, wages gained by avoiding disability).
    *   **Approaches used:**
        *   *Human Capital Approach*
        *   *Willingness to Pay Approach*.
*   **Evaluation:** The results are expressed as a **Cost-Benefit Ratio** (Total monetary benefit divided by Total monetary cost).
*   **Limitation:** The major drawback is that the benefits in the health field (e.g., relief from pain, saving a life) cannot always be ethically or accurately converted into money. It is difficult to put a price tag on human life,.

### **2. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)**

This is a more promising and widely used tool in the health sector than CBA. It aids decision-making by considering the "outputs" of competing interventions in relation to the resources they consume.

*   **Core Concept:** The **Input** is expressed in Monetary Terms, but the **Output** (Effectiveness) is expressed in **Natural Units** or health results (e.g., number of lives saved, number of days free from disease, cases cured),.
*   **Objective:** To determine which alternative achieves the most health benefit for a given cost, or achieves a specific health goal at the minimum cost.
*   **Measurement:**
    *   **Cost-Effectiveness Ratio:** Cost of alternative / Effectiveness of alternative.
    *   It is often expressed as cost per [[Quality Adjusted Life Years]] (QALYs) or [[Disability Adjusted Life Years]] (DALY) gained.
*   **Application:** It is used to compare different strategies for the same goal (e.g., comparing Kidney Transplant vs. Dialysis for renal failure).

> **Note:** [[Cost Utility Analysis]] (CUA) is a specific type of CEA where the outcome is adjusted for quality of life (using QALYs). It allows comparison across diverse interventions,.

### **Comparison: CBA vs. CEA**

| Feature | Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) | Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unit of Outcome** | **Monetary terms** (Money) | **Natural units** (Lives saved, cases cured) |
| **Focus** | Net financial gain/welfare gain | Achieving a specific health target efficiently |
| **Ethical Issues** | High (Pricing human life is controversial) | Low (Focuses on health outcomes) |
| **Usage in Health** | Limited use (Hard to calculate) | **Most preferred** and widely used |
| **Output Measure** | Cost-Benefit Ratio | Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (e.g., $ per DALY) |
| **Example** | Money saved by malaria control vs. Cost of DDT spray | Cost per TB case cured by DOTS vs. Non-DOTS |

### **Clinical Relevance & Examples**

1.  **Tuberculosis Control:**
    *   A study compared **DOTS** (Directly Observed Treatment Short-course) vs. Conventional treatment.
    *   DOTS was found to be **2.4 to 4.2 times more cost-effective** (cheaper per cure achieved) compared to conventional treatment. This CEA justified the universal adoption of [[RNTCP]]/NTEP.

2.  **Child Survival:**
    *   Comparing Immunization (Prevention) vs. Curative care.
    *   If Strategy A (Immunization) costs Rs. 25,000 and saves 100 lives (Rs. 250/life) and Strategy B (Curative) costs Rs. 25,000 and saves 15 lives (Rs. 1667/life), **Strategy A is more Cost-Effective**.

---

### **Mnemonic**

To remember the difference between **Benefit** and **Effectiveness**:

*   **B**enefit = **B**ucks (Money/Currency).
*   **E**ffectiveness = **E**vents (Health events like lives saved, cases prevented).
