# [[Environment And Health]] > Medical Entomology Mosquitoes

### Medical Entomology: Mosquitoes

Mosquitoes (Family: [[Culicidae]], Order: Diptera) are the most important insect vectors of human diseases. They constitute a major public health problem globally and in India.

---

### I. General Characteristics & Life Cycle
Mosquitoes undergo **complete metamorphosis**.
1.  **Egg:** Laid on water surface.
2.  **Larva:** Aquatic, free-swimming (wrigglers). Passes through 4 stages (instars).
3.  **Pupa:** Aquatic, comma-shaped (tumblers). Resting stage (non-feeding).
4.  **Adult:** Terrestrial/Aerial. Only females bite (hematophagous) for ovulation; males feed on plant juices.

**Gonotrophic Cycle:** The period from a blood meal to laying eggs (approx. 48 hours in tropics).

### II. Differentiation of Major Mosquito Genera

| Feature | **Anopheles** | **Culex** | **Aedes** | **Mansonia** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Eggs** | Laid **singly**; **Boat shaped** with lateral floats. | Laid in **rafts** (clusters); **Oval** shaped; no floats. | Laid **singly**; **Cigar** shaped; no floats. | Laid in **star-shaped clusters** attached to aquatic plants. |
| **Larva** | **No siphon tube**; floats **parallel** to water surface. | **Long, narrow siphon**; hangs at an **angle** to surface. | **Short, barrel** siphon; hangs at an **angle**. | **Pointed** siphon; attached to rootlets of aquatic plants. |
| **Pupa** | Respiratory trumpet is broad and short. | Respiratory trumpet is long and narrow. | Respiratory trumpet is broad and short. | Trumpets modified to pierce plant roots. |
| **Adult Resting** | Rests at an **angle** (45°) to surface (Head, thorax, abdomen in straight line). | Rests **parallel** to surface (Hunch-backed appearance). | Rests **parallel** to surface. | Rests parallel; wings have **speckled** appearance. |
| **Wings** | **Spotted** wings. | **Clear** wings (unspotted). | Clear wings; Body has **white stripes** ([[Tiger Mosquito]]). | **Speckled** wings and legs (dark/light scales). |
| **Breeding Water** | **Clean** water. | **Dirty/Polluted** water. | **Artificial collections** (clean water). | Water with aquatic vegetation ([[Pistia plant]]). |
| **Flight Range** | 1–3 km. | Up to **11 km** (Strong flier). | **< 100 meters**. | Medium range. |

### III. Specific Genera and Diseases

#### 1. Anopheles
*   **Significance:** Primary vector for [[Malaria]].
*   **Important Species in India:**
    *   *An. culicifacies:* Main vector of **Rural Malaria**.
    *   *An. stephensi:* Main vector of **Urban Malaria** (Breeds in overhead tanks, wells).
    *   *An. fluviatilis:* Hill/Foothill malaria vector.
*   **Diseases Transmitted:**
    *   [[Malaria]] (Definitive host).
    *   [[Lymphatic Filariasis]] (rarely, *W. bancrofti*).
    *   Timori filariasis (*Brugia timori* - not in India).

> **Mnemonic:** **A**nopheles **C**ulicifacies = **C**ountryside (Rural); **A**nopheles **S**tephensi = **S**ity (City/Urban).

#### 2. Culex
*   **Significance:** The "Nuisance Mosquito."
*   **Important Species:**
    *   *Culex quinquefasciatus* (formerly *C. fatigans*): Domestic pest, breeds in sewage/drains.
    *   *Culex tritaeniorhynchus*: Rice-field breeder.
    *   *Culex vishnui*: Rice-field breeder.
*   **Diseases Transmitted:**
    *   [[Bancroftian Filariasis]] (*C. quinquefasciatus*).
    *   [[Japanese Encephalitis]] (*C. tritaeniorhynchus, C. vishnui*).
    *   West Nile Fever.

#### 3. Aedes (Stegomyia)
*   **Significance:** The [[Tiger Mosquito]] (due to white stripes on black body).
*   **Important Species:** *Aedes aegypti*, *Aedes albopictus*.
*   **Habits:**
    *   **Day biter:** Bites chiefly during the day.
    *   **Discordant feeder:** Takes multiple blood meals (spreads disease rapidly).
    *   **Peri-domestic:** Breeds in artificial containers (flower pots, tyres, coolers, broken bottles).
*   **Diseases Transmitted:**
    *   [[Dengue]] / DHF.
    *   [[Chikungunya]].
    *   [[Yellow Fever]] (Not in India).
    *   [[Zika Virus]].
    *   Rift Valley Fever.
*   **Surveillance Indices:** House Index, Container Index, [[Breteau Index]] (should be <1% to prevent Yellow Fever transmission).

> **Mnemonic:** **Aedes** causes **DYCZ** (Dice) = **D**engue, **Y**ellow fever, **C**hikungunya, **Z**ika.

#### 4. Mansonia
*   **Significance:** Big, black/brown mosquito.
*   **Habits:** Breeds in ponds with aquatic plants like *Pistia stratiotes* and *Eichhornia* (Water hyacinth). Larvae obtain oxygen from plant roots.
*   **Diseases Transmitted:**
    *   [[Brugian Filariasis]] (Malayan filariasis) caused by *Brugia malayi*.
    *   Chikungunya (rarely).

### IV. Mosquito Control Measures

**A. Anti-Larval Measures (Source Reduction)**
1.  **Environmental Control:**
    *   Filling and drainage of breeding places.
    *   Intermittent irrigation.
    *   **Urban:** Covering overhead tanks (*An. stephensi*), removal of artificial containers (*Aedes*).
    *   **Mansonia:** Herbicidal removal of *Pistia* plants.
2.  **Chemical Control (Larvicides):**
    *   **Mineral Oils (MLO):** Suffocates larvae (creates film on water). Application: Once a week.
    *   **Paris Green:** Stomach poison (specifically for *Anopheles* surface feeders).
    *   **Synthetic Insecticides:**
        *   [[Temephos]] (Abate): Safe for potable water; used in guinea worm and *Aedes* control.
        *   Fenthion/Chlorpyrifos: For polluted water (*Culex*).
3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Fish: *Gambusia affinis*, *Poecilia reticulata* (Guppy).
    *   Bacteria: *Bacillus thuringiensis* var. *israelensis* (Bti).

**B. Anti-Adult Measures**
1.  **Residual Sprays:**
    *   Spraying indoor surfaces where mosquitoes rest.
    *   Agents: [[DDT]] (1-2 g/m²), Malathion, Synthetic Pyrethroids (Deltamethrin).
2.  **Space Sprays:**
    *   Knock-down effect (immediate kill, no residual action).
    *   Agents: [[Pyrethrum]] extract (nerve poison), Malathion (ULV fogging).
    *   Used during epidemics (e.g., Dengue/JE) to rapidly reduce vector density.
3.  **Genetic Control:**
    *   Sterile male technique, cytoplasmic incompatibility.

**C. Personal Protection**
*   **Mosquito Nets:**
    *   Hole size should be < 0.0475 inch.
    *   [[Insecticide Treated Bed Nets]] (ITBN) / Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) using Permethrin/Deltamethrin.
*   **Screening:** Of houses/buildings.
*   **Repellents:** DEET (Diethyl toluamide), Diethyl phthalate.

### V. Integrated Vector Management (IVM)
A rational decision-making process for the optimal use of resources for vector control. It avoids excessive use of insecticides and combines environmental, biological, and chemical methods.
