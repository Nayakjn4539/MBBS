# [[Neurotoxic Poisons (Peripheral)]] > Curare and Conium

### **NEUROTOXIC POISONS: PERIPHERAL**

These poisons act primarily on the neuromuscular junction or the peripheral nerves, causing paralysis without affecting the central nervous system (consciousness is usually retained).

---

### **1. CURARE**

**Source:**
It is a resinous extract obtained from the bark/stems of various plants, primarily **[[Strychnos toxifera]]** and *Chondrodendron tomentosum*,.

**Active Principle:**
The active alkaloid is **[[Curarine]]**.

**Mode of Action:**
*   It acts on the motor end plate of the muscles.
*   It competitively blocks **[[Acetylcholine]]** (ACh) at the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction.
*   It causes flaccid muscle paralysis but has **no effect** on the central nervous system or sensory nerves.

**Signs and Symptoms:**
The symptoms appear rapidly if injected (it is harmless if swallowed because it is not absorbed from the GIT unless there is a raw surface).
1.  **Muscle Weakness:** Starts in the face and neck, followed by limbs.
2.  **Paralysis:** Complete flaccid paralysis occurs.
3.  **Ptosis:** Drooping of eyelids, difficulty in speech and swallowing.
4.  **Respiration:** Paralysis of respiratory muscles (intercostals and diaphragm) leads to death from asphyxia,.
5.  **Consciousness:** The victim remains **fully conscious** and aware until death occurs from hypoxia.

**Fatal Dose:** 60 mg.
**Fatal Period:** 1 to 2 hours.

**Treatment:**
*   **Artificial Respiration:** This is the most critical step to maintain oxygenation until the drug is metabolized.
*   **Antidote:** **[[Neostigmine]]** (cholinesterase inhibitor) is the physiological antidote.
    *   Dose: 5 to 10 mg I.V., usually preceded by **[[Atropine]]** (0.6 to 1.2 mg) to block muscarinic side effects.
*   **Ligature:** If introduced via a wound (arrow), apply a ligature proximal to the site and wash with Potassium Permanganate ($KMnO_4$).

**Medicolegal Aspects:**
*   **Arrow Poison:** Historically used by South American Indians for hunting,.
*   **Anesthesia:** Used as a muscle relaxant during surgery; death may occur due to overdose or inadequate ventilation,.

### **2. CONIUM MACULATUM (SPOTTED HEMLOCK)**

**Source:**
Also known as **Spotted Hemlock** or Poison Hemlock. It grows in wastelands and is often mistaken for parsley or harmless herbs,.

**Identification Features:**
*   **Stem:** Smooth, hollow, with **purple spots** (hence "Spotted" Hemlock).
*   **Odour:** The fresh plant smells like **mice** (mousy odour) when crushed,.
*   **Root:** Resembles parsnip or sweet potato.

**Active Principles:**
*   **[[Coniine]]** (the most potent, volatile liquid alkaloid).
*   N-methyl coniine, conhydrine.
*   Found in all parts, but highest concentration in unripe fruits and seeds.

**Mode of Action:**
*   **Peripheral:** Like Curare, it blocks the neuromuscular junction causing flaccid paralysis.
*   **Ganglionic:** Initially stimulates, then depresses autonomic ganglia (Nicotinic effect).

**Clinical Features:**
Symptoms appear within 30 minutes to an hour.
1.  **Neuromuscular:** **Ascending Paralysis** is the hallmark. It starts in the lower limbs (weakness of legs, staggering gait) and ascends to the trunk and upper limbs.
2.  **Sensory:** Numbness and paresthesia may be present.
3.  **Bulbar:** Difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia) and speech (dysarthria) due to paralysis of tongue and pharynx.
4.  **Ocular:** Dilated pupils (**[[Mydriasis]]**), ptosis, and diplopia.
5.  **Respiratory:** Death occurs due to respiratory muscle paralysis (asphyxia).
6.  **Mental Status:** The mind remains **clear** until the very end,.

**Fatal Dose:** 60 mg of Coniine.
**Fatal Period:** 1 to 3 hours (Few hours).

**Treatment:**
1.  **Decontamination:** Gastric lavage with $KMnO_4$ and activated charcoal.
2.  **Respiratory Support:** Artificial respiration and Oxygen inhalation are life-saving.
3.  **Symptomatic:** Stimulants for cardiac support.

**Autopsy Findings:**
*   General signs of **[[Asphyxia]]**.
*   Specific: Presence of plant parts (leaves/roots) in the stomach.

**Medicolegal Aspects:**
*   **Accidental:** Most common, due to mistaking the plant for edible vegetables like parsley or parsnips.
*   **Historical Execution:** It was the state poison of Ancient Greece; used to execute the philosopher **[[Socrates]]** in 399 B.C.,,.
