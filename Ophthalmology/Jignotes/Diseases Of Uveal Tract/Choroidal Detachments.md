# [[Diseases Of Uveal Tract]] > Choroidal Detachments

# [[Choroidal Detachment]]

### Definition
[[Choroidal detachment]] refers to the separation of the [[choroid]] from the [[sclera]] due to the accumulation of fluid (serous or hemorrhagic) in the [[suprachoroidal space]] (the potential space between the choroid and the sclera).

### Etiology
The condition can arise from various causes, primarily categorized by mechanism:

1.  **Post-operative (Most Common):**
    *   Occurs frequently after intraocular surgeries, particularly filtration surgeries like [[trabeculectomy]].
    *   **Mechanism:** Excessive filtration leading to sudden lowering of [[intraocular pressure]] (hypotony). This causes vasodilation and exudation of fluid from the choroidal vessels into the outer lamellae of the choroid.
    *   Also seen after [[cataract surgery]] due to wound leak.

2.  **Inflammatory:**
    *   Seen in eyes lost to plastic [[iridocyclitis]].
    *   Associated with posterior [[scleritis]].

3.  **Traumatic:**
    *   Following blunt trauma.
    *   Severe hemorrhage (Suprachoroidal hemorrhage).

4.  **Neoplastic:**
    *   Associated with intraocular tumors or new growths.

5.  **Miscellaneous:**
    *   Following [[glaucoma]] in late stages.
    *   Uveal effusion syndrome.

### Clinical Features

#### Symptoms
*   **Visual Disturbance:** Patients may complain of a shadow or curtain in the field of vision if the detachment is extensive.
*   **Pain:** Often associated with the underlying cause (e.g., post-surgical inflammation or trauma), though the detachment itself may be painless.
*   **Asymptomatic:** Small detachments are often asymptomatic and found on routine examination.

#### Signs
*   **Anterior Chamber (AC):**
    *   **Shallow/Flat AC:** A cardinal sign, especially in post-operative cases.
    *   **Hypotony:** Intraocular pressure is usually low (soft eye).
*   **Pupillary Reflex:**
    *   A dark mass may be seen through the pupil.
*   **Oblique Illumination:**
    *   Visible as a **dark brown mass** behind the pupil.
*   **Fundoscopy:**
    *   **Appearance:** Large, smooth, brownish, convex, immobile lobular masses visible in the periphery.
    *   **Configuration:** These masses may bulge significantly towards the visual axis. In severe cases, the lobes may touch each other ("Kissing choroidals").

### Differential Diagnosis
It is crucial to differentiate a serous [[choroidal detachment]] from a solid tumor (like [[malignant melanoma]] of the choroid) and [[retinal detachment]].

**Table: Differential Diagnosis of Choroidal Detachment vs. Malignant Melanoma**

| Feature | [[Choroidal Detachment]] | [[Malignant Melanoma]] (Choroid) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **History** | Recent surgery, trauma, or hypotony | Gradual vision loss, often spontaneous |
| **IOP** | Low (Hypotony) | Normal or Elevated (Secondary Glaucoma) |
| **Appearance** | Smooth, lobular, dark brown mass | Elevated, pigmented, vascularized mass |
| **Transillumination** | **Transparent/Translucent** | **Opaque** (Blocks light) |
| **Ultrasound** | Suprachoroidal fluid space visible | Solid mass with internal reflectivity |

**Table: Choroidal Detachment vs. Retinal Detachment**

| Feature | [[Choroidal Detachment]] | [[Retinal Detachment]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Appearance** | Solid-looking, smooth, brown/dark | Greyish, undulating/folded membrane |
| **Transillumination** | **Opaque** relative to simple RD (Note: Source states simple RD is transparent while choroidal growth is opaque; Choroidal detachment acts similar to a solid mass regarding reflex but transilluminates better than a tumor) | **Transparent** |
| **Movements** | Immobile | Mobile/Undulating with eye movements |
| **Vessels** | Normal retinal vessels drape over it | Retinal vessels appear dark and tortuous |

### Complications
*   **[[Flat Anterior Chamber]]:** Can lead to corneal decompensation or [[peripheral anterior synechiae]] (PAS) formation.
*   **Secondary Glaucoma:** Chronic angle closure due to PAS.
*   **Cataract:** Progression of lenticular opacities due to metabolic disturbance.
*   **[[Phthisis Bulbi]]:** In severe, untreated cases involving disorganized globes.

### Diagnosis
*   **Slit Lamp Examination:** To assess AC depth and visualize the mass.
*   **[[Transillumination Test]]:** Essential to rule out solid tumors. A strong light source is placed on the sclera; choroidal detachments (serous) will allow light to pass (glow), whereas solid tumors (melanoma) or hemorrhagic detachments will block light.
*   **[[B-scan Ultrasonography]]:** Useful to confirm the presence of fluid in the suprachoroidal space and exclude masses.

### Management

**1. Conservative Management**
Most serous choroidal detachments (especially post-operative) resolve spontaneously as the [[intraocular pressure]] normalizes.
*   **Observation:** Frequent follow-up to monitor AC depth.
*   **Medical Therapy:**
    *   **Topical Steroids & Cycloplegics:** To control inflammation.
    *   **Oral Acetazolamide:** May speed up resorption of subchoroidal fluid.
    *   **Pressure Bandage:** Sometimes used to tamponade the eye.

**2. Surgical Management**
Indicated if the condition persists ("Kissing choroidals"), if the anterior chamber is flat causing lenticulo-corneal touch (risk of corneal decompensation), or if there is a non-resolving wound leak.
*   **Suprachoroidal Drainage:** Surgical drainage of the fluid from the suprachoroidal space via sclerotomy.
*   **AC Reformation:** Injection of air, viscoelastic, or balanced salt solution into the [[anterior chamber]] to restore depth.
*   **Repair of Wound Leak:** If the etiology is a leaking surgical wound, it must be sutured.

**Clinical Implication:**
In any patient presenting with a shallow [[anterior chamber]] and hypotony shortly after [[trabeculectomy]] or cataract surgery, **[[ciliochoroidal detachment]]** should be the primary suspicion. Differentiate immediately from **[[malignant glaucoma]]** (ciliary block), which presents with a flat AC but **high** intraocular pressure.
