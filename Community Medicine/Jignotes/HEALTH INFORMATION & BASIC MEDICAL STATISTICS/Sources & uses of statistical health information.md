# [[HEALTH INFORMATION & BASIC MEDICAL STATISTICS]] > Sources & uses of statistical health information

### Uses of Health Information (Statistics)

Health information is the lifeblood of the national health system. It serves as a tool for management and a key input for societal progress. The primary objectives are to provide reliable, relevant, adequate, and timely information for decision-makers.

The major uses include,,:

1.  **Measurement of Health Status:** To quantify health problems and medical/health care needs of the people.
2.  **Comparison:** For local, national, and international comparisons of health status (requires rigorous standardization).
3.  **Planning and Management:** Essential for effective management, planning, and administration of health services and programs.
4.  **Evaluation:** To assess if health services are accomplishing their objectives regarding **effectiveness** and **efficiency**.
5.  **Assessment of Attitudes:** To gauge the degree of satisfaction of the beneficiaries with the health system.
6.  **Research:** To investigate particular problems of health and disease.

### Sources of Health Information

The requirements vary by administrative level, but the following are the primary sources of statistical data,:

#### 1. [[Census]]
*   **Definition:** The total process of collecting, compiling, and publishing demographic, economic, and social data pertaining to all persons in a country at a specified time,.
*   **Frequency:** Conducted every **10 years** in India.
*   **Key Data:** Total population, age and sex distribution, literacy, social/economic characteristics.
*   **Legal Basis:** The Census Act of 1948.
*   **Limitation:** Full results are usually not available quickly.

#### 2. [[Registration of Vital Events]]
*   **Concept:** Unlike the intermittent census, this keeps a continuous check on demographic changes (births, deaths, marriages),.
*   **Legal Framework:** **The Central Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1969** makes registration compulsory. Time limit is usually **21 days** for births and deaths.
*   **Challenges:** In developing countries, civil registration is often defective or incomplete.

#### 3. [[Sample Registration System (SRS)]]
*   **Purpose:** To provide reliable estimates of birth and death rates at state and national levels since civil registration is often deficient,.
*   **Mechanism:** It is a **dual-record system**:
    1.  Continuous enumeration by a part-time enumerator.
    2.  Independent survey every 6 months by a supervisor.
    *   The results are matched and verified to minimize errors.

#### 4. Notification of Diseases
*   **Purpose:** Primary purpose is the prevention and/or control of disease. It provides early warning of outbreaks,.
*   **Coverage:** Lists vary by country. Under **International Health Regulations (IHR)**, diseases like Cholera, Plague, and Yellow Fever are notifiable to WHO.
*   **Limitation:** suffers from under-reporting; covers only a small part of total sickness (mostly acute); atypical/subclinical cases are missed.

#### 5. Hospital Records
*   **Value:** Provides info on diagnosis, duration of stay, cost of care, and morbidity patterns.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Constitutes only the **"Tip of the Iceberg"** (only those seeking care are counted).
    *   Admission policies vary (selection bias).
    *   Denominator (population at risk) is undefined.

#### 6. Disease Registers
*   **Definition:** A permanent record established for follow-up and basic statistical tabulation of frequency and survival.
*   **Examples:** Tuberculosis, Leprosy, Cancer, Stroke, Blindness, Congenital defects.
*   **Utility:** Valuable for studying the natural course of disease and survival rates.

#### 7. Record Linkage
*   **Medical Record Linkage:** The process of bringing together records relating to one individual from different times or places.
*   **Use:** Suitable for studying associations between diseases.

#### 8. Epidemiological Surveillance
*   Surveillance systems provide data on the occurrence and distribution of disease, often using **sentinel surveillance** to identify missing cases and supplement notified cases.

#### 9. Population Surveys
*   Used when routine statistics are inadequate. They can evaluate health status, investigate factors affecting health, or assess administration of services,.
*   **Types:** Health interview (face-to-face) survey, Health examination survey, Health records survey, Mailed questionnaire.
*   **Example:** [[National Family Health Survey (NFHS)]].

#### 10. Other Sources
*   **Environmental Health Data:** Pollution, water, housing.
*   **Health Manpower Statistics:** Records of physicians, nurses, etc., maintained by state councils.
*   **Non-quantifiable Information:** Health policies, legislation, public attitudes.

### Mnemonics

**"C-R-S N-H-D E-P"** (Sources of Stats)
*   **C**ensus
*   **R**egistration of Vital Events
*   **S**ample Registration System (SRS)
*   **N**otification of Disease
*   **H**ospital Records
*   **D**isease Registers
*   **E**pidemiological Surveillance
*   **P**opulation Surveys

**Clinical Relevance:**
*   **Community Diagnosis:** Just as a clinician uses lab reports to diagnose a patient, a public health specialist uses these statistical sources to diagnose the health of the community.
*   **Outbreak Management:** Notification data allows for rapid response to epidemics (e.g., Cholera) before they spread widely.
