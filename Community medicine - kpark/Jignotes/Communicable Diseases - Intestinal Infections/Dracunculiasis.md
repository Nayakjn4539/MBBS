# Dracunculiasis (Guinea Worm Disease)

Dracunculiasis is a vector-borne parasitic disease caused by the nematode *Dracunculus medinensis*. While rarely fatal, it causes significant temporary disability and economic loss. It is one of the few diseases targeted for global [[Eradication]].

### Epidemiological Determinants

*   **Agent:** [[Dracunculus medinensis]] (Guinea worm).
    *   **Nature:** It is a tissue roundworm (Nematode).
    *   **Size:** The female is very long (55–120 cm), while the male is short (2–3 cm) and dies after mating.
*   **Reservoir:** **Man is the only known reservoir.** (This absence of an animal reservoir is a key factor making eradication possible).
*   **Vector/Intermediate Host:** [[Cyclops]] (Water flea).
*   **Definitive Host:** Man.

### Transmission
*   **Mode:** Strictly water-borne (Ingestion).
*   **Mechanism:** Drinking water from stagnant sources (ponds, step-wells) contaminated with Cyclops containing infective **L3 larvae**.
*   **Type of Transmission:** [[Cyclo-developmental transmission]] (The parasite undergoes developmental changes in the vector but does not multiply).
*   **Human-to-Human:** There is **no** direct human-to-human transmission.

### Life Cycle

> Life cycle of Guinea worm showing ingestion of Cyclops, maturation in humans, blister formation on leg, and release of larvae back into water

1.  **Ingestion:** Man drinks water containing infected Cyclops.
2.  **Liberation:** Gastric acid digests Cyclops; larvae are released and penetrate the duodenal wall.
3.  **Maturation:** Larvae migrate to retroperitoneal connective tissues, mature, and mate. Male dies.
4.  **Migration:** Gravid female migrates to subcutaneous tissues, usually the lower limbs (90% of cases).
5.  **Emergence:** On contact with water, the female worm induces a blister which bursts, releasing millions of larvae into the water to be eaten by Cyclops.

*   **Incubation Period:** **10–14 months** (Usually 1 year).
    *   *Clinical Relevance:* The long incubation period ensures the worm emerges during the next dry season when water sources are scarce and usage is concentrated, facilitating transmission.

### Clinical Picture
*   **Asymptomatic Phase:** The infection remains silent for about a year during the migration phase.
*   **Prodromal Symptoms:** A few days before worm emergence, allergic manifestations occur (urticaria, nausea, vomiting, fever) due to toxin release.
*   **Emergence:** A painful blister/papule appears, usually on the foot or ankle.
*   **Ulceration:** The blister bursts on contact with water. The patient experiences a severe **burning sensation**, which is relieved by immersing the limb in water (a behavior that unfortunately perpetuates the life cycle).
*   **Complications:** Secondary bacterial infection, abscesses, fibrous ankylosis of joints (frozen joints), and permanent disability.

### Diagnosis
*   **Visual:** Identification of the adult worm emerging from the skin lesion.
*   **Microscopy:** Detection of larvae released from the worm upon contact with cold water.

### Treatment
There is **no specific drug** to kill the adult worm immediately. Treatment focuses on facilitating removal and preventing inflammation.

1.  **Mechanical Extraction:** Rolling the worm out slowly on a small stick (a few centimeters per day) to prevent breaking the worm.
2.  **Drugs:** [[Metronidazole]] (400 mg TDS) or **Niridazole** or **Mebendazole**.
    *   *Note:* These drugs act as anti-inflammatory agents to make extraction easier; they do not kill the worm directly.
3.  **Wound Care:** Occlusive dressings and antibiotics/tetanus toxoid to prevent secondary infection.

### Prevention and Eradication Strategy
Since the disease has no vaccine and no animal reservoir, eradication relies entirely on breaking the chain of transmission.

**Strategy Mnemonics: STEP towards Eradication**
*   **S** - **Sieving** water (Physical removal of Cyclops)
*   **T** - **T**emephos (Chemical control)
*   **E** - **E**ducation (Health education)
*   **P** - **P**iped water (Safe water supply)

#### 1. Provision of Safe Water
*   Conversion of step-wells into draw-wells.
*   Installation of hand pumps and piped water supplies.

#### 2. Vector Control (Cyclops)
*   **Chemical:** Application of [[Temephos]] (Abate) 50% EC to unsafe water sources. It is highly effective and safe for humans.
*   **Biological:** Use of larvivorous fish like Gambusia and Barbel (less common for Cyclops than mosquitoes).
*   **Physical:** Sieving water through a **double-fold cotton cloth** filters out Cyclops. Boiling water is also effective.

#### 3. Management of Cases
*   **Surveillance:** Active search for cases during the transmission season.
*   **Containment:** Preventing infected individuals from entering water sources.

### Status of Eradication
The World Health Organization (WHO) targets Dracunculiasis for global eradication (along with Polio and Measles).

*   **Global Status:** The disease is on the verge of eradication, confined to a few pockets in Africa (e.g., Chad, Ethiopia).
*   **India Status:**
    *   **Last Case:** Reported in July 1996 from Jodhpur, Rajasthan.
    *   **Elimination Certification:** WHO certified India as **Guinea Worm Disease Free** in **February 2000**.
