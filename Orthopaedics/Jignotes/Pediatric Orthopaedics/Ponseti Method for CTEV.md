# [[Pediatric Orthopaedics]] > Ponseti Method for CTEV

# Ponseti Method for Congenital Talipes Equino Varus (CTEV)

### Introduction
The [[Ponseti method]] is currently considered the gold standard for the non-operative treatment of [[Congenital Talipes Equinovarus]] (Clubfoot). Developed by Dr. Ignacio Ponseti, this technique relies on the inherent biomechanical properties of the infant foot and the viscoelastic nature of the connective tissues.

**Goal:** To obtain a painless, plantigrade, pliable, and functional foot.

### Pathoanatomy and Sequence of Correction
The deformity in CTEV is complex, involving multiple joints. The sequence of correction is critical and follows the mnemonic **CAVE**.

| Sequence | Deformity | Site | Correction Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **C**avus | Forefoot relative to Hindfoot | **Supination** of the forefoot (aligning forefoot to hindfoot) |
| **2** | **A**dduction | Midfoot | **Abduction** around the head of the talus |
| **3** | **V**arus | Hindfoot (Subtalar joint) | Corrects automatically with abduction (due to coupling of motion) |
| **4** | **E**quinus | Ankle joint | **Dorsiflexion** (often requires tenotomy) |

**Mnemonic:** **CAVE** (The order of deformities). The correction order is Cavus first, then Adduction and Varus together, and Equinus last.

### The Manipulation and Casting Phase

The treatment should ideally begin as soon as possible after birth (usually 7–10 days).

#### 1. Correction of Cavus
*   **Pathology:** [[Cavus]] is caused by the pronation of the forefoot in relation to the hindfoot. The first metatarsal is plantarflexed.
*   **Technique:** The forefoot is **supinated** (elevated) to align it with the varus hindfoot.
*   **Clinical Implication:** A common error is to pronate the foot to make it look "straight," which actually worsens the cavus deformity. The Ponseti method emphasizes supination to correct the "relative pronation" of the forefoot.

#### 2. Correction of Adduction and Varus
*   **Fulcrum:** The head of the [[talus]] is the pivotal point. The thumb is placed over the lateral aspect of the talar head (not the calcaneocuboid joint).
*   **Technique:** The foot is gradually **abducted** while stabilizing the talus. This allows the [[navicular]] to move laterally away from the medial malleolus and the [[calcaneus]] to abduct and evert under the talus.
*   **Casting:**
    *   Long-leg (Above-knee) plaster casts are applied after each manipulation.
    *   **Knee position:** 90° flexion.
    *   **Duration:** Weekly cast changes. Usually requires 5–7 casts.
    *   **Goal:** To achieve approximately **60–70 degrees of abduction** relative to the tibia.

#### 3. Correction of Equinus
*   **Timing:** Addressed **only** after the cavus, adduction, and varus are fully corrected (foot abduction reaches ~70°).
*   **Technique:** Gentle dorsiflexion.
*   **Percutaneous Tenotomy:** In 85–90% of cases, the [[Achilles tendon]] is too tight to allow full dorsiflexion by stretching alone.
    *   **Procedure:** [[Percutaneous tenotomy]] of the tendo-Achilles is performed under local anesthesia.
    *   **Post-Tenotomy:** A final cast is applied with the foot in maximum abduction (70°) and dorsiflexion (15-20°) for 3 weeks to allow tendon healing.

### Maintenance Phase: Bracing Protocol
After the final cast is removed, the correction must be maintained to prevent recurrence due to the viscoelastic memory of the soft tissues.

**Device:** [[Denis Browne Splint]] (DB Splint) or **Foot Abduction Orthosis (FAO)**.
*   The shoes are attached to a bar.
*   **Involved side:** Set at **70° external rotation**.
*   **Normal side:** Set at **40–45° external rotation**.
*   **Bar length:** Equal to the shoulder width of the infant.

#### Bracing Schedule (Strict Adherence Required)
| Period | Duration |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Initial Phase** | 23 hours/day for the first 3 months. |
| **Weaning Phase** | Gradually reduced to night-time and nap-time wear. |
| **Maintenance** | Night-time wear continues until the child is **3 to 4 years old**. |

**Clinical Implication:** The most common cause of recurrence in CTEV treated by the Ponseti method is non-compliance with the bracing protocol.

### Complications and Pitfalls

1.  **Rocker Bottom Foot:**
    *   **Cause:** Forceful dorsiflexion against a tight tendo-Achilles *before* correcting the varus/adduction, or using the [[calcaneocuboid joint]] as a fulcrum instead of the talar head.
    *   **Result:** Break in the midfoot (spurious correction) rather than true ankle dorsiflexion.
2.  **Cast Sores/Pressure Ulcers:** Due to improper padding or technique.
3.  **Crowded Toes:** Tight casting.
4.  **Recurrence:** Usually due to poor brace compliance. Treated by re-casting (usually 2–3 casts) followed by re-tenotomy or [[Tibialis Anterior Tendon Transfer]] (TATT) if the child is older (>2.5 years).

### Summary of Ponseti Management Steps

1.  **Identify** deformities (CAVE).
2.  **Manipulate:** Supinate forefoot (correct cavus) $\rightarrow$ Abduct around talus (correct adduction/varus).
3.  **Immobilize:** Above-knee cast, weekly changes.
4.  **Tenotomy:** If residual equinus exists after varus correction (most cases).
5.  **Brace:** [[Steenbeek brace]] or Denis Browne splint to prevent recurrence.
