# [[Upper Limb]] > Monteggia Fracture Dislocation

# [[Monteggia Fracture Dislocation]]

### Definition
A **Monteggia Fracture Dislocation** is defined as a fracture of the proximal third of the [[ulna]] associated with the dislocation of the head of the [[radius]] (proximal radioulnar joint). 
It is famously termed a **"Fracture of Necessity"** because open surgical reduction is almost always necessary for a successful outcome in adults.

### Mechanism of Injury
*   **Hyperpronation Injury:** Fall on an outstretched hand with the forearm in excessive pronation.
*   **Direct Blow:** A direct blow to the back of the upper forearm (e.g., raising the arm to protect the head from a stick), often causing the "Nightstick fracture" variant which can lead to this complex injury.

### Classification: Bado’s Classification
This is the standard classification system based on the direction of the displacement of the radial head and the angulation of the ulnar fracture.

| Type | Description | Frequency |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type I** | **Anterior** dislocation of the [[radial head]] with fracture of the ulnar diaphysis (angulated anteriorly). | Most Common |
| **Type II** | **Posterior** dislocation of the [[radial head]] with fracture of the ulnar diaphysis (angulated posteriorly). | Common in adults |
| **Type III** | **Lateral** dislocation of the [[radial head]] with fracture of the ulnar metaphysis. | Rare |
| **Type IV** | **Anterior** dislocation of the [[radial head]] with fracture of both the [[radius]] and [[ulna]]. | Rare |

**Note:** A variant called **Hume’s fracture** is an olecranon fracture associated with anterior dislocation of the radial head.

### Clinical Features
*   **Pain and Swelling:** Located at the elbow and upper forearm.
*   **Deformity:** The ulna is visibly deformed/angulated.
*   **Palpation:** The head of the radius is palpable in an abnormal position (anterior, posterior, or lateral).
*   **Neurological Deficit:** Check for signs of nerve injury (see complications below).

### Diagnosis and Imaging
*   **X-ray:** Anteroposterior (AP) and Lateral views of the forearm including the **wrist** and **elbow** joints.
*   **Radiological Clue:** A fracture of the ulna should always trigger a check of the radiocapitellar line.
    *   **Normal:** A line drawn through the shaft of the radius and head should pass through the center of the [[capitulum]] in all views.
    *   **Monteggia:** This line is disrupted.

### Management

#### 1. In Children
*   **Closed Reduction:** Usually managed conservatively.
*   **Technique:** Closed reduction of the ulnar angulation usually reduces the radial head spontaneously.
*   **Immobilization:** Immobilized in a cast (often in supination for Type I).

#### 2. In Adults
*   **Surgery is Mandatory:** Conservative treatment often fails due to the deforming forces of the forearm muscles.
*   **Principle:** Anatomical reduction and rigid internal fixation of the [[ulna]] restores the length and usually reduces the [[radial head]] automatically.
*   **Procedure:** 
    *   **Open Reduction and Internal Fixation ([[ORIF]]):** The ulna is fixed using a compression plate.
    *   **Radial Head:** Once the ulna is fixed to length, the radial head usually reduces. If it remains unstable, open reduction of the joint or repair of the [[annular ligament]] may be required.

### Complications
*   **Malunion:** Common if not treated surgically; leads to restriction of pronation and supination.
*   **Nonunion:** Of the ulnar fracture.
*   **Nerve Injury:** The **[[Posterior Interosseous Nerve]] (PIN)**, a branch of the [[radial nerve]], is the most commonly injured nerve.
    *   *Clinical Sign:* Finger drop and thumb drop with **no sensory deficit** (purely motor nerve).
*   **Cross Union (Synostosis):** Fusion between the radius and ulna, blocking rotation.
*   **Myositis Ossificans:** Calcification within the muscles.
*   **Recurrent Dislocation:** If the ulnar malaligns or the annular ligament remains entrapped.

### Clinical Implications
*   **"Rule of Two":** In any forearm fracture, always X-ray the joint **above** (elbow) and **below** (wrist) to avoid missing a Monteggia or [[Galeazzi fracture dislocation]].
*   **Isolated Ulna Fracture:** An isolated fracture of the proximal ulna is rare; always suspect and rule out a radial head dislocation.

### Mnemonics
*   **MUGR** (describing the bone that is fractured):
    *   **M**onteggia = **U**lna fracture (proximal).
    *   **G**aleazzi = **R**adius fracture (distal).
*   **GRUesome MURder**:
    *   **G**aleazzi = **R**adius fracture + **U**lna (distal) dislocation.
    *   **M**onteggia = **U**lna fracture + **R**adius (head) dislocation.
