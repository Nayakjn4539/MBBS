# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Case finding methods in Leprosy

### Case Finding Methods in [[Leprosy]]

The primary aim of case finding in leprosy is to identify and register all cases as soon as possible after they become evident to interrupt transmission and prevent disabilities. The choice of the method depends largely on the **prevalence rate** of leprosy in the region.

#### 1. Epidemiological Methods Based on Prevalence
The strategy for active case detection is tailored to the disease load in the community:

| Method | Indication (Prevalence Rate) | Target Population & Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Contact Survey** | **Low Endemicity**<br>(< 1 case per 1000 population) | • Screening of **household contacts** of known cases.<br>• Contacts are at high risk; detecting cases here yields high results with less effort. |
| **Group Survey** | **Moderate Endemicity**<br>(> 1 case per 1000 population) | • Screening specific vulnerable groups: School children, slum dwellers, military recruits, and industrial laborers.<br>• Organizing **"Skin Camps"** for screening all types of skin diseases to detect hidden leprosy cases. |
| **Mass Survey** | **Hyperendemic Areas**<br>(> 10 cases per 1000 population) | • **Total population survey**: House-to-house visits.<br>• Examination of every individual, family-by-family.<br>• A coverage of not less than **95%** of the population is required. |

> **Mnemonic for Survey Types:**
> **M**ass **G**roup **C**ontact (**MGC**)
> *Think:* **M**ore cases (**M**ass survey) $\rightarrow$ **G**eneral/Moderate cases (**G**roup survey) $\rightarrow$ **C**ountable/Few cases (**C**ontact survey).

#### 2. Special Action Projects and Campaigns
To cover populations that are difficult to reach or live in urban slums, specific strategies were introduced under the [[National Leprosy Eradication Programme]] (NLEP):

*   **SAPEL (Special Action Projects for Elimination of Leprosy):** Designed for rural, remote, and inaccessible areas (e.g., tribal, hilly, or insurgent areas) where regular programme activities are difficult to implement.
*   **LEC (Leprosy Elimination Campaigns):** Specifically designed for **urban areas** to detect cases among the migrating population and slums which might be missed by routine services.
*   **LCDC (Leprosy Case Detection Campaign):** A campaign mode activity (similar to Pulse Polio) carried out in high endemic districts. Teams make house-to-house visits to detect hidden cases.
*   **ABSULS (ASHA Based Surveillance for Leprosy Suspects):** Launched in 2019, this involves door-to-door surveillance by [[ASHA]] workers to identify suspects early.
*   **Focused Leprosy Campaign:** House-to-house surveys in villages or urban areas (hotspots) where Grade 2 disability cases are detected.

#### 3. Voluntary Reporting (Passive Case Finding)
*   Ideally, patients should seek medical care voluntarily when they notice symptoms.
*   However, due to the painless nature of early lesions and **social stigma**, there is often a lag period of 2 to 3 years before patients report.
*   **Health Education** is vital here to encourage voluntary reporting by removing fear and superstitions.

#### 4. Role of Health Workers (ASHA)
Under the current integrated system, the [[Accredited Social Health Activist]] (ASHA) plays a pivotal role:
*   **Search:** She searches for suspected cases (persons with skin patches, nodules, or numbness) during her village visits.
*   **Incentives:** ASHAs are paid incentives for:
    *   Confirmed diagnosis of a new case brought by them.
    *   Ensuring completion of treatment (higher incentive for Multibacillary cases).

#### 5. Diagnosis Criteria for Case Finding
A case is identified based on the presence of at least **one** of the **Cardinal Signs**:
1.  **Hypopigmented or reddish skin lesion(s)** with definite loss of sensation (sensory deficit).
2.  **Involvement of peripheral nerves**, demonstrated by thickening and tenderness, often with loss of sensation or muscle weakness.
3.  **Demonstration of [[Mycobacterium leprae]]** in skin smears (Acid-Fast Bacilli).

> **Clinical Relevance:**
> **Early detection is the only prevention for disability.**
> By the time a patient voluntarily reports (Passive finding), the disease may have advanced. **Active case finding** (Surveys/LCDC) is crucial to find cases *before* nerve damage becomes irreversible.
