### **Clinical Relevance**
*   **[[Certification]]:** Doctors (Insurance Medical Officers) play a crucial role. Sickness, maternity, and disablement benefits are entirely dependent on the **medical certificate** issued by the doctor. Improper certification can lead to legal issues.
*   **[[Occupational Diseases]]:** Doctors must recognize diseases listed in **Schedule III** of the Act (e.g., Silicosis, Lead poisoning) to enable workers to claim disablement benefits.
*   **[[Rehabilitation]]:** Physicians should actively refer disabled workers for physical and vocational rehabilitation provided under the scheme.
