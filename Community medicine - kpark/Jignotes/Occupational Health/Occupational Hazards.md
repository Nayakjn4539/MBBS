# [[Occupational Health]] > Occupational Hazards

### **Occupational Hazards**

**Definition:**
[[Occupational Hazards]] refer to the sum of external conditions and influences prevailing at the place of work that have a bearing on the health of the working population. These result from the interaction between the worker, the work environment, and the agents (physical, chemical, biological).

---

### **1. Physical Hazards**
These are the most common hazards in industries, arising from the physical environment.

| **Agent** | **Effects / Conditions** | **Occupational Exposure/Risk Groups** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Heat** | Burns, [[Heat Exhaustion]], Heat Stroke, Heat Cramps, Prickly heat. | Foundry workers, Glass and Steel industries, Mines, Textile mills. |
| **Cold** | [[Frostbite]], Trench foot, Chilblains. | Soldiers in high altitude, Ice plants, Food storage. |
| **Light** | **Poor illumination:** Miner's Nystagmus, eye strain.<br>**Excessive brightness:** Glare, blurred vision. | Mines, Precision work (watchmaking), Drafting. |
| **Noise** | **Auditory:** Temporary/Permanent hearing loss.<br>**Non-auditory:** Nervousness, fatigue, hypertension. | Heavy machinery, Textile looms, Pneumatic drills. |
| **Vibration** | **White Fingers** ([[Raynaud's phenomenon]]), injuries to joints of hands/elbows. | Workers using pneumatic drills, hammers. |
| **Radiation** | **UV rays:** [[Arc Eye]] (Welder’s flash/conjunctivitis).<br>**Ionizing (X-rays):** Leukemia, Aplastic anemia, Skin cancer, Sterility. | Welders (UV), Radiologists, Nuclear plant workers (Ionizing). |
| **Pressure** | **[[Caisson Disease]]** (Decompression sickness): "The Bends", air embolism. | Deep-sea divers, Underwater tunnel workers. |

*   **Clinical Relevance:** **Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL)** typically causes a "dip" in the audiogram at the frequency of **4000 Hz**.
*   **Permissible Noise Limit:** 85-90 dB for an 8-hour shift.

### **2. Chemical Hazards**
Chemical agents act via local action, inhalation (most common), or ingestion.

#### **A. Dusts (Pneumoconiosis)**
Diseases caused by dust particles (usually **0.5 to 3 microns** in size) depositing in the lungs.

| **Disease** | **Causative Dust** | **Industry** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Silicosis]]** | Free Silica ($SiO_2$) | Mining, Pottery, Sandblasting, Stone cutting. |
| **[[Anthracosis]]** | Coal Dust | Coal miners ("Black Lung"). |
| **[[Asbestosis]]** | Asbestos | Cement roofing, Brake lining, Fireproofing. *Risk of Mesothelioma.* |
| **[[Byssinosis]]** | Cotton Dust | Textile industries ("Monday Morning Fever"). |
| **[[Bagassosis]]** | Bagasse (Sugarcane fiber) | Cardboard/Paper manufacturing. Caused by *Thermoactinomyces sacchari*. |
| **[[Farmer's Lung]]** | Mouldy Hay/Grain | Agriculture. Caused by *Micropolyspora faeni*. |

> **Mnemonic for Pneumoconiosis:** **"SABBC"**
> *   **S** - Silicosis (Sand/Stone)
> *   **A** - Asbestosis (Asbestos) / Anthracosis (Anthracite coal)
> *   **B** - Bagassosis (Bagasse)
> *   **B** - Byssinosis (Bale of cotton)
> *   **C** - Chalicosis (Calcium/Stone)

#### **B. Metals and Chemicals**
*   **[[Lead Poisoning]] (Plumbism):**
    *   *Source:* Batteries, Printing, Paint, Pottery, Gasoline.
    *   *Clinical Features:* Abdominal colic, constipation, **[[Wrist Drop]]** (radial nerve palsy), **Burtonian Line** (blue line on gums), Basophilic stippling of RBCs.
*   **Gases:**
    *   *Asphyxiants:* Carbon Monoxide (CO), Cyanide.
    *   *Irritants:* Ammonia, Sulfur dioxide, Chlorine.
*   **Solvents:** Benzene (Leukemia), Carbon bisulfide.

### **3. Biological Hazards**
Workers exposed to living agents (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites) or their products.

*   **Bacteria:**
    *   **[[Brucellosis]]:** Veterinary workers, livestock handlers.
    *   **[[Anthrax]]:** Wool sorters, tanners, shepherds (Cutaneous/Pulmonary "Wool Sorter's Disease").
    *   **Tetanus:** Agricultural workers, construction workers.
    *   **Leptospirosis:** Sewer workers, rice field workers, miners.
*   **Viruses:**
    *   **Hepatitis B & HIV:** Health care workers (needle stick injuries).
    *   **Rabies:** Dog catchers, veterinarians.
*   **Parasites:**
    *   **Hookworm:** Farmers/miners (Ancylostomiasis from walking barefoot on soil).
    *   **Hydatid disease:** Shepherds (contact with dogs).

---

### **Occupational Cancers**
*   **Skin:** Coal tar, X-rays.
*   **Lung:** Asbestos, Arsenic, Nickel, Chromates.
*   **Bladder:** Aniline dyes (benzidine, beta-naphthylamine).
*   **Leukemia:** Benzol, Roentgen rays.

### **Prevention and Control Measures**

#### **A. Medical Measures**
1.  **Pre-placement Examination:** Foundation of occupational health; placing the right man in the right job ([[Ergonomics]]).
2.  **Periodical Examination:** To detect early deviation from health (e.g., monthly check for lead workers).
3.  **Medical Care:** First aid, immunization (e.g., Tetanus, Hep B).
4.  **Notification:** Notifying diseases under the [[Factories Act 1948]].

#### **B. Engineering Measures**
1.  **Designing of Building:** Proper floor space (500 cu. ft per worker), lighting, and ventilation.
2.  **Good Housekeeping:** Cleanliness, white-washing.
3.  **Substitution:** Replacing harmful substances with harmless ones (e.g., silver nitrate instead of mercury in mirrors).
4.  **Dust Control:** Wet drilling, exhaust ventilation.
5.  **Enclosure/Isolation:** Enclosing the machine or process to prevent escape of dust/fumes.
6.  **Protective Devices:** Respirators, ear muffs, gloves, lead aprons, helmets.

#### **C. Legislative Measures**
*   **[[The Factories Act, 1948]]:** Regulates health, safety, welfare, working hours, and leave.
*   **[[Employees State Insurance Act, 1948]] (ESI Act):** Provides social security and medical benefits.
