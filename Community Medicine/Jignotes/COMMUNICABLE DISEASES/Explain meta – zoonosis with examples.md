# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Explain meta – zoonosis with examples

### **Meta-Zoonosis**

**Definition**
**[[Meta-zoonosis]]** refers to a specific category of **[[zoonoses]]** (infections transmissible between vertebrate animals and humans) that requires both a **vertebrate host** and an **invertebrate vector** for the transmission of the infectious agent.

**Key Characteristics**
*   **Biological Transmission:** The transmission is strictly **biological**. This means the infectious agent must undergo **multiplication**, **development**, or both within the body of the invertebrate vector.
*   **Extrinsic Incubation Period:** There is always a mandatory time interval, known as the **[[extrinsic incubation period]]** (or prepatent period), required for the agent to mature or multiply in the vector before it becomes infective and can be transmitted to a new vertebrate host.
*   **Vector Involvement:** An invertebrate vector (e.g., mosquito, flea, tick, snail) is an essential part of the life cycle.

**Examples of Meta-Zoonoses**
| Disease | Agent | Vertebrate Host | Invertebrate Vector |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Plague]]** | *Yersinia pestis* | Rodents (e.g., rats) | Rat Flea (*Xenopsylla cheopis*) |
| **[[Arbovirus infections]]** | Various viruses | Animals/Birds | Mosquitoes/Ticks (e.g., Yellow Fever, JE) |
| **[[Schistosomiasis]]** | *Schistosoma spp.* | Mammals | Snail |
| **[[Leishmaniasis]]** | *Leishmania spp.* | Dogs/Rodents | Sandfly |

**Comparison with Other Types of Zoonoses**
To distinguish **[[Meta-zoonosis]]**, recall the classification based on the life cycle:
*   **Direct Zoonosis:** Transmitted by direct contact or a mechanical vector (e.g., [[Rabies]], [[Brucellosis]]).
*   **Cyclo-Zoonosis:** Requires more than one vertebrate host species but **no invertebrate host** (e.g., [[Taeniasis]], [[Echinococcosis]]).
*   **Sapro-Zoonosis:** Requires a vertebrate host and a **non-animal** reservoir like soil or plants (e.g., [[Mycoses]], [[Larva migrans]]).

**Clinical Relevance**
Identifying a disease as a **[[meta-zoonosis]]** dictates the public health response. Since the life cycle depends entirely on the invertebrate host:
*   **[[Vector Control]]** becomes the primary strategy for disease prevention (e.g., using DDT for sandflies in Leishmaniasis or destroying snail habitats for Schistosomiasis).
*   Interrupting the cycle at the vector stage is often more feasible than eliminating the vertebrate reservoir.

**Mnemonic**
To remember the definition and examples:
**"META MAPS"**
*   **M** - **M**eta-zoonosis (Multiplies in vector)
*   **A** - **A**rboviral infections (Yellow fever, Dengue)
*   **P** - **P**lague
*   **S** - **S**chistosomiasis
