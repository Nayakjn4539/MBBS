# Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)

### Overview
[[Optical Coherence Tomography]] (OCT) is a non-invasive, non-contact imaging modality that uses light waves to take cross-sectional pictures of the [[retina]], [[optic nerve]], and [[anterior segment]]. It provides high-resolution images that are often described as an **"optical biopsy"** of the living tissue.

### Principle and Mechanism
*   **Principle:** Uses the principle of **[[Low coherence interferometry]]**.
*   **Analogy:** The operation of OCT is analogous to [[Ultrasonography]] B-scan, except that **light** is used instead of acoustic/sound waves.
*   **Physics:** It measures the time delay and intensity of reflected light (backscattering) from tissue structures.
    *   Because the speed of light is too high to measure directly, it uses an **interferometer** to compare the light path from the tissue with a reference path.
*   **Resolution:** It provides a resolution of less than **10 $\mu$m** (micron) axially, which is much higher than ultrasound.

### Types of OCT Machines
The technology has evolved through several generations, improving speed and resolution.

| Type of OCT | Description | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Time Domain OCT]] (TD-OCT)** | The reference mirror moves mechanically to scan depth. | Slower acquisition speed (400 axial scans/sec). Lower resolution. |
| **[[Frequency Domain OCT]] (FD-OCT)** | Also called Spectral Domain OCT (SD-OCT). The reference mirror is stationary; uses a spectrometer. | **Current Standard.** Much faster (20,000-40,000 scans/sec). Higher resolution (5-7 $\mu$m). Minimizes motion artifacts. |
| **[[Swept Source OCT]] (SS-OCT)** | Uses a tunable laser source that sweeps across frequencies. | Very high speed (>100,000 scans/sec). Deeper penetration (choroid/sclera visualization). Uses longer wavelength (1050 nm). |

### Normal OCT Interpretation

> Cross-sectional OCT scan of a normal macula showing foveal depression and retinal layers

**Landmarks on a Macular Scan:**
1.  **[[Fovea]]:** Visible as a central depression due to the absence of inner retinal layers (foveal pit).
2.  **[[Retinal Pigment Epithelium]] (RPE):** Appears as a highly reflective (bright red or white) band at the outer limit of the retina.
3.  **[[Neurosensory Retina]]:** The layers above the RPE.
4.  **Reflectivity:**
    *   **Hyper-reflective (Bright/Red/White):** RPE, Nerve Fiber Layer (NFL), Plexiform layers, Fibrosis, Hard exudates, Hemorrhage.
    *   **Hypo-reflective (Dark/Black):** Nuclear layers, **Fluid** (Cysts, Subretinal fluid), Vitreous (unless hemorrhage/inflammation is present).

### Clinical Applications: Posterior Segment OCT

OCT is indispensable for the diagnosis and management of macular and retinal diseases.

#### 1. Macular Holes
OCT is the gold standard for staging macular holes (Gass Classification).
*   **Stage 1 (Impending hole):** Loss of foveal depression, cystic changes, or foveal detachment (pseudocyst).
*   **Stage 2:** Small full-thickness hole (<400 $\mu$m).
*   **Stage 3:** Full-thickness hole (>400 $\mu$m) with partial [[vitreous detachment]] but no Weiss ring.
*   **Stage 4:** Full-thickness hole with complete [[posterior vitreous detachment]] (Weiss ring visible).
*   **Watzke-Allen Sign Correlation:** A slit beam over the fovea is perceived as broken by the patient in full-thickness holes.

#### 2. Cystoid Macular Edema (CME)
*   **Appearance:** Loss of foveal depression with multiple **hypo-reflective** (dark) cystic spaces separated by septa in the outer plexiform and inner nuclear layers.
*   **Flower Petal Appearance:** Seen on [[Fundus Fluorescein Angiography]] (FFA), but OCT quantifies the thickness.
*   **Clinical Implication:** Essential for monitoring response to intravitreal steroids or anti-VEGF therapy.

#### 3. Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR)
*   **Appearance:** Dome-shaped elevation of the [[neurosensory retina]] from the RPE (neurosensory detachment).
*   **Pigment Epithelial Detachment (PED):** May see a smaller, dome-shaped elevation of the RPE layer itself beneath the neurosensory detachment.
*   **Fluid:** Optically clear (dark) subretinal fluid.

#### 4. Age-Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD)
*   **Dry ARMD:**
    *   **[[Drusen]]:** Visible as "bumps" or irregular elevations of the RPE layer (hyper-reflective nodules between RPE and Bruch's membrane).
    *   **Geographic Atrophy:** Severe disruption or absence of the RPE and external limiting membrane; increased signal penetration into the choroid due to RPE loss.
*   **Wet (Neovascular) ARMD:**
    *   Subretinal fluid (dark spaces).
    *   Intraretinal thickening/edema.
    *   **[[Choroidal Neovascular Membrane]] (CNVM):** Hyper-reflective lesion above or below the RPE.

#### 5. Diabetic Retinopathy (DME)
OCT classifies [[Diabetic Macular Edema]] (DME) to guide treatment:
*   **Spongy thickening:** Diffuse retinal thickening (>290 $\mu$m).
*   **Cystoid Macular Edema:** Intraretinal cysts.
*   **Neurosensory Detachment:** Subretinal fluid.
*   **Tractional DME:** Taut posterior hyaloid membrane pulling on the macula (Requires [[Pars Plana Vitrectomy]]).

### Clinical Applications: Glaucoma
OCT is crucial for the **pre-perimetric diagnosis** of glaucoma (detecting damage before visual field loss occurs).

1.  **[[Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer]] (RNFL) Analysis:**
    *   Measures the thickness of the RNFL around the optic disc.
    *   **TSNIT Curve:** Plots thickness (Temporal-Superior-Nasal-Inferior-Temporal).
    *   **Double Hump Pattern:** Normal RNFL is thickest superiorly and inferiorly. Loss of this "hump" indicates glaucomatous damage (ISNT rule violation).
2.  **Optic Nerve Head (ONH) Analysis:**
    *   Automated measurement of the **cup-to-disc ratio**.
    *   Neuroretinal rim area measurement.
3.  **Ganglion Cell Complex (GCC):**
    *   Measures the thickness of ganglion cell layers at the macula (early indicator of damage).

### Clinical Applications: Anterior Segment OCT (AS-OCT)
AS-OCT utilizes a longer wavelength (1310 nm) for deeper penetration through the sclera and limbus.

1.  **Angle Assessment:**
    *   Visualizes the **[[Anterior Chamber Angle]]**.
    *   Definitive documentation of appositional angle closure or open angles.
2.  **Corneal Imaging:**
    *   **[[Pachymetry]]:** Maps corneal thickness (useful for LASIK screening and keratoconus).
    *   **[[Keratoconus]]:** Detects thinning and ectasia.
3.  **Trabeculectomy Blebs:**
    *   Assesses the patency and morphology of filtering blebs after glaucoma surgery.
4.  **Tumors:**
    *   Delineates tumors and cysts of the [[iris]] and [[ciliary body]].

### Advantages and Limitations

**Advantages:**
*   **Non-contact:** No anesthesia required (unlike ultrasound).
*   **Resolution:** Extremely high (micron level), far superior to B-scan or MRI.
*   **Objective:** Provides quantitative data (thickness maps) for monitoring progression.

**Limitations:**
*   **Media Opacity:** Light cannot penetrate dense media. Poor images in presence of dense [[cataract]], [[vitreous hemorrhage]], or corneal opacity (unlike Ultrasound B-scan which penetrates these).
*   **Cost:** Equipment is expensive.
