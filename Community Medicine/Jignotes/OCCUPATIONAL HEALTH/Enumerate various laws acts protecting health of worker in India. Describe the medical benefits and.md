**Key Features of Medical Benefit:**
*   **Comprehensive Care:** There is **no ceiling on expenditure** on the treatment of an insured person.
*   **Coverage:** It covers sickness, employment injury, and maternity.
*   **Extension:** Medical care is also extended to the families of workers.

**Services Included in Medical Benefit:**
1.  **Out-patient care:** Ambulatory treatment.
2.  **Supply of drugs and dressings.**
3.  **Specialist services:** In all branches of medicine.
4.  **Diagnostic services:** Pathological and radiological investigations.
5.  **Domiciliary services:** Doctors visiting patients at home if necessary.
6.  **Maternal Care:** Antenatal, natal, and postnatal services.
7.  **[[Immunization]]** and Family Planning services.
8.  **Emergency services** and Ambulance services.

### Modes of Provision of Medical Benefit

The medical care under the ESI Scheme is delivered through two main systems:

#### 1. Direct Pattern (Service System)
In this system, the ESI Corporation or State Government directly sets up hospitals and dispensaries with full-time staff.
*   **Service Dispensaries:** Established in areas with a concentration of **1,000 or more** employee family units. These have full-time medical and paramedical personnel.
*   **Part-time ESI Dispensaries:** Established in areas where there are **less than 750** employee family units.
*   **Mobile Dispensaries:** Established for residential concentrations of employees scattered over long distances.

#### 2. Indirect Pattern (Panel System)
This is adopted in areas where ESI infrastructure (hospitals/dispensaries) is not available.
*   **[[Insurance Medical Practitioners]] (IMPs):** Private medical practitioners are registered and designated as IMPs to provide medical care.
*   **Clinics:** Treatment is provided at the clinics of these private practitioners.
*   **Remuneration:** IMPs are paid remuneration (capitation fee) quarterly based on the number of family units attached to them.

#### 3. Hospitalization and Specialist Care
*   **ESI Hospitals:** Dedicated hospitals built for ESI beneficiaries.
*   **Tie-up Arrangements:** For super-specialty treatment not available in ESI hospitals, patients are referred to advanced government or private empanelled medical institutions. The ESI Corporation bears the cost, even for treatment outside the state if necessary.
