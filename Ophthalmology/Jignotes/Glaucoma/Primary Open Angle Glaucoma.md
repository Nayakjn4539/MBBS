# [[Glaucoma]] > Primary Open Angle Glaucoma

# Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG)

### Definition and Overview
**[[Primary Open Angle Glaucoma]]** (POAG), also known as **Chronic Simple Glaucoma**, is a chronic, progressive [[optic neuropathy]] characterized by characteristic morphological changes at the [[optic nerve head]] and retinal nerve fiber layer, leading to specific visual field defects.
*   **Key Feature:** The angle of the [[anterior chamber]] is open and appears normal on [[gonioscopy]].
*   **Intraocular Pressure (IOP):** Often raised (>21 mmHg) but not invariably. IOP is a major risk factor but not part of the definition in modern classifications.
*   **Nature:** It is usually bilateral, asymmetrical, insidious in onset, and slowly progressive.
*   **Epidemiology:**
    *   Affects approximately 1 in 100 of the general population >40 years.
    *   Most common type of glaucoma in Caucasians and Africans.
    *   **Genetic Link:** Multifactorial inheritance. Specific genes linked include **[[Myocilin]] (MYOC/TIGR)**, **[[Optineurin]] (OPTN)**, and **WDR36**.

### Etiopathogenesis and Risk Factors
The exact cause is unknown, but resistance to aqueous outflow occurs at the level of the [[trabecular meshwork]] (specifically the juxtacanalicular meshwork).

**Risk Factors:**

| Category | Factors |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Demographic** | • **Age:** Prevalence rises with age (>40 years).<br>• **Race:** More common and severe in Blacks/African origin.<br>• **Family History:** Positive history in first-degree relatives (10% risk in siblings). |
| **Ocular** | • **High [[Intraocular Pressure]]:** Most significant risk factor.<br>• **[[Myopia]]:** High myopes are more predisposed.<br>• **[[Central Corneal Thickness]] (CCT):** Thin CCT (<555 µm) is an independent risk factor. |
| **Systemic** | • **[[Diabetes Mellitus]]:** Higher prevalence in diabetics.<br>• **Hypertension:** Affects optic nerve perfusion.<br>• **Cardiovascular Disease & Hypotension:** Nocturnal dips in BP can reduce perfusion pressure.<br>• **Cigarette Smoking.** |
| **Others** | • **Steroid Responsiveness:** High steroid responders are at greater risk. |

**Theories of Damage:**
1.  **Mechanical Theory:** Raised IOP causes mechanical stretching of the [[lamina cribrosa]], damaging axons.
2.  **Vascular/Ischemic Theory:** Reduced blood flow/perfusion to the optic nerve head causes ischemic death of retinal ganglion cells.

### Clinical Features
**Symptoms:**
POAG is frequently **asymptomatic** ("The Silent Thief of Sight") until significant visual field loss occurs.
*   Mild headache or eye ache.
*   **Frequent change in presbyopic glasses** (due to accommodation failure from pressure on ciliary muscle).
*   Delayed dark adaptation.
*   Significant visual loss (tubular vision) in end-stages.

**Signs:**
1.  **Anterior Segment:** Usually normal. Pupil reflex becomes sluggish in late stages.
2.  **Intraocular Pressure (IOP):**
    *   Usually >21 mmHg.
    *   **Diurnal Variation:** Exaggeration of normal diurnal variation (>5-8 mmHg fluctuation is diagnostic).
    *   **[[Ocular Hypertension]]:** Raised IOP without disc/field changes.
    *   **[[Normal Tension Glaucoma]]:** Normal IOP with glaucomatous disc/field changes.

### Optic Disc Changes (Glaucomatous Optic Atrophy)
Progressive loss of the **[[neuroretinal rim]]** (NRR) leads to pathological cupping. The NRR normally follows the **ISNT rule** (Inferior > Superior > Nasal > Temporal thickness). In glaucoma, this rule is violated (vertical thinning occurs first).

> Draw a normal optic disc vs. glaucomatous disc showing vertical cupping, bayonetting, and nasal shift**

*   **Vertical Cupping:** Cup:Disc (C:D) ratio >0.5 or asymmetry >0.2 between eyes.
*   **Laminar Dot Sign:** Visibility of pores in the lamina cribrosa due to loss of neural tissue.
*   **Bayonetting Sign:** Double angulation of blood vessels as they climb over the steep excavated rim.
*   **Nasal Shifting of Vessels:** Vessels are pushed nasally.
*   **Splinter Haemorrhages:** (Drance hemorrhage) at the disc margin; a sign of active progression.
*   **Peripapillary Atrophy:**
    *   **Beta Zone:** Inner zone of atrophy (sclera visible and choroidal vessels), specific for glaucoma.
    *   **Alpha Zone:** Outer zone of pigmentation (nonspecific).
*   **Baring of Circumlinear Vessels:** Space between the vessel and the cup margin due to rim loss.

### Visual Field Defects
Field defects correlate with optic disc changes and nerve fiber layer loss (Bjerrum's area).

**Sequence of Defects:**
1.  **Isopter Contraction:** Generalised constriction (earliest but non-specific).
2.  **Baring of the [[Blind Spot]]:** Exclusion of the blind spot from the central field (non-specific).
3.  **Paracentral Scotoma:** Small, wing-shaped scotoma in Bjerrum’s area (10°–25° from fixation); **Earliest clinically significant defect**.
4.  **Seidel’s Scotoma:** Paracentral scotoma joins the blind spot (sickle-shaped).
5.  **[[Arcuate Scotoma]] (Bjerrum’s Scotoma):** Extension of Seidel’s scotoma to arch over the fixation point and reach the horizontal raphe.
6.  **Ring/Double Arcuate Scotoma:** Superior and inferior arcuate scotomas join.
7.  **Roenne’s Central Nasal Step:** Created when two arcuate scotomas meet at the horizontal raphe but are unequal.
8.  **Tubular Vision:** Advanced loss leaving only a small central island.
9.  **Temporal Island:** The last area of vision to be lost.

### Diagnosis and Investigations
Diagnosis is based on the **Triad**: Raised IOP + Disc Changes + Field Defects.

| Investigation | Purpose | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Tonometry]]** | Measure IOP | **Goldmann Applanation Tonometer (GAT)** is the Gold Standard. |
| **[[Gonioscopy]]** | Evaluate Angle | Essential to distinguish POAG from Angle Closure. Shows open angle (Grade 3-4). |
| **[[Perimetry]]** | Assess Visual Fields | **Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA)** (Static) is standard. Monitors progression. |
| **[[Pachymetry]]** | Measure CCT | Thinner corneas give falsely low IOP readings; thicker corneas give falsely high readings. |
| **Disc Imaging** | Structural Analysis | **OCT** (RNFL thickness), CSLO (Heidelberg), Polarimetry (GDx). |
| **Provocative Tests** | Stress Test | Water Drinking Test (Rise >8mmHg is diagnostic) - rarely used now. |

> **Clinical Implication:** Always check Central Corneal Thickness (CCT). A thin cornea in a patient with "normal" IOP might mask true ocular hypertension or glaucoma.

### Management
The goal is to reach a **"Target Pressure"**—an IOP level where no further optic nerve damage occurs.

#### 1. Medical Management (Topical Drops)
This is usually the first line of treatment.

| Drug Class | Examples | Mechanism of Action | Side Effects/Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Prostaglandin Analogues]]** (First Line) | **Latanoprost**, Bimatoprost, Travoprost | Increase **Uveoscleral Outflow** | Iris hyperpigmentation, trichosis (long lashes), cystoid macular edema (CME). |
| **[[Beta Blockers]]** | **Timolol**, Betaxolol (selective) | Decrease **Aqueous Production** | Bronchospasm (asthma), bradycardia, heart block. Betaxolol is safer for asthmatics. |
| **Alpha-2 Agonists** | **Brimonidine**, Apraclonidine | Decrease Production + Increase Uveoscleral Outflow (Dual Action) | CNS depression (drowsiness) - **Contraindicated in children**, lid retraction, allergic conjunctivitis. |
| **[[Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors]]** | Dorzolamide (Topical), Acetazolamide (Oral) | Decrease **Aqueous Production** | Bitter taste, sulfa allergy, corneal endothelial damage. |
| **Rho Kinase Inhibitors** | **Netarsudil** | Increase **Trabecular Outflow** | Conjunctival hyperemia. |
| **Miotics** | Pilocarpine | Increase **Trabecular Outflow** | Ciliary spasm, myopia, retinal detachment. Rarely used for POAG now. |

> **Mnemonic for Brimonidine Side Effects:** "ABC" - **A**pnea, **B**radycardia, **C**NS depression (Contraindicated in children).

#### 2. Laser Therapy
*   **Argon Laser Trabeculoplasty (ALT):** Burns to the trabecular meshwork to cause shrinkage and opening of spaces. Effective in ~75-85% of cases initially.
*   **Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT):** Uses frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser. Targets pigmented cells, causing less damage than ALT. Repeatable.

#### 3. Surgical Management
Indicated when medical/laser therapy fails (Target IOP not reached) or compliance is poor.
*   **[[Trabeculectomy]]:** Gold standard filtration surgery. Creates a fistula (guarded by a scleral flap) for aqueous to drain into the subconjunctival space (bleb).
    *   **Antimetabolites:** **Mitomycin C (MMC)** or **5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)** are used to prevent fibrosis and bleb failure.
*   **Deep Sclerectomy / Viscocanalostomy:** Non-penetrating surgeries (safer but technically difficult).
*   **Glaucoma Drainage Devices (Setons/Tube Shunts):** **Ahmed Glaucoma Valve**, Molteno implant. Used for refractory glaucoma.
*   **MIGS (Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgery):** iStent, XEN gel stent. Less invasive, modest IOP lowering.
