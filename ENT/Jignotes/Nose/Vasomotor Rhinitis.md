# Vasomotor Rhinitis

**Vasomotor Rhinitis** (VMR) is a form of chronic, non-allergic rhinitis characterized by symptoms of nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea resulting from an imbalance in the autonomic nerve supply to the nasal mucosa. It is essentially a diagnosis of exclusion where allergic and infective causes are ruled out.

It is also known as **Idiopathic Rhinitis**, **Intrinsic Rhinitis**, or **Non-allergic Non-infectious Perennial Rhinitis (NANIPER)**.

### Pathophysiology
The core mechanism involves an instability of the [[Autonomic Nervous System]] supplying the nasal mucosa. The nasal mucosa is rich in venous sinusoids (erectile tissue) controlled by smooth muscle sphincters.

*   **Normal Physiology:**
    *   **Sympathetic stimulation:** Causes vasoconstriction and shrinkage of mucosa (Decongestion).
    *   **Parasympathetic stimulation:** Causes vasodilation (Congestion/Edema) and hypersecretion from nasal glands (Rhinorrhea).
*   **Pathology in VMR:**
    *   There is **Parasympathetic Overactivity** or **Sympathetic Hypoactivity**.
    *   The nasal mucosa becomes hyper-reactive to non-specific stimuli (e.g., temperature changes, dust, smoke).
    *   This leads to excessive vasodilation, engorgement of turbinates, and profuse watery secretion.

### Etiology and Precipitating Factors
The condition is multifactorial.

**1. Predisposing Factors:**
*   **Age:** Common in younger age groups or middle age.
*   **Sex:** More common in women.
*   **Heredity:** Genetic predisposition.
*   **Psychological:** Anxiety, tension, and stress play a significant role as the autonomic system is controlled by the hypothalamus.
*   **Endocrine:** Hypothyroidism, puberty, menstruation, pregnancy.
*   **Drugs:** Antihypertensives (Reserpine, Beta-blockers).
*   **Anatomical:** [[Deviated Nasal Septum]].

**2. Precipitating Factors (Triggers):**
*   Sudden changes in temperature or humidity.
*   Blast of cold air.
*   Dust, smoke, or strong odors (perfumes).
*   Alcohol.
*   Spicy food (**Gustatory Rhinitis**).
*   Emotional stress.

### Clinical Features
Symptoms are perennial (persist throughout the year) and often mimic [[Allergic Rhinitis]]. Patients are often categorized into two groups:

1.  **"Runners" (Wet Type):** Predominant symptom is profuse, watery **rhinorrhea**.
2.  **"Blockers" (Dry Type):** Predominant symptom is **nasal congestion/obstruction**.

**Common Symptoms:**
*   **Paroxysmal Sneezing:** Often occurs immediately after getting out of bed in the morning.
*   **Rhinorrhea:** Profuse and watery; may drip when leaning forward.
*   **Nasal Obstruction:**
    *   Usually **alternating** from side to side.
    *   Worse at night.
    *   Affects the dependent side (side the patient is lying on) due to venous pooling.
*   **Post-nasal Drip:** Common.
*   **Hyposmia:** Can occur intermittently.

### Clinical Examination (Signs)
*   **Anterior Rhinoscopy:**
    *   **Mucosa:** Usually **congested and hypertrophic** (deep red). This is a key differentiator from allergic rhinitis where mucosa is pale/boggy. However, sometimes it may appear normal.
    *   **Turbinates:** Hypertrophied, especially the [[Inferior Turbinate]].
*   **Posterior Rhinoscopy:**
    *   May show **Mulberry Hypertrophy** of the posterior end of the inferior turbinate.

### Diagnostic Evaluation
Diagnosis is primarily by **exclusion** of allergy and infection.

*   **History:** Absence of specific allergen exposure history.
*   **Skin Prick Test/Intradermal Test:** Negative.
*   **IgE Levels (RAST):** Normal.
*   **Nasal Smear:** Does *not* show eosinophilia (distinguishes from [[Allergic Rhinitis]] and NARES).
*   **Nasal Endoscopy:** To rule out polyps or structural abnormalities.

### Differential Diagnosis: Allergic vs. Vasomotor Rhinitis

| Feature | Allergic Rhinitis | Vasomotor Rhinitis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mechanism** | Immunologic (IgE mediated) | Autonomic Imbalance |
| **History** | Family history of allergy (+) | History of stress/emotion (+) |
| **Trigger** | Specific Allergen (Pollen, dust) | Non-specific (Temp, humidity, smoke) |
| **Symptoms** | Itching (nose/eyes), Sneezing | Nasal block, Rhinorrhea (alternating) |
| **Eye Symptoms** | Common (Watering, itching) | Rare |
| **Nasal Mucosa** | **Pale, Boggy, bluish** | **Congested, Red, Hypertrophic** |
| **IgE Levels** | Elevated | Normal |
| **Skin Tests** | Positive | Negative |
| **Nasal Smear** | Eosinophils present | Eosinophils absent |

### Complications
Long-standing vasomotor rhinitis may lead to:
*   [[Nasal Polyps]].
*   **Hypertrophic Rhinitis** (irreversible fibrosis of turbinates).
*   [[Chronic Sinusitis]] (due to obstruction of osteomeatal complex).

### Management

#### A. Medical Management
The goal is symptomatic relief and avoidance of triggers.

1.  **Avoidance:** Avoid sudden temperature changes, blasts of air, dust, and smoke.
2.  **Antihistamines:** Useful for sneezing and rhinorrhea.
3.  **Oral Decongestants:** E.g., Phenylephrine, Pseudoephedrine. Used for nasal obstruction.
4.  **Topical Steroids:** E.g., Beclomethasone, Budesonide, Fluticasone. Very effective in controlling symptoms; reduces nasal hyper-reactivity.
5.  **Anticholinergics:** **Ipratropium Bromide** nasal spray is specifically useful for controlling watery rhinorrhea (runners).
6.  **Systemic Steroids:** Short course for severe, refractory cases.
7.  **Psychological Counseling:** Reassurance and tranquilizers if stress is a major factor.

> **Clinical Implication:** Prolonged use of topical decongestants (e.g., Xylometazoline) should be avoided to prevent **Rhinitis Medicamentosa** (rebound congestion).

#### B. Surgical Management
Indicated when medical treatment fails.

1.  **Turbinate Reduction Surgery:** For "Blockers" (Nasal Obstruction).
    *   Submucosal diathermy.
    *   Cryosurgery.
    *   Laser turbinoplasty.
    *   Partial [[Turbinectomy]].
    *   Submucous resection of turbinate bone.

2.  **Vidian Neurectomy:** For "Runners" (Intractable Rhinorrhea).
    *   Involves sectioning the **Vidian nerve** (Nerve of Pterygoid Canal) which carries preganglionic parasympathetic secretomotor fibers to the nose.
    *   This reduces excessive secretion.
    *   Can be done via transantral or endoscopic approach.

### Summary Mnemonic
**V.M.R.**
*   **V**asomotor instability (Parasympathetic > Sympathetic).
*   **M**ucosa is congested (Red, not pale).
*   **R**hinorrhea and alternating block.
