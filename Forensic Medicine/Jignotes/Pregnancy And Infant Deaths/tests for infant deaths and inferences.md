# [[Pregnancy And Infant Deaths]] > tests for infant deaths and inferences

The determination of whether a child was born alive ([[Live birth]]) or dead ([[Dead born]]) is the most crucial question in cases of alleged [[Infanticide]]. This assessment relies on a series of tests primarily focused on the changes in the lungs and other organs due to respiration.

### 1. Hydrostatic Test (Raygat’s Test)
This is the most important and widely used test to determine live birth. It relies on the principle that unrespired lungs have a specific gravity (1.04-1.05) higher than water, while respired lungs (specific gravity 0.94) become lighter due to air entry and float.

**Procedure:**
1.  **En-bloc Removal:** The lungs are removed along with the heart, thymus, and trachea (the "pluck") carefully to avoid tearing.
2.  **Step 1:** The entire mass is placed in a bucket of water. Note if it floats or sinks.
3.  **Step 2:** The individual lungs are separated and placed in water. Note buoyancy.
4.  **Step 3:** Each lung is cut into small pieces (lobules). These pieces are placed in water.
5.  **Step 4 (Confirmatory):** The floating pieces are taken out, wrapped in a cloth or placed between two wooden boards, and squeezed firmly to expel decomposition gases or artificial air. They are then placed back in water.

**Inference:**
*   **Positive (+ve):** If the pieces **float even after squeezing**, it indicates **residual air** in the alveoli, confirming respiration and [[Live birth]].
*   **Negative (-ve):** If the pieces sink, it suggests the child was [[Dead born]] (or the test is false negative).

**Fallacies of Hydrostatic Test:**

| False Positive (Floats but Dead Born) | False Negative (Sinks but Live Born) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Artificial Respiration:** Air forced into lungs mechanically. | **Atelectasis:** Primary (failure to expand) or Secondary (collapse). |
| **Putrefaction:** Decomposition gases ($H_2S$, $CO_2$, $CH_4$) in tissues. | **Pneumonia/Edema:** Consolidation increases density. |
| **Emphysema:** Putrefactive gases. | **Hyaline Membrane Disease:** Prevents expansion. |
| **Frozen Lungs:** Ice is lighter than water. | **Vagitus Uterinus:** Breathing while still in the uterus/vagina. |

### 2. Static Test (Fodere’s Test)
This test is based on the absolute weight of the lungs. Respiration causes an increase in pulmonary blood flow (pulmonary circulation opens up), increasing the weight of the lungs.

*   **Dead born/Unrespired:** approx. 30–40 gm.
*   **Live born/Respired:** approx. 60–70 gm (Weight doubles).
*   **Inference:** Significant increase in weight suggests live birth, but this is not reliable as weight varies with the size of the infant.

### 3. Ploucquet’s Test
This test compares the weight of the lungs to the total body weight.
*   **Formula:** $\frac{\text{Weight of Lungs}}{\text{Body Weight}}$
*   **Dead born:** Ratio is roughly **1:70**.
*   **Live born:** Ratio is roughly **1:35**.
*   **Inference:** A ratio near 1:35 suggests respiration.
*   *Note:* This test is now considered unreliable and obsolete because body weight varies significantly due to nutrition, putrefaction, or dehydration.

### 4. Breslau’s Second Life Test (Stomach-Bowel Test)
This test relies on the swallowing of air (aerophagia) which accompanies respiration. Air enters the stomach and travels down the intestines.

**Procedure:**
Ligatures are applied at the cardiac end of the stomach, the pyloric end, and various segments of the intestines. The entire GIT is removed and placed in water.

**Inference:**
*   **Floats:** Suggests air has been swallowed (Live birth).
*   **Sinks:** No air swallowed (Dead born).
*   *Progression of Air:*
    *   Stomach: 10–15 minutes after birth.
    *   Small Intestine: 6–12 hours.
    *   Large Intestine: 12–24 hours.

**False Positives:** Decomposition gases (putrefaction), artificial respiration forcing air into the stomach.

### 5. Wreden’s Test (Middle Ear Test)
In a fetus (dead born), the middle ear contains a gelatinous plug of embryonic connective tissue. In a live born infant, respiration allows air to enter the middle ear through the [[Eustachian tube]].

**Procedure:**
Under water, the tegmen tympani (roof of the middle ear) is removed or the tympanic membrane is punctured.

**Inference:**
*   **Air bubbles escape:** Indicates [[Live birth]].
*   **Gelatinous plug present:** Indicates [[Dead born]].

### 6. Histological Examination (Microscopy)
This is the most reliable method to confirm lung expansion.

| Feature | Unrespired Lung (Dead born) | Respired Lung (Live born) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Appearance** | Glandular, solid, liver-like. | Expanded, spongy. |
| **Alveoli** | Collapsed, slit-like. | Distended, round/oval. |
| **Epithelium** | Cuboidal/Columnar. | Flattened Squamous. |
| **Elastic Fibers** | Unstretched, irregular. | Stretched over alveoli (Taut). |
| **Blood Vessels** | Minimal blood. | Dilated and engorged. |

### Medico-legal Aspects & Autopsy Findings
*   **External Signs of Live Birth:**
    *   **Chest shape:** Flat in dead born; arched/drum-shaped in live born.
    *   **Diaphragm Level:** At 3rd/4th rib in dead born; descends to 6th/7th rib in live born due to lung expansion.
    *   **Umbilical Cord:** Signs of vital reaction (redness, separation ring) indicate survival for at least 24-48 hours. [[Umbilical cord]] mummification starts after 24 hours.
    *   **Skin:** Exfoliation starts after 24 hours.
*   **Cause of Death:** In [[Infanticide]], look for signs of smothering, strangulation, or head injuries. In dead born, look for maceration (skin slipping, aseptic autolysis) which indicates intrauterine death.
