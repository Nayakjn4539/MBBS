# [[Special Injuries]] > Scalds

### Definition and Causation
[[Scalds]] are thermal injuries produced by the application of **moist heat** to the body. This includes:
*   Liquids at temperatures generally above 60°C (e.g., boiling water, oil, tar).
*   Steam (which causes severe damage due to latent heat).

### Characteristics of Scalds
The appearance of a scald differs significantly from dry flame burns. The key features are:

1.  **Skin Appearance:**
    *   **Redness (Erythema):** Appears immediately due to vasoparalysis.
    *   **Blisters (Vesication):** Occur within a few minutes. If the blistered skin is removed, it leaves a **pink, raw surface** which later becomes brownish, hard, and dry.
    *   **Soddening:** The skin appears **bleached** (dirty white) and **sodden** (boggy/soft).
2.  **Hair:**
    *   **Singeing is absent.** The hair follicles are usually preserved unless the scalding is deep and necrotic. The hair is not charred.
3.  **Clothing:**
    *   Clothes are usually **wet** but **not burnt** or scorched.
4.  **Distribution:**
    *   **Splash Marks:** If caused by splashing, the injury may appear as scattered, discrete droplets or patches.
    *   **Trickle Marks:** Streaks of liquid running downwards from the main area cause linear blistering (lines of flow), indicating the position of the victim at the time of injury.

### Classification (Degrees of Scalds)
Similar to burns, scalds are classified into three degrees based on tissue depth:
1.  **First Degree:** Erythema (redness) without blistering.
2.  **Second Degree:** Blister formation (vesicles) over the scalded area.
3.  **Third Degree:** Necrosis of the dermis (rare in water scalds unless immersion is prolonged or liquid is superheated oil/tar).

### Mnemonic for Scalds
**"STEAM"**
*   **S** - Sodden/Bleached skin
*   **T** - Trickle marks (lines of flow)
*   **E** - Erythema and Blisters
*   **A** - Absence of Charring/Singeing
*   **M** - Moist heat causation

### Comparison: Burns vs. Scalds
This is a high-yield exam topic. [[Differentiation of Burns and Scalds]]

| Feature | Dry Flame Burns | Scalds (Moist Heat) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Causative Agent** | Flame, hot solid objects | Hot liquids, steam |
| **Hair** | **Singed**, charred, bulb-like swelling | **Not singed**, hair usually intact |
| **Skin Appearance** | Charred, roasted, dry, black/brown | Sodden, bleached, dirty white, wet |
| **Blisters** | Present at periphery of burnt area | Present **over** the scalded area |
| **Clothing** | Burnt, charred | Wet, sodden, not burnt |
| **Soot/Carbon** | Present in folds and airways | **Absent** |
| **Splashing** | Absent | Present (Trickle marks) |
| **Healing** | Contractures common (deep scarring) | Scar is thinner, less contraction |

### Medicolegal Aspects
1.  **Accidental:** This is the **most common** manner.
    *   Usually seen in children (pulling vessels of boiling water from stoves) or industrial workers (steam pipes bursting).
    *   Epileptics may fall into hot liquids during a seizure.
2.  **Homicidal:**
    *   Deliberate throwing of boiling water or acid (though acid is technically a chemical burn, it is often thrown in liquid form).
    *   **Child Abuse:** Forced immersion of children in hot water (see below).
3.  **Suicidal:** Rare. Occasionally seen if a person jumps into a vat of boiling liquid.

### Special Forms of Scalding

#### 1. Immersion Scalds (Dipping)
This is highly indicative of **Child Abuse** or [[Battered Baby Syndrome]].
*   **Mechanism:** Forced immersion of a child's limbs or buttocks into hot water.
*   **Findings:**
    *   **Glove and Stocking distribution:** Sharp, clear-cut line of demarcation between scalded and normal skin on hands or feet.
    *   **Doughnut Sign:** If the buttocks are pressed against the bottom of a tub/bath, the central area is spared (due to contact with the cooler tub surface), surrounded by a ring of scalding.
    *   **Zebra Lines:** Skin folds (e.g., inguinal) are spared, creating striped patterns.
    *   Absence of splash marks suggests the victim was held still (force).

#### 2. Steam Burns
*   Caused by superheated steam.
*   The skin appears dirty white and sodden.
*   **Inhalation:** Steam can be inhaled, causing severe **laryngeal edema** (glottis edema), resulting in asphyxia and rapid death. The mucosa of the respiratory tract may appear white/bronzed.

### Autopsy Findings
*   **External:**
    *   Presence of blisters containing serous fluid (rich in protein and chlorides).
    *   Red line of demarcation (vital reaction) indicates antemortem nature.
    *   No soot or carbon particles on the body.
*   **Internal:**
    *   Respiratory passages are usually healthy *unless* steam was inhaled.
    *   If steam inhalation occurred: Mucosa of larynx/trachea is congested, edematous, or necrotic.
    *   Visceral congestion due to shock.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a forearm showing "Glove and Stocking" anesthesia vs "Glove and Stocking" scalding to differentiate. Also, a diagram of the "Doughnut Sign" on buttocks for child abuse is helpful.
