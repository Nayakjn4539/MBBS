# [[General Orthopaedics]] > Traction

### Definition and Principles
[[Traction]] is the application of a pulling force to a part of the body to provide reduction, alignment, and immobilization of fractures or to relieve muscle spasm. It relies on the principle of **Counter-traction**; for every action, there must be an equal and opposite reaction. Without counter-traction, the patient would simply be dragged towards the pulley. Counter-traction is usually provided by the patient's body weight (by elevating the foot end of the bed) or by a fixed appliance (e.g., the ring of a Thomas splint).

**Aims of Traction:**
*   **Reduction:** To bring fracture fragments into alignment.
*   **Immobilization:** To maintain the reduction and prevent soft tissue damage.
*   **Muscle Spasm Relief:** To overcome the spasm of strong muscles surrounding the bone (e.g., thigh muscles in femoral fractures).
*   **Deformity Correction:** To gradually correct deformities (e.g., in [[Hip dysplasia]] or [[TB spine]]).
*   **Joint Distraction:** To relieve pain in conditions like [[Osteoarthritis]] or [[Infection]].

### Classification of Traction
Traction is broadly classified based on the method of application and the mechanism of force.

#### 1. Based on Method of Application
*   **[[Skin Traction]]:** Applied to the skin using adhesive or non-adhesive straps. The force is transmitted to the bone via the skin and soft tissues.
*   **[[Skeletal Traction]]:** Applied directly to the bone using pins (Steinmann) or wires (Kirschner).

#### 2. Based on Mechanism
*   **Fixed Traction:** The traction force is applied against a fixed point on the patient's body.
    *   *Example:* In a [[Thomas splint]], the traction cords are tied to the distal end of the splint, and the counter-traction is provided by the ring of the splint pressing against the [[Ischial tuberosity]].
*   **Sliding (Balanced) Traction:** The weight of the traction is hung over a pulley, and the patient's body weight acts as counter-traction.
    *   *Example:* Weight hanging over the foot end of the bed with the bed elevated. The patient can move slightly without disturbing the fracture alignment.

### Skin Traction
This is a non-invasive method suitable for short-term management or for children.

**Indications:**
*   Temporary management of [[Hip fractures]] or [[Femoral shaft fractures]] awaiting surgery.
*   [[Pediatric fractures]] (e.g., Gallows traction).
*   Correction of deformities (mild).
*   Relief of muscle spasm in back pain (Pelvic traction).

**Method:**
*   Adhesive or non-adhesive straps are applied to the sides of the limb.
*   A spreader block is used distally to prevent pressure on the [[Malleoli]].
*   Crepe bandage secures the straps.

**Limitations and Complications:**
*   **Weight Limit:** Maximum weight is **4–5 kg** (roughly 10% of body weight). Excessive weight causes the traction to slide off or damage the skin.
*   **Skin Damage:** Allergies to adhesive, excoriation, or pressure necrosis.
*   **Nerve Palsy:** Tight bandaging around the fibular neck can compress the [[Common peroneal nerve]], leading to [[Foot drop]].
*   **Circulatory Compromise:** Tight bandaging can act as a tourniquet.

**Clinical Implication:** Always check the neurovascular status of the toes/fingers and the skin condition daily. Avoid in patients with skin abrasions, extensive soft tissue injury, or varicose ulcers.

### Skeletal Traction
This involves inserting a metal pin or wire through the bone to apply force directly. It is used when a greater pulling force is required for a longer duration.

**Indications:**
*   Adult [[Femoral shaft fractures]].
*   [[Tibial fractures]] (unstable).
*   Cervical spine injuries (Skull traction).
*   When skin traction is contraindicated (e.g., skin wounds).
*   When heavy weights (>5 kg) are needed (up to 15-20 kg).

**Common Sites for Pin Insertion:**
1.  **Upper Tibia:** Most common site. Inserted 2 cm distal and 2 cm posterior to the [[Tibial tuberosity]].
    *   *Caution:* Must avoid the growth plate in children and the [[Common peroneal nerve]] laterally. Always drill from **Lateral to Medial** to avoid hitting the nerve on the exit side.
2.  **Lower Femur:** Supracondylar region. Used for femoral and pelvic fractures.
3.  **Calcaneum:** For tibial fractures. Inserted 2 cm below and behind the lateral malleolus.
4.  **Olecranon:** For supracondylar humerus or humeral shaft fractures.
5.  **Skull:** Using Crutchfield tongs or Gardner-Wells tongs for cervical spine dislocation.

**Instruments Used:**
*   **[[Steinmann Pin]]:** Thick, rigid stainless steel pin.
*   **[[Denham Pin]]:** Similar to Steinmann but has a threaded central portion to engage the bony cortex. This reduces the risk of the pin sliding laterally or medially (which can cause infection). Useful in [[Osteoporosis]] or cancellous bone (like calcaneum).
*   **[[Kirschner Wire]] (K-wire):** Thinner wire, usually requires a tensioner (horseshoe clamp) to prevent bending.
*   **[[Bohler's Stirrup]]:** A U-shaped clamp that attaches to the pin to allow the traction rope to be connected.

**Procedure:**
1.  Local anesthesia (skin and periosteum).
2.  Strict aseptic technique.
3.  Insert pin perpendicular to the long axis of the bone.
4.  Attach stirrup and weights.

**Complications:**
*   **Pin Tract Infection:** Most common. Can lead to [[Osteomyelitis]].
*   **Neurovascular Injury:** Iatrogenic damage during insertion (e.g., common peroneal nerve or saphenous nerve).
*   **Distraction:** Excessive weight can pull fracture fragments apart, leading to [[Non-union]].
*   **Physeal Injury:** In children, if placed through the growth plate.
*   **Ligament Laxity:** Prolonged traction across a joint (e.g., knee ligaments in upper tibial traction).

### Specific Types of Traction (Named Methods)

#### 1. Gallows Traction (Bryant’s Traction)
*   **Indication:** Fracture shaft of the femur in children **< 2 years** or weighing **< 12 kg**.
*   **Mechanism:** Both legs are strapped and pulled vertically upwards so that the buttocks are just lifted off the bed. The body weight acts as counter-traction.
*   **Risk:** Vascular compromise (Volkmann's ischemia) of the legs due to gravity draining blood and tight bandages. Daily toe vascular checks are mandatory.

#### 2. Buck’s Extension
*   **Indication:** Temporary skin traction for hip fractures, knee injuries, or back pain.
*   **Mechanism:** Simple longitudinal skin traction with the leg extended. No sling is used under the knee.

#### 3. Russell’s Traction
*   **Indication:** Femoral fractures, hip pathology.
*   **Mechanism:** A form of skin traction where a sling is placed under the knee to exert a vertical force, while longitudinal traction is applied to the leg. The resultant force aligns the femur. It is a "balanced" traction.

#### 4. Dunlop’s Traction
*   **Indication:** [[Supracondylar fracture of humerus]] (unstable/comminuted) or difficult elbow fractures.
*   **Mechanism:** Skin traction applied to the forearm with the elbow flexed at 90 degrees and the arm abducted.

#### 5. 90-90 Traction
*   **Indication:** Subtrochanteric or proximal femoral fractures in older children/young adults.
*   **Mechanism:** Skeletal traction through the distal femur; hip and knee are both flexed to 90 degrees to relax the iliopsoas and hamstrings.

#### 6. Skull Traction
*   **Indication:** Cervical spine fractures or dislocations.
*   **Instrument:** Crutchfield tongs or Gardner-Wells tongs inserted into the outer table of the skull (parietal region).

### General Care of Patient on Traction
*   **Circulation:** Check pulses, capillary refill, color, and temperature of distal extremities.
*   **Nerve Function:** Check sensation and movement (especially dorsiflexion of toes to test common peroneal nerve).
*   **Skin Care:** Check for pressure sores (heels, sacrum, elbows).
*   **Pin Site Care:** Regular dressing with antiseptics to prevent infection.
*   **Alignment:** Ensure the line of pull remains correct and weights hang freely (not touching the floor).
*   **Exercise:** Active static exercises (quadriceps drill) and movement of uninvolved joints to prevent DVT and stiffness.

**Mnemonic for Traction Care: TRACTION**
*   **T** - Temperature (extremity infection)
*   **R** - Ropes hang freely
*   **A** - Alignment
*   **C** - Circulation check (5 P's)
*   **T** - Type and location of fracture
*   **I** - Increase fluid intake
*   **O** - Overhead trapeze (for patient mobility)
*   **N** - No weights on bed or floor
