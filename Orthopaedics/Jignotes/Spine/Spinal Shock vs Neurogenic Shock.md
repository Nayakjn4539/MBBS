# [[Spine]] > Spinal Shock vs Neurogenic Shock

### Spinal Shock vs. Neurogenic Shock

In the context of [[spinal cord injury]] (SCI), it is critical to distinguish between **Spinal Shock** and **Neurogenic Shock**. While they often coexist in severe high-level injuries, they represent two distinct physiological phenomena: one is a **neurological** state, and the other is a **hemodynamic** state.

---

### 1. Spinal Shock
**Definition:** A transient physiological state of complete cessation of all spinal cord functions (motor, sensory, autonomic, and reflex activity) below the level of the injury immediately following trauma. It is essentially a "concussion" of the spinal cord.

*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   Sudden disruption of supraspinal facilitation leads to hyperpolarization of neurons.
    *   Results in a temporary "shutdown" of synaptic transmission.
*   **Clinical Presentation:**
    *   **Flaccid Paralysis:** Loss of motor tone and power below the lesion.
    *   **Anesthesia:** Complete sensory loss below the lesion.
    *   **Areflexia:** Absence of deep tendon reflexes and superficial reflexes.
    *   **Visceral Paralysis:** Urinary retention (atonic bladder) and paralytic ileus (constipation).
    *   **Anal Sphincter:** Flaccid anal tone.
*   **Duration:**
    *   Variable; typically lasts 24–48 hours but can persist for days to weeks,.
*   **Resolution (End of Spinal Shock):**
    *   The return of the [[bulbocavernosus reflex]] usually marks the termination of spinal shock.
    *   As spinal shock wears off, **flaccidity is replaced by spasticity** (hypertonia and hyperreflexia) characteristic of an [[Upper Motor Neuron lesion]] (UMN).

### 2. Neurogenic Shock
**Definition:** A hemodynamic syndrome resulting from the loss of sympathetic autonomic tone, leading to widespread vasodilation and bradycardia. It is a form of **distributive shock**.

*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   Occurs in injuries **above T6** (where sympathetic outflow exits),.
    *   **Disruption of Sympathetic Outflow:** Causes loss of vasomotor tone $\rightarrow$ peripheral pooling of blood $\rightarrow$ hypotension.
    *   **Unopposed Vagal Tone:** The parasympathetic system (Vagus nerve) remains intact and unopposed $\rightarrow$ significant **bradycardia**.
*   **Clinical Presentation:**
    *   **Hypotension:** Systolic BP often < 90 mmHg (due to vasodilation).
    *   **Bradycardia:** Heart rate < 60 bpm (distinct from hemorrhagic shock where tachycardia is seen),.
    *   **Warm, Dry Skin:** Due to peripheral vasodilation (unlike the cold, clammy skin of hypovolemic shock).
    *   **Priapism:** May be present due to vasodilation.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Fluids:** Judicious IV fluids (crystalloids) to restore volume, but avoid overload.
    *   **Vasopressors:** Drugs like **Dopamine** or **Norepinephrine** are often required to maintain vascular tone and heart rate.
    *   **Atropine:** May be needed for severe bradycardia.

### 3. Comparison: Spinal Shock vs. Neurogenic Shock

| Feature | [[Spinal Shock]] | [[Neurogenic Shock]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nature of Problem** | **Neurological** phenomenon (Functional loss). | **Hemodynamic** phenomenon (Circulatory collapse). |
| **Primary Defect** | Loss of motor, sensory, and reflex activity below injury. | Loss of sympathetic outflow (Vasomotor tone). |
| **Mechanism** | Potassium channel changes/neuronal hyperpolarization. | Autonomic dysregulation (Sympathetic loss, Parasympathetic dominance). |
| **Level of Injury** | Can occur at **any level** of the spinal cord. | Typically occurs with injuries at **T6 or above**. |
| **Vital Signs** | BP and HR are generally stable (unless associated with neurogenic shock). | **Hypotension** and **Bradycardia** are classic signs. |
| **Clinical Signs** | Flaccid paralysis, Areflexia, Anesthesia. | Warm dry skin, low BP, slow pulse. |
| **Bulbocavernosus Reflex**| **Absent** initially. Its return marks the end of spinal shock. | Variable; not the defining feature. |
| **Duration** | Transient (Days to Weeks). | Transient (usually resolves in 1–3 weeks as vascular tone returns). |
| **Outcome** | Evolves into Spasticity (UMN signs). | Hemodynamic stability returns. |

### 4. Clinical Implications

*   **Fluid Resuscitation Pitfall:** Do not mistake Neurogenic Shock for [[Hypovolemic Shock]]. In hypovolemic shock (blood loss), the body compensates with *tachycardia* and *vasoconstriction* (cold skin). In neurogenic shock, there is *bradycardia* and *vasodilation* (warm skin). Aggressive fluids in neurogenic shock can lead to pulmonary edema; **vasopressors** are often the better choice,.
*   **Prognostication:** Spinal shock makes it impossible to determine if a lesion is Complete or Incomplete immediately after injury. One cannot diagnose a "Complete Cord Transection" until spinal shock has resolved (return of [[bulbocavernosus reflex]]).
*   **Sacral Sparing:** During the assessment, always check for "sacral sparing" (perianal sensation, toe flexion). Its presence indicates an **incomplete** injury and a better prognosis, but this can only be accurately assessed after spinal shock clears.

### Mnemonic
*   **Spinal** Shock = **S**talled **S**pinal cord (The cord is "stunned" - Flaccid, No reflexes).
*   **N**eurogenic Shock = **N**o **N**orepinephrine effect (Loss of sympathetic tone - Low BP, Low HR).
