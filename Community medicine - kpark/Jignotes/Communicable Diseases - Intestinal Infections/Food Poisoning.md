# Food Poisoning

**Definition**
Food poisoning is an acute gastroenteritis caused by the ingestion of food or drink contaminated with either living bacteria or their toxins, or inorganic chemical substances and poisons derived from plants and animals. It is characterized by:
1.  History of ingestion of a common food.
2.  Attack of many persons at the same time.
3.  Similarity of signs and symptoms in the majority of cases [[epidemic]].,

### Classification
1.  **Non-bacterial:** Chemical poisoning (fertilizers, pesticides, heavy metals), Mushroom poisoning (Amanita phylloides), Solanine (sprouting potatoes).
2.  **Bacterial:**
    *   **Infective:** Multiplication of organisms in the host (e.g., [[Salmonella]]).
    *   **Toxic:** Ingestion of preformed toxin (e.g., [[Staphylococcus aureus]], [[Clostridium botulinum]]).

### Important Bacterial Food Poisoning Types (Comparative Table)

| Feature | **Salmonella** | **Staphylococcal** | **Botulism** | **Cl. perfringens** | **Bacillus cereus** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Agent** | *S. typhimurium*, *S. enteritidis* | *Staph. aureus* (Enterotoxin) | *Cl. botulinum* (Exotoxin A, B, E) | *Cl. perfringens* | *B. cereus* |
| **Source** | Meat, milk, poultry, eggs, rodents | Milk products, salads, custard, skin/nasal carriers | Canned foods (home preserved), smoked fish | Reheated meat/poultry, precooked foods | Fried Rice (Chinese food), dried foods |
| **Mechanism** | Multiplication in intestine (Infection) | **Preformed** heat-stable toxin | **Preformed** neurotoxin | Spores survive cooking, multiply in gut | Emetic (Preformed toxin) / Diarrheal (In vivo) |
| **Incubation Period** | **12 – 24 hours** (Range: 6-72 hrs) | **1 – 6 hours** (Very Short) | **18 – 36 hours** (12-36 hrs) | **6 – 24 hours** (Peak 10-14 hrs) | 1-6 hrs (Emetic)<br>12-24 hrs (Diarrheal) |
| **Clinical Features** | **Fever**, diarrhea, vomiting, chills | **Vomiting** (sudden), cramps, **No Fever** | **Neuro symptoms:** Diplopia, dysphagia, dysarthria, muscle weakness | Diarrhea, cramps, **No vomiting**, **No fever** | Vomiting (Emetic)<br>Diarrhea (Diarrheal) |
| **Prognosis** | Low mortality (1%) | Rapid recovery (24 hrs) | **High Mortality** (Resp. failure) | Rapid recovery (24 hrs) | Rapid recovery |,,,,,,,,

### Clinical Relevance: Botulism
*   **Significance:** Most serious and fatal form (kills 2/3rd of victims).
*   **Symptoms:** Unlike other types, GI symptoms are slight. Prominent features are **bulbar paralysis**: Diplopia (double vision), Ptosis, Dysarthria, Dysphagia. Consciousness is retained.
*   **Infant Botulism:** Infection of gut followed by *in vivo* toxin production.,

> **Mnemonic for Food Poisoning IPs:**
> *   **S**taph and **C**ereus (Emetic) = **S**hort (1-6 hrs) -> Vomiting is prominent ("**S**pew").
> *   **C**lostridium perfringens and **C**ereus (Diarrheal) = **C**ycles of the clock (12-24 hrs) -> Diarrhea is prominent.
> *   **S**almonella = **S**low (12-24 hrs+) -> Fever is prominent.
> *   **B**otulism = **B**ad (Neuro symptoms, 12-36 hrs).

### Investigation of Food Poisoning Outbreak
1.  **Secure a complete list** of people involved (those who ate and those who didn't).
2.  **History:** Time of ingestion, time of onset (incubation period), specific food items eaten.
3.  **Laboratory Investigations:**
    *   Culture of **stool** and **vomit** from patients.
    *   Culture of suspected **food remnants** (Quantitative: High count required to incriminate, e.g., $10^5$ org/gm for B. cereus).
    *   **Animal experiments:** Injecting filtrate into mice (for Botulism).
4.  **Environmental Study:** Inspection of kitchen, food handlers (for boils, nasal discharge, carrier state).
5.  **Data Analysis:** Calculate **Food-Specific Attack Rates** to identify the vehicle of transmission.

### Differential Diagnosis: Cholera vs. Food Poisoning
| Feature | **Cholera** | **Food Poisoning** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **History** | Epidemic area connection | Shared common meal |
| **Onset** | Purging (Diarrhea) | Vomiting often precedes diarrhea |
| **Vomiting** | Projectile, effortless | Retching, nausea present |
| **Fever** | Rare | Common (Salmonella) |
| **Pain** | Absent | Abdominal cramps present |,

### Treatment
1.  **Rehydration:** The mainstay is fluid replacement using [[Oral Rehydration Solution]] (ORS) or IV fluids if dehydration is severe.
2.  **Symptomatic:** Antiemetics for vomiting.
3.  **Antibiotics:** generally **not** required for self-limiting cases (Staph, B. cereus). Used in severe Salmonella or Shigella infections.
4.  **Botulism Specific:**
    *   **Polyvalent Antitoxin** (50,000 – 100,000 units IV) immediately.
    *   [[Guanidine hydrochloride]] (oral) to reverse neuromuscular block.
    *   Respiratory support (ventilator).

### Prevention and Control
**1. Food Sanitation:**
*   **Meat Inspection:** Ensure animals are disease-free.
*   **Personal Hygiene:** Food handlers must wash hands; exclude those with boils/infectious wounds (Staph source) or diarrhea.
*   **Pasteurization:** Of milk and egg products.

**2. Refrigeration (Temperature Control):**
*   **Danger Zone:** Bacteria multiply rapidly between **10°C and 49°C**.
*   **Golden Rule:** "Cook and eat the same day."
*   Store food below 4°C or above 60°C.
*   Avoid leaving cooked food at room temperature.

**3. Health Education:**
*   Proper handwashing.
*   Avoid eating raw/undercooked meats and eggs.
*   **Sanitary Barrier:** Breaking the fecal-oral route.

**4. Surveillance:** Periodic sampling of food establishments.
