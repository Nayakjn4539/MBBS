# [[Osteochondroma]] (Exostosis)

### Introduction and Definition
*   **Definition:** [[Osteochondroma]] is a cartilage-capped bony projection arising on the external surface of a bone containing a marrow cavity that is continuous with that of the underlying bone.
*   **Nature:** It is the **most common benign bone tumor**.
*   **Hamartoma:** It is not considered a true neoplasm but rather a **developmental malformation** (hamartoma) of the growth plate.
*   **Growth Pattern:** It grows via endochondral ossification and stops growing once skeletal maturity is reached (closure of epiphysis).

### Etiology and Pathogenesis
*   **Origin:** Derived from aberrant cartilage from the growth plate (physis).
*   **Mechanism:** A portion of the epiphyseal cartilage herniates through a defect in the periosteal ring (Ring of Ranvier).
*   **Direction:** As the bone grows in length, the tumor is dragged away from the growth plate (migrates from metaphysis towards diaphysis) due to the pull of attached tendons/muscles.
*   **Genetics:** Associated with mutations in the **EXT gene** (EXT 1 and EXT 2).

### Epidemiology
*   **Age:** Common during the growth period (10–20 years); adolescents.
*   **Sex:** Males are affected more than females (M:F ratio ~ 2:1).

### Anatomical Distribution
*   **Site:** Occurs in the **[[Metaphysis]]** of long bones.
*   **Specific Locations:** Most common around the knee.
    *   Distal Femur (Most common).
    *   Proximal Tibia.
    *   Proximal Humerus.
*   **General Rule:** Usually found at sites of tendinous attachments.

### Pathology
#### Gross Appearance
*   **Types:**
    1.  **Pedunculated:** Has a narrow stalk/pedicle.
    2.  **Sessile:** Has a broad base without a stalk.
*   **Structure:** It is a bony projection covered by a **[[cartilaginous cap]]**.
*   **Continuity:** The cortex and the medullary cavity (marrow) of the tumor are continuous with the cortex and marrow of the parent bone.

#### Microscopic Appearance
*   **Cap:** The cartilage cap resembles a normal growth plate (physis) undergoing endochondral ossification.
*   **Base:** Composed of mature cancellous bone.

### Clinical Features
*   **Asymptomatic:** Many are painless and discovered incidentally on X-rays.
*   **Swelling:** Painless, bony hard lump near a joint. Because it arises from the metaphysis but grows away from the joint, it is rarely intra-articular.
*   **Pain:** Usually indicates a complication (see below).
*   **Mechanical Effects:** May restrict joint movements or cause cosmetic deformity.

### Diagnostic Imaging
#### Plain X-ray
*   **Appearance:** Bony protuberance arising from the metaphysis.
*   **Direction:** Points **away from the joint** (towards the diaphysis).
*   **Continuity:** The cortex and cancellous bone of the tumor are continuous with the host bone.
*   **Cap:** The cartilage cap is radiolucent and *not* visible on X-ray unless it is calcified (blotchy calcification suggests degeneration/size).

#### MRI
*   **Utility:** Best modality to measure the thickness of the **[[cartilaginous cap]]**.
*   **Malignancy Risk:** A cap thickness **> 2 cm** (or > 1 cm in adults according to some sources) is suspicious for malignant transformation.

### Complications
| Complication | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Bursitis** | Formation of an adventitious bursa over the bony prominence (bunion), which may become inflamed and painful. |
| **Fracture** | Fracture of the stalk (pedunculated type) due to trauma. |
| **Neurovascular Compression** | Pressure on adjacent nerves (e.g., peroneal nerve) or vessels (e.g., popliteal artery) causing pseudo-aneurysms or palsies. |
| **Malignant Transformation** | Transformation into **[[Chondrosarcoma]]**. Risk is approx. 1% in solitary lesions and higher (5-10%) in multiple exostoses. |
| **Deformity** | Valgus/Varus deformities or limb length discrepancy (especially in multiple forms). |

**Clinical Signs of Malignancy:**
*   Rapid increase in size (especially after skeletal maturity).
*   Onset of pain in a previously painless lump.
*   Cartilage cap thickness > 2 cm.

### Treatment
1.  **Conservative (Masterly Inactivity):**
    *   Indicated for asymptomatic, static lesions.
    *   Regular observation.

2.  **Surgical Excision (Extra-periosteal excision):**
    *   **Indications:**
        *   Cosmetic reasons.
        *   Pain (bursitis/fracture).
        *   Neurovascular compression/Pressure symptoms.
        *   Mechanical obstruction to joint movement.
        *   Suspicion of malignancy.
    *   **Technique:** Excision must include the **entire cartilage cap and the periosteum** covering the base to prevent recurrence.
    *   **Timing:** Ideally done after skeletal maturity to minimize risk of recurrence or damage to the growth plate.

### Hereditary Multiple Exostosis (HME)
*   **Synonyms:** [[Diaphyseal Aclasis]], Multiple Osteochondromas.
*   **Genetics:** **Autosomal Dominant** disorder (EXT 1 gene mutation).
*   **Features:**
    *   Multiple osteochondromas affecting long and flat bones.
    *   **"Trumpet-shaped" Metaphysis:** Due to failure of remodeling (metaphysis is broad).
    *   Short stature and deformities are common (e.g., **[[Madelung deformity]]** of wrist, Valgus knee).
*   **Malignancy Risk:** Higher than solitary form (approx. 5-10% risk of Chondrosarcoma).
