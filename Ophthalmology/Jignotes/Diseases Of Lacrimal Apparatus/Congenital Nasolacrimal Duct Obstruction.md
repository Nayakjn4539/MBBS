# [[Diseases Of Lacrimal Apparatus]] > Congenital Nasolacrimal Duct Obstruction

# Congenital Nasolacrimal Duct Obstruction (CNLDO)

Also known as **Congenital Dacryocystitis** or **Dacryocystitis Neonatorum**, this is a common condition characterized by chronic inflammation of the [[Lacrimal Sac]] occurring in newborn infants due to the failure of the nasolacrimal duct to canalize.

### Etiology and Pathogenesis
The primary pathology is the stasis of secretions in the lacrimal sac due to congenital blockage of the [[Nasolacrimal Duct]] (NLD).

*   **Primary Cause:** Non-canalization of the NLD. The most common site of obstruction is at the lower end of the duct, caused by a membranous occlusion at the **[[Valve of Hasner]]**.
*   **Other Causes:**
    *   Presence of epithelial debris clogging the duct.
    *   Membranous occlusion at the upper end near the lacrimal sac.
    *   Complete non-canalization (rare).
    *   Bony occlusion (rare).
*   **Mechanism:** Stasis of tears leads to secondary infection. Common causative organisms include *Staphylococci*, *Pneumococci*, *Streptococci*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, and *Enterobacteriaceae*.

> **Clinical Implication:** Approximately 30% of newborn infants have closure of the [[Nasolacrimal Duct]] at birth, but spontaneous canalization often occurs, making the symptomatic disease less frequent.

### Clinical Features
The condition typically presents as a mild grade chronic inflammation.

1.  **Onset:** Usually manifests after 7 days of birth (as tear production is minimal before this period) or within the first few weeks of life.
2.  **Epiphora (Watering):** Persistent watering from one or both eyes.
3.  **Discharge:** Mucopurulent discharge causing sticking of eyelashes (matting), especially after sleep.
4.  **Swelling:** A swelling may appear over the lacrimal sac area (medial canthus).
5.  **[[Regurgitation Test]]:** **Positive**. When steady pressure is applied over the lacrimal sac area (just medial to the medial canthus), mucopurulent discharge regurgitates from the lower [[Punctum]].
6.  **Congenital Dacryocele:** Rarely, children present with a bluish cystic swelling below the medial canthus due to a collection of amniotic fluid or mucus caused by an imperforate Valve of Hasner (amniotocele).

### Differential Diagnosis
It is crucial to differentiate CNLDO from other causes of watering eyes in infants.

| Condition | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Congenital Nasolacrimal Duct Obstruction]]** | Epiphora, mucopurulent discharge, **Positive Regurgitation Test**, eye is usually white (unless conjunctivitis supervenes). |
| **[[Ophthalmia Neonatorum]]** | Bilateral, acute conjunctival inflammation, copious purulent discharge within the first 30 days of life. |
| **[[Congenital Glaucoma]]** | Classic triad: **Photophobia, Blepharospasm, Epiphora**. Enlarged cornea (Buphthalmos), hazy cornea, raised IOP. |
| **[[Congenital Entropion]]** | Inturning of eyelashes causing irritation and watering. |
| **[[Corneal Abrasion]]** | Acute onset watering, history of trauma (e.g., fingernail scratch). |

### Complications
If left untreated, stasis leads to proliferation of bacteria:
*   Recurrent [[Conjunctivitis]].
*   Acute on chronic [[Dacryocystitis]] (Acute exacerbation).
*   **Lacrimal Abscess:** Collection of pus in the sac.
*   **Lacrimal Fistula:** Spontaneous rupture of an abscess may lead to an external fistula.

### Management
The management depends on the age of the child and the severity of the obstruction.

#### 1. Conservative Management (0 to 6–9 Months)
Spontaneous recanalization occurs in about 90% of infants by 6–9 months.
*   **[[Crigler's Massage]] (Lacrimal Sac Massage):** This is the mainstay of treatment.
    *   **Technique:** The parent applies pressure over the common canaliculus with the index finger to block reflux, then strokes downwards firmly over the lacrimal sac. This increases hydrostatic pressure in the sac to rupture the membranous obstruction at the [[Valve of Hasner]].
    *   Frequency: At least 4 times a day.
*   **Topical Antibiotics:** Used to control secondary mucopurulent infection (e.g., Tobramycin, Erythromycin).

#### 2. Minimally Invasive Procedures
If symptoms persist beyond a certain age (protocols vary, usually after 6-12 months).

*   **[[Lacrimal Syringing]]:** Performed to confirm patency or clear debris. Often done before probing.
*   **[[Probing]] (Bowman's Probe):**
    *   **Timing:** Performed if the condition is not cured by 6–12 months.
    *   **Procedure:** Usually under general anesthesia. A probe is passed through the punctum and canaliculus into the sac and down the NLD to mechanically break the membranous obstruction.
    *   **Success Rate:** High. If failed, can be repeated after 3–4 weeks.
*   **Balloon Catheter Dilation (Dacryocystoplasty):** Used if repeated probing fails or if the obstruction is due to scarring/constriction rather than a membrane.
*   **Silicone Tube Intubation:** Indicated if repeated probing and balloon dilation fail. The tube is kept in place for about 6 months.

#### 3. Surgical Management (> 4 Years)
*   **[[Dacryocystorhinostomy]] (DCR):**
    *   **Indication:** When the child presents late (usually > 4 years) or if all conservative measures/probing fail.
    *   **Procedure:** A surgical anastomosis is created between the lacrimal sac and the nasal mucosa (middle meatus) to bypass the NLD obstruction.

### Summary of Management Protocol

| Age Group | Treatment Modality |
| :--- | :--- |
| **0 – 9 Months** | Conservative: **Crigler’s Massage** + Topical Antibiotics. |
| **9 – 12 Months** | **Lacrimal Syringing** (may clear debris). |
| **12 Months – 4 Years** | **Probing** (Bowman’s probe). |
| **> 4 Years** | **Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR)**. |
