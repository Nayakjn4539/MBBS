### Strategies for Polio Eradication in India

The eradication of poliomyelitis in India is considered a major public health achievement. The country was officially certified **Polio-Free** on **27th March 2014**,. To maintain this status and move towards the global endgame, the Government of India employs a multi-pronged strategy.

The core strategies can be summarized into the following major pillars:

#### 1. Pulse Polio Immunization (PPI) Program
Launched in **1995-96**, this is the largest public health campaign ever conducted,.
*   **Concept:** The term "Pulse" refers to the sudden, simultaneous, mass administration of [[Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV)]] on a single day to **all children aged 0–5 years**, regardless of their previous immunization status,.
*   **Objective:** To replace the circulating wild poliovirus with the vaccine virus in the community and break the chain of transmission.
*   **Components:**
    *   **National Immunization Days (NIDs):** Two rounds usually held 4–6 weeks apart during the low transmission season (November to February) covering the entire country,.
    *   **Sub-National Immunization Days (SNIDs):** Conducted in high-risk states or areas (e.g., UP, Bihar) to maintain high immunity levels,.
    *   **Booth + House-to-House:** Vaccination at fixed booths on Day 1, followed by house-to-house searches (Intensified PPI) for missed children for the next 2–3 days,.

#### 2. Strengthening Routine Immunization (RI)
While PPI floods the community with vaccine virus, **Routine Immunization** ensures that every new cohort of newborns is protected individually.
*   **Schedule:** As per the [[National Immunization Schedule (NIS)]], infants receive OPV and [[Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV)]] / [[Fractional IPV (fIPV)]] at **6, 10, and 14 weeks**,,.
*   **Zero Dose:** A dose of OPV is given at birth (institutional deliveries) to maximize uptake.
*   **Target:** Sustaining high coverage (>90%) is essential to prevent the emergence of **Vaccine Derived Polio Viruses (VDPVs)**,.

#### 3. Surveillance: The Backbone of Eradication
Surveillance is the most critical component to verify the absence of the virus and detect importation.

**A. Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) Surveillance**
This is the gold standard for detecting poliovirus transmission.
*   **Definition of AFP:** Sudden onset of weakness/floppiness in any part of the body in a child **<15 years of age**, or paralysis in a person of *any age* if polio is suspected,.
*   **Protocol:**
    1.  **Immediate Reporting:** Within **48 hours** of onset/notification.
    2.  **Stool Collection:** **Two stool samples** must be collected **24–48 hours apart** within **14 days** of the onset of paralysis,.
    3.  **Reverse Cold Chain:** Samples are transported to WHO-accredited labs at **4–8°C**,.
    4.  **Follow-up:** Visit the case after **60 days** to check for residual paralysis,.

**B. Environmental Surveillance**
*   Testing sewage samples from urban areas to detect the presence of wild poliovirus or VDPV in the community even in the absence of clinical cases,.

**Table: Surveillance Indicators (Targets)**,
| Indicator | Target | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Non-polio AFP Rate** | >1 per 100,000 children <15 yrs | Indicates sensitivity of the system to find cases. |
| **Stool Collection** | >80% cases with 2 adequate samples | Ensures lab can effectively rule out polio. |
| **Laboratory Results** | Results within 28 days | Timeliness for rapid response. |

#### 4. Mopping Up Operations
This is a "fire-fighting" strategy used as the final attack on the virus in high-risk districts.
*   **Criteria:** Door-to-door immunization in areas where the wild virus is known or suspected to be circulating.
*   **Scope:** Covers extensive areas (house-to-house) regardless of previous vaccination status.

#### 5. Polio Endgame Strategy (The "Switch")
To eliminate the risk of **Vaccine-Associated Paralytic Polio (VAPP)** and **Vaccine-Derived Polio Virus (cVDPV)** caused by the type 2 vaccine strain,.
*   **The Switch (April 2016):** Global synchronized switch from **Trivalent OPV (tOPV)** (containing types 1, 2, 3) to **Bivalent OPV (bOPV)** (containing types 1 and 3 only),.
*   **Introduction of IPV:** Introduction of Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) into the routine schedule to provide immunity against Type 2 virus after the withdrawal of OPV2.
    *   **Dose:** **fIPV (Fractional IPV)** 0.1 ml ID is given at **6 weeks and 14 weeks**,. A **third dose** of fIPV at **9 months** was introduced in Jan 2023.

### 💡 Clinical Relevance
*   **VAPP (Vaccine Associated Paralytic Polio):** Rare paralysis caused by the live attenuated virus in OPV reverting to neurovirulence. Occurs in ~1 in 1 million doses.
*   **VDPV (Vaccine Derived Polio Virus):** Strains of polio vaccine virus that have mutated and regained virulence, capable of causing outbreaks in communities with low immunization coverage.
*   **Differential Diagnosis of AFP:** Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), Transverse Myelitis, Traumatic Neuritis.

### 🤡 Mnemonic: "PRISM" for Polio Eradication
To remember the main strategies:
*   **P** - **P**ulse Polio Immunization (Mass campaigns)
*   **R** - **R**outine Immunization (High coverage with OPV/IPV)
*   **I** - **I**PV Introduction & The Switch (Endgame strategy)
*   **S** - **S**urveillance (AFP and Environmental)
*   **M** - **M**opping up operations
