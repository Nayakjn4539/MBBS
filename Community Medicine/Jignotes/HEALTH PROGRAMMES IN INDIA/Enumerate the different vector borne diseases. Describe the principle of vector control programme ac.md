# [[HEALTH PROGRAMMES IN INDIA]] > Enumerate the different vector borne diseases. Describe the principle of vector control programme according to the existing National Programme.

### Enumeration of Vector-Borne Diseases in India

Under the **[[National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme]] (NVBDCP)**, the Government of India monitors and controls six major vector-borne diseases.

| Disease | Vector | Causative Agent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. [[Malaria]]** | Female *[[Anopheles]]* mosquito | *Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax* |
| **2. [[Lymphatic Filariasis]]** | *[[Culex quinquefasciatus]]* | *Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi* |
| **3. [[Dengue]]** | *[[Aedes aegypti]]* | Dengue Virus (Flavivirus) |
| **4. [[Chikungunya]]** | *[[Aedes aegypti]]* / *Aedes albopictus* | Chikungunya Virus (Alphavirus) |
| **5. [[Japanese Encephalitis]]** | *[[Culex tritaeniorhynchus]]* | JE Virus (Flavivirus) |
| **6. [[Kala-azar]]** (Visceral Leishmaniasis) | *[[Phlebotomus argentipes]]* (Sandfly) | *Leishmania donovani* |

### Principles of Vector Control Programme

The current National Programme (NVBDCP) follows the principle of **[[Integrated Vector Management]] (IVM)**. This approach uses a combination of biological, chemical, and physical interventions to achieve cost-effective control and reduce reliance on a single method (like insecticides), thereby delaying the development of resistance.

The principles are categorized as follows:

#### 1. Anti-Larval Measures
Targeting the immature stages of the vector is often more effective and permanent.
*   **Environmental Control (Source Reduction):**
    *   Elimination of breeding places by filling, leveling, and drainage.
    *   **Water Management:** Intermittent irrigation and sluicing to disrupt mosquito breeding cycles.
    *   **Domestic Hygiene:** Covering overhead tanks, emptying coolers/flower pots (crucial for *[[Aedes aegypti]]*).
*   **Chemical Larvicides:**
    *   Use of **[[Temephos]]** (Abate) in potable water.
    *   **Mosquito Larvicidal Oil (MLO)** in polluted water bodies.
    *   **Paris Green** (specifically for *Anopheles*).
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Use of **[[Larvivorous fish]]** like *[[Gambusia affinis]]* and *Poecilia reticulata* (Guppy fish) in ponds and tanks.
    *   Use of biolarvicides like *Bacillus thuringiensis* var. *israelensis* (Bti).

#### 2. Anti-Adult Measures
Targeting the adult vector to interrupt transmission rapidly.
*   **[[Indoor Residual Spray]] (IRS):**
    *   Spraying human dwellings and cattle sheds with insecticides (DDT, Malathion, or Synthetic Pyrethroids).
    *   *Principle:* The vector rests on walls after biting; the residual insecticide kills it, shortening its life span below the incubation period of the parasite.
*   **Space Spraying (Fogging):**
    *   **Ultra-Low Volume (ULV)** sprays or thermal fogging used during epidemics (e.g., Dengue/JE outbreaks) to rapidly knockdown the adult vector population.

#### 3. Personal Protection
Preventing man-vector contact.
*   **[[Insecticide Treated Bed Nets]] (ITNs) / Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs):**
    *   Highly promoted under NVBDCP, especially in high-risk tribal and rural areas.
    *   Acts as a physical barrier and kills mosquitoes attempting to bite through the net.
*   Use of repellents, protective clothing, and screening of houses.

#### 4. Legislative Measures
*   Enforcement of civic by-laws to prevent mosquitogenic conditions (e.g., fines for allowing water stagnation in urban construction sites).

#### 5. Entomological Surveillance
*   Regular monitoring of vector density, seasonal prevalence, and **insecticide susceptibility status** to guide decision-making.

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Dengue/Chikungunya:** Vectors breed in **artificial water containers** (coolers, tyres). Control focuses on "Dry Day" observance (emptying containers once a week).
*   **Malaria:** *Anopheles* breeds in **clean water**. IRS is the mainstay in rural areas.
*   **Filaria:** *Culex* breeds in **dirty/polluted water**. Control focuses on larvicides and hygiene.
