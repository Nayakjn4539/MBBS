# [[Ocular Injuries]] > Intraocular Foreign Bodies

### Intraocular Foreign Bodies (IOFB)

[[Intraocular Foreign Bodies]] (IOFBs) are a form of penetrating ocular injury where the foreign object is retained within the eyeball. They constitute a serious emergency due to the risks of mechanical damage, infection, and toxic reactions.

### Etiology and Epidemiology
*   **Common Materials:**
    *   **Magnetic:** Iron and steel (90% of cases).
    *   **Non-magnetic:** Glass, stone, lead pellets, copper percussion caps, aluminium, plastic, and wood.
*   **Mechanism:** Usually caused by high-velocity projectiles.
    *   **Chisel and Hammer injuries:** It is commonly a chip of the **chisel** (steel) and *not* the stone that enters the eye.
    *   **Lathe workers:** High-speed metallic chips.
    *   **Gunshot/Pellet injuries.**

### Modes of Damage
An IOFB can damage the eye via three main mechanisms:
1.  **Mechanical Effects:** Immediate trauma to the [[Cornea]], [[Iris]], [[Lens]] (cataract), [[Vitreous Humor]] (hemorrhage), and [[Retina]] (detachment/hole).
2.  **Introduction of Infection:**
    *   **Endophthalmitis:** Bacterial or Fungal.
    *   **Panophthalmitis:** Especially with wood or stone.
    *   *Note:* Small flying metallic bodies are often sterile due to the heat generated during emission, but wood carries a high risk of infection.
3.  **Reaction of Foreign Body:** Depends on the chemical nature of the material.

### Tissue Reactions to IOFB

The reaction of ocular tissues depends on whether the FB is **Inorganic** or **Organic**.

#### 1. Inorganic Foreign Bodies
The reaction varies based on the chemical composition:

| Reaction Type | Materials | Pathophysiology |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **No Reaction (Inert)** | Glass, plastic, porcelain, gold, silver, platinum | Tissues tolerate these well; they may remain quiescent for years. |
| **Local Irritative** | Lead, Aluminium | Produces a local reaction leading to **encapsulation** of the foreign body. |
| **Suppurative** | **Pure** Copper, Zinc, Nickel, Mercury | Causes acute purulent inflammation (sterile hypopyon/abscess) due to marked chemical toxicity. |
| **Specific Toxic** | Iron, Copper Alloys | Causes [[Siderosis Bulbi]] or [[Chalcosis]] (See below). |

#### 2. Organic Foreign Bodies
*   **Materials:** Wood, vegetable matter, caterpillar hair.
*   **Reaction:**
    *   Produces a **proliferative reaction** characterized by the formation of **giant cells**.
    *   High risk of [[Fungal Endophthalmitis]].
    *   [[Ophthalmia Nodosum]]: Caused by caterpillar hair (severe granulomatous iridocyclitis with nodules).

### Specific Chemical Reactions

#### A. Siderosis Bulbi (Iron Toxicity)
Occurs when a ferrous (iron) foreign body is retained. It typically manifests **2 months to 2 years** after injury.
*   **Pathogenesis:** Iron undergoes electrolytic dissociation. Disseminated iron ions combine with intracellular proteins, causing degenerative changes, primarily affecting **epithelial structures**.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    1.  **Lens:** **Rusty/Orange deposits** arranged radially in a ring (anterior epithelium/capsule). Leads to [[Cataract]].
    2.  **Iris:** Initially stained greenish, later becomes reddish-brown ([[Heterochromia Iridis]]).
    3.  **Retina:** Pigmentary degeneration resembling [[Retinitis Pigmentosa]].
    4.  **Glaucoma:** [[Secondary Open Angle Glaucoma]] due to degenerative changes in the [[Trabecular Meshwork]].
*   **Diagnosis:** **Prussian Blue reaction** stains iron deposits blue.
*   **ERG:** Initially hypernormal, followed by progressive attenuation of the **b-wave** (negative ERG).

#### B. Chalcosis (Copper Alloy Toxicity)
Occurs with copper alloys (e.g., brass, bronze). Unlike iron, copper deposits under membranous structures and does **not** cause degenerative changes.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    1.  **Cornea:** **Kayser-Fleischer Ring** (Greenish-golden ring at Descemet’s membrane).
    2.  **Lens:** **Sunflower Cataract** (anterior subcapsular deposition in a petaloid pattern).
    3.  **Retina:** Deposition of **Golden Plaques** at the posterior pole.

### Diagnosis and Localization

#### 1. History
*   Crucial to identify the mechanism (e.g., hammering, grinding). Patient may be unaware of the entry.

#### 2. Ocular Examination
*   **Slit Lamp:** Look for a corneal scar (entry site), [[Iris]] hole (transillumination defect), or track through the [[Lens]].
*   **Gonioscopy:** To detect FBs hidden in the angle of the [[Anterior Chamber]].
*   **Ophthalmoscopy:** Direct visualization if media is clear.

#### 3. Imaging
| Modality | Utility & Features |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Plain X-Ray** | Useful for radio-opaque FBs. **Bone-free dental films** can detect small anterior FBs. |
| **CT Scan** | **Investigation of Choice (IOC).** Detects metallic, glass, and stone FBs. Accurate localization. |
| **USG (B-Scan)** | Useful for non-radio-opaque FBs (glass, wood). Can detect associated [[Retinal Detachment]] or [[Vitreous Hemorrhage]]. |
| **MRI** | **CONTRAINDICATED** if metallic FB is suspected (magnetic field can move the FB causing severe damage). Useful only for wood/plastic after metal is ruled out by CT. |

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Limbal Ring Method of Localization
*(Though largely replaced by CT, exams may ask about this historical method where a metallic ring is sutured to the limbus and X-rays are taken in different gazes to localize the FB relative to the ring.)*

### Management

**Principle:** IOFB should generally be removed to prevent infection and toxic reactions, unless it is inert and removal poses a greater risk to vision than retention.

#### 1. Medical Management
*   Systemic and topical **Antibiotics** (Prophylaxis against [[Endophthalmitis]]).
*   **Tetanus Toxoid** prophylaxis.
*   [[Cycloplegics]] and anti-inflammatory drugs.

#### 2. Surgical Removal
The route depends on the location and magnetic nature of the FB.

*   **Anterior Chamber FB:**
    *   Removed through a limbal incision closest to the FB.
    *   **Magnetic:** Hand-held electromagnet.
    *   **Non-magnetic:** Toothless forceps.

*   **Introlenticular FB:**
    *   If cataractous: [[Extracapsular Cataract Extraction]] (ECCE) or [[Phacoemulsification]] with IOL implantation. The FB is removed with the lens matter.

*   **Posterior Segment (Vitreous/Retina) FB:**
    *   **Pars Plana Vitrectomy (PPV):** The standard of care.
    *   **Technique:**
        1.  3-port [[Pars Plana Vitrectomy]].
        2.  FB is freed from vitreous/capsule using a vitreous cutter or pick.
        3.  **Magnetic:** Removed using an intraocular magnet.
        4.  **Non-magnetic:** Removed using vitreous forceps.
    *   **Laser:** Endolaser is applied around the impact site on the retina to prevent detachment.

### Mnemonics
*   **Reaction to Metals:**
    *   **Iron (Fe):** **F**erocious reaction (Siderosis - Degenerative).
    *   **Copper (Cu):** **Cu**te reaction (Chalcosis - Deposition/Non-degenerative).
*   **Siderosis Signs:** **"RUST"**
    *   **R**etinal degeneration (RP like)
    *   **U**veal color change (Heterochromia)
    *   **S**econdary Glaucoma
    *   **T**ea-colored/Rusty cataract
