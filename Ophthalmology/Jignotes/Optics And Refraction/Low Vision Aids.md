# Low Vision Aids

### Definition and Criteria
**[[Low Vision]]** is a term used to signify impairment of sight that is not fully correctable by medical, surgical, or standard refractive means (spectacles or contact lenses).

*   **WHO Definition:** A person with low vision is one who has impairment of visual functioning even after treatment and/or standard refractive correction, and has:
    *   Visual acuity of **less than 6/18** to light perception due to the loss of visual acuity.
    *   OR a [[Visual Field]] of **less than 10 degrees** from the point of fixation.
    *   BUT who uses, or is potentially able to use, vision for the planning and/or execution of a task.

### Common Causes
Low vision can result from various congenital or acquired conditions involving the eye or visual pathways. Common causes include:
*   **[[Age-Related Macular Degeneration]] (ARMD):** Affects central vision.
*   **[[Glaucoma]]:** Causes tunnel vision.
*   **[[Diabetic Retinopathy]]:** Causes scotomas and fluctuating vision.
*   **[[Retinitis Pigmentosa]]:** Causes night blindness and field constriction.
*   **[[Pathological Myopia]]:** Progressive degenerative changes.
*   **[[Albinism]]:** Associated with photophobia and nystagmus.

### Classification of Low Vision Aids (LVA)

[[Low Vision Aids]] are optical or non-optical devices designed to improve the usable vision of the patient.

#### 1. Optical Aids
These devices use lenses or combinations of lenses to provide magnification.

**A. Aids for Distant Vision**
The primary device used for distance is the **[[Telescope]]**.
*   **Principle:** They utilize the optical principle of a **Galilean telescope**.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Hand-held Telescopes:** Monocular or binocular. Useful for spotting (e.g., reading bus numbers, street signs).
    *   **Spectacle-mounted Telescopes:** Mounted on the spectacle lens.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   Small [[Visual Field]].
    *   Difficult to use/requires training.
    *   Cosmetically noticeable.
    *   Objects appear closer (distortion of depth).

**B. Aids for Near Vision**
These are used primarily for reading and close work.

| Type | Description & Mechanism | Clinical Indication/Pros & Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Spectacle Magnifiers** | High plus (convex) lenses mounted in frames. | **Pros:** Hands-free, wide field of view.<br>**Cons:** Very short working distance (reading material must be held close to the face). |
| **Hand-held Magnifiers** | Convex lens held by the patient. May have in-built illumination. | **Pros:** Portable, inexpensive, familiar to patients.<br>**Cons:** Requires steady hand control; distance from object must be maintained. |
| **Stand Magnifiers** | Convex lens mounted on a stand that rests on the page. | **Pros:** Height is adjustable/fixed; useful for patients with **tremors** or arthritis (poor hand control). Good for long reading duration.<br>**Cons:** Bulky. |
| **Telemicroscopes** | Telescopes modified for near viewing. | **Pros:** Increases working distance (good for writing/typing).<br>**Cons:** Small field of view, expensive. |

#### 2. Non-Optical Aids
These improve visual function by modifying environmental factors or enhancing contrast rather than magnifying the image optically.

*   **Illumination:** High-intensity lamps (e.g., gooseneck lamps) to improve contrast and visibility.
*   **Glare Control:**
    *   **Filters/Tints:** **Glare-reducing** and **blue-blocking lenses** (e.g., amber or yellow tints) improve comfort and contrast.
    *   Typoscopes (black card with a slit) to reduce glare from white paper.
*   **Relative Size Magnification:** Large print books, large button telephones.
*   **Relative Distance Magnification:** Moving closer to the object (e.g., sitting closer to the TV).
*   **Reading Stands:** To hold books at the proper distance and angle.
*   **Pinhole Spectacles:** Multiple holed pinhole discs can be used as a low vision aid to improve acuity by reducing refractive aberrations.

#### 3. Electronic/Digital Aids
These utilize video or computer technology to enhance vision.
*   **Video Magnifiers (CCTV - Closed Circuit Television):** Projects printed material onto a screen.
    *   **Advantages:** High magnification, ability to manipulate contrast (e.g., white letters on black background), and brightness control.
*   **Computer Software:** Screen readers (Text-to-Speech) and screen magnifiers.
*   **Scanners:** Attached to computers to "read" printed material via a voice synthesizer.

### Principles of Visual Rehabilitation
Management of a patient with low vision is not just about prescribing a device; it involves a holistic rehabilitation process.

1.  **Assessment:**
    *   Detailed history of visual needs (reading, sewing, mobility).
    *   Assessment of **Best Corrected Visual Acuity ([[BCVA]])** for distance and near.
    *   Assessment of **Contrast Sensitivity** and **[[Visual Field]]**.
2.  **Prescription:** Selection of the appropriate optical or non-optical aid based on the specific task (e.g., stand magnifier for reading, telescope for outdoor use).
3.  **Training:**
    *   **Eccentric Viewing:** Training the patient to use a para-foveal area (retinal locus) if the fovea is damaged (e.g., in ARMD).
    *   **Device Training:** Teaching the patient how to focus and maintain the focal distance.
    *   **Mobility Training:** Use of a cane or sighted guide technique.
4.  **Psychosocial Support:** Counseling to accept the disability and motivation to use residual vision.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Contrast Sensitivity:** In diseases like **[[Cataract]]** or **[[Glaucoma]]**, visual acuity on Snellen's chart may be relatively good, but the patient may be severely handicapped due to loss of contrast. Contrast sensitivity testing (e.g., Pelli-Robson chart) is crucial.
*   **Lighting:** Patients with **[[Macular Degeneration]]** often require high levels of illumination, while those with **[[Albinism]]** or **[[Aniridia]]** require glare control and lower illumination levels.
*   **Tremors:** In geriatric patients with Parkinson's or tremors, **stand magnifiers** are superior to hand-held ones.
