# [[Firearms And Ballistics]] > Choking in Firearms

### Definition
**Choking** refers to the **constriction** or narrowing of the **bore** of the barrel at the **muzzle end** (distal end) of a [[Shotgun]].

It is a feature specific to **smooth-bored firearms** (shotguns) and is not typically found in standard rifled weapons like pistols or rifles.

### Anatomy of the Choke
*   **Location:** The constriction is usually present in the **distal 7 to 10 cm** of the barrel.
*   **Mechanism:** The diameter of the barrel gradually tapers towards the muzzle.

### Purpose and Function
The primary objective of choking is to control the spread of the [[Lead Shot/Pellets]].
1.  **Reduces Dispersion:** It lessens the rate of spread (dispersion) of the shot after it leaves the muzzle.
2.  **Increases Effective Range:** By keeping the pellets grouped together in a compact mass for a longer distance, it increases the effective killing range of the weapon.
3.  **Increases Velocity:** It increases the explosive force and velocity of the shot charge.
4.  **Concentrates Impact:** It ensures a denser pattern of impact on the target.

### Degrees of Choking
The degree of constriction varies, and guns are classified based on the amount of narrowing at the muzzle.

| Type of Bore | Description | Effect on Shot Spread |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **True Cylinder** | No constriction. Same diameter throughout the barrel. | Maximum spread (widest pattern) |
| **Improved Cylinder** | Very slight constriction at the muzzle. | Slight reduction in spread |
| **Quarter Choke** | Minor constriction. | Moderate reduction |
| **Half Choke** | Moderate constriction. | Significant reduction |
| **Full Choke** | Maximum constriction. | Minimum spread (tightest pattern) |

*   **Note:** In a fully choked gun, the pellets are kept in a tight mass for a longer distance compared to a cylinder bore.

### Paradox Gun
This is a special type of shotgun.
*   It is essentially a smooth-bored gun but has **rifling** in the **terminal part** (the choke area) of the barrel.
*   **Purpose:** This allows the gun to fire solid lead slugs with reasonable accuracy (like a rifle) while still being able to fire shot pellets.

### Medicolegal Importance
1.  **Range Estimation:** This is the most critical aspect. The degree of choking significantly alters the dispersion pattern of pellets.
    *   A **Full Choke** gun will produce a hole/pattern at a specific distance that is much smaller (tighter) than a **Cylinder Bore** gun at the same contact distance.
    *   *Example:* A full choke gun may produce a pattern at 40 yards that a cylinder bore would produce at 20 yards.
    *   Therefore, to accurately estimate the [[Range of Fire]], the specific weapon used in the crime must be test-fired. General rule-of-thumb dispersion formulas may be inaccurate if the degree of choke is unknown.
2.  **Wound Severity:** Shotgun wounds at contact and close range cause massive tissue destruction (more than rifled weapons) due to the compact mass of shot and gas. Choking maintains this "compact mass" effect for a slightly longer distance.
3.  **Identification of Weapon:** Examining the wound pattern can sometimes give a clue as to whether the weapon was choked or not, provided the distance is known.

### Mnemonics
To remember the progression of spread from widest to tightest:
**"Cylinders Improve Quarter by Quarter until Full"**
*   **Cylinder** (Widest)
*   **Improved** Cylinder
*   **Quarter** Choke
*   **Half** Choke
*   **Full** Choke (Tightest)
