# Preoperative Preparation: Eye Speculums

In ophthalmic surgery, the **[[Eye Speculum]]** is a critical instrument used to maintain the separation of the eyelids (retract the lids) to provide adequate exposure of the eyeball and keep the eyelashes away from the surgical field.

### Common Types of Eye Speculums

There are three primary types of lid speculums used in clinical practice:

| Type of Speculum | Features | Clinical Utility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Universal Metallic Eye Speculum]]** | • Has two limbs and a spring mechanism with a screw to adjust the width of the limb separation.<br>• The blades are open (fenestrated).<br>• Called "Universal" because it can be used for both the right and left eye. | General ophthalmic surgeries where adjustable retraction is needed. |
| **Speculum with Guard (Solid Blades)** | • Similar mechanism but features **solid blades** instead of open wire loops.<br>• Designed to cover the lid margin. | • Specifically useful to **keep the [[Eyelashes]] away** from the sterile field of operation.<br>• Prevents lashes from contaminating the surgical site. |
| **[[Wire Speculum]]** | • Very lightweight structure.<br>• Exerts **minimal pressure** on the [[Eyeball]].<br>• Also universal (fits both eyes). | • Preferred in pediatric cases or when minimal pressure on the globe is required (e.g., open globe injuries or intraocular surgeries where IOP control is critical). |

### Procedure for Application (Preoperative Steps)

The speculum is inserted after the initial cleaning and draping of the patient.

1.  **Site Preparation:** The eye is cleaned with **[[Povidone-Iodine]]** (5% or 10%) on the skin of the eyelids and allowed to dry.
2.  **Draping:** A self-adhesive sterile surgical eye drape is applied to the skin around the eyelids.
3.  **Exposure:** The drape is cut transversely along the **[[Palpebral aperture]]**.
4.  **Lash Isolation:** The cut edges of the drape are folded over the lid margins. Crucially, the **[[Eyelashes]]** must be tucked underneath the drape to prevent contamination.
5.  **Insertion:** The speculum is then inserted to keep the eye open for surgery.

### Clinical Indications for Use

Eye speculums are employed to keep the lids apart during a wide variety of ophthalmic procedures:

**1. Intraocular Surgeries**
*   **[[Cataract Surgery]]** (Phacoemulsification, SICS, ECCE).
*   **[[Glaucoma Surgery]]** (Trabeculectomy).
*   **[[Keratoplasty]]** (Corneal transplantation).

**2. Extraocular Surgeries**
*   **[[Squint Surgery]]** (Strabismus correction).
*   **[[Pterygium Surgery]]**.

**3. Destructive Surgeries**
*   **[[Enucleation]]** (Removal of the eyeball).
*   **[[Evisceration]]** (Removal of intraocular contents).

**4. Minor Procedures & Examination**
*   Removal of **[[Conjunctival foreign body]]** or **[[Corneal foreign body]]**.
*   Cauterization of a **[[Corneal ulcer]]**.
*   Examination of the eye in a patient suffering from severe **[[Blepharospasm]]**.
*   **[[Intravitreal injection]]** administration.
*   **[[Cyclocryotherapy]]** (Lid separation allows access to the sclera 3mm from limbus).

### Clinical Implications

*   **Minimizing Pressure:** In surgeries where rising **[[Intraocular Pressure]]** (IOP) or vitreous loss is a risk (e.g., during cataract surgery), minimizing external pressure on the eyeball is crucial. This includes not using a heavy eye speculum or one that exerts pressure on the globe. A wire speculum is often preferred in these scenarios.
*   **Protection:** The solid blade speculum is particularly indicated if the patient has long lashes or if the drape does not adequately isolate the lashes, as it physically blocks them from the surgical field.
