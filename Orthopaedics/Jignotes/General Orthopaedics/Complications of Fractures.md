# Complications of Fractures

Fracture complications can be devastating, sometimes more so than the injury itself. They range from minor annoyances to life-threatening emergencies. For clinical and academic purposes, these are best classified based on the **time of onset** and **location**.

## Classification of Complications

| Time of Onset | Systemic (General) | Local |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Immediate** (At time of injury) | • [[Hypovolaemic shock]] (Hemorrhage)<br>• Neurogenic shock | • [[Vascular injury]]<br>• [[Nerve injury]]<br>• Skin loss/Soft tissue injury<br>• Visceral injury (e.g., bladder, lung) |
| **Early** (First few days/weeks) | • [[Fat embolism syndrome]] (FES)<br>• [[Deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT)<br>• [[Pulmonary embolism]] (PE)<br>• [[Crush syndrome]]<br>• [[Adult respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS)<br>• Tetanus / Gas gangrene | • [[Compartment syndrome]]<br>• [[Volkmann's Ischemia]]<br>• Infection ([[Osteomyelitis]])<br>• Implant failure |
| **Late** (Weeks to years) | | • [[Delayed union]]<br>• [[Non-union]]<br>• [[Malunion]]<br>• [[Avascular necrosis]] (AVN)<br>• [[Myositis ossificans]]<br>• [[Sudeck's osteodystrophy]] (CRPS)<br>• Joint stiffness / [[Osteoarthritis]]<br>• Growth disturbance (in children) |

## I. Systemic Complications

### 1. Hypovolaemic Shock
*   **Cause:** Blood loss from the fracture site (internal or external) and soft tissue injury.
*   **Significance:** Pelvic fractures can cause massive retroperitoneal hemorrhage (1.5–2 Liters or more); Femur shaft fractures can lose 1–1.5 Liters.
*   **Clinical Features:** Tachycardia, hypotension, cold clammy skin, anxiety.
*   **Management:** "A to F management" guidelines (Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure). Secure IV access, crystalloids/colloids/blood transfusion.

### 2. Fat Embolism Syndrome (FES)
*   **Pathology:** Release of fat globules from bone marrow into the bloodstream, usually following long bone fractures (Femur, Tibia) or pelvic fractures, especially in young adults. These globules block pulmonary or cerebral capillaries.
*   **Onset:** Typically 24–72 hours after injury.
*   **Diagnosis:** **Gurd’s Criteria** is the gold standard.

**Gurd's Criteria for Diagnosis (Need 1 Major + 4 Minor)**

| Major Criteria | Minor Criteria |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1. Respiratory Insufficiency ($PaO_2 < 60$ mmHg, cyanosis) | 1. Tachycardia (>110/min) |
| 2. Cerebral Involvement (Confusion, drowsiness, coma) | 2. Pyrexia (>38.5°C) |
| 3. **Petechial Rash** (Axillary or subconjunctival) | 3. Retinal emboli |
| | 4. Fat globules in urine/sputum |
| | 5. Sudden drop in Hemoglobin/Platelets |
| | 6. Increased ESR |

*   **Clinical Implication:** Early fixation of fractures reduces the risk of FES.
*   **Treatment:** Supportive (Oxygen, Ventilator support if ARDS develops), Fluids, Corticosteroids (controversial).

### 3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) & Pulmonary Embolism (PE)
*   **Risk Factors:** Prolonged immobilization (Virchow's triad: stasis, intimal injury, hypercoagulability), elderly patients, hip/pelvic fractures.
*   **Clinical Features:** Calf tenderness/swelling (DVT); Dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis (PE).
*   **Prevention:** Mechanical prophylaxis (stockings, pumps), Pharmacological (Low Molecular Weight Heparin).

### 4. Crush Syndrome
*   **Pathology:** Occurs when a limb is compressed for a prolonged period. Muscle necrosis ([[Rhabdomyolysis]]) releases myoglobin, potassium, and toxic metabolites. Upon release of compression, these flood the circulation.
*   **Consequences:** Acute renal failure (myoglobinuria blocks tubules), metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia (cardiac arrhythmia).
*   **Management:** Aggressive fluid resuscitation, alkalization of urine (Sodium Bicarbonate).

## II. Local Complications - Immediate & Early

### 1. Neurovascular Injury
*   **Vascular:** Common in supracondylar humerus fractures ([[Brachial artery]]) and knee dislocations ([[Popliteal artery]]).
    *   **Management:** Prompt reduction; if pulse doesn't return, explore/repair.
*   **Nerve:**
    *   **Neuropraxia:** Physiological block, recovery expected.
    *   **Axonotmesis:** Axon interruption, sheath intact.
    *   **Neurotmesis:** Complete division.
    *   *Common Associations:*
        *   Shoulder dislocation → [[Axillary nerve]]
        *   Humerus shaft fracture → [[Radial nerve]]
        *   Medial epicondyle fracture → [[Ulnar nerve]]
        *   Fibula neck fracture → [[Common peroneal nerve]].

### 2. Compartment Syndrome
*   **Definition:** Increased pressure within a closed osteofascial compartment that compromises circulation and function of tissues within that space.
*   **Common Sites:** Forearm (Volkmann's) and Leg (Tibial fractures).
*   **Clinical Features (The 5 P's):**
    1.  **P**ain (Out of proportion to injury, **Pain on Passive Stretch** is the earliest and most reliable sign).
    2.  **P**allor.
    3.  **P**aresthesia.
    4.  **P**aralysis (Late sign).
    5.  **P**ulselessness (Very late sign; presence of pulse does *not* rule it out).
*   **Sequelae:** If untreated, leads to muscle necrosis and fibrosis, resulting in [[Volkmann’s Ischemic Contracture]].
*   **Treatment:** Immediate decompression via **Fasciotomy**.

### 3. Infection
*   **Types:** [[Osteomyelitis]] or [[Gas gangrene]].
*   **Risk:** Highest in open fractures.
*   **Pathology:** Biofilm formation on implants/dead bone leads to chronic infection.
*   **Management:** Debridement, Antibiotics, remove hardware if necessary.

## III. Local Complications - Late (Bone Healing)

### 1. Delayed Union
*   **Definition:** Fracture has not healed within the expected time but still has the *potential* to heal.
*   **Causes:** Inadequate immobilization, infection, poor blood supply, distraction of fragments.
*   **X-ray:** Fracture line visible, minimal callus, no sclerosis of ends.
*   **Treatment:** Prolonged immobilization, bone stimulation, or surgery (grafting).

### 2. Non-Union
*   **Definition:** Fracture has not healed and shows *no potential* to heal without intervention (usually > 6-9 months).
*   **Types:**
    *   **Hypertrophic:** (Elephant foot) – Good blood supply, but excessive movement/instability. *Treatment:* Rigid fixation (Stability).
    *   **Atrophic:** (Tapered ends) – Poor blood supply/biology. *Treatment:* Bone grafting + Fixation.
    *   **Oligotrophic:** Minimal callus.
*   **Clinical:** Painless abnormal mobility (false joint/pseudoarthrosis).

### 3. Malunion
*   **Definition:** Fracture heals in an anatomically abnormal position (angulation, rotation, or shortening).
*   **Functional vs. Cosmetic:** Some malunions are cosmetically poor but functionally acceptable (e.g., clavicle). Others cause joint incongruity and osteoarthritis.
*   **Treatment:** [[Osteotomy]] (cutting the bone to realign).

## IV. Local Complications - Late (Others)

### 1. Avascular Necrosis (AVN) / Osteonecrosis
*   **Pathology:** Interruption of blood supply leads to bone death.
*   **Vulnerable Sites:**
    *   **Head of Femur** (Fracture neck of femur).
    *   **Proximal Scaphoid** (Fracture waist of scaphoid).
    *   **Body of Talus** (Fracture neck of talus).
*   **Mnemonic for Causes of AVN:** **SCLERA**.
    *   **S** - Steroids
    *   **C** - Caisson's disease
    *   **L** - Lupus (SLE)
    *   **E** - Ethanol (Alcohol)
    *   **R** - Radiation/Rheumatoid arthritis
    *   **A** - Arterial injury (Trauma)
*   **X-ray:** Increased density (sclerosis) of the necrotic segment.

### 2. Myositis Ossificans
*   **Definition:** Heterotopic ossification (bone formation) within muscle following trauma/hematoma.
*   **Common Sites:** [[Brachialis]] (after elbow trauma/dislocation), Quadriceps (thigh trauma).
*   **Risk Factor:** **Massage** or forceful passive mobilization of an injured elbow.
*   **Treatment:** Rest, NSAIDs (Indomethacin). Surgical excision *only* after the mass matures (active phase surgery leads to recurrence).

### 3. Sudeck’s Osteodystrophy (CRPS)
*   **Also known as:** Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (Type 1), Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy.
*   **Clinical Features:** Burning pain, hyperesthesia, shiny/red skin, stiffness, swelling. Symptoms are disproportionate to the injury.
*   **X-ray:** Spotty/patchy osteoporosis (Sudek's atrophy).
*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy (active mobilization), analgesics, sympathetic nerve blocks.

### 4. Joint Stiffness & Osteoarthritis
*   **Stiffness:** "Fracture disease". Caused by intra-articular adhesions or extra-articular fibrosis due to prolonged immobilization. Prevention: Early mobilization.
*   **Post-traumatic Osteoarthritis:** Occurs if intra-articular fractures heal with a "step" or incongruity, wearing down the cartilage.

### 5. Growth Disturbance
*   **Context:** Pediatric fractures involving the [[Physis]] (Growth plate).
*   **Result:** Premature fusion leading to shortening or angular deformity (e.g., Valgus/Varus).
