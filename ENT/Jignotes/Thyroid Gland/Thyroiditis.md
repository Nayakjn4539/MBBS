# Thyroiditis

[[Thyroiditis]] encompasses a group of disorders characterized by inflammation of the [[thyroid gland]]. These conditions present with a spectrum of clinical features ranging from acute pain and systemic toxicity to painless goiter and thyroid dysfunction (hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism).

## Classification of Thyroiditis

The inflammatory conditions of the thyroid can be broadly classified based on onset and pathology:

| Type | Nature | Key Feature | Etiology |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hashimoto's Thyroiditis** | Chronic, Autoimmune | Painless, firm goiter, Hypothyroidism | Autoimmune (Anti-TPO Ab) |
| **De Quervain's Thyroiditis** | Subacute, Granulomatous | **Painful** goiter, Viral prodrome | Viral, Post-viral |
| **Riedel's Thyroiditis** | Chronic, Fibrous | Woody hard, fixed mass | IgG4-related/Fibrosis |
| **Acute Suppurative Thyroiditis** | Acute, Bacterial | Abscess formation, severe pain | Bacterial (Staph, Strep) |
| **Silent/Postpartum Thyroiditis** | Subacute, Lymphocytic | Painless, transient toxicity | Autoimmune |

## 1. Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis (Chronic Lymphocytic Thyroiditis)

This is the most common cause of [[hypothyroidism]] in iodine-sufficient areas. It is an autoimmune disorder occurring most frequently in middle-aged women.

### Pathophysiology
*   **Autoimmune Attack:** The body develops antibodies against thyroid antigens, specifically **Anti-Thyroid Peroxidase (Anti-TPO)** and **Anti-Thyroglobulin (Anti-Tg)**.
*   **Histology:** The parenchyma is diffusely infiltrated with lymphocytes. Fibrotic septae extend into the gland.
*   **Follicular Destruction:** Progressive destruction of thyroid follicles leads to hypothyroidism.
*   **Regenerative Nodules:** TSH stimulation (due to low T3/T4) stimulates remaining follicular cells to form nodules, often mimicking a multinodular goiter.

### Clinical Features
*   **Demographics:** Females > Males (ratio 10:1 to 5:1), typically middle-aged.
*   **Goiter:** Usually presents as a diffuse, firm, rubbery, painless enlargement of the thyroid. Can be nodular.
*   **Hypothyroidism symptoms:** Fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, dry skin, constipation, menorrhagia, and hoarseness.
*   **Associated Conditions:** Vitiligo, Pernicious anemia, Type 1 Diabetes.

### Diagnosis
*   **Thyroid Function Tests (TFTs):** Elevated [[TSH]], low T3 and T4.
*   **Antibody Titers:**
    *   **Anti-TPO (Antimicrosomal) antibodies:** Present in nearly 100% of cases.
    *   Anti-Thyroglobulin antibodies.
*   **FNAC (Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology):**
    *   Shows lymphocytic infiltration.
    *   Presence of **Hurthle cells** (Askanazy cells).
    *   *Note:* The Bethesda system categorizes FNAC results; Hashimoto's may present as benign or with atypia.
*   **Ultrasound:** Diffuse enlargement with multiple ill-defined foci of hypoechogenicity and increased vascularity. It is often difficult to differentiate from Graves' disease purely on ultrasound.

### Management
*   **Medical:** Levothyroxine ([[T4]]) replacement therapy to normalize TSH levels.
*   **Surgical:** Indicated only for cosmetic reasons (large goiter) or pressure symptoms.

> **Clinical Implication:** Patients with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis have an **80-times higher incidence** of developing [[Thyroid Lymphoma]] (specifically B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma). Any rapid enlargement of a long-standing goiter in a Hashimoto's patient warrants investigation for lymphoma or [[Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma]].

## 2. De Quervain’s Thyroiditis (Subacute Granulomatous Thyroiditis)

Also known as Giant Cell Thyroiditis. It is a self-limiting inflammatory condition.

### Etiology
*   Likely viral in origin (e.g., mumps, influenza, adenovirus) or post-viral response.

### Clinical Features
*   **Pain:** The hallmark is a **painful**, tender goiter. Pain often radiates to the ear or jaw.
*   **Systemic Symptoms:** Fever, malaise, myalgia.
*   **Triphasic Course:**
    1.  **Initial Hyperthyroidism:** Due to destruction of follicles and release of stored hormones (leakage).
    2.  **Transient Hypothyroidism:** Due to depleted stores and suppressed TSH.
    3.  **Euthyroidism:** Recovery phase.

### Diagnosis
*   **ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate):** Markedly elevated (>50–100 mm/hr).
*   **Thyroid Scan (RAIU):** **Low uptake** (Cold gland) despite high serum T3/T4 levels (this distinguishes it from Graves' disease where uptake is high).
*   **FNAC:** Multinucleated giant cells and granulomas.

### Treatment
*   **Symptomatic:** NSAIDs (Aspirin/Naproxen) for pain.
*   **Severe Cases:** Corticosteroids (Prednisolone) provide dramatic relief.
*   **Beta-blockers:** To control thyrotoxic symptoms (palpitations/tremors).
*   *Note:* Antithyroid drugs (Methimazole) are **not** effective as the hyperthyroidism is due to leakage, not overproduction.

**Mnemonic:** De **Q**uerv**ain** = associated with **Pain**.

## 3. Riedel’s Thyroiditis (Invasive Fibrous Thyroiditis)

A rare, chronic inflammatory disease resulting in extensive fibrosis.

### Pathology
*   Replacement of normal thyroid parenchyma by dense fibrous tissue.
*   Fibrosis extends **beyond the capsule** into surrounding neck structures (strap muscles, trachea, esophagus, carotid sheath).
*   Often associated with systemic fibrosing conditions (e.g., Retroperitoneal fibrosis).

### Clinical Features
*   **Hard Goiter:** "Stony hard" or "Woody" consistency.
*   **Fixity:** The gland is fixed to surrounding structures, clinically mimicking [[Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma]].
*   **Pressure Symptoms:** Dyspnea (tracheal compression), Dysphagia (esophageal compression), Hoarseness (Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve involvement).
*   Usually euthyroid or hypothyroid.

### Diagnosis
*   **Open Biopsy:** Often required to differentiate from carcinoma (wedge biopsy). FNAC is often inconclusive (dry tap or just fibrous tissue).

### Treatment
*   **Medical:** Corticosteroids or Tamoxifen (anti-estrogen) may help in early stages.
*   **Surgical:** **Isthmusectomy** or wedge resection to relieve tracheal compression. Total thyroidectomy is often impossible and dangerous due to loss of tissue planes and risk to the [[Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve]].

## 4. Acute Suppurative Thyroiditis

Rare infection of the thyroid gland, as the thyroid is resistant to infection due to its high iodine content and vascularity.

### Etiology
*   **Bacterial:** Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes.
*   **Route:** Hematogenous or direct extension (e.g., from a **Pyriform Fossa Fistula** in children).

### Clinical Features
*   Sudden onset of severe pain, heat, redness, and swelling over the thyroid.
*   High-grade fever, chills, and dysphagia.
*   Abscess formation.

### Management
*   **Antibiotics:** IV broad-spectrum antibiotics.
*   **Drainage:** Incision and drainage if abscess forms.
*   **Investigation:** Barium swallow or CT to rule out pyriform sinus fistula (especially in recurrent cases in children).
