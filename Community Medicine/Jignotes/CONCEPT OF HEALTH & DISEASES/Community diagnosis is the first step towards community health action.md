# [[CONCEPT OF HEALTH & DISEASES]] > Community diagnosis is the first step towards community health action

### Community Diagnosis: The Foundation of Health Action

**Community Diagnosis** refers to the identification and quantification of health problems in a community in terms of mortality and morbidity rates and ratios, and the identification of their correlates for the purpose of defining those individuals or groups at risk or those in need of health care,. Just as a clinical diagnosis is necessary before treating an individual patient, **Community Diagnosis** is the essential first step before initiating any [[Community Health Action]] (or Community Treatment).

It provides the baseline data required to plan, implement, and evaluate health services.

#### **Comparison: Clinical vs. Community Diagnosis**

The concept is best understood by comparing the role of a clinician with that of an epidemiologist/community physician,:

| Feature | Clinical Diagnosis (Individual) | Community Diagnosis (Population) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Object of Study** | The Individual Patient | The [[Defined Population]] or Community |
| **Tool Used** | Clinical skills (Stethoscope, Thermometer) | [[Epidemiology]] and Biostatistics |
| **Diagnosis Basis** | Signs and Symptoms | Statistical indicators (Mortality, Morbidity) |
| **Goal** | Prescribe specific treatment for the person | Plan and prioritize health services for the group |
| **Outcome** | Cure / Relief / Rehabilitation | Reduction in Disease frequency / Health Promotion |

#### **Basis of Community Diagnosis**
To arrive at a community diagnosis, a doctor must collect and interpret relevant data regarding:
1.  **Demography:** Age and sex distribution, distribution by social groups.
2.  **[[Vital Statistics]]:** Birth rates, death rates.
3.  **Morbidity:** Incidence and prevalence of important diseases in the area.
4.  **Socio-economic factors:** Cultural beliefs, economic status, and environment.

#### **Objectives of Community Diagnosis**
The primary aims are,:
*   **Identification:** To identify the basic health needs and problems.
*   **Quantification:** To measure the magnitude of the disease load (morbidity/mortality).
*   **Prioritization:** To lay down priorities for disease control and prevention based on the magnitude of the problem.
*   **Risk Assessment:** To identify "high-risk groups" or individuals in need of care.
*   **Baseline:** To serve as a benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of health services at a later date.

### **Steps in Community Diagnosis**

The process follows a logical sequence similar to managing a patient.

**Mnemonic: "Lots of Examiners Say That The First Impression is Really Important"**

1.  **L**isten to people/population.
2.  **O**bservations on community.
3.  **E**xamination of community (Review of records).
4.  **S**urvey investigation of community.
5.  **T**entative diagnosis.
6.  **T**reatment of community ([[Community Health Action]]).
7.  **F**ollow-up of community.
8.  **I**ntervention evaluation.
9.  **R**e-planning of services.
10. **I**mprovement of services.

#### **Types of Problems Identified**
Through community surveys and diagnosis, problems are categorized as:
*   **Direct Health Problems:** e.g., [[Tuberculosis]], Hypertension.
*   **Indirect Health Problems:** e.g., Lack of safe water, insanitation.
*   **Health Related Problems:** e.g., Poverty, Unemployment.
*   **Service Related Problems:** e.g., Inadequate drug supply at the [[Primary Health Centre]].

### **Community Treatment (Community Health Action)**

Once the diagnosis is established and priorities are set, the next step is **Community Treatment**. This is the sum of steps decided upon to meet the health needs of the community, taking into account available resources and the wishes of the people.

**Characteristics of Community Health Action:**
*   **Utilization of Resources:** Must effectively use available men, money, and material.
*   **Intersectoral Coordination:** Coordinating efforts of all agencies (agriculture, education, etc.).
*   **Community Participation:** Encouraging full participation of the people in the program.

**Examples of Action:**
*   Improvement of water supplies.
*   [[Immunization]] drives.
*   Health education campaigns.
*   Control of specific diseases (e.g., Malaria, TB).
*   Health legislation.

### **Clinical Relevance**
*   **For the Medical Officer:** When a doctor takes charge of a [[Primary Health Centre]], they must first perform a community diagnosis to understand the "pattern of disease" in their catchment area before ordering drugs or planning camps.
*   **For Resource Allocation:** Without a proper diagnosis, scarce resources might be wasted on diseases that have low prevalence in that specific area, while major killers are ignored.
