# [[Ludwig's Angina]]

**Definition**
[[Ludwig's Angina]] is a rapidly spreading, firm, acute **cellulitis** (not an abscess) of the submandibular space. It is a potentially life-threatening condition due to the risk of upper airway obstruction. It is characterized by brawny induration and involves the tissues of the floor of the mouth bilaterally.

**Anatomical Basis**
*   **Space Involved:** [[Submandibular space]].
*   **Compartments:** The space is divided by the [[Mylohyoid muscle]] (oral diaphragm) into two intercommunicating compartments:
    *   **[[Sublingual space]]:** Superior to the mylohyoid muscle.
    *   **[[Submaxillary space]]:** Inferior to the mylohyoid muscle.
*   **Communication:** These spaces communicate with each other around the posterior border of the mylohyoid muscle.
*   **Path of Spread:** Infection usually starts in the submaxillary space and rapidly spreads to the sublingual space (or vice versa), eventually involving the entire submandibular space bilaterally.

**Etiology**
*   **Odontogenic Infections (80% of cases):** Most common cause.
    *   **2nd and 3rd Lower Molars:** The roots of these teeth extend *below* the [[Mylohyoid line]]. Infection here spreads directly into the [[Submaxillary space]].
    *   **Premolars:** Roots lie *above* the mylohyoid line; infection spreads to the [[Sublingual space]].
*   **Other Causes:**
    *   Trauma to the floor of the mouth.
    *   Fractures of the mandible.
    *   [[Sialadenitis]] (Submandibular gland infection).
    *   Infected malignancies.
    *   [[Lingual tonsillitis]].
*   **Predisposing Factors:** [[Diabetes Mellitus]], immunocompromised states (HIV), malnutrition.

**Microbiology**
It is usually a polymicrobial infection involving both aerobes and anaerobes.
*   **Aerobes:** Alpha-hemolytic *Streptococci*, *Staphylococci*.
*   **Anaerobes:** *Bacteroides*, *Peptostreptococcus*, *Fusobacterium*.

**Clinical Features**
The condition is characterized by rapid progression.

### Symptoms
*   **Pain:** Severe pain in the floor of the mouth and neck.
*   **Dysphagia:** Difficulty swallowing.
*   **[[Odynophagia]]:** Painful swallowing.
*   **Dyspnea/Stridor:** Due to airway compromise.
*   **Hot Potato Voice:** Muffled speech.
*   **Drooling:** Due to inability to swallow saliva.

### Signs
*   **Brawny Edema:** Woody, hard, board-like swelling in the submandibular and submental regions. It is **non-fluctuant** initially (cellulitis) and very tender.
*   **Raised Floor of Mouth:** The floor of the mouth is congested, edematous, and elevated.
*   **Tongue Position:** The tongue is pushed **upwards and backwards**, which is the primary cause of airway obstruction.
*   **[[Trismus]]:** Difficulty opening the mouth due to involvement of the medial pterygoid and masseter muscles.
*   **Open Mouth:** Patient often keeps mouth open and sits leaning forward to breathe.
*   **Systemic Signs:** High fever, tachycardia, toxic appearance.

**Diagnostic Criteria (Grodinsky and Holyoke/Goldring’s Criteria)**
1.  It is a **cellulitis**, not an abscess (little to no frank pus).
2.  It is always **bilateral**.
3.  It involves both superficial and deep fascial planes (sublingual and submaxillary).
4.  It spreads by continuity, not lymphatics.
5.  It does not involve the salivary glands initially.

**Investigations**
*   **Diagnosis:** Primarily clinical.
*   **[[CT Scan]] (Contrast-enhanced):** Gold standard to assess the extent of infection, airway patency, and rule out frank abscess formation or spread to mediastinum.
*   **Panoramic X-ray (OPG):** To identify the dental source (apical abscess).
*   **Culture sensitivity:** From the drainage fluid.

**Management**
This is a medical emergency.

### 1. Airway Management (Priority #1)
*   The airway is threatened by laryngeal edema and the tongue being displaced posteriorly.
*   **Observation:** Close monitoring in ICU.
*   **[[Tracheostomy]]:** Often required under local anesthesia if stridor is present. It is the safest way to secure the airway in advanced cases.
*   **Intubation:** Orotracheal/Nasotracheal intubation is difficult and hazardous due to trismus, edema, and distorted anatomy ("Can't intubate, Can't ventilate" scenario). Fiberoptic intubation may be attempted if the airway is still patent.

### 2. Medical Treatment
*   **Antibiotics:** High-dose IV antibiotics covering aerobes and anaerobes (e.g., Ceftriaxone + Metronidazole, or Clindamycin, or Piperacillin-Tazobactam).
*   **Steroids:** IV Dexamethasone/Hydrocortisone to reduce edema (controversial but widely used).
*   **Hydration:** IV fluids to correct dehydration.

### 3. Surgical Decompression (Incision and Drainage)
*   **Indication:** Even if frank pus is not formed, surgery is done to release tension (decompression).
*   **Incision:** A wide transverse incision is made from one angle of the mandible to the other (collar incision).
*   **Dissection:** Blunt dissection is carried out through the mylohyoid muscle to connect the sublingual and submaxillary spaces.
*   **Drain:** Corrugated rubber drains are placed.
*   **Result:** Usually yields serosanguinous fluid (edema fluid) rather than frank pus.

**Complications**
*   **Asphyxia:** Sudden airway obstruction (Most common cause of death).
*   **[[Mediastinitis]]:** Spread of infection via the parapharyngeal and retropharyngeal spaces ("Lincoln's Highway") to the mediastinum.
*   **Aspiration Pneumonia.**
*   **Septicemia/Sepsis.**
*   **Carotid Artery Erosion:** Rare.

**Differential Diagnosis**
*   Submandibular lymphadenitis.
*   Infected submandibular salivary gland.
*   Angioneurotic edema.
*   Abscess of lymph nodes.

**Clinical Implications**
*   **[[Dental Caries]]:** Always examine the teeth, especially lower molars, in patients with neck swelling.
*   **Tracheostomy:** Never hesitate to perform an early tracheostomy in Ludwig's angina; waiting for stridor may be fatal.
