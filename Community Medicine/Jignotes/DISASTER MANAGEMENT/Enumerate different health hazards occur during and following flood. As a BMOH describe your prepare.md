# [[DISASTER MANAGEMENT]] > Enumerate different health hazards occur during and following flood. As a BMOH describe your preparedness plan to mitigate such hazards in future.

### Health Hazards Occurring During and Following Floods

The health consequences of floods can be broadly categorized into immediate effects and delayed effects (occurring days to weeks later).

#### 1. Direct Impact and Immediate Hazards
*   **Drowning and Injuries:** The most immediate cause of death is drowning. Injuries occur due to collapse of houses, standing structures, or debris in the water,,.
*   **Hypothermia:** Exposure to cold floodwaters can lead to accidental hypothermia.
*   **Animal and Insect Bites:** As floodwaters enter holes and burrows, snakes and other insects are displaced, leading to an increased incidence of [[Snake Bites]] and insect stings.

#### 2. Water-Borne and Food-Borne Diseases (Communicable Diseases)
*   *Cause:* Non-availability or contamination of safe drinking water and damage to sanitation facilities,.
*   **Diarrheal Diseases:** Acute gastroenteritis is the most commonly reported disease in the post-disaster phase. Cholera, dysentery, and rotavirus infections are common,.
*   **Enteric Fevers:** Typhoid and paratyphoid fever outbreaks may occur due to sewage contamination.
*   **Viral Hepatitis:** Specifically **[[Hepatitis A]]** and **[[Hepatitis E]]** (feco-oral transmission) often appear a few weeks after the flood.

#### 3. Vector-Borne Diseases
*   *Cause:* Stagnant water creates breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
*   **Malaria and Filaria:** Cases typically increase 10–15 days after flooding due to increased mosquito breeding,.
*   **Dengue:** Outbreaks may occur if artificial water collections increase.

#### 4. Zoonotic Diseases
*   **[[Leptospirosis]]:** This is a significant risk following floods (e.g., epidemics in Odisha and Mumbai). It spreads through contact with water contaminated by the urine of infected rodents/animals,.

#### 5. Skin and Respiratory Infections
*   **Respiratory Infections:** Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) rise due to overcrowding in temporary shelters and exposure to adverse climatic conditions,.
*   **Skin Diseases:** Scabies and fungal infections occur due to poor personal hygiene and constant contact with dirty water.

#### 6. Psychological and Nutritional Hazards
*   **Psychological Manifestations:** Anxiety, neurosis, depression, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) due to loss of property and loved ones.
*   **Nutritional Deficiencies:** Disruption of food supply chains can lead to starvation and vitamin deficiencies (specifically [[Vitamin A]] deficiency) in vulnerable groups like children.

### Preparedness Plan for Mitigation (As a BMOH)

As a Block Medical Officer of Health (BMOH), the focus is on **Disaster Preparedness** and **Mitigation** to minimize future impact.

#### 1. Risk Assessment and Mapping
*   **Identify High-Risk Areas:** Map low-lying areas and villages prone to waterlogging within the block.
*   **Vulnerable Population Listing:** Maintain an updated list of pregnant women (EDD within 1 month), infants, elderly, and disabled persons for priority evacuation.

#### 2. Strengthening Health Infrastructure (Mitigation)
*   **Structural Safety:** Ensure PHCs and Sub-centers in flood-prone zones have raised plinths and waterproofing to remain functional during floods.
*   **Alternative Power/Water:** Ensure backup generators and raised hand-pumps (sanitary wells) are available at health facilities,.

#### 3. Resource Mobilization and Logistics
*   **Buffer Stock:** Pre-position essential medicines and supplies before the monsoon season:
    *   **Chlorine tablets/Bleaching powder** for water disinfection,.
    *   **ORS and IV fluids** for dehydration management.
    *   **Anti-snake venom (ASV)** and Anti-rabies vaccines,.
    *   Insecticides (DDT/Malathion) for vector control.

#### 4. Capacity Building and Training
*   **Rapid Response Teams (RRT):** Form and train block-level RRTs comprising doctors, epidemiologists, and paramedics for outbreak investigation.
*   **Skill Training:** Train health workers (ANMs/ASHAs) in [[Triage]] protocols and first aid for drowning and trauma.

#### 5. Water and Sanitation Management
*   **Water Quality Surveillance:** Plan for regular testing of water sources. Equip health workers with **Horrock’s apparatus** to determine chlorine demand.
*   **Disinfection Plan:** Ensure a plan is in place to maintain a residual chlorine level of **>0.7 mg/L** in drinking water sources immediately post-disaster.

#### 6. Information, Education, and Communication (IEC)
*   Conduct community awareness programs *before* the flood season focusing on:
    *   **Hygiene:** Hand washing and use of toilets.
    *   **Water Safety:** Drinking only boiled or chlorinated water.
    *   **Nutrition:** Storing dry food rations.
    *   **Dos and Don'ts:** Avoiding wading through stagnant water (to prevent Leptospirosis).

#### 7. Inter-Sectoral Coordination
*   Coordinate with the Block Development Officer (BDO), Public Health Engineering Department (PHED), and Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) for safe water supply, carcass disposal, and vector control measures.

### Clinical Relevance: Leptospirosis
In flood situations, a patient presenting with fever, myalgia (specifically calf tenderness), and jaundice should be suspected for **[[Leptospirosis]]**. Early treatment with **Doxycycline** can prevent complications like Weil's disease (renal/hepatic failure). Doxycycline is also used for chemoprophylaxis in high-risk groups (e.g., rescue workers wading in water).

### Mnemonic for Post-Flood Diseases: **"WAVES"**
*   **W**ater-borne (Cholera, Typhoid, Hep A/E)
*   **A**ccidents & Animals (Snake bites, Injuries)
*   **V**ector-borne (Malaria, Dengue)
*   **E**motional stress (PTSD, Anxiety)
*   **S**kin & Respiratory infections
