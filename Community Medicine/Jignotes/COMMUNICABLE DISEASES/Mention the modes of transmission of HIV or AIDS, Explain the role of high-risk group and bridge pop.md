# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Mention the modes of transmission of HIV or AIDS, Explain the role of high-risk group and bridge population in HIV transmission, Outline the strategies undertaken in national program to reduce transmission from high-risk group.

### 1. Modes of Transmission of HIV/AIDS

[[Human Immunodeficiency Virus]] (HIV) is transmitted primarily through specific body fluids: blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and breast milk. It is **not** transmitted by casual contact, mosquitoes, water, or food,,.

The basic modes of transmission are:

**A. Sexual Transmission (Most Common)**
*   **Mechanism:** Unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex with an infected partner.
*   **Risk Factors:**
    *   **Anal intercourse** carries the highest risk due to mucosal trauma,.
    *   Presence of other [[Sexually Transmitted Diseases]] (STDs), especially ulcerative ones (e.g., Syphilis, Chancroid), increases transmission risk by **8–10 times**,.
    *   Higher viral load in the partner (e.g., during the "window period" or late-stage AIDS) increases infectivity.
*   **Statistics:** Accounts for approximately **86–87%** of infections in India,.

**B. Blood and Blood Products (Most Efficient)**
*   **Mechanism:** Transfusion of infected whole blood, platelets, or factors (VIII, IX).
*   **Efficiency:** Highest efficiency (**>90–95% risk** after a single exposure),.
*   **Current Status:** Due to mandatory screening, this route now contributes very little to total cases (<1%).

**C. Parenteral Transmission (Needles and Syringes)**
*   **Mechanism:** Sharing contaminated needles among [[Injecting Drug Users]] (IDUs) or accidental needle stick injuries in healthcare settings.
*   **Risk:** Needle stick injury carries a risk of approx **0.3%**,.

**D. Maternal-Foetal Transmission (Vertical Transmission)**
*   **Mechanism:** From an infected mother to the child during pregnancy (transplacental), during delivery (intrapartum), or through **breastfeeding**.
*   **Risk:** Without intervention, the rate is 20–30% (up to 45% with breastfeeding). With specific interventions (PPTCT), this can be reduced significantly,.

> **Clinical Relevance:** **Window Period** is the time between infection and the detection of antibodies (usually 2–12 weeks). During this time, the person is highly infectious but tests negative on standard antibody tests,.

| Route | Efficiency (Risk per exposure) | % Contribution to Cases (India) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Blood Transfusion** | > 90–95% (Highest) | ~1% |
| **Sexual** | 0.01 – 1% | ~86–87% (Highest Burden) |
| **Mother to Child** | 30% (without Rx) | ~5% |
| **Sharing Needles** | 0.3% | ~2% |

### 2. Role of High-Risk Groups and Bridge Population

In India, the HIV epidemic is defined as a **concentrated epidemic**, meaning prevalence is high in specific groups but low in the general population,. The transmission dynamics follow a **Type 4 Pattern**.

#### **A. High-Risk Groups (Core Group)**
These groups act as **reservoirs** of infection due to high-risk behaviors.
*   **Who are they?**
    *   **FSWs:** Female Sex Workers.
    *   **MSM:** Men who have Sex with Men.
    *   **IDUs:** Injecting Drug Users.
    *   **Transgenders/Hijras**.
*   **Role in Transmission:** The epidemic starts here. They have the highest prevalence rates (e.g., IDUs in North-East India) and maintain the infection within their networks through multi-partner sex or needle sharing,.

#### **B. Bridge Population**
These populations act as a "bridge" or link between the high-risk groups and the general low-risk population.
*   **Who are they?**
    *   **Truckers:** Long-distance truck drivers.
    *   **Migrant Workers:** Single male migrants.
*   **Role in Transmission:**
    1.  They contract HIV through interaction with Core Groups (e.g., a trucker visiting a sex worker).
    2.  They return to their families/homes.
    3.  They transmit the virus to their spouses or regular partners (General Population) who otherwise have no risk behavior.
    *   *Without the bridge population, the epidemic would likely remain contained within the high-risk groups*,.

> Draw a flow chart showing three boxes. Box 1 "Core Group (FSW/MSM/IDU)" with arrow pointing to Box 2 "Bridge Population (Truckers/Migrants)" with arrow pointing to Box 3 "General Population (Spouses/Children)". Label the arrow between 1 and 2 as "High Risk Behavior" and arrow between 2 and 3 as "Spousal Transmission".

### 3. Strategies to Reduce Transmission from High-Risk Groups

The [[National AIDS Control Programme]] (NACP) focuses heavily on **Targeted Interventions (TI)** to saturate coverage among high-risk groups (HRGs) to halt the epidemic,.

**A. Targeted Interventions (TI)**
These are specific projects tailored to the needs of HRGs. The main components are:
*   **Behavior Change Communication (BCC):** Peer-led counseling to adopt safe practices.
*   **Condom Promotion:** Distribution of free condoms and social marketing to ensure 100% usage during sexual encounters.
*   **STI Management:** Syndromic management of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) to reduce the risk of HIV transmission (since STIs facilitate HIV entry).
*   **Enabling Environment:** Reducing stigma, mobilizing communities, and involving NGOs/CBOs so HRGs can access services without fear,.

**B. Specific Strategies for Injecting Drug Users (IDUs)**
*   **Opioid Substitution Therapy ([[OST]]):** Replacing illicit drugs with medically prescribed substitutes (like Buprenorphine) to reduce injecting frequency.
*   **Needle-Syringe Exchange Program ([[NSEP]]):** Providing clean needles to prevent sharing.

**C. Link Worker Scheme**
*   **Objective:** To reach HRGs and vulnerable populations in **rural areas** where formal TIs might not reach.
*   **Action:** Link workers provide condoms, information, and referrals to [[ICTC]] (Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres),.

**D. Integrated Counselling and Testing**
*   Promoting **Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT)** among HRGs to ensure they know their status.
*   **"Test and Treat":** All diagnosed HIV+ individuals are put on [[ART]] (Antiretroviral Therapy) immediately, which reduces their viral load and makes them less infectious to others (Treatment as Prevention).

### **Mnemonic for Targeted Interventions: "ABC-DE"**
*   **A**ccess to services (STI clinics, ICTC)
*   **B**ehavior Change Communication (BCC)
*   **C**ondom promotion
*   **D**rug substitution (OST for IDUs) / **D**iagnosis of STIs
*   **E**nabling Environment
