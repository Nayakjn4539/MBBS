# [[Larynx]] > Laryngomalacia and Congenital Webs

# Laryngomalacia

**Laryngomalacia** (Congenital Laryngeal Stridor) is the most common congenital anomaly of the [[larynx]] and the most common cause of stridor in infants and children.

### The Defect
*   **Pathophysiology:** It is characterized by excessive flaccidity of the [[supraglottic larynx]] due to delayed calcium deposition or weakness of the neuromuscular control.
*   **Anatomical Abnormalities:**
    *   Elongated, tubular, or **Omega-shaped (Ω) [[epiglottis]]** that curls upon itself.
    *   Short and floppy [[aryepiglottic folds]].
    *   Prominent/large [[arytenoids]] with redundant overlying mucosa.
*   **Mechanism:** Due to the flaccidity, the supraglottic structures are sucked inward (prolapse) into the laryngeal inlet during inspiration (Bernoulli effect), causing airway obstruction and stridor.

### Physiological Effects and Clinical Features
Symptoms usually appear at birth or within the first few weeks of life, peak at 6 months, and typically resolve by 18–24 months.

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Stridor** | **Inspiratory**, low-pitched, musical, or croaking in nature. |
| **Cry** | **Normal cry** (This is a crucial differentiating feature from [[laryngeal web]] or [[vocal cord palsy]]). |
| **Positional Variation** | Stridor **worsens** in the **supine position** (lying on back).<br>Stridor **improves/disappears** in the **prone position** (lying on stomach) as redundant tissue falls forward. |
| **Aggravating Factors** | Crying, feeding, exertion, and agitation increase the stridor. |
| **Associated Conditions** | High prevalence of [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD) (50–100%) and synchronous airway lesions. |
| **Severe Cases** | Feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, choking, cyanosis, and chest retraction. |

**Mnemonic: L-M-N-O-P**
*   **L**aryngomalacia
*   **M**ost common cause of stridor
*   **N**ormal Cry
*   **O**mega shaped epiglottis
*   **P**rone position improves symptoms

### Diagnosis
1.  **History:** Inspiratory stridor starting shortly after birth, normal cry, positional variation.
2.  **Flexible Fiberoptic Laryngoscopy (FFL):**
    *   **Gold Standard** for diagnosis in the OPD/clinic.
    *   Done awake to assess dynamic airway collapse.
    *   **Findings:** Omega-shaped epiglottis, short aryepiglottic folds, prolapse of arytenoid mucosa anteriorly during inspiration.
3.  **Direct Laryngoscopy (DL):**
    *   Usually shows an exaggerated infantile type of larynx.
    *   The inlet may have a typical **"Cruciate" appearance**.
    *   Performed to rule out synchronous lesions (e.g., [[subglottic stenosis]]).

### Management
**A. Conservative (Observation)**
*   **Indication:** 90% of cases. Mild cases with normal weight gain and no significant distress.
*   **Prognosis:** The condition is self-limiting. As the laryngeal cartilages stiffen and the larynx grows, symptoms usually disappear by **2 years of age**.
*   **Medical Therapy:** Anti-reflux medication (PPIs) if [[GERD]] is present.

**B. Surgical Intervention**
*   **Indications (Severe Laryngomalacia - approx. 10%):**
    *   Failure to thrive (poor weight gain due to feeding difficulty).
    *   Severe respiratory distress/apneic spells/cyanosis.
    *   [[Cor pulmonale]] (rare) due to chronic hypoxia.
*   **Procedure:** **[[Supraglottoplasty]]** (also called Aryepiglottoplasty).
    *   Involves trimming the short aryepiglottic folds and excising redundant mucosa over the arytenoids using cold steel instruments, CO2 laser, or microdebrider.
    *   **Goal:** To widen the laryngeal inlet.
*   **Tracheostomy:** Rarely needed, reserved for life-threatening cases where supraglottoplasty fails or multiple comorbidities exist.

# Congenital Laryngeal Webs

**Congenital Laryngeal Web** is a rare anomaly caused by the failure of the [[larynx]] to recanalize during embryonic development.

### The Defect
*   **Embryology:** The laryngeal lumen is obliterated by epithelial proliferation during the 8th week. Recanalization occurs by the **10th week**. Failure of this recanalization leads to web formation or, in severe cases, [[laryngeal atresia]].
*   **Location:** 75% occur in the **[[glottis]]** (at the level of vocal cords). Most are located **anteriorly**.
*   **Pathology:** Can be a thin membranous sheet or a thick fibrous wedge. Usually has a concave posterior margin.

### Physiological Effects and Symptoms
Symptoms depend on the thickness and extent of the web.

| Symptom | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Weak Cry / Aphonia** | **Cardinal Symptom.** Unlike laryngomalacia, the voice is affected because the pathology involves the [[true vocal cords]]. |
| **Stridor** | If the web is large, causing obstruction. Can be inspiratory or biphasic. |
| **Respiratory Distress** | In severe cases with thick webs. |
| **Recurrent Croup** | Some children present later with recurrent upper respiratory infections masquerading as croup. |

**Clinical Implication:** Any infant with a **weak or hoarse cry** at birth should be suspected of having a glottic anomaly, such as a web or vocal cord palsy.

### Diagnosis
1.  **Flexible/Rigid Endoscopy:** Visualization of a web connecting the vocal cords anteriorly.
2.  **Lateral X-ray Neck:** May show the web.
3.  **Genetic Screening:** Associated with **Velo-cardio-facial syndrome (22q11 deletion)**.

### Management
Treatment depends on the thickness and severity of the web.

1.  **Observation:** Small, thin anterior webs causing no symptoms may not require treatment.
2.  **Surgical Division (For thin webs):**
    *   Endoscopic division using a knife (cold steel) or **CO2 Laser**.
    *   Simple division may lead to recurrence due to fusion of raw surfaces.
3.  **Laryngofissure / Open Approach (For thick webs):**
    *   Excision of the web via an external incision (laryngofissure).
    *   **[[Laryngeal Keel]] Insertion:** A silastic sheet (keel) is placed between the vocal cords to prevent re-adhesion (synechiae) during the healing process.
    *   The keel is removed endoscopically after 2–4 weeks once epithelialization is complete.
4.  **Tracheostomy:** May be required initially if there is severe respiratory obstruction.

| **Cry** | **Normal** | **Weak / Hoarse / Aphonic** |
| **Stridor** | Inspiratory (position dependent) | Inspiratory or Biphasic |
| **Pathology** | Floppy tissues, Omega epiglottis | Failure of recanalization |
| **Primary Rx** | Observation (Surgery if severe) | Surgical division + Keel |
