# [[Identification]] > Scars, Tattoos and Occupational Marks

### **Scars**

**Definition**
A [[scar]] (Cicatrix) is a permanent fibrous tissue replacement resulting from the healing of a wound involving the loss of substance of the true skin ([[dermis]]).
*   **Key Feature:** Scars are devoid of hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, and pigment. They are covered by epithelium.
*   **Note:** Superficial injuries involving only the epidermis heal without scarring.

**Classification of Scars**
1.  **Traumatic Scars:** Result from mechanical injuries.
    *   **Incised wounds:** Linear scars.
    *   **Lacerated wounds:** Irregular, broad, and thick scars.
    *   **Stab wounds:** Oval, elliptical, or triangular scars.
    *   **Bullet wounds:** Circular, depressed, and puckered scars.
2.  **Thermal Scars:**
    *   **Burns:** Irregular, large, keloid formation common.
    *   **Scalds:** Stippled or splashed appearance.
    *   **Corrosives:** Thin, parchment-like, or hypertrophic.
3.  **Surgical Scars:** Linear with regular stitch marks on either side (railroad track appearance).
4.  **Pathological Scars:** Resulting from diseases like smallpox, syphilis, chickenpox (pitted scars), tuberculosis (irregular, puckered).
5.  **Physiological Scars:** [[Linea albicantes]] (Striae gravidarum) on the abdomen/thighs indicating previous pregnancy or obesity.
6.  **Vaccination Scars:** Circular, flat, or slightly depressed, usually on the deltoid region (left arm).

**Age of Scars**
Estimating the age of a scar is crucial for linking it to a specific alleged incident.

| Time Since Injury | Appearance of Scar |
| :--- | :--- |
| **First few days** | Red, tender, soft, covered by a scab. |
| **1–2 weeks** | Tender, reddish, vascular. |
| **2–6 months** | Redness fades, becomes brownish (pigmented). |
| **6 months onwards** | Becomes paler, whitish, glistening (pearly white). |
| **Years** | Contracted, firm, tough. |

**Important Note:** The time frames are approximate and vary based on vascularity, infection, and individual healing capacity. Scars generally assume a permanent character (white and glistening) after **6 months**.

**Medicolegal Importance of Scars**
1.  **Identification:** A scar is an excellent secondary identifier. Its site, shape, and size are permanent.
2.  **Nature of Weapon:** The shape of the scar can indicate the causative weapon (e.g., linear for a knife, circular for a bullet).
3.  **Time of Crime:** Establishing the age of the scar helps verify the timeline of an alleged assault.
4.  **Grievous Hurt:**
    *   Scars causing permanent disfiguration of the head or face.
    *   Scars involving joints leading to permanent impairment of motion.
5.  **Evidence of Surgery:** Indicates previous operations (e.g., appendectomy, tubectomy, caesarean section).

### **Tattoo Marks**

**Definition**
[[Tattoo marks]] are designs produced in the skin by making multiple small puncture wounds with needles dipped in coloring matter/dye. To be permanent, the dye must penetrate the **dermis**. If deposited only in the epidermis, it disappears as the skin desquamates.

**Dyes Used in Tattoos**

| Color | Dye/Pigment Used |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Black/Blue** | Carbon (Indian Ink), Gunpowder, Indigo |
| **Red** | Cinnabar (Mercuric sulfide), Vermilion |
| **Blue** | Cobalt, Prussian blue |
| **Green** | Chromium oxide, Chrome green |
| **Yellow** | Cadmium sulfide, Turmeric, Ochre |
| **White** | Titanium oxide, Zinc oxide |

**Mnemonic for Dyes:**
**B**lack **C**arbon
**R**ed **V**ermilion
**B**lue **C**obalt
**G**reen **C**hrome

**Examination of Faded/Latent Tattoos**
Tattoos may fade over time or be deliberately removed. In decomposed bodies, they become visible after the epidermis peels off.
*   **Techniques to visualize:**
    1.  **Ultra-violet light:** Increases contrast.
    2.  **Infra-red photography:** Useful for deeper pigments.
    3.  **Magnifying glass:** To see residual pigment particles.
    4.  **Examination of Regional Lymph Nodes:** This is the **surest method** in decomposed bodies. The pigment is phagocytosed by macrophages and deposited in the draining lymph nodes (e.g., axillary nodes for arm tattoos), remaining there indefinitely.

**Removal of Tattoos**
Criminals often attempt to alter or remove tattoos to hide identity.
1.  **Surgical:** Excision and skin grafting.
2.  **Laser:** Q-switched lasers (vaporize the pigment).
3.  **Chemical:** Application of caustics (acids, zinc chloride, potassium permanganate) to cause sloughing and scarring.
4.  **Electrolysis.**
5.  **Superimposition:** Tattooing a new design over the old one.

**Medicolegal Importance of Tattoos**
1.  **Identification:**
    *   Specific designs (names, initials, symbols) provide strong evidence.
    *   Comparison with antemortem records/photographs.
2.  **Religion/Culture:** Designs may indicate religious beliefs (e.g., 'Om', Cross) or tribal affiliation.
3.  **Drug Abuse:** Drug addicts (IV users) often use tattoos to **conceal needle track marks** (e.g., "turkey skin" appearance).
4.  **Mental State:** Obscene or bizarre tattoos may indicate sexual perversion or psychiatric instability.
5.  **Occupation:** Specific tattoos may indicate a profession (e.g., sailors, gang members).

### **Occupational Marks**

**Definition**
[[Occupational marks]] are physical changes, stains, or callosities on the body resulting from the prolonged practice of a specific trade or occupation. They serve as valuable clues for identification, especially in unknown dead bodies.

**Common Occupational Marks**

| Occupation | Characteristic Mark/Feature |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Clerks/Students** | Callosity on the middle finger (writer's bump). |
| **Tailors** | Puncture marks on the left index finger (needle pricks). |
| **Coal Miners** | bluish-black tattooing on the face/hands from coal dust (Coal dust in lungs - Anthracosis). |
| **Photographers/Dyers** | Stains of chemicals/dyes on fingers. |
| **Manual Laborers** | Hardened palms, callosities on shoulders (from carrying loads). |
| **Violinists** | Callosity/thickening of skin on the left side of the neck/jaw. |
| **Washermen** | Sodden/thickened skin of hands and feet. |
| **Shoemakers** | Depressed sternum (from holding the last against the chest). |
| **Cooks** | Burns/scars on hands. |

**Medicolegal Importance**
1.  **Identification:** Helps in narrowing down the search for the identity of an unknown person (e.g., "The body is likely a manual laborer").
2.  **Lifestyle Habits:** Gives insight into the socioeconomic status and daily habits of the deceased.
