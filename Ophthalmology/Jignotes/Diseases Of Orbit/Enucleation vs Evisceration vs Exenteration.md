# [[Diseases Of Orbit]] > Enucleation vs Evisceration vs Exenteration

### **Comparison Overview: Enucleation vs Evisceration vs Exenteration**

The three major destructive surgeries of the eye differ based on the structures removed and the indications for performance.

| Feature | [[Enucleation]] | [[Evisceration]] | [[Exenteration]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | Removal of the entire **eyeball** along with a portion of the [[optic nerve]]. The extraocular muscles and orbital contents are left behind. | Removal of the **intraocular contents** (uvea, retina, vitreous, lens) leaving behind the [[sclera]]l shell and extraocular muscle attachments. | Removal of the **entire eyeball**, retrobulbar soft tissues, extraocular muscles, and usually the [[periosteum]] of the orbit. |
| **Primary Indication** | [[Intraocular tumors]] (e.g., [[Retinoblastoma]]), [[Sympathetic Ophthalmitis]] risk. | [[Panophthalmitis]], [[Endophthalmitis]], Expulsive hemorrhage. | Malignant orbital tumors, [[Mucormycosis]]. |
| **Contraindication** | [[Panophthalmitis]] (risk of meningitis). | Intraocular malignancy, risk of [[Sympathetic Ophthalmitis]]. | Benign localized tumors. |
| **Cosmetic Result** | Good (with implant), but motility is less than evisceration. | Better (good motility as muscle attachments are preserved). | Poor (requires facial prosthesis or skin grafting). |
| **Risk of Meningitis** | Higher if performed in panophthalmitis (via optic nerve sheath). | Minimal (optic nerve sheath is not opened). | N/A |

### **1. [[Enucleation]]**

**Definition:**
Complete excision of the eyeball including the sclera and a stump of the optic nerve. The [[Tenon's capsule]] and conjunctiva are preserved.

**Indications:**
*   **Absolute Indications:**
    *   [[Retinoblastoma]] (especially Group E or massive tumors).
    *   [[Malignant Melanoma]] of the choroid or ciliary body.
*   **Relative Indications:**
    *   **Painful Blind Eye:** e.g., in absolute [[glaucoma]].
    *   **Severe Trauma:** Mutilating ocular injury where the globe cannot be salvaged.
    *   **Prevention of Sympathetic Ophthalmitis:** Must be done within 2 weeks of injury to the exciting eye.
    *   **Phthisis Bulbi** or Microphthalmia.
    *   **Eye Donation:** Removal of eyes from a cadaver.

**Contraindications:**
*   [[Panophthalmitis]]: There is a risk of infection spreading to the brain (meningitis) via the cut subarachnoid space of the optic nerve sheath.

**Surgical Highlights:**
*   **Optic Nerve:** In cases of [[Retinoblastoma]], a long stump of the optic nerve (>10 mm) must be excised to check for retrolaminar invasion.
*   **Implants:** An orbital implant (PMMA, Medpor, or Hydroxyapatite) is usually inserted into the muscle cone and sutured to the rectus muscles to improve cosmetic appearance and motility of the artificial eye.

**Clinical Implication:**
> In [[Retinoblastoma]], enucleation is the treatment of choice for Group E tumors or when the tumor occupies >50% of the globe, involves the optic nerve, or causes neovascular glaucoma.

### **2. [[Evisceration]]**

**Definition:**
Removal of the entire intraocular contents, leaving the [[sclera]] and extraocular muscle attachments intact. Often performed as **Frill Evisceration**, where only a 3 mm frill of sclera is left around the optic nerve.

**Indications:**
*   **[[Panophthalmitis]]**: To remove pus and infected contents without opening the optic nerve sheath.
*   **[[Endophthalmitis]]**: Unresponsive to medical/vitrectomy management with no light perception.
*   **Expulsive Choroidal Hemorrhage**: Bleeding that cannot be controlled.
*   **Bleeding Anterior Staphyloma**.

**Contraindications (Absolute):**
1.  **Intraocular Malignancy:** Risk of leaving tumor cells in the scleral emissaria or optic nerve.
2.  **Sympathetic Ophthalmitis Risk:** Leaving uveal tissue behind can incite the immune reaction causing inflammation in the fellow eye.

**Advantages over Enucleation:**
*   Better motility of the prosthesis (muscles remain attached).
*   Less disruption of orbital anatomy.
*   Less risk of intracranial spread of infection in active sepsis.

**Surgical Highlights:**
*   The cornea is excised.
*   Intraocular contents are scooped out using an **evisceration spoon/scoop**.
*   The scleral shell is scrubbed to remove all traces of uveal tissue.

### **3. [[Exenteration]]**

**Definition:**
A mutilating surgery involving the complete removal of the eyeball, retrobulbar orbital soft tissues, extraocular muscles, and usually the [[periosteum]] (periorbita).

**Indications:**
*   **Malignant Orbital Tumors:** e.g., [[Rhabdomyosarcoma]] (recurrence), Lacrimal gland carcinomas.
*   **Intraocular Tumors with Extrascleral Extension:** Retinoblastoma or Melanoma spreading into the orbit.
*   **Skin Tumors:** Squamous cell carcinoma or Basal cell carcinoma invading the orbit deep.
*   **Life-threatening Infections:** Orbital [[Mucormycosis]] (fungal infection common in diabetics/immunocompromised).
*   **Severe Deformities:** Contracted socket or chronic orbital pain.

**Surgical Highlights:**
*   Incision is made along the orbital margins.
*   The periosteum is elevated from the orbital walls.
*   The entire contents are removed in one block.
*   The socket is lined with a split-thickness skin graft or allowed to granulate.

### **Comparison Summary**

| **Parameter** | **Enucleation** | **Evisceration** | **Exenteration** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Extent** | Globe + Optic Nerve stump | Intraocular contents only | Globe + Orbit contents + Periosteum |
| **Sclera** | Removed | Retained | Removed |
| **Muscles** | Detached & Sutured to implant | Left attached to sclera | Removed |
| **Optic Nerve** | Cut | Left intact (covered by sclera) | Cut at apex |
| **Key Use** | Tumors (Rb, Melanoma) | Infection (Panophthalmitis) | Invasive Malignancy / Mucormycosis |
| **Contraindication** | Panophthalmitis | Tumors / Sympathetic Ophthalmia | Benign lesions |

**Mnemonic for Contraindications:**
*   **Evisceration** leaves **E**verything (**S**clera) behind: Don't do it for **S**ympathetic ophthalmia or **T**umors.
*   **Enucleation** opens the **N**erve: Don't do it for **Infection** ([[Panophthalmitis]]).
