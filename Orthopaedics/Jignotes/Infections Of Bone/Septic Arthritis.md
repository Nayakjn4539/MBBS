# Septic Arthritis (Acute Suppurative Arthritis)

[[Septic arthritis]] is a surgical emergency characterized by the invasion of a joint by pathogenic micro-organisms, leading to purulent inflammation. It can result in rapid and irreversible destruction of the articular cartilage and subsequent joint deformity if not treated promptly.

### Etiology and Causative Organisms

The most common causative organism overall is **[[Staphylococcus aureus]]**. However, the pathogen varies by age group and risk factors.

| Group | Common Organism |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Infants (< 2 years)** | *[[Staphylococcus aureus]]*, *[[Haemophilus influenzae]]* (less common now due to vaccination), *Group B Streptococcus* |
| **Children & Adults** | *[[Staphylococcus aureus]]* (Most Common), *Streptococcus pyogenes* |
| **Sexually Active Adults** | *[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]* |
| **IV Drug Abusers** | *[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]*, *Staphylococcus aureus* (often affects [[Sacroiliac joint]], [[Sternoclavicular joint]]) |
| **Sickle Cell Disease** | *[[Salmonella]]* |

### Routes of Infection (The 5 P's)
1.  **P**rimary focus elsewhere (Hematogenous spread - Most Common): From pyoderma, throat infection, umbilicus in neonates.
2.  **P**yogenic [[Osteomyelitis]]: Direct spread from adjacent bone infection (common in joints with intra-articular metaphysis like the hip and shoulder).
3.  **P**unctured wounds: Direct inoculation (e.g., knee joint penetrating injury).
4.  **P**ost-operative/Iatrogenic: Following joint aspirations or surgery.
5.  **P**rimary focus within the joint (Direct invasion).

### Pathogenesis
1.  **Invasion:** Bacteria enter the synovial membrane.
2.  **Inflammation:** Acute synovitis occurs with the formation of a seropurulent exudate (effusion).
3.  **Destruction:** Lysosomal enzymes released by bacteria, inflammatory cells (neutrophils), and the synovium digest the [[articular cartilage]].
    *   **Clinical Implication:** Cartilage destruction can occur within days. "Time is Cartilage."
4.  **Sequelae:** If untreated, the cartilage is destroyed, the subchondral bone is exposed, and the joint heals by **[[Bony Ankylosis]]** (fusion of bone) or fibrous ankylosis.

### Tom Smith Arthritis (Septic Arthritis of Infancy)

[[Tom Smith Arthritis]] is a specific, severe form of septic arthritis affecting the **[[Hip Joint]]** in infants (usually under 1 year of age).

#### Why is the Infant Hip Vulnerable? (Anatomical Basis)
In older children and adults, the [[growth plate]] (physis) acts as a barrier, preventing the spread of infection from the metaphysis (bone) to the epiphysis (joint). However, in infants:
*   **Transphyseal Vessels:** Blood vessels cross the physis, supplying the epiphysis.
*   **Intracapsular Metaphysis:** The metaphysis of the proximal femur lies *inside* the hip joint capsule.
*   **Consequence:** An infection starting in the metaphysis (osteomyelitis) spreads directly into the hip joint, causing rapid septic arthritis.

#### Pathology of Tom Smith Arthritis
*   **Rapid Destruction:** The capital femoral epiphysis is entirely cartilaginous in infants. The proteolytic enzymes in the pus cause complete **chondrolysis** (dissolution of cartilage).
*   **Pathological Dislocation:** The head of the femur dissolves/disappears, and the hip joint becomes unstable and dislocates.
*   **Permanence:** The damage is often total and irreversible, leading to a permanent disability.

#### Clinical Features of Tom Smith Arthritis
*   **Systemic:** Septicemia, irritability, refusal to feed, high fever.
*   **Local:**
    *   **Pseudoparalysis:** The infant keeps the limb still due to pain.
    *   **Swelling:** Fullness in the gluteal region or femoral triangle.
    *   **Pain:** Crying on movement, especially during diaper changes.
    *   **[[Telescopy Test]] Positive:** Due to the destruction of the femoral head and instability, the limb can be pushed up and pulled down excessively (telescoping) in established cases.

#### Sequelae (Late Presentation)
If the acute phase is missed or inadequately treated, the child presents later (walking age) with:
*   **True Shortening** of the limb.
*   **Unstable Hip:** The femoral head is absent; the trochanter moves up.
*   **Limping:** Trendelenburg gait or waddling gait.
*   **X-ray Findings:** Absence of the [[femoral head]], dislocation of the hip, and a shallow [[acetabulum]].

### General Clinical Features of Septic Arthritis

**Symptoms:**
*   **Pain:** Severe, throbbing, present at rest and aggravated by *any* movement.
*   **Swelling:** Rapid joint distension.
*   **Fever:** High grade with chills and rigors (may be absent in neonates/immunocompromised).
*   **Pseudoparalysis:** In children, the limb is held motionless.

**Signs:**
*   **Position of Ease:** The joint is held in the position of maximum capacity to accommodate fluid and reduce pressure.
    *   **Hip:** Flexion, Abduction, External Rotation.
    *   **Knee:** Flexion (15–20 degrees).
    *   **Shoulder:** Adduction and Internal Rotation.
*   **Local Signs:** Increased temperature (calor), redness (rubor), tenderness (dolor).
*   **Muscle Spasm:** Severe spasm restricts all movements.

### Investigations

#### 1. Laboratory
*   **CBC:** [[Leukocytosis]] with a left shift (neutrophilia).
*   **Inflammatory Markers:** Raised [[ESR]] and [[C-Reactive Protein]] (CRP is more sensitive for monitoring treatment response).
*   **Blood Culture:** Positive in ~50–60% of cases.

#### 2. Joint Aspiration (The Gold Standard)
Fluid analysis differentiates septic arthritis from other causes.

| Feature | Normal | Septic Arthritis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Appearance** | Clear/Straw | Turbid/Purulent/Opaque |
| **WBC Count** | < 200/mm³ | **> 50,000/mm³** |
| **Polymorphs** | < 25% | **> 75% - 90%** |
| **Glucose** | Equal to blood | **Markedly Low** (< 25 mg/dL) |
| **Gram Stain** | Negative | Positive (often) |

#### 3. Imaging
*   **X-ray:**
    *   *Early:* Normal or widened joint space (due to effusion/capsular distension).
    *   *Late:* Narrowing of joint space (cartilage destruction), erosions, bony ankylosis.
*   **Ultrasound:** Highly sensitive for detecting joint effusion, especially in deep joints like the hip (useful for guided aspiration).
*   **MRI:** Detects early marrow edema and osteomyelitis; useful for distinguishing bone vs. joint infection.

### Differential Diagnosis
1.  **[[Transient Synovitis]] of the Hip (Irritable Hip):** Common in children, follows viral infection, low-grade fever, Kocher criteria helps distinguish.
2.  **[[Acute Osteomyelitis]]:** Tenderness is maximal over the bone (metaphysis) rather than the joint line; range of motion is relatively preserved compared to septic arthritis.
3.  **[[Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis]] (JIA):** Usually insidious, multiple joints, not acutely septic.
4.  **[[Hemarthrosis]]:** History of trauma or bleeding disorder (Hemophilia).

### Management

**Principle:** "Evacuate the pus, immobilize the joint, and eradicate the bacteria."

#### 1. General Management
*   **IV Fluids/Analgesics:** Correct dehydration and manage pain.
*   **Splintage:** Immobilize the joint in a functional position to relieve pain and prevent deformity.

#### 2. Antibiotic Therapy
*   Start **Empirical IV Antibiotics** immediately *after* collecting samples (blood/synovial fluid).
*   Usually a combination (e.g., 3rd gen [[Cephalosporin]] + Anti-staphylococcal agent like [[Vancomycin]] or [[Flucloxacillin]]).
*   Modify based on culture sensitivity.
*   Duration: Typically 4–6 weeks (IV followed by oral).

#### 3. Surgical Drainage (Arthrotomy)
*   **Indication:** **Mandatory** for the **Hip** (Tom Smith Arthritis) and often for the shoulder/knee if frank pus is present or if there is no response to aspiration.
*   **Procedure:** Open the joint, wash out pus/debris, and insert a drain.
*   **Arthroscopy:** Arthroscopic washout is an effective alternative for knees and shoulders.
*   **Repeated Aspiration:** May be sufficient for superficial joints (knee) in early stages, but surgical drainage is safer.

### Complications
*   **Bony Ankylosis:** Fusion of the joint (common end result of untreated septic arthritis).
*   **Pathological Dislocation:** Especially in the hip (Tom Smith).
*   **Growth Disturbance:** Damage to the physis causing shortening or deformity.
*   **Osteomyelitis:** Secondary spread to adjacent bone.
*   **Chronic Septic Arthritis:** If inadequately treated.
