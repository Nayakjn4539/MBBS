# [[Legal Sections]] > Important IPC Sections for Medical Professionals

### **Important IPC Sections for Medical Professionals**

The **Indian Penal Code (IPC)** (now transitioning to [[Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita]] or BNS, though IPC remains the exam standard for current curriculum) lists criminal codes that define offenses and prescribe punishments. A medical professional must be thoroughly versed in these to avoid legal pitfalls during practice.

### **1. Sections Related to Medical Negligence and Rashness**

These sections are invoked when a doctor acts rashly or negligently, endangering life or safety.

| **Section** | **Description** | **Punishment** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[IPC 304A]]** | **Causing death by negligence:** Causing death of any person by doing any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide. This is the specific section applied against doctors in fatal medical negligence cases. | Imprisonment up to **2 years**, or fine, or both. |
| **IPC 336** | Act endangering life or personal safety of others (No injury caused yet). | Imprisonment up to 3 months or fine (₹250). |
| **IPC 337** | Causing **Hurt** by act endangering life or personal safety of others. | Imprisonment up to 6 months or fine (₹500). |
| **IPC 338** | Causing **[[Grievous Hurt]]** by act endangering life or personal safety of others. | Imprisonment up to 2 years or fine (₹1000). |

**Medicolegal Aspect:**
*   **Civil vs Criminal Negligence:** For criminal liability under [[IPC 304A]], the negligence must be **gross** (reckless disregard for life). Simple lack of care usually falls under civil law (compensation) via Consumer Protection Act or Torts.

### **2. Sections Related to Consent (General Exceptions)**

These sections protect doctors from criminal liability when acts are done in good faith for the patient's benefit.

**Mnemonic: "Consent protects from 87 to 92"**

*   **[[IPC 87]] (Volenti non fit injuria):** Act not intended and not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, done by consent. Applicable to sports (boxing, fencing) and mild medical procedures. Age of consent here is **above 18 years**.
*   **[[IPC 88]] (Surgeon's Section):** Act not intended to cause death, done by consent in good faith for person's benefit. This protects surgeons performing risky operations where the patient has consented.
*   **[[IPC 89]] (Consent for Child/Insane):** Act done in good faith for benefit of a child (under 12 years) or insane person, by or by consent of the guardian (Loco parentis).
*   **[[IPC 90]] (Invalid Consent):** Consent is **NOT valid** if given under:
    *   Fear of injury.
    *   Misconception of fact.
    *   Insanity/Unsound mind.
    *   Intoxication.
    *   By a child under 12 years of age.
*   **[[IPC 91]]:** Exclusion of acts which are offenses independently of harm caused (e.g., causing [[Criminal Abortion]] is a crime even if the mother consents).
*   **[[IPC 92]] (Emergency Doctrine):** Act done in good faith for benefit of a person **without consent**, when it is impossible to signify consent (e.g., unconscious patient, emergency surgery). This is the **Good Samaritan** principle.
*   **[[IPC 93]]:** Communication made in good faith. A doctor is protected if they convey a grim prognosis to a patient in good faith, even if the shock causes harm/death.

### **3. Sections Related to Evidence and Public Justice**

Doctors often act as expert witnesses or provide documentation. Violations here are serious offenses.

(e.g., a doctor throwing away gastric lavage contents in a suspected poisoning case instead of preserving them). Punishment varies based on the gravity of the primary offense.
*   **[[IPC 202]]:** Intentional omission to give information of an offense by a person bound to inform (e.g., concealing a homicidal crime). Punishment: Imprisonment up to 6 months.
