# [[HEALTH INFORMATION & BASIC MEDICAL STATISTICS]] > Registration of vital events

### Registration of Vital Events

**Definition**
The United Nations defines a [[Vital Events Registration System]] as the "legal registration, statistical recording and reporting of the occurrence of, and the collection, compilation, presentation, analysis and distribution of statistics pertaining to vital events".

**Vital Events include:**
*   Live births
*   Deaths
*   Fetal deaths (Stillbirths)
*   Marriages
*   Divorces
*   Adoptions
*   Legitimations and recognitions.

### The Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969
In India, the registration of vital events was irregular until the central legislation was passed.
*   **Enacted:** 1969.
*   **Came into force:** 1st April 1970.
*   **Objective:** To promote uniformity and comparability of registration data across the country.
*   **Mandate:** It makes the registration of births and deaths **compulsory**.

#### Organizational Structure
The Act establishes a hierarchy for implementation:
1.  **Centre:** [[Registrar General of India]] (New Delhi) coordinates at the national level.
2.  **State:** **Chief Registrar** (usually Director of Health Services or Director of Economics & Statistics).
3.  **District:** **District Registrar** (District Health Officer/District Collector).
4.  **Local:** **Registrar** (Village Panchayat Secretary, Executive Officer of Municipality, or PHC Medical Officer).

#### Time Limits and Late Registration
A key exam topic is the timeline for registration under this Act:

| Time Period | Requirement for Registration |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Within 21 Days** | **Standard Period.** Free of charge. (For both Births and Deaths) |
| **> 21 Days to 30 Days** | Registered on payment of a **Late Fee**. |
| **> 30 Days to 1 Year** | Requires written permission from the prescribed authority (District Registrar) + Submission of an **Affidavit** + Late Fee. |
| **> 1 Year** | Registered only on an order made by a **Magistrate** (First Class/Presidency) + Late Fee. |

> **Mnemonic for Registration Time:** **"21 is the Key"** — Just like 21 is a common legal age, **21 days** is the legal limit for free registration of both births and deaths.

### Systems of Collection in India
Due to deficiencies in the [[Civil Registration System]] (CRS), India utilizes other methods to gather vital statistics.

#### 1. Civil Registration System (CRS)
*   Based on the 1969 Act.
*   **Status:** It is the ideal method but suffers from under-reporting due to illiteracy and lack of motivation in the general public.
*   **Use:** Provides legal documents (Birth/Death Certificates).

#### 2. Sample Registration System (SRS)
Since the CRS data is often incomplete, the SRS was initiated (Pilot 1964; Full scale 1969-70) to provide reliable estimates of [[Birth Rate]], [[Death Rate]], and [[Infant Mortality Rate]] (IMR) at the state and national levels.

*   **Methodology:** **Dual Record System**.
    1.  **Continuous Enumeration:** By a part-time local enumerator (e.g., a teacher).
    2.  **Retrospective Survey:** Every 6 months by a full-time supervisor.
    *   The data from both sources are matched. Unmatched events are re-verified in the field to get an accurate count.
*   **Importance:** SRS is currently the primary source of reliable fertility and mortality data in India.

#### 3. Survey of Causes of Death (Rural)
*   Formerly known as the Model Registration Scheme.
*   **Purpose:** To determine the cause of death in rural areas where doctors are unavailable to certify deaths.
*   **Method:** **Lay Reporting**. Paramedical staff use a specific non-medical list of symptoms/conditions to assign a probable cause of death (verbal autopsy),.

### Medical Certification of Cause of Death
For statistical accuracy, deaths should be medically certified.
*   **Format:** The [[International Form of Medical Certificate of Cause of Death]] is used.
*   **Structure:**
    *   **Part I:** Chain of events leading directly to death.
    *   **Part II:** Other significant conditions contributing to death but not related to the disease causing it.
*   **Concept of Underlying Cause:** The most important line for statistics is the **Underlying Cause of Death** (usually Line Ic), defined as the disease or injury that initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death.

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Duty of the Doctor:** It is the professional and legal obligation of the attending physician to issue a death certificate stating the cause of death without charging a fee.
*   **Public Health Impact:** Accurate registration allows for the calculation of health indices (IMR, MMR), which determine the allocation of health resources and the success of National Health Programmes.

### Uses of Health Information/Vital Statistics
1.  **Measuring Health Status:** Quantify health problems and needs.
2.  **Comparison:** Local, national, and international comparison of health status.
3.  **Planning & Management:** Effective management of health services and programs.
4.  **Evaluation:** Assessing whether health objectives are met.
5.  **Research:** Into etiology and pathogenesis of diseases.
