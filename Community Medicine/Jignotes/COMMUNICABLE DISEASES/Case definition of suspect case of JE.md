# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Case definition of suspect case of JE

### Case Definition of Suspect Case of Japanese Encephalitis (JE)

Under the [[National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP)]] and surveillance guidelines, Japanese Encephalitis (JE) cases are often reported under the umbrella term **[[Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES)]]** due to overlapping clinical features.

**Standard Case Definition (Suspect Case)**
A suspect case is defined as a person of **any age**, at **any time of the year** with:

1.  **[[Acute Onset of Fever]]**: Not more than 5–7 days duration.
2.  **[[Change in Mental Status]]**: This includes symptoms such as:
    *   Confusion
    *   Disorientation
    *   Coma
    *   Inability to talk.
3.  **AND/OR [[New Onset of Seizures]]**: Excluding simple febrile seizures,.

**Other Early Clinical Findings:**
*   Increase in irritability
*   Somnolence (excessive sleepiness)
*   Abnormal behavior greater than that seen with usual febrile illness,.

***

**Important Exclusion Criteria**
> **Note:** The presence of a **rash** on the body generally **excludes** Japanese Encephalitis. (AES with rash is likely Measles or Rubella).

***

### Classification of JE/AES Cases

For surveillance and management purposes, cases are further classified as follows:

| Case Type | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Suspect Case** | Matches the clinical criteria mentioned above (Fever + Mental Change/Seizure),. |
| **[[Probable Case]]** | A suspect case that occurs in close **geographical and temporal relationship** to a laboratory-confirmed case of JE in the context of an outbreak,. |
| **[[Laboratory Confirmed Case]]** | A suspected case with any one of the following markers:<br>• Presence of **IgM antibody** in serum and/or CSF to specific virus (IgM-capture ELISA).<br>• Four-fold difference in IgG antibody titre in paired sera.<br>• Virus isolation from brain tissue.<br>• Antigen detection by immunofluorescence.<br>• Nucleic acid detection by PCR,,. |

***

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Surveillance:** Since clinical features of JE are similar to other encephalopathies, the term [[Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES)]] is used for surveillance.
*   **Differential Diagnosis:**
    *   If a patient presents with AES + **Symmetrical signs**, it is likely [[Cerebral Malaria]].
    *   If a patient presents with AES + **Focal seizures** or paralysis, it is likely [[Encephalitis]].

### Mnemonic
To remember the Suspect Case definition: **"JE is M.A.D."**

*   **M** - **M**ental Status Change (Confusion/Coma)
*   **A** - **A**cute Fever (< 7 days)
*   **D** - **D**on't forget Seizures (New onset)
