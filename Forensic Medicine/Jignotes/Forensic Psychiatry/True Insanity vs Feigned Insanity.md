# [[Forensic Psychiatry]] > True Insanity vs Feigned Insanity

### **True Insanity vs. Feigned Insanity**

In [[Forensic Psychiatry]], distinguishing between a genuine mental disorder and a simulated one is a critical task for the medical officer. [[Feigned Insanity]], often referred to as **Malingering**, is the conscious, planned feigning or pretending of a disease for the sake of gain (e.g., to evade criminal responsibility or imprisonment).

The diagnosis is primarily based on clinical observation, history, and physical examination.

### **Comparison: True Insanity vs. Feigned Insanity**

The following table differentiates between a person suffering from [[True Insanity]] and a [[Malingerer]]:

| **Feature/Trait** | **True Insanity (Mental Illness)** | **Feigned Insanity (Malingering)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Onset** | Usually **gradual** (except in acute cases like delirium). | **Sudden**; typically occurs immediately after the commission of a crime. |
| **2. Motive** | Usually **absent**. No history of trying to avoid duty or punishment. | Always **present**. Usually to avoid punishment, evade duty, or gain compensation. |
| **3. Predisposing Factors** | Often **present** (e.g., family history, previous attacks, head injury, financial loss). | Usually **absent**. |
| **4. Signs & Symptoms** | **Uniform** and consistent with a known clinical entity. Present whether observed or not. | **Variable**, irregular, and exaggerated. Do not conform to any specific disease. Present only when the person knows they are being watched. |
| **5. Facial Expression** | **Peculiar**; may have a fixed, vacant, or staring look. Unaware of surroundings. | **Normal** when not observed. Frequently changing, voluntary, and watchful. Shifty eyes. |
| **6. Insomnia** | **Present**. Can go without sleep for days/nights without apparent fatigue. | Cannot persist. The person will **sleep soundly** after 1-2 days of trying to stay awake. |
| **7. Physical Exertion** | Can withstand fatigue, hunger, and cold for several days without breaking down. | Cannot stand exertion/hunger for more than a few days; breaks down easily. |
| **8. Habits/Hygiene** | Often **dirty and filthy**. Indifferent to personal cleanliness. | Usually **clean**. Habits are generally normal regarding toilet and dress. |
| **9. Reaction to Examination** | **Indifferent**. Does not mind being examined. | **Resents** frequent examination for fear of detection. May become hostile. |
| **10. Skin and Lips** | Often dry, harsh, and wrinkled. | Usually normal/moist. |
| **11. Tongue** | Often furred/coated. | Usually clean. |
| **12. Conduct** | Consistent regardless of the audience. | Plays the "part" only when an audience is present. |
| **13. Pulse/Temp** | May be increased/abnormal. | Usually normal. |

### **Mnemonic for Differentiation**

**"FEIGNED"**

*   **F** - **F**acial expression (Shifty vs Vacant)
*   **E** - **E**xertion (Cannot withstand fatigue vs Can withstand)
*   **I** - **I**nsomnia (Sleeps eventually vs True sleeplessness)
*   **G** - **G**radual onset (True) vs Sudden (Feigned)
*   **N** - **N**o Motive (True) vs Motive Present (Feigned)
*   **E** - **E**xamination (Resents it vs Indifferent)
*   **D** - **D**irty habits (True) vs Clean (Feigned)

### **Diagnosis of Feigned Insanity (Malingering)**

Detection requires careful and prolonged observation. True simulation of mental illness is extremely difficult to maintain over a long period.

1.  **History:** Obtain a detailed history from the person, relatives, and friends. Look for inconsistencies in the description of symptoms.
2.  **Observation:** Keep the patient admitted under observation. Watch them **without their knowledge** (e.g., through CCTV or a peephole).
    *   A malingerer will relax their "act" when they think they are alone.
    *   They cannot maintain the pretense of insomnia or exhaustion indefinitely.
3.  **Physical Examination:** A complete physical exam helps exclude organic causes.
    *   In true insanity, physical signs like coated tongue, dry skin, and constipation are common. These are absent in malingerers.
4.  **Psychometric Tests:** Tests like the [[Rorschach test]] or Multiphasic Personality Inventory can help detect malingering as the patterns provided by malingerers often do not match known profiles.

### **Medicolegal Aspects**

*   **Criminal Responsibility:**
    *   **True Insanity:** A person proven to be legally insane at the time of the crime is **not criminally responsible** under **Section 84 of the [[Indian Penal Code]] (IPC)**. This is based on the **[[McNaughten's Rule]]** (Right or Wrong Test), which states that the person must suffer from a defect of reason/disease of mind preventing them from knowing the nature of the act or that it was wrong.
    *   **Feigned Insanity:** If a person is found to be feigning insanity, they are fully liable for their criminal acts. Malingering itself acts as evidence of a "guilty mind" (**Mens Rea**).

*   **Civil Responsibility:**
    *   An insane person cannot make a valid contract, marriage, or **Will** ([[Testamentary Capacity]]) unless done during a **[[Lucid Interval]]**.
    *   A malingerer retains all civil responsibilities and liabilities.
