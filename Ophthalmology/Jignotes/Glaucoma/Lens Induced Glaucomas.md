# Lens Induced Glaucomas (Phacogenic Glaucomas)

Lens induced glaucomas are a group of [[secondary glaucomas]] where the intraocular pressure (IOP) rises secondary to disorders of the [[crystalline lens]]. These are classified based on the mechanism of IOP elevation into Secondary Angle Closure and Secondary Open Angle types.

### Classification

| Type of Glaucoma | Mechanism | Anterior Chamber Angle |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phacomorphic** | Swollen lens causing pupillary block | Closed |
| **Phacolytic** | Macrophages clogging trabecular meshwork | Open |
| **Phacoantigenic** | Immunological/Granulomatous reaction | Open (usually) |
| **Phacotopic** | Lens dislocation/subluxation | Closed/Open |
| **Lens Particle** | Lens cortical matter blocking outflow | Open |

### 1. Phacomorphic Glaucoma
This is a form of **secondary acute angle-closure glaucoma** caused by an intumescent (swollen) cataract. It is the most common type of lens-induced glaucoma.

#### Etiopathogenesis
*   **Cause:** Rapid maturation of senile cataract (Intumescent cataract) or traumatic rupture of the capsule allowing hydration of lens fibers.
*   **Mechanism:**
    1.  The lens becomes swollen and intumescent due to hydration.
    2.  This swollen lens pushes the [[iris]] forward and obliterates the drainage angle.
    3.  Increased irido-lenticular contact leads to **pupillary block**.
    4.  Aqueous accumulates in the posterior chamber, leading to **Iris Bombé** and secondary angle closure.

#### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:** Acute onset of severe pain, redness, watering, and marked loss of vision (similar to acute primary angle closure).
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Cornea:** Edematous and insensitive.
    *   **Anterior Chamber (AC):** Very shallow.
    *   **Pupil:** Semi-dilated and fixed.
    *   **Lens:** **Intumescent cataract** (pearly white, swollen, bulging forward).
    *   **IOP:** Markedly elevated.
    *   **Fellow Eye:** Usually has a normal/deep anterior chamber and open angle (unlike Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma where the fellow eye has a shallow AC).

#### Management
This is an ocular emergency.
1.  **Medical Therapy:** Immediate lowering of IOP using:
    *   **IV Mannitol** (Hyperosmotic agent).
    *   Systemic [[Acetazolamide]].
    *   Topical Beta-blockers (e.g., Timolol).
2.  **Laser:** [[Laser iridotomy]] may be effective in breaking the angle-closure attack.
3.  **Surgical (Definitive):** **Cataract extraction** with [[Posterior Chamber Intraocular Lens]] (PCIOL) implantation once the eye becomes quiet.

> **Clinical Implication:** Always examine the fellow eye. If the fellow eye has a deep anterior chamber, the diagnosis is likely Phacomorphic glaucoma rather than Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma (PACG).

### 2. Phacolytic Glaucoma (Lens Protein Glaucoma)
This is a **secondary open-angle glaucoma** caused by the leakage of lens proteins from a hypermature cataract.

#### Etiopathogenesis
*   **Cause:** **Hypermature Morgagnian Cataract**.
*   **Mechanism:**
    1.  Liquefaction of lens cortex occurs in hypermature cataracts.
    2.  High molecular weight lens proteins leak through a microscopically **intact** lens capsule into the [[anterior chamber]].
    3.  These proteins incite a macrophage response.
    4.  **Macrophages** engulf the lens proteins and become swollen.
    5.  These swollen macrophages, along with heavy molecular weight proteins, clog the [[trabecular meshwork]], obstructing aqueous outflow.

#### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:** Sudden onset of pain and redness (acute congestive symptoms) in an eye with longstanding poor vision.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Anterior Chamber:** Normal depth or deep (unlike phacomorphic).
    *   **Aqueous:** Turbid with milky white protein particles.
    *   **Pseudohypopyon:** Accumulation of lens protein/macrophages in the inferior AC.
    *   **Lens:** Hypermature Morgagnian cataract (milky white fluid cortex with sunken brownish nucleus).
    *   **Gonioscopy:** **Open angle**.

#### Management
1.  **Medical:** Lower IOP using anti-glaucoma medications (Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, beta-blockers, hyperosmotics).
2.  **Surgical:** Extraction of the hypermature cataract with thorough irrigation-aspiration of the anterior chamber to remove proteins and macrophages, followed by IOL implantation.

### 3. Phacoantigenic Glaucoma (Phacoanaphylactic Uveitis)
This is a form of **secondary open-angle glaucoma** caused by an immunologic response to lens proteins. It was formerly known as *Phacoanaphylactic glaucoma*, but *Phacoantigenic* is the preferred term as it is not a true anaphylaxis (Type I) but rather an immune complex/granulomatous reaction.

#### Etiopathogenesis
*   **Cause:** Occurs after the lens capsule is disrupted (ruptured) due to:
    *   Extracapsular Cataract Extraction (ECCE) with retained cortex.
    *   Penetrating trauma.
    *   Leak from hypermature cataract (rare).
*   **Mechanism:**
    1.  **Sensitization:** There is a latent period during which the eye becomes sensitized to lens proteins acting as antigens.
    2.  **Reaction:** Antigen-antibody reaction leads to severe **granulomatous uveitis**.
    3.  **Glaucoma:** The trabecular meshwork is clogged by inflammatory cells and lens particles.

#### Clinical Features
*   **History:** Prior cataract surgery or trauma (can be days to weeks later).
*   **Signs:**
    *   Severe pain and congestion.
    *   **Granulomatous Anterior Uveitis:** [[Mutton fat keratic precipitates]] (KPs) on the corneal endothelium.
    *   Presence of lens matter in the anterior chamber.
    *   Synechiae formation.

#### Management
1.  **Medical:** Control IOP and treat uveitis aggressively with **topical steroids** and cycloplegics.
2.  **Surgical:** Removal of the causative lens matter via irrigation-aspiration.
