# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Dengue fever

### **Dengue Fever**

**Dengue fever** is an acute, mosquito-borne viral disease caused by Group B Arboviruses [[Flavivirus]],. It is currently regarded as the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease in the world.

---

### **1. Epidemiological Determinants**

#### **A. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** Dengue virus (DENV). It is an RNA virus.
*   **Serotypes:** There are **4 serotypes** (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, DEN-4).
    *   Infection with one serotype gives **lifelong immunity** to *that* specific serotype.
    *   However, cross-protection against other serotypes lasts only a few months.
    *   **Important:** Sequential infection with a *different* serotype (e.g., DEN-1 followed by DEN-2) increases the risk of **Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF)** and **Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS)** due to antibody-dependent enhancement,.

#### **B. Vector Factors**
*   **Principal Vector:** *[[Aedes aegypti]]*.
    *   **Habits:** It is a **day-biter**, highly domesticated, and a **"nervous feeder"** (bites multiple people to complete one blood meal, causing cluster cases).
    *   **Appearance:** Tiger mosquito (white stripes on black body).
    *   **Breeding:** Artificial collections of water (desert coolers, flower pots, discarded tins, tyres).
*   **Secondary Vector:** *Aedes albopictus* (Aggressive feeder, found in peri-urban/rural areas).

#### **C. Host Factors**
*   Affects all ages and both sexes.
*   **High Risk for Severe Dengue:** Infants, elderly, obesity, pregnancy, and those with co-morbidities like diabetes or hypertension.

### **2. Mode of Transmission**

> Transmission cycle showing Human -> Mosquito -> Human

*   **Cycle:** Man – Mosquito – Man.
*   **Infective Period for Mosquito:** The mosquito becomes infective **8–10 days** after biting an infected person (Extrinsic Incubation Period) and remains infective for life,.
*   **Infective Period for Man:** Patients are infective to mosquitoes from the day before symptom onset to the **5th day** of illness (Viremia stage).
*   **Incubation Period (Intrinsic):** **5–6 days** (Range 3–10 days).

### **3. Clinical Spectrum**

#### **A. Classical Dengue Fever (Break-bone Fever)**
*   **Onset:** Sudden onset of high-grade fever.
*   **Pain:** Intense headache, **retro-orbital pain** (pain behind eyes), severe **myalgia** and **arthralgia** (hence the name "Break-bone fever"),.
*   **Rash:** Measles-like rash appearing on 3rd or 4th day.
*   **Fever Pattern:** Saddle-back (biphasic) fever.

#### **B. Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF)**
Defined by **four** criteria,:
1.  **Fever:** Acute onset, lasting 2–7 days.
2.  **Hemorrhagic manifestations:** Positive [[Tourniquet Test]], petechiae, ecchymosis, bleeding gums, or malena.
3.  **Thrombocytopenia:** Platelet count **<100,000 cells/mm³**.
4.  **Plasma Leakage:** Rise in Hematocrit (**>20%** above baseline), pleural effusion, or ascites.

**Mnemonic for DHF Criteria: "P-H-A-T"**
*   **P**lasma Leakage (Hematocrit rise >20%)
*   **H**emorrhagic tendencies (+ Tourniquet test)
*   **A**cute Fever (2-7 days)
*   **T**hrombocytopenia (<1 lakh)

#### **C. Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS)**
*   All criteria of DHF **PLUS** signs of circulatory failure.
*   **Critical Sign:** Narrow pulse pressure (**< 20 mmHg**) or hypotension (Systolic BP <80 mmHg in children <5 yrs),.
*   Cold clammy skin and restlessness.

### **4. Laboratory Diagnosis**

| Test | Timing | Clinical Utility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[NS1 Antigen]]** | Day 1 to Day 5 | Early diagnosis during viremia. |
| **IgM Capture ELISA** | After Day 5 | Detects recent infection (Mac-ELISA),. |
| **RT-PCR** | Early stage | Detects viral genome; highly specific. |
| **Tourniquet Test** | Clinical exam | Positive if **>20 petechiae** per square inch,. |

### **5. Management**

*   **Dengue Fever:** Symptomatic.
    *   **Bed rest** and plenty of oral fluids (ORS, fruit juices).
    *   **Antipyretics:** Paracetamol is safe.
    *   **_Clinical Relevance:_** **Do NOT give Aspirin or NSAIDs** (Ibuprofen) as they aggravate bleeding and gastritis,.
*   **DHF/DSS:**
    *   Immediate hospitalization.
    *   **Fluid Replacement:** Critical. Use Crystalloids (Ringer’s Lactate) or Colloids (Dextran 40) if shock persists.
    *   Monitor **Hematocrit** (PCV) and Platelets regularly.

### **6. Vector Indices (Surveillance)**

To assess the risk of transmission, these indices are used for *Aedes aegypti*,:

1.  **House Index:** Percentage of houses showing breeding of larvae.
2.  **Container Index:** Percentage of containers showing breeding.
3.  **Breteau Index:** Number of positive containers per 100 houses.
    *   *Note:* For yellow fever freedom, the *Aedes aegypti* index (Breteau index) should be **<1%** in towns/ports,.

---

### **7. Prevention and Control**

#### **A. Anti-Larval Measures**
*   **Source Reduction:** Eliminate breeding sites (empty coolers, cover tanks, discard tyres/coconut shells),.
*   **Chemical:** **Temephos** (Abate) granules 1 ppm is safe for potable water,.
*   **Biological:** Use of Larvivorous fish like *[[Gambusia]]* and *Poecilia*,.

#### **B. Anti-Adult Measures**
*   **Space Sprays:** Pyrethrum extract or Malathion fogging (ULV) during outbreaks to kill flying mosquitoes,.

#### **C. Personal Protection**
*   Use of mosquito nets (150 holes/sq inch).
*   Full-sleeved clothing and repellents (DEET).

#### **D. Vaccine**
*   **CYD-TDV (Dengvaxia):** Live attenuated tetravalent vaccine.
*   **Indication:** Ages 9–45 years in endemic areas.
*   **Contraindication:** Individuals who are **seronegative** (no prior dengue infection) because it acts like a primary infection and sensitizes them to severe dengue upon natural infection.
