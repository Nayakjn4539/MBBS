# [[INTERNATIONAL HEALTH]] > International organisations have many roles to play in control of pandemic

# Role of International Organizations in Pandemic Control

"Nothing on earth is more international than disease." Disease in any part of the world is a constant threat to other parts. Therefore, international organizations, particularly the [[World Health Organization (WHO)]], play a pivotal role in the prevention, control, and management of pandemics.

### 1. Global Surveillance and Early Warning
International organizations act as the central intelligence hub for global health.
*   **Epidemiological Surveillance:** The [[WHO]] collects and disseminates epidemiological information on diseases subject to **International Health Regulations (IHR)**.
*   **Notification:** Under IHR (2005), Member States must notify WHO of any event that may constitute a [[Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)]] within 24 hours.
*   **Warning Systems:** They provide timely warnings to national governments regarding outbreaks (e.g., Influenza, SARS, COVID-19) to prevent cross-border spread.

### 2. Standardization and Technical Guidelines
To ensure a unified global response, international bodies set the "rules of the game."
*   **Case Definitions:** Defining what constitutes a suspected, probable, or confirmed case to ensure data comparability across countries.
*   **Standard Treatment Protocols:** Developing evidence-based guidelines for clinical management and infection prevention control (IPC).
*   **International Standards:** Laying down uniform procedures for reporting, registration, and certification of deaths (e.g., [[International Classification of Diseases (ICD)]]).

### 3. Implementation of International Health Regulations (IHR)
The IHR provides a legal framework to prevent, protect against, control, and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease.
*   **Notifiable Diseases:** While the 1969 regulations focused on Cholera, Plague, and Yellow Fever, the **IHR (2005)** requires notification of:
    *   Smallpox
    *   Wild Polio virus
    *   SARS
    *   Human Influenza (new subtypes)
    *   Any potential PHEIC.
*   **Travel and Trade:** Balancing disease control with minimizing interference with world traffic and trade (Quarantine measures, vaccination certificates).

### 4. Coordination of Research and Development
International organizations do not usually conduct research themselves but stimulate and coordinate it.
*   **R&D:** Accelerating the development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines (e.g., during COVID-19).
*   **Collaborating Centres:** Utilizing a worldwide network of collaborating laboratories and research institutes.
*   **Standardization:** Setting standards for biological products (vaccines, sera) and drugs (International Pharmacopoeia).

### 5. Resource Mobilization and Logistics
Pandemics disproportionately affect developing nations. International bodies bridge the resource gap.
*   **Vaccine Equity:** Ensuring fair distribution of vaccines to low-income countries (e.g., efforts by [[UNICEF]] and WHO).
*   **Supplies:** Procurement and distribution of essential medicines, PPE, and oxygen concentrators.
*   **Financial Aid:** Organizations like the [[World Bank]] provide funding for health infrastructure and emergency response.

### 6. Specific Disease Control Programs
History has shown success through international cooperation:
*   **Smallpox Eradication:** A testament to international solidarity led by WHO.
*   **Polio Eradication:** The Global Polio Eradication Initiative.
*   **Malaria and HIV/AIDS:** Coordinated global strategies to reverse trends of these pandemics.

### Clinical & Public Health Relevance
During the **COVID-19 pandemic**, the necessity of international organizations was highlighted by the need for a "Global solution to a global problem." No single country can effectively manage a pandemic in isolation due to rapid international travel. The [[WHO]] declaring a **PHEIC** triggers global funding and national emergency protocols, which is the first step in containment.
