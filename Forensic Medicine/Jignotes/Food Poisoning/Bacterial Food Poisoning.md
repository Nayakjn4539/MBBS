# [[Food Poisoning]] > Bacterial Food Poisoning

### Bacterial Food Poisoning (Botulism)

Food poisoning is generally defined as an acute gastroenteritis caused by the ingestion of food or drink contaminated with bacteria, viruses, parasites, or chemicals. It is broadly classified into two types:
1.  **Infectious Type:** Caused by the multiplication of organisms (e.g., *Salmonella*, *Vibrio*, *E. coli*) within the body. Features include fever and purulent diarrhea.
2.  **Toxin Type:** Caused by the ingestion of preformed [[exotoxin]] produced by bacteria in the food before consumption (e.g., *Staphylococcus*, *Clostridium botulinum*).

**Botulism** (Allantiasis) is a severe form of **toxic** food poisoning caused by the neurotoxin produced by [[Clostridium botulinum]]. It is an intoxication, not an infection.

#### Etiological Agent
*   **Organism:** *Clostridium botulinum*.
*   **Characteristics:** Gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming bacillus.
*   **Occurrence:** Normally present in soil; contaminates vegetables and fruits.
*   **Spores:** Highly resistant to heat; can withstand boiling at 100°C for several hours. They require autoclaving to be destroyed.
*   **Toxin:**
    *   It is a powerful **exotoxin** (neurotoxin).
    *   It is **heat-labile** (destroyed by heating at **80°C for 30 minutes** or **100°C for 10 minutes**).
    *   Known as "Miracle Poison" due to its high potency.
    *   **Fatal Dose:** **0.01 mg** or less for an adult.
    *   **Types:** There are antigenically distinguishable toxins (A, B, C, D, E, F, G). Types **A, B, and E** are most commonly associated with human poisoning. Type A is the most potent.

#### Source of Poisoning
*   **Preserved Foods:** Improperly canned or bottled foods (anaerobic conditions favor toxin production).
*   **Meat products:** Sausages (Botulus = Sausage), tinned meat.
*   **Fish:** Preserved or fermented fish.
*   **Vegetables:** Home-canned green beans, peppers, etc.
*   **Honey:** Specifically associated with [[Infant Botulism]].

#### Mechanism of Action
The toxin acts selectively on the **cholinergic fibers** of the autonomic nervous system and the neuromuscular junction.
1.  It causes **presynaptic blockade**.
2.  It inhibits the release of **[[Acetylcholine]]**.
3.  This blocks nerve impulses at the **myoneural junctions**.
4.  Result: **Flaccid paralysis** of muscles. The central nervous system (CNS) is generally not affected.

#### Clinical Features
**Incubation Period:** Usually **12 to 30 hours** (Range: 12–48 hours).
*   **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea and vomiting are rare or mild. **Constipation** is a common and persistent feature.
*   **Neurological (Classic Triad):**
    1.  Bulbar palsy.
    2.  Symmetric **descending** flaccid paralysis.
    3.  Clear sensorium (Patient remains conscious until death/coma) and lack of fever.
*   **The 4 D's of Botulism:**
    1.  **D**iplopia (Double vision).
    2.  **D**ysphagia (Difficulty swallowing).
    3.  **D**ysarthria (Difficulty speaking).
    4.  **D**ry mouth (Xerostomia).
*   **Ocular signs:** Ptosis (drooping eyelids), dilated pupils (mydriasis), blurred vision, nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia.
*   **Systemic:** Muscle weakness spreading from head/neck to limbs, loss of reflexes, respiratory insufficiency.
*   **Cause of Death:** **Respiratory failure** due to paralysis of respiratory muscles.

**Mnemonic for Symptoms: "BAD PR"**
*   **B**lurred vision/Bulbar palsy
*   **A**fbrile (usually)
*   **D**ry mouth/Diplopia
*   **P**aralysis (Descending)
*   **R**espiratory failure

#### Types of Botulism
1.  **Food-borne Botulism:** Ingestion of preformed toxin (as described above).
2.  **Wound Botulism:** Infection of a wound with *C. botulinum* spores which then germinate and produce toxin.
3.  **Infant Botulism:** Occurs in infants <1 year (often due to ingestion of **honey** containing spores). The spores germinate in the gut and release toxin. Causes **"Floppy Baby Syndrome"**.
4.  **Inhalational Botulism:** Rare; potential [[bioterrorism]] agent.
5.  **Iatrogenic:** Overdose of therapeutic botulinum toxin (Botox).

#### Diagnosis
*   **History:** Consumption of canned/preserved food.
*   **Bioassay:** Injection of patient's serum/vomit/stool extract into mice (Mouse Bioassay).
*   **Culture:** Isolation of the organism from food or stool (anaerobic culture).
*   **Electromyography (EMG):** Shows characteristic facilitation of muscle action potential with repetitive stimulation.

#### Treatment
1.  **Stabilization:** Maintain Airway, Breathing, and Circulation (ABC). **Mechanical ventilation** is the mainstay if respiratory failure occurs.
2.  **Decontamination:**
    *   **Gastric lavage** and **Activated Charcoal** to remove unabsorbed toxin.
    *   Purgatives (sorbitol) to clear the gut.
3.  **Antitoxin:**
    *   **Trivalent Botulinum Antitoxin** (Types A, B, and E).
    *   Dose: One vial IV and one vial IM (after sensitivity testing).
    *   Neutralizes circulating toxin but cannot reverse already bound toxin.
4.  **Pharmacotherapy:**
    *   **[[Guanidine Hydrochloride]]** (15–40 mg/kg/day): May reverse neuromuscular block by enhancing acetylcholine release.
    *   **Antibiotics:** Penicillin is used only for wound botulism (not effective for the toxin itself).
5.  **Alcohol:** Frequent small doses of **brandy** may be beneficial as alcohol precipitates the toxin.

#### Autopsy Findings
Findings are generally non-specific (negative autopsy) but may include:
*   **Congestion:** Kidneys, liver, and meninges are congested.
*   **Microscopy:** Thrombosis may be seen in the vessels of the liver and kidneys.
*   **Pathological Changes:** Fatty degeneration of liver and kidneys.

#### Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Accidental:** Most cases are accidental due to consumption of home-canned or improperly preserved commercial foods.
*   **Mass Poisoning:** Can occur at social gatherings involving food.
*   **Bioterrorism:** Botulinum toxin is a potential Category A biological weapon (LD50 is extremely low).
*   **Therapeutic Use:** Used clinically (Botox) for strabismus, blepharospasm, and wrinkles.
