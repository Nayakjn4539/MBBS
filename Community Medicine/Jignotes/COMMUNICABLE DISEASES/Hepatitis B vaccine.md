# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Hepatitis B vaccine

### **Hepatitis B Vaccine**

**Type of Vaccine**
*   **Nature:** It is a **killed/inactivated** subunit vaccine.
*   **Preparation:** Currently, it is a **[[Recombinant DNA vaccine]]** (rDNA yeast-derived). A segment of the hepatitis B virus gene is inserted into a yeast cell, which produces the **[[Hepatitis B surface antigen]]** (HBsAg). This antigen is harvested and purified to make the vaccine,,.
*   **Adjuvant:** It is adsorbed on mineral salts like **aluminium hydroxide** or aluminium phosphate to increase immunogenicity,,.
*   **Appearance:** It is a cloudy liquid (white amorphous precipitate); it must be whitish/turbid. If clear, it implies the adjuvant has settled or the vaccine is damaged,.

**Dosage and Administration**

| Feature | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Dose** | **0.5 ml** for infants/children (< 10 years); **1.0 ml** for adults (> 15 years),,,. |
| **Route** | Deep **[[Intramuscular]]** (IM),,. |
| **Site (Infants)** | **[[Anterolateral aspect of mid-thigh]]**. Gluteal region is avoided due to fat deposition reducing absorption,,. |
| **Site (Adults)** | Deltoid muscle,,. |

**National Immunization Schedule (NIS) - India**

Under the **[[Universal Immunization Programme]]** (UIP), Hepatitis B is given as follows:

1.  **Birth Dose:**
    *   Given **within 24 hours of birth** (ideally as early as possible),,,.
    *   **Reason:** To prevent **perinatal transmission** (vertical transmission) from carrier mothers,.
    *   *Note:* Only monovalent Hepatitis B vaccine is used for the birth dose.

2.  **Primary Schedule:**
    *   Given at **6, 10, and 14 weeks**,,,.
    *   Usually administered as part of the **[[Pentavalent Vaccine]]** (DPT + Hep B + Hib) in the current NIS,,.

3.  **Adult Schedule:**
    *   Recommended for high-risk groups (Health care workers).
    *   Schedule: **0, 1, and 6 months**,,.

---

**Storage and Cold Chain**
*   **Temperature:** Store at **+2°C to +8°C**,.
*   **Freeze Sensitivity:** It is **highly freeze-sensitive**. Freezing breaks the bond between the antigen and the alum adjuvant, destroying potency,,.
    *   *Order of freeze sensitivity:* Hep B > DPT > DT > TT.
    *   **Do NOT** keep in the freezer compartment or in direct contact with ice packs,.
*   **Shake Test:** Used to determine if the vaccine has been frozen and damaged. If the vaccine has been frozen, it forms flakes that settle quickly (faster than control). If it fails the shake test, **discard it**,,.
*   **Open Vial Policy:** Applicable. Can be used up to **28 days** after opening if VVM is valid and cold chain is maintained,,.

**Efficacy and Immunity**
*   **Protective Level:** Anti-HBs titer **> 10 mIU/ml** is considered protective.
*   **Seroconversion:** Induces protective antibody levels in >95% of infants/children,.
*   **Duration:** Protection lasts at least 15 years, likely **lifelong**,,.

**Clinical Relevance & Post-Exposure Prophylaxis**

1.  **Perinatal Transmission (HBsAg+ Mother):**
    *   The infant must receive **Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (HBIG)** (0.5 ml) AND the **Hepatitis B Vaccine** within **24 hours** of birth (ideally within 12 hours),,.
    *   They should be given at **different anatomical sites**,.

2.  **Accidental Exposure (Needle Stick Injury):**
    *   **Unvaccinated:** Give HBIG (within 6-48 hours) + Start Vaccine series (0, 1, 6 months),.
    *   **Vaccinated (Responder):** No treatment needed.
    *   **Vaccinated (Non-responder):** HBIG + Vaccine booster OR 2 doses of HBIG.

**Contraindications & Side Effects**
*   **Contraindications:** History of anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) to a previous dose or to **yeast**,.
    *   *Note:* Pregnancy and lactation are **NOT** contraindications,,.
*   **Side Effects:** Mild fever, pain/soreness at injection site, fatigue,,.

**Mnemonic to Remember**

**"H-E-P B"**

*   **H** - **H**eat stable (relatively), but **Highly Freeze Sensitive**.
*   **E** - **E**arly birth dose (within 24 hours).
*   **P** - **P**entavalent component (given at 6, 10, 14 weeks).
*   **B** - **B**aker's Yeast (made from yeast, contraindicated in yeast allergy).
