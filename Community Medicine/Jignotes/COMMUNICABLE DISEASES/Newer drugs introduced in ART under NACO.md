# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Newer drugs introduced in ART under NACO

# Newer Drugs Introduced in ART under NACO

The [[National AIDS Control Organisation]] (NACO) has updated the **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)** guidelines to include potent, well-tolerated drugs with a high barrier to resistance. The most significant introduction is the class of **Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors (INSTIs)**, specifically **Dolutegravir**.

### 1. Dolutegravir (DTG) - The Game Changer
This is an **Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor (INSTI)** which has replaced Efavirenz (NNRTI) in the preferred first-line regimen.

*   **Mechanism:** Blocks the action of integrase, a viral enzyme that inserts the viral genome into the DNA of the host cell.
*   **Dosage:** 50 mg.
*   **Key Advantages:**
    *   High genetic barrier to drug resistance.
    *   Rapid viral suppression.
    *   Fewer side effects/better tolerability compared to Efavirenz.
    *   Harmonization of treatment across various groups (adults, adolescents, pregnant women).

### 2. The TLD Regimen (Preferred First-Line)
NACO now recommends a **Fixed Dose Combination ([[FDC]])** in a single pill taken once daily. This is the standard of care for all [[PLHIV]] (People Living with HIV) > 10 years of age and body weight > 30 kg.

**Composition of TLD:**
*   **T**enofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (**TDF**) – 300 mg (NtRTI)
*   **L**amivudine (**3TC**) – 300 mg (NRTI)
*   **D**olutegravir (**DTG**) – 50 mg (INSTI)

*Note: This regimen is taken preferably at bedtime.*

### 3. Newer Regimens for Children (Paediatric ART)
For children, the choice of drugs depends on age and weight. New FDCs have been introduced to improve adherence.

*   **ALD Regimen:** Used for children > 6 years and > 20 kg.
    *   **A**bacavir (**ABC**)
    *   **L**amivudine (**3TC**)
    *   **D**olutegravir (**DTG**)
*   **Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r):** Recommended as the preferred third drug for children < 6 years or < 20 kg until Dolutegravir becomes available for this group.

### 4. Third-Line ART Drugs
For patients failing second-line therapy, NACO rolled out third-line regimens in 2015. These are specialized drugs used under the guidance of Centres of Excellence (CoE).

*   **Integrase Inhibitor:** **[[Raltegravir]] (RAL)**.
*   **Protease Inhibitor:** **[[Darunavir]] (DRV)**.
    *   Usually boosted with Ritonavir.

### 5. Drugs for Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)
The newer drugs are also utilized for [[Post-Exposure Prophylaxis]] (e.g., after needle stick injury). The preferred regimen is **TLD**.

*   **Regimen:** Tenofovir (300 mg) + Lamivudine (300 mg) + Dolutegravir (50 mg).
*   **Duration:** Single pill daily for **28 days**.
*   **Timing:** Start within 2 hours of exposure (Maximum within 72 hours).

### Summary Table of ART Classes and Newer Drugs

| Drug Class | Older/Existing Drugs | **Newer/Preferred Drugs under NACO** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NRTI/NtRTI** (Backbone) | Zidovudine (AZT), Stavudine (d4T) | **Tenofovir (TDF)**, **Abacavir (ABC)**, **Lamivudine (3TC)** |
| **NNRTI** | Nevirapine (NVP), Efavirenz (EFV) | *Phased out from preferred first-line* |
| **INSTI** (Integrase Inhibitors) | | **[[Dolutegravir]] (DTG)** (1st Line), **Raltegravir** (3rd Line) |
| **Protease Inhibitors (PI)** | Indinavir, Saquinavir | **Atazanavir/Ritonavir** (2nd Line), **Darunavir** (3rd Line) |

**Clinical Relevance:**
*   **Viral Load Suppression:** The primary goal of introducing these newer drugs (specifically Dolutegravir) is to achieve the "Undetectable = Untransmittable" status and meet the **95-95-95 targets** (95% diagnosed, 95% on treatment, 95% virally suppressed) by 2024.
*   **Adherence:** The shift to single-pill FDCs (TLD) significantly improves patient compliance compared to multi-pill regimens.

### 💡 Mnemonic for TLD Regimen
**"T**ender **L**oving **D**ose"
*   **T**enofovir
*   **L**amivudine
*   **D**olutegravir
*(Because it is patient-friendly, single pill, and well-tolerated)*
