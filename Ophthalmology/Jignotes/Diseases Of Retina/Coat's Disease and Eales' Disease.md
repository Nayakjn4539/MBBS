# [[Diseases Of Retina]] > Coat's Disease and Eales' Disease

# Coats' Disease

### Definition and Overview
**[[Coats' Disease]]** (also known as exudative retinopathy of Coats) is a severe form of **idiopathic congenital retinal telangiectasia** characterized by irregular dilation of the capillary bed and segmental dilation of neighboring venules and arterioles.,,
*   It leads to a breakdown of the [[Blood-Retinal Barrier]] in endothelial cells, resulting in massive subretinal exudation.

### Epidemiology
*   **Age:** Typically affects children in the **first decade of life** (Peak onset 6-8 years).,
*   **Gender:** Predominantly affects **males** (Boys > Girls).,
*   **Laterality:** Invariably **Unilateral** (affects one eye).,

### Pathogenesis
1.  **Vascular Anomaly:** Congenital anomalies of retinal vessels (telangiectasia, aneurysms).
2.  **Barrier Breakdown:** Breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier in endothelial cells.
3.  **Leakage:** Leakage of blood products containing **cholesterol crystals** and **lipid-laden macrophages** into the retina and subretinal space.
4.  **Result:** Massive intra-retinal and subretinal exudation leading to [[Exudative Retinal Detachment]].

### Clinical Features
**Symptoms:**
*   **[[Leukocoria]]**: A yellowish-white pupillary reflex (Amaurotic cat's eye reflex). It is a major differential diagnosis for [[Retinoblastoma]].,
*   **[[Strabismus]]**: Squinting of the eye.,
*   **Visual Loss:** Painless loss of vision.

**Signs:**
*   **Fundus Examination:**
    *   Large, raised, yellowish-white areas of **subretinal exudation** (often massive).
    *   **Retinal Telangiectasia:** Dilated, tortuous vessels with aneurysms (fusiform/saccular), often near the posterior pole.
    *   **Cholesterol Crystals:** Glistening deposits within the exudates.
    *   **[[Exudative Retinal Detachment]]**: The shape of the RD is convex and shifting fluid is present.,

### Complications
In late stages, the condition may progress to:
*   [[Complicated Cataract]]
*   [[Uveitis]]
*   [[Secondary Glaucoma]]
*   [[Phthisis Bulbi]]

### Diagnosis
*   **[[Fundus Fluorescein Angiography]] (FFA):** Highlights abnormal vessels, leakage, and areas of capillary drop out (non-perfusion).
*   **Ultrasonography/CT:** Useful to rule out Retinoblastoma (absence of calcification in Coats').

### Treatment
1.  **Early Stage:**
    *   **[[Laser Photocoagulation]]** or **[[Cryotherapy]]**: Directed at the abnormal telangiectatic vessels to obliterate them and check disease progression.
2.  **Advanced Stage (Retinal Detachment):**
    *   Treatment becomes difficult; success rate declines significantly.
    *   Surgical intervention may be required but prognosis is guarded.

# Eales' Disease

### Definition and Overview
**[[Eales' Disease]]** (also known as **Periphlebitis Retinae**) is an idiopathic inflammatory venous occlusion (vasculitis) primarily affecting the **peripheral retinal veins**. It is characterized by recurrent [[Vitreous Hemorrhage]].,

### Epidemiology
*   **Age:** Young adults (typically **20–30 years**).,
*   **Gender:** Predominantly affects **males**.,
*   **Laterality:** Usually **Bilateral** (though may be asymmetric).
*   **Geography:** Common in India and Asian countries.

### Etiology
*   **Idiopathic:** Exact cause is unknown.
*   **Hypersensitivity:** Strongly associated with hypersensitivity to **[[Tuberculoprotein]]** (TB).,

### Clinical Stages and Pathology
The disease progression is described in four stages:

1.  **Stage of Active Inflammation (Vasculitis):**
    *   Congestion of peripheral veins.
    *   **Perivascular exudates and sheathing** (white lines along vessels).
    *   Superficial hemorrhages (flame-shaped) near affected veins.
2.  **Stage of Ischemia/Occlusion:**
    *   Obliteration of vessels leading to peripheral capillary non-perfusion (CNP).
    *   Visible on FFA as avascular zones.
3.  **Stage of [[Retinal Neovascularization]]:**
    *   Hypoxia leads to formation of fragile new vessels (**NVE**: Neovascularization Elsewhere) at the junction of perfused and non-perfused retina.
    *   These vessels bleed easily causing recurrent **[[Vitreous Hemorrhage]]**.
    *   Often described as **Sea Fan** neovascularization.
4.  **Stage of Sequelae:**
    *   [[Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy]] (PVR).
    *   [[Tractional Retinal Detachment]].
    *   [[Rubeosis Iridis]] and [[Neovascular Glaucoma]].

### Clinical Features
**Symptoms:**
*   **Sudden painless loss of vision:** Due to massive vitreous hemorrhage.,
*   **Floaters:** Sudden appearance of black spots/cobwebs (small hemorrhages).
*   **Recurrent Attacks:** History of vision clearing and then blurring again due to fresh bleeds.

### Diagnosis
*   **Clinical Exam:** Visualization of sheathed vessels, hemorrhages, or neovascularization in the periphery.
*   **[[Fundus Fluorescein Angiography]] (FFA):** Essential to document areas of capillary non-perfusion and leakage from new vessels.

### Treatment
1.  **Medical Management:**
    *   **Systemic [[Corticosteroids]]**: Mainstay for active periphlebitis/inflammation.
    *   **Antitubercular Therapy (ATT):** Recommended in selective cases with evidence of TB hypersensitivity.
2.  **Laser Therapy:**
    *   **Sectoral/Scatter [[Laser Photocoagulation]]**: Applied to ischemic areas to cause regression of neovascularization.
3.  **Surgical Management:**
    *   **[[Pars Plana Vitrectomy]]**: Indicated for non-resolving vitreous hemorrhage (usually > 3 months) or tractional retinal detachment.
