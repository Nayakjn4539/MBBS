# Ankle Sprains: [[Anterior Talofibular Ligament]] (ATFL) Injury

### Introduction and Anatomy
[[Ankle sprains]] are among the most common musculoskeletal injuries, particularly in sports. The stability of the [[ankle joint]] depends on the bony configuration (mortise) and the ligamentous complexes.

**Lateral Ligament Complex:**
The lateral side of the ankle is supported by three discrete ligaments. These are the most frequently injured structures during an inversion injury.
1.  **[[Anterior Talofibular Ligament]] (ATFL):**
    *   **Characteristics:** The weakest of the three lateral ligaments.
    *   **Incidence:** It is the **most common ligament injured** in the entire body.
    *   **Function:** Resists anterior displacement of the [[talus]] and plantarflexion.
2.  **[[Calcaneofibular Ligament]] (CFL):** The second most commonly injured. Stabilizes the subtalar joint.
3.  **[[Posterior Talofibular Ligament]] (PTFL):** The strongest of the lateral ligaments; rarely torn unless there is a complete dislocation.

### Mechanism of Injury
The classic mechanism for an ATFL injury is **Inversion** combined with **Plantarflexion**.
*   **Scenario:** A sudden twist of the ankle, often stepping on an uneven surface, landing awkwardly from a jump, or stepping on an opponent's foot.
*   **Sequence:** The force typically ruptures the [[Anterior Talofibular Ligament]] first. If the force continues, the [[Calcaneofibular Ligament]] may also rupture.

### Classification of Ligament Injuries (Sprains)
Sprains are graded based on the severity of the damage to the ligament fibers.

| Grade | Pathology | Clinical Findings | Stability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Grade I** | Stretching or microscopic tear | Minimal swelling, mild tenderness, no ecchymosis | Stable joint |
| **Grade II** | Partial macroscopic tear | Moderate swelling, tenderness, some ecchymosis | Mild to moderate instability |
| **Grade III** | Complete rupture | Severe swelling, significant ecchymosis, hemarthrosis | Gross mechanical instability |

### Clinical Features
**Symptoms:**
*   **Pain:** Immediate and severe on the lateral aspect of the ankle.
*   **Swelling:** Usually appears rapidly (diffuse or localized over the lateral malleolus).
*   **"Pop" or "Snap":** Patient may report hearing or feeling a snap at the time of injury.
*   **Difficulty Weight Bearing:** Varies from a limp to complete inability to bear weight.

**Signs:**
*   **Tenderness:** Localized over the ATFL (anterior to the tip of the [[lateral malleolus]]).
*   **Ecchymosis:** Bruising often appears below the lateral malleolus, sometimes extending to the foot (gravity-dependent).
*   **[[Haemarthrosis]]:** Presence of blood within the joint, typically seen in Grade II and III injuries.

### Clinical Examination and Special Tests
*   **Look:** Check for swelling, deformity, and bruising.
*   **Feel:** Palpate the tip of the lateral malleolus, the base of the [[fifth metatarsal]] (to rule out Jones fracture), and the course of the ligaments.
*   **Move:** Assess range of motion; usually restricted due to pain.

**Special Tests:**
1.  **[[Anterior Drawer Test]]:**
    *   *Purpose:* Tests the integrity of the **ATFL**.
    *   *Technique:* Patient seated with knee flexed to relax the [[gastrocnemius]]. The examiner stabilizes the distal tibia with one hand and pulls the heel anteriorly with the other.
    *   *Positive Sign:* Increased anterior translation of the [[talus]] compared to the uninjured side, often with a "clunk" or lack of a firm end point.

2.  **[[Talar Tilt Test]] (Inversion Stress Test):**
    *   *Purpose:* Primarily tests the **CFL**.
    *   *Technique:* The ankle is inverted forcibly.
    *   *Positive Sign:* Excessive tilting of the talus implies combined injury to ATFL and CFL.

**Clinical Implication:** Always examine the proximal fibula (Maisonneuve fracture) and the base of the 5th metatarsal (avulsion fracture) as these can mimic ankle sprains.

### Investigations
*   **X-Ray (Ankle Series):**
    *   **Views:** Anteroposterior (AP), Lateral, and Mortise views.
    *   **Purpose:** To rule out bony fractures (malleolar fractures, talar dome fractures).
    *   **Ottawa Ankle Rules:** A guideline to decide if X-rays are necessary (e.g., bone tenderness at the posterior edge of the malleolus or inability to bear weight).
*   **Stress X-rays:** May show talar tilt or anterior subluxation but are painful and often require anesthesia; largely replaced by MRI.
*   **[[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI):**
    *   **Indication:** Not routine for acute sprains. Used for chronic pain, suspected osteochondral lesions, or competitive athletes to grade the injury precisely.
    *   **Findings:** Discontinuity of ligament fibers, bone bruising, or wavy contour of the ligament.

### Treatment
The management depends on the severity but is predominantly conservative.

#### 1. Acute Phase Management
**RICE Protocol:**
*   **R**est: Avoid activities that cause pain; use crutches if necessary.
*   **I**ce: Cryotherapy to reduce swelling and pain.
*   **C**ompression: Elastic bandage to control edema.
*   **E**levation: Limb elevated above heart level to assist venous return.

*   **Medication:** [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs) for pain and inflammation.

#### 2. Functional Treatment (Preferred for Grade I & II)
*   **Protection:** Use of an ankle brace, air-stirrup, or taping to prevent inversion while allowing dorsiflexion/plantarflexion.
*   **Early Mobilization:** Weight-bearing as tolerated is encouraged to promote healing and proprioception.
*   **Rehabilitation:**
    *   **Strengthening:** Focus on [[peroneal muscles]] (evertors).
    *   **Proprioceptive Training:** Balance board exercises to restore neuromuscular control and prevent recurrence.

#### 3. Immobilization (Severe Grade III)
*   For severe sprains with gross instability or those who cannot bear weight, a short period (1-3 weeks) of immobilization in a below-knee cast or walking boot may be required before starting functional rehabilitation.

#### 4. Surgical Treatment
*   **Indications:** rare for acute injuries.
    *   High-demand athletes with Grade III rupture (controversial).
    *   Large bony avulsion fragments.
    *   **Chronic [[Ankle Instability]]:** Failure of conservative treatment with recurrent giving way.
*   **Procedure:** Anatomical repair (e.g., [[Brostrom procedure]]) or ligament reconstruction using tendon grafts.

### Complications
*   **Chronic Ankle Instability:** Recurrent sprains and feeling of "giving way" due to mechanical laxity or functional (proprioceptive) deficit.
*   **[[Osteochondral Lesions]] of the Talus:** Damage to the cartilage of the talar dome.
*   **Peroneal Tendon Injury:** Tendonitis or subluxation.
*   **Anterior Impingement Syndrome:** Soft tissue or bony spurs causing pain on dorsiflexion.
*   **Post-traumatic [[Osteoarthritis]]:** Long-term consequence of altered joint mechanics.
