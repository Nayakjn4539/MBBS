# [[Nerve Injuries]] > Radial Nerve Injury

### Radial Nerve Injury

[[Radial Nerve]] injury is the most common peripheral nerve injury associated with skeletal trauma. The [[Radial Nerve]] is the continuation of the **posterior cord** of the [[Brachial Plexus]] (Root Value: C5, C6, C7, C8, T1). It is primarily a motor nerve (extensor of the upper limb) and has the best prognosis among peripheral nerve injuries.

### Relevant Anatomy and Course

> Course of the Radial Nerve showing relation to the Humerus, Spiral Groove, and division into Superficial and Deep branches

1.  **Axilla:** Lies behind the [[Axillary Artery]].
2.  **Arm:** Winds around the **Spiral Groove** (Radial Groove) on the posterior aspect of the [[Humerus]] between the lateral and medial heads of the [[Triceps]].
3.  **Elbow:** Pierces the **lateral intermuscular septum** to enter the anterior compartment. Lies between [[Brachialis]] and [[Brachioradialis]].
4.  **Forearm:** At the level of the [[Lateral Epicondyle]], it divides into:
    *   **Superficial Branch:** Purely sensory.
    *   **Deep Branch (Posterior Interosseous Nerve - PIN):** Purely motor. Pierces the [[Supinator Muscle]] (through the **Arcade of Frohse**).

**Structures Supplied:**
*   **Motor:** [[Triceps]], [[Anconeus]], [[Brachioradialis]], [[Extensor Carpi Radialis Longus]] (ECRL), [[Supinator]], and via PIN to all extensors of the fingers and thumb.
*   **Sensory:** Posterior arm, posterior forearm, and the dorsum of the hand (lateral 3½ digits up to the middle phalanx). The **Autonomous Zone** is the **dorsum of the first web space**.

### Etiology and Mechanism of Injury

The nerve can be injured at various levels due to different mechanisms:

| Level of Injury | Common Causes/Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Axilla (Very High)** | • **Crutch Palsy**: Improper use of crutches pressing on the axilla.<br>• **Saturday Night Palsy**: Falling asleep with arm over a chair back (compressing axilla).<br>• Shoulder Dislocation (rare compared to [[Axillary Nerve]]). |
| **Arm/Spiral Groove (High)** | • **Fracture Shaft of Humerus** (Middle 1/3 or Junction of Middle and Distal 1/3).<br>• **Tourniquet Palsy**: Prolonged compression.<br>• **Holstein-Lewis Fracture**: Spiral fracture of distal 1/3 humerus leading to nerve entrapment. |
| **Elbow (Low)** | • Fracture/Dislocation of the Radial Head.<br>• Monteggia Fracture-Dislocation.<br>• Iatrogenic (during surgery for tennis elbow or radial head). |
| **Forearm/Wrist** | • **Handcuff Neuropathy** (Superficial radial nerve compression).<br>• Tight watch straps or casts. |

**Clinical Implication:** [[Holstein-Lewis Fracture]] is a fracture of the distal third of the humerus where the [[Radial Nerve]] is trapped by the lateral intermuscular septum, often requiring operative release.

### Clinical Features: Levels of Lesion

The clinical presentation depends entirely on the level of the lesion.

#### 1. Very High Lesion (Axilla)
*   **Motor Loss:**
    *   Paralysis of **Triceps** (Loss of elbow extension).
    *   Paralysis of wrist extensors ([[Wrist Drop]]).
    *   Paralysis of finger and thumb extensors (Finger/Thumb drop).
    *   Paralysis of [[Brachioradialis]] and [[Supinator]].
*   **Sensory Loss:** Extensive loss over the posterior arm, forearm, and dorsum of the hand.

#### 2. High Lesion (Spiral Groove/Mid-Humeral)
*   **Most Common Presentation.**
*   **Motor Loss:**
    *   **Triceps is SPARED:** Elbow extension is normal (nerve to triceps arises before the spiral groove).
    *   Paralysis of [[Brachioradialis]] and wrist extensors -> **[[Wrist Drop]]**.
    *   Paralysis of finger extensors.
*   **Sensory Loss:** Variable sensation loss on the dorsum of the hand (first web space). Posterior cutaneous nerve of the arm is usually spared.

#### 3. Low Lesion (Posterior Interosseous Nerve / PIN Palsy)
*   Occurs at the level of the radial neck/supinator.
*   **Motor Loss:**
    *   Paralysis of finger and thumb extensors (**Finger Drop** and **Thumb Drop**).
    *   **Wrist Extension is PRESERVED:** Because the [[Extensor Carpi Radialis Longus]] (ECRL) is supplied by the main radial nerve *before* it divides.
    *   **Radial Deviation:** When the patient attempts to extend the wrist, the hand deviates radially because the *Extensor Carpi Ulnaris* (supplied by PIN) is paralyzed, but ECRL is intact.
*   **Sensory Loss:** **NONE**. The PIN is a purely motor nerve. Pain may be present over the lateral forearm.

### Clinical Examination and Tests

**1. Motor Examination**
*   **Check Elbow Extension:** To rule out very high lesions (Triceps).
*   **Check Wrist Extension:** Ask the patient to lift the wrist against gravity. Inability indicates [[Wrist Drop]].
*   **Check Finger Extension:** Ask the patient to extend fingers at the **Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints**.
    *   *Pitfall:* Extension at the Interphalangeal (IP) joints is performed by **Lumbricals and Interossei** (Median/Ulnar nerves). A patient with radial palsy *can* extend IP joints but *cannot* extend MCP joints.
*   **Check Thumb Extension:** Ask the patient to do a "thumbs up" ([[Hitchhiker's Sign]]).

**2. Sensory Examination**
*   Check sensation in the **Autonomous Zone**: The dorsum of the first web space (between thumb and index finger).

**3. Trick Movements**
*   Patients may flex the fingers strongly; relaxation mimics extension.
*   Gravity can flex the wrist, which may be mistaken for movement if the arm is not supported properly.

### Management

The management depends on whether the injury is associated with a closed or open fracture.

#### A. Closed Fractures (e.g., Closed # Shaft Humerus)
**Standard of Care:** Conservative Management.
*   **Reason:** The nerve is usually intact (Neurapraxia) or continuity is maintained (Axonotmesis). Spontaneous recovery rate is high (>90%).
*   **Protocol:**
    1.  **Splinting:** Use a **[[Cock-up Splint]]** (static) or a **Dynamic Radial Nerve Splint**.
        *   *Static:* Holds wrist in extension to prevent contracture and overstretching of paralyzed muscles.
        *   *Dynamic:* Uses springs/rubber bands to extend fingers/wrist while allowing active flexion.
    2.  **Physiotherapy:** Passive movements to maintain joint mobility.
    3.  **Observation:** Monitor for recovery (Tinel’s sign advancement).
    4.  **Investigations:** If no recovery by 3–4 months (calculated by distance to muscle x 1mm/day), perform **NCV/EMG**.

#### B. Open Fractures
**Standard of Care:** Surgical Exploration.
*   The nerve should be explored during wound debridement/fracture fixation.
*   **Clean cut:** Primary repair (Epineural suture).
*   **Contaminated/Crush:** Tag nerve ends, delayed repair or [[Nerve Grafting]] (Sural nerve graft) later.

#### C. Holstein-Lewis Fracture
*   Management is controversial but leans towards **early exploration** because the nerve may be entrapped within the fracture site or lacerated by the spiral fracture spike.

### Tendon Transfers

If the nerve injury is irreparable or recovery fails after 1 year, **[[Tendon Transfer]]** is performed. This involves using functioning muscles (median/ulnar innervated) to restore radial nerve function.

**Principles (Modified Jones Transfer):**
The goal is to restore:
1.  Wrist Extension.
2.  Finger Extension.
3.  Thumb Extension/Abduction.

| Function Lost | Donor Tendon (Intact Muscle) | Recipient Tendon |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Wrist Extension** | [[Pronator Teres]] (PT) | [[Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis]] (ECRB) |
| **Finger Extension** | [[Flexor Carpi Ulnaris]] (FCU) OR [[Flexor Carpi Radialis]] (FCR) | [[Extensor Digitorum Communis]] (EDC) |
| **Thumb Extension** | [[Palmaris Longus]] (PL) | [[Extensor Pollicis Longus]] (EPL) |

*Mnemonic for Transfers:* **P-E** (Pronator-Extension wrist), **F-E** (Flexor-Extension fingers), **P-L** (Palmaris-Longus thumb).

### Splints

*   **Static Cock-up Splint:** Keeps wrist in 30-40 degrees extension. Prevents wrist flexion contracture.
*   **Dynamic Splint:** Allows the patient to grasp objects (active flexion) while the splint pulls the fingers back into extension (passive extension).
