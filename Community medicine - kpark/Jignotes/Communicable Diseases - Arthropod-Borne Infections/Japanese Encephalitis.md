# Japanese Encephalitis (JE)

[[Japanese Encephalitis]] is a leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia. It is a mosquito-borne **zoonotic disease** (infecting mainly animals and incidentally man). In India, it is a major public health problem, particularly in states like Uttar Pradesh (Gorakhpur), West Bengal, Assam, and Tamil Nadu.

### 1. Epidemiological Determinants

#### Agent Factors
*   **Agent:** JE Virus.
*   **Type:** Group B Arbovirus ([[Flavivirus]]).
*   **Genome:** Single-stranded RNA virus.
*   **Antigenicity:** Antigenically related to West Nile and Dengue viruses.

#### Vector (The Transporter)
*   **Genus:** *Culex* mosquitoes.
*   **Primary Vector:** *[[Culex tritaeniorhynchus]]*.
*   **Other Vectors:** *Culex vishnui*, *Culex gelidus*.
*   **Habits:**
    *   **Breeding:** Irrigated **rice fields** (paddy fields), ditches, and shallow stagnant water.
    *   **Feeding:** Zoophilic (prefers animals), exophillic (rests outdoors).
    *   **Biting time:** Dusk and Dawn (Crepuscular).
*   **Flight Range:** 1-3 km (can go further with wind).

#### Host Factors (The Cycle)
JE has a complex life cycle involving three types of hosts:

| Host Type | Animal | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Reservoir / Maintenance Host** | **Ardeid Birds** (Pond herons, Cattle egrets) | They maintain the virus in nature (Bird-Mosquito-Bird cycle). |
| **Amplifying Host** | **[[Pigs]]** | Virus multiplies rapidly causing high viremia without killing the pig. They infect mosquitoes easily. |
| **Dead End / Incidental Host** | **Man, Horse, Cattle** | **Humans** do not develop sufficient viremia to infect mosquitoes. Cattle act as "Mosquito Attractants" (divert mosquitoes from humans). |

> **Mnemonic for Hosts:**
> *   **B**irds = **B**ase (Reservoir)
> *   **P**igs = **P**opulate (Amplifier)
> *   **H**umans = **H**alt (Dead End)

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw the transmission cycle showing Ardeid birds and Pigs as the natural cycle, with mosquitoes transmitting it to Humans as a dead-end branch.

### 2. Transmission Dynamics
*   **Mode:** Bite of an infective culicine mosquito.
*   **Transmission Cycle:** Pig $\rightarrow$ Mosquito $\rightarrow$ Pig (Amplifying cycle). Spillover to humans occurs when vector density is high.
*   **Risk of Human-to-Human Transmission:** **None**. Man is a dead-end host.
*   **Seasonality:** Correlates with the rainy season and pre-harvest period (paddy cultivation).

---

### 3. Clinical Features
*   **[[Incubation Period]]:** 5 to 15 days.
*   **Iceberg Phenomenon:** Highly prevalent. Ratio of Overt disease : Inapparent infection = **1:300 to 1:1000**.

**Clinical Stages:**
1.  **Prodromal Stage (1–6 days):**
    *   Acute onset fever, headache, malaise.
    *   GI disturbances (nausea, vomiting).
2.  **Acute Encephalitic Stage:**
    *   High fever ($38^{\circ}$C to $41^{\circ}$C).
    *   **Nuchal rigidity** (Neck stiffness).
    *   **[[Convulsions]]** (Common in children).
    *   Altered sensorium, confusion, delirium, coma.
    *   Mask-like face and coarse tremors (Extrapyramidal signs).
3.  **Late Stage/Sequelae:**
    *   Temperature normalizes.
    *   Neurological deficits may persist (mental retardation, paralysis, parkinsonian features).
*   **Case Fatality Rate (CFR):** 20% to 40% (can reach 58%).

### 4. Diagnosis
It is reported under the umbrella of **[[Acute Encephalitis Syndrome]] (AES)**.
*   **Standard Test:** **[[IgM Capture ELISA]]**.
    *   Detects specific IgM in CSF or Blood.
    *   Positive within 7 days of onset.
*   **Other Tests:**
    *   RT-PCR (for viral genome).
    *   Virus Isolation (rarely successful from human blood due to transient viremia).

---

### 5. Treatment
There is **no specific antiviral drug**. Management is purely **supportive and symptomatic**.
*   **Hospitalization:** Essential.
*   **Fluid & Electrolyte balance:** Maintenance is crucial.
*   **Control of Convulsions:** Anticonvulsants (Diazepam/Phenytoin).
*   **Cerebral Edema:** Mannitol/Diuretics to reduce intracranial pressure.
*   **Airway Management:** Ensure oxygenation; prevent aspiration pneumonia.
*   **General Care:** Prevention of bedsores, nutritional support.

### 6. Prevention and Control

#### A. Vaccination (Most Effective)
Under the **Universal Immunization Programme (UIP)** in endemic districts:

| Feature | **Live Attenuated Vaccine** (Current Usage) | **Killed Vaccine** (Older/Alternatives) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strain** | **[[SA 14-14-2]]** (Cell culture derived) | Nakayama / Beijing / JENVAC (Kolar Strain) |
| **Dose** | 0.5 ml | 0.5 ml |
| **Route** | Subcutaneous (Left Upper Arm) | Intramuscular (IM) |
| **Schedule (NIS)** | **2 Doses:** <br>1. At 9 months (with Measles-1)<br>2. At 16-24 months (with DPT Booster) | Primary doses + Boosters |
| **Efficacy** | High (>90%) | Requires boosters |

#### B. Vector Control
*   **Aerial/Ground Fogging:** Ultra-Low Volume (ULV) fogging with Malathion/Pyrethrum for outbreak control.
*   **Surface Spraying:** Not very effective as vectors are exophillic (rest outdoors).
*   **Personal Protection:** Use of **Insecticide Treated Bed Nets ([[ITBN]])**, long sleeves, repellents.
*   **Larval Control:** Use of **[[Larvivorous fish]]** (Gambusia, Guppy) in paddy fields; intermittent irrigation techniques.

#### C. Control of Amplifying Hosts (Pigs)
*   **Segregation:** Keeping pigsties away from human habitations (2–5 km).
*   **Pig Vaccination:** Effective but often economically not feasible due to high turnover of pigs (slaughter).
*   **Ecological Management:** Using cattle as "mosquito diverters" (zooprophylaxis).
