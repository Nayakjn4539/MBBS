# [[PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IN OBSTETRICS, PAEDIATRICS AND GERIATRICS]] > Define Maternal mortality ratio and maternal mortality rate. Describe the important cultural and social factor affecting infant mortality.

### Definitions of Maternal Mortality

**1. Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)**
*   **Definition:** MMR is the number of [[maternal deaths]] during a given time period per **100,000 live births** during the same time period.
*   **Significance:** It quantifies the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live births. It essentially captures the risk of mortality associated with a single pregnancy or a single birth.
*   **Nature:** Technically, it is a **Ratio** because the numerator (maternal deaths) is not a part of the denominator (live births).
*   **Formula:**
    $$MMR = \frac{\text{Number of Maternal Deaths}}{\text{Number of Live Births}} \times 100,000$$

**2. Maternal Mortality Rate (MMRate)**
*   **Definition:** MMRate is the number of maternal deaths divided by **person-years lived by women of reproductive age** (usually 15–49 years) in a population.
*   **Significance:** It reflects not only the risk of maternal death per pregnancy/birth but also the **level of fertility** in the population.
*   **Nature:** It is a true **Rate** as the denominator represents the population at risk (women of reproductive age).
*   **Formula:**
    $$MMRate = \frac{\text{Number of Maternal Deaths}}{\text{Women of Reproductive Age (15-49 years)}} \times 1000 \text{ (usually)}$$

### Cultural and Social Factors Affecting Infant Mortality

Infant Mortality Rate ([[IMR]]) is a sensitive indicator of the socioeconomic development and health status of a community. Cultural and social factors play a dominant role, particularly in the post-neonatal period (1–12 months).

#### 1. Cultural and Religious Factors
*   **Breast-feeding Practices:**
    *   Breast milk contains natural immunizing agents (e.g., [[IgA]]) and nutrition.
    *   **Adverse Practice:** Early weaning or artificial bottle feeding in unhygienic conditions significantly increases IMR due to gastroenteritis and malnutrition. Depriving the newborn of **colostrum** (first milk) is a harmful custom in parts of India.
*   **Religion and Caste:**
    *   Differences in IMR among groups often reflect socio-cultural patterns of living, including habits regarding cleanliness, eating, and child-rearing.
*   **Brutal Habits and Customs:**
    *   Certain traditional practices directly endanger the infant:
        *   **Branding** the skin.
        *   Application of **cow dung** to the cut end of the umbilical cord (causes [[Neonatal Tetanus]]).
        *   Frequent purgation.
        *   Putting oil into ears/nose.

#### 2. Social Factors
*   **Age of Mother (Early Marriage):**
    *   Infant mortality is higher when the mother is very young (teenagers <19 years). This is linked to the social custom of early marriage in many developing regions.
*   **Sex of the Child (Gender Bias):**
    *   **"Female Deficit Syndrome":** In many societies, the birth of a female child is unwelcome. Female infants often receive less attention regarding nutrition and medical care compared to males.
    *   Consequently, while neonatal mortality may be higher in boys (biological fragility), **post-neonatal mortality** is often higher in girls due to neglect.
*   **Maternal Education:**
    *   This is a key determinant. Illiteracy is a barrier to health improvement. Educated mothers tend to marry later, delay childbearing, use family planning, and utilize health services better.
*   **Quality of Mothering:**
    *   The "art of child care" (mothercraft) significantly impacts survival. Even in poverty, an efficient mother with good parenting skills can reduce risks.
*   **Broken Families and Illegitimacy:**
    *   IMR is higher in families where parents are separated or the child is born out of wedlock, as the child is often socially "unwanted" and lacks adequate care.
*   **Bad Environmental Sanitation:**
    *   Lack of safe water, poor drainage, overcrowding, and insect breeding (often linked to low social status) expose infants to fatal infections like diarrhea and pneumonia.
*   **Quality of Health Care (Indigenous Dais):**
    *   A high percentage of deliveries in rural areas are conducted by untrained traditional birth attendants ([[Dais]]) who may use unhygienic methods, leading to infections like sepsis and tetanus.

### Mnemonics for Factors Affecting IMR

**"BEST MOM Cares"**

*   **B**reastfeeding (practices, colostrum avoidance)
*   **E**ducation (Maternal literacy)
*   **S**ex of child (Gender bias/Neglect of female child)
*   **T**raditions (Customs like branding, cow dung on cord)
*   **M**arriage Age (Early marriage/Teenage pregnancy)
*   **O**ther factors (Broken families, Illegitimacy)
*   **M**othering Quality (Child-rearing skills)
*   **C**are (Untrained Dais/Lack of health services)

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Preventive Strategy:** Understanding these social factors allows for targeted interventions such as **Female Literacy** programs and training of **Traditional Birth Attendants** ([[TBA]]) which are more effective than purely medical interventions in reducing post-neonatal mortality.
*   **Risk Approach:** Identifying "At Risk" families (e.g., teenage mothers, lower socioeconomic status) helps health workers prioritize home visits and care.
