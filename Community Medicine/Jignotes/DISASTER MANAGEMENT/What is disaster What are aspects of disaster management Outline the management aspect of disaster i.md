# [[DISASTER MANAGEMENT]] > What is disaster? What are aspects of disaster management? Outline the management aspect of disaster impact in a flood prone area.

### Definition of Disaster

A **[[Disaster]]** is defined as an occurrence that causes damage, ecological disruption, loss of human life, or deterioration of health and health services on a scale sufficient to warrant an extraordinary response from outside the affected community or area,.

According to the **Disaster Management Act 2005 of India**, a disaster is a catastrophe, mishap, calamity, or grave occurrence arising from natural or man-made causes, resulting in substantial loss of life, human suffering, or damage to property and environment, which is **beyond the coping capacity of the community** of the affected area.

> **Clinical Relevance:** A practical definition by Colin Grant states that a disaster is an event causing injury or illness simultaneously to at least **30 people** who require hospital emergency treatment.

### Aspects of Disaster Management

Disaster management is a continuous, dynamic process involving a cycle of activities. The three fundamental aspects are:

1.  **Disaster Response:** Immediate reaction to the event to save lives and minimize damage.
2.  **Disaster Preparedness:** Long-term measures to strengthen the capacity to manage emergencies (e.g., stockpiling, training, warning systems).
3.  **Disaster Mitigation:** Measures designed to prevent hazards from causing an emergency or to lessen likely effects (e.g., building codes, flood embankments).

### Management of Disaster Impact in a Flood-Prone Area

The management of the **impact phase** is critical and follows a logical sequence. In a flood-prone area, specific attention must be paid to water-borne diseases and vector control.

#### 1. Search, Rescue, and First Aid
*   Organized relief services may take time to arrive. Most immediate help comes from uninjured survivors.
*   **Action:** Immediate mobilization of local boats/transport to move vulnerable people (children, elderly, sick) to higher ground.

#### 2. Triage (Classification of Victims)
In mass casualties, the principle of "first come, first treated" is **NOT** followed. [[Triage]] rapidly classifies the injured based on the severity of injuries and likelihood of survival.

**The Four Color Code System,:**

| Color | Priority | Condition | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Red** | **High (I)** | Life-threatening but treatable (e.g., tension pneumothorax, severe hemorrhage) | Immediate resuscitation/surgery within 6 hours. |
| **Yellow** | **Medium (II)** | Serious but stable | Possible surgery/resuscitation within 24 hours. |
| **Green** | **Low (III)** | Minor injuries | Ambulatory patients; can wait. |
| **Black** | **Least (IV)** | Dead or Moribund (survival unlikely even with care) | Identification and dignified handling. |

> *   **R**ed (Immediate)
> *   **Y**ellow (Urgent)
> *   **G**reen (Ambulatory/Minor)
> *   **B**lack (Dead)

#### 3. Tagging and Identification
*   All patients must be identified with tags stating name, age, place of origin, triage category, and initial treatment.
*   **Dead bodies:** Identification is crucial. In floods, bodies can contaminate water sources, so proper disposal/burial is a sanitary priority,.

#### 4. Hospital Treatment and Medical Relief
*   **Primary Phase (0–6 hours):** First aid and emergency medical care.
*   **Secondary Phase (6–24 hours):** Transportation to hospitals, sanitation setup, and vaccination (Tetanus toxoid).
*   **Tertiary Phase (1–60 days):** Rehabilitation, food, and shelter assistance.

#### 5. Environmental Health Management (Specific to Floods)

**A. Water Supply (Highest Priority)**
*   The foremost step in disease prevention after a flood is **[[Chlorination]]** of all water bodies.
*   Ensure residual chlorine levels are maintained at **> 0.7 mg/L** (ppm).
*   In rural areas, bleaching powder should be used for wells.

**B. Excreta Disposal**
*   Floodwaters often contaminate sewage systems.
*   Provision of emergency latrines and trench latrines is vital to break the fecal-oral transmission route,.

**C. Vector Control**
*   Floods flush out breeding sites initially, but stagnant water later creates breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
*   **Risks:** [[Malaria]], [[Dengue]], and [[Japanese Encephalitis]].
*   **Action:** Spraying of insecticides, anti-larval measures, and use of insecticidal bed nets.

#### 6. Disease Surveillance and Control
*   **Gastroenteritis:** The most commonly reported disease in the post-disaster phase.
*   **Leptospirosis:** High risk in flood areas due to rat urine contamination in water. Doxycycline prophylaxis may be distributed.
*   **Snake Bites:** Common in floods as reptiles seek higher ground. Anti-snake venom (ASV) must be stocked.
*   **Respiratory Infections:** Due to overcrowding in relief camps.

#### 7. Vaccination Policy in Disasters
*   **Routine Mass Vaccination:** Generally **discouraged** for Cholera or Typhoid as they divert resources and have limited immediate impact,.
*   **Measles:** Vaccination is a **high priority** for children in overcrowded camps as measles can be lethal in malnourished populations.
*   **Tetanus:** Tetanus Toxoid (TT) given to injured persons.

#### 8. Nutrition
*   [[Vitamin A deficiency]] is common post-disaster due to poor diet and diarrhea. Supplementation is required.
*   Food safety must be monitored to prevent food poisoning outbreaks in camps.
