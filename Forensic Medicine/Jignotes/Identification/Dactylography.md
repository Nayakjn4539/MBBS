# [[Identification]] > Dactylography

### Dactylography (Fingerprints)

**Dactylography** (also known as **Dactyloscopy**, **Galton System**, or **Dermatoglyphics**) is the science of identification of an individual based on the impression of papillary ridges of the fingertips. It is considered the **gold standard** for personal identification.

### History and Principles
*   **Origin:** The system was first introduced by **Sir William Herschel** in the Hooghly district of Bengal, India (1858).
*   **Systematization:** Scientifically developed by **Sir Francis Galton** and classified by **Sir Edward Henry**.
*   **Fundamental Principles:**
    1.  **Uniqueness (Individuality):** No two fingers found to have identical patterns, not even in [[Identical Twins]] (Monozygotic). The probability of two persons having the same fingerprint is 1 in 64 billion.
    2.  **Permanence (Immutability):** The ridges are formed between the **12th and 24th week** of [[Intrauterine Life]] and remain unchanged throughout life until destroyed by decomposition of the skin after death.
    3.  **Universality:** All individuals carry these patterns.

### Classification of Fingerprint Patterns (Henry-Galton System)
The patterns are classified based on the arrangement of ridges, **Deltas** (triangular area where ridges diverge), and **Cores** (central point).

| Pattern Type | Frequency | Characteristics | Sub-types |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Loops** | **60–70%** (Most Common) | Ridges enter from one side, recurve, and exit from the same side. **One Delta.** | • **Ulnar Loop:** Opens towards little finger.<br>• **Radial Loop:** Opens towards thumb. |
| **Whorls** | **25–35%** | Ridges make a complete circuit (spiral or circular). **Two Deltas.** | • Concentric<br>• Spiral<br>• Double loop |
| **Arches** | **6–7%** | Ridges run from one side to the other with a rise in the center. **No Delta.** | • **Plain Arch:** Wave-like.<br>• **Tented Arch:** Sharp spike in center. |
| **Composite** | **1–2%** (Least Common) | Combination of patterns. | • Central pocket loops<br>• Accidentals |

### Types of Fingerprints at Crime Scene
1.  **Visible Prints (Patent):** Visible to the naked eye. Made by fingers stained with blood, ink, grease, or dirt.
2.  **Plastic Prints (Molded):** Indentations left on soft, yielding surfaces like wax, soap, butter, putty, or fresh paint.
3.  **Latent Prints (Hidden):** Invisible to the naked eye. Formed by sweat, oils, or amino acids from the skin ridges. These require developing techniques to be visualized.

### Development of Latent Prints
*   **Physical Methods:**
    *   **Powder dusting:** Black powder (charcoal/graphite) for light surfaces; Grey/Aluminum powder for dark/glass surfaces; Fluorescent powders.
*   **Chemical Methods:**
    *   **[[Ninhydrin]]:** Reacts with amino acids to produce a **purple** color (Ruhemann’s purple). Good for paper/documents.
    *   **Silver Nitrate:** Reacts with chlorides in sweat to form silver chloride (black upon light exposure).
    *   **Iodine Fuming:** Absorbed by fatty acids to produce a yellowish-brown print.
    *   **Cyanoacrylate (Superglue) Fuming:** Polymerizes on the print to form a hard, white deposit.
*   **Advanced Methods:** Lasers, UV light, Metal deposition vacuum.

### Recording of Fingerprints
**A. In Living Persons**
*   **Plain Impression:** Fingers are pressed flat on the paper (used to check the sequence).
*   **Rolled Impression:** The finger is rolled from nail edge to nail edge to capture the entire ridge surface (used for detailed analysis).

**B. In Dead Bodies ([[Autopsy]] Procedures)**
*   **Fresh Body:** Fingers are cleaned, dried, and inked. Rolled with the help of a spoon or spatula.
*   **Rigor Mortis:** The flexion of fingers makes it difficult. The flexor tendons at the wrist may need to be incised to straighten the fingers.
*   **Shriveled/Wrinkled Fingers (Washerwoman's hands):**
    *   Inject **Glycerin**, warm water, or liquid paraffin into the finger pulp to restore turgidity.
*   **Decomposed Bodies:**
    *   If the epidermis is peeling (degloving), the skin of the finger can be carefully removed.
    *   The doctor can wear the skin of the deceased's finger like a glove over their own gloved finger to take the print.
    *   Alternatively, the skin is mounted on a test tube or preserved in formalin for hardening before printing.

### Comparison and Identification
*   Identification is **not** based on the general pattern (Loop vs Whorl) but on **Ridge Characteristics (Minutiae)**.
*   **Minutiae details:** Ridge endings, bifurcations, lakes (enclosures), islands (dots), spurs, and crossovers.
*   **Standard of Proof:**
    *   Historically, **12 to 16 matching points** were considered conclusive proof in India and UK.
    *   Currently, there is no fixed minimum number; the expert's holistic opinion based on quality and quantity (Ridgeology) is accepted by courts.
*   **AFIS:** [[Automated Fingerprint Identification System]] is used for computerized storage and matching.

### Medicolegal Importance
1.  **Absolute Identity:** It is the surest sign of identification for living and dead.
2.  **Criminal Record:** Links suspects to crime scenes and tracks recidivism (previous convictions).
3.  **Mass Disasters:** Identifying victims where facial features are destroyed.
4.  **Exchange Principle:** Based on **Locard’s Exchange Principle** (contact leaves traces).
5.  **Missing Persons:** Identification of amnesiacs or lost children.

### Conditions Affecting Fingerprints
*   **Permanent Impairment:**
    *   **Leprosy:** Erosion of cristae.
    *   **Deep Burns/Cuts:** If the injury reaches the **dermis**, the scar formed becomes a permanent identifying feature.
    *   **Electric Injury.**
    *   **Radiation Exposure.**
*   **Temporary Impairment:**
    *   Eczema, Dermatitis, or manual labor (bricklaying) may obscure ridges temporarily; they reappear after healing.
*   **Adermatoglyphia:** A rare genetic disorder (immigration delay disease) where individuals are born without fingerprints.

### Related Concepts
1.  **[[Poroscopy]] (Locard):** Study of the number, size, and arrangement of sweat pores on the ridges. (20-40 pores/mm). Useful if only a fragment of a fingerprint is found.
2.  **Edgeoscopy:** Study of the shapes of the edges of the ridges.
3.  **Cheiloscopy:** Study of lip prints (Quisquil).
4.  **Podogram:** Footprints (useful in newborn identification).
