# [[DEMOGRAPHY AND FAMILY PLANNING]] > Sample registration system provides more reliable estimates of birth and death rates at the national and state level than other existing systems.

### Sample Registration System (SRS)

The [[Sample Registration System]] (SRS) is the largest demographic sample survey in India. It was initiated by the Office of the **Registrar General of India** in 1964-65 on a pilot basis and became fully operational in **1969-70**. It serves as the most reliable source of information on **fertility** and **mortality** indicators at the National and State levels.

### Why is SRS considered more reliable?
Unlike the [[Civil Registration System]] (CRS), which suffers from gross under-reporting due to illiteracy and lack of public awareness, or the **Census** which provides data only once in 10 years, the SRS provides continuous, reliable annual estimates. Its reliability stems from its unique **Dual Record System**.

#### The Mechanism: Dual Record System
The SRS minimizes errors of omission and duplication through a two-way check system:

1.  **Continuous Enumeration:** A resident part-time enumerator (often a local school teacher or [[Anganwadi worker]]) maintains a continuous record of births and deaths as they occur in the sample unit.
2.  **Retrospective Survey:** An independent full-time supervisor conducts a survey every **6 months** to list births and deaths that occurred during the preceding half-year.
3.  **Matching and Verification:** The data from the enumerator and the supervisor are matched.
    *   **Matched events:** Accepted as correct.
    *   **Unmatched/Partially matched events:** Subjected to **field re-verification** to identify the correct status.

### Components of SRS
The system covers the entire country (Rural and Urban) and involves the following steps:
1.  **Baseline Survey:** To obtain the usual resident population of the sample area.
2.  **Longitudinal Enumeration:** Continuous recording of vital events by the enumerator.
3.  **Independent Half-Yearly Survey:** By the supervisor to update the house list and check for missed events.
4.  **Matching:** Comparison of the two records.
5.  **Field Verification:** Of discrepancies to get an unduplicated count.

### Vital Rates Provided by SRS
The SRS provides annual estimates for:
*   [[Crude Birth Rate]] (CBR)
*   [[Crude Death Rate]] (CDR)
*   [[Infant Mortality Rate]] (IMR)
*   [[Maternal Mortality Ratio]] (MMR)
*   Total Fertility Rate (TFR)
*   Natural Growth Rate

**Clinical Relevance:**
The SRS data is crucial for monitoring the progress of national health goals, such as the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)** related to reducing [[Maternal Mortality]] and [[Child Mortality]]. It helps health administrators track the effectiveness of interventions like the **Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY)**.

### Verbal Autopsy in SRS
Since 2004, the SRS has incorporated **Verbal Autopsy** instruments to determine the **Cause of Death**.
*   In rural areas where medical certification of cause of death is low, lay diagnosis reporting (Post Death Verbal Autopsy) helps build statistics on the most probable causes of death.
*   This is termed **RHIME** (Representative, Re-sampled, Routine Household Interview of Mortality with Medical Evaluation).

### Comparison: SRS vs. Civil Registration System (CRS)

| Feature | Sample Registration System (SRS) | Civil Registration System (CRS) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Coverage** | Sample population (Representative) | Whole population (Theoretical) |
| **Reliability** | **High** (Due to dual check) | **Low** (High under-reporting) |
| **Methodology** | Dual Record System (Continuous + Survey) | Passive reporting (Legal obligation) |
| **Objective** | To provide **rates** (IMR, CBR, CDR) | To provide legal documents (Birth/Death Certificates) |
| **Agency** | Registrar General of India | State Governments/Municipalities |

### Mnemonic for SRS Reliability
**"SRS is DUAL"**
*   **D** - **Dual** Record System
*   **U** - **Unbiased** estimates (due to cross-checking)
*   **A** - **Annual** updates (unlike Census)
*   **L** - **Large** scale sample (Representative)
