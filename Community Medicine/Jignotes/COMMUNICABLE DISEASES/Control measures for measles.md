# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Control measures for measles

The control of [[Measles]] relies on a multi-pronged approach focusing on breaking the chain of transmission, protecting the susceptible host, and managing cases to prevent complications.

### **1. Active Immunization (Vaccination)**
Vaccination is the cornerstone of measles control. The goal is to achieve an immunization coverage of over 95% to establish [[Herd Immunity]].

*   **Vaccine Type:** Live Attenuated Vaccine (Freeze-dried).
*   **Strains Used:** [[Edmonston-Zagreb strain]] (Most common in India), Moraten, or Schwarz strains.
*   **Dose & Route:** 0.5 ml, Subcutaneous (SC).
*   **Site:** Right upper arm.
*   **Diluent:** Sterile Distilled Water (Must be used within 4 hours of reconstitution to prevent [[Toxic Shock Syndrome]]).
*   **Storage:** +2°C to +8°C (Cold Chain is vital).

**National Immunization Schedule (NIS):**
*   **1st Dose:** At 9 completed months (MR-1).
*   **2nd Dose:** At 16–24 months (MR-2).
    *   *Note:* The second dose is crucial to protect children who did not seroconvert after the first dose (Primary Vaccine Failure).

**Contraindications:**
*   **Pregnancy** (Theoretical risk to fetus).
*   **Severe Immunosuppression** (e.g., HIV with severe immunosuppression, corticosteroid therapy).
*   **Severe acute illness** (Minor illnesses like cold/diarrhea are NOT contraindications).

### **2. Management of Cases & Vitamin A Supplementation**
Since there is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, management focuses on supportive care and preventing complications like blindness and pneumonia.

**Vitamin A Prophylaxis Strategy:**
Measles depletes Vitamin A stores, leading to [[Xerophthalmia]], keratomalacia, and blindness. Supplementation reduces mortality and morbidity.

**Table: Vitamin A Dosage Schedule for Measles Cases**

| Age Group | Dose (Oral) | Timing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **< 6 months** | 50,000 IU | Immediately on diagnosis |
| **6 – 11 months** | 1,00,000 IU | Immediately on diagnosis |
| **≥ 12 months** | 2,00,000 IU | Immediately on diagnosis |

*   **Repeat Dose:** The same dose is repeated the **next day**.
*   **Third Dose:** If clinical signs of Vitamin A deficiency (e.g., Bitot's spots) are present, a third dose is given **4-6 weeks later**.

---

### **3. Isolation of Cases**
Isolation is difficult because the disease is most infectious during the prodromal phase (before the rash appears).
*   **Standard Isolation:** Cases should be isolated for **7 days after the onset of rash** to prevent transmission to susceptible contacts.
*   **Hospital Setting:** Respiratory isolation is required.

---

### **4. Management of Contacts**
Speed is essential when managing susceptible contacts exposed to a case.

1.  **Active Immunization (Vaccine):**
    *   Give the live measles vaccine within **3 days (72 hours)** of exposure.
    *   The incubation period of vaccine-induced measles (7 days) is shorter than natural measles (10 days), allowing the vaccine to provide protection.

2.  **Passive Immunization (Immunoglobulin):**
    *   Indicated for those for whom the vaccine is contraindicated (e.g., pregnant women, immunocompromised, infants <6 months).
    *   **Agent:** Human Normal [[Immunoglobulin]] (Ig).
    *   **Timing:** Must be given within **3-4 days** of exposure.
    *   **Dose:** 0.25 ml/kg body weight.
    *   *Note:* Do not give the vaccine until 8-12 weeks after administering Ig.

### **5. Outbreak Control Measures**
If an outbreak occurs:
*   **Isolation:** Isolate cases for 7 days post-rash onset.
*   **Prompt Immunization:** Vaccinate all susceptible contacts immediately.
*   **Special Vaccination:** During outbreaks, a supplementary dose (**Measles-0**) can be given to infants aged **6–9 months**. However, this does not count as the primary dose; the routine 9-month dose must still be given after a gap of at least 4 weeks.

### **6. Strategy for Elimination**
The WHO strategy for measles elimination involves three components:
1.  **Catch-up:** One-time nationwide campaign to vaccinate all children (9 months to 14 years) regardless of history.
2.  **Keep-up:** Maintaining routine immunization coverage of >95% for each birth cohort.
3.  **Follow-up:** Subsequent campaigns every 2-4 years to target new birth cohorts.
