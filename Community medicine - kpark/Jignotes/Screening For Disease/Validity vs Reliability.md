# [[Screening For Disease]] > Validity vs Reliability

# Validity vs. Reliability in Screening Tests

In the evaluation of any [[Screening Test]], two fundamental attributes must be assessed to ensure the test is useful for public health application: **Reliability** (Precision) and **Validity** (Accuracy).

### 1. Reliability (Precision)
Reliability refers to the ability of a test to produce **consistent results** when repeated more than once on the same individual or material, under the same conditions,,.

*   **Synonyms:** [[Repeatability]], Reproducibility, Consistency, Precision,,.
*   **Concept:** It indicates the degree of stability of the test results. Ideally, a test should yield the same result every time it is administered to the same subject.
*   **Measurement:**
    *   **Continuous data:** Measured by the [[Coefficient of Variation]].
    *   **Binary/Qualitative data:** Measured by **Percent Agreement** or the [[Kappa Statistic]] (agreement beyond chance),.

#### Factors Affecting Reliability (Sources of Variation)
To improve reliability, one must control the following sources of error,,:

1.  **Observer Variation:**
    *   **Intra-observer variation:** The *same* observer gets different results on the same subject at different times (e.g., reading a BP cuff differently twice).
    *   **Inter-observer variation:** *Different* observers get different results on the same subject (e.g., two radiologists interpreting the same X-ray differently).
2.  **Biological (Subject) Variation:**
    *   Fluctuations in the physiological state of the patient (e.g., BP changes with time of day, meals).
    *   **Regression to the Mean:** The tendency for extreme values (very high or low) to move closer to the average upon repeat measurement.
3.  **Technical (Method) Errors:**
    *   Defective instruments, erroneous calibration, or faulty reagents.

### 2. Validity (Accuracy)
Validity refers to the extent to which the test **accurately measures** what it purports to measure,,. It is the ability of the test to separate those who have the disease from those who do not.

*   **Synonym:** [[Accuracy]],.
*   **Concept:** It reflects the "truth" of the test results. Accuracy determines how close a measured value is to the **actual (true) value**.
*   **Confirmation:** Validity is determined by comparing the screening test results against a [[Gold Standard]] (a diagnostic test or procedure known to be the absolute truth, e.g., Biopsy for cancer),.

#### Components of Validity
Validity has two main components,:
1.  **[[Sensitivity]]:** The ability of the test to correctly identify those **with** the disease (True Positive Rate).
2.  **[[Specificity]]:** The ability of the test to correctly identify those **without** the disease (True Negative Rate).

*(Note: Sensitivity and Specificity are inherent properties of the test itself)*.

### Comparison: Reliability vs. Validity

| Feature | Reliability | Validity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Question** | Does the test give the **same result** repeatedly? | Does the test measure the **true value**? |
| **Synonyms** | Precision, Repeatability, Consistency, | Accuracy, Truth, |
| **Type of Error** | Inversely related to **Random Error** | Inversely related to **Systematic Error (Bias)**, |
| **Evaluation Metrics** | Coefficient of Variation, Kappa Statistic, Standard Deviation | Sensitivity, Specificity, Predictive Values, |
| **Relationship** | A test can be reliable without being valid (consistent wrong results). | A test cannot be valid if it is unreliable (unpredictable results). |

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Calibration:** A BP apparatus that always reads 10 mmHg higher than actual is **Reliable** (consistent) but **Not Valid** (inaccurate) due to systematic error.
*   **Diagnostic Strategy:** High reliability is needed to monitor changes over time (e.g., serial blood glucose). High validity is needed to confirm a diagnosis (e.g., Fasting Plasma Glucose vs. Urine Sugar).
*   **Blinding:** In research, blinding is used to reduce observer bias and improve internal [[Validity]].

### Mnemonics

*   **R**eliability = **R**epeatability (or **R**eproducibility).
    *   *Think:* "The **R**esults **R**eturn the same."
*   **V**alidity = **V**eracity (Truth).
    *   *Think:* "Does it **V**erify the **V**illain (disease)?"
