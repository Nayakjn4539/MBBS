# [[Nutrition And Health]] > Food Hygiene and Milk Pasteurization

### Food Hygiene

**Definition**
[[Food hygiene]] is defined as all conditions and measures that are necessary during the production, processing, storage, distribution, and preparation of food to ensure that it is safe, sound, wholesome, and fit for human consumption.

**Primary Aim**
To prevent [[food poisoning]] and other food-borne illnesses.

**Key Components of Food Hygiene**
1.  **Milk Hygiene:** Ensuring safety from udder to consumer.
2.  **Meat Hygiene:** Proper ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection of animals; sanitary slaughterhouses.
3.  **Sanitation of Eating Places:** Location away from filth/open drains, impervious floors, rat-proof/fly-proof storage, and independent safe water supply.
4.  **Food Handlers:** Periodic medical examination (to rule out carriers of typhoid, dysentery, etc.), personal hygiene (clean hands/nails, head covering), and health education.

### Milk Hygiene

Milk is an efficient vehicle for a variety of disease agents. The sources of infection can be:
*   **The Dairy Animal:** Endogenous infection.
*   **Human Handler:** Exogenous contamination.
*   **The Environment:** Contaminated vessels, polluted water, flies, and dust.

#### Milk-Borne Diseases
A Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee classified milk-borne diseases as follows:

| Category | Diseases |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Infections of Animals transmitted to Man** | **Primary Importance:** <br>• [[Tuberculosis]] (Bovine)<br>• [[Brucellosis]]<br>• Streptococcal infections<br>• Staphylococcal enterotoxin poisoning<br>• [[Salmonellosis]]<br>• [[Q Fever]]<br><br>**Lesser Importance:**<br>• Cowpox<br>• Foot and mouth disease<br>• Anthrax<br>• Leptospirosis |
| **2. Infections Primary to Man (Transmitted via milk)** | • [[Typhoid]] and Paratyphoid fevers<br>• [[Cholera]]<br>• Shigellosis<br>• Enteropathogenic *E. coli*<br>• Diphtheria<br>• Viral Hepatitis (A & E) |

> **Mnemonic for Milk-Borne Diseases (Animal to Man):**
> **T**wo **B**ruised **S**heep **S**tanding **Q**uietly **A**re **C**ute.
> *   **T**B
> *   **B**rucellosis
> *   **S**treptococcal
> *   **S**almonellosis/Staphylococcal
> *   **Q** Fever
> *   **A**nthrax
> *   **C**owpox

**Clinical Relevance:**
In India, boiling milk is a common cultural practice. This effectively kills most pathogens, which is why bovine tuberculosis is rare in humans in India despite high prevalence in cattle. However, consumption of raw milk or products like unpasteurized cheese poses a significant risk for [[Brucellosis]] and Q Fever.

### Pasteurization of Milk

**Definition**
[[Pasteurization]] is the heating of milk to such temperatures and for such periods of time as are required to destroy any pathogens that may be present while causing minimal changes in the composition, flavour, and nutritive value.

**Objectives**
1.   To destroy pathogenic organisms (It kills nearly 90% of bacteria).
2.  To increase the keeping quality (shelf-life) of milk.

*Note: Pasteurization does **not** kill thermoduric bacteria or bacterial spores.*

#### Methods of Pasteurization

| Feature | **Holder (Vat) Method** | **HTST (High Temperature Short Time)** | **UHT (Ultra High Temperature)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Temperature** | 63–66°C (145–150°F) | 72°C (161°F) | 125°C–135°C (257–275°F) |
| **Holding Time** | At least 30 minutes | At least 15 seconds | Few seconds |
| **Process** | Heated and then quickly cooled to 5°C. | Heated rapidly, held, then rapidly cooled to 4°C. | Heated in two stages (2nd under pressure), then rapid cooling. |
| **Usage** | Small/Rural communities. | Most widely used (Large scale). Also called "Flash Pasteurization". | Long shelf life without refrigeration (until opened). |
| **Target Organism** | Killed *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* | Killed *Coxiella burnetii* (Q Fever agent) | Spores are also destroyed. |

#### Tests for Pasteurized Milk

1.  **[[Phosphatase Test]] (Efficiency Test):**
    *   **Principle:** The enzyme phosphatase (naturally present in raw milk) is destroyed at temperatures slightly higher than those required to kill the most heat-resistant pathogen (*Mycobacterium tuberculosis*).
    *   **Result:** If phosphatase is present (Positive test), it implies the milk was not properly pasteurized or was re-contaminated with raw milk.
    *   **Interpretation:** A negative phosphatase test indicates satisfactory pasteurization.

2.  **Standard Plate Count (Quality Test):**
    *   Checks the bacteriological quality.
    *   **Limit:** The bacterial count should not exceed **30,000 per ml** of pasteurized milk.

3.  **Coliform Count:**
    *   Coliforms are usually destroyed by pasteurization.
    *   Presence indicates **post-pasteurization contamination** or improper processing.
    *   **Standard:** Coliforms should be **absent** in 1 ml of milk.

4.  **Methylene Blue Reduction Test (MBRT):**
    *   Indirect method to assess the microbial load in *raw milk* before acceptance for pasteurization.
    *   Based on the principle that bacteria consume oxygen; the faster the blue color disappears, the heavier the bacterial load.

#### Boiling vs. Pasteurization

| Parameter | Pasteurization | Boiling |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Temperature** | Controlled (63–72°C) | >100°C |
| **Pathogens** | Kills 90% (Pathogens gone, spores remain) | Kills pathogens + spores (if boiled >5-10 mins) |
| **Nutrient Loss** | Minimal | Significant (Vitamin C and B destruction) |
| **Taste/Flavor** | Unchanged | Altered (Caramelized) |
| **Proteins** | Lactalbumin/Lactoglobulin not coagulated | Coagulated (form scum) |
