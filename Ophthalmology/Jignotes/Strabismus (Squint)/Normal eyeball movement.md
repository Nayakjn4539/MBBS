# Physiology of Normal Eyeball Movement

### I. Anatomy of Extraocular Muscles (EOM)
The movement of the eyeball is controlled by six [[Extraocular Muscles]].
*   **Origin:**
    *   **Four Recti:** Arise from the **Common Tendinous Ring** ([[Annulus of Zinn]]) at the orbital apex.
    *   **Superior Oblique:** Arises from the lesser wing of the sphenoid (superomedial to the annulus).
    *   **Inferior Oblique:** Arises from the orbital plate of the maxilla (floor of the orbit).
*   **Insertion ([[Spiral of Tillaux]]):**
    *   The rectus muscles insert into the [[Sclera]] at varying distances from the limbus.
    *   **Medial Rectus (MR):** 5.5 mm
    *   **Inferior Rectus (IR):** 6.5 mm
    *   **Lateral Rectus (LR):** 6.9 mm
    *   **Superior Rectus (SR):** 7.7 mm
    *   **Obliques:** Insert behind the equator.

### II. Actions of Extraocular Muscles
The action of a muscle depends on the position of the globe relative to the orbit. The eye rotates around three axes (Center of rotation is ~13mm behind the cornea).
1.  **Vertical Axis:** Horizontal movements (Adduction/Abduction).
2.  **Transverse/Horizontal Axis:** Vertical movements (Elevation/Depression).
3.  **Anteroposterior (Sagittal) Axis:** Torsional movements (Intorsion/Extorsion).

#### 1. Horizontal Recti (Simple Action)
*   **Medial Rectus:** Adduction (Pure action).
*   **Lateral Rectus:** Abduction (Pure action).

#### 2. Vertical Recti and Obliques (Complex Action)
These muscles run at an angle to the visual axis in the primary position, leading to secondary and tertiary actions.
*   **Vertical Recti:** Make an angle of **23°** with the visual axis.
*   **Obliques:** Make an angle of **51°** with the visual axis.

**Table: Actions of Extraocular Muscles**

| Muscle | Primary Action | Secondary Action | Tertiary Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Medial Rectus** | Adduction | None | None |
| **Lateral Rectus** | Abduction | None | None |
| **Superior Rectus** | Elevation | Intorsion | Adduction |
| **Inferior Rectus** | Depression | Extorsion | Adduction |
| **Superior Oblique** | Intorsion | Depression | Abduction |
| **Inferior Oblique** | Extorsion | Elevation | Abduction |

> **Mnemonics:**
> *   **SIN:** **S**uperiors are **In**torters (Superior Rectus, Superior Oblique).
> *   **RAD:** **R**ecti are **Ad**ductors (SR, IR, MR).
> *   **IOU:** **I**nferior **O**blique **U**p (Elevation is the primary action in adduction).

#### Clinical Application: Diagnostic Positions of Gaze
To isolate the action of a muscle, the eye must be moved so the visual axis coincides with the muscle axis.
*   **Vertical Recti:** Act as pure elevators/depressors when the eye is **Abducted** (23°).
*   **Obliques:** Act as pure elevators/depressors when the eye is **Adducted** (51°).

*   **Superior Rectus:** Tested in Abduction and Elevation.
*   **Inferior Rectus:** Tested in Abduction and Depression.
*   **Superior Oblique:** Tested in Adduction and Depression.
*   **Inferior Oblique:** Tested in Adduction and Elevation.

### III. Types of Eye Movements

#### A. Uniocular Movements (Ductions)
Movements of a single eye.
1.  **Adduction:** Inward movement.
2.  **Abduction:** Outward movement.
3.  **Supraduction (Elevation):** Upward movement.
4.  **Infraduction (Depression):** Downward movement.
5.  **Incycloduction (Intorsion):** 12 o'clock meridian of cornea moves nasally.
6.  **Excycloduction (Extorsion):** 12 o'clock meridian of cornea moves temporally.

#### B. Binocular Movements
Simultaneous movements of both eyes.

**1. Versions (Conjugate Movements):**
Both eyes move in the **same** direction.
*   **Dextroversion:** Right gaze.
*   **Levoversion:** Left gaze.
*   **Supraversion:** Up gaze.
*   **Infraversion:** Down gaze.
*   **Dextrocycloversion/Levocycloversion:** Torsional movements.

**2. Vergences (Disconjugate Movements):**
Both eyes move in **opposite** directions.
*   **Convergence:** Both eyes move nasally (essential for near vision).
*   **Divergence:** Both eyes move temporally.

### IV. Muscle Relationships and Terminology

*   **Agonist:** The primary muscle moving the eye in a specific direction (e.g., Right LR for right gaze).
*   **Antagonist:** Muscle in the *same eye* acting opposite to the agonist (e.g., Right MR opposes Right LR).
*   **Synergists:** Muscles in the *same eye* moving it in the same direction (e.g., SR and IO are synergists for elevation).
*   **Yoke Muscles (Contralateral Synergists):** A pair of muscles (one in each eye) that produce conjugate movement (e.g., Right LR and Left MR for dextroversion).

**Table: Yoke Muscle Pairs**

| Movement | Yoke Muscle Pair |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Dextroversion (Right Gaze)** | Right [[Lateral Rectus]] + Left [[Medial Rectus]] |
| **Levoversion (Left Gaze)** | Left [[Lateral Rectus]] + Right [[Medial Rectus]] |
| **Dextro-elevation (Up & Right)** | Right [[Superior Rectus]] + Left [[Inferior Oblique]] |
| **Levo-elevation (Up & Left)** | Left [[Superior Rectus]] + Right [[Inferior Oblique]] |
| **Dextro-depression (Down & Right)** | Right [[Inferior Rectus]] + Left [[Superior Oblique]] |
| **Levo-depression (Down & Left)** | Left [[Inferior Rectus]] + Right [[Superior Oblique]] |

### V. Laws of Ocular Motility

#### 1. Hering’s Law of Equal Innervation
*   **Definition:** During any conjugate eye movement, equal and simultaneous innervation flows to the **Yoke Muscles**.
*   **Example:** When looking to the right, the Right LR and Left MR receive equal nerve impulses.
*   **Clinical Implication:** In paralytic squint, the **secondary deviation** (deviation of the normal eye when the paretic eye fixes) is greater than the **primary deviation**. This is because excessive innervation is required to drive the paretic muscle, which is simultaneously sent to the normal yoke muscle (Hering's Law), causing it to overshoot.

#### 2. Sherrington’s Law of Reciprocal Innervation
*   **Definition:** Increased innervation and contraction of an agonist muscle is accompanied by a simultaneous reciprocal decrease in innervation (relaxation) of its **antagonist** muscle in the same eye.
*   **Example:** In right gaze, the Right LR contracts while the Right MR relaxes.
*   **Clinical Implication:** In [[Duane's Retraction Syndrome]], this law is violated (co-contraction of MR and LR leads to globe retraction).

### VI. Supranuclear Control of Gaze

Eye movements are controlled by higher centers in the brainstem and cortex.

#### 1. Saccades (Fast Movements)
*   **Function:** Rapidly refixate the fovea on a new target.
*   **Origin:** **Frontal Eye Field (FEF)** (Area 8) -> Contralateral PPRF.
*   **Control:** Contralateral control (Right FEF generates saccades to the Left).

#### 2. Smooth Pursuit (Slow Movements)
*   **Function:** Maintain fixation on a moving target.
*   **Origin:** **Occipital Cortex** (Peristriate cortex).
*   **Control:** Ipsilateral control.

#### 3. Brainstem Gaze Centers
*   **Horizontal Gaze Center:** **PPRF** ([[Paramedian Pontine Reticular Formation]]) in the Pons.
    *   Stimulates ipsilateral VI nerve nucleus and contralateral III nerve nucleus (via [[Medial Longitudinal Fasciculus]] - MLF).
*   **Vertical Gaze Center:** **riMLF** ([[Rostral Interstitial Nucleus of Medial Longitudinal Fasciculus]]) in the Midbrain.

#### 4. Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR)
*   **Function:** Stabilizes retinal images during head movement (Doll's eye reflex).
*   **Origin:** Semicircular canals $\rightarrow$ Vestibular nuclei $\rightarrow$ Ocular motor nuclei.
