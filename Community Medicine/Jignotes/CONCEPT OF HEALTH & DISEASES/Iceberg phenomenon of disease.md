# [[CONCEPT OF HEALTH & DISEASES]] > Iceberg phenomenon of disease

# Iceberg Phenomenon of Disease

### **Concept**
The **[[Iceberg Phenomenon]]** is a classic epidemiological concept used to describe the distribution of disease in a community. It visualizes disease severity and detection, emphasizing that what is seen by the healthcare system is often just a small fraction of the actual burden.

### **Components of the Iceberg**

**1. The Floating Tip**
*   Represents the **[[Clinical cases]]** (symptomatic cases).
*   These are the cases that are diagnosed and seen by the physician.
*   It constitutes a relatively small proportion of the total diseased population.

**2. The Waterline**
*   Represents the **demarcation** between apparent (clinical) and inapparent (subclinical) disease.

**3. The Submerged Portion**
*   Represents the **[[Hidden mass of disease]]**.
*   This includes:
    *   **[[Pre-symptomatic cases]]** (e.g., early cancer).
    *   **[[Sub-clinical cases]]** (e.g., Polio, Hepatitis A).
    *   **[[Inapparent infection]]** (asymptomatic).
    *   **[[Carriers]]** (e.g., Typhoid).
    *   **Undiagnosed cases**.
*   This portion is **invisible** to the clinician but is the primary concern of the **[[Epidemiologist]]** and **Preventive Medicine**.

### **Key Characteristics**

*   **Disease Spectrum:** It corresponds to the **[[Biologic Spectrum of Disease]]** or "gradient of infection".
*   **Significance:**
    *   The hidden part of the iceberg acts as an important, undiagnosed **[[Reservoir of infection]]** in the community.
    *   Detection and control of this submerged portion is a major challenge in modern preventive medicine.
*   **Clinician vs. Epidemiologist:**
    *   The clinician is concerned with the **tip** (treating the sick).
    *   The epidemiologist is concerned with the **submerged portion** (identifying the hidden cases via [[Screening]] to prevent spread).

### **Examples**

*   **Infectious Diseases:**
    *   **[[Polio]]**: For every 1 clinical case, there are approx. 1,000 subclinical cases in children.
    *   **Hepatitis A & E**: High rate of anicteric (no jaundice) infection.
    *   **[[Japanese Encephalitis]]**: Ratio of overt disease to inapparent infection is 1:300 to 1:1000.
*   **Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs):**
    *   **[[Hypertension]]**: Often called an "Iceberg disease" due to the **[[Rule of Halves]]** (only half the people with high BP are aware of it).
    *   **Diabetes**, **Anemia**, **Malnutrition**, and **Mental Illness**.

### **Exceptions (Diseases NOT showing Iceberg Phenomenon)**
These are diseases where the infection almost always results in clinically visible illness (what you see is what you get).
*   **[[Rabies]]**
*   **[[Tetanus]]**
*   **[[Measles]]**

> **Note:** These diseases have a high percentage of clinical manifestation and very few subclinical cases.

### **Clinical Relevance & Public Health Application**

1.  **Screening:** The main purpose of screening is to uncover the "submerged" portion of the iceberg.
2.  **Surveillance:** Helps in understanding the true burden of disease beyond hospital records.
3.  **Clinician's Fallacy:** Clinicians may develop an inaccurate view of the nature of a disease because they only see the severe cases (the tip), missing the broader spectrum present in the community.

### **Mnemonic**

To remember diseases that **DO NOT** show the Iceberg Phenomenon (The exceptions):

**"MTR"** (Like the train station or 'Matter')
*   **M** - **M**easles
*   **T** - **T**etanus
*   **R** - **R**abies

*(Think: These diseases are like a train wreck—very visible and hard to miss!)*
