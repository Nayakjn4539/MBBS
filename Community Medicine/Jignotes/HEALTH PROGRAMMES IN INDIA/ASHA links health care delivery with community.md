# [[HEALTH PROGRAMMES IN INDIA]] > ASHA links health care delivery with community

### ASHA: The Vital Link Between Health Care Delivery and Community

The **Accredited Social Health Activist** ([[ASHA]]) is a trained female community health activist introduced under the [[National Rural Health Mission (NRHM)]]. She acts as the **central pillar** and the most effective interface between the community and the public health system.

#### 1. Why ASHA is the Ideal Link?
To ensure she is accepted by the community and understands their specific needs, specific selection criteria are mandated:
*   **Resident:** Must be a resident of the village (creates trust and accessibility).
*   **Demographic:** Preferably a woman (married/widowed/divorced) in the age group of **25 to 45 years**.
*   **Literacy:** Formal education up to **Class VIII** (recently updated to Class X in some guidelines) to handle record-keeping.
*   **Selection:** Chosen by and accountable to the **Village Panchayat** (Community ownership).

#### 2. Mechanisms of Linking Health Delivery to Community
ASHA bridges the gap through specific functions that bring health services to the doorstep and mobilize the community to access higher centers.

**A. Facilitator of Health Services**
*   **Mobilization:** She mobilizes the community to access health services at the [[Anganwadi]]/[[Sub-centre]]/Primary Health Centre ([[PHC]]), such as immunization, antenatal check-ups (ANC), and sanitation services.
*   **Escort Function:** She accompanies pregnant women and children requiring treatment to the nearest pre-identified health facility.
*   **Depot Holder:** She makes essential health provisions available directly within the village, acting as a depot holder for:
    *   [[ORS]] packets
    *   Iron Folic Acid ([[IFA]]) tablets
    *   Chloroquine
    *   Disposable delivery kits
    *   Oral Pills and [[Condoms]].

**B. Creator of Awareness (IEC)**
*   She creates awareness on health determinants like nutrition, basic sanitation, and hygienic practices.
*   She counsels women on **birth preparedness**, safe delivery, breastfeeding, complementary feeding, and contraception.

**C. Primary Care Provider**
*   She provides primary medical care for minor ailments like diarrhea, fever, and first aid for minor injuries.
*   She acts as a **DOTS provider** under the [[National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP)]].

#### 3. Role in National Health Programmes (The Link in Action)

| Programme | ASHA's Linking Role |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY)]]** | She identifies beneficiaries, facilitates registration, and escorts pregnant women for **institutional delivery**. She is the specific link worker for JSY. |
| **Home Based Newborn Care ([[HBNC]])** | She visits newborns at home (6 visits for institutional, 7 for home deliveries) to screen for danger signs and refer to the hospital if needed. |
| **Family Planning** | She delivers contraceptives at the doorstep (Home Delivery of Contraceptives scheme). |
| **Disease Control** | She informs the PHC about births, deaths, and unusual outbreaks (e.g., fever with rash) in the community. |

#### 4. Coordination with Other Functionaries
To effectively link the community with the system, ASHA works in coordination with:
*   **[[Anganwadi Worker (AWW)]]:** Collaborates for organizing Health Days and nutrition supplements.
*   **[[Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM)]]:** The ANM holds weekly/fortnightly meetings with ASHA to guide her and update eligible couple registers. The ASHA acts as a bridge between the ANM and the village.

#### 5. Mnemonic for ASHA's Functions
To remember how she links the system: **"ASHAS"**

*   **A** - **A**wareness creator (IEC on health)
*   **S** - **S**upplies (Depot holder for drugs/condoms)
*   **H** - **H**ome Visits (HBNC, escorting patients)
*   **A** - **A**ctivist (Mobilizing community for immunization/ANC)
*   **S** - **S**urveillance (Notifying births/deaths/outbreaks)
