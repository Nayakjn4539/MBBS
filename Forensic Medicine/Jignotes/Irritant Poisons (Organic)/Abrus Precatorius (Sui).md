# [[Irritant Poisons (Organic)]] > Abrus Precatorius (Sui)

### Abrus Precatorius (The Jequirity Bean)

**Synonyms:** Rosary pea, Jequirity, Crab’s eye, Gunchi, Rati, Indian Liquorice.

#### 1. General Characteristics
*   **Source:** Seeds of the plant *Abrus precatorius* (Family: Leguminosae).
*   **Appearance:** The seeds are small, spherical/oval, hard, and glossy.
    *   **Color:** Attractive bright scarlet red with a black spot at one pole (hilum).
    *   **Weight:** consistently **105 mg**. Used by jewelers in the past as a standard weight (**1 Rati**).
*   **Classification:** [[Organic Irritant Poison]] (Vegetable origin).

#### 2. Active Principles
The poisonous part is the **seed**.
*   **[[Abrin]]:** A **[[Toxalbumin]]** (Phytotoxin). It is chemically similar to Ricin (from Castor) but is **10 times more toxic**.
    *   It inhibits protein synthesis and causes agglutination of RBCs (hemolysis).
    *   It is **thermolabile** (destroyed by boiling).
*   **Other components:** Abrine (amino acid), Abralic acid.

> **Note:** Intact seeds, if swallowed, are **non-poisonous** because the hard seed coat prevents the release of the toxin. They pass through the GI tract unchanged. **Crushed seeds are highly toxic.**

#### 3. Preparation of "Sui" (Needles)
This is a unique medicolegal aspect of Abrus poisoning, widely used for cattle poisoning and occasionally for homicide.

**Method of Preparation:**
1.  Seeds are decorticated (outer shell removed).
2.  The kernel is powdered and macerated with water or spirit.
3.  Often mixed with **[[Datura]]**, **[[Opium]]**, and **Onion** to form a paste.
4.  The paste is shaped into sharp, needle-like spikes (approx 1.5 cm long).
5.  These are dried in the sun until hard.
6.  The needles are fitted into a wooden handle or held between fingers.

**Mode of Use:**
*   **Cattle:** The needle is driven into the animal's skin (usually rump or flank) by a heavy blow.
*   **Humans:** The needle is held between fingers, and the victim is slapped or poked, driving the needle into the skin. The needle breaks off and remains embedded, releasing the toxin.

#### 4. Clinical Features

**A. Ingestion (Crushed Seeds)**
Symptoms appear after a latent period (few hours to days):
*   **GIT:** Severe gastroenteritis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea (resembling cholera or arsenic poisoning).
*   **Systemic:** Weakness, cold perspiration, trembling, rapid pulse, convulsions, and collapse.

**B. Injection (Sui Poisoning)**
*   **Local:**
    *   Pain and swelling at the site of injection.
    *   Inflammation, edema, and necrosis (oozing of serosanguinous fluid).
    *   Resembles a **[[Viper Bite]]** lesion.
*   **Systemic:**
    *   The toxin enters circulation causing agglutination of red cells.
    *   Pyrexia, vertigo, generalized convulsions.
    *   Death due to cardiac failure or respiratory paralysis (usually within 3-5 days).

#### 5. Diagnosis: Sui Poisoning vs. Viper Bite
This is a classic exam question.

| Feature | Sui Poisoning (Abrus) | [[Viper Bite]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **History** | No history of snake bite. History of assault/slap. | History of snake bite usually present. |
| **Puncture Marks** | Single puncture mark (needle track). | Two fang marks (2.5 cm apart). |
| **Foreign Body** | Fragment of Sui needle found in the wound. | No foreign body (fangs are rarely left behind). |
| **Local Reaction** | Inflammation and edema present but **no** incoagulable blood. | Intense swelling with oozing of **incoagulable blood**. |
| **Systemic Signs** | Hemolysis, but bleeding diathesis is rare. | Systemic bleeding (hematuria, hematemesis) is common. |
| **Microscopy** | Vegetable cells (abrus) seen in wound debris. | Snake venom antigens detected (ELISA). |

#### 6. Fatal Dose and Period
*   **Fatal Dose:**
    *   **Ingestion:** 1 to 2 crushed seeds (approx. 90–120 mg).
    *   **Injection:** 1/100th of the swallowed dose is fatal.
*   **Fatal Period:** 24 hours to 3–5 days.

#### 7. Treatment
There is no specific antidote readily available (Anti-abrin exists but is rare).

1.  **Decontamination:**
    *   **Ingestion:** Gastric lavage (careful usage), Activated charcoal, Purgatives.
    *   **Injection (Sui):** **Excision** of the injected site to remove the needle fragment and prevent further absorption.
2.  **Alkalinization of Urine:** Administer Sodium Bicarbonate (10g/day) to maintain alkalinity and prevent blockage of renal tubules by agglutinated RBCs (similar to mismatched blood transfusion treatment).
3.  **Injection Anti-abrin:** If available (rare).
4.  **Symptomatic:** IV fluids for shock, diazepam for convulsions.

#### 8. Autopsy Findings
*   **External:**
    *   Fragments of the **Sui needle** may be found deep in the wound (careful dissection required).
    *   Local inflammation, edema, and necrosis at the site.
*   **Internal:**
    *   **Stomach:** Mucosa is congested, inflamed, and may show submucous hemorrhages (cherry red color).
    *   **Intestines:** Hemorrhagic patches.
    *   **Generalized:** Visceral congestion (Liver, Spleen, Kidney).
    *   **Specific:** Hemolysis may be evident.

#### 9. Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Cattle Poisoning:** Most common use. Used by "Chamars" (leather workers) or rivals to kill cattle for hides or revenge.
*   **Homicide:** Rarely used for killing humans via the "Sui" method (slapping).
*   **Accidental:** Common in children due to the attractive color of the seeds (often used in jewelry/necklaces).
*   **Malingering:** Powdered seeds applied to eyes (conjunctivitis) or skin (artificial bruise/abscess) to feign illness.
*   **Arrow Poison:** Used historically by tribals.

**Mnemonic for Abrus Toxicity: "RATI"**
*   **R** - **R**ed seeds with black spot (Rosary pea).
*   **A** - **A**brin (Toxalbumin) / **A**gglutination of RBCs.
*   **T** - **T**reatment includes Urine Alkalinization.
*   **I** - **I**njection (Sui) mimics Viper bite.
