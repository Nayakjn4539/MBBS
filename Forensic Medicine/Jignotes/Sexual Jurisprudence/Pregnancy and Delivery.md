# [[Sexual Jurisprudence]] > Pregnancy and Delivery

### [[Pregnancy]]

Pregnancy is the physiological state of carrying a developing embryo or fetus within the female body. Medicolegally, it is crucial to determine the existence and duration of pregnancy in cases of blackmail, divorce, nullity of marriage, and criminal abortion.

#### I. Diagnosis of Pregnancy in the Living

The signs are classified into three categories based on reliability:

**1. Presumptive Signs (Subjective Symptoms)**
These are uncertain signs, mostly experienced by the woman.
*   **Amenorrhea:** Cessation of menstruation. Most common early symptom but unreliable (can be due to stress, PCOD, anemia).
*   **Morning Sickness:** Nausea and vomiting, usually in the 1st and 2nd month.
*   **Urinary symptoms:** Frequency of micturition due to pressure of the gravid uterus on the bladder (6–12 weeks).
*   **Breast Changes:** Enlargement, tenderness, pigmentation of areola, and prominence of **Montgomery's tubercles** (sebaceous glands).
*   **Quickening:** Perception of fetal movements by the mother (occurs around 14–18 weeks).
*   **Skin Changes:** [[Chloasma]] (pregnancy mask) and Linea nigra.

**2. Probable Signs (Objective Signs)**
These are detected by the doctor during physical examination but are not absolute proof.
*   **Abdominal Enlargement:** Progressive increase in size.
*   **Breast Signs:** Secretion of colostrum (after 3rd month).
*   **Uterine Changes (Signs):**
    *   **[[Hegar's Sign]]:** Softening of the lower uterine segment (isthmus) felt on bimanual examination (6–8 weeks).
    *   **[[Goodell's Sign]]:** Softening of the cervix (feels like lips of mouth vs tip of nose in non-pregnant).
    *   **[[Chadwick's Sign]] (Jacquemier's Sign):** Blue/purple discoloration of the vestibule and anterior vaginal wall due to congestion (after 4th week).
    *   **Palmer's Sign:** Rhythmic uterine contractions felt during bimanual examination (4–8 weeks).
    *   **Piskacek’s Sign:** Asymmetrical enlargement of the uterus (lateral implantation).
    *   **Osiander's Sign:** Increased pulsation felt through the lateral fornices (8 weeks).
*   **[[Braxton-Hicks Contractions]]:** Painless, irregular uterine contractions (after 3rd month).
*   **[[Ballottement]]:** Passive movement of the fetus felt per vagina (internal) or abdomen (external) (4th–5th month).
*   **Uterine Souffle:** Soft blowing murmur synchronous with maternal pulse (placental blood flow).
*   **Biological/Immunological Tests:** Detection of **hCG** in urine/blood (ELISA, RIA). *Note: Can be positive in hydatidiform mole or choriocarcinoma.*

**Mnemonic for Uterine Signs:**
**G**ood **H**ealth **C**an **O**pen **P**aths
*   **G**oodell’s (Soft cervix)
*   **H**ealth (Hegar’s - Soft isthmus)
*   **C**an (Chadwick’s - Blue vagina)
*   **O**pen (Osiander’s - Pulsations)
*   **P**aths (Palmer’s/Piskacek’s)

**3. Positive Signs (Conclusive Proof)**
These are undeniable evidences of pregnancy.
*   **Fetal Heart Sounds (FHS):** Heard via stethoscope/Doppler (distinct from maternal pulse).
*   **Palpation of Fetal Parts:** Distinct head, limbs, and back felt by the examiner.
*   **Active Fetal Movements:** Felt by the examiner.
*   **Radiological Evidence:**
    *   **USG (Ultrasound):** Gestational sac seen at 4–5 weeks; cardiac activity at 6 weeks. *Safest and most accurate.*
    *   **X-ray:** Fetal shadow seen after 14–16 weeks (ossification centers). *Avoided due to radiation hazards.*

#### II. Diagnosis of Pregnancy in the Dead
*   **Gross Examination:** Enlarged uterus, presence of fetus, placenta, and membranes intact or disrupted.
*   **Ovaries:** Presence of **[[Corpus Luteum]]** of pregnancy (larger than corpus luteum of menstruation).
*   **Histopathology:** Identification of chorionic villi or decidual cells in uterine scrapings (useful in early pregnancy/abortion).
*   **Bone changes:** Biological resorption of calcium may be seen.

### [[Delivery]]

Delivery is the expulsion of the products of conception. Medicolegal questions usually arise regarding recent delivery (infanticide, abortion, concealment of birth) or remote delivery (nullity of marriage, inheritance).

#### I. Signs of Recent Delivery in the Living
These signs are prominent within the first few days (puerperium) and fade gradually.

**1. General Condition**
*   Signs of exhaustion, pallor, and weakness.
*   Pulse may be rapid; temperature slightly elevated.

**2. Breasts**
*   Enlarged, full, tense, and nodular.
*   Pigmented areola and prominent Montgomery’s tubercles.
*   **Colostrum** or milk can be expressed.

**3. Abdominal Wall**
*   Lax, loose, and flabby skin with wrinkles.
*   **[[Striae Gravidarum]]:** Fresh, reddish-purple curvilinear marks (stretch marks).
*   **Linea Nigra:** Dark pigmented line from xiphisternum to pubis.

**4. External Genitalia**
*   **Perineum:** Swollen, bruised, lacerated, or sutured (episiotomy wound).
*   **Labia/Vulva:** Edematous and congested.
*   **Fourchette:** Often ruptured in primigravida.

**5. Uterus (Involution)**
*   Palpable per abdomen immediately after delivery.
*   **Fundal Height:**
    *   At umbilicus: Immediately after delivery.
    *   Symphysis pubis: By 10–12 days.
    *   Pelvic organ (not palpable): By 2 weeks.
    *   Normal size: By 6 weeks.

**6. Vaginal Discharge ([[Lochia]])**
Discharge from the uterus consisting of blood, mucus, and necrotic tissue. Essential for estimating time since delivery.

| Type | Days | Appearance/Composition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lochia Rubra** | 1–4 days | Red/Bloody. Contains RBCs, vernix, lanugo, meconium. |
| **Lochia Serosa** | 5–9 days | Paler/Pinkish/Yellow. Contains WBCs, serous fluid. |
| **Lochia Alba** | 10–15 days | Pale white/Turbid. Contains decidual cells, leucocytes, mucus. |

**7. Cervix**
*   Soft, patulous, and admits fingers (2 fingers up to a week).
*   Internal os closes by 2 weeks; external os remains slit-like permanently.

#### II. Signs of Remote Delivery in the Living
Used to determine if a woman has *ever* borne a child.
*   **Breasts:** Lax and pendulous; nipples prominent.
*   **Abdomen:** **[[Striae Albicantes]]** (old, silvery-white, glistening stretch marks).
*   **Perineum:** Old scars of tears or episiotomy; rupture of fourchette.
*   **Vagina:** Smooth walls (loss of rugae), capacious.
*   **Cervix:** External os is **transverse/slit-like** with potential tears (unlike the circular/pin-point os of a nulliparous woman).
*   **Hymen:** Represented by tags of tissue called **[[Carunculae myrtiformes]]**.

#### III. Diagnosis of Delivery in the Dead

**1. Recent Delivery**
*   **Uterus:** Enlarged, thick walls, flabby.
*   **Placental Site:** Raised, rough, nodular area with dark blood clots on the inner surface of the uterus.
    *   Diameter: ~4 cm at 2 weeks, ~2 cm at 6 weeks.
    *   Can be identified up to 8–12 weeks postpartum.
*   **Ovaries:** Corpus luteum of pregnancy (yellow body) is present.
*   **Vessels:** Uterine vessels remain tortuous and dilated.

**2. Remote Delivery**
*   **Uterus:** Normal size but external os is slit-like.
*   **Arteries:** Arteriosclerosis/degenerative changes in uterine arteries (involutional sclerosis).
*   **Ovaries:** Scars of old corpora lutea on the surface.

**Difference between Nulliparous and Parous Uterus**

| Feature | Nulliparous (Virginal) | Parous (Has delivered) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Size** | Smaller (7.5 x 5 x 2.5 cm) | Larger |
| **Cavity** | Triangular, walls convex | Oval/Rounded, walls concave |
| **Cervix (Ext. Os)** | Circular / Pin-point | Transverse / Slit-like |
| **Fundus** | Convex | Flattened / Depressed |
| **Mucosa** | Rugae present | Smooth (Rugae absent/less) |

### Medicolegal Aspects

1.  **Legitimacy:** Determining if a child born is the legitimate offspring of a married couple (Evidence of delivery in mother + DNA).
2.  **Infanticide:** Connecting a woman to an abandoned or killed newborn (Signs of recent delivery).
3.  **Abortion:** Proving pregnancy is a prerequisite to proving criminal abortion.
4.  **Nullity of Marriage:** Based on impotence or sterility (Proof of non-delivery or virginity).
5.  **Divorce:** On grounds of adultery (Pregnancy while husband has no access).
6.  **Compensation:** Higher compensation claimed if a pregnant woman is killed/injured.
7.  **Death Sentence:** Under **Section 416 CrPC**, if a woman sentenced to death is found pregnant, the High Court shall commute the sentence to life imprisonment.
8.  **Pseudocyesis (Phantom Pregnancy):** A psychological condition where a woman believes she is pregnant with signs (amenorrhea, abdominal fat), but the uterus is empty.
