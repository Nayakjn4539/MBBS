# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Discuss resurgence of diphtheria disease and its control

### Resurgence of Diphtheria

Diphtheria is an acute infectious disease caused by **[[Corynebacterium diphtheriae]]**. While it has largely disappeared from developed countries, it remains endemic in many developing nations, including India. Recently, there has been a **resurgence** and a shift in the epidemiological pattern of the disease.

#### Factors Contributing to Resurgence
The resurgence of diphtheria, particularly the shift in age distribution to older children and adults, is attributed to several epidemiological factors:

1.  **Gaps in Immunization Coverage:** Low coverage of infants and children allows a pool of susceptible individuals to accumulate. Epidemics in the former USSR were linked to relaxation in immunization practices.
2.  **Waning Immunity in Adults:** Immunity derived from childhood vaccination decreases over time. Unlike in the past, where frequent exposure to the bacteria (natural boosting) maintained immunity, improved hygiene has reduced this natural boosting.
3.  **Shift in Age Incidence:** There is a noticeable shift from pre-school children to older children and adults. This is often due to the lack of booster doses.
4.  **Migration:** Movement of large groups of people (migration/displacement) facilitates the spread of infection.
5.  **Reduced Natural Immunity:** Improved socio-economic conditions lead to fewer skin infections (cutaneous diphtheria), which previously helped maintain natural herd immunity.

> **Clinical Relevance:** A **[[Herd Immunity]]** of over 70% is required to prevent epidemic spread of diphtheria.

### Control of Diphtheria

Control measures must be targeted at the **[[Reservoir of Infection]]** (Cases and Carriers), interrupting transmission, and protecting the susceptible population.

#### 1. Management of Cases and Carriers

**A. Early Detection**
*   Active search for cases and carriers among family and school contacts.
*   Diagnosis confirmed by bacteriological culture (swabs from nose and throat).

**B. Isolation**
*   **Strict Isolation:** Cases and suspected cases must be isolated, preferably in a hospital.
*   **Duration:** Isolation should continue for at least **14 days** OR until **[[Two consecutive negative cultures]]** are obtained from nose and throat swabs taken 24 hours apart,.

**C. Treatment**
Treatment must not be delayed for laboratory confirmation.

| Modality | Agent | Dose/Duration | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Neutralization** | **[[Diphtheria Antitoxin]] (ADS)** | 20,000 – 100,000 Units (IM/IV) | Neutralize unbound toxin circulating in blood. **Crucial step.** |
| **Antibiotics** | **[[Penicillin]]** (Procaine) | 600,000 units IM daily x 10 days | Eliminate organism, stop toxin production, prevent carrier state. |
| **Alternative** | **[[Erythromycin]]** | 40 mg/kg/day x 10 days | For penicillin-allergic patients; highly effective for carriers. |

> *Note: Before giving Antitoxin, always perform a sensitivity test (conjunctival or intradermal) to rule out hypersensitivity to horse serum.*

**D. Management of Carriers**
*   Carriers are a major source of infection.
*   **Treatment:** 10-day course of oral **[[Erythromycin]]** is the drug of choice.

#### 2. Management of Contacts

Contacts are persons who have been in close association with a case. Management depends on their immunization status.

| Immunization Status of Contact | Action Required |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Primary immunization < 2 years ago** | No action required immediately. Monitor health. |
| **Primary immunization > 2-5 years ago** | Administer one **Booster dose** of Toxoid. |
| **Non-Immunized / Unknown Status** | 1. **Prophylactic Antibiotics:** Erythromycin or Penicillin x 7 days.<br>2. **Antitoxin:** 1000-2000 units (Prophylactic).<br>3. **Active Immunization:** Start primary vaccination immediately., |

**Surveillance of Contacts:**
*   Contacts should be medically examined **daily** for evidence of diphtheria for at least one week after exposure.
*   Throat swabs should be taken for bacteriological examination.

#### 3. Community Control (Immunization)

The only effective method for long-term control is **[[Active Immunization]]**.

*   **Vaccine:** Diphtheria Toxoid (usually as DPT, Pentavalent, or Td).
*   **National Immunization Schedule (India):**
    *   **Primary:** 3 doses at 6, 10, and 14 weeks (Pentavalent).
    *   **Boosters:** 16-24 months (DPT) and 5-6 years (DPT).
    *   **School Age:** Td (Tetanus + low dose diphtheria) at 10 and 16 years to maintain immunity in adolescents.
*   **Coverage Target:** Maintain high immunization coverage to ensure herd immunity and protect those who cannot be vaccinated.

### Mnemonic for Diphtheria Management: **"ABCD"**

*   **A** - **A**ntitoxin (Give immediately) / **A**irway (Watch for obstruction/tracheostomy)
*   **B** - **B**ull Neck (Clinical sign) / **B**ed rest (To prevent myocarditis)
*   **C** - **C**ulture (Diagnosis) / **C**ontact Tracing / **C**hemotherapy (Penicillin/Erythromycin)
*   **D** - **D**isinfection (Concurrent) / **D**PT Vaccine (Prevention)
