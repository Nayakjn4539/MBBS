# Ocular Signs in Diabetes Mellitus

**Diabetes Mellitus** is a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia that leads to microvascular and macrovascular complications. In the eye, it primarily manifests as **Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)**, a leading cause of blindness, but affects almost every structure of the eyeball.

## Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)
Diabetic retinopathy is a microangiopathy affecting the retinal precapillary arterioles, capillaries, and venules.

### 1. Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR)
Signs are confined to the retina and are a result of increased vascular permeability and capillary closure.

*   **[[Microaneurysms]]**:
    *   **Earliest clinically detectable sign** of DR,.
    *   **Pathology:** Focal dilatation of the capillary wall due to loss of [[pericytes]],.
    *   **Appearance:** Tiny, red dots usually located in the inner nuclear layer.
    *   **FFA:** Appear as hyperfluorescent dots,.
*   **[[Retinal Hemorrhage]]**:
    *   **Dot and Blot Hemorrhages:** Located in the deeper layers (inner nuclear and outer plexiform layers). Appear as round, dark red spots,.
    *   **Flame-shaped Hemorrhages:** Located in the superficial [[nerve fiber layer]]. Oriented parallel to nerve fibers,.
*   **[[Hard Exudates]]**:
    *   **Pathology:** Lipid deposits (lipoproteins) leaking from capillaries located in the outer plexiform layer,.
    *   **Appearance:** Yellowish-white, waxy looking patches with sharp/well-defined margins,.
    *   **Pattern:** Often arranged in clumps or a **circinate pattern** (ring) around leaking microaneurysms.
*   **[[Cotton Wool Spots]] (Soft Exudates)**:
    *   **Pathology:** Areas of ischemia/infarcts in the nerve fiber layer due to axoplasmic stasis,.
    *   **Appearance:** Fluffy, white, superficial lesions with ill-defined margins,.
    *   **Significance:** Indicates increasing retinal ischemia.
*   **Venous Changes**:
    *   Signs of ischemia include venous dilatation, [[venous beading]] (sausage-like segmentation), and looping,.
*   **[[IRMA]] (Intraretinal Microvascular Abnormalities)**:
    *   **Pathology:** Shunt vessels bypassing capillary bed occlusions.
    *   **Appearance:** Fine, irregular red lines connecting arterioles to venules. Unlike neovascularization, these do not cross major vessels and do not leak profusely on FFA.

### 2. Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR)
Characterized by the proliferation of new blood vessels (Neovascularization) induced by angiogenic factors like [[VEGF]] released by hypoxic retina.

*   **[[Neovascularization]]**:
    *   **NVD (Neovascularization of the Disc):** New vessels growing on the optic disc or within 1 disc diameter (DD) of it,.
    *   **NVE (Neovascularization Elsewhere):** New vessels growing anywhere on the retina further than 1 DD from the disc,.
    *   **Clinical Implication:** These vessels are fragile and lack pericytes, making them prone to rupture.
*   **Hemorrhage**:
    *   **Preretinal/Subhyaloid Hemorrhage:** Blood trapped between the retina and vitreous face. Often **boat-shaped**.
    *   **[[Vitreous Hemorrhage]]**: Diffuse blood in the vitreous gel causing sudden painless loss of vision,.
*   **Fibrovascular Proliferation**:
    *   Connective tissue grows along with new vessels. Contraction of this tissue leads to traction.
*   **[[Tractional Retinal Detachment]]**:
    *   Caused by the pull of fibrovascular membranes on the retina. The retina appears concave and immobile,.

### Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy Severity (ETDRS)

| Grade | Clinical Findings |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mild NPDR** | [[Microaneurysms]] only. |
| **Moderate NPDR** | More than mild, but less than severe (Microaneurysms, intraretinal hemorrhages, hard exudates). |
| **Severe NPDR** | Defined by the **4-2-1 Rule**,. One of the following:<br>1. Severe intraretinal hemorrhages in **4** quadrants.<br>2. Venous beading in **2** quadrants.<br>3. Moderate [[IRMA]] in **1** quadrant. |
| **Very Severe NPDR** | Two or more of the criteria for Severe NPDR. |
| **PDR** | Presence of [[Neovascularization]] or Vitreous/Preretinal hemorrhage. |

## Diabetic Maculopathy
Involvement of the macula is the most common cause of visual impairment in diabetic patients (especially Type 2),.

*   **Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)**: Retinal thickening due to fluid accumulation.
    *   **Cystoid Macular Edema ([[CME]]):** Fluid accumulation in outer plexiform and inner nuclear layers forming cyst-like spaces (Honey-comb appearance).
    *   **FFA:** Shows "flower-petal" appearance,.
*   **[[Ischemic Maculopathy]]**: Enlargement of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) due to capillary closure. Associated with profound visual loss.

### Clinically Significant Macular Edema (CSME)
Treatment is indicated if CSME is present. Diagnosis requires **one** of the following,:
1.  Retinal thickening at or within **500 microns** of the center of the fovea.
2.  [[Hard exudates]] at or within **500 microns** of the center of the fovea, *if* associated with adjacent retinal thickening.
3.  A zone of retinal thickening **1 disc area** or larger, any part of which is within **1 disc diameter** of the center of the fovea.

## Advanced Diabetic Eye Disease
The end result of uncontrolled PDR.
*   Persistent [[Vitreous Hemorrhage]].
*   Extensive Tractional [[Retinal Detachment]].
*   **[[Rubeosis Iridis]]**: Neovascularization of the iris, typically at the pupillary margin,.
*   **[[Neovascular Glaucoma]]**: Rubeosis extends to the anterior chamber angle, blocking outflow (secondary angle-closure glaucoma),.

## Other Ocular Signs in Diabetes (Non-Retinal)
Though the primary focus is retina, diabetes affects other structures:

### 1. Lens
*   **Senile Cataract:** Occurs at an earlier age and matures more rapidly in diabetics,.
*   **True Diabetic Cataract (Snowflake Cataract):**
    *   Occurs in young patients with Type 1 DM (uncontrolled).
    *   Appearance: Bilateral, subcapsular, white punctate opacities resembling **snowflakes**,.
    *   **Pathogenesis:** Osmotic overhydration due to sorbitol accumulation (Aldose Reductase pathway),.

### 2. Refraction
*   **Hypermetropic Shift:** Occurs in hypoglycemia.
*   **Myopic Shift:** Occurs in hyperglycemia due to lens swelling.

### 3. Neuro-ophthalmology
*   **Extraocular Muscle Palsy:** Diabetic neuropathy affecting CN III, IV, or VI.
    *   **CN III Palsy:** Characteristically **pupil-sparing** due to microangiopathy of the vasa nervorum (sparing superficial pupillary fibers),.
*   **Diabetic Papillopathy:** Swelling of the optic disc with telangiectatic vessels in young Type 1 diabetics.

### 4. Iris and Pupil
*   **Glycogen Laccination:** Glycogen deposits in pigment epithelium (Histological sign).
*   **Sluggish Pupil:** Due to autonomic neuropathy.
