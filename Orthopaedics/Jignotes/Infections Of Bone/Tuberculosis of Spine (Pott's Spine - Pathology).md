# Tuberculosis of Spine (Pott's Spine) - Pathology

**[[Tuberculosis of the spine]]**, also known as **[[Pott's disease]]** (named after Sir Percival Pott, 1779), is the most common form of skeletal tuberculosis, accounting for approximately 50% of all bone and joint TB cases. It is a chronic granulomatous inflammation caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.

### Etiopathogenesis

*   **Causative Organism:** *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (Human strain is most common; Bovine strain is rare).
*   **Nature of Infection:** It is **always secondary** to a primary focus elsewhere in the body (usually lungs or lymph nodes). The primary focus may be active or quiescent (latent).
*   **Route of Spread:**
    *   **Haematogenous (Blood-borne):** The most common route. Bacilli reach the vertebral body via arterial supply or the **[[Batson's paravertebral venous plexus]]**.
    *   **Batson's Plexus:** A system of valveless veins allowing retrograde flow from the pelvic and abdominal viscera to the vertebral column, explaining the high incidence in the dorsolumbar region.
    *   **Lymphatic spread:** Possible but less common.

### Regional Distribution

The infection has a predilection for the **dorsolumbar region (T10–L1)**.
*   **Dorsal (Thoracic):** ~42%
*   **Lumbar:** ~26%
*   **Dorsolumbar:** ~12%
*   **Cervical:** ~12%

### Pathological Classification of Vertebral Lesions

The pathology varies based on the initial site of lodgement of the bacilli within the vertebra.

| Type of Lesion | Frequency | Pathological Features | Clinical/Radiological Consequence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Paradiscal lesion]]** | **Most Common (95%)** | Infection starts in the metaphyseal region of the vertebral body adjacent to the [[intervertebral disc]]. | Arterial supply to the disc is cut off (end-arteritis) $\rightarrow$ disc nutrition fails $\rightarrow$ disc destruction. **Disc space narrowing** is the earliest radiological sign. |
| **[[Central lesion]]** | Less Common | Infection starts in the center of the vertebral body. | Leads to circumferential destruction and collapse of the vertebral body, resembling an accordion (**[[Concertina collapse]]**). Disc space is initially preserved. |
| **[[Anterior lesion]]** | Uncommon | Infection starts beneath the [[anterior longitudinal ligament]] (ALL). | Infection spreads up and down under the ligament, eroding the anterior surfaces of multiple vertebrae (**Aneurysmal phenomenon**). |
| **[[Posterior lesion]]** | Rare (5%) | Involves the posterior elements: pedicle, lamina, spinous process, or transverse process. | Can mimic a spinal tumor (**[[Spinal Tumor Syndrome]]**). Often missed on routine X-rays; requires oblique views or CT. |

### Pathogenesis and Progression

1.  **Initial Reaction:** The bacilli lodge in the bone marrow, inciting a chronic inflammatory reaction. Tuberculous follicles form (lymphocytes, giant cells, endothelial cells), leading to **[[caseation necrosis]]**.
2.  **Bone Destruction:** Hyperemia causes [[osteoporosis]] (rarefaction). The bony trabeculae are destroyed (osteolysis).
    *   *Thoracic Spine:* The normal kyphotic curve and anterior line of weight-bearing cause significant **anterior wedging** and collapse.
    *   *Cervical/Lumbar:* Due to lordosis, wedging is less severe, but telescoping may occur.
3.  **Disc Involvement:** Unlike pyogenic infection (which destroys the disc rapidly via proteolytic enzymes), TB destroys the disc slowly. The disc dies primarily due to the destruction of the **vertebral end-plates**, which cuts off its nutritional supply by diffusion.
4.  **Cold Abscess Formation:** The breakdown of caseous material forms a **[[cold abscess]]** (called "cold" because it lacks acute inflammatory signs like heat and redness). It consists of serum, WBCs, caseous material, bone debris, and bacilli.
5.  **Spread of Abscess:** The abscess accumulates under the anterior longitudinal ligament and tracks along fascial planes or neurovascular bundles (lines of least resistance).

### Fate of the Cold Abscess

The abscess tracks differently depending on the spinal level:

*   **Cervical Region:**
    *   **Retropharyngeal abscess:** Can cause dysphagia/respiratory distress.
    *   Tracks laterally to the posterior triangle of the neck.
    *   Tracks down into the mediastinum.
*   **Thoracic Region:**
    *   **Prevertebral/Paravertebral abscess:** Appears as a "Bird's nest" or fusiform shadow on X-ray.
    *   Can track along ribs (intercostal abscess).
*   **Lumbar Region:**
    *   **[[Psoas abscess]]:** Tracks within the psoas muscle sheath to the iliac fossa, groin (below inguinal ligament), or medial thigh.
    *   **Lumbar triangle of Petit:** May present as a swelling in the back.

### Spinal Deformity (Kyphosis)

Collapse of the anterior column of the spine leads to a posterior angulation known as **[[Kyphosis]]**. The type depends on the extent of destruction:

*   **Knuckle:** Collapse of **1** vertebral body (prominence of a single spinous process).
*   **Gibbus:** Collapse of **2 or 3** vertebral bodies (sharp angulation).
*   **Rounded Kyphosis:** Involvement of **multiple (>3)** vertebrae.

### Neurological Complications ([[Pott's Paraplegia]])

Neurological deficit occurs in approximately 20% of cases, most commonly in the thoracic spine (narrow canal).

**Causes of Compression (Pathology):**
1.  **Inflammatory (Early Onset):**
    *   Abscess/Pus accumulation (epidural).
    *   Granulation tissue.
    *   Caseous material.
    *   Inflammatory edema of the cord.
2.  **Mechanical (Late Onset):**
    *   **Sequestra:** Loose bone or disc fragments pushed into the canal.
    *   **[[Internal gibbus]]:** A bony ridge formed on the anterior wall of the canal due to severe kyphosis.
    *   Pathological dislocation.
    *   Fibrosis/Stenosis of the canal during healing.
3.  **Intrinsic:** Tuberculosis of the spinal cord (tuberculoma) or infective thrombosis of spinal arteries (anterior spinal artery syndrome).

### Healing Process

*   **Fibrous Ankylosis:** Tuberculosis of the spine typically heals by **fibrous ankylosis** (fibrous union between vertebrae).
*   **Bony Ankylosis:** Spontaneous bony fusion is less common in natural healing compared to pyogenic infections, but may occur with effective chemotherapy or surgical intervention.
*   **Reactivation:** Because healing is often fibrous, the infection can remain dormant and reactivate years later (Recrudescence).

### Clinical Implications

*   **Differentiation from Malignancy:** In TB spine, the **intervertebral disc space is reduced/destroyed** early. In metastatic disease/malignancy, the disc space is usually **preserved** (Winking Owl sign on X-ray indicates pedicle destruction in metastasis).
*   **Psoas Abscess:** A patient presenting with a flexion deformity of the hip and a lump in the iliac fossa should be examined for spinal TB.
*   **Paradiscal Lesion:** The most common pattern; localized back pain and stiffness are often the first symptoms before deformity appears.
