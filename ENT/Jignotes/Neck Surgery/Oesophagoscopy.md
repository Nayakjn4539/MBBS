# [[Oesophagoscopy]]

[[Oesophagoscopy]] is the direct visual examination of the [[esophagus]] using a rigid or flexible instrument. It is a critical procedure in otorhinolaryngology and gastroenterology for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

## Types of Oesophagoscopy

1.  **Rigid Oesophagoscopy:** Performed using a rigid metal tube. Ideally suited for removing sharp foreign bodies, obtaining large biopsies, and treating strictures.
2.  **Flexible Fibreoptic Oesophagoscopy:** Performed using a flexible scope. It is an outpatient procedure, comfortable for the patient, and allows visualization of the stomach and duodenum.
3.  **Transnasal Oesophagoscopy (TNO):** Performed through the nose using an ultrathin flexible endoscope. It is done under local anesthesia in an office setting,.

## Applied Anatomy for the Endoscopist

The [[esophagus]] is a muscular tube approximately 25 cm long in adults. It extends from the lower border of the [[cricoid cartilage]] (C6) to the cardiac orifice of the stomach (T11),.

### Physiological Constrictions
Knowledge of these constrictions is vital to prevent perforation and locate foreign bodies. Distances are measured from the upper incisor teeth,.

| Constriction Site | Vertebral Level | Distance from Incisors | Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cricopharyngeal sphincter** | C6 | 15 cm | Narrowest point; commonest site for Foreign Body (FB) impaction and iatrogenic perforation. |
| **Aortic Arch** crossing | T4 | 25 cm | Pulsations visible; care needed during biopsy. |
| **Left Main Bronchus** crossing | T5 | 27 cm | Just below the aortic constriction. |
| **Diaphragmatic Hiatus** | T10 | 40 cm | [[Lower Esophageal Sphincter]] (LES) region. |

*Mnemonic for Constrictions:* **C**ricoid, **A**orta, **B**ronchus, **D**iaphragm (**CABD** - 15, 25, 27, 40)

## Indications

### Diagnostic Indications
*   **[[Dysphagia]]:** To investigate malignancy, [[achalasia cardia]], strictures, or oesophagitis.
*   **Retrosternal Burning:** To assess [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD) or hiatus hernia.
*   **Haematemesis:** To identify [[esophageal varices]].
*   **Unknown Primary:** As part of **[[panendoscopy]]** to rule out synchronous primaries in patients with head and neck cancer,.
*   **Radiological Abnormalities:** To confirm findings from a barium swallow (e.g., filling defects).

### Therapeutic Indications
*   **Foreign Body Removal:** especially sharp or impacted objects (Rigid is preferred),.
*   **Dilatation:** Of esophageal strictures, webs (e.g., [[Plummer-Vinson syndrome]]), or achalasia.
*   **Sclerotherapy/Banding:** For esophageal varices.
*   **Stenting:** Insertion of palliative tubes (e.g., Souttar’s or Mousseau-Barbin tube) for advanced carcinoma.
*   **Biopsy:** Removal of benign lesions like polyps or fibromas.

## Contraindications

### Absolute
*   **Retropharyngeal Abscess:** Risk of rupture and aspiration.
*   **Aneurysm of Aorta:** Risk of fatal hemorrhage.
*   **Severe Trismus:** Makes insertion of rigid scope impossible (Flexible scope may be used).

### Relative
*   **Cervical Spine Disease:** Kyphosis, spondylosis, or osteophytes make rigid scopy difficult and risky.
*   **Advanced Systemic Disease:** Severe cardiac or respiratory decompensation.
*   **Corrosive Injury:** Acute phase (risk of perforation).

## Rigid Oesophagoscopy: Procedure

### Instruments
*   **[[Chevalier Jackson's oesophagoscope]]:** Has distal illumination.
*   **[[Negus oesophagoscope]]:** Has proximal illumination; larger lumen.
*   **Accessories:** Suction catheters, biopsy forceps, foreign body grasping forceps, and bougies,.

### Anesthesia and Position
*   **Anesthesia:** General Anesthesia (GA) with endotracheal intubation is preferred for rigid scopy to ensure relaxation.
*   **Position:** **"Barking Dog"** or **Boyce Position**.
    *   The patient lies supine.
    *   Head elevated 10–15 cm (flexion of the neck on the chest).
    *   Extension of the head at the atlanto-occipital joint.
    *   This aligns the axes of the mouth, pharynx, and esophagus,.

### Technique (Step-by-Step)
1.  **Preparation:** A tooth guard is placed to protect upper teeth. The scope is lubricated.
2.  **Introduction:** The scope is held like a pen in the right hand. The left hand retracts the lips and guides the scope.
3.  **Entry:** Introduce the scope through the right side of the mouth, navigating over the tongue.
4.  **Identifying Landmarks:**
    *   Identify the [[uvula]], then the [[epiglottis]].
    *   Advance past the epiglottis to see the [[arytenoids]] and the posterior pharyngeal wall.
5.  **Passing the Cricopharyngeus (The most critical step):**
    *   Keep the tip strictly midline behind the cricoid cartilage.
    *   Lift the scope anteriorly with the left thumb (do *not* use teeth as a fulcrum).
    *   Wait for the sphincter to relax (a lumen appears); gently advance. **Never use force**.
6.  **Thoracic Passage:** As the scope passes the thoracic inlet, the head is lowered slightly. The lumen must be kept in view at all times.
7.  **Passing the Cardia:** The head is lowered further and moved slightly to the right, aiming the scope toward the left anterior superior iliac spine.
8.  **Withdrawal:** The esophagus is inspected again carefully while withdrawing the scope.

**Clinical Implication:** Always identify the lumen before advancing. "Blind" pushing leads to perforation, most commonly at Killian's dehiscence.

## Flexible Fibreoptic Oesophagoscopy

*   **Setting:** Outpatient/Daycare procedure.
*   **Anesthesia:** Topical xylocaine spray ± intravenous sedation.
*   **Position:** Left lateral decubitus position.
*   **Technique:**
    *   A mouth gag/guard is placed.
    *   The scope is passed over the tongue into the pharynx.
    *   Patient is asked to swallow to facilitate entry into the esophagus.
    *   Air insufflation distends the lumen for visualization.
*   **Advantages:** Better for diagnosing mucosal lesions, assessing motility, and examining the stomach/duodenum. Can be done in patients with spinal deformities.

## Comparison: Rigid vs. Flexible Oesophagoscopy

| Feature | Rigid Oesophagoscopy | Flexible Oesophagoscopy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Anesthesia** | General Anesthesia | Topical / Local Sedation |
| **Admission** | Required | Outpatient / Daycare |
| **C-Spine/Jaw issues**| Difficult or Contraindicated | Can be performed |
| **Visual Field** | Esophagus only (usually) | Esophagus, Stomach, Duodenum |
| **Therapeutic Use** | **Best for FB removal** (esp. sharp/large), biopsy of tough lesions | Biopsy, small/soft FB removal, sclerotherapy |
| **Magnification** | Less (unless telescopes used) | High magnification & documentation |
| **Risk** | Higher risk of perforation | Lower risk, |

## Complications

### Immediate
1.  **Perforation:**
    *   **Most Common Site:** Posterior wall of hypopharynx (Killian's dehiscence) or just above the cricopharyngeal sphincter.
    *   **Signs:** Surgical emphysema, pain in the neck/interscapular region, tachycardia, fever.
2.  **Dental Injury:** Broken teeth or injury to lips/gums.
3.  **Hemorrhage:** From biopsy sites or varices.
4.  **Laryngeal Edema:** Causing respiratory distress, especially in children.
5.  **Arrhythmias:** Due to vagal stimulation.

### Late
1.  **Retropharyngeal Abscess / Mediastinitis:** Secondary to missed perforation.
2.  **Aspiration Pneumonia.**

## Post-Operative Care

1.  **NPO (Nil Per Os):** Keep patient NPO until the anesthetic effect wears off and gag reflex returns (usually 2-4 hours).
2.  **Monitoring:** Monitor vital signs (Pulse, BP, Temp). Tachycardia is often the first sign of mediastinitis/perforation.
3.  **Diet:** Start with sips of water, then soft diet if no complications arise.
4.  **Watch for Danger Signs:** Chest pain, fever, surgical emphysema in the neck, or difficulty breathing.
