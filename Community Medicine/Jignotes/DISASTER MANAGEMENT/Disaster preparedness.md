# [[DISASTER MANAGEMENT]] > Disaster preparedness

### **Disaster Preparedness**

**Definition**
[[Disaster preparedness]] refers to a programme of long-term development activities whose goals are to strengthen the overall capacity and capability of a country or community to manage efficiently all types of emergencies.
*   It brings about an orderly transition from relief through recovery, and back to sustained development.
*   It is not a one-time event but an **on-going multisectoral activity**.

**Objective**
The main objective is to ensure that appropriate systems, procedures, and resources are in place to provide prompt and effective assistance to [[disaster victims]], thus facilitating relief measures and rehabilitation of services.

### **Key Components of Disaster Preparedness**

To be effective, preparedness requires coordination across various sectors (Health, Police, Transport, Communication). The essential tasks include:

1.  **Risk Evaluation:** Evaluating the risk of the country or a particular region to disasters.
2.  **Standards and Regulations:** Adopting standards (e.g., building codes) and regulations to minimize impact.
3.  **Communication Systems:** Organizing communication, information, and **warning systems** (e.g., cyclone warnings).
4.  **Coordination:** Ensuring response mechanisms are coordinated between different agencies.
5.  **Resource Mobilization:** Adopting measures to ensure financial and other resources are available for increased readiness.
6.  **Public Education:** Developing programmes to educate the public on what to do during a disaster.
7.  **Media Coordination:** Coordinating information sessions with news media to prevent panic and spread accurate information.
8.  **Simulation Exercises:** Organizing **[[disaster simulation exercises]] (Mock Drills)** that test response mechanisms.

### **Community Preparedness**

The community members are the true "first responders." Preparedness at the community level is the cornerstone of any disaster management plan.

**Why Focus on Community Preparedness?**

| Reason | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Vulnerability** | Community members have the most to lose and the most to gain from effective preparation. |
| **First Response** | External aid may take days; neighbors rescue neighbors first. |
| **Local Resources** | Resources are most easily pooled at the community level. |
| **Sustainability** | Development is best achieved by allowing communities to design and manage their own internal assistance programs. |

### **Health Sector Preparedness**

The health sector must be ready to handle mass casualties. This involves:

*   **Hospital Disaster Plans:** Every hospital must have a contingency plan.
*   **[[Triage]] Training:** Training health workers to classify the injured based on severity (Red, Yellow, Green, Black) to assign priorities for treatment.
*   **Resource Stockpiling:** Ensuring adequate buffer stocks of medicines, IV fluids, and dressing materials.
*   **Epidemic Surveillance:** Setting up a reliable disease reporting system to identify outbreaks (e.g., gastroenteritis, leptospirosis) rapidly.
*   **Vaccination Planning:** While mass vaccination is usually not recommended immediately *during* a disaster, preparedness involves maintaining high routine immunization coverage (especially Measles and Tetanus) *before* the disaster strikes.

### **Preparedness for Chemical Disasters**

Unlike natural disasters, chemical disasters give little warning. Preparedness involves:
1.  **Hazard Identification:** Inventory of all hazardous chemicals in the area.
2.  **Risk Assessment:** Assessing the impact on the surrounding population and environment.
3.  **On-site and Off-site Plans:**
    *   **Alert System:** Effective communication network.
    *   **Antidotes:** Stockpiling specific antidotes.
    *   **Evacuation:** Plans for prompt evacuation of vulnerable groups.

### **Mnemonic for Disaster Preparedness**

**"P-R-E-P-A-R-E"**

*   **P**lan (Policy development and standard operating procedures)
*   **R**isk evaluation (Identifying hazards)
*   **E**xercises (Mock drills and simulation)
*   **P**ublic Awareness (Education and media coordination)
*   **A**lert systems (Warning signals)
*   **R**esources (Financial and material stockpiling)
*   **E**mergency coordination (Inter-sectoral cooperation)

---

### **Clinical Relevance**

*   **Triage Skills:** In a mass casualty setting, a doctor must suppress the instinct to treat the first patient seen. Instead, they must apply **[[Triage]]** principles (e.g., **START** - Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment) to do the greatest good for the greatest number.
*   **Disease Surveillance:** Post-disaster, physicians must be vigilant for water-borne diseases (Cholera, Typhoid) and vector-borne diseases (Malaria, Dengue) as ecological changes favor vector breeding.
*   **Psychological First Aid:** Preparedness includes training to handle the emotional stress and PTSD that follows disasters.
