# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > A case of dog bite has reported to your health centre. How will you categorize the dog bite injury? Describe the local treatment of the wound. Discuss the various available schedules of anti-rabies treatment.

### **Categorization of Dog Bite Injury**

The management of a dog bite depends entirely on the **risk assessment**. The World Health Organization (WHO) and National Guidelines classify exposures into three categories based on the nature of contact with the suspect animal [[Rabies Exposure Categories]].

| **Category** | **Type of Contact/Exposure** | **Risk Level** | **Recommended Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Category I** | • Touching or feeding animals.<br>• Licks on **intact skin**. | No Risk | • **None** (if history is reliable).<br>• Wash exposed skin surfaces. |
| **Category II** | • Nibbling of uncovered skin.<br>• Minor scratches or abrasions **without bleeding**. | Moderate Risk | • **Wound management.**<br>• **Anti-Rabies Vaccine (ARV)** immediately. |
| **Category III** | • Single or multiple **transdermal bites** or scratches.<br>• Licks on **broken skin**.<br>• Contamination of mucous membrane with saliva (e.g., licks on eyes/mouth).<br>• Exposure to **bats**.<br>• Bites from **wild animals** (jackal, fox). | Severe Risk | • **Wound management.**<br>• **Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG)**.<br>• **Anti-Rabies Vaccine (ARV)** immediately. |

***Clinical Relevance:** In India, the vaccination status of the biting animal (dog/cat) is **not** considered when deciding to initiate prophylaxis. If the animal was rabid, even a "pet" can transmit the virus. Always treat as a suspected rabid animal until proven otherwise.*

### **Local Treatment of the Wound**

Prompt local treatment is the **first line of defense** and can reduce the viral load at the site of inoculation by up to 80%.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Flowchart showing immediate wound wash steps: Tap water -> Soap application -> Alcohol application -> No suturing

1.  **Cleansing (Physical Method):**
    *   Immediately flush and wash the wound for a minimum of **15 minutes** with plenty of **soap and running water**.
    *   If soap is unavailable, flush with water alone.
    *   **Rationale:** The rabies virus envelope is lipid-based; soap breaks down this envelope, inactivating the virus.

2.  **Chemical Treatment:**
    *   After washing, apply a virucidal agent such as **70% alcohol**, **tincture iodine**, or **povidone-iodine**.

3.  **Suturing:**
    *   **Avoid suturing** immediately. Sutures can drive the virus deeper into tissues and nerves.
    *   If suturing is unavoidable (e.g., severe facial bleeding), it should be done **24–48 hours later**.
    *   If suturing must be done immediately for cosmetic reasons, **infiltrate [[Rabies Immunoglobulin]] (RIG)** around the wound *before* applying loose sutures.

4.  **Additional Measures:**
    *   Administer **Tetanus Toxoid (TT)** if the patient is not fully immunized.
    *   Prescribe antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial infection.

> **Mnemonic for Wound Care:** **W.A.S.H.**
> *   **W** - **Water** + Soap (15 mins)
> *   **A** - **Alcohol** or Antiseptic (Iodine)
> *   **S** - **Suturing** Avoided
> *   **H** - **Help** (Get to a hospital for Vaccine/RIG)

### **Schedules of Anti-Rabies Treatment (Vaccination)**

[[Anti-Rabies Vaccine]] (ARV) stimulates the body to produce antibodies. Modern **Cell Culture Vaccines (CCV)** like Human Diploid Cell Vaccine (HDCV) or Purified Chick Embryo Cell Vaccine (PCECV) are used.

#### **1. Intramuscular (IM) Regimens**
The vaccine is injected into the **deltoid muscle** (adults) or anterolateral thigh (infants/children). *Never* give in the gluteal region (buttocks) as fat absorption is poor.

*   **Essen Regimen (5-Dose Schedule):**
    *   The standard "gold standard" regimen.
    *   **Schedule:** Days **0, 3, 7, 14, and 28**.
    *   **Dose:** One full vial (0.5 ml or 1.0 ml depending on brand) per visit.

*   **Zagreb Regimen (Modified 4-Dose Schedule / 2-1-1):**
    *   Useful for inducing antibodies quickly.
    *   **Day 0:** 2 doses (one in each deltoid arm).
    *   **Day 7:** 1 dose.
    *   **Day 21:** 1 dose.
    *   Total: 4 doses in 3 visits.

> **Mnemonic for Essen:**
> "Telephone number **03-714-28**"
> (Day 0, 3, 7, 14, 28)

#### **2. Intradermal (ID) Regimen**
This is cost-effective as it uses a smaller volume (0.1 ml) but requires proper technique (raising a wheal).

*   **Updated Thai Red Cross Regimen (2-Site ID Schedule):**
    *   This is the regimen currently recommended in India under the National Rabies Control Program.
    *   **Dose:** 0.1 ml per site.
    *   **Sites:** Two sites (usually both deltoids).
    *   **Schedule:** Days **0, 3, 7, and 28** (The 2-2-2-0-2 schedule).
    *   **Note:** The visit on day 14 is skipped.

#### **3. Re-Exposure Prophylaxis (For Previously Immunized)**
If a person has a documented history of complete pre-exposure or post-exposure vaccination:
*   **Regimen:** Only **2 doses** are required.
*   **Schedule:** Day **0 and Day 3**.
*   **Route:** Can be IM or ID.
*   **RIG:** Not required for re-exposure cases.

### **Passive Immunization (For Category III)**
For Category III bites, the vaccine takes 7-14 days to produce antibodies. To cover this "gap period," ready-made antibodies are needed.

*   **[[Rabies Immunoglobulin]] (RIG):**
    *   **Human RIG (HRIG):** Dose **20 IU/kg**. Safer but expensive.
    *   **Equine RIG (ERIG):** Dose **40 IU/kg**. Must test for sensitivity first.
    *   **Administration:** Infiltrate **as much as possible** locally into and around the wound. Inject any remainder IM at a site distant from the vaccine (gluteal region).
