# [[Lower Limb]] > Femoral Shaft Fracture

# Femoral Shaft Fracture

### Definition and Anatomy
A [[Femoral Shaft Fracture]] is defined as a fracture of the diaphysis occurring from approximately 5 cm distal to the [[Lesser Trochanter]] to about 5 cm proximal to the [[Adductor Tubercle]].
*   **Structure:** The [[Femoral Shaft]] is a tubular cortical long bone. The narrowest part of the shaft is called the **isthmus**,.
*   **Vascularity:** It is highly vascular and surrounded by a thick, strong muscle cover (anterior, medial, and posterior compartments), which facilitates good healing but also contributes to significant hemorrhage.

### Mechanism of Injury
*   **Direct Injury:** Most common in young adults due to high-energy trauma (e.g., Road Traffic Accidents, fall from height, gunshot injuries). These are often associated with multiple systemic injuries,.
*   **Indirect Injury:** Caused by twisting or bending forces.
*   **Pathological Fracture:** Occurs with trivial trauma in bone weakened by metastasis, osteoporosis, or cysts.

### Deforming Forces and Displacement
The muscle attachments on the femur dictate the displacement of fracture fragments based on the level of the fracture.

| Fracture Level | Deforming Force/Muscle | Resulting Displacement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Proximal 1/3** | **Iliopsoas** (flexor)<br>**Gluteus Medius/Minimus** (abductor)<br>**External Rotators** | Proximal fragment is **Flexed, Abducted, and Externally Rotated**. |
| **Middle 1/3** | **Adductors** | **Shortening** and **Adduction**. |
| **Distal 1/3** | **Gastrocnemius** | Distal fragment is **Flexed** (tilted backwards),. |

### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:** Severe pain, swelling, and inability to move the limb.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Deformity:** The limb is often shortened and lies in complete [[External Rotation]] (lateral border of the foot touches the bed).
    *   **Swelling:** Tense, swollen thigh due to hematoma.
    *   **Shock:** [[Hypovolemic Shock]] is common as these fractures are associated with blood loss of up to **1000–1500 ml**,.
    *   **Neurovascular Status:** Must be assessed to rule out injury to the [[Femoral Artery]] or [[Sciatic Nerve]].

### Classification
**Winquist and Hansen Classification** is commonly used, based on the degree of comminution. Fractures are also described based on the pattern:
*   Transverse
*   Oblique
*   Spiral
*   Comminuted
*   Segmental.

### Imaging
*   **X-ray:** Anteroposterior (AP) and Lateral views of the entire femur.
*   **Rule of Two Joints:** Must include the **hip** and **knee** joints to rule out associated injuries like [[Hip Dislocation]], [[Femoral Neck Fracture]], or [[Tibial Plateau Fracture]],,.

### Management

#### 1. Emergency Management (ATLS Protocol)
*   **Resuscitation:** IV fluids and blood products to manage shock/blood loss.
*   **Splinting:** Application of a [[Thomas Splint]] to decrease pain, realign the fracture, and reduce bleeding.

#### 2. Definitive Management in Adults
Operative management is the standard of care for adults to allow early mobilization.

*   **Intramedullary Nailing (Treatment of Choice):**
    *   **Interlocking Nail:** The **Gold Standard**. It controls rotation and length, providing stability even in comminuted or segmental fractures,.
    *   **Kuntscher Nail (K-Nail):** A cloverleaf-shaped hollow nail used for fractures at the isthmus. It relies on 3-point fixation but provides poor rotational stability compared to interlocking nails,.
*   **Plating ([[Dynamic Compression Plate]]):** Indicated for distal/proximal fractures where nails are less effective, or if there is an associated vascular injury requiring repair. It is less preferred for diaphyseal fractures due to the need for extensive exposure,.
*   **External Fixation:**
    *   **Indications:** Severe [[Open Fracture]] (Type III), damage control orthopaedics in polytrauma (unstable patients), or bone loss requiring bone transport,.

#### 3. Definitive Management in Children
Treatment varies significantly by age.

| Age Group | Treatment Modality |
| :--- | :--- |
| **< 6 Months** | [[Pavlik Harness]]. |
| **6 Months – 5 Years** | [[Hip Spica Cast]]. (Note: **Gallows Traction** is used for <2 years or <12 kg,). |
| **5 – 10 Years** | [[Flexible Intramedullary Nail]] (e.g., **TENS** - Titanium Elastic Nail System, Ender’s Nail). |
| **> 10 Years** | [[Intramedullary Interlocking Nail]]. |

### Complications

#### Early Complications
1.  **Hemorrhagic Shock:** Significant blood loss (1.0–1.5 L).
2.  **[[Fat Embolism Syndrome]] (FES):**
    *   Occurs 24-48 hours post-injury due to intramedullary fat leaking into circulation.
    *   **Clinical Features:** Respiratory distress (tachypnea, dyspnea), Cerebral involvement (confusion, drowsiness), Petechial rash (chest/axilla),.
    *   **Diagnosis:** **Gurd’s Criteria** (Requires 1 Major + 4 Minor).
        *   *Major:* Respiratory insufficiency ($PaO_2 < 60 mmHg$), CNS depression, Petechial rash.
        *   *Minor:* Tachycardia, Pyrexia, Retinal emboli, Fat in urine/sputum, Thrombocytopenia, Anemia.
3.  **Vascular Injury:** Injury to the [[Femoral Artery]] is rare but dangerous; common in distal third fractures,.
4.  **Nerve Injury:** [[Sciatic Nerve]] injury (neuropraxia to complete severance).

#### Late Complications
1.  **Malunion:** Healing in an abnormal position (shortening, angulation, or rotation).
2.  **Non-union:** Rare due to rich blood supply and muscle cover.
3.  **Knee Stiffness:** Due to quadriceps fibrosis or adhesions from prolonged immobilization.

### Special Consideration: Ipsilateral Femoral Neck and Shaft Fracture
*   **Incidence:** Rare (approx. 2.5%), often due to high-velocity trauma.
*   **Diagnostic Trap:** The [[Femoral Neck Fracture]] is missed in **20–30%** of cases because attention is focused on the obvious shaft fracture.
*   **Management:** Priority is to fix the **Neck Fracture** first (to prevent [[Avascular Necrosis]]).
*   **Fixation Options:** Cannulated cancellous screws for the neck + Retrograde nailing/plate for the shaft, OR a **Reconstruction Nail** (cephalomedullary nail) for both,.
