# [[Upper Limb]] > Distal Radius Fracture

### Distal Radius Fracture (Colles' Fracture)

[[Colles' fracture]] is the most common fracture of the [[distal radius]], typically seen in elderly osteoporotic individuals. It is defined as a fracture of the distal end of the [[radius]] at the cortico-cancellous junction (approximately **1.5 inches or 2.5 cm** proximal to the articular surface) with **dorsal displacement** of the distal fragment.

### Epidemiology and Mechanism of Injury
*   **Demographics:** Most common in elderly post-menopausal females due to [[osteoporosis]]. It is the most common fracture in women over 40 years.
*   **Mechanism:** Fall on an outstretched hand (**FOOSH**) with the wrist in dorsiflexion (extension).
*   **Anatomy:** The fracture occurs at the point of weakness where the dense cortical bone of the shaft meets the cancellous bone of the metaphysis.

### Pathoanatomy: The 6 Displacements
The deformity in Colles' fracture is classic. The distal fragment undergoes specific displacements relative to the proximal shaft.

**Table: The 6 Displacements of Colles' Fracture**

| Type of Displacement | Direction/Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Impaction** | The distal fragment is impacted into the proximal fragment (causes radial shortening). |
| **Lateral Displacement** | The distal fragment shifts radially (Lateral shift). |
| **Lateral Tilt** | The distal articular surface tilts radially (Lateral angulation). |
| **Dorsal Displacement** | The distal fragment shifts backward (Dorsal shift). |
| **Dorsal Tilt** | The distal articular surface faces dorsally (Dorsal angulation/Loss of normal volar tilt). |
| **Supination** | The distal fragment rotates into supination. |

**Mnemonic for Displacements: ID LS DS**
*   **I**mpaction
*   **D**orsal displacement
*   **L**ateral displacement
*   **S**upination
*   **D**orsal tilt
*   **S**upination

### Clinical Features
*   **Pain and Swelling:** Localized to the wrist.
*   **Tenderness:** Over the distal radius.
*   **Deformity:** The classic **[[Dinner Fork Deformity]]** (or Bayonet deformity). This is caused by the dorsal displacement and dorsal tilt of the distal fragment, combined with proximal migration.
*   **Radial Styloid Position:** Normally, the [[radial styloid]] is about 1 cm distal to the [[ulnar styloid]]. In Colles' fracture, the radial styloid migrates proximally and may come to lie at the same level or higher than the ulnar styloid.

### Diagnostic Imaging
*   **X-Ray Wrist (AP and Lateral views):** Essential for diagnosis.
    *   **AP View:** Shows comminution, radial shortening, and radial deviation.
    *   **Lateral View:** Shows dorsal tilt of the articular surface (normally volar tilted) and dorsal displacement.
    *   **Associated Injury:** Look for fracture of the [[ulnar styloid process]], which is very common.

### Classification: Frykman's Classification
This system is based on the involvement of the radiocarpal and distal radioulnar joints, and the presence of an ulnar styloid fracture.

| Type | Description | Ulnar Styloid Fracture? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type I** | Extra-articular | Absent |
| **Type II** | Extra-articular | **Present** |
| **Type III** | Intra-articular (Radiocarpal joint) | Absent |
| **Type IV** | Intra-articular (Radiocarpal joint) | **Present** |
| **Type V** | Intra-articular (Distal Radioulnar joint) | Absent |
| **Type VI** | Intra-articular (Distal Radioulnar joint) | **Present** |
| **Type VII** | Intra-articular (Both joints) | Absent |
| **Type VIII** | Intra-articular (Both joints) | **Present** |

*Note: Even numbers (II, IV, VI, VIII) always indicate the presence of an ulnar styloid fracture.*

### Management

**1. Conservative Management (Closed Reduction)**
Indicated for undisplaced fractures or displaced fractures that are reducible and stable.
*   **Technique:** Performed under local or general anesthesia.
    1.  **Disimpaction:** Longitudinal traction is applied (Hand-shaking method) to disimpact fragments.
    2.  **Reduction:** The surgeon presses the distal fragment into **palmar flexion** and **ulnar deviation** while maintaining traction.
    3.  **Immobilization:** Application of a **[[Colles' Cast]]** (Below-elbow cast).
*   **Cast Position:** The wrist is immobilized in **Palmar flexion** and **Ulnar deviation** with slight pronation. This utilizes the intact dorsal periosteal hinge to maintain reduction.
*   **Duration:** The cast is usually retained for **6 weeks**. Check X-rays are taken weekly for the first 3 weeks to detect redisplacement.

**2. Operative Management**
Indicated for unstable fractures, comminuted fractures, intra-articular involvement, or failure of closed reduction.
*   **Percutaneous K-Wire Fixation:** Used for unstable fractures to hold fragments in place, often supplemented with a cast (Kapandji technique).
*   **External Fixation:** Useful for highly comminuted fractures or open fractures. It uses **ligamentotaxis** to maintain length and alignment.
*   **Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF):** Using Volar locking plates (**LCP**). This allows for anatomical reduction and early mobilization. This is increasingly becoming the standard for unstable distal radius fractures.

### Complications

**Early Complications**
*   **Median Nerve Compression:** Acute [[Carpal Tunnel Syndrome]] due to pressure from the displaced fragment or hematoma.
*   **Compartment Syndrome:** Rare in forearm/hand but possible with tight casts.
*   **Finger Stiffness:** Due to edema or improper cast technique (cast extending beyond metacarpal heads).

**Late Complications**
*   **Malunion:** The most common complication. results in the persistence of the **Dinner Fork Deformity**. While cosmetically unappealing, it is often functionally acceptable in the elderly. In young adults, corrective [[osteotomy]] may be required.
*   **Sudeck’s Osteodystrophy ([[Complex Regional Pain Syndrome]] Type 1):** Characterized by pain, swelling, stiffness, and shiny skin. The hand becomes stiff and painful (Shoulder-Hand Syndrome). Prevention involves early mobilization of fingers.
*   **Rupture of Extensor Pollicis Longus (EPL) Tendon:** Occurs weeks or months later due to attrition of the tendon over the sharp fracture ridge or vascular compromise. It is treated by tendon transfer (usually [[Extensor Indicis]]).
*   **Stiffness of Shoulder:** Due to neglect of shoulder movements during cast immobilization.
*   **Non-union:** Extremely rare in Colles' fracture due to the cancellous nature of the bone.
