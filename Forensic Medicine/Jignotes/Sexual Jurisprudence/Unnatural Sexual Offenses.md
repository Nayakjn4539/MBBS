# [[Sexual Jurisprudence]] > Unnatural Sexual Offenses

### Definition
Unnatural sexual offenses consist of sexual practices that are considered **"against the order of nature"** or deviate from the biological aim of sexual intercourse (procreation).

### Legal Status in India
*   **[[Section 377 IPC]]**: Historically defined unnatural offenses. It stated: "Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine."
    *   **Explanation:** Penetration is sufficient to constitute the carnal intercourse necessary to the offense described in this section.
*   **Current Legal Status**:
    *   **Consensual acts:** Sexual acts between consenting adults in private are **decriminalized** (Supreme Court Judgment 2018).
    *   **Non-consensual acts / Acts with Minors / Bestiality:** These remain punishable offenses.
    *   **[[Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita]] (BNS):** The new code (BNS) does not have a direct equivalent to Section 377 IPC, effectively removing "unnatural offenses" as a distinct category, though non-consensual acts are covered under sexual assault/rape provisions (Section 63 BNS).

### Classification of Unnatural Sexual Offenses
1.  **[[Sodomy]]** (Anal intercourse)
2.  **Buccal Coitus** (Oral sex)
3.  **Tribadism** (Lesbianism)
4.  **Bestiality** (Zoophilia)

### 1. Sodomy (Buggery)
*   **Definition:** Sexual intercourse per anum between two males or a male and a female.
*   **Active Agent:** The person introducing the penis (Sodomist).
*   **Passive Agent:** The person into whose anus the penis is introduced. If a young boy, he is referred to as a **[[Catamite]]**.

#### Examination of the Victim (Passive Agent)
The findings depend heavily on whether the victim is accustomed to the act (habitual) or if it is a recent/first-time occurrence.

**A. Findings in Acute / Non-Habitual Case**
*   **Physical:**
    *   Walking with legs wide apart (due to pain).
    *   Tenderness and pain in the anal region.
*   **Local Examination:**
    *   **Spasm:** The anal sphincter is tightly contracted/spasmed.
    *   **Injury:** Abrasions of the anal mucosa, bruising, or radial fissures.
    *   **Triangular Lacerations:** In acute forceful penetration, triangular lacerations may be seen at the anal verge.
    *   **Fluids:** Presence of blood, lubricant, or [[Semen]] (collect swabs).
    *   **Swabs:** Anal swabs and peri-anal swabs must be taken for acid phosphatase and spermatozoa detection.

**B. Findings in Habitual Passive Agent (Chronic Sodomite)**
*   **Anal Sphincter:** Relaxed and lacks tone (Patulous anus).
*   **Funnel Shape:** The anus appears funnel-shaped (depression of buttocks towards the anus).
*   **Mucosa:** The rugosities (folds) of the anal mucosa are smoothened out or obliterated ("Ironing out" of folds).
*   **Skin:** Perianal skin may be thickened and smooth (cornified).
*   **Anal Reflex:** When the buttocks are separated or the anal skin is touched, the anal sphincter **dilates** instead of contracting (paradoxical reaction).
*   **Pathology:** Presence of old scars, fissures, piles (hemorrhoids), or incontinence of feces/gas.
*   **Infections:** Evidence of STDs like Gonorrhea (rectal), Syphilis (chancre), or HIV.

**Table: Differences between Non-Habitual and Habitual Passive Agents**

| Feature | Non-Habitual (Acute) | Habitual (Chronic) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sphincter Tone** | Tight, spastic | Relaxed, patulous |
| **Shape of Anus** | Normal | **[[Funnel shaped anus]]** |
| **Mucosal Folds** | Present (Rugose) | Obliterated (Smooth) |
| **Anal Reflex** | Constricts | **Dilates** (Paradoxical) |
| **Injuries** | Recent tears, blood, inflammation | Old scars, piles, fissures |
| **Pain** | Severe | Minimal or absent |

#### Examination of the Accused (Active Agent)
*   **Evidence of lubricant:** Oil, grease, or vaseline on the penis.
*   **Smegma:** Likely absent (rubbed off during the act).
*   **Fecal Matter:** Traces of fecal matter under fingernails or on the penis (coronal sulcus).
*   **Odour:** Typical fecal odour on the penis/body.
*   **Infections:** Urethritis or syphilitic chancre.
*   **DNA:** Vaginal/Anal epithelial cells of the victim found on penile swabs.

### 2. Buccal Coitus (Oral Sex)
*   **Definition:** Sexual congress by the mouth.
    *   **Sin of Gomorrah:** A term often used historically for oral sex.
    *   **Fellatio:** Penis into mouth.
    *   **Cunnilingus:** Mouth to vagina.
    *   **Anilingus:** Mouth to anus.
*   **Medicolegal Findings:**
    *   Usually, **no characteristic physical signs** are found.
    *   In children or forcible cases, there may be:
        *   Bruising/petechiae on the soft palate or throat.
        *   Tears in the frenulum of the tongue or lips.
        *   Stiff neck or jaw pain (trismus).
    *   **Confirmatory Evidence:** Presence of [[Spermatozoa]] or Acid Phosphatase in saliva/mouth washings.
    *   Transmission of STDs (Gonococcal pharyngitis, Syphilis) to the oral cavity.

### 3. Tribadism (Lesbianism)
*   **Definition:** Sexual gratification between two females.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   Mutual friction of genitals (Tribadism).
    *   Oral stimulation (Cunnilingus).
    *   Use of artificial phallus (Dildo) or fingers.
*   **Medicolegal Findings:**
    *   Usually **nil** in true tribadism (external friction).
    *   If an artificial phallus is used, findings may mimic vaginal intercourse (hymenal tears, abrasions, dilation of the vaginal orifice).
    *   **Legal:** Not punishable in India if between consenting adults (Sec 377 mentions "any woman," but practically consensual acts are decriminalized).

### 4. Bestiality (Zoophilia)
*   **Definition:** Sexual intercourse by a human being with a lower animal.
*   **Common Animals:** Cows, mares, goats, dogs.
*   **Medicolegal Aspects:**
    *   Punishable under **[[Section 377 IPC]]** (life imprisonment or up to 10 years).
*   **Examination of the Accused:**
    *   Animal hair on clothes or body.
    *   Injuries caused by the animal (kicks, bites, scratches, claw marks).
    *   Smell of animal excreta or urine.
    *   Presence of animal vaginal cells/feces on the penis.
*   **Examination of the Animal:**
    *   Swabs from the animal's vagina/anus for human **[[Spermatozoa]]**.
    *   Injuries to the animal's genitalia (due to size disproportion).

### Medicolegal Aspects & Autopsy Findings

**Medicolegal Aspects:**
*   **Consent:** Under the new legal framework (post-2018), consent is the primary differentiating factor for adults. Acts with animals are *always* offences as animals cannot consent.
*   **Collection of Evidence:**
    *   **Active Agent:** Penile swabs, nail scrapings, hair combing.
    *   **Passive Agent:** Anal swabs (dry and wet), rectal washings, clothing.
    *   **Chain of Custody:** Essential for all samples sent to the laboratory.

**Autopsy Findings (In cases of Homicide + Unnatural Sex):**
*   **Reflex Anal Dilatation:** Can be a post-mortem artifact, so interpret with caution.
*   **Sperm Detection:** Oral/Anal/Rectal swabs can remain positive for sperm for varying durations (Anal: up to 24-48 hours; Oral: usually lost rapidly due to swallowing/enzymes).
*   **Violence:** Look for associated injuries of throttling or blunt force trauma used to subdue the victim.
