# [[Environment And Health]] > Water Purification on Small Scale

Three methods are generally available for purifying water on a small scale or domestic scale: **Boiling**, **Chemical Disinfection**, and **Filtration**.

### 1. Boiling
This is a satisfactory method for household purification.
*   **Procedure:** Water must be brought to a **"rolling boil"** for **5 to 10 minutes** (some sources say 10-20 minutes).
*   **Mechanism:** It kills all bacteria, spores, cysts, and ova. It yields sterilized water.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Simple and effective.
    *   Removes [[Temporary Hardness]] by driving off carbon dioxide and precipitating calcium carbonate.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   **No residual protection:** There is no "residual effect" against subsequent contamination during storage.
    *   **Taste:** Water becomes insipid (tasteless) due to loss of dissolved gases.
    *   *Remedy:* Shake the water vigorously to re-aerate it and restore taste.
    *   Water should be stored in the same container in which it is boiled to prevent cross-contamination.

### 2. Chemical Disinfection
#### A. Bleaching Powder (Chlorinated Lime - CaOCl2)
*   **Properties:** White amorphous powder with a pungent chlorine smell. Fresh powder contains **33% available chlorine**. It is unstable and loses chlorine on exposure to light/air/moisture.
*   **Stabilized Bleach:** Mixed with lime (4:1 ratio) to retain strength.
*   **Dosage:** Roughly **2.5 grams** of good quality bleaching powder disinfects **1,000 liters** of water.
*   **Principle:** Ensure a **"Free" Residual Chlorine** of **0.5 mg/liter** after a contact period of **1 hour**.
*   **Stock Solution:** A 5% chlorine solution can be prepared by mixing 4 kg of bleaching powder (25% available chlorine) in 20 liters of water.

#### B. Chlorine Tablets
Useful for small quantities (camps, travel, household).
*   **[[Halazone Tablets]]:** 1 tablet disinfects 1 liter of water.
*   **NEERI Formulation:** Developed by National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, Nagpur. 1 tablet (0.5g) disinfects **20 liters** of water. 15 times better than ordinary halogen tablets.

#### C. Iodine
*   Used for emergency disinfection.
*   **Dosage:** 2 drops of **2% ethanol solution of iodine** per liter of clear water.
*   **Contact time:** 20 to 30 minutes.
*   **Disadvantages:** High cost and physiological activity (thyroid activity).

#### D. Potassium Permanganate (KMnO4)
*   **Current Status:** **Not recommended**.
*   **Drawbacks:** Powerful oxidizing agent but a weak disinfectant. It alters color, smell, and taste.
*   **Note:** It may kill *Vibrio cholerae* but is useless against other organisms.

### 3. Filtration (Ceramic Filters)
Water passes through micropores of a "candle".
*   **Pasteur Chamberland Filter:** Candle made of **Porcelain**.
*   **Berkefeld Filter:** Candle made of **Kieselguhr** (infusorial earth).
*   **[[Katadyn Filter]]:** Surface coated with a **Silver Catalyst**.
    *   **Mechanism:** Kills bacteria by the **[[Oligodynamic action]]** of silver ions.
*   **Maintenance:** Candles get clogged and must be scrubbed with a hard brush and boiled at least once a week.
*   **Limitation:** Removes bacteria but **not viruses**.

### 4. Disinfection of Wells
Wells are the main source of water in rural India. Disinfection is crucial during epidemics (e.g., Cholera).
**Agent:** Bleaching powder is the agent of choice.

**Steps of Well Disinfection:**
1.  **Find the Volume:** Measure depth (h) and diameter (d).
    *   Formula: Volume (Liters) = $3.14 \times d^2 \times h \times 1000 / 4$.
2.  **Find Chlorine Demand:** Use [[Horrock's Apparatus]] to estimate the amount of bleaching powder required.
3.  **Dissolve:** Make a thin paste of the required bleaching powder and dissolve in water. Sediment the lime and use the supernatant chlorine solution.
4.  **Delivery:** Lower the bucket containing the solution into the well and agitate violently.
5.  **Contact Period:** Allow **1 hour** contact time before use.
6.  **Test:** Check for residual chlorine using the **[[Orthotolidine Arsenite Test]]**. If free residual chlorine is < 0.5 mg/L, repeat the process.

**[[Double Pot Method]]**
*   Used during **emergencies** to ensure constant chlorination for 2-3 weeks.
*   **Structure:** Two cylindrical pots (one inside other). Inner pot contains a mixture of **1 kg Bleaching Powder + 2 kg Coarse Sand**.
*   The unit is lowered into the well 1 meter below water level.

### 5. Other Methods
*   **[[Ultraviolet Irradiation]]:** Mercury vapor arc lamps (254 nm). Efficient but needs electricity and water free of turbidity. No residual effect.
*   **Reverse Osmosis (RO):** Removes dissolved solids, hardness, heavy metals, and microbes.

### Clinical Relevance: Water-Borne Diseases
*   **Viral:** Hepatitis A, Hepatitis E, Poliomyelitis, Rotavirus.
*   **Bacterial:** Cholera, Typhoid, Bacillary Dysentery.
*   **Protozoal:** Amoebiasis, Giardiasis.
*   **Helminthic:** Roundworm, Hydatid disease.
*   **Cyclops:** Guinea worm (Dracunculiasis).

### Mnemonic
**"B-C-F"** for small scale purification:
*   **B**oiling
*   **C**hemicals (Bleaching powder, Chlorine tabs, Iodine)
*   **F**iltration (Ceramic filters)

**"H-O-C"** for Chlorine Tests:
*   **H**orrock's Apparatus $\rightarrow$ Chlorine **Demand**
*   **O**rthotolidine Test $\rightarrow$ **Free** & Combined Chlorine (Residual)
*   **C**hloroscope $\rightarrow$ Measures Residual Chlorine level
