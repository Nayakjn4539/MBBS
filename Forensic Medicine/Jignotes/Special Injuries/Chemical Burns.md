# [[Special Injuries]] > Chemical Burns

### Chemical Burns

Chemical burns (also known as [[corrosive burns]]) result from the destruction of tissues by chemical agents. Unlike thermal burns, the tissue destruction continues as long as the chemical remains in contact with the skin or mucosa.

### Classification of Caustic Agents

1.  **Inorganic Acids:** [[Sulphuric acid]] ($H_2SO_4$), Nitric acid ($HNO_3$), Hydrochloric acid ($HCl$), Hydrofluoric acid ($HF$).
2.  **Organic Acids:** [[Carbolic acid]] (Phenol), Oxalic acid, Acetic acid.
3.  **Alkalis:** Caustic potash ($KOH$), Caustic soda ($NaOH$), Ammonium hydroxide.
4.  **Metallic Salts:** Zinc chloride, Silver nitrate.

### Pathophysiology: Mechanism of Action

The severity depends on the **concentration**, **quantity**, and **duration of contact**.

| Agent Type | Mechanism | Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Acids** | **[[Coagulative Necrosis]]** | Precipitate proteins to form a hard, dry protective scab (**eschar**) which limits deep tissue penetration. <br> *Exception:* [[Hydrofluoric acid]] causes liquefactive necrosis. |
| **Alkalis** | **[[Liquefactive Necrosis]]** | Saponification of fats and solubilization of proteins. No protective eschar forms, allowing **deep penetration** into tissues. <br> *Note: Alkalis generally cause more severe damage than acids.* |

### Clinical Features

**1. Local Effects:**
*   **Pain:** Burning pain (intense). *Exception:* [[Carbolic acid]] causes local anesthesia, so the burn may be painless.
*   **Discoloration:** Specific to the agent (see table below).
*   **Vesication:** Blister formation is rare with strong acids but common with dilute acids and plants.
*   **Inflammation:** Redness and swelling around the corroded area.

**2. Systemic Effects:**
*   **Shock:** Primary (neurogenic due to pain) or Secondary (hypovolemic due to fluid loss).
*   **Respiratory:** Inhalation of fumes (esp. Ammonia, Nitric acid) causes laryngeal edema, spasm, or pulmonary edema.
*   **Toxemia:** Absorption of poison (e.g., Phenol, Oxalic acid) leading to renal/hepatic failure.

#### Diagnostic Staining of Tissues (Exam High Yield)

| Agent | Colour of Stain/Eschar | Mechanism/Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sulphuric Acid** | **Black / Brown** | Due to charring (dehydration) of tissues; resembles simple heat burns. |
| **Nitric Acid** | **Yellow** | Due to **[[Xanthoproteic reaction]]**. |
| **Hydrochloric Acid** | **Greyish-White** | Later turns brown/black due to blood. |
| **Carbolic Acid** | **Bleached White / Grey** | Leathery texture; tough and corrugated skin. |
| **Alkalis** | **Greyish-White** | Soggy, slimy, soapy, and soft texture. |
| **Copper Sulphate** | **Blue** | Used as an antiseptic/fungicide. |

### Management

**Immediate First Aid (The Golden Rule):**
*   **Copious Irrigation:** Wash the affected area with large amounts of running water for at least **15–20 minutes** or until the pH of the surface returns to neutral.
*   **Remove Contaminants:** Immediately remove contaminated clothing and jewelry.
*   **Do NOT Neutralize:** DO NOT use weak acids (vinegar) on alkali burns or weak alkalis (baking soda) on acid burns.
    *   *Reason:* The neutralization reaction is **exothermic** (releases heat), causing thermal damage on top of chemical damage.

**Specific Management:**
1.  **Ocular Burns:** Irrigation is the absolute priority. Wash with water/saline for 30 mins. Consult ophthalmology.
2.  **[[Hydrofluoric Acid]] Burns:**
    *   Penetrates deep to bone; causes severe hypocalcemia.
    *   **Antidote:** 2.5% **Calcium Gluconate** gel applied topically or injected intradermally/intra-arterially.
3.  **[[Carbolic Acid]] (Phenol):**
    *   Not water-soluble (can form a thin film).
    *   Wash with **Polyethylene Glycol (PEG)** or **Methylated Spirit/Alcohol** (swab), followed by water.
4.  **Phosphorus Burns:**
    *   Keep the area wet (water/saline) to prevent spontaneous ignition in air.
    *   Wash with **1% Copper Sulphate** (forms black copper phosphide coating, making particles visible for removal).

**General Treatment:**
*   Analgesics (Morphine) for pain.
*   Fluid resuscitation (Parkland formula application).
*   Tetanus prophylaxis.
*   Antibiotics to prevent secondary infection.

### Medicolegal Aspects

**1. [[Vitriolage]] (Acid Throwing):**
*   The act of throwing corrosive fluid (commonly Sulphuric acid—"Oil of Vitriol") on the face or body of another person.
*   **Motive:** Usually jealousy, revenge, or refusal of marriage/relationship proposals.
*   **Result:** Permanent disfiguration, blindness (grievous hurt), physical deformity, and psychological trauma.
*   **Legal Section (India - IPC):**
    *   **Section 326A IPC:** Voluntarily causing grievous hurt by use of acid. Punishment: Minimum 10 years to Life Imprisonment + Fine (paid to victim).
    *   **Section 326B IPC:** Voluntarily throwing or attempting to throw acid. Punishment: 5 to 7 years + Fine.

**2. Nature of Event:**
*   **Suicidal:** Common (ingestion).
*   **Accidental:** Occupational hazards (labs, industry).
*   **Homicidal:** Rare (difficult to force feed corrosives), except in children or incapacitated adults.

### Autopsy Findings

**External:**
*   **Corrosion stains:** Present on lips, chin, neck, chest, and hands.
*   **[[Trickle marks]]:** Linear streaks of corrosion running down from the angles of the mouth to the chin and neck (indicates liquid flowed down due to gravity).
*   **Clothing:** Stains, holes, or destruction of fabric. (Preserve clothes for chemical analysis).

**Internal (if ingested):**
*   **Mucosa:** Corroded, desquamated, or charred (depending on agent).
*   **Stomach:**
    *   *Sulphuric acid:* Stomach wall blackened, soft, friable. **Perforation** is common. Gastric contents are black/tarry (acid hematin).
    *   *Nitric acid:* Stomach wall yellow, relatively firm. Perforation is rare.
    *   *Alkalis:* Mucosa is swollen, translucent, and soapy.

### Difference Between Chemical and Thermal Burns

| Feature | Thermal Burns | Chemical Burns |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cause** | Flames, hot solids, radiation | Corrosive acids or alkalis |
| **Appearance** | Blisters (vesicles) common | Blisters rare (except dilute acids); Staining/Discoloration present |
| **Hair** | Singed / Burnt | Corroded / Bleached but NOT singed |
| **Clothes** | Burnt (carbonaceous) | Corroded / Stained |
| **Reaction** | No chemical reaction | Chemical reaction in tissues (Acid/Alkali) |

### Mnemonics

*   **"Nitric is citrus"**: Nitric acid causes **Yellow** discoloration (like a lemon/sun).
*   **"Sulfuric is Soot"**: Sulfuric acid causes **Black** charring.
*   **"Alkali Licks"**: Alkalis cause **Liquefactive** necrosis (penetrates deep).
*   **"Acid Coags"**: Acids cause **Coagulative** necrosis (forms eschar).
