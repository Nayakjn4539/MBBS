# [[Principles Of Epidemiology And Epidemiologic Methods]] > Investigation of an Epidemic

### Investigation of an Epidemic

The occurrence of an [[Epidemic]] signals a significant shift in the balance between the Agent, Host, and Environment. An investigation is required to identify the cause and prevent further spread.

#### Definition
An epidemic is defined as the occurrence in a community or region of cases of an illness, specific health-related behavior, or other health-related events **clearly in excess of [[Normal Expectancy]]**.
*   **Epidemic Threshold:** Statistically, an epidemic exists when the number of cases exceeds **Mean + 2 Standard Deviations** of the endemic occurrence.

#### Objectives of Investigation
1.  Define the magnitude of the outbreak in terms of **Time, Place, and Person**.
2.  Determine specific conditions/factors responsible.
3.  Identify the cause, source of infection, and mode of transmission.
4.  Formulate recommendations to prevent recurrence.

#### 1. Verification of Diagnosis
*   This is the **first step**. Do not accept reports at face value as they may be spurious or misinterpretations by the public.
*   It is **not necessary** to examine all cases; a clinical examination of a sample of cases is sufficient.
*   **Action:** Laboratory confirmation is useful, but **epidemiological investigation should not be delayed** waiting for lab results.

#### 2. Confirmation of the Existence of an Epidemic
*   Compare the **observed frequency** of cases with the **expected frequency** (based on data from previous years for the same period).
*   An arbitrary limit of **two standard errors** from the endemic occurrence is often used to define the epidemic threshold.
*   *Note:* For diseases like [[Cholera]] or [[Smallpox]] (post-eradication), even a single case constitutes an epidemic/outbreak.

#### 3. Defining the Population at Risk
*   Obtain a detailed map of the area (natural landmarks, roads, dwelling units).
*   Calculate the appropriate **denominator** (the population at risk) to determine attack rates.
*   [[Census]] data may be used, but if the population is unstable, a local count is necessary.

#### 4. Rapid Search for All Cases
*   **Medical Survey:** Identify all affected individuals (including those who didn't seek care).
*   **[[Epidemiological Case Sheet]]:** Design a questionnaire collecting data on name, age, sex, occupation, time of onset, signs/symptoms, and history of exposure (food, water, travel).
*   **Search for secondary cases:** Search is carried out daily until the area is declared free of the epidemic.
    *   *Rule:* The area is declared free when a period equal to **twice the [[Incubation Period]]** of the disease has elapsed since the occurrence of the last case.

#### 5. Data Analysis
Analyze data using the classical epidemiological parameters:

*   **Time ([[Epidemic Curve]]):**
    *   Construct a graph of cases vs. time of onset.
    *   Look for **time clustering**.
    *   **Significance:** Helps distinguish between:
        *   **Point Source Epidemic:** Sharp rise and fall, cases within one incubation period (e.g., [[Food Poisoning]]).
        *   **Propagated Epidemic:** Gradual rise, person-to-person spread (e.g., [[Measles]]).

*   **Place ([[Spot Map]]):**
    *   Prepare a map showing the geographic distribution of cases.
    *   Look for **clustering** around a potential source (e.g., a water pump or factory).
    *   *Classic Example:* **John Snow's Spot Map** of the Broad Street Pump cholera outbreak.

> Spot map showing clustering of cases around a specific water source

*   **Person:**
    *   Analyze by age, sex, occupation, and exposure rates.
    *   Calculate **[[Attack Rate]]**:
        $$ \text{Attack Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of new cases}}{\text{Population at risk}} \times 100 $$

#### 6. Formulation of Hypothesis
*   Based on the analysis, formulate a tentative hypothesis explaining:
    *   Possible source of infection.
    *   Causative agent.
    *   Mode of spread.
    *   Environmental factors.

#### 7. Testing of Hypothesis
*   Evaluate the hypothesis by comparing attack rates in those **exposed** to the suspected factor vs. those **not exposed**.
*   Calculate [[Relative Risk]] (RR) or [[Odds Ratio]] (OR) to determine the strength of association.

#### 8. Evaluation of Ecological Factors
*   Investigate environmental conditions that allowed the epidemic to occur (e.g., breakdown in water supply, sanitary status of eating establishments, population movements, atmospheric changes).

#### 9. Further Investigation of Population at Risk
*   Medical examination or screening tests of the population (e.g., stool samples, blood for antibodies) to detect subclinical cases or carriers.

#### 10. Writing the Report
*   The final report should be complete and include:
    *   Background (geography, climate, demography).
    *   Historical data.
    *   Methodology of investigation.
    *   Analysis of data (Clinical, Epidemiological, Laboratory).
    *   Control measures implemented and their evaluation (Cost/Effectiveness).

### Important Concepts & Clinical Relevance

*   **[[Index Case]]:** The first case to come to the attention of the investigator.
*   **[[Primary Case]]:** The first case of the disease introduced into the population.
*   **[[Secondary Attack Rate]]:** The number of exposed persons developing the disease within the incubation period following exposure to the primary case. It measures **communicability**.
*   **Control Measures:** Control measures should **not be delayed** until the investigation is complete. They should be implemented immediately based on the working hypothesis (e.g., chlorination of wells if waterborne disease is suspected).
