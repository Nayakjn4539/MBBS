# [[Pharynx]] > Waldeyer's ring

### [[Waldeyer's ring]]

**Waldeyer's ring** (also known as the **nasopharyngeal lymphoid ring**) is a collection of subepithelial lymphoid tissue (Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue - [[MALT]]) organized in a ring-like manner at the entrance of the air and food passages (the [[pharynx]]),,.

#### Components
The ring is composed of the following lymphoid masses,,,:
1.  **[[Nasopharyngeal tonsil]] (Adenoids):** Situated in the midline at the junction of the roof and posterior wall of the [[nasopharynx]].
2.  **[[Palatine tonsils]] (Faucial tonsils):** Paired masses located in the lateral wall of the [[oropharynx]] between the anterior and posterior pillars.
3.  **[[Lingual tonsils]]:** Paired masses located on the posterior one-third of the base of the [[tongue]].
4.  **[[Tubal tonsils]] (Gerlach’s tonsils):** Situated in the [[nasopharynx]] around the opening of the [[Eustachian tube]] (specifically in the [[Fossa of Rosenmuller]]).
5.  **[[Lateral pharyngeal bands]]:** Descend from the tubal tonsil behind the posterior faucial pillars.
6.  **Discrete [[nodules]]:** Scattered in the subepithelial layer of the posterior pharyngeal wall.

#### Detailed Anatomy of Major Components

| Feature | **[[Nasopharyngeal Tonsil]] (Adenoids)** | **[[Palatine Tonsil]]** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Location** | Roof and posterior wall of [[nasopharynx]] | Lateral wall of [[oropharynx]] (Tonsillar fossa) |
| **Epithelium** | **Ciliated pseudostratified columnar** (Respiratory epithelium), | **Stratified squamous non-keratinized** epithelium |
| **Structure** | Vertical ridges separated by deep clefts | Mass with 15–20 [[crypts]] extending into the tissue |
| **Capsule** | **Absent**, | **Present** (Hemicapsule formed by [[pharyngobasilar fascia]]), |
| **Crypts** | **Absent** | **Present** (Largest is **[[Crypta magna]]**), |
| **Development** | Present at birth; physiological enlargement up to 6 yrs; atrophies by puberty (20 yrs) | Develops from the **2nd pharyngeal pouch** |

#### Physiology and Functions
The lymphoid tissue of Waldeyer's ring acts as a protective sentinel at the portal of the aerodigestive tract.

*   **Immunology:**
    *   Formation of [[lymphocytes]]: **B-lymphocytes** in germinal centers and **T-lymphocytes** in parafollicular regions,.
    *   Production of **[[Antibodies]]**: Specifically **IgA** (local immunity), IgG, IgM, and IgE,.
    *   Antigen processing: The specialized epithelium (containing M-cells) transports antigens to the subepithelial lymphoid follicles to initiate immune response.
*   **Lymphatic Characteristic:**
    *   The tonsils and lymphoid tissue of Waldeyer's ring have **efferent lymphatics** (draining away) but **no afferent lymphatics** (bringing lymph in),,.

#### Blood Supply
The ring generally receives blood supply from the branches of the **[[External carotid artery]]**.

*   **Adenoids:** Ascending palatine, ascending pharyngeal, and pharyngeal branch of maxillary artery,.
*   **Palatine Tonsils:** Main supply is the **tonsillar branch of the [[facial artery]]**,. Additional supply from ascending pharyngeal, dorsal lingual, and descending palatine arteries.

#### Clinical Implications

*   **[[Adenoid Hypertrophy]]:** Enlargement can obstruct the [[nasopharynx]] and [[Eustachian tube]], leading to:
    *   **[[Adenoid facies]]:** Dull face, open mouth, pinched nostrils, high arched palate.
    *   **[[Otitis media]]:** Due to Eustachian tube dysfunction.
    *   **[[Obstructive Sleep Apnea]] (OSA):** In children.
*   **[[Thornwaldt's cyst]]:** A cyst forming in the [[pharyngeal bursa]] (median recess within the adenoid mass), which is a remnant of the notochordal attachment,.
*   **[[Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma]]:** Common site of origin is the [[Fossa of Rosenmuller]] (near tubal tonsils),.
*   **Lymphoma:** Waldeyer's ring is a common site for extranodal Non-Hodgkin's [[Lymphoma]].
*   **[[Killian's dehiscence]]:** A potential gap in the inferior constrictor muscle near the pharynx, site for **[[Zenker's diverticulum]]**,.
