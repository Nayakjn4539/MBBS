# [[HEALTH PLANNING & MANAGEMENT]] > Percentage of fully immunized children is very low while left out & drop rates are unacceptably high in your block. What measures you will adopt as a BMOH to improve the situation?

### Measures to Improve Immunization Coverage as BMOH

As the **Block Medical Officer of Health (BMOH)**, the primary responsibility is to bridge the gap between the health system and the community to ensure **Universal Immunization Coverage (UIC)**. The strategy must tackle both **supply-side barriers** (logistics, planning) and **demand-side barriers** (awareness, acceptance).

The intervention plan is categorized into five strategic phases:

### 1. Situation Analysis and Root Cause Identification
Before acting, it is crucial to understand *why* the rates are low.
*   **Review Meetings:** Convene a meeting with Medical Officers, [[Health Supervisors]], LHVs, and ANMs to analyze sub-centre wise data.
*   **Data Analysis:** Differentiate between **Left-outs** (unreached populations) and **Dropouts** (started but didn't finish).
    *   *High Left-outs:* Indicates poor access or lack of registration.
    *   *High Dropouts:* Indicates dissatisfaction, migration, or lack of tracking.
*   **Coverage Evaluation Survey:** Conduct a **30-cluster sampling survey** (WHO method) to assess actual coverage and reasons for failure (e.g., fear of side effects, timing inconvenience).

### 2. Strengthening Micro-planning
A robust [[Micro-plan]] is the backbone of the immunization program.
*   **Head Count Survey:** Instruct ANMs and [[ASHA]]s to conduct a fresh house-to-house survey to enumerate all beneficiaries (pregnant women and children 0-5 years).
*   **Updating Registers:** Ensure the **MCH Register/RCH Register** and the **Due List** are updated to include floating/migratory populations (brick kilns, construction sites).
*   **Mapping High-Risk Areas:** Identify "hard-to-reach" areas, urban slums, and hamlets with resistant groups. Map these for **outreach sessions**.
*   **Session Planning:** Ensure immunization sessions are planned on **fixed days** and **fixed sites** (e.g., [[Village Health and Nutrition Day]] - VHND).

### 3. Strengthening Service Delivery (Supply Side)
Ensure that when a beneficiary comes, they are not turned away.
*   **Cold Chain Maintenance:** Verify the functionality of [[Ice Lined Refrigerators (ILR)]] and Deep Freezers. Ensure **no stock-outs** of vaccines, diluents, and AD syringes.
*   **Alternate Vaccine Delivery (AVD):** Streamline the system to transport vaccines from the Cold Chain Point to the session site safely and on time.
*   **Tracking Systems:**
    *   **Mother and Child Tracking System (MCTS)/RCH Portal:** Ensure name-based entry of all beneficiaries.
    *   **Tickler Bag/Box System:** Enforce the use of the tracking bag at sub-centres to visually identify dropouts and generate a "Due List" before every session.
*   **Immunization Cards:** Ensure every child is issued a **Mamta Card/MCP Card** (Mother and Child Protection Card).

### 4. Demand Generation (Community Mobilization)
*   **Involvement of Frontline Workers:**
    *   **ASHA:** Incentivize [[ASHA]] workers for mobilizing children to the session site (as per JSY/UIP norms).
    *   **Anganwadi Workers (AWW):** Coordinate to use Anganwadi centres as session sites.
*   **Information, Education, and Communication (IEC):**
    *   Address myths regarding **AEFI** (Adverse Events Following Immunization).
    *   Use folk media, wall paintings, and interpersonal communication (IPC) to explain the benefits of completing the schedule.
*   **Community Leaders:** Engage Panchayati Raj Institution (PRI) members, religious leaders, and teachers to advocate for vaccination, especially in resistant pockets.

### 5. Monitoring and Supervision
*   **Regular Review:** Conduct monthly review meetings at the Block PHC to discuss the "Due list vs. Actual Achievement."
*   **Supportive Supervision:** The BMOH and Health Supervisors must visit **10% of immunization sessions** (especially in poor-performing sub-centres) to check:
    *   Injection safety.
    *   Correct recording in registers.
    *   Cold chain status ([[Vaccine Vial Monitor]] - VVM check).
*   **Feedback:** Provide constructive feedback to ANMs and reward high-performing workers to boost morale.

### 6. Special Strategies
*   **Mission Indradhanush:** Launch catch-up campaigns (like [[Mission Indradhanush]] or Intensified MI) to target unvaccinated and partially vaccinated children in low-coverage pockets.
*   **Mop-up Rounds:** If a specific disease outbreak (e.g., Measles) occurs or specific pockets are identified, conduct door-to-door vaccination drives.

### Summary Table: Problem vs. Solution

| Problem Area | Possible Cause | BMOH Intervention |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High Left-outs** | Unregistered births, remote areas, migration. | **Head Count Survey**, Mobile teams, [[Mission Indradhanush]]. |
| **High Dropouts** | Fear of AEFI, loss of card, migration, rude staff. | **Tickler Bag System**, ASHA mobilization, Soft-skill training for ANMs. |
| **Supply Gaps** | Vaccine stock-out, broken equipment. | **Cold Chain maintenance**, Alternate Vaccine Delivery (AVD). |

**Mnemonic for Steps: "RE-VAMP"**
*   **R** - Review data (Situation Analysis)
*   **E** - Enumerate beneficiaries (Head count survey)
*   **V** - Vaccinate (Conduct sessions/Catch-up rounds)
*   **A** - Awareness (IEC/BCC)
*   **M** - Monitor (Supervision)
*   **P** - Plan (Micro-planning)

**Clinical Relevance:**
High dropout rates lead to a buildup of susceptible children, shattering **herd immunity**. This significantly increases the risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) like **Measles** and **Diphtheria** within the block. Immediate rectification is vital to prevent infant mortality.
