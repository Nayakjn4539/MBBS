# [[Placido's Disc]] (Keratoscope)

[[Placido's Disc]], also known as a **Keratoscope**, is a handheld ophthalmic instrument used for the qualitative assessment of the curvature and surface regularity of the [[cornea]]. It is the precursor to modern [[computerized corneal topography]].

## Principle
The instrument operates on the optical principle that the anterior surface of the [[cornea]] acts as a **convex mirror**,.
*   The size and shape of the image reflected by the cornea vary according to its curvature.
*   The greater the curvature of the mirror (cornea), the smaller the image.
*   Irregularities in the corneal surface cause distortion of the reflected image.

## Structure and Design
*   **Appearance:** It consists of a flat, circular disc painted with alternating **black and white concentric rings** (circles),.
*   **Viewing Aperture:** There is a small hole in the center of the disc through which the examiner observes the patient's eye.
*   **Handle:** It is usually mounted on a handle for hand-held use.

## Method of Examination (Keratoscopy)
1.  **Patient Position:** The patient is seated with a light source placed behind them and slightly above their head.
2.  **Examiner Position:** The examiner stands in front of the patient, holding the [[Placido's Disc]] by its handle.
3.  **Procedure:** The examiner looks through the central hole of the disc. The light from behind the patient illuminates the disc, and its reflection (image of the rings) is cast upon the patient's [[cornea]],.
4.  **Observation:** The examiner observes the shape, regularity, and sharpness of the reflected rings (mires) on the corneal surface.

## Interpretation of Findings

The reflection of the concentric rings on the cornea provides information about the corneal topography:

| Observation | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Uniform, sharp, circular rings** | **Normal Cornea**. The surface is smooth and spherical. |
| **Horizontally Oval Rings** | **With-the-rule [[Astigmatism]]**. The vertical meridian is steeper. |
| **Vertically Oval Rings** | **Against-the-rule [[Astigmatism]]**. The horizontal meridian is steeper. |
| **Distorted/Irregular Rings** | **Irregular [[Astigmatism]]** or **[[Keratoconus]]**. |
| **Loss of sharpness/Wavy lines** | **Loss of corneal surface polish** (e.g., [[Corneal edema]], [[Dry eye]], [[Corneal ulcer]], or abrasions),. |
| **Crowding of rings** | Steepening of the cornea (seen in **[[Keratoconus]]**). |

### Clinical Implications
*   **[[Keratoconus]] Screening:** In early stages, distortion of the rings can be a sensitive indicator before overt signs like Munson's sign appear.
*   **Surface Integrity:** A loss in the sharpness of the outline of the rings denotes a loss of the normal 'polish' or 'sheen' of the corneal surface, indicating epithelial defects or [[dry eye syndrome]].
*   **Irregular Astigmatism:** It is particularly useful for detecting irregular [[astigmatism]] which cannot be fully characterized by standard [[keratometry]].

## Limitations and Modern Advances
*   **Qualitative only:** The traditional handheld disc provides a subjective, qualitative assessment. It does not give quantitative data (dioptric power).
*   **Evolution:** The principle of [[Placido's Disc]] has been incorporated into modern **Photokeratoscopes** and **[[Computerized Corneal Topography]]** systems. These systems capture the image of the projected rings and analyze thousands of points to generate a color-coded map of the corneal power and curvature,.
