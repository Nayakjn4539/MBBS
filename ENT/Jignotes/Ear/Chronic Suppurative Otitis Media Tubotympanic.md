# [[Ear]] > Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media Tubotympanic

**Synonyms:** Safe type, Benign type, Mucosal type CSOM.

### **Definition**
Chronic infection or inflammation of the middle ear cleft associated with a permanent **central perforation** of the [[tympanic membrane]] and intermittent or persistent **otorrhea** for a duration typically greater than 3 months,.
*   It involves the **anteroinferior part** of the middle ear cleft (Eustachian tube and mesotympanum).
*   It is termed "Safe" because it is rarely associated with serious bony erosion or intracranial complications.

### **Aetiology**
*   **Sequela of Acute Otitis Media (AOM):** Usually follows an episode of AOM (especially necrotizing type following exanthematous fevers) that leaves a large central perforation.
*   **Ascending Infections:** Infection spreads via the [[Eustachian tube]] from the nose, sinuses, or nasopharynx (tonsillitis, adenoiditis).
*   **Allergy:** Persistent mucoid otorrhea may result from food or inhalant allergies.

### **Pathology**
The disease process is localized to the middle ear [[mucosa]]. The pathology varies based on the activity of the disease,.

#### **Stages of Tubotympanic CSOM**
1.  **Active Stage:**
    *   Middle ear mucosa is edematous, velvety, and pink (hyperemic).
    *   Presence of mucopurulent discharge.
    *   Increased activity of **goblet cells**.
2.  **Inactive Stage:**
    *   Permanent central perforation exists.
    *   Middle ear mucosa looks normal (pale pink).
    *   Ear is dry.
3.  **Quiescent Stage:**
    *   Ear is dry, but the mucosa is not fully normal; it may be potentially active.
4.  **Healed Stage:**
    *   The perforation heals with a thin atrophic scar (dimeric membrane) or shows [[tympanosclerosis]] (chalky white plaques).

### **Clinical Features**

#### **Symptoms**
*   **Ear Discharge (Otorrhea):**
    *   **Nature:** Mucoid or mucopurulent.
    *   **Quantity:** Profuse.
    *   **Odor:** **Non-foul smelling** (odorless),.
    *   **Periodicity:** Usually intermittent (associated with Upper Respiratory Tract Infections) but can be constant.
*   **Hearing Loss:**
    *   Conductive type.
    *   Usually mild to moderate (≤50 dB).
*   **Pain:** Usually absent. If present, suggests associated otitis externa or an acute exacerbation.

#### **Signs (Otoscopy Findings)**
*   **Perforation:**
    *   **Type:** **[[Central Perforation]]**.
    *   **Location:** Pars tensa (usually anteroinferior or extensive).
    *   **Key Feature:** The perforation is completely surrounded by residual tympanic membrane, and the **fibrous annulus is intact**,.
*   **Middle Ear Mucosa:**
    *   Velvety red (active) or pale pink (inactive).
*   **Polyp:**
    *   If present, it is usually **pale**, smooth, and arises from the mucosa (unlike the fleshy red polyp of unsafe disease),.
*   **Ossicular Chain:**
    *   Usually intact and mobile. Necrosis may occur in the long process of the [[incus]].

### **Microbiology**
Infection is often mixed (aerobic and anaerobic):
*   **Aerobes:** *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, *Proteus*, *Escherichia coli*, *Staphylococcus aureus*.
*   **Anaerobes:** *Bacteroides fragilis*, Anaerobic *Streptococci*.

### **Investigation**
*   **Examination under Microscope (EUM):** To assess the exact site of perforation, status of mucosa, and ossicular integrity.
*   **Culture and Sensitivity:** Of the ear discharge to guide antibiotic therapy.
*   **[[Pure Tone Audiometry]] (PTA):** To assess the degree of [[conductive hearing loss]].
*   **Patch Test:** A paper patch is placed over the perforation; improvement in hearing confirms the ossicular chain is intact,.
*   **X-ray Mastoid / CT Temporal Bone:** Mastoid is usually **sclerotic** or pneumatized with cell clouding. There is **no bony erosion**.

### **Differential Diagnosis: Tubotympanic vs. Atticoantral CSOM**

| Feature | Tubotympanic (Safe / Mucosal) | Atticoantral (Unsafe / Squamous) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Site** | Anteroinferior cleft (Eustachian tube area) | Posterosuperior cleft (Attic/Mastoid) |
| **Pathology** | Mucosal inflammation | [[Cholesteatoma]] / Bone erosion |
| **Discharge** | Profuse, Mucoid, Odorless | Scanty, Purulent, Foul-smelling |
| **Perforation** | **Central** (Pars Tensa) | **Attic** or **Marginal** |
| **Polyp** | Pale, mucosal | Fleshy, red, granulation tissue |
| **Complications**| Rare | Common (Intracranial/Intratemporal) |
| **Annulus** | Intact | Eroded |

### **Treatment**

**Goals:** Control infection (make the ear dry) and restore hearing.

#### **1. Conservative Management (Aural Toilet)**
*   **Dry Mopping:** Using sterile cotton buds or suction clearance under a microscope.
*   **Ear Drops:** Antibiotic drops (e.g., Neomycin, Gentamicin, Ciprofloxacin) often combined with steroids to reduce inflammation.
    *   *Clinical Implication:* Use caution with aminoglycosides due to potential ototoxicity, though risk is low in topical use if not used for prolonged periods.
*   **Systemic Antibiotics:** Useful in acute exacerbations or profuse discharge.
*   **Treatment of Septic Foci:** Address tonsillitis, adenoiditis, or sinusitis to prevent ascending infection.

#### **2. Surgical Management**
Once the ear is dry (inactive stage), reconstructive surgery is planned.
*   **[[Myringoplasty]]:** Repair of the tympanic membrane perforation using a graft (temporalis fascia),.
    *   *Prerequisite:* Dry ear, good cochlear reserve, patent Eustachian tube.
*   **[[Tympanoplasty]]:**
    *   Eradication of disease + Repair of TM + Reconstruction of ossicular chain.
    *   **Cortical Mastoidectomy** may be added if the mastoid is a reservoir of infection.

> **Mnemonic for Tubotympanic CSOM:** **"SAFE"**
> *   **S** - Safe type (No cholesteatoma)
> *   **A** - Anteroinferior involvement
> *   **F** - Foul smell absent (Odorless discharge)
> *   **E** - Eustachian tube route (Ascending infection)
