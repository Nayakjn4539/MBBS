# [[Asphyxia]] > test to detect Drowning and inferences

### Tests for Diagnosis of Drowning

Diagnosing death by [[drowning]] is one of the most difficult tasks in forensic pathology, especially if the body is decomposed. The diagnosis often relies on the exclusion of other causes and positive signs of fluid aspiration.

The tests are broadly classified into **Biological Tests** (Diatoms) and **Biochemical Tests** (Electrolytes/Specific gravity).

---

### 1. Diatom Test (Biological Test)
This is considered the most reliable proof of **antemortem drowning**, particularly in decomposed bodies where other signs have vanished.

**Principle:**
*   [[Diatoms]] are microscopic unicellular algae (Class *Bacillariophyceae*) found in fresh and sea water.
*   They have a hard, siliceous outer shell (frustule) that resists acid digestion, heat, and putrefaction.
*   **Mechanism:** When a live person drowns, they inhale water containing diatoms. Due to violent respiratory efforts, the alveolar walls rupture. Diatoms penetrate the alveolar membrane $\rightarrow$ enter pulmonary veins $\rightarrow$ reach the left side of the heart $\rightarrow$ are pumped via systemic circulation to distant organs (Brain, Liver, Kidney, Bone Marrow).
*   In **postmortem submersion**, water (and diatoms) may passively enter the lungs but cannot reach distant organs due to the lack of circulation.

**Procedure:**
1.  **Sample Collection:**
    *   **Bone Marrow:** Ideally from the [[femur]] or sternum. 
    *   **Viscera:** Brain, liver, or kidney.
    *   **Control Sample:** Water from the site of drowning.
2.  **Acid Digestion:** The tissue (approx. 5-10g) is digested using strong acids (Nitric acid + Sulphuric acid) for 24–48 hours. This destroys organic tissue but leaves the silica shells of diatoms intact.
3.  **Microscopy:** The residue is centrifuged and examined under a phase-contrast microscope.

**Inference:**
*   **Positive:** Presence of diatoms in the bone marrow or distant organs (brain/liver) matching those found in the drowning medium indicates **antemortem drowning**.
*   **Negative:** Does not rule out drowning (e.g., "Dry Drowning" or rapid death).

**Limitations:**
*   Diatoms may be present in air, food, or water, leading to potential contamination.
*   Only diatoms smaller than 60 microns usually penetrate the alveolar barrier.

### 2. Gettler’s Test (Chloride Test)
This is a biochemical test comparing the chloride content of blood from the right and left chambers of the heart.

**Principle:**
*   Based on the electrolyte changes caused by the aspiration of fluid into the lungs and subsequent movement into the blood.
*   **Fresh Water Drowning:** Water is hypotonic $\rightarrow$ absorbed into pulmonary circulation $\rightarrow$ **Hemodilution**. Blood in the Left Heart has **decreased** Chloride concentration.
*   **Salt Water Drowning:** Water is hypertonic $\rightarrow$ draws fluid from blood into alveoli $\rightarrow$ **Hemoconcentration**. Blood in the Left Heart has **increased** Chloride concentration.

**Inference:**
*   A difference of at least **25%** in chloride concentration between the left and right sides of the heart is considered significant.

| Drowning Medium | Left Heart Chloride | Right Heart Chloride | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fresh Water** | Low | High | Cl (Left) < Cl (Right) |
| **Salt Water** | High | Low | Cl (Left) > Cl (Right) |

**Limitations:**
*   Of little value if the patent has a patent foramen ovale (blood mixing).
*   Not reliable in putrefied bodies (diffusion of electrolytes).
*   Not useful in dry drowning or vagal inhibition.

> **Mnemonic for Hemodynamics:**
> *   **F**resh water = **F**loods the blood (**Hemodilution**, Hypervolemia).
> *   **S**alt water = **S**hrinks the blood (**Hemoconcentration**, Hypovolemia).

### 3. Specific Gravity Test of Plasma
Similar principle to Gettler's test but measures specific gravity instead of chloride.

**Inference:**
*   **Fresh Water:** Left atrial blood has **lower** specific gravity than right atrial blood.
*   **Salt Water:** Left atrial blood has **higher** specific gravity than right atrial blood.

---

### 4. Magnesium and Strontium Test
These are trace elements found in sea water.
*   **Strontium:** Considered a reliable marker as it is chemically stable.
*   **Inference:**
    *   **Salt water drowning:** High levels of Magnesium and Strontium in the Left Ventricle compared to the Right Ventricle.
    *   Also helpful if found in peripheral blood.

### 5. Histological Examination
Microscopic examination of the lungs is crucial.

**Findings:**
*   **[[Emphysema Aquosum]]:** Dilated, over-distended alveoli with thinned-out or ruptured septa.
*   **Pale/Anemic Lung:** Compression of alveolar capillaries due to over-distension.
*   Usually little or no inflammatory reaction (death is rapid), but inhaled particulate matter (sand, silt, algae) may be seen in bronchioles.

### Summary of Autopsy Findings (Corroborative)

**External:**
*   **Froth:** Fine, white, lathery, persistent froth at mouth and nostrils (Pathognomonic).
*   **[[Cadaveric Spasm]]:** Firm grasping of weeds, grass, or mud in hands (Proof of life at the time of submersion).
*   **Cutis Anserina:** Goosebumps (non-specific).
*   **Washerwoman’s Hands/Feet:** Bleached, wrinkled skin (Suggests immersion duration, not cause of death).

**Internal:**
*   **Ballooning of Lungs:** Voluminous, heavy, edematous lungs covering the pericardium. Rib markings may be seen on the lung surface.
*   **[[Paltauf's Hemorrhages]]:** Large, pale, subpleural hemorrhages (due to alveolar rupture).
*   **Water in Stomach:** Finding water/mud consistent with the drowning medium in the stomach/intestines.

### Medicolegal Aspects
1.  **Accidental:** Most common form (swimming, falling into wells).
2.  **Suicidal:** Common. Often associated with 'hesitation marks' or tying of limbs.
3.  **Homicidal:** Rare. Look for signs of struggle, injuries inconsistent with fall, or marks of violence (e.g., throttling) to rule out disposal of a dead body into water (Postmortem immersion).
4.  **Diatom test** is legally significant to prove the victim was alive when entering the water and to link the site of drowning (by matching diatom species).
