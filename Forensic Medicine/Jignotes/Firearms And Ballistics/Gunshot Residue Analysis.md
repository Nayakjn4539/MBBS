# [[Firearms And Ballistics]] > Gunshot Residue Analysis

### Gunshot Residue (GSR) Analysis

**Gunshot Residue (GSR)**, also known as Cartridge Discharge Residue (CDR) or Firearm Discharge Residue (FDR), is the particulate matter deposited on the hands, clothes, or body of the shooter and the victim following the discharge of a firearm. Its analysis is a critical component of [[Forensic Ballistics]].

### 1. Composition of GSR
When a firearm is discharged, a plume of gaseous and particulate matter is ejected from the muzzle (and breech/cylinder gap). This residue consists of:

**A. Primer Residues (Most Specific)**
The primer cup contains impact-sensitive explosives. The detection of these metallic elements is the primary focus of modern GSR analysis.
*   **Lead peroxide/styphnate** (Initiator)
*   **Barium nitrate** (Oxidizer)
*   **Antimony sulphide** (Fuel)
*   Tetrazine

**B. Propellant Residues (Gunpowder)**
*   **Black Powder:** Potassium nitrate (75%), Sulphur (10%), Charcoal (15%).
*   **Smokeless Powder:**
    *   *Single Base:* [[Nitrocellulose]].
    *   *Double Base:* Nitrocellulose + [[Nitroglycerine]].
    *   *Triple Base:* Nitrocellulose + Nitroglycerine + Nitroguanidine.
*   Residues include unburnt or partially burnt powder particles, nitrates, and nitrites.

**C. Other Components**
*   **Metallic debris:** From the projectile (lead, copper, nickel) or the barrel/cartridge case (brass, zinc).
*   **Lubricants/Grease:** From the bullet cannelure or barrel.
*   **Soot:** Carbonaceous material from combustion.

### 2. Distribution and Deposition
GSR settles on surfaces based on proximity to the discharge.

*   **On the Shooter:**
    *   Due to the "blowback" phenomenon or leakage from the breech/cylinder gap.
    *   **Location:** Typically found on the **dorsum (back) of the firing hand**, specifically the thumb, index finger, and the connecting web space,.
    *   In rifles/shotguns, residue may be found on the non-firing hand used to steady the weapon.
*   **On the Victim:**
    *   Depends on the [[Range of Fire]].
    *   **Contact/Close Range:** Heavy deposition of soot (blackening) and powder particles (tattooing) around the wound.
    *   **Distant Range:** Usually absent, except for the **Bullet Wipe** (Grease collar) on the wound margins.

### 3. Collection of GSR Samples
Time is critical. GSR can be lost by washing hands, rubbing, or normal activity. Samples should be collected as soon as possible.

1.  **Swabbing:** Cotton-tipped swabs moistened with dilute acid (5% Nitric acid or Hydrochloric acid) are used to swab the palms and backs of hands. A control swab is mandatory,.
2.  **Adhesive Tapes/Lifts:** Special sticky tapes (stubs) lift particles for SEM analysis.
3.  **Clothing:** The area of powder tattooing/blackening should be covered with cellophane/paper and packed carefully to prevent loss of particles.
4.  **Control Samples:** Samples from the hands of non-shooters (associates) or background environment to rule out contamination.

### 4. Detection Techniques (The Tests)

#### A. Screening/Color Tests (Mostly Obsolete)
These rely on chemical reactions producing color changes. They suffer from low specificity.

1.  **Dermal Nitrate Test (Paraffin Test):**
    *   **Method:** Hot paraffin wax cast of the hand is treated with **Diphenylamine** reagent.
    *   **Result:** Blue flecks/color indicates nitrates/nitrites.
    *   **Drawback:** **Non-specific.** Gives false positives with fertilizers, tobacco, urine, legumes, and match heads. Hence, largely abandoned,.
2.  **Harrison-Gilroy Test:**
    *   **Target:** Detects Lead, Antimony, and Barium (Primer residues).
    *   **Method:** Chemical spot test using Sodium Rhodizonate (for Pb/Ba) and Triphenylmethylarsonium iodide (for Sb).
    *   **Result:** Red (Lead), Blue (Barium), Orange (Antimony).
    *   **Drawback:** Low sensitivity.

#### B. Confirmatory/Modern Instrumental Analysis
These provide quantitative and qualitative data and are legally admissible.

1.  **Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA):**
    *   **Principle:** Sample bombarded with neutrons to form radioisotopes.
    *   **Target:** Detects **Antimony** and **Barium**.
    *   **Pros:** Highly sensitive (quantitative).
    *   **Cons:** Expensive, requires a nuclear reactor, cannot detect Lead, slow process.
2.  **Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS) / Flameless AAS (FAAS):**
    *   **Target:** Detects **Lead**, **Barium**, **Antimony**, and **Copper**,.
    *   **Principle:** Measures light absorption by ground-state atoms.
    *   **Pros:** Sensitive and widely used.
3.  **Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (SEM-EDXA):**
    *   **Status:** The **"Gold Standard"** for GSR analysis.
    *   **Principle:** SEM visualizes the **morphology** (shape) of particles, while EDX determines the **elemental composition**.
    *   **Specific Finding:** Spherical particles containing Lead, Barium, and Antimony fused together.
    *   **Pros:** Highest specificity; can distinguish environmental contaminants from true GSR.

> *   **A**tomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS)
> *   **N**eutron Activation Analysis (NAA)
> *   **D**ermal Nitrate Test (Obsolete)
> *   **S**EM-EDXA (Gold Standard)

### 5. Medico-legal Aspects & Autopsy Findings

*   **Determination of Shooter:** Presence of GSR on the dorsum of the hand strongly suggests the individual fired a weapon or was in very close proximity to a discharge.
*   **Differentiation of Suicide vs. Homicide:**
    *   **Suicide:** GSR is typically found on the firing hand. In handgun suicides, GSR may be on the palm if the gun was cradled. In rifle/shotgun suicides, GSR is often on the non-firing hand used to steady the muzzle.
    *   **Homicide:** Victim usually has no GSR on hands unless they raised hands in defense (defensive posture) near the weapon.
*   **Range of Fire Determination:**
    *   **Blackening (Soot):** Indicates Close range (up to 30 cm for handguns).
    *   **Tattooing (Stippling):** Indicates Near/Intermediate range (up to 60-90 cm). These are antemortem injuries caused by unburnt powder embedding in the skin.
    *   **Absence of GSR:** Suggests Distant shot (or intervention by clothing).
*   **False Negatives:** GSR can be washed off, rubbed off, or lost due to delay in collection (blood, sweat, rain).
*   **Kennedy Phenomenon:** Surgical alteration or suturing of the gunshot wound may remove/obscure GSR, making range determination difficult,.
