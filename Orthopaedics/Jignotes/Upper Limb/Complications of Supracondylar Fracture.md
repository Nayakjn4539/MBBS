# Complications of Supracondylar Fracture of Humerus

The complications of [[supracondylar fracture]] of the humerus can be broadly classified based on the time of onset into **Immediate**, **Early**, and **Late** complications. This fracture is notorious for severe complications if not managed promptly and accurately.

## 1. Immediate Complications (At the time of injury)

These occur due to the sharp proximal fragment of the humerus damaging surrounding structures.

### A. Vascular Injury
*   **Structure Involved:** [[Brachial artery]].
*   **Incidence:** Occurs in approximately 1% of cases, though vasospasm is more common.
*   **Mechanism:** The sharp anterior spike of the proximal fragment (in extension type fractures) pierces or compresses the artery.
*   **Clinical Presentation:**
    *   Absent radial pulse.
    *   **"Pink Pulseless Hand":** The hand is warm and pink despite an absent pulse due to adequate collateral circulation. This requires close monitoring but not immediate exploration.
    *   **"Pale Pulseless Hand":** The hand is cold, pale, and painful. This is a surgical emergency requiring immediate reduction and potential exploration.

### B. Nerve Injury
Nerve injuries are common (approx. 10-15%) but are usually **neuropraxia** (transient functional block) and recover spontaneously.

| Type of Fracture | Most Common Nerve Injured |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Extension Type (Overall)** | [[Anterior Interosseous Nerve]] (Branch of Median Nerve) |
| **Extension Type (Posterolateral displacement)** | [[Median Nerve]] |
| **Extension Type (Posteromedial displacement)** | [[Radial Nerve]] |
| **Flexion Type** | [[Ulnar Nerve]] |

**Clinical Testing for Nerve Injuries:**
*   **Anterior Interosseous Nerve (AIN):** Ask the patient to make an 'OK' sign. Inability to flex the IP joint of the thumb and DIP joint of the index finger indicates injury (Pointign Index).
*   **Radial Nerve:** Wrist drop (inability to extend wrist/fingers).
*   **Ulnar Nerve:** Loss of sensation in little finger; clawing (late sign).

## 2. Early Complications (First few days)

### A. Compartment Syndrome
This is the most widely feared complication leading to tissue necrosis due to increased pressure within a closed osteofascial space.

*   **Pathophysiology:** Edema or bleeding $\rightarrow$ Increased intra-compartmental pressure $\rightarrow$ Venous outflow obstruction $\rightarrow$ Arterial occlusion $\rightarrow$ Muscle and nerve ischemia.
*   **Clinical Features (The 5 Ps):**
    1.  **Pain:** *The earliest and most significant sign.* **Pain on passive stretch** of fingers is the hallmark.
    2.  **Pallor:** Pale skin.
    3.  **Paresthesia:** Tingling/numbness (early sign of nerve ischemia).
    4.  **Paralysis:** Late sign.
    5.  **Pulselessness:** Very late sign (diagnosis should be made *before* the pulse disappears).

*   **Management:**
    *   Remove all constrictive dressings/casts immediately.
    *   Extend the elbow (if flexed).
    *   **Fasciotomy:** If symptoms do not improve rapidly or pressures remain high.

### B. Volkmann’s Ischemia
If compartment syndrome is untreated, it progresses to **Volkmann’s Ischemia**.
*   **Stages:**
    1.  **Impending Ischemia:** Pain on passive extension of fingers (Stretch sign).
    2.  **Established Ischemia:** Paralysis and sensory loss.
    3.  **Established Contracture:** Permanent fibrosis of muscles.

**Clinical Implication:** **Volkmann's Sign**: Flexion of the wrist allows passive extension of fingers, but dorsiflexion of the wrist causes flexion of fingers (due to shortened flexor muscles).

## 3. Late Complications (Weeks to Years)

### A. Malunion (Cubitus Varus / Gunstock Deformity)
This is the **most common complication** of supracondylar fractures (approx. 30-50% in conservatively treated displaced fractures).

*   **Deformity:** The forearm deviates medially (Varus) when the elbow is extended.
*   **Cause:** Malunion due to **medial tilt** and **internal rotation** of the distal fragment. *Note: It is not caused by growth plate injury.*
*   **Functional Status:** It is primarily a **cosmetic deformity**; elbow function is usually preserved.
*   **Treatment:** Corrective osteotomy (e.g., **Modified French Osteotomy**) is performed after skeletal maturity or earlier if severe.

### B. Myositis Ossificans
*   **Definition:** Heterotopic ossification (formation of bone) within the muscle.
*   **Common Site:** [[Brachialis]] muscle.
*   **Risk Factors:**
    *   Massage of the elbow (strictly contraindicated).
    *   Forceful passive mobilization.
    *   Delayed reduction (repeated manipulation).
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Active Phase:** Rest, NSAIDs, stop passive movements.
    *   **Mature Phase:** Surgical excision if it causes mechanical block (only after the bone mass has matured and ALP levels are normal).

### C. Volkmann’s Ischemic Contracture (VIC)
The sequel to untreated compartment syndrome. Muscle tissue is replaced by fibrous tissue.
*   **Affected Muscles:** [[Flexor Digitorum Profundus]] (FDP) and [[Flexor Pollicis Longus]] (FPL) are most commonly affected.
*   **Deformity:** Claw hand deformity, stiff wrist.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Mild:** Turnbuckle splinting, physiotherapy.
    *   **Moderate:** **Max Page Operation** (Muscle sliding operation - releasing flexor origin).
    *   **Severe:** Carpectomy (shortening of bone) or tendon transfers.

### D. Stiffness of Elbow
*   Loss of range of motion (especially extension) is common.
*   Caused by peri-articular fibrosis or malunion.
*   Prevention: Stable fixation allowing early active motion.

### E. Tardy Ulnar Nerve Palsy
*   Occurs years after the injury.
*   **Cause:** Usually follows **Lateral Condyle Fracture** (Cubitus Valgus), but can occur in supracondylar malunion if the nerve is stretched over a deformity or trapped in scar tissue.
