# [[GENETICS & HEALTH & MENTAL HEALTH]] > Prospective Genetic counselling is more rewarding

### Prospective Genetic Counselling

**Prospective Genetic Counselling** allows for the true prevention of disease and is considered the most effective approach in genetics. Unlike retrospective counselling, which occurs *after* a genetic disorder has already manifested in the family, prospective counselling takes a proactive stance.

#### 1. Definition and Concept
It identifies [[heterozygous individuals]] (carriers) for a particular genetic defect through screening procedures **before** they develop symptoms themselves or produce their first affected child,,.

*   **Aim:** To explain to carrier individuals the risk of having affected children if they marry another heterozygote for the same gene.
*   **Outcome:** By preventing or reducing **heterozygous marriages**, the prospects of giving birth to affected children are diminished, thereby reducing the incidence of the disease in the community.

#### 2. Why is it "More Rewarding"?
It is considered more rewarding than retrospective counselling for the following reasons:
*   **True Prevention:** It offers the possibility of preventing the disease entirely rather than managing it after occurrence.
*   **Psychological Relief:** It avoids the psychological trauma associated with the birth of a defective child or the difficult decision of terminating a pregnancy (which often happens in retrospective cases).
*   **Wider Impact:** It has the potential for a wider application to cover a number of **recessive defects** in the general population, whereas retrospective counselling is limited to families where a case has already occurred.

#### 3. Common Indications and Examples
This approach is technically possible only when **carriers** can be accurately identified. It is classically applied in:
1.  **[[Sickle cell anemia]]:** Screening populations to identify carriers and advising against marriage between two carriers,.
2.  **[[Thalassemia]]:** Screening for thalassemia minor to prevent thalassemia major in offspring.
3.  **Tay-Sachs disease:** In specific high-risk populations.

#### 4. Comparison: Prospective vs. Retrospective Counselling

| Feature | Prospective Genetic Counselling | Retrospective Genetic Counselling |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Timing** | Performed **before** conception or marriage. | Performed **after** a hereditary disorder has occurred in the family. |
| **Target Group** | Heterozygous individuals (Carriers) identified via screening. | Families with an already affected child. |
| **Objective** | To prevent the *first* occurrence of the disease. | To prevent *recurrence* or manage future risks. |
| **Methods** | Carrier screening, Premarital checks. | Contraception, Pregnancy termination, Sterilization. |
| **Scope** | **True Prevention** of disease. | Secondary prevention or management. |

#### 5. Mnemonic
To remember the benefits of **PRO**spective counselling: **PRO**
*   **P** - **P**revents disease before it happens (True prevention).
*   **R** - **R**educes heterozygous marriages.
*   **O** - **O**ptimal for recessive traits (e.g., Sickle cell, Thalassemia).

#### 6. Clinical Relevance
In clinical practice, prospective counselling is heavily reliant on **mass screening programs**. For instance, in communities with a high prevalence of [[hemoglobinopathies]], pre-marital screening allows couples to know their status. If both partners are carriers (e.g., for Thalassemia minor), they are counselled regarding the 25% risk of having a child with **Thalassemia Major** in each pregnancy, allowing them to make informed reproductive choices such as adoption, gamete donation, or prenatal diagnosis,.
