# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > One adult man has attended your hospital with complaints of fever, emaciation, abdominal swelling and darkening of skin. He had history of travel to Bihar. What is the most probable diagnosis? How the disease can be treated? What are the preventive and control measures for the disease?

### Most Probable Diagnosis

The most probable diagnosis is **[[Visceral Leishmaniasis]]**, commonly known as **[[Kala-azar]]**.

*   **Clinical Justification:**
    *   **Fever:** Irregular bouts of fever are a hallmark sign.
    *   **Emaciation:** Significant weight loss and cachexia are common.
    *   **Abdominal Swelling:** Caused by massive **[[splenomegaly]]** (enlarged spleen) and hepatomegaly (enlarged liver).
    *   **Darkening of Skin:** This gives the disease its name, **"Kala-azar"** (Black Sickness). It manifests as hyperpigmentation of the face, hands, feet, and abdomen.
    *   **Epidemiological Link:** History of travel to **Bihar**, which is a highly endemic state for Kala-azar in India (along with Jharkhand, West Bengal, and UP).

### Treatment of Kala-azar

The goal of treatment is the elimination of the parasite **[[Leishmania donovani]]** from the body. Treatment protocols follow the guidelines set by the **[[National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme]] (NVBDCP)**.

**Preferred Treatment Regimens (India)**:

| Drug Class | Drug Name | Dosage & Regimen | Remarks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **First Line (Choice)** | **[[Liposomal Amphotericin B]] (LAMB)** | **Single dose** of **10 mg/kg** body weight intravenously. | High efficacy, high safety profile. Used for all age groups including pregnant women. |
| **Oral Therapy** | **[[Miltefosine]]** | Adults (>25 kg): 100 mg daily (50 mg BD) for **28 days**. <br> Children (2-11 yrs): 2.5 mg/kg daily. | Contraindicated in pregnancy and lactating women. |
| **Combination Therapy** | Paromomycin (IM) + Miltefosine (Oral) | Paromomycin (11 mg/kg) + Miltefosine for **10 days**. | Reducing treatment duration helps compliance. |
| **Alternative** | Amphotericin B Deoxycholate | 1 mg/kg IV on alternate days for 15 doses (30 days). | Requires hospitalization; risk of nephrotoxicity. |

**Clinical Relevance:**
*   **PKDL Treatment:** Post-Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) acts as a reservoir. It requires longer treatment, typically **Miltefosine for 12 weeks**.
*   **HIV Co-infection:** Requires careful management, often with higher cumulative doses of LAMB.

### Preventive and Control Measures

Since there is currently no effective vaccine for human use, control relies on breaking the chain of transmission between the **[[Sandfly]]** (*Phlebotomus argentipes*) and the human reservoir.

#### 1. Control of Reservoir (Humans)
In India, Kala-azar is **anthroponotic** (man-to-man transmission), so man is the only reservoir.
*   **Early Diagnosis:** Active and passive case surveillance to detect cases early (using **[[rK39 dipstick test]]**).
*   **Complete Treatment:** Ensuring all patients, including those with PKDL, complete their full course of drugs to reduce the parasite load in the community.

#### 2. Vector Control (Sandfly Control)
*   **Indoor Residual Spraying ([[IRS]]):**
    *   **DDT (50%)** is the insecticide of choice (two rounds per year) sprayed up to 6 feet height on walls.
    *   If the vector becomes resistant to DDT, **Malathion** or **Synthetic Pyrethroids** are used.
*   **Sanitation:**
    *   Eliminate breeding places by filling **cracks and crevices** in walls and floors (sandflies breed in damp, dark, organic soil).
    *   Relocate cattle sheds away from human dwellings (cattle attract sandflies).

#### 3. Personal Prophylaxis
*   **Barriers:** Use of **[[Insecticide Treated Bed Nets]] (ITBN)** or Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs). *Note: Sandflies are very small, so nets must be fine-mesh*.
*   **Habits:** Avoid sleeping on the floor; sleep on cots.
*   **Repellents:** Use of lotions or creams on exposed skin.

### Mnemonic for Control: **"SAND"**

*   **S** - **S**urveillance (Active search for cases/PKDL)
*   **A** - **A**mphotericin B (Single dose treatment)
*   **N** - **N**ets (ITBNs) and **N**o sleeping on floor
*   **D** - **D**DT Spray (Vector control)
