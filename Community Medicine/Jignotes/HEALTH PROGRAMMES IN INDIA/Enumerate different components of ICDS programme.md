# [[HEALTH PROGRAMMES IN INDIA]] > Enumerate different components of ICDS programme

### Components of Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme

The [[Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)]] scheme provides an integrated package of **six services** to ensure a holistic approach towards the development of the child. These services are delivered primarily through the **Anganwadi Centre (AWC)**.

The **six essential components** are:

1.  **Supplementary Nutrition**
2.  **Immunization**
3.  **Health Check-up**
4.  **Referral Services**
5.  **Pre-school Non-formal Education**
6.  **Nutrition and Health Education**

### Beneficiaries and Service Providers Matrix

The concept of ICDS is that the overall impact is much larger if different services are delivered in an integrated manner rather than in isolation.

| Component/Service | Target Group (Beneficiaries) | Service Provided By |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Supplementary Nutrition** | Children < 6 years<br>Pregnant & Lactating Mothers (P&LM)<br>Adolescent Girls (in specific schemes) | [[Anganwadi Worker (AWW)]] & Helper |
| **Immunization** | Children < 6 years<br>Pregnant Women | [[ANM]] / MO (Assisted by AWW) |
| **Health Check-up** | Children < 6 years<br>Pregnant & Lactating Mothers | ANM / MO / AWW |
| **Referral Services** | Children < 6 years<br>Pregnant & Lactating Mothers | AWW / ANM / MO |
| **Pre-school Non-formal Education** | Children **3–6 years** | [[Anganwadi Worker (AWW)]] |
| **Nutrition & Health Education (NHED)** | Women (**15–45 years**)<br>Pregnant & Lactating Mothers | AWW / ANM / MO |

### Detailed Breakdown of Components

#### 1. Supplementary Nutrition
This includes supplementary feeding, growth monitoring, and prophylaxis against Vitamin A deficiency and nutritional anemia. The aim is to bridge the caloric gap between the national recommended intake and the average intake. Support is given for **300 days in a year**.

**Revised Nutritional Norms:**

*   **Children (6–72 months):** 500 kcal energy + 12–15 g protein.
*   **Severely Malnourished Children (6–72 months):** 800 kcal energy + 20–25 g protein.
*   **Pregnant & Lactating Mothers:** 600 kcal energy + 18–20 g protein.

#### 2. Immunization
Vaccination against major vaccine-preventable diseases (TB, Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus, Polio, Hepatitis B, Measles) is carried out for children and pregnant women. The AWW assists the health staff (ANM) in organizing the session and mobilizing the beneficiaries.

#### 3. Health Check-up
This includes:
*   Antenatal care for expectant mothers.
*   Postnatal care for nursing mothers.
*   Care of newborns.
*   [[Growth Monitoring]] and weight recording of children.

#### 4. Referral Services
During health check-ups, if a child or mother is found to be sick, severely malnourished, or "at-risk," they are referred to the Primary Health Centre (PHC) or Community Health Centre (CHC). The AWW is trained to detect disabilities and malnutrition early.

#### 5. Non-formal Pre-school Education (PSE)
Considered the **backbone of ICDS**, this is directed at children aged **3 to 6 years**.
*   **Objective:** To provide a natural, joyful, and stimulating environment for optimal development.
*   **Method:** Play-way method using inexpensive, locally available toys. It is *not* formal schooling (no textbooks).

#### 6. Nutrition and Health Education (NHED)
This is a key element for capacity building of women in the age group of **15–45 years**.
*   **Goal:** To empower women to look after their own health, nutrition, and development needs as well as those of their children.
*   **Strategy:** Delivered through home visits by AWW, special courses, and demonstrations (e.g., cooking demonstrations).

### Mnemonic
To remember the 6 services of ICDS: **"SHINeR"**

*   **S** - **S**upplementary Nutrition
*   **H** - **H**ealth Check-up
*   **I** - **I**mmunization
*   **N** - **N**utrition and Health Education
*   **e** - Pre-school **E**ducation (Non-formal)
*   **R** - **R**eferral Services

### Clinical Relevance
*   **[[Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM)]]:** The ICDS plays a vital role in the early detection of SAM through growth charts at the Anganwadi. AWWs refer these children to **Nutrition Rehabilitation Centres (NRCs)**.
*   **Synergy:** The convergence of health services (immunization/check-ups) with nutritional services reduces the "Double Burden of Malnutrition" and infection susceptibility in the community.
