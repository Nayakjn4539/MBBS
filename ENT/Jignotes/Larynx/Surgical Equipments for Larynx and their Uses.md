# [[Larynx]] > Surgical Equipments for Larynx and their Uses

### **Laryngeal Examination and Diagnostic Instruments**

These instruments are primarily used in the outpatient department (OPD) for the diagnosis of laryngeal pathology.

#### **1. Laryngeal Mirror**
*   **Description:** A plane mirror angled at the end of a straight shaft. Available in sizes ranging from 6 mm to 30 mm diameter.
*   **Uses:** Used for [[Indirect Laryngoscopy]] (IDL) to visualize the base of tongue, valleculae, epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds, arytenoids, ventricular bands, ventricles, true vocal cords, and pyriform fossae.
*   **Technique:** The mirror is warmed (glass side on flame or using spirit lamp) or treated with antifog solution to prevent condensation. The patient sits in the sniffing position, tongue is held with gauze, and the mirror is placed against the uvula/soft palate.
*   **Clinical Implication:** It provides a mirror image (inverted anteroposteriorly). It cannot visualize "hidden areas" like the infrahyoid epiglottis, anterior commissure, and subglottis effectively.

#### **2. Rigid Laryngoscope (Telescope)**
*   **Description:** A rigid rod lens system (Hopkins rod), usually 70° or 90°.
*   **Uses:** Provides a clear, wide-angle, magnified, three-dimensional view of the larynx and laryngopharynx.
*   **Clinical Implication:** It offers better resolution than flexible scopes but causes gagging in sensitive patients. Phonating "Ee" allows assessment of adduction and tension.

#### **3. Flexible Nasopharyngolaryngoscope**
*   **Description:** A flexible fiberoptic bundle passed transnasally.
*   **Uses:**
    *   Examination of patients with a strong gag reflex, trismus, or anatomical abnormalities (short neck).
    *   Assessment of vocal cord movement during **normal speech** and singing (biofeedback).
    *   Evaluation of [[Laryngomalacia]] and vocal cord palsy in infants/neonates.

#### **4. Stroboscope**
*   **Description:** An instrument using synchronized flashing light passed through an endoscope.
*   **Mechanism:** Flashes light at a frequency slightly different from the vocal cord vibration frequency, creating an optical illusion of slow motion.
*   **Uses:** To assess the mucosal wave, glottic closure, and symmetry. Essential for differentiating cysts from polyps and diagnosing early malignancy or scarring.

### **Direct Laryngoscopy and Microlaryngoscopy Instruments**

These are used in the operating room under general anesthesia for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.

> Patient position for Direct Laryngoscopy - "Barking Dog" or "Sniffing the Morning Air" position (Flexion at cervical spine, Extension at atlanto-occipital joint)**.

#### **1. Rigid Direct Laryngoscopes**
*   **Chevalier Jackson Laryngoscope:** U-shaped with **distal illumination**. It has a removable slide to allow insertion of a bronchoscope.
    *   *Disadvantage:* Bulb may get fogged or smeared with secretions.
*   **Negus Laryngoscope:** Wide bore with **proximal illumination** (twin light carrier).
    *   *Advantage:* Broader view, better illumination.
*   **Anterior Commissure Laryngoscope (Holinger):** Has a beveled tip.
    *   *Uses:* To visualize difficult areas like the [[Anterior Commissure]], ventricle, and subglottis. Used for taking biopsy from these areas.
*   **Kleinsasser Operating Laryngoscope:** A self-retaining laryngoscope used for [[Microlaryngoscopy]] (MLS). It is wider to allow binocular vision.

#### **2. Suspension System**
*   **Description:** Consists of a chest piece/support (e.g., Riecker type) or a stand (e.g., Mayo stand).
*   **Uses:** Fixes the laryngoscope in place, freeing both hands of the surgeon for instrumentation.

#### **3. Operating Microscope**
*   **Description:** Usually fitted with a **400 mm** objective lens.
*   **Advantages (Mnemonic: HIM):**
    *   **H**ands-free (Surgeon can use both hands).
    *   **I**llumination (Bright, coaxial light).
    *   **M**agnification (High precision).

#### **4. Microlaryngeal Hand Instruments**
These instruments have long shafts (approx. 22–24 cm) to reach the larynx through the scope.
*   **Forceps:**
    *   *Cup Forceps:* Round or oval, for biopsy.
    *   *Grasping/Alligator Forceps:* For holding tissue or foreign bodies.
    *   *Heart-shaped Forceps:* For grasping vocal cord nodules.
*   **Microlaryngeal Scissors:** For cutting tissues/flaps (e.g., Bellucci scissors).
*   **Sickle Knife:** For making incisions in mucosa (e.g., in Reinke's edema).
*   **Probes/Palpators:** To feel the consistency of lesions or check cricoarytenoid joint mobility.
*   **Suction Tips:** To clear blood/secretions (e.g., Zollner suction).
*   **Injection Needles:** For injecting Teflon, Gelfoam, or steroids into vocal cords.

### **Tracheostomy Instruments**

Instruments required for securing the airway via [[Tracheostomy]].

#### **1. Tracheal Hooks**
*   **Sharp Hook (Cricoid Hook):**
    *   *Use:* To fix and pull up the cricoid cartilage to stabilize the trachea and bring it to a superficial position before incision.
*   **Blunt Hook:**
    *   *Use:* To retract the thyroid isthmus upwards or downwards to expose the tracheal rings.

#### **2. Trousseau’s Tracheal Dilator**
*   **Structure:** Two or three blades that spread out when the handle is approximated. The tip is blunt.
*   **Use:** Inserted into the tracheal incision to spread the cartilages and facilitate the insertion of the tracheostomy tube.
*   *Clinical Note:* A curved hemostat (artery forceps) can be used if a dilator is unavailable.

#### **3. Tracheostomy Tubes**
| Type | Material/Feature | Indications/Uses |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Chevalier Jackson** | Silver/Metal. Double lumen (Inner & Outer tube) | Permanent tracheostomy. Inner tube allows cleaning without removing the whole tube. |
| **Fuller’s** | Metal. Bivalved outer tube | Easier insertion; used for decannulation and phonation. |
| **Portex (Cuffed)** | PVC/Plastic. High volume, low pressure cuff | **Most common.** Prevents aspiration and allows positive pressure ventilation. Prevents air leak. |
| **Portex (Uncuffed)** | PVC/Plastic | Used in children (to prevent subglottic stenosis) or when aspiration risk is gone. |
| **Fenestrated Tube** | Has a hole on the greater curvature | Allows airflow to the larynx for **phonation** (speech) when the opening is blocked. |

### **Advanced and Therapeutic Equipments**

#### **1. Lasers**
*   **CO2 Laser:** The "workhorse" of laryngeal surgery. Used for precise cutting and vaporizing with minimal thermal damage. Delivered via a **micromanipulator** attached to the microscope.
    *   *Uses:* Papillomas, stenosis, early glottic cancer (T1, T2), vocal nodules.
*   **KTP-532 Laser:** Absorbed by hemoglobin. Good for vascular lesions (e.g., hemangiomas).

#### **2. Microdebrider (Laryngeal Skimmer)**
*   **Description:** A powered rotary shaving device with continuous suction.
*   **Uses:** Removal of laryngeal papillomas (Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis) and bulky benign lesions. It removes tissue precisely without thermal injury.

#### **3. Jet Ventilation System**
*   **Use:** Delivers anesthetic gases under high pressure directly into the airway (Venturi effect) without an endotracheal tube.
*   **Clinical Implication:** Essential for laser surgery to provide an unobstructed view and prevent tube ignition.
