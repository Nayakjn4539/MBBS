# Investigation of Strabismus: Tests for Ocular Deviation

The evaluation of ocular deviation is critical for diagnosing [[strabismus]] (squint) and differentiating between latent and manifest deviations. The two primary clinical methods are the corneal reflex tests (objective estimation) and cover tests (definitive diagnosis).

---

## 1. Hirschberg’s Corneal Reflex Test
This is a gross objective test used to estimate the angle of deviation, particularly useful in infants, uncooperative patients, or those with poor fixation where cover tests are difficult.

**Principle:**
It utilizes the position of the [[corneal light reflex]] relative to the pupil center to estimate the deviation.

**Procedure:**
1.  A torchlight is held at a distance of **33 cm to 60 cm** (arm's length) in front of the patient.
2.  The patient is asked to look directly at the light.
3.  The examiner observes the position of the corneal reflection in the deviating eye compared to the fixing eye.

**Interpretation:**
*   **Normal:** The light reflex is slightly nasal to the center of the pupil (due to positive [[Angle Kappa]]).
*   **Mnemonic:** **DOOR** - **D**eviation **O**pposite **O**f **R**eflection.

| Position of Corneal Reflex (Deviating Eye) | Type of Deviation | Estimated Angle (Degrees) | Estimated Prisms (PD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Center of Pupil** | Orthotropia | 0° | 0 PD |
| **Nasal** to Center | Temporal Deviation ([[Exotropia]]) | - | - |
| **Temporal** to Center | Nasal Deviation ([[Esotropia]]) | - | - |
| **Pupillary Margin** | Moderate Deviation | 15° | ~30 PD |
| **Mid-iris region** | Severe Deviation | 30° | ~60 PD |
| **Limbus** | Very Severe Deviation | 45° | ~90 PD |

*Sources:*

> **Clinical Implication:**
> *   **1 mm of deviation** of the corneal reflex corresponds to approximately **7° or 15 Prism Diopters (PD)** of squint.
> *   This test helps differentiate **Pseudostrabismus** (e.g., due to epicanthus) where reflexes are symmetrical, from true [[Strabismus]].

## 2. Krimsky’s Test (Prism Reflex Test)
This is a quantitative modification of the [[Hirschberg test]], used to measure the angle of deviation in patients with poor vision or eccentric fixation.

*   **Modified Krimsky Test:** Prisms are placed in front of the **fixing eye**. The strength of the prism is increased until the corneal reflex in the *deviating* eye is centered.
*   **Standard Krimsky:** Prisms are placed in front of the *deviating* eye.

## 3. Bruckner’s Test
This is a screening procedure for small-angle strabismus and [[anisometropia]], useful in infants.

*   **Procedure:** A direct ophthalmoscope is used to shine light simultaneously into both eyes from a distance of 1 meter.
*   **Finding:**
    *   **Normal:** Equal red reflex in both eyes.
    *   **Strabismus:** The deviating eye has a **brighter/lighter red reflex** compared to the fixing eye.

## 4. Cover Tests
These are the gold standard tests to differentiate between latent squint ([[Heterophoria]]) and manifest squint ([[Heterotropia]]).

**Prerequisites:**
*   Patient must have central fixation.
*   Patient must have sufficient [[visual acuity]] to see the target.
*   Accommodation must be controlled (performed for both distance and near).

**Mnemonic:** **DOOM** - **D**eviation **O**pposite **O**f **M**ovement.

### A. The Cover Test (Direct Cover Test)
**Purpose:** Detects **Manifest Squint ([[Tropia]])**.

**Procedure:**
1.  Ask the patient to fixate on a target.
2.  Cover the *apparently fixing* eye.
3.  Observe the *uncovered* eye for any movement to take up fixation.

**Interpretation:**

| Movement of Uncovered Eye | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Moves Outward** | The eye was deviated Inward $\rightarrow$ [[Esotropia]] |
| **Moves Inward** | The eye was deviated Outward $\rightarrow$ [[Exotropia]] |
| **Moves Down** | The eye was deviated Up $\rightarrow$ [[Hypertropia]] |
| **Moves Up** | The eye was deviated Down $\rightarrow$ [[Hypotropia]] |
| **No Movement** | Orthotropia OR Microtropia (requires 4 Prism Test) |

### B. The Uncover Test
**Purpose:** Detects **Latent Squint ([[Phoria]])**.
*Note: This is performed only if the Direct Cover Test is negative (no manifest squint)*.

**Procedure:**
1.  Cover one eye (this breaks fusion, allowing the covered eye to drift to its resting position).
2.  Remove the cover.
3.  Observe the **eye that was just covered** as it moves to regain binocular fixation.

**Interpretation:**

| Movement of Just-Uncovered Eye | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Moves Outward** (Fusinal divergence) | Eye had drifted In $\rightarrow$ [[Esophoria]] |
| **Moves Inward** (Fusional convergence) | Eye had drifted Out $\rightarrow$ [[Exophoria]] |
| **Slow/Jerky Recovery** | Indicates poor fusional reserves or decompensating phoria |

### C. Alternate Cover Test
**Purpose:**
1.  Reveals the **Total Deviation** (Latent + Manifest).
2.  Differentiates [[Comitant Squint]] from [[Incomitant Squint]] (Paralytic).

**Procedure:**
*   Swiftly move the occluder from one eye to the other repeatedly, preventing the patient from regaining binocular vision.
*   Observe the movement of the eye being uncovered.

**Clinical Implication:**
*   In **Comitant Squint**: The deviation is equal in both eyes (Primary Deviation = Secondary Deviation).
*   In **Paralytic Squint**: The secondary deviation (deviation of the normal eye when the paretic eye fixes) is **greater** than the primary deviation.

## 5. Prism Bar Cover Test (PBCT)
This is the most accurate method to quantify the angle of deviation (both phoria and tropia).

**Principle:**
*   **Neutralization:** Prisms are placed in front of the eye to shift the image onto the fovea.
*   The test is based on the Alternate Cover Test mechanism.

**Procedure:**
1.  Perform the Alternate Cover Test to elicit eye movement.
2.  Place prisms of increasing strength in front of one eye with the **Apex pointing towards the deviation** (Base opposite to deviation).
3.  Continue increasing prism strength until no movement is seen on the alternate cover test (Neutralization point).

**Prism Orientation (Mnemonic: DOCS - Deviation Opposite Cover Prism Base? No, simple logic):**
*   **Esotropia:** Base Out (Apex In).
*   **Exotropia:** Base In (Apex Out).
*   **Hypertropia:** Base Down.
*   **Hypotropia:** Base Up.
