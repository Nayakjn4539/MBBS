# [[Communicable Diseases - Zoonoses]] > Human Monkeypox

### Human Monkeypox

**Human Monkeypox** is a viral [[zoonosis]] (a virus transmitted to humans from animals) with symptoms similar to those seen in the past in smallpox patients, although it is clinically less severe. Following the eradication of [[smallpox]] in 1980 and the cessation of smallpox vaccination, monkeypox has emerged as the most important [[Orthopoxvirus]] for public health.

#### Problem Statement
*    Primarily occurs in central and west Africa, often near tropical rainforests, but is increasingly appearing in urban areas.
*   **Global Spread:** Outbreaks have occurred outside Africa, linked to international travel or imported animals (e.g., USA 2003 linked to prairie dogs, UK, Israel, Singapore).
*   In May 2022, multiple cases were identified in several non-endemic countries.

### Epidemiological Determinants

**1. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** [[Monkeypox virus]].
*   **Type:** Enveloped double-stranded DNA virus.
*   **Genus:** *Orthopoxvirus*; **Family:** *Poxviridae*.
*   **Clades:** There are two distinct genetic clades:
    1.  **Central African (Congo Basin) clade:** Historically causes more severe disease and thought to be more transmissible.
    2.  **West African clade**.

**2. Natural Host/Reservoir**
*   Various animal species are susceptible, including rope squirrels, tree squirrels, [[Gambian pouched rats]], dormice, and non-human primates.
*   The exact reservoir is not fully identified, but rodents are the likely candidates.

### Mode of Transmission

**A. Animal-to-Human (Zoonotic)**
*   **Direct Contact:** Contact with blood, bodily fluids, or cutaneous/mucosal lesions of infected animals.
*   **Ingestion:** Eating inadequately cooked meat (bushmeat) and other animal products of infected animals.

**B. Human-to-Human**
*   **Respiratory:** Close contact with respiratory secretions (droplets). Usually requires prolonged face-to-face contact.
*   **Contact:** Direct contact with skin lesions of an infected person or recently contaminated objects ([[fomites]]).
*   **Vertical:** Via the placenta from mother to fetus (congenital monkeypox).
*   **Sexual:** While close physical contact is a risk, studies are ongoing regarding specific sexual transmission routes.

### Incubation Period
*   Usually **6 to 13 days** but can range from **5 to 21 days**.

### Clinical Picture
The infection is divided into two periods:

**1. Invasion Period (0–5 Days)**
*   Characterized by fever, intense headache, back pain, [[myalgia]] (muscle aches), and intense asthenia (lack of energy).
*   **Distinctive Feature:** [[Lymphadenopathy]] (swelling of lymph nodes) is a key feature that distinguishes monkeypox from [[chickenpox]], [[measles]], and smallpox.

**2. Skin Eruption Phase (Within 1–3 days of fever)**
*   **Distribution:** Concentrated on the **face (95%)** and extremities (palms of hands and soles of feet in 75% cases) rather than the trunk. Also affects oral mucous membranes (70%), genitalia (30%), and conjunctivae (20%).
*   **Evolution of Rash:**
    1.  **Macules** (lesions with a flat base)
    2.  **Papules** (slightly raised firm lesions)
    3.  **Vesicles** (lesions filled with clear fluid)
    4.  **Pustules** (lesions filled with yellowish fluid)
    5.  **Crusts** (dry up and fall off).

**Outcome:** Usually a self-limited disease lasting 2 to 4 weeks. Severe cases occur more commonly in children. The [[Case Fatality Rate]] (CFR) has been around 3–6%.

**Complications:** Secondary infections, bronchopneumonia, sepsis, encephalitis, and infection of the cornea leading to vision loss.

### Diagnosis
*   **Test of Choice:** [[Polymerase Chain Reaction]] (PCR) is preferred due to accuracy and sensitivity.
*   **Samples:** Optimal samples are from skin lesions—the roof or fluid from vesicles and pustules, and dry crusts.

### Treatment
*   **Supportive Care:** Optimized to alleviate symptoms, manage complications, and maintain nutritional status (fluids and food).
*   **Antivirals:** An antiviral agent, [[Tecovirimat]], developed for smallpox, was licensed by the European Medical Association (EMA) for monkeypox in 2022.

### Prevention and Vaccination

**1. Vaccination**
*   **Smallpox Vaccine:** Vaccination against smallpox was about **85% effective** in preventing monkeypox. Prior smallpox vaccination may result in milder illness.
*   **Newer Vaccine:** A vaccine based on a modified attenuated vaccinia virus (Ankara strain) was approved for monkeypox prevention in 2019. It is a two-dose vaccine.

**2. Reducing Human-to-Human Transmission**
*   **Surveillance:** Rapid identification of new cases.
*   **Isolation:** Avoid close contact with infected persons.
*   **Healthcare Precautions:** Health workers caring for suspected/confirmed cases should implement standard infection control precautions. If possible, persons previously vaccinated against smallpox should care for the patient.

### Clinical Relevance & Mnemonic
**Mnemonic for Symptoms:** **MONKEY**
*   **M**uscle aches (Myalgia)
*   **O**nset of Fever
*   **N**odes swollen (**Lymphadenopathy** – *The key differentiator from Smallpox*)
*   **K**utaneous (Cutaneous) rash (Face -> Extremities)
*   **E**xhaustion (Asthenia)
*   **Y**ears (Children are more susceptible to severe disease)
