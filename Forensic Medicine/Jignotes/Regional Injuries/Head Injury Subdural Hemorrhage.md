# [[Regional Injuries]] > Head Injury Subdural Hemorrhage

### Subdural Hemorrhage (SDH)

**Definition**
Subdural hemorrhage (SDH) is the collection of blood in the potential space between the **dura mater** and the **arachnoid mater** [[meninges]]. It is essentially a venous or capillary bleeding, unlike Extradural Hemorrhage (EDH) which is arterial.

### Anatomy and Mechanism
*   **Source of Bleeding:**
    *   Most commonly due to the rupture of **[[bridging veins]]** (communicating veins) that pass from the cerebral cortex across the subdural space to drain into the superior sagittal sinus.
    *   Can also occur from torn cortical veins, dural venous sinuses, or lacerations of the brain.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **Shear Strain:** It usually results from rotational acceleration or deceleration injuries.
    *   The brain can move slightly within the skull, but the venous sinuses are fixed to the skull. This differential movement stretches and tears the tethered bridging veins.
    *   Can occur with or without skull fractures.

### Classification
SDH is classified based on the time interval between injury and the appearance of clinical signs.

| Type | Duration | Pathophysiology & Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Acute SDH** | Within 3 days (usually < 24 hours) | • Caused by rupture of large bridging veins or lacerations.<br>• Blood is fluid or semi-fluid/clotted.<br>• High mortality due to rapid brain compression. |
| **Subacute SDH** | 3 days to 3 weeks | • Blood is partly clotted and partly fluid (due to hemolysis/dilution with CSF).<br>• Associated with minor cerebral contusions. |
| **Chronic SDH** | > 3 weeks | • Encapsulated liquid clot (dark brown fluid).<br>• Known as *Pachymeningitis hemorrhagica interna chronica*.<br>• Common in elderly and alcoholics due to brain atrophy stretching the veins. |

### Predisposing Factors (Risk Factors)
**Mnemonic: ABC**
*   **A**ged / **A**lcoholics: Brain atrophy increases the subdural space, stretching the bridging veins, making them prone to rupture even with trivial trauma.
*   **B**oxers: Repeated blows cause chronic SDH (Dementia Pugilistica).
*   **C**hild Abuse: Shaken Baby Syndrome involves SDH due to violent shaking.

### Clinical Features
*   **Onset:** Symptoms may appear slowly compared to EDH.
*   **Lucid Interval:** Can occur in SDH but is less well-defined than in EDH.
*   **Symptoms:** Headache, drowsiness, confusion, contralateral hemiparesis.
*   **Pupils:** Dilated pupil on the side of the hemorrhage (due to uncal herniation compressing the oculomotor nerve).
*   **False Localizing Sign:** Kernohan’s notch phenomenon may cause ipsilateral hemiparesis.

### Diagnosis (Radiology)
*   **CT Scan:**
    *   Appears as a **Crescentic** or **Concavo-convex** hyperdense opacity.
    *   **Mnemonic:** **C**rescentic = **C**hronic/Subdural; **B**iconvex = **B**reak in Bone (Epidural).
    *   It **crosses the suture lines** (unlike EDH) but is limited by dural reflections (falx cerebri and tentorium).

### Autopsy Findings
*   **Appearance:**
    *   **Acute:** A layer of dark red or purple blood clot over the cerebral hemisphere. It molds to the surface of the brain (undulating appearance) but does not flatten the gyri as sharply as EDH.
    *   **Chronic:** Encapsulated by a neomembrane. The contents eventually liquefy into a chocolate-colored fluid.
*   **Water Test:** **Subdural hemorrhage can be washed away** with running water, whereas [[Subarachnoid Hemorrhage]] (SAH) cannot be washed off (as it is under the arachnoid membrane).
*   **Pressure Effects:**
    *   Flattening of cerebral convolutions below the clot.
    *   Midline shift and herniation (subfalcine or transtentorial).
*   **Dating of SDH:**
    *   Useful for medicolegal correlation of the time of assault.
    *   **1–4 days:** Clotted, dark red.
    *   **5–10 days:** Brownish color.
    *   **2–3 weeks:** Discrete membrane visible.
    *   **> 1 month:** Firm capsule with watery fluid.

### Differences: SDH vs EDH

| Feature | Extradural Hemorrhage (EDH) | Subdural Hemorrhage (SDH) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Location** | Between Skull and Dura | Between Dura and Arachnoid |
| **Source** | Arterial ([[Middle Meningeal Artery]]) | Venous ([[Bridging Veins]]) |
| **CT Shape** | Biconvex / Lens-shaped | Crescent / Banana-shaped |
| **Suture Lines** | Limited by sutures (Does not cross) | Crosses suture lines |
| **Lucid Interval** | Classic / Well-defined | Less distinct / Absent |
| **Associated Fracture** | Common (Temporal bone) | Less common |

### Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Nature:** Usually **Accidental** (falls) or **Homicidal** (assaults). Suicidal is rare.
*   **Trivial Trauma:** In alcoholics and the elderly, fatal SDH can occur from minor falls or impacts that might be overlooked or forgotten (e.g., bumping head against a door).
*   **"Acute on Chronic":** Re-bleeding into an old encapsulated SDH can be triggered by minor fresh trauma, leading to death. The autopsy surgeon must distinguish the fresh bleed from the old lesion.
*   **Child Abuse:** SDH in an infant without a history of significant trauma is highly suspicious of [[Non-accidental injury]] (Shaken Baby Syndrome).
*   **Artefacts:** Care must be taken not to create artefactual SDH during skull cap removal at autopsy.
