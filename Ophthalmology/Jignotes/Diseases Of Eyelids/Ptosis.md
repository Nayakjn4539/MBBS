# Ptosis: Classification and Evaluation

**Definition**: [[Ptosis]] (Blepharoptosis) is the abnormal drooping of the [[upper eyelid]] in relation to the globe.
*   **Normal Position**: The upper lid covers about the upper one-sixth of the [[cornea]] (approximately 2 mm).
*   **Ptosis**: The upper lid covers more than 2 mm of the cornea.

### Classification of Ptosis

Ptosis is broadly classified based on **etiology** or **onset** (Congenital vs. Acquired).

#### 1. Etiological Classification
| Type | Pathophysiology | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Neurogenic** | Innervational defects to [[Levator Palpebrae Superioris]] (LPS) or [[Muller's muscle]]. | • [[Third nerve palsy]] (Oculomotor)<br>• [[Horner's syndrome]] (Oculosympathetic paresis)<br>• [[Marcus Gunn jaw-winking syndrome]] (Synkinetic)<br>• [[Ophthalmoplegic migraine]] |
| **Myogenic** | Acquired or congenital disorder of the LPS muscle or myoneural junction. | • [[Myasthenia gravis]]<br>• [[Myotonic dystrophy]]<br>• [[Ocular myopathy]]<br>• [[Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia]] (CPEO) |
| **Aponeurotic** | Defects/dehiscence/disinsertion of the [[levator aponeurosis]] with a normal functioning muscle. | • **Involutional (Senile) Ptosis** (Most common)<br>• Post-operative (e.g., after cataract surgery)<br>• Traumatic dehiscence |
| **Mechanical** | Excessive weight on the upper lid pulling it down. | • [[Chalazion]]<br>• Eyelid tumors<br>• Lid edema<br>• [[Cicatricial ptosis]] (Trachoma, Pemphigoid) |

#### 2. Clinical Classification (Onset)

**A. Congenital Ptosis**
*   Usually due to developmental dystrophy of the [[levator muscle]].
*   **Key Feature**: **Lid Lag on Downgaze**. The ptotic lid remains higher than the normal lid when looking down due to the tethering effect of the fibrotic/dystrophic muscle (poor relaxation).
*   **Subtypes**:
    1.  **Simple Congenital Ptosis**: Not associated with other anomalies.
    2.  **With Superior Rectus Weakness**: Due to common embryological origin.
    3.  **[[Blepharophimosis syndrome]]**: Autosomal dominant tetrad of:
        *   Ptosis
        *   [[Blepharophimosis]] (horizontal narrowing of palpebral fissure)
        *   [[Telecanthus]]
        *   [[Epicanthus inversus]].
    4.  **Synkinetic Ptosis (Marcus Gunn Jaw-Winking)**: Retraction of ptotic lid with jaw movements (stimulation of ipsilateral [[pterygoid muscle]]). Due to trigemino-oculomotor synkinesis.

**B. Acquired Ptosis**
*   Neurogenic, myogenic, aponeurotic, or mechanical causes occurring later in life.
*   **Key Feature**: In downgaze, the ptotic lid is *lower* than the normal lid.

### Pseudoptosis
Conditions where the eye *appears* ptotic but there is no actual pathology of the lifting mechanism.
*   **Causes**:
    *   [[Microphthalmos]] / [[Phthisis bulbi]] / [[Enophthalmos]] (Lack of posterior support).
    *   Contralateral [[lid retraction]] (Normal eye looks too wide, making the other look ptotic).
    *   [[Hypotropia]] (Eye looks down, lid follows).
    *   [[Dermatochalasis]] (Excessive skin overhang).
    *   [[Brow ptosis]].

### Clinical Evaluation

#### 1. History
*   **Onset**: Congenital (since birth) vs. Acquired.
*   **Variability**: Worsens towards evening (suggests [[Myasthenia gravis]]).
*   **Trauma/Surgery**: History of cataract surgery or trauma.
*   **Family History**: Myopathies or Blepharophimosis.

#### 2. Inspection & General Examination
*   **Head Posture**: Chin elevation (to see through lower visual field).
*   **Frontalis Overaction**: Wrinkling of forehead (compensatory mechanism).
*   **Lid Crease**:
    *   **Absent/Faint**: Congenital ptosis.
    *   **High**: Aponeurotic ptosis (dehiscence).
*   **Bell's Phenomenon**: Upward rolling of the eye on closure. *Crucial to check before surgery to prevent exposure keratopathy*.
*   **Jaw Winking**: Ask patient to open mouth/move jaw side-to-side.

#### 3. Ocular Measurements (Crucial for Grading & Surgery)

**A. Palpebral Fissure Height (PFH) / Vertical Fissure Height**
*   Distance between upper and lower lid margins at the center.
*   **Normal**:
    *   Males: 7–10 mm
    *   Females: 8–12 mm.
*   **Grading of Ptosis (based on difference between eyes or amount of cornea covered)**:
    *   **Mild**: 2 mm
    *   **Moderate**: 3 mm
    *   **Severe**: ≥ 4 mm.

**B. Marginal Reflex Distance 1 (MRD-1)**
*   Distance between the upper lid margin and the central [[corneal light reflex]] in primary gaze.
*   **Normal**: 4–4.5 mm.

**C. Levator Function Test (Upper Lid Excursion - ULE)**
*   **Method (Burke's Method)**: Place thumb firmly against the eyebrow (to block [[frontalis muscle]] action). Ask patient to look down, then look up. Measure the excursion of the upper lid margin.
*   **Grading**:
    | Excursion (mm) | Grading |
    | :--- | :--- |
    | **≥ 15 mm** | Normal |
    | **≥ 8 mm** | Good |
    | **5 – 7 mm** | Fair |
    | **≤ 4 mm** | Poor |
    *(Source:)*

**D. Upper Lid Crease Position**
*   Vertical distance from lid margin to the lid crease in downgaze.
*   **Normal**: Males ~8 mm; Females ~10 mm.

### Special Investigations

1.  **Tensilon Test (Edrophonium Test)**:
    *   Used for [[Myasthenia gravis]].
    *   Injection of Edrophonium leads to temporary improvement of ptosis.
2.  **Ice Pack Test**:
    *   For Myasthenia gravis. Ice pack applied for 2-5 minutes improves ptosis (cold inhibits acetylcholinesterase).
3.  **Phenylephrine Test**:
    *   Instill 10% Phenylephrine. If ptosis improves, it confirms [[Muller's muscle]] function (useful for Horner's syndrome and planning Fasanella-Servat surgery).
4.  **Cocaine Test (4%) / Apraclonidine Test**:
    *   Confirmatory tests for [[Horner's Syndrome]].

### Management

Treatment depends on the **degree of ptosis** and **levator function**.

> Flowchart linking Ptosis Severity + Levator Function to Surgical Choice

#### Surgical Approaches based on Evaluation

| Ptosis Severity | Levator Function | Recommended Surgery |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mild (1.5-2 mm)** | **Good** (>8 mm) | **[[Fasanella-Servat Operation]]**<br>(Tarso-conjunctivo-Mullerectomy) |
| **Moderate (3 mm)** | **Fair to Good** (5+ mm) | **[[Levator Resection]]**<br>(Strengthening the muscle) |
| **Severe (≥4 mm)** | **Poor** (<4 mm) | **[[Frontalis Sling Operation]]**<br>(Brow suspension using fascia lata or silicone rod) |

**Specific Scenarios:**
*   **Marcus Gunn Jaw Winking**: LPS excision combined with Frontalis Sling.
*   **Aponeurotic Ptosis**: Aponeurosis strengthening/repair.
*   **Myasthenia Gravis**: Medical management (anticholinesterases, steroids, thymectomy).

**Clinical Implication**: In congenital ptosis, if visual axis is occluded causing [[stimulus deprivation amblyopia]], surgery is performed **immediately/early**. If not, surgery is typically delayed until age 3-5 years for accurate measurements.
