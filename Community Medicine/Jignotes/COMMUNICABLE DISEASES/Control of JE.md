# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Control of JE

### **Control of Japanese Encephalitis (JE)**

Control of [[Japanese Encephalitis]] is challenging because the vector mosquitoes are outdoor resters (exophilic) and scatter widely, making them difficult to target,. Therefore, a multipronged strategy involving vaccination, vector control, and reservoir management is required.

The control measures are classified into:

### 1. Vaccination (The Most Effective Measure)
Immunization of the population at risk is the primary strategy for prevention.

**A. Human Vaccination (Under [[Universal Immunization Programme]])**
Currently, the live attenuated vaccine is widely used in endemic districts in India.

| Feature | **Live Attenuated Vaccine** | **Killed/Inactivated Vaccine** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strain** | **[[SA 14-14-2]]** | Mouse-brain derived (Nakayama) or Cell culture (Kolar strain/JENVAC), |
| **Type** | Cell culture derived, Live | Inactivated |
| **Dose** | **0.5 ml** | 0.5 ml (children <3 yrs), 1.0 ml (>3 yrs) |
| **Route** | **Subcutaneous (SC)** | Intramuscular (IM) |
| **Site** | **[[Left Upper Arm]]** | Anterolateral thigh |
| **Schedule** | **2 Doses:** <br>1. At **9 months** (with Measles-Rubella)<br>2. At **16-24 months** (with DPT booster), | Primary: 2 doses (4 weeks apart)<br>Booster: After 1 year, then every 3 years |
| **Efficacy** | High seroconversion, long-term protection | Limited duration, requires multiple boosters |

*   **Adult Vaccination:** Recommended in high-burden districts for age group 15–65 years.
*   **Contraindications:** Pregnancy, lactation, and symptomatic HIV.

**B. Pig Vaccination**
*   Pigs act as **[[Amplifier Hosts]]** (they circulate high viral loads without dying, infecting mosquitoes),.
*   Vaccinating pigs eliminates their role as amplifiers.
*   *Limitation:* Difficult to sustain because the pig population turnover (slaughter/birth) is very rapid.

### 2. Vector Control
The primary vectors are **[[Culex tritaeniorhynchus]]** and *Culex vishnui* group. Since they breed in rice fields and bite outdoors, control is complex.

*   **Fogging:** Aerial or ground fogging with **[[Ultra Low Volume (ULV)]]** insecticides (e.g., Malathion, Fenitrothion) is used to control epidemics,.
*   **Indoor Residual Spray (IRS):** Generally **not effective** because the vector is exophilic (rests outdoors). However, spraying is done in pigsties, animal shelters, and vegetation around houses in affected villages,.
*   **Larval Control:** Use of larvivorous fish or biocides in paddy fields (often impractical due to the scale of agriculture).
*   **Personal Protection:**
    *   Use of **[[Insecticide Treated Bed Nets]]** (ITBNs).
    *   Wearing full-sleeve clothing to minimize skin exposure.
    *   Use of repellents.

### 3. Reservoir (Pig) Management
Interventions targeting the amplifier host are crucial to break the transmission chain.

*   **Segregation:** Pigs should be kept away from human dwellings.
*   **Pigsties:** Keep pigs in distinct enclosures (pigsties), especially during **dusk to dawn** (peak biting time of the vector).
*   **Mosquito Nets for Pigs:** Using nets over pigsties can reduce transmission from mosquito to pig.

### 4. Case Management (AES Guidelines)
There is **no specific antiviral treatment** for JE. Management is supportive and symptomatic, focused on the **[[Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES)]]** protocol,.

**Goals of Management:**
1.  **Control Convulsions:** Use anticonvulsants (Diazepam/Phenytoin).
2.  **Reduce Intracranial Pressure:** Use Mannitol if signs of raised ICT are present.
3.  **Airway Management:** Suction, oxygen, or intubation if respiratory failure occurs.
4.  **Fluid Balance:** Maintain hydration but avoid fluid overload.
5.  **Referral:** Early referral to tertiary centers if danger signs (shock, poor respiratory effort) appear.

**> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Algorithm for Management of AES/JE including fluid therapy and danger signs is essential here.**

### 5. Surveillance
*   **Sentinel Surveillance:** Established in endemic districts for early diagnosis (IgM Capture ELISA).
*   **Vector Surveillance:** Monitoring density of *Culex* mosquitoes.

### 💡 Mnemonic for Control
**"JE PIGS"**

*   **J**ab the humans (Vaccination SA 14-14-2)
*   **E**liminate vectors (ULV Fogging/Malathion)
*   **P**rotect from bites (Bed nets/Clothing)
*   **I**solate the **P**igs (Amplifier host segregation)
*   **G**ive supportive care (Manitol/Diazepam)
*   **S**entinel Surveillance

### 🏥 Clinical Relevance
JE has a high **Case Fatality Rate (20–40%)**. Even among survivors, nearly 30-50% suffer from permanent **neurological sequelae** (mental retardation, paralysis, seizures). Therefore, **prevention (Vaccination)** is far superior to cure. Diagnosis is confirmed by **IgM Capture ELISA** in CSF or blood.
