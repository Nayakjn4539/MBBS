# Restrictive Squint (Incomitant Strabismus)

Restrictive squint is a type of **incomitant strabismus** where the movement of the eye is limited due to mechanical restriction of the [[extraocular muscles]] or their surrounding tissues, rather than paralysis of the nerve supply. The ocular deviation varies in different directions of gaze.

### Key Characteristics
*   **Limitation of Movement:** Movement is restricted in the field of action of the affected muscle.
*   **Ocular Deviation:** The angle of deviation is not constant. In the primary position, the deviation is often smaller in proportion to the limitation of movement compared to paralytic squint.
*   **Forced Duction Test (FDT):** This is the hallmark diagnostic test. It is **Positive** (resistance is felt when moving the eye passively), distinguishing it from paralytic squint where FDT is negative.

## 1. Duane's Retraction Syndrome (DRS)

**Definition:** A congenital ocular motility defect, now classified as a **Congenital Cranial Dysinnervation Disorder (CCDD)**. It is characterized by paradoxical innervation of the [[lateral rectus]] or [[medial rectus]] muscles.

**Etiology and Pathogenesis:**
*   **Paradoxical Innervation:** The [[abducens nerve]] (CN VI) nucleus or nerve is hypoplastic or absent. The [[lateral rectus]] is aberrantly innervated by branches from the [[oculomotor nerve]] (CN III).
*   **Co-contraction:** When the patient attempts **adduction** (an action controlled by CN III), the lateral rectus (also receiving CN III signals) contracts simultaneously with the medial rectus.
*   **Globe Retraction:** This co-contraction of opposing horizontal recti pulls the globe backward into the orbit.

**Clinical Features:**
*   **Retraction of the Globe:** Occurs on attempted **adduction**.
*   **Palpebral Fissure Changes:**
    *   **Narrowing** of the palpebral fissure on adduction (due to globe retraction).
    *   **Widening** of the palpebral fissure on abduction.
*   **Motility Defects:** Limitation of abduction, adduction, or both (depending on the type).
*   **Upshoot or Downshoot:** The eye may shoot up or down in adduction (leash phenomenon).
*   **Primary Position:** The eye may be orthotropic (straight), esotropic, or exotropic.

### Classification (Huber’s Classification)

| Type | Motility Defect | Primary Position | EMG Findings | Frequency |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type I** | Marked limitation of **Abduction**. Normal or slightly limited adduction. | Usually Esotropia or Orthophoria | LR does not fire on abduction but fires paradoxically on adduction. | Most Common (60%) |
| **Type II** | Limitation of **Adduction**. Normal or slightly limited abduction. | Usually Exotropia or Orthophoria | LR fires on abduction and *also* on adduction. | Least Common |
| **Type III** | Limitation of **Both** Abduction and Adduction. | Usually Orthophoria | LR and MR co-contract simultaneously. | Rare |

**Mnemonics for DRS Types:**
*   Type **1**: **1** D (**A**bduction limited)
*   Type **2**: **2** D's (**Add**uction limited)
*   Type **3**: **3** D's (**Ab**duction and **Add**uction limited)

**Management:**
*   **Conservative:** If eyes are straight in primary position and there is no abnormal head posture (AHP).
*   **Indications for Surgery:**
    *   Significant deviation in primary position.
    *   Noticeable abnormal head posture (face turn).
    *   Severe retraction or upshoot/downshoot.
*   **Surgical Options:** Recession of the medial rectus (for esotropia) or lateral rectus (for exotropia). Faden operation may be used.

## 2. Brown's Superior Oblique Tendon Sheath Syndrome

**Definition:** A congenital motility defect caused by mechanical restriction of the [[superior oblique]] tendon, preventing it from passing freely through the [[trochlea]].

**Etiology:**
*   **Congenital:** Short, inelastic, or tight superior oblique tendon/sheath.
*   **Acquired:** Trauma, inflammation (rheumatoid arthritis), or surgery affecting the trochlear region.

**Pathogenesis:** The tight tendon acts like a tether. It restricts the eye from moving up, specifically when the eye is adducted (where the SO tendon is maximally stretched).

**Clinical Features:**
*   **Limitation of Elevation in Adduction:** This is the hallmark sign. The eye cannot look up when turned inward.
*   **Normal Elevation in Abduction:** The eye elevates normally when looking out.
*   **Primary Position:** Eyes are usually straight (orthotropic) or may show hypotropia.
*   **Positive Forced Duction Test:** Resistance is felt when the examiner attempts to elevate the eye in adduction (confirms mechanical restriction).
*   **V-Pattern:** Often associated with V-pattern divergence.
*   **Clicking Sensation:** Sometimes felt/heard upon ocular movement in acquired cases.

**Differential Diagnosis:**
*   **Inferior Oblique Palsy:** Also causes limited elevation in adduction. However, FDT is negative in IO palsy, and there is usually an overaction of the superior oblique (A-pattern). In Brown's, the superior oblique action is mechanically restricted but not overacting in function.

| Feature | Brown's Syndrome | Inferior Oblique Palsy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pathology** | Mechanical (Restriction) | Neurological (Paralysis) |
| **Forced Duction Test** | **Positive** (Cannot elevate) | **Negative** (Eye moves freely) |
| **Elevation in Adduction** | Absent/Restricted | Absent/Restricted |
| **Pattern** | V-Pattern | A-Pattern |
| **Head Posture** | Chin up | Head tilt |

**Management:**
*   **Conservative:** Observation is preferred if the patient is asymptomatic with no head posture. Spontaneous improvement can occur.
*   **Surgery:** Indicated for significant hypotropia or abnormal head posture.
    *   **Procedure:** Superior oblique tenotomy (cutting the tendon) or silicon expander insertion to lengthen the tendon.

## 3. Other Forms of Restrictive Strabismus

### Strabismus Fixus
*   **Definition:** A rare condition where one or both eyes are fixed in a specific position (usually convergent/esotropia) due to severe fibrous tightening of the extraocular muscles (usually [[medial rectus]]).
*   **Features:** The eye is "fixed" and cannot be moved, even with forceps (extremely positive FDT).
*   **Treatment:** Surgical release of the tight muscles.

### Thyroid Ophthalmopathy (Graves' Disease)
*   **Mechanism:** Infiltration of muscles by inflammatory cells and fibrosis.
*   **Muscles Involved:** **I**'m **S**low **L**earner (Order of frequency: **I**nferior Rectus $\rightarrow$ **M**edial Rectus $\rightarrow$ **S**uperior Rectus $\rightarrow$ **L**ateral Rectus).
*   **Result:** Fibrosis of the inferior rectus causes restriction of elevation (looks like a double elevator palsy or superior rectus palsy, but FDT is positive).

### Congenital Fibrosis of Extraocular Muscles (CFEOM)
*   **Definition:** Hereditary congenital cranial dysinnervation disorder where muscles are replaced by fibrous tissue.
*   **Features:** Severe restriction of motility, ptosis, and chin-up head position.

## Clinical Assessment: Forced Duction Test (FDT)

This is the most critical test to differentiate Restrictive from Paralytic squint.

1.  **Anesthesia:** Topical anesthetic drops are applied.
2.  **Technique:** The conjunctiva near the limbus is grasped with toothed forceps. The examiner attempts to move the eye in the direction of the limitation.
3.  **Interpretation:**
    *   **Positive FDT:** The eye **cannot** be moved mechanically. This confirms **Restrictive Squint** (e.g., Brown's, Thyroid, Entrapment).
    *   **Negative FDT:** The eye **can** be moved freely. This confirms **Paralytic Squint** (nerve palsy).
