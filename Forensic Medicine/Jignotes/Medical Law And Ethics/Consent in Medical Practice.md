# [[Medical Law And Ethics]] > Consent in Medical Practice

### Definition
**Consent** is defined as voluntary agreement, compliance, or permission. In legal terms, specifically under **Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act**, two or more persons are said to consent when they agree upon the same thing in the same sense (*Consensus ad idem* or meeting of minds) [[Consent]].

To examine, treat, or operate on a patient without consent is technically an **Assault (Battery)** in law, even if the act is beneficial and done in good faith.

### Types of Consent

#### 1. Implied Consent
*   **Definition:** Consent is not stated in words but is inferred from the patient's conduct or the circumstances.
*   **Example:** A patient entering a doctor's chamber, standing in a queue for OP, or extending their arm for a BP check or injection.
*   **Scope:** Valid only for routine clinical examinations (inspection, palpation, percussion, auscultation) and minor procedures. It **does not** cover intimate examinations (vaginal/rectal) or invasive procedures.

#### 2. Expressed Consent
This is specific permission given by the patient. It is required for anything beyond routine examination.
*   **Oral/Verbal Consent:** Stated by word of mouth. Suitable for minor procedures (e.g., drawing blood, giving an injection). It should ideally be obtained in the presence of a disinterested third party (nurse/attendant).
*   **Written Consent:** The **Gold Standard** for medicolegal defense. It is **mandatory** for:
    *   Major surgical operations.
    *   Procedures requiring anesthesia.
    *   Complex diagnostic procedures (e.g., angiography).
    *   Use of contrast media.
    *   Medicolegal examinations.

#### 3. Informed Consent (Doctrine of Full Disclosure)
This is the cornerstone of modern medical practice. It is not just a signature on a form but a *process* of communication. The doctor must disclose the following to the patient before obtaining consent:
1.  **N**ature of the illness/condition.
2.  **N**ature of the proposed treatment/procedure.
3.  **A**lternative treatments available.
4.  **R**isks and benefits of the proposed treatment.
5.  **R**isks of *refusing* the treatment (Informed Refusal).
6.  **P**rognosis.

> *   **R**isks of refusal

#### 4. Proxy / Substitute Consent
Used when the patient is incompetent to give consent (minors, insane, unconscious). Consent is obtained from the parent, legal guardian, or next of kin.

### Ingredients of Valid Consent (Section 90 IPC)
For consent to be legally valid in India, it must fulfill specific criteria laid down under **Section 90 of the [[Indian Penal Code]] (IPC)**. A consent is **NOT VALID** if:
1.  **Fear of Injury:** Given by a person under fear of injury or intimidation.
2.  **Misconception of Fact:** Given by a person under a misconception of fact (e.g., fraud, misrepresentation), and the doctor knows this.
3.  **Insanity:** Given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, cannot understand the nature and consequence of the act.
4.  **Intoxication:** Given by a person under the influence of alcohol/drugs unable to understand the consequences.
5.  **Age:** Given by a child under **12 years** of age.

> **Note:** While Sec 90 IPC implies a child >12 years can consent to general harm, for **medical procedures involving risk (surgery/anesthesia)**, the valid age for consent is **18 years** (Section 87 IPC).

### Medicolegal Hierarchy of Consent (IPC Sections)

| IPC Section | Provision | Mnemonics/Key Point |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Section 87** | Consent given by a person **above 18 years** to suffer harm not intended to cause death/grievous hurt is a valid defense. | **Adult Consent** (Surgery) |
| **Section 88** | Act done in **good faith** for the **benefit** of the person with consent (even if it causes harm). Protects surgeons taking calculated risks. | **Surgeon's Shield** |
| **Section 89** | Consent from **guardian/parent** for persons under 12 years or of unsound mind, for their benefit. | **Guardian's Consent** |
| **Section 90** | Defines **Invalid Consent** (Fear, Fraud, Insanity, Intoxication, Child <12). | **Negative List** |
| **Section 91** | Consent does not cover acts that are offences independently of harm caused (e.g., Criminal Abortion). | **Illegal Acts** |
| **Section 92** | Acts done in good faith for benefit **without consent** when it is impossible to obtain it (Emergency). | **Emergency Doctrine** |

### Doctrine of Locoparentis
*   **Definition:** "In the place of a parent."
*   **Scenario:** In an emergency involving a child (e.g., in a boarding school or camp) where parents are unavailable, the person in charge (Headmaster, Warden, Teacher) can give consent for urgent medical treatment.

### Doctrine of Therapeutic Privilege
*   **Definition:** An exception to the rule of "Full Disclosure."
*   **Scenario:** If the doctor believes that disclosing full details (e.g., a grim diagnosis or remote risks) would psychologically harm the patient or hinder rational decision-making (e.g., in extreme anxiety or depression), they may withhold some information.
*   **Condition:** The full details *must* be disclosed to the next of kin/legal guardian.

### Consent in Specific Scenarios

| Situation | Consent Requirement | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Medical Examination** | Oral/Implied (minor), Written (major) | Refusal is a right. |
| **Operation/Anesthesia** | **Written Informed Consent** | Mandatory from patient >18 yrs. Spouse consent NOT legally required but advisable for sterilization. |
| **Emergency** | **Not Required** (Sec 92 IPC) | Proceed to save life/limb. |
| **Minor (<18 yrs)** | Parents / Guardian | In emergency, Loco Parentis applies. |
| **Accused (Criminal)** | **Not Required** (Sec 53 CrPC) | Police (Sub-Inspector+) can request examination; reasonable force allowed. |
| **Victim (Rape)** | **Mandatory Written Consent** | Cannot be examined without consent (even by court order). |
| **Intoxicated Person** | Invalid | Wait for sobriety or take guardian consent. |
| **[[Medicolegal Autopsy]]** | **Not Required** | Ordered by Police/Magistrate. |
| **Pathological Autopsy** | **Mandatory** | From next of kin. |
| **MTP (Abortion)** | **Woman only** (>18 yrs) | Husband's consent **NOT** required. Guardian if <18/mentally ill. |
| **Artificial Insemination**| **Both Spouses** | Written consent mandatory to avoid adultery/legitimacy issues. |

### Medicolegal Aspects of Consent
1.  **Negligence:** Failure to obtain informed consent is a form of [[Medical Negligence]]. If a procedure goes wrong and consent wasn't taken, the doctor has no defense.
2.  **Assault/Battery:** Performing a procedure without consent is a criminal offense (Battery), even if successful.
3.  **Extension of Operation:** Consent for one procedure does **not** imply consent for an additional procedure found necessary during surgery (unless life-threatening).
    *   *Example:* You cannot remove a diseased ovary while operating for appendicitis without specific prior consent or waking the patient up, unless the ovary has ruptured and threatens life.
4.  **Blanket Consent:** A general consent form signed at admission ("I give permission for any procedure...") is **invalid** in a court of law. Consent must be procedure-specific.
5.  **Refusal of Treatment:** A mentally competent adult has the absolute right to refuse life-saving treatment (e.g., blood transfusion in Jehovah's Witnesses). This must be documented as **Informed Refusal**.
