# [[Mechanical Injuries]] > intra-cranial hemorrhages

### Classification of Intracranial Hemorrhages
Intracranial hemorrhages are classified based on their location relative to the meningeal layers ([[Dura mater]], [[Arachnoid mater]], and [[Pia mater]]). They are broadly categorized into four types:
1.  **Extradural/Epidural Hemorrhage (EDH)**
2.  **Subdural Hemorrhage (SDH)**
3.  **Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)**
4.  **Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH)**

### 1. Extradural Hemorrhage (EDH)
Also known as Epidural Hematoma. It is the accumulation of blood between the **inner table of the skull** and the **dura mater**.

*   **Source of Bleeding:**
    *   **Arterial (Most common):** Rupture of the [[Middle Meningeal Artery]] (specifically the posterior branch) due to a fracture of the temporal bone (squamous part) or parietal bone.
    *   **Venous:** Injury to dural venous sinuses (e.g., Sagittal sinus from vertex blows) or diploic veins.
*   **Mechanism:** Usually caused by a direct blow or local impact (low velocity) causing local deformation of the skull and stripping of the dura.
*   **Lucid Interval:**
    *   A period of consciousness between the initial concussion (unconsciousness) and the onset of compression symptoms (coma).
    *   Seen in 30–50% of EDH cases.
    *   **Medicolegal Importance:** If a doctor discharges a patient during this interval and the patient subsequently dies, it may be grounds for [[Medical Negligence]].

#### Autopsy Appearances (EDH)
*   **Location:** Most common in the **temporoparietal region**. Rare at the base of the skull.
*   **Appearance:**
    *   **Disc-shaped** or **Biconvex (Lentiform)** mass.
    *   It is sharply localized and circumscribed because the dura is firmly attached to the skull sutures. **It does not cross suture lines**.
    *   The clot is usually firm, dark red, and adherent to the dura.
    *   The underlying brain surface shows a localized concavity (pressure effect).
*   **Differential Diagnosis:** **Heat Hematoma** (Postmortem artifact due to intense heat/burning). Heat hematoma is honeycomb-like, friable, and associated with skull fractures radiating from a central point, whereas EDH is a localized, solid clot.

### 2. Subdural Hemorrhage (SDH)
Accumulation of blood in the potential space between the **dura mater** and the **arachnoid mater**.

*   **Source of Bleeding:**
    *   Rupture of **Bridging Veins** (communicating veins) that pass from the cerebral cortex to the superior sagittal sinus.
    *   Can also occur from lacerations of the brain or rupture of dural sinuses.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **Rotational/Shearing forces:** Sudden acceleration or deceleration (e.g., falls, traffic accidents, [[Shaken Baby Syndrome]]).
    *   It requires less force than EDH and can occur without a skull fracture.
*   **Classification:**
    *   **Acute:** Symptoms within 24 hours.
    *   **Subacute:** Symptoms within 2–10 days.
    *   **Chronic:** Symptoms after weeks (common in alcoholics and elderly due to brain atrophy stretching the bridging veins).

#### Autopsy Appearances (SDH)
*   **Location:** Usually over the **cerebral convexities** (frontoparietal region). Can be bilateral.
*   **Appearance:**
    *   **Crescent-shaped** (concavo-convex) following the contour of the brain.
    *   **Crosses suture lines** (unlike EDH) but **does not cross the midline** (falx cerebri).
    *   **The Water Test:** At autopsy, subdural hemorrhage **can be washed away** with a gentle stream of water (unlike subarachnoid hemorrhage).
    *   **Chronic SDH:** May form a "membrane" or capsule around the clot. The blood may liquefy and resemble motor oil.

### 3. Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)
Accumulation of blood in the subarachnoid space (between **arachnoid** and **pia mater**), where CSF circulates. This is the **most common** form of traumatic intracranial hemorrhage.

*   **Source of Bleeding:**
    *   **Traumatic:** Laceration of cortical vessels, direct injury to vertebral arteries (blow to the side of the neck/angle of the jaw),.
    *   **Spontaneous (Pathological):** Rupture of **Berry Aneurysms** (Circle of Willis), arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), or hypertension.
*   **Berry Aneurysms:** Most commonly found at the bifurcation of cerebral arteries (Circle of Willis). Rupture is often precipitated by physical/emotional stress or trauma (e.g., a fistfight).

#### Autopsy Appearances (SAH)
*   **Appearance:**
    *   Diffuse, thin film of blood spreading over the brain surface, filling the sulci and cisterns.
    *   The brain surface appears intensely red/purple.
    *   **The Water Test:** The blood lies beneath the arachnoid membrane and **cannot be washed away** with water.
*   **Vertebral Artery Injury:** In cases of basal SAH following a fight (blow to the neck), careful dissection of the vertebral arteries is required to demonstrate the rupture.

### 4. Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH)
Bleeding within the **brain parenchyma** (substance of the brain).

*   **Source/Mechanism:**
    *   **Traumatic:** **Coup and Contrecoup** injuries. Laceration of brain tissue by bony prominences (e.g., orbital plates, sphenoid ridges).
    *   **Spontaneous:** Hypertension (rupture of Charcot-Bouchard aneurysms in basal ganglia), leukemia, or tumors,.
*   **Duret Hemorrhages:** Secondary brainstem hemorrhages (in midbrain/pons) due to raised intracranial pressure and herniation.

#### Autopsy Appearances (ICH)
*   **Traumatic:** Usually superficial, involving cortical gray matter and white matter. Commonly found in the **frontal and temporal lobes** (gliding contusions).
*   **Spontaneous:** Usually deep-seated (Basal ganglia, internal capsule).
*   **Features:** Areas of softening (encephalomalacia) and discoloration. Old lesions may form cystic cavities with brown hemosiderin staining.

### Comparison of Intracranial Hemorrhages

| Feature | Extradural (EDH) | Subdural (SDH) | Subarachnoid (SAH) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Location** | Between Skull & Dura | Between Dura & Arachnoid | Between Arachnoid & Pia |
| **Vessel Involved** | Middle Meningeal Artery | Bridging Veins | Cortical vessels / Aneurysms |
| **Shape** | Biconvex (Disc shaped) | Crescentic (Banana shaped) | Diffuse (follows sulci) |
| **Suture Lines** | **Limits spread** (Does not cross) | **Crosses sutures** | Diffuse |
| **Midline** | Can cross midline | Does not cross midline | Diffuse |
| **Autopsy Wash Test** | Clot is external to dura | **Washes away** | **Does not wash away** |
| **Lucid Interval** | Classical (Typical) | Rare | Absent |

### Mnemonics

*   **Causes of SAH:** **BATS**
    *   **B**erry Aneurysm
    *   **A**V Malformation
    *   **T**rauma (Most common)
    *   **S**troke
*   **Shape on Imaging/Autopsy:**
    *   **E**DH = **E**gg / **L**entiform (Biconvex) -> **L**emon
    *   **S**DH = **S**ickle / **C**rescent -> **B**anana

### Medicolegal Aspects
1.  **Lucid Interval:** Vital in negligence cases. If a doctor fails to diagnose EDH during the lucid interval and discharges the patient (who later collapses and dies), it constitutes **criminal negligence**,.
2.  **Trauma vs. Natural:** Differentiating traumatic SAH (vertebral artery rupture) from spontaneous SAH (Berry aneurysm rupture) is critical in homicide charges.
3.  **Boxer's Brain:** Repeated head trauma leads to **Dementia Pugilistica** (Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy), characterized by cerebral atrophy, thickened meninges, and cavum septum pellucidum, .
