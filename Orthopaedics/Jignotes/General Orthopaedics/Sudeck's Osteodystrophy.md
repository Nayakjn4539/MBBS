# Sudeck's Osteodystrophy (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome)

**Sudeck's Osteodystrophy**, commonly known today as **Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)** Type 1, is a chronic, painful, and disabling condition characterized by pain out of proportion to the initial injury, accompanied by sensory, autonomic, and motor disturbances. It is a state of autonomic dysfunction.

### Synonyms
*   [[Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy]] (RSD)
*   [[Complex Regional Pain Syndrome]] (CRPS) Type 1
*   [[Causalgia]] (CRPS Type 2 - associated with nerve injury)
*   [[Shoulder-Hand Syndrome]]
*   [[Algodystrophy]]
*   [[Sudeck's Atrophy]]

### Etiology and Risk Factors
The condition is usually triggered by a noxious event, though the severity of the syndrome does not correlate with the severity of the trauma.

*   **Trauma:** Often minor injuries, sprains, or crush injuries.
*   **Fractures:** Most commonly associated with [[Colles' fracture]] (Distal radius fracture) and [[Fractures of the foot/ankle]].
*   **Immobilization:** Tight casts or prolonged immobilization without active finger movements.
*   **Surgery:** Post-operative complication (e.g., Carpal tunnel release).
*   **Other causes:** [[Myocardial Infarction]], Stroke (CVA), Nerve injuries.
*   **Psychological factors:** Anxiety and depression may predispose or exacerbate the condition.

### Pathogenesis
The exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it involves a **Vicious Cycle** of sympathetic overactivity.

1.  **Sympathetic Dysfunction:** Injury activates pain pathways via catecholamines (norepinephrine).
2.  **Inflammatory Response:** Exaggerated inflammation and immune response.
3.  **Vasomotor Instability:** Leads to ischemia and further pain.
4.  **Central Sensitization:** Altered processing of pain in the central nervous system.

### Clinical Features
The clinical presentation typically evolves through three stages. The hallmark feature is **pain out of proportion to the injury**.

#### General Symptoms
*   **Pain:** Burning, throbbing, or aching. Often aggravated by movement or dependency.
*   **Stiffness:** Progressive loss of joint motion.
*   **Swelling:** Diffuse edema.
*   **Sensory Changes:** [[Hyperesthesia]] (increased sensitivity) or [[Allodynia]] (pain from non-painful stimuli).

#### Clinical Stages (Steinbrocker Classification)

| Stage | Name | Duration | Clinical Findings |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stage 1** | **Acute / Traumatic** | 0–3 Months | • **Pain:** Severe, burning.<br>• **Vasomotor:** Warm, red, flushed skin.<br>• **Sudomotor:** Hyperhidrosis (increased sweating).<br>• **Edema:** Soft and pitting. |
| **Stage 2** | **Dystrophic** | 3–6 Months | • **Pain:** Persists but may plateau.<br>• **Vasomotor:** Skin becomes **cool, pale, and cyanotic**.<br>• **Trophic:** Skin becomes **shiny/glossy**, hair loss, brittle nails.<br>• **Edema:** Becomes hard/brawny (indurated).<br>• **Stiffness:** Joints become stiff. |
| **Stage 3** | **Atrophic** | > 6 Months | • **Pain:** May decrease or persist.<br>• **Trophic:** Severe atrophy of skin and muscles.<br>• **Joints:** **Contractures** and "Frozen" joints (ankylosis).<br>• **Bones:** Severe osteoporosis.<br>• Irreversible structural changes. |

**Clinical Implication:**
> The "Shoulder-Hand Syndrome" is a variant where a patient with a wrist/hand injury develops stiffness and pain in the ipsilateral shoulder due to disuse, alongside the CRPS features in the hand.

### Diagnosis
Diagnosis is primarily **clinical**, based on history and physical examination.

#### 1. Radiology (X-Ray)
*   **Early stages:** May be normal.
*   **Established disease:** Shows characteristic **Spotty Rarefaction** or **Patchy Osteoporosis** (Sudeck's Atrophy).
*   Cortices become thinned, and cancellous bone shows a "ground glass" appearance.
*   Severe demineralization is seen in late stages.

#### 2. Bone Scan ([[Technetium-99m]])
*   Shows **increased uptake** (hot spots) in the affected region due to increased blood flow and metabolic activity in the early phase.
*   Highly sensitive for early diagnosis.

#### 3. Other Tests
*   **Thermography:** Detects temperature asymmetry between limbs.
*   **Sympathetic Blockade:** Relief of pain following a sympathetic block is diagnostic.

### Prevention
Prevention is far superior to cure, as established CRPS is notoriously difficult to treat.
*   **Early Mobilization:** Active finger movements in patients with distal radius fractures or casts.
*   **Avoid Tight Dressings/Casts:** Prevent constriction.
*   **Elevation:** To reduce edema.
*   **Gentle Handling:** Avoid forceful manipulation of fractures.

---

### Management
Treatment is prolonged and requires a multidisciplinary approach. **"Patience"** is required from both the doctor and the patient.

#### 1. Physical Therapy (Mainstay of Treatment)
*   **Active Mobilization:** Encourage active use of the limb despite pain.
*   **Passive Motion:** Should be gentle; forceful passive movements are **contraindicated** as they aggravate the condition.
*   **Elevation:** To control edema.
*   **Desensitization techniques:** Rubbing different textures on the skin.
*   **Wax Baths:** For stiffness.

#### 2. Pharmacological Therapy
*   **Analgesics:** [[NSAIDs]], Opioids (limited use).
*   **Corticosteroids:** Systemic steroids (e.g., Prednisolone) may help in acute inflammatory phases.
*   **Anticonvulsants:** [[Gabapentin]] or Pregabalin for neuropathic pain.
*   **Antidepressants:** Amitriptyline (Tricyclic antidepressants).
*   **Bone resorption inhibitors:** [[Calcitonin]] (nasal spray) or [[Bisphosphonates]] to treat osteodystrophy.
*   **Beta-blockers:** Sometimes used for vascular symptoms.
*   **Free Radical Scavengers:** Vitamin C (high dose) is sometimes used preventatively.

#### 3. Interventional Therapy (Sympathetic Blockade)
Used if conservative measures fail.
*   **Stellate Ganglion Block:** For upper limb CRPS.
*   **Lumbar Sympathetic Block:** For lower limb CRPS.
*   **Regional Intravenous Block:** Using [[Guanethidine]] or Reserpine (Bier's block technique).

#### 4. Surgical Intervention
*   **Sympathectomy:** Surgical removal of sympathetic ganglia (rarely indicated now).
*   Treatment of deformities (e.g., capsulotomy) only in the quiescent stage.
