# Anatomy of the Conjunctiva

The [[conjunctiva]] is a translucent, thin mucous membrane that lines the posterior surface of the [[eyelids]] and the anterior aspect of the [[eyeball]]. It stretches from the lid margin to the [[limbus]] and encloses a complex potential space called the [[conjunctival sac]], which opens anteriorly at the [[palpebral fissure]].

### Gross Anatomy: Parts of Conjunctiva

The conjunctiva is divided into three main geographic zones:

**1. [[Palpebral Conjunctiva]]**
Lines the inner surface of the eyelids. It is firmly adherent to the underlying tissues.
*   **Marginal Conjunctiva:** Extends from the lid margin to the [[sulcus subtarsalis]] (a shallow groove 2mm from the margin). It acts as a transitional zone between skin and true conjunctiva.
*   **Tarsal Conjunctiva:** Thin, transparent, and highly vascular.
    *   *Upper Lid:* Firmly adherent to the whole [[tarsal plate]].
    *   *Lower Lid:* Adherent only to half the width of the tarsus.
    *   *Clinical Feature:* The [[meibomian glands]] are visible through it as yellow streaks vertically arranged.
*   **Orbital Conjunctiva:** Lies loose between the tarsal plate and the fornix.

**2. [[Bulbar Conjunctiva]]**
Lines the anterior part of the sclera.
*   It is thin and transparent, allowing the underlying white [[sclera]] and episcleral vessels to be seen.
*   It is loosely attached to the underlying [[Tenon's capsule]] and episcleral tissue, allowing free movement of the eyeball.
*   **Limbal Conjunctiva:** A 3mm ridge around the cornea. Here, the conjunctiva, Tenon’s capsule, and episcleral tissue fuse into a dense tissue strongly adherent to the [[corneoscleral junction]]. At the [[limbus]], the conjunctival epithelium becomes continuous with the [[corneal epithelium]].

**3. [[Conjunctival Fornix]] (Forniceal Conjunctiva)**
A continuous circular cul-de-sac connecting the palpebral and bulbar portions. It is loose and redundant to allow eye movement.
*   **Subdivisions:** Superior, Inferior, Medial, and Lateral fornices.
*   **Note:** The lateral fornix is the deepest. The fornix is broken medially by the [[caruncle]] and [[plica semilunaris]].

**Other Structures:**
*   **[[Plica Semilunaris]]:** A pinkish crescentic fold in the medial canthus. It is a vestigial structure representing the nictitating membrane (third eyelid) of lower animals.
*   **[[Caruncle]]:** A small, ovoid pinkish mass medial to the plica. It is a piece of modified skin containing sweat glands, sebaceous glands, and hair follicles.

### Histology of Conjunctiva

Microscopically, the conjunctiva consists of three distinct layers:

#### 1. Epithelium
Non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. The number of layers varies by region:

| Region | Number of Layers | Cell Types |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Marginal** | 5 layers | Stratified squamous |
| **Tarsal** | 2 layers | Superficial cylindrical, Deep flat |
| **Fornix & Bulbar** | 3 layers | Superficial cylindrical, Middle polyhedral, Deep cuboidal |
| **Limbal** | 5-6 layers | Stratified squamous (Contains [[limbal stem cells]]) |

*   **[[Goblet Cells]]:** Unicellular mucin-secreting glands located within the epithelium.
    *   **Density:** Maximum in the inferonasal bulbar conjunctiva and inferior fornix.
    *   **Function:** Secrete mucin essential for wetting the cornea and tear film stability.

#### 2. Adenoid Layer (Lymphoid Layer)
*   Consists of fine connective tissue reticulum housing [[lymphocytes]].
*   **Clinical Implication:** This layer is **not present at birth**. It develops after 3-4 months of life. Therefore, conjunctival inflammation in infants (e.g., [[ophthalmia neonatorum]]) does not produce a follicular reaction.

#### 3. Fibrous Layer
*   Consists of a meshwork of collagenous and elastic fibers.
*   Contains the vessels and nerves of the conjunctiva.
*   It is thicker than the adenoid layer (except in the tarsal region).

### Glands of the Conjunctiva

These are classified into mucin secretors and accessory lacrimal glands.

| Type | Glands | Location | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mucin Secretory** | [[Goblet cells]] | Epithelium (Max density: nasal bulbar/inf. fornix) | Secrete mucin (innermost tear layer) |
| | [[Crypts of Henle]] | Tarsal conjunctiva | Secrete mucin |
| | [[Glands of Manz]] | Limbal conjunctiva | Secrete mucin |
| **Accessory Lacrimal** | [[Glands of Krause]] | Subconjunctival tissue of fornices (~42 upper, 8 lower) | Basal tear secretion (Aqueous) |
| | [[Glands of Wolfring]] | Upper border of superior tarsus / lower border of inferior tarsus | Basal tear secretion (Aqueous) |

### Blood Supply

The conjunctiva has a rich vascular supply derived from two main sources:

1.  **[[Palpebral Conjunctiva]] & Fornices:** Supplied by the **peripheral** and **marginal arterial arcades** of the eyelids.
2.  **[[Bulbar Conjunctiva]]:** Supplied by two sets of vessels:
    *   **Posterior Conjunctival Arteries:** Branches from the arterial arcades of the eyelids.
    *   **Anterior Conjunctival Arteries:** Branches of the [[anterior ciliary arteries]].
    *   *Note:* The terminal branches of these two systems anastomose to form the [[pericorneal plexus]] at the limbus.

### Nerve Supply

*   **Circumcorneal Zone:** Supplied by branches from the **[[long ciliary nerves]]**.
*   **Rest of Conjunctiva:** Supplied by branches of the [[ophthalmic nerve]] (CN V1) and [[maxillary nerve]] (CN V2):
    *   [[Lacrimal nerve]]
    *   [[Infratrochlear nerve]]
    *   [[Supratrochlear nerve]]
    *   [[Supraorbital nerve]]
    *   [[Frontal nerve]]

### Lymphatic Drainage

The lymphatics are arranged in superficial and deep layers. Drainage is site-specific:

*   **Lateral side:** Drains into the **[[preauricular lymph nodes]]**.
*   **Medial side:** Drains into the **[[submandibular lymph nodes]]**.

### Clinical Signs Differentiation

Distinguishing between conjunctival and ciliary congestion is vital for diagnosis.

| Feature | [[Conjunctival Congestion]] | [[Ciliary Congestion]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Site** | More marked in fornices | More marked around limbus (circumcorneal) |
| **Colour** | Bright red | Purple / Dull red / Lilac |
| **Vessels** | Superficial and branching | Deep and radiating |
| **Movement** | Moves with conjunctiva | Does not move |
| **Blanching** | Blanches immediately with vasoconstrictors (e.g., Phenylephrine) | Does not blanch |
| **Common Causes** | [[Acute Conjunctivitis]] | [[Iridocyclitis]], [[Keratitis]], [[Acute Congestive Glaucoma]] |
