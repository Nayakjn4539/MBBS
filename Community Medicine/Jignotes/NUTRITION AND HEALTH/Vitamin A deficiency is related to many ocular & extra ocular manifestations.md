# [[NUTRITION AND HEALTH]] > Vitamin A deficiency is related to many ocular & extra ocular manifestations

### Vitamin A Deficiency Manifestations

[[Vitamin A deficiency]] (VAD) is a major public health problem leading to a spectrum of ocular and extra-ocular manifestations. The term **Xerophthalmia** ("Dry Eye") covers all ocular manifestations of VAD.

#### A. Ocular Manifestations (Xerophthalmia)

The ocular changes generally progress in severity if left untreated. They are classified by the [[WHO]] as follows:

**1. Night Blindness (Nyctalopia) - XN**
*   This is the **first clinical symptom** of Vitamin A deficiency.
*   The child cannot see in dim light or at twilight.
*   Parents often notice the child is clumsy or inactive after sunset.
*   **Clinical Relevance:** It is due to the impairment of *dark adaptation* (function of rods in the retina).

**2. Conjunctival Xerosis - X1A**
*   This is the **first clinical sign** of VAD.
*   The [[conjunctiva]] becomes dry, thickened, wrinkled, and non-wettable.
*   It loses its shiny luster and appears muddy or smoky.
*   *Classic Description:* It looks like "sand banks at receding tide" when the child stops crying.

**3. Bitot's Spots - X1B**
*   These are triangular, pearly-white or yellowish, **foamy/cheesy patches** on the bulbar conjunctiva.
*   They are usually bilateral and located temporal to the cornea.
*   The foamy appearance is due to gas-producing diphtheroids (Corynebacterium xerosis) in the keratinized epithelium.
*   **Note:** In young children, it indicates active deficiency. In adults, it may be an inactive scar from past disease.

**4. Corneal Xerosis - X2**
*   The dryness extends to the [[cornea]].
*   The cornea appears dull, dry, lusterless, and non-wettable.
*   It may take on a "ground-glass" appearance.

**5. Corneal Ulceration/Keratomalacia - X3A & X3B**
*   **X3A:** Corneal ulceration involving **< 1/3** of the corneal surface.
*   **X3B:** Corneal ulceration involving **> 1/3** of the corneal surface (Keratomalacia).
*   **Keratomalacia:** This is the liquefaction (melting) of the cornea. It is a **grave medical emergency**.
*   The cornea becomes soft and may burst (perforate), leading to prolapse of iris and total loss of vision.

**6. Corneal Scar - XS**
*   Healed sequelae of corneal ulcers.
*   Leads to permanent opacity and blindness (Leukoma).

**7. Xerophthalmic Fundus - XF**
*   Typical seed-like, white spots scattered over the retina.

#### WHO Classification of Xerophthalmia

| Code | Stage/Condition | Diagnostic Relevance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **XN** | Night Blindness | First Symptom |
| **X1A** | Conjunctival Xerosis | First Sign |
| **X1B** | Bitot’s Spots | Pathognomonic |
| **X2** | Corneal Xerosis | Severe deficiency |
| **X3A** | Corneal Ulceration (<1/3) | Medical Emergency |
| **X3B** | Keratomalacia (>1/3) | Blinding |
| **XS** | Corneal Scar | Sequelae |
| **XF** | Xerophthalmic Fundus | Rare |

### Mnemonic for WHO Classification
**"N**ight **C**lubs **B**ring **C**razy **U**rban **K**ids **S**carred"

*   **N** - **N**ight blindness (XN)
*   **C** - **C**onjunctival xerosis (X1A)
*   **B** - **B**itot's spots (X1B)
*   **C** - **C**orneal xerosis (X2)
*   **U** - **U**lceration (X3A)
*   **K** - **K**eratomalacia (X3B)
*   **S** - **S**car (XS)

#### B. Extra-Ocular Manifestations

Vitamin A is essential for epithelial integrity and immunity. Deficiency leads to systemic issues:

1.  **Follicular Hyperkeratosis (Phrynoderma/Toad Skin):**
    *   Rough, dry, scaly skin with papular eruptions.
    *   Typically seen on the shoulders, buttocks, and extensor surfaces of limbs.
    *   *Note:* Phrynoderma is also associated with Essential Fatty Acid (EFA) and B-complex deficiency.

2.  **Growth Retardation:**
    *   Vitamin A is essential for skeletal growth; deficiency leads to stunting.

3.  **Increased Susceptibility to Infections:**
    *   Vitamin A is often called the **"Anti-infective Vitamin"**.
    *   Deficiency impairs the epithelial lining of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.
    *   Leads to increased severity and mortality from **Diarrhea**, **Respiratory Infections**, and **Measles**.

4.  **Anorexia:**
    *   Loss of appetite is a common generalized symptom.

#### Clinical Relevance
*   **Measles & VAD:** Measles precipitates severe Vitamin A deficiency (keratomalacia) rapidly. Therefore, high-dose Vitamin A supplementation is mandatory in the treatment of measles.
*   **Pregnancy:** VAD is associated with increased maternal mortality and low birth weight.
*   **Prevention:** Under the National Programme, a massive dose of Vitamin A (100,000 IU for <1yr; 200,000 IU for >1yr) is given prophylactically every 6 months to prevent nutritional blindness.
