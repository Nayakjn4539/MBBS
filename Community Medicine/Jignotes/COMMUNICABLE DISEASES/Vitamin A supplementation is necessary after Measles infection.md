# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Vitamin A supplementation is necessary after Measles infection

### Vitamin A Supplementation in Measles Infection

**Rationale for Supplementation**
Measles is a severe disease that significantly depletes the body's stores of [[Vitamin A]], precipitating acute deficiency even in previously well-nourished children.
*   **Preventing Blindness:** Measles is a major precipitating factor for [[Xerophthalmia]] (dry eye) and [[Keratomalacia]] (liquefaction of cornea), leading to permanent blindness due to corneal scarring,.
*   **Reducing Mortality:** Supplementation reduces the risk of mortality and morbidity associated with complications like diarrhea, pneumonia, and croup.
*   **Synergism:** The relationship between malnutrition (specifically Vitamin A deficiency) and infection creates a vicious cycle; measles pushes the child into acute malnutrition.

**Target Population**
*   All cases of **severe measles**.
*   All cases of measles in areas with **high case-fatality rates**.
*   All children suffering from measles if they have not received a dose in the previous one month.

### Dosage Schedule and Administration

The treatment involves high doses of Vitamin A administered orally immediately upon diagnosis.

**Timing of Doses**
1.  **First Dose:** Immediately on diagnosis (Day 0).
2.  **Second Dose:** The very next day (Day 1).
3.  **Third Dose:** Given **4–6 weeks later** *only if* the child has clinical signs of Vitamin A deficiency (e.g., [[Bitot’s spots]], night blindness),.

**Age-Specific Dosage Table**,

| Age Group | Dose (International Units) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Infants < 6 months** | 50,000 IU |
| **Infants 6 – 11 months** | 100,000 IU |
| **Children > 12 months** | 200,000 IU |

> **Note:** For oral administration, an oil-based formulation is preferred.

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Diagnosis:** Diagnosis of measles is based on the typical rash and [[Koplik’s spots]] on the buccal mucosa.
*   **Emergency:** [[Keratomalacia]] is a medical emergency. If the eye collapses, vision is lost; hence, immediate Vitamin A therapy is critical.
*   **Contraindications:** There are generally no contraindications for Vitamin A during active measles infection due to the high risk of blindness, but standard precautions regarding toxicity in massive overdose should be kept in mind (though rare in this short regimen).

**Mnemonic to remember the Schedule:**
**"Save The Eyes" (S-T-E)**
*   **S**tart: Immediately (Day 0)
*   **T**omorrow: Next day (Day 1)
*   **E**xtra: After 4 weeks (if Eye signs present)
