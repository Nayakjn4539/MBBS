# Diseases Affecting Ear Formation in Utero (Congenital Anomalies of the Ear)

The development of the ear is complex, involving structures from the branchial apparatus (external and middle ear) and the [[otic placode]] (inner ear). Because these systems have different embryological origins, malformations can occur in isolation or in combination.

### I. Embryological Basis of Malformations

Understanding the timing and origin of development helps in classifying the defects.

*   **Inner Ear ([[Labyrinth]]):** Develops from the [[otic placode]] (surface ectoderm). Differentitation occurs early (3rd–16th week).
    *   **Pars Superior:** [[Semicircular canals]] and [[utricle]].
    *   **Pars Inferior:** [[Saccule]] and [[cochlea]].
*   **Middle Ear:**
    *   **Cavity & Tube:** Derived from the **1st pharyngeal pouch** (Endoderm).
    *   **Ossicles:** [[Malleus]] and [[Incus]] from **1st Arch** (Meckel’s cartilage); [[Stapes]] superstructure from **2nd Arch** (Reichert’s cartilage); [[Stapes footplate]] from the [[otic capsule]].
*   **External Ear:**
    *   **Pinna:** Develops from **6 Hillocks of His** (1st and 2nd Branchial Arches) around the 6th week.
    *   **EAC:** Develops from the **1st Branchial Cleft** (Ectoderm).

### II. Anomalies of the External Ear

These defects range from minor cosmetic issues to complete absence of the ear. They are often associated with conductive hearing loss.

#### A. Defects of the Pinna (Auricle)

| Anomaly | Description | Clinical Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Anotia]]** | Complete absence of the pinna. | Rare; often part of 1st arch syndromes. |
| **[[Microtia]]** | Small, malformed auricle. | Varies in severity. Severe form: **Peanut ear**. Frequently associated with meatal atresia. |
| **[[Macrotia]]** | Abnormally large pinna. | Cosmetic concern. |
| **[[Bat Ear]]** (Prominent Ear) | Pinna projects excessively. | Due to large concha or poorly developed antihelix. Correctable by [[Otoplasty]] (Pinnaplasty) after age 6. |
| **[[Lop Ear]]** / Cup Ear | Hypoplasia of upper 1/3 of auricle. | Helix is cupped or folded down. |
| **[[Cryptotia]]** (Pocket Ear) | Upper 1/3 of auricle buried under scalp skin. | Requires mobilization and skin graft. |
| **[[Coloboma]]** | Transverse cleft in the middle of the auricle. | Rare. |
| **[[Preauricular Sinus]]** | Pit/tract at the root of the helix. | Due to faulty fusion of the Hillocks of His. Can get infected/form abscess. |
| **[[Darwin’s Tubercle]]** | Pointed prominence on the helix. | Evolutionary remnant; no clinical significance. |
| **Accessory Auricles** | Skin tags (Preauricular tags). | Usually anterior to tragus; contain cartilage. |

**Clinical Implication:**
*   **Reconstruction:** For [[Microtia]], total ear reconstruction using carved **autologous costal cartilage** is usually performed after **8–10 years** of age (when the rib cage is sufficient size).
*   **Hearing:** Bone Anchored Hearing Aids ([[BAHA]]) are often used if bilateral atresia is present.

#### B. Defects of the External Auditory Canal (EAC)

1.  **[[Atresia of EAC]]**
    *   Failure of canalization of the epithelial plug (28th week).
    *   Can be bony or fibrous.
    *   Often associated with Microtia.
2.  **[[Collaural Fistula]]**
    *   Anomaly of the **1st Branchial Cleft**.
    *   Fistula connects the neck (angle of mandible) to the EAC.
    *   Tract may pass through the [[parotid gland]] near the [[facial nerve]].

### III. Anomalies of the Middle Ear

These cause congenital [[conductive hearing loss]].

1.  **Ossicular Anomalies:**
    *   **Fixation:** Most common is **fixation of the [[stapes footplate]]**.
    *   **Discontinuity:** Fusion of malleus and incus, or absence of stapes superstructure.
    *   **Clinical:** Non-progressive conductive loss since birth.
2.  **[[Congenital Cholesteatoma]]:**
    *   **Origin:** Embryonic epidermal cell rests (epidermoid formation) trapped in the middle ear.
    *   **Levenson’s Criteria:** White mass behind an *intact* tympanic membrane, no history of otorrhea, no prior surgery.
    *   **Location:** Commonly anterosuperior middle ear or petrous apex.
3.  **Vascular Anomalies:**
    *   High [[jugular bulb]] or aberrant [[internal carotid artery]] in the middle ear.
    *   **Warning:** Risk of massive bleeding during myringotomy.
4.  **Facial Nerve Anomalies:**
    *   Dehiscence of the fallopian canal (tympanic segment).
    *   Displacement of the nerve (common in microtia/atresia cases).

### IV. Anomalies of the Inner Ear (Labyrinthine Dysplasias)

Defects in the membranous or bony labyrinth result in [[sensorineural hearing loss]] (SNHL).

#### Classification of Inner Ear Aplasias

| Type | Defect Description | Anatomy Involved | Hearing Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Michel Aplasia]]** | Complete absence of inner ear. | Bony & Membranous labyrinth absent. | Total Anacusis (Deafness). **Contraindication for [[Cochlear Implant]]**. |
| **[[Mondini Dysplasia]]** | Incomplete partition; flattened cochlea. | Cochlea has **1.5 turns** (instead of 2.5). Vestibule dilated. | Variable SNHL. Risk of perilymph fistula. |
| **[[Scheibe Dysplasia]]** | **Most Common** type. Cochleosaccular dysplasia. | **Pars Inferior** defect (Cochlea + Saccule affected). Pars Superior (Canals/Utricle) normal. | Profound SNHL. Good candidate for Cochlear Implant. |
| **[[Alexander Dysplasia]]** | Dysplasia of the **basal turn** of cochlea. | Membranous cochlea affected. | **High-frequency** SNHL. |
| **[[Bing-Siebenmann Dysplasia]]**| Complete membranous aplasia. | Bony labyrinth is normal; Membranous is absent. | Profound SNHL. |

> **Mnemonic for Inner Ear Dysplasias:**
> *   **Michel** is **Missing** (Total absence).
> *   **Mo**ndini is **Mo**dified (1.5 turns).
> *   **S**cheibe is **S**accule (Pars inferior defect).
> *   **A**lexander is **A**pex? No, **Base**! (Basal turn defect).

#### Other Inner Ear Anomalies

1.  **Large/Enlarged Vestibular Aqueduct ([[LVA]]/EVA):**
    *   Associated with **[[Pendred Syndrome]]**.
    *   Symptoms: Step-wise progressive SNHL, often triggered by minor head trauma.
2.  **Superior Semicircular Canal Dehiscence ([[SSCD]]):**
    *   Thinning or absence of bone over the Superior SCC.
    *   **Third Window Effect:** Sound energy dissipates.
    *   **Tullio Phenomenon:** Vertigo induced by loud sounds.
    *   **Hennebert’s Sign:** Vertigo induced by pressure (tragal compression).

### V. Etiology of Congenital Ear Diseases

#### A. Genetic Causes (Syndromic & Non-Syndromic)
Approx. 50% of congenital deafness is genetic.

**1. Autosomal Dominant:**
*   **[[Waardenburg Syndrome]]**: White forelock, heterochromia iridis, SNHL, dystopia canthorum.
*   **[[Treacher Collins Syndrome]]**: Mandibulofacial dysostosis. Malformed pinna, atresia, ossicular defects, downward slanting eyes.
*   **[[Branchio-oto-renal Syndrome]]**: Branchial cysts/fistulas, ear pits, renal anomalies, hearing loss.
*   **[[Stickler Syndrome]]**: Cleft palate, myopia, retinal detachment, arthritis.

**2. Autosomal Recessive:**
*   **[[Usher Syndrome]]**: SNHL + **Retinitis Pigmentosa** (Night blindness).
*   **[[Pendred Syndrome]]**: SNHL + Thyroid goiter (Defect in iodine organization) + Enlarged Vestibular Aqueduct.
*   **[[Jervell and Lange-Nielsen Syndrome]]**: Profound SNHL + Prolonged QT interval (Risk of sudden cardiac death).

**3. X-Linked:**
*   **[[Alport Syndrome]]**: SNHL + Glomerulonephritis (Kidney failure) + Eye defects (Anterior lenticonus).

#### B. Non-Genetic (Environmental/Infectious) Causes (TORCH)

1.  **[[Rubella]] (German Measles):**
    *   Triad: Deafness, Cataract, Heart defects.
    *   Audiogram: **Cookie-bite** curve (mid-frequency loss).
2.  **[[Cytomegalovirus]] (CMV):**
    *   Leading cause of non-genetic congenital SNHL.
    *   Progressive SNHL, intracranial calcifications.
3.  **[[Congenital Syphilis]]:**
    *   Early or Late onset.
    *   **Hutchinson’s Triad:** SNHL, Interstitial keratitis, Hutchinson’s teeth.
    *   **Hennebert’s Sign:** Positive fistula test without a fistula (due to hypermobile stapes/fibrous bands).
4.  **Drugs (Teratogens):**
    *   **[[Thalidomide]]**: Phocomelia + Anotia/Microtia.
    *   **Isotretinoin**: Microtia, canal stenosis.
    *   **Ototoxic drugs**: Aminoglycosides, Quinine during pregnancy.

### VI. Diagnostic Approach & Management

1.  **Screening:**
    *   **OAE ([[Otoacoustic Emissions]]):** Screening test for newborns (tests Outer Hair Cells).
    *   **BERA/ABR ([[Auditory Brainstem Response]]):** Confirmatory test; assesses neural pathway.
2.  **Imaging:**
    *   **HRCT Temporal Bone:** Best for bony anatomy (Ossicles, Mondini, Atresia).
    *   **MRI:** Best for membranous labyrinth, auditory nerve aplasia, and cochlear patency.
3.  **Management:**
    *   **Early Intervention:** Critical for speech development (Plasticity of brain).
    *   **Hearing Aids:** For mild/moderate loss.
    *   **[[Cochlear Implants]]**: For severe-to-profound SNHL (if cochlea/nerve present).
    *   **[[Brainstem Implants]] (ABI):** If cochlear nerve is absent (e.g., Michel aplasia).
    *   **Surgical Reconstruction:** For Microtia/Atresia (after age 6-8).
