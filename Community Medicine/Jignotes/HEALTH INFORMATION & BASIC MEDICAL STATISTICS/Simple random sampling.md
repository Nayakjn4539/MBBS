### Simple Random Sampling

**Definition**
Simple Random Sampling is a type of [[probability sampling]] where every individual or unit in the defined population (universe) has an **equal and known chance** of being selected. It is also known as **Unrestricted Random Sampling**.

**Prerequisites**
For this method to be effective, the following conditions must be met:
1.  The population must be **small**, **homogeneous**, and readily available.
2.  A complete list of all units in the population ([[sampling frame]]) must be available.

**Methods of Selection**
There are three common techniques to conduct simple random sampling:

1.  **Lottery Method**: 
    *   Assign a number to each unit in the population.
    *   Write numbers on separate slips/cards.
    *   Shuffle them well in a container.
    *   Blindly draw the required number of slips. This is "sampling without replacement" if cards are not put back.

2.  **Table of Random Numbers**: 
    *   Assign a serial number to each unit in the sampling frame.
    *   Use published tables (like Fisher's or Yates' tables).
    *   Select a starting point blindly and proceed in a specific direction (row/column/diagonal) to select numbers. Numbers larger than the population size are rejected or divided to use the remainder.

3.  **Computer Software**: 
    *   Modern statistical software can generate random lists instantly.

**Merits (Advantages)**
*   **Unbiased**: It eliminates personal selection bias/human preference.
*   **Representativeness**: If the population is homogeneous, it provides a highly representative sample.
*   **Statistical Validity**: It allows for the calculation of [[sampling error]] and confidence limits.

**Demerits (Disadvantages)**
*   **Impractical for Large Populations**: Numbering every individual in a large country or city is impossible.
*   **Needs Complete List**: A complete sampling frame is often unavailable in field surveys.
*   **Cost and Time**: It can be laborious if the selected units are widely scattered geographically.

**Clinical Relevance**
*   **[[Clinical Trials]]**: Used when selecting a small group of patients from a specific hospital ward to test the efficacy of a new drug.
*   **Pilot Studies**: useful for preliminary investigations in a defined, small setting.

**Mnemonic**
To remember the features of **SRS** (Simple Random Sampling):
*   **S** - **S**mall Population (Best for small groups)
*   **R** - **R**andom Tables (Method of choice)
*   **S** - **S**ame Chance (Equal probability for everyone)
