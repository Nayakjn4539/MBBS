# [[NUTRITION AND HEALTH]] > Common homemade oral rehydration solution

### Common Homemade Oral Rehydration Solution

When standard [[Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS)]] packets are not immediately available, homemade solutions and **Home Available Fluids (HAF)** are critical first-line interventions to prevent [[dehydration]] caused by diarrhea. These fluids must be administered at the onset of diarrhea.

#### 1. The Standard Sugar-Salt Solution
This is the most common substitute when commercial ORS is unavailable. It is vital to maintain the correct proportions to ensure the solution is isotonic and effective.

**Preparation Formula:**
| Ingredient | Quantity | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Clean Drinking Water** | 1 Liter (approx. 5 cupfuls) | Solvent/Vehicle for rehydration |
| **Sugar (Sucrose)** | **6 Level Teaspoons** | Provides energy and facilitates Sodium absorption via [[Sodium-Glucose Co-transport]] |
| **Common Salt (NaCl)** | **1 Level Teaspoon** | Replaces electrolyte loss (Sodium and Chloride) |

*   **Note:** If 1 liter is too much to measure, the ratio is **1 pinch of salt + 1 scoop (fistful) of sugar + 1 glass of water** (Rough estimation for field conditions).
*   The solution should be tasted; it should taste no saltier than tears.

#### 2. Home Available Fluids (HAF)
Apart from the sugar-salt solution, traditional fluids available in the household can be used. These must contain **salt** and a **carbohydrate** source.

*   **Salted Rice Water (Kanji):** Water drained from cooked rice with added salt.
*   **Dal Water:** The liquid portion of cooked pulses (contains proteins and starch).
*   **Buttermilk (Lassi/Chach):** Should be salted.
*   **Lemonade (Shikanji):** Prepared with salt and sugar.
*   **Coconut Water:** Excellent source of Potassium and glucose.
*   **Weak Tea:** Should be sweetened and lightly salted.
*   **Soups:** Vegetable or chicken soups (unsalted soups should have 3g salt/liter added).

#### 3. Fluids to AVOID
Certain fluids are dangerous during diarrhea as they can worsen dehydration due to high osmolarity (osmotic diarrhea) or diuretic effects.

*   **Commercial Carbonated Beverages:** Too much sugar, high osmolarity.
*   **Commercial Fruit Juices:** Hyperosmolar; can pull water into the gut.
*   **Coffee:** Diuretic effect increases fluid loss.
*   **Alcohol:** Diuretic and dehydrating.

#### Clinical Relevance
*   **Plan A Management:** Homemade solutions are the cornerstone of *Plan A* (Home management of diarrhea) in the [[IMNCI]] guidelines. The goal is to **prevent** dehydration, not to treat severe dehydration (which requires IV fluids or Standard ORS).
*   **Continued Feeding:** These fluids must be accompanied by continued feeding (including breastfeeding) to prevent malnutrition.
*   **Limitations:** Homemade solutions (especially sugar-salt) may lack Potassium and Bicarbonate/Citrate (which corrects acidosis), unlike the WHO standard ORS formula. Therefore, they are "stop-gap" measures until standard ORS is obtained.

### Mnemonic
To remember the Sugar-Salt Ratio:
**"Six Sweet Sisters and One Salty Brother"**
*(**6** teaspoons of Sugar + **1** teaspoon of Salt)*
