# [[OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH]] > Pre-placement examination

# Pre-placement Examination

### Definition and Importance
**Pre-placement examination** (also known as pre-employment examination) is the **foundation** of an efficient [[occupational health service]]. It is a medical examination conducted at the time of employment before the worker commences their specific duty.

### Objectives
The primary purpose is based on the principle of **Ergonomics**: *"Fitting the job to the worker"*.
1.  To place the **right man in the right job**.
2.  To ensure the worker can perform duties efficiently without detriment to their health.
3.  To establish a **baseline** (benchmark) of health status for future comparison during periodic examinations.
4.  To adapt the job to the worker and the worker to the job.

### Components of the Examination
The examination must be thorough and include the following:
*   **Detailed History:**
    *   Medical history
    *   Family history
    *   Occupational history
    *   Social history.
*   **Physical Examination:** A thorough general and systemic clinical examination.
*   **Investigations:** A battery of biological and radiological examinations is often required:
    *   Chest X-ray
    *   Electrocardiogram (ECG)
    *   Vision testing
    *   Urine and blood examinations
    *   Special tests for endemic diseases.

### Outcomes of the Examination
Based on the findings, a fresh recruit is either:
1.  Totally **rejected**.
2.  **Accepted** for the specific job.
3.  Given a job **suited** to their physical and mental abilities (e.g., A person with a potential hernia should not be assigned weight lifting; a color-blind person should not be employed as a driver).

### Medical Contraindications for Specific Occupations
It is risky to employ persons suffering from certain diseases in specific hazardous occupations.

| Occupational Hazard | Undesirable Pre-existing Conditions (Contraindications) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Lead Poisoning]]** | Anemia, Hypertension, Nephritis, Peptic ulcer |
| **Dyes** | Asthma, Skin disease, Bladder/Kidney disease, Precancerous lesions |
| **Solvents** | Liver and Kidney disease, Dermatitis, Alcoholism |
| **Silica** | Healed or active [[Tuberculosis]] of lungs, Chronic lung disease |
| **Radium / X-rays** | Signs of ill-health, especially any blood disease |

### Mnemonic
**"B-SAFE"**
*   **B** - **B**aseline data establishment
*   **S** - **S**afety of the worker and coworkers
*   **A** - **A**daptation of work to man (Ergonomics)
*   **F** - **F**itness for the specific job
*   **E** - **E**fficiency in work productivity

### Clinical Relevance
In developing countries like India, many workers in small-scale industries, mines, and agriculture often start employment without the benefit of a pre-employment medical examination. This leads to early development of occupational diseases which could have been prevented by proper screening and job placement.
