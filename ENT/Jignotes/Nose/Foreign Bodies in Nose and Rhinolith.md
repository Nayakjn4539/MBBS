# Foreign Bodies in the Nose

### Introduction and Epidemiology
Foreign bodies in the nose are a common otolaryngological emergency, predominantly observed in children, though they can occur in adults (often psychiatric patients or accidental).
*   **Route of Entry:**
    *   **Anterior:** Most common; objects are pushed through the anterior nares.
    *   **Posterior:** Vomited material or food entering through the choanae due to regurgitation (incompetent nasopharyngeal sphincter).
    *   **Penetrating:** Through the soft tissue (e.g., bullets, shrapnel).

### Classification
Foreign bodies are broadly classified based on their nature:

| Type | Characteristics | Examples | Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inanimate** | Non-living objects. | | |
| *Organic (Vegetative)* | Hygroscopic (absorb water and swell), irritate mucosa. | Beans, seeds (peas, tamarind), wood,. | Cause violent reaction (**Vegetal Bronchitis**), local inflammation, and can become impacted due to swelling,. |
| *Inorganic* | Non-irritating, inert. | Beads, buttons, chalk, paper, rubber, sponge, stones,. | May remain asymptomatic for a long period. |
| **Animate** | Living organisms. | Maggots ([[Nasal Myiasis]]), leeches,. | Cause intense irritation, bleeding, and tissue destruction. |
| **Button Batteries** | **MEDICAL EMERGENCY** | Small disk batteries. | Leakage causes **liquefaction necrosis** and severe tissue destruction leading to [[Septal Perforation]] or stenosis. |

### Clinical Features
Children often hide the history of insertion due to fear. The presentation depends on the duration.

**Symptoms:**
*   **Unilateral Nasal Discharge:** This is the hallmark symptom. It is often **foul-smelling (fetid)**, purulent, and occasionally **blood-stained**,.
*   **Nasal Obstruction:** Usually unilateral.
*   **Epistaxis:** Mild bleeding due to mucosal trauma or ulceration.
*   **Pain/Sneezing:** Due to local irritation.

**Clinical Implication:**
> **Dictum:** In any child presenting with **unilateral, foul-smelling, purulent nasal discharge**, a foreign body must be ruled out until proven otherwise,.

**Signs:**
*   **Anterior Rhinoscopy:** The object is often visible on the floor of the nose, usually between the [[Nasal Septum]] and the [[Inferior Turbinate]]. It may be obscured by edema, discharge, or granulation tissue.

### Diagnosis
1.  **Clinical History:** Clear history from parents or the child.
2.  **Diagnostic Nasal Endoscopy ([[DNE]]):** Highly useful to inspect deep cavities, confirm diagnosis, and locate non-visible FBs.
3.  **Radiology:**
    *   **X-ray PNS/Lateral View:** Useful only for **radiopaque** foreign bodies (metal, batteries),.
    *   Most organic/plastic objects are radiolucent and will not show up on X-ray.

### Management
Removal technique depends on the type of foreign body and patient cooperation.

**Methods of Removal:**
1.  **For Soft/Graspable Objects (Paper, Cotton, Sponge):** Removed using **crocodile forceps** or [[Tilley's Forceps]],.
2.  **For Smooth/Round/Solid Objects (Beads, Seeds):**
    *   **DO NOT** use forceps, as the object may slip and be pushed further back into the nasopharynx or aspirated.
    *   Use a **blunt hook** or a [[Eustachian Tube Catheter]]. Pass the instrument beyond the object and gently drag it forward along the floor of the nose,.
3.  **Suction:** Useful for removing secretions and smaller objects.
4.  **Fogarty Catheter:** Passed past the FB, balloon inflated, and pulled out.

**Anesthesia Considerations:**
*   **Cooperative Adults/Older Children:** Removal in OPD without anesthesia or with local anesthesia.
*   **Uncooperative Children/Impacted FB:** Removal under **General Anesthesia (GA)** is preferred to prevent trauma and aspiration,.
*   **Position:** Patient is placed in **Rose’s position** with a pack in the nasopharynx to prevent aspiration during removal under GA,.

**Special Consideration: Button Batteries**
*   Must be removed **immediately** to prevent chemical burns and septal perforation.

### Complications
If neglected or managed improperly:
*   **Rhinolith formation**.
*   **Sinusitis**.
*   **Inhalation/Aspiration:** Into the tracheobronchial tree.
*   **Septal Perforation** (especially with batteries).
*   **Tetanus** (rare).

# Rhinolith

### Definition
A [[Rhinolith]] is a stone (calculus) formed within the nasal cavity by the deposition of calcium and magnesium salts (carbonates and phosphates) around a nucleus,.

### Etiology and Pathogenesis
*   **Nucleus:** Can be **Exogenous** (foreign body like button, bead, cotton) or **Endogenous** (blood clot, inspissated mucus, ectopic tooth),.
*   **Deposition:** Slow deposition of salts occurs over years.
*   **Population:** More common in adults.

### Clinical Features
*   **Unilateral Nasal Obstruction**.
*   **Foul-smelling Discharge:** Unilateral, often purulent or blood-stained.
*   **Epistaxis:** Due to ulceration of surrounding mucosa.
*   **Pain:** Neuralgic pain or headache due to pressure.
*   **Cacosmia:** Subjective bad smell.

### Diagnosis
1.  **Anterior Rhinoscopy:** Reveals a **grey-brown** or **greenish-black**, irregular mass with a rough surface. It may be surrounded by granulation tissue.
2.  **Probing:** Characteristic **stony hard** feel with a **gritty sensation** (Probe Test),.
3.  **Radiology (X-ray/CT):** Appears as an irregular **radiopaque** shadow.

### Differential Diagnosis
*   Calcified [[Nasal Polyp]]
*   [[Osteoma]]
*   Malignancy (Carcinoma/Sarcoma)
*   Odontogenic tumors

### Treatment
*   **Removal:** Usually done under **General Anesthesia**.
*   **Technique:**
    *   Small rhinoliths: Removed anteriorly.
    *   Large rhinoliths: May need to be crushed into pieces (lithotripsy) and removed.
    *   Giant rhinoliths: May require **Lateral Rhinotomy** approach.

### Complications
*   Pressure necrosis of the septum (leading to perforation).
*   Pressure necrosis of the lateral wall.
*   [[Oroantral Fistula]].

# Nasal Myiasis (Maggots in Nose)

Although technically a foreign body (animate), it is a distinct clinical entity.

*   **Definition:** Infestation of nasal cavity by dipterous larvae (maggots).
*   **Causative Agent:** Usually *Chrysomya bezziana*.
*   **Predisposing Factors:** Flies are attracted to foul-smelling discharge. Seen in [[Atrophic Rhinitis]], Syphilis, Leprosy, or neglected wounds. Common in Aug–Oct in India.
*   **Symptoms:** Intense irritation, crawling sensation, sneezing, blood-stained discharge, facial pain, and distinctive foul smell.
*   **Treatment:**
    1.  **Kill Maggots:** Instill **Chloroform water** diluted with water or **Turpentine oil** inside the nose to anesthetize/kill larvae,.
    2.  **Removal:** Manual removal with forceps or suction.
    3.  **Hygiene:** Alkaline nasal douching to clear debris.
