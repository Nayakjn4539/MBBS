# Examination of the Lacrimal System

The examination of the lacrimal apparatus is primarily aimed at distinguishing between **Hyperlacrimation** (excessive tear production) and **Epiphora** (obstruction to tear drainage).

## 1. History Taking
A detailed history helps differentiate the etiology of a [[Watering eye]].
*   **Uniocular vs. Bilateral:** Bilateral often suggests allergy or systemic infection; unilateral suggests local obstruction or foreign body.
*   **Timing:** Watering during eating ([[Crocodile tears]]) suggests aberrant regeneration of the [[Facial nerve]].
*   **Discharge:** Mucopurulent discharge suggests [[Chronic Dacryocystitis]].
*   **Pain:** Painful swelling suggests [[Acute Dacryocystitis]] or [[Dacryoadenitis]].

## 2. External Examination (Inspection and Palpation)
A systematic inspection under diffuse light and magnification.

### Inspection
*   **Eyelids:** Look for [[Ectropion]] (punctum not in apposition with globe), [[Entropion]], or [[Trichiasis]] causing reflex hyperlacrimation.
*   **Lacrimal Puncta:** Check for position (eversion), size (stenosis), or absence (agenesis).
*   **Lacrimal Sac Area:** Look for swelling, redness, or fistula below the [[Medial palpebral ligament]].
*   **Lacrimal Gland:** Check for enlargement or prolapse in the superolateral orbit.

### Palpation and Regurgitation Test (ROPLAS)
*   **Procedure:** Apply steady pressure with the index finger over the [[Lacrimal sac]] area (just medial to the medial canthus) against the [[Lacrimal bone]].
*   **Observation:** Observe the [[Puncta]] for any reflux.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   **Positive:** Reflux of mucopurulent material indicates [[Chronic Dacryocystitis]] with obstruction at the [[Nasolacrimal duct]] or lower sac.
    *   **Negative:** Normal sac, or encysted [[Mucocele]], or patient emptied sac recently.

**Clinical Implication:** Never perform a regurgitation test or syringing in a case of **Acute Dacryocystitis** as it is painful and may spread infection, leading to [[Orbital cellulitis]].

## 3. Lacrimal Syringing
This is the standard clinical test to check the patency of the lacrimal drainage system.

**Procedure:**
1.  Topical anesthesia (e.g., 4% Xylocaine).
2.  Dilate the lower [[Punctum]] with a [[Nettleship punctum dilator]].
3.  Insert a [[Lacrimal cannula]] attached to a saline-filled syringe into the canaliculus (vertical then horizontal direction).
4.  Advance gently until it touches the medial wall of the sac (lacrimal bone).

### Interpretation of Syringing

| Observation | Inference |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Saline passes freely into nose/throat** | System Patent (No anatomical obstruction). |
| **Regurgitation from SAME punctum** | Obstruction in the same [[Canaliculus]]. |
| **Regurgitation from OPPOSITE punctum** | Obstruction in [[Common Canaliculus]] (if immediate) or [[Nasolacrimal Duct]] (if distension of sac noted). |
| **Hard Stop** (Cannula hits bone) | Canaliculi are patent; obstruction is distal (sac/NLD). |
| **Soft Stop** (Cannula hits soft tissue) | Obstruction is proximal (Canalicular block). |

## 4. Functional Tests (Jones Dye Tests)
These are indicated when the patient complains of watering despite a **patent** system on syringing (suspected functional block or pump failure).

### Jones Primary Test (Jones I)
Differentiates partial obstruction/pump failure from primary hypersecretion.
*   **Method:** Instill 2% [[Fluorescein dye]] into the conjunctival sac. Place a cotton bud soaked in anesthetic in the [[Inferior meatus]] of the nose.
*   **Wait:** 5 minutes.
*   **Results:**
    *   **Positive (Dye on cotton):** Patent drainage system. Cause of watering is **Hypersecretion**.
    *   **Negative (No dye):** Partial obstruction or Pump failure. Proceed to Jones II.

### Jones Secondary Test (Jones II)
Performed if Jones I is negative. It identifies the site of the partial block.
*   **Method:** Wash out the fluorescein from the conjunctiva. Perform [[Lacrimal syringing]] with clear saline.
*   **Results:**
    *   **Positive (Dye-stained saline comes out of nose):** Dye had entered the sac but couldn't drain. Diagnosis: **Partial obstruction** of [[Nasolacrimal Duct]].
    *   **Negative (Clear saline comes out of nose):** Dye never entered the sac. Diagnosis: **Upper lacrimal pump failure** or punctal/canalicular stenosis.

## 5. Other Diagnostic Tests

### Fluorescein Dye Disappearance Test (FDDT)
*   Instill fluorescein in both eyes.
*   Observe after 2-5 minutes.
*   **Normal:** Little to no dye remains.
*   **Abnormal:** Prolonged retention of dye in the [[Conjunctival sac]] indicates obstruction or atonia. Useful in children (unilateral tearing).

### Dacryocystography (DCG)
*   **Technique:** Injection of radio-opaque contrast (Lipiodol) into the canaliculi followed by X-ray images.
*   **Indication:** To visualize the anatomical site of the block, size of the sac, diverticula, or fistulas. Essential before performing [[Dacryocystorhinostomy]] (DCR) in complex cases.

### Dacryoscintillography
*   **Technique:** Instillation of a radioactive tracer (Technetium-99m) and tracking via gamma camera.
*   **Use:** Assesses the **physiological function** of tear drainage. Best for detecting functional blocks or pump failure.

## 6. Examination of Secretory System (Dry Eye Evaluation)
Though "watering" is the complaint, reflex tearing due to [[Dry eye]] must be ruled out.

*   **Schirmer’s Test I:** Measures total tear secretion (Reflex + Basal).
    *   Filter paper (Whatman No. 41) placed in lower fornix for 5 mins.
    *   **Normal:** >15 mm.
    *   **Severe Dry Eye:** <5 mm.
*   **Tear Film Break Up Time (TBUT):** Measures mucin/lipid layer stability.
    *   Stain with fluorescein, observe under cobalt blue light.
    *   **Normal:** >10 seconds.
    *   **Abnormal:** <10 seconds (indicates [[Evaporative Dry Eye]]).
