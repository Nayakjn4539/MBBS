# [[Cardiac Poisons]] > Nicotine

### [[Nicotine]] (Tobacco)

[[Nicotine]] is a potent toxic alkaloid found in the tobacco plant. It acts as a cardiac poison, a ganglionic stimulant, and a CNS depressant. While widely used recreationally, acute poisoning is a medical emergency due to its rapid onset and lethality.

#### Source and Composition
*   **Botanical Source:** Derived from the leaves of **[[Nicotiana tabacum]]** (common tobacco) and **[[Nicotiana rustica]]** (Turkish tobacco/wild tobacco).
*   **Potency:** *Nicotiana rustica* contains a higher concentration of nicotine compared to *Nicotiana tabacum*.
*   **Toxic Parts:** All parts of the plant are poisonous **except the ripe seeds**.
*   **Active Principles:**
    *   **Nicotine:** The primary toxic alkaloid (0.5–8% concentration in dried leaves).
    *   **Anabasine & Nornicotine:** Related toxic alkaloids.
    *   **Pyridine:** Present in tobacco smoke.
*   **Properties:** Pure nicotine is a colorless, odorless, hygroscopic, oily liquid. It turns brown and emits a characteristic unpleasant odor upon exposure to air. It has an acrid, burning taste.

#### Mode of Action
Nicotine acts primarily on the **[[Autonomic Nervous System]]** and the **[[Neuromuscular Junction]]**.
*   **Biphasic Action:** It initially **stimulates** and subsequently **depresses/blocks** the autonomic ganglia (both sympathetic and parasympathetic) and somatic neuromuscular junctions.
*   **CNS:** It stimulates the CNS (causing tremors/convulsions) followed by depression (causing respiratory paralysis).
*   **Cardiovascular:** Causes release of [[Catecholamines]] (adrenaline/noradrenaline), leading to vasoconstriction, tachycardia, and hypertension.

#### Pharmacokinetics
*   **Absorption:** Rapidly absorbed through mucous membranes (buccal, nasal), respiratory tract (lungs), GI tract, and **intact skin** (cutaneous absorption).
*   **Metabolism:** Primarily in the [[Liver]]; metabolites include cotinine.
*   **Excretion:** Via kidneys in urine; also excreted in saliva and breast milk.

### Clinical Features

#### 1. Acute Poisoning
Symptoms appear rapidly (within minutes).
**Mnemonic: "NICOTINE"**
*   **N**ausea and vomiting (due to vagal stimulation).
*   **I**ncreased salivation, sweating (cold clammy skin), and abdominal pain.
*   **C**onfusion, headache, and dizziness.
*   **O**cular changes: Pupils constricted (**[[Miosis]]**) initially, later dilated (**[[Mydriasis]]**) in terminal stages.
*   **T**remors, muscle fasciculations, and convulsions.
*   **I**rregular pulse: Initially **tachycardia** and **hypertension**, followed by **bradycardia** and **hypotension** (shock).
*   **N**ervous system depression: Stupor, coma.
*   **E**xpiratory failure: Labored breathing, respiratory muscle paralysis leading to **[[Respiratory Failure]]** (usual cause of death).

#### 2. Chronic Poisoning
Usually seen in chronic smokers or tobacco chewers.
*   **Tobacco Amblyopia:** Loss of vision/color blindness.
*   **Cardiovascular:** Angina pectoris, Buerger's disease (thromboangiitis obliterans), hypertension.
*   **Respiratory:** Chronic bronchitis, emphysema, lung cancer.
*   **Green Tobacco Sickness:** An occupational illness in tobacco harvesters caused by dermal absorption of nicotine from wet tobacco leaves. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and weakness.

### Fatal Dose and Period
| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fatal Dose (Pure Nicotine)** | **50 – 100 mg** (approx. 1 drop of pure liquid) |
| **Fatal Dose (Tobacco)** | **15 – 30 grams** of crude tobacco |
| **Fatal Period** | Very rapid: **5 to 15 minutes** |

> **Note:** An average cigarette contains 15–20 mg of nicotine, but only **1–2 mg** is absorbed systemically per cigarette smoked.

### Management of Poisoning

There is no specific antidote for nicotine in humans; treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

1.  **Decontamination:**
    *   **Skin:** If spilled on skin, remove clothing immediately and wash thoroughly with **soap and water** (nicotine is lipid-soluble).
    *   **Ingestion:** **[[Gastric Lavage]]** with warm water containing **activated charcoal**, tannic acid, or potassium permanganate (1:5000) to precipitate/adsorb the alkaloid. Scrub the mucosa to remove adherent particles.
    *   **Do NOT induce alkalinization:** Avoid alkaline fluids as they increase absorption.

2.  **Symptomatic Treatment:**
    *   **Respiratory Support:** Artificial respiration and oxygen inhalation are critical as death occurs due to respiratory muscle paralysis. Mechanical ventilation if necessary.
    *   **Convulsions:** Administer **[[Diazepam]]** or barbiturates.
    *   **Bradycardia/Secretions:** **[[Atropine]]** is given to control excessive bronchial secretions and counteract bradycardia.
    *   **Hypotension:** Fluids and vasopressors (e.g., noradrenaline).
    *   **Excretion:** Acidification of urine (using ammonium chloride) may enhance excretion, but is risky if rhabdomyolysis is present.

### Postmortem Findings

**External Findings:**
*   Signs of **[[Asphyxia]]**.
*   **Brownish froth** at the mouth and nostrils.
*   Characteristic smell of stale tobacco/nicotine.

**Internal Findings:**
*   **GI Tract:** Congestion of gastric mucosa; stomach contents may contain tobacco fragments (brownish fluid) with a characteristic pungent odor.
*   **Respiratory:** Pulmonary edema; congestion of lungs, trachea, and bronchi.
*   **Heart:** Subendocardial hemorrhages may be seen.

### Medicolegal Aspects

1.  **Accidental Poisoning:** Most common.
    *   Children accidentally eating cigarettes or drinking insecticide solutions.
    *   Application of tobacco juice/leaves on wounds or skin for "cures".
    *   **Green Tobacco Sickness** in farmers.
2.  **Suicidal:** Rare, usually using nicotine-based insecticides.
3.  **Homicidal:** Rare due to strong odor and taste, but historically used (extracts put in food/drink).
4.  **Malingering (Fictitious illness):**
    *   Prisoners or soldiers may place tobacco leaves soaked in water in their **axilla** (armpit) or rectum. This causes symptoms like tachycardia, tremors, and sickness to avoid duty or gain hospital admission.
5.  **Cattle Poisoning:** Used occasionally to kill cattle.
