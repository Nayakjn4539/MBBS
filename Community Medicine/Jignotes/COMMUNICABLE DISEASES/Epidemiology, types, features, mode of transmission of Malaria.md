# **EPIDEMIOLOGY OF MALARIA**

[[Malaria]] is a protozoal disease caused by infection with parasites of the genus *Plasmodium* and transmitted to man by certain species of infected female *Anopheles* mosquito. It is characterized by fever with rigors, anemia, and splenomegaly.

### **1. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DETERMINANTS (The Triad)**

#### **A. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** Protozoa of genus *Plasmodium*.
    *   **[[Plasmodium vivax]]:** Most widely distributed; causes Benign Tertian Malaria. Relapses occur due to hypnozoites (dormant liver stage),.
    *   **[[Plasmodium falciparum]]:** Most serious/fatal form; causes Malignant Tertian Malaria. Prevalent in tribal/forest areas and North-East India,.
    *   **[[Plasmodium malariae]]:** Causes Quartan Malaria. Associated with long-term recrudescence (up to 40 years),.
    *   **[[Plasmodium ovale]]:** Rare in India; similar to *P. vivax*.
    *   **[[Plasmodium knowlesi]]:** A zoonotic malaria (found in monkeys), reported in SE Asia and Andaman & Nicobar islands,.
*   **Life Cycle:**
    *   **Human Cycle (Asexual):** Called [[Schizogony]]. Occurs in liver (pre-erythrocytic) and RBCs (erythrocytic),.
    *   **Mosquito Cycle (Sexual):** Called [[Sporogony]]. Occurs in the mosquito gut. Mosquito is the **Definitive Host**; Man is the **Intermediate Host**.

#### **B. Host Factors**
*   **Reservoir:** A human harboring sexual forms ([[gametocytes]]) in the blood is the reservoir.
    *   A child is epidemiologically a better reservoir than an adult.
    *   **Threshold:** A person must harbor both sexes of gametocytes, mature and viable, in sufficient density (approx. 12/cubic mm) to infect mosquitoes.
*   **Immunity:**
    *   Infants have resistance to *P. falciparum* due to fetal hemoglobin (HbF).
    *   **Sickle Cell Trait (HbS):** Confers protection against severe *P. falciparum* malaria.
    *   **Duffy Negative RBCs:** Resistant to *P. vivax* infection.

#### **C. Environmental Factors**
*   **Temperature:** Optimum 20°C to 30°C. Parasite development ceases below 16°C.
*   **Humidity:** Relative humidity of **60%** is necessary for the mosquito to live its normal span.
*   **Rainfall:** Provides breeding grounds; epidemics often follow rains.
*   **Altitude:** Rare above 2000–2500 meters.

### **2. VECTORS OF MALARIA (In India)**

There are about 45 species of Anopheles in India, but only a few are major vectors.

| Vector Species | Habitat/Distribution | Breeding Habits |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Anopheles culicifacies]]** | **Rural** & Peri-urban | Rainwater pools, irrigation channels, river beds,. |
| **[[Anopheles stephensi]]** | **Urban** areas | **Man-made containers**: Wells, overhead tanks, cisterns, coolers,. |
| **[[Anopheles fluviatilis]]** | Hilly/Forest areas | Moving water, streams (Highly anthropophilic),. |
| **[[Anopheles sundaicus]]** | Coastal areas | Brackish water,. |

**Mnemonic for Vectors:**
*   **C**ulicifacies = **C**ountryside (Rural)
*   **S**tephensi = **C**ity (Urban)
*   **F**luviatilis = **F**low (Moving water/Hills)

### **3. MODES OF TRANSMISSION**

1.  **Vector Transmission:** Bite of an infective female *Anopheles* mosquito. Injecting **[[sporozoites]]** (infective stage).
2.  **Direct Transmission:**
    *   **Blood Transfusion:** "Trophozoite induced malaria." Incubation period is short; no relapse occurs,.
    *   **Contaminated Needles:** Common among drug addicts.
    *   **Organ Transplant**.
3.  **Congenital Malaria:** From infected mother to newborn across the placenta (rare).

---

### **4. INCUBATION PERIODS**

The time between the infective bite and the first appearance of clinical signs.

| Species | Incubation Period (Days) |
| :--- | :--- |
| *P. falciparum* | **12** (Range 9–14) |
| *P. vivax* | **14** (Range 8–17) |
| *P. ovale* | **17** (Range 16–18) |
| *P. malariae* | **28** (Range 18–40) |

**Mnemonic for IP:**
*   **Falciparum** is **F**ast (Shortest ~12 days).
*   **Malariae** takes a **M**onth (~28 days).

### **5. CLINICAL FEATURES**

**A. Typical Malaria Attack (Febrile Paroxysm)**
Typically consists of three stages,:
1.  **Cold Stage:** Lassitude, headache, intense shivering/rigors. Temperature rises rapidly (39–41°C). Lasts 15 min to 1 hour.
2.  **Hot Stage:** Patient feels burning hot, skin dry, intense headache. Pulse full and rapid. Lasts 2–6 hours.
3.  **Sweating Stage:** Profuse sweating, temperature drops rapidly, patient feels relieved/exhausted. Lasts 2–4 hours.

**B. Periodicity of Fever**
*   **Tertian (48 hours):** *P. vivax, P. falciparum, P. ovale*.
*   **Quartan (72 hours):** *P. malariae*.

**C. [[Severe Malaria]] (Complicated Malaria)**
Primarily caused by *P. falciparum*. Defined by one or more of the following,:
*   **Cerebral Malaria:** Unarousable coma, convulsions.
*   **Severe Anemia:** Hb < 5 g/dl.
*   **Renal Failure:** Serum creatinine > 3 mg/dl.
*   **[[Blackwater Fever]]:** Hemoglobinuria (dark red/black urine) due to massive intravascular hemolysis.
*   **Hypoglycemia:** Glucose < 40 mg/dl.
*   **Shock:** Systolic BP < 80 mmHg (Algid malaria).
*   **ARDS:** Pulmonary edema.

### **6. MALARIOMETRIC INDICES (Measurement)**

*   **[[Annual Parasite Incidence]] (API):** (Confirmed cases in 1 year / Population under surveillance) × 1000. It is the most sophisticated measure of malaria incidence.
*   **Annual Blood Examination Rate (ABER):** Indicator of operational efficiency. Target should be >10%,.
*   **Slide Positivity Rate (SPR):** Percentage of slides found positive. High SPR indicates an impending outbreak.
*   **Infant Parasite Rate (IPR):** Most sensitive index of *recent* transmission in a locality.

---

### **7. DIAGNOSIS & TREATMENT (Brief)**

*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   **Microscopy:** Gold standard. **Thick smear** for detection (Sensitivity), **Thin smear** for species identification (Specificity).
    *   **Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT):** Detects antigens (HRP-2 for *Pf*, pLDH for others).
*   **Treatment Guidelines (India):**
    *   **P. vivax:** [[Chloroquine]] (3 days) + [[Primaquine]] (14 days for radical cure/anti-relapse).
    *   **P. falciparum:** [[Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy]] (ACT).
        *   NE States: ACT-AL (Artemether + Lumefantrine).
        *   Other States: ACT-SP (Artesunate + Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine).
        *   Plus single dose Primaquine on Day 2.

> **Clinical Relevance:** **Primaquine** is contraindicated in pregnancy, infants, and G6PD deficiency due to risk of hemolysis.
