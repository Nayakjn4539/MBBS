# [[NUTRITION AND HEALTH]] > Food fortification

### Definition
The WHO defines **Food Fortification** as the process whereby nutrients are added to foods (in relatively small quantities) to maintain or improve the quality of the diet of a group, a community, or a population.

It is a **Public Health measure** aimed at reinforcing the usual dietary intake of nutrients to prevent or control nutritional disorders. It acts as a [[Primary Prevention]] strategy.

### Criteria for Food Fortification
For a fortification program to be successful, the chosen food vehicle and the nutrient must fulfill specific criteria:

1.  **Vehicle Consumption:** The vehicle (food) fortified must be consumed consistently as part of the regular daily diet by the relevant sections of the population.
2.  **Safety & Effectiveness:** The amount of nutrient added must provide an effective supplement for *low consumers* without contributing a hazardous excess to *high consumers*.
3.  **Organoleptic Properties:** The addition of the nutrient should **not** cause any noticeable change in **taste, smell, appearance, or consistency**.
4.  **Affordability:** The cost of fortification must not raise the price of the food beyond the reach of the population in greatest need.

**Mnemonic for Criteria: "COST"**
*   **C**onsistency (No change in taste/look)
*   **O**ptimal amount (Safe and effective)
*   **S**table consumption (Eaten regularly)
*   **T**otal Price (Must be affordable)

### Examples of Food Fortification in India

The following are programmes of demonstrated effectiveness in India:

| Food Vehicle | Nutrient Added | Disease/Condition Prevented | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Common Salt** | [[Iodine]] (Potassium Iodate) | [[Endemic Goitre]] / IDD | Most convenient and effective method. Standard: 30 ppm at production, 15 ppm at consumer level. |
| **Water** | [[Fluorine]] | Dental Caries | Recommended where natural fluoride is low (<0.5 mg/L). |
| **Vanaspati** | [[Vitamin A]] & [[Vitamin D]] | Xerophthalmia / Rickets | Mandatory fortification in India. |
| **Salt** | [[Iron]] + [[Iodine]] | Anemia + IDD | Known as **Double Fortified Salt (DFS)**. |

### Specific Fortification Standards

#### 1. Vanaspati (Hydrogenated Fat)
Since Vanaspati loses vitamins during hydrogenation, it is mandatory by government regulation to fortify it.
*   **Vitamin A:** 2500 IU per 100 grams.
*   **Vitamin D:** 175 IU per 100 grams.

#### 2. Double Fortified Salt (DFS) / Twin Fortified Salt
Developed by the **National Institute of Nutrition (NIN)**, Hyderabad, as a long-term strategy to combat [[Iron Deficiency Anemia]] and [[Iodine Deficiency Disorders]].
*   **Components:** Salt + Potassium Iodate + Ferrous Sulphate + Sodium Hexametaphosphate (stabilizer).
*   **Provides:** **40 mcg Iodine** and **1 mg Iron** per gram of salt.

#### 3. Bio-fortification
This involves conventional breeding methods, molecular breeding, and genetic engineering to improve the nutrient profile of crops.
*   **Example:** **Harvest Plus** initiative.
*   **Golden Rice:** Genetically modified to be rich in $\beta$-carotene and iron.

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Nutritional Blindness:** Controlled via Vit A fortified Vanaspati/Milk.
*   **Goitre:** Controlled via Iodized Salt.
*   **Dental Caries:** Prevented by fluoridation (0.5–0.8 mg/L is optimal in India).
*   **Anemia:** Addressed via Iron fortification of salt or wheat flour.
