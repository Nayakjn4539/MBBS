# [[Sexual Jurisprudence]] > Sodomy

### Definition and Terminology
**[[Sodomy]]** is defined as sexual intercourse per anum (anal intercourse) between two human beings (usually male-male, but can be male-female).

*   **Synonyms:**
    *   **Buggery:** Often used interchangeably in law; historically implies anal intercourse with man, woman, or animal.
    *   **Greek Love:** Historical term referring to homosexuality.
    *   **Pederasty:** Anal intercourse specifically with a young boy.

### Classification of Participants
In the act of sodomy, two individuals are involved:
1.  **Active Agent:** The person performing the act (inserting the penis). Also known as the **Sodomist** or **Pederast**.
2.  **Passive Agent:** The person on whom the act is performed (receiving the penis). Also known as the **Catamite** or **Pathic** or **Kinsey**.

### Medical Examination of the Victim (Passive Agent)
The examination aims to find evidence of anal penetration and force. The findings depend heavily on whether the victim is accustomed to the act (Habitual) or if it is a recent/forcible event (Non-habitual).

**Requirements:**
*   **Consent:** Written informed consent is mandatory.
*   **Position:** [[Lithotomy position]] or **Genu-pectoral position** (Knee-Elbow position) is best for examination. > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> patient in knee-elbow position for anal examination

#### 1. Signs in Acute / Recent / Non-Habitual Sodomy
These signs are seen in victims of forcible sodomy or first-time indulgence.
*   **Physical Behaviour:** The victim may have difficulty walking or sitting due to pain.
*   **Anal Sphincter:** The sphincter is usually **tight** and in **spasm** due to pain.
*   **Injuries:**
    *   **Abrasions/Bruises:** Present on the anal mucosa, perianal skin, and buttocks.
    *   **Fissures:** Radial fissures or tears may be seen. A **triangular tear** at the posterior anal margin (6 o'clock position) is characteristic.
    *   **Tyre Sign:** Perianal hematoma causing obliteration of anal skin folds.
*   **Tenderness:** Marked tenderness on examination.
*   **Discharges:** Blood, semen, or lubricant may be present around the anus.
*   **Perianal Rugae:** Rugae are prominent and distinct.

#### 2. Signs in Chronic / Habitual Passive Agent
These signs develop over time due to repeated anal intercourse.
*   **Anal Sphincter:**
    *   **Loss of Tone:** The sphincter is relaxed, hypotonic, and patulous (gaping).
    *   **Lateral Traction Test:** When buttocks are pulled laterally, the anal sphincter **opens/gapes** instead of contracting, and the rectal mucosa may become visible. > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Lateral traction test showing gaping anus
*   **Funnel-Shaped Anus:** The anus appears deeply set, forming a funnel-shaped depression (infundibulum) due to the absorption of perianal fat and hypertrophy of the glutei.
*   **Anal Mucosa:**
    *   **Smoothness:** The perianal skin and mucosa become smooth, thick, and keratinized.
    *   **Loss of Rugae:** The normal radiating folds (rugae) disappear or are flattened (so-called "ironing out" of rugae).
*   **Reflex Relaxation:** Upon touching the perianal skin or introducing a finger, the sphincter **relaxes** instead of contracting (loss of anal reflex).
*   **Associated Pathologies:** Old healed scars (cicatrix), anal warts (condylomata), fissures, or hemorrhoids (piles) may be present.
*   **Shaving:** Perianal hair might be shaved.

#### Table: Differences between Non-Habitual and Habitual Passive Agents

| Feature | Non-Habitual / Acute Sodomy | Habitual Passive Agent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sphincter Tone** | Tight, spastic | Relaxed, patulous, loose |
| **Anal Reflex** | Present (constricts on touch) | Absent or Paradoxical (dilates/relaxes) |
| **Mucosa/Skin** | Rugose, folded | Smooth, thickened, keratinized |
| **Shape** | Normal | **Funnel-shaped** depression |
| **Injuries** | Acute tears, bleeding, inflammation | Old scars, piles, fissures, warts |
| **Pain** | Painful and tender | Usually painless |
| **Semen** | Often present | May be present |

### Examination of the Accused (Active Agent)
Findings are often minimal or absent in the active partner.
1.  **General Evidence:** Signs of struggle (scratches, bite marks on face/hands) if non-consensual.
2.  **Genital Examination:**
    *   **Smell:** The penis may smell of **feces** or peculiar anal gland odor.
    *   **Trace Evidence:** Presence of **fecal matter**, **lubricants**, or **rectal mucosal cells** on the glans penis or under the prepuce.
    *   **Injuries:** Abrasions on the glans or tearing of the **frenulum** may occur due to tight anal sphincter resistance.
    *   **Infections:** Check for [[Sexually Transmitted Diseases]] (STDs) like Gonorrhea, Syphilis, or HIV.

### Collection of Evidence
Specimens must be collected, labeled, and sealed for Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) analysis:
1.  **Swabs:**
    *   **Anal Swabs:** Two swabs (one dry, one wet with saline) from the anal canal/rectum to detect semen/sperm.
    *   **Perineal Swabs:** To detect saliva or lubricants.
2.  **Smears:** Slides prepared from the anal canal to look for spermatozoa.
3.  **Clothing:** Undergarments of both victim and accused for seminal stains, blood, or fecal stains.
4.  **Hair:** Combing of pubic hair for foreign hair; cutting of matted hair.
5.  **Blood & Urine:** For alcohol/drug analysis (if facilitated sexual assault is suspected) and DNA profiling.

### Medico-Legal Aspects (India)
1.  **Legal Section:** [[Section 377 IPC]] (Unnatural Offences):
    *   Defined as "carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal."
    *   **Current Status:** Consensual sex between adults of the same sex was decriminalized (Navtej Singh Johar case), but **non-consensual sodomy** and sodomy with **minors** remain punishable offenses.
2.  **Penetration:** Penetration is sufficient to constitute the carnal intercourse necessary to the offense described in this section. Ejaculation is **not** essential.
3.  **Proof:** The presence of spermatozoa or semen in the anal canal is the strongest corroborative evidence but is not legally mandatory if penetration can be proved otherwise (e.g., injury patterns).
4.  **Divorce:** Sodomy by a husband on his wife without her consent is a ground for divorce (cruelty).

### Mnemonics
**Habitual Sodomy Signs: "F-L-A-S-H"**
*   **F** - **F**unnel shaped anus
*   **L** - **L**ax sphincter (Patulous)
*   **A** - **A**bsent anal reflex (Reflex relaxation)
*   **S** - **S**mooth skin (Loss of rugae)
*   **H** - **H**ealed scars / Hemorrhoids
