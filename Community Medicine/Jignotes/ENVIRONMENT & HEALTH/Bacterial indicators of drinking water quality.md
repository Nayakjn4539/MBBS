# Bacterial Indicators of Drinking Water Quality

Ideally, drinking water should be free from all pathogenic organisms. However, directly testing for specific pathogens (like *Salmonella* or *Vibrio*) is difficult, time-consuming, and unreliable because they are present in small numbers and are fragile.

Therefore, we look for **[[Bacteriological Indicators]]**. These are non-pathogenic bacteria normally present in the human intestine. Their presence in water indicates **[[Faecal Contamination]]**, implying that pathogens might also be present.

### Criteria for an Ideal Indicator Organism
1.  **Abundance:** Should be present in much larger numbers than pathogens in human feces.
2.  **Resistance:** Should survive longer in the environment than pathogens.
3.  **Source:** Should be exclusively of fecal origin.
4.  **Detection:** Should be easily, rapidly, and reliably detected by simple laboratory tests.
5.  **Resistance to Chlorine:** Should have greater resistance to purification processes than pathogens.

### The Three Main Indicators

#### 1. [[Coliform Organisms]] (The Primary Indicator)
This group includes aerobic and facultative anaerobic, Gram-negative, non-sporing, motile, and non-motile rods capable of fermenting lactose with acid and gas production at 37°C within 48 hours.
*   **Significance:** It is the standard indicator used worldwide.
*   **Types:**
    *   **[[Escherichia coli]] (E. coli):** The most important indicator. It is of **fecal origin**. Its presence is strong evidence of recent fecal pollution.
    *   **Klebsiella aerogenes:** Can be of non-fecal origin (found in soil/vegetation). Its presence alone does not necessarily prove fecal contamination.
*   **Reason for selection:** An average person excretes 200–400 billion coliforms/day. They are foreign to potable water; hence, their detection signals a breakdown in the sanitation barrier.

#### 2. [[Faecal Streptococci]] (Enterococci)
*   **Significance:** They regularly occur in feces but in smaller numbers than *E. coli*.
*   **Clinical Value:** They succumb to natural purification forces rapidly. Therefore, their presence indicates **[[Recent Contamination]]**.
*   **Utility:** Useful for confirming doubtful cases.

#### 3. [[Clostridium perfringens]]
*   **Significance:** These are spore-forming organisms.
*   **Clinical Value:** Spores are highly resistant and survive in water/soil much longer than coliforms. Their presence indicates **[[Remote Contamination]]** (Old/Past pollution) or intermittent contamination.
*   **Resistance:** They resist chlorination at doses that normally kill vegetative bacteria.

### Summary of Indicators

| Indicator Organism | Significance/Interpretation | Resistance to Disinfection |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[E. coli]]** | **Specific indicator of fecal pollution**. Indicates potential presence of enteric pathogens. | Moderate |
| **[[Faecal Streptococci]]** | Confirmatory evidence. Indicates **RECENT** pollution. | Low (Die rapidly) |
| **[[Clostridium perfringens]]** | Indicates **REMOTE (OLD)** pollution. | High (Due to spores) |
| **Colony Count** | Estimates general bacterial purity (not specific). Sudden rise indicates pollution. | Variable |

### WHO Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality

For water to be considered safe for human consumption, it must meet the following bacteriological standards:

| Water Source | Bacteriological Quality (Standard) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **All water intended for drinking** | **[[E. coli]] or Thermotolerant coliforms** must not be detectable in any **100 ml** sample. |
| **Treated water entering distribution** | **E. coli or Total coliforms** must not be detectable in any **100 ml** sample. |
| **Treated water in distribution system** | **E. coli or Thermotolerant coliforms** must not be detectable in any **100 ml** sample. |

> **Note:** In large supplies, total coliform bacteria must not be present in 95% of samples taken throughout any 12-month period.

### Methods of Detection

1.  **[[Presumptive Coliform Test]] (Multiple Tube Method):**
    *   Uses **McConkey’s Lactose Bile Salt Broth**.
    *   Estimates the **Most Probable Number (MPN)** of coliforms per 100 ml.
    *   **Positive Result:** Acid and Gas production after 48 hours.

2.  **[[Eijkman Test]] (Confirmatory Test):**
    *   Differentiates fecal *E. coli* from non-fecal coliforms.
    *   Incubated at **44°C**. Only *E. coli* produces gas from lactose at this temperature.

3.  **[[Membrane Filtration Technique]]:**
    *   Water is filtered through a cellulose ester membrane. Bacteria are retained and cultured.
    *   **Advantage:** Gives results more rapidly (within 20 hours) compared to MPN (72–96 hours).

4.  **Colony Count:**
    *   Done on nutrient agar at 37°C and 22°C. Provides an estimate of general bacterial purity.

### Mnemonics for Exam

**1. To remember the contamination timeline:**
*   "**S**treptococci are **S**peedy" = They die fast, so presence means **Recent** contamination.
*   "**C**lostridium are **C**hronic" = Spores last long, so presence means **Remote/Old** contamination.

**2. To remember WHO Standards:**
*   "**Zero Tolerance for E. coli**" = 0 in 100 ml for all types of drinking water.

### Clinical Relevance
The detection of these indicators is the cornerstone of public health engineering to prevent **[[Water-borne diseases]]** such as:
*   Viral: Hepatitis A, Hepatitis E, Poliomyelitis.
*   Bacterial: Cholera, Typhoid, Bacillary Dysentery.
*   Protozoal: Amoebiasis, Giardiasis.
