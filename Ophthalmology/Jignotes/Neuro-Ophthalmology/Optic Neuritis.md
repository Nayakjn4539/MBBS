# [[Optic Neuritis]] (Typical vs Atypical)

**Optic Neuritis** refers to the inflammation of the [[optic nerve]]. It is a broad term encompassing inflammatory, demyelinating, and infectious disorders affecting the nerve. It is clinically classified based on ophthalmoscopic appearance and etiology.

### Anatomical Classification
1.  **[[Papillitis]]:** Involvement of the optic disc (intraocular part).
    *   **Fundus:** Hyperemia of the disc, blurred margins, obliteration of the physiological cup, and splinter hemorrhages.
    *   **Epidemiology:** Most common in children.
2.  **[[Retrobulbar Neuritis]]:** Involvement of the optic nerve behind the eyeball (retrolaminar part).
    *   **Fundus:** usually appears **Normal**.
    *   **Clinical dictum:** "Neither the patient sees nor the doctor sees anything" (Patient has visual loss, doctor sees a normal fundus).
    *   **Epidemiology:** Most common in adults, frequently associated with [[Multiple Sclerosis]].
3.  **[[Neuroretinitis]]:** [[Papillitis]] associated with inflammation of the surrounding retina, characterized by a **macular star** (hard exudates).

### Typical Optic Neuritis
Traditionally refers to optic neuritis associated with demyelinating disorders, specifically [[Multiple Sclerosis]] (MS).

**Clinical Features:**
*   **Age/Sex:** Young adults (18–45 years); Females > Males.
*   **Laterality:** Usually **Unilateral**.
*   **Vision Loss:** Sudden, progressive monocular visual loss worsening over hours to days (max deficit by 1 week).
*   **Pain:** Deep retro-orbital pain, characteristically **aggravated by ocular movements** (due to the attachment of the superior rectus muscle sheath to the optic nerve sheath).
*   **Color Vision:** Severely impaired, often out of proportion to visual acuity loss. **Red desaturation** is typical.
*   **Pupils:** [[Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect]] ([[RAPD]] / Marcus Gunn Pupil) is the earliest sign.
*   **Visual Fields:** **Central scotoma** is the most common defect.

**Specific Signs:**
1.  **[[Uhthoff's Phenomenon]]:** Worsening of vision with a rise in body temperature (e.g., after exercise, hot bath).
2.  **[[Pulfrich Phenomenon]]:** Altered perception of moving objects (statokinetic dissociation) due to asymmetric conduction delay between the two optic nerves.

### Atypical Optic Neuritis
Refers to optic neuritis not associated with demyelination or presenting with unusual features.

**Red Flags for Atypical Optic Neuritis:**
*   **Age:** < 12 years or > 50 years.
*   **Laterality:** Bilateral simultaneous onset.
*   **Pain:** Severe disabling pain or complete absence of pain.
*   **Course:** Progressive visual loss beyond 2 weeks or failure to recover after 4–6 weeks.
*   **Fundus:** Severe disc swelling, hemorrhages, or retinal exudates (macular star).

**Etiology of Atypical Cases:**
*   **Infectious:** Viral (Measles, Mumps, Chickenpox), Bacterial (TB, Syphilis, Cat-scratch disease), Protozoal (Toxoplasmosis).
*   **Autoimmune:** [[Sarcoidosis]], [[Systemic Lupus Erythematosus]] (SLE), [[Wegener's Granulomatosis]].
*   **[[Neuromyelitis Optica]] (Devic’s Disease):** Bilateral optic neuritis + Transverse myelitis. Associated with **Anti-Aquaporin 4 (AQP4)** antibodies.

### Comparison: Typical vs. Atypical Optic Neuritis

| Feature | Typical Optic Neuritis | Atypical Optic Neuritis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Etiology** | Demyelinating ([[Multiple Sclerosis]]) | Infectious, Autoimmune, NMO |
| **Age** | Young Adults (20–45 yrs) | Children (<12) or Older (>50) |
| **Laterality** | Unilateral | Often Bilateral (e.g., in children/NMO) |
| **Pain** | Mild, worse on eye movement | Absent or Severe/Continuous |
| **Disc Appearance** | Normal (Retrobulbar) or Mild Papillitis | Marked Edema, Neuroretinitis |
| **Visual Recovery** | Good (Spontaneous) | Variable/Poor without specific Rx |
| **Response to Steroids** | Speeds recovery, outcome unchanged | Often steroid-dependent or responsive |

### Investigations

**1. Magnetic Resonance Imaging ([[MRI]]):**
*   **Orbit & Brain (Gadolinium-enhanced):** Investigation of choice.
*   **Findings:** Increased signal intensity/swelling of the optic nerve. In MS, periventricular white matter plaques may be seen.

**2. Visual Evoked Potential ([[VEP]]):**
*   Shows **reduced amplitude** and **delayed P100 latency** (hallmark of demyelination).

**3. Specific Labs (for Atypical cases):**
*   ESR, CRP, ANA (Autoimmune).
*   NMO-IgG (Anti-AQP4) for Neuromyelitis Optica.
*   VDRL/FTA-ABS (Syphilis), Mantoux/Chest X-ray (TB).

### Management

**Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT) Guidelines:**

1.  **IV Methylprednisolone:**
    *   **Dose:** 1 gm/day IV for 3 days.
    *   **Followed by:** Oral Prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) for 11 days.
    *   **Indication:** Hastens visual recovery and delays the onset of [[Multiple Sclerosis]] for 2 years (in patients with MRI lesions). It does **not** change the final visual outcome.

2.  **Oral Steroids Alone:**
    *   **Clinical Implication:** **CONTRAINDICATED.** The ONTT study showed that oral prednisone alone increases the rate of **recurrence** of optic neuritis.

3.  **Disease Modifying Therapy:**
    *   Interferon beta-1a / Glatiramer acetate: Indicated if MRI shows demyelinating lesions to prevent progression to MS (CHAMPS study).
