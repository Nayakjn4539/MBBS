# [[Legal Procedures]] > Inquest

### Definition
[[Inquest]] is a legal or judicial inquiry to ascertain the cause of death in cases where the death is unnatural, suspicious, or unexpected. It investigates the **cause** and **manner** of death.

### Types of Inquest
In India, there are currently two types of inquests:
1.  **Police Inquest**
2.  **Magistrate's Inquest**

*(Note: Coroner's inquest was abolished in India in 1999, though practiced in the UK. The Medical Examiner system exists in the USA and Japan)*.

### 1. Police Inquest
This is the most common type of inquest conducted in India.

*   **Legal Section:** Conducted under **Section 174 of Cr.P.C.** (Criminal Procedure Code). Under the new **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS)**, this corresponds to **Section 194**.
*   **Authority:** An officer in charge of a police station or an Investigating Officer (IO) not below the rank of a **Head Constable**.
*   **Procedure:**
    *   Upon receiving information of an unnatural death (suicide, murder, accident, etc.), the officer informs the Executive Magistrate.
    *   The officer proceeds to the scene of the crime.
    *   The inquiry is held in the presence of two or more respectable inhabitants of the locality known as **'Panchas'**.
    *   The officer prepares a report describing the wounds, fractures, bruises, and other marks of injury, stating in what manner or by what weapon such marks appear to have been inflicted.
*   **Report:** This report is called the **'Panchnama'** or Inquest Report. It is signed by the police officer and the Panchas.
*   **Outcome:** If there is any doubt regarding the cause of death, or if it is a homicide/suicide, the body is sent to the nearest authorized [[Medical Officer]] for a [[Medicolegal Autopsy]].

### 2. Magistrate's Inquest
This is an inquiry conducted by a Magistrate, which is considered superior to a police inquest.

*   **Legal Section:** Conducted under **Section 176 of Cr.P.C.**. Under the new **BNSS**, this corresponds to **Section 196**.
*   **Authority:**
    1.  **Judicial Magistrate:** Required for specific grave offenses (e.g., custodial rape, custodial death, disappearance in custody).
    2.  **Executive Magistrate:** District Magistrate (Collector), Sub-divisional Magistrate (RDO), or Tehsildar.
*   **Indications:** A Magistrate's inquest is **mandatory** in the following cases:
    1.  **Death in Police Custody:** While under interrogation or lock-up.
    2.  **Death due to Police Firing.**
    3.  **Exhumation** (Digging out a buried body).
    4.  **Dowry Deaths:** Death of a woman within 7 years of marriage in suspicious circumstances (Section 304B IPC).
    5.  **Psychiatric Hospital Deaths:** Death of an inmate in a psychiatric hospital/nursing home.
    6.  **Allegation of Rape in Custody.**

**Mnemonic for Magistrate Inquest Indications: "DEPTHS"**
*   **D**owry death
*   **E**xhumation
*   **P**olice Firing
*   **T**reatment (Psychiatric hospital death)
*   **H**omicide/Death in Custody
*   **S**exual offence in Custody

### Other Systems (Not in India)

*   **Coroner's Inquest:** Previously used in Mumbai/Kolkata (abolished 1999). A Coroner is a special legal officer (need not be a doctor) with judicial powers to hold an inquiry with a jury.
*   **Medical Examiner System:** Practiced in the USA, Japan, and Canada. A [[Medical Examiner]] is a forensic pathologist with judicial authority to visit the scene, investigate, conduct autopsy, and determine the cause of death. This is considered the **superior system** scientifically.

### Medicolegal Aspects for the Doctor

1.  **Receipt of Papers:** A doctor should not conduct an autopsy without a proper requisition letter and a copy of the Inquest Report from the Police or Magistrate.
2.  **Reading the Inquest:** The medical officer *must* read the inquest report carefully before starting the autopsy to understand the alleged cause of death and history. However, the doctor should not be biased by the police findings.
3.  **Discrepancies:** If the injuries found on the body during autopsy differ significantly from those mentioned in the inquest report (Panchnama), the doctor should show these to the Investigating Officer (IO) to allow for corrections or explanations.
4.  **Exhumation:** Only a Magistrate can order an [[Exhumation]]. A police officer cannot order exhumation.
5.  **Dowry Death:** If a woman dies within 7 years of marriage under suspicious circumstances, the inquest *must* be conducted by a Magistrate, and the autopsy is preferably done by a board of two doctors.
