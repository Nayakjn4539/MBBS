# [[Pregnancy And Infant Deaths]] > Battered Baby Syndrome

# Battered Baby Syndrome

**Synonyms:** [[Non-accidental injury]] (NAI) of childhood, [[Caffey's syndrome]], Maltreatment syndrome, Parent-infant traumatic stress syndrome.

### Definition
A **Battered Child** is defined as one who has received repetitive physical injuries of a non-accidental nature, which are likely to have occurred at the hands of a parent or guardian.
*   **Defined by:** Henry Kempe in 1962.
*   **Age group:** Usually under 3 years of age (often unable to communicate).

---

### Epidemiology and Predisposing Factors
**The Child:**
*   Usually an infant or toddler (< 3 years).
*   Often illegitimate, unwanted, or premature.
*   Children with incessant crying or feeding difficulties.
*   Handicapped or mentally retarded children.

**The Abuser:**
*   Usually the parents (step-parents or biological).
*   Young, immature parents with low socio-economic status.
*   History of drug abuse, alcoholism, or unstable marriage.
*   History of being abused themselves as children ("Cycle of violence").

### Clinical Features and Injuries
The injuries are often multiple, of varying ages, and inconsistent with the history provided.

#### 1. Surface Injuries (Skin)
*   **Bruises:**
    *   **Multiplicity:** Multiple bruises seen on the face, buttocks, back, and thighs.
    *   **Different Ages:** Presence of fresh red bruises alongside fading yellow/brown bruises indicates repetitive trauma.
    *   **Patterned Bruises:**
        *   **Slap marks:** Parallel linear bruises on cheeks.
        *   **Grip marks:** Oval/round bruises on arms or chest (from shaking).
        *   **Implement marks:** Loops (wire/cord), linear (stick), buckle marks.
    *   **Note:** Bruises on soft areas (cheeks, buttocks, genitals) are suspicious; bruises on bony prominences (knees, forehead) are often accidental in toddlers.

*   **Lacerations:**
    *   **Torn Frenulum:** Laceration of the mucosa of the upper lip or tear of the [[frenulum]] is a **characteristic lesion**. This results from a blow to the mouth or force feeding/silencing a crying child.
    *   **Traumatic Alopecia:** Bald patches due to pulling out hair.

*   **Burns:**
    *   **Cigarette Burns:** Circular, punched-out, pitted burns (often on palms or soles).
    *   **Scalds:** "Glove and stocking" distribution indicates forced immersion in hot water. Clearly defined margins suggest non-accidental immersion (accidental burns have splash marks).
    *   **Branding:** Burns in the shape of electric irons or heaters.

#### 2. Skeletal Injuries (Fractures)
Usually multiple and in various stages of healing.
*   **Metaphyseal Fractures:** Chipping of the edges of metaphysis due to twisting/pulling force. Also known as **Bucket-handle fractures** or **Corner fractures**. This is **pathognomonic** of child abuse.
*   **Rib Fractures:** Multiple fractures, often posterior (near the spine), caused by violent squeezing of the chest.
*   **Spiral Fractures:** Seen in long bones (humerus/femur) due to twisting force.
*   **Skull Fractures:** Multiple, depressed, or "egg-shell" fractures.
*   **Radiological Sign:** Sub-periosteal calcification/hemorrhage is a common finding on X-ray.

#### 3. Head and CNS Injuries
*   **Subdural Hematoma (SDH):** The most common fatal injury.
*   **Diffuse Axonal Injury:** Due to shaking.
*   **Ocular Injuries:** [[Retinal hemorrhages]], lens displacement, or subconjunctival hemorrhage.

#### 4. Visceral Injuries
*   Rupture of liver or spleen (due to punching or stomping).
*   Intestinal perforation (duodenum/jejunum transection against the spine).
*   Mesenteric tears.

### Shaken Baby Syndrome
A specific form of abuse involving violent shaking of the infant (usually < 1 year). The weak neck muscles and relatively large head cause the brain to rotate and strike the skull. Also known as **Infantile Whiplash Syndrome**.

**Classic Triad:**
1.  **[[Subdural Hematoma]]** (Due to tearing of bridging veins).
2.  **[[Retinal Hemorrhage]]**.
3.  **[[Encephalopathy]]** (Brain edema/Diffuse Axonal Injury).

> **Note:** There may be **no external signs of injury** in Shaken Baby Syndrome.

### Diagnosis
Diagnosis depends on the "Index of Suspicion" by the treating doctor.

**Diagnostic Criteria (Signs suggesting abuse):**
1.  **Discrepancy:** The history given by parents does not explain the severity or mechanism of injury (e.g., "He fell off the sofa" but has bilateral femur fractures).
2.  **Delay:** Significant delay between the time of injury and seeking medical help.
3.  **Changing Stories:** Parents give different versions of the event to different staff.
4.  **Reaction:** Parents may show lack of concern or excessive concern; the child may be withdrawn or terrified of the parents.
5.  **Recurrence:** History of repeated admissions to different hospitals ("Doctor Shopping").

**Mnemonic for Suspicion: CHILD**
*   **C** - Consistency (History vs Injury mismatch)
*   **H** - History (Changing stories, delay)
*   **I** - Interaction (Abnormal parent-child interaction)
*   **L** - Location (Injuries in protected areas like back, thighs, genitals)
*   **D** - Development (Injuries not compatible with developmental age, e.g., fractures in a non-walking baby)

---

### Differential Diagnosis
Conditions that mimic abuse must be ruled out:
*   **[[Osteogenesis Imperfecta]]**: Brittle bones, blue sclera.
*   **Scurvy**: Subperiosteal bleeding, gum bleeding.
*   **Congenital Syphilis**: Bone lesions.
*   **Bleeding Disorders**: Hemophilia, Leukemia, Thrombocytopenia.
*   **Mongolian Spots**: Blue-grey macular lesions on the lower back (congenital, not bruises).
*   **[[Sudden Infant Death Syndrome]] (SIDS)**: Must be differentiated from suffocation.

### Comparison: Accidental vs Non-Accidental Injury

| Feature | Accidental Injury | Non-Accidental Injury (Abuse) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **History** | Consistent, prompt | Inconsistent, delayed |
| **Bruises** | Bony prominences (knees, forehead) | Soft areas (cheeks, buttocks, back, ears) |
| **Fractures** | Clavicle, single long bone | Ribs (posterior), Metaphyseal, Skull |
| **Burns** | Splash marks, irregular | Sharp margins, cigarette burns, patterned |
| **Interaction** | Parents comforting | Parents defensive/aggressive or indifferent |

### Autopsy Findings
*   **Whole Body X-ray:** Mandatory to detect old fractures (callus formation) and metaphyseal fractures.
*   **External:** Document distribution of bruises, bite marks, burns. Shave scalp to look for bruises. Check oral cavity for frenulum tears.
*   **Internal:**
    *   **Skull:** Check for subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
    *   **Eyes:** Remove orbital roof to check for retinal hemorrhage.
    *   **Abdomen:** Check for liver/spleen rupture and intramural hematoma of the bowel.
    *   **Ribs:** Strip parietal pleura to check for posterior rib fractures.

### Medicolegal Aspects
1.  **Reporting:** In many jurisdictions, it is mandatory for a doctor to report suspected child abuse to the authorities (Police/Child Welfare).
2.  **Confidentiality:** Professional secrecy is **not** a defense. The safety of the child overrides the duty of confidentiality.
3.  **Hospitalization:** The child should be admitted to the hospital (place of safety) for investigation and protection, even if injuries don't strictly require admission.
4.  **Legal Charges (India):**
    *   **Sec 317 IPC:** Abandonment of a child < 12 years.
    *   **Sec 323/325 IPC:** Causing hurt/grievous hurt.
    *   **Sec 302/304 IPC:** If the child dies (Murder/Culpable Homicide).
    *   **POCSO Act:** If sexual abuse is involved.
