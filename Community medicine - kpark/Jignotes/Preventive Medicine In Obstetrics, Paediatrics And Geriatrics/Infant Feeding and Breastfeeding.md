# [[Preventive Medicine In Obstetrics, Paediatrics And Geriatrics]] > Infant Feeding and Breastfeeding

### **Introduction to Infant Feeding**

Nutrition in the first year of life is the single most important determinant of survival, growth, and development. The choice of feeding determines the nutritional status and the morbidity/mortality profile of the child.

### **1. Breastfeeding**

[[Breast milk]] is the ideal, safe, specific, and complete food for the newborn. It is a "living fluid" containing antibodies, enzymes, and white blood cells.

#### **Types of Breast Milk**
*   **[[Colostrum]]** (The "First Immunization"):
    *   Secreted during the first 1-3 days after birth.
    *   **Characteristics:** Thick, yellow, and small in quantity.
    *   **Composition:** Rich in proteins (antibodies like **IgA**), Vitamin A, and anti-infective factors. Lower in fat than mature milk.
    *   **Function:** Protects against neonatal infections (diarrhea, respiratory) and helps pass meconium.
*   **Transitional Milk:** Secreted from 3-4 days until 2 weeks.
*   **Mature Milk:** Secreted after 2 weeks.
    *   **[[Foremilk]]:** The milk at the beginning of the feed. Watery, rich in protein, sugar, vitamins, and minerals. **Quenches thirst**.
    *   **[[Hindmilk]]:** The milk at the end of the feed. Rich in fat. **Provides energy and satisfies hunger**.

#### **Guidelines for Initiation and Duration**
*   **Initiation:**
    *   **Normal Delivery:** As soon as possible, ideally within **1 hour**.
    *   **Caesarean Section:** Within **4 hours**.
*   **Duration:**
    *   **[[Exclusive Breastfeeding]]:** For the first **6 months**. No other food or fluid (not even water) except medicines/vitamins.
    *   **Continued Breastfeeding:** Up to **2 years** or beyond along with complementary feeding.

#### **Advantages of Breastfeeding**

| Beneficiary | Advantages |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Infant** | • **Nutrition:** Complete nutrition for first 6 months.<br>• **Immunity:** Protects against Diarrhea, Pneumonia, Necrotizing Enterocolitis.<br>• **Development:** Higher IQ (approx. 8 points higher), better visual acuity.<br>• **Long-term:** Reduces risk of obesity, diabetes, and coronary heart disease later in life. |
| **Mother** | • **Involutions:** Oxytocin release helps uterus contract, reducing [[Postpartum Hemorrhage]] (PPH).<br>• **Contraception:** Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM) delays ovulation.<br>• **Cancer Protection:** Lowers risk of Breast and Ovarian cancer. |
| **Family/Society** | • **Economical:** Saves cost of formula/medical bills.<br>• **Hygienic:** Safe, clean, and right temperature. |

### **2. Comparison: Human Milk vs. Cow's Milk**

Human milk is species-specific. Cow's milk is designed for the rapid muscular growth of a calf ("brawn"), while human milk is designed for brain development ("brain").

| Nutrient | Human Milk | Cow's Milk | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Protein** | 1.1 g/100ml | 3.2 g/100ml | Human milk has less protein, reducing **renal solute load**. High Whey:Casein ratio makes it digestible. |
| **Carbohydrate** | 7.4 g/100ml | 4.4 g/100ml | Higher **Lactose** in human milk aids brain growth and calcium absorption. |
| **Fat** | 3.4 g/100ml | 4.1 g/100ml | Human milk rich in **PUFA** (Linoleic acid) and DHA for myelination. |
| **Minerals** | Low (0.2%) | High (0.8%) | High minerals in cow's milk burden the infant kidney. |
| **Iron** | Low quantity but **High Bioavailability** (70% absorbed) | Low quantity, Poor Bioavailability (30% absorbed) | Breastfed babies don't need iron supplements for 6 months. |
| **Energy** | 65 kcal/100ml | 67 kcal/100ml | Roughly similar caloric density. |

> **Clinical Relevance:** Cow's milk protein is tougher (casein dominant) and may cause micro-hemorrhages in the intestine leading to anemia. It should be avoided or diluted in early infancy if absolutely necessary.

### **3. Artificial Feeding**

Used only when breastfeeding is failed or contraindicated.
*   **Indications:** Maternal death, severe prolonged illness, or failure of breast milk.
*   **Hazards:** High risk of **Gastroenteritis**, malnutrition (due to over-dilution), and obesity (over-concentration).
*   **Principle:** If cow's milk is used in the first few months, it must be diluted to reduce the solute load on kidneys.

---

### **4. Complementary Feeding (Weaning)**

*   **Definition:** The process of introducing solid/semi-solid foods along with breast milk.
*   **Timing:** Start after **6 months** of age.
*   **Reason:** Breast milk alone is insufficient to meet energy/protein needs (especially iron and zinc) after 6 months.
*   **Principles:**
    1.  **Timely:** Started at 6 months.
    2.  **Adequate:** Sufficient energy, protein, and micronutrients.
    3.  **Safe:** Hygienically prepared and stored.
    4.  **Appropriate:** Soft consistency (mashed banana, dal, khichdi), easy to digest.
*   **Dietary Goals:**
    *   Consistency: From semi-solid to solid (family pot).
    *   Frequency: Increase from 2-3 times/day (6-8 months) to 3-4 times/day (9-24 months).

### **5. Assessment of Breastfeeding**

To ensure the baby is getting enough milk, check for **Positioning** and **Attachment**.

**Signs of Good Attachment:**
1.  Chin touching the breast.
2.  Mouth wide open.
3.  Lower lip turned outwards.
4.  More areola visible above the mouth than below.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a diagram showing the infant's mouth covering the areola with the lower lip everted and chin pressing the breast.

### **6. National Programmes & Legal Aspects**

1.  **[[Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative]] (BFHI):**
    *   Launched by WHO/UNICEF (1991).
    *   **Goal:** Protect, promote, and support breastfeeding.
    *   **Ten Steps:** Includes having a written policy, training staff, initiating breastfeeding within half an hour, practicing **Rooming-in**, giving no artificial teats/pacifiers, and encouraging on-demand feeding.

2.  **[[IMS Act]] (Infant Milk Substitutes Act, 1992/2003):**
    *   Bans advertisement and promotion of infant milk substitutes, feeding bottles, and infant foods.
    *   Prohibits pictures of mothers/babies on labels.

3.  **[[Mother's Absolute Affection]] (MAA):**
    *   Nationwide programme by MoHFW to promote breastfeeding.
    *   Focuses on counselling and support by health workers.

4.  **[[Lactation Management Centres]] (LMC):**
    *   Establishment of milk banks (Comprehensive LMC) in district hospitals for donation and storage of breast milk.

### **7. Contraindications to Breastfeeding**

*   **Absolute:**
    *   Infant: **Galactosemia**, Phenylketonuria (partial restriction).
    *   Mother: Taking cytotoxic drugs, radioactive isotopes.
*   **Relative/Condition Specific:**
    *   **HIV:** In India, infected mothers are advised to continue **Exclusive Breastfeeding** for 6 months along with Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) for mother and prophylaxis for the baby, to prevent malnutrition deaths. Mixed feeding is strictly avoided.
    *   **Active TB:** Mother can feed but should use a mask; if contagious, express milk and feed.
    *   **Hepatitis B:** Can breastfeed; infant should receive HBIG and Vaccine.
