# Meniscal Injuries of the Knee

### Relevant Anatomy
The [[menisci]] are crescent-shaped fibrocartilaginous structures placed on the condylar surface of the tibia. They deepen the articular surfaces of the tibial plateau to accommodate the femoral condyles.

*   **Medial Meniscus (MM):** Semicircular (C-shaped), larger radius, less mobile. Attached to the deep fibres of the [[medial collateral ligament]] (MCL). Consequently, it is **more commonly injured** (less mobile to escape crushing stress).
*   **Lateral Meniscus (LM):** Circular (O-shaped), smaller radius, more mobile. Separated from the [[lateral collateral ligament]] (LCL) by the [[popliteus tendon]].
*   **Blood Supply:**
    *   **Peripheral 10–30% (Red Zone):** Vascular, supplied by genicular arteries. Capable of healing.
    *   **Central Part (White Zone):** Avascular, receives nutrition via diffusion from [[synovial fluid]]. **Does not heal** spontaneously.
    *   **Intermediate (Red-White Zone):** Transition zone.

**Functions:**
1.  **Shock Absorption** (primary function).
2.  Load transmission and weight distribution.
3.  Joint lubrication.
4.  Joint stability (secondary stabilizer).

### Etiopathogenesis and Mechanism of Injury
Meniscal tears typically occur due to significant compression and rotational forces acting on the knee.

1.  **Traumatic Tears (Young Adults/Athletes):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Twisting force (torsion) applied to a **flexed**, **weight-bearing** knee.
    *   **Medial Meniscus:** Torn by **internal rotation** of the femur on a fixed tibia during flexion to extension.
    *   **Lateral Meniscus:** Torn by **external rotation** of the femur on a fixed tibia.
    *   Often associated with [[Anterior Cruciate Ligament]] (ACL) injuries ([[O'Donoghue's triad]]: ACL + MCL + Medial Meniscus).

2.  **Degenerative Tears (Elderly):**
    *   Occur with minimal trauma (e.g., rising from a chair) in fibrosed, stiff menisci associated with [[osteoarthritis]].

**Pathology of Tears:**
The meniscus typically tears longitudinally.
*   **Bucket-Handle Tear:** A longitudinal tear where the inner fragment displaces centrally, potentially blocking extension (**Locking**).
*   **Posterior Horn Tear:** Most common site of injury.
*   **Radial/Parrot Beak Tear.**
*   **Horizontal/Cleavage Tear.**

### Clinical Features
**Symptoms:**
*   **History:** Significant twisting injury during sports (football, cricket).
*   **Pain:** Localized to the joint line (medial or lateral).
*   **Swelling:** Delayed swelling (appearing after 6–24 hours) due to traumatic [[synovitis]]/effusion. *Note: Immediate swelling suggests [[haemarthrosis]] (ACL tear).*
*   **Locking:** True locking occurs in **bucket-handle tears**. The patient cannot fully extend the knee (a mechanical block) but flexion is usually possible.
*   **Clicking:** Sensation of a "click" or something moving inside the joint.
*   **Instability:** A feeling of "giving way" (though less common than in ligament injuries).

**Signs:**
*   **Tenderness:** **Joint line tenderness** is the most sensitive clinical sign.
*   **Quadriceps Wasting:** Seen in chronic cases (specifically vastus medialis).
*   **Effusion:** Moderate fluid accumulation.

### Clinical Tests for Meniscal Injury

| Test | Procedure | Positive Sign | Clinical Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[McMurray's Test]]** | Patient supine, knee flexed. Examiner holds foot and palpates joint line. <br>1. **Medial:** Ext. rotate foot + Valgus stress + Extend knee.<br>2. **Lateral:** Int. rotate foot + Varus stress + Extend knee. | Palpable/audible **click** accompanied by **pain** at the joint line. | Specific for posterior horn tears. |
| **[[Apley's Grinding Test]]** | Patient prone, knee flexed to 90°. Examiner anchors patient's thigh, presses foot down (**compression**) and rotates leg. | Pain on rotation with compression. | Distinguishes meniscal (pain on compression) from ligamentous injury (pain on distraction). |
| **[[Thessaly Test]]** | Patient stands on affected leg (flexed 20°). Examiner holds hands for balance. Patient twists body left and right. | Joint line pain or sensation of locking/catching. | High sensitivity and specificity for meniscal tears. |
| **Steinmann's Sign** | Knee flexed and rotated to elicit pain. The knee is then extended while maintaining rotation. | Tenderness moves **anteriorly** on extension and **posteriorly** on flexion. | Confirms meniscal pathology (pain migration). |
| **Childress Test (Duck Waddle)** | Patient squats and walks like a duck. | Pain or inability to fully squat. | Indicates posterior horn tear. |
| **Ege's Test** | Squatting with feet ext. rotated (Medial meniscus) or int. rotated (Lateral meniscus). | Pain/click. | Functional weight-bearing test. |

**Mnemonic for McMurray's Test:**
*   **M-E-M:** **M**cMurray **E**xternal rotation tests **M**edial Meniscus.
*   **L-I-L:** **L**ateral Meniscus tested with **I**nternal rotation (and **L**ateral/Varus stress).

### Investigations

1.  **X-Ray (Radiographs):**
    *   Usually normal.
    *   Done to rule out loose bodies, fractures, or osteoarthritis.
    *   *Calcification* of meniscus may be seen (Chondrocalcinosis).

2.  **[[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI):**
    *   **Investigation of Choice (IOC).**
    *   High sensitivity (>90%) and specificity.
    *   **Appearance:** Linear high signal intensity extending to the articular surface.
    *   **Double PCL Sign:** Indicates a displaced bucket-handle tear (fragment lies anterior to PCL).

3.  **[[Arthroscopy]] (Diagnostic):**
    *   **Gold Standard.** Allows direct visualization and simultaneous treatment.

### Management

The mantra for meniscal treatment is **"Save the Meniscus"** to prevent future osteoarthritis.

#### 1. Conservative Management
*   **Indications:**
    *   Small, stable tears (<10mm).
    *   Peripheral tears (Red zone) with good healing potential.
    *   Asymptomatic tears.
    *   Degenerative tears in elderly.
*   **Protocol:**
    *   **R.I.C.E.** (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation).
    *   NSAIDs for pain.
    *   Physiotherapy: [[Quadriceps]] strengthening exercises.
    *   Cylindrical cast for 3-4 weeks (if painful/locked).

#### 2. Surgical Management
Performed via **Arthroscopy**. Open surgery is largely obsolete.

*   **[[Partial Meniscectomy]]:**
    *   **Indication:** Tears in the avascular **White Zone** (cannot heal) or complex/degenerative tears.
    *   **Procedure:** Removal of only the torn/mobile fragment, balancing the rim to a stable edge. Total meniscectomy is avoided due to high risk of secondary OA (increases contact stress by >200%).

*   **[[Meniscal Repair]] (Meniscorrhaphy):**
    *   **Indication:** Tears in the vascular **Red Zone** or Red-White zone, especially in young active patients.
    *   **Techniques:** Inside-out, Outside-in, or All-inside sutures/darts.
    *   **Rehabilitation:** Non-weight bearing/protected weight bearing for 4-6 weeks to allow healing.

*   **[[Meniscal Transplantation]]:**
    *   **Indication:** Young patients with near-total meniscectomy and ensuing pain/early OA.
    *   **Source:** Allograft (cadaveric) or synthetic scaffolds (Collagen meniscus implants).

### Complications
1.  **[[Osteoarthritis]] (OA):** Most common long-term complication, especially after total or sub-total meniscectomy.
2.  **Recurrent Tears.**
3.  **Quadriceps atrophy.**
