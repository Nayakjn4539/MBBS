# [[Sports Injuries]] > De Quervain's Tenosynovitis (Finkelstein Test)

### De Quervain's Tenosynovitis

**Definition**
[[De Quervain's Tenosynovitis]] (also known as *De Quervain's Disease* or *Stenosing Tenosynovitis*) is a painful condition affecting the tendons on the thumb side of the wrist. It involves the inflammation and thickening of the fibrous tendon sheath (tenovaginitis) in the **first dorsal compartment** of the wrist.

#### Anatomy and Pathophysiology
*   **Affected Structure:** The **First Dorsal Compartment** of the wrist.
*   **Tendons Involved:**
    1.  [[Abductor Pollicis Longus]] (APL)
    2.  [[Extensor Pollicis Brevis]] (EPB)
*   **Pathology:** The fibrous sheath covering these tendons at the [[radial styloid process]] becomes thickened and hard due to chronic inflammation or overuse. This constriction prevents the free gliding of the tendons, causing pain and entrapment. Unlike typical tenosynovitis, **crepitus** is often conspicuous by its absence.

#### Etiology and Epidemiology
*   **Mechanism:** Repetitive microtrauma or overuse of the wrist (e.g., repetitive gripping, wringing, or lifting).
*   **Common Demographics:**
    *   **Gender:** Significantly more common in women (Female:Male ratio approx. 10:1).
    *   **Age:** typically 30–50 years.
    *   **Sports/Occupation:** Common in racquet sports, golfers, and occupations involving repetitive manual labor (e.g., carpenters, washerwomen).
    *   **Pregnancy/Postpartum:** Common in new mothers due to hormonal fluid retention and lifting infants.

#### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Pain:** Localized to the **radial side** of the wrist and base of the thumb. Pain may radiate up the forearm.
    *   **Aggravation:** Worsened by thumb movement, gripping, or ulnar deviation of the wrist.
    *   **Swelling:** A visible, hard swelling may be present over the [[radial styloid]].
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Tenderness:** Acute point tenderness at the tip of the radial styloid process.
    *   **Thickening:** The tendon sheath feels thick and hard on palpation.

### Finkelstein's Test
This is the **pathognomonic sign** for diagnosing [[De Quervain's Tenosynovitis]].

**Procedure:**
1.  **Step 1:** The examiner asks the patient to tuck their thumb into the palm of their hand.
2.  **Step 2:** The patient then makes a fist, enclosing the thumb with the other fingers.
3.  **Step 3:** The examiner (or the patient actively) turns the wrist sharply towards the **ulnar side** (ulnar deviation).

**Interpretation:**
*   **Positive Test:** The maneuver stretches the inflamed tendons (APL and EPB) over the radial styloid. A sharp, excruciating stab of pain localized over the [[radial styloid process]] indicates a positive result.
*   **Comparison:** Repeating the movement with the thumb left free is relatively painless; this differentiation confirms the diagnosis.

**Clinical Implication:**
While highly sensitive, Finkelstein's test can produce false positives in patients with [[Osteoarthritis]] of the first carpometacarpal (CMC) joint or [[Wartenberg’s syndrome]] (radial sensory neuritis). Careful palpation helps distinguish these.

### Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Key Differentiating Features |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Intersection Syndrome** | Tenosynovitis of the **2nd dorsal compartment**. Pain and crepitus are located more proximally and dorsally on the forearm (about 4 cm proximal to the wrist joint). |
| **CMC Arthritis** | Arthritis of the first carpometacarpal joint. Positive **Grind test**. Pain is at the base of the thumb rather than the radial styloid. |
| **Wartenberg’s Syndrome** | Neuritis of the superficial radial nerve. Symptoms are primarily sensory (burning/tingling) rather than mechanical pain. Positive [[Tinel’s sign]] over the nerve. |
| **Fracture Scaphoid** | History of trauma (fall on outstretched hand). Tenderness in the **anatomical snuffbox**. |

### Management

**Conservative Treatment**
*   **Rest:** Avoidance of aggravating activities.
*   **Splinting:** Use of a **Thumb Spica Splint** which immobilizes the wrist and the thumb (metacarpophalangeal joint).
*   **Medication:** Oral [[NSAIDs]] (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) to reduce inflammation.
*   **Injection:** Local infiltration of [[hydrocortisone]] (corticosteroid) into the tendon sheath. This is often curative in early cases.

**Surgical Treatment**
*   **Indication:** Failure of conservative management or chronic recurrence.
*   **Procedure:** Surgical release (decompression) of the first dorsal compartment.
*   **Technique:** A small incision is made over the radial styloid (avoiding the sensory branch of the radial nerve). The thickened fibrous sheath is slit longitudinally to allow free tendon gliding.

*   **E**xtensor **P**ollicis **B**revis
