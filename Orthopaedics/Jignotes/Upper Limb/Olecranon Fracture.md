# [[Upper Limb]] > Olecranon Fracture

# Olecranon Fracture

[[Olecranon fracture]] is a common injury of the upper limb, involving the proximal aspect of the [[ulna]]. It is an intra-articular fracture that disrupts the extensor mechanism of the elbow.

### Surgical Anatomy
*   **Structure:** The [[olecranon process]] is the proximal end of the [[ulna]]. It articulates with the trochlea of the [[humerus]] to form the humero-ulnar joint (hinge joint).
*   **Muscle Attachment:** The [[triceps brachii]] tendon inserts into the posterior aspect of the olecranon.
*   **Function:** It prevents anterior dislocation of the ulna and acts as a lever arm for the extensor mechanism.
*   **Bony Landmarks:** The olecranon, medial epicondyle, and lateral epicondyle form a specific relationship:
    *   **In Extension:** They lie in a straight horizontal line.
    *   **In Flexion:** They form an isosceles triangle.
    *   *Note:* In olecranon fractures (and dislocations), this relationship is **disturbed**. In supracondylar fractures, it is **maintained**.

### Mechanism of Injury
Fractures can occur via two main mechanisms:
1.  **Direct Trauma:** A direct blow to the point of the elbow (e.g., falling directly onto the tip of the elbow). This often results in **comminuted fractures**.
2.  **Indirect Trauma:** A fall on an outstretched hand with the elbow partially flexed. The forceful contraction of the [[triceps]] muscle avulses the olecranon fragment. This typically results in a **transverse** or **oblique fracture**.

### Classification
Classification helps in determining the treatment plan.

#### 1. Morphological Classification
*   **Transverse fracture:** Usually stable if undisplaced; unstable if the extensor mechanism pulls the fragment proximally.
*   **Oblique fracture:** Fracture line runs diagonally.
*   **Comminuted fracture:** Multiple fragments; often due to high-energy direct trauma.
*   **Avulsion fracture:** Small tip of the olecranon pulled off by the triceps.
*   **Fracture-Dislocation:** Associated with dislocation of the elbow (e.g., [[Monteggia fracture-dislocation]]).

#### 2. Mayo Classification (Based on Stability and Displacement)
| Type | Description | Stability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type I** | Undisplaced fracture | Stable |
| **Type II** | Displaced, stable fracture (posterior cortex intact) | Stable joint |
| **Type III** | Displaced, unstable fracture (fracture-dislocation) | Unstable joint |

*   *Subtypes A (Non-comminuted) and B (Comminuted) exist for Type II and III.*

### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Pain at the tip of the elbow.
    *   Swelling and bruising (ecchymosis) over the posterior elbow.
    *   Inability to move the elbow.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Tenderness:** Localized over the olecranon.
    *   **Palpable Gap:** A gap may be felt between the fracture fragments due to the pull of the [[triceps]].
    *   **Loss of Extension:** The patient is unable to actively extend the elbow against gravity (loss of extensor mechanism integrity).
    *   **3-Point Relationship:** The triangular relationship between the olecranon and epicondyles is distorted.

### Diagnostic Imaging
*   **X-rays:**
    *   **Views:** Anteroposterior (AP) and **Lateral** views are mandatory.
    *   **Findings:** The lateral view clearly shows the fracture line, the degree of displacement, and the extent of comminution.
    *   **Check:** Look for associated injuries like [[radial head fracture]] or dislocation.

### Treatment
The goal is to restore the articular surface and the extensor mechanism.

#### 1. Conservative Management
*   **Indication:** Undisplaced fractures with an intact extensor mechanism (patient can actively extend elbow against gravity).
*   **Method:**
    *   Immobilization in an **Above Elbow Cast** or posterior slab.
    *   **Position:** Elbow in 45° to 90° flexion (avoiding full flexion to prevent distraction of fragments) for 3–4 weeks.
    *   **Rehabilitation:** Gentle active motion is started after 3 weeks to prevent stiffness.

#### 2. Operative Management
Surgery is indicated for displaced fractures (>2mm gap) and those with disruption of the extensor mechanism.

**A. Tension Band Wiring (TBW)**
*   **Indications:** Simple transverse or short oblique fractures (non-comminuted).
*   **Principle:** Converts the **distractive force** of the triceps muscle into a **compressive force** at the fracture site during elbow flexion.
*   **Technique:**
    1.  Two parallel [[Kirschner wires]] (K-wires) are passed vertically across the fracture site.
    2.  A stainless steel wire is passed through a drill hole in the distal ulna and looped around the K-wires proximally in a **Figure-of-8** configuration.
    3.  Tightening the wire compresses the fracture.

**B. Plate and Screw Fixation**
*   **Indications:** Comminuted fractures, fracture-dislocations (Monteggia), or fractures extending into the coronoid process.
*   **Implants:** Pre-contoured anatomical locking plates (Hook plates) are often used to bridge the comminution and resist deforming forces.

**C. Intramedullary Fixation**
*   **Indications:** Transverse fractures.
*   **Implants:** A long 6.5 mm cancellous screw or a specialized intramedullary nail is inserted from the tip of the olecranon down the medullary canal of the ulna.

**D. Excision Arthroplasty**
*   **Indications:** Severely comminuted fractures in elderly, low-demand patients (usually >50-60 years old) where reconstruction is difficult.
*   **Technique:**
    *   Excision of the proximal fragment (up to 50% of the joint surface can be removed without causing major instability).
    *   **Crucial Step:** The [[triceps tendon]] must be firmly reattached to the distal ulnar stump (Triceps advancement).

### Complications
1.  **Stiffness:** Loss of terminal extension (10-15°) is common but usually does not affect function significantly. Early mobilization is key.
2.  **Hardware Prominence:** The olecranon is subcutaneous. K-wires from TBW often back out or cause skin irritation/bursitis, necessitating removal after union.
3.  **Non-union:** Rare in olecranon fractures; more common if fixation is inadequate. Treated with rigid fixation and bone grafting.
4.  **Ulnar Nerve Symptoms:** Neurapraxia or irritation due to hardware or initial trauma.
5.  **Post-Traumatic Osteoarthritis:** Occurs if the articular step-off is not reduced anatomically.
6.  **Heterotopic Ossification:** Formation of bone in soft tissues, leading to stiffness.

**Clinical Implication:**
*   Always check the **ulnar nerve** status before and after surgery as it runs in the cubital tunnel just medial to the olecranon.
*   **Tension Band Wiring** is the most commonly asked surgical technique for transverse olecranon fractures in exams. Remember the principle: **Distraction to Compression**.
