# [[HEALTH PLANNING & MANAGEMENT]] > Immunisation dropouts and left outs are found to be quite high for consecutive years in a block. Mention the possible reasons and outline the measures that can be adopted by the health administrator to improve the situation.

### **Definitions**

Before addressing the causes and solutions, it is essential to distinguish between the two groups:
*   **Left-outs:** Children who have **never** received any vaccination. They are usually unreached populations due to geographical or social barriers.
*   **Drop-outs:** Children who started the immunization schedule but discontinued it before completion (e.g., took [[DPT]]-1 but missed DPT-3).

### **1. Possible Reasons for High Dropouts and Left-outs**

The reasons can be broadly categorized into supply-side (systemic) and demand-side (community) issues.

**Table: Barriers to Immunization Coverage**,

| Category | Specific Reasons |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Operational & Administrative** | • **Shortage of vaccines** or logistics (syringes/diluents) leading to cancelled sessions.<br>• **Cold Chain Failure:** Breakdowns in [[Ice Lined Refrigerator (ILR)]] or lack of power backup.<br>• **Staff Vacancies:** Lack of ANMs (Auxiliary Nurse Midwife) at [[Sub-centre]] level.<br>• **Poor Micro-planning:** Missing hamlets, slums, or brick kilns during area mapping. |
| **Community & Social** | • **Migration:** High mobility of population (e.g., construction workers, nomads) makes tracking difficult.<br>• **Lack of Awareness:** Parents do not know the schedule, place, or benefits of vaccines.<br>• **Loss of Wages:** Daily wage earners may prioritize work over bringing a child to the session. |
| **Medical & Psychological** | • **Fear of [[AEFI]] (Adverse Events Following Immunization):** Fever or pain after the first dose often discourages parents from returning,.<br>• **Myths:** False beliefs (e.g., vaccines cause infertility).<br>• **Child Illness:** Parents often postpone vaccination if the child has a minor illness (false contraindication). |

### **2. Management Measures for the Health Administrator (BMOH)**

As a Block Medical Officer of Health (BMOH), the following systematic approach should be adopted to improve coverage:

#### **A. Planning and Analysis**
1.  **Analyze Data:** Review the **Primary Health Centre (PHC)** and Sub-centre reports to identify specific villages or urban slums with high dropout rates. Calculate the **Dropout Rate** using the formula:
    *   *(DPT1 - DPT3) / DPT1 x 100*.
2.  **Revise Micro-plans:** Update the block micro-plan to include unserved and underserved areas like brick kilns, construction sites, and nomadic settlements.
3.  **Head Count Survey:** Conduct a house-to-house survey to generate an updated list of beneficiaries (Due List) rather than relying on old census data.

#### **B. Strengthening Service Delivery**
4.  **Tracking System:** Implement the **Name-Based Tracking System** (e.g., [[Mother and Child Tracking System]] or MCTS). Ensure the **Immunization Register** and [[counterfoils]] of the immunization cards are updated regularly to track defaulters,.
    *   *Usage of Tickler Box:* Ensure ANMs use the tracking bag/tickler box to identify who is due for the next dose.
5.  **Mission Indradhanush:** Launch focused "catch-up" campaigns similar to [[Mission Indradhanush]] to cover all left-out and drop-out children,.
6.  **Alternate Vaccine Delivery (AVD):** Ensure vaccines reach the session sites on time through a robust courier/AVD system to prevent session cancellations due to logistic delays.

#### **C. Community Mobilization & Manpower**
7.  **ASHA Involvement:** Utilize the [[Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA)]] to mobilize beneficiaries.
    *   She should update the list of eligible couples and children.
    *   Incentivize ASHAs for ensuring "Full Immunization" of a child.
8.  **Regular VHNDs:** Organize **Village Health and Nutrition Days ([[VHND]])** regularly at the Anganwadi centers to provide immunization along with antenatal care and nutrition, making it a "one-stop" service.

#### **D. Communication (IEC/BCC)**
9.  **Address Vaccine Hesitancy:** Conduct **Interpersonal Communication (IPC)** to dispel myths.
10. **AEFI Management:** Educate parents that mild fever is a normal reaction and provide Paracetamol. Effective management of [[AEFI]] builds community trust.

#### **E. Monitoring and Supervision**
11. **Supportive Supervision:** The Medical Officer must visit session sites to check **Cold Chain** status (using [[Vaccine Vial Monitor]]) and injection safety.
12. **Review Meetings:** Conduct monthly review meetings with ANMs and ASHAs to discuss the specific reasons for dropouts in their respective sub-centre areas.
