# Cardiovascular Diseases (Hypertension and IHD)

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) comprise a group of diseases of the heart and vascular system. They are the leading cause of death globally, representing a major public health challenge due to the **[[Epidemiological Transition]]** (shift from communicable to non-communicable diseases).

## 1. Hypertension (The Silent Killer)

### Definition and Criteria
Hypertension is a chronic condition characterized by persistently raised blood pressure. It is often asymptomatic until organ damage occurs ("Iceberg Disease").

**Classification of Blood Pressure (JNC 7 / WHO)**

| Classification | Systolic BP (mmHg) | Diastolic BP (mmHg) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Normal** | < 120 | < 80 |
| **Pre-hypertension** | 120 - 139 | 80 - 89 |
| **Stage I Hypertension** | 140 - 159 | 90 - 99 |
| **Stage II Hypertension** | $\ge$ 160 | $\ge$ 100 |

*Note: Isolated Systolic Hypertension is SBP $\ge$ 140 and DBP < 90.*

### Epidemiological Concepts

**A. Rule of Halves**
This concept highlights the gap in detection and control of hypertension in the community.
*   **1:** Only **half** of the people with high blood pressure are **aware** of their condition.
*   **2:** Only **half** of those aware are being **treated**.
*   **3:** Only **half** of those treated are **adequately controlled**.

**B. Tracking of Blood Pressure**
If BP is monitored from childhood into adulthood, individuals tend to stay in the same "track" or percentile.
*   Children with higher BP tend to become adults with higher BP.
*   **Clinical Relevance:** Identifying "at-risk" children early allows for primordial prevention.

### Risk Factors
The etiology is multifactorial (polygenic inheritance + environment).

**1. Non-Modifiable Risk Factors:**
*   **Age:** BP rises with age.
*   **Sex:** No major difference, though males often have higher levels earlier.
*   **Genetic Factors:** Family history is significant. Polygenic inheritance.
*   **Ethnicity:** Higher in Black communities.

**2. Modifiable Risk Factors:**
*   **Obesity:** Risk increases with BMI > 25 and high Waist-Hip Ratio (Central Obesity).
*   **Salt Intake:** High salt intake (**7-8g/day**) increases BP. WHO recommends **< 5g/day**.
*   **Saturated Fat:** Increases serum cholesterol and BP.
*   **Alcohol:** High intake raises systolic pressure.
*   **Physical Activity:** Sedentary lifestyle increases risk.
*   **Environmental Stress:** Sympathetic over-activity.

### Prevention and Control

*   **Population Strategy (Primary Prevention):** Aim is to shift the community distribution of BP towards lower levels ("biological normality").
    *   **[[DASH Diet]]** (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension): Rich in fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy.
    *   Reduce salt intake to < 5g/day.
    *   Weight reduction.
    *   Promotion of physical activity.
*   **High-Risk Strategy:** Targeted screening of families with history of HTN or obese individuals.
*   **Secondary Prevention:** Early case detection (Screening) and Treatment (Compliance is key).

## 2. Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) / Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)

### Definition
Impairment of heart function due to inadequate blood flow to the heart compared to its needs, caused by obstructive changes in coronary circulation.

### Clinical Manifestations
1.  Angina Pectoris
2.  Myocardial Infarction (MI)
3.  Irregularities of the heart (Arrhythmias)
4.  Cardiac Failure
5.  Sudden Death

### Risk Factors (The Web of Causation)

**Mnemonic: SAD HEART**
*   **S**moking (Synergistic with other factors; dose-dependent risk)
*   **A**ge (Risk increases with age)
*   **D**iabetes (Risk is 2-3x higher)
*   **H**ypertension (Accelerates atherosclerosis)
*   **E**levated Cholesterol (LDL is "Bad", HDL is "Protective")
*   **A**lcohol (>75g/day is risky) / **A**ctivity (Sedentary is bad)
*   **R**ace / **R**elatives (Family History)
*   **T**ype A Personality (Aggressive, impatient, competitive)

**Key Lipid Indicators:**
*   High Risk: Total Cholesterol > 200 mg/dl.
*   **[[Prudent Diet]] Goal:** Cholesterol / HDL ratio should be **< 3.5**.
*   Protective: HDL > 40 mg/dl.

### Prevention Strategies

**1. Primordial Prevention**
*   Preventing the emergence of risk factors in populations where they have not yet appeared.
*   Discouraging children from smoking and adopting sedentary lifestyles.

**2. Primary Prevention**
*   **Population Strategy:**
    *   **[[Prudent Diet]]:**
        *   Fat intake: 20-30% of total energy.
        *   Saturated fats: < 10% (some sources say <7%).
        *   Dietary cholesterol: < 100 mg/1000 kcal.
        *   Salt: < 5g daily.
        *   Increase complex carbohydrates.
    *   Smoke-free society.
    *   Blood pressure control.
    *   Physical activity promotion.
*   **High-Risk Strategy:** Identifying individuals with high serum cholesterol or BP and providing specific advice/treatment.

**3. Secondary Prevention**
*   Prevention of recurrence in patients who have already suffered an attack.
*   Cessation of smoking is the *single most effective* intervention after an MI.
*   Control of diabetes and hypertension.

### Surveillance
**[[WHO STEPS]] Approach:** A standardized method for collecting data on NCDs.
*   **Step 1:** Questionnaire (Behavioral risk factors).
*   **Step 2:** Physical Measurements (BP, Height, Weight).
*   **Step 3:** Biochemical Measurements (Blood glucose, Lipids).
