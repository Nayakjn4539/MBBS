# [[Upper Limb]] > Bennett's Fracture Dislocation

# Bennett's Fracture Dislocation

### Definition
**Bennett's fracture** is an oblique, unstable, **[[intra-articular fracture]]** of the base of the **[[first metacarpal]]** bone. It is technically a fracture-subluxation involving the **[[first carpometacarpal joint]]** (trapezio-metacarpal joint).

*   **Key Characteristic:** The fracture line separates the volar ulnar aspect of the metacarpal base from the remaining shaft.

### Mechanism of Injury
The injury is usually caused by an axial force applied to the thumb while it is in a position of flexion.
*   **Common Scenarios:**
    *   Punching a hard object (boxing).
    *   Fall on an outstretched hand with the thumb abducted.
    *   Motorcycle/bicycle accidents (handlebar injury).

### Pathomechanics (The "Deforming Forces")
Understanding the displacement is crucial for reduction and treatment. The fracture creates two fragments:

1.  **Small Volar Fragment (Anterior beak):** This fragment remains in its anatomical position (undisplaced). It is held firmly in place against the **[[trapezium]]** by the strong **[[volar oblique ligament]]** (anterior oblique ligament).
2.  **Large Distal Fragment (Metacarpal Shaft):** This fragment is displaced proximally, radially, and dorsally.
    *   **Cause of displacement:** The unopposed pull of the **[[abductor pollicis longus]]** (APL) tendon attached to the base of the metacarpal.

### Clinical Features
*   **Pain:** Localized at the base of the thumb.
*   **Swelling:** Rapid swelling around the CMC joint.
*   **Tenderness:** Point tenderness over the first carpometacarpal joint.
*   **Deformity:** Prominence at the base of the thumb due to dorsal subluxation of the metacarpal shaft.
*   **Functional Loss:** Inability to pinch or grip objects due to pain and instability.

### Diagnostic Imaging
*   **X-Ray Views:**
    *   **True Lateral View:** Essential to visualize the degree of subluxation.
    *   **AP View:** Shows the fracture line.
    *   **Oblique View:** Helps delineate the size of the fragment.
*   **Findings:** A triangular fracture fragment at the ulnar base of the first metacarpal. The metacarpal shaft is subluxated proximally and dorsally.

### Differential Diagnosis: Bennett's vs. Rolando's

| Feature | [[Bennett's Fracture]] | [[Rolando's Fracture]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type** | Intra-articular | Intra-articular |
| **Morphology** | Oblique fracture (Two-part) | Comminuted fracture (Three-part, T or Y shaped) |
| **Stability** | Unstable (due to APL pull) | Highly unstable |
| **Treatment** | Often percutaneous pinning | Often requires ORIF or External Fixation |

### Management
The goal is accurate restoration of the articular surface to prevent arthritis.

#### 1. Non-Operative Management
*   **Indication:** Rarely successful for maintaining reduction due to the deforming pull of the APL. Only indicated for undisplaced fractures (rare).
*   **Method:** Closed reduction and immobilization in a **[[thumb spica cast]]**.
*   **Reduction Maneuver:** Longitudinal traction + Abduction + Extension (Pronation) + Direct pressure on the metacarpal base.

#### 2. Operative Management (Preferred)
*   **Closed Reduction and Percutaneous Pinning (CRPP):**
    *   **Indication:** Most displaced Bennett's fractures.
    *   **Technique:** Under **[[C-arm]]** guidance, the fracture is reduced using the maneuver described above. **[[Kirschner wires]]** (K-wires) are passed percutaneously to pin the metacarpal shaft to the trapezium or the adjacent second metacarpal.
*   **Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF):**
    *   **Indication:** Failure to achieve closed reduction, large fracture fragments, or if articular step-off persists (> 2mm).
    *   **Implants:** **[[Herbert screws]]** (headless compression screws) or mini-plates.

### Complications
1.  **[[Secondary Osteoarthritis]]:** The most common long-term complication if the articular surface is not congruent. Leads to pain and stiffness at the CMC joint.
2.  **[[Malunion]]:** Healing in a displaced position leads to weakness of pinch grip.
3.  **Stiffness:** Prolonged immobilization can lead to stiffness of the thumb and wrist.
4.  **Recurrent Subluxation:** If fixation is inadequate.
5.  **Infection:** Pin tract infection in cases of percutaneous wiring.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Instability:** Bennett's fracture is inherently unstable. Even if reduced perfectly in a cast, the pull of the APL muscle will almost always cause the fracture to slip and displace. Therefore, internal fixation (usually K-wires) is almost always necessary ("Fracture of Necessity").
*   **Significance:** Because the thumb accounts for 40-50% of hand function, malunion here causes significant disability compared to other metacarpals.

### Mnemonic
To remember the deforming force:
**"APL pulls Away"** -> The **A**bductor **P**ollicis **L**ongus pulls the shaft **A**way (proximal and dorsal).
