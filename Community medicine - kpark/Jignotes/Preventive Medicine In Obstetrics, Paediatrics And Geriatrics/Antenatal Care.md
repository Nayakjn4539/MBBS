# [[Preventive Medicine In Obstetrics, Paediatrics And Geriatrics]] > Antenatal Care

# Antenatal Care (ANC)

[[Antenatal care]] refers to the care of the woman during pregnancy. The primary aim of ANC is to achieve a **healthy mother and a healthy baby** at the end of a pregnancy. Ideally, this care should begin soon after conception and continue throughout pregnancy.

### Objectives of Antenatal Care

The specific objectives of ANC are to ensure a normal pregnancy with delivery of a healthy baby from a healthy mother.

**Mnemonic: "PROMISE"**
*   **P** - **Promote**, protect, and maintain the health of the mother during pregnancy.
*   **R** - **Reduce** [[Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR)]] and [[Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)]].
*   **O** - **Observe** and detect **"High Risk"** cases and give them special attention.
*   **M** - **Manage** and foresee complications (e.g., Pre-eclampsia, Malpresentation) and prevent them.
*   **I** - **Instruct** (Teach) the mother elements of child care, nutrition, personal hygiene, and environmental sanitation.
*   **S** - **Sensitize** the mother to the need for [[Family Planning]].
*   **E** - **Eliminate** anxiety and dread associated with delivery.

> **Note:** An additional objective is to attend to the **under-fives** accompanying the mother during visits.

### Schedule of Antenatal Visits

While ideal visits are frequent, in developing countries like India, a minimum number of visits is mandated to ensure coverage for the maximum number of women.

#### 1. Ideal Visit Schedule
*   **First 7 months:** Once a month
*   **8th month:** Twice a month (Once a fortnight)
*   **9th month onwards:** Once a week (until delivery)
*(Total: 13-14 visits)*

#### 2. Minimum Suggested Schedule (Recommended by GOI/WHO)
To ensure effective maternal care, a minimum of **4 visits** are recommended:

| Visit Number | Period of Gestation | Key Activities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1st Visit** | Within **12 weeks** (Early Registration) | • Registration of pregnancy<br>• Screening for health status/risk factors<br>• Baselines (BP, Weight, Hb)<br>• **Folic Acid** supplementation |
| **2nd Visit** | Between **14 and 26 weeks** | • Monitoring fetal growth<br>• Tetanus Toxoid (TT/Td) immunization<br>• **Iron Folic Acid (IFA)** supplementation start |
| **3rd Visit** | Between **28 and 34 weeks** | • Screen for anemia, PIH, Gestational Diabetes<br>• Assessment of fetal growth |
| **4th Visit** | Between **36 weeks and Term** | • Identification of fetal lie/presentation<br>• Birth preparedness<br>• Identification of hospital for delivery |

### Components of Antenatal Check-up

The preventive services provided during ANC can be categorized into:

#### 1. History Taking and Registration
*   **Registration:** Use of **Mother and Child Protection Card (MCP Card)**.
*   **History:** Confirm pregnancy, record date of [[Last Menstrual Period (LMP)]] to calculate **Expected Date of Delivery (EDD)**.
*   **History of Illness:** Identify hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, tuberculosis, etc.
*   **Obstetric History:** Previous stillbirths, caesarean sections, or obstructed labor.

#### 2. Physical Examination
*   **Weight:**
    *   Average weight gain during pregnancy: **9 - 11 kg**.
    *   Weight gain of <2 kg/month affects fetal growth ([[Intrauterine Growth Retardation]]).
*   **Blood Pressure:**
    *   Essential to rule out [[Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy]].
    *   **Significance:** BP $\ge$ 140/90 mmHg requires immediate attention.
*   **Pallor:** To detect [[Anaemia]].
*   **Oedema:** Swelling of face/hands/abdominal wall suggests Pre-eclampsia.

#### 3. Abdominal Examination
*   Measurement of **Fundal Height** to monitor fetal growth.
*   Determination of fetal lie and presentation (especially in 3rd trimester).
*   Auscultation of Fetal Heart Sounds (FHS).

#### 4. Laboratory Investigations
| Investigation | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Hemoglobin (Hb)** | To detect Anaemia (<11 g/dl). |
| **Urine Test** | Albumin (Pre-eclampsia) and Sugar (Diabetes). |
| **Blood Grouping** | ABO and **Rh factor** (To prevent Rh Isoimmunization). |
| **VDRL/RPR** | Screening for [[Syphilis]]. |
| **HIV/HBsAg** | Screening for HIV and Hepatitis B. |
| **Blood Sugar** | Screening for [[Gestational Diabetes Mellitus]]. |

### Preventive Interventions

#### A. Iron and Folic Acid (IFA) Supplementation
*   **Goal:** Prevention of Nutritional Anemia.
*   **Dosage (Prophylaxis):** One tablet daily containing **100 mg Elemental Iron** and **500 mcg Folic Acid**.
*   **Duration:** For at least **100 days** (Newer guidelines suggest 180 days under Anemia Mukt Bharat).
*   **Therapeutic:** If anemic, dose is increased to 2 tablets daily.

#### B. Tetanus Immunization
*   **Primary:** 2 doses of **TT** or **Td** (Tetanus-diphtheria).
    *   **1st Dose:** At registration (16-20 weeks/early pregnancy).
    *   **2nd Dose:** 4 weeks after the first dose.
*   **Booster:** If the woman was immunized in the last 3 years, only **1 booster dose** is required.

### Risk Approach ("High Risk" Pregnancy)
The central purpose of ANC is to filter out "at-risk" mothers who need specialized care.

**Criteria for High Risk Cases:**
*   **Elderly Primi:** Age > 30 years.
*   **Short Stature:** Height < 140 cm.
*   **Malpresentation:** Breech, Transverse lie.
*   **Antepartum Hemorrhage (APH)**, Threatened abortion.
*   **Pre-eclampsia** and **Eclampsia**.
*   **Anaemia:** Hb < 11 g/dl (Severe < 7 g/dl).
*   **Bad Obstetric History:** Previous stillbirth, intrauterine death (IUD), manual removal of placenta.
*   **Elderly Grand Multipara:** > 5 previous births.
*   **Prolonged Pregnancy:** > 14 days after EDD.
*   **Concurrent Diseases:** Cardiovascular disease, Kidney disease, Diabetes, TB.

### Antenatal Advice
During visits, counsel the mother on:
1.  **Diet:** Increase calorie intake (**+350 kcal/day**) and protein. Eat fresh, locally available foods.
2.  **Hygiene:** Personal cleanliness, breast care, dental hygiene.
3.  **Rest:** 8 hours sleep at night + 2 hours rest during the day (preferably left lateral decubitus).
4.  **Warning Signs:** Report immediately if: Swelling of feet, fits, headache, blurring vision, bleeding per vagina.
5.  **Family Planning:** Motivation for puerperal sterilization (if 2+ children).
