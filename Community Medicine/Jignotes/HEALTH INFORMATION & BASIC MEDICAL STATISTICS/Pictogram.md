# [[HEALTH INFORMATION & BASIC MEDICAL STATISTICS]] > Pictogram

### Pictogram (Picture Diagram)

**Definition**
A pictogram is a popular method of presenting statistical data to the "man in the street" and to those who cannot understand orthodox charts or complex tables,. It utilizes small pictures or symbols to represent data.

**Key Characteristics**
*   **Symbolism:** It uses small pictures or symbols related to the subject matter to present the data (e.g., a picture of a doctor to represent health workforce),.
*   **Scaling:** Each symbol or picture represents a fixed number of items or units (e.g., 1 picture of a person = 1,000 people).
*   **Fractions:** Fractions of a picture are used to represent numbers that are smaller than the value of a whole symbol,.
*   **Nature:** In essence, pictograms are a form of [[bar chart]] where bars are replaced by strings of pictures.

**Uses and Applications**
*   **Mass Awareness:** It is the best type of diagram for creating mass awareness in the general population,.
*   **Low Literacy:** Ideally suited for audiences who are illiterate or have difficulty interpreting traditional graphs like line charts or histograms,.
*   **Impact:** It is used to impress the frequency of the occurrence of events to the common man,.

**Examples**
1.  **Population per Physician:** A symbol of a doctor is used to represent the number of people served by one doctor in different countries.
2.  **Disease Burden:** Showing the burden of [[HIV/AIDS]] or malaria in developing versus developed countries.

*   **I** - **I**mpress frequency of events.
*   **C** - **C**an't use for precise analysis (only for general trends).

**Clinical Relevance**
