# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > After attending school picnic, large number of students developed diarrhoea and vomiting within 12 hours. How will you investigate the problem?

### Investigation of Food Poisoning Outbreak

This scenario represents a **Common Source, Single Exposure Epidemic** (also known as a [[Point Source Epidemic]]), typically characteristic of **Food Poisoning**. Since the incubation period is short (within 12 hours), the likely agents are *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Bacillus cereus*, or *Clostridium perfringens*.

As a medical expert, I will investigate this outbreak using the standard 10 steps of epidemiological investigation, tailored to this specific event.

---

### **1. Verification of Diagnosis**
*   **Rapid Assessment:** Visit the site/hospital immediately. Do not wait for lab results to start the investigation.
*   **Clinical Examination:** Examine a sample of cases. The symptoms (vomiting and diarrhea within 12 hours) strongly suggest **Food Poisoning** rather than cholera (which presents with rice-watery stool and no nausea/retching).
*   **Lab Confirmation:** Collect samples immediately before antibiotic administration.
    *   **Stool & Vomit:** Send to the laboratory for culture to identify the causative organism.
    *   **Food Samples:** Secure remnants of food served at the picnic. Send them in an ice box for bacteriological and chemical examination.

### **2. Confirmation of the Existence of an Epidemic**
*   An [[epidemic]] is defined as the occurrence of cases clearly in excess of normal expectancy.
*   Since a "large number" of students are affected simultaneously after a common event (picnic) compared to the usual absence of such cases, the existence of an epidemic is **confirmed**.

### **3. Defining the Population at Risk**
*   **Map the Cohort:** The population at risk includes **all** students, teachers, and staff who attended the school picnic and consumed the food.
*   **Census:** Obtain a complete list of all attendees (eaters and non-eaters) to calculate the denominator for attack rates.

### **4. Rapid Search for All Cases**
*   **Case Definition:** Establish a criteria, e.g., *"Any student/staff who attended the picnic and developed vomiting or diarrhea within 24 hours."*
*   **Data Collection:** Administer a questionnaire (Epidemiological Case Sheet) to **everyone** (both ill and healthy) covering:
    *   **Personal Data:** Name, age, sex, class.
    *   **Clinical History:** Time of onset, specific symptoms (nausea, abdominal pain, fever).
    *   **Food History:** *Crucial Step.* A detailed list of **all** food items eaten (water, snacks, lunch, drinks).

### **5. Data Analysis**
Describe the epidemic in terms of **Time, Place, and Person**.

*   **Time (Epidemic Curve):**
    *   Construct an [[Epidemic Curve]].
    *   In this case, it will show a **sharp rise and sharp fall** within a narrow time interval, indicating a **Point Source Epidemic**.
    *   Determine the **Median Incubation Period** to narrow down the causative agent.

*   **Person (Attack Rates):**
    *   Calculate the **Food-Specific Attack Rate** for each item served. This is the most important step to identify the incriminating food.

| Food Item | **Ill** (Ate) | **Total** (Ate) | **Attack Rate** (%) | **Ill** (Did not Eat) | **Total** (Did not Eat) | **Attack Rate** (%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sandwich** | 50 | 60 | **83.3%** | 5 | 40 | **12.5%** |
| **Ice Cream** | 20 | 50 | 40% | 35 | 50 | 70% |

*In the table above (example), the sandwich has the highest difference in attack rates, making it the suspect vehicle.*

*   **Place:**
    *   Prepare a [[Spot Map]] showing the distribution of cases (e.g., did students from one specific bus or class get sick?).

### **6. Formulation of Hypothesis**
Based on the analysis, formulate a hypothesis regarding:
*   **Possible Source:** The specific food item (e.g., potato salad, cream cake).
*   **Causative Agent:** Likely *Staph. aureus* (due to short incubation <6 hrs) or *B. cereus*.
*   **Mode of Spread:** Ingestion of contaminated food (Common vehicle).

### **7. Testing the Hypothesis**
*   Compare the attack rates of those who ate the suspect food versus those who did not.
*   Calculate the **Relative Risk (RR)**. A high RR implicated the food item.

### **8. Evaluation of Ecological Factors**
Investigate the **environmental conditions** that allowed the outbreak:
*   **Kitchen Inspection:** Check the place where food was prepared.
*   **Food Handlers:** Check for skin infections (boils/cuts), nasal discharge, or history of recent illness in cooks (source of *Staphylococci*).
*   **Storage:** Was the food kept at room temperature for long periods (Temperature Abuse)? This allows bacterial proliferation and toxin production.

### **9. Further Investigation**
*   **Lab Results:** Confirm the hypothesis by isolating the *same* organism (same phage type) from the **patients' stool/vomit** and the **remnant food**.
*   **Carrier Detection:** Test food handlers for carrier state (nasal/rectal swabs).

### **10. Writing the Report**
Submit a comprehensive report to health authorities covering the background, methodology, analysis, identified cause, and control measures taken.

### **Clinical Relevance: Differential Diagnosis by Incubation Period**
The short incubation period (<12 hours) is the key clinical clue here.

| Causative Agent | Incubation Period | Mechanism | Characteristic Symptoms |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Staph. aureus** | **1 – 6 hours** | Preformed Toxin | Nausea, severe vomiting, no fever. |
| **Bacillus cereus** | **1 – 6 hours** | Emetic Toxin | Vomiting (associated with fried rice). |
| **Cl. perfringens** | **6 – 24 hours** | Toxin in vivo | Diarrhea, cramps, little vomiting. |
| **Salmonella** | **12 – 24 hours** | Infection | Fever, diarrhea, vomiting. |
