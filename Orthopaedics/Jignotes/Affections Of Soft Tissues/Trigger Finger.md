# Trigger Finger (Stenosing Tenosynovitis)

### **Definition and Overview**
**Trigger Finger**, technically known as **Stenosing Tenosynovitis** or **Stenosing Tenovaginitis**, is a common disorder of the hand characterized by the catching, snapping, or locking of a finger in a flexed position.
*   It involves the constriction of the **fibrous digital sheath**, preventing the free gliding of the contained [[flexor tendon]].
*   The condition is termed "trigger finger" because when the locked finger is straightened with effort, it opens with a sudden snap, resembling the release of a trigger on a pistol.

### **Etiology and Epidemiology**
While the exact cause is often idiopathic, several risk factors contribute to the development of the condition.

*   **Gender:** More common in **females** than males.
*   **Age:** Predominantly affects middle-aged adults (40–60 years).
*   **Occupational:** Associated with manual labor involving repetitive gripping of hard objects or excessive use of the hand.
*   **Associated Comorbidities:**
    *   [[Diabetes Mellitus]] (Very common association).
    *   [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]].
    *   [[Hypothyroidism]].
    *   [[Amyloidosis]].
    *   [[Gout]].

### **Pathophysiology**
The primary pathology lies at the entrance of the fibrous tendon sheath in the palm.

1.  **Constriction:** There is inflammation and thickening of the [[fibrous tendon sheath]], specifically at the level of the **[[A1 pulley]]** (annular pulley) over the [[metacarpophalangeal joint]] (MCP).
2.  **Nodule Formation:** Due to friction and constriction, the underlying [[flexor tendon]] (usually the [[flexor digitorum profundus]] or [[flexor pollicis longus]]) develops a bulbous swelling or nodule proximal to the stenosis.
3.  **Mechanical Block:**
    *   When the finger is flexed, the swollen segment of the tendon is pulled proximally out of the sheath.
    *   When an attempt is made to extend the finger, the swollen nodule cannot easily re-enter the narrowed sheath/pulley.
    *   This results in "locking." With increased force, the nodule passes the constriction with a palpable and audible *snap*.

### **Clinical Features**
The condition most commonly affects the **[[ring finger]]**, followed by the thumb (Trigger Thumb), middle, index, and little fingers.

#### **Symptoms**
*   **Pain:** Initially, pain is felt at the base of the affected finger (distal palm), exacerbated by movement.
*   **Snapping/Clicking:** The patient feels a click when extending the finger from a flexed position.
*   **Locking:** In later stages, the finger gets stuck in flexion. The patient may need to use their other hand to passively straighten the locked finger.
*   **Morning Stiffness:** Symptoms are often worse in the morning.

#### **Signs**
*   **Tenderness:** Localized tenderness over the **[[metacarpophalangeal joint]]** (MCP) of the involved digit.
*   **Palpable Nodule:** A tender nodule can often be felt at the distal palmar crease (level of the A1 pulley).
*   **Demonstrable Triggering:** The examiner can ask the patient to make a fist and then open the hand; the affected finger lags behind and then snaps into extension.

### **Differential Diagnosis**
*   **[[Dupuytren's Contracture]]:** Causes fixed flexion deformity but does not snap or click; affects the palmar fascia rather than the tendon sheath.
*   **Infection:** Deep space infections or suppurative tenosynovitis (usually present with acute severe pain, swelling, and fever).
*   **[[Ganglion Cyst]]:** Specifically a volar retinacular ganglion (tender lump, but distinct from tendon entrapment mechanisms).

### **Treatment Management**

The treatment approach is graded based on the severity and duration of symptoms.

| Modality | Description | Indications |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conservative** | • **Rest & NSAIDs:** To reduce inflammation.<br>• **Splinting:** Immobilization of the finger (especially at night) to prevent locking.<br>• **Ultrasound Therapy:** May provide relief in early stages. | Early stages; mild symptoms,. |
| **Injection** | • **Corticosteroid Injection:** Infiltration of [[hydrocortisone]] or [[methylprednisolone]] into the [[flexor tendon sheath]]. This reduces swelling of the tendon nodule and sheath. | Long-standing pain; failure of conservative measures,. |
| **Operative** | • **Surgical Release:** Division/slitting of the thickened fibrous sheath (specifically the **[[A1 pulley]]**) to allow free gliding of the tendon.<br>• **Percutaneous Release:** Utilizing a needle to release the pulley (minimally invasive). | Refractory cases; locked fingers unresponsive to injections; Diabetic patients (often resistant to conservative care),. |

#### **Clinical Implication: Surgical Caution**
*   **Digital Nerves:** During surgical release, care must be taken not to damage the **[[digital nerves]]** which run close to the tendon sheath.
*   **Thumb Surgery:** In trigger thumb release, the **[[radial digital nerve]]** is particularly at risk.

### **Summary Mnemonic: TRIGGER**
*   **T**enderness at the MCP joint (A1 pulley).
*   **R**ing finger is most commonly affected.
*   **I**njection (Steroids) is the first-line invasive treatment.
*   **G**liding of tendon is obstructed.
*   **G**irls (Females) are more affected than males.
*   **E**xtension causes a "snap".
*   **R**elease of A1 pulley is the surgical cure.
