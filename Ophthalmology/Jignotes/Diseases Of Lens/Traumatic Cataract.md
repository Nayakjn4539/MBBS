# [[Diseases Of Lens]] > Traumatic Cataract

# Traumatic Cataract

Traumatic cataract is the opacification of the [[crystalline lens]] caused by mechanical injury (blunt or penetrating) or non-mechanical injury (radiation, electric shock). It is a major cause of uniocular blindness, especially in young adults.

## Etiology and Mechanism

The pathogenesis depends on the mode of trauma:

1.  **Blunt Trauma (Concussion Injury):**
    *   **Direct Mechanical Effect:** Impact disrupts the arrangement of [[lens fibers]].
    *   **Imbibition of Aqueous:** Damage to the [[lens capsule]] semi-permeability allows aqueous humor to enter, causing hydration and opacification.
    *   **Pigment Deposition:** Forceful contact between the iris and lens deposits pigment on the anterior capsule ([[Vossius Ring]]).

2.  **Penetrating Injury:**
    *   Direct rupture of the [[lens capsule]] leads to rapid hydration of cortex.
    *   Lens fibers swell and become flocculent, often protruding into the [[anterior chamber]].

3.  **Physical/Radiational Energy:**
    *   **Infrared:** Causes true exfoliation of the anterior capsule ([[Glassblower's cataract]]).
    *   **Electric Shock:** Coagulation of lens proteins.

## Rosette Cataract (Concussion Cataract)

[[Rosette Cataract]] is the most typical morphological form of cataract seen following blunt trauma (contusion injury).

### Pathogenesis
*   It occurs due to the separation of [[lens fibers]] along the star-shaped suture lines.
*   It is primarily caused by the imbibition of [[aqueous humor]] and direct mechanical effects of the injury.

### Morphology and Location
*   **Appearance:** Feathery lines of opacities arranged like the petals of a flower or a star.
*   **Location:** Most commonly found in the **Posterior Cortex** or **Posterior Subcapsular** region. Rarely, it can be in the anterior cortex.

### Classification of Rosette Cataract

| Feature | Early Rosette Cataract | Late Rosette Cataract |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Onset** | Appears shortly after injury (weeks). | Develops 1–2 years after injury. |
| **Location** | Usually posterior cortex. | Posterior cortex (deep in the lens). |
| **Appearance** | Feathery lines of opacities along suture lines. | Sutural extensions are shorter and more compact. |
| **Progression** | May remain stationary or progress to total cataract. | Often stationary but can progress. |

### Clinical Implications
*   **Visual Acuity:** Depends on the density and location (central vs. peripheral) of the rosette.
*   **Stability:** Some rosette cataracts remain stationary and do not require surgery if they are off-axis.

## Other Signs of Traumatic Cataract

### 1. Vossius Ring
*   **Definition:** A circular ring of brown pigment found on the [[anterior lens capsule]].
*   **Mechanism:** Occurs due to the striking of the contracted pupillary margin of the [[iris]] against the crystalline lens during blunt trauma.
*   **Appearance:** Typically smaller than the dilated pupil size.
*   **Clinical Significance:** It is a tell-tale sign of previous blunt trauma.

### 2. Traumatic Zonular Cataract
*   Rare form where opacities follow a zonular pattern.

### 3. Diffuse (Total) Cataract
*   Can result from rapid progression of a concussion cataract or severe penetrating injury.
*   May lead to intumescence (swollen lens) and secondary glaucoma.

### 4. Siderosis Bulbi (in penetrating trauma)
*   If an iron foreign body is retained.
*   **Lens Finding:** Rusty/orange deposits arranged radially in the anterior epithelium/capsule.

### 5. Chalcosis (Copper foreign body)
*   **Lens Finding:** [[Sunflower cataract]] (Greenish-brown deposit).

## Comparison of Specific Traumatic Cataract Types

| Type of Injury | Characteristic Cataract Morphology | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Blunt Trauma** | [[Rosette cataract]] (Posterior cortex)<br>[[Vossius ring]] (Anterior capsule) | Concussion/Shockwaves |
| **Penetrating Injury** | Cortical cataract (Flocculent/Swollen)<br>Total cataract | Capsular rupture & hydration |
| **Infrared Rays** | [[Glassblower's cataract]]<br>Posterior polar opacity + True exfoliation | Thermal effect on lens fibers |
| **Electric Shock** | Punctate subcapsular opacities (Anterior/Posterior) | Protein coagulation |
| **Ionizing Radiation** | Posterior subcapsular cataract | Damage to germinal epithelium |

## Complications of Traumatic Cataract

If untreated or severe, traumatic cataract can lead to:
1.  **Phacolytic Glaucoma:** Leakage of lens proteins from a hypermature cataract clogs the [[trabecular meshwork]].
2.  **Phacomorphic Glaucoma:** Swollen (intumescent) lens causes pupillary block and angle closure.
3.  **Lens Dislocation/Subluxation:** Due to zonular dialysis (associated [[Ectopia Lentis]]).
4.  **Phacoanaphylactic Uveitis:** Granulomatous inflammation due to sensitization to lens proteins.

## Management

### 1. Evaluation
*   **History:** Nature of trauma (blunt vs. penetrating, chemical, electric).
*   **Slit Lamp Examination:** To assess morphology (Rosette, Vossius ring), capsule integrity, and zonular status ([[Phacodonesis]]).
*   **B-Scan USG:** Crucial in opaque media to rule out [[Retinal Detachment]] or [[Intraocular Foreign Body]].

### 2. Medical Management
*   **Observation:** For small, stationary rosette cataracts or Vossius rings that do not obscure the visual axis.
*   **Mydriatics:** May improve vision if the opacity is central.

### 3. Surgical Management
*   **Indications:**
    *   Visual acuity significantly impaired.
    *   Lens-induced glaucoma or uveitis.
    *   Obscuration of fundus view hindering treatment of retinal pathology.
    *   Ruptured capsule with cortical matter in [[anterior chamber]].
*   **Procedure:**
    *   **Phacoemulsification** or **ECCE** with **PCIOL** (Posterior Chamber Intraocular Lens).
    *   If zonular support is inadequate: [[Capsular Tension Ring]] (CTR), Scleral Fixated IOL (SFIOL), or Anterior Chamber IOL (ACIOL) may be required.

**Mnemonic for Causes of Cataract Types:**
*   **"Rosy likes Blunt things"**: [[Rosette cataract]] is caused by Blunt trauma.
*   **"Glass Blowers peel the skin"**: [[Glassblower's cataract]] causes True Exfoliation.
