# [[General Toxicology]] > Antidotes

### Definition
**[[Antidote]]** is a substance which counteracts or neutralizes the effects of a poison.

### Classification of Antidotes
Antidotes are broadly classified based on their **mechanism of action**:

#### 1. Mechanical or Physical Antidotes
These agents impede the absorption of the poison by mechanical action (adsorption, coating, or dissolving).
*   **[[Activated Charcoal]]**: 
    *   **Mechanism:** Adsorbs the poison and retains it within its pores, preventing absorption from the stomach.
    *   **Dose:** 1 g/kg body weight (Adults: 50–100 g; Children: 15–30 g).
    *   **Method:** Mixed with water to form a slurry (soup-like consistency).
    *   **Effective for:** Alkaloids, Barbiturates, Salicylates, Strychnine, Phenothiazines.
    *   **Ineffective for:** Cyanide, Alcohol, Corrosives, Hydrocarbons, Iron.
*   **Demulcents**:
    *   **Mechanism:** Form a protective coating on the gastric mucous membrane to minimize damage.
    *   **Examples:** Milk, starch, egg-white, milk of magnesia.
    *   **Note:** Fats/oils should be **avoided** in fat-soluble poisons (e.g., Phosphorus, Organophosphates, Kerosene).
*   **Bulky Food**:
    *   **Use:** Ingested glass powder or sharp objects.
    *   **Mechanism:** Imprisons particles within meshes of food (e.g., bananas, boiled rice).

#### 2. Chemical Antidotes
These counteract the poison by forming harmless or insoluble compounds or by oxidizing the poison.
*   **[[Potassium Permanganate]] (KMnO₄)**:
    *   **Mechanism:** Oxidizing agent.
    *   **Use:** [[Gastric Lavage]] (1:5000 solution) for oxidizable poisons like Opium, Strychnine, Cyanide, Phosphorus.
    *   **Sign:** Solution turns from pink to colorless when reacting with poison.
*   **Chemical Neutralizers**:
    *   **Alkalis:** Weak acids (vinegar, lemon juice) used for alkali poisoning.
    *   **Acids:** Weak alkalis (magnesia) used for acid poisoning.
    *   *Caution:* Neutralization is generally **not recommended** now due to risk of exothermic reaction causing heat injury and gas production leading to perforation.
*   **Precipitants**:
    *   **Tannic Acid/Strong Tea:** Precipitates alkaloids (Strychnine, Nicotine, Cocaine) and metals (Lead, Silver).
    *   **Albumin (Egg white):** Precipitates Mercuric chloride.
*   **[[Chelating Agents]]**:
    *   Form stable, non-toxic, soluble complexes with heavy metals which are then excreted by kidneys.
    *   **BAL (Dimercaprol):** For [[Arsenic]], [[Mercury]], Copper, Lead (adjunct).
    *   **EDTA (Ca-Disodium Versenate):** For [[Lead]], Copper, Zinc.
    *   **D-Penicillamine:** For Copper (Wilson's disease), Mercury, Lead.
    *   **Desferrioxamine:** For [[Iron]].

#### 3. Physiological (Pharmacological) Antidotes
These act on body tissues/receptors to produce effects opposite to those caused by the poison (Antagonism).
*   **Atropine:** Blocks muscarinic effects of [[Organophosphates]].
*   **Naloxone:** Blocks opioid receptors in [[Morphine]]/Heroin overdose.
*   **Flumazenil:** Competitive antagonist for [[Benzodiazepines]].

#### 4. Metabolic Antidotes (Reduced Toxic Conversion)
These alter the metabolism of the toxin to prevent the formation of toxic metabolites.
*   **Ethanol / [[Fomepizole]]**: Compete with alcohol dehydrogenase to prevent conversion of [[Methanol]] to Formic acid and [[Ethylene Glycol]] to Oxalic acid.

### Universal Antidote (Obsolete)
Historically used when the nature of the poison was unknown. It is **no longer recommended** as it is less effective than activated charcoal alone.
*   **Composition:**
    1.  **Powdered Charcoal (2 parts):** Adsorbent.
    2.  **Magnesium Oxide (1 part):** Neutralizes acids.
    3.  **Tannic Acid / Strong Tea (1 part):** Precipitates alkaloids.
*   **Mnemonic:** **"Two Chats with One Magpie & One Tanner"** (2 Charcoal, 1 Mag Oxide, 1 Tannic acid).

### "Coma Cocktail"

*   **Thiamine (B1):** For Wernicke’s encephalopathy (alcoholics).
*   **Naloxone:** For Opioid overdose.

### Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Duty to Treat:** The doctor has a legal and ethical duty to administer the specific antidote if available.
*   **Negligence:** Failure to give a known specific antidote, using an [[Obsolete Antidote]] (like universal antidote), or giving the wrong dose causing harm amounts to **[[Medical Negligence]]** (Malpraxis).
*   **Therapeutic Misadventure:** Excessive dose of an antidote causing death (e.g., Atropine toxicity during OPC treatment) may be labelled as therapeutic misadventure.
*   **Preservation:** In fatal cases, if the patient was treated, the chemical analysis of viscera might reveal the antidote or its metabolites, confirming that treatment was attempted.
