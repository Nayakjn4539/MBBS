# [[Nutrition And Health]] > Nutritional Anaemia

# Nutritional Anaemia (Iron and Folic Acid)

### **Definition**
[[Nutritional Anaemia]] is a condition in which the hemoglobin content of the blood is lower than normal as a result of a deficiency of one or more essential nutrients, regardless of the cause of such deficiency.
*   It is a syndrome caused by malnutrition in its widest sense.
*   **Most common cause:** [[Iron Deficiency]] (microcytic hypochromic).
*   **Second most common:** [[Folate Deficiency]] (megaloblastic) or Vitamin B12 deficiency.

### **WHO Criteria for Diagnosis of Anaemia**
Cut-off points for Hemoglobin (Hb) concentration at sea level:

| Group | Hemoglobin (g/dl) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Children (6 months - 59 months)** | < 11.0 |
| **Children (5 - 11 years)** | < 11.5 |
| **Children (12 - 14 years)** | < 12.0 |
| **Adult Women (Non-pregnant)** | < 12.0 |
| **Adult Women (Pregnant)** | < 11.0 |
| **Adult Men** | < 13.0 |

> **Clinical Relevance:** Anaemia is a late manifestation of iron deficiency. Symptoms and adverse physiological alterations may occur before Hb drops significantly.

### **Epidemiological Determinants**

#### **1. Agent Factors (Nutrients)**
*   **Iron:** Essential for Hb formation.
    *   **Haem Iron:** Animal sources (liver, meat, fish). Better absorption (20-30%).
    *   **Non-Haem Iron:** Plant sources (green leafy vegetables, cereals, jaggery). Poor absorption (3-5%) due to inhibitors.
*   **Folic Acid:** Essential for DNA synthesis and RBC maturation.
    *   Deficiency leads to **Megaloblastic Anaemia** and **Neural Tube Defects** in fetus.
*   **Protein:** Essential for globin synthesis.

#### **2. Host Factors**
*   **Increased Demand:** Pregnancy (needs +1000mg iron), lactation, rapid growth in infancy and adolescence.
*   **Blood Loss:** Menstruation, hookworm infestation ([[Ancylostomiasis]]), malaria, bleeding piles.
*   **Absorption Defects:** Diarrhea, low gastric acid.

#### **3. Environmental Factors**
*   **Dietary Habits:** Predominantly cereal-based diet rich in **Phytates** and **Tannins** (inhibitors of iron absorption).
*   **Poor Sanitation:** Leads to hookworm infection (soil-transmitted helminths).
*   **Cooking Practices:** Overcooking destroys Folic Acid.

### **Clinical Features**
*   **General:** Fatigue, lassitude, breathlessness on exertion, palpitations, anorexia.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Pallor:** Palpebral conjunctiva, tongue, nail beds, palms.
    *   **Oral:** [[Glossitis]], angular stomatitis (common in B-vitamin deficiency).
    *   **Nails:** [[Koilonychia]] (spoon-shaped nails) - specific to Iron deficiency.
    *   **Pica:** History of eating mud/clay/ice (geophagia).

### **Laboratory Diagnosis**
1.  **Hemoglobin Estimation:** Cyanmethemoglobin method is the gold standard.
2.  **Peripheral Smear:**
    *   *Iron Deficiency:* Microcytic, hypochromic.
    *   *Folic Acid/B12 Deficiency:* Macrocytic (Megaloblastic).
3.  **Serum Ferritin:** The **single most sensitive tool** for evaluating iron status. Reflects body iron stores (<12 mcg/L indicates depletion).
4.  **Serum Iron & Transferrin Saturation:** Low serum iron, Low saturation (<16%).

### **Consequences of Nutritional Anaemia**
*   **Pregnancy:** Increased risk of [[Maternal Mortality]] (20-40% of maternal deaths in India), Low Birth Weight (LBW), preterm delivery.
*   **Work Capacity:** Significant impairment of physical work performance and productivity.
*   **Infection:** Impaired cell-mediated immunity; increased susceptibility to infections.
*   **Cognitive:** Reduced attention span and learning ability in children.

### **Prevention and Control Strategies**

#### **1. Dietary Modification**
*   **Increase Intake:** Green leafy vegetables (spinach, amaranth), pulses, jaggery, liver, meat.
*   **Enhance Absorption:** Consume **Vitamin C** (Amla, Guava, Citrus fruits) with meals. It promotes iron absorption.
*   **Avoid Inhibitors:** Do not consume tea/coffee immediately after meals (tannins block absorption).

#### **2. Control of Parasitic Infections**
*   **Deworming:** Periodic administration of [[Albendazole]] (400 mg) to control hookworms.
*   Treatment of Malaria in endemic areas.

#### **3. Food Fortification**
*   **Double Fortified Salt (DFS):** Salt fortified with both **Iron and Iodine**.
*   **Composition:** 1 gm of DFS provides **1 mg Iron** and **40 mcg Iodine**.

#### **4. Supplementation: [[Anemia Mukt Bharat]] (AMB) Strategy**
*This is the current National Iron+ Initiative strategy employing the **6x6x6** approach.*

**Prophylactic Iron and Folic Acid (IFA) Doses:**

| Target Group | Dose/Regimen | Color Code |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Children (6-59 months)** | **20 mg** elemental Iron + **100 mcg** Folic Acid<br>(Bi-weekly, 1 ml syrup) | **Bi-weekly** (Bottle) |
| **Children (5-9 years)** | **45 mg** elemental Iron + **400 mcg** Folic Acid<br>(Weekly) | **Pink** Tablet |
| **Adolescents (10-19 years)** | **60 mg** elemental Iron + **500 mcg** Folic Acid<br>(Weekly) | **Blue** Tablet |
| **Women of Reproductive Age** (Non-pregnant/Non-lactating) | **60 mg** elemental Iron + **500 mcg** Folic Acid<br>(Weekly) | **Red** Tablet |
| **Pregnant & Lactating Mothers** | **60 mg** elemental Iron + **500 mcg** Folic Acid<br>(Daily for 180 days starting from 4th month) | **Red** Tablet |

> **Note on Pregnancy Treatment:** If a pregnant woman is anemic, the therapeutic dose is **Two Red Tablets daily** (120mg Iron + 1mg Folic Acid) until Hb normalizes, followed by the prophylactic dose for remaining duration.

### **Mnemonics**

**Symptoms of Severe Anaemia (P-A-L-E)**
*   **P** - Palpitations/Pulse rate increased
*   **A** - Angina/Ankle edema
*   **L** - Lethargy/Lassitude
*   **E** - Exertional Dyspnea

**AMB Tablet Colors (Young to Old -> Light to Dark)**
*   **Pink** (Kids 5-9) -> *Think "Pink Cheeks of School kids"*
*   **Blue** (Teens 10-19) -> *Think "High School Blues"*
*   **Red** (Adults/Pregnant) -> *Think "Blood/Danger"*
