# Assessment of Color Vision

## Physiological Basis of Color Vision
Color vision is a function of the [[cones]] found in the retina, primarily concentrated at the [[fovea centralis]]. It is better appreciated in photopic vision (bright light).

### Theories of Color Vision
1.  **Trichromatic Theory (Young-Helmholtz):** Postulates the existence of three types of photosensitive pigments in the cones,.
    *   **Erythrolabe:** Red sensitive (Long wavelength - 565 nm).
    *   **Chlorolabe:** Green sensitive (Medium wavelength - 535 nm).
    *   **Cyanolabe:** Blue sensitive (Short wavelength - 440 nm).
2.  **Opponent Process Theory (Hering):** Suggests that color perception is controlled by activity of two opponent systems: a blue-yellow mechanism and a red-green mechanism.

## Classification of Color Vision Defects
Defects are broadly classified into Congenital and Acquired.

### 1. Congenital Defects
*   **Inheritance:** Usually X-linked recessive (affects 3-8% of males, <0.4% of females). Females are carriers,.
*   **Characteristics:** Bilateral, symmetrical, non-progressive, and usually involve red-green confusion.
*   **Classification based on severity:**
    *   **Anomalous Trichromacy:** All 3 pigments present but one is defective/weak.
        *   **Protanomaly:** Red weakness.
        *   **Deuteranomaly:** Green weakness (Most common type).
        *   **Tritanomaly:** Blue weakness (Rare),.
    *   **Dichromacy:** Only 2 pigments present; one is completely absent.
        *   **Protanopia:** Red absent (Red-blind).
        *   **Deuteranopia:** Green absent (Green-blind).
        *   **Tritanopia:** Blue absent (Blue-blind),.
    *   **Monochromacy:** Total color blindness (Achromatopsia). Only rods present or only one cone type.

### 2. Acquired Defects
*   **Etiology:** Secondary to ocular or systemic pathology.
*   **Characteristics:** Unilateral or asymmetrical, progressive, associated with decreased visual acuity or visual field defects.
*   **Kollner’s Rule:**
    *   **Red-Green Defects:** Lesions of the [[Optic Nerve]] and visual pathway (e.g., [[Optic Neuritis]], Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy).
    *   **Blue-Yellow Defects:** Lesions of the Outer Retina/[[Macula]] (e.g., [[Central Serous Retinopathy]], ARMD),.
    *   *Exceptions:* [[Glaucoma]] and Autosomal Dominant Optic Atrophy cause Blue-Yellow defects despite being optic neuropathies.

### Comparison: Congenital vs. Acquired Color Defects

| Feature | Congenital | Acquired |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Laterality** | Bilateral & Symmetrical | Unilateral or Asymmetrical |
| **Progression** | Stationary | Progressive (can improve or worsen) |
| **Color Involved** | Red-Green (Common)<br>Blue-Yellow (Rare) | Blue-Yellow (Macular)<br>Red-Green (Optic Nerve) |
| **Visual Acuity** | Usually Normal | Usually Reduced |
| **Naming Colors** | Correct (by association) | Incorrect (recent error) |
| **Patient Awareness** | Unaware | Aware of change |

## Methods of Assessment
Tests are designed for screening, qualitative classification, or quantitative analysis.

### 1. Pseudoisochromatic Charts
These are the most commonly used tests for clinical screening. They utilize the principle of "confusion colors" where dots of primary colors are set against a background of confusion colors.

#### A. Ishihara Charts
*   **Usage:** Most common screening test for **Red-Green** defects,.
*   **Limitation:** **Cannot** detect Tritan (Blue-Yellow) defects.
*   **Configuration:** Plates containing numbers or winding paths (for illiterates/children) formed by colored dots.
*   **Lighting:** Must be performed in daylight or standard illuminant C.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   **Transforming plates:** Normals see one number; defectives see another.
    *   **Vanishing plates:** Normals see a number; defectives see nothing.
    *   **Hidden/Diagnostic plates:** Only defectives see the number.

#### B. Hardy-Rand-Rittler (HRR) Plates
*   **Advantage:** More sensitive than Ishihara.
*   **Capabilities:** Can detect **all three** congenital defects (Protan, Deutan, and Tritan),.
*   **Structure:** Uses geometric shapes (circles, triangles, crosses). Can also grade the severity of the defect.

### 2. Arrangement Tests (Hue Discrimination)
These tests require the patient to arrange colored caps in a specific spectral order (hue sequence). They are sensitive for quantitative assessment.

#### A. Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Test
*   **Components:** 85 colored caps (not 100) divided into 4 boxes,.
*   **Utility:** Most sensitive test.
*   **Function:**
    *   Differentiates congenital vs. acquired defects.
    *   Diagnoses the *type* (axis of confusion) and *severity* of the defect based on an error score.
*   **Clinical Use:** Monitoring toxicity (e.g., Ethambutol) and detailed vocational testing.

#### B. Farnsworth D-15 Test (Panel D-15)
*   **Components:** 15 colored caps + 1 reference cap.
*   **Utility:** Dichotomous test.
*   **Function:** Distinguishes between severe color deficiency and milder forms/normals. It is faster than the 100 Hue test but less sensitive.

### 3. Matching Tests (Anomaloscopes)
#### Nagel’s Anomaloscope
*   **Status:** **Gold Standard** for quantitative analysis.
*   **Principle:** Based on the **Rayleigh Equation** ($Red + Green = Yellow$).
*   **Procedure:**
    *   The patient views a split circular field.
    *   Lower half: Yellow (monochromatic sodium light).
    *   Upper half: Mixture of Red (Lithium) and Green (Thallium).
    *   The patient adjusts the ratio of Red/Green and the brightness of Yellow to match the two halves.
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   **Protanopes:** Match Yellow with pure Red or pure Green (brightness differs).
    *   **Deuteranopes:** Match Yellow with pure Red or pure Green (brightness same).
    *   **Anomalous Trichromats:** Use abnormal proportions of Red or Green to match Yellow.

### 4. Lantern Tests
Used primarily for vocational/occupational testing (e.g., railways, aviation, marine services) to test the ability to recognize signals.

#### Edridge-Green Lantern
*   **Procedure:** Patient names the colors of lights shown through varying aperture sizes (simulating distance) and through filters (simulating fog/rain),.
*   **Utility:** Judges if the candidate is "safe" or "unsafe" for the profession.

### 5. Other Tests
*   **City University Test:** Spectroscopic matching test. Central colored plate matched to surrounding dots.
*   **Holmgren’s Wools:** Patient matches skeins of colored wool. Old test, largely obsolete.

## Clinical Implications & Mnemonics

### Mnemonics for Color Vision
*   **Primary Colors:** **RGB** (Red, Green, Blue).
*   **Defect Names:**
    *   **Pro**to (1st) = **Red**
    *   **Deut**ro (2nd) = **Green**
    *   **Tri**ta (3rd) = **Blue**
*   **Kollner's Rule Exception:** **Glaucoma** is an Optic Nerve disease but causes **Blue-Yellow** defect (Think: "Blue" pressure).

### Clinical Pearls
*   **Optic Neuritis:** Red desaturation (red looks washed out/pink) is a very sensitive early sign, often present even when visual acuity is good.
*   **Drug Toxicity:**
    *   **Ethambutol:** Causes Optic Neuritis $\rightarrow$ Red-Green defect.
    *   **Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine:** Causes Maculopathy $\rightarrow$ Blue-Yellow defect (screening with Ishihara is useless here; use HRR or FM-100).
    *   **Digitalis:** Xanthopsia (Yellow vision).
    *   **Sildenafil:** Blue-tinged vision (Cyanopsia).
