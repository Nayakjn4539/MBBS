# [[HOSPITAL WASTE MANAGEMENT]] > There are 4 types of colour coding bags as per biomedical waste management rule 2016, amended in 2018.

# Biomedical Waste Management Color Coding

According to the **Biomedical Waste Management Rules 2016** (amended in 2018), segregation of waste at the point of generation is the most critical step. The rules prescribe **4 categories** of color-coded bags/containers to ensure safe disposal and prevent the spread of infection.

[[Biomedical Waste Management]] involves the segregation of waste into **Yellow**, **Red**, **White**, and **Blue** categories.

### 1. Yellow Category
This category is primarily for waste that requires **incineration** or deep burial. These bags must be **non-chlorinated** plastic bags.

*   **Type of Waste:**
    *   **Human Anatomical Waste:** Human tissues, organs, body parts, and fetus below the viability period.
    *   **Animal Anatomical Waste:** Experimental animal carcasses, body parts, organs, tissues.
    *   **Soiled Waste:** Items contaminated with blood or body fluids like dressings, plaster casts, cotton swabs, and bags containing residual blood.
    *   **Expired or Discarded Medicines:** Pharmaceutical waste, antibiotics, and cytotoxic drugs.
    *   **Chemical Waste:** Chemicals used in the production of biologicals and disinfectants.
    *   **Chemical Liquid Waste:** Liquid waste generated from laboratory and washing, cleaning, house-keeping and disinfecting activities.
    *   **Microbiology/Biotechnology Waste:** Laboratory cultures, stocks or specimens of microorganisms, live or attenuated vaccines.

*   **Treatment/Disposal:**
    *   **Incineration** (high-temperature dry oxidation).
    *   Plasma Pyrolysis.
    *   Deep burial (only in rural/remote areas).

### 2. Red Category
This category is for **contaminated waste** generated from disposable items that are **recyclable** (after sterilization). These bags must be **non-chlorinated** plastic bags/containers.

*   **Type of Waste:**
    *   Wastes generated from disposable items such as **tubing**, **bottles**, **intravenous tubes and sets** (IV sets).
    *   **Catheters**.
    *   **Urine bags**.
    *   **Syringes** (without needles and fixed needle syringes).
    *   **Vacutainers** with their needles cut.
    *   **Gloves**.

*   **Treatment/Disposal:**
    *   **Autoclaving**, Micro-waving, or Hydroclaving followed by **Shredding/Mutilation**.
    *   The treated waste is then sent to registered or authorized **recyclers** for energy recovery or plastics to diesel/fuel oil or road making.
    *   *Note: Red bag waste should never be incinerated as it contains chlorinated plastics which release toxic dioxins/furans.*

### 3. White (Translucent) Category
This category is strictly for **waste sharps** including metals. The container must be **puncture-proof**, **leak-proof**, and **tamper-proof**.

*   **Type of Waste:**
    *   **Needles**.
    *   Syringes with fixed needles.
    *   Needles from needle tip cutter or burner.
    *   **Scalpels**, **Blades**.
    *   Any other contaminated sharp object that may cause puncture and cuts.

*   **Treatment/Disposal:**
    *   **Autoclaving** or Dry Heat Sterilization followed by **Shredding** or **Mutilation** or **Encapsulation**.
    *   Final disposal in iron foundries or sanitary landfills/concrete waste sharp pits.

### 4. Blue Category
This category is for **glassware** and metallic implants. The container is usually a **cardboard box** with blue colored marking.

*   **Type of Waste:**
    *   **Glassware:** Broken or discarded and contaminated glass including medicine vials and ampoules (except those contaminated with cytotoxic wastes).
    *   **Metallic Body Implants**.

*   **Treatment/Disposal:**
    *   Disinfection by soaking the washed glass waste after cleaning with detergent and **Sodium Hypochlorite** treatment.
    *   Alternatively, through Autoclaving/Microwaving/Hydroclaving.
    *   Then sent for **recycling**.

### Summary Table of Color Coding

| Color Code | Type of Container | Waste Category | Treatment Option |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Yellow** | Non-chlorinated plastic bag | Human/Animal anatomical waste, Soiled waste, Expired medicines, Chemical waste, Microbiology waste | **Incineration** / Deep burial |
| **Red** | Non-chlorinated plastic bag/container | Contaminated waste (Recyclable): Tubing, Bottles, IV sets, Urine bags, Gloves | **Autoclaving** / Microwaving $\rightarrow$ Shredding $\rightarrow$ Recycling |
| **White** | Puncture-proof, Leak-proof, Translucent container | **Waste Sharps**: Needles, Syringes with fixed needles, Scalpels, Blades | **Autoclaving** / Dry Heat $\rightarrow$ Shredding / Encapsulation |
| **Blue** | Cardboard box with blue marking | **Glassware** (Broken/Discarded), **Metallic Body Implants** | Disinfection (Sodium Hypochlorite) / Autoclaving $\rightarrow$ Recycling |

*(Note: [[General Waste]] like food waste, fruit peels, and packaging material goes into the **Black** bag/bin for municipal landfill disposal, though it is not technically a "biomedical" category under the strict 4-color BMW classification)*.

### Mnemonics for BMW Segregation

*   **Y**ellow = **Y**ucky (Flesh, blood, pus, anatomical parts) or **Y**ellow = **J**ala do (Incinerate).
*   **R**ed = **R**ecyclable (Plastics, rubber, tubes) or **R**ed = **R**ough (Shredding).
*   **W**hite = **W**eapons (Sharps that can hurt you like needles/blades) or **W**hite = **W**ounded (by sharps).
*   **B**lue = **B**roken Glass or **B**ody Implants (Metals).

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Safety:** Proper segregation prevents [[Needle Stick Injuries]] and transmission of blood-borne pathogens like HIV and Hepatitis B among healthcare workers and waste handlers.
*   **Environmental Protection:** Preventing the incineration of chlorinated plastics (Red bag items) stops the release of carcinogenic dioxins and furans into the atmosphere.
*   **Infection Control:** Ensures that highly infectious waste (Yellow) is incinerated and removed from the ecosystem completely.
