# [[Communicable Diseases - Respiratory Infections]] > Measles

# Measles (Rubeola)

**Measles** is an acute, highly infectious viral disease of childhood, characterized by fever, coryza, cough, conjunctivitis, and a specific maculopapular rash. It is a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in developing countries.

### 1. Epidemiological Determinants

**A. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** [[RNA Paramyxovirus]] (Genus: Morbillivirus).
*   **Serotype:** Only **one** serotype exists (infection confers lifelong immunity).
*   **Survival:** Virus is heat labile; survives only for a short time outside the human body.
*   **Reservoir:** **Human cases** are the only reservoir.
*   **Carrier State:** **No carrier state** is known to occur (unlike Typhoid or Diphtheria).
*   **Infective Material:** Secretions of the nose, throat, and respiratory tract.

**B. Host Factors**
*   **Age:** Primarily affects children (6 months to 3 years in developing countries).
    *   *Note:* Incidence is rare < 6 months due to protection by maternal antibodies.
*   **Immunity:** One attack gives **lifelong immunity**.
*   **Nutrition:** Severe in malnourished children (mortality up to 400x higher). Measles can precipitate [[Protein Energy Malnutrition]] (PEM) and Vitamin A deficiency.

**C. Environmental Factors**
*   **Seasonality:** In India, epidemics usually occur in **winter and early spring** (Jan–April).
*   **Overcrowding:** Enhances transmission.

### 2. Transmission Dynamics

*   **Mode of Transmission:**
    *   Direct person-to-person contact.
    *   **Droplet infection** and **droplet nuclei** (Airborne).
    *   Portal of entry: Respiratory tract or conjunctiva.
*   **Incubation Period:**
    *   **10 days** from exposure to onset of fever.
    *   **14 days** from exposure to appearance of rash.
    *   *Note:* Vaccine-induced measles has a shorter IP (~7 days).
*   **Period of Communicability:**
    *   Highly infectious.
    *   **4 days before** to **5 days after** the appearance of the rash.
*   **Secondary Attack Rate:** **> 80%** (Very high).

### 3. Clinical Features

The natural history involves three stages:

**I. Prodromal (Pre-eruptive) Stage:**
*   Lasts 3–4 days.
*   Characterized by high fever and the **3 C's**:
    *   **C**ough
    *   **C**oryza (Runny nose)
    *   **C**onjunctivitis (Red, watery eyes, photophobia).
*   **[[Koplik's Spots]] (Pathognomonic):**
    *   Appear 1–2 days *before* the rash.
    *   Small, bluish-white spots on a red base (resemble **grains of salt**).
    *   Location: Buccal mucosa opposite the **lower second molars** (as per Park).

**II. Eruptive Stage:**
*   **Rash:** Typical dusky-red **maculopapular rash**.
*   **Progression:** Begins **behind the ears** (retro-auricular) $\rightarrow$ spreads to face/neck $\rightarrow$ trunk $\rightarrow$ limbs (within 2-3 days).
*   Fever rises with the appearance of the rash.

**III. Post-Measles Stage:**
*   Rash fades in the same order of appearance.
*   Leaves **brownish discoloration** and fine desquamation.
*   Child remains weak; weight loss occurs.

### 4. Diagnosis

*   **Clinical:** Fever + Rash + Cough/Coryza/Conjunctivitis + Koplik’s spots.
*   **Laboratory:**
    *   Detection of **measles-specific IgM antibodies** (ELISA) in serum (collected 4-28 days post-rash).
    *   Virus isolation (RT-PCR) from throat/nasopharyngeal swabs.

### 5. Complications

Measles suppresses immunity (anergy), leading to secondary infections.

| System | Complication | Clinical Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Respiratory** | **Pneumonia** | **Most common cause of death** (associated with 50-80% of measles deaths). |
| **ENT** | **Otitis Media** | **Most common complication** in young children. |
| **GI** | Diarrhea | Common; can lead to malnutrition. |
| **Neurological** | Encephalitis | Occurs in 1/1000 cases. |
| **Ocular** | Keratomalacia | Due to acute [[Vitamin A deficiency]], leading to blindness. |
| **Rare/Late** | **SSPE** | **Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis**. Rare, fatal degenerative CNS disease occurring 7–10 years after infection. |

---

### 6. Treatment

There is no specific antiviral drug for measles. Management is **supportive**.

1.  **Isolation:** For 7 days after the onset of rash.
2.  **Supportive Care:** Antipyretics for fever, fluids for hydration, nutritional support.
3.  **[[Vitamin A]] Supplementation:** **Mandatory** to prevent blindness and reduce mortality.

**Vitamin A Dosage Schedule (Oral)**

| Age Group | Dose | Timing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **< 6 months** | 50,000 IU | Immediately on diagnosis |
| **6 – 12 months** | 1,00,000 IU | Immediately on diagnosis |
| **> 12 months** | 2,00,000 IU | Immediately on diagnosis |
| *Follow up* | Same dose | Repeated the **next day** |

*(Note: If clinical signs of Vitamin A deficiency are present, a third dose is given 4-6 weeks later).*

### 7. Prevention: Immunization

Measles is preventable by vaccination. It is a part of the **Universal Immunization Programme (UIP)**.

**Measles / MR Vaccine:**
*   **Type:** **Live Attenuated** (Lyophilized/Freeze-dried).
*   **Strain:** **Edmonston-Zagreb** strain (most common in India).
*   **Dose:** **0.5 ml**.
*   **Route:** **Subcutaneous** (SC).
*   **Site:** Right upper arm.
*   **Diluent:** **Distilled water** (must be used within **4 hours** of reconstitution - **No Open Vial Policy**).
*   **Storage:** +2 to +8°C.

**Schedule (National Immunization Schedule):**
1.  **1st Dose:** At **9 completed months** (9-12 months).
    *   *Why 9 months?* Maternal antibodies neutralize the vaccine before this age.
2.  **2nd Dose:** At **16-24 months** (given as MR/MMR).

**Contraindications:**
*   Pregnancy.
*   Severe immunosuppression (e.g., symptomatic HIV).
*   Severe reaction to a previous dose.

**Outbreak Control:**
*   **Isolation:** 7 days post-rash.
*   **Immunization of Contacts:** Vaccine is effective if given within **3 days** (72 hours) of exposure.
*   **Immunoglobulin:** Human Ig can be given within **3-4 days** of exposure to high-risk contacts (pregnant women, infants <6 months) for whom vaccine is contraindicated.

### 8. Mnemonics & Clinical Pearls 💡

*   **Mnemonic for Clinical Features:** The **3 C's**: **C**ough, **C**oryza, **C**onjunctivitis.
*   **Mnemonic for Koplik's Spots:** **"Table Salt Crystals"** on a red base.
*   **Clinical Pearl:** Measles does **NOT** show the **Iceberg Phenomenon**. Most cases are clinically apparent (Tip of the iceberg constitutes the bulk).
*   **Strategy:** The WHO strategy for elimination is **"Catch up, Keep up, Follow up"**.
