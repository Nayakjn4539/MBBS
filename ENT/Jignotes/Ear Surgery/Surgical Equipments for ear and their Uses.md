# Surgical Instruments for Ear Surgery

### 1. Diagnostic and Pre-operative Instruments

These instruments are essential for examination, diagnosis, and minor OPD procedures before taking the patient to the operating theatre.

#### A. Head Mirror and Bull's Eye Lamp
*   **Structure:** A concave mirror with a central hole of **19 mm** diameter and a focal length of approximately **25 cm**.
*   **Use:** Reflects light from the [[Bull's Eye Lamp]] (placed at the level of the patient's left shoulder) to the part being examined.
*   **Clinical Implication:** It provides **hands-free illumination** and allows binocular vision, essential for depth perception in the narrow ear canal.

#### B. Otoscope
*   **Structure:** An electric/battery-operated device with a magnifying lens and a light source.
*   **Use:** Detailed examination of the [[External Auditory Canal]] (EAC) and [[Tympanic Membrane]].
*   **Clinical Implication:** Essential for examining infants, children, or bedridden patients where a head mirror is difficult to use.

#### C. Siegel’s Pneumatic Speculum
*   **Structure:** A speculum fitted with a convex lens (2.5x magnification) and a rubber bulb/tube.
*   **Uses:**
    1.  **Magnification:** Detailed view of the TM.
    2.  **Mobility Testing:** Assesses TM mobility (restricted in fluid/adhesions).
    3.  **Fistula Test:** Elicits fistula sign in labyrinthine fistula.
    4.  **Medication:** To push antibiotic drops/powder into the middle ear through a perforation.

#### D. Tuning Forks
*   **Structure:** Metallic alloy with a base plate, stem, and two prongs.
*   **Frequencies:** Commonly used are **256 Hz, 512 Hz, and 1024 Hz** (speech frequencies).
*   **Use:** Differentiating [[Conductive Hearing Loss]] from [[Sensorineural Hearing Loss]] via Rinne and Weber tests.

#### E. Jobson-Horne Probe
*   **Structure:** Double-ended instrument. One end is a **ring curette**, and the other is a **serrated probe**.
*   **Uses:**
    *   **Ring end:** Removal of wax, foreign bodies, or debris.
    *   **Serrated end:** Used as a cotton carrier (to make a wick) for cleaning discharge or applying medicament.

### 2. Surgical Retractors

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw Mollison's retractor showing 4x4 prongs and Lempert's retractor showing the central blade

| Instrument | Features | Primary Uses |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mollison’s Self-retaining Retractor** | Curved/angled self-retaining retractor with 4x4 sharp prongs. **Haemostatic** by pressure. | [[Cortical Mastoidectomy]], elevating flaps, holding soft tissue apart. |
| **Jansen’s Mastoid Retractor** | Similar to Mollison's but usually has 3x3 prongs. | Mastoidectomy. |
| **Lempert’s Endaural Retractor** | Has **3 blades**: two lateral blades for skin flaps and a **central blade** (adjustable) to retract the temporalis muscle. | **Endaural approach** surgeries (e.g., limited mastoidectomy, stapes surgery). |

### 3. Bone Cutting and Drilling Instruments

Modern ear surgery relies heavily on electrical drills, but manual instruments remain relevant for specific steps or when drills are unavailable.

#### A. Mastoid Gouges and Chisels
*   **Structure:** **Gouges** have a concave cutting edge (grooved); **Chisels** have a straight/beveled cutting edge. They are hammered with a **Mallet**.
*   **Use:** Removing the mastoid cortex and air cells (mostly replaced by drills now).
*   **Clinical Implication:** Still useful for harvesting bone dust/chips or in [[Caldwell-Luc Operation]].

#### B. Curettes and Scoops
*   **Lempert’s Scoop:** Oval/elongated scoop for removing bony septa and granulations.
*   **Macewen’s Curette and Cell Seeker:** Double-ended. One end (probe) **seeks** the antrum/aditus; the other (scoop) removes diseased cells.
    *   *Warning:* Careful use required near the aditus to prevent [[Incus]] dislocation.

#### C. Rongeurs (Bone Nibblers)
*   **Types:** **Lempert's**, **Beyer's**, **Kerrison's**.
*   **Use:** Removing overhangs, widening the aditus or bony canal wall piecemeal.

#### D. Surgical Burrs (Drill Bits)
Used with a micromotor engine.

| Burr Type | Appearance | Function | Clinical Safety |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cutting Burr** | Sharp flutes/blades. | Rapid bone removal, saucerization. | **Dangerous** near vital structures (Facial nerve, Dura). |
| **Diamond Burr** | Smooth, grit surface. | Polishing bone, hemostasis (bone dust blocks canaliculi). | **Safe** for working near the **Facial Nerve**, **Sigmoid Sinus**, and **Dura**. |

> **Mnemonic for Burrs:**
> **D**iamond is **D**ull (smooth) and **D**efensive (safe).
> **C**utting is **C**oarse and **C**ut-throat (dangerous).

### 4. Microsurgical Instruments (Middle Ear & Stapes)

These instruments are delicate, usually held like a pen, and used under an operating microscope.

#### A. Forceps
*   **Crocodile (Alligator) Forceps:** Fine forceps with a long shaft and small jaws.
    *   **Use:** Manipulating ossicles, inserting Teflon pistons, removing debris/granulations.
*   **Cup Forceps:** Cup-shaped jaws for removing tissue/polyps.

#### B. Micro-Scissors (Bellucci)
*   **Use:** Cutting the **stapedius tendon** during stapedectomy, cutting adhesions, or trimming grafts.

#### C. Picks and Perforators
*   **Straight Pick:** Creating a control hole in the stapes footplate.
*   **Angled Pick (45°, 90°):** Removing footplate fragments or manipulating the ossicular chain.

#### D. Suction Tips
*   **Zoellner Suction Tip:** Fine metallic tip with a thumb-control hole to regulate suction pressure. Essential for microsurgery to keep the field dry.
*   **Frazier Suction:** General ENT suction.

### 5. Specific Procedure Instruments

#### A. Myringotomy
*   **Myringotome:** A sharp, lance-shaped or sickle knife.
    *   **Use:** Incising the [[Tympanic Membrane]] (postero-inferior quadrant for ASOM; antero-inferior for SOM).
*   **Grommet (Ventilation Tube):**
    *   **Material:** Teflon, Silicone, Titanium. Shape: Bobbin/Reel.
    *   **Use:** Inserted after myringotomy in **Serous Otitis Media** ([[Glue Ear]]) to aerate the middle ear.

#### B. Tympanoplasty
*   **Periosteal Elevators (Farabeuf’s):** Used to elevate periosteum from the mastoid cortex.
*   **Sickle Knife:** For making canal incisions and freshening perforation margins.
*   **Ossicular Prostheses:**
    *   **PORP** (Partial Ossicular Replacement Prosthesis): Placed on stapes head.
    *   **TORP** (Total Ossicular Replacement Prosthesis): Placed on stapes footplate.

#### C. Stapedectomy/Stapedotomy
*   **Teflon Piston:** The most common prosthesis to replace the stapes.
    *   **Structure:** A loop (crimps onto incus) and a piston (enters oval window).
    *   **Size:** Diameter 0.4mm or 0.6mm; Length 4mm - 4.5mm usually.
*   **Measuring Rod:** To measure the distance between the long process of the incus and the footplate.

### 6. Miscellaneous Instruments

*   **Aural Syringe (Simpson’s):**
    *   **Structure:** Metallic cylinder with a plunger and nozzle.
    *   **Use:** Removal of **wax** and **non-hygroscopic foreign bodies**.
    *   **Contraindication:** Perforated TM, vegetable foreign body, acute infection.
*   **Eustachian Tube Catheter:**
    *   **Use:** To test patency of the [[Eustachian Tube]], inflate the middle ear, or instill medication.
