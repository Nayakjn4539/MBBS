### Juvenile Delinquency

**Juvenile Delinquency** refers to antisocial behavior by a minor (a person below 18 years of age) that, if committed by an adult, would be considered a crime. It embraces all deviations from normal youthful behavior, including being incorrigible, ungovernable, or habitually disobedient.

*   **Sex:** Incidence is significantly higher among **boys** (4 to 5 times more) than girls.
