# [[Diseases Of Retina]] > Hypertensive Retinopathy

### **Hypertensive Retinopathy**

[[Hypertensive Retinopathy]] refers to the retinal vascular changes resulting from systemic [[Hypertension]]. The retinal vasculature is unique as it allows direct visualization of the arterioles, providing insight into the systemic vascular status.

### **Pathogenesis**
The retinal changes evolve through three phases:
1.  **Vasoconstrictive Phase:** In response to elevated blood pressure, retinal arterioles undergo vasospasm (increased tone) leading to generalized narrowing.
2.  **Sclerotic Phase:** Chronic hypertension leads to thickening of the vessel wall ([[Arteriolosclerosis]]). This causes changes in the light reflex and compression of veins at arteriovenous crossings.
3.  **Exudative Phase:** In severe hypertension (malignant phase), the [[Blood-Retinal Barrier]] breaks down. This leads to leakage of blood and plasma, resulting in hemorrhages and exudates.

### **Clinical Signs**

#### **1. Arterial Changes**
*   **Arteriolar Attenuation:** Generalized narrowing of arterioles. The normal Artery:Vein (A:V) ratio is **2:3**. In hypertension, it reduces to **1:2** or **1:3**.
*   **Focal Narrowing:** Localized areas of vasoconstriction.

#### **2. Changes in Light Reflex (Arteriolosclerosis)**
Normal arterioles show a bright, thin central light reflex. With sclerosis, the wall thickens, and the reflex broadens:
*   **Copper Wiring:** The reflex becomes reddish-brown and broader (Grade 3).
*   **Silver Wiring:** The vessel wall becomes opaque and white, obscuring the blood column entirely (Grade 4).

#### **3. Arteriovenous (A-V) Crossing Changes**
Since arterioles and venules share a common adventitial sheath at crossings, thickening of the arteriole compresses the vein.
*   **[[Salus Sign]]:** Deflection of the vein at the crossing (S-shaped).
*   **[[Bonnet Sign]]:** Banking of the vein distal to the crossing.
*   **[[Gunn Sign]]:** Tapering of the vein on either side of the crossing.

#### **4. Extravascular Lesions**
*   **[[Retinal Hemorrhages]]:** Usually superficial **flame-shaped hemorrhages** in the nerve fiber layer.
*   **[[Hard Exudates]]:** Lipid deposits in the outer plexiform layer. Often arranged in a **Macular Star** pattern.
*   **[[Cotton Wool Spots]] (Soft Exudates):** Fluffy white lesions representing infarcts of the nerve fiber layer due to ischemia (interruption of axoplasmic flow).

### **Keith-Wagener-Barker Classification**

This is the most commonly used grading system to correlate retinal changes with the severity of systemic hypertension and prognosis.

| Grade | Features | Systemic Association |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Grade 1** | • Mild generalized **arteriolar attenuation**.<br>• Broadening of arteriolar light reflex. | Benign Hypertension |
| **Grade 2** | • Marked generalized narrowing.<br>• Focal arteriolar attenuation.<br>• **A-V Crossing Changes** (Salus Sign: Deflection of veins). | Chronic Hypertension |
| **Grade 3** | • Features of Grade 2 +<br>• **[[Copper Wiring]]** of arterioles.<br>• **[[Bonnet Sign]]** (Banking) & **[[Gunn Sign]]** (Tapering).<br>• **[[Flame-shaped Hemorrhages]]**.<br>• **[[Cotton Wool Spots]]** (Soft exudates).<br>• **[[Hard Exudates]]** (Macular Star). | Severe Hypertension |
| **Grade 4** | • Features of Grade 3 +<br>• **[[Silver Wiring]]** of arterioles.<br>• **[[Papilledema]]** (Optic disc swelling). | **[[Malignant Hypertension]]** |

### **Hypertensive Choroidopathy**
In young patients with acute, severe hypertension (e.g., [[Preeclampsia]], [[Malignant Hypertension]]), choroidal vessels may undergo fibrinoid necrosis leading to ischemia of the overlying [[Retinal Pigment Epithelium]] (RPE).

**Clinical Signs:**
1.  **[[Elschnig's Spots]]:** Black spots surrounded by yellow halos (infarcted RPE).
2.  **[[Siegrist Streaks]]:** Linear arrangement of hyperpigmentation along choroidal vessels.
3.  **Exudative [[Retinal Detachment]]:** Due to breakdown of the outer blood-retinal barrier.

### **Hypertensive Optic Neuropathy**
*   Manifests as **[[Papilledema]]** (Disc edema).
*   Seen in Grade 4 Hypertensive Retinopathy.
*   Result of vasoconstriction of peripapillary choroidal vessels leading to ischemia and axoplasmic stasis.

### **Management**
1.  **Control of Blood Pressure:** This is the primary treatment. Resolution of retinal signs may take up to a year.
2.  **Malignant Hypertension:** Requires controlled reduction of BP. **Avoid sudden precipitous drops** in blood pressure, as this may reduce perfusion to the optic nerve head and CNS, causing infarction/stroke.
3.  **General Measures:** Assessment of renal function, lipid profile, and cardiovascular status.
