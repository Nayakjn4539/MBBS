# Lasers in Glaucoma

Lasers are pivotal in the management of various types of glaucoma, functioning to either increase aqueous outflow or decrease aqueous production. The type of laser interaction varies (photocoagulation, photodisruption, or photothermolysis) based on the target tissue and laser wavelength.

## I. Laser Peripheral Iridotomy (LPI)

This is the definitive treatment for **Angle Closure Glaucoma** and prevents pupillary block.

### 1. Indications
*   **Acute Primary Angle Closure (PAC):** Definitive management after initial medical control of IOP.
*   **Primary Angle Closure Suspect (PACS):** Prophylactic treatment in eyes with occludable angles (narrow angles) to prevent acute attack,.
*   **Fellow Eye:** Prophylactic LPI is mandatory in the fellow eye of a patient presenting with acute PAC.
*   **Secondary Angle Closure:** Specifically cases with pupillary block (e.g., iris bombe, seclusio pupillae, aphakic/pseudophakic pupillary block),.
*   **Chronic Angle Closure Glaucoma:** To relieve any component of pupillary block.

### 2. Mechanism of Action
*   Creates a hole in the peripheral [[iris]], re-establishing communication between the [[posterior chamber]] and [[anterior chamber]].
*   Bypasses the pupil, relieving **pupillary block**.
*   Eliminates the pressure gradient between chambers, allowing the iris to fall back and opening the [[trabecular meshwork]],.

### 3. Procedure Technique
*   **Laser Used:** [[Nd:YAG laser]] (1064 nm) is preferred (Photodisruption). [[Argon laser]] (Photocoagulation) can also be used,.
*   **Site:** Mid-peripheral iris (preferably a crypt) between **11 o'clock and 1 o'clock** positions,.
    *   *Reasoning:* This superior location allows the iridotomy to be covered by the upper eyelid, preventing monocular [[diplopia]] or glare.
*   **Pre-treatment:** [[Pilocarpine]] is instilled 30 minutes prior to induce miosis and stretch/thin the peripheral iris.
*   **Parameters:** Power usually 3–6 mJ (depending on iris thickness). Hole size should be 150–200 microns.

### 4. Complications
*   **Transient IOP Elevation:** Common immediately post-procedure.
*   **Iritis:** Transient inflammation.
*   **Hyphema:** Bleeding from iris vessels.
*   **Corneal Burns.**
*   **Visual Disturbances:** Glare or monocular diplopia if the hole is not covered by the lid.
*   **Lenticular Opacities:** Localized damage to the anterior lens capsule.

## II. Laser Trabeculoplasty

These procedures target the [[trabecular meshwork]] to increase aqueous outflow. Primarily used for **Open Angle Glaucoma**.

### 1. Argon Laser Trabeculoplasty (ALT)
*   **Indications:**
    *   [[Primary Open Angle Glaucoma]] (POAG) uncontrolled by maximal medical therapy.
    *   Non-compliance with medications.
    *   [[Pseudoexfoliation glaucoma]] and [[Pigmentary glaucoma]],.
*   **Laser Used:** [[Argon green laser]] (514 nm).
*   **Mechanism (Photocoagulation/Photothermal):**
    *   Produces thermal burns at the junction of the anterior (non-pigmented) and posterior (pigmented) trabecular meshwork,.
    *   **Collagen Shrinkage:** Scarring and contraction of the treated meshwork stretches the adjacent untreated meshwork, opening the intratrabecular spaces and [[Schlemm's canal]],.
*   **Settings:**
    *   Spot size: 50 microns.
    *   Duration: 0.1 seconds.
    *   Application: 50 spots over 180° (semicircle) or 100 spots over 360°.
*   **Efficacy:** Lowers IOP by 8–10 mmHg. Effect tends to diminish over time (wearing off).

### 2. Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT)
*   **Indications:** Similar to ALT (POAG, Ocular Hypertension). Can be used as **primary therapy** or after failed ALT.
*   **Laser Used:** Q-switched frequency-doubled [[Nd:YAG laser]] (532 nm),.
*   **Mechanism (Selective Photothermolysis):**
    *   Targets intracellular melanin in pigmented trabecular meshwork cells.
    *   **Crucial Difference:** Does *not* cause thermal damage to non-pigmented cells or structural damage to the collagen architecture (unlike ALT).
    *   Triggers a biological response recruiting macrophages/endothelial cells to clean debris.
*   **Advantage:** **Repeatable**, as it causes minimal scarring.

### Comparison Table: ALT vs SLT

| Feature | Argon Laser Trabeculoplasty (ALT) | Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Laser Type** | Argon Green (514 nm) | Frequency doubled Nd:YAG (532 nm) |
| **Mechanism** | Thermal burn / Collagen shrinkage | Selective photothermolysis |
| **Target** | Junction of ant/post TM | Pigmented TM cells |
| **Scarring** | Present (Coagulative necrosis) | Minimal/Absent |
| **Repeatability** | Usually not repeated | Can be repeated |
| **Complications** | PAS formation, transient IOP rise | Transient IOP rise, mild inflammation |

> **Clinical Implication:** Apraclonidine (alpha-agonist) is often used pre- and post-laser to prevent the transient IOP spike associated with trabeculoplasty,.

## III. Cyclodestructive Procedures

These procedures destroy the secretory **ciliary epithelium** of the [[ciliary body]] to reduce aqueous production.

### 1. Indications
Reserved for refractory or end-stage glaucoma:
*   **Absolute Glaucoma:** Painful blind eye with high IOP,.
*   **Neovascular Glaucoma (NVG):**.
*   **Refractory Glaucoma:** Failed filtration surgeries (trabeculectomy/tube shunts),.
*   **Traumatic Glaucoma.**

### 2. Cyclophotocoagulation (Laser)
*   **Laser Used:**
    *   **Diode Laser** (810 nm): Preferred. Can be Transscleral (TSCPC) or Endoscopic (ECP),.
    *   **Nd:YAG Laser:** Used in thermal/free-running mode,.
*   **Mechanism:** Thermal destruction of the ciliary processes (photocoagulation) leading to decreased aqueous secretion.
*   **Advantages:** Less pain and inflammation compared to cryotherapy.

### 3. Cyclocryotherapy
*   **Mechanism:** Uses a cryoprobe (temperature -80°C) applied 3 mm from the limbus to freeze and destroy the ciliary body.
*   **Procedure:** Freezing for 1 minute over 180° of the globe.
*   **Disadvantages:** Significant postoperative pain and inflammation.

### 4. Complications of Cyclodestruction
*   **Phthisis bulbi:** (Shrinkage of the globe due to hypotony) – severe complication.
*   [[Sympathetic ophthalmia]] (Rare).
*   Anterior segment ischemia.
*   Chronic hypotony.

## IV. Miscellaneous Laser Procedures in Glaucoma

### 1. Laser Iridoplasty (Gonioplasty)
*   **Indication:** **Plateau Iris Syndrome** (Angle closure without pupillary block),.
*   **Laser:** Argon Laser.
*   **Mechanism:** Burns applied to the peripheral iris cause stromal contraction, physically pulling the iris away from the trabecular meshwork to open the angle.

### 2. Laser Goniopuncture
*   **Indication:** Developmental glaucoma; used to open the trabeculo-descemet membrane window after non-penetrating filtration surgery (like deep sclerectomy).
*   **Laser:** Nd:YAG laser.

### 3. Laser Suture Lysis
*   **Indication:** Post-trabeculectomy to cut scleral flap sutures and increase filtration if IOP is elevated.
*   **Laser:** Argon or Diode laser.
