# Measles Vaccination

[[Measles]] is a highly infectious acute viral disease affecting children. Vaccination is the primary strategy for prevention, control, and potential eradication. Under the [[Universal Immunization Programme (UIP)]], it is a priority intervention to reduce child mortality.

### 1. Vaccine Characteristics
The measles vaccine is a freeze-dried (lyophilized) preparation.

| Feature | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Type** | **[[Live Attenuated Vaccine]]** (Tissue culture vaccines: chick embryo or human diploid cell),, |
| **Form** | Lyophilized (Freeze-dried) powder, |
| **Strains Used** | **[[Edmonston-Zagreb]]** (Most Common in India)<br>Schwartz<br>Moraten, |
| **Appearance** | Before reconstitution: Pellet/powder form<br>After reconstitution: Clear liquid |
| **Sensitivity** | **Highly [[Heat Sensitive]]** (Thermolabile) and **Light Sensitive**, |

### 2. Administration Protocols (The "Rule of Right")

*   **Dose:** **0.5 ml**,
*   **Route:** **Subcutaneous (SC)**,
*   **Site:** **Right Upper Arm**,
    *   *Mnemonic:* **M**easles = **M**uscle is missed (Subcutaneous) on the **R**ight.

**Reconstitution:**
*   **Diluent:** **[[Sterile Water]]** or Distilled Water (supplied by manufacturer),.
*   **Storage after opening:** The reconstituted vaccine must be kept on ice/in [[ILR]] and **used within 4 hours**.
*   **Open Vial Policy:** **NOT APPLICABLE**. It falls under the category of vaccines that *must be discarded* at the end of the session or within 4 hours of reconstitution, whichever is earlier,.

> **Clinical Relevance:** Never use Normal Saline as a diluent for Measles vaccine as it may cause precipitation/clumping. Using the vaccine beyond 4 hours of reconstitution can lead to **[[Toxic Shock Syndrome]] (TSS)** due to bacterial contamination (Staphylococcus aureus),.

### 3. Immunization Schedule (NIS)

| Dose | Age | Remarks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1st Dose** | **9 completed months** (9-12 months) | Give **[[Vitamin A]]** solution (1 Lakh IU) orally along with this dose,. |
| **2nd Dose** | **16-24 months** | Given along with DPT Booster-1 and OPV Booster,. |

**Why is it given at 9 months?**
*   Before 9 months, maternal antibodies transferred across the placenta are present in the infant's blood.
*   These antibodies neutralize the live vaccine virus, preventing successful **[[Seroconversion]]**.
*   By 9 months, maternal antibodies disappear, allowing the vaccine to effectively stimulate the child's immune system,.

**Outbreak Schedule:**
In the event of a measles outbreak, a supplementary dose may be given as early as **6 months**. However, this dose is **not counted** as part of the primary schedule. The child must still receive the routine doses at 9 months and 16-24 months,.

---

### 4. Storage and Cold Chain
*   **Storage Temperature:** **+2°C to +8°C**,.
*   **Long-term Storage:** Can be stored at -20°C (freezing does not harm the lyophilized powder, but the *diluent must never be frozen*).
*   **Sensitivity:** It is very sensitive to **light** (stored in amber-colored vials) and **heat**. Reconstituted measles vaccine is the *most heat-sensitive* vaccine in the UIP,.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a vial of Measles vaccine with a Vaccine Vial Monitor (VVM) on the cap/neck indicating it does not follow Open Vial Policy.

### 5. Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI)

1.  **Mild Illness (Vaccine Reaction):** A mild fever and rash may occur **5 to 10 days** after vaccination. This is a mini-measles illness caused by the replication of the attenuated virus. It is self-limiting,.
    *   *Mnemonic:* **M**easles vaccine causes **M**ini-illness after **M**any (5-10) days.
2.  **Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS):** A cluster of symptoms (severe diarrhea, vomiting, high fever, shock) occurring within a few hours if a contaminated vial is used beyond 4 hours,.
3.  **Rare:** Thrombocytopenia, Febrile seizures.

### 6. Contraindications
As a live vaccine, it should generally be avoided in:
*   **Pregnancy**.
*   **Severe Immunosuppression** (e.g., symptomatic HIV/AIDS, malignancies, steroid therapy),.
    *   *Note:* In asymptomatic HIV infection, Measles vaccine *is* recommended due to the high risk of severe measles in these children.
*   **Severe acute illness** or high fever.

### 7. Measles Elimination Strategies
WHO recommends a 3-part strategy:
1.  **[[Catch-up]]:** One-time nationwide campaign targeting all children (usually 9 months to 14 years) irrespective of disease/vaccine history,.
2.  **[[Keep-up]]:** Strengthening routine immunization services to ensure >95% coverage of each birth cohort.
3.  **[[Follow-up]]:** Subsequent campaigns every 2-4 years targeting children born after the catch-up campaign.

**Recent Updates:**
*   **MR Vaccine:** India has introduced the **Measles-Rubella (MR)** vaccine in the National Immunization Schedule to treat both diseases simultaneously.
*   **Mission Indradhanush:** Aims to cover all partially vaccinated or unvaccinated children, with Measles being one of the key target diseases.
