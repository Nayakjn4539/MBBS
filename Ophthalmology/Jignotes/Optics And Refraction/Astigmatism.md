# Astigmatism

### Definition
[[Astigmatism]] is a type of [[Refractive Error]] wherein the refraction varies in different meridia of the eye. Consequently, the rays of light entering the eye cannot converge to a single point focus but form focal lines.
*   Ideally, the refractive surfaces of the eye ([[Cornea]] and [[Lens]]) should be spherical. In astigmatism, they are toric (like a spoon or a rugby ball).

### Etiology
Astigmatism can be classified based on the anatomical structure contributing to the error:

1.  **[[Corneal Astigmatism]]** (Most Common):
    *   Result of abnormalities in the curvature of the cornea.
    *   Can be congenital or acquired (e.g., due to [[Keratoconus]], corneal scarring, or pterygium).
2.  **[[Lenticular Astigmatism]]**:
    *   **Curvatural:** Due to abnormalities of lens curvature (e.g., [[Lenticonus]]).
    *   **Positional:** Due to tilting or oblique placement of the lens (e.g., [[Subluxation of Lens]]).
    *   **Index:** Rare; due to variable refractive index in different meridians of the lens.
3.  **[[Retinal Astigmatism]]**:
    *   Due to the oblique placement of the [[Macula]] (rare).

### Optics of Astigmatism: Sturm's Conoid
When parallel rays of light pass through a toric surface (astigmatic system), they are refracted differently in two principal meridians, forming a configuration known as **[[Sturm's Conoid]]**.

**Key Components of Sturm's Conoid:**
1.  **First Focus (F1):** The point where the rays from the more curved meridian come to a focus. Here, the cross-section is a horizontal line.
2.  **Second Focus (F2):** The point where rays from the flatter meridian come to a focus. Here, the cross-section is a vertical line.
3.  **[[Focal Interval of Sturm]]**: The distance between the two focal lines (F1 and F2).
4.  **[[Circle of Least Diffusion]]**: A point situated dioptrically midway between the two focal lines where the divergence of vertical rays equals the convergence of horizontal rays. The image formed here is a circle (though blurred).
    *   **Clinical Implication:** In [[Mixed Astigmatism]], the circle of least diffusion falls on the [[Retina]], often resulting in comparatively better vision than other types.

### Classification

#### 1. Regular Astigmatism
The two principal meridians are at right angles (90°) to each other.

**A. Based on Axis:**
*   **With-the-Rule Astigmatism (WTR):** The vertical meridian is more curved (steeper) than the horizontal meridian.
    *   *Correction:* Requires a convex cylinder at 90° or concave cylinder at 180°.
    *   *Mnemonic:* **With Cv** (Convex at vertical/90) or **Vertical Steep**.
*   **Against-the-Rule Astigmatism (ATR):** The horizontal meridian is more curved (steeper) than the vertical meridian.
    *   *Correction:* Requires a convex cylinder at 180° or concave cylinder at 90°.
    *   *Mnemonic:* **Against VC** (Vertical Concave/Minus).
*   **Oblique Astigmatism:** The principal meridians are perpendicular but lie at oblique axes (e.g., 45° and 135°).
*   **Bioblique Astigmatism:** The two principal meridians are *not* at right angles to each other (e.g., 30° and 100°).

**B. Based on Refractive Status:**

| Type | Definition | Position of Foci Relative to Retina |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Simple Myopic** | One meridian is myopic, other is emmetropic | One focus in front of retina, one on retina |
| **Simple Hypermetropic** | One meridian is hypermetropic, other is emmetropic | One focus behind retina, one on retina |
| **Compound Myopic** | Both meridians are myopic (unequal degrees) | Both foci in front of retina |
| **Compound Hypermetropic** | Both meridians are hypermetropic (unequal degrees) | Both foci behind retina |
| **Mixed Astigmatism** | One meridian is myopic, other is hypermetropic | One focus in front, one focus behind retina |

#### 2. Irregular Astigmatism
The refraction varies in multiple meridians, and the principal meridians are not perpendicular to each other.
*   **Causes:** Corneal scarring, [[Keratoconus]], [[Pterygium]].

### Clinical Features

**Symptoms:**
1.  **Defective Vision:** Blurred vision for both distance and near. Objects may appear elongated.
2.  **[[Asthenopia]] (Eye Strain):** Dull ache in eyes, frontal headache, and tiredness. Often worse in low degrees of astigmatism because the ciliary muscle constantly attempts to accommodate to place the circle of least diffusion on the retina.
3.  **Visual Disturbances:** Running together of letters while reading.

**Signs:**
1.  **Half-closure of lids:** The patient may squint (narrow the palpebral fissure) to act as a stenopaeic slit, cutting off aberrant rays.
2.  **Head Tilt:** Torticollis may be adopted to bring axes nearer to horizontal/vertical meridians.
3.  **Ophthalmoscopy:** The [[Optic Disc]] may appear oval or tilted.

### Diagnosis and Investigations

1.  **[[Retinoscopy]]**: Objective method. Reveals different refractive powers in two different axes.
    *   In keratoconus, a **scissoring reflex** may be seen.
2.  **[[Keratometry]]**: Measures the curvature of the central cornea. Essential for contact lens fitting and IOL power calculation.
3.  **[[Computerized Corneal Topography]]**: Most accurate for mapping irregular astigmatism (e.g., Keratoconus).
4.  **[[Astigmatic Fan Test]]**: A subjective test using a dial of radiating lines. The patient sees lines in one meridian more clearly than others.
5.  **[[Jackson's Cross Cylinder]] (JCC):** Used for subjective refinement of the power and axis of the cylindrical lens.
6.  **[[Stenopaeic Slit]]**: An accessory test where a 1mm slit is rotated in front of the eye to find the clear axis.

### Treatment

#### 1. Optical Correction
*   **[[Spectacles]]**:
    *   **Cylindrical Lenses:** Used to correct regular astigmatism. A cylinder has power in only one meridian (perpendicular to its axis).
    *   **Spherocylindrical Lenses:** Used for compound astigmatism.
*   **[[Contact Lenses]]**:
    *   **Soft Toric Lenses:** For moderate regular astigmatism.
    *   **Rigid Gas Permeable (RGP) Lenses:** Best choice for **Irregular Astigmatism** and [[Keratoconus]] as the tear film between the lens and cornea neutralizes the surface irregularity.

#### 2. Surgical Correction (Refractive Surgery)
*   **[[Astigmatic Keratotomy]] (AK):** Transverse or arcuate incisions are made in the mid-periphery of the *steep* meridian. This flattens the steep meridian.
*   **[[Limbal Relaxing Incisions]] (LRI):** Similar to AK but performed at the limbus; typically used during cataract surgery to correct pre-existing astigmatism (up to 2D).
*   **Excimer Laser Procedures:**
    *   **[[LASIK]] (Laser-Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis):** Can correct astigmatism up to 5D.
    *   **PRK (Photorefractive Keratectomy)** / PARK (Photo-astigmatic Refractive Keratectomy).
    *   **SMILE:** Can also correct astigmatism.
*   **[[Toric Intraocular Lenses]] (Toric IOLs):** Implanted during cataract surgery to neutralize pre-existing corneal astigmatism.

### Prescription Writing & Transposition
If a prescription is written as: **-2.0D Sph / +3.0D Cyl x 180°**, it can be transposed to an alternate form to verify lens availability or preference.
**Simple Transposition Rules:**
1.  **New Sphere:** Algebraic sum of old sphere and cylinder (-2.0 + 3.0 = +1.0D).
2.  **New Cylinder:** Change the sign of the cylinder (+3.0 becomes -3.0D).
3.  **New Axis:** Rotate axis by 90° (180° becomes 90°).
*   *Result:* **+1.0D Sph / -3.0D Cyl x 90°**.
