# [[Concept Of Health And Disease]] > Human Development Index and PQLI

### Physical Quality of Life Index (PQLI)

The **[[Physical Quality of Life Index (PQLI)]]** is a composite index used to measure the quality of life or well-being of a country. It consolidates three indicators to measure the results of social, economic, and political policies rather than just economic growth.

**Components of PQLI**
1.  **[[Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)]]**
2.  **[[Life Expectancy]] at age one**
3.  **[[Literacy]]**

**Calculation and Scale**
*   **Scale:** For each component, the performance of individual countries is placed on a scale of **0 to 100**.
    *   **0** represents the absolute worst performance.
    *   **100** represents the absolute best performance.
*   **Formula:** The composite index is calculated by **averaging** the three indicators, giving equal weight to each.
    *   $$PQLI = \frac{(Literacy Index + IMR Index + Life Expectancy Index)}{3}$$
*   **Result:** The final PQLI is also scaled from 0 to 100. The ultimate objective is to attain a PQLI of 100.

**Significance**
*   **Money is not everything:** PQLI does *not* measure economic growth (GNP/GDP). It demonstrates that high income does not always equate to high quality of life.
    *   *Example:* Oil-rich countries in the Middle East may have high per capita incomes but relatively lower PQLIs, whereas places like Kerala (India) or Sri Lanka have low per capita incomes but high PQLIs.
*   It measures the results of social, economic, and political policies.

> **Mnemonic for PQLI:** **L I L**
> *   **L** - **L**iteracy
> *   **I** - **I**nfant Mortality Rate
> *   **L** - **L**ife expectancy at age **1**

### Human Development Index (HDI)

The **[[Human Development Index (HDI)]]** is a composite index defined as a measure of achievements in the most basic human capabilities. It was developed by economists **Mahbub ul Haq** and **Amartya Sen** in 1990. It provides a more comprehensive picture of human life than income alone.

**Three Dimensions and Indicators**
HDI focuses on three basic dimensions of human development:

1.  **Long and Healthy Life (Longevity):**
    *   Measured by **[[Life Expectancy at Birth]]**.
2.  **Knowledge (Education):**
    *   Measured by **[[Mean Years of Schooling]]** (for adults aged 25 years and more).
    *   Measured by **[[Expected Years of Schooling]]** (for children of school entering age).
3.  **Decent Standard of Living (Income):**
    *   Measured by **[[Gross National Income (GNI)]]** per capita in PPP US$ (Purchasing Power Parity).

> **Mnemonic for HDI Components:** **L I K** (Like)
> *   **L** - **L**ongevity (Life Expectancy at Birth)
> *   **I** - **I**ncome (GNI per capita)
> *   **K** - **K**nowledge (Schooling years)

**Calculation Steps**
1.  **Creating Indices:** Minimum and maximum values (Goalposts) are set to transform indicators into indices between 0 and 1.
    *   *Formula:* $\frac{Actual Value - Minimum Value}{Maximum Value - Minimum Value}$
    *   *Note for Income:* The logarithm of income is used because decent standard of living does not require unlimited income.
2.  **Aggregation:** The HDI is the **[[Geometric Mean]]** of the three dimension indices.
    *   $$HDI = (I_{Life} \times I_{Education} \times I_{Income})^{1/3}$$

**Values and Interpretation**
*   **Range:** HDI values range from **0 to 1**.
*   **Categories:**
    *   **Low Human Development:** < 0.550
    *   **Medium Human Development:** 0.550 – 0.699 (India typically falls in this category, e.g., 0.645 in 2019).
    *   **High Human Development:** 0.700 – 0.799
    *   **Very High Human Development:** ≥ 0.800
