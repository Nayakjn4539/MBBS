# [[Health Information And Basic Medical Statistics]] > Presentation of Data

### **Introduction to Data Presentation**

Statistical data, once collected, must be sorted and presented systematically to be meaningful. The two main methods of presenting data are **Tabulation** and **Drawings** (Charts/Diagrams/Graphs).

### **1. Tabulation**

Tables are devices for presenting data simply from masses of statistical data. It is the first step before data analysis.

*   **Principles of Tabulation:**
    *   Every table must have a **Number** (e.g., Table 1) and a **Title** (brief and self-explanatory).
    *   Headings of columns and rows must be clear.
    *   Data should be presented according to size, importance, or chronology.
    *   **Footnotes** should be used if explanatory notes are needed.
    *   Vertical arrangement is generally better for scanning than horizontal.

*   **[[Frequency Distribution Table]]:**
    *   Used for large data sets where individual listing is impractical.
    *   Data is split into convenient groups called **[[Class Intervals]]**.
    *   The number of observations in each group is the **Frequency**.
    *   *Rules:*
        *   Class intervals should not be too broad or too narrow (ideally 6–16 groups).
        *   Intervals should be equal (e.g., age groups 0-4, 5-9, 10-14).
        *   Groups should be tabulated in ascending or descending order,.

### **2. Charts and Diagrams (Drawings)**

Visual presentations have a powerful impact on imagination and are easier to retain than tables. The choice of diagram depends on the type of data: **Quantitative** (Continuous) or **Qualitative** (Discrete).

#### **A. Presentation of [[Quantitative Data]] (Continuous)**

These variables have a continuous range (e.g., Height, Weight, Blood Pressure).

**1. [[Histogram]]**
*   **Definition:** An area diagram used for **continuous quantitative data** frequency distribution.
*   **Structure:** Class intervals are on the X-axis (abscissa) and Frequencies on the Y-axis (ordinate).
*   **Key Feature:** It consists of a series of blocks/rectangles. There are **no gaps** between the bars (unlike bar charts).
*   **Interpretation:** The **area** of the rectangle is proportional to the frequency.
*   > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Histogram with adjacent bars touching each other representing frequency distribution,.

**2. [[Frequency Polygon]]**
*   **Definition:** A linear representation of a frequency distribution.
*   **Construction:** Created by joining the **mid-points** of the histogram blocks at the height of frequencies with straight lines.
*   **Use:** Useful when comparing two or more frequency distributions on the same graph,.
*   > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Frequency polygon showing lines connecting the tops of histogram bars

**3. [[Frequency Curve]]**
*   **Definition:** When the number of observations is very large and the class interval is reduced, the frequency polygon loses its angulation and becomes a smooth curve.
*   **Example:** The **[[Normal Distribution Curve]]** (Gaussian curve) is a bell-shaped frequency curve,.

**4. [[Line Chart]] (Line Diagram)**
*   **Definition:** A frequency polygon presenting variations by line.
*   **Use:** Best for showing the **trend of events over time** (Secular trend).
*   **Example:** Trends of Malaria cases from 2010 to 2020, or IMR trends over decades,.
*   > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Line graph showing an upward or downward trend over years

**5. [[Ogive]] (Cumulative Frequency Diagram)**
*   **Definition:** A graph of the **cumulative relative frequency** distribution.
*   **Key Feature:** It is always an **uprising curve** (never goes down).
*   **Use:** Used to graphically determine **Percentiles**, **Quartiles**, and the **[[Median]]**,.
*   > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> S-shaped curve rising from left to right

**6. [[Scatter Diagram]] (Dot Diagram)**
*   **Definition:** Used to show the **correlation (relationship)** between two quantitative variables (e.g., Height vs. Weight).
*   **Structure:** X-axis = Independent variable; Y-axis = Dependent variable.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   *Line rising from left to right:* Positive correlation.
    *   *Line falling from left to right:* Negative correlation.
    *   *Scatter/No pattern:* No correlation.
*   > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Graph showing dots scattered to indicate correlation,.

#### **B. Presentation of [[Qualitative Data]] (Discrete)**

These variables are discrete counts or categories (e.g., Gender, Religion, Blood Group).

**1. [[Bar Diagram]]**
*   **Definition:** Visual comparison of magnitude of different frequencies in discrete data.
*   **Key Feature:** Bars are separated by **spaces**. The length of the bar is proportional to the frequency.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Simple Bar Diagram:** Represents one variable (e.g., Prevalence of TB in different states).
    *   **Multiple Bar Diagram:** Compares two or more variables (e.g., Immunization status of Males vs Females across years).
    *   **Component (Proportional) Bar Diagram:** Bars are divided into parts to show the composition of the total (e.g., A bar for "Total Deaths" divided into "Communicable" and "Non-communicable" segments).
*   > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Vertical or horizontal bars separated by space

**2. [[Pie Chart]] (Sector Diagram)**
*   **Definition:** Data presented as segments of a circle.
*   **Key Feature:** The area of each segment depends on the angle. Total angle is **360°**.
*   **Formula:** $\text{Angle} = \frac{\text{Class Frequency}}{\text{Total Frequency}} \times 360$.
*   **Use:** Shows percentage breakdown of a whole (e.g., Budget allocation, Causes of blindness). **Must always equal 100%**.
*   > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Circle divided into slices representing percentages,.

**3. [[Pictogram]]**
*   **Definition:** Use of small pictures or symbols to represent data.
*   **Use:** Popular for the **common man/layperson** as it is less mathematical. Least accurate but visually impactful.
*   **Example:** One doctor figure representing 1000 population,.

**4. [[Map Diagram]] (Spot Map)**
*   **Definition:** Shows geographical distribution of frequencies.
*   **Use:**
    *   Shows **clustering** of cases (local variations).
    *   Used to identify the source of infection in epidemics.
*   **Clinical Relevance:** **[[John Snow]]** used a spot map to identify the Broad Street pump as the source of the Cholera epidemic in London (1854),.
