# [[Agricultural Poisons]] > Organophosphorus Compounds

### **Organophosphorus Compounds (OPC)**

[[Organophosphorus Compounds]] are the most common cause of suicidal and accidental poisoning in developing countries like India. They are widely used as insecticides and pesticides in agriculture. They are powerful inhibitors of the enzyme cholinesterase.

### **1. Classification**

They are classified based on their chemical structure and toxicity.

| Group | Examples | Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Alkyl Phosphates** | HETP (Hexaethyl tetraphosphate), TEPP, OMPA | Highly toxic. |
| **Aryl Phosphates** | **Parathion** (Follidol), **Malathion**, **Diazinon** (Tik-20), Chlorpyrifos | Commonly used. Usually contain **Aromax** (petroleum derivative) as a solvent. |
| **Carbamates** | Carbaryl, Baygon | Similar action but reversible inhibition. |

### **2. Mode of Action**

*   **Mechanism:** OPs act by inhibiting the enzyme **[[Acetylcholinesterase]] (AChE)**.
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    1.  Normally, AChE breaks down [[Acetylcholine]] (ACh) into choline and acetic area at the synapse.
    2.  OP compounds phosphorylate the active site of AChE, forming a stable complex.
    3.  This leads to the **accumulation of Acetylcholine** at the nerve endings (Muscarinic, Nicotinic, and CNS sites).
    4.  **Aging:** If not treated early, the phosphorylated enzyme undergoes "aging" (loss of an alkyl group), making the inhibition **irreversible**.

### **3. Clinical Features (Signs and Symptoms)**

The effects are due to overstimulation of the parasympathetic, sympathetic, and somatic nervous systems.

#### **A. Muscarinic Effects (Parasympathetic Overstimulation)**
These appear early. Remember the mnemonic **DUMBELS**:
*   **D** – **D**iarrhea / **D**iaphoresis (Sweating)
*   **U** – **U**rination (Incontinence)
*   **M** – **M**iosis (Pinpoint pupils - characteristic sign)
*   **B** – **B**radycardia / **B**ronchorrhea (Excessive bronchial secretions) / **B**ronchospasm
*   **E** – **E**mesis (Vomiting)
*   **L** – **L**acrimation
*   **S** – **S**alivation (Frothing at the mouth)

#### **B. Nicotinic Effects (Sympathetic & Somatic Overstimulation)**
These occur due to accumulation at neuromuscular junctions and autonomic ganglia. Remember **MATCH**:
*   **M** – **M**uscle fasciculations / Weakness / Paralysis
*   **A** – **A**drenal medulla stimulation
*   **T** – **T**achycardia (Initial phase)
*   **C** – **C**ramps in muscles
*   **H** – **H**ypertension (Initial phase)

#### **C. Central Nervous System (CNS) Effects**
*   Headache, giddiness, restlessness.
*   Confusion, ataxia, tremors.
*   **Respiratory depression** and Coma.
*   Generalized convulsions.

### **4. Specific Syndromes in OPC Poisoning**

**1. Acute Cholinergic Crisis:**
*   Occurs within minutes to hours of exposure.
*   Features: The classic DUMBELS signs mentioned above.
*   Cause of death: Usually **Respiratory failure** due to bronchoconstriction, secretions, and respiratory center depression.

**2. Intermediate Syndrome (Type II Paralysis):**
*   **Onset:** 24 to 96 hours after exposure (after the acute crisis has resolved).
*   **Mechanism:** Dysfunction of the neuromuscular junction.
*   **Clinical Features:** Weakness of proximal limb muscles, neck flexors, and cranial nerves.
*   **Danger:** Can lead to sudden respiratory paralysis and death.
*   **Mnemonic:** **"Neck-Breathing-Proximal"** weakness.

**3. Delayed Neuropathy (OPIDN):**
*   **Onset:** 2 to 3 weeks after exposure.
*   **Condition:** Organophosphate-Induced Delayed Polyneuropathy.
*   **Features:** Distal degeneration of long axons. Causes paresthesia, cramping, and weakness of distal limbs (Foot drop/Wrist drop).

### **5. Diagnosis**

1.  **History:** Exposure to sprays or ingestion.
2.  **Smell:** Characteristic **Garlic-like smell** (due to Alkyl phosphates) or **Kerosene-like smell** (due to aromax solvent in Aryl phosphates).
3.  **Biochemical Tests:**
    *   **Serum Cholinesterase (Pseudocholinesterase):** Decreased levels (sensitive but less specific).
    *   **[[RBC Cholinesterase]] (True Cholinesterase):** Decreased levels (Specific indicator of nerve ending AChE).
4.  **Atropine Challenge Test:**
    *   Administer **1-2 mg Atropine IV**.
    *   If signs of atropinization (dilated pupils, tachycardia, dry mouth) *do not* appear, it indicates OP poisoning.

### **6. Management**

#### **A. Stabilization & Decontamination**
*   **Airway:** Clear secretions (suction is vital). Maintain patency.
*   **Skin:** Remove contaminated clothing. Wash skin with soap and water (OPs are absorbed through the skin).
*   **Stomach:** **[[Gastric Lavage]]** with potassium permanganate (1:5000) or activated charcoal.

#### **B. Specific Antidotes**
1.  **[[Atropine]] (Physiological Antidote):**
    *   **Action:** Blocks the effects of accumulated Acetylcholine at **Muscarinic** receptors.
    *   **Dose:** 2 mg IV stat, repeat double the dose every 5-10 minutes.
    *   **Endpoint of Atropinization:** Drying of bronchial secretions (Chest becomes clear), Dry mouth, Tachycardia (>110/min). *Note: Dilated pupils are NOT the primary endpoint.*
    *   **Maintenance:** Continue for 24-48 hours.

2.  **[[Oximes]] (Specific Antidote / Reactivators):**
    *   **Examples:** Pralidoxime (PAM), Obidoxime.
    *   **Action:** They reactivate the phosphorylated cholinesterase enzyme.
    *   **Timing:** Must be given **early (within 24-36 hours)** before the enzyme undergoes "Aging".
    *   **Effect:** Primarily reverses **Nicotinic** effects (muscle weakness/fasciculations) which Atropine cannot treat.

#### **C. Supportive Care**
*   Treat convulsions with **Diazepam**.
*   Antibiotics to prevent aspiration pneumonia.
*   Mechanical ventilation if respiratory failure occurs.

### **7. Autopsy Findings**

*   **External:**
    *   **Smell:** Kerosene or Garlic odor from mouth/nose.
    *   **Froth:** Excessive white/blood-stained froth at mouth and nose.
    *   **Cyanosis:** Deep blue discoloration of lips and fingers.
    *   **Pupils:** Constricted (Miosis).
    *   **Postmortem Staining:** Deep lividity.

*   **Internal:**
    *   **Stomach:** Mucosa is congested; submucous petechial hemorrhages. Contents usually greenish/brown with characteristic chemical odor.
    *   **Lungs:** Voluminous, edematous, congested. Cut section oozes frothy fluid.
    *   **Brain:** Congested and edematous.

### **8. Medicolegal Aspects**

*   **Suicide:** Most common cause of suicidal poisoning in agricultural communities due to easy availability.
*   **Accidental:** Common among farmers during spraying (inhalation or skin absorption) if protective gear is not used. Also seen in children consuming contaminated food.
*   **Homicide:** Rare due to the strong offensive smell and taste.
*   **Cattle Poisoning:** Often used to kill cattle.
