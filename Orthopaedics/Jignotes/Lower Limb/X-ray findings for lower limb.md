# [[Lower Limb]] > X-ray findings for lower limb

### Pelvis and Hip Joint

The radiological assessment of the pelvis and hip is critical for diagnosing fractures, dislocations, and developmental dysplasias.

#### Important Lines and Angles

| Line/Angle | Description | Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Shenton's line]]** | A continuous curved line drawn along the inferior border of the [[femoral neck]] to the inferior border of the [[pubic ramus]]. | Disruption or break in this line indicates **[[Dislocation of hip]]** or **[[Fracture neck of femur]]**. |
| **[[Trethowan's line]]** (Klein's Line) | A line drawn along the superior border of the femoral neck on an AP view. | Normally, it cuts through a portion of the femoral head. In **[[Slipped capital femoral epiphysis]]** (SCFE), the line passes superior to the epiphysis. |
| **[[Neck-shaft angle]]** | The angle formed by the axis of the femoral shaft and the axis of the femoral neck. | Normal range is **120°–135°**. <120° indicates **[[Coxa vara]]**; >135° indicates **[[Coxa valga]]**. |
| **[[Hilgenreiner's line]]** | A horizontal line drawn through the triradiate cartilages of the acetabulum. | Used as a baseline to measure the **[[Acetabular index]]** and locate the femoral head in **[[Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip]]** (DDH). |
| **[[Perkin's line]]** | A vertical line drawn at the outer edge of the acetabulum, perpendicular to Hilgenreiner's line. | In a normal hip, the femoral head lies in the lower medial quadrant. In **[[DDH]]**, it shifts to the upper lateral quadrant. |
| **[[Wiberg’s centre–edge angle]]** (CE Angle) | The angle between a vertical line through the center of the femoral head and a line from the center of the head to the outer acetabular edge. | Used to assess **[[Hip dysplasia]]**. Normal is >25°. An angle <20° indicates dysplasia. |

#### Structural Findings and Signs

*   **[[Lesser Trochanter]]**: On an AP X-ray, the lesser trochanter is usually visible. If the limb is in internal rotation, it may disappear or appear smaller. In posterior dislocation (limb internally rotated), the lesser trochanter is less visible. In fractures with external rotation, it appears prominent.
*   **[[Ward's triangle]]**: A triangular area in the femoral neck with sparse trabeculae. It becomes prominent in **[[Osteoporosis]]** due to the loss of tensile and compressive trabeculae.
*   **[[Singh's index]]**: A grading system (Grade I–VI) based on the visibility of trabecular patterns (principal compressive and tensile trabeculae) in the proximal femur to assess the severity of **[[Osteoporosis]]**.
*   **[[Crescent sign]]**: A subchondral radiolucent line seen in the femoral head, indicating subchondral collapse/fracture characteristic of early **[[Avascular necrosis]]** (AVN).
*   **[[Protrusio acetabuli]]**: The femoral head protrudes into the pelvis (medial to the ilioischial line). Seen in **[[Rheumatoid arthritis]]**, **[[Tuberculosis of hip]]**, or idiopathic conditions.
*   **[[Teardrop distance]]**: The distance from the femoral head to the pelvic teardrop; widening (>11mm or >2mm difference compared to the other side) suggests hip effusion or **[[Waldenstrom’s sign]]** in **[[Legg-Calve-Perthes disease]]**.

### Knee Joint

#### Important Markers and Lines

*   **[[Blumensaat's line]]**: A line drawn along the roof of the intercondylar notch of the femur on a lateral X-ray. It is used to assess the position of the **[[Patella]]**.
*   **[[Insall-Salvati Index]]**: Ratio of the length of the patellar tendon to the length of the patella. Used to diagnose **[[Patella alta]]** (high riding) or **[[Patella baja]]** (low riding).
*   **[[Fabella]]**: A small sesamoid bone sometimes found in the lateral head of the **[[Gastrocnemius]]** muscle. It can be mistaken for a loose body.

#### Fracture and Pathology Signs

*   **[[Segond fracture]]**: Avulsion fracture of the lateral tibial condyle/plateau. It is pathognomonic for an **[[Anterior Cruciate Ligament]]** (ACL) tear.
*   **[[Pellegrini-Stieda lesion]]**: Calcification at the medial femoral condyle (origin of the MCL), indicating an old injury to the **[[Medial Collateral Ligament]]**.
*   **[[Double arc sign]]**: Seen in a lateral view of the elbow (capitellum fracture), but a similar principle applies to specific condylar fractures where the articular surface congruity is disrupted. *Note: Specifically mentioned for elbow in sources, but concept of double contour applies to condylar overlaps.*
*   **[[Tunnel view]]** (Intercondylar notch view): Specifically used to visualize the intercondylar notch for **[[Osteochondritis dissecans]]** or loose bodies.

### Ankle and Foot

#### Ankle Mortise and Syndesmosis

*   **[[Mortise view]]**: An AP view taken with the leg internally rotated 15-20°. This prevents the fibula from overlapping the tibia and allows clear visualization of the **[[Talofibular joint]]** and **[[Tibiofibular syndesmosis]]**.
*   **[[Tibiofibular clear space]]**: The space between the tibia and fibula measured 1 cm proximal to the joint line. Widening indicates **[[Syndesmosis injury]]**.
*   **[[Medial clear space]]**: Space between the medial malleolus and the talus. Widening suggests deltoid ligament rupture or lateral shift of the talus.

#### Calcaneus and Foot Angles

| Angle | Description | Normal Value | Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Bohler's angle]]** (Tuber-joint angle) | Formed by the intersection of a line from the highest point of the posterior facet to the highest point of the anterior process, and a line tangential to the superior edge of the tuberosity. | **20°–40°** | The angle decreases or flattens (<20°) in **[[Intra-articular calcaneal fracture]]**. |
| **[[Angle of Gissane]]** (Crucial angle) | Formed by the downward slope of the posterior facet and the upward slope of the anterior process. | **95°–105°** | Distorted in depression-type calcaneal fractures. |
| **[[Kite's angle]]** (Talocalcaneal angle) | Angle between the long axis of the talus and the calcaneus on AP view. | **20°–40°** | Reduced (parallelism) in **[[Congenital Talipes Equinovarus]]** (Clubfoot). |
| **[[Meary’s angle]]** | Angle between the axis of the talus and the first metatarsal on lateral view. | **0°** (Straight line) | An angle indicating dorsal angulation suggests **[[Pes planus]]** (Flatfoot); plantar angulation suggests **[[Pes cavus]]**. |

### General Bone Pathology in Lower Limb X-rays

#### Tumor Appearances

*   **[[Codman's triangle]]**: Triangular elevation of periosteum at the periphery of a lesion. Indicates aggressive conditions like **[[Osteosarcoma]]** or **[[Osteomyelitis]]**.
*   **[[Sunburst appearance]]** (Sun-ray): Radiating spicules of bone perpendicular to the cortex. Classic for **[[Osteosarcoma]]**.
*   **[[Onion peel appearance]]**: Lamellated, layered periosteal reaction. Classic for **[[Ewing's sarcoma]]**.
*   **[[Soap bubble appearance]]**: Expansile, lytic lesion with internal trabeculations. Characteristic of **[[Giant Cell Tumor]]** (GCT) or **[[Adamantinoma]]** (tibia).
*   **[[Fallen fragment sign]]**: A piece of cortex falls to the bottom of a lytic lesion. Pathognomonic for a **[[Unicameral bone cyst]]** (Simple Bone Cyst).
*   **[[Shepherd's Crook deformity]]**: Varus deformity of the proximal femur seen in **[[Fibrous dysplasia]]**.

#### Infection Signs

*   **[[Sequestrum]]**: A piece of dense, dead bone separated from the surrounding living bone, seen in **[[Chronic osteomyelitis]]**. It appears radiopaque (white).
*   **[[Involucrum]]**: A layer of new bone growth outside existing bone resulting from pyogenic infection, surrounding the sequestrum.
*   **[[Cloaca]]**: An opening in the involucrum through which pus/sequestrum discharges.

**Clinical Implications:**
*   Always follow the "Rule of Twos" when evaluating lower limb X-rays: Two views (AP and Lateral), Two joints (joint above and below), Two limbs (for comparison in children), and Two occasions (some fractures like scaphoid or stress fractures appear later).
