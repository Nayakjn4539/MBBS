# [[Infections Of Bone]] > Neurological Complications of Pott's Spine

### Neurological Complications of Pott's Spine (Pott's Paraplegia)

**Pott's Paraplegia** refers to the neurological involvement (paralysis) associated with tuberculosis of the spine. It is a serious complication occurring in approximately 10-20% of cases of spinal tuberculosis. It is most commonly seen in tuberculosis of the [[thoracic spine]] (dorsal spine) because the [[spinal canal]] is narrowest in this region, and even a small amount of compression can lead to significant neurological deficit,.

#### Pathogenesis and Classification
The neurological compression arises from pressure on the neural tissues (spinal cord or cauda equina) by products of the disease process. The causes are broadly classified based on the time of onset relative to the active disease.

> Flowchart classifying causes of Pott's Paraplegia into Early Onset and Late Onset

**1. Early Onset Paraplegia**
This occurs during the active phase of the disease (usually within the first 2 years). It carries a better prognosis as the causes are often reversible.

| Cause | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Inflammatory Edema** | Vascular stasis and edema of the neural tissues due to adjacent inflammation. |
| **[[Extradural Abscess]]** | A collection of pus (cold abscess) compressing the cord from the front. This is the **commonest cause**,. |
| **[[Granulation Tissue]]** | Tubercular granulation tissue encircling the cord. |
| **[[Sequestra]]** | Loose pieces of dead bone or extruded [[intervertebral disc]] material displaced into the canal. |
| **Infective Thrombosis** | Thrombosis of the spinal vessels (anterior spinal artery) leading to [[spinal cord infarction]]. This causes rapid onset paraplegia with a poor prognosis. |

**2. Late Onset Paraplegia**
This appears many years after the disease has healed. The prognosis is generally poorer.

| Cause | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Internal Gibbus** | A severe kyphotic deformity creates a bony ridge on the anterior wall of the spinal canal, stretching the cord,. |
| **Fibrosis** | Peridural fibrosis or fibrous septae compressing the cord (healed disease). |
| **Recurrence** | Reactivation of the infection leading to new abscess or granulation formation. |
| **Stenosis** | Stenosis of the vertebral canal proximal to the deformity. |

**Clinical Implication:** In rare cases, an **extradural granuloma** may form without obvious bony destruction on X-ray. This presents clinically as a spinal tumor and is termed **[[Spinal Tumor Syndrome]]**.

#### Clinical Features
The onset is usually insidious but can be sudden (suggesting thrombosis or pathological dislocation).

*   **Motor Symptoms:** The earliest signs are usually motor weakness, awkward gait, and stiffness (spasticity).
*   **Sensory Symptoms:** Pain, paresthesia, or numbness.
*   **Autonomic:** Involvement of bladder and bowel sphincters occurs late in the disease process.
*   **Physical Signs:**
    *   **[[Clonus]] (Ankle/Patellar):** Often the first and most prominent early sign of cord compression,.
    *   **Hyperreflexia:** Exaggerated deep tendon reflexes.
    *   **Babinski Sign:** Positive (extensor plantar response).
    *   **Type of Paralysis:** Usually spastic in extension initially; progresses to spasticity in flexion, and finally flaccid paralysis in very late/severe stages.

#### Grading of Paraplegia
Grading is essential for monitoring progress and deciding management.

**Kumar’s and Goel's Grading System**,,

| Grade | Severity | Clinical Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I** | **Negligible** | Patient is unaware of the deficit. Physician detects **[[ankle clonus]]** and extensor plantar response (Babinski). |
| **II** | **Mild** | Patient is aware of the deficit but can walk with support. |
| **III** | **Moderate** | Non-ambulatory due to severe weakness. Paralysis in **extension**. Sensory deficit is < 50%. |
| **IV** | **Severe** | Severe paraplegia (Paralysis in **flexion**). Sensory deficit > 50%. Sphincter disturbances (bowel/bladder) present. |

**Frankel Grading (General Spinal Injury)**
*   **Grade A:** Complete (No motor or sensory function).
*   **Grade B:** Sensory only (No motor).
*   **Grade C:** Motor useless (Power < 3).
*   **Grade D:** Motor useful (Power 4-5).
*   **Grade E:** Normal.

#### Prognostic Factors
The outcome depends heavily on the nature of the compression and the duration of symptoms.

| **Good Prognosis** | **Poor Prognosis** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Early onset paraplegia | Late onset paraplegia |
| Slow progression of symptoms | Rapid onset (suggests vascular cause) |
| Active disease (Abscess/Granulation) | Healed disease (Fibrosis/Bony ridge) |
| Spastic paralysis (In extension) | Flaccid paralysis or Spastic in Flexion |
| Younger age group | Old age |
| Short duration of paralysis | Long-standing paralysis (> 6-12 months) |
| Sphincters intact | Sphincter involvement |

#### Management

**1. Conservative Treatment (Middle Path Regime)**
Popularized by **Tuli and Kumar**, this regimen advocates that nearly 90% of cases can recover with chemotherapy and rest, reserving surgery for specific indications,.
*   **[[Antitubercular Chemotherapy]] (ATT):** Multi-drug regimen (Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Ethambutol, Pyrazinamide).
*   **Rest and Immobilization:** Strict bed rest or plaster casts/spinal braces to support the spine.
*   **Monitoring:** Regular neurological assessment. If muscle power improves or returns, conservative treatment is continued.

**2. Surgical Management**
**Indications for Surgery (Absolute and Relative)**,:
*   **Neurological:**
    *   Paraplegia occurring *during* adequate conservative treatment.
    *   Worsening neurological signs despite ATT.
    *   No improvement in neurological status after 3-4 weeks of conservative care.
    *   Severe paraplegia (Grade IV) with rapid onset.
    *   **[[Cauda Equina Syndrome]]** (Sphincter involvement).
*   **Mechanical:**
    *   Severe kyphosis or progressive deformity.
    *   Spinal instability or pathological dislocation.
*   **Diagnostic:** Doubtful diagnosis (need for biopsy).

**Surgical Procedures:**
The goal is **[[Anterior Decompression]]** because the pathology (disease) is in the anterior column (vertebral body).

*   **[[Anterolateral Decompression]] (ALD):** The spine is approached from the side (usually via thoracotomy). The rib, transverse process, and pedicle are removed to access the abscess and granulation tissue anterior to the cord. This is the standard procedure for thoracic lesions.
*   **[[Costotransversectomy]]:** Removal of a rib segment and transverse process. Mainly used to drain a tense **[[paravertebral abscess]]** but offers limited access for bony debridement.
*   **Radical Debridement and Fusion (Hong Kong Operation):** Thorough excision of all infected material and reconstruction of the gap using bone grafts (strut grafts) to achieve fusion and prevent kyphosis.
*   **Laminectomy:** Generally **CONTRAINDICATED** in Pott's spine. Removing the posterior elements (lamina) in a spine where the anterior column is already destroyed causes severe instability and subluxation. It is only indicated in rare cases of isolated posterior spinal disease (spinal tumor syndrome).

**Clinical Implication:** Compliance with ATT and early detection of clonus are critical. Recovery of bladder/bowel function typically lags behind motor and sensory recovery.
