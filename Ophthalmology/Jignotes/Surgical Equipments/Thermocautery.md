### Thermocautery in Ophthalmology

**Thermocautery** generally refers to the destruction of tissue or coagulation of blood vessels using heat. In ophthalmic surgery, this is achieved through various devices ranging from simple heated probes to sophisticated electrical units.

#### Types of Cautery Used in Ophthalmology

There are two primary forms of cautery utilized in ophthalmic procedures: **Thermal/Heat Cautery** and **Wet-field Bipolar Cautery**. Additionally, **Chemical Cautery** acts on similar principles of tissue destruction but uses chemical agents.

**1. Heat Cautery (Thermal Cautery)**
*   **Mechanism:** Uses direct heat to coagulate tissue. The tip becomes red hot.
*   **Instrumentation:** Often consists of a handle with a platinum wire loop or a ball-point tip that is heated electrically or by a spirit lamp (historical).
*   **Application:** Applied directly to the bleeding vessel or tissue.

**2. Wet-Field Bipolar Cautery**
*   **Mechanism:** Uses high-frequency electrical current passed between two tips of a forceps (bipolar). It functions effectively in a wet field (presence of saline or blood) producing hemostasis with minimal charring or spread of thermal damage to surrounding tissues.
*   **Components:**
    *   **Bipolar Forceps:** Acts as the active electrode.
    *   **Console/Unit:** Generates the current.
    *   **Foot pedal:** Controls the activation.
*   **Clinical Utility:** This is the most essential and commonly used cautery equipment in the modern [[ophthalmic operation theatre]].

#### Indications and Clinical Applications

**A. Haemostasis (Stopping Bleeding)**
The primary use of cautery is to control bleeding during various surgical steps.
*   **Conjunctival Flap Preparation:** Used during [[cataract surgery]] (ECCE, SICS), [[trabeculectomy]], and [[enucleation]] to stop bleeding from conjunctival or episcleral vessels,.
*   **Scleral Incisions:** To achieve a bloodless field while making scleral grooves or tunnels.
*   **Extraocular Surgeries:** Used in [[squint surgery]] and [[pterygium]] excision to cauterize episcleral vessels.
*   **Eyelid Surgery:** To catch bleeding vessels during operations on lids and the [[lacrimal sac]].

**B. Tissue Destruction and Modification**
*   **Ziegler's Cautery Punctures:** Used for the treatment of **Medial Ectropion**. Punctures are made on the conjunctiva to induce fibrosis and tighten the lid.
*   **Punctal Occlusion:** Used for the treatment of severe [[dry eye]] syndrome. The puncta are cauterized to permanently block tear drainage and conserve tears,.
*   **Superior Limbic Keratoconjunctivitis (SLK):** Faint diathermy/cautery of the superior bulbar conjunctiva in a checkerboard pattern is a treatment modality.
*   **Marginal Chalazion:** Destruction by diathermy/cautery is the treatment of choice for a marginal [[chalazion]].

#### Chemical Cautery
While not a "device," chemical cautery is a crucial procedure in ophthalmology fulfilling the same purpose of tissue destruction.

**Common Agents:**
*   **Carbolic Acid (Phenol):** Pure carbolic acid (100%).
*   **Trichloroacetic Acid (TCA):** 10-20%.
*   **Iodine:** Povidone-iodine 5%.

**Applications:**
1.  **Non-healing Corneal Ulcer:** Cauterization of the ulcer base is done to remove necrotic material and stimulate healing. It acts as both a caustic and antiseptic agent,.
2.  **Chalazion Surgery:** After incision and curettage, the cavity is cauterized with carbolic acid to prevent recurrence. This must be followed by neutralization with methylated spirit.
3.  **HSV Keratitis:** Historically used (iodine cautery) before the advent of antivirals.

#### Clinical Implications & Safety

*   **Wet-Field Advantage:** Bipolar wet-field cautery is preferred in microsurgery because the current passes only between the two tips of the forceps, minimizing damage to delicate adjacent structures like the [[sclera]] or [[optic nerve]].
*   **Corneal Safety:** During chemical cauterization of a [[corneal ulcer]], care must be taken to ensure the acid does not touch the [[conjunctiva]], as it may cause adhesions (symblepharon).
*   **Punctal Stenosis:** A side effect of thermal cautery if applied inadvertently to the punctum during lid surgery; however, this effect is utilized therapeutically in dry eye management.
