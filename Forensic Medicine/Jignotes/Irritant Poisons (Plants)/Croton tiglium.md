# [[Irritant Poisons (Plants)]] > Croton tiglium

### **Croton tiglium (Jamalgota)**

**Synonyms:** Jamalgota, Naepala, Purging nut, Purging croton.  
**Family:** Euphorbiaceae.

---

### **1. Active Principles**
The toxicity is attributed to several compounds found in the seeds and oil:
*   **[[Crotin]]**: A [[toxalbumin]] (phytotoxin) similar to Ricin (from Castor) but less toxic. It is found in the seed kernel/embryo.
*   **[[Crotonoside]]**: A glycoside.
*   **[[Crotonic acid]]**: Found in the oil.
*   **Vesicating Resin**: The oil contains a powerful resin that causes blisters on contact.

> **Note:** The "press cake" (residue left after extracting oil) contains the toxalbumin [[Crotin]] and is highly poisonous. The oil acts as a drastic purgative.

### **2. Identification of Seeds**
The seeds are the most commonly encountered toxic part. They are often confused with Castor seeds.

| Feature | **Castor Seeds** (*Ricinus communis*) | **Croton Seeds** (*Croton tiglium*) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Appearance** | Glossy, Shiny, Polished | **Dull**, Non-shiny |
| **Surface** | **Mottled** (Mosaic pattern) | **Non-mottled** (Solid dark brown/black) |
| **Shape** | Oval, flattened | Oval, oblong, slightly quadrangular |
| **Caruncle** | Distinct caruncle (aril) at one end | **No caruncle** (or very small/inconspicuous) |
| **Size** | Smaller | Slightly Larger |

**Mnemonic for Identification:**
*"**C**astor is **C**rystal clear (Shiny and Mottled), **C**roton is **C**rude (Dull and Dark)."*

### **3. Mechanism of Action**
*   **Local Action:** It acts as a powerful **Vesicant** (blister forming agent) on the skin and mucous membranes.
*   **Systemic Action:** It is a **Drastic Purgative**. It causes severe gastrointestinal irritation leading to hypermotility and fluid loss.
*   **Cytotoxic:** [[Crotin]] inhibits protein synthesis (similar to Ricin), causing agglutination and lysis of RBCs.

### **4. Clinical Features**

#### **A. On Ingestion (Gastrointestinal)**
Symptoms appear immediately or within a few hours:
1.  **Burning sensation:** Intense burning pain in the mouth, throat, esophagus, and stomach ("Acrid taste").
2.  **Salivation:** Excessive drooling.
3.  **Vomiting:** Severe and persistent.
4.  **Diarrhea:** Violent purging, often bloody or watery (resembling **Cholera**).
5.  **Pain:** Severe colicky abdominal pain and [[tenesmus]].
6.  **Collapse:** Signs of severe dehydration (sunken eyes, weak pulse, hypotension), electrolyte imbalance, and shock leading to death.

#### **B. On Skin Contact (Dermal)**
1.  **Burning and Redness:** Immediate irritation.
2.  **Vesication:** Formation of painful blisters/vesicles.
3.  **Pustules:** The vesicles may turn pustular and eventually scar.

### **5. Fatal Dose and Fatal Period**
*   **Fatal Dose:**
    *   **Seeds:** 4 to 5 crushed seeds.
    *   **Oil:** 1 to 2 ml.
*   **Fatal Period:** 4–6 hours to 3 days (usually death occurs due to shock/exhaustion).

---

### **6. Management**
1.  **Stabilization:** Immediate attention to ABC (Airway, Breathing, Circulation). Treat shock aggressively with IV fluids (Ringer Lactate/Normal Saline).
2.  **Decontamination:**
    *   **Gastric Lavage:** With warm water or weak potassium permanganate.
    *   **Demulcents:** Administer egg whites, milk, or butter to soothe the inflamed mucosa.
3.  **Symptomatic Treatment:**
    *   **Opioids/Morphine:** To control severe abdominal pain and reduce intestinal motility.
    *   **Correction of Electrolytes:** Essential due to massive fluid loss from purging.
    *   **Skin:** Wash with soap and water; apply soothing lotions/steroids.

---

### **7. Postmortem Findings**
*   **External:**
    *   Traces of the seed or oil may be found on the lips or clothes.
    *   Vesicles or inflammation on the skin if external application occurred.
*   **Internal:**
    *   **GIT Inflammation:** The mucosa of the stomach and intestines appears congested, inflamed, soft, and edematous.
    *   **Erosions:** Submucous hemorrhages and ulceration/erosions may be seen.
    *   **Organ Congestion:** Liver, spleen, and kidneys show congestion due to toxalbumin effects.

---

### **8. Medicolegal Aspects**
*   **Accidental Poisoning:** Most common due to mistaken identity (confused with castor seeds) or overdose by quacks using it as a purgative.
*   **Abortifacient:** The root or oil is sometimes used to procure criminal abortion (severe GIT irritation reflexly stimulates uterine contractions).
*   **Arrow Poison:** Extracts used by tribal populations.
*   **Malingering (Artificial Bruise):**
    *   The juice/oil is applied to the skin to produce lesions that mimic a true bruise to bring a false charge of assault.
    *   **Differentiation:** An [[artificial bruise]] caused by Croton will show **vesicles/blisters** (due to chemical irritation), intense **itching**, and regular margins, which are absent in a true traumatic bruise.
