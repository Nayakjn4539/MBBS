# [[INTERNATIONAL HEALTH]] > Non-Government organization

### Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) / Voluntary Health Agencies

**Definition**
A [[Non-Governmental Organization]] (NGO) or Voluntary Health Agency is defined as an organization that is administered by an autonomous board which holds meetings, collects funds for its support chiefly from private sources, and expends money, whether with or without paid workers, in conducting a program directed primarily to furthering public health by providing health services, health education, or by advancing research or legislation for health,.

**Key Characteristics**
*   **Non-political** and non-official.
*   **Autonomous** administration.
*   Relies mainly on **private funds** (donations, subscriptions) but may receive government grants-in-aid.
*   Selfless service and flexibility in operation.

### Functions of NGOs
The specific roles played by NGOs in the health sector are broadly classified into the following functions:

1.  **Supplementing Government Work:** They fill the gaps where government services may be inadequate due to financial or statutory restrictions (e.g., [[Indian Red Cross Society]] providing relief during disasters).
2.  **Pioneering:** They explore new ways and methods. They often initiate research or programs (e.g., Family Planning was initiated by NGOs before the government adopted it).
3.  **Education:** They conduct health education campaigns (e.g., regarding hygiene, nutrition, or stigma reduction) which government agencies alone cannot fully cope with.
4.  **Demonstration:** They set up experimental projects to show efficacy. Once successful, the government may adopt them (e.g., [[Rockefeller Foundation]] demonstrated bore-hole latrines for hookworm control).
5.  **Guarding the Work of Government:** They act as watchdogs, guiding and criticizing government work to ensure quality and accountability.
6.  **Advancing Health Legislation:** They mobilize public opinion to bring about laws regarding health matters.

### Clinical and Programmatic Relevance in India

The Government of India actively involves NGOs in the implementation of National Health Programs:

*   **[[National Programme for Control of Blindness]] (NPCB):** NGOs (e.g., Lions Club, Rotary) conduct eye camps for cataract surgeries and eye banking,.
*   **[[National AIDS Control Programme]] (NACP):** NGOs are crucial for **Targeted Interventions (TIs)** among high-risk groups (sex workers, IDUs) where government reach is limited due to social stigma.
*   **[[National Leprosy Eradication Programme]] (NLEP):** Under the **SET (Survey, Education, Treatment)** scheme, NGOs assist in case detection and rehabilitation.
*   **[[Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme]] (RNTCP/NTEP):** NGOs act as DOTS providers and assist in counseling to reduce default rates.
*   **[[Janani Suraksha Yojana]] (JSY):** NGOs assist in identifying beneficiaries and facilitating institutional deliveries.
