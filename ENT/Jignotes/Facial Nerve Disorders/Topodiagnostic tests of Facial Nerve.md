# [[Facial Nerve Disorders]] > Topodiagnostic tests of Facial Nerve

Topodiagnostic tests are used to localize the site of a lesion involving the [[facial nerve]] (CN VII) within the temporal bone. These tests rely on the anatomical branching pattern of the nerve; by evaluating the function of specific branches (secretomotor, motor, and sensory), the level of the injury can be determined.

### **Anatomical Basis**
The [[facial nerve]] gives off three major branches within the [[fallopian canal]]:
1.  **Greater Superficial Petrosal Nerve (GSPN):** Arises from the [[geniculate ganglion]]. Carries secretomotor fibers to the [[lacrimal gland]].
2.  **Nerve to Stapedius:** Arises at the second genu (pyramidal eminence). Supplies the [[stapedius muscle]].
3.  **Chorda Tympani Nerve:** Arises from the vertical (mastoid) segment. Carries taste from the anterior 2/3 of the tongue and secretomotor fibers to the [[submandibular gland]].

### **1. Schirmer’s Test (Lacrimation Test)**
*   **Purpose:** Assesses the integrity of the [[Greater Superficial Petrosal Nerve]] (GSPN).
*   **Site Tested:** Lesions at or proximal to the [[geniculate ganglion]].
*   **Method:**
    *   A strip of filter paper (Whatman No. 41, 5 mm × 35 mm) is hooked over the lower eyelid fornix of both eyes.
    *   The patient closes their eyes for 5 minutes.
    *   The length of the wet portion is measured.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   **Normal:** Wetting of both strips is roughly equal.
    *   **Abnormal:** A unilateral reduction in wetting (less than 10 mm or a difference of >30% compared to the healthy side) indicates a lesion **proximal** to the geniculate ganglion.
*   **Clinical Implication:** A "dry eye" suggests a high-level lesion (e.g., labyrinthine segment or intracranial). A "wet eye" with facial palsy suggests a lesion distal to the geniculate ganglion.

### **2. Stapedial Reflex Test**
*   **Purpose:** Assesses the integrity of the [[nerve to stapedius]].
*   **Site Tested:** Lesions in the tympanic (horizontal) segment or higher.
*   **Method:** Performed using [[impedance audiometry]] or [[tympanometry]]. A loud sound (70–100 dB) is introduced to the ear to elicit the contraction of the [[stapedius muscle]].
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   **Absent Reflex:** Indicates a lesion **proximal** to the stapedial branch (assuming normal hearing and intact ossicular chain).
    *   **Present Reflex:** Indicates the lesion is **distal** to the nerve to stapedius (e.g., mastoid segment or extratemporal).
*   **Clinical Implication:**
    *   Loss of this reflex results in **hyperacusis** (normal sounds appear abnormally loud/painful).
    *   In [[Bell's palsy]], the return of the stapedial reflex is an early sign of recovery.

### **3. Taste Tests (Gustatory Function)**
*   **Purpose:** Assesses the integrity of the [[chorda tympani nerve]].
*   **Site Tested:** Lesions in the vertical (mastoid) segment or higher.
*   **Methods:**
    1.  **Chemical Method:** Drops of sweet, salty, sour, or bitter solutions are placed on the anterior 2/3 of the protruded tongue on the affected side. The patient must identify the taste without retracting the tongue.
    2.  **Electrogustometry:** An electrical stimulus is applied to the tongue. The threshold of taste perception is compared between the two sides.
*   **Interpretation:** Loss of taste (ageusia) or reduced threshold on the ipsilateral anterior 2/3 of the tongue indicates a lesion **proximal** to the takeoff of the chorda tympani.

### **4. Submandibular Salivary Flow Test**
*   **Purpose:** Assesses the secretomotor function of the [[chorda tympani nerve]].
*   **Method:**
    *   Small polyethylene tubes are cannulated into the Wharton's ducts (submandibular ducts) on both sides.
    *   Salivation is stimulated (e.g., with lemon juice).
    *   The number of drops or volume of saliva produced over 1 minute is compared.
*   **Interpretation:** A reduction of salivary flow by >25% on the affected side indicates a lesion **proximal** to the branching of the chorda tympani.
*   **Clinical Implication:** Considered one of the more reliable prognostic tests historically; severe reduction often correlates with poor prognosis in [[Bell's palsy]].

### **Localization of Lesion Based on Tests**

| Site of Lesion | Lacrimation (Schirmer) | Stapedial Reflex | Taste / Salivation | Clinical Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Suprageniculate** (e.g., Intracranial, Meatal, Labyrinthine) | **Reduced** (Dry Eye) | Absent | Lost | Total facial palsy, hyperacusis, loss of taste, dry eye. |
| **Transgeniculate** (At Geniculate Ganglion) | **Reduced** (Dry Eye) | Absent | Lost | Same as above. |
| **Suprastapedial** (Tympanic Segment) | **Normal** (Wet Eye) | **Absent** | Lost | Facial palsy, hyperacusis, loss of taste. Lacrimation is spared. |
| **Infrastapedial** (Mastoid Segment) | **Normal** | **Present** | **Lost** | Facial palsy, loss of taste. No hyperacusis. |
| **Infrachordal** (Stylomastoid Foramen / Extracranial) | **Normal** | **Present** | **Normal** | Pure motor facial palsy. |

> **Mnemonic for Branch Order:**
> **P**lease **S**ave **C**anaries
> *   **P**etrosal (Greater Superficial) – 1st branch
> *   **S**tapedius (Nerve to) – 2nd branch
> *   **C**horda Tympani – 3rd branch

### **Additional/Other Tests**

*   **Corneal Reflex (Blink Reflex):**
    *   Afferent: [[Trigeminal nerve]] (V1). Efferent: [[Facial nerve]].
    *   Touching the cornea normally causes bilateral blinking.
    *   In facial palsy, the direct and consensual blink is absent on the affected side (motor block), but sensation is intact.
    *   Used to localize lesion relative to the cerebellopontine angle (CPA). If the afferent limb is affected (absent blink on both sides when affected eye is touched), suspect a CPA tumor (e.g., [[acoustic neuroma]]) compressing CN V.

*   **Hitzelberger’s Sign:**
    *   Hypoesthesia (numbness) of the posterior meatal wall and concha.
    *   Due to compression of the sensory fibers of the facial nerve.
    *   Often a sign of [[acoustic neuroma]].

### **Clinical Note**
While topodiagnostic tests are excellent for anatomical understanding and exam purposes, they have largely been superseded in clinical practice by advanced imaging ([[HRCT temporal bone]], [[MRI]]) and electrophysiological tests ([[ENoG]], [[EMG]]) for determining prognosis and surgical planning.
