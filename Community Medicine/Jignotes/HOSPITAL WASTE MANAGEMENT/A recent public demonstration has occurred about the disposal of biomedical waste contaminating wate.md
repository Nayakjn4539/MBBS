# [[HOSPITAL WASTE MANAGEMENT]] > A recent public demonstration has occurred about the disposal of biomedical waste contaminating water body. As a BMOH what measures would you like to adopt for proper waste management of your hospital?

### Measures for Hospital Waste Management as BMOH

As the [[Block Medical Officer of Health (BMOH)]], facing a public demonstration regarding water contamination implies a failure in the **Liquid Waste Management** and potentially the general segregation protocols of the hospital. The following administrative and technical measures will be strictly implemented in accordance with the **[[Biomedical Waste Management Rules 2016]]**:

### 1. Immediate Crisis Management (Water Contamination Specific)
Since the primary complaint concerns the contamination of a water body, immediate focus will be on **Liquid Chemical Waste** (generated from laboratory washing, cleaning, housekeeping, and disinfecting activities):
*   **Stop Direct Discharge:** Immediately halt any direct discharge of untreated liquid waste into public drains or water bodies.
*   **On-site Pre-treatment:** Ensure all liquid chemical waste is pre-treated with at least **1% to 2% Sodium Hypochlorite** solution for a contact period of 20 minutes to ensure disinfection before it enters the drainage system.
*   **Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP):** Inspect the functionality of the hospital's ETP. The liquid waste must pass through the ETP to conform to the standards prescribed under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 before release.

### 2. Strict Implementation of Segregation at Source
Segregation is the key to effective management. "Mixing of waste is criminal." I will enforce strict adherence to the **Color Coding System** at the point of generation (wards, OT, Labs).

| Color Code | Type of Container | Type of Waste | Treatment/Disposal Option |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Yellow** | Non-chlorinated plastic bags | **Human/Animal Anatomical Waste**, Soiled waste (cotton/dressings with blood), Expired medicines, **Chemical Liquid Waste**, Microbiology waste. | **[[Incineration]]** (high temp >1200°C) or Plasma Pyrolysis or Deep Burial (in rural areas only). |
| **Red** | Non-chlorinated plastic bags/containers | **Contaminated Waste (Recyclable)**: Wastes generated from disposable items like tubing, bottles, IV tubes, catheters, urine bags, syringes (without needles). | **[[Autoclaving]]** / Microwaving / Hydroclaving followed by shredding and recycling. |
| **White** (Translucent) | Puncture proof, leak proof, tamper proof container | **Waste Sharps including Metals**: Needles, syringes with fixed needles, scalpels, blades. | Autoclaving or Dry Heat Sterilization followed by shredding/mutilation/encapsulation. |
| **Blue** | Cardboard boxes with blue marking | **Glassware**: Broken or discarded glass, Metallic Body Implants. | Disinfection (Sodium Hypochlorite) followed by recycling. |

*Note: General municipal waste (food, paper) goes into **Black bags** for secured landfill.*

> **Mnemonic for Segregation:**
> *   **Y**ellow = **Y**uck (Flesh, blood, pus, chemical sludge)
> *   **R**ed = **R**ecyclable (Plastics, tubes, rubber)
> *   **W**hite = **W**eapon (Sharps that can hurt)
> *   **B**lue = **B**roken (Glassware and implants)

### 3. Collection, Storage, and Transport
*   **Collection:** Waste bags must be removed when they are **3/4th full**. They must be tied securely; no stapling of bags.
*   **Storage:** A designated, secured central waste storage area must be maintained within the hospital premises.
    *   **Time Limit:** Untreated biomedical waste shall not be stored beyond **48 hours**.
    *   If stored longer, permission from the prescribed authority is needed, and measures must be taken to prevent foul odors.
*   **Transport:** Dedicated wheeled trolleys/covered carts must be used to transport waste from wards to the central storage area. These vehicles must not be used for any other purpose.

### 4. Administrative and Personnel Measures
*   **Establish a Waste Management Committee:** Form a committee comprising the Hospital Superintendent, Heads of Departments, and the Infection Control Nurse to meet monthly and review compliance.
*   **Training and Safety:**
    *   Conduct regular training workshops for all staff (doctors, nurses, and specifically **sanitary workers**) regarding segregation and hazards.
    *   **Personal Protective Equipment ([[PPE]]):** Ensure adequate supply of heavy-duty gloves, masks, aprons, and boots for waste handlers.
    *   **Immunization:** Mandatory Hepatitis B and Tetanus immunization for all waste handlers.

### 5. Monitoring and Record Keeping
*   **Bio-hazard Labeling:** Ensure all bags and containers carry the **Bio-hazard symbol** and **Cytotoxic hazard symbol** prominently.
*   **Log Books:** Maintain a daily register of category-wise waste generated (in kg) and handed over to the **Common Bio-medical Waste Treatment Facility (CBWTF)**.
*   **Annual Report:** Submit an annual report to the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) regarding waste generation and disposal.
