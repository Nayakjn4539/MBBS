# [[Screening For Disease]] > Yield of a Screening Test

### **Yield of a Screening Test**

**Definition**
The [[Yield]] of a screening test is defined as the amount of **previously unrecognized disease** that is diagnosed as a result of the screening effort. It represents the number of cases brought to light from the "submerged portion" of the [[Iceberg of Disease]].

**Factors Influencing Yield**
The yield is dependent upon the following key factors:

1.  **Prevalence of Disease:** This is the most important factor. The yield is directly proportional to the prevalence of the disease in the population. A higher prevalence results in a higher yield.
2.  **Sensitivity of the Test:** A test with high sensitivity detects more true positive cases, thereby increasing the yield.
3.  **Specificity of the Test:** While specificity relates to false positives, the overall diagnostic accuracy (validity) impacts the effective yield of *true* cases.
4.  **Participation of Individuals:** Even a highly accurate test will have a low yield if the population coverage or participation in the detection programme is poor.

**Methods to Increase Yield**
*   **Selective Screening (High-Risk Screening):** Applying screening tests to high-risk groups rather than the general population significantly increases the yield.
    *   *Example:* Screening for [[Diabetes Mellitus]] yields more cases if restricted to people >40 years, obese individuals, or those with a family history, rather than screening the entire population.
*   **Initial vs. Subsequent Screening:** Yield is generally highest during the *first* screening of a population (detecting the backlog of existing/prevalent cases). Subsequent screenings usually yield fewer cases (detecting only new/incident cases).

**Relationship with Predictive Value**
*   Yield is closely related to the [[Positive Predictive Value (PPV)]].
*   Like yield, PPV is also most affected by the **prevalence** of the disease.

**Clinical Relevance**
*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** A low yield implies a high cost per case detected. For a screening programme to be viable in a public health setting, the yield must be sufficient to justify the resources expended.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Yield helps health administrators decide whether to implement Mass Screening or High-Risk Screening strategies.

**Mnemonic: Factors Affecting Yield**
**"P-S-S-P"**
*   **P** – **P**revalence of the disease (Major factor)
*   **S** – **S**ensitivity of the test
*   **S** – **S**pecificity of the test
*   **P** – **P**articipation of the population
