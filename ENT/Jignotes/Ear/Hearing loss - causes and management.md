# [[Ear]] > Hearing loss - causes and management

# Classification of Hearing Loss

Hearing loss is broadly classified into three main types based on the anatomical site of the lesion:

1.  **[[Conductive Hearing Loss]] (CHL):** Interference with the transmission of sound from the external ear to the inner ear (stapedio-vestibular joint).
2.  **[[Sensorineural Hearing Loss]] (SNHL):** Damage to the pathway for sound impulses from the hair cells of the inner ear (Sensory/Cochlear) to the auditory nerve and the brain (Neural/Retrocochlear).
3.  **[[Mixed Hearing Loss]]:** Elements of both conductive and sensorineural deafness are present in the same ear.
4.  **Functional/Non-organic Hearing Loss:** Psychological causes or malingering with no underlying organic lesion.

### Degrees of Hearing Loss
*   **Normal:** 0–25 dB
*   **Mild:** 26–40 dB
*   **Moderate:** 41–55 dB
*   **Moderately Severe:** 56–70 dB
*   **Severe:** 71–90 dB
*   **Profound:** >90 dB

# Causes (Etiology)

### 1. Causes of Conductive Hearing Loss (CHL)
Any disease affecting the external or middle ear causes CHL.

*   **External Ear:**
    *   Congenital: [[Meatal atresia]], Microtia.
    *   Obstruction: Impacted [[Cerumen]] (Wax), Foreign bodies, Osteoma, Exostosis.
    *   Infection: Acute inflammatory swelling, Otitis externa.
    *   Tumors: Benign or malignant tumors of the canal.
*   **Middle Ear:**
    *   **Tympanic Membrane:** Perforation (Traumatic, ASOM, CSOM), [[Tympanosclerosis]].
    *   **Fluid:** [[Acute Otitis Media]] (AOM), [[Serous Otitis Media]] (Glue ear), Hemotympanum.
    *   **Ossicles:**
        *   Fixation: [[Otosclerosis]] (fixation of stapes footplate), Malleus fixation.
        *   Disruption: Trauma, ossicular necrosis (incus is most common) in CSOM.
    *   **Eustachian Tube:** Dysfunction or obstruction.

### 2. Causes of Sensorineural Hearing Loss (SNHL)
*   **Congenital:**
    *   **Genetic:** Syndromic (e.g., Waardenburg, Usher, Alport syndromes) or Non-syndromic.
    *   **Non-genetic (Prenatal/Perinatal):** TORCH infections (Rubella, CMV), Hypoxia, Hyperbilirubinemia (Kernicterus), Prematurity, Ototoxic drugs during pregnancy.
*   **Acquired:**
    *   **Infections:** Mumps, Measles, Meningitis, Labyrinthitis, Syphilis.
    *   **[[Presbycusis]]:** Age-related progressive SNHL (most common cause in elderly).
    *   **[[Noise-Induced Hearing Loss]] (NIHL):** Acoustic trauma (one-time exposure >140 dB) or chronic noise exposure.
    *   **[[Ototoxicity]]:** Drugs like Aminoglycosides (Streptomycin, Gentamicin), Cisplatin, Loop diuretics, Quinine/Salicylates.
    *   **[[Meniere's Disease]]:** Endolymphatic hydrops.
    *   **[[Acoustic Neuroma]]:** Vestibular Schwannoma (retrocochlear).
    *   **[[Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss]] (SSNHL):** Idiopathic, vascular, or viral causes.

# Diagnostic Methods

### A. Clinical Tests (Tuning Fork Tests)
These tests usually employ 256, 512, and 1024 Hz forks.

| Test | Procedure | Interpretation in CHL | Interpretation in SNHL |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Rinne Test]]** | Compares Air Conduction (AC) vs. Bone Conduction (BC). | **Negative** (BC > AC). | **Positive** (AC > BC). |
| **[[Weber Test]]** | Fork on midline (forehead/vertex). Checks lateralization. | Lateralizes to **Worse/Poorer** ear. | Lateralizes to **Better** ear. |
| **[[Absolute Bone Conduction]] (ABC)** | Patient's BC compared to examiner's (normal) BC with canal occluded. | **Normal** (Same as examiner). | **Reduced/Shortened**. |
| **[[Schwabach's Test]]** | Similar to ABC but meatus is *not* occluded. | **Lengthened**. | **Shortened**. |
| **[[Bing Test]]** | Effect of occlusion of ear canal on BC. | **Negative** (No change in loudness). | **Positive** (Sound louder when closed). |
| **[[Gelle's Test]]** | Effect of air pressure (Siegel's speculum) on BC. | **Negative** (No change = Ossicular fixation/Otosclerosis). | **Positive** (Hearing decreases with pressure). |

**Mnemonic for Weber Test:**
**"We Create Best Students"**
**We**ber: **C**onductive to **B**ad ear, **S**ensorineural to **B**etter ear.

### B. Audiometric Tests (Subjective)
1.  **[[Pure Tone Audiometry]] (PTA):**
    *   Measures threshold of hearing for AC and BC.
    *   **Audiogram:** Graphical representation.
    *   **CHL:** Air-Bone gap > 15 dB (BC normal, AC depressed).
    *   **SNHL:** No Air-Bone gap (Both AC and BC depressed).
    *   **Characteristic Dips:**
        *   **Carhart's Notch:** Dip in BC at 2000 Hz (Seen in [[Otosclerosis]]).
        *   **Acoustic Dip/Boiler's Notch:** Dip in AC & BC at 4000 Hz (Seen in [[Noise-Induced Hearing Loss]]).
2.  **[[Speech Audiometry]]:**
    *   **Speech Reception Threshold (SRT):** Minimum intensity to repeat 50% of spondee words.
    *   **Speech Discrimination Score (SDS):** Percentage of phonetically balanced words correctly heard. Poor in retrocochlear lesions (Rollover phenomenon).

### C. Objective Tests (Modern Equipment)
1.  **[[Impedance Audiometry]] (Tympanometry):**
    *   Assesses middle ear function, compliance, and pressure.
    *   **Type A:** Normal.
    *   **Type As:** Reduced compliance (Otosclerosis).
    *   **Type Ad:** Hypercompliance (Ossicular discontinuity).
    *   **Type B:** Flat curve (Fluid/Glue ear/Perforation).
    *   **Type C:** Negative pressure (Eustachian tube dysfunction).
2.  **[[Otoacoustic Emissions]] (OAE):**
    *   Checks function of Outer Hair Cells.
    *   Used for **Newborn Hearing Screening**. Absent in cochlear pathology.
3.  **[[Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry]] (BERA/ABR):**
    *   Measures electrical activity in auditory pathway (Wave I-V).
    *   Used for screening high-risk infants, threshold estimation in children, and diagnosing retrocochlear pathology (e.g., Acoustic Neuroma).
4.  **[[Electrocochleography]] (ECochG):**
    *   Diagnosing Endolymphatic hydrops ([[Meniere's Disease]]).

# Management and Cure Options

### 1. Medical Management
*   **Antibiotics:** Systemic/topical for Acute Otitis Media (AOM) or active CSOM.
*   **Steroids:** For [[Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss]] (oral or intratympanic) to reduce inflammation.
*   **Vasodilators/Carbogen:** To improve cochlear blood flow (e.g., in sudden SNHL or Meniere's).
*   **Decongestants:** For Eustachian tube dysfunction.

### 2. Surgical Management (The "Cure" for Conductive Loss)
*   **[[Myringotomy]] (+ Grommet Insertion):** Incision of TM to drain fluid in Serous Otitis Media.
*   **[[Myringoplasty]]:** Repair of tympanic membrane perforation only.
*   **[[Tympanoplasty]]:** Eradication of disease + Reconstruction of hearing mechanism (TM + Ossicles).
    *   *Ossiculoplasty:* Reconstruction of ossicular chain using autografts or prostheses (PORP/TORP).
*   **[[Mastoidectomy]]:**
    *   *Cortical:* For acute mastoiditis.
    *   *Canal Wall Up/Down:* For Cholesteatoma (unsafe CSOM).
*   **[[Stapedectomy]] / Stapedotomy:** Treatment of choice for **Otosclerosis**. The fixed stapes is removed/fenestrated and replaced with a Teflon piston.

### 3. Rehabilitation and Modern Equipment
Used when medical/surgical cure is not possible (e.g., SNHL).

*   **[[Hearing Aids]]:**
    *   **Air Conduction Aids:** Body-worn, Behind-the-Ear (BTE), In-the-Ear (ITE), Completely-in-Canal (CIC).
    *   **Digital Hearing Aids:** Programmable for specific frequency loss.
    *   **CROS Aids:** For unilateral deafness.
*   **[[Bone Anchored Hearing Aid]] (BAHA):**
    *   *Mechanism:* Transmits sound via bone conduction directly to the cochlea.
    *   *Indications:* Congenital atresia/Microtia, chronically discharging ears (cannot wear mold), single-sided deafness.
*   **[[Cochlear Implants]]:**
    *   *Mechanism:* Bypasses hair cells and directly stimulates the auditory nerve electrically.
    *   *Indication:* Bilateral severe to profound SNHL not benefiting from hearing aids.
*   **[[Auditory Brainstem Implant]] (ABI):**
    *   *Mechanism:* Stimulates cochlear nucleus in the brainstem directly.
    *   *Indication:* Retrocochlear lesions where auditory nerve is absent or damaged (e.g., Neurofibromatosis Type 2).
*   **Active Middle Ear Implants:** E.g., Vibrant Soundbridge. Drives ossicles directly via vibration.
