# [[Mechanical Injuries]] > Abrasions and its age changes

### Definition
An [[abrasion]] is a superficial injury involving the epidermis (outer layer of skin) and the upper part of the dermis, caused by friction, pressure, or impact against a rough surface. It generally does not penetrate the full thickness of the skin and usually heals without scarring (unless infection occurs or the dermis is deeply involved).

### Classification of Abrasions

| Type | Mechanism | Features | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Scratches** | Sharp or pointed object moves across the skin. | Linear injury; clean or jagged edges. May show **epithelial tags** at the end. | Pin, thorn, [[fingernail abrasions]] (crescentic). |
| **2. Grazes** (Sliding/Grinding/Brush burn) | Friction between skin and a broad rough surface. | Extensive superficial loss of epidermis. Parallel grooves/striae indicating direction. | Road traffic accidents (friction against road), dragging. |
| **3. Pressure Abrasions** | Perpendicular force/crushing of epidermis. | Parchment-like, dried, hard area. Minimal bleeding. Often reproduces the shape of the object. | [[Ligature mark]] in hanging/strangulation, teeth marks. |
| **4. Impact Abrasions** (Contact/Imprint) | Direct impact with a rough object. | Imprint of the object is stamped on the skin. | Radiator grill mark, tyre tread mark. |

### Mechanism and Direction of Force
The direction of force causing the abrasion can be determined by examining **Epithelial Tags** (Epidermal tags):
*   When a blunt object scrapes the skin, the epidermis is peeled off.
*   The **free margin** of the tag points towards the **origin** (start) of the force.
*   The **attached/heaped-up** end points towards the **direction** (end) of the force.

### Ageing of Abrasions
The healing process of an abrasion is used to estimate the time since injury. The formation and colour changes of the **[[scab]]** (crust) are the primary indicators.

**Mnemonic for Ageing:** **"R^2 B^3"** (Red, Red-Brown, Brown, Black, Bye-bye)

| Time Since Injury | Appearance/Stage | Pathological Change |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fresh (< 12 hours)** | Bright Red, Oozing | Exudation of blood, lymph, and tissue fluid. Moist surface. |
| **12 – 24 Hours** | **Reddish** Scab | Blood and lymph dry up to form a soft crust. Polymorphonuclear infiltration begins. |
| **2 – 3 Days** | **Reddish-Brown** Scab | Scab becomes distinct, dry, and harder. |
| **4 – 7 Days** | **Dark Brown / Blackish** Scab | Scab becomes firm and brownish-black. Epithelium grows from edges (regeneration). |
| **After 7 Days** | Scab Falls Off (**Bye-bye**) | Scab separates leaving a hypopigmented (pinkish/whitish) tender area. |

> **Note:** The healing time varies depending on the size, depth, infection, and general health of the individual.

### Antemortem vs Postmortem Abrasions

| Feature | [[Antemortem Abrasion]] | [[Postmortem Abrasion]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Site** | Anywhere on the body. | Usually over bony prominences. |
| **Colour** | Bright red or reddish-brown. | Yellowish, translucent, parchment-like. |
| **Exudation** | Serum/lymph oozes and forms a scab. | No exudation; surface is dry. |
| **Vital Reaction** | Present (Hyperaemia, infiltration). | Absent. |
| **Microscopy** | Congestion and cellular infiltration. | No congestion or infiltration. |
| **Enzyme Study** | Increased enzyme activity (e.g., histamine, serotonin). | No increase in enzyme activity. |

---

### Differential Diagnosis (Artifacts)
*   **Ant bites:** Irregular margins, often clustered at moist areas (eyes, nose, mouth, genitals), postmortem nature (yellow/dry), no vital reaction.
*   **Excoriations:** Due to scratching (e.g., skin diseases).
*   **[[Postmortem artifacts]]:** Drying of lips or scrotum may mimic abrasions.
*   **Diaper rash:** In infants/elderly, due to ammonia in urine.

### Medicolegal Importance
1.  **Site of Impact:** Pinpoints the exact location where force was applied.
2.  **Direction of Force:** Determined by epithelial tags.
3.  **Identification of Object:** **[[Patterned abrasions]]** (e.g., tyre treads, radiator grills, rope texture, teeth marks) can link a specific weapon or vehicle to the injury.
4.  **Cause of Injury:** Fingernail abrasions (crescentic) on the neck suggest **[[throttling]]**; on thighs/genitals suggest **[[sexual assault]]**.
5.  **Age of Injury:** Helps in reconstructing the timeline of the crime.
6.  **Character of Offence:** Suggests struggle (defence wounds) or homicide.

### Autopsy Findings
*   Trace evidence such as grease, paint, sand, or gravel embedded in the abrasion must be collected to link the victim to the crime scene (e.g., road accident).
*   Patterned injuries must be photographed with a scale.
*   Incise the abrasion to look for underlying bruising (contusion) to confirm it is antemortem.
