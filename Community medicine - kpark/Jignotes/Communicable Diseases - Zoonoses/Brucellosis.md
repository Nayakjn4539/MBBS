# Brucellosis (Undulant Fever / Malta Fever / Mediterranean Fever)

Brucellosis is a major [[Zoonosis]] (disease transmitted from animals to humans) caused by the genus *Brucella*. It is characterized by intermittent or irregular febrile attacks, profuse sweating, arthritis, and an enlarged spleen. It is primarily an occupational disease.

### 1. Agent Factors
*   **Agent:** Small, gram-negative, non-motile, non-sporing, intracellular coccobacilli.
*   **Species infecting man:**
    *   *[[Brucella melitensis]]*: Infects **goats and sheep**. It is the **most virulent** and invasive species.
    *   *Brucella abortus*: Primarily infects **cattle**. Less virulent.
    *   *Brucella suis*: Infects **pigs** (swine). Intermediate virulence.
    *   *Brucella canis*: Parasite of **dogs**.
*   **Viability:** The organism can survive for weeks or months in water, urine, feces, damp soil, and manure.

### 2. Reservoir of Infection
*   **Natural Host:** Cattle, sheep, goats, swine, buffaloes, horses, and dogs.
*   **Animal Pathology:** In animals, the disease causes abortion, premature expulsion of the fetus, or death.
*   **Excretion:** Infected animals excrete *Brucella* in urine, milk, placenta, uterine, and vaginal discharges.
*   **Chronicity:** Animals may remain infected for life.

### 3. Modes of Transmission
There is **no evidence** of transmission from man to man.
*   **Contact Infection (Most Common):** Direct contact with infected tissues, blood, urine, vaginal discharge, aborted fetuses, and especially the **placenta**.
    *   *Entry:* Through abraded skin, mucosa, or conjunctiva.
    *   *Risk Groups:* Veterinarians, butchers, shepherds, slaughterhouse workers.
*   **Food-borne Infection:** Ingestion of raw [[Pasteurization|unpasteurized milk]] or dairy products (like cheese) from infected animals. Also via raw vegetables grown on soil containing infected manure.
*   **Air-borne Infection:** Inhalation of infected dust or aerosols in cowsheds, slaughterhouses, and laboratories.

### 4. Incubation Period
*   Highly variable.
*   **Usually 1–3 weeks**, but can range from 5 days to 6 months or more.

### 5. Clinical Picture
The disease can vary from acute febrile illness to a chronic low-grade disease.
*   **Onset:** Sudden or insidious.
*   **Classic Triad:**
    1.  **Fever:** Intermittent, irregular, or "undulant" (wave-like) pyrexia (up to 40–41°C).
    2.  **Sweating:** Profuse, especially at night or early morning.
    3.  **Arthralgia/Arthritis:** Usually monoarticular involving large joints (hip, knee, shoulder).
*   **Other Symptoms:** Low back pain, headache, insomnia, anorexia.
*   **Signs:** Palpable [[Splenomegaly]], hepatomegaly, and lymphadenopathy.
*   **Key Clinical Feature:** The severity of the illness often contrasts with the **absence of specific clinical signs**.

### 6. Diagnosis
*   **Hemogram:** Normal or reduced WBC count with relative **lymphocytosis**.
*   **Culture (Gold Standard):** Isolation of organism from blood, bone marrow, or biopsy specimens. Blood culture should be kept for 6 weeks before being labeled negative.
*   **Serology:**
    *   **Standard Agglutination Test (SAT):** Most practical screening method. A titer of **1:100 or higher**, or a rising titer in paired sera, indicates infection.
    *   *Note:* Cross-reactions can occur with *Vibrio cholerae*.
    *   ELISA: Useful for IgM and IgG detection.
*   **Skin Test (Brucellin):** Limited utility; positive test may only indicate past exposure (like Mantoux in TB).

### 7. Treatment
*   **Drug of Choice:** [[Tetracycline]] (or Doxycycline).
*   **Regimen:** Treatment must be prolonged to prevent relapse (since the organism is intracellular).
*   **Standard Therapy:** Tetracycline is often combined with Streptomycin or Rifampicin.
*   **Duration:** Usually 2–3 weeks for acute phase, but chronic cases may require treatment for weeks/months. Permanent remission of fever usually occurs within 3–6 months.

### 8. Prevention and Control
**A. Control in Animals (The most rational approach):**
*   **Test and Slaughter:** Identify infected animals via mass surveys (skin test/serology) and slaughter them with compensation to farmers. Aimed at eradication.
*   **Vaccination:**
    *   *B. abortus* strain 19 vaccine for cattle.
    *   *Rev-1* vaccine for goats and sheep.
*   **Hygiene:** Proper disposal of placenta, urine, and feces; sanitary cattle sheds.

**B. Prevention in Humans:**
*   **[[Pasteurization]]** of milk (Boiling milk is essential in endemic areas).
*   **Personal Hygiene:** Use of protective clothing/gloves by high-risk workers (vets, abattoir workers) when handling animal tissues.
*   **Health Education:** Regarding risks of raw dairy and handling animals.

### 💡 Mnemonics
**To remember the Species and their Hosts:**
*   **M**elitensis = **M**utton (Sheep/Goat) - **M**ost Virulent.
*   **A**bortus = **A**nimals (Cattle/Cows).
*   **S**uis = **S**wine (Pigs).
*   **C**anis = **C**anine (Dogs).

**Clinical Features:**
**"UNDULANT"**
*   **U**ndulant fever (Rise and fall like a wave)
*   **N**ight sweats
*   **D**epression/Malaise
*   **U**rinary symptoms (rare but possible)
*   **L**ymphadenopathy/Liver enlargement
*   **A**rthralgia (Joint pain - Hip/Knee)
*   **N**o person-to-person transmission
*   **T**etracycline is the drug of choice
