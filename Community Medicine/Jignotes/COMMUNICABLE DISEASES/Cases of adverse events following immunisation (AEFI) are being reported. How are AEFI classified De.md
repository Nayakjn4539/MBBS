# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Cases of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) are being reported. How are AEFI classified? Describe important health managerial functions needed to address and overcome the problems.

### **Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI)**

An [[AEFI]] is defined as any untoward medical occurrence which follows immunization and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine., The adverse event may be any unfavorable or unintended sign, abnormal laboratory finding, symptom, or disease.

### **1. Classification of AEFI**

According to the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) and WHO (2012), AEFIs are grouped into five **cause-specific categorizations**:,

| Category | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. [[Vaccine product-related reaction]]** | An AEFI that is caused or precipitated by a vaccine due to one or more of the inherent properties of the vaccine product., | Extensive limb swelling following [[DTP vaccination]]; Fever after measles vaccine., |
| **2. [[Vaccine quality defect-related reaction]]** | An AEFI caused by a defect in the vaccine product (or its administration device) resulting from the manufacturing process., | Failure to completely inactivate a lot of [[Inactivated Polio Vaccine]] (IPV) leading to paralytic polio. |
| **3. [[Immunization error-related reaction]]** | An AEFI caused by inappropriate vaccine handling, prescribing, or administration. These are **preventable**., | Transmission of infection by a non-sterile injection; Abscess due to wrong technique., |
| **4. [[Immunization anxiety-related reaction]]** | An AEFI arising from anxiety about the immunization (not the vaccine content)., | [[Vasovagal syncope]] (fainting) in an adolescent during or following vaccination., |
| **5. [[Coincidental event]]** | An AEFI caused by something *other* than the vaccine product, error, or anxiety. It is a chance temporal association., | A fever occurring at the time of vaccination but actually caused by malaria or another underlying illness. |

> **Mnemonic for Classification:** **P-Q-E-A-C**
> *   **P**roduct related
> *   **Q**uality defect
> *   **E**rror (Programmatic)
> *   **A**nxiety related
> *   **C**oincidental
> *(Think: **P**eaceful **Q**ueens **E**at **A**pples **C**almly)*

**Clinical Relevance:**
It is vital to distinguish **Fainting** (Anxiety) from **Anaphylaxis** (Product reaction). Fainting presents with generalized pallor, cold clammy skin, and bradycardia, whereas [[Anaphylaxis]] presents with flushing, urticaria, wheezing, and tachycardia.

### **2. Health Managerial Functions to Address AEFI**

To overcome problems associated with AEFI and maintain public trust in the [[Universal Immunization Programme]], the following managerial functions are essential:

#### **A. Prevention (Quality Assurance)**
*   **Sterilization & Injection Safety:** Ensure proper sterilization of syringes and needles or use Auto-Disable (AD) syringes to reduce infection risk.,
*   **Reconstitution Rules:** [[Measles]] and [[BCG]] vaccines must be reconstituted *only* with the manufacturer-supplied diluent. Discard reconstituted vaccines at the end of the session or within 4 hours (whichever is earlier).
*   **Storage:** Do not store other drugs or substances in the ILR (Ice Lined Refrigerator) to prevent confusion and errors.
*   **Training:** Regular training and close supervision of health workers to ensure proper procedures.

#### **B. Detection and Reporting**
*   **Notification:** All AEFIs must be detected, noted, and notified.
*   **Reportable Events:** Serious events (death, hospitalization, disability), clusters of events, and events causing significant parental concern must be reported immediately.
*   **Minor Reactions:** Common minor reactions (mild fever, local pain) do not strictly need detailed reporting unless they occur in clusters.

#### **C. Investigation of AEFI**
An epidemiological investigation is required to pinpoint the cause and correct practices.

**Steps in AEFI Investigation:**,
1.  **Confirm:** Verify the diagnosis and information in the report. Identify other potential cases.
2.  **Investigate & Collect Data:**
    *   **About Patient:** Immunization history, previous medical history, family history.
    *   **About Event:** Clinical description, timing, treatment outcomes.
    *   **About Vaccine:** Shipping conditions, [[Vaccine Vial Monitor]] (VVM) status, cold chain records, lot numbers.
    *   **About Others:** Did others receiving the same vaccine develop illness?
3.  **Assess the Service:**
    *   Check storage (open vials, diluents).
    *   Observe procedures (reconstitution, injection technique, needle safety).
    *   Check for contamination in open vials.
4.  **Formulate Hypothesis:** Determine the likely cause (Program error vs. Vaccine reaction vs. Coincidental).
5.  **Test Hypothesis:** Match case distribution with the hypothesis. Laboratory testing of the vaccine/diluent is done *only* if there is clear suspicion, not routinely.
6.  **Conclude:** Complete the investigation form, take corrective action, and recommend further steps.

#### **D. Cluster Investigation**
A [[cluster]] is defined as two or more cases of the same adverse event related in time, place, or vaccine.
*   If the event occurs in **unimmunized** people as well $\rightarrow$ Likely **Coincidental**.
*   If cases received the **same vaccine lot** and no similar cases in the community $\rightarrow$ Likely **Vaccine Problem**.
*   If the event is a known reaction but the **rate is increased** (e.g., increased abscesses) $\rightarrow$ Likely **Program Error** (e.g., non-sterile technique).,

#### **E. Crisis Management and Communication**
*   **Treatment:** Immediate medical care for the affected child (e.g., Adrenaline for anaphylaxis).
*   **Communication:** Maintain confidence in the program. Communicate honestly with parents and the community about the investigation results.
*   **Corrective Action:** If a program error is found (e.g., wrong diluent), immediate retraining and logistic correction are required.
