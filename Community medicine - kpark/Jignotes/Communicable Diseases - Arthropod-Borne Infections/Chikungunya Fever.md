# [[Communicable Diseases - Arthropod-Borne Infections]] > Chikungunya Fever

# Chikungunya Fever

**Chikungunya fever** is a debilitating, generally non-fatal viral illness caused by the [[Chikungunya virus]]. The name is derived from a local word (Makonde language) meaning "doubling up," referring to the excruciating joint pain and posture of the patient.

### 1. Epidemiological Determinants

*   **Agent Factor:**
    *   **Agent:** [[Chikungunya virus]].
    *   **Classification:** Group A Arbovirus.
    *   **Genus:** *Alphavirus*.
    *   **Family:** *Togaviridae*.
    *   **Nature:** Single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus.
*   **Vectors:**
    *   **Primary Vectors:** [[Aedes aegypti]] and [[Aedes albopictus]].
    *   Other vectors implicated: *Culex* and *Mansonia* species (rare).
*   **Reservoir of Infection:**
    *   **Wild Cycle:** Monkeys/Primates (Jungle cycle).
    *   **Urban Cycle:** Humans (during epidemics).
    *   **Animals:** Rodents, birds, and other mammals may act as minor reservoirs.

### 2. Transmission Dynamics

*   **Mode of Transmission:**
    *   **Vector-borne:** Bite of an infective female *Aedes* mosquito (mostly daytime biters).
    *   **Vertical Transmission:** Mother to child (rare, during birth).
    *   **Blood-borne:** Theoretical risk via blood transfusion.
*   **Risk of Human-to-Human Transmission:** No direct person-to-person transmission occurs via casual contact, respiratory droplets, or touch.
*   **Seasonal Trend:** Coincides with the rainy season and high mosquito density.

### 3. Incubation Period
*   **Range:** 3–12 days.
*   **Commonly:** [[4–7 days]].

### 4. Clinical Picture
The onset is usually sudden/acute. The disease is characterized by the **Triad of Fever, Rash, and Arthralgia**.

*   **Fever:** High grade, sudden onset, with chills and rigors. Lasts 3–5 days.
*   **Arthralgia (Joint Pain):**
    *   This is the **hallmark feature**.
    *   **Nature:** Severe, excruciating, incapacitating.
    *   **Distribution:** Polyarticular, migratory, affecting small joints (wrists, ankles, phalanges) and large joints (knees, shoulders).
    *   **Duration:** Can persist for weeks, months, or even years (Chronic phase).
*   **Cutaneous Manifestations:**
    *   **Rash:** Morbilliform (measles-like) or maculopapular rash on trunk and limbs (appears 3rd–5th day).
    *   Occasionally petechiae or purpura.
    *   Nasal blotchy erythema.
*   **Other Symptoms:** Headache, conjunctivitis, photophobia, coffee-colored vomiting, lymphadenopathy.

### 5. Diagnosis

*   **Viral Isolation:** From blood (intracerebral inoculation in mice or VERO cells).
*   **RT-PCR:** To detect viral RNA (Best in the first 5 days of fever).
*   **Serology (ELISA):** To detect **[[IgM antibodies]]**.
    *   IgM appears after the 5th day of illness and persists for weeks.
    *   Demonstration of a four-fold rise in antibody titre in paired sera.

### 6. Treatment
There is **no specific antiviral drug** for Chikungunya. Management is purely symptomatic.

*   **Analgesics/Antipyretics:** Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) for fever and pain.
*   **NSAIDs:** Diclofenac or Naproxen for severe joint pain.
*   **Fluids:** Adequate hydration.
*   **Chloroquine:** Sometimes used for refractory chronic arthritis (anti-inflammatory action).
*   **Avoid:** **[[Aspirin]]** (to prevent Reye's syndrome and bleeding risk) and **Steroids** (in the acute phase).

### 7. Prevention and Control

**A. Vector Control (Integrated Vector Management):**
*   **Anti-larval measures:** Source reduction (eliminating breeding sites like coolers, tires, coconut shells), chemical larvicides (Temephos), biological control (Gambusia fish).
*   **Anti-adult measures:** Fogging (Pyrethrum) during outbreaks to kill adult mosquitoes.

**B. Personal Protection:**
*   Use of mosquito nets (LLINs) and screens.
*   Wearing long-sleeved clothing.
*   Use of repellents (DEET).

**C. Vaccination (Recent Advance):**
*   Recently, the **[[IXCHIQ vaccine]]** (Live attenuated) has been FDA approved.
    *   **Dose:** 0.5 ml IM (Single dose).
    *   **Indication:** Adults $\ge$ 18 years at high risk.
    *   **Contraindication:** Pregnancy, lactation, immunocompromised.

### Clinical Relevance: Dengue vs. Chikungunya
*Both share the same vector (Aedes), but clinical presentation differs:*
| Feature | **Dengue** | **Chikungunya** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Joint Pain** | Moderate (Break-bone) | **Severe (Crippling)** |
| **Duration of Pain** | Short (days) | **Long (Months/Years)** |
| **Thrombocytopenia**| Common/Severe | Rare/Mild |
| **Hemorrhage/Shock**| Possible (DHF/DSS) | Rare |
| **Mortality** | Present (if untreated) | **Negligible** |

### Mnemonic for Symptoms
**"CHIK"**
*   **C** - **C**rippling joint pain (Arthritis).
*   **H** - **H**igh Fever.
*   **I** - **I**ncubation period 3-7 days.
*   **K** - **K**ills rarely (Low mortality).
