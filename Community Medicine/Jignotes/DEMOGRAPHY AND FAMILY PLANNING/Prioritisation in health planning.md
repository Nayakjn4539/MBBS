# [[DEMOGRAPHY AND FAMILY PLANNING]] > Prioritisation in health planning

### Prioritisation in Health Planning

**Definition**
Prioritisation is the systematic process of ranking health problems and needs in order of importance or urgency. It involves selecting **outstanding needs** to be met immediately while postponing others until resources are available. It is a critical step (usually Step 4) in the [[Health Planning Cycle]].

**Why is Prioritisation Necessary?**
*   **Scarcity of Resources:** No nation has unlimited money, manpower, or material. Resources always fall short of the total requirement.
*   **Competing Demands:** There are always multiple health problems (e.g., Malaria, TB, Population explosion) competing for the same budget.
*   **Efficiency:** To achieve the maximum benefit (Output) with minimum investment (Input).

### Criteria for Fixing Priorities
When deciding which health problem to tackle first, planners consider the following parameters:

1.  **Magnitude of the Problem:**
    *   Based on [[Morbidity and Mortality indicators]].
    *   Diseases affecting a large portion of the population (High Prevalence) are given priority.
2.  **Severity and Consequences:**
    *   Diseases causing high case fatality or severe disability (e.g., DALYs lost).
3.  **Vulnerability (Social Investment):**
    *   Priority is often given to saving the lives of **younger people** and children in whom there has been considerable social investment.
4.  **Feasibility and Treatability:**
    *   Can the problem be solved with existing technology?
    *   Diseases that can be **prevented at low cost** are prioritized over those requiring expensive, complex cures.
5.  **Community and Political Concern:**
    *   **Felt Needs:** Problems that the community perceives as urgent.
    *   Political pressure and community interests play a significant role in decision-making.
6.  **Financial Constraints:**
    *   Allocation is based on available funds.

**Mnemonic to remember Criteria: "PRIOR"**
*   **P** - **P**olitical and Community concern
*   **R** - **R**esources (Financial constraints)
*   **I** - **I**mpact (Magnitude/Severity of disease)
*   **O** - **O**perational feasibility (Treatability)
*   **R** - **R**isk groups (Vulnerability/Young lives)

### Methods and Techniques for Prioritisation

Planners use management techniques to validate their priorities:

| Technique | Description | Key Indicator |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Cost-Benefit Analysis]] (CBA)** | Compares the cost of a program to the economic benefits (monetary terms) gained. | Benefit-to-Cost Ratio |
| **[[Cost-Effectiveness Analysis]] (CEA)** | Compares cost to health outcomes (natural units like lives saved, not money). Better for health sector. | **[[QALY]]** (Quality Adjusted Life Years) |
| **Risk Approach** | Identifying "High Risk" groups and directing resources to them first. | "Something for all, but more for those in need" |

### Prioritisation in Context of Demography and Family Planning

In the context of population control and family welfare, prioritisation is applied as follows:

**1. Geographic Prioritisation (High Focus States)**
*   Resources are not distributed evenly; they are focused where the demographic lag is highest.
*   **Empowered Action Group (EAG) States:** States like Bihar, UP, MP, and Rajasthan have high fertility rates. They receive priority funding and infrastructure support under missions like [[National Health Mission]].

**2. Target Group Prioritisation (Risk Approach)**
*   **Eligible Couples:** Focusing on couples in the reproductive age group (15-49 years).
*   **High-Risk Pregnancies:** Elderly primi, short statured primi, anaemic mothers, etc., are prioritized for skilled care to reduce [[Maternal Mortality Rate]].
*   **Adolescents:** Focus on RKSK (Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram) to delay age of marriage and first pregnancy.

**3. Service Prioritisation**
*   Shift from "Target-based approach" to **[[Community Needs Assessment Approach]] (CNAA)**.
*   Focus on **Spacing methods** (temporary contraception) for younger couples vs **Terminal methods** (sterilization) for couples with completed families.

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Triage in Disaster:** This is the most acute form of prioritisation where patients are categorized (Red, Yellow, Green, Black) based on urgency and survival chance to allocate immediate medical care.
*   **Screening:** Prioritisation dictates that we screen for diseases that are an "Important health problem" with a recognizable latent stage and available treatment (Wilson and Jungner criteria).
