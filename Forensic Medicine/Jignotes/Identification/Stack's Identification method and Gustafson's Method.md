# [[Identification]] > Stack's Identification method and Gustafson's Method

### **Gustafson's Method**

This is the most famous and widely accepted method for **[[Age Estimation]]** in adults (specifically those above 21–25 years of age) using teeth. It is based on physiological and degenerative changes that occur in the dental tissues with advancing age.

#### **Principle**
*   **Target Group:** Adults (over 21 years).
*   **Sample:** Requires a **longitudinal ground section** of the tooth (preferably a central incisor) of about 1 mm thickness.
*   **Mechanism:** It evaluates six retrogressive changes in the tooth.

#### **The Six Criteria (Factors)**
Gustafson identified six changes and formulated a scoring system.
*(Mnemonic: **A**ll **P**eople **S**eem **C**onfused **R**egarding **T**eeth)*

| Criteria | Pathology/Change | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A** - **Attrition** | Wearing down of the incisal or occlusal surface. | Mechanical wear due to mastication over years. |
| **P** - **Periodontosis** | Gum recession and loosening of teeth. | Downward retraction of gingiva and degeneration of periodontal membrane. |
| **S** - **Secondary Dentin** | Formation of new dentin inside the pulp cavity. | Protective mechanism reducing the size of the pulp cavity with age. |
| **C** - **Cementum Apposition** | Thickening of cementum at the root. | Continuous deposition of cementum layers throughout life to anchor the tooth. |
| **R** - **Root Resorption** | Eating away of the root surface. | Pathological/Physiological resorption of the root apex. |
| **T** - **Transparency of Root** | Root dentin becomes transparent. | **Most reliable criteria.** Minerals deposit in dentinal tubules (sclerosis), making them invisible (transparent) starting from the apex upwards. |

#### **Scoring and Formula**
Each of the 6 factors is awarded a score from **0 to 3** based on intensity:
*   **0:** No change (Normal).
*   **1:** Initial phase/slight change.
*   **2:** Moderate change.
*   **3:** Severe/Advanced change.

**Total Score (X) = A + P + S + C + R + T**

**Formula for Age Calculation:**
$$ \text{Age} = 11.43 + (4.56 \times X) $$
*(Note: Some texts use slightly varying regression formulas, but the concept remains the calculation of estimated age based on the total score)*.

#### **Medicolegal Importance**
*   **Error Margin:** There is a standard error of estimate of approximately **± 3.6 to 5 years**.
*   **Reliability:** The **Transparency of Root** is considered the single most reliable indicator among the six for age estimation.
*   **Limitation:** It requires extraction of the tooth (invasive) and microscopic preparation.

### **Stack's Method**

This method is distinct from Gustafson's as it is used for the **[[Fetus]]** and **Infants**, not adults. It relies on the physical measurements of developing teeth.

#### **Principle**
*   **Target Group:** Fetuses and Infants (up to ~7 months of postnatal age).
*   **Basis:** The growth of teeth in the pre-eruptive phase is proportional to the age of the fetus/infant.
*   **Method:** It involves measuring the **weight** and **height** of the developing tooth germs (follicles) or the mineralized tooth cusps.

#### **Procedure**
1.  **Isolation:** The developing tooth buds (usually anterior teeth/incisors) are dissected out of the jaw.
2.  **Cleaning:** Soft tissues are removed.
3.  **Measurement:**
    *   **Dry Weight:** The mineralized part of the tooth is weighed.
    *   **Height:** The vertical dimension is measured.

#### **Medicolegal Significance**
*   **Infanticide Cases:** Useful in establishing the age of the fetus or newborn found dead, helping to distinguish between a viable fetus and a non-viable abortus.
*   **[[Live Birth]] vs Dead Birth:** The presence of a **Neonatal Line** (seen microscopically) in the enamel indicates that the child survived birth trauma and lived for at least a few days. While Stack's primarily uses measurements, it is often discussed alongside histological findings like the neonatal line in infant identification.

### **Comparison Summary**

| Feature | **Gustafson's Method** | **Stack's Method** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Target Age** | Adults (> 21-25 years) | Fetuses and Infants |
| **Basis** | Retrogressive/Degenerative changes | Progressive growth (Height/Weight) |
| **Tooth State** | Erupted, worn teeth | Unerupted tooth germs/buds |
| **Technique** | Ground Section (Microscopy) | Gravimetric (Weight) & Morphometric (Height) |
| **Key Use** | Identification of unknown adult remains | Investigation of [[Infanticide]]/Fetal Age |
