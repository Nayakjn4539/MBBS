### Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC)

[[Kangaroo Mother Care]] is a low-cost, effective, and evidence-based method of care for **Low Birth Weight (LBW)** infants, primarily involving continuous skin-to-skin contact. It was first introduced in **Colombia in 1979** by Drs. Hector Martinez and Edgar Rey as a response to overcrowding and high infection rates in hospitals.

It is an essential element in the continuum of neonatal care and a vital component of the [[Warm Chain]] to prevent [[Hypothermia]].

### **Components of KMC**

There are **three** (sometimes cited as four) main components of KMC:

1.  **Skin-to-Skin Contact (The Position):** Early, continuous, and prolonged contact between the mother's breasts.
2.  **Exclusive Breastfeeding (The Nutrition):** Promotes lactation and facilitates feeding.
3.  **Early Discharge:** Allows for ambulatory care and follow-up.
4.  **Support:** Physical and emotional support for the mother/family.

**Mnemonic to remember Components:** **SANE**
*   **S** - **S**kin to skin contact
*   **A** - **A**mbulatory support
*   **N** - **N**utritional support (Exclusive Breastfeeding)
*   **E** - **E**motional bonding

### **Prerequisites for KMC**

| **For the Baby** | **For the Mother** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Hemodynamically stable** | Willing and motivated |
| Weight **< 2000 gm** (Usually started when stable) | Free from serious illness |
| Breathing spontaneously (no severe respiratory distress) | Maintains hygiene |
| No major illness/sepsis | Family support available |

> **Note:** KMC can also be provided by the **father** or other family members when the mother is resting.

### **The KMC Procedure**

**1. Kangaroo Position:**
*   **Placement:** The baby is placed between the mother's breasts in an upright position.
*   **Skin Contact:** Direct skin-to-skin contact.
*   **Posture:** The infant's hips should be flexed and abducted in a **"frog-like"** position.
*   **Head:** Turned to one side to keep the [[Airway]] clear and allow eye contact.
*   **Clothing:** Baby wears only a nappy, cap, and socks. The mother covers the baby with her clothes/shawl.

**2. Kangaroo Nutrition:**
*   Promotes **Exclusive Breastfeeding**.
*   The baby is close to the nipple, stimulating milk production via the let-down reflex.
*   If the baby is too weak to suckle, expressed breast milk can be given via spoon/tube/cup.

### **Benefits of KMC**

KMC acts as a **"Natural Incubator"**.

| **Beneficiary** | **Advantages** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **The Baby** | • **Thermal Control:** Prevents [[Hypothermia]] effectively.<br>• **Infection Control:** Reduces nosocomial infections.<br>• **Physiological Stability:** Stable Heart Rate and Respiratory Rate.<br>• **Growth:** Better weight gain.<br>• **Development:** Improved cognitive development and higher IQ.<br>• **Safety:** Reduced Apnea spells. |
| **The Mother** | • **Bonding:** Improves emotional bonding (Oxytocin release).<br>• **Lactation:** Increased milk volume.<br>• **Psychological:** Increased confidence and satisfaction; reduced anxiety.<br>• **Involvement:** Active role in the care of her baby. |
| **The Hospital/Nation** | • **Cost-Effective:** Saves manpower, electricity, and incubator costs.<br>• **Mortality:** Reduces [[Neonatal Mortality Rate]] (NMR) and [[Infant Mortality Rate]] (IMR). |

### **Duration and Discharge**

*   **Duration:**
    *   Should be started as soon as the baby is stable.
    *   **Minimum duration:** At least **1 hour per session** (to avoid stress of frequent handling). Ideally provided for **24 hours/day** (continuous) or as long as possible.
    *   **When to stop:** Usually continued until the baby reaches **2500g** or starts wriggling out (indicating they can thermoregulate themselves).

*   **Discharge Criteria:**
    *   Baby gaining weight (**> 15-20g/kg/day** or roughly **40g/day** for 5 consecutive days).
    *   Maintains body temperature without a heater.
    *   Feeding well on breast milk.
    *   Mother is confident in handling the baby.
