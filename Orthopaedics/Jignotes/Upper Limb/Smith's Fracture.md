# [[Upper Limb]] > Smith's Fracture

# Smith's Fracture (Reverse Colles')

### Definition and Overview
**Smith's Fracture**, also widely known as a **Reverse Colles' Fracture**, is a fracture of the distal end of the [[Radius]] (usually within 2.5 cm or 1 inch of the articular surface) characterized by **volar (palmar) displacement** and volar angulation of the distal fragment,,.

*   **Historical Note:** It was first described by **Robert William Smith** (an Irish surgeon) in 1847.
*   **Incidence:** It is less common than [[Colles' Fracture]]. It is seen in young adults due to high-energy trauma and in the elderly due to osteoporotic bones.

### Mechanism of Injury
The mechanism is distinctly different from Colles' fracture. It typically occurs due to:
1.  **Fall on the Flexed Wrist:** A fall onto the dorsum (back) of the hand with the wrist flexed,.
2.  **Direct Blow:** A direct blow to the dorsum of the wrist and hand.

### Clinical Features
The clinical presentation is distinct due to the direction of displacement.
*   **Pain and Swelling:** Localized to the wrist.
*   **Tenderness:** Present over the distal radius.
*   **Deformity:** The classical deformity is the **"Garden Spade Deformity"**,.
    *   There is a fullness on the volar (palmar) aspect of the wrist due to the displaced distal fragment.
    *   The dorsal aspect of the distal radius becomes prominent.
    *   This is the reverse of the "Dinner Fork deformity" seen in Colles' fracture.

### Radiological Features
Diagnostic imaging involves X-rays of the wrist (AP and Lateral views).
*   **Fracture Line:** Transverse fracture of the distal radius.
*   **Displacement:** The distal fragment is displaced **ventrally (volarly/anteriorly)** and tilted ventrally,.
*   **Comminution:** There is often comminution of the palmar cortex.

### Differential Diagnosis
It is crucial to differentiate Smith's fracture from other distal radial injuries.

**Table 1: Distal Radius Fracture Differentials**

| Feature | [[Colles' Fracture]] | **Smith's Fracture** | [[Volar Barton's Fracture]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Distal Fragment** | Dorsal displacement | **Volar displacement** | Volar displacement |
| **Angulation** | Dorsal tilt | **Volar tilt** | Volar tilt |
| **Articular Involvement** | Usually Extra-articular (can be intra) | **Usually Extra-articular** (can be intra) | **Always Intra-articular** fracture-dislocation |
| **Mechanism** | Fall on outstretched hand (Extension) | **Fall on flexed wrist** | Fall on extended/flexed wrist |
| **Deformity** | Dinner Fork | **Garden Spade** | Variable |

### Treatment
Smith's fractures are often unstable and require careful management.

#### 1. Conservative Management
*   **Indication:** Undisplaced fractures or stable fractures in elderly patients where anatomic reduction is not critical.
*   **Technique:** Closed reduction under anesthesia.
*   **Immobilization:** The wrist is immobilized in a long arm or short arm cast. Some sources suggest casting in **extension** (supination) to counteract the deforming forces, usually for 6 weeks.

#### 2. Operative Management
Operative treatment is frequently required because these fractures are inherently unstable and often act as a **"Fracture of Necessity"**.
*   **Indication:**
    *   Failed closed reduction.
    *   Unstable fractures (comminution).
    *   Intra-articular extension.
    *   Young, active patients.
*   **Method:** **Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF)**.
*   **Implant:** A specific **Volar Buttress Plate** (e.g., [[Ellis Buttress Plate]]) is commonly used. This plate is applied to the volar aspect of the radius to prevent the distal fragment from slipping anteriorly.

### Complications
Complications are similar to those of Colles' fracture.
1.  **Malunion:** Resulting in cosmetic deformity and limited wrist extension.
2.  **Stiffness:** Of the wrist and fingers due to prolonged immobilization.
3.  **Median Nerve Compression:** Acute [[Carpal Tunnel Syndrome]] due to anterior displacement of the fragment compressing the tunnel structures.
4.  **Osteoarthritis:** Secondary radiocarpal arthritis if the fracture extends into the joint.
5.  **Tendon Rupture:** Rupture of the extensor pollicis longus is possible but less common than in Colles'.

### Clinical Implications
> **Critical Alert:** Smith's fracture is easily confused with **Volar Barton's fracture**. A Volar Barton's is an intra-articular fracture-subluxation where the carpus moves with the fracture fragment. Smith's is typically extra-articular (or simple intra-articular without subluxation). This distinction dictates surgical approach and urgency.
