# [[Special Injuries]] > Burns

### **Definitions**
A [[burn]] is an injury caused by the application of heat, chemical substances, electricity, or radiation to the external or internal surfaces of the body, causing tissue destruction.
*   **Scald:** Injury produced by moist heat (liquid above 60°C or steam).
*   **Corrosive burn:** Injury produced by chemicals (acids/alkalis).

---

### **Classification of Burns**

#### **1. Based on Etiology**
*   **Thermal Burns:** Caused by dry heat (flame, heated solid) or moist heat (scalds).
*   **Chemical Burns:** Caused by strong acids (sulfuric, nitric) or alkalis.
*   **Electrical Burns:** Caused by passage of electric current ([[Joule burn]]).
*   **Radiation Burns:** X-rays, UV rays, radium.

#### **2. Based on Depth of Injury**
There are two main classification systems used clinically and medicolegally:

**A. Wilson’s Classification (Clinical)**
Used commonly in clinical practice.
1.  **First Degree (Epidermal):** Erythema, redness, pain. No blisters. Heals without scarring.
2.  **Second Degree (Dermo-epidermal):** Vesication with **blister** formation. Extremely painful.
3.  **Third Degree (Deep):** Destruction of whole skin including dermis and nerve endings. Painless (due to nerve destruction). Heals with scarring.

**B. Dupuytren’s Classification**
Used in forensic pathology to describe the severity of tissue destruction.
*   **1st Degree:** Erythema (Redness).
*   **2nd Degree:** Vesication (Blisters).
*   **3rd Degree:** Destruction of superficial dermis.
*   **4th Degree:** Destruction of whole dermis (true skin).
*   **5th Degree:** Destruction of muscles.
*   **6th Degree:** Charring involving bones.

### **Estimation of Burn Surface Area (TBSA)**

The extent of the burn is a critical factor in prognosis.

#### **1. Wallace’s Rule of Nines**
Applicable for **adults**. The body is divided into areas representing 9% or multiples of 9%.

| Body Region | Percentage (Adults) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Head and Neck** | 9% |
| **Each Upper Limb** | 9% (Total 18%) |
| **Front of Trunk** (Chest + Abdomen) | 18% |
| **Back of Trunk** | 18% |
| **Each Lower Limb** | 18% (Total 36%) |
| **Perineum/Genitalia** | 1% |
| **Total** | **100%** |

#### **2. Rule of Nines for Children**
Children have a relatively larger head and smaller legs compared to adults.
*   **Head:** 18% (decreases with age).
*   **Each Lower Limb:** 13.5% (increases with age).

#### **3. Rule of Palm**
*   The patient’s own **palm** (excluding fingers) represents approximately **1%** of their Total Body Surface Area (TBSA).
*   Useful for estimating irregular or patchy burns.

### **Pathology and Cause of Death**

The cause of death depends on the time elapsed since the burn occurred.

| Time Since Injury | Primary Cause of Death | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Immediate (0-3 hours)** | **Neurogenic Shock** | Severe pain and fright. |
| **Delayed (3-48 hours)** | **Hypovolemic Shock** | Loss of plasma/fluid from burnt surface leading to haemoconcentration. |
| **Late (> 48 hours)** | **Sepsis / Toxemia** | Bacterial infection (Pseudomonas), absorption of toxins from necrotic tissue. |
| **Weeks later** | **Complications** | Acute Renal Failure, [[Curling's ulcer]], ARDS, Pneumonia. |

**Important Note:** If >50% of body surface area is burnt, the result is nearly always fatal.

### **Autopsy Findings**

#### **1. External Findings**
*   **Pugilistic Attitude (Boxer’s Attitude):**
    *   **Appearance:** The body assumes a fencing or boxing posture with flexion of elbows, wrists, hips, and knees.
    *   **Cause:** Coagulation of muscle proteins due to heat. Flexor muscles are bulkier than extensors, so their contraction dominates.
    *   **Significance:** It is a **heat stiffening** artifact. It occurs in **both** antemortem and postmortem burns; it does **not** indicate life or struggle.
*   **Heat Ruptures:**
    *   Splits in the skin caused by contraction of tissues.
    *   Usually seen over extensors/joints.
    *   **Differentiation from Incised Wounds:** Heat ruptures have intact vessels/nerves bridging the gap, irregular margins, and lack vital reaction/bruising.
*   **Degloving:** Skin of hands and feet may peel off like a glove/stocking.
*   **Crocodile Skin:** Charred skin may crack into mosaic patterns resembling crocodile skin (High voltage/severe burns).

#### **2. Internal Findings**
*   **Cherry Red Blood:** Due to inhalation of Carbon Monoxide (CO) forming [[Carboxyhemoglobin]] (COHb). Indicates the person was alive during the fire.
*   **Soot in Airway:** Presence of carbon particles (soot) mixed with mucus in the trachea and bronchi is a sure sign of vitality (inhalation of smoke).
*   **Heat Hematoma:**
    *   Accumulation of blood in the extradural space due to heat-induced rupture of emissary veins/diploic vessels.
    *   **Appearance:** Chocolate brown paste, honeycomb texture, friable.
    *   Must be differentiated from traumatic [[Extradural Hemorrhage]] (which is usually localized, clotted, and associated with fracture lines).
*   **Curling's Ulcer:** Acute stress ulcers in the duodenum seen in delayed deaths.
*   **Cooked Brain:** Brain becomes shrunken, firm, and yellow-brown.

### **Medicolegal Aspects: Antemortem vs Postmortem Burns**

Differentiating whether a person was burnt while alive or after death is the most critical medicolegal question.

| Feature | **Antemortem Burns** (Vitality present) | **Postmortem Burns** (Vitality absent) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Line of Redness** | **Present.** Red hyperemic line between burnt and normal skin. | **Absent.** |
| **Vesicles (Blisters)** | Contain fluid rich in **albumin/protein** and chlorides. Base is red/inflamed. | Contain air or minimal fluid with no protein. Base is dry/yellow. |
| **Infection/Pus** | May be present (if survived long enough). | Absent. |
| **Soot in Respiratory Tract** | **Present** (deep in bronchi). Definitive sign of life. | Absent (or only in mouth/nostrils passively). |
| **Carboxyhemoglobin** | **Present** (>10% saturation). | Absent. |
| **Enzyme Reaction** | Increased enzyme activity at the periphery. | No increase in enzyme activity. |

**Mnemonic for Antemortem Findings:** **FIRE**
*   **F**luid in blisters (High Protein)
*   **I**nflammation (Red Line)
*   **R**epair processes (Granulation tissue)
*   **E**nzymes increased

### **Specific Burn Types**

#### **Scalds**
*   Caused by moist heat (steam, hot liquids).
*   **Features:** Bleaching/soddening of skin, vesicles present. **Singeing of hair and charring are ABSENT**.
*   **Splash burns:** Downward streaks of liquid causing lines of blisters.

#### **Chemical Burns (Corrosives)**
*   **Acids:** Sulfuric acid (black/brown charring), Nitric acid (yellow), Hydrochloric acid (grey/white).
*   **Alkalis:** Cause colliquative necrosis (more penetrating than acids).
*   **Feature:** No blister formation usually.

#### **Joule Burn (Electrical)**
*   Specific endogenous burn at the point of entry of electric current.
*   **Appearance:** Collapsed blister, central crater, pale areola, no inflammation.
*   **Metallization:** Deposition of electrode metal particles in the wound.
