# External Fixation

### Definition and Concept
[[External Fixation]] is a method of fixing fractures or bone segments where the stabilizing structural elements (bars, rods, rings) are located **outside the body**, connected to the bone via transcutaneous pins or wires,,.

**Core Functions:**
*   Provides stability to the bone.
*   Maintains anatomical position and length.
*   Allows access to soft tissues for wound management (crucial in open fractures).
*   Facilitates **distraction histogenesis** (limb lengthening/bone transport).

### Components of an External Fixator
An [[External Fixator]] assembly consists of three basic components:
1.  **Pins:** The interface between the bone and the external frame.
    *   **Schanz Pins (Half-pins):** Threaded tips, used in monolateral fixators.
    *   **Transfixing Pins (Full pins):** Pass through the limb; rarely used now due to muscle tethering.
    *   **K-wires/Olive Wires:** Thin wires (1.5–2 mm) tensioned across rings (used in Ilizarov),.
2.  **Clamps:** Connect pins to rods or rings. Can be simple or modular (clusters).
3.  **External Rods/Rings:** Provide the structural rigidity.
    *   **Rods:** Stainless steel, aluminum, or carbon fiber.
    *   **Rings:** Used in circular fixators (Ilizarov).

### Classification of External Fixators

| Type | Description | Common Indications |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Monolateral (Uniplanar)** | Pins are placed on one side of the limb, connected by a rod/bar. | Simple diaphyseal fractures, transport over rail system. |
| **Biplanar/Delta Frame** | Pins placed in two planes (e.g., 90° to each other) for increased stability. | Unstable fractures requiring rotational control. |
| **Circular (Ring) Fixator** | Uses tensioned wires attached to rings encircling the limb (e.g., [[Ilizarov Fixator]]). | Complex fractures, non-unions, limb lengthening, deformity correction. |
| **Hybrid Fixator** | Combination of rings (usually periarticular) and monolateral pins (diaphyseal). | Periarticular fractures (e.g., proximal tibia). |
| **Spanning Fixator** | Spans across a joint (e.g., Knee or Ankle). | Severe intra-articular trauma, "Damage Control" to rest soft tissues. |

### Indications
The primary indication is when [[Internal Fixation]] (plates/nails) is contraindicated or risky,.

*   **Open Fractures:** Especially Gustilo-Anderson Type IIIB and IIIC (allows wound inspection and plastic surgery coverage),.
*   **Polytrauma (Damage Control Orthopaedics):** Rapid stabilization to stop bleeding and reduce pain in unstable patients (e.g., [[Pelvic Fracture]], [[Femur Fracture]]),.
*   **Infected Fractures/Non-Union:** Avoids placing foreign material (metal) at the infection site,.
*   **Severe Comminution:** Where internal fixation is technically difficult.
*   **Deformity Correction & Limb Lengthening:** Utilizing the principle of distraction osteogenesis,.
*   **Arthrodesis:** Compression arthrodesis of joints (e.g., Knee, Ankle).

### Biomechanics of Stability
To increase the stiffness and stability of a standard tubular external fixator, the following principles apply:
1.  **Pin Diameter:** Stiffness is proportional to the **4th power** of the pin diameter (most important factor).
2.  **Pin Spread (Near-Far Construct):** Placing pins far apart on the same fragment increases stability. Ideally, one pin near the fracture and one far away.
3.  **Rod-Bone Distance:** Bringing the rod **closer** to the skin/bone increases stability.
4.  **Number of Bars:** Adding a second bar (double stacking) increases rigidity.
5.  **Multiplanar:** A biplanar construct is more stable than a uniplanar one.

### The Ilizarov Fixator
This is a specialized ring fixator developed by **Gavriil Ilizarov**.

*   **Principle:** **Law of Tension Stress**. Gradual traction on living tissues creates stress that stimulates the regeneration and active growth of bone and soft tissue,.
*   **Technique:**
    1.  **Corticotomy:** Low-energy osteotomy preserving periosteum and marrow blood supply.
    2.  **Latency Period:** A wait of 5–10 days post-surgery before distraction begins.
    3.  **Distraction Phase:** Bone segments are pulled apart.
        *   **Standard Rate:** **1 mm per day** (usually 0.25 mm every 6 hours).
        *   *Too fast:* Soft tissue injury, nerve stretch, poor bone formation (fibrous union).
        *   *Too slow:* Premature consolidation.
    4.  **Consolidation Phase:** Fixator remains in place until the new bone (regenerate) hardens/corticalizes.
*   **Advantages:** Multiplanar stability, allows early weight-bearing (micromotion enhances healing), corrects deformities in 3 planes simultaneously.

### Complications
1.  **Pin Tract Infection:** The **most common** complication (up to 10-30%).
    *   *Management:* Daily cleaning, oral antibiotics, or pin removal if loose,.
2.  **Neurovascular Injury:** Iatrogenic damage during pin insertion (e.g., [[Radial Nerve]] in humerus, [[Common Peroneal Nerve]] in proximal fibula),.
3.  **Joint Stiffness:** Especially if pins tether muscles (e.g., Quadriceps tethering limits knee flexion),.
4.  **Delayed Union/Non-Union:** Caused by over-distraction (gap too wide) or excessive rigidity (lack of micromotion).
5.  **Compartment Syndrome:** Rare, but can occur.
6.  **Refracture:** Occurs if the fixator is removed before full consolidation.

### Clinical Implications & Pin Care
*   **Pin Care:** Crusts should be removed to prevent blockage of drainage. If discharge is present, clean with saline/hydrogen peroxide. Pins should be released if skin tension (tenting) is observed.
*   **Conversion:** In polytrauma, external fixators are often converted to internal fixation (nails/plates) once the patient is stable and soft tissues heal (usually within 2-3 weeks) to prevent long-term pin tract issues.

### Mnemonics
**Indications for External Fixation: "OPEN"**
*   **O**pen fractures (Grade III B/C)
*   **P**olytrauma / Pelvic fracture
*   **E**radication of infection (Infected Non-union)
*   **N**on-union / Needed for Lengthening
