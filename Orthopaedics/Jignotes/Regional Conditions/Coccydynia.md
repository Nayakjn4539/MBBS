# Coccydynia (Tailbone Pain)

### Definition and Anatomy
**Coccydynia** refers to chronic pain in the region of the [[coccyx]] (tailbone). The [[coccyx]] is the terminal part of the [[vertebral column]], usually formed by the fusion of 3 to 5 rudimentary vertebrae. 

### Etiology and Mechanism of Injury
The condition is often a result of injury to the [[coccyx]], though it can become a chronic pain syndrome.
*   **Trauma:** High-velocity trauma or a direct fall onto the buttocks (e.g., falling in a seated position).
*   **Repetitive Microtrauma:** Prolonged sitting on hard surfaces or travel on uneven roads.
*   **Childbirth:** Can cause injury to the [[sacrococcygeal joint]] or ligaments.

### Clinical Features
The diagnosis is largely clinical based on the patient's history and specific symptoms.

*   **Pain Localization:** Pain is localized to the [[buttocks]] and the tailbone area.
*   **Sitting Intolerance:** The hallmark symptom is the inability to sit comfortably. Patients often struggle to find a comfortable position.
*   **Postural Alteration:** Patients may sit sideways or frequently shift weight to one buttock to relieve pressure on the [[coccyx]].
*   **Travel Difficulty:** Increased pain during traveling due to vibrations and prolonged sitting.
*   **Chronic Nature:** The pain often becomes chronic and persistent.

### Diagnostic Investigations

| Modality | Utility | Clinical Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[X-ray]]** | **Lateral View:** Helps visualize [[fractures]] or angulation of the [[coccyx]]. | Positioning the patient for a clear view can be difficult. |
| **[[MRI]]** | **Diagnostic of Choice:** MRI of the [[sacrococcygeal region]] is a better option than X-ray for visualizing inflammation and soft tissue status. | useful to rule out deep infections or tumors. |

### Management
Treatment is primarily conservative. Surgery is reserved for recalcitrant cases.

#### 1. Conservative Management
The majority of patients respond to non-operative measures.
*   **Pressure Relief:** Use of a soft cushion or an **[[air ring]]** (doughnut cushion) while sitting to offload the [[coccyx]].
*   **Medication:** [[Analgesics]] and [[Anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs) to reduce pain and inflammation.
*   **Heat Therapy:** [[Hot fomentation]] or [[sitz bath]] provides symptomatic relief.
*   **Local Injection:** Infiltration of the painful area with **[[hydrocortisone]]** (local steroid).
*   **Manipulation:** Manipulation of the [[coccyx]] under [[anesthesia]] may be attempted in specific cases.

#### 2. Surgical Management
*   **[[Coccygectomy]]:** This involves the surgical excision of the [[coccyx]].
*   **Indication:** It is indicated only when all conservative methods have failed to provide relief.

### Clinical Implications
**Coccydynia** can be psychologically debilitating due to its chronic nature and interference with daily activities like sitting and traveling. Patients often develop **altered sitting postures** to avoid pain, which may lead to secondary back pain. A high index of suspicion for **[[chordoma]]** or other tumors should be maintained if pain persists despite treatment or if there are neurological signs.

*   **C** - **C**ushion (Air ring/Doughnut)
*   **O** - **O**ral Analgesics (NSAIDs)
*   **C** - **C**orticosteroid Injection (Local)
*   **C** - **C**ompresses (Hot fomentation/Sitz bath)
*   **Y** - **Y**es to Manipulation (under anesthesia)
*   **X** - e**X**cision ([[Coccygectomy]]) if all else fails
