# Snoring

### Definition and Overview
**Snoring** is defined as an undesirable, rough, rattling inspiratory sound produced by the vibration of soft tissues in the [[upper airway]] during sleep. It occurs due to turbulent airflow through a narrowed airway.

*   **Spectrum:** It represents a continuum of [[sleep-disordered breathing]] (SDB).
    *   **Primary Snoring (Simple Snoring):** Snoring without excessive daytime sleepiness or oxygen desaturation. Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is < 5.
    *   **Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome (UARS):** Snoring with increased respiratory effort and arousals (Arousal index >5), but AHI < 5.
    *   **Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA):** Snoring associated with cessation of breathing ([[apnea]]) for >10 seconds, hypoxia, and sleep fragmentation.

### Pathophysiology
The mechanism of snoring involves the physics of airflow and anatomical collapsibility:
1.  **Bernoulli’s Principle:** As air passes through a narrowed segment, velocity increases, creating negative pressure laterally.
2.  **Muscle Relaxation:** During sleep (especially [[REM sleep]]), the muscle tone of the pharynx (e.g., [[genioglossus]]) decreases, leading to airway collapse.
3.  **Vibration:** The turbulent airflow causes vibration of loose structures, primarily the [[soft palate]], [[uvula]], [[tonsillar pillars]], and the base of the [[tongue]].

### Etiology and Risk Factors
Snoring is often multifactorial. The obstruction can be at the level of the nose, nasopharynx, oropharynx, or hypopharynx.

#### 1. Local Anatomical Factors
| Level | Causes |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Nose** | [[Deviated nasal septum]] (DNS), [[Hypertrophied turbinates]], [[Nasal polyps]], Nasal valve collapse, Allergy. |
| **Nasopharynx** | [[Adenoid hypertrophy]] (commonest in children), [[Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma]], [[Nasopharyngeal carcinoma]]. |
| **Oropharynx** | Elongated/edematous [[uvula]], Lax [[soft palate]], [[Tonsillar hypertrophy]] (Kissing tonsils), Webbing of posterior pillars. |
| **Hypopharynx** | [[Macroglossia]] (large tongue), [[Lingual tonsil]] hypertrophy, [[Retrognathia]] (receding chin), Micrognathia, Omega-shaped epiglottis. |

#### 2. General and Systemic Factors
*   **Obesity:** Increased fat deposition in the neck and parapharyngeal space narrows the airway.
*   **Neck Circumference:** Collar size >42 cm (17.5 inches) in males significantly increases risk.
*   **Age:** Prevalence increases with age due to loss of muscle tone.
*   **Gender:** Males > Females (2:1 ratio).
*   **Body Position:** Supine position allows the tongue to fall back due to gravity, worsening obstruction.
*   **Lifestyle:** Alcohol and sedatives act as muscle relaxants, worsening pharyngeal collapse.
*   **Smoking:** Causes mucosal edema and inflammation.
*   **Endocrine:** [[Hypothyroidism]] (macroglossia/myxedema), [[Acromegaly]].

### Clinical Features
**History Taking:**
*   **Snoring characteristics:** Loudness, frequency, and whether it disturbs the partner ("Snoring-spouse syndrome").
*   **Witnessed Apneas:** Ask the partner if the patient stops breathing or gasps/chokes during sleep.
*   **Daytime Symptoms:** Excessive [[daytime sleepiness]] (EDS), morning headaches, fatigue, irritability, poor concentration.
*   **Aggravating Factors:** Alcohol, supine position, weight gain.

**Physical Examination:**
*   **General:** Body Mass Index ([[BMI]]), Neck circumference.
*   **Nose:** Check for DNS, polyps, turbinate hypertrophy.
*   **Oropharynx:**
    *   **Mallampati Grading:** Assess the crowding of the oropharynx.
    *   **Tonsil Grading:** (Brodsky scale).
*   **Muller’s Maneuver:** Flexible endoscopy is performed while the patient inspires vigorously with the nose and mouth closed (reverse Valsalva). This assesses the site and degree of airway collapse.

**Clinical Implication:**
> **Adenoid Facies:** In children, chronic snoring due to adenoids leads to an open mouth, high-arched palate, pinched nostrils, and dull expression.

### Investigations
1.  **Polysomnography (PSG):**
    *   The **gold standard** for diagnosis.
    *   Differentiates simple snoring from OSA.
    *   Measures: EEG, EOG, EMG, ECG, airflow, respiratory effort, and oxygen saturation (SaO2).
    *   Calculates **Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI)**.
2.  **Sleep Nasendoscopy / Drug-Induced Sedation Endoscopy (DISE):**
    *   Visualizes the airway under sedation (propofol/midazolam) to identify the specific site of vibration/collapse dynamically.
3.  **Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS):**
    *   A questionnaire to screen for excessive daytime sleepiness. A score >10 warrants investigation.
4.  **Radiology:**
    *   **X-ray Nasopharynx (Lateral view):** To assess adenoid size in children.
    *   **Cephalometry:** To assess craniofacial skeletal abnormalities (e.g., retrognathia).
    *   **CT/MRI:** To rule out tumors or assess anatomical narrowing.

### Management
Treatment depends on the cause (primary vs. OSA) and severity.

#### 1. Non-Surgical / Conservative Management
*   **Lifestyle Modifications:**
    *   **Weight reduction:** Crucial for obese patients.
    *   **Positional Therapy:** Sewing a tennis ball into the back of the pajama to prevent sleeping supine.
    *   **Avoidance:** Stop alcohol, sedatives, and smoking.
*   **Medical Therapy:**
    *   Nasal decongestants/steroids if rhinitis is the cause.
    *   Treat hypothyroidism if present.
*   **Appliances:**
    *   **Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ([[CPAP]]):** The pneumatic splint prevents airway collapse. Treatment of choice for moderate-severe OSA.
    *   **Mandibular Advancement Devices ([[MAD]]):** Protrudes the mandible and tongue forward, increasing retroglossal space.
    *   **Tongue Retaining Devices:** Keeps the tongue anteriorly.

#### 2. Surgical Management
Surgery is indicated for anatomical obstructions or failure of CPAP.

*   **Nasal Surgery:** [[Septoplasty]], [[FESS]] (for polyps), or turbinate reduction to improve nasal airflow.
*   **Oropharyngeal Surgery:**
    *   **Adenotonsillectomy:** The treatment of choice for children with snoring/OSA.
    *   **Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty ([[UPPP]]):** Resection of tonsils, uvula, and part of the soft palate. Effective for snoring but variable results for OSA.
    *   **Laser-Assisted Uvulopalatoplasty (LAUP):** Outpatient procedure for snoring; creates trenches in the soft palate to stiffen it.
    *   **Radiofrequency Ablation ([[Somnoplasty]]):** Shrinks tissue volume of the soft palate or tongue base.
*   **Tongue Base/Hyoid Surgery:**
    *   Genioglossus advancement.
    *   Hyoid suspension.
*   **Tracheostomy:** Bypasses upper airway obstruction. Reserved for life-threatening, refractory OSA.
