# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Vertical transmission of HIV infection. Various modalities of prevention of vertical transmission under NACP.

### Vertical Transmission of HIV Infection

**Vertical transmission** (also known as Mother-to-Child Transmission or [[MTCT]]) refers to the passage of [[HIV]] from an infected mother to her fetus or infant during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding,.

**Magnitude of Risk:**
*   **Without Intervention:** The risk of transmission is approximately **25–30%** (ranges from 20-45% depending on breastfeeding duration),.
*   **With Intervention:** Effective interventions under the [[NACP]] can reduce this risk to less than **2%**.

#### 1. Stages of Vertical Transmission
Transmission can occur at three specific stages,:

| Stage | Mechanism | Risk Factor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Antepartum** (Pregnancy) | Transplacental passage of the virus. | High viral load, advanced [[AIDS]], placental malaria. |
| **Intrapartum** (Delivery) | Exposure to maternal blood and genital secretions. **(Highest Risk: accounts for up to 2/3 of cases)**. | Prolonged rupture of membranes, invasive procedures (episiotomy), vaginal delivery. |
| **Postpartum** (Breastfeeding) | Ingestion of HIV in breast milk. | Mixed feeding, cracked nipples, mastitis, high viral load,. |

### Modalities of Prevention under NACP (National AIDS Control Programme)

The strategy used in India is known as **[[PPTCT]] (Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission)**. The current policy adopts the **"Lifelong ART"** approach (formerly WHO Option B+) for all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV,.

#### A. Antenatal Care & Screening
*   **Universal Screening:** Routine offer of HIV counseling and testing to **all** pregnant women enrolled in antenatal care (ANC) with an **"Opt-out"** policy,.
*   **Spousal Testing:** Involvement of the spouse and family members is crucial.

#### B. Maternal Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)
*   **Eligibility:** All HIV-infected pregnant and breastfeeding women are initiated on **Lifelong ART** regardless of their [[CD4 count]] or WHO clinical stage,.
*   **Standard Regimen (Triple Drug Therapy):** The preferred First-Line regimen is a Fixed Dose Combination (FDC) of:
    *   **[[Tenofovir]] (TDF)** (300 mg)
    *   **[[Lamivudine]] (3TC)** (300 mg)
    *   **[[Efavirenz]] (EFV)** (600 mg)
    *   *Note: This is taken as a single pill once daily*,.
*   **Timing:** Start as early as possible in pregnancy (preferably 14 weeks onwards) and continue for life.

#### C. Intranatal (Delivery) Interventions
*   **Institutional Delivery:** Promoted to ensure safe and hygienic conditions.
*   **Avoid Invasive Procedures:** Avoid Artificial Rupture of Membranes (ARM), fetal scalp electrodes, and routine episiotomy.
*   **Mode of Delivery:**
    *   **Elective Caesarean Section (LSCS):** Reduces risk by 50% compared to vaginal delivery but is performed based on obstetric indications or if viral load is high,.
    *   Vaginal delivery is acceptable if the mother is on suppressive ART with low viral load.

#### D. Infant Prophylaxis
The newborn is given **[[Nevirapine]] (NVP)** syrup to prevent infection.
*   **Initiation:** Immediately after birth.
*   **Duration:** Minimum of **6 weeks**.
    *   *Extended to 12 weeks* if the mother was not on ART for sufficient duration or has high viral load.
*   **Dosage (Based on Birth Weight):**
    *   **< 2.0 kg:** 0.2 ml/kg (2 mg/kg) Once Daily.
    *   **2.0 – 2.5 kg:** 1.0 ml (10 mg) Once Daily.
    *   **> 2.5 kg:** 1.5 ml (15 mg) Once Daily.

#### E. Infant Feeding Practices
*   **Recommended:** **Exclusive Breastfeeding (EBF)** for the first **6 months**,.
*   **Avoid Mixed Feeding:** Strictly avoid mixing breast milk with other fluids/foods (animal milk, water, solids) as this damages the infant's gut lining and significantly increases transmission risk.
*   **Weaning:** Introduce complementary foods at 6 months and continue breastfeeding for 12 months to 2 years, provided the mother is adhering to ART,.

#### F. Early Infant Diagnosis (EID) and Follow-up
*   **Testing:** HIV antibody tests (ELISA) are not useful in infants <18 months due to maternal antibodies.
*   **Diagnostic Test:** **[[HIV DNA PCR]]** using Dried Blood Spot (DBS).
    *   **1st Test:** At **6 weeks** of age (along with immunization),.
    *   **Confirmation:** If positive, repeat immediately with whole blood sample.
    *   **Final Confirmation:** Antibody test at **18 months**.
*   **CPT:** Initiation of **Co-trimoxazole Prophylactic Therapy** at 6 weeks to prevent *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia,.

### Clinical Relevance: "The 4 Prongs"
To remember the comprehensive strategy of PPTCT, think of the **4 Prongs**:
1.  **Prong 1:** Prevention of new HIV infections in women of childbearing age.
2.  **Prong 2:** Prevention of unintended pregnancies in women living with HIV.
3.  **Prong 3:** Prevention of HIV transmission from an HIV-infected woman to her infant (The ART/NVP steps).
4.  **Prong 4:** Provision of care, treatment, and support for mothers living with HIV and their children and families.

### Mnemonic for PPTCT Steps
**"M-B-A"**
*   **M**other takes Triple Drug ART (Lifelong).
*   **B**aby takes Nevirapine Syrup (6 weeks).
*   **A**void Mixed Feeding (Exclusive Breastfeeding only).
