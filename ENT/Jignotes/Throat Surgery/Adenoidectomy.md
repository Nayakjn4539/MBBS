# [[Throat Surgery]] > Adenoidectomy

### **Adenoidectomy**

**Definition**
[[Adenoidectomy]] is the surgical removal of the [[nasopharyngeal tonsil]] (adenoids). It is one of the most common surgical procedures performed in pediatric otorhinolaryngology, often combined with [[tonsillectomy]] (adenotonsillectomy).

**Applied Anatomy of Adenoids**
*   **Location:** Subepithelial collection of lymphoid tissue situated at the junction of the roof and posterior wall of the [[nasopharynx]].
*   **Structure:** Composed of vertical ridges of lymphoid tissue separated by deep clefts. Unlike [[palatine tonsils]], adenoids have **no capsule** and **no crypts**.
*   **Epithelium:** Covered by ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium (respiratory epithelium), with patches of stratified squamous epithelium.
*   **Growth Cycle:** Present at birth, physiological enlargement occurs up to 6 years (immunologically active age), then atrophy starts at puberty and usually disappears by age 20.
*   **Blood Supply:**
    *   Ascending palatine branch of [[facial artery]].
    *   Ascending pharyngeal artery.
    *   Pharyngeal branch of [[maxillary artery]].
    *   Ascending cervical branch of inferior thyroid artery.

### **Clinical Features of Adenoid Hypertrophy**
Enlarged adenoids act as a space-occupying lesion in the nasopharynx and a focus of infection.

**1. Nasal Symptoms**
*   **Nasal Obstruction:** Most common symptom; leads to mouth breathing and difficulty in suckling in infants.
*   **Nasal Discharge:** Mucoid or mucopurulent due to associated chronic rhinosinusitis (wet bubbly nose).
*   **Voice Change:** Voice loses nasal quality (toneless) resulting in **Rhinolalia Clausa** (hyponasality).

**2. Aural Symptoms**
*   **Eustachian Tube Dysfunction:** Adenoid mass blocks the [[Eustachian tube]] orifice.
*   **Otitis Media:** Recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) or [[Otitis Media with Effusion]] (OME/Glue ear) leading to conductive hearing loss.

**3. General Symptoms and Facies**
*   **Adenoid Facies:** Characteristic appearance due to chronic nasal obstruction and mouth breathing.
    *   Elongated face with dull expression.
    *   Open mouth and pinched nose (disuse atrophy of alae nasi).
    *   High arched palate.
    *   Crowding of upper teeth (malocclusion).
    *   Hitched up upper lip.
*   **Sleep Apnea:** Snoring and [[Obstructive Sleep Apnea]] (OSA).
*   **Cor Pulmonale:** Pulmonary hypertension due to long-standing airway obstruction (rare).

---

### **Pre-operative Assessment**
*   **Clinical Exam:** Anterior rhinoscopy (to rule out other causes of obstruction), assessment of palate (for submucous cleft).
*   **X-ray Nasopharynx (Lateral View):** To assess the size of the adenoid mass and airway compromise (Fujioka method/Adenoid-Nasopharyngeal ratio).
*   **Diagnostic Nasal Endoscopy:** Useful to visualize the degree of choanal obstruction and relation to the Eustachian tube.
*   **Audiometry/Tympanometry:** If hearing loss or OME is suspected.
*   **Coagulation Profile:** Essential to rule out bleeding disorders.

### **Indications for Adenoidectomy**

| Category | Specific Indications |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Obstruction** | • [[Obstructive Sleep Apnea]] (OSA) syndrome.<br>• Chronic mouth breathing and snoring.<br>• [[Adenoid facies]] and dental malocclusion.<br>• Speech abnormalities ([[Rhinolalia clausa]]). |
| **Infection** | • Recurrent [[rhinosinusitis]] despite medical therapy.<br>• Purulent adenoiditis.<br>• Chronic adenoiditis acting as a septic focus. |
| **Otologic** | • [[Otitis Media with Effusion]] (OME) persisting > 3 months (often combined with grommet insertion).<br>• Recurrent acute [[otitis media]].<br>• Recurrent ear discharge in benign [[CSOM]]. |

### **Contraindications**

**Absolute**
*   **Cleft Palate:** Overt cleft palate or **[[Submucous cleft palate]]** (bifid uvula). Removal causes **[[Velopharyngeal insufficiency]]** (VPI), leading to hypernasal speech and nasal regurgitation.
*   **Acute Infection:** Surgery should be deferred until infection resolves.
*   **Bleeding Disorders:** Hemophilia, leukemia, purpura.

**Relative**
*   Age < 3 years (unless severe obstruction exists).
*   Polio epidemic (risk of bulbar polio).
*   Anemia (Hb < 10g%).

### **Surgical Procedure**

**Anesthesia**
*   General Anesthesia (GA) with oral endotracheal intubation.

**Position**
*   **[[Rose’s position]]**: Patient supine with a sandbag under the shoulders to extend the neck. The head is stabilized on a head ring (preventing hyperextension).

**Techniques**
1.  **Conventional Curettage (Cold Method):**
    *   **Mouth Gag:** [[Boyle-Davis mouth gag]] inserted to open the mouth; tongue retracted.
    *   **Palpation:** Digital examination of nasopharynx to assess size and rule out aberrant pulsations.
    *   **Instrument:** **[[St. Clair Thomson adenoid curette]]** (with or without cage/guard).
    *   **Procedure:** Curette is introduced behind the soft palate until it touches the posterior border of the nasal septum. With a sweeping movement, the adenoid mass is shaved off. A curette *without* a cage is used for lateral masses to avoid injury to the Eustachian tube.
    *   **Hemostasis:** Nasopharynx is packed with gauze packs for a few minutes.

2.  **Endoscopic Assisted Adenoidectomy:**
    *   Performed under direct vision using 0° or 70° nasal endoscope.
    *   **Suction Diathermy/Coblation:** Uses radiofrequency energy to ablate tissue (less thermal damage, better hemostasis).
    *   **Microdebrider (Shaver):** Powered instrument that shaves and suctions tissue simultaneously. More precise.

**Clinical Implication:**
*   **Submucous Cleft Palate Check:** Always palpate the hard palate for a notch and inspect the uvula (bifid uvula) before surgery. If missed, adenoidectomy can result in disastrous speech problems (VPI).

### **Complications**

**Immediate**
*   **Hemorrhage:** Primary or Reactionary. Can be due to adenoid remnants or injury to aberrant vessels.
    *   *Management:* Postnasal packing or electrocoagulation under GA.
*   **Injury to Adjacent Structures:**
    *   **[[Eustachian tube]] orifice:** Leading to stenosis or OME.
    *   **Uvula/Soft Palate:** Accidental amputation or trauma.
    *   **Teeth/Lips:** Injury from the mouth gag.
*   **Aspiration:** Blood or adenoid tissue causing airway obstruction (Coroner's clot).

**Delayed**
*   **Secondary Hemorrhage:** Rare, usually due to infection (5th–10th day).
*   **[[Grisel’s Syndrome]] (Nasopharyngeal Torticollis):** Inflammatory subluxation of the atlanto-axial joint due to infection spreading from the pharynx to prevertebral muscles. Patient presents with stiff neck and tilted head.
*   **Velopharyngeal Insufficiency (VPI):** Hypernasal speech (Rhinolalia Aperta) and nasal regurgitation. Common if submucous cleft was missed.
*   **Nasopharyngeal Stenosis:** Scarring leading to narrowing.
*   **Recurrence:** Regrowth of lymphoid tissue if removal was incomplete.
