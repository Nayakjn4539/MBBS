# [[Thanatology]] > Declaration of Death

### Declaration of Death

**Definition**
Scientifically, death is not a momentary event but a process. However, legally and socially, it requires a specific moment of declaration.
*   **Medical Definition:** Permanent and irreversible cessation of the vital functions of the body, i.e., functions of the brain, heart, and lungs.
*   **Legal Definition (Section 46 IPC):** Death denotes the death of a human being unless the contrary appears from the context.
*   **Registration of Births and Deaths Act:** Permanent disappearance of all evidence of life at any time after live birth has taken place.

#### Stages of Death
Death occurs in two distinct stages. It is crucial to distinguish between them for the purpose of [[Organ Transplantation]].

| Feature | [[Somatic Death]] (Systemic/Clinical Death) | [[Molecular Death]] (Cellular Death) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | Complete and irreversible cessation of circulation, respiration, and brain function. | Death of individual tissues and cells after somatic death. |
| **Timing** | Immediate. The person is legally dead. | Occurs 1-2 hours after somatic death. |
| **Metabolic Activity** | Stops in the vital centers (Tripod of life). | Continues in tissues (muscles, skin, cornea) for some time. |
| **Response to Stimuli** | Muscles may respond to electrical/chemical stimuli. | No response to any stimuli. |
| **Importance** | Time for certification of death. Window for organ harvesting. | Signs of death (Rigor mortis, Lividity) appear. |

#### Modes of Death
Known as **Bichat's Tripod of Life**. Death begins with the failure of one of the three vital systems, eventually leading to the failure of the others.

1.  **[[Coma]]:** Failure of the **Central Nervous System** (Brain).
    *   *Causes:* Head injury, intracranial hemorrhage, poisons (Opium, Alcohol), metabolic disorders (Uremia).
2.  **[[Syncope]]:** Failure of the **Circulatory System** (Heart).
    *   *Causes:* Myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, massive hemorrhage, vagal inhibition.
3.  **[[Asphyxia]]:** Failure of the **Respiratory System** (Lungs).
    *   *Causes:* Hanging, strangulation, drowning, respiratory paralysis.

#### Brain Death (Brainstem Death)
With the advent of ventilators and life-support systems, the traditional definition (cessation of heart/lungs) became insufficient. The concept of [[Brain Death]] is essential for cadaveric organ transplantation.

**Definition:**
It is the irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brainstem. The [[Brainstem]] controls vital functions like respiration and consciousness (Reticular Activating System).

**Criteria for Diagnosis (The Harvard Criteria/UK Code):**
Three essential preconditions must be met before testing:
1.  Patient must be deeply comatose.
2.  Patient must be on a ventilator (apneic).
3.  Cause of coma must be confirmed (structural brain damage) and reversible causes (drugs, hypothermia <35°C, metabolic alkalosis) must be excluded.

**Tests for Brainstem Death**
These tests confirm the absence of brainstem reflexes. They must be performed by **two doctors** twice, with an interval of **6 hours** (as per THOA).

1.  **Pupillary Reflex:** Pupils are fixed, dilated, and non-reactive to light (CN II & III).
2.  **Corneal Reflex:** Absent blink response when cornea is touched (CN V & VII).
3.  **Vestibulo-ocular Reflex (Caloric Test):** No eye movement when ice-cold water is injected into the ear (CN VIII, III, VI).
4.  **Gag Reflex:** Absent when posterior pharynx is stimulated (CN IX & X).
5.  **Cough Reflex:** Absent upon bronchial stimulation/suctioning (CN X).
6.  **Motor Response:** No motor response to painful stimuli in cranial nerve distribution (e.g., supraorbital pressure).

**The Confirmatory Test: [[Apnea Test]]**
This is the ultimate test to check the integrity of the respiratory center in the medulla.
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Pre-oxygenate with 100% $O_2$ for 10 minutes.
    2.  Disconnect the ventilator while delivering $O_2$ via a tracheal catheter (6 L/min).
    3.  Observe for respiratory movements for up to 10 minutes.
    4.  Draw Arterial Blood Gas (ABG).
*   **Positive Result (Confirming Death):**
    *   No respiratory movements observed.
    *   $PaCO_2$ rises $\ge$ 60 mmHg (or rises by $\ge$ 20 mmHg from baseline).

#### Legal Procedure for Declaration (THOA 1994)
Under the **[[Transplantation of Human Organs Act]] (1994)**, a specific panel of experts is required to certify brainstem death.

**The Medical Board ("HINT" Mnemonic):**
1.  **H** - **H**ospital In-charge (Medical Superintendent/RMP in charge).
2.  **I** - **I**ndependent Specialist (Nominated from a panel approved by Appropriate Authority).
3.  **N** - **N**eurologist or Neurosurgeon (If unavailable, an anesthetist/intensivist/surgeon nominated from the panel).
4.  **T** - **T**reating Medical Officer.

*Note: The transplant surgeon cannot be a member of this board to avoid conflict of interest.*

#### Suspended Animation
A state where life processes (respiration and circulation) are depressed to such a low level that they are undetectable by routine clinical methods, giving a false appearance of death.

**Causes (Mnemonic: A-E-I-O-U):**
*   **A** - **A**naesthesia (Overdose) / **A**sphyxia neonatorum.
*   **E** - **E**lectrocution.
*   **I** - **I**njury (Head injury) / **I**nsanity (Trance, Catalepsy).
*   **O** - **O**pium/Barbiturate poisoning.
*   **U** - **U**remia / Hypothermia (**U**nder temperature). Or **D**rowning/Sunstroke.

**Voluntary Suspended Animation:**
Seen in practitioners of Yoga (*Sadhu*) who can lower metabolic rate significantly.

**Medicolegal Importance:**
*   Premature declaration of death may lead to being buried alive.
*   Relevant in cases of resuscitation (should be continued until death is absolute).

---

#### Confirmation of Death (Traditional Signs)
When brain death criteria are not applicable (routine cases), death is confirmed by:
1.  **Circulation:** No pulse, no heart sounds (auscultate for 5 mins), flat ECG.
    *   *Magnus Test:* Ligature on finger -> No congestion/color change (obsolete).
    *   *Diaphanous Test:* Transillumination of web of fingers -> No red glow (obsolete).
2.  **Respiration:** Mirror test (no misting), Feather test (no movement).
3.  **Eye Signs:** Segmentation of retinal vessels (**Kevorkian sign**), loss of corneal reflex, haziness of cornea.

### Medicolegal Aspects of Declaration of Death
1.  **Organ Transplantation:** Precise declaration of brainstem death allows for harvesting of viable organs (Heart, Kidneys, Liver).
2.  **Inheritance/Property:** The exact time of death determines succession in cases of *Commorientes* (persons dying together, e.g., in a plane crash).
3.  **Criminal Liability:** In homicide, the victim must be legally dead.
4.  **"Switching Off" Support:** Doctors are legally protected when withdrawing life support after brain death certification under THOA.
