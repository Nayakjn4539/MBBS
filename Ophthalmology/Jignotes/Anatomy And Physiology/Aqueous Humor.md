# Aqueous Humor

## General Characteristics
The [[Aqueous Humor]] is a clear, watery, transparent fluid that fills the anterior and posterior chambers of the eye. It plays a vital role in maintaining the structural integrity and functional health of the optical system.

*   **Volume:** Total volume is approximately **0.31 mL**.
    *   **Anterior Chamber (AC):** ~0.25 mL
    *   **Posterior Chamber (PC):** ~0.06 mL
*   **Refractive Index:** 1.336 (slightly lower than the cornea and lens).
*   **Density:** 1.025-1.040.
*   **pH:** 7.2 (slightly acidic compared to plasma pH of 7.4).
*   **Osmolarity:** Slightly hyperosmotic to plasma (by 3–5 mOsm/L).
*   **Rate of Production:** ~2.3 $\mu$L/min.
*   **Turnover rate:** About 1% of the anterior chamber volume per minute; the entire volume is replaced every 100 minutes.

### Functions
1.  **Metabolic Role:** Provides nutrition (glucose, amino acids, oxygen) to the avascular structures of the eye, specifically the [[Cornea]] and [[Crystalline Lens]]. It also removes metabolic wastes (lactate, CO2).
2.  **Maintenance of Intraocular Pressure (IOP):** Essential for maintaining the shape of the globe and proper optical alignment.
3.  **Optical Function:** Provides a transparent medium for light transmission.
4.  **Clearing Function:** Acts as a lymph-substitute to clear blood, macrophages, and inflammatory products from the anterior chamber.
5.  **Immune Privilege:** Contains immunoglobulins and factors that contribute to the eye's immune privilege.

## Biochemical Composition
The composition of aqueous humor is similar to plasma but with specific differences due to the **[[Blood-Aqueous Barrier]]** (tight junctions in the non-pigmented ciliary epithelium and iris vessels).

| Constituent | Concentration in Aqueous vs. Plasma | Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Water** | 99.9% (Higher) | Transparent medium. |
| **Proteins** | **Very Low** (5-16 mg% vs 6-7 gm% in plasma) | Low protein prevents light scattering (Tyndall effect). |
| **Ascorbate (Vit C)** | **Much Higher** (20x plasma) | Acts as an antioxidant to protect the lens and retina from UV damage. |
| **Lactate** | **Higher** | Product of anaerobic metabolism of the lens/cornea. |
| **Glucose** | Lower (~80% of plasma) | Source of energy. |
| **Bicarbonate** | High (Posterior Chamber) | Critical for active secretion. |
| **Oxygen** | Dissolved state | Supplies corneal endothelium and lens. |

**Clinical Implication:**
*   **[[Plasmoid Aqueous]]:** In conditions like [[Uveitis]], the blood-aqueous barrier breaks down, causing proteins to leak into the aqueous. This scatters light, visible on a slit lamp as **[[Aqueous Flare]]** (Tyndall phenomenon).

## Formation of Aqueous Humor
Aqueous humor is derived from plasma within the capillary network of the [[Ciliary Processes]]. It is produced primarily by the **Non-Pigmented Epithelium (NPE)** of the ciliary body.

### Mechanisms of Formation
There are three mechanisms involved:

1.  **Active Secretion (Major Mechanism ~ 70-80%):**
    *   Occurs in the **Non-Pigmented Epithelium (NPE)**.
    *   It is energy-dependent and pressure-independent.
    *   **Mechanism:** Mediated by enzymes like **[[Na+/K+ ATPase]]** and **[[Carbonic Anhydrase]]**. Sodium is actively transported into the posterior chamber, creating an osmotic gradient that pulls water and other substances with it.
    *   **Regulation:** Influenced by the sympathetic nervous system (Beta-2 receptors increase secretion; Alpha-2 receptors decrease secretion).

2.  **Ultrafiltration (~ 20%):**
    *   Pressure-dependent passive flow of fluid from ciliary capillaries into the ciliary stroma.
    *   Driven by the hydrostatic pressure difference between capillary blood pressure and IOP.

3.  **Diffusion (~ 10%):**
    *   Passive movement of solutes down a concentration gradient.

**Clinical Implication:**
*   **Drugs decreasing formation:**
    *   **[[Beta-blockers]]** (e.g., Timolol) and **[[Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors]]** (e.g., Acetazolamide) reduce active secretion to lower IOP in [[Glaucoma]].
    *   **Alpha-2 agonists** (e.g., Brimonidine) decrease cyclic AMP, reducing secretion.

## Circulation of Aqueous Humor
1.  Secreted into the **[[Posterior Chamber]]**.
2.  Flows through the **[[Pupil]]** into the **[[Anterior Chamber]]**.
3.  Circulates in the AC via **Thermal Convection Currents**:
    *   The cornea is cooler (avscular/exposed to air) $\rightarrow$ Fluid cools and sinks.
    *   The iris is warmer (vascular) $\rightarrow$ Fluid warms and rises.
    *   *Result:* Downward flow near the cornea, upward flow near the iris.
4.  Exits via the filtration angle.

**Clinical Implication:**
*   **Krukenberg Spindle:** In Pigment Dispersion Syndrome, pigment follows convection currents and deposits vertically on the corneal endothelium.
*   **Pupillary Block:** If adhesions form between the iris and lens ([[Posterior Synechiae]]), aqueous cannot flow into the AC, pushing the iris forward (**Iris Bombe**) causing [[Angle Closure Glaucoma]].

## Drainage (Outflow) Pathways
There are two principal pathways for aqueous drainage.

> Flowchart showing Trabecular vs Uveoscleral outflow pathways

### 1. Trabecular / Conventional Outflow (Major Pathway: 70-90%)
This pathway is **pressure-dependent**. Drainage occurs through the angle of the anterior chamber (iridocorneal angle).

*   **pathway:**
    1.  **[[Trabecular Meshwork]] (TM):**
        *   *Uveal Meshwork:* Innermost, large pores (least resistance).
        *   *Corneoscleral Meshwork:* Middle layer.
        *   *[[Juxtacanalicular Tissue]] (Cribriform layer):* Outermost layer adjacent to Schlemm's canal. **Site of highest resistance** to outflow.
    2.  **[[Schlemm's Canal]]:** An endothelial-lined circular channel. Aqueous enters via giant vacuoles.
    3.  **Collector Channels:** About 25–30 channels leaving Schlemm's canal.
    4.  **[[Aqueous Veins of Ascher]]:** Direct channels connecting to episcleral veins.
    5.  **[[Episcleral Veins]]:** Final drainage into venous circulation.

**Clinical Implication:**
*   In **[[Primary Open Angle Glaucoma]] (POAG)**, resistance usually increases at the juxtacanalicular meshwork/inner wall of Schlemm's canal.
*   **Miotics (Pilocarpine):** Contract the ciliary muscle, pulling on the scleral spur and opening the trabecular meshwork to increase this outflow.
*   **Raised Episcleral Venous Pressure:** Conditions like Sturge-Weber syndrome or Carotid-Cavernous Fistula raise pressure here, causing secondary glaucoma.

### 2. Uveoscleral / Unconventional Outflow (Minor Pathway: 10-30%)
This pathway is **pressure-independent** (as long as IOP > episcleral pressure).

*   **Pathway:**
    1.  Aqueous passes through the root of the iris.
    2.  Enters the interstitial spaces of the **[[Ciliary Muscle]]**.
    3.  Flows into the **[[Suprachoroidal Space]]**.
    4.  Absorbed into the sclera or vortex veins.

**Clinical Implication:**
*   **Prostaglandin Analogues (e.g., Latanoprost):** The most potent ocular hypotensive drugs work by remodeling the extracellular matrix of the ciliary muscle, drastically increasing uveoscleral outflow.
*   **Atropine:** Can reduce uveoscleral outflow slightly by relaxing the ciliary muscle (compacting the spaces), though clinically less significant than its cycloplegic effect.

## Summary of Dynamics (Mnemonics)

**To remember the Outflow:**
*   **T**rabecular = **T**raditional (Conventional, Main route).
*   **U**veoscleral = **U**nconventional (Alternative route).

**To remember Aqueous Composition:**
*   **HALL** (Higher in Aqueous): **H**ydrogen ions (low pH), **A**scorbate, **L**actate.
*   **L**ow in Aqueous: **L**arge proteins, **L**ipids.
