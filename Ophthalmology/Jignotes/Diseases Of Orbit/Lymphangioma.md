# Orbital Lymphangioma

### Overview
[[Orbital lymphangioma]] is a rare, benign, vascular tumor of the orbit. Unlike [[capillary hemangioma]] which is common in infants, or [[cavernous hemangioma]] which is common in adults, lymphangiomas present with specific clinical characteristics related to their lymphatic vascular nature.

### Classification
It falls under the category of **Vascular Tumors** of the orbit.
*   **Primary Benign Tumors:** Along with haemangiomas.

### Etiology and Pathogenesis
*   **Origin:** It is a developmental anomaly of the lymphatic system.
*   **Structural characteristics:** It consists of vascular spaces.
*   **Pathophysiology of Acute Presentation:** The tumor often enlarges **suddenly** because of **spontaneous hemorrhage** within the vascular spaces. This bleeding leads to the formation of blood-filled cysts known as **"Chocolate Cysts"**.

### Clinical Features
The presentation can vary based on location (conjunctival vs. orbital) and the presence of hemorrhage.

#### 1. General Presentation
*   **Age:** Typically presents in a **young person**.
*   **Onset:** Usually presents as a **slowly progressive proptosis**.

#### 2. Acute Presentation ("Chocolate Cyst")
*   Sudden worsening of [[proptosis]].
*    caused by spontaneous bleeding into the tumor spaces.
*   These blood-filled cysts are termed [[Chocolate cysts]].
*   These cysts may regress spontaneously over time.

#### 3. Intermittent Proptosis
*   [[Orbital lymphangioma]] is a known cause of **intermittent proptosis**,.
*   **Precipitating Factors:**
    *   The proptosis may increase with **Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI)**.
    *   It may increase on bending forward or Valsalva maneuver (similar to [[orbital varices]]).

#### 4. Conjunctival Lymphangioma
*   **Appearance:** Rare, solitary **multilocular cyst**,.
*   **Location:** Bulbar conjunctiva.
*   **Lymphangiectasis:** Characterized by a row of small cysts due to dilatation of lymph spaces.

### Diagnosis
*   **Clinical Examination:** History of intermittent proptosis associated with URTI or sudden onset proptosis (hemorrhage) in a young patient.
*   **Imaging:**
    *   **[[Ultrasound]] (B-scan):** Useful to differentiate solid vs cystic lesions.
    *   **[[MRI]]:** Can delineate the cystic spaces and fluid levels (hemorrhage).

### Clinical Implications
*   **Differential Diagnosis:** Must be distinguished from [[Orbital Varices]] (which also cause intermittent proptosis) and [[Capillary Hemangioma]] (common in children).
*   **Prognosis:** The condition can be difficult to manage due to its infiltrative nature, but the hemorrhagic cysts ("chocolate cysts") often show **spontaneous regression**.
