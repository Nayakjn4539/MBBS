# [[Surgical Procedures]] > Arthroplasty (Total Knee Replacement - TKR)

### Arthroplasty: Total Knee Replacement (TKR)

[[Total Knee Replacement]] (TKR), also referred to as [[Total Knee Arthroplasty]], is a surgical procedure where the damaged articular surfaces of the knee joint are resected and replaced with artificial components. It is technically a **resurfacing operation** rather than a true replacement of the entire joint structure.

### Indications and Contraindications

#### Indications
The primary indication is painful, disabling arthritis that significantly affects the patient's quality of life and function.
*   **[[Osteoarthritis]] (OA):** The most common indication.
*   **[[Rheumatoid Arthritis]] (RA):**
*   **Post-traumatic Arthritis:**.
*   **Other inflammatory arthropathies.**

#### Contraindications
**Absolute:**
*   Active [[Sepsis]] or focus of infection.
*   [[Neuropathic Joint]] (Charcot's joint).
*   Insufficient [[Extensor Mechanism]].

**Relative:**
*   Young age (<50 years).
*   Morbid [[Obesity]].
*   Physically demanding professions.

### Implant Components
An artificial knee joint typically consists of four main components:
1.  **[[Femoral Component]]:** A U-shaped metallic component (usually Cobalt-Chromium) that caps the prepared distal femur.
2.  **[[Tibial Base Plate]]:** A metallic tray (usually Titanium) covering the cut proximal tibia.
3.  **[[Polyethylene Insert]]:** A high-density plastic tray inserted between the femoral and tibial metallic components to serve as the articular surface.
4.  **[[Patellar Button]]:** A polyethylene dome used to resurface the articular side of the patella (optional).

### Types of Knee Arthroplasty

| Type | Description | Indication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Total Knee Replacement]] (TKR)** | Resurfacing of both femoral and tibial condyles. | Tricompartmental disease. |
| **[[Unicondylar Knee Replacement]] (UKR)** | Replacement of only one compartment (usually medial). Ligaments are preserved. | Strictly localized partial damage (e.g., medial compartment OA). |
| **PCL Retaining** | The [[Posterior Cruciate Ligament]] is preserved. | Depends on PCL integrity and surgeon preference. |
| **PCL Sacrificing** | The PCL is excised; the implant design provides stability (cam and post mechanism). | Severe deformity or PCL deficiency. |

### Surgical Technique (Step-by-Step)

The procedure relies on precise bone cuts using specialized jigs to ensure optimal alignment and soft tissue balance,.

#### 1. Approach and Exposure
*   **Incision:** A straight anterior skin incision is made.
*   **Arthrotomy:** A medial [[Parapatellar Arthrotomy]] is performed to expose the joint.
*   **Soft Tissue Clearance:** The [[Patella]] is everted. Remnants of the [[Menisci]] and the [[Anterior Cruciate Ligament]] (ACL) are excised. Osteophytes are removed.

#### 2. Femoral Preparation
*   **Distal Cut:** A distal femoral cut is made perpendicular to the mechanical axis.
*   **Sizing:** The femur is sized to select the correct component.
*   **Chamfer Cuts:** Anterior, posterior, and chamfer cuts are made using specific cutting blocks to match the internal geometry of the femoral component.

#### 3. Tibial Preparation
*   **Proximal Cut:** The upper end of the tibia is cut flat.
*   **Alignment:** Care is taken to avoid internal rotation of the tibial component. The cut is usually perpendicular to the long axis of the tibia.

#### 4. Trial Reduction and Balancing
*   Trial components are inserted.
*   **Stability Check:** The knee is tested in flexion and extension to ensure stability and proper ligament tension. Soft tissue release may be needed to correct varus/valgus deformities.
*   **[[Patellar Tracking]]:** The patella must track centrally within the trochlear groove without requiring pressure.

#### 5. Cementing and Closure
*   **Pulsatile Lavage:** Bony surfaces are cleansed.
*   **Cementing:** [[Bone Cement]] (Polymethyl Methacrylate) is applied, and the final femoral and tibial components are impacted into place,.
*   **Insert:** The polyethylene liner is locked into the tibial base plate.
*   **Closure:** The arthrotomy is closed with absorbable sutures. A suction drain may be placed.

### Recent Advances
*   **[[Computer Navigation]]:** Ensures higher accuracy in bone cuts and limb alignment during surgery.
*   **Robotic-Assisted TKR:** Further enhances precision.

### Postoperative Rehabilitation
*   **Mobilization:** The patient is usually allowed to move the limb the next day or even the same day.
*   **Exercises:** Active and active-assisted exercises for the hip and knee are initiated.
*   **Weight Bearing:** Bedside standing with a walker is permitted after 2–3 days (or sooner depending on protocol).
*   **Long-term:** Patients are advised to avoid high-impact activities to prolong prosthesis survival. Expected survival of the prosthesis is 15–20 years.

### Complications

| Complication | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Infection]]** | Can be superficial or deep. Major infection may require removal of the prosthesis and arthrodesis. |
| **[[Deep Vein Thrombosis]] (DVT)** | A significant risk; prophylaxis is essential. Can lead to pulmonary embolism. |
| **Loosening** | Aseptic loosening is the most common cause of long-term failure. |
| **[[Periprosthetic Fracture]]** | Can occur intraoperatively or postoperatively due to stress concentration. |
| **Stiffness** | Inability to regain range of motion due to adhesions or heterotopic ossification. |
| **Extensor Mechanism Failure** | Avulsion of [[Patellar Tendon]] or fracture of the patella. |
| **Neurovascular Injury** | Rare, but possible. |

### Clinical Implications
*   **"TKR is a soft tissue operation":** While bone cuts are important, the outcome depends heavily on soft tissue balancing (ligaments) to ensure the joint is stable throughout the range of motion.
*   **Antibiotic Prophylaxis:** Crucial to prevent catastrophic deep infection.
