# [[Preventive Medicine In Obstetrics, Paediatrics And Geriatrics]] > Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illnesses

### [[Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illnesses]] (IMNCI)

IMNCI is a major strategy under the [[National Rural Health Mission]] (NRHM) and [[RCH]] Phase II programme. It is the Indian adaptation of the WHO/UNICEF strategy known as IMCI. The core philosophy is that children often present with overlapping signs and symptoms of diseases, requiring a holistic/integrated approach rather than a vertical disease-specific one.

### Objectives
1.  Reduce mortality and morbidity associated with major causes of childhood illness.
2.  Promote healthy growth and development of children.

### Target Groups
1.  **Young Infants:** Age 0 to 2 months (0–59 days).
2.  **Children:** Age 2 months to 5 years.

---

### Three Core Components
The strategy stands on three pillars to ensure effectiveness:
1.  **Improvement in Case Management Skills:** Training health staff (Doctors, ANMs, ASHAs) to assess and treat effectively.
2.  **Improvement in Health Systems:** Ensuring availability of drugs, logistics, supervision, and referral mechanisms.
3.  **Improvement in Family and Community Practices:** Promotion of breastfeeding, immunization, and recognizing danger signs at home.

### Difference between Global [[IMCI]] and Indian [[IMNCI]]
India adapted the global model to suit local epidemiological needs.

| Feature | Global IMCI | Indian IMNCI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Age Coverage** | Excludes 0–7 days (early neonates). | **Includes 0–7 days** (crucial for reducing neonatal mortality). |
| **Training Focus** | Focuses mostly on older children. | **50% of training time** is devoted to the management of young infants (0–2 months). |
| **Guidelines** | General guidelines. | Incorporates Indian National guidelines for **Malaria, Anemia, Vitamin A, and Immunization**. |
| **Approach** | Facility-based. | Skill-based interaction involving **Home Visits** by health workers (HBNC). |

---

### Diseases Covered
The strategy focuses on the "Big Killers" of children under 5:
*   Acute Respiratory Infections ([[Pneumonia]])
*   [[Diarrhea]]
*   [[Measles]]
*   [[Malaria]]
*   [[Malnutrition]] and Anemia

---

### The Case Management Process
The health worker follows a standard protocol for every sick child visiting the health facility.

**Mnemonic: A C I T C F** (A City Café)
1.  **A**ssess: Check for general danger signs, symptoms, nutrition, and immunization status.
2.  **C**lassify: Categorize illness based on color-coded triage.
3.  **I**dentify treatment: Determine specific medical treatment or advice.
4.  **T**reat: Give the first dose (e.g., antibiotic/ORS) at the clinic.
5.  **C**ounsel: Teach the mother about feeding, fluids, and *when to return*.
6.  **F**ollow-up: Give follow-up care when the child returns.

### Color-Coded Triage System (Classification)
Based on the assessment of signs, the child's illness is classified into one of three color categories:

| Color Code | Severity | Action Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PINK** | **Severe Disease** | • Urgent Hospital Referral.<br>• Give pre-referral treatment (1st dose of antibiotic/antimalarial). |
| **YELLOW** | **Specific Illness** | • Treat at the outpatient health facility (e.g., Oral antibiotics, Oral antimalarials).<br>• Advise home care. |
| **GREEN** | **Home Management** | • No specific medicine needed.<br>• Counsel on home care (feeding, fluids).<br>• Advise when to return. |

---

### General Danger Signs (Children 2 months – 5 years)
If **ANY** of these are present, the child is classified as having **Very Severe Disease** (PINK).

**Mnemonic: V-C-L-U** (Like a Flu)
*   **V**omits everything.
*   **C**onvulsions (history of, or current).
*   **L**ethargic or unconscious.
*   **U**nable to drink or breastfeed.

### Assessment of Main Symptoms (Step-by-Step)

#### 1. Cough or Difficult Breathing
*   **Criteria:** Respiratory Rate (RR) and Chest Indrawing.
    *   **Fast Breathing:**
        *   2–12 months: ≥ 50 breaths/min.
        *   12 months–5 years: ≥ 40 breaths/min.
*   **Classifications:**
    *   *Severe Pneumonia (Pink):* Chest indrawing or Stridor.
    *   *Pneumonia (Yellow):* Fast breathing only.
    *   *No Pneumonia (Green):* No fast breathing/indrawing.

#### 2. Diarrhea
*   **Assess:** Lethargy, sunken eyes, ability to drink, skin pinch (turgor).
*   **Classifications:** Severe Dehydration (Pink), Some Dehydration (Yellow), No Dehydration (Green).
*   **Chronic Diarrhea:** Duration > 14 days.
*   **Dysentery:** Blood in stool.

#### 3. Fever
*   **Assess:** Stiffness of neck, malaria risk, measles history.
*   **Classifications:** Very Severe Febrile Disease, Malaria, or Fever (non-malaria).

#### 4. Ear Problems
*   **Assess:** Ear pain, discharge, tender swelling behind the ear.
*   **Classifications:** Mastoiditis (Pink), Acute/Chronic Ear Infection (Yellow).

#### 5. Malnutrition and Anemia
*   **Assess:** Visible severe wasting, palmar pallor, edema of both feet, weight-for-age.
*   **Classifications:** Severe Malnutrition (Pink), Very Low Weight (Yellow).

### Clinical Relevance & Home Care
Effective IMNCI relies heavily on counseling the mother. The mother must be taught the **3 Rules of Home Care**:
1.  **Fluids:** Give extra fluids (breast milk, ORS).
2.  **Feeding:** Continue feeding (do not stop food during illness).
3.  **Follow-up:** When to return immediately (Danger signs) and when to come for routine follow-up.
