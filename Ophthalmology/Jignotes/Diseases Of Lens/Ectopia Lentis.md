# [[Diseases Of Lens]] > Ectopia Lentis

# [[Ectopia Lentis]]

[[Ectopia Lentis]] refers to the displacement of the [[crystalline lens]] from its normal position in the [[patellar fossa]] due to partial or complete rupture of the [[zonules of Zinn]] (suspensory ligaments),.

### Classification
The displacement is classified based on the severity of zonular rupture:

| Type | Definition | Clinical Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Subluxation]]** | Partial displacement; the lens remains behind the [[pupil]]. | Zonules are partially broken or stretched. The lens edge may be visible in the pupillary area. |
| **[[Luxation]] (Dislocation)** | Complete displacement; all [[zonules]] are severed. | The lens is completely detached from the [[ciliary body]]. |

**Types of [[Luxation]] / Dislocation:**
*   **Anterior Dislocation:** Lens enters the [[anterior chamber]].
*   **Posterior Dislocation:** Lens falls into the [[vitreous cavity]] (may be floating or fixed to the [[retina]]).
*   **Floating Lens:** [[Lens nutans]].
*   **Fixed Lens:** [[Lens fixata]].

### Etiology and Associations

Causes can be broadly classified into Congenital/Hereditary and Acquired/Secondary.

#### 1. Heritable/Congenital Causes
These are often bilateral and symmetrical.

*   **[[Marfan's Syndrome]]** (Autosomal Dominant),:
    *   **Direction of dislocation:** **Superotemporal** (Up and Out).
    *   **Mechanism:** Defect in [[fibrillin-1]] gene. Zonules are intact but stretched.
    *   **Systemic features:** [[Arachnodactyly]] (long fingers), high arched palate, dissecting [[aortic aneurysm]], skeletal abnormalities.
    *   **Note:** [[Ectopia Lentis]] is the *most common* ocular manifestation of Marfan's, while [[Megalocornea]] is the *most prominent*.

*   **[[Homocystinuria]]** (Autosomal Recessive),:
    *   **Direction of dislocation:** **Inferonasal** (Down and In).
    *   **Mechanism:** Deficiency of [[cystathionine beta-synthase]] leading to accumulation of [[homocysteine]]. Zonules disintegrate/break.
    *   **Systemic features:** Mental retardation, malar flush, osteoporosis, thrombotic tendency (risk of anesthesia).
    *   **Diagnosis:** [[Sodium nitroprusside test]] (Cyanide nitroprusside test) for urine,.

*   **[[Weill-Marchesani Syndrome]]** (Autosomal Recessive),:
    *   **Direction of dislocation:** **Inferior** or **Anterior** (Forward).
    *   **Ocular features:** [[Microspherophakia]] (small spherical lens).
    *   **Systemic features:** Short stature, stubby fingers (brachydactyly), mental retardation.
    *   **Clinical Implication:** High risk of [[pupillary block glaucoma]] due to the spherical lens moving forward (Inverse Glaucoma).

*   **[[Ectopia Lentis et Pupillae]]** (Autosomal Recessive),:
    *   Lens and [[pupil]] are displaced in **opposite directions**.
    *   Pupil is often slit-shaped.

*   **Other Associations:**
    *   [[Sulfite Oxidase Deficiency]],.
    *   [[Hyperlysinemia]].
    *   [[Aniridia]] (Absence of iris).
    *   [[Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome]].

**Mnemonic for Direction of Dislocation:**
*   **Marfan's** = **S**uperior (**S**ky is up).
*   **Homocystinuria** = **In**ferior (**In**ferno is down).

#### 2. Acquired Causes
*   **Trauma:** Most common cause. Blunt trauma (concussion) causes zonular rupture,.
*   **Large Globe:** [[Buphthalmos]], High [[Myopia]] (zonules stretch and break).
*   **Inflammation:** Chronic [[Uveitis]],.
*   **Hypermature [[Cataract]]:** Degeneration of zonules.
*   **Syphilis**.

### Clinical Features

#### Symptoms
*   **Visual Disturbance:** Blurred vision due to astigmatism or refractive error changes.
*   **[[Monocular Diplopia]]:** Occurs in subluxation if the patient looks through both the phakic (lens present) and aphakic (lens absent) parts of the pupil simultaneously.
*   **Glare:** Due to scattering of light from the lens edge.
*   **Rapid change in refraction:** Frequent change of glasses.

#### Signs
1.  **[[Iridodonesis]]:** Tremulousness of the iris on eye movement (due to lack of posterior support from the lens).
2.  **[[Phacodonesis]]:** Tremulousness of the lens itself.
3.  **Anterior Chamber (AC):** Deep and irregular. Uneven depth is a key sign of subluxation,.
4.  **Visibility of Lens Edge:**
    *   **Slit Lamp:** Seen as a shining **golden crescent**,.
    *   **Distant Direct Ophthalmoscopy:** Seen as a dark crescent line against the red reflex.
5.  **Refraction Findings:**
    *   **Phakic area:** [[Myopia]] (due to increased curvature/spherophakia).
    *   **Aphakic area:** [[Hypermetropia]] (high plus power).
6.  **[[Vitreous Herniation]]:** Vitreous may prolapse into the anterior chamber.

### Complications

1.  **Refractive:** High [[astigmatism]], monocular diplopia.
2.  **[[Secondary Glaucoma]]:**
    *   **[[Phacotopic Glaucoma]]:** Anterior dislocation blocking the angle,.
    *   **Pupillary Block:** Lens incarcerating in the pupil (common in microspherophakia/Weill-Marchesani).
    *   **[[Phacolytic Glaucoma]]:** If the lens becomes hypermature.
3.  **[[Uveitis]]:** Lens-induced uveitis (phacotoxic/phacoanaphylactic) if the lens is in the vitreous.
4.  **[[Corneal Endothelial Damage]]:** If the lens dislocates anteriorly and touches the endothelium.
5.  **[[Retinal Detachment]]:** High risk in Marfan's and Stickler syndrome, or due to surgical manipulation.

### Management

**Investigation:**
*   [[Slit Lamp Examination]]: To assess zonular status and extent of subluxation.
*   [[Urine Analysis]]: Sodium nitroprusside test for [[Homocystinuria]].
*   [[Echocardiography]]: For Marfan's syndrome (aortic root dilation).

**Treatment:**

**1. Conservative Management**
*   Indicated if vision is good and no complications exist.
*   **Spectacles/Contact Lenses:** Correction usually done through the *phakic* part (if subluxation is minor) or *aphakic* part (if subluxation is major),.
*   **Miotics (Pilocarpine):** To entrap the lens behind the iris (prevent anterior dislocation) or to use the phakic aperture.
*   **Mydriatics:** To allow vision through the aphakic part if the lens bisects the visual axis.

**2. Surgical Management**
*   **Indications:**
    *   Uncorrectable visual acuity (lens edge bisecting pupil).
    *   [[Monocular diplopia]] affecting daily life.
    *   Lens in the [[anterior chamber]] (Emergency).
    *   [[Lens-induced glaucoma]] or [[Uveitis]].
    *   Mature [[Cataract]] in a subluxated lens.

*   **Surgical Options:**
    *   **Anterior Dislocation:** Emergency removal through limbal route to prevent corneal damage and glaucoma.
    *   **Posterior Dislocation:** [[Pars Plana Vitrectomy]] (PPV) + Lensectomy (to prevent retinal traction).
    *   **Subluxated Lens:**
        *   **Mild (<3 clock hours):** [[Phacoemulsification]] with PCIOL.
        *   **Moderate (3-6 clock hours):** Phacoemulsification with [[Capsular Tension Ring]] (CTR) to stabilize the bag + PCIOL.
        *   **Severe (>6-7 clock hours):** [[Cionni Ring]] fixation or Intracapsular Cataract Extraction (ICCE) / Lensectomy with [[Scleral Fixated IOL]] (SFIOL) or [[Anterior Chamber IOL]] (ACIOL),.
