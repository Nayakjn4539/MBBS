# [[Forensic Radiology]] > X-ray in Identification and Age

### **Forensic Radiology: X-ray in Identification and Age Estimation**

[[Forensic Radiology]] utilizes diagnostic imaging techniques (X-ray, CT, MRI) to assist in medicolegal investigations. It is a non-invasive method primarily used for identification, age estimation, and locating foreign bodies.

---

### **I. X-ray in Identification**

Radiological identification relies on the comparison of **Antemortem (AM)** radiographs (taken during life for medical reasons) with **Postmortem (PM)** radiographs.

#### **1. Comparative Radiography**
This is the most reliable method for positive identification, especially in decomposed, charred, or skeletonized bodies where visual identification is impossible.

*   **Skull and Sinuses:**
    *   **Frontal Sinuses:** The pattern of the [[frontal sinus]] is unique to every individual (like a fingerprint). X-rays allow comparison of the septa, scalloped upper margins, and asymmetry.
    *   **Sella Turcica:** The shape and size of the pituitary fossa are unique.
    *   **Mastoid Process:** Pneumatization patterns vary between individuals.
*   **Dental Radiography:**
    *   Comparison of root morphology, shape of pulp canal, fillings, impactions, and periodontal bone levels.
    *   **Light's criteria:** Points of concordance between AM and PM dental films.
*   **Bony Architecture:**
    *   **Trabecular Pattern:** The cancellous bone pattern (especially in the upper femur, upper tibia, and radius) is unique.
    *   **Pathologies:** Evidence of healed fractures (callus formation), bone diseases (Paget’s disease), or congenital anomalies (cervical rib, spina bifida).
    *   **Nutrient Foramina:** The position of nutrient canals in long bones is distinct.

#### **2. Implants and Foreign Bodies**
X-rays are excellent for detecting radio-opaque foreign objects which often carry serial numbers or distinct shapes.
*   **Medical Devices:** Pacemakers, orthopedic plates, screws, intramedullary nails, and prosthetic valves often have unique manufacturer codes.
*   **Projectiles:** Locating bullets, pellets, or shrapnel in firearm injuries.
*   **Body Packers:** Identification of drug packets (condoms/balloons filled with narcotics) in the stomach or intestines (Body Packer Syndrome).

### **II. X-ray in Age Estimation**

Radiology is the gold standard for age estimation in the living and skeletal remains. It relies on the chronological appearance of [[ossification centers]] and the fusion of epiphyses with the diaphysis.

#### **1. Fetal and Infant Age**
Age is estimated by the appearance of primary ossification centers.

| **Bone/Center** | **Age of Appearance** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calcaneum** | 5th month of Intrauterine Life (IUL) |
| **Talus** | 7th month IUL |
| **Lower end of Femur** | 9th month IUL (At birth) |
| **Upper end of Tibia** | At birth (or shortly after) |
| **Cuboid** | At birth |

> **Medicolegal Significance:** The presence of the ossification center at the lower end of the femur is a medicolegal proof of **viability** (the fetus was capable of independent existence).

#### **2. Childhood and Adolescence (Epiphyseal Appearance & Fusion)**
This is the most active phase for radiological age determination.

**A. Elbow Joint (Ossification Centers Appearance)**
*Mnemonic:* **C-R-I-T-O-E** (Order of appearance: 1-3-5-7-9-11 years)
*   **C**apitulum: 1 year
*   **R**adial Head: 3 years
*   **I**nternal (Medial) Epicondyle: 5 years
*   **T**rochlea: 7 years
*   **O**lecranon: 9 years
*   **E**xternal (Lateral) Epicondyle: 11 years

**B. Wrist (Carpal Bones Appearance)**
*Mnemonic:* **S**he **L**ooks **T**oo **P**retty **T**ry **T**o **C**atch **H**er
*   **C**apitate: 2 months
*   **H**amate: 3 months
*   **T**riquetral: 3 years
*   **L**unate: 4 years
*   **S**caphoid: 5 years
*   **T**rapezium: 5–6 years
*   **T**rapezoid: 5–6 years
*   **P**isiform: 9–12 years

**C. Fusion of Epiphyses (General Guide)**
*   **Elbow joint:** 14–16 years.
*   **Wrist joint:** 18–19 years.
*   **Shoulder joint:** 18–19 years.
*   **Iliac Crest:** Appearance at 14–16 years; Fusion at 18–21 years.
*   **Medial end of Clavicle:** Appearance 18–19 years; Fusion 21–22 years (Last long bone epiphysis to fuse).

#### **3. Adulthood (>25 Years)**
Radiology is less precise after 25 years.
*   **Skull Sutures:** Closure begins endocranially and progresses ectocranially (Sagittal $\rightarrow$ Coronal $\rightarrow$ Lambdoid).
*   **Pubic Symphysis:** Surface changes (Todd’s phases / Suchey-Brooks system).
*   **Sternal Ends of Ribs:** Assessment of pit depth and rim irregularity (Iscan’s method).
*   **Degenerative Changes:** Osteophytes, lipping of vertebrae, and thinning of cortex indicate old age.

### **III. Other Uses of X-ray in Forensics**

1.  **Sex Determination:**
    *   Radiology of the **Pelvis**: Sub-pubic angle (U-shaped/wide in females, V-shaped/narrow in males), Sciatic notch width.
    *   **Skull**: Frontal sinuses and overall ruggedness.
2.  **Stature Estimation:**
    *   Measuring the length of long bones (Femur, Tibia, Humerus) on X-ray and applying regression formulae (e.g., Trotter and Gleser formula).
3.  **Cause of Death/Injury:**
    *   **Battered Baby Syndrome:** X-ray reveals multiple fractures at different stages of healing (callus formation), corner fractures, and metaphyseal chipping.
    *   **Air Embolism:** X-ray of the chest/heart before autopsy to detect air in the right ventricle.
    *   **Pneumothorax:** Diagnosis of collapsed lung.
    *   **Decompression Sickness:** Gas bubbles in joints/tissues.

### **IV. Medicolegal Aspects & Autopsy Findings**

*   **Consent:** Informed written consent is required for X-ray examination of a living person for medicolegal purposes (e.g., age estimation of an accused or victim).
*   **Chain of Custody:** The radiograph must be labeled with the patient's name, date, and institution to be admissible in court.
*   **Autopsy Protocol:** In cases of firearm injuries, explosions, or charred bodies, whole-body X-ray (fluoroscopy) is recommended *before* dissection to locate missiles and avoid damaging them with autopsy instruments.
*   **Benefit of Doubt:** In age estimation, the margin of error (usually ± 1 to 2 years) is always given in favor of the accused/subject.
