# [[Environment And Health]] > Ventilation Standards

### Ventilation Standards

**Ventilation** implies not only the replacement of vitiated air by a supply of fresh outdoor air but also the control of the quality of incoming air (temperature, humidity, and purity). Fixing standards is complex, but they are generally based on the efficiency of removing body heat and odors.

The standards of ventilation are established based on three main criteria:

#### 1. Cubic Space
*   **De Chaumont's Theory (Historical):** Advocated a fresh air supply of [[3000 cubic feet]] (approx. 85 cubic meters) per person per hour.
    *   *Basis:* Ideally, the $CO_2$ due to respiration should not exceed **2 parts in 10,000** (0.02%) above the atmospheric $CO_2$ (0.04%).
    *   *Current Status:* This standard is **no longer followed** rigidly because mere chemical changes ($CO_2$) are not the primary cause of discomfort; physical changes (heat/humidity) are more significant.
*   **Factory Act 1948:** Prescribes a minimum of [[500 cubic feet]] (14.2 cubic meters) of space per worker.
    *   *Note:* Height in excess of **14 feet** (4.2 meters) is not taken into consideration for this calculation, as products of respiration accumulate at lower levels.

#### 2. Air Change
This is considered more important than cubic space. It is defined as the number of times the air in a room is completely replaced by fresh air in one hour.
*   **Living Rooms:** [[2 to 3 air changes]] per hour.
*   **Work Rooms/Assemblies:** [[4 to 6 air changes]] per hour.
*   **Draught Limit:** If air changes exceed **6 times per hour**, it is likely to produce a draught (unpleasant current of air), which should be avoided.

#### 3. Floor Space
This is the **most reliable and practical criterion** because air movement mainly occurs up to 3–4 meters (10–12 feet) above the floor.
*   **Optimum Requirement:** [[50 to 100 sq. ft]] (approx. 5 to 10 sq. meters) per person.

#### Recommended Standards for Specific Settings

| Setting | Recommended Floor Area per Person |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Residential** | **50–100 sq. ft** (approx. 5–9 sq. meters) |
| **General Hospital Ward** | **10 sq. meters** (approx. 100 sq. ft) |
| **Infectious Disease Hospital** | **15 sq. meters** (approx. 150 sq. ft) |
| **Schools** | **10 sq. ft** (approx. 0.8 sq. meters) per student |
| **Factories** (Factor Act 1948) | **500 cu. ft** (14.2 cu. meters) volume |

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a schematic of a room showing air entry and exit. Label 'Living Room: 2-3 changes/hr' and 'Work Room: 4-6 changes/hr'. Indicate the 'Dead Space' above 10-12 feet height.

#### Standards Related to Overcrowding
Ventilation standards are closely linked to the definition of overcrowding.

**A. Persons per Room**
*   1 Room: **2 persons**
*   2 Rooms: **3 persons**
*   3 Rooms: **5 persons**
*   4 Rooms: **7 persons**
*   5+ Rooms: **10 persons** (+2 for each additional room)

**B. Floor Space per Person**
*   110 sq. ft or more: **2 persons**
*   90 – 100 sq. ft: **1.5 persons**
*   70 – 90 sq. ft: **1 person**
*   50 – 70 sq. ft: **0.5 person**
*   Under 50 sq. ft: **0 (Nil)**
*(Note: A baby <12 months is not counted; children 1–10 years count as half a unit).*

### Mnemonic
**"FAB-3"** for Ventilation concepts:
*   **F**loor Space (Most important)
*   **A**ir Change (2-3 for living, 4-6 for work)
*   **C**ubic Space (3000 cu.ft fresh air supply - old concept)

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Respiratory Infections:** Poor ventilation increases the density of droplet nuclei, aiding the spread of [[Tuberculosis]], Influenza, and Measles.
*   **Sick Building Syndrome:** Inadequate ventilation in modern sealed buildings leads to headaches, fatigue, and mucosal irritation.
*   **Thermal Discomfort:** Insufficient air changes lead to heat stagnation (rise in temperature and humidity), causing discomfort and reduced efficiency.
