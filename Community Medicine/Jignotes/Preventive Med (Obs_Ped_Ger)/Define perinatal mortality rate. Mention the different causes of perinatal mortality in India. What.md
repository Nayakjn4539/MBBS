# [[PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IN OBSTETRICS, PAEDIATRICS AND GERIATRICS]] > Define perinatal mortality rate. Mention the different causes of perinatal mortality in India. What are the goals of India Newborn Action Plan (INAP)?

### Perinatal Mortality Rate (PMR)

**Definition:**
Perinatal mortality refers to fetal and early neonatal deaths. It is considered a sensitive index of the quality of **[[obstetric care]]** and **[[neonatal care]]**.

**Criteria:**
The perinatal period officially commences at **28 completed weeks of gestation** (late fetal phase) and ends on the **7th completed day of life** (early neonatal phase).
*(Note: For international comparisons, WHO defines the perinatal period as commencing at 22 weeks of gestation or 500g birth weight).*

**Formula:**
$$ \text{PMR} = \frac{\text{Late Fetal Deaths (28 wks+)} + \text{Early Neonatal Deaths (<7 days)}}{\text{Total Live Births}} \times 1000 $$

> *Note: Some definitions use "Total Births" (Live + Stillbirths) in the denominator to be mathematically precise.*

**Current Status:**
*   **PMR in India (SRS 2020):** 18 per 1000 births.

### Causes of Perinatal Mortality in India

The causes are often multifactorial, involving maternal health, labor management, and newborn care.

#### 1. Antenatal Causes (Maternal & Fetal)
*   **Maternal Diseases:** Hypertension (PIH), **[[Diabetes Mellitus]]**, severe **[[Anemia]]**, Tuberculosis, Cardiac diseases.
*   **Obstetric Complications:** **[[Antepartum Hemorrhage]]** (Abruptio placentae, Placenta previa), Toxemias of pregnancy.
*   **Placental/Cord Causes:** Placental insufficiency, cord prolapse, cord around the neck.
*   **Fetal Causes:** **[[Congenital anomalies]]**, Rh Incompatibility, Multiple gestation (Twins).

#### 2. Intranatal Causes (During Delivery)
*   **[[Birth Asphyxia]]** (Hypoxia): A leading cause of fresh stillbirths and early neonatal deaths.
*   **Birth Trauma:** Injuries during difficult labor or instrumental delivery.
*   **Prolonged/Obstructed Labor:** Leading to fetal distress.

#### 3. Postnatal Causes (Early Neonatal)
*   **[[Prematurity]]** and **[[Low Birth Weight]]** (<2.5 kg): The most significant contributors.
*   **Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS):** Common in preterm infants.
*   **Infections:** Neonatal **[[Sepsis]]**, Tetanus neonatorum.

#### 4. Social and Environmental Factors
*   Low socio-economic status.
*   **[[Maternal Age]]**: <19 years (teenage pregnancy) or >35 years (elderly primi).
*   **Parity**: High parity (5th child onwards) or short birth intervals.
*   Lack of antenatal care and untrained birth attendants.

### Mnemonic for Causes: "P-E-R-I-N-A-T-A-L"
*   **P**rematurity / **P**lacement (Placenta previa)
*   **E**arly Infection (Sepsis)
*   **R**espiratory Distress
*   **I**njury (Birth trauma)
*   **N**utrition (Maternal Malnutrition/Anemia)
*   **A**sphyxia
*   **T**oxemias of Pregnancy (Eclampsia)
*   **A**nomalies (Congenital)
*   **L**ow Birth Weight

### India Newborn Action Plan (INAP)

Launched in **June 2014**, INAP is a targeted strategy to prevent newborn deaths and stillbirths. It is implemented under the framework of **[[RMNCH+A]]** (Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child, and Adolescent Health).

#### **Strategic Goals**
The primary vision is "End Preventable Newborn Deaths". The specific quantitative goals are:

1.  **Single Digit Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR):** Achieve an NMR of less than **10 per 1000 live births** by the year **2030**.
2.  **Single Digit Stillbirth Rate (SBR):** Achieve an SBR of less than **10 per 1000 total births** by the year **2030**.

#### **Strategic Intervention Packages (The 6 Pillars)**
INAP focuses on interventions across the life-cycle continuum:
1.  **Pre-conception and Antenatal Care:** Nutrition, Tetanus toxoid, screening for high-risk pregnancies.
2.  **Care during Labor and Childbirth:** Skilled attendance, clean delivery practices.
3.  **Immediate Newborn Care:** Delayed cord clamping, prevention of hypothermia, early initiation of breastfeeding.
4.  **Care of Healthy Newborn:** Home-based newborn care (HBNC) by **[[ASHA]]**.
5.  **Care of Small and Sick Newborn:** KMC (**[[Kangaroo Mother Care]]**), SNCUs (Special Newborn Care Units).
6.  **Care beyond Newborn Survival:** Screening for defects/delays (**[[RBSK]]**).

**Clinical Relevance:**
High Perinatal Mortality is a "wastage of reproduction" and reflects poor obstetric services. Achieving INAP goals requires strengthening the **[[Cold Chain]]**, promoting institutional deliveries (**[[Janani Suraksha Yojana]]**), and effective management of asphyxia and sepsis.
