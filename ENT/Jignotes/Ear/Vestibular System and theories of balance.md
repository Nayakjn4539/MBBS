# Vestibular System and Theories of Balance

The [[Vestibular System]] is a complex sensory system responsible for maintaining equilibrium, coordinating head and eye movements, and providing a sense of spatial orientation. It consists of a peripheral apparatus located in the inner ear and central connections in the brainstem and cerebellum.

## 1. Anatomy of the Peripheral Vestibular System

The peripheral system is housed within the [[Petrous Temporal Bone]]. It consists of the **Bony Labyrinth** (filled with [[Perilymph]]) and the **Membranous Labyrinth** (filled with [[Endolymph]]).

### A. The Labyrinthine Components

| Structure | Component | Function | Sensory Receptor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Semicircular Canals (SCC)** | Dynamic Labyrinth | Detects **Angular/Rotational** Acceleration | [[Crista Ampullaris]] (in Ampulla) |
| **Otolith Organs** ([[Utricle]] & [[Saccule]]) | Static Labyrinth | Detects **Linear** Acceleration & Gravity (Head Tilt) | [[Macula]] |

### B. Semicircular Canals (SCC)
There are three canals oriented at right angles (orthogonal) to each other:
1.  **Lateral (Horizontal) Canal:** Oriented 30° upwards from the horizontal plane.
2.  **Posterior (Vertical) Canal:** Parallel to the posterior petrous surface.
3.  **Superior (Anterior) Canal:** Transverse to the long axis of the petrous bone.

*   **Ampulla:** A dilation at one end of each canal containing the sensory organ, the **Crista**.
*   **Cupula:** A gelatinous mass overlying the crista that extends to the roof of the ampulla. It acts as a swing door; movement of endolymph displaces the cupula, bending the hair cells.

### C. Otolith Organs (Utricle and Saccule)
*   **Utricle:** Located in the elliptical recess. The **Macula** is oriented horizontally. Sensitive to horizontal linear acceleration (e.g., car moving) and head tilt.
*   **Saccule:** Located in the spherical recess. The **Macula** is oriented vertically. Sensitive to vertical linear acceleration (e.g., elevator) and gravity.
*   **Otoconia:** Calcium carbonate crystals located on top of the gelatinous membrane of the macula. Their mass causes the membrane to lag during movement due to inertia, bending the hair cells.
*   **Striola:** A central curved line dividing the macula. Hair cell orientation reverses across this line.

### D. Innervation
The [[Vestibular Nerve]] (CN VIII) branches into:
*   **Superior Vestibular Nerve:** Supplies the [[Utricle]], [[Superior Semicircular Canal]], and [[Lateral Semicircular Canal]].
*   **Inferior Vestibular Nerve:** Supplies the [[Saccule]] and [[Posterior Semicircular Canal]] (via the Singular Nerve).
*   **Ganglion:** [[Scarpa's Ganglion]] located in the lateral part of the [[Internal Acoustic Meatus]].

## 2. Physiology of Balance: Mechanisms and Theories

Balance is maintained by the integration of inputs from three systems: **Visual**, **Proprioceptive**, and **Vestibular**.

### A. Transduction by Hair Cells
The vestibular hair cells (Type I and Type II) are the mechanoreceptors.
*   **Structure:** Each cell has multiple **Stereocilia** and one large **Kinocilium**.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   Deflection of stereocilia **Towards** the Kinocilium $\rightarrow$ Depolarization (Excitation/Increased firing rate).
    *   Deflection of stereocilia **Away** from the Kinocilium $\rightarrow$ Hyperpolarization (Inhibition/Decreased firing rate).

### B. Physiology of Semicircular Canals (Angular Acceleration)
When the head rotates, the bony canal moves, but the endolymph lags behind due to **inertia**. This relative flow of fluid deflects the cupula.

**Ewald's Laws of Vestibular Function:**
1.  **First Law:** The axis of [[Nystagmus]] matches the anatomic axis of the semicircular canal that is stimulated.
2.  **Second Law (Horizontal Canal):** **Ampullopetal** flow (endolymph flow *towards* the ampulla) causes a greater response (excitation) than ampullofugal flow (away from ampulla).
3.  **Third Law (Vertical Canals):** **Ampullofugal** flow (endolymph flow *away* from the ampulla) causes a greater response (excitation) than ampullopetal flow.

### C. Push-Pull Mechanism
The vestibular system works in pairs.
*   Right Horizontal SCC works with Left Horizontal SCC.
*   Right Superior SCC works with Left Posterior SCC (RALP).
*   Right Posterior SCC works with Left Superior SCC (LARP).

**Example (Turning head to the Right):**
*   Right Horizontal SCC: Endolymph moves towards ampulla (Ampullopetal) $\rightarrow$ **Excitation**.
*   Left Horizontal SCC: Endolymph moves away from ampulla (Ampullofugal) $\rightarrow$ **Inhibition**.
*   The brain interprets this disparity in firing rates as rotation to the right.

### D. Vestibular Reflexes
1.  **Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR):**
    *   **Purpose:** Stabilizes gaze during head movement (keeps image on the fovea).
    *   **Mechanism:** Head rotation to the *left* causes eyes to move to the *right* with equal velocity.
    *   **Pathology:** Loss of VOR leads to [[Oscillopsia]] (bouncing vision).
2.  **Vestibulospinal Reflex (VSR):**
    *   **Purpose:** Maintains posture and center of gravity against gravity.
    *   **Mechanism:** Input from otoliths/canals travels via vestibulospinal tracts to skeletal muscles (extensors) to prevent falling.
3.  **Vestibulocollic Reflex (VCR):**
    *   **Purpose:** Stabilizes the head in space.
    *   **Mechanism:** Acts on neck muscles (tested clinically via [[VEMP]]).

## 3. Clinical Assessment of the Vestibular System

### A. Nystagmus
Involuntary rhythmic oscillation of the eyes.
*   **Phases:** Slow phase (vestibular component) and Fast phase (central corrective component).
*   **Naming:** Named by the direction of the **Fast Phase**.
*   **Alexander's Law:** Nystagmus intensity increases when looking in the direction of the fast phase.

**Differentiation of Nystagmus:**
| Feature | Peripheral (Inner Ear) | Central (Brainstem/Cerebellum) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Direction** | Fixed (usually horizontal-torsional) | Variable (Direction changing) |
| **Fixation** | Suppressed by visual fixation | Not suppressed (may enhance) |
| **Fatigability** | Fatigable | Non-fatigable |
| **Latency** | Present | Absent |
| **Vertigo** | Severe | Mild/Absent |

### B. Clinical Tests

**1. Fistula Test**
*   **Method:** Intermittent pressure applied to tragus or via Siegel’s speculum.
*   **Positive:** Induces vertigo and nystagmus.
*   **Indication:** Labyrinthine fistula (e.g., Cholesteatoma erosion of Lateral SCC).
*   **Hennebert’s Sign:** False positive fistula test (no fistula present). Seen in [[Congenital Syphilis]] or [[Ménière's Disease]] (fibrous bands between stapes and utricle).
*   **Tullio Phenomenon:** Vertigo/Nystagmus induced by loud sound (seen in [[Superior Canal Dehiscence]]).

**2. Romberg Test**
*   **Method:** Standing feet together, eyes closed.
*   **Interpretation:** Falling to the side of the lesion indicates uncompensated peripheral lesion. (Note: Classical Romberg tests dorsal column/proprioception).
*   **Sharpened Romberg:** Tandem standing (heel-to-toe). More sensitive.

**3. Unterberger’s Stepping Test**
*   Patient marches in place with eyes closed.
*   Rotation >45° towards the side of the lesion indicates peripheral vestibular dysfunction.

**4. Dix-Hallpike Maneuver**
*   **Gold Standard** for diagnosing [[Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo]] (BPPV).
*   **Method:** Patient from sitting to supine with head hanging 30° and turned 45°.
*   **Positive:** Latency (2-20s), Rotatory geotropic nystagmus, fatiguable. Diagnostic of **Posterior Canal BPPV**.

**5. Head Impulse Test (HIT)**
*   Tests the high-frequency VOR.
*   Patient fixes gaze on examiner's nose while head is rapidly turned.
*   **Abnormal:** Corrective "catch-up" saccade by eyes indicates peripheral lesion on the side of the turn.

### C. Laboratory Tests

**1. Caloric Test (Fitzgerald-Hallpike)**
*   Tests the **Lateral Semicircular Canal** (at low frequency).
*   **Method:** Water at 30°C and 44°C irrigated into ear (7° below and above body temp).
*   **Mnemonic COWS:**
    *   **C**old water $\rightarrow$ Nystagmus to **O**pposite side.
    *   **W**arm water $\rightarrow$ Nystagmus to **S**ame side.
*   **Findings:**
    *   **Canal Paresis:** Reduced response on one side (e.g., Acoustic Neuroma).
    *   **Directional Preponderance:** Nystagmus duration is longer in one direction (e.g., Central lesion).

**2. Electronystagmography (ENG) / Videonystagmography (VNG)**
*   Records eye movements using corneoretinal potential or infrared cameras.
*   Objective assessment of oculomotor and vestibular function.

**3. Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials (VEMP)**
*   **cVEMP:** Tests **Saccule** and **Inferior Vestibular Nerve**. Recorded from SCM muscle (inhibitory response).
*   **oVEMP:** Tests **Utricle** and **Superior Vestibular Nerve**. Recorded from inferior oblique muscle (excitatory response).
*   **Clinical Use:** Superior Canal Dehiscence (low threshold), Vestibular Schwannoma.

**4. Posturography**
*   Computerized Dynamic Posturography (CDP) assesses the contribution of Vision, Proprioception, and Vestibular inputs to balance.
