### Road Traffic Accident (RTA) Injuries

Road traffic accidents involve complex mechanisms of injury depending on the victim's role (pedestrian, driver, passenger, or cyclist) and the nature of the collision.

---

### I. Pedestrian Injuries
Pedestrians form the largest group of victims in developing countries. Injuries occur in three distinct phases:

#### 1. Primary Impact Injuries
*   **Definition:** Injuries caused by the **first contact** between the vehicle and the pedestrian.
*   **Location:** Usually on the lower limbs (bumper) or hips/buttocks (mudguard/bonnet), depending on the vehicle height and victim's center of gravity.
*   **[[Bumper Fracture]]:**
    *   Usually a triangular fracture of the **tibia and fibula**.
    *   The apex of the triangular fragment points in the direction the vehicle was moving.
    *   **Measurement:** The height of the fracture from the heel is crucial to identify the offending vehicle (correlates with bumper height).
    *   **Braking Effect:** If the driver brakes, the front of the car dips, causing fractures at a *lower* level than the standing bumper height.

#### 2. Secondary Impact Injuries
*   **Definition:** Injuries caused when the pedestrian is thrown onto the vehicle (bonnet, windscreen, or roof) after the primary impact.
*   **Mechanism:** The pedestrian is usually "scooped up" if the impact is below the center of gravity.
*   **Findings:**
    *   Injuries to the head, face, chest, or abdomen.
    *   **[[Sparrow Foot Marks]]:** Multiple small, angulated lacerated wounds on the face caused by shattering of the windscreen glass (tempered glass).
    *   Patterned abrasions from radiator grilles or headlamps.

#### 3. Secondary Injuries (Tertiary Impact)
*   **Definition:** Injuries sustained when the victim falls to the ground after being thrown off the vehicle.
*   **Findings:**
    *   **Head Injuries:** Usually **[[Contre-coup]]** injuries (brain injury opposite to the side of impact) are common due to the fall on the road.
    *   Extensive abrasions (graze) and lacerations on the non-impact side.
    *   **Dirty/Grease collar** abrasions may be seen if run over.

#### 4. Run-Over Injuries
*   Occur when the wheel passes over the body.
*   **Tyre marks:** Patterned abrasions or intradermal bruises reflecting the tread design (helps identify vehicle).
*   **Flaying/Degloving:** Rotary force of the wheel can detach skin and subcutaneous tissue from underlying muscle.
*   **Internal Crushing:** Massive organ rupture (liver, spleen) and comminuted fractures with relatively minimal external signs (due to tissue elasticity).
*   **Tarding:** Eversion of the pockets due to the pressure wave of the tire passing over the legs/abdomen.

### II. Injuries to Vehicle Occupants

#### 1. The Driver
*   **Mechanism:** Violent deceleration causes the body to move forward while the vehicle stops.
*   **Specific Injuries:**
    *   **[[Steering Wheel Impact]]:**
        *   **Patterned bruising** on the chest.
        *   Fracture of the sternum.
        *   **Flail chest** (multiple rib fractures).
        *   **Cardiac Contusion** or rupture.
        *   **Traumatic Aortic Rupture:** Typically occurs at the **isthmus** (junction of arch and descending aorta) due to shearing forces.
    *   **Face/Neck:** Lacerations from windscreen; fracture of larynx/trachea against the steering rim.
    *   **Legs/Hips:**
        *   **[[Dashboard Injury]]:** Impact of the knee against the dashboard is transmitted up the femur.
        *   Causes **Posterior Dislocation of the Hip** (Acetabular fracture) or fracture of the patella/femur.
        *   **Fracture-dislocation of ankle/foot:** Due to entrapment in pedals.

#### 2. Front Seat Passenger
*   Similar to the driver but **lacks steering wheel injuries**.
*   **Dashboard Injuries:** Severe head and face injuries from hitting the dashboard/windscreen (also called "Guest Passenger" injuries).
*   **Ejection:** If unrestrained, occupants may be ejected through the windscreen or doors, leading to severe polytrauma and higher mortality.

#### 3. Restraint System Injuries
While safety devices reduce mortality, they cause specific injury patterns:
*   **[[Seat Belt Syndrome]]:**
    *   Abrasions/bruises over the clavicle, chest, and abdomen (strap marks).
    *   **Mesenteric tears** and bowel rupture.
    *   **[[Chance Fracture]]:** Horizontal distraction fracture of the lumbar vertebrae (usually L1-L3) due to hyperflexion over the lap belt.
*   **Airbags:**
    *   Facial abrasions, corneal abrasions, chemical keratitis (sodium azide gas), and spectacles-related injuries.

#### 4. Whiplash Injury
*   **Mechanism:** Sudden acceleration (rear-end collision) or deceleration (front-end collision).
*   **Motion:** The body moves with the seat, but the unsupported head lags behind (**Hyperextension**) followed by a recoil (**Hyperflexion**).
*   **Pathology:**
    *   Tear of anterior longitudinal ligaments.
    *   Avulsion fracture of anterior parts of cervical vertebrae.
    *   Spinal cord contusion/hemorrhage without bony fracture.
    *   Most common at **C5-C7** junction.

**Mnemonic for Whiplash Symptoms: WAD**
*   **W**eakness
*   **A**ltered sensation
*   **D**ecreased range of motion

### III. Motorcyclist and Cyclist Injuries
*   **Nature:** High velocity and lack of protection lead to severe injuries.
*   **Primary/Secondary Impacts:** Similar to pedestrians but with greater momentum.
*   **Specific Injuries:**
    *   **Head Injuries:** Skull fractures (ring fracture around foramen magnum), diffuse axonal injury.
    *   **Handlebar Injuries:** Blunt trauma to the upper abdomen causing liver/spleen rupture or pancreatic injury.
    *   **Tail-gating:** When a bike hits the back of a truck, the rider may be decapitated or sustain severe upper body shearing injuries.
    *   **Spokes Injuries:** Heel/foot caught in spokes (common in pillion riders).
*   **Identification Feature:** In motorcyclists, the **inner aspect of thighs** and **popliteal fossae** are usually spared from injury (unless run over), unlike pedestrians.

### IV. Medicolegal Aspects & Autopsy Findings

#### Objectives of Autopsy
1.  Determine the **cause of death** (e.g., hemorrhage, head injury, shock).
2.  Determine the **time of death**.
3.  Reconstruct the accident (direction, position of victim, speed).
4.  Identify the vehicle (paint, grease, tyre marks).
5.  Determine the state of sobriety (Alcohol/Drugs).

#### External Examination
*   **Clothes:** Examine for paint flakes, grease, tyre marks, and glass fragments. Note direction of tears.
*   **Paint samples:** Collect transferred paint from clothing/wounds for chemical analysis.
*   **Trace Evidence:** Hair, blood, or tissue found on the vehicle must be matched with the victim.
*   **Grease stains:** Suggest the undercarriage of the vehicle.

#### Internal Examination
*   **Cranial:** Look for coup and contrecoup lesions.
*   **Thoracic:** Check for aortic rupture (isthmus), cardiac tamponade, and flail chest.
*   **Abdominal:** Liver and spleen ruptures are common. Retroperitoneal hematoma.
*   **Skeletal:** Dissect legs to find bumper fractures (measure height from heel).

#### Toxicology
*   **Samples:** Blood (from femoral vein), Urine, and Vitreous humor.
*   **Purpose:** To test for **[[Alcohol]]** (ethanol), carbon monoxide (if fire involved), and drugs of abuse.
*   **Note:** In survival periods >24 hours, alcohol levels may not reflect the state at the time of the accident.

#### Identification
*   If the body is mutilated or unrecognizable (e.g., intense fire or run-over), use **[[DNA fingerprinting]]**, dental records, or osteology.

#### Differentiating Driver vs. Passenger
| Feature | Driver | Passenger |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Steering wheel marks** | Present on chest | Absent |
| **Pedal marks** | Present on soles of shoes | Absent |
| **Fractures** | Right leg/ankle (braking) | Left leg/knees (dashboard) |
| **Dicing injuries** | Right side of face/arm (driver's window) | Left side of face/arm |
*(Note: Sides reversed for Left-hand drive countries)*
