# [[Autopsy]] > Autopsy Techniques

### **Autopsy Techniques**

**[[Medicolegal Autopsy]]** involves systematic examination of a dead body for medical, legal, and scientific purposes. The procedure generally consists of external examination, making incisions, evisceration (removal of organs), dissection, and reconstruction.

### **I. Primary Skin Incisions**

The choice of incision depends on the case type, age of the deceased, and cosmetic requirements.

| Type of Incision | Description & Indication |
| :--- | :--- |
| **I-Shaped (Midline)** | • **Most common** method.<br>• Extends from the chin (or thyroid cartilage) straight down to the [[symphysis pubis]], passing to the left of the umbilicus.<br>• **Advantage:** Quick, exposes all cavities.<br>• **Note:** Umbilicus is avoided as it is dense fibrous tissue and difficult to suture later. |
| **Y-Shaped** | • Incisions start from both acromion processes, meet at the xiphisternum, and continue down to the symphysis pubis.<br>• **Indication:** Preferred in females to avoid scars on the breasts (cosmetic reasons). |
| **Modified Y-Shaped** | • Incisions start from the mastoid processes (behind ears), extend down the neck to meet at the suprasternal notch, then continue down to the pubis.<br>• **Indication:** Used when detailed neck dissection is required (e.g., [[hanging]], [[strangulation]]). |
| **Inverted Y-Shaped** | • Starts from the chin/neck down to the umbilicus, then bifurcates to both ankles/thighs.<br>• **Indication:** Exclusively used for **newborns/infants** to examine umbilical vessels and femoral arteries. |
| **T-Shaped** | • A horizontal incision from shoulder to shoulder and a vertical line down the sternum.<br>• **Indication:** Rarely used; mainly for cosmetic autopsy. |

### **II. Methods of Evisceration (Removal of Organs)**

There are four primary techniques for removing internal organs.

#### **1. Virchow’s Technique (Organ by Organ)**
*   **Method:** Organs are removed one by one and examined separately.
*   **Procedure:** Cranial cavity is opened first, followed by thoracic, cervical, and abdominal organs.
*   **Advantage:** Most widely used; easy to perform; good for beginners.
*   **Disadvantage:** Anatomical relationships between organs are destroyed (not suitable for complex multiple injuries or gunshot tracks).

#### **2. Rokitansky’s Technique (In Situ)**
*   **Method:** Organs are dissected and examined inside the body **without removal**.
*   **Procedure:** Dissection is done in part, combined with en bloc removal if needed.
*   **Indication:** Preferred in highly infectious cases (e.g., **[[HIV]]**, **Hepatitis B**, CJD) to minimize contamination of the autopsy room; also used if permission is restricted (partial autopsy).
*   **Disadvantage:** Thorough examination of posterior organ surfaces is difficult.

#### **3. Ghon’s Technique (En Bloc)**
*   **Method:** Organs are removed in functionally related blocks (groups).
*   **Blocks:**
    1.  **Cervical and Thoracic:** Neck organs, heart, lungs.
    2.  **Abdominal:** Liver, spleen, stomach, intestines.
    3.  **Urogenital:** Kidneys, ureters, bladder, genitalia.
*   **Advantage:** Preserves inter-organ relationships within the block.

#### **4. Letulle’s Technique (En Masse)**
*   **Method:** **Evisceration en masse**. All viscera (thoracic, cervical, abdominal, pelvic) are removed together as one single mass from the tongue to the anus.
*   **Advantage:** Best method for preserving anatomical relationships between all organs; ideal for gunshot wounds and stab wounds crossing multiple cavities.
*   **Disadvantage:** Heavy and difficult to handle alone; requires an assistant.

**Mnemonic to Remember Techniques:**
*   **V**irchow = **V**ery distinct (One by one)
*   **G**hon = **G**roups (En bloc)
*   **L**etulle = **L**ot (All together/En Masse)
*   **R**okitansky = **R**estricted removal (In situ)

### **III. Specific Dissection Techniques**

#### **A. Skull and Brain**
*   **Incision:** Coronal incision on the scalp (from mastoid to mastoid over the vertex).
*   **Opening:** Skull cap (calvarium) is removed using a saw. The saw line is usually **V-shaped** (120°) or stepped to ensure the skull cap fits back securely without slipping during reconstruction.
*   **Brain Removal:** Dura is cut; frontal lobes are gently lifted; cranial nerves and vessels are cut; tentorium cerebelli is incised; finally, the spinal cord is cut at the foramen magnum.
*   **Brain Sectioning:**
    *   **Fresh Brain:** Coronal sections (1 cm apart).
    *   **Fixed Brain:** Fixed in 10% [[formalin]] for 2-3 weeks (suspension method) before sectioning. Recommended for detailed pathology.

#### **B. Neck Dissection (Bloodless Field)**
*   **Crucial in:** [[Asphyxial deaths]] (hanging, strangulation) to differentiate antemortem bruising from postmortem artifacts.
*   **Technique:**
    1.  Open the skull and remove the brain first (drains blood from head).
    2.  Open thorax and abdomen and remove organs (drains blood from major vessels).
    3.  **Finally**, dissect the neck. This creates a "bloodless field" ensuring any hemorrhage found in neck muscles is a true antemortem injury (vital reaction) and not a flow artifact.
*   **[[Prinsloo Gordon Artifact]]:** Avoid confusing this postmortem hypostasis behind the esophagus with antemortem bruising.

#### **C. Heart Dissection**
*   **Inflow-Outflow Method:** Follows the direction of blood flow.
    *   Right Atrium $\rightarrow$ Right Ventricle $\rightarrow$ Pulmonary Artery.
    *   Left Atrium $\rightarrow$ Left Ventricle $\rightarrow$ Aorta.
*   **Ventricular Slicing (Bread Loafing):** Transverse cuts across ventricles. Useful for detecting [[myocardial infarction]] and fibrosis.

#### **D. Spinal Cord Removal**
*   **Posterior Approach:** Body is placed prone. An incision is made along the spinous processes. Laminae are sawed off to expose the cord.
*   **Anterior Approach:** Done after removing all thoracic and abdominal organs. Vertebral bodies are sawed to expose the cord.

### **IV. Special Autopsy Procedures**

| Procedure | Purpose | Technique |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Demonstration of [[Pneumothorax]]** | Detect air in pleural cavity | Before opening chest, create a pocket of water between skin and ribs. Puncture intercostal space underwater. Bubbles indicate pneumothorax. |
| **Demonstration of [[Air Embolism]]** | Detect air in heart | Open pericardium. Fill pericardial sac with water. Puncture right ventricle underwater. Bubbles indicate air embolism. |
| **[[Virtual Autopsy]] (Virtopsy)** | Non-invasive examination | Uses CT, MRI, and 3D surface scanning to document injuries and pathology without opening the body. Useful when religious objections exist. |
| **Psychological Autopsy** | Determine mode of death | Retrospective investigation of victim's mental state (interviews, notes) to distinguish suicide from accident/homicide. |

### **V. Post-Autopsy Reconstruction**
*   Organs not retained for analysis are placed in a bag and returned to the body cavity.
*   Breastbone and skull cap are replaced.
*   Incisions are sutured (usually using the "baseball stitch" for tight closure).
*   Body is washed and prepared for handover.

---

### **VI. Medicolegal Aspects**
*   **Inquest Report:** The doctor must read the inquest report before starting to know the alleged cause of death.
*   **Chain of Custody:** Essential for all samples collected (viscera, blood, clothes).
*   **Viscera Preservation:**
    *   **Routine:** Saline or Rectified Spirit (avoid spirit in alcohol/phosphorus/acetic acid poisoning).
    *   **Ideal:** Saturated solution of **Sodium Chloride (Common Salt)**.
*   **Negative Autopsy:** When gross and microscopic examination, toxicological analysis, and laboratory tests fail to reveal the cause of death (occurs in 2-5% cases).
