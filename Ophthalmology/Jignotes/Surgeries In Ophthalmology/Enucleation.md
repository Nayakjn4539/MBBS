# [[Surgeries In Ophthalmology]] > Enucleation

# Enumerate: Enucleation of the Eyeball

### Definition
**Enucleation** is the surgical removal of the entire [[eyeball]] (globe) along with a portion of the [[optic nerve]], while leaving the [[extraocular muscles]] and the remaining orbital contents (Tenon's capsule, orbital fat) intact.

### Indications
Enucleation is indicated when the eye is irreparable, painful, or poses a threat to the patient's life or the health of the other eye.

| Category | Conditions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Absolute Indications** | 1. **Intraocular Malignancies:** [[Retinoblastoma]] and [[Malignant Melanoma]]. <br> 2. **Eye Donation:** Removal of eyes from a cadaver. |
| **Relative Indications** | 1. **Painful Blind Eye:** e.g., [[Absolute Glaucoma]], [[Neovascular Glaucoma]]. <br> 2. **Severe Trauma:** Mutilating ocular injury where the globe cannot be salvaged. <br> 3. **Prevention of [[Sympathetic Ophthalmitis]]:** In severe penetrating trauma. <br> 4. **[[Phthisis Bulbi]]:** Atrophic, shrunken globe. <br> 5. **[[Anterior Staphyloma]]:** Severe cases. <br> 6. **[[Endophthalmitis]]/[[Panophthalmitis]]:** Only if there is a risk of intracranial spread or if the eye is destroyed (though [[evisceration]] is often preferred to avoid meningitis spread via the optic nerve sheath). |

### Surgical Instruments
The following specific instruments are essential for performing an enucleation:

#### 1. Eye Speculum
*   **Type:** [[Universal Metallic Eye Speculum]] or Wire Speculum.
*   **Function:** Used to retract the eyelids and keep the palpebral aperture open to provide exposure to the surgical field.
*   **Mechanism:** It has a spring mechanism with a screw to adjust the width of the limb separation.

#### 2. Scalpel Handle (Bard-Parker Handle)
*   **Type:** Usually #3 handle with a #11 or #15 blade.
*   **Function:** Sometimes used for the initial incision at the [[limbus]] to separate the conjunctiva (peritomy), though scissors are more commonly used for this step in enucleation.

#### 3. Conjunctival Scissors
*   **Type:** Plain curved scissors (ringed) or Spring scissors (Westcott’s).
*   **Function:**
    *   To perform **peritomy**: Incising the [[conjunctiva]] 360 degrees around the limbus.
    *   To undermine the conjunctiva and [[Tenon's capsule]] to expose the extraocular muscles.

#### 4. Strabismus Hook (Muscle Hook)
*   **Appearance:** A flat metal handle with a blunt, knobbed hook at the end.
*   **Function:** Used to engage and isolate the [[extraocular muscles]] (recti) before they are severed from the sclera.

#### 5. Plain Dissecting Forceps
*   **Function:** Used to hold the conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule during dissection. It aids in lifting the tissues to allow scissors to undermine them.

#### 6. Artery Forceps (Haemostatic Forceps)
*   **Type:** Small mosquito artery forceps (curved or straight).
*   **Function:**
    *   To clamp bleeding vessels to achieve haemostasis.
    *   To hold the stumps of the rectus muscles (traction sutures may be tagged with these).
    *   To hold gauze packs for compression hemostasis in the socket after the globe is removed.

#### 7. Needle Holder
*   **Type:** [[Silcock's needle holder]] or [[Castroviejo's needle holder]].
*   **Function:** Used for passing sutures through the muscle stumps (if an implant is used) and for closing the Tenon's capsule and conjunctiva at the end of the surgery.

#### *Specialized Instrument: Enucleation Scissors*
*   **Description:** Large, stout scissors with curved blades and blunt tips.
*   **Function:** Specifically designed to be introduced deep into the orbit to cut the [[optic nerve]].

### Surgical Technique (Steps)

**Anaesthesia:** Usually General Anaesthesia (children/painful eyes) or Local Anaesthesia ([[Retrobulbar block]] + Facial block) in adults.

**1. Exposure and Peritomy**
*   Lids are separated using the **Eye Speculum**.
*   The **Conjunctival Scissors** are used to incise the conjunctiva 360 degrees around the limbus (peritomy).
*   Tenon's capsule is undermined to expose the muscle insertions.

**2. Isolation and Division of Muscles**
*   The **Strabismus Hook** is passed under each rectus muscle (Superior, Inferior, Medial, Lateral).
*   The muscles are secured (often with sutures held by **Needle Holders** if an implant is planned) and cut close to the globe using scissors.
*   **Clinical Implication:** It is crucial to identify and separate the oblique muscles (Superior and Inferior Obliques) and cut them as well.

**3. Division of the Optic Nerve**
*   The globe is prolapsed forward.
*   **Enucleation Scissors** are introduced from the medial side. The [[optic nerve]] is felt as a taut cord.
*   The nerve is cut.
    *   *Note on Retinoblastoma:* A long stump of the optic nerve (>10mm) must be excised to ensure complete removal of the tumor. An **Optic Nerve Guide (Enucleation Spoon)** may be used to engage the nerve and protect surrounding tissues.

**4. Removal and Haemostasis**
*   The eyeball is removed.
*   Socket is packed with hot, moist gauze held by **Artery Forceps** to control bleeding from the [[ophthalmic artery]] branches.

**5. Implant Insertion and Closure**
*   An orbital implant (e.g., [[Hydroxyapatite]], PMMA) is inserted into the muscle cone to maintain orbital volume and motility.
*   **Needle Holder** is used to suture the rectus muscles over the implant (or to each other).
*   Tenon's capsule and conjunctiva are sutured in separate layers.

### Post-Operative Care & Rehabilitation
*   **Pressure Bandage:** Applied for 24-48 hours to reduce edema and prevent hematoma.
*   **Medication:** Systemic antibiotics and analgesics.
*   **Prosthesis:** A conformer is placed initially to maintain the fornices. A permanent **Artificial Eye (Prosthesis)** is fitted after approximately 6 weeks when edema has subsided.

### Complications
*   **Hemorrhage:** Retrobulbar hemorrhage during surgery.
*   **Infection:** Orbital cellulitis or socket infection.
*   **Socket Issues:** [[Contracted socket]] (if conformer/prosthesis is delayed), ptosis, or implant extrusion.
