# [[Affections Of Soft Tissues]] > Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

# Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS)

### Definition
[[Carpal Tunnel Syndrome]] is a clinical condition characterized by the compression of the [[Median Nerve]] as it passes deep to the [[Flexor Retinaculum]] (transverse carpal ligament) at the wrist. It is the most common and best-known [[Entrapment Neuropathy]] of the upper limb.

### Surgical Anatomy
The [[Carpal Tunnel]] is a fibro-osseous tunnel situated at the wrist.
*   **Boundaries:**
    *   **Roof:** [[Flexor Retinaculum]] (Transverse Carpal Ligament).
    *   **Floor and Sides:** Carpal bones (Scaphoid, Lunate, Triquetrum, Pisiform, Trapezium, Trapezoid, Capitate, Hamate).
*   **Contents (Total 10 structures):**
    *   **Nerve:** [[Median Nerve]] (1).
    *   **Tendons:** [[Flexor Digitorum Superficialis]] (4 tendons), [[Flexor Digitorum Profundus]] (4 tendons), and [[Flexor Pollicis Longus]] (1 tendon).

### Etiology
Any condition that decreases the size of the tunnel or increases the volume of its contents can cause CTS.

**Mnemonic: PRAGMATIC**
| Letter | Cause | Examples/Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P** | Pregnancy | Due to fluid retention (edema). |
| **R** | [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]] | Inflammatory synovitis (tenosynovitis) increases volume. |
| **A** | Arthritis (Degenerative) | Osteophytes from carpal bones crowding the space. |
| **G** | Growth Hormone abnormalities | [[Acromegaly]] causes soft tissue and bone hypertrophy. |
| **M** | Metabolic | [[Gout]], [[Diabetes Mellitus]], [[Myxoedema]] (Hypothyroidism). |
| **A** | Alcoholism | Associated neuropathy. |
| **T** | Tumors/Trauma | Ganglion, Lipoma, malunited [[Colles' Fracture]]. |
| **I** | Idiopathic | **Most Common Cause.** |
| **C** | Connective Tissue Disorders | Amyloidosis. |

### Clinical Features
*   **Demographics:** Commonly affects women (M:F ratio 1:3), usually between 40–50 years of age (perimenopausal).
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Pain and Paraesthesia:** Tingling, numbness, or burning sensation in the distribution of the [[Median Nerve]] (thumb, index, middle, and radial half of the ring finger).
    *   **Nocturnal Pain:** Characteristically wakes the patient at night.
    *   **Relieving Factors:** Patients often seek relief by hanging the arm over the bed side or shaking the hand violently (**Flick Sign**).
    *   **Clumsiness:** Difficulty in performing fine movements (e.g., buttoning a shirt, holding a needle) appearing in later stages.
    *   **Pain Radiation:** Can radiate proximally to the forearm, elbow, and sometimes shoulder.

**Clinical Implication:** The [[Palmar Cutaneous Branch]] of the median nerve arises *proximal* to the carpal tunnel and passes *over* the retinaculum. Therefore, sensation over the **thenar eminence** is usually spared in CTS.

### Clinical Staging
| Stage | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Stage I** | Pain is the main complaint; vague discomfort; morning stiffness; no precise localization. |
| **Stage II** | Symptoms (tingling/numbness) localized to median nerve territory; nocturnal symptoms prominent. |
| **Stage III** | Clumsiness in hand; impairment of digital functions. |
| **Stage IV** | Sensory loss in median nerve distribution; obvious wasting of [[Thenar Eminence]]. |

### Physical Examination (Signs)
**1. Look (Inspection):**
*   **Thenar Wasting:** Atrophy of the [[Thenar Muscles]] (Abductor Pollicis Brevis and Opponens Pollicis) results in a flattened thenar eminence (Ape Thumb deformity).
*   **Trophic Changes:** Dryness or skin changes on the radial 3.5 digits.

**2. Feel (Sensory Testing):**
*   **Hypoaesthesia:** Diminished sensation over the tip of the thumb, index, and middle fingers.
*   **Two-Point Discrimination:** May be increased (normal is <6mm).

**3. Move (Motor Testing):**
*   **Pen Test:** Tests [[Abductor Pollicis Brevis]]. The patient lays the hand flat on a table, palm up. The patient is asked to touch a pen held above the thumb by abducting the thumb vertically. Inability indicates paralysis.
*   **Opposition:** Weakness in touching the tip of the thumb to the tip of the little finger.

### Provocative Diagnostic Tests

| Test Name | Methodology | Positive Finding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phalen’s Test** | Patient actively places wrist in complete but unforced flexion (90 degrees) for 60 seconds. | Reproduction of tingling/numbness in median nerve distribution. |
| **Reverse Phalen’s** | Wrists extended (prayer position) for 1 minute. | Paresthesia in median nerve distribution. |
| **Tinel’s Sign** | Gentle percussion (tapping) over the [[Median Nerve]] at the wrist. | Electric shock-like sensation/tingling in the hand. |
| **Durkan’s Test** | Direct compression over the carpal tunnel with thumbs for 30 seconds. | Reproduction of symptoms. Considered the **most sensitive** clinical test. |
| **Tourniquet Test** | Inflating a BP cuff usually precipitates symptoms. | Reproduction of symptoms due to ischemia/venous congestion. |

### Investigations
1.  **X-rays:** Wrist/Hand (AP and Lateral) to rule out bony pathology (e.g., old fractures, osteophytes, arthritis).
2.  **Electrodiagnostic Studies (NCS/EMG):**
    *   **Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS):** Shows slowing of conduction velocity across the wrist (increased latency). This is the **Gold Standard** / Investigation of Choice for confirmation.
    *   **Electromyography (EMG):** Shows denervation potentials (fibrillations) in thenar muscles in advanced cases.
3.  **Ultrasonography/MRI:** May show flattening of the nerve or space-occupying lesions (ganglion, fibroma).
4.  **Blood Tests:** To screen for underlying causes (Thyroid profile, Blood sugar, Rheumatoid factor).

### Treatment

#### 1. Conservative Management
Indicated for mild cases, intermittent symptoms, or identifiable reversible causes (e.g., pregnancy).
*   **Activity Modification:** Avoid repetitive wrist movements.
*   **Splinting:** [[Carpal Tunnel Splint]] or Cock-up splint applied at night to keep the wrist in a neutral position.
*   **Medications:** NSAIDs for pain; Diuretics (if fluid retention is the cause).
*   **Local Steroid Injection:** Injection of Hydrocortisone or Triamcinolone into the carpal tunnel may provide temporary or permanent relief.

#### 2. Surgical Management
Indicated for failure of conservative treatment, severe symptoms, established sensory loss, or thenar wasting.
*   **Procedure:** **Carpal Tunnel Release**.
*   **Technique:** Can be Open or Endoscopic.
*   **Principle:** Division of the [[Flexor Retinaculum]] (Transverse Carpal Ligament) to decompress the [[Median Nerve]].
*   **Incision:** Longitudinal incision in the palm, generally in line with the ring finger, avoiding the palmar cutaneous branch.
