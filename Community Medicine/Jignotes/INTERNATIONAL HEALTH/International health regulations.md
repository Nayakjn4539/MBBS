# International Health Regulations (IHR)

### Definition and Purpose
The [[International Health Regulations]] (IHR) are a legally binding international legal instrument that applies to 196 countries, including all Member States of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).

*   **Primary Aim:** To prevent, protect against, control, and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade.
*   **Current Version:** The IHR (2005) replaced the older IHR (1969). The 1969 regulations were limited to only three diseases (Cholera, Plague, Yellow Fever), whereas the 2005 regulations broadened the scope significantly to include any public health emergency of international concern.

### Evolution of IHR
| Feature | IHR (1969) | IHR (2005) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scope** | Limited to specific diseases | All public health risks (biological, chemical, radiological) |
| **Notification** | Rigid list (Cholera, Plague, YF) | Algorithm-based decision instrument |
| **Focus** | Borders/Ports | Containment at source |
| **Concept** | "Maximum security" | "Global Health Security" |

### Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)
Under IHR (2005), countries must assess events within their territory using a "Decision Instrument" to determine if they constitute a [[PHEIC]]. An event is notifiable if it meets at least **two** of the following four criteria:
1.  Is the public health impact of the event serious?
2.  Is the event unusual or unexpected?
3.  Is there a significant risk of international spread?
4.  Is there a significant risk of international travel or trade restrictions?

### Disease Notification Requirements
Under IHR (2005), diseases are categorized based on notification requirements:

#### 1. Group A: Diseases that are **ALWAYS** Notifiable
A single case of the following four diseases must be immediately notified to the [[WHO]], irrespective of the context:
1.  **S**mallpox
2.  **P**oliomyelitis (due to wild-type poliovirus)
3.  **I**nfluenza (Human influenza caused by a new subtype)
4.  **S**ARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)

**Mnemonic:** **SPIS** (Spice) up the notification list.
*   **S**mallpox
*   **P**olio (wild)
*   **I**nfluenza (new subtype)
*   **S**ARS

#### 2. Group B: Diseases that **MAY** be Notifiable
These are notified only if they meet the PHEIC criteria (serious, unusual, risk of spread, risk to trade). Examples include:
*   [[Cholera]]
*   Pneumonic [[Plague]]
*   [[Yellow Fever]]
*   Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (Ebola, Lassa, Marburg)
*   West Nile Fever
*   Meningococcal disease

### Special Provisions for Yellow Fever
Yellow fever is the only disease for which an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis is currently required for entry into certain countries under the IHR.

*   **Designated Centers:** Vaccination must be done at designated centers.
*   **Validity:** The certificate becomes valid **10 days** after vaccination.
*   **Duration:** Previously valid for 10 years, an amendment in 2016 made the validity **lifetime** (for the duration of the life of the person vaccinated).
*   **Quarantine:** Travelers coming from endemic zones without a valid certificate may be quarantined for **6 days** (the incubation period) in a mosquito-proof ward.
*   **India's Status:** India is a "Yellow Fever Receptive Area" (has the vector *Aedes aegypti* and susceptible population/monkeys, but no virus). Hence, strict entry regulations are enforced.

### Vector Control at Ports
To prevent the importation of vectors (mosquitoes) or pathogens:
*   **Aedes aegypti Index:** Should be kept less than 1% in towns/seaports in endemic areas.
*   **Perimeter Control:** Airports and seaports must be kept free from mosquito breeding (specifically *Aedes aegypti*) for a distance of **400 meters** around the perimeter.
*   **Disinsection:** Aircraft and ships arriving from endemic areas are subjected to aerosol spraying (disinsection) to destroy insect vectors.

### Core Capacity Requirements
The IHR (2005) requires countries to develop core public health capacities to:
*   **Detect:** Surveillance systems to spot unusual health events.
*   **Assess:** Ability to evaluate the risk.
*   **Report:** Communication channels to notify WHO.
*   **Respond:** Capacity to investigate and control outbreaks.

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Travel Medicine:** Clinicians must advise travelers regarding mandatory vaccinations (e.g., Yellow Fever) and prophylaxis based on IHR guidelines.
*   **Surveillance:** Doctors are the first line of defense; recognizing and notifying a case of Wild Polio or a new Influenza strain is a legal obligation under national laws derived from IHR commitments.
