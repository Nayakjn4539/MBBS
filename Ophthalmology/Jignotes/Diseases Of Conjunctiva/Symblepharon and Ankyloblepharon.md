# Symblepharon

### Definition
[[Symblepharon]] is a condition characterized by the formation of adhesions between the [[palpebral conjunctiva]] (lining the eyelids) and the [[bulbar conjunctiva]] (covering the eyeball). This results in the eyelid becoming adherent to the eyeball.

### Etiology
It results from the healing of two opposing raw surfaces of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva.
*   **Trauma:** Chemical burns (alkali burns are worse than acid), thermal burns.
*   **Infections:** Membranous conjunctivitis (e.g., Diphtheria), severe purulent conjunctivitis.
*   **Immunological/Mucocutaneous Disorders:**
    *   [[Stevens-Johnson syndrome]] (SJS).
    *   [[Ocular Cicatricial Pemphigoid]] (OCP).
*   **Surgical/Iatrogenic:** Following excision of tumors or conjunctival ulceration.

### Clinical Types
Depending on the extent of the adhesion, it is classified into three types:

| Type | Description | Clinical Feature |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Anterior Symblepharon** | Adhesions connect the lid to the globe in the anterior part. | A probe **can be passed** underneath the adhesion (bridge-like). The fornix is usually free. |
| **Posterior Symblepharon** | Adhesions involve the [[fornix]]. | The fornix is obliterated. A probe **cannot** be passed to the full depth of the fornix. |
| **Total Symblepharon** | Adhesions involve the entire lid. | The lids are completely plastered to the globe. |

### Clinical Features
*   **Restricted Ocular Motility:** The adhesions physically limit the movement of the eye.
*   **[[Diplopia]]:** Occurs due to restricted motility in the direction opposite to the adhesion.
*   **[[Lagophthalmos]]:** Inability to close the eyelids fully, potentially leading to exposure.
*   **Cosmetic Disfigurement:** Visible fleshy bands connecting lid to eye.
*   **Dryness:** Can occur if goblet cells or ductules of the [[lacrimal gland]] are involved/obliterated.

### Management

#### 1. Prophylaxis (Preventive)
During the acute stage of raw surfaces (e.g., acute chemical burn):
*   **Mechanical Separation:** Sweeping a glass rod coated with antibiotic ointment or lubricant around the fornices several times a day to break forming adhesions.
*   **Devices:** Use of a large therapeutic [[soft contact lens]] or a scleral shell (glass shell) to separate the two raw surfaces.

#### 2. Curative Treatment (Symblepharectomy)
The surgical separation of adhesions is required for established cases.
*   **Mild Cases (Anterior Symblepharon):** Simple dissection (Symblepharectomy) and mobilizing the surrounding conjunctiva to cover the defect. [[Z-plasty]] may be performed.
*   **Severe/Extensive Cases:** After excising the scar tissue, the large raw area must be covered to prevent recurrence. Options include:
    *   **[[Autograft]]:** Using free conjunctival autograft from the same or fellow eye.
    *   **[[Amniotic Membrane Transplantation]] (AMT):** Used to cover the bare sclera and promote healing.
    *   **Mucosal Grafts:** Buccal mucous membrane graft (from the cheek) is used if the conjunctiva is insufficient.
    *   **Adjuncts:** Intraoperative **Mitomycin-C** may be used to reduce fibrosis in recurrent cases.

# Ankyloblepharon

### Definition
[[Ankyloblepharon]] refers to the adhesion between the **margins** of the upper and lower eyelids.
*   *Note the difference:* Unlike symblepharon (lid to globe), ankyloblepharon is lid to lid adhesion.

### Etiology
*   **Congenital:** Rare. Usually associated with other anomalies.
    *   **Ankyloblepharon Filiforme Adnatum (AFA):** A specific congenital type where single or multiple fine strands of connective tissue join the lid margins.
*   **Acquired:** Resulting from healing of raw surfaces on opposing lid margins.
    *   Chemical or thermal burns.
    *   Trauma/Injuries.
    *   Ulcerative [[blepharitis]].
    *   Membranous conjunctivitis (e.g., Diphtheria).

### Clinical Presentation
*   **Partial/Incomplete:** The eyelids are fused at certain points, usually reducing the horizontal length of the [[palpebral fissure]] (can mimic or cause **[[blepharophimosis]]**).
*   **Complete:** The eyelids are totally fused (rare).
*   It may be associated with symblepharon in severe burn cases.

### Treatment
*   **Surgical Separation:** The adhesions are excised (cut) to separate the lid margins.
*   **Prevention of Recurrence:** The raw marginal surfaces must be kept apart during the healing process.
*   **Epithelial Grafts:** If adhesions extend to the [[canthi]], grafts may be required to prevent re-adhesion at the angles.

### Comparison: Symblepharon vs. Ankyloblepharon

| Feature | **Symblepharon** | **Ankyloblepharon** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | Adhesion between **Lid** (palpebral conj.) and **Globe** (bulbar conj.) | Adhesion between **Upper Lid Margin** and **Lower Lid Margin** |
| **Location** | Conjunctival sac / Fornix | Palpebral aperture / Lid margins |
| **Primary Effect** | Restriction of eye movement (Diplopia) | Restriction of eye opening / Narrowing of palpebral fissure |
| **Congenital Form** | Rare | Ankyloblepharon Filiforme Adnatum |
| **Key Etiology** | Chemical burns, SJS, OCP | Burns, Trauma, Ulcerative Blepharitis |

### Clinical Implications
*   **Visual Prognosis:** In severe symblepharon (e.g., SJS or chemical burns), the loss of stem cells and dry eye often compromise the cornea, leading to blindness. In ankyloblepharon, vision is usually preserved unless amblyopia develops from deprivation in congenital cases.
*   **[[Pseudopterygium]]:** A form of symblepharon formed by the adhesion of a fold of bulbar conjunctiva to a corneal ulcer/marginal cornea. It is distinct because a probe *can* be passed underneath it near the limbus, unlike a true [[pterygium]].
