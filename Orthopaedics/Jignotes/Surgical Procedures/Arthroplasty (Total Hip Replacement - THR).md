# Arthroplasty: Total Hip Replacement (THR)

[[Total Hip Replacement]] (THR), or Total Hip Arthroplasty, is a reconstructive surgical procedure where both the articular surfaces of the hip joint—the **acetabulum** and the **femoral head**—are replaced with artificial components (prostheses). It is considered one of the most successful operations in orthopedics, significantly improving quality of life by relieving pain and restoring function.

### Indications
The primary goal is to treat incapacitating arthritis or severe trauma where preservation of the native joint is impossible.

*   **Degenerative Joint Disease:**
    *   Primary [[Osteoarthritis]] (most common indication).
    *   Secondary Osteoarthritis (e.g., post-traumatic, post-DDH).
*   **Inflammatory Arthritis:**
    *   [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]].
    *   [[Ankylosing Spondylitis]] (may require THR for fused hips).
*   **Bone Vascularity Disorders:**
    *   [[Avascular Necrosis]] (AVN) of the femoral head (Stage III/IV).
*   **Trauma:**
    *   [[Fracture Neck of Femur]] (Intracapsular) in elderly patients (>60 years) where the head is non-viable or the acetabulum is damaged,.
    *   Non-union of femoral neck fractures.
*   **Others:**
    *   Failed [[Hemiarthroplasty]].
    *   Quiescent [[Tuberculosis of Hip]] (controversial, requires strict disease control).

### Contraindications
**Absolute:**
*   Active [[Infection]] (local or systemic).
*   Neuropathic joints (Charcot’s joint).

**Relative:**
*   Poor medical or anesthetic risk.
*   Morbid [[Obesity]].
*   Young age (<50 years) – due to the finite lifespan of the prosthesis (though modern ceramics are expanding this indication).
*   Severe osteoporosis (risk of periprosthetic fracture).

### Types of Prosthesis and Fixation
The artificial joint consists of an **Acetabular component** (cup) and a **Femoral component** (stem and head).

| Feature | **Cemented THR** | **Uncemented THR** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fixation Method** | Uses [[Polymethylmethacrylate]] (PMMA) bone cement to bond bone and metal. | Press-fit design; relies on biological bone ingrowth into porous/hydroxyapatite coated surface. |
| **Indication** | Elderly patients, Osteoporotic bone. | Young, active patients with good bone stock. |
| **Advantages** | Immediate stability, earlier weight bearing. | Biological fixation, easier revision if needed later. |
| **Components** | Typically Polyethylene cup + Metal stem. | Metal shell with liner + Metal stem. |

### Surgical Technique

#### 1. Pre-operative Planning
*   Template sizing using X-rays to estimate implant size.
*   Evaluation of leg length discrepancy.
*   [[Prophylactic Antibiotics]] administered before incision.

#### 2. Anesthesia and Positioning
*   Usually **Spinal Anesthesia** or Epidural.
*   **Lateral decubitus position** is most commonly used.

#### 3. Surgical Approaches
*   **[[Posterior Approach]] (Moore’s/Southern):** Most common; preserves abductors but higher risk of posterior dislocation.
*   **Lateral Approach (Hardinge):** Lower dislocation risk, but involves splitting the gluteus medius/minimus.
*   **Anterolateral Approach (Watson-Jones):** Reduces dislocation risk but technically demanding.

#### 4. Surgical Steps (Modified Hardinge/Lateral Approach)
1.  **Incision:** Straight lateral incision centered over the greater trochanter.
2.  **Exposure:** Division of fascia lata. The gluteus medius and vastus lateralis are split or detached to expose the capsule.
3.  **Capsulotomy & Dislocation:** The capsule is incised (T-shaped or H-shaped). The hip is dislocated by flexion, adduction, and external rotation.
4.  **Femoral Neck Osteotomy:** The femoral neck is cut using an oscillating saw based on pre-determined landmarks/templating.
5.  **Acetabular Preparation:**
    *   [[Acetabular Labrum]] excision.
    *   Reaming of the acetabulum with hemispherical reamers to expose bleeding subchondral bone.
    *   Insertion of the **Acetabular Cup** (press-fit or cemented) and the liner (polyethylene/ceramic).

6.  **Femoral Preparation:**
    *   The proximal femur is elevated.
    *   The [[Medullary Canal]] is located with a box osteotome and opened.
    *   **Broaching:** Sequential broaches are used to shape the canal until a snug fit is achieved.
7.  **Trial Reduction:** A trial stem and head are inserted. The hip is reduced to check for:
    *   Stability (range of motion without dislocation).
    *   Limb length.
    *   Soft tissue tension.
8.  **Final Implantation:** The real femoral stem is inserted (cemented or press-fit). The modular head is impacted onto the trunnion.
9.  **Closure:** The hip is reduced. The capsule and abductors are repaired. Layered closure over a suction drain (optional).

***Clinical Implication:** Incorrect positioning of the acetabular cup (e.g., excessive vertical inclination) significantly increases the risk of post-operative dislocation and edge-loading wear.*

### Complications

#### Intra-operative
*   **Fracture:** Of the femur (during broaching) or acetabulum (during cup impaction),.
*   **Neurovascular Injury:**
    *   [[Sciatic Nerve]] palsy (most common, often due to retractor pressure or lengthening).
    *   Femoral nerve/artery injury (rare).
*   **Hemodynamic instability:** Hypotension during cement insertion (Bone Cement Implantation Syndrome).

#### Post-operative (Early)
*   **[[Deep Vein Thrombosis]] (DVT) & Pulmonary Embolism:** High risk in hip surgery. Requires pharmacological (LMWH) and mechanical prophylaxis,.
*   **Dislocation:** Risk is highest in the first few weeks. Patients must avoid flexion >90° and adduction past midline (for posterior approach).
*   **Infection:** A disastrous complication requiring debridement or two-stage revision arthroplasty.

#### Late Complications
*   **Aseptic Loosening:** The most common cause of long-term failure.
*   **Osteolysis:** Bone loss caused by reaction to wear debris (polyethylene particles).
*   **[[Heterotopic Ossification]]:** Formation of bone in soft tissues, leading to stiffness. Prophylaxis with NSAIDs (Indomethacin) may be used.

### Post-operative Rehabilitation
*   **Mobilization:** Can begin as early as the next day with bedside standing and walking with a walker.
*   **Exercises:** Active and active-assisted hip/knee exercises.
*   **Weight Bearing:**
    *   Cemented: Often allowed immediate weight bearing as tolerated.
    *   Uncemented: Partial weight bearing might be advised for 6 weeks to allow bony ingrowth.
*   **Precautions:** Avoid sitting on low chairs, crossing legs, or squatting to prevent dislocation.
