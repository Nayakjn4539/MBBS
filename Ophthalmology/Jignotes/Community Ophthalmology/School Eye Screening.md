# [[Community Ophthalmology]] > School Eye Screening

### **School Eye Screening Programme (SESP)**

The School Eye Screening Programme is a vital component of the [[National Programme for Control of Blindness and Visual Impairment]] (NPCB&VI) and the [[Vision 2020]] initiative. It is designed to identify and treat common ocular morbidities in school-going children, primarily focusing on uncorrected [[refractive errors]], which are the most common cause of visual impairment in this demographic,.

#### **Objectives**
1.  **Early Detection:** To identify children with [[refractive errors]], [[amblyopia]] (lazy eye), [[squint]], [[cataract]], and active [[trachoma]] at an early stage.
2.  **Prevention:** To prevent permanent [[blindness]] or visual impairment through timely intervention (e.g., [[Vitamin A deficiency]], [[Amblyopia]]).
3.  **Awareness:** To promote eye health education within the school curriculum and community.

#### **Target Population**
*   **Primary Target:** Middle and Secondary school children.
    *   Specifically, children enrolled in **Classes V to VIII** (approximate age 10–14 years) are often targeted for refractive error screening.
*   **Broader Screening:** Ideally, screening should occur at school entry and periodically every 3 years for normal children, and annually for those with defects.
*   **Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK):** This program covers children from 6 to 18 years in government and government-aided schools for "4 Ds" (Defects, Deficiencies, Diseases, Developmental delays), which includes eye conditions,.

#### **Methodology and Infrastructure**

The programme operates on a tiered system involving school teachers and ophthalmic personnel.

##### **1. Initial Screening (The Role of Teachers)**
School teachers act as the primary screening personnel. This strategy is cost-effective and utilizes the close proximity of teachers to students.
*   **Training:** Selected teachers (usually one per school) undergo a one-day training session on assessing [[visual acuity]] and identifying gross eye defects.
*   **Ratio:** Approximately **1 teacher per 150 students** is trained for screening.
*   **Screening Tools:**
    *   **Vision Screening Cards:** Specially designed "E" cards or [[Snellen's chart]] containing optotypes corresponding to the **6/9 line**.
    *   Measurement tape (to ensure correct testing distance of 6 meters).
*   **Procedure:**
    *   Teachers measure the visual acuity of each child.
    *   **Referral Criteria:** Any child who cannot read the **6/9 optotype** with **either eye** (Visual Acuity $\le$ 6/9) is identified as having a defect,.

##### **2. Refraction and Confirmation (Secondary Level)**
Children identified by teachers are referred to the next level of care.
*   **Personnel:** **Paramedical Ophthalmic Assistants (PMOA)** or [[Optometrists]].
*   **Location:** Upgraded [[Primary Health Centre]] (PHC) or Community Health Centre (CHC).
*   **Action:**
    *   Verification of visual acuity.
    *   Objective and subjective **refraction** to determine the prescription for spectacles.
    *   Examination for other ocular pathologies (e.g., [[Bitot's spots]], [[ptosis]], [[corneal opacity]]).

##### **3. Management and Optical Services**
*   **Prescription:** Children requiring [[spectacles]] are identified.
*   **Provision:** The **District Blindness Control Society (DBCS)** arranges for the provision of good quality, low-cost, or free spectacles through local opticians or NGOs.
*   **Advanced Referral:** Cases requiring surgical intervention (e.g., [[congenital cataract]], [[squint]]) are referred to the District Hospital or Tertiary Eye Care Centres.

| Feature | Primary Screening (School) | Secondary Evaluation (PHC/CHC) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Performer** | Trained School Teacher | Ophthalmic Assistant / Optometrist |
| **Target** | All students (Class V-VIII) | Students referred by teachers |
| **Tool** | Vision Screening Card / Snellen Chart | Retinoscope, Trial Set, Ophthalmoscope |
| **Criteria** | Visual Acuity $\le$ 6/9 in either eye | Refractive error / Pathology confirmation |
| **Action** | Refer to PMOA | Prescribe glasses / Refer to specialist |,

#### **Integration with Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK)**
The [[Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram]] is a broader child health initiative under the [[National Health Mission]] that encompasses school eye screening.
*   **Age Group:** 6 years to 18 years (School-going children).
*   **Screening Method:** Dedicated **Mobile Health Teams** visiting schools and questionnaires filled by teachers/parents.
*   **Scope (The 4 Ds):**
    *   **Defects at Birth:** e.g., [[Congenital cataract]].
    *   **Deficiencies:** e.g., [[Vitamin A deficiency]] ([[Bitot's spots]]).
    *   **Diseases:** e.g., [[Refractive errors]], [[Otitis media]].
    *   **Developmental Delays:** Vision impairment.

---

#### **Clinical Implications & Importance**
*   **Amblyopia Prevention:** Uncorrected refractive errors are a leading cause of [[amblyopia]] (lazy eye). Screening and correction before the age of 8-10 years can reverse or prevent permanent vision loss.
*   **Academic Performance:** Poor vision is directly linked to poor academic performance. Teachers often notice a child squeezing their eyes or copying from a neighbor's notebook, which are signs of [[myopia]].
*   **Avoidable Blindness:** Refractive errors account for a significant portion (approx 19.7%) of blindness/visual impairment in India; school screening is the most effective tool to address this.
