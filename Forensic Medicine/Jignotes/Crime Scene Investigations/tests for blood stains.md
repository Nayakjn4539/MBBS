# [[Crime Scene Investigations]] > tests for blood stains

### Classification of Tests for Blood Stains

The examination of [[blood stains]] in forensic serology follows a sequential protocol to answer three fundamental questions:
1.  Is it blood? (Screening and Confirmatory tests)
2.  Is it human blood? (Species identification)
3.  Whose blood is it? (Grouping and DNA profiling)

### I. Physical Examination

Before chemical testing, visual inspection is the first step.
*   **Appearance:**
    *   **Fresh:** Reddish-brown.
    *   **Old:** Reddish-brown to black or blackish-brown.
    *   **Fabric texture:** Blood stains often stiffen the fabric.
*   **Ultra-Violet (UV) Light:** Stains appear dark against a fluorescent background. This is useful for locating stains on dark clothing, but it is not specific.

---

### II. Screening / Presumptive Tests

These tests rely on the **peroxidase-like activity** of the [[heme]] group in hemoglobin. When a specific reagent is added to the stain in the presence of Hydrogen Peroxide ($H_2O_2$), the oxygen released oxidizes the reagent to produce a colored compound.

**Properties:**
*   **High Sensitivity:** Can detect blood in very high dilutions (1 in 100,000 to 1 in 5,000,000).
*   **Low Specificity:** Can give **False Positives** with vegetable peroxidases (e.g., horseradish, beetroot), rust, copper salts, and synthetic dyes.
*   **Inference:** A negative result *excludes* blood; a positive result only indicates the *probability* of blood.

#### Common Screening Tests

| Test Name | Reagent Used | Color Reaction | Remarks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Benzidine Test** (Adler's Test) | Benzidine in glacial acetic acid + $H_2O_2$ | **Intense Blue** | Highly sensitive but **carcinogenic**; largely obsolete. |
| **Phenolphthalein Test** ([[Kastle-Meyer Test]]) | Phenolphthalein + KOH + $H_2O_2$ | **Pink/Purple** | Very sensitive (1:5 million). Reagent is reduced phenolphthalein (leuco-form) kept in alkaline solution. |
| **Orthotoluidine Test** | Orthotoluidine | **Intense Blue** | Similar to Benzidine but reportedly less carcinogenic, though still hazardous. |
| **Luminol Spray** | Luminol reagent | **Blue-white Luminescence** | Visible in the dark. Extremely sensitive. Useful for large areas or cleaned/washed stains. Does not interfere with subsequent DNA analysis. |
| **Leucomalachite Green** | Leucomalachite green | **Greenish-blue** | Mentioned in modern contexts. |

> **Mnemonic for Screening Colors:**
> *   **B**enzidine = **B**lue
> *   **K**astle-**M**eyer = **M**agentapink (Pink)
> *   **L**uminol = **L**uminescence

### III. Confirmatory Tests

These tests prove the presence of blood derivatives (hemoglobin or its derivatives) conclusively.

#### 1. Microscopic Examination
*   **Technique:** A small crust of the stain is soaked in **Vibert's fluid** (NaCl + Mercuric chloride) or normal saline to rehydrate cells.
*   **Findings:**
    *   **Mammals:** Circular, biconcave, **non-nucleated** discs.
    *   **Camels:** Oval, biconvex, **non-nucleated**.
    *   **Birds/Amphibians/Reptiles/Fish:** Oval, biconvex, **nucleated**.
*   **Limitations:** Intact RBCs are hard to find in old or dried stains.

#### 2. Micro-Chemical Crystal Tests
These tests form specific crystals of hemoglobin derivatives.

**A. Teichmann’s Test (Haemin Crystal Test)**
*   **Reagents:** Sodium chloride (NaCl) + Glacial Acetic Acid.
*   **Procedure:** Heated gently under a coverslip.
*   **Observation:** **Brownish-black, Rhombic** crystals of [[Haemin]] (Hematin chloride).
*   **Drawback:** May fail in old stains or stains exposed to sunlight/heat.

**B. Takayama’s Test (Haemochromogen Crystal Test)**
*   **Reagents:** Pyridine + Glucose (reducing agent) + NaOH (alkali).
*   **Observation:** **Pink, Feathery** crystals of [[Haemochromogen]] (Pyridine ferroprotoporphyrin).
*   **Advantage:** More reliable than Teichmann’s; works well even with old stains.

> **Mnemonic for Crystals:**
> *   **T**eichmann = **R**hombic (**TR**uck tires are rhombic/tough)
> *   **T**akayama = **P**ink **F**eathers (**T**ake **P**ink **F**eathers)

#### 3. Spectroscopic Examination
*   The most reliable method for detecting blood.
*   Identifies hemoglobin and its derivatives (oxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin) based on characteristic absorption bands in the spectrum.
*   Old stains can be detected even if the pigment has degraded.

### IV. Species Identification (Immunological Test)

Once confirmed as blood, it must be determined if it is human.

#### Precipitin Test
*   **Principle:** Antigen-Antibody reaction.
*   **Technique:**
    *   Antihuman serum (produced by injecting human serum into a rabbit) is placed in a test tube.
    *   Extract of the blood stain is layered over it.
*   **Result:** A **white precipitate ring** forms at the junction of the two fluids within 20 minutes if the blood is human.
*   **Specificity:** Highly specific. It can differentiate human blood from animal blood. It can also be applied to other tissues like semen, saliva, and bone.
*   **Other Methods:**
    *   Gel diffusion.
    *   Cross-over electrophoresis.
    *   Antiglobulin consumption test.

### V. Individualization (Whose blood is it?)

#### 1. ABO Blood Grouping
*   **Method:** Absorption-elution technique is commonly used for dried stains.
*   **Secretor Status:** 80% of people secrete blood group antigens (A, B, H) in body fluids (saliva, semen), which can be matched to the blood.

#### 2. DNA Profiling ([[DNA Fingerprinting]])
*   **Technique:** [[Polymerase Chain Reaction]] (PCR) and Short Tandem Repeats (STR).
*   **Sample:** Can be extracted from WBCs in the blood stain.
*   **Reliability:** The most definitive method for linking a stain to a specific individual.

### Medicolegal Aspects of Blood Stains

1.  **Crime Scene Reconstruction:** [[Bloodstain Pattern Analysis]] (e.g., shape of drops, spurts, trails) helps determine the direction of impact, type of weapon, and movement of the victim/assailant.
    *   *Vertical drop:* Round stain with crenated edges.
    *   *Angled drop:* Teardrop shape; the pointed end indicates the direction of travel.
2.  **Age of Stain:** Fresh stains are soluble in water; old stains require prolonged soaking. Color changes from red to brown/black over time.
3.  **Source Identification:**
    *   *Menstrual blood:* Acidic pH, non-coagulable, presence of endometrial/vaginal cells and *Trichomonas*.
    *   *Nasal bleed:* Presence of nasal mucus/hair.
4.  **Chain of Custody:** Essential to prove who handled the evidence to prevent tampering. Samples must be dried before packing in paper bags (never plastic) to prevent putrefaction.
