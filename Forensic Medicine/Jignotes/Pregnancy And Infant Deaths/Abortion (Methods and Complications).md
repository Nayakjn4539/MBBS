# [[Pregnancy And Infant Deaths]] > Abortion (Methods and Complications)

### [[Abortion]] (Methods and Complications)

**Definition:**
Medically, abortion is the expulsion or extraction from its mother of an embryo or fetus weighing **500 g or less** (approx. 22 weeks gestation), when it is not capable of independent survival.
Legally (Sec 312 IPC), it is the premature expulsion of the product of conception at any time before the full term is reached.

### Classification
1.  **Natural (Spontaneous):** Due to pathology in the mother or fetus (e.g., chromosomal defects, infections like TORCH, uterine anomalies).
2.  **Induced:**
    *   **Legal:** [[Medical Termination of Pregnancy]] (MTP) under the MTP Act, 1971.
    *   **Illegal (Criminal):** [[Criminal Abortion]] performed without legal justification, often by unskilled persons.

### Methods of Procuring Criminal Abortion

These methods are often crude, dangerous, and performed in unhygienic conditions.

#### 1. General Violence
*   **Severe Exercise:** Violent exercise, jumping from heights, carrying heavy weights.
*   **Abdominal Trauma:** Severe pressure on the abdomen, kneading the abdomen (massaging vigorously), tight lacing, or kicks/blows to the abdomen.
*   **Cupping:** Application of hot cups to the epigastrium or thighs (counter-irritation).

#### 2. Administration of Abortifacient Drugs
These drugs are used to induce uterine contractions or cause systemic toxicity.

| Category | Examples | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ecbolics** | [[Ergot]], [[Quinine]], Cotton root bark, Synthetic Oxytocin, Prostaglandins | Directly stimulate uterine contractions. |
| **Emmenagogues** | Borax, Sanguinarine ([[Argemone mexicana]]), Estrogens | Increase menstrual flow and uterine congestion. |
| **G.I. Irritants** | [[Castor Oil]], [[Croton Oil]], Aloes, Colocynth | Cause severe purgation; irritation spreads to the uterus reflexly. |
| **G.U. Irritants** | Cantharides, Turpentine oil | Irritate bladder and kidneys; reflex uterine contraction. |
| **Systemic Poisons** | [[Lead]], [[Arsenic]], [[Mercury]], Copper | Kill the fetus or cause severe maternal toxemia leading to expulsion. |

*Mnemonic for Abortifacient Drugs:* **"EGGs"**
*   **E**cbolics
*   **G**I Irritants
*   **G**U Irritants
*   **S**ystemic Poisons

#### 3. Local Violence (Instrumentation)
This is the most dangerous but effective method.
*   **Syringing:** Injection of fluids (soap water, alum, Lysol, Potassium Permanganate) into the uterus using a Higginson’s syringe.
    *   *Risk:* [[Air Embolism]], Chemical embolism, [[Vagal inhibition]].
*   **Instrumentation:** Passing sounds, catheters, knitting needles, or hairpins to rupture membranes.
*   **Abortion Stick:** A thin stick (bamboo/wood) wrapped with cotton soaked in irritant juices like **Calotropis**, **Oleander**, or **Marking nut** juice is inserted into the cervical os and left there.
*   **Dilatation of Cervix:** Using Laminaria tents or slippery elm bark which swell upon absorbing moisture, dilating the cervix.
*   **Vacuum Aspiration:** Unskilled use can lead to perforation.

### Methods of Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Legal)

**First Trimester (upto 12 weeks):**
*   **Medical:** [[Mifepristone]] (RU-486) followed by [[Misoprostol]].
*   **Surgical:**
    *   Menstrual Regulation (MR).
    *   Manual Vacuum Aspiration (MVA).
    *   Suction Evacuation/Curettage.
    *   Dilatation and Curettage (D&C).

**Second Trimester (12–20 weeks):**
*   **Prostaglandins:** Intra-amniotic or extra-amniotic injection.
*   **Oxytocin drip.**
*   **Ethacridine Lactate:** Extra-amniotic instillation.
*   **Hysterotomy:** Rarely done now.

### Complications of Criminal Abortion

Complications are the usual reason these cases become medicolegal.

#### 1. Immediate Complications
*   **[[Vagal Inhibition]] (Neurogenic Shock):** Sudden death due to manipulation of the cervix or rapid injection of cold/hot fluids.
*   **Hemorrhage:** Severe bleeding from uterine perforation, cervical tears, or retained products.
*   **[[Air Embolism]]:** Entry of air into opened uterine sinuses (especially during syringing).
*   **Amniotic Fluid Embolism:** Entry of amniotic fluid into maternal circulation causing DIC and shock.
*   **Fat Embolism:** If soapy water or oily substances are used.

#### 2. Delayed Complications (24 hours to days)
*   **Sepsis ([[Septic Abortion]]):** Due to unsterile instruments. Can lead to septicemia, endotoxic shock, peritonitis, and salpingitis.
    *   *Clostridium welchii* infection is particularly dangerous.
*   **Tetanus.**
*   **Renal Failure:** Due to shock, septicemia, or nephrotoxic abortifacients (e.g., Lysol, Mercury).

#### 3. Remote Complications
*   **Sterility:** Secondary infertility due to tubal block or endometritis.
*   **Chronic Pelvic Pain:** PID (Pelvic Inflammatory Disease).
*   **Menstrual Disturbances.**
*   **Recurrent Abortions:** Due to cervical incompetence.
*   **Psychological sequelae:** Depression, guilt.

*Mnemonic for Immediate Causes of Death:* **"HASH"**
*   **H**emorrhage
*   **A**ir Embolism
*   **S**hock (Neurogenic/Vagal)
*   **H**ormonal/Fluid Embolism (Amniotic/Fat)

### Medicolegal Aspects & Autopsy Findings

In suspected criminal abortion deaths, the autopsy must prove pregnancy, interference, and the link between interference and death.

**External Findings:**
*   **Signs of Pregnancy:** Breasts may be enlarged; pigmentation of areola; linea nigra.
*   **Signs of Violence:** Bruises on the abdomen, inner thighs, or perineum (from positioning).
*   **Face:** May be pale (hemorrhage) or cyanosed (embolism/shock).

**Internal Findings:**
*   **[[Uterus]]:**
    *   Look for perforation, tears, or signs of inflammation.
    *   Presence of placental site, retained products of conception.
    *   Foreign bodies (sticks, gauze, catheters) in the cavity.
    *   **Air Embolism Test:** Open the heart underwater before opening major vessels. Bubbles from the right ventricle indicate air embolism.
*   **Ovaries:** Presence of **Corpus Luteum** confirms recent pregnancy.
*   **Vagina/Cervix:** Erosions, chemical burns (if KMnO4 or irritants used), or mechanical injuries (vulsellum marks).
*   **Stomach/Intestines:** Look for irritant poisons if drugs were taken orally.
