# [[Asphyxia]] > suffocation

### Suffocation

[[Suffocation]] is a form of [[asphyxia]] caused by the deprivation of oxygen, either due to a lack of oxygen in the environment or due to mechanical obstruction of the air passages at the level of the nose and mouth, *without* compression of the neck.

---

### Classification of Suffocation

Suffocation is broadly classified based on the mechanism of obstruction:

1.  **Smothering** (Closure of external orifices)
2.  **Gagging** (Obstruction of pharynx)
3.  **Choking** (Obstruction of internal airways)
4.  **Traumatic/Crush Asphyxia** (Compression of chest/abdomen)
5.  **Burking** (Combination of smothering and traumatic asphyxia)
6.  **Positional Asphyxia** (Body position preventing breathing)
7.  **Environmental Suffocation** (Entrapment/Suffocating gases)

### 1. Smothering

**Definition:** Mechanical closure of the external respiratory orifices (nose and mouth) by hand, cloth, pillow, or other materials.

**Medicolegal Aspects:**
*   **Accidental:** Common in infants (overlaying, plastic bags), epileptics (face down on pillow), or intoxicated persons.
*   **Suicidal:** Impossible by hand (hands relax upon unconsciousness). Possible with plastic bags tied around the neck or burying the face in a mattress.
*   **Homicidal:** Difficult in active adults unless incapacitated (drugs/alcohol). Common in infants, elderly, or debilitated persons.

**Autopsy Findings:**
*   **External:**
    *   Often **negative** if soft objects like a pillow are used ("Gentle Homicide").
    *   **Pale/White area** around mouth/nose due to pressure if pressed into a pillow.
    *   **Abrasions/Bruises:** If hands are used, crescentic nail marks or bruises may be seen around the lips and nose.
    *   [[Asphyxial signs]] (petechiae, cyanosis) may be absent or minimal unless there was a struggle.
*   **Internal:**
    *   Blood/saliva/tissue cells may be found on the pillow.
    *   Lips/gums may show bruising/laceration (inner aspect) due to pressure against teeth.

> *   **F**oreign material (fibers/feathers) in nose/mouth
> *   **A**brasions around mouth
> *   **C**yanosis (variable)
> *   **E**cchymosis of inner lips

### 2. Gagging

**Definition:** Obstruction of the air passages by forcing a foreign object (cloth, paper, rags) into the mouth/pharynx.

**Mechanism of Death:**
*   Direct obstruction of the pharynx.
*   Accumulation of saliva and edema of the pharynx/nasal mucosa secondary to the gag.
*   Often homicide (to silence victim) or accidental (infants).

---

### 3. Choking

**Definition:** Obstruction of the *internal* air passages (larynx/trachea) by a foreign body (food, coins, teeth, vomit).

**Causes:**
*   **Inhalation of food:** Large bolus of meat ("Cafe Coronary"), dentures, round objects.
*   **Regurgitation:** Aspiration of vomit in unconscious/intoxicated patients.
*   **Diseases:** Diphtheria membrane, laryngeal edema.

**Café Coronary:**
*   Sudden collapse of a healthy person while eating.
*   Often mistaken for myocardial infarction (heart attack).
*   Caused by a large bolus of food impacting the glottis.
*   **Mechanism:** [[Reflex vagal inhibition]] or acute laryngeal spasm, not just simple air hunger.

**Autopsy Findings:**
*   **Foreign Body:** Found in the larynx, trachea, or bifurcation of bronchi.
*   **Airways:** Presence of food particles embedded in thick mucus.
*   **General Signs:** Cyanosis, subconjunctival hemorrhages (without cutaneous petechiae).

### 4. Traumatic Asphyxia (Crush Asphyxia)

**Definition:** Mechanical fixation of the chest and/or abdomen prevents respiratory movements (inspiration/expiration), even if the airway is patent.

**Causes:**
*   Stampedes (crowd crush).
*   Building collapse/Landslides.
*   Vehicle accidents (steering wheel compression, jack failure).
*   "Jack-knife" position.

**Mechanism:**
*   Compression of the chest prevents venous return to the heart.
*   Valveless veins of the head and neck allow backflow of blood under high pressure.

**Clinical Features & Autopsy Findings:**
*   **[[Masque Ecchymotique]] (Ecchymotic Mask):** Intense deep purple/red congestion and cyanosis of the face, neck, and upper chest *above* the level of compression.
*   **Demarcation:** Sharp line of color change; skin below the compression is pale.
*   **Petechiae:** Massive confluent petechiae in conjunctivae (red eyes), face, and scalp.
*   **Internal:** Congestion of lungs and brain; rib fractures may be present.

### 5. Burking

**Definition:** A specific method of homicidal asphyxia combining **Smothering** and **Traumatic Asphyxia**.

**Origin:** Named after William Burke and William Hare (19th Century Edinburgh), who killed victims to sell bodies for anatomical dissection.

**Method:**
1.  The victim is thrown down (often intoxicated).
2.  The assailant kneels/sits on the victim's chest (Traumatic Asphyxia).
3.  Simultaneously closes the mouth and nostrils with hands (Smothering).

**Autopsy Finding:** Minimal external signs of violence, except perhaps minor bruising on the chest or around the face. Very effective method of killing with little trace.

### 6. Positional (Postural) Asphyxia

**Definition:** Death occurs because the position of the body prevents adequate gas exchange, usually when the person is unable to move out of that position.

**Risk Factors:**
*   Intoxication (Alcohol/Drugs).
*   Unconsciousness/Stupor.
*   Obesity.
*   Neurological diseases (Epilepsy).

**Common Positions:**
*   Head down (inverted suspension) - abdominal viscera push diaphragm up.
*   "Hog-tied" (wrists and ankles tied together behind the back).
*   Neck hyperflexion (chin on chest) in infants/intoxicated.

---

### 7. Environmental Suffocation

**Mechanism:** Deprivation of oxygen due to displacement by other gases or depletion in an enclosed space.

**Scenarios:**
*   **Entrapment:** Disused refrigerators, air-tight trunks, bank vaults (oxygen consumption leads to hypoxia and hypercapnia).
*   **Suffocating Gases:** Inhalation of inert gases like Carbon Dioxide (sewers/wells), Methane, Nitrogen.
    *   **Choke damp:** $CO_2$ in mines.
    *   **Sewer gas:** $H_2S$, $CO_2$, Methane.
