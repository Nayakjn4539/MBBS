# [[Pediatric Orthopaedics]] > Management of DDH

### Management of Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH)

The management of [[Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip]] (DDH) is strictly age-dependent. The primary goal is to achieve and maintain a concentric reduction of the [[femoral head]] within the [[acetabulum]] to allow for normal bony development and prevent long-term sequelae like [[osteoarthritis]].

---

#### 1. Age: Birth to 6 Months (Pre-Crawling Stage)
In this age group, the dysplasia is predominantly soft-tissue related, and the [[acetabulum]] has high remodeling potential.

**Standard Treatment: [[Pavlik Harness]]**
*   **Mechanism:** It is a dynamic splint that holds the hip in flexion and abduction while allowing some motion ("safe zone").
    *   **Anterior strap:** Flexes the hip to 100°–110° (Prevents extension/dislocation).
    *   **Posterior strap:** Abducts the hip (Prevents adduction/subluxation).
*   **Duration:** Usually worn 23 hours/day for 6–12 weeks until the hip is stable and ultrasound confirms normal indices.
*   **Monitoring:** Weekly or bi-weekly clinical checks and [[ultrasound]] to ensure reduction.

**Alternative Splints**
*   **[[Von Rosen Splint]]:** A malleable H-shaped splint used if the Pavlik harness fails or is unavailable. It is a static splint (rigid immobilization).
*   **[[Craig Splint]] / [[Ilfeld Splint]]:** Other abduction orthoses.

**Clinical Implications & Complications**
*   **[[Femoral Nerve Palsy]]:** Caused by excessive flexion (hyperflexion). If the baby stops kicking, the harness must be loosened immediately.
*   **[[Avascular Necrosis]] (AVN):** Caused by excessive abduction (forced abduction). This compresses the retinacular vessels.
*   **Failure:** If the hip is not reduced within 3–4 weeks of harness wear, the harness is abandoned to prevent [[Pavlik Harness Disease]] (erosion of the posterior acetabulum).

---

#### 2. Age: 6 Months to 18 Months
At this stage, soft tissue contractures (specifically the [[iliopsoas]] and [[adductor muscles]]) develop, and the child is larger/stronger, making the harness ineffective.

**Primary Treatment: [[Closed Reduction]] (CR)**
*   Performed under general anesthesia.
*   **Procedure:**
    *   Gentle manipulation to reduce the head.
    *   Often accompanied by a percutaneous **[[Adductor Tenotomy]]** to widen the "safe zone" of reduction.
    *   Arthrogram may be used to confirm concentric reduction.
*   **Immobilization:** [[Hip Spica Cast]].
    *   **Position:** The "Human Position" (100° flexion, 40-45° abduction).
    *   **Avoid:** The "Frog-leg position" (90° abduction) due to high risk of [[Avascular Necrosis]].
    *   **Duration:** Cast is changed every 6 weeks for a total of 3–4 months.

**Secondary Treatment: [[Open Reduction]] (OR)**
*   **Indications:** Failure of closed reduction or presence of anatomical blocks to reduction.
*   **Anatomical Blocks to Reduction:**
    1.  Inverted [[Limbus]] (labrum).
    2.  Hypertrophied [[Ligamentum Teres]].
    3.  Transverse Acetabular Ligament.
    4.  Pulvinar (Fibrofatty tissue in the acetabulum).
    5.  Constricted capsule (hourglass constriction).
    6.  Tight [[Iliopsoas tendon]].
*   **Approaches:**
    *   **[[Medial Approach]] (Ludloff/Ferguson):** Less invasive, but risk to [[Medial Circumflex Femoral Artery]].
    *   **[[Anterior Approach]] (Smith-Petersen):** Better exposure, allows capsulorrhaphy.

#### 3. Age: 18 Months to 3-4 Years
In toddlers, simple reduction is insufficient due to bony changes (femoral anteversion, acetabular dysplasia) and significant soft tissue shortening.

**Management Protocol**
1.  **[[Open Reduction]]:** Usually via anterior approach.
2.  **[[Femoral Shortening Osteotomy]]:** A segment of the femur is removed to reduce pressure on the femoral head, thereby preventing [[Avascular Necrosis]].
3.  **[[Derotation Osteotomy]]:** Corrects excessive [[femoral anteversion]].
4.  **[[Pelvic Osteotomy]]:** Required if there is significant residual [[acetabular dysplasia]] (Acetabular Index > 30°).

---

#### 4. Age: > 4 Years (Children and Adolescents)
Treatment becomes complex. The remodeling potential of the acetabulum is limited. Procedures are categorized into reconstructive (redirecting/reshaping) or salvage.

**Pelvic Osteotomies (Classified by Function)**

| Type of Osteotomy | Procedure Name | Description | Indication/Age |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Redirection** | **[[Salter Innominate Osteotomy]]** | Cuts through ilium above acetabulum; rotates the entire acetabulum anteriorly and laterally. | 18 months – 6 years (Mobile pubic symphysis required). |
| | **[[Triple Innominate Osteotomy]]** (Steel) | Cuts ischium, pubis, and ilium to rotate the acetabulum. | Older children (skeletally immature) where symphysis is rigid. |
| **Reshaping** | **[[Pemberton Acetabuloplasty]]** | Cuts through ilium but hinges at the [[triradiate cartilage]] to reshape the roof. | Children with open triradiate cartilage (capacity to reshape). |
| | **[[Dega Osteotomy]]** | Similar to Pemberton but mainly posterior cut; often used in [[Cerebral Palsy]]. | Acetabular dysplasia with posterior deficiency. |
| **Salvage** | **[[Chiari Osteotomy]]** | Displacement osteotomy. The ilium is shifted medially to create a roof of cancellous bone over the head. | Incongruent hip, age > 8 years. |
| | **[[Shelf Operation]]** | Bone graft is slotted into the ilium to creating an extra-articular buttress. | Severe subluxation where reduction is impossible. |

**Clinical Implication:**
Salter and Pemberton osteotomies require a **concentric reduction** (congruent joint). If the hip cannot be concentrically reduced, a salvage procedure (Chiari/Shelf) is indicated.

#### 5. Adults / Neglected DDH
**Management Options**
*   **Supportive:** Analgesics, weight control, activity modification.
*   **[[Total Hip Arthroplasty]] (THR):** The definitive treatment for painful, neglected dysplasia with arthritis. Technical challenges include a shallow acetabulum (may need bone grafting) and narrow femoral canal.
*   **[[Arthrodesis]] (Fusion):** Rarely performed now; reserved for young manual laborers with unilateral disease.
