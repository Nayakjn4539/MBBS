# [[ENVIRONMENT & HEALTH]] > Enumerate the sources of air pollution. Name any four air pollutants. Describe the effects of air pollution. How air pollution can be controlled?

### **Sources of Air Pollution**

Air pollution signifies the presence of substances in the ambient atmosphere generated by human activities in concentrations that interfere with human health, safety, or comfort. The sources are broadly classified into:

**1. Automobiles**
*   This is the major source of air pollution in urban areas.
*   Vehicles emit **hydrocarbons**, [[carbon monoxide]], lead, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter.
*   Strong sunlight can convert hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides into "photochemical" pollutants.

**2. Industries**
*   Combustion of fuel to generate heat and power produces smoke, [[sulphur dioxide]], nitrogen oxides, and fly ash.
*   Petrochemical industries generate hydrogen fluoride, hydrochloric acid, and organic halides.
*   Discharge from high chimneys at high temperatures adds to atmospheric burden.

**3. Domestic Sources**
*   Domestic combustion of coal, wood, or oil is a major source of smoke, dust, [[sulphur dioxide]], and nitrogen oxides.
*   **Historical Note:** The London smog disaster (1952) was largely due to domestic coal burning.

**4. Tobacco Smoke**
*   The most direct and important source affecting the health of many people.
*   Includes **passive smoking** (inhaling smoke produced by others).

**5. Miscellaneous**
*   Burning refuse and incinerators.
*   Pesticide spraying.
*   Natural sources (wind-borne dust, fungi, molds, bacteria).
*   Nuclear energy programs.

### **Four Common Air Pollutants**

More than 100 substances have been identified as air pollutants. Four major ones are:

1.  **[[Carbon Monoxide]] (CO):** A product of incomplete combustion (automobiles, industries). It has a high affinity for hemoglobin (240 times that of oxygen).
2.  **[[Sulphur Dioxide]] (SO2):** Produced by burning coal and oil. It is the principal cause of **acid rain**.
3.  **Lead (Pb):** Emitted from automobiles using leaded petrol. It affects the nervous system, especially in children.
4.  **Particulate Matter (PM):** Complex mixture of organic and inorganic substances (soot, dust). PM less than 2.5 $\mu$m (**PM 2.5**) is dangerous as it reaches the alveoli.

### **Effects of Air Pollution**

The effects can be broadly classified into health aspects and social/economic aspects.

#### **A. Health Aspects**
Air pollution affects the respiratory and cardio-respiratory systems.

| **Effect Type** | **Consequences** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Immediate Effects** | • Acute bronchitis.<br>• Suffocation (can lead to death in severe cases, e.g., London Smog 1952).<br>• Irritation of eyes and throat (SO2). |
| **Delayed Effects** | • **Chronic bronchitis**.<br>• **[[Lung Cancer]]**: Due to carcinogens like benzpyrene.<br>• **Bronchial Asthma**.<br>• **Emphysema**.<br>• **Respiratory allergies**.<br>• **Lead Poisoning**: Impairs neuropsychological development in children (lower IQ). |

> **Clinical Relevance:**
> **Lead Poisoning (Plumbism):** Look for the **Burtonian Line** (Blue line on gums) and Basophilic stippling of RBCs on a blood smear. It causes wrist drop/foot drop (Lead palsy).

#### **B. Social and Economic Aspects**
*   **Destruction of plant and animal life:** Fluoride damage to fruit trees; Chlorosis (depigmented patches) in leaves.
*   **Corrosion of metals** and damage to buildings (e.g., discoloration of the Taj Mahal due to Mathura refinery pollution).
*   **Reduced visibility** in towns.
*   **Soiling** and damage to clothing.

#### **C. Global Environmental Effects**
*   **[[Greenhouse Effect]] (Global Warming):** Caused by CO2, methane, and CFCs trapping heat.
*   **Acid Rain:** Caused by SO2.
*   **Ozone Depletion:** Caused by Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).

### **Control of Air Pollution**

The WHO recommends the following five approaches for the prevention and control of air pollution:

**Mnemonic:** **C**ontrol **R**equires **D**iligent **L**egal **I**ntervention (**CR DLI**)

#### **1. Containment**
*   **Prevention of escape** of toxic substances into the ambient air.
*   Achieved by enclosure, ventilation, and air cleaning.
*   **Example:** Development of "arrestors" and electrostatic precipitators to remove contaminants before they leave the factory chimney.

#### **2. Replacement**
*   Replacing a technological process causing pollution with a new process that does not.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Using **electricity**, natural gas, or central heating instead of coal.
    *   Using **CNG** (Compressed Natural Gas) in vehicles instead of diesel/petrol.
    *   Use of **unleaded petrol** to prevent lead pollution.

#### **3. Dilution**
*   Valid only if the environment has the capacity to self-clean.
*   **Green Belts:** Establishment of vegetation and trees between industrial and residential areas. Vegetation absorbs certain pollutants (like CO2).
*   **Tall Chimneys:** Dispersing pollutants at higher altitudes to dilute their concentration near the ground.

#### **4. Legislation**
*   Enacting laws to control air pollution.
*   **The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981** in India.
*   Measures include controlling chimney heights, creating smokeless zones, and enforcing ambient air quality standards.

#### **5. International Action**
*   Pollution respects no geographical boundaries.
*   **WHO Network:** Establishment of international laboratories for monitoring and studying air pollution (e.g., in London, Washington, Moscow, Nagpur).
*   **Kyoto Protocol:** International treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
