# [[Pelvis And Hip]] > Management of Intracapsular Femoral Neck Fracture

# Management of Intracapsular Femoral Neck Fracture

### Introduction and Pathoanatomy
Intracapsular fractures of the [[femoral neck]] are true fractures occurring proximally to the intertrochanteric line, within the hip joint capsule,. These injuries present significant challenges due to the precarious blood supply and the lack of a cambium layer in the periosteum, leading to high rates of complications like [[avascular necrosis]] (AVN) and [[non-union]],.

**Vascular Anatomy Clinical Importance:**
The [[femoral head]] relies on three sources of blood:
1.  **Retinacular vessels** (Main source): Branches of the medial circumflex femoral artery.
2.  **Intraosseous cervical vessels**: Disrupted by the fracture.
3.  **Artery of Ligamentum Teres**: Supplies only a small portion.
*   **Clinical Implication:** In displaced fractures, the retinacular vessels are often kinked or torn, leading to ischemia. Therefore, anatomical reduction and fixation must be performed urgently in young patients to restore perfusion.

**Healing Potential:**
*   **Poor Healing:** The neck of the femur is bathed in [[synovial fluid]], which lyses the fracture hematoma (fibrinolysis). Additionally, the absence of the cambium layer prevents peripheral callus formation; healing relies solely on endosteal callus.

### Classification Systems
Classification guides treatment and prognosis.

#### 1. Garden’s Classification (Based on Displacement)
This is the most widely used classification for treatment planning,.
*   **Type I:** Incomplete or valgus impacted fracture.
*   **Type II:** Complete fracture but undisplaced.
*   **Type III:** Complete fracture with partial displacement (trabeculae do not line up).
*   **Type IV:** Complete fracture with full displacement (femoral head aligns with acetabulum but not the neck).

**Simplification for Management:**
*   **Undisplaced:** Garden I and II.
*   **Displaced:** Garden III and IV.

#### 2. Pauwel’s Classification (Based on Fracture Angle)
Predicts stability based on the angle of the fracture line relative to the horizontal.
*   **Type I:** < 30° (Most stable, compression forces aid healing).
*   **Type II:** 30°–50° (Shearing forces increase).
*   **Type III:** > 50° (Most unstable, high shearing force, high risk of non-union).

### Clinical Features and Diagnosis
*   **History:** Trivial trauma (slip and fall) in elderly; high-velocity trauma in young adults,.
*   **Symptoms:** Pain in the groin/hip, inability to bear weight.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Attitude:** Limb is in **external rotation** and **shortening**.
    *   *Note:* External rotation is usually less than 45° (unlike [[intertrochanteric fractures]] where it can be 90°) because the capsule is intact and limits rotation.
    *   **Tenderness:** Over the anterior hip joint line.
    *   **Active SLRT:** Unable to perform Active Straight Leg Raising Test.
*   **Imaging:** X-ray Pelvis with both hips (AP view) and cross-table lateral view of the affected hip.

### Management Algorithm
The treatment depends primarily on the **age of the patient** and the **displacement** of the fracture.

#### 1. Undisplaced/Impacted Fractures (Garden I & II)
*   **All Age Groups:** Internal Fixation is the gold standard to prevent displacement,.
    *   **Implant:** Multiple **Cannulated Cancellous Screws (CCS)**,.
    *   *Why fixation?* Even impacted fractures can disimpact and displace if left untreated.

#### 2. Displaced Fractures (Garden III & IV)
Treatment is strictly dictated by physiological age.

**A. Young Adults (< 60 Years)**
*   **Goal:** Preservation of the [[femoral head]] (Head Salvage),.
*   **Urgency:** This is a surgical emergency. Fixation should ideally be done within 6–12 hours to reduce the risk of AVN.
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  **Closed Reduction:** Gentle manipulation on a fracture table.
    2.  **Internal Fixation (CRIF):** Using 3 **Cannulated Cancellous Screws (7mm or 6.5mm)** in a triangular configuration,.
    3.  **Open Reduction (ORIF):** If closed reduction fails, open reduction (Watson-Jones approach) is required.
*   *Note:* In high-angle fractures (Pauwel’s Type III), a **Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS)** with an anti-rotation screw may be used for better stability,.

**B. Elderly Patients (> 60 Years)**
*   **Goal:** Early mobilization and avoidance of complications like non-union/AVN. The femoral head is sacrificed,.
*   **Procedure:** **Hemiarthroplasty** (Replacement of femoral head only).
    *   **Implants:**
        *   **Austin Moore Prosthesis (AMP):** Uncemented, used if calcar is sufficient,.
        *   **Thompson Prosthesis:** Cemented, used if calcar is deficient or in osteoporotic bone.
        *   **Bipolar Prosthesis:** Preferred in active elderly patients as it reduces erosion of the acetabulum.

**C. Very Old / Osteoarthritis / Rheumatoid Arthritis**
*   **Procedure:** **Total Hip Replacement (THR)**.
*   **Indication:** If the patient has pre-existing acetabular disease or is biologically fit with a high life expectancy.

| Parameter | Young Patient (<60 yrs) | Elderly Patient (>60 yrs) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Priority** | Save the Head | Early Mobilization |
| **Procedure** | CRIF / ORIF | Hemiarthroplasty / THR |
| **Implant** | Cannulated Screws (CCS) | Austin Moore / Bipolar / THR |
| **Complications** | AVN, Non-union | Dislocation, Loosening, Infection |

### Surgical Techniques

#### Internal Fixation with Cannulated Cancellous Screws (CCS)
*   **Reduction:** Done on a fracture table under C-arm guidance.
*   **Guide Wire:** Inserted through the lateral cortex, parallel to the neck, into the center of the head.
*   **Screw Placement:** Three screws are placed parallel to each other in a triangular pattern (one inferior, two superior) to resist rotation and bending. Threads must be completely beyond the fracture line to allow compression (lag effect).

#### Hemiarthroplasty (Austin Moore)
*   **Approach:** Posterior (Moore's) approach is common.
*   **Technique:** The head is extracted, neck is trimmed, and the medullary canal is rasped. The [[Austin Moore Prosthesis]] is inserted (press-fit). It has fenestrations for bone ingrowth.
*   **Rehabilitation:** Weight-bearing is allowed early (often next day).

### Complications
Intracapsular fractures are famously called "The Unsolved Fracture" due to these complications:

1.  **Non-Union:**
    *   **Incidence:** 20–30%.
    *   **Causes:** Poor blood supply, lack of cambium layer, synovial fluid washing away clot, imperfect reduction,.
    *   **Management:**
        *   *Elderly:* Hemiarthroplasty or THR.
        *   *Young:*
            *   **McMurray’s Osteotomy:** Displacement osteotomy (historical).
            *   **Pauwel’s Valgus Osteotomy:** Converts shearing forces into compression forces,.
            *   **Muscle Pedicle Bone Grafting:** (e.g., **Meyer's procedure** using Quadratus Femoris or **Baksi’s procedure**). Provides vascularity and osteogenic factors,.

2.  **Avascular Necrosis (AVN):**
    *   **Incidence:** 10–30%.
    *   **Mechanism:** Tearing of retinacular vessels or tamponade effect from intracapsular hematoma.
    *   **Diagnosis:** X-ray (late changes), **MRI** (Gold standard for early diagnosis).
    *   **Treatment:**
        *   *Early stages:* Core decompression (controversial).
        *   *Late stages/Collapse:* Total Hip Replacement (THR) or Arthrodesis,.

**Mnemonic for Complications:**
**A-N-D**
*   **A** - Avascular Necrosis
*   **N** - Non-union
*   **D** - Degenerative Arthritis (Secondary OA)
