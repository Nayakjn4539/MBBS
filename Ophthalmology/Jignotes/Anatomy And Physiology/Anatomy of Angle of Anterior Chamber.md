# Anatomy of Angle of Anterior Chamber

### Introduction
The [[Angle of Anterior Chamber]] (also known as the iridocorneal angle or filtration angle) is the peripheral recess of the anterior chamber where the cornea and the iris meet. It is a critical anatomical region responsible for the drainage of [[Aqueous Humour]]. Obstruction or malfunction in this area is the primary pathology in [[Glaucoma]].

### Boundaries and Relations
The anterior chamber is bounded:
*   **Anteriorly:** By the [[Cornea]].
*   **Posteriorly:** By the [[Iris]] and the anterior surface of the [[Crystalline Lens]].
*   **Peripherally (The Angle):** It is bounded anteriorly by the corneosclera (limbus) and posteriorly by the root of the iris and the anterior-most part of the ciliary body.

### Structures of the Angle
When viewed gonioscopically (from anterior to posterior), the following structures are visible:

#### 1. [[Schwalbe's Line]]
*   It represents the peripheral termination of [[Descemet's Membrane]] of the cornea.
*   It marks the anterior limit of the trabecular meshwork.
*   **Identification:** It appears as a glistening white line. It can be identified using the **Corneal Wedge** technique during gonioscopy, where the anterior and posterior corneal light reflexes meet at Schwalbe's line.
*   **Posterior Embryotoxon:** A prominent and anteriorly displaced Schwalbe's line is a congenital anomaly.

#### 2. [[Trabecular Meshwork]] (TM)
*   It is a circular sponge-work or sieve-like structure through which aqueous humour leaves the eye.
*   **Location:** Extending from [[Schwalbe's Line]] to the [[Scleral Spur]].
*   **Structure:** It consists of flattened bands of connective tissue lined by trabeculocytes.
*   **Divisions (From internal to external):**
    1.  **Uveal Meshwork:** The innermost part extending from the iris root/ciliary body to Schwalbe's line. It has large openings (25µ to 75µ) offering little resistance.
    2.  **Corneoscleral Meshwork:** The larger middle portion extending from the scleral spur to the lateral wall of the scleral sulcus. It has smaller elliptical openings (5µ-50µ).
    3.  **Juxtacanalicular (Endothelial) Meshwork:** The outermost portion adjacent to the inner wall of [[Schlemm's Canal]]. It consists of cells and ground substance. This layer offers the **maximum resistance** to aqueous outflow.

#### 3. [[Schlemm's Canal]]
*   An endothelial-lined oval channel situated circumferentially in the scleral sulcus.
*   **Inner Wall:** Lined by irregular endothelial cells containing **giant vacuoles**, which allow aqueous transport.
*   **Outer Wall:** Lined by smooth flat cells and contains openings for collector channels.

#### 4. [[Scleral Spur]]
*   A projection of the sclera that appears as a white line between the ciliary body band and the trabecular meshwork.
*   It serves as the anterior attachment site for the longitudinal muscle of the [[Ciliary Body]]. Contraction of the ciliary muscle pulls on the scleral spur, opening the trabecular meshwork spaces.

#### 5. [[Ciliary Body Band]] (CBB)
*   The anterior face of the ciliary body visible in the angle.
*   It appears as a gray or brown band located posterior to the scleral spur.
*   **Angle Recession:** A widening of the ciliary body band due to trauma (tearing between longitudinal and circular muscle fibers).

#### 6. [[Root of Iris]]
*   The peripheral insertion of the iris into the ciliary body.
*   **Iris Processes:** Fine extensions from the iris root may bridge the angle recess to attach to the trabecular meshwork.

### Aqueous Outflow Pathways
The angle is the primary site for aqueous humour drainage via two pathways:

| Pathway | Percentage | Mechanism | Route |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trabecular (Conventional)** | 70-90% | Pressure Dependent | AC $\rightarrow$ [[Trabecular Meshwork]] $\rightarrow$ [[Schlemm's Canal]] $\rightarrow$ Collector Channels $\rightarrow$ [[Episcleral Veins]] |
| **Uveoscleral (Unconventional)** | 10-30% | Pressure Independent | AC $\rightarrow$ [[Ciliary Body]] interstial spaces $\rightarrow$ Suprachoroidal space $\rightarrow$ Venous circulation of ciliary body/choroid/sclera |

### Clinical Evaluation: [[Gonioscopy]]
The angle cannot be visualized directly due to total internal reflection at the tear-air interface. A goniolens (contact lens with mirrors/prisms) is used to overcome this.

    *   **I**ris (Root)
    *   **C**iliary Body Band
    *   **S**cleral Spur
    *   **T**rabecular Meshwork
    *   **S**chwalbe's Line

**Grading Systems for Angle Width:**

#### 1. [[Shaffer's Grading System]]
Based on the angular width of the angle recess.

| Grade | Angle Width | Clinical Interpretation | Structures Visible |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Grade 4** | 35-45° | Wide Open (Closure Impossible) | SL, TM, SS, CBB |
| **Grade 3** | 20-35° | Open Angle (Closure Impossible) | SL, TM, SS |
| **Grade 2** | 20° | Moderately Narrow (Closure Possible) | SL, TM |
| **Grade 1** | 10° | Very Narrow (High Risk) | SL only |
| **Grade 0** | 0° | Closed | No structures (Iridocorneal contact) |

*(SL: Schwalbe's Line, TM: Trabecular Meshwork, SS: Scleral Spur, CBB: Ciliary Body Band)*

#### 2. [[Scheie's Grading System]]
Based on the visibility of angle structures.
*   **Grade I:** Wide open (All structures visible).
*   **Grade II:** Ciliary body band obscured.
*   **Grade III:** Posterior trabecular meshwork obscured.
*   **Grade IV:** Only Schwalbe's line visible (Closed).

### Clinical Implications
*   **[[Primary Open Angle Glaucoma]] (POAG):** The angle is open on gonioscopy, but there is resistance within the trabecular meshwork. Signs may include increased pigmentation of the TM (Sampaolesi line is pigment anterior to Schwalbe's line).
*   **[[Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma]] (PACG):** The iris apposes the trabecular meshwork, obstructing outflow. Gonioscopy is essential to visualize iridotrabecular contact (ITC).
*   **[[Trauma]]:** Blunt trauma can cause **Angle Recession** (widening of CBB) or **Iridodialysis** (disinsertion of iris root).
*   **[[Neovascularization]]:** New vessels in the angle (NVA) can lead to Neovascular Glaucoma.
