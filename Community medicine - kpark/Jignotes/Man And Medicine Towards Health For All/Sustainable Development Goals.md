# [[Man And Medicine: Towards Health For All]] > Sustainable Development Goals

### Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

The **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, officially known as "Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development," were adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in **September 2015**. They replaced the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) which concluded in 2015.

**Definition:** Sustainable development is defined as *"development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs"*.

#### The 5 Ps of the Agenda
The 2030 Agenda is centered around five key themes:
1.  **People:** End poverty and hunger; ensure dignity and equality.
2.  **Planet:** Protect the planet from degradation.
3.  **Prosperity:** Ensure prosperous and fulfilling lives.
4.  **Peace:** Foster peaceful, just, and inclusive societies.
5.  **Partnership:** Mobilize the means required to implement this agenda.

### SDG Goal 3: Ensure Healthy Lives and Promote Well-being for All at All Ages
This is the **primary health goal**. It includes **13 targets** (9 outcome targets + 4 means of implementation).

#### Targets and Indicators for Goal 3

| Target Area | Specific Target (By 2030 unless specified) | Key Indicators |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3.1 Maternal Mortality** | Reduce global [[Maternal Mortality Ratio]] (MMR) to less than **70 per 100,000 live births**. | MMR; Proportion of births attended by skilled personnel. |
| **3.2 Child Mortality** | End preventable deaths of newborns and under-5 children. <br> **Neonatal Mortality:** $\le$ **12** per 1,000 live births.<br> **Under-5 Mortality:** $\le$ **25** per 1,000 live births. | [[Under-5 Mortality Rate]]; [[Neonatal Mortality Rate]]. |
| **3.3 Communicable Diseases** | End epidemics of **AIDS**, **Tuberculosis**, **Malaria**, and [[Neglected Tropical Diseases]] (NTDs). Combat Hepatitis, water-borne diseases. | HIV incidence; TB incidence; Malaria incidence; Hepatitis B incidence. |
| **3.4 Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)** | Reduce by **one-third** premature mortality from [[Non-communicable Diseases]] (NCDs) via prevention and treatment. Promote mental health. | Mortality rate from CVD, cancer, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease; Suicide mortality rate. |
| **3.5 Substance Abuse** | Strengthen prevention and treatment of substance abuse (narcotics and harmful use of alcohol). | Treatment coverage for substance use disorders; Alcohol per capita consumption. |
| **3.6 Injuries** | Halve (**50%**) the number of global deaths and injuries from **road traffic accidents** (Target year was **2020**). | Death rate due to road traffic injuries. |

#### Means of Implementation Targets (3.a - 3.d)
*   **3.a:** Strengthen implementation of **WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control** (FCTC).
*   **3.b:** Support **R&D** of vaccines/medicines for diseases affecting developing countries; provide access to affordable essential medicines (Doha Declaration/TRIPS).

### Important Updates & New Indicators (2020)
New indicators were added to monitor progress more effectively:
*   **Anaemia:** Prevalence in women of reproductive age.
*   **HPV Vaccine:** Coverage of HPV vaccine (Target 3.b).
*   **Essential Medicines:** Availability and affordability in PHC settings.
*   **Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR):** Bloodstream infections (e.g., *E. coli*, MRSA) and antibiotic consumption.

### SDGs vs. MDGs
*   **Scope:** MDGs were focused on developing countries; SDGs are **universal** and apply to all countries.
*   **Focus:** MDGs focused on specific disease outcomes; SDGs focus on **sustainability**, **equity** ("Leaving no one behind"), and broad determinants like [[Universal Health Coverage]].
*   **Integration:** SDGs integrate economic, social, and environmental pillars of development.

### India and SDGs
*   **NITI Aayog** is the nodal agency for coordinating SDGs in India.
*   Government motto **"Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas"** aligns with the SDG principle of leaving no one behind.
*   **Health Index of India:** A weighted composite index by NITI Aayog to measure state performance on health outcomes, closely linked to SDG targets.
