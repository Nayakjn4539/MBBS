# Speech Therapy in Laryngology

[[Speech therapy]] is a non-invasive, behavioral treatment modality used to treat voice disorders ([[Dysphonia]]), optimize laryngeal function, and rehabilitate patients following laryngeal surgery. It is often the first line of management for functional disorders and early organic lesions.

### General Principles of Voice Therapy
The primary goals are to optimize the efficiency of voice production, minimize counterproductive compensations (e.g., excessive muscle tension), and educate patients about their underlying voice disorder.

**Components of Voice Therapy:**
*   **Vocal Hygiene:** Education on lifestyle changes to protect the mucosa.
*   **Direct Voice Therapy:** Specific exercises to alter vocal fold contact, breath support, and resonance.
*   **Psychological Support:** Addressing stress and anxiety related to voice loss.

### 1. Vocal Hygiene (Voice Care)
Strict adherence to vocal hygiene is essential for the resolution of inflammatory pathology and prevention of recurrence.

*   **Hydration:** Drink up to 2 liters of water daily to maintain mucosal lubrication.
*   **Voice Rest:**
    *   **Absolute Voice Rest:** Recommended for 48 hours after phonosurgery.
    *   **Relative Voice Rest:** Avoid shouting, screaming, and whispering (whispering causes forced adduction and strain).
*   **Avoid Irritants:** Cessation of [[Smoking]] and avoidance of alcohol (especially spirits) and spicy foods.
*   **Lubrication:** Steam inhalation and sipping ice-cold water to stop throat clearing,.
*   **Reflux Management:** Control of [[Laryngopharyngeal Reflux]] (LPR) via diet and PPIs.

### 2. Speech Therapy for Structural Lesions

#### A. [[Vocal Nodules]] (Singer's/Screamer's Nodules)
*   **Status:** First-line treatment,.
*   **Mechanism:** Early nodules often regress completely with voice rest and speech re-education.
*   **Post-operative:** If surgery ([[Microlaryngeal Surgery]]) is required for hard/fibrotic nodules, post-operative therapy is mandatory to prevent recurrence by correcting faulty vocal habits,.

#### B. [[Vocal Polyps]]
*   **Status:** Adjuvant treatment.
*   **Management:** Usually require surgical excision (MLS) as they rarely regress with therapy alone. Speech therapy is given *post-operatively* to correct the underlying voice abuse that caused the polyp,.

#### C. [[Reinke's Edema]]
*   **Status:** Adjuvant.
*   **Management:** Cessation of smoking is the primary step. Voice therapy helps in pre-operative optimization and post-operative rehabilitation after reduction glottoplasty,.

#### D. [[Contact Ulcer]] / [[Arytenoid Granuloma]]
*   **Status:** Primary or Adjuvant.
*   **Management:** Therapy focuses on stopping "throat clearing" habits and raising the pitch to reduce impact on the vocal processes. Often combined with anti-reflux medication.

### 3. Speech Therapy for Neurological/Paralytic Conditions

#### A. Unilateral [[Vocal Cord Palsy]]
*   **Status:** First-line (for temporary/idiopathic cases) or Adjuvant.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   Strengthens the laryngeal musculature.
    *   Teaches the **healthy vocal cord** to cross the midline (compensate) to meet the paralyzed cord, thereby closing the glottic gap,.
    *   Prevents muscle atrophy during the observation period (6–12 months) for idiopathic palsy.
*   **Outcome:** If the glottic gap is large or aspiration is severe, surgical medialization ([[Thyroplasty]] Type I) is indicated, followed by therapy.

#### B. [[Spasmodic Dysphonia]]
*   **Status:** Adjuvant/Supportive.
*   **Adductor Type:** Speech therapy alone is usually *ineffective*. The gold standard is **Botulinum Toxin ([[Botox]])** injection into the thyroarytenoid muscle. Therapy helps prolong the effect of Botox and manage compensatory behaviors,.
*   **Abductor Type:** Less responsive to Botox; therapy plays a larger role but has limited success.

### 4. Speech Therapy for Functional Disorders
Functional disorders have no organic cause and are diagnoses of exclusion. Speech therapy is the **mainstay of treatment**.

| Disorder | Definition | Management |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Puberphonia]]** (Mutational Falsetto) | Persistence of high-pitched childhood voice in an adult male despite normal laryngeal growth. | **Voice Therapy (TOC):** Teaches the patient to produce a low tone. <br> **[[Gutzmann's Pressure Test]]:** Pressing the thyroid prominence backward and downward relaxes overstretched cords to produce a low tone; used to demonstrate the "true" voice to the patient,. |
| **[[Functional Aphonia]]** (Hysterical Aphonia) | Patient speaks only in whispers; vocal cords remain abducted during speech but adduct on coughing/laughing. | **Psychotherapy & Voice Therapy:** Reassurance is key. The patient is shown that cords *can* adduct (via cough) and is taught to phonate,. |
| **[[Muscle Tension Dysphonia]]** (MTD) | Hyperfunction of laryngeal muscles due to stress/anxiety; painful speaking. | **Laryngeal Massage & Relaxation:** Exercises to reduce supralaryngeal tension. Vocal hygiene. |
| **[[Dysphonia Plica Ventricularis]]** | Voice production by false vocal cords (ventricular bands); rough, low-pitched voice. | **Re-education:** Training to relax false cords and engage true cords. Psychotherapy if functional. |

### 5. Speech Rehabilitation Following Total [[Laryngectomy]]
After Total Laryngectomy, the patient loses the natural voice source. Rehabilitation is crucial for communication.

> flowchart comparing the three methods of alaryngeal speech

#### A. [[Esophageal Speech]]
*   **Mechanism:** Patient swallows air, holds it in the upper esophagus, and ejects it back out. The **pharyngo-esophageal segment (PE segment)** vibrates to produce sound,.
*   **Pros:** No device needed, hands-free, no cost.
*   **Cons:** Difficult to learn (high failure rate), low volume, short phonation duration (6–10 words per breath).

#### B. [[Tracheoesophageal Puncture]] (TEP) Speech
*   **Mechanism:** A one-way valve (Voice Prosthesis, e.g., **Blom-Singer** or **Panje**) is placed between the trachea and esophagus. To speak, the patient occludes the stoma; exhaled air from lungs is shunted into the esophagus, vibrating the PE segment,.
*   **Pros:** Uses lung air (long phonation time), loud voice, most natural sounding, easy to learn. **Gold Standard** for restoration.
*   **Cons:** Requires manual occlusion (finger) or a valve, risk of leakage/aspiration if valve fails, ongoing cost of prosthesis maintenance.

#### C. [[Electrolarynx]] (Artificial Larynx)
*   **Mechanism:** An external battery-operated vibrating device is held against the neck (or cheek). Vibrations are transmitted to the pharynx and articulated into speech by the tongue/lips,.
*   **Pros:** Easy to use immediately post-op, useful if TEP fails.
*   **Cons:** Robotic/mechanical sound, one hand is occupied, socially less acceptable.

### 6. Assessment Tools in Speech Therapy
Before starting therapy, baseline assessment is required:
1.  **Perceptual Analysis:** **GRBAS Scale** (Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, Strain).
2.  **Subjective Analysis:** **VHI-10** (Voice Handicap Index) to assess quality of life impact.
3.  **Visualization:** **[[Videostroboscopy]]** to assess mucosal wave and glottic closure.
4.  **Acoustic Analysis:** Measuring Jitter (pitch perturbation) and Shimmer (loudness perturbation).

### Clinical Implications
*   **[[Bernoulli's Principle]]:** Understanding aerodynamics is crucial for therapy; airflow velocity increases at the glottic constriction, creating negative pressure that adducts cords.
*   **Professional Voice Users:** Teachers and singers require specialized rehabilitation to prevent career-ending injuries (e.g., nodules).
*   **Post-Thyroidectomy:** Therapy is vital for patients with unilateral RLN palsy to prevent muscle atrophy while waiting for potential neural recovery.

**Mnemonic for Voice Hygiene:** **WISH**
*   **W**ater (Hydration)
*   **I**rritants (Avoid smoke/alcohol)
*   **S**ilence (Voice rest when inflamed)
*   **H**ealth (Treat reflux/allergy)
