# [[Cardiac Poisons]] > Oleander

### **Oleander Poisoning (Nerium and Thevetia)**

Oleander refers to two distinct but related poisonous plants belonging to the family *Apocynaceae*. Both act as powerful [[Cardiac Poisons]] due to the presence of cardiac glycosides.

### **1. Classification and Botanical Features**

| Feature | **Nerium Odorum / Indicum** | **Cerbera Thevetia / Thevetia Neriifolia** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Common Name** | White/Pink Oleander (Kaner) | Yellow Oleander (Pila Kaner) / Lucky Nut |
| **Flowers** | Pink or white; sweet smelling. | Yellow, bell-shaped (trumpet like). |
| **Leaves** | Dark green, narrow, lanceolate, thick. | Linear, lanceolate, shiny. |
| **Fruit/Seeds** | Follicle containing seeds with brown hair tufts. | Green globular fruit (resembles **unripe mango** or fig); seed is triangular/hemispherical. |
| **Active Principles** | **[[Oleandrin]]**, **[[Nerin]]**, Folinerin, Rosagenin. | **[[Thevetin]]**, **[[Cerberin]]**, Thevetoxin, Peruvoside, Ruvoside. |
| **Toxicity** | All parts are poisonous (Root > Seeds > Leaves). | All parts are poisonous (Seeds > Root > Leaves). |

> **Note:** [[Cerbera odollam]] is a related species found in South India (Kerala) with fruits resembling green mangoes; known as a suicide poison.

### **2. Mechanism of Action**
These plants contain **Cardiac Glycosides** (similar to [[Digitalis]]).
*   **Action:** They inhibit the **[[Na+-K+ ATPase pump]]** in the cardiac muscle fibers.
*   **Effect:** This leads to an increase in intracellular Sodium and Calcium.
*   **Result:** Increased myocardial contractility (positive inotropic) and increased excitability, eventually leading to conduction defects and [[Arrhythmias]].

---

### **3. Clinical Features (Signs and Symptoms)**
Symptoms usually appear within **1 to 2 hours** of ingestion.

**A. Gastrointestinal (Early Signs)**
*   Bitter taste in mouth.
*   Nausea and excessive vomiting (vomitus may contain plant parts).
*   Abdominal pain and diarrhea.
*   Salivation and difficulty in swallowing.

**B. Cardiovascular (Dominant)**
*   **[[Bradycardia]]** (Pulse may drop as low as 30–40/min).
*    hypotension.
*   **Arrhythmias:** Extra-systoles, AV block, Ventricular tachycardia, or Ventricular fibrillation.
*   [[Hyperkalemia]] is a significant risk and marker of toxicity.

**C. Central Nervous System**
*   Dizziness, drowsiness, and headache.
*   Dilated pupils (non-reactive to light).
*   **[[Hippus]]**: Rarely seen (alternating contraction and dilatation of pupils).
*   Confusion, delirium, coma, and convulsions (terminal).

**D. Dermal**
*   Contact with sap may cause contact dermatitis or blistering.

### **4. Fatal Dose and Fatal Period**

| Poison | Fatal Dose | Fatal Period |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nerium (White)** | 15–20 g of root; 8–10 seeds. | 24 hours (approx). |
| **Thevetia (Yellow)** | 8–10 seeds; 15–20 g of root; 5–15 leaves. | 2 to 3 hours (variable). |

---

### **5. Diagnosis**
*   **History:** Ingestion of seeds or decoction.
*   **ECG:** ST-segment depression (scooping), PR prolongation, AV blocks.
*   **Laboratory:** Radioimmunoassay (RIA) or Fluorescence Polarization Immunoassay (FPIA) can detect glycosides. [[Hyperkalemia]] is a key diagnostic clue.

---

### **6. Treatment**
**A. Decontamination**
*   **[[Gastric Lavage]]**: Should be done carefully with activated charcoal or weak tannins (strong tea).
*   **Cathartics**: To hasten elimination.

**B. Specific Antidote**
*   **[[Digoxin-specific antibody fragments]] (Fab fragments/Digibind):** Highly effective for both Digitalis and Oleander poisoning. It neutralizes the circulating glycosides.
    *   **Indication:** Life-threatening arrhythmias, severe hyperkalemia (>5 mEq/L).
    *   **Dose:** Empirically 10–20 vials if the dose ingested is unknown.

**C. Symptomatic Management**
*   **Bradycardia:** [[Atropine]] (0.6 mg IV) or temporary cardiac pacing.
*   **Ventricular Arrhythmias:** [[Lignocaine]] or Phenytoin.
*   **Hyperkalemia:** Treat with Glucose + Insulin or Sodium Bicarbonate. **Avoid Calcium Gluconate** (calcium synergizes toxicity causing "stone heart").
*   **Magnesium:** MgSO4 may be beneficial for arrhythmias.

### **7. Postmortem Findings**
*   **General:** No specific signs; findings of asphyxia may be present.
*   **GI Tract:** Mucosa of stomach and duodenum shows congestion, inflammation, or ecchymosis. Plant parts (seeds/leaves) may be identified.
*   **Heart:** **[[Subendocardial hemorrhages]]** (petechiae) especially in the Left Ventricle.
*   **Viscera:** General congestion of liver, kidneys, and lungs.

---

### **8. Medicolegal Aspects**
*   **Suicide:** Most common manner of death. Seeds are crushed or pastes made from roots are ingested. Popular in rural South India.
*   **Accidental:** Common in children who mistake the fruit/seeds for edible nuts. Also seen when quacks use plant extracts for medicinal purposes (e.g., abortifacient).
*   **Homicide:** Rare due to bitter taste, but historical cases exist.
*   **Cattle Poison:** Leaves or roots are sometimes used to poison cattle.
*   **Abortifacient:** Paste applied on abortion sticks or consumed.

### **Mnemonics**

**"YELLOW"** (For Yellow Oleander features)
*   **Y**ellow flowers (Bell shaped)
*   **E**CG changes (Block/Arrhythmia)
*   **L**ucky nut (Seeds)
*   **L**ike Digitalis (Action)
*   **O**leandrin / **W**hite Oleander (Related species)

**"DIG"** (Treatment)
*   **D**igibind (Antidote)
*   **I**ncreased Potassium (Hyperkalemia)
*   **G**astric Lavage
