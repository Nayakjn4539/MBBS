# Amoebiasis

**Definition:**
[[Community Medicine/Jignotes/COMMUNICABLE DISEASES/Amoebiasis]] is defined as the condition of harbouring the protozoan parasite **[[Entamoeba histolytica]]** with or without clinical manifestations,. It is a major public health problem, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions with poor sanitation.

### **1. Epidemiological Determinants**

#### **A. Agent Factors**
*   **Causative Agent:** *Entamoeba histolytica*.
    *   It must be distinguished from non-pathogenic strains like *E. coli* or *E. hartmanni*.
*   **Forms of the Parasite:**
    1.  **Trophozoite (Vegetative form):** Invasive form found in tissues and fluid feces. It is short-lived outside the body.
    2.  **Cyst (Infective form):** Found in formed stools. These are resistant to harsh conditions and are responsible for transmission,.
*   **Resistance:** Cysts can survive for weeks in moisture. **Important:** Cysts are **not** killed by chlorine in amounts used for standard water purification but are killed by drying or heating (>55°C),.
*   **Reservoir:** **[[Man]]** is the only known reservoir (cases and asymptomatic cyst passers),.
*   **Period of Communicability:** As long as cysts are excreted, which can persist for years.

#### **B. Host Factors**
*   **Susceptibility:** General; no sex or racial difference in infection rates.
*   **Clinical Disease:** Symptomatic disease (e.g., liver abscess) is more frequent in adult males.
*   **Immunity:** Cell-mediated immunity plays a role in controlling recurrence.

#### **C. Environmental Factors**
*   Closely related to **poor sanitation**, low socio-economic status, and the use of nightsoil for agriculture,.
*   Infection rates often increase during rains due to prolonged cyst survival and water contamination.

### **2. Modes of Transmission**

| Mode | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fecal-Oral Route** | Ingestion of water, food, or vegetables contaminated with feces containing cysts,. |
| **Sexual Transmission** | Oral-rectal contact, particularly among homosexual men,. |
| **Vectors** | Flies, cockroaches, and rodents can mechanically transport cysts to food,. |
| **Hands/Fingers** | Direct hand-to-mouth transmission via contaminated fingers/nails. |

### **3. Clinical Features**

**Incubation Period:** Commonly **2 to 4 weeks** (range: days to years),.

**A. Intestinal Amoebiasis:**
*   **Amoebic Dysentery:** Slower onset than bacillary dysentery. Stools are bulky, offensive, and contain mixed blood and mucus.
*   **Amoebic Colitis:** Thickening of the cecum and sigmoid colon.

**B. Extra-intestinal Amoebiasis:**
*   **[[Amoebic Liver Abscess]]:** The most common extra-intestinal manifestation. May be suppurative or non-suppurative.
*   **Rare sites:** Lung, brain, spleen, or skin,.

### **4. Laboratory Diagnosis**

*   **Stool Examination:**
    *   **Diagnostic feature:** Presence of **trophozoites containing RBCs** (erythrophagocytosis) in freshly passed mucus/stool,.
    *   Cysts are found in solid stools (carriers).
*   **Serology:**
    *   Useful for extra-intestinal amoebiasis (liver abscess) where stool exams may be negative.
    *   **IHA (Indirect Hemagglutination)** is considered the most sensitive test,.
    *   ELISA and IFA are also used.

### **5. Prevention and Control**

**Primary Prevention:**
1.  **Sanitation:** Safe disposal of human excreta (Sanitation Barrier).
2.  **Water Safety:**
    *   Since chlorination is ineffective against cysts, **Sand Filtration** or **Boiling** is required,.
    *   **Household purification:** Diatomaceous earth filters.
3.  **Food Hygiene:** Washing uncooked vegetables/fruits with detergent or soaking in **acetic acid/vinegar** (5-10%),.
4.  **Health Education:** Hand washing and proper food handling.

**Secondary Prevention:**
*   Early diagnosis and prompt treatment to interrupt transmission.

### **6. Treatment**

**Mnemonic for Treatment:** **M**etronidazole **T**reats **I**nvasive, **D**iloxanide **C**lears **C**ysts.

| Clinical State | Drug of Choice | Dosage/Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Symptomatic / Invasive** (Acute Dysentery/ Liver Abscess) | **[[Metronidazole]]** or Tinidazole | 30 mg/kg/day divided in 3 doses for 8-10 days. |
| **Asymptomatic / Cyst Passers** | **[[Diloxanide furoate]]** or Diiodohydroxyquin | Diloxanide: 500 mg TDS for 10 days (Adults). |

*Clinical Relevance:* Even after treating invasive disease with Metronidazole, a course of a luminal amoebicide (like Diloxanide furoate) is often recommended to clear the carrier state (cysts) from the intestine.
