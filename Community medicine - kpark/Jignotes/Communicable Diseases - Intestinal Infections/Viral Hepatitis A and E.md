# Viral Hepatitis A and E (Enteric Hepatitis)

Both Hepatitis A and Hepatitis E are transmitted primarily through the **fecal-oral route** and are distinct from serum hepatitis (B, C, D) which are blood-borne. They usually cause acute self-limiting disease and do **not** lead to chronic carrier states or chronic liver disease.

### 1. Viral Hepatitis A (Infectious Hepatitis)

An acute infectious disease characterized by fever, anorexia, and jaundice, formerly known as "Infectious Hepatitis". It is often a disease of childhood in developing countries.

*   **Agent Factor:**
    *   **Agent:** [[Hepatitis A Virus (HAV)]]. It is an **Enterovirus type 72** belonging to the *Picornaviridae* family (RNA virus).
    *   **Resistance:** The virus is resistant to heat (56°C for 30 mins) and acid. It survives for weeks in water and shellfish.
    *   **Inactivation:** It is inactivated by boiling for 5 minutes, autoclaving, or ultraviolet rays. [[Chlorination]] requires a higher concentration/contact time (1 mg/L free residual chlorine for 30 mins) to kill HAV compared to bacteria.

*   **Reservoir & Host:**
    *   **Reservoir:** **Humans** are the only reservoir (Cases only).
    *   **Carrier State:** **No chronic carrier state** exists.
    *   **Infective Material:** Feces (primary), blood (briefly during viremia).
    *   **Host:** Affects all ages, but most frequent in **children**. In children, the infection is often **subclinical** (anicteric), while adults usually develop clinical jaundice.
    *   **Immunity:** Infection confers lifelong immunity.

*   **Transmission:**
    *   **Route:** [[Fecal-oral route]] is the major route.
    *   **Direct:** Person-to-person via contaminated hands (fecal contamination).
    *   **Indirect:** Vehicle-borne via contaminated **water, food, and milk** (common source epidemics).
    *   **Sexual:** Oral-anal contact (MSM).

*   **Incubation Period:**
    *   **10 to 50 days** (Average: **25–30 days** or 2–6 weeks).

*   **Period of Communicability:**
    *   Maximum infectivity is during the latter half of the incubation period.
    *   Risk is greatest from **2 weeks before to 1 week after** the onset of jaundice.

*   **Clinical Picture:**
    1.  **Pre-icteric Phase:** Fever, chills, headache, fatigue, and distinct **anorexia** (loss of appetite), nausea/vomiting.
    2.  **Icteric Phase:** Dark urine and yellow discoloration of sclera (jaundice). The fever usually subsides as jaundice appears.
    *   *Prognosis:* Generally benign; complete recovery in 98% of cases. Case fatality is low (<0.1%).

*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   **Acute Infection:** Detection of **IgM anti-HAV** antibody (appears early, persists for 3-6 months).
    *   **Past Infection/Immunity:** Detection of **IgG anti-HAV** (persists for decades/life).

*   **Treatment:**
    *   No specific antiviral drug. Treatment is supportive (rest, adequate fluid/nutrition).

*   **Prevention:**
    *   **Sanitation:** Sanitary disposal of excreta and purification of community water.
    *   **Vaccine:** [[Hepatitis A Vaccine]].
        *   **Types:** Formaldehyde Inactivated (e.g., Havrix) or Live Attenuated (H2 strain).
        *   **Schedule:** 2 doses given 6 months apart (Inactivated).
    *   **Immunoglobulin:** Human normal immunoglobulin (0.02 ml/kg) can provide temporary passive immunity (3-5 months) for travelers or post-exposure prophylaxis (within 14 days).

### 2. Viral Hepatitis E (Enterically Transmitted Non-A Non-B)

Hepatitis E is essentially a water-borne disease that causes large-scale epidemics in developing countries. It is biologically similar to Hep A but epidemiologically different regarding age groups and pregnancy risks.

*   **Agent Factor:**
    *   **Agent:** [[Hepatitis E Virus (HEV)]]. It is an RNA virus (Calcivirus/Hepevirus family).
    *   **Genotypes:** Genotype 1 causes epidemics in developing countries (human only).

*   **Reservoir & Host:**
    *   **Reservoir:** Man.
    *   **Age Group:** Unlike Hep A, the attack rate is highest in **young adults (15–40 years)**. Cases are uncommon in children.

*   **Transmission:**
    *   Primarily **water-borne** (sewage contamination of drinking water).
    *   Person-to-person spread is minimal compared to Hep A.

*   **Incubation Period:**
    *   **15 to 64 days** (Average: **40 days** or 2–9 weeks).

*   **Clinical Picture:**
    *   Similar to Hepatitis A (acute self-limiting).
    *   **[[Clinical Relevance]]:** **Pregnancy** is a major risk factor. HEV infection in the **3rd trimester** of pregnancy has a high case fatality rate (**20–25%**) due to **Fulminant Hepatic Failure**.

*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   Detection of **IgM anti-HEV** or HEV RNA by RT-PCR.

*   **Prevention:**
    *   Strict control of water sanitation.
    *   Vaccines are developed (e.g., in China) but not widely available globally yet.

### Comparison: Hepatitis A vs Hepatitis E

| Feature | Hepatitis A (HAV) | Hepatitis E (HEV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Family** | Picornaviridae (Enterovirus 72) | Calcivirus / Hepeviridae |
| **Transmission** | Fecal-oral (Direct contact > Water) | Fecal-oral (**Water-borne**) |
| **Age Group** | **Children** (often asymptomatic) | **Young Adults** (15-40 yrs) |
| **Incubation** | 2-6 weeks | 2-9 weeks |
| **Chronicity** | None | None (Rarely in immunosuppressed) |
| **Pregnancy Risk** | Mild | **High Mortality (Fulminant Hepatitis)** |
| **Prevention** | Vaccine Available | Sanitation (Vaccine limited) |

### Mnemonics for Exam

*   **"The Vowels affect the Bowels"**: Hepatitis **A** and **E** are transmitted via the fecal-oral route (bowels).
