# [[DEMOGRAPHY AND FAMILY PLANNING]] > A 25-year-old mother with 2 children aged 5 years and 1 year has come to the OPD for family planning advice. Discuss different methods of contraception to the mother with merits and demerits. Enumerate the fertility indicators. What do you mean by NRR 1?

### **Case Discussion: Family Planning & Fertility Indicators**

**Case Profile:**
*   **Age:** 25 years (highly fertile age group).
*   **Parity:** $\text{P}_2$ (One child 5 years old, one child 1 year old).
*   **Status:** The youngest child is 1 year old; thus, the mother is likely out of the exclusive breastfeeding period. She is an [[Eligible Couple]] requiring effective contraception.

### **1. Contraceptive Advice for the Mother**

The approach to contraception must be the **[[Cafeteria Approach]]**, where the mother is offered choices based on her reproductive goals (spacing vs. limiting). Since she is young (25 years) but has two children, she may choose either a long-term spacing method or a permanent method if her family is complete.

#### **A. Intra-Uterine Contraceptive Devices (IUCDs)**
This is often the **best spacing method** for a woman with one or more children.
*   **Type:** [[Cu-T 380A]] (effective for 10 years) or Multiload 375 (effective for 5 years).
*   **Merits:**
    *   Long-term protection without daily attention.
    *   High efficacy (Success rate ~97-99%).
    *   **Reversibility:** Fertility returns almost immediately after removal.
    *   Non-hormonal (no systemic metabolic side effects).
*   **Demerits:**
    *   **Menstrual problems:** Heavy bleeding (menorrhagia) and pain are common reasons for removal.
    *   Risk of expulsion or displacement.
    *   Increased risk of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) if rigorous asepsis is not followed during insertion.

> **Clinical Relevance:** The [[MEC Wheel]] (Medical Eligibility Criteria) by WHO places IUCD as Category 1 (No restriction) for this patient unless she has active PID or unexplained vaginal bleeding.

#### **B. Oral Contraceptive Pills (OCPs)**
Combined pills (e.g., [[Mala-N]], Mala-D) containing Ethinyl Estradiol + Levonorgestrel.
*   **Merits:**
    *   Almost 100% effective if taken regularly.
    *   **Non-contraceptive benefits:** Reduces risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer, regulates menstrual cycles, reduces anemia (less menstrual loss).
*   **Demerits:**
    *   **Compliance:** Requires daily motivation (pill burden).
    *   Side effects: Nausea, weight gain, breast tenderness, headache.
    *   Metabolic effects: Can alter lipid profile or elevate BP (rare in young healthy women).

#### **C. Injectable Contraceptives (Antara/DMPA)**
Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate given IM every 3 months.
*   **Merits:**
    *   Highly effective and private (coitus independent).
    *   Good for women who cannot take estrogens.
    *   Protects against endometrial cancer.
*   **Demerits:**
    *   **Disruption of menstrual cycle:** Irregular spotting or amenorrhea (very common).
    *   **Delayed return of fertility:** Conception may be delayed by 6–12 months after stopping.
    *   Decrease in bone mineral density with long-term use.

#### **D. Barrier Methods (Condoms)**
*   **Merits:**
    *   Only method providing dual protection against **Pregnancy** and **[[STIs/HIV]]**.
    *   No side effects.
*   **Demerits:**
    *   High failure rate due to user dependency (2–14 per 100 women-years).
    *   Requires interruption of sexual activity.

#### **E. Terminal Method (Tubectomy)**
If the couple decides their family is complete (2 children).
*   **Merits:**
    *   Permanent, one-time procedure.
    *   Very high efficacy.
    *   No long-term recurring costs.
*   **Demerits:**
    *   Surgical risks (though minimal with Laparoscopic ligation).
    *   **Irreversibility:** Reversal is difficult and expensive; regret is higher if sterilization is done at a young age (<30 years).

| **Method** | **Ideal Candidate** | **Key Advantage** | **Major Disadvantage** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IUCD** | Parous women wanting spacing | Long-acting, forgettable | Menorrhagia |
| **OCP** | Disciplined user | Regular cycles, Cancer protection | Daily intake needed |
| **Injectables** | Lactating or OCP contraindicated | Discrete, 3-monthly | Amenorrhea, delayed fertility |
| **Sterilization** | Family complete | Permanent | Surgical risk, Regret |

### **2. Enumeration of Fertility Indicators**

Fertility is the actual bearing of children. These indicators measure the rate at which people are added to the population through births.

1.  **[[Birth Rate]] (Crude Birth Rate - CBR):** Simplest indicator. Live births per 1000 mid-year population.
2.  **[[General Fertility Rate]] (GFR):** Live births per 1000 women in the reproductive age group (15–49 years). It is a better measure than CBR.
3.  **General Marital Fertility Rate (GMFR):** Live births per 1000 *married* women in the reproductive age group.
4.  **Age-Specific Fertility Rate (ASFR):** Live births in a year to 1000 women in any specified age group (e.g., 20–24 years).
5.  **[[Total Fertility Rate]] (TFR):** The average number of children a woman would have if she were to pass through her reproductive years bearing children at the same rates as the women now in each age group. *(Current TFR India ~ 2.0)*.
6.  **Gross Reproduction Rate (GRR):** Average number of *daughters* born to a woman assuming no mortality.
7.  **Net Reproduction Rate (NRR):** (Explained below).
8.  **Child-Woman Ratio:** Number of children (0–4 years) per 1000 women of childbearing age.
9.  **Pregnancy Rate:** Ratio of number of pregnancies to married women in reproductive age.
10. **Abortion Rate/Ratio.**

### **3. NRR 1 (Net Reproduction Rate = 1)**

**Definition of NRR:**
[[Net Reproduction Rate]] (NRR) is defined as the number of **daughters** a newborn girl will bear during her lifetime, assuming fixed age-specific fertility and mortality rates. Unlike GRR, **NRR takes into account that some females will die before or during their childbearing years.**

**Meaning of NRR = 1:**
*   **Replacement Level Fertility:** It implies that each generation of mothers is exactly replacing itself.
*   **Demographic Significance:** When NRR = 1, a woman bears exactly one daughter (who survives to childbearing age) to replace her.
*   **Population Stabilization:** Attaining NRR = 1 does not mean immediate zero population growth. Due to the "momentum of population," the population will continue to grow for some years before stabilizing.
*   **Targets:**
    *   NRR = 1 is equivalent to attaining the **2-Child Norm**.
    *   It roughly corresponds to a **TFR of 2.1**.
    *   Demographers believe NRR = 1 can be achieved only if the **[[Couple Protection Rate]] (CPR) exceeds 60%**.
