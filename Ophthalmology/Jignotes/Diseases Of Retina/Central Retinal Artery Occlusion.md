# [[Diseases Of Retina]] > Central Retinal Artery Occlusion

### **Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)**

**Definition**
[[Central Retinal Artery Occlusion]] (CRAO) is an ocular emergency characterized by the blockage of the central retinal artery, usually at the level of the [[lamina cribrosa]]. It results in acute ischemia of the inner layers of the retina.

### **Etiopathogenesis**
The central retinal artery is a branch of the [[ophthalmic artery]]. Occlusion typically occurs due to:
1.  **Atherosclerosis:** Atherosclerosis-related thrombosis at the lamina cribrosa is a common cause.
2.  **Embolism:** This is a frequent cause. The types of emboli include:
    *   **Cholesterol emboli ([[Hollenhorst plaques]]):** Refractile, orange plaques arising from the carotid arteries.
    *   **Calcific emboli:** White, non-refractile emboli arising from cardiac valves.
    *   **Platelet-fibrin emboli:** Dull white emboli.
3.  **Giant Cell Arteritis ([[GCA]]):** An inflammatory cause requiring urgent systemic evaluation.
4.  **Other Causes:**
    *   Raised [[intraocular pressure]] (e.g., tight encirclage in RD surgery).
    *   Thrombophilic disorders (e.g., in young individuals).
    *   Retinal migraine (angiospasm).

### **Clinical Features**
**Symptoms**
*   **Sudden, painless, profound loss of vision** in one eye.
*   History of **[[Amaurosis Fugax]]** (transient visual loss resembling a curtain falling) may precede the permanent occlusion.

**Signs**
1.  **Visual Acuity:** Markedly reduced (usually Counting Fingers or Hand Movements).
2.  **Pupil:** [[Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect]] (RAPD) or Marcus Gunn pupil is present. The direct light reflex is absent or sluggish.
3.  **Fundus Examination:**
    *   **Arteries:** Thread-like and attenuated.
    *   **Retinal Opacity:** The retina appears milky white or cloudy due to ischemic intracellular edema of the nerve fiber and ganglion cell layers.
    *   **[[Cherry-red spot]]:** Seen at the fovea/macula. The fovea is thin and devoid of ganglion cells, allowing the underlying vascular [[choroid]] to shine through, contrasting with the surrounding white edematous retina.
    *   **Cattle-trucking:** Segmentation of the blood column in the veins and arterioles (beading) due to sluggish blood flow.
    *   **Optic Disc:** Pale in later stages (Consecutive [[optic atrophy]]).

**[[Cilioretinal Artery]] Sparing:**
In approximately 14-25% of the population, a cilioretinal artery (derived from the posterior ciliary circulation) supplies the macula. If present, a small island of central vision is preserved despite the CRAO.

### **Differential Diagnosis: Cherry Red Spot**
A cherry-red spot at the macula is a hallmark of CRAO but can be seen in lipid storage disorders and trauma.

**Mnemonic:** **Cherry Trees Never Grow Tall in Sand, Mud & Grime**.
*   **C** - [[CRAO]]
*   **T** - **T**rauma (Blunt trauma causing [[Berlin's edema]]/Commotio retinae)
*   **N** - **N**iemann-Pick disease
*   **G** - **G**M1 Gangliosidosis
*   **T** - **T**ay-Sachs disease
*   **S** - **S**andhoff’s disease
*   **M** - **M**etachromatic leukodystrophy
*   **G** - **G**aucher’s disease (Type 1, Rare) / **M**ultiple sulfatase deficiency

### **Management**
CRAO is an ocular emergency. The retina cannot survive ischemia for more than **90–100 minutes**; therefore, treatment must be instituted immediately (ideally within 4 hours).

**Immediate Treatment Measures (To restore circulation):**
1.  **Ocular Massage:** Firm intermittent massage to lower IOP and potentially dislodge the embolus to a peripheral vessel.
2.  **Lowering Intraocular Pressure:**
    *   **Anterior Chamber [[Paracentesis]]:** Removing aqueous humor to cause sudden hypotony and dilation of vessels.
    *   **Drug Therapy:** IV **[[Acetazolamide]]** (500 mg) or IV **[[Mannitol]]**.
3.  **Vasodilation:**
    *   **[[Carbogen]] Inhalation:** A mixture of 5% CO2 and 95% O2. CO2 causes respiratory acidosis leading to vasodilation; O2 increases oxygenation.
    *   Sublingual Isosorbide dinitrate.
4.  **Patient Position:** Lie flat (supine) to improve ocular perfusion.

**Systemic Workup:**
Once the acute phase is managed, investigation for the underlying cause is mandatory to prevent stroke or fellow eye involvement:
*   Carotid Doppler/Angiography (for atheroma).
*   Echocardiography (for cardiac emboli).
*   ESR and CRP (to rule out [[Giant Cell Arteritis]]).

### **Complications**
*   **[[Optic Atrophy]]:** Consecutive optic atrophy occurs in long-standing cases.
*   **[[Neovascular Glaucoma]]:** Rare (2-6% incidence) compared to CRVO, but can occur.
