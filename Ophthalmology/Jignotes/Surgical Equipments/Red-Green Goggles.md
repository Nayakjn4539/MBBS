# [[Red-Green Goggles]]

### Overview and Principle
[[Red-Green Goggles]] (also known as Red-Green glasses or Anaglyph glasses) are essential clinical tools used in [[Ophthalmology]] and [[Orthoptics]] to investigate **binocular vision**, **ocular motility**, and **sensory anomalies**.

*   **Principle of Dissociation:** The fundamental principle is **dissociation** of the eyes. By placing a red filter in front of one eye and a green filter in front of the other, the two eyes are forced to view different images (dissimilar images),.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   The **Red filter** allows only red light to pass through and blocks green light.
    *   The **Green filter** allows only green light to pass through and blocks red light.
    *   This prevents [[Fusion]] (if the targets are distinct colors) or allows the examiner to determine which eye is seeing which image, thereby revealing latent deviations ([[Heterophoria]]), manifest deviations ([[Heterotropia]]), or suppression.

### Common Clinical Applications

#### 1. Diplopia Charting
This is a subjective test to evaluate [[Diplopia]] (double vision) and identify the paralyzed muscle in cases of [[Incomitant Squint]].

*   **Setup:** The patient wears the goggles (Conventionally: **Red filter on the Right eye**, **Green filter on the Left eye**),.
*   **Procedure:**
    *   The patient is placed in a semi-dark room.
    *   A linear light source (slit lamp beam or torch) is shown from a distance (usually 1 meter).
    *   The patient describes the position and separation of the two images (Red and Green) in the **nine cardinal positions of gaze**.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   **Uncrossed Diplopia (Homonymous):** The Red image is on the Right side and the Green image is on the Left. This indicates **Esotropia** (Convergent squint).
    *   **Crossed Diplopia (Heteronymous):** The Red image is on the Left side and the Green image is on the Right. This indicates **Exotropia** (Divergent squint),.
    *   **Vertical/Torsional Diplopia:** Separation of images vertically or tilted images suggests [[Vertical Muscle]] or [[Oblique Muscle]] involvement.

#### 2. Worth's Four-Dot Test (W4DT)
This is the most common clinical test for **Sensory Anomalies** to detect [[Fusion]], [[Suppression]], or [[Anomalous Retinal Correspondence]] (ARC),.

*   **Apparatus:** A box with 4 illuminated dots:
    *   **1 Red** (Usually Top)
    *   **2 Green** (Usually lateral)
    *   **1 White** (Usually Bottom).
*   **Goggle Arrangement:** **Red on Right eye**, **Green on Left eye**,.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   The **Right eye** (Red filter) sees only the **Red dot**.
    *   The **Left eye** (Green filter) sees only the **Green dots**.
    *   The **White dot** is seen by both eyes (as red by the right and green by the left); fused as a mixture or alternating in dominance.

| Patient Sees | Interpretation | Clinical Condition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **4 Lights** (1 Red, 2 Green, 1 fused) | Normal Fusion | Normal [[Binocular Single Vision]] (BSV) |
| **4 Lights** (in presence of squint) | Abnormal Fusion | [[Anomalous Retinal Correspondence]] (ARC), |
| **2 Red Lights** | Left Eye Suppression | The Left eye image is inhibited by the brain |
| **3 Green Lights** | Right Eye Suppression | The Right eye image is inhibited by the brain |
| **5 Lights** (2 Red, 3 Green) | Diplopia | Paralytic Squint / Decompensated Phoria |
| **Alternating 2 & 3 Lights** | Alternating Suppression | Alternating Squint |

#### 3. Hess Screen and Lees Screen
These tests provide a pictorial record of the ocular motility defects, useful for diagnosing and following up on [[Paralytic Strabismus]].

*   **Principle:** Dissociation using complementary colors (Red and Green).
*   **Procedure (Hess Screen):**
    *   Patient wears red-green goggles (Red filter usually in front of the **Right eye** first/Fixing eye).
    *   A red light is projected onto a screen.
    *   The patient holds a green light projector (or pointer) and attempts to superimpose the green light onto the red target.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   The two eyes are dissociated; one eye fixes (looks at the target) while the other eye attempts to locate it.
    *   The **Smaller Chart** belongs to the eye with the **Paretic/Paralyzed muscle**.
    *   The **Larger Chart** belongs to the eye with the **Overacting muscle** (Secondary deviation).
*   **Lancaster Red-Green Test:** Similar to the Hess test but uses projected streaks of light instead of spots,.

#### 4. Stereopsis Testing (TNO Test)
Used to check [[Stereoacuity]] (Depth perception).

*   **Instrument:** The **TNO Test** booklet.
*   **Method:** Uses random dot stereograms printed in complementary colors (anaglyphs). The patient wears red-green glasses to perceive the hidden 3D shapes,,.
*   **Advantage:** Does not offer monocular clues; highly specific for stereopsis.

#### 5. Testing for Malingering
Used to detect functional visual loss or feigned blindness in one eye.

*   **Snellen's Colored Types Test:** The chart has letters printed in Red and Green.
*   **Procedure:**
    *   A **Red glass** is placed before the "Good/Normal" eye.
    *   The patient is asked to read the chart.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   The eye behind the Red glass can *only* see Red letters (Green letters appear black/invisible because the red filter blocks green light).
    *   If the patient reads the **Green letters**, they are reading with the "Blind" (uncovered or filtered) eye, confirming **Malingering**,.

### Summary of Filter Placement

| Test | Right Eye Filter | Left Eye Filter | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Worth 4-Dot** | **Red** | **Green** | Sensory anomalies (Suppression/Fusion) |
| **Diplopia Charting** | **Red** | **Green** | Locate paralyzed muscle |
| **Hess Screen** | **Red** (usually fixing eye) | **Green** | Charting muscle palsy sequelae |
| **TNO Test** | **Red** | **Green** | Stereopsis (Depth perception) |

### Mnemonics

*   **Worth 4-Dot Filter:** **R**ed on **R**ight (**R** for **R**).
*   **Diplopia Interpretation:** **C**rossed diplopia = Exotropia (**X** looks like a cross). **Un**crossed diplopia = **In**otropia (Esotropia).
