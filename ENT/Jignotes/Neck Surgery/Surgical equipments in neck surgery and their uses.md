# Surgical Equipments in Neck Surgery and Their Uses

## 1. General Surgical Instruments for Neck Exploration

These instruments are fundamental for incision, dissection, hemostasis, and exposure during procedures like [[thyroidectomy]], [[neck dissection]], and excision of [[branchial cyst]] or [[thyroglossal cyst]].

### A. Cutting and Dissecting Instruments
*   **Bard-Parker Handle and Blades:**
    *   **Structure:** Standard scalpel handles (No. 3, 4) fitted with disposable blades.
    *   **Uses:** Making skin incisions (Blade no. 10 or 15) and sharp dissection.
*   **Scissors:**
    *   **[[Metzenbaum scissors]]:** Fine, curved scissors with blunt tips. Used for meticulous dissection of soft tissues, separating fascial planes, and dissecting around vessels and nerves.
    *   **[[Mayo scissors]]:** Stouter and stronger. Used for cutting tough fascia, sutures, or ligatures.
    *   **[[Lister's bandage cutting scissors]]:** Angled scissors with a blunt, flattened lower blade tip. Used to cut bandages without injuring the skin.

### B. Grasping and Holding Instruments
*   **Dissecting Forceps (Thumb Forceps):**
    *   **Plain (Non-toothed):** Used for holding delicate structures like vessels and nerves to avoid trauma.
    *   **Toothed:** Used for holding skin and tough fascia (e.g., [[Lane's tissue forceps]] has 1-in-2 teeth).
    *   **[[Adson's forceps]]:** Small, fine forceps used for delicate soft tissue handling.
*   **Tissue Forceps (Ring-handled):**
    *   **[[Allis tissue forceps]]:** Has inward-curved blades with teeth. Used to hold subcutaneous tissue, fascial flaps, or margins of the retraction pocket. It provides a firm grip but can be traumatic.
    *   **[[Babcock's tissue forceps]]:** Non-traumatic fenestrated blades with transverse serrations. Used to hold delicate structures like the [[internal jugular vein]], cyst walls, or glandular tissue.

### C. Hemostatic Forceps
*   **[[Halsted's mosquito forceps]]:** Small, fine hemostats (straight or curved). Used to clamp small bleeding vessels.
*   **[[Kocher's artery forceps]]:** Strong forceps with a tooth at the tip. Used as a pedicle clamp for holding tough tissues securely (traumatic).
*   **[[Mixter right-angled forceps]] (Lahey’s):**
    *   **Structure:** Forceps with blades angled at 90 degrees.
    *   **Uses:** Dissecting around major vessels (like the internal jugular vein or carotid artery), feeding ligatures around vessels, and clamping pedicles in difficult-to-reach areas.

### D. Retractors
Retractors are essential for exposure in the complex anatomy of the neck.
*   **[[Langenbeck's retractor]]:**
    *   **Structure:** L-shaped flat blade with a handle.
    *   **Uses:** Retracting strap muscles during thyroidectomy and general deep tissue retraction.
*   **[[Joseph's skin hooks]]:**
    *   **Structure:** Fine, single or double sharp hooks.
    *   **Uses:** Retracting skin margins while elevating subplatysmal flaps (e.g., in thyroidectomy or parotidectomy) to prevent crushing skin edges.
*   **[[Self-retaining retractors]] (e.g., Jenson, Mollison):** Though primarily mastoid instruments, they utilize a ratchet mechanism to hold soft tissues apart, freeing the surgeon's hands.
*   **[[Czerney's retractor]]:** Double-ended retractor (one flat, one fenestrated/hooked) used for superficial retraction.

## 2. Tracheostomy Instruments

These are specialized instruments designed to secure the airway safely and rapidly.

### A. Tracheostomy Tubes
| Type | Features | Uses |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Portex tracheostomy tube]]** | Plastic (PVC/Silicon), thermoplastic (softens at body temp). Available as Cuffed or Uncuffed. | Most common tube for ventilation and airway protection. Cuffed tubes prevent aspiration and allow positive pressure ventilation. |
| **[[Fuller's tracheostomy tube]]** | Metallic, bivalved outer tube with an inner tube. | Long-term use. The bivalved nature aids easy insertion; the inner tube allows cleaning without removing the whole assembly. |
| **[[Chevalier Jackson tube]]** | Metallic, silver/steel. Has an inner tube, outer tube, and obturator. | Permanent tracheostomy or long-term airway maintenance. |

### B. Surgical Instruments
*   **[[Tracheal dilator]] (Trousseau’s):**
    *   **Structure:** Two or three blades that spread outwards when the handle is compressed. Tip is blunt.
    *   **Uses:** Inserted into the tracheal incision to dilate the opening and facilitate the insertion of the tracheostomy tube.
    *   **Clinical Implication:** A curved artery forceps can serve as a temporary substitute if this is unavailable.
*   **[[Tracheal hooks]]:**
    *   **Blunt Hook (Isthmus Hook):** Used to retract the [[thyroid isthmus]] upwards or downwards to expose the tracheal rings.
    *   **Sharp Hook (Cricoid Hook):** Applied to the lower border of the [[cricoid cartilage]]. It stabilizes the trachea and elevates it (pulls it superficially), preventing movement during the incision.
    *   **[[Mnemonic]]:** **S**harp for **S**tabilization (Cricoid), **B**lunt for **B**ody (Thyroid).

## 3. Advanced and Powered Instruments

### A. [[Harmonic Scalpel]]
*   **Mechanism:** Uses ultrasonic energy (55,000 cycles/sec) to vibrate the blade.
*   **Function:** Simultaneously cuts and coagulates tissue at lower temperatures (50–100°C) compared to electrocautery.
*   **Uses:** Thyroidectomy, neck dissections, and parotid surgery to reduce thermal damage to nerves and decrease operative time.

### B. [[Coblation]] Wand
*   **Mechanism:** Radiofrequency energy in a saline medium creates a plasma field to dissociate molecular bonds.
*   **Function:** Low-temperature ablation (40–70°C) with hemostasis.
*   **Uses:** Tongue base reduction, tumor excision in the oral cavity/oropharynx, and debulking neck masses.

## 4. Specific Instruments for Miscellaneous Neck Procedures

*   **[[Yankauer suction tube]]:**
    *   **Use:** Suctioning blood and secretions during neck dissection or removal of secretions from the pharynx.
*   **[[Gigli's wire saw]]:**
    *   **Use:** Cutting bone, such as in mandibulectomy or maxillectomy during composite resections for head and neck cancer.
*   **[[Cheatle's forceps]]:**
    *   **Use:** Large forceps used to transfer sterilized instruments and gauze without contaminating them.
*   **[[Negus knot tier]]:**
    *   **Use:** Helps slip ligature knots deep into the wound, essential for ligating vessels in deep neck spaces (e.g., during ligation of the external carotid artery or deep tonsillar vessels).

## Clinical Implications & Safety

*   **Airway Security:** In cases of upper airway obstruction (e.g., Ludwig's angina, extensive tumors), a **[[tracheostomy]] set** must always be ready before inducing anesthesia.
*   **Nerve Preservation:** When using powered instruments like the [[Harmonic scalpel]] or monopolar cautery near the **[[Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve]]** (in thyroidectomy) or **[[Facial Nerve]]** (in parotidectomy), maintain a safe distance to prevent thermal injury.
*   **Vascular Safety:** The **[[internal jugular vein]]** is thin-walled. Use atraumatic vascular clamps or Babcock forceps to handle it during neck dissection to prevent tearing and air embolism.
