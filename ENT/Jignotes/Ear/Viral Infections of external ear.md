# [[Ear]] > Viral Infections of external ear

### Viral Infections of the External Ear

Viral infections of the external ear can manifest as distinct clinical entities affecting the [[pinna]], [[external auditory canal]] (EAC), and the [[tympanic membrane]].

---

### 1. Herpes Zoster Oticus (Ramsay Hunt Syndrome)

This is a specific viral infection caused by the reactivation of the **Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV)**. It is the most significant viral condition affecting the ear due to its neurological complications.

#### Etiopathogenesis
*   **Cause:** Reactivation of the latent [[Varicella Zoster Virus]] residing in the [[geniculate ganglion]] of the [[facial nerve]].
*   **Triggers:** Immunosuppression, physical/psychological stress, aging.
*   **Pathology:** The virus replicates in the ganglion and travels down the nerve fibers to affect the skin of the concha, EAC, and soft palate. It may also spread to the [[vestibulocochlear nerve]] (CN VIII).

#### Clinical Features
*   **Prodrome:** Severe, deep-seated **otalgia** (ear pain) usually precedes the rash by 1–2 days.
*   **Cutaneous Signs:** Vesicular eruption (herpetic vesicles) on an erythematous base.
    *   **Sites:** [[Concha]], [[external auditory canal]], posteromedial surface of the [[pinna]], and sometimes the soft palate.
*   **Neurological Signs:**
    *   **Facial Palsy:** Lower motor neuron (LMN) type facial paralysis. It is often more severe than [[Bell's palsy]].
    *   **Vestibulocochlear symptoms:** [[Sensorineural hearing loss]] (SNHL), tinnitus, and vertigo occur in approx. 25% of patients.
    *   **Other Nerves:** May involve Cranial Nerves V, IX, and X.

#### Diagnosis
*   **Clinical:** Based on the triad of otalgia, vesicles, and facial palsy.
*   **Imaging:** **Gadolinium-enhanced MRI** of the temporal bone shows enhancement of the [[geniculate ganglion]].
*   **Labs:** Tzanck smear showing multinucleated giant cells; VZV DNA detection by PCR.

#### Treatment
*   **Antivirals:** Must be started within 72 hours for efficacy.
    *   Acyclovir (800 mg 5 times/day) OR Valacyclovir (1 gm TDS) for 7 days.
*   **Corticosteroids:** Prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) tapered over a course.
*   **Supportive:** Analgesics for pain, eye care (lubrication, taping at night) to prevent exposure keratitis due to facial palsy.

#### Prognosis
*   Prognosis for facial nerve recovery is **poorer** than Bell's palsy (less than 50% recover completely).

### 2. Bullous Myringitis (Otitis Externa Haemorrhagica)

An inflammatory condition primarily involving the tympanic membrane and deep meatus.

#### Etiology
*   Traditionally associated with *Mycoplasma pneumoniae*, but currently believed to be **primarily viral**.
*   **Causative Agents:** [[Influenza virus]], *Mycoplasma pneumoniae*.
*   **Predisposing factors:** Upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), winter season.

#### Clinical Features
*   **Pain:** Sudden onset of **excruciating otalgia** (severe ear pain).
*   **Discharge:** Sanguineous (blood-stained) or serosanguineous discharge may occur if the bullae rupture.
*   **Hearing:** Mild conductive hearing loss or mixed loss (if SNHL element is present).

#### Otoscopic Findings
*   **Hemorrhagic Bullae:** Purple or red fluid-filled blebs seen on the [[tympanic membrane]] and the deep bony canal skin.
*   Bullae may be multiple.

#### Treatment
*   **Analgesics:** Essential for pain relief.
*   **Antibiotics:** Systemic or topical antibiotics are often prescribed to prevent secondary bacterial infection or treat concurrent otitis media.
*   **Surgical:** Rupturing the bullae (myringotomy) may be performed to relieve severe pain, though spontaneous rupture is common.

### 3. Herpes Simplex Otitis

Infection caused by [[Herpes Simplex Virus]] (HSV).

#### Clinical Features
*   **Primary Infection:** Can present with vesicles in the [[external auditory canal]] and pinna.
*   **Recurrence:** Reactivation can occur, though less common in the ear compared to the lips (herpes labialis).
*   **Symptoms:** Pain, burning sensation, and vesicles that may rupture to form crusts.
*   **Association:** HSV reactivation is implicated in the etiology of Bell's Palsy (without the vesicles seen in Ramsay Hunt).

### Comparison: Bell's Palsy vs. Ramsay Hunt Syndrome

| Feature | Bell's Palsy | Ramsay Hunt Syndrome (Herpes Zoster Oticus) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Etiology** | Idiopathic (HSV-1 implicated) | Reactivation of VZV in Geniculate Ganglion |
| **Rash** | Absent | **Vesicular rash** on pinna/EAC |
| **Pain** | Mild postauricular pain | **Severe, deep-seated otalgia** |
| **Cranial Nerve VIII** | Usually spared | Often involved (Hearing loss, Vertigo) |
| **Prognosis** | Good (85-90% recovery) | Poor (<50% complete recovery) |
| **Treatment** | Steroids ± Antivirals | **Antivirals + Steroids** (Mandatory) |

---

### Other Viral Manifestations

*   **Verruca Vulgaris (Warts):** Viral papillomas caused by [[Human Papillomavirus]] (HPV) appearing as tufted growths on the pinna.
*   **Molluscum Contagiosum:** Poxvirus infection causing umbilicated nodules on the auricular skin.

---

### Clinical Implications
*   **Facial Nerve Decompression:** In Ramsay Hunt syndrome, surgical decompression of the facial nerve is generally **not** indicated or effective compared to Bell's palsy due to the diffuse nature of the viral inflammation.
*   **Elderly/Diabetics:** In immunocompromised patients presenting with severe otalgia and granulations, always rule out **Malignant Otitis Externa** (Bacterial - Pseudomonas) before diagnosing viral etiologies, although Zoster can also be severe in these groups.

### Mnemonic for Ramsay Hunt Syndrome
**"RASH"**
*   **R** - Rash (Vesicular on ear/palate)
*   **A** - Aural Pain (Severe)
*   **S** - Sensory loss (Hearing loss, Vertigo)
*   **H** - Hunt (Ramsay Hunt) / Herpes Zoster
