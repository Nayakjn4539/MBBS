# [[Ear Surgery]] > Tympanoplasty

# Tympanoplasty

**Definition**
[[Tympanoplasty]] refers to any surgical procedure involving the eradication of disease in the [[middle ear]] and the reconstruction of the hearing mechanism (tympanic membrane and/or ossicular chain), with or without mastoid surgery,,.
*   **Myringoplasty:** Limited to the repair of the [[tympanic membrane]] (TM) perforation only (Type I Tympanoplasty),.
*   **Ossiculoplasty:** Limited to the reconstruction of the [[ossicular chain]],.

### Physiological Principles
The goal is to restore the sound-conducting mechanism based on two main principles:
1.  **Hydraulic Effect (Area Ratio):** Restoring the ratio between the large area of the [[tympanic membrane]] and the small area of the [[stapes]] footplate (approx. 17:1 to 20:1) to amplify sound pressure,.
2.  **Phase Difference (Acoustic Separation):** Ensuring sound reaches the [[oval window]] first while shielding the [[round window]] to prevent sound wave cancellation. This requires an intact TM and air in the middle ear.

### Prerequisites for Surgery
For a successful outcome, the following criteria (often pertinent to [[Myringoplasty]]) should be met,,,:
*   **Dry Ear:** Inactive disease with no discharge for at least 3 months (some sources say 6 weeks),,.
*   **Good Cochlear Reserve:** Functional sensorineural apparatus,.
*   **Patent [[Eustachian Tube]]:** Essential for middle ear aeration,.
*   **Healthy Middle Ear Mucosa:** No active infection.
*   **No Active Infection:** In nose, paranasal sinuses (PNS), or throat (e.g., tonsillitis).

### Wullstein's Classification of Tympanoplasty
This classification describes the depth of the middle ear space and the ossicular status reconstructed,,,,,.

| Type | Name / Feature | Defect / Status | Graft Position / Reconstruction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type I** | [[Myringoplasty]] | Perforation of TM; Ossicles intact and mobile. | Graft placed against the **Malleus** (or replaces TM). Normal middle ear depth. |
| **Type II** | Myringoincudopexy | Perforation + Minor erosion of Malleus. | Graft placed on the **Incus** or remnant of Malleus. |
| **Type III** | Myringostapediopexy (Columella Type) | Malleus and Incus absent/eroded; Stapes superstructure intact and mobile. | Graft placed directly on the **Stapes Head**. Also called **Columella tympanoplasty** (mimics single bird ossicle). |
| **Type IV** | Cavum Minor (Oval Window Tympanoplasty) | Stapes superstructure absent; Footplate mobile. | Graft placed between oval and round windows attached to promontory. Sound hits footplate directly; round window is shielded (acoustic separation). |
| **Type V** | Fenestration | Stapes footplate fixed. | A fenestra (window) is created in the **Horizontal Semicircular Canal** and covered with a graft. (Rarely done now). |
| **Type VI** | Sonoinversion | -- | Graft protects oval window; sound enters via round window. |

*   **Fen**ce (Fenestration - Type V)

### Austin’s Classification of Ossicular Defects
Used to describe the status of the ossicular chain (assuming the [[incus]] is the most commonly eroded ossicle),,:

*   **Group A (M+S+):** Malleus handle present, Stapes superstructure present. (Good prognosis).
*   **Group B (M+S-):** Malleus handle present, Stapes superstructure absent.
*   **Group C (M-S+):** Malleus handle absent, Stapes superstructure present.
*   **Group D (M-S-):** Both Malleus handle and Stapes superstructure absent. (Poor prognosis).

### Graft Materials
**Temporalis Fascia** is the most commonly used material,,,,.
*   **Why?** Low metabolic rate (BMR), easily accessible via same incision, thickness similar to TM, close histological kinship,,,.
*   **Other options:** Tragal perichondrium, cartilage (tragal/conchal), vein, fat, periosteum,,.

### Surgical Techniques for Grafting (Myringoplasty)
The approach depends on the placement of the graft relative to the fibrous annulus and malleus,,,,.

#### 1. Underlay Technique (Medial Grafting)
*   **Procedure:** Graft is placed **medial** to the tympanic membrane remnants and annulus, and medial to the malleus handle,,.
*   **Advantages:** Easier to perform, avoids burying squamous epithelium (low risk of cholesteatoma/pearls),.
*   **Disadvantages/Complications:** Middle ear space may become narrow, graft may adhere to promontory, medialization of graft,,.

#### 2. Overlay Technique (Lateral Grafting)
*   **Procedure:** Graft is placed **lateral** to the fibrous layer of the TM but medial to the handle of malleus (after removing squamous epithelium),,.
*   **Advantages:** Good for anterior perforations.
*   **Disadvantages/Complications:**
    *   **Blunting:** Loss of anterior sulcus angle,,.
    *   **Lateralization:** Graft pulls away from the malleus handle causing conductive hearing loss,,.
    *   **Epithelial Pearls:** Inclusion cysts if skin is not perfectly removed,,.

### Ossiculoplasty (Reconstruction)
When the ossicular chain is disrupted, reconstruction is performed using,,:
*   **Autografts:** Patient's own ossicles (e.g., incus reshaped) or cartilage,.
*   **Prostheses:**
    *   **PORP (Partial Ossicular Replacement Prosthesis):** Connects Malleus/TM to Stapes Head (Used in Austin A or C),,.
    *   **TORP (Total Ossicular Replacement Prosthesis):** Connects Malleus/TM to Stapes Footplate (Used in Austin B or D),,,.

### Tympanoplasty with Mastoidectomy
Surgery may involve clearing disease from the mastoid (e.g., [[Cholesteatoma]]).
1.  **Canal Wall Up (CWU) / Combined Approach Tympanoplasty (CAT):**
    *   Posterior canal wall is preserved.
    *   Disease removed via **Posterior Tympanotomy** (opening the facial recess between facial nerve and chorda tympani),,,.
    *   *Advantage:* Normal anatomy maintained, easier reconstruction.
    *   *Disadvantage:* Higher recurrence rate (residual cholesteatoma in sinus tympani),.
2.  **Canal Wall Down (CWD) / Modified Radical Mastoidectomy (MRM):**
    *   Posterior canal wall is removed; mastoid and middle ear converted into a single cavity,,.
    *   *Advantage:* Lower recurrence, disease fully exteriorized.
    *   *Disadvantage:* Cavity problems (discharge, dewaxing needed), water precautions required,.

### Complications of Surgery
*   **Immediate:** Facial nerve palsy, chorda tympani injury (taste loss), sensorineural hearing loss (labyrinthine trauma),,.
*   **Delayed:**
    *   Graft failure/Reperforation.
    *   **Lateralization** or **Blunting** (Overlay technique),.
    *   **Medialization** or adhesions to promontory (Underlay technique),.
    *   Cholesteatoma formation (Epithelial pearls).
    *   Stenosis of ear canal.
