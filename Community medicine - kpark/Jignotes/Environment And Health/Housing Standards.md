# [[Environment And Health]] > Housing Standards

### **Housing Standards**

Housing is an integral part of the **[[Residential Environment]]**, which includes the physical structure, immediate surroundings, and related community services. The standards for healthful housing in India, primarily recommended by the **[[Environmental Hygiene Committee]] (1949)**, aim to promote physical, mental, and social well-being.

#### **1. Criteria for Healthful Housing**

To be considered healthful, housing must fulfill specific physiological and sanitary needs:

| Component | Standard / Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Site** | • Elevated from surroundings (prevents flooding).<br>• Independent access to street.<br>• Away from breeding places of flies/mosquitoes.<br>• Subsoil water should be **below 10 feet** (3 meters). |
| **Set Back** | • Open space all around for light/ventilation.<br>• **Rural areas:** Built-up area $\le$ 1/3rd of total area.<br>• **Urban areas:** Built-up area $\le$ 2/3rd of total area. |
| **Floor** | • **Pucca**, impermeable, smooth (free of cracks to prevent insect breeding/dust).<br>• Damp-proof.<br>• **Plinth height:** 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 1 meter). |
| **Walls** | • Reasonably strong with low heat capacity.<br>• Weather-resistant and unsuitable for rat harbourage.<br>• Ideally **9-inch brick wall**, plastered smooth and colored light (cream/white). |
| **Roof** | • Height **> 10 feet (3m)** in absence of air-conditioning.<br>• Low heat transmittance coefficient. |
| **Rooms** | • Minimum **2 living rooms**.<br>• At least one closable for security. |
| **Floor Area** | • **Per person:** Minimum 50 sq. ft; Optimum **100 sq. ft**.<br>• **Living room area:** $\ge$ 120 sq. ft for >1 person; $\ge$ 100 sq. ft for single person. |
| **Cubic Space** | • **500 c.ft per capita** (preferably 1000 c.ft).<br>• Height >10-12 ft is not counted in calculation (as respiration products accumulate at lower levels)., |
| **Windows** | • At least **2 windows** per living room (opening directly to open space).<br>• Placement: Height $\le$ 3 ft from floor.<br>• **Window Area:** 1/5th of floor area.<br>• **Doors + Windows Area:** 2/5th of floor area. |
| **Lighting** | • **[[Daylight factor]]** should exceed **1%** over half the floor area. |
| **Kitchen** | • Separate kitchen is a MUST.<br>• Protected from dust/smoke; impervious floor.<br>• Fitted with a sink and proper drainage. |
| **Sanitation** | • **Privy:** Sanitary latrine in every house.<br>• **Garbage:** Daily removal and sanitary disposal.<br>• **Water:** Safe and adequate continuous supply., |

#### **2. Rural Housing Specifics**
In rural areas, slightly lower "approved" standards may apply:
*   **Rooms:** At least 2 living rooms.
*   **Cattle Shed:** At least **25 feet away** from the dwelling house.
*   **Water Source:** Sanitary well/tube well within a quarter of a mile.
*   **Sanitary Latrine:** Essential.

> Draw a schematic diagram of a model house showing setback, cross-ventilation windows, separate kitchen with smoke outlet, and cattle shed distance

#### **3. Overcrowding**
Overcrowding is a significant health hazard promoting the spread of respiratory infections. It is assessed using three specific criteria. **Overcrowding exists if ANY ONE of the following is violated:**

**A. Persons Per Room**
| Number of Rooms | Maximum Persons Allowed |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 Room | 2 persons |
| 2 Rooms | 3 persons |
| 3 Rooms | 5 persons |
| 4 Rooms | 7 persons |
| 5 Rooms | 10 persons (+2 for each extra room) |
**

**B. Floor Space Per Person**
*(Note: Baby < 12 months = 0 unit; Child 1–10 years = ½ unit)*

| Floor Area (sq. ft) | Permissible Persons |
| :--- | :--- |
| $\ge$ 110 | 2 |
| 90 – 100 | 1 ½ |
| 70 – 90 | 1 |
| 50 – 70 | ½ |
| < 50 | Nil |
**

**C. Sex Separation**
Overcrowding exists if **2 persons over 9 years of age**, not husband and wife, of opposite sexes are obliged to sleep in the same room.

> **Mnemonic for Floor Space:** **"11-9-7-5 Rule"**
> *   **11**0+ = 2 people
> *   **9**0-100 = 1.5 people
> *   **7**0-90 = 1 person
> *   **5**0-70 = 0.5 person

#### **4. Housing and Health (Clinical Relevance)**
Poor housing is part of the **[[Web of Causation]]** for many diseases.

1.  **Respiratory Infections:** Air-borne transmission is facilitated by overcrowding and poor ventilation (e.g., **[[Tuberculosis]]**, Influenza, Diphtheria, Measles).
2.  **Skin Infections:** Contact transmission due to crowding and lack of water (e.g., Scabies, Ringworm, Impetigo, Leprosy).
3.  **Rat Infestation:** Poor structure allows harbor for rats, leading to **[[Plague]]** and Leptospirosis.
4.  **Arthropods:** Houseflies, mosquitoes, fleas, and bugs thrive in poor sanitation.
5.  **Accidents:** Structural defects lead to domestic accidents.
6.  **Psychosocial Effects:** "Sense of isolation" in high-rise buildings or stress/lack of privacy in crowded slums can lead to neurosis and behavioral disorders.
