# [[Metabolic Bone Diseases]] > Rickets

### Rickets (Nutritional and Resistant)

[[Rickets]] is a metabolic bone disorder characterized by the failure of mineralization of the [[osteoid]] matrix in the growing skeleton (children) before the closure of the growth plates []. It is essentially a qualitative defect of the bone, distinguishing it from osteoporosis (quantitative defect) []. The adult equivalent, occurring after skeletal maturity, is known as [[Osteomalacia]] [].

### Pathophysiology
The fundamental defect is a deficiency in calcium or phosphate availability, leading to a failure of calcium salts to deposit in the organic bone matrix.
*   **Normal Physiology:** [[Vitamin D]] is converted in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D and then in the kidney to the active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D []. This active form regulates calcium and phosphorus absorption from the gut and mineralization of bone [].
*   **Mechanism in Rickets:**
    1.  Vitamin D deficiency leads to decreased intestinal absorption of calcium [].
    2.  This causes transient [[Hypocalcemia]], which stimulates the parathyroid glands to secrete [[Parathormone]] (PTH) [].
    3.  **Secondary Hyperparathyroidism:** High PTH mobilizes calcium from the bone and increases renal excretion of phosphate (phosphaturia) [].
    4.  **Result:** Serum calcium may normalize (at the expense of bone), but serum phosphate remains low. The calcium-phosphate product drops below the critical level required for mineralization [].
*   **Growth Plate Changes:** The zone of provisional calcification fails to calcify. Cartilage cells continue to proliferate but do not mature or degenerate, leading to an accumulation of cartilage. This causes the **widening** and **splaying** of the [[Growth Plate]] (physis) seen clinically and radiologically [].

### Classification
Rickets can be broadly classified based on etiology:

**1. Nutritional Rickets (Type I)**
*   Most common variety [].
*   **Causes:**
    *   Dietary deficiency of Vitamin D [].
    *   Lack of exposure to sunlight (synthesis of Vitamin D3 in skin) [].
    *   Malabsorption syndromes (e.g., Celiac disease) [].

**2. Vitamin D Resistant Rickets (Refractory Rickets)**
These types do not respond to physiological doses of Vitamin D [].
*   **Hypophosphatemic Rickets (Type II):** X-linked dominant disorder involving defective renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate [].
*   **Renal Osteodystrophy (Renal Rickets):** Chronic renal failure leads to a deficiency of the enzyme **1-alpha-hydroxylase**, preventing the conversion of Vitamin D into its active form (calcitriol) [,]. Also involves phosphate retention.
*   **Vitamin D Dependent Rickets:**
    *   Type I: Defective 1-alpha-hydroxylase enzyme [].
    *   Type II: End-organ resistance to Vitamin D [].

### Clinical Features
The clinical presentation varies by age but typically follows a "Head to Toe" progression [].

**1. General Symptoms**
*   Irritability and lethargy [].
*   **Hypotonia:** Pot-belly appearance due to weak abdominal muscles [].
*   Delayed milestones (e.g., delayed walking, teething) [].
*   Stunted growth [].
*   Bone pain and reluctance to move the limbs [].

**2. Skeletal Deformities (Head to Toe)**
| Region | Deformity / Sign | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Skull** | [[Craniotabes]] | Softening of the skull bones, giving a "ping-pong ball" sensation on compression. Earliest sign []. |
| | Frontal Bossing | Prominence of frontal and parietal bones, leading to a "square skull" (**Caput Quadratum**) []. |
| | Fontanelles | Delayed closure of anterior fontanelle []. |
| **Teeth** | Delayed Dentition | Delayed eruption and defects in enamel []. |
| **Chest** | **Rachitic Rosary** | Beading at the costochondral junctions. Prominent, blunt, and non-tender []. |
| | [[Pigeon Chest]] | (**Pectus Carinatum**) Prominence of the sternum []. |
| | [[Harrison's Groove]] | A transverse sulcus/groove at the lower chest caused by the pull of the diaphragm on soft ribs []. |
| **Extremities** | Widening of Joints | Widening of wrists and ankles due to physeal splaying []. |
| | Double Malleoli | Appearance of double malleoli at the ankle []. |
| **Lower Limbs**| **Genu Varum** | [[Bow legs]]; common in early walkers []. |
| | **Genu Valgum** | [[Knock knees]]; common in older children []. |
| | Coxa Vara | Deformity of the femoral neck []. |
| **Spine** | [[Kyphosis]]/[[Scoliosis]] | "Rachitic cat-back" due to ligament laxity and bone softening [,]. |

### Radiological Features
Radiological changes are most pronounced at the fastest-growing ends of long bones (knees and wrists) [].

1.  **Widening of the Physis:** The radiolucent growth plate becomes abnormally wide [].
2.  **Cupping of the Metaphysis:** The metaphysis becomes concave (cupped) due to pressure from the accumulated cartilage [].
3.  **Splaying of the Metaphysis:** The metaphyseal end widens (splays) laterally [].
4.  **Fraying:** The metaphyseal margin becomes irregular and indistinct ("paint-brush appearance") [].
5.  **Generalized Findings:**
    *   Generalized [[Osteopenia]] (rarefaction) [].
    *   Thinning of cortices [].
    *   **Looser's Zones:** (Pseudofractures) Radiolucent bands perpendicular to the cortex, usually on the compression side of bones (e.g., scapula, ribs, pubic rami, femoral neck) [].

### Laboratory Investigations (Biochemistry)

| Type of Rickets | Serum Calcium | Serum Phosphate | Alkaline Phosphatase | Parathormone (PTH) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nutritional** | Normal or Low | **Low** | **High** | **High** |
| **Renal Rickets** | **Low** | **High** (Retention) | High | High |
| **Hypophosphatemic** | Normal | Very Low | High | Normal/Mild High |

*Note: Elevated [[Alkaline Phosphatase]] is a consistent finding indicating high bone turnover [].*

### Differential Diagnosis
The primary differential is **Scurvy** (Vitamin C deficiency).

| Feature | **Rickets** | **Scurvy** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Deficiency** | Vitamin D | Vitamin C |
| **Tenderness** | Absent / Mild (Bone pain) | **Present** (Exquisite tenderness due to subperiosteal bleed) [] |
| **Radiology** | Cupping, Splaying, Fraying | Pencil-thin cortex, Ground glass appearance, **White line of Frankel**, **Wimberger's ring sign**, **Pelkan's spur** [] |
| **Rosary** | Blunt, non-tender | Sharp, angular, tender (Scorbutic rosary) [] |

### Treatment

#### 1. Medical Management
**Nutritional Rickets:**
*   **Vitamin D Supplementation:**
    *   **Stoss Therapy:** Large single oral dose of **600,000 IU** of Vitamin D. This allows the body to store the vitamin in adipose tissue and utilize it over months []. Healing lines should appear on X-ray within 3-4 weeks [].
    *   **Daily Therapy:** 2,000–5,000 IU daily for 4-6 weeks, followed by a maintenance dose of 400 IU/day [].
*   **Calcium Supplementation:** Essential to prevent hypocalcemic tetany during the "hungry bone" phase of healing.
*   **Diet:** Exposure to sunlight and diet rich in dairy, eggs, and fish.

**Resistant Rickets:**
*   **Renal Rickets:** Requires active Vitamin D (**Calcitriol** or 1-alpha-hydroxy vitamin D) because the kidney cannot hydroxylate cholecalciferol []. Phosphate binders may be needed to lower serum phosphate.
*   **Hypophosphatemic Rickets:** Requires high doses of oral **Phosphate** and active Vitamin D [].

#### 2. Orthopedic Management
*   **Conservative:** Mild deformities often correct spontaneously with medical treatment and growth remodeling [].
*   **Surgical:** Corrective [[Osteotomy]] is indicated for severe, persistent deformities after the metabolic disease is controlled and serum parameters (ALP) have normalized [].
    *   Example: **MacEwen's Osteotomy** for Genu Valgum (Knock knees) [].
