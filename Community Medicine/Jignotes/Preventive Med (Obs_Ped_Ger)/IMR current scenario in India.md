### Infant Mortality Rate (IMR): Current Scenario in India

**Definition**
[[Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)]] is defined as the number of deaths of children less than **one year** of age per **1000 live births** in a given year.
*   **Formula:**
    $$IMR = \frac{\text{Number of deaths of children < 1 year in a year}}{\text{Number of live births in the same year}} \times 1000$$

**Significance:**
*   It is considered a sensitive indicator of the **health status** of a community.
*   It reflects the **socio-economic development** and the effectiveness of [[Maternal and Child Health (MCH)]] services.
*   It is one of the best predictors of state failure.

### Current Statistics (Data as per Sources)

**1. National Estimates:**
*   **SRS 2020 / SRS 2022:** The IMR in India has declined to **28 per 1000 live births**.
*   **NFHS-5 (2019-21):** The estimated IMR is **35.2 per 1000 live births**.

**2. Rural vs. Urban Divide (SRS 2020):**
*   **Rural IMR:** 31 per 1000 live births.
*   **Urban IMR:** 19 per 1000 live births.
*   *Interpretation:* There is a significant gap, with rural areas experiencing higher mortality due to lack of access to healthcare and sanitation.

**3. Gender Differentials:**
*   Historically, female infant mortality has been higher than male mortality in the post-neonatal period in India due to social neglect.

### State-wise Variations (Yardstick of Health)

There is a massive disparity between different states in India, reflecting uneven development.

| **Category** | **State** | **IMR (per 1000 Live Births)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lowest (Best)** | **Kerala** | **6** |
| **Highest (Worst)** | **Madhya Pradesh** | **43** |
| **High Burden States** | Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Odisha | Above National Average |

**Clinical Relevance:** This disparity highlights the need for decentralized planning (e.g., focus on Empowered Action Group or EAG states) under the [[National Health Mission]].

### Causes of Infant Mortality in India

The causes are generally multifactorial, usually grouped into Neonatal (0-28 days) and Post-neonatal (28 days - 1 year).

**1. Major Medical Causes:**
*   **Low Birth Weight (LBW) & Prematurity:** This is the single **most common cause** of infant deaths in India (approx. 57%).
*   **Respiratory Infections (ARI):** Second most common cause (approx. 17%).
*   **Diarrheal Diseases:** Approx. 4%.
*   **Congenital Malformations:** Approx. 5%.
*   **Sepsis/Cord Infection.**

**2. Social and Cultural Factors:**
*   Age of mother (<19 years or >30 years).
*   Birth spacing (<2 years interval increases risk).
*   High parity (Birth order 5 or more).
*   Female illiteracy.
*   Poor environmental sanitation.

**Mnemonic for Risk Factors:** **"WEANING"**
*   **W**eight (Low Birth Weight < 2.5 kg)
*   **E**nvironment (Poor sanitation)
*   **A**ge of mother (<19 or >35)
*   **N**utrition (Malnutrition)
*   **I**nfections (Respiratory/Diarrhea)
*   **N**eglect (Female child)
*   **G**ap (Birth spacing < 2 years)

### Goals and Targets

*   **National Health Policy (NHP) 2017:** Targeted to reduce IMR to **28** by the year 2019 (Target Achieved as per SRS 2020).
*   **Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 3.2):** End preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age.

### Key Interventions for Reduction

1.  **Promotion of Institutional Deliveries:** Through schemes like [[Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY)]] and [[Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK)]] to ensure skilled attendance at birth.
2.  **Newborn Care:** Establishment of **Special Newborn Care Units (SNCUs)** and Newborn Care Corners (NBCCs).
3.  **Home Based Newborn Care (HBNC):** Performed by [[ASHA]] workers to identify danger signs early.
4.  **Immunization:** Strengthening coverage through **Mission Indradhanush** to prevent vaccine-preventable diseases.
5.  **Nutrition:** Promotion of **Exclusive Breastfeeding** for the first 6 months and appropriate complementary feeding.
6.  **Nutritional Rehabilitation Centers (NRCs):** For management of Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM).
