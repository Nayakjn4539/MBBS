# [[Infections Of Bone]] > Chronic Osteomyelitis

# Chronic Osteomyelitis

[[Chronic Osteomyelitis]] is a severe, persistent, and incapacitating infection of bone and bone marrow. It is often a sequel to acute haematogenous osteomyelitis, but nowadays frequently follows an open fracture or operation. It is characterized by the presence of dead bone ([[Sequestrum]]), new bone formation ([[Involucrum]]), and drainage channels ([[Cloaca]] and [[Sinus]]).

### Etiopathogenesis
Chronic osteomyelitis develops when acute infection is not eradicated. This persistence can be due to:
1.  **Delayed/Inadequate Treatment:** Failure to drain pus or inadequate antibiotic therapy allows the infection to spread.
2.  **Type/Virulence of Organism:** [[Staphylococcus aureus]] is the most common organism (90%). Others include *E. coli*, *Proteus*, *Pseudomonas* (common in IV drug abusers), and *Salmonella* (in sickle cell anemia).
3.  **Reduced Host Resistance:** Malnutrition and immune deficiency compromise defense mechanisms.
4.  **Local Factors:** Presence of foreign bodies (implants) or necrotic bone.

**Mechanism of Transition from Acute to Chronic:**
*   In acute infection, rising intraosseous pressure, vascular stasis, and infective thrombosis compromise blood supply.
*   This leads to bone necrosis ([[Sequestrum]]).
*   Simultaneously, pus strips the periosteum from the cortex.
*   The deep layer of the periosteum (cambium layer) retains osteogenic potential and lays down new bone around the dead bone. This new bone is the [[Involucrum]].

### Pathological Anatomy: The Cardinal Features

The pathology is characterized by the simultaneous destruction of bone and formation of new bone.

#### 1. Sequestrum (The Dead Bone)
*   **Definition:** A piece of dead bone surrounded by infected granulation tissue. It is separated from the living bone by a zone of granulation tissue.
*   **Pathology:** Formed due to the cut-off of blood supply (both endosteal and periosteal) by the infective process.
*   **Appearance:** It is dense (sclerotic), has jagged/irregular margins, and is avascular (does not bleed on scraping). It acts as a foreign body, harbouring bacteria and preventing healing.

**Table: Types of Sequestrum**

| Type of Sequestrum | Associated Condition/Feature |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tubular/Diaphyseal** | Acute pyogenic osteomyelitis (entire diaphysis affected) |
| **Ring Sequestrum** | Infected pin tract (e.g., from external fixators) |
| **Ivory Sequestrum** | Syphilitic osteomyelitis |
| **Black Sequestrum** | Fungal osteomyelitis (Maduromycosis) |
| **Sandy/Rice Grain** | Viral osteomyelitis or Tuberculosis |
| **Feathery** | Tuberculosis of ribs |
| **Coke Sequestrum** | Cancellous bone tuberculosis |

#### 2. Involucrum (The New Bone)
*   **Definition:** A sheath of reactive, immature, subperiosteal new bone that forms around the sequestrum.
*   **Formation:** Generated by the deep layer of the elevated periosteum.
*   **Function:** It attempts to wall off the infection and maintain the structural integrity of the bone shaft.
*   **Characteristics:** It is vascular, irregular, and often thickens the bone, giving it a woody or sclerotic feel on palpation.

#### 3. Cloaca (The Bone Opening)
*   **Definition:** An opening or perforation in the [[Involucrum]] through which pus and bony spicules (sequestra) discharge from the medullary cavity.
*   **Pathology:** It allows the drainage of pus from the bone abscess into the surrounding soft tissues.
*   **Clinical Significance:** A cloaca usually communicates with a [[Sinus tract]] that opens onto the skin surface.

#### 4. Sinus (The Soft Tissue Track)
*   **Definition:** A tract leading from the bone (Cloaca) to the skin surface.
*   **Characteristics:** Usually multiple and fixed to the underlying bone. The opening may show sprouting granulation tissue (pouting sinus).

### Clinical Features

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Discharging Sinus:** The most common complaint. May release pus or small bony fragments.
    *   **Pain:** Often minimal, but becomes severe (throbbing) during acute exacerbations (flare-ups) when pus builds up under pressure.
    *   **Swelling:** Thickening of the limb.
    *   **Constitutional Symptoms:** Fever and malaise are usually absent unless there is an acute flare-up.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Scars:** Puckered, adherent scars from previous sinuses.
    *   **Bone Thickening:** Irregular thickening and tenderness of the bone (due to Involucrum).
    *   **Sinus:** Fixed to the bone; may have excoriated surrounding skin.
    *   **Deformity:** Limb length discrepancy or angular deformity due to growth plate damage.

### Investigations

#### 1. Imaging
*   **X-ray:**
    *   **Bone changes:** Irregular thickening, sclerosis, and cortical irregularity.
    *   **Sequestrum:** Appears denser (whiter) than surrounding bone because it is avascular and does not undergo disuse osteoporosis like the surrounding living bone. It has irregular/sharp edges.
    *   **Involucrum:** Seen as new bone formation surrounding the sequestered segment.
    *   **Cloaca:** May be visualized as a defect in the involucrum.
*   **Sinogram:** Injection of radiopaque dye into the sinus to trace its track, locate the cavity, and identify the sequestrum.
*   **CT Scan:** Superior for identifying sequestra, cloacae, and the extent of the cavity.
*   **MRI:** Best for evaluating soft tissue extension, marrow edema, and active infection.

#### 2. Laboratory
*   **Blood:** ESR and CRP may be elevated during active phases. WBC count is usually normal unless there is an acute flare.
*   **Culture:** Pus culture (from the deep site, not just the skin) is essential to identify the organism and sensitivity.

### Treatment

The goal is the eradication of infection and the preservation of function. Antibiotics alone are insufficient because they cannot penetrate the avascular sequestrum and the sclerotic involucrum.

#### 1. Medical Management
*   **Antibiotics:** Used to control acute flares and as an adjunct to surgery.
*   Duration: usually 4–6 weeks parenteral followed by oral.
*   Choice depends on culture sensitivity (e.g., Vancomycin for MRSA).

#### 2. Surgical Management
Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for chronic osteomyelitis.
*   **Sequestrectomy:** Removal of the dead bone (sequestrum). Performed only when the involucrum is strong enough to support the limb to prevent pathological fracture.
*   **Saucerization:** Unroofing the bone cavity to convert a deep, narrow cavity into a shallow depression (saucer-shape) to allow free drainage.
*   **Curettage:** Removal of infected granulation tissue and scraping the cavity walls until **Paprika Sign** is seen (punctate bleeding indicating viable bone).
*   **Excision of Sinus Tract:** The epithelialized tract must be excised.
*   **Dead Space Management:** The resulting cavity must be managed to prevent recurrence:
    *   **Closed Irrigation/Suction:** Instillation of antibiotics and suction drainage.
    *   **Bone Grafting:** Packing with cancellous chips (Papineau technique).
    *   **Antibiotic Beads:** Implantation of PMMA beads impregnated with heat-stable antibiotics (e.g., Gentamicin, Tobramycin).
    *   **Muscle Flaps:** Filling the cavity with a vascularized muscle flap.
*   **Ilizarov Technique:** For radical resection of infected bone segment and bone transport (distraction osteogenesis) to fill the gap.

### Complications

*   **Acute Exacerbation:** Recurrent flares of infection.
*   **Pathological Fracture:** Due to bone weakening from the cavity or during sequestrectomy.
*   **Growth Disturbance:** Shortening or deformity if the physis is involved.
*   **Joint Stiffness:** Due to soft tissue scarring or septic arthritis.
*   **Amyloidosis:** A rare complication of long-standing suppuration.
*   **Malignancy:** Squamous cell carcinoma ([[Marjolin's Ulcer]]) may develop in a long-standing discharging sinus tract (approx. 1% incidence).
