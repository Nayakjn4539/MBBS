# Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS)

### **Definition and Historical Context**
*   **Definition:** [[Congenital Rubella Syndrome]] refers to a constellation of congenital anomalies in the newborn resulting from maternal infection with the rubella virus (German Measles) during pregnancy, followed by **vertical transmission** across the placenta to the fetus.
*   **Discovery:** The teratogenic potential of the virus was first discovered by **Norman Gregg** (an ophthalmologist) in 1941, who noticed an epidemic of congenital cataracts.

### **Pathogenesis and Transmission**
*   **Mechanism:** The virus inhibits cell division (mitosis) in the developing fetus, leading to hypoplastic organ development and structural anomalies.
*   **Crucial Factor:** The extent of damage depends heavily on the **gestational age** at the time of infection.

| Gestational Age | Risk of Fetal Infection | Consequence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **< 11 Weeks (1st Trimester)** | ~90% | **Most Disastrous.** Multiple congenital defects, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth. |
| **11–16 Weeks** | ~55% | Risk decreases; deafness and retinopathy may occur. |
| **> 16 Weeks** | Low | Major structural defects are rare, though sensorineural hearing loss can occur up to 20 weeks. |

> **Clinical Relevance:** Rubella infection in the mother leads to a chronic infection in the fetus. Infants with CRS shed the virus in pharyngeal secretions and urine for **12–18 months** after birth, posing a significant public health risk to susceptible contacts.

### **Clinical Manifestations**

#### **1. The Classic Triad (Gregg’s Triad)**
The three most common and classic features are:
1.  **Auditory:** [[Sensorineural Deafness]] (Most common permanent sequela).
2.  **Cardiac:** [[Patent Ductus Arteriosus]] (PDA) is the most common, followed by Pulmonary Artery Stenosis.
3.  **Ocular:** Cataracts (typically pearly, nuclear), Microphthalmia, Glaucoma.

#### **2. Expanded CRS Syndrome**
Apart from the triad, CRS affects multiple systems:
*   **CNS:** Microcephaly, Mental retardation, Meningoencephalitis.
*   **Ocular:** **"Salt and pepper"** pigmentary retinopathy.
*   **Dermatological:** [[Blueberry Muffin Rash]] (due to thrombocytopenic purpura and extramedullary hematopoiesis).
*   **Growth:** Intrauterine Growth Retardation (IUGR), Low Birth Weight.
*   **Skeletal:** Radiolucencies in long bones (celery stalking).
*   **Abdominal:** Hepatosplenomegaly, Hepatitis.

#### **3. Late-Onset Manifestations**
Some conditions appear later in childhood or adolescence:
*   Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM).
*   Thyroiditis.
*   Progressive panencephalitis.

### **Laboratory Diagnosis**
Since clinical diagnosis can be difficult, laboratory confirmation is essential.
1.  **IgM Antibody Detection:** Presence of rubella-specific **IgM antibodies** in the newborn is diagnostic. IgM does not cross the placenta; its presence implies the fetus synthesized it in utero.
2.  **IgG Antibody Persistence:** Persistence of **IgG antibodies** beyond 6 months of age (when maternal antibodies should have disappeared) confirms diagnosis.
3.  **Viral Isolation:** Virus can be isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs, urine, CSF, or blood.

### **Prevention and Control**

The goal is to prevent fetal infection by ensuring women of childbearing age are immune.

*   **Vaccination:** The primary strategy is the administration of the [[Live Attenuated Vaccine]] containing the **RA 27/3 strain**.
*   **Schedule:** Usually given as MR (Measles-Rubella) or MMR (Measles-Mumps-Rubella) at **9 months** and **15 months**.
*   **Target Group:**
    *   Infants and children (Routine immunization).
    *   Adolescent girls (15–19 years).
    *   Women of Reproductive Age (Non-pregnant).
*   **Contraindications:** Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication for the live vaccine due to theoretical teratogenic risk.
*   **Precaution:** Women should avoid pregnancy for **1 month** after receiving the rubella vaccine.

### **Mnemonic: "I <3 RUBY EARRINGS"**

To remember the features of CRS:
*   **I** (Eye) - Cataracts, Retinopathy
*   **<3** (Heart) - [[Patent Ductus Arteriosus]], Pulmonary Stenosis
*   **RUBY** (Rubella) - **Blueberry** Muffin Rash
*   **EAR** - Sensorineural Deafness (Most common)
*   **RINGS** - Growth retardation (Small size/Microcephaly)
