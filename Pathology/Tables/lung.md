| **Lung Carcinoma** A malignant epithelial tumor of the lung. | **Cigarette smoke** is the main carcinogen. Other factors include industrial hazards (asbestos, arsenic, chromium, uranium, nickel), high-dose ionizing radiation, and air pollution (radon gas). | **Tobacco Smoking**: Occurs in active smokers or recent quitters. Pipe and cigar smoking also confer risk. **Industrial exposure**. **Genetic predisposition**: Variants in P-450 monooxygenase system, mutagen sensitivity genotype. | Arises from a stepwise accumulation of oncogenic "driver" mutations in pulmonary epithelial cells. There is a correlation between smoking intensity and epithelial changes, starting with **basal cell hyperplasia** and **squamous metaplasia**, progressing to **squamous dysplasia**, then **carcinoma in situ**, and finally **invasive cancer**. Carcinogens in smoke create a "**field effect**," mutagenizing large areas of respiratory mucosa. | Varies by subtype: **Adenocarcinoma**: Gain-of-function mutations in growth factor receptor pathways, including **EGFR, ALK, ROS1, MET, RET**. Also activating mutations in downstream signaling molecules like **KRAS, BRAF, PI3K**. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: Chromosome deletions involving tumor suppressor loci (3p, 9p-**CDKN2A**, 17p-**TP53**). Most have **TP53** mutations. **CDKN2A** is often mutated. Amplification of **FGFR1**. **Small Cell Carcinoma**: Almost universal inactivation of **TP53** and **RB**. Loss of chromosome 3p. Amplification of **MYC** family genes. | May arise in central/hilar region (squamous cell) or periphery (adenocarcinoma). Gray-white, firm to hard tissue.

May cause cavitation. | **Adenocarcinoma**: Glandular differentiation, mucin production. Patterns: acinar, lepidic, papillary, micropapillary, solid. Expresses **TTF-1**. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: Keratinization (squamous pearls) and/or intercellular bridges.  **Small Cell Carcinoma**: Small cells with scant cytoplasm, ill-defined borders, finely granular 'salt and pepper' chromatin, absent nucleoli, frequent nuclear molding. **Azzopardi effect**. Expresses neuroendocrine markers (chromogranin, synaptophysin). **Large Cell Carcinoma**: Undifferentiated, large nuclei, prominent nucleoli. Diagnosis of exclusion. | Insidious onset. Cough, weight loss, chest pain, and dyspnea. Symptoms may arise from metastases (e.g., back pain, headache, seizures). | Cytologic smears of sputum or bronchial lavage/brushings. Biopsy. Imaging (CT scan). **TNM staging system** is used. Immunohistochemistry for markers like **TTF-1**, **napsin A** (adenocarcinoma), **p40**, **p63** (squamous). | **Major Histologic Categories:** 1.

Squamous dysplasia and carcinoma in situ | **Local spread**: Obstruction causing focal emphysema, atelectasis, bronchiectasis, lung abscess.  **Superior vena cava syndrome**.  **Pancoast tumors** invading neural structures causing severe pain and Horner syndrome.  **Pericarditis/Pleuritis** with effusion.  **Metastasis**: Adrenals, liver, brain, bone.  **Paraneoplastic Syndromes**. | **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC):** Surgery if localized. Chemotherapy, radiation. Targeted therapy for specific mutations. Checkpoint inhibitor therapy. **Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC):** Very sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation. |
| **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** Symptoms in cancer patients not caused by the local tumor mass but by ectopic hormone secretion or autoimmune responses triggered by the tumor. | Ectopic production of hormones or hormone-like factors by tumor cells. Autoantibodies elicited by tumor antigens that cross-react with normal tissues. | Presence of a carcinoma, particularly small cell lung carcinoma. | Tumor cells synthesize and secrete biologically active substances (e.g., ADH, ACTH). In other cases (e.g., Lambert-Eaton syndrome), tumor antigens trigger an autoimmune response where antibodies cross-react with similar structures in the nervous system, causing muscle weakness. | - | - | - | Can antedate the diagnosis of the tumor. Symptoms depend on the specific syndrome: **Hyponatremia** (from ADH) **Cushing syndrome** (from ACTH) **Hypercalcemia** (from parathormone, PTHrP) **Gynecomastia** (from gonadotropins) **Carcinoid syndrome** (diarrhea, flushing, cyanosis) **Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome** (muscle weakness) **Clubbing** of fingers. | Elevated serum levels of specific hormones (ADH, ACTH).

Associated with hypercoagulable states (Trousseau syndrome). | Treatment of the underlying cancer. |
| **Bronchial Asthma** A heterogeneous disease characterized by chronic airway inflammation and variable expiratory airflow obstruction, causing wheezing and cough from reversible bronchoconstriction. | **Atopic**: Environmental allergens (dusts, pollens, dander). **Non-Atopic**: Viral infections (rhinovirus), pollutants. **Drug-Induced**: Aspirin, NSAIDs. **Occupational**: Fumes, dusts, chemicals. | Genetic predisposition for atopy. Family history of asthma, allergic rhinitis, or eczema. Exposure to allergens or pollutants. Viral respiratory infections in young children. | An exaggerated **Th2 response** to harmless antigens.  **1. Sensitization:** Th2 cells release IL-4 (for IgE production), IL-5 (activates eosinophils), and IL-13 (mucus secretion, IgE production). IgE binds mast cells.  **2. Early Phase:** Re-exposure causes mast cell degranulation, releasing leukotrienes, acetylcholine, histamine. This causes bronchoconstriction, mucus production, vasodilation. **3. Late Phase:** Recruitment of leukocytes (eosinophils, neutrophils) perpetuates inflammation.  **Airway remodeling** occurs over time. | Multigenic.  • Locus on chromosome **5q** near gene cluster for cytokines **IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13** and the **IL-4 receptor**. Polymorphisms in **IL13** have strong association. • Class II **HLA** alleles. • Variants in genes for **IL-33** and its receptor ST2. • Variants in the gene for **TSLP**. | In fatal cases, lungs are overinflated with small areas of atelectasis. Bronchi and bronchioles are occluded by thick, tenacious mucus plugs. | **Airway Remodeling**: • Thickening of airway wall. • **Sub-basement membrane fibrosis** (type I and III collagens). • Increased vascularity. • Enlarged submucosal glands and more goblet cells. • Hypertrophy/hyperplasia of bronchial muscle. • Eosinophil-rich inflammatory infiltrate. **Special findings**: In sputum or BAL, find **Curschmann spirals** (mucus plugs), eosinophils, and **Charcot-Leyden crystals** (from eosinophil protein galectin-10). | Episodic wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough, varying in intensity, often worse at night. Patients may be asymptomatic between attacks. | Demonstration of reversible airflow obstruction (spirometry). Eosinophilia in peripheral blood. High total serum IgE. **RASTs** detect specific IgE. Skin tests show immediate wheal-and-flare reaction. Sputum analysis for eosinophils, Curschmann spirals, Charcot-Leyden crystals. | Based on triggers: 1. **Atopic Asthma** 2. **Non-Atopic Asthma** 3. **Drug-Induced Asthma** 4. **Occupational Asthma** | **Acute severe asthma (status asthmaticus)**: A severe, unremitting attack that can be fatal. Long-term, airway remodeling may cause irreversible airway obstruction. | Therapy based on severity. Centerpieces are bronchodilators, glucocorticoids, and leukotriene antagonists. For severe asthma, biologic therapies targeting inflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-5 blocking antibodies) are available. |
| **Bronchiectasis** A disorder with permanent dilation of bronchi and bronchioles caused by destruction of smooth muscle and elastic tissue from chronic necrotizing infections. | Caused by conditions leading to chronic infection and obstruction.  • Severe necrotizing pneumonia. • Bronchial obstruction (tumor, foreign body). • Congenital/hereditary conditions: cystic fibrosis, intralobar sequestration, immunodeficiency, primary ciliary dyskinesia (**Kartagener syndrome**). • Immune disorders: rheumatoid arthritis, SLE. • **Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)**.  • Idiopathic. | Cystic fibrosis, immunodeficiency, conditions causing airway obstruction. Asthma or cystic fibrosis for ABPA. | Obstruction and infection are key. A defect in airway clearance, from obstruction or impaired mucociliary function (e.g., cystic fibrosis), allows chronic bacterial infections. These infections destroy supporting smooth muscle and elastic tissue, causing permanent bronchial dilation. Smaller bronchioles are often obliterated by fibrosis (**bronchiolitis obliterans**). | Mutations causing primary ciliary dyskinesia (e.g., in **dynein** proteins). Genes associated with cystic fibrosis (**CFTR**). | Usually affects lower lobes bilaterally. Airways are dilated and can be followed almost to the pleural surfaces. On cut surface, dilated bronchi appear cystic and are filled with mucopurulent secretions. | Active cases show intense acute and chronic inflammation in bronchial walls, with epithelial ulceration. Squamous metaplasia can occur. Necrosis can form a lung abscess. Chronic cases show fibrosis of bronchial walls and peribronchiolar fibrosis. Sputum may contain **Haemophilus influenzae** or **Pseudomonas aeruginosa**. | Severe, persistent cough with expectoration of foul-smelling, sometimes bloody sputum. Dyspnea and orthopnea in severe cases. Hemoptysis can be massive. Symptoms are episodic. Cough is frequent in the morning. | Clinical signs supported by imaging (CT scan) showing dilated airways. Sputum culture to identify organisms. For ABPA: high serum IgE, antibodies to Aspergillus. | - | Obstructive respiratory insufficiency, marked dyspnea, cyanosis. Cor pulmonale, brain abscesses, and amyloidosis are potential complications. Lung abscess. | Antibiotics, physical therapy. |
| **Pneumonia** An infection of the lung parenchyma. | Most common cause of community-acquired acute pneumonia is **Streptococcus pneumoniae**. Others include Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella pneumophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and viruses. | Extremes of age. Chronic diseases (CHF, COPD, diabetes). Immunodeficiency. Decreased or absent splenic function. Impaired defense mechanisms (loss of cough reflex, mucociliary dysfunction). Hospitalization. | Results when defense mechanisms are impaired. Bacterial invasion causes alveoli to fill with inflammatory exudate, causing consolidation.  **Classic Stages of Lobar Pneumonia:** 1. **Congestion**: Lung is heavy, boggy, red. Vascular engorgement, intra-alveolar edema with few neutrophils and bacteria. 2. **Red Hepatization**: Massive confluent exudation with neutrophils, red cells, and fibrin filling alveolar spaces. Lobe is red, firm, airless, with a liver-like consistency. 3. **Gray Hepatization**: Progressive disintegration of red cells, persistence of a fibrinosuppurative exudate. Lobe becomes grayish-brown. 4. **Resolution**: Exudate is broken down enzymatically and resorbed, ingested by macrophages, coughed up, or organized by fibroblasts. | Germline mutations in **MyD88** are associated with destructive pneumococcal pneumonias. | **Lobar Pneumonia**: Consolidation of a large portion or an entire lobe. **Bronchopneumonia**: Patchy consolidation, often multilobar and bilateral, especially basal. Lesions are slightly elevated, dry, granular, gray-red to yellow. | **Lobar Pneumonia**: All alveoli in the affected area are in the same inflammatory stage. **Bronchopneumonia**: Foci of acute suppurative inflammation with neutrophil-rich exudate in bronchi, bronchioles, and adjacent alveoli. | Abrupt onset of high fever, shaking chills, cough producing mucopurulent sputum, occasionally hemoptysis.

Supportive care. Pneumococcal vaccines for prevention. |
| **Viral Pneumonia** Pneumonia caused by a virus, typically causing an interstitial inflammatory reaction. | Influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses. | Extremes of age, malnutrition, alcoholism, underlying debilitating illnesses, immunosuppression. | Viruses attach to and enter respiratory lining cells, causing cell death and inflammation. This damages local defenses like mucociliary clearance, predisposing to bacterial superinfections. Severe cases can lead to ARDS. For influenza, **antigenic drift** (mutations) causes epidemics, while **antigenic shift** (recombination) causes pandemics. | - | Involvement can be patchy or involve whole lobes. Affected areas are red-blue and congested. Pleuritis is infrequent. | Predominantly an **interstitial inflammatory reaction** in the alveolar walls. Septa are widened, edematous, with a mononuclear infiltrate (lymphocytes, macrophages). In severe cases (ARDS), pink **hyaline membranes** line the alveolar walls. | Varied course. Major manifestations can be fever, headache, and myalgia, with symptoms out of proportion to scant physical findings. | Clinical picture. PCR tests for viral RNA are common for diagnosis. | Classified by causative virus (e.g., Influenza pneumonia). | **Bacterial superinfection** is a common and serious complication. Can lead to ARDS. | Supportive measures. Antiviral agents for specific viruses (e.g., influenza). Preventive vaccines (e.g., influenza). |
| **Bronchopneumonia** A pattern of pneumonia with patchy consolidation of the lung. | Various bacteria, including S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, Klebsiella, etc. | General risk factors for pneumonia. | Inflammation originates in bronchi/bronchioles and spreads to adjacent alveoli, creating consolidated patches. These may become confluent to produce lobar consolidation. | - | Consolidated areas of acute suppurative inflammation. Often multilobar and bilateral and basal. Lesions are slightly elevated, dry, granular, gray-red to yellow. | Neutrophil-rich exudate fills bronchi, bronchioles, and adjacent alveolar spaces. | General symptoms of pneumonia: fever, chills, mucopurulent cough. | Chest radiograph shows focal opacities. | A morphological classification. | Abscess formation, empyema, bacteremic dissemination. | Antibiotics. |
| **Lobar Pneumonia** A pattern of pneumonia with consolidation of a large portion of a lobe or an entire lobe. | Classic cause is **Streptococcus pneumoniae**. Also Klebsiella pneumoniae. | General risk factors for pneumonia. | Rapid spread of organisms through the lung via pores of Kohn, leading to a uniform inflammatory response throughout the lobe. Evolves through four stages: **1. Congestion**, **2. Red Hepatization**, **3. Gray Hepatization**, **4. Resolution**. | - | Affected lobe is consolidated. In **red hepatization**, the lobe is red, firm, and airless. In **gray hepatization**, it is grayish-brown. | **Congestion**: vascular engorgement, intra-alveolar edema.  **Red Hepatization**: exudate of neutrophils, RBCs, and fibrin.  **Gray Hepatization**: disintegration of RBCs, persistence of fibrinosuppurative exudate.  **Resolution**: enzymatic breakdown of exudate. | Abrupt onset of high fever, shaking chills, productive cough, pleuritic chest pain. | Chest radiograph shows radiopacity of the entire affected lobe. | A morphological classification. | Abscess formation, empyema, bacteremic dissemination.

| **Emphysema** Irreversible enlargement of the airspaces distal to the terminal bronchiole, with destruction of their walls. | Tobacco smoke is the major cause. Air pollutants. Genetic deficiency of **α1-antitrypsin**. | Heavy cigarette smoking. α1-antitrypsin deficiency (PiZZ genotype). Genetic polymorphisms. | Driven by a **protease-antiprotease imbalance** and **oxidative stress**.  1. Inhaled irritants cause inflammation, attracting neutrophils and macrophages.  2. Inflammatory cells release proteases (elastase) that destroy elastic tissue.  3. Oxidants from smoke and inflammatory cells damage cells and inhibit antiprotease activity.  4. Loss of elastic tissue reduces radial traction on small airways, causing them to collapse during expiration, leading to airflow obstruction. | • Deficiency of α1-antitrypsin, encoded by the proteinase inhibitor (**Pi**) locus. The **Z allele** is associated with very low serum levels.  • Genetic variants in **NRF2** (an oxidant sensor). | Voluminous lungs, often overlapping the heart. In centriacinar type, upper lungs are more affected. Large alveoli are visible. Apical blebs or bullae may be present. | Abnormally large alveoli separated by thin septa. Loss of attachments between alveoli and small airways. Enlarged pores of Kohn. Decrease in capillary bed area. | Presents with dyspnea. The classic "**pink puffer**" is barrel-chested, dyspneic with prolonged expiration, and breathes through pursed lips. Cough is often slight with scanty sputum. Weight loss is common. | Spirometry shows an FEV1/FVC ratio < 0.7. Chest radiograph shows hyperinflation.

| **Asbestosis** Parenchymal interstitial fibrosis caused by inhalation of asbestos fibers. | Inhalation of asbestos fibers. | Occupational exposure (mining, manufacturing, insulation). Family members of asbestos workers. Smoking greatly increases the risk of lung carcinoma. | Asbestos fibers are phagocytosed by macrophages, which activates the **inflammasome** and releases proinflammatory and fibrogenic mediators. **Amphibole** fibers are more pathogenic than **chrysotile** as they penetrate deeper. Fibers are directly toxic to parenchymal cells. Long-term deposition leads to generalized interstitial fibrosis. Asbestos acts as a **tumor initiator and promoter**. | - | Fibrosis begins in lower lobes and subpleurally. Scarring distorts architecture, creating honeycombing. **Pleural plaques** (dense, often calcified collagen) are the most common manifestation, found on parietal pleura and diaphragm. | Diffuse pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. The hallmark is the presence of **asbestos bodies**: golden brown, fusiform rods with a translucent center (an asbestos fiber coated with iron-protein). Also called **ferruginous bodies**. Fibrosis pattern is similar to UIP. | Dyspnea, initially on exertion, is the first manifestation. Cough may be present. | Chest x-ray shows irregular linear densities, particularly in lower lobes, progressing to a honeycomb pattern. Pleural plaques are seen as circumscribed densities. | Asbestos exposure diseases: 1. Parenchymal interstitial fibrosis (asbestosis) 2. Pleural plaques or diffuse fibrosis 3.

| **Silicosis** A lung disease caused by inhalation of proinflammatory crystalline silicon dioxide (silica). | Inhalation of crystalline silicon dioxide (silica), most commonly quartz. | Occupational exposure: mining, sandblasting, stone cutting, metal casting. | Phagocytosis of silica crystals by macrophages activates the **inflammasome**, stimulating release of mediators, particularly **IL-1** and **IL-18**. This leads to recruitment of inflammatory cells and activation of fibroblasts, causing collagen deposition and fibrosis. Crystalline forms are more fibrogenic than amorphous forms. | - | Early stages: tiny, pale to blackened nodules in hilar lymph nodes and upper lung zones. Progresses to coalescent, hard, collagenous scars. Can cause progressive massive fibrosis. Fibrotic lesions in hilar nodes may show **eggshell calcification**. | The hallmark lesion has a central area of whorled collagen fibers with a peripheral zone of dust-laden macrophages. Polarized microscopy reveals weakly birefringent silicate particles. | Slow and insidious onset. Shortness of breath develops late, with progressive massive fibrosis. Disease may worsen even after exposure stops. | Chest radiograph shows fine nodularity in upper lung zones. **Eggshell calcification** in hilar lymph nodes is a characteristic finding. | - | **Increased susceptibility to tuberculosis**. Increased risk of **lung cancer**. Progressive massive fibrosis. | Supportive care. No treatment to stop progression. |
| **Ghon's Complex** A lesion seen in the lung of someone with primary tuberculosis, consisting of a calcified focus of infection (Ghon focus) and an associated lymph node. (Note: Detailed information on tuberculosis and Ghon's complex is not available in the provided text.) | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| **Malignant Mesothelioma** A malignant tumor arising from mesothelial cells of the pleura or other serosal surfaces. | Heavy exposure to **asbestos** is the primary cause. | Occupational asbestos exposure. Long latent period. **Risk is not increased by smoking.** Individuals with germline BAP1 mutations have a markedly elevated risk. | Involves asbestos fibers reaching the pleura, leading to the development of driver mutations in tumor suppressor genes, particularly BAP1 and NF2, and homozygous deletion of CDKN2A. | • Homozygous deletion of **CDKN2A** gene. • Driver mutations in **NF2** (neurofibromatosis-2) gene. • Driver mutations in **BAP1** gene. | A diffuse lesion spreading widely in the pleural space. The lung becomes ensheathed by a thick layer of soft, gelatinous, grayish-pink tumor tissue. Associated with extensive pleural effusion. | **Epithelioid type**: Cuboidal, columnar, or flattened cells in tubular or papillary structures. **Sarcomatoid type**: Resembles fibrosarcoma. **Biphasic type**: Contains both patterns. **Immunohistochemistry** is key: Positive for **keratin, calretinin, WT-1, cytokeratin 5/6, and podoplanin**. Negative for Claudin4. | Chest pain, dyspnea, and recurrent pleural effusions. | Imaging showing pleural thickening and effusion. Cytology of pleural fluid. Biopsy with immunohistochemical staining is diagnostic. | **Histologic Types:** 1. Epithelioid 2. Sarcomatoid 3. Biphasic (mixed) | Direct invasion of thoracic structures. Metastatic spread to hilar lymph nodes, liver, and other organs. Poor prognosis. | Aggressive therapy: extrapleural pneumonectomy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy. |
| **Pneumoconiosis** A group of non-neoplastic, chronic fibrosing lung diseases from inhalation of dusts, fumes, and vapors. | Inhalation of mineral dusts (coal, silica, asbestos), organic dusts (moldy hay, cotton), and chemical fumes. | Occupational exposure. Duration and concentration of exposure. Particle size (1-5 µm is most dangerous). Particle solubility. Impaired mucociliary clearance. | Central role for **pulmonary alveolar macrophages**.  1. Dust particles are inhaled.  2. Macrophages phagocytose particles.  3. This interaction can trigger the **inflammasome**.  4. Macrophages release proinflammatory and fibrogenic cytokines (TNF, IL-1, TGF-β), which promote inflammation and stimulate fibroblasts to produce collagen, leading to fibrosis. | - | Varies with the disease. Generally involves nodules, fibrosis, scarring. May see progressive massive fibrosis or honeycomb lung. | Varies with the disease. Features include dust-laden macrophages, fibrosis, and specific findings like coal macules (CWP), silicotic nodules (silicosis), or asbestos bodies (asbestosis). | Often insidious onset of dyspnea. May be asymptomatic for years. Cough. | Occupational history. Chest radiograph findings. Pulmonary function tests show a restrictive pattern. | **Major examples:** • Coal Workers' Pneumoconiosis (CWP) • Silicosis • Asbestosis • Berylliosis | Progressive respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale. Increased risk of other conditions depending on the dust (e.g., TB in silicosis; cancer in asbestosis). | Prevention by limiting exposure. Supportive care. |
| **Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)** A syndrome of progressive respiratory insufficiency from diffuse alveolar damage, with abrupt onset of hypoxemia and bilateral pulmonary edema without cardiac failure. | A complication of diverse disorders. Common causes include sepsis, diffuse pulmonary infections, gastric aspiration, and mechanical trauma. Others include pancreatitis, burns, drug overdose, transfusion (TRALI). | Predisposing conditions (sepsis, trauma, pneumonia). Chronic alcoholism and smoking increase risk. Genetic variants linked to inflammation and coagulation. | Initiated by injury to pneumocytes and pulmonary endothelium.  **1. Endothelial Activation:** Injury is sensed by macrophages which release TNF, or circulating mediators activate endothelium directly.  **2. Neutrophil Action:** Neutrophils adhere, enter alveoli, and release mediators (proteases, ROS), causing more damage. **Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)** contribute.  **3. Edema & Hyaline Membranes:** Capillary leakage causes protein-rich edema. Necrosis of type II pneumocytes impairs surfactant. Edema fluid and cell debris form **hyaline membranes**.  **4. Resolution/Organization:** Macrophages clear debris and release fibrogenic cytokines (TGF-β), leading to fibrosis. | Genetic variants that increase risk map to genes linked to **inflammation and coagulation**. | In the acute stage, lungs are heavy, firm, red, and boggy, showing congestion and edema. | The histologic manifestation is **diffuse alveolar damage (DAD)**. The characteristic finding is **alveolar hyaline membranes** lining alveolar walls. Also present are edema, scattered neutrophils and macrophages, and epithelial necrosis.

Classified by severity (mild, moderate, severe) based on oxygenation. | High mortality. Most deaths are due to sepsis or multiorgan failure. Survivors may develop interstitial fibrosis and chronic pulmonary disease. | Supportive care, including mechanical ventilation with high pressures. Treatment of the underlying condition. |
| **Chronic Bronchitis** Defined clinically as persistent cough with sputum production for at least 3 months in at least 2 consecutive years, without another identifiable cause. | Exposure to noxious inhaled substances, primarily tobacco smoke. Also dust from grain, cotton, silica, and air pollutants. | Long-standing cigarette smoking is the main risk factor. | **1. Mucus Hypersecretion:** Enlargement of submucosal glands in large airways and increased goblet cells in small airways, involving mediators like histamine and IL-13.  **2. Inflammation:** Chronic inflammation with neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages leads to small airway fibrosis.  **3. Infection:** Maintains the condition and causes exacerbations; ciliary action is impaired.  **4. Acquired CFTR dysfunction** from smoking leads to abnormal mucus. | - | Hyperemia, swelling, and edema of mucous membranes. Bronchi and bronchioles may contain excessive mucinous or mucopurulent secretions. | Chronic airway inflammation. Enlargement of mucus-secreting glands. Goblet cell hyperplasia.

Oxygen therapy. |
| **Goodpasture Syndrome** An autoimmune disease with kidney and lung injury from autoantibodies against collagen IV. A diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome. | Autoantibodies against the noncollagenous domain of the α3 chain of **collagen IV** in the basement membranes of glomeruli and alveoli. Trigger is unknown. | Active smokers. Association with certain HLA subtypes. | Pathogenic autoantibodies bind to basement membranes in glomeruli and alveoli, initiating inflammatory destruction. This causes rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and necrotizing hemorrhagic interstitial pneumonitis. T cells also contribute. | Associated with certain HLA subtypes (e.g., **HLA-DRB1\*1501** and **HLA-DRB1\*1502**). | Lungs are heavy, with areas of red-brown consolidation from diffuse hemorrhage. | Focal necrosis of alveolar walls with intra-alveolar hemorrhages. Hemosiderin-laden macrophages are present. **Special Stain**: Immunofluorescence shows characteristic **linear deposits of immunoglobulins** (IgG) and complement along septal and glomerular basement membranes. Kidneys show crescentic glomerulonephritis. | Begins with respiratory symptoms, principally hemoptysis. Followed by manifestations of glomerulonephritis (hematuria), leading to rapidly progressive renal failure. | Circulating anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies. Immunofluorescence of kidney or lung biopsy is diagnostic. | - | Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis leading to renal failure, which is the most common cause of death (uremia). | **Intensive plasmapheresis** (to remove antibodies). Simultaneous immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., steroids, cyclophosphamide). |

Immunosuppression. Bronchial obstruction. Intravenous drug use. | Introduction of organisms into the lung parenchyma. Aspiration causes pneumonia, which progresses to tissue necrosis and formation of a localized, walled-off area of suppuration. | - | Vary from millimeters to large cavities. Aspiration abscesses are often single and more common on the right. May be filled with suppurative debris or contain air if connected to an airway. Chronic cases have a fibrous wall. | The cardinal feature is **suppurative destruction of the lung parenchyma** within the central area of cavitation. | Cough, fever, and copious amounts of foul-smelling purulent or sanguineous sputum. Chest pain and weight loss are common. Clubbing of fingers and toes may appear. | Confirmed radiologically, showing a cavity often with an air-fluid level. Rule out underlying carcinoma. | **Mechanisms:** 1. Aspiration (most frequent) 2. Antecedent primary lung infection 3. Septic embolism 4. Neoplasia 5.

Often presents with metastatic disease or paraneoplastic syndromes. | Biopsy with histology and IHC is diagnostic. Imaging to determine disease extent. | A type of neuroendocrine tumor. | Most aggressive lung tumor, metastasizes widely. Most commonly associated with **ectopic hormone production** (paraneoplastic syndromes), especially **ADH** (hyponatremia) and **ACTH** (Cushing syndrome). | Very sensitive to radiation and chemotherapy. Despite good initial response, prognosis is poor for advanced disease. New therapies are being tested. |
| **Primary Atypical Pneumonia** A clinical syndrome of pneumonia with a more insidious onset than "typical" pneumonia. | Most common causes are **Mycoplasma pneumoniae**, Chlamydia spp., Coxiella burnetii, and various viruses. | Common in children and young adults; occurs in closed communities (schools, military camps). | The inflammation is largely confined to the interstitium (alveolar septa), rather than filling alveolar spaces with exudate. This causes a ventilation-perfusion mismatch. | - | Involvement may be patchy or involve whole lobes. Congestion. Pleuritis is infrequent. | Morphology is similar to viral pneumonia. Predominantly an **interstitial inflammatory reaction** in the alveolar walls, with a mononuclear infiltrate of lymphocytes and macrophages. | Varied course. May present as a "chest cold." Symptoms like fever, headache, myalgia may be more prominent than cough. Symptoms often out of proportion to physical findings. | Clinical picture. Serology for specific antibodies. PCR tests. | - | Usually mild and resolves spontaneously. | Antibiotics effective against atypical organisms (e.g., macrolides). Supportive care. |
| **Sarcoidosis** A systemic granulomatous disease of unknown cause, most commonly affecting lungs and hilar lymph nodes. | Unknown etiology. Thought to be a disordered immune response to an unidentified antigen in a genetically predisposed person. | Genetic predisposition. Association with certain HLA genotypes. | A cell-mediated immune response to an unidentified antigen.  1. Accumulation of **CD4+ T cells** in affected tissues.  2. Increased levels of **Th1-derived cytokines** like **IL-2** and **IFN-γ**, which drive T-cell expansion and macrophage activation.  3. Increased levels of other cytokines (IL-8, TNF) recruit cells and contribute to granuloma formation.  4. Results in the formation of **non-necrotizing granulomas**. | Association with certain human leukocyte antigen (**HLA**) genotypes (e.g., **HLA-A1** and **HLA-B8**). | **Lungs**: Advanced cases may have small nodules. **Lymph nodes** (hilar, mediastinal) are enlarged, discrete, sometimes calcified. **Spleen** may be enlarged. **Liver** may be enlarged. **Skin lesions** vary from nodules to plaques to erythema nodosum. | The hallmark is the **well-formed, non-necrotizing granuloma**, composed of aggregates of epithelioid macrophages, often with giant cells. Necrosis is unusual. Granulomas are distributed along lymphatics.  **Special findings**: **Schaumann bodies** (laminated concretions) and **asteroid bodies** (stellate inclusions) may be found in giant cells. | Diverse presentations. May be discovered incidentally. Insidious onset of respiratory symptoms (shortness of breath, cough) or constitutional symptoms (fever, fatigue, weight loss). Skin lesions (**erythema nodosum**), eye involvement (iritis), splenomegaly. | Diagnosis of exclusion. Chest radiograph showing **bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy** is classic. Bronchoscopic biopsy. Elevated CD4/CD8 ratio in BAL fluid. Systemic anergy to skin tests. | - | Unpredictable course. Can lead to permanent lung or visual impairment. A minority of patients succumb to progressive pulmonary fibrosis and **cor pulmonale**, or cardiac/CNS damage. Eye involvement can cause glaucoma and vision loss. **Mikulicz syndrome**. | Steroid therapy. |
