# [[NUTRITION AND HEALTH]] > Mention the causes and detrimental effects of nutritional anaemia. Describe the measures undertaken to combat anaemia among adolescents according to national Program.

### Causes of Nutritional Anaemia

Nutritional anaemia is a condition in which the hemoglobin content of blood is lower than normal due to a deficiency of one or more essential nutrients. The primary causes include:

**1. Inadequate Dietary Intake**
*   **Low Quantity/Quality:** Insufficient intake of iron-rich foods. This is common in populations subsisting on cereal-based diets with little animal protein.
*   **Nutrient Deficiencies:** Deficiency of [[Iron]], [[Folic Acid]] (Vitamin B9), and [[Vitamin B12]].

**2. Poor Bio-availability**
*   Even if dietary iron is seemingly adequate, absorption may be poor (often less than 5%).
*   **Inhibitors:** Presence of [[phytates]], oxalates, carbonates, phosphates, and dietary fiber in cereals and vegetables interfere with iron absorption.
*   **Inhibitors in Beverages:** Tannins in tea can inhibit absorption.

**3. Excessive Iron Loss (Blood Loss)**
*   **Parasitic Infestations:** Chronic blood loss due to [[Hookworm]] (Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus) and [[Malaria]].
*   **Physiological:** Excessive menstrual loss in women of reproductive age.
*   **Other Pathologies:** Bleeding peptic ulcers, hemorrhoids.

**4. Increased Demands**
*   **Physiological States:** Rapid growth phases during infancy, childhood, and adolescence increase the body's need for iron.
*   **Pregnancy:** High demand for fetal growth and expansion of maternal tissue.

### Detrimental Effects of Nutritional Anaemia

Anaemia is not just a disease entity but a syndrome with widespread consequences:

**1. Effects on Pregnancy and Mother**
*   **Mortality:** Increases the risk of maternal deaths (responsible for approx. 20-40% of maternal deaths in India).
*   **Morbidity:** Associated with abortions, premature births, [[Low Birth Weight]] (LBW) babies, and postpartum hemorrhage (PPH).

**2. Effects on Work Capacity**
*   Significant impairment of maximal work capacity and physical endurance.
*   Leads to lower economic productivity due to fatigue and lethargy.

**3. Effects on Infection**
*   Impaired **cell-mediated immunity** and reduced resistance to infections.
*   Anaemia can be both a cause and a result of recurrent infections.

**4. Effects on Children and Adolescents**
*   **Growth Failure:** Retarded physical growth.
*   **Cognitive Impairment:** Low IQ, short attention span, and poor scholastic performance.

### Measures to Combat Anaemia Among Adolescents (National Program)

The Government of India has implemented specific interventions targeting adolescents (10–19 years) under the **Weekly Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation ([[WIFS]])** programme and the **[[Anemia Mukt Bharat]] (AMB)** strategy.

#### 1. Weekly Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation (WIFS)
This programme targets both rural and urban adolescents (10–19 years), including school-going boys and girls and out-of-school girls.

**Key Interventions:**

*   **Supplements:** Administration of supervised weekly [[Iron-Folic Acid]] (IFA) supplements.
    *   **Dosage:** **100 mg Elemental Iron** and **500 mcg Folic Acid**.
    *   **Regimen:** One tablet per week (Fixed day approach, usually Monday).
    *   **Color of Tablet:** Blue.
*   **Deworming:** To control helminthic infestation which causes blood loss.
    *   **Drug:** [[Albendazole]] 400 mg.
    *   **Frequency:** Biannual (Twice a year).
*   **Screening:** Screening of target groups for moderate/severe anaemia and referral to appropriate health facilities.
*   **Information and Counseling:** Counseling on improving dietary intake (iron-rich foods) and preventing intestinal worm infestation.

#### 2. Anemia Mukt Bharat (6x6x6 Strategy)
Under the POSHAN Abhiyaan, this strategy targets adolescents as one of the 6 beneficiaries.

| Feature | Specification for Adolescents (10-19 Years) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Beneficiaries** | Adolescent Boys and Girls |
| **Intervention** | Prophylactic Iron Folic Acid Supplementation |
| **Dose** | 100 mg Elemental Iron + 500 mcg Folic Acid |
| **Frequency** | Weekly |
| **Tablet Color** | **Blue** |
| **Target** | Reduce anaemia prevalence by 3% points per year |

**Clinical Relevance:**
Adolescents often have poor dietary habits. Counseling should emphasize **vitamin C** intake (lemon, amla, guava) to enhance iron absorption and avoiding tea/coffee immediately after meals as they inhibit absorption.
