# Ophthalmia Neonatorum

### Definition
[[Ophthalmia Neonatorum]] (neonatal conjunctivitis) is defined as bilateral inflammation of the [[conjunctiva]] occurring in an infant less than **30 days old**.
*   Any discharge, even watery secretion, from an infant's eyes during the first week of life should be viewed with suspicion since tears are not secreted so early in life (tear production begins at 6 weeks).

### Etiology and Time of Onset
The causative agents can be identified based on the incubation period following birth.

| Causative Agent | Incubation Period | Clinical Characteristics | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Chemical** | **< 24 hours** (usually 6 hrs) | Mild conjunctival hyperaemia, watering. | Due to [[Silver nitrate]] (Credé’s method) or antibiotics used for prophylaxis. Self-limiting. |
| **Gonococcal** ([[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]) | **2–5 days** (Hyperacute) | Hyperacute, copious **purulent** discharge, marked chemosis, lid swelling. | Most severe form; can invade intact corneal epithelium causing perforation. |
| **Bacterial** (Other) | **4–7 days** | Mucopurulent discharge, lid edema. | *Staph. aureus*, *Strep. pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus*, *Pseudomonas*. |
| **Viral** ([[Herpes Simplex Virus]]) | **5–7 days** (or up to 2 weeks) | Blepharoconjunctivitis, keratitis, vesicular lesions on lid. | Usually HSV-2 from birth canal. |
| **Chlamydial** ([[Chlamydia trachomatis]]) | **1–2 weeks** (Most common) | Acute mucopurulent conjunctivitis, pseudomembranes. | Serotypes D–K (Inclusion conjunctivitis). Most common cause in developed countries. |

> **Clinical Implication:** The timing of the discharge is the most important initial clue to the etiology. "Chemical comes first, Chlamydia comes last."

### Modes of Infection
1.  **Prenatal (Before birth):** Rare; ascending infection through ruptured membranes (e.g., infected liquor amnii).
2.  **Natal (During birth):** Most common mode. Infection acquired from the infected birth canal (cervix/urethra) during vaginal delivery (e.g., Gonorrhea, Chlamydia, Herpes).
3.  **Postnatal (After birth):** Infection from soiled clothes, fingers, infected lochia, or during the first bath.

### Clinical Features

#### 1. Gonococcal Ophthalmia Neonatorum
*   **Onset:** Hyperacute (within 24–48 hours of birth).
*   **Symptoms:** Severe pain, tender eyelids.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Copious purulent discharge** (thick yellow pus) that reaccumulates seconds after cleaning.
    *   Marked **chemosis** (conjunctival swelling) and intense congestion.
    *   **Lid edema:** Lids are tense, swollen, and overhanging, making examination difficult.
    *   **Corneal involvement:** Because *N. gonorrhoeae* can penetrate intact corneal epithelium, there is a high risk of ulceration, perforation, and anterior staphyloma if untreated.
    *   [[Pseudomembrane]] formation may occur.

#### 2. Chlamydial Ophthalmia Neonatorum (Neonatal Inclusion Conjunctivitis)
*   **Onset:** 5–14 days after birth.
*   **Signs:**
    *   Mucopurulent discharge.
    *    papillary response (Note: **Follicles are absent** in neonates because the adenoid layer of the conjunctiva does not develop until 3 months of age).
    *   Pseudomembranes may form.
*   **Systemic Association:** May be associated with chlamydial otitis, rhinitis, or pneumonia.

#### 3. Herpes Simplex Conjunctivitis
*   **Onset:** 5–7 days.
*   **Signs:** Vesicular blepharitis, non-specific conjunctivitis. May involve the cornea (epithelial keratitis/dendrites).

### Diagnosis and Investigations
1.  **Conjunctival Cytology/Smears:**
    *   **Gram Stain:**
        *   *Gonococcal:* Gram-negative intracellular **diplococci** within polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
        *   *Other Bacteria:* Gram-positive cocci (Staph/Strep).
    *   **Giemsa Stain:**
        *   *Chlamydia:* Basophilic intracytoplasmic **inclusion bodies** (Halberstaedter-Prowazek bodies) in epithelial cells. polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes are present.
        *   *Viral:* Multinucleated giant cells (HSV).
2.  **Culture:**
    *   **Blood Agar/Chocolate Agar:** For bacteria (Gonococcus, Haemophilus).
    *   **McCoy Cell Culture:** Gold standard for Chlamydia.
3.  **PCR/Immunofluorescence:** Highly sensitive for Chlamydia and Viral causes.

### Complications
If untreated, ophthalmia neonatorum can lead to blindness.
1.  **Corneal Ulceration:** Especially in Gonococcal infection. Can lead to perforation, adherent leucoma, or [[anterior staphyloma]].
2.  **Endophthalmitis:** Spread of infection internally.
3.  **Secondary Glaucoma:** Due to anterior synechiae.
4.  **Nystagmus:** Development of fixation is impaired due to corneal opacities (sensory deprivation).
5.  **Systemic Complications:** Gonococcal arthritis, sepsis, meningitis; Chlamydial pneumonia.

### Prophylaxis
Preventive measures are crucial (obstetric asepsis and ocular prophylaxis).
1.  **Antenatal:** Treatment of maternal genital infections (gonorrhea/chlamydia).
2.  **Natal:** Aseptic delivery; cleaning the newborn's closed lids.
3.  **Postnatal (Ocular Prophylaxis):**
    *   **Povidone-Iodine (2.5%):** Effective against bacteria, fungi, and viruses.
    *   **Antibiotic Ointment:** 1% [[Tetracycline]] or 0.5% [[Erythromycin]] instilled immediately after birth.
    *   **Credé’s Method (Historical):** Instillation of 1 drop of 1% **Silver Nitrate**. *Disadvantage:* Causes chemical conjunctivitis in 90% of cases; largely obsolete now.

### Treatment

Treatment depends on the causative organism identified by smear/culture. **In severe cases (corneal involvement), hospitalization is required.**

| Etiology | Systemic Therapy | Topical Therapy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gonococcal** | **Ceftriaxone** (25-50 mg/kg IV/IM single dose) OR Cefotaxime. <br> *Must treat parents.* | **Saline lavage** (hourly to remove pus). <br> **Bacitracin** or Erythromycin ointment. <br> **Atropine** (if cornea involved). |
| **Chlamydial** | **Oral Erythromycin** (50 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses for 14 days) OR Azithromycin suspension. <br> *Systemic Rx essential to prevent pneumonia.* | **Tetracycline 1%** or Erythromycin ointment QID. |
| **Other Bacterial** | Usually not required unless severe. | Broad-spectrum antibiotics (Tobramycin, Neomycin-Bacitracin) for 2 weeks. |
| **Herpes Simplex** | Systemic **Acyclovir** (if systemic involvement/encephalitis suspected). | **Acyclovir 3%** ointment 5 times/day. |
| **Chemical** | None. | Self-limiting (resolves in 24-48 hours). |
