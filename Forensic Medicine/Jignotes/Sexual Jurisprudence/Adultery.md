# [[Sexual Jurisprudence]] > Adultery

### Adultery

**Definition**
Adultery is defined as voluntary [[sexual intercourse]] between a married person and a person (married or unmarried) other than their lawful spouse during the subsistence of the marriage. It is a consensual act, unlike rape.

### Legal Status in India

The legal stance on adultery has undergone significant changes in the Indian Legal System:

*   **Current Status (BNS):** Under the **Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS)**, adultery is **not punishable** as a criminal offense. It has been decriminalized. However, it remains a valid ground for civil actions, such as **divorce** or judicial separation,.
*   **Historical Context (IPC):** Previously, under **Section 497 of the [[Indian Penal Code]] (IPC)**, adultery was a criminal offence. It defined adultery as a man having sexual intercourse with a person whom he knows or has reason to believe to be the wife of another man, without the consent or connivance of that man. The wife was not punishable as an abettor. This section has been struck down by the Supreme Court.

### Medical Ethics and Professional Misconduct

While adultery is no longer a crime for the general public, it holds strict disciplinary consequences for medical professionals under the code of **Medical Ethics**.

**1. Professional Misconduct (Infamous Conduct)**
Adultery is considered **[[Serious Professional Misconduct]]** (Infamous Conduct in a Professional Respect). If a registered medical practitioner abuses their professional position to commit adultery or maintain an improper association with a patient, they are liable for disciplinary action,,.

*   **Rule:** A physician must not allow their professional relationship to degenerate into a sexual one.
*   **The Maxim:** *"A patient must not become a mistress, but a mistress may become a patient"*.
*   **Punishment:** If found guilty by the [[State Medical Council]], the doctor’s name may be removed from the medical register (Penal Erasure) temporarily or permanently.

**2. The "6 A's" of Professional Misconduct**
Adultery is one of the classic "6 A's" that constitute infamous conduct,:
1.  **A**dultery (in professional relationship)
2.  **A**dvertising
3.  **A**bortion (Criminal)
4.  **A**ssociation (with unqualified persons/Covering)
5.  **A**ddiction
6.  **A**lcohol (Working under influence)

**Mnemonic:** **"6 A's"** for Professional Misconduct.

### Medicolegal Aspects

**1. Divorce and Nullity of Marriage**
Adultery is a statutory ground for divorce or judicial separation under personal laws (e.g., Hindu Marriage Act). Medical evidence may be sought to prove that sexual intercourse took place with a third party.

**2. Legitimacy and Paternity**
*   Adultery often leads to disputes regarding the **[[legitimacy]]** of a child.
*   A child born during the continuance of a valid marriage is presumed legitimate unless non-access to the husband can be proved.
*   **DNA Profiling:** This is the most conclusive method to prove or disprove biological [[paternity]] in cases where adultery is alleged to have resulted in pregnancy.

**3. Artificial Insemination and Adultery**
*   **Artificial Insemination by Donor (AID):** If a woman undergoes AID without her husband's consent, it does **not** amount to adultery legally because there is no physical union or sexual intercourse involved. However, it constitutes a valid ground for **divorce** due to mental cruelty,.
*   **Incest:** Sexual intercourse between close blood relatives (who are prohibited from marrying) is incest, not necessarily adultery, though it can be both if one party is married.

### Medical Examination

Unlike rape, there is no specific "adultery kit" or standard emergency examination unless there is a dispute regarding recent intercourse or paternity.
*   **Proof of Venereal Disease:** If one spouse contracts a [[Sexually Transmitted Disease]] (STD) like syphilis or gonorrhea and transmits it to the other, it can serve as corroborative evidence of adultery/infidelity, provided the innocent spouse was previously healthy.
*   **Proof of Pregnancy/Delivery:** In cases of long-term non-access of the husband, evidence of recent [[pregnancy]] or [[delivery]] in the wife serves as proof of adultery.
