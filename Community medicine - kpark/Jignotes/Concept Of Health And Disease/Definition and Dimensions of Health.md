# [[Concept Of Health And Disease]] > Definition and Dimensions of Health

### WHO Definition of Health

The widely accepted definition of health was given by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the preamble to its constitution (1948):

> **"Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely an absence of disease or infirmity."**,

**Updates and Critique:**
*   **Extension:** In recent years, this definition has been amplified to include the ability to lead a **[[socially and economically productive life]]**.,
*   **Criticism:** The definition is often criticized for being an **idealistic goal** rather than a realistic proposition. It treats health as a "state" rather than a dynamic process of continuous adjustment to changing demands of living.,
*   **Operational Definition:** For measurement purposes, health is often viewed in two orders:
    1.  **Broad sense:** Condition expressing adequate functioning of the organism in genetic/environmental conditions.
    2.  **Narrow sense:** No obvious evidence of disease and organs functioning adequately (equilibrium/homeostasis).,

### Dimensions of Health

Health is **[[multidimensional]]**. While the WHO definition specifies three (Physical, Mental, Social), as knowledge grows, other dimensions like Spiritual, Emotional, and Vocational are increasingly recognized.,

**Mnemonic:** **PSM** is **ESSENCE** of Health
*   **P** - Physical
*   **S** - Social
*   **M** - Mental
*   **E** - Emotional
*   **S** - Spiritual
*   **S** - Socio-economic
*   **E** - Environmental
*   **N** - Nutritional
*   **C** - Cultural
*   **E** - Educational

#### 1. Physical Dimension
This is the most easily understood dimension. It implies the notion of **[[perfect functioning]]** of the body.
*   **Concept:** Every cell and every organ is functioning at optimum capacity and in perfect harmony with the rest of the body.,
*   **Signs of Physical Health:** Good complexion, clean skin, bright eyes, lustrous hair, good appetite, sound sleep, regular bowel/bladder habits, and coordinated body movements.
*   **Assessment:**
    *   Self-assessment of overall health.
    *   Inquiry into symptoms of ill-health and risk factors.
    *   Clinical examination.
    *   Biochemical and laboratory investigations.,

#### 2. Mental Dimension
This is **not merely the absence of mental illness**. It is a state of balance between the individual and the surrounding world.,
*   **Concept:** A state of harmony between oneself and others; coexistence between the realities of the self, other people, and the environment.
*   **Characteristics of a Mentally Healthy Person:**
    *   Free from internal conflicts; not at "war" with himself.
    *   Well-adjusted (gets along well with others).
    *   Searches for identity.
    *   Strong sense of self-esteem.
    *   Knows his own needs, problems, and goals (self-control).
    *   Faces problems and tries to solve them intelligently (Coping).
*   **Distinction:** Mental health is often seen as "knowing" or cognition, while emotional health relates to "feeling".

#### 3. Social Dimension
Social well-being implies harmony and integration within the individual, between each individual and other members of society, and between individuals and the world in which they live.
*   **Concept:** It focuses on the **[[quantity and quality of an individual's interpersonal ties]]** and the extent of involvement with the community.
*   **Components:**
    *   Possession of social skills.
    *   Social functioning.
    *   Ability to see oneself as a member of a larger society.,
*   **Rooting:** It is rooted in a positive material environment (financial/residential) and a positive human environment (social network).

#### 4. Spiritual Dimension
This refers to that part of the individual which reaches out and strives for **meaning and purpose in life**.,
*   **Concept:** It is the intangible "something" that transcends physiology and psychology.
*   **Includes:** Integrity, principles, ethics, commitment to some higher being, and belief in concepts not subject to "state of the art" explanation.,

#### 5. Emotional Dimension
Historically linked with mental health, but now viewed distinctively.
*   **Concept:** Relates to **"feeling"**.
*   **Clinical Relevance:** Mental health is seen as "knowing" (cognition), whereas emotional health represents the affective state.,

#### 6. Vocational Dimension
Work constitutes a major part of life. When work is fully adapted to human goals, capacities, and limitations, it promotes physical and mental health.
*   **Importance:** Goal achievement and self-realization in work are sources of satisfaction and enhanced **[[self-esteem]]**.
*   **Impact:** Sudden loss of a job or mandatory retirement can severely impact this dimension. For many, it is not just income, but "life success".,

**Clinical Relevance:**
Understanding these dimensions is crucial for the **[[Holistic Concept]]** of health. A physician cannot treat a patient effectively by looking only at the biological/physical aspect (the germ theory). One must consider the patient's social network, mental state, and economic ability to lead a productive life to ensure true well-being.
