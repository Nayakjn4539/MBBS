# [[Glaucoma]] > Pseudoexfoliation Glaucoma

# Pseudoexfoliation Glaucoma (Glaucoma Capsulare)

[[Pseudoexfoliation Glaucoma]] is a type of secondary [[Open Angle Glaucoma]] caused by the obstruction of the [[Trabecular meshwork]] by fibrillar, amyloid-like exfoliative material. It is associated with **Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome (PEX/PES)**, a generalized disorder of the basement membranes.

### Etiology and Genetics
*   **Genetic Factor:** Strong association with **LOX-1 gene** (Lysyl Oxidase-like 1) mutation.
*   **Nature of Material:** Production of grey, dandruff-like, aberrant basement membrane material ([[Pseudoexfoliative material]]).
*   **Epidemiology:**
    *   It is the **most common cause** of identifiable **secondary open-angle glaucoma** worldwide.
    *   Usually affects the elderly (Age > 60 years).
    *   **Laterality:** Mostly **unilateral** or asymmetric presentation (though the genetic defect is bilateral).

### Pathogenesis
The mechanism of raised [[Intraocular Pressure]] (IOP) is primarily **mechanical blockage**:
1.  **Clogging:** The exfoliative material (flakes) and pigment released from the iris are deposited in the [[Trabecular meshwork]].
2.  **Dysfunction:** There is degenerative change in the anterior uvea and endothelial cells of the trabeculum.
3.  **Resistance:** This leads to increased resistance to aqueous outflow $\rightarrow$ Raised IOP $\rightarrow$ [[Glaucomatous Optic Neuropathy]].

> **Note:** While predominantly an open-angle mechanism, the laxity of zonules can allow the lens to move forward, occasionally causing a secondary **Angle Closure Glaucoma**.

### Clinical Features (The Signs)

The diagnosis is clinical, based on the observation of whitish material on anterior segment structures.

| Structure | Clinical Findings |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Lens** (Anterior Capsule) | **[[Target Sign]]** (Bull's eye pattern). Three zones are seen:<br>1. **Central disc:** Translucent film of material.<br>2. **Clear intermediate zone:** Created by the rubbing of the iris pupil margin against the lens.<br>3. **Peripheral granular zone:** Peripheral band of deposits. |
| **Pupil / Iris** | **[[Frocks]]** or dandruff-like whitish deposits at the pupillary margin.<br>**Poor Mydriasis:** The pupil dilates poorly due to fibrosis/infiltration of the sphincter (rigid iris).<br>**Iris atrophy:** Peripupillary transillumination defects (moth-eaten appearance). |
| **Cornea** | Deposition of flakes/pigment on the corneal endothelium.<br>Can resemble [[Krukenberg spindle]] (pigment dispersion). |
| **Angle (Gonioscopy)** | **[[Sampaolesi line]]**: Pigment deposition anterior to [[Schwalbe's line]].<br>Hyperpigmented trabecular meshwork (often patchy).<br>Narrow angles may be seen due to lens instability. |

### Clinical Implications in Cataract Surgery
Patients with Pseudoexfoliation syndrome are **high-risk candidates** for [[Cataract Surgery]] due to:
*   **Zonular Weakness/Dialysis:** The exfoliative material weakens the lens zonules. There is a high risk of:
    *   [[Lens Subluxation]].
    *   **Phacodonesis** (tremulousness of the lens).
    *   Posterior capsular rupture.
    *   Nucleus drop into the vitreous.
    *   Late IOL dislocation (Sunset syndrome).
*   **Poor Pupillary Dilation:** Makes surgical maneuvering difficult (may require iris hooks or expansion rings).

### Diagnosis
1.  **Slit Lamp Examination:** To visualize the [[Target sign]] (best seen after dilation) and pupillary deposits.
2.  **[[Gonioscopy]]:** Essential to identify angle pigmentation and rule out angle closure.
3.  **IOP Measurement:** Often very high and liable to large fluctuations.
4.  **Fundoscopy/Perimetry:** To assess [[Optic Disc Cupping]] and visual field defects (same as POAG).

### Management
The treatment protocol follows the lines of **Primary Open Angle Glaucoma ([[POAG]])**, but Pseudoexfoliation glaucoma is often more aggressive and harder to control.

#### 1. Medical Therapy
*   First line: **Prostaglandin analogues** (e.g., [[Latanoprost]]) or **Beta-blockers** (e.g., [[Timolol]]).
*   Response is usually good initially but failure rates are higher than in POAG over time.

#### 2. Laser Therapy
*   **[[Laser Trabeculoplasty]] (Argon or Selective):**
    *   It is **very effective** in Pseudoexfoliation glaucoma due to the high pigmentation of the trabecular meshwork (pigment absorbs laser energy well).
    *   Indications: When medical therapy is insufficient or compliance is poor.

#### 3. Surgical Therapy
*   **[[Trabeculectomy]]:** The gold standard filtration surgery if medical/laser therapy fails.
*   **Trabectome / MIGS:** Newer minimally invasive options.
*   **Cataract Extraction:** Removing the lens alone may result in a modest drop in IOP and resolves the issue of phacodonesis, but glaucoma surgery is often needed concurrently.

### Summary Comparison: POAG vs Pseudoexfoliation

| Feature | Primary Open Angle Glaucoma | Pseudoexfoliation Glaucoma |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Material** | Absent | Whitish flakes present |
| **Pigmentation** | Moderate | Heavy (Sampaolesi line) |
| **IOP** | Moderately elevated | Often very high/Fluctuating |
| **Course** | Slowly progressive | More aggressive/Rapid progression |
| **Response to Laser** | Moderate | Good (due to pigment) |
| **Cataract Surgery** | Standard risk | High risk (Zonular weakness) |
