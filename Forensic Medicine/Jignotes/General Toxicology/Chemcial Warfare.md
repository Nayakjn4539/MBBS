# [[General Toxicology]] > Chemcial Warfare

### Chemical Warfare

**Definition**
[[Chemical Warfare Agents]] (CWAs) are chemical substances, whether gaseous, liquid, or solid, which are used to cause death, injury, or temporary incapacitation to humans or animals because of their direct toxic effects. They are distinguished from biological weapons (which use living organisms or toxins) and nuclear weapons.

### Classification of Chemical Warfare Agents

CWAs are classified based on their physiological effects and target organs:

| Class | Agents (Examples) | Mechanism/Effect | Signs & Symptoms |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Nerve Agents]]** | Tabun (GA)<br>Sarin (GB)<br>Soman (GD)<br>VX | Irreversible inhibition of **[[Acetylcholinesterase]]**. Leads to accumulation of Acetylcholine. | **Cholinergic Crisis:** Miosis, salivation, convulsions, respiratory paralysis. |
| **Vesicants**<br>(Blister Agents) | [[Mustard Gas]] (Sulfur mustard)<br>Lewisite<br>Nitrogen mustard | Alkylating agents that damage DNA and proteins. Cause chemical burns. | Severe skin blisters, corneal damage, respiratory tract damage (pulmonary edema). |
| **Choking Agents**<br>(Pulmonary) | Phosgene (CG)<br>Chlorine<br>Chloropicrin | Irritation of alveoli and disruption of alveolar-capillary membrane. | Dyspnea, coughing, **[[Pulmonary Edema]]** (delayed onset), cyanosis ("Dry-land drowning"). |
| **Blood Agents**<br>(Systemic Asphyxiants) | [[Hydrogen Cyanide]] (AC)<br>Cyanogen Chloride (CK) | Inhibit **[[Cytochrome Oxidase]]** (ETC), preventing cellular oxygen utilization. | Bitter almond smell, cherry-red skin, histotoxic anoxia, rapid respiratory failure. |
| **Incapacitating Agents**<br>(Psychomimetic) | BZ (3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate)<br>LSD | Anticholinergic or hallucinogenic effects on CNS. | Delirium, hallucinations, confusion, dry skin, hyperthermia. |
| **Riot Control Agents**<br>(Lachrymators/Harassing) | CN (Mace)<br>CS gas (Tear gas)<br>OC (Pepper spray) | Intense sensory irritation of eyes and mucous membranes. | Tearing (lachrymation), blepharospasm, burning sensation, coughing. |

### Specific Agents and Management

#### 1. Nerve Agents (Organophosphates)
These are the most lethal CWAs. They are chemically similar to agricultural [[Organophosphates]] but vastly more potent.
*   **Examples:** Sarin (GB), Soman (GD), Tabun (GA), VX.
*   **Mechanism:** Phosphorylation of acetylcholinesterase enzyme $\rightarrow$ Accumulation of Acetylcholine at muscarinic and nicotinic receptors $\rightarrow$ Constant stimulation.
*   **Clinical Features (Mnemonic: DUMBELS):**
    *   **D**iarrhea, Diaphoresis (Sweating)
    *   **U**rination
    *   **M**iosis (Pin-point pupils)
    *   **B**radycardia, Bronchorrhea, Bronchospasm
    *   **E**mesis (Vomiting)
    *   **L**acrimation
    *   **S**alivation, Seizures
*   **Management:**
    *   **Decontamination:** Remove clothes, wash skin with soap and water or 0.5% hypochlorite.
    *   **Antidotes:**
        1.  **[[Atropine]]**: Blocks muscarinic effects. Dose: 2 mg IV/IM repeated every 5-10 mins until atropinization (drying of secretions).
        2.  **Oximes ([[Pralidoxime]]/2-PAM):** Regenerates the enzyme (must be given before "aging" occurs).
    *   **Auto-injectors (Soldier Kits):**
        *   **MARK I Kit:** Contains two separate autoinjectors: 2 mg Atropine and 600 mg 2-PAM Cl.
        *   **ATNAA (Antidote Treatment Nerve Agent Auto-Injector):** Single needle delivering both Atropine (2.1 mg) and Pralidoxime (600 mg). Every soldier carries 3 kits and one 10 mg Diazepam auto-injector.

#### 2. Vesicants (Blister Agents)
Agents that burn and blister the skin or any part of the body they contact.
*   **Mustard Gas (Yperite):**
    *   *Odor:* Garlic, mustard, or horseradish.
    *   *Features:* Delayed symptoms (4-24 hours). Erythema $\rightarrow$ Large thin-walled blisters. Eye damage (conjunctivitis to blindness). Bone marrow suppression (pancytopenia).
*   **Lewisite:**
    *   *Odor:* Geraniums.
    *   *Features:* Contains [[Arsenic]]. Immediate pain and blistering. Systemic arsenic toxicity.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Decontamination:** Fullers earth, 0.5% hypochlorite solution.
    *   **Antidote:** No specific antidote for Mustard gas (symptomatic treatment). **[[BAL]] (Dimercaprol)** is the specific antidote for Lewisite.

#### 3. Blood Agents (Cyanides)
*   **Agents:** Hydrogen Cyanide (HCN), Cyanogen Chloride.
*   **Features:** Histotoxic anoxia. Rapid death. Odor of bitter almonds. Cherry-red discoloration of skin/blood.
*   **Management:** Amyl nitrite (inhalation) + Sodium Nitrite (IV) + Sodium Thiosulfate (IV). Hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit) is an alternative.

#### 4. Pulmonary/Choking Agents
*   **Agents:** [[Phosgene]] (smells like new-mown hay), Chlorine.
*   **Pathology:** Damages the alveolar-capillary membrane $\rightarrow$ Fluid leakage $\rightarrow$ Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
*   **Clinical:** Latent period (hours) followed by dyspnea, frothy sputum, and cyanosis.
*   **Management:** Rest, oxygen, steroids, assisted ventilation (PEEP).

### Medicolegal Aspects

1.  **International Law:** The use of CWAs is prohibited under the **Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)** and the **Geneva Protocol**.
2.  **Terrorism:** Medical officers must be aware of mass casualty management involving these agents (e.g., Tokyo subway [[Sarin]] attack).
3.  **Homicide:** Rare, but agents like cyanide or succinylcholine (neuromuscular blocker) have been used.
4.  **Autopsy Precautions:**
    *   Bodies contaminated with CWAs pose a risk to the pathologist (secondary contamination).
    *   PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) is mandatory.
    *   Decontamination of the body is required before autopsy.

### Autopsy Findings

*   **Nerve Agents:** Congestion of viscera, pulmonary edema, constricted pupils (may persist post-mortem).
*   **Blister Agents:** Chemical burns, ulceration of skin/eyes/respiratory tract, necrosis of tracheal mucosa.
*   **Blood Agents:** Bright red hypostasis (Cyanide), smell of bitter almonds.
*   **Choking Agents:** Massive, heavy, edematous lungs ("Marble-like"), froth in airways.
