### Branchial Apparatus (Pharyngeal Apparatus)

The [[branchial apparatus]] (also known as the pharyngeal apparatus) develops during the 4th and 5th weeks of intrauterine life. It consists of bars of mesenchymal tissue (arches) separated by deep clefts externally and pouches internally.

#### Structure of the Branchial Apparatus
The apparatus is composed of three main components:
1.  **Pharyngeal Arches:** Mesodermal thickenings containing a cartilage bar, a muscle group, an artery, and a specific cranial nerve.
2.  **Pharyngeal Clefts (Grooves):** Ectodermal linings on the outer aspect separating the arches.
3.  **Pharyngeal Pouches:** Endodermal linings on the inner aspect.

### Pharyngeal Arches
Each arch has specific derivatives that form the structures of the head and neck.

| Arch | Cranial Nerve (Post-trematic) | Skeletal Derivatives | Muscular Derivatives |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1st (Mandibular)** | [[Trigeminal nerve]] (V) (Mandibular division) | • [[Malleus]] & [[Incus]]<br>• [[Meckel's cartilage]]<br>• Mandible, Maxilla, Premaxilla<br>• Sphenomandibular ligament | • Muscles of Mastication (Masseter, Temporalis, Pterygoids)<br>• [[Tensor tympani]]<br>• [[Tensor veli palatini]]<br>• Anterior belly of digastric, Mylohyoid |
| **2nd (Hyoid)** | [[Facial nerve]] (VII) | • [[Stapes]] superstructure<br>• [[Reichert's cartilage]]<br>• Styloid process<br>• Lesser cornu & upper body of Hyoid<br>• Stylohyoid ligament | • Muscles of facial expression<br>• [[Stapedius]]<br>• Stylohyoid<br>• Posterior belly of digastric |
| **3rd** | [[Glossopharyngeal nerve]] (IX) | • Greater cornu & lower body of Hyoid | • [[Stylopharyngeus]] |
| **4th** | [[Vagus nerve]] (X) (Superior Laryngeal Branch) | • [[Thyroid cartilage]] (upper part)<br>• [[Epiglottis]] (from hypobranchial eminence of 3rd/4th arch) | • [[Cricothyroid]]<br>• Pharyngeal constrictors<br>• Levator palatini |
| **6th** | [[Vagus nerve]] (X) (Recurrent Laryngeal Branch) | • [[Cricoid cartilage]]<br>• [[Arytenoid cartilage]]<br>• Corniculate & Cuneiform cartilages | • Intrinsic muscles of larynx (except cricothyroid) |

**Note on Nerves:**
*   **Post-trematic nerve:** The main nerve of the arch.
*   **Pre-trematic nerve:** A nerve from the arch below supplying the endodermal surface of the arch above (e.g., [[Chorda tympani]] is the pre-trematic nerve of the 1st arch, derived from the Facial nerve of the 2nd arch).

### Pharyngeal Pouches (Endodermal Derivatives)
The pouches develop on the inside of the pharynx.

*   **1st Pouch:**
    *   Forms the [[tubotympanic recess]].
    *   Derivatives: [[Eustachian tube]], [[Middle ear]] cavity, and [[Mastoid antrum]].
*   **2nd Pouch:**
    *   Forms the [[Palatine tonsil]].
    *   Partially contributes to the Eustachian tube.
    *   **Crypta magna** (intratonsillar cleft) is a remnant of the 2nd pouch.
*   **3rd Pouch:**
    *   **Dorsal wing:** Inferior [[Parathyroid gland]].
    *   **Ventral wing:** [[Thymus gland]].
*   **4th Pouch:**
    *   **Dorsal wing:** Superior [[Parathyroid gland]].
*   **5th Pouch:**
    *   Forms the **Ultimobranchial body**, which gives rise to Parafollicular 'C' cells of the thyroid (producing calcitonin).

### Pharyngeal Clefts (Ectodermal Derivatives)
*   **1st Cleft:**
    *   Develops into the [[External Auditory Canal]] (EAC).
    *   The closing plate between the 1st cleft and 1st pouch forms the **Tympanic Membrane** (comprising all three germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm).
*   **2nd, 3rd, and 4th Clefts:**
    *   Typically fused to form a temporary cavity called the **Cervical Sinus** (Sinus of His), which usually obliterates.
    *   Persistence leads to branchial cysts or fistulas.

---

### Development of the Pinna
*   The [[Pinna]] develops around the 1st branchial cleft from six mesenchymal thickenings known as the **Hillocks of His**.
*   **1st Arch:** Forms the [[Tragus]] (Hillock 1).
*   **2nd Arch:** Forms the rest of the pinna (Helix, Antihelix, Antitragus, Lobule).

### Clinical Implications and Anomalies

**1. Branchial Cysts and Fistulas**
*   **Branchial Cyst:** Formed when the cervical sinus (2nd, 3rd, 4th clefts) fails to obliterate. Commonly presents as a smooth, fluctuant swelling in the upper neck, anterior to the [[sternocleidomastoid muscle]].
*   **First Branchial Cleft Anomalies:** Present as cysts or sinuses near the ear lobule or angle of the mandible; tracts may run towards the EAC.
*   **Second Branchial Fistula:** The tract runs between the external and internal carotid arteries and opens into the tonsillar fossa.

**2. First Arch Syndromes**
*   **Treacher Collins Syndrome (Mandibulofacial Dysostosis):** Malformed ossicles, hypoplasia of mandible/malar bones, and coloboma of lower lids.
*   **Pierre Robin Sequence:** Triad of micrognathia, glossoptosis, and cleft palate.

**3. DiGeorge Sequence**
*   Failure of the 3rd and 4th pouches to differentiate.
*   Features: Immunological problems (Thymus aplasia), Hypocalcemia (Parathyroid aplasia), and cardiovascular defects.

**4. Preauricular Sinus**
*   Result of faulty fusion of the Hillocks of His (auricular tubercles).
*   Commonly located between the tragus and the crus of the helix.

**5. Ossicular Anomalies**
*   Since the malleus and incus are 1st arch derivatives and the stapes is a 2nd arch derivative, anomalies often affect them separately.
*   **Stapes fixation:** The footplate is derived from the otic capsule (labyrinth), not the 2nd arch, which explains why stapes fixation can occur independently of stapes superstructure abnormalities.
