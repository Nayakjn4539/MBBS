# Scapula Fractures

### Overview and Anatomy
The [[Scapula]] is a flat bone encased in a thick envelope of muscles. This anatomical characteristic has two major clinical implications:
1.  **Stability:** The muscular attachments prevent significant displacement of fracture fragments in the majority of cases.
2.  **Healing:** The rich vascular supply from the surrounding muscles ensures that fractures usually unite well.

Because the scapula is protected by the rib cage and heavy musculature, considerable force is required to fracture it. Therefore, the presence of a scapula fracture serves as a marker for **high-energy trauma** and potential associated life-threatening injuries.

### Mechanism of Injury
*   **Direct Trauma (Most Common):**
    *   High-energy direct blow to the back of the shoulder.
    *   Examples: Road traffic accidents, falls from a height, or being struck by a heavy object.
*   **Indirect Force:**
    *   **Axial loading:** Force transmitted through the [[Glenohumeral joint]], leading to glenoid fractures.
    *   **Muscle Avulsion:** Sudden violent muscle contraction causing fractures of the [[Coracoid process]] or [[Acromion]].
*   **Shoulder Dislocation:** Can cause fractures of the glenoid rim (e.g., [[Bankart lesion]]).

### Classification based on Anatomical Site
Fractures can occur at four main sites. Most often, the fracture is undisplaced due to the splinting action of surrounding muscles.

1.  **Body of Scapula:** The most common site. Often comminuted.
2.  **Neck of Scapula:** Can be impacted or displaced.
3.  **Processes:**
    *   [[Acromion process]]
    *   [[Coracoid process]]
4.  **[[Glenoid Cavity]] (Articular):** Intra-articular fractures which may lead to joint instability or arthritis.

### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Severe pain in the shoulder region.
    *   Inability to move the shoulder.
    *   Pain upon deep breathing (suggests associated thoracic injury).
*   **Signs:**
    *   The patient typically holds the arm adducted to the side.
    *   **Swelling and Bruising:** Extensive ecchymosis over the scapular region and chest wall.
    *   **Tenderness:** Localized over the fracture site.
    *   **Deformity:** Rarely visible due to muscle cover, unless there is a fracture of the acromion.

### Associated Injuries
Due to the high energy required to fracture the scapula, associated injuries are common (35–98%) and often more life-threatening than the fracture itself.

*   **Thoracic:** [[Rib fractures]], [[Pneumothorax]], [[Hemothorax]], pulmonary contusion.
*   **Skeletal:** [[Clavicle fracture]] (Ipsilateral), spine fractures.
*   **Neurological:** [[Brachial plexus injury]], suprascapular nerve injury.
*   **Vascular:** Subclavian artery injury (rare but serious).

**Clinical Implication:** Always examine the chest and neurovascular status. If breathing is painful, thoracic injury must be strictly excluded.

### Imaging
*   **X-rays:**
    *   **True AP View (Grashey view):** Shows the glenohumeral joint space.
    *   **Scapular Y View (Lateral):** Useful for scapular body and spine fractures.
    *   **Axillary View:** Essential for assessing the glenoid and exclusion of dislocation.
*   **CT Scan:**
    *   Indicated for **[[Glenoid fractures]]** to assess the articular step-off and comminution.
    *   Useful for pre-operative planning in complex fractures.

### Management

#### Non-Operative Treatment
The vast majority of scapula fractures (especially body and spine) are treated conservatively.
*   **Indications:** Undisplaced or minimally displaced fractures.
*   **Method:**
    *   **Immobilization:** Triangular sling or shoulder immobilizer for comfort (usually 2–4 weeks).
    *   **Analgesia:** Adequate pain control.
    *   **Rehabilitation:** Early active exercises (pendulum exercises) for the shoulder, elbow, and fingers as soon as pain subsides (usually within 1 week) to prevent stiffness.

#### Operative Treatment
Surgery is relatively rare but indicated for specific unstable patterns.
*   **Indications:**
    *   **Displaced Glenoid Fractures:** Intra-articular step-off (gap > 2-4 mm) leading to joint incongruity.
    *   **Unstable Neck Fractures:** Severe angular deformity or translational displacement.
    *   **"Floating Shoulder":** Ipsilateral fracture of the **[[Clavicle]]** and **[[Scapula neck]]** causing suspension instability of the upper limb.
    *   **Process Fractures:** Displaced acromion fractures impinging on the rotator cuff.
*   **Technique:**
    *   Open Reduction and Internal Fixation ([[ORIF]]) using reconstruction plates and screws.

### Complications
*   **Malunion:** Common but usually well-tolerated. Can result in scapulothoracic dyskinesia or crepitus.
*   **Stiffness:** Frozen shoulder due to prolonged immobilization.
*   **Post-traumatic Arthritis:** Specifically in malunited glenoid fractures.
*   **Neurological Deficit:** Suprascapular nerve entrapment in the fracture callus or suprascapular notch.

### Summary Table: Scapula Fracture Management

| Fracture Type | Treatment Modality | Key considerations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Body of Scapula** | Conservative (Sling) | Most common; heals well due to vascularity. |
| **Undisplaced Neck** | Conservative | Early mobilization to prevent stiffness. |
| **Displaced Glenoid** | Operative (ORIF) | Requires CT scan; aim is to restore joint surface. |
| **Floating Shoulder** | Operative | Fixation of clavicle and/or scapula neck. |
