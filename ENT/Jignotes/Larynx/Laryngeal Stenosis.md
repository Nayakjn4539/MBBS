# [[Larynx]] > Laryngeal Stenosis

### Laryngeal Stenosis

**Laryngeal Stenosis** refers to the narrowing of the airway at the level of the larynx, which can occur at the supraglottic, glottic, or subglottic levels. It leads to varying degrees of respiratory obstruction and voice changes.

---

### Classification and Etiology

Laryngeal stenosis is broadly classified into **Congenital** and **Acquired** types.

#### 1. Congenital Laryngeal Stenosis
*   **Pathology:** Result of failure of the epithelial primordium to split in the sagittal plane or incomplete recanalization of the laryngotracheal groove.
*   **[[Congenital Subglottic Stenosis]] (SGS):**
    *   Defined as a subglottic diameter of **< 4.0 mm** in a full-term neonate or **< 3.0 mm** in a premature neonate.
    *   It is the **third most common** congenital laryngeal anomaly.
    *   **Types:**
        *   Membranous (submucosal thickening).
        *   Cartilaginous (abnormal shape or small dimension of the [[cricoid cartilage]]).
*   **[[Laryngeal Web]]:**
    *   Incomplete recanalization, usually located anteriorly at the glottic level.
    *   Can cause weak cry, aphonia, or stridor.

#### 2. Acquired Laryngeal Stenosis
This is more common than congenital stenosis.
*   **Trauma (Most Common):**
    *   **[[Endotracheal Intubation]]:** Prolonged intubation is the leading cause of acquired [[subglottic stenosis]] due to pressure necrosis from the tube cuff, leading to granulation and fibrosis.
    *   **External Trauma:** Blunt or penetrating injuries to the neck (e.g., strangulation, fractures).
    *   **Surgical Trauma:** High tracheostomy, cricothyroidotomy, or previous laryngeal surgery.
    *   **Chemical/Thermal:** Inhalation burns or caustic ingestion.
*   **Chronic Infections (Granulomatous):**
    *   [[Tuberculosis]]: Can cause fibrosis and stenosis.
    *   **Scleroma ([[Rhinoscleroma]]):** Caused by *Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis*. Typically affects the subglottis causing smooth, red swelling and woody infiltration.
    *   **Leprosy:** Cicatrization leads to stenosis.
    *   **Syphilis:** Gummatous ulceration heals by scarring and stenosis.
    *   **Diphtheria:** Membrane formation and scarring.
*   **Systemic/Autoimmune:**
    *   **[[Wegener's Granulomatosis]] (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis):** Causes laryngotracheal stenosis and subglottic narrowing.
    *   **Sarcoidosis**.
*   **Neoplasms:**
    *   Chondroma, carcinoma, or hemangiomas obstructing the lumen.
*   **Radiation:** Post-radiotherapy fibrosis.

### Clinical Features

Symptoms depend on the severity and site of stenosis.

*   **[[Stridor]]:**
    *   **Biphasic Stridor:** Characteristic of **glottic** or **subglottic** stenosis (fixed narrowing at the cricoid ring).
    *   **Inspiratory Stridor:** Seen in supraglottic or glottic obstruction.
    *   **Expiratory Stridor:** Tracheal/bronchial obstruction.
*   **Respiratory Distress:** Dyspnea, tachypnea, suprasternal/intercostal recession.
*   **Voice Changes:**
    *   **Hoarseness/Dysphonia:** If vocal cords are involved (glottic stenosis).
    *   **Weak Cry/Aphonia:** Seen in congenital laryngeal webs.
*   **Recurrent Croup:** Children with mild subglottic stenosis often present with recurrent episodes of "croup" that are slow to resolve.
*   **Failure to Thrive/Feeding Difficulties:** In infants with significant airway compromise.
*   **Failure to Extubate:** In adults or neonates with acquired stenosis following intubation.

### Diagnosis and Assessment

1.  **History:** Onset (birth vs. later), history of intubation, trauma, or systemic disease.
2.  **Flexible Fiberoptic Laryngoscopy:** Assessment of supraglottis and vocal cord mobility. Limited view of subglottis.
3.  **[[Direct Laryngoscopy]] and Bronchoscopy:**
    *   **Gold Standard** for evaluation.
    *   Allows precise measurement of the subglottic diameter using endotracheal tubes (leak test).
    *   Essential to rule out synchronous airway lesions.
4.  **Radiology:**
    *   **X-ray Neck (AP/Lateral):** May show **"Steeple Sign"** (pencil-tip narrowing) in subglottic stenosis.
    *   **[[CT Scan]] (High Resolution):** Evaluates the length and thickness of the stenotic segment and cartilaginous framework.

#### Cotton-Myer Grading System
Used for grading **[[Subglottic Stenosis]]** based on the reduction of the cross-sectional area of the subglottis.

| Grade | Obstruction (%) | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Grade I** | 0 – 50% | Minor stenosis |
| **Grade II** | 51 – 70% | Moderate stenosis |
| **Grade III** | 71 – 99% | Severe stenosis (detectable lumen present) |
| **Grade IV** | 100% | No detectable lumen (Complete obstruction) |

### Management

Treatment depends on the grade of stenosis, etiology, and patient age.

#### 1. Medical Management
*   **Observation:** For Grade I stenosis with minimal symptoms.
*   **Anti-reflux Therapy:** To treat [[Laryngopharyngeal Reflux]] (LPR) which exacerbates stenosis and granulation.
*   **Steroids:** Systemic or intralesional injections to reduce inflammation/granulation.

#### 2. Endoscopic Management
Suitable for thin webs, granulation tissue, or early/soft stenosis (Grade I/II).
*   **[[CO2 Laser]] Excision:** Radial incisions are made to release the stenosis.
*   **Balloon Dilatation:** Dilates the airway; useful for immature/soft stenosis.
*   **[[Mitomycin C]]:** Topical application (anti-fibroblastic agent) to prevent re-stenosis and scarring after dilation or lysis.
*   **Microdebrider:** Removal of granulation tissue.

#### 3. Surgical Management (Open Procedures)
Indicated for severe stenosis (Grade III/IV), cartilaginous involvement, or failed endoscopic treatment.
*   **Anterior Cricoid Split:** Division of the cricoid cartilage anteriorly to decompress the subglottis; often used in neonates to facilitate extubation.
*   **[[Laryngotracheal Reconstruction]] (LTR):**
    *   Expansion of the airway using cartilage grafts (usually **costal cartilage**).
    *   Can be **Anterior graft** (to widen diameter), **Posterior graft** (to distract posterior cricoid lamina), or both.
    *   May require stenting (e.g., Montgomery T-tube) or a temporary tracheostomy.
*   **[[Cricotracheal Resection]] (CTR):**
    *   Resection of the stenotic segment (cricoid arch and upper tracheal rings) with end-to-end anastomosis.
    *   Preferred for severe Grade III and Grade IV stenosis or adult subglottic stenosis.
*   **Laryngeal Keel:** A silastic sheet placed between vocal cords after dividing a [[Laryngeal Web]] to prevent re-adhesion (synechiae).

#### 4. Airway Maintenance
*   **[[Tracheostomy]]:** May be required to secure the airway in severe obstruction or bilateral vocal cord palsy before definitive surgery.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Intubation Risk:** Patients with stenosis are difficult to intubate. Smaller endotracheal tubes must be available.
*   **Prevention:** Use appropriate size ET tubes, monitor cuff pressures, and avoid prolonged intubation to prevent acquired stenosis.
*   **Differential Diagnosis:** Must differentiate from **[[Laryngomalacia]]** (supraglottic, inspiratory stridor, normal cry) and **[[Vocal Cord Palsy]]** (breathy cry/voice).
