# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Epidemiology of Poliomyelitis. Strategy of polio eradication in India and globally. Add a note on monovalent and bivalent polio vaccines

# Epidemiology of Poliomyelitis

Poliomyelitis is an acute viral infection involving the alimentary tract, which may affect the Central Nervous System (CNS) leading to flaccid paralysis.

### 1. Agent Factors
*   **Agent:** [[Poliovirus]], an RNA virus of the *Picornaviridae* family (Enterovirus genus).
*   **Serotypes:** Three serotypes exist: Type 1, 2, and 3.
    *   **Type 1:** Most common cause of epidemics and paralysis.
    *   **Type 2:** Most antigenic; Wild Poliovirus Type 2 (WPV2) was declared eradicated in 2015.
    *   **Type 3:** Least common but associated with [[Vaccine Associated Paralytic Poliomyelitis]] (VAPP).
*   **Survival:** The virus can survive in water for 4 months and feces for 6 months in cold environments. It is resistant to common disinfectants but killed by heat and pasteurization.

### 2. Reservoir and Source
*   **Reservoir:** **Man is the only known reservoir**. There are **no chronic carriers**,.
*   **Infective Material:** Feces and oropharyngeal secretions.
*   **Period of Communicability:**
    *   7 to 10 days before and after the onset of symptoms.
    *   Virus excreted in feces for 2–3 weeks (up to 3–4 months).

### 3. Host Factors
*   **Age:** Primarily a disease of infancy and childhood. In India, 50% of cases occurred in infancy; the most vulnerable age is **6 months to 3 years**,.
*   **Sex:** Males are affected more than females (Ratio 3:1).
*   **Immunity:** Maternal antibodies protect infants for the first 3–5 months. Post-infection immunity is type-specific and lifelong.
*   **Risk Factors (Provocative Factors):** Factors precipitating paralytic polio in infected individuals:
    *   **F**atigue
    *   **I**ntramuscular injections (e.g., Alum-containing DPT) during incubation
    *   **T**rauma (e.g., Tonsillectomy during epidemics),.

> **Mnemonic for Risk Factors: FIT** (Fatigue, Injections, Trauma).

### 4. Environmental Factors
*   **Season:** Peaks during the rainy season (June to September in India).
*   **Transmission:**
    *   **Fecal-Oral Route:** Main route in developing countries due to poor sanitation.
    *   **Droplet Infection:** Possible in the acute phase via throat secretions.

### 5. Clinical Spectrum (The Iceberg Phenomenon)
For every 1 clinical case, there are roughly **1000 subclinical cases** in children.

| Clinical Presentation | Frequency | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inapparent Infection** | 91–96% | Asymptomatic; recognized only by viral isolation/antibody rise. |
| **Minor Illness** (Abortive) | 4–8% | Mild fever, sore throat, vomiting; recovery is rapid. |
| **Non-Paralytic Polio** | 1% | Aseptic meningitis (stiff neck/back). |
| **Paralytic Polio** | < 1% | Asymmetrical [[flaccid paralysis]]; descending paralysis; no sensory loss. |

# Strategy for Polio Eradication

Polio is amenable to eradication because man is the only host, there are no chronic carriers, the virus survives poorly in the environment, and an effective vaccine exists.

### 1. Global Strategy (Polio Endgame Strategic Plan)
The strategy has shifted from control to eradication, aiming for a polio-free world.
*   **Phasing out [[OPV]]:** To eliminate risks of [[Vaccine Derived Poliovirus]] (VDPV) and VAPP.
*   **Introduction of [[IPV]]:** Inactivated Polio Vaccine was introduced into routine immunization globally by the end of 2015 to provide a baseline immunity against Type 2 virus before the withdrawal of tOPV.
*   **The Switch:** Synchronized global switch from Trivalent OPV (tOPV) to Bivalent OPV (bOPV) in April 2016 to remove the Type 2 component.
*   **Containment:** Strict containment of polioviruses in laboratories.

### 2. Strategy in India (Four Pillars)
India was certified **Polio-free on 27th March 2014**. To maintain this status, the following strategies are used:

**A. Pulse Polio Immunization ([[PPI]])**
*   **Concept:** Simultaneous mass administration of [[OPV]] to **all children 0–5 years** on a single day, regardless of previous immunization status.
*   **Goal:** To flood the community with vaccine virus, replacing the wild virus and breaking transmission.
*   **Components:**
    *   **NIDs (National Immunization Days):** Nationwide rounds (usually Dec/Jan).
    *   **SNIDs (Sub-National Immunization Days):** Focused on high-risk states (UP, Bihar, etc.).
    *   **Booth + House-to-House:** Vaccination at booths followed by house-to-house search for missed children (“X” marked houses).

**B. Strengthening Routine Immunization**
*   Ensuring high coverage of infants with the primary schedule (OPV, IPV/fIPV) to maintain herd immunity.
*   Introduction of **fractional IPV ([[fIPV]])** (0.1 ml ID) at 6 and 14 weeks to boost immunity.

**C. Surveillance of Acute Flaccid Paralysis ([[AFP]])**
*   **Definition:** Any child <15 years with sudden onset of flaccid paralysis, or any person with suspected polio.
*   **Protocol:**
    *   Immediate reporting.
    *   **Stool Sampling:** Two stool samples collected 24–48 hours apart within 14 days of onset.
    *   **Reverse Cold Chain:** Samples sent to accredited labs at 4°–8°C.
    *   **Follow-up:** Check for residual paralysis after 60 days.

**D. Mop-Up Immunization**
*   Door-to-door immunization in specific high-risk districts or areas where the virus is known or suspected to be circulating.
*   Often the final strategy to "mop up" remaining pockets of infection.

# Note on Monovalent and Bivalent Polio Vaccines

Historically, **Trivalent OPV (tOPV)** containing types 1, 2, and 3 was used. However, the Type 2 component in tOPV interfered with the immune response to Types 1 and 3 and was responsible for most cases of [[cVDPV]] (Circulating Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus).

### 1. Monovalent Oral Polio Vaccine (mOPV)
*   **Composition:** Contains live attenuated virus of **only one serotype** (Type 1 or Type 3).
*   **Advantage:** More potent per dose against the specific serotype compared to trivalent vaccine because there is no interference from other types.
*   **Use:** It was used strategically in high-risk areas (like UP and Bihar) to target specific wild virus outbreaks during the eradication phase.

### 2. Bivalent Oral Polio Vaccine (bOPV)
*   **Composition:** Contains live attenuated Poliovirus **Type 1 and Type 3**.
*   **Rationale:** Wild Poliovirus Type 2 has been eradicated (1999). Continued use of Type 2 in vaccines (tOPV) posed a risk of VAPP and VDPV.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **"The Switch":** In April 2016, India and the world switched from **tOPV to bOPV**.
    *   **Current Use:** It is now used in routine immunization and polio campaigns.
*   **Storage:** Stored at -20°C.
