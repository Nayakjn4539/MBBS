# Barton's Fracture

### Definition
[[Barton's Fracture]] is an **intra-articular fracture** of the [[distal radius]] associated with **subluxation or dislocation** of the [[radiocarpal joint]].
*   Unlike [[Colles' fracture]] or [[Smith's fracture]], which are primarily extra-articular, Barton's fracture always involves the articular surface and the rim of the radius.
*   It is essentially a **fracture-dislocation** of the [[wrist]].

### Classification
Based on the location of the fracture line and the direction of displacement, it is divided into two types:

#### 1. Volar Barton's Fracture (Anterior Type)
*   **Definition:** Fracture of the **volar (anterior) margin** of the distal radius with volar subluxation or dislocation of the [[carpus]].
*   **Incidence:** More common than the dorsal type.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   Usually results from a fall on the outstretched hand with the wrist in **volar flexion**.
    *   Caused by **palmar tensile stress** and **dorsal shear stress**.
    *   Often combined with a [[radial styloid fracture]].

#### 2. Dorsal Barton's Fracture (Posterior Type)
*   **Definition:** Fracture of the **dorsal (posterior) margin** of the distal radius with dorsal subluxation of the carpus.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   Fall on an outstretched hand with the wrist in **extension** and **pronation**.
    *   Similar mechanism to [[Colles' fracture]] but the fracture line extends into the joint, shearing off the dorsal lip.

### Clinical Features
*   **Pain and Swelling:** Localized to the wrist.
*   **Deformity:** Visible deformity may be present due to the subluxation of the carpal bones.
*   **Functional Loss:**
    *   **Volar Barton:** Palmar flexion is grossly restricted and painful.
    *   Total loss of wrist movements is common in acute presentation.
*   **Tenderness:** Point tenderness over the anterior or posterior aspect of the distal radius depending on the type.

**Clinical Implication:**
This injury is often unstable. A simple cast is usually insufficient because the strong pull of the [[flexor tendons]] (in Volar Barton) or [[extensor tendons]] (in Dorsal Barton) tends to redisplace the fracture.

---

### Diagnosis and Imaging
*   **X-ray (True AP and Lateral Views):**
    *   **Lateral View:** The most diagnostic view. It reveals the oblique fracture line running from the articular surface to the cortex.
    *   Shows the subluxation of the [[carpus]] along with the fractured fragment.
*   **CT Scan:**
    *   Useful for evaluating the extent of articular involvement and comminution (complex fractures).
    *   Helps in surgical planning.

### Management
The primary goal is **anatomical reduction** and restoration of joint congruity to prevent secondary [[osteoarthritis]].

#### 1. Conservative Treatment
*   **Indication:** Rarely indicated because these fractures are inherently **unstable**. Only considered if the fracture is undisplaced or the patient is medically unfit for surgery.
*   **Method:** Closed reduction and immobilization in a long arm cast.
    *   **Volar Barton:** Wrist immobilized in slight flexion.
    *   **Dorsal Barton:** Wrist immobilized in slight extension.
*   **Risk:** High rate of redisplacement and subluxation.

#### 2. Surgical Treatment (Gold Standard)
Since these are intra-articular and unstable fractures, **Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF)** is the preferred treatment.

**A. Volar Barton's Fracture**
*   **Approach:** Volar approach (Henry’s approach).
*   **Fixation:** **Buttress Plate** (e.g., **Ellis T-plate** or [[Locking Compression Plate]]).
    *   The plate is applied to the volar surface of the radius.
    *   It acts as a buttress to prevent the volar fragment from slipping forward.

**B. Dorsal Barton's Fracture**
*   **Approach:** Dorsal approach.
*   **Fixation:**
    *   **Buttress Plate:** Small T-plate or L-plate applied dorsally.
    *   **K-wires:** May be used if the fragment is small, often supplemented with a cast.
    *   However, dorsal plating can irritate extensor tendons; therefore, low-profile plates are used, or the hardware may need removal later.

### Comparison of Wrist Fractures

| Feature | [[Colles' Fracture]] | [[Smith's Fracture]] | [[Barton's Fracture]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Site** | Cortico-cancellous junction (Extra-articular) | Cortico-cancellous junction (Extra-articular) | Intra-articular (Rim fracture) |
| **Displacement of Distal Fragment** | **Dorsal** tilt/shift | **Volar** tilt/shift | **Dorsal** or **Volar** subluxation with the carpus |
| **Joint Involvement** | Usually No | Usually No | **Yes (Always)** |
| **Stability** | Relatively Stable | Unstable | **Highly Unstable** |
| **Treatment of Choice** | Closed Reduction + Cast | Closed Reduction + Cast (or ORIF) | **ORIF (Buttress Plate)** |

---

### Complications
1.  **Secondary Osteoarthritis:** Due to incongruity of the articular surface.
2.  **Wrist Stiffness:** Common due to intra-articular damage and immobilization.
3.  **Carpal Instability:** If ligaments are damaged or reduction is imperfect.
4.  **Median Nerve Compression:** Acute [[Carpal Tunnel Syndrome]] (especially in Volar Barton).
5.  **Malunion:** Leading to restricted range of motion and pain.
