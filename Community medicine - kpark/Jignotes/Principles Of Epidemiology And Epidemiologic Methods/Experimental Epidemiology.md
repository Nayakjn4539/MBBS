# Experimental Epidemiology

Experimental epidemiology, often equated with **Intervention Studies**, involves the active manipulation of a variable (disease determinant) by the investigator to observe the effect on a specific outcome. Unlike [[Observational Studies]] where nature takes its course, here the investigator controls the conditions.

It is considered the **Gold Standard** for establishing cause-and-effect relationships and evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic or preventive measures,.

### **Aims of Experimental Epidemiology**,
1.  To provide scientific proof of aetiological (risk) factors.
2.  To measure the **effectiveness** and **efficiency** of health services/interventions.
3.  To evaluate new drugs, vaccines, or therapeutic procedures.

### **Classification of Experimental Studies**,

1.  **Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs):** (Clinical Trials) - *Unit of study is Patient.*
2.  **Field Trials:** (Preventive Trials) - *Unit of study is Healthy People.*
3.  **Community Trials:** (Community Intervention Studies) - *Unit of study is Entire Community.*

### **1. Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)**

An epidemiological experiment where subjects in a population are **randomly allocated** into groups, usually called "Study" and "Control" groups, to receive or not receive an experimental procedure,.

#### **Basic Steps of RCT**,
> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Flowchart showing the steps of RCT: Protocol -> Selection -> Randomization -> Manipulation -> Follow-up -> Assessment

*Mnemonic: **P**lease **S**elect **R**andom **M**en **F**or **A**ssessment*

1.  **Drawing up a [[Protocol]]:** Specifies aims, sample size, criteria, and procedures. Essential for standardization.
2.  **Selecting Reference and Experimental Populations:**
    *   **Reference Population:** The target population to which results will be generalized.
    *   **Experimental Population:** The actual study subjects derived from the reference population. Must give **Informed Consent**.
3.  **[[Randomization]]:** The **Heart of the Control Trial**,.
    *   Allocates participants to Study or Control groups.
    *   Ensures every individual has an **equal and known chance** of being in either group.
    *   **Purpose:** Eliminates **[[Selection Bias]]** and ensures **Comparability** (makes groups similar in known and unknown prognostic factors).
4.  **Manipulation (Intervention):** Deliberate application, withdrawal, or reduction of the suspected causal factor (drug/vaccine) in the experimental group.
5.  **Follow-up:** Examination of both groups at defined intervals. Addresses **Attrition** (loss to follow-up).
6.  **Assessment:** evaluation of the outcome in terms of:
    *   *Positive results:* e.g., Recovery.
    *   *Negative results:* e.g., Death, side effects.

#### **Bias and Blinding in RCT**
To reduce **[[Observer Bias]]** and **Subject Bias**, blinding is used,.

| Type of Blinding | Who is Blinded? | Bias Removed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Single Blind** | Patient | Subject Bias |
| **Double Blind** | Patient + Doctor (Investigator) | Subject + Investigator Bias |
| **Triple Blind** | Patient + Doctor + Analyzer | Subject + Investigator + Analyzer Bias |

*(Note: Double Blinding is the most frequently used method)*.

### **2. Phases of Clinical Trials**-,,

Clinical trials are a type of RCT used to evaluate new drugs.

| Phase | Subjects | Purpose | Key Feature |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase I** | Healthy Volunteers (20-80) | Safety & Dosage | "First in Man", Max tolerated dose |
| **Phase II** | Patients (100-300) | **Efficacy** & Safety | Biological activity, preliminary efficacy |
| **Phase III** | Patients (Large groups) | **Comparison** (Effectiveness) | **RCT** against Standard of Care/Placebo. Gold Standard. |
| **Phase IV** | Patients (Post-marketing) | Long-term Safety | **Post-marketing Surveillance**, Rare side effects |

---

### **3. Field Trials**,
*   **Subjects:** **Healthy people** (not patients) who are presumably at risk.
*   **Purpose:** To prevent disease (Primary Prevention).
*   **Example:** Testing a new **[[Vaccine]]** (e.g., Salk vaccine trial for Polio).
*   **Logistics:** Requires a huge number of subjects and is expensive compared to clinical trials.

---

### **4. Community Trials**,
*   **Unit of Study:** **Entire Communities** (villages, districts) rather than individuals.
*   **Method:** The intervention is applied to the whole community.
*   **Example:** Fluoridation of water supply to prevent dental caries; lodization of salt for Goitre control.

### **Non-Randomized Trials**
Used when randomization is unethical or impossible.

1.  **Uncontrolled Trials:** No comparison group. Experience of earlier untreated patients (Historical Controls) is used.
2.  **Natural Experiments:** Nature causes the separation of groups (e.g., John Snow’s study of Cholera where different water companies supplied different houses).
3.  **Before and After Comparison Studies:** Comparing incidence of disease before and after a preventive measure (e.g., Seat belt legislation).

---

### **Study Designs in Experimental Epidemiology**,

1.  **Concurrent Parallel Design:** Comparisons made between two randomly assigned groups (Exposed vs Non-Exposed) running simultaneously.
2.  **Cross-over Design:** The study group receives treatment, then after a **washout period**, groups are switched (Control becomes Study and vice versa). *Removes ethical concern of denying treatment*,.
3.  **Factorial Design:** Evaluates two interventions simultaneously.

---

### **Clinical Relevance**
*   **Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM):** RCTs and Meta-analyses of RCTs provide the highest level of evidence for clinical decision-making.
*   **Drug Approval:** No new drug can be launched in the market without passing Phase III Clinical Trials.
*   **[[Intention to treat analysis]]:** A method in RCT analysis where subjects are analyzed according to the group they were originally assigned, regardless of whether they completed the treatment. This preserves randomization.
