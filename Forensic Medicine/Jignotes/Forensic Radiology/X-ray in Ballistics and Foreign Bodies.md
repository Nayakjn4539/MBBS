# [[Forensic Radiology]] > X-ray in Ballistics and Foreign Bodies

### Forensic Radiology: X-ray in Ballistics and Foreign Bodies

Radiological examination is a mandatory prerequisite before conducting an autopsy in cases involving firearms, explosions, and suspected internal concealment of foreign bodies. It serves as a non-invasive guide for the autopsy surgeon.

### 1. X-ray in Forensic Ballistics (Gunshot Injuries)

Routine [[Roentgenography]] (X-ray) of the whole body should be performed **before** removing clothes or cleaning the body to prevent loss of trace evidence.

#### A. Objectives of X-ray in Ballistics
1.  **Location of the Missile:** To locate the bullet, pellets, or slugs to facilitate easy retrieval during autopsy. This avoids unnecessary mutilation of the body during a "wild goose chase" for the projectile.
2.  **Track Visualization:** To visualize the path of the bullet. As a bullet passes through bone or tissue, it may leave a trail of minute metal fragments (lead shower) indicating the direction of travel.
3.  **Counting Projectiles:** To count the number of bullets or pellets present, which helps in determining the number of shots fired.
4.  **Identifying Ammunition:** To identify the nature of the ammunition (e.g., jacketed vs. non-jacketed, shotgun pellets vs. rifled slugs).
5.  **Differentiation of Wounds:** Helpful in distinguishing entrance from exit wounds based on the pattern of bone beveling (internal beveling for entry, external beveling for exit).
6.  **Old vs. New:** To distinguish between a recent bullet and an old retained bullet ([[Souvenir bullet]]) from a previous injury (encapsulated by fibrous tissue).

#### B. Specific Radiological Findings
*   **Lead Snowstorm Appearance:** Seen in high-velocity missile injuries or semi-jacketed bullets. It appears as a spray of minute, dust-like radio-opaque particles along the wound track due to fragmentation of the lead core.
*   **Deformation:** X-rays reveal if the bullet has mushroomed, fragmented, or ricocheted (flattened).
*   **Bullet Embolism:** Occasionally, a bullet may enter a large vessel and travel to a distant site (e.g., from the chest to the femoral artery). X-ray helps locate these elusive projectiles.
*   **Shotgun Dispersion:** In shotgun injuries, the spread (dispersion) of pellets on the X-ray can help estimate the **range of fire**.

### 2. X-ray in Body Packers and Stuffers (Intracorporeal Bodies)

**[[Body Packers]]** (mules) swallow drugs wrapped in condoms, balloons, or plastic to smuggle them across borders. **Body Stuffers** swallow drugs hastily to avoid arrest.

#### Radiological Signs of Drug Packets
Plain abdominal X-rays (supine and upright) are the first line of investigation.

| Sign | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tic-Tac Sign** | Oval or oblong densities resembling Tic-Tac candies. |
| **Double Condom Sign** | A radiolucent (dark) ring of air trapped between multiple layers of wrapping material (e.g., condoms). |
| **Halo Sign** | A complete rim of air/gas around the packet. |
| **Rosette Sign** | Air trapped in the knot of the condom/balloon, appearing like a rosette. |
| **Parallelism** | Packets aligning parallel to each other in the bowel loops. |

**Mnemonic for Body Packer Signs:** **"Tic-Tac D H R"**
*   **T**ic-Tac Sign
*   **D**ouble Condom Sign
*   **H**alo Sign
*   **R**osette Sign

### 3. General Foreign Bodies

X-rays are crucial for detecting radio-opaque foreign bodies involved in civil or criminal trauma.

*   **Sharp Force Trauma:** Detection of broken tips of knives (blade fragments) embedded in bone or deep tissue. This is vital to match the broken tip with the weapon recovered from the accused.
*   **Explosions/Blast Injuries:** Localization of shrapnel, metallic fragments, wire, or components of the bomb device (detonator parts).
*   **Iatrogenic Foreign Bodies:** Detection of [[Textiloma]] (retained surgical sponges/gossypiboma) or surgical instruments (forceps, scissors) left inside the body cavity during surgery. Surgical sponges usually have a radio-opaque marker thread.
*   **Torture:** Detection of needles or pins inserted into the body (e.g., under fingernails or in private parts).

### Medicolegal Aspects

1.  **Chain of Custody:** Any foreign body (bullet, packet, blade tip) located via X-ray and recovered during surgery or autopsy must be preserved, sealed, and handed over to the police with a strict chain of custody.
2.  **Documentation:** The X-ray films are legal documents. They must be labeled with the patient's name, date, and side (Left/Right) markings.
3.  **Preservation:** In cases of body packers, if a packet ruptures (Body Packer Syndrome), it can lead to fatal acute poisoning (e.g., cocaine/heroin). The X-ray serves as proof of the cause of death (ruptured packet).
4.  **Negligence:** Failure to X-ray a gunshot victim or a stab victim (suspected broken blade) before autopsy or surgery can be considered professional negligence if the foreign body is missed.

### Autopsy Findings Correlation

*   **Artifacts:** X-rays help distinguish [[Artefacts]] from true pathology. For example, distinguishing between a true fracture and a suture line, or identifying *Bone Pearls* (wax drippings) caused by high-voltage electrical burns which appear as round densities in bone.
*   **Identification:** Comparison of antemortem and postmortem X-rays (of frontal sinuses, old fractures, or implants) is a definitive method of identification.
