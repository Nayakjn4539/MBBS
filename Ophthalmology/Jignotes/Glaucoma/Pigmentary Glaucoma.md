# [[Glaucoma]] > Pigmentary Glaucoma

# **Pigmentary Glaucoma**

**Pigmentary Glaucoma** is a type of [[Secondary Open Angle Glaucoma]] caused by the dispersion of pigment granules from the iris pigment epithelium and their subsequent deposition in the anterior segment structures, primarily clogging the [[Trabecular Meshwork]],,.

It is closely associated with **Pigment Dispersion Syndrome (PDS)**. Approximately 1/3 to 50% of patients with PDS develop pigmentary glaucoma,,.

### **Epidemiology and Risk Factors**
*   **Demographics:** Classically affects **Young, Male, Myopes**,.
*   **Refractive Error:** [[Myopia]] is a strong risk factor,.
*   **Anatomy:** Associated with a deep [[Anterior Chamber]] and a concave iris configuration.

### **Pathogenesis**
The primary mechanism is mechanical friction resulting in pigment liberation:
1.  **Anatomical Predisposition:** The mid-peripheral iris bows posteriorly (concave configuration).
2.  **Mechanical Rubbing:** This backward bowing causes the posterior surface of the [[Iris]] (pigment epithelial layer) to rub against the [[Lens Zonules]] (suspensory ligaments) during pupil movement,,.
3.  **Pigment Dispersion:** Melanin granules are liberated into the aqueous humor.
4.  **Trabecular Obstruction:** These granules deposit in the [[Trabecular Meshwork]], causing physical obstruction and subsequent damage to the trabecular endothelial cells, leading to elevated [[Intraocular Pressure]] (IOP),.

### **Clinical Features and Signs**
The clinical presentation is characterized by a specific triad of signs affecting the cornea, iris, and angle.

#### **1. Corneal Signs**
*   **[[Krukenberg Spindle]]:** A vertical, spindle-shaped deposition of pigment on the [[Corneal Endothelium]],,.
    *   **Mechanism:** Convection currents in the anterior chamber deposit pigment centrally and inferiorly.
    *   It is a vertical spindle of pigment visible on slit-lamp biomicroscopy.

#### **2. Iris Signs**
*   **[[Iris Transillumination Defects]]:** Radial, slit-like defects in the mid-peripheral iris,.
    *   **Detection:** Best seen by retroillumination (shining light through the pupil and observing the red reflex through the iris).
    *   **Pathognomonic:** These radial defects correspond to the packets of zonules rubbing the iris and are considered pathognomonic.
*   **Pigment Deposition:** Pigment may be seen on the anterior iris surface.

#### **3. Angle Findings (Gonioscopy)**
*   **Wide Open Angle:** The angle is typically wide open.
*   **Hyperpigmentation:** The [[Trabecular Meshwork]] is heavily pigmented (homogeneously black/dark brown).
*   **[[Sampaolesi Line]]:** A wavy line of pigment deposited anterior to [[Schwalbe's Line]],,,.

#### **4. Lens and Zonular Signs**
*   **[[Zentmayer’s Line]] (Scheie's Line):** Pigment deposition on the lens zonules or along the insertion of zonules on the posterior lens capsule.
*   **Frock's Sign:** Whitish deposits or pigment may be seen, but distinct "frocks" are more characteristic of [[Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome]].

#### **Comparison of Pigmentary vs. Pseudoexfoliation Glaucoma**

| Feature | **[[Pigmentary Glaucoma]]** | **[[Pseudoexfoliation Glaucoma]]** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Typical Patient** | Young, Male, Myope | Elderly |
| **Mechanism** | Mechanical rubbing (Iris vs Zonules) | Systemic basement membrane disorder (Exfoliative material) |
| **Cornea** | Krukenberg Spindle | Pigment clumps (less distinct spindle) |
| **Iris** | Radial Transillumination defects | Peripupillary atrophy (Moth-eaten), ruff atrophy |
| **Lens** | Zentmayer's line | Target sign (3 zones on anterior capsule) |
| **Angle** | Sampaolesi line, Heavy Pigmentation | Sampaolesi line, Pigment + White dandruff material |

### **Clinical Course**
*   **Symptoms:** Often asymptomatic, but patients may report intermittent colored halos or blurred vision, especially after exercise or pupil dilation (which releases more pigment).
*   **Prognosis:** Generally good. The condition may "burn out" with age as the lens grows larger, pushing the iris away from the zonules, reducing friction. However, long-term monitoring is essential as field loss occurs in some eyes.

### **Management**
The treatment protocol generally follows the lines of [[Primary Open Angle Glaucoma]] (POAG),.

#### **1. Medical Management**
*   **[[Miotics]] (e.g., Pilocarpine):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Constricts the pupil and makes the iris taut, pulling it away from the zonules, thus reversing the mechanical rubbing.
    *   **Limitation:** Poorly tolerated in young myopes due to accommodation spasm and induced myopia.
*   **Other Anti-glaucoma drugs:** [[Prostaglandin Analogues]], [[Beta Blockers]], and Alpha-agonists are used to lower IOP as in POAG.

#### **2. Laser Therapy**
*   **[[Laser Trabeculoplasty]] (ALT/SLT):**
    *   Often very effective in pigmentary glaucoma because the laser energy is well-absorbed by the heavily pigmented trabecular meshwork.
    *   **Caution:** Lower energy settings should be used to avoid pressure spikes or excessive inflammation.
*   **Laser Iridotomy (LPI):** Can be used to equalize pressure between the anterior and posterior chambers, flattening the iris and relieving the "reverse pupillary block," though its routine use is debated,.

#### **3. Surgical Management**
*   **[[Trabeculectomy]]:** Indicated if medical and laser therapies fail to control IOP or if there is progressive optic neuropathy.
*   **Glaucoma Drainage Devices:** Used in refractory cases.
