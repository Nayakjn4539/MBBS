# [[Lower Limb]] > Jones Fracture vs Pseudo-Jones Fracture

### Anatomy of the Fifth Metatarsal Base

Fractures of the proximal [[fifth metatarsal]] are divided into three distinct zones based on anatomical location and prognosis. Understanding these zones is critical for accurate diagnosis and management.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Drawing of the proximal fifth metatarsal divided into three zones. Zone 1: The tuberosity/styloid process at the very base. Zone 2: The metaphyseal-diaphyseal junction. Zone 3: The proximal diaphysis distal to Zone 2.

1.  **Zone 1:** The **tuberosity** or styloid process. This is the insertion site of the [[Peroneus Brevis]] tendon and the lateral band of the plantar fascia.
2.  **Zone 2:** The **metaphyseal-diaphyseal junction**. This area involves the articulation between the fourth and fifth metatarsals.
3.  **Zone 3:** The **proximal diaphysis**, distal to the fourth-fifth metatarsal articulation. Usually associated with stress fractures.

### Pseudo-Jones Fracture (Zone 1 Injury)

Also known as **Tennis Fracture** or **Dancer's Fracture**.

*   **Definition:** An avulsion fracture of the tuberosity (base) of the 5th metatarsal. It involves **Zone 1**.
*   **Mechanism of Injury:** 
    *   Forcible **inversion** of the foot while in plantar flexion.
    *   Reflex contraction of the [[Peroneus Brevis]] muscle causes avulsion of the styloid process.
    *   Can also be caused by the pull of the lateral cord of the plantar fascia.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Pain and swelling at the base of the 5th metatarsal.
    *   Difficulty walking, but patient can often bear weight.
*   **Prognosis:** **Excellent**. This area has a robust blood supply (cancellous bone).
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Conservative:** This is the standard of care.
    *   Compression bandage, stiff-soled shoe, or a walking cast/boot for 3–4 weeks.
    *   Symptomatic relief is the goal; union is almost guaranteed.

### Jones Fracture (Zone 2 Injury)

Named after **Sir Robert Jones**, who described the injury in 1902 (he sustained it while dancing).

*   **Definition:** A transverse fracture at the **metaphyseal-diaphyseal junction** (Zone 2) of the 5th metatarsal. It extends into the intermetatarsal joint (between 4th and 5th metatarsals).
*   **Mechanism of Injury:**
    *   **Adduction** force applied to the forefoot while the ankle is plantar-flexed.
    *   Often occurs with a pivot or twist (e.g., misstep on a curb, pivoting in sports).
*   **Pathophysiology (The "Danger" Zone):**
    *   This fracture occurs in a vascular **[[Watershed Area]]**.
    *   The blood supply here is tenuous, leading to a high risk of **[[Delayed Union]]** or **[[Non-union]]**.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Non-Operative:** Strictly **non-weight bearing** short leg cast for 6–8 weeks.
    *   **Operative:** Often indicated for high-performance athletes or active individuals to ensure healing and faster return to activity.
        *   **Intramedullary Screw Fixation:** [[Intramedullary Screw]] (e.g., Herbert screw) is the gold standard surgical treatment.

### Comparison: Jones vs. Pseudo-Jones Fracture

| Feature | **Pseudo-Jones Fracture** | **Jones Fracture** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Anatomical Zone** | **Zone 1** (Tuberosity/Base) | **Zone 2** (Metaphyseal-Diaphyseal Junction) |
| **Mechanism** | Inversion (Avulsion by [[Peroneus Brevis]]) | Adduction force on plantar-flexed foot |
| **Intra-articular?** | Usually Extra-articular (may involve cuboid joint) | Often extends into 4th-5th intermetatarsal joint |
| **Blood Supply** | Good (Rich metaphyseal supply) | Poor (**[[Watershed Area]]**) |
| **Risk of Non-union** | Very Low | **High** |
| **Treatment** | **Symptomatic:** Walking cast/boot, elastic bandage (3-4 weeks) | **Strict:** Non-weight bearing cast (6-8 weeks) or Surgery ([[Intramedullary Screw]]) |

### Clinical Implications

*   **Differentiation is Vital:** Mistaking a Jones fracture for a Pseudo-Jones fracture can lead to disastrous results. Treating a Jones fracture symptomatically (like a sprain or avulsion) frequently results in [[Non-union]], requiring secondary surgery and bone grafting.
*   **Zone 3 (Stress Fractures):** While Jones fractures (Zone 2) are acute, fractures in **Zone 3** (proximal diaphysis) are often stress fractures seen in athletes. These have the highest rate of non-union and almost always require surgical fixation.

### Mnemonics

**"JONES"**
*   **J**unction of Metaphysis/Diaphysis (Location)
*   **O**perative (often needed)
*   **N**on-union risk (High)
*   **E**xtends into 4th-5th intermetatarsal joint
*   **S**trict non-weight bearing

**"P-J" for Pseudo-Jones**
*   **P**eroneus brevis pull
*   **P**roximal (most proximal tip)
*   **P**retty good outcome (heals well)
