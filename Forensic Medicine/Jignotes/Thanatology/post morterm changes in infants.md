# [[Thanatology]] > post morterm changes in infants

### Postmortem Changes in Infants

The progression of [[postmortem changes]] in infants differs significantly from adults due to their smaller body mass, higher surface area-to-mass ratio, and sterile environment (in cases of intrauterine death). These changes are broadly classified based on whether the death occurred **in utero** (Maceration) or **after birth** (Putrefaction).

### 1. General Postmortem Changes (Cooling & Rigidity)

#### Algor Mortis (Cooling)
*   **Rate:** Infants cool much faster than adults.
*   **Reason:** Large surface area relative to body weight and less subcutaneous fat.
*   **Significance:** [[Algor mortis]] is a quicker process; the body attains environmental temperature rapidly.

#### Rigor Mortis (Cadaveric Rigidity)
*   **Onset and Duration:** Appears and disappears more rapidly in infants compared to adults.
*   **Fetal Age Factor:** [[Rigor mortis]] is generally **not** seen in a fetus less than 7 months of gestation.
*   **Mechanism:** In very young fetuses, the muscle mass is insufficient to produce palpable rigidity. In full-term infants, it may be feeble and fleeting.

### 2. Maceration (Intrauterine/Sterile Decomposition)
This is the most specific change seen in infants who die *in utero* (dead-born) and remain there for some time (usually 24 hours or more) before expulsion. It is a process of **aseptic autolysis**.

**Pathophysiology:**
*   Since the fetus is enclosed in the amniotic sac, the body is sterile (no bacteria).
*   Decomposition occurs due to the body's own enzymes (autolysis) and the fluid medium (amniotic fluid).
*   **Crucial Medicolegal Point:** Maceration indicates **death in utero** (Dead born). It is **never** seen in a live-born child or a child who died after birth.

**Signs of Maceration:**
*   **Odor:** Sour, rancid, or sweetish disagreeable smell (distinct from the foul smell of putrefaction).
*   **Skin Slippage:** The epidermis separates from the dermis. This begins within **12–24 hours** of death. The skin peels off in patches.
*   **Discoloration:** The body appears reddish or copper-red (like a boiled lobster) due to hemolysis of blood and absorption of hemoglobin by the tissues.
*   **Consistency:** The body becomes soft, flaccid, and flattened (loss of contour).
*   **Viscera:** Internal organs become soft, pulpy, and unidentifiable (resembling thick red soup), but anatomical relationships may remain.
*   **Umbilical Cord:** Becomes thickened, soft, and stained red.

**Radiological Signs of Intrauterine Death (Maceration):**
1.  **[[Spalding's Sign]]:** Overriding of the cranial bones (sutures) due to liquefaction of the brain and collapse of the skull. usually appears in **4–7 days**.
2.  **[[Robert's Sign]]:** Presence of gas shadows in the heart, aorta, and great vessels. Appears within **12 hours**.
3.  **Ball's Sign:** Hyperflexion of the spine due to loss of muscle tone.

### 3. Putrefaction (Septic Decomposition)
This occurs if the infant was **born alive** or if the amniotic sac ruptured prior to death, allowing bacterial invasion.

**Mechanism:** Breakdown of tissues by bacteria (Clostridium welchii) leading to gas formation.

**Key Features in Infants:**
*   **Onset:** Rapid due to high moisture content and often warmer environment.
*   **External Appearances:**
    *   Greenish discoloration of the abdomen.
    *   Bloating of the body and scrotum.
    *   **Skull Sutures:** In 3 to 5 days, the sutures of the skull separate, and the liquefied brain matter runs out.
    *   **Skin:** "Glove and stocking" peeling of skin from hands and feet.
*   **Internal Organs:**
    *   Stomach and intestines decompose early.
    *   [[Foamy liver]] (honeycomb appearance) due to gas bubbles.

### 4. Mummification and Adipocere
*   **[[Mummification]]:** Can occur if the infant's body is disposed of in a dry, hot environment (e.g., concealed in a trunk, box, or dry sand). The body shrivels, dries, and becomes leathery. This preserves injuries and helps in identification.
*   **[[Adipocere]]:** Can occur if the body is disposed of in wet/damp conditions. The fat turns into a waxy, soap-like substance.

### Differentiation: Maceration vs. Putrefaction

| Feature | **Maceration** | **Putrefaction** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cause** | Aseptic Autolysis (Enzymatic) | Bacterial Decomposition (Septic) |
| **Environment** | Sterile (Intra-uterine) | Non-sterile (Extra-uterine or ruptured membranes) |
| **Smell** | Sour / Sweetish / Rancid | Foul / Rotten egg (H₂S) |
| **Gas Formation** | Absent (Body is flaccid/flat) | Present (Body is bloated/distended) |
| **Color** | Reddish / Copper-colored | Greenish / Blackish |
| **Significance** | Indicates **Dead Born** | Indicates exposure to bacteria (Live birth or prolonged rupture) |

### Medicolegal Aspects & Autopsy Findings

**1. Determining Viability and Age:**
*   Postmortem examination of ossification centers (lower end of femur, calcaneum, talus) helps determine the gestational age and viability.
*   **[[Rule of Hasse]]:** Used to estimate fetal age based on length.
    *   < 25 cm: $\sqrt{Length}$ = Age in months.
    *   > 25 cm: $Length / 5$ = Age in months.

**2. Live Birth vs. Dead Birth:**
*   **Live Birth:** Lungs are expanded, spongy, float in water (**[[Hydrostatic Test]]** positive), stomach contains air (**Breslau’s test** positive). Umbilical cord shows vital reaction (reddening/separation ring).
*   **Dead Born (Stillborn):** Lungs are liver-like (solid), sink in water (Hydrostatic test negative). Signs of maceration are often present.

**3. Time Since Death (TSD):**
*   **12-24 hours:** Skin slippage (Maceration).
*   **3-5 days:** Separation of skull sutures and liquefaction of brain.
*   **Entomology:** Maggots appear earlier in open wounds or orifices (within 8-24 hours).
