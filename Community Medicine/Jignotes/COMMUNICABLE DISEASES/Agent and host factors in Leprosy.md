# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Agent and host factors in Leprosy

# Epidemiological Determinants of Leprosy

The epidemiology of **Leprosy** (Hansen's Disease) is determined by the interaction between the agent ([[Mycobacterium leprae]]) and the host (Man).

## 1. Agent Factors (The Seed)

**A. Causative Agent:**
*   **Organism:** [[Mycobacterium leprae]].
*   **Characteristics:** It is a gram-positive, acid-fast bacillus,.
*   **Arrangement:** They typically occur in clumps or bundles known as **[[Globi]]**, mostly inside the cells (intracellular),.
*   **Affinity:** It has a unique predilection for **[[Schwann cells]]** (nerve tissue) and cells of the Reticulo-Endothelial System (RES).
*   **Cultivation:** It **cannot** be grown in artificial culture media. It is cultivated in the **[[9-banded armadillo]]** and mouse footpads,.
*   **Generation Time:** It has a very long generation time of **12–13 days** (slow multiplication).

**B. Source of Infection:**
*   **Multibacillary Cases:** [[Lepromatous]] (LL) and Borderline Lepromatous (BL) cases are the most important sources ("Open cases"),.
*   **Bacterial Load:** An untreated lepromatous patient can discharge millions of bacilli per day.
*   **Sub-clinical Cases:** Inapparent or sub-clinical infections also act as a reservoir,.

**C. Portal of Exit:**
*   **Nose:** The **[[Nasal Mucosa]]** is the major portal of exit. Patients discharge bacilli when sneezing or blowing the nose,.
*   **Skin:** Ulcerated or broken skin can be an exit point, but intact skin is generally not considered a route of exit.

**D. Infectivity vs. Pathogenicity:**
*   **High Infectivity:** It spreads easily among populations.
*   **Low Pathogenicity:** Only a small proportion of those infected actually develop clinical disease,.

**E. Viability:**
*   The bacillus is hardy. It can survive in **dried nasal secretions** for 9 days and in **moist soil** for up to 46 days.

> **Mnemonic for Agent:** **G-L-O-B-I**
> *   **G** - Grows in Armadillo/Mouse footpad (Not artificial media)
> *   **L** - Long generation time (12-13 days)
> *   **O** - Only **Open cases** (Multibacillary) are major sources
> *   **B** - Blows from **Nose** (Major exit)
> *   **I** - Intracellular (Likes Schwann cells)

## 2. Host Factors (The Soil)

**A. Age:**
*   **Susceptibility:** Infection can occur at any age if exposed,.
*   **Peak Incidence:** Usually seen between **20–30 years** of age.
*   **Children:** High prevalence in children (0-14 years) is an epidemiological indicator that the disease is **active and spreading** in the community.
    *   *Note:* The youngest case recorded in India was an infant of **2.5 months**.

**B. Sex:**
*   **Males > Females:** The disease is generally more common in men with a ratio of roughly **2:1** or **3:2**,.
*   **Reason:** Likely due to greater mobility and increased opportunities for contact among males in many populations.

**C. Immunity:**
*   **[[Cell-Mediated Immunity (CMI)]]:** This is the **deciding factor** for the type of leprosy a patient develops.
    *   **Strong CMI:** Limits the disease $\rightarrow$ **[[Tuberculoid Leprosy]]** (localized, often self-healing).
    *   **Weak/Absent CMI:** Bacteria multiply unchecked $\rightarrow$ **[[Lepromatous Leprosy]]** (generalized, severe).
*   **Antibodies:** Humoral immunity (antibodies) is present but is **not effective** in destroying the bacilli.

**D. Genetic Factors:**
*   There is evidence that **[[HLA-linked genes]]** influence the host's immune response type (susceptibility to Tuberculoid vs. Lepromatous forms),.
*   Concordance is higher in monozygotic twins than heterozygotic twins.

**E. Migration:**
*   Movement of population from rural to urban areas has turned leprosy into an urban problem in India (previously considered a rural problem).

**F. Socio-Economic Factors:**
*   Associated with poverty, overcrowding, and lack of ventilation which favor transmission,.

### Table: Host Response Spectrum (The Ridley-Jopling Scale)

| Type | Immune Status (CMI) | Bacterial Load |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TT (Tuberculoid)** | **High** (Good resistance) | Very Low (Paucibacillary) |
| **BT (Borderline Tuberculoid)**| Moderate | Low |
| **BB (Mid-Borderline)** | Unstable | Moderate |
| **BL (Borderline Lepromatous)**| Low | High |
| **LL (Lepromatous)** | **Absent** (Anergy) | Very High (Multibacillary) |

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Lepromin Test:** This is **NOT** a diagnostic test. It is used to assess the **Host Immunity (CMI)** and classify the type of leprosy. It is positive in Tuberculoid (TT) and negative in Lepromatous (LL) cases,.
*   **Incubation Period:** It is exceptionally long, averaging **3 to 5 years**.
