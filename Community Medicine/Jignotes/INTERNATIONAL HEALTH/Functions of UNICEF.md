# [[INTERNATIONAL HEALTH]] > Functions of UNICEF

### Functions of [[UNICEF]] (United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund)

UNICEF is a specialized agency of the United Nations, established in 1946 initially to help children in war-ravaged countries. Currently, its focus has shifted from specific disease eradication campaigns to the concept of the **"[[Whole Child]]"**, addressing the needs of children as an integral part of a country's development.

The main functions and areas of service can be categorized as follows:

#### 1. Child Health
UNICEF provides substantial aid for the production of vaccines and sera to fight major communicable diseases.
*   **Vaccine Production:** It has supported India's [[BCG vaccination]] programme and helped establish a Penicillin plant (Pune), a DDT plant (Delhi), and units for the manufacture of Triple Vaccine (DPT) and Tetanus Toxoid.
*   **Primary Health Care (PHC):** Focuses on immunization, infant care, family planning, and control of infectious diseases.
*   **Sanitation:** Assists in environmental sanitation programs, emphasizing safe drinking water.

#### 2. Child Nutrition
Malnutrition is a priority area. UNICEF moved from simply distributing milk to long-term nutritional strategies.
*   **Supplementary Feeding:** Development of low-cost protein-rich food mixtures.
*   **Applied Nutrition Programme:** Collaborates with [[FAO]] to help rural populations grow and eat nutritious foods (kitchen gardens, poultry, fisheries).
*   **Micronutrient Supplementation:**
    *   **Vitamin A:** Prophylaxis against [[Xerophthalmia]] (nutritional blindness).
    *   **Iodine:** Enrichment of salt (Universal Iodization) to control [[Goitre]].
    *   **Iron/Folate:** To combat anemia in mothers and children.

#### 3. Family and Child Welfare
The aim is to improve the care of children within and outside their homes.
*   **Parental Education:** Teaching parents about child-rearing and health.
*   **Day Care:** Establishing day-care centers and creches for children of working mothers.
*   **Training:** Training of child welfare workers.

#### 4. Education (Formal and Non-Formal)
*   **Science Education:** UNICEF assists in the expansion and improvement of science teaching (e.g., providing laboratory equipment, library books, and audio-visual aids).
*   **Relevance:** Emphasizes schooling that is relevant to the child's environment and future life.

### The [[GOBI-FFF]] Campaign
UNICEF promotes a low-cost, high-impact strategy known as the "Child Health Revolution" centered around the GOBI-FFF campaign to reduce child mortality.

### Clinical & Public Health Relevance
*   **Cold Chain:** UNICEF plays a critical role in supplying [[Cold Chain]] equipment (ILRs, Deep Freezers) essential for the [[Universal Immunization Programme]] (UIP) in India.

*   **Emergency Relief:** Provides rapid humanitarian aid during natural disasters (floods, earthquakes) or conflicts.

### Mnemonic
To remember the core functions of UNICEF, think of **"NEW C"**:

*   **N** - **N**utrition (Iodine, Vit A, Applied Nutrition)
*   **E** - **E**ducation (Science kits, GOBI)
*   **W** - **W**elfare (Family and Child welfare)
*   **C** - **C**hild Health (Vaccines, PHC)

*(And always remember **GOBI-FFF** for the specific strategies!)*
