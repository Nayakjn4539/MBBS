### Classification: Types of Families

Families are classified based on structure and membership.

#### 1. [[Nuclear Family]] (Elementary/Unitary Family)
*   **Definition:** Consists of a married couple and their dependent children living together,.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Universal in human societies.
    *   Husband usually plays the dominant role.
    *   Greater burden on parents for child-rearing due to lack of support from other relatives.
    *   **New Family:** A variant of nuclear family, less than 10 years duration,.

#### 2. [[Joint Family]] (Extended Family)
*   **Definition:** A group of married couples and their children living together in the same household,.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Consanguineous:** All men are related by blood; women are wives/daughters/widows,.
    *   **Common Property/Purse:** Income is pooled; expenditure met from a common purse,.
    *   **Authority:** Vested in the senior male member (Karta).
    *   **Motto:** "Union is Strength" – provides social security to the old, helpless, and unemployed.

#### 3. [[Three Generation Family]]
*   **Definition:** A household containing representatives of three generations (e.g., young couple, their parents, and their children) related by direct descent,.
*   **Context:** Common in the West when young couples cannot find separate housing.

#### 4. [[Problem Family]]

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I** | Formation | Marriage | Birth of 1st Child |
| **II** | Extension | Birth of 1st Child | Birth of Last Child |
| **III** | Complete Extension | Birth of Last Child | 1st Child leaves home |
| **IV** | Contraction | 1st Child leaves home | Last Child leaves home |
| **V** | Completed Contraction | Last Child leaves home | 1st Spouse dies |

### Family in [[Health and Disease]] (Clinical Relevance)

The family is the "Fulcrum of Health Services".

**1. Child Rearing**
*   Physical care of the dependent young to ensure survival.
*   **Relevance:** Tradition determines nutrition, hygiene, and discipline. Poor rearing leads to malnutrition and infection.

**2. Socialization**
*   Teaching young ones values, culture, and codes of conduct,.
*   **Relevance:** Helps individuals function effectively in society. Schools and religion assist in this.

**3. Personality Formation**
*   Family acts as a **"Placenta"**, filtering external influences,.
*   **Relevance:** Early family experience determines an individual's capacity to withstand stress and mental health.

**4. Care of Dependent Adults**
*   **Sick/Injured:** Family provides frontline nursing care (often more than hospitals),.
*   **Pregnancy:** Care during recognized dependency periods affects maternal/infant mortality.
*   **Aged/Handicapped:** Joint families provide essential support for the elderly.

**5. Stabilization of Adult Personality**
*   Family acts as a **"Shock Absorber"** for life's stresses (injury, death, worry),.
*   **Relevance:** Lack of this support contributes to mental illness, alcoholism, and stress diseases like hypertension and peptic ulcer,.

**6. Familial Susceptibility to Disease**
*   Members share a **pool of genes** and a **common environment**.
*   **Relevance:**
    *   *Genetic:* Hemophilia, color blindness, diabetes, schizophrenia run in families,.
    *   *Infectious:* TB, measles, common cold spread rapidly due to shared environment,.
