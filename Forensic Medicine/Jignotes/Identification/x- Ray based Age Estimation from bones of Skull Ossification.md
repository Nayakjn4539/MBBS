# [[Identification]] > x- Ray based Age Estimation from bones of Skull Ossification

### **Age Estimation from Skull Ossification**

Estimation of age from the skull relies on the appearance and fusion of [[ossification centers]], closure of [[fontanelles]], and the obliteration of cranial [[sutures]]. This method is generally used when other reliable bones (like the pelvis or long bones) are unavailable or to corroborate findings.

#### **1. Closure of Fontanelles**
Fontanelles are membrane-filled spaces located where the sutures intersect. Their closure provides a reliable estimate for age in infants and toddlers.

| **Fontanelle** | **Location** | **Age of Closure** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Posterior** (Occipital) | Junction of sagittal and lambdoid sutures | 2 to 3 months |
| **Sphenoidal** (Anterolateral) | Pterion | 2 to 3 months |
| **Mastoid** (Posterolateral) | Asterion | 1 year |
| **Anterior** (Bregmatic) | Junction of sagittal and coronal sutures | 1.5 to 2 years (18–24 months) |

> **Note:** The anterior fontanelle is diamond-shaped and measures approximately 4 x 2.5 cm at birth.

#### **2. Obliteration of Cranial Sutures**
Suture closure is a continuous process but is subject to high individual variability. It proceeds from **Endocranium** (inner table) to **Ectocranium** (outer table).
*   **Endocranial fusion:** Starts earlier (5–10 years before ectocranial) and is more reliable. It is examined using a torchlight through the [[foramen magnum]].
*   **Ectocranial fusion:** Starts later and is erratic; hence, less reliable for precise age estimation.

**General Sequence of Closure:**
1.  **Metopic Suture:** Starts fusing at 2 years; completed by 6–8 years.
    *   *Persistence:* In about 2–8% of individuals, it fails to fuse, a condition known as [[Metopism]]. This should not be mistaken for a fracture.
2.  **Basilar Suture (Spheno-Occipital Joint):** This is a synchondrosis between the basi-sphenoid and basi-occiput.
    *   **Fusion Age:** 18 to 22 years,.
    *   **Significance:** It is a key indicator for assessing the age of majority (18–21 years).

**Table: Timeline of Vault Suture Closure (Endocranial)**

| **Suture** | **Onset of Fusion** | **Completion of Fusion** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sagittal** | 25–30 years | 40–50 years |
| **Coronal** | 30–35 years | 50–60 years |
| **Lambdoid** | 35–40 years | 60–70 years |
| **Temporo-parietal** | Late (starts ~60 years) | Often remains open |

**Mnemonics for Suture Closure Order:**
**"S-C-L"** (Like "School")
*   **S**agittal (First)
*   **C**oronal (Second)
*   **L**ambdoid (Last)

#### **3. Age Estimation from Mandible**
The [[mandible]] undergoes significant morphological changes from infancy to old age, visible on X-ray.

| **Feature** | **Infant** | **Adult** | **Old Age (Edentulous)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Angle of Mandible** | Obtuse (~140°) | Almost Right Angle (~110–120°) | Obtuse (~140°) due to alveolar resorption |
| **Mental Foramen Position** | Near the lower border | Midway between upper and lower borders | Near the upper (alveolar) border |
| **Condyle** | Projects backward | Projects upward | Projects backward |

#### **4. Age-Related Changes in Teeth (Radiological)**
While clinical eruption is used in the living, X-rays are vital for the dead/skeletal remains.
*   **Mineralization:** Begins at the cusp tips and proceeds to the roots.
*   **Neonatal Line:** A hypoplastic line in enamel and dentin seen in histological section (via microscopy, but relevant to identification context) indicates **live birth**.
*   **Root Resorption:** In deciduous teeth, roots resorb as permanent teeth push upward.
*   **Secondary Dentin:** Visible as narrowing of the pulp cavity on X-ray in older adults (part of [[Gustafson's method]]).

#### **5. Other Skull Indicators**
*   **Pituitary Fossa:** Changes in the profile of the pituitary fossa on X-ray can assist in identification.
*   **Frontal Sinuses:** No two pairs are identical. Their unique scallop patterns on X-ray serve as a "fingerprint" for personal identification rather than just age.
*   **Bone Texture:** Old skulls become thinner, lighter, and more brittle due to the loss of diploe and absorption of bone.

#### **Medicolegal Aspects**
*   **Variability:** Suture closure is highly variable. A skull may show complete closure at 40 years or remain open at 80 years. Therefore, age should always be given as a **range** (e.g., ± 5 to 10 years) rather than a specific number.
*   **Premature Closure:** Conditions like [[craniosynostosis]] can cause early closure, leading to skull deformities (e.g., scaphocephaly).
*   **Gender Differences:** Suture closure tends to start earlier in males but is completed earlier in females.
*   **Reliability:** The **Basilar suture** (18–22 years) is the most reliable skull marker for age. Once the sutures of the vault are involved (after 25 years), reliability drops significantly compared to the pelvis or sternal ends of ribs,.
