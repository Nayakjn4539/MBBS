### Disorders of Sexual Development (DSD) / Sexual Dysgenesis

[[Disorders of Sexual Development]] (DSD), formerly known as **Intersex**, are congenital conditions where the chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is atypical. These are disorders of sexual differentiation resulting in an individual possessing sexual characteristics intermediate between a male and a female.

The **Chicago Consensus (2005)** recommended replacing terms like "hermaphrodite" and "intersex" with **DSD**.

### Classification of DSD

Currently, DSD is classified based on the karyotype (chromosomal constitution):

1.  **Sex Chromosome DSD:**
    *   [[Turner Syndrome]] (45,X)
    *   [[Klinefelter Syndrome]] (47,XXY)
    *   Mixed Gonadal Dysgenesis (45,X / 46,XY mosaicism)
    *   Chimerism (46,XX / 46,XY)

2.  **46,XY DSD (Formerly Male Pseudohermaphroditism):**
    *   Defects in androgen synthesis or action.
    *   **Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS)** or Testicular Feminization Syndrome.
    *   5-alpha reductase deficiency.

3.  **46,XX DSD (Formerly Female Pseudohermaphroditism):**
    *   Androgen excess (e.g., [[Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia]]).

4.  **Ovotesticular DSD (Formerly True Hermaphroditism):**
    *   Presence of both ovarian and testicular tissue.

### Specific Clinical Conditions

#### 1. Klinefelter Syndrome (Seminiferous Tubule Dysgenesis)
*   **Genotype:** **47,XXY** (Trisomy of sex chromosomes).
*   **Phenotype:** Male.
*   **Incidence:** 1 in 1000 live male births.
*   **Nuclear Sexing:** **Barr body Positive**.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Tall stature with long limbs (eunuchoid proportions).
    *   **Gynecomastia** (enlargement of male breast).
    *   Small, firm, fibrotic testes (atrophic).
    *   **Azoospermia** (Sterile).
    *   Sparse facial and body hair (female pattern).
    *   High-pitched voice.
    *   Mental retardation or behavioral issues may be present.

> **Mnemonic for Klinefelter:** **K**linefelter = **K**iss (Females kiss, so female-like features in male).
> **TALL** Series: **T**all stature, **A**trophic testes, **L**ow IQ/Libido, **L**ong limbs.

#### 2. Turner Syndrome (Gonadal Dysgenesis)
*   **Genotype:** **45,X** (Monosomy X).
*   **Phenotype:** Female.
*   **Incidence:** 1 in 3000 live female births.
*   **Nuclear Sexing:** **Barr body Negative**.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Short stature.
    *   **Webbing of the neck** (Pterygium colli).
    *   Shield-shaped chest with widely spaced nipples.
    *   **Streak ovaries** (rudimentary gonadal tissue).
    *   Primary **Amenorrhea** and Sterility.
    *   **Cubitus valgus** (increased carrying angle of elbow).
    *   Coarctation of the aorta.

> **Mnemonic for Turner:** **CLOWNS**
> **C**ardiac anomalies (Coarctation)
> **L**ymphoedema (hands/feet)
> **O**varies streak (Sterile)
> **W**ebbed neck
> **N**ipples spaced widely
> **S**hort stature

#### 3. Super Female (Triple-X Syndrome)
*   **Genotype:** 47,XXX.
*   **Phenotype:** Female.
*   **Features:** Mental retardation, sexual infantilism, scanty menses. Two Barr bodies are present.

#### 4. Super Male (XYY Syndrome)
*   **Genotype:** 47,XYY.
*   **Phenotype:** Male.
*   **Features:** Tall stature, aggressive behavior, criminal tendency, mental instability.

#### 5. True Hermaphroditism (Ovotesticular DSD)
*   **Definition:** Presence of both ovarian and testicular tissue in the same individual.
*   **Gonads:** May present as:
    *   One ovary and one testis (Lateral).
    *   **Ovotestis** (gonad containing both tissues) on one or both sides.
*   **Genitalia:** Ambiguous.
*   **Secondary Sexual Characters:** Mixed (breasts may develop, menstruation may occur).
*   **Karyotype:** Most commonly 46,XX (approx 60%), followed by mosaics.

#### 6. Pseudohermaphroditism
Here, the gonadal tissue of only one sex is present, but the external genitalia resemble the opposite sex.

| Feature | Male Pseudohermaphroditism (46,XY DSD) | Female Pseudohermaphroditism (46,XX DSD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Genotype** | **46,XY** (Chromosomal Male) | **46,XX** (Chromosomal Female) |
| **Gonads** | **Testes** are present (often undescended). | **Ovaries** are present (internal). |
| **External Genitalia** | Female or Ambiguous. | Male or Ambiguous (Virilized). |
| **Cause** | **Testicular Feminization / AIS**: Target tissues are insensitive to androgens. | **Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)**: Excess androgen production by adrenal cortex. |
| **Features** | Blind vagina, no uterus, scant pubic hair, breast development (due to aromatization). | Clitoromegaly (looks like penis), fused labia (looks like scrotum). |

### Diagnosis and Identification

Identification of sex in DSD cases involves a multi-modal approach:

1.  **Clinical Examination:**
    *   Inspection of external genitalia (ambiguity, phallus size, urethral opening).
    *   Palpation of inguinal canal/scrotum for gonads.
    *   Assessment of secondary sexual characteristics (Breast, Hair, Voice).

2.  **Nuclear Sexing (Microscopic):**
    *   **[[Barr Body]] (Sex Chromatin):** Seen in buccal mucosal scrapings. It is a plano-convex mass near the nuclear membrane (inactivated X chromosome).
        *   Formula: Number of Barr bodies = (Number of X chromosomes) - 1.
        *   **Female (XX):** Positive (1 Barr body).
        *   **Male (XY):** Negative (0 Barr bodies).
    *   **[[Davidson Body]] (Neutrophil Drumstick):** Seen in Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (Neutrophils). Small nuclear attachment shaped like a drumstick.
        *   Seen in females.

3.  **Karyotyping (Chromosomal Analysis):**
    *   **Gold Standard** for determining genetic sex.
    *   Culture of lymphocytes to visualize chromosomes (e.g., 46,XY or 45,X).

4.  **Hormonal Assay:**
    *   Estimation of Testosterone, Estrogen, FSH, LH, and 17-ketosteroids.

5.  **Biopsy:**
    *   Gonadal biopsy to confirm the presence of ovarian follicles or seminiferous tubules.

6.  **Ultrasonography/MRI:**
    *   To visualize internal organs (Uterus, Ovaries, Prostate).

### Medicolegal Aspects

1.  **Identity:** Sex determination is a primary component of establishing [[Corpus Delicti]] and personal identity in living and dead.
2.  **Marriage:**
    *   In India, marriage is legal only between a male and a female.
    *   Concealment of DSD condition can be a ground for **Nullity of Marriage** (voidable marriage) under Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, usually on grounds of [[Impotence]] (inability to consummate).
    *   Divorce may be granted if the respondent has been suffering from a continuous mental disorder (often associated with some DSDs) or incurable form of leprosy/VD, but specifically for DSD, nullity due to impotence is the main legal recourse.
3.  **Legitimacy and Inheritance:**
    *   Issues of inheritance often depend on the sex of the heir.
    *   Paternity issues may arise if a person with DSD claims or denies parentage (though most are sterile).
4.  **Sexual Offences:**
    *   **Rape (Sec 375 IPC/Sec 63 BNS):** Defined as an act by a man against a woman. Determination of sex is crucial to apply these sections.
    *   **Sodomy/Unnatural Offences (Sec 377 IPC):** Can be applied regardless of sex, but medical examination of the victim requires determination of anatomical status.
5.  **Sports:**
    *   [[Sex Verification]] is required in international athletic events to ensure fair competition (e.g., Caster Semenya case).
6.  **Civil Rights:**
    *   Right to vote, employment, and identification documents. The Supreme Court of India (NALSA judgment) recognizes the **"Third Gender"** to protect the rights of transgender/intersex individuals.
