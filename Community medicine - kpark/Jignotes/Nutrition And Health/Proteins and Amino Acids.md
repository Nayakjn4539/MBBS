# [[Nutrition And Health]] > Proteins and Amino Acids

### Proteins and Amino Acids

**Proteins** are complex organic nitrogenous compounds composed of Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Sulphur. Nitrogen content is approximately **16%**. They are the building blocks of the body necessary for growth, repair, and maintenance of osmotic pressure [[Proteins]].

#### **Amino Acids**
Proteins are made of smaller units called [[Amino Acids]].
*   **Essential (Indispensable) Amino Acids (EAA):** Cannot be synthesized by the body and must be obtained from the diet.
*   **Non-Essential Amino Acids:** Can be synthesized by the body.

**Mnemonic for Essential Amino Acids: PVT TIM HALL**
*   **P**henylalanine
*   **V**aline
*   **T**hreonine
*   **T**ryptophan
*   **I**soleucine
*   **M**ethionine
*   **H**istidine (Semi-essential/Conditionally essential for infants)
*   **A**rginine (Semi-essential)
*   **L**eucine
*   **L**ysine.

#### **Assessment of Protein Quality**
1.  **Biological Value (BV):** The percentage of absorbed nitrogen retained by the body. **Egg** has the highest BV (96) and is considered the **Reference Protein**.
    *   $BV = \frac{\text{Nitrogen Retained}}{\text{Nitrogen Absorbed}} \times 100$
2.  **Net Protein Utilization (NPU):** The product of Biological Value and Digestibility Coefficient. It is the best indicator for determining dietary protein requirements.
    *   $NPU = \frac{\text{Nitrogen Retained}}{\text{Nitrogen Intake}} \times 100$
3.  **Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER):** Weight gain per gram of protein consumed. Used for growing infants.
4.  **DIAAS (Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score):** Currently recommended by FAO as the preferred method, replacing PDCAAS.

**Clinical Relevance: Supplementary Action of Proteins**
*   **Cereals** are deficient in **Lysine** and Threonine.
*   **Pulses** are deficient in **Methionine** and Cysteine.
*   **Solution:** Eating Cereals and Pulses together (e.g., Dal-Rice or Khichdi) complements the amino acid profile, creating a balanced protein intake [[Balanced Diet]].

### Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM)

PEM is a pathological state resulting from the relative or absolute deficiency of protein and/or calories. It is often described as an **"Iceberg Phenomenon"**, where clinical cases (Kwashiorkor/Marasmus) are merely the tip, while mild/moderate malnutrition forms the massive submerged portion.

#### **1. Kwashiorkor**
*   **Meaning:** "The sickness the older child gets when the next baby is born" (displaced from breast milk to starchy diet).
*   **Etiology/Agent:** Severe **Protein deficiency** with relatively adequate caloric intake.
*   **Host:** Typically affects children aged **1–3 years** (Toddlers).
*   **Pathogenesis:** Hypoalbuminemia leads to fluid retention (Edema) and fatty liver (reduced lipoprotein synthesis).

**Clinical Picture:**
*   **Edema:** Pitting edema starting in legs, progressing to **Moon Face**.
*   **Growth Failure:** Masked by edema.
*   **Mental Changes:** Child is **Apathetic**, dull, lethargic, and miserable.
*   **Hair Changes:** Sparse, silky, easily pluckable. **Flag Sign** (alternating bands of light and dark hair due to periods of poor and good nutrition).
*   **Skin Changes:** **Flaky Paint Dermatosis** (dark, peeling skin like old paint) especially on buttocks/thighs.
*   **Liver:** Hepatomegaly due to fatty infiltration (Steatosis).

#### **2. Marasmus**
*   **Etiology/Agent:** Severe deficiency of **both Calories (Energy) and Protein**. "Balanced Starvation".
*   **Host:** Typically affects **infants (<1 year)**. Often due to early weaning or failure of breastfeeding.
*   **Pathogenesis:** Mobilization of fat and muscle for energy leading to severe wasting.

**Clinical Picture:**
*   **Wasting:** Extreme muscle wasting and loss of subcutaneous fat. "Skin and bones" appearance.
*   **Facies:** **Monkey Face** or "Old Man Face" (shriveled skin, sunken eyes).
*   **Mental Changes:** Child is usually **Alert** and irritable (hungry).
*   **Edema:** **Absent**.
*   **Appetite:** Voracious (good appetite), unlike the anorexia seen in Kwashiorkor.

### **Comparison: Kwashiorkor vs. Marasmus**

| Feature | **Kwashiorkor** | **Marasmus** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Deficiency** | Primarily Protein | Protein + Calories (Energy) |
| **Age Group** | 1 – 3 years (Toddlers) | < 1 year (Infants) |
| **Edema** | **Present** (Cardinal sign) | Absent |
| **Facies** | **Moon Face** (Bloated) | **Monkey/Old Man Face** (Shriveled) |
| **Mental State** | Apathetic, Dull, Lethargic | Alert, Irritable, Hungry |
| **Muscle Wasting** | Present (masked by edema) | **Severe** (Obvious) |
| **Subcutaneous Fat** | Reduced but present | **Absent** (Loose skin folds) |
| **Skin Changes** | Flaky Paint Dermatosis | Usually Normal |
| **Hair Changes** | Flag Sign (Discolored/Sparse) | Normal or slightly thin |
| **Liver** | Hepatomegaly (Fatty Liver) | Normal |
| **Serum Albumin** | Low (< 3 g/dL) | Normal or slightly low |
| **Prognosis** | High mortality if untreated | Better survival if fed |

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a stick figure for Marasmus showing visible ribs and baggy pants (loose skin). Draw a bloated figure for Kwashiorkor with edema legs and moon face.

### **Classification of PEM**

**1. Gomez Classification (Weight for Age):**
Used to assess current nutritional status but cannot distinguish between acute and chronic malnutrition.
*   **Normal:** > 90% of expected weight.
*   **Grade I (Mild):** 75 – 90%
*   **Grade II (Moderate):** 60 – 74%
*   **Grade III (Severe):** < 60%

**2. Waterlow’s Classification:**
Distinguishes between:
*   **Wasting (Acute Malnutrition):** Deficit in **Weight for Height**.
*   **Stunting (Chronic Malnutrition):** Deficit in **Height for Age**.

**3. Welcome Trust Classification:**
Used to differentiate clinical types based on **Weight for Age** and **Edema**.

| Weight for Age (%) | **Edema Present** | **Edema Absent** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **60 - 80%** | Kwashiorkor | Undernutrition |
| **< 60%** | Marasmic-Kwashiorkor | Marasmus |

**4. WHO Definition of Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM):**
*   **Weight for Height:** < -3 SD (Z-score)
*   **Visible Severe Wasting**
*   **Bilateral Pitting Edema**
*   **Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC):** < 11.5 cm (using **Shakir's Tape**).

### **Management and Prevention**

**Treatment of Severe PEM (SAM)**
Managed at [[Nutritional Rehabilitation Centres]] (NRCs). Follows 3 phases:
1.  **Stabilization Phase (Days 1-2):** Treat life-threatening complications.
    *   **Hypoglycemia:** 10% Glucose.
    *   **Hypothermia:** Keep warm (Kangaroo Mother Care).
    *   **Dehydration:** ReSoMal (Rehydration Solution for Malnutrition - low Sodium).
    *   **Infection:** Antibiotics.
    *   **Electrolytes:** Correct K+ and Mg2+.
    *   **Diet:** F-75 starter formula (75 kcal/100ml).
2.  **Transition Phase:** Introduction of F-100 diet.
3.  **Rehabilitation Phase (Weeks 2-6):** Catch-up growth. F-100 diet (100 kcal/100ml), sensory stimulation, play therapy.

**Mnemonics for Management (10 Steps):**
*   **"Sugar, Cold, Water, Shock, Bugs, Salts, Food, Vitamins, Teach, Bye"**
    1.  Treat/prevent Hypoglycemia (**Sugar**)
    2.  Treat/prevent Hypothermia (**Cold**)
    3.  Treat/prevent Dehydration (**Water**)
    4.  Correct Electrolyte Imbalance (**Salts**)
    5.  Treat/prevent Infection (**Bugs**)
    6.  Correct Micronutrient deficiencies (**Vitamins** - Vit A, Iron, Folic acid)
    7.  Start Cautious Feeding (**Food**)
    8.  Achieve Catch-up growth
    9.  Sensory Stimulation (**Teach**/Play)
    10. Prepare for discharge & follow-up (**Bye**).

**Prevention:**
*   **Health Promotion:** Promotion of [[Breastfeeding]] (exclusive for 6 months), proper weaning foods (complementary feeding), nutrition education, family planning.
*   **Specific Protection:** Immunization (Measles vaccine is crucial as measles precipitates PEM), Vitamin A prophylaxis, deworming.
*   **Early Diagnosis:** Using **Growth Charts** (Road to Health Chart) at Anganwadi centers (ICDS) to detect growth faltering early.
