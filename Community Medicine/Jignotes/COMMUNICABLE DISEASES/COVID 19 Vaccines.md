# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > COVID 19 Vaccines

# COVID-19 VACCINES

### **Overview**
Vaccination against [[SARS-CoV-2]] is the most effective public health intervention to control the pandemic. India launched one of the world’s largest vaccination drives on **January 16, 2021**. The vaccines aim to provide specific protection by inducing humoral and cellular immunity against the spike protein of the virus.

### **Classification of COVID-19 Vaccines**
Based on the technology used, the vaccines approved/used are classified as follows:

| **Type of Vaccine** | **Mechanism** | **Examples** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Viral Vector (Adenovirus)** | Uses a non-replicating virus to deliver genetic material coding for spike protein. | • [[Covishield]] (ChAdOx1)<br>• [[Sputnik V]]<br>• Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) |
| **Whole Virion Inactivated** | Uses killed coronavirus to elicit immune response. | • [[Covaxin]] (BBV-152)<br>• Sinovac/CoronaVac |
| **Protein Subunit** | Contains specific isolated proteins (e.g., Receptor Binding Domain). | • **Corbevax** (BECOV2D)<br>• **Novavax** |
| **mRNA Vaccine** | Messenger RNA codes for the spike protein. | • **Moderna** (mRNA-1273)<br>• **Pfizer-BioNTech** (BNT162b2) |
| **DNA Vaccine** | Plasmid DNA based. | • **ZyCoV-D** (Zydus Cadila) |
| **Intranasal** | Recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus vector. | • **INCOVACC** (BBV154) |

### **Newer & Other Approved Vaccines**

1.  **INCOVACC (BBV154):**
    *   **Type:** Intranasal, Recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus vectored vaccine.
    *   **Significance:** World's first approved [[nasal vaccine]] for COVID-19.
    *   **Schedule:** 2 doses, 4 weeks apart.
    *   **Producer:** Bharat Biotech.

2.  **Corbevax:**
    *   **Type:** Protein Subunit (Recombinant RBD).
    *   **Indication:** Approved for children 12–14 years.
    *   **Dose:** 0.5 ml IM, 2 doses (>4 weeks gap).

3.  **ZyCoV-D:**
    *   **Type:** DNA-based vaccine (Plasmid DNA).
    *   **Significance:** First DNA vaccine for humans.

4.  **mRNA Vaccines (Pfizer & Moderna):**
    *   **Efficacy:** High (~94-95%).
    *   **Storage:** Pfizer requires ultra-cold chain (**-70°C**); Moderna requires **-25°C to -15°C**.

### **Operational Guidelines**

*   **[[Co-WIN]] Platform:** Digital platform for registration, appointment scheduling, and certification.
*   **Registration:** Mandatory via Photo ID (Aadhar, PAN, Voter ID, Passport, etc.).
*   **Interchangeability:** Vaccines are **NOT** interchangeable. The entire schedule must be completed with the same vaccine type.
*   **Gap with other vaccines:** Generally, a gap of **14 days** (or 2-4 weeks) is recommended between COVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines.

---

### **Indications and Contraindications**

#### **Eligible Populations**
*   All individuals above the approved age (12+ or 18+ depending on vaccine).
*   **Pregnancy:** Can be administered at any time during pregnancy; benefits outweigh risks.
*   **Lactation:** Recommended for all lactating mothers.
*   **History of COVID:** Can take vaccine, but defer for **3 months (approx 14 days after symptom resolution)** following recovery.
*   **Comorbidities:** Persons with cardiac, renal, pulmonary, or metabolic comorbidities are prioritized.

#### **Defer Vaccination (Temporary Contraindication)**
*   Active symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
*   Patients who received **monoclonal antibodies** or convalescent plasma.
*   Acutely unwell/hospitalized patients.

#### **Absolute Contraindications**
*   History of **anaphylaxis/severe allergic reaction** to a previous dose of the vaccine.
*   Immediate or delayed-onset anaphylaxis to vaccine ingredients (e.g., Polysorbate).

### **Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI)**

*   **Common (Mild):** Injection site pain, tenderness, headache, fatigue, myalgia, pyrexia, chills, nausea.
*   **Rare (Serious):**
    *   **Covishield:** Very rare events of demyelinating disorders have been reported (causal link not fully established).
    *   **mRNA vaccines:** Rare risk of myocarditis/pericarditis (especially in young males).

### **Clinical Relevance**
> **Clinical Tip:** The **[[Covishield]]** vaccine is based on the ChAdOx1 platform. It is crucial to remember the dosing interval was extended to **12-16 weeks** in India to maximize efficacy based on real-world data.
>
> **Important:** **[[Covaxin]]** contains the whole virion; therefore, it theoretically exposes the immune system to multiple viral antigens, not just the spike protein. It uses **Algel-IMDG** (Chemosorbed) as an adjuvant.
