# [[General Toxicology]] > Diagnosis of Poisoning in Living and Dead

### Diagnosis of Poisoning

Diagnosis of poisoning can be challenging as symptoms often mimic natural diseases. It relies on a combination of history, clinical examination (living), autopsy findings (dead), and chemical analysis.

---

### I. Diagnosis in the Living

The diagnosis in a living patient is based on four pillars: History, Clinical signs (Toxidromes), Specific physical clues, and Laboratory investigations.

#### 1. History
Suspicion of poisoning should arise if:
*   **Onset:** Symptoms appear **suddenly** in a person who was previously healthy.
*   **Timing:** Symptoms appear shortly after intake of food, drink, or medicine.
*   **Uniformity:** Multiple persons eating the same food develop similar symptoms simultaneously (e.g., [[Food Poisoning]]).
*   **Progression:** Symptoms worsen rapidly (acute poisoning) or follow a specific course.
*   **Environment:** Access to chemicals (agricultural workers), empty containers found near the patient, or history of depression/suicidal intent.

#### 2. Clinical Features (Toxidromes)
A constellation of signs and symptoms suggesting a specific class of poison is called a [[Toxidrome]].

| Toxidrome | Causative Agents | Clinical Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cholinergic** | [[Organophosphates]], Carbamates, Physostigmine | **DUMBELS**: **D**iarrhea, **U**rination, **M**iosis (Pinpoint pupils), **B**radycardia, **E**mesis, **L**acrimation, **S**alivation/Sweating. |
| **Anticholinergic** | [[Datura]], Atropine, Antihistamines, TCAs | **Blind as a bat** (Mydriasis), **Mad as a hatter** (Delirium), **Red as a beet** (Flushing), **Hot as a hare** (Hyperthermia), **Dry as a bone** (Dry mouth/skin). |
| **Opioid** | [[Morphine]], Heroin, Codeine | **Triad**: 1. Coma, 2. Pinpoint pupils (Miosis), 3. Respiratory depression. |
| **Sympathomimetic** | [[Cocaine]], Amphetamines | Agitation, Mydriasis, Tachycardia, Hypertension, Hyperthermia, Sweating. |
| **Sedative-Hypnotic** | [[Barbiturates]], Benzodiazepines, Ethanol | CNS depression, Ataxia, Slurred speech, Coma, Respiratory depression. |

#### 3. Specific Physical Clues
Certain poisons leave characteristic signs on the body.

**A. Smell/Odour (Breath or Vomitus)**
*Useful Mnemonic: **GAP** (Garlic = Arsenic, Phosphorus)*

| Odour | Poison |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Garlic-like** | [[Arsenic]], [[Phosphorus]], [[Organophosphates]], Aluminium Phosphide, Thallium |
| **Bitter Almonds** | [[Cyanide]] |
| **Fruity** | Ethanol, Chloroform, Acetone (DKA) |
| **Burnt Rope** | [[Cannabis]] |
| **Rotten Eggs** | [[Hydrogen Sulphide]] |
| **Shoe Polish** | Nitrobenzene |
| **Acrid/Pungent** | Chloral hydrate, Paraldehyde |
| **Kerosene** | Petroleum distillates, Organophosphates (due to aromax solvent) |

**B. Pupillary Changes**
*   **Pinpoint (Miosis):** Opioids, Organophosphates, Carbamates, Phenol, Pontine hemorrhage.
*   **Dilated (Mydriasis):** Datura/Atropine, Cocaine, Amphetamines, Cyanide, Alcohol (some stages).

**C. Skin and Mucosal Findings**
*   **Cherry Red Skin:** [[Carbon Monoxide]] (CO).
*   **Cyanosis:** Opioids, Nitrites, Aniline.
*   **Jaundice:** Phosphorus, Carbon tetrachloride, Amanita phalloides.
*   **Needle Tracks/Marks:** Intravenous drug abuse (Heroin, Cocaine).
*   **Corrosion/Stains:**
    *   *Black:* Sulfuric acid.
    *   *Yellow:* Nitric acid.
    *   *Bleached/White:* Phenol (Carbolic acid).
*   **Hyperkeratosis/Raindrop Pigmentation:** Chronic [[Arsenic]] poisoning.
*   **Burtonian Line:** Blue line on gums (Lead poisoning).

#### 4. Laboratory Investigations
*   **Blood:** Identification of specific poison (Gold standard).
*   **Urine:** Best for screening many drugs (metabolites are concentrated).
*   **Gastric Aspirate:** Analysis of unabsorbed poison.
*   **Specific Tests:**
    *   *Cholinesterase levels:* Organophosphates.
    *   *Carboxyhemoglobin levels:* CO poisoning.
    *   *Acid-base status:* Anion gap metabolic acidosis (Methanol, Ethylene glycol).

### II. Diagnosis in the Dead (Postmortem)

In fatal cases, the diagnosis rests on the combination of autopsy findings and chemical analysis.

#### 1. Postmortem Examination
[[Medicolegal Autopsy]] must be thorough and complete.

**A. External Findings**
*   **Smell:** Cranial cavity should be opened *first* to detect volatile odors (e.g., Cyanide, Alcohol) before they are masked by the smell of the GI tract contents.
*   **Postmortem Staining (Hypostasis):** Unusual colors provide diagnostic clues.

| Colour of Lividity | Poison |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cherry Red** | Carbon Monoxide (Carboxyhemoglobin) |
| **Brick Red / Bright Red** | Cyanide |
| **Chocolate Brown** | Nitrites, Aniline, Chlorates (Methemoglobinemia) |
| **Dark Brown / Yellow** | Phosphorus |
| **Blue/Green** | Hydrogen Sulfide |

*   **Injection Marks:** Examine antecubital fossae, webbing of fingers, back of hands, or concealed areas (under tongue, scrotum) for drug abuse.
*   **Rigor Mortis:** Early onset and disappearance in Strychnine (due to convulsions) and Dinitrocresol.
*   **Decomposition:** Retarded in [[Arsenic]] and Organophosphate poisoning; Accelerated in H2S.

**B. Internal Findings**
*   **GI Tract:**
    *   *Corrosion/Softening:* Acids and Alkalis.
    *   *Hyperemia/Velvety appearance:* Arsenic (Red velvet stomach).
    *   *Hemorrhagic gastritis:* Phosphorus, Aspirin.
    *   *Foreign material:* Capsules, tablets, plant seeds (e.g., Datura seeds, Abrus, Castor beans), soot (in trachea/stomach for fire deaths).
*   **Respiratory System:**
    *   *Pulmonary Edema/Froth:* Opioids, Organophosphates.
    *   *Soot in airway:* Thermal burns/smoke inhalation.
*   **Liver:**
    *   *Fatty Change:* Phosphorus, Alcohol, Chloroform.
    *   *Necrosis:* Paracetamol, Carbon tetrachloride.
*   **Kidneys:**
    *   *Tubular Necrosis:* Mercury, Oxalic acid (Oxalate crystals), Ethylene glycol.
*   **Heart:**
    *   *Subendocardial Hemorrhages:* **Arsenic** (characteristic finding).

#### 2. Chemical Analysis (Viscera Preservation)
This is the confirmatory proof of poisoning. The routine viscera to be preserved in India are:

1.  **Stomach:** Whole stomach with contents (opened and examined).
2.  **Intestine:** Upper 30 cm of small intestine with contents.
3.  **Liver:** 500 gm (or whole in children).
4.  **Kidney:** Half of each kidney (or whole in children).
5.  **Blood:** 10–30 ml (Peripheral blood, e.g., femoral vein).
6.  **Urine:** 30–50 ml (if available).
7.  **Preservative:** **Saturated Solution of Common Salt (NaCl)** is standard.
    *   *Exceptions:* For acids, use Rectified Spirit. For Alcohol/Phosphorus/Acetic Acid poisoning, use Saturated Saline (Spirit gives false positives or dissolves the poison).

#### 3. Failure to Detect Poison
Chemical analysis may be negative even in true poisoning cases due to:
*   Elimination of poison by vomiting/diarrhea or metabolism before death.
*   Use of wrong preservative or insufficient sample size.
*   Biological poisons (venoms, bacterial toxins) which decompose or are not detectable by routine chemical tests.
*   Volatile poisons evaporating due to improper sealing.
*   Poison administered by inhalation or injection (may not be in stomach/liver).

### Medicolegal Aspects and Duties of Doctor

1.  **Medical Duty:** The primary duty is to **save the life** of the patient (Stabilization > Decontamination > Antidote).
2.  **Legal Duty (In Living):**
    *   **Inform Police:** Under **Section 39 CrPC**, every person (including doctors) is bound to give information regarding offenses (like homicidal poisoning). Failure to do so is punishable under **Section 176 IPC** (omission to give notice) or **Section 202 IPC** (intentional omission).
    *   **Preserve Evidence:** Collect gastric lavage (first sample), vomitus, urine, and soiled clothes. Seal and hand over to the police. Failure to preserve evidence is punishable under **Section 201 IPC** (causing disappearance of evidence).
    *   **Dying Declaration:** If the patient is critical, arrange for a dying declaration (Magistrate or Doctor can record if imminent danger).
3.  **Legal Duty (In Dead):**
    *   Do **not** issue a death certificate if poisoning is suspected.
    *   Inform police immediately (Medicolegal Case - MLC).
    *   Body is sent for Medicolegal Autopsy.
