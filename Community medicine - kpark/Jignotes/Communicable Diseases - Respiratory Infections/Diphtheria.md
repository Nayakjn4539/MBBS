# [[Communicable Diseases - Respiratory Infections]] > Diphtheria

### **DIPHTHERIA**

Diphtheria is an acute infectious disease caused by the toxigenic strains of **[[Corynebacterium diphtheriae]]**. It is characterized by the formation of a greyish-yellow false membrane (**[[Pseudo-membrane]]**) over the tonsils, pharynx, or larynx.

---

### **1. Epidemiological Determinants**

#### **A. Agent Factors**
*   **Causative Agent:** **[[Corynebacterium diphtheriae]]**.
    *   It is a Gram-positive, non-motile, club-shaped organism.
    *   **Biotypes:** Four types exist—*gravis* (most severe), *mitis*, *belfanti*, and *intermedius*.
*   **Toxin:** The bacteria produces a powerful **[[Exotoxin]]**.
    *   *Note:* Non-toxigenic strains can become toxigenic if infected by a specific bacteriophage (**[[Beta-phage]]**).
*   **Source of Infection:**
    *   **Cases:** Range from subclinical to frank clinical cases.
    *   **Carriers:** Carriers are the **most common source** of infection.
        *   **Nasal carriers** are more dangerous than throat carriers due to frequent shedding.
        *   Types: Temporary (incubatory/convalescent) or Chronic.
*   **Infective Material:** Nasopharyngeal secretions, discharge from skin lesions, and contaminated fomites.
*   **Period of Infectivity:**
    *   **Cases:** 14–28 days from onset.
    *   **Carriers:** Can remain infective for months if untreated.
    *   *Criteria for non-infectivity:* Two consecutive negative throat/nose swabs taken 24 hours apart.

#### **B. Host Factors**
*   **Age:** Primarily affects children aged **1 to 5 years**. In countries with good immunization coverage, the age incidence shifts to older children and adults.
*   **Immunity:**
    *   Infants born to immune mothers are protected for the first few weeks/months.
    *   **[[Herd immunity]]** of over **70%** is required to prevent epidemic spread.
    *   **[[Schick Test]]**: An intradermal test used to determine immunity status or susceptibility to diphtheria.

#### **C. Environmental Factors**
*   **Season:** More common in winter months.
*   **Social Factors:** Overcrowding, poor housing, and lack of personal hygiene favor spread.

### **2. Mode of Transmission**
1.  **[[Droplet Infection]]**: Most common route (coughing, sneezing).
2.  **Cutaneous lesions:** Direct contact with infected wounds/ulcers.
3.  **Fomites:** Contaminated cups, toys, pencils (rare).
4.  **Portal of Entry:** Respiratory tract (common), skin (cuts/wounds), eye, or genitalia.

---

### **3. Incubation Period**
*   **[[2 to 6 days]]** (occasionally longer).

---

### **4. Clinical Features**
The disease is classified based on the site of infection:

1.  **Pharyngotonsillar (Faucial) Diphtheria:**
    *   Sore throat, difficulty swallowing, low-grade fever.
    *   **[[Pseudo-membrane]]**: A greyish-yellow or bluish-white membrane forms on tonsils/pharynx. It is adherent; attempts to remove it cause **bleeding**.
    *   **[[Bull Neck]]**: Marked edema of cervical lymph nodes and neck giving a "bull-neck" appearance in severe toxic cases.
2.  **Laryngotracheal Diphtheria:**
    *   Hoarseness, croupy cough.
    *   Obstruction by membrane can lead to **suffocation/asphyxia**.
3.  **Nasal Diphtheria:**
    *   Mildest form. Presents with blood-stained nasal discharge.
4.  **Cutaneous Diphtheria:**
    *   Ulcers covered with a membrane; common in tropical areas.

**Complications:**
*   **Cardiac:** Myocarditis (toxin damage to heart muscle).
*   **Neurological:** Paralysis of the soft palate (nasal voice, regurgitation of fluids), eye muscles, or limbs.
*   **Renal:** Toxic damage to kidneys.

### **5. Diagnosis**
*   **Clinical Diagnosis:** Treatment should start **immediately** on clinical suspicion without waiting for lab confirmation.
*   **Laboratory Diagnosis:**
    *   **Culture:** Loeffler’s serum slope or Tellurite blood agar (black colonies).
    *   **Staining:** Albert's stain shows metachromatic granules (Chinese letter pattern).
    *   **PCR:** To detect the toxin gene.

---

### **6. Treatment**
#### **A. For Cases**
1.  **Neutralization of Toxin (Specific Treatment):**
    *   **[[Diphtheria Antitoxin]] (ADS):** Given immediately (IM or IV).
    *   **Dose:** Ranges from **20,000 to 100,000 units** depending on severity and duration.
    *   *Precaution:* Always perform a sensitivity test (conjunctival or intradermal) before administration to rule out anaphylaxis to horse serum.
2.  **Antibiotics:**
    *   **[[Penicillin]]** (Procaine penicillin 600,000 units IM daily) OR
    *   **[[Erythromycin]]** (oral) for **14 days**.
    *   *Purpose:* Stops further toxin production and eliminates the carrier state.
3.  **Isolation:** Patient should be isolated until **two consecutive throat swabs** taken 24 hours apart are negative.

#### **B. For Carriers**
*   Oral **Erythromycin** for 10 days is the treatment of choice.

### **7. Prevention and Control**

#### **A. Active Immunization (Vaccination)**
Included in the **[[National Immunization Schedule]]** (Universal Immunization Programme - UIP).

*   **Vaccine Type:** Toxoid (Formalin-inactivated toxin).
*   **Preparations:**
    *   **[[Pentavalent Vaccine]]**: Contains Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus, Hep B, and Hib.
    *   **[[DPT Vaccine]]**: Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus (contains aluminum phosphate as adjuvant).
*   **Schedule (India):**
    *   **Primary:** 3 doses at **6 weeks, 10 weeks, and 14 weeks** (Pentavalent).
    *   **Boosters:**
        *   1st Booster: **16–24 months** (DPT).
        *   2nd Booster: **5–6 years** (DPT).
*   **Route/Dose:** 0.5 ml, Intramuscular (IM), Anterolateral thigh.

#### **B. Management of Contacts**
1.  **Previously Immunized (< 2 years ago):** No action needed.
2.  **Previously Immunized (> 2 years ago):** Give a **Booster dose** of Diphtheria toxoid.
3.  **Non-immunized:**
    *   Prophylactic Antibiotics (**Erythromycin** or Penicillin).
    *   **[[Diphtheria Antitoxin]]** (1000-2000 units).
    *   Active immunization (Vaccine) started immediately.
    *   Daily surveillance.
