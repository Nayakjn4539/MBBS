# Open Globe Injury (Penetrating/Perforating)

[[Open-globe injury]] is defined as a full-thickness wound of the **eyewall** ([[cornea]] or [[sclera]] or both). It is a sight-threatening emergency requiring immediate evaluation and management.

### Ocular Trauma Terminology (BETT Classification)
The **Birmingham Eye Trauma Terminology (BETT)** system classifies mechanical ocular injuries as follows:

| Terminology | Definition | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Closed-globe injury]]** | Eyewall is intact (no full-thickness wound). | Contusion or lamellar laceration. |
| **[[Open-globe injury]]** | Full-thickness wound of the eyewall. | Rupture or Laceration. |
| **[[Rupture]]** | Full-thickness wound caused by **blunt object**. | **Inside-out** mechanism due to momentary rise in [[intraocular pressure]]. |
| **[[Laceration]]** | Full-thickness wound caused by **sharp object**. | **Outside-in** mechanism at impact site. |
| **[[Penetrating injury]]** | Single full-thickness wound (One entry point). | Sharp object traverses coats only once. |
| **[[Perforating injury]]** | Two full-thickness wounds (**Entry and Exit**). | Sharp object/missile passes through the globe. |
| **[[Intraocular Foreign Body]] (IOFB)** | Retained foreign object inside the eye. | Technically a penetrating injury but grouped separately due to specific implications. |

### Etiology and Modes of Injury
1.  **Sharp/Pointed Instruments:** Needles, knives, nails, arrows, screwdrivers, glass pieces, pens, pencils.
2.  **High-velocity Missiles:** Bullet injuries, iron particles in lathe workers/industrial accidents.
3.  **Blunt Trauma (Rupture):** Direct blow (fist, ball) causing indirect rupture at the weakest point of the eyewall (usually superonasal limbus).

---

### Clinical Features and Signs
The presentation depends on the severity and mechanism of injury.

#### 1. Symptoms
*   Sudden loss of vision.
*   Pain and photophobia.
*   History of trauma with sharp object or projectile.

#### 2. Signs
*   **Hypotony:** Low [[intraocular pressure]] is a crucial sign (unless raised initially in rupture).
*   **[[Seidel's test]]:** Positive (leakage of aqueous humor detected with fluorescein staining).
*   **Corneal/Scleral Signs:**
    *   Full-thickness wound (corneal or scleral tear).
    *   **[[Iris prolapse]]:** Uveal tissue protruding through the wound.
*   **Anterior Chamber:**
    *   Flat or shallow [[anterior chamber]].
    *   **[[Hyphema]]** (blood in AC).
    *   Traumatic [[cataract]] or lens capsule rupture.
*   **Posterior Segment:**
    *   **[[Vitreous loss]]** or hemorrhage.
    *   **[[Retinal detachment]]** or tear.
    *   Commotio retinae ([[Berlin's edema]]).
    *   Choroidal rupture.

**Clinical Implication:** In cases of globe rupture, the intraocular pressure may be raised initially due to compression but ultimately decreases.

### Mechanism of Damage
Damage occurs through the following modes:
1.  **Mechanical effects:** Direct disruption of tissue (cornea, iris, lens, retina).
2.  **Introduction of Infection:** Entry of pyogenic organisms leading to [[purulent iridocyclitis]], [[endophthalmitis]], or [[panophthalmitis]].
3.  **Post-traumatic Iridocyclitis:** Frequent occurrence that can cause devastating damage.
4.  **[[Sympathetic ophthalmitis]]:** Inflammation of the non-injured eye.

### Management of Open Globe Injuries

The primary goal is to restore the integrity of the globe and prevent infection.

#### A. Immediate Measures (Pre-hospital/Emergency Room)
*   **Do not press on the eye.** Avoid eye manipulation.
*   Apply a rigid **eye shield** to protect the globe.
*   **Systemic Antibiotics:** Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics (e.g., Cefazolin, Vancomycin, Ceftazidime) to prevent endophthalmitis.
*   **Tetanus prophylaxis:** Injection Tetanus Toxoid (TT).
*   **Nil Per Os (NPO):** Prepare patient for surgery under General Anesthesia (GA).
*   **Analgesics:** For pain control.

#### B. Surgical Management
Surgery is performed under general anesthesia.

**1. Repair of [[Corneal wound]]**
*   **Uncomplicated small central wound (<2mm):** May seal spontaneously. Treated with pad and bandage, [[atropine]], and antibiotic ointments.
*   **Large wound (>2mm):** Requires microsurgical suturing (10-0 monofilament nylon).
*   **Complicated wound (with Iris Prolapse):**
    *   **Abscission:** If the prolapsed iris is old or potentially infected, it should be excised (abscised) to prevent introducing infection.
    *   **Reposition:** Fresh, clean prolapse may be carefully reposited (though standard texts warn against repositioning if infection risk exists).
    *   Wound is sutured meticulously.

**2. Repair of [[Scleral wound]]**
*   Usually associated with corneal wounds.
*   Exploration of the extent of the wound is necessary.
*   Sutured with non-absorbable sutures (e.g., 8-0/9-0 nylon or vicryl).
*   In corneo-scleral tears, the **first suture** is applied at the **limbus** to align the anatomy.

**3. Management of Associated Injuries**
*   **Lens:** If the lens is ruptured causing inflammation or blocking the visual axis, lensectomy is performed.
*   **Vitreous:** Anterior [[vitrectomy]] is done if vitreous prolapse is present at the wound site.
*   **Severely Damaged Eye:** If there is extensive disorganization (corneo-scleral tears, uveal prolapse, retinal loss) with no chance of useful vision, primary [[enucleation]] may be considered to prevent sympathetic ophthalmitis.

#### C. Post-operative Treatment
*   **Topical:** Antibiotics, Cycloplegics ([[Atropine]]), and Steroids.
*   **Systemic:** Antibiotics and Anti-inflammatory drugs.

### Intraocular Foreign Body (IOFB)
Technically a penetrating injury with a retained object.
*   **Types:** Iron/Steel (90%), glass, stone, lead, copper, wood.
*   **Pathology:**
    *   **Inert:** Glass, gold, silver (may be left if not causing damage).
    *   **Toxic:** Iron causes [[Siderosis bulbi]] (epithelial toxicity). Copper causes [[Chalcosis]] (suppurative reaction or sunflower cataract).
    *   **Inorganic/Organic:** Wood/vegetable matter carries high infection risk.
*   **Diagnosis:** X-ray, CT Scan (Gold standard), USG (B-scan). **MRI is contraindicated** if metallic foreign body is suspected.
*   **Treatment:** Removal via electromagnet (if magnetic) or Vitrectomy with forceps.

### Complications
1.  **Infectious:**
    *   **[[Endophthalmitis]]:** Inflammation of inner structures.
    *   **[[Panophthalmitis]]:** Inflammation involving all coats including Tenon's capsule.
2.  **Inflammatory:**
    *   **[[Sympathetic Ophthalmitis]]:** Bilateral granulomatous panuveitis following penetrating trauma to one eye (exciting eye). Occurs 2 weeks to 3 months post-injury.
3.  **Structural:**
    *   Traumatic [[Cataract]] (Rosette shaped).
    *   Secondary [[Glaucoma]] (Angle recession, Ghost cell).
    *   Retinal Detachment (Rhegmatogenous/Tractional).
    *   [[Phthisis bulbi]] (Shrinkage and disorganization of the globe).
