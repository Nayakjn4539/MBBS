# [[CONCEPT OF HEALTH & DISEASES]] > Define Health. Enumerate the various indicators of Health. What is Health for All

### **I. Definition of Health**

The most widely accepted definition was provided by the **World Health Organization (WHO)** in the preamble to its constitution (1948):

> **"Health is a state of complete [[physical, mental and social well-being]] and not merely an absence of disease or infirmity."**,

**Recent Amplification:**
In recent years, this definition has been amplified to include: **"an ability to lead a [[socially and economically productive life]]."**,

**Operational Definition:**
Since the WHO definition is considered idealistic, for measurement purposes, health is often viewed operationally as a condition where there is no obvious evidence of disease and the person functions normally within accepted standards of their age, sex, and community.

**Dimensions of Health:**
Health is multidimensional. The core dimensions envisaged by WHO are:
1.  **Physical:** Perfect functioning of body cells and organs.
2.  **Mental:** A state of balance between the individual and the surrounding world.
3.  **Social:** Quantity and quality of interpersonal ties and community involvement.
*(Additional dimensions include Spiritual, Emotional, and Vocational)*

### **II. Indicators of Health**

Health indicators are variables used to measure the health status of a community, compare health status between countries, and evaluate health services.,

**Mnemonic for Indicators:**
**"M**y **M**om **D**oes **N**ot **H**ave **U**mbrella, **S**o **S**he **E**nvies **H**er **Q**ueen"
*(**M**ortality, **M**orbidity, **D**isability, **N**utritional, **H**ealth care, **U**tilization, **S**ocial/Mental, **S**ocio-economic, **E**nvironmental, **H**ealth policy, **Q**uality of Life)*

#### **1. Mortality Indicators**
These measure the rate of death in a population.
*   **[[Crude Death Rate]]**: Deaths per 1000 population.
*   **[[Expectation of Life]]**: A positive health indicator. It estimates the average number of years a person is expected to live.
*   **[[Infant Mortality Rate]] (IMR)**: Considered the most sensitive indicator of a community's health status and socio-economic development.,
*   **Child Mortality Rate**: Deaths of children aged 1-4 years.
*   **Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)**.
*   **Disease-specific mortality rates**.

#### **2. Morbidity Indicators**
These measure the burden of ill-health (sickness) in a community.
*   **[[Incidence]]**: Number of *new* cases.
*   **[[Prevalence]]**: Number of *all* current cases (old + new).
*   **Notification rates**.
*   **Attendance rates** at outpatient departments (OPD).
*   **Duration of stay** in hospital.

#### **3. Disability Indicators**
Used to supplement mortality data, focusing on the quality of life and functional limitations.
*   **[[Sullivan’s Index]]**: Life expectancy *minus* duration of disability (Disability-free life expectancy).,
*   **[[DALY]] (Disability Adjusted Life Years)**: Measures the burden of disease. One DALY = One year of healthy life lost.,
*   **[[HALE]] (Health Adjusted Life Expectancy)**: Years of life expected to be lived in full health.

#### **4. Nutritional Status Indicators**
*   Anthropometric measurements of preschool children (e.g., Weight for age).
*   Prevalence of **[[Low Birth Weight]]** (less than 2.5 kg).

#### **5. Health Care Delivery Indicators**
These reflect the equity of distribution of health resources.
*   **Doctor-population ratio**.
*   **Doctor-nurse ratio**.
*   **Population-bed ratio**.

#### **6. Utilization Rates**
Measures the extent to which people actually use the health services provided.
*   **Immunization coverage** (e.g., % of fully immunized infants).
*   **Antenatal care coverage** (% of pregnant women receiving care).
*   **Bed occupancy rate**.

#### **7. Indicators of Social and Mental Health**
Indirect measures of social pathology.
*   Rates of **[[suicide]]**, homicide, and road traffic accidents.
*   Alcohol and drug abuse rates.

#### **8. Environmental Indicators**
Reflect the quality of the physical environment.
*   Proportion of population with access to **[[safe water]]**.
*   Proportion of population with access to adequate **sanitation**.
*   Pollution indices (Air/Water).

#### **9. Socio-economic Indicators**
These do not directly measure health but are crucial for interpretation.
*   **Per capita GNP**.
*   **Literacy rates** (especially female literacy).
*   **Dependency ratio**.

#### **10. Health Policy Indicators**
Reflect political commitment.
*   Proportion of **GNP spent on health services**.

#### **11. Indicators of Quality of Life**
*   **[[PQLI]] (Physical Quality of Life Index)**: A composite index ranging from 0-100, consolidating three indicators:
    1.  Infant Mortality Rate.
    2.  Life Expectancy at age one.
    3.  Literacy.
*   **[[HDI]] (Human Development Index)**: Ranges from 0 to 1. Combines:
    1.  Longevity (Life expectancy at birth).
    2.  Knowledge (Mean and expected years of schooling).
    3.  Income (GNI per capita).,

### **III. Health for All**

The concept of "Health for All" (HFA) was adopted by the 30th World Health Assembly in 1977.

**Definition:**
It is defined as: **"The attainment by all citizens of the world by the year 2000 of a level of health that will permit them to lead a [[socially and economically productive life]]."**,,

**Key Characteristics:**
*   **Equity:** The fundamental principle is equity—reducing the gap in health status between developed and developing countries, and between rich and poor within countries.
*   **Access:** It implies that essential health care should be accessible to all individuals and families in an acceptable and affordable way.
*   **Holistic Approach:** It is not just about medical care; it involves removing obstacles to health such as malnutrition, ignorance, contaminated water, and unhygienic housing.
*   **Vehicle:** The **[[Primary Health Care]]** (PHC) approach was identified at the Alma-Ata Conference (1978) as the key to achieving Health for All.
