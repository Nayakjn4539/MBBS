# [[Affections Of Soft Tissues]] > Ganglion Cyst

### Ganglion Cyst

**Definition**
A [[Ganglion cyst]] is the most common benign, cystic swelling that arises from the [[joint capsule]] or a [[tendon sheath]]. It is formed by **cystic degeneration** (myxoid degeneration) of the fibrous tissue.

**Etiology and Pathogenesis**
*   **Origin:** It usually arises from the [[synovial lining]] of a joint or tendon sheath.
*   **Mechanism:** The widely accepted theory is **myxoid degeneration** of collagen/fibrous tissue found in the capsule or tendon sheath.
*   **Nature:** It is a **pseudocyst** because it does not have a true [[epithelial lining]]. It is lined by compressed connective tissue.

**Pathology**
*   **Gross Appearance:** A unilocular or multilocular cyst with a smooth, white/translucent wall.
*   **Contents:** It contains a clear, glairy, gelatinous, or mucinous fluid which is highly viscous (rich in [[hyaluronic acid]]).
*   **Connection:** It often has a pedicle or stalk connecting it to the underlying joint capsule or tendon sheath.

**Common Sites**
1.  **Dorsum of the wrist** (Most common site): Usually originates from the [[scapholunate ligament]].
2.  **Volar aspect of the wrist**: Between the [[radial artery]] and [[flexor carpi radialis]] tendon.
3.  **Flexor tendon sheath** of fingers (Volar retinacular ganglion).
4.  **Dorsum of the foot**.

**Clinical Features**
*   **Demographics:** Common in young adults (20–40 years); slightly more common in females.
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Swelling:** A painless lump that may fluctuate in size.
    *   **Pain:** Usually painless, but may cause a dull ache or discomfort, especially with extreme wrist movements.
    *   **Weakness:** Rare, but slight weakness of the grip may occur.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Inspection:** Well-defined, smooth, localized swelling.
    *   **Palpation:**
        *   Consistency varies from cystic (soft) to firm/hard (tense cyst).
        *   Non-tender.
        *   May be slightly mobile but usually fixed to deep structures.
    *   **Transillumination:** **Positive** (The cyst glows when a torch is placed against it).

**Clinical Implications:**
*   **"Bible Cyst":** Historically, ganglions were treated by smashing them with a heavy book (like a Bible) to rupture the cyst wall. This is **not recommended** today due to trauma and high recurrence.
*   **Differential Diagnosis:** A firm ganglion on the volar wrist must be differentiated from an [[aneurysm]] of the radial artery. *Always check for pulsation before sticking a needle in!*

**Investigations**
*   **Clinical Diagnosis:** Usually sufficient based on history, location, and transillumination.
*   **X-rays:** Usually normal; done to rule out underlying bony pathology (e.g., [[osteoarthritis]] or [[carpal bossing]]).
*   **MRI/Ultrasound:** Useful if the diagnosis is in doubt or to delineate the stalk before surgery.

**Treatment**
**1. Conservative Management**
*   **Reassurance:** Many ganglions (up to 50%) disappear spontaneously. If asymptomatic, no treatment is needed.
*   **Aspiration:** Aspiration of the gelatinous fluid using a wide-bore needle, often followed by injection of a [[corticosteroid]] (e.g., [[triamcinolone]]) and a sclerosant.
    *   *Note:* High recurrence rate with aspiration.

**2. Surgical Management**
*   **Indication:** Pain, cosmetic concern, nerve compression, or failure of conservative therapy.
*   **Procedure:** **Surgical Excision**.
    *   Requires meticulous dissection.
    *   Crucial to identify and remove the **stalk/pedicle** and a small portion of the joint capsule/tendon sheath base to prevent recurrence.
    *   Surgery is often done under a tourniquet to ensure a bloodless field.

**Complications**
*   **Recurrence:** The most common complication (approx. 30% even after excision).
*   **Infection:** Post-aspiration or post-surgical.
*   **Nerve Injury:** Superficial branch of the [[radial nerve]] (dorsal cysts) or palmar cutaneous branch of the [[median nerve]] (volar cysts).
*   **Stiffness:** Of the wrist joint post-surgery.

### Special Entity: Compound Palmar Ganglion

**Definition**
A chronic inflammation of the **ulnar bursa** (common flexor sheath) involving the flexor tendons at the wrist. It is not a true ganglion cyst in the traditional sense but rather a tubercular or rheumatoid tenosynovitis.

**Etiology**
*   **Tuberculosis** (Classic cause).
*   **Rheumatoid Arthritis**.

**Clinical Features**
*   **Swelling:** Hour-glass shaped swelling. It appears above and below the [[flexor retinaculum]].
*   **Cross-Fluctuation:** Pressing the swelling in the palm increases the swelling in the forearm and vice versa.
*   **Melon Seed Bodies:** The fluid inside may contain fibrin bodies resembling boiled sago or melon seeds.

**Treatment**
*   **Anti-tubercular chemotherapy** (if TB origin).
*   **Surgical excision** of the thickened synovial sheath.
