# Intraocular Lens Implantation: Instrumentation and Procedure

## Overview of Intraocular Lens (IOL)
An [[Intraocular Lens]] (IOL) is a synthetic artificial lens implanted to replace the natural crystalline lens, usually following [[Cataract Surgery]].

### Types of IOLs
*   **Based on Location:**
    *   **[[Posterior Chamber IOL]] (PCIOL):** Implanted in the capsular bag (ideal) or ciliary sulcus.
    *   **[[Anterior Chamber IOL]] (ACIOL):** Supported by the angle of the anterior chamber; used when capsular support is deficient.
    *   **Iris-supported lenses:** Fixed on the iris (e.g., Iris claw lens).
*   **Based on Material:**
    *   **Rigid:** [[Polymethyl Methacrylate]] (PMMA). Requires larger incision.
    *   **Foldable:** Acrylic (hydrophobic/hydrophilic), Silicone, Collamer. Can be inserted through small incisions (2.8–3.2 mm),.
    *   **Rollable:** Ultra-thin hydrogel lenses for micro-incisions (<2 mm).

## Surgical Instruments

### 1. Eye Speculums
Used to keep the eyelids apart during intraocular and extraocular surgeries.

| Type | Description | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Universal Metallic Eye Speculum** | Has two limbs and a spring mechanism with a screw to adjust limbs. | Can be used for both right and left eyes. Blades are open. |
| **Guarded Speculum** | Solid blades attached to the limbs. | Covers lid margins and keeps [[Eyelashes]] away from the surgical field. |
| **Wire Speculum** | Simple wire construction (Barraquer style). | Very light; causes minimal pressure on the [[Eyeball]]. |

**Clinical Implication:** Proper exposure is critical. Excessive pressure from a heavy speculum can increase intraocular pressure or cause vitreous upthrust in open-globe situations.

### 2. Keratome
A keratome has a thin, diamond-shaped or lanceolate blade with a sharp apex and two cutting edges.
*   **Sizes:** Available in 2.8 mm, 3.0 mm, 3.2 mm, and 5.5 mm.
*   **Uses:**
    *   To make the **Main Port Incision**: A valvular clear corneal or corneoscleral tunnel incision for entry into the [[Anterior Chamber]].
    *   Used in [[Phacoemulsification]], Manual Small Incision Cataract Surgery ([[SICS]]), and conventional [[ECCE]].
*   **Clinical Implication:** A sharp keratome creates a self-sealing wound, often eliminating the need for sutures in phacoemulsification.

### 3. Kelman-McPherson’s Forceps
Fine forceps with bent/angled limbs.
*   **Uses:**
    *   **IOL Implantation:** To hold the superior haptic of the IOL during placement into the capsular bag.
    *   **Capsulotomy:** To tear off the anterior capsular flap in ECCE.
    *   **Suturing:** Can be used for suture tying in microsurgery.

### 4. Sinsky’s Hook (IOL Dialer)
A fine but stout instrument with a bent tip that engages the dialing holes of the IOL.
*   **Uses:**
    *   **Dialing:** To rotate and position the PMMA non-foldable IOL or foldable IOL into the capsular bag or ciliary sulcus.
    *   **Nucleus Manipulation:** Used during phacoemulsification to rotate the nucleus, crack the nucleus, or feed nuclear fragments into the phaco tip.

### 5. Needle Holder
Instruments used to hold fine needles for suturing corneal, scleral, or conjunctival wounds.
*   **Spring Action (Barraquer’s Type):** Delicate, spring-loaded handle without locks or with gentle locks. Used for fine suturing (10-0 nylon) in cornea and sclera.
*   **Castroviejo’s Needle Holder:** Medium-sized with an S-shaped locking system. Used for general microsurgery.
*   **Silcock’s / Arruga’s / Kalt:** Larger needle holders with broad plates for the thumb. Used for passing superior rectus bridle sutures or lid surgery.

## Surgical Procedure: IOL Implantation

The implantation is typically the final stage of cataract extraction.

### Pre-requisites (Biometry)
Calculation of IOL power is done using [[Biometry]].
*   **A-Scan Ultrasound:** Measures **Axial Length**.
*   **Keratometry:** Measures corneal curvature.
*   **Formula:** **SRK Formula** ($P = A - 2.5L - 0.9K$) is the basic regression formula. Newer formulas like **SRK-T**, **Holladay**, and **Hoffer-Q** are used for extreme axial lengths.

### Steps of Implantation (Posterior Chamber IOL)
1.  **Viscoelastic Injection:** The capsular bag and anterior chamber are filled with [[Viscoelastic Substance]] (e.g., Sodium Hyaluronate or Methylcellulose) to maintain space and protect the endothelium.
2.  **Insertion (Rigid PMMA):**
    *   The IOL is grasped by the optic using an **IOL holding forceps**.
    *   The inferior haptic is inserted behind the iris into the bag at the 6 o'clock position.
    *   The superior haptic is grasped (often with **McPherson’s forceps**), pushed down, and released to slide into the upper part of the bag.
3.  **Insertion (Foldable):**
    *   The IOL is loaded into a cartridge and injected using an **Injector System** through a small incision.
4.  **Dialing:**
    *   A **Sinsky hook (IOL Dialer)** is used to rotate the lens via dialing holes to ensure haptics are horizontally oriented and secure within the bag.
5.  **Finalization:**
    *   Viscoelastic is aspirated using an Irrigation-Aspiration (I/A) probe.
    *   The anterior chamber is reformed with Balanced Salt Solution (BSS).
    *   Stromal hydration of ports is done to seal the wound (in sutureless surgery).

## Complications Related to IOL

*   **Malposition:**
    *   **Sunset Syndrome:** Inferior subluxation of the IOL.
    *   **Sunrise Syndrome:** Superior subluxation.
    *   **Lost Lens Syndrome:** Dislocation of IOL into the [[Vitreous]].
    *   **Windshield Wiper Syndrome:** Movement of a small IOL in the ciliary sulcus with head movement.
*   **UGH Syndrome:** Uveitis-Glaucoma-Hyphema syndrome, commonly associated with rigid Anterior Chamber IOLs or iris-claw lenses.
*   **Pupillary Capture:** The optic of the IOL moves anterior to the iris.
*   **After Cataract (PCO):** Opacification of the posterior capsule behind the IOL. Treated with [[Nd:YAG Laser]] capsulotomy.
