# Torticollis (Acquired)

### Definition
**Torticollis** (Latin: *tortus* = twisted; *collum* = neck), also known as **Wry Neck** or **Skew Neck**, is a deformity where the neck is twisted. It is characterized by the head being tilted towards the affected side, while the chin is rotated and pointed towards the opposite side.

While congenital forms exist (e.g., [[Sternocleidomastoid Tumor]]), **Acquired Torticollis** refers to the development of the deformity later in life due to secondary causes.

### Etiology and Classification
Acquired torticollis can be classified based on the underlying etiology. It is often secondary to other local disorders.

| Type | Underlying Cause | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Reflex Torticollis** | • **Acute Disc Prolapse** (Commonest cause in adults)<br>• Inflamed cervical lymph nodes (Lymphadenitis)<br>• Retropharyngeal abscess | Due to muscle spasm protecting a painful lesion. The [[Sternocleidomastoid muscle]] goes into spasm to prevent movement at the affected site. |
| **Infective** | • [[Tuberculosis of Spine]] (TB)<br>• Pyogenic infection (Osteomyelitis)<br>• Inflamed neck glands (Tonsillitis, Pharyngitis) | Infection leads to irritation of nerve roots or direct muscle involvement, causing spasm. |
| **Traumatic** | • Fracture-dislocations of cervical spine<br>• Soft tissue injury (e.g., [[Whiplash Injury]])<br>• **Rotary Subluxation** (C1-C2) | Sudden twisting strain or direct trauma causes protective muscle splinting. |
| **Spasmodic** | • CNS disorder (Dystonia)<br>• Idiopathic | Characterized by clonic or tonic spasms of the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius. Often painful and seen in adults. |
| **Ocular** | • Visual defects<br>• Squint (Strabismus)<br>• CN IV palsy | The patient tilts the head to compensate for visual disturbances (e.g., diplopia). |
| **Rheumatic** | • Exposure to cold/draughts | Also known as "Fibromyositis". Sudden onset after sleeping in a draft. |
| **Psychogenic** | • Hysteria | Functional deformity without organic pathology. |

### Clinical Features
The presentation depends on the underlying cause, but general features include:

*   **Deformity:**
    *   The head is flexed and tilted **towards** the side of the affected muscle.
    *   The chin is rotated **away** from the affected side (towards the opposite shoulder).

*   **Pain and Stiffness:**
    *   **Acute onset:** Usually associated with severe pain and stiffness (e.g., acute disc prolapse or "crick in the neck" from cold exposure).
    *   **Insidious onset:** May be painless initially (e.g., ocular or early TB), but spasmodic types are often painful.
*   **Muscle Spasm:** The [[Sternocleidomastoid muscle]] (SCM) on the affected side is often prominent, tight, and tender.
*   **Restricted Movement:** Active and passive movements are limited, particularly rotation towards the side of the deformity and lateral flexion away from it.

#### Specific Presentations by Cause
*   **Acute Disc Prolapse:** Sudden onset of pain and stiffness, often radiating to the upper limb or scapula. History of strain may be trivial.
*   **Spasmodic Torticollis:** Irregular, involuntary contractions of cervical muscles. Can be transient or permanent. Often associated with psychological stress but has an organic CNS basis.
*   **Ocular Torticollis:** The deformity is correctable voluntarily. The SCM is not contracted or tight. The head position corrects when the patient covers one eye.

### Diagnosis and Investigation
The diagnosis is primarily clinical, focusing on identifying the secondary cause.

**1. History**
*   **Onset:** Sudden (Trauma, Disc, Rheumatic) vs. Gradual (TB, Ocular).
*   **Trauma:** History of falls, RTA, or heavy lifting.
*   **Infection:** Recent sore throat, fever, or respiratory infection (Grisel's syndrome in children).
*   **Occupation:** Posture-related strain.

**2. Physical Examination**
*   **Look:** Check posture, asymmetry, and skin changes (scars, sinuses).
*   **Feel:** Palpate SCM for spasm/tenderness. Palpate spinous processes for tenderness (Infection/Trauma).
*   **Move:** Assess Cervical ROM. Neurological exam of upper limbs to rule out root compression (Radiculopathy).
*   **Special Tests:**
    *   **Eye exam:** Check for squint/diplopia.
    *   **Spurling’s test:** For cervical radiculopathy.

**3. Imaging**
*   **X-ray Cervical Spine (AP/Lateral/Open Mouth):** To rule out bony anomalies, fractures, or infections (e.g., retropharyngeal abscess widening prevertebral shadow).
*   **MRI:** Best for evaluating [[Intervertebral Disc Prolapse]], spinal cord, and soft tissue infections.

### Treatment
Treatment is directed toward the underlying cause.

#### 1. Conservative Management
Most acquired cases (e.g., secondary to disc prolapse or muscle strain) respond to non-operative measures:
*   **Rest & Immobilization:** Application of a **Cervical Collar** (soft or hard) to relieve muscle spasm and prevent unguarded movements.
*   **Analgesics/NSAIDs:** To control pain and inflammation (e.g., Diclofenac, Ibuprofen).
*   **Heat Therapy:** Hot packs or short-wave diathermy to relax muscles.
*   **Traction:** Intermittent cervical traction (Head halter traction) may be used to relieve spasm and nerve root compression in disc prolapse.
*   **Physiotherapy:** Gentle passive manipulation and exercises after the acute phase subsides.

#### 2. Specific Therapy
*   **Infective:** Appropriate antibiotics and drainage of abscesses if present (e.g., retropharyngeal abscess).
*   **Ocular:** Corrective glasses or surgery for squint.
*   **Spasmodic:** Difficult to treat. Options include muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines, or Botulinum toxin (Botox) injections into the dystonic muscles.

#### 3. Surgical Management
Surgery is rarely indicated for acquired torticollis unless there is a specific pathology requiring decompression or stabilization:
*   **Discectomy:** For refractory acute disc prolapse causing persistent root compression.
*   **Decompression/Fusion:** For spinal infections (TB) or unstable fractures.
*   **Muscle Release:** Rarely, severe persistent spasmodic torticollis may require surgical division of muscles or nerves (denervation), but results are variable.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Red Flags:** Torticollis accompanied by fever, dysphagia, or stridor suggests a **retropharyngeal abscess** or deep neck space infection—this is a medical emergency.
*   **Neurology:** Always perform a neurological exam. Torticollis with upper limb paresthesia strongly suggests **Cervical Disc Prolapse** at C5/C6 level.
*   **Children:** Acquired torticollis in children after a respiratory infection may indicate **Grisel’s Syndrome** (atlantoaxial subluxation)—requires urgent stabilization.
