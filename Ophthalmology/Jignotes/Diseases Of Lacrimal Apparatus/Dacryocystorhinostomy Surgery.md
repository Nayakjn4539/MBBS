# Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR)

**Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR)** is a surgical procedure performed to establish a low-resistance drainage pathway for tears between the [[lacrimal sac]] and the [[nasal cavity]] (specifically the [[middle meatus]]), bypassing an obstruction in the [[nasolacrimal duct (NLD)]],.

### Indications
DCR is the operation of choice for re-establishing lacrimal drainage.
*   **[[Chronic dacryocystitis]]**: The most common indication, usually due to NLD obstruction.
*   **[[Lacrimal mucocele]]**: Distension of the sac with mucus.
*   **[[Lacrimal pyocele]]**: Pus accumulation in the sac (after control of acute infection).
*   **Failed Conservative Treatment**: In [[congenital dacryocystitis]] after the age of 4 years, where probing and balloon dilation have failed,.
*   **Post-traumatic NLD Obstruction**: Traumatic strictures.
*   **Lacrimal Fistula**: Combined fistulectomy and DCR.

### Contraindications
In certain conditions, DCR is contraindicated, and **[[Dacryocystectomy (DCT)]]** (excision of the sac) is performed instead:
1.  **Malignancy**: Tumors of the [[lacrimal sac]],.
2.  **Specific Infections**: [[Tuberculosis]], [[Syphilis]], [[Leprosy]], or mycotic infections of the sac,.
3.  **Nasal Pathology**: Gross nasal diseases like [[atrophic rhinitis]] (where the anastomosis would dry up and close),.
4.  **Extremes of Age**: Very old patients (e.g., >60 years) or very young children (<4 years) may be considered for DCT if DCR is not feasible or necessary.
5.  **Fibrosed Sac**: A markedly shrunken and fibrosed sac (technically difficult to form flaps).

### Pre-operative Evaluation
Before surgery, the patency and pathology must be confirmed:
*   **[[Lacrimal syringing]]**: To demonstrate obstruction.
*   **Nasal Examination**: To rule out [[deviated nasal septum (DNS)]], polyps, or [[atrophic rhinitis]].
*   **[[Dacryocystography (DCG)]]**: To visualize the exact site, nature, and extent of the block, or presence of diverticula/tumors.

### Types of DCR Techniques
1.  **Conventional External DCR**: The gold standard with the highest success rate (approx. 95%).
2.  **Endonasal DCR**: Performed via the nose using an endoscope.
3.  **Endocanalicular Laser DCR**: Laser probe passed through the canaliculus to create the ostium.

### Surgical Technique: Conventional External DCR
This procedure creates a fistula between the [[lacrimal sac]] and the [[nasal mucosa]] of the [[middle meatus]].

**Steps:**
1.  **Anaesthesia**: usually General Anaesthesia (GA) or Local Anaesthesia (LA) with vasoconstrictors.
2.  **Incision**: A straight or curved skin incision is made over the [[anterior lacrimal crest]], 8 mm medial to the [[medial canthus]].
3.  **Exposure**: The [[medial palpebral ligament (MPL)]] is exposed and cut. The periosteum is separated from the anterior lacrimal crest and the lacrimal sac is reflected laterally.
4.  **Osteotomy (Bone Removal)**: A bony ostium (window) size ~15 mm x 10 mm is created by removing the anterior lacrimal crest and lacrimal fossa bones using a [[bone punch]] or chisel,. This exposes the underlying pinkish nasal mucosa.
5.  **Flap Preparation**:
    *   Vertical incisions are made in the medial wall of the lacrimal sac and the exposed nasal mucosa.
    *   Extensions are made to convert these into an **'H' shape**, creating anterior and posterior flaps for both the sac and nasal mucosa.
6.  **Suturing**:
    *   **Posterior Flaps**: The posterior flap of the sac is sutured to the posterior flap of the nasal mucosa (using absorbable sutures like 6-0 Vicryl).
    *   **Anterior Flaps**: The anterior flap of the sac is sutured to the anterior flap of the nasal mucosa.
    *   *Note*: Some surgeons intubate with silicone tubes at this stage to maintain patency.
7.  **Closure**: The MPL is sutured, followed by the orbicularis muscle and skin.

### Endonasal DCR
Performed by ENT surgeons or ophthalmologists using an endoscope.
*   **Procedure**: The sac area is identified endoscopically (often by transillumination from a light pipe in the canaliculus). The bone and mucosa are removed from inside the nose to create the opening.
*   **Laser DCR**: Lasers (e.g., [[Holmium-YAG laser]]) can be used to ablate the tissue and bone.

**Comparison: External vs. Endonasal DCR**

| Feature | **External DCR** | **Endonasal DCR** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Success Rate** | High (~95%) | Lower (70–90%) |
| **Scarring** | Cutaneous scar present | No external scar (cosmetically better) |
| **Bleeding** | Relatively more | Relatively bloodless |
| **Pump Function** | May be disturbed due to muscle incision | Lacrimal pump preserved |
| **Time** | More operating time (45–60 mins) | Less time consuming (15–30 mins) |
| **Vizualization** | Direct view of flaps | Better view of nasal pathology |
| **Cost** | Cheap (no expensive equipment) | Expensive (requires endoscope/laser) |

### Complications of DCR
1.  **Intraoperative**:
    *   Haemorrhage (bleeding from nasal mucosa or angular vein).
    *   Injury to internal structures (e.g., [[cribriform plate]], resulting in CSF leak).
    *   Orbital fat herniation.
2.  **Postoperative**:
    *   **Closure of Osteum**: The most common cause of failure, leading to recurrence of epiphora.
    *   **Sump Syndrome**: Collection of tears in the lower part of the sac if the osteum is made too high.
    *   External scarring (in external DCR).
    *   Bleeding (Epistaxis).
    *   Infection.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Failed DCR**: If a DCR fails due to canalicular obstruction or fibrosis, a **[[Conjunctivodacryocystorhinostomy (CDCR)]]** may be performed with the insertion of a Jones tube (glass tube).
*   **Adjuncts**: [[Mitomycin C]] (intraoperative) or silicone tube intubation is often used in complex cases or repeat surgeries to prevent closure of the ostium.
