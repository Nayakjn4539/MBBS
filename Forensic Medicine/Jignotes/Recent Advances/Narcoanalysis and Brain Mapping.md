### Recent Advances in Forensic Investigation

## 1. Narcoanalysis (Narco-Test)

**Synonyms:** Truth Serum Test, Drug-Assisted Interview, Amytal Interview.

**Definition:**
It is an investigative technique used to extract information from a subject (accused, suspect, or witness) by inducing a hypnotic or sedated state using specific drugs. The term "Truth Serum" is a **misnomer** because the drugs do not guarantee the truth; they merely lower inhibitions.

**Principle:**
The technique relies on the concept that at a certain level of sedation (the **"Twilight Zone"**), a person's protective instinct and inhibitions are suppressed. Lying requires imagination and conscious effort, which becomes difficult in a semi-conscious state. The subject becomes talkative and is more likely to reveal repressed feelings, memories, or facts.

**Drugs Used:**
These are central nervous system depressants.
*   **Sodium Pentothal** ([[Thiopentone Sodium]]): Most commonly used.
*   **Sodium Amytal** (Amobarbital).
*   **Sodium Seconal** (Secobarbital).
*   **Scopolamine** (Hyoscine hydrobromide).

> **Mnemonic for Drugs:** **PASS** the Truth
> *   **P** - Pentothal (Sodium)
> *   **A** - Amytal
> *   **S** - Seconal
> *   **S** - Scopolamine

**Procedure:**
1.  **Consent:** Informed written consent is mandatory before the procedure.
2.  **Team:** A team comprising an [[Anesthetist]], a [[Forensic Psychiatrist]]/Psychologist, and an audio-videographer is required.
3.  **Technique:**
    *   The drug (e.g., Sodium Pentothal 2.5% to 5%) is injected intravenously very slowly.
    *   The rate is titrated to induce a state of "hypnotic trance" or semiconsciousness.
    *   Once the subject enters the uninhibited state, the forensic psychologist asks questions related to the crime.
    *   The entire session is video-recorded.

**Reliability and Limitations:**
*   **Not 100% Reliable:** Subjects with strong willpower or those who are hardened criminals can still deceive the examiner or remain silent.
*   **Suggestibility:** The subject is highly suggestible in this state and may answer leading questions falsely to please the examiner.
*   **Fantasy vs Fact:** The subject may mix fact with fantasy (confabulation), making it difficult to separate truth from imagination.

**Medicolegal Aspects:**
*   **Article 20(3) Constitution of India:** "No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself." Forcible administration violates this right against [[Self-Incrimination]].
*   **Supreme Court Ruling (2010):** In *Selvi vs State of Karnataka*, the Supreme Court held that narcoanalysis, polygraph, and brain mapping cannot be conducted without the subject's **consent**.
*   **Admissibility:** The statement given during narcoanalysis is **not admissible** as primary evidence in court. However, any **material evidence** discovered subsequently based on the information revealed during the test (e.g., location of a weapon) is admissible under **Section 27 of the [[Indian Evidence Act]]**.

## 2. Brain Mapping (Brain Fingerprinting)

**Definition:**
It is a non-invasive forensic technique that measures electrical brain wave responses to specific stimuli (words, pictures, or sounds) related to a crime to determine if the subject has prior knowledge of the event.

**Principle:**
It is based on the theory that the brain stores details of an event (like a crime) as a memory trace. When the brain processes relevant information that it recognizes, it emits a specific electrical wave response known as **P300** or **MERMER**.
*   **P300:** A positive electrical voltage occurring approx 300 milliseconds after the stimulus.
*   **MERMER:** Memory and Encoding Related Multifaceted Electroencephalographic Response (a more complex pattern containing P300).

**Procedure:**
1.  **Setup:** The suspect wears a headband equipped with EEG sensors ([[Electro-Cap]]).
2.  **Stimuli Presentation:** The subject is shown a series of visuals or words on a computer screen. These are classified into:
    *   **Targets:** Familiar information (known to everyone).
    *   **Irrelevants:** Information unrelated to the crime.
    *   **Probes:** Specific details of the crime known *only* to the perpetrator and investigators (e.g., the murder weapon, specific location).
3.  **Recording:** A computer records the brain's electrical activity.

**Inference:**
*   **Guilty/Knowledge Present:** If the subject's brain recognizes the "Probe" stimuli, a **P300 wave** (or MERMER) is elicited. This indicates "Information Present."
*   **Innocent/No Knowledge:** If the subject does not recognize the details, no specific wave is generated ("Information Absent").

**Advantages:**
*   **Objectivity:** It relies on involuntary brain responses, not verbal answers or emotional states (unlike the [[Polygraph]]).
*   **Non-invasive:** No drugs or physical interventions are used.
*   **Accuracy:** Proponents claim very high accuracy (near 100%), though this is debated scientifically.

### Comparison: Polygraph vs. Narcoanalysis vs. Brain Mapping

| Feature | Polygraph (Lie Detector) | Narcoanalysis | Brain Mapping |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Basis** | Autonomic arousal (Fear/Anxiety) | Pharmacological disinhibition | Brain wave recognition (Cognitive) |
| **Parameters** | BP, Pulse, Respiration, Skin conductivity | Verbal statements under sedation | Electrical potentials (P300/MERMER) |
| **Invasiveness** | Non-invasive | Invasive (IV Drugs) | Non-invasive |
| **Requires Oral Answer**| Yes (Yes/No) | Yes (Detailed answers) | No (Silent observation) |
| **Legal Status** | Need Consent; Corroborative only | Need Consent; Corroborative only | Need Consent; Corroborative only |
