# [[Asphyxia]] > Traumatic Asphyxia

### **Traumatic Asphyxia**

**Synonyms:** [[Crush Asphyxia]], Compression Asphyxia.

**Definition**
Traumatic asphyxia is a form of mechanical asphyxia caused by the **mechanical fixation of the chest wall** (and often the abdomen) by external pressure, preventing respiratory movements (inspiration and expiration). Consequently, gas exchange is halted despite the airway remaining patent.

### **Etiology (Causes)**
This condition usually arises from accidents involving heavy weights or massive pressure:
1.  **Stampedes:** Panic in large crowds where victims are crushed against walls or trampled.
2.  **Vehicular Accidents:** Being pinned between a vehicle and a wall, or under an overturned vehicle.
3.  **Industrial/Construction Accidents:** Collapse of walls, earth, or machinery falling on the chest.
4.  **Jack-knife Position:** seen in earthquakes or landslides where the body is bent forcibly, driving the thighs and knees against the chest.

### **Pathophysiology (Mechanism of Signs)**
The unique physical signs of traumatic asphyxia are due to a specific hemodynamic mechanism:
1.  **Chest Compression:** Sudden, severe compression of the chest wall prevents respiratory movement.
2.  **"Fear" Response:** The victim often takes a deep breath and closes the glottis just before impact (Valsalva maneuver).
3.  **Differential Heart Compression:** The compression squeezes the thinner/weaker **Right Heart**, pushing blood back into the **[[Superior Vena Cava]]**. However, the stronger Left Heart continues to pump arterial blood into the head and neck for a short time.
4.  **Retrograde Venous Flow:** The huge hydrostatic pressure forces blood backward from the SVC into the veins of the head and neck.
5.  **Valveless Veins:** Since the veins of the head and neck are **valveless**, there is nothing to stop this retrograde column of blood.
6.  **Capillary Rupture:** This causes massive engorgement and rupture of venules and capillaries in the face, neck, and upper chest.

### **Clinical Features / Autopsy Findings**

#### **1. External Findings**
*   **Masque Ecchymotique (Ecchymotic Mask):** This is the most diagnostic feature.
    *   **Appearance:** Intense, deep purple, violet, or dark red discoloration of the face, neck, and upper chest (above the level of compression).
    *   **Demarcation:** There is a sharp line of demarcation; the skin *below* the level of compression is usually pale.
    *   **Nature:** This discoloration is due to diffuse petechiae and venous engorgement, *not* true soft tissue bruising from direct trauma.
*   **Tardieu Spots:** Numerous petechial hemorrhages are seen in the skin of the face, eyelids, and scalp.
*   **Ocular Signs:**
    *   Gross congestion and hemorrhage of the **[[conjunctiva]]**.
    *   Subconjunctival hemorrhages are prominent (blood-red eyes).
    *   Retinal hemorrhages may be present.
    *   Bulging of eyes (Proptosis).
*   **Pressure Marks (Pale Areas):** Within the cyanosed/purple area, there may be patches of pale, white skin. These correspond to areas where tight clothing (collars, buttoned shirts, bra straps, hat brims) pressed against the skin, preventing the capillaries from filling with blood. This is known as **Contact Pallor**.
*   **Bleeding:** From nose (epistaxis) and ears due to ruptured vessels.

#### **2. Internal Findings**
*   **Lungs:** Congested, heavy, and dark. May show subpleural petechiae.
*   **Brain:** Cerebral congestion and petechial hemorrhages.
*   **Heart:** Right side of the heart is usually distended.
*   **Injuries:** Associated fractures of ribs, sternum, or spine (thoracic vertebrae) and lacerations of liver/spleen may be found depending on the weight of the crushing object.

### **Specific Medicolegal Entity: Burking**
This is a historical method of homicide that combines **Traumatic Asphyxia** and **[[Smothering]]**.

*   **Origin:** Named after William Burke and William Hare (Edinburgh, 19th Century) who killed victims to sell bodies to anatomists.
*   **Method:**
    1.  The victim (often intoxicated) is thrown to the ground.
    2.  The assailant sits or kneels on the victim's chest (**Traumatic Asphyxia**).
    3.  Simultaneously, the assailant closes the victim's nose and mouth with their hands (**Smothering**).
*   **Result:** Rapid death with minimal external signs of violence, often mistaken for natural death in the pre-forensic era.

### **Medicolegal Aspects**
*   **Manner of Death:** Almost exclusively **Accidental** (stampedes, collapses).
*   **Homicide:** Rare, except in cases of **[[Burking]]**.
*   **Prognosis:** If the victim survives the initial compression, the discoloration (Masque Ecchymotique) usually fades in 10–14 days without the color changes seen in typical bruises (as the blood is intravascular, simply deoxygenated and static, rather than extravascular).

### **Mnemonic for Findings**
**"CRUSH"**
*   **C**yanosis (Intense, purple face/neck)
*   **R**ed eyes (Subconjunctival hemorrhage)
*   **U**pper body discoloration (above compression)
*   **S**pots (Tardieu spots/Petechiae)
*   **H**eart mechanism (Backflow due to right heart compression)
