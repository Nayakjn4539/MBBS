# [[Clinical Examination]] > Examination of Shoulder

### Clinical Examination of the Shoulder

The shoulder examination follows the systematic orthopedic principle of **Look, Feel, Move**, followed by specific **Special Tests** to identify the pathology. The patient should be suitably undressed to the waist to allow comparison between the normal and affected sides.

#### 1. Inspection (Look)
Inspection must be performed from the front, side, and back.

*   **Attitude/Posture:**
    *   Note how the patient holds the arm. In anterior dislocation, the patient often supports the injured limb with the other hand.
    *   **Shoulder Contour:** Normally rounded due to the [[Head of humerus]] and [[Deltoid]].
        *   **Flattening:** Indicates [[Anterior dislocation of shoulder]] or deltoid wasting (e.g., [[Axillary nerve]] palsy).
        *   **Swelling:** May indicate effusion, infection, or tumor. A localized bulge over the deltoid when the elbow is flexed ("Popeye sign") indicates a rupture of the [[Long head of biceps]].
    *   **Deformity:**
        *   **Step Deformity:** A prominent "step" at the tip of the shoulder suggests [[Acromioclavicular dislocation]].
        *   **Winging of Scapula:** The medial border of the scapula becomes prominent, indicating weakness of the [[Serratus anterior]] muscle (injury to the [[Long thoracic nerve]]).
    *   **Skin:** Look for scars (previous surgery), sinuses (infection), or redness.

#### 2. Palpation (Feel)
The examiner stands behind or to the side of the patient. Palpate systematically from the sternoclavicular joint outwards.

*   **Temperature:** Check for local warmth (inflammation/infection).
*   **Tenderness:** Palpate bony landmarks:
    *   [[Sternoclavicular joint]].
    *   [[Clavicle]].
    *   [[Acromioclavicular joint]].
    *   [[Acromion process]].
    *   [[Coracoid process]].
    *   **Bicipital Groove:** Tenderness here suggests [[Bicipital tendinitis]].
    *   **Supraspinatus insertion:** Tenderness just distal to the acromion edge suggests [[Supraspinatus tendinitis]] or cuff tear.
*   **Crepitus:** Felt during passive movement, suggestive of [[Osteoarthritis]] or chronic bursitis.

#### 3. Movements (Move)
Assess both **Active** and **Passive** movements.
*   **Active Movement:** Ask the patient to move the arm. Note the range and rhythm.
*   **Passive Movement:** The examiner moves the arm. Essential to distinguish true [[Glenohumeral joint]] movement from scapulothoracic movement by fixing the scapula with one hand.

**Normal Ranges:**
*   **Abduction:** 0–180° (0–90° glenohumeral, 90–180° scapulothoracic).
*   **Adduction:** 0–45°.
*   **Flexion:** 0–180°.
*   **Extension:** 0–45°.
*   **External Rotation:** 0–90° (Tested with elbow flexed at 90°).
*   **Internal Rotation:** 0–90° (Tested by reaching up the back).

**Clinical Implications:**
*   **Painful Arc Syndrome:** Pain specifically between 60° and 120° of abduction suggests [[Impingement syndrome]] or [[Supraspinatus tendinitis]].
*   **Frozen Shoulder:** Global restriction of all movements (active and passive), with external rotation being the most restricted.

#### 4. Muscle Power Testing
*   **Deltoid:** Abduct arm against resistance.
*   **Serratus Anterior:** Patient pushes against a wall; look for winging of the scapula.
*   **Pectoralis Major:** Patient presses hands firmly into their waist.

#### 5. Neurological Assessment
*   **Regimental Badge Sign:** Test for sensation over the lateral aspect of the upper arm (over the deltoid). Loss of sensation indicates injury to the [[Axillary nerve]], common in anterior dislocation.

### Special Tests for Shoulder Pathology

These tests are crucial for differential diagnosis in exams.

#### A. Tests for Shoulder Dislocation / Instability

| Test Name | Methodology | Positive Sign | Clinical Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Duga’s Test]]** | Patient asked to touch the opposite shoulder with the hand of the affected side. | Inability to touch the opposite shoulder. | [[Anterior dislocation of shoulder]] |
| **[[Hamilton’s Ruler Test]]** | Place a straight edge (ruler) along the lateral aspect of the arm. | Ruler touches the [[Acromion process]] and [[Lateral epicondyle]] simultaneously. | Dislocation (loss of deltoid bulge) |
| **[[Callaway’s Test]]** | Measure the vertical circumference of the axilla. | Increased girth compared to the normal side. | Anterior dislocation |
| **[[Apprehension Test]]** | Abduct and externally rotate the arm while pushing the humeral head anteriorly. | Patient resists/shows fear (apprehension) that the shoulder will pop out. | Recurrent anterior instability |
| **[[Sulcus Sign]]** | Pull the arm downwards. | Appearance of a sulcus/gap below the acromion. | [[Inferior instability]] or Multidirectional instability |

#### B. Tests for Impingement Syndrome

| Test Name | Methodology | Positive Sign |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Neer’s Impingement Test]]** | Stabilize scapula, passively flex the arm forward fully (jamming greater tuberosity against acromion). | Pain indicates subacromial impingement. |
| **[[Hawkins-Kennedy Test]]** | Flex shoulder to 90°, flex elbow to 90°, then forcibly internally rotate the shoulder. | Pain indicates impingement. |

#### C. Tests for Rotator Cuff Tears

| Muscle Tested | Test Name | Methodology |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Supraspinatus]]** | **Empty Can / [[Jobe’s Test]]** | Abduct arm to 90°, angle forward 30°, point thumb down (like emptying a can), resist downward pressure. |
| **[[Subscapularis]]** | **[[Lift-Off Test]]** | Hand behind back (dorsum on lumbar spine); patient attempts to lift hand away from back. |
| | **[[Belly Press Test]]** | Patient presses hand against abdomen; elbow should not drop back. |
| | **[[Bear Hug Test]]** | Patient places hand on opposite shoulder; examiner tries to lift it off. |
| **[[Infraspinatus]]** / **[[Teres Minor]]** | **External Rotation Lag** | Arm at side, elbow 90°; patient resists internal rotation force. |
| | **[[Hornblower’s Sign]]** | Arm abducted 90°, elbow 90°; patient tries to externally rotate against resistance. |
