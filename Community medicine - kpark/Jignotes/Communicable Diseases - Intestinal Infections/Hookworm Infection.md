# [[Communicable Diseases - Intestinal Infections]] > Hookworm Infection

# Hookworm Infection (Ancylostomiasis)

**Hookworm infection** is a major [[Soil-Transmitted Helminth]] (STH) infection caused by nematode parasites. It is a leading cause of [[Iron Deficiency Anemia]] in the developing world, significantly impacting physical growth and cognitive development in children and productivity in adults.

### 1. Epidemiological Determinants

#### Agent Factors
*   **Causative Agents:**
    1.  ***Ancylostoma duodenale*** (Old World Hookworm): More virulent; causes more blood loss.
    2.  ***Necator americanus*** (New World Hookworm): Widespread in tropics/subtropics.
*   **Morphology:** Adult worms live in the small intestine (mainly jejunum). They attach to the villi using teeth (*A. duodenale*) or cutting plates (*N. americanus*).
*   **Infective Stage:** [[Filariform Larva]] (3rd stage larva).
*   **Diagnostic Stage:** Eggs in feces (Non-bile stained, segmented, oval).
*   **Lifespan:** *A. duodenale* (~1 year); *N. americanus* (~4 years).

#### Host Factors
*   **Natural Host:** [[Man]] is the only important reservoir.
*   **Age/Sex:** Affects all ages, but highest incidence is often in 15–25 years age group. Agricultural workers are at high risk.
*   **Host-Parasite Balance:** In endemic areas, people may harbor worms without symptoms. Disease occurs when the worm load is high or iron reserves are low.
*   **Immunity:** No permanent immunity is acquired. Reinfection is common.

#### Environmental Factors
*   **Soil:** Damp, sandy, or friable soil with decaying vegetation is ideal. Clay soil is unfavorable.
*   **Temperature:** 24°C to 32°C is optimal for larval development.
*   **Moisture:** Essential for survival of larvae; desiccation kills them.
*   **Human Habits:** Indiscriminate [[Open Defecation]] and walking **barefoot** are the primary drivers of transmission.

### 2. Transmission
*   **Route:**
    *   **Percutaneous (Skin Penetration):** Most common. [[Filariform larvae]] in the soil penetrate the soft skin (usually between toes, dorsum of foot) of a barefoot person.
    *   **Oral Route:** *A. duodenale* larvae can also infect via ingestion of contaminated food/water (less common).
*   **Risk of Person-to-Person Transmission:** **None**. The eggs passed in fresh feces are non-infective. They require a developmental period in the soil (extrinsic incubation) to become infective larvae.

### 3. Life Cycle (Pathogenesis)
> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Flowchart showing life cycle: Eggs in stool -> Soil -> Rhabditiform larva -> Filariform larva -> Skin penetration -> Venous circulation -> Lungs -> Trachea -> Swallowed -> Small Intestine -> Adult worm

1.  **Copulation:** Male and female worms mate in the human intestine.
2.  **Egg Release:** Eggs passed in feces.
3.  **Soil Phase:**
    *   Eggs hatch in 1–2 days $\rightarrow$ **Rhabditiform larva** (L1, L2).
    *   Molts in 5–10 days $\rightarrow$ **Filariform larva** (L3 - Infective stage).
4.  **Invasion:** Larva penetrates human skin $\rightarrow$ Enters venous circulation.
5.  **Migration:** Heart $\rightarrow$ Lungs $\rightarrow$ Break into alveoli $\rightarrow$ Ascend bronchi/trachea $\rightarrow$ Swallowed.
6.  **Establishment:** Reaches small intestine $\rightarrow$ Molts $\rightarrow$ Becomes adult worm.

### 4. Incubation Period (Prepatent Period)
*   ***N. americanus***: ~7 weeks.
*   ***A. duodenale***: Highly variable; 5 weeks to 9 months (larvae can remain dormant).

### 5. Clinical Picture
The disease manifests in three phases corresponding to the life cycle:

| Phase | Symptoms/Signs | Clinical Term |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Invasion** | Itching, erythema, papules, vesicular eruption at the site of entry (usually feet/toes). | **[[Ground Itch]]** (Dew itch) |
| **Migration** | Mild transient pneumonitis, cough, eosinophilia (less severe than Ascariasis). | **[[Loeffler's Syndrome]]** |
| **Intestinal** | Epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. | |
| **Systemic** | **Microcytic Hypochromic Anemia** (Iron Deficiency), hypoproteinemia, edema, fatigue, pica (eating dirt). | **[[Nutritional Anemia]]** |

**Clinical Relevance: Blood Loss**
*   Hookworms suck blood and leave bleeding points in the intestine.
*   *N. americanus* blood loss: ~0.03 ml/worm/day.
*   *A. duodenale* blood loss: ~0.2 ml/worm/day (More dangerous).

### 6. Diagnosis
*   **Stool Examination:** Direct microscopy to detect characteristic oval, segmented eggs.
*   **Blood Picture:** Eosinophilia and Microcytic Hypochromic Anemia.
*   **Quantitative Assessment:** [[Chandler's Index]] is used for epidemiological studies. It measures the average number of eggs per gram of stool in the *entire community*.

**Chandler's Index Interpretation:**
*   **< 200:** Not significant.
*   **200–250:** Potential danger.
*   **250–300:** Minor public health problem.
*   **> 300:** **Important Public Health Problem.**

### 7. Treatment
**Deworming Drugs (Anti-helminthics):**
*   **Drug of Choice:** [[Albendazole]] (400 mg single dose) – preferred for mass administration.
*   **Alternative:** [[Mebendazole]] (100 mg twice daily for 3 days or 500 mg single dose).
*   **Other:** Pyrantel pamoate.

**Supportive Treatment:**
*   **Iron supplementation:** Ferrous sulphate to correct anemia.
*   **Nutritional support:** High protein diet.

> **Mnemonic for Treatment:** **A-M-P** it up against worms!
> *   **A**lbendazole
> *   **M**ebendazole
> *   **P**yrantel

### 8. Prevention and Control
Hookworm control requires a multi-pronged approach:

1.  **Sanitation (Primary Prevention):**
    *   Use of **Sanitary Latrines** to prevent soil pollution.
    *   Avoid usage of untreated human excreta as fertilizer.

2.  **Personal Protection:**
    *   Wearing **shoes/footwear** to prevent skin penetration.
    *   Personal hygiene (washing hands).

3.  **Mass Drug Administration (Secondary Prevention):**
    *   **Periodic Deworming:** WHO recommends periodic treatment of at-risk groups (preschool/school children, women of childbearing age) in endemic areas.
    *   **Target:** School-based deworming programs (e.g., National Deworming Day in India).

4.  **Health Education:**
    *   Educate community about the life cycle and the danger of open defecation.
