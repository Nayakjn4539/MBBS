# Madelung's Deformity

### Definition
**Madelung's deformity** is a congenital dyschondrosis of the distal radial physis that results in a complex multidirectional deformity of the wrist. It is characterized by a growth disturbance in the **volar-ulnar** aspect of the [[distal radial physis]], leading to an increased volar and ulnar tilt of the distal radial articular surface.

This condition results in the spontaneous subluxation or dislocation of the [[distal radioulnar joint]] (DRUJ), where the [[hand]] and [[carpus]] translate palmarly in relation to the forearm, leaving the [[ulnar head]] prominent dorsally.

### Epidemiology
*   **Sex:** Predominantly affects females (Male:Female ratio is approx 1:4).
*   **Laterality:** Frequently bilateral (50–60% of cases).
*   **Age of Onset:** Deformity typically becomes manifest during the adolescent growth spurt (age 10–14 years).
*   **Genetics:** Often associated with **[[Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis]]** (a mesomelic dwarfism). Can also be associated with [[Turner syndrome]].

### Etiopathogenesis
The primary pathology is a partial arrest or retardation of growth at the **volar-ulnar** corner of the [[distal radial epiphysis]].

1.  **Abnormal Growth:** The dorsal and radial parts of the [[radius]] continue to grow normally, while the volar-ulnar part lags behind.
2.  **Radial Tautness:** A thickened fibrous band, known as **[[Vickers ligament]]**, tethers the [[lunate]] to the [[distal radius]], restricting normal growth and pulling the carpus proximally and palmarly.
3.  **Resultant Deformity:**
    *   The [[radius]] becomes short and curved (bowed).
    *   The [[ulna]] continues to grow relatively straight, becoming longer than the radius ([[positive ulnar variance]]).
    *   The [[carpus]] wedges into the triangular defect created by the slanted radius.

### Clinical Features
The condition is often asymptomatic in childhood and presents due to cosmetic concerns or pain during adolescence.

*   **Deformity:**
    *   **Bayonet Deformity:** The hand is displaced palmarly and radially in relation to the forearm.
    *   **Prominent Ulnar Styloid:** The distal end of the [[ulna]] is visually prominent on the dorsal and ulnar aspect of the wrist (resembling a dinner fork deformity, but reversed compared to [[Colles fracture]]).
*   **Range of Motion (ROM):**
    *   Restricted **dorsiflexion** (extension) of the wrist.
    *   Restricted **supination** of the forearm.
    *   Flexion is usually preserved or increased.
*   **Pain:** Wrist pain, particularly on the ulnar side, due to [[ulnocarpal impaction]] or DRUJ incongruity.
*   **Manus Valgus:** The hand may appear deviated outwards.

### Radiological Features
X-rays (AP and Lateral views) are diagnostic.

| Feature | Radiological Finding |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Distal Radius** | Increased **volar tilt** and **ulnar inclination** of the articular surface. Shortening of the radius. |
| **Ulna** | **[[Positive ulnar variance]]** (ulna is longer than radius). Dorsal subluxation of the distal ulna. |
| **Carpus** | The carpal bones (specifically the [[lunate]]) form a triangle or "pyramid" shape, wedging between the radius and ulna. |
| **Distal Radioulnar Joint** | Widening of the [[DRUJ]]. |

### Differential Diagnosis
While predominantly congenital (dysplastic), "Madelung-like" deformities can be acquired due to:
*   **Trauma:** Repetitive injury or fracture involving the distal radial physis (Salter-Harris type injuries).
*   **Infection:** Osteomyelitis affecting the growth plate.
*   **Tumors:** [[Multiple hereditary exostosis]] (Osteochondromas) interfering with growth.

### Treatment
Treatment depends on the severity of pain, deformity, and the skeletal maturity of the patient.

#### 1. Conservative Management
*   **Indications:** Asymptomatic patients or mild deformity with minimal pain.
*   **Modalities:**
    *   Observation (periodic X-rays).
    *   **[[Splinting]]** (e.g., wrist cock-up splint) for pain relief during activity.
    *   Analgesics (NSAIDs).
    *   Activity modification.

#### 2. Surgical Management
Surgery is indicated for severe pain, significant limitation of motion (especially supination), or severe cosmetic deformity.

**A. In Skeletally Immature Patients (Growing Child):**
*   **[[Physiolysis]]:** Resection of the bony bar/bridge and release of the tethering **[[Vickers ligament]]**. This aims to restore normal growth.
*   **Epiphysiodesis:** Arresting the growth of the distal ulna or the healthy side of the radius to level the joint (rarely used alone).

**B. In Skeletally Mature Patients (Adolescents/Adults):**
*   **Corrective Osteotomy:**
    *   **[[Radial dome osteotomy]]** (or wedge osteotomy) to correct the volar and ulnar tilt of the radius.
*   **Ulnar Shortening Procedures:**
    *   **[[Darrach’s procedure]]:** Excision of the distal ulnar head (for elderly or low-demand patients with severe pain).
    *   **[[Sauve-Kapandji procedure]]:** Arthrodesis of the DRUJ with the creation of a pseudarthrosis in the distal ulna to allow rotation.
    *   **Ulnar shortening osteotomy:** To correct positive ulnar variance.

### Clinical Implications
*   **[[Rupture of extensor tendons]]:** In chronic cases, the prominent distal ulna can act as a saw, causing attritional rupture of the extensor tendons (e.g., [[extensor digitorum communis]]).
*   **Wrist Arthritis:** Long-standing incongruity leads to secondary **[[osteoarthritis]]** of the radiocarpal and distal radioulnar joints.
