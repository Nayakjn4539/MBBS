# [[Nutrition And Health]] > Nutritional Assessment of Community

### Nutritional Assessment of Community

Nutritional assessment is the systematic process of collecting and interpreting information to make decisions about the nature and cause of nutrition-related health issues affecting a community. It is the first step in formulating [[community diagnosis]] regarding malnutrition.

The methods of nutritional assessment are broadly classified into two categories: **Direct Methods** and **Indirect Methods**.

### A. Direct Methods
These methods deal with individuals within the community to assess their specific nutritional status. A useful mnemonic to remember the direct methods is **ABCD**.

**Mnemonic:** **ABCD**
*   **A** - **A**nthropometry
*   **B** - **B**iochemical methods
*   **C** - **C**linical examination
*   **D** - **D**ietary evaluation

#### 1. Anthropometry
This involves the measurement of physical dimensions and gross composition of the human body. It is the most common and practical method.

*   **Weight:** The single most sensitive parameter for assessing physical growth. It reflects **current** nutritional status.
    *   **Low Weight for Age:** Known as **Underweight**. It indicates both acute and chronic malnutrition.
    *   **Growth Charts:** Used to monitor weight over time. Flattening of the weight curve is the earliest sign of [[Protein Energy Malnutrition]] (PEM).
*   **Height:** A stable measurement of growth. It reflects **past** nutritional events.
    *   **Low Height for Age:** Known as **Stunting** (Chronic Malnutrition).
    *   **Low Weight for Height:** Known as **Wasting** (Acute Malnutrition).
*   **Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC):**
    *   Useful in children aged **1–5 years** as it remains practically constant.
    *   Measured using a non-stretchable tape on the left arm.
    *   **Shakir’s Tape:** A color-coded tape used by field workers for quick assessment.
        *   **Red (< 12.5 cm):** Severe malnutrition.
        *   **Yellow (12.5 – 13.5 cm):** Mild-moderate malnutrition.
        *   **Green (> 13.5 cm):** Normal nutritional status.
*   **Body Mass Index (BMI):** Also known as **Quetelet’s Index**.
    *   Formula: $Weight (kg) / Height (m)^2$.
    *   Used to assess thinness and obesity in adults.
    *   **Cut-offs (WHO for Indians):** Normal is **18.5 – 22.9 kg/m²**. >25 is obese.

#### 2. Biochemical Tests
These provide precise information on nutrient levels in body fluids and can detect **sub-clinical** deficiencies (hidden hunger) before clinical signs appear.

*   **Hemoglobin estimation:** Essential for diagnosing [[Nutritional Anaemia]].
*   **Serum Ferritin:** Most sensitive indicator of iron stores.
*   **Serum Retinol:** To assess [[Vitamin A deficiency]].
*   **Urinary Iodine:** Best indicator for recent iodine intake and surveillance of [[Iodine Deficiency Disorders]] (IDD).
*   **Serum Albumin:** To assess protein status (low levels indicate severe PEM/Kwashiorkor).

#### 3. Clinical Examination
This is an essential feature of all nutritional surveys. It involves looking for specific physical signs associated with malnutrition during a head-to-toe examination.

*   **General:** Thin/sickly build, edema (Kwashiorkor).
*   **Hair:** Sparse, discolored, easily pluckable (**Flag Sign** in Kwashiorkor).
*   **Eyes:** Night blindness, **Bitot’s spots** (foamy triangular patches), corneal xerosis (Vitamin A deficiency).
*   **Mouth:** Angular stomatitis, cheilosis (Riboflavin/B2 deficiency).
*   **Gums:** Spongy, bleeding gums (Vitamin C deficiency/Scurvy).
*   **Thyroid:** Enlargement (Goiter due to Iodine deficiency).
*   **Bones:** Knock-knees, bow legs, beading of ribs (**Rickety Rosary**) in Vitamin D deficiency.

> **Clinical Relevance:** While useful, clinical signs often appear late in the disease process. Therefore, they should be combined with other methods for accurate diagnosis.

#### 4. Dietary Survey (Dietary Intake Assessment)
This measures the actual food consumption of the community to identify inadequate intake.

*   **Weighment of Raw Foods:** This is the most accurate method for a family diet survey.
    *   The survey is typically conducted for **7 days** (one dietary cycle).
    *   All raw food to be cooked is weighed.
*   **24-Hour Recall (Oral Questionnaire):** Used for large populations. The subject is asked to recall all food/drink consumed in the last 24 hours.
*   **Food Balance Sheet:** Used at the national level to estimate food availability per capita.

### B. Indirect Methods
These methods use community-level data to infer nutritional status without examining individuals directly.

#### 1. Vital Statistics
Analysis of morbidity and mortality rates can identify high-risk groups.
*   **[[Infant Mortality Rate]] (IMR):** High IMR correlates with poor nutrition and socioeconomic status.
*   **Under-5 Mortality Rate:** Strongly related to malnutrition and infection.
*   **Low Birth Weight:** Indicates maternal malnutrition.
*   **Cause-Specific Mortality:** Deaths due to measles or diarrhea often have underlying malnutrition.

#### 2. Ecological Factors
Malnutrition is the result of multiple interacting ecological factors. Assessment includes:
*   **Socio-economic status:** Income, family size, education (especially maternal literacy).
*   **Health Services:** Coverage of immunization, Vitamin A prophylaxis, and antenatal care.
*   **Environmental Sanitation:** Water supply and hygiene (poor sanitation leads to recurrent infections which worsen malnutrition).
*   **Food Production:** Crop patterns and local food availability.
