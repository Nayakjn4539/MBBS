# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Elimination of Leprosy

# Elimination of Leprosy

### 1. Definition and Goal
**[[Elimination of Leprosy]]** is defined as the reduction of the prevalence of leprosy to a level where it ceases to be a public health problem. 

*   **Quantitative Target:** A **[[Prevalence Rate (PR)]]** of less than 1 case per 10,000 population,,.
*   **Concept:** Unlike eradication (which means tearing out by roots/zero incidence worldwide), elimination refers to interrupting transmission in a defined geographical area to a very low level,.

**Current Status in India:**
*   India achieved the goal of elimination of leprosy as a public health problem at the **National Level** in **December 2005**,.
*   **Current Vision:** [[Leprosy Mukt Bharat]] (Leprosy-free India).
*   **Current Goal:** Zero transmission, Zero disability, and Zero stigma.

### 2. Strategy for Elimination (NLEP)
The **[[National Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP)]]** utilizes a multi-pronged strategy to sustain elimination and move towards eradication.

**A. Early Case Detection**
*   **Active Surveillance:** House-to-house surveys in high endemic areas (e.g., **[[Leprosy Case Detection Campaign (LCDC)]]**).
*   **ABSULS:** **[[ASHA Based Surveillance for Leprosy Suspects]]**. Door-to-door surveillance to detect cases early.
*   **Focused Leprosy Campaign (FLC):** For hot spots/hard-to-reach areas.

**B. Treatment: [[Multi-Drug Therapy (MDT)]]**
*   The cornerstone of elimination. It renders infectious cases non-infectious rapidly (within days/weeks).
*   **Regimen:**
    *   **Paucibacillary (PB):** 2 drugs (Rifampicin, Dapsone) for 6 months.
    *   **Multibacillary (MB):** 3 drugs (Rifampicin, Clofazimine, Dapsone) for 12 months.

**C. Breaking the Chain of Transmission**
*   **Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP):** Administration of Single Dose **[[Rifampicin]]** (SDR) to eligible contacts of index cases,.
*   **Contact Tracing:** Screening household and social contacts.

**D. Disability Prevention and Medical Rehabilitation (DPMR)**
*   Providing **MCR (Microcellular Rubber)** footwear for anesthetic feet.
*   Reconstructive Surgery (RCS) for deformities.
*   **Welfare Allowance:** ₹8,000 paid to patients undergoing RCS.

**E. Reducing Stigma (IEC/BCC)**
*   **[[SPARSH Leprosy Awareness Campaign]]**: Launched to generate awareness and reduce discrimination,.
*   **Mascot:** **"Sapna"** is the mascot for NLEP to promote inclusion.

### 3. Barriers to Eradication (Why is it difficult?)
Leprosy is **not** easily amenable to total eradication (like Smallpox) due to several epidemiological factors.

**Mnemonic: "SLIPPER"** (Leprosy affects nerves/feet, hence slipper)
*   **S** - **S**ub-clinical cases (Iceberg phenomenon).
*   **L** - **L**ong and variable **[[Incubation Period]]** (3-5 years or more).
*   **I** - **I**mmunity failure (Cell-Mediated Immunity fails in Lepromatous cases).
*   **P** - **P**ersistence of bacteria (Persisters) and Drug Resistance.
*   **P** - **P**oor social acceptance (Stigma leads to concealment).
*   **E** - **E**xtra-human reservoir (e.g., Armadillos, Chimpanzees).
*   **R** - **R**esence of NO effective vaccine (BCG has variable efficacy).

### 4. Indicators for Monitoring Elimination
To assess if elimination is sustained, the following indicators are used:

| Indicator Type | Specific Indicator | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Impact Indicator** | **[[Prevalence Rate (PR)]]** | Measures case load. Target: <1/10,000,. |
| **Epidemiological** | **[[Annual New Case Detection Rate (ANCDR)]]** | Indicates transmission intensity,. |
| **Operational** | **[[Grade 2 Disability (G2D) Rate]]** | Indicates *delay* in diagnosis. Target: <1 per million population,. |
| **Operational** | **Treatment Completion Rate** | Measures program efficiency/adherence. |

### 5. Clinical Relevance: Diagnosis for Elimination
For elimination strategies to work, early diagnosis is vital. Health workers look for **Cardinal Signs**:

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> A flow chart showing the 3 cardinal signs leading to a diagnosis of Leprosy

1.  **Hypopigmented/Reddish patch** with **definite loss of sensation**.
2.  **Thickened/Enlarged peripheral nerves** with loss of sensation/muscle weakness.
3.  **Demonstration of AFB** (Acid Fast Bacilli) in skin smear.
    *(Presence of **any one** is diagnostic)*.
