# [[Communicable Diseases - Arthropod-Borne Infections]] > Leishmaniasis

**Leishmaniasis** (Kala-Azar / Visceral Leishmaniasis)

### **1. Problem Statement**
*   **Definition:** It is a chronic, systemic disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus *Leishmania*. In India, it is primarily **Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL)**, locally known as **Kala-Azar** (Black Sickness) due to the characteristic darkening of the skin.
*   **Public Health Importance:** It is a major public health problem in India, particularly endemic in Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh.
*   **Elimination Goal:** The goal is to reduce the prevalence to less than **1 case per 10,000 population** at the block level.

### **2. Epidemiological Triad**

| Component | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Agent** | **[[Leishmania donovani]]** (Protozoa). <br> • **Amastigote form:** Found in humans (LD bodies). <br> • **Promastigote form:** Found in Sandfly (Flagellated). |
| **Vector** | **[[Phlebotomus argentipes]]** (Sandfly). <br> • **Habit:** Nocturnal, hops (cannot fly), rests in cracks/crevices of walls. <br> • **Anthrophilic:** Prefers human blood. |
| **Reservoir** | **Man is the sole reservoir** in India (Non-zoonotic). <br> *Note: In other countries (e.g., Mediterranean), dogs are reservoirs (Zoonotic).* |

---

### **3. Host Factors**
*   **Age:** Affects all ages, but peak incidence in India is **5–9 years**.
*   **Gender:** Males are affected twice as often as females.
*   **Socio-economic Status:** Disease of the **"poorest of the poor"**; associated with mud houses, damp floors, and vegetation near houses.
*   **Immunity:** Recovery confers lasting immunity. [[Cell-Mediated Immunity]] (CMI) is depressed during active disease.

---

### **4. Transmission**
*   **Vector-Borne:** Bite of infective female phlebotomine sandfly (*P. argentipes*).
*   **Other Modes:**
    *   Blood transfusion.
    *   Congenital transfer (vertical transmission).
    *   Accidental inoculation (laboratory workers).
    *   Contaminated needles.

---

### **5. Incubation Period**
*   **Range:** 10 days to 2 years.
*   **Average:** **1 to 4 months**.

---

### **6. Clinical Features**
The clinical presentation is often termed the **"Kala-Azar Syndrome"**.

*   **Fever:** Continuous or remittent, often with a **double rise of temperature** in 24 hours.
*   **Splenomegaly:** Massive enlargement (often reaching the iliac fossa); soft initially, becomes hard later.
*   **Hepatomegaly:** Liver enlargement (less marked than spleen).
*   **Skin Changes:** Dry, rough, and dark pigmented skin (hence *Black Sickness*).
*   **[[Pancytopenia]]:** Anemia, Leukopenia, and Thrombocytopenia.
*   **Weight Loss:** Progressive emaciation/wasting.
*   **Lymphadenopathy:** Present in some cases.

---

### **7. Post Kala-Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis ([[PKDL]])**
*   **Definition:** A cutaneous condition appearing **1-2 years after** the apparent cure of Kala-Azar.
*   **Lesions:** Hypopigmented macules, papules, or nodules (usually on the face and trunk).
*   **Importance:** These patients act as a **major reservoir** of infection during inter-epidemic periods because the skin lesions are rich in parasites.

### **8. Diagnosis**

| Test | Utility | Remarks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[rK39 Dipstick Test]]** | **Screening/Field Diagnosis** | Rapid immunochromatographic test. High sensitivity/specificity. **Test of choice in program**. |
| **Parasitology (Microscopy)** | **Confirmatory (Gold Standard)** | Demonstration of **LD Bodies** (Amastigotes) in aspirates of **Spleen** (most sensitive), Bone Marrow, or Lymph nodes. |
| **Aldehyde Test (Napier)** | **Surveillance** | Non-specific. Positive 2-3 months after onset. Detects hypergammaglobulinemia. |
| **Leishmanin Test (Montenegro)** | **Epidemiological** | Skin test for delayed hypersensitivity. **Negative** in active Kala-Azar. **Positive** after cure (6-8 weeks). |

**Clinical Relevance:** Do not perform splenic aspiration if prothrombin time is prolonged or platelet count is very low (risk of fatal hemorrhage).

### **9. Treatment**

**Specific Antileishmanial Therapy (Indian National Guidelines 2017)**:

1.  **First Line (Treatment of Choice):**
    *   **[[Liposomal Amphotericin B]] (LAMB):** Single dose **10 mg/kg** IV infusion.
    *   *Why?* Highest cure rate, single encounter, safe in pregnancy.

2.  **Second Line/Alternatives:**
    *   **Miltefosine:** Oral drug (100 mg/day for 28 days). *Contraindicated in pregnancy/lactation*.
    *   **Paromomycin:** IM injection (for 21 days).
    *   **Amphotericin B Deoxycholate:** Given in multiple doses (requires hospitalization due to renal toxicity).

3.  **Treatment of PKDL:**
    *   **Miltefosine** for 12 weeks OR Liposomal Amphotericin B.

*Mnemonic for Treatment:* **"LAMB is the Boss"** (Liposomal Amphotericin B is the drug of choice).

### **10. Prevention and Control**

**A. Vector Control**
*   **IRS (Indoor Residual Spraying):** Using **[[DDT]]** (Dichloro-Diphenyl-Trichloroethane) up to **6 feet height** from the floor (as sandflies are low fliers and hop).
*   **Environmental Management:** Filling cracks/crevices (breeding sites), sanitation, moving cattle sheds away from human dwellings.

**B. Reservoir Control**
*   **Active Case Detection:** Door-to-door search (e.g., during "Kala-Azar Fortnight").
*   **Early Treatment:** Complete treatment of all cases (including PKDL) to break the chain of transmission.

**C. Personal Prophylaxis**
*   Use of **[[Insecticide Treated Nets]] (ITNs)** or Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs).
*   Wearing protective clothing.
*   *Note:* No chemoprophylaxis is available for Kala-Azar.

**D. Vaccination**
*   Currently, **no vaccine** is available for human use.
