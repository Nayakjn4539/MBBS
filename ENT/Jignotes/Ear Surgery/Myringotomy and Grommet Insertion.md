# [[Ear Surgery]] > Myringotomy and Grommet Insertion

### Myringotomy and Grommet Insertion

**Myringotomy** (also known as Tympanotomy or Paracentesis tympani) is the surgical incision of the [[tympanic membrane]] to drain middle ear fluid (suppurative or non-suppurative) or to provide aeration in cases of [[Eustachian tube]] dysfunction.

**Grommet Insertion** (Myringotomy with ventilation tube) involves placing a small tube through the incision to maintain aeration and drainage for a prolonged period.

### Indications

**1. Acute Suppurative Otitis Media ([[ASOM]])**
*   **Bulging Tympanic Membrane:** Severe earache with a bulging drum [].
*   **Incomplete Resolution:** Persistent conductive deafness and opaque drum despite antibiotics [].
*   **Complications:** To drain pus in cases of [[facial nerve palsy]], [[labyrinthitis]], or [[meningitis]] associated with AOM [,].
*   **Recurrent AOM:** To prevent frequent episodes [].

**2. Otitis Media with Effusion ([[OME]] / Glue Ear)**
*   Chronic effusion persisting > 3 months (chronic OME) [,].
*   Hearing loss > 25–30 dB in the better ear [].
*   **Atelectatic Ear:** To provide long-term aeration and prevent retraction pockets [,].

**3. Aero-otitis Media (Barotrauma)**
*   To drain hemotympanum or fluid and "unlock" the Eustachian tube [,].

---

### Contraindications
*   **Intratympanic [[Glomus Tumor]]:** Myringotomy can cause profuse, life-threatening bleeding if a red mass behind the drum is actually a glomus tumor [].

---

### Anesthesia and Patient Preparation

*   **Infants/Children:** General Anesthesia (GA) is mandatory [,].
*   **Adults:**
    *   **Local Anesthesia (LA):** Used if the TM is not acutely inflamed. Agents include phenol, EMLA cream, or Xylocaine spray [,,].
    *   **No Anesthesia:** Possible in non-inflamed ears in cooperative adults [].
    *   **General Anesthesia:** Required if the TM is acutely inflamed and painful [].

---

### Instrumentation
*   **[[Operating Microscope]]:** Essential for magnification and depth perception [,].
*   **[[Myringotome]]:** A sharp, sickle-shaped knife used to incise the TM [,].
*   **Suction tip:** To aspirate fluid/pus (e.g., [[Zollner suction tip]]).
*   **Grommet (Ventilation tube):** If insertion is planned.

### Surgical Technique

The procedure varies slightly based on the pathology (ASOM vs. OME).

#### 1. Site of Incision
*   **[[Posteroinferior Quadrant]] (PIQ):** Preferred for **[[ASOM]]**.
    *   *Reason:* It is the safest area, midway between the handle of [[malleus]] and the annulus. It avoids injury to the ossicular chain ([[incus]], [[stapes]]) and [[chorda tympani]] nerve [,,].
    *   *Incision Shape:* **Curvilinear or Circumferential**. This cuts across fibers, keeping the opening patent for drainage [,].
*   **[[Anteroinferior Quadrant]] (AIQ):** Preferred for **[[OME]]** (Grommet insertion).
    *   *Reason:* It simulates the physiological position of the Eustachian tube, is less vascular, and allows the grommet to stay longer (due to epithelial migration pattern) [,,].
    *   *Incision Shape:* **Radial**. This separates fibers rather than cutting them, helping the drum grip the grommet tightly [,].

#### 2. The "Beer Can" Principle
*   In cases of **Glue Ear (OME)** with very thick, glue-like fluid, a single incision may not suffice for aspiration.
*   **Technique:** A second incision is made in the **Anterosuperior quadrant**. This allows air to enter the middle ear (ventilation), breaking the vacuum and facilitating the suction of thick fluid through the primary inferior incision [,].

#### 3. Grommet Insertion
*   The grommet is held with forceps and the inner flange is tilted and inserted through the myringotomy incision [].
*   **Function:** It acts as a ventilation tube, bypassing the Eustachian tube to equalize pressure and drain secretions [].

### Types of Grommets (Ventilation Tubes)

| Type | Material | Duration of Stay | Examples | Clinical Indication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Short-term** | Teflon/Silicone | < 6 months | Shepard, Donaldson | First-line for OME [,] |
| **Mid-term** | Teflon/Silicone | 6–12 months | Shah, Armstrong, Paparella | Recurrent OME [,] |
| **Long-term** | Silicone/Titanium | > 1 year | **[[T-tube]]** (Goode), Per Lee | Chronic atelectasis, multiple extrusions [,] |

### Complications

#### Intra-operative
1.  **Injury to Ossicles:** Dislocation of the incudostapedial joint (especially with posterosuperior incisions) [,].
2.  **Bleeding:** Injury to a high-riding [[jugular bulb]] if the floor of the middle ear is dehiscent [,].
3.  **Chorda Tympani Injury:** Leading to taste disturbance.

#### Post-operative / Late
1.  **[[Otorrhea]]:** Most common complication (infection via the tube) [,].
2.  **[[Myringosclerosis]] (Tympanosclerosis):** Calcification/scarring of the TM at the insertion site [,,].
3.  **Persistent Perforation:** The hole may fail to close after the tube extrudes [,].
4.  **Granuloma formation:** Around the tube [].
5.  **Cholesteatoma:** Due to implantation of squamous epithelium [].
6.  **Early Extrusion:** Tube falls out too soon.
7.  **Medial Migration:** Tube falls *into* the middle ear [,].

---

### Post-Operative Care
*   **Water Precautions:** Keep ears dry. Use earplugs while bathing. Swimming is generally discouraged or requires protection, though some studies show no difference in infection rates [,,].
*   **Follow-up:** Regular check-ups to monitor tube position and hearing status.
*   **Extrusion:** Grommets usually extrude spontaneously due to the migratory property of the TM epithelium (usually in 6-12 months for short-term tubes) [,].

### Funny Mnemonics for Incision Sites

*   **A** for **A**eration: **A**nteroinferior quadrant (for **Grommet/OME**).
*   **P** for **P**us: **P**osteroinferior quadrant (for **ASOM**).

*   **P**revent **S**tupidity in **M**edicine (**PSM**): Never incise the **P**ostero-**S**uperior **M**argin/Quadrant.
    *   *Why?* Risk to **I**ncus, **C**horda tympani, **O**val window, **F**acial nerve (**ICOF**).
