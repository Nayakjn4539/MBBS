# [[Strabismus (Squint)]] > Laws of Ocular Motility

### Laws of Ocular Motility

The coordination of [[ocular movements]] is governed by two fundamental neurological laws. These laws dictate how nerve impulses are distributed to the [[extraocular muscles]] (EOM) to ensure smooth, synchronized movement of the eyes. Understanding these laws is critical for diagnosing and managing [[strabismus]], particularly [[paralytic squint]].

### 1. Sherrington’s Law of Reciprocal Innervation

This law governs the innervation of **antagonistic muscles** within the **same eye**.

*   **Definition:** During the initiation of an eye movement, increased innervation (contraction) to an [[agonist muscle]] is automatically associated with a simultaneous and reciprocal decrease in innervation (relaxation) of its direct [[antagonist muscle]] in the same eye.
*   **Key Concept:** Reciprocal Inhibition.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   When a signal is sent to the agonist to contract, an inhibitory signal is sent to the antagonist to relax.
    *   This prevents the muscles from fighting against each other, allowing smooth rotation of the [[globe]].

#### Example: Horizontal Gaze (Dextroversion/Right Gaze)
*   **Right Eye:** To look right, the **Right [[Lateral Rectus]] (Agonist)** receives increased innervation to contract. Simultaneously, the **Right [[Medial Rectus]] (Antagonist)** receives decreased innervation to relax.
*   **Left Eye:** The **Left [[Medial Rectus]] (Agonist)** contracts, while the **Left [[Lateral Rectus]] (Antagonist)** relaxes.

#### Clinical Implications
1.  **[[Duane's Retraction Syndrome]]:** This condition violates Sherrington's Law. There is paradoxical co-contraction of the [[medial rectus]] and [[lateral rectus]] upon adduction, causing the globe to retract into the orbit.
2.  **[[Nystagmus]]:** Rhythmic oscillation occurs when this reciprocal relationship is disturbed.

### 2. Hering’s Law of Equal Innervation

This law governs the innervation of **yoke muscles** (contralateral synergists) in **binocular movements**.

*   **Definition:** During any conjugate eye movement (versions) or disjugate movement (vergences), an equal and simultaneous flow of innervation (nerve impulse) is sent from the brain to the pair of [[yoke muscles]].
*   **Key Concept:** Bilateral symmetry of innervation.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   The eyes are yoked together; the brain does not control muscles individually but controls movements.
    *   The amount of innervation sent to both eyes is determined by the **fixating eye**.

#### Example: Dextroversion (Looking Right)
*   The **Right [[Lateral Rectus]]** and the **Left [[Medial Rectus]]** are yoke muscles.
*   To look to the right, the brain sends an **equal** signal to both these muscles to contract simultaneously.

#### Clinical Implications: Paralytic Squint
Hering's Law explains the difference between **Primary** and **Secondary Deviation** in [[incomitant strabismus]] (paralytic squint).

*   **Primary Deviation:** Deviation of the squinting eye when the **normal eye** is fixing.
    *   The normal eye requires a normal amount of innervation to fixate.
    *   By Hering's law, the same normal amount is sent to the paretic muscle.
    *   Because the muscle is paretic, it responds poorly, resulting in a specific angle of deviation.

*   **Secondary Deviation:** Deviation of the normal eye when the **paretic eye** is fixing.
    *   The paretic eye requires **excessive innervation** to maintain fixation (because the muscle is weak).
    *   By Hering's law, this **excessive** innervation is transmitted to the healthy yoke muscle in the other eye.
    *   The healthy muscle over-responds, causing a massive deviation of the normal eye.
*   **Result:** **Secondary Deviation > Primary Deviation**.

### Comparison of Laws

| Feature | Sherrington's Law | Hering's Law |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scope** | Monocular (One eye) | Binocular (Both eyes) |
| **Muscles Involved** | Agonist and Antagonist (Same eye) | Yoke Muscles (Contralateral eyes) |
| **Mechanism** | Reciprocal Innervation (Contraction + Relaxation) | Equal Innervation (Simultaneous Contraction) |
| **Main Application** | Smooth ocular rotation; [[Ductions]] | Conjugate movements ([[Versions]]); [[Vergences]] |
| **Clinical Sign** | Co-contraction (Duane's Syndrome) | Secondary Deviation > Primary Deviation |

### Pathological Sequelae of Muscle Palsy
Based on these laws, specific changes occur over time following a single muscle paralysis (e.g., Right [[Lateral Rectus]] Palsy):

1.  **Overaction of the Contralateral Synergist (Yoke Muscle):** Due to Hering's law. (e.g., Left [[Medial Rectus]] overaction).
2.  **Contracture of the Direct Antagonist:** Due to unopposed action and lack of stretching. (e.g., Right [[Medial Rectus]] contracture).
3.  **Secondary Inhibitional Palsy:** The contralateral antagonist appears paretic because the fixating eye drives the deviation. (e.g., Left [[Lateral Rectus]] appears weak).

### Mnemonics

*   **S**herrington = **S**ame eye (**S**haring signals between agonist/antagonist).
*   **H**ering = **H**usband and wife (Yoke muscles/Couple) working together equally.
*   **P**aralytic **S**quint: **S**econdary deviation is **S**uperior (Greater).
