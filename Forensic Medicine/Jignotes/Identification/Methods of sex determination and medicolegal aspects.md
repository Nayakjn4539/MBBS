# [[Identification]] > Methods of sex determination and medicolegal aspects

**Sex determination** is a crucial aspect of [[Identification]] (fixation of partial identity) in both civil and criminal cases. It is the first step in the identification of skeletal remains.

### I. Methods of Sex Determination

The determination of sex can be broadly classified into morphological, osteological, microscopic, and chemical methods.

#### 1. Examination of Living Persons / Fresh Bodies
In living individuals or fresh corpses, sex is determined by inspecting the **secondary sexual characteristics** and genital organs.

*   **Males:**
    *   Development of facial hair (mustache, beard).
    *   Prominent Adam's apple (thyroid cartilage).
    *   Android pelvis (narrow hips).
    *   Pubic hair distribution: Rhomboidal (extends towards umbilicus).
    *   Voice: Low pitched (after puberty).
*   **Females:**
    *   Development of breasts.
    *   Absence of facial hair; smooth face.
    *   Gynecoid pelvis (broad hips).
    *   Pubic hair distribution: Triangular (horizontal upper border).
    *   Voice: High pitched.

#### 2. Examination of Decomposed/Mutilated Bodies (Internal)
When external features are lost due to [[Putrefaction]] or mutilation, internal organs aid identification.
*   **Uterus:** In females, the non-gravid uterus is the **last organ to putrefy** (highly resistant). It can identify sex even in advanced decomposition.
*   **Prostate:** In males, the prostate gland resists putrefaction for a long time.
*   **Gonads:** Presence of ovaries or testes (confirmed by histopathology) gives positive identification.

#### 3. Osteological Examination (Skeleton)
Bones are the most vital evidence for sex determination in skeletal remains. Accuracy depends on the number of bones available (**Krogman’s Accuracy**):
*   **Entire Skeleton:** 100%
*   **Pelvis alone:** 95% (Most reliable single bone)
*   **Skull alone:** 90–92%
*   **Pelvis + Skull:** 98%
*   **Long bones:** 80–85%

**A. The Pelvis**
The pelvis is the most reliable bone because it is adapted for child-bearing in females.

| Feature | Male Pelvis | Female Pelvis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **General Appearance** | Heavy, rough, massive, prominent muscle markings | Light, smooth, less massive |
| **Pelvic Inlet (Brim)** | Heart-shaped | Circular or Elliptical |
| **Pelvic Cavity** | Funnel-shaped, deep | Cylindrical, shallow, roomy |
| **Sub-pubic Angle** | V-shaped, Acute (< 90°) | U-shaped, Obtuse (> 90°) |
| **Greater Sciatic Notch** | Narrow, deep ("J" shaped) | Wide, shallow ("L" shaped) |
| **Pre-auricular Sulcus** | Rare/Shallow | Frequently present, deep (attachment of sacroiliac ligament) |
| **Obturator Foramen** | Large, oval | Small, triangular |
| **Sacrum** | Long, narrow, uniformly curved | Short, wide, flat upper part |
| **Acetabulum** | Large, directed laterally | Small, directed anterolaterally |
| **Ischial Tuberosity** | Inverted | Everted |

*   **Important Indices for Pelvis:**
    *   **Sciatic Notch Index:** Width × 100 / Depth. (4–5 in males; 5–6 in females).
    *   **Ischio-pubic Index (Washburn):** Pubis length × 100 / Ischium length. (73–94 in males; 91–115 in females).
    *   **Chilotic Line:** In females, the pelvic production of the line is greater than the sacral part.

**B. The Skull**
Skull features are reliable only after puberty.

| Feature | Male Skull | Female Skull |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **General Size** | Larger, heavier, rugged | Smaller, lighter, smooth |
| **Glabella** | Prominent | Smooth/Flat |
| **Supraorbital Ridges** | Prominent | Less prominent/Absent |
| **Frontal Eminence** | Small/Indistinct | Prominent |
| **Mastoid Process** | Large, blunt, rough | Small, pointed, smooth |
| **Orbital Margins** | Rounded, blunt edges | Sharp edges |
| **Muscle Attachments** | Prominent (Occipital protuberance) | Less marked |
| **Digastric Groove** | Deep | Shallow |

**Mnemonic for Skull:** **M**ale **M**astoid is **M**assive.

**C. The Sternum (Ashley’s Rule of 149)**
*   **Rule:** The total length of the sternum (Manubrium + Body).
    *   **Male:** > 149 mm
    *   **Female:** < 149 mm

**D. Long Bones**
Generally, male bones are heavier, longer, and have more prominent muscle attachment sites. The **Femur** and **Humerus** are most useful.
*   **Femur Head Diameter:** > 48 mm in males; < 44 mm in females.

#### 4. Microscopic / Cytological Methods (Nuclear Sexing)
Used when only tissues/blood are available or in ambiguous genitalia.

*   **Barr Body (Sex Chromatin):**
    *   Found in epithelial cells (e.g., buccal smear), cartilage, skin.
    *   Appears as a plano-convex mass near the nuclear membrane.
    *   **Female (XX):** Present (Positive) in 20–80% of cells.
    *   **Male (XY):** Absent (Negative).
    *   *Note:* Cannot be detected in decomposed bodies.

*   **Davidson Body (Neutrophil Drumstick):**
    *   Small nuclear attachment (drumstick form) in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (Neutrophils).
    *   **Female:** Present in up to 6% of neutrophils.
    *   **Male:** Absent.

*   **Y-Fluorescence (F-Body):**
    *   Staining with **Quinacrine mustard**.
    *   Y-chromosome fluoresces brightly.
    *   Positive in Males.

#### 5. Advanced Methods
*   **[[DNA Profiling]]:** Analysis of the **Amelogenin gene** via PCR. This is definitive and can be used on fragmented remains, teeth, or fluid stains.
*   **Dental Methods:** Males generally have larger teeth than females (canine width is often used), but considerable overlap exists.

### II. Medicolegal Aspects of Sex Determination

Sex determination is vital in both civil and criminal scenarios.

1.  **Identification:**
    *   Essential for establishing the identity of unknown bodies, decomposed remains, or skeletal remains found in suspicious circumstances.
    *   In **Mass Disasters** (plane crashes, explosions), separating commingled remains relies heavily on sexing.

2.  **Marriage and Divorce:**
    *   Marriage is a contract between a male and a female. Concealment of sex (or [[Intersex]] conditions) can be grounds for annulment or divorce.

3.  **Legitimacy and Inheritance:**
    *   In cases of **Suppositious Child** (faking pregnancy and producing a borrowed child), sex determination of the child is required if the inheritance depends on gender (common in ancient laws or specific wills).

4.  **Sexual Offences:**
    *   **Rape:** By definition (IPC 375), rape is an offence usually committed by a man against a woman (though definitions are evolving). Determination of sex is crucial in cases involving transsexuals or intersex individuals.
    *   **Unnatural Offences (Sodomy):** Can be committed against males or females.

5.  **Impersonation:**
    *   Individuals may disguise themselves as the opposite sex for criminal purposes, escaping custody, or inheritance fraud.
