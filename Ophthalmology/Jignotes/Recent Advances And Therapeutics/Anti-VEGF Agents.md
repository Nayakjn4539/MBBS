# [[Recent Advances And Therapeutics]] > Anti-VEGF Agents

### Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (Anti-VEGF) Agents

**[[Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor]] (VEGF)**, specifically VEGF-A, is the pivotal cytokine responsible for ocular angiogenesis and vascular permeability. In pathological conditions like ischemia or inflammation, VEGF levels rise, leading to neovascularization and macular edema. Anti-VEGF agents block these molecules, thereby inhibiting new vessel growth and reducing leakage,.

#### Mechanism of Action
*   **Target:** VEGF-A (The most abundant isoform is VEGF-165).
*   **Action:** These drugs bind to VEGF molecules, preventing them from binding to their receptors on endothelial cells.
*   **Result:**
    *   Regression of neovascularization.
    *   Reduction in vascular permeability (decreases [[Macular Edema]]).
    *   Inhibition of angiogenesis.

#### Classification of Anti-VEGF Agents

These agents have revolutionized the management of retinal vascular diseases.

| Drug Name | Trade Name | Nature/Structure | Mechanism | Dose & Volume | FDA Status/Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Pegaptanib Sodium]]** | Macugen | Pegylated **Aptamer** (Oligonucleotide) | Binds specifically to **VEGF-165 isoform** only. | 0.3 mg in 0.09 mL | Limited efficacy compared to newer agents. |
| **[[Bevacizumab]]** | Avastin | Full-length recombinant humanized **Monoclonal Antibody** (IgG1) | Binds to **all isoforms** of VEGF-A. | 1.25 mg in 0.05 mL | **Off-label** use (originally for colorectal cancer). Cost-effective., |
| **[[Ranibizumab]]** | Lucentis | Humanized Monoclonal **Antibody Fragment** (Fab) | Binds to **all isoforms** of VEGF-A. Smaller molecule, better penetration. | 0.5 mg in 0.05 mL | FDA approved. Produced by *E. coli*. Short half-life. |
| **[[Aflibercept]]** | Eylea | **Fusion Protein** (VEGF Trap) | Soluble **decoy receptor** (fuses VEGF receptor domains with IgG). Binds VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and PlGF. | 2.0 mg in 0.05 mL | Longer duration of action. Requires fewer injections., |
| **[[Brolucizumab]]** | Beovu | Humanized single-chain antibody fragment | High affinity for all VEGF-A isoforms. | 6 mg in 0.05 mL | Newer agent. |

> **Clinical Insight:** **Bevacizumab** is a much larger molecule (149 kD) compared to **Ranibizumab** (48 kD). While Bevacizumab is used off-label, it is widely popular in developing countries due to its significantly lower cost compared to FDA-approved alternatives,.

#### Indications
Anti-VEGF agents are currently the **first-line therapy** for many retinal vascular disorders.

**1. [[Age-Related Macular Degeneration]] (Wet ARMD)**
*   **Role:** Standard of care for **Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV)**.
*   **Outcome:** Improves vision in 30–40% of cases and stabilizes vision in >90% of cases.
*   **Regimen:** Monthly injections or "Treat and Extend" protocols.

**2. [[Diabetic Retinopathy]]**
*   **Diabetic Macular Edema (DME):** Drug of choice for center-involving DME.
*   **Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR):** Causes regression of neovascularization (NVD/NVE). Often used as an adjunct before **Pan-retinal Photocoagulation (PRP)** or Vitrectomy to reduce intraoperative bleeding.

**3. Retinal Vein Occlusions ([[CRVO]]/[[BRVO]])**
*   Used to treat associated **Cystoid Macular Edema (CME)**.
*   Reduces neovascularization.

**4. [[Retinopathy of Prematurity]] (ROP)**
*   Used for Zone 1 or posterior Zone 2 disease (e.g., Bevacizumab or Ranibizumab) as an alternative to laser, allowing for continued retinal vascularization.

**5. Other Indications:**
*   **[[Neovascular Glaucoma]] (NVG):** Causes regression of rubeosis iridis (new vessels on iris).
*   **Myopic CNV:** (Pathological Myopia).
*   **[[Eales Disease]]**: For recurrent vitreous hemorrhage.
*   **Choroidal Osteoma & Juxtafoveal Telangiectasia**.
*   **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR):** Used if CNV develops.

#### Mode of Administration
*   **Route:** **Intravitreal Injection** (Pars Plana injection).
*   **Site:**
    *   **Phakic eyes:** 4.0 mm posterior to the limbus.
    *   **Pseudophakic/Aphakic eyes:** 3.0 - 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus.
*   **Procedure:** Performed under strict aseptic conditions (using Povidone-Iodine) to prevent endophthalmitis.

#### Complications
Although generally safe, intravitreal injections carry risks:

**Ocular Complications:**
*   **[[Endophthalmitis]]** (Most dreaded, incidence <0.05%).
*   **Traumatic Cataract** (lens touch during injection).
*   **Retinal Detachment** (Rhegmatogenous).
*   **Vitreous Hemorrhage**.
*   **Sustained IOP rise** (Glaucoma).

**Systemic Complications (Rare):**
*   Potential risk of thromboembolic events (Stroke, MI) due to systemic absorption (theoretical concern, especially with Bevacizumab).

#### Recent Advances & Future Directions
1.  **Anti-PDGF Therapy:** Resistance to anti-VEGF therapy is often due to **Pericytes** protecting the new vessels. Combining Anti-PDGF (Platelet Derived Growth Factor) with Anti-VEGF agents strips the pericytes, making the neovascular complex more vulnerable to treatment.
2.  **Sustained Release Implants:** To reduce the burden of frequent injections (e.g., Port Delivery Systems).
3.  **Biosimilars:** Cost-effective alternatives to proprietary drugs like Ranibizumab.
