# [[ENVIRONMENT & HEALTH]] > Biological treatment of sewage

### Biological Treatment of Sewage

Biological treatment is the core component of **Secondary Treatment** in modern sewage purification. Its primary objective is the **"Stabilization"** or **"Mineralization"** of organic matter found in the effluent coming from primary sedimentation.

This process utilizes living microorganisms (bacteria, algae, fungi, protozoa) to decompose complex organic substances into simpler, stable end-products like Carbon Dioxide, Water, Nitrates, and Sulphates.

#### 1. Principles of Biological Treatment
The decomposition occurs via two main natural processes:
*   **Aerobic Process:** Requires continuous oxygen. Efficient breakdown of organic matter by aerobic bacteria. Used in *Activated Sludge* and *Trickling Filters*.
*   **Anaerobic Process:** Occurs in the absence of oxygen. Used for [[Sludge Digestion]] and in *Septic Tanks*. End products include Methane and Ammonia.

#### 2. Main Methods of Biological Treatment

The two most common methods employed in modern sewage treatment plants are:

**A. Trickling Filter Method (Percolating Filter)**
*   **Concept:** The term "Filter" is a misnomer; the action is purely **biological**, not mechanical filtration.
*   **Structure:** It consists of a bed of crushed stones or clinker (1–2 meters deep).
*   **Mechanism:**
    1.  Effluent from the primary sedimentation tank is sprinkled uniformly over the bed using rotating hollow pipes.
    2.  As the effluent trickles down, a complex biological growth forms on the stones, known as the **[[Zoogleal Layer]]**.
    3.  **Zoogleal Layer:** This slimy film contains algae, fungi, protozoa, and bacteria. It consumes the organic matter and oxidizes it.
    4.  **Humus:** As the biological layer dies, it sloughs off and is washed down as a flocculent material called "humus," which is later removed in secondary sedimentation tanks.
*   **Ventilation:** No rest pauses are needed; air circulates naturally through the gaps in the stones to supply oxygen.

**B. Activated Sludge Process**
*   **Concept:** This is the modern, more efficient method suited for larger cities.
*   **Heart of the Process:** The **[[Aeration Tank]]**.
*   **Mechanism:**
    1.  Primary effluent is mixed with "Return Sludge" (sludge drawn from the final settling tank).
    2.  This return sludge is called **[[Activated Sludge]]** because it is a rich culture of aerobic bacteria.
    3.  **Aeration:** The mixture is aerated for 6–8 hours using mechanical agitation or compressed air (diffused aeration).
    4.  **Result:** Organic matter is rapidly oxidized into CO2, nitrates, and water. Pathogens like Typhoid and Cholera bacteria are destroyed.
*   **Efficiency:** One acre of Activated Sludge plant does the work of 10 acres of Trickling Filters.

#### 3. Other Biological Methods

**C. Oxidation Ponds (Waste Stabilization Ponds)**
*   **Principle:** **Symbiosis** between Algae and Bacteria.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **Bacteria:** Metabolize organic waste and release CO2 and Ammonia.
    *   **Algae:** Use the CO2 + Sunlight (Photosynthesis) to grow and release **Oxygen**.
    *   **Oxygen:** Is used back by bacteria for oxidation.
*   **Nature:** Predominantly aerobic during the day; bottom layers may be anaerobic at night.
*   **Use:** Low cost, suitable for small communities and tropical climates with abundant sunlight.

**D. Septic Tank**
*   Used for individual households.
*   **Primary Action:** **Anaerobic Digestion** occurs inside the tank (solids settle as sludge, lighter grease floats as scum).
*   **Secondary Action:** **Aerobic Oxidation** occurs *outside* the tank when the effluent percolates into the sub-soil via soak pits.

#### 4. Comparison of Modern Biological Methods

| Feature | Trickling Filter | Activated Sludge Process |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mechanism** | Biological film (Zoogleal layer) | Aerated bacterial culture |
| **Space Required** | More area needed | Less space (compact) |
| **Operation Skill** | Less skilled labor required | Highly skilled operation required |
| **Efficiency** | Very efficient | **More efficient** than Trickling Filter |
| **Sensitivity** | Resistant to shock loads | Sensitive to changes in flow/quality |
| **Suitability** | Smaller towns | Large cities |

#### 5. Evaluation of Biological Treatment (Indicators)
The efficiency of biological treatment is measured by the reduction in **[[Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)]]**.
*   **BOD:** The amount of oxygen absorbed by a sample of sewage during a specific period (usually 5 days at 20°C) for aerobic destruction of organic matter.
*   **Strong Sewage:** BOD > 300 mg/L.
*   **Weak Sewage:** BOD < 100 mg/L.
*   Effective biological treatment significantly lowers BOD, rendering the effluent safe for discharge into water bodies or for irrigation.

### Mnemonic
To remember the components of the **Zoogleal Layer** in Trickling Filters:
**"FAB P"**
*   **F**ungi
*   **A**lgae
*   **B**acteria
*   **P**rotozoa

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Disease Prevention:** Improperly treated sewage is the source of the Fecal-Oral route of transmission. Biological treatment significantly reduces the load of pathogenic bacteria (e.g., *Vibrio cholerae*, *Salmonella typhi*) and viruses (Polio, Hepatitis A/E).
*   **Vector Control:** Properly managed biological treatment (like mosquito-free oxidation ponds) prevents breeding of Culex mosquitoes, which transmit [[Filariasis]] and Japanese Encephalitis.
