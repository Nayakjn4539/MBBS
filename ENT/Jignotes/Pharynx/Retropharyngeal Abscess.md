# [[Pharynx]] > Retropharyngeal Abscess

[[Retropharyngeal abscess]] is a collection of pus in the retropharyngeal space. It is the most common deep neck space infection in children but can occur in adults due to penetrating injuries,.

### **Anatomy of [[Retropharyngeal Space]]**
*   **Synonyms:** Posterior visceral space, retrovisceral space, retroesophageal space, **Space of Gillette**,.
*   **Extent:** Extends from the [[skull base]] superiorly to the bifurcation of the [[trachea]] (mediastinum/T4) inferiorly,.
*   **Boundaries:**
    *   **Anterior:** [[Buccopharyngeal fascia]] covering the pharyngeal constrictor muscles,.
    *   **Posterior:** [[Alar fascia]] and [[prevertebral fascia]] covering the prevertebral muscles and cervical vertebrae,.
    *   **Lateral:** [[Carotid sheath]] and [[parapharyngeal space]],.
    *   **Medial:** A midline fibrous raphe divides this space into two lateral compartments (spaces of Gillette),,.
*   **Contents:** Loose areolar tissue and [[retropharyngeal lymph nodes]] (Nodes of Rouviere and Krause). These nodes drain the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and sinuses but usually disappear/atrophy by 3–4 years of age,,,.
*   **Clinical Significance:**
    *   Because of the midline raphe, an acute abscess typically presents as a **unilateral paramedian bulge**,,.
    *   The space communicates with the [[superior mediastinum]], acting as a pathway for infection spread (known as "Lincoln's Highway"),.

### **Etiology and Types**

#### **1. Acute Retropharyngeal Abscess**
*   **Age:** Common in children (infants and young children < 3–5 years) due to the presence of retropharyngeal lymph nodes,,.
*   **Causes:**
    *   **Children:** Suppuration of [[retropharyngeal lymph nodes]] secondary to infection in the adenoids, nasopharynx, sinuses, or tonsils (e.g., adenoiditis, tonsillitis),,.
    *   **Adults:** Usually due to penetrating injury to the posterior pharyngeal wall (e.g., fish bone ingestion, instrumentation/endoscopy),,.

#### **2. Chronic Retropharyngeal Abscess**
*   **Age:** Common in adults.
*   **Causes:**
    *   **Tuberculosis of Cervical Spine ([[Pott's spine]]):** Infection tracks behind the prevertebral fascia (technically a [[prevertebral abscess]]) and presents centrally,.
    *   **TB of Retropharyngeal Nodes:** Secondary to tuberculosis of deep cervical nodes; presents laterally,.

### **Clinical Features**

#### **Symptoms**
*   **Dysphagia/Odynophagia:** Difficulty or pain in swallowing is a prominent symptom,.
*   **Respiratory Distress:** [[Stridor]] and croupy cough due to laryngeal edema or anterior displacement of the posterior pharyngeal wall obstructing the airway,,.
*   **Systemic signs:** Fever, toxemia, and irritability,,.
*   **Neck Stiffness:** [[Torticollis]] (head held extended and stiff) due to spasm of prevertebral muscles,,.

#### **Signs**
*   **Pharyngeal Bulge:**
    *   **Acute:** A smooth, fluctuant swelling on the posterior pharyngeal wall, usually on **one side of the midline** (paramedian),,.
    *   **Chronic:** Often a midline bulge.
*   **Palpation:** Fluctuations may be elicited (care must be taken to prevent rupture and aspiration).
*   **Lymphadenopathy:** Enlarged cervical lymph nodes.

### **Investigations**

#### **1. X-ray Soft Tissue Neck (Lateral View)**
*   **Widening of prevertebral shadow:**
    *   Normal width at C2: < 7 mm (both children and adults),.
    *   Normal width at C6: < 14 mm in children; < 22 mm in adults,,.
    *   Widening indicates abscess/edema.
*   **Loss of Lordosis:** Straightening of the cervical spine ("Bamboo spine") due to muscle spasm,.
*   **Air-fluid level** or presence of gas (from gas-forming organisms),,.
*   **Anterior displacement:** Of the larynx and trachea.

#### **2. CT Scan (Computed Tomography)**
*   **Gold Standard:** Differentiates between retropharyngeal abscess and cellulitis/adenitis.
*   Shows the extent of the abscess and differentiates it from a [[prevertebral abscess]].
*   Typically shows a hypodense mass with ring enhancement.

### **Differential Diagnosis**
*   [[Acute Epiglottitis]].
*   [[Croup]] (Laryngotracheobronchitis).
*   [[Peritonsillar abscess]].
*   [[Prevertebral abscess]].
*   [[Parapharyngeal abscess]].

**Comparison: Retropharyngeal vs. Prevertebral Abscess**

| Feature | Retropharyngeal Abscess | Prevertebral Abscess |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Location** | Anterior to prevertebral fascia | Posterior to prevertebral fascia |
| **Etiology** | Lymphadenitis, Trauma | TB Spine (Pott's), Vertebral trauma |
| **Bulge** | **Unilateral/Paramedian** (due to midline raphe) | **Midline/Central** |
| **Symptoms** | Dysphagia, Stridor | Torticollis, stiffness, less dysphagia |
| **X-ray** | Widened prevertebral space | Vertebral destruction/erosion |

### **Treatment**

#### **1. Medical Management**
*   **Airway Security:** Priority. Intubation or [[tracheostomy]] may be required if the airway is compromised,,.
*   **IV Antibiotics:** Broad-spectrum antibiotics covering aerobes and anaerobes (e.g., Ceftriaxone, Clindamycin),,.
*   **IV Fluids:** To correct dehydration.

#### **2. Surgical Management**

**A. Acute Abscess**
*   **Incision and Drainage (Transoral Approach):**
    *   Done without anesthesia (or careful intubation) to prevent rupture during induction.
    *   **Position:** Supine with head low (**Rose position**) to prevent aspiration of pus into the larynx,.
    *   **Incision:** Vertical incision over the most fluctuant part,.
    *   Suction must be ready immediately.

**B. Chronic (Tubercular) Abscess**
*   **Medical:** Full course of Anti-Tubercular Therapy (ATT),.
*   **Drainage (Transcervical/External Approach):**
    *   Incision along the anterior or posterior border of the [[sternocleidomastoid]] muscle,.
    *   **Note:** Intraoral drainage is **contraindicated** in chronic/cold abscesses to avoid secondary infection and chronic sinus formation.

### **Complications**
*   **Airway Obstruction:** Laryngeal edema or mechanical obstruction leading to asphyxia,.
*   **Rupture:** Leads to aspiration pneumonia or lung abscess,.
*   **Mediastinitis:** Spread of infection inferiorly to the posterior mediastinum,.
*   **Vascular:** Thrombosis of [[internal jugular vein]] or erosion of the carotid artery,.
*   **[[Grisel’s syndrome]]:** Atlanto-axial subluxation due to hyperemia and ligament laxity.
