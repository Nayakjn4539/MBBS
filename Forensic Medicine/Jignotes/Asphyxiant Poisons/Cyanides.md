# [[Asphyxiant Poisons]] > Cyanides

### **Cyanides**

Cyanide is predominantly an **asphyxiant poison** (histotoxic anoxia) widely available in various forms used in industries and photography. It is considered one of the most rapidly acting poisons known to mankind.

#### **Forms and Sources**
1.  **Hydrocyanic Acid (HCN):** Also known as [[Prussic acid]]. It is a colorless, volatile liquid with a distinct odor of **bitter almonds**.
    *   **Scheele’s Acid:** 4% solution of HCN.
2.  **Salts:** [[Potassium Cyanide]] (KCN) and [[Sodium Cyanide]] (NaCN). White crystalline powders used in electroplating, gold extraction, and photography.
3.  **Gas:** Hydrogen cyanide (e.g., **Zyklon B**, used in gas chambers).
4.  **Vegetable Sources (Cyanogens):** Contain cyanogenic glycosides (Amygdalin).
    *   Bitter almonds.
    *   Cassava (Tapioca).
    *   Cherry stones, plum seeds, apricot pits, bamboo shoots.
    *   *Linum usitatissimum* (Linseed).
5.  **Fire Smoke:** Burning of polyurethane foams and plastics releases cyanide fumes.

#### **Mode of Action**
Cyanide causes **Histotoxic Anoxia** (Cytotoxic Anoxia).
*   **Mechanism:** The cyanide ion ($CN^-$) has a high affinity for ferric iron ($Fe^{3+}$). It binds to the ferric iron in the [[Cytochrome Oxidase]] enzyme system (specifically Cytochrome $a_3$) in the mitochondria.
*   **Result:** This blocks the electron transport chain and inhibits oxidative phosphorylation.
*   **Effect:** Tissues cannot utilize oxygen even though the blood is fully oxygenated. The venous blood retains a bright red oxygenated color (arterialization of venous blood).

#### **Fatal Dose and Fatal Period**
| Form | Fatal Dose | Fatal Period |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hydrocyanic Acid (HCN)** | 50–60 mg (pure acid) | 2–10 minutes (can be immediate) |
| **Cyanide Salts (KCN/NaCN)** | 200–300 mg | 20–30 minutes (delayed due to gastric reaction) |
| **Inhalation (Gas)** | 270 ppm | Immediate |

### **Clinical Features**

**1. Inhalation (Gas/High Dose):**
*   Symptoms are almost instantaneous.
*   The victim may let out a cry due to anxiety or laryngospasm ("Cry of the animal") and collapse immediately.
*   Convulsions followed by paralysis and respiratory failure.

**2. Ingestion (Salts/Liquid):**
*   **Taste:** Bitter, burning, acrid taste.
*   **GI:** Nausea, vomiting, constriction of throat.
*   **Respiratory:** Dyspnea (air hunger), smell of **bitter almonds** in breath.
*   **CNS:** Headache, vertigo, confusion, giddiness, loss of consciousness.
*   **Eyes:** Pupils dilated, prominent, glassy, and unreactive.
*   **Skin:** Often pink or **cherry-red** (due to oxyhemoglobin retention), but can be cyanosed in later stages due to respiratory failure.

> **Note on Smell:** The ability to smell bitter almonds is an **X-linked trait**. Approx. 20–40% of the population (anosmics) cannot detect this smell.

**3. Chronic Poisoning:**
*   Seen in populations consuming unprocessed cassava (Tapioca).
*   Causes **Tropical Ataxic Neuropathy** (demyelination of spinal cord), optic atrophy, and nerve deafness.

### **Diagnosis**
*   **History:** Occupation (photographer, jeweler), sudden collapse.
*   **Smell:** Bitter almonds.
*   **Lee-Jones Test:** Gastric aspirate + Ferrous sulfate + NaOH $\rightarrow$ Boil & Cool $\rightarrow$ Add HCl. A **Prussian Blue** color indicates positive for cyanide.

### **Treatment**
This is a supreme medical emergency. **Speed** is the essence of treatment.

**1. General Measures:**
*   Remove patient from source.
*   Administer **100% Oxygen** (essential to compete for cytochrome oxidase sites).
*   Artificial respiration (Ambu bag preferred over mouth-to-mouth to protect the rescuer).
*   Gastric lavage with 5% [[Sodium thiosulfate]] or 0.1% [[Potassium permanganate]].

**2. Specific Antidotes (The Cyanide Kit):**
The classic treatment relies on creating **Methemoglobin** (which binds cyanide) and then converting it to harmless Thiocyanate.

*   **Step 1: Amyl Nitrite (Inhalation):** While IV access is being established. Crush perles into a handkerchief.
*   **Step 2: Sodium Nitrite (IV):** 300 mg (10 ml of 3% solution) over 3 minutes.
    *   *Mechanism:* Nitrites convert Hemoglobin ($Fe^{2+}$) to **Methemoglobin** ($Fe^{3+}$). Cyanide loves ferric iron, so it leaves the cytochrome oxidase to bind with Methemoglobin, forming **Cyanmethemoglobin**.
*   **Step 3: Sodium Thiosulfate (IV):** 12.5 g (50 ml of 25% solution).
    *   *Mechanism:* The enzyme **Rhodanese** (in liver) transfers sulfur from thiosulfate to the cyanide, converting Cyanmethemoglobin into **Sodium Thiocyanate**, which is non-toxic and excreted in urine.

**3. Alternative Antidotes:**
*   **Hydroxocobalamin (Vitamin B12a):** Combines with cyanide to form **Cyanocobalamin** (Vitamin B12). It is non-toxic and preferred in fire victims where CO poisoning might coexist (nitrites can worsen hypoxia in CO poisoning). Dose: 5g IV.
*   **Dicobalt Edetate (Kelocyanor):** A chelating agent. Very effective but toxic (causes cobalt poisoning if cyanide is absent). Dose: 300–600 mg IV.
*   **4-DMAP (4-Dimethylaminophenol):** Rapid methemoglobin former used in Europe.

**Mnemonic for Treatment:** **"Nitrites make the Bait, Thio seals the Fate"**
(Nitrites create methemoglobin "bait" to pull cyanide off cells; Thiosulfate converts it to thiocyanate to seal its fate/excretion).

### **Postmortem Appearances (Autopsy Findings)**

**External Findings:**
*   **Smell:** Characteristic **Bitter Almond** odor from the mouth and nose (medicolegal experts must not inhale deeply).
*   **Postmortem Staining:** **Bright Red** or **Cherry Red** color (due to Cyanmethemoglobin and Oxyhemoglobin).
*   **Face:** Congested, eyes prominent, pupils dilated.
*   **Froth:** Fine froth at mouth/nose (due to pulmonary edema).
*   **Rigor Mortis:** Appears and passes off early.

**Internal Findings:**
*   **Brain:** **Open the head first** to detect the odor of bitter almonds in the brain tissue before the strong smell of stomach contents masks it.
*   **Stomach:**
    *   Mucosa is congested, brick-red, or velvety.
    *   If salts (KCN/NaCN) were ingested, the mucosa may be blackened and eroded due to the formation of **Alkaline Hematin** (caustic effect of the strong alkali salt).
    *   Contents usually smell of bitter almonds.
*   **Lungs:** Congested and edematous.
*   **Blood:** Fluid and bright red.

### **Medicolegal Aspects**
1.  **Suicide:** Most common. 'Ideal' suicide poison for chemists, jewelers, and medical professionals due to rapid action and small fatal dose. Used by spies (L-pill) and Nazi leaders (Himmler, Goering).
2.  **Homicide:** Rare due to strong smell and taste, but historically significant (e.g., Jonestown Massacre, Rasputin case). Can be administered in alcohol or strong-tasting food to mask the flavor.
3.  **Accidental:**
    *   Inhalation in industries (electroplating).
    *   Chemists handling hydrocyanic acid.
    *   Eating apricot kernels or cassava.
4.  **Judicial Execution:** Used in gas chambers in some US states. HCN gas is generated by dropping NaCN pellets into sulfuric acid.
5.  **Cattle Poisoning:** Consumption of immature Jowar/Sorghum or Linseed plant (contain cyanogenic glycosides).
