# [[Autopsy]] > Autopsy of foetus or infant

### Objectives of Foetal/Infant Autopsy
The primary medicolegal objectives when examining the body of a foetus or infant are to determine:
1.  **Viability:** Was the foetus capable of independent existence?
2.  **Nature of Birth:** Was it [[Live birth]] (born alive) or [[Dead born]] (intrauterine death) or [[Stillborn]] (died during birth)?
3.  **Cause of Death:** Natural (e.g., congenital anomalies), Accidental (e.g., cord around neck), or Homicidal (Infanticide).
4.  **Identity:** If the body is unknown or abandoned.
5.  **Time since death** and **Time since birth**.

### I. External Examination

**1. General Identification and Measurements**
*   **Weight:** Weigh the body (Normal term: 2.5–3 kg).
*   **Length:** Measure Crown-Heel length (CHL) and Crown-Rump length (CRL).
*   **Head Circumference:** Occipito-frontal circumference.
*   **General condition:** Note the state of nutrition, cleanliness, and presence of any wrapping materials (preserve these for trace evidence).

**2. Signs of Maturity (to assess Viability)**
Viability usually accepted at **210 days (7 months)** of gestation.
*   **Skin:** Covered with **Vernix caseosa** (cheesy white substance) in term infants. Color is usually pink.
*   **Hair:** Dark scalp hair (2–3 cm long). Presence of **Lanugo** (fine downy hair) mostly on shoulders/back (disappears by term).
*   **Nails:** Reach beyond fingertips in term infants; reach ends of toes.
*   **Ears:** Cartilage is distinct and firm; ears recoil when folded.
*   **Genitals:**
    *   **Male:** Testicles descended into the scrotum.
    *   **Female:** Labia majora covers labia minora.
*   **Plantar Creases:** Distinct creases present over the anterior 2/3rd or whole sole.
*   **Umbilicus:** Located at the center of the body (midpoint between xiphisternum and pubis).

**3. Examination of Umbilical Cord**
*   **Condition:** Determine if it is cut (sharp/jagged), torn, or tied (type of ligature).
*   **Measurements:** Length (risk of strangulation if long, traction rupture if short).
*   **Vital Reaction:** Look for a ring of redness (inflammatory zone) at the base (indicates survival for ~36 hours).
*   **Mummification:** Drying begins at the tip; falls off by 5–7 days.

**4. Signs of Maceration (Intrauterine Death)**
If the foetus died in utero and remained there for 3–4 days (sterile autolysis), it shows [[Maceration]]:
*   **Skin Slippage:** Epidermis peels off easily exposing raw red dermis.
*   **Overlapping of Skull Bones:** Due to liquefaction of brain (**Spalding’s Sign** on X-ray).
*   **Discoloration:** Body appears brownish-red; soft and flaccid.
*   **Odor:** Distinctive sour/rancid smell (not putrid unless infected).

**5. Injuries**
*   Differentiate birth trauma (e.g., [[Caput succedaneum]], [[Cephalhematoma]]) from inflicted violence.
*   Look for nail marks around the mouth/nose (suggesting **Smothering**).
*   Check neck for ligature marks (suggesting **Strangulation** or cord loop).

### II. Internal Examination

**1. Incision Techniques**
*   **Inverted Y-incision:** Preferred for newborns. Incision starts from the chin, goes down to the umbilicus, and bifurcates to the ankles (prevents damage to the umbilical vessels).
*   **Modified Y-incision:** From mastoid processes to suprasternal notch to pubis.

**2. Thoracic and Abdominal Examination**
*   **Sequence:** **Open the abdomen *before* the thorax.**
*   **Position of Diaphragm:**
    *   **Unrespired (Dead born):** Level of 4th or 5th rib.
    *   **Respired (Live born):** Level of 6th or 7th rib (lungs expand and push diaphragm down).
*   **Umbilical Vessels:** Inspect umbilical arteries and vein for clots/thrombus (indicates survival).

**3. Tests for Live Birth (Respiration)**

**A. Hydrostatic Test (Raygat’s Test)**
*   **Principle:** Respired lungs contain air and float in water; unrespired lungs are solid and sink.
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Remove lungs along with heart, thymus, and trachea (Pluck technique).
    2.  Place the entire mass in a bucket of water. (Floats = Positive).
    3.  Separate lungs and place them in water.
    4.  Cut lungs into small lobes/pieces and place in water.
    5.  **Crucial Step:** Squeeze the pieces under water to remove decomposition gases and release. If they still float, it indicates residual air in alveoli (Positive for live birth).
*   **False Positives:** [[Putrefaction]] (gas bubbles), artificial respiration.
*   **False Negatives:** Atelectasis, pneumonia, pulmonary edema.

**B. Static Test (Fodere’s Test)**
*   Absolute weight of lungs increases after respiration due to blood influx.
*   **Unrespired:** ~30 gm.
*   **Respired:** ~60-70 gm.

**C. Ploucquet’s Test**
*   Ratio of lung weight to body weight.
*   Unrespired (1:70); Respired (1:35). (Not reliable).

**D. Stomach-Bowel Test (Breslau’s Second Life Test)**
*   Based on swallowed air entering the GIT.
*   Ligature the stomach and intestines at ends, remove, and place in water.
*   Floating indicates air presence (swallowed air signifies life).

**E. Wreden’s Test**
*   Presence of air in the middle ear (replaces gelatinous tissue after birth).

**4. Examination of Skull and Brain**
*   **Technique:** **Beneke’s Technique** (Open book/Butterfly method) is used.
*   Cut the skull along the sutures and fontanelles using scissors (not saw) to preserve the dura and underlying structures.
*   Inspect for **Falx cerebri** and **Tentorium cerebelli** tears (common in molding/birth trauma).
*   Check for intracranial hemorrhage (Subdural is most common due to birth trauma).

**5. Centers of Ossification**
Used to estimate the age of the foetus. Slice the bone/cartilage to look for a red vascular gritty spot.
*   **Calcaneum:** Appears at 5th month.
*   **Talus:** Appears at 7th month.
*   **Lower end of Femur:** Appears at 9th month (Term).
*   **Cuboid:** Appears at birth/9th month.
*   **Upper end of Tibia:** Appears at birth/full term.

### III. Causes of Infant Death (Medicolegal Aspects)

**1. Acts of Omission (Neglect)**
*   Failure to tie the umbilical cord (Hemorrhage).
*   Failure to clear airways (Suffocation).
*   Failure to protect from cold (Hypothermia).
*   Failure to feed ([[Starvation]]).

**2. Acts of Commission (Infanticide)**
*   **Suffocation:** Smothering (hand/pillow over face), Gagging.
*   **Strangulation:** Using ligature or hand (Throttling).
*   **Head Injury:** Striking head against wall/floor.
*   **Drowning:** In bucket or tank.
*   **Poisoning:** Opium, smeared on nipples.

**3. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS/Cot Death)**
*   Sudden death of an infant <1 year which remains unexplained after complete autopsy and scene investigation.
*   **Autopsy findings:** Usually negative/nonspecific. May show petechiae on thymus/pleura/epicardium. Diagnosis of exclusion.

**4. Battered Baby Syndrome (Caffey's Syndrome)**
*   Repetitive non-accidental injuries by parent/guardian.
*   **Triad:** Subdural hematoma + Multiple fractures (various stages of healing) + Retinal hemorrhage.

### IV. Sample Preservation
*   **Blood:** From umbilical vessels or heart (for DNA, grouping).
*   **Tissues:** Lung (histology for expansion/hyaline membrane), Liver, Kidney.
*   **Stomach contents:** For toxicology or presence of milk.
*   **Placenta:** If available, check for infarcts or abnormalities.
