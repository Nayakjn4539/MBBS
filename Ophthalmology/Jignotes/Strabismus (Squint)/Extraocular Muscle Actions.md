# Extraocular Muscle Actions

The movement of the [[Eyeball]] is controlled by six [[Extraocular Muscles]] (EOMs): four recti and two obliques. Understanding their actions requires knowledge of their anatomical insertion relative to the center of rotation and the optical axis.

### Nerve Supply
A fundamental concept for all ocular motility.
*   **Lateral Rectus (LR):** Supplied by [[Abducens Nerve]] (CN VI).
*   **Superior Oblique (SO):** Supplied by [[Trochlear Nerve]] (CN IV).
*   **All others (MR, SR, IR, IO):** Supplied by [[Oculomotor Nerve]] (CN III).

**Mnemonic:** **LR6(SO4)3**

### Mechanics of Eye Movements

The eye rotates around a center of rotation (roughly 13.5 mm behind the cornea) across three axes (Axes of Fick):
1.  **Vertical Axis (Z-axis):** Horizontal movements (Adduction/Abduction).
2.  **Transverse/Horizontal Axis (X-axis):** Vertical movements (Elevation/Depression).
3.  **Anteroposterior/Sagittal Axis (Y-axis):** Torsional movements (Intorsion/Extorsion).

#### Terminology of Movements
*   **Ductions:** Uniocular movements (e.g., Adduction, Abduction).
*   **Versions:** Binocular conjugate movements (eyes move in same direction, e.g., Dextroversion).
*   **Vergences:** Binocular disjugate movements (eyes move in opposite directions, e.g., [[Convergence]]).

### Actions of Individual Muscles

The action of a muscle depends on the position of the eye.
*   **Primary Action:** The major effect when the eye is in the primary position.
*   **Secondary & Tertiary Actions:** Additional effects due to the angle of muscle insertion.

#### 1. Horizontal Recti
These muscles have only one action because their plane of action coincides with the horizontal plane of the eye.

| Muscle | Primary Action | Secondary Action | Tertiary Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Medial Rectus]] (MR)** | **Adduction** | None | None |
| **[[Lateral Rectus]] (LR)** | **Abduction** | None | None |

#### 2. Vertical Recti
These muscles run outward and forward, making an angle of **23°** with the visual axis.
*   **Superior Rectus (SR):** Attached to the superior sclera.
*   **Inferior Rectus (IR):** Attached to the inferior sclera.

| Muscle | Primary Action (Vertical) | Secondary Action (Torsional) | Tertiary Action (Horizontal) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Superior Rectus]] (SR)** | **Elevation** | **Intorsion** (Incycloduction) | **Adduction** |
| **[[Inferior Rectus]] (IR)** | **Depression** | **Extorsion** (Excycloduction) | **Adduction** |

#### 3. Oblique Muscles
These muscles run backward and outward, making an angle of **51°** with the visual axis. They insert *behind* the equator.
*   **Superior Oblique (SO):** Functional origin at the [[Trochlea]]. Inserts supero-temporally.
*   **Inferior Oblique (IO):** Originates from orbital floor. Inserts infero-temporally.

| Muscle | Primary Action (Torsional) | Secondary Action (Vertical) | Tertiary Action (Horizontal) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Superior Oblique]] (SO)** | **Intorsion** (Incycloduction) | **Depression** | **Abduction** |
| **[[Inferior Oblique]] (IO)** | **Extorsion** (Excycloduction) | **Elevation** | **Abduction** |

> **Clinical Implication:**
> *   **Recti are Adductors:** SR and IR both adduct.
> *   **Obliques are Abductors:** SO and IO both abduct.
> *   **Superiors are Intorters:** SR and SO both intort (rotate 12 o'clock meridian nasally).
> *   **Inferiors are Extorters:** IR and IO both extort (rotate 12 o'clock meridian temporally).

**Mnemonics:** 
*   **SIN-RAD**: **S**uperiors are **IN**torters; **R**ecti are **AD**ductors.
*   **IOU**: **I**nferior **O**blique goes **U**p (Elevation).

### Physiological Basis of Muscle Actions

The effectiveness of a muscle's action changes based on the horizontal position of the eye (Adduction vs. Abduction).

#### Vertical Recti (Axis = 23°)
*   **In Abduction (23°):** The visual axis coincides with the muscle axis. The SR and IR become **pure elevators and depressors**.
*   **In Adduction:** The angle increases to 67°. The vertical action decreases, and **torsional/horizontal actions increase**.

#### Oblique Muscles (Axis = 51°)
*   **In Adduction (51°):** The visual axis coincides with the muscle axis. The SO and IO become **pure depressors and elevators**.
*   **In Abduction:** The angle reduces. The vertical action decreases, and **torsional actions predominate**.

**Summary Table of Diagnostic Gaze Positions:**

| Muscle | Best Position to Test Vertical Action | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Superior Rectus** | Eye **Abducted** | Visual axis aligns with muscle plane. |
| **Inferior Rectus** | Eye **Abducted** | Visual axis aligns with muscle plane. |
| **Superior Oblique** | Eye **Adducted** | Visual axis aligns with muscle plane. |
| **Inferior Oblique** | Eye **Adducted** | Visual axis aligns with muscle plane. |

### Muscle Relationships

Understanding how muscles work together is crucial for diagnosing [[Strabismus]].

#### 1. Agonists and Antagonists (Same Eye)
*   **Agonist:** The muscle moving the eye in a specific direction.
*   **Antagonist:** The muscle opposing the movement.
    *   *Example:* In Right eye abduction, Right LR is agonist, Right MR is antagonist.

#### 2. Synergists (Same Eye)
Muscles that assist each other in a specific movement.
*   **Elevators:** SR and IO.
*   **Depressors:** IR and SO.
*   **Intorters:** SO and SR.
*   **Extorters:** IO and IR.

#### 3. Yoke Muscles (Contralateral Synergists)
A pair of muscles (one from each eye) that contract simultaneously to produce a conjugate movement (Version).

| Direction of Gaze | Right Eye Muscle | Left Eye Muscle |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dextroversion (Right)** | Lateral Rectus | Medial Rectus |
| **Levoversion (Left)** | Medial Rectus | Lateral Rectus |
| **Dextro-elevation (Up & Right)** | Superior Rectus | Inferior Oblique |
| **Dextro-depression (Down & Right)**| Inferior Rectus | Superior Oblique |
| **Levo-elevation (Up & Left)** | Inferior Oblique | Superior Rectus |
| **Levo-depression (Down & Left)** | Superior Oblique | Inferior Rectus |

### Laws of Ocular Motility

#### 1. Sherrington’s Law of Reciprocal Innervation
*   **Definition:** When an agonist muscle receives an excitatory signal to contract, its direct antagonist receives an equivalent inhibitory signal to relax.
*   **Application:** Applies to uniocular movements.
*   **Example:** In right eye abduction, the Right LR contracts (innervation increases) and the Right MR relaxes (innervation decreases).

#### 2. Hering’s Law of Equal Innervation
*   **Definition:** Equal and simultaneous innervation flows to the **yoke muscles** of both eyes during conjugate movements.
*   **Application:** Applies to binocular movements.
*   **Example:** When looking to the right, the Right LR and Left MR receive equal innervation.
*   **Clinical Relevance:** In [[Paralytic Squint]], the secondary deviation (normal eye) is greater than the primary deviation (affected eye) because excessive innervation is sent to the paretic muscle to attempt movement, causing the normal yoke muscle to overact massively.
