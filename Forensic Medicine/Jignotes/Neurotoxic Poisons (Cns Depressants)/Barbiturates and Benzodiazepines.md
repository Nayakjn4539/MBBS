# [[Neurotoxic Poisons (Cns Depressants)]] > Barbiturates and Benzodiazepines

# Barbiturates and Benzodiazepines

These two groups of drugs act as **[[CNS depressants]]** (sedative-hypnotics). While barbiturates were historically the primary agents for sedation and suicide, they have largely been replaced by benzodiazepines due to the latter's wider safety margin.

## I. Barbiturates

Barbiturates are derivatives of **barbituric acid**. They are often referred to as "Sleeping pills," "Goof balls," or "Downers."

### Classification
They are classified based on the duration of action:

| Type | Duration | Examples | Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Long Acting** | 8–24 Hours | [[Phenobarbitone]], Mephobarbitone | Anticonvulsant |
| **Intermediate Acting** | 3–6 Hours | Butobarbitone, Amobarbitone | Insomnia (Historical) |
| **Short Acting** | < 3 Hours | Pentobarbitone, Secobarbitone | Insomnia (Historical) |
| **Ultra-short Acting** | 15–30 Mins | [[Thiopentone]], Methohexitone | Anesthesia induction |

### Mechanism of Action
*   They act on the **GABA-A receptor** chloride channel complex.
*   They **potentiate GABAergic inhibition** by increasing the *duration* of chloride channel opening.
*   At high doses, they can directly mimic GABA and depress the reticular activating system (RAS) and medullary respiratory center.

### Clinical Features of Acute Poisoning
The signs resemble alcoholic intoxication but without the smell of alcohol.
*   **CNS:** Drowsiness, lethargy, slurred speech, ataxia, confusion, and headache.
*   **Eyes:** Pupils are initially constricted (miosis) but may dilate later due to hypoxia. Nystagmus is common.
*   **Respiratory:** Shallow and slow breathing (respiratory depression is the usual cause of death).
*   **Cardiovascular:** Hypotension and weak pulse leading to shock.
*   **Skin:** **[[Barbiturate Blisters]]** (Cutaneous bullae). These are characteristic clear vesicles on an erythematous base, found on pressure points (between fingers, inner knees, ankles, buttocks).
*   **Coma:** Deep coma with loss of reflexes.

> **Mnemonic: BARBITS**
> *   **B**radycardia / **B**listers
> *   **A**taxia
> *   **R**espiratory depression
> *   **B**lood pressure drop (Hypotension)
> *   **I**ntoxication appearance (Slurred speech)
> *   **T**emperature drop (Hypothermia)
> *   **S**kin bullae

### Barbiturate Automatism
This is a specific phenomenon seen in accidental poisoning.
*   A person takes a therapeutic dose to sleep but fails to fall asleep immediately.
*   Due to drug-induced confusion and amnesia (forgetfulness), they forget they have already taken the drug.
*   They repeat the dose multiple times, leading to severe overdose and death.

### Fatal Dose and Period
*   **Fatal Dose:** 
    *   Short-acting: 1–2 g
    *   Medium-acting: 2–3 g
    *   Long-acting: 3–5 g.
*   **Fatal Period:** usually 24 to 48 hours.

### Management
There is **NO specific antidote** for barbiturates. Treatment is supportive:
1.  **Airway & Breathing:** Intubation and mechanical ventilation (crucial).
2.  **[[Gastric Lavage]]:** Useful if patient presents early (within 4 hours). Activated charcoal is highly effective.
3.  **Scandinavian Method:** A protocol of supportive care relying on aggressive physiological maintenance (anti-shock measures, oxygen) *without* the use of stimulants (analeptics).
4.  **[[Forced Alkaline Diuresis]]:** Effective only for **Phenobarbitone** (long-acting) because it is a weak acid. Alkalinizing urine (pH 7.5–8.0) using Sodium Bicarbonate traps the drug in urine and enhances excretion.
5.  **Haemodialysis/Haemoperfusion:** Used in severe cases or renal failure.

### Postmortem Findings
*   **External:** Cyanosis, froth at mouth/nose. **Barbiturate blisters** (pathognomonic if present).
*   **Internal:** 
    *   Congestion of all organs (lungs, liver, kidney).
    *   Stomach mucosa may show erosion or undissolved capsules/tablets.
    *   **[[Subendocardial hemorrhages]]** may be seen.

### Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Suicide:** Most common manner of death involving barbiturates (cheap, painless).
*   **Accidental:** Automatism.
*   **Homicide:** Rare due to large dose required and bitter taste.
*   **Truth Serum:** **[[Sodium Pentothal]]** (Thiopentone) is used in **[[Narcoanalysis]]**. It lowers inhibition, making the subject talkative, but does not guarantee the truth.

## II. Benzodiazepines (BZDs)

These are chemically unrelated to barbiturates but have similar sedative, anxiolytic, and muscle-relaxant properties. They are much safer than barbiturates.

### Examples
*   **Short acting:** [[Midazolam]], Triazolam.
*   **Intermediate:** [[Alprazolam]], Lorazepam.
*   **Long acting:** [[Diazepam]] (Valium), Chlordiazepoxide, Flurazepam.

### Mechanism of Action
*   They bind to specific BZD receptors on the GABA complex.
*   They increase the **frequency** of chloride channel opening (unlike barbiturates which increase duration).

### Clinical Features
Toxicity is generally low unless combined with other CNS depressants (like alcohol).
*   **CNS:** Drowsiness, dizziness, ataxia (staggering gait), dysarthria (slurred speech), confusion.
*   **Ocular:** Nystagmus is common.
*   **Severe poisoning:** Respiratory depression and coma (rare in isolation, common in mixed overdose).
*   **Paradoxical reaction:** Excitement, aggression, or delirium (especially in elderly/children).

### Diagnosis
*   Screening tests (TLC, Immunoassays).
*   Quantitative levels are not usually clinically useful as tolerance varies.

### Treatment
1.  **Supportive Care:** ABC (Airway, Breathing, Circulation).
2.  **Decontamination:** Gastric lavage (if early), Activated charcoal.
3.  **Specific Antidote:** **[[Flumazenil]]**
    *   It is a competitive antagonist at the BZD receptor.
    *   **Dose:** 0.2 mg IV, repeated incrementally up to 3 mg.
    *   **Contraindication:** Do not use in patients with mixed tricyclic antidepressant overdose or chronic BZD dependence (may precipitate seizures).

### Medicolegal Aspects
1.  **Suicide:** Frequently used, but rarely fatal on their own. Fatalities occur when mixed with **[[Alcohol]]**.
2.  **Date Rape Drugs:** **[[Flunitrazepam]]** (Rohypnol) is tasteless and odorless. It causes sedation and **anterograde amnesia**, making the victim unable to recall sexual assault.
3.  **Facilitating Crime:** Administered in food/drink to travelers to induce sleep for robbery (Traveler's diarrhea/poisoning).
