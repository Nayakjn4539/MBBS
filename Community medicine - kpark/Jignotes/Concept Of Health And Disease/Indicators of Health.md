# [[Concept Of Health And Disease]] > Indicators of Health

### **Indicators of Health**

Health indicators are variables which help to measure changes in the health status of a community. They are essential for community diagnosis, comparing health status between countries, and evaluating health services,.

Since [[Health]] is multidimensional, there is no single indicator that captures all aspects. A profile of various indicators is required.

### **1. Characteristics of an Ideal Indicator**
For an indicator to be scientifically respectable and useful, it must satisfy the following criteria:

*   **Valid:** It should measure what it is supposed to measure,.
*   **Reliable:** It should give the same results if measured by different people in similar circumstances.
*   **Sensitive:** It should be sensitive to changes in the situation concerned.
*   **Specific:** It should reflect changes only in the situation concerned.
*   **Feasible:** Data collection should be easy and not too expensive.
*   **Relevant:** It should contribute to the understanding of the phenomenon of interest.

> **Mnemonic: VR SS FeaR** (Valid, Reliable, Sensitive, Specific, Feasible, Relevant)

### **2. Classification of Health Indicators**

#### **A. Mortality Indicators**
These are the traditional measures of health status.
1.  **[[Crude Death Rate]] (CDR):** Number of deaths per 1000 population per year. It is a fair indicator but influenced by the age-sex composition of the population.
2.  **[[Expectation of Life]] (Life Expectancy):**
    *   Average number of years a person is expected to live if current mortality trends continue.
    *   It is a **positive mortality indicator**.
    *   Good indicator of socio-economic development.
3.  **[[Infant Mortality Rate]] (IMR):**
    *   Ratio of deaths under 1 year of age in a given year to total live births.
    *   **Most sensitive indicator** of health status, level of living, and effectiveness of [[Maternal and Child Health]] (MCH) services.
    *   It is one of the best predictors of state failure.
4.  **Child Mortality Rate (1-4 years):** Excludes infant mortality; reflects adverse environmental exposure and malnutrition.
5.  **Under-5 Proportionate Mortality Rate:** Proportion of total deaths occurring in the under-5 age group.
6.  **[[Maternal Mortality Ratio]] (MMR):** Measures the risk of women dying from puerperal causes.
7.  **Disease-Specific Mortality:** Mortality rates for specific diseases (e.g., Cancer, CVD).
8.  **Proportional Mortality Rate:** Proportion of all deaths attributed to a specific disease (e.g., Coronary heart disease causes 25-30% of deaths).
9.  **[[Case Fatality Rate]] (CFR):** Measures the killing power (virulence) of a disease.
    *   Formula: (Total deaths due to disease / Total cases of disease) × 100.

#### **B. Morbidity Indicators**
Mortality data does not reveal the burden of ill-health. Morbidity indicators describe the frequency, duration, and severity of disease.
*   [[Incidence]] and [[Prevalence]]
*   Notification rates
*   Attendance rates at OPD/Health centers
*   Admission, readmission, and discharge rates
*   Duration of stay in hospital
*   Spells of sickness or absence from work/school.

#### **C. Disability Indicators**
Based on the premise that health implies a full range of daily activities.
1.  **[[Sullivan's Index]] (Disability-Free Life Expectancy):** Life expectancy minus the probable duration of bed disability/inability to perform major activities,.
2.  **[[HALE]] (Health-Adjusted Life Expectancy):** Equivalent number of years in full health a newborn can expect to live based on current rates of ill-health and mortality.
3.  **[[DALY]] (Disability Adjusted Life Years):**
    *   **Best measure** of the burden of disease.
    *   Formula: **DALY = YLL (Years of Lost Life) + YLD (Years Lost to Disability)**.
    *   One DALY = One lost year of healthy life.
4.  **[[QALY]] (Quality Adjusted Life Years):** Measures both quality and quantity of life lived. Used in cost-utility analysis.

#### **D. Nutritional Status Indicators**
Important for monitoring the health of vulnerable groups.
*   Anthropometric measurements of preschool children (e.g., weight, height, mid-arm circumference).
*   Heights of children at school entry.
*   Prevalence of [[Low Birth Weight]] (weight < 2.5 kg).

#### **E. Health Care Delivery Indicators**
Reflects the equity of distribution of health resources,.
*   Doctor-population ratio.
*   Doctor-nurse ratio.
*   Population-bed ratio.
*   Population per health center/sub-center.

#### **F. Utilization Rates**
Measures the extent to which people use health services.
*   Proportion of infants fully immunized.
*   Percentage of population using family planning methods.
*   Bed occupancy rate.
*   Average length of stay in hospital.

#### **G. Indicators of Social and Mental Health**
Indirect measures of social and mental pathology.
*   Suicide and homicide rates.
*   Road traffic accidents.
*   Alcohol and drug abuse rates.
*   Juvenile delinquency.
*   Battered-baby and battered-wife syndromes.

#### **H. Environmental Indicators**
Reflect the quality of the physical/biological environment.
*   Pollution indices (air, water, noise).
*   Proportion of population with access to safe water and sanitation.

#### **I. Socio-economic Indicators**
These influence health status interpretation,.
*   Rate of population increase.
*   Per capita GNP.
*   Dependency ratio.
*   Literacy rates (especially female literacy).
*   Family size.

> **Mnemonic for Socio-economic Indicators:** **He FLAGGED**
> *   **H**ousing
> *   **e**ducation (Literacy)
> *   **F**amily size
> *   **L**iteracy rate
> *   **A**vailability per capita calorie
> *   **G**NP per capita
> *   **G**rowth rate
> *   **E**mployment levels
> *   **D**ependency ratio

#### **J. Health Policy Indicators**
Reflects political commitment.
*   Proportion of GNP spent on health services.
*   Proportion of GNP spent on health-related activities.

#### **K. Indicators of Quality of Life**
1.  **[[Physical Quality of Life Index]] (PQLI):**
    *   Consolidates three indicators: **Infant Mortality, Life Expectancy at age one, and Literacy**.
    *   Scale: 0 to 100 (0 = worst, 100 = best).
    *   Does *not* measure economic growth.
2.  **[[Human Development Index]] (HDI):**
    *   Composite index of three dimensions:
        *   **Longevity** (Life expectancy at birth).
        *   **Knowledge** (Mean years of schooling + Expected years of schooling).
        *   **Standard of Living** (Real GNI per capita).
    *   Scale: 0 to 1.

### **Clinical Relevance**
*   **Epidemiological Diagnosis:** Indicators help in performing a "Community Diagnosis," identifying priority health problems (e.g., high IMR suggests poor MCH services and environmental sanitation).
*   **Resource Allocation:** High DALYs in specific diseases (like mental illness or TB) guide governments to allocate more funds to those programs.
*   **Monitoring Progress:** Utilization rates (e.g., immunization coverage) tell a Medical Officer if their PHC is functioning effectively.
