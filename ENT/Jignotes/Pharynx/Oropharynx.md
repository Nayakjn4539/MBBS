# [[Pharynx]] > Oropharynx

### **Anatomy and Physiology of the Oropharynx**

The [[oropharynx]] is the middle subdivision of the [[pharynx]], acting as a critical conduit for both the respiratory and digestive tracts. It serves as a continuation of the [[nasopharynx]] superiorly and leads into the [[laryngopharynx]] (hypopharynx) inferiorly.

### **1. Extent and Vertebral Levels**
*   **Location:** Situated behind the [[oral cavity]].
*   **Vertical Extent:** Extends from the lower border of the [[soft palate]] (plane of the hard palate) superiorly to the level of the [[hyoid bone]] (or upper border of the epiglottis/floor of vallecula) inferiorly.
*   **Vertebral Correspondence:** Corresponds to the **C2** (axis) and the upper part of the **C3** cervical vertebrae.

### **2. Boundaries**
The [[oropharynx]] communicates anteriorly with the oral cavity through the [[oropharyngeal isthmus]].

| Boundary | Anatomical Structure |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Superior** | Inferior surface of the [[soft palate]] and [[uvula]]. Communicates with the nasopharynx via the [[nasopharyngeal isthmus]] (velopharyngeal isthmus). |
| **Inferior** | Level of the [[hyoid bone]]; upper border of the [[epiglottis]]; [[pharyngoepiglottic folds]]. |
| **Anterior** | [[Oropharyngeal isthmus]], base of the tongue (posterior 1/3), [[lingual tonsils]], [[valleculae]], and anterior tonsillar pillars. |
| **Posterior** | Posterior pharyngeal wall (overlying C2 and C3 vertebrae). |
| **Lateral** | [[Palatine tonsils]] situated in the [[tonsillar fossa]], bounded by the anterior and posterior pillars. |

### **3. Key Structures and Subsites**
According to the AJCC, the oropharynx is divided into specific subsites:

#### **A. Base of Tongue (Posterior 1/3)**
*   Located posterior to the [[circumvallate papillae]] and the [[sulcus terminalis]].
*   **Surface:** Irregular surface due to the presence of [[lingual tonsils]] (part of [[Waldeyer's ring]]).
*   **Lymphatics:** Drains bilaterally into the upper deep cervical nodes.
*   **Valleculae:** Paired cup-shaped depressions between the base of the tongue and the anterior surface of the epiglottis. They are separated by the median [[glossoepiglottic fold]] and bounded laterally by the lateral glossoepiglottic folds.

#### **B. Palatine Tonsils (Faucial Tonsils)**
*   Ovoid masses of lymphoid tissue situated in the lateral wall of the oropharynx within the [[tonsillar fossa]].
*   **Boundaries of Tonsillar Fossa:**
    *   **Anterior Pillar:** Formed by the [[palatoglossus muscle]].
    *   **Posterior Pillar:** Formed by the [[palatopharyngeus muscle]].
*   **Tonsillar Bed:** Formed by the [[superior constrictor muscle]] and [[styloglossus muscle]]. The [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] (CN IX) and the [[styloid process]] lie in close relation to the lower part of the tonsillar fossa.
*   **Blood Supply:** Main supply is the **tonsillar branch of the [[facial artery]]**. Additional supply from the lingual, ascending pharyngeal, and ascending palatine arteries.
*   **Grading of Enlargement:**
    *   **Brodsky/Friedman Grading:**
        *   **Grade 0:** Surgically removed.
        *   **Grade 1:** Within the tonsillar fossa (<25%).
        *   **Grade 2:** Beyond pillars (<50%).
        *   **Grade 3:** Up to 75% of oropharyngeal width.
        *   **Grade 4:** Kissing tonsils (>75%).

#### **C. Soft Palate and Uvula**
*   Forms the roof of the oropharynx.
*   Acts as a valve to close the [[nasopharyngeal isthmus]] during swallowing and speech to prevent nasal regurgitation and [[hypernasality]].

#### **D. Posterior Pharyngeal Wall**
*   Extends from the level of the hard palate to the hyoid bone.

### **4. Histology and Lining**
*   The oropharynx is lined by **non-keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium**.
*   This differs from the nasopharynx, which is lined by ciliated columnar epithelium (respiratory epithelium).

---

### **5. Nerve Supply**
*   **Sensory Supply:** Primarily by the **[[glossopharyngeal nerve]] (CN IX)**.
    *   *Clinical Implication:* Pain from the oropharynx (e.g., tonsillitis or carcinoma of the base of tongue) is often referred to the ear (otalgia) via the tympanic branch of CN IX (Jacobson's nerve).
*   **Motor Supply:** The muscles of the pharynx (constrictors, palatopharyngeus, salpingopharyngeus) are supplied by the **pharyngeal plexus** (formed by CN IX, X, and XI).
    *   *Exception:* The [[stylopharyngeus muscle]] is supplied directly by the **[[glossopharyngeal nerve]]**.

---

### **6. Lymphatic Drainage**
The oropharynx has a rich lymphatic network, which is significant for the spread of malignancies.
*   **Primary Drainage:** [[Jugulodigastric nodes]] (Level II) and upper deep cervical nodes.
*   **Retropharyngeal Nodes:** Soft palate and posterior wall also drain here.
*   **Base of Tongue:** Has extensive bilateral drainage, meaning tumors here frequently metastasize to both sides of the neck.

### **7. Physiology and Functions**
1.  **Deglutition (Swallowing):** It is the common pathway for air and food. During the pharyngeal phase of swallowing, the oropharynx propels the food bolus into the esophagus while the airway is protected.
2.  **Respiration:** Conducts air between the nasopharynx and the larynx.
3.  **Speech:** Acts as a resonating chamber. The [[soft palate]] modulates sound and prevents nasal escape (preventing rhinolalia aperta).
4.  **Taste:** Taste buds are present on the base of the tongue, soft palate, and anterior pillars.
5.  **Immunity:** Contains components of **[[Waldeyer's ring]]** (palatine tonsils and lingual tonsils), which act as the first line of defense against pathogens.

### **8. Clinical Evaluation**
*   **Inspection:** A [[tongue depressor]] is used to visualize the tonsils, pillars, and posterior pharyngeal wall.
    *   *Movement:* Ask the patient to say "Aa" to check the symmetry and elevation of the soft palate and uvula.
*   **Palpation:** **Essential** for the base of the tongue and tonsillar fossa. Tumors in the base of the tongue can be endophytic and "silent," often missed on inspection but detectable as induration on palpation.
*   **Endoscopy:** Flexible or rigid endoscopy is used to visualize the "hidden areas" like the valleculae and base of tongue.

### **9. Common Pathologies**
*   **Infections:**
    *   **Acute Tonsillitis:** Inflammation of palatine tonsils (viral or bacterial like GABHS).
    *   **Peritonsillar Abscess (Quinsy):** Pus accumulation in the [[peritonsillar space]] (between the tonsil capsule and superior constrictor).
*   **Malignancy:**
    *   **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC):** The most common malignancy (90%). Common sites are the tonsil and base of tongue.
    *   **HPV Association:** Human Papillomavirus (specifically p16+) is a major risk factor for oropharyngeal carcinoma and generally carries a better prognosis than smoking/alcohol-related cancers.
    *   **Lymphoma:** Often presents as unilateral tonsillar enlargement.
