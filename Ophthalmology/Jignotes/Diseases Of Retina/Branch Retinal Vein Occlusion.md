# Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO)

**Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO)** is the occlusion of a branch of the [[central retinal vein]], resulting in lobular or sectoral hemorrhages and retinal edema. It is more common than [[Central Retinal Vein Occlusion]] (CRVO).

### Etiopathogenesis

The primary mechanism involves mechanical compression of the vein by a thickened artery.

1.  **Anatomical Basis:**
    *   Occlusion typically occurs at **Arteriovenous (A-V) crossings**.
    *   At these crossings, the retinal artery and vein share a **common adventitial sheath**.
    *   In cases of [[arteriosclerosis]] or [[systemic hypertension]], the thickened, rigid artery compresses the underlying vein.
    *   This compression causes turbulence in blood flow, endothelial damage, and subsequent thrombus formation.

2.  **Risk Factors:**
    *   **Systemic Hypertension:** The most significant risk factor.
    *   **Age:** Typically affects elderly patients (6th to 7th decade).
    *   **Hypermetropia:** Increased risk compared to other refractive errors.
    *   **Others:** Diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and smoking.

### Classification

BRVO can be classified based on the area of retinal involvement:
*   **Hemispheric Occlusion:** Blockage involving the main branch at the optic disc.
*   **Quadrantic Occlusion:** Blockage at the level of A-V crossing.
*   **Small Branch Occlusion:** Can be a macular branch occlusion or a peripheral branch occlusion.

### Clinical Features

The condition is usually unilateral.

**Symptoms:**
*   **Sudden painless loss of vision:** This occurs only if the macular area is involved.
*   **Sectoral visual field defect:** Corresponding to the area of the blocked vessel.
*   **Asymptomatic:** If the occlusion involves a peripheral branch sparing the macula.

**Signs (Fundus Examination):**
*   **Site:** The **Superotemporal quadrant** is the most common site of occlusion.
*   **Retinal Hemorrhages:** Superficial flame-shaped and dot/blot hemorrhages restricted to the area drained by the affected vein.
*   **Retinal Edema:** Segmental edema in the affected quadrant.
*   **Cotton Wool Spots:** Soft exudates indicating ischemia in the nerve fiber layer.
*   **Veins:** The affected vein distal to the occlusion is dilated and tortuous.

### Natural Course and Complications

The natural history varies, but specific complications can significantly threaten vision.

1.  **Chronic Macular Edema:** The most common cause of persistent poor vision. It occurs in about one-third of cases.
2.  **Neovascularization:**
    *   **Neovascularization Elsewhere ([[NVE]]):** More common than NVD. Development of abnormal fragile vessels in the retina supplied by the occluded vein.
    *   **Vitreous Hemorrhage:** Occurs if the new vessels bleed.
3.  **Collateral Formation:** Over time, collateral channels may form between the obstructed vein and adjacent patent venules to bypass the blockage.
4.  **Secondary Glaucoma:** Rare in BRVO compared to CRVO.

**Clinical Implication:**
Eyes with **intact perifoveal capillary arcades** on angiography generally have a better visual prognosis than those with incomplete arcades.

### Investigations

1.  **Fundus Fluorescein Angiography ([[FFA]]):**
    *   **Timing:** Usually performed after the resolution of retinal hemorrhages (which mask details).
    *   **Findings:**
        *   Delayed venous return in the affected sector.
        *   **Capillary Non-Perfusion (CNP):** Areas of ischemia.
        *   **Leakage:** Identifies [[macular edema]] or neovascularization.
        *   **Broken foveal arcade:** Indicates poor visual prognosis.

2.  **Optical Coherence Tomography ([[OCT]]):**
    *   Gold standard for quantifying **Macular Edema** and sub-retinal fluid.
    *   Used to monitor response to treatment.

3.  **Systemic Workup:** Check for hypertension, diabetes, lipid profile, and hypercoagulative states (especially in young patients).

### Management

The goal is to prevent complications and manage visual loss.

#### 1. Medical Therapy (Systemic)
*   Control of systemic risk factors (Hypertension, Diabetes, Hyperlipidemia).

#### 2. Management of Macular Edema
Treatment is indicated if vision is significantly reduced.

| Modality | Agent/Procedure | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Intravitreal Anti-VEGF** | **Ranibizumab** or **Bevacizumab** | Current first-line therapy. Requires repeated injections. |
| **Intravitreal Steroids** | **Triamcinolone Acetonide** or **Dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex)** | Effective for edema but carries risk of cataract and glaucoma. |
| **Laser Therapy** | **Grid Photocoagulation** | Specifically for persistent edema in BRVO (not recommended for CRVO). Now considered second-line or for recalcitrant cases. |

#### 3. Management of Neovascularization
*   **Scatter Laser Photocoagulation:** Indicated if **Neovascularization Elsewhere (NVE)** develops. It involves applying laser burns to the ischemic sector of the retina to reduce the drive for new vessel growth.
*   **Vitrectomy:** Required for non-resolving [[vitreous hemorrhage]] or tractional [[retinal detachment]].
