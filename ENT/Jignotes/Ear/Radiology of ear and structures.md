### Radiology of Ear and Structures

Radiological evaluation of the [[temporal bone]] and ear structures is critical for diagnosing pathology, surgical planning, and assessing complications. The modalities range from conventional plain X-rays to advanced cross-sectional imaging like [[HRCT]] and [[MRI]].

---

### 1. Conventional Radiography (Plain X-rays)
Although largely superseded by CT, plain radiographs are still relevant for assessing mastoid pneumatization and cochlear implants.

#### A. Lateral Oblique Views
These views are designed to visualize the mastoid air cells and the temporomandibular joint (TMJ).

| View | Angulation | Structures Visualized | Clinical Utility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Law’s View]]** | Sagittal plane parallel to film; X-ray beam **15° cephalocaudal**, | • [[External Auditory Canal]] (EAC) superimposed on Internal Auditory Canal (IAC) <br>• Mastoid air cells <br>• Tegmen <br>• Lateral sinus plate, | • General assessment of mastoid cells <br>• **Note:** "Key area" (attic/antrum) is **not** well seen. |
| **[[Schuller’s View]]** | Similar to Law’s but beam is **30° cephalocaudal**, | • **Key area** (Antrum and upper attic) <br>• Sinodural angle <br>• Condyle of mandible <br>• Trabecular pattern, | • **Extent of pneumatization** <br>• Destruction of intercellular septa ([[Mastoiditis]]) <br>• **Cholesteatoma** <br>• Longitudinal fractures, |

#### B. Anteroposterior and Oblique Views

    *   **Utility:** [[Acoustic Neuroma]], apical petrositis.

*   **[[Transorbital View]]**
    *   **Position:** X-ray beam passes through the orbit.
    *   **Structures Seen:** IAM, cochlea, labyrinth, petrous pyramid.
    *   **Utility:** Comparing both petrous pyramids; Acoustic neuroma.

*   **[[Submentovertical View]] (Base View)**
    *   **Position:** Vertex near film; beam from submental area.
    *   **Structures Seen:** Middle ear cleft, [[Eustachian tube]], foramina (ovale, spinosum).

### 2. Computed Tomography (CT)
[[High Resolution CT]] (HRCT) of the temporal bone is the **gold standard** for bony anatomy and middle ear pathologies.

**Standard Protocols:**
*   **Slices:** Thin sections (1–1.5 mm).
*   **Planes:** Axial and Coronal (Coronal is best for tegmen and ossicular chain).

**Clinical Applications & Findings:**

*   **[[Cholesteatoma]]**
    *   **Scutum erosion:** Blunting or destruction of the sharp bony spur (scutum),.
    *   **Ossicular erosion:** Most commonly the long process of the [[incus]].
    *   **Soft tissue mass:** In Prussak's space or mesotympanum.
    *   **Expansion:** Widening of the [[aditus ad antrum]].
    *   **Complications:** Erosion of the [[lateral semicircular canal]] (fistula), tegmen dehiscence (risk of brain abscess), or facial canal dehiscence.

*   **[[Mastoiditis]]**
    *   **Acute:** Clouding of air cells due to exudate/fluid,.
    *   **Coalescent:** Destruction of intercellular bony septa (demineralization),.
    *   **Complications:** Subperiosteal abscess (cortical erosion), [[sigmoid sinus thrombosis]].

*   **[[Otosclerosis]]**
    *   **Fenestral:** Radiolucent focus at the anterior margin of the [[oval window]] (fissula ante fenestram).
    *   **Cochlear:** **Double Ring Sign** (low density halo around the cochlea due to demineralization),.

*   **[[Glomus Tumors]] (Paragangliomas)**
    *   **Glomus Tympanicum:** Soft tissue mass on the [[promontory]] with intact jugular bulb.
    *   **Glomus Jugulare:** Erosion of the **carotico-jugular spine** (bone between carotid canal and jugular fossa) $\rightarrow$ **[[Phelps sign]]**,. Moth-eaten bony destruction.

*   **[[Temporal Bone Fractures]]**
    *   **Longitudinal (80%):** Runs along the axis of petrous bone. Associated with conductive hearing loss (ossicular dislocation) and bleeding,.
    *   **Transverse (20%):** Perpendicular to petrous axis. Associated with sensorineural hearing loss (labyrinthine injury) and facial nerve palsy (50% risk),,.

### 3. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
MRI provides superior soft-tissue contrast and is the investigation of choice for retrocochlear and intracranial pathologies.

**Clinical Applications:**

*   **[[Vestibular Schwannoma]] (Acoustic Neuroma)**
    *   **Gold Standard:** Gadolinium-enhanced MRI,.
    *   **Appearance:** Enhancing mass in the CP angle extending into the [[Internal Auditory Canal]] (IAC).
    *   **Sign:** **[[Ice Cream Cone Sign]]** (Intracanalicular part is the cone; CP angle part is the ice cream).
    *   **Sequences:** T1 (low/intermediate), T2 (heterogeneous/low), T1+Gadolinium (intense enhancement).

*   **[[Cholesteatoma]] (Recurrent)**
    *   **Diffusion Weighted MRI (DWI):** Specifically non-echo planar sequences are used to detect residual or recurrent cholesteatoma (high signal due to restricted diffusion),. It differentiates cholesteatoma from granulation tissue or fluid/mucosa.

*   **Intracranial Complications of CSOM**
    *   **[[Lateral Sinus Thrombophlebitis]]:** MRI Venography (MRV) is useful.
    *   **Delta Sign:** On contrast MRI (or CT), the thrombus appears as a central non-enhancing area surrounded by enhancing dura (empty triangle),,.
    *   **Brain Abscess:** Ring-enhancing lesion with surrounding edema.

*   **Inner Ear Anomalies**
    *   Assesses fluid-filled spaces (membranous labyrinth) which are not seen on CT.
    *   Used to diagnose [[Michel aplasia]] (complete absence) vs. labyrinthine ossification,.

### 4. Angiography and Other Modalities

*   **Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA):**
    *   **Gold standard** for vascular evaluation.
    *   **Indication:** [[Glomus tumors]] and [[Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma]] (JNA).
    *   **Purpose:** Identifies feeding vessels (e.g., ascending pharyngeal artery) and allows for pre-operative **embolization**,.
    *   **Tumor Blush:** Characteristic vascular stain seen in highly vascular tumors.

*   **Positron Emission Tomography (PET):**
    *   Used for distant metastases and recurrence surveillance in malignancies.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Pregnancy:** CT is contraindicated; MRI (avoiding first trimester if possible) is safer, but gadolinium crosses the placenta. Ultrasound is safe but limited for ear structures,.
*   **Implants:** Conventional MRI is contraindicated in patients with non-MRI compatible cochlear implants or metallic foreign bodies.
*   **Facial Nerve:** HRCT is best for traumatic nerve injury (fracture lines); MRI is best for Bell's palsy or tumors (enhancement),.
