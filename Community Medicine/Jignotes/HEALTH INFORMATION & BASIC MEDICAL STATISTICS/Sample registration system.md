# [[HEALTH INFORMATION & BASIC MEDICAL STATISTICS]] > Sample registration system

### Sample Registration System (SRS)

The **[[Sample Registration System]] (SRS)** is a large-scale demographic survey conducted in India to provide reliable annual estimates of birth rate, death rate, and other fertility and mortality indicators at the national and state levels. 

In the absence of a fully functional and complete [[Civil Registration System]] (CRS), the SRS serves as the primary source of fertility and mortality data in India.

#### **History and Scope**
*   **Initiated:** Pilot basis in 1964-65; fully operational from 1969-70.
*   **Authority:** Conducted by the Office of the **[[Registrar General of India]]**, Ministry of Home Affairs.
*   **Coverage:** Covers the entire country (both rural and urban areas).

#### **Methodology: The Dual Record System**
The unique feature of SRS is the **Dual Record System**, which consists of two independent methods of data collection to minimize errors and omissions.

1.  **Continuous Enumeration (Field Investigation):**
    *   Carried out by a resident part-time **[[enumerator]]** (usually a local school teacher or ASHA).
    *   They maintain a continuous record of births and deaths as they occur in the sample unit.

2.  **Independent Retrospective Survey:**
    *   Carried out every **6 months** by a full-time **[[supervisor]]**.
    *   This is an independent check where the supervisor visits households to record vital events retrospectively.

3.  **Matching and Verification:**
    *   Data from the enumerator and the supervisor are matched.
    *   **Unmatched or partially matched events** are re-verified in the field.
    *   An unduplicated count of births and deaths is obtained to calculate reliable rates.

#### **Sample Design**
*   **Technique:** [[Stratified Random Sampling]].
*   **Sample Unit:**
    *   **Rural:** A village or a segment of a village (if population > 1500).
    *   **Urban:** A census enumeration block (population approx. 750-1000).

#### **Key Indicators Provided by SRS**
SRS provides valid and reliable estimates for:
*   **[[Crude Birth Rate]] (CBR)**
*   **[[Crude Death Rate]] (CDR)**
*   **[[Infant Mortality Rate]] (IMR)**
*   **[[Maternal Mortality Ratio]] (MMR)**
*   **[[Total Fertility Rate]] (TFR)**
*   **[[Sex Ratio]]**
*   Under-five Mortality Rate (U5MR).

> **Note:** Since 2004, SRS has incorporated **Verbal Autopsy** (known as **RHIME** - Representative, Re-sampled, Routine Household Interview of Mortality with Medical Evaluation) to determine the *cause of death*.

#### **Advantages**
*   **Reliability:** Due to the dual-check mechanism, it eliminates duplication and reduces omission errors.
*   **Assessment:** It allows for a quantitative assessment of the sources of distortion in records.
*   **Monitoring:** It is the primary source for tracking progress towards **[[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs)** related to IMR and MMR in India.

### **Mnemonic for SRS Methodology**

To remember the Dual Record System: **"C-R-M"**

*   **C** - **C**ontinuous Enumeration (by Enumerator)
*   **R** - **R**etrospective Survey (every 6 months by Supervisor)
*   **M** - **M**atching (of data to get final results)
