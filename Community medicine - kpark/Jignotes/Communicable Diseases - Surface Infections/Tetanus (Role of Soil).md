# [[Communicable Diseases - Surface Infections]] > Tetanus (Role of Soil)

### **TETANUS (LOCKJAW)**

Tetanus is an acute, often fatal disease caused by an exotoxin produced by [[Clostridium tetani]]. It is characterized by generalized rigidity and convulsive spasms of skeletal muscles. Unlike many other communicable diseases, it is a **positive environmental hazard**.

### **Role of Soil (Reservoir and Source)**
*   **Natural Habitat:** The natural habitat of the organism is **soil and dust**.
*   **Reservoir:** The intestine of herbivorous animals (cattle, horses, goats, sheep) contains the bacilli, which are excreted in feces.
*   **Contamination:** Soil fertilized with animal manure is heavily contaminated. The [[spores]] found in the soil are highly resistant and can survive for years in nature, withstanding boiling and drying.
*   **Source:** Infection is acquired when soil or dust containing these spores enters the body through a break in the mucosal or cutaneous barrier.

---

### **Epidemiological Determinants**

**1. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** [[Clostridium tetani]] (Gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-bearing bacillus).
*   **Appearance:** "Drumstick" appearance due to terminal spores.
*   **Toxin:** Produces a powerful exotoxin called **[[Tetanospasmin]]** (second most lethal toxin after Botulinum).
*   **Action:** The toxin blocks the inhibition of spinal reflexes, leading to spastic paralysis.
*   **Communicability:** **None.** There is **NO** person-to-person transmission. It is an infectious disease but *not* a contagious one.

**2. Host Factors**
*   **Age:** Commonly affects the active age group (5–40 years) due to trauma.
*   **Sex:** Higher incidence in males (occupational exposure), but females are at risk during delivery ([[Puerperal Tetanus]]).
*   **Immunity:** **No herd immunity** exists. Immunity is *only* acquired through active immunization (Tetanus Toxoid). Recovery from clinical tetanus does *not* confer natural immunity (the toxin dose causing disease is too low to stimulate antibodies).

**3. Environmental Factors**
*   Rural areas with agricultural practices.
*   Use of cow dung/ash on umbilical stumps or wounds.
*   Lack of aseptic procedures during delivery.

### **Mode of Transmission**
Infection occurs via contamination of wounds with **spores**.
*   **Traumatic:** Puncture wounds, abrasions, compound fractures, burns, animal bites.
*   **Neonatal:** Infection of the umbilical stump ([[Tetanus Neonatorum]]).
*   **Puerperal:** Post-abortion or post-delivery infection of the uterus.
*   **Otogenic:** Introduction of foreign bodies/sticks into the ear.
*   **Idiopathic:** No history of injury (microscopic trauma).

### **Incubation Period**
*   **Range:** 6 to 10 days (Can be 1 day to several months).
*   **Prognosis:** The shorter the incubation period, the **worse** the prognosis.
*   **Clinical Rule:** Period of Onset (time from first symptom to first reflex spasm) < 48 hours indicates a poor prognosis.

---

### **Clinical Picture**
*   **Trismus (Lockjaw):** Usually the first symptom; spasm of masseter muscles.
*   **Risus Sardonicus:** Grimacing smile due to facial muscle spasm.
*   **Opisthotonos:** Arched back due to rigidity of neck and back muscles.
*   **Neonatal Tetanus:** Known as the **[[8th Day Disease]]**. The baby stops sucking and becomes rigid around the 7th–8th day of life.

### **Diagnosis**
*   Primarily **Clinical**.
*   Laboratory confirmation is rarely used for treatment decisions; culture of C. tetani from wounds is difficult.

### **Prevention and Control**

#### **1. Active Immunization**
*   **Vaccine:** [[Tetanus Toxoid]] (TT) or Td (Tetanus-Adult diphtheria).
*   **Type:** Toxoid (Formalin-inactivated toxin).
*   **Adjuvant:** Aluminum phosphate or hydroxide to increase immunogenicity.
*   **Schedule (Universal Immunization Programme - India):**
    *   **Pentavalent:** 6, 10, 14 weeks.
    *   **DPT Booster:** 16–24 months.
    *   **DPT Booster 2:** 5–6 years.
    *   **Td:** 10 years and 16 years.
    *   **Pregnancy:** Td-1 early in pregnancy, Td-2 after 4 weeks (or Td Booster if vaccinated within last 3 years).

#### **2. Prevention of Neonatal Tetanus (The "Cleans")**
To eliminate neonatal tetanus (<1 case per 1000 live births), the **[[5 Cleans]]** (now updated to **7 Cleans**) must be followed during delivery:
1.  **Clean Hands** (Attendant)
2.  **Clean Surface** (Delivery)
3.  **Clean Blade** (Cord cutting)
4.  **Clean Tie** (Cord ligation)
5.  **Clean Stump** (No application of cow dung/ash)
6.  *Clean Water* (For washing)
7.  *Clean Towel* (For drying)

#### **3. Prevention After Injury (Post-Exposure Prophylaxis)**
Treatment depends on the nature of the wound and immunity status.

| **Immunity Category** | **Clean, Non-Penetrating Wounds (<6 hours old)** | **All Other Wounds (Contaminated, Puncture, >6 hours)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A** (Complete course/booster < 5 years ago) | Nothing required | Nothing required |
| **B** (Complete course/booster > 5 but < 10 years ago) | **Toxoid 1 dose** | **Toxoid 1 dose** |
| **C** (Complete course/booster > 10 years ago) | **Toxoid 1 dose** | **Toxoid 1 dose** + **[[Human Tetanus Ig]]** |
| **D** (Unknown status or < 3 doses) | **Complete Course of TT** | **Complete Course of TT** + **[[Human Tetanus Ig]]** |

*   *Note: Human Tetanus Immunoglobulin (TIG) dose is usually 250 IU IM. If TIG is unavailable, Equine Anti-Tetanus Serum (ATS) 1500 IU is used after sensitivity testing.*

---

### **Treatment of Clinical Tetanus**
1.  **Neutralization of Toxin:** Injection of **[[Human Tetanus Immunoglobulin]] (TIG)** 3000–6000 IU IM to neutralize unbound toxin.
2.  **Antibiotics:** Metronidazole (preferred) or Penicillin G to kill vegetative bacteria and stop toxin production.
3.  **Wound Care:** Surgical debridement of the wound *after* antitoxin administration.
4.  **Control of Spasms:** Sedatives (Benzodiazepines), muscle relaxants.
5.  **Supportive Care:** Dark, quiet room (to prevent stimulus-induced spasms), airway maintenance (tracheostomy if needed), hydration.

> **Mnemonic for Tetanus Prevention in Wounds:**
> **"C-D" Rule**
> *   If the wound is **C**lean: Boost if last dose > **10** years (Decade).
> *   If the wound is **D**irty: Boost if last dose > **5** years.

**Clinical Relevance:**
Never rely on "Herd Immunity" for Tetanus. It is the only vaccine-preventable disease that is infectious but not contagious. Individual protection via immunization is mandatory.
