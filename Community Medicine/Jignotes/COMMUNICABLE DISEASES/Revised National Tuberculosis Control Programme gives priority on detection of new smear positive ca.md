# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme gives priority on detection of new smear positive cases.

### Rationale for Prioritizing New Smear-Positive Cases in [[RNTCP]]

The [[Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme]] (RNTCP), now known as the [[National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme]] (NTEP), fundamentally shifted its focus from mere early diagnosis (as in the previous NTP) to **breaking the chain of transmission**. This is achieved by prioritizing the detection and cure of **New Smear-Positive** pulmonary tuberculosis cases.

#### 1. Epidemiological Justification
The highest priority is given to these cases for the following reasons:
*   **Source of Infection:** Sputum smear-positive patients are the most infectious sources in the community. They excrete large numbers of tubercle bacilli.
*   **Transmission Potential:** An untreated infectious pulmonary TB patient infects an estimated **10–15 persons** annually,.
*   **Pool of Infection:** These cases contribute most to the "pool of infection" every year. Targeting them is the most effective way to cut the [[chain of transmission]],.
*   **Lower Infectivity of Others:** Patients with sputum smear-negative or extra-pulmonary tuberculosis constitute a minimal hazard for the transmission of infection compared to smear-positive cases.

#### 2. Program Objectives (The 85/70 Goal)
To control TB effectively, RNTCP set specific operational targets focused on this group:
*   **Curative Target:** To achieve a **cure rate of at least 85%** among newly detected infectious cases (new sputum smear-positive),,.
*   **Detection Target:** To achieve a **case detection rate of at least 70%** of such estimated cases in the population,.
*   **Logic:** The target for case detection is attempted only *after* achieving the high cure rate to prevent the creation of drug-resistant strains due to poor management of identified cases.

#### 3. Diagnostic Strategy
*   **Passive Case Finding:** The program emphasizes identifying cases among patients who present to health facilities on their own with symptoms (chest symptomatics), rather than active door-to-door surveys which are costly and yield fewer cases.
*   **Tool of Choice:** [[Sputum Smear Microscopy]] using **Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining** is the primary case-finding tool. It is reliable, cheap, and identifies the *epidemiologically most important* cases (those excreting >10,000 bacilli/ml),.
*   **[[DOTS]] Strategy:** Once detected, these patients are treated with Short Course Chemotherapy under direct supervision to ensure cure.

#### 4. Case Definitions
To ensure prioritization, the patients are classified precisely:
*   **New Case:** A TB patient who has never had treatment for tuberculosis or has taken anti-tuberculosis drugs for less than one month,.
*   **Smear-Positive Case:** A patient with at least **one** initial sputum smear examination positive for [[Acid-Fast Bacilli]] (AFB),.

#### Clinical Relevance
**Why not just X-ray?**
Chest X-rays are non-specific. Relying on X-rays alone leads to over-diagnosis. Sputum smear positivity indicates a high **bacillary load**, making the patient highly infectious. Prioritizing these patients prevents the spread of the disease to family and community members, which is the core principle of public health disease control,.
