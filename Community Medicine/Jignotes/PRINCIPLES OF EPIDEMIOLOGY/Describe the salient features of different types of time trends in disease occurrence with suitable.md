# [[PRINCIPLES OF EPIDEMIOLOGY]] > Describe the salient features of different types of time trends in disease occurrence with suitable examples. What are the different possible changes over time that you should keep in mind while interpreting time trends?

### Time Trends in Disease Occurrence

Epidemiologists study the distribution of disease over time to identify whether a disease is seasonal, periodic, or follows a consistent long-term trend. This helps in formulating **[[aetiological hypotheses]]** and planning control measures.

There are three major types of fluctuations in disease occurrence:

---

#### I. Short-Term Fluctuations (Epidemics)
An **[[epidemic]]** is defined as the occurrence of cases of an illness in a community or region clearly in excess of **[[normal expectancy]]**. There are three major types:

**A. Common-Source Epidemics**
1.  **Single Exposure (Point Source) Epidemics:**
    *   **Feature:** The exposure to the disease agent is brief and simultaneous.
    *   **Curve:** The epidemic curve rises and falls rapidly (explosive) with **no secondary waves**.
    *   **Time:** All cases develop within **one incubation period** of the disease.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   **Food poisoning** (e.g., Staphylococcal).
        *   **[[Bhopal Gas Tragedy]]** (Industrial chemical exposure).
        *   **Measles** or **Chickenpox** from a single index case in a classroom.

2.  **Continuous or Repeated Exposure Epidemics:**
    *   **Feature:** Exposure from the same source is prolonged or intermittent.
    *   **Curve:** The rise is sharp, but the fall may be interrupted, or the epidemic continues beyond one incubation period.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   A well of contaminated water used by a village.
        *   A prostitute infecting clients with **Gonorrhoea** over a period of time.
        *   **Legionnaire’s disease** outbreak in Philadelphia (1976).

**B. Propagated Epidemics**
*   **Feature:** Results from **person-to-person transmission** of an infectious agent.
*   **Curve:** Shows a gradual rise and tails off over a much longer period. Transmission continues until the number of **[[susceptibles]]** is depleted or **[[herd immunity]]** is achieved.
*   **Examples:** Epidemics of **[[Hepatitis A]]**, **[[Polio]]**, and **[[HIV]]**,.

**C. Slow (Modern) Epidemics**
*   **Feature:** Appearance of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in epidemic proportions due to lifestyle changes.
*   **Examples:** **[[Diabetes]]**, **[[Ischaemic Heart Disease]]**.

#### II. Periodic Fluctuations
These are predictable changes in disease frequency over time.

**1. Seasonal Trend**
*   **Feature:** A well-known characteristic of communicable diseases related to environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, rainfall) which favour disease transmission or vector breeding.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **[[Measles]]/Varicella:** Peak in early spring.
    *   **GI Infections:** Prominent in summer (flies/heat).
    *   **Upper Respiratory Infections:** Rise during winter.
    *   **[[Dengue]]/Malaria:** Peak post-monsoon (vector breeding).

**2. Cyclic Trend**
*   **Feature:** Diseases occur in cycles spread over short periods (days, weeks, months) or years. This is often due to natural variations in **[[herd immunity]]** or antigenic shifts,.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Measles:** Pre-vaccination cycles every 2–3 years.
    *   **Rubella:** Epidemics every 6–9 years.
    *   **[[Influenza]] Pandemics:** Occur at intervals of 7–10 (or 10–40) years due to antigenic shift/drift,.
    *   **Non-infectious:** Automobile accidents are more frequent on weekends.

---

#### III. Long-Term or Secular Trends
*   **Feature:** Implies changes in disease occurrence (progressive increase or decrease) over a long period, generally several years or decades.
*   **Interpretation:** It indicates a consistent tendency to change in a particular direction.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Consistent Increase:** **[[Lung cancer]]**, **[[Coronary Heart Disease]]** (CHD), and Diabetes in developed countries over the last 50 years.
    *   **Consistent Decrease:** **[[Tuberculosis]]**, **[[Typhoid]]**, Diphtheria, and Polio due to better public health measures.

### Comparison of Epidemic Types

| Feature | Common Source (Single Exposure) | Propagated Epidemic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Exposure** | Brief, simultaneous | Person-to-person contact |
| **Rise of cases** | Explosive / Rapid | Gradual |
| **Fall of cases** | Rapid | Gradual (tails off) |
| **Secondary waves** | Absent | Present |
| **Duration** | Within one incubation period | Beyond one incubation period |
| **Example** | **[[Food Poisoning]]** | **[[Chickenpox]]** |

### Interpretation of Time Trends

When analyzing changes in disease trends over time, an epidemiologist must determine if the change is **REAL** or **APPARENT** (spurious).

**Factors to keep in mind while interpreting trends:**

1.  **Changes in Diagnosis:** Advances in diagnostic technology or changes in case definitions can artificially increase prevalence (e.g., better detection of cancer).
2.  **Changes in Reporting:** Improvement in notification systems or reporting accuracy may look like a rise in disease.
3.  **Changes in Case Fatality:** Improvements in treatment may increase survival (duration), thereby increasing prevalence even if incidence is stable.
4.  **Changes in Age Distribution:** As life expectancy increases, the population ages, naturally leading to a rise in degenerative diseases like atherosclerosis.
5.  **Changes in the Agent:** Antigenic variations (e.g., Influenza) or virulence changes.
6.  **Environmental/Social Changes:** Changes in quality of life, socio-economic status, or habits (e.g., smoking patterns).

**Mnemonic for Interpretation: "DREAMS"**
*   **D** - **D**iagnostic criteria changes
*   **R** - **R**eporting accuracy
*   **E** - **E**nvironmental/Social changes
*   **A** - **A**gent modification (virulence/strain)
*   **M** - **M**ortality/Case fatality changes
*   **S** - **S**tructure of population (Age/Demography)
