# [[HEALTH INFORMATION & BASIC MEDICAL STATISTICS]] > Criteria for selection of sampling and methods & registration systems in India

### Criteria for Selection of Sampling Methods

Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of individuals from a population to estimate characteristics of the whole population. The choice of method depends on the nature of the population, resources available, and the degree of precision required.

#### 1. Essentials of a Good Sample
To ensure the results are valid and applicable to the population, the sample must be:
*   **Representative:** It should reflect the characteristics of the parent population.
*   **Adequate Size:** Large enough to reduce [[Sampling Error]].
*   **Unbiased:** Selection should not be influenced by human choice.

#### 2. Criteria for Selecting Specific Sampling Methods

| **Sampling Method** | **Criteria for Selection / Indication** | **Advantages/Disadvantages** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Simple Random Sampling]]** | • Population is small and **homogeneous**.<br>• Complete list of population (Sampling Frame) is available.<br>• Every unit has an equal chance of selection. | **+** Most statistically valid.<br>**-** Hard to execute in large/scattered populations. |
| **[[Systematic Random Sampling]]** | • Complete list of units is available.<br>• Units are arranged in some order (e.g., Hospital registers, OPD tickets, House numbers).<br>• Selection is based on **Sampling Interval (K)**. | **+** Easy and convenient.<br>**-** Bias possible if there is a periodic fluctuation in data. |
| **[[Stratified Random Sampling]]** | • Population is **heterogeneous** (mixed).<br>• Need to represent subgroups (strata) like age, sex, or socioeconomic status accurately.<br>• Sample drawn from each stratum randomly. | **+** Greater precision; ensures no subgroup is missed.<br>**-** Requires accurate knowledge of strata beforehand. |
| **[[Cluster Sampling]]** | • Population is large, scattered, and sampling frame is **not** available.<br>• Units are natural groups (clusters) like villages, wards, or schools.<br>• **Standard used in India:** Evaluation of Immunization Coverage (30 $\times$ 7 technique). | **+** Cheaper, faster, easier in field.<br>**-** Higher sampling error (Design Effect). |
| **[[Multistage Sampling]]** | • Large country-wide surveys.<br>• Sampling done in stages (State $\rightarrow$ District $\rightarrow$ Village $\rightarrow$ Household). | **+** Flexible; uses existing administrative divisions.<br>**-** Complex analysis. |
| **[[Snowball Sampling]]** | • **Hidden populations** or hard-to-reach groups (e.g., Drug users, Commercial sex workers).<br>• Existing subjects recruit future subjects. | **+** Only way to reach hidden groups.<br>**-** Non-probability; high bias. |

### Registration Systems in India

In India, health information is primarily gathered through routine registration of vital events.

#### 1. Civil Registration System (CRS)
*   **Legal Basis:** **[[Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969]]**.
*   **Mandate:** It is **compulsory** to register births and deaths.
*   **Timeline:** Events must be registered within **21 days** of occurrence.
    *   **Late Registration:**
        *   > 21 days to 30 days: With late fee.
        *   > 30 days to 1 year: With written permission from prescribed authority + affidavit.
        *   > 1 year: Only on order of First Class Magistrate.
*   **Current Status:** While mandatory, it suffers from under-reporting in many states. It provides the legal document (Birth/Death Certificate).

#### 2. [[Sample Registration System]] (SRS)
*   **Purpose:** Since CRS data is often incomplete, SRS was initiated (1964-65) to provide **reliable estimates** of fertility and mortality rates (IMR, birth rate, death rate) at the state and national levels.
*   **Methodology:** It is a **Dual Record System**:
    1.  **Continuous Enumeration:** By a local part-time enumerator (e.g., Aanganwadi worker/Teacher).
    2.  **Retrospective Survey:** Every 6 months by a full-time supervisor.
    *   The data from both sources are matched. Unmatched events are re-verified in the field to get the final count.
*   **Significance:** It is currently the *most reliable source* of demographic data in India between censuses.

#### 3. Survey of Causes of Death (Rural)
*   Formerly known as the **Model Registration Scheme (MRS)**.
*   **Objective:** To determine the cause of death in rural areas where doctors are often unavailable to certify death.
*   **Method:** **[[Lay Diagnosis/Reporting]]**. Paramedical staff (like ANM) investigate deaths and assign a probable cause based on symptoms and signs described by relatives (Verbal Autopsy).

#### 4. Notification of Diseases
*   Medical practitioners, hospitals, and householders must report specific "Notifiable Diseases" (e.g., Cholera, Plague, Polio, Dengue) to the local health authority.
*   **Limitation:** Severe under-reporting (Passive surveillance).

#### 5. Hospital Records
*   Provides information on the cause of illness (morbidity) and case fatality rates.
*   **Limitation:** Biased sample (only those who seek care are recorded); denominator (population at risk) is undefined.

### Summary of Vital Statistics Sources

| Source | Key Feature | Primary Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Census]]** | Decennial (Every 10 years) | Population size, distribution, literacy, sex ratio. |
| **CRS** | Statutory (Act of 1969) | Legal proof of birth/death. |
| **SRS** | Dual Record System | Reliable Birth/Death Rates, IMR, MMR. |
| **NFHS** | Large-scale Survey | Family planning, RCH, Nutrition data. |

> **Clinical Relevance:**
> *   **Sampling:** When reading a drug trial or research paper, check the sampling method. If a study on "Prevalence of Diabetes in India" used **hospital patients** (Selection Bias) instead of a **random community sample**, the results are invalid for the general population.
> *   **Registration:** Accurate death certification (mentioning the **Underlying Cause of Death**) by interns and doctors is crucial. This data drives national health policy and funding allocation.
