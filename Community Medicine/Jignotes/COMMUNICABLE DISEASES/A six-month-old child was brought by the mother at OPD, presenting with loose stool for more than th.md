# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > A six-month-old child was brought by the mother at OPD, presenting with loose stool for more than three times with vomiting from last night. On examination, the child was found restless and drinking eagerly. Classify the disease. Outline the management.

### **Classification of the Disease**

Based on the **IMNCI (Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness)** guidelines and the clinical signs provided, the classification is:

**1. Type of Illness:** [[Acute Diarrhoea]]
*   *Definition:* Passage of loose or watery stools more than three times a day for less than 14 days.

**2. Hydration Status:** [[Some Dehydration]]
*   *Basis:* The child presents with two key signs from Column B of the assessment chart:
    *   **Restless and Irritable** (Behavior)
    *   **Drinking Eagerly/Thirsty** (Thirst).

| **Assessment Criteria** | **No Dehydration (Plan A)** | **Some Dehydration (Plan B)** | **Severe Dehydration (Plan C)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Look: Condition** | Well, Alert | **Restless, Irritable** | Lethargic or Unconscious |
| **Look: Eyes** | Normal | Sunken | Very Sunken and dry |
| **Look: Thirst** | Drinks normally, not thirsty | **Drinks eagerly, thirsty** | Drinks poorly or unable to drink |
| **Feel: Skin Pinch** | Goes back quickly | Goes back slowly | Goes back very slowly (>2 secs) |
| **Action** | Home Management | **Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT)** | IV Fluids (Urgent) |

### **Management Outline**

Since the child is classified as having **Some Dehydration**, the management follows **Treatment Plan B**.

#### **1. Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT)**
*   **Goal:** Rehydrate the child over a period of **4 hours** at the health center/clinic.
*   **Fluid:** Use [[WHO Reduced Osmolarity ORS]] (Total Osmolarity: 245 mmol/L).
*   **Calculation of Dose:**
    *   **Formula:** Weight (kg) $\times$ 75 ml.
    *   **Age-based estimate (for 6 months):** If weight is unknown, give **400–600 ml** (for 6-9kg child) over 4 hours.
*   **Method of Administration:**
    *   Give frequent small sips from a cup/spoon.
    *   If the child vomits (mentioned in history), wait **10 minutes** and then continue slowly (e.g., a spoonful every 2-3 minutes).
    *   If the child demands more ORS, give more.

#### **2. Zinc Supplementation**
*   **Rationale:** Reduces duration/severity of the episode and prevents recurrence for 2-3 months.
*   **Dosage:** For a 6-month-old child, give **20 mg elemental Zinc** (1 tablet) daily for **14 days**.
*   **Administration:** Dissolve the tablet in a small amount of expressed breast milk or ORS.

#### **3. Nutritional Management**
*   **Breastfeeding:** **Do not stop breastfeeding.** Continue breastfeeding whenever the child wants, in addition to ORS.
*   **Feeding:** If the child is taking semi-solids, continue giving food. Do not withhold food; giving nutrient-rich food prevents malnutrition.

#### **4. Re-assessment**
*   After 4 hours, reassess the child using the "Look, Feel, Decide" chart.
*   **If signs of dehydration are gone:** Shift to **Plan A** (Home management).
*   **If signs persist:** Repeat Plan B.
*   **If worsened (Severe Dehydration):** Shift to **Plan C** (IV fluids).

#### **5. Advice to Mother (Plan A for Home)**
Once rehydrated and ready for discharge, counsel the mother on the **4 Rules of Home Care**:
1.  **Give Extra Fluid:** Breastfeed more frequently; give ORS after every loose stool (50-100 ml for <2 years).
2.  **Give Zinc:** Complete the 14-day course.
3.  **Continue Feeding:** To prevent weight loss/malnutrition.
4.  **When to Return immediately:** If the child develops danger signs:
    *   Drinking poorly or unable to drink.
    *   Becomes sicker.
    *   Develops fever.
    *   Blood in stool.
    *   Repeated vomiting.
