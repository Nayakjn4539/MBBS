# [[Preventive Medicine In Obstetrics, Paediatrics And Geriatrics]] > Low Birth Weight and Kangaroo Mother Care

### Low Birth Weight (LBW)

**Definition**
[[Low Birth Weight]] is defined as a birth weight of **less than 2500 grams** (up to and including 2499 g), regardless of the gestational age.
*   The measurement should preferably be taken within the **first hour of life** before significant postnatal weight loss occurs.
*   **Significance:** It is the single most important determinant of a child's chance of survival, healthy growth, and development.

**Public Health Problem**
*   **Global:** Prevalence is about 15%.
*   **India:** Approximately **18-28%** of babies are LBW (estimates vary by survey).
*   **Mortality:** Infant mortality rate is about **20 times greater** for LBW babies compared to normal weight babies.

#### Classification of LBW
LBW infants are classified into two main groups based on gestational age:

| Type | Definition | Key Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pre-term Babies** | Born before **37 completed weeks** (<259 days) of gestation. | Physiological immaturity. Organs not fully developed. |
| **Small-for-Date (SFD)** | Born at term or post-term but weight is **<10th percentile** for gestational age. | Result of **[[Intrauterine Growth Retardation]] (IUGR)**. Major cause in developing countries like India (60% of LBW cases). |

**Weight-based Sub-classification:**
1.  **Low Birth Weight (LBW):** < 2500 g
2.  **Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW):** < 1500 g
3.  **Extremely Low Birth Weight (ELBW):** < 1000 g

#### Etiology / Risk Factors
The causes are multifactorial, often interacting with each other.

**1. Maternal Factors**
*   **Malnutrition:** Poor maternal weight gain during pregnancy, anemia (Hb < 8 g%).
*   **Age:** Very young (<18 years) or older (>35 years) mothers.
*   **Parity:** High parity and close birth spacing.
*   **Stature:** Short maternal stature (<140 cm).
*   **Habits:** Smoking, tobacco usage, alcohol consumption.
*   **Disease:** Hypertension, Malaria, Toxemia, Chronic illness.

**2. Placental Factors**
*   Placental insufficiency, abnormalities (e.g., placenta previa).

**3. Fetal Factors**
*   Multiple gestation (Twins), Intrauterine infections, Chromosomal abnormalities.

#### Prevention of LBW
Intervention is better than treatment. Strategies include:

**Direct Interventions**
*   **Nutrition:** Supplementary feeding during pregnancy (e.g., [[ICDS]]), Iron and Folic Acid ([[IFA]]) supplementation.
*   **Infection Control:** Treatment of Malaria, UTI, and TORCH infections.
*   **Behavior:** Avoidance of smoking and heavy physical work.

**Indirect Interventions**
*   **Family Planning:** Spacing births and limiting family size.
*   **Sanitation:** Improved general health and hygiene.
*   **Social:** Prevention of early marriage (improving female literacy and status).

### Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC)

**Definition**
[[Kangaroo Mother Care]] is a method of care for **stable low birth weight** babies that involves placing the baby in skin-to-skin contact with the mother. It was introduced in Colombia in 1979 by Drs. Martinez and Rey to combat overcrowding and infection in hospitals.

**Components of KMC**
There are **four** essential components, remembered by the mnemonic **SANE**:

1.  **[[Skin-to-Skin Contact]] (Kangaroo Position):**
    *   The baby is placed between the mother's breasts in a vertical position.
    *   The baby's head is turned to one side to keep the airway clear.
    *   Hips are in a "frog-like" abduction position.
    *   The baby is covered with the mother's clothes/wrap to maintain the **[[Warm Chain]]**.

2.  **[[Exclusive Breastfeeding]] (Nutrition):**
    *   Promotes lactation and facilitates easy feeding on demand.
    *   The close contact increases the mother's milk production.

3.  **Early Discharge (Ambulatory Care):**
    *   Since the mother provides the heat source and nutrition, the baby can be discharged earlier from the hospital, provided the baby is stable and gaining weight.

4.  **Support (Emotional):**
    *   Provides emotional bonding between mother and child.
    *   Family support is crucial for the mother to practice KMC continuously.

#### Eligibility Criteria
*   **Baby:** Hemodynamically stable, LBW (<2000 g). Babies <1200 g usually require NICU care first but can start KMC once stable.
*   **Mother:** Willing, healthy (free from serious infections), and supportive family.

#### Benefits of KMC

| Beneficiary | Advantages |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baby** | • Prevents **[[Hypothermia]]** (Natural incubator).<br>• Reduces nosocomial infections.<br>• Improves weight gain and physiological stability (HR, RR).<br>• Promotes cognitive development. |
| **Mother** | • Increases confidence in handling the small baby.<br>• Promotes **[[Lactation]]**.<br>• Psychological bonding (Bonding effect). |
| **Hospital/Nation** | • Cost-effective (Reduces need for incubators).<br>• Reduces hospital stay and manpower load.<br>• Reduces [[Neonatal Mortality Rate]] (NMR) and IMR. |

#### Duration
*   KMC should be continued for as long as possible, preferably 24 hours a day, interrupted only for changing diapers or maternal hygiene.
*   It is continued until the baby no longer tolerates it (usually when weight reaches ~2500g).

**Clinical Relevance:** 
KMC is the most effective intervention for preventing hypothermia in resource-poor settings where incubators are scarce or electricity is unreliable. It empowers the mother to be the primary caregiver.
