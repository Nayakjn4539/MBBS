# Membranous Conjunctivitis

### Definition
[[Membranous conjunctivitis]] is an acute, severe inflammation of the conjunctiva characterized by the formation of a **true membrane** on the surface of the conjunctiva.
*   **Pathology:** It involves the deposition of fibrinous exudate not only on the surface but also permeating into the superficial layers of the [[conjunctival epithelium]].
*   **Key Feature:** If the membrane is peeled off, it leaves a **raw, bleeding surface** because the epithelium is torn away with the membrane.

### Etiology
It is a rare condition nowadays due to widespread immunization. The causative organisms include:
*   **[[Corynebacterium diphtheriae]]**: The classic and most significant cause.
*   **[[Streptococcus haemolyticus]]** (Virulent type).
*   Rarely by **[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]**.

### Clinical Features
The disease typically affects children between **2 and 8 years of age**, particularly those not immunized against diphtheria. The clinical course is divided into three distinct stages:

#### 1. Stage of Infiltration
*   **Lids:** Swollen, tender, and **hard** (board-like rigidity).
*   **Discharge:** Scanty conjunctival discharge.
*   **Conjunctiva:** Covered by a thick, grey-yellow membrane, primarily on the [[palpebral conjunctiva]].
*   **Membrane Characteristic:** Tough and firmly adherent. Attempts to remove it result in bleeding.
*   **Lymph Nodes:** The [[pre-auricular lymph nodes]] are enlarged and tender.

#### 2. Stage of Suppuration
*   **Pain:** Decreases as the eyelids become softer.
*   **Discharge:** Becomes **copious and purulent**.
*   **Membrane:** The membrane begins to slough off (separate) from the underlying tissue.

#### 3. Stage of Cicatrization (Healing)
*   The raw surface heals by granulation tissue formation.
*   **Scarring:** Extensive conjunctival scarring occurs, leading to cosmetic and functional complications.

> **Clinical Implication:** Any child presenting with a greyish-yellow membrane on the conjunctiva that bleeds on manipulation must be suspected of Diphtheria and isolated immediately until proven otherwise.

### Complications
Complications arise due to severe cicatrization (scarring) or corneal involvement:
*   **[[Symblepharon]]:** Adhesion between palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva.
*   **[[Trichiasis]]** and **[[Entropion]]**: In-turning of eyelashes and eyelid margin due to scarring.
*   **[[Conjunctival xerosis]]:** Drying due to destruction of goblet cells.
*   **Corneal Ulceration:** May occur due to direct toxic action or secondary to trichiasis.

### Differential Diagnosis: True vs. Pseudo-Membranous Conjunctivitis

| Feature | **True Membranous Conjunctivitis** | **Pseudomembranous Conjunctivitis** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pathology** | Fibrinous exudate penetrates epithelium | Coagulated exudate lies *on* the surface |
| **Adherence** | Firmly adherent to conjunctiva | Loosely adherent |
| **Removal** | **Bleeds on removal** (Raw surface) | **Does not bleed** (Epithelium intact) |
| **Main Cause** | *Corynebacterium diphtheriae*, *Strep. haemolyticus* | *Adenovirus*, *Gonococcus*, *Staphylococci*, *Streptococcus*, *Ligneous conjunctivitis* |
| **Prognosis** | Can lead to severe scarring (Symblepharon) | Usually heals without significant scarring |

### Management
The condition is a medical emergency requiring isolation and prompt treatment.

#### 1. Systemic Treatment
*   **[[Anti-diphtheritic serum]] (ADS):** Administered Intramuscularly (IM) immediately (STAT) to neutralize the toxin.
*   **Antibiotics:** Systemic **[[Penicillin]]** (IM injection) is given for 10 days to eliminate the bacteria. Crystalline penicillin or erythromycin are effective.

#### 2. Topical Treatment
*   **Anti-diphtheritic serum (ADS):** Instilled as drops every hour.
*   **Antibiotics:** [[Penicillin]] eye drops (10,000 units/ml) instilled every 30 minutes. Broad-spectrum antibiotic ointments may be used at night.
*   **[[Atropine]]**: Use atropine eye ointment if the cornea is involved to prevent uveal complications.
*   **Irrigation:** Gentle irrigation with saline to remove discharge.

**Note:** Do **not** attempt to forcefully peel the membrane in true membranous conjunctivitis as it increases trauma and bleeding. (Contrast with pseudomembranous conjunctivitis where membrane peeling is therapeutic).

#### 3. General Measures
*   Strict **isolation** of the patient to prevent spread.
*   Bed rest.
