# Seronegative Spondyloarthropathies

### Definition
A group of inflammatory joint diseases (arthritis) characterized by the involvement of the axial skeleton (spine) and peripheral joints, which are serologically negative for [[Rheumatoid Factor]] (RF negative). These conditions share a common genetic association with the [[HLA-B27]] antigen and pathological changes at the entheses (site of tendon/ligament insertion into bone).

### Group of Disorders (Classification)
The clinical entities included in this group are:
*   **[[Ankylosing Spondylitis]]** (The prototype of the group)
*   **[[Reiter's Disease]]** (Reactive Arthritis)
*   **[[Psoriatic Arthritis]]**
*   **[[Enteropathic Arthritis]]** (Associated with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases like [[Ulcerative Colitis]] and [[Crohn's Disease]])
*   **[[Whipple's Disease]]**
*   **[[Behçet's Syndrome]]**
*   **Undifferentiated Spondyloarthropathy**

> **Mnemonic for Seronegative Spondyloarthropathies: PAIR**
> *   **P**soriatic arthritis
> *   **A**nkylosing spondylitis
> *   **I**nflammatory bowel disease arthritis
> *   **R**eactive arthritis (Reiter's)

### General Characteristics
These disorders share the following clinical and genetic features:
*   **Seronegativity:** Absence of Rheumatoid Factor (RF).
*   **Genetic Association:** Strong association with [[HLA-B27]].
*   **Axial Involvement:** Inflammation of the spine ([[Spondylitis]]) and [[Sacroiliac Joints]] ([[Sacroiliitis]]).
*   **Peripheral Arthritis:** Often asymmetrical and predominantly affects the lower limbs.
*   **Pathology:** The primary pathology is **[[Enthesopathy]]** (inflammation at the insertion of ligaments and tendons into bone), leading to fibrosis and ossification.
*   **Extra-articular Features:** Frequent involvement of eyes ([[Uveitis]]), skin, and mucous membranes.
*   **Demographics:** Typically affects young males more than females.

### Ankylosing Spondylitis (Marie-Strumpell Disease)
This is a chronic inflammatory disease mainly affecting the axial skeleton, leading to fusion of the spine.

#### 1. Clinical Features
*   **Age/Sex:** Predominantly young males (< 40 years). Male:Female ratio is high.
*   **Onset:** Insidious.
*   **Pain:**
    *   **Low Back Pain:** The earliest and most common symptom.
    *   **Inflammatory Nature:** Pain is worse at night/early morning and **improves with activity**.
    *   **Morning Stiffness:** Lasts more than 30 minutes.
    *   **Buttock Pain:** Alternating buttock pain suggests [[Sacroiliitis]].
*   **Chest:** Decreased chest expansion (due to costovertebral joint involvement).
*   **Postural Changes:** Loss of lumbar lordosis and increased thoracic kyphosis ("Stooped posture").

#### 2. Extra-articular Manifestations
*   **Eye:** Acute anterior [[Uveitis]] (Iridocyclitis) is the most common extra-articular feature (25-30%).
*   **Cardiovascular:** Aortitis, conduction defects, aortic regurgitation.
*   **Respiratory:** Apical pulmonary fibrosis.
*   **Neurological:** Atlantoaxial subluxation, Cauda equina syndrome.

#### 3. Clinical Examination Tests
*   **[[Schober's Test]]:** To assess lumbar spine mobility.
    *   Mark L5 spinous process and a point 10 cm above it.
    *   Patient bends forward fully.
    *   If the distance increases by less than 5 cm, lumbar flexion is restricted.
*   **Chest Expansion:** Measured at the 4th intercostal space. Restriction (< 2.5 cm) is an early sign.
*   **Sacroiliac Tests:**
    *   **[[Gaenslen's Test]]**
    *   **[[Pump Handle Test]]**
    *   **Figure of 4 Test (Patrick's Test)**
    *   Direct compression of SI joints.

#### 4. Radiological Features (X-ray)
*   **[[Sacroiliitis]]:** The hallmark and usually the earliest sign. Shows erosions, sclerosis, and eventual fusion (ankylosis) of the SI joints.
*   **Spine:**
    *   **Squaring of Vertebrae:** Loss of anterior concavity.
    *   **[[Syndesmophytes]]:** Vertical bony outgrowths bridging the vertebral bodies (ossification of the outer fibers of annulus fibrosus).
    *   **[[Bamboo Spine]]:** Complete fusion of the spine due to bridging syndesmophytes giving a bamboo-stick appearance.
    *   **[[Dagger Sign]]:** A single central radiodense line due to ossification of supraspinous and interspinous ligaments.
    *   **[[Trolley Track Sign]]:** Three vertical dense lines due to ossification of facet joint capsules and ligaments.

> Draw a "Bamboo Spine" appearance showing squaring of vertebrae and vertical syndesmophytes bridging the disc space. Also depict "Dagger sign" as a central radiopaque line.

#### 5. Management
*   **Physical Therapy:** Crucial to maintain posture and mobility. Swimming and extension exercises are encouraged.
*   **NSAIDs:** First-line drug therapy (e.g., Indomethacin, Naproxen) to control pain and stiffness.
*   **DMARDs:** Sulfasalazine may be used for peripheral joint involvement.
*   **Biologicals:** Anti-TNF agents (e.g., Infliximab, Etanercept) are highly effective in resistant cases.
*   **Surgery:** [[Spinal Osteotomy]] may be required for severe kyphotic deformity (e.g., to allow the patient to look forward). Total Hip Replacement for severe hip ankylosis.

### Other Seronegative Spondyloarthropathies

#### 1. Reiter's Disease (Reactive Arthritis)
*   **Definition:** Arthritis that develops following an infection elsewhere in the body (usually GI or Genitourinary).
*   **Causative Organisms:** *Chlamydia*, *Shigella*, *Salmonella*, *Yersinia*, *Campylobacter*.
*   **Clinical Triad:**
    1.  **Urethritis** (Can't pee)
    2.  **Conjunctivitis** (Can't see)
    3.  **Arthritis** (Can't climb a tree)
*   **Joints:** Acute, asymmetrical, oligoarthritis, predominantly affecting lower limb weight-bearing joints (Knees, Ankles).
*   **Skin Lesions:**
    *   **[[Keratoderma Blennorrhagica]]:** Pustular/hyperkeratotic lesions on palms and soles.
    *   **[[Circinate Balanitis]]:** Painless ulceration on the glans penis.
*   **Enthesitis:** Inflammation of the Achilles tendon insertion or plantar fascia ([[Plantar Fasciitis]]).

#### 2. Psoriatic Arthritis
*   **Association:** Occurs in 5-7% of patients with [[Psoriasis]].
*   **Pattern:**
    *   Asymmetrical oligoarthritis.
    *   Symmetrical polyarthritis (mimics Rheumatoid Arthritis).
    *   **DIP Joint Predominance:** Involvement of Distal Interphalangeal joints is characteristic.
    *   **[[Arthritis Mutilans]]:** Severe destructive form leading to "telescoping" of digits (Opera-glass hand).
*   **Clinical Signs:**
    *   **Sausage Digits ([[Dactylitis]]):** Diffuse swelling of an entire finger or toe.
    *   **Nail Changes:** Pitting, onycholysis.
*   **X-ray:** **"Pencil-in-cup"** deformity (erosion of the proximal phalanx head sharpening it like a pencil, with expansion of the distal phalanx base like a cup).

#### 3. Enteropathic Arthritis
*   **Association:** Occurs in [[Ulcerative Colitis]] and [[Crohn's Disease]].
*   **Types:**
    *   **Peripheral Arthritis:** Activity correlates with the flare-ups of the bowel disease.
    *   **Spondylitis (Axial):** Course is independent of the bowel disease activity.

### Comparison of Seronegative Spondyloarthropathies

| Feature | [[Ankylosing Spondylitis]] | [[Reiter's Disease]] | [[Psoriatic Arthritis]] | [[Enteropathic Arthritis]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gender** | Male > Female | Male > Female | Male = Female | Male = Female |
| **Onset** | Insidious | Sudden (post-infection) | Variable | Variable |
| **Distribution** | Axial > Peripheral | Peripheral (Lower Limb) | Peripheral (DIPs) + Axial | Peripheral + Axial |
| **Symmetry** | Symmetrical (Axial) | Asymmetrical | Asymmetrical/Symmetrical | Symmetrical |
| **HLA-B27** | > 90% | ~ 80% | ~ 50% | ~ 50% |
| **Extra-articular** | Uveitis, Cardiac | Urethritis, Conjunctivitis | Skin rash, Nail pitting | IBD, Uveitis |
| **Key Radiology** | Bamboo Spine | Calcaneal Spurs | Pencil-in-cup | Similar to AS |

### Clinical Implications
*   **Early Diagnosis:** A young male with chronic back pain and morning stiffness should be screened for AS to prevent deformity.
*   **Family History:** Genetic counseling may be relevant due to the strong [[HLA-B27]] association.
*   **Ophthalmology Referral:** Prompt referral for a red, painful eye is essential to prevent vision loss from [[Uveitis]].
*   **Lifestyle:** Smoking cessation is critical as it worsens spinal fusion and lung function in AS.
