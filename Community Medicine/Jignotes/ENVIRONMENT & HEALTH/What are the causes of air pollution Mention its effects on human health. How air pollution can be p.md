# [[ENVIRONMENT & HEALTH]] > What are the causes of air pollution? Mention its effects on human health. How air pollution can be prevented and controlled?

### **Causes of Air Pollution**

Air pollution signifies the presence of substances in the ambient atmosphere generated by human activities in concentrations that interfere with human health, safety, or comfort. The sources are broadly classified into the following categories:

1.  **Automobiles**
    *   They are the major source of air pollution in urban areas.
    *   They emit **hydrocarbons**, [[carbon monoxide]], lead, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter.
    *   Strong sunlight can convert hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides into **photochemical pollutants** (oxidizing nature).
    *   Diesel engines emit black smoke and malodorous fumes.

2.  **Industries**
    *   Combustion of fuel to generate heat and power produces smoke, [[sulphur dioxide]], nitrogen oxides, and **fly ash**,.
    *   Petrochemical industries generate hydrogen fluoride, hydrochloric acid, and organic halides.
    *   Discharge from high chimneys at high temperatures adds to atmospheric burden.

3.  **Domestic Sources**
    *   Domestic combustion of coal, wood, or oil is a major source of smoke, dust, sulphur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides.
    *   **Historical Note:** The London Air Pollution disaster (1952) was largely due to domestic coal burning.

4.  **Tobacco Smoke**
    *   It is the most direct and important source affecting many people.
    *   Even non-smokers inhale smoke produced by others (**Passive Smoking**).

5.  **Miscellaneous Sources**
    *   Burning refuse and incinerators.
    *   Pesticide spraying.
    *   Natural sources: Wind-borne dust, fungi, molds, bacteria.
    *   Nuclear energy programs.

### **Effects on Human Health**

The health effects are divided into immediate and delayed effects. The elderly, children, smokers, and those with respiratory difficulties are most vulnerable.

**1. Immediate Effects**
*   **Respiratory System:** Acute bronchitis and irritation of the respiratory tract.
*   **Mortality:** Intense pollution can result in immediate death by suffocation (e.g., London Epidemic 1952),.
*   **Morbidity:** Sudden increase in morbidity is often observed with a rise in pollution levels.

**2. Delayed Effects**
*   **Chronic Respiratory Diseases:** [[Chronic bronchitis]], [[bronchial asthma]], emphysema, and respiratory allergies.
*   **Malignancy:** [[Lung cancer]],.
*   **Children:** Impaired neuropsychological development due to lead exposure.

**3. Specific Effects of Major Pollutants**

| Pollutant | Adverse Health Effects |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Sulphur Dioxide (SO2)** | Bronchospasm, mucus production, exacerbation of asthma/COPD, eye irritation,. |
| **Carbon Monoxide (CO)** | Asphyxia (Hb affinity is 240x oxygen), reduces O2 carrying capacity. |
| **Lead** | Neuropsychological impairment in children (loss of IQ), hypertension, kidney damage. |
| **Ozone** | Cough, substernal discomfort, bronchoconstriction, decreased exercise performance. |
| **Particulate Matter** | When < 2.5 microns, they penetrate deep into lungs causing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. |

**Clinical Relevance:**
*   **CO Poisoning:** Often presents with headache, nausea, and in severe cases, "cherry-red" skin discoloration.
*   **Asthma Exacerbations:** Emergency room visits for asthma spike during periods of high air pollution (smog).

### **Prevention and Control of Air Pollution**

The WHO has recommended specific procedures for the prevention and control of air pollution.

**Mnemonic:** **C R D L I** (**C**lean **R**oads **D**ecrease **L**ung **I**nfections)

1.  **C - Containment**
    *   Prevention of escape of toxic substances into the ambient air.
    *   Achieved by engineering methods like **enclosure**, **ventilation**, and **air cleaning**.
    *   Development of **"arrestors"** and electrostatic precipitators for removal of contaminants,.

2.  **R - Replacement**
    *   Replacing a technological process causing pollution with a cleaner one.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Use of electricity, natural gas, or solar power instead of coal.
        *   Use of **unleaded petrol** (deleaded petrol) to reduce lead pollution.
        *   Replacement of coal engines with diesel/electric engines in railways.

3.  **D - Dilution**
    *   Valid only within the self-cleaning capacity of the environment.
    *   Establishment of **"Green Belts"** (vegetation) between industrial and residential areas.
    *   Vegetation removes some pollutants and acts as a buffer.

4.  **L - Legislation**
    *   Enforcement of laws like **Clean Air Acts** or The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act (1981 in India),.
    *   Measures include:
        *   Regulating height of chimneys.
        *   Creation of **smokeless zones**.
        *   Enforcement of ambient air quality standards.

5.  **I - International Action**
    *   WHO has established an international network of laboratories for monitoring air pollution.
    *   Centres in London, Washington, Moscow, Nagpur, and Tokyo issue warnings where necessary.

**Disinfection of Air**
In specific settings (like hospitals), air disinfection is used:
*   **Mechanical Ventilation:** Reduces bacterial density.
*   **Ultraviolet Radiation:** Effective in operation theatres and infectious disease wards.
*   **Chemical Mists:** Triethylene glycol vapours are effective against droplet nuclei.
*   **Dust Control:** Oil application to floors reduces bacterial content.
