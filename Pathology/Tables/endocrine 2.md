| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Diabetes type 1 (T1D)** An autoimmune disease characterized by pancreatic β-cell destruction and an absolute deficiency of insulin. | Autoimmune disease where immune effector cells (T-cells) react against and destroy endogenous β-cell antigens. | * **Genetic susceptibility:** Strong linkage to the HLA gene cluster. * **Environmental factors:** Postulated to be viral infections which may trigger autoimmunity via **molecular mimicry**. | **Pathogenesis:** A failure of self-tolerance in T-cells specific for islet antigens, due to defective clonal deletion or defective regulatory T-cell function. Autoreactive T-cells survive and are activated, trafficking to the pancreas to cause β-cell injury.   * **Effector cells:** CD4+ Th1 cells secrete cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF) that injure β-cells. CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) directly kill β-cells. * **Autoantigens:** Insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), and others.  **Stages:**   * **Stage 1:** Autoimmunity positive, normoglycemia, presymptomatic. * **Stage 2:** Autoimmunity positive, dysglycemia, presymptomatic (progressive β-cell loss). * **Stage 3:** Symptomatic disease with classic manifestations (after >90% of β-cells are destroyed). | * **HLA gene cluster (chromosome 6p21):** Strongest association. 90-95% of patients have **HLA-DR3** or **HLA-DR4** haplotypes. Highest risk is with **DR3/DR4** compound heterozygotes. * **Non-HLA genes:** Polymorphisms in genes encoding regulators of T-cell responses, such as **CTLA4** and **PTPN22**. Polymorphisms (VNTRs) in the promoter region of the **insulin (INS) gene**. * **AIRE gene mutations:** Cause Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndrome type 1 (APS-1), which includes T1D. | Pancreatic alterations are subtle and inconstant. | * Reduction in the number and size of islets of Langerhans. * **Insulitis:** A leukocytic infiltrate composed principally of T lymphocytes within the islets. * Marked β-cell depletion and islet atrophy. | * Onset is usually in childhood and adolescence. * Patients are typically of normal weight or have lost weight. * **Classic Triad: Polyuria** (osmotic diuresis), **Polydipsia** (thirst), and **Polyphagia** (hunger). * Weight loss and muscle weakness despite increased appetite. | * Progressive decrease in insulin levels (and C-peptide). * Circulating islet autoantibodies (anti-insulin, anti-GAD, anti-ICA512). * Hyperglycemia: fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL or random ≥200 mg/dL. * Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level ≥6.5%. | * **Immune-mediated:** Most common form, with evidence of autoimmunity. * **Idiopathic:** Rare, autoantibody-negative. | * **Acute:** Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hypoglycemia (iatrogenic). * **Chronic:** Diabetic macrovascular disease (atherosclerosis, MI, stroke) and microvascular disease (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy). | Requires lifelong insulin for survival. Pancreatic islet cell transplantation is a therapeutic option for some patients. |
| **Diabetes type 2 (T2D)** A complex metabolic disorder caused by a combination of peripheral resistance to insulin action and an inadequate compensatory secretory response by pancreatic β-cells ("relative insulin deficiency"). | A complex disease involving the interplay of genetic and environmental factors and a pro-inflammatory state. It has no autoimmune basis. | * **Obesity:** The most important risk factor, particularly central or visceral obesity (>80% of patients are obese). * **Sedentary lifestyle**. * **Genetic Susceptibility:** First-degree relatives have a 5- to 10-fold higher risk. * **Sleep disorders** and **circadian disruption**. | **1. Insulin Resistance:** Failure of target tissues (liver, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue) to respond normally to insulin. This leads to:  * Failure to inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis (high fasting glucose). * Failure of glucose uptake by muscle after a meal (high postprandial glucose). * Failure to inhibit lipase in adipose tissue (high free fatty acids).  **2. β-Cell Dysfunction:** Initially, β-cells compensate for insulin resistance by hypersecretion of insulin (hyperinsulinemia). Over time, β-cells become exhausted, leading to a state of relative insulin deficiency. This is exacerbated by:  * **Lipotoxicity:** Excess free fatty acids (FFAs) compromise β-cell function. * **Glucotoxicity:** Chronic hyperglycemia impairs β-cell function. * Abnormal **incretin effect**. * Amyloid deposition in islets. | Polygenic disease. At least 30 loci have been identified by GWAS, individually conferring minimal to modest risk. Many genes are involved in:  * Adipose tissue function (e.g., bodily fat distribution). * Islet β-cell function. * Obesity (e.g., **TCF7L2, PPARG, FTO**). * "Clock" genes involved in circadian rhythm. | Pancreatic alterations are subtle and inconstant. | * No insulitis. * A subtle reduction in islet cell mass. * **Amyloid deposition** within islets is a characteristic finding in long-standing T2D (>90% of cases), beginning in and around capillaries and between cells. It can be stained with Congo red. | * Typically adult-onset, but increasing in children/adolescents. * Vast majority of patients are obese (80%). * Often diagnosed on routine blood testing in asymptomatic individuals. * Symptoms, if present, can be nonspecific: fatigue, dizziness, blurred vision. | * Increased blood insulin (early); normal or moderately decreased insulin (late). * No islet autoantibodies. * Hyperglycemia: fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL or random ≥200 mg/dL. * Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level ≥6.5%. | - | * **Acute:** Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), hypoglycemia (iatrogenic). DKA is rare. * **Chronic:** Same as T1D; macrovascular and microvascular disease. * Often associated with the **metabolic syndrome** (obesity, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, hypertension). | Lifestyle modification (diet, exercise, weight loss). Oral antidiabetic agents. Incretin-based therapies (GLP-1 agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors). Insulin therapy is often required in later stages. |
| **Diabetes in pregnancy (Gestational Diabetes)** Impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes that develops for the first time during pregnancy. | Occurs when a previously euglycemic woman cannot overcome the insulin resistance favored by the hormonal milieu of pregnancy. | Concurrent genetic and environmental factors that predispose to T2D. | Pregnancy is a "diabetogenic" state where the prevailing hormonal milieu favors insulin resistance. In a susceptible woman, the pancreatic β-cells cannot produce enough insulin to maintain euglycemia, leading to gestational diabetes. | Same genetic susceptibilities as T2D. | - | An increase in the number and size of fetal islets is characteristic of newborns of mothers with diabetes (gestational or pregestational). This is a hyperplastic response to maternal hyperglycemia. | Hyperglycemia during pregnancy. Typically resolves after delivery. | Hyperglycemia detected during pregnancy screening tests (e.g., oral glucose tolerance test). | - | * **Maternal:** Increased risk of developing overt T2D over the next 10 to 20 years. * **Fetal:** Increased risk of stillbirth and congenital malformations (in pregestational diabetes). Excessive birth weight (**macrosomia**) in poorly controlled gestational diabetes. * **Child:** Long-term sequelae including increased risk of obesity and diabetes later in life. | - |
| **Insulinoma (Hyperinsulinism)** β-cell tumors that are the most common pancreatic endocrine neoplasms and produce sufficient insulin to induce clinically significant hypoglycemia. | Benign neoplastic proliferation of pancreatic β-cells. Can also be caused by focal or diffuse islet cell hyperplasia, especially in neonates. | Associated with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia, type 1 (MEN-1). | Autonomous overproduction of insulin by a tumor or hyperplastic islets, leading to hypoglycemia. The tumor does not respond to normal physiologic feedback mechanisms. | In sporadic PanNETs, mutations in **MEN1, PTEN, TSC2, ATRX, DAXX** can be involved. | Usually solitary, small (<2 cm), encapsulated, pale to red-brown nodules located anywhere in the pancreas. | Benign tumors resemble giant islets, with regular cords of monotonous cells. Malignancy is rare (10%) and defined by invasion/metastasis. Deposition of **amyloid** is a characteristic feature. Electron microscopy reveals distinctive membrane-bound granules of β-cells. | Episodes of hypoglycemia (blood glucose <50 mg/dL) precipitated by fasting or exercise. Manifestations include confusion, stupor, and loss of consciousness. Symptoms are promptly relieved by feeding or parenteral glucose. | * High circulating levels of insulin. * **High insulin-to-glucose ratio.** | - | If malignant, can have local invasion and distant metastases. Can be associated with MEN-1 syndrome. | Surgical removal of the tumor, which is usually curative for benign adenomas. |
| **Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome (Gastrinoma)** A syndrome caused by gastrin-producing tumors (gastrinomas) that lead to marked hypersecretion of gastric acid and severe peptic ulceration. | Neoplastic proliferation of gastrin-producing endocrine cells. Tumors are just as likely to arise in the duodenum and peripancreatic soft tissues (**gastrinoma triangle**) as in the pancreas. | Associated with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia, type 1 (MEN-1) in about 25% of patients. | Tumor cells autonomously secrete large amounts of gastrin. This hypergastrinemia stimulates parietal cells in the stomach to produce excessive amounts of gastric acid, leading to the formation of peptic ulcers. | Associated with germline loss-of-function mutations in the **MEN1** gene. | More than half are locally invasive or have metastasized at diagnosis. Tumors can be solitary (sporadic) or multifocal (MEN-1-associated). | Histologically bland and rarely show marked anaplasia. The cells are monotonous and well-differentiated. | Presents with peptic ulcers, often multiple and in unusual locations (e.g., jejunum). The ulcers are often intractable and unresponsive to therapy. May present with diarrhea. | Elevated serum gastrin levels. | - | Peptic ulcer disease (90-95% of patients). Progressive tumor growth can lead to liver failure from metastases. | Control of gastric acid with proton pump inhibitors (H+K+-ATPase inhibitors). Surgical excision of the neoplasm when possible. |
| **Hypercortisolism (Cushing Syndrome)** A disorder caused by conditions that produce elevated glucocorticoid (cortisol) levels. | Can be exogenous (iatrogenic) or endogenous. Endogenous causes can be ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent. | - | Elevated cortisol levels exert widespread metabolic effects.  * **ACTH-dependent:** An ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma (Cushing disease) or ectopic ACTH from a non-pituitary tumor stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce excess cortisol. * **ACTH-independent:** A primary adrenal neoplasm (adenoma or carcinoma) or adrenal hyperplasia autonomously secretes cortisol, suppressing pituitary ACTH. | * **Cushing Disease:** Pituitary corticotroph adenomas can have activating mutations in **USP8** or **GNAS**. * **Adrenal Carcinoma:** Recurrent activating mutations of **CTNNB1** (β-catenin) and inactivating mutations of **TP53, MEN1, PRKAR1A**. * **Primary adrenal hyperplasia:** Can be associated with germline mutations in **ARMC5**, **GNAS** (McCune-Albright syndrome), or **PRKAR1A** (Carney complex). | Adrenal morphology varies by cause:  * **Cortical Atrophy:** Bilateral, seen in exogenous steroid use. * **Diffuse Hyperplasia:** Bilateral enlargement, yellow, thickened cortex (ACTH-dependent). * **Nodular Hyperplasia:** Macronodular or micronodular replacement of adrenals. * **Neoplasm:** Solitary adrenal adenoma (yellow, encapsulated) or carcinoma (large, unencapsulated, variegated). | * **Pituitary: Crooke hyaline change** in non-adenomatous ACTH-producing cells, due to accumulation of intermediate keratin filaments. * **Adrenal Adenoma:** Composed of cells similar to normal zona fasciculata. * **Adrenal Carcinoma:** Anaplastic features. | * **Central (truncal) obesity**, **moon facies**, **buffalo hump**. * Thin, fragile, easily bruised skin; poor wound healing; purple abdominal **striae**. * Hypertension, glucose intolerance/secondary diabetes. * Muscle weakness (proximal myopathy), osteoporosis. * Mental disturbances (depression, psychosis), hirsutism, menstrual irregularity. | * Increased 24-hour urine free-cortisol concentration. * Loss of normal diurnal pattern of cortisol secretion. * **Dexamethasone suppression test** and serum **ACTH levels** are used to determine the cause. | **Endogenous Causes:**  * **ACTH-Dependent (70-80%):** Cushing disease (60-70%), Ectopic ACTH (5-10%). * **ACTH-Independent (20-30%):** Adrenal adenoma (10-22%), Adrenal carcinoma (5-7%), Primary adrenal hyperplasia (<2%). | Hypertension, secondary diabetes, osteoporosis, increased risk of infections. When caused by pituitary adenoma, it is called Cushing disease. Can be part of Carney complex or McCune-Albright syndrome. | Treatment depends on the cause: surgery for tumors (pituitary, adrenal, ectopic), radiation therapy, or medications to inhibit steroidogenesis. |
| **Primary Hyperaldosteronism** A group of conditions characterized by chronic, autonomous overproduction of aldosterone, leading to hypertension and suppression of the renin-angiotensin system. | Primary hyperaldosteronism is caused by an intrinsic adrenal disorder. This is in contrast to secondary hyperaldosteronism, where excess aldosterone is a response to renin-angiotensin activation (e.g., from renal artery stenosis). | - | Autonomous aldosterone secretion from an adenoma or hyperplastic adrenal glands causes increased renal sodium and water reabsorption, leading to expansion of extracellular fluid volume and hypertension. The increased volume suppresses renin secretion. Aldosterone also promotes renal potassium excretion, which can lead to hypokalemia. | * **Aldosterone-producing adenoma (Conn syndrome):** Up to 50% have somatic mutations in **KCNJ5** (GIRK4 potassium channel), leading to loss of ion selectivity and chronic cell depolarization. Other mutations include **CACNA1H** and **ATP1A1**. * **Familial Hyperaldosteronism (FH):** - **FH-I:** A chimeric gene fusion between **CYP11B1** and **CYP11B2**, making aldosterone synthesis ACTH-responsive. - **FH-III:** Germline **KCNJ5** mutations. | * **Adenomas (Conn syndrome):** Almost always solitary, small (<2 cm), well-circumscribed, bright yellow nodules. * **Idiopathic Hyperplasia:** Bilateral diffuse and focal hyperplasia of glomerulosa cells, often wedge-shaped. | * **Adenomas:** Composed of lipid-laden cortical cells resembling fasciculata cells more than glomerulosa cells. Eosinophilic, laminated cytoplasmic inclusions called **spironolactone bodies** are a characteristic feature after treatment with spironolactone. * Adjacent cortex is NOT atrophic. | The most common cause of secondary hypertension. Main manifestation is **hypertension**. If hypokalemia is present, it can cause neuromuscular symptoms (weakness, paresthesias, visual disturbances, tetany). | * **Screening Test:** Elevated plasma aldosterone concentration to plasma renin activity ratio. * **Confirmatory Test:** Aldosterone suppression test. * Serum electrolytes may show hypokalemia. | * **Bilateral idiopathic hyperaldosteronism:** (60% of cases) * **Adrenocortical neoplasm (Conn syndrome):** (35% of cases), usually an adenoma. * **Familial hyperaldosteronism:** (5% of cases). | Cardiovascular compromise (left ventricular hypertrophy), stroke, myocardial infarction. Hypokalemia. | * **Adenoma:** Surgical excision. * **Bilateral hyperplasia:** Medical management with an aldosterone antagonist such as spironolactone. |
| **Adrenogenital Syndromes (Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia - CAH)** A group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by a deficiency of a particular enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of cortisol, leading to virilization and other hormonal imbalances. | Inherited metabolic errors in steroid biosynthesis. The most common cause is **21-hydroxylase deficiency** (over 90% of cases), caused by mutations in the CYP21A2 gene. | Family history (autosomal recessive inheritance). | An enzyme defect (e.g., 21-hydroxylase deficiency) impairs cortisol synthesis. The low cortisol level leads to a loss of negative feedback on the pituitary, causing increased secretion of **ACTH**. The high ACTH levels cause adrenal hyperplasia and drive the steroid pathway towards androgen production, as the block prevents cortisol/aldosterone synthesis. Depending on the specific enzyme defect and its severity, aldosterone synthesis may also be impaired, leading to salt wasting. | **21-hydroxylase deficiency:** Caused by mutations in the **CYP21A2** gene. Severity varies depending on the specific mutation. | Bilaterally hyperplastic adrenals, which may be 10-15 times their normal weight. On cut section, the cortex is thickened, nodular, and brown due to lipid depletion. | The hyperplastic cortex consists of proliferating compact, eosinophilic, lipid-depleted cells mixed with lipid-laden clear cells. The anterior pituitary shows hyperplasia of corticotroph (ACTH-producing) cells. | Clinical features depend on the specific enzyme defect and its severity.  * **Females:** Ambiguous genitalia at birth (clitoral hypertrophy, pseudohermaphroditism), oligomenorrhea, hirsutism, acne. * **Males:** Enlargement of external genitalia, precocious puberty, oligospermia. * **Salt-wasting:** In severe forms, presents in neonates with vomiting, dehydration, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypotension, and circulatory collapse. | Diagnosis is made by routine neonatal metabolic screening or by demonstrating biosynthetic defects in steroidogenesis (e.g., elevated levels of steroid precursors like 17-hydroxyprogesterone). | Based on clinical presentation of 21-hydroxylase deficiency:  * **Salt-wasting ("classic") adrenogenitalism:** Most severe form, with virilization and salt loss. * **Simple virilizing adrenogenitalism:** Virilization without salt wasting. * **"Nonclassic" or late-onset adrenogenitalism:** Mildest form with later onset. | In severe forms, it is a life-threatening condition in infancy. Long-term issues with virilization and fertility. Associated with adrenomedullary dysplasia in severe forms. | Treatment with exogenous glucocorticoids to replace cortisol and suppress ACTH secretion. Mineralocorticoid supplementation is required in salt-wasting variants. |
| **Primary Acute Adrenocortical Insufficiency (Adrenal Crisis)** A rapid and severe deficiency of adrenal cortical hormones, often presenting as a medical emergency. | Can occur in several settings:  * Precipitation by stress (e.g., infection, surgery) in a patient with chronic adrenocortical insufficiency (Addison disease). * Rapid withdrawal of corticosteroids in a patient on long-term therapy. * Massive adrenal hemorrhage (e.g., Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome). | Underlying chronic adrenal insufficiency; long-term steroid use; severe sepsis; anticoagulant therapy; major trauma or surgery. | A sudden loss of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid function leads to an inability to maintain blood pressure, conserve sodium and water, and mount an adequate stress response. In patients on steroids, the atrophic adrenals cannot produce cortisol in response to stress. Massive hemorrhage physically destroys the adrenal cortex. | - | In hemorrhagic cases, the adrenals are converted to sacs of clotted blood (see Waterhouse-Friderichsen). | - | Presents as an acute crisis with intractable vomiting, abdominal pain, hypotension, coma, and vascular collapse. Death occurs rapidly without treatment. | - | - | Hypovolemic shock, coma, death. | Immediate administration of intravenous corticosteroids and supportive care. |
| **Waterhouse-Friderichsen Syndrome** A catastrophic syndrome characterized by overwhelming bacterial infection, hypotension, shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and massive bilateral adrenal hemorrhage, leading to acute adrenocortical insufficiency. | Classically caused by overwhelming septicemia with ***Neisseria meningitidis***. Can also be caused by other virulent bacteria like *Pseudomonas*, pneumococci, or *H. influenzae*. | More common in children. Asplenia is a risk factor. | The pathogenesis of the adrenal hemorrhage is uncertain but may be due to direct bacterial seeding of adrenal small vessels, DIC, or endothelial dysfunction caused by microbial products and inflammatory mediators. The hemorrhage starts in the medulla and suffuses into the cortex, destroying the gland and causing acute adrenal failure. | - | The adrenals are grossly hemorrhagic and shrunken, converted to sacs of clotted blood which obscures all underlying detail. | Microscopically, little residual cortical architecture is discernible. Hemorrhage starts near thin-walled venous sinusoids in the medulla and extends into the cortex. | Rapidly progressive hypotension leading to shock. Widespread purpuric rash, particularly of the skin. Signs of acute adrenal crisis develop rapidly. | - | - | Septic shock, DIC, acute adrenal insufficiency, death. | A medical emergency requiring immediate administration of antibiotics, corticosteroids, and aggressive supportive care. |
| **Primary Chronic Adrenocortical Insufficiency (Addison Disease)** An uncommon disorder resulting from the progressive destruction of the adrenal cortex. Clinical signs appear after at least 90% of the cortex is destroyed. | Over 90% of cases are due to:  * **Autoimmune adrenalitis** (most common cause in high-income countries) * **Tuberculosis** * **AIDS** * **Metastatic cancers** | Associated with other autoimmune diseases (e.g., Hashimoto's, T1D), especially in Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndromes (APS). | Progressive destruction of adrenocortical cells (e.g., by autoimmunity or infection) leads to a deficiency of both glucocorticoids (cortisol) and mineralocorticoids (aldosterone). Lack of cortisol leads to increased POMC and ACTH from the pituitary, causing hyperpigmentation. Lack of aldosterone causes potassium retention and sodium/water loss, leading to hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and hypotension. | **Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndrome type 1 (APS-1)** is caused by mutations in the **AIRE** gene, which is critical for central T-cell tolerance. This leads to autoimmunity against multiple endocrine organs, including the adrenal. | Gland appearance depends on cause:  * **Autoimmune:** Irregularly shrunken glands. * **Tuberculous/Fungal:** Architecture is effaced by granulomatous inflammation. * **Metastatic:** Adrenals are enlarged and infiltrated by tumor. | * **Autoimmune adrenalitis:** Cortex shows scattered residual cortical cells in a collapsed connective tissue network with a variable lymphoid infiltrate. Medulla is spared. | * Insidious onset with progressive weakness and easy fatigability. * Gastrointestinal disturbances: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, diarrhea. * **Hyperpigmentation** of the skin (sun-exposed areas, pressure points) and mucous membranes. * Hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia. | * Elevated serum ACTH levels. * Low cortisol and aldosterone levels. * Lack of response to ACTH stimulation test. * Autoantibodies to steroidogenic enzymes (e.g., 21-hydroxylase) in autoimmune cases. | - | Can precipitate into an acute adrenal crisis under stress. Can be part of Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndromes (APS-1, APS-2, APS-4). | Lifelong hormone replacement therapy with both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. |
| **Secondary Adrenocortical Insufficiency** Adrenocortical insufficiency due to a deficiency of pituitary ACTH secretion. | Caused by any disorder of the hypothalamus or pituitary that reduces ACTH output, such as tumors, infection, infarction, or irradiation. Prolonged administration of exogenous glucocorticoids is an analogous cause, as it suppresses endogenous ACTH. | History of pituitary disease or long-term high-dose steroid therapy. | Lack of ACTH stimulation leads to atrophy of the zona fasciculata and reticularis of the adrenal cortex, causing decreased production of cortisol and adrenal androgens. The zona glomerulosa is largely unaffected because it is primarily regulated by the renin-angiotensin system, not ACTH. Therefore, aldosterone synthesis remains normal or near-normal. | - | The adrenal glands are moderately to markedly decreased in size. They are small and flattened but retain their yellow color. | The cortex is reduced to a thin ribbon composed largely of zona glomerulosa, with atrophy of the zona fasciculata and reticularis. The medulla is not affected. | Symptoms are similar to Addison disease (weakness, fatigue, GI upset) but there is **NO hyperpigmentation** because ACTH and POMC levels are low. There are also no signs of mineralocorticoid deficiency (no marked hyperkalemia or volume depletion). | Low levels of plasma ACTH. Low levels of cortisol. A prompt rise in plasma cortisol levels after administration of exogenous ACTH. | - | Often occurs as part of panhypopituitarism, with deficiencies of other pituitary hormones. | Glucocorticoid replacement therapy. |
| **Pheochromocytoma** A neoplasm composed of chromaffin cells from the adrenal medulla, which synthesizes and releases catecholamines. | Tumor of adrenal medullary chromaffin cells. ~25% of cases are associated with a familial syndrome. Tumors arising in extra-adrenal paraganglia are called paragangliomas. | Family history of pheochromocytoma or associated syndromes (MEN-2, VHL, NF1). | The tumor autonomously produces and secretes large amounts of catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine). These hormones cause episodic or sustained hypertension and other systemic effects. Genetic pathways often involve either enhanced growth factor signaling or creation of a **"pseudohypoxia"** state by stabilizing hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). | Associated with germline mutations in multiple genes:  * **RET:** Gain-of-function (in MEN-2A, MEN-2B). * **NF1:** Loss-of-function. * **VHL:** Loss-of-function (von Hippel-Lindau syndrome). * **SDHB, SDHC, SDHD:** Loss-of-function mutations in succinate dehydrogenase complex components. * **EPAS1:** Gain-of-function mutation stabilizing HIF-2α. | Range from small circumscribed lesions to large, hemorrhagic masses. On cut section, they are yellow-tan. Fresh tissue turns dark brown when incubated with potassium dichromate (**chromaffin** reaction). | Composed of polygonal to spindle-shaped chromaffin cells arranged in small nests or alveoli (**zellballen**), surrounded by a rich vascular network. Cytoplasm is finely granular. Nuclei have stippled "salt-and-pepper" chromatin. Definitive diagnosis of malignancy is based exclusively on the presence of metastases. | Dominant clinical manifestation is **hypertension** (in 90%), which may be sustained or paroxysmal. Paroxysms include abrupt elevation in blood pressure with tachycardia, palpitations, headache, sweating, and tremor. Can precipitate MI, CVA, or congestive heart failure. | Increased urinary excretion of free catecholamines and their metabolites (e.g., vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and metanephrines). | **The "Rule of 10s" (now outdated):** 10% are extra-adrenal, 10% are bilateral (up to 50% in familial cases), 10% are malignant (higher in paragangliomas), 10% are not associated with hypertension. | Catecholamine cardiomyopathy. Associated with MEN-2A, MEN-2B, von Hippel-Lindau disease, and Neurofibromatosis type 1. | Surgical excision after medical preparation with adrenergic-blocking agents to control blood pressure and prevent hypertensive crisis. |
| **Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1; Wermer syndrome)** A rare autosomal dominant inherited disease resulting in proliferative lesions (hyperplasia, adenomas, carcinomas) of the parathyroid, pancreas, and pituitary (the "3 P's"). | Autosomal dominant inherited disorder caused by germline inactivating mutations of the MEN1 tumor suppressor gene. | Family history. | Inheritance of one mutated MEN1 allele predisposes the individual to developing tumors. A second, somatic "hit" that inactivates the remaining wild-type allele leads to tumor development in susceptible endocrine organs. Menin, the protein product of MEN1, is a transcription factor component that can either promote or inhibit tumorigenesis depending on its binding partners. | Germline inactivating mutations of the **MEN1** tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 11q13. The encoded protein is **menin**. | Tumors in multiple endocrine organs. They tend to be multifocal within an organ. | Characterized by hyperplasia or adenomas in the affected glands. Tumors are often preceded by an asymptomatic stage of hyperplasia. | Manifestations depend on the affected organs and the hormones produced.  * **Parathyroid (most common):** Signs of primary hyperparathyroidism. * **Pancreas:** Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinomas), hypoglycemia (insulinomas). * **Pituitary (most frequent):** Prolactinoma causing amenorrhea/galactorrhea, or acromegaly. | Elevated hormone levels corresponding to the tumors present (e.g., PTH, gastrin, prolactin). Genetic testing for MEN1 mutation. | - | Associated tumors: Parathyroid hyperplasia/adenoma, Pancreatic endocrine tumors (gastrinoma, insulinoma), Pituitary adenoma (prolactinoma), Duodenal gastrinomas, Carcinoid tumors, Thyroid/adrenal adenomas, Lipomas. | Management of the specific endocrine tumors and their hormonal effects. |
| **Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN-2; Sipple syndrome)** An autosomal dominant inherited disease characterized by pheochromocytoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, and parathyroid hyperplasia (in MEN-2A) or mucosal neuromas (in MEN-2B). | Autosomal dominant inherited disorder caused by germline gain-of-function mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. | Family history. | A germline gain-of-function mutation in the RET proto-oncogene leads to constitutive activation of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase, even in the absence of its ligand. This drives uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation in susceptible cell types (thyroid C-cells, adrenal chromaffin cells, parathyroid cells). | Germline gain-of-function mutations in the **RET proto-oncogene** on chromosome 10q11.2. Different mutations cause MEN-2A versus MEN-2B. | Pheochromocytomas are often bilateral. Medullary thyroid carcinomas are multifocal. | Medullary thyroid carcinomas are virtually always associated with foci of **C-cell hyperplasia** in the adjacent thyroid, a precursor lesion. | Clinical presentation depends on subtype:  * **MEN-2A:** Medullary thyroid carcinoma (100%), pheochromocytoma (40-50%), primary hyperparathyroidism (10-20%). * **MEN-2B:** Medullary thyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma (as in 2A), but no hyperparathyroidism. Instead, associated with neuromas/ganglioneuromas of skin/mucosa and a **marfanoid habitus**. | Elevated calcitonin levels (from medullary carcinoma). Elevated catecholamines (from pheochromocytoma). Genetic testing for RET mutation is crucial. | * **MEN-2A (Sipple syndrome)** * **MEN-2B** * **Familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (now grouped with MEN-2B)** * **MEN-4** (new entity, phenocopies MEN-1 but has germline **CDKN1B** mutations) | Medullary thyroid carcinoma is life-threatening. Pheochromocytoma. Hyperparathyroidism. | Genetic screening of at-risk family members is critical. Individuals carrying a RET mutation are advised to undergo prophylactic thyroidectomy to prevent the inevitable development of medullary thyroid carcinoma. |
| **Pinealoma** A term for tumors arising from the pineocytes of the pineal gland. Most tumors involving the pineal gland, however, are germ cell tumors. | Neoplastic proliferation of pineocytes. However, 50-70% of tumors in the pineal region are of germ cell origin (germinomas, teratomas, etc.). | - | - | - | - | Pineal gland is composed of a loose neuroglial stroma with nests of pineocytes, which have photosensory and neuroendocrine functions and long, slender processes. | - | - | Based on differentiation:  * **Pineoblastomas** (less differentiated, more aggressive) * **Pineocytomas** (more differentiated, less aggressive) | - | - |
