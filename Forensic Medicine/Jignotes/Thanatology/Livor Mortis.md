# [[Thanatology]] > Livor Mortis

### Definition and Synonyms
**[[Livor Mortis]]** is the post-mortem discoloration of the body due to the settling of blood in the dependent parts under the influence of gravity.

*   **Synonyms:** 
    *   [[Postmortem Staining]] / Hypostasis
    *   Cadaveric Lividity
    *   Suggillation
    *   Vibices
    *   *Darkening of death*

### Pathophysiology
After [[Somatic Death]], circulation ceases. The blood, being a liquid suspension, sinks through the blood vessels to the lowest parts of the body due to gravity. 
*   The red blood cells settle into the capillaries and venules of the dependent areas.
*   The [[Hemoglobin]] dissociates and becomes reduced (deoxygenated), giving the skin a **bluish-purple** or purplish-red color.
*   **Contact Pallor (Contact Blanching):** Areas of the body that are in direct contact with a firm surface (e.g., shoulder blades, buttocks, calves in a supine body) remain pale because the pressure prevents the capillaries from filling with blood.

### Development and Chronology
The timing varies depending on the climate and condition of the body, but general timelines are:

| Stage | Time Since Death | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Onset** | 30 minutes – 2 hours | Begins as small patchy mottling. |
| **Coalescence** | 4 – 6 hours | Patches enlarge and fuse to form uniform staining. |
| **Maximum** | 6 – 12 hours | Fully developed. |
| **Fixation** | 6 – 12 hours | Does not blanch on pressure; cannot be shifted. |

**Fixation of Lividity:**
*   Initially, lividity disappears on pressing with a thumb (blanching).
*   **Fixation** occurs when the blood vessels become permeable due to decomposition/hemolysis, and hemoglobin stains the surrounding tissues. Once fixed, the color does not shift even if the body position is changed.

### Distribution Patterns
The pattern depends strictly on the position of the body after death:
1.  **Supine (Face up):** Staining on the back of the head, neck, trunk, and calves.
2.  **Prone (Face down):** Staining on the front of the face, chest, and abdomen.
    *   *Note:* Tardieu spots (petechiae) are common in prone positions due to intense congestion.
3.  **Suspension (Hanging):** **Glove and Stocking distribution**. Blood pools in the lower limbs, hands, and forearms. Also seen in the external genitalia.
4.  **Drowning (In flowing water):** Lividity may not develop if the body is constantly tumbling.

### Color Variations (Diagnostic Significance)
The color of hypostasis can indicate the [[Cause of Death]], particularly in poisoning cases.

| Color | Indication/Poison | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bluish-Purple** | Normal death | Reduced Hemoglobin |
| **Cherry Red** / Pinkish | [[Carbon Monoxide]] (CO) | Carboxyhemoglobin |
| **Bright Red** / Brick Red | [[Cyanide]] (HCN) | Cyanmethemoglobin (high oxygen saturation) |
| **Pink** | [[Hypothermia]] / Cold | Retention of Oxyhemoglobin |
| **Chocolate Brown** | [[Nitrites]], Aniline, Chlorates | [[Methemoglobinemia]] |
| **Dark Brown** / Yellow | [[Phosphorus]] | Jaundice/Liver damage |
| **Greenish-Blue** | [[Hydrogen Sulfide]] (H2S) | Sulfhemoglobin |
| **Black** | [[Opium]] | Extreme Deoxygenation |

> **Mnemonic for Colors: "Cyanide Bricks make Cherries Cool"**
> *   **Cyanide** = **Brick** red
> *   **Cherries** = **C**arbon monoxide (Cherry Red)
> *   **Cool** = **Cold** / Hypothermia (Pink)

### Medicolegal Importance
1.  **Sign of Death:** Confirms somatic death.
2.  **Estimation of [[Time Since Death]] (TSD):** Based on the onset and fixation of lividity.
3.  **Position of Body:** Helps determine if the body was moved after death.
    *   *Example:* If a body is found supine but lividity is present on the front (anterior), it implies the body was moved after lividity became fixed.
4.  **Cause of Death:** As indicated by specific color changes (e.g., CO poisoning).
5.  **Distribution of Lividity:** Can sometimes mimic bruises (e.g., in the neck muscles) or marks of violence.

### Differential Diagnosis: Hypostasis vs. Contusion (Bruise)
This is a favorite exam topic. You must differentiate between post-mortem staining and an ante-mortem [[Bruise]].

| Feature | Postmortem Lividity (Hypostasis) | Bruise (Contusion) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cause** | Gravity/Passive settling | Blunt force trauma |
| **Site** | Dependent parts only | Anywhere (site of impact) |
| **Surface** | Not elevated | Often elevated/swollen |
| **Margins** | Well defined (except contact pallor) | Ill-defined |
| **Incision Test** | Blood flows from cut vessels; **Washes away** | Blood extravasated in tissues; **Does not wash away** |
| **Effect of Pressure** | Blanches (before fixation) | Does not blanch |
| **Relation to Vessels** | Intravascular | Extravascular |
| **Histology** | No inflammation | Inflammation/Vital reaction present |

### Autopsy Findings
*   **External:** Document color, distribution, and fixation. Look for "Tardieu spots" (petechial hemorrhages) within the lividity in asphyxial deaths.
*   **Internal (Visceral Hypostasis):**
    *   Internal organs (Lungs, Liver, Kidneys, Heart) also show settling of blood in dependent areas.
    *   **Lungs:** Posterior parts become dark and heavy (Hypostatic congestion). This must not be confused with pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
    *   **Heart:** Blood settling in the posterior wall of the left ventricle may mimic myocardial infarction.
    *   **Intestine:** Dark discoloration in loops may mimic gangrene or inflammation.
