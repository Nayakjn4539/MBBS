# [[Principles Of Epidemiology And Epidemiologic Methods]] > Epidemic Curves

### **Epidemic Curve**

An **[[Epidemic curve]]** is a graphical representation of the distribution of cases of a disease (or health-related event) by the time of onset of illness. It serves as a fundamental tool in the investigation of an outbreak.

#### **Structure of the Graph**
*   **X-axis (Horizontal):** Represents **Time** (hours, days, weeks, months, or years depending on the incubation period).
*   **Y-axis (Vertical):** Represents the **Number of cases**.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> A histogram with 'Time' on the X-axis and 'Number of Cases' on the Y-axis. The shape of the bars determines the type of epidemic.

#### **Objectives and Utility**
An epidemic curve helps the epidemiologist to:
1.  **Define the magnitude** of the epidemic over time.
2.  **Identify the mode of transmission:** The shape of the curve reveals if it is a common source or propagated source.
3.  **Determine the source:** Time relationships with exposure can identify the potential source.
4.  **Estimate the [[Incubation Period]]:** Helps in identifying the median incubation period.
5.  **Forecast:** Predict the future course of the epidemic.

#### **Types of Epidemic Curves**

The shape of the curve is determined by the pattern of exposure and the nature of the disease.

**1. Common Source Epidemics**
These occur when a group of people is exposed to a common noxious influence (infectious agent or toxin).

*   **A. Single Exposure / Point Source Epidemic:**
    *   **Exposure:** Brief and essentially simultaneous.
    *   **Shape:** **Explosive**. The curve rises rapidly to a sharp peak and falls rapidly.
    *   **Key Feature:** All cases develop within **one incubation period** of the disease. There are **no secondary waves**.
    *   **Clustering:** Cases cluster within a narrow interval of time.
    *   **Examples:** Food poisoning, **[[Bhopal Gas Tragedy]]**, Minamata disease.
    *   **Median Incubation Period:** The time required for 50% of cases to occur following exposure.

*   **B. Continuous or Repeated Exposure:**
    *   **Exposure:** Prolonged, continuous, repeated, or intermittent from the same source.
    *   **Shape:** Sharp rise (like point source) but the fall is interrupted or extended. It may show a plateau or **secondary waves/peaks**.
    *   **Key Feature:** The outbreak continues beyond the range of one incubation period.
    *   **Examples:** A contaminated well used daily, a prostitute in a gonorrhea outbreak, **[[Legionnaire's disease]]** (Philadelphia 1976).

**2. Propagated Epidemics**
*   **Exposure:** Results from **person-to-person transmission** of an infectious agent.
*   **Shape:** **Gradual rise and gradual fall**. The curve often has a "tail".
*   **Key Feature:** Transmission continues until the number of susceptibles is depleted or **[[Herd immunity]]** is reached.
*   **Speed of Spread:** Depends on herd immunity, opportunities for contact, and secondary attack rate.
*   **Examples:** Measles, Polio, Hepatitis A, HIV, Tuberculosis.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> 1. Point Source: A steep, bell-shaped curve confined to a short duration.
> 2. Continuous Source: A curve that rises and stays elevated or fluctuates for a long time.
> 3. Propagated: A series of progressively taller peaks, each one incubation period apart, merging into a long irregular curve.

#### **Comparison of Epidemic Types**

| Feature | Point Source (Common Source) | Continuous/Repeated Source | Propagated Epidemic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Exposure** | Brief, simultaneous | Prolonged, Intermittent | Person-to-person contact |
| **Onset** | Explosive / Rapid | Rapid rise | Gradual |
| **Duration** | Within **one** incubation period | Extends beyond one incubation period | Long duration, multiple generations |
| **Secondary Waves**| Absent | Present/Plateau | Present (Successive waves) |
| **Examples** | Food poisoning, Cholera (Broad St. Pump) | Contaminated well water | Measles, Hepatitis A |

#### **Mnemonic: "PEP" for Curves**
*   **P**oint source = **P**eak (Single, sharp).
*   **E**xtended source = **E**xtended duration (Continuous).
*   **P**ropagated = **P**erson-to-**P**erson (Gradual).

#### **Clinical & Public Health Relevance**
*   **John Snow's Spot Map:** In 1854, **[[John Snow]]** used descriptive epidemiology (spot map of fatal cases) to identify the Broad Street Pump as the source of a Cholera epidemic in London. This is a classic example of a common source epidemic investigation leading to control (removing the pump handle).
*   **Evaluation:** Analysis of the curve allows public health officials to assess if control measures are working or if the nature of the agent is changing.
