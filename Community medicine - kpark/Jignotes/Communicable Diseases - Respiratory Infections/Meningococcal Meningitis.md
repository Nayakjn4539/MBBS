# [[Communicable Diseases - Respiratory Infections]] > Meningococcal Meningitis

# [[Meningococcal Meningitis]] (Cerebrospinal Fever)

An acute communicable disease caused by *N. meningitidis*, characterized by inflammation of the meninges. It is a medical emergency with high case fatality if untreated. It occurs sporadically and in epidemics, notably in the "African Meningitis Belt."

### Epidemiological Determinants

**1. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** [[Neisseria meningitidis]] (Meningococcus).
*   **Characteristics:** Gram-negative, kidney-shaped diplococci. It is a delicate organism and dies rapidly outside the human body (susceptible to heat and cold).
*   **Serogroups:** At least 13 serogroups exist. Groups **A, B, C, W135, Y**, and **X** are the major causes of disease.
    *   **Group A:** Historically responsible for major epidemics (especially in the African belt).
    *   **Group B:** Often associated with sporadic cases.
*   **Resistance:** Readily killed by heating and disinfectants.

**2. Reservoir of Infection**
*   **Strictly Human Reservoir:** No animal reservoir exists.
*   **Source:** Cases and Carriers.
*   **Importance of Carriers:**
    *   [[Carriers]] are the *most important* source of infection. Clinical cases have low infectivity.
    *   **Temporary Carriers:** Duration ~10 months.
    *   **Carrier Rate:** Increases significantly during epidemics (up to 70-80%), compared to inter-epidemic periods (4-35%).

**3. Host Factors**
*   **Age:** Predominantly affects **children and young adults**. Infants (3-12 months) have the highest attack rate due to loss of maternal antibodies.
*   **Immunity:** Acquired through subclinical infection (most common), clinical disease, or vaccination.
*   **Predisposing Factors:** Asplenia, complement deficiencies, and viral respiratory infections.

**4. Environmental Factors**
*   **Season:** More common in dry and cold months (December to June in endemic zones).
*   **Overcrowding:** High risk in barracks, refugee camps, hostels, and schools,.

### Transmission
*   **Mode:** **Droplet infection** (direct person-to-person contact).
*   **Portal of Entry:** Nasopharynx.
*   **Incubation Period (IP):** Usually **3 to 4 days** (Range: 2–10 days),.
*   **Period of Communicability:** Until meningococci are no longer present in discharges. Cases become non-infectious within **24 hours** of starting specific antibiotic treatment.

### Clinical Picture
The disease spectrum includes three variants:
1.  **Nasopharyngitis:** Mild, often missed (acts as carrier).
2.  **Meningococcemia:** Acute septicemia, fever, and **petechial rash** (hemorrhagic spots).
3.  **Meningitis:** The classical presentation,.

**Key Symptoms:**
*   Sudden onset of high fever ($38^{\circ}\text{C} - 40^{\circ}\text{C}$).
*   Intense headache (bursting type).
*   Projectile vomiting.
*   [[Nuchal rigidity]] (Stiff neck).
*   Photophobia.

**Physical Signs:**
*   **Kernig’s Sign:** Pain in hamstrings upon extension of the knee with hip flexed.
*   **Brudzinski’s Sign:** Flexion of knees in response to flexion of the neck.
*   **Rash:** Petechial/purpuric rash (hallmark of meningococcemia).

**Complications:**
*   **Waterhouse-Friderichsen Syndrome:** Massive adrenal hemorrhage leading to shock and death.
*   Deafness, hydrocephalus, cranial nerve palsies.

### Diagnosis
1.  **CSF Examination:**
    *   **Gram Stain:** Gram-negative diplococci (intracellular/extracellular).
    *   **Biochemistry:** Decreased glucose, increased protein.
    *   **Cytology:** Polymorphonuclear leukocytosis.
2.  **Culture:** Blood or CSF culture (Gold Standard).
3.  **Rapid Tests:** Latex agglutination for antigen detection.

### Management

#### 1. Treatment of Cases
*   **Early treatment** saves 95% of lives.
*   **Drug of Choice (DOC):** **[[Penicillin G]]** (crystalline).
    *   *Dose:* 3-5 million units IV every 6 hours.
*   **Alternatives:** [[Ceftriaxone]] or Chloramphenicol (for Penicillin allergy).
*   **Note:** Treatment of the active case does *not* significantly alter the spread of the epidemic because carriers outnumber cases.

#### 2. Management of Contacts (Chemoprophylaxis)
Indicated for close contacts (household, daycare) to eradicate the carrier state.
*   **Drug of Choice:** **[[Rifampicin]]**.
    *   *Dose:* 600 mg BD for 2 days (Adults).
*   **Alternatives:**
    *   [[Ciprofloxacin]] (Single dose 500 mg).
    *   Ceftriaxone (IM single dose).

> **Clinical Relevance:** Penicillin treats the *disease* but does **not** eradicate the *carrier state* effectively. Therefore, a patient treated with penicillin still needs rifampicin or ciprofloxacin before discharge to clear nasopharyngeal carriage.

#### 3. Vaccination
Used for high-risk groups (military, travelers to Hajj/endemic zones) and outbreak control.

| Feature | **Polysaccharide Vaccine** | **Conjugate Vaccine** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Types** | Bivalent (A, C) or Quadrivalent (A, C, Y, W135) | Monovalent (A or C) or Quadrivalent |
| **Age** | Not effective in children < 2 years | Effective in infants and young children |
| **Immunity** | Short-lasting (3 years) | Long-lasting (Immunologic memory) |
| **Carrier Effect** | Does not reduce carriage significantly | Reduces nasopharyngeal carriage (Herd immunity) |
| **Route** | Subcutaneous | IM/Subcutaneous |

*   **Group B Vaccine:** Effective vaccines for Serogroup B are difficult to produce because the Group B polysaccharide is non-immunogenic (it mimics human neural tissue).
*   **Contraindications:** Pregnancy (relative), infants < 2 years (for polysaccharide types).

### Mnemonics

**For Treatment vs. Prophylaxis:**
*   **P**enicillin for the **P**atient (Treatment).
*   **R**ifampicin for the **R**elatives (Prophylaxis).

**For Clinical Signs:**
*   **Brudzinski** = **B**rain says bend (Neck flexion causes knee flexion).
*   **Kernig** = **K**nee extension causes pain.
