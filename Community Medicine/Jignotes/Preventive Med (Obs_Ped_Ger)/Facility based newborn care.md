### Facility Based Newborn Care (FBNC)

[[Facility Based Newborn Care]] is a key strategy under the [[National Health Mission (NHM)]] and [[RCH-II]] to improve newborn survival by establishing a network of newborn care facilities at different levels of the health system. The primary objective is to reduce the [[Neonatal Mortality Rate]] (NMR) by providing appropriate care to sick and low birth weight newborns.

#### Levels of Facility Based Newborn Care

The operational guidelines structure newborn care into three distinct levels based on the facility capability:

| Level of Care | Health Facility | Designated Unit | Target Group |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Level I** | Sub-Centre (SC) / Primary Health Centre (PHC) | **Newborn Care Corner (NBCC)** | All newborns at birth; Prompt referral of sick ones. |
| **Level II** | Community Health Centre (CHC) / First Referral Unit (FRU) | **Newborn Stabilization Unit (NBSU)** (+ NBCC in Labour room/OT) | Sick newborns needing stabilization; Low Birth Weight babies. |
| **Level III** | District Hospital / Medical Colleges | **Special Newborn Care Unit (SNCU)** (+ NBCC) | Sick newborns requiring specialized care (except assisted ventilation/major surgery). |

---

#### 1. Newborn Care Corner (NBCC)
*   **Location:** Mandatory within the **labour room** and **operation theatre** of *every* facility where deliveries occur.
*   **Function:** Provides immediate care at birth.
    *   Resuscitation.
    *   Provision of warmth (prevention of [[Hypothermia]]).
    *   Early initiation of [[Breastfeeding]].
    *   Weighing the baby.
*   **Equipment:** Radiant warmer, suction machine, oxygen source, resuscitation kit (bag and mask).

#### 2. Newborn Stabilization Unit (NBSU)
*   **Location:** Established at **CHCs** and **FRUs**.
*   **Infrastructure:**
    *   Located in or near the maternity ward.
    *   **4-bedded unit**.
    *   Must have 2 beds in the postnatal ward for **rooming-in**.
*   **Functions:**
    *   Stabilization of sick newborns before referral.
    *   Care for low birth weight babies (>1800g).
    *   Phototherapy for jaundice.
    *   Management of sepsis with first-line antibiotics.

#### 3. Special Newborn Care Unit (SNCU)
*   **Location:** **District Hospitals** or Sub-district hospitals with >3000 deliveries/year.
*   **Infrastructure:**
    *   **Minimum 12 beds** (Add 4 beds for every 1000 additional deliveries).
    *   Requires 4 additional beds for **Step-Down Unit** (where mother and baby stay together).
    *   Area: approx. 100 sq. ft per bed.
*   **Staffing:** Requires 24x7 coverage by Pediatricians/Medical Officers and trained nurses.
*   **Functions:** All care for sick newborns *except* major surgery and invasive mechanical ventilation.

#### Triage of Sick Newborns at Facilities
Rapid assessment is done to categorize newborns into three groups for prioritizing management.

> A flowchart showing the three color-coded categories of triage (Pink, Yellow, Green) and the action plan for each

| Category | Color Code | Signs/Symptoms | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Emergency** | **PINK** | • Hypothermia (<36°C)<br>• Apnea/Gasping<br>• Severe respiratory distress<br>• Central Cyanosis<br>• Shock (CFT >3 sec)<br>• Convulsions/Coma | **Urgent Intervention.**<br>Stabilize and admit to SNCU immediately. |
| **Priority** | **YELLOW** | • Cold stress (36-36.4°C)<br>• Restless/Irritable<br>• Severe Jaundice/Pallor<br>• Abdominal distension<br>• Weight <1800g | **Rapid Assessment.**<br>Admit to SNCU. |
| **Non-Urgent** | **GREEN** | • Transitional stools<br>• Minor birth trauma<br>• Superficial infections<br>• Minor malformations | **Assess and Counsel.**<br>Home management or OPD care. |

#### Criteria for Admission to SNCU
Any newborn presenting with the following should be admitted:
*   **Birth Weight:** <1800 gm or Gestation <34 weeks.
*   **Large baby:** >4.0 kg.
*   **Respiratory:** Apnea, gasping, severe distress (Rate >60/min + retractions).
*   **CNS:** Convulsions, coma, encephalopathy.
*   **Infection:** Sepsis, severe jaundice (appearing <24 hrs).
*   **Temperature:** Hypothermia (<35.4°C) or Hyperthermia (>37.5°C).
*   **Feeding:** Refusal to feed.

#### Criteria for Discharge
A baby is ready for discharge from SNCU when:
1.  Maintains temperature without a radiant warmer.
2.  Hemodynamically stable (normal CFT, strong pulse).
3.  Accepting **breastfeeds** well.
4.  Documented weight gain for **3 consecutive days**.
5.  Mother is confident in caring for the baby.
