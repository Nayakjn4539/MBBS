# [[Occupational Health]] > Occupational Cancers and Dermatitis

### **Occupational Cancers**

Occupational cancer is a serious problem in industry, where the body sites most commonly affected are the skin, lungs, bladder, and blood-forming organs.

**1. Skin Cancer**
*   **Prevalence:** It accounts for nearly **75%** of all occupational cancers,.
*   **Historical Significance:** First identified by [[Percival Pott]] in 1775 as cancer of the scrotum in chimney sweeps.
*   **Type:** Predominantly [[Squamous cell carcinoma]].
*   **Sites:** Exposed parts (head, neck, hands, arms) in direct contact with the carcinogen.
*   **Causative Agents:** Coal tar, X-rays, certain oils, dyes, pitch, and soot.
*   **High-risk Occupations:** Gas workers, coke oven workers, tar distillers, road makers, and dye-stuff makers.

**2. Lung Cancer**
*   **Risk Factors:** More than 90% of lung cancers are attributed to tobacco smoking, air pollution, and occupational exposure.
*   **Causative Agents & Industries:**
    *   **Nickel & Chromates:** Gas industry, nickel/chromium work.
    *   **Asbestos:** Causes [[Mesothelioma]] and lung cancer.
    *   **Arsenic:** Roasting plants.
    *   **Radioactive substances:** Uranium mining.
    *   **Coal tar:** Presumably 3-4 benzpyrene.

**3. Bladder Cancer**
*   **Etiology:** Caused by aromatic amines which are metabolized in the body and excreted in urine.
*   **Causative Agents:** Beta-naphthylamines, Benzidine, Para-amino-diphenyl, Auramine, Magenta.
*   **High-risk Industries:** Dye-stuffs, dyeing industry, rubber, gas, and electric cable industries.
*   **Clinical Feature:** The most common symptom is [[Haematuria]] (blood in urine).
*   **Treatment:** Immunotherapy with Intravesical [[BCG instillation]] is used to treat and prevent recurrence of superficial tumors.

**4. Leukemia**
*   **Causative Agents:** Benzol (a solvent), Roentgen rays (X-rays), and radioactive substances.
*   **Note:** Benzol is a dangerous chemical used as a solvent in many industries; leukemia may appear long after exposure ceases.

#### **Characteristics of Occupational Cancers**
1.  Appear after prolonged exposure.
2.  **Long Latent Period:** 10 to 25 years.
3.  Disease may develop even after cessation of exposure.
4.  Average age incidence is earlier than general cancer.
5.  Localization is remarkably constant in any one occupation.

#### **Prevention and Control**
*   **Elimination/Control:** Exclusion of carcinogens, closed system production, well-designed buildings.
*   **Medical Measures:** Periodic medical examinations and inspection of factories.
*   **Personal Hygiene:** Critical for preventing skin cancers.
*   **Education:** Educating workers and management about risks.
*   **Notification and Licensing:** Of establishments handling carcinogens.

### **Occupational Dermatitis**

Occupational dermatitis is a major health problem in many industries.

#### **Causes**
| Category | Agents |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Physical** | Heat, cold, moisture, friction, pressure, X-rays. |
| **Chemical** | Acids, alkalis, dyes, solvents, grease, tar, pitch. <br> *Classified into:* <br> 1. **Primary Irritants:** Cause dermatitis in sufficient concentration (e.g., acids, alkalis). <br> 2. **Sensitizers:** Cause allergic dermatitis (e.g., photographic chemicals). |
| **Biological** | Viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites. |
| **Plant Products** | Leaves, vegetables, fruits, flowers, vegetable dust. |

#### **Prevention of Occupational Dermatitis**
*Mnemonic: **P4***

1.  **Pre-selection (Pre-placement exam):** Medical examination before employment. Persons with established dermatitis or known predisposition (skin disease) should be kept away from hazardous jobs.
2.  **Protection:** Use of protective clothing (long leather gloves, aprons, boots) and barrier creams.
3.  **Personal Hygiene:** Availability of warm water, soap, and towels. Workers must be educated to use them frequently.
4.  **Periodic Inspection:** Periodic medical check-ups for early detection and treatment. Workers should report even mild skin irritation immediately.
