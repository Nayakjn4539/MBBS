# Assessment of Contrast Sensitivity

[[Contrast Sensitivity]] is the ability of the eye to perceive slight changes in [[Luminance]] between regions which are not separated by definite borders. While [[Visual Acuity]] measures the spatial resolution (Form Sense) using high-contrast targets (black letters on a white background), contrast sensitivity assesses the "quality of vision" and the ability to distinguish objects from their background under varying lighting conditions (e.g., fog, night driving),.

### Importance of Assessment
Loss of contrast sensitivity results in mild fogginess of vision. It is a more sensitive indicator of visual function loss than Snellen acuity in certain pathologies. A patient may have 6/6 (20/20) visual acuity but severe complaints of visual quality due to poor contrast sensitivity,.

### Factors Affecting Contrast Sensitivity
Contrast sensitivity may be impaired in the presence of normal visual acuity in the following conditions:
*   **Refractive errors**
*   **Age:** Decreases with advancing age.
*   **[[Glaucoma]]:** May show early loss.
*   **[[Cataract]]:** Particularly early stages or posterior subcapsular opacities where CS is affected before high-contrast visual acuity,.
*   **[[Amblyopia]]**
*   **[[Diabetic Retinopathy]]**
*   **Optic Nerve Diseases:** e.g., [[Optic Neuritis]], [[Multiple Sclerosis]], [[Papilloedema]].
*   **Refractive Surgery:** Post-[[LASIK]] or PRK.

### Methods of Assessment

Tests for contrast sensitivity generally use either **letters** (optotypes) or **gratings** (stripes) with varying degrees of contrast.

#### 1. Letter Contrast Sensitivity Tests
These tests use standard letters where the contrast of the letters decreases gradually, but the size usually remains constant or varies log-arithmically.

*   **[[Pelli-Robson Chart]]**:
    *   **Description:** This is the most commonly used clinical test,.
    *   **Structure:** It consists of rows of letters arranged in **triplets** (groups of three).
    *   **Contrast:** The contrast is high at the top and decreases from one triplet to the next (Logarithmic progression),.
    *   **Procedure:** The chart is placed at a distance of **1 meter**. The patient is asked to read the smallest/faintest letter possible. The score is determined by the last triplet read correctly,.

*   **Bailey-Lovie Contrast Chart**: Uses letters of varying sizes and contrasts.
*   **Regan Chart**: Similar to Snellen charts but printed at varied contrast levels (e.g., 96%, 50%, 25%, 10%).

#### 2. Grating Contrast Sensitivity Tests
These tests use **sine-wave gratings** (bars) of varying **spatial frequency** (width of bars) and contrast.

*   **[[Arden Gratings]]**: Uses printed plates with sinusoidal grating patterns,.
*   **Cambridge Low-Contrast Gratings**:
    *   The subject must identify the orientation or presence of gratings on a blank card.
    *   Gratings of decreasing contrast are presented until the observer cannot distinguish the grating from the blank page.
*   **Vistech Chart / [[Functional Acuity Contrast Test]] (FACT)**:
    *   Consists of rows of sine-wave gratings.
    *   **Variables:**
        *   **Spatial Frequency:** Increases from top to bottom (bars get thinner).
        *   **Contrast:** Decreases from left to right.
    *   **Procedure:** The patient identifies the orientation of the gratings (tilted left, right, or vertical).
*   **Sloan and Lea Low Contrast Charts**: Often used for pediatric or illiterate patients.

### Comparison of Methods

| Test Type | Examples | Features | Clinical Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Letter Charts** | **Pelli-Robson**, Bailey-Lovie, Regan | Measures ability to see low contrast *forms* (letters). Easier for patients to understand. | Screening for [[Cataract]], [[Optic Neuritis]], [[Glaucoma]]. |
| **Grating Tests** | **Arden**, Cambridge, **FACT** (Vistech) | Measures sensitivity to *spatial frequencies* (bar widths). More comprehensive analysis of visual channels. | Detailed evaluation of neural pathways; Research. |

### Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF) Curve
When testing with gratings, the results are often plotted on a curve:
*   **X-axis:** Spatial Frequency (cycles per degree) — Represents target size (Low freq = thick bars; High freq = thin bars).
*   **Y-axis:** Contrast Sensitivity (Reciprocal of contrast threshold).
*   **Normal Curve:** Inverted 'U' shape. The eye is most sensitive to middle spatial frequencies.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Cataract:** Contrast sensitivity is affected *before* Snellen visual acuity. Patients often complain of glare disability while driving at night,.
*   **Optic Neuritis:** CS is markedly reduced. In recovered optic neuritis, visual acuity may return to 6/6, but contrast sensitivity often remains permanently impaired.
*   **Glaucoma:** Loss of CS may precede visual field defects.
*   **Refractive Surgery:** Patients may have 6/6 vision post-LASIK but complain of poor quality of vision due to reduced CS.
