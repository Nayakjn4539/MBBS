# [[Environment And Health]] > Medical Entomology Insecticides and Control Measures

### Medical Entomology: Insecticides and Control Measures

**Medical Entomology** is the study of arthropods of medical importance. Control of these vectors is crucial for preventing diseases like Malaria, Dengue, Filariasis, and Plague. The control measures are broadly classified into Environmental, Chemical, Biological, and Genetic methods.

### **1. Classification of Insecticides**

Insecticides are substances used to kill insects. They are classified based on their mode of action and chemical nature.

#### **A. Based on Mode of Action**
1.  **Contact Poisons:** Kill insects primarily by contact (absorbed through the cuticle).
    *   *Examples:* [[DDT]], [[HCH]] (BHC), Dieldrin, Malathion.
2.  **Stomach Poisons:** Cause death when ingested. Used for chewing insects or larvae.
    *   *Example:* [[Paris Green]] (Copper acetoarsenite) - primarily for Anopheles larvae.
3.  **Fumigants (Respiratory Poisons):** Give off lethal vapors absorbed through the spiracles.
    *   *Examples:* Hydrogen Cyanide (HCN), Methyl Bromide, Sulphur dioxide.
4.  **Repellents:** Deter arthropods from attacking.
    *   *Examples:* [[DEET]] (Diethyl toluamide), Dimethyl phthalate (DMP).

#### **B. Based on Chemical Nature**

| Group | Examples | Key Features & Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Natural (Plant origin)** | [[Pyrethrum]], Rotenone | • **Space spray** (Knock-down effect).<br>• Nerve poison.<br>• No residual action (short-lived). |
| **Organochlorines** | [[DDT]], [[BHC]] (Lindane), Dieldrin | • **Contact poisons**.<br>• High residual effect (persists for months/years).<br>• Environmental hazard (Biomagnification). |
| **Organophosphates** | [[Malathion]], Fenthion, Abate ([[Temephos]]) | • **Inhibit Cholinesterase**.<br>• Biodegradable but toxic to humans.<br>• Used where resistance to DDT exists. |
| **Carbamates** | Propoxur (Baygon), Carbaryl | • Similar action to organophosphates.<br>• Reversible cholinesterase inhibition. |
| **Synthetic Pyrethroids** | Permethrin, Deltamethrin, Cyfluthrin | • Highly effective, low mammalian toxicity.<br>• Used in **ITBN** and **LLIN** (Bed nets). |

### **2. Specific Important Insecticides (Exam High Yields)**

#### **[[DDT]] (Dichloro-Diphenyl-Trichloroethane)**
*   **Action:** Contact nerve poison.
*   **Application:** Primarily as **Indoor Residual Spray (IRS)**.
*   **Dosage:** 100–200 mg per sq. foot (1–2 g/m²).
*   **Residual Action:** Lasts for **6 to 18 months**.
*   **Toxicity:** Nervous system excitability. *Warning:* Banned in many countries due to environmental persistence, but restricted use allowed for public health in some endemic regions.

#### **[[BHC]] (Benzene Hexachloride) / HCH**
*   **Active Agent:** **Gamma isomer** (Gamma-HCH) is the most active fraction (also called **Lindane**).
*   **Potency:** More toxic to insects than DDT but has a shorter residual action (approx. 3 months).
*   **Application:** 25–50 mg/sq. foot.

#### **[[Malathion]]**
*   **Type:** Organophosphate.
*   **Safety:** **Least toxic** to humans among organophosphates.
*   **Use:** Alternative to DDT in resistant areas; used in **ULV (Ultra Low Volume)** fogging for epidemics.
*   **Antidote for Poisoning:** [[Atropine]].

#### **[[Paris Green]]**
*   **Type:** Stomach poison.
*   **Target:** **Anopheles larvae** (Surface feeders).
*   **Application:** Sprayed as 2% dust on water surfaces.
*   **Limitation:** Not effective against Culex (bottom feeders) or pupae (do not feed).

#### **[[Abate]] (Temephos)**
*   **Type:** Organophosphate.
*   **Use:** **Potable water** larvicide (e.g., for Guinea worm cyclops or Aedes in containers).
*   **Safety:** Safe for humans at 1 ppm concentration.

### **3. Mosquito Control Measures**

Control is generally divided into Anti-larval and Anti-adult measures.

#### **A. Anti-Larval Measures**
1.  **Environmental Control (Source Reduction):** *The Best Method.*
    *   Elimination of breeding places (filling ditches).
    *   Water management (intermittent irrigation).
    *   Desilting and de-weeding (for Mansonia).
2.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Mineral Oils:** (Kerosene, Diesel, MLO). Forms a film on water $\rightarrow$ cuts off oxygen $\rightarrow$ suffocation. Kills larvae and pupae.
    *   **Paris Green:** Stomach poison for Anopheles.
    *   **Synthetic Larvicides:** Fenthion, Temephos (Abate).
3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Use of **Larvivorous Fish**: *Gambusia affinis* and *Poecilia reticulata* (Guppy).
    *   *Gambusia* is preferred for clean water; *Poecilia* for polluted water.
    *   **Biolarvicides:** *Bacillus thuringiensis* var. *israelensis* (Bti).

#### **B. Anti-Adult Measures**
1.  **Residual Sprays (IRS):**
    *   Spraying internal walls/ceilings where mosquitoes rest.
    *   Uses DDT, Malathion, or Lindane.
    *   Effectiveness depends on the mosquito being **Endophilic** (indoor resting).
2.  **Space Sprays (Fogging):**
    *   Application of pesticide as mist/fog (ULV).
    *   Uses **Pyrethrum** extract or Malathion.
    *   Effect is **immediate but temporary** (kills flying insects).
    *   Used mainly for epidemic control (e.g., Dengue outbreaks).
3.  **Genetic Control:**
    *   Sterile Male Technique.
    *   Cytoplasmic incompatibility.

#### **C. Personal Protection**
*   **Mosquito Nets:**
    *   Hole size should be **< 0.0475 inch** diameter.
    *   **[[ITBN]] (Insecticide Treated Bed Nets):** Dipped in synthetic pyrethroids (Deltamethrin). Needs re-treatment every 6 months.
    *   **[[LLIN]] (Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets):** Insecticide incorporated into fiber. Effective for **3 years** or 20 washes.
*   **Screening:** Of houses/windows.
*   **Repellents:** DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide).

### **4. Integrated Vector Management (IVM)**
The current WHO strategy is **IVM**. It avoids excessive reliance on chemicals. It combines:
*   Environmental management.
*   Biological control.
*   Chemical methods (judicious use).
*   Personal protection.
*   Legislative measures.

---

### **5. Insecticide Resistance**
*   **Definition:** Ability of insects to tolerate doses of toxicants that would be lethal to a normal population.
*   **Mechanism:** Enzymatic detoxification, reduced penetration, or target site insensitivity.
*   **Double Resistance:** Resistance to both DDT and HCH groups. In such cases, Organophosphates or Carbamates must be used.

---

### **Mnemonics for Revision**

**"M-O-S-T"** (Mosquito Control Strategy)
*   **M**anagement of Environment (Source reduction).
*   **O**rganic/Chemical control (Larvicides/Adulticides).
*   **S**creening/Protection (Nets).
*   **T**raining/Biological control (Fish).

**"DDT"** (Properties of DDT)
*   **D**uration: Long residual action (18 months).
*   **D**usted: Used as indoor residual spray.
*   **T**remors: Acts as a nerve poison (contact).
