# [[Nose]] > External Nose

### **External Nose: Anatomy and Physiology**

The [[external nose]] is a pyramidal structure with its **root** superiorly (continuous with the forehead) and the **base** directed downwards. It performs cosmetic, respiratory, and protective functions.

---

### **1. Surface Anatomy and Landmarks**

*   **Root:** Upper part where the nose attaches to the forehead.
*   **Dorsum:** The ridge connecting the root to the tip.
    *   Upper part: **Bridge** (formed by nasal bones).
*   **Tip (Apex):** The free, lower angle of the nose.
*   **Nares (Nostrils):** Two elliptical openings at the base, separated by the columella.
*   **Columella:** The fleshy lower margin of the [[nasal septum]] separating the nostrils.
*   **Ala Nasi:** The rounded, lateral wings of the nose.
*   **Naso-facial groove:** Separates the nose from the cheek.
*   **Alar groove:** A depression above the ala.

### **2. Osteocartilaginous Framework**

The structural support is divided into the upper bony vault and the lower cartilaginous vault.

#### **A. Bony Framework (Upper 1/3)**
Rigid support formed by:
1.  **Nasal Bones (Paired):** Fuse medially to form the bridge.
2.  **Nasal process of Frontal bone:** Superiorly.
3.  **Frontal process of Maxilla:** Laterally.

#### **B. Cartilaginous Framework (Lower 2/3)**
Flexible support formed by hyaline cartilage:

| **Cartilage** | **Description & Function** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Upper Lateral Cartilages (ULC)** | Paired, triangular. Fuse medially with the [[septal cartilage]]. Their lower free margin forms the **limen nasi** (nasal valve). |
| **Lower Lateral Cartilages (LLC)** | Also called **Alar Cartilages**. U-shaped. <br>• **Medial Crus:** Forms the columella.<br>• **Lateral Crus:** Forms the ala.<br>• **Intermediate Crus:** Defines the tip. |
| **Lesser Alar (Sesamoid) Cartilages** | Small cartilages lying lateral to the LLC; provide accessory support. |
| **Septal Cartilage** | Unpaired, midline. Its anterior border supports the dorsum of the nose (supratip area). |

> **Clinical Implication:**
> *   **Supratip Depression:** Destruction of the [[septal cartilage]] (e.g., due to septal abscess or excessive SMR) leads to a saddle nose deformity because the support for the lower dorsum is lost.
> *   **Tip Support:** Relies heavily on the integrity of the Lower Lateral Cartilages (LLC) and their attachment to the septum.

### **3. Nasal Skin and Muscles**

*   **Skin Characteristics:**
    *   **Upper Part (Dorsum/Root):** Thin, loose, and freely mobile.
    *   **Lower Part (Tip/Ala):** Thick, adherent to underlying cartilage, and rich in **sebaceous glands**.
    *   **Clinical Note:** Hypertrophy of these sebaceous glands (often due to acne rosacea) leads to **[[Rhinophyma]]** (potato tumor), commonly seen in elderly males.

*   **Nasal Musculature:**
    *   Supplied by the **[[Facial nerve]]**.
    *   Includes: **Procerus**, **Nasalis** (transverse and alar parts), **Levator labii superioris alaeque nasi**, and **Depressor septi**.
    *   **Function:** Regulate the size of the anterior nares (dilation/constriction) during respiration and facial expression.

---

### **4. Nasal Vestibule**

*   The anterior, skin-lined entrance to the nasal cavity.
*   **Lining:** Stratified squamous keratinized epithelium.
*   **Contents:**
    *   **Vibrissae:** Short, stiff hairs that filter coarse particles.
    *   Sebaceous and sweat glands.
*   **Limen Nasi:** A ridge marking the junction between the skin-lined vestibule and the mucosa-lined nasal cavity proper. It corresponds to the lower margin of the [[Upper Lateral Cartilage]].

> **Clinical Implication:**
> **[[Nasal Vestibulitis]]/Furunculosis:** Infection of the hair follicles in the vestibule (usually *Staphylococcus*). Extremely painful due to tight skin adherence. Can be dangerous due to venous drainage.

---

### **5. Blood Supply**

The external nose has a rich blood supply from both the External and Internal Carotid systems.

#### **Arterial Supply**
| **System** | **Artery** | **Branch supplying Ext. Nose** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Internal Carotid** | Ophthalmic Artery | • **Dorsal Nasal artery** (root/dorsum)<br>• **External Nasal branch** of Anterior Ethmoidal artery (tip) |
| **External Carotid** | Facial Artery | • **Angular artery** (root)<br>• **Lateral Nasal artery** (ala/dorsum)<br>• **Superior Labial artery** (septum/columella) |
| **External Carotid** | Maxillary Artery | • **Infraorbital artery** (dorsum/sidewall) |

#### **Venous Drainage**
*   Drains into the **Facial vein** and **Angular vein**.
*   **Danger Area of Face:** The angular vein communicates with the **[[Ophthalmic veins]]**, which drain directly into the **[[Cavernous Sinus]]**.
*   **Clinical Significance:** Squeezing a furuncle in the nose or upper lip can lead to retrograde thrombophlebitis and **Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis** because these veins are valveless.

---

### **6. Nerve Supply**

*   **Sensory (Pain/Touch/Temperature):** Derived from the **Trigeminal Nerve (CN V)**.
    *   **Ophthalmic Division (V1):**
        *   **Infratrochlear nerve:** Root of the nose.
        *   **External Nasal nerve** (branch of Anterior Ethmoidal): Dorsum and tip.
    *   **Maxillary Division (V2):**
        *   **Infraorbital nerve:** Sidewalls, ala, and vestibule.
*   **Motor:**
    *   **Facial Nerve (CN VII):** Supplies the nasal muscles.

---

### **7. Lymphatic Drainage**

*   **External Nose & Anterior Nasal Cavity:** Drain primarily into the **[[Submandibular Lymph Nodes]]** (Level IB).
*   **Root of Nose:** May drain to the **Preauricular/Parotid nodes**.

---

### **8. The Nasal Valve**

This is the narrowest part of the nasal airway and the primary regulator of airflow.

*   **Internal Nasal Valve:** The area bounded by:
    1.  Medially: [[Nasal septum]].
    2.  Laterally: Caudal end of the **Upper Lateral Cartilage**.
    3.  Inferiorly: Floor of the pyriform aperture/anterior head of the inferior turbinate.
*   **Angle:** The normal angle between the septum and ULC is **10°–15°**.
*   **Cottle’s Test:** Used to evaluate nasal valve collapse. Pulling the cheek laterally opens the valve; if breathing improves, the test is positive (indicates valve collapse/stenosis).

---

### **9. Physiology of the External Nose**

1.  **Respiration:**
    *   Provides the entry portal for air.
    *   **Nasal Resistance:** The nasal valve provides approximately 50% of total airway resistance, which is crucial for lung expansion (creates negative intrathoracic pressure).
2.  **Filtration:**
    *   **Vibrissae** in the vestibule trap large particles (>3 microns) like dust and pollen.
3.  **Air Conditioning:**
    *   The shape of the external nose directs airflow towards the turbinates for warming and humidification.
4.  **Vocal Resonance:**
    *   Contributes to the quality of voice; obstruction leads to **hyponasality** (Rhinolalia Clausa).

---

### **Clinical Summary: Common Pathologies**

*   **Fracture Nasal Bone:** Most common facial fracture. Can be depressed (frontal blow) or angulated (lateral blow).
*   **Saddle Nose:** Depression of the dorsum due to loss of septal support (Trauma, Leprosy, Syphilis, Wegener's).
*   **Basal Cell Carcinoma:** "Rodent ulcer," common on the ala/sun-exposed skin. Pearly nodule with rolled edges.
*   **Choanal Atresia:** Congenital blockage of the posterior nasal aperture; newborns are obligate nasal breathers, so bilateral atresia is a neonatal emergency.
