# [[Irritant Poisons (Animal)]] > Cobra and Krait

### Neurotoxic Snakes: Cobra and Krait (Elapidae Family)

Snakes of the family **Elapidae** are characterized by the presence of short, fixed, grooved fangs at the anterior end of the maxilla. Their venom is primarily [[Neurotoxin|neurotoxic]], affecting the nervous system and causing respiratory paralysis. The two most medically significant snakes in this category in India are the **Cobra** (*Naja naja*) and the **Krait** (*Bungarus caeruleus*).

#### 1. Identification Features

| Feature | **Common Cobra** (*Naja naja*) | **Common Krait** (*Bungarus caeruleus*) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Head Scales** | **3rd Supralabial scale** touches the eye and nasal shield. | **4th Infralabial scale** is the largest. |
| **Hood** | Present (expands when agitated). | Absent. |
| **Markings** | Spectacle mark (binocellate) or monocellate mark on the dorsal aspect of the hood. | Steel blue/black with **white cross-bands** (stripes) across the back. |
| **Vertebral Scales**| Normal. | **Hexagonal** scales along the central row on the back. |
| **Tail** | Round/cylindrical. | Round/cylindrical. |
| **Nature** | Diurnal (active during the day). | Nocturnal (active at night). |

#### 2. Venom and Mechanism of Action

The venom is a clear, amber-colored fluid (toxalbumin).
*   **Action:** Primarily **Neurotoxic** (Curare-like action).
*   **Target:** Neuromuscular junction (NMJ).

**Specific Mechanism:**
1.  **Cobra Venom:** Acts **Post-synaptically**. It binds competitively to Acetylcholine (ACh) receptors at the motor endplate, preventing depolarization.
2.  **Krait Venom:** Acts **Pre-synaptically**. It contains $\beta$-bungarotoxin which inhibits the release of Acetylcholine from nerve terminals and damages the nerve ending.
    *   *Note:* Because Krait venom destroys the nerve terminal, the paralysis is often less reversible with antivenom and neostigmine compared to Cobra bites.

#### 3. Clinical Features

**A. Local Symptoms**
*   **Cobra Bite:**
    *   **Pain:** Severe burning pain at the bite site.
    *   **Swelling:** Rapid and extensive swelling spreading proximally.
    *   **Discoloration:** Darkening of skin, potential necrosis, and sloughing around fang marks.
    *   **Discharge:** Serosanguinous (blood-stained) fluid oozing from punctures.
*   **Krait Bite ("Occult Bite"):**
    *   **No Pain/Minimal Pain:** Often feels like an ant bite or mosquito bite.
    *   **No Swelling/Reaction:** Local signs are usually absent.
    *   *Danger:* The victim may not realize they have been bitten until systemic symptoms appear (often occurs while sleeping—**"Dead in Bed" syndrome**).

**B. Systemic Symptoms (Neurotoxic Syndrome)**
The symptoms typically follow a descending paralysis pattern.
1.  **Pre-paralytic Stage:** Vomiting, headache, giddiness, weakness/lethargy.
2.  **Paralytic Stage:**
    *   **Ptosis:** Drooping of eyelids (Earliest and most consistent sign).
    *   **Ophthalmoplegia:** External eye muscles paralyzed; victim cannot look up.
    *   **Bulbar Palsy:** The **4 D's**:
        *   **D**iplopia (Double vision).
        *   **D**ysarthria (Slurred speech/Aphonia).
        *   **D**ysphagia (Difficulty swallowing).
        *   **D**yspnea (Difficulty breathing).
    *   **Secretions:** Pooling of saliva (dribbling), inability to clear throat.
    *   **Respiratory Failure:** Paralysis of intercostal muscles and diaphragm leading to asphyxia and death.
3.  **Krait Specific Symptom:** Severe, crampy **abdominal pain** (often mistaken for appendicitis or acute abdomen).

> **Mnemonic for Neurotoxic Bite Symptoms:**
> **"VENOM"**
> **V** - Vomiting
> **E** - Eye signs (Ptosis, Diplopia)
> **N** - Neck weakness (Broken neck sign)
> **O** - Oral difficulty (Dysphagia, Dysarthria)
> **M** - Muscle paralysis (Respiratory failure)

#### 4. Diagnosis

*   **History:** Bite details, identification of snake (if killed).
*   **Clinical:** Presence of fang marks (Cobra) or history of sleeping on floor (Krait) + Ptosis/Respiratory distress.
*   **20-Minute Whole Blood Clotting Test (20-WBCT):** Usually normal (blood clots) in purely neurotoxic bites, unlike viper bites. *However, massive envenomation can sometimes cause coagulation defects.*
*   **Neostigmine Test (Diagnostic & Therapeutic):** Administering Neostigmine (anticholinesterase) improves muscle power (e.g., lifting eyelids) in Cobra bites. Less effective in Krait bites due to presynaptic damage.

#### 5. Management

1.  **First Aid:**
    *   **Immobilize:** Splint the limb to reduce lymphatic spread.
    *   **Pressure Immobilization Bandage (PIB):** Recommended for neurotoxic bites (lymphatic occlusion).
    *   *Avoid:* Tourniquets, cutting, suction, or washing the wound.
2.  **Specific Antidote:** [[Polyvalent Anti-Snake Venom]] (ASV).
    *   Effective against Cobra, Krait, Russell’s Viper, and Saw-scaled Viper.
    *   **Dose:** Initial 10 vials (100 ml) IV. Repeat based on clinical improvement.
    *   *Note:* ASV neutralizes circulating venom but cannot reverse damage already done to nerve terminals (especially in Krait bites).
3.  **Atropine + Neostigmine:**
    *   Useful in Cobra bites (Post-synaptic blockade).
    *   Protocol: Atropine (0.6 mg) followed by Neostigmine (1.5 mg) IV.
4.  **Respiratory Support:** Mechanical ventilation is life-saving once respiratory muscles are paralyzed. Ventilation may be required for days/weeks in Krait bites until nerve terminals regenerate.

#### 6. Autopsy Findings

**External:**
*   **Cobra:** Two distinct puncture marks (fang marks). Local area shows swelling, cellulitis, and tissue necrosis.
*   **Krait:** Fang marks are fine and often invisible (pin-point). No local swelling or reaction.
*   **Rigor Mortis:** Sets in early.
*   **Postmortem Staining:** Deep blue/violet (cyanosis).

**Internal:**
*   **Lungs:** Congested, edematous, petechial hemorrhages.
*   **Organs:** Generalized visceral congestion.
*   **Brain:** Congested.
*   **Stomach:** Mucosa may show patchy hemorrhages.

#### 7. Medico-legal Aspects

*   **Accidental:** Most common (snake charmers, farmers, people sleeping on the floor).
*   **Homicidal:** Rare but possible (e.g., throwing a cobra/krait on a sleeping victim).
*   **Suicidal:** Rare (seen in individuals with easy access to snakes).
*   **Cattle Poisoning:** Dead reptiles or cloth soaked in venom inserted into the rectum of cattle to simulate snake bite.
