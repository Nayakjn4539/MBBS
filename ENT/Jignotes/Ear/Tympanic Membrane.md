# [[Ear]] > Tympanic Membrane

### Definition and General Features
The [[Tympanic Membrane]] (TM), also known as the eardrum, is a thin, semitransparent, pearly-grey membrane that separates the [[External Auditory Canal]] from the [[Middle Ear]] cavity,. It acts as a window to the middle ear and plays a crucial role in sound transmission.

*   **Shape:** Oval and biconcave (tented inwards).
*   **Dimensions:**
    *   Vertical diameter: 9–10 mm,.
    *   Horizontal diameter: 8–9 mm.
    *   Thickness: 0.1 mm,.
*   **Orientation:** It is placed obliquely at an angle of **55 degrees** to the floor of the meatus. The posterosuperior part is more lateral than the anteroinferior part,.
*   **Surface Area:** Total area is ~90 mm², but the **effective vibratory area** is approximately **55 mm²** (roughly 2/3rds),.

### Embryology
The [[Tympanic Membrane]] is unique as it develops from all three germinal layers,:
1.  **Outer Layer:** Ectoderm (from the first branchial cleft).
2.  **Middle Layer:** Mesoderm (fibrous layer).
3.  **Inner Layer:** Endoderm (from the tubotympanic recess/first pharyngeal pouch).

---

### Anatomy and Structure
The TM is divided into two distinct parts based on the arrangement of the middle fibrous layer,.

#### 1. Parts of the Tympanic Membrane
| Feature | [[Pars Tensa]] | [[Pars Flaccida]] (Shrapnell's Membrane) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Location** | Lower, larger portion (approx. 4/5 of TM). | Small triangular area above the lateral process of the [[Malleus]]. |
| **Layers** | **Three layers:** Epithelial, **Fibrous**, Mucosal. | **Two layers:** Epithelial and Mucosal (Fibrous layer is absent or scant). |
| **Appearance** | Tense, thick, tough. | Lax, thin, loose, slightly pinkish,. |
| **Attachment** | Thickened periphery forms the **Annulus Tympanicus** (fibrocartilaginous ring) which sits in the [[Tympanic Sulcus]]. | Attached to the **Notch of Rivinus** (bony deficiency in the tympanic ring). |
| **Clinical Significance**| Site for central perforations and [[Myringotomy]]. | Weak area; prone to **Retraction Pockets** and Primary Acquired [[Cholesteatoma]]. |

#### 2. Histological Layers
1.  **Outer Epithelial Layer:** Continuous with the skin of the [[External Auditory Canal]]. Stratified squamous epithelium,.
2.  **Middle Fibrous Layer:** Gives strength to the drum. Contains three types of fibers,:
    *   *Radial fibers:* Radiate from the center.
    *   *Circular fibers:* Concentric rings.
    *   *Parabolic fibers.*
3.  **Inner Mucosal Layer:** Continuous with the middle ear mucosa (low columnar/cuboidal),.

**Clinical Implication:** In a healed perforation, the middle fibrous layer often does not regenerate. The resulting membrane is thin and monomeric (consisting only of epithelium and mucosa), making it prone to retraction,.

#### 3. Anatomical Landmarks
*   **[[Umbo]]:** The central point of maximum concavity where the tip of the handle of the malleus attaches,.
*   **Handle of Malleus:** Embedded in the fibrous layer; runs vertically ending at the umbo.
*   **Lateral Process of Malleus:** A knob-like projection at the upper end of the handle.
*   **Malleolar Folds:** Anterior and posterior folds extend from the lateral process to the annulus, separating the Pars Tensa from the Pars Flaccida.
*   **[[Cone of Light]]:** A triangular reflection of light seen in the **Antero-Inferior quadrant**. In the right ear, it is at 5 o'clock; in the left ear, at 7 o'clock,.

### Quadrants of Pars Tensa
For description and clinical documentation, the Pars Tensa is divided into four quadrants by a line passing through the handle of the malleus and a perpendicular line through the umbo.

| Quadrant | Contents / Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Antero-Superior (AS)** | Opening of [[Eustachian Tube]] lies anterior to this area. |
| **Antero-Inferior (AI)** | **Cone of Light**. Site for **Grommet insertion** (safe area). |
| **Postero-Superior (PS)** | Contains long process of [[Incus]], [[Stapes]], [[Oval Window]], and [[Chorda Tympani]] nerve. **Danger area** for myringotomy,. |
| **Postero-Inferior (PI)** | Site for [[Myringotomy]] in Acute Otitis Media (bulging is prominent here). |

### Blood and Nerve Supply

#### Arterial Supply
*   **Outer Surface:** Deep auricular artery (from Maxillary artery).
*   **Inner Surface:**
    *   Anterior tympanic artery (Maxillary artery).
    *   Posterior tympanic artery (Stylomastoid branch).

#### Nerve Supply,
Pain from the ear can be referred to other areas (and vice versa) due to shared nerve supply.

| Surface | Nerve | Origin | Clinical Correlation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lateral (Outer) Surface** | **Auriculotemporal** | CN V3 (Trigeminal) | Anterior half. Referred pain from teeth/TMJ. |
| | **Auricular branch (Arnold's)** | CN X (Vagus) | Posterior half. Stimulation can cause cough (Arnold's reflex). |
| | **Facial Nerve** | CN VII | Minimal contribution. |
| **Medial (Inner) Surface** | **Tympanic branch (Jacobson's)** | CN IX (Glossopharyngeal) | Referred pain from tonsillitis/throat cancer. |

### Physiology: Impedance Matching
The [[Tympanic Membrane]] is a vital component of the middle ear transformer mechanism, helping to overcome the impedance mismatch between air and cochlear fluid.

1.  **Hydraulic Action (Areal Ratio):** The effective vibratory area of the TM (55 mm²) is much larger than the [[Stapes Footplate]] (3.2 mm²). This concentrates sound energy, providing a ratio of **17:1** (increasing force).
2.  **Curved Membrane Effect (Catenary Lever):** The TM is rigidly attached at the annulus but mobile at the center. Sound energy is concentrated at the malleus handle, providing a **2:1** leverage advantage.

### Clinical Pathologies and Abnormalities

#### 1. Color Changes
*   **Pearly Grey:** Normal.
*   **Red/Congested:** Acute Otitis Media ([[ASOM]]), crying.
*   **Flamingo Pink (Schwartze Sign):** Active [[Otosclerosis]].
*   **Blue:** Hemotympanum, Secretory Otitis Media, high jugular bulb.
*   **Chalky White Plaques:** [[Tympanosclerosis]] (calcification of fibrous layer).

#### 2. Perforations,,
*   **Central Perforation:** Located in Pars Tensa; **Annulus is intact**. Seen in Tubotympanic (Safe) [[CSOM]].
*   **Marginal Perforation:** Located in Pars Tensa; **Annulus is eroded**. Seen in Squamous (Unsafe) CSOM.
*   **Attic Perforation:** Located in Pars Flaccida. Associated with **Cholesteatoma** and Unsafe CSOM.

#### 3. Retractions
Retraction pockets occur due to negative middle ear pressure (Eustachian tube dysfunction).

**Sade Classification (Pars Tensa)**,:
*   **Grade I:** Slight retraction.
*   **Grade II:** Touches incus/stapes.
*   **Grade III:** Touches promontory (Atelectasis).
*   **Grade IV:** Adherent to promontory (Adhesive Otitis Media).

**Tos Classification (Pars Flaccida)**,:
*   **Stage I:** Slight retraction, dimple.
*   **Stage II:** Touches neck of malleus.
*   **Stage III:** Limited erosion of outer attic wall.
*   **Stage IV:** Deep erosion, extensive cholesteatoma.

#### 4. Myringitis
*   **Bullous Myringitis:** Painful hemorrhagic blebs/bullae on TM. Caused by viral or Mycoplasma infections,.
*   **Granular Myringitis:** Granulation tissue on the outer surface of TM.

### Surgical Procedures

*   **[[Myringotomy]]:** Incision of the TM to drain fluid/pus.
    *   *ASOM:* Curvilinear incision in **Postero-Inferior** quadrant (bulging is max, away from ossicles).
    *   *OME (Glue Ear):* Radial incision in **Antero-Inferior** quadrant (safe area, allows grommet insertion).
    *   *Beer Can Principle:* In severe OME with thick fluid, two incisions (AS and AI) are made to facilitate drainage.
*   **[[Myringoplasty]]:** Surgical repair of a TM perforation (Type I Tympanoplasty).
    *   *Graft Material:* Temporalis fascia is preferred (autograft).
    *   *Techniques:* Underlay (medial to annulus) or Overlay (lateral to fibrous layer).
