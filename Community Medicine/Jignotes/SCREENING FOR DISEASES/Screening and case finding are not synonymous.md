# [[SCREENING FOR DISEASES]] > Screening and case finding are not synonymous

### **Introduction: Screening vs. Case Finding**

While the terms are often used interchangeably in loose conversation, in the strict epidemiological sense, **[[Screening]]** and **[[Case Finding]]** represent two distinct approaches to disease detection. The primary distinction lies in **who initiates the process** and the **status of the individual** being tested.

### **1. Definitions and Core Concepts**

*   **Screening**:
    *   Strictly speaking, this is testing for infection or disease in populations or individuals who are **not seeking health care**.
    *   It is the active search for unrecognized disease or defects in **apparently healthy** individuals.
    *   The initiative usually comes from the **investigator**, health authority, or government.

*   **Case Finding (Opportunistic Screening)**:
    *   This is the use of clinical and/or laboratory tests to detect disease in individuals who are **seeking health care for other reasons**.
    *   It capitalizes on the patient's presence in a health facility (e.g., a clinic or hospital) to look for diseases unrelated to their chief complaint.

### **2. Key Differences**

| Feature | [[Screening]] | [[Case Finding]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Target Population** | **Apparently healthy** individuals or specific population groups (e.g., all newborns, all women >30). | Individuals **already in the health system** (patients) seeking care for other ailments. |
| **Initiative** | Comes from the **Health Authority/Investigator**. People are invited/recruited to be tested. | Comes from the **Health Care Provider/Doctor**. The doctor seizes the opportunity to test. |
| **Also Known As** | Mass Screening or Prescriptive Screening (depending on context). | **[[Opportunistic Screening]]**. |
| **Example** | Serological testing for HIV in **blood donors** or the general population. | Using VDRL to detect Syphilis in **pregnant women** visiting an ANC clinic. |
| **Scope** | Often a public health measure. | Often a component of comprehensive clinical care. |

### **3. Clinical Relevance and Examples**

*   **The "Iceberg" Concept:**
    *   **Screening** targets the vast **submerged portion** of the iceberg (pre-symptomatic/hidden disease) in the general community.
    *   **Case Finding** targets the submerged portion *specifically* among those already interacting with the "tip" (healthcare system).

*   **Specific Clinical Scenarios:**
    1.  **Diabetes Mellitus:**
        *   *Screening:* A health camp is set up in a village market, inviting all adults over 40 to check their blood sugar.
        *   *Case Finding:* A 40-year-old male visits an ophthalmologist for vision correction; the doctor notices retinal changes and orders a blood sugar test, *OR* a patient visits for a fracture, and a routine urine test reveals glycosuria.
    2.  **Hypertension:**
        *   *Screening:* Measuring BP of all employees in a corporate office during a wellness drive.
        *   *Case Finding:* A patient visits a GP for a common cold, and the doctor measures their BP as a routine protocol.

### **4. Mnemonic for Remembrance**

To remember the difference between the two:

*   **S**creening = **S**earching **S**trangers
    *   (You go out to find people who didn't ask for help).
*   **C**ase **F**inding = **C**atching **F**riends (in the clinic)
    *   (You catch the disease in patients who are already "visiting" you).
