### Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)

**Definition**
[[Biochemical Oxygen Demand]] (BOD) is defined as the amount of **dissolved oxygen** needed by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at a certain temperature over a specific time period.

It is the most important test done to assess the "strength" of sewage or the extent of organic pollution in water.

**The Standard BOD Test**
The standard test measures the amount of oxygen absorbed by a sample of sewage under specific conditions:
*   **Time Period:** 5 days
*   **Temperature:** 20°C
*   **Mechanism:** [[Aerobic destruction]] of organic matter by living organisms.

**Interpretation of Values**
The BOD value indicates the organic load of the water.
*   **Natural Waters:** BOD is approximately **1 mg/litre**.
*   **Untreated Domestic Sewage:** Ranges typically around **300 mg/litre**.

**Classification of Sewage Strength**
Based on BOD levels, sewage is classified as follows:

| Strength of Sewage | BOD Level |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Weak Sewage** | < 100 mg/L |
| **Medium Sewage** | 100 - 300 mg/L |
| **Strong Sewage** | > 300 mg/L |

**Public Health & Environmental Importance**
1.  **Indicator of Pollution:** High BOD indicates high organic pollution.
2.  **Impact on Aquatic Life:** If sewage with high BOD is discharged into a river, the bacteria will consume the river's dissolved oxygen to break down the waste. This depletion of oxygen leads to the death of fish and other aquatic life.
3.  **Nuisance:** High BOD and low oxygen favor anaerobic decomposition, leading to the production of foul-smelling gases like hydrogen sulphide ([[H2S]]).
4.  **Treatment Plant Design:** It helps in determining the load on [[sewage treatment plants]] and designing appropriate purification methods (like oxidation ponds or trickling filters).

**Difference from Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)**
While BOD measures oxygen required by *biological* organisms, **COD ([[Chemical Oxygen Demand]])** measures the oxygen equivalent of the organic matter susceptible to oxidation by a strong *chemical* oxidizer (like potassium dichromate).
*   COD is faster to determine than BOD.
*   COD values are generally higher than BOD values for the same sample.

**Mnemonic**
To remember the standard test conditions:
**"BOD plays a T-20 match for 5 Days"**
*   **T-20:** Temperature **20°C**
*   **5 Days:** Duration of the test
