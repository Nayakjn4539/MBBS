# Operations of the Cornea: Surgical Instruments

## 1. Eye Speculums
Instruments used to separate the eyelids and keep them apart during ocular surgeries to provide exposure to the surgical field.

### Types and Features
*   **Universal Metallic Eye Speculum:**
    *   Can be used for either the right or left eye.
    *   Consists of two limbs and a spring mechanism with a screw to adjust the width of the limbs.
    *   The blades are open (fenestrated).
*   **Eye Speculum with Guard (Solid Blades):**
    *   Similar to the universal type but possesses solid blades.
    *   **Clinical Advantage:** The solid blades prevent the eyelashes from entering the surgical field, maintaining sterility and visibility.
*   **Wire Speculum (Barraquer’s):**
    *   Very light in weight.
    *   **Clinical Implication:** Causes minimal pressure on the [[eyeball]], making it suitable for intraocular surgeries where external pressure must be minimized.

### Uses
*   **Intraocular surgeries:** [[Cataract surgery]], [[Glaucoma surgery]], and [[Keratoplasty]].
*   **Extraocular surgeries:** [[Strabismus surgery]], [[Pterygium]] excision.
*   **Miscellaneous:** [[Enucleation]], [[Evisceration]], removal of corneal/conjunctival foreign bodies, and examination in cases of [[blepharospasm]].

## 2. Globe Fixation Forceps
Stout forceps used to stabilize the eye during surgical maneuvers.

### Features
*   The tip contains teeth, typically **2 x 3** or **3 x 4**.
*   Applied near the [[limbus]] to grasp the [[conjunctiva]] and [[episcleral tissue]] firmly.

### Clinical Uses
*   **Stabilization:** To fix the eyeball during various operations (e.g., passing a superior rectus bridle suture, making incisions).
*   **Diagnostic:** Used to hold the eyeball during the **Forced Duction Test ([[FDT]])** to differentiate restrictive from paralytic [[squint]].

## 3. Corneal Trephine
A circular cutting instrument used primarily in corneal transplantation.

### Mechanism and Procedure
*   **Function:** Used to cut a circular button of the cornea from the donor and a circular bed in the recipient [[cornea]].
*   **Donor preparation:** The donor corneal button is usually cut from the endothelial side.
*   **Recipient preparation:** A partial-thickness incision is made on the host cornea, which is then completed with scissors.

### Sizing (Clinical Importance)
The size of the [[trephine]] determines the graft size.
*   **Standard Rule:** The donor button is typically cut **0.25 mm to 0.5 mm larger** than the recipient opening.
*   **Advantages of Oversizing:**
    *   Better apposition of wound edges.
    *   Deeper [[anterior chamber]] formation.
    *   Reduced risk of [[peripheral anterior synechiae]] (PAS).
    *   Less postoperative [[glaucoma]].
    *   Induces a slightly myopic refraction.
*   **Specific Sizing Scenarios:**
    *   **[[Keratoconus]]:** 0.25 mm oversizing is preferred.
    *   **[[Aphakia]]:** 1.0 mm oversizing may be preferred.

## 4. Corneal Spring Scissors (Section Enlarging Scissors)
Delicate scissors used to extend corneal or scleral incisions.

### Features
*   **Spring Action:** The cutting blades are kept apart by a spring mechanism, allowing for fine control.
*   **Curvature:** Blades are curved to match the limbal curvature.
*   **Types:** Can be Universal (used for both sides) or Right/Left specific.
*   **Examples:** Castroviejo’s corneal scissors, Katzin’s corneal transplant scissors.

### Clinical Uses
*   **[[Keratoplasty]]:** To complete the excision of the recipient corneal button after initial trephination,.
*   **[[Cataract surgery]]:** To enlarge the corneoscleral section in conventional [[ECCE]] or [[ICCE]] (though less common now).
*   **[[Trabeculectomy]]:** To cut scleral and trabecular tissue.

## 5. Colibri Forceps
Very fine, toothed forceps designed for handling delicate corneal tissue.

### Features
*   Possesses very fine **1 x 2 teeth** at the tip.
*   Designed to hold tissue firmly without crushing or causing significant trauma.
*   Similar to **Lim’s forceps** in function and design.

### Clinical Uses
*   **Suturing:** Used to hold the corneal or scleral edge of an incision to facilitate the passage of the needle.
*   **Procedures:** Essential in [[cataract surgery]], [[glaucoma surgery]], repair of corneal tears, and [[keratoplasty]].

## 6. Needle Holder
Instruments used to grasp and manipulate surgical needles during suturing.

### Types and Features
*   **Spring Action (Barraquer’s type):**
    *   Most commonly used for microsurgery.
    *   Jaws are finely serrated to hold fine needles (like those attached to **10-0 nylon**) firmly.
    *   Can have straight or curved tips, with or without a locking mechanism.
    *   **Use:** Passing sutures in [[cornea]], [[conjunctiva]], and [[sclera]].
*   **Castroviejo’s Needle Holder:**
    *   Medium-sized with a spring action and an S-shaped locking system.
    *   **Use:** Intraocular and extraocular surgeries (e.g., [[squint surgery]]).
*   **Arruga’s / Steven’s Needle Holder:**
    *   Larger, stouter instruments.
    *   **Use:** Lid surgery and passing superior rectus bridle sutures.

| Needle Holder Type | Primary Use |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Barraquer (Spring)** | Microsurgery (Cornea/Sclera) using fine sutures (10-0) |
| **Castroviejo** | General ophthalmic surgery (Squint/Conjunctiva) |
| **Arruga/Steven** | Lid surgery, Bridle sutures (Silk sutures) |
