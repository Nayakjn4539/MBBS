# [[HEALTH PLANNING & MANAGEMENT]] > Cost effective analysis and cost benefit analysis are not synonymous

The statement "Cost effective analysis and cost benefit analysis are synonymous" is **false**. While both are [[quantitative management techniques]] used in health economics to assist decision-making, they differ fundamentally in how they measure **outcomes** (benefits).

### 1. Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)

*   **Definition:** A systematic comparison where both the **inputs (costs)** and the **outputs (benefits)** are measured in **monetary terms**.
*   **Methodology:** It attempts to value all socially relevant outcomes, including human life and suffering, in financial terms.
*   **Approaches to Value Life:**
    *   **Human Capital Approach:** Values a person based on their future productive potential (earnings).
    *   **Willingness to Pay Approach:** Based on how much individuals are willing to pay to avoid illness or death.
*   **Formula:** The utility is expressed as a **Cost-Benefit Ratio** (Total Benefits in Money / Total Costs in Money).
*   **Objective:** To determine if a program is economically sound (i.e., Do the dollar benefits exceed the dollar costs?) and to select the best option among several alternatives.
*   **Limitation:** It is ethically difficult and often technically impossible to place a monetary value on human life, pain alleviation, or disability prevention. Therefore, its application in the health field is limited.

### 2. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)

*   **Definition:** A technique where **costs** are measured in monetary terms, but **benefits** (outcomes) are expressed in **natural health units** or physical units.
*   **Units of Outcome:** Examples include:
    *   Number of [[lives saved]].
    *   Number of cases prevented.
    *   Years of life gained.
    *   Days free from disease.
    *   [[Quality Adjusted Life Years]] (QALYs).
*   **Objective:** To determine which strategy achieves the **desired health goal** at the lowest cost, or which strategy produces the maximum health benefit for a fixed budget.
*   **Advantage:** It avoids the controversy of placing a price tag on human life. It is easier to perform and is the **preferred tool** in the health sector compared to CBA.

### Key Differences: CBA vs. CEA

| Feature | Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) | Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Measurement of Costs** | Monetary terms (Money) | Monetary terms (Money) |
| **Measurement of Benefits** | **Monetary terms** (e.g., Dollars, Rupees) | **Natural Health Units** (e.g., Lives saved, cases cured) |
| **Primary Question** | "Is this program worth the investment financially?" | "What is the cheapest way to achieve this specific health goal?" |
| **Application** | Used for allocating budget across *different* sectors (e.g., Health vs. Education). | Used for comparing alternative strategies for the *same* health problem (e.g., Surgery vs. Medicine). |
| **Limitations** | Hard to value life financially; decision-maker bias. | Cannot compare interventions with totally different outcomes (e.g., Blindness prevention vs. Malaria control). |

### Clinical Relevance
In public health planning, **[[Cost-Effectiveness Analysis]]** is predominantly used.
*   **Example:** Comparing the cost per case cured of Tuberculosis using **DOTS** vs. conventional therapy. If DOTS cures more patients for the same amount of money, it is more cost-effective.
*   **Example:** Comparing the cost per immunization delivered via **Mobile Clinics** vs. **Static Centers**.

### Mnemonic
*   **B**enefit = **B**ank (**B**alance sheet) $\rightarrow$ Results in **Money**.
*   **E**ffectiveness = **E**ffect (**E**fficacy) $\rightarrow$ Results in **Health Outcomes** (Lives/Cures).
