# [[Communicable Diseases - Respiratory Infections]] > National Tuberculosis Elimination Program - Structure and Guidelines

# National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP)

## 1. Evolution and Vision
*   **Former Name:** Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme ([[RNTCP]]).
*   **Current Name:** National Tuberculosis Elimination Program ([[NTEP]]) (Renamed in 2019 to emphasize the goal of elimination).
*   **Vision:** TB-Free India with zero deaths, disease, and poverty due to tuberculosis.
*   **Goal:** To achieve a rapid decline in the burden of TB, morbidity, and mortality while working towards the elimination of TB in India by **2025** (Five years ahead of the Global SDG target of 2030).

## 2. Epidemiology of Tuberculosis
*   **Agent Factor:** *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (Acid-fast bacilli).
    *   *Source:* Human cases (sputum positive). Bovine TB is rare in India.
*   **Host Factor:** Affects all ages, more common in males. Risk factors include HIV, diabetes, malnutrition, smoking, and overcrowding.
*   **Transmission:** **[[Airborne transmission]]** via droplet nuclei (1-5 microns) generated by coughing/sneezing.
*   **Incubation Period:** Variable (weeks to years). Latent infection can reactivate.
*   **Clinical Picture:**
    *   Persistent cough (> 2 weeks), fever (evening rise), night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis, chest pain.
    *   **Mnemonic for Symptoms:** **C-A-W-S** (Cough, Afternoon fever, Weight loss, Sweating).

## 3. Organizational Structure of NTEP
The program operates under the **National Health Mission (NHM)**.

### Administrative Levels
1.  **National Level:** Central TB Division (CTD) under Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW).
2.  **State Level:** State TB Cell headed by **[[State Tuberculosis Officer (STO)]]**.
3.  **District Level:** District TB Centre (DTC) headed by **[[District Tuberculosis Officer (DTO)]]**.
4.  **Sub-District Level:** **[[Tuberculosis Unit (TU)]]**.
    *   One TU per **1.5 - 2.5 Lakh** population (Urban/Rural).
    *   One TU per **0.75 - 1.25 Lakh** population (Hilly/Tribal/Difficult areas).
    *   **Key TU Personnel:**
        *   **Medical Officer - TB Control (MO-TC)**.
        *   **[[Senior Treatment Supervisor (STS)]]**: Monitoring treatment.
        *   **[[Senior TB Laboratory Supervisor (STLS)]]**: Monitoring microscopy quality.
5.  **Peripheral Health Institute (PHI):** Hospitals, CHCs, PHCs, Dispensaries.
6.  **Diagnostic Centers:**
    *   **Designated Microscopy Center (DMC):** One per **1 Lakh** population (50,000 in tribal/hilly areas).
    *   **NAAT Sites:** CBNAAT/TrueNat labs at district/block levels.

## 4. Diagnostic Guidelines (NTEP)

### Identification of Presumptive TB Case
*   **Adults:** Cough for ≥ 2 weeks, fever, weight loss, night sweats, or haemoptysis.
*   **Children:** Persistent fever/cough > 2 weeks, weight loss/no weight gain, history of contact.
*   **High Risk (PLHIV):** Any duration of cough/fever is significant.

### Diagnostic Algorithms
The program has shifted from simple microscopy to **[[Upfront Molecular Testing]]**.

1.  **Preferred Tool:** **[[CBNAAT (Cartridge Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test)]]** or **TrueNat**.
    *   *Advantage:* Detects *M. tuberculosis* AND Rifampicin resistance simultaneously.
    *   *Turnaround:* Results in ~2 hours.
2.  **Sputum Microscopy:** ZN Staining / LED Fluorescence Microscopy (still used where molecular tests are unavailable or for follow-up).
    *   Two samples: Spot-Spot or Spot-Morning (Program is moving towards convenient collection).
3.  **Chest X-Ray:** Highly sensitive screening tool; used when smear/NAAT is negative but clinical suspicion remains.

**Universal Drug Susceptibility Testing (UDST):** All diagnosed TB patients must be tested for drug resistance (at least Rifampicin) prior to treatment initiation.

## 5. Treatment Guidelines (DOTS)

**[[Directly Observed Treatment Short-course (DOTS)]]** remains the core strategy, but regimens have evolved to **Daily Regimens** using Fixed Dose Combinations (FDCs).

### Drug Sensitive TB (DSTB)
*   **Regimen:** **2 H R Z E + 4 H R E**
    *   **Intensive Phase (IP):** 2 months of H, R, Z, E (Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol).
    *   **Continuation Phase (CP):** 4 months of H, R, E.
    *   *Note:* Previously treated cases (Relapse, Failure) are also treated with this regimen *unless* drug resistance is detected.

### Drug Resistant TB (DR-TB)
Treatment is complex and guided by resistance patterns.
*   **H-Mono Resistant:** 6 months of Levofloxacin + R + E + Z.
*   **MDR/RR-TB (Multidrug/Rifampicin Resistant):**
    *   **Shorter Oral Bedaquiline-containing Regimen:** 9-11 months.
    *   **Longer Oral M/XDR Regimen:** 18-20 months.
    *   *Key Drugs:* **[[Bedaquiline]]** (Novel drug), Levofloxacin, Linezolid, Clofazimine, Cycloserine.

### Pediatric TB
*   Use of dispersible, flavored FDCs.
*   Dosages based on **Weight Bands**.

**Clinical Relevance:**
*   **Adherence is Key:** Irregular treatment leads to **[[MDR-TB]]**.
*   **Side Effects:** Orange urine (Rifampicin), Peripheral neuropathy (Isoniazid - give Pyridoxine), Optic neuritis (Ethambutol), Hyperuricemia/Joint pain (Pyrazinamide).

## 6. Key Initiatives and IT Systems

*   **[[NIKSHAY]]**: A web-enabled patient management system for TB control. Mandatory notification of all TB cases (Public & Private).
*   **[[Nikshay Poshan Yojana]] (NPY):** Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) of **₹500/month** to all TB patients for nutritional support during treatment.
*   **Active Case Finding (ACF):** Health workers go door-to-door in high-risk areas (slums, tribal areas) to detect hidden cases.
*   **99 DOTS:** IT-enabled adherence monitoring using missed calls.
*   **TB Preventive Therapy (TPT):** Isoniazid preventive therapy for PLHIV and household contacts (<5 years) of TB patients. Recently expanded to older contacts in specific settings.

## 7. Prevention and Vaccine
*   **Vaccine:** **[[BCG Vaccine]]**
    *   *Type:* Live Attenuated (Danish 1331 strain).
    *   *Dose:* 0.1ml (0.05ml for neonates < 1 month).
    *   *Site:* Intradermal, Left Upper Arm.
    *   *Protection:* Protects against severe forms like TB Meningitis and Miliary TB in children; limited efficacy against adult pulmonary TB.
*   **Infection Control:** Cough etiquette, ventilation, N95 masks for healthcare workers.

## 8. National Strategic Plan (NSP) 2017-2025 Pillars
**Mnemonic: D-T-P-B** (Detect, Treat, Prevent, Build)
1.  **Detect:** Find all TB cases (Private & Public).
2.  **Treat:** Initiate correct treatment for all.
3.  **Prevent:** Emergence of TB in susceptible populations (Latent TB treatment).
4.  **Build:** Strengthen health systems and enabling policies.
