# [[NUTRITION AND HEALTH]] > Pasteurization of milk

### Pasteurization of Milk

**Definition**
[[Pasteurization]] is defined as the heating of milk to such temperatures and for such periods of time as are required to destroy any [[pathogens]] that may be present while causing **minimal changes** in the composition, flavor, and nutritive value.

**Objectives**
1.   To render milk safe for human consumption by destroying pathogenic bacteria.
2.  To improve the keeping quality (shelf-life) of milk.

**Target Organisms**
*   The process is designed to kill **90%** of bacteria in milk.
*   It specifically targets the most heat-resistant non-sporing pathogen likely to be present, which is the **[[Coxiella burnetii]]** (causative agent of Q Fever).
*   It also effectively kills **[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]**.
*   *Note:* It does **not** kill thermoduric bacteria (e.g., *Lactobacillus*) or bacterial spores.

### Methods of Pasteurization

There are three primary methods used for pasteurization:

| Method | Temperature | Time | Remarks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Holder (Vat) Method** | **63–66°C** (145-150°F) | **30 minutes** | Recommended for small/rural communities. Rapidly cooled to 5°C afterwards. |
| **2. HTST Method** (High Temperature Short Time) | **72°C** (161°F) | **15 seconds** | Also called "Flash Process". Most widely used method for large scale supplies. Rapidly cooled to 4°C. |
| **3. UHT Method** (Ultra High Temperature) | **125°C - 135°C** | **Few seconds** | Heated in two stages (2nd stage under pressure). Rapidly cooled and bottled. |

> **Crucial Step:** Regardless of the heating method, the milk must be **rapidly cooled to 4°C** immediately after heating to inhibit the growth of surviving thermoduric bacteria.

### Tests for Pasteurization Efficiency

To ensure the milk has been adequately pasteurized, specific tests are conducted:

1.  **[[Phosphatase Test]] (The most important test):**
    *   **Principle:** Raw milk contains the enzyme phosphatase, which is destroyed at temperatures slightly higher than those required to kill *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* and *Q fever* organisms.
    *   **Result:** If phosphatase is present (Positive test), it indicates **inadequate pasteurization** or the addition of raw milk. A negative test indicates satisfactory pasteurization.

2.  **[[Standard Plate Count]]:**
    *   Checks bacteriological quality.
    *   Limit: Not more than **30,000 bacterial count per ml** of pasteurized milk.

3.  **[[Coliform Count]]:**
    *   Checks for post-pasteurization contamination.
    *   Standard: Coliforms should be **absent** in 1 ml of milk.

> *   **S** - Standard Plate Count
> *   **C** - Coliform Count

### Pasteurization vs. Boiling of Milk

| Feature | **Pasteurization** | **Boiling** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Temperature** | 63°C – 72°C | 100°C |
| **Pathogens** | Kills most pathogens (TB, Q Fever) | Kills all pathogens |
| **Spores** | **Survive** | May be killed (if boiled >5-10 mins) |
| **Nutritional Value** | Preserved (Minimal loss) | Loss of **Vitamin C** and B group |
| **Taste/Flavor** | Unchanged | Altered (Caramelized/Charred) |
| **Protein** | Minimal coagulation (5% Lactalbumin) | Coagulation of Lactalbumin/Lactoglobulin (Scum formation) |
| **Applicability** | Large scale/Commercial | Household/Domestic |

### Clinical & Public Health Relevance
*   **Preventable Diseases:** Proper pasteurization prevents major milk-borne diseases including **[[Tuberculosis]]**, **[[Brucellosis]]** (Undulant fever), **[[Q Fever]]**, Salmonellosis, and Streptococcal infections.
*   **Nutrient Preservation:** Unlike boiling, pasteurization preserves Vitamin C and prevents the precipitation of Calcium and Magnesium phosphates (which are lost in the scum during boiling), making it nutritionally superior for infants.
