# Jefferson Fracture

### Definition
A **Jefferson fracture** is a specific type of burst fracture involving the ring of the [[C1 vertebra]] (Atlas). It typically involves fractures of both the [[anterior arch]] and the [[posterior arch]] of the atlas, causing the lateral masses to spread outward,.

*   **Named after:** Geoffrey Jefferson, a British neurosurgeon who reported cases in 1920.
*   **Classification:** It is considered a burst fracture resulting from vertical compression.

### Mechanism of Injury
The primary mechanism is **axial compression** (axial loading) transmitted through the skull to the cervical spine,.
*   **Force Transmission:** Sudden severe load on the top of the head drives the [[occipital condyles]] downward into the [[lateral masses]] of C1.
*   **Displacement:** The wedge-shaped lateral masses are squeezed between the occipital condyles and the superior articular facets of the [[axis]] (C2), causing them to be driven outward (laterally), bursting the ring.

**Common causes include:**,,
*   Diving into a shallow pool (striking the head on the bottom).
*   A heavy object falling on the vertex of the head.
*   Vehicle accidents where the head strikes the roof.

### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:** The patient primarily presents with pain in the neck and stiffness.
*   **Neurological Status:** Neurological deficit is **rare**. Because the fracture fragments burst *outward*, the [[spinal canal]] actually widens, sparing the spinal cord from compression,,.
*   **Specific Syndrome:** Rarely, if the [[vertebral artery]] is involved/injured in the foramen transversarium, it may result in [[Wallenberg's syndrome]] (lateral medullary syndrome). Features include ipsilateral cranial nerve signs, Horner’s syndrome, and ataxia.

**Clinical Implication:**
> A normal neurological examination does not rule out a Jefferson fracture. A high index of suspicion is required based on the history of axial trauma (e.g., diving accident).

### Investigations

#### 1. Plain X-ray
*   **View:** Open-mouth odontoid view (Anteroposterior).
*   **Findings:** The [[lateral masses]] of C1 are displaced laterally and spread away from the [[odontoid process]] (dens). They may overhang the lateral borders of the C2 body,.

#### 2. CT Scan
*   **Utility:** This is the method of choice/Gold standard. It clearly defines the number of fracture fragments and the integrity of the bony ring,.

#### 3. MRI
*   **Utility:** Essential for evaluating the integrity of the [[transverse ligament of atlas]] and soft tissues.

### Stability and Classification
Stability is determined by the integrity of the **transverse ligament**,.

| Ligament Status | Stability | Pathomechanics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Intact Transverse Ligament** | **Stable** | The lateral masses spread slightly, but the ring is held largely together. |
| **Ruptured Transverse Ligament** | **Unstable** | The lateral masses spread significantly. The C1-C2 complex becomes unstable. |

### Treatment
Treatment depends heavily on whether the fracture is stable or unstable,,.

#### 1. Stable Injury
*   **Indication:** Transverse ligament is intact; minimal displacement.
*   **Method:** Conservative management.
    *   Immobilization in a rigid cervical collar (e.g., [[Philadelphia collar]]) or [[Minerva jacket]].
    *   Halo-vest immobilization for 8–12 weeks is also an option,.

#### 2. Unstable Injury
*   **Indication:** Ruptured transverse ligament; significant spread of lateral masses.
*   **Method:**
    *   **Halo-vest:** Immobilization in a halo-vest for 8–12 weeks (if reduction is maintained).
    *   **Surgery:** If unstable or if conservative management fails, posterior fusion of C1-C2 or C1-C3 (occipitocervical fusion) may be required,.
