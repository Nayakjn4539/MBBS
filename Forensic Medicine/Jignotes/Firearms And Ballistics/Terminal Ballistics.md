# [[Firearms And Ballistics]] > Terminal Ballistics

### Terminal Ballistics (Wound Ballistics)

**Terminal Ballistics**, also known as **Wound Ballistics**, is the study of the effects of a projectile (bullet or missile) on the target (human body) and the behavior of the projectile within the body. It is the medical aspect of ballistics essential for the [[Forensic Pathologist]] to interpret gunshot injuries.

### Mechanism of Wound Production
The severity of a firearm injury depends on the energy transferred from the missile to the tissues.

**1. Kinetic Energy (KE)**
*   The damaging capacity is governed by the formula: **$KE = 1/2 MV^2$**
    *   $M$ = Mass of the bullet.
    *   $V$ = Velocity of the bullet.
*   **Velocity** is the most critical factor. Doubling the mass doubles the energy, but doubling the velocity quadruples the energy. High-velocity missiles cause significantly more destruction than low-velocity ones.

**2. Cavitation**
*   **Permanent Cavity:** The actual track or path crushed and destroyed by the bullet as it passes through tissues.
*   **Temporary Cavity:** A phenomenon where kinetic energy is transferred to surrounding tissues, causing them to be thrown radially outward (blast effect). This creates a cavity much larger than the bullet diameter, which pulsates and collapses, causing damage to structures (nerves, blood vessels) distant from the actual track.

**3. Yawing and Tumbling**
*   **Yaw:** The deviation of the bullet from its longitudinal axis (wobbling).
*   **Tumble:** The rotation of the bullet end-over-end.
*   Both increase the surface area of impact, leading to greater energy transfer and larger wounds.

### Classification of Firearm Wounds (Range of Fire)
The appearance of the entrance wound varies significantly based on the distance between the muzzle and the target.

#### 1. Contact Shots (Muzzle touching the skin)
*   **Tight Contact (Hard Contact):**
    *   **Muzzle Impression:** An abrasion caused by the heated muzzle rim pressing against the skin and gas expansion lifting the skin against it.
    *   **Shape:** Often **stellate, cruciate, or ragged** (especially over bone like the forehead) due to gases expanding between the skin and bone, causing the skin to burst outwards (blowback effect).
    *   **Color:** The wound track may appear **cherry-red/pink** due to Carbon Monoxide (CO) absorption from discharge gases combining with hemoglobin/myoglobin.
    *   **Residue:** Soot and powder are driven *into* the wound track, not on the surrounding skin.
*   **Loose Contact:**
    *   Muzzle is incompletely touching the skin.
    *   Soot/blackening is deposited on the skin *around* the wound.

#### 2. Close Range (Near Shot)
*   Distance: Within the range of flame and smoke (approx. up to 15-30 cm).
*   **Burning/Scorching:** Flame causes singeing of hair and burning of skin.
*   **Blackening (Smudging/Sooting):** Deposition of smoke (carbon). **Can be wiped off.**
*   **Tattooing (Stippling/Peppering):** Unburnt powder granules embed into the dermis. **Cannot be wiped off**. This is an antemortem phenomenon (vital reaction).

#### 3. Intermediate Range
*   Distance: Outside the range of flame/smoke but within the range of unburnt powder (approx. up to 60-90 cm).
*   **Feature:** **Tattooing (Stippling)** is present around the hole.
*   **Absent:** No burning or blackening.

#### 4. Distant Range
*   Distance: Beyond the range of powder deposition (usually > 1 yard).
*   **Feature:** Only the bullet hole and mechanical effects are seen.
*   **Absent:** No burning, blackening, or tattooing.
*   **Key Findings:** [[Abrasion Collar]] and [[Grease Collar]].

> *   **F**lame (Burning) - Very Close
> *   **S**moke (Blackening) - Close
> *   **T**attooing (Gunpowder) - Intermediate

### General Characteristics of Entry vs. Exit Wounds

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Schematic drawing comparing Entry Wound (inverted edges, abrasion collar) vs. Exit Wound (everted edges, no collar)

| Feature | [[Entrance Wound]] | [[Exit Wound]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Size** | Generally smaller than the bullet (due to skin elasticity). | Usually larger and more irregular/ragged. |
| **Edges** | **Inverted** (turned in). | **Everted** (turned out/puckered). |
| **Abrasion Collar** | **Present.** Reddish-brown rim of abraded skin caused by bullet friction. | **Absent** (Usually). |
| **Grease Collar** | **Present.** Dirt/lubricant wiped off the bullet (Bullet wipe). | **Absent.** |
| **Powder Residue** | Present in contact/close/intermediate shots. | Absent (unless powder travels through the track—rare). |
| **Fat Protrusion** | No protrusion. | Subcutaneous fat may protrude. |
| **Bleeding** | Less bleeding. | More bleeding. |
| **Tissue Color** | May be pink/cherry red (CO effect) in contact shots. | No specific color change. |

### Important Specific Phenomena

**1. Shored Exit Wound:**
*   **Definition:** An exit wound that occurs when the skin at the exit site is supported by a hard object (e.g., belt, wall, floor, tight clothing).
*   **Appearance:** The skin is slapped against the supporting object, causing an **abrasion collar**. This creates confusion as it mimics an entrance wound.

**2. Kennedy Phenomenon:**
*   Surgical alteration or suturing of a gunshot wound by medical personnel during treatment, making it difficult to distinguish between entry and exit wounds at autopsy.

**3. Ricochet Bullet:**
*   A bullet that strikes an intermediate object (wall, ground) before hitting the victim.
*   **Effect:** The bullet deforms and tumbles. The entry wound is large, irregular, and lacks an abrasion collar.

**4. Beveling of Skull (Cranial Ballistics):**
*   **Entry Wound:** Internal beveling (Outer table is punched out cleanly, inner table is shattered in a cone shape).
*   **Exit Wound:** External beveling (Inner table is punched out, outer table is shattered).
*   **Keyhole Defect:** Caused by a tangential shot grazing the skull, showing characteristics of both entry and exit.

**5. Rayalaseema Phenomenon:**
*   In specific regions (like Rayalaseema), victims of homicidal gunshot wounds may have the wounds enlarged or altered artificially to simulate larger weapons or confuse investigators. *(Note: This is a specific observation found in Indian contexts).*

### Special Bullets and Artifacts

*   **Dum-Dum Bullet:** A soft-point or hollow-point bullet designed to expand ("mushroom") upon impact, causing massive tissue destruction and large exit wounds.
*   **Tandem Bullet (Piggyback):** Two bullets entering the body one after another. Occurs when the first bullet gets stuck in the barrel and is pushed out by the second fired bullet.
*   **Souvenir Bullet:** A bullet retained in the body from an old injury, densely encapsulated by fibrous tissue.
*   **Frangible Bullet:** Designed to fragment upon impact to transfer maximum energy and reduce over-penetration.

### Medicolegal Aspects & Autopsy Protocol

1.  **X-rays:** Mandatory before autopsy to locate the bullet, estimate caliber, and identify fragments.
2.  **Preservation of Evidence:**
    *   **Skin:** Excise skin around entry and exit wounds (preserve in rectified spirit/formalin) for chemical analysis of residues.
    *   **Bullet:** Recover with fingers or rubber-tipped forceps to avoid scratching rifling marks. Do not wash the bullet. Mark it on the base (not the nose).
    *   **Clothes:** Air dry and pack in paper bags (not plastic) to preserve Gunshot Residue (GSR).
3.  **Determination of Manner:**
    *   **Suicide:** Contact/close range, accessible site (temple, mouth, precordium), cadaveric spasm (gun in hand).
    *   **Homicide:** Distant range, inaccessible sites (back), defense wounds, multiple shots.
