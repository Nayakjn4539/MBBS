# [[Regional Injuries]] > Road Traffic Accidents

### Road Traffic Accidents (RTA)

Injuries sustained in [[Road Traffic Accidents]] vary depending on the category of the victim (Pedestrian, Driver, or Passenger), the type of vehicle, speed, and nature of the impact.

---

### 1. Pedestrian Injuries
Pedestrians are the most vulnerable road users. Injuries usually occur in three distinct phases:

#### A. Primary Impact Injuries
These are caused by the initial contact between the vehicle and the pedestrian.
*   **Site:** Usually the legs or hips (depending on the height of the bumper and the victim).
*   **Bumper Fracture:** A fracture of the tibia and fibula caused by the bumper.
    *   **Measurement:** The height of the fracture from the heel must be measured to identify the type of vehicle (e.g., car vs. truck).
    *   **Wedge Shape:** A triangular fragment of bone (wedge) is often formed. The **base** of the triangle indicates the site of impact, and the **apex** points in the direction the bone was pushed.
*   **Imprint Abrasions:** Patterned abrasions reflecting the radiator grille or headlamp design may be seen on the thighs or hips.

#### B. Secondary Impact Injuries
These occur when the pedestrian is thrown onto the vehicle (bonnet/hood or windscreen) after the primary impact.
*   **Scoop-up Effect:** If the center of gravity of the victim is *above* the point of impact (common in adults hit by cars), the victim is scooped up onto the bonnet.
*   **Injuries:**
    *   **Head:** Impact against the windscreen or A-pillars.
    *   **Chest/Abdomen:** Impact against the bonnet/hood.
    *   **Glass Injuries:** **[[Sparrow Foot Marks]]** are multiple, small, angular, superficial incised wounds caused by tempered glass fragments from the windscreen.

#### C. Secondary Injuries (Tertiary Impact)
These occur when the victim falls off the vehicle and strikes the ground.
*   **Mechanism:** The victim is "thrown clear" of the vehicle.
*   **Injuries:**
    *   **Head:** Severe [[Craniocerebral Injuries]] (fractures, subdural hematoma, coup/contrecoup injuries). This is the most common cause of death.
    *   **Skin:** Extensive grazing (brush burns) due to sliding on the road surface.
    *   **Spine:** Fractures due to hyperflexion or hyperextension upon landing.

#### D. Run-Over Injuries
Occur when the wheels of a vehicle pass over the body.
*   **Tire Marks:** Patterned [[Intradermal Bruises]] or abrasions reflecting the tire tread.
*   **Degloving/Avulsion:** The rotary movement of the wheel can shear skin and subcutaneous tissue from the underlying muscle (flaying).
*   **Core Crush:** Rib fractures, flail chest, and rupture of solid organs (liver, spleen) due to massive compression.
*   **Tare-burns:** Friction burns caused by a spinning tire against stationary skin.

> **Mnemonic for Pedestrian Phases:** **P-S-S-R**
> *   **P**rimary (Bumper hits legs)
> *   **S**econdary (Body hits bonnet)
> *   **S**econdary/Tertiary (Body hits ground)
> *   **R**un-over (Wheel goes over body)

### 2. Driver Injuries (Occupant)
Drivers sustain injuries from interaction with the interior of the vehicle during deceleration.

#### A. Steering Wheel Injuries
*   **Mechanism:** Direct impact of the chest/abdomen against the steering wheel assembly.
*   **Chest:** Transverse fracture of the sternum, [[Flail Chest]], cardiac contusion, and traumatic rupture of the **[[Aorta]]** (typically at the isthmus/arch due to shear forces).
*   **Abdomen:** Rupture of the liver (right lobe) or spleen.
*   **Hands:** Fracture of wrists, metacarpals, or forearms if the driver was gripping the wheel tightly at impact (anticipatory bracing).

#### B. Dashboard Injuries
*   **Mechanism:** Forward movement of the knees against the dashboard.
*   **Skeletal:** Fracture of the patella, femur, or posterior **[[Dislocation of Hip]]** joint (force transmitted from the knee to the hip).

#### C. Windscreen Injuries
*   **Face/Head:** Lacerations on the forehead and face (often vertical) as the head strikes the glass.
*   **Whiplash Injury:**
    *   Occurs in rear-end collisions.
    *   **Mechanism:** Sudden hyperextension followed by hyperflexion of the neck.
    *   **Pathology:** Tear of the anterior longitudinal ligament, intervertebral disc herniation (usually C5-C6), and potential cervical spine fracture/dislocation.

### 3. Passenger Injuries (Occupant)
*   **Front Seat Passenger:**
    *   Similar to the driver but lacks steering wheel injuries.
    *   **Ejection:** Higher risk of being ejected through the windscreen (if unrestrained), leading to severe head injuries.
    *   **Dashboard:** Severe facial injuries (hitting the dashboard) and knee/femur injuries similar to the driver.
*   **Rear Seat Passenger:**
    *   Usually sustain fewer injuries unless unrestrained.
    *   May be thrown forward into the front seats, causing injury to themselves and front-seat occupants.

### 4. Restraint System Injuries
While seat belts and airbags save lives, they can cause specific injury patterns.

| Restraint Type | Injury Pattern |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Seat Belt (Lap belt)** | **[[Chance Fracture]]:** Horizontal splitting fracture of the lumbar vertebra due to acute flexion-distraction.<br>**Mesenteric Tears:** Compression of bowel against the spine. |
| **Seat Belt (Shoulder)** | Linear diagonal bruises (Patterned contusion) across the chest and neck.<br>Fracture of the clavicle or sternum. |
| **Airbags** | Facial abrasions ("bag slap"), corneal abrasions, chemical burns from sodium azide propellant, fracture of upper extremities. |

### 5. Motorcyclist Injuries
*   **Primary/Secondary Impact:** Similar to pedestrians but at higher velocities.
*   **Tail-gating:** Abrasions on the inner aspect of the knees/calves from gripping the fuel tank during a crash.
*   **Head Injuries:**
    *   **[[Ring Fracture]]:** A fracture around the foramen magnum caused by the spine being forced into the skull base (from landing on feet/buttocks) or the skull being forced down onto the spine (vertex impact).
    *   **Hinge Fracture (Motorcyclist's Fracture):** Transverse fracture across the base of the skull (middle cranial fossa), typically separating the anterior and posterior halves of the base.
*   **Defense Injuries:** Abrasions on the dorsum of hands/forearms from sliding on the road.

### Autopsy Findings in RTA

**1. External Examination**
*   **Clothing:** Examine for grease, paint flakes (trace evidence), tire marks, and direction of tears (indicates direction of force).
*   **Glass:** Look for fragments in hair and wounds (preserve for analysis).
*   **Patterned Injuries:** Measure height of bumper fractures from the heel. Photograph tire marks with a scale.

**2. Internal Examination**
*   **Thorax:** Look for aortic rupture (clean transaction), rib fractures (CPR artifacts vs. trauma), and hemothorax.
*   **Abdomen:** Check liver, spleen, and mesentery. Look for "seat belt syndrome" (bowel perforation).
*   **Head:** Reflect scalp to check for subcutaneous hematomas which may not be visible externally. Check for Duret hemorrhages in the brainstem (secondary to high intracranial pressure).
*   **Legs:** Dissect the calves and back of legs to look for deep bruising not visible on the skin (bumper impact evidence).

**3. Toxicology**
*   Routine screening for **[[Alcohol]]** (Blood and Urine/Vitreous Humor) and drugs is mandatory for all drivers and pedestrians in fatal accidents.

### Medicolegal Aspects
1.  **Cause of Death:** Usually craniocerebral damage, hemorrhage (shock), or injury to vital organs.
2.  **Manner of Death:** Mostly **Accidental**. Suicide is less common (walking into traffic). Homicide is rare but possible (running someone over intentionally).
3.  **Hit and Run:** Trace evidence (paint, glass, grease) found on the victim's body/clothes helps link the specific vehicle to the crime.
4.  **Reconstruction:** The pattern of injuries helps determine the position of the victim (standing, lying, walking) and the direction of the vehicle at the time of impact.
5.  **Driver vs. Passenger:** In fatal cases where occupants are ejected, pattern analysis (e.g., steering wheel imprint on chest = driver) helps identify who was driving.
