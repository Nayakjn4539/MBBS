# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Modified plan of action for malaria control

# Modified Plan of Operation (MPO) for Malaria Control (1977)

The **Modified Plan of Operation (MPO)** was introduced in India in **1977** following the resurgence of malaria cases (6.46 million cases in 1976) and the realization that total eradication was not immediately feasible due to technical, administrative, and operational constraints.

The philosophy shifted from **Eradication** (ending transmission completely) to **Control** (reducing burden to a level where it is not a public health problem).

### 1. Objectives of MPO
The immediate objectives set out in 1977 were:
1.  **Prevention of deaths** due to Malaria.
2.  **Reduction of morbidity** (sickness) due to Malaria.
3.  **Maintenance of agricultural and industrial production** (by keeping the workforce healthy).
4.  **Consolidation of achievements** attained so far.

### 2. Strategy: Stratification of Areas
Under the MPO, a **3-pronged strategy** was adopted. The most distinct feature was the **stratification of rural areas based on the [[Annual Parasite Incidence]] (API)** to ensure rational use of resources.

#### A. Areas with API $\ge$ 2 (High Risk Areas)
These are areas where the number of confirmed cases is 2 or more per 1,000 population.
*   **Vector Control:** Regular [[Indoor Residual Spray]] (IRS) is mandatory.
    *   **Non-refractory to DDT:** Spray [[DDT]] (1.0 g/m²) – **2 rounds**.
    *   **Refractory to DDT:** Spray [[Malathion]] (2.0 g/m²) – **3 rounds**.
    *   **Refractory to Malathion:** Spray [[Synthetic Pyrethroids]] (0.25 g/m²) – **2 rounds**.
*   **Surveillance:** Continued active and passive surveillance.
*   **Treatment:** Decentralization of laboratory services to the [[Primary Health Centre]] (PHC) level.
*   **Drug Distribution:** Establishment of **[[Drug Distribution Centers]] (DDCs)** and **[[Fever Treatment Depots]] (FTDs)** for easy access to chloroquine.

#### B. Areas with API < 2 (Low Risk Areas)
These are areas with fewer than 2 cases per 1,000 population.
*   **Vector Control:** **Focal Spray** only. Insecticides (DDT/BHC/Malathion) are sprayed only around the house where a *Plasmodium falciparum* (Pf) case is detected to contain the focus.
*   **Surveillance:** Vigilance through active and passive surveillance to detect any rise in cases.
*   **Treatment:** 
    *   **Presumptive treatment** given to all suspected fever cases.
    *   **Radical treatment** ensured for those found positive on blood smear.
*   **Investigation:** Epidemiological investigation of positive cases to trace the source.

### 3. Key Components of MPO Implementation

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Approach Shift** | Vertical approach (standalone malaria staff) was replaced by a **Horizontal approach** (integrated with General Health Services). |
| **Case Detection** | **Active Surveillance:** [[Multipurpose Worker]] (MPW) visits houses fortnightly to collect slides.<br>**Passive Surveillance:** Patients reporting fever at clinics/hospitals. |
| **Treatment Network** | Involvement of community volunteers:<br>**[[Fever Treatment Depots]] (FTDs):** Collect slides *and* give drugs.<br>**[[Drug Distribution Centers]] (DDCs):** Only give presumptive drugs (Chloroquine). |
| **Urban Strategy** | The [[Urban Malaria Scheme]] (1971) continued under MPO, focusing on **anti-larval measures** (biological control with fish, chemical larvicides) rather than IRS, due to the habits of *[[Anopheles stephensi]]*. |
| **Pf Containment** | Special efforts (Pf Containment Program) launched in 1977 to tackle *P. falciparum* resistance and spread. |

### 4. Mnemonics

**To remember the Objectives of MPO:**
> **"D-MAC"**
*   **D** - **D**eath prevention
*   **M** - **M**orbidity reduction
*   **A** - **A**gricultural/Industrial maintenance
*   **C** - **C**onsolidation of gains

**To remember Spray Rounds:**
> **"D-2, M-3"**
*   **D**DT needs **2** rounds.
*   **M**alathion needs **3** rounds (it has a shorter residual effect).

### 5. Clinical Relevance
*   **Notification:** Under MPO strategies, private practitioners and clinics play a vital role in **Passive Surveillance**. Every fever case must be investigated for malaria.
*   **Drug Resistance:** The MPO recognized the rise of drug-resistant malaria. Clinicians must be aware that in areas where MPO strategies (like DDT spray) failed due to resistance, the clinical management protocols (use of ACT vs Chloroquine) also change.
*   **Severe Malaria:** The MPO emphasized preventing mortality; hence, a clinician's priority is the early identification of *[[Severe Malaria]]* signs (coma, acidosis, severe anemia) and prompt referral.
