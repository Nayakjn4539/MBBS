# Congenital Defects of the Uvea

The [[Uveal Tract]] (Iris, Ciliary Body, and Choroid) is developmentally derived primarily from the **Neural Crest Cells** (stroma) and **Neuroectoderm** (pigment epithelium). Congenital anomalies can affect one or all parts of the uvea.

## 1. Congenital Anomalies of the Iris

### A. Aniridia (Iridemia)
*   **Definition:** A condition denoting the absence of the [[Iris]]. True aniridia (complete absence) is extremely rare; clinically, a rudimentary peripheral stump of the iris is usually present (Clinical Aniridia).
*   **Genetics:**
    *   Usually bilateral and familial (Autosomal Dominant).
    *   Sporadic cases may be associated with chromosomal deletions (11p13).
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Iris appears absent on external examination.
    *   **Ciliary processes** and **Zonules** of the lens are often visible.
    *   **Photophobia** due to lack of light regulation.
    *   **Nystagmus** and foveal hypoplasia (poor vision).
*   **Associations (Phenotypes):**
    1.  **AN-1:** Normal vision (AD inheritance).
    2.  **AN-2:** Poor vision due to foveal hypoplasia (AD inheritance).
    3.  **WAGR Syndrome (Sporadic):** **W**ilms' tumor (Nephroblastoma), **A**niridia, **G**enitourinary anomalies, **R**etardation.
    4.  **Autosomal Recessive:** Associated with mental retardation.
*   **Clinical Implication:** High risk of [[Secondary Glaucoma]] due to angle anomalies and [[Cataract]].

### B. Coloboma of the Iris
*   **Definition:** A notch-shaped defect or absence of tissue in the iris.
*   **Types:**
    1.  **Typical Coloboma:**
        *   **Location:** **Inferonasal quadrant**.
        *   **Cause:** Defective closure of the **embryonic fissure** (choroidal fissure).
        *   **Appearance:** "Pear-shaped" or "Key-hole" pupil.
        *   **Extent:** Can be **Complete** (extending from pupil to optic nerve) or **Incomplete** (involving only iris or stopping short of the nerve).
    2.  **Atypical Coloboma:**
        *   **Location:** Any other quadrant.
        *   **Cause:** Not due to non-closure of the choroidal fissure.
*   **Clinical Implication:** May be associated with coloboma of the ciliary body, choroid, retina, and lens (causing a notch in the lens).

### C. Persistent Pupillary Membrane (PPM)
*   **Pathology:** Remnants of the **anterior vascular sheath** of the lens (Tunica Vasculosa Lentis) which normally disappears before birth.
*   **Appearance:**
    *   Fine threads or stellate-shaped shreds of pigmented tissue.
    *   Originates from the **Collarette** (Circulus Iridis Minor).
    *   May float freely in the [[Anterior Chamber]] or attach to the anterior lens capsule.
    *   **Epicapsular Stars:** Minute brown dots on the anterior lens capsule (pigment remnants).
*   **Clinical Significance:** Usually does not interfere with vision, unlike pathological posterior synechiae which arise from the pupillary margin.

### D. Heterochromia of the Iris
*   **Definition:** Variations in iris color.
*   **Types:**
    1.  **Heterochromia Iridium:** Different color between the two eyes (one blue, one brown).
    2.  **Heterochromia Iridis:** A sector of one iris differs in color from the remainder.
*   **Etiology:**
    *   **Hypochromic (Lighter):** Congenital [[Horner's Syndrome]] (due to lack of sympathetic stimulation to melanocytes), Waardenburg syndrome.
    *   **Hyperchromic (Darker):** Ocular melanocytosis, Siderosis, Malignant melanoma.

### E. Anomalies of Pupil Position and Number
| Anomaly | Definition | Clinical Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Corectopia** | Abnormally eccentric position of the pupil | Normal pupil is slightly nasal to center. |
| **Polycoria** | Multiple pupils | True polycoria has a sphincter muscle; **Pseudopolycoria** does not. |
| **Dyscoria** | Abnormal shape of the pupil | Associated with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome. |

### F. Congenital Ectropion Uveae
*   **Definition:** Presence of iris pigment epithelium on the anterior surface of the iris.
*   **Association:** Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF-1), Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome.
*   **Clinical Implication:** Often associated with secondary glaucoma.

## 2. Congenital Anomalies of the Ciliary Body

*   **Coloboma of Ciliary Body:** Usually associated with typical iris and choroidal coloboma (Inferonasal).
*   **Structural Anomalies:** Associated with anterior segment dysgenesis (e.g., Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome).

---

## 3. Congenital Anomalies of the Choroid

### A. Coloboma of the Choroid
*   **Appearance:** Oval or comet-shaped large whitish excavation (sclera visible) in the fundus.
*   **Location:** Typically **Inferonasal** (Typical Coloboma).
*   **Pathology:** Defective closure of the embryonic fissure. The retina is also absent or rudimentary over the defect.
*   **Visual Field:** Causes a superior visual field defect corresponding to the inferior lesion.
*   **Clinical Implication:** High risk of [[Retinal Detachment]] (Rhegmatogenous) at the edges of the coloboma.

### B. Albinism
*   **Definition:** Hereditary defective development of pigment throughout the body or eye.
*   **Types:**
    1.  **Oculocutaneous:** Affects eyes, skin, and hair.
    2.  **Ocular:** Pigment absence limited to choroid and retina (Iris may be blue).
*   **Ocular Features:**
    *   **Iris:** Pink/Blue, translucent (transillumination defects).
    *   **Fundus:** Orange/Red reflex; choroidal vessels are seen with great clarity against white sclera due to lack of RPE pigment.
    *   **Foveal Hypoplasia:** Leads to poor vision and nystagmus.
    *   **Photophobia:** Due to scattering of light.

## 4. Anomalies Associated with Anterior Segment Dysgenesis

These are developmental disorders affecting the neural crest-derived tissues of the anterior segment.

| Syndrome | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Axenfeld-Rieger Anomaly** | **Posterior Embryotoxon** (prominent Schwalbe’s line) + Iris strands attached to it. <br> **Rieger’s:** Above + Iris hypoplasia, corectopia, polycoria. |
| **Peter’s Anomaly** | Central [[Corneal Opacity]] with iris adhesions to the margins (Iridocorneal adhesions). |

## 5. Cystic Lesions

*   **Congenital Cysts:**
    *   Can occur in the iris stroma.
    *   **Pearl Cysts:** Implantation of epithelium (usually acquired/traumatic but can be congenital).

---

### Mnemonics

*   **WAGR:** **W**ilms Tumor, **A**niridia, **G**enitourinary anomalies, **R**etardation (Mental).
*   **HIMAPLE:** Features of [[Horner's Syndrome]] (includes **H**eterochromia Iridis - congenital type).
