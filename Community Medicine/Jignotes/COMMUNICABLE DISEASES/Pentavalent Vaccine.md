# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Pentavalent Vaccine

# [[Pentavalent Vaccine]]

### 1. Introduction and Components
The **Pentavalent Vaccine** is a combination vaccine used in the [[Universal Immunization Programme]] (UIP) that provides protection against **five** life-threatening diseases in a single shot. It has replaced the DPT and Hepatitis B vaccines for the primary vaccination schedule at 6, 10, and 14 weeks.

**The "Five" Components:**
1.  **D**iphtheria (Toxoid)
2.  **P**ertussis (Whole cell killed bacteria)
3.  **T**etanus (Toxoid)
4.  **H**epatitis B (Recombinant)
5.  **H**aemophilus influenzae type b ([[Hib]]) (Conjugate)

### 2. Schedule and Administration
The vaccine comes as a **fully liquid formulation** (no reconstitution required).

| Feature | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Dose** | 0.5 ml |
| **Route** | Intramuscular ([[IM]]) |
| **Site** | **Antero-lateral aspect of the mid-thigh** (Left side is preferred to distinguish from PCV/IPV sites) |
| **Schedule** | 3 Primary doses at **6 weeks**, **10 weeks**, and **14 weeks** |
| **Syringe** | Auto-disabled (AD) syringe |

**Note on Schedule:**
*   The Pentavalent vaccine replaces the primary DPT and Hepatitis B doses at 6, 10, and 14 weeks.
*   However, the **Hepatitis B birth dose** (within 24 hours) and **DPT boosters** (at 16-24 months and 5-6 years) are *still continued* as separate vaccines.

### 3. Storage and Cold Chain
*   **Temperature:** Must be stored between **+2°C to +8°C** in the [[Ice Lined Refrigerator]] (ILR).
*   **Placement:** It should be kept in the basket (upper part) of the ILR, *never* on the floor.
*   **Freeze Sensitivity:** It is a **Freeze Sensitive** vaccine.
    *   If frozen, the Aluminium hydroxide adjuvant precipitates and damages the vaccine potency.
    *   **[[Shake Test]]** is mandatory if freezing is suspected. If the vial fails the Shake Test (sedimentation is faster than control), it must be discarded.
*   **[[Open Vial Policy]]:** Pentavalent vaccine falls under the "Open Vial Policy." Opened vials can be used for up to **28 days** provided the expiry date has not passed, the [[Vaccine Vial Monitor]] (VVM) is valid, and cold chain has been maintained.

### 4. Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI)
Pentavalent vaccine is generally safe, but side effects can occur:
*   **Minor Reactions:** Pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site; mild fever, vomiting, loss of appetite, and irritability.
*   **Inconsolable Crying:** Persistent crying (>3 hours) may occur, usually attributed to the **Pertussis** (whole cell) component.
*   **Rare/Severe:** High fever (>39.5°C), seizures (fits), or anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction).
*   **Clustering:** Sterile abscesses may occur if the vial contains precipitate (due to freezing) or due to improper injection technique.

### 5. Advantages
*   **Reduces Pricks:** Reduces the number of injections a child receives from 9 to 3 for these antigens, increasing comfort and compliance.
*   **Operational Efficiency:** Simplifies logistics and storage space requirements compared to storing separate antigens.
*   **Hib Coverage:** Ensures protection against Hib meningitis and pneumonia, which were previously not covered universally.

### 6. Contraindications
*   History of severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a previous dose or any vaccine component.
*   Child with severe acute illness or high fever (vaccination should be postponed).
*   Evolving neurological conditions (due to the Pertussis component).
