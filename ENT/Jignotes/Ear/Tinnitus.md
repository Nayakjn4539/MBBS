# Tinnitus

### Definition
[[Tinnitus]] is defined as the perception of sound in the ear or head in the absence of any external acoustic stimulus. It is derived from the Latin word *tinnire*, meaning "to ring". It is a symptom, not a disease entity itself.

### Classification
Tinnitus is broadly classified based on source and audibility to the examiner.

| Classification | Description | Common Causes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Subjective Tinnitus** | Perceived *only* by the patient. Most common type. | [[Presbycusis]], [[Ménière's disease]], [[Otosclerosis]], [[Acoustic neuroma]], [[Noise-induced hearing loss]]. |
| **Objective Tinnitus** | Can be heard by both the patient and the examiner (using a stethoscope or unaided). Rare (1%). | [[Glomus tumours]], [[Palatal myoclonus]], AV malformations, [[Patulous Eustachian tube]]. |

**Other Classifications:**
*   **Pulsatile vs. Non-pulsatile:** Pulsatile is synchronous with the heartbeat (vascular origin); Non-pulsatile is continuous.
*   **Compensated vs. Decompensated:** Based on the psychological impact and annoyance.

### Etiology (Causes)

#### 1. Subjective Tinnitus
This can be due to otologic or non-otologic causes.

**A. Otologic Causes:**
*   **External Ear:** Impacted [[Cerumen]] (wax), [[Foreign body]], [[Otitis externa]].
*   **Middle Ear:**
    *   [[Acute otitis media]] / [[Chronic otitis media]] (CSOM).
    *   Fluid in the middle ear ([[Serous otitis media]]).
    *   [[Otosclerosis]] (fixation of stapes).
    *   Ossicular discontinuity.
*   **Inner Ear (Cochlear):**
    *   [[Ménière's disease]] (roaring, low-pitched tinnitus).
    *   [[Presbycusis]] (sensorineural hearing loss of aging).
    *   [[Noise-induced hearing loss]] (acoustic trauma).
    *   Labyrinthitis.
*   **Retrocochlear (Neural):**
    *   [[Acoustic neuroma]] (Vestibular Schwannoma).
    *   [[Vestibular neuritis]].

**B. Non-Otologic Causes:**
*   **Metabolic:** [[Hypothyroidism]] or Hyperthyroidism, [[Anemia]], Vitamin B12/Zinc deficiency, Hyperlipidemia.
*   **Pharmacologic (Ototoxicity):**
    *   Salicylates (Aspirin).
    *   Aminoglycosides (Streptomycin, Gentamicin).
    *   Loop diuretics (Furosemide).
    *   Quinine.
    *   Cisplatin (Cytotoxic drugs).
*   **Neurologic:** Head injury (labyrinthine concussion), Multiple sclerosis, Temporal bone fractures.
*   **Psychogenic:** Anxiety, depression, stress.
*   **Cardiovascular:** Hypertension, hypotension.

#### 2. Objective Tinnitus
These sounds are generated within the body and conducted to the ear.

*   **Vascular (Pulsatile):**
    *   **Glomus Tumours:** [[Glomus tympanicum]] or [[Glomus jugulare]] (highly vascular).
    *   **Arteriovenous Malformations (AVM).**
    *   **Venous Hum:** Dehiscent jugular bulb, high-riding jugular bulb.
    *   **Arterial Bruit:** Carotid artery stenosis, aneurysm, persistent stapedial artery.
    *   **Benign Intracranial Hypertension.**
*   **Muscular/Neuromuscular (Clicking/Fluttering):**
    *   **[[Palatal Myoclonus]]:** Rhythmic contraction of soft palate muscles.
    *   **Middle Ear Myoclonus:** Rhythmic contraction of [[Tensor tympani]] or [[Stapedius]] muscles.
*   **Respiratory (Blowing):**
    *   **[[Patulous Eustachian Tube]]:** Tinnitus synchronous with respiration (Autophony).

### Pathophysiology
*   **Subjective:** The exact mechanism is debated.
    *   **Jastreboff's Neurophysiological Model:** Suggests a processing disorder where the auditory signal is reinforced by the limbic (emotion) and autonomic nervous systems, preventing habituation.
    *   **Neural Plasticity:** Deprivation of auditory input (hearing loss) leads to central reorganization and "phantom" neural activity interpreted as sound.
    *   **Hair Cell Damage:** Loss of outer hair cells leads to a loss of inhibition and increased spontaneous firing of auditory neurons.
*   **Objective:** Mechanical generation of sound (turbulence of blood flow or muscle clonus) conducted through bone or air to the cochlea.

### Clinical Evaluation

#### 1. History
*   **Character:** Ringing/buzzing (SNHL), roaring (Ménière’s), clicking (myoclonus), pulsatile (vascular).
*   **Laterality:** **Unilateral tinnitus is a red flag** for [[Acoustic neuroma]].
*   **Association:**
    *   With [[Vertigo]]: Ménière’s disease.
    *   With Hearing Loss: Presbycusis, NIHL.
    *   With Autophony: Patulous Eustachian tube.
*   **Aggravating Factors:** Stress, silence, stimulants (coffee/tea).
*   **Drug History:** Recent intake of ototoxic drugs.

#### 2. Physical Examination
*   **Otoscopy:** Rule out wax, fluid, or perforation.
    *   **Red Reflex/Rising Sun Sign:** Suggests [[Glomus tumour]] behind the TM.
    *   **Brown's Sign:** Blanching of mass on pneumatic pressure (Glomus).
*   **Auscultation:** Over the mastoid, neck, and orbit for bruits (Objective tinnitus).
*   **Neurological Exam:** Cranial nerves V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII (Jugular foramen syndrome).
*   **Neck Exam:** Compression of jugular vein may stop venous hums.

### Investigations

**A. Audiological Tests**
1.  **[[Pure Tone Audiometry]] (PTA):** To assess type and degree of hearing loss. High-frequency loss is common in acoustic trauma/presbycusis; low-frequency in Ménière’s.
2.  **[[Tinnitus Matching]]:** Determines the frequency (pitch) and intensity (loudness) of the tinnitus.
3.  **[[Impedance Audiometry]]:**
    *   **Tympanometry:** Detects middle ear pathology (e.g., fluid).
    *   **Stapedial Reflex:** Decay positive in retrocochlear lesions.
    *   Rhythmic changes in compliance seen in palatal myoclonus.
4.  **Speech Audiometry:** Poor discrimination scores in retrocochlear lesions.
5.  **[[Otoacoustic Emissions]] (OAE):** To assess outer hair cell function.

**B. Laboratory Tests**
*   Hemogram (Anemia), Thyroid function tests, Lipid profile, Blood sugar, VDRL (Syphilis).

**C. Imaging**
*   **[[MRI]] with Gadolinium:** Gold standard to rule out **[[Acoustic Neuroma]]** (CP angle tumor) in unilateral tinnitus.
*   **Contrast [[CT Scan]] (HRCT):** For bony pathologies, glomus tumors (Phelps sign), and sigmoid sinus diverticulum.
*   **MR Angiography/Venography:** For vascular malformations.

### Management

Treating the underlying cause is the primary goal (e.g., removing wax, treating hypertension, stapedectomy for otosclerosis, excising glomus tumor).

**Management of Subjective Tinnitus (Where no cause is found):**

1.  **Counselling and Reassurance:**
    *   Explain the benign nature of the condition to reduce anxiety.
    *   Crucial for preventing the "vicious cycle" of stress and tinnitus.

2.  **Sound Therapy (Masking):**
    *   **Tinnitus Maskers:** Wearable devices producing white noise to cover the tinnitus.
    *   **[[Hearing Aids]]:** Amplify ambient noise, which naturally masks tinnitus. Useful if hearing loss is present.
    *   **Tinnitus Instruments:** Combination of hearing aid and masker.
    *   **Home remedies:** Fan, radio, or ticking clock at bedside for sleep.

3.  **[[Tinnitus Retraining Therapy]] (TRT):**
    *   Based on Jastreboff’s model.
    *   Combines **directive counselling** with **low-level sound therapy**.
    *   **Goal:** Habituation (the brain learns to ignore the tinnitus signal). Success rate >80%.

4.  **Pharmacotherapy:**
    *   No FDA-approved drug specifically for tinnitus cure.
    *   **Vasodilators:** [[Betahistine]], Ginkgo biloba (limited evidence).
    *   **Sedatives/Anxiolytics:** Alprazolam, Clonazepam (to break the anxiety cycle).
    *   **Antidepressants:** Tricyclics (Amitriptyline) for associated depression.
    *   **Nutritional Supplements:** Zinc, Vitamin B12 (if deficient).
    *   *Note: IV Lidocaine suppresses tinnitus but is not used clinically due to cardiac risks.*

5.  **Psychological Therapy:**
    *   **[[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy]] (CBT):** To alter the patient's negative reaction to the sound.
    *   Biofeedback and relaxation techniques.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Pulsatile Tinnitus:** Always requires imaging (CT/MRI/Angiography) to rule out vascular tumors (Glomus) or malformations.
*   **Unilateral Tinnitus + SNHL:** Must rule out **Vestibular Schwannoma** until proven otherwise.
*   **Aquino Sign:** Disappearance of tinnitus on carotid compression (seen in Glomus Jugulare).
*   **Objective Tinnitus:** Check for palatal myoclonus (rhythmic movement of the palate).
