# [[Nutrition And Health]] > Carbohydrates and Dietary Fiber

### **Carbohydrates**

Carbohydrates are the third major component of food and the main source of energy for the body. They are often referred to as **[[Proximate Principles]]** along with fats and proteins.

**1. Characteristics & Energy Yield**
*   **Energy Value:** Provides **4 kcal/gram** of energy.
*   **Dietary Contribution:** In a balanced Indian diet, carbohydrates should contribute **50–70%** (some sources say up to 80%) of total energy intake,.
*   **Reserve:** Stored as **[[Glycogen]]** in the liver and muscles (about 500g in an adult).

**2. Sources of Carbohydrates**
There are three main sources in the human diet,:
*   **Starches:** Found in abundance in cereals (rice, wheat), roots, and tubers. This is the basic staple of the human diet.
*   **Sugars:** Comprise monosaccharides (glucose, fructose) and disaccharides (sucrose, lactose). These are highly water-soluble and easily assimilated.
*   **Cellulose:** The indigestible component that contributes to dietary fiber.

**3. Functions**
*   **Main source of energy:** Essential for oxidation of fats and synthesis of certain non-essential amino acids.
*   **Sparing Action:** Sufficient carbohydrate intake prevents the breakdown of body proteins for energy (Protein-sparing action).

### **Glycemic Index (GI)**

The **[[Glycemic Index]]** is defined by the area under the two-hour blood glucose response curve (AUC) following the ingestion of a fixed portion of test carbohydrate (usually 50g) compared to a standard (glucose or white bread).

| Classification | GI Range | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Low GI** | $\le$ 55 | Most fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, lentils. |
| **Medium GI** | 56 – 69 | Sucrose, basmati rice, brown rice. |
| **High GI** | $\ge$ 70 | Corn flakes, baked potato, white bread, candy bars. |

> **Clinical Relevance:** Low GI foods release sugar slowly, helping in the management of **[[Diabetes Mellitus]]** and obesity.

### **Dietary Fiber**

**Definition:** Dietary fiber (also known as Non-Starch Polysaccharides or NSP) constitutes the indigestible part of plant foods that is resistant to digestion by human enzymes in the small intestine but undergoes partial or complete fermentation in the large intestine,.

*   **Animal foods** do not contain any fiber.
*   **Recommended Intake:** A daily intake of **40 grams** (or 30g per 2000 kcal) is desirable,.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a pie chart or bar graph showing sources of fiber, distinguishing between soluble (oats, fruits) and insoluble (bran, whole wheat) sources.

#### **Types of Dietary Fiber**

| Type | Components | Sources | Primary Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Insoluble Fiber** | Cellulose, Hemicellulose, Lignin | Wheat bran, roots, tubers, whole grains | Increases stool bulk, prevents constipation,. |
| **Soluble Fiber** | Pectins, Gums, Mucilages | Oats, legumes, fruits, fenugreek | Lowers blood cholesterol and glucose levels,. |

#### **Physiological Functions & Benefits**

1.  **Prevents Constipation:** Fiber holds water and swells, increasing the bulk of the stool and stimulating bowel movement.
2.  **Reduces Cholesterol:** Soluble fiber binds to bile salts, preventing reabsorption and lowering circulation cholesterol levels (reducing **[[Coronary Heart Disease]]** risk).
3.  **Blood Glucose Control:** Reduces post-prandial glucose levels and flattens the glucose tolerance curve. Fenugreek seeds (40% gum) are effective in this regard.
4.  **Cancer Prevention:** Reduces the risk of **[[Colon Cancer]]** by reducing the transit time of stools and diluting carcinogens in the bowel,.
5.  **Weight Control:** Promotes satiety (feeling of fullness), aiding in weight reduction.

**Adverse Effects of Excess:**
Excessive intake (over 60g/day) may reduce the absorption of valuable micronutrients like **calcium, iron, and zinc** due to binding.

### **Mnemonic for Fiber Functions**

**"FIBER"** helps you remember:
*   **F** - **F**ecal bulk increased (Prevents constipation)
*   **I** - **I**nsulin sensitivity improved (Controls Diabetes)
*   **B** - **B**inds Bile salts (Lowers Cholesterol)
*   **E** - **E**liminates Toxins (Prevents Colon Cancer)
*   **R** - **R**educes weight (Satiety)
