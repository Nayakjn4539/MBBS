# [[CONCEPT OF HEALTH & DISEASES]] > What do you mean by indicators of health? Write down the different disability rates with example. What is the concept of disability limitation?

### 1. Indicators of Health

**Definition:**
[[Indicators of Health]] are variables which help to measure changes in the health status of a community. Since health is multidimensional and abstract, it cannot be measured directly (like weight or height). Therefore, indicators are used as a reflection of the health situation. They are essential for comparing the health status of one country with another and for evaluating health care services,,.

**Characteristics of an Ideal Indicator:**
To be useful, an indicator should meet the following criteria (Mnemonic: **VRSS**):
*   **V**alid: It should measure what it is supposed to measure.
*   **R**eliable: It should give the same results if repeated by different people in similar circumstances.
*   **S**ensitive: It should detect even small changes in the situation.
*   **S**pecific: It should reflect changes only in the situation concerned,.

### 2. Disability Rates (Disability Indicators)

Since death rates have declined in many countries, mortality indicators alone are insufficient. [[Disability rates]] are used to supplement mortality and morbidity data to assess the "quality of life" and the full range of daily activities,.

These are broadly classified into two groups:

#### A. Event-Type Indicators
These measure the occurrence of specific events preventing normal function,.
*   **Number of days of restricted activity:** Days where a person cuts down on their usual activities.
*   **Bed disability days:** Number of days a person is confined to bed.
*   **Work-loss days:** Days lost from work due to illness/injury.

#### B. Person-Type Indicators
These measure the limitation of a person's function over a period,.
*   **Limitation of Mobility:** Example: Confined to bed or house, or needing special aid to move around.
*   **Limitation of Activity:** Limitation in performing **Activities of Daily Living (ADL)** such as eating, washing, dressing, or going to the toilet.

#### C. Summary Measures of Population Health (Advanced Indicators)

| Indicator | Description | Clinical/Public Health Relevance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Sullivan's Index]]** | **Life Expectancy minus Duration of Disability.**<br>It represents the expectation of life free of disability. | Used to calculate disability-free life expectancy. Example: If Life Expectancy is 70.2 years and bed disability is 5.3 years, Sullivan's Index is 64.9 years. |
| **[[HALE]]** (Health-Adjusted Life Expectancy) | Equivalent number of years in **full health** that a newborn can expect to live based on current rates of ill health and mortality. | Formerly called DALE. It is a positive indicator of health status,. |
| **[[DALY]]** (Disability-Adjusted Life Year) | Measures the **burden of disease**.<br>**DALY = YLL (Years of Lost Life) + YLD (Years Lived with Disability)**. | One DALY = One lost year of healthy life. Used to set health priorities,,. |

> **Mnemonic for DALY vs QALY:**
> *   **D**ALY is for **D**amage/Disease Burden (Years **Lost**).
> *   **Q**ALY is for **Q**uality (Years **Gained** by intervention).

### 3. Concept of Disability Limitation

**Definition:**
[[Disability Limitation]] is a mode of intervention under **Tertiary Prevention**. It involves all measures taken to prevent the transition of the disease process from impairment to handicap,.

**Objective:**
To halt the disease process when it has advanced beyond the early stages, preventing the patient from becoming effectively "useless" to society or dependent on others.

**The Sequence of Events (WHO):**
The progression of a health condition is described as follows:
**Disease $\rightarrow$ Impairment $\rightarrow$ Disability $\rightarrow$ Handicap**,.

#### Understanding the Terms with Example:

| Term | Definition,, | **Example: Road Traffic Accident**, |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Disease** | Abnormal condition impairing function. | Accident / Trauma |
| **Impairment** | Loss or abnormality of psychological, physiological, or anatomical structure/function. | Loss of Foot (Anatomical loss) |
| **Disability** | Restriction or lack of ability to perform an activity in a manner considered normal. | Cannot Walk (Functional loss) |
| **Handicap** | A disadvantage resulting from impairment/disability that limits the fulfillment of a role (social/economic). | Unemployed (Social disadvantage) |

**Intervention (Disability Limitation):**
Intervention typically involves medical and surgical measures to limit the damage.
*   **Example:** In a patient with **Leprosy**, nerve damage is an *impairment*. If not treated, it leads to *disability* (loss of sensation/movement). Through reconstructive surgery and physiotherapy (Disability Limitation), we prevent the patient from becoming *handicapped* (socially isolated or unable to work),.
