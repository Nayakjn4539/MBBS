# [[Intra-Ocular Tumours]] > Iris tumours

### Classification of Iris Tumours

Tumours of the [[Iris]] can be broadly classified based on their nature (benign or malignant) and their origin (pigmented, vascular, or cystic).

| **Category** | **Specific Lesions** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Benign Tumours** | • [[Iris Naevus]] (Benign Melanoma)<br>• [[Lisch Nodules]] (Neurofibromatosis)<br>• [[Naevoxanthoendothelioma]] (Juvenile Xanthogranuloma)<br>• [[Leiomyoma]] (Rare) |
| **Malignant Tumours** | • [[Malignant Melanoma of Iris]]<br>• Metastatic Tumours |
| **Cysts** | • Serous Cysts<br>• Implantation Cysts (Pearl Cysts)<br>• Parasitic Cysts ([[Cysticercus]])<br>• Drug-induced Cysts ([[Miotics]]) |

### Benign Tumours of the Iris

#### 1. Iris Naevus (Simple Melanoma)
*   **Definition:** Common pigmented lesions arising from congenital aggregations of pigment cells in the [[Iris Stroma]].
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Appears as a flat, circumscribed lesion.
    *   Variable size; usually dark brown or slate-grey.
    *   **Clinical Implication:** Generally benign (stationary), but any increase in size or vascularity must be watched with suspicion for malignant transformation,.

#### 2. Lisch Nodules
*   **Association:** Pathognomonic for **Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF-1)**.
*   **Appearance:** Bilateral, multiple, well-defined, dome-shaped gelatinous elevations protruding above the iris surface.
*   **Color:** Ranges from clear to yellow or brown.
*   **Significance:** Found in prepubertal children. Their presence correlates with age but *not* with the severity of the disease or the number of [[Neurofibromas]].

#### 3. Naevoxanthoendothelioma (Juvenile Xanthogranuloma)
*   **Demographics:** Rare, fleshy vascular lesion seen in babies.
*   **Clinical Feature:** It is a vascularized granuloma that may cause recurrent [[Hyphema]] (blood in the anterior chamber).
*   **Treatment:** [[Radiotherapy]] (X-rays) or [[Steroids]].

### Cysts of the Iris

Cysts may be mistaken for solid tumours but can be differentiated by transillumination (cysts allow light to pass; solid tumours do not).

1.  **Serous Cysts:** Due to closure of [[Iris Crypts]] with retention of fluid.
2.  **Implantation Cysts (Pearl Cysts):**
    *   **Etiology:** Occurs after perforating wounds or surgery where corneal/conjunctival epithelium is implanted into the iris.
    *   **Pathology:** The epithelium proliferates to form a cyst (pearl cyst) or may line the anterior chamber causing intractable [[Glaucoma]],.
3.  **Parasitic Cysts:** Rarely, [[Cysticercus Cellulosae]] or hydatid cysts may lodge in the iris.
4.  **Miotic Cysts:** Seen near the pupillary margin in patients using strong miotic drops (e.g., [[Pilocarpine]]) for a long duration.

### Malignant Melanoma of the Iris

While rare compared to choroidal melanoma, this is the most important primary neoplasm of the iris.

#### Clinical Features
*   **Incidence:** Usually affects elderly patients (40–60 years).
*   **Appearance:**
    *   Solitary nodule growing rapidly.
    *   Usually pigmented (melanin) but can be unpigmented (amelanotic melanoma).
    *   May present as a rapidly growing vascular nodule,.
*   **Location:** Can be located anywhere on the iris but has a tendency to spread towards the [[Anterior Chamber Angle]].

#### Course and Complications
1.  **Spread:** It spreads over the surface of the iris and into the angle.
2.  **Secondary Glaucoma:** Invasion of the angle blocks the trabecular meshwork.
3.  **Extraocular Extension:** It may penetrate through the [[Limbus]] and present as an epibulbar mass.
4.  **Metastasis:** Distant metastasis is rare compared to ciliary body or choroidal melanomas but can occur,.

#### Pathology
*   Composed of spindle-shaped or round cells (spindle A, spindle B, epithelioid, or mixed).
*   **Pigmentation:** Variable; pigment is chiefly melanin.
*   **Differentiation:** Must be differentiated from a granulomatous lesion (e.g., [[Tuberculoma]] or [[Gumma]]) based on the absence of inflammation and density of pigmentation.

#### Treatment
Management depends on the size and extent of the tumour:

| **Extent of Tumour** | **Surgical Management** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Limited to Iris** | **Wide Iridectomy:** Excision of the tumour with clear margins. |
| **Involving Iris Root & Ciliary Body** | **Iridocyclectomy:** Removal of part of the iris and ciliary body,. |
| **Associated with Secondary Glaucoma** | **Enucleation:** Removal of the entire eyeball is indicated when the angle is invaded causing glaucoma or extensive spread,. |

### Summary of Iris Nodules

Differentiation of nodules on the iris is crucial for diagnosis:

*   **Lisch Nodules:** Gelatinous, dome-shaped (Neurofibromatosis).
*   **Koeppe’s Nodules:** At the pupillary border (Granulomatous [[Uveitis]]).
*   **Busacca’s Nodules:** On the surface/base of the iris (Granulomatous Uveitis).
*   **Melanoma:** Solid, pigmented, vascular, growing nodule.
*   **Brushfield Spots:** Light-colored spots on the iris seen in [[Down Syndrome]],.
