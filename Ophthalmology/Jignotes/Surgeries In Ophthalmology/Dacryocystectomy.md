# Dacryocystectomy (DCT) and Surgical Instruments

## Overview: Dacryocystectomy (DCT)

**Definition:** [[Dacryocystectomy]] (DCT) is the surgical excision of the [[lacrimal sac]]. Unlike [[Dacryocystorhinostomy]] (DCR), which establishes drainage, DCT results in the removal of the reservoir, usually leaving the patient with permanent epiphora (watering) but removing the source of chronic infection.

### Indications for DCT
DCT is performed only when [[Dacryocystorhinostomy]] (DCR) is contraindicated or technically impossible.

**Absolute and Relative Indications:**
1.  **Tumors:** Malignancies or tumors of the [[lacrimal sac]].
2.  **Chronic Granulomatous Infections:** [[Tuberculosis]], [[Syphilis]], [[Leprosy]], or Mycotic (fungal) infections of the sac.
3.  **Gross Nasal Pathology:** Severe [[atrophic rhinitis]] (where DCR would fail or cause spread of infection).
4.  **Age Extremes:** Too young (infants <4 years) or too old (>60 years) where DCR is risky or difficult.
5.  **Fibrosed Sac:** A markedly shrunken and fibrosed sac (dry sac) where a flap for DCR cannot be formed.

**Clinical Implication:**
*   **Epiphora:** The patient must be counseled that DCT will result in permanent watering (epiphora) as the drainage mechanism is removed. This is a trade-off to eliminate chronic discharge and risk of [[lacrimal abscess]].

## Surgical Steps of DCT

1.  **Incision:** Similar to external DCR (curved incision along the anterior lacrimal crest).
2.  **Dissection:** The [[lacrimal sac]] is exposed and separated from surrounding structures (periosteum and medial palpebral ligament) by blunt dissection.
3.  **Removal:** Connections to the canaliculi are cut. The sac is twisted with artery forceps and torn away from the [[nasolacrimal duct]].
4.  **Curettage:** The bony [[nasolacrimal duct]] is curetted to remove infected mucosa.
5.  **Closure:** The incision is closed in layers.

## Surgical Instruments for Lacrimal Surgery

The following instruments are essential for lacrimal surgeries (DCR/DCT) and orbital procedures.

### 1. Scalpel Handle (Bard-Parker Handle)
*   **Description:** A flat metal handle, commonly known as the **BP Handle**. It has a groove at the tip to fit disposable blades.
*   **Use:** To hold surgical blades (No. 11 or 15) for making skin incisions during [[Dacryocystectomy]], [[Dacryocystorhinostomy]], or [[Orbitotomy]].

### 2. Artery Forceps (Haemostatic Forceps)
*   **Description:** A blunt-tipped stout forceps with a scissor-like configuration and a locking mechanism (catch) near the rings. It has transverse serrations on the jaws.
    *   Small size: Mosquito forceps (straight or curved).
*   **Uses:**
    *   **Haemostasis:** To catch bleeding vessels during lid and lacrimal sac surgery.
    *   **Traction:** To hold stay sutures (skin/muscle).
    *   **Blunt Dissection:** To hold small "peanut" gauze pellets for blunt dissection of the [[lacrimal sac]].
    *   **Removal:** In DCT, used to hold and twist the lacrimal sac to avulse it from the nasolacrimal duct.

### 3. Lacrimal Dissector and Curette
*   **Description:** A cylindrical double-ended instrument. One end is a blunt-tipped dissector, and the other is a scoop/curette.
*   **Uses:**
    *   **Dissection:** The blunt end is used to separate the [[lacrimal sac]] from the lacrimal fossa and surrounding fascia during DCT and DCR.
    *   **Curettage:** The scoop end is used to curette the bony [[nasolacrimal duct]] to remove infective membranous remnants during DCT.

### 4. Muller’s Retractor (Self-retaining Lacrimal Wound Retractor)
*   **Description:** A self-retaining instrument with two limbs. Each limb has three curved pins/claws to engage the skin edges. A screw mechanism holds the limbs in a retracted position.
*   **Use:** To retract skin margins during lacrimal sac surgeries (DCT/DCR), freeing the surgeon's hands.

### 5. Cat’s Paw Retractor
*   **Description:** A fork-like instrument with terminals bent inward, resembling a paw.
*   **Use:** Used to retract skin during lacrimal sac and lid surgery. Unlike Muller's, this is **not** self-retaining and requires an assistant to hold it.

### 6. Bone Punch (Citelli’s or Kerrison’s)
*   **Description:** Consists of a stout spring handle and two blades at a right angle. The upper blade cuts into the lower blade (cup-like depression).
*   **Use:**
    *   Primarily for **DCR**: To enlarge the bony ostium by "punching" out the bone (lacrimal bone and frontal process of maxilla).
    *   In **DCT**: Rarely used unless the anterior lacrimal crest obstructs access to a fibrosed sac.

### 7. Hammer and Chisel
*   **Chisel:** A blade with a sharp straight cutting edge, beveled on one surface, attached to a stout handle.
*   **Hammer:** A small steel mallet with a corrugated handle.
*   **Use:** To cut bone (osteotomy) during DCR or [[Orbitotomy]]. The chisel is placed on the bone, and the hammer strikes it to remove the anterior lacrimal crest or make a window in the bone.

### 8. Bone Gouge
*   **Description:** A stout metallic handle with a longitudinally scooped end. The edges of the scoop are sharp.
*   **Use:** To smoothen irregularly cut bone margins by nibbling small projecting bone fragments during DCR and orbitotomy.

### 9. Rougine (Freer’s Periosteum Elevator)
*   **Description:** A double-ended instrument with a rounded handle and slightly curved, tear-drop shaped tips.
*   **Uses:**
    *   **Elevation:** To lift and separate the [[periosteum]] from the bone (e.g., separating periosteum from the anterior lacrimal crest).
    *   **Dissection:** For blunt debulking and dissection in confined areas like the medial canthus.

### 10. Needle Holder
*   **Description:** Instruments designed to hold surgical needles firmly. Jaws are finely serrated.
    *   **Castroviejo:** Spring action with S-shaped locking (for delicate work).
    *   **Arruga’s/Steven’s:** Larger needle holders with a broad thumb plate.
*   **Use:** Suturing the operative wound (orbicularis muscle and skin) at the end of DCT/DCR.
