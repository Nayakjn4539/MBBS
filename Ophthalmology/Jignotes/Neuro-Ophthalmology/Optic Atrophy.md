# [[Neuro-Ophthalmology]] > Optic Atrophy

# Optic Atrophy

[[Optic Atrophy]] refers to the degeneration of the [[optic nerve]] fibers (axons), which occurs as an end result of any pathologic process that damages axons in the anterior visual system, i.e., from [[retinal ganglion cells]] to the [[lateral geniculate body]]. Although the nerve appears pale, the pallor is not due to the atrophy of nerve fibers themselves but due to the loss of vascularity (obliteration of capillaries).

### Clinical Features
The ophthalmoscopic signs cannot always be correlated with the amount of vision loss, as a pale disc may still retain some vision.
*   **Visual Loss:** Varies from slight impairment to total blindness.
*   **Pupil:** Semi-dilated; direct light reflex is sluggish or absent. In unilateral cases, a [[Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect]] (RAPD) or [[Marcus Gunn Pupil]] is present.
*   **Visual Fields:** Concentric contraction, sector defects, or scotomas depending on the cause.
*   **Colour Vision:** Impairment is common; Red-Green defects are seen in optic nerve lesions, while Blue-Yellow defects are seen in retinal lesions.
*   **Kestenbaum Index:** There is a decrease in the number of small blood vessels on the disc. The normal ratio of large to small vessels (4:10) is reduced (e.g., <7 small vessels).

### Classification of Optic Atrophy
Optic atrophy is classified based on ophthalmoscopic appearance into four main types:
1.  **Primary (Simple) Optic Atrophy**
2.  **Secondary (Post-Neuritic) Optic Atrophy**
3.  **Consecutive Optic Atrophy**
4.  **Glaucomatous (Cavernous) Optic Atrophy**

#### 1. Primary (Simple) Optic Atrophy
This results from lesions proximal to the optic disc without antecedent [[papilledema]] or papillitis. The degeneration is orderly, with columnar gliosis replacing nerve fibers.

*   **Etiology:**
    *   **Demyelinating diseases:** [[Multiple Sclerosis]] (most common cause).
    *   **Compressive lesions:** [[Pituitary tumors]], [[Craniopharyngioma]], Meningiomas.
    *   **Trauma:** Avulsion or severance of the optic nerve.
    *   **Toxic/Nutritional:** Tobacco-alcohol amblyopia, Methyl alcohol, Ethambutol.
    *   **Hereditary:** [[Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy]] (LHON).
    *   **Infections:** Tabes dorsalis (Neurosyphilis).

*   **Ophthalmoscopic Features:**
    *   **Colour:** Chalky white or white with a bluish hue.
    *   **Margins:** Sharply defined (well-delineated).
    *   **Lamina Cribrosa:** Clearly seen (stippling present) at the bottom of the cup.
    *   **Cup:** Shallow, saucer-shaped (atrophic cupping).
    *   **Vessels:** Normal or slightly attenuated.
    *   **Surrounding Retina:** Normal.

#### 2. Secondary (Post-Neuritic) Optic Atrophy
This develops as a sequela to long-standing [[papilledema]] or [[papillitis]] (inflammation of the optic nerve head). The degeneration is associated with excessive gliosis.

*   **Etiology:**
    *   Chronic Papilledema.
    *   Papillitis (Optic Neuritis affecting the disc).
    *   Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy ([[AION]]).

*   **Ophthalmoscopic Features:**
    *   **Colour:** Dirty grey-white or dirty white.
    *   **Margins:** Ill-defined and blurred due to gliosis extending over the edges.
    *   **Lamina Cribrosa:** Not visible (obscured by organized fibrous tissue).
    *   **Cup:** Obliterated/Filled in.
    *   **Vessels:** Tortuous and constricted; perivascular sheathing (white lines) may be present.
    *   **Surrounding Retina:** May show pigmentary changes (Macula may show pigmentary disturbance).

#### 3. Consecutive Optic Atrophy
This occurs following the destruction of ganglion cells secondary to degenerative or inflammatory lesions of the [[choroid]] or [[retina]] (Ascending optic atrophy).

*   **Etiology:**
    *   [[Retinitis Pigmentosa]].
    *   Diffuse Chorioretinitis.
    *   [[Central Retinal Artery Occlusion]] (CRAO).
    *   Pathological Myopia.

*   **Ophthalmoscopic Features:**
    *   **Colour:** Yellowish waxy pallor (Waxy disc).
    *   **Margins:** Usually ill-defined (less sharply defined than primary).
    *   **Vessels:** Markedly attenuated (thread-like).
    *   **Cup:** Normal.
    *   **Surrounding Retina:** Shows pathology (e.g., bony spicules in Retinitis Pigmentosa).

#### 4. Glaucomatous (Cavernous) Optic Atrophy
This is caused by long-standing raised [[intraocular pressure]] (IOP). It is also known as **Schnabel's cavernous atrophy**.

*   **Pathology:** Degeneration of nerve fibers with negligible gliosis. Mucoid degeneration of glial cells leads to the formation of large caverns or lacunae filled with hyaluronic acid.
*   **Ophthalmoscopic Features:**
    *   **Cupping:** Deep and wide excavation (Cup:Disc ratio > 0.5).
    *   **Nasal Shift:** Vessels are shifted nasally.
    *   **Bayonetting Sign:** Double bending of vessels at the disc margin.
    *   **Laminar Dot Sign:** Visibility of lamina cribrosa pores up to the margin.
    *   **Neuroretinal Rim:** Thinning or notching (especially vertical/polar notching).

#### 5. Vascular (Ischemic) Optic Atrophy
Resulting from disc ischemia (other than glaucoma), such as in [[Giant Cell Arteritis]] (Arteritic AION) or severe hemorrhage. Features include pallor of the disc with marked attenuation of vessels.

### Clinical Implications
1.  **Visual Prognosis:** No deduction as to the amount of vision can be made solely from the ophthalmoscopic appearance of atrophy.
2.  **Unilateral vs. Bilateral:**
    *   **Unilateral:** Suggests optic neuritis, trauma, or compressive lesions.
    *   **Bilateral:** Suggests toxic/nutritional causes, hereditary conditions (Leber's), or secondary to papilledema.
3.  **[[Foster-Kennedy Syndrome]]:** Unilateral optic atrophy (due to direct tumor pressure, e.g., frontal lobe tumor) with contralateral papilledema (due to raised ICP).
4.  **[[Pseudo-Foster Kennedy Syndrome]]:** Unilateral optic atrophy with contralateral disc edema due to Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (AION), not a tumor.
