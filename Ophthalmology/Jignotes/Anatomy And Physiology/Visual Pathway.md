# [[Anatomy And Physiology]] > Visual Pathway

### **Overview of the Visual Pathway**

The [[visual pathway]] constitutes the neural path of visual sensations from the [[retina]] to the [[visual cortex]] in the occipital lobe. It is unique compared to somatic sensory pathways regarding its neuronal organization.

### **1. Components of the Visual Pathway**

The pathway consists of the following structures in sequential order:
1.  **Retina** (First and Second order neurons)
2.  **Optic Nerve** (Second order axons)
3.  **Optic Chiasma**
4.  **Optic Tract**
5.  **Lateral Geniculate Body** (Third order neurons)
6.  **Optic Radiations** (Geniculocalcarine tract)
7.  **Visual Cortex** (Occipital Lobe)

#### **A. Retina**
*   **Receptors:** [[Rods]] and [[Cones]] act as sensory nerve endings.
*   **First Order Neurons:** [[Bipolar cells]] of the inner nuclear layer.
*   **Second Order Neurons:** [[Ganglion cells]]. Their axons form the nerve fiber layer and converge to form the [[optic nerve]].

#### **B. Optic Nerve (ON)**
It acts as a white matter tract of the [[central nervous system]] rather than a peripheral nerve (no neurilemma, does not regenerate if cut).
*   **Total Length:** 47–50 mm.
*   **Segments:**
    1.  **Intraocular:** 1 mm (Optic disc/nerve head).
    2.  **Intraorbital:** 30 mm (Longest part; S-shaped to allow eye movement).
    3.  **Intracanalicular:** 6–9 mm (Within optic canal).
    4.  **Intracranial:** 10 mm (Joins chiasma).
*   **Fiber Arrangement:**
    *   **Peripheral fibers:** From peripheral retina.
    *   **Central fibers:** [[Papillomacular bundle]] (from macula). Initially temporal at the disc, they move centrally in the posterior nerve.

#### **C. Optic Chiasma**
*   **Location:** Lies over the tuberculum and [[diaphragma sellae]] (roof of the pituitary).
*   **Decussation:**
    *   **Nasal fibers** (responsible for temporal field) **cross** to the opposite side.
    *   **Temporal fibers** (responsible for nasal field) remain **uncrossed** (ipsilateral).
    *   **Wilbrand's Knee:** Inferior nasal fibers loop forward into the contralateral proximal optic nerve before turning back into the optic tract.

#### **D. Optic Tract**
*   Cylindrical bundles running outwards and backwards.
*   **Composition:** Contains ipsilateral temporal fibers and contralateral nasal fibers.
*   **Termination:**
    *   **Visual fibers:** End in the [[Lateral Geniculate Body]] (LGB).
    *   **Pupillary fibers:** Leave the tract *before* the LGB to reach the [[pretectal nucleus]] (midbrain) via the superior brachium.

#### **E. Lateral Geniculate Body (LGB)**
*   **Function:** Relay center (Thalamus). Contains the **Third Order Neurons**.
*   **Structure:** Consists of 6 layers.
    *   **Layers 1, 4, 6:** Receive fibers from the **Contralateral** eye.
    *   **Layers 2, 3, 5:** Receive fibers from the **Ipsilateral** eye.
*   **Functional Division:**
    *   **Magnocellular Pathway (Layers 1, 2):** Large cells; detect motion, flicker, and black/white (scotopic) vision.
    *   **Parvocellular Pathway (Layers 3-6):** Small cells; detect color and fine details (photopic vision).

#### **F. Optic Radiations (Geniculocalcarine Tract)**
Axons of the third-order neurons running from LGB to the visual cortex.
*   **Inferior Fibers (Meyer's Loop):** Loop around the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle in the [[temporal lobe]]. Represent the **superior visual field**.
*   **Superior Fibers (Baum's Loop):** Travel through the [[parietal lobe]]. Represent the **inferior visual field**.

#### **G. Visual Cortex**
*   **Location:** Medial aspect of the [[occipital lobe]].
*   **Areas (Brodmann):**
    *   **Area 17 (Striate Cortex):** Primary visual area. Contains the white **Line of Gennari**.
    *   **Areas 18, 19 (Parastriate/Peristriate):** Visual association areas.
*   **Representation:**
    *   **Macula:** Represented at the tip of the occipital pole (largest representation).
    *   **Peripheral Retina:** Represented anteriorly.

### **2. Blood Supply of the Visual Pathway**

| Structure | Blood Supply |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Optic Nerve (Intraocular)** | [[Short posterior ciliary arteries]] & [[Circle of Zinn]] |
| **Optic Nerve (Intraorbital)** | Pial plexus (from Ophthalmic artery) & Central retinal artery |
| **Optic Chiasma** | [[Anterior cerebral artery]], [[Internal carotid artery]] |
| **Optic Tract** | [[Anterior choroidal artery]] |
| **Optic Radiations** | Middle & Posterior cerebral arteries |
| **Visual Cortex** | [[Posterior cerebral artery]] (mainly) & [[Middle cerebral artery]] (macular tip - dual supply) |

### **3. Lesions and Visual Field Defects**

The relationship between the anatomical site of the lesion and the resulting field defect is crucial for localization.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Visual field defects corresponding to lesion sites

| Site of Lesion | Visual Field Defect | Clinical Implications/Causes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Optic Nerve** | **Ipsilateral Anopia** (Blindness) | [[Optic neuritis]], Trauma, [[Optic atrophy]]. |
| **2. Proximal Optic Nerve** | **Junctional Scotoma** | Involves ipsilateral optic nerve + contralateral inferior nasal fibers (Wilbrand's knee). Seen in [[Meningioma]]. |
| **3. Optic Chiasma (Central)**| **Bitemporal Hemianopia** | Lesion of crossing nasal fibers. Causes: [[Pituitary adenoma]] (compresses from below - superior temporal defect first), [[Craniopharyngioma]] (from above - inferior temporal defect first). |
| **4. Optic Chiasma (Lateral)**| **Binasal Hemianopia** | Very rare. Lesion of temporal fibers. Cause: Atheroma of carotids distending and compressing sides. |
| **5. Optic Tract** | **Contralateral Homonymous Hemianopia** | **Incongruous** defect. Associated with [[Wernicke's hemianopic pupil]] (pupil reflex absent when light shone on blind hemiretina). |
| **6. Temporal Lobe (Meyer's Loop)** | **Contralateral Superior Quadrantanopia** | **"Pie in the Sky"**. Incongruous. |
| **7. Parietal Lobe** | **Contralateral Inferior Quadrantanopia** | **"Pie on the Floor"**. Incongruous. |
| **8. Visual Cortex (Total)** | **Contralateral Homonymous Hemianopia** | **Congruous** defect. |
| **9. Occipital Tip** | **Contralateral Homonymous Macular Defect** | Trauma to the tip of occipital lobe. |
| **10. Visual Cortex (Vascular)** | **Contralateral Homonymous Hemianopia with Macular Sparing** | Due to dual blood supply of the macular cortex (PCA + MCA). PCA occlusion affects periphery but MCA preserves the macula. |

### **4. Important Clinical Signs & Mnemonics**

#### **Clinical Signs**
*   **Wernicke's Hemianopic Pupil:** Indicates an [[optic tract]] lesion. Light reflex is absent on the blind side of the retina because pupillary fibers branch off at the tract, but present on the seeing side.
*   **Macular Sparing:** Hallmark of [[occipital cortex]] lesions (vascular etiology).
*   **Congruity:**
    *   **Incongruous defects:** Lesions closer to the chiasma (Optic tract, Radiations).
    *   **Congruous defects:** Lesions closer to the cortex.

#### **Mnemonics**
*   **TIPS:** **T**emporal lobe lesion = **I**nferior fibers (Meyer's) damaged = **P**ie in the **S**ky (Superior quadrantanopia).
*   **Parietal = Floor:** Parietal lobe lesion = Pie on the Floor (Inferior quadrantanopia).
*   **LGN Layers:** **1, 4, 6** (Crossed/Contralateral) - Add up to 11? No mnemonic, just remember **C**ontralateral = **C**omplex numbers (1,4,6). **2, 3, 5** (Uncrossed/Ipsilateral).
