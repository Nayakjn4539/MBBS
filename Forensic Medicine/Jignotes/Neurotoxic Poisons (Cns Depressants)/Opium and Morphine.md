# [[Neurotoxic Poisons (Cns Depressants)]] > Opium and Morphine

### Opium and Morphine

**Opium** is the dried juice (latex) obtained by incision of the unripe capsules of the white poppy plant, **[[Papaver somniferum]]**. It acts as a Somniferous poison (narcotic/sleep-inducing).

#### Active Principles (Alkaloids)
Crude opium contains about 25 alkaloids, classified into two distinct chemical groups:

| Group | Characteristics | Examples | Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phenanthrene** | **Narcotic**, Sedative, Analgesic | **[[Morphine]]** (10%)<br>**[[Codeine]]** (0.5%)<br>**Thebaine** (0.3%) | Acts on CNS. Morphine is the principal alkaloid. Thebaine is a convulsant (exception). |
| **Isoquinoline** | **Non-narcotic**, Mild analgesic, Antispasmodic | **Papaverine** (1%)<br>**Noscapine/Narcotine** (6%) | Relaxes smooth muscles. Little to no CNS effect. |

**Mechanism of Action:**
*   Opioids bind to specific receptors in the CNS: **Mu ($\mu$)**, **Kappa ($\kappa$)**, and **Delta ($\delta$)**.
*   **Mu receptors:** Responsible for analgesia, euphoria, respiratory depression, and miosis.
*   **Kappa receptors:** Responsible for sedation and spinal analgesia.

### Acute Poisoning: Clinical Features
The symptoms appear rapidly (within minutes if injected, 30-60 mins if ingested). The clinical course passes through **three stages**:

#### 1. Stage of Excitement
*   *Note:* This stage is often short or absent in addicts or massive overdoses.
*   Euphoria and sense of well-being.
*   Increased mental activity and physical energy.
*   Flushing of the face and tachycardia.
*   Hallucinations (rarely).

#### 2. Stage of Stupor
*   Headache, nausea, and vomiting.
*   Giddiness and heaviness of limbs.
*   **Drowsiness:** The patient wants to sleep but can be aroused by shouting or painful stimuli.
*   **Pupils:** Contracted but still react to light.
*   Skin: Itching sensation.

#### 3. Stage of Narcosis (Deep Coma)
This is the terminal phase.
*   **Deep Coma:** Patient cannot be aroused.
*   **Muscles:** Flaccid and relaxed; reflexes abolished.
*   **Pupils:** **[[Pinpoint pupils]]** (miosis) that do not react to light.
    *   *Note:* Pupils may dilate terminally due to asphyxia/hypoxia.
*   **Respiration:** Slow, irregular, and stertorous (3–4 breaths/minute). **[[Cheyne-Stokes respiration]]** may be present.
*   **Skin:** Cold and clammy; profuse perspiration; cyanosis of lips/nails.
*   **Temperature:** Hypothermia.

> *   **P** - Pinpoint Pupils
> *   **R** - Respiratory Depression

### Diagnosis and Differential Diagnosis

**Bedside Test:** **Marquis Test** (Formaldehyde + Sulfuric acid) $\rightarrow$ Purple/Violet color indicates opium alkaloids.

**Differential Diagnosis: Opium Poisoning vs. Pontine Hemorrhage**
Both present with coma and pinpoint pupils.

| Feature | **[[Opium Poisoning]]** | **[[Pontine Hemorrhage]]** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Onset** | Gradual (progressive stages) | Sudden (apoplectic) |
| **Pupils** | Pinpoint; **dilate on pinching the neck** (pain stimulus) or terminally | Pinpoint; **do not dilate** on pain stimulus |
| **Temperature** | **Hypothermia** (Body is cold) | **Hyperpyrexia** (Body is hot) |
| **Paralysis** | Generalized flaccidity | Paralysis of limbs (often spastic) |
| **CSF** | Normal | May show blood/xanthochromia |

### Fatal Dose and Period
*   **Fatal Dose:**
    *   Crude Opium: **2 grams**
    *   Morphine: **200 mg** (non-addict)
    *   Codeine: 500–800 mg
    *   Heroin: 50 mg
    *   *Note:* Addicts have high tolerance and may survive doses 10x the fatal dose.
*   **Fatal Period:** **6 to 12 hours** (death usually due to respiratory failure).

### Management and Treatment

1.  **Stabilization (ABCD):** Maintain Airway, Breathing, Circulation. Artificial respiration is critical.
2.  **[[Gastric Lavage]] (Stomach Wash):**
    *   **Essential step:** Must be done even if the drug was **injected** (parenteral route).
    *   **Reason:** Morphine is excreted into the stomach from the blood (entero-gastric cycle) and can be reabsorbed.
    *   **Solution:** **Potassium Permanganate (KMnO$_4$) 1:5000**. It oxidizes the alkaloid. Lavage should be repeated at intervals.
3.  **Specific Antidote:** **[[Naloxone]]**
    *   Pure opioid antagonist.
    *   **Dose:** 0.4 mg to 2 mg IV; repeat every 2–3 minutes if no response (up to 10 mg).
    *   **Observation:** Patient must be monitored because Naloxone's half-life is shorter than morphine; patient may slip back into coma ("Renarcotization").
4.  **Symptomatic:**
    *   Keep patient warm (treat hypothermia).
    *   **Coma Cocktail:** Dextrose + Thiamine + Naloxone (if etiology unknown).
    *   Do **NOT** give stimulants like Strychnine or Picrotoxin.

### Postmortem Findings

**External:**
*   **Cyanosis:** Face, lips, fingernails (blue).
*   **Froth:** Fine, white/blood-stained froth at nose and mouth (due to [[Pulmonary Edema]]).
*   **Injection Marks:** Look for needle tracks, fibrosis, or abscesses in addicts (mainliners/skin poppers).
*   **Tattooing:** Carbon particles from needle sterilization may cause "Turkey skin" appearance.
*   **Rigor Mortis:** Sets in early.

**Internal:**
*   **Stomach:** May contain brownish lumps of opium; characteristic **peculiar odour** (bitter/musty).
*   **Lungs:** Voluminous, edematous, congested (Gross pulmonary edema is a hallmark).
*   **Brain:** Congested; cerebral edema.

### Chronic Poisoning (Morphinism)
Seen in addicts.
*   **Symptoms:** Physical and moral deterioration, emaciation, loss of appetite, constipation, impotence/sterility, tremors, miosis (constricted pupils), scarred veins.
*   **Withdrawal Syndrome:** Lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, gooseflesh ("Cold Turkey"), tremors, anxiety, dilated pupils.

### Medicolegal Aspects
1.  **Suicide:** Ideal suicidal poison (painless, peaceful death). Common in healthcare professionals (easy access).
2.  **Accidental:** Overdose in addicts; infants given opium to keep them quiet (infanticide/accidental).
3.  **Homicide:** Rare due to bitter taste and smell, but can be masked in food/alcohol.
4.  **Cattle Poisoning:** Sometimes used.
5.  **Body Packers:** Smugglers swallow condoms filled with heroin; rupture causes "Body Packer Syndrome" (massive overdose).
