# [[Diseases Of Retina]] > Albinism

### **Albinism**

**Definition**
Albinism is a hereditary condition characterized by a defective development or absence of pigment (melanin) throughout the body or localized to the eye. It is a congenital anomaly of the [[Uveal tract]] and [[Retina]],.

**Classification**
Based on the distribution of hypopigmentation, it is divided into:
1.  **[[Oculocutaneous Albinism]]:** Affects eyes, skin, and hair.
2.  **[[Ocular Albinism]]:** Absence of pigment is limited to the choroid and retina; skin and hair are normal.
3.  **Cutaneous form:** Affects skin only.
*   *Note:* The condition is further subdivided based on the **Tyrosinase test**.

**Inheritance**
*   **Total Albinism:** Extremely rare; microscopic examination usually shows traces of pigment in the retinal epithelium.
*   **Partial Albinism:** More common form.

**Clinical Features**

**1. Symptoms**
*   **[[Photophobia]]:** Intolerance to light due to lack of pigment in the iris and choroid,.
*   **[[Hemeralopia]] (Day Blindness):** Patients see better in dim light than in bright light,.
*   **Defective Vision:** Significant visual impairment is usually present.
*   **Dazzling Glare:** Due to scattering of light.

**2. Ocular Signs (Anterior Segment)**
*   **[[Iris]]:** 
    *   Appears **pink** due to the absence of pigment, allowing the red reflex from the fundus to be seen through the translucent stroma.
    *   In partial albinism, irides may be **blue**.
    *   **Transillumination defects** of the iris are characteristic.
*   **[[Pupil]]:** May appear red/pinkish due to light reflection.
*   **[[Poliosis]]:** Greying or whitening of eyelashes and eyebrows.

**3. Ocular Signs (Posterior Segment/Fundus)**
*   **[[Albinotic Fundus]]:** 
    *   Retinal and choroidal vessels are seen with great clarity against the white background.
    *   **Sclera** shines through the glistening white spaces between vessels due to the absence of pigment in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid,.
*   **[[Macula]]:** 
    *   In partial albinism, macular regions may be pigmented and look normal.
    *   However, in generalized forms, the macula is typically underdeveloped.

**4. Associated Ocular Anomalies**
*   **[[Nystagmus]]:** Pendular nystagmus is a constant feature due to poor fixation,.
*   **[[Strabismus]] (Squint):** Frequently associated.
*   **Refractive Errors:** High refractive errors causing astigmatism are common.
*   **[[Amblyopia]]:** Congenital amblyopia often develops due to foveal hypoplasia.

**Pathophysiology of Visual Loss**
The primary cause of poor vision in albinism is **[[Foveal Hypoplasia]]**.
*   Foveal development is impaired due to the lack of melanin during embryogenesis.
*   This leads to decreased visual acuity, nystagmus, and squint.
*   Glaucoma is **not** a feature of albinism.

**Diagnostic Findings**
*   **Ophthalmoscopy:** Reveals the characteristic "Albinotic Fundus" where choroidal vessels are distinct against the white sclera.
*   **Tyrosinase Test:** Used to classify the type of albinism.

**Management**
*   **Optical Correction:** Correction of refractive errors (glasses).
*   **Tinted Glasses:** Essential to protect from glare and photophobia.
*   **Low Vision Aids:** May be required for reading and near work.
*   **Genetic Counseling:** As it is a hereditary condition.

**Clinical Implications**
*   **Differential Diagnosis:** Must be distinguished from **[[Total colour blindness]]** (Achromatopsia) where the fundus is normal, but photophobia and nystagmus are present.
*   **Aniridia:** Albinism shares features like nystagmus and foveal hypoplasia with Aniridia, but the iris structure is fundamentally different (absent vs. depigmented).
