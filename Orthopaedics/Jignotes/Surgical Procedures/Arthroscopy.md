# Arthroscopy (Diagnostic and Therapeutic)

### Definition and Overview
[[Arthroscopy]] is a minimally invasive surgical procedure, often referred to as **"keyhole surgery"**. It involves the use of a specialized instrument called an **arthroscope** (a rigid telescope with fibreoptic illumination) to visualize the interior of a joint.
*   It allows for both **diagnostic** assessment and **therapeutic** surgical interventions through small incisions.
*   It transforms the joint from a "closed box" mystery into a clearly visualized structure.

### Instrumentation and Equipment
The basic setup requires specific "hardware" to function effectively:
*   **The Arthroscope:**
    *   Basically a rigid telescope containing a lens system and optical fibers.
    *   **Diameter:** Ranges from **1.9 mm or 2 mm** (small joints) to **4 mm** (knee/shoulder).
    *   **Viewing Angle:** Usually has a **30° forward oblique angle** at the distal end to increase the field of vision.
*   **Visual System:**
    *   **Light Source:** Transmitted via fiberoptic cable.
    *   **Camera:** A solid-state television camera is attached to the eyepiece.
    *   **Monitor:** Displays the magnified image of the joint interior.
*   **Irrigation System:**
    *   The joint must be distended with fluid (Saline or Ringer Lactate) to allow visualization and wash out debris.
*   **Hand Instruments:**
    *   **Probe:** The most vital instrument; acts as the "surgeon's extended finger" to palpate structures.
    *   **Scissors:** Small (3-4 mm) for cutting tissues.
    *   **Basket Forceps/Punch:** To punch out damaged tissue.
    *   **Motorized Shaver:** For debridement.

### Surgical Technique
**Anesthesia:**
*   Can be performed under **General**, **Spinal**, or regional block anesthesia.
*   In selected cases, it is possible under **Local Anesthesia**.

**Preparation:**
*   **Tourniquet:** Applied to the limb to ensure a bloodless field.
*   **Positioning:** Limb is positioned (e.g., leg holder for knee) to allow stress testing and access.

**Portals (The "Keyholes"):**
Instruments are introduced through small skin incisions called portals.
*   **Viewing Portal:** Usually **Anterolateral** (for the knee).
*   **Instrumentation Portal:** Usually **Anteromedial**.
*   **[[Triangulation]]:** This is the fundamental skill of arthroscopy. It involves bringing the tip of the working instrument into the field of view of the arthroscope so they meet at the target pathology.

### Indications
Arthroscopy is used for various joints including the **Knee** (most common), **Shoulder**, **Elbow**, **Wrist**, **Hip**, and **Ankle**.

#### 1. Diagnostic Indications
*   **Unexplained Symptoms:** Joint pain, swelling, or locking that persists despite conservative management.
*   **Equivocal Imaging:** When [[MRI]] is inconclusive or to confirm specific lesions (e.g., extent of chondral damage).
*   **[[Synovial Biopsy]]:** To diagnose inflammatory or infective conditions.
*   **Dynamic Assessment:** Evaluating joint tracking (e.g., patellar tracking) or stability under movement, which static MRI cannot do.

#### 2. Therapeutic Indications (Surgical)
| Structure | Procedures |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Meniscus]]** | • Partial or complete [[Meniscectomy]]<br>• Meniscal Repair (Meniscorrhaphy) |
| **[[Ligaments]]** | • Reconstruction (e.g., [[Anterior Cruciate Ligament]] reconstruction)<br>• Repair or Reinforcement |
| **[[Synovium]]** | • Synovectomy (e.g., in [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]])<br>• Excision of pathological plicae |
| **[[Articular Cartilage]]** | • Chondroplasty/Shaving<br>• Microfracturing<br>• Mosaicplasty |
| **Loose Bodies** | • Removal of loose bodies (chondral or osteochondral) |
| **Joint Capsule** | • Release of contractures (Arthrolysis)<br>• Capsular repair/stabilization (e.g., [[Bankart Repair]] for shoulder) |
| **Infection** | • Lavage and drainage of [[Septic Arthritis]] |

### Advantages of Arthroscopy
*   **Minimally Invasive:** Small incisions lead to barely visible scars.
*   **Low Morbidity:** Reduced postoperative pain and tissue trauma compared to open surgery (Arthrotomy).
*   **Rapid Recovery:** Shorter hospital stay (often day-care/outpatient) and faster return to work/sports.
*   **Diagnostic Accuracy:** Considered the "Gold Standard" or final word in diagnosis, superior to clinical exam and sometimes MRI.
*   **Access:** Ability to visualize deep and difficult-to-reach areas of the joint (e.g., posterior compartment of the knee).

### Limitations and Disadvantages
*   **Intra-articular Only:** Cannot visualize extra-articular pathologies or structures outside the joint capsule.
*   **Learning Curve:** Requires development of specific psychomotor skills (triangulation) and training.
*   **Cost:** Equipment is expensive to purchase and maintain.

### Complications
Although rare, complications can occur:
1.  **Infection:** Septic arthritis (rare due to continuous irrigation).
2.  **[[Hemarthrosis]]:** Bleeding into the joint post-operatively.
3.  **Neurovascular Injury:** Damage to nerves or vessels during portal creation.
4.  **Instrument Breakage:** Tips of small instruments may break inside the joint.
5.  **[[Compartment Syndrome]]:** Fluid extravasation into surrounding soft tissues during prolonged procedures.

**Clinical Implication:** In [[Tibial Plateau Fractures]], arthroscopy can aid in assessing the reduction of the articular surface and treating associated meniscal or ligamentous injuries, though care must be taken regarding fluid extravasation.
