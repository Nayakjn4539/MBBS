# Elbow Dislocation and The Terrible Triad

### **Introduction to Elbow Trauma**
The [[Elbow Joint]] is a stable hinge joint formed by the articulation of the distal [[Humerus]] with the proximal [[Radius]] and [[Ulna]]. It possesses inherent stability due to its bony congruity (ulnohumeral joint) and ligamentous support ([[Medial Collateral Ligament]] and [[Lateral Collateral Ligament]]).

Despite its stability, significant force can cause dislocation. When this dislocation is accompanied by specific fractures, it creates a highly unstable injury pattern known as the **Terrible Triad**.

### **Anatomy and Clinical Markers**

#### **Three Bony Point Relationship**
Understanding the normal relationship between bony landmarks is crucial for clinical diagnosis.
*   **Landmarks:** Tip of the [[Olecranon]], [[Medial Epicondyle]], and [[Lateral Epicondyle]].
*   **Normal Physiology:**
    *   **In Extension:** These three points lie in a **straight horizontal line**.
    *   **In 90° Flexion:** These points form an **isosceles triangle**.
*   **In Dislocation:** This relationship is **disturbed** (the triangle is distorted/reversed).
*   **In Supracondylar Fracture:** This relationship is **maintained** (the triangle shifts posteriorly but retains its shape).

### **Elbow Dislocation**

#### **Classification**
Dislocations are classified based on the position of the [[Ulna]] and [[Radius]] relative to the [[Humerus]].
1.  **Posterior:** Most common type (90%).
2.  **Posterior-Lateral:** Frequent.
3.  **Anterior:** Rare (associated with olecranon fracture).
4.  **Divergent:** Radius and Ulna dislocate in different directions (very rare).

#### **Mechanism of Injury**
*   **Fall on an Outstretched Hand (FOOSH):** The elbow is usually slightly flexed.
*   **Forces involved:** Axial compression + Valgus stress + Supination.
*   The forearm bones are levered out of the trochlea and capitulum.

#### **Clinical Features**
*   **Symptoms:** Severe pain, swelling, and inability to move the elbow.
*   **Inspection:**
    *   Gross deformity.
    *   The [[Olecranon]] is unusually prominent posteriorly.
    *   The forearm appears shortened.
    *   **Step Sign:** A step-off is palpable above the olecranon (supracondylar area).
*   **Palpation:** The three bony point relationship is disrupted.

#### **Imaging**
*   **X-Ray (AP and Lateral):** Confirm dislocation and direction.
    *   **Lateral View:** [[Olecranon]] lies posterior to the humerus; [[Radial Head]] is not aligned with the [[Capitulum]].
*   **CT Scan:** Essential to rule out associated fractures (Coronoid/Radial Head) if stability is questionable.

### **The Terrible Triad of the Elbow**

This is a complex injury pattern that is notoriously difficult to manage due to severe instability.

#### **Components (Definition)**
Also known as the **Hotchkiss Triad**, it consists of three specific injuries occurring simultaneously:
1.  **Posterior Dislocation of the Elbow**
2.  **Fracture of the [[Radial Head]]**
3.  **Fracture of the [[Coronoid Process]] of the Ulna**

**Clinical Implication:** The [[Radial Head]] acts as a secondary stabilizer against valgus stress, and the [[Coronoid Process]] is a key anterior stabilizer preventing posterior subluxation. Loss of both, combined with ligament tearing during dislocation, makes the elbow highly unstable.

#### **Pathomechanics**
The injury usually progresses from lateral to medial (Horii Circle concept):
1.  Disruption of the [[Lateral Collateral Ligament]] (LCL).
2.  Posterior dislocation occurs.
3.  The [[Radial Head]] fractures due to impaction against the [[Capitulum]].
4.  The [[Coronoid Process]] shears off as the ulna dislocates posteriorly.
5.  Finally, the [[Medial Collateral Ligament]] (MCL) may tear.

### **Management**

#### **1. Simple Posterior Dislocation (No Fractures)**
*   **Closed Reduction:** Performed under sedation or general anesthesia.
    *   **Traction and Counter-traction:** Assistant applies counter-traction to the arm. Surgeon applies traction to the forearm in slight flexion.
    *   **Maneuver:** Correct medial/lateral displacement first, then push the [[Olecranon]] forward while gently flexing the elbow. A "clunk" indicates reduction.
*   **Post-Reduction:** Check neurovascular status. Immobilize in a posterior slab (elbow at 90°) for **3 weeks**. Early mobilization is key to preventing stiffness.

#### **2. Management of Terrible Triad (Surgical)**
This is a **"Fracture of Necessity"** (requires surgery). Conservative management usually leads to re-dislocation or severe arthritis.

**Principles of Surgery:**
*   **Goal:** Restore the stabilizing structures to convert an unstable joint into a stable one that allows early motion.
*   **Sequence of Fixation:**
    1.  **Fix or Replace [[Radial Head]]:** If comminuted, replace with a metal prosthesis. If amenable, fix with screws. (Avoid excision of radial head in triad injuries as it leads to gross instability).
    2.  **Fix [[Coronoid Process]]:** Using sutures, anchors, or screws depending on fragment size.
    3.  **Repair Ligaments:** Repair the [[Lateral Collateral Ligament]] (LCL) complex.
    4.  **External Fixator:** May be applied if stability is still doubtful after internal fixation.

### **Complications**

| Complication | Details | Clinical Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stiffness** | **Most common complication.** Due to capsular fibrosis and prolonged immobilization. | Early mobilization is the best prevention. |
| **Myositis Ossificans** | Heterotopic bone formation in muscles (commonly [[Brachialis]]). | **Massage is contraindicated** as it precipitates this condition. Treatment involves rest and NSAIDs initially; surgical excision only when the mass matures. |
| **Nerve Injury** | **[[Ulnar Nerve]]** is most commonly injured (neurapraxia). [[Median Nerve]] or [[Radial Nerve]] can also be involved. | Document neurological status pre- and post-reduction. |
| **Recurrent Instability** | Due to inadequate healing of LCL or non-union of coronoid. | Seen more often in Terrible Triad. |
| **Vascular Injury** | [[Brachial Artery]] damage. | Check radial pulse immediately. |
| **Compartment Syndrome** | Due to severe swelling or tight plaster. | Monitor for pain on passive stretch (Volkmann's Ischemia). |
