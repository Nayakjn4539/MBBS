# [[Diseases Of Lens]] > Maturity of Cataract

# Maturity of Cataract (Stages of Senile Cortical Cataract)

The progression of [[Senile Cortical Cataract]] is classically divided into stages of maturity based on the extent of opacification of the lens cortex and the hydration status of the lens.

### 1. Stage of Lamellar Separation (Early Stage)
*   **Pathophysiology:** This is the earliest sign. There is hydration of the lens leading to the formation of water clefts and vacuoles in the anterior and posterior cortex.
*   **Clinical Finding:** Demarcation of cortical fibers due to separation by fluid.
*   **Reversibility:** These changes are initially reversible.

### 2. Stage of Incipient Cataract
*   **Morphology:** Early detectable opacities appear with clear areas in between.
    *   **[[Cuneiform Cataract]]:** Wedge-shaped opacities (radial spokes) extending from the equator towards the center. Most common in the lower nasal quadrant.
    *   **[[Cupuliform Cataract]]:** Saucer-shaped opacity just below the capsule (Posterior Subcapsular Cataract).
*   **Visual Symptoms:**
    *   **Uniocular Polyopia:** Doubling or trebling of objects due to irregular refraction.
    *   **Glare:** Intolerance to bright light.

### 3. Immature Senile Cataract (ISC)
*   **Pathophysiology:** Opacification progresses but is not complete. There is still **clear cortex** present between the iris and the lens opacity.
*   **Clinical Signs:**
    *   **Color:** The lens appears greyish-white.
    *   **[[Iris Shadow Test]]:** **Positive**. When an oblique beam of light is thrown, a crescentic shadow of the pupillary margin of the iris is formed on the greyish opacity because clear cortex separates them.
    *   **Fundus:** Black spots against a red fundal glow.
    *   **Visual Acuity:** Ranges from 6/9 to Counting Fingers (CF).

#### Variant: [[Intumescent Cataract]]
*   **Definition:** A swollen lens due to continued hydration and fluid accumulation.
*   **Signs:**
    *   Lens becomes swollen/intumescent.
    *   **Anterior Chamber (AC):** Becomes shallow.
    *   **Iris Shadow:** Distinctly visible.
*   **Clinical Implication:** Can lead to **[[Phacomorphic Glaucoma]]** (Secondary Angle Closure Glaucoma) due to pupillary block by the swollen lens.

### 4. Mature Senile Cataract (MSC)
*   **Pathophysiology:** Opacification is complete. The entire cortex is involved.
*   **Clinical Signs:**
    *   **Color:** Pearly white or "Ripe" cataract.
    *   **Iris Shadow Test:** **Absent**. The opacity reaches the anterior capsule; thus, the iris rests directly on the opacity, casting no shadow.
    *   **Fundus:** No red glow is seen.
    *   **Visual Acuity:** Restricted to Hand Movements (HM) or Perception of Light (PL).

### 5. Hypermature Senile Cataract (HMSC)
If a mature cataract is left untreated, it progresses to hypermaturity. It presents in two distinct forms:

#### A. [[Morgagnian Cataract]] (Liquefactive Type)
*   **Pathophysiology:** The cortex liquefies and converts into a milky fluid. The small brownish nucleus sinks to the bottom of the capsular bag.
*   **Clinical Signs:**
    *   **Appearance:** "Bag of milky fluid".
    *   **Sinking Nucleus:** The nucleus alters position with the change in head position.
    *   **Semicircular Line:** The upper border of the sunken nucleus is seen as a semicircular line.
*   **Complications:**
    *   **[[Phacolytic Glaucoma]]:** Leakage of lens proteins through the capsule causes secondary open-angle glaucoma (macrophages clog the trabecular meshwork).
    *   **Phacoanaphylactic Uveitis:** Immune reaction to leaked lens protein.

#### B. Sclerotic Cataract (Shrunken Type)
*   **Pathophysiology:** The cortex disintegrates and absorbs (inspissated). The lens shrinks due to water leakage.
*   **Clinical Signs:**
    *   **Anterior Capsule:** Wrinkled and thickened.
    *   **Anterior Chamber:** Becomes deep.
    *   **Iris:** Tremulous iris ([[Iridodonesis]]) due to lack of lens support.
    *   **Calcification:** White spots of calcific deposits may appear.
*   **Complications:** Subluxation or dislocation of the lens due to zonular degeneration.

### Comparison of Cataract Maturity Stages

| Feature | Immature (ISC) | Mature (MSC) | Hypermature (Morgagnian) | Hypermature (Sclerotic) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Visual Acuity** | 6/9 to Counting Fingers | HM to PL+ | PL+ | PL+ |
| **Lens Color** | Greyish White | Pearly White | Milky White | Dirty White / Calcified |
| **Iris Shadow** | **Present** | **Absent** | Absent | Absent |
| **Anterior Chamber** | Normal or Shallow (Intumescent) | Normal | Normal or Deep | Deep |
| **Fundus Glow** | Black spots on red glow | No red glow | No red glow | No red glow |
| **Complication Risk** | [[Phacomorphic Glaucoma]] | - | [[Phacolytic Glaucoma]] | Subluxation |

### Clinical Implications & Management

*   **Intumescent Cataract:** Requires urgent attention to prevent secondary angle-closure glaucoma.
    *   **Argentinian Flag Sign:** A specific sign during capsulorrhexis in intumescent cataract where the capsule splits, resembling the flag (blue dye - white cortex - blue dye).
*   **Morgagnian Cataract:** Indicates a fragile capsule. Surgical risks include [[Posterior Capsular Rupture]] (PCR) or nucleus drop.
*   **Surgical Timing:** Modern surgery (Phacoemulsification) is preferred at the **Immature** stage to prevent hardening of the nucleus and complications associated with hypermaturity.
