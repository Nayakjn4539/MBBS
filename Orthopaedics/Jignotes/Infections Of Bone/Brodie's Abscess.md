# [[Infections Of Bone]] > Brodie's Abscess

# Brodie's Abscess (Subacute Osteomyelitis)

**Brodie's Abscess** is a specific localized form of **subacute osteomyelitis** which presents as a chronic bone abscess. It represents a contained infection where the body's defense mechanisms have successfully walled off the infectious focus, creating a stalemate between the organism and the host.

It was first described by **Sir Benjamin Brodie** in 1832.

### Etiopathogenesis
The condition occurs due to a delicate balance between the virulence of the organism and the resistance of the host.
*   **Organism:** Usually a low-virulence strain of [[Staphylococcus aureus]] (found in >50% of cases). Other organisms may include *Proteus*, *Pseudomonas*, or *Klebsiella*.
*   **Host Factors:** The patient typically possesses high resistance/good immunity.
*   **Mechanism:** The infection is contained locally by a wall of fibrous tissue and sclerotic bone, preventing the spread of pus into the subperiosteal space or joint.

### Epidemiology
*   **Age:** Commonly affects children and young adults (typically **11–20 years**; range 5–25 years).
*   **Sex:** Males are affected more frequently than females (**2:1 ratio**).
*   **Site:**
    *   Predominantly affects the **Metaphysis** of long bones.
    *   Most common site: **Proximal or Distal [[Tibia]]**.
    *   Other sites: Distal [[Femur]], Proximal Humerus, Distal Radius.
    *   It rarely crosses the [[Physis]] (growth plate).

### Pathology
The lesion consists of a central cavity filled with:
1.  **Pus** (often frank pus).
2.  **Granulation tissue** (jelly-like).
3.  **Sequestra:** Rarely contains a sequestrum; if present, it is usually soft and cortical.

**Surrounding Structure:** The cavity is lined by inflammatory granulation tissue and surrounded by a thick, dense zone of **osteosclerosis** (reactive new bone formation).

### Clinical Features
The onset is typically insidious.
1.  **Pain:** The hallmark symptom. It is deep, boring, and intermittent. Often worse at night (mimicking [[Osteoid Osteoma]]).
2.  **Swelling:** A localized bony enlargement or thickening may be palpable.
3.  **Tenderness:** Deep tenderness over the affected metaphysis.
4.  **Systemic Signs:** Usually **absent**. No high-grade fever, chills, or acute toxicity.
5.  **History:** May have a history of antecedent trauma or a previous treated acute infection.

> **Clinical Implication:** Because the symptoms are mild and intermittent, patients often present late, sometimes months or years after the onset.

### Investigations

#### 1. Laboratory Findings
*   **WBC Count:** Usually normal.
*   **ESR/CRP:** May be elevated in the active phase but can be normal.
*   **Blood Culture:** Usually negative.

#### 2. Radiology (X-ray)
The radiographic appearance is often diagnostic.
*   **Lytic Lesion:** A central circular or oval radiolucent area (cavity) usually < 2 cm.
*   **Sclerotic Rim:** The cavity is surrounded by a distinct, dense zone of bony sclerosis (white margin).
*   **Location:** Central or eccentric location within the **metaphysis**.
*   **Periosteal Reaction:** Minimal or absent (unlike acute osteomyelitis).

#### 3. Advanced Imaging
*   **[[CT Scan]]:** Excellent for defining the cavity size, cortical integrity, and presence of any small sequestrum.
*   **[[MRI]]:** Most sensitive.
    *   **Penumbra Sign:** A characteristic feature on T1-weighted images appearing as a discrete zone of transition (lining granulation tissue) with higher signal intensity than the abscess cavity but lower than the fatty marrow.
    *   Shows extensive marrow edema surrounding the lesion.

### Differential Diagnosis
It is crucial to differentiate Brodie's Abscess from other lytic bone lesions.

| Condition | Differentiating Features |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Osteoid Osteoma]]** | Pain is dramatic, worse at night, and relieved specifically by **Aspirin**. X-ray shows a small *nidus* (<1cm) rather than a larger cavity. |
| **[[Eosinophilic Granuloma]]** | "Hole within a hole" appearance; skeletal survey may show punched-out lesions elsewhere. |
| **[[Chondroblastoma]]** | Typically **epiphyseal** lesion (Brodie's is metaphyseal). Stippled calcification may be seen. |
| **[[Tubercular Osteomyelitis]]** | Cavity is usually larger, sclerosis is less marked, and systemic signs of TB may be present. |
| **[[Ewing's Sarcoma]]** | Aggressive periosteal reaction ("onion-peel"), large soft tissue mass, systemic symptoms. |
| **Cystic Bone Lesions** | [[Unicameral Bone Cyst]] or [[Aneurysmal Bone Cyst]] usually lack the dense sclerotic rim and pain is uncommon unless fractured. |

### Treatment

#### 1. Conservative Management
*   **Indications:** If the diagnosis is certain, the lesion is small, and symptoms are mild.
*   **Regimen:** Rest and appropriate **Antibiotics** (IV followed by oral) for **6 weeks**.
*   **Antibiotics:** Flucloxacillin and Fusidic acid (targeting Staph. aureus).

#### 2. Surgical Management
*   **Indications:** Large cavities, failure of conservative therapy, persistent pain, or doubt in diagnosis (requires biopsy).
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  **Biopsy:** Tissue sent for culture/sensitivity and histopathology (to rule out tumor).
    2.  **Curettage:** Thorough evacuation of the pus and scraping of the cavity wall (granulation tissue).
    3.  **Saucerization:** If the cavity is superficial.
    4.  **Bone Grafting:** The defect is packed with **cancellous bone chips** to obliterate the dead space and promote healing.
    5.  **Antibiotic Beads:** In some cases, antibiotic-impregnated polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) beads are placed.
