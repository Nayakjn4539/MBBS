# Acute Laryngitis

[[Acute Laryngitis]] is an acute inflammation of the [[laryngeal mucosa]] which may occur as a standalone condition or as a manifestation of a generalized [[upper respiratory tract infection]]. It can be infectious or non-infectious in origin.

## Etiology and Risk Factors

The causes can be broadly classified into infectious and non-infectious agents.

### 1. Infectious Causes
*   **Viral (Most Common):** The condition is usually viral in origin. Common agents include:
    *   [[Rhinovirus]]
    *   [[Adenovirus]]
    *   [[Parainfluenza virus]]
    *   [[Respiratory Syncytial Virus]] (RSV)
    *   [[Influenza virus]]
    *   [[Corona virus]]
*   **Bacterial:** Often occurs as a secondary superinfection.
    *   *Streptococcus pneumoniae*
    *   *Haemophilus influenzae*
    *   *Moraxella catarrhalis*
    *   *Staphylococcus aureus*
    *   Hemolytic streptococci
*   **Exanthematous Fevers:** Associated with [[measles]], [[chickenpox]], and [[whooping cough]].

### 2. Non-Infectious / Reactive Causes
*   **Vocal Abuse:** Sudden shouting or overuse of voice.
*   **Environmental Irritants:** Smoking, alcohol, dust, and chemical fumes.
*   **Trauma:** Thermal or chemical burns (inhalation/ingestion), [[endotracheal intubation]], or endoscopic procedures.
*   **Allergy:** Allergic reaction causing laryngeal inflammation.
*   **Gastroesophageal Reflux:** [[Laryngopharyngeal reflux]] (LPR).

### Pathogenesis
1.  **Hyperemia:** Vasodilatation and hyperemia of the laryngeal mucosa.
2.  **Edema:** Generalized extracellular/interstitial edema.
3.  **Exudation:** Sticky mucopurulent exudate forms.
4.  **Epithelial Damage:** Superficial abrasions or ulcerations may occur.

## Clinical Features

The severity varies; symptoms are often more severe in children due to the smaller airway.

### Symptoms
*   **Hoarseness:** The cardinal symptom. Can range from huskiness to complete [[aphonia]] (loss of voice).
*   **Throat Discomfort:** Sensation of rawness, dryness, or pain, particularly after talking.
*   **Cough:** Dry, irritating, and painful cough, often worse at night.
*   **Constitutional Symptoms:** Fever, malaise, and headache (usually if viral etiology).
*   **Dysphonia:** Difficulty in speaking.
*   **Voice Fatigue:** Known as [[phonasthenia]].

### Signs (On Examination)
Examination is typically done via **Indirect Laryngoscopy (IDL)** or **Flexible Fiberoptic Laryngoscopy**.

| Stage | Laryngoscopic Findings |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Early Stage** | Erythema and edema of [[epiglottis]], [[aryepiglottic folds]], [[arytenoids]], and [[ventricular bands]]. The [[vocal cords]] may initially appear white and normal in contrast to surrounding hyperemia. |
| **Later Stage** | Vocal cords become red, swollen, and lose their sharp demarcation. Edema may involve the [[subglottis]]. |
| **Secretions** | Sticky, viscid secretions seen bridging between the cords or in the interarytenoid region. |
| **Hemorrhage** | Submucosal hemorrhages may be visible on the vocal cords in cases of severe vocal abuse. |

## Diagnosis

*   **Clinical Diagnosis:** Diagnosis is primarily based on the history of recent URTI or vocal abuse and clinical presentation.
*   **Laryngoscopy:**
    *   **Indirect Laryngoscopy (IDL):** Reveals congestion and edema.
    *   **Fiberoptic Laryngoscopy:** Shows erythema progressing to edema.

## Management

The condition is usually self-limiting, lasting 3–7 days. Treatment aims to relieve symptoms and prevent complications like chronic laryngitis.

### 1. Non-Medical Management
*   **Vocal Rest (Absolute):** This is the single most important factor. Use of voice during acute inflammation delays recovery and may lead to permanent damage.
*   **Avoidance of Irritants:** Cessation of [[smoking]] and alcohol consumption.
*   **Steam Inhalation:** Inhalation with Tincture Benzoin Co., menthol, or oil of eucalyptus helps loosen viscid secretions and soothes the mucosa.
*   **Hydration:** Adequate fluid intake.

### 2. Medical Management
*   **Analgesics/Antipyretics:** For relief of pain and fever.
*   **Cough Suppressants:** To control dry, irritating cough (e.g., linctus codeine).
*   **Mucolytics:** Agents like bromhexine to liquefy secretions.
*   **Antibiotics:** Indicated only if there is evidence of secondary bacterial infection (purulent expectoration, high fever, toxemia). Common choices include Ampicillin or Amoxicillin.
*   **Steroids:** Systemic steroids are restricted for specific cases like thermal/chemical burns or severe edema compromising the airway.

**Clinical Implications:**
> **Warning:** Failure to observe strict voice rest during the acute phase can lead to incomplete recovery and progression to **[[Chronic Laryngitis]]** or formation of **[[Vocal Nodules]]**.

## Acute Membranous Laryngitis
This is a specific subtype caused by pyogenic non-specific organisms.
*   **Features:** Similar to acute membranous tonsillitis.
*   **Differentiation:** Must be distinguished from **[[Laryngeal Diphtheria]]**.

**Mnemonic for Management:** **"VAPOR"**
*   **V** - **V**oice Rest (Absolute)
*   **A** - **A**nalgesics/Antibiotics (if bacterial)
*   **P** - **P**revent Irritants (Smoke/Alcohol)
*   **O** - **O**il of Eucalyptus/Steam
*   **R** - **R**ehydration
