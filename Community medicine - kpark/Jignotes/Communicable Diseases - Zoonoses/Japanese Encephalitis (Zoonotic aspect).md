# [[Communicable Diseases - Zoonoses]] > Japanese Encephalitis (Zoonotic aspect)

### **Japanese Encephalitis (JE)**

**Japanese Encephalitis (JE)** is a mosquito-borne [[viral encephalitis]] caused by Group B arbovirus (Flavivirus). It is a classic example of a **zoonotic disease** affecting mainly animals, with humans acting as incidental hosts,.

#### **1. Epidemiological Determinants**

*   **Agent Factor:**
    *   **Causative Agent:** JE Virus (RNA virus).
    *   **Family:** Flaviviridae (Group B Arbovirus).
    *   **Antigenic Relation:** Close antigenic relationship with West Nile and [[Dengue]] viruses.

*   **Vector:**
    *   **Type:** Culicine mosquitoes.
    *   **Primary Vector:** ***Culex tritaeniorhynchus***.
    *   **Other Vectors:** *Culex vishnui*, *Culex gelidus*.
    *   **Habits:** These are zoophilic (prefer animals), **outdoor resters** (exophilic), and breed in irrigated rice fields (paddy fields),.

*   **Host Factors (Zoonotic Cycle):**
    *   **Reservoir/Maintenance Hosts:** **Ardeid birds** (e.g., pond herons, cattle egrets) and ducks. They maintain the virus in nature.
    *   **Amplifier Hosts:** **Pigs**. Pigs do not show overt symptoms but develop high viremia, infecting mosquitoes. They act as "amplifiers" of the virus,.
    *   **Incidental/Dead-End Hosts:** **Man**. Humans do not develop sufficient viremia to infect mosquitoes.
    *   **Mosquito Attractants:** Cattle and buffaloes act as attractants but are not natural hosts.

| Host Type | Animal/Bird | Role in JE Cycle |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Reservoir** | Ardeid Birds (Herons, Egrets) | Maintain virus in nature |
| **Amplifier** | **Pigs** | Multiply virus; infect mosquitoes |
| **Dead-End** | **Humans**, Horses | Do not transmit to mosquitoes |

#### **2. Transmission**

*   **Mode:** Bite of an infected culicine mosquito.
*   **Transmission Cycles:**
    1.  **Pig — Mosquito — Pig** (Basic cycle).
    2.  **Bird — Mosquito — Bird**.
    3.  **Mosquito — Man** (Incidental).
*   **Human-to-Human Transmission:** **No**. Man is a dead-end host. The virus is not transmitted from person to person,.
*   **Seasonality:** Transmission intensifies during the rainy season (monsoon).

#### **3. Incubation Period**
*   **In Man:** **5 to 15 days**,.
*   **Extrinsic Incubation (in mosquito):** 9 to 12 days.

#### **4. Clinical Picture**

*   **Iceberg Phenomenon:** The ratio of overt disease to inapparent infection is **1:300 to 1:1000**,.
*   **Prodromal Stage (1–6 days):** Acute onset of fever, headache, malaise, and GI disturbances.
*   **Acute Encephalitic Stage:**
    *   High fever ($38^{\circ}C - 40.7^{\circ}C$).
    *   **Nuchal rigidity** (Neck stiffness).
    *   Convulsions and focal CNS signs.
    *   Altered sensorium progressing to coma.
    *   **Mask-like face** and coarse tremors (Extra-pyramidal signs).
*   **Late Stage/Sequelae:** Neurological deficits, parkinsonism, and behavioral changes in survivors.
*   **Case Fatality Rate (CFR):** 20–40%.

#### **5. Diagnosis**

*   **IgM Capture ELISA:** Detects specific IgM in **CSF** or blood within 7 days of onset (Standard diagnostic test),.
*   **Paired Sera:** Demonstration of a significant rise in antibody titre.
*   **Note:** Isolation of the virus from blood is rare in humans.

#### **6. Treatment**

*   There is **no specific antiviral drug** for JE.
*   Management is **symptomatic and supportive**:
    *   Fluid and electrolyte balance.
    *   Control of convulsions.
    *   Reduction of intracranial pressure (e.g., Mannitol).
    *   Airway maintenance.

#### **7. Prevention and Control**

**A. Vaccination (Primary Prevention)**
*   **SA 14-14-2 Vaccine:**
    *   **Type:** **Live attenuated** cell culture-derived vaccine,.
    *   **Dose:** 0.5 ml.
    *   **Route:** Subcutaneous (SC).
    *   **Schedule (NIS):** Two doses.
        *   1st Dose: 9–12 months (with Measles-Rubella).
        *   2nd Dose: 16–24 months (with DPT booster),.
*   **Other Vaccines:** Inactivated Mouse Brain (Nakayama strain) - largely replaced; Inactivated Cell Culture (Beijing strain).

**B. Vector Control**
*   **Fogging:** Aerial or ground fogging with **Malathion** (ULV) for immediate outbreak control.
*   **Personal Protection:** Use of [[Insecticide Treated Bed Nets]] (ITBN), long-sleeved clothes.
*   **Larvicidal:** Use of larvivorous fish or biocides in rice fields.
*   *Note:* Indoor Residual Spray (IRS) is **not effective** because vectors are exophilic (outdoor resters).

**C. Control of Animal Hosts (Pigs)**
*   Segregation of pigs from human dwellings (pigs should be kept in pigsties).
*   Vaccination of pigs (though difficult due to rapid population turnover).

**D. Surveillance**
*   JE cases are reported under the umbrella of **Acute Encephalitis Syndrome ([[AES]])**.

### **Mnemonics**

*   **JE Hosts:**
    *   **P**igs = **P**ropagators (**A**mplifiers)
    *   **B**irds = **B**ase (**R**eservoir)
    *   **M**an = **M**issing link (**D**ead-end)
*   **Vector:** **C**ulex **T**ritaeniorhynchus causes issues that need a **CT** scan (Brain).
