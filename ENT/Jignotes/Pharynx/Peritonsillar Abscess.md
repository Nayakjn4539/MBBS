# [[Pharynx]] > Peritonsillar Abscess

# [[Peritonsillar Abscess]] (Quinsy)

### Definition and Anatomy
**Definition:**
*   A collection of pus in the **[[peritonsillar space]]**, which lies between the fibrous capsule of the [[palatine tonsil]] medially and the [[superior constrictor muscle]] laterally,.
*   It is the most common deep neck space abscess.

**Anatomy of Peritonsillar Space:**
*   **Medial Boundary:** Capsule of the [[tonsil]].
*   **Lateral Boundary:** [[Superior constrictor muscle]] (covered by buccopharyngeal fascia), .
*   **Anterior Boundary:** Anterior [[tonsillar pillar]] ([[palatoglossus muscle]]).
*   **Posterior Boundary:** Posterior [[tonsillar pillar]] ([[palatopharyngeus muscle]]).
*   **Contents:** Loose areolar tissue and the **[[external palatine vein]]** (paratonsillar vein),.

### Etiology and Pathogenesis
**Etiology:**
*   Usually follows an attack of **[[acute tonsillitis]]**,.
*   Can arise *de novo* without a previous history of sore throat.
*   More common in adults (2nd and 3rd decades) than children (tonsils become atrophic in adults, allowing crypts to reach the capsule),.
*   Almost always **unilateral**,.

**Pathogenesis:**
1.  Infection of the tonsillar crypts, usually the **[[crypta magna]]** (the largest and deepest crypt),.
2.  The crypt gets sealed off, forming an **[[intratonsillar abscess]]**.
3.  The abscess bursts through the tonsillar capsule into the [[peritonsillar space]].
4.  Development of **peritonsillitis** (cellulitis) followed by frank abscess formation.
*   *Note:* Recent studies suggest the initial infection may start in the **[[supratonsillar space]]** or Weber's glands.

**Microbiology:**
Usually **polymicrobial** (mixed aerobic and anaerobic),.
*   **Aerobes:**
    *   *[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]* (Group A Beta-hemolytic Streptococcus) - Most common,.
    *   *[[Staphylococcus aureus]]*.
    *   *[[Haemophilus influenzae]]*.
*   **Anaerobes:** (Associated with periodontal disease).
    *   *[[Fusobacterium]]*.
    *   *[[Bacteroides]]*.
    *   *[[Peptostreptococcus]]*.

### Clinical Features
**Symptoms:**
*   **General:** High-grade **fever** (up to 104°F) with chills/rigors, malaise, headache, nausea, constipation,.
*   **Pain:** Acute, severe, unilateral throat pain.
*   **[[Odynophagia]]:** Marked difficulty in swallowing, often leading to dehydration,.
*   **Drooling:** Due to inability to swallow saliva,.
*   **"Hot Potato" Voice:** Thick, muffled speech due to palatal edema and pain,.
*   **[[Trismus]]:** Difficulty opening the mouth due to spasm of the **[[medial pterygoid muscle]]** (which lies close to the superior constrictor),.
*   **Referred [[Otalgia]]:** Earache on the affected side via the **[[glossopharyngeal nerve]]** (CN IX),.
*   **Halitosis:** Foul breath due to oral sepsis.

**Signs:**
*   **[[Tonsil]]:** Displaced **inferomedially** (downwards and medially); may be buried behind edematous pillars,.
*   **[[Uvula]]:** Edematous and **deviated to the opposite (healthy) side**,,.
*   **Soft Palate/Pillars:** Congestion and bulging of the soft palate and anterior pillar superior to the tonsil.
*   **Cervical Lymphadenopathy:** Enlarged, tender **[[jugulodigastric lymph nodes]]**,.
*   **Torticollis:** Neck tilted towards the side of the abscess to relax neck muscles.
*   **Mucopus:** May cover the tonsillar region.

**Mnemonic for Symptoms: "HOT POTATO"**
*   **H**ot potato voice
*   **O**dynophagia
*   **T**rismus
*   **P**ain (severe, unilateral)
*   **O**talgia (referred)
*   **T**onsil displaced medially
*   **A**bscess (bulge)
*   **T**orticollis
*   **O**pposite deviation of uvula

### Diagnosis
*   Primarily a **clinical diagnosis** based on history and physical examination (trismus, uvula deviation, peritonsillar bulge).
*   **Needle Aspiration:** Pus aspiration confirms the diagnosis and provides material for culture/sensitivity,.
*   **Imaging:**
    *   **[[CT Scan]] with contrast:** Differentiates between cellulitis and abscess; defines extent; rules out deep neck space extension (e.g., parapharyngeal spread),.
    *   **Intraoral Ultrasound:** Can distinguish abscess from cellulitis.

**Differential Diagnosis:**
| Condition | Differentiating Features |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Peritonsillar Cellulitis** | Early stage; no frank pus on aspiration; responds to antibiotics alone. |
| **[[Parapharyngeal Abscess]]** | Tonsil pushed medially but **lateral pharyngeal wall** also involved; bulging at the **angle of the jaw** or upper 1/3 of sternocleidomastoid; **prolapse of tonsil**,,. |
| **Dental Abscess** | History of dental caries; localizes to gingiva/jaw. |
| **Tumors** | [[Lymphoma]] or [[Squamous Cell Carcinoma]]; slower onset; no acute fever; firm/hard consistency; usually older adults,. |
| **[[Retropharyngeal Abscess]]** | Posterior pharyngeal wall bulge; stridor; more common in children,. |
| **Internal Carotid Aneurysm** | Pulsatile mass; must be ruled out before incision. |

### Management

#### 1. Medical Management
*   **Hospitalization:** For patients with severe dysphagia or dehydration.
*   **IV Fluids:** To correct dehydration.
*   **Antibiotics:** High-dose IV antibiotics covering aerobes and anaerobes (e.g., Penicillin/Cephalosporin + Metronidazole),.
*   **Analgesics:** To relieve pain and fever (Avoid aspirin due to bleeding risk).
*   **Oral Hygiene:** Hydrogen peroxide or saline mouthwashes.

#### 2. Surgical Management
If a frank abscess is formed, drainage is required.

**A. Incision and Drainage (I & D):**
*   **Anesthesia:** Local anesthesia (spray or injection).
*   **Position:** Sitting upright to prevent aspiration of pus.
*   **Site of Incision:**
    1.  Point of **maximum bulge** above the upper pole of the tonsil.
    2.  **Intersection Method:** Where a horizontal imaginary line through the base of the [[uvula]] meets a vertical line through the [[anterior tonsillar pillar]],.
*   **Technique:**
    *   A small stab incision is made with a **guarded knife** (Quinsy knife or blade taped to expose only 1 cm tip) to prevent deep injury to major vessels,.
    *   **[[Sinus forceps]]** or [[hemostat]] is inserted and opened to break loculations and drain pus.
    *   Procedure may need repetition the next day.

**B. Wide-bore Needle Aspiration:**
*   Diagnostic and therapeutic; may be sufficient for small abscesses.

**C. [[Tonsillectomy]]:**
1.  **Interval Tonsillectomy:**
    *   Performed **4–6 weeks** after the acute abscess has resolved,.
    *   **Indications:** Recurrent quinsy; children (after 1st episode), adults (after 2nd episode),.
2.  **Abscess Tonsillectomy (Hot Tonsillectomy):**
    *   Tonsillectomy performed *during* the acute abscess stage.
    *   **Advantages:** Drains abscess immediately; avoids second admission/surgery.
    *   **Disadvantages:** Risk of rupture/aspiration during anesthesia; increased bleeding risk due to hyperemia,.

#### Clinical Implications:
> **Warning:** Never attempt I&D if the swelling is pulsatile (aneurysm) or if the diagnosis is unclear (tumor). Always guard the knife to prevent injury to the [[internal carotid artery]] or [[internal jugular vein]] located posterolaterally.

### Complications
Although rare with modern antibiotics, complications can be severe,:
1.  **[[Parapharyngeal Abscess]]:** Extension of infection laterally through the superior constrictor.
2.  **[[Laryngeal Edema]]:** Leading to airway obstruction; may require [[tracheostomy]].
3.  **[[Pneumonitis]]/Lung Abscess:** Due to spontaneous rupture and aspiration of pus.
4.  **[[Septicemia]]:** Can lead to endocarditis, nephritis, or brain abscess.
5.  **[[Jugular Vein Thrombosis]]** (Lemierre’s Syndrome): Septic thrombophlebitis of the IJV.
6.  **Hemorrhage:** From erosion of the carotid artery or jugular vein.
