# [[HEALTH PROGRAMMES IN INDIA]] > A 2-year-old male child presented at the immunisation clinic with weight between 2SD and -3SD for his age. What measures will you take for his management under the ICDS scheme? Enumerate the beneficiaries under the scheme. Discuss the services provided under this scheme.

### Management of the Child Under ICDS Scheme

**Case Assessment:**
A 2-year-old male child with weight between **-2SD and -3SD** falls into the **Yellow Zone** on the [[WHO Growth Chart]].
*   **Diagnosis:** **Moderately Underweight** (Mild to Moderate Malnutrition).
*   **Target:** Prevent progression to Severe Acute Malnutrition (Red Zone/ < -3SD) and promote catch-up growth.

**Management Measures:**

1.  **Nutritional Support (Supplementary Nutrition):**
    *   Since the child is < 3 years old, he should be provided with **[[Take Home Ration (THR)]]**.
    *   **Nutritional Norms:** He must receive **500 Calories** and **12-15 grams of Protein** per day for 300 days in a year.
2.  **Growth Monitoring:**
    *   The [[Anganwadi Worker (AWW)]] must weigh the child **monthly** and plot the weight on the growth chart to monitor the trajectory.
    *   **Goal:** Upward trend of the growth curve.
3.  **Health Interventions:**
    *   **Deworming:** Administer **Albendazole** (400 mg or age-appropriate dose) if not given recently (biannual).
    *   **Vitamin A Prophylaxis:** Check immunization card; ensure age-appropriate [[Vitamin A]] dosing.
    *   **Treat Infections:** Assess for diarrhea or ARI. If diarrhea is present, provide **ORS and Zinc**.
4.  **Nutrition and Health Education (Counseling):**
    *   Educate the mother on **Home Based Nutritional Care**.
    *   Focus on energy-dense complementary feeding using locally available foods.
    *   Counsel on hygiene and sanitation to prevent recurrent infections.
