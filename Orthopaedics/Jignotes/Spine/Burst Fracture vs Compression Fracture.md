# Burst Fracture vs. Compression Fracture of the Spine

### Introduction to Spinal Column Stability
To understand the difference between these two fractures, one must understand the **Denis Three Column Concept** of spinal stability.

*   **[[Anterior Column]]:** Anterior longitudinal ligament, anterior annulus, and anterior 2/3 of the vertebral body,.
*   **[[Middle Column]]:** Posterior 1/3 of the vertebral body, posterior annulus, and posterior longitudinal ligament,.
*   **[[Posterior Column]]:** Posterior osseous arch (pedicles, laminae, facets, spinous process) and posterior ligament complex,.

### Comparison Table: Compression vs. Burst Fracture

| Feature | [[Compression Fracture]] (Wedge) | [[Burst Fracture]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mechanism of Injury** | **Flexion** force,. Often low energy (e.g., osteoporosis) or trauma. | **Axial Compression** / [[Axial Loading]],,. High energy (e.g., fall from height, RTA). |
| **Columns Involved** | **Anterior Column** failure only,. | **Anterior + Middle Columns** failure,. |
| **Vertebral Body Morphology** | **Wedging** of the anterior aspect. The posterior height is maintained,. | **Comminution** of the vertebral body. Loss of both anterior and posterior height,. |
| **Posterior Wall** | **Intact**,. | **Damaged/Retropulsed**. Fragments displaced into the spinal canal,. |
| **Spinal Stability** | Generally **Stable** (unless >50% loss of height),. | Usually **Unstable**,. |
| **Neurological Deficit** | **Rare** (Spinal canal is not compromised). | **Common** (Due to retropulsion of bone fragments),. |
| **X-ray Features** | Loss of anterior vertebral height (Wedging). | Splaying of vertebral body; **Widening of interpedicular distance**. |

### Detailed Analysis: Wedge Compression Fracture

#### 1. Mechanism and Pathology
*   Occurs due to a pure **flexion injury**.
*   The spine bends forward, causing the anterior column to collapse under pressure, while the middle and posterior columns act as a hinge and remain intact.
*   Often associated with **[[Osteoporosis]]** in the elderly, where trivial trauma (like a jerk) can cause a fracture.

#### 2. Clinical Features
*   Pain in the back (thoracolumbar region is common: D12, L1).
*   Local tenderness and kyphotic deformity (Knuckle or Gibbus) may be present.
*   Neurological examination is usually normal.

#### 3. Radiological Findings
*   **X-ray:** Shows diminished anterior height of the vertebra (wedging). The posterior height remains normal.
*   **CT/MRI:** Confirms that the posterior wall of the vertebral body is intact and there is no canal encroachment.

#### 4. Management
*   **Conservative:** Since it is a stable injury, bed rest for a few days followed by mobilization with a **[[Hyperextension Brace]]** (e.g., [[Taylor's Brace]] or [[ASH Brace]]) is usually sufficient,.
*   **Vertebroplasty/Kyphoplasty:** May be considered for painful osteoporotic fractures.

### Detailed Analysis: Burst Fracture

#### 1. Mechanism and Pathology
*   Occurs due to severe **axial compression** (vertical load), such as landing on feet from a height or a heavy object falling on the shoulders,.
*   The nucleus pulposus is driven into the vertebral body, causing it to "explode" or burst outward.
*   Crucially, the **middle column** is fractured, and the posterior wall of the vertebral body is shattered,.

#### 2. Clinical Features
*   Severe back pain and inability to stand/walk.
*   **[[Neurological Deficit]]**: High risk of paraplegia or cauda equina syndrome due to retropulsion of bone fragments into the spinal canal.
*   Palpable widening of spinous processes may indicate posterior element disruption.

#### 3. Radiological Findings
*   **X-ray (AP View):** **Widening of the interpedicular distance** is a hallmark sign, indicating the vertebral body has splayed out.
*   **X-ray (Lateral View):** Loss of both anterior and posterior vertebral body height.
*   **CT Scan:** The investigation of choice to visualize the **retropulsion** of bone fragments into the [[Spinal Canal]] and assess the degree of canal compromise,.
*   **MRI:** Essential to assess damage to the [[Spinal Cord]] and soft tissues.

#### 4. Management
*   **Conservative:** Only for neurologically intact patients with minimal canal compromise. Treated with extended bed rest and a body cast/brace.
*   **Surgical:** Indicated for unstable fractures, progressive neurological deficit, or significant canal compromise.
    *   **[[Decompression]]**: Removal of bone fragments pressing on the cord.
    *   **[[Stabilization]]**: Using pedicle screws and rods (Posterior instrumentation) or anterior plating,.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Diagnostic Trap:** A burst fracture can look like a compression fracture on a lateral X-ray if the posterior wall involvement is subtle. Always check the **interpedicular distance** on the AP view; if it is widened, it is a burst fracture,.
*   **Neurological Watch:** Any patient with a burst fracture requires rigorous and repeated neurological monitoring (motor, sensory, bladder/bowel function).
*   **Osteoporosis:** In elderly patients, compression fractures can occur with little to no pain. Always screen for underlying metabolic bone disease.

### Mnemonics

*   **"C" for Compression:**
    *   **C**urve (Flexion injury)
    *   **C**rushed anteriorly
    *   **C**olumn (Anterior only)
    *   **C**onservative care usually

*   **"B" for Burst:**
    *   **B**lasted (Axial load)
    *   **B**oth columns (Anterior + Middle)
    *   **B**ack wall broken (Retropulsion)
    *   **B**ad for the cord (Neuro deficit risk)
