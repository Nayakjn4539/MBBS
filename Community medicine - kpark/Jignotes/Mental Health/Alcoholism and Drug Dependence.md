# Alcoholism and Drug Dependence

### Definitions and Concepts

*   **Drug:** Any substance that, when taken into the living organism, may modify one or more of its functions.
*   **Drug Abuse:** Self-administration of a drug for non-medical reasons, in quantities and frequencies which may impair an individual's ability to function effectively, and which results in social, physical, or emotional harm.
*   **[[Drug Dependence]]:** A state, psychic and sometimes also physical, resulting from the interaction between a living organism and a drug. It is characterized by behavioral responses that always include a compulsion to take the drug on a continuous or periodic basis to experience its psychic effects, and sometimes to avoid the discomfort of its absence.
*   **[[Drug Addiction]]:** A state of periodic or chronic intoxication produced by the repeated consumption of a drug. It involves:
    1.  An overpowering desire or need (compulsion) to continue taking the drug and to obtain it by any means.
    2.  A tendency to increase the dose (**Tolerance**).
    3.  A psychic (psychological) and generally a physical dependence on the effects of the drug.
    4.  Detrimental effect on the individual and society.
*   **Withdrawal Syndrome:** A cluster of physiological and behavioral symptoms (e.g., nausea, tremors, anxiety) that occur upon the abrupt cessation or reduction of a drug upon which the body has become physically dependent.

### Epidemiological Determinants

#### 1. Agent Factors (The Substances)
According to ICD-10, the following are recognized as psychoactive substances capable of producing dependence:

*   **[[Alcohol]]:**
    *   Pharmacologically a **sedative/depressant** (not a stimulant).
    *   Produces psychic dependence (mild to strong) and physical dependence (develops slowly).
    *   Acts as a "disease agent" causing cirrhosis, gastritis, cardiomyopathy, and peripheral neuropathy.
*   **Opioids:** Includes [[Heroin]] (diacetylmorphine - worst type of addiction), Morphine, Codeine, Methadone. Causes strong psychic and physical dependence rapidly.
*   **Cannabinoids:** Derived from *Cannabis sativa*. Forms include **Bhang** (dried leaves), **Ganja** (flowering tops), and **Charas/Hashish** (resin).
*   **Sedatives/Hypnotics:** Barbiturates (sleeping pills). Addiction produces severe withdrawal.
*   **Stimulants:**
    *   **Amphetamines:** Known as "Superman drugs" because they boost energy and self-confidence.
    *   **Cocaine:** Derived from coca leaves; causes intense excitement and hallucinations.
*   **Hallucinogens:** [[LSD]] (Lysergic acid diethylamide). Produces psychic changes but no physical dependence.
*   **Volatile Solvents:** Glue, petrol, paint thinners (sniffing).
*   **Tobacco:** Causes more deaths than all other psychoactive substances combined.

#### 2. Host Factors
*   **Age:** Adolescents and young adults are most vulnerable due to curiosity, desire to experiment, and peer pressure.
*   **Psychological Profile:** Individuals with social/psychological maladjustment, anxiety, or those seeking escape from frustration/stress.
*   **Motives:** Pleasure-seeking, sense of adventure, wish for self-knowledge, or relief from pain.

#### 3. Environmental Factors
*   **Social Environment:** Broken homes, lack of parental control, alienation from family, unemployment.
*   **Availability:** Easy access to drugs (legal or illegal) and trafficking.
*   **Peer Pressure:** Need for acceptance within a group; "Drug culture."
*   **Urbanization:** Migration to cities, large urban environments, and areas with high crime rates.

### Clinical Picture and Identification

#### Symptoms of Drug Addiction
*   **Physical:** Unsteady gait, tremors, slurried speech, reddening of eyes (cannabis), puffiness under eyes, fresh injection marks/tracks, loss of appetite, and weight loss.
*   **Behavioral:** Loss of interest in sports/daily routine, sudden change in mood/temper tantrums, lethargy, drowsiness, or sleeplessness.
*   **Social:** Disappearance of articles from home (to sell for drugs), preference for solitude (especially long hours in the toilet).

#### Alcoholism Specifics
*   **Acute Intoxication:** Euphoria, impaired judgment, ataxia, slurred speech.
*   **Chronic Alcoholism:** [[Cirrhosis of liver]], toxic psychosis, gastritis, pancreatitis, memory loss, and social disorganization (crime, domestic violence).

### Prevention and Control

Approaches must be realistic, focusing on demand reduction, supply reduction, and harm reduction.

#### 1. Primary Prevention (Prevention of Onset)
*   **Legal Measures:**
    *   Strict enforcement of the **[[Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985]]** (NDPS Act).
    *   Regulation of alcohol manufacture, distribution, and age limits for purchase.
    *   **[[COPTA]]** regarding tobacco control.
*   **Educational Approach:**
    *   **Health Education:** Targeted at schools, colleges, and the general public via mass media to deglamorize drug use.
    *   Clarify misconceptions (e.g., that drugs solve problems).
*   **Community Approach:**
    *   Identification of "at-risk" groups and providing alternatives (teen centers, sports, artistic activities).
    *   Improving the social environment (poverty alleviation, employment).

#### 2. Secondary Prevention (Early Diagnosis and Treatment)
*   **Identification:** Early detection of addicts and motivating them for detoxification.
*   **Detoxification:** Often requires hospitalization to manage withdrawal symptoms safely.
*   **Treatment Settings:**
    *   **[[Drug De-addiction Centres]] (DDCs):** Provide medical treatment, counseling, and yoga therapy.
    *   **Brief Intervention:** For hazardous alcohol users in primary care.

#### 3. Tertiary Prevention (Rehabilitation)
*   **Psychotherapy:** To address underlying psychological causes.
*   **Social Rehabilitation:** Restoring the individual to family and society; vocational training.
*   **Support Groups:**
    *   **[[Alcoholics Anonymous]] (AA)** and **Narcotics Anonymous (NA):** Peer support groups crucial for maintaining sobriety and preventing relapse.
*   **Harm Reduction:**
    *   Needle exchange programs (to prevent HIV/Hepatitis).
    *   Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST) using Methadone or Buprenorphine.

### Clinical Relevance & Management

*   **CAGE Questionnaire:** A simple screening tool for Alcoholism.
    *   **C**ut down (Have you felt the need to cut down?)
    *   **A**nnoyed (Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking?)
    *   **G**uilty (Have you felt guilty about drinking?)
    *   **E**ye-opener (Do you need a drink first thing in the morning?)
*   **Dual Diagnosis:** Co-occurrence of mental illness (like depression or schizophrenia) and substance abuse requires integrated treatment under the **[[National Mental Health Programme]]**.

### Mnemonics for Drug Abuse Causes

**"PEER" Pressure**
*   **P** - **P**eer pressure / **P**ersonality disorders
*   **E** - **E**scape from reality (Stress/Frustration)
*   **E** - **E**asy availability
*   **R** - **R**ejection (Broken homes/Family conflict)
