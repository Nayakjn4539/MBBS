# Assessment of Visual Acuity

**[[Visual Acuity]]** is a measure of the spatial resolution of the visual processing system. It essentially assesses the ability of the eye to discriminate between two points.

### Components of Visual Acuity
The faculty of vision is complex and consists of three distinct components:
1.  **Minimum Visible:** The ability to determine whether an object is present or not.
2.  **Minimum Resolvable (Ordinary Visual Acuity):** The ability to discriminate two spatially separated targets. This is determined by the **[[Minimum Angle of Resolution]] (MAR)**.
3.  **Minimum Discriminable (Hyperacuity):** The ability to detect differences in the spatial location of two or more objects (e.g., Vernier acuity). This threshold is much lower than ordinary acuity (often measured in seconds of arc).

### Distant Visual Acuity

#### 1. Snellen's Chart
This is the most standard method for clinical testing.
*   **Principle:** The optotypes (letters) are designed such that the whole letter subtends an angle of **5 minutes of arc** and each component limb of the letter subtends **1 minute of arc** at the [[Nodal Point]] of the eye at the respective testing distance.
*   **Testing Distance:** **6 meters** (or 20 feet).
    *   **Reason:** At 6 meters, rays of light are considered practically parallel, so the patient exerts minimal [[Accommodation]].
*   **Chart Design:** Consists of rows of letters of diminishing size. The top letter corresponds to 6/60 (subtends 5 minutes at 60 meters), down to 6/6 or even 6/5.

**Recording Vision (Snellen Fraction):**
$$Visual Acuity (V) = \frac{d}{D}$$
*   **d** = Distance at which the patient is sitting (usually 6m).
*   **D** = Distance at which a normal eye should be able to read that line.
    *   **6/6:** Normal vision.
    *   **6/60:** Patient reads at 6m what a normal person reads at 60m.

**Procedure for Subnormal Vision:**
If the patient cannot read the top line (6/60) at 6 meters, the following sequence is used:
1.  **Walk-up:** Move the patient closer (e.g., 5/60, 4/60... 1/60).
2.  **Finger Counting (FC):** If 1/60 is not read, ask the patient to count fingers against a dark background. Recorded as FC at x meters (e.g., **FC at 1m** or **CF close to face**).
3.  **Hand Movements (HM):** If fingers are not counted, move hand in front of the eye. Recorded as **HM+**.
4.  **Perception of Light (PL):** If hand movements are not seen, shine a light into the eye.
    *   **PL+:** Patient perceives light.
    *   **PL-:** Total blindness.
5.  **Projection of Rays (PR):** If PL+, check perception in all four quadrants (Superior, Inferior, Nasal, Temporal). Accurate PR indicates a functioning [[Retina]] and [[Optic Nerve]].

**Clinical Implication:**
If visual acuity improves with a **[[Pinhole]]**, the cause is likely a **[[Refractive Error]]**. If vision remains the same or worsens (due to reduced illumination), the cause is likely organic (e.g., [[Corneal Opacity]], [[Cataract]], or [[Macular Disorders]]).

#### 2. Other Distance Charts
*   **Landolt C-Ring / Snellen’s E-Chart:** Used for illiterate patients. The patient indicates the direction of the gap in the 'C' or the limbs of the 'E'.
*   **LogMAR Charts (e.g., Bailey-Lovie, ETDRS):**
    *   Used for research and precise assessment.
    *   **Geometric progression:** Letter sizes change in uniform steps (0.1 Log unit).
    *   Avoids the "crowding phenomenon" issues seen with Snellen charts.
    *   **5 letters** per line.

| Notation System | Normal Vision | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Snellen (Metric)** | 6/6 | Standard clinical use |
| **Snellen (Imperial)**| 20/20 | Used in USA |
| **Decimal** | 1.0 | 6/6 = 1.0; 6/60 = 0.1 |
| **LogMAR** | 0.0 | 0.0 is normal; 1.0 is 6/60 |

### Near Visual Acuity

*   **Distance:** Tested at **30-35 cm** (standard reading distance) or 40cm.
*   **Lighting:** Good illumination is essential.
*   **Charts Used:**
    *   **Snellen’s Near Chart:** Reduced Snellen letters.
    *   **Jaeger’s Chart:** Extracts from print of different sizes (J1 is fine print, J7 is large).
    *   **Roman Test Types / N-Notation:** Based on printer's point system (e.g., N5, N6, N8, where N5 is normal).
*   **Clinical Implication:** Primarily used to diagnose **[[Presbyopia]]** or hypermetropia.

### Assessment in Infants and Pre-verbal Children

Since infants cannot read charts, objective or behavioral tests are used.

#### 1. Qualitative Assessment
*   **Fixation Reflex:** Should be Central, Steady, and Maintained (**CSM**).
*   **Menace Reflex:** Blinking when an object is brought threateningly close (develops by 4-6 months).
*   **Blink Reflex:** Blinking in response to bright light (present at birth).

#### 2. Quantitative/Semi-Quantitative Tests
*   **Preferential Looking Test (PLT):** Based on the principle that infants prefer looking at patterned stimuli over a plain field.
    *   **[[Teller Acuity Cards]]:** Cards with gratings (stripes) of various widths.
*   **Optokinetic Nystagmus (OKN):** Using a rotating **[[OKN Drum]]** or Catford drum. If the child sees the stripes, nystagmus is induced.
*   **Cardiff Acuity Test:** Uses "vanishing optotypes" (pictures that disappear when beyond the resolution limit).
*   **Visual Evoked Potential ([[VEP]]):** Electrophysiological test measuring the integrity of the visual pathway from retina to cortex. Useful in uncooperative patients or to detect malingering.

### Assessment of Contrast Sensitivity

Visual acuity tests "quantity" of vision (high contrast), while contrast sensitivity tests "quality".
*   **Indication:** Useful in detecting early changes in **[[Cataract]]**, **[[Glaucoma]]**, **[[Optic Neuritis]]**, and **[[Diabetic Retinopathy]]** where Snellen acuity might still be 6/6.
*   **Charts:**
    *   **Pelli-Robson Chart:** Letters of constant size but decreasing contrast.
    *   **Arden Gratings:** Plates with sinusoidal gratings.
    *   **Cambridge Low Contrast Gratings.**

### Special Tests for Macular Function

Used when media opacity (e.g., Cataract) prevents direct visualization of the fundus or standard acuity testing.

1.  **Potential Acuity Meter (PAM):** Projects a Snellen chart through clear areas of the lens directly onto the retina.
2.  **Laser Interferometry:** Projects interference fringes onto the retina; bypasses optical aberrations.
3.  **Photostress Test:**
    *   Differentiates **[[Macular Disease]]** from **[[Optic Nerve Disease]]**.
    *   The eye is exposed to bright light for 10-15 seconds.
    *   **Recovery time:** Time taken to return to pre-test acuity.
    *   **Result:** Prolonged recovery (>50 seconds) suggests macular pathology (e.g., **[[Cystoid Macular Edema]]**); normal recovery suggests optic nerve pathology.
4.  **Amsler Grid:** Used to detect **[[Metamorphopsia]]** (distortion) and central scotomas in macular diseases like **[[ARMD]]**.

### Classification of Visual Impairment

**WHO / NPCB Definitions (India):**

*   **[[Blindness]]:**
    *   Visual acuity **< 3/60** in the better eye with available correction.
    *   **OR** Visual field **< 10 degrees** from the center of fixation.
*   **Severe Visual Impairment:** Visual acuity between **< 6/60 and 3/60**.
*   **Moderate Visual Impairment:** Visual acuity between **< 6/18 and 6/60**.
*   **Low Vision:** Visual acuity < 6/18 but $\ge$ 3/60, or field < 20 degrees.

**Mnemonic for Snellen Distance:**
**"S**ix **M**eters **S**aves **A**ccommodation" (Testing at 6 meters minimizes accommodation).
