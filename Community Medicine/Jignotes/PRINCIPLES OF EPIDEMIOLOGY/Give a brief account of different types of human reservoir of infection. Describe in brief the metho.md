# [[PRINCIPLES OF EPIDEMIOLOGY]] > Give a brief account of different types of human reservoir of infection. Describe in brief the methods of controlling reservoir.

# Human Reservoir of Infection

The **human reservoir** is the most important source of infection for human beings. Man is often described as his own enemy because most communicable diseases are contracted from human sources. The human reservoir can be broadly classified into two main types: **Cases** and **Carriers**.,

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a flowchart showing Human Reservoir divided into Cases and Carriers. Further divide Cases into Clinical, Subclinical, Latent and Carriers into Incubatory, Convalescent, Healthy, Temporary, Chronic.

### 1. Cases
A case is defined as a person in the population identified as having the particular disease, health disorder, or condition under investigation.,

*   **Clinical Cases:** These present with overt signs and symptoms. They may be mild, moderate, severe, or fatal.
    *   *Epidemiological Importance:* **Mild cases** are often more important sources of infection than severe cases because they remain [[ambulant]] (walking around) and spread infection widely, whereas severe cases are usually confined to bed/isolation.,
*   **Subclinical Cases:** Also known as inapparent, covert, or missed cases. The agent multiplies in the host, but there are no clinical signs.
    *   *Importance:* They play a dominant role in maintaining the **chain of infection** ([[endemicity]]) in the community. This is famously represented by the "submerged portion" of the [[Iceberg Phenomenon]].,
*   **Latent Infection:** The host does not shed the infectious agent. The agent lies dormant within the host without symptoms (e.g., Herpes simplex, Shingles). This is distinct from subclinical infection where shedding occurs.,

### 2. Carriers
A [[carrier]] is an infected person or animal that harbors a specific infectious agent in the absence of discernible clinical disease and serves as a potential source of infection for others.,

**Key Elements of a Carrier State:**
1.  Presence of disease agent in the body.
2.  Absence of recognizable symptoms/signs.
3.  **Shedding** of the disease agent in discharges/excretions.

#### Classification of Carriers

| Classification Basis | Type | Description & Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A. By Type** | **1. Incubatory** | Sheds agent during incubation period (before onset). <br> *Ex:* Measles, Mumps, Polio, Pertussis, Hepatitis B. |
| | **2. Convalescent** | Sheds agent during recovery period. Clinical recovery $\neq$ Bacteriological recovery. <br> *Ex:* Typhoid, Cholera, Diphtheria, Dysentery. |
| | **3. Healthy** | Victims of subclinical infection who shed agent without ever suffering overt disease. <br> *Ex:* Polio, Cholera, Meningococcal meningitis. |
| **B. By Duration** | **1. Temporary** | Sheds agent for a short period (includes incubatory, convalescent, and healthy). |
| | **2. Chronic** | Excretes agent for indefinite periods (years). <br> *Ex:* [[Typhoid fever]], Hepatitis B, Malaria, Gonorrhea. |
| **C. By Portal of Exit** | **1. Urinary** | *Ex:* Typhoid (Urinary carriers are more dangerous than intestinal). |
| | **2. Intestinal** | *Ex:* Typhoid, Cholera, Amoebiasis. |
| | **3. Respiratory** | *Ex:* Influenza, Meningococcal meningitis. |

> **Mnemonic for Incubatory Carriers:** **M**y **C**ute **P**et **I**s **H**ealthy
> *   **M**easles / **M**umps
> *   **C**hickenpox (late IP)
> *   **P**ertussis / **P**olio
> *   **I**nfluenza
> *   **H**epatitis B

# Methods of Controlling the Reservoir

The objective is to break the weakest link in the chain of transmission. Control measures applied to the reservoir aim to reduce the quantity of the infectious agent available for dissemination.

### 1. Early Diagnosis (Detection)
*   The first line of defense. Rapid identification involves clinical diagnosis and laboratory confirmation.
*   **Active Case Finding:** Health workers go to the community to find cases (e.g., Malaria, TB).
*   **Passive Case Finding:** Patients visit health facilities.,

### 2. Notification
*   Once detected, diseases must be reported to the [[Local Health Authority]].
*   This allows for immediate intervention and statistical analysis.
*   Certain diseases are notifiable internationally (e.g., Cholera, Plague, Yellow Fever) to WHO.,

### 3. Isolation
*   **Definition:** Separation of infected persons for the **period of communicability** in places/conditions that prevent transmission to susceptibles.
*   **Types:** Standard, Strict, Protective, and High Security isolation.
*   **Limitation:** It is a "barrier approach." It fails in diseases with a large subclinical component (e.g., Polio, Hep A) or where shedding occurs before diagnosis (e.g., Mumps).
*   *Note:* Today, isolation is recommended only when the risk of transmission is exceptionally serious.

### 4. Treatment
*   **Objective:** To kill the infectious agent when it is still in the reservoir (before dissemination).
*   Treatment reduces communicability and prevents secondary cases.
*   **Mass Treatment:** Used in diseases like Yaws, Trachoma, and Filaria to treat latent/subclinical infections along with active cases.,,

### 5. Quarantine
*   **Definition:** Restriction of activities of **healthy/exposed** persons for a period equal to the **longest incubation period** of the disease.,
*   *Contrast:* Isolation is for the *sick*; Quarantine is for the *healthy* (contacts).
*   It has largely been replaced by **Active Surveillance** in modern public health.

### 6. Surveillance
*   Continuous scrutiny of all aspects of occurrence and spread of disease.
*   It includes data collection, analysis, interpretation, and **feedback** for action.
*   Types include Sentinel Surveillance (for missing cases) and Serological Surveillance.,

### 7. Disinfection
*   **Concurrent:** Application of disinfectants immediately after the discharge of infectious material (e.g., disinfecting urine/feces of a typhoid patient instantly).
*   **Terminal:** Disinfection after the patient has died, recovered, or been removed (less common now; terminal *cleaning* is preferred).

### [[Clinical Relevance]]
**Typhoid Mary:** The most famous example of a **Chronic Carrier**. Mary Mallon was a cook who carried *Salmonella Typhi* in her gallbladder and infected over 50 people (causing 3 deaths) because she refused to believe she was the source (as she was asymptomatic) and refused to stop cooking. This highlights the danger of chronic carriers in food handling industries.
