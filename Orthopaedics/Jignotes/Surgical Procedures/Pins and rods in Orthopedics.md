# [[Surgical Procedures]] > Pins and rods in Orthopedics

### **Pins and Rods in Orthopedics**

In orthopedic surgery, metal implants are categorized broadly into surface implants (plates/screws), intramedullary implants (nails/rods), and transfixion implants (pins/wires). These devices are fundamental for [[Osteosynthesis]] (fixation of bone) and [[Skeletal Traction]].

---

### **1. Orthopedic Pins and Wires**

Pins are generally used for temporary fixation, skeletal traction, or as part of external fixator systems.

#### **A. Kirschner Wires ([[K-wires]])**
*   **Description:** Thin, smooth stainless steel or titanium wires.
*   **Diameter:** Ranges from **0.6 mm to 3.2 mm**.
*   **Tips:** Pointed at both ends (trocar tip or diamond tip) to allow drilling from either end.
*   **Properties:** Flexible but possess high tensile strength.
*   **Uses:**
    *   **Internal Fixation:** For small bones (phalanges, metacarpals, metatarsals) and fractures in children (e.g., [[Supracondylar fracture of humerus]]).
    *   **Tension Band Wiring ([[TBW]]):** Used in conjunction with cerclage wire for olecranon and patella fractures to convert distracting forces into compression forces.
    *   **Temporary Fixation:** Holds fragments in place before definitive plating or nailing.
    *   **Skeletal Traction:** In the upper limb or for small bones.
*   **Clinical Implication:** K-wires are often left protruding through the skin for easy removal later. The exposed ends must be bent and covered to prevent migration and injury.

#### **B. Steinmann Pins**
*   **Description:** Rigid, stainless steel rods, thicker than K-wires.
*   **Diameter:** Typically **4 mm to 5 mm**.
*   **Usage:** primarily for **[[Skeletal Traction]]** in the lower limb (upper tibia, lower femur, calcaneum).
*   **Mode of Action:** They pass through the bone and are attached to a [[Bohler's stirrup]] to apply traction weights.

#### **C. Denham Pins**
*   **Description:** Similar to a Steinmann pin but features a **threaded section** in the center.
*   **Purpose:** The threads engage the bony cortex to prevent the pin from sliding sideways (migration).
*   **Indication:** specifically useful in **cancellous bone** (e.g., [[Calcaneum]]) or **osteoporotic bones** where smooth pins might loosen or cut through.

#### **D. Schantz Pins (Screws)**
*   **Description:** Thick, partially threaded pins.
*   **Usage:** Used as the bone-anchoring component in **[[External Fixation]]** systems (e.g., for open fractures or pelvis stabilization).
*   **Technique:** They are screwed into the bone but not through-and-through; the external end connects to the fixator rod/frame via clamps.

### **2. Skeletal Traction**

Skeletal traction involves pulling directly on the bone using pins to overcome muscle spasm and maintain fracture length.

#### **Common Sites and Landmarks**
| Site | Anatomical Landmark for Insertion | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Upper Tibia** | 2 cm distal and posterior to the [[Tibial Tuberosity]] | Fractures of the femoral shaft |
| **Distal Femur** | Just proximal to the adductor tubercle | Fractures of the femoral shaft/pelvis |
| **Calcaneum** | 2-2.5 cm below and behind the lateral malleolus | Tibial fractures |
| **Olecranon** | 3 cm distal to the tip of the olecranon | Comminuted distal humerus fractures |

#### **Procedure for Pin Insertion**
1.  **Asepsis:** Strict aseptic technique in the operating theater.
2.  **Anesthesia:** Local infiltration of periosteum on both entry and exit sides.
3.  **Incision:** Small stab incision.
4.  **Direction:** Always insert from the **side of risk to the side of safety** to avoid neurovascular damage.
    *   **Tibia:** Insert **Lateral to Medial** (to avoid the Common Peroneal Nerve).
    *   **Femur:** Insert **Medial to Lateral** (to avoid the Femoral Artery/Vein in Hunter's canal).
5.  **Drilling:** Use a T-handle or hand drill.
6.  **Stirrup:** Attach [[Bohler's stirrup]] which allows free rotation of the pin without rotating the bone.

**Mnemonic for Tibial Pin Insertion:**
**L**ove **T**o **M**eet (**L**ateral **T**o **M**edial in **T**ibia).

### **3. Intramedullary Rods and Nails**

Intramedullary (IM) nails act as **internal splints**. They are load-sharing devices placed within the medullary canal of long bones.

#### **A. Küntscher Nail ([[K-nail]])**
*   **Structure:** Hollow, stainless steel tube with a **cloverleaf** cross-section.
*   **Properties:** The cloverleaf shape provides elasticity and allows compression of the nail against the canal walls (**3-point fixation**).
*   **Eye:** Has a slot/eye at the ends for extraction.
*   **Indication:** Historically used for fractures at the **isthmus** of the femur.
*   **Limitation:** Does **not** provide rotational stability (can spin inside the canal). Not suitable for comminuted or peri-articular fractures.

#### **B. Interlocking Nails ([[ILN]])**
*   **Structure:** A hollow nail with proximal and distal holes for locking bolts.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **Locking Bolts:** Transfix the bone and nail, preventing **rotation** and **shortening** (telescoping).
    *   **Static Locking:** Bolts placed at both ends (maximum stability).
    *   **Dynamic Locking:** Bolts placed at one end only (allows compression at the fracture site upon weight bearing).
*   **Indication:** Gold standard for **diaphyseal fractures** of the femur and tibia. Can handle comminuted and segmental fractures.
*   **Insertion:** Requires reaming of the canal (to increase contact area) and a C-arm (image intensifier) for locking screw placement.

#### **C. Rush Nails**
*   **Structure:** Solid, round, flexible rods with a **sled-runner tip** (beveled) and a hooked head.
*   **Mechanism:** Rely on **3-point dynamic fixation**. The pre-bent rod exerts spring-like pressure against the inner cortices.
*   **Indication:** Fibula fractures, forearm fractures, or supracondylar fractures in special cases.

#### **D. Titanium Elastic Nail System ([[TENS]]) / Ender Nails**
*   **Structure:** Flexible, elastic nails made of titanium.
*   **Mechanism:** Inserted in pairs (C-shaped configuration) to provide "elastic stability."
*   **Indication:** **Pediatric fractures** (especially femoral shaft fractures in children aged 5–12 years) where the growth plate must be preserved.

### **4. Comparison of Implant Types**

| Feature | **K-Nail** | **Interlocking Nail (ILN)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stability** | 3-point fixation (Elastic jam fit) | Bolts + Nail (Mechanical lock) |
| **Rotation Control** | Poor (can rotate) | Excellent (bolts prevent rotation) |
| **Length Control** | Poor (can collapse/shorten) | Excellent (bolts prevent telescoping) |
| **Fracture Type** | Simple transverse/short oblique at isthmus | Comminuted, spiral, segmental, proximal/distal |
| **Reaming** | Usually required | Can be reamed or unreamed |
| **Current Status** | Rarely used (Historical/Resource-poor settings) | **Standard of Care** for long bones |

### **5. Complications of Pins and Rods**

**Pin Tract Infection**
*   **Cause:** Bacteria enter along the pin-skin interface.
*   **Prevention:** Daily dressing, release skin tension around the pin during insertion.
*   **Sequelae:** Can lead to [[Ring Sequestrum]] or chronic osteomyelitis.

**Fat Embolism Syndrome ([[FES]])**
*   **Cause:** Reaming of the medullary canal pressurizes marrow fat, forcing it into the venous circulation.
*   **Prevention:** Venting the femur, careful reaming technique.

**Implant Failure**
*   **Nail Breakage:** Due to non-union or metal fatigue.
*   **Migration:** Smooth K-wires can migrate internally or externally if not bent/secured.
*   **Jamming:** Using a nail diameter too large for the canal or mismatch between the curvature of the nail and the bone (e.g., in the femur).

**Clinical Implication - MRI Compatibility:**
Titanium nails/pins are MRI compatible (non-ferromagnetic), whereas stainless steel implants create significant artifacts and may heat up/move during MRI.
