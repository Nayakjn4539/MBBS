# Bone Biopsy Techniques

[[Bone biopsy]] is a definitive diagnostic procedure involving the removal of a sample of bone tissue for histological, microbiological, or cytogenetic analysis. It is the gold standard for diagnosing [[bone tumors]] and distinguishing them from infections or other mimics.

### Indications
*   **Tumors:** To determine the nature (benign vs. malignant), histological type, and grade of a [[bone tumor]].
*   **Infection:** To confirm [[osteomyelitis]] and identify the causative organism and antibiotic sensitivity.
*   **Metabolic Bone Disease:** To evaluate conditions like [[osteomalacia]] or [[renal osteodystrophy]] (often transiliac biopsy).
*   **Uncertain Diagnosis:** Distinguishing between compression fractures, metastasis, or primary bone lesions.

> **Clinical Implication:** Radical surgery (like [[amputation]] or limb salvage) should **never** be undertaken for a suspected neoplasm without first confirming the diagnosis histologically via biopsy.

### Principles of Biopsy Planning
Proper planning is critical to ensure the biopsy does not compromise future limb-salvage surgery.

1.  **Imaging First:** All imaging studies ([[MRI]], [[CT scan]], [[Bone scan]]) should be completed **before** the biopsy to avoid artifacts caused by the procedure,.
2.  **Surgical Approach:**
    *   The biopsy tract must be placed so that it can be **excised** en bloc with the tumor during the definitive surgery.
    *   **Longitudinal incisions** are preferred; avoid transverse incisions.
    *   Avoid exposing major [[neurovascular structures]] to prevent tumor contamination,.
3.  **Compartment Containment:** The needle or incision should traverse only **one** anatomical compartment to prevent seeding tumor cells into adjacent healthy compartments,.
4.  **Site Selection:** The periphery of the tumor (boundary zone) usually yields viable tissue, whereas the center may be necrotic,.

### Types of Bone Biopsy Techniques

#### 1. Closed Biopsy (Needle Biopsy)
This is the procedure of choice for most lesions because it is less invasive and carries a lower risk of contamination.

**A. Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology ([[FNAC]])**
*   **Instrument:** 22-gauge needle.
*   **Utility:** Yields only cells (cytology), not structural tissue. Useful for soft, homogenous lesions or confirming metastasis.
*   **Limitation:** Often insufficient for primary bone tumor diagnosis due to lack of tissue architecture.

**B. Core Needle Biopsy (Trephine Biopsy)**
*   **Instrument:** Large-bore needle (e.g., [[Jamshidi needle]], 14-gauge) or cutting trephine,.
*   **Utility:** Obtains a cylinder (core) of tissue, preserving architecture for histological structural analysis.
*   **Procedure:**
    *   Performed under local or general anesthesia.
    *   **Image Guidance:** [[Fluoroscopy]] (C-arm) or CT scan is essential for deep-seated or spinal lesions to ensure accuracy.
    *   **Accuracy:** High accuracy rate (>95%) in experienced hands.

#### 2. Open Biopsy
Surgical exposure of the bone to obtain tissue. It is the most reliable method but carries higher risks of infection, hemorrhage, and tumor spill.

**A. Incisional Biopsy**
*   **Definition:** Removal of a small selected portion of the tumor.
*   **Indication:** Large tumors where definitive resection is planned later; used to determine grade and type.
*   **Technique:**
    *   A window is created in the cortex (round or oval to reduce stress risers and risk of [[pathological fracture]]).
    *   A wedge of tissue including the **pseudocapsule** and tumor is removed.

**B. Excisional Biopsy**
*   **Definition:** Removal of the entire lesion.
*   **Indication:** Small lesions that are almost certainly benign (e.g., [[osteoid osteoma]], small [[exostosis]]).
*   **Contraindication:** Should **not** be performed for suspected malignant tumors as it may result in incomplete margins (intralesional excision).

### Comparison: Open vs. Closed Biopsy

| Feature | Closed (Needle) Biopsy | Open Biopsy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Invasiveness** | Minimally invasive | Invasive surgery |
| **Tissue Sample** | Small core or cells | Large sample (architecture preserved) |
| **Diagnostic Accuracy** | >95% (if correctly targeted) | Nearly 100% |
| **Contamination Risk** | Low (small track) | Higher (hematoma spread) |
| **Cost/Recovery** | Lower cost, rapid recovery | Higher cost, longer recovery |
| **Indication** | Deep lesions, vertebrae, metastasis | When needle biopsy is inconclusive |

### Technical Steps and Precautions

1.  **Anesthesia & Setup:** Performed in an operating theater with full aseptic technique.
2.  **Hemostasis:**
    *   A [[pneumatic tourniquet]] may be used but **must be released** before wound closure to ensure meticulous hemostasis. This prevents [[hematoma]] formation, which can track tumor cells into soft tissues,.
    *   **Bone Wax** or [[polymethylmethacrylate]] (bone cement) can be used to seal the cortical window after open biopsy to prevent bleeding and tumor cell leakage.
3.  **Drains:** Avoid using drains if possible. If necessary, the drain site must be placed in line with the incision so the tract can be excised later.
4.  **Frozen Section:** Used intra-operatively to confirm that representative diagnostic tissue has been obtained, but not necessarily for a definitive diagnosis.

### Specimen Processing
Instructions to the pathologist are crucial:
*   **Tumor:** Fresh tissue or formalin-fixed (prevents autolysis).
*   **Infection:** Saline or dry tube for **culture and sensitivity** (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal, TB).
*   **Crystals (Gout):** Fresh or in saline (Formalin dissolves urate crystals).

---

### Complications
*   **Hemorrhage:** Especially in vascular tumors like [[telangiectatic osteosarcoma]] or metastases from renal cell carcinoma.
*   **Pathological Fracture:** Due to cortical defect created by the biopsy (round holes preferred over square),.
*   **Infection:** Post-procedure osteomyelitis.
*   **Non-diagnostic sample:** Necrotic tissue or sampling error.
*   **Tumor Seeding:** Contamination of needle track or soft tissues.

**Mnemonic for Biopsy Rules: "PLAINS"**
*   **P**lanned incision (longitudinal).
*   **L**imb salvage consideration (don't contaminate flaps).
*   **A**dequate hemostasis (prevent hematoma).
*   **I**maging before biopsy.
*   **N**o transverse incisions.
*   **S**ample the periphery (viable tissue).
