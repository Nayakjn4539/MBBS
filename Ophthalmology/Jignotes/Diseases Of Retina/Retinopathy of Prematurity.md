# [[Retinopathy of Prematurity]] (ROP)

[[Retinopathy of Prematurity]] is a bilateral proliferative retinopathy occurring in premature infants with low birth weight who often have been exposed to high concentrations of oxygen. It was formerly known as [[Retrolental Fibroplasia]].

### Etiopathogenesis
The normal vascularization of the [[Retina]] reaches the nasal periphery by 8 months of gestation and the temporal periphery by 1 month after delivery. In ROP, this vascularization is halted due to hyperoxia (oxygen therapy), leading to:
*   Vaso-obliteration (Phase 1).
*   Followed by hypoxia-induced upregulation of [[Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor]] (VEGF) and [[Insulin-like Growth Factor-1]] (IGF-1).
*   Resulting in neovascularization and fibrous proliferation.

### Classification of ROP (ICROP)
The **International Classification of Retinopathy of Prematurity (ICROP)** describes the disease based on four parameters:
1.  **Location** (Zones)
2.  **Severity** (Stages)
3.  **Extent** (Clock hours)
4.  **Plus Disease** (Vascular activity).

#### 1. Zones of ROP (Location)
The retina is divided into three zones centered on the [[Optic Disc]] (not the fovea).

| Zone | Definition | Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Zone I** | A circle centered on the [[Optic Disc]] with a radius twice the distance from the disc to the [[Fovea]]. | Most posterior. Disease here is usually very severe (Rush disease). |
| **Zone II** | A doughnut-shaped area extending from the edge of Zone I to the nasal [[Ora Serrata]]. | The temporal boundary is the equator. |
| **Zone III** | The remaining temporal crescent of the retina anterior to Zone II. | Least severe zone. |

#### 2. Stages of ROP (Severity)
The evolution of ROP is divided into five stages.

| Stage | Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stage 1** | **Demarcation Line** | A thin, discrete, whitish/grey line separates the vascular (posterior) and avascular (anterior) retina. It lies within the plane of the retina. |
| **Stage 2** | **Ridge** | The line acquires volume, height, and width to form an elevated ridge (pink/white). It extends out of the plane of the retina. |
| **Stage 3** | **Extraretinal Fibrovascular Proliferation** | Fibrovascular tissue (neovascularization) proliferates from the ridge into the [[Vitreous]]. Can be mild, moderate, or severe. |
| **Stage 4** | **Subtotal Retinal Detachment** | **4A:** Partial [[Retinal Detachment]] **sparing** the [[Macula]] (Extra-foveal).<br>**4B:** Partial [[Retinal Detachment]] **involving** the [[Macula]] (Foveal). |
| **Stage 5** | **Total Retinal Detachment** | Total detachment, usually funnel-shaped. |

> **Mnemonic for Stages:**
> **L**ine (Stage 1)
> **R**idge (Stage 2)
> **P**roliferation (Stage 3)
> **D**etachment (Stage 4 & 5)

#### 3. Plus Disease
"Plus" refers to signs of active, progressive vascular incompetence. It is indicated by a **"+"** sign (e.g., Stage 3+).
*   **Definition:** Venous dilatation and arteriolar tortuosity of posterior pole vessels in at least two quadrants.
*   **Other signs:** Iris vascular engorgement (poor pupillary dilation), vitreous haze.
*   **Pre-plus disease:** Vascular changes are more than normal but insufficient for "Plus" diagnosis.

#### 4. Aggressive Posterior ROP (AP-ROP)
*   Formerly known as **"Rush Disease"**.
*   Located in **Zone I** or posterior **Zone II**.
*   Features: Severe plus disease, flat neovascularization (ill-defined), and rapid progression to Stage 5 without passing through typical stages.

### Screening Guidelines
Timely screening is crucial to prevent blindness.

**Criteria for Screening (India/General)**:
*   **Birth Weight:** $\le$ 1750 grams (or $\le$ 1500g in some protocols).
*   **Gestational Age:** $\le$ 34 weeks (or $\le$ 32 weeks).
*   **Risk Factors:** Infants between 34-36 weeks or 1750-2000g *if* they had a stormy course (Oxygen therapy, sepsis, blood transfusions, RDS).

**Timing of First Examination:**
*   **Born < 28 weeks or < 1200g:** Screen at 2-3 weeks of age.
*   **Born > 28 weeks or > 1200g:** Screen at 4 weeks of age (or 31-33 weeks Post-Conceptional Age).

### Treatment Indications and Methods

**1. Threshold Disease**
Historically the indication for treatment. Defined as:
*   **Stage 3** ROP in Zone I or II.
*   **Extent:** 5 contiguous or 8 non-contiguous clock hours.
*   **Presence of "Plus" disease.**

**2. Early Treatment of ROP (ETROP) Guidelines**
Current standard divides disease into Type 1 (Treat) and Type 2 (Observe).

*   **Type 1 ROP (High Risk - TREAT):**
    *   Zone I: Any stage with Plus disease.
    *   Zone I: Stage 3 without Plus disease.
    *   Zone II: Stage 2 or 3 with Plus disease.
*   **Type 2 ROP (Low Risk - OBSERVE):**
    *   Zone I: Stage 1 or 2 without Plus disease.
    *   Zone II: Stage 3 without Plus disease.

**Treatment Modalities:**
*   **[[Laser Photocoagulation]]:** (Gold Standard) Ablation of the avascular immature retina using Diode (810 nm) or Argon/Frequency doubled Nd:YAG (532 nm) laser.
*   **Intravitreal Anti-VEGF agents:** ([[Bevacizumab]] or [[Ranibizumab]]) for Zone I disease or AP-ROP.
*   **[[Cryotherapy]]:** Used if laser is unavailable or media is hazy (older method).
*   **Surgery:** For Stage 4 and 5 (Scleral buckling or [[Pars Plana Vitrectomy]]).
