# [[Ear]] > Tumors of External Ear

### Tumors of the External Ear

The tumors of the external ear are broadly classified based on their location ([[Auricle]]/Pinna vs. [[External Auditory Canal]]) and their biological behavior (Benign vs. Malignant). Of all ear carcinomas, approximately **85% occur on the pinna**, **10% in the external canal**, and **5% in the middle ear**.

### I. Tumors of the Auricle (Pinna)

#### A. Benign Lesions

**1. Preauricular Sinus / Cyst**
*   **Etiology:** Congenital malformation due to faulty union/imperfect fusion of the **6 mesenchymal tubercles ([[Hillocks of His]])** of the 1st and 2nd branchial arches.
*   **Site:** Usually seen as a small pit/depression at the **root of the helix** or in front of the crus of the helix.
*   **Pathology:** Lined by **keratinizing squamous epithelium**. It has a branching tract that may end blindly or attach to the perichondrium.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Usually asymptomatic.
    *   If the opening is blocked, it forms a retention cyst.
    *   Recurrent infection leads to pain, swelling, and purulent discharge (abscess formation).
*   **Treatment:** Surgical excision of the sinus tract if recurrently infected or unsightly. Incomplete removal leads to recurrence.

**2. Keloid**
*   **Etiology:** Often follows trauma, commonly **ear piercing** or surgical incisions.
*   **Pathology:** Abnormal proliferation of fibroblasts and collagen synthesis (3x greater than hypertrophic scars). Genetic susceptibility exists; more common in dark-skinned races.
*   **Clinical Features:** Firm, rubbery, pedunculated nodule, commonly on the lobule or helix. It extends beyond the margins of the original wound.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Surgical excision** usually results in recurrence.
    *   Best treated by excision followed by **local steroid injection** (triamcinolone) or postoperative **radiation**.

**3. Hemangioma**
*   **Features:** Congenital tumor of blood vessels. Capillary hemangiomas appear as a "port-wine stain".
*   **Course:** Many grow rapidly in the neonatal period and then involute spontaneously.
*   **Treatment:** Wait and watch for regression. If persistent, cryotherapy, laser, or surgical excision.

**4. Chondrodermatitis Nodularis Chronica Helicis (Winkler's Nodule)**
*   **Features:** Small, extremely **painful/tender** nodule near the free border of the helix.
*   **Demographics:** Typically affects men >50 years.
*   **Treatment:** Excision of the nodule along with the underlying cartilage.

#### B. Malignant Tumors

**1. Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**
*   **Incidence:** Most common malignant tumor of the pinna.
*   **Risk Factors:** Prolonged exposure to sunlight (UV radiation), fair complexion, chronic inflammation.
*   **Site:** **Helix** is the site of predilection.
*   **Clinical Features:** Presents as a painless nodule or ulcer with raised, everted edges and an indurated base. It infiltrates tissues rapidly but lymph node metastasis occurs late.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Small lesions: Wedge resection/local excision with a 1 cm healthy margin.
    *   Large lesions/Node metastasis: Total amputation of pinna (pinnectomy) + en bloc neck dissection/parotidectomy.

**2. Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)**
*   **Features:** Also known as **Rodent Ulcer**. Common in men >50 years.
*   **Site:** Helix and Tragus.
*   **Clinical Appearance:** Nodule with a central crust (removal causes bleeding) and a **raised/beaded/rolled-out edge**.
*   **Behavior:** Locally invasive (burrowing) but **rarely metastasizes**.
*   **Treatment:** Radiotherapy (for superficial lesions) or wide surgical excision.

**3. Malignant Melanoma**
*   **Features:** Rare but aggressive. Linked to sun exposure.
*   **Appearance:** Pigmented lesion (black mole) that changes in size or color, or bleeds.
*   **Metastasis:** High rate (16–50%).
*   **Treatment:** Wide excision, parotidectomy, and radical neck dissection.

### II. Tumors of the External Auditory Canal (EAC)

#### A. Benign Lesions

**1. Exostosis (Surfer's Ear)**
*   **Definition:** Benign bony overgrowths arising from compact bone.
*   **Etiology:** Reactive bone formation due to repeated **cold water exposure** (swimmers, surfers, divers).
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Multiple and Bilateral**.
    *   **Sessile**, smooth bony swellings.
    *   Located in the **deeper (medial)** part of the bony canal.
    *   Usually asymptomatic, but large ones cause conductive hearing loss or wax retention.
*   **Treatment:** Surgical removal (drilling) if symptomatic. **Use of gouge/hammer is avoided** due to proximity to the facial nerve.

**2. Osteoma**
*   **Definition:** True benign neoplasm arising from cancellous bone.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Single and Unilateral**.
    *   **Pedunculated** (narrow base), smooth, bony hard tumor.
    *   Located in the **lateral (outer)** part of the bony canal, often at the tympano-squamous or tympano-mastoid suture.
*   **Treatment:** Surgical excision (fracturing the pedicle or drilling).

**Comparison: Exostosis vs. Osteoma**

| Feature | Exostosis | Osteoma |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Number** | Multiple | Single |
| **Laterality** | Bilateral | Unilateral |
| **Base** | Sessile (Broad) | Pedunculated (Narrow) |
| **Location** | Medial (Deep) bony canal | Lateral (Outer) bony canal |
| **Bone Type** | Compact | Cancellous |
| **Etiology** | Cold water (Surfers) | True Tumor |

**3. Ceruminoma**
*   **Pathology:** Tumor of modified sweat glands (ceruminous glands).
*   **Features:** Smooth, firm, skin-covered polypoid swelling in the outer EAC.
*   **Clinical Implication:** High tendency to recur and may turn malignant. Malignant type outnumbers benign (2:1).
*   **Treatment:** Wide surgical excision.

#### B. Malignant Tumors

**1. Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) of EAC**
*   **Etiology:** Often associated with long-standing **chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM)** or chronic discharge.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Pain:** Severe, deep-seated otalgia (out of proportion to clinical findings).
    *   **Discharge:** Blood-stained mucopurulent otorrhea.
    *   **Mass:** Ulcerated area or bleeding polyp/granulation tissue in the meatus.
    *   **Nerve Palsy:** [[Facial Nerve]] paralysis is common due to erosion of the fallopian canal.
*   **Spread:** Can invade the parotid, temporomandibular joint, and skull base.
*   **Diagnosis:** Biopsy is mandatory for any polyp or granulation that does not heal or bleeds easily. CT scan to assess bone erosion.
*   **Treatment:** Aggressive. **Lateral temporal bone resection** (sleeve resection) or subtotal/total petrosectomy + Postoperative **Radiotherapy**.

**2. Glandular Malignancies**
*   **Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma:** Painful, slow-growing, perineural spread.
*   **Adenocarcinoma:** Rare, arises from glandular elements.

### Clinical Implications & "Case Related Viva"

*   **Pulsatile Tumor:** If a reddish-blue mass is seen in the EAC/Middle ear that blanches on pressure ([[Brown's sign]]), suspect **Glomus Tumor**, not a simple polyp. **Biopsy is CONTRAINDICATED**.
*   **Hard of Hearing in Swimmers:** Suspect **Exostosis** leading to wax impaction or canal stenosis.
*   **Bleeding Polyp:** A polyp in the ear that bleeds on touch should raise suspicion of **Malignancy** or **Glomus tumor**. Do not avulse blindly.
*   **Facial Palsy + Ear Discharge:** Highly suggestive of malignancy (SCC) or Cholesteatoma.
