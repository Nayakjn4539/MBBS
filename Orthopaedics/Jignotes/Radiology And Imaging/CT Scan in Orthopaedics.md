# [[Radiology And Imaging]] > CT Scan in Orthopaedics

### CT Scan in Orthopaedics

#### Introduction
[[Computed Tomography]] (CT) is a non-invasive diagnostic imaging modality capable of recording bone and soft-tissue outlines in cross-section. It has revolutionized orthopaedic trauma and tumor management by providing detailed, multi-planar views that plain radiographs cannot offer. While [[MRI]] is the gold standard for soft tissues, **CT is the gold standard for bony architecture**.,

#### Basic Principles
*   **Mechanism:** Uses X-ray beams to create cross-sectional images (slices) of the body.
*   **Reconstruction:** Computed data can be reconstructed to provide **[[Three-dimensional CT reconstruction]]**. This is particularly useful for understanding complex anatomy in congenital deformities (e.g., [[Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip]]) or complex fractures.,
*   **Contrast Resolution:** Better contrast resolution than plain X-ray, allowing for more refined differentiation of tissues.

#### Indications in Orthopaedics

| Category | Specific Indications |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Trauma** | • Complex intra-articular fractures (e.g., [[Tibial Plateau fractures]], [[Calcaneal fractures]]).,<br>• [[Pelvic fractures]] and Acetabular fractures.,<br>• [[Spinal fractures]] (Burst fractures, retropulsed fragments).,<br>• Fracture of the [[Scaphoid]] (to assess union/non-union).|
| **Tumors** | • [[Osteoid Osteoma]] (to localize the **[[Nidus]]**).<br>• Assessing cortical integrity and extent of bone destruction.<br>• Staging of malignant tumors (CT Chest for pulmonary metastasis).<br>• Planning limb salvage surgery.|
| **Infection** | • [[Chronic Osteomyelitis]] (to identify **[[Sequestrum]]** and **[[Involucrum]]** not visible on X-ray).,<br>• [[Tuberculosis of Spine]] (to detect small paravertebral abscesses or early bone destruction).|
| **Spine Disorders** | • [[Lumbar Canal Stenosis]] (bony stenosis, facet hypertrophy).<br>• [[Spondylolysis]] (pars interarticularis defect).<br>• Ossification of Posterior Longitudinal Ligament ([[OPLL]]).|
| **Joint Pathology** | • Loose bodies in joints.<br>• [[Tarsal Coalition]].<br>• Femoroacetabular impingement. |

#### Regional Applications and Findings

##### 1. Trauma
*   **Spine:** CT is ideal for showing structural damage to individual vertebrae and, crucially, the **displacement of bone fragments into the vertebral canal** (retropulsion), which might threaten the [[Spinal Cord]].
    *   **Clinical Implication:** In [[Polytrauma]], CT is now the method of choice for rapid assessment of the head, cervical spine, chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
*   **Pelvis and Acetabulum:** 3D reconstructions allow the surgeon to visualize the fracture geometry "in space," aiding in the planning of approach and fixation implants.,
*   **Complex Articular Fractures:**
    *   **Calcaneum:** CT is the **gold standard** to assess the articular surface of the subtalar joint.
    *   **Tibial Plateau:** To assess the amount of articular depression and comminution.

##### 2. Bone Tumors
*   **Osteoid Osteoma:** CT is the investigation of choice. It reveals a small radiolucent **[[Nidus]]** surrounded by dense sclerotic bone. It is also used to guide radiofrequency ablation probes.,
*   **Malignancy:** CT of the chest is far more sensitive than a chest X-ray for detecting pulmonary metastases in conditions like [[Osteosarcoma]].

##### 3. Infection (Osteomyelitis)
*   In [[Chronic Osteomyelitis]], sequestra (dead bone) may be obscured by thick involucrum (new bone) on plain X-rays. CT clearly differentiates the dense sequestrum lying within the medullary canal or cavity.,
*   **Spinal TB:** It can detect small paravertebral abscesses and sequestra/bony ridges pressing on the cord (Spinal Tumor Syndrome) when plain X-rays are inconclusive.

##### 4. Spinal Degeneration
*   **Spinal Stenosis:** CT combined with myelography (CT Myelogram) was historically used, but plain CT is valuable for measuring the dimensions of the [[Spinal Canal]] and identifying **lateral recess stenosis** or **foraminal stenosis** due to osteophytes.,

#### Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**
1.  **Bony Detail:** Superior to MRI for defining cortical bone architecture and fracture lines.
2.  **Speed:** Much faster than MRI, making it ideal for trauma/emergency settings.
3.  **3D Capability:** Reconstruction aids in surgical planning.
4.  **Calcification:** excellent for detecting calcified matrices (e.g., in [[Chondrosarcoma]]).

**Disadvantages:**
1.  **Radiation:** Involves relatively **high radiation exposure**. It should be used with discretion, particularly in children and pregnant women.
2.  **Soft Tissue:** Inferior contrast resolution for soft tissues (ligaments, menisci, spinal cord, bone marrow edema) compared to [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging|MRI]].,
3.  **Artifacts:** Metal implants (plates, screws, hip replacements) cause "starburst" artifacts that can obscure image details.

#### CT Guided Procedures
CT is not just diagnostic; it is used for intervention:
*   **Biopsy:** CT-guided needle biopsy is used for deep-seated lesions (e.g., vertebral bodies) to obtain tissue for histology and culture.,
*   **Ablation:** Radiofrequency ablation of [[Osteoid Osteoma]].
*   **Injections:** Selective nerve root blocks or facet joint injections.

**Clinical Implication:**
While ordering a CT scan, always specify the region of interest clearly. For intra-articular fractures, request "fine cuts" (thin slices) with 2D and 3D reconstructions. Remember that while CT is excellent for bone, if the suspicion is a stress fracture (early stage) or ligament injury, **MRI** is the preferred modality.
