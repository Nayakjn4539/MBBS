# [[Autopsy]] > Objectives and Rules of Medico-Legal Autopsy

### Objectives and Rules of Medico-Legal Autopsy

A [[Medico-legal Autopsy]] (Forensic Autopsy) is a specialized surgical procedure performed on a dead body under the authority of the law to assist the state in the administration of justice. Unlike a clinical autopsy, its primary focus is not just pathology, but the legal implications of the death.

### Objectives of Medico-Legal Autopsy

The primary aim is to answer the "Six W's": **Who** died, **When** did they die, **Where** did they die, **Why** did they die, **What** was the cause, and **Which** weapon was used.

1.  **Identify the Deceased:** To establish the [[Identity]] of the person in cases of unknown, decomposed, mutilated, or skeletal remains.
2.  **Determine Cause of Death:** To find the medical cause (pathology or injury) and distinguish between **natural** and **unnatural** causes.
3.  **Determine Manner of Death:** To interpret whether the death was Accidental, Suicidal, or Homicidal.
4.  **Estimate Time Since Death:** To determine the [[Post-mortem Interval]] (PMI) based on body changes (cooling, rigor mortis, decomposition) and stomach contents.
5.  **Collection of Evidence:** To recover and preserve physical evidence such as bullets, swabs (sexual assault), or viscera (poisoning) to identify the assailant or weapon.
6.  **Injury Interpretation:** To determine the nature, age, and severity of injuries and whether they were ante-mortem or post-mortem.
7.  **Viability of Newborn:** In cases of infant death, to determine if the child was live-born, stillborn, or dead-born and if it was viable.
8.  **Volitional Activity:** To assess if the victim could have walked, spoken, or performed actions after sustaining the fatal injury.

### Rules and Protocol for Medico-Legal Autopsy

The autopsy must be conducted with strict adherence to legal and medical protocols to ensure the evidence stands in a court of law.

#### 1. Pre-Autopsy Prerequisites
*   **Authorization:** The autopsy must *only* be conducted upon receiving a written requisition/order from a competent legal authority (Police Officer or Magistrate).
*   **Consent:** Unlike a clinical autopsy, **consent from the relatives is NOT required** for a medico-legal autopsy.
*   **Identification:** The body must be identified by the police officer accompanying it and preferably by a relative. Identification marks must be recorded by the doctor.
*   **Documentation Check:** The Medical Officer (MO) must carefully read the [[Inquest Report]], FIR, and medical records (if treated) before starting to understand the context and alleged cause of death.

#### 2. General Rules
*   **Location:** It should be performed in an authorized mortuary. Spot autopsies are done only in exceptional cases (e.g., extreme putrefaction preventing transport).
*   **Timing:** Ideally performed in **daylight**. Color changes (e.g., jaundice, cherry-red lividity in CO poisoning, bruising stages) are best appreciated in natural light. However, it can be done at night if sufficient artificial lighting is available.
*   **Privacy:** No unauthorized persons should be present during the examination.
*   **Completeness:** The autopsy must be **complete**. "A poor autopsy is worse than no autopsy." All three major cavities (Cranial, Thoracic, and Abdominal) must be opened and examined, regardless of the apparent cause of death.

#### 3. Examination Proper
*   **External Examination:** This is the most important part.
    *   Examine clothing for stains, tears, or drag marks.
    *   Photograph the body and injuries.
    *   Document rigor mortis, lividity, and decomposition.
    *   Describe injuries meticulously (Type, Size, Shape, Site).
    *   **> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Body charts showing location of injuries**
*   **Internal Examination:**
    *   Standard incisions (I-shaped or Y-shaped) should be used.
    *   Organs should be dissected personally by the doctor, not the mortuary attendant.
    *   Neck dissection should be done *last* in asphyxial deaths to maintain a "bloodless field" and avoid artefactual hemorrhages (Prinsloo Gordon artifact).

#### 4. Preservation of Viscera
Viscera must be preserved for chemical analysis in the following cases:
*   Suspected poisoning or intoxication.
*   Obscure cases where the cause of death is not visible at autopsy.
*   Advanced decomposition.
*   Homicides (to rule out incapacitation by drugs).

#### 5. Post-Autopsy Duties
*   **Reconstruction:** The body must be stitched, washed, and restored to the best possible cosmetic appearance before handing over.
*   **Chain of Custody:** Samples (viscera, bullets, clothes) must be sealed, labeled, and handed over to the police constable under a proper receipt to maintain the [[Chain of Evidence]].
*   **Report:** The post-mortem report must be written immediately (contemporaneously) to avoid memory errors. It should be objective, without erasures, and signed. The cause of death should be precise; avoid terms like "heart failure" or "asphyxia" without specifying the underlying pathology.

### Medicolegal Aspects

*   **Section 174 CrPC:** Police Inquest (authorizes autopsy in cases of suicide, accident, etc.).
*   **Section 176 CrPC:** Magistrate Inquest (authorizes autopsy in custodial deaths, dowry deaths, or police firing).
*   **Refusal to Autopsy:** A doctor working in a government authorized center cannot refuse to conduct a medico-legal autopsy if the inquest order is valid.
*   **Confidentiality:** The post-mortem report is a confidential document and should be handed over to the Investigating Officer (IO), not directly to the relatives.
