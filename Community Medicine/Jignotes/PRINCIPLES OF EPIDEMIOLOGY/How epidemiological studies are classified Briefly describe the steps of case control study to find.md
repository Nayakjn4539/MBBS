# [[PRINCIPLES OF EPIDEMIOLOGY]] > How epidemiological studies are classified? Briefly describe the steps of case control study to find out the association between lung cancer and smoking.

### **CLASSIFICATION OF EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES**

Epidemiological studies are broadly classified into two main categories based on the role of the investigator: **Observational** (investigator measures but does not intervene) and **Experimental** (investigator intervenes/manipulates variables),.

**1. Observational Studies**
*   **Descriptive Studies** (Hypothesis Formulation)
    *   Case Reports
    *   Case Series
    *   Descriptive Cross-sectional surveys (Prevalence studies)
    *   Ecological Descriptive studies,,
*   **Analytical Studies** (Hypothesis Testing)
    *   Ecological or Correlational studies (Unit of study: Population)
    *   Cross-sectional or Prevalence studies (Unit of study: Individual)
    *   **[[Case Control Study]]** (Retrospective/Backward-looking)
    *   **[[Cohort Study]]** (Prospective/Forward-looking)

**2. Experimental Studies** (Intervention Studies/Hypothesis Confirmation),
*   **[[Randomized Controlled Trials]]** (Clinical trials) - Unit of study: Patients
*   **Field Trials** - Unit of study: Healthy people
*   **Community Trials** - Unit of study: Communities

### **STEPS OF CASE CONTROL STUDY**
*(Example: Association between Lung Cancer and Smoking)*

A **[[Case Control Study]]** is a retrospective study that proceeds from **"effect to cause"**. Both exposure (smoking) and outcome (lung cancer) have occurred before the start of the study. The four basic steps are:

#### **1. Selection of Cases and Controls**
*   **Selection of Cases:**
    *   The first step is to identify a suitable group of "Cases". In this scenario, these are patients diagnosed with **[[Lung Cancer]]**.
    *   **Diagnostic Criteria:** The definition of a case must be specified precisely (e.g., histologically confirmed lung cancer).
    *   **Source:** Cases can be drawn from hospitals (hospital-based) or the general population (population-based).
*   **Selection of Controls:**
    *   "Controls" must be free from the disease under study (i.e., **free from Lung Cancer**).
    *   They must be as similar to the cases as possible, except for the absence of the disease.
    *   **Source:** Controls can be selected from hospitals (patients with other diseases not related to smoking), relatives, neighbors, or the general population.

#### **2. Matching**
*   This process involves selecting controls that share specific characteristics with the cases to ensure comparability.
*   **Purpose:** To eliminate **[[Confounding Factors]]** (variables associated with both exposure and disease),.
*   *Example:* If the lung cancer group consists mostly of older males, the control group should also consist of older males. Matching is usually done for **Age**, **Sex**, and **Occupation**.
*   *Note:* Do **not** match the suspected factor (Smoking), or its etiological role cannot be studied.

#### **3. Measurement of Exposure**
*   Information regarding the exposure (**[[Smoking]]**) is obtained from both cases and controls.
*   **Method:** Interviews, questionnaires, or studying past hospital/employment records.
*   **Requirement:** Information must be obtained in precisely the same manner for both groups to avoid **[[Recall Bias]]** (cases might remember smoking history better than controls),.

#### **4. Analysis and Interpretation**
The final step is to analyze the data to find exposure rates and estimate the risk.

*   **A. Exposure Rates:** Calculate the frequency of smoking in both groups.
    *   If the exposure rate (smoking history) is significantly higher in cases (lung cancer patients) than in controls, an association exists.
*   **B. Estimation of Risk ([[Odds Ratio]]):**
    *   Since incidence cannot be calculated in case-control studies, **Relative Risk (RR)** cannot be calculated directly. Instead, we calculate the **Odds Ratio (OR)**.

**The 2x2 Table for Lung Cancer and Smoking:**

| | **Cases (Lung Cancer)** | **Controls (No Lung Cancer)** |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Smokers (Exposed)** | **a** | **b** |
| **Non-Smokers (Non-exposed)** | **c** | **d** |

**Formula for Odds Ratio (Cross-product ratio):**
$$OR = \frac{ad}{bc}$$

*   **Interpretation:**
    *   **OR > 1:** Positive association (Smoking is a risk factor for Lung Cancer).
    *   **OR = 1:** No association.
    *   **OR < 1:** Negative association (Protective factor).

> **Clinical Relevance:** The classic study by **Doll and Hill** (1950) was a case-control study that first established the strong link between smoking and lung cancer, leading to major public health interventions against tobacco use,.
