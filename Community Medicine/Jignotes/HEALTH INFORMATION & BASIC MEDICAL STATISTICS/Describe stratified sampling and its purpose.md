# [[HEALTH INFORMATION & BASIC MEDICAL STATISTICS]] > Describe stratified sampling and its purpose

### Stratified Random Sampling

**Definition**
[[Stratified Random Sampling]] is a method of **probability sampling** used when the population under study is **not homogeneous** (heterogeneous). The entire population is first divided into homogeneous subgroups or classes called **strata** (singular: stratum) based on specific characteristics (e.g., age, sex, socioeconomic status, religion). A random sample is then drawn from *each* stratum, usually in proportion to its size in the total population.

**Methodology**
1.  **Identification:** The non-homogeneous population is converted into **homogeneous groups** (strata).
2.  **Allocation:** The size of the sample to be drawn from each stratum is determined. This is usually **proportionate** to the size of that stratum in the universe (population).
3.  **Selection:** Units are selected from *each* stratum using [[Simple Random Sampling]] techniques.

**Purpose and Advantages**
*   **Ensures Representation:** It guarantees that every segment of the population (even minority groups) is adequately represented. None of the categories are under or over-represented.
*   **Greater Accuracy:** It provides a more representative sample than simple random sampling for a given large population, thereby increasing the [[Precision]] of the result.
*   **Comparison:** It allows for the statistical comparison of subgroups (e.g., comparing disease prevalence between different age groups or social classes).
*   **Administrative Convenience:** It enables the use of existing administrative divisions (like wards or districts) as strata.

**Clinical/Public Health Example**
*   **Scenario:** A researcher wants to estimate the mean Hemoglobin (Hb) level in a population of 1,000 people.
*   **Problem:** The population is not homogeneous regarding Hb levels (females generally have lower Hb than males).
*   **Population Composition:** 700 Males and 300 Females.
*   **Sample Required:** 100 people.
*   **Application of Stratified Sampling:**
    *   The population is divided into two strata: Males and Females.
    *   To maintain proportionality, the researcher randomly selects **70 males** (from the 700) and **30 females** (from the 300).
    *   This ensures the sample accurately reflects the sex composition of the original population.

**Mnemonic**
To remember the concept of Stratified Sampling: **"S-P-L-I-T"**

*   **S** - **S**eparate the population
*   **P** - **P**roportionate number selected
*   **L** - **L**ayers (Strata)
*   **I** - **I**nto Homogeneous groups
*   **T** - **T**hen Randomly select
