# [[Lower Limb]] > Knee Dislocation and Vascular Injury

### Knee Dislocation and Vascular Injury

[[Knee dislocation]] is a severe, limb-threatening injury involving the disruption of the relationship between the [[tibia]] and the [[femur]]. It typically involves the rupture of at least two of the four major ligaments ([[ACL]], [[PCL]], [[MCL]], [[LCL]]) and carries a notoriously high risk of neurovascular damage.

#### 1. Classification
Dislocations are classified based on the displacement of the tibia relative to the femur.

| Type | Frequency | Mechanism | Associated Risks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Anterior** | Most Common | Hyperextension of the knee | High risk of intimal tear of the [[popliteal artery]] due to traction. |
| **Posterior** | 2nd Most Common | "Dashboard injury" (Axial load on flexed knee) | High risk of complete transaction of the popliteal artery. |
| **Lateral** | Less Common | Violent abduction force | Usually involves ACL, PCL, and MCL rupture. |
| **Medial** | Less Common | Violent adduction force | Usually involves ACL, PCL, and LCL rupture. |
| **Rotational** | Rare | Rotational force | Posterolateral corner injury; difficult to reduce (buttonholing of femoral condyle). |

**Schenck Classification (Anatomic):**
*   **KD I:** Cruciate intact (unilocular) - rare.
*   **KD II:** Both cruciates torn (ACL + PCL).
*   **KD III:** Both cruciates + one collateral torn (ACL + PCL + MCL/LCL).
*   **KD IV:** All four ligaments torn (ACL + PCL + MCL + LCL).
*   **KD V:** Fracture-dislocation.

#### 2. Pathoanatomy and Vascular Risk
The high association with [[popliteal artery]] injury is due to the unique anatomy of the popliteal fossa.

*   **The "Bowstring" Effect:** The [[popliteal artery]] is tethered proximally at the **adductor hiatus** (Hunter's canal) and distally by the fibrous arch of the **soleus muscle**.
*   **Mechanism:** When the knee dislocates, the artery is stretched across the posterior aspect of the joint like a bowstring.
*   **Types of Injury:**
    *   **Traction Injury:** Common in anterior dislocation. Leads to **intimal tears**. The intima may curl up and cause thrombosis hours after the injury, even if distal pulses are palpable initially.
    *   **Laceration/Transection:** Common in posterior dislocation due to the backward displacement of the tibial plateau.

#### 3. Clinical Features
*   **History:** High-velocity trauma (RTA) or sports injury.
*   **Deformity:** Gross deformity is usually obvious. However, up to **50% of dislocations spontaneously reduce** before arrival at the hospital.
    *   *Clinical Implication:* A swollen, unstable knee with "doughy" feeling ([[haemarthrosis]]) after significant trauma should be treated as a dislocation until proven otherwise.
*   **Instability:** Gross multidirectional instability (demonstrable under anesthesia).
*   **Skin:** Look for dimpling (buttonholing) or open wounds.

#### 4. Neurovascular Assessment (Crucial Step)
A systematic evaluation is mandatory because vascular injury determines limb survival.

**Vascular Assessment:**
*   **Palpation:** Check Dorsalis Pedis and Posterior Tibial pulses.
*   **Hard Signs of Vascular Injury:**
    1.  Absent or diminished distal pulses.
    2.  Active pulsatile hemorrhage.
    3.  Expanding/pulsatile [[hematoma]].
    4.  Palpable thrill or audible bruit.
    5.  Signs of distal ischemia (Pale, cool limb).
*   **Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI):** If ABI is < 0.9, it indicates a vascular injury requiring further investigation (CT Angio).

**Neurological Assessment:**
*   **Common Peroneal Nerve (CPN):** Most commonly injured nerve (approx. 25%), especially in posterolateral dislocations or varus injuries.
*   **Signs:** [[Foot drop]] (inability to dorsiflex) and loss of sensation over the first web space (deep peroneal) and dorsum of foot (superficial peroneal).
*   **Tibial Nerve:** Less commonly injured; causes weakness in plantar flexion.

#### 5. Diagnosis and Imaging
1.  **X-Rays (AP and Lateral):** Confirms dislocation and identifies associated fractures (tibial spine, Segond fracture).
2.  **Doppler Ultrasound:** Non-invasive test to exclude occult arterial trauma.
3.  **CT Angiography:** Gold standard for diagnosing intimal tears or occlusion if ABI is abnormal or clinical suspicion is high.
4.  **MRI:** Gold standard for assessing soft tissues (ligaments, menisci) but is usually done after the acute phase is stabilized.

#### 6. Management

**A. Emergency Reduction**
*   **Principle:** Reduction is an emergency. Do not wait for X-rays if the limb is ischemic.
*   **Technique:** Closed reduction under sedation/anesthesia.
    *   Traction is applied to the leg.
    *   For **Anterior**: Lift the distal femur while applying traction.
    *   For **Posterior**: Lift the proximal tibia to bring it forward.
*   **Post-Reduction:** Re-assess neurovascular status immediately.

**B. Vascular Management**
*   If pulses are absent after reduction $\rightarrow$ Immediate surgical exploration (on-table angiogram may be done).
*   **Repair:** End-to-end anastomosis or reverse saphenous vein graft.
*   **Timeframe:** Revascularization must occur within **6-8 hours** to prevent amputation.
*   **Sequence:** If unstable, temporary external fixation may be applied, followed by vascular repair.

**C. Orthopaedic Management**
*   **Immobilization:** Knee should be splinted in **15-20° of flexion**.
    *   *Clinical Implication:* Never immobilize a reduced knee dislocation in full extension or hyperextension, as this puts tension on the repaired vessels and posterior capsule.
*   **External Fixation:** Indicated if the knee is grossly unstable after reduction or if vascular repair requires rigid stability.
*   **Ligament Reconstruction:** Usually delayed (2-3 weeks) until the vascular status is stable and soft tissue swelling subsides. Acute repair is reserved for open injuries or avulsions.

**D. Fasciotomy**
*   High risk of [[compartment syndrome]] due to reperfusion injury after vascular repair or massive soft tissue swelling.
*   **Double incision fasciotomy** of the leg should be performed prophylactically or therapeutically if ischemia time was prolonged.

#### 7. Complications
*   **Vascular Insufficiency:** Leading to amputation.
*   **Compartment Syndrome:** Requires vigilant monitoring.
*   **Joint Stiffness (Arthrofibrosis):** Common due to prolonged immobilization.
*   **Chronic Instability:** If ligament reconstruction fails or is inadequate.
*   **Heterotopic Ossification:** Calcification of soft tissues around the knee (Pellegrini-Stieda lesion).

**Mnemonic for Popliteal Artery Risk:**
**"P-O-P"**
*   **P**opliteal artery is fixed.
*   **O**pposite direction (Traction/Hyperextension).
*   **P**erilous (High risk of amputation).
