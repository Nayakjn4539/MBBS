# [[Bone Tumors]] > Metastatic Bone Diseases

# Metastatic Bone Diseases (Secondary Bone Tumors)

**Metastatic bone diseases** are cancerous tumors originating in other organs and involving the skeletal structures. They are the most common malignant tumors of the bone, significantly outnumbering primary bone tumors.

### Epidemiology and Etiology
*   **Incidence:** Common in middle to late life (> 40–50 years).
*   **Spread:** The most common route is **hematogenous** (blood-borne). Direct extension is rare.
*   **Predilection:** Metastases favor bones containing **red marrow** due to high vascularity.
    *   **Common Sites:** [[Vertebrae]] (most common), Pelvis, Ribs, Skull, Proximal Femur, and Proximal Humerus.
    *   **Rare Sites:** Bones distal to the elbow and knee (Acral metastasis).

**Common Primary Sources (Mnemonic: Pb KTL "Lead Kettle")**
1.  **P**rostate
2.  **B**reast (Most common source in females)
3.  **K**idney (Renal Cell Carcinoma)
4.  **T**hyroid
5.  **L**ung (Most common source in males)

### Classification: Lytic vs. Blastic Metastases

The radiographic appearance of bone metastases depends on the interaction between tumor cells and bone remodeling cells ([[osteoclasts]] and [[osteoblasts]]).

#### 1. Osteolytic Metastasis (Bone Destroying)
*   **Mechanism:** Tumor cells secrete factors (e.g., PTHrP, IL-6) that stimulate **osteoclasts**, leading to bone resorption and destruction.
*   **Radiographic Appearance:** Radiolucent, "punched-out" lesions, moth-eaten appearance, or permeative destruction. No reactive new bone.
*   **Primary Sources:**
    *   [[Renal Cell Carcinoma]] (Kidney)
    *   [[Thyroid Carcinoma]] (Follicular type)
    *   Lung Cancer (Non-small cell)
    *   Gastrointestinal tract
    *   **Note:** [[Multiple Myeloma]] is a primary bone tumor but presents as purely lytic lesions.

#### 2. Osteoblastic / Sclerotic Metastasis (Bone Forming)
*   **Mechanism:** Tumor cells secrete factors (e.g., Endothelin-1) that stimulate **osteoblasts**, leading to excessive, unregulated new bone formation.
*   **Radiographic Appearance:** Radiodense, white, sclerotic patches. "Cotton wool" spots or generalized increase in density.
*   **Primary Sources:**
    *   [[Prostate Carcinoma]] (Classic example)
    *   Carcinoids
    *   Medulloblastoma
    *   Small cell lung cancer

#### 3. Mixed Metastasis
*   **Mechanism:** Both osteolytic and osteoblastic activity occur simultaneously.
*   **Primary Sources:**
    *   [[Breast Carcinoma]] (Most common mixed lesion)
    *   Lung Cancer
    *   Ovarian Cancer

**Table: Comparison of Metastatic Lesion Types**

| Feature | Osteolytic | Osteoblastic (Sclerotic) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pathology** | Bone destruction > formation | Bone formation > destruction |
| **Key Cell** | [[Osteoclast]] stimulation | [[Osteoblast]] stimulation |
| **X-ray** | Dark/Black (Radiolucent) | White/Bright (Radiodense) |
| **Classic Source**| **Kidney, Thyroid** | **Prostate** |
| **Complication**| High risk of [[pathological fracture]] | Stiff bone, pain |

> **Clinical Insight:** A "Bone to Bone" metastasis (metastasis from a primary bone sarcoma to another bone) is most commonly seen in **Ewing's Sarcoma** and **Osteosarcoma**.

### Clinical Features
1.  **Pain:** Most common symptom. Constant, boring, worse at night. Often precedes X-ray changes.
2.  **Pathological Fracture:** Fracture occurring with trivial trauma. Common in the proximal femur and humerus.
3.  **Neurological Symptoms:** Due to spinal cord or nerve root compression (e.g., paraplegia, radiculopathy).
4.  **Systemic Signs:** Anemia, weight loss, cachexia, fever.
5.  **Hypercalcemia:** "Bones, stones, abdominal groans, and psychic moans."

### Diagnostic Investigation

#### 1. Radiological Examination (X-ray)
*   **Limitations:** A lesion is visible on plain X-ray only after **30–50%** of bone mineral content is lost.
*   **Spine:**
    *   **Winking Owl Sign:** Destruction of a single pedicle on the AP view. (Early sign of spinal metastasis).
    *   **Vertebral Collapse:** Wedge compression fracture.
    *   **Ivory Vertebra:** Homogeneously dense vertebra (seen in Prostate CA, Hodgkin's lymphoma).

#### 2. Bone Scan ([[Bone Scintigraphy]])
*   Uses **Technetium-99m (Tc-99)**.
*   **Sensitivity:** High. Best screening tool for skeletal metastases. Can detect lesions months before X-ray.
*   **Appearance:** Multiple "Hot spots" (increased uptake) throughout the skeleton.
*   **False Negatives:** Purely lytic lesions (e.g., Multiple Myeloma) may not show up because they lack osteoblastic reaction.

#### 3. CT Scan and MRI
*   **CT:** Best for assessing cortical destruction and risk of fracture. Used to search for primary (Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis).
*   **MRI:** Best for assessing soft tissue extension and **spinal cord compression**. Can detect marrow infiltration early.

#### 4. PET Scan (FDG-PET)
*   Detects metabolic activity. Useful for both bone and soft tissue metastases.

#### 5. Laboratory Investigation
*   **Serum Calcium:** Often elevated (Hypercalcemia of malignancy).
*   **Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP):** Elevated in osteoblastic metastasis; may be normal in pure lytic lesions.
*   **Acid Phosphatase & PSA:** Elevated in [[Prostate Carcinoma]].
*   **Biopsy:** **Gold standard** for definitive diagnosis if the primary is unknown.

### Management Principles

The goal is usually **palliative** (pain relief, function preservation) rather than curative.

#### 1. Medical Management
*   **Pain Control:** WHO analgesic ladder (NSAIDs, Opioids).
*   **Bisphosphonates:** (e.g., Zoledronic acid) Inhibit osteoclasts, reduce pain, and prevent fractures (especially in lytic lesions).
*   **Denosumab:** RANK-ligand inhibitor.
*   **Chemotherapy/Hormonal Therapy:** Directed at the primary tumor (e.g., Anti-androgens for Prostate, Tamoxifen/Aromatase inhibitors for Breast).

#### 2. Radiotherapy
*   Highly effective for pain control in localized lesions.
*   Used post-operatively after fixation.

#### 3. Surgical Management
**Indications:**
*   Impending pathological fracture.
*   Actual pathological fracture.
*   Intractable pain resistant to radiation.
*   Spinal instability or neurological deficit.

**Prophylactic Fixation (Mirels' Score):**
Used to predict the risk of fracture and need for prophylactic surgery. Based on:
1.  **Site** (Upper limb < Lower limb < Peritrochanteric).
2.  **Pain** (Mild < Moderate < Functional).
3.  **Lesion Type** (Blastic < Mixed < Lytic).
4.  **Size** (<1/3 < 1/3-2/3 > 2/3 of bone width).
*   **Score > 9:** Prophylactic internal fixation is indicated.

**Surgical Options:**
*   **Intramedullary Nailing:** Preferred for long bones (femur/humerus). Allows immediate weight bearing.
*   **Prosthetic Replacement:** For articular/metaphyseal fractures (e.g., Hemiarthroplasty for femoral neck).
*   **Spinal Decompression:** Laminectomy + Stabilization.
