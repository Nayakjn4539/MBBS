# [[Leukocoria]] (White Pupillary Reflex)

**Definition**: [[Leukocoria]] (Amaurotic cat’s eye reflex) refers to a whitish, pinkish, or yellowish-white pupillary reflex seen instead of the normal red fundal glow. It indicates a loss of transparency of structures behind the pupil or the presence of a white mass within the eye.

**Clinical Implication**: It is the most common presenting sign of [[Retinoblastoma]] (60% of cases). Every case of leukocoria in a child must be considered Retinoblastoma until proven otherwise to save life and vision.

### Differential Diagnosis (Etiology)

Conditions mimicking retinoblastoma are collectively termed **[[Pseudoglioma]]**.

#### Common Causes
1.  **[[Congenital Cataract]]**: The most common cause of leukocoria in general.
2.  **[[Retinoblastoma]]**: The most common primary intraocular malignancy in children.
3.  **[[Retinopathy of Prematurity]] (ROP)**: Previously known as retrolental fibroplasia.
4.  **[[Persistent Hyperplastic Primary Vitreous]] (PHPV)** / Persistent Fetal Vasculature (PFVS): Failure of the primary vitreous to regress.
5.  **[[Coats' Disease]]**: Retinal telangiectasia with exudation.
6.  **[[Ocular Toxocariasis]]**: Nematode infestation.

#### Less Common Causes
*   **[[Retinal Detachment]]** (long-standing).
*   **[[Coloboma]]** of the choroid/optic disc (large).
*   **[[Retinal Dysplasia]]** / Norrie disease.
*   **[[Endophthalmitis]]** (Metastatic/Fungal).
*   **[[Cyclitic Membrane]]** (Uveitis).
*   **[[Medulloepithelioma]]** (Diktyoma).
*   **[[Retinal Astrocytoma]]**.
*   **Organized [[Vitreous Hemorrhage]]**.

**Mnemonic for Causes of Leukocoria: "C P R"**
*   **C**: [[Congenital Cataract]], [[Coats' Disease]], [[Coloboma]], [[Cyclitic Membrane]]
*   **P**: [[PHPV]] (Persistent Hyperplastic Primary Vitreous)
*   **R**: [[Retinoblastoma]], [[Retinopathy of Prematurity]], [[Retinal Detachment]], [[Retinal Dysplasia]]

### Differentiating Features of Major Causes

| Feature | [[Retinoblastoma]] | [[Congenital Cataract]] | [[PHPV]] / PFVS | [[Coats' Disease]] | [[Retinopathy of Prematurity]] (ROP) | [[Ocular Toxocariasis]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Laterality** | Unilateral (75%) or Bilateral (25%) | Bilateral (common) or Unilateral | Unilateral (90%) | Unilateral (mostly) | Bilateral | Unilateral |
| **Age/History** | 1–2 years (avg); 90% <3 years | Present at birth/infancy | Present at birth (full term) | First decade (Boys > Girls) | Preterm, Low birth weight, O2 therapy | History of pica (eating dirt), contact with puppies |
| **IOP** | **Normal or Raised** (Secondary Glaucoma) | Normal | **Low** (Microphthalmos) or High (Angle closure) | Raised in late stages (NVG) | Normal or Low (Raised in angle closure) | Low (Hypotony) or Raised (Sec. Glaucoma) |
| **Eye Size** | Normal or Buphthalmos (Enlarged) | Normal (or Microcornea) | **Microphthalmos** | Normal | Normal | Normal |
| **Calcification (CT/USG)** | **Present** (75% cases - Pathognomonic) | Absent | Absent | Absent | Absent | Rare (Absent) |
| **Key Signs** | Intratumoral vascularization, Chalky white mass | Opacity in lens | Elongated ciliary processes, Hyaloid artery remnant | Telangiectasia, yellow subretinal exudates | Fibrovascular proliferation, Tractional RD | Vitreous traction bands, Granuloma |

### Diagnostic Work-Up

A systematic approach is required to rule out malignancy ([[Retinoblastoma]]).

#### 1. Detailed History
*   **Age of onset**: RB usually <3 years; Coats' ~5-8 years.
*   **Prenatal/Birth History**: Prematurity and Oxygen therapy points to [[Retinopathy of Prematurity]]. Maternal infection (Rubella) points to [[Congenital Cataract]].
*   **Family History**: Positive in 6-10% of Retinoblastoma.
*   **Contact with pets**: Suggests [[Toxocariasis]].

#### 2. Ocular Examination (Examination Under Anesthesia - EUA)
Required in young children for thorough assessment.
*   **Anterior Segment**: Check for cataract, persistent pupillary membrane, corneal diameter (microphthalmos in [[PHPV]]).
*   **IOP Measurement**: Raised in RB; Low in many pseudogliomas (e.g., chronic uveitis).
*   **Fundoscopy (Indirect)**:
    *   **RB**: White/pearly pink mass, vascularization on surface, cottage cheese calcification (Endophytic) or Exudative RD (Exophytic).
    *   **Coats'**: Yellow exudates, telangiectatic vessels.
    *   **Toxocara**: Peripheral granuloma, vitreous bands.

#### 3. Imaging Studies
*   **B-Scan Ultrasonography (USG)**:
    *   **[[Retinoblastoma]]**: Mass with high internal reflectivity. **Calcification** (acoustic shadowing) is highly specific.
    *   **[[PHPV]]**: Band extending from optic disc to posterior lens capsule.
    *   **[[Coats' Disease]]**: Retinal detachment, no calcification.
*   **CT Scan**:
    *   Detects **intraocular calcification** (seen in 75% of RB).
    *   Evaluates extraocular extension and optic nerve involvement.
    *   *Note*: Used sparingly due to radiation risk in RB patients (risk of secondary sarcomas).
*   **MRI**:
    *   Superior for soft tissue and optic nerve evaluation.
    *   Used to rule out **Trilateral Retinoblastoma** (associated pinealoblastoma).
    *   Differentiates RB (dark on T2) from exudative detachments like Coats' (bright on T2).

#### 4. Laboratory Tests
*   **ELISA**: For [[Toxocara]] titers.
*   **LDH Levels**: Raised in aqueous humor in RB (ratio aqueous:plasma > 1.0).
*   **FNAB**: Generally **contraindicated** in RB due to risk of extraocular spread.

### Management Principles

Treatment depends entirely on the specific cause identified.

#### 1. Retinoblastoma
*   **Goal**: Save life (primary), Save eye/vision (secondary).
*   **Chemoreduction (Systemic Chemotherapy)**: Mainstay to shrink tumor (Vincristine, Etoposide, Carboplatin - VEC regimen).
*   **Focal Therapy** (after chemoreduction):
    *   **Cryotherapy**: For anterior tumors.
    *   **Laser Photocoagulation / TTT**: For posterior tumors.
    *   **Brachytherapy** (Plaque Radiotherapy): For localized residue/recurrence.
*   **Enucleation**: For large tumors (Group E), optic nerve invasion, or painful blind eyes.
*   **External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT)**: Reserved for orphan eyes or extensive recurrence (risk of secondary malignancy).

#### 2. Congenital Cataract
*   **Visually Insignificant**: Observation.
*   **Visually Significant (Dense)**: Early surgery (Lensectomy/Aspiration) + Visual rehabilitation (Contact lenses/IOL) to prevent stimulus deprivation [[Amblyopia]].
    *   Bilateral: Operate within 6 weeks.
    *   Unilateral: Operate as early as possible (days).

#### 3. Coats' Disease
*   **Early stages**: Laser photocoagulation or Cryotherapy to destroy telangiectatic vessels.
*   **Advanced stages** (Retinal Detachment): Surgical reattachment (difficult prognosis).

#### 4. PHPV / PFVS
*   **Observation**: If mild.
*   **Surgery**: Lensectomy + Vitrectomy + removal of membrane if complications arise (glaucoma, severe opacity). Prognosis is generally poor.

#### 5. Retinopathy of Prematurity
*   **Laser Photocoagulation**: Ablation of avascular retina for threshold disease.
*   **Anti-VEGF**: Emerging therapy.
*   **Surgery**: Vitrectomy for Stage 4/5 RD.

#### 6. Ocular Toxocariasis
*   **Medical**: Periocular/Systemic steroids to reduce inflammation.
*   **Surgical**: Vitrectomy for tractional bands/RD.
