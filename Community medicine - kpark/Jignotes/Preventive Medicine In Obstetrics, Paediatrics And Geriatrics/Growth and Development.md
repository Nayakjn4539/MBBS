# [[Preventive Medicine In Obstetrics, Paediatrics And Geriatrics]] > Growth and Development

### Growth and Development (Growth Charts)

**Growth and Development** are vital indicators of a child's health status.
*   **Growth:** Refers to an increase in the physical size of the body (e.g., height, weight). It is quantitative.
*   **Development:** Refers to an increase in skills and functions (e.g., motor, social, emotional). It is qualitative.

### Determinants of Growth
Growth is influenced by multiple factors, often described as the "Nature vs. Nurture" interaction.
1.  **Genetic Inheritance:** Determines potential height, weight, and mental development.
2.  **Nutrition:** The most important postnatal factor. Growth retardation is the first sign of [[malnutrition]].
3.  **Age:** Fastest growth occurs during fetal life, 1st year of life, and [[puberty]].
4.  **Sex:** Boys are generally heavier/taller at birth; girls have an earlier pubertal growth spurt (10-11 years) than boys (12-13 years).
5.  **Infections:** Recurrent infections (diarrhea, measles) slow down growth.
6.  **Socio-economic factors:** Poverty, family size, and maternal education.

### Growth Monitoring
This is the regular measurement of growth to detect deviation from normal physical growth early.
*   **Objective:** To prevent protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) rather than just treating it.
*   **Best Parameter:** **Weight** is the single best parameter for assessing physical growth because it is the most sensitive to recent nutritional stress.
*   **Frequency:**
    *   Birth to 1 year: Monthly.
    *   2nd year: Every 2 months.
    *   3 to 5 years: Every 3 months.

### The Growth Chart (Road-to-Health Chart)
A visible display of a child's physical growth and development designed for longitudinal follow-up.

*   **Designer:** First designed by **[[David Morley]]** and later modified by WHO.
*   **Principle:** It is plotted between **Weight (Y-axis)** and **Age (X-axis)**.
*   **Passport to Health:** It acts as a comprehensive record of the child's health history.

#### 1. Reference Standards
*   **NCHS Standards (Old):** Based on US children who were mostly formula-fed.
*   **WHO Child Growth Standards 2006 (Current):**
    *   Adopted by the Government of India (Integrated Child Development Services - [[ICDS]]) in 2009.
    *   **Basis:** [[Multicentre Growth Reference Study]] (MGRS).
    *   **Key Feature:** Based on **exclusively breastfed infants** as the normative model for growth and development.
    *   **Usage:** Separate charts for Boys (Blue border) and Girls (Pink border).

#### 2. Components of the New ICDS Growth Chart
The chart uses **Z-scores** (Standard Deviations) rather than percentiles. It contains three curves forming color-coded zones.

| Zone Color | Z-Score Range | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Green** | Median to -2 SD | **Normal Nutritional Status** |
| **Yellow** | -2 SD to -3 SD | **Moderately Underweight** |
| **Orange** | Below -3 SD | **Severely Underweight** (Needs urgent attention/referral) |

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a graph with Age on X-axis and Weight on Y-axis. Show three curves sloping upwards. Label the top area Green, middle Yellow, and bottom Orange. Label the curves as Median, -2SD, and -3SD.

#### 3. Interpretation of the Growth Curve
The **direction** of the curve is more important than the position of a single dot.

*   **Upward Curve:** $\uparrow$ **Good.** The child is growing well.
*   **Flat Curve:** $\rightarrow$ **Danger.** Stagnation. No weight gain. Needs investigation.
*   **Downward Curve:** $\downarrow$ **Very Dangerous.** Loss of weight. Needs immediate referral/intervention.

### Assessment of Malnutrition (Anthropometric Indices)

Different indices indicate different types of malnutrition:

| Index | Type of Malnutrition | Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Weight for Age** | **Underweight** | Composite measure of both acute and chronic malnutrition. Used in growth charts. |
| **Height for Age** | **[[Stunting]]** | Indicates **Chronic** (past) malnutrition (long-term growth failure). |
| **Weight for Height**| **[[Wasting]]** | Indicates **Acute** (current) malnutrition/emaciation. |

*Mnemonic:*
*   **WA**sting = **W**eight for **H**eight (Acute)
*   **S**tunting = **H**eight for **A**ge (Chronic) -> *Short*

#### Classifications of Malnutrition

**A. Gomez Classification** (Based on Weight for Age):
*   **Normal:** 90–110% of reference.
*   **Grade I (Mild):** 75–89%.
*   **Grade II (Moderate):** 60–74%.
*   **Grade III (Severe):** < 60%.

**B. Waterlow’s Classification**:
*   Distinguishes between Wasting (Acute) and Stunting (Chronic).

### Uses of the Growth Chart
The growth chart is a multipurpose tool, essential for the [[Under-Fives Clinic]].

**Mnemonic: G-D-P-E-T**
1.  **G - Growth Monitoring:** To visualize growth trends.
2.  **D - Diagnostic Tool:** Identifying "high-risk" children (e.g., flat curve = early PEM).
3.  **P - Planning and Policy:** Grading malnutrition helps in resource allocation and decision making.
4.  **E - Educational Tool:** Visual nature helps educate mothers about the relationship between diet and growth.
5.  **T - Tool for Teaching/Action:** Helps health workers determine the type of intervention needed (e.g., supplementary nutrition vs. referral).

**Other Information Recorded on the Chart:**
*   Identification/Registration.
*   Birth weight (Doubles by 5 months, Triples by 1 year).
*   [[Immunization]] status.
*   Significant illnesses (Diarrhea, Measles).
*   Introduction of supplementary food (Weaning).
