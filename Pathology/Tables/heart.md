| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Myocardial Infarction (MI)** Death of cardiac muscle due to prolonged ischemia. Commonly referred to as a "heart attack". | * >90% of cases: Obstructive atherosclerotic lesions in epicardial coronary arteries (Coronary Artery Disease). * ~10% of cases: Coronary artery vasospasm, emboli from various sources (atrial fibrillation, endocarditis), vasculitis, sickle cell disease, amyloid deposition, vascular dissection. | * Standard atherosclerotic risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, smoking, hyperlipidemia). * Increasing age. * Male gender. * Postmenopausal state in women. | **1. Coronary Arterial Occlusion:**  * An atheromatous plaque undergoes **acute plaque change** (erosion, rupture, hemorrhage). * Subendothelial collagen and necrotic plaque contents are exposed, leading to platelet adhesion, aggregation, and activation. * Platelets release thromboxane A2, ADP, and serotonin, causing more aggregation and vasospasm. * Tissue factor activates the coagulation cascade, forming a thrombus. * The thrombus grows to completely occlude the artery lumen within minutes.  **2. Myocardial Response:**  * Within seconds: Cessation of aerobic metabolism, leading to ATP depletion and lactate accumulation. * <2 minutes: Loss of contractility. * 20-40 minutes: **Irreversible myocyte injury (necrosis)** begins in the subendocardium. * 3-6 hours: A **wavefront** of cell death progresses from the subendocardium outward to involve the full thickness of the at-risk myocardium. | - | * <12 hours: Infarct is usually not apparent. Can be highlighted by immersion in **triphenyltetrazolium chloride**, which leaves the infarct as an unstained, pale zone. * 12-24 hours: Reddish-blue discoloration from congested and extravasated blood. * 3-7 days: Infarct is rimmed by a hyperemic zone and has a yellow-tan, soft center. * Weeks to months: Evolves to a gray-white fibrous scar. | * <4 hours: Wavy fibers at border. * 4-12 hours: Early **coagulative necrosis**, edema, hemorrhage. * 12-24 hours: Ongoing coagulative necrosis, pyknosis of nuclei, myocyte hypereosinophilia, marginal contraction band necrosis, early neutrophilic infiltrate. * 1-3 days: Dense neutrophilic infiltrate. * 3-7 days: Disintegration of dead myofibers, phagocytosis by macrophages. * 7-10 days: Well-developed phagocytosis and formation of granulation tissue at margins. * >2 months: Replaced by a dense collagenous scar. * **Reperfusion** alters morphology, causing hemorrhage and **contraction band necrosis** (intense eosinophilic bands). | * Prolonged (>30 min) crushing, stabbing, or squeezing chest pain. * Pain may radiate to the left arm or jaw. * Rapid, weak pulse; profuse sweating (diaphoresis). * Nausea and vomiting (esp. with posterior-inferior MI). * Dyspnea due to impaired contractility and pulmonary edema. * Up to 25% are asymptomatic ("silent MI"), especially in older adults and patients with diabetic neuropathy. | * **Cardiac-specific troponins T and I (cTnT, cTnI)**: Most sensitive and specific biomarkers. Levels rise 2-4 hours after MI, peak at 24-48 hours. * Creatine kinase-MB fraction (CK-MB). * Electrocardiogram (ECG) changes (e.g., ST-segment elevation). | * **Transmural Infarction (STEMI)**: Involves the full ventricular wall thickness; caused by epicardial vessel occlusion. * **Subendocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)**: Necrosis limited to the inner one-third to one-half of the ventricular wall. * **Multifocal Microinfarction**: Pathology of smaller intramural vessels. | * Contractile dysfunction (leading to cardiogenic shock). * Arrhythmias (can cause sudden death). * Myocardial rupture (free wall, septum, or papillary muscle). * Pericarditis (can lead to **Dressler syndrome** weeks later). * Chamber dilation and ventricular remodeling. * Mural thrombus formation and embolization. * Ventricular aneurysm (late complication). * Progressive heart failure (Chronic IHD). | * Oxygen, nitrates, beta-blockers, antiplatelet agents (aspirin), anticoagulants. * **Prompt reperfusion** via thrombolysis, percutaneous coronary intervention (angioplasty/stenting), or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. |
| **Infective Endocarditis (IE)** A microbial infection of the heart valves or the mural endocardium that leads to the formation of vegetations composed of thrombotic debris and organisms, often associated with destruction of the underlying cardiac tissues. | * **Bacteria:**   + *Streptococcus viridans* (50-60% of cases, on previously damaged valves).   + *Staphylococcus aureus* (20-30% of cases, on healthy or damaged valves, major cause in IV drug users).   + Enterococci.   + **HACEK group** (*Haemophilus, Actinobacillus, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, Kingella*). * Fungi and other microorganisms. * About 10% are "culture-negative". | * Underlying cardiac abnormalities: RHD, mitral valve prolapse, degenerative calcific stenosis, bicuspid aortic valve, prosthetic valves. * Intravenous drug abuse (predisposes to right-sided IE). * Source of bacteremia: dental or surgical procedure, contaminated needle, trivial breaks in skin/gut barrier. | 1. Microorganisms are seeded into the bloodstream (**bacteremia** or fungemia). 2. Organisms adhere to and colonize a valve surface, especially if it is already damaged or has a small thrombus. 3. Proliferation of the organisms within a protective mass of thrombotic debris leads to the formation of a **vegetation**. 4. The vegetation can destroy the underlying valve tissue and can embolize to distant sites. | - | * Friable, bulky, and potentially destructive **vegetations** on heart valves (aortic and mitral are most common). * Vegetations can be single or multiple. * Infection can erode into the underlying myocardium to produce a **ring abscess**. | * Vegetations consist of fibrin, inflammatory cells, and large colonies of microorganisms. * Subacute IE may show granulation tissue at the base of the vegetation, indicating chronicity and repair. | * Stormy onset with fever, chills, weakness (acute IE) or insidious onset with nonspecific fatigue, weight loss (subacute IE). * Murmurs are present in the majority. * **Peripheral manifestations** (from emboli or immune complexes):   + Splinter or subungual hemorrhages.   + **Janeway lesions:** Nontender erythematous lesions on palms or soles.   + **Osler nodes:** Tender subcutaneous nodules in the pulp of digits.   + **Roth spots:** Oval retinal hemorrhages with pale centers. * Diagnosis is facilitated by the **Modified Duke Criteria**, which includes major (positive blood culture, echocardiographic evidence) and minor criteria. | * **Blood cultures** for the causative organism (major diagnostic criterion). * Echocardiography to visualize vegetations (major diagnostic criterion). | * **Acute IE:** Caused by highly virulent organisms (e.g., *S. aureus*), often involving a normal valve, with rapid destruction and high mortality. * **Subacute IE:** Caused by organisms of lower virulence (e.g., *S. viridans*), typically seeding a deformed valve, with a protracted course and less destruction. | * Glomerulonephritis due to antigen-antibody complex deposition. * Sepsis. * Arrhythmias from myocardial invasion. * Systemic embolization leading to **septic infarcts** (abscess formation at embolic site) or **mycotic aneurysms**. | * Long-term (6 weeks or more) antibiotic therapy. * Surgical valve replacement may be required, especially with valve destruction, abscess, or persistent infection. * Antibiotic prophylaxis for high-risk patients undergoing certain procedures. |
| **Rheumatic Fever (RF)** An acute, immunologically mediated, multisystem inflammatory disease that occurs a few weeks after group A streptococcal pharyngitis. | Group A streptococcal pharyngitis. | * A preceding (2-3 weeks prior) group A streptococcal infection. * Likely genetic susceptibility, as only ~3% of infected patients develop RF. * More common in children aged 5-15 years. | The pathogenesis is based on **molecular mimicry**.   1. Following a group A streptococcal infection, the host generates an immune response. 2. Antibodies and CD4+ T cells directed against streptococcal M proteins cross-react with host proteins in the heart and other tissues. 3. Antibody binding activates complement, while cytokine production by T cells activates macrophages (within Aschoff bodies), leading to tissue damage. 4. Streptococci are absent from the lesions themselves. | - (Genetic susceptibility is mentioned but no specific genes are listed). | * **Pancarditis** (inflammation of all three heart layers). * Small (1-2 mm), warty vegetations called **verrucae** along the lines of closure of the valve leaflets (especially mitral and aortic). * **MacCallum plaques**: Irregular subendocardial thickenings, usually in the left atrium. | * The pathognomonic lesion is the **Aschoff body**, composed of:   + Foci of T lymphocytes and occasional plasma cells.   + Plump activated macrophages called **Anitschkow cells** ("caterpillar cells"), which have abundant cytoplasm and central nuclei with wavy, ribbon-like chromatin. * Fibrinoid necrosis may be present within valve cusps. | Diagnosis is established using the revised **Jones Criteria** (requiring evidence of a preceding strep infection plus 2 major, or 1 major and 2 minor criteria). **Major Manifestations:**  * Migratory polyarthritis of the large joints. * Pancarditis (myocarditis, pericarditis, endocarditis). * Subcutaneous nodules on extensor surfaces. * Erythema marginatum (circinate skin rash). * Sydenham chorea (neurologic disorder with involuntary movements). | * Evidence of preceding group A strep infection via elevated titers of antibodies like **streptolysin O (ASO)** and **DNase B**. * Elevated acute-phase reactants (e.g., CRP, ESR). | - | * Progression to chronic **Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD)**. * Increased vulnerability to reactivation with subsequent pharyngeal infections. * In rare cases (~1%), death from fulminant myocarditis. | * Antibiotics to eradicate streptococcal infection. * Anti-inflammatory agents (salicylates, steroids) to control inflammation. * Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent recurrence. |
| **Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD)** A chronic condition characterized by deforming fibrotic valvular disease, which is a consequence of acute rheumatic fever. | Sequela of single or repeated attacks of rheumatic fever. | History of acute rheumatic fever. | A result of healing and scarring from acute rheumatic inflammation.  1. Acute inflammation (valvulitis) heals by fibrosis. 2. Subsequent attacks of RF lead to cumulative, irreversible damage and scarring. 3. Turbulence across the deformed valve causes further fibrosis in a "positive feedback loop".  RHD is virtually the only cause of acquired mitral stenosis. | - | * **Mitral valve is virtually always involved.** * Leaflet thickening. * **Commissural fusion** and shortening. * Thickening and fusion of the tendinous cords. * **"Fish mouth"** or **"buttonhole" stenosis** of the mitral valve. * Left atrial dilation, which may harbor mural thrombi. * Right ventricular hypertrophy due to pulmonary hypertension. | * Organization of the acute inflammation with replacement by scar tissue. * Transmural fibrosis that obliterates the normal leaflet architecture. * Neovascularization within the valve leaflet. * Aschoff bodies are rarely seen in chronic RHD. | * Symptoms appear years or decades after the initial RF episode. * Cardiac murmurs. * Cardiac hypertrophy and dilation. * Signs and symptoms of heart failure. | - | - | * Arrhythmias, especially **atrial fibrillation** in the setting of mitral stenosis. * Thromboembolic complications. * Increased risk of developing infective endocarditis on the deformed valves. * Progressive heart failure. | Surgical repair or replacement of the diseased valve(s). |
| **Cardiomyopathy** A heterogeneous group of diseases of the myocardium associated with mechanical and/or electrical dysfunction that usually exhibit inappropriate ventricular hypertrophy or dilatation and are due to a variety of causes that are frequently genetic. | * Genetic. * Infections (e.g., viral myocarditis). * Toxins (e.g., alcohol, cobalt, chemotherapeutic agents like doxorubicin). * Metabolic disorders (e.g., hemochromatosis). * Immunologic (e.g., sarcoidosis). * Peripartum. * Idiopathic. | - (Depends on specific type). | Pathogenesis is highly variable and depends on the specific type. Genetic forms often involve mutations in proteins responsible for contraction, energy generation, or structural integrity of the myocyte. Acquired forms involve direct myocyte injury from toxins, inflammation, or infiltration by abnormal substances. | Mutations in a wide range of genes encoding proteins of the sarcomere, cytoskeleton, nucleus, and mitochondria can cause various cardiomyopathies. | Three main patterns:  1. **Dilated:** Enlarged, heavy, flabby heart with dilation of all chambers. 2. **Hypertrophic:** Thick-walled, heavy, hypercontracting heart, often with asymmetric septal hypertrophy. 3. **Restrictive:** Normal to slightly enlarged ventricles, not dilated, but with firm myocardium and marked bi-atrial dilation. | Varies with the type. Can include myocyte hypertrophy, myocyte disarray, interstitial fibrosis, or infiltration by amyloid, inflammatory cells, etc. | * Symptoms of progressive heart failure (dyspnea, fatigue). * Sudden cardiac death. * Atrial fibrillation. * Stroke from emboli. | - | **Functional/Pathologic Patterns:**  * **Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)** (90% of cases). * **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)**. * **Restrictive Cardiomyopathy (RCM)**. * **Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy**.  **Etiologic Classification:**  * **Primary:** Predominantly confined to the heart (genetic or acquired). * **Secondary:** Myocardial involvement as part of a systemic disorder. | Progressive heart failure-related disability or cardiovascular death. | Treatment is directed at the underlying cause (if known) and managing heart failure. May include medications, implanted devices (pacemakers, defibrillators), ventricular assist devices, or heart transplantation. |
| **Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy (AC/ARVC)** An autosomal dominant disorder that classically manifests with right-sided heart failure and rhythm disturbances, which can cause sudden cardiac death. | Genetic. | Family history. | Mutations in genes encoding desmosomal junctional proteins or interacting proteins at the intercalated disk are thought to lead to myocyte death and subsequent replacement by fat and fibrous tissue, particularly in the right ventricular wall. | Autosomal dominant inheritance. Causal mutations involve genes encoding desmosomal proteins, such as **plakoglobin**, or proteins that interact with the desmosome, like the intermediate filament **desmin**. **Naxos syndrome** is a specific variant also associated with plakoglobin mutations. | * The right ventricular wall is severely attenuated and dilated. * Massive fatty infiltration and focal fibrosis replace the RV myocardium. * Left-sided involvement can also occur. | * Replacement of myocardium by adipose tissue and fibrosis (visible with Masson trichrome stain). * Mononuclear inflammation may be present around degenerating cardiomyocytes. | * Right-sided heart failure. * Rhythm disturbances (arrhythmias). | - | Classical form primarily affects the right ventricle. Left-sided involvement is also recognized. | Sudden cardiac death. | - |
| **Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)** Characterized by progressive cardiac dilation and contractile (systolic) dysfunction, usually with concomitant hypertrophy. It is the most common type of cardiomyopathy. | * **Genetic influences (up to 50% of cases).** * **Myocarditis:** Progression from viral myocarditis (e.g., coxsackie B) is a documented cause. * **Alcohol and other toxins:** Direct toxic effect of ethanol or its metabolites; heavy metals (cobalt); chemotherapeutic drugs (doxorubicin). * **Peripartum cardiomyopathy:** Late in pregnancy or up to 5 months postpartum. * **Iron overload:** Hereditary hemochromatosis or multiple transfusions. * **Supraphysiologic stress:** E.g., persistent tachycardia; excess catecholamines as in **Takotsubo cardiomyopathy** ("broken heart syndrome"). | * Family history. * Alcohol abuse. * Pregnancy. * Thiamine deficiency (can lead to beriberi heart disease, a form of DCM). | The final pathway is ineffective myocardial contraction (systolic dysfunction). The underlying mechanisms are diverse:  * **Genetic:** Mutations in cytoskeletal or other proteins impair force generation or transmission. * **Toxic/Inflammatory:** Direct myocyte injury leads to death and subsequent remodeling. * **Takotsubo:** Catecholamine surge causes myocyte stunning or necrosis, often with "apical ballooning". | * Inheritance is most often **autosomal dominant**. * Truncating mutations in the gene for **TTN (titin)**, a large sarcomeric protein, account for 10-20% of all cases. * Mutations in >20 other genes encoding proteins of the cytoskeleton (e.g., dystrophin), sarcolemma, and nuclear envelope (e.g., lamin A/C). * X-linked and mitochondrial inheritance patterns are less common. | * Heart is enlarged, heavy (2-3 times normal), and flabby. * Dilation of all four chambers is characteristic. * **Mural thrombi** are common, especially at the apex, and can be a source of emboli. * No primary valvular alterations are present. | * Histologic abnormalities are generally nonspecific. * Most muscle cells are hypertrophied with enlarged nuclei; some are attenuated and stretched. * Interstitial and endocardial fibrosis of variable degree. * In cases caused by titin-truncating mutations, myocytes may exhibit highly distorted, hyperchromatic **"Ninja star"-like nuclei**. | * Presents most commonly between ages 20 and 50. * Slowly progressive signs of congestive heart failure: dyspnea, easy fatigability, poor exertional capacity. * Cardiac ejection fraction is severely reduced (typically <25%). | - | - | * Secondary mitral regurgitation due to chamber dilation. * Abnormal cardiac rhythms (arrhythmias). * Thromboembolism from intracardiac thrombi. * Death results from progressive cardiac failure or arrhythmia. | * Pharmacologic therapies for heart failure. * Cardiac resynchronization (biventricular pacing). * Ventricular assist devices (VADs). * Cardiac transplantation for end-stage disease. |
| **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)** A common (1 in 500) genetic disorder characterized by myocardial hypertrophy, poorly compliant left ventricular myocardium leading to abnormal diastolic filling, and (in about one-third of cases) intermittent ventricular outflow obstruction. | Genetic. Virtually all cases are caused by mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins. | Family history. | Arises from mutations in sarcomeric proteins, leading to a "hypercontracting" heart. The precise mechanism is unclear but may involve defective energy transfer from mitochondria to the sarcomere. The result is massive myocyte hypertrophy, which stiffens the ventricular wall and causes diastolic dysfunction (impaired filling). In some, the hypertrophied septum obstructs the left ventricular outflow tract during systole. | * Inheritance is **autosomal dominant** with variable penetrance. * Caused by missense mutations in one of several genes that encode **sarcomeric proteins**. * Most common mutations are in the gene for **β-myosin heavy chain (MYH7)** or **myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3)**. * Other involved genes include those for cardiac troponin T (TnT), troponin I (TnI), and α-tropomyosin. | * Massive myocardial hypertrophy, usually without ventricular dilation. * The classic pattern is **asymmetric septal hypertrophy**, where the ventricular septum is disproportionately thickened relative to the free wall. * The left ventricular cavity may be compressed into a "banana-like" shape. * A fibrous endocardial plaque is often seen in the LV outflow tract due to contact with the anterior mitral leaflet. | 1. **Massive myocyte hypertrophy** (transverse diameter >40 μm). 2. **Myofiber disarray:** Haphazard, disorganized arrangement of myocyte bundles and individual cells. 3. Interstitial and replacement fibrosis. 4. Thickening and fibrotic narrowing of small intramural arteries. | * Reduced stroke volume due to impaired diastolic filling. * Exertional dyspnea is a common symptom. * Harsh systolic ejection murmur (due to ventricular outflow obstruction). * Focal myocardial ischemia and angina, even without epicardial coronary artery disease. | - | - | * Atrial fibrillation. * Mural thrombus formation leading to embolization and stroke. * Intractable cardiac failure. * Ventricular arrhythmias. * **Sudden cardiac death**, which is one of the most common causes of otherwise unexplained death in young athletes. | * Pharmacologic intervention (e.g., β-adrenergic blockade) to decrease heart rate and contractility. * Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) for patients at risk of arrhythmias. * Surgical excision of muscle (septal myectomy) or catheter-based septal infarction (alcohol ablation) to relieve outflow tract obstruction. |
| **Heart Failure (HF)** Also called Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). A condition in which the heart cannot pump blood adequately to meet the metabolic demands of peripheral tissues, or can do so only at elevated filling pressures. | * **Left-sided HF:** Ischemic heart disease (IHD), systemic hypertension, aortic and mitral valvular diseases, primary myocardial diseases. * **Right-sided HF:** Most common cause is left-sided HF. Less commonly, primary pulmonary disorders (**cor pulmonale**) such as parenchymal lung disease (e.g., emphysema), or disorders of pulmonary vasculature (e.g., primary pulmonary hypertension). | Any condition listed under Etiology. | HF is preceded by compensatory mechanisms that eventually become maladaptive:   1. **Frank-Starling mechanism:** Increased filling volumes dilate the heart to enhance contractility. 2. **Myocardial adaptations:** Myocytes increase in size (hypertrophy) to handle increased mechanical work, leading to ventricular remodeling. 3. **Activation of neurohumoral systems:**    * Release of norepinephrine increases heart rate and contractility.    * Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system promotes salt/water retention to augment circulatory volume.   Ultimately, these mechanisms fail, leading to **systolic dysfunction** (impaired contractility/ejection) or **diastolic dysfunction** (impaired filling/relaxation). | - (Genes related to underlying causes, e.g., cardiomyopathies, may be involved). | * **Heart:** Ventricular hypertrophy and/or dilation. In left HF, the left atrium is often dilated. * **Lungs (in Left HF):** Heavy and wet due to pulmonary congestion and edema. * **Liver and Portal System (in Right HF):** Congestive hepatomegaly, leading to a **"nutmeg liver"** appearance. Congestive splenomegaly. * **Body Cavities:** Pleural effusions, pericardial effusions, ascites. * **Subcutaneous Tissues:** Peripheral edema (especially pedal/pretibial). Generalized massive edema (anasarca). | * **Heart:** Myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis are nonspecific findings. * **Lungs (in Left HF):** Perivascular and interstitial edema, accumulation of edema fluid in alveolar spaces, and extravasated red cells. The latter are phagocytosed by macrophages, which become laden with hemosiderin (**heart failure cells**). * **Liver (in Right HF):** Congestion around central veins (centrilobular congestion). With severe hypoxia, can see centrilobular necrosis. Long-standing failure can lead to **cardiac cirrhosis**. | * **Left-Sided HF (Pulmonary symptoms):** Dyspnea on exertion, cough, **orthopnea** (dyspnea when supine), **paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea** (PND). Fine rales at lung bases. Tachycardia, S3 or S4 heart sounds. * **Right-Sided HF (Systemic venous congestion):** Peripheral edema (e.g., pedal edema), jugular venous distention, congestive hepatomegaly, ascites. | * Serum levels of **B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)** are elevated due to ventricular wall stress. * Echocardiography is used to measure ejection fraction, assess valvular function, and visualize wall motion. | * **Left-Sided vs. Right-Sided Heart Failure** * **Systolic vs. Diastolic Failure:**   + **Systolic:** Insufficient ejection fraction (pump failure).   + **Diastolic:** Abnormally stiff ventricle that cannot relax and fill properly. | * Atrial fibrillation due to atrial dilation. * Secondary renal insufficiency (prerenal azotemia) due to hypoperfusion. * Hypoxic encephalopathy in far-advanced cases. * Progressive failure culminating in global heart failure. | * Address the underlying cause. * Pharmacologic agents: diuretics, ACE inhibitors, adrenergic blockers. * Salt restriction. * Advanced therapies: cardiac resynchronization therapy (pacing), mechanical ventricular assist devices (VADs), cardiac transplantation. |
| **Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)** One of the most common cyanotic congenital heart diseases, comprising four cardinal features that result from a single developmental defect. | Results embryologically from anterosuperior displacement of the infundibular septum. | Can be a feature of broader genetic syndromes such as DiGeorge syndrome or Alagille syndrome. | The single defect (anterosuperior displacement of the infundibular septum) directly causes three of the four features:  1. **Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD):** The septum is malaligned. 2. **Obstruction of RV Outflow Tract (subpulmonic stenosis):** The displaced septum narrows the outflow tract. 3. **Overriding Aorta:** The aorta arises from above the VSD, receiving blood from both ventricles.  The fourth feature, **Right Ventricular Hypertrophy**, is an adaptive consequence of the RV pumping against the outflow obstruction. The combination of VSD and RV outflow obstruction leads to a right-to-left shunt of deoxygenated blood into the systemic circulation, causing cyanosis. | * Can be associated with deletion of chromosome **22q11.2 (DiGeorge syndrome)**, which affects the **TBX1** gene. * Can be associated with mutations in **JAG1** or **NOTCH2** (Alagille syndrome). * Nonsyndromic cases can have mutations in **ZFPM2** or **NKX2.5**. | * The heart is typically enlarged and classically **"boot-shaped"** on radiographs due to marked right ventricular hypertrophy. * The VSD is usually large. * The aorta overrides the VSD. * The RV outflow tract is narrowed (subpulmonic stenosis). * The pulmonary arteries may be hypoplastic. | - | * Most infants are cyanotic at birth or soon thereafter (**"classic TOF"**). The degree of cyanosis depends on the severity of the subpulmonic stenosis. * If stenosis is mild, the shunt may be left-to-right, without cyanosis (**"pink tetralogy"**), resembling an isolated VSD. * As the child grows, the stenosis can become progressively worse. | Diagnosis is made by echocardiography. | - | * Severe, long-standing cyanosis leads to polycythemia and clubbing of digits. * Increased risk of infective endocarditis. * Risk of **paradoxical embolism** (venous emboli bypass the lungs and enter systemic circulation). | Complete surgical repair. |
| **Vegetations of the Heart** A mass, typically on a heart valve, composed of varying amounts of thrombotic debris, organisms, and/or inflammatory cells. They are not a disease themselves but a key feature of several valvular pathologies. | Varies by underlying disease:  * **IE:** Microbial infection. * **RHD:** Immune-mediated inflammation. * **NBTE:** Hypercoagulable states. * **Libman-Sacks:** Autoimmune disease (SLE). | Valve damage, bacteremia, malignancy, autoimmune disease. | Varies by underlying disease. Generally involves endocardial injury followed by deposition of platelets and fibrin, which can then be colonized by bacteria (in IE) or grow due to hypercoagulability (in NBTE). | - | Appearance and size vary significantly with the type (see Classification column). | * **IE:** Fibrin, inflammatory cells, and colonies of microorganisms. * **RHD:** Fibrinoid necrosis with minimal inflammation. * **NBTE:** Bland thrombus (fibrin and platelets) with no inflammation or organisms. * **Libman-Sacks:** Fibrinoid necrosis and inflammation (valvulitis). | * May cause a new or changed heart murmur. * Fever and constitutional symptoms if infective. * Signs of systemic embolization (e.g., stroke, infarcts in other organs). | Echocardiography is the primary method of detection. | **Four Major Forms of Vegetative Endocarditis:**  * **Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD):** Small (1-2mm), warty vegetations (**verrucae**) along the lines of closure. * **Infective Endocarditis (IE):** Large, irregular, friable, destructive masses that can extend to chordae. * **Nonbacterial Thrombotic Endocarditis (NBTE):** Small (1-5mm), bland, non-destructive, single or multiple vegetations, usually at the line of closure. * **Libman-Sacks Endocarditis (SLE):** Small or medium-sized sterile vegetations on either or both sides of the valve leaflets, chordae, or endocardium. | * Systemic embolization, leading to infarction. * If infective, emboli can be septic, causing distant abscesses or mycotic aneurysms. * Progressive valve damage (stenosis or regurgitation). | Treatment is directed at the underlying disease (e.g., antibiotics for IE, immunosuppression for SLE, anticoagulation for NBTE). |
