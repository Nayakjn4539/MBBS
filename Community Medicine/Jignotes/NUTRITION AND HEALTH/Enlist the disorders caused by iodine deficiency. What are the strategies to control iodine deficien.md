### Disorders Caused by Iodine Deficiency: The Spectrum of IDD

Iodine deficiency affects all stages of life, from intrauterine growth to adulthood. The term [[Iodine Deficiency Disorders]] (IDD) refers to the wide spectrum of effects of iodine deficiency on growth and development.

**Spectrum of IDD by Age Group:**

| Age Group | Health Problems / Disorders |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fetus** | • [[Abortions]] and Stillbirths <br>• Congenital anomalies <br>• Increased perinatal mortality <br>• **Endemic Cretinism:** <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; a) **Neurological Cretinism:** Mental deficiency, deaf-mutism, spastic diplegia, squint. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; b) **Myxedematous Cretinism:** Dwarfism, mental deficiency, hypothyroidism. |
| **Neonate** | • [[Neonatal goitre]] <br>• [[Neonatal hypothyroidism]] |
| **Child & Adolescent** | • **Goitre** (Enlargement of thyroid gland) <br>• Juvenile hypothyroidism <br>• Impaired mental function and subnormal intelligence (Loss of 10-15 IQ points) <br>• Retarded physical development |
| **Adult** | • Goitre and its complications <br>• Hypothyroidism <br>• Impaired mental function <br>• Reduced productivity |

> **Clinical Relevance:** [[Neonatal hypothyroidism]] is the most significant preventable cause of mental retardation. Screening TSH levels in cord blood is crucial for early detection.

### Strategies to Control Iodine Deficiency in India

The Government of India launched the **National Goitre Control Programme (NGCP)** in 1962, which was renamed the [[National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Programme]] (NIDDCP) in 1992 to reflect the wider spectrum of the problem.

The control strategies are implemented through the following core components:

#### 1. Universal Salt Iodization (USI)
This is the primary strategy. The policy is to fortify all edible salt with iodine.
*   **Compound Used:** Potassium Iodate ($KIO_3$) is used because it is more stable in the hot and humid climate of India compared to potassium iodide.
*   **Standards of Iodization:** Under the Prevention of Food Adulteration (PFA) Act:
    *   **At Production Level:** Not less than **30 ppm** (parts per million).
    *   **At Consumer Level:** Not less than **15 ppm**.
*   **Ban:** Sale of non-iodized salt for human consumption is banned in India.

#### 2. Iodine Monitoring and Surveillance
Regular surveys are conducted to assess the magnitude of IDD and the impact of control measures.
*   **District IDD Survey:** Conducted every 5 years.
*   **Indicators for Monitoring:**
    *   **[[Urinary Iodine Excretion]] (UIE):** This is the **principal impact indicator** for current iodine intake.
    *   **Goitre Prevalence:** Assessed in school children (6–12 years).
    *   **Salt Testing:** Testing iodine content at household and retail levels using spot testing kits.

#### 3. Alternative Strategies (For Special Situations)
*   **Iodized Oil:** Used in severe endemic areas where salt distribution is difficult.
    *   *Intramuscular injection (1 ml):* Provides protection for **4 years**.
    *   *Oral dose:* Effective for about 2 years.
*   **Double Fortified Salt (DFS):** Salt fortified with both **Iron and Iodine** to combat anemia and IDD simultaneously. Developed by the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad.

#### 4. Manpower Training and Health Education (IEC)
*   Training of medical and paramedical personnel in diagnosis and survey techniques.
*   Mass communication to promote the consumption of iodized salt using the **"Smiling Sun"** logo to identify genuine iodized salt packets.

**Mnemonic for IDD Spectrum:** **"ABCD"**
*   **A** - Abortions/Anomalies
*   **B** - Brain damage (Mental retardation)
*   **C** - Cretinism
*   **D** - Deaf-mutism / Dwarfism
