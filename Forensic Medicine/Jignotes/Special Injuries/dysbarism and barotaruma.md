# [[Special Injuries]] > dysbarism and barotaruma

### Dysbarism and Barotrauma

**Dysbarism** refers to a group of medical conditions resulting from changes in ambient environmental pressure (either high or low). **Barotrauma** specifically refers to physical tissue damage caused by a pressure difference between an unvented space inside the body and the surrounding gas or fluid.

These conditions are commonly associated with underwater diving, aviation, and explosions.

### I. Decompression Sickness (Caisson Disease)
Also known as "The Bends" or "Diver's Palsy". It occurs when an individual exposed to high pressure (e.g., deep-sea divers, tunnel workers/caisson workers) undergoes rapid decompression (rapid ascent).

#### Pathophysiology
*   Based on **Henry's Law**: The amount of gas dissolved in a liquid is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above it.
*   Under high pressure (deep water), inert gases (mainly **Nitrogen**) dissolve in blood and tissues.
*   During rapid ascent, pressure drops, and nitrogen comes out of the solution faster than the lungs can expire it, forming gas bubbles in the blood and tissues.
*   These bubbles cause mechanical obstruction (embolism), tissue compression, and inflammatory reactions.

#### Clinical Manifestations
| Type | Name | Clinical Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type I (Mild)** | **"The Bends"** | Severe, throbbing joint pain (knees, shoulders, elbows). Skin mottling (**Cutis marmorata**) and pruritus (diver's itch). |
| **Type II (Severe)** | **"The Staggers"** | **CNS Involvement:** Vertigo, ataxia, paralysis, unconsciousness. Spinal cord hits are common. |
| | **"The Chokes"** | **Respiratory:** Substernal distress, cough, dyspnea (pulmonary emboli). |
| **Chronic** | **Dysbaric Osteonecrosis** | Aseptic necrosis of bone (distal femur, proximal tibia, humerus) due to nitrogen bubbles in fatty marrow. |

**Mnemonic for DCS Types:**
*   **B**ends (Bones/Joints - Type I)
*   **C**hokes (Chest/Lungs - Type II)
*   **S**taggers (Spinal/CNS - Type II)

#### Autopsy Findings in Decompression Sickness
1.  **General:** [[Rigor Mortis]] appears early.
2.  **Skin:** Subcutaneous emphysema and patches of lividity.
3.  **Vessels:** Bubbles of gas (nitrogen) found in veins, right side of the heart, and arteries.
4.  **Lungs:** Congested, edematous, and may show haemorrhages.
5.  **Brain/Spinal Cord:** Ischaemic necrosis, softening, and gas bubbles in superficial vessels.
6.  **Diagnosis Confirmation:** Opening the heart under water (to detect [[Air Embolism]]).

### II. Barotrauma (Pressure Injury)
Damage to air-containing body cavities (Ears, Sinuses, Lungs, GIT) due to expansion or compression of gas during pressure changes.

#### 1. Pulmonary Barotrauma (Burst Lung)
*   **Mechanism:** Occurs during rapid ascent if a diver holds their breath. The expanding air ruptures alveoli.
*   **Consequences:**
    *   **Pneumothorax:** Air in the pleural cavity.
    *   **Mediastinal Emphysema:** Air in the mediastinum.
    *   **Arterial Gas Embolism (AGE):** Air enters pulmonary veins $\rightarrow$ Left Heart $\rightarrow$ Systemic circulation (Brain/Coronaries). This is a major cause of death.

#### 2. Blast Injuries (Explosive Barotrauma)
Explosions generate a high-pressure blast wave causing specific injury patterns.

> Classification of Blast Injuries showing Primary, Secondary, Tertiary and Quaternary effects

**Classification of Blast Injuries:**

| Category | Mechanism | Injuries |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary** | **Blast Wave** (High pressure) | **Barotrauma:** Ruptured tympanic membrane (Eardrum), **Blast Lung** (hemorrhage/edema), Bowel perforation. |
| **Secondary** | **Flying Debris** (Shrapnel) | Penetrating injuries, lacerations, [[Bruise]]. |
| **Tertiary** | **Wind/Displacement** | Body thrown against objects $\rightarrow$ [[Fractures]], blunt trauma. |
| **Quaternary** | **Heat/Gas** | [[Burns]], asphyxia, toxic gas inhalation. |

*   **Primary Blast Injury:** Only affects gas-containing organs. The **Ear** is the most common organ injured; the **Lung** is the most common cause of death (critical organ).
*   **Blast Lung:** Alveolar rupture, hemorrhage, and edema. "Rib markings" may be seen on lungs.
*   **Marshall's Triad:** Seen in blast injuries:
    1.  Punctured eardrums.
    2.  Pulmonary hemorrhage (Blast lung).
    3.  Bruising/Burns.

### III. Air Embolism (Caisson Disease)
While often a result of barotrauma or DCS, it can also be iatrogenic or traumatic.

*   **Venous Air Embolism:** Air enters systemic veins $\rightarrow$ Right Heart $\rightarrow$ Pulmonary Artery ("Air Lock") $\rightarrow$ Pulmonary hypertension/failure.
    *   *Causes:* CVC insertion, cut throat injuries (jugular vein), criminal abortion (syringing).
    *   *Fatal Volume:* ~100 ml of air is generally required to be fatal, though smaller amounts can kill if the rate of entry is rapid.
*   **Arterial Air Embolism:** Air enters pulmonary veins $\rightarrow$ Left Heart $\rightarrow$ Coronary/Cerebral arteries.
    *   *Causes:* Pulmonary barotrauma, cardiac surgery.
    *   *Fatal Volume:* Very small amounts (0.5–2 ml) can be fatal if they block coronary or cerebral vessels.

**Autopsy Diagnosis of Air Embolism:**
1.  **Pre-autopsy X-ray:** To visualize gas in the heart/vessels.
2.  **Dissection Technique:**
    *   Handle body carefully to avoid creating artificial bubbles.
    *   Make a window in the pericardium.
    *   Fill the pericardial sac with water.
    *   Puncture the right ventricle under water.
    *   **Positive Finding:** Air bubbles escaping through the water.
    *   *Note:* In decomposition, gas generated by putrefaction can mimic air embolism (false positive).

### Medicolegal Aspects
1.  **Accidental:** Most common (SCUBA diving, aviation accidents, tunnel/bridge construction).
2.  **Occupational Hazard:** Recognized in workers in compressed air environments (Caisson workers).
3.  **Terrorism/Warfare:** Blast injuries and barotrauma are key forensic findings in bomb explosion victims to determine proximity to the device.
4.  **Iatrogenic:** Air embolism during surgeries, IV infusions, or hemodialysis.
5.  **Criminal Abortion:** Air embolism due to syringing fluids into the uterus.
