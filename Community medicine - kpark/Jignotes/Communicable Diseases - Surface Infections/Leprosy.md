# Leprosy (Hansen's Disease)

Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by [[Mycobacterium leprae]]. It principally affects the **peripheral nerves** and skin, but also affects mucosa of the upper respiratory tract and eyes. It is often referred to as a "Social Disease" due to the stigma attached to it.

### Epidemiological Determinants

**1. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** [[Mycobacterium leprae]] (acid-fast bacillus).
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Occurs in clumps called [[globi]].
    *   Has an affinity for **Schwann cells** and the Reticulo-endothelial system.
    *   **Cannot** be grown in artificial media. Can be grown in 9-banded armadillo and mouse footpads.
*   **Generation Time:** Exceptionally long, **12–14 days**.
*   **Viability:** Can survive in dried nasal secretions for 9 days and moist soil for 46 days.
*   **Nature:** High **Infectivity**, Low **Pathogenicity**.

**2. Host Factors**
*   **Reservoir:** Humans are the only known reservoir (multibacillary cases are the most important source).
*   **Age:** All ages; incidence peaks between 20–30 years.
*   **Sex:** Males > Females (2:1).
*   **Immunity:** [[Cell-Mediated Immunity]] (CMI) is crucial.
    *   **Strong CMI:** Localized disease (Tuberculoid).
    *   **Absent CMI:** Generalized disease (Lepromatous).

**3. Environmental Factors**
*   Overcrowding and lack of ventilation favor transmission.
*   Humidity favors survival of the bacillus.

### Transmission
*   **Portal of Exit:** **Nose** (major portal), ulcerated skin.
*   **Portal of Entry:** Respiratory tract (droplet infection) and skin.
*   **Modes of Transmission:**
    *   **Droplet Infection:** Aerosols from sneezing/coughing of untreated lepromatous patients.
    *   **Contact:** Direct skin-to-skin contact or indirect contact via fomites/soil.
    *   **Other:** Breast milk, transplacental, tattoo needles (rare).

**Incubation Period:**
*   Long and variable. Average **3 to 5 years**. Can be as long as 20 years.

### Classification

There are multiple classifications, but the **Operational Classification** is used for treatment purposes under the [[National Leprosy Eradication Programme]] (NLEP).

| Parameter | **Paucibacillary (PB)** | **Multibacillary (MB)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Skin Lesions** | 1 – 5 lesions | 6 or more lesions |
| **Nerve Involvement** | Only 1 nerve involved | More than 1 nerve involved |
| **Skin Smear** | Negative at all sites | Positive at any site |
| **Indian Classification Types** | Indeterminate, Tuberculoid, Borderline Tuberculoid | Borderline, Borderline Lepromatous, Lepromatous |

*Source:*

**Ridley-Jopling Classification (Immuno-histological scale):**
*   **TT:** Tuberculoid (High Immunity)
*   **BT:** Borderline Tuberculoid
*   **BB:** Mid-Borderline (Unstable)
*   **BL:** Borderline Lepromatous
*   **LL:** Lepromatous (Low/Absent Immunity)
*(Note: Pure Neuritic type is part of Indian classification but NOT Ridley-Jopling)*.

### Clinical Features

**Cardinal Signs of Leprosy** (At least one must be present for diagnosis):
1.  **Hypopigmented or reddish skin lesion(s)** with definite **loss of sensation** (temperature lost first, then light touch, then pain).
2.  **Thickening of peripheral nerves** with loss of sensation and weakness of supplied muscles.
3.  **Demonstration of [[M. leprae]]** in skin slit smears.

**Common Deformities:**
*   **Face:** Facies Leonina (Lion face), loss of eyebrows (madarosis), sagging face, depressed nose.
*   **Hands:** Claw hand (Ulnar nerve), Ape hand (Median nerve), Wrist drop (Radial nerve).
*   **Feet:** Foot drop (Lateral popliteal nerve), Plantar ulcers, Claw toes.

**Clinical Relevance (Nerve Palpation):**
*   **Ulnar Nerve:** Palpated at the elbow (medial epicondyle).
*   **Great Auricular Nerve:** Palpated across the sternocleidomastoid muscle (turn head to opposite side).
*   **Common Peroneal:** Popliteal fossa (head of fibula).

### Diagnosis

1.  **Clinical:** Identification of cardinal signs.
2.  **Bacteriological:** **Slit Skin Smear**.
    *   Calculates the **Bacteriological Index (BI)**: Density of bacilli (living + dead).
    *   Calculates the **Morphological Index (MI)**: Percentage of living (solid staining) bacilli. MI is the *most sensitive* index to assess treatment efficacy.
3.  **Immunological (Prognostic):** [[Lepromin Test]].
    *   **Not a diagnostic test**.
    *   Used to classify type of leprosy and assess CMI.
    *   **Fernandez Reaction:** Early (48 hrs) – indicates delayed hypersensitivity.
    *   **Mitsuda Reaction:** Late (21 days) – indicates CMI status (Positive in Tuberculoid, Negative in Lepromatous).

### Treatment: [[Multi-Drug Therapy]] (MDT)

The goal is to render the patient non-infectious. An infectious patient becomes non-infectious within **90 days** of Dapsone or **3 weeks** of Rifampicin.

**Standard NLEP Regimen:**

| **Type** | **Drug** | **Adult Dose** | **Frequency** | **Duration** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Paucibacillary (PB)** | Rifampicin | 600 mg | Once Monthly (Supervised) | **6 Months** (Finish in 9 months) |
| | Dapsone | 100 mg | Daily (Self-administered) | |
| **Multibacillary (MB)** | Rifampicin | 600 mg | Once Monthly (Supervised) | **12 Months** (Finish in 18 months) |
| | Clofazimine | 300 mg | Once Monthly (Supervised) | |
| | Clofazimine | 50 mg | Daily (Self-administered) | |
| | Dapsone | 100 mg | Daily (Self-administered) | |

*Source:*

**Treatment of Single Skin Lesion:**
Currently treated as Paucibacillary Leprosy (6 months regimen).

**Mnemonic for Side Effects:**
*   **R**ifampicin: **R**ed urine / **R**espiratory syndrome / **R**ising enzymes (hepatotoxicity).
*   **D**apsone: **D**ecreased Hb (Hemolysis in G6PD), **D**ermatitis (exfoliative).
*   **C**lofazimine: **C**oloration of skin (Red/Black), **C**orneal deposits.

### Lepra Reactions

Acute inflammatory episodes during the chronic course of the disease.

| Feature | **Type 1 Reaction (Reversal)** | **Type 2 Reaction (ENL)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mechanism** | Delayed Hypersensitivity (CMI recovery) | Antigen-Antibody Complex (Humoral) |
| **Type of Leprosy** | Borderline types (BT, BB, BL) | Multibacillary (BL, LL) |
| **Skin Lesions** | Existing lesions become red, swollen, tender | New tender, red nodules (Evanescent) |
| **Nerves** | Painful neuritis, sudden loss of function | Less severe nerve involvement |
| **Systemic signs** | Usually absent | Fever, joint pain, kidney/eye involvement |
| **Drug of Choice** | **Prednisolone** | **Prednisolone** (Mild: Aspirin; Severe: Steroids) |
| **Other Drugs** | - | Thalidomide, Clofazimine |

*Note: MDT should **NOT** be stopped during reactions.*

### Prevention and Control

1.  **Early Case Detection:** Active search by ASHA/Health workers.
2.  **MDT:** Breaks the chain of transmission rapidly.
3.  **[[Chemoprophylaxis]]:** Single dose **Rifampicin** for contacts.
4.  **Immunoprophylaxis:** [[BCG Vaccine]] provides variable protection (20-80%) against leprosy.
5.  **Rehabilitation:** Prevention of disabilities (care of anesthetic hands/feet), reconstructive surgery.

**National Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP):**
*   **Goal:** Elimination of leprosy as a public health problem.
*   **Elimination Definition:** Prevalence Rate **< 1 case per 10,000 population**.
*   **Current Strategy:** Global Leprosy Strategy 2016-2020 "Accelerating towards a leprosy-free world".
    *   Zero disease.
    *   Zero transmission.
    *   Zero disability.
    *   Zero stigma.
