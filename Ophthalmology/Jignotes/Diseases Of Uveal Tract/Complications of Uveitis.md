# [[Diseases Of Uveal Tract]] > Complications of Uveitis

### Complications of Uveitis

Inflammation of the uveal tract ([[Uveitis]]) rarely remains confined to the uvea. Due to the anatomical proximity and shared vascular/fluid dynamics, it frequently involves adjacent structures like the cornea, retina, vitreous, and optic nerve. These complications are often the primary cause of visual impairment and blindness.

The complications can be broadly classified based on the anatomical location or the pathophysiological mechanism.

### 1. Anterior Segment Complications

#### A. Corneal Complications
*   **[[Band shaped keratopathy]] (BSK):**
    *   This is a degenerative change characterized by the deposition of calcium salts (hydroxyapatite) in the [[Bowman's membrane]] and superficial stroma,,.
    *   **Appearance:** A whitish band across the cornea in the interpalpebral zone with a "Swiss cheese" appearance (clear holes representing corneal nerve penetrating sites) and a clear zone between the opacity and the limbus [[lucid interval of Vogt]].
    *   **Association:** Classically seen in chronic uveitis associated with [[Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis]] (JIA/Still’s disease) in children and chronic iridocyclitis,,.
    *   **Treatment:** Chelation with [[EDTA]] (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid),.
*   **[[Corneal edema]] & [[Bullous keratopathy]]:**
    *   Caused by toxic [[endotheliitis]] (damage to endothelial cells by inflammatory toxins) or secondary raised intraocular pressure,.
    *   Chronic edema can lead to the formation of epithelial bullae (bullous keratopathy),.
*   **[[Keratic Precipitates]] (KPs):**
    *   Old KPs may persist as pigmented or hyalinized ("ground glass") deposits on the posterior cornea.
*   **[[Sclerosing keratouveitis]]:**
    *   Inflammation extending from the sclera to the cornea, leading to corneal opacification,.

#### B. Iris and Pupillary Complications
*   **[[Posterior Synechiae]]:** Adhesions between the posterior surface of the iris and the anterior capsule of the lens,.
    *   **Segmental:** Leads to an irregular pupil (festooned pupil upon dilation),.
    *   **[[Annular Synechiae]] (Ring Synechiae):** 360-degree adhesion leads to **[[Seclusio Pupillae]]** (obstruction of aqueous flow from posterior to anterior chamber),.
*   **[[Iris Bombe]]:**
    *   Consequence of seclusio pupillae. Aqueous accumulates in the posterior chamber, pushing the peripheral iris forward, which can close the filtration angle,,.
*   **[[Occlusio Pupillae]]:**
    *   A fibrous membrane (organized exudates) completely covers the pupillary area, blocking vision,,.
*   **[[Iris Atrophy]]:**
    *   Diffuse or sectoral atrophy of the iris stroma. Typical in herpetic uveitis and [[Fuch's heterochromic iridocyclitis]],.
*   **[[Rubeosis Iridis]]:**
    *   Neovascularization of the iris (NVI) develops in chronic iridocyclitis or Fuchs' uveitis syndrome due to ischemia,.

#### C. Secondary Glaucoma
Glaucoma is a frequent and serious complication, occurring via two main mechanisms,,:

| Type of Glaucoma | Mechanism | Clinical Features | Treatment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Early / Inflammatory Glaucoma** (Hypertensive Uveitis) | • Clogging of [[trabecular meshwork]] by inflammatory cells/fibrin.<br>• [[Trabeculitis]] (inflammation of meshwork).<br>• Increased viscosity of aqueous (plasmoid aqueous).<br>• Prostaglandin release. | Deep anterior chamber, open angle, raised IOP during active inflammation. | • Suppress inflammation (Steroids).<br>• Aqueous suppressants (Timolol, Acetazolamide).<br>• **Avoid** [[Pilocarpine]] (increases inflammation) & [[Prostaglandin analogues]] (cause CME),. |
| **Late / Post-inflammatory Glaucoma** | • **Pupil Block:** Seclusio pupillae $\rightarrow$ Iris Bombe $\rightarrow$ Angle Closure.<br>• **Angle Closure:** Peripheral Anterior Synechiae (PAS) organizing in the angle.<br>• **Neovascular Glaucoma:** NVI zipping up the angle. | Shallow anterior chamber (in pupil block), synechial angle closure on gonioscopy. | • [[Laser Iridotomy]] (for pupil block).<br>• Filtration surgery ([[Trabeculectomy]]) or Valve implants for PAS/chronic cases,. |

### 2. Lens Complications (Complicated Cataract)

*   **Incidence:** Very common complication of chronic anterior uveitis (especially Fuch’s and JIA) and posterior uveitis,.
*   **Pathogenesis:** Disturbance of lens nutrition due to inflammatory toxins in the aqueous and vitreous.
*   **Morphology:**
    *   typically starts as a **[[Posterior Subcapsular Cataract]] (PSC)**,,.
    *   **[[Polychromatic Lustre]]:** A pathognomonic sign giving a rainbow-like play of colors,.
    *   **"Breadcrumb" Appearance:** Opacities look like breadcrumbs in the slit lamp beam,,.
    *   Eventually, the entire lens becomes opaque (Total Cataract).
*   **Management:** Cataract surgery is performed only when the eye has been quiet (inflammation controlled) for at least 3 months.

> **Mnemonic for causes of Complicated Cataract:** **UMAR**,
> *   **U**veitis
> *   **M**yopia (High)
> *   **A**ngle closure glaucoma
> *   **R**etinitis Pigmentosa

### 3. Posterior Segment Complications

*   **[[Cystoid Macular Edema]] (CME):**
    *   The most common cause of permanent visual loss in uveitis,,,.
    *   **Pathogenesis:** Inflammatory mediators (prostaglandins) break down the blood-retinal barrier, leading to fluid accumulation in the outer plexiform layer,.
    *   **Diagnosis:** [[OCT]] shows cystic spaces; [[FFA]] shows a "flower petal" pattern,.
*   **[[Vitreous Opacities]]:**
    *   Inflammatory cells, exudates ("snowballs"), and debris accumulate in the vitreous, causing floaters and haze,.
*   **[[Retinal Detachment]] (RD):**
    *   **Exudative RD:** Due to fluid accumulation under the retina in severe posterior uveitis (e.g., VKH syndrome, sympathetic ophthalmitis),.
    *   **Tractional RD:** Due to organization of vitreous bands (cyclitic membranes) pulling on the retina,.
*   **[[Cyclitic Membrane]]:**
    *   Fibrovascular organization of exudates behind the lens (in the anterior vitreous/retrolental space),.
    *   Can lead to ciliary body detachment and hypotension.
*   **Others:**
    *   **[[Papillitis]]:** Inflammation of the optic disc.
    *   **[[Macular Hole]] / [[Epiretinal Membrane]]**.
    *   **Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV):** Secondary to choroidal inflammation.

### 4. Global / End-Stage Complications

When uveitis is severe, chronic, or untreated, it leads to the disorganization of the entire globe.

*   **[[Hypotony]] (Ocular Hypotension):**
    *   Caused by ciliary body atrophy or traction by a cyclitic membrane leading to ciliary body detachment ("ciliary shutdown").
*   **[[Phthisis Bulbi]]:**
    *   The end-stage of severe uveitis. The eye becomes soft, shrunken, and atrophic with disorganized internal structures,.
    *   **Square shape:** The shrunken eye may appear square due to the pressure of the four rectus muscles.
    *   **Calcification/Ossification:** Intraocular bone formation may occur in the choroid.
*   **[[Atrophic Bulbi]]:**
    *   Distinct from phthisis; the globe is shrunken but the layers of the eyeball (sclera, choroid, retina) can still be distinguished, unlike the total disorganization in phthisis.

### Clinical Implications & Management

| Complication | Clinical Implication | Primary Management Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CME** | Principal cause of vision loss. | Systemic/Periocular steroids, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, Anti-VEGF. |
| **Secondary Glaucoma** | Silent thief of sight; nerve damage. | IOP lowering agents (Timolol/Acetazolamide); Surgery (Trabeculectomy/Valve) if medical tx fails. |
| **Complicated Cataract** | Visual obstruction; hinders fundus view. | Surgery under steroid cover (only when eye is quiet). |
| **Band Shaped Keratopathy** | Reduces vision; causes irregularity. | Chelation with EDTA. |
| **Phthisis Bulbi** | Cosmetic blemish; blind eye. | No visual potential; Artificial eye (prosthesis) for cosmesis. |
