# [[HEALTH INFORMATION & BASIC MEDICAL STATISTICS]] > Enlist the probability sampling methods. Elaborate on any 2 methods

### Probability Sampling Methods

Probability sampling, also known as **random sampling**, is a method where every unit in the population has a known (non-zero) chance of being selected. This eliminates selection bias and allows for the calculation of sampling error.

**Enlistment of Probability Sampling Methods:**
1.  **[[Simple Random Sampling]]**
2.  **[[Systematic Random Sampling]]**
3.  **[[Stratified Random Sampling]]**
4.  **[[Multistage Random Sampling]]**
5.  **[[Multiphase Random Sampling]]**
6.  **[[Cluster Random Sampling]]**,

### Elaboration of Selected Methods

#### 1. [[Simple Random Sampling]]

Also known as **"Unrestricted Random Sampling,"** this is the most basic form of probability sampling.

*   **Principle:** Every unit of the population has an **equal and known chance** of being selected,.
*   **Prerequisites:** It is most applicable when the population is:
    *   Small
    *   Homogeneous (similar characteristics)
    *   Readily available (a complete list or sampling frame exists),.
*   **Methodology:**
    1.  **Lottery Method:** Numbering units on cards, shuffling them, and drawing them out blindly.
    2.  **Table of Random Numbers:** Using published tables (like Fisher's tables) to select units based on assigned serial numbers,.
    3.  **Computer Software:** Generating random numbers digitally.
*   **Advantages:** It eliminates personal bias and allows for the calculation of sampling error.

**Clinical Relevance:**
This method is frequently used in **[[Clinical Trials]]** (e.g., testing the efficacy of a new drug) where patients meeting inclusion criteria are randomly selected to minimize selection bias.

#### 2. [[Stratified Random Sampling]]

This method is employed when the population is **heterogeneous** (dissimilar).

*   **Principle:** The population is first divided into homogeneous groups or classes called **"Strata"** based on specific characteristics (e.g., age, sex, socioeconomic status). A random sample is then drawn from *each* stratum, usually in proportion to its size in the total population,,.
*   **Methodology:**
    1.  Identify the variable that causes heterogeneity (e.g., gender).
    2.  Divide the population into strata (e.g., Males and Females).
    3.  Apply [[Simple Random Sampling]] within each stratum to select the subjects.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   **Representativeness:** It ensures that no sub-group is under-represented or over-represented.
    *   **Precision:** It provides greater accuracy and precision compared to simple random sampling because variability within strata is lower,.

**Clinical Relevance:**
If a researcher wants to estimate hemoglobin levels in a population of 1000 people (700 males and 300 females), a simple random sample might accidentally select mostly males. By using stratified sampling, the researcher ensures the sample includes males and females in the correct **7:3 ratio**, providing a true picture of the community's health status.
