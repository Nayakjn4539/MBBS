# [[Diseases Of Lens]] > Congenital Cataract

# Congenital and Developmental Cataract

**Definition:** [[Congenital cataract]] refers to any opacity in the [[crystalline lens]] or its capsule present at birth. **Developmental cataract** may occur from infancy to adolescence. These opacities occur due to a disturbance in the normal growth of the lens fibers; fibers laid down before and after the disturbance are usually clear.

### Etiology and Risk Factors

Approximately **1/3rd are idiopathic**, **1/3rd are hereditary**, and **1/3rd are due to systemic/maternal causes**.,

**1. Heredity (Genetic)**
*   **Autosomal Dominant (AD):** Most common mode of inheritance for isolated familial cataracts.,
*   **Autosomal Recessive (AR):** Seen in metabolic disorders.
*   **X-linked:** eg., [[Lowe's syndrome]].

**2. Maternal Factors (Intrauterine)**
*   **Infections (TORCH):**
    *   **Rubella:** Most common infective cause (50% of cases). Risk is highest in the **1st trimester** (2nd-3rd month).,
    *   Toxoplasmosis, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Herpes Simplex, Syphilis.
*   **Malnutrition:** Maternal malnutrition leads to non-familial [[zonular cataract]].
*   **Drugs/Radiation:** Use of [[corticosteroids]], thalidomide, or exposure to radiation during pregnancy.,

**3. Fetal or Infantile Factors**
*   **Metabolic Disorders:**
    *   [[Galactosemia]]: Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GPUT) deficiency or Galactokinase deficiency.
    *   **Neonatal Hypoglycemia.**
    *   **Hypocalcemia:** Associated with zonular cataract.
*   **Chromosomal Anomalies:**
    *   [[Down syndrome]] (Trisomy 21).
    *   Patau syndrome (Trisomy 13).
*   **Birth Trauma:** Forceps delivery.
*   **Ocular Associations:** [[Aniridia]], [[Persistent Hyperplastic Primary Vitreous]] (PHPV), Microphthalmos, Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP).

> **Mnemonic for Causes:** **C** (Congenital rubella/CMV) **H** (Hypoglycemia/Hypocalcemia) **I** (Idiopathic/Infections) **L** (Lowe's syndrome) **D** (Down syndrome/Drugs)

### Morphology and Clinical Types

Morphologically, congenital cataracts are classified based on the location and shape of the opacity.

| Type | Features & Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Capsular Cataract]]** | **Anterior:** Thickened white plaque centrally. **Posterior:** Associated with persistent hyaloid artery remnants ([[Mittendorf dot]])., |
| **[[Polar Cataract]]** | **Anterior Polar:** Pyramidal shape; due to delayed anterior chamber formation or corneal perforation. <br> **Posterior Polar:** Onion whorl appearance; associated with posterior lenticonus or PHPV. Stationary or progressive., |
| **[[Nuclear Cataract]]** | **Cataracta Centralis Pulverulenta:** Powdery opacity in embryonic nucleus (genetic). <br> **Total Nuclear:** Dense chalky white central opacity; involves embryonic/fetal nucleus. Severe visual loss., |
| **[[Lamellar Cataract]]** (Zonular) | **Most common type causing visual impairment** (50% cases). <br> **Appearance:** Opacity occupies a discrete zone (fetal nucleus) with clear center and clear cortex. **Riders** (spoke-like opacities) run towards the equator. <br> **Etiology:** Malnutrition, Vitamin D deficiency, Hypocalcemia.,, |
| **[[Sutural Cataract]]** | Opacities along the Y-sutures (Anterior erect Y, Posterior inverted Y). Usually static and do not affect vision., |
| **[[Coronary Cataract]]** | Club-shaped opacities in the periphery (corona) encircling the central axis. Occurs at puberty. Vision usually unaffected., |
| **[[Blue Dot Cataract]]** | **Most common congenital cataract overall.** <br> Also called *Cataracta Punctata Caerulea*. Multiple bluish dots in peripheral nucleus/cortex. Visually insignificant., |
| **[[Total Congenital Cataract]]** | Complete opacification of the lens. Often bilateral. Rubella is a common cause., |
| **Membranous Cataract** | Total/partial absorption of lens matter leaving thin membrane. |

### Specific Etiopathogenesis and Clinical Features

#### 1. Congenital Rubella Syndrome
*   **Pathogenesis:** Viral invasion of the lens in the first trimester interferes with DNA replication. The nucleus becomes necrotic.
*   **Morphology:** **Pearly white nuclear cataract**.,
*   **Key Feature:** The virus persists in the lens for up to 3 years. Surgery can trigger severe inflammation ([[endophthalmitis]]/uveitis).
*   **Triad:** Cataract, Sensorineural Deafness, Cardiac defects (PDA).

#### 2. Galactosemia
*   **Pathogenesis:** Inability to metabolize galactose leads to accumulation of **galactitol** (sugar alcohol) in the lens $\rightarrow$ Osmotic over-hydration.,
*   **Morphology:** **Oil droplet cataract** (central opacity).
*   **Management:** Reversible if milk/galactose is removed from diet early.

#### 3. Lowe’s Syndrome (Oculocerebrorenal Syndrome)
*   **Inheritance:** X-linked recessive.
*   **Pathogenesis:** Inborn error of amino acid metabolism.
*   **Features:** Bilateral cataract, [[posterior lenticonus]], microphakia, glaucoma, mental retardation, renal failure.,

### Management of Congenital Cataract

#### 1. Evaluation and Workup
*   **History:** Maternal illness (rash/fever), drug intake, birth weight, family history.
*   **Ocular Exam:**
    *   Assess visual behavior (fixation reflex, nystagmus).
    *   Density of cataract (Red reflex quality).
    *   Associated anomalies: Microcornea, aniridia.
    *   **USG B-scan:** Essential in total cataract to rule out Retinoblastoma or Retinal Detachment.
*   **Laboratory Tests:**
    *   **TORCH titers** (IgM).
    *   **Urine reducing substances** (after milk feed) for Galactosemia.,
    *   Urine chromatography (Lowe's syndrome).

#### 2. Indications for Surgery
*   **Total/Dense Cataract:** Immediate surgery required to prevent [[stimulus deprivation amblyopia]].
*   **Partial Cataract:** Observe if fundus is visible and child fixes well. Use pupillary dilation (mydriatics) if opacity is small and central.

#### 3. Timing of Surgery
*   **Unilateral Dense Cataract:** Urgent! Operate within **days to weeks** (ideally < 6 weeks) to prevent dense amblyopia.,
*   **Bilateral Dense Cataract:** Operate at **6–8 weeks** of age. Operate the second eye within a few days of the first.

#### 4. Surgical Techniques
The standard procedure is **Lens Aspiration** (or Lensectomy) via a limbal or pars plana approach.
*   **Step 1: Incision:** Clear corneal or scleral tunnel (MICS preferred).
*   **Step 2: Anterior [[Capsulorhexis]] (CCC):** Challenging due to elastic capsule in children.
*   **Step 3: Aspiration:** Irrigation and aspiration of soft lens matter (Nucleus is not hard, so phacoemulsification power is rarely needed).
*   **Step 4: Primary Posterior Capsulotomy (PPC) + Anterior Vitrectomy (AV):** **Mandatory** in children < 6-8 years.
    *   *Reason:* The posterior capsule opacifies rapidly (PCO) in children because of highly active epithelial cells. AV removes the scaffold for cell proliferation.,
*   **Step 5: [[Intraocular Lens]] (IOL) Implantation:**
    *   Usually implanted in children > 2 years.
    *   **Material:** Hydrophobic Acrylic (preferred).
    *   **Site:** In the bag.
    *   **Power Calculation:** Target under-correction (hypermetropia) because the eye will grow and become myopic (myopic shift).
        *   < 2 years: Under-correct by 20%.
        *   2-8 years: Under-correct by 10%.,

#### 5. Visual Rehabilitation
*   **Correction of [[Aphakia]]:**
    *   **IOL:** Best option if age permits.
    *   **Contact Lenses:** Extended wear silicone lenses (Best for infants/unilateral aphakia).
    *   **Spectacles:** Used in bilateral aphakia (heavy, prismatic effect).
*   **Amblyopia Therapy:** **Crucial.** Post-operative occlusion (patching) of the normal eye is required to force the brain to use the operated eye.
