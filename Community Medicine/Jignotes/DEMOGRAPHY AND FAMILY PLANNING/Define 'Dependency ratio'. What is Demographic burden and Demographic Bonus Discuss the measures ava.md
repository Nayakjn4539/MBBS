# [[DEMOGRAPHY AND FAMILY PLANNING]] > Define 'Dependency ratio'. What is "Demographic burden" and "Demographic Bonus"? Discuss the measures available to prevent declining sex ratio.

### 1. Dependency Ratio

**Definition**
The [[Dependency Ratio]] is defined as the ratio of the combined age groups of children (0–14 years) and the aged (65 years and above) to the population of the economically productive age group (15–64 years).

**Formula**
$$ \text{Total Dependency Ratio} = \frac{\text{Population } 0\text{-}14 \text{ years} + \text{Population } > 65 \text{ years}}{\text{Population } 15\text{-}64 \text{ years}} \times 100 $$

**Types**
1.  **Young Age Dependency Ratio:** The ratio of children (0-14 years) to the working-age population.
2.  **Old Age Dependency Ratio:** The ratio of the elderly (>65 years) to the working-age population.

**Interpretation**
*   It reflects the need for a society to provide for its non-earning groups (younger and older).
*   A higher ratio indicates a greater strain on the productive part of the population to support the upbringing of children and pensions for the elderly.
*   **Current Status:** In India (Census 2011), the dependency ratio was roughly **54 per 100** (0.54).

### 2. Demographic Concepts

#### A. Demographic Bonus (Demographic Dividend/Gift)
*   **Definition:** It is the period when the [[Dependency Ratio]] in a population declines significantly because of a rapid decline in fertility.
*   **Mechanism:** As fertility drops, the proportion of children (young dependents) decreases, while the proportion of the working-age population (15–64 years) increases relative to dependents.
*   **Significance:** If the switch to small families is fast, this "bonus" can provide a considerable push to economic development, provided investments are made in health, education, and skill development. It is essentially a "window of opportunity".

#### B. Demographic Burden
*   **Definition:** It connotes the **increase** in the total [[Dependency Ratio]] during any period of time.
*   **Cause:** It is mostly caused by an increased **old-age dependency ratio**.
*   **Context:** This occurs in the later stages of the demographic transition. As life expectancy increases and fertility remains low, the proportion of the elderly rises, creating a liability or burden on the economy and healthcare infrastructure.

| Feature | Demographic Bonus | Demographic Burden |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trend** | Decreasing Dependency Ratio | Increasing Dependency Ratio |
| **Driver** | Decline in fertility (fewer children) | Increase in longevity (more elderly) |
| **Economic Impact** | Potential for rapid growth | Strain on resources/pension |

### 3. Measures to Prevent Declining Sex Ratio

The [[Sex Ratio]] in India (defined as number of females per 1000 males) has historically been adverse to women. To correct this, a multi-pronged strategy is required:

#### A. Legislative Measures
*   **Strict Enforcement of PC-PNDT Act:** Rigorous implementation of the **Pre-conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques Act, 1994**. This includes:
    *   Banning the use of sex selection techniques after conception.
    *   Preventing the misuse of prenatal diagnostic techniques (like USG) for sex-selective abortions.
    *   Regulating genetic counseling centers and laboratories.
*   **Ban on Sex Determination:** Complete prohibition of sex determination tests to stop female feticide.
*   **Legal Action:** Punishment for violations must be stringent to act as a deterrent.

#### B. Social and Educational Measures
*   **Empowerment of Women:** Enhancing the status of women in society through education and employment opportunities.
*   **Girl Child Education:** Vigorous campaigns for meaningful education of the girl child to reduce gender bias.
*   **Raising Marriage Age:** Promoting delayed marriage for girls (preferably after 20 years).
*   **Social Welfare Programs:**
    *   **[[Beti Bachao Beti Padhao]]** (Save the girl child, educate the girl child) campaign to change mindsets.
    *   Elimination of adverse socio-cultural practices like dowry and child neglect.

#### C. Health and Surveillance Measures
*   **Audit of Ultrasound Clinics:** Regular monitoring and auditing of ultrasound clinics to prevent illegal sex determination.
*   **Death Registration:** 100% registration of births and deaths to track infant mortality by gender.
*   **Prevention of Infanticide:** Strict vigilance to stop female infanticide, particularly in high-risk states.
