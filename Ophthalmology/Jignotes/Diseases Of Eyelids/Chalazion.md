# Chalazion (Meibomian Cyst / Tarsal Cyst)

### Definition
A **Chalazion** is a chronic, non-infective, **lipogranulomatous inflammation** of the [[Meibomian gland]]. It is the most common of all lid lumps.

### Etiopathogenesis
1.  **Predisposing Factors:** Similar to [[Hordeolum externum]]; often associated with [[Chronic blepharitis]], [[Acne rosacea]], and [[Seborrheic dermatitis]].
2.  **Mechanism:**
    *   Mild grade infection of the meibomian gland by organisms of low virulence.
    *   Proliferation of epithelium and infiltration of duct walls leads to blockage of the duct.
    *   Retention of secretions (**sebum**) causes gland enlargement.
    *   Extravasated fatty secretions act as an irritant, exciting a **non-infective lipogranulomatous inflammation** in the surrounding tissue.

### Histopathology
*   It is a **lipogranuloma**.
*   Central portion: Retained sebaceous secretions and cell debris.
*   Surrounded by: Granulation tissue containing **Epithelioid cells**, **Giant cells** (Foreign body type), Lymphocytes, and Plasma cells.

### Clinical Features
**Demographics:** Occurs at any age; more common in adults than children.

#### Symptoms
*   **Painless swelling** in the eyelid (hallmark feature).
*   Gradual increase in size.
*   Mild heaviness in the lid.
*   **Blurred vision:** Occurs if a very large chalazion presses on the cornea, inducing [[Astigmatism]].
*   **Epiphora (Watering):** If a large chalazion eversion the lower punctum.

#### Signs
*   **Location:** Nodule is situated slightly **away from the lid margin**.
*   **Site:** More common in the **upper lid** (as the upper lid contains more [[Meibomian glands]] compared to the lower lid).
*   **Consistency:** Firm to hard.
*   **Tenderness:** Non-tender (unlike a stye).
*   **Mobility:** Overlying skin is usually freely mobile.
*   **Pointing:** On eversion of the lid, the conjunctiva over the swelling appears as a **reddish-purple** or grey area (where the chalazion points).
*   **Marginal Chalazion:** A variant presenting as a small reddish-grey nodule on the lid margin.

### Clinical Course and Complications
1.  **Spontaneous Resolution:** Rare; may disappear completely.
2.  **Fungating Mass:** The lesion may burst on the conjunctival side, forming a fungating mass of granulation tissue.
3.  **Secondary Infection:** Can convert into [[Hordeolum internum]] (infected chalazion).
4.  **Calcification:** Rare occurrence.
5.  **Mechanical Ptosis:** Large or multiple chalazia can weigh down the lid.
6.  **Malignancy:** Malignant change into [[Sebaceous gland carcinoma]] (Meibomian gland carcinoma) may occur, especially in elderly patients.

### Differential Diagnosis
| Feature | Chalazion | Hordeolum Internum | Hordeolum Externum (Stye) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pathology** | Chronic Lipogranulomatous inflammation | Acute Suppurative inflammation | Acute Suppurative inflammation |
| **Site** | [[Meibomian gland]] | [[Meibomian gland]] | Gland of [[Zeis]] or [[Moll]] |
| **Presentation** | Painless nodule | Painful swelling | Painful swelling at lid margin |
| **Tenderness** | Absent | Present | Present |
| **Location** | Away from lid margin | Tarsal plate area | Lid margin |

### Treatment

#### 1. Conservative Management
*   Indicated for small, soft, recent chalazia.
*   **Hot fomentation**.
*   Topical antibiotic drops and oral anti-inflammatory drugs.
*   Lid hygiene.

#### 2. Intralesional Injection
*   Injection of long-acting steroid (**Triamcinolone acetonide**).
*   Indicated for small/soft chalazia, those near the [[Punctum]] (where surgery risks damage), or if the patient refuses surgery.
*   Resolution occurs in ~50% of cases.

#### 3. Surgical Management: Incision and Curettage (I&C)
This is the conventional treatment for established chalazia.

**Steps of Surgery:**
1.  **Anesthesia:** Surface anesthesia (4% Xylocaine drops) + Infiltration anesthesia (2% Xylocaine) into the lid around the chalazion.
2.  **Clamping:** A **Chalazion clamp** is applied.
    *   Ring side on the conjunctival surface (usually).
    *   Plate side on the skin surface.
    *   *Note:* If the chalazion points towards the skin, the incision is made on the skin; otherwise, it is conjunctival.
3.  **Incision:**
    *   **Conjunctival side:** **Vertical incision** is made to avoid injury to adjacent parallel [[Meibomian gland]] ducts.
    *   **Skin side:** **Horizontal incision** is made (parallel to skin creases/Langer’s lines) to minimize scarring.
4.  **Curettage:** Contents are scooped out using a **Chalazion scoop**.
5.  **Cautery:** The cavity is cauterized with **Carbolic acid** followed by neutralization with methylated spirit to destroy the epithelial lining and prevent recurrence.
6.  **Aftercare:** Antibiotic ointment and patching for 6–12 hours.

#### 4. Diathermy
*   Treatment of choice for **Marginal Chalazion**.

#### 5. Systemic Prophylaxis
*   **Oral Tetracycline/Doxycycline:** Prescribed for recurrent chalazia, especially if associated with [[Acne rosacea]] or [[Seborrheic dermatitis]], to alter glandular secretions.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Recurrent Chalazion:** Any recurrent chalazion, especially in an elderly patient, **must be biopsied** to rule out **[[Sebaceous cell carcinoma]]** (Meibomian gland carcinoma).
*   **Refractive Error:** A large chalazion can induce **mechanical [[Astigmatism]]**, leading to blurred vision.
