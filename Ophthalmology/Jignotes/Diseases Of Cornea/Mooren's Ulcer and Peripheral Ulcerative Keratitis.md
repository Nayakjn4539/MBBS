# Peripheral Ulcerative Keratitis (PUK)

[[Peripheral ulcerative keratitis]] (PUK) refers to a group of inflammatory diseases characterized by thinning and/or ulceration of the peripheral cornea. It is a critical condition as it often signals potentially life-threatening systemic vasculitis,.

### Etiology and Associations
PUK can be infectious or non-infectious. Non-infectious causes are often associated with systemic collagen vascular disorders.

**1. Connective Tissue Diseases (Autoimmune):**
*   **[[Rheumatoid Arthritis]] (RA):** The most common systemic association. May present as **Sclerosing keratitis** or acute corneal melting known as **"Contact lens cornea"**,.
*   **[[Wegener's Granulomatosis]] (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis):** PUK may be the initial presentation.
*   **[[Polyarteritis Nodosa]] (PAN):** Can cause severe, rapid ulceration,.
*   **[[Systemic Lupus Erythematosus]] (SLE):** Less common than RA,.
*   **Relapsing Polychondritis.**

**2. Infectious Causes:**
*   **Bacterial:** *Staphylococcus* (Marginal keratitis/Catarrhal ulcer due to hypersensitivity),.
*   **Viral:** [[Herpes Simplex]], [[Herpes Zoster]].
*   **Parasitic:** *Acanthamoeba*.

**3. Idiopathic:**
*   [[Mooren's Ulcer]] (Diagnosis of exclusion).

### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:** Pain, photophobia, tearing, and decreased vision.
*   **Signs:**
    *   Crescentic ulceration at the limbus.
    *   **Stromal thinning/melting:** Can lead to gutter formation.
    *   **Inflammation:** Adjacent conjunctival and episcleral inflammation is common.
    *   **Progression:** May progress to **[[Descemetocele]]** or perforation.

### Management
*   **Investigation:** Full systemic workup (ESR, RF, ANCA, Chest X-ray) to rule out lethal systemic vasculitis.
*   **Local Therapy:** Lubricants, antibiotics (prophylaxis), bandage contact lens, cyanoacrylate glue for thinning. **Caution:** Topical steroids must be used with extreme care as they may accelerate thinning.
*   **Systemic Therapy:** Treatment of the underlying condition is crucial. Systemic steroids and immunosuppressives (e.g., [[Methotrexate]], [[Cyclophosphamide]]) are often required.
*   **Surgery:** Resection of adjacent inflamed conjunctiva (peritomy) to remove the source of collagenases.

# Mooren's Ulcer (Chronic Serpiginous/Rodent Ulcer)

**[[Mooren's ulcer]]** is a rare, painful, idiopathic, chronic, progressive, peripheral ulcerative keratitis. It is a diagnosis of exclusion,.

### Etiology and Pathogenesis
*   **Exact cause:** Unknown (Idiopathic).
*   **Mechanism:** Likely **autoimmune**.
    *   Antibodies against **[[corneal epithelium]]** have been demonstrated.
    *   Evidence of cell-mediated immunity (Type IV hypersensitivity).
    *   **Enzymatic destruction:** Collagenase and proteoglycanase produced by the adjacent conjunctiva cause ischemic necrosis due to vasculitis of limbal vessels.
    *   **Note:** It involves the cornea but the *sclera remains uninvolved*.

### Clinical Classification
Mooren's ulcer is clinically divided into two distinct types based on severity and epidemiology,.

| Feature | **Type 1: Limited/Benign Form** | **Type 2: Progressive/Virulent Form** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Age Group** | Elderly patients (usually >60 years) | Young adults (usually Africans) |
| **Laterality** | Usually **Unilateral** (75%) | Usually **Bilateral** (75%) |
| **Symptoms** | Moderate pain | **Severe, excruciating pain** |
| **Progression** | Slow progression; self-limiting | Rapid progression; relentless |
| **Response to Rx** | Good response to medical therapy | Poor response; difficult to treat |
| **Vascular involvement** | Minimal | Severe ischemic necrosis |

### Clinical Features
**Symptoms:**
*   **Pain:** Severe, persistent, neuralgic pain (out of proportion to signs),.
*   **Photophobia** and lacrimation.
*   Defective vision (due to irregular astigmatism or central involvement).

**Signs:**
1.  **Initial Lesion:** Starts as grey infiltrates at the corneal margin (limbus),.
2.  **Ulceration:** These coalesce to form a shallow furrow or gutter.
3.  **The Overhanging Edge:** The hallmark sign. The ulcer spreads circumferentially and axially, undermining the epithelium and superficial stroma, creating a **whitish overhanging edge** at the advancing border,,.
4.  **Vascularization:** The base of the ulcer becomes vascularized quickly.
5.  **End Stage:** The cornea becomes thinned, opaque, and conjunctivalized (pseudopterygium may form).
6.  **Perforation:** Rare, but can occur in virulent forms or with mild trauma,.

### Management
Treatment is challenging and often unsatisfactory.

**1. Medical Management:**
*   **Topical Steroids:** Intensive hourly instillation in the acute phase. Limited success,.
*   **Systemic Therapy:**
    *   **Systemic Steroids:** Used for immunosuppression.
    *   **Immunosuppressives:** Cytotoxic drugs like **[[Cyclophosphamide]]**, **[[Azathioprine]]**, or **[[Cyclosporine]]** are indicated, especially for the bilateral virulent type,.
*   **Topical Cyclosporine:** May be helpful.
*   **Artificial Tears:** For symptomatic relief.

**2. Surgical Management:**
*   **Conjunctival Resection/Excision (Peritomy):** Excision of a 3-4 mm strip of conjunctiva adjacent to the ulcer (limbal peritomy).
    *   *Mechanism:* Removes the source of collagenolytic enzymes and inflammatory mediators produced by the conjunctiva,.
*   **Tissue Adhesive:** Cyanoacrylate glue with a bandage contact lens for thinning or small perforations.
*   **Keratoplasty:** Lamellar or penetrating keratoplasty.
    *   *Prognosis:* Poor; grafts often melt or become vascularized due to recurrence of the disease,.

### Clinical Implications: Differentiating PUK
When a patient presents with peripheral corneal melting, it is vital to differentiate **Mooren's Ulcer** from **Systemic Vasculitis-associated PUK** (e.g., RA or Wegener's).
*   **Scleral Involvement:** PUK with systemic disease often has associated **[[scleritis]]**. Mooren's ulcer strictly affects the cornea; the sclera is uninvolved.
*   **Pain:** Mooren's ulcer causes excruciating pain, often more severe than other forms of PUK.
