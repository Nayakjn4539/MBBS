# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > OPV

# Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV)

**OPV** (also known as the **Sabin vaccine**) is a **live attenuated** liquid vaccine used to protect against Poliomyelitis. It is the cornerstone of the global polio eradication initiative due to its ability to induce mucosal immunity and stop transmission.

### 1. Description and Composition
*   **Type:** [[Live Attenuated Vaccine]] (Liquid form).
*   **Strains:** Prepared from attenuated strains of Polio virus types 1, 2, and 3 grown in primary monkey kidney or human diploid cell cultures.
*   **Stabilizer:** **Magnesium Chloride** ($MgCl_2$) is added as a stabilizer to preserve potency.
*   **Types of OPV:**
    *   **Trivalent (tOPV):** Contained Types 1, 2, and 3. (Discontinued globally in April 2016).
    *   **Bivalent (bOPV):** Contains Types 1 and 3. Currently used in the [[National Immunization Schedule]].
    *   **Monovalent (mOPV):** Contains only Type 1 or Type 3 (used in outbreak responses).

### 2. Dose, Route, and Administration
*   **Dose:** **2 Drops** (approx. 0.1 ml).
*   **Route:** **Oral**.
*   **Technique:** The dropper is used to deliver drops directly onto the tongue.
    *   *Note:* If the child spits out the vaccine or vomits immediately, the dose should be **repeated** immediately.

### 3. Immunization Schedule (India)
According to the [[National Immunization Schedule]] (NIS):

| Dose | Age of Administration | Remarks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Zero Dose** | **At Birth** (within first 15 days) | Given at institutional delivery. |
| **1st Dose** | **6 Weeks** | Given with Pentavalent-1, Rotavirus-1, fIPV-1. |
| **2nd Dose** | **10 Weeks** | Given with Pentavalent-2, Rotavirus-2. |
| **3rd Dose** | **14 Weeks** | Given with Pentavalent-3, Rotavirus-3, fIPV-2. |
| **Booster** | **16-24 Months** | Given with DPT Booster-1. |

> **Pulse Polio Immunization (PPI):** Additional doses are given to **all children aged 0-5 years** on National Immunization Days (NIDs) regardless of previous immunization status.

### 4. Mechanism of Action
OPV mimics a natural infection without causing paralysis.
1.  **Local Immunity (Intestinal):** Induces Secretory **IgA** in the gut mucosa (Peyer's patches). This prevents the wild virus from multiplying in the intestine ("Gut Immunity"), thereby breaking the chain of transmission.
2.  **Humoral Immunity (Systemic):** Stimulates production of IgM and IgG in the blood, preventing the virus from reaching the CNS (preventing paralysis).
3.  **Herd Immunity:** The vaccine virus is excreted in the feces of the vaccinated child, spreading secondarily to close contacts and immunizing them indirectly.

### 5. Advantages vs. Disadvantages

| **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Easy to administer (Oral drops); no trained staff required. | **Thermolabile:** Requires strict [[Cold Chain]] maintenance. |
| Induces **Intestinal Immunity** (prevents carrier state). | Risk of **VAPP** (Vaccine Associated Paralytic Polio). |
| Relatively inexpensive. | Risk of **VDPV** (Vaccine Derived Polio Virus) due to mutation. |
| Useful in controlling **epidemics** (rapid coverage). | Interference by other enteroviruses in the gut may reduce efficacy (needs multiple doses). |
| Provides **Herd Immunity**. | |

### 6. Complications
*   **VAPP (Vaccine Associated Paralytic Polio):** Rare condition (approx. 1 in 1 million/2.7 million doses) where the attenuated virus reverts to neurovirulence, causing paralysis in the recipient or a contact. It is most frequently associated with **Type 3** strain.
*   **VDPV (Vaccine Derived Polio Virus):** Genetically mutated strains of the vaccine virus that can circulate in populations with low immunity coverage (cVDPV).

### 7. Cold Chain and Storage
OPV is **Heat Sensitive** (Thermolabile).
*   **Long-term storage:** Deep freezers at **-20°C to -40°C**.
*   **Peripheral use (PHC/Sub-center):** Stored in [[Ice Lined Refrigerator]] (ILR) at **+2°C to +8°C**.
*   **Transportation:** Carried in vaccine carriers with 4 frozen ice packs.

#### Vaccine Vial Monitor (VVM)
A heat-sensitive label on the vial to monitor cumulative heat exposure.

*   **Grade III:** Inner square matches outer circle $\rightarrow$ **DISCARD**.
*   **Grade IV:** Inner square is darker than outer circle $\rightarrow$ **DISCARD**.

> *   **White** is Right (Use it).
> *   **Blue** is Through (Discard it).

### 8. The "Switch" (April 2016)
Globally, **tOPV** (Trivalent) was switched to **bOPV** (Bivalent: Types 1 & 3).
*   **Reason:** Wild Polio Virus Type 2 was eradicated (1999), and the Type 2 component in the vaccine was the primary cause of VAPP/VDPV outbreaks. Therefore, Type 2 was removed to improve safety.
*   **IPV Introduction:** Inactivated Polio Vaccine ([[IPV]]) was introduced to maintain immunity against Type 2.

### 9. Contraindications
*   **Absolute:** Known severe hypersensitivity to previous dose or vaccine components (e.g., Neomycin).
*   **Immunodeficiency:**
    *   OPV is **Contraindicated** in children with known primary immunodeficiency or symptomatic HIV/AIDS.
    *   **WHO Note:** Asymptomatic HIV infection is **NOT** a contraindication for OPV in endemic areas.
    *   It is contraindicated in household contacts of immunodeficient persons (risk of secondary transmission).
    *   **Alternative:** Use IPV (Killed vaccine) for immunocompromised patients.
*   **Diarrhea:** Not a contraindication. Give the dose, but **do not count it** in the schedule. Give an extra dose later.

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Polio Eradication:** India was declared Polio-free on **27th March 2014**. The last case was reported in Howrah, West Bengal, on **13th January 2011**.
*   **Pulse Polio:** The strategy of "Pulse Polio" relies exclusively on OPV to flood the environment with vaccine virus and displace the wild virus.
