# [[Diseases Of Retina]] > Opthalmoscopy findings

### Ophthalmoscopy Techniques and Normal Findings

[[Ophthalmoscopy]] is a clinical examination of the interior of the eye (fundus) to assess the retina, optic disc, macula, and vessels.

**Types of Ophthalmoscopy:**
*   **Direct Ophthalmoscopy:** Provides a uniocular, erect, and magnified image (15x). Best for examining the central fundus and [[Optic Disc]] details,.
*   **Indirect Ophthalmoscopy:** Provides a binocular, inverted, real, and less magnified image (2.5x to 5x). Best for examining the [[Peripheral Retina]] and hazy media.
*   **Slit-Lamp Biomicroscopy:** Uses +78D or +90D lenses for a stereoscopic, magnified view of the posterior pole.

#### Normal Fundus Findings
A systematic examination of the fundus should evaluate the following structures:

| Structure | Normal Appearance | Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Media** | Transparent | Clarity ensures visible fundus details. |
| **[[Optic Disc]]** | Pinkish with a central pallor (Physiological Cup). Vertically oval (1.5mm diameter). Margins are well-defined. | Represents the optic nerve head. |
| **Cup-Disc Ratio (CDR)** | Normally 0.3 to 0.4. | Represents the ratio of the cup size to the disc size. |
| **[[Macula]]** | Darker than surrounding retina. Located temporal to the disc. Central foveal reflex (bright spot) present. | Area of highest visual acuity (cones). |
| **Retinal Vessels** | Arteries are bright red; Veins are purplish and thicker. A:V Ratio = 2:3. | Arteries do not anastomose; veins may show spontaneous pulsation. |
| **Background** | Uniformly orange-red/pinkish. | Varies with race (tessellated/tigroid in pigmented individuals). |

### Abnormal Optic Disc Findings

#### 1. Disc Edema and Hyperemia
Swelling of the optic nerve head often associated with blurred margins.
*   **[[Papilledema]]:** Bilateral disc edema due to raised intracranial pressure (ICP).
    *   *Features:* Hyperemic disc, blurred margins (nasal first), obliteration of the physiological cup, loss of spontaneous venous pulsation, peripapillary hemorrhages, and Paton’s lines (circumferential retinal folds),.
*   **[[Papillitis]] (Optic Neuritis):** Inflammation of the optic nerve head.
    *   *Features:* Disc hyperemia, moderate swelling (2-3 D), blurred margins. Associated with sudden vision loss and pain on eye movement.
*   **Pseudopapilledema:** Apparent swelling seen in hypermetropia or [[Optic Disc Drusen]] (calcified bodies). Margins are blurred but no venous congestion or exudates.

#### 2. Optic Atrophy (Pallor)
Degeneration of optic nerve fibers leads to loss of pink color (pallor) due to loss of vasculature.

*   **Primary Optic Atrophy:**
    *   *Appearance:* Chalky white disc, sharply defined margins, lamina cribrosa visible.
    *   *Causes:* Syphilis, Trauma, Leber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy,.
*   **Secondary (Post-Neuritic) Atrophy:**
    *   *Appearance:* Dirty grey/white disc, blurred margins, obscured lamina cribrosa (filled with gliosis).
    *   *Causes:* Long-standing papilledema or papillitis,.
*   **Consecutive Optic Atrophy:**
    *   *Appearance:* Waxy pale/yellowish disc, attenuated vessels.
    *   *Causes:* [[Retinitis Pigmentosa]], diffuse chorioretinitis,.
*   **Glaucomatous Optic Atrophy:**
    *   *Appearance:* Deep, wide cupping, nasal shift of vessels, bayoneting sign (vessels kinking at the edge), laminar dot sign (visible lamina cribrosa pores),.

#### 3. Pathological Cupping
*   **Glaucoma:** Vertical enlargement of the cup (CDR > 0.5 or asymmetry > 0.2 between eyes). Neuroretinal rim thinning (ISNT rule violation: Inferior and Superior rims thinned first).

### Abnormal Macular Findings

The macula is critical for central vision. Abnormalities here often result in significant visual loss or metamorphopsia.

*   **[[Cherry Red Spot]]:**
    *   *Appearance:* Shiny white/pale retina with a prominent red fovea.
    *   *Cause:* The retina becomes edematous/opaque (infarction or lipid storage), but the fovea remains red because it is thin and supplied by the underlying choroid.
    *   *Seen in:* [[Central Retinal Artery Occlusion]] (CRAO), Tay-Sachs disease, Niemann-Pick disease, Berlin's edema (trauma),,.
*   **[[Cystoid Macular Edema]] (CME):**
    *   *Appearance:* Loss of foveal depression, retinal thickening. "Flower petal" pattern on Fluorescein Angiography (FFA). Honeycomb appearance on slit lamp.
    *   *Seen in:* Post-cataract surgery (Irvine-Gass syndrome), Diabetic Retinopathy, Uveitis.
*   **Macular Star:**
    *   *Appearance:* Hard exudates arranged in a star pattern around the fovea.
    *   *Seen in:* Neuroretinitis, Malignant Hypertension (Grade 4), Coats disease,.
*   **[[Macular Hole]]:**
    *   *Appearance:* Round, reddish spot with a grey halo (cuff of subretinal fluid). Watzke-Allen test positive.
*   **Bull’s Eye Maculopathy:**
    *   *Appearance:* Ring of depigmentation surrounded by hyperpigmentation.
    *   *Seen in:* Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine toxicity, Cone dystrophy, Stargardt’s disease,.

### Abnormal Retinal Vascular Findings

#### 1. Arterial Changes
*   **Attenuation (Narrowing):** Seen in Hypertension (HTN), CRAO, Retinitis Pigmentosa,.
*   **Sclerosis (Wiring):**
    *   *Copper Wiring:* Reddish-brown reflex due to thickened vessel wall (Grade 3 HTN).
    *   *Silver Wiring:* Opaque white reflex, vessel appears as a white cord (Grade 4 HTN).
*   **Emboli:**
    *   *Hollenhorst Plaques:* Refractile/orange cholesterol crystals at bifurcations.

#### 2. Venous Changes
*   **Tortuosity and Dilatation:**
    *   *Seen in:* [[Central Retinal Vein Occlusion]] (CRVO), Diabetes, Hyperviscosity syndromes, Papilledema.
*   **Beading and Looping:**
    *   *Seen in:* Severe Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR).
*   **A-V Crossing Changes:** Hallmark of Hypertensive Retinopathy.
    *   *Salus Sign:* Deflection of veins at crossing.
    *   *Bonnet Sign:* Banking of veins distal to crossing.
    *   *Gunn Sign:* Tapering of veins on either side of crossing.

#### 3. Pulsations
*   **Venous Pulsation:** Spontaneous in 80% of normal individuals. **Loss of SVP** is an early sign of Papilledema,.
*   **Arterial Pulsation:** Always pathological. Seen in Glaucoma (pressure pulse) or Aortic Regurgitation.
