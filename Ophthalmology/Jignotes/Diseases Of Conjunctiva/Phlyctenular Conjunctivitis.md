# [[Diseases Of Conjunctiva]] > Phlyctenular Conjunctivitis

### Phlyctenular Conjunctivitis (Phlyctenulosis)

**Phlyctenular conjunctivitis** (also known as Phlyctenular Keratoconjunctivitis or PKC) is a characteristic nodular affection occurring as an allergic response of the conjunctival and corneal epithelium to some endogenous allergens to which they have become sensitized.

### Etiopathogenesis
It is a **Type IV cell-mediated delayed hypersensitivity reaction** to endogenous microbial proteins.

**1. Causative Allergens:**
*   **Tuberculous proteins:** Previously considered the most common cause; still a common cause in developing countries like India.
*   **Staphylococcal proteins:** Now considered the most common cause in many regions (especially Western countries).
*   **Other allergens:** Proteins from [[Moraxella Axenfeld]] bacillus and certain parasites (worm infestation).

**2. Predisposing Factors:**
*   **Age:** Peak age group is **3–15 years**.
*   **Sex:** Higher incidence in **girls** than boys.
*   **Nutrition:** More common in undernourished children.
*   **Living Conditions:** Associated with overcrowded and unhygienic living conditions.

### Clinical Features
The disease is usually **unilateral** (unlike [[Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis]] which is bilateral).

#### Symptoms
*   **Simple Phlyctenular Conjunctivitis:** Mild discomfort, irritation, and reflex watering.
*   **Photophobia:** Usually little or no photophobia unless the [[cornea]] is involved.
*   **Mucopurulent discharge:** Present only if there is an associated secondary bacterial infection.

#### Signs
The characteristic lesion is the **Phlycten** (a pinkish-white nodule near the limbus surrounded by hyperaemia).

**Types of Conjunctival Presentation:**
1.  **Simple Phlyctenular Conjunctivitis:**
    *   Most common variety.
    *   Presence of a typical pinkish-white nodule (phlycten) on the [[bulbar conjunctiva]], usually near the **limbus**.
    *   Surrounded by a zone of **hyperaemia** (congestion).
    *   The nodule ulcerates at the apex and later epithelizes.
    *   Disappears in 8–10 days leaving no trace (conjunctival ulcers heal without scarring).

2.  **Necrotizing Phlyctenular Conjunctivitis:**
    *   Presence of a very large phlycten with necrosis and ulceration leading to severe pustular conjunctivitis.

3.  **Miliary Phlyctenular Conjunctivitis:**
    *   Presence of multiple phlyctens arranged haphazardly or in the form of a ring around the limbus.
    *   May form a **ring ulcer**.

### Phlyctenular Keratitis (Corneal Involvement)
Corneal involvement generally occurs secondarily from the extension of a conjunctival phlycten. It is more serious as corneal ulcers can lead to opacities.

**Patterns of Corneal Ulceration:**
| Type of Ulcer | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Scrofulous Ulcer** | A shallow marginal ulcer formed due to the breakdown of a limbal phlycten. |
| **Fascicular Ulcer** | A prominent leash of blood vessels follows the ulcer as it creeps from the limbus towards the center of the cornea. It heals leaving a **band-shaped opacity**. |
| **Miliary Ulcer** | Multiple small ulcers scattered over the cornea. |

**Note:** **Diffuse infiltrative keratitis** may also occur, appearing as central corneal infiltration with rich vascularization from the periphery.

### Differential Diagnosis
1.  **Episcleritis:** Nodule is deeper; pain is present; congestion is deep violet/purple.
2.  **Scleritis:** Severe pain; deep congestion.
3.  **Conjunctival Foreign Body Granuloma**.
4.  **Viral Keratitis:** Differentiated by history and lack of typical phlycten nodule.

### Management
Treatment involves local therapy to control inflammation and specific therapy to eradicate the cause.

#### 1. Local Therapy
*   **[[Topical Corticosteroids]]:** (e.g., Dexamethasone or Betamethasone). They produce a dramatic effect and are the mainstay of treatment.
*   **Antibiotics:** Drops/ointment to treat associated secondary infection (often Staphylococcal).
*   **Cycloplegics:** [[Atropine]] (1%) eye ointment is applied if the **cornea** is involved to relieve ciliary spasm and prevent posterior synechiae.
*   **Dark Goggles:** To prevent [[photophobia]].

#### 2. Specific Therapy (Treating the Cause)
*   **Tuberculosis:** Exclude TB by Chest X-ray, Mantoux test, and ESR. If positive, start Antitubercular drugs.
*   **Septic Foci:** Treat tonsillitis, adenoids, or carious teeth.
*   **Parasitic Infestation:** Stool examination and deworming if necessary.

#### 3. General Measures
*   Improvement of health with a high-protein diet and administration of Vitamins A, C, and D.
