# [[Upper Limb]] > Supracondylar Fracture of Humerus

# [[Supracondylar Fracture of Humerus]]

A [[Supracondylar fracture]] is a fracture of the distal humerus occurring just above the epicondyles. It is the **most common fracture in children** (peak age 5-10 years) but is relatively rare in adults.

### Relevant Anatomy & Pathophysiology
*   **Location:** The supracondylar area is the weakest part of the humerus in children due to:
    *   Remodeling bone (metaphysis).
    *   Thin cortex and flattened shape.
    *   Fossa anteriorly ([[coronoid fossa]]) and posteriorly ([[olecranon fossa]]) making the bone thin "wafer-like".
*   **Three-Point Bony Relationship:** The relationship between the [[medial epicondyle]], [[lateral epicondyle]], and the tip of the [[olecranon]] forms an isosceles triangle in flexion and a straight line in extension.
    *   **Key Clinical Point:** In supracondylar fractures, this relationship is **MAINTAINED** (unlike in [[elbow dislocation]] where it is disturbed).

### Mechanism of Injury
*   **Extension Type (95-98%):**
    *   Caused by a **fall on an outstretched hand (FOOSH)** with the elbow in hyperextension.
    *   The distal fragment is displaced **posteriorly**.
*   **Flexion Type (<5%):**
    *   Caused by a direct blow to the posterior aspect of the flexed elbow.
    *   The distal fragment is displaced **anteriorly**.

### Classification (Gartland Classification)
This is used specifically for **Extension type** fractures.

| Type | Description | Treatment Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type I** | **Undisplaced** fracture. Anterior and posterior cortices are intact. | Conservative (Posterior slab/cast) |
| **Type II** | **Displaced** fracture but **posterior cortex is intact** (hinge intact). | Closed reduction + immobilization or K-wire fixation |
| **Type III** | **Completely displaced** (no cortical contact). Highly unstable. | Closed Reduction + Percutaneous Pinning (CRPP) |

*Note: Some classifications include Type IV (instability in both flexion and extension due to periosteal disruption).*

---

### Clinical Features
*   **History:** History of fall, followed by pain and inability to move the elbow.
*   **Swelling:** Usually rapid and massive.
*   **Deformity:**
    *   **S-shaped deformity** visible from the side.
    *   **Dimple Sign / Pucker Sign:** Puckering of the skin anteriorly caused by the proximal fragment spiking the subcutaneous tissue (indicates severe displacement and potential neurovascular risk).
*   **Tenderness:** Over the supracondylar region.
*   **Neurovascular Status:** Essential to check radial pulse and capillary refill. **Pink pulseless hand** indicates vascular compromise but maintained collateral circulation.

### Imaging
**X-rays (AP and Lateral Views)** are mandatory.

1.  **Fat Pad Sign (Sail Sign):**
    *   In undisplaced fractures (Type I), the fracture line may not be visible.
    *   Elevation of the anterior and posterior fat pads due to [[hemarthrosis]] creates a lucency resembling a sail.
2.  **Anterior Humeral Line:**
    *   On a lateral view, a line drawn down the anterior shaft of the humerus should pass through the middle third of the [[capitulum]]. In extension fractures, it passes anterior to the capitulum.
3.  **Baumann’s Angle:**
    *   Angle between the long axis of the humerus and the physeal line of the lateral condyle on AP view.
    *   Normal: **70–75 degrees**.
    *   Increased angle suggests varus deformity (Cubitus varus).

### Management

#### 1. Conservative Management
*   **Indication:** Type I (Undisplaced) fractures.
*   **Method:** Posterior plaster slab or cast with the elbow flexed to **90 degrees** and forearm in mid-pronation.
*   **Duration:** 3 weeks.

#### 2. Operative Management
*   **Indication:** Displaced (Type II and III), open fractures, or neurovascular compromise.
*   **Closed Reduction and Percutaneous Pinning (CRPP):**
    *   **Standard of Care.**
    *   Reduction achieved by traction and manipulation (correction of tilt, shift, and rotation).
    *   Stabilized using **K-wires** (usually crossed wires or two lateral divergent wires) under C-arm guidance.
*   **Open Reduction:**
    *   Indicated if closed reduction fails, open fractures, or vascular injury requiring repair.

#### 3. Traction
*   **Dunlop traction** or **Overhead olecranon traction** (Smith's traction) is rarely used now, mostly for cases with massive swelling where surgery is delayed or unsafe.

### Complications

#### A. Immediate (Neurovascular)
1.  **Vascular Injury:**
    *   The [[brachial artery]] is vulnerable to injury by the sharp anterior spike of the proximal fragment.
    *   Incidence: 0.5–1%.
    *   Management of **Pink Pulseless Hand**: Emergent reduction of the fracture usually restores the pulse. If the hand is white and pulseless, exploration is needed.
2.  **Nerve Injury (Neuropraxia):**
    *   **Anterior Interosseous Nerve (AIN):** Most commonly injured in **Extension type** (tested by "OK" sign/flexion of IP joint of thumb and DIP of index finger).
    *   **Radial Nerve:** Second most common in extension type.
    *   **Ulnar Nerve:** Most commonly injured in **Flexion type** or iatrogenically during medial pinning.

#### B. Early
1.  **Volkmann’s Ischemia (Compartment Syndrome):**
    *   Caused by obstruction of venous return, arterial injury, or tight plaster.
    *   **Clinical Signs (5 P's):**
        1.  **P**ain (Pain on passive stretch of fingers is the **earliest and most reliable sign**).
        2.  **P**allor.
        3.  **P**aresthesia.
        4.  **P**aralysis.
        5.  **P**ulselessness (Late sign).
    *   **Treatment:** Immediate removal of splints/bandages. If no improvement, **Fasciotomy**.

#### C. Late
1.  **Malunion (Cubitus Varus / Gunstock Deformity):**
    *   **Most common late complication.**
    *   **Cause:** Malunion due to medial tilt and internal rotation of the distal fragment. It is *not* usually due to growth plate arrest.
    *   **Clinical:** Cosmetic deformity; carrying angle is reversed. Elbow function is usually normal.
    *   **Treatment:** **Modified French Osteotomy** (Lateral closing wedge osteotomy) is done for cosmetic correction.
2.  **Myositis Ossificans:**
    *   Heterotopic bone formation in muscles (commonly [[brachialis]]).
    *   Caused by vigorous massage or passive stretching during rehabilitation.
    *   **Result:** Stiffness.

### Mnemonics
*   ** Nerve Injury Order (Extension Type):** **ARM**
    *   **A** - Anterior Interosseous Nerve (Most common)
    *   **R** - Radial Nerve
    *   **M** - Median Nerve
*   **Signs of Compartment Syndrome:** **5 P's** (Pain, Pallor, Paresthesia, Paralysis, Pulselessness).
