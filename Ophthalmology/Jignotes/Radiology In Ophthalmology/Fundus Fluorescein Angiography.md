# Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA)

**Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA)** is a diagnostic procedure used to examine the circulation of the [[retina]] and [[choroid]] using a fluorescent dye and a specialized camera. It is the gold standard for evaluating retinal vascular diseases.

### Principle
FFA is based on the principle of **fluorescence** (luminescence), where a substance absorbs light of a shorter wavelength and emits light of a longer wavelength.
*   **Dye used:** [[Sodium Fluorescein]] (orange-red dye).
*   **Excitation:** The fundus camera projects **blue light** (wavelength **465-490 nm**) through an **excitation filter**.
*   **Emission:** The dye absorbs blue light and emits **yellow-green light** (wavelength **520-530 nm**).
*   **Capture:** A **barrier filter** blocks the reflected blue light, allowing only the emitted yellow-green light to pass to the camera/film.

### Properties of Sodium Fluorescein Dye
*   **Chemical nature:** Hydrocarbon (C20H12O5Na), molecular weight 376 Daltons.
*   **Binding:** 80% binds to plasma proteins (albumin); 20% remains free.
*   **Permeability:**
    *   **Choroid:** Free dye passes easily through fenestrated choriocapillaries.
    *   **Retina:** Dye *cannot* pass through the tight junctions of retinal endothelial cells (Inner [[blood-retinal barrier]]) or the zonula occludens of the [[retinal pigment epithelium]] (Outer blood-retinal barrier).
*   **Excretion:** Metabolized by the liver and excreted by kidneys (urine turns yellowish-orange for 24-36 hours).

### Procedure
1.  **Preparation:** Pupil dilation (mydriasis).
2.  **Dosage:** 
    *   Adults: **5 ml of 10%** or **3 ml of 25%** solution.
    *   Children: 7.5 mg/kg body weight.
3.  **Injection:** Bolus injection into the **antecubital vein**.
4.  **Photography:** Serial photographs are taken immediately.
    *   Start: 5–10 seconds after injection.
    *   Frequency: Every second for 20 seconds, then every 3–5 seconds for 1 minute.
    *   Late phase: Images taken at 10 minutes (to check for staining/pooling).

### Phases of a Normal Angiogram
The **arm-to-retina circulation time** is typically **10–15 seconds**.

| Phase | Time (approx.) | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Pre-arterial (Choroidal)** | 10–12 sec | Patchy filling of the choroid (choroidal blush). [[Cilioretinal artery]] (if present) fills during this phase. |
| **2. Arterial** | 1–2 sec later | Retinal arteries fill. |
| **3. Arteriovenous (Capillary)** | -- | Complete filling of arteries and capillaries. Early filling of veins showing **Laminar flow** (dye flows along the vessel walls while the center remains dark). |
| **4. Venous** | -- | Complete filling of veins (Laminar flow disappears). |
| **5. Late (Recirculation)** | 5–10 min | Dye intensity decreases; scleral staining or pathology (leakage) becomes prominent. The [[optic disc]] margins may stain normally. |

*   **Note:** The [[foveal avascular zone]] (FAZ) appears dark throughout because it lacks blood vessels and blockage by xanthophyll pigment.

### Interpretation of Abnormalities

Abnormalities are classified as either **Hyperfluorescence** (increased brightness) or **Hypofluorescence** (decreased brightness).

#### 1. Hyperfluorescence (Too much light)
Causes include:
*   **Leakage:** Dye leaking from incompetent vessels into tissue spaces. The area of hyperfluorescence **increases in size** and intensity over time.
    *   *Examples:* [[Cystoid macular edema]] (CME), [[Diabetic retinopathy]], Neovascularization (NVD/NVE), [[Choroiditis]].
*   **Pooling:** Dye accumulation in a fluid-filled space (sub-retinal or sub-RPE).
    *   *Examples:* [[Central serous chorioretinopathy]] (CSCR), Pigment epithelial detachment (PED).
*   **Staining:** Dye retention in tissue without leakage. Intensity increases but **size remains constant**.
    *   *Examples:* [[Drusen]], Scars, Sclera.
*   **Window Defect (Transmission Defect):** Atrophy of the [[retinal pigment epithelium]] (RPE) allows choroidal fluorescence to be seen clearly. Early hyperfluorescence that fades (does not leak).
    *   *Examples:* Atrophic [[age-related macular degeneration]], Full thickness [[macular hole]].
*   **Abnormal Vasculature:** 
    *   *Examples:* Microaneurysms, Telangiectasia, Tumor vessels ([[Retinoblastoma]], [[Choroidal melanoma]] - "double circulation").

#### 2. Hypofluorescence (Too little light)
Causes include:
*   **Blocked Fluorescence (Masking):** Opacities blocking the view of underlying fluorescence.
    *   *Anterior to retina:* [[Vitreous hemorrhage]], Cataract.
    *   *Retinal:* Intra-retinal hemorrhages, Hard exudates.
    *   *Sub-retinal:* Sub-retinal hemorrhage/fluid.
*   **Vascular Filling Defect (Non-perfusion):** Absence of blood flow.
    *   *Examples:* [[Central retinal artery occlusion]] (CRAO), Capillary fallout areas in [[Diabetic retinopathy]], Ischemic [[Central retinal vein occlusion]] (CRVO).

### Classic Clinical Patterns on FFA

| Condition | Classic FFA Pattern | Clinical Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Cystoid macular edema]]** | **Flower petal appearance** | Leakage in outer plexiform layer (Henle's layer). |
| **[[Central serous chorioretinopathy]]** | **Ink-blot** or **Smoke-stack appearance** | Dye leaking from a pinpoint RPE defect into subretinal space. (Ink blot is more common; Smoke-stack is classic). |
| **[[Diabetic retinopathy]]** | Microaneurysms (hyper dots), Capillary non-perfusion (dark areas), Leakage from NVE/NVD | Critical for classifying into Proliferative vs Non-Proliferative and guiding laser therapy. |
| **[[Stargardt's disease]]** | **Dark choroid (Silent choroid)** | Blockage of choroidal flush by lipofuscin accumulation in RPE. |
| **[[Choroidal neovascular membrane]]** | Lacy hyperfluorescence | Seen in wet ARMD; leakage increases in late phases. |
| **[[Ischemic CRVO]]** | Extensive capillary non-perfusion (>10 disc areas) | High risk for neovascular glaucoma. |
| **[[Macular hole]]** | Window defect (Hyperfluorescence) | Due to loss of xanthophyll pigment and RPE atrophy. |

### Side Effects and Complications
*   **Common:** Yellowish discoloration of skin and urine (lasts 24–36 hours), nausea, vomiting (transient).
*   **Moderate:** Urticaria, syncope, thrombophlebitis at injection site, tissue necrosis if dye extravasates.
*   **Severe:** Anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, cardiac arrest (Rare: 1 in 200,000).
    *   **Emergency Kit:** Must be available (Epinephrine, Steroids, Antihistamines, Oxygen).

### Contraindications
*   History of severe reaction to fluorescein.
*   First trimester of pregnancy (relative).
*   Renal failure (relative – dye is excreted via kidneys).

### Clinical Implications
*   **Differentiation:** Distinguishes between Ischemic and Non-Ischemic [[CRVO]] (crucial for prognosis).
*   **Guidance:** Maps areas for Laser Photocoagulation in [[Diabetic retinopathy]] and [[CNVM]].
*   **Diagnosis:** Essential for diagnosing [[Central serous chorioretinopathy]], [[Cystoid macular edema]], and inflammatory conditions like [[Posterior uveitis]].
