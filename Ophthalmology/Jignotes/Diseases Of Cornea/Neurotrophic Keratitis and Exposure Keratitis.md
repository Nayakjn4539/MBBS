# [[Diseases Of Cornea]] > Neurotrophic Keratitis and Exposure Keratitis

# Neurotrophic Keratitis (Neurotrophic Keratopathy)

**Definition**: A degenerative disease of the corneal epithelium and stroma resulting from the loss of corneal sensation due to damage to the sensory nerve supply (impaired innervation of the [[Trigeminal Nerve]]). This leads to a reduction in metabolic activity, edema, and exfoliation of epithelial cells.

### Etiology
**A. Congenital Causes:**
*   **Familial Dysautonomia (Riley-Day Syndrome):** A rare genetic disorder affecting the autonomic nervous system.
*   **Congenital Insensitivity to Pain.**
*   **Anhidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia.**

**B. Acquired Causes:**
*   **Infections:**
    *   **Herpes Simplex Keratitis:** Often termed **Metaherpetic Keratitis** or trophic ulcer; not due to active viral replication but due to denervation.
    *   **Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus (HZO):** Acute infection of the Gasserian ganglion.
    *   **Leprosy:** Involvement of corneal nerves.
*   **Systemic Metabolic Disorders:** [[Diabetes Mellitus]] (Diabetic neuropathy).
*   **Trauma/Surgery:**
    *   Sectioning of the sensory root of the [[Trigeminal nerve]] for neuralgia.
    *   Alcohol block or electrocoagulation of the [[Gasserian ganglion]].
*   **Neoplasms:** Tumors pressing on the Gasserian ganglion or acoustic neuroma.

### Pathogenesis
The loss of sensory innervation leads to:
1.  **Metabolic Disturbance:** Disturbance in the metabolic activity of epithelial cells leading to accumulation of metabolites.
2.  **Edema:** Intracellular edema occurs.
3.  **Exfoliation:** Epithelial cells desquamate and are thrown off.
4.  **Ulceration:** Loss of epithelial integrity allows entry of organisms, leading to ulceration.

### Clinical Features
**Characteristic Presentation:** **"Marked signs with minimal symptoms."**

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Red eye and defective vision.
    *   **No Pain:** Absence of pain and lacrimation is the characteristic feature due to anesthesia.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Corneal Sensation:** Diminished or completely absent (Anesthetic cornea).
    *   **Ciliary Congestion:** Marked.
    *   **Corneal Appearance:** Loss of luster (dull sheen).
    *   **Epithelial Defects:** Starts as punctate epithelial erosions (PEEs) in the interpalpebral area.
    *   **Ulcer Morphology:**
        *   Typically a **large, horizontally oval ulcer**.
        *   Usually located in the **lower half** of the cornea.
        *   Margins are grey and heaped-up (thickened epithelium).
        *   May progress to stromal clouding and hypopyon if secondary infection occurs.

### Management
The goal is to protect the cornea and promote healing, as the natural protective mechanism is lost.

*   **Medical Management:**
    *   **Lubrication:** Frequent artificial tears and ointments.
    *   **Antibiotics:** To prevent secondary infection.
    *   **Cycloplegics:** To relieve ciliary spasm if uveitis is present.
    *   **Specific Therapies:** Topical nerve growth factor (NGF) drops and autologous serum drops.
    *   **Bandage Contact Lens:** To protect the epithelium.
*   **Surgical Management:**
    *   **[[Tarsorrhaphy]]:** (Lateral or median) is often required to promote healing and prevent relapses. It should be maintained for at least one year.
    *   **[[Amniotic Membrane Transplantation]] (AMT):** For large non-healing ulcers.
    *   **Conjunctival Flap:** To cover the cornea.

# Exposure Keratitis (Keratitis Lagophthalmos)

**Definition:** Corneal inflammation caused by the improper wetting of the corneal surface due to the inability of the eyelids to close completely ([[Lagophthalmos]]) or infrequent blinking.

### Etiology (Causes of Lagophthalmos)
*   **Neuroparalytic:** [[Facial Nerve]] palsy (Bell's palsy) leading to paralysis of the [[Orbicularis Oculi]] muscle.
*   **Mechanical:**
    *   Extreme [[Proptosis]] (e.g., Exophthalmic ophthalmoplegia, orbital tumor).
    *   Severe [[Ectropion]].
    *   [[Symblepharon]].
    *   Scarring of eyelids.
*   **Physiological:** Nocturnal lagophthalmos (sleeping with eyes partially open).
*   **Coma:** Deep coma patients lose the reflex blinking mechanism.

### Pathogenesis
1.  **Drying:** Inadequate closure leads to evaporation of the pre-corneal tear film.
2.  **Desiccation:** The corneal epithelium becomes desiccated and hazy.
3.  **Exfoliation:** The dry epithelium is cast off.
4.  **Infection:** The breached surface is invaded by infective organisms.

### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:** Ocular irritation, burning, foreign body sensation, and redness. Symptoms are typically **worse in the morning** (due to nocturnal exposure).
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Location:** Affects the **lower one-third** of the cornea or a horizontal band in the palpebral fissure (the area most exposed).
    *   **Lesions:** Punctate epithelial defects (SPKs) initially.
    *   **Progression:** May progress to frank ulceration, neovascularization, and perforation if neglected.
    *   **Bell's Phenomenon:** If Bell's phenomenon (upward rolling of the eye on closure) is poor, the risk of keratitis is higher.

### Management
**A. Prophylaxis (Preventive):**
*   **Lubrication:** Frequent artificial tears during the day and antibiotic ointment at night.
*   **Mechanical Protection:**
    *   **Taping:** Taping the eyelids shut during sleep.
    *   **Bandage Soft Contact Lens:** For moderate exposure.
    *   **Moisture Chamber:** Covering the eye with a glass shell or shield.

**B. Curative Treatment (Once Ulcer Develops):**
*   Treat as a standard bacterial corneal ulcer (Antibiotics, Cycloplegics).
*   **[[Tarsorrhaphy]]:** (Temporary or Permanent). This is the treatment of choice if recovery of nerve function is delayed or impossible, or if Bell's phenomenon is poor. It narrows the palpebral fissure to protect the cornea.

**C. Surgical Correction of Cause:**
*   Orbital decompression for proptosis.
*   Correction of ectropion or lid deformities.
*   Gold weight implantation in the upper lid (for facial palsy) to assist closure.

### Comparison: Neurotrophic vs. Exposure Keratitis

| Feature | Neurotrophic Keratitis | Exposure Keratitis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Defect** | **Sensory** (CN V / Trigeminal Nerve) | **Motor** (CN VII / Facial Nerve) or Mechanical |
| **Pathogenesis** | Metabolic disturbance $\rightarrow$ Exfoliation | Drying/Desiccation $\rightarrow$ Exfoliation |
| **Pain** | **Absent** (Anesthetic Cornea) | Present (Irritation, Burning) |
| **Corneal Sensation** | Lost/Diminished | Usually Intact (unless associated with V nerve damage) |
| **Location of Ulcer** | Usually Central / Lower half | **Inferior 1/3rd** (Exposed area) |
| **Key Sign** | Oval ulcer, dull sheen, heaped margins | Lagophthalmos (inability to close lids) |
| **Specific Rx** | Tarsorrhaphy, Neuro-growth factor | Taping lids, Tarsorrhaphy, Lubricants |

### Clinical Implications
*   ** Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus:** Can cause *both* Neurotrophic keratitis (due to nasociliary nerve involvement) and Exposure keratitis (if facial nerve palsy is associated).
*   **Leprosy:** A classic cause of *both* pathologies due to involvement of CN V (sensory loss) and CN VII (lagophthalmos).
*   **Hypopyon:** In neurotrophic ulcers, a hypopyon may be present but is usually sterile unless secondary infection occurs.
