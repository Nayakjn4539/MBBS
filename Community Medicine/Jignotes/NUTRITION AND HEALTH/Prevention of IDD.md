# Prevention of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (IDD)

[[Iodine Deficiency Disorders]] (IDD) constitute a major public health problem leading to a spectrum of disabilities including goiter, hypothyroidism, impaired mental function, and cretinism. Prevention is primarily based on correcting the deficiency through nutritional intervention.

### 1. Iodized Salt (The Main Strategy)
[[Iodized Salt]] is the most widely used, most economical, convenient, and effective means of mass prophylaxis in endemic areas.

*   **Universal Salt Iodization:** The policy involves the fortification of all edible salt with iodine.
*   **Chemical Used:** In India, salt is fortified with **[[Potassium Iodate]] ($KIO_3$)** because it is more stable than potassium iodide in hot and humid climates.
*   **Recommended Levels of Iodization:**
    *   **At Production Level:** Not less than **30 ppm** (parts per million).
    *   **At Consumer Level:** Not less than **15 ppm**.
    *   *Note:* The difference allows for loss of iodine during transport and storage.
*   **Advantages of Salt as a Vehicle:**
    *   Universally consumed by all sections of the community.
    *   Consumption is relatively constant throughout the year (approx. 10-15g/adult/day).
    *   Easy to fortify and does not alter the taste, color, or smell of food.
    *   Cheap and allows for controlled intake.

### 2. Iodized Oil
This is an alternative method used for **specific target groups** (severe endemic areas) or where salt iodization is not immediately feasible. It consists of iodized poppy-seed oil.

*   **Intramuscular Injection:**
    *   **Dose:** 1 ml.
    *   **Duration of Protection:** Provides protection for about **4 years**.
    *   *Advantage:* Suitable for isolated communities; long-term protection.
*   **Oral Administration:**
    *   **Dose:** 2 ml (containing 480 mg iodine).
    *   **Duration of Protection:** Effective for **1 to 2 years**.

### 3. Double Fortified Salt (DFS)
*   Developed by the **National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad**.
*   It involves the fortification of common salt with both **[[Iron]]** and **[[Iodine]]** to combat the dual burden of anemia and IDD.
*   **Composition:** Salt + Potassium Iodate + Ferrous Sulphate + Sodium Hexametaphosphate (stabilizer).
*   **Content:** It provides **40 mcg Iodine** and **1 mg Iron** per gram of salt.

### 4. Iodine Tablets (Sodium Iodate)
*   Occasionally used for school children in specific settings but less practicable than salt iodization.

### National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Programme ([[NIDDCP]])
The prevention strategies are implemented under the NIDDCP (formerly National Goitre Control Programme launched in 1962). The core objectives are:

1.  **Surveys:** To assess the magnitude of IDD in districts.
2.  **Supply:** To ensure the supply of iodized salt in place of common salt.
3.  **Resurveys:** To assess the impact of iodized salt every 5 years.
4.  **Laboratory Monitoring:** Monitoring of iodized salt quality and [[Urinary Iodine Excretion]] (UIE).
5.  **Health Education:** Mass publicity and public awareness.

### Monitoring and Surveillance Indicators
Surveillance is crucial to ensure the program is working. The indicators are classified into Process, Impact, and Sustainability indicators.

| Type of Indicator | Parameter | Goal/Cut-off |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Process Indicator** | Households using adequately iodized salt | **> 90%** |
| **Impact Indicator** | **[[Urinary Iodine Excretion]] (UIE)** <br> *(Principal Impact Indicator)* | Proportion < 100 mcg/L should be **< 50%** <br> Proportion < 50 mcg/L should be **< 20%** |
| | **Prevalence of Goiter** (6-12 years) | **< 5%** indicates elimination as a public health problem |
| | **Neonatal [[Hypothyroidism]]** | Sensitive indicator of environmental iodine deficiency. |

**Spot Testing of Salt:**
Field workers use **Salt Testing Kits**.
*   Add test solution to salt.
*   **Color change to Purple/Blue** = Iodine present.
*   No color change = No Iodine.

### Clinical Relevance
*   **IQ Loss:** Iodine deficiency is the single most significant cause of preventable brain damage. Children in iodine-deficient areas may have an IQ **13.5 points lower** than those in sufficient areas.
*   **Pregnancy:** Adequate iodine is critical during the first trimester to prevent **Cretinism** (mental retardation, deaf-mutism, squint).
*   **Recommended Daily Intake:** Adults need **150 mcg/day**; Pregnant women need **250 mcg/day**.

### Mnemonic
To remember the **Components of IDD Prevention Strategy**: **"SALT"**

*   **S** - **S**urveillance and Surveys (Goiter rate, UIE)
*   **A** - **A**wareness (IEC activities)
*   **L** - **L**aboratory monitoring (Salt quality, Urine iodine)
*   **T** - **T**argeted Supply (Universal Iodized Salt - 30/15 ppm)
