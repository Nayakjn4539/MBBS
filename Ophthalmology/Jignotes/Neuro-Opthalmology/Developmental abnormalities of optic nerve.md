# [[Neuro-Opthalmology]] > Developmental abnormalities of optic nerve

# Normal Development of the Optic Nerve

The development of the [[optic nerve]] is a complex process closely tied to the embryogenesis of the retina and the brain.

### Key Stages of Development
1.  **Optic Stalk Formation:** The optic nerve develops within the framework of the **optic stalk**, which connects the [[optic vesicle]] to the forebrain.
2.  **Choroidal Fissure:** During the invagination of the optic vesicle to form the [[optic cup]], a groove called the [[choroidal fissure]] (or fetal fissure) forms along the inferior aspect of the optic stalk. This fissure allows the **hyaloid artery** to enter the eye.
3.  **Nerve Fiber Growth:**
    *   Nerve fibers develop from the **nerve fiber layer** of the [[retina]]. These are axons of the [[ganglion cells]] (second-order neurons).
    *   These fibers grow into the optic stalk, passing through the choroidal fissure by the **6th week** of gestation, and travel posteriorly toward the brain.
4.  **Closure of Fissure:** The choroidal fissure normally closes by the **7th week**. Failure of this closure leads to colobomatous defects.
5.  **Glial System & Sheaths:**
    *   The glial system develops from neuro-ectodermal cells forming the outer wall of the optic stalk.
    *   The meningeal sheaths (dura, arachnoid, pia) are formed from the surrounding **mesenchyme**.
6.  **Myelination:**
    *   Myelination of nerve fibers begins in the brain and progresses distally toward the eye.
    *   It reaches the [[lamina cribrosa]] **just before birth** and typically stops there.
    *   If myelination continues past the lamina cribrosa into the retina, it results in **medullated nerve fibers**.

# Congenital Anomalies of the Optic Disc

These anomalies are often detected during routine fundoscopy and must be differentiated from acquired optic neuropathies like [[papilledema]] or [[glaucoma]].

### 1. Coloboma of the Optic Disc
This results from the incomplete closure of the embryonic **choroidal fissure**.

*   **Pathogenesis:** Defective closure of the fetal fissure (usually inferiorly).
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Appearance:** A large, whitish excavation, usually decentered **inferiorly** or **inferonasally**,. The actual optic disc tissue is confined to a small superior wedge.
    *   **Visual Field Defect:** Causes a **superior visual field defect** (corresponding to the inferior defect).
    *   **Vision:** Visual acuity is often defective.
*   **Associations:**
    *   Often associated with other colobomas (iris, ciliary body, choroid).
    *   Systemic associations: **CHARGE syndrome**, **Patau syndrome (Trisomy 13)**, and **Edward's syndrome (Trisomy 18)**.

### 2. Morning Glory Disc Anomaly
A specific type of dysplastic coloboma of the optic disc.

*   **Appearance:**
    *   Large, excavated, funnel-shaped optic disc,.
    *   **Central Core:** Filled with a dot of white **glial tissue** (persistent hyaloid remnants).
    *   **Vascular Pattern:** Retinal vessels emerge from the disc rim in a **radial pattern** resembling the "spokes of a wheel",.
    *   Surrounded by a ring of peripapillary pigmentary disturbance.
*   **Laterality:** usually **unilateral**,.
*   **Vision:** Visual acuity is usually very poor.
*   **Clinical Implication:** It is associated with **transsphenoidal basal encephalocele**. Neuroimaging (MRI) is recommended.

### 3. Optic Nerve Hypoplasia (ONH)
A condition where the optic nerve has a reduced number of axons. It is a significant cause of blindness at birth.

*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Small Disc:** The optic disc appears abnormally small.
    *   **Double Ring Sign:** The small disc is surrounded by a yellowish mottled peripapillary halo and a pigmented rim, creating a "double ring" appearance.
    *   **Vessels:** May be tortuous.
*   **Associations:**
    *   Maternal risk factors: Alcohol use (**Fetal Alcohol Syndrome**), Diabetes, drug intake (e.g., Phenytoin, Quinine) during pregnancy,.
    *   **Septo-Optic Dysplasia (De Morsier Syndrome):** A triad of ONH, absence of septum pellucidum/corpus callosum agenesis, and pituitary hormone abnormalities (growth hormone deficiency).

### 4. Optic Disc Pit
A congenital depression in the optic disc.

*   **Appearance:** A round or oval, grey/yellowish crater-like excavation, usually situated **temporally** on the disc,.
*   **Clinical Implication:**
    *   **Serous Macular Detachment:** About 50% of cases develop serous detachment of the [[macula]] (maculopathy) due to fluid tracking from the pit into the subretinal space.
    *   Often confused with [[Central Serous Chorioretinopathy]] (CSCR).

### 5. Myelinated (Medullated) Nerve Fibers
Normally, myelination stops at the lamina cribrosa. If oligodendrocytes penetrate the lamina cribrosa, myelination extends into the retina.

*   **Appearance:**
    *   White, feathery, or flame-shaped patches with frayed margins.
    *   Usually contiguous with the optic disc margin.
    *   Retinal vessels are partially **obscured/covered** by the white patch.
*   **Visual Field:** Results in an **enlargement of the blind spot**.
*   **Prognosis:** Harmless condition; static. No visual loss usually, unless the macula is involved.
*   **Differential:** Differentiate from cotton wool spots (soft exudates) or papilledema.

### 6. Optic Disc Drusen
Hyaline-like calcific material deposited within the substance of the optic nerve head,.

*   **Pathogenesis:** Thought to be remnants of axonal transport systems of degenerated retinal ganglion cells.
*   **Appearance:**
    *   **In Children:** They are often "buried" deep in the tissue, causing elevation of the disc with blurred margins, simulating **papilledema** (**Pseudo-papilledema**).
    *   **In Adults:** They emerge to the surface as waxy, pearl-like, irregular refractile bodies.
*   **Diagnostics:**
    *   **Ultrasound (B-Scan):** Shows high reflectivity (calcification) even at low gain,.
    *   **CT Scan:** Shows calcification.
    *   **Autofluorescence:** Hyper-autofluorescent.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   May cause visual field defects (arcuate scotomas, enlarged blind spot).
    *   Associated with **Retinitis Pigmentosa** and **Angioid Streaks**.

### 7. Tilted Disc
*   **Appearance:** The disc appears oval, with the long axis obliquely oriented (usually inferonasal to superotemporal).
*   **Associations:** High [[myopia]] and situs inversus of retinal vessels,.
*   **Field Defect:** Can produce bitemporal hemianopia that does not respect the vertical midline (unlike chiasmal lesions).

### 8. Bergmeister’s Papilla
*   **Definition:** A congenital remnant of the hyaloid arterial system.
*   **Appearance:** A tuft or flake of **glial tissue** projecting from the optic disc into the vitreous.
*   **Significance:** Usually benign and asymptomatic.
