# [[Diseases Of Uveal Tract]] > Fuchs' Heterochromic Iridocyclitis

### [[Fuchs' Heterochromic Iridocyclitis]] (FHI)

**Fuchs' Heterochromic Iridocyclitis** (also known as Fuchs' Uveitis Syndrome) is a chronic, low-grade, usually unilateral, non-granulomatous [[anterior uveitis]]. It is a distinct clinical entity characterized by the triad of heterochromia, cataract, and keratic precipitates, typically without the formation of posterior synechiae.

### Epidemiology and Etiology
*   **Age:** Typically affects young adults to middle-aged persons (3rd to 4th decade).
*   **Laterality:** Predominantly **unilateral** (90% of cases).
*   **Etiology:** Largely unknown (idiopathic).
    *   One theory suggests a disturbance of the **sympathetic nerve supply** to the eye, which controls chromatophores (leading to depigmentation) and blood vessel tone.
    *   Unlike other uveitis types, it is generally **not** associated with systemic disease.

### Clinical Features

#### Symptoms
The onset is **insidious**. Patients are often asymptomatic and diagnosed during routine examination. Common complaints include:
*   **Blurring of vision:** Usually secondary to [[cataract]] formation or vitreous floaters.
*   **Change in eye color:** Heterochromia may be noticed by the patient.
*   **Absence of acute symptoms:** Typically **no pain**, redness, or photophobia ("White Uveitis").

#### Signs
**1. Cornea**
*   **Keratic Precipitates (KPs):** Pathognomonic appearance.
    *   **Fine, stellate** (star-shaped), grey-white.
    *   **Diffuse distribution:** Scattered over the *entire* corneal endothelium (Endothelial dusting), unlike the Arlt’s triangle distribution seen in other uveitis.
    *   **Non-confluent:** They never become confluent or pigmented.
    *   Fine **fibrin filaments** may be seen between KPs.

**2. Anterior Chamber**
*   **Aqueous Flare:** Faint/mild.
*   **Cells:** Few cells present.
*   **[[Amsler's Sign]]:** Filiform hemorrhage (fine, thread-like bleeding) from the angle vessels occurring spontaneously or after anterior chamber paracentesis/surgery (due to fragile vessels).

**3. Iris**
*   **[[Heterochromia Iridis]]:** The affected eye is usually **hypochromic** (lighter) due to stromal atrophy and loss of pigment.
    *   *Note:* In patients with heavily pigmented irides, stromal atrophy may reveal the darker posterior pigment epithelium, making the affected eye appear darker (inverse heterochromia), though hypochromia is the rule.
*   **Atrophy:** Diffuse stromal atrophy giving a washed-out or "moth-eaten" appearance. Loss of normal iris crypts.
*   **Nodules:** [[Koeppe nodules]] (at pupillary border) and [[Busacca nodules]] (on iris surface) may occasionally be seen.
*   **Vascularity:** [[Rubeosis Iridis]] (fine, nondescript new vessels on the iris and angle) is fairly common.
*   **Pupil:** May be slightly enlarged (mydriasis) due to sphincter atrophy.
*   **Synechiae:** **ABSENT posterior synechiae**. This is a hallmark feature. If posterior synechiae are present, the diagnosis of FHI is questionable.

**4. Lens**
*   **[[Complicated Cataract]]:** Very common. Usually **posterior subcapsular** type.

**5. Vitreous**
*   **[[Vitritis]]:** Anterior vitreous opacities/floaters are common.

### Mnemonic for Clinical Features
**"No FUCHS"**
*   **No** posterior synechiae
*   **F**loaters
*   **U**nilateral
*   **C**ataract
*   **H**eterochromia
*   **S**tellate KPs

---

### Complications
1.  **[[Cataract]]:** Develops early. Surgery generally has a good prognosis.
2.  **[[Glaucoma]]:** Usually secondary **open-angle glaucoma** caused by trabecular sclerosis or infiltration. It is a serious complication and can be difficult to manage.
3.  **Vitreous Opacities:** Persistent floaters.

---

### Diagnosis and Investigations
Diagnosis is primarily **clinical**.
*   **Slit Lamp Examination:** To identify stellate KPs, heterochromia, and absence of synechiae.
*   **[[Gonioscopy]]:** To check for angle neovascularization or fine vessels (Amsler sign) and to assess open-angle status.
*   **Laboratory Tests:** Generally not useful as it is not associated with systemic autoimmune diseases.

### Differential Diagnosis
1.  **Posner-Schlossman Syndrome (Glaucomatocyclitic Crisis):** Recurrent attacks of high IOP, unilateral, few KPs, but self-limiting and pupil is often dilated during attacks.
2.  **Herpetic Uveitis:** Can cause atrophy and high IOP, but usually has pain, history of keratitis, and sectoral iris atrophy.
3.  **Congenital Heterochromia:** No inflammation or cataract.
4.  **Horner’s Syndrome:** Ptosis, miosis, anhydrosis, and heterochromia (congenital), but no uveitis.

### Management

| Aspect | Treatment Approach |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Inflammation** | • **Topical [[Corticosteroids]]:** Often not required or used only for symptomatic exacerbations. The low-grade inflammation is often resistant to steroids and does not cause synechiae.<br>• **Cycloplegics/Mydriatics:** **NOT indicated** because posterior synechiae do not form. |
| **Cataract** | • **Surgery:** Phacoemulsification with IOL implantation. Visual prognosis is generally good. Risk of hyphema (Amsler sign) during surgery. |
| **Glaucoma** | • **Medical:** Initial management with anti-glaucoma drops (similar to [[Primary Open Angle Glaucoma]]).<br>• **Surgical:** Filtration surgery (Trabeculectomy) or drainage devices if medical therapy fails. |

**Clinical Implication:** Avoid long-term steroids in these patients as they may accelerate cataract formation or induce steroid glaucoma without significant benefit to the mild uveitis.
