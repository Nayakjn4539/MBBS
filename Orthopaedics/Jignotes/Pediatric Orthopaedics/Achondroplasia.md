### Achondroplasia

**Definition**
Achondroplasia is the most common form of **disproportionate dwarfism**. It is a disorder of bone growth that prevents the changing of cartilage to bone (chondrodystrophy).

**Etiology and Genetics**
*   **Inheritance:** [[Autosomal Dominant]] inheritance pattern,.
*   **Mutation:** Caused by a mutation in the **[[FGFR3 gene]]** (Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3) located on **Chromosome 4**.
*   **Sporadic Cases:** more than 80% of cases arise from a fresh gene mutation (sporadic) in children born to parents of average height,. 
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   There is a defect in **[[endochondral ossification]]** (bone formation from a cartilage model), which affects the longitudinal growth of long bones.
    *   **[[Intramembranous ossification]]** is normal; therefore, bones formed by this method (e.g., skull vault, clavicle) develop normally or may even be enlarged.

**Clinical Features**
The clinical presentation is classic and often diagnosed at birth. 

**1. General Appearance**
*   **Stature:** Disproportionate short stature. The trunk is of relatively normal length, but the limbs are disproportionately short. Adult height is usually around 125 cm (approx 4 feet).
*   **Intelligence:** Typically normal,.
*   **Sexual Development:** Normal.

**2. Head and Face**
*   **Macrocephaly:** Large skull with a bulging vault and [[frontal bossing]],.
*   **Face:** Saddle-shaped nose (depressed nasal bridge). Small maxilla with a prominent mandible (prognathism).

**3. Limbs**
*   **[[Rhizomelic shortening]]:** Shortening affects the proximal segments (humerus and femur) more than the distal segments,.
*   **Hands:**
    *   **Trident Hand:** The fingers are stubby. There is an inability to approximate the middle and ring fingers, creating a gap ("V" shape) between them,.
    *   **Starfish Hand:** Short, stubby fingers where all fingers appear to be of the same length,.
*   **Elbows:** Inability to fully extend the elbows.

**4. Spine and Posture**
*   **Postural changes:** When standing, the patient exhibits increased **[[lumbar lordosis]]**.
*   **Buttocks:** Prominent buttocks due to pelvic tilt.
*   **Gibbus:** In infancy, a **thoracolumbar gibbus** may be present, which usually disappears as the child starts walking.

**Radiological Features**
Imaging is diagnostic and reveals characteristic skeletal dysplasia.

| Region | Radiological Findings |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Spine** | • **Bullet-nosed vertebrae** (anterior beaking).<br>• Narrowing of the **interpedicular distance** in the lumbar spine (normally widens caudally) leading to a narrow spinal canal.<br>• Shortened vertebral pedicles. |
| **Pelvis** | • **Champagne glass pelvis**: The pelvic cavity is small and broad,.<br>• **Squared iliac wings** ("Elephant ear" appearance) with horizontal acetabular roofs. |
| **Long Bones** | • Bones are short but thick.<br>• Metaphyses are wide and flared (trumpet-shaped).<br>• Fibula may be longer than the tibia. |
| **Skull** | • Large calvarium with a small skull base. |

**Differential Diagnosis**
It is important to distinguish Achondroplasia from other forms of dwarfism:
1.  **[[Morquio’s disease]] (Mucopolysaccharidosis IV):** Shortening affects the distal segments more than the proximal; associated with corneal clouding and specific urinary mucopolysaccharides.
2.  **Epiphyseal dysplasias:** The head and face are usually normal; radiological changes are concentrated in the epiphyses.
3.  **[[Hypochondroplasia]]:** A milder form of achondroplasia with less obvious features.

**Complications**
*   **Neurological:**
    *   **[[Spinal Stenosis]]:** Due to short pedicles and narrow spinal canal, leading to nerve root compression or claudication in adulthood,.
    *   **Hydrocephalus:** Occasionally seen due to skull base abnormalities.
*   **Orthopaedic:**
    *   Genu varum (Bow legs).
    *   Recurrent ear infections (due to cranial anatomy).

**Management**
There is no cure for the genetic defect. Management is multidisciplinary.

*   **Non-Operative:**
    *   Psychological support and genetic counselling.
    *   Monitoring for spinal stenosis and neurological deficits.
*   **Operative:**
    *   **[[Limb Lengthening]]:** Ilizarov technique or rail fixators can be used to increase height, though this is a lengthy and complex process requiring multiple surgeries.
    *   **Decompression:** Laminectomy may be required for severe lumbar spinal stenosis causing neurological symptoms.
    *   **Osteotomy:** To correct severe bow-leg deformities.

**Clinical Implications**
*   **Anesthesia:** Care must be taken during intubation due to cervical spine instability or skull base anomalies. Regional anesthesia (epidural/spinal) may be technically difficult due to spinal stenosis and vertebral anomalies.
*   **Obstetrics:** Women with achondroplasia almost always require **Caesarean section** for childbirth due to the small pelvic outlet (Champagne glass pelvis).
