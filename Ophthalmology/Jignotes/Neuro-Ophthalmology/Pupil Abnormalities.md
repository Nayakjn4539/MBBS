# Pupil Abnormalities: Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD)

## Introduction: The Marcus Gunn Pupil
**Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD)**, classically known as the **[[Marcus Gunn Pupil]]**, is a critical objective sign in neuro-ophthalmology. It indicates an asymmetrical defect in the afferent pathway of the [[Pupillary Light Reflex]] (PLR), typically localized to the **[[Optic Nerve]]** or extensive retinal pathology. It is considered the earliest indication of optic nerve disease, even when visual acuity appears normal.

### Pathophysiology
The PLR pathway involves the optic nerve (afferent) transmitting signals to the midbrain ([[Pretectal Nucleus]] and **[[Edinger-Westphal Nucleus]]**), which then sends efferent signals via the **[[Oculomotor Nerve]]** (CN III) to the sphincter pupillae to constrict the pupil.
*   In RAPD, there is a **conduction defect** in the optic nerve of the affected eye.
*   The brain perceives light shone into the affected eye as "dimmer" compared to the healthy eye.
*   Consequently, the drive to constrict the pupil is weaker when stimulating the affected eye compared to the healthy eye.

## Clinical Examination: The Swinging Flashlight Test
The gold standard for detecting RAPD is the **Swinging Flashlight Test**. It compares the direct and consensual pupillary responses between the two eyes.

**Prerequisites:**
*   Performed in a semi-dark room.
*   Patient fixes gaze on a distant object (to prevent accommodation-induced miosis).
*   Bright light source used.

**Procedure and Interpretation:**

| Step | Action | Normal Physiological Response | Findings in Left RAPD (Left Optic Nerve Lesion) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Shine light on the **Right (Normal)** eye. | Right pupil constricts (Direct). Left pupil constricts (Consensual). | Right pupil constricts (Direct). Left pupil constricts (Consensual). |
| **2** | Swing light quickly to the **Left (Affected)** eye. | Left pupil constricts/stays constricted (Direct). Right pupil constricts/stays constricted (Consensual). | **Paradoxical Dilatation:** Both pupils dilate. |
| **3** | Swing light back to the **Right (Normal)** eye. | Both pupils constrict again. | Both pupils constrict again. |

**Mechanism of Paradoxical Dilatation:**
When the light is moved from the normal eye to the affected eye, the afferent impulse strength drops significantly due to the lesion. The brain interprets this as a reduction in light intensity. Consequently, the pupils dilate to their "resting" state relative to the weak stimulus, appearing to dilate in the presence of light.

### Grading of RAPD
While often noted simply as present or absent, it can be quantified using **[[Neutral Density Filters]]**. Filters of increasing density are placed over the normal eye until the pupillary response is balanced (no RAPD is noted). The density of the filter required represents the magnitude of the defect (measured in log units).

## Etiology of RAPD
RAPD is caused by **unilateral** or **asymmetric** disease. Symmetrical bilateral disease does not produce an RAPD.

### 1. Optic Nerve Causes (Most Common)
*   **[[Optic Neuritis]]** (e.g., Multiple Sclerosis): RAPD is a hallmark sign.
*   **[[Ischemic Optic Neuropathy]]**:
    *   **[[AION]]** (Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy).
    *   **Traumatic Optic Neuropathy**.
*   **Compressive Optic Neuropathy:** Tumors (e.g., Glioma, Meningioma) compressing the nerve.
*   **Glaucoma:** Only if there is significant asymmetry between the two eyes.
*   **Asymmetric Optic Atrophy**.

### 2. Retinal Causes (Severe Disease Required)
*   **[[Central Retinal Artery Occlusion]] (CRAO):** Sudden, profound loss of afferent input.
*   **[[Central Retinal Vein Occlusion]] (Ischemic CRVO):** Presence of RAPD distinguishes **Ischemic** from Non-Ischemic CRVO.
*   **Extensive [[Retinal Detachment]]**: Macula-off or large detachments.
*   **Severe Macular Disease:** Rarely causes RAPD unless extremely extensive (e.g., large macular scar/hole is unlikely to cause it, but extensive destruction might).

### 3. Other Causes
*   **[[Optic Tract]] Lesion:** Can cause a contralateral RAPD (due to hemianopic fibers arrangement) – see Wernicke's Pupil below.

> **Clinical Pearl:** **Dense Cataracts**, **Vitreous Hemorrhage**, and **Refractive Errors** generally **DO NOT** cause an RAPD. If an RAPD is present in a patient with a cataract, look for underlying optic nerve or retinal pathology.

## Differential Diagnosis

### 1. Absolute Afferent Pupillary Defect (Amaurotic Pupil)
This occurs in a **completely blind eye** (No Perception of Light - PL negative) due to total optic nerve severance or destruction.

*   **Light on Blind Eye:** Neither pupil constricts.
*   **Light on Normal Eye:** Both pupils constrict (Normal direct and consensual).
*   **Near Reflex:** Present in both eyes (pupils constrict on accommodation).

### 2. Wernicke's Hemianopic Pupil
Seen in **[[Optic Tract]] lesions**.
*   Light stimulation of the blind hemiretina (e.g., temporal retina of affected side) causes *no* constriction.
*   Light stimulation of the seeing hemiretina causes constriction.
*   *Note:* Difficult to elicit clinically without a slit lamp due to light scatter.

### 3. Efferent Pathway Defects
Lesions of the **[[Oculomotor Nerve]]** (CN III) or iris sphincter muscle (e.g., trauma, pharmacological mydriasis).
*   **Anisocoria** (unequal pupil size) is the hallmark (RAPD does *not* cause anisocoria).
*   The affected pupil does not constrict to light (direct or consensual), but the *other* eye will constrict when light is shown in the affected eye (intact afferent, broken efferent).

### Comparison Table: Pupil Abnormalities

| Condition | Lesion Site | Pupil Size (Ambient) | Direct Light Reflex (Affected Eye) | Consensual Light Reflex (in Normal Eye) | Near Reflex |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RAPD (Marcus Gunn)** | Incomplete Optic Nerve | Equal (Isocoria) | Weak/Dilation (Paradoxical) | Weak/Dilation | Normal |
| **Amaurotic Pupil** | Complete Optic Nerve | Equal (Isocoria) | Absent | Absent | Normal |
| **Adie's Tonic Pupil** | Ciliary Ganglion | Anisocoria (Affected > Normal) | Absent/Sluggish | Normal | Slow/Tonic |
| **Argyll Robertson** | Tectum/Pretectal | Miosis (Small, irregular) | Absent | Absent | Present |
