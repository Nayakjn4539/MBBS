# Anisometropia

### Definition
[[Anisometropia]] is an optical condition wherein the total refractive power of the two eyes is unequal.
*   **Isometropia**: A state where the refraction of the two eyes is equal.
*   **Clinically Significant Anisometropia**: A difference of **> 1 Dioptre (D)** is generally considered significant, though patients may tolerate up to 2.5 D.
*   **Implication**: A difference of **1 D** in refractive error between the two eyes causes approximately **2% difference** in the size of the two retinal images [[Aniseikonia]]. A difference of 5% in retinal images (approx. 2.5 D to 4 D anisometropia) is the maximum tolerated by the fusion mechanism [[Binocular Single Vision]].

### Etiology
1.  **Congenital/Developmental**: Due to differential growth of the two eyeballs (axial length or corneal curvature).
2.  **Acquired**:
    *   Uniocular [[Aphakia]] (removal of cataractous lens).
    *   Implantation of [[Intraocular Lens]] (IOL) of incorrect power.
    *   Asymmetric age-related changes (e.g., [[Nuclear Sclerosis]]).
    *   Trauma causing corneal scarring or lens subluxation.
    *   Refractive surgery (LASIK/PRK) resulting in under/overcorrection in one eye.

### Clinical Types
Anisometropia is classified based on the refractive status of the two eyes:

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Simple Anisometropia** | One eye is [[Emmetropia]] (normal) and the other is [[Ametropia]] (Myopic or Hypermetropic). |
| **Compound Anisometropia** | Both eyes are either hypermetropic or myopic, but one eye has a higher refractive error than the other. |
| **Mixed Anisometropia** | One eye is myopic and the other is hypermetropic. Also known as **[[Antimetropia]]**. |
| **Simple Astigmatic Anisometropia** | One eye is normal, the other has simple myopic or hypermetropic [[Astigmatism]]. |
| **Compound Astigmatic Anisometropia** | Both eyes have astigmatism but of unequal degree. |

### Status of Binocular Vision
The impact on [[Binocular Vision]] depends on the degree of anisometropia:
1.  **Binocular Single Vision (BSV)**: Maintained in small degrees of anisometropia (< 3 D).
2.  **Uniocular Vision**: When the refractive error in one eye is high, the brain suppresses the image from that eye to avoid diplopia, leading to **[[Anisometropic Amblyopia]]**. This is more common in hypermetropes than myopes.
    *   *Clinical Implication:* [[Hypermetropia]] of > 3.5 D difference or [[Myopia]] of > 6.5 D difference carries almost 100% risk of amblyopia.
3.  **Alternate Vision**: Seen in **Antimetropia** (Mixed Anisometropia). The patient uses the hypermetropic eye for distance vision and the myopic eye for near vision. These patients are often comfortable and rarely have asthenopia.

### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms**:
    *   [[Asthenopia]] (Eye strain).
    *   **Diplopia**: Occurs if the fusion mechanism breaks down (decompensated heterophoria).
    *   Difficulty in depth perception.
    *   Strabismus (Squint): Due to loss of fusion.
*   **Signs**:
    *   Difference in refractive error on [[Retinoscopy]] or [[Autorefractometry]].
    *   Presence of [[Amblyopia]] in the eye with higher error (especially hypermetropia).

### Treatment
**1. Spectacles**
*   Correction is tolerated well up to a maximum difference of **4 D**. Beyond this, [[Diplopia]] or strain occurs due to aniseikonia.
*   **Children**: Full correction of anisometropia is mandated to prevent [[Amblyopia]].
*   **Adults**: Ideally, under-correct the more ametropic eye to a level that is comfortable (balance comfort vs. clarity).
*   **Knapp’s Law**: Spectacles placed at the anterior focal point of the eye (approx. 15mm in front of the cornea) create retinal images of the same size as an emmetropic eye in axial ametropia. However, practically this is difficult to apply due to vertex distance limitations.

**2. Contact Lenses**
*   **Treatment of choice** for higher degrees of anisometropia.
*   They minimize [[Aniseikonia]] because the vertex distance is negligible (lens rests on the cornea), reducing image magnification/minification differences.

**3. Aniseikonic Glasses**
*   Special lenses designed to alter magnification without changing refractive power (rarely used now).

**4. Surgical Modalities**
*   **Refractive Surgery**: [[LASIK]], [[PRK]] for unilateral high myopia/astigmatism.
*   **Intraocular Lens (IOL)**: For uniocular aphakia.
*   **Phakic IOL / Refractive Lens Exchange**: For very high degrees of anisometropia.

**5. Amblyopia Therapy**
*   [[Occlusion Therapy]] (Patching) or Penalization if amblyopia has already set in (primarily for children).

# Aniseikonia

### Definition
[[Aniseikonia]] is a condition wherein the images projected to the [[Visual Cortex]] from the two retinae are abnormally unequal in **size** and/or **shape**.

### Etiology
1.  **Optical Aniseikonia**: Due to high [[Anisometropia]].
2.  **Retinal Aniseikonia**: Displacement of retinal elements (e.g., stretching in high myopia, edema, macular hole).
3.  **Cortical Aniseikonia**: Asymmetrical simultaneous perception despite equal retinal images.

### Magnification Rule
*   For every **1 Dioptre** of anisometropia corrected by spectacles, there is approximately **2% image magnification/minification difference**.
*   **Tolerance**: The neurological system can generally tolerate up to **5%** difference (approx. 2.5 D anisometropia).

### Clinical Types
> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> shapes of images in different types of aniseikonia

1.  **Symmetrical Aniseikonia**:
    *   **Spherical**: Image magnified/minified equally in all meridians.
    *   **Cylindrical**: Image magnified/minified symmetrically in one meridian (seen in [[Astigmatism]]).
2.  **Asymmetrical Aniseikonia**:
    *   **Prismatic**: Image difference increases progressively in one direction.
    *   **Pincushion Distortion**: Distortion increases progressively in both directions. Seen with high **Plus** (Convex) correction (e.g., Aphakia).
    *   **Barrel Distortion**: Distortion decreases progressively in both directions. Seen with high **Minus** (Concave) correction (e.g., High Myopia).

> **Mnemonic for Distortion:**
> *   **P**lus lenses cause **P**incushion.
> *   **M**inus lenses cause **M**ini-Barrel.

### Symptoms
*   [[Asthenopia]] (Eye ache, headache).
*   **Photophobia**.
*   Difficulty in depth perception (clumsiness, bumping into objects).
*   **Diplopia** (if the difference is >5%).
*   Distortion of objects (floor appears tilted).

### Testing
*   **Space Eikonometer**: The standard instrument to measure the degree of aniseikonia.

### Treatment
1.  **Contact Lenses**: Best optical solution as they reduce magnification/minification effects.
2.  **Iseikonic Lenses**: Spectacle lenses with modified thickness and base curves to adjust magnification (rarely prescribed).
3.  **Intraocular Lenses**: Implanting an IOL (pseudophakia) eliminates the optical anisometropia caused by aphakia.
