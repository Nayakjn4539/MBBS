# [[NUTRITION AND HEALTH]] > What is a balanced diet? Enumerate different nutritional problems prevalent in India. How primary prevention plays an important role in prevention of protein energy undernutrition?

### Balanced Diet

A [[Balanced Diet]] is defined as a diet which contains a variety of foods in such quantities and proportions that the need for **energy, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, fats, carbohydrates** and other nutrients is adequately met for maintaining health, vitality, and general well-being.

**Key Features:**
*   It meets the nutritional requirements based on age, sex, and physical activity.
*   It includes a **small provision (safety margin)** for extra nutrients to withstand short durations of leanness or physiological stress.

**Composition of a Balanced Diet (Energy Distribution):**

| Nutrient | Recommended % of Total Daily Energy Intake |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Proteins** | 10 – 15% |
| **Fats** | 15 – 30% |
| **Carbohydrates** | 50 – 70% (Rich in natural fiber) |

### Nutritional Problems Prevalent in India

India faces a "dual burden" of malnutrition—undernutrition and overnutrition. The major nutritional problems of public health importance are:

**1. [[Protein Energy Malnutrition]] (PEM):**
*   This is the most widespread form of malnutrition among pre-school children.
*   It manifests as **Marasmus** (energy deficiency) and **Kwashiorkor** (protein deficiency).
*   Sub-clinical forms like **stunting** (low height for age), **wasting** (low weight for height), and **underweight** are highly prevalent.

**2. [[Low Birth Weight]] (LBW):**
*   Defined as birth weight less than 2.5 kg.
*   A major public health problem (approx. 28% incidence) attributed to maternal malnutrition and anemia.

**3. [[Nutritional Anaemia]]:**
*   Mostly **Iron Deficiency Anaemia**.
*   Affects vulnerable groups: women of childbearing age (especially pregnant women) and young children.
*   Causes include low dietary iron intake and hookworm infestations.

**4. [[Xerophthalmia]] (Nutritional Blindness):**
*   Caused by Vitamin A deficiency.
*   Can lead to Keratomalacia and permanent blindness in children aged 1-3 years.

**5. [[Iodine Deficiency Disorders]] (IDD):**
*   Not restricted to the "Himalayan Goitre Belt" anymore; prevalent in many states.
*   Manifests as **Goitre**, hypothyroidism, impaired mental function, and cretinism.

**6. Other Problems:**
*   **Endemic Fluorosis:** Due to excess fluorine in drinking water (dental and skeletal fluorosis).
*   **Lathyrism:** Neuro-lathyrism caused by consumption of *Khesari dal* (*Lathyrus sativus*) containing the toxin BOAA.
*   **Overnutrition/Obesity:** Increasing prevalence in urban areas contributing to non-communicable diseases (Diabetes, CVD).

### Primary Prevention of Protein Energy Undernutrition (PEM)

Primary prevention aims to prevent the occurrence of PEM before it starts (Pre-pathogenesis phase). It focuses on removing the possibility that the disease will ever occur.

It is achieved through **two main modes of intervention**:

#### A. Health Promotion

1.  **Promotion of [[Breast-feeding]]:**
    *   Encouraging exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months.
    *   Breast milk is the ideal, sterile, and most nutritious food for infants.

2.  **Appropriate [[Weaning Practices]]:**
    *   Introduction of **low-cost weaning foods** (supplementary feeding) starting from 6 months of age.
    *   Child should be fed frequently (5-6 times a day).

3.  **Nutrition Education:**
    *   Educating mothers on correct feeding practices, cooking methods to preserve nutrients, and hygiene.
    *   Removing food taboos and fads.

4.  **Maternal Care:**
    *   Measures directed at pregnant and lactating women (dietary education, supplements).
    *   Improving the health of the mother directly impacts the birth weight of the child.

5.  **Family Planning:**
    *   Spacing of births allows the mother to recover nutritional stores and ensures the current child receives adequate care.

6.  **Family Environment:**
    *   Improving home economics and environmental sanitation to reduce the burden of infections.

#### B. Specific Protection

1.  **Dietary Supplementation:**
    *   Ensuring the child's diet contains protein and energy-rich foods (milk, eggs, fresh fruits).
    *   Fortification of foods where necessary.

2.  **[[Immunization]]:**
    *   Completing the National Immunization Schedule.
    *   Infections like Measles, Diarrhea, and Whooping cough act synergistically with malnutrition; preventing them prevents the vicious cycle of malnutrition-infection.

***

**Clinical Relevance:**
The relationship between **Malnutrition and Infection** is synergistic. An undernourished child is more susceptible to infections (like Diarrhea/Measles), and infections precipitate malnutrition by reducing appetite and increasing metabolic demand. Primary prevention breaks this vicious cycle.
