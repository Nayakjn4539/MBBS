# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > JE Vaccine

# Japanese Encephalitis (JE) Vaccine

### **Overview**
Japanese Encephalitis (JE) is a mosquito-borne viral disease and a leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia. Since there is no specific antiviral treatment for JE, **vaccination** is the single most effective preventive measure. The vaccine is included in the [[Universal Immunization Programme (UIP)]] of India but is restricted to **endemic districts** only.

### **Types of JE Vaccines**

Historically, mouse-brain derived vaccines were used, but they have largely been replaced by safer and more potent cell-culture derived vaccines.

| Feature | **Live Attenuated Vaccine** (Most Common) | **Inactivated (Killed) Vaccine** (Indigenously developed) | **Mouse-Brain Derived** (Obsolete) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strain** | **[[SA 14-14-2]]** | **Kolar Strain (821564XY)** | Nakayama / Beijing |
| **Nature** | Live Attenuated (Cell culture) | Killed / Inactivated (Vero cell culture) | Inactivated |
| **Brand Name** | JE-vac / CD-JEV | **[[JENVAC]]** | -- |
| **Route** | **Subcutaneous (SC)** | **Intramuscular (IM)** | Subcutaneous |
| **Dose** | 0.5 ml | 0.5 ml | 0.5 ml (<3 yrs) / 1.0 ml (>3 yrs) |
| **Availability** | Mainstay of UIP in India | Introduced in India (NIV Pune) | **Discontinued** (production stopped in 2007) |,,

### **Administration in National Immunization Schedule (NIS)**

Under the UIP, the JE vaccine is administered **only in identified endemic districts** (currently >200 districts across states like UP, Assam, West Bengal, Karnataka, etc.).

#### **1. For Children (Pediatric Schedule)**
*   **Target Group:** Children aged 1 to 15 years.
*   **Schedule:** 2 Doses.
    *   **1st Dose:** At **9 completed months** (along with Measles-Rubella 1st dose),.
    *   **2nd Dose:** At **16–24 months** (along with DPT/OPV booster),.
*   **Site:**
    *   **Live Vaccine:** Left Upper Arm (Subcutaneous).
    *   **Killed Vaccine (JENVAC):** Anterolateral aspect of mid-thigh (Intramuscular).

> **Note:** If a child misses the schedule, they are eligible to receive the vaccine up to **15 years of age**.

#### **2. For Adults**
*   **Indication:** Adults (15–65 years) in **high-burden districts** are vaccinated during special campaigns.
*   **Schedule:** Single dose.

### **Cold Chain and Reconstitution**

*   **Storage Temperature:** +2°C to +8°C (Do **not** freeze).
*   **Diluent:**
    *   **Live Vaccine:** **[[Phosphate Buffer Solution]]**.
    *   **Killed Vaccine:** Ready to use (liquid), no diluent required.
*   **Usage:**
    *   **Live Vaccine:** Must be used within **4 hours** of reconstitution (Protect from light). **Open Vial Policy is NOT applicable**.
    *   **Killed Vaccine (JENVAC):** Open Vial Policy **IS applicable** (can be used up to 28 days if stored correctly),.

### **Contraindications**

1.  **Age < 6 months:** JE is infrequent in infancy due to maternal antibodies, and the vaccine is not recommended before this age.
2.  **Pregnancy:** Live vaccines are generally contraindicated (unless the risk of infection is very high).
3.  **Anaphylaxis:** History of severe allergic reaction to a previous dose.
4.  **Severe Acute Illness:** Vaccination should be postponed.
5.  **Immunosuppression:** Live vaccine is contraindicated in symptomatic HIV or severe immunodeficiency.

---

### **Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI)**

The cell-culture vaccines are generally safe.
*   **Common:** Mild local pain, redness, transient fever, headache, irritability,.
*   **Rare:** Hypersensitivity reactions (urticaria, angioedema).
*   **Obsolete Vaccine Side Effect:** The older mouse-brain vaccine was associated with neurological complications (ADEM), which led to its discontinuation.

### **Mnemonic Corner** 🧠

**To remember the Vaccines and Routes:**

*   **"JE SUIS"**
    *   **JE** = Japanese Encephalitis
    *   **S** = **S**A 14-14-2 strain
    *   **U** = **U**pper arm (Left)
    *   **I** = **I**s
    *   **S** = **S**ubcutaneous

*   **"Jen is Cool and Strong"**
    *   **Jen** = **JEN**VAC (Killed vaccine)
    *   **Cool** = **Kolar** Strain
    *   **Strong** = **IM** route (Muscle is strong)

---

### **Clinical Relevance**
*   **Epidemic Control:** In outbreak settings, vaccination campaigns target the susceptible population (1–15 years). Vector control (fogging) is supplementary but vaccination is the primary defense.
*   **Herd Immunity:** High coverage is essential because pigs (amplifier hosts) and birds (reservoirs) maintain the virus in the environment; humans are dead-end hosts, so vaccinating humans protects the individual but does not stop the transmission cycle in nature.
