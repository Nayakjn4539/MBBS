# [[Communicable Diseases - Surface Infections]] > HIV  AIDS

### Epidemiology of HIV / AIDS

**[[Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome]] (AIDS)** is a fatal illness caused by the **[[Human Immunodeficiency Virus]] (HIV)**, which breaks down the body’s immune system, leaving the victim vulnerable to life-threatening opportunistic infections, neurological disorders, and malignancies.

#### 1. Epidemiological Determinants

**A. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus]] (HIV). Formerly known as LAV or HTLV-III.
*   **Family:** Retroviridae (Lentivirus subfamily).
*   **Structure:** Single-stranded [[RNA virus]] with an enzyme called **Reverse Transcriptase**. It has a protein capsule with antigens like gp120 and gp41.
*   **Types:**
    *   **HIV-1:** Most common worldwide; more virulent. Subtype C is the most common in [[India]].
    *   **HIV-2:** Prevalent in West Africa; less transmissible.
*   **Resistance:** The virus is thermolabile.
    *   **Inactivated by:** Heat (56°C for 30 mins), Ether, Acetone, 20% Ethanol, **0.5% [[Sodium Hypochlorite]]**, and 2% Glutaraldehyde.
    *   **Resistant to:** Gamma rays and Ultraviolet light.

**B. Reservoir of Infection**
*   **Reservoir:** Cases and Carriers. Once infected, the person remains infected for life.
*   **Source of Infection:** Greatest concentration of virus is found in:
    *   [[Blood]]
    *   [[Semen]]
    *   [[Cerebrospinal Fluid]] (CSF)
    *   Lower concentrations: Vaginal secretions, breast milk, saliva, tears.

**C. Host Factors**
*   **Age:** Sexually active age group (15–49 years) is most affected.
*   **High-Risk Groups (HRGs):**
    *   [[Female Sex Workers]] (FSW).
    *   Men who have Sex with Men ([[MSM]]).
    *   Injecting Drug Users ([[IDUs]]).
    *   Transgenders/Hijras.
    *   Bridge Population: Truckers and Migrants.
*   **Immunity:** HIV attacks **[[CD4+ T lymphocytes]]** (T-helper cells), leading to a reversal of the CD4:CD8 ratio.

#### 2. Modes of Transmission

| Mode of Transmission | Efficiency of Transmission | Remarks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sexual** (Heterosexual/Homosexual) | 0.01 – 1% | Most common route in India (~86%). Risk increases with presence of other [[STDs]] (ulcerative). Anal sex > Vaginal sex. |
| **Blood Transfusion** | > 90 - 95% | Most efficient route but lowest contribution due to screening. |
| **Sharing Needles** | 0.3% | Common in IDUs. |
| **Perinatal** (Mother to Child) | 25 – 30% | Can occur during pregnancy, delivery, or **[[Breastfeeding]]**. |

#### 3. Incubation and Window Period

*   **[[Incubation Period]]:** Variable; ranges from a few months to **10 years** or more. (Time from infection to development of AIDS).
*   **[[Window Period]]:** Time from infection to the appearance of detectable antibodies (usually **2 to 12 weeks**).
    *   *Clinical Relevance:* During this period, the person is **highly infectious** but tests **negative** on standard antibody tests (ELISA).

#### 4. Clinical Picture (WHO Clinical Staging)

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Flowchart showing the decline of CD4 count and rise of Viral load over time

**Stage 1: Asymptomatic**
*   Asymptomatic infection.
*   Persistent Generalized Lymphadenopathy ([[PGL]]).
*   Performance scale 1: Asymptomatic, normal activity.

**Stage 2: Mild Symptoms**
*   Unexplained moderate weight loss (<10%).
*   Recurrent respiratory infections (Sinusitis, Tonsillitis).
*   **[[Herpes Zoster]]**.
*   Oral ulcerations, Angular cheilitis.

**Stage 3: Advanced Symptoms**
*   Severe weight loss (>10%).
*   Unexplained chronic diarrhea (>1 month).
*   Unexplained persistent fever (>1 month).
*   **[[Pulmonary Tuberculosis]]**.
*   Oral Candidiasis (Thrush).
*   Oral Hairy Leukoplakia.

**Stage 4: Severe Symptoms (AIDS)**
*   **[[HIV Wasting Syndrome]]**.
*   **[[Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia]]** (PCP).
*   Toxoplasmosis of the brain.
*   Extrapulmonary Tuberculosis.
*   **[[Kaposi's Sarcoma]]**.
*   Cryptococcal meningitis.

*   **Mnemonic for WHO Staging:**
    *   **1:** **A**symptomatic
    *   **2:** **B**reathing (URTI), **B**ody loss (<10%)
    *   **3:** **C**ough (TB), **C**andidiasis, **C**hronic diarrhea
    *   **4:** **D**eath imminent (PCP, CNS issues, Cancer)

#### 5. Diagnosis

**A. Screening Tests**
*   **E/R/S Strategy:** [[ELISA]] / Rapid / Simple tests.
*   **Strategy I:** For Blood Safety (1 test).
*   **Strategy II:** For Surveillance/Symptomatic Diagnosis (2 tests).
*   **Strategy III:** For Asymptomatic Diagnosis (3 tests).

**B. Confirmatory Tests**
*   **Adults:** [[Western Blot]] (Gold Standard for antibodies).
*   **Children (<18 months):** **[[DNA PCR]]** (Because maternal antibodies persist in infant, making ELISA unreliable).

**C. Prognostic Tests**
*   **[[CD4 Count]]:** Indicates immune status.
*   **[[Viral Load]] (Plasma RNA):** Best marker for disease progression and response to therapy.

#### 6. Treatment: Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)

*   **Goal:** Viral suppression, immune reconstitution, and improved Quality of Life.
*   **Policy:** **"Treat All"** policy—ART is initiated for all PLHIV regardless of CD4 count or clinical stage.
*   **Preferred First-Line Regimen (Adults):** **[[TLD Regimen]]**
    *   **T**enofovir (TDF)
    *   **L**amivudine (3TC)
    *   **D**olutegravir (DTG) - Integrase Inhibitor.
*   **Prevention of Opportunistic Infections:**
    *   **CPT ([[Co-trimoxazole]] Prophylaxis Therapy):** Given to prevent PCP and Toxoplasmosis if CD4 < 350.
    *   **TPT (TB Preventive Therapy):** Isoniazid for 6 months.

#### 7. Prevention and Control (NACP Strategies)

**A. Primary Prevention**
*   **Health Education:** Awareness about safe sex ("ABC" approach - Abstinence, Be faithful, Condom use).
*   **Blood Safety:** Mandatory screening of blood for HIV, HBV, HCV, Malaria, and Syphilis.
*   **Safe Injection Practices:** Use of auto-disable syringes.
*   **Condom Promotion:** Barrier method for protection.

**B. Secondary Prevention**
*   **[[ICTC]] (Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres):** For early detection and counseling.
*   **Targeted Interventions (TI):** Focused on HRGs (Harm reduction for IDUs, Needle exchange programs).

**C. Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission ([[PPTCT]])**
*   **Regimen:** Life-long ART (Triple drug) for the mother (TDF + 3TC + EFV/DTG) regardless of CD4 count.
*   **Infant Prophylaxis:** [[Nevirapine]] syrup for 6 weeks (extends to 12 weeks if mother not suppressed).
*   **Breastfeeding:** Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for 6 months (benefit outweighs risk in developing countries).

**D. Post-Exposure Prophylaxis ([[PEP]])**
*   Indicated for accidental exposure (needle stick injury, sexual assault).
*   **Time:** Start as soon as possible, ideally within **2 hours**, maximum within **72 hours**.
*   **Duration:** 28 days.
*   **Regimen:** TDF + 3TC + DTG (or LPV/r).

#### 8. National AIDS Control Programme (NACP)
*   **Nodal Agency:** [[NACO]] (National AIDS Control Organization).
*   **Current Phase:** NACP Phase V (Strategic Plan 2017-2024).
*   **Targets:** **95-95-95 Targets by 2030**:
    1.  **95%** of PLHIV know their status.
    2.  **95%** of those diagnosed are on ART.
    3.  **95%** of those on ART have viral suppression.
