# [[Identification]] > Stature Estimation from bones

### Stature Estimation from Bones

Stature (Height) is one of the "Big Four" parameters of [[forensic anthropology]] used for establishing the **identity** of an individual from skeletal remains (the others being Age, Sex, and Race). The estimation is based on the principle of biological correlation, where the length of long bones is proportional to the total height of the individual.

#### 1. General Principles
*   **Best Bone:** The **Femur** is the most reliable bone for stature estimation, followed by the tibia, humerus, and radius.
*   **Measurement Tool:** Long bones are measured using an **[[osteometric board]]**.
*   **Side:** The bone from the **Right** side is preferred for measurement.
*   **Condition:** Ideally, bones should be dry. If soft tissues/cartilage are attached, specific values must be subtracted.

#### 2. Methods of Estimation

There are two main approaches: the **Anatomical Method** (Fully's method) and the **Mathematical Method** (using formulae).

**A. Assessment from Long Bones (Mathematical Method)**
This is the most common method. It utilizes multiplication factors or regression equations.

**i. Multiplication Factors (Pancho’s Method / Humphry’s Table)**
The length of the bone (in cm) is multiplied by a specific coefficient to get the approximate stature.

| Bone | Multiplication Factor (Approx) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Femur** | 3.7 (approx 4) |
| **Tibia** | 4.5 |
| **Fibula** | 4.5 |
| **Humerus** | 5.3 (approx 5) |
| **Radius** | 6.9 (approx 7) |
| **Ulna** | 6.4 (approx 6) |

> **Mnemonic for Multiplication Factors:**
> *   **Femur (Four):** Factor is approx **4** (3.7)
> *   **Humerus (High-Five):** Factor is approx **5** (5.3)
> *   **Radius (Radial-Seven):** Factor is approx **7** (6.9)
> *   **Tibia/Fibula:** Factor is **4.5**

**ii. Regression Formulae**
These are more accurate as they account for variable factors.
*   **[[Trotter and Gleser Formulae]]:** The most widely used regression equations. They are specific for **Sex** and **Race** (White, Black, Mongoloid).
*   **Karl Pearson’s Formula:** One of the oldest regression methods.
*   **Dupertuis and Hadden:** Another set of general formulae.

**B. Assessment from Fragmentary Bones**
If a complete long bone is not available, stature can still be estimated using segments of the bone.
*   **Muller’s Method:** Uses specific landmarks on the bone fragment to infer total length.
*   **Steele’s Method:** Assigns regression formulae to segments of long bones (e.g., proximal femur, distal tibia).

**C. Assessment from Other Skeletal Parts**
When long bones are unavailable, other skeletal elements can provide a rough estimate.

| Part | Relation to Stature |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skull** | Height of skull (with mandible) × **8** = Stature |
| **Vertebral Column** | Length is approx **35%** (35/100) of stature |
| **Sternum** | Length (Manubrium + Body) has correlation (rarely used alone) |
| **Arm Span** | Length from middle finger tip to opposite middle finger tip ≈ **Height** |
| **Forearm** | Length from olecranon to middle finger tip = **5/19** of stature |
| **Single Arm** | (2 × Length of one arm) + 30 cm (clavicles) + 4 cm (sternum) = Height |
| **Vertex to Symphysis** | Roughly **1/2** of total stature |

#### 3. Correction Factors

**i. For Soft Tissue (Flesh):**
Since dry bones lack articular cartilage and skin pads (heel/scalp):
*   **Whole Skeleton:** If reconstructing a complete skeleton, add **2.5 cm to 4 cm** to the total length to account for soft tissue and intervertebral discs.
*   **Wet vs Dry Bones:** Formulae usually assume dry bones. If measuring fresh bones with cartilage:
    *   Subtract **7 mm** for Femur.
    *   Subtract **5 mm** for Humerus.
    *   Subtract **3-4 mm** for Tibia.

**ii. For Age (Senile bowing/shrinkage):**
*   Stature decreases after 30 years due to vertebral disc degeneration and spinal curvature.
*   Subtract approx **0.06 cm per year** of age over 30.

#### 4. Medicolegal Aspects & Limitations

*   **Race Specificity:** Formulae derived for one population (e.g., Americans) may have errors when applied to another (e.g., Indians). Regional formulae (like **Pancho's** for Indians) should be used where available.
*   **Sex Differences:** Females generally have shorter limb bones relative to height compared to males. Sex-specific formulae must be used.
*   **Biological Variation:** Stature varies during the day (taller in the morning by ~2cm) and with posture. Estimates are usually given as a **range** (e.g., 170 cm ± 4 cm) rather than a precise number.
*   **Disarticulation:** In mass disasters or mutilated bodies, identifying matching limbs (e.g., left and right femur of same size) helps confirm if remains belong to **one or more individuals**.
