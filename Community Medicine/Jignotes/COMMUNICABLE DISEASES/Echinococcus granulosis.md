# Echinococcus granulosus (Hydatid Disease)

**Hydatid disease** is a parasitic infestation caused by the larval stage (metacystode) of the tapeworm *Echinococcus granulosus*. It is a significant zoonotic disease classified as a **Cyclo-zoonosis**, meaning it requires more than one vertebrate host species to complete its developmental cycle.

### 1. Epidemiological Determinants

#### Agent Factors
*   **Agent:** *Echinococcus granulosus* (small tapeworm, ~7mm long).
*   **Morphology:** The adult worm has a **scolex** (head) with four suckers and two rows of hooks. It usually has 3 to 4 segments (proglottids).
*   **Viability:** The eggs passed in feces are highly resistant and can survive for months in soil and vegetation.

#### Host Factors (The Life Cycle)
The life cycle revolves around the "Dog-Sheep" cycle.

| Host Type | Animal | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Definitive Host]]** | **Dog** | Harbors the **adult** tapeworm in the intestine. Passes eggs in feces. |
| **[[Intermediate Host]]** | **Sheep**, Cattle | Harbors the **larval stage** (Hydatid cyst) in viscera (liver/lungs) after eating contaminated grass. |
| **[[Accidental Host]]** | **Man** | "Dead-end" host. Infected by ingesting eggs. The cycle stops here as humans are rarely eaten by dogs. |

*   **Mnemonic for Hosts:** 
    *   **D**og is **D**efinitive.
    *   **S**heep is **S**econdary (Intermediate).
    *   **M**an is a **M**istake (Accidental).

#### Environmental Factors
*   Common in sheep-raising countries and areas with poor hygiene where dogs have access to offal (animal viscera).
*   Occupational hazard for shepherds and shoe-makers.

### 2. Mode of Transmission
Human infection occurs via the **Fecal-Oral route**:
1.  **Ingestion:** Consuming water or raw vegetables contaminated with dog feces containing eggs.
2.  **Direct Contact:** Hand-to-mouth transfer of eggs after handling or playing with infected dogs (eggs stick to the dog's fur).
3.  **Inhalation:** Breathing in dust contaminated with eggs.

### 3. Pathogenesis: The Hydatid Cyst
Once eggs are ingested, embryos are released in the intestine, penetrate the wall, and enter the portal circulation. They filter out in various organs to form cysts.

**Structure of the Cyst:**
*   **Ectocyst:** Outer fibrous layer.
*   **Endocyst:** Inner germinal layer (active layer).
*   **Contents:** Hydatid fluid, Brood capsules, and **Scolices** (tapeworm heads).
*   **Daughter Cysts:** Secondary cysts forming inside the main cyst.

### 4. Clinical Features
The incubation period is variable (months to years). The cysts grow slowly, often taking 5 to 20 years to cause symptoms.

*   **Site of Involvement:**
    *   **Liver:** Most common site (**>70%**), specifically the **right lobe**.
    *   **Lungs:** Second most common site.
    *   **Other sites:** Brain, kidney, bones.
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Often asymptomatic for years.
    *   Pressure symptoms: Hepatomegaly, obstructive jaundice (if in liver), chest pain/cough (if in lungs).
    *   **[[Anaphylactic Shock]]:** If the cyst ruptures, the release of hydatid fluid can cause a severe, potentially fatal allergic reaction.

### 5. Diagnosis
*   **Imaging:** **[[Ultrasonography]] (USG)**, MRI, and CT scans are used to locate the cyst and assess its nature.
*   **Serology:** 
    *   **ELISA** and Indirect Hemagglutination (IHA) are highly sensitive.
    *   Double diffusion gel precipitation (DD5).
*   **Intradermal Test:** **[[Casoni's Test]]**
    *   **Procedure:** 0.2 cc of sterile hydatid fluid is injected intradermally.
    *   **Result:** A wheal up to 5mm within 20 minutes indicates a positive result.
    *   *Note:* It has low specificity but is still widely mentioned in older texts due to simplicity.

### 6. Treatment
*   **Surgical:** Removal of the cyst is the primary treatment. Extreme care must be taken not to rupture the cyst to prevent anaphylaxis and secondary spread.
*   **Medical:** Used for inoperable cases or as an adjunct to surgery.
    *   **[[Albendazole]]**: 10-15 mg/kg body weight daily (drug of choice).
    *   **Mebendazole** is an alternative.
    *   **Praziquantel** may also be used.

### 7. Prevention and Control
1.  **Hygiene:** Wash hands after handling dogs and before eating. Wash vegetables thoroughly.
2.  **Control in Dogs:**
    *   Regular de-worming of pet dogs.
    *   Prevent dogs from eating uncooked animal offal/viscera (break the cycle).
    *   Reduction of stray dog populations.
3.  **Meat Inspection:** Proper disposal of infected carcasses and offal (deep burial or burning).
4.  **Health Education:** Educate the community, especially in sheep-rearing areas, about the dangers of feeding raw offal to dogs.
