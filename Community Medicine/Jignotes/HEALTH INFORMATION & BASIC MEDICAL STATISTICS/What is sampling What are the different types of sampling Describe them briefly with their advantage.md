# [[HEALTH INFORMATION & BASIC MEDICAL STATISTICS]] > What is sampling? What are the different types of sampling? Describe them briefly with their advantages and limitations.

### Definition of Sampling

[[Sampling]] is the process of selecting a part of the population (a subset) to represent the entire population (the universe). It is a statistical technique used because studying an entire population (Census) is often operationally impossible, time-consuming, and expensive. 

The selected group is called a **Sample**. If the sample is selected properly, the statistical results (Mean, Proportion, etc.) obtained from it—called **Statistics**—will be very close to the actual values of the population—called **Parameters**.

### Types of Sampling

Sampling techniques are broadly classified into two categories:
1.  **Probability (Random) Sampling:** Every unit has a known and equal chance of selection.
2.  **Non-Probability (Non-Random) Sampling:** The chance of selection is unknown; based on convenience or judgment.

#### A. Probability Sampling Methods

**1. Simple Random Sampling**
This is the most basic form where every individual in the population has an **equal and known chance** of being selected. It is done using the **lottery method** or **table of random numbers**.
*   **Advantages:** 
    *   Free from personal bias (Selection bias).
    *   Most representative of the population if the list is complete.
*   **Limitations:** 
    *   Requires a complete list of the entire population (Sampling frame), which is often unavailable.
    *   Difficult to execute in large, scattered populations.

**2. Systematic Random Sampling**
This method selects samples at regular intervals. It relies on a **Sampling Interval (K)**, calculated as $K = \text{Total Population} / \text{Sample Size}$. The first unit is selected randomly, and then every $K^{th}$ unit is chosen.
*   **Advantages:** 
    *   Simple and convenient to use.
    *   Less time-consuming than simple random sampling.
*   **Limitations:** 
    *   If there is a periodic trend in the population list, the sample may be biased.
    *   Requires a complete list of units.

**3. Stratified Random Sampling**
Used when the population is **heterogeneous**. The population is first divided into homogeneous sub-groups called **Strata** (e.g., based on age, sex, or socioeconomic status). Then, a random sample is drawn from each stratum.
*   **Advantages:** 
    *   Ensures representation of all subgroups (no group is left out).
    *   Greater accuracy/precision than simple random sampling.
*   **Limitations:** 
    *   Requires prior knowledge of the population composition to create strata.
    *   More complex to organize.

**4. Multistage Sampling**
Sampling is done in **stages**. The sampling unit changes at each stage (e.g., Country $\rightarrow$ State $\rightarrow$ District $\rightarrow$ Village $\rightarrow$ Household).
*   **Advantages:** 
    *   **Flexibility:** Does not require a complete list of the entire population initially.
    *   Cost-effective for large country-wide surveys.
*   **Limitations:** 
    *   Less accurate than simple random sampling for the same sample size.

**5. Cluster Sampling**
The population is divided into natural groups or **Clusters** (e.g., villages, wards, slums). Random clusters are selected, and *all* individuals within the selected clusters are surveyed.
*   **Clinical Relevance:** The **WHO $30 \times 7$ technique** (30 clusters, 7 children each) used for evaluating [[Immunization Coverage]] is a classic example.
*   **Advantages:** 
    *   Cheaper, easier, and faster for field surveys.
    *   Does not require a list of individual households.
*   **Limitations:** 
    *   Higher **Sampling Error** compared to simple random sampling.
    *   Clusters may not be comparable to each other.

**6. Multiphase Sampling**
Information is collected in phases. A large sample is surveyed for general information (Phase I), and a smaller sub-sample from it is subjected to detailed examination (Phase II).
*   *Example:* Mantoux test for all $\rightarrow$ X-ray for positives $\rightarrow$ Sputum for X-ray positives.
*   **Advantages:** Less costly and less laborious.

#### B. Non-Probability Sampling Methods

**1. Convenience Sampling**
Selection is based on the ease of access or availability to the researcher (e.g., examining patients in a hospital ward).
*   **Advantages:** Easiest and cheapest.
*   **Limitations:** Highly susceptible to **Selection Bias**; results cannot be generalized to the general population.

**2. Quota Sampling**
Similar to stratified sampling, but the selection within the strata (quotas) is **not random**. The interviewer selects individuals based on their judgment until the quota is filled.
*   **Advantages:** Quick and administrative convenience.
*   **Limitations:** Not representative; personal prejudice may enter.

**3. Snowball Sampling**
The initial subject recruits other subjects from their acquaintances. The sample grows like a rolling snowball.
*   **Clinical Relevance:** Best for **Hidden Populations** or those with social stigma (e.g., [[Drug Abusers]], [[HIV]] patients, Commercial Sex Workers).
*   **Advantages:** Access to difficult-to-reach populations.
*   **Limitations:** Selection bias (network bias).
