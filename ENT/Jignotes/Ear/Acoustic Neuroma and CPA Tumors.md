# [[Ear]] > Acoustic Neuroma and CPA Tumors

### **Acoustic Neuroma (Vestibular Schwannoma)**

**Overview and Nomenclature**
*   **Definition:** It is a benign, encapsulated, extremely slow-growing tumor of the [[8th Cranial Nerve]] (Vestibulocochlear nerve).
*   **Terminology:** The term "Acoustic Neuroma" is a misnomer because the tumor arises from the Schwann cells of the nerve sheath (hence **Schwannoma**) and usually originates from the vestibular division rather than the cochlear (acoustic) division.
*   **Incidence:** It constitutes 80% of all [[Cerebellopontine Angle]] (CPA) tumors and 8–10% of all intracranial tumors.
*   **Demographics:** Commonly seen in the age group of 40–60 years with equal sex distribution (or slight female preponderance).

**Etiology and Genetics**
*   **Sporadic:** Most cases (95%) are unilateral and sporadic.
*   **[[Neurofibromatosis Type 2]] (NF-2):** 5% of cases are associated with NF-2. These patients typically present with **bilateral** acoustic neuromas.
    *   *Clinical Implication:* In younger patients (20–30 years), NF-2 must be ruled out.

**Pathology**
*   **Gross Appearance:** Firm, encapsulated, gray/yellow mass. Larger tumors may have cystic degeneration.
*   **Histopathology:** Shows two distinct patterns of cells:
    1.  **Antoni A:** Compact, dense, cellular areas with elongated spindle cells and rod-shaped nuclei aligned in rows or palisades (Verocay bodies).
    2.  **Antoni B:** Loose, less cellular, reticular tissue with cystic spaces.

**Site of Origin**
*   Arises from the **Schwann cells** of the vestibular nerve, more commonly the **inferior vestibular nerve**, followed by the superior vestibular nerve.
*   The specific site of origin is the **[[Obersteiner-Redlich Zone]]**, which is the transition zone from central (glial) myelin to peripheral (Schwann cell) myelin, located within the [[Internal Acoustic Meatus]] (IAM).

### **Clinical Features and Staging**

The tumor starts in the IAM and expands into the CPA. Symptoms progress in stages:

**1. Otological Stage (Intracanalicular / Early CPA)**
*   **Hearing Loss:** Progressive unilateral [[Sensorineural Hearing Loss]] (SNHL). This is the earliest and most common symptom.
    *   *Note:* 10% of patients may present with sudden hearing loss.
    *   Difficulty in understanding speech is disproportionate to the pure tone hearing loss (characteristic feature).
*   **Tinnitus:** Unilateral, often the presenting symptom even in small tumors.
*   **Vestibular Symptoms:** Unsteadiness or imbalance is common. True vertigo is rare because the slow growth allows for central vestibular compensation.

**2. Trigeminal Nerve Involvement (Tumor > 2 cm)**
*   **Corneal Reflex:** Loss of corneal reflex is the **earliest ocular sign** and an early sign of trigeminal involvement.
*   **Sensory Changes:** Paresthesia or numbness of the face (mid-facial region).
*   **[[Hitzelberger's Sign]]:** Hypoesthesia or anesthesia of the posterosuperior wall of the external auditory canal (supplied by the sensory branch of [[Facial Nerve]]). This is seen in about 25% of patients.

**3. Brainstem and Cerebellar Compression (Stage 3)**
*   **Cerebellar Signs:** Ataxia, dysdiadochokinesia, broad-based gait, and nystagmus.
*   **[[Brun's Nystagmus]]:** Direction-changing nystagmus seen when cerebellar connections are involved.
*   **Lower Cranial Nerves:** Involvement of IX, X, and XI (Jugular foramen syndrome) leads to dysphagia and hoarseness.

**4. Raised Intracranial Pressure (Stage 4 / Terminal)**
*   Headache (occipital/frontal), vomiting, papilledema, and obtundation due to obstruction of the 4th ventricle and hydrocephalus.

### **Investigations**

**Audiometry**
*   **Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA):** Unilateral or asymmetric SNHL, usually high frequency.
*   **Speech Audiometry:** Poor speech discrimination score (SDS), disproportionately worse than the pure tone threshold.
*   **Rollover Phenomenon:** As speech intensity increases beyond a certain level, the discrimination score paradoxically decreases (PB Max).
*   **Recruitment:** Typically **absent** (characteristic of retrocochlear lesions).
*   **Tone Decay:** Positive (retrocochlear sign).
*   **Acoustic Reflex Decay:** Positive.

**Electrophysiology**
*   **[[Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry]] (BERA/ABR):** The most reliable audiological test.
    *   **Finding:** Increased inter-aural latency difference of **Wave V** (> 0.2 ms) or prolonged I–V interval.

**Imaging**
*   **[[MRI]] with Gadolinium Contrast:** The **Gold Standard** investigation.
    *   Can detect tumors as small as a few millimeters.
    *   **Appearance:** Strongly enhancing mass extending from the IAM into the CPA, often described as an **"Ice-cream cone"** appearance.
*   **CT Scan:** Useful to see bony erosion (widening of IAM) but less sensitive for small tumors.

### **Differential Diagnosis: CPA Tumors**

Acoustic neuroma accounts for ~80% of CPA masses. Others include:

| Tumor | Origin/Features | MRI Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Meningioma]]** | Arises from arachnoid villi/dura. Second most common. | **Dural tail sign**. Broad-based attachment. Calcification common. |
| **[[Epidermoid Cyst]]** | Congenital cholesteatoma (Pearly tumor). | Isointense to CSF on T1/T2 but **bright on Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI)**. Does not enhance. |
| **[[Glomus Jugulare]]** | Vascular tumor. | **"Salt and pepper"** appearance (flow voids). Pulsatile tinnitus. |
| **[[Facial Nerve Schwannoma]]** | Facial nerve. | Enhancing mass. Clinical facial palsy is more common/early compared to acoustic neuroma. |
| **[[Cholesterol Granuloma]]** | Petrous apex. | **Hyperintense** (bright) on both T1 and T2. |

### **Management**

Treatment depends on tumor size, hearing status, age, and patient preference.

**1. Conservative (Wait and Scan)**
*   **Indication:** Small tumors (< 1.5 cm), elderly patients (> 65 years), or patients with significant comorbidities.
*   **Protocol:** Annual MRI scans to monitor growth.

**2. Stereotactic Radiosurgery ([[Gamma Knife]])**
*   **Principle:** Convergent radiation beams arrest tumor growth (does not remove it).
*   **Indication:** Small tumors (< 3 cm), elderly patients, or refusal of surgery.
*   **Advantage:** Preserves facial nerve function better than surgery in some cases; non-invasive.

**3. Microsurgery**
*   **Goal:** Total removal with preservation of facial nerve.
*   **Approaches:**

| Approach | Indications | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Translabyrinthine** | Any size, non-serviceable hearing. | Direct view of facial nerve in IAM. No cerebellar retraction. | **Total hearing loss** (labyrinthectomy). |
| **Retrosigmoid (Suboccipital)** | Large tumors, or hearing preservation attempted. | Wide exposure. **Hearing preservation possible**. | Cerebellar retraction needed. Post-op headache. |
| **Middle Cranial Fossa** | Small (< 1 cm) intracanalicular tumors with **good hearing**. | **Hearing preservation**. | Temporal lobe retraction. Technically difficult. |

### **Auditory Rehabilitation**
*   **Unilateral Deafness:** [[Bone Anchored Hearing Aid]] (BAHA) or CROS hearing aids.
*   **NF-2 (Bilateral Deafness):** If cochlear nerves are sacrificed bilaterally, an **[[Auditory Brainstem Implant]] (ABI)** is placed in the lateral recess of the 4th ventricle to stimulate the cochlear nucleus directly.
