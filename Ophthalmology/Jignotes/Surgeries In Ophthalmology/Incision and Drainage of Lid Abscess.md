# [[Surgeries In Ophthalmology]] > Incision and Drainage of Lid Abscess

# Incision and Drainage of Lid Abscess

## 1. Overview and Indications
A [[Lid Abscess]] is a localized collection of pus within the eyelid tissues. It typically arises as a complication of an [[External Hordeolum]] (Stye) or [[Internal Hordeolum]] (infected Meibomian gland), or rarely from preseptal cellulitis or trauma.

### Indications for Surgery
*   **Pointing Abscess:** When a distinct "pus point" is visible on the lid margin, skin, or conjunctiva.
*   **Failure of Conservative Therapy:** When hot compresses, epilation of affected lashes, and antibiotics fail to resolve the infection.
*   **Large Abscess:** Large fluctuant swelling causing significant pain or mechanical ptosis.

## 2. Surgical Instruments and Equipment
The procedure requires specific instruments to ensure precise incision and adequate drainage while protecting the globe.

### Essential Instruments
| Instrument | Description & Function | Clinical Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Scalpel Handle]]** | Usually a **Bard-Parker handle (No. 3)**. Used to hold the blade firmly. | Fitted with **Blade No. 11** (pointed) for stab incisions or **No. 15** for skin incisions. |
| **[[Plain Dissecting Forceps]]** | Forceps without teeth (serrated tips). Used to hold delicate lid skin or conjunctiva during incision. | Toothed forceps are generally avoided on the lid skin to prevent trauma. |
| **[[Artery Forceps]]** (Hemostat) | Blunt-tipped stout forceps with a locking mechanism. Used to hold swabs for hemostasis or for **blunt dissection** (opening the abscess cavity). | Small-sized (Mosquito) artery forceps are preferred for ophthalmic surgery. |

### Additional Required Items
*   **Lid Spatula:** Used to support the lid and protect the eyeball/cornea during the incision,.
*   **Local Anesthetic:** 2% [[Lignocaine]] with or without adrenaline.
*   **Syringe and Needle:** For infiltration.
*   **Antibiotic Ointment:** For post-operative dressing.

## 3. Pre-operative Preparation
1.  **Consent:** Informed consent regarding pain, bleeding, and recurrence.
2.  **Anesthesia:**
    *   **Topical:** 4% Xylocaine drops for conjunctival anesthesia (if draining from inside).
    *   **Infiltration:** Local infiltration of the lid around the abscess with 2% Xylocaine.
    *   *Note:* Infiltration directly into the abscess is contraindicated (painful and ineffective due to acidic pH of pus).

## 4. Surgical Steps

The approach depends on whether the abscess is pointing externally (skin) or internally (conjunctiva).

### A. External Abscess (External Hordeolum/Stye)
1.  **Protection:** Place a **Lid Spatula** required to protect the globe if the abscess is large or deep.
2.  **Incision:**
    *   Make a **Horizontal Incision** (parallel to the lid margin) over the point of maximum fluctuation using the [[Scalpel Blade]].
    *   **Reasoning:** This aligns with the skin crease and the orientation of the [[Orbicularis Oculi]] muscle fibers, resulting in minimal scarring and avoiding cutting muscle fibers across.
3.  **Drainage:**
    *   Use the **Plain Forceps** to stabilize the skin.
    *   Evacuate pus.
    *   If loculated, insert the closed tip of the **Artery Forceps** into the incision and open them gently to break septa (Hilton’s Method).
4.  **Curettage:** Gently remove necrotic debris if necessary.

### B. Internal Abscess (Internal Hordeolum)
1.  **Eversion:** Evert the eyelid to expose the tarsal conjunctiva where the pus points (yellowish area).
2.  **Incision:**
    *   Make a **Vertical Incision** (perpendicular to the lid margin) using the scalpel.
    *   **Reasoning:** The [[Meibomian Glands]] are arranged vertically. A vertical incision avoids cutting across adjacent healthy ducts, preventing damage to the glandular structure.
3.  **Drainage:** The contents are drained/scooped out.

### Comparison of Incision Orientation
| Approach | Incision Direction | Anatomical Basis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Skin Side** (External) | **Horizontal** | Parallel to [[Skin Crease]] and [[Orbicularis Oculi]] fibers to reduce scarring. |
| **Conjunctival Side** (Internal) | **Vertical** | Parallel to the vertical arrangement of [[Meibomian Glands]] to avoid severing adjacent ducts. |

## 5. Post-operative Care
1.  **Haemostasis:** Apply pressure with a gauze pad held by artery forceps if bleeding occurs.
2.  **Medication:** Apply antibiotic eye ointment (e.g., Chloramphenicol or Ciprofloxacin) into the fornix and over the wound.
3.  **Patching:** Apply a sterile eye pad and bandage for 4–6 hours to apply pressure and prevent edema.
4.  **Follow-up:**
    *   Hot fomentation 2–3 times a day.
    *   Topical antibiotic drops/ointment for 5–7 days.
    *   Systemic anti-inflammatory/analgesics for pain relief.

---

## 6. Complications
*   **Incomplete Drainage:** Leading to recurrence.
*   **Cellulitis:** Spreading of infection if squeezed or manipulated roughly.
*   **Scarring:** Improper incision orientation on the skin (vertical incision on skin creates unsightly scars).
*   **Lid Deformity:** Damage to the tarsal plate or lid margin.

### **Clinical Implication: "Don't Squeeze the Stye"**
For an **External Hordeolum** (Stye), surgical incision is rarely the first step. Evacuation is often achieved simply by **epilating** (pulling out) the involved eyelash, which allows the pus to drain through the hair follicle,. Squeezing a stye without drainage can cause retrograde spread of infection via valveless veins to the [[Cavernous Sinus]].

### **Mnemonic for Incision Orientation**
*   **S**kin = **S**ide to side (**Horizontal**)
*   **T**arsal (Conjunctiva) = **T**all (**Vertical**)
