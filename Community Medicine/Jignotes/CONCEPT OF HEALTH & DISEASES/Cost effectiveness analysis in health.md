# [[CONCEPT OF HEALTH & DISEASES]] > Cost effectiveness analysis in health

# Cost Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) in Health

### Definition
**Cost Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)** is a specific type of economic analysis used in health planning and management. It assesses the desirability of a program or intervention by comparing the **monetary cost** of resources used (input) with the **health outcomes** achieved (output), expressed in *non-monetary* natural units.

It answers the question: *"Which programme among several alternatives will be most effective for a given investment of funds?"*.

### Key Features
*   **Input Measurement:** Costs are measured in monetary terms (Rupees, Dollars, etc.).
*   **Output Measurement:** Benefits/Outcomes are measured in **natural units** or physical units, such as:
    *   Number of [[lives saved]].
    *   Number of cases prevented/cured.
    *   Years of life gained.
    *   Number of days free from disease.
*   **Goal:** To identify the intervention that achieves the desired objective at the lowest cost, or achieves the maximum benefit for a fixed budget.

### Unit of Measurement
Unlike [[Cost Benefit Analysis]], where the outcome is money, CEA uses specific health indicators. The most comprehensive indicators used in CEA are:
*   **[[QALY]]** (Quality Adjusted Life Years) gained.
*   **[[DALY]]** (Disability Adjusted Life Years) averted.

### The Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (CER)
The efficiency of a program is often expressed as a ratio:

$$ \text{Cost Effectiveness Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cost of Alternative (Monetary)}}{\text{Effectiveness (Non-monetary unit)}} $$

*   *Interpretation:* A lower ratio indicates better efficiency (cheaper to save one life).

### Pathway of Cost Effective Analysis
> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Flowchart showing the steps: Define Program -> Compute Net Costs -> Compute Net Health Effects -> Apply Decision Rules -> Sensitivity Analysis

1.  **Define the programme:** Who, what, where, when.
2.  **Compute Net Costs:** Gross program costs minus financial savings.
3.  **Compute Net Health Effects:** In terms of additional years of healthy life.
4.  **Apply Decision Rules:** Identify cases based on costs and effects.
5.  **Perform Sensitivity Analysis:** Test how results change with different variables.

### Comparison: Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) vs. Cost Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)

| Feature | Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) | Cost Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Input (Cost)** | Monetary (Money) | Monetary (Money) |
| **Output (Outcome)** | **Monetary terms** (Money value of benefits) | **Natural/Health units** (Lives saved, cases cured) |
| **Approach** | "Human Capital Approach" or "Willingness to Pay" | Functional status or Clinical endpoints |
| **Primary Use** | Justifying a program economically (Is it profitable?) | Choosing the **best alternative** for health impact |
| **Limitation** | Difficult to put a price tag on human life or suffering. | Cannot compare interventions with totally different outcomes. |

### Clinical Relevance & Examples

*   **[[Tuberculosis Control]]:**
    A classic example of CEA is the comparison between **[[DOTS]]** (Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course) and conventional TB treatment. Studies showed that DOTS was 2.4 to 4.2 times more cost-effective than conventional treatment. It was cheaper for the health system and the patient while producing higher cure rates.

*   **Child Survival Strategies:**
    Comparing **[[Immunization]]** vs. Curative treatment.
    *   *Alternative A (Immunization):* Rs. 25,000 spent saves 100 lives -> Cost per life saved = **Rs. 250**.
    *   *Alternative B (Curative):* Rs. 25,000 spent saves 15 lives -> Cost per life saved = **Rs. 1667**.
    *   *Conclusion:* Immunization is more cost-effective.

### Mnemonic
To remember the difference between **CBA** and **CEA**:

**"B" for Bank, "E" for Effect**

*   **C**ost **B**enefit Analysis = Output is in **Bank** terms (Money).
*   **C**ost **E**ffectiveness Analysis = Output is the **Effect** on health (Lives/Cures).
