# Eye Speculums

**[[Eye Speculums]]** are essential surgical instruments used to retract the eyelids and keep the palpebral aperture open during various ocular procedures. They act as "shutters" to maintain exposure of the globe.

### Types of Eye Speculums

1.  **Universal Metallic Eye Speculum**
    *   **Design:** It consists of two limbs and a spring mechanism with a screw to adjust the width of the limbs. The blades are usually fenestrated (open).
    *   **Features:** It is termed "universal" because the same instrument can be used for both the right and left eye.
    *   **Usage:** Commonly used for general exposure.

2.  **Eye Speculum with Guard (Solid Blades)**
    *   **Design:** Similar to the universal speculum but features **solid blades** instead of open wire loops.
    *   **Function:** In addition to retracting the lids, the solid blades cover the eyelashes (guard them), preventing them from entering the sterile surgical field.
    *   **Clinical Significance:** Essential for maintaining asepsis by isolating the [[Eyelashes]] from the operative site.

3.  **Wire Speculum (Barraquer Type)**
    *   **Design:** Simple, lightweight wire construction.
    *   **Features:** It exerts **minimal pressure** on the [[Eyeball]]. Like the metallic speculum, it is also universal (fits both eyes).
    *   **Usage:** Preferred in surgeries where external pressure on the globe must be minimized (e.g., [[Phacoemulsification]], open globe repairs).

### Uses of Eye Speculums
They are employed to keep the lids apart during:
*   **Intraocular Surgeries:** [[Cataract Surgery]], [[Glaucoma Surgery]], [[Keratoplasty]].
*   **Extraocular Surgeries:** [[Squint Surgery]], [[Pterygium]] excision.
*   **Destructive Procedures:** [[Enucleation]] and [[Evisceration]].
*   **Minor Procedures:** Removal of conjunctival or corneal [[Foreign Bodies]], cauterization of corneal ulcers.
*   **Examination:** Facilitating ocular examination in patients with severe [[Blepharospasm]].

# Postoperative Care and Treatment

Proper postoperative management is crucial to ensure the success of ocular surgery and prevent complications like [[Endophthalmitis]]. The following protocols generally apply to intraocular surgeries (e.g., Cataract extraction).

### Immediate Postoperative Care (0-24 Hours)

*   **Patient Positioning:** The patient is advised to lie quietly on their back (supine) for about **1 to 3 hours** post-surgery.
*   **Oral Intake:** Patients are generally advised to take "nil orally" immediately after surgery for a short duration to prevent nausea/vomiting, especially if sedation was used.
*   **Pain Management:** For mild-to-moderate postoperative pain, oral analgesics (e.g., [[Diclofenac Sodium]]) or intramuscular injections are prescribed.
*   **Protection:** An eye pad/shield is applied immediately after surgery to protect the eye.

### First Postoperative Day (24 Hours)

*   **Bandage Removal:** The eye patch/bandage is removed the next morning.
*   **Inspection:** The eye is thoroughly inspected for early complications such as:
    *   [[Hyphema]] (blood in anterior chamber).
    *   [[Iris Prolapse]].
    *   Striate [[Keratopathy]] (corneal edema).
    *   Flat or shallow [[Anterior Chamber]].
    *   Signs of Infection (Endophthalmitis).
*   **Initial Medication:** Under normal circumstances, the eye is opened, and the first doses of medication (Antibiotic-Steroid drops and Cyclopentolate) are instilled.
*   **Protection:** The patient is advised to wear dark/tinted glasses to prevent photophobia and accidental trauma.

### Postoperative Medication Regimen

A standard regimen (typically for 4–6 weeks) involves the following:

| Drug Category | Example | Frequency/Duration | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Topical Antibiotics]]** | [[Moxifloxacin]] / [[Ofloxacin]] | 4 times/day for 10–14 days. | Prevention of bacterial infection ([[Endophthalmitis]]). |
| **[[Topical Corticosteroids]]** | [[Prednisolone]] / [[Betamethasone]] | 3–4 times/day, tapered over 6–8 weeks. | Control postoperative inflammation (Uveitis). |
| **[[NSAIDs]]** (Topical) | [[Ketorolac]] / [[Nepafenac]] | 2–3 times/day for 4 weeks. | Reduce inflammation and prevent [[Cystoid Macular Edema]]. |
| **[[Mydriatics]] / Cycloplegics** | [[Cyclopentolate]] (1%) / [[Homatropine]] | Once daily for 10–14 days. | Relieve ciliary spasm (pain) and prevent posterior [[Synechiae]]. |
| **Anti-glaucoma agents** | [[Timolol]] (0.5%) | Twice daily for 5–7 days (if indicated). | Control transient postoperative rise in [[Intraocular Pressure]]. |

### General Precautions and Follow-up

*   **Hygiene:** Avoid rubbing the eyes or splashing water directly into the open eye.
*   **Physical Activity:** Avoid strenuous activity, heavy lifting, or straining (Valsalva maneuver) for the first few weeks.
*   **Follow-up Visits:** Typically scheduled at:
    *   Day 1.
    *   1 week.
    *   1 month.
    *   3 months.
*   **Refraction:** Final prescription of [[Spectacles]] is done once the refraction stabilizes:
    *   **[[Phacoemulsification]]:** After 3–4 weeks.
    *   **[[SICS]] (Small Incision Cataract Surgery):** After 6–8 weeks.
