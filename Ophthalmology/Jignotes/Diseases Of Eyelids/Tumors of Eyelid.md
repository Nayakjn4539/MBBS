# Tumors of the Eyelid

Tumors of the eyelid can be broadly classified into **Benign**, **Pre-malignant**, and **Malignant**. While benign tumors (like [[Papilloma]], [[Nevus]], [[Xanthelasma]], [[Haemangioma]]) are common, malignant tumors require prompt diagnosis to prevent orbital invasion and metastasis.

### Classification of Eyelid Tumors

| Category | Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Benign** | [[Squamous Papilloma]], [[Seborrheic Keratosis]], [[Nevus]], [[Xanthelasma]], [[Hemangioma]], [[Neurofibroma]] |
| **Pre-malignant** | [[Actinic Keratosis]] (Solar keratosis), [[Carcinoma in Situ]] (Bowen's disease), [[Xeroderma Pigmentosa]] |
| **Malignant** | **[[Basal Cell Carcinoma]] (BCC)**, **[[Sebaceous Gland Carcinoma]] (SGC)**, [[Squamous Cell Carcinoma]] (SCC), [[Malignant Melanoma]] |

## [[Basal Cell Carcinoma]] (BCC)

This is the **most common malignant tumor** of the eyelids (accounting for approx. 90% of cases in Western literature). It is a slow-growing, locally invasive tumor that **rarely metastasizes** (hence the nickname "Rodent Ulcer" as it burrows locally).

### Epidemiology and Risk Factors
*   **Age:** Usually affects elderly people.
*   **Skin Type:** More common in fair-skinned individuals (White skin).
*   **Etiology:** Prolonged exposure to sunlight (UV radiation).
*   **Site predilection:**
    1.  **Lower lid** (Most common - 50%)
    2.  [[Medial Canthus]] (25%) - *High risk of orbital extension due to lack of tarsal plate barrier.*
    3.  Upper lid (10-15%)
    4.  Lateral Canthus (5-10%)

### Clinical Types and Features
1.  **Nodulo-Ulcerative Type (Most Common):**
    *   Starts as a small, painless, translucent nodule.
    *   Central necrosis leads to ulceration.
    *   **Key Sign:** **Pearly rolled margins** with surface **telangiectasia** (dilated blood vessels).
    *   Slowly erodes surrounding tissue (Rodent Ulcer).
2.  **Sclerosing (Morphea) Type:**
    *   Presents as a flat, indurated, pale plaque.
    *   Margins are indistinct; simulates chronic [[Blepharitis]] or [[Dermatitis]].
    *   Most dangerous type due to insidious spread and difficult excision.
3.  **Pigmented BCC:**
    *   Contains pigment, mimicking [[Malignant Melanoma]].

### Histopathology
*   Tumor arises from the basal layer of the epidermis.
*   **Characteristic finding:** Nests of basaloid cells with **Peripheral Palisading** (nuclei aligned parallel to the periphery of the nest).

### Management
*   **Surgical Excision:** Treatment of choice.
    *   Wide excision with a **3-4 mm safety margin** of normal tissue.
    *   **[[Mohs' Micrographic Surgery]]:** Gold standard for tissue conservation and ensuring clear margins.
    *   Reconstruction of the lid defect using flaps or grafts.
*   **Radiation/Cryotherapy:** Reserved for palliative care or patients unfit/unwilling for surgery.

> **Clinical Implication:** A non-healing ulcer on the lower lid with rolled edges in an elderly patient is [[Basal Cell Carcinoma]] until proven otherwise.

## [[Sebaceous Gland Carcinoma]] (SGC)

A highly malignant and potentially lethal tumor arising from the meibomian glands (tarsal plate) or glands of Zeis (cilia). It is known for its aggressive nature and tendency to metastasize.

### Epidemiology
*   **Geography:** While rare in the West, it is very common in **India/Asia** (reported as the #1 or #2 most common eyelid malignancy in some Indian studies).
*   **Age/Sex:** Elderly, slight female preponderance.
*   **Site:** **Upper Lid** > Lower Lid (because [[Meibomian Glands]] are more numerous in the upper lid).

### Clinical Presentation (The Great Masquerader)
SGC often mimics benign conditions, leading to delayed diagnosis (**Masquerade Syndrome**):

1.  **Nodular Form:**
    *   Presents as a hard, yellow-ish nodule.
    *   **Mistaken for:** Recurrent [[Chalazion]].
    *   *Note:* Any recurrent chalazion must be biopsied to rule out SGC.
2.  **Spreading Form:**
    *   Diffuse thickening of the lid margin with redness and crusting.
    *   **Mistaken for:** Chronic [[Blepharitis]] or [[Conjunctivitis]].
3.  **Pagetoid Spread:**
    *   Intra-epithelial spread of tumor cells to the palpebral, forniceal, and bulbar conjunctiva.

### Clinical Signs
*   **Yellowish hue** due to lipid content.
*   **[[Madarosis]]:** Loss of eyelashes in the affected area (distinguishing it from chalazion).
*   **[[Poliosis]]:** Whitening of lashes.
*   **[[Tylosis]]:** Thickening of the lid margin.
*   Pre-auricular or submandibular lymphadenopathy (metastasis).

### Histopathology
*   Lobules of cells with foamy cytoplasm (lipid-filled).
*   Requires special lipid stains (e.g., Oil Red O) on fresh frozen tissue (lipid dissolves in routine alcohol processing).

### Patterns of Spread
1.  **Local:** Direct invasion into the orbit.
2.  **Lymphatic:** Pre-auricular and submandibular lymph nodes (high rate of metastasis).
3.  **Hematogenous:** To lungs, liver, and brain.

### Management
*   **Map Biopsy:** Multiple conjunctival biopsies to determine the extent of Pagetoid spread.
*   **Wide Surgical Excision:** 5-6 mm clearance margin with frozen section control.
*   **Exenteration:** Removal of orbital contents if the tumor has spread into the orbit.
*   **Systemic Evaluation:** Check for lymph node and organ metastasis.

> **Clinical Implication:** **Recurrent Chalazion** in an elderly patient, especially on the upper lid, is a "Red Flag" for [[Sebaceous Gland Carcinoma]]. Always biopsy!

## Comparison: BCC vs SGC

| Feature | [[Basal Cell Carcinoma]] (BCC) | [[Sebaceous Gland Carcinoma]] (SGC) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Origin** | Basal cells of epidermis | [[Meibomian Glands]] / Glands of Zeis |
| **Common Site** | **Lower Lid** | **Upper Lid** |
| **Growth Pattern** | Slow, local invasion ("Rodent") | Aggressive, Pagetoid spread |
| **Metastasis** | Rare | Common (Lymph nodes, Liver, Lungs) |
| **Typical Appearance** | Ulcer with pearly rolled margins | Yellow nodule or diffuse thickening |
| **Mistaken for** | Non-healing wound | [[Chalazion]] or [[Blepharitis]] |
| **Mortality** | Low | Significant (due to metastasis) |
