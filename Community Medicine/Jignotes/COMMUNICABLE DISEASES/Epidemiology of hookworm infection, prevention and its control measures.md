# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Epidemiology of hookworm infection, prevention and its control measures

### **Epidemiology of Hookworm Infection**

**Hookworm infection** (Ancylostomiasis/Necatoriasis) is a major public health problem, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. It is often referred to as a "Social Disease" because its prevalence is deeply rooted in poor sanitation, poverty, and ignorance.

### **1. Epidemiological Determinants**

#### **A. Agent Factors**
*   **Causative Agents:**
    1.  *[[Ancylostoma duodenale]]* (Old World Hookworm).
    2.  *[[Necator americanus]]* (New World Hookworm).
*   **Reservoir:** **Man** is the only important reservoir of infection.
*   **Infective Material:** Soil contaminated with **infective larvae** (not fresh feces).
*   **Infective Stage:** Filariform larva (3rd stage larva).
*   **Period of Infectivity:** As long as the person harbors the parasite and pollutes the soil (Adult worms can live 1–4 years).

#### **B. Host Factors**
*   **Age & Sex:** All ages are susceptible. Highest incidence is often seen in the **15–25 age group**.
*   **Nutrition:** Malnutrition is a predisposing factor. The disease manifests severely in those with low iron stores.
*   **Occupation:** It is an **occupational disease** of the farming community (agricultural workers) who work barefoot in fields.
*   **Human Habits:** Open air defecation (indiscriminate soil pollution) and walking barefoot are the most critical factors.

#### **C. Environmental Factors**
The environment acts as a "incubator" for the eggs to develop into larvae.
*   **Soil:** Damp, **sandy**, or friable soil with decaying vegetation is ideal. Clay soil is unfavorable.
*   **Temperature:** 24°C to 32°C is optimum.
*   **Moisture:** Essential for survival; dryness kills the larvae.
*   **Shade:** Direct sunlight kills the larvae; they require shade.

> **Mnemonic for Environmental Factors: SAND**
> *   **S**andy soil
> *   **A**ir (Oxygen required)
> *   **N**o sunlight (Shade required)
> *   **D**ampness (Moisture required)

### **2. Mode of Transmission**

1.  **Percutaneous (Major Route):** Infective **filariform larvae** in the soil penetrate the skin, usually of the feet (via barefoot walking) or hands.
2.  **Oral Route:** Infection can occur by ingestion of infective larvae via contaminated food/water/vegetables (Specific to *[[Ancylostoma duodenale]]*).

**Incubation Period (Pre-patent period):**
*   *N. americanus*: ~7 weeks.
*   *A. duodenale*: 5 weeks to 9 months (larvae can remain dormant).

### **3. Clinical Relevance & Impact**

*   **Individual Level:**
    *   **Iron Deficiency Anemia:** Chronic blood loss leads to microcytic hypochromic anemia.
        *   Blood loss per worm: 0.03 to 0.2 ml/day.
    *   **Hypoalbuminemia:** Due to plasma loss.
    *   **In Pregnancy:** Leads to low birth weight, abortion, and stillbirths.
    *   **In Children:** Retarded physical growth and cognitive development.
    *   **Cutaneous Larva Migrans:** Creeping eruption caused by larval migration.

*   **Community Level:**
    *   Reduces work productivity and economic growth.

### **4. Assessment of Burden: [[Chandler's Index]]**

This is the standard epidemiological index to measure the intensity of hookworm infection in a community. It calculates the **average number of eggs per gram of feces** for the entire community.

| Average eggs/gm of feces | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **< 200** | Not significant |
| **200 – 250** | Potential danger |
| **250 – 300** | Minor public health problem |
| **> 300** | **Important Public Health Problem** |

### **5. Prevention and Control Measures**

The strategy involves a multi-pronged approach:

#### **A. Primary Prevention (Interrupting Transmission)**
1.  **Sanitary Disposal of Excreta:**
    *   This is the only long-term solution.
    *   Prevention of soil pollution through the use of **sanitary latrines**.
    *   Discontinuation of the use of untreated human excreta (night soil) as fertilizer.

2.  **Personal Protection:**
    *   Wearing **protective footwear** (shoes/chappals) to prevent skin penetration.
    *   Wearing gloves while handling mud/soil.

3.  **Health Education:**
    *   Educating the community about the hazards of open defecation and the importance of handwashing.

#### **B. Secondary Prevention (Control of Reservoir)**
1.  **Mass Chemotherapy (Periodic Deworming):**
    *   **[[Albendazole]]**: 400 mg single dose (Drug of Choice).
    *   **Mebendazole**: 100 mg twice daily for 3 days or 500 mg single dose.
    *   **Pyrantel Pamoate**: 10 mg/kg single dose.
    *   *Target Groups:* Preschool children, school-age children, and women of childbearing age.

2.  **Correction of Anemia:**
    *   Oral iron supplementation (Ferrous sulphate 200 mg TDS) to restore hemoglobin levels.
    *   Dietary improvement (Protein and Vitamin C rich diet).
