# Oral Ulcers

Oral ulcers are a common presentation in clinical practice, ranging from benign recurrent lesions to manifestations of systemic disease or malignancy. A systematic approach to history and examination is essential for diagnosis.

### Classification of Oral Ulcers

The etiology of oral ulcers is multifactorial.

| Category | Specific Causes |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Infections** | **Viral:** [[Herpes simplex]] (primary and secondary), [[Coxsackie virus]] (Herpangina, Hand-foot-and-mouth disease), [[Epstein-Barr virus]], [[HIV]], [[Cytomegalovirus]].<br>**Bacterial:** [[Vincent's angina]] (ANUG), [[Syphilis]], [[Tuberculosis]].<br>**Fungal:** [[Candidiasis]] (can present as erosions), [[Histoplasmosis]]. |
| **Immune/Autoimmune** | [[Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis]] (RAS), [[Behçet's syndrome]], [[Lichen planus]] (erosive type), [[Pemphigus vulgaris]], [[Mucous membrane pemphigoid]], [[Erythema multiforme]], [[Lupus erythematosus]]. |
| **Trauma** | **Physical:** Cheek bite, jagged tooth, ill-fitting denture, toothbrush injury.<br>**Chemical:** Aspirin burn, silver nitrate, phenol.<br>**Thermal:** Hot food or fluids, reverse smoking. |
| **Neoplasms** | [[Squamous cell carcinoma]], Malignancy of minor salivary glands, [[Non-Hodgkin lymphoma]], [[Kaposi's sarcoma]]. |
| **Systemic/Blood Disorders** | [[Leukemia]], [[Agranulocytosis]], [[Pancytopenia]], [[Cyclic neutropenia]], [[Sickle cell anemia]], Vitamin deficiencies (B12, Folate, Iron), [[Crohn's disease]]. |
| **Drug Allergy** | Systemic administration (penicillin, tetracycline, sulfa drugs, phenytoin) or local contact stomatitis. |

### Clinical Examination of an Ulcer

The inspection and palpation of an ulcer provide critical diagnostic clues.

#### 1. Edge of the Ulcer
The edge often indicates the underlying pathology:
*   **Inflamed/Edematous:** Spreading acute infection.
*   **Undermined:** characteristic of [[Tuberculosis]] (TB).
*   **Punched out:** Seen in [[Gumma]] (Syphilis) or deep trophic ulcers (e.g., Behçet's).
*   **Sloping:** Indicates a healing ulcer.
*   **Raised and beaded:** [[Rodent ulcer]] (Basal cell carcinoma).
*   **Rolled out (Everted):** [[Squamous cell carcinoma]] (SCC) or ulcerated adenocarcinoma.

> Cross-sections of ulcer edges: Undermined (TB), Punched out (Syphilis), Rolled out/Everted (Malignancy), Sloping (Healing)

#### 2. Floor of the Ulcer
The exposed surface (what you see inside the ulcer):
*   **Red granulation tissue:** Healthy/healing.
*   **Pale/Smooth granulation:** Slowly healing.
*   **Wash leather slough:** Gummatous ulcer (Syphilis).
*   **Greyish/Necrotic slough:** Malignancy or Vincent's angina.

#### 3. Base of the Ulcer
The tissue on which the ulcer rests (assessed by palpation):
*   **Marked Induration (Hardness):** A hallmark feature of **Malignancy**.
*   **Soft:** Usually benign or inflammatory.

#### 4. Discharge
*   **Sero-sanguineous (blood-stained):** Tubercular or Malignant ulcers.
*   **Purulent:** Spreading infection.

### Specific Ulcerative Conditions

#### 1. Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis (RAS)
Also known as **Canker sores**. These are painful, recurrent, superficial ulcers affecting moveable mucosa.

*   **Etiology:** Unknown (multifactorial). Associated with stress, trauma, vitamin deficiency (B12, Folate, Iron), food allergy, or hormonal changes.
*   **Sites:** **Non-keratinized/Movable mucosa** (lips, buccal mucosa, floor of mouth, soft palate). Spares the hard palate and gingiva.
*   **Appearance:** Central necrotic area covered by a yellow-white membrane surrounded by a red erythematous halo.

**Clinical Forms of Aphthous Ulcers**

| Feature | **Minor Aphthous** | **Major Aphthous** | **Herpetiform** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frequency** | Most common (80-85%) | Less common (10-15%) | Least common (5%) |
| **Size** | 2–10 mm | > 10 mm (large) | Pinhead to 2 mm |
| **Number** | Multiple (1-5) | Usually single (1-10) | Multiple (up to 100) |
| **Duration** | 7–14 days | Weeks to months | 7–14 days |
| **Healing** | Without scarring | **Heals with scarring** | Without scarring |
| **Pain** | Moderate | Very painful | Moderate |

**Treatment:** Topical steroids, cauterization (silver nitrate), tetracycline mouth rinses, levamisole.

#### 2. Herpes Simplex Infection
Caused by [[Herpes Simplex Virus]] (HSV-1).

*   **Primary Herpetic Gingivostomatitis:** 
    *   Affects children.
    *   Clusters of vesicles that rupture to form ulcers.
    *   Systemic symptoms: Fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy.
*   **Recurrent Intraoral Herpes:**
    *   Affects **Keratinized/Fixed mucosa** (Hard palate, attached gingiva). *Note: This distinguishes it from aphthous ulcers which affect non-keratinized mucosa.*
    *   Often unilateral.
*   **Herpes Labialis (Cold Sores):** Affects vermilion border of the lip.
*   **Treatment:** Acyclovir (systemic or topical), supportive care. Avoid steroids.

#### 3. Traumatic Ulcers
*   **Cause:** Physical (jagged tooth, ill-fitting denture), Chemical (aspirin burn), or Thermal injury.
*   **Features:** Single, painful, soft on palpation.
*   **Management:** Removal of the cause (e.g., extraction of tooth, denture correction). Biopsy if it persists >3 weeks to rule out cancer.

#### 4. Malignant Ulcers ([[Squamous Cell Carcinoma]])
*   **Location:** Lateral border of tongue (commonest), floor of mouth, alveolus.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Painless** initially (pain occurs late with nerve involvement).
    *   **Everted/Rolled out edges**.
    *   **Indurated** (hard) base.
    *   Bleeds on touch (friable).
    *   Associated cervical lymphadenopathy (often hard/fixed).
*   **Diagnosis:** Biopsy is mandatory for any ulcer persisting >3 weeks.

#### 5. Vincent's Infection (Acute Necrotizing Ulcerative Gingivitis - ANUG)
Also known as **Trench Mouth**.
*   **Organisms:** Symbiosis of *Fusiform bacillus* and *Borrelia vincenti* (Spirochete).
*   **Features:** Ulceration of interdental papillae spreading to gum margins. Covered by necrotic slough. Gingiva is red, edematous, and bleeds easily. Fetor oris (halitosis) is present.
*   **Treatment:** Systemic antibiotics (Metronidazole/Penicillin) and hydrogen peroxide mouthwashes.

#### 6. Syphilitic Ulcers
*   **Primary (Chancre):** Painless, indurated ulcer with "cartilaginous" feel. Unilateral. Associated with rubbery lymph nodes.
*   **Secondary:** **Snail track ulcers** and mucous patches. Highly infectious.
*   **Tertiary:** **Gumma**. Punched out ulcer with wash-leather slough. Often on the hard palate (can cause perforation).

#### 7. Tubercular Ulcers
*   Usually secondary to pulmonary TB.
*   **Features:** Undermined edges, pale granulation tissue, "mouse-nibbled" appearance. Very painful.
*   **Site:** Dorsum of tongue or tonsil.

#### 8. Vesiculobullous Lesions
*   **[[Pemphigus Vulgaris]]:** Intraepithelial cleavage (acantholysis). Bullae rupture easily leaving painful erosions. Positive **Nikolsky sign**.
*   **[[Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid]]:** Subepithelial cleavage. Bullae are thicker and may remain intact longer. Heals with scarring (can cause ocular blindness).

### Comparison: Aphthous vs. Herpetiform Ulcers vs. Herpes Simplex

| Feature | **Aphthous (Herpetiform type)** | **Herpes Simplex (Recurrent)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Site** | **Non-keratinized** mucosa (Soft palate, floor of mouth) | **Keratinized** mucosa (Hard palate, Gingiva) |
| **Vesicle Stage** | Absent | Present (vesicles rupture to form ulcers) |
| **Etiology** | Autoimmune/Unknown | Viral (HSV) |
| **Treatment** | Steroids | Antivirals (Acyclovir) |

### Clinical Implications & "Red Flags"
*   **Rule of thumb:** Any oral ulcer persisting for more than **3 weeks** requires a biopsy to rule out malignancy.
*   **Pain:** Malignant ulcers are often painless in early stages; Traumatic, Aphthous, and Tubercular ulcers are painful.
*   **Induration:** Hardness at the base suggests malignancy.
*   **Systemic Review:** Always check for genital ulcers (Behçet’s), skin rash (Lichen planus, Erythema multiforme), or GI symptoms (Crohn’s).
