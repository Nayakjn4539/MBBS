# [[NUTRITION AND HEALTH]] > A 5-year-old boy is taken to Paediatric OPD with night blindness and triangular pearly white foamy spots on bulbar conjunctiva. Which micronutrient is responsible? Describe symptoms and signs. How can the boy be treated? What are dietary sources? Briefly describe the National Health Program related to this.

### Diagnosis and Micronutrient
The clinical presentation of night blindness and **triangular pearly white foamy spots** on the bulbar conjunctiva is characteristic of [[Xerophthalmia]].

*   **Responsible Micronutrient:** [[Vitamin A]] (Retinol).
*   **Specific Sign Identified:** The spots described are **[[Bitot's Spots]]**.

### Symptoms and Signs (Clinical Features)
The clinical manifestations of [[Vitamin A Deficiency]] (VAD) are predominantly ocular and are collectively termed **Xerophthalmia**. The WHO classification (1982) is the standard for describing these stages:

| Code | Stage | Description | Clinical Relevance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **XN** | **Night Blindness** | Inability to see in dim light. | First clinical **symptom**. Often recognized by parents (local term often exists, e.g., *Ratoudhi*). |
| **X1A** | **Conjunctival Xerosis** | Conjunctiva becomes dry, non-wettable, muddy, and wrinkled. | First clinical **sign**. Looks like "sand banks at receding tide". |
| **X1B** | **Bitot’s Spots** | Triangular, pearly-white/yellowish, foamy/cheesy spots on bulbar conjunctiva lateral to cornea. | **Specific sign** found in young children indicating active deficiency. |
| **X2** | **Corneal Xerosis** | Cornea appears dull, dry, and non-wettable (hazy). | Indicates spread to the cornea; urgent attention needed. |
| **X3A** | **Corneal Ulceration** | Ulceration involving < 1/3 of the corneal surface. | Can heal but may leave scars. |
| **X3B** | **Keratomalacia** | Liquefaction (softening) of > 1/3 of cornea. | **Grave medical emergency**. Can lead to perforation and total blindness rapidly. |
| **XS** | **Corneal Scarring** | Opacities left after healing. | Causes permanent visual impairment. |
| **XF** | **Xerophthalmic Fundus** | Spotted appearance of fundus. | Seen in prolonged deficiency. |

**Extra-ocular Manifestations:**
*   **Phrynoderma** (Toad skin): Follicular hyperkeratosis (rough skin on shoulders/buttocks).
*   **Growth Retardation**.
*   **Increased susceptibility to infections** (Diarrhea, Respiratory infections, Measles).

> **Mnemonic for WHO Classification:**
> **N**o **C**ool **B**oy **C**an **K**eep **S**ecrets
> *   **N**ight blindness (XN)
> *   **C**onjunctival xerosis (X1A)
> *   **B**itot’s spots (X1B)
> *   **C**orneal xerosis (X2) / Ulcer (X3A)
> *   **K**eratomalacia (X3B)
> *   **S**carring (XS)

> Draw an eye showing a triangular foamy patch on the white part (sclera) lateral to the iris to represent Bitot's Spots

### Treatment of the Child (Therapeutic Schedule)
Since the child has active signs of [[Xerophthalmia]] (Bitot's spots), he requires **immediate therapeutic dosing** rather than just prophylaxis.

**1. Specific Treatment (Oral Vitamin A - Retinol Palmitate):**
The standard WHO treatment schedule for a child > 12 months (or > 8kg) is:
*   **Immediately on diagnosis (Day 0):** **200,000 IU** (International Units) orally.
*   **Next day (Day 1):** **200,000 IU** orally.
*   **Follow-up (Day 14 or 4 weeks later):** **200,000 IU** orally.

*Note: Since the child is 5 years old, he receives the full adult dose (2 lakh IU). If the child were < 6 months, the dose would be 50,000 IU; if 6-12 months, 100,000 IU.*

**2. Supportive Treatment:**
*   **Treat underlying infections:** Antibiotics if there is secondary bacterial infection (eye ointment) or systemic infections (measles/diarrhea).
*   **Nutritional Support:** High protein and calorie diet to treat concurrent [[Protein Energy Malnutrition]] (PEM).
*   **Protect the eye:** If corneal involvement is present, shield the eye to prevent rupture.

### Dietary Sources of Vitamin A
Vitamin A is available in two forms: **Retinol** (Preformed Vitamin A) and **Carotenoids** (Pro-vitamin A).

**1. Animal Sources (Retinol - High Bioavailability):**
*   **Fish Liver Oils:** Halibut liver oil (richest source), Cod liver oil, Shark liver oil.
*   **Animal Organs:** Liver (Ox, Sheep, Goat).
*   **Dairy/Poultry:** Egg yolk, Milk, Butter, Cheese, Ghee.

**2. Plant Sources (Beta-Carotene - Precursor):**
*   **Green Leafy Vegetables (GLVs):** Spinach (*Palak*), Amaranth (*Chaulai*), Drumstick leaves, Curry leaves. *The darker the green, the more the carotene.*
*   **Yellow/Orange Fruits & Vegetables:** Carrots (richest vegetable source), Papaya (ripe), Mango (ripe), Pumpkin.
*   **Red Palm Oil:** Very rich source.

**3. Fortified Foods:**
*   Vanaspati (Hydrogenated fat), Milk (fortified with Vit A & D).

### National Health Program
The relevant program is the **National Prophylaxis Programme against Nutritional Blindness due to Vitamin A Deficiency**, which operates under the umbrella of the [[National Health Mission]] (NHM) and [[RMNCH+A]] strategy.

**Objective:** To prevent blindness due to Vitamin A deficiency.

**Current Prophylaxis Schedule (Universal Immunization Program):**
A total of **9 doses** (Total 17 Lakh IU) are administered to all children under 5 years.

| Dose Number | Age | Dose Amount | Volume (Standard spoon) | Administered With |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1st Dose** | At **9 months** completed | **1,00,000 IU** | 1 ml (half spoon) | Measles-Rubella (MR-1) Vaccine |
| **2nd Dose** | At **16-24 months** | **2,00,000 IU** | 2 ml (one full spoon) | DPT/OPV Booster / MR-2 |
| **3rd to 9th Doses** | Every **6 months** up to 5 years | **2,00,000 IU** | 2 ml | Biannual rounds (often April/Oct) |

*   **Administration:** The solution is an oil-based preparation dispensed using a specific plastic spoon (2 ml capacity) supplied with the bottle.
*   **Target:** Reduce the prevalence of blindness to < 0.3%.
