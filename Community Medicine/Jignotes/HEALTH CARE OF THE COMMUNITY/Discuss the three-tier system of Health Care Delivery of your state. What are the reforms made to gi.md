# [[HEALTH CARE OF THE COMMUNITY]] > Discuss the three-tier system of Health Care Delivery of your state. What are the reforms made to give better service to people? Discuss the role of Private Partner Partnership (PPP) in efficient delivery of health services.

### Three-Tier System of Health Care Delivery

In India, the health care delivery system is organized based on the recommendations of the **Bhore Committee** (1946) and subsequent planning commissions. It follows a hierarchal **Three-Tier Structure** to ensure optimal utilization of resources and effective referral linkages.

> Draw a pyramid with three levels. Base: Primary Level (SC/PHC), Middle: Secondary Level (CHC/District Hospital), Apex: Tertiary Level (Medical Colleges/Specialized Institutes). Arrows showing referral upwards and support downwards.

#### 1. Primary Level of Health Care
This is the **first level of contact** between the individual/community and the health system. It brings health care as close as possible to where people live and work.
*   **Focus:** [[Primary Health Care]] (preventive, promotive, and basic curative services).
*   **Infrastructure:**
    *   **[[Sub-Centre]] (SC):** The most peripheral outpost.
        *   **Population Norm:** 1 per 5,000 (Plains); 1 per 3,000 (Hilly/Tribal areas).
        *   **Staff:** 3 (Health Worker Female/ANM, Health Worker Male, Voluntary worker).
        *   **Function:** MCH, Family planning, Immunization, Disease surveillance.
        *   *Update:* Now being upgraded to **Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs)**.
    *   **[[Primary Health Centre]] (PHC):** The first contact point with a qualified Medical Officer.
        *   **Population Norm:** 1 per 30,000 (Plains); 1 per 20,000 (Hilly/Tribal areas).
        *   **Staff:** Minimum 15 (includes Medical Officer, Lab Tech, Pharmacist).
        *   **Beds:** 4–6 beds.
        *   **Function:** Referral unit for 6 Sub-centres. Provides integrated curative and preventive care.

#### 2. Secondary Level of Health Care
This is the **First Referral Level**. It deals with more complex health problems that cannot be handled at the primary level.
*   **Infrastructure:**
    *   **[[Community Health Centre]] (CHC):**
        *   **Population Norm:** 1 per 1,20,000 (Plains); 1 per 80,000 (Hilly/Tribal areas).
        *   **Staff:** 30–31 (includes 4 Specialists: Surgeon, Physician, OBG, Paediatrician).
        *   **Beds:** 30 beds.
        *   **Function:** Acts as a referral center for 4 PHCs. Provides specialist care, X-ray, Lab, and Emergency services. Function as [[First Referral Units]] (FRUs).
    *   **District Hospitals (DH):** Provide comprehensive secondary care at the district level.

#### 3. Tertiary Level of Health Care
This is the **Second Referral Level**. It offers super-specialist care and sophisticated diagnostic/therapeutic facilities.
*   **Institutions:** Medical Colleges, Regional Hospitals, All India Institutes (e.g., AIIMS).
*   **Functions:**
    *   Highly specialized care (Cardiology, Neurology, etc.).
    *   Planning and managerial skills.
    *   Teaching and training of specialized staff.
    *   Support to primary and secondary levels.

### Reforms to Improve Service Delivery

To bridge the gaps in the healthcare system and achieve "Health for All," the government has introduced several structural and functional reforms:

**1. [[National Health Mission]] (NHM)**
   *   Launched to provide accessible, affordable, and quality health care.
   *   Includes **NRHM** (Rural) and **NUHM** (Urban).
   *   **Focus:** Decentralized planning (District Action Plans), flexible financing, and reducing out-of-pocket expenditure.

**2. [[Ayushman Bharat Programme]]**
   *   **Pillar 1: Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs):** Transforming 1.5 lakh SCs and PHCs into HWCs to provide **Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC)** covering NCDs, mental health, and geriatrics, not just MCH.
   *   **Pillar 2: [[Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana]] (PM-JAY):** Provides health insurance cover of Rs. 5 Lakhs per family/year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization to vulnerable families.

**3. Creation of [[ASHA]] (Accredited Social Health Activist)**
   *   A trained female community health activist selected from the village itself (1 per 1000 population).
   *   Acts as a bridge/interface between the community and the public health system.

**4. [[Indian Public Health Standards]] (IPHS)**
   *   Codified standards for infrastructure, manpower, drugs, and equipment for SCs, PHCs, CHCs, and District Hospitals to ensure quality of care.

**5. Rogi Kalyan Samitis (RKS) / Hospital Management Societies**
   *   Registered societies to manage hospital affairs, ensuring community participation and accountability. They utilize user charges for hospital improvement.

**6. [[Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram]] (JSSK)**
   *   Ensures **zero out-of-pocket expense** for pregnant women and sick infants (up to 1 year) in public health facilities (Free drugs, diet, diagnostics, and transport).

**7. Mainstreaming of [[AYUSH]]**
   *   Co-location of AYUSH facilities at PHCs, CHCs, and District Hospitals to provide a choice of treatment systems to patients.

### Role of Private Partner Partnership (PPP) in Health Services

Given the resource constraints of the public sector and the wide reach of the private sector, PPPs are essential for efficient delivery.

**Definition:** A formal relationship between the public and private sectors to deliver health services, sharing risks, responsibilities, and resources.

**Key Roles and Models of PPP:**

| Role/Function | Description & Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Outsourcing Support Services** | Government hospitals outsource non-clinical services like laundry, diet/kitchen, security, and bio-medical waste management to private agencies to improve efficiency. |
| **Diagnostic Services** | contracting private labs for CT scans, MRI, or advanced pathology where government facilities are lacking (e.g., **Tele-radiology**). |
| **Emergency Transport** | The **"Dial 108"** ambulance service in many states is a classic PPP model (Govt funds, Private partner manages operations). |
| **National Health Programs** | Involvement of private doctors in [[RNTCP]]/[[NTEP]] (TB control) for DOTS provision and in [[NLEP]] (Leprosy) for reconstructive surgeries. |
| **Social Marketing** | Selling health products (Condoms, OCPs, ORS) at subsidized rates through private retail outlets to increase reach. |
| **Mobile Health Units (MMUs)** | NGOs or private partners run MMUs in tribal/remote areas with government funding to reach the unreached. |
| **Super-Specialty Care** | Government provides land/concessions; private partner builds and runs the hospital, providing a % of beds/services free to poor patients (e.g., Apollo, Fortis models in some states). |

**Benefits of PPP:**
*   **Efficiency:** Reduces waiting time and improves service quality.
*   **Reach:** Utilizes the vast presence of private practitioners in urban and semi-urban areas.
*   **Technology:** Brings in advanced technology and managerial expertise.

> **Clinical Relevance:** A doctor at a PHC must know the referral chain (Three-tier system) to save a patient's life. For a high-risk pregnancy, referring to a CHC (FRU) with blood storage and C-section facility is vital, rather than sending them to another PHC. Similarly, utilizing PPP services (like 108 ambulance) ensures timely transport.

**Mnemonic for Reforms:** **"AN JAI"** (Like 'Anjai' - success)
*   **A** - Ayushman Bharat / ASHA
*   **N** - National Health Mission (NHM)
*   **J** - Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK)
*   **A** - AYUSH Mainstreaming
*   **I** - Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS)
