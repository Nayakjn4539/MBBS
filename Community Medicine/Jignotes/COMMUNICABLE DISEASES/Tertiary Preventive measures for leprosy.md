# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Tertiary Preventive measures for leprosy

### **Tertiary Prevention in [[Leprosy]]**

Tertiary prevention signifies intervention in the **[[Late Pathogenesis Phase]]** of the disease process. The primary goal is to reduce or limit impairments and disabilities, minimize suffering caused by existing departures from good health, and promote the patient's adjustment to irremediable conditions.

It consists of two major modes of intervention: **[[Disability Limitation]]** and **[[Rehabilitation]]**.

---

### 1. Disability Limitation
This intervention aims to prevent the transition of the disease process from **[[Impairment]]** (loss of structure/function) to **[[Handicap]]** (social disadvantage).

**Key Measures:**
*   **Care of Hands and Feet:**
    *   Regular inspection and care of dry, denervated skin of palms and soles.
    *   Soaking feet in water to hydrate and applying oil to retain moisture to prevent cracks and fissures.
    *   Healing of wounds, ulcers, and skin cracks.
*   **Protective Gear:**
    *   Use of protective gloves for hands to prevent thermal or mechanical injuries due to loss of sensation.
    *   Use of **[[Micro-cellular rubber (MCR) footwear]]** to protect insensitive feet and prevent plantar ulcers.
*   **Prevention of Joint Stiffness:**
    *   Physiotherapy and exercises to prevent contractures in cases of paralytic deformities.
    *   Splinting to rest affected nerves and prevent contractures.
*   **Eye Care:**
    *   Protection of eyes in cases of **[[Lagophthalmos]]** (inability to close eyes) to prevent exposure keratitis and corneal ulcers.
    *   Use of goggles and regular eye hygiene.

> **Clinical Relevance:** The sequence of events leading to handicap is:
> **Disease $\rightarrow$ [[Impairment]] $\rightarrow$ [[Disability]] $\rightarrow$ [[Handicap]]**.
> Tertiary prevention aims to break this chain at the later stages.

### 2. Rehabilitation
Rehabilitation is the combined and coordinated use of medical, social, educational, and vocational measures for training and retraining the individual to the highest possible level of functional ability.

**Components of Rehabilitation:**

#### A. Medical Rehabilitation (Restoration of Function)
*   **[[Reconstructive Surgery]] (RCS):** Surgical correction of deformities such as claw hand, foot drop, and lagophthalmos to restore function and appearance.
*   **Incentives:** Under the **[[National Leprosy Eradication Programme]] (NLEP)**, a welfare allowance (e.g., Rs 8,000) is provided to patients from BPL families undergoing major reconstructive surgery to compensate for loss of wages.
*   **Prosthetics:** Provision of artificial limbs and orthopaedic devices for those with lost digits or limbs.

#### B. Vocational Rehabilitation (Earning a Livelihood)
*   Training the individual to earn a livelihood despite the disability.
*   Teaching skills suited to their physical limitations (e.g., tailoring, weaving, or running small shops) so they are not a burden on society.
*   **Ideally:** "Work with what is left".

#### C. Social Rehabilitation (Social Integration)
*   Restoration of family and social relationships.
*   Combating **[[Stigma]]** and social ostracism associated with the disease.
*   Preventing "Dehabilitation" (rejection by society) is often cheaper and more effective than later rehabilitation.

#### D. Psychological Rehabilitation
*   Restoration of personal dignity and confidence.
*   Counseling to help the patient adjust to the physical changes and social challenges.

### **Summary of Common Deformities & Management**

| Site of Deformity | Clinical Manifestation | Tertiary Management/Correction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Face** | **[[Lagophthalmos]]**, Facial Palsy, loss of eyebrows (**[[Madarosis]]**) | Temporalis muscle transfer, eyebrow grafting, plastic surgery. |
| **Hands** | **[[Claw Hand]]**, Wrist drop, absorption of digits | Tendon transfer surgeries, physiotherapy, protective gloves. |
| **Feet** | **[[Foot Drop]]**, Plantar ulcers, Claw toes | Tibialis posterior transfer, **[[MCR Footwear]]**, plaster casts for ulcers. |

---

### **Community-Based Rehabilitation (CBR)**
*   CBR is a strategy within community development for the rehabilitation, equalization of opportunities, and social inclusion of people with disabilities.
*   It involves the combined efforts of people with disabilities, their families, communities, and health services.
*   **Self-Care Groups:** Promoting home-based self-care and peer support to prevent worsening of disabilities.

### **Mnemonic for Rehabilitation Types**

**"M V P S"** (Like Most Valuable Player)

*   **M** - **M**edical (Surgery, Prosthetics)
*   **V** - **V**ocational (Job training, financial independence)
*   **P** - **P**sychological (Confidence, dignity)
*   **S** - **S**ocial (Family acceptance, removing stigma)
