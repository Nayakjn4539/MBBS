### Classification of Epidemiological Studies

Epidemiological studies are broadly classified into two main categories: **Observational** and **Experimental** studies. These methods complement each other to understand disease distribution and causation,.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> A flowchart showing the classification tree starting with "Epidemiological Studies" branching into "Observational" and "Experimental", and then further subdividing as listed below.

**1. Observational Studies**
In these studies, the investigator allows nature to take its own course. The researcher **observes** and measures but does not intervene,.

*   **A. [[Descriptive Epidemiology]]:**
    *   Describes the distribution of disease or health-related events in a population.
    *   Focuses on **Time, Place, and Person** distribution,.
    *   Main goal: **Formulation of a hypothesis**.
    *   *Examples:* Case reports, Case series.

*   **B. [[Analytical Epidemiology]]:**
    *   Analyzes relationships between health status and other variables to test hypotheses.
    *   Main goal: **Hypothesis testing**.
    *   *Types:*
        1.  **[[Ecological Study]] (Correlational):** Unit of study is a **Population**.
        2.  **[[Cross-sectional Study]] (Prevalence study):** Unit of study is an **Individual**. Measures exposure and outcome at the same time (Snapshot),.
        3.  **[[Case-Control Study]] (Retrospective):** Proceeds from **Effect to Cause**. Compares diseased (cases) vs. non-diseased (controls).
        4.  **[[Cohort Study]] (Prospective):** Proceeds from **Cause to Effect**. Follows exposed vs. non-exposed groups over time,.

**2. Experimental Studies (Intervention Studies)**
The investigator has direct control over the conditions and **intervenes** or manipulates a variable (e.g., giving a drug or vaccine),.

*   **A. [[Randomized Controlled Trials]] (RCT):** Unit of study is **Patients** (e.g., Clinical trials).
*   **B. [[Field Trials]]:** Unit of study is **Healthy People** (e.g., Vaccine trials).
*   **C. [[Community Trials]]:** Unit of study is **Communities** (e.g., Fluoridation of water).

### Time Trends in Disease Occurrence

Epidemiologists identify fluctuations in disease occurrence over time to understand the source or aetiology.

#### 1. [[Cyclic Trend]] (Periodic Fluctuation)
*   **Definition:** These are recurrent fluctuations in disease occurrence spread over short periods of time, which may be days, weeks, months, or years.
*   **Mechanism:** In infectious diseases, these cycles are often due to naturally occurring variations in **[[herd immunity]]**. A build-up of susceptibles is required in the "herd" (population) before another outbreak can occur,.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Measles:** Historically appeared in cycles every **2–3 years**,.
    *   **Rubella:** Epidemics occurred every **6–9 years**.
    *   **Influenza:** Pandemics occur at intervals of **7–10 years** due to antigenic variation,.
    *   **Non-infectious:** Automobile accidents are more frequent on weekends (weekly cycle).

#### 2. [[Secular Trend]] (Long-term Trend)
*   **Definition:** This implies changes in the occurrence of disease (progressive increase or decrease) over a **long period of time**, generally several years or decades,.
*   **Interpretation:** It indicates a consistent tendency to change in a particular direction. It may reflect changes in the agent, host, environmental factors, or changes in diagnosis and reporting standards.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Decreasing Trend:** Communicable diseases like [[Polio]], Diphtheria, Tuberculosis, and Typhoid have shown a consistent decline in developed countries,.
    *   **Increasing Trend:** Non-communicable diseases (Modern Epidemics) like **[[Coronary Heart Disease]]**, Lung Cancer, and Diabetes have shown a consistent upward trend,.

### [[Confounding]] in Epidemiological Studies

**Definition:**
Confounding is a situation where the association between an exposure and a disease is distorted by the presence of a third factor (the **confounding variable**),.

**Criteria for a Confounding Factor:**
For a variable to be a confounder, it must satisfy two conditions,:
1.  It must be **associated with the exposure** under investigation.
2.  It must be **associated with the disease** (independently be a risk factor for the disease).
3.  It must be **unequally distributed** between the study and control groups.

**Clinical Example:**
In a study evaluating the role of **[[Alcohol]]** in the aetiology of **[[Oesophageal Cancer]]**:
*   **Smoking** acts as a confounding factor.
*   *Reason:* Smoking is associated with alcohol consumption (people who drink often smoke) AND smoking is an independent risk factor for oesophageal cancer.
*   If we do not adjust for smoking, the risk attributed to alcohol may actually be due to the effects of smoking.

**Methods to Control Confounding:**
Confounding can be controlled during the design or analysis stage:
1.  **[[Randomization]]:** The most ideal method; distributes known and unknown confounders equally,.
2.  **[[Restriction]]:** Limiting the study to people with specific characteristics.
3.  **[[Matching]]:** Selecting controls that are similar to cases in specific variables (e.g., age-matching).
4.  **Stratification:** Analyzing data in subgroups.
5.  **Statistical Modeling:** Multivariate analysis.
