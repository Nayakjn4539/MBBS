# [[Concept Of Health And Disease]] > Modes of Intervention

### Modes of Intervention

Intervention is defined as any attempt to intervene or interrupt the usual sequence in the development of disease in man. There are five modes of intervention which form a continuum corresponding to the natural history of disease.

> Natural History of Disease and Levels of Prevention showing the relationship between Pre-pathogenesis/Pathogenesis phases and the 5 modes of intervention

The five modes of intervention corresponding to the levels of prevention are:

| Level of Prevention | Mode of Intervention | Phase of Disease | Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Prevention** | 1. **Health Promotion**<br>2. **Specific Protection** | Pre-pathogenesis (Risk factors present, disease absent) | Healthy individuals / Total population |
| **Secondary Prevention** | 3. **Early Diagnosis and Treatment** | Pathogenesis (Early stage) | Patients (Sub-clinical or early clinical) |
| **Tertiary Prevention** | 4. **Disability Limitation**<br>5. **Rehabilitation** | Pathogenesis (Late stage) | Patients with advanced disease/disability |

### 1. Health Promotion
This is the process of enabling people to increase control over and to improve health. It is not directed against any single specific disease but is intended to strengthen the host through a variety of approaches.

**Key Interventions:**
*   **[[Health Education]]:** The most cost-effective intervention. It changes knowledge, feelings, and behavior. Targets include the general public, patients, and community leaders.
*   **Environmental Modifications:** Provision of safe water, sanitary latrines, and insect/rodent control. These are non-clinical measures.
*   **Nutritional Interventions:** Includes food fortification, child feeding programs, and nutrition education to improve vulnerable groups.
*   **Lifestyle and Behavioral Changes:** Action depends on individual and community responsibility to change habits like smoking, sedentary lifestyle, etc.

### 2. Specific Protection
This includes measures applicable to particular diseases or groups of diseases to block known causes. It is applied when the risk of disease is present but the disease has not yet occurred.

**Key Interventions:**
*   **[[Immunization]]:** E.g., Vaccines for Polio, Measles, DPT.
*   **Use of Specific Nutrients:** E.g., Vitamin A prophylaxis for children.
*   **Chemoprophylaxis:** E.g., Doxycycline for malaria travelers.
*   **Protection against Occupational Hazards:** E.g., Helmets, earplugs, masks.
*   **Protection against Accidents.**
*   **Protection from Carcinogens/Allergens.**
*   **Control of Environmental Quality:** Air pollution, noise control, food safety.

### 3. Early Diagnosis and Treatment
This acts as the main intervention for **[[Disease Control]]**. It attempts to arrest the disease process at an incipient stage, prevent complications, and reverse communicability.

**Objectives:**
*   To shorten the period of communicability (reducing the reservoir of infection).
*   To reduce mortality and morbidity.
*   To prevent the occurrence of secondary cases.

**Examples:**
*   **Screening:** Pap smear for cervical cancer.
*   **Case Finding:** Sputum smears for [[Tuberculosis]] (DOTS).
*   **Contact Tracing:** In STDs and HIV.
*   **Mass Treatment:** In Trachoma and Filaria control.

> **Clinical Relevance:** Early diagnosis is like stamping out the "spark" rather than calling the fire brigade to put out the fire.

### 4. Disability Limitation
When the disease has advanced beyond the early stages, the intervention mode shifts to disability limitation. The objective is to prevent or halt the transition of the disease process from **impairment** to **handicap**.

**Sequence of Events:**
1.  **Disease:** The intrinsic pathology/disorder (e.g., Accident).
2.  **Impairment:** Loss/abnormality of psychological, physiological, or anatomical structure (e.g., Loss of a foot).
3.  **Disability:** Restriction or lack of ability to perform an activity in a normal manner (e.g., Cannot walk).
4.  **Handicap:** Disadvantage resulting from impairment/disability that limits the fulfillment of a role (e.g., Unemployed).

> **Mnemonic:** **DID-H** (Disease $\rightarrow$ Impairment $\rightarrow$ Disability $\rightarrow$ Handicap)

**Intervention Strategy:** Intensive treatment to neutralize the disease process and prevent further damage (e.g., treating a leprosy patient to prevent plantar ulcers).

### 5. Rehabilitation
Defined as the combined and coordinated use of medical, social, educational, and vocational measures for training and retraining the individual to the highest possible level of functional ability.

**Types of Rehabilitation:**
1.  **Medical Rehabilitation:** Restoration of function (e.g., Prosthetics, reconstructive surgery in leprosy).
2.  **Vocational Rehabilitation:** Restoration of the capacity to earn a livelihood (e.g., training a blind person for suitable jobs).
3.  **Social Rehabilitation:** Restoration of family and social relationships.
4.  **Psychological Rehabilitation:** Restoration of personal dignity and confidence.

**Clinical Relevance:**
Rehabilitation should start very early in the process of medical treatment. It is no longer looked upon as an extracurricular activity of the physician. The goal is to make productive people out of non-productive people.
