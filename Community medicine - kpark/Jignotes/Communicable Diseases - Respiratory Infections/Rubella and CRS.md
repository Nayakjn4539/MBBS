# Rubella (German Measles)

Rubella, often called **German Measles** or **3-day Measles**, is an acute viral infection that is generally mild in children but has disastrous consequences if acquired by pregnant women, leading to [[Congenital Rubella Syndrome]] (CRS).

### 1. Epidemiological Determinants

#### Agent Factors
*   **Agent:** [[Rubella virus]], an RNA virus belonging to the **Togavirus** family.
*   **Serotype:** Only one antigenic type exists.
*   **Viability:** The virus is heat labile and rapidly inactivated by chemical agents, low pH, heat, and UV light.

#### Host Factors
*   **Natural Host:** **Humans** are the only known reservoir.
*   **Carrier State:** There is **no carrier state** for postnatally acquired rubella. However, infants with [[Congenital Rubella Syndrome]] (CRS) may shed the virus for months (up to 12-18 months) acting as a reservoir.
*   **Immunity:** A single attack confers **lifelong immunity**.
*   **Age:** Commonly affects children (3–10 years) and adolescents.
*   **Susceptibility:** About 40% of women of reproductive age in India are estimated to be susceptible (seronegative).

#### Environmental Factors
*   **Seasonality:** More common in winter and spring.
*   **Crowding:** Epidemics occur at intervals of 5–9 years in pre-vaccination eras.

### 2. Transmission Dynamics

*   **Mode of Transmission:**
    *   **Droplet infection:** From nose and throat secretions.
    *   **Vertical transmission:** Transplacental spread from infected mother to fetus (Teratogenic).
*   **Portal of Entry:** Respiratory tract.
*   **Incubation Period:** **14 to 21 days** (Average 18 days).
*   **Period of Communicability:** Highly infectious. Patients are infective from **1 week before** symptoms to **1 week after** the appearance of the rash.

### 3. Clinical Features (Postnatal Rubella)

The disease is often mild or subclinical (20-50% cases).

*   **Prodrome:** Low-grade fever, coryza, and sore throat (mild compared to measles).
*   **Lymphadenopathy:** Tender enlargement of **Post-auricular** and **Sub-occipital** lymph nodes. This is a very characteristic feature appearing 5-10 days before the rash.
*   **Rash:**
    *   Fine, pink, discrete **maculopapular rash**.
    *   Starts on the face and spreads rapidly to the trunk and extremities.
    *   Disappears by the **3rd day** (hence called "3-day measles").
    *   Leaves no staining or desquamation (unlike measles).
*   **Forchheimer’s spots:** Small red papules on the soft palate (seen in 20% of cases).
*   **Complications in Adults:** **Arthralgia** and arthritis (common in women), thrombocytopenic purpura, and rarely encephalitis.

> *   **L**ymphadenopathy (Sub-occipital)
> *   **L**ow grade fever
> *   **A**rthralgia (in adult women)

### 4. Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS)

This is the most significant public health concern associated with Rubella.

*   **Risk:** The earlier in pregnancy infection occurs, the greater the damage.
    *   **1st Trimester:** Maximum risk (up to 90%). "Most Disastrous Time".
    *   **>20 Weeks:** Risk of defects is negligible.
*   **Classical Triad of CRS (Gregg's Triad):**
    1.  **Deafness:** Sensorineural (Most common sequelae).
    2.  **Cardiac Malformations:** [[Patent Ductus Arteriosus]] (PDA) is most common, followed by Pulmonary Stenosis.
    3.  **Cataracts:** Pearly white nuclear cataract (often bilateral) and Microphthalmia.

*   **Other Manifestations:**
    *   **"Blueberry Muffin" rash** (due to thrombocytopenic purpura/extramedullary hematopoiesis).
    *   Microcephaly and mental retardation.
    *   Hepatosplenomegaly.
    *   Low birth weight.

### 5. Diagnosis

*   **Clinical:** Difficult due to mild nature; lymphadenopathy is a clue.
*   **Serology (Gold Standard):**
    *   **IgM ELISA:** Presence of Rubella-specific IgM indicates recent infection.
    *   **Four-fold rise in IgG titer:** Between acute and convalescent sera (taken 2 weeks apart).
*   **Diagnosis of CRS:**
    *   Presence of IgM antibodies in the newborn (IgM does not cross the placenta, so its presence implies fetal production).
    *   Persistence of IgG antibodies beyond 6 months of age (maternal IgG wanes by then).
    *   Isolation of virus from throat swabs, urine, or CSF of the infant.

### 6. Prevention and Immunization

#### Vaccination
*   **Type:** Live Attenuated Vaccine.
*   **Strain:** **RA 27/3** (grown on human diploid cells).
*   **Dose & Route:** 0.5 ml, Subcutaneous (SC).
*   **Efficacy:** Single dose gives >95% long-lasting immunity.
*   **Schedule (India - NIS):**
    *   Administered as **MR (Measles-Rubella)** or **MMR** vaccine.
    *   **1st Dose:** At 9-12 months completed age.
    *   **2nd Dose:** At 16-24 months.

#### Contraindications
*   **Pregnancy:** It is a **Live Vaccine**. Theoretical risk of teratogenicity.
    *   *Clinical Relevance:* Women of reproductive age receiving the vaccine must be advised to avoid pregnancy for **1 month** (previously 3 months) following vaccination. However, inadvertent vaccination during pregnancy is *not* an indication for medical termination of pregnancy (MTP).
*   Severe immunosuppression (except asymptomatic HIV).

#### Strategy for Elimination
*   **Goal:** Elimination of Rubella and control of CRS.
*   **Target Population:**
    1.  **Infants/Children:** Routine immunization (MR vaccine) to stop viral circulation.
    2.  **Reproductive Age Women (15-49 years):** To prevent CRS immediately.
    3.  **Catch-up campaigns:** Targeting children 9 months to 15 years.
