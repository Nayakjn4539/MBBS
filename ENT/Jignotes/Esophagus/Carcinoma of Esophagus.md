# Carcinoma of Esophagus

## Introduction
Esophageal cancer is a serious malignancy with a poor prognosis, often diagnosed at late stages. The incidence is high in China, Japan, USSR, and South Africa. In India, it constitutes a significant percentage of all body cancers.

## Etiology and Risk Factors
The risk factors vary depending on the histological type ([[Squamous cell carcinoma]] vs [[Adenocarcinoma]]).

**Mnemonic for Risk Factors: "ABCDEF"**
*   **A**lcohol & **A**chalasia
*   **B**arrett’s esophagus (for Adenocarcinoma)
*   **C**igarettes (Smoking) & **C**orrosive injury
*   **D**iet (Nitrosamines/low fiber) & **D**iverticula
*   **E**sophageal webs ([[Plummer-Vinson syndrome]])
*   **F**amilial (Tylosis)

### Comparison of Risk Factors by Type

| Feature | [[Squamous Cell Carcinoma]] (SCC) | [[Adenocarcinoma]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Incidence** | Most common type (93%) | Increasing incidence (3%) |
| **Site** | Proximal 2/3rd of esophagus | Distal 1/3rd and [[Gastroesophageal junction]] |
| **Demographics** | More common in Black males | More common in White males |
| **Key Risk Factors** | • Smoking and Alcohol<br>• Chewing Paan/Tobacco/Sopari<br>• Diet rich in nitrates/pickles<br>• [[Human papillomavirus]] | • [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD)<br>• [[Barrett's esophagus]]<br>• [[Hiatus hernia]]<br>• Obesity |
| **Pre-existing Lesions** | • [[Benign strictures]]<br>• [[Achalasia cardia]]<br>• [[Plummer-Vinson syndrome]]<br>• Corrosive injury<br>• [[Tylosis]] | • [[Barrett's esophagus]] (Metaplasia) |

**Clinical Implication:** Prior head and neck cancer increases the risk of esophageal [[Squamous cell carcinoma]] eightfold.

## Pathology
### Gross Appearance
The tumor may present in three forms:
1.  **Ulcerative:** Most common; causes bleeding.
2.  **Proliferative (Exophytic):** Fungating mass filling the lumen.
3.  **Infiltrative:** Spreads submucosally; causes strictures.
    *   **Annular growth:** Produces early obstruction.

### Modes of Spread
Because the esophagus lacks a serosal layer, mucosal cancer disseminates rapidly.

1.  **Direct Spread:**
    *   Infiltrates esophageal wall.
    *   Invades trachea, left bronchus, aorta, or pericardium.
    *   Involvement of [[Recurrent laryngeal nerve]] causes vocal cord paralysis.
2.  **Lymphatic Spread:**
    *   **Cervical esophagus:** Cervical nodes.
    *   **Thoracic esophagus:** Mediastinal nodes.
    *   **Lower esophagus:** Celiac nodes/Upper abdominal nodes.
    *   **Skip Lesions:** Spread through submucosal lymphatics can cause metastasis away from the primary tumor.
3.  **Hematogenous Spread:**
    *   Liver, lungs, bone, and brain.

## Clinical Features
Most patients present late. Symptoms typically appear when the lumen is significantly compromised.

*   **[[Dysphagia]]:**
    *   Most common symptom.
    *   **Progressive:** First to solids, then to liquids.
    *   Sudden impaction of food (bolus obstruction) may be the first sign.
*   **Weight loss and Emaciation:** Due to poor intake and cancer cachexia.
*   **Pain:**
    *   Retrosternal discomfort or burning (early).
    *   Pain referred to the back indicates extra-esophageal spread.
*   **Respiratory Symptoms:**
    *   Coughing/Choking: Suggests aspiration or [[Tracheoesophageal fistula]].
    *   Hoarseness: Due to recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement.
*   **Others:**
    *   Odynophagia (painful swallowing).
    *   Hypercalcemia (in some SCC cases).
    *   Regurgitation and foul breath (halitosis).

## Investigations

### 1. Barium Swallow
*   **Diagnostic Features:**
    *   **Rat-tail appearance:** Irregular filling defect with narrowing.
    *   **Apple-core appearance:** Circumferential mass causing narrowing.
    *   Irregular, ulcerated edges without proximal dilatation (unlike benign strictures).
    *   Shouldering effect at the margins.

### 2. Esophagoscopy (Endoscopy)
*   Useful to visualize the site and extent of the lesion.
*   **Biopsy:** Mandatory for histological confirmation.
*   Flexible fiber-optic esophagoscopy is preferred as it requires no general anesthesia.

### 3. CT Scan / MRI
*   Assesses extent of disease, mediastinal invasion, and nodal metastasis.
*   Essential for staging.

### 4. Bronchoscopy
*   To rule out invasion into the trachea and bronchi.

### 5. Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS)
*   Best for assessing the depth of invasion (T-stage).

## Staging (TNM Classification)
Based on AJCC/UICC:

| Stage | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Tumor (T)** | |
| **Tis** | [[Carcinoma in situ]] |
| **T1** | Invades lamina propria (T1a) or submucosa (T1b) |
| **T2** | Invades muscularis propria |
| **T3** | Invades adventitia |
| **T4** | Invades adjacent structures (pleura, pericardium, diaphragm, etc.) |
| **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)** | |
| **N0** | No regional lymph node metastasis |
| **N1** | Regional lymph node metastasis present |
| **Distant Metastasis (M)** | |
| **M0** | No distant metastasis |
| **M1** | Distant metastasis present |

## Treatment Management
Treatment depends on the location and stage of the tumor.

### 1. Curative Treatment
*   **Lower One-Third:**
    *   **Surgery:** [[Esophagogastrectomy]] is the preferred method.
    *   Involves excision of the affected segment with a wide margin and the fundus of the stomach, followed by primary reconstruction (Stomach pull-up).
*   **Upper Two-Thirds:**
    *   **Radiotherapy:** Preferred because surgery is difficult due to proximity to great vessels and mediastinal nodes.
*   **Middle One-Third:**
    *   Nonsurgical management with a full course of radiotherapy is often preferred.
*   **Early Stages (T1/T2, N0):** Surgery alone.
*   **Advanced Stages (T3 or N1):** Neoadjuvant chemotherapy/radiation followed by surgery.

### 2. Palliative Treatment
Indicated for advanced, inoperable lesions to restore swallowing and manage pain.
*   **Intubation/Stenting:** Insertion of [[Celestin tube]] or [[Mousseau-Barbin tube]] or self-expandable metal stents.
*   **Feeding procedures:** [[Gastrostomy]] or Jejunostomy for nutritional support.
*   **Laser Surgery:** Nd:YAG laser to burn tumor tissue and recanalize the lumen.
*   **Chemotherapy:** Palliative measure for disseminated disease (Cisplatin, 5-Fluorouracil).

## Prognosis
*   Generally poor due to late presentation.
*   5-year survival rate is approximately 5–10%.
