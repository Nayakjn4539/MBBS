# Persistent Hyperplastic Primary Vitreous (PHPV)

**Synonym:** [[Persistent Fetal Vasculature]] (PFV)

**Definition**
[[Persistent Hyperplastic Primary Vitreous]] (PHPV) is a congenital developmental anomaly caused by the failure of the **primary vitreous** and the [[hyaloid vascular system]] to regress during gestation,.
*   Normally, the hyaloid vessels and primary vitreous begin to involute in the 2nd month of gestation and disappear by the 8th month or shortly before birth, giving way to the secondary vitreous,.
*   In PHPV, these structures persist and undergo hyperplasia.

### Epidemiology and Associations
*   **Laterality:** Almost always **Unilateral** (90% of cases),.
*   **Eye Size:** Classically associated with **[[Microphthalmos]]** (small eye),,.
*   **Bilateral Cases:** Rare; usually associated with systemic syndromes such as:
    *   [[Trisomy 13]] (Patau syndrome).
    *   Trisomy 22.
    *   [[Norrie disease]].
    *   Walker-Warburg syndrome.

### Classification and Pathophysiology
PHPV is classified into Anterior, Posterior, or Combined forms based on the location of the remnant tissue.

#### 1. Anterior PHPV (Most Common)
Occurs when the remnant vascular stalk is attached to the posterior aspect of the [[lens]] but does not extend back to the optic nerve.
*   **Pathology:** A retrolental fibrovascular mass forms.
*   **Key Clinical Sign:** **Elongated [[ciliary processes]]** are stretched and inserted into the peripheral lens mass/retrolental tissue.
*   **Mechanism of Complications:**
    *   The retrolental mass contracts $\rightarrow$ Ciliary processes are pulled centrally and forward.
    *   This causes shallowing of the anterior chamber.
    *   Can lead to a tear in the posterior lens capsule $\rightarrow$ [[Cataract]] formation and lens swelling.
    *   Result: **[[Secondary angle-closure glaucoma]]**.

#### 2. Posterior PHPV
Occurs when the remnant vascular stalk arises from the [[optic nerve head]] but does not reach the lens.
*   **Pathology:** A white dense membrane or stalk extends from the optic disc to the peripheral retina or retrolental region.
*   **Key Clinical Sign:** A persistent [[hyaloid artery]] with a large stalk issuing from the optic disc.
*   **Complications:**
    *   Retinal folds (falciform folds).
    *   **[[Tractional retinal detachment]]** involving the posterior pole.
    *   Optic nerve hypoplasia or dysplasia.

### Clinical Features
The condition is usually noticed shortly after birth in a full-term infant.
*   **[[Leukocoria]]** (Amaurotic cat’s eye reflex/White pupillary reflex): The most common presenting feature,.
*   **[[Microphthalmos]]:** The eye is smaller than normal.
*   **Strabismus:** Often secondary to poor vision.
*   **Visual Acuity:** Usually poor prognosis.

### Complications
If left untreated, PHPV can lead to devastating ocular sequelae:
*   **Secondary [[Glaucoma]]:** Often angle-closure type due to anterior displacement of the lens-iris diaphragm or swelling of the lens.
*   **[[Cataract]]:** Secondary to posterior capsule rupture or metabolic disturbance.
*   **[[Intraocular hemorrhage]]:** Recurrent bleeding from the persistence of fetal vessels.
*   **[[Phthisis bulbi]]:** Atrophy and shrinkage of the globe.
*   **Retinal Detachment:** Tractional or exudative.

### Differential Diagnosis (The "Pseudogliomas")
PHPV is a major cause of **pseudoglioma** (conditions mimicking [[Retinoblastoma]]). Differentiating PHPV from Retinoblastoma (RB) is critical.

| Feature | PHPV (Persistent Fetal Vasculature) | [[Retinoblastoma]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Laterality** | Typically Unilateral (90%) | Unilateral or Bilateral (40% heritable) |
| **Eye Size** | **[[Microphthalmos]]** (Small eye) | Normal or Buphthalmic (Large eye) |
| **Calcification** | **Absent** (usually) | **Present** (Common) |
| **Ciliary Processes** | **Elongated** and visible | Normal |
| **Cataract** | Common (Posterior polar/Cortical) | Rare (unless advanced) |
| **Onset** | Present at birth (Congenital) | Infants/Young children |
| **USG B-Scan** | Retrolental membrane/stalk; Short axial length | Intraocular mass; **[[Calcification]]** shadow |

Other differentials include:
*   [[Retinopathy of Prematurity]] (ROP): History of prematurity, bilateral.
*   [[Congenital Cataract]]: No retrolental mass/stalk.
*   [[Toxocariasis]]: Ocular inflammation history.
*   [[Coats' Disease]]: Exudative retinopathy in young males.

### Diagnosis and Investigations
1.  **Clinical Examination:**
    *   Slit-lamp examination (under mydriasis) to visualize the retrolental mass and elongated ciliary processes.
    *   Indirect ophthalmoscopy to assess the posterior pole and optic disc stalk.
2.  **[[Ultrasonography]] (B-Scan):**
    *   Essential to detect the remnant vascular stalk.
    *   Confirms short axial length (microphthalmos).
    *   **Crucial to rule out calcification** (which would suggest Retinoblastoma).
3.  **Neuroimaging ([[CT Scan]]/[[MRI]]):**
    *   Used to confirm anatomy and exclude Retinoblastoma (calcification is seen on CT in 75% of Rb cases).
    *   Demonstrates the enhancing retrolental tissue and hyaloid remnant.
4.  **[[Fluorescein Angiography]] (IVFA):** Can demonstrate the vascular nature of the retrolental mass.

### Management
Visual prognosis is generally poor despite intervention. The goal is often to save the eye (prevent phthisis) and, in some cases, salvage ambulatory vision.

**1. Conservative Management**
*   Indicated if the lesion is mild and not threatening the eye integrity.
*   Observation for complications like glaucoma.

**2. Surgical Management**
*   **Indications:** Significant media opacity (cataract/retrolental mass), progressive glaucoma, or retinal detachment.
*   **Procedure:**
    *   **[[Pars Plana Lensectomy]]**: Removal of the lens.
    *   **Membranectomy**: Excision of the retrolental fibrovascular membrane.
    *   **Anterior [[Vitrectomy]]**: Removal of anterior vitreous and hyaloid stalk.
    *   **Haemostasis:** Intraoperative bleeding is a major challenge due to the vascular nature of the persistent hyaloid tissue.

**3. Visual Rehabilitation**
*   Correction of aphakia (contact lenses) and vigorous [[Amblyopia]] therapy (patching) are required post-surgery, though results vary.
