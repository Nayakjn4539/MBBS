# [[Pelvis And Hip]] > X-ray findings for pelvis and hip

### Radiological Anatomy of the Pelvis and Hip

The interpretation of a pelvic X-ray requires a systematic assessment of bony bony contours, joint congruity, and specific radiological reference lines. Below are the key structures, lines, and markers visible on standard Anterior-Posterior (AP) and specialized views.

#### 1. Bony Structures and Joints
When viewing an AP pelvis radiograph, the following anatomical entities must be identified to rule out fractures or dislocations.

*   **[[Pelvic Ring]] Components:**
    *   **[[Ilium]]:** Large wing-like bone; check the iliac crests for symmetry.
    *   **[[Ischium]]:** Inferior posterior portion; check the ischial tuberosity.
    *   **[[Pubis]]:** Anterior portion; check superior and inferior pubic rami.
    *   **[[Sacrum]]:** Triangular bone at the base of the spine; check arcuate lines (neuroforamina).
    *   **[[Coccyx]]:** Tailbone.
*   **Proximal Femur:**
    *   **[[Femoral Head]]:** Should be spherical and congruent with the acetabulum.
    *   **[[Femoral Neck]]:** Check for cortical continuity.
    *   **[[Greater Trochanter]]:** Lateral bony prominence.
    *   **[[Lesser Trochanter]]:** Medial bony prominence (posteriorly directed).
*   **Joints:**
    *   **[[Sacroiliac Joint]] (SI Joint):** Connection between sacrum and ilium.
    *   **[[Pubic Symphysis]]:** Midline cartilaginous joint between pubic bones.
    *   **[[Hip Joint]]:** Ball and socket joint between femoral head and acetabulum.

#### 2. Key Radiological Lines and Markers (Adult/Trauma)
These lines are critical for diagnosing [[Acetabular Fractures]], [[Hip Dislocations]], and [[Femoral Neck Fractures]].

| Line/Marker | Anatomical Description | Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Shenton's Line]]** | A continuous smooth curve drawn along the inferior border of the [[superior pubic ramus]] and the inferomedial border of the [[femoral neck]]. | **Disrupted/Broken:** Indicates [[Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip]] (DDH), [[Femoral Neck Fracture]], or [[Hip Dislocation]]. |
| **[[Iliopectineal Line]]** | A bony ridge on the inner surface of the ilium and pubis. | Represents the **Anterior Column** of the acetabulum. Disruption indicates an anterior column fracture. |
| **[[Ilioischial Line]]** | A radiographic line formed by the posterior portion of the quadrilateral plate. | Represents the **Posterior Column** of the acetabulum. Disruption indicates a posterior column fracture. |
| **[[Teardrop Sign]] (Radiographic U)** | A U-shaped shadow inferior to the acetabulum. Lateral wall = acetabular fossa; Medial wall = quadrilateral plate. | Landmark for the inferior limit of the acetabulum. Distortion suggests occult acetabular fracture or pelvic rotation. |
| **[[Sourcil]]** | The dense, sclerotic weight-bearing dome (roof) of the acetabulum. | Irregularity or flattening suggests degenerative changes ([[Osteoarthritis]]) or impaction fractures. |
| **Anterior Rim of Acetabulum** | A line tracing the anterior margin of the acetabulum. | Helps distinguish anterior wall fractures. |
| **Posterior Rim of Acetabulum** | A line tracing the posterior margin of the acetabulum (usually more lateral than the anterior rim). | Disruption usually indicates a **Posterior Wall Fracture** (common in dashboard injuries). |
| **[[Ward's Triangle]]** | A radiolucent area in the femoral neck between principal compressive, secondary compressive, and tensile trabeculae. | Enlargement or loss of definition indicates [[Osteoporosis]]. |

#### 3. Pediatric Hip Lines and Angles
These markers are essential for diagnosing [[Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip]] (DDH), [[Perthes' Disease]], and [[Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis]] (SCFE).

*   **[[Hilgenreiner’s Line]]**: A horizontal line drawn through the triradiate cartilages (the Y-shaped growth plate of the acetabulum).
*   **[[Perkin’s Line]]**: A vertical line drawn downward from the outer ossified margin of the acetabular roof, perpendicular to Hilgenreiner’s line.
    *   *Clinical Implication:* The femoral head should normally lie in the **inferomedial quadrant** formed by these two lines. In DDH, it migrates superolaterally.
*   **[[Acetabular Index]]**: The angle formed between the slope of the acetabular roof and Hilgenreiner’s line.
    *   *Normal:* <30° at birth, <20° by age 2.
    *   *Abnormal:* Increased angle indicates acetabular dysplasia.
*   **[[Von Rosen's Line]]**: With hips abducted 45°, a line drawn along the femoral shaft should bisect the acetabulum.
    *   *Abnormal:* In dislocation, the line passes above the acetabulum (projects to ASIS).
*   **[[Trethowan’s Line]] (Klein's Line)**: A line drawn along the superior border of the femoral neck on AP view.
    *   *Normal:* The line should cut through a portion of the lateral femoral epiphysis.
    *   *Abnormal:* In [[SCFE]], the line passes superior to the epiphysis (The epiphysis slips medially and posteriorly).
*   **[[Center-Edge Angle]] (CE Angle of Wiberg)**: Angle between a vertical line through the center of the femoral head and a line connecting the center to the acetabular edge.
    *   *Normal:* >25°.
    *   *Abnormal:* <20° indicates dysplasia.

#### 4. Trabecular Patterns (Singh Index)
The **[[Singh Index]]** is used to grade the severity of [[Osteoporosis]] based on the visibility of trabecular patterns in the proximal femur on an AP X-ray.

**Primary Groups of Trabeculae:**
1.  **Principal Compressive:** From medial calcar to upper weight-bearing surface of the head.
2.  **Principal Tensile:** From lateral cortex below greater trochanter arching across to the inferior head.

**Grading (6 to 1):**
*   **Grade 6:** All normal trabecular groups visible (Normal bone).
*   **Grade 5:** Principal tensile and principal compressive trabeculae are prominent; secondary compressive trabeculae (Ward's triangle) are gone.
*   **Grade 4:** Principal tensile trabeculae are reduced but traceable.
*   **Grade 3:** Break in continuity of principal tensile trabeculae.
*   **Grade 2:** Only principal compressive trabeculae stand out prominently.
*   **Grade 1:** Principal compressive trabeculae markedly reduced (Severe osteoporosis).

#### 5. Specific Pathological Findings/Signs

*   **[[Crescent Sign]]**: A subchondral radiolucent line in the femoral head seen on AP or Frog-leg lateral view.
    *   *Indication:* Characteristic of early [[Avascular Necrosis]] (Osteonecrosis) of the femoral head (Stage II/III) due to subchondral fracture.
*   **[[Sagging Rope Sign]]**: A radio-opaque line superimposed on the metaphysis appearing like a hanging rope.
    *   *Indication:* Seen in [[Perthes' Disease]] (severe head deformation/coxa magna).
*   **[[Pistol Grip Deformity]]**: Loss of the normal concavity of the femoral head-neck junction (cam lesion).
    *   *Indication:* [[Femoroacetabular Impingement]] (FAI) or old SCFE.
*   **[[Spur Sign]]**: A triangular bony density at the inferomedial aspect of the ilium.
    *   *Indication:* Pathognomonic for **Both Column Fractures** of the acetabulum.
*   **[[Thurston Holland Sign]]**: A triangular metaphyseal fragment seen in Physeal injuries.
    *   *Indication:* Salter-Harris Type II fracture.
