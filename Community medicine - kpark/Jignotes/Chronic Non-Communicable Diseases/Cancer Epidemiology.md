# [[Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases]] > Cancer Epidemiology

### **Cancer Epidemiology**

**Definition**
Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by an [[abnormal growth of cells]], potential to invade adjacent tissues, and ability to spread to distant organs ([[metastasis]]). It is a major non-communicable disease (NCD) and a leading cause of death globally.

### **1. Problem Statement (Burden of Disease)**

*   **Global Scenario:**
    *   **Incidence:** Breast cancer is the most frequent, followed by Lung and Colorectal.
    *   **Mortality:** [[Lung cancer]] is the leading cause of cancer death, followed by Liver and Stomach cancer.
*   **Indian Scenario (Source: Globocan 2020/NCRP):**
    *   **Males:** [[Lip and Oral cavity]] cancer is most common, followed by Lung and Stomach cancer.
    *   **Females:** [[Breast cancer]] is the top-most cancer, followed by [[Cervical cancer]] and Ovarian cancer.
    *   **Mortality:** High case fatality rates due to late presentation (advanced stages).

### **2. Epidemiological Determinants (Risk Factors)**

Cancer etiology is multifactorial. The interaction between **Agent**, **Host**, and **Environment** determines the outcome.

#### **A. Agent Factors (Carcinogens)**
These are external agents that initiate the neoplastic process.

| **Type** | **Agents** | **Associated Cancers** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Physical** | Ionizing Radiation (X-rays) | Leukemia, Skin, Thyroid |
| | UV Radiation (Sunlight) | Skin cancer (Melanoma) |
| | Chronic Heat (Kangri use) | Kangri cancer (Skin) |
| **Chemical** | [[Tobacco]] (Smoking/Chewing) | **Lung**, Oral, Larynx, Pancreas, Bladder |
| | Alcohol | Liver, Esophagus |
| | Aniline Dyes | **Bladder cancer** |
| | Asbestos | Mesothelioma (Lung/Pleura) |
| | Vinyl Chloride | Liver Angiosarcoma |
| **Biological** | Hepatitis B & C Virus | Hepatocellular Carcinoma (Liver) |
| | [[Human Papilloma Virus]] (HPV) | **Cervical cancer**, Penile cancer |
| | Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) | Burkitt’s Lymphoma, Nasopharyngeal CA |
| | *H. pylori* (Bacteria) | Stomach cancer |
| **Nutritional** | High Fat / Low Fiber Diet | Breast, Colorectal cancer |
| | Smoked fish/Aflatoxins | Stomach, Liver cancer |

#### **B. Host Factors**
*   **Age:** Incidence generally rises with age (cumulative exposure). Exceptions: Acute Leukemia (children). Breast cancer shows a [[bimodal distribution]] (peaks pre- and post-menopause).
*   **Sex:** Males (Lung, Oral); Females (Breast, Cervix, Thyroid).
*   **Genetics:** Familial adenomatous polyposis (Colon), Retinoblastoma, BRCA genes (Breast/Ovary).

#### **C. Environmental Factors**
*   **Air Pollution:** Particulate matter, benzopyrenes (Lung cancer).
*   **Water:** Arsenic contamination (Skin, Bladder).
*   **Socio-economic:** Cervical cancer is higher in low socio-economic groups (poor hygiene); Breast cancer is higher in upper socio-economic groups.

### **3. Warning Signs of Cancer**

Early detection is crucial. The 7 danger signals can be remembered using the mnemonic **CAUTION**:

*   **C** - **C**hange in bowel or bladder habits.
*   **A** - **A** sore that does not heal.
*   **U** - **U**nusual bleeding or discharge.
*   **T** - **T**hickening or lump in breast or elsewhere.
*   **I** - **I**ndigestion or difficulty in swallowing.
*   **O** - **O**bvious change in a wart or mole.
*   **N** - **N**agging cough or hoarseness.

### **4. Prevention and Control Strategies**

Cancer control aims to reduce incidence, morbidity, and mortality.

#### **I. Primary Prevention (Health Promotion & Specific Protection)**
*Target:* Healthy population (Pre-pathogenesis phase).
*   **Control of Tobacco & Alcohol:** Most effective strategy.
*   **Dietary Modification:** Increase fruits/vegetables/fiber; reduce saturated fats and smoked foods.
*   **Occupational Safety:** Protection from asbestos, aniline dyes, radiation.
*   **Immunization:**
    *   [[Hepatitis B Vaccine]] (prevents Liver cancer).
    *   [[HPV Vaccine]] (prevents Cervical cancer).
*   **Personal Hygiene:** Genital hygiene (Cervix/Penis cancer prevention).

#### **II. Secondary Prevention (Early Diagnosis & Treatment)**
*Target:* Early pathogenesis phase (Screening).
*   **Concept:** Detection of [[Carcinoma in situ]] or pre-cancerous lesions.
*   **Screening Criteria:** Disease must be an important health problem, have a recognizable latent stage, and an effective test and treatment must exist.

**Major Screening Modalities:**
1.  **Cervical Cancer:**
    *   **Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid (VIA):** Cost-effective, immediate results (turn white).
    *   **Pap Smear:** Cytology (Gold standard in many settings).
    *   **HPV DNA Testing:** High sensitivity.
2.  **Breast Cancer:**
    *   **Breast Self-Examination (BSE):** Awareness tool.
    *   **Mammography:** Gold standard for women >40 years.
3.  **Oral Cancer:**
    *   Visual inspection of the oral cavity (for leukoplakia, erythroplakia, submucous fibrosis).

#### **III. Tertiary Prevention**
*Target:* Late pathogenesis phase.
*   **Disability Limitation:** Radical surgery, Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy.
*   **Rehabilitation:** Physical (prosthetics), vocational, and psychosocial support.
*   **Palliative Care:** Relief of cancer pain (Morphine availability) and improving quality of life in terminal stages.

### **5. National Programme: NP-NCD**
*(formerly NCCP - National Cancer Control Programme)*

Now integrated into the **National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases ([[NP-NCD]])**.
*   **Focus:** Common NCDs (Cancer, Diabetes, CVD, Stroke).
*   **Strategy:**
    *   **Opportunistic Screening:** At NCD clinics (District/CHC level) for people >30 years.
    *   **NCD Cells:** Established at State and District levels.
    *   **Day Care Chemotherapy:** At District Hospitals.
    *   **Regional Cancer Centres (RCC):** For tertiary care and research.
