### Aspects of School Health Service

#### 1. Health Appraisal
This involves periodic medical examinations and daily observations.
*   **Periodic Medical Examination:**
    *   **Timing:** The School Health Committee (1961) recommended exams at:
        1.  School Entry (5–6 years)
        2.  Class 4/5 (10–11 years)
        3.  Class 8/Middle School (13–14 years)
        *   *Note:* [[NRHM]]/RBSK guidelines recommend screening **once every 6 months**.
*   **Daily Morning Inspection:**
    *   Carried out by the **Class Teacher**.
    *   **Clues to look for:** Flushed face, rash, red eyes, coughing, sneezing, skin infections (scabies), lice, listlessness.
*   **Examination of School Personnel:** Teachers and staff must be screened (especially for Pulmonary TB) as they are part of the child's environment.

#### 2. Remedial Measures and Follow-up
*   Screening is useless without treatment.
*   Special clinics for school children should be arranged at the [[Primary Health Centre]] (PHC).
*   Referral services to specialists for dental, eye, and ENT defects.

#### 3. Prevention of Communicable Diseases
*   Review of immunization status at school entry.
*   Administration of specific vaccines (e.g., TT at 10 and 16 years).
*   Record maintenance of immunizations.

#### 4. Healthful School Environment (Sanitary Standards)
A healthy environment prevents disease and serves as a practical health education tool.

| Parameter | Minimum Standard |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Location** | Away from noise, traffic, and factories. |
| **Site** | 10 acres for Higher Secondary; 5 acres for Primary. |
| **Structure** | Heat-resistant walls, single-storied preferably. |
| **Classroom** | Max **40 students** per class. >10 sq. ft per student. |
| **Furniture** | **[[Minus type desk]]** (Zero or Plus type are bad for posture). |
| **Lighting** | Natural light from the **left side**. |
| **Ventilation** | Doors + Windows area should be **>25% of floor area**. |
| **Water** | Safe, potable, continuous supply. |
| **Lavatory** | **1 Urinal per 60 students**; **1 Latrine per 100 students**. |

> **Mnemonic for Desk Types:**
> *   **Minus:** **M**ost ideal (Edge of desk overlaps the seat).
> *   **Plus:** **P**oor posture (Gap between desk and seat).
> *   **Zero:** **Z**ero gap (Edge of desk touches edge of seat).

#### 5. Nutritional Services
*   **[[Mid-Day Meal Scheme]] (MDMS):**
    *   **Objective:** Enhance enrollment/retention and improve nutrition.
    *   **Requirement:** Meal must provide **1/3rd of daily calorie** and **1/2 of daily protein** requirement.
    *   **Menu:** Locally available foods, low cost, frequently changed.
*   **Micronutrients:** Weekly Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation ([[WIFS]]), Vitamin A prophylaxis, and bi-annual deworming ([[Albendazole]] 400mg).

#### 6. First Aid and Emergency Care
*   Teachers must be trained in First Aid.
*   Schools must have a fully equipped First Aid Box.
*   Common emergencies: Accidents, epistaxis, fainting, epileptic fits.

#### 7. Mental Health
*   School is strategic for shaping behavior.
*   Teachers help prevent maladjustment and [[Juvenile Delinquency]].
*   Vocational counseling to guide careers.

#### 8. Dental Health
*   Annual dental examination.
*   Dental hygienists can assist in prophylactic cleansing.

#### 9. Eye Health Services
*   **[[School Eye Screening]] Programme:**

    *   Screener: Teachers trained for 1 day.
    *   Ratio: 1 Teacher per 150 students.
    *   **Referral Cut-off:** Visual acuity **< 6/9** in either eye.
    *   Treatment: Free spectacles/Vitamin A.

#### 10. Health Education

*   Topics: Personal hygiene (skin, nails, teeth), environmental sanitation, family life education.
*   Method: Active participation (not just lectures).
