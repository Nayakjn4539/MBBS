# Pertussis (Whooping Cough)

[[Pertussis]], commonly known as **Whooping Cough** or the **"Hundred Day Cough"**, is an acute infectious disease of the respiratory tract caused by the bacterium *Bordetella pertussis*. It is a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality, particularly in unimmunized infants.

### **Epidemiological Determinants**

**1. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** [[Bordetella pertussis]] (Gram-negative, non-motile cocco-bacillus).
*   **Related Agent:** *B. parapertussis* causes about 5% of cases (usually milder).
*   **Toxins:** Produces powerful exotoxins and endotoxins affecting the respiratory epithelium.
*   **Survival:** It is a delicate organism; does not survive long outside the human body.

**2. Host Factors**
*   **Natural Host:** [[Human reservoir]] only. There is **no animal reservoir**.
*   **Age:** Primarily affects infants and pre-school children (highest mortality in <6 months). However, incidence is shifting to older children/adolescents due to waning immunity.
*   **Immunity:**
    *   **No long-term passive immunity:** Infants are susceptible from birth (maternal antibodies do not provide sufficient protection).
    *   **Acquired Immunity:** One attack confers prolonged immunity, though second attacks can occur (usually mild).
*   **Carriers:** There is **no chronic carrier state**. Sources are clinical cases (typical or atypical).

**3. Environmental Factors**
*   **Season:** Occurs throughout the year but tends to peak in **winter and spring**.
*   **Predisposing factors:** Overcrowding and poor ventilation facilitate spread.

### **Transmission**

*   **Mode:** Mainly by [[Droplet infection]] and direct contact.
*   **Infective Material:** Nasopharyngeal and bronchial secretions.
*   **Risk of Transmission:**
    *   **Secondary Attack Rate (SAR):** Extremely high (**>90%**) in unimmunized household contacts.
    *   **Period of Communicability:** Most infectious during the **Catarrhal stage** (first week). Infectivity extends from 7 days after exposure to about 3 weeks after the onset of the paroxysmal stage.

### **Incubation Period**
*   Usually **7 to 14 days** (Range: 3–21 days).

---

### **Clinical Picture**

The disease typically progresses through **three stages**, lasting about 6 to 8 weeks total.

**1. Catarrhal Stage (lasts ~10 days)**
*   **Most Infectious Stage.**
*   Insidious onset.
*   Symptoms: Mild fever, irritating cough, coryza (runny nose), sneezing, lacrimation.
*   Often mistaken for a common cold, leading to missed diagnosis and spread.

**2. Paroxysmal Stage (lasts 2–4 weeks)**
*   Cough becomes severe and comes in **bursts (paroxysms)**.
*   **The "Whoop":** A deep, high-pitched inspiratory sound produced when the child inhales rapidly against a partially closed glottis after a coughing fit. (Note: Infants <6 months may not whoop; they may present with [[Apnea]]).
*   **Post-tussive vomiting:** Vomiting immediately after a coughing fit is a hallmark sign.
*   **Physical signs:** Facial congestion, cyanosis, bulging eyes, and tongue protrusion during attacks.

**3. Convalescent Stage (lasts 1–2 weeks)**
*   Gradual reduction in frequency and severity of cough.
*   Secondary bacterial infections can occur here.

### **Complications**

*   **Respiratory:** [[Bronchopneumonia]] (most common cause of death), bronchitis, bronchiectasis.
*   **Mechanical (due to pressure of coughing):** Subconjunctival hemorrhage, epistaxis, umbilical hernia, rectal prolapse, frenulum ulcer (from tongue biting).
*   **Neurological:** Convulsions, coma, encephalopathy (due to hypoxia/toxins).

---

### **Diagnosis**

*   **Clinical:** Persistent cough >2 weeks with whoop, post-tussive vomiting, or apneic spells in infants.
*   **Lab Diagnosis:**
    *   **Culture (Gold Standard):** [[Nasopharyngeal swab]] (pernasal swab) cultured on **Bordet-Gengou medium** (look for "mercury drop" colonies) or Regan-Lowe medium. *Note: Throat swabs are useless.*
    *   **PCR:** Highly sensitive, useful in the first 4 weeks.
    *   **Blood Picture:** Marked **Leukocytosis** with absolute [[Lymphocytosis]] (resembling leukemia).

### **Treatment**

**1. Antibiotics**
*   **Drug of Choice:** [[Erythromycin]] (40-50 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses for 10 days).
*   **Alternatives:** Azithromycin or Clarithromycin.
*   **Timing:** Antibiotics are most effective if started in the **Catarrhal stage** (may abort the disease). In the paroxysmal stage, they do not shorten the illness but render the patient non-infectious.

**2. Supportive Care**
*   Maintain nutrition and hydration (re-feed after vomiting).
*   Oxygen and suction for cyanosis/apnea.
*   Avoid cough triggers (smoke, dust).

### **Prevention and Control**

**1. Vaccination (Active Immunization)**
*   **Vaccine:** [[DPT vaccine]] (Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus) or Pentavalent vaccine (in India).
*   **Type:** Whole-cell pertussis (wP) or Acellular pertussis (aP). *wP is more reactogenic but immunogenic; aP causes fewer side effects.*
*   **Schedule (NIS India):**
    *   **Primary:** 3 doses at **6, 10, and 14 weeks** (Pentavalent).
    *   **Booster 1:** At **16–24 months** (DPT).
    *   **Booster 2:** At **5–6 years** (DPT).
*   **Contraindications:**
    *   History of anaphylaxis to previous dose.
    *   Developing [[Encephalopathy]] within 7 days of a previous dose.
    *   *Note: Stable neurological conditions (e.g., controlled epilepsy, cerebral palsy) are NOT contraindications.*

**2. Management of Contacts**
*   **Chemoprophylaxis:** Erythromycin for 10 days for all household contacts (regardless of immunization status).
*   **Immunization:** Update vaccination status of under-immunized children.

**3. Isolation**
*   Isolate the case for **4 weeks** or until at least **5 days** of antibiotic therapy have been completed.

### **Clinical Relevance**
If a child presents with a cough lasting more than 2 weeks without fever but with post-tussive vomiting, **always suspect Pertussis**. In adults/adolescents, it often presents as a nagging chronic cough ("100-day cough") due to waning immunity, acting as a reservoir for infecting infants.
