# [[Pregnancy And Infant Deaths]] > Legitimacy vs Paternity

### Definitions

*   **[[Legitimacy]]:** It is the **legal status** of a child born to a couple who are legally married to each other. It determines the child's rights to inheritance and social status.
*   **[[Paternity]]:** It refers to the **biological relationship** between a father and a child. It is a biological fact, regardless of the marital status of the parents.
*   **[[Affiliation Case]]:** A legal process to fix the paternity of an illegitimate child to compel the biological father to provide maintenance.

### Legal Presumption of Legitimacy ([[Section 112 IEA]])

According to **Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act**, the legitimacy of a child is conclusively presumed if:
1.  The child is born **during the continuance of a valid marriage** between the mother and any man.
2.  The child is born **within 280 days** after the dissolution of the marriage (by death or divorce), provided the mother remains unmarried.

**Exception (Plea of Non-Access):**
The only valid legal defense to disprove legitimacy under this section is proving **"Non-Access"**. The husband must prove that he had *no access* to the wife at any time when the child could have been begotten. DNA evidence is now increasingly accepted by courts to rebut this presumption, though the law technically prioritizes the social contract of marriage.

### Differences between Legitimacy and Paternity

| Feature | [[Legitimacy]] | [[Paternity]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nature** | **Legal** concept (Status) | **Biological** concept (Genetics) |
| **Basis** | Based on the **marriage contract** | Based on **genetic inheritance** |
| **Proof** | Proved by marriage certificate and timing of birth ([[Section 112 IEA]]) | Proved by [[DNA Profiling]] |
| **Status of Child** | Legitimate | Can be legitimate or illegitimate |
| **Focus** | Focuses on rights (Inheritance, Name) | Focuses on biological origin |
| **Disproof** | Difficult; requires proof of non-access | Easier via scientific methods (DNA) |

### Causes of Disputed Paternity/Legitimacy

Disputes usually arise in civil or criminal courts due to the following reasons (**Mnemonic: DIMES**):

1.  **D**ivorce proceedings: Husband denies paternity to prove [[Adultery]] by the wife to get a divorce.
2.  **I**nheritance: To claim a share in the property of the deceased or ancestral property.
3.  **M**aintenance: A woman claims maintenance for her illegitimate child from the alleged father (Under **Section 125 CrPC**).
4.  **E**xchange of babies: Accidental or intentional swapping of newborns in hospitals.
5.  **S**upposititious Child: A woman feigns pregnancy and delivery, then produces a child (usually adopted or stolen) claiming it is her own (often to extort money or prevent the husband from remarrying).

### Medicolegal Aspects and Related Conditions

#### 1. [[Supposititious Child]]
*   **Definition:** A child produced by a woman who claims it to be her own when it is not.
*   **Motive:** To inherit property, blackmail, or retain affection of the husband.
*   **Medical Role:**
    *   Examine the woman for **[[Signs of Recent Delivery]]**.
    *   Check for signs of [[Pseudocyesis]] (Phantom pregnancy).
    *   Examine the child to check if its age corresponds to the alleged delivery date.
    *   **[[DNA Profiling]]** is conclusive.

#### 2. [[Posthumous Child]]
*   **Definition:** A child born *after* the death of the father.
*   **Legitimacy:** Legitimate if born within **280 days** of the father's death (provided the mother did not remarry).
*   **Issues:** Claims of inheritance; mother’s character assassination.

#### 3. [[Superfecundation]]
*   **Definition:** Fertilization of two separate ova released in the same menstrual cycle by sperms from **two different males** in separate acts of coitus within a short interval.
*   **Result:** Twins with different fathers (one legitimate, one illegitimate, or both illegitimate).
*   **Diagnosis:** Evident if fathers are of different races (one white, one black baby); confirmed by DNA.

#### 4. [[Superfetation]]
*   **Definition:** Fertilization of a second ovum released during an **already established pregnancy**.
*   **Result:** Delivery of two babies of different gestational ages (e.g., one full term, one premature).
*   **Validity:** Theoretically impossible in humans (as ovulation ceases during pregnancy) but claimed in rare cases.

### Establishing Paternity/Maternity

The medical officer may be asked to establish parentage in cases of disputed paternity, interchangeable infants, or identification of dead bodies (infanticide).

#### 1. Physical Examination (Least Reliable)
*   **Likeness:** Comparing facial features, ear shape, eye color (Note: *Atavism* - child resembling grandparents).
*   **Gestation Period:** Checking if the child is full-term or premature relative to the date of marriage/cohabitation.

#### 2. Blood Grouping (Exclusionary Evidence)
*   **Principle:** A child cannot have a blood group antigen that is not present in either parent.
*   **ABO/Rh System:** Can only **exclude** a falsely accused man but **cannot prove** paternity (as many men share the same blood group).
*   **Example:** If Mother is 'O' and Child is 'AB', the Father *cannot* be 'O'.

#### 3. [[DNA Fingerprinting]] (Gold Standard)
*   **Principle:** Every individual's DNA is unique (except monozygotic twins) and is inherited 50% from the mother and 50% from the father.
*   **Technique:** [[PCR]] (Polymerase Chain Reaction) based analysis of **STRs** (Short Tandem Repeats).
*   **Accuracy:** Offers **99.9% probability** of paternity inclusion and 100% certainty of exclusion.
*   **Samples:** Blood, buccal swab, hair root, umbilical cord.

### Mnemonic

**Causes of Disputed Paternity:** **"DIMES"**
*   **D**ivorce (Adultery)
*   **I**nheritance
*   **M**aintenance (Affiliation cases)
*   **E**xchange of babies
*   **S**upposititious Child

**Section 112 IEA:** Think **"1 + 1 + 2 = 4 (Family of Four)"** -> Father + Mother + Valid Marriage = **Legitimate** Child. Also remember **280 days**.
