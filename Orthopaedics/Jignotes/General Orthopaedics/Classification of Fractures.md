# Classification of Fractures

A [[fracture]] is defined as a break in the structural continuity of [[bone]]. It may range from a simple crack to a complex shattering of the cortex. Proper classification is essential for communication between medical professionals, planning treatment, and predicting prognosis.

Fractures are classified based on several parameters:

### 1. Etiological Classification
This classification is based on the cause or the force required to produce the fracture.

*   **Traumatic Fracture:** A fracture sustained due to significant force (e.g., road traffic accident, fall from height) acting on a normal bone.
*   **[[Pathological Fracture]]:** A fracture occurring in a bone weakened by underlying disease. It occurs with trivial trauma or even spontaneously.
    *   **Generalized Causes:** [[Osteoporosis]] (commonest), [[Osteogenesis Imperfecta]], [[Paget's disease]].
    *   **Local Causes:** [[Bone cyst]], [[Metastasis]], [[Osteomyelitis]].
*   **[[Stress Fracture]] (Fatigue Fracture):** A hairline crack resulting from chronic, repetitive stress on a normal bone. Common in athletes and military recruits (e.g., [[March fracture]] of the 2nd metatarsal).

### 2. Relationship with External Environment
This is the most critical distinction for immediate management and prognosis regarding infection.

*   **Closed ([[Simple Fracture]]):** The overlying [[skin]] and [[soft tissue]] integument are intact. There is no communication between the fracture site and the external environment.
*   **Open ([[Compound Fracture]]):** The skin or body cavity is breached, exposing the fracture site to the external environment. These are liable to contamination and [[infection]].

#### [[Gustilo-Anderson Classification]] for Open Fractures
This is the standard system used to grade open fractures based on wound size, soft tissue damage, and contamination.

| Type | Wound Size | Soft Tissue Injury | Bone Injury/Contamination |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type I** | < 1 cm | Minimal, clean puncture | Simple fracture pattern, minimal contamination |
| **Type II** | 1–10 cm | Moderate, no skin flap | Moderate comminution/contamination |
| **Type III A** | > 10 cm | Extensive, but adequate soft tissue coverage possible | High energy, comminuted |
| **Type III B** | > 10 cm | Extensive periosteal stripping, requires flap coverage | Severe contamination |
| **Type III C** | Any size | Associated arterial injury requiring repair | Critical condition |

**Clinical Implication:** The risk of [[osteomyelitis]] and [[nonunion]] increases significantly from Type I to Type III C. Type III C injuries have a high risk of [[amputation]].

### 3. Completeness of Fracture
*   **Complete Fracture:** The bone is completely broken into two or more fragments.
*   **Incomplete Fracture:** The cortex is not completely broken. These are common in the pediatric population due to the elasticity of children's bones.
    *   **[[Greenstick Fracture]]:** The bone bends and breaks only on the convex side (tension side), while the concave side remains intact.
    *   **[[Torus Fracture]] (Buckle):** A buckling of the cortex due to compression failure.

### 4. Fracture Pattern (Morphology)
The pattern often indicates the mechanism of injury (force applied).

*   **Transverse:** The fracture line is perpendicular to the long axis of the bone. Caused by a direct tapping force. Usually stable after reduction.
*   **Oblique:** The fracture line runs at an angle to the axis. Caused by bending force. Unstable.
*   **Spiral:** The fracture line runs in a spiral fashion. Caused by twisting/torsional force. Highly unstable.
*   **Comminuted:** The bone is broken into more than two fragments (multiple pieces). Caused by high-energy crushing force.
*   **Segmental:** A double fracture in a single bone, isolating a segment of the diaphysis. Risk of [[avascular necrosis]] in the intermediate segment.
*   **Impacted:** The fracture fragments are jammed tightly together. Usually stable.
*   **Avulsion:** A chunk of bone is pulled off by a ligament or tendon (e.g., [[patella fracture]]).

### 5. Displacement
Displacement is described based on the position of the **distal fragment** relative to the proximal fragment.

*   **Undisplaced:** Anatomical alignment is maintained.
*   **Displaced:**
    1.  **Shift (Translation):** Sideways, anterior, or posterior shift.
    2.  **Angulation (Tilt):** Described by the direction of the apex of the deformity or the direction of the distal fragment (e.g., varus/valgus).
    3.  **Rotation (Twist):** Internal or external rotation of the distal fragment.
    4.  **Length Discrepancy:** Shortening (overlap) or distraction (separation).

### 6. Anatomical Location
Fractures are described based on the specific part of the bone involved:
*   **Epiphyseal:** Involving the end of the bone (often articular).
*   **Metaphyseal:** Involving the cancellous bone between the epiphysis and diaphysis.
*   **Diaphyseal:** Involving the shaft.
*   **Intra-articular:** The fracture line extends into the joint surface. These require perfect anatomical reduction to prevent [[osteoarthritis]].

#### Physeal Injuries (Pediatric)
Fractures involving the growth plate are classified using the **[[Salter-Harris Classification]]**.

| Type | Description | Prognosis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type I** | **S**eparation through the physis (hypertrophic zone). | Good |
| **Type II** | **A**bove the physis (exits through metaphysis). Most common. | Good |
| **Type III** | **L**ower than physis (exits through epiphysis). Intra-articular. | Fair |
| **Type IV** | **T**hrough and through (metaphysis, physis, epiphysis). | Poor (risk of growth arrest) |
| **Type V** | **R**am (Crush) injury to the physis. | Worst (high risk of growth arrest) |

**Mnemonic for Salter-Harris:** **SALTR**
*   **S** - **S**lipped (Type I)
*   **A** - **A**bove (Type II)
*   **L** - **L**ower (Type III)
*   **T** - **T**hrough (Type IV)
*   **R** - **R**uined / c**R**ush (Type V)

### 7. AO Classification (Alphanumeric)
Used for precise documentation and research.
*   **Bone:** Humerus (1), Radius/Ulna (2), Femur (3), Tibia/Fibula (4).
*   **Segment:** Proximal (1), Diaphyseal (2), Distal (3).
*   **Type:**
    *   **A:** Simple.
    *   **B:** Wedge.
    *   **C:** Complex.
