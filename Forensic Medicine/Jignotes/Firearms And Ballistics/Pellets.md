# [[Firearms And Ballistics]] > Pellets

### **Pellets (Shotgun Projectiles)**

**Pellets** (also known as [[lead shots]]) are the multiple small spherical projectiles contained within a [[shotgun cartridge]]. Unlike rifled firearms that fire a single bullet, shotguns are designed to discharge a mass of these pellets to create a wide pattern of impact.

### **1. Composition and Characteristics**

*   **Material:** Traditionally made of **lead**.
    *   **Soft Shot:** Pure lead.
    *   **Chilled/Hard Shot:** Lead hardened with a small amount of **antimony** to prevent deformation during firing.
    *   **Plated Shot:** Coated with copper or nickel for better aerodynamics.
    *   **Non-Toxic/Green Shot:** Made of steel, bismuth, tungsten, or nylon (used to prevent environmental lead contamination, especially in wetlands).
*   **Shape:** Spherical (round).
*   **Location:** Housed in the top compartment of the cartridge case, separated from the gunpowder by the [[Wad]].

### **2. Classification of Pellets**

Pellets are classified based on their size and number.

| Type | Characteristics | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Buck Shot** | Large size, fewer in number (approx. 20) | Hunting large game, Police/Military |
| **Bird Shot** | Small size, numerous (approx. 200) | Hunting birds, small game |
| **Dust Shot** | Very fine, extremely numerous (approx. 2000) | Pest control, snake charmers |
| **Single Slug** | One large projectile (Rifled slug/Brenneke) | Hunting large game (acts like a bullet) |

> **Note:** The size of pellets is difficult to measure accurately after firing because they often get deformed upon impact or passage through the barrel (especially if choked).

### **3. Ballistics and Dispersion**

The behavior of pellets after leaving the muzzle is the key to determining the **range of fire**.

*   **Initial Exit:** Pellets emerge from the barrel as a **solid single mass** along with the wad.
*   **Dispersion:** As they travel, air resistance causes them to spread out (fan out) like a cone.
*   **Rate of Dispersion:** Generally, the spread of the shot pattern increases with distance.
    *   **Rule of Thumb:** The diameter of the spread in inches is roughly equal to the distance in yards (in non-choked guns).
*   **Effect of [[Choking]]:** A constriction at the muzzle end of the barrel (Choke) reduces the dispersion, keeping pellets grouped tighter for a longer distance.

#### **Atypical Dispersion Phenomena**
1.  **[[Balling of Shot]]:** Occasionally, pellets fuse together due to heat or pressure, or fail to separate due to defective wads. They travel as a single mass for a long distance, creating a single large entry wound even at long range (mimicking a close-range shot).
2.  **[[Billiard Ball Ricochet Effect]]:** In *distant* shots, pellets may strike each other or an intermediate object, causing them to scatter erratically or clump, creating irregular wound patterns.

### **4. Wound Ballistics (Entry Wounds)**

The appearance of the entry wound depends entirely on the range of fire and the degree of pellet dispersion.

| Range | Distance (Approx)* | Wound Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Contact** | Touching skin | **Stellate/Cruciate** (ragged) shape due to gas expansion. Muzzle impression may be present. |
| **Close** | < 1 meter | **Single circular hole** with **scalloped** or ragged margins (caused by individual pellets starting to break away from the main mass). Known as **"Rat Hole"** entry. |
| **Intermediate** | 1 to 3 meters | **Central hole** (main mass) surrounded by **Satellite holes** (individual pellets that have separated). *Wadding may enter the wound.* |
| **Distant** | > 4 meters | **No central hole**. Multiple small, separate, independent circular holes spread over an area. |

**Mnemonic for Shotgun Range:** **"C-R-S-D"**
*   **C**ontact = **C**ruciate/Charring
*   **R**ange (Close) = **R**at hole
*   **S**hort (Intermediate) = **S**atellite holes
*   **D**istant = **D**ispersed independent holes

### **5. Autopsy Findings and Recovery**

*   **X-Ray:** **Mandatory** before dissection.
    *   Locates the exact position of pellets.
    *   Helps differentiate between buckshot (which looks like bullets) and smaller shot.
    *   Identifies the "Lead Snowstorm" effect (fragments of lead peeling off).
*   **Recovery:**
    *   It is **not necessary** to recover *every* single pellet in a birdshot injury.
    *   Recover a **representative sample** (10-12 pellets) to determine shot size.
    *   **Crucial:** Always recover the **[[Wad]]** (plastic/felt/cardboard) found in the wound. It identifies the gauge and make of the ammunition.
*   **Handling:**
    *   Use **rubber-tipped forceps** or fingers.
    *   Do **not** use metal instruments that scratch the soft lead pellets (scratches alter ballistic comparison).
    *   Do not wash the pellets (preserves trace evidence).
*   **Exit Wounds:** Rare in shotgun injuries unless:
    *   Fired from very close range (contact).
    *   The body part is thin (e.g., neck).
    *   A rifle slug was used.

### **6. Medicolegal Importance**

1.  **Range of Fire:** Determined primarily by the **dispersion pattern** of the pellets (Rat hole vs. Satellite vs. Independent).
2.  **Weapon Identification:** The size and weight of pellets help identify the cartridge type, which links to the type of [[Shotgun]] used.
3.  **Nature of Injury:**
    *   **Suicide:** Usually contact wounds (mouth, temple, chest). Hand may show soot/powder.
    *   **Homicide:** Range varies; usually no weapon at the scene.
    *   **Accident:** Common in hunters (ricochet pellets).
4.  **Severity:** Contact/Close range shotgun wounds are massively destructive and usually fatal. Distant wounds may be superficial (skin deep) and survivable.
