# [[Mechanical Injuries]] > suicidal vs homicidal injuries

### **General Principles: Suicidal vs Homicidal Injuries**

Differentiation between suicidal and homicidal mechanical injuries depends heavily on the nature of the wound, anatomical location, circumstantial evidence, and scene investigation.

#### **1. Incised Wounds (Cut Throat Injuries)**

This is the most common form of sharp force injury requiring differentiation.

| **Feature** | **Suicidal Cut Throat** | **Homicidal Cut Throat** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Site/Level** | High up in the neck, usually **above the thyroid cartilage** (accessible area). | Lower down in the neck, usually **below the thyroid cartilage** or cricoid. |
| **Direction** | **Oblique**. Usually from **Left to Right** (in right-handed persons) and above downwards. | **Transverse** or horizontal. Can be from any direction (often from behind). |
| **Hesitation Cuts** | **Present**. Multiple, small, superficial, parallel cuts at the commencement of the main wound. Aka [[Tentative cuts]] or trial cuts. | **Absent**. The intention is to kill immediately with force. |
| **Severity** | Usually less severe. Carotids often escape as the head is thrown back (sternomastoid protects them). | Very severe. Often deep, cutting through all tissues, neck vessels, and even vertebral column. |
| **Edges** | Usually clean-cut. | Can be ragged if there was a struggle. |
| **Tail of Wound** | **Present**. The wound becomes shallower at the end. | **Absent** or less distinct. Wound depth is often uniform. |
| **Defense Wounds** | **Absent**. | **Present**. Seen on palms, ulnar aspect of forearms/hands. |
| **Clothing** | Usually removed or pushed aside to expose the skin. | Usually present, often cut through corresponding to the wound. |
| **Scene** | Usually a closed room (bathroom/bedroom). Mirror may be present. | Disordered scene, signs of struggle, blood splatter. |
| **Weapon** | Often found firmly grasped in hand ([[Cadaveric spasm]]) or nearby. | Usually absent (taken by the assailant). |

**Mnemonic for Suicidal Cut Throat:** **"SHARP"**
*   **S** - Superficial cuts (Hesitation marks)
*   **H** - High up (Above thyroid)
*   **A** - Accessible site
*   **R** - Removed clothing
*   **P** - Parallel small cuts

#### **2. Stab Wounds**

[[Stab wounds]] are penetrating injuries caused by pointed weapons.

| **Feature** | **Suicidal Stab** | **Homicidal Stab** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Number** | Usually **Single** or multiple clustered in one area. | **Multiple**, scattered over the body. |
| **Site** | **"Site of Election"**: Precordium (Heart), Epigastrium, Wrist, Femoral vessels. Accessible areas. | Anywhere. Often chest, back, neck, or abdomen. Inaccessible areas suggest homicide. |
| **Hesitation Marks** | **Present**. Tentative pricks or small cuts around the main wound. | **Absent**. |
| **Depth/Force** | Variable. Often thrust in a way to avoid ribs. | Forceful. Ribs or bones may be cut/fractured. |
| **Clothing** | Usually removed from the target area. | Clothes are penetrated/torn. |
| **Weapon** | Often present in the wound or hand. | Usually missing. |
| **Defense Wounds** | Absent. | Present on hands/forearms. |
| **Special Types** | **[[Hara-kiri]]** (Seppuku): Ritualistic suicide involving disembowelment. | **Overkill**: Massive number of wounds (psychotic/emotional rage). |

#### **3. Firearm Injuries**

Differentiation relies heavily on the range of fire and entry wound location.

| **Feature** | **Suicidal Firearm Injury** | **Homicidal Firearm Injury** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Range** | **Contact** or **Close range** (< arm's length). Muzzle impression often seen. | Can be **Distant**, Intermediate, or Close. |
| **Site of Election** | **Temple** (Right temple for right-handed), Forehead (center), Mouth (palate), Heart (Precordium), Under chin. | Any part of the body. Back of head or back of trunk strongly suggests homicide. |
| **Number of Shots** | Usually **Single** fatal shot. Multiple shots are rare (unless automatic weapon or first shot missed vital structure). | Often **Multiple** shots. |
| **Trajectory** | Compatible with the length of the victim's arm. | Any trajectory. |
| **Gunshot Residue (GSR)** | Present on the **firing hand** of the victim. | Absent on the victim's hands (unless defensive posture close to barrel). |
| **Cadaveric Spasm** | Weapon may be firmly gripped in hand. **Diagnostic of Suicide**. | Weapon absent. |

> Draw a diagram showing "Sites of Election" for suicidal injuries: Temple for gun, Neck for cut throat, Left wrist for incised wound, Precordium for stab.

#### **4. Specific Identifying Features**

**A. [[Hesitation Cuts]] (Tentative Cuts):**
*   **Definition:** Multiple, small, superficial incisions usually found at the beginning of the main suicidal wound.
*   **Significance:** Diagnostic of **Suicide**.
*   **Mechanism:** The victim "tests" the sharpness of the weapon or builds up courage before the final fatal act.
*   **Common Sites:** Throat, Wrists (flexor aspect).

**B. [[Defense Wounds]]:**
*   **Definition:** Injuries sustained by the victim while trying to protect themselves from the weapon.
*   **Significance:** Diagnostic of **Homicide**.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Active:** Grasping the weapon (cuts on palms/flexor aspect of fingers).
    *   **Passive:** Raising arms to shield face/head (cuts/bruises on ulnar aspect of forearm, back of hands).

**C. [[Cadaveric Spasm]]:**
*   **Definition:** Instantaneous rigor mortis occurring at the moment of death.
*   **Significance:** If the weapon is found firmly grasped in the deceased's hand, it is absolute proof of **Suicide**. It cannot be simulated after death.

#### **Medicolegal Aspects & Autopsy Findings**

1.  **Scene Investigation:**
    *   **Suicide:** Door locked from inside, suicide note (check handwriting), presence of mirror, neatly arranged clothes, weapon present.
    *   **Homicide:** Signs of struggle (broken furniture), blood drag marks, missing valuables, footprints of assailant.

2.  **Examination of Hands:**
    *   Check for **GSR** (Gunshot Residue) in firearm cases.
    *   Check for **blood spatter** patterns (high velocity back-spatter on the hand holding the gun in suicide).
    *   Check fingernails for foreign skin/hair (assailant's DNA) in homicide.

3.  **Nature of Wounds:**
    *   **Fabricated Wounds:** Usually superficial, parallel, in accessible areas, sparing vital organs, made to support a false charge of assault. Must be differentiated from genuine defense wounds.

4.  **Psychological Autopsy:**
    *   Investigating the victim's mental state, history of depression, previous attempts, or financial/social crisis supports a finding of suicide.
