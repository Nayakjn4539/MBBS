# Stump Complications and Management

The success of an [[amputation]] is defined not just by the surgical removal of a limb, but by the creation of a painless, functional [[amputation stump]] capable of bearing the load of a prosthesis. Complications can significantly delay rehabilitation and prosthetic fitting.

These complications are broadly classified into **Early** (immediate postoperative period) and **Late** (arising after healing or during prosthetic use).

---

### I. Early Complications

These occur during the immediate postoperative period or within the first few weeks of healing.

#### 1. Haematoma
*   **Etiology:** Inadequate hemostasis, loosening of ligatures, or inadequate wound drainage.
*   **Clinical Features:** Pain, swelling, boggy sensation on palpation, and delay in wound healing. It serves as a culture medium for bacteria, increasing the risk of infection.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Small:** May absorb spontaneously.
    *   **Large:** Aspiration or surgical evacuation under strict aseptic conditions.
    *   **Prevention:** Deflate [[tourniquet]] before closure to secure hemostasis; insert a drain during surgery,.

#### 2. Infection
*   **Risk Factors:** Peripheral vascular disease (e.g., diabetes), re-amputation for infection/gas gangrene, or formation of a haematoma.
*   **Clinical Features:** Pain, redness, warmth, discharge, and systemic signs of sepsis.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Mild:** Antibiotics and rest.
    *   **Abscess:** Removal of sutures to allow drainage.
    *   **Severe:** Proximal re-amputation may be required if osteomyelitis or spreading cellulitis occurs.

#### 3. Necrosis of Skin Flaps
*   **Etiology:**
    *   Ischemia (poor blood supply in vascular disease).
    *   Suturing the flaps under excessive tension.
    *   Inadequate skin flaps (too short).
*   **Management:**
    *   **Minor (Edge necrosis):** Allow to heal by secondary intention (scarring).
    *   **Major:** Wedge resection or re-amputation at a higher level.

#### 4. Gaping of Wound
*   **Etiology:** Removal of sutures too early, tension on the wound, or trauma (fall).
*   **Management:** Secondary suturing or allowing healing by granulation (secondary intention).

### II. Late Complications

These usually present during the rehabilitation phase or after prosthetic fitting.

#### 1. Skin Complications
*   **Eczema/Dermatitis:** Often due to allergic reaction to the prosthetic socket material or lack of hygiene.
*   **Furunculosis:** Infection of hair follicles in the stump.
*   **Intertrigo:** Fungal infection in skin creases (common in obese patients or redundant tissue).
*   **Ulceration:** Caused by pressure points from an ill-fitting prosthesis or ischemia.
    *   **Clinical Implication:** Ulcers over the stump end suggest poor vascularity; ulcers elsewhere suggest poor prosthetic fit.

#### 2. Muscle and Soft Tissue Complications
*   **Contractures:**
    *   **Etiology:** Muscle imbalance (flexors are generally stronger than extensors) and poor positioning (e.g., placing a pillow under the knee in BKA).
    *   **Common deformities:** Flexion contracture of the knee (Below Knee Amputation) and Flexion-abduction contracture of the hip (Above Knee Amputation).
    *   **Management:**
        *   *Prevention:* Proper positioning (prone lying), early physiotherapy/mobilization.
        *   *Treatment:* Intensive physiotherapy, traction, or surgical release (tenotomy/capsulotomy).
*   **"Dog Ears":** Excess soft tissue at the corners of the incision, making prosthetic fitting difficult. Requires surgical trimming.

#### 3. Bone Complications
*   **Ring Sequestrum:**
    *   **Pathology:** A ring of dead bone at the distal end of the stump.
    *   **Cause:** Excessive periosteal stripping during surgery, depriving the bone end of blood supply,.
    *   **X-ray:** Shows a ring-like density at the bone end.
    *   **Management:** Removal of the sequestrum.
*   **Bony Spurs (Exostosis):**
    *   **Cause:** Failure to round off/file the bone ends smoothly during surgery.
    *   **Symptoms:** Pain on pressure leading to inability to wear a prosthesis.
    *   **Management:** Surgical excision.

#### 4. Neurological Complications

| Complication | Features | Management |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Neuroma]]** | • A tender nodule formed by a ball of nerve endings at the cut end of a nerve.<br>• **Symptoms:** Electric shock-like pain on local pressure or tapping ([[Tinel's sign]]). | • **Prevention:** During amputation, pull the nerve gently, cut it cleanly, and allow it to retract deep into the soft tissue.<br>• **Treatment:** Injection of phenol/alcohol, surgical excision, or burying the nerve end in bone. |
| **[[Phantom Sensation]]** | • Feeling that the amputated part is still present.<br>• Very common and usually painless.<br>• Patient may try to "walk" on the missing leg. | • Reassurance (usually disappears with time).<br>• Mental imagery. |
| **[[Phantom Limb Pain]]** | • Painful sensation in the absent limb (cramping, burning, crushing).<br>• More common if patient had severe pain *before* amputation. | • **Medical:** Gabapentin, Pregabalin, Amitriptyline, NSAIDs.<br>• **Physical:** Massage, percussion, TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation).<br>• **Psychological:** Mirror therapy. |
| **[[Causalgia]]** | • Severe burning pain, skin sensitivity, and autonomic dysfunction (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome). | • Sympathetic blocks, physiotherapy. |

### III. Principles of Stump Management (Prevention of Complications)

To avoid the complications listed above, strict adherence to management principles is required:

1.  **Ideal Stump Construction:**
    *   **Length:** Preserve ideal length (e.g., 14cm below knee for BKA) for optimal leverage.
    *   **Shape:** Conical shape is ideal for prosthetic fitting.
    *   **Scar:** Should be mobile, painless, and not adherent to the bone.
2.  **Post-operative Care:**
    *   **Rigid Dressing:** Immediate postoperative prosthetic fitting (IPOP) or rigid plaster cast prevents edema and contractures.
    *   **Stump Wrapping:** Use crepe bandages in a **Figure-of-8** manner to reduce edema and shape the stump (conical shape). **Avoid circular bandaging** as it causes a tourniquet effect.
    *   **Hygiene:** Regular washing and drying to prevent skin infections.
3.  **Revision Amputation:**
    *   Indicated if the stump is unsatisfactory (conical, tender, ulcerated, or too short) or has terminal granulation tissue/scarring.

### Mnemonics
