# [[Irritant Poisons (Plants)]] > Calotropis

### Calotropis (Madar/Akdo)

**Synonyms:** Madar, Ak, Akdo, Rubber bush.
**Family:** Asclepiadaceae.

[[Calotropis]] is a tall shrub that grows wild all over India, particularly in wastelands. It is a well-known vegetable irritant and cardiac poison.

### 1. Varieties and Identification
There are two common species:
*   ***Calotropis gigantea:*** Purple flowers.
*   ***Calotropis procera:*** White flowers.

**Physical Features:**
*   **Leaves:** Thick, fleshy, wedge-shaped, sessile with a whitish encrustation.
*   **Juice:** On crushing any part of the plant, a thick, milky, acrid juice ([[Latex]]) exudes. This juice dries into a hard mass.
*   **Toxic Parts:** All parts are poisonous, especially the **root**, **leaves**, and **milky juice**.

### 2. Active Principles
The active principles are [[Cardiac Glycosides]] and others:
1.  **[[Calotropin]]**
2.  **[[Calotoxin]]**
3.  **[[Uscharin]]**
4.  **[[Gigantin]]**

### 3. Mechanism of Action
*   **Local Action:** It acts as a powerful irritant and vesicant (blistering agent) on the skin and mucous membranes.
*   **Systemic Action:** It acts on the heart similar to [[Digitalis]] and stimulates the spinal cord (causing convulsions).

### 4. Clinical Features

#### A. Local Contact
*   **Skin:** Application of the juice causes redness, irritation, and formation of vesicles/pustules. It may lead to weeping eczema.
*   **Eyes:** Accidental splashing of milky juice causes severe [[Conjunctivitis]], corneal ulceration, and can lead to temporary or permanent **blindness**.

#### B. Ingestion (Acute Poisoning)
*   **Gastrointestinal:**
    *   Acrid, bitter taste with burning sensation in mouth, throat, and stomach.
    *   Stomatitis.
    *   Severe vomiting and diarrhea.
    *   Abdominal pain and tenesmus.
*   **Systemic:**
    *   Dilated pupils.
    *   **Tetanus-like convulsions.**
    *   Collapse, weak pulse, and labored respiration.
    *   Delirium followed by death (due to cardiac failure).

---

### 5. Fatal Dose and Fatal Period
*   **Fatal Dose:** Uncertain (highly variable). Approximately >5 ml of juice or a few crushed leaves.
*   **Fatal Period:** usually **6 to 12 hours**.

---

### 6. Treatment
**Ingestion:**
1.  **Stomach Wash:** With warm water or potassium permanganate solution.
2.  **Demulcents:** Egg whites, milk, or butter to soothe the mucosa.
3.  **Symptomatic:** Treat as for [[Cardiac Poisons]] (like Digitalis).
4.  **Pain Management:** Morphine or pethidine for severe pain.

**Eye Contact:**
1.  Immediate and copious irrigation with water or saline.
2.  Topical antibiotics and atropine drops.
3.  Ophthalmology consultation.

### 7. Postmortem Appearances
*   **External:**
    *   Froth at nostrils/mouth.
    *   Pupils dilated.
    *   Vesicles or inflammation on skin (if applied externally).
*   **Internal:**
    *   **Stomach:** Mucosa is inflamed, congested, and softened. **Ulcers** or even perforation may be seen (due to potent irritant action).
    *   **Viscera:** General congestion of liver, kidneys, and brain.
    *   **Heart:** May show signs of arrest in systole (rarely detected at autopsy).

### 8. Medicolegal Aspects
Calotropis is a poison of great medicolegal significance in India:

1.  **[[Cattle Poison]]:** It is widely used to kill cattle. The leaves are mixed with fodder, or a cloth soaked in the juice is inserted into the animal's rectum.
2.  **[[Artificial Bruise]]:** The juice is applied to the skin to create lesions that mimic true bruises to support false charges of assault.
    *   *Differentiation:* Artificial bruises are usually reddish, have irregular margins, show vesication (blisters), intense itching, and the chemical can be detected in the fluid.
3.  **[[Criminal Abortion]]:** An **abortion stick** (twig of the plant or cotton wrapped on a stick soaked in juice) is inserted into the os uteri to induce abortion. This often leads to severe local infection and systemic toxicity.
4.  **Infanticide:** Juice mixed with milk or water is used.
5.  **Arrow Poison:** Used by certain tribes.
6.  **Accidental Poisoning:** Occurs when quacks administer it as a cure for rheumatism, snake bite, or worms.
7.  **Snake Charmers:** The root of *Calotropis procera* is believed to be repulsive to cobras and is used by snake charmers to control them.

#### Mnemonic for Medicolegal Aspects: **"CATTLE"**
*   **C**attle poison (Rectal administration).
*   **A**bortion stick (Abortifacient).
*   **T**oxic to eyes (Blindness).
*   **T**etanus-like convulsions.
*   **L**atex (Milky juice creates artificial bruises).
*   **E**xternal irritant (Vesicant).

### Table: Differentiation between True Bruise and Artificial Bruise (Calotropis)

| Feature | True Bruise | Artificial Bruise (Calotropis) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cause** | Blunt force trauma | Chemical irritant (Latex) |
| **Site** | Anywhere (site of impact) | usually accessible parts |
| **Shape** | Round/irregular | Irregular, bizarre shapes |
| **Color Change** | Present (spectum of colors) | Absent (remains dark brown/red) |
| **Itching** | Absent | **Present (Intense)** |
| **Vesication** | Absent | **Present (Blisters)** |
| **Chemical Analysis** | Negative | Positive for Calotropin |
