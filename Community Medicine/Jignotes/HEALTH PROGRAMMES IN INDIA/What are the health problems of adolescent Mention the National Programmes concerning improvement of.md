# [[HEALTH PROGRAMMES IN INDIA]] > What are the health problems of adolescent? Mention the National Programmes concerning improvement of adolescent health. Outline four important health educational messages for benefit of an adolescent girl.

### Health Problems of Adolescents

Adolescence (10–19 years) is a transitional phase of physical and mental development. The major health problems affecting this group in India include:

1.  **Nutritional Disorders**
    *   **[[Malnutrition]]:** Under-nutrition including stunting and thinness is prevalent.
    *   **[[Nutritional Anaemia]]:** Iron deficiency anaemia is a critical problem, especially among girls, due to increased physiological demand and menstrual losses.
    *   **Micronutrient deficiencies:** Specifically Iodine and Vitamin A deficiency.

2.  **Reproductive and Sexual Health Problems**
    *   **Teenage Pregnancy:** High risk of maternal mortality, morbidity, and poor birth outcomes (low birth weight, preterm) due to biological immaturity.
    *   **[[RTIs/STIs]]:** Increased susceptibility to Sexually Transmitted Infections and Reproductive Tract Infections due to unprotected sexual activity and lack of awareness.
    *   **[[HIV/AIDS]]:** Adolescents are a high-risk group due to experimental and impulsive sexual behavior.
    *   **Menstrual Hygiene:** Lack of knowledge and access to sanitary products leading to infections.

3.  **Behavioral and Mental Health Problems**
    *   **Substance Abuse:** Experimentation with smoking, alcohol, and drugs due to peer pressure.
    *   **Mental Health:** Depression, anxiety, stress, and **suicide** are emerging concerns.
    *   **[[Juvenile Delinquency]]:** Anti-social behavior and conflicts with the law.

4.  **Injuries and Violence**
    *   Road traffic accidents and domestic violence/gender-based violence.

### National Programmes for Adolescent Health

The Government of India has launched several initiatives to address these issues, shifting from a clinic-based approach to a comprehensive community-based approach.

#### 1. [[Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK)]]
Launched in 2014, this is the flagship programme under the National Health Mission (NHM). It broadens the focus beyond sexual/reproductive health to include nutrition, NCDs, and mental health.
*   **Target Group:** 10–19 years (males and females, urban and rural, in-school and out-of-school).
*   **Strategy:** **RMNCH+A** (Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child, and Adolescent Health).
*   **6 Strategic Priorities:**
    1.  Nutrition
    2.  Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH)
    3.  Non-communicable diseases (NCDs)
    4.  Substance misuse
    5.  Injuries and violence (including gender-based violence)
    6.  Mental health
*   **7 Critical Components (7 Cs):** Coverage, Content, Communities, Clinics, Counselling, Communication, Convergence.

#### 2. [[Adolescent Friendly Health Clinics (AFHCs)]]
Also known as *Maitri Clinics*. These provide promotive, preventive, curative, and referral services with privacy and confidentiality.

#### 3. [[Weekly Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation (WIFS)]]
To combat the high prevalence of anaemia.
*   **Intervention:** Supervised administration of **100 mg Elemental Iron and 500 mcg Folic Acid** (Blue Tablet) once a week + biannual deworming (Albendazole 400mg).

#### 4. [[Scheme for Promotion of Menstrual Hygiene]]
Aims to increase awareness regarding menstrual hygiene and ensure access to high-quality sanitary napkins for adolescent girls in rural areas.

#### 5. [[Kishori Shakti Yojana (KSY)]]
Implemented under ICDS to improve the nutritional, health, and social status of adolescent girls (11–18 years) through non-formal education and training.

#### 6. School Health Programme (Ayushman Bharat)
Uses **Health and Wellness Ambassadors** (teachers) to promote health and screen for the 4Ds (Defects, Diseases, Deficiencies, Developmental delays) under [[Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK)]].

**1. Menstrual Hygiene and Sanitation:**
*   Educate her that menstruation is a normal physiological process.

**3. Reproductive Health and Delaying Marriage:**
*   **Delay marriage** until at least the legal age of 18 (preferably 20+ years) to ensure physical and mental maturity.
*   **Delay the first pregnancy** until the age of 20 to reduce the risk of maternal mortality, low birth weight babies, and obstructed labour.

**4. Rubella Vaccination and Personal Safety:**
