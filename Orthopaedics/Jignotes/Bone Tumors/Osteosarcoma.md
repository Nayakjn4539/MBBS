# [[Bone Tumors]] > Osteosarcoma

### Osteosarcoma (Osteogenic Sarcoma)

#### Definition
[[Osteosarcoma]] is a primary malignant tumor of the bone derived from primitive [[mesenchymal cells]], characterized by the formation of **neoplastic osteoid** or immature bone by the tumor cells.

#### Epidemiology
*   **Incidence:** It is the **second most common** primary malignant bone tumor (after [[multiple myeloma]]) and the **most common** primary malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents.
*   **Age:**
    *   **Bimodal distribution:**
        *   **Primary Osteosarcoma:** Peaks in the second decade of life (**10–20 years**), corresponding with the growth spurt.
        *   **Secondary Osteosarcoma:** Occurs in older adults (**>50 years**), usually secondary to pre-existing bone pathology.
*   **Sex:** Males are affected more frequently than females (Ratio 1.5:1 to 2:1).

#### Anatomical Distribution
*   **Predilection:** Primarily affects the **metaphysis** of long bones.
*   **Common Sites:** "Away from the elbow, towards the knee."
    *   **Distal Femur** (Most common).
    *   **Proximal Tibia**.
    *   **Proximal Humerus**.
*   **Rare Sites:** Jaw, skull, and extraskeletal sites.

#### Etiology and Risk Factors
Most cases of primary osteosarcoma are idiopathic, but several risk factors and pre-malignant conditions exist:

1.  **Genetic Factors:**
    *   [[Li-Fraumeni syndrome]] (p53 mutation).
    *   Hereditary [[retinoblastoma]] (Rb gene mutation).
    *   Rothmund-Thomson syndrome.
2.  **Secondary Causes (Pre-existing Bone Pathology):**
    *   **[[Paget's disease of bone]]:** Major cause in the elderly.
    *   **Radiation exposure:** If a dose of >2000 rads is given to osteoprogenitor cells (post-irradiation sarcoma).
    *   [[Fibrous dysplasia]].
    *   Multiple [[enchondromatosis]].
    *   Multiple [[osteochondroma]].

#### Pathology
*   **Gross Appearance:** The tumor is usually large, grayish-white, and gritty (osteoblastic) or soft/cystic (telangiectatic) with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. It typically arises in the medullary cavity and breaks through the cortex.
*   **Microscopy:** The hallmark is the presence of **malignant stromal cells** producing **neoplastic [[osteoid]]** directly without an intervening cartilage phase.
*   **Histological Subtypes:**
    *   **Osteoblastic** (Commonest).
    *   **Chondroblastic**.
    *   **Fibroblastic**.
    *   **Telangiectatic:** Contains large blood-filled spaces; lytic on X-ray.
    *   **Small cell**.

#### Clinical Features
*   **Pain:** The earliest and most constant symptom. Initially intermittent, it becomes constant and severe, typically **worse at night**. It is not relieved by rest.
*   **Swelling:** A palpable mass develops later. It is usually firm, tender, and associated with warmth. The overlying skin may be shiny with **engorged superficial veins**.
*   **Pathological Fracture:** May be the presenting complaint in some cases.
*   **Joint Movement:** May be restricted due to the mechanical block of the tumor mass, though the joint itself is rarely invaded directly.
*   **Constitutional Symptoms:** Fever, weight loss, and malaise are usually late features or associated with metastatic disease.

#### Diagnostic Imaging
**1. Plain Radiograph (X-ray)**
This is the most useful initial investigation.
*   **Location:** Metaphyseal, eccentric or central.
*   **Bone Destruction:** Irregular areas of osteolysis ("moth-eaten" or permeative) mixed with osteosclerosis (new bone formation).
*   **Periosteal Reaction:**
    *   **[[Sunburst appearance]]:** Spicules of reactive bone radiating perpendicularly from the cortex due to rapid tumor growth along Sharpey's fibers.
    *   **[[Codman's triangle]]:** A triangular area of reactive subperiosteal bone at the margin of the tumor where the periosteum is lifted by the tumor mass.
*   **Soft Tissue Mass:** Often visible, sometimes with calcification/ossification.

**2. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)**
*   Essential for local staging.
*   Defines **intramedullary extension** (skip lesions) and **soft tissue involvement**.
*   Helps in planning limb-salvage surgery.

**3. CT Scan**
*   **Chest CT:** Mandatory to detect **pulmonary metastasis** (the most common site of spread).
*   Useful for defining cortical destruction.

**4. Bone Scan (Technetium-99m)**
*   Detects **skip lesions** (metastasis within the same bone) and distant skeletal metastases.

**5. Biopsy**
*   **Definitive diagnosis.**
*   Should be planned carefully to ensure the biopsy track can be excised during definitive surgery.
*   **Core needle biopsy** or **Open biopsy**.

#### Laboratory Investigations
*   **Serum [[Alkaline Phosphatase]] (ALP):** Usually elevated. It has prognostic value; levels correlate with tumor burden and fall after effective treatment. A rise post-treatment suggests recurrence or metastasis.
*   **Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH):** Elevated levels indicate poor prognosis.

#### Differential Diagnosis
| Condition | Key Differentiating Features |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Ewing's Sarcoma]]** | Diaphyseal, younger age (<10), "Onion-peel" periosteal reaction, systemic symptoms (fever) common. |
| **[[Osteomyelitis]]** | Fever, systemic toxicity, involucrum/sequestrum on X-ray. Biopsy shows inflammatory cells. |
| **[[Myositis Ossificans]]** | History of trauma, bone formation matures from periphery to center (zoning phenomenon). |
| **Giant Cell Tumor** | Epiphyseal location, "Soap-bubble" appearance, eccentric. |

#### Treatment
The standard of care is a **multidisciplinary approach** combining chemotherapy and surgery. Osteosarcoma is generally **radio-resistant**.

**1. Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (Pre-operative)**
*   **Goals:** Shrink the tumor, treat micrometastases, and facilitate limb-salvage surgery.
*   **Duration:** Typically 8–12 weeks.
*   **Agents:** High-dose [[Methotrexate]], [[Doxorubicin]] (Adriamycin), [[Cisplatin]], [[Ifosfamide]].
*   **Evaluation:** Tumor necrosis rate is assessed histologically after surgery; >90% necrosis indicates a good prognosis.

**2. Surgical Resection**
*   **Wide Excision (Limb Salvage):** Preferred in >80% of cases. Involves removing the tumor with a cuff of normal tissue. The defect is reconstructed using endoprostheses (megaprostheses) or bone grafts.
*   **Amputation:** Indicated if the tumor encases major neurovascular bundles, for massive tumors where functional limb salvage is impossible, or if infection/pathological fracture precludes salvage.
*   **Rotationplasty:** Specifically for distal femoral tumors in growing children. The ankle serves as the knee joint.

**3. Adjuvant Chemotherapy (Post-operative)**
*   Continued for 6–12 months to eliminate residual microscopic disease and prevent metastasis.

#### Prognosis
*   **Survival:** Before chemotherapy, survival was <20%. With modern multimodal therapy, the **5-year survival rate is 60–75%** for non-metastatic disease.
*   **Poor Prognostic Factors:**
    *   Presence of **metastasis** at diagnosis (Lung is #1 site).
    *   Poor response to chemotherapy (<90% necrosis).
    *   Large tumor volume.
    *   Axial skeleton involvement (pelvis/spine).
    *   Elevated ALP or LDH levels.
