# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Annual parasite incidence [API]

# Annual Parasite Incidence (API)

**Definition**
[[Annual Parasite Incidence]] (API) is defined as the number of **confirmed** malaria cases per thousand population under surveillance in a given year. It is considered a sophisticated measure of malaria incidence in a community.

**Formula**
$$API = \frac{\text{Total Confirmed Malaria Cases during one year}}{\text{Total Population under surveillance}} \times 1000$$

*   **Confirmed Cases:** Includes cases positive for malaria parasite by **Microscopy** (Blood Smear) or **Rapid Diagnostic Test** (RDT).
*   **Denominator:** Mid-year population under surveillance.
*   **Multiplier:** It is always expressed per **1,000** population.

**Relevance and Utility**
1.  **Burden Assessment:** It is currently the **best indicator** to assess the burden of malaria and the progress of the control programme in a community.
2.  **Stratification:** It is the basis for classifying areas into high-risk or low-risk to prioritize resources.
3.  **Vector Control:** It determines the strategy for vector control (e.g., whether to use Indoor Residual Spraying or bed nets).
4.  **Replacement:** It has replaced older, less sensitive indices like Spleen Rate and Infant Parasite Rate for monitoring purposes.

**Operational Efficiency (The ABER Connection)**
For API to be valid, the surveillance mechanism must be efficient. This is cross-checked using the **[[Annual Blood Examination Rate]] (ABER)**.
*   **ABER Formula:** $\frac{\text{No. of slides examined}}{\text{Population}} \times 100$
*   **Rule:** ABER should be **>10%**. If ABER is low, a low API might simply mean "missed cases" rather than low disease burden.

**Stratification of Areas based on API**

**1. Historical Classification (Modified Plan of Operation - MPO)**
*   **API $\ge$ 2:** High Risk Area (Eligible for vector control measures like Spraying/ITBN).
*   **API < 2:** Low Risk Area.

**2. Current Classification (National Framework for Malaria Elimination 2016-2030)**
States and Union Territories (UTs) are categorized based on API to decide the intervention phase:

| Category | Phase | Definition (Criteria) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Category 0** | **Prevention of Re-establishment** | States/UTs with **Zero** indigenous cases of malaria. |
| **Category 1** | **Elimination Phase** | States/UTs with **API < 1**, and **ALL** their districts reporting API < 1. |
| **Category 2** | **Pre-elimination Phase** | States/UTs with **API < 1**, but **SOME** districts reporting API $\ge$ 1. |
| **Category 3** | **Intensified Control Phase** | States/UTs with **API $\ge$ 1**. |

**Mnemonic for Elimination Categories**
To remember the categories for [[Malaria Elimination]]: **"ZEPI"**

*   **Z**ero cases = Category **0**
*   **E**limination = Category **1** (API < **1**, All districts)
*   **P**re-elimination = Category **2** (State < 1, but patchy districts)
*   **I**ntensified Control = Category **3** (API $\ge$ **1**)

---

**Clinical & Public Health Relevance**
*   **High Risk Areas (API > 2):** These areas receive focused interventions like Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) and distribution of Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs).
*   **Epidemic Monitoring:** A sudden rise in API in a previously low API area indicates a potential outbreak or failure of control measures.
