# [[NUTRITION AND HEALTH]] > What is malnutrition Discuss its prevention strategies in terms of different levels of preventions

### Definition of Malnutrition
**Malnutrition** is defined as a pathological state resulting from a relative or absolute deficiency or excess of one or more essential nutrients. It comprises four forms:
1.  **Undernutrition:** Insufficient food intake over an extended period (e.g., [[Marasmus]], [[Kwashiorkor]]).
2.  **Overnutrition:** Consumption of excessive food quantity (e.g., Obesity, Hypervitaminosis).
3.  **Imbalance:** Disproportion among essential nutrients.
4.  **Specific Deficiency:** Relative or absolute lack of an individual nutrient (e.g., [[Vitamin A deficiency]], Iron deficiency anemia).

### Prevention Strategies
The prevention of malnutrition, particularly [[Protein Energy Malnutrition]] (PEM), is approached through different levels of prevention.

#### 1. Primary Prevention
This level signifies intervention in the **pre-pathogenesis phase** (before the disease occurs). It involves two main modes of intervention:

**A. Health Promotion**
These measures are designed to promote general health and well-being.
*   **Maternal Care:** Measures directed to pregnant and lactating women, including education and distribution of supplements.
*   **Promotion of [[Breastfeeding]]:** Encouraging exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months.
*   **Weaning Foods:** Development of low-cost weaning foods; ensuring the child eats more food at frequent intervals.
*   **Family Diet:** Measures to improve the general family diet.
*   **Nutrition Education:** Promotion of correct feeding practices and home economics.
*   **Family Planning:** Spacing of births to ensure maternal health and adequate care for each child.
*   **Family Environment:** Improving the general family environment.

**B. Specific Protection**
These are specific measures to prevent particular deficiencies.
*   **Diet:** The child's diet must contain protein and energy-rich foods. Milk, eggs, and fresh fruits should be given if possible.
*   **[[Immunization]]:** To prevent infections (like Measles) that precipitate malnutrition.
*   **[[Food Fortification]]:** Enriching foods with specific nutrients (e.g., Iodine in salt, Vitamin A in oil).

#### 2. Secondary Prevention
This level aims at **Early Diagnosis and Treatment** to halt the progress of the disease.

*   **Periodic Surveillance:** Regular monitoring to detect early signs.
*   **Growth Monitoring:** Early diagnosis of any lag in growth using [[Growth Charts]]. This is the most practical method to detect underweight for age.
*   **Infection Control:** Early diagnosis and treatment of infections and diarrhea.
*   **Oral Rehydration:** Development of programmes for early rehydration of children with diarrhea to prevent catabolic loss.
*   **Supplementary Feeding:** Development of supplementary feeding programmes (e.g., [[ICDS]]) during epidemics or lean periods.
*   **Deworming:** Treatment of heavily infested children to improve nutrient absorption.

#### 3. Tertiary Prevention
This level involves **Rehabilitation** to limit disability and restore function.

*   **Nutritional Rehabilitation Services:** Specialized care for severe cases.
*   **Hospital Treatment:** Admission for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) with complications.
*   **Follow-up Care:** Long-term monitoring to prevent relapse and ensure catch-up growth.

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Vicious Cycle:** There is a synergistic relationship between malnutrition and infection. Infections (like diarrhea/measles) adversely affect nutritional status, and malnutrition predisposes the child to severe infections.
*   **Iceberg Phenomenon:** Clinical cases like Kwashiorkor and Marasmus represent only the "tip of the iceberg," while the majority of cases in the community are mild to moderate forms of undernutrition which require detection via [[anthropometry]].
