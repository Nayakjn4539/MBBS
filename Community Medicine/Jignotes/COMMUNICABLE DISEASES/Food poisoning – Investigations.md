# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Food poisoning – Investigations

### Investigation of Food Poisoning

The investigation of a [[Food Poisoning]] outbreak is a systematic process aimed at identifying the causative agent, the source of contamination, and preventing further spread. The following steps must be undertaken immediately upon reporting:

#### 1. Secure Complete List and History
The first step is to secure a complete list of all persons involved. This includes **both** those who fell ill and those who remained healthy after sharing the common meal. 

*   **Interviewing:** Administer a questionnaire to all individuals (eaters and non-eaters) covering:
    *   **Food intake:** Detailed history of food items consumed in the previous 2 days and the place of consumption.
    *   **Time:** Exact time of the last meal and time of onset of symptoms.
    *   **Symptoms:** Specific complaints like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, or prostration.
    *   **Personal Data:** Age, sex, occupation, and residence.

#### 2. Clinical Study
Analyze the clinical picture to narrow down the differential diagnosis.
*   **Incubation Period:** Note the time gap between ingestion and first symptom. A short incubation (1-6 hours) suggests **Staphylococcal** or *B. cereus* (emetic) poisoning, while a longer one (12-24 hours) suggests [[Salmonella]].
*   **Symptom Pattern:** Note if the presentation is predominantly vomiting (suggests toxin) or diarrhea (suggests infection). Neurological symptoms (diplopia, dysphagia) point towards [[Botulism]].

> **Clinical Relevance:** 
> Differentiating between **Staphylococcal** poisoning (vomiting, no fever) and **Salmonella** (fever, diarrhea) is crucial for immediate management and tracing the source.

#### 3. Laboratory Investigations
This is vital to incriminate the causative agent.
*   **Sample Collection:**
    *   **Human:** Vomit and stool samples from patients,.
    *   **Food:** Remnants of the suspected food and empty containers.
    *   **Staff:** Stool/urine samples from kitchen employees and food handlers to detect carriers,.
*   **Transport:** Samples must be sent immediately in an **ice box** to the laboratory. Organs from post-mortem cases should be sent in 30% glycerine solution.
*   **Tests Performed:**
    *   Aerobic and anaerobic cultures.
    *   Quantitative analysis: determining total bacterial count and relative numbers of specific pathogens.
    *   **[[Phage typing]]:** Essential for tracing the specific strain of the organism.

#### 4. Environmental Study
Inspect the location where the food was prepared and consumed.
*   **Site Inspection:** Check the kitchen, dining hall, and food storage areas (refrigerators, hot cases).
*   **Hygiene Check:** Look for evidence of rodents, flies, or dust. Assess the general cleanliness and ventilation,.
*   **Food Handlers:** Interview cooks and servers regarding recent illness (diarrhea, boils, sore throat, septic wounds) which could be the source of Staphylococcal or Streptococcal contamination,.

#### 5. Data Analysis
Epidemiological analysis is conducted using time, place, and person distribution.
*   **Food-Specific Attack Rate:** Calculate the attack rate for each food item to identify the vehicle of transmission.
    *   *Formula:* (Number of persons who ate food X and became ill / Total persons who ate food X) $\times$ 100.
    *   The food item with the highest attack rate in eaters and lowest in non-eaters is usually the culprit.
*   **Epidemic Curve:** Construct a curve based on the time of onset to identify the nature of the outbreak (e.g., point source).

#### 6. Special Tests (Animal & Serological)
*   **Animal Experiments:** Rhesus monkeys may be fed food remnants. For suspected [[Botulism]], a saline filtrate of the food is injected into mice (some protected with antitoxin, some not) to test for lethality (Mouse Protection Test).
*   **Blood for Antibodies:** Serological tests on patient blood samples can be used for retrospective diagnosis.
