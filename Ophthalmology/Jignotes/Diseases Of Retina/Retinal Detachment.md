# Diseases of the Retina: Retinal Detachment

**Definition**
[[Retinal detachment]] (RD) is the separation of the **neurosensory retina** from the underlying **retinal pigment epithelium** (RPE) with the accumulation of [[subretinal fluid]] in the potential space between them. This space represents the original primary optic vesicle in embryonic development.

### Classification of Retinal Detachment
Clinico-etiologically, RD is classified into three main types:
1.  **Rhegmatogenous** (Primary) RD
2.  **Tractional** RD
3.  **Exudative** (Secondary/Serous) RD

---

### 1. Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment (RRD)
This is the most common type of retinal detachment. The term is derived from the Greek word *rhegma*, meaning a break or discontinuity.

**Pathogenesis**
It is caused by the interplay of three factors:
1.  **Liquefaction of Vitreous (Syneresis):** The gel turns into fluid.
2.  **Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD):** Separation of the vitreous cortex from the retina.
3.  **Retinal Break:** A hole or tear allows the liquefied vitreous to seep through into the subretinal space. This is often caused by dynamic **vitreoretinal traction**.

**Risk Factors (Predisposing Factors)**
*   **High Myopia:** [[Pathological myopia]] is a common cause.
*   **Aphakia/Pseudophakia:** Following cataract surgery.
*   **Trauma:** Blunt or penetrating ocular injury.
*   **Retinal Degenerations:** Specifically [[Lattice degeneration]], snail track degeneration, and focal pigment clumps.
*   **Systemic:** Marfan’s syndrome, Stickler’s syndrome.

**Clinical Features**
*   **Prodromal Symptoms:**
    *   **Photopsia:** Flashes of light (due to traction on photoreceptors).
    *   **Floaters:** Sudden appearance of black spots (muscae volitantes) or a "cobweb". A sudden shower of black dots indicates vitreous hemorrhage due to a torn vessel.
*   **Symptoms of Detachment:**
    *   "Curtain falling" or shadow appearing in front of the eye.
    *   Sudden painless loss of vision.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Retina:** Appears **grey/opaque** and **convex** (raised anteriorly). It is thrown into folds causing undulations with eye movements.
    *   **Retinal Break:** A horseshoe tear, round hole, or anterior dialysis is visible.
    *   **Shafer’s Sign (Tobacco Dust):** Presence of pigment cells in the anterior vitreous. This is pathognomonic for a retinal break.
    *   **IOP:** Intraocular pressure is usually lower than the fellow eye (hypotony).
    *   **Pupil:** Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect ([[RAPD]]) or Marcus Gunn pupil is present in extensive RD.

> **Clinical Implication:** **Lincoff's Rules** are used to clinically localize the retinal break based on the configuration of the subretinal fluid. For example, in a superior detachment crossing the midline, the break is usually near 12 o'clock.

**Management**
*   **Prophylaxis:** Sealing retinal breaks (without detachment) using **Laser Photocoagulation** or **Cryopexy**.
*   **Surgical Repair:** The goal is to close the break and relieve traction.
    1.  **Pneumatic Retinopexy:** Intravitreal gas injection (SF6 or C3F8) to tamponade the break, followed by cryo/laser.
    2.  **Scleral Buckling:** Placing a silicone band/sponge externally to indent the sclera, relieving traction and closing the break. Subretinal fluid may be drained.
    3.  **Pars Plana Vitrectomy (PPV):** Removal of vitreous, internal drainage of fluid, endolaser, and internal tamponade with **Silicone oil** or long-acting gas.

### 2. Tractional Retinal Detachment (TRD)
Occurs when the retina is mechanically pulled away from the RPE by the contraction of fibrous tissue in the vitreous.

**Etiology**
*   [[Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy]] (PDR) - Most common cause.
*   [[Retinopathy of Prematurity]] (ROP).
*   Penetrating trauma.
*   [[Eales' disease]].
*   Sickle cell retinopathy.

**Clinical Features**
*   **No** photopsia or floaters usually (as breaks are absent).
*   **Retinal Appearance:** The detached retina is **concave**, immobile, and taut.
*   The detachment is more localized and rarely extends to the [[ora serrata]].
*   Highest elevation is at the site of vitreoretinal traction.

**Management**
*   **Pars Plana Vitrectomy (PPV):** To cut vitreous bands/membranes and relieve traction.
*   Internal tamponade with gas or silicone oil.

### 3. Exudative (Serous) Retinal Detachment
Occurs due to the accumulation of fluid beneath the retina caused by inflammatory or vascular lesions, without a retinal break or traction.

**Etiology**
*   **Systemic:** [[Toxaemia of pregnancy]], Renal hypertension.
*   **Ocular Tumors:** [[Choroidal melanoma]] (malignant), Retinoblastoma (exophytic type), Hemangioma.
*   **Inflammatory:** [[Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome]] (VKH), Posterior scleritis, Sympathetic ophthalmitis.
*   **Vascular:** [[Coats' disease]], [[Central Serous Chorioretinopathy]] (CSCR).

**Clinical Features**
*   **Shifting Fluid:** The pathognomonic sign. The subretinal fluid moves with gravity as the patient changes head position.
*   **Retinal Appearance:** Smooth and **convex** (dome-shaped).
*   No retinal breaks or traction bands are seen.
*   **Transillumination Test:** Solid detachment (tumor) is opaque, while simple fluid is transparent.

**Management**
*   **Treat the underlying cause.** (e.g., control blood pressure, treat the tumor, corticosteroids for inflammation).
*   Surgery is usually *not* required for the detachment itself as fluid absorbs once the cause is treated.

### Investigations
1.  **Indirect Ophthalmoscopy:** The investigation of choice (IOC) to visualize the entire retina and locate breaks. Scleral indentation is used to see the periphery.
2.  **B-Scan Ultrasonography (USG):** Essential when media is hazy (e.g., dense cataract or vitreous hemorrhage) to detect RD or tumors.
    *   RRD appears as a highly reflective membrane.
    *   Tumors like choroidal melanoma show a "Collar stud" or mushroom appearance.
3.  **Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT):** Detects subretinal fluid and macular involvement.

### Complications of Chronic RD
*   **Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy (PVR):** Formation of membranes causing fixed folds (Star folds).
*   **Complicated Cataract**.
*   **Uveitis**.
*   **Phthisis Bulbi** (Atrophy of the globe).
*   **Demarcation Lines (High water marks):** Indicates long-standing detachment.

### Easy Mnemonic for RRD Surgery Steps
**DACE**
*   **D**rainage of subretinal fluid.
*   **A**ir injection (Internal tamponade).
*   **C**ryotherapy (to seal the break).
*   **E**xplant (Scleral buckling).
