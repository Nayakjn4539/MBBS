# Diagnostic Nasal Endoscopy (DNE)

**Diagnostic Nasal Endoscopy (DNE)** is a procedure that allows detailed visualization of the internal nasal anatomy, paranasal sinus drainage pathways, and the nasopharynx using an endoscope. It is considered the gold standard for diagnosing sinonasal diseases.

### Instrumentation
The primary instrument used is the **Rigid Nasal Endoscope** (Hopkins rod-lens system).

*   **Optics:** Provides better image clarity, illumination, and wider field of view compared to flexible scopes.
*   **Diameters:**
    *   **4.0 mm:** Standard for adults.
    *   **2.7 mm:** Used for children or adults with narrow nasal cavities/stenosis.
*   **Angles of View:**
    *   **0° (Straight):** General overview, septal evaluation.
    *   **30° (Forward-Oblique):** Most commonly used for visualizing the lateral nasal wall, [[Osteomeatal Complex]], and nasopharynx.
    *   **45° / 70°:** To view the [[Frontal Recess]] and maxillary sinus ostia.

**Flexible Fiberoptic Endoscope:** Used when the patient cannot tolerate a rigid scope, has a severe gag reflex, or for evaluating the larynx/vocal cords simultaneously.

### Preparation and Anesthesia
*   **Position:** The patient can be in a sitting (sniffing position) or supine position.
*   **Decongestion and Anesthesia:**
    *   Nasal cavity is sprayed or packed with a mixture of **4% Lignocaine** (anesthetic) and **Oxymetazoline** or **Adrenaline** (vasoconstrictor).
    *   **Purpose:** To provide analgesia, reduce mucosal edema (improving visibility), and minimize bleeding.

### Technique: The Three Passes
The systematic examination is traditionally described in three passes.

#### 1. First Pass (Floor of Nose)
The endoscope (usually 0°) is passed along the floor of the nasal cavity, between the [[Inferior Turbinate]] and the [[Nasal Septum]].

*   **Structures Visualized:**
    *   **Nasal Vestibule:** Look for furuncles or folliculitis.
    *   **Nasal Septum:** Deviations, spurs, or perforations.
    *   **Inferior Meatus:** Opening of the [[Nasolacrimal Duct]] (Hasner’s valve).
    *   **Nasopharynx:** The scope is advanced posteriorly to visualize:
        *   [[Eustachian Tube]] orifice.
        *   [[Fossa of Rosenmuller]] (site for [[Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma]]).
        *   [[Adenoids]].
    *   **Soft Palate:** Movement can be assessed.

#### 2. Second Pass (Sphenoethmoidal Recess)
The endoscope is withdrawn and passed medial to the [[Middle Turbinate]].

*   **Structures Visualized:**
    *   **Sphenoethmoidal Recess:** Location of the [[Sphenoid Sinus]] ostium.
    *   **Superior Turbinate & Meatus:** Drainage site for posterior ethmoid cells.
    *   **Skull Base:** Olfactory cleft area.

#### 3. Third Pass (Middle Meatus)
This is the most clinically significant pass for sinusitis. The scope (usually 30°) is passed into the middle meatus lateral to the middle turbinate.

*   **Structures Visualized (Osteomeatal Complex):**
    *   **Uncinate Process:** A sickle-shaped bony leaflet.
    *   **Bulla Ethmoidalis:** The largest anterior ethmoid air cell.
    *   **Hiatus Semilunaris:** The gap between the uncinate process and bulla.
    *   **Maxillary Ostium:** Located in the infundibulum (deep to uncinate).
    *   **Frontal Recess:** Drainage pathway for the [[Frontal Sinus]].

> **Mnemonic for Middle Meatus Structures (Lateral to Medial):**
> **L**amina Papyracea -> **U**ncinate Process -> **H**iatus Semilunaris -> **B**ulla Ethmoidalis -> **M**iddle Turbinate. (**L**et **U**s **H**ave **B**ig **M**eals)

### Indications
DNE is indicated for diagnosis, preoperative planning, and postoperative care.

| Category | Specific Indications |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Inflammatory** | Acute or [[Chronic Rhinosinusitis]] (CRS) refractory to therapy.<br>Evaluation of [[Nasal Polyps]].<br>[[Allergic Fungal Sinusitis]]. |
| **Structural** | [[Deviated Nasal Septum]] (DNS), septal spurs.<br>[[Choanal Atresia]]. |
| **Tumors** | Benign: [[Inverted Papilloma]], [[Angiofibroma]].<br>Malignant: [[Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma]], sinonasal malignancies. |
| **Trauma/Leaks** | Localization of [[CSF Rhinorrhea]].<br>Assessment of orbital floor fractures. |
| **Miscellaneous** | Evaluation of [[Epistaxis]] (to locate bleeding points like Sphenopalatine artery).<br>[[Anosmia]] or Hyposmia.<br>Headache/Facial pain evaluation. |

### Contraindications
There are no absolute contraindications, but caution is advised in:
*   Bleeding disorders (Relative contraindication).
*   Uncooperative patients (may require sedation/GA).

### Complications
Though minimally invasive, complications can occur:
*   **Minor:** Pain, minor epistaxis, vasovagal episode (fainting), reaction to local anesthetic.
*   **Major (Rare in diagnostic, more common in surgery):** Injury to the orbit/lamina papyracea, CSF leak (if cribriform plate is traumatized).

### Common Anatomical Variations & Findings
During DNE and subsequent CT planning, specific variations must be noted as they predispose to sinusitis or surgical complications.

1.  **Concha Bullosa:** Pneumatized middle turbinate. Can obstruct the middle meatus.
2.  **Paradoxical Middle Turbinate:** Convexity points laterally instead of medially, narrowing the infundibulum.
3.  **Onodi Cells (Sphenoethmoidal cells):** Posterior ethmoid cells that extend superiorly/laterally to the sphenoid sinus. **Clinical Implication:** High risk of injury to the [[Optic Nerve]] or [[Internal Carotid Artery]] during surgery.
4.  **Haller Cells:** Infraorbital ethmoid cells. Can narrow the maxillary ostium.
5.  **Agger Nasi Cells:** The most anterior ethmoidal air cells; key landmark for the frontal recess.
6.  **Septal Spur:** Sharp projection of the septum, often impinging on the turbinates.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Dodd's Sign / Crescent Sign:** On X-ray or CT, a crescent of air seen behind a mass in the nasopharynx suggests an [[Antrochoanal Polyp]] (which comes from the antrum), differentiating it from an [[Angiofibroma]] arising from the roof.
*   **Double Density Sign:** On CT, heterogeneity within the sinus suggests fungal sinusitis (due to heavy metals in fungal debris).
*   **FESS Planning:** DNE combined with [[CT Scan]] of PNS is the "Roadmap" for [[Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery]] (FESS).
