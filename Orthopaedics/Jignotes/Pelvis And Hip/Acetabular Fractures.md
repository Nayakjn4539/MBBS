# [[Pelvis And Hip]] > Acetabular Fractures

### Acetabular Fractures

[[Acetabular fractures]] are complex intra-articular injuries of the [[pelvis]] that involve the articular surface of the [[hip joint]]. These fractures result from high-energy trauma where the [[femoral head]] acts as a hammer striking the [[acetabulum]] (the anvil).

#### **Anatomy and Column Concept**
The [[acetabulum]] is formed by the fusion of three bones: [[ilium]], [[ischium]], and [[pubis]] at the triradiate cartilage. For surgical classification and management, the acetabulum is conceptually divided into two columns (inverted Y shape):

1.  **Anterior Column (Iliopubic):** Extends from the [[iliac crest]] to the [[pubic symphysis]]. It includes the anterior wall of the acetabulum.
2.  **Posterior Column (Ilioischial):** Extends from the [[sciatic notch]] to the [[ischium]]. It includes the posterior wall of the acetabulum.

#### **Mechanism of Injury**
These are typically high-velocity injuries (e.g., Road Traffic Accidents, falls from height).
*   **Direct Trauma:** Force applied to the greater trochanter.
*   **Indirect Trauma (Dashboard Injury):** The most common mechanism. The knee strikes the dashboard, driving the femur backward.
    *   If the hip is **flexed and adducted**: [[Posterior dislocation of hip]] (often with a posterior wall fracture).
    *   If the hip is **flexed and abducted**: [[Central fracture-dislocation]].
    *   If the hip is **extended**: [[Posterior column fracture]].

#### **Classification (Judet and Letournel)**
This system categorizes fractures based on the involvement of the columns and walls.

**1. Elementary Fractures (5 Types)**
*   **Posterior Wall Fracture:** Most common type. Involves the posterior rim; often associated with posterior hip dislocation.
*   **Posterior Column Fracture:** Fracture line runs from the greater sciatic notch down through the obturator foramen.
*   **Anterior Wall Fracture:** Involves the anterior rim.
*   **Anterior Column Fracture:** Separates the anterior segment from the rest of the pelvis.
*   **Transverse Fracture:** A horizontal fracture line crossing both columns, dividing the innominate bone into superior (iliac) and inferior (pubic/ischial) segments.

**2. Associated Fractures (5 Types)**
Complex combinations of elementary fractures:
*   Posterior column + Posterior wall.
*   Transverse + Posterior wall.
*   T-shaped fracture (Transverse fracture with a vertical split into the obturator foramen).
*   Anterior column/wall + Posterior hemitransverse.
*   **Associated Both Column Fracture:** Both columns are fractured, and the articular segment is floating (detached from the axial skeleton). This shows the **Spur Sign** on X-ray.

#### **Clinical Features**
*   **History:** High-energy trauma (RTA, fall from height).
*   **Symptoms:** Severe [[hip pain]], inability to move the limb or bear weight.
*   **Signs:**
    *   Limb may be shortened and internally rotated (if associated with posterior dislocation).
    *   Local tenderness.
    *   **[[Morel-Lavallee lesion]]:** A closed internal degloving injury over the greater trochanter where subcutaneous tissue separates from the underlying fascia, filling with hematoma/liquefied fat.
*   **Neurovascular Assessment:** Critical to assess the [[sciatic nerve]] (foot drop, sensation) and femoral vessels.

**Clinical Implication:** Always examine for associated injuries (head, chest, abdomen) as these are usually polytrauma patients. The "FAST scan" should be utilized to rule out intra-abdominal bleeding.

#### **Investigations**

**1. Plain Radiographs**
*   **AP View of Pelvis:** General assessment of the pelvic ring and both hips.
*   **Judet Views (45° Oblique views):**
    *   **Obturator Oblique:** Shows the **Anterior column** and **Posterior wall**.
    *   **Iliac Oblique:** Shows the **Posterior column** and **Anterior wall**.

**Mnemonic for Judet Views:**
*   **I**liac Oblique sees the **P**osterior Column (**I** see **P**ee).
*   **O**bturator Oblique sees the **A**nterior Column.

**2. Computed Tomography ([[CT Scan]])**
*   **Mandatory** for characterizing the fracture pattern (2D and 3D reconstructions).
*   Identifies intra-articular loose fragments.
*   Assesses the congruity of the femoral head and acetabular dome.
*   Rules out marginal impaction.

#### **Management**

**Principles:**
1.  Restore the congruity of the articular surface.
2.  Stable fixation to allow early mobilization.

**1. Conservative Management**
*   **Indications:**
    *   Undisplaced fractures (< 2mm displacement).
    *   Fractures where the weight-bearing dome is intact (Roof arc angle > 45°).
    *   Secondary congruence (the femoral head and acetabular fragments are congruent despite displacement).
    *   Medical contraindications to surgery (elderly, severe comorbidities).
*   **Method:** [[Skeletal traction]] (longitudinal and/or lateral) for 6–8 weeks to maintain joint space, followed by non-weight bearing mobilization.

**2. Operative Management**
*   **Indications:**
    *   Displaced fractures (> 2mm) involving the weight-bearing dome.
    *   Unstable fractures (e.g., posterior wall fracture > 40-50% of the surface).
    *   Incarcerated intra-articular fragments.
    *   Irreducible fracture-dislocations.
*   **Timing:** Ideally within 5–7 days once the patient is hemodynamically stable.
*   **Surgical Approaches:**
    *   **[[Kocher-Langenbeck Approach]]:** (Posterior) Used for posterior wall and posterior column fractures.
    *   **[[Ilioinguinal Approach]]:** (Anterior) Used for anterior wall/column fractures.
    *   **[[Iliofemoral Approach]]:** Extended approach for complex fractures.
*   **Fixation:** [[Open Reduction and Internal Fixation]] (ORIF) using reconstruction plates and screws (lag screws).

#### **Complications**

**Early:**
*   **[[Sciatic Nerve Injury]]:** Particularly with posterior fracture-dislocations or iatrogenic during posterior approach surgery (retractor injury).
*   **Infection:** Surgical site infection.
*   **Thromboembolism:** [[Deep Vein Thrombosis]] (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE) are high risks due to pelvic trauma and immobility.
*   **Blood Loss:** Significant hemorrhage from the fracture surfaces and pelvic venous plexus.

**Late:**
*   **[[Heterotopic Ossification]]:** Formation of bone in soft tissues, especially after the Kocher-Langenbeck approach. Prophylactic Indomethacin or radiotherapy may be used.
*   **[[Avascular Necrosis]] (AVN):** Of the femoral head due to disruption of blood supply.
*   **Post-traumatic [[Osteoarthritis]]:** Due to damage to articular cartilage or imperfect reduction (step-off in the joint surface).
*   **Chondrolysis:** Rapid destruction of cartilage.
