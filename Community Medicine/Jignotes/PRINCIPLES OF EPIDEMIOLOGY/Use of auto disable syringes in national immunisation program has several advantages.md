# [[PRINCIPLES OF EPIDEMIOLOGY]] > Use of auto disable syringes in national immunisation program has several advantages

### Use of Auto-Disable (AD) Syringes in National Immunization Program

The introduction of [[Auto-Disable (AD) Syringes]] into the **Universal Immunization Programme (UIP)** in 2005 marked a significant shift in injection safety standards. These syringes are designed to prevent reuse, thereby breaking the chain of transmission of blood-borne pathogens.

### 1. Key Advantages

The use of AD syringes offers a "triad of safety" for the recipient, the provider, and the community.

*   **Prevention of Reuse (Single Use Assurance):** The primary mechanism of an [[AD Syringe]] is that the plunger locks automatically after a single use, making it impossible to withdraw the plunger again. This physical locking mechanism prevents the reuse of contaminated equipment, significantly reducing the transmission of blood-borne viruses like **[[HIV]]**, **[[Hepatitis B]]**, and **[[Hepatitis C]]**,.
*   **Accuracy of Dosage:** AD syringes are pre-set to lock at a specific volume (usually **0.1 ml** for [[BCG]] and **0.5 ml** for others). The plunger automatically stops when the necessary dose has been drawn, ensuring the child receives the exact recommended dose without manual estimation errors.
*   **Reduction of Injection Abscesses:** By ensuring a sterile, single-use needle for every injection, the incidence of local reactions, such as sterile abscesses or sepsis due to non-sterile practices, is drastically reduced.
*   **Operational Efficiency (Bundling):** Under the UIP, the concept of **[[Bundling]]** is applied. This means vaccines are always supplied with corresponding quantities of AD syringes, diluents, and reconstitution syringes. This prevents shortages and ensures that a new syringe is always available for every dose.
*   **Prevention of illicit Recycling:** Since the syringe cannot be reused, it discourages the retrieval of used syringes from waste dumps for repackaging and selling in the black market, protecting the wider community.

### 2. Mechanism and Correct Usage

To ensure the advantages are realized, specific handling techniques are required,:

| DOs | DON'Ts |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Check Packaging:** Ensure the peel pack is intact before use. | **Do NOT move plunger:** Do not pull the plunger back and forth before use (it may lock). |
| **Fixed Dose:** Pull plunger back; it stops automatically at the fixed dose (0.5 ml/0.1 ml). | **Do NOT inject air:** Do not inject air into the vial as it may lock the syringe or trap bubbles. |
| **Expel Bubbles:** Tap the barrel upright to remove air bubbles. | **Do NOT Recapping:** Never recap the needle after use to prevent needle-stick injury. |

### 3. Disposal and Waste Management

The advantage of AD syringes is incomplete without safe disposal. The disposal workflow is strictly defined to prevent injury,:

1.  **Immediate Cut:** Immediately after injection, the needle and hub are cut using a **[[Syringe Hub Cutter]]**.
2.  **Segregation:**
    *   **Cut Hub/Needle:** Drops directly into the translucent container of the hub cutter.
    *   **Plastic Barrel:** Disposed of in the **Red Bag/Bin** (for autoclaving/recycling).
3.  **Final Disposal:** The cut needles/sharps are disposed of in a **[[Safety Pit]]** (a concrete-lined pit with a locked cover).

### Clinical Relevance: "The Injection Safety Triad"

*   **Recipient:** Protected from blood-borne infections (HIV/HBV) and local abscesses.
*   **Health Worker:** Protected from needle-stick injuries (if hub cutters are used correctly without recapping).
*   **Community:** Protected from environmental pollution and the illegal recycling of medical waste.

### Mnemonic: **LOCKS**

*   **L** - **L**ocks automatically (Single use).
*   **O** - **O**ptimal Dose (Fixed 0.5ml/0.1ml).
*   **C** - **C**hecks Infection (HIV/Hep B).
*   **K** - **K**it bundling (Supplied with vaccines).
*   **S** - **S**afety Pit disposal (via Hub Cutter).
