# [[DEMOGRAPHY AND FAMILY PLANNING]] > Family physician

### Family Physician (General Practitioner)

The [[Family Physician]] or General Practitioner (GP) is often described as the **backbone of the healthcare delivery system**. Unlike specialists who focus on specific organs or diseases, the family physician is concerned with the "whole person" and treats the **family as the unit of care**.

They provide **comprehensive** and **personalized** care, acting as the first point of contact for individuals within the health system.

#### **Definition and Concept**
*   A **Family Physician** is a legally qualified doctor who provides continuous medical care to patients and their families, irrespective of age, sex, or type of disease.
*   **Unit of Practice:** The family is considered the "unit of living" or "unit of illness".
*   **Philosophy:** Dr. Francis Peabody stated that the specialization in medicine had fragmented care, calling for a return to the general physician.

#### **Core Components of Family Medicine**
The practice of a family physician revolves around three essential components:
1.  **Primary Care** (Preventive and Curative)
2.  **Emergencies**
3.  **Referrals**

#### **1. Curative Functions**
*   **Diagnosis and Treatment:** Diagnose and treat common ailments (e.g., respiratory infections, diarrhea) and chronic conditions (e.g., [[Hypertension]], Diabetes).
*   **Minor Surgery:** Perform minor surgical, obstetric, and ENT procedures.
*   **Emergency Care:** Handle medical, surgical, or obstetric emergencies (e.g., shock, acute abdomen, dehydration) until stabilized or referred.
*   **Clinical Sense:** Rely on clinical skills with minimal laboratory tests to diagnose illnesses.

#### **2. Preventive and Promotive Functions**
This is a critical area where the Family Physician integrates [[Community Medicine]] into daily practice:
*   **Immunization:** Administer vaccines and advise on the [[National Immunization Schedule]].
*   **Maternal and Child Health ([[MCH]]):** Provide antenatal, natal, and postnatal care.
*   **Health Education:** Educate patients on nutrition, hygiene, and lifestyle modifications during illness when they are most receptive.
*   **Notification:** Notify health authorities about notifiable communicable diseases.
*   **Vital Statistics:** Assist in the registration of births and deaths.

#### **3. Role in Demography and Family Planning**
Given the context of population stabilization, the Family Physician plays a pivotal role:
*   **Counseling:** Advise couples on the **Small Family Norm** and appropriate spacing methods.
*   **Services:** Provide contraceptives (condoms, oral pills) and facilitate access to sterilization services.
*   **Medical Termination of Pregnancy ([[MTP]]):** Inform women about the MTP Act and facilitate safe abortion services if required.
*   **Motivation:** Motivate eligible couples for family planning as they have established trust and rapport.

#### **4. Referral Services**
The GP must know their limitations and refer patients to specialists when:
*   Diagnosis is uncertain or requires sophisticated investigation (e.g., cancer).
*   The patient is not responding to treatment.
*   Specialized surgery or management is required.

### **Community Skills of a Family Physician**
To be successful and effective, a GP needs specific community skills:
*   **Knowledge of the Community:** Understanding local beliefs, customs, and health practices.
*   **Knowledge of Indigenous Systems:** Awareness of local [[AYUSH]] practices to guide patients correctly.
*   **Humanistic Approach:** Treating the patient as a human being, not just a case.
*   **Leadership:** Guiding the community in National Health Programs (e.g., Malaria, TB control).

**Clinical Relevance:**
The Family Physician is often the **doctor of first contact**. Their ability to diagnose early (e.g., spotting [[Tuberculosis]] symptoms or early signs of cancer) and manage chronic diseases prevents complications and reduces the burden on tertiary hospitals.
