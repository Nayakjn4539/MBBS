| Disease name | Causative organisms | Agent/vector | Agent factors | Source of infection | Infectivity | Secondary attack rate | Vector control measures | Age of host | Type of immunity | Special Effects during pregnancy if any | Environmental factors | Transmission | Incubation period | Clinical features | Complications | Diagnosis(all methods) | Prevention |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Syphilis | Treponema pallidum (spirochaete) | Bacterium | Dies rapidly outside the body; killed by drying/heating. Sensitive to penicillin. Synthetic steroids may be used in treatment. | Patients with primary chancre, condylomata, or mucous patches; human cases and carriers. | Highly infectious in primary and secondary stages; ends within 24 hours of penicillin therapy. | Infection occurs in approximately 10% of cases after exposure. | Not applicable | All ages; predominantly sexually active adults (15–29 years). Women in reproductive age (15–49 years). | No natural immunity; resistance develops gradually after infection; partial immunity from related diseases like yaws. | Transplacental transmission (congenital syphilis) after 4th month; can cause stillbirth, neonatal death, jaundice, anemia, or abortion. | Social environment (promiscuity), urbanization, industrialization, and international travel. | Direct contact (sexual intercourse, kissing), transplacental (vertical), and blood transfusion. | 10 days to 10 weeks (average 3 weeks); range 9–90 days. | Primary: Hard chancre, painless bubo; Secondary: skin rashes, sore throat; Tertiary: gummata, neuro-syphilis. Genital ulcers. | Cardiovascular involvement, neuro-syphilis, gummata in internal organs, congenital defects in newborns. | Dark field microscopy; Serological tests: VDRL, RPR, FTA-ABS, specific antitreponemal antibodies; Syndromic management. | Health/sex education, safe sex (condoms), screening during pregnancy, treatment of cases/contacts, Penicillin. |
| AIDS(HIV) | Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1 and HIV-2) | Viral agent | Retrovirus; integrates into host genome; destroyed by heat, hypochlorite, and alcohol. Mutates rapidly. | Infected human blood, semen, vaginal secretions, breast milk, and CSF; cases and carriers. | High during window period and advanced stage; 0.1 ml infected blood needed for transmission. | Sexual (0.1–1.0%); Needle stick (0.3%); Blood transfusion (90–95%). | Not applicable (not vector-borne). | All ages; predominantly 20–49 years. Youth and women increasingly vulnerable. | Cellular immunodeficiency; depletion of CD4 count; host remains vulnerable to life-threatening infections. | Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) (20–50% risk); maternal smoking enhances transmission; prone to cervical cancer. | Poverty, gender disparity, low literacy, migration, stigma, and overcrowding (for TB co-infection). | Sexual contact (anal, vaginal, oral), blood contact (needles, transfusion), and vertical (transplacental/breastfeeding). | Acute illness at 6 weeks; asymptomatic stage 7–10 years; varies (months to years). | Weight loss (>10%), chronic diarrhea, fever, persistent cough, lymphadenopathy, opportunistic infections (Candidiasis). | Kaposi's sarcoma, B-cell lymphoma, AIDS dementia complex, wasting syndrome, TB co-infection, death. | Serology (ELISA, Western Blot); Rapid tests; PCR (DNA/RNA); p24 antigen; CD4 count; Viral load. | Safe sex (condoms), blood safety, avoiding needle sharing, PPTCT (ART), Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), PEP. |
| Gonorrhea | Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Diplococci) | Bacterial agent | Rapid spread of penicillin-resistant strains (PPNG). | Untreated cases, especially asymptomatic women; infected genital tract/discharges. | High infectivity; chemotherapy renders noninfective within hours (except resistant strains). | 20–35% for men after single exposure; approximately double for women. | Not applicable | Predominantly sexually active young adults (highest rates in 20–24 year-olds). | No specific lasting immunity mentioned as protective. | Ophthalmia neonatorum (neonatal conjunctivitis), sepsis, pneumonia, or neonatal death. | Unsafe sex practices; social stigma, urbanization, and international travel. | Sexual intercourse (vaginal, oral, anal); vertical (during childbirth); indirect via infected towels (rare). | 2 to 7 days (usually 3 to 5 days); range up to 8 days. | Urethritis (pus), cervicitis, vaginal discharge, pelvic pain, pharyngitis, conjunctivitis. | Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), salpingitis, tubal infertility, urethral stricture, ectopic pregnancy. | Gram-stain of smears (gram-negative intracellular diplococci); cultures (G.C culture); Syndromic management. | Health/sex education, condoms, contact treatment, eye hygiene for newborns, Cefixime/Azithromycin. |
| Genital herpes | Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1 or HSV-2) | Viral agent | Human alpha herpesvirus; latent infection where virus lies dormant in host. | Active vesicles, body fluids, or subclinical viral shedding from infected persons. | Highly infectious during active outbreaks (vesicular eruptions) and subclinical shedding. | Not in source | Not applicable | Primarily sexually active groups (15–44 years). | No permanent immunity; virus remains latent in the body with recurrent ulcerative episodes. | Risk of neonatal herpes; active lesions at labor require Caesarean section; transplacental risk. | Promiscuity and general social factors affecting the spread of STDs. | Direct contact (skin-to-skin, mucosa-to-mucosa), sexual intercourse, and vertical (during delivery). | 2 to 12 days; initial papule/vesicles appear within 2–3 days. | Painful multiple blisters (vesicles), ulcers, and papular lesions on genitalia; often recurrent. | Increased risk of HIV acquisition; neonatal infection; aseptic meningitis. | Clinical recognition of vesicles; Lab tests for HSV; Syndromic management (Genital ulcer algorithm). | Antivirals (Acyclovir, Valacyclovir), condoms, health education, Caesarean delivery for active lesions. |
| Lymphogranuloma venereum | Chlamydia trachomatis (serovars L1, L2, L3) | Bacterial agent | Obligatory intracellular bacteria (TRIC agents); reproduces only within living cells. | Infected persons with open lesions or genital discharges. | Communicable during sexual activity while lesions are present; generally low infectivity. | Not in source | Not applicable | Sexually active adults (commonly 15–49 years). | Not in source | Doxycycline is contraindicated; use Erythromycin. | Endemic in tropics; more prevalent in Southern Indian states (TN, AP, Karnataka). | Direct sexual contact with lesions or infected mucosa. | 3 to 30 days (average 7 to 12 days). | Small painless ulcer; swelling of groin lymph nodes (inguinal bubo); anorectal stricture. | Extensive lymphatic damage, elephantiasis of genitalia, rectal stricture, proctitis. | Frei's test (skin sensitivity); biopsy; inclusion bodies; Syndromic management (Inguinal Bubo algorithm). | Safe sex, condoms, education, Doxycycline (21 days), Erythromycin, partner treatment. |
| Donovanosis | Calymmatobacterium granulomatis (Klebsiella granulomatis) | Bacterial agent | Intracellular gram-negative bacterium; also known as Granuloma inguinale. | Lesions of infected persons. | Direct contact with lesions; low to moderate clinical severity but persistent. | Demonstrated in 40% of spouses of married cases. | Not applicable | Sexually active adults in reproductive age. | Not in source | Not in source | Warm, moist skin folds favor lesions; endemic in coastal areas (TN, AP, Odisha). | Presumably direct contact with lesions during sexual activity. | Unknown; range probably between 1 and 12 weeks (8–80 days). | Hard papule that ulcerates; beefy red velvety granulations; painless floor; bleeds on contact. | Genital disfigurement and extensive tissue destruction. | Demonstrating "Donovan bodies" in tissue scrapings/smears; biopsy; clinical examination. | Safe sex, condoms, education, partner treatment, Azithromycin, Doxycycline. |
