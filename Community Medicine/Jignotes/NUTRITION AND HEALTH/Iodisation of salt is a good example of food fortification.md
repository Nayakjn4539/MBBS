# [[NUTRITION AND HEALTH]] > Iodisation of salt is a good example of food fortification

### Iodisation of Salt: A Classic Example of Food Fortification

[[Food fortification]] is the process of adding nutrients to food (in relatively small quantities) to maintain or improve the quality of the diet of a group, a community, or a population. **Iodisation of salt** is considered the most successful example of this public health strategy globally and in India.

#### 1. Why Salt is Chosen as the Vehicle?
To qualify as a suitable vehicle for fortification, the food item must fulfill specific criteria. Salt is chosen because:
*   **Universal Consumption:** It is consumed by all sections of the population—rich or poor, urban or rural—regardless of dietary habits.
*   **Constant Intake:** The daily consumption of salt is fairly constant per person (approx. 10–15g/day in India), making it easy to calculate the dosage of iodine required.
*   **No Change in Properties:** The addition of iodine does not change the appearance, taste, smell, or consistency of the salt.
*   **Economics:** It is cheap, and the cost of fortification is very low, keeping the final product affordable.
*   **Technical Feasibility:** The technology for mixing iodine with salt is simple and can be implemented in large-scale industries as well as small-scale units.

> **Mnemonic for Ideal Vehicle (SALT):**
> *   **S**table consumption (doesn't fluctuate much)
> *   **A**ffordable and Accessible
> *   **L**ooks and tastes the same
> *   **T**echnically easy to mix

#### 2. The Chemistry of Iodisation
*   **Compound Used:** While Potassium Iodide (KI) can be used, **Potassium Iodate ($KIO_3$)** is preferred in tropical countries like India.
*   **Reason:** Potassium Iodate is more stable and withstands moisture, heat, and impurities better than iodide, ensuring better retention during transport and storage in humid climates.

#### 3. Standards of Iodisation (Under PFA Act/FSSAI)
To ensure that the consumer receives the recommended daily allowance of iodine (150 mcg for adults), specific levels are mandated to account for losses during transit and storage.

| Level | Required Iodine Content | Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **At Production Point** | Not less than **30 ppm** (parts per million) | To account for losses during transport/storage. |
| **At Consumer Level** | Not less than **15 ppm** | To ensure adequate physiological intake. |

#### 4. Public Health Goal: Universal Salt Iodisation (USI)
The primary objective is the prevention and control of [[Iodine Deficiency Disorders (IDD)]].
*   **Scope:** IDD is not just about **Goiter**; it includes a spectrum of disabilities like **Cretinism**, deaf-mutism, mental retardation, and spontaneous abortions.
*   **Strategy:** The [[National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Programme (NIDDCP)]] aims to replace all edible common salt with iodised salt.
*   **Success Indicator:** A community is considered to have effectively controlled IDD if >90% of households are consuming adequately iodised salt.

#### 5. Double Fortified Salt (DFS)
*   **Concept:** A newer innovation developed by the **National Institute of Nutrition (NIN)**, Hyderabad.
*   **Composition:** It is salt fortified with both **Iron and Iodine**.
*   **Formula:** It contains Salt + Potassium Iodate + Ferrous Sulphate + Sodium Hexametaphosphate (stabilizer).
*   **Impact:** It fights two major public health problems simultaneously: [[Iron Deficiency Anemia]] and IDD.
*   **Dosage:** 1 gram of DFS provides approximately **40 mcg of Iodine** and **1 mg of Iron**.

#### 6. Monitoring Quality
*   **Spot Testing:** Rapid testing kits are available for field workers (ASHAs/ANMs). Adding a drop of the test solution to the salt turns it **purple/blue** if iodine is present.
*   **Biochemical Monitoring:** The **Urinary Iodine Excretion (UIE)** levels in the population are the principal indicator of the actual impact of the iodisation program.

**Clinical Relevance:**
**Neonatal Hypothyroidism** is the most preventable cause of mental retardation. The widespread use of iodised salt is a specific protection measure (Primary Prevention) to eliminate this tragedy. In areas of endemic goiter, iodised salt is the most cost-effective long-term solution.
