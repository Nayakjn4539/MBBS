# [[Asphyxia]] > Strangulation

### Definition
[[Strangulation]] is a form of violent asphyxia caused by the constriction of the neck by a ligature or other means without suspending the body. The constricting force is applied by an external agent (hand, ligature, arm, stick) rather than the weight of the victim's body.

### Classification
1.  **Ligature Strangulation:** Constriction by a cord-like object (rope, wire, saree, etc.).
2.  **[[Throttling]] (Manual Strangulation):** Compression of the neck by human hands.
3.  **Mugging:** Strangulation by holding the neck in the bend of the elbow or knee.
4.  **Garroting:** A ligature is thrown around the neck and tightened, often with a lever or stick (Spanish Windlass) to tighten the knot.
5.  **Bansdola:** Compression of the neck between two sticks (bamboos), one across the front and one behind, which are squeezed together.

### Causes of Death
The mechanism of death is often a combination of factors:
1.  **Asphyxia:** Occlusion of the airway (larynx/trachea) or elevation of the tongue blocking the pharynx.
2.  **Venous Congestion:** Occlusion of jugular veins leading to cerebral stagnation and hypoxia.
3.  **Cerebral Ischemia/Anoxia:** Occlusion of carotid arteries cutting off blood supply to the brain.
4.  **Reflex [[Vagal Inhibition]]:** Stimulation of the carotid sinus or vagus nerve causing sudden cardiac arrest. This accounts for about half of the deaths and may lack classic asphyxial signs.

### Autopsy Findings

#### A. External Findings
**1. The Ligature Mark (in Ligature Strangulation):**
*   **Position:** Usually situated **lower down** in the neck, at or below the level of the thyroid cartilage.
*   **Direction:** The mark is **transverse** (horizontal) and completely encircles the neck.
*   **Continuity:** It is usually continuous, but may be interrupted by clothing, hair, or the victim's fingers trying to pull it away.
*   **Appearance:** A groove or furrow that turns parchment-like (brown/dry) after drying. The base is often soft and reddish.
*   **Multiplicity:** Multiple turns may be seen; marks may cross each other.

**2. Manual Strangulation Marks (in Throttling):**
*   **Bruises:** Produced by finger pads. Round or oval bruises (1.5 to 2 cm), often looking like "Six Penny Bruises".
*   **Abrasions:** Crescentic or linear abrasions caused by fingernails (of the assailant or the victim trying to defend themselves).
*   **Pattern:** If the right hand is used from the front, a single thumb bruise is seen on one side (usually the victim's right) and multiple finger bruises on the other.

**3. General Asphyxial Signs (marked in strangulation):**
*   **Face:** Congested, puffy, swollen, and cyanosed (blue/purple).
*   **Petechiae ([[Tardieu spots]]):** Prominent in the scalp, eyelids, conjunctivae, and face.
*   **Tongue:** Often swollen, bruised, dark-colored, and protruded; may be bitten.
*   **Bleeding:** Bloody froth from mouth/nose and bleeding from ears may be seen.
*   **Involuntary Discharge:** Urine and feces discharge is common.

#### B. Internal Findings
**1. Soft Tissues:**
*   **Extravasation:** Extensive bruising and hemorrhage in the subcutaneous tissues and muscles (strap muscles, sternomastoid) of the neck.
*   **Carotid Arteries:** Intimal damage is rare compared to hanging, but may occur with narrow ligatures.

**2. Skeletal Injuries:**
*   **[[Hyoid Bone Fracture]]:** Occurs in 10–15% of cases (more common in the elderly due to calcification/ossification).
    *   **Mechanism:** Anteroposterior compression causes the greater horns to fracture with **inward displacement** (adduction fracture), unlike the outward (abduction) fracture seen in hanging.
*   **Thyroid Cartilage:** Fracture is more common than hyoid fracture in strangulation.
*   **Cricoid Cartilage:** Fracture is almost exclusively seen in throttling (manual strangulation).

**3. Viscera:**
*   Larynx and trachea are congested with frothy blood-stained mucus.
*   Lungs show marked congestion, edema, and subpleural hemorrhages (Tardieu spots).
*   Emphysematous bullae (silvery spots) on the lung surface are common.

### Difference between Hanging and Ligature Strangulation

| Feature | [[Hanging]] | [[Ligature Strangulation]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Constricting Force** | Weight of the body | External force (hands/ligature) |
| **Ligature Mark Direction** | Oblique, non-continuous (gap at knot), rises to a peak | Transverse, continuous, completely encircling |
| **Level of Ligature** | High up in the neck (above thyroid) | Low down (level of or below thyroid) |
| **Subcutaneous Tissue** | White, hard, glistening under mark | Ecchymoses/bruising common under mark |
| **Neck Muscles** | Injury rare/slight | Injury/rupture common and extensive |
| **Hyoid Bone Fracture** | Fracture with **outward** displacement (Abduction) | Fracture with **inward** displacement (Adduction) |
| **Saliva Dribbling** | Present (Diagnostic of antemortem hanging) | Absent |
| **Face** | Usually pale | Congested, cyanosed, petechiae common |
| **Involuntary Discharge** | Less common | More common (urine/feces) |
| **Thyroid Cartilage** | Injury rare | Injury common |
| **Carotid Intima** | Transverse tears ([[Amussat's Sign]]) common | Rare |

### Medicolegal Aspects
1.  **Homicide:** Strangulation (especially throttling) is a very common method of homicide. If a ligature is used, the presence of a complex knot (e.g., reef knot) or multiple turns suggests homicide.
2.  **Suicide:** Rare. It is difficult because consciousness is lost rapidly, causing the hands to relax and the ligature to loosen. It requires a mechanism to maintain tension after loss of consciousness (e.g., using a stick to twist the cord—Spanish Windlass).
3.  **Accident:** Can occur when clothing (scarves, neckties) gets caught in machinery or wheels. Umbilical cord strangulation can occur in utero.
4.  **Sexual Asphyxia:** Auto-erotic strangulation (usually hanging or plastic bag) may mimic homicide/suicide. Features include padding at the neck, nudity, erotica, and evidence of sperm.
5.  **Pseudo-strangulation:** Marks on the neck of infants/obese people due to skin folds, or tight collars in decomposing bodies, can simulate strangulation marks.

### Mnemonics
*   **Throttling Findings:** "**C**hoking **H**ands **O**n **K**iller **E**xertion"
    *   **C**rescentic abrasions (Nail marks)
    *   **H**yoid bone fracture (Inward)
    *   **O**edema of glottis/face
    *   **K**nuckles causes bruises (Six-penny bruises)
    *   **E**xtravasation of blood (subcutaneous)

*   **Differences in Hyoid Fracture:**
    *   **H**anging = **H**igh (Above thyroid) & **O**utward fracture.
    *   **S**trangulation = **S**queezing **I**nward fracture.
