# Ophthalmic Lenses (Surgical Equipment)

In the context of ophthalmic surgery, lenses are categorized into two broad groups: **Lenses used for Visualization** (to view structures during surgery or laser procedures) and **Implantable Lenses** (Intraocular Lenses) which are permanently placed inside the eye.

---

### I. Lenses for Visualization (Diagnostic & Surgical)

These lenses are essential for viewing specific anatomical structures like the [[Anterior Chamber Angle]], [[Retina]], and [[Vitreous]] during surgical or laser interventions.

#### 1. Gonioscopy Lenses (Goniolenses)
These are used to visualize the angle of the anterior chamber.

*   **Principle:** They overcome the total internal reflection of light at the corneal surface.
*   **Types:**

| Type | Characteristics | Examples & Uses |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Direct Goniolenses** | • Provide a direct view of the angle.<br>• Do not use mirrors.<br>• Usually require the patient to be supine (lying down). | • **[[Koeppe Lens]]**: Used for examination.<br>• **[[Barkan Goniolens]]**: Specifically used for **[[Goniotomy]]** surgery in congenital glaucoma.<br>• **Swan-Jacob Lens**: Used for surgical gonioscopy. |
| **Indirect Goniolenses** | • Provide a mirror image of the opposite angle.<br>• Used with a [[Slit Lamp]]. | • **[[Goldmann Goniolens]]**: Used for laser procedures like **[[Laser Trabeculoplasty]]**.<br>• **Zeiss/Posner (4-mirror)**: Used for dynamic gonioscopy and laser procedures. |

#### 2. Fundus Viewing Lenses
These are used to visualize the posterior segment ([[Retina]] and [[Vitreous]]) during examination, laser photocoagulation, or [[Vitrectomy]].

*   **Non-Contact Lenses:**
    *   Used with Slit Lamp Biomicroscopy.
    *   **Examples:** **+90D**, **+78D**, **+60D**.
    *   **Image:** Real, inverted, and magnified.
    *   **+60D Lens:** Provides higher magnification; useful for disc and macula evaluation.
    *   **+90D Lens:** Provides a wider field of view.

*   **Contact Lenses:**
    *   Placed directly on the cornea (requires anesthesia and coupling fluid).
    *   **[[Goldmann Three-Mirror Contact Lens]]**:
        *   **Central Part:** View of the posterior pole (30°).
        *   **Equatorial Mirror:** View of the equator and mid-periphery.
        *   **Peripheral Mirror:** View of the peripheral retina.
        *   **Gonioscopic Mirror:** View of the angle and ora serrata.
    *   **Panfundoscopic Lens:** Used for wide-field observation during laser treatment.
    *   **[[Hruby Lens]]**: A plano-concave lens (-58.6 D) attached to the slit lamp; provides a virtual, erect image.

### II. Intraocular Lenses (IOLs)

[[Intraocular Lenses]] are permanent optical devices implanted inside the eye to replace the natural crystalline [[Lens]] (usually after [[Cataract]] extraction) or to correct refractive errors (Phakic IOLs).

#### 1. Components of an IOL
*   **Optic:** The central refractive element.
*   **Haptic:** The peripheral arms (loops) that support and fixate the lens within the eye.

#### 2. Classification based on Location

| Location | Description | Indications |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Posterior Chamber IOL]] (PCIOL)** | • Implanted behind the iris.<br>• **In the Bag:** Placed inside the capsular bag (Most physiological and preferred site).<br>• **In the Sulcus:** Placed in the ciliary sulcus if the posterior capsule is compromised but support is adequate. | • Routine [[Phacoemulsification]] or ECCE.<br>• Most cataract surgeries. |
| **[[Anterior Chamber IOL]] (ACIOL)** | • Implanted in front of the iris.<br>• Supported by the angle structures (Angle-supported).<br>• Example: **Kelman Multiflex**. | • Complicated surgeries with loss of capsular support.<br>• [[Surgical Aphakia]]. |
| **Iris-Fixated IOL** | • Fixed to the iris tissue (e.g., Iris Claw Lens). | • Aphakia without capsular support. |
| **Scleral Fixated IOL (SFIOL)** | • Sutured or glued to the sclera. | • Absence of capsular support. |

**Clinical Implication:** **ACIOLs** are associated with a higher risk of **[[Bullous Keratopathy]]** (corneal decompensation) and **[[Glaucoma]]** compared to PCIOLs.

#### 3. Classification based on Material

*   **Rigid Lenses:**
    *   Material: **[[PMMA]]** (Polymethyl methacrylate).
    *   Requires a larger incision (approx. 5-6 mm) for insertion.
    *   Used in **[[ECCE]]** (Extracapsular Cataract Extraction).
*   **Foldable Lenses:**
    *   Materials: **[[Silicone]]**, **[[Hydrophobic Acrylic]]**, **[[Hydrophilic Acrylic]]**.
    *   Can be folded and injected through a small incision (2.2 – 3.2 mm) using an injector cartridge.
    *   Used in **[[Phacoemulsification]]**.
    *   **Square-edged design:** Reduces the incidence of **[[Posterior Capsular Opacification]] (PCO)**.

#### 4. Classification based on Optical Function

1.  **Monofocal IOLs:**
    *   Focus light for a single distance (usually far vision).
    *   Patient requires reading glasses for near vision.
2.  **[[Multifocal IOL]]s:**
    *   Have multiple rings/zones to focus light for distance, intermediate, and near vision.
    *   **Side Effects:** May cause glare and halos.
3.  **[[Toric IOL]]s:**
    *   Correct pre-existing corneal **[[Astigmatism]]**.
    *   Must be aligned along a specific axis during surgery.
4.  **Accommodative IOLs:**
    *   Designed to move forward/backward (optic shift) to simulate natural accommodation (e.g., Crystalens).
5.  **Aspheric IOLs:**
    *   Designed to reduce spherical aberrations and improve contrast sensitivity.

#### 5. Phakic Intraocular Lenses (Phakic IOLs)
*   **Definition:** Lenses implanted *without* removing the natural crystalline lens.
*   **Indication:** High **[[Myopia]]** (> -8D to -22D) or Hypermetropia where LASIK is contraindicated.
*   **Types:**
    *   **ICL ([[Implantable Collamer Lens]]):** Implanted in the posterior chamber (sulcus) behind the iris.
    *   **Iris-claw lenses** (Artisan/Verisyse).

### III. IOL Power Calculation (Biometry)

To determine the correct power of the IOL to be implanted, **[[Biometry]]** is performed pre-operatively.

*   **Formula:** **SRK Formula** (Sanders-Retzlaff-Kraff).
    *   $P = A - 2.5L - 0.9K$
    *   **P** = Power of IOL.
    *   **A** = A-constant (specific to the lens).
    *   **L** = [[Axial Length]] (measured by A-Scan Ultrasound or Optical Biometer).
    *   **K** = Keratometry (Corneal curvature).
*   **Modern Formulae:** SRK-T (for long eyes), Hoffer Q (for short eyes), Holladay, Haigis.
