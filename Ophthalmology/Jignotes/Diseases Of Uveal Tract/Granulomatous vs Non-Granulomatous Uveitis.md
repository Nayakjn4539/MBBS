# [[Diseases Of Uveal Tract]] > Granulomatous vs Non-Granulomatous Uveitis

Based on the comprehensive review of [[Diseases of Uveal Tract]], specifically the classification of [[Uveitis]], the differentiation between Granulomatous and Non-Granulomatous uveitis is clinically pivotal for determining etiology and management.

### **Classification Overview**

Pathologically, non-suppurative uveitis is classified into two main types based on the tissue reaction:
1.  **[[Granulomatous Uveitis]]**: A chronic, proliferative inflammation characterized by cellular infiltration (giant cells, epithelioid cells) and nodule formation.
2.  **[[Non-Granulomatous Uveitis]]**: An acute, exudative inflammation characterized by a vascular response (dilation, increased permeability) and fibrinous exudation.

### **Comparative Table: Granulomatous vs. Non-Granulomatous Uveitis**

| Feature | [[Granulomatous Uveitis]] | [[Non-Granulomatous Uveitis]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Onset** | Insidious (Gradual) | Acute (Sudden) |
| **Course** | Chronic, protracted | Short, acute duration (often recurrent) |
| **Pain & Photophobia** | Mild or minimal | Marked/Severe |
| **Ciliary Congestion** | Minimal | Marked (Circumcorneal congestion) |
| **[[Keratic Precipitates]] (KPs)** | **Mutton Fat KPs** (Large, greasy, yellow-white) | **Fine/Cellular KPs** (Small, discrete, dirty white) |
| **[[Aqueous Flare]]** | Mild | Marked (due to heavy protein leakage) |
| **[[Hypopyon]]** | Usually absent | May be present (e.g., [[Behcet's Disease]], [[HLA-B27 Uveitis]]) |
| **[[Iris Nodules]]** | **Usually Present** (Koeppe & Busacca) | Absent |
| **[[Posterior Synechiae]]** | Thick, broad-based, and vascularized | Thin, tenuous, and easily broken |
| **Iris Structure** | Often thickened, nodular | Oedematous, muddy, water-logged |
| **Pathology** | Giant cells, Epithelioid cells, Lymphocytes | Lymphocytes, Plasma cells, PMNs (in acute phase) |

### **Detailed Clinical Features**

#### **1. Keratic Precipitates (KPs)**
[[Keratic Precipitates]] are proteinaceous cellular deposits on the corneal endothelium, usually arranged in [[Arlt's Triangle]] (inferior quadrant).
*   **Mutton Fat KPs:** Pathognomonic of [[Granulomatous Uveitis]]. They are large, thick, fluffy, and have a greasy/waxy appearance. Composed of [[Macrophages]] and [[Epithelioid Cells]].
*   **Fine KPs:** Seen in [[Non-Granulomatous Uveitis]]. Composed of [[Lymphocytes]].
*   **Stellate KPs:** Fine, star-shaped KPs distributed diffusely. Seen in [[Fuchs' Heterochromic Iridocyclitis]] and Viral Uveitis.

#### **2. Iris Nodules**
These are aggregations of inflammatory cells, typical of [[Granulomatous Inflammation]].
*   **[[Koeppe Nodules]]:** Located at the **pupillary border** (Margin). Smaller and can be seen in both granulomatous and sometimes non-granulomatous types.
*   **[[Busacca Nodules]]:** Located on the **anterior surface** (stroma/collarette) of the iris. Larger and specific to granulomatous uveitis.

**Mnemonic for Nodules:**
*   **K**oeppe $\rightarrow$ **K**inare pe (Hindi for "at the edge/margin") or **P**upillary margin.
*   **B**usacca $\rightarrow$ **B**ase (Surface) of Iris.

#### **3. Pathological Differences**
*   **Granulomatous:** Represents a Type IV Hypersensitivity reaction. It involves the proliferation of large mononuclear cells which become epithelioid and giant cells, aggregating into nodules.
*   **Non-Granulomatous:** Represents a physical/toxic insult or Type III Hypersensitivity (Immune complex). Characterized by breakdown of the [[Blood-Aqueous Barrier]], pouring of fibrin, and lymphocyte infiltration.

### **Etiology (Causes)**

#### **Granulomatous Uveitis Causes**
Usually associated with direct organismal invasion or specific systemic diseases.
*   **Infectious:**
    *   [[Tuberculosis]]
    *   [[Syphilis]]
    *   [[Leprosy]]
    *   [[Brucellosis]]
    *   [[Toxoplasmosis]]
    *   [[Herpes Viruses]] (HSV, VZV - can be granulomatous or non-granulomatous)
*   **Non-Infectious:**
    *   [[Sarcoidosis]]
    *   [[Sympathetic Ophthalmitis]]
    *   [[Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Syndrome]] (VKH)
    *   Lens-induced Uveitis ([[Phacoanaphylactic Endophthalmitis]])

**Mnemonic for Granulomatous Causes: "STLS"**
*   **S**yphilis / **S**arcoidosis / **S**ympathetic Ophthalmitis
*   **T**uberculosis / **T**oxoplasmosis
*   **L**eprosy / **L**ens-induced
*   **V**KH

#### **Non-Granulomatous Uveitis Causes**
Usually allergic or immune-complex mediated.
*   **Idiopathic** (Most common)
*   **HLA-B27 Associated:**
    *   [[Ankylosing Spondylitis]]
    *   [[Reiter's Syndrome]]
*   [[Behcet's Disease]]
*   [[Fuchs' Heterochromic Iridocyclitis]]
*   [[Posner-Schlossman Syndrome]] (Glaucomatocyclitic Crisis)
*   Trauma
*   [[Psoriatic Arthritis]]
*   [[Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis]] (Chronic anterior uveitis).

### **Clinical Implications**

1.  **Diagnostic Approach:**
    *   **Granulomatous:** Requires a tailored systemic workup (e.g., Chest X-ray, Mantoux for TB; VDRL/TPHA for Syphilis; Serum ACE for Sarcoidosis) because it is frequently associated with specific systemic pathogens.
    *   **Non-Granulomatous:** Often idiopathic. Workup focuses on HLA-B27 typing and ruling out autoimmune joint diseases if recurrent.

2.  **Management:**
    *   **Non-Granulomatous:** Generally responds well to topical [[Corticosteroids]] and [[Cycloplegics]].
    *   **Granulomatous:** Often requires specific antimicrobial therapy (e.g., ATT for TB, Penicillin for Syphilis) in addition to steroids. Chronic cases are prone to complications like [[Complicated Cataract]] and [[Phthisis Bulbi]].
