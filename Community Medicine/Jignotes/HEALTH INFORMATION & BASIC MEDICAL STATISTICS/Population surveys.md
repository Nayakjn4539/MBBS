# [[HEALTH INFORMATION & BASIC MEDICAL STATISTICS]] > Population surveys

### Population Surveys

Routine health statistics (like hospital records) often represent only the "tip of the iceberg" because they only account for people seeking medical care. [[Population surveys]] are essential tools to supplement these routine statistics to provide a true picture of health and disease in the community.

### 1. Objectives of Health Surveys
Broadly, health surveys are conducted for three main purposes:
1.  **Evaluation of Health Status ([[Community Diagnosis]]):** To define the magnitude of health problems, morbidity, mortality, and nutritional status.
2.  **Investigation of Factors:** To study the [[Natural History of Disease]] and causative factors (e.g., occupation, environment, income).
3.  **Administration of Health Services:** To evaluate the utilization of health services, unmet needs, and expenditure on health.

### 2. Types of Surveys based on Data Collection Methods

| Method | Description | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Health Interview (Face-to-face)** | Measuring subjective phenomena (pain, disability, beliefs) via questions. | **Population-based**; measures perceived morbidity. | **Recall bias**; subjective errors. |
| **Health Examination** | Physical and laboratory investigations by a medical team. | More **valid** and precise information. | **Expensive**; difficult to do on a large scale; ethical issues of treating detected cases. |
| **Health Records Survey** | Collecting data from existing health service records. | **Cheapest** method. | Not population-based; reliability of data is questionable; lack of uniformity. |
| **Mailed Questionnaire** | Forms sent by post/email to respondents. | Simple and low cost. | High **non-response rate**; requires literate respondents. |

### 3. Study Designs in Surveys
*   **Cross-sectional Surveys:** Provide data on [[prevalence]] at a single point in time (Snapshot).
*   **Longitudinal Surveys:** Repeat observations on the same population over a period. Good for studying **natural history** and **incidence**.

### 4. Sampling in Surveys
Since it is often impossible to survey the entire population (except in a [[Census]]), sampling is used.
*   **Sampling Unit:** The most common unit is the **Household**.
*   **Sample Size:** Typically covers 5,000 to 10,000 households for national estimates.
*   **Generalizability:** The sample must be representative so results can be applied to the whole population.

### 5. Major Population Surveys in India
1.  **[[National Family Health Survey (NFHS)]]:** Conducted by IIPS (International Institute for Population Sciences). Provides data on fertility, infant mortality, family planning, and maternal/child health. (Latest: NFHS-5).
2.  **[[District Level Household Survey (DLHS)]]:** Focuses on reproductive and child health indicators at the district level.
3.  **[[Sample Registration System (SRS)]]:** A dual-record system (continuous enumeration + half-yearly survey) to provide reliable estimates of Birth Rate, Death Rate, and IMR.
4.  **National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO):** Conducts large-scale surveys on morbidity, employment, and consumption.

### Mnemonics
**To remember Methods of Data Collection in Surveys:**
**"HIRE"** the best surveyor.
*   **H** - **H**ealth Interview
*   **I** - **I**nterview (Mailed Questionnaire)
*   **R** - **R**ecords Survey
*   **E** - **E**xamination Survey

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Iceberg Phenomenon:** Hospital data only shows the "tip". Population surveys reveal the submerged portion (undiagnosed, asymptomatic, or mild cases).
*   **Policy Making:** Data from surveys like NFHS determine government funding and focus areas (e.g., if a survey shows high anemia rates, the government launches *Anemia Mukt Bharat*).
