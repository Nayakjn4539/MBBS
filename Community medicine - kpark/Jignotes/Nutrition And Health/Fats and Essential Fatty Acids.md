# [[Nutrition And Health]] > Fats and Essential Fatty Acids

### Fats and Essential Fatty Acids

### 1. Classification of Fats
Fats are classified based on chemical composition and nutritional value.

**A. Chemical Classification:**
1.  **Simple Lipids:** Esters of fatty acids with glycerol (e.g., **[[Triglycerides]]**). 99% of body fat is in this form.
2.  **Compound Lipids:** Esters of fatty acids with alcohol and other groups (e.g., **[[Phospholipids]]**, Glycolipids).
3.  **Derived Lipids:** Derived from hydrolysis of simple and compound lipids (e.g., **[[Cholesterol]]**, Fatty acids).

**B. Nutritional Classification (Based on Fatty Acids):**
*   **Saturated Fatty Acids (SFA):**
    *   Usually solid at room temperature.
    *   Sources: Animal fats, Coconut oil, Palm oil.
    *   *Clinical Relevance:* Increases plasma cholesterol.
*   **Unsaturated Fatty Acids:**
    *   **Monounsaturated (MUFA):** e.g., Oleic acid.
    *   **Polyunsaturated (PUFA):** e.g., Linoleic acid, Alpha-linolenic acid.
    *   Sources: Vegetable oils, Fish oils.

### 2. Essential Fatty Acids (EFA)
**Definition:** Fatty acids that **cannot** be synthesized by the human body and must be derived from food.

**Types of EFAs:**
1.  **Linoleic Acid (n-6 or Omega-6):**
    *   The *most* important EFA.
    *   Serves as a basis for the production of other EFAs like Arachidonic acid.
    *   **Sources:** Safflower oil (Richest), Corn oil, Sunflower oil, Soybean oil.
2.  **Alpha-Linolenic Acid (n-3 or Omega-3):**
    *   Precursor for Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).
    *   **Sources:** Soybean oil, Mustard oil, Leafy greens, Fish oil, Flaxseed.
3.  **Arachidonic Acid:**
    *   Can be synthesized from Linoleic acid in the body (hence considered semi-essential by some).
    *   **Sources:** Meat, Eggs, Milk fat.

> **Mnemonic for EFAs:** **LAL**
> *   **L** - Linoleic Acid (Omega 6)
> *   **A** - Arachidonic Acid
> *   **L** - Linolenic Acid (Omega 3)

**Functions of EFAs:**
*   Structural integrity of cell membranes.
*   Precursors of **[[Prostaglandins]]** (local hormones).
*   Lower serum cholesterol and LDL levels.
*   Decreased platelet adhesiveness.

### 3. Sources of Dietary Fat
Dietary fats are categorized into two types based on visibility:

| Type | Description | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Visible Fats** | Fats separated from their natural source. Easy to estimate intake. | Ghee, Butter, Cooking oils, Vanaspati. |
| **Invisible Fats** | Fats present integrally in foods; not visible to the naked eye. Difficult to estimate. | Cereals (Rice, Wheat), Pulses, Milk, Eggs, Nuts, Meat. |

*Note: In India, cereals and pulses contribute significantly to invisible fat intake.*

### 4. Functions of Fats
1.  **Energy Source:** High energy density providing **9 kcal/g**.
2.  **Vitamin Absorption:** Vehicle for fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K).
3.  **Satiety:** Delays gastric emptying, providing a feeling of fullness.
4.  **Insulation & Support:** Subcutaneous fat insulates against cold; supports viscera (heart, kidney).
5.  **Palatability:** Improves taste and texture of food.

### 5. Hydrogenation and Trans-Fatty Acids
*   **Hydrogenation:** Process of converting liquid vegetable oils into semi-solid fats (e.g., **[[Vanaspati]]** or vegetable ghee) using high temperature and pressure.
    *   *Advantage:* Improved keeping quality and consistency.
    *   *Disadvantage:* Reduces EFA content and creates Trans-fatty acids.
*   **Trans-Fatty Acids (TFA):**
    *   Formed during partial hydrogenation.
    *   **Harmful Effects:** Increase LDL (Bad cholesterol), Decrease HDL (Good cholesterol), Increase risk of **[[Coronary Heart Disease]]** (CHD).
    *   **Sources:** Fried fast foods, bakery products, vanaspati.
    *   **Goal:** Intake should be **<1%** of total energy.

### 6. Health Disorders Related to Fats

#### A. Deficiency: Phrynoderma (Toad Skin)
*   **Cause:** Deficiency of Essential Fatty Acids (EFA).
*   **Clinical Picture:** Horny papular eruptions on the posterior and lateral aspects of limbs, back, and buttocks. Rough and dry skin.
*   **Treatment:** Administration of Linseed or Safflower oil (rich in EFA) along with B-complex vitamins.

#### B. Excess: Obesity and CHD
*   **Obesity:** High fat intake leads to positive energy balance.
*   **Coronary Heart Disease (CHD):**
    *   High intake of Saturated Fats and Cholesterol is a major risk factor.
    *   High **[[LDL Cholesterol]]** is atherogenic; **[[HDL Cholesterol]]** is protective.
    *   **Cancer:** High fat intake is associated with colon and breast cancer.

### 7. Dietary Goals and Recommendations (WHO/ICMR)
To prevent chronic diseases, the following goals are recommended:

*   **Total Fat Intake:** 15–30% of total energy.
*   **Saturated Fatty Acids:** <10% of total energy.
*   **Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA):** 6–10% of total energy.
*   **Trans-Fatty Acids:** <1% of total energy.
*   **Dietary Cholesterol:** <300 mg/day.
*   **Choice of Cooking Oil:** Use a blend of oils (e.g., Groundnut + Mustard) to ensure a balance of fatty acids. Limit ghee/butter.
