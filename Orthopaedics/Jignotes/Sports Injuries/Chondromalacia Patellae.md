# Chondromalacia Patellae

### Definition
[[Chondromalacia patellae]] is a pathological condition characterized by the softening, fibrillation, and erosion of the [[articular cartilage]] of the [[patella]] (kneecap). It is a common cause of [[anterior knee pain]] in adolescents and young adults.

### Etiology and Risk Factors
The condition is often multifactorial, arising from trauma, overuse, or anatomical abnormalities.

1.  **Trauma:**
    *   **Acute:** Direct blow to the patella (dashboard injury).
    *   **Chronic:** Repetitive microtrauma due to friction between the patella and the [[femoral condyle]].
2.  **Patellar Instability:** Recurrent [[subluxation]] or [[dislocation of the patella]].
3.  **Malalignment:** Abnormal tracking of the patella within the [[trochlear groove]].
    *   **"Malicious Malalignment Syndrome":** A combination of factors leading to severe tracking issues.
        *   Excessive [[femoral anteversion]].
        *   External [[tibial torsion]].
        *   [[Genu valgum]] (Knock knees).
        *   Increased [[Q-angle]].
4.  **Muscle Imbalance:** Weakness of the [[vastus medialis obliquus]] (VMO) relative to the [[vastus lateralis]].

### Pathophysiology and Staging
The degeneration typically begins on the medial facet of the patella. The progression is described in four stages:

*   **Stage I:** Swelling and softening of the cartilage.
*   **Stage II:** Fissuring and fragmentation of the cartilage.
*   **Stage III:** Deformation and further fragmentation (crab-meat appearance).
*   **Stage IV:** Erosion exposing the subchondral bone (leading to [[osteoarthritis]]).

### Clinical Features
**Symptoms**
*   **Pain:** Deep, aching pain behind the kneecap (retropatellar pain).
*   **Aggravating Factors:**
    *   Climbing or descending stairs (descending is often worse due to higher eccentric load).
    *   Squatting or kneeling.
*   **[[Cinema sign]] / [[Movie sign]]:** Pain and stiffness after sitting with knees flexed for a prolonged period (e.g., watching a movie or long travel).
*   **Giving way:** A sensation of the knee buckling, usually due to reflex inhibition of the [[quadriceps]] caused by pain.
*   **Pseudolocking:** A catching sensation, distinct from true locking seen in [[meniscal tears]].

**Signs**
*   **Tenderness:** Usually localized to the medial articular facet of the patella when the patella is pushed laterally.
*   **Crepitus:** Palpable grating sensation during knee flexion and extension.
*   **[[Patellar grinding test]]:** Positive. Compressing the patella against the femur while the patient contracts the quadriceps elicits pain.
*   **Q-Angle:** May be increased (Normal is <15° in males, <20° in females).

### Investigations
1.  **X-rays:**
    *   **AP and Lateral views:** To rule out other pathologies.
    *   **Skyline view (Axial view):** Best for visualizing the [[patellofemoral joint]] space, patellar tilt, or subluxation.
2.  **[[CT scan]]:** Useful for assessing malalignment and patellar tracking.
3.  **[[MRI]]:** Non-invasive method to visualize cartilage changes (edema, thinning).
4.  **[[Arthroscopy]]:** The **gold standard** for diagnosis. It allows direct visualization of cartilage softening and fibrillation.

### Differential Diagnosis
*   [[Meniscal tear]] (True locking vs. Pseudolocking).
*   [[Prepatellar bursitis]] (Housemaid's knee).
*   [[Patellar tendinitis]] (Jumper's knee).
*   [[Plica syndrome]].
*   Referred pain from the [[hip joint]].

### Management

**Conservative Treatment (First Line)**
Most cases respond well to non-operative management.
1.  **Activity Modification:** Avoidance of inciting activities like deep squats, kneeling, or climbing stairs.
2.  **Pharmacotherapy:** [[NSAIDs]] for pain relief and reduction of inflammation.
3.  **Physiotherapy:**
    *   **Quadriceps Strengthening:** Focus specifically on the **[[vastus medialis obliquus]] (VMO)** to counteract lateral tracking.
    *   Isometric exercises are preferred initially.
4.  **Orthotics:** Knee braces with a patellar cutout to centralize tracking or taping (McConnell taping).

**Surgical Treatment**
Indicated only if conservative management fails after 6 months.
1.  **[[Arthroscopic chondroplasty]]:** Shaving or debridement of the fibrillated cartilage to smooth the surface.
2.  **[[Lateral retinacular release]]:** Cutting the tight lateral retinaculum to allow the patella to track more medially.
3.  **Realignment Procedures:**
    *   **Proximal realignment:** Medial reefing.
    *   **Distal realignment:** Tibial tubercle transfer (e.g., Maquet procedure, Elmslie-Trillat) to correct the Q-angle.
4.  **[[Patellectomy]]:** Removal of the patella. This is a salvage procedure and rarely done today as it significantly weakens the extensor mechanism.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Diagnostic Pitfall:** Do not confuse the "catching" sensation of chondromalacia with the "true locking" of a bucket-handle meniscal tear. True locking restricts full extension mechanically.
*   **Rehabilitation:** Strengthening the **VMO** is crucial. The VMO is the primary dynamic stabilizer against lateral subluxation. If the vastus lateralis is strong but the VMO is weak, the patella will be pulled laterally, worsening the condition.
