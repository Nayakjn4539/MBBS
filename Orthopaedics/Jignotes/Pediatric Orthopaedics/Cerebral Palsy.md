# Cerebral Palsy (Orthopaedic Management)

### Definition
[[Cerebral Palsy]] (CP) is defined as a group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and posture, causing activity limitation, that are attributed to a **non-progressive disturbance** that occurred in the developing fetal or infant brain. 

**Key Characteristics:**
*   **Non-progressive:** The brain lesion is static, though the musculoskeletal manifestations (deformities) may progress with growth.
*   **Immature Brain:** Injury occurs during the prenatal, natal, or early postnatal period.
*   **Motor Impairment:** The hallmark is a disorder of tone, posture, and movement.

### Etiology and Risk Factors
The causes vary depending on the timing of the insult to the brain.

| Time of Insult | Causes |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Prenatal** | • [[Rubella]] infection<br>• Fetal [[anoxia]]<br>• Maternal diabetes<br>• Genetic causes |
| **Natal** | • **Birth trauma** (common)<br>• [[Anoxia]] / Hypoxia<br>• Prematurity (strong association with spastic diplegia) |
| **Postnatal** (0–7 days) | • Trauma<br>• [[Encephalitis]]<br>• [[Meningitis]]<br>• Kernicterus |

### Classification
CP is classified based on the clinical type (physiological), the topography of limb involvement, and severity.

#### 1. Physiological Classification (Based on Motor Disorder)
The lesion location in the brain correlates with the clinical type:

*   **Spastic (65% - Most Common):** Due to lesion in the [[Cerebral Cortex]] / Pyramidal tract. Characterized by increased tone (clasp-knife type), hyperreflexia, and clonus.
*   **Dyskinetic / Athetoid (25%):** Due to lesion in the [[Basal Ganglia]] / Midbrain. Characterized by involuntary, uncontrolled, slow, writhing movements.
*   **Ataxic:** Due to lesion in the [[Cerebellum]]. Characterized by loss of balance and coordination.
*   **Mixed:** Widespread brain involvement (e.g., Spastic + Athetoid).
*   **Hypotonic:** Usually a transient stage in infants ("floppy infant") before evolving into spastic or athetoid types.

#### 2. Topographical Classification (Based on Limb Involvement)
*   **Monoplegia:** One limb involved (rare).
*   **Hemiplegia:** One side of the body involved (Upper limb usually > Lower limb).
*   **Paraplegia:** Both lower limbs involved (rare in CP, common in spinal cord injury).
*   **Diplegia:** All four limbs involved, but **Lower limbs > Upper limbs**. (Common in premature infants).
*   **Quadriplegia (Tetraplegia):** All four limbs involved equally or Upper limbs > Lower limbs.
*   **Triplegia:** Three limbs involved (usually both legs and one arm).

#### 3. Classification based on Severity (Minear’s)
*   **Mild (25%):** Independent in daily activities and ambulation.
*   **Moderate (50%):** Needs help in daily activities and ambulation; may use assistive devices.
*   **Severe (25%):** Bedridden, wheelchair-bound, total dependence.

### Clinical Assessment
The orthopaedic surgeon must evaluate the child to plan management effectively.

#### History
*   **Birth History:** Prematurity, prolonged labor, delayed cry, NICU stay.
*   **Milestones:** **Delayed motor milestones** (e.g., neck holding, sitting, walking) is the most consistent feature.

#### Physical Examination
*   **Muscle Tone:** Increased in spastic CP.
*   **Reflexes:** 
    *   Deep tendon reflexes are exaggerated.
    *   **Primitive reflexes** (e.g., Moro, ATNR) persist beyond the normal age of disappearance.
*   **Deformities:** Check for dynamic (correctable) vs. static (fixed) contractures.
*   **Gait Analysis:** Observe for scissoring (adductor spasm), crouch gait (hamstring/flexor tightness), or equinus (calf tightness).

**Clinical Implications:**
Children with **Athetoid/Dyskinetic CP** are generally more intelligent than those with **Spastic CP**. Hemiplegics usually walk by 12–16 months, while quadriplegics rarely walk.

### Orthopaedic Problems and Deformities
Muscles are spastic and do not grow as fast as the bone, leading to contractures and eventual bony deformities.

| Region | Common Deformity/Problem | Pathomechanics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Spine** | [[Scoliosis]] / Kyphosis | Muscle imbalance and weakness. |
| **Hip** | Adduction, Flexion, Internal Rotation | Spasticity of Adductors and Iliopsoas. "Scissoring gait." Risk of subluxation/dislocation. |
| **Knee** | Flexion contracture | Spasticity of Hamstrings and Gracilis. "Crouch gait." |
| **Ankle/Foot** | [[Equinus deformity]] (Walk on toes) | Spasticity of Gastrocnemius-Soleus complex. |
| **Upper Limb** | Pronation of forearm, Flexion of wrist/fingers, Thumb-in-palm | Muscle imbalance (Pronators > Supinators; Flexors > Extensors). |

### Management Principles
There is no permanent "cure" for CP. The goal is to maximize function and minimize defects. Management requires a **multidisciplinary team** (Orthopaedist, Pediatrician, Physiotherapist, Neurologist).

**Goals of Treatment:**
1.  **Communication:** Speech therapy/aids.
2.  **Education:** Special schooling if needed.
3.  **Mobility:** Wheelchair, walkers, independent walking.
4.  **Ambulation:** Improve gait efficiency.

#### 1. Non-Operative Management
*   **Physiotherapy:** Crucial for preventing contractures, strengthening muscles, and gait training.
*   **Orthoses (Bracing):**
    *   **AFO (Ankle-Foot Orthosis):** To prevent foot drop and equinus.
    *   **Splints:** Cock-up splints for wrist, abduction pillows for hips.
*   **Medications:** Oral muscle relaxants (e.g., Baclofen, Diazepam) to reduce spasticity.
*   **Chemodenervation ([[Botulinum Toxin]] A):**
    *   Injected into spastic muscles (e.g., Gastrocnemius, Adductors) to block acetylcholine release.
    *   Reduces tone temporarily (3–6 months) to allow better physiotherapy and delay surgery.
    *   Useful in dynamic contractures.

#### 2. Operative Management
Surgery is indicated mainly for **spastic** types to correct fixed deformities or improve hygiene in non-ambulators. It is rarely useful for athetoid or ataxic types.

**A. Soft Tissue Procedures (Releases and Lengthening)**
Performed to correct contractures.
*   **Hip:** 
    *   **Adductor Tenotomy:** For scissoring gait and to prevent hip subluxation.
    *   **Obturator Neurectomy:** Cutting the anterior branch of the obturator nerve to reduce adductor spasticity.
    *   **Iliopsoas Release:** For hip flexion contracture.
*   **Knee:** 
    *   **Hamstring Release/Lengthening:** For knee flexion deformity (Crouch gait).
    *   **Rectus Femoris Transfer:** For stiff knee gait (failure of knee flexion during swing phase).
*   **Ankle:** 
    *   **Tendo-Achilles Lengthening (TAL):** For equinus deformity. (Often done via Hoke’s or White’s percutaneous technique).
*   **Upper Limb:** 
    *   Release of Pronator Teres (for pronation deformity).
    *   Release of wrist flexors (FCU) or transfer to extensors.

**B. Bony Procedures (Osteotomies and Arthrodesis)**
Performed for bony torsion or joint instability.
*   **Femoral Derotation Osteotomy:** To correct excessive femoral anteversion (internal rotation gait).
*   **Varus Derotation Osteotomy (VDRO):** To contain the hip in hip dysplasia.
*   **Triple Arthrodesis:** For severe, rigid foot deformities (e.g., valgus/varus foot) in older children.
*   **Spine Fusion:** For progressive scoliosis affecting sitting balance.

**C. [[SEMLS]] (Single Event Multi-Level Surgery)**
*   Performing all necessary soft tissue and bony corrections at one operative setting (e.g., hips, knees, and ankles simultaneously) to reduce the number of hospitalizations and total rehabilitation time.

**D. Neurosurgical Procedures**
*   **Selective Dorsal [[Rhizotomy]] (SDR):**
    *   Selective severing of dorsal (sensory) rootlets of the cauda equina (L1-S1).
    *   **Indication:** Spastic diplegic child (3–8 years), ambulatory, with good intelligence.
    *   **Mechanism:** Interupts the reflex arc to decrease spasticity without impairing sensation or voluntary power.
*   **Intrathecal Baclofen Pump:** For severe generalized spasticity.

### Prognosis
*   **Hemiplegics:** Almost all will walk.
*   **Diplegics:** Most will walk (often with aids).
*   **Quadriplegics:** Rarely walk; treatment focuses on "propped sitting" for feeding and hygiene.
*   **Sitting:** If a child can sit by age 2, they will likely walk. If not sitting by age 4, walking is unlikely.
