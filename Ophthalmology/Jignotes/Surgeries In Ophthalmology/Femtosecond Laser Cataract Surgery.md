# Femtosecond Laser Assisted Cataract Surgery (FLACS)

**Femtosecond Laser Assisted Cataract Surgery ([[FLACS]])** represents a significant advancement in [[Microincision Cataract Surgery]] ([[MICS]]). It utilizes a femtosecond laser to perform critical steps of the procedure with high precision, reproducibility, and safety, followed by standard phacoemulsification for completion.

### Principles and Technology
*   **Mechanism**: **Photodisruption**. The laser generates ultrafast pulses (as short as $10^{-15}$ seconds, i.e., one-quadrillionth of a second) to create plasma-mediated ablation. This divides material at the molecular level without transferring heat or impact to surrounding tissues.
*   **Wavelength**: **1053 nm** (Near Infrared).
*   **Pulse Duration**: Ultrafast pulses ($10^{-15}$ seconds).
*   **Interaction**: Creates **microcavitation bubbles** (plasma of free electrons and ionized molecules) that expand and collapse, producing an acoustic shock wave to separate tissue.

### Steps Performed by Femtosecond Laser
The [[Femtosecond Laser]] is used to automate the following steps before the patient is shifted to the operating microscope for manual completion:
1.  **Corneal Incisions**: Creation of primary and secondary clear corneal incisions (CCIs). These are self-sealing, stable, and precise.
2.  **Anterior Capsulotomy**: Creates a perfectly centered, circular, and sized capsulotomy (superior to manual [[Continuous Curvilinear Capsulorhexis]] or [[CCC]]). This is crucial for premium [[Intraocular Lenses]] ([[IOLs]]) like multifocal or toric lenses.
3.  **Lens Fragmentation**: The laser softens and fragments the nucleus (e.g., grid pattern, quadrants), significantly reducing the amount of [[Phacoemulsification]] energy required.
4.  **Astigmatic Keratotomy**: Creation of arcuate incisions to correct pre-existing corneal [[Astigmatism]].

### Instrumentation for FLACS Completion
While the laser performs the initial incisions and fragmentation, a standard **Phacoemulsification Set** is required to complete the surgery (opening incisions, removing the capsule, aspirating lens matter, and implanting the IOL).

#### 1. Eye Speculums
Used to retract the eyelids and keep them apart during surgery.
*   **[[Universal Metallic Eye Speculum]]**:
    *   Can be used for both right and left eyes.
    *   Has two limbs and a spring mechanism with a screw to adjust the width.
    *   Blades are open.
*   **Eye Speculum with Guard (Solid Blades)**:
    *   Similar to universal but with solid blades to keep eyelashes away from the surgical field.
*   **[[Wire Speculum]]** (Barraquer type):
    *   Very light wire frame.
    *   Causes minimal pressure on the [[Eyeball]].
    *   Commonly used in phacoemulsification and FLACS due to its lightweight nature.

#### 2. Fixation Forceps
Used to stabilize the globe or hold tissues.
*   **[[Globe Fixation Forceps]]**:
    *   Has 2x3 or 3x4 teeth at the tip.
    *   Applied near the limbus to hold conjunctiva and episcleral tissue to fixate the eye during manipulation.
*   **[[Corneo-scleral Forceps]]**:
    *   **[[Colibri Forceps]]** or **[[Lim's Forceps]]**.
    *   Have very fine 1x2 teeth.
    *   Used to hold the corneal or scleral edge of the incision for suturing (if needed) or stabilization.
*   **[[Superior Rectus Holding Forceps]]**:
    *   Toothed forceps (1x2) with an S-shaped double curve.
    *   Historically used to pass a bridle suture under the superior rectus muscle; less common now with topical anesthesia used in FLACS/Phaco.

#### 3. Standard Phacoemulsification Instruments (For Completion)
After laser treatment, the patient is moved to the microscope, and the following instruments are used:
*   **Fine Iris Repositor / Spatula**: To open the corneal incisions created by the laser.
*   **[[Capsulorhexis Forceps]]**: Used to grasp and remove the free-floating anterior capsular flap created by the laser.
*   **[[Hydrodissection Cannula]]**: A 25G or 27G cannula with a bent tip used to inject fluid to separate the cortex from the capsule ([[Hydrodissection]]).
*   **[[Phacoemulsification Probe]]**: Titanium needle tip vibrating at ultrasonic speed (40,000 Hz) to aspirate the laser-fragmented nucleus.
*   **[[Chopper]] / [[Sinskey Hook]]**: Used to manipulate nuclear fragments and feed them into the phaco probe.
*   **Irrigation-Aspiration (I/A) Cannula**: Two-way cannula to aspirate residual cortical matter.
*   **[[IOL Injector]]**: Used to inject foldable [[Intraocular Lenses]] through the small incision.

### Advantages of FLACS
*   **Precision**: Capsulotomy size and centration are highly accurate.
*   **Safety**: Reduced phaco energy decreases the risk of corneal endothelial damage (corneal edema) and zonular stress.
*   **Stability**: Laser-created corneal incisions are more stable and reproducible, reducing surgically induced astigmatism.
*   **Predictability**: Better effective lens position (ELP) due to precise capsulotomy.
