# Sources of Health Information

Health information is essential for health planning, management, and evaluation of health services. The two most critical sources of demographic and health-related data in India are the **Census** and the **Sample Registration System (SRS)**.

---

## 1. Census

The [[Census]] is the "total process of collecting, compiling, and publishing demographic, economic, and social data pertaining at a specified time to all persons in a country or delimited territory." It is the **primary source** of health information.

### Key Characteristics
*   **Frequency:** Conducted every **10 years** (Decadal).
*   **Authority:** Conducted by the **Registrar General and Census Commissioner**, under the [[Ministry of Home Affairs]].
*   **Legal Basis:** The **Census Act, 1948**.
*   **First Census:** 1881 (First synchronous census); The last completed census was 2011.
*   **Census Moment/Stop:** The snapshot of the population is taken at **00:00 hours on 1st March** of the census year.

### Methodology
1.  **De Facto (Date System):** Counting people where they are found on the census night (Used in India till 1931).
2.  **De Jure (Period System):** Counting people at their place of **normal residence** (Used in India since 1941).

### Information Collected
*   **Demographic:** Age, sex, marital status.
*   **Social:** Literacy, education, language, religion, caste (SC/ST).
*   **Economic:** Occupation, employment status.
*   **Health-related:** Disability, fertility (number of children born), mortality.
*   **Housing:** Drinking water source, latrine type, fuel used.

### New Features (Census 2011)
*   Collection of **Biometrics** (Fingerprints and Iris scan).
*   Creation of the **National Population Register (NPR)**.
*   [[Unique Identification Number (UID)]] issuance.

### Uses
*   Provides the **denominator** for calculating health rates (e.g., Birth Rate, Death Rate).
*   Essential for socio-economic planning and delimitation of constituencies.
*   Assessing population growth and trends (e.g., Sex Ratio, Literacy Rate).

### Limitations
*   **Time Consumption:** Full results take years to publish.
*   **Frequency:** Conducted only once in 10 years; cannot track short-term changes.
*   **Missing Data:** Floating populations (homeless) may be missed.

> **Clinical Relevance:** Census data helps public health experts calculate the **Community Diagnosis** and assess the "At-Risk" population for disease outbreaks.

## 2. Sample Registration System (SRS)

Since the [[Civil Registration System (CRS)]] (birth and death registration) in India is incomplete (deficient), the **SRS** was initiated to provide reliable annual estimates of vital statistics.

### Key Characteristics
*   **Initiated:** Pilot in 1964-65; Full scale from **1969-70**.
*   **Scope:** Covers both rural and urban areas.
*   **Significance:** It is currently the **most reliable source** for fertility and mortality indicators at the State and National levels.

### Methodology: The Dual Record System
The SRS minimizes errors by using two independent methods of data collection that cross-check each other.

1.  **Continuous Enumeration:** A part-time local enumerator (often a teacher/Anganwadi worker) records births and deaths as they occur throughout the year.
2.  **Independent Survey:** A full-time supervisor conducts a retrospective survey every **6 months**.
3.  **Matching:** Data from the enumerator and the supervisor are matched.
4.  **Verification:** Partially matched or unmatched events are re-verified in the field to get a correct unduplicated count.

### Key Indicators Generated by SRS
*   [[Crude Birth Rate (CBR)]]
*   [[Crude Death Rate (CDR)]]
*   [[Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)]]
*   [[Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)]]
*   Total Fertility Rate (TFR)
*   Under-5 Mortality Rate (U5MR)

> **Note:** Since 2004, SRS has included **Verbal Autopsy** to determine the *cause of death*.

### Mnemonic for SRS Methodology
**"C-I-M-V"**
*   **C** - **C**ontinuous Enumeration (Local enumerator)
*   **I** - **I**ndependent Survey (Every 6 months)
*   **M** - **M**atching of records
*   **V** - **V**erification of discrepancies

## Comparison: Census vs. SRS vs. CRS

| Feature | Census | Sample Registration System (SRS) | Civil Registration System (CRS) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frequency** | Once in 10 Years | Continuous + 6 monthly survey | Continuous (Legal mandate) |
| **Coverage** | Total Population | Representative Sample | Total Population (aimed) |
| **Accuracy** | High coverage, low depth | High accuracy (Dual record) | Variable (Under-reporting common) |
| **Main Output**| Population size, Demographics | **Vital Rates** (IMR, MMR, CBR, CDR) | Legal documents (Birth/Death Certificates) |
| **Authority** | Registrar General of India (MHA) | Registrar General of India | State Govt / Local Registrar |
