# [[Asphyxiant Poisons]] > Carbon Monoxide

### Carbon Monoxide (CO)

**Synonyms:** Carbonic oxide, Exhaust gas, Flue gas, Sweet gas.

### General Properties
*   **Physical:** Colorless, odorless, tasteless, and non-irritating gas.
*   **Density:** Slightly lighter than air (Specific gravity 0.97).
*   **Combustibility:** Flammable; burns with a pale blue flame.
*   It is a **Chemical Asphyxiant** (Systemic asphyxiant).

### Sources
1.  **Incomplete Combustion:** Burning of charcoal, wood, coal, or kerosene in ill-ventilated rooms (common in winter).
2.  **Exhaust Fumes:** Internal combustion engines (cars) release 1–7% CO.
3.  **Industrial:** Blast furnaces, coal mines (known as **"Afterdamp"** following explosions), lime kilns.
4.  **Domestic:** Defective gas heaters, "Sigris" or "Kangris" (coal braziers used in Kashmir).
5.  **Smoke:** Tobacco smoke (cigarette smoke contains ~4% CO), building fires.
6.  **Paint Removers:** Metabolism of [[Methylene Chloride]] produces CO in vivo.

### Mechanism of Action
Carbon monoxide causes tissue hypoxia through three primary mechanisms:

1.  **Haldane Effect (Anemic Hypoxia):**
    *   CO has **200–250 times** greater affinity for Hemoglobin (Hb) than Oxygen.
    *   It displaces Oxygen to form stable **[[Carboxyhaemoglobin]] (COHb)**.
    *   This reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.
2.  **Shift of Oxygen-Dissociation Curve:**
    *   Presence of COHb shifts the curve to the **Left**.
    *   This prevents the release of remaining oxygen to the tissues (impaired unloading).
3.  **Histotoxic Hypoxia:**
    *   CO binds to **[[Cytochrome Oxidase]]** (cellular respiratory enzyme), inhibiting electron transport and ATP production.
    *   CO binds to **Myoglobin** (causing muscle weakness and rhabdomyolysis).

### Clinical Features
Symptoms depend on the concentration of COHb in the blood.

| COHb Level (%) | Signs and Symptoms |
| :--- | :--- |
| **10–20%** | Mild frontal headache (throbbing), breathlessness on exertion. |
| **20–30%** | Throbbing headache, nausea, vomiting, irritability, muscle weakness. |
| **30–40%** | Severe headache, confusion, dizziness, visual disturbances, incoordination. |
| **40–50%** | Tachypnea, tachycardia, syncope, ataxia. |
| **50–60%** | Coma, intermittent convulsions, Cheyne-Stokes respiration. |
| **60–80%** | Depressed cardiac and respiratory function, death. |

#### Specific Syndromes and Signs
*   **[[Carbon Monoxide Automatism]]:** A state where the victim realizes the danger but due to muscle weakness and mental confusion, is unable to escape or call for help.
*   **Cutaneous Bullae:** Blisters seen on pressure areas (calves, buttocks, wrists) due to skin hypoxia.
*   **Parkinsonism:** Delayed neurological sequela due to basal ganglia damage.

> **Mnemonic for Symptoms: "COMA"**
> *   **C**onfusion/Cherry Red skin
> *   **O**xygen deficiency (Hypoxia)
> *   **M**uscle weakness/Myoglobinuria
> *   **A**utomatism

### Diagnosis and Tests
1.  **Spectroscopic Examination:** Most reliable. Characteristic absorption bands of COHb persist even after adding reducing agents.
2.  **Hoppe-Seyler’s Test:** Add 10% NaOH to blood.
    *   Normal blood $\rightarrow$ Brownish-green.
    *   CO blood $\rightarrow$ **Pink/Red**.
3.  **Kunkel’s Test:** Add 3% Tannic acid to blood.
    *   Normal blood $\rightarrow$ Brown precipitate.
    *   CO blood $\rightarrow$ **Pinkish-white precipitate**.
4.  **Dilution Test:** Dilute blood with water.
    *   Normal blood $\rightarrow$ Yellowish-brown.
    *   CO blood $\rightarrow$ **Pink**.

### Treatment
1.  **Immediate Removal:** Move patient to fresh air immediately.
2.  **Airway Management:** Maintain patent airway; artificial respiration if needed.
3.  **Oxygen Therapy:**
    *   **100% Oxygen:** Reduces CO half-life from ~320 mins (room air) to **~80 mins**.
    *   **[[Hyperbaric Oxygen]] (HBO):** Oxygen at 2-3 atm pressure. Reduces half-life to **~20 mins**. Recommended in severe cases (coma, COHb >25-40%, pregnancy).
4.  **Symptomatic:** Treat cerebral edema (Mannitol), acidosis, and shock.
    *   *Note:* Blood transfusion or exchange transfusion may be required in severe cases (usually >50% COHb).

### Autopsy Findings
#### External Findings
1.  **Cherry Red Discoloration:** Pathognomonic. Seen in [[Postmortem Lividity]] (hypostasis), fingernails, lips, and mucous membranes. (Visible when COHb >30%).
    *   *Note:* Cyanide and cold exposure also produce pinkish/red lividity.
2.  **Fine Froth:** Seen at mouth and nose (due to pulmonary edema).
3.  **Cutaneous Bullae:** Blisters containing clear or blood-stained fluid on pressure points.

#### Internal Findings
1.  **Blood:** Fluid and bright **Cherry Red**.
2.  **Muscles:** Bright red.
3.  **Lungs:** Congested, edematous, cherry red color.
4.  **Brain (Delayed Death):**
    *   **Bilateral Symmetrical Necrosis of [[Globus Pallidus]]** (Lenticular nucleus).
    *   Punctiform hemorrhages in white matter.
    *   Cerebral edema.
5.  **Heart:** Sub-endocardial hemorrhages, focal necrosis.

### Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Accidental:** Most common.
    *   Sleeping in closed rooms with charcoal fire/gas heaters (Winter tragedies).
    *   Leakage from gas geysers in bathrooms.
    *   Miners (explosions) and Firefighters (smoke inhalation).
    *   Couples in cars with AC/heater running in garages (Garage death).
*   **Suicidal:** Common in the West (directing car exhaust into the cabin), increasing in India.
*   **Homicidal:** Rare, but possible by incapacitating victim and exposing to gas.
