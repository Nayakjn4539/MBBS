# Classification of Arboviral Diseases

Arboviruses (Arthropod-borne viruses) are a diverse group of viruses transmitted to humans by hematophagous (blood-sucking) arthropods like mosquitoes, ticks, and sandflies.

### 1. Classification Based on Virus Family (Antigenic Structure)

| Group | Virus Family | Examples of Diseases |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Group A** | **Alphaviruses** (Togaviridae) | [[Chikungunya]], Sindbis, O'Nyong-Nyong, Ross River virus |
| **Group B** | **Flaviviruses** (Flaviviridae) | [[Dengue]], [[Japanese Encephalitis (JE)]], [[Yellow Fever]], [[Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD)]], [[Zika Virus]], West Nile Fever |
| **Others** | **Bunyaviridae** | Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever, Sandfly Fever, Hantavirus |

**Mnemonic for Classification:**
*   **Alpha** males eat **Chik**en (**Alpha**virus = **Chik**ungunya)
*   **Flavi**ored **Jel**ly **D**onuts are **Y**ummy (**Flavi**virus = **J**E, **D**engue, **Y**ellow fever)

### 2. Classification Based on Clinical Syndrome
Clinically, arboviral diseases often present as one of three syndromes,:

1.  **Febrile Illness (Arthralgia/Rash):** Dengue fever, Chikungunya, Sandfly fever.
2.  **Hemorrhagic Fevers:** Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF), Yellow Fever, Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever.
3.  **Encephalitis (CNS Involvement):** Japanese Encephalitis, West Nile Encephalitis.

# Epidemiology of Dengue Fever

Dengue is an acute viral infection with potential for fatal complications. It is endemic in more than 100 countries.

### 1. Agent Factors
*   **Agent:** [[Dengue Virus]] (DENV), a Group B **Flavivirus** (Single-stranded RNA).
*   **Serotypes:** There are **4 Serotypes**: DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4.
*   **Immunity:** Infection with one serotype confers **lifelong immunity** to *that* specific serotype but only short-term cross-protection against others.
*   **Virulence:** Secondary infection (re-infection with a different serotype) increases the risk of **Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF)** and **Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS)** due to antibody-dependent enhancement,.

### 2. Vector Factors
*   **Vector:** Primarily **[[Aedes aegypti]]**; *Aedes albopictus* is a secondary vector.
*   **Habits of Aedes aegypti:**
    *   **Feeding:** It is a **day biter** and a **nervous feeder** (bites multiple people to complete a blood meal), leading to clusters of cases.
    *   **Breeding:** Domestic breeder. Breeds in **artificial water collections** (flower pots, coolers, discarded tyres, coconut shells).
    *   **Appearance:** Known as the **"Tiger Mosquito"** due to white stripes on the legs and body.
*   **Infectivity:** The mosquito becomes infective 8–10 days after biting an infected person (**Extrinsic Incubation Period**) and remains infective for life.

### 3. Host Factors
*   **Host:** Man is the reservoir. No known animal reservoir exists for urban dengue.
*   **Age/Sex:** Affects all ages and genders. DHF is more common in children,.
*   **Infective Period:** A patient is infective to the mosquito from **1 day before to 5 days after** the onset of fever.

### 4. Environmental Factors
*   **Season:** Transmission peaks during and after the **rainy season** (monsoon) due to increased breeding sites.
*   **Conditions:** Favored by high humidity (60–80%) and temperatures between 16°C and 30°C.

### 5. Mode of Transmission
*   Transmitted by the bite of an infected female *Aedes* mosquito.
*   **Incubation Period (Intrinsic):** **5–6 days** (Range 3–10 days).

**Clinical Relevance:**
*   **Classical Dengue:** "Break-bone fever" (severe myalgia), retro-orbital pain, saddleback fever, and rash.
*   **DHF/DSS:** Defined by plasma leakage (rising hematocrit), thrombocytopenia (<100,000), and shock (narrow pulse pressure <20 mmHg),.
*   **Tourniquet Test:** A bedside test used to screen for DHF (>20 petechiae per square inch is positive).

# Control of Dengue Fever

There is no specific antiviral treatment; management is symptomatic (fluid replacement). Prevention relies on vector control.

### 1. Vector Control (Anti-Larval Measures)
This is the primary method of control.
*   **Environmental Management (Source Reduction):**
    *   Eliminate breeding sites: Cover water containers, empty coolers weekly (**Dry Day** observance), dispose of tyres and trash properly.
    *   Cover overhead tanks and cisterns.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Application of **[[Temephos]]** (Abate) granules (1 ppm) in potable water containers.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Use of larvivorous fish like ***Gambusia*** and ***Poecilia*** (Guppy).
    *   Use of *Bacillus thuringiensis* (biolarvicide).

### 2. Vector Control (Anti-Adult Measures)
*   **Space Sprays:** Pyrethrum extract or Malathion fogging is used during epidemics to kill adult mosquitoes rapidly.
*   **Residual Sprays:** Indoor residual sprays are generally *not* effective because *Aedes* rests on hanging objects (clothes, curtains) rather than walls.

### 3. Personal Protection
*   Use of **[[Insecticide Treated Bed Nets (ITBN)]]** or Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs).
*   Wearing long sleeves and using repellents (DEET, Picaridin).
*   Screening of windows and doors.

### 4. Surveillance (Dengue Indices)
Used to monitor *Aedes* density:
1.  **House Index:** % of houses positive for larvae.
2.  **Container Index:** % of water-holding containers positive for larvae.
3.  **Breteau Index:** Number of positive containers per 100 houses.

### 5. Vaccination
*   **Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV):** First licensed vaccine.
    *   **Type:** Live recombinant tetravalent vaccine.
    *   **Dose:** 3 injections (0, 6, 12 months).
    *   **Indication:** Individuals 9–45 years living in endemic areas.
    *   **Warning:** It is **not** recommended for seronegative individuals (those who have never had dengue) as it may increase the risk of severe dengue upon subsequent natural infection.
