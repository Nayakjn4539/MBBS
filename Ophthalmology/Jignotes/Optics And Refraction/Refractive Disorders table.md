# Refractive Disorders: Comparative Overview

The following table details the major [[Refractive Errors]] (Ametropia) and anomalies of accommodation, outlining their optical defects, underlying pathogenic mechanisms, and management strategies.

### Table of Refractive Disorders

| Disorder | Definition & Optical Defect | Etiopathogenesis (Mechanism) | Treatment & Management |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Myopia]]**<br>(Short-sightedness) | Parallel rays of light from infinity focus **in front of the [[Retina]]** with accommodation at rest.<br>Patient sees near objects clearly, but distant objects are blurred. | **1. Axial:** Increased anteroposterior length of eyeball (MC). **1mm $\uparrow$ in AL $\approx$ 3D myopia**.<br>**2. Curvatural:** Increased curvature of [[Cornea]] or [[Lens]] (e.g., [[Keratoconus]], [[Lenticonus]]). **1mm $\downarrow$ in radius $\approx$ 6D myopia**.<br>**3. Index:** Increased refractive index of lens nucleus (e.g., Nuclear sclerosis in cataracts).<br>**4. Positional:** Anterior displacement of lens. | **Optical:**<br>• **Concave (-) lenses** (Diverging lenses).<br>• Contact Lenses (useful for high myopia).<br>**Surgical:**<br>• **Corneal:** [[Radial Keratotomy]] (obsolete), [[PRK]], [[LASIK]], [[SMILE]].<br>• **Lenticular:** [[Phakic IOL]] (ICL), Refractive Lens Exchange (for very high myopia). |
| **[[Hypermetropia]]**<br>(Long-sightedness) | Parallel rays of light from infinity focus **behind the [[Retina]]** with accommodation at rest.<br>Patient may have blurry near vision (or distance vision if high error). | **1. Axial:** Short anteroposterior length. **1mm $\downarrow$ in AL $\approx$ 3D hypermetropia**.<br>**2. Curvatural:** Flattening of cornea/lens (e.g., [[Cornea Plana]]).<br>**3. Index:** Decreased refractive index of cortex (Cortical cataract) or increased index of vitreous.<br>**4. Positional:** Posterior displacement of lens.<br>**5. Absence of lens:** [[Aphakia]]. | **Optical:**<br>• **Convex (+) lenses** (Converging lenses).<br>• Contact Lenses.<br>**Surgical:**<br>• Hyperopic [[LASIK]].<br>• Conductive Keratoplasty (CK).<br>• Refractive Lens Exchange. |
| **[[Astigmatism]]** | Refraction varies in different meridians of the eye. Light does not focus on a point but forms **focal lines** (Sturm's Conoid). | **1. Corneal:** Unequal curvature of cornea (MC).<br>**2. Lenticular:** Unequal curvature or tilting of lens.<br>**3. Retinal:** Oblique placement of macula.<br>• *Regular:* Principal meridians are 90° apart.<br>• *Irregular:* Irregular changes in refractive power (e.g., corneal scars, keratoconus). | **Optical:**<br>• **Cylindrical lenses** (for regular astigmatism).<br>• **Toric Contact Lenses**.<br>• Rigid Gas Permeable (RGP) lenses for irregular astigmatism.<br>**Surgical:**<br>• [[Astigmatic Keratotomy]] (AK) / Limbal Relaxing Incisions (LRI).<br>• Toric IOLs.<br>• Photo-astigmatic Refractive Keratectomy (PARK) / LASIK. |
| **[[Presbyopia]]** | Physiological insufficiency of accommodation leading to progressive fall in near vision.<br>*Not a refractive error per se, but an aging anomaly.* | **1. Lens Hardening:** Progressive sclerosis of lens substance making it less mouldable.<br>**2. Capsular Elasticity:** Decrease in elasticity of lens capsule.<br>**3. Ciliary Muscle:** Age-related weakening. | **Optical:**<br>• **Convex (+) lenses** added to distance correction.<br>• Spectacles: Bifocals, Trifocals, Progressive Addition Lenses (PALs).<br>• Monovision Contact Lenses.<br>**Surgical:**<br>• Multifocal IOLs, Monovision LASIK (under trial). |
| **[[Aphakia]]** | Absence of the crystalline lens from the pupillary area.<br>Creates a state of **high hypermetropia**. | **1. Surgical:** Removal of cataract (MC).<br>**2. Traumatic:** Extrusion or dislocation of lens.<br>**3. Congenital:** Rare. | **Optical:**<br>• **[[Intraocular Lens]] (IOL)** implantation (Treatment of Choice).<br>• Contact Lenses.<br>• Aphakic Spectacles (High + lenses, causes 30% magnification and roving ring scotoma). |
| **[[Pseudophakia]]** | Condition where the natural lens is replaced by an artificial **[[Intraocular Lens]] (IOL)**. | Post-cataract surgery or refractive lens exchange. | • Emmetropia (Ideal goal).<br>• **Consecutive Myopia/Hypermetropia:** Treated with thin spectacles or LASIK if error is significant.<br>• Reading glasses usually required (unless Multifocal IOL used). |
| **[[Anisometropia]]** | Unequal refractive state of the two eyes (Difference > 2.5D is significant). | • Developmental/Congenital.<br>• Unilateral [[Aphakia]].<br>• Trauma or Surgery altering one eye's refraction.<br>• Assymetric axial lengths. | • **Contact Lenses** (Best for high degrees to minimize image size difference).<br>• Spectacles (tolerated up to 4D difference).<br>• Refractive Surgery or IOLs. |
| **[[Aniseikonia]]** | Difference in the **size and/or shape** of the retinal images between the two eyes. | • **Optical:** High anisometropia corrected with spectacles (Knapp's law application).<br>• **Retinal:** Stretching or edema of retina displacing photoreceptors.<br>• **Cortical:** Asymmetrical simultaneous perception. | • **Iseikonic Lenses** (change magnification without changing power).<br>• Contact Lenses.<br>• Intraocular Lenses. |

### Clinical Implications

*   **[[Myopia]] & Retinal Health:** High myopia (Pathological Myopia) is not just a refractive error but a disease associated with degenerative changes like **Posterior Staphyloma**, **Lacquer Cracks**, **Foster-Fuchs spots**, and predisposes to **Retinal Detachment**.
*   **[[Hypermetropia]] & Glaucoma:** The hypermetropic eye is typically small with a shallow anterior chamber, predisposing it to **Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma (PACG)**.
*   **Astigmatism & Head Posture:** Patients with uncorrected astigmatism may adopt a head tilt (torticollis) to align their visual axes to minimize distortion.
*   **Anisometropia & Amblyopia:** Significant uncorrected anisometropia in children is a major cause of **Amblyopia** (lazy eye) due to abnormal binocular interaction and suppression of the blurred image.
*   **Aphakia Optics:** Aphakic spectacles cause **30% magnification** and a **Jack-in-the-box phenomenon** (roving ring scotoma), making them optically inferior to IOLs or contact lenses.

### Important Mnemonics

*   **Astigmatism Types:** "With **C**v, Against **V**c"
    *   **W**ith the rule: Corrected by **C**oncave cylinder at 180° or Con**v**ex at 90°.
    *   **A**gainst the rule: Corrected by Con**v**ex cylinder at 180° or Con**c**ave at 90°.
*   **Sturm's Conoid** (Optics of Astigmatism):
    *   **V**ertical rays focus **F**irst (in regular astigmatism with the rule).
    *   **C**ircle of **L**east **D**iffusion: Located between the two focal lines; provides the best vision in mixed astigmatism.
