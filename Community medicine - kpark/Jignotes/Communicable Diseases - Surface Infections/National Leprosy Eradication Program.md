# National Leprosy Eradication Program (NLEP)

### **1. Disease Profile: Leprosy (Hansen's Disease)**

**Agent Factor:**
*   **Causative Agent:** *[[Mycobacterium leprae]]*.
*   **Characteristics:** Acid-fast, intracellular bacilli. Occurs in clumps called **Globi**.
*   **Viability:** Can survive in dried nasal secretions for 9 days and moist soil for 46 days.
*   **Generation Time:** 12–13 days (very slow growing).

**Host Factors:**
*   **Source of Infection:** Multibacillary cases (lepromatous and borderline lepromatous).
*   **Portal of Exit:** **Nose** (major route) and broken skin.
*   **Infectivity:** High infectivity but **low pathogenicity**.
*   **Attack Rate:** 4.4% to 12% among household contacts.

**Transmission:**
*   **Mode:** Droplet infection (aerosols from sneezing/coughing of untreated MB cases).
*   **Contact:** Prolonged, close contact (skin-to-skin or fomites).

**Incubation Period:**
*   Long and variable. Average **3 to 5 years** (Range: few months to 20+ years).

### **2. Clinical Features and Diagnosis**

The diagnosis under NLEP is primarily **clinical**.

**Cardinal Signs (At least ONE must be present):**
1.  **Hypopigmented or reddish skin patch** with definite **loss of sensation** (anesthesia).
2.  **Thickened peripheral nerves** with loss of sensation or muscle weakness (paresis/paralysis) in area supplied.
3.  Demonstration of **Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB)** in skin smear.

> **Clinical Relevance:** The earliest sensation lost is usually **temperature**, followed by light touch and then pain.

### **3. NLEP: Program Overview**

*   **Launched:** 1983 (Redesignated from National Leprosy Control Program of 1955).
*   **Milestone:** India achieved the goal of **Elimination of Leprosy** (Prevalence Rate <1 case per 10,000 population) in **December 2005**.
*   **Current Goal:** **Leprosy Free India** (Zero transmission, Zero disability, Zero stigma).

**Operational Classification for Treatment:**

| Type | Definition (NLEP) | Bacteriological Index (BI) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Paucibacillary (PB)** | 1–5 skin lesions AND/OR only 1 nerve involved. | Negative (BI < 2) |
| **Multibacillary (MB)** | ≥ 6 skin lesions AND/OR > 1 nerve involved. | Positive (BI ≥ 2) |

### **4. Treatment: Multi-Drug Therapy (MDT)**

MDT is the cornerstone of NLEP. It uses bactericidal drugs to interrupt transmission. Treatment is provided in **Blister Packs** (Color-coded).

**MDT Regimens (Adults):**

| Type | Drugs & Dosage | Duration | Pack Color |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Paucibacillary (PB)** | **Rifampicin:** 600 mg (Once monthly, Supervised)<br>**Dapsone:** 100 mg (Daily, Self-administered) | **6 Months** (Complete within 9 months) | **Green** |
| **Multibacillary (MB)** | **Rifampicin:** 600 mg (Once monthly, Supervised)<br>**Clofazimine:** 300 mg (Once monthly, Supervised) + 50 mg (Daily)<br>**Dapsone:** 100 mg (Daily, Self-administered) | **12 Months** (Complete within 18 months) | **Red** |

*   **Children (10-14 years):** Doses are generally halved. Packs are **Pink** (PB) and **Blue** (MB).
*   **Rifampicin:** Most potent bactericidal; renders patient non-infectious in days.
*   **Clofazimine:** Anti-leprosy + Anti-inflammatory (prevents reactions). Causes skin discoloration.

**Mnemonic for MDT Drugs:** **RDC** (Like the district courts)
*   **R**ifampicin
*   **D**apsone
*   **C**lofazimine

### **5. Management of Lepra Reactions**

Reactions are acute inflammatory episodes. They are medical emergencies to prevent disability.

| Feature | **Type 1 (Reversal Reaction)** | **Type 2 (ENL - Erythema Nodosum Leprosum)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Occurrence** | Borderline types (BT, BB, BL) | Multibacillary (BL, LL) |
| **Mechanism** | Cell-Mediated Immunity (CMI) boost | Antigen-Antibody complex (Humoral) |
| **Signs** | Inflammation of existing patches, neuritis | **New** tender red nodules, fever, joint pain |
| **Treatment** | Steroids (Prednisolone) + Analgesics | Steroids + Clofazimine + Analgesics (Thalidomide is DOC but contraindicated in women of childbearing age) |

*   **Note:** **Never stop MDT** during reactions.

### **6. New Initiatives and Strategies**

1.  **[[Leprosy Case Detection Campaign (LCDC)]]:** Active case finding in high endemic districts (house-to-house search).
2.  **Sparsh Leprosy Awareness Campaign:** To reduce stigma and discrimination.
3.  **ASHA Based Surveillance (ABSULS):** Incentives for ASHA for detecting new cases.
4.  **NIKUSTH:** A web-based reporting system for leprosy.
5.  **Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP):** Administration of **Single Dose Rifampicin (SDR)** to eligible contacts of leprosy patients to break the chain of transmission.
6.  **Disability Prevention & Medical Rehabilitation (DPMR):**
    *   Supply of MCR (Micro-Cellular Rubber) footwear for anesthetic feet.
    *   Reconstructive Surgery (RCS) for deformities (Claw hand, foot drop) with welfare allowance (₹8000).

### **7. Indicators for Monitoring**

*   **Prevalence Rate (PR):** Case load.
*   **Annual New Case Detection Rate (ANCDR):** Main indicator for transmission.
*   **Treatment Completion Rate:** Operational efficiency.
*   **Grade II Disability Rate:** Indicates delayed detection (Target: <1 per million).

### **8. Prevention and Vaccination**

*   **Chemoprophylaxis:** Single dose Rifampicin for contacts.
*   **Vaccine:** **MIP (Mycobacterium Indicus Pranii)** vaccine is developed in India and is being introduced. BCG also provides some cross-protection.
