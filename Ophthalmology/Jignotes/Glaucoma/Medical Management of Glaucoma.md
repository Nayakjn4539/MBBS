# [[Glaucoma]] > Medical Management of Glaucoma

### Medical Management of Glaucoma

The primary goal of medical management in [[glaucoma]] is to lower the [[intraocular pressure]] (IOP) to a "target pressure" to prevent further damage to the [[retinal ganglion cells]] and optic nerve axons. 

This is achieved by either **decreasing aqueous production** or **increasing aqueous outflow**.

### 1. Prostaglandin Analogues (PGAs)
These are currently the **first-line drugs** of choice for [[primary open-angle glaucoma]] (POAG) due to their efficacy and once-daily dosing compliance.

*   **Mechanism of Action:**
    *   They lower IOP by increasing **uveoscleral outflow**.
    *   Latanoprostene bunod (Nitric oxide donating PG analog) has a dual mechanism: Latanoprost increases uveoscleral outflow, while Nitric Oxide relaxes the [[trabecular meshwork]] increasing trabecular outflow.

*   **Common Drugs:**
    *   [[Latanoprost]] (0.005%)
    *   [[Bimatoprost]] (0.03%)
    *   [[Travoprost]] (0.004%)
    *   [[Tafluprost]] (Preservative-free).

*   **Side Effects:**
    *   **Ocular:** [[Conjunctival hyperemia]] (redness), stinging, **iris hyperpigmentation** (irreversible), **hypertrichosis** (growth of eyelashes), lengthening of eyelashes, and periorbital fat atrophy (deepening of the upper eyelid sulcus).
    *   **Significant Complications:** Reactivation of [[herpes keratitis]] and **Cystoid Macular Edema ([[CME]])**, especially in aphakic/pseudophakic eyes.

*   **Clinical Implications:**
    *   **Contraindicated** in active [[uveitis]] and patients with a history of herpetic keratitis.
    *   Avoid in unilateral treatment if cosmetic side effects (heterochromia, lash growth) are a concern for the patient.

### 2. Beta-Adrenergic Blockers (Beta-Blockers)
Formerly the gold standard, now often used as a second-line or adjunctive therapy.

*   **Mechanism of Action:**
    *   Decrease **aqueous humour production** by blocking beta receptors in the non-pigmented epithelium of the [[ciliary body]].

*   **Classification:**
    1.  **Non-Selective (Block $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$):** [[Timolol]], [[Levobunolol]], [[Metipranolol]], [[Carteolol]].
    2.  **Cardioselective (Block $\beta_1$):** [[Betaxolol]].

*   **Side Effects:**
    *   **Systemic:** **Bronchospasm** (can precipitate status asthmaticus), **bradycardia**, heart block, hypotension, fatigue, depression, lethargy, decreased libido.
        *   *Note:* They can mask symptoms of hypoglycemia in diabetics.
    *   **Ocular:** Corneal anesthesia, dry eye, punctate epithelial erosions.

*   **Clinical Implications:**
    *   **Contraindicated** in patients with [[bronchial asthma]], COPD, and cardiac block/bradycardia.
    *   **Betaxolol** is safer for asthmatics (cardioselective) but is less potent in lowering IOP compared to Timolol.
    *   **Carteolol** raises triglycerides/lowers HDL the least and has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (less bradycardia).

### 3. Alpha-2 Adrenergic Agonists
*   **Mechanism of Action:**
    *   **Dual Action (Brimonidine):** Decreases **aqueous production** AND increases **uveoscleral outflow**.
    *   Apraclonidine acts primarily by decreasing production.

*   **Drugs:**
    *   [[Brimonidine]] (0.2%): Highly selective alpha-2 agonist. Also exhibits **neuroprotective** properties.
    *   [[Apraclonidine]] (0.5%, 1%): Primarily used to prevent IOP spikes after laser procedures (e.g., [[laser iridotomy]]).

*   **Side Effects:**
    *   **Ocular:** Allergic **follicular conjunctivitis** (delayed type IV hypersensitivity), lid retraction (Apraclonidine), mydriasis.
    *   **Systemic:** Xerostomia (dry mouth), drowsiness/sedation, fatigue, hypotension.

*   **Clinical Implications:**
    *   **Absolute Contraindication:** **Infants and young children (<2 years)** due to risk of **CNS depression and apnea** because the drug crosses the blood-brain barrier.
    *   Contraindicated in patients taking MAO inhibitors.

### 4. Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors (CAIs)
*   **Mechanism of Action:**
    *   Inhibit the enzyme [[carbonic anhydrase]] (isoenzyme II) in the ciliary epithelium, reducing bicarbonate formation and thus **decreasing aqueous secretion**.

*   **Types:**
    *   **Topical:** [[Dorzolamide]], [[Brinzolamide]].
    *   **Systemic (Oral/IV):** [[Acetazolamide]], [[Methazolamide]].

*   **Side Effects:**
    *   **Topical:** Stinging/burning, bitter taste, superficial punctate keratitis (SPK), blurred vision.
    *   **Systemic (Acetazolamide):** **Paresthesia** (tingling in fingers/toes), metallic taste, malaise, GI upset, **hypokalemia**, **metabolic acidosis**, **renal stones**. Rare but severe: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, aplastic anemia.

*   **Clinical Implications:**
    *   Use systemic acetazolamide cautiously in patients with sulfa allergies (cross-reactivity).
    *   Avoid systemic CAIs in patients with renal stones or severe hepatic/renal disease.
    *   Topical CAIs are often used when beta-blockers are contraindicated.

### 5. Parasympathomimetics (Miotics)
*   **Mechanism of Action:**
    *   Stimulate muscarinic receptors causing contraction of the longitudinal muscle of the ciliary body. This pulls on the **scleral spur**, opening the [[trabecular meshwork]] and increasing **trabecular (conventional) outflow**.
    *   Also causes miosis (pupil constriction), pulling the peripheral iris away from the trabecular meshwork in [[angle-closure glaucoma]].

*   **Drug:** [[Pilocarpine]] (1%, 2%, 4%).

*   **Side Effects:**
    *   **Ocular:** **Brow ache** (ciliary muscle spasm), induced myopia (accommodation spasm), dimness of vision (small pupil), **cataract**, **retinal detachment**, iris cysts.
    *   **Systemic:** Salivation, sweating, bradycardia (rare with drops).

*   **Clinical Implications:**
    *   **Contraindicated** in **uveitic glaucoma** (increases blood-aqueous barrier breakdown and posterior synechiae) and **neovascular glaucoma**.
    *   Avoid in young myopes (risk of retinal detachment).
    *   **Drug of Choice** for acute attack of primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG), usually started after IOP has been lowered by systemic agents (as the sphincter is ischemic at very high pressures >40-50 mmHg).

### 6. Hyperosmotic Agents
*   **Mechanism of Action:**
    *   Increase blood osmolality, creating an osmotic gradient that dehydrates the [[vitreous humour]], causing a rapid fall in IOP.

*   **Drugs:**
    *   **IV:** [[Mannitol]] (20%).
    *   **Oral:** [[Glycerol]] (50%), [[Isosorbide]].

*   **Side Effects:**
    *   Dehydration, headache, backache, nausea.
    *   **Mannitol:** Can precipitate Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) or pulmonary edema due to increased blood volume.
    *   **Glycerol:** Metabolized to glucose; can cause **hyperglycemia** and ketoacidosis in diabetics.

*   **Clinical Implications:**
    *   Primarily used for **emergency management** of Acute Congestive Glaucoma.
    *   **Isosorbide** is metabolically inert and safe for diabetics.

### 7. Rho Kinase Inhibitors (Novel Class)
*   **Drug:** [[Netarsudil]].
*   **Mechanism of Action:**
    *   Increases **trabecular outflow** by relaxing the trabecular meshwork (actin-myosin contraction inhibition).
    *   Decreases episcleral venous pressure.
*   **Side Effects:** Conjunctival hyperemia ("red eye"), **corneal verticillata** (honeycomb-like corneal deposits), subconjunctival hemorrhage.
