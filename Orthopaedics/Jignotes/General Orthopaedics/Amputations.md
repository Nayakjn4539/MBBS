# [[General Orthopaedics]] > Amputations

### Definition
**Amputation** is the surgical removal of a limb or a part of a limb through the bone.
**Disarticulation** is the removal of a limb through a joint,,.

### Indications
The indications for amputation are classically summarized by the **"6 D's"**,:

1.  **Dead Limb:** [[Peripheral vascular disease]] (PVD) resulting in gangrene (most common cause), severe thermal burns, or frostbite.
2.  **Dying Limb:** Severe trauma where repair is impossible or blood supply is irretrievably lost (e.g., crush injury).
3.  **Dangerous Limb:** Malignant [[Bone Tumors]] (e.g., [[Osteosarcoma]]) or potentially fatal infections like [[Gas gangrene]] or necrotizing fasciitis.
4.  **Damaged/Destroyed Limb:** Severe trauma where limb salvage is technically possible but would result in a functionless limb (e.g., severe brachial plexus injury with flail arm).
5.  **Denervated Limb:** Congenital absence of sensation leading to trophic ulcers and destruction (e.g., spina bifida, leprosy).
6.  **Deformed Limb:** Severe congenital deformities affecting function or fitting of footwear (e.g., severe [[Fibular hemimelia]]).

### Assessment for Amputation in Trauma
In severe trauma, the decision to amputate versus salvage is critical. The **Mangled Extremity Severity Score ([[MESS]])** is used. A score of $\ge 7$ usually indicates amputation,.

**MESS Criteria:**
*   **Skeletal/Soft-Tissue Injury:** Low energy to High energy/Crush.
*   **Limb Ischemia:** Pulse reduced to pulseless (Score doubles if ischemia > 6 hours).
*   **Shock:** Normotensive to hypotensive.
*   **Age:** Score increases with age.

### Types of Amputations

#### 1. Based on Procedure
| Type | Description | Indication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Provisional (Open/Guillotine)** | The skin and soft tissues are not closed primarily. The wound is left open to drain. | Severe infection, [[Gas gangrene]], or severely contaminated traumatic wounds where primary closure risks sepsis,. |
| **Definitive (Closed)** | Flaps are sutured and the stump is closed primarily. | Elective amputations, clean trauma, or tumors where primary healing is expected. |

#### 2. Based on Weight Bearing
*   **End-bearing Amputation:** Weight is transferred through the distal end of the stump. The scar must not be terminal. The bone end must be solid (cancellous), usually cut through or near a joint.
    *   *Examples:* [[Syme's amputation]], [[Knee disarticulation]].
*   **Non-end-bearing Amputation:** Weight is transferred through the sides of the stump (e.g., ischial tuberosity or patellar tendon). The scar can be terminal.
    *   *Examples:* All upper limb amputations, most [[Below Knee Amputations]] (BKA), [[Above Knee Amputations]] (AKA),.

### Principles of Amputation Surgery

**A. Tourniquet Use**
*   Used in most cases to minimize blood loss.
*   **Contraindicated** in ischemic limbs (PVD) as it may compromise already poor circulation,.

**B. Level of Selection**
*   **Trauma/Tumor:** Determine by the zone of injury or tumor margin.
*   **Ischemia:** Determined by the level of adequate bleeding/vascularity. The "Site of Election" is determined by disease level and prosthetic requirements.

**C. Skin Flaps**
*   Must be mobile and sensitive.
*   **Equal Flaps:** Anterior and posterior flaps of equal length (scar at the end).
*   **Long Posterior Flap:** Often used in [[Below Knee Amputation]] (Burgess technique) because posterior calf skin has better blood supply,.
*   **Skew Flaps:** Used when vascularity is compromised in specific patterns.

**D. Muscle Management**
Proper handling prevents muscle atrophy and aids prosthetic control.
*   **[[Myoplasty]]:** Antagonistic muscles are sutured to each other over the bone end (e.g., quadriceps to hamstrings).
*   **[[Myodesis]]:** Muscles are sutured directly to the bone through drill holes. This provides a more stable stump but requires better vascularity,,.

**E. Nerve Management**
*   Nerves are pulled gently, ligated (for large nerves with accompanying vessels), and cut cleanly with a sharp blade.
*   They are allowed to retract proximally into the soft tissue, well away from the stump end, to prevent the formation of a painful [[Neuroma]],.

**F. Bone Management**
*   Periosteum is stripped only to the level of the bone cut (excessive stripping causes [[Ring sequestrum]]).
*   Bone edges are beveled and filed smooth to prevent sharp spikes from injuring the skin flap (e.g., anterior tibia beveling),.

**G. Hemostasis**
*   Major vessels are doubly ligated. The tourniquet should be released *before* closure to secure hemostasis.

### Specific Amputations

#### Lower Limb
1.  **[[Syme's Amputation]] (Ankle Disarticulation):**
    *   Removal of the foot with preservation of the heel pad for weight-bearing.
    *   Malleoli are trimmed to reduce bulbousness.
2.  **[[Below Knee Amputation]] (BKA):**
    *   Most common major amputation.
    *   Ideal length: 12–15 cm below the knee joint (Burgess long posterior flap technique is standard),.
3.  **[[Above Knee Amputation]] (AKA):**
    *   Ideal length: ~12 cm above the knee joint to allow space for the prosthetic knee mechanism.

#### Upper Limb
1.  **General Rule:** Preserve as much length as possible. Even small stumps can power prosthesis or assist in bimanual tasks.
2.  **[[Krukenberg Amputation]]:**
    *   Used in blind patients with bilateral below-elbow amputation.
    *   Radius and ulna are separated and covered with skin to create pincer-like forceps for tactile sensation and grasping.

### Complications

| Timing | Complication | Clinical Features & Management |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Early** | **[[Hematoma]]** | Due to poor hemostasis. Delays healing, predisposes to infection. Aspiration or drainage required,. |
| | **Infection** | Common in PVD/Diabetes. May require higher amputation. |
| | **Skin Necrosis** | Due to tension on flaps or poor vascularity. |
| | **[[Gas Gangrene]]** | Recurrence in Clostridial infections if open amputation wasn't performed. |
| **Late** | **[[Neuroma]]** | Painful nodule at nerve end. Prevented by high resection. Treated by excision or steroid injection. |
| | **[[Phantom Limb Pain]]** | Pain felt in the absent limb. Difficult to treat; mirror therapy, desensitization, or medication used. |
| | **Phantom Sensation** | Feeling that the limb is still present (not painful). |
| | **Joint Contracture** | Flexion deformities (e.g., knee flexion in BKA). Prevented by early physiotherapy and positioning. |
| | **Bony Spur** | New bone formation at the stump end. |

### Post-Operative Care & Rehabilitation
1.  **Stump Care:**
    *   Rigid or soft dressings to control edema.
    *   Figure-of-eight bandaging (never circular) to shape the stump into a cone for prosthetic fitting.
2.  **Exercises:** Strengthening muscles and preventing contractures (e.g., preventing hip flexion contracture in AKA).
3.  **Prosthetics:**
    *   **[[SACH Foot]] (Solid Ankle Cushion Heel):** Common, durable, limited motion.
    *   **[[Jaipur Foot]]:** Culturally appropriate for Indian subcontinent (allows squatting, barefoot walking, waterproof, low cost).
