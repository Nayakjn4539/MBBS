# [[HEALTH CARE OF THE COMMUNITY]] > Networking with voluntary health agencies plays an important role in health care delivery

### **Networking with Voluntary Health Agencies in Health Care Delivery**

**Definition**
A [[Voluntary Health Agency]] (VHA) is defined as an organization administered by an autonomous board which holds meetings, collects funds for its support chiefly from private sources, and expends money, whether with or without paid workers, in conducting a program directed primarily to furthering public health by providing health services, health education, or by advancing research or legislation for health.

**The "Motor Truck" Analogy**
To understand the importance of networking, one must understand the operational difference between government and voluntary agencies:
*   **Official Agencies (Government):** Likened to **"Railway Trunk Lines"**. They must run on tracks established by law and cannot easily deviate.
*   **Voluntary Agencies:** Likened to **"Motor Trucks"**. They can penetrate the "by-ways" and remote areas where the official system may not reach effectively.

Networking between these two entities ensures that health care reaches the *social periphery*.

### **Functions and Importance of Networking**

Networking allows the public health sector to leverage the unique strengths of VHAs. Their role can be summarized by the mnemonic: **"SPEED G"** (Supplementing, Pioneering, Education, Demonstration, Guarding).

1.  **Supplementing the Work of Government Agencies**
    *   Government agencies operate under financial and statutory restrictions.
    *   VHAs help by lending personnel or contributing funds/equipment.
    *   *Example:* During disasters, the [[Indian Red Cross Society]] supplements government relief efforts with medical supplies and milk powder.

2.  **Pioneering (Innovation)**
    *   VHAs are free to explore new ways of doing things (Research).
    *   When these pioneer efforts succeed, the government can integrate them into the national system.
    *   *Example:* The [[Family Planning]] movement in India was spearheaded by voluntary agencies (like the Family Planning Association of India) long before the government accepted it as a national policy.

3.  **Education**
    *   Government agencies often struggle to cope with the massive need for health education, especially given high illiteracy rates.
    *   VHAs supplement this by educating the masses on health, hygiene, and nutrition.

4.  **Demonstration**
    *   VHAs often set up experimental projects to prove efficacy.
    *   *Example:* The **Rockefeller Foundation** demonstrated the use of [[bore hole latrines]] to solve the problem of [[hookworm]] in India. This later became an essential part of the government's environmental sanitation program.

5.  **Guarding the Work of Government Agencies**
    *   VHAs act as a "watchdog" or critic.
    *   By setting good examples and monitoring government work, they guide and criticize state health activities to ensure quality and accountability.

6.  **Advancing Health Legislation**
    *   VHAs mobilize public opinion to support or demand laws beneficial to community health.

### **Advantages of Networking with VHAs**

*   **Flexibility:** VHAs are not bound by rigid red tape and can respond quickly to emergencies.
*   **Credibility:** They often have better rapport with the local population compared to government officials.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** They often work with low operative costs and utilize volunteerism.
*   **Reaching the Unreached:** They serve vulnerable groups like the handicapped, destitute women, and lepers whom the general system might miss.

### **Important Voluntary Health Agencies in India**

Networking involves coordination with specific agencies for specific diseases or needs:

| Agency Name | Area of Focus / Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Indian Red Cross Society]]** (Est. 1920) | Disaster relief, blood banks, maternal & child welfare, first aid. |
| **[[Hind Kusht Nivaran Sangh]]** | Leprosy control, health education, rehabilitation of leprosy patients. |
| **[[Tuberculosis Association of India]]** | Organizes TB Seal Campaign, trains doctors/health visitors, supports sanatoriums. |
| **[[Family Planning Association of India]]** | Propagating family planning, running clinics, training personnel. |
| **[[Bharat Sevak Samaj]]** | Sanitation improvements in villages, helping people achieve health through own actions. |
| **[[Central Social Welfare Board]]** | Focus on women and children welfare, family and child welfare services in rural areas. |
| **The Kasturba Memorial Fund** | Improving the lot of women in villages (Gram Sevikas). |
| **All India Blind Relief Society** | Organizes eye relief camps. |

### **Clinical Relevance**

*   **Referral:** A Primary Health Center (PHC) doctor must network with agencies like the **Blind Relief Society** for cataract camps or the **Leprosy Mission** for reconstructive surgery referrals which may not be available at the PHC level.
*   **Resource Mobilization:** During an epidemic or disaster, the medical officer must coordinate with the **Red Cross** for immediate supplies (blankets, medicines) that government stores may take time to procure.
*   **Rehabilitation:** For chronic conditions (e.g., mental retardation, physical handicap), medical therapy is insufficient. Networking with agencies like the **Indian Council for Child Welfare** ensures social rehabilitation.
