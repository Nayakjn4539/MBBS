# [[HEALTH INFORMATION & BASIC MEDICAL STATISTICS]] > Graphical representation of statistical data

### Graphical Representation of Statistical Data

The presentation of statistical data through charts, diagrams, and graphs is essential for visual comparison, analyzing trends, and simplifying complex data for easy understanding. The choice of the graph depends largely on the type of data: **Quantitative (Continuous)** or **Qualitative (Discrete/Categorical)**.

---

### I. Graphs for Quantitative (Continuous) Data
These are used for variables that are measurable and continuous (e.g., [[height]], [[weight]], [[blood pressure]], [[age]]).

#### 1. [[Histogram]]
*   **Description:** It is a graphical presentation of a frequency distribution. It consists of a series of blocks/rectangles.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   The **class intervals** are marked on the horizontal axis (X-axis) and **frequencies** on the vertical axis (Y-axis).
    *   There are **no gaps** between the rectangles (unlike bar charts) because the data is continuous.
    *   The **Area** of each rectangle is proportional to the frequency.
*   **Use:** To study the distribution of a variable (e.g., distribution of Hemoglobin levels in a population).
*   **> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> A graph with touching vertical bars of varying heights representing frequency distribution**,

#### 2. [[Frequency Polygon]]
*   **Description:** An area diagram developed over a histogram.
*   **Method:** It is obtained by joining the **mid-points** of the tops of the histogram blocks with straight lines.
*   **Use:** Useful when two or more frequency distributions need to be compared on the same graph (e.g., Blood pressure distribution in males vs. females).,

#### 3. [[Frequency Curve]]
*   **Description:** When the number of observations is very large and the class interval is reduced (small), the frequency polygon loses its angulation and becomes a smooth curve.
*   **Clinical Relevance:** The [[Normal Distribution Curve]] (Bell-shaped curve) is a classic example of a frequency curve used to define "normal" limits in medicine (Mean ± 2SD covers 95% of the population).,

#### 4. [[Line Diagram]] (Line Chart)
*   **Description:** A frequency polygon presenting variations by a line.
*   **Key Features:** It shows the **trend** of an event over a period of **time**.
*   **Use:** To show the rise and fall of disease cases over years (e.g., Malaria cases from 2010–2020, [[Infant Mortality Rate]] trends).
*   **> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> A line graph showing upward or downward trends over years**,

#### 5. [[Ogive]] (Cumulative Frequency Diagram)
*   **Description:** A graph of the **cumulative relative frequency** distribution.
*   **Key Features:** The curve is always rising.
*   **Use:** It is used to determine **partition values** like the [[Median]], [[Quartiles]], and [[Percentiles]] graphically.
*   **Clinical Relevance:** Growth charts (Road to Health charts) utilize percentile curves derived from Ogives to monitor child development.,

#### 6. [[Scatter Diagram]] (Dot Diagram)
*   **Description:** Used to depict the **correlation** (relationship) between two quantitative variables.
*   **Method:** One variable is plotted on the X-axis and the other on the Y-axis. The pattern of dots indicates the relationship.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   *Perfect Positive:* Straight line rising from left to right.
    *   *Perfect Negative:* Straight line falling from left to right.
    *   *No Correlation:* Random scatter of dots.
*   **Use:** Relationship between Height and Weight, or Calorie intake and Weight.,

### II. Diagrams for Qualitative (Discrete) Data
These are used for countable, non-measurable data (e.g., [[sex]], [[religion]], [[blood group]], [[causes of death]]).

#### 1. [[Bar Diagram]]
*   **Description:** Rectangular bars where the **length** of the bar corresponds to the frequency.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Bars are separated by **gaps** (space between bars should be roughly half the width of the bar).
    *   Can be vertical or horizontal.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Simple Bar Diagram:** Represents one variable (e.g., IMR of different countries).
    *   **Multiple Bar Diagram:** Compares two or more sets of data (e.g., Immunization status in different years).
    *   **Component (Proportional) Bar Diagram:** A single bar is divided into segments to show the composition (e.g., Causes of Infant Mortality).,

#### 2. [[Pie Chart]] (Sector Diagram)
*   **Description:** A circle divided into sectors (wedges) representing percentages of a total.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   The entire circle represents **100%** or **360 degrees**.
    *   The area of each sector is proportional to the frequency.
    *   Formula for angle: $\frac{\text{Class Frequency}}{\text{Total Frequency}} \times 360^\circ$.
*   **Use:** To show the composition of a whole (e.g., Distribution of ABO blood groups, Budget allocation in health).
*   **> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> A circle sliced into different colored sections representing percentages**,

#### 3. [[Pictogram]]
*   **Description:** Uses small pictures or symbols to represent data.
*   **Use:** Popular method for the general public (layman) who cannot understand complex charts.
*   **Example:** A picture of one doctor representing 1,000 population.,

#### 4. [[Map Diagram]] (Spot Map)
*   **Description:** Shows the geographical distribution of frequencies.
*   **Use:**
    *   To show local distribution of disease.
    *   To identify the **source of infection** (e.g., [[John Snow]]'s map of [[Cholera]] cases clustering around the Broad Street pump in London).,
