# [[PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IN OBSTETRICS, PAEDIATRICS AND GERIATRICS]] > Home based neonatal care is an essential intervention in preventing neonatal death

### Home Based Newborn Care (HBNC)

[[Home Based Newborn Care]] (HBNC) is a strategic intervention under the [[National Health Mission]] (NHM) aimed at reducing [[neonatal mortality]] and morbidity by providing essential care to newborns at the community level. It recognizes that a significant proportion of neonatal deaths occur in the first week of life and that many births still occur at home or involve early discharge from institutions.

#### **Rationale and Objectives**
The strategy complements institutional deliveries to ensure a continuum of care from the facility to the home. The primary objectives are:
1.  **Reduction of Mortality:** Specifically aiming to lower the [[Neonatal Mortality Rate]] (NNMR) and [[Infant Mortality Rate]] (IMR).
2.  **Early Detection:** Identification of [[Low Birth Weight]] (LBW) babies, [[preterm]] babies, and signs of [[sepsis]].
3.  **Promotion of Healthy Practices:** Encouraging exclusive [[breastfeeding]], thermal regulation, and hygiene.

#### **The Service Provider: [[ASHA]]**
The **Accredited Social Health Activist** ([[ASHA]]) is the key frontline worker responsible for HBNC. She is supported by the [[Anganwadi Worker]] (AWW) and [[ANM]].

**Incentive:** The ASHA receives an incentive of **Rs. 250** per newborn upon completion of the mandatory visits up to the 42nd day, provided the baby has been weighed, birth registered, and immunizations (BCG, OPV-0, Hep-B) recorded.

---

#### **Schedule of Home Visits**
The timing of visits is critical to capture complications during the most vulnerable periods.

| **Type of Delivery** | **Total Visits** | **Schedule of Visits (Days)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Home Delivery** | 7 Visits | Day **1**, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42 |
| **Institutional Delivery** | 6 Visits | Day 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42 |
| **Caesarean Section** | 5 Visits | Day 7, 14, 21, 28, 42 |

> **Note:** In case of institutional delivery, the mother usually stays for 48 hours; hence, the first home visit by ASHA is on Day 3. For C-sections, discharge is later, so visits start on Day 7.

*   **Mnemonic for Schedule:**
    *   **"The Rule of First Week + Multiples of 7"**
    *   **First Week:** 1, 3, 7 (Critical window)
    *   **The Rest:** 14, 21, 28, 42 (Weekly/Bi-weekly intervals)

#### **Key Interventions Performed by ASHA**
During home visits, the ASHA performs the following essential tasks:

1.  **Examination and Monitoring:**
    *   **Weighing:** Recording birth weight to identify [[Low Birth Weight]] (<2.5 kg).
    *   **Temperature:** Measuring temperature to detect [[hypothermia]] or fever.
    *   **Physical Check:** Checking for danger signs (convulsions, chest indrawing, refusal to feed).

2.  **Essential Care Provision:**
    *   **Warmth:** Promoting **[[Kangaroo Mother Care]] (KMC)** for LBW babies and skin-to-skin contact to prevent hypothermia.
    *   **Feeding:** Supporting early initiation (within 1 hour) and **[[Exclusive Breastfeeding]]** for 6 months.
    *   **Cord Care:** Ensuring the cord is kept clean and dry (No application of cow dung/oil).
    *   **Eye Care:** Checking for discharge/infection.

3.  **Sepsis Management:**
    *   Identification of signs of [[neonatal sepsis]].
    *   **Referral:** Immediate referral to the appropriate facility ([[SNCU]]/[[NBSU]]).
    *   **Pre-referral Treatment:** If referral is difficult/delayed, [[ANM]] is empowered to administer pre-referral antibiotics (Injection **Gentamicin** and oral **Amoxicillin**) as per [[IMNCI]] guidelines.

#### **Management of High-Risk Newborns**
Special protocols apply to "At-Risk" babies (Preterm or <2.5 kg):
*   **Increased Frequency:** More frequent home visits by ASHA.
*   **Intensive Monitoring:** Strict monitoring of weight gain and feeding.
*   **Additional Incentive:** ASHA receives an extra incentive (Rs. 50) for monthly follow-up of LBW babies and SNCU-discharged babies.

---

#### **Home-Based Care for Young Child (HBYC)**
HBNC has been extended as **[[HBYC]]** to ensure continued survival and development.
*   **Additional Visits:** 5 visits by ASHA at months **3, 6, 9, 12, and 15**.
*   **Focus:** Nutrition (complementary feeding), growth monitoring, and early childhood development.

#### **Clinical Relevance**
*   **[[Hypothermia]] ("The Silent Killer"):** ASHA must educate the mother that a baby’s feet should be pink and warm. Cold feet indicate thermal stress requiring immediate KMC.
*   **Danger Signs:** ASHA uses the "7 Danger Signs" of [[IMNCI]] (e.g., stopped feeding well, convulsions, fast breathing >60/min, severe chest indrawing) to determine the need for urgent referral.
