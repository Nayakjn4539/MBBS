# [[Neck Surgery]] > Bronchoscopy

### Bronchoscopy

[[Bronchoscopy]] is an endoscopic technique of visualizing the inside of the airway for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. It involves the insertion of a bronchoscope into the airways, usually through the nose or mouth, or occasionally through a tracheostomy.

#### Applied Anatomy of the Tracheobronchial Tree

Understanding the anatomy is crucial for navigation and identifying pathology.

*   **[[Trachea]]:**
    *   A membrano-cartilaginous tube extending from the lower border of the [[Cricoid cartilage]] (C6) to the [[Carina]] (T5).
    *   Length: 10–12 cm in adults.
    *   Structure: 16–20 incomplete hyaline cartilage rings (C-shaped), deficient posteriorly (membranous wall adjacent to the esophagus),.
*   **Bronchi Differences:**
    *   **Right Main Bronchus:** Shorter (2.5 cm), wider, and more vertical (in line with the trachea). *Clinical Implication:* [[Foreign body]] aspiration is more common on the right side,.
    *   **Left Main Bronchus:** Longer (5 cm), narrower, and more angular.
*   **[[Bronchopulmonary Segments]]:**
    *   Right Lung: 10 segments (3 Upper, 2 Middle, 5 Lower).
    *   Left Lung: 9 segments (some sources say 8-10 depending on fusion) (Upper lobe includes lingula).

#### Types of Bronchoscopy

There are two primary types: **Rigid** and **Flexible Fiberoptic**.

| Feature | [[Rigid Bronchoscopy]] | [[Flexible Bronchoscopy]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Anesthesia** | General Anesthesia (usually required) | Topical/Local (sedation optional) |
| **Route** | Trans-oral only | Trans-nasal, Trans-oral, or via ET tube |
| **Ventilation** | Through side ports/vents or jet ventilation | Patient breathes spontaneously or via adapter |
| **Visualization** | Direct line of sight (telescopes add magnification) | Distal chip/fiberoptics (can see sub-segments) |
| **Foreign Body** | **Superior** (Best for removal) | Limited (only small objects) |
| **Biopsy** | Larger specimens possible | Small crush biopsies |
| **Head Position** | Requires neck extension (Rose/Barking dog) | Neutral or semi-recumbent |
| **Main Use** | Therapeutic (FB removal, massive bleed) | Diagnostic, bedside procedures |

**Note on Rigid Scopes:**
*   **Jackson Type:** Distal illumination.
*   **Negus Type:** Proximal illumination (brighter, less fogging).

#### Indications

**1. Diagnostic Indications**,,
*   Unexplained chronic cough or wheeze (localized).
*   [[Hemoptysis]] (to localize bleeding site).
*   Abnormal chest X-ray (atelectasis, unresolved pneumonia, shadows).
*   Suspected [[Lung cancer]] (tissue biopsy, washing).
*   Stridor.
*   Vocal cord palsy (to rule out mediastinal malignancy).
*   Collection of secretions for culture (TB, fungus).

**2. Therapeutic Indications**,,
*   **Removal of Foreign Bodies** (Rigid is the gold standard).
*   Aspiration of thick, retained secretions (mucus plugs) causing atelectasis.
*   Dilatation of tracheal/bronchial stenosis.
*   [[Stenting]] of the airway.
*   Laser ablation of tumors (e.g., papillomas).

---

#### Contraindications

*   **Absolute:** Inability to oxygenate the patient adequately.
*   **Relative:**
    *   Severe coagulopathy or bleeding diathesis.
    *   Cervical spine injury/anomalies (specifically for Rigid bronchoscopy due to neck extension requirements).
    *   Aortic aneurysm (risk of rupture).
    *   Recent myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
    *   Severe obstruction of the Superior Vena Cava.

---

#### Procedure: Rigid Bronchoscopy

**1. Pre-operative:**
*   NPO (Nil Per Os) for 6 hours.
*   Check neck extension ability.
*   Selection of bronchoscope size is critical (e.g., 3.5-4.0 mm for infants, 8.5 mm for adult males).

**2. Positioning:**
*   **[[Boyce Position]]** (also called "Barking Dog" or "Sniffing the Morning Air" position).
*   Flexion of the cervical spine and extension at the atlanto-occipital joint,.

**3. Anesthesia:**
*   General anesthesia. Muscle relaxants are used to prevent laryngospasm. Ventilation is maintained via the side port of the bronchoscope or jet ventilation.

**4. Technique Steps**,:
1.  **Protection:** Gauze/dental guard placed on upper teeth.
2.  **Introduction:** Scope held in right hand (pen-grip). Left hand retracts lips/protects teeth. Introduced via right side of mouth.
3.  **Visualization:** Advance to identify the [[Epiglottis]].
4.  **Elevation:** Lift the epiglottis to expose the glottis.
5.  **Rotation:** Rotate the scope **90 degrees** clockwise so the beveled tip aligns with the vocal cords to pass atraumatically.
6.  **Navigation:** Once in the trachea, rotate back.
    *   To enter **Right Bronchus**: Flex head to the *left*.
    *   To enter **Left Bronchus**: Flex head to the *right*.

**5. Clinical Implication:**
*   **Jackson's Dictum:** "All is not asthma that wheezes." In suspected foreign body cases, failure to perform bronchoscopy is more disastrous than the complications of the procedure itself.

#### Procedure: Flexible Fiberoptic Bronchoscopy

*   Usually performed under local anesthesia (Lignocaine spray/nebulization).
*   Can be done bedside (ICU settings).
*   **Technique:** Passed trans-nasally (most common) or trans-orally (with bite block).
*   Navigates through: Nose $\rightarrow$ Nasopharynx $\rightarrow$ Oropharynx $\rightarrow$ Larynx $\rightarrow$ Trachea.
*   Allows visualization of segmental and sub-segmental bronchi which rigid scopes cannot reach.

---

#### Foreign Bodies in Airway

*   **Epidemiology:** Most common in children < 4 years. Most common FB: Peanuts/Seeds (vegetative FBs are dangerous as they swell and cause chemical bronchitis).
*   **Site:** Right bronchus is the most common site due to anatomy.
*   **Radiological Signs:**
    *   **Obstructive Emphysema:** FB acts as a ball-valve (air enters but cannot exit) $\rightarrow$ Hyperinflation on affected side.
    *   **Atelectasis:** Complete obstruction (stop-valve) $\rightarrow$ Lung collapse.
*   **Management:** Removal via **Rigid Bronchoscopy** using optical forceps or Dormia basket.

---

#### Complications

**Immediate**,:
*   **Hypoxia/Arrhythmias:** Vagal stimulation or airway obstruction.
*   **Laryngospasm:** Common in children or light anesthesia.
*   **Hemorrhage:** From biopsy site or trauma.
*   **Dental Trauma:** Injury to upper incisors during rigid bronchoscopy.
*   **Trauma:** Perforation of the trachea or bronchus leading to [[Pneumothorax]] or Pneumomediastinum.

**Delayed:**
*   **Laryngeal Edema:** Causing post-operative stridor (manage with humidification, steroids like Dexamethasone).
*   Infection (Pneumonia).
