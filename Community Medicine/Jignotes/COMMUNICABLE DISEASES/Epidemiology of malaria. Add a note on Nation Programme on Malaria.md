# Epidemiology of Malaria

Malaria is a protozoal disease caused by infection with parasites of the genus [[Plasmodium]] and transmitted to man by certain species of infected female [[Anopheles mosquito]]. It remains a major public health problem in India, characterized by fever with paroxysms.

## Epidemiological Determinants (The Triad)

### 1. Agent Factors
*   **Agent:** The causative agents are intracellular protozoa. Four species infect humans naturally:
    *   ***P. vivax***: Most widespread; causes benign tertian malaria. Relapses occur due to hypnozoites (dormant liver stage).
    *   ***P. falciparum***: Most serious/fatal; causes malignant tertian malaria; prevalent in tribal/forest areas.
    *   ***P. malariae***: Causes quartan malaria; associated with recrudescence.
    *   ***P. ovale***: Rare in India.
    *   ***P. knowlesi***: Zoonotic malaria (rare in India, common in SE Asia).
*   **Life Cycle:**
    *   **Intermediate Host:** Man (Asexual cycle/Schizogony).
    *   **Definitive Host:** Female Anopheles mosquito (Sexual cycle/Sporogony).

### 2. Host Factors
*   **Age:** All ages are susceptible. Infants and young children are at higher risk.
*   **Gender:** Males are more frequently affected due to greater outdoor exposure (occupational).
*   **Pregnancy:** Increases risk of severe malaria, abortion, and low birth weight. Primigravida are at greatest risk.
*   **Immunity:** Acquired immunity develops after repeated exposure. Infants of immune mothers are protected for 3–5 months by maternal IgG.
*   **Genetic Traits:** Sickle cell trait (HbS) offers protection against severe *P. falciparum*. Duffy-negative RBCs are resistant to *P. vivax*.

### 3. Environmental Factors
*   **Season:** Maximum prevalence in India is from **July to November** (monsoon and post-monsoon).
*   **Temperature & Humidity:** Optimal temp: 20°C–30°C; Humidity: 60%.
*   **Vectors in India:**
    *   ***An. culicifacies***: Main vector of **Rural** malaria (Zoophilic).
    *   ***An. stephensi***: Main vector of **Urban** malaria (Breeds in overhead tanks, wells).
    *   ***An. fluviatilis***: Vector in **Hilly/Foothill** areas (Highly anthropophilic).

> **Mnemonic for Vectors:**
> *   **C**ulicifacies = **C**ountryside (Rural)
> *   **S**tephensi = **C**ity (Urban) / **S**tep-wells
> *   **F**luviatilis = **F**oothills

## Modes of Transmission
1.  **Vector Transmission:** Bite of infected female Anopheles mosquito (Infective stage: **Sporozoites**).
2.  **Direct Transmission:** Blood transfusion, contaminated needles/syringes ("Trophozoite induced malaria" - no liver stage, so no relapse).
3.  **Congenital Malaria:** From infected mother to newborn (rare).

## Incubation Period
| Species | Incubation Period (Days) |
| :--- | :--- |
| *P. falciparum* | 12 (Range 9–14) |
| *P. vivax* | 14 (Range 8–17) |
| *P. malariae* | 28 (Range 18–40) |
| *P. ovale* | 17 (Range 16–18) |

## Malaria Indicators (Metrics)
Epidemiological assessment relies on specific indices:
*   **[[Annual Parasite Incidence]] (API):** (Confirmed cases ÷ Population) × 1000. It is the sophisticated measure of incidence. **Target for elimination is API < 1**.
*   **[[Annual Blood Examination Rate]] (ABER):** Index of operational efficiency. Target should be **>10%** of the population.
*   **[[Slide Positivity Rate]] (SPR):** Percentage of slides found positive. High SPR indicates an outbreak trend.
*   **Infant Parasite Rate (IPR):** Most sensitive index of *recent transmission* in a locality. Zero IFR for 3 consecutive years suggests absence of transmission.

# National Programme on Malaria

Currently, malaria control activities in India are under the umbrella of the **[[National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme]] (NVBDCP)**.

### Evolution of the Programme
*   **1953:** National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP).
*   **1958:** National Malaria Eradication Programme (NMEP).
*   **1977:** **[[Modified Plan of Operation]] (MPO)** (Shifted from eradication to control due to resurgence).
*   **1999:** National Anti-Malaria Programme (NAMP).
*   **2002:** Integrated into **NVBDCP**.

### Goal and Vision
The vision has shifted from control to **Elimination**.
*   **Goal:** Eliminate malaria (Zero indigenous cases) throughout India by **2030**.
*   **Framework:** **[[National Framework for Malaria Elimination]] (NFME) 2016–2030**.

### Classification of States for Elimination
Under NFME, states are categorized based on API:
1.  **Category 0 (Prevention of re-establishment):** Zero indigenous cases.
2.  **Category 1 (Elimination phase):** API < 1 per 1000 (all districts < 1).
3.  **Category 2 (Pre-elimination phase):** API < 1 per 1000 (some districts > 1).
4.  **Category 3 (Intensified control phase):** API > 1 per 1000.

### Key Strategies

#### 1. Early Diagnosis and Complete Treatment (EDPT)
*   **Diagnosis:** Microscopy (Gold Standard) or **[[Rapid Diagnostic Tests]] (RDTs)** (Bivalent for *Pv* and *Pf*).
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **P. vivax:** Chloroquine (3 days) + Primaquine (14 days) (to prevent relapse). *Caution: Primaquine is contraindicated in pregnancy and G6PD deficiency*.
    *   **P. falciparum:** **[[Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy]] (ACT)** (Artesunate + Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine or AL) + Single dose Primaquine (to kill gametocytes).

#### 2. Integrated Vector Management (IVM)
*   **Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS):** DDT, Malathion, or Synthetic Pyrethroids (in areas with API > 2).
*   **[[Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets]] (LLINs):** Promotion of bed nets treated with insecticide.
*   **Biological Control:** Use of Larvivorous fish like *Gambusia* and *Poecilia* (Guppy).
*   **Chemical Larvicides:** Temephos (Abate) in potable water.

#### 3. Surveillance and Epidemic Response
*   **Active Surveillance:** Health workers visit houses fortnightly to detect fever cases.
*   **Passive Surveillance:** Patients reporting to health facilities (PHC, hospitals).
*   **Sentinel Surveillance:** Hospital-based tracking of severe cases and deaths.

#### 4. Supportive Interventions
*   **BCC (Behavior Change Communication):** Awareness about bed nets and seeking treatment.
*   **Urban Malaria Scheme:** Focuses on anti-larval measures and legislative control (bylaws) to prevent breeding in construction sites/tanks.

### Clinical Relevance
**Cerebral Malaria:** A severe complication of *P. falciparum* infection characterized by unarousable coma, convulsions, and neurological signs. It is a medical emergency requiring parenteral Artemisinin derivatives.
