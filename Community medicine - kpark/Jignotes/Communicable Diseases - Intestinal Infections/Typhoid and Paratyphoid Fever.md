# Typhoid and Paratyphoid Fever (Enteric Fever)

**Enteric fever** refers to a systemic infection caused by *Salmonella typhi* (Typhoid) or *Salmonella paratyphi* A, B, or C (Paratyphoid). It is an acute infectious disease characterized by continuous fever, involvement of lymphoid tissues, and constitutional symptoms.

### 1. Epidemiological Determinants

**Agent Factors**
*   **Causative Agent:**
    *   **Typhoid:** Caused by *Salmonella typhi* (S. typhi).
    *   **Paratyphoid:** Caused by *Salmonella paratyphi* A, B, or C. (Paratyphoid B is common in Europe; A is common in India).
*   **Characteristics:** Gram-negative, non-spore-forming bacilli.
*   **Antigens:**
    *   **O Antigen:** Somatic (Body) antigen.
    *   **H Antigen:** Flagellar antigen.
    *   **Vi Antigen:** Virulence antigen (associated with [[capsular polysaccharide]]).
*   **Resistance:** The bacilli can survive in ice and ice cream for over a month and in sewage/water for weeks. It is killed by boiling or chlorination.

**Reservoir of Infection**
*   **Natural Host:** [[Man]] is the only known reservoir. There is **no animal reservoir** for *S. typhi*.
*   **Source:** Feces and urine of cases and carriers.
*   **Carriers:** More dangerous than cases for spreading infection.
    1.  **Incubatory Carriers:** Shed bacilli during the incubation period.
    2.  **Convalescent Carriers:** Shed bacilli for 2–8 weeks after recovery.
    3.  **Chronic Carriers:** Excrete bacilli for **>1 year** after the attack. The organism hides in the [[gallbladder]] (fecal carriers) or urinary tract (urinary carriers).
    *   *Clinical Relevance:* "Typhoid Mary" (Mary Mallon) was a famous cook and chronic carrier responsible for multiple outbreaks.

### 2. Transmission
*   **Route:** **Fecal-oral** or urine-oral route.
*   **Modes:**
    *   Ingestion of contaminated **water** and **food** (e.g., milk, vegetables grown in sewage farms).
    *   Direct contact with soiled hands.
*   **The 5 F's of Transmission:**
    1.  **F**lies
    2.  **F**ingers
    3.  **F**eces
    4.  **F**ood
    5.  **F**luids

### 3. Incubation Period
*   **Typhoid:** Usually **10–14 days** (Range: 3 days to 3 weeks).
*   **Paratyphoid:** 1–10 days (usually shorter).
*   *Note:* It is dose-dependent; higher inoculum leads to a shorter incubation period.

### 4. Clinical Picture
The disease typically follows a 4-week course if untreated. Paratyphoid is clinically similar but generally milder.

*   **First Week:**
    *   Step-ladder pyrexia (gradual rise in temperature).
    *   Headache, malaise, coated tongue.
    *   Relative **[[bradycardia]]** (Pulse is slower than expected for the fever).
*   **Second Week:**
    *   Fever reaches a plateau (continuous high fever).
    *   Abdominal distension and tenderness.
    *   **[[Splenomegaly]]**.
    *   **Rose Spots:** Pink papules on the trunk (fade on pressure).
    *   "Pea-soup" diarrhea (greenish liquid stool) may occur.
*   **Third Week (Complications):**
    *   **[[Intestinal hemorrhage]]** (Sudden drop in BP).
    *   **Intestinal perforation** (Severe abdominal pain, peritonitis).
*   **Fourth Week:** Convalescence or progression to coma/death if untreated.

### 5. Diagnosis
The choice of investigation depends on the duration of fever.

**Mnemonic for Diagnosis: BASU**
*   **B**lood Culture: **1st Week** (Most specific/Mainstay).
*   **A**gglutination (Widal Test): **2nd Week** (Detects antibodies against O and H antigens).
*   **S**tool Culture: **3rd Week**.
*   **U**rine Culture: **4th Week**.

*   *Note on Widal Test:* A rising titre (four-fold increase) in paired sera is more significant than a single test. False positives are common (e.g., in Malaria).
*   **Newer Tests:** **[[TyphiDot]]** (Detects IgM/IgG), IDL Tubex.

### 6. Treatment
*   **Antibiotics:**
    *   **Drug of Choice:** **Fluoroquinolones** (Ciprofloxacin/Levofloxacin) or **3rd Gen Cephalosporins** (Ceftriaxone/Cefixime) are widely used due to resistance.
    *   *Historical:* Chloramphenicol (Associated with bone marrow depression/aplastic anemia).
    *   *MDR Typhoid:* Resistant to Ampicillin, Chloramphenicol, and Co-trimoxazole.
*   **Carrier Treatment:** Ampicillin/Amoxicillin + Probenecid for 6 weeks.
*   **Surgery:** **[[Cholecystectomy]]** may be required for chronic carriers with gallstones to eradicate the carrier state.

### 7. Prevention and Control

**A. Sanitation and Hygiene (The 5 Barrier approach)**
*   Purification of community water supplies.
*   Sanitary disposal of human excreta.
*   Food hygiene and pasteurization of milk.
*   Control of flies.
*   Hand washing (Personal hygiene).

**B. Vaccination**
Currently, three types of vaccines are relevant:
1.  **Vi Polysaccharide Vaccine (Typhim Vi):**
    *   **Type:** Subunit vaccine.
    *   **Route:** Intramuscular (IM).
    *   **Dose:** Single dose.
    *   **Protection:** ~3 years.
2.  **Ty21a Vaccine (Typhoral):**
    *   **Type:** Live attenuated oral vaccine (Capsules).
    *   **Schedule:** Days 1, 3, and 5 (Alternate days).
    *   **Protection:** ~3 years.
3.  **Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine (TCV):** (e.g., Typbar-TCV)
    *   Can be given to infants (>6 months). Longer immunity.

**C. Control of Carriers**
*   Identification via stool cultures.
*   Food handlers must be screened; carriers should **not** engage in food preparation until cured.
