# Anatomy of Eyelids and Appendages

### Gross Anatomy of Eyelids
The eyelids are mobile tissue curtains protecting the eyeballs. When open, the upper lid covers about one-sixth of the cornea (approx. 2 mm), while the lower lid just touches the limbus.

**Parts of the Eyelid:**
*   **External Surface:** Covered by skin.
*   **Internal Surface:** Lined by [[Palpebral conjunctiva]].
*   **Palpebral Aperture:** The elliptical space between open lids. Dimensions: 10–11 mm vertically and 28–30 mm horizontally.
*   **Canthi:** The angles where lids meet.
    *   **Medial Canthus:** Rounded.
    *   **Lateral Canthus:** Acute angle; situated about 2 mm higher than the medial canthus.

**Lid Margin Anatomy:**
The free margin is about 2 mm broad and divided by the [[Lacrimal punctum]] into two parts:
1.  **Lacrimal Portion (Medial):** Rounded, devoid of lashes.
2.  **Ciliary Portion (Lateral):** Contains lashes and glands. It has a rounded anterior border and sharp posterior border.

**Structures of the Intermarginal Strip:**
The strip between the anterior and posterior borders of the lid margin is divided by the **Grey Line** (junction of skin and conjunctiva).
*   **Anterior to Grey Line:** 2–3 rows of [[Eyelashes]] (Cilia).
*   **Posterior to Grey Line:** Openings of [[Meibomian glands]] arranged in a row.

> **Clinical Implication:** The **Grey Line** is a crucial surgical landmark. During lid surgery, splitting of the eyelid into anterior and posterior lamellae is done at this level,.

### Microscopic Structure of Eyelids
From anterior to posterior, the eyelid consists of the following layers:

#### 1. Skin
*   Thinnest skin in the body,.
*   Elastic and fine-textured.

#### 2. Subcutaneous Areolar Tissue
*   Loose connective tissue containing **NO fat**.
*   **Clinical Implication:** Being very loose and fat-free, it is readily distended by edema fluid (e.g., in renal failure) or blood (e.g., "Black eye" after trauma).

#### 3. Layer of Striated Muscles
| Muscle | Location | Nerve Supply | Function | Clinical Palsy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Orbicularis Oculi]]** | Concentric sheet. Divided into Orbital, Preseptal, and Pretarsal parts. | Facial Nerve (CN VII) | Closure of eyelids (Blinking/forced closure) | [[Lagophthalmos]] (Inability to close eye) |
| **[[Levator Palpebral Superioris]] (LPS)** | Upper lid only. Arises from orbital apex. | Oculomotor Nerve (CN III) | Elevation of upper lid | [[Ptosis]] (Drooping of lid) |

#### 4. Submuscular Areolar Tissue
*   Layer of loose connective tissue.
*   Contains the main nerves and blood vessels of the lids.
*   **Clinical Implication:** This is the plane where local anesthetic injections are infiltrated for lid surgery.

#### 5. Fibrous Layer
This forms the framework of the lids.
*   **[[Tarsal Plate]] (Tarsus):** 
    *   Dense connective tissue plates (not cartilage) giving shape and firmness,.
    *   Upper tarsus is larger than lower tarsus.
    *   Contains Meibomian glands embedded within the stroma.
    *   Medial and lateral ends attach to orbital margins via palpebral ligaments.
*   **[[Septum Orbitale]] (Palpebral Fascia):**
    *   Thin membrane attached centrally to tarsal plates and peripherally to the orbital rim periosteum.
    *   Perforated by nerves, vessels, and LPS muscle.
    *   Acts as a barrier between the eyelid and orbital contents (distinguishes pre-septal vs. orbital cellulitis).

#### 6. Layer of Non-Striated Muscle ([[Muller's Muscle]])
*   **Upper Lid:** Arises from LPS fibers.
*   **Lower Lid:** Arises from Inferior Rectus prolongation.
*   **Nerve Supply:** **Sympathetic fibers**.
*   **Clinical Implication:** Paralysis leads to mild ptosis and "apparent" enophthalmos, seen in [[Horner's Syndrome]],.

#### 7. Conjunctiva
*   Specifically, the **Palpebral Conjunctiva**.
*   Lines the posterior surface of the lids. Consists of marginal, tarsal, and orbital parts.

### Glands of the Eyelids

| Gland | Type | Location | Secretion | Inflammation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Meibomian Glands]]** (Tarsal) | Modified **Sebaceous** | Embedded vertically in Tarsal Plate. ~30-40 in upper lid, 20-30 in lower. | Lipid layer of [[Tear film]] (prevents evaporation) | Chronic: [[Chalazion]]<br>Acute: [[Hordeolum Internum]] |
| **[[Glands of Zeis]]** | Modified **Sebaceous** | Associated with eyelash follicles. | Sebum (oily) to lashes | Acute: [[Stye]] (Hordeolum Externum) |
| **[[Glands of Moll]]** | Modified **Sweat** | Near hair follicles; open into follicles or Zeis ducts. | Sweat | Cyst formation |
| **[[Glands of Wolfring]]** | Accessory Lacrimal | Near upper border of tarsal plate. | Aqueous part of tears | - |
| **[[Glands of Krause]]** | Accessory Lacrimal | In the fornices. | Aqueous part of tears | - |

### Blood Supply and Drainage

#### Arterial Supply
Derived from the Ophthalmic artery and Lacrimal artery. They form arcades:
*   **Marginal Arterial Arcade:** Lies in submuscular plane, 2 mm from lid margin (upper) and 4 mm (lower).
*   **Peripheral/Superior Arterial Arcade:** Lies near the upper border of the tarsal plate (upper lid only).

#### Venous Drainage
Arranged in two plexuses:
1.  **Pre-tarsal:** Drains into subcutaneous veins.
2.  **Post-tarsal:** Drains into orbital/ophthalmic veins.

#### Lymphatic Drainage
This is crucial for determining the spread of infections or malignancies,,:
*   **Lateral side (Lateral 2/3 of upper lid & Lateral 1/3 of lower lid):** Drains to **[[Preauricular Lymph Nodes]]**.
*   **Medial side (Medial 1/3 of upper lid & Medial 2/3 of lower lid):** Drains to **[[Submandibular Lymph Nodes]]**.

### Nerve Supply

1.  **Motor Supply:**
    *   **CN III (Oculomotor):** Supplies Levator Palpebral Superioris (LPS).
    *   **CN VII (Facial):** Supplies Orbicularis Oculi.
    *   **Sympathetic Fibers:** Supply Muller’s muscle.

2.  **Sensory Supply:**
    *   Derived from **Trigeminal Nerve (CN V)** branches:
        *   **Upper Lid:** Lacrimal, Supraorbital, Supratrochlear nerves (Ophthalmic division V1).
        *   **Lower Lid:** Infraorbital nerve (Maxillary division V2) and Infratrochlear nerve.

### Appendages of the Eyelids

*   **Eyelashes (Cilia):**
    *   Arranged in 2–3 rows at the anterior lid margin.
    *   Roots are supplied by vascular plexuses and nerves.
    *   Associated with Glands of Zeis and Moll.
    *   **Lifespan:** Falls out every 3–5 months and is replaced.
    *   **Pathologies:**
        *   **[[Trichiasis]]:** Inward misdirection of cilia rubbing the cornea.
        *   **[[Distichiasis]]:** Extra posterior row of lashes (metaplasia of Meibomian glands).
        *   **[[Madarosis]]:** Loss of eyelashes (seen in blepharitis, leprosy).
        *   **[[Poliosis]]:** Whitening of eyelashes.
