# [[HEALTH PLANNING & MANAGEMENT]] > Prioritization is an important prerequisite health planning

### Prioritization in Health Planning

**Prioritization** is the process of ranking health problems or needs in order of urgency or importance to determine which issues should be addressed first. It is a critical step in the [[Health Planning Cycle]], situated between the assessment of resources and the formulation of the plan.

#### Why is Prioritization Essential? (The Rationale)
The fundamental need for prioritization arises from the economic concept of **Scarcity**.
*   **Limited Resources:** Every nation, regardless of wealth, has finite resources in terms of **Manpower**, **Money**, **Materials**, Skills, and Time.
*   **Unlimited Needs:** Health needs and demands of the community always exceed the available resources.
*   **Efficiency:** It ensures that resources are not wasted on low-impact activities and are directed toward areas where they yield the maximum health benefit.

> **Clinical Relevance:** Just as a doctor performs **Triage** in an emergency room to treat the most critical patients first, a health administrator must prioritize programs (e.g., [[Immunization]] over cosmetic surgery) to save the maximum number of lives with the available budget.

#### Criteria for Fixing Priorities
When selecting which health problems to tackle, planners consider the following factors:

1.  **Magnitude of the Problem:** The prevalence or incidence of the disease. Common diseases affecting a large population are prioritized over rare ones.
2.  **Severity:** The impact on [[Mortality]] (death rates) and Morbidity (disability/illness).
3.  **Feasibility (Treatability):** Whether the disease can be prevented or controlled with existing technology and available resources.
4.  **Cost-Effectiveness:** Interventions that provide the greatest health outcome for the lowest cost are preferred.
5.  **Vulnerability:** Focus on "at-risk" groups like mothers, children, and the elderly.
6.  **Community Concern:** The "felt needs" of the people and political pressures play a significant role. A program is more likely to succeed if the community perceives it as a priority.
7.  **Social Investment:** Saving the lives of younger people (who contribute to the economy) is often prioritized over diseases affecting only the very old.

*   **F**easibility (Technical and financial)
*   **C**ost-effectiveness
*   **C**ommunity Concern/Political Will

#### Tools for Prioritization
Quantitative management techniques are often used to assist in this process:
*   **[[Cost-Benefit Analysis]] (CBA):** Compares the economic cost of a program with the economic benefits (expressed in monetary terms). However, it is hard to put a monetary value on human life.
*   **[[Cost-Effectiveness Analysis]] (CEA):** Compares cost against health outcomes (e.g., life years gained, cases prevented) rather than money. This is more useful in the health sector.

#### The Planning Cycle Context
Prioritization is **Step 4** in the Health Planning Cycle:
1.  Analysis of health situation.
2.  Establishment of objectives/goals.
3.  Assessment of resources.
4.  **Fixing Priorities.**
5.  Write-up of formulated plan.
6.  Programming and implementation.
7.  Monitoring.
8.  Evaluation.
