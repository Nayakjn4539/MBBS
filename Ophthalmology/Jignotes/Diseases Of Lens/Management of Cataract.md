# [[Diseases Of Lens]] > Management of Cataract

# Management of Cataract

[[Cataract]] is the opacification of the crystalline lens or its capsule. The management is primarily surgical, involving the removal of the opacified lens and replacement with an artificial [[Intraocular Lens]] (IOL).

### 1. Pre-operative Evaluation
Before surgery, a comprehensive assessment is mandatory to determine the prognosis, select the surgical technique, and calculate the IOL power.

#### A. Ocular Examination
*   **Visual Acuity:** Recorded for distance and near, with and without pinhole to assess potential vision.
*   **Slit Lamp Biomicroscopy:** To assess:
    *   Morphology and depth of cataract.
    *   Status of the cornea (e.g., guttata in [[Fuchs' Endothelial Dystrophy]]).
    *   Anterior chamber depth and cellular reaction (uveitis).
*   **Intraocular Pressure (IOP):** To rule out [[Glaucoma]] or ocular hypertension.
*   **Regurgitation Test:** To rule out chronic [[Dacryocystitis]] (infection source).
*   **Fundus Examination:** To rule out posterior segment pathologies (e.g., [[Diabetic Retinopathy]], [[ARMD]], Optic Atrophy).
    *   If the cataract is dense (media hazy), perform **B-Scan Ultrasonography** to rule out [[Retinal Detachment]] or tumors.
*   **Retinal Function Tests:** Specifically for dense cataracts:
    *   Perception of Light (PL).
    *   Projection of Rays (PR) to test peripheral retinal function.
    *   [[Maddox Rod Test]] or Two-light discrimination test for macular function.
    *   **Laser Interferometry** or **Potential Acuity Meter (PAM)**: To predict post-op visual potential.

#### B. Systemic Examination
*   Screening for **Diabetes Mellitus** (risk of infection/hemorrhage), **Hypertension** (risk of expulsive hemorrhage), and cardiac/respiratory disorders.
*   Review of medications (e.g., Alpha-blockers for BPH cause [[Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome]]).

#### C. Biometry (IOL Power Calculation)
The process of calculating the power of the IOL is called [[Biometry]].
1.  **Keratometry (K):** Measures corneal curvature.
2.  **Axial Length (L):** Measured by **A-scan Ultrasound** or Optical Biometry (e.g., IOL Master). Normal axial length is approx. 24mm.
3.  **Formula:** The SRK Formula (Sanders-Retzlaff-Kraff) is commonly used:
    $$P = A - 2.5L - 0.9K$$
    *   **P** = Power of IOL in Diopters.
    *   **A** = Constant specific to the IOL type.
    *   **L** = Axial Length in mm.
    *   **K** = Average Keratometry in Diopters.

### 2. Indications for Surgery
Medical management (e.g., potassium iodide drops) has no proven efficacy in curing cataracts. Surgery is the only definitive treatment.

1.  **Visual Improvement:** When visual acuity reduction hinders daily activities or profession.
2.  **Medical Indications:**
    *   [[Phacomorphic Glaucoma]] (Intumescent cataract inducing angle closure).
    *   [[Phacolytic Glaucoma]] (Lens protein leakage).
    *   [[Phacoanaphylactic Uveitis]].
    *   To allow view of fundus for managing [[Diabetic Retinopathy]].
3.  **Cosmetic:** To obtain a black pupil in a blind eye (e.g., mature cataract with optic atrophy).

### 3. Surgical Techniques

#### A. Intracapsular Cataract Extraction (ICCE)
*   **Procedure:** Removal of the entire lens *with* its capsule.
*   **Current Status:** Obsolete for routine cataracts.
*   **Indications:** Subluxated/dislocated lens where zonules are broken.
*   **Disadvantages:** Large incision, high astigmatism, loss of posterior capsule support (cannot use PCIOL), higher risk of vitreous loss, [[Cystoid Macular Edema]], and [[Retinal Detachment]].

#### B. Extracapsular Cataract Extraction (ECCE) - Conventional
*   **Procedure:** Anterior capsule is opened (capsulotomy), nucleus expressed, and cortex aspirated. The posterior capsule is left intact.
*   **Advantages:** Supports [[Posterior Chamber IOL]] (PCIOL), reduced risk of vitreous-related complications compared to ICCE.
*   **Disadvantages:** Large incision (10-12mm), requires sutures, higher post-op astigmatism, slower visual rehabilitation.

#### C. Manual Small Incision Cataract Surgery (SICS)
*   **Technique:** A self-sealing sclero-corneal tunnel is created.
*   **Incision Size:** 5.5 - 7 mm (Scleral tunnel).
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Scleral tunnel incision.
    2.  Continuous Curvilinear Capsulorhexis (CCC).
    3.  Hydrodissection.
    4.  Nucleus prolapse into AC and delivery (visco-expression).
    5.  Implantation of rigid PMMA IOL.
    6.  No sutures required (Self-sealing valve effect).
*   **Advantages:** Low cost, no machine dependence, suitable for very hard cataracts, less astigmatism than conventional ECCE.

#### D. Phacoemulsification (Phaco) - Gold Standard
*   **Principle:** A titanium needle vibrates at ultrasonic speed (Piezoelectric crystal) to emulsify the nucleus, which is aspirated.
*   **Incision Size:** 1.8mm – 3.2mm (Clear corneal incision).
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Side port incision:** For instruments.
    2.  **Continuous Curvilinear Capsulorhexis (CCC):** Crucial for stability.
    3.  **Hydrodissection:** Separates cortex from capsule.
    4.  **Nucleofractis:** Nucleus is chopped/divided (e.g., Divide and Conquer, Stop and Chop) and emulsified.
    5.  **Irrigation/Aspiration (I/A):** Removal of cortex.
    6.  **IOL Implantation:** Foldable IOL (Acrylic/Silicone) injected into the bag.
*   **Advantages:** Topical anesthesia possible, no sutures, minimal astigmatism, rapid visual recovery.

#### E. Femtosecond Laser-Assisted Cataract Surgery (FLACS)
*   **Mechanism:** Uses **Nd:Glass** laser (1053 nm) for photodisruption.
*   **Automated Steps:**
    1.  Corneal incisions.
    2.  Anterior Capsulotomy (perfectly circular).
    3.  Lens fragmentation (Softening the nucleus).
    4.  Astigmatic keratotomy.
*   **Benefit:** Precision and reduced ultrasonic energy requirement.

### 4. Intraocular Lenses (IOLs)

*   **Location:**
    *   **Posterior Chamber (PCIOL):** Placed in the capsular bag (ideal) or ciliary sulcus.
    *   **Anterior Chamber (ACIOL):** Used if posterior capsule support is lost. Requires peripheral iridotomy.
*   **Material:**
    *   **Rigid:** [[PMMA]] (Polymethyl methacrylate) - used in SICS/ECCE.
    *   **Foldable:** Hydrophobic/Hydrophilic Acrylic, Silicone - used in Phaco.
*   **Optics:**
    *   **Monofocal:** Fixed focus (usually for distance).
    *   **Multifocal/Trifocal:** Multiple foci for distance, intermediate, and near.
    *   **Toric IOL:** Corrects pre-existing [[Astigmatism]].
    *   **Accommodative:** Moves/changes shape to allow focus change.

### 5. Complications of Cataract Surgery

#### A. Intra-operative
*   **Posterior Capsule Rupture (PCR):** Commonest operative complication. May lead to vitreous loss or dropped nucleus.
*   **Vitreous Loss:** Requires anterior vitrectomy.
*   **Expulsive Choroidal Hemorrhage:** Rare, disastrous. Caused by bleeding from posterior ciliary arteries due to sudden pressure drop.
*   **Descemet’s Membrane Detachment:** Treated with air/gas bubble (descemetopexy).

#### B. Early Post-operative
*   **Endophthalmitis:**
    *   *Acute (<7 days):* Usually *Staph. epidermidis* (Coagulase-negative Staph), *Staph. aureus*, or *Pseudomonas*.
    *   *Signs:* Pain, hypopyon, loss of vision, lid edema.
    *   *Treatment:* Intravitreal antibiotics (Vancomycin + Ceftazidime) + Vitrectomy if vision is PL only.
*   **Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome (TASS):** Sterile inflammation due to toxins (e.g., instrument residue). Treated with steroids.
*   **Striate Keratopathy:** Corneal edema due to endothelial damage.
*   **Iris Prolapse:** Through the wound.

#### C. Late Post-operative
*   **Posterior Capsular Opacification (PCO):** Also called "After Cataract". Most common late complication.
    *   *Types:* **Elschnig’s Pearls** (vacuolated epithelial cells), **Soemmering’s Ring**.
    *   *Treatment:* **Nd:YAG Laser Capsulotomy**.
*   **Cystoid Macular Edema (CME):** Known as **Irvine-Gass Syndrome**. Peaks at 6-10 weeks. Treat with NSAIDs/Steroids.
*   **Retinal Detachment (RD):** Higher risk in high myopia and after PCR.
*   **IOL Malposition:** Sunset (inferior) or Sunrise (superior) syndrome.
*   **Pseudophakic Bullous Keratopathy (PBK):** Permanent corneal edema due to endothelial cell loss.

### 6. Management of Congenital Cataract

**Clinical Implications:** Early surgery is crucial to prevent stimulus-deprivation [[Amblyopia]].

*   **Timing:**
    *   **Bilateral Dense:** Operate at 4–6 weeks of age.
    *   **Unilateral Dense:** Urgent! Operate within days to weeks.
*   **Surgical Technique:**
    *   **Lensectomy** or **Lens Aspiration**.
    *   **Primary Posterior Capsulotomy (PPC) + Anterior Vitrectomy** is mandatory in children < 6 years to prevent PCO (which is very aggressive in children).
*   **Visual Rehabilitation:** IOL implantation (if age > 2 years), Contact lenses (for unilateral aphakia), or Glasses (bilateral aphakia).
