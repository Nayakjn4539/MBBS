# [[OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH]] > Periodical examinations are effective in prevention of occupational diseases

### Periodical Examinations in Occupational Health

Periodical medical examinations are a crucial component of **Medical Measures** in the prevention of occupational diseases. While pre-placement examinations focus on **[[Ergonomics]]** (fitting the man to the job), periodical examinations focus on early detection and maintenance of health.

#### 1. Rationale: Why are they Effective?
Periodical examinations are considered effective for the following reasons:
*   **Long Latent Period:** Many [[occupational diseases]] (e.g., **[[Pneumoconiosis]]**, occupational cancers) require months or even years to develop.
*   **Sub-clinical Stage:** The slow development of these diseases often leads to non-recognition in the early stages. Workers may remain asymptomatic despite underlying pathology.
*   **Secondary Prevention:** These exams serve as **[[Secondary level of prevention]]**. They aim for **early diagnosis and prompt treatment**, allowing for intervention before the disease becomes disabling or irreversible.
*   **Assessment of Control Measures:** They help verify if the engineering control measures (e.g., ventilation, dust control) in the factory are working effectively.

#### 2. Objectives
*   To detect any **deviation from normal health** at the earliest possible stage.
*   To check the physical and mental efficiency of the workers.
*   To determine if a worker is fit to continue in their current job or requires job rotation.
*   To assess the nature and degree of disability in workers returning from medical leave.

#### 3. Frequency of Examination
The frequency and content of the examination depend strictly on the **nature of the occupational exposure** and the hazardous substance involved.

| Exposure Type | Recommended Frequency |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Most Occupations** | Once a Year (Annual) |
| **Radiation** | Every 2 Months (Replacement/Exam) |
| **[[Lead Poisoning]]**, Radium, Toxic Dyes | Monthly |
| **Irritant Chemicals (e.g., Dichromates)** | Daily (Skin inspection) |

#### 4. Components of Periodical Examination
The examination must be comprehensive and tailored to the specific risks:
1.  **Physical Examination:** General check-up including skin, vision, and hearing.
2.  **Biological Monitoring:**
    *   **Blood:** Estimation of basophilic stippling or blood lead levels for **[[Lead Poisoning]]**.
    *   **Urine:** For toxic metabolites (e.g., Coproporphyrin).
3.  **Radiological Examination:** Chest X-ray for workers in dusty industries to detect **[[Silicosis]]** or **[[Asbestosis]]**.

> **Clinical Relevance:**
> In **[[Silicosis]]**, the "Snow storm appearance" on a Chest X-ray is a late finding. Periodical pulmonary function tests (PFT) can detect restrictive lung changes much earlier, allowing the worker to be moved to a dust-free area to prevent progression to **[[Progressive Massive Fibrosis]]**.

#### 5. Management of Detected Cases
If a worker is found to be suffering from an occupational disease or shows early signs of toxicity:
*   **Prompt Treatment:** Initiate medical management immediately.
*   **Job Rotation:** Transfer the worker to a different department where there is no exposure to the offending agent (e.g., moving a worker with dermatitis away from chemical solvents).
*   **Notification:** Notify the appropriate authorities (e.g., under the **[[Factories Act, 1948]]**).
