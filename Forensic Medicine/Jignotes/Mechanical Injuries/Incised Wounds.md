# [[Mechanical Injuries]] > Incised Wounds

### Definition
An [[incised wound]] (cut or slice) is a clean cut through the tissues, produced by the pressure and friction (drawing action) of a sharp-edged object or weapon.
*   **Key Feature:** The **length** of the wound on the surface is greater than its **depth** and width.

### Causes and Weapons
*   **Weapons:** Knife, razor, scalpel, sword, dagger.
*   **Common Objects:** Broken glass, metal sheet edges, sharp stones.
*   **Mechanism:** Produced by pressing the weapon into the tissues and dragging it across the surface.

### Characteristics of Incised Wounds
**1. Margins/Edges**
*   **Clean-cut:** The edges are smooth, well-defined, and even.
*   **Everted:** The edges usually gape or turn outwards due to the elasticity of the skin.
*   **Exception:** In areas with loose skin or subcutaneous muscle insertion (e.g., **[[scrotum]]**, axilla), the edges may be **inverted** or zig-zag.
*   **Absence of Trauma:** The edges are free from [[abrasions]] and [[contusions]] (bruising).

**2. Dimensions**
*   **Length:** Always greater than the width and depth.
*   **Gaping:** The wound gapes more if the cut is transverse to [[Langer's lines]] (cleavage lines of the skin). If parallel to these lines, the wound gapes less.

**3. Shape**
*   Usually **spindle-shaped** (fusiform) due to the retraction of cut skin edges.

**4. Hemorrhage**
*   **Profuse:** Bleeding is usually extensive because the vessels are cut cleanly and cannot retract or undergo spasm to stop bleeding.
*   **Spurting:** Arterial spurting may be seen on the surroundings or clothes.

**5. Direction (Head and Tailing)**
*   **Head (Start):** The wound is deeper at the beginning where maximum pressure is applied.
*   **Tail (End):** The wound becomes shallower at the end as the weapon is lifted off. This phenomenon is called **[[tailing]]**.
*   **Medicolegal Significance:** Tailing indicates the **direction** of the force (e.g., in a right-handed person cutting from left to right, the tail will be on the right).

**6. Beveling**
*   If the blade enters obliquely, one margin will be beveled (sloped) and the other undermined (shelf-like). This indicates the angle of the weapon.

**7. Bridging Tissues**
*   **Absent:** There are **no** tissue bridges (nerves, vessels, connective tissue) running across the gap of the wound. This is the most specific feature distinguishing it from a [[laceration]].

**8. Hair Bulbs**
*   Cleanly cut (not crushed).

### Special Types of Incised Wounds

#### 1. Hesitation Cuts (Tentative Cuts/Trial Marks)
*   **Definition:** Multiple, small, superficial, parallel cuts usually found at the beginning of the main fatal wound.
*   **Location:** Accessible sites like the throat (beginning of the cut), wrists, or groin.
*   **Significance:** Strong evidence of **[[suicide]]**. They represent the victim "building up courage" or testing the sharpness before the final fatal act.

#### 2. Defense Wounds
*   **Active Defense:** Incised wounds on the palms or flexor aspect of fingers caused by grasping the weapon.
*   **Passive Defense:** Cuts on the ulnar aspect of forearms or backs of hands/arms caused by raising hands to ward off a blow.
*   **Significance:** Indicates **[[homicide]]** and that the victim was conscious and resisting.

#### 3. Cut Throat Wounds
These are incised wounds on the neck, which can be suicidal, homicidal, or rarely accidental.

| Feature | Suicidal Cut Throat | Homicidal Cut Throat |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Site** | usually above the [[thyroid cartilage]] (Left side for right-handed) | Usually lower down (below thyroid cartilage) or variable |
| **Direction** | Oblique (From high on left to low on right) | Transverse or irregular |
| **Hesitation Cuts** | **Present** (superficial cuts at the start) | **Absent** |
| **Severity** | Usually less severe (Trachea/vessels may be spared due to head tilt) | Severe, deep, extensive (often cuts vertebrae) |
| **Tail** | Present | Usually absent |
| **Cadaveric Spasm** | Weapon may be firmly grasped in hand | Weapon usually absent |
| **Blood Splatter** | On front of body, mirror, or adjacent wall (if standing) | Variable, often on the assailant |

### Difference between Incised and Lacerated Wounds

| Trait | Incised Wound | Lacerated Wound |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cause** | Sharp-edged object (Knife) | Blunt force (Stone, Lathi) |
| **Margins** | Clean-cut, regular | Ragged, irregular, crushed |
| **Abrasion/Bruise** | **Absent** at edges | **Present** at margins |
| **Tissue Bridges** | **Absent** | **Present** (pathognomonic) |
| **Hair** | Cleanly cut | Crushed or torn |
| **Bleeding** | Profuse | Less (vessels crushed) |
| **Shape** | Spindle/Line | Irregular/Stellate |
| **Depth/Length** | Length > Depth | Variable |

### Medicolegal Importance
1.  **Nature of Weapon:** Indicates a sharp-edged weapon.
2.  **Direction of Force:** Determined by the "tailing" of the wound.
3.  **Age of Injury:** Can be estimated by healing stages (fresh hematoma -> scab -> scar).
4.  **Manner of Production:**
    *   **Suicide:** Accessible sites (neck, wrist), presence of hesitation cuts.
    *   **Homicide:** Inaccessible sites, defense wounds, deep severe wounds.
    *   **Accident:** Working with machines, broken glass (irregular edges).
5.  **Identification:** Broken fragments of the weapon found in the wound can identify the weapon.

### Autopsy Findings & Cause of Death
*   **Hemorrhage:** Most common cause (Hypovolemic [[shock]]).
*   **Air Embolism:** Specifically in cut throat wounds involving jugular veins.
*   **Asphyxia:** Due to aspiration of blood into air passages.
*   **Infection:** Septicemia (delayed cause).

### Mnemonic for Suicidal Cut Throat
**"S-L-I-T"**
*   **S** - **S**uperficial cuts (Hesitation marks) present.
*   **L** - **L**eft to right direction (for right-handers).
*   **I** - **I**nside/Above thyroid cartilage (High up).
*   **T** - **T**ailing present.
