# Bacterial Corneal Ulcer (Hypopyon Ulcer)

### Definition
A **Bacterial Corneal Ulcer** (suppurative keratitis) is defined as a discontinuity in the normal [[epithelial surface]] of the cornea associated with necrosis of the surrounding corneal tissue. When associated with a collection of pus (polymorphonuclear leukocytes) in the [[anterior chamber]], it is termed a **Hypopyon Ulcer**.

### Classification of Hypopyon Ulcers
Clinically, it is customary to differentiate between two entities based on the causative organism:
1.  **Hypopyon Corneal Ulcer (Ulcus Serpens):** The characteristic ulcer caused by [[Pneumococcus]] (*Streptococcus pneumoniae*).
2.  **Corneal Ulcer with Hypopyon:** Ulcers associated with hypopyon caused by other organisms (e.g., *Pseudomonas*, *Staphylococcus*, *Gonococcus*, *Moraxella*).

---

### Etiology
**1. Predisposing Factors**
*   **Corneal Epithelial Damage:** Essential prerequisite for most bacteria (except a few) to invade. Causes include trauma (nails, vegetative matter), contact lenses, trichiasis.
*   **Local Ocular Disease:** [[Chronic dacryocystitis]] (common source for Pneumococcus), dry eye, bullous keratopathy, neurotrophic keratopathy.
*   **Host Immunity:** Diabetes, alcoholism, old age, immunosuppression.
*   **Virulence:** Highly virulent organisms produce toxins leading to rapid necrosis.

**2. Causative Organisms**
*   **Common:** *Staphylococcus aureus* (most common globally), *Streptococcus pneumoniae* (most common in India), *Pseudomonas* (common in contact lens users).
*   **Intact Epithelium Invaders:** Bacteria capable of penetrating intact corneal epithelium.
    *   *Mnemonic:* **High Level CNS**
        *   **H**aemophilus aegyptius
        *   **L**isteria
        *   **C**orynebacterium diphtheriae
        *   **N**eisseria gonorrhoeae
        *   **N**eisseria meningitidis
        *   **S**higella

### Pathogenesis of Hypopyon
The formation of a hypopyon in a bacterial ulcer is a **toxic response**, not usually a direct bacterial invasion.
1.  **Toxin Diffusion:** Bacterial toxins diffuse through the [[Descemet's membrane]] into the [[anterior chamber]].
2.  **Iridocyclitis:** Toxins irritate the iris and ciliary body vessels.
3.  **Leukocytosis:** Outpouring of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) from the uveal vessels.
4.  **Gravitation:** Heavy cells settle at the bottom of the anterior chamber due to gravity.

**Clinical Implication:** In bacterial ulcers, the hypopyon is **sterile** (bacteria are absent in the pus) as long as the Descemet's membrane is intact. It is also fluid and **mobile** (shifts with head position), unlike fungal hypopyon which is often fixed/immobile.

### Pathology of Corneal Ulceration
The disease process follows four distinct stages:
1.  **Stage of Progressive Infiltration:** PMNs/lymphocytes infiltrate epithelium and stroma; necrosis begins.
2.  **Stage of Active Ulceration:** Necrosis and sloughing of epithelium, [[Bowman's membrane]], and stroma. Walls project (swollen lamellae); floor covered by necrotic material. Hyperemia of circumcorneal vessels.
3.  **Stage of Regression:** Induced by host defense/treatment. Line of demarcation develops. Necrotic material is phagocytosed.
4.  **Stage of Cicatrization:** Healing by fibrosis (scarring). Epithelium grows over the scar.
    *   *Outcome:* **Nebula** (faint), **Macula** (semi-dense), or **Leucoma** (dense white opacity).

### Clinical Features: Ulcus Serpens (Pneumococcal Ulcer)
Specific features of the classic hypopyon ulcer caused by [[Pneumococcus]], often associated with chronic [[dacryocystitis]].

**Symptoms:**
*   Pain (Remarkably little in the initial stage, leading to delayed treatment).
*   Watering and photophobia.
*   Blurred vision.

**Signs:**
*   **Ulcer Appearance:** Greyish-white or yellowish disc-shaped ulcer near the center of the cornea.
*   **Serpiginous Spread:** The ulcer creeps over the cornea. One edge is active (undermined, more infiltration) where the ulcer spreads, while the opposite edge may show simultaneous cicatrization (healing).
*   **Hypopyon:** A definite, sterile, mobile hypopyon is present. It may fill the anterior chamber rapidly.
*   **Iridocyclitis:** Violent inflammation of the uvea.
*   **Congestion:** Marked ciliary congestion.
*   **High Risk:** Great tendency for early perforation.

### Clinical Features: Other Bacterial Ulcers
*   **Pseudomonas:** Irregular sharp ulcer, thick greenish mucopurulent exudate, rapid spread (liquefactive necrosis), semi-opaque "ground glass" surrounding cornea. Can perforate in 48-72 hours.
*   **Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, Proteus):** Shallow ulcer, grayish-white suppuration, sometimes ring-shaped corneal infiltrate.
*   **Staphylococcus:** Oval, yellowish-white, densely opaque ulcer surrounded by relatively clear cornea.

---

### Complications
1.  **Toxic Iridocyclitis:** Due to toxin absorption.
2.  **Secondary Glaucoma:** Due to blockage of the angle by fibrinous exudates.
3.  **Descemetocele:** Herniation of Descemet's membrane (which is resistant to inflammation) through the ulcer. Sign of impending perforation.
4.  **Perforation:** Caused by sudden strain (cough/sneeze). Leads to [[iris prolapse]], anterior capsular cataract, or [[corneal fistula]].
5.  **Endophthalmitis/Panophthalmitis:** Spread of infection to inner eye structures.
6.  **Anterior Staphyloma:** Ectatic cicatrix (scar) with incarcerated iris tissue, formed after sloughing of the cornea.

### Management

#### 1. Clinical Evaluation
*   **History:** Trauma, contact lens use, steroid use.
*   **Sac Examination:** Rule out chronic dacryocystitis (regurgitation test).
*   **Staining:** 1% [[Fluorescein dye]] stains the denuded area green (viewed under cobalt blue filter).

#### 2. Laboratory Investigations (Mnemonic: SS - Scrape & Stain)
*   **Corneal Scraping:** Performed under local anesthesia using a Kimura spatula or bent 20G needle (blunt edge) from the base and margins.
*   **Microscopy:**
    *   **Gram Stain:** For bacteria.
    *   **Giemsa Stain:** For cell morphology/fungi.
    *   **KOH mount (10%):** To rule out fungal hyphae.
*   **Culture:** Blood agar (aerobic bacteria), Chocolate agar (Haemophilus, Neisseria), Sabouraud’s dextrose agar (fungi).

#### 3. Medical Treatment
**A. Antibiotics (Definitive Therapy):**
*   **Initial (Empirical):** Combination therapy to cover Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms.
    *   **Fortified Antibiotics:** Prepared from injectable vials.
        *   Fortified **Cefazolin** (5%) or **Vancomycin** (5%) for Gram-positives.
        *   Fortified **Tobramycin** or **Gentamicin** (1.3-1.5%) for Gram-negatives.
        *   *Alternatives:* Fluoroquinolones (Moxifloxacin 0.5%, Gatifloxacin 0.3%) monotherapy for smaller ulcers.
*   **Frequency:** "Loading dose" (every 5-15 mins for first hour), then hourly. Taper based on response.
*   **Systemic Antibiotics:** Generally not required unless there is scleral involvement, perforation, or *N. gonorrhoeae* infection.

**B. Supportive Therapy:**
*   **Cycloplegics:** **Atropine** 1% drops/ointment.
    *   Relieves ciliary spasm (reduces pain).
    *   Prevents formation of posterior [[synechiae]].
    *   Increases blood supply to uvea.
*   **Analgesics:** Oral NSAIDs (Paracetamol/Ibuprofen) for pain.
*   **Vitamins:** Vitamin C and A to aid healing.

**C. Treatment of Hypopyon/Complications:**
*   **Secondary Glaucoma:** Oral [[Acetazolamide]], IV Mannitol, or Timolol 0.5% drops.
*   **Chronic Dacryocystitis:** If present, perform Dacryocystectomy (DCT) to remove the reservoir of infection.

**D. Contraindications:**
*   **Do NOT use Steroids:** In the active stage of bacterial ulcers (risk of perforation/worsening).
*   **Do NOT Pad/Bandage:** Prevents discharge drainage and increases temperature, favoring bacterial growth. Dark goggles are preferred.

#### 4. Surgical Intervention
*   **Mechanical Debridement:** Removes necrotic tissue, improves drug penetration.
*   **Tissue Adhesive (Cyanoacrylate glue):** For impending perforation or small perforations (<2-3mm).
*   **Conjunctival Flap (Gundersen flap):** For non-healing ulcers/impending perforation.
*   **Therapeutic Keratoplasty (Tectonic Graft):** Removal of infected cornea and replacement with donor tissue for large perforations or non-responsive ulcers.
