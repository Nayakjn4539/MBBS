# [[Firearms And Ballistics]] > Rifled Firearms

### **Rifled Firearms**

**Definition and Mechanism**
A **[[Rifled Firearm]]** is a weapon where the inside of the barrel has spiral grooves cut into it.
*   **Purpose of Rifling:** To impart a spinning motion to the bullet along its longitudinal axis. This spin provides **gyroscopic stability**, ensuring the bullet travels nose-forward, increasing accuracy, range, and penetrating power.
*   **Lands:** The raised portions between the grooves on the inner surface of the barrel.
*   **Grooves:** The spiral cuts/sunken parts between the lands.
*   **[[Calibre]]:** In rifled weapons, this is the internal diameter of the barrel measured between two diametrically opposite **lands**.

### **Classification of Rifled Firearms**

1.  **Handguns (Short Barrel):**
    *   **[[Revolver]]:** Features a revolving cylinder with multiple chambers (usually 6) that align with the barrel for firing.
    *   **[[Pistol]]:** Features a magazine (spring-loaded) to hold cartridges. Can be semi-automatic (fires one shot per trigger pull) or automatic.
2.  **Shoulder Arms (Long Barrel):**
    *   **[[Rifle]]:** High-velocity weapons fired from the shoulder (e.g., Military rifles, AK-47, Sporting rifles). They have a long range and high penetrating power.
    *   **Machine Guns/Sub-machine Guns:** Automatic weapons capable of rapid continuous fire.

### **Ammunition**
A rifled firearm cartridge typically consists of four parts:
1.  **Cartridge Case:** usually brass/metal, expands to seal the chamber.
2.  **Primer (Percussion Cap):** Contains impact-sensitive explosive (e.g., Lead styphnate, Barium nitrate) to ignite the propellant.
3.  **Propellant ([[Gunpowder]]):** Usually smokeless powder (Nitrocellulose based) which generates high-pressure gas.
4.  **[[Projectile]] (Bullet):** Single mass, usually lead or metal-jacketed. Unlike shotguns, rifled ammunition *usually* does not contain a wad.

### **Wound Ballistics: Entry vs. Exit Wounds**

Identification of the wound type is crucial for reconstruction of the event.

| Feature | **Entry Wound** | **Exit Wound** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Size** | Generally smaller than the bullet diameter (due to skin elasticity). | Usually larger than the bullet; irregular and variable. |
| **Margins** | **Inverted** (turned inward). | **Everted** (turned outward). |
| **[[Abrasion Collar]]** | **Present**. A rim of abraded skin caused by the spinning bullet entering; diagnostic of entry. | **Absent** (unless "Shored exit wound"). |
| **[[Grease Collar]]** | **Present** (Dirt collar/Bullet wipe). Black ring of lubricant/debris on the inner edge of abrasion collar. | **Absent**. |
| **Tissue Defect** | "Punched out" appearance; loss of substance. | Slit-like or stellate; no tissue loss (just separation). |
| **Burning/Blackening** | Present in close range shots. | Absent. |
| **[[Tattooing]]** | Present in close/intermediate range. | Absent. |
| **Pink Coloration** | Tissue may be cherry-red due to CO (in contact shots). | Absent. |

### **Range of Fire Determination**

*   **Contact Shot:**
    *   Muzzle pressed against skin.
    *   **Stellate/Cruciate tear:** Common over bone (e.g., forehead) due to gas expansion between skin and bone (Blowback effect).
    *   **Muzzle Impression:** Imprint of the gun muzzle on skin (abrasion/contusion).
    *   **Cherry Red tissue:** Due to Carbon Monoxide in muscle/subcutaneous tissue.
    *   Soot/Powder found *inside* the wound track.
*   **Close Range (within flame reach ~15 cm):**
    *   **Burning/Singeing:** Hair burnt, skin scorched.
    *   **Smoke/Blackening:** Deposit of carbon soot; can be wiped off.
*   **Intermediate/Near Range (within powder reach ~60-90 cm):**
    *   **[[Tattooing]] (Stippling/Peppering):** Unburnt powder grains embedded in skin. *Cannot* be wiped off. This is antemortem in nature.
*   **Distant Range:**
    *   No burning, blackening, or tattooing.
    *   Only the bullet hole with **Abrasion Collar** and **Grease Collar** is seen.

> **Mnemonic for Range Features:**
> **C**ontact = **C**ruciate / **C**herry red
> **C**lose = **C**harring (Burning)
> **N**ear = **N**o wiping (Tattooing)
> **D**istant = **D**irt collar only

### **Related Phenomenon and Atypical Ballistics**

1.  **[[Kennedy Phenomenon]]**
    *   Surgical alteration of a gunshot wound (e.g., extending the wound for debridement or suturing) that makes it difficult to distinguish between entry and exit wounds or determine the range of fire at autopsy.

2.  **[[Ricochet Bullet]]**
    *   A bullet that rebounds or deflects off a hard surface (bone, wall, road) before striking the victim.
    *   **Features:** The bullet becomes deformed/flattened. The entry wound is large, irregular, and lacks an abrasion/grease collar because the bullet loses its spin. No burning/blackening is seen.

3.  **[[Tandem Bullet]] (Piggyback Bullet)**
    *   Occurs when a bullet gets stuck in the barrel (due to defect/low powder), and a second shot is fired. The second bullet pushes the first one out.
    *   **Result:** Two bullets enter through a single entrance wound or cause unpredictable trauma.

4.  **[[Yawing]] and Tumbling**
    *   **Yawing:** Deviation of the bullet from its longitudinal axis (wobbling) while flying.
    *   **Tumbling:** The bullet rotates end-over-end (somersaulting).
    *   **Effect:** Produces large, irregular, or "Keyhole" entry wounds even at a distance.

5.  **Lead Snowstorm**
    *   Radiological sign seen with high-velocity or semi-jacketed bullets (like hunting rifles).
    *   The lead core fragments and scatters in the tissue, appearing like a snowstorm on X-ray. It indicates the track of the bullet.

6.  **[[Souvenir Bullet]]**
    *   A bullet that remains lodged in the body for a long time (years) within a fibrous capsule.
    *   Can lead to lead poisoning ([[Plumbism]]).

7.  **[[Shored Exit Wound]]**
    *   An exit wound that mimics an entry wound.
    *   **Mechanism:** The skin at the exit site is supported by a tight belt, floor, wall, or chair back. The skin is crushed between the exiting bullet and the hard object, creating an **abrasion collar**, causing confusion with an entry wound.

8.  **Puppe's Rule**
    *   Used to determine the sequence of shots in skull fractures.
    *   A fracture line produced by a second shot will stop when it meets a fracture line produced by the first shot (fractures do not cross pre-existing fractures).

### **Medicolegal Aspects & Autopsy Findings**

*   **Fatal Period:** Depends on organ involved. Heart/Aorta injuries cause rapid death; Brain stem injuries cause instant incapacitation.
*   **Collection of Evidence:**
    *   **Clothes:** Must be air-dried and packed in paper bags (not plastic) to preserve GSR.
    *   **Skin:** Excision of skin around entry/exit wounds in preservative (Rectified spirit) for chemical analysis of powder residues.
    *   **Bullet:** Recovered bullets should be handled with fingers or rubber-tipped forceps (to protect rifling marks) and marked at the base/nose (not on the sides) for identification.
*   **Identification of Weapon (Ballistic Fingerprinting):**
    *   **Class Characteristics:** Rifling pattern (number of lands/grooves, twist direction) identifies the *make/model* of the gun.
    *   **Individual Characteristics (Striations):** Microscopic scratches on the bullet caused by barrel irregularities. These are unique to a specific gun (like a fingerprint). Matched using a **Comparison Microscope**.
*   **[[Gunshot Residue]] (GSR):** Detected on the hands of the shooter using Dermal Nitrate Test (obsolete), Harrison-Gilroy Test, or **SEM-EDXA** (Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis - Gold Standard).
