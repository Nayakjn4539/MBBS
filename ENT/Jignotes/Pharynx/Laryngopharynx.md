# [[Pharynx]] > Laryngopharynx

### **Laryngopharynx (Hypopharynx)**

The [[Laryngopharynx]], also known as the [[Hypopharynx]], is the lowest part of the pharynx. It lies behind and partly to the sides of the [[larynx]] and serves as a common pathway for both air and food,.

#### **Extent and Boundaries**
*   **Superior Limit:** The plane of the [[hyoid bone]] or the floor of the [[vallecula]] (upper border of the [[epiglottis]]),.
*   **Inferior Limit:** The lower border of the [[cricoid cartilage]], where it becomes continuous with the [[esophagus]],.
*   **Vertebral Levels:** corresponds to C3, C4, C5, and C6 vertebrae,,.
*   **Communications:**
    *   **Superiorly:** Continuous with the [[oropharynx]].
    *   **Inferiorly:** Continuous with the [[esophagus]] at the cricopharyngeal sphincter.
    *   **Anteriorly:** Communicates with the larynx through the laryngeal inlet,.

#### **Subdivisions (The 3 P's)**
Clinically and anatomically, the hypopharynx is divided into three distinct regions:

**1. [[Pyriform Sinus]] (Pyriform Fossa)**
*   **Anatomy:** A pear-shaped deep recess situated on either side of the laryngeal inlet,. It acts as a lateral channel for the passage of food.
*   **Boundaries:**
    *   **Medial:** [[Aryepiglottic fold]], posterolateral surface of [[arytenoid cartilage]], and [[cricoid cartilage]],.
    *   **Lateral:** [[Thyroid cartilage]] and [[thyrohyoid membrane]],.
    *   **Superior:** Separated from the oropharynx by the [[pharyngoepiglottic fold]],.
*   **Clinical Importance:**
    *   **Nerve Course:** The [[internal laryngeal nerve]] runs submucosally in the lateral wall of the sinus,. It is accessible here for local anesthesia but is also responsible for **referred otalgia** (ear pain) in malignancies.
    *   **Foreign Bodies:** It is a common site for the lodgement of foreign bodies (e.g., fish bones),.
    *   **Tumors:** Most common site of hypopharyngeal malignancy (60%).

**2. [[Postcricoid Region]] (Postcricoid Area)**
*   **Location:** The anterior wall of the hypopharynx. It lies directly posterior to the [[cricoid cartilage]].
*   **Extent:** From the level of the [[arytenoid cartilages]] (cricoarytenoid joint) down to the lower border of the cricoid cartilage,,.
*   **Visualization:** This area is hidden and often not visualized on indirect laryngoscopy unless there is pooling of saliva or edema.

**3. [[Posterior Pharyngeal Wall]]**
*   **Extent:** Extends from the level of the hyoid bone superiorly to the level of the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage inferiorly,.
*   **Width:** Extends between the apices of the pyriform fossae.

#### **Neurovascular Supply**

**Nerve Supply**
*   **Sensory:** Provided by the [[Vagus nerve]] (CN X).
    *   **Upper Part:** Supplied by the [[Internal laryngeal nerve]].
    *   **Lower Part:** Supplied by the [[Recurrent laryngeal nerve]].
*   **Motor:** Supplied by the [[pharyngeal plexus]] (except for the stylopharyngeus muscle).

**Blood Supply**
*   **Arteries:** [[Ascending pharyngeal artery]], [[Lingual artery]], and superior and inferior [[laryngeal arteries]].
*   **Veins:** Drain into the pharyngeal venous plexus and eventually the [[internal jugular vein]].

#### **Lymphatic Drainage**
The lymphatic drainage is crucial for the spread of malignancies.

| Region | Primary Drainage Nodes | Clinical Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Pyriform Fossa]]** | Upper deep cervical nodes (Level II, III) | **Rich lymphatic network**; high frequency of early metastasis,. |
| **[[Postcricoid Region]]** | Parapharyngeal, [[paratracheal nodes]], and supraclavicular nodes | Drains to Level II, III, IV, and VI,. |
| **[[Posterior Pharyngeal Wall]]** | Lateral pharyngeal/parapharyngeal nodes, retropharyngeal nodes | Drains to deep cervical nodes,. |

### **Clinical Implications**

**1. [[Carcinoma of Hypopharynx]]**
*   **Type:** 95% are [[Squamous cell carcinoma]],.
*   **Incidence:** Pyriform sinus (60%) > Postcricoid (30%) > Posterior pharyngeal wall (10%).
*   **Etiology:** Smoking and alcohol are major factors.
*   **Plummer-Vinson Syndrome:** Postcricoid carcinoma is significantly more common in females suffering from [[Plummer-Vinson syndrome]] (Paterson-Brown-Kelly syndrome),,.
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Dysphagia and Odynophagia.
    *   **Referred Otalgia:** Pain referred to the ear via the auricular branch of Vagus (Arnold's nerve) originating from the internal laryngeal nerve stimulation.
    *   Hoarseness (late sign due to direct laryngeal spread or nerve involvement).

**2. Important Clinical Signs**
*   **Chevalier Jackson's Sign:** Pooling of saliva in the [[pyriform fossa]], indicative of obstruction (e.g., tumor) in the esophagus or hypopharynx.
*   **Moure’s Sign (Absence of [[Laryngeal Crepitus]]):** Normally, moving the larynx side-to-side over the cervical spine produces a grating sensation (crepitus). In **postcricoid carcinoma** or retropharyngeal abscess, the larynx is pushed forward, and this crepitus is **lost**,,.
*   **Trotter’s Triad (for Nasopharyngeal Ca, but relevant context):** Conductive deafness, immobility of the soft palate, and trigeminal neuralgia.

**3. [[Killian’s Dehiscence]]**
*   A potential weak area between the two parts of the [[inferior constrictor muscle]] (Thyropharyngeus and Cricopharyngeus),.
*   **Significance:** Site of herniation for [[Pharyngeal Pouch]] ([[Zenker’s Diverticulum]]),,.
