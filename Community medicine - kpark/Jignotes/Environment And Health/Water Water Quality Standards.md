# [[Environment And Health]] > Water Water Quality Standards

### Water Quality Standards

**[[Safe and Wholesome Water]]** is defined as water that is:
1.  Free from pathogenic agents.
2.  Free from harmful chemical substances.
3.  Pleasant to the taste (free from color and odor).
4.  Usable for domestic purposes,.

If water does not fulfill these criteria, it is termed **polluted** or **contaminated**.

### 1. Physical Parameters (Acceptability Aspects)

The physical quality of water determines its acceptability by consumers.

| Parameter | Guideline Value | Remarks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Turbidity** | < 5 NTU (Ideally < 1 NTU) | Turbidity > 4 NTU is visible to the naked eye. High turbidity interferes with disinfection,. |
| **Colour** | < 15 TCU (True Colour Units) | Ideally < 5 Hazen units. Caused by organic matter, iron, or industrial waste,. |
| **Taste & Odour** | Unobjectionable | No specific health-based guideline, but changes indicate pollution. |
| **pH** | 6.5 – 8.5 | pH < 7 causes corrosion (releasing metals like lead); pH > 8 reduces efficacy of [[Chlorination]],. |
| **TDS** | < 600 mg/L (Desirable) | Total Dissolved Solids > 1000 mg/L makes water unpalatable and causes scaling,. |

### 2. Chemical Aspects

Chemical constituents can cause acute or chronic health issues.

#### A. Inorganic Constituents of Health Significance

| Chemical | Limit (mg/L) | Clinical/Public Health Relevance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Fluoride]]** | 0.5 – 0.8 (India)<br>Max 1.5 (WHO) | **Deficiency (<0.5):** Dental Caries.<br>**Excess (>1.5):** Dental Fluorosis (Mottling).<br>**Excess (>3.0):** Skeletal Fluorosis,,. |
| **[[Nitrates]]** | < 50 | Excess causes **Methaemoglobinemia** ([[Blue Baby Syndrome]]) in infants,,. |
| **Nitrites** | < 3 | Indicates recent pollution; can occur simultaneously with nitrates,. |
| **Hardness** | 100 – 300 (as CaCO3) | **Soft (<1 mEq/L):** Corrosive.<br>**Hard (>3 mEq/L):** Consumes soap, scale formation,. |
| **Ammonia** | 0.5 | Indicator of pollution by sewage/animal waste. |
| **Arsenic** | 0.01 | Causes arsenicosis, skin lesions, and cancer. |
| **Lead** | 0.01 | Neurotoxic; usually from plumbing. |

> **Clinical Relevance:** **Fluorine** is called a "double-edged sword" because both deficiency and excess cause pathology,.

#### B. Radiological Aspects,
*   **Gross Alpha Activity:** < 0.5 Bq/L
*   **Gross Beta Activity:** < 1.0 Bq/L

### 3. Microbiological Aspects (Most Critical)

Ideally, drinking water must contain **zero** pathogenic microorganisms.

#### Bacteriological Indicators
Instead of testing for every pathogen (which is difficult and expensive), we test for **indicators of fecal pollution**.

1.  **[[Coliform Organisms]] (Primary Indicator):**
    *   Includes *E. coli* and *Klebsiella*.
    *   **Why Coliforms?** They are abundant in human intestine, foreign to potable water, survive longer than pathogens, and have greater resistance to natural purification,.
    *   **E. coli:** The most precise indicator of fecal pollution,.

2.  **Fecal Streptococci:** Indicates **Recent** contamination,.
3.  **Clostridium perfringens:** Indicates **Remote (Old)** contamination,.

> **Mnemonic for Contamination Timing:**
> *   **S**treptococci = **S**hort time ago (**Recent**)
> *   **C**lostridium = **C**enturies ago (**Remote**)

#### WHO Guidelines for Bacteriological Quality,

| Water Source | Guideline Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **All drinking water** | **E. coli or Thermotolerant coliforms must not be detectable in any 100 ml sample (0/100 ml).** |
| **Treated water entering distribution** | Total coliforms: 0/100 ml. |
| **Large supplies** | Total coliforms must not be present in 95% of samples taken over 12 months. |

### 4. Surveillance of Drinking Water Quality

Key methods used for testing water quality in the field and laboratory:

*   **[[Horrock's Apparatus]]:** Used to estimate the **Chlorine Demand** of water (dose of bleaching powder required),.
*   **[[Orthotolidine Test]] (OT Test):** Measures both free and combined chlorine.
*   **Orthotolidine Arsenite Test (OTA):** Superior to OT test; measures Free and Combined chlorine **separately** and is not affected by interfering substances like nitrites/iron,.
*   **Presumptive Coliform Test (MPN):** Uses Multiple Tube Method (McConkey’s Lactose Bile Salt Broth). Estimates the Most Probable Number (MPN) of coliforms,.

> **> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Horrock's Apparatus**
> *Draw 6 white cups and 1 black cup. The black cup is used to mix bleaching powder, and drops are added to white cups to find the first cup that turns blue with starch-iodide indicator.*

### 5. Water Pollution Indicators Summary

| Indicator | Significance |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Biological Oxygen Demand ([[BOD]])** | Measures organic matter. >300 mg/L = Strong sewage; <100 mg/L = Weak sewage,. |
| **Dissolved Oxygen** | Depletion indicates organic pollution and microbial activity. |
| **Chlorides** | Excess over normal range indicates contamination from sewage/sea water. |
