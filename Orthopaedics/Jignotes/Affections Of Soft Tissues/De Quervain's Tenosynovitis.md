# [[Affections Of Soft Tissues]] > De Quervain's Tenosynovitis

### De Quervain's Tenosynovitis

**De Quervain's Tenosynovitis**, also known as **stenosing tenosynovitis** or **washerwoman's sprain**, is a painful condition affecting the tendons on the thumb side of the wrist. It is classified under affections of the soft tissues and specifically involves the constriction of the fibrous digital sheath.

### Relevant Anatomy and Pathology

*   **Location:** The condition affects the **first dorsal compartment** of the wrist at the level of the [[radial styloid process]].
*   **Structures Involved:** It involves the inflammation and thickening of the synovial sheath surrounding two specific tendons:
    1.  [[Abductor Pollicis Longus]] (APL)
    2.  [[Extensor Pollicis Brevis]] (EPB)
*   **Pathology:**
    *   Technically, it acts more like a **tenovaginitis** (inflammation of the fibrous sheath) rather than a pure tenosynovitis.
    *   Chronic inflammation leads to thickening of the common tendon sheath.
    *   This thickening narrows the fibro-osseous canal, restraining the free gliding of the tendons, causing entrapment and pain.

### Etiology and Epidemiology

*   **Cause:** The exact cause is often unknown (idiopathic), but it is strongly associated with **repetitive microtrauma** or overuse of the wrist involving thumb extension and abduction.
*   **Predisposing Factors:**
    *   **Occupation/Activity:** Common in washerwomen (wringing clothes), typists, and new mothers (repetitive lifting of babies).
    *   **Gender:** Significantly more common in **women** (Female:Male ratio high), particularly between 30 and 50 years of age.
    *   **Associated Conditions:** Can be seen in [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]].

### Clinical Features

The onset is usually insidious.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Pain:** Located over the [[radial styloid]]. It may radiate distally into the thumb or proximally up the forearm.
    *   **Aggravation:** Pain worsens with thumb movements (abduction and extension) or gripping actions (e.g., turning a door handle, wringing a towel).
    *   **Weakness:** Inability to perform activities requiring a firm pinch or grip.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Tenderness:** Localized point tenderness immediately over the [[radial styloid process]].
    *   **Swelling:** A visible fusiform swelling or thickening of the fibrous sheath may be present over the radial styloid.
    *   **Crepitus:** Rarely, crepitus may be felt on moving the thumb (though less common in stenosing types).

### Special Diagnostic Tests

#### 1. Finkelstein’s Test
This is the pathognomonic test for De Quervain's disease.
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Ask the patient to fold the thumb into the palm.
    2.  Wrap the fingers over the thumb (make a fist).
    3.  The examiner gently deviates the wrist towards the ulnar side (ulnar deviation).
*   **Result:** Excruciating pain over the [[radial styloid process]] indicates a positive test.
*   **Comparison:** Ulnar deviation with the thumb free is usually painless.

#### 2. Eichhoff’s Test
Often confused with Finkelstein's, but clinically similar in execution and interpretation for exam purposes (passive ulnar deviation of the wrist with the thumb clenched).

### Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Differentiating Feature |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Arthritis]] of 1st CMC Joint** | Pain is at the base of the thumb (carpometacarpal joint), not the radial styloid. Grind test positive. |
| **[[Wartenberg's Syndrome]]** | Neuritis of the superficial radial nerve; sensory symptoms (tingling) predominate. |
| **[[Intersection Syndrome]]** | Pain and swelling are more proximal (about 4 cm proximal to Lister’s tubercle) where the first compartment muscles cross the second compartment. |
| **Fracture of [[Radial Styloid]]** | History of trauma; tenderness on bone; X-ray confirmation. |

**Clinical Implication:**
Finkelstein’s test is **not** 100% specific; it can be false-positive in osteoarthritis of the [[first carpometacarpal joint]] and Wartenberg’s syndrome.

### Management

Treatment is graded based on severity.

#### 1. Conservative Management (First Line)
*   **Rest:** Avoidance of precipitating activities (e.g., wringing clothes).
*   **Splintage:** Application of a **Thumb Spica Splint** to immobilize the wrist and thumb (specifically the MP joint) to allow the inflammation to subside.
*   **Medication:** [[NSAIDs]] (Oral analgesics) to reduce pain and inflammation.
*   **Physiotherapy:** Ultrasound therapy or wax baths.

#### 2. Injection Therapy (Second Line)
*   **Corticosteroids:** Local infiltration of [[hydrocortisone]] or methylprednisolone into the tendon sheath (not into the tendon substance) often relieves symptoms effectively.

#### 3. Surgical Management (Third Line)
Indicated if conservative measures fail or in recurrent/chronic cases.
*   **Procedure:** **Surgical release** (Decompression).
*   **Technique:** A transverse or longitudinal incision is made over the first dorsal compartment. The thickened sheath is slit longitudinally to release the tendons.
*   **Post-operative:** Early mobilization is encouraged to prevent adhesions.

**Clinical Implication - Surgical Risk:**
During surgery, extreme care must be taken to identify and protect the sensory branches of the **[[superficial radial nerve]]**, which lie immediately over the first compartment. Damage leads to painful neuromas or numbness.
