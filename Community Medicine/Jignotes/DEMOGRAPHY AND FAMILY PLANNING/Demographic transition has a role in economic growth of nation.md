# [[DEMOGRAPHY AND FAMILY PLANNING]] > Demographic transition has a role in economic growth of nation

### **Role of Demographic Transition in Economic Growth**

The relationship between population dynamics and economic development is profound. As a nation moves through the stages of the [[Demographic Cycle]], changes in the age structure of the population create opportunities for accelerated economic growth. This phenomenon is primarily driven by the concept of the **Demographic Dividend**.

#### **1. The Mechanism of Economic Growth**
The transition from *High Birth/Death rates* to *Low Birth/Death rates* alters the population structure in a way that boosts the economy through the following mechanisms:

*   **Reduction in Fertility:** The transition begins with a decline in fertility levels. This rapidly reduces the child population (0–14 years).
*   **Rise in Working Age Population:** As the large cohort of children from the previous high-fertility phase grows up, they enter the productive age group (15–64 years). Simultaneously, the proportion of elderly dependents (>65 years) has not yet risen significantly.
*   **Decline in [[Dependency Ratio]]:** The combined effect is a "bulge" in the working-age population relative to dependents (children and elderly). This lowers the **Total Dependency Ratio**.
*   **Surplus for Investment:** With fewer dependents to support, households and the government have more resources available for savings and investment in health, education, and skill development, leading to capital accumulation and economic growth.

#### **2. Key Terminologies**

*   **[[Demographic Dividend]] (or Bonus):**
    *   A rise in the rate of economic growth due to a rising share of working-age people in a population.
    *   It occurs when the labor force grows faster than the population dependent on it.
*   **Demographic Gift:**
    *   The *initially* favorable effect of falling fertility rates on the ratio of the working population to the dependent population.
*   **Demographic Window:**
    *   The specific period of time in a nation's evolution when the proportion of the working-age group is particularly prominent.
    *   Typically lasts **30–40 years**.
    *   Defined by the UN as when the proportion of children <15 years falls below 30% and the proportion of people >65 years is still below 15%.
*   **Demographic Trap:**
    *   A situation where a developing country's population grows so rapidly (due to high birth rate and declining death rate) that the economic development cannot keep pace, potentially hampering progress.

#### **3. Prerequisites for Economic Growth**
The demographic dividend is **not automatic**. It is a potential that must be harvested. To convert this "Bonus" into actual economic growth, the following investments are required:
1.  **Health:** Ensuring a healthy workforce.
2.  **Education:** Skill development to make the workforce employable.
3.  **Employment:** Creation of jobs to absorb the large working-age population.
4.  **Good Governance:** Stable economic policies.

*If these conditions are not met, the "dividend" can turn into a liability (unemployment and social unrest).*

#### **4. The Aftermath: Demographic Burden**
Eventually, as the demographic transition completes (Stage 4 and 5), the large working population ages. This leads to:
*   Increase in the **Old Age Dependency Ratio**.
*   This creates a **Demographic Burden**, where a smaller working population must support a larger elderly population.

#### **5. Indian Scenario**
*   India is currently in the phase of **Demographic Dividend**.
*   India's **Demographic Window of Opportunity** is expected to be open from **2010 to 2050**.
*   While developed countries (Europe, Japan) deal with aging populations, India has the advantage of a young workforce.

*Draw a timeline showing the Dependency Ratio curve. As the curve dips (lower dependency), label the area between the curve and the baseline as the "Window of Opportunity" or "Demographic Dividend."*

### **Mnemonic: BONUS**
To remember the factors of Demographic Dividend:
*   **B** - **B**irth rate declines (Initiating factor)
*   **O** - **O**pportunity window (30-40 years)
*   **N** - **N**umber of workers increases (15-64 years)
*   **U** - **U**psurge in economy (if policies are right)
*   **S** - **S**avings and Investment increase

### **Public Health Relevance**
Public health administrators must realize that the **Demographic Dividend** is a time-limited opportunity. Investments in **Reproductive and Child Health (RCH)** to lower fertility, and **Non-Communicable Disease (NCD)** control to keep the workforce healthy, are economic imperatives, not just health goals.
