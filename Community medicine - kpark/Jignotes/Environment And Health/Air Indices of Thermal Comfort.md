# [[Environment And Health]] > Air Indices of Thermal Comfort

# Indices of Thermal Comfort

Thermal comfort is defined as that condition of mind which expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment. It is a complex subjective experience that depends on physical, physiological, and psychological factors. Since **Air Temperature** alone is not an accurate index of comfort, various indices have been developed to measure the [[Cooling Power]] of the air and heat stress.

The primary indices of thermal comfort are:

### 1. Air Temperature
*   This is the simplest measure but is considered unsatisfactory because it ignores humidity, air movement, and radiant heat.
*   It is measured by a standard dry bulb thermometer.

### 2. Air Temperature and Humidity
*   Considering these two together is better than temperature alone but still fails to account for air movement and radiation.

### 3. Cooling Power (Kata Thermometer)
*   This index combines **Air Temperature, Humidity, and Air Movement**.
*   It measures the "cooling power" of the air on the human body.
*   **Instrument:** [[Kata Thermometer]] (Alcohol thermometer with a large bulb).
*   **Readings for Comfort:**
    *   **Dry Kata:** Reading of **6** and above.
    *   **Wet Kata:** Reading of **20** and above.
*   *Current Use:* While originally an index of comfort, the Kata thermometer is now largely used as an **Anemometer** to record **low air velocities**.

### 4. Effective Temperature (ET)
*   **Definition:** An arbitrary index that combines the effect of **Temperature, Humidity, and Air Movement** on the sensation of warmth or cold felt by the human body.
*   **Principle:** It is the temperature of **still, saturated air** that would produce the same sensation of warmth or cold as the environment being tested.
    *   *Example:* If the ET is 30°C, it means the environment feels like a room at 30°C with 100% humidity and no air movement.
*   **Method:** Determined using [[Effective Temperature Charts]] (Nomograms) by plotting dry bulb temp, wet bulb temp, and air velocity.
*   **Limitation:** It ignores **Radiant Heat** (radiation from surrounding structures).

### 5. Corrected Effective Temperature (CET)
*   This is an improvement over the Effective Temperature index.
*   **Correction:** It replaces the Dry Bulb Temperature reading with the **Globe Thermometer** reading.
*   **Factors Included:** It accounts for all four factors:
    1.  Air Temperature
    2.  Humidity
    3.  Air Velocity
    4.  **Mean Radiant Heat**.
*   This is the most practical and widely used index when radiant heat (e.g., from factory furnaces or sunlight) is present.

### 6. McArdle’s Maximum Allowable Sweat Rate (P4SR)
*   Developed by McArdle, this index uses the **sweat rate** as the indicator of heat stress.
*   It predicts the amount of sweat excreted in 4 hours under specific conditions.
*   **Critical Values**:
    *   **4.5 Liters / 4 Hours:** Upper limit of tolerance for fit, acclimatized young men.
    *   **3.0 Liters / 4 Hours:** Upper limit for comfort zone.
    *   **2.5 Liters / 4 Hours:** Optimal for a working man.

### 7. Heat Stress Index (HSI)
*   It represents the ratio of the **evaporation required** to maintain thermal equilibrium to the **maximum evaporation possible** in that environment.
*   It is expressed as a percentage of the heat storage capacity of an average man.
*   **Interpretation**:
    *   **0:** No thermal strain.
    *   **10–30:** Mild to moderate strain.
    *   **40–60:** Severe heat strain.
    *   **100:** Upper limit of heat tolerance.

### 8. Equatorial Comfort Index
*   It denotes the temperature of still and saturated air which is physiologically equivalent to the climate under consideration.

### Comfort Zones (Indian Standards)

Comfort zones are the range of Effective Temperatures over which the majority of adults feel comfortable.

| Zone | Corrected Effective Temp (CET) (°C) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pleasant and Cool** | 20 |
| **Comfortable and Cool** | 20 – 25 |
| **Comfortable** | 25 – 27 |
| **Hot and Uncomfortable** | 27 – 28 |
| **Extremely Hot** | > 28 |
| **Intolerably Hot** | > 30 |

### Mnemonic for Indices
**"TEACH Me Heat"**

*   **T**emperature (Air)
*   **E**ffective Temperature (ET)
*   **A**ir Cooling Power (Kata)
*   **C**orrected Effective Temperature (CET)
*   **H**umidity + Temp
*   **Me** - **Mc**Ardle's P4SR
*   **Heat** Stress Index (HSI)

### Clinical & Public Health Relevance
*   **Prevention of Heat Stroke:** Understanding these indices helps in industrial medicine to prevent [[Heat Stroke]] and [[Heat Exhaustion]] in workers exposed to furnaces (Radiant heat).
*   **Productivity:** Deviation from the comfort zone (CET 20–27°C) significantly reduces human efficiency and increases the risk of accidents.
*   **Building Design:** Architects use CET and ET values to design proper [[Ventilation]] systems in hospitals and schools.
