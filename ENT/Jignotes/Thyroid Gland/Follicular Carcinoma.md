# Follicular Carcinoma of Thyroid

[[Follicular Carcinoma]] is a malignant epithelial tumor arising from the follicular cells of the thyroid gland. It is the second most common type of thyroid cancer, accounting for approximately 10–15% of all thyroid malignancies,.

### Epidemiology and Risk Factors
*   **Incidence:** Accounts for 10–15% of thyroid cancers,.
*   **Age:** Peak incidence occurs in the 5th and 6th decades of life (older than [[Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma]]),.
*   **Gender:** Female to male ratio is approximately 3:1.
*   **Dietary Factors:** More common in areas of **dietary iodine deficiency** (endemic goiter regions),.
*   **Radiation:** Exposure to ionizing radiation is a risk factor, though less strongly associated than with papillary carcinoma.

### Pathology
*   **Origin:** Malignant growth of thyroid epithelial cells.
*   **Gross Appearance:** Usually appears as a solitary, encapsulated nodule.
*   **Microscopy:**
    *   Resembles [[Follicular Adenoma]] but is distinguished by the presence of **capsular invasion** and/or **vascular invasion**,.
    *   Unlike [[Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma]], it lacks characteristic nuclear features (like Orphan Annie eyes) and Psammoma bodies,.
    *   **Multicentricity:** Lacks the multicentric nature seen in papillary carcinoma.

### Subtypes
Based on the extent of invasion, [[Follicular Carcinoma]] is classified into:

| Subtype | Characteristics | Prognosis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Minimally Invasive (Encapsulated)** | Focal capsular invasion without extensive vascular involvement. | Good prognosis, behaves similar to adenoma. |
| **Widely Invasive** | Extensive infiltration of thyroid tissue and blood vessels. | Aggressive behavior, higher risk of distant metastasis. |

### Clinical Features
*   **Thyroid Nodule:** Usually presents as a painless, solitary thyroid nodule or a rapid increase in size of a pre-existing goiter,.
*   **Metastasis:**
    *   **Hematogenous Spread:** Disseminates primarily via the bloodstream (unlike papillary which spreads via lymphatics),.
    *   **Sites:** Distant metastases are common, most frequently to the **bones** and **lungs**,,.
    *   **Lymph Nodes:** Regional lymph node involvement is uncommon (<10%) compared to papillary carcinoma,.
*   **Functional Status:** Rarely, functional metastases may occur, causing thyrotoxicosis even after total thyroidectomy.

### Diagnostic Workup
*   **Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology ([[FNAC]]):**
    *   **Limitation:** FNAC **cannot distinguish** between [[Follicular Adenoma]] and [[Follicular Carcinoma]] because diagnosis requires visualization of capsular/vascular invasion, which is not possible on cytology,.
    *   **Result:** Usually reported as "Follicular Neoplasm" or "Follicular Lesion",.
*   **Ultrasound Neck:** Useful to characterize the nodule (solid vs. cystic) and check for vascularity, but cannot confirm malignancy definitively.
*   **Histopathology:** The definitive diagnosis is made only after surgical excision (lobectomy) by demonstrating invasion of the tumor capsule or blood vessels,.

> **Clinical Implication:** Since FNAC cannot confirm malignancy, a "Follicular Neoplasm" report is an indication for diagnostic surgery (lobectomy) rather than just observation.

### Management

#### 1. Surgical Management
The extent of surgery depends on the diagnosis and risk factors.

*   **Diagnostic Surgery (For FNAC result "Follicular Neoplasm"):**
    *   **Hemithyroidectomy (Lobectomy) + Isthmusectomy:** Performed to obtain a histological diagnosis,.
    *   If final pathology confirms **Benign Adenoma**: No further treatment is needed.
    *   If final pathology confirms **Carcinoma**: **Completion Thyroidectomy** (removal of the remaining lobe) is performed,.

*   **Therapeutic Surgery (For Confirmed Carcinoma or High Risk):**
    *   **[[Total Thyroidectomy]]:** Recommended for:
        *   Invasive carcinoma confirmed on frozen section or final pathology.
        *   Nodules >4 cm in elderly patients.
        *   Evidence of distant metastasis.
    *   **Neck Dissection:**
        *   **Therapeutic Neck Dissection:** Performed only if cervical lymph nodes are palpably enlarged or radiologically involved. Prophylactic/Elective neck dissection is **not** routinely done as nodal spread is rare,.

#### 2. Adjuvant Therapy
*   **Radioactive Iodine (RAI/I-131) Ablation:**
    *   Used after total thyroidectomy to destroy residual thyroid tissue and treat distant metastases (lung/bone),.
    *   Follicular cells usually retain the ability to take up iodine, making RAI effective.
*   **TSH Suppression:**
    *   Lifelong **[[Levothyroxine]]** is given to suppress TSH levels, as TSH can stimulate tumor growth.
*   **Radiotherapy:** External beam radiotherapy may be used for bone metastases or unresectable disease.

### Prognosis
*   Generally good, but less favorable than [[Papillary Carcinoma]].
*   **Poor Prognostic Factors:**
    *   Age > 45-50 years,.
    *   Widely invasive histology.
    *   Distant metastasis (Bone metastasis has a worse prognosis than lung).
    *   Tumor size > 4 cm,.

### Variant: Hurthle Cell Carcinoma
Considered a subtype of follicular carcinoma or a distinct entity.
*   **Histology:** Composed of oncocytes (Hurthle cells) rich in mitochondria.
*   **Behavior:** More aggressive than standard follicular carcinoma.
*   **Spread:** Higher incidence of lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis.
*   **Treatment:** Total thyroidectomy.
*   **Clinical Note:** Hurthle cells **do not** take up [[Radioactive Iodine]] avidly, making management of metastasis difficult. Follow-up may require Technetium scans.

### Mnemonics
*   **Spread of Carcinomas:**
    *   **P**apillary = **P**opular (Common), **P**alpable lymph nodes (Lymphatic spread), **P**ositive prognosis.
    *   **F**ollicular = **F**ar away metastasis (Hematogenous to Bone/Lung), **F**emale predilection, **F**NAC fails (cannot diagnose).
