Surface Infections Table



| Disease name | Causative organisms | Agent/vector | Agent factors | Source of infection | Infectivity | Secondary attack rate | Vector control measures | Age of host | Type of immunity | Special Effects during pregnancy if any | Environmental factors | Transmission | Incubation period | Clinical features | Complications | Diagnosis(all methods) | Prevention |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Leprosy | Mycobacterium leprae (Hansen's bacillus) | Acid-fast bacillus (intracellular/extracellular); insect vectors/tattooing needles (disputed) | Acid-fast, gram-positive bacillus; slow multiplication (doubling time 12–14 days); affinity for Schwann cells and macrophages; survives in environment up to 1.5 months; low pathogenicity | Human cases (especially multibacillary/lepromatous/borderline) and subclinical/inapparent infections; nasal secretions and broken nodules | High infectivity but low pathogenicity; rendered non-infectious by treatment with Dapsone (90 days) or MDT (4 weeks) | 4.4% to 12% among household contacts of lepromatous cases | Not applicable | All ages; incidence peaks between 20–30 years; significant proportion of child cases (9.49%) | Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) determines resistance and clinical type; humoral immunity present but not protective; HLA markers affect susceptibility | Disease exacerbated during pregnancy; transplacental transmission possible; breast milk may transmit infection; MDT is considered safe | Overcrowding, poor housing/ventilation, humidity (favors survival), poverty, social stigma, and rural migration | Droplet infection (respiratory tract via aerosols/nose blowing); direct skin-to-skin contact (prolonged >20 hours/week); indirect contact (soil/fomites) | Average 3 to 5 years (range: weeks to 20 years) | Hypopigmented/reddish skin patches with loss of sensation; thickened/tender peripheral nerves; nodules (leonine facies); muscle wasting/paralysis; Tuberculoid, Lepromatous, Indeterminate, Borderline types | Nerve damage, lepra reactions (Type I/II), muscle paralysis (claw-hand, foot-drop, wrist-drop), lagophthalmos, plantar ulcers, facial disfigurement, blindness, social stigma | Clinical examination (cardinal signs: lesions, sensory loss, nerve thickening); slit-and-scrape skin smears (Bacterial/Morphological Index); Lepromin test (prognostic/CMI status); Biopsy; Histamine test; Foot-pad culture; FLA-ABS, ELISA | Early case detection (SET approach); Multi-Drug Therapy (MDT: Rifampicin, Dapsone, Clofazimine); BCG vaccination; Single-dose Rifampicin (SDR) prophylaxis for contacts; Mycobacterium Indicus Pranii (MIP) vaccine; disability prevention (DPMR/POD) |
| Tetanus | Clostridium tetani | Soil-borne spores (No insect vector); gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-bearing bacillus | Produces potent exotoxins (tetanospasmin, tetanolysin); spores are highly resistant to boiling, disinfectants, and environmental heat | Soil, dust, and animal/human excreta (intestines of herbivores); infected middle ear discharge | Non-communicable from person to person (high pathogenicity/virulence but zero communicability) | 0% (Not applicable) | Not applicable | All ages; newborns (neonatal tetanus); active ages 5–40 years (traumatic) | No natural immunity from infection; antitoxin-mediated (active/artificial immunity via vaccination); passive immunity (IgG) transferred from mother to baby | Puerperal/post-abortal tetanus (unsterile delivery); maternal immunization (TT/Td) protects both mother and newborn | Hot, damp climate; soil contamination; man-made hazards; unhygienic customs (applying dung to wounds); unsterile delivery practices (unclean cord cutting) | Direct inoculation of spores into skin/mucosa via contaminated wounds (pricks, burns, bites, unsterile surgery, umbilical stump) | Usually 6 to 10 days (range: 1 day to several months) | Muscle rigidity, painful paroxysmal spasms, trismus (lock-jaw), risus sardonicus, opisthotonos; neonates: initially flaccid, then stiffness/inability to suck | High mortality (40–80%); respiratory failure, asphyxia, fractures, neonatal brain damage | Clinical diagnosis (rigidity, spasms); history of injury/exposure; Spatula test | Active immunization (DPT, Pentavalent, TT/Td); Passive immunization (TIG or ATS); five cleans for delivery; surgical toilet/cleaning of wounds; health education |
| Trachoma | Chlamydia trachomatis (serotypes A, B, C; also D-K) | Obligatory intracellular bacteria; mechanical vectors: Eye-seeking flies ( Musca sorbens , M. domestica ) | Resembles bacteria but reproduces only within living cells; Halberstaedter-Prowazek inclusion bodies | Ocular and nasal discharges of infected persons (mostly children) and contaminated fomites | Low infectivity; infectious as long as active lesions are present | Not in source | Fly control (environmental sanitation, elimination of breeding places, screening of houses) | Primarily children (ages 2–5 years); visual impairment/sequelae seen in adults | No natural/long-lasting immunity; reinfection is common; inflammation may undergo spontaneous resolution or progress to scarring | Not in source | Poverty, overcrowding, water scarcity (lack of face washing), dry winds, dust, smoke, seasonal fly epidemics | Direct or indirect contact with ocular/nasal discharges via fingers or fomites (towels, kajal sticks); mechanical transmission by flies; venereal transmission (sporadic) | 5 to 12 days | Chronic conjunctivitis, follicles on upper tarsal conjunctiva, limbal follicles (Herbert's pits), vascular pannus, lacrymation, redness | Conjunctival scarring, trichiasis (inward eyelashes), entropion, corneal ulceration, corneal opacity, irreversible blindness | Clinical grading (WHO simplified system: TF, TI, TS, TT, CO); demonstration of inclusion bodies (Giemsa/IF stain); NAAT/PCR | SAFE strategy (Surgery, Antibiotics - Tetracycline/Azithromycin, Facial cleanliness, Environmental improvement); health education; mass treatment campaigns |
