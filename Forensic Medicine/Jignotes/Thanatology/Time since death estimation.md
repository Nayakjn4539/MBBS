# [[Thanatology]] > Time since death estimation

### Estimation of Time Since Death (Postmortem Interval - PMI)

Determining the [[Time Since Death]] is one of the most difficult and crucial problems in forensic medicine. The exact time cannot be fixed by any single method; only an approximate range can be estimated. The longer the postmortem interval, the wider the range of error.

### I. Immediate Signs (Somatic Death)
These signs indicate that death has occurred but are of limited use for precise timing.
*   **Loss of Voluntary Movement & Sensibility:** Immediate.
*   **Cessation of Respiration & Circulation:** Immediate.

### II. Early Postmortem Changes (Molecular Death)

#### 1. Cooling of the Body ([[Algor Mortis]])
The body cools from 37°C to equilibrium with the ambient temperature via radiation, conduction, and convection.
*   **Pattern:** The cooling curve is **Sigmoid (inverted 'S' shape)**.
*   **Measurement:** [[Rectal temperature]] is standard (thermometer inserted 8-10 cm). Ideally recorded from the **Subhepatic space** (via abdominal stab). 
*   **Rate of Cooling:**
    *   Average fall: **0.4°C to 0.7°C per hour**. 
    *   Rough Rule: Fall of 1.5°F per hour in summer and 1°F per hour in winter.
*   **Henssge's Nomogram:** A standard chart used to estimate TSD based on rectal temp, ambient temp, and body weight.
*   **Factors Affecting Cooling:**
    *   **Body Build:** Children/emaciated cool faster; Obese cool slower.
    *   **Environment:** Moving air/water accelerates cooling.
    *   **Mode of Death:** [[Postmortem Caloricity]] (rise in temperature) is seen in Strychnine poisoning, Tetanus, and Septicemia.

#### 2. Postmortem Staining ([[Livor Mortis]])
*   **Mechanism:** Gravitational settling of blood in capillaries.
*   **Timing:**
    *   **Appears:** 30 minutes to 1 hour.
    *   **Mottling:** 1–4 hours.
    *   **Fully Developed/Max:** 6–12 hours.
    *   **Fixation:** 6–12 hours (Does not blanch on pressure).
*   **Significance:** Indicates TSD and if the body was moved after death.

#### 3. [[Rigor Mortis]] (Cadaveric Rigidity)
Stiffening of muscles due to depletion of [[ATP]].
*   **Progression (Nysten's Rule):** Starts in involuntary muscles (heart/eyelids) $\rightarrow$ Jaw $\rightarrow$ Neck $\rightarrow$ Upper limbs $\rightarrow$ Trunk $\rightarrow$ Lower limbs.
*   **Rule of 12 (General Guideline for India):**
    *   **12 Hours:** Stiffening develops (Ascending).
    *   **12 Hours:** Stiffness persists (Maintained).
    *   **12 Hours:** Stiffness passes off (Descending) due to secondary flaccidity (decomposition).
*   **Factors:**
    *   **Heat:** Accelerates onset and passing.
    *   **Cold:** Delays onset and duration.
    *   **Exhaustion/Convulsions:** Very rapid onset (e.g., Strychnine poisoning).

#### 4. Eye Changes
*   **Corneal Opacity:**
    *   Open eyes: Cloudy in a few hours.
    *   Closed eyes: Clear for 24 hours.
*   **Tache Noire:** Brownish triangular discoloration of exposed sclera due to drying. Seen in **3–4 hours**. 
*   **Kevorkian Sign (Cattle-trucking):** Segmentation of retinal blood columns. Seen within minutes. 
*   **Biochemical:** [[Vitreous Potassium]] concentration rises linearly with TSD.
    *   **Formula (Sturner):** $TSD (hours) = 7.14 \times [K^+] - 39.1$

### III. Late Postmortem Changes (Decomposition)

[[Putrefaction]] follows a chronological order, though highly variable based on environment.

**Chronology of Putrefaction (Average conditions):**
| Time | Finding | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **12–24 Hours** | Greenish discoloration in Right Iliac Fossa | Sulphmethaemoglobin formation |
| **24–36 Hours** | [[Marbling]] of skin | Staining of superficial veins (green/purple) |
| **2–3 Days** | Bloating/Gas formation | Distension of abdomen, scrotum, face |
| **3–5 Days** | Skin slippage, Blisters, [[Postmortem Purge]] | Epidermis separation, gas pressure forcing fluids out |
| **5–10 Days** | Liquefaction of soft tissues | Enzymatic breakdown |

**Casper's Dictum:** regarding rate of putrefaction:
$$1 \text{ week in Air} = 2 \text{ weeks in Water} = 8 \text{ weeks in Soil (Buried)}$$

**Modified Decomposition:**
*   **[[Adipocere]] (Saponification):** Formation of grayish-white waxy substance in moist/wet environments. Takes **3 weeks to months**.
*   **[[Mummification]]:** Drying/shriveling in hot, dry, windy environments. Takes **3 months to a year**.

### IV. Other Methods of Estimation

#### 1. Gastric Contents (Digestion)
*   Used to estimate time between *last meal* and death.
*   **Light meal:** Leaves stomach in **2–3 hours**.
*   **Heavy meal:** Leaves stomach in **4–6 hours**.
*   *Note:* Highly unreliable due to emotional state, shock, or head injury which delays emptying.

#### 2. Supravital Reactions
Reactions of tissues to stimuli after somatic death.
*   **Muscle excitability:** Skeletal muscles contract on tapping (mechanical) up to **2 hours**.
*   **Electrical stimulation:** Muscles respond up to **6–8 hours**.
*   **Pupil reaction:** Reacts to atropine/physostigmine up to **4 hours**.

#### 3. Forensic [[Entomology]]
Study of insects (Blowflies/Diptera) on the corpse.
*   **Life Cycle:** Egg $\rightarrow$ Larva (Maggot) $\rightarrow$ Pupa $\rightarrow$ Adult.
*   **Maggots:** Appear in **8–24 hours**.
*   **Pupae:** Appear in **3–6 days**.
*   **Significance:** Most accurate method for TSD in decomposed bodies (1–4 weeks).

#### 4. Hair and Beard Growth
*   Hair does **not** grow after death. Apparent growth is due to skin shrinkage.
*   Rate of beard growth in life is ~0.4 mm/day. If time of last shave is known, TSD can be approximated.

#### 5. CSF Changes
*   Lactic acid, Amino acids, and Non-protein nitrogen increase with TSD.

### Summary Mnemonic for Rigor Mortis
**"12 - 12 - 12"**
*   **12** hours to Appear.
*   **12** hours to Stay (Persist).
*   **12** hours to Disappear.

### Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Alibi verification:** Helps police verify suspect statements.
*   **Insurance/Inheritance:** Presumption of survivorship in commorientes (people dying together).
*   **Identification:** Helps narrow down the list of missing persons.
