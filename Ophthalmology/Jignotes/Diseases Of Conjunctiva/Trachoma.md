# [[Diseases Of Conjunctiva]] > Trachoma

# Trachoma (Egyptian Ophthalmia)

### Definition
[[Trachoma]] is a chronic granulomatous keratoconjunctivitis, primarily affecting the superficial epithelium of the conjunctiva and cornea simultaneously. It is the leading cause of **preventable blindness** worldwide.

### Etiology
*   **Causative Agent:** [[Chlamydia trachomatis]].
*   **Serotypes:** Serovars **A, B, Ba, and C** are associated with hyperendemic (blinding) trachoma.
    *   *(Note: Serovars D-K cause Inclusion Conjunctivitis/Paratrachoma)*.
*   **Predisposing Factors:**
    *   **Age:** Infection is usually contracted in infancy and early childhood.
    *   **Environmental:** Dry, dusty weather, poor hygiene, overcrowding, and water scarcity.
    *   **Socioeconomic:** Poor socioeconomic status.

### Transmission
Mode of transmission is often direct or indirect.
**Mnemonic: 3 Fs**
1.  **F**ingers (Direct contact)
2.  **F**lies (Vector transmission, *Musca sorbens*)
3.  **F**omites (Shared towels, handkerchiefs, surma-rods)

---

### Pathology
*   **Inclusion Bodies:** The organism produces intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies called **Halberstaedter-Prowazek (HP) bodies**.
    *   Consist of *Elementary bodies* (infectious) and *Initial/Reticulate bodies* (reproductive).
*   **Cellular Response:** Leber cells (large multinucleated histiocytes) are seen in follicles.
*   **Immune Reaction:** It is a Type IV Hypersensitivity reaction.

---

### Clinical Features
The disease is divided into a phase of **Active Trachoma** (childhood) and **Cicatricial Trachoma** (middle age).

#### 1. Conjunctival Signs
*   **Congestion:** Of upper tarsal and forniceal conjunctiva.
*   **[[Papillary Hyperplasia]]:** Reddish, flat-topped raised areas giving a "velvety" appearance.
*   **Follicles:**
    *   Look like **boiled sago grains**.
    *   Most prominent on the **upper tarsal conjunctiva** and fornix.
    *   Pathognomonic if seen on bulbar conjunctiva.
    *   Consist of central Leber cells and peripheral lymphocytes.
*   **[[Arlt's Line]]:** Linear scarring in the sulcus subtarsalis (feature of cicatricial stage).

#### 2. Corneal Signs
*   **Superficial Keratitis:** Usually in the upper part.
*   **[[Herbert's Pits]]:** Oval or circular pitted scars in the limbal area left after the healing of limbal follicles. **Pathognomonic** of past trachoma.
*   **[[Trachomatous Pannus]]:** Infiltration of the cornea with vascularization, usually in the upper part.
    *   *Progressive Pannus:* Infiltration extends **beyond** the vessels.
    *   *Regressive Pannus:* Vessels extend **beyond** the infiltration.

### Grading Classifications

#### 1. WHO FISTO Classification (Current Standard)
This simplified grading is used for community assessment.

| Grade | Definition | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TF** (Trachomatous inflammation: Follicular) | Presence of **5 or more follicles** (at least 0.5 mm diameter) on the upper tarsal conjunctiva. | Active Disease |
| **TI** (Trachomatous inflammation: Intense) | Pronounced inflammatory thickening obscuring **>50%** of deep tarsal vessels. | Active & Severe |
| **TS** (Trachomatous Scarring) | Presence of scarring (fibrosis) in the tarsal conjunctiva (white bands/sheets). | Evidence of past infection |
| **TT** (Trachomatous Trichiasis) | At least **one eyelash** rubs the eyeball (or evidence of recent removal). | Potentially blinding |
| **CO** (Corneal Opacity) | Easily visible corneal opacity over the **pupil**. | Visual impairment |

#### 2. McCallan’s Classification (Historical)
*   **Stage I:** Incipient trachoma (immature follicles).
*   **Stage II:** Established trachoma (mature follicles/papillae).
    *   *IIa:* Follicular predominance.
    *   *IIb:* Papillary predominance.
*   **Stage III:** Cicatrizing trachoma (scarring begins).
*   **Stage IV:** Healed trachoma (sequelae only).

---

### Diagnosis
*   **Clinical:** Based on typical signs (TF, TI, Arlt's line, Herbert's pits).
*   **Cytology:** Giemsa stain of conjunctival scrapings shows **HP bodies** (basophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions).
*   **PCR/NAAT:** Highly sensitive but expensive.
*   **Micro-immunofluorescence (Micro-IF):** For serotyping.

---

### Complications and Sequelae
Chronic inflammation and scarring lead to blinding complications:
*   **Lids:** [[Trichiasis]] (most blinding), [[Entropion]], Tylosis, Ptosis, Madarosis.
*   **Conjunctiva:** Concretions, Xerosis (dryness), Symblepharon.
*   **Cornea:** Opacity (CO), Corneal xerosis, Secondary bacterial ulcers.
*   **Lacrimal:** Chronic dacryocystitis.

### Management: The SAFE Strategy
Developed by WHO for the Global Elimination of Trachoma by 2020 (GET 2020).

#### **S** - Surgery
*   For **Trachomatous Trichiasis (TT)** and Entropion.
*   Prevents corneal blindness.
*   Procedure: **Bilamellar Tarsal Rotation** is the standard procedure recommended by WHO. Other options include electrolysis or cryolysis for minor trichiasis.

#### **A** - Antibiotics
*   To treat active infection and reduce the community pool of infection.
*   **Drug of Choice:** [[Azithromycin]] (Systemic).
    *   **Adults:** 1 gram single oral dose.
    *   **Children:** 20 mg/kg single oral dose.
*   **Alternative:** Topical [[Tetracycline]] (1%) eye ointment BD for 6 weeks (used if Azithromycin is contraindicated or unavailable).

**WHO Guidelines for Mass Drug Administration (MDA):**
*   **Prevalence of TF > 10% (in children 1-9 years):** Mass treatment of the **entire community** annually for 3 years.
*   **Prevalence of TF 5–10%:** Targeted treatment of **family members/close contacts** of active cases.
*   **Prevalence of TF < 5%:** Treat individual **active cases** only.

#### **F** - Facial Cleanliness
*   Promotes removal of ocular discharge to prevent transmission by flies and fingers.
*   Critical for reducing re-infection rates.

#### **E** - Environmental Improvement
*   Provision of clean water and sanitation.
*   Control of fly population (*Musca sorbens*).
*   Proper waste disposal to reduce fly breeding sites.
