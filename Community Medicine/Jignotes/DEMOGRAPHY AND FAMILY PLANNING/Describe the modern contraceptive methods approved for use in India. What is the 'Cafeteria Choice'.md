### Modern Contraceptive Methods Approved in India

The National Family Welfare Programme provides a "basket of choices" for fertility regulation. These are broadly classified into Spacing Methods (reversible) and Terminal Methods (permanent).

#### A. Spacing Methods (Reversible)

| Method | Specific Type/Brand | Key Features & Mechanism | Clinical Relevance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Intra-Uterine Devices (IUDs)** | **CuT 380 A** | • Effective for **10 years**.<br>• Most effective reversible method.<br>• Releases Copper; causes foreign body reaction & sperm toxicity,. | **Emergency Contraception:** CuT can be inserted within 5 days of unprotected coitus. |
| | **CuT 375** | • Effective for **5 years** (Short term IUD),. | Useful for women wanting shorter spacing intervals. |
| | **LNG-20 (Mirena)** | • Hormonal IUD releasing 20 mcg Levonorgestrel/day.<br>• Effective for **10 years**. | Reduces menstrual blood loss; useful in menorrhagia. |
| **Oral Contraceptive Pills (OCPs)** | **Combined OCPs**<br>(Mala-N, Mala-D) | • Contains Ethinyl Estradiol (0.03mg) + Levonorgestrel (0.15mg).<br>• Inhibits ovulation. | **Contraindications:** History of thromboembolism, breast cancer, liver disease. |

#### B. Terminal Methods (Permanent)

1.  **Male Sterilization:**
    *   **[[No Scalpel Vasectomy (NSV)]]:** Minimally invasive, suture-less, OPD procedure. The vas deferens is brought out through a tiny puncture. It is safe, simple, and has fewer complications than conventional vasectomy,.
2.  **Female Sterilization:**
    *   **Tubectomy:** Performed via **Minilap** (mini-laparotomy) or **Laparoscopy**. Techniques involve occluding the fallopian tubes.

**Mnemonic for Spacing Methods:** **C-C-I-I-P**
*   **C**ondoms
*   **C**entchroman (Chhaya)
*   **I**UCDs
*   **I**njectables (Antara)
*   **P**ills (OCPs - Mala N/D)

### Cafeteria Choice

**Definition:**
The 'Cafeteria Choice' (or Cafeteria Approach) is a fundamental principle of the Family Welfare Programme where a **wide variety of contraceptive methods** are offered to the client, allowing them to choose the method that best suits their needs, preferences, and reproductive stage.

**Key Principles:**
*   **No Ideal Contraceptive:** It is recognized that no single method is perfect for everyone due to differing cultural, social, and physiological factors.
*   **Voluntary Choice:** The acceptor makes the decision without coercion, based on full information provided by the health worker (Informed Choice).
*   **Availability:** Ensuring a wide basket of choices (condoms, OCPs, IUDs, injectables, sterilization) is available at service delivery points.

### Delivery of Contraceptive Services in Rural Areas

The delivery system in rural India operates through a tiered infrastructure under the **National Health Mission (NHM)**, ensuring services reach the grassroots level.

#### 1. Village Level (Community Level)
*   **[[ASHA]] (Accredited Social Health Activist):**
    *   Acts as a **Depot Holder** for condoms, OCPs, and Emergency Contraceptive Pills (ECPs),.
    *   **Home Delivery of Contraceptives (HDC):** ASHA delivers contraceptives at the doorstep for a nominal fee (e.g., Re. 1 for a pack of 3 condoms).
    *   Counsels newly married couples on spacing (Ensuring Spacing at Birth scheme).
*   **Anganwadi Worker (AWW) & Village Health Guides:** Also act as depot holders for distribution of conventional contraceptives like Nirodh and oral pills.

#### 2. Sub-Centre Level (Population: 3000-5000)
*   **Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM):**
    *   Maintains the **Eligible Couple Register**.
    *   Authorized to insert **IUCDs** (CuT 380A) after training.
    *   Distributes OCPs and condoms.
    *   Provides education and motivation for family planning.

#### 3. Primary Health Centre (PHC) Level (Population: 20,000-30,000)
*   **Medical Officer:**
    *   Provides all spacing methods including IUCDs and Injectables (Antara).
    *   Performs **sterilizations** (Tubectomy/Vasectomy) often via **Fixed Day Static (FDS) services** (e.g., monthly or weekly),.
    *   Supervises the field staff (ANMs/ASHAs).

#### 4. Community Health Centre (CHC) / First Referral Unit (FRU)
*   Functions as a referral center.
*   Provides **Laparoscopic sterilization** (requires specialists/trained surgeons) and **Non-Scalpel Vasectomy (NSV)**.
*   Manages complications arising from contraceptive use.

#### 5. Special Strategies
*   **Mission Parivar Vikas (MPV):** Focuses on districts with high Total Fertility Rate (TFR) to saturate contraceptive availability.
*   **Social Marketing:** Distribution of contraceptives (e.g., Deluxe Nirodh, Mala-D) through commercial outlets at subsidized rates to increase outreach.
*   **Camp Approach:** Periodic sterilization camps are organized in areas where static facilities are insufficient.
