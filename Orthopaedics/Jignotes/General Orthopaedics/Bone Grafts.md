# Bone Grafts

[[Bone grafting]] is a surgical procedure where bone tissue is transplanted from a donor site to a recipient site to repair skeletal defects, promote healing, or provide structural stability. It is a fundamental procedure in orthopaedic surgery used to treat conditions ranging from [[non-union]] of fractures to large tumor resections.

### 1. Mechanisms of Bone Graft Healing
For a bone graft to be successful, it must possess one or more of the following biological properties. The "Gold Standard" graft ([[Autograft]]) possesses all three.

| Property | Mechanism | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Osteogenesis]]** | Cellular | The graft contains viable living bone cells ([[osteoblasts]] and osteoprogenitor cells) that survive transplantation and directly form new bone. |
| **[[Osteoinduction]]** | Chemical | The graft contains growth factors (e.g., [[Bone Morphogenetic Proteins]] or BMPs) that stimulate the host's mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into osteoblasts. |
| **[[Osteoconduction]]** | Structural | The graft acts as a passive scaffold or trellis upon which the host's new blood vessels and bone cells can grow (creeping substitution). |

**Biological Process:**
*   **Creeping Substitution:** In most free grafts (non-vascularized), the cells within the graft die (except surface cells). The graft acts as a scaffold. Host blood vessels invade the graft (revascularization), osteoclasts resorb the dead bone, and osteoblasts lay down new bone. The graft is eventually replaced by living host bone.

### 2. Classification of Bone Grafts

Grafts are classified based on their source, structure, and vascularity.

#### A. Based on Source

1.  **[[Autograft]] (Autogenous Graft)**
    *   **Definition:** Bone taken from the patient's own body.
    *   **Status:** Considered the **Gold Standard** because it is osteogenic, osteoinductive, and osteoconductive.
    *   **Common Donor Sites:**
        *   **Iliac Crest:** Most common source for both cancellous and cortical bone.
        *   **Fibula:** For long cortical struts.
        *   **Greater Trochanter/Distal Femur:** For cancellous bone.
    *   **Advantages:** No risk of disease transmission, no immune rejection, highest success rate.
    *   **Disadvantages:** Donor site morbidity (pain, infection, hematoma), limited quantity available.

2.  **[[Allograft]] (Homograft)**
    *   **Definition:** Bone taken from another human (cadaver or live donor, e.g., femoral head removed during hip replacement).
    *   **Processing:** Must be harvested under sterile conditions and processed (deep freezing, freeze-drying/lyophilization, or irradiation) to reduce antigenicity and infection risk. stored in **[[Bone Banks]]**.
    *   **Properties:** Primarily osteoconductive (scaffold); minimal osteoinduction; no osteogenesis (cells are dead).
    *   **Advantages:** No donor site morbidity, available in large quantities/sizes.
    *   **Disadvantages:** Risk of disease transmission (HIV, Hepatitis), slower incorporation, rejection risk, cost.

3.  **[[Xenograft]] (Heterograft)**
    *   **Definition:** Bone taken from a different species (usually bovine/cow or porcine).
    *   **Status:** Rarely used now due to high rejection rates and inferior mechanical properties.

4.  **[[Synthetic Bone Substitutes]]**
    *   **Definition:** Artificial materials designed to mimic bone matrix.
    *   **Materials:** Calcium phosphate, Hydroxyapatite, Tricalcium phosphate, Calcium sulphate.
    *   **Properties:** Primarily osteoconductive.
    *   **Newer uses:** Can be mixed with antibiotics to act as a depot for local elution in infection treatment.

#### B. Based on Structure

| Type | Characteristics | Primary Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Cancellous Graft]]** | Spongy, porous, high surface area. Rich in cells. | **Osteogenesis**. Used to promote union in non-unions or fill cavities (e.g., after cyst excision). Revascularizes rapidly. |
| **[[Cortical Graft]]** | Dense, hard, strong. Fewer cells. | **Structural Support**. Used to bridge large gaps or provide stability. Revascularizes slowly. |
| **Corticocancellous** | Combination of both. | Provides both stability and osteogenic potential. |

#### C. Based on Vascularity

1.  **Free Bone Graft:**
    *   The graft is detached from its blood supply.
    *   Relies on the host bed for revascularization.
    *   Most common type used.
2.  **[[Vascularized Bone Graft]]:**
    *   Transferred with its blood supply (artery and vein) preserved.
    *   **Technique:** Microsurgical anastomosis at the recipient site or pedicled rotation.
    *   **Indications:** Large defects (>6cm), avascular recipient beds (e.g., after radiation or severe scarring), congenital pseudarthrosis of tibia.
    *   **Common Sites:** Free vascularized [[fibula]] (peroneal vessels), Rib, Iliac crest.
    *   **Advantages:** The graft remains alive (viable osteocytes), heals like a fracture (not by creeping substitution), resists infection better, and provides immediate structural strength.

### 3. Indications for Bone Grafting

Bone grafts are indicated when natural bone healing is compromised or when bone stock is deficient.

1.  **[[Non-union]] of Fractures:** To stimulate biology and bridge the gap (e.g., Atrophic non-union).
2.  **Delayed Union:** To accelerate healing.
3.  **[[Arthrodesis]] (Joint Fusion):** To bridge the joint and create a solid bony union (e.g., Triple arthrodesis, Spine fusion).
4.  **Filling Bone Defects/Cavities:**
    *   After excision of benign bone tumors (e.g., [[Giant Cell Tumor]], [[Simple Bone Cyst]]).
    *   After [[Sequestrectomy]] in osteomyelitis (once infection is controlled).
    *   Traumatic bone loss (comminuted open fractures).
5.  **Corrective [[Osteotomy]]:** Open wedge osteotomies require grafts to maintain the correction.
6.  **Joint Replacement Revision:** To manage bone stock loss/osteolysis.

### 4. Common Techniques

*   **Chip Grafting:** Small chips of cancellous bone packed into a defect or around a non-union site.
*   **On-lay Grafting:** Cortical graft placed on the surface of the host bone and fixed with screws (Phemister technique).
*   **In-lay Grafting:** A slot is cut in the host bone, and the graft is fitted inside (seldom used now).
*   **Strut Grafting:** Using a strong cortical piece (like fibula) to bridge a large gap and provide mechanical support.
*   **[[Bone Transport]] (Ilizarov Technique):** Not a traditional "graft," but a method of generating new bone (distraction osteogenesis) to fill large defects without harvesting bone from elsewhere.

### 5. Clinical Implications & Complications

*   **Donor Site Morbidity:** Pain at the iliac crest is a common complaint, sometimes lasting longer than the fracture pain. Risk of nerve injury (e.g., lateral femoral cutaneous nerve), hematoma, or hernia.
*   **Graft Rejection/Failure:** More common in allografts. The host may encapsulate the graft in fibrous tissue rather than incorporating it into bone.
*   **Infection:** Dead bone (the graft) is an excellent medium for bacteria. Grafting should generally be avoided in the presence of active infection unless using specific antibiotic-impregnated substitutes or vascularized grafts.
*   **Transmission of Disease:** A major concern with allografts (HIV, Hepatitis). Rigorous screening and processing are mandatory.
