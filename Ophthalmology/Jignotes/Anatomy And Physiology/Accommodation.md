# Accommodation

**Definition**: Accommodation is the mechanism by which the eye changes its refractive power to focus on objects at different distances, specifically allowing the clear visualization of near objects by increasing the convexity of the [[crystalline lens]].

---

### Mechanism of Accommodation
The most widely accepted theory explaining this process is **von Helmholtz’s Capsular Theory**.

**1. State of Rest (Distance Vision):**
*   The [[ciliary muscle]] is relaxed.
*   The diameter of the ciliary ring is large.
*   This keeps the [[Zonules of Zinn]] (suspensory ligaments) taut/tense.
*   The tension on the zonules keeps the lens capsule distended, compressing the lens substance, making it flatter (less convex).

**2. Active Accommodation (Near Vision):**
*   **Contraction:** The [[ciliary muscle]] contracts (specifically the sphincter-like action).
*   **Relaxation of Zonules:** This pulls the [[ciliary body]] forward and inward, reducing the diameter of the ciliary ring and relaxing the tension on the zonules.
*   **Lens Moulding:** The elastic [[lens capsule]], released from tension, moulds the malleable lens cortex.
*   **Result:** The lens becomes more spherical (conoidal). The **anterior curvature** increases significantly (radius decreases from 10 mm to 6 mm), while the posterior curvature changes minimally.

**Physical Changes in the Lens:**
*   Increase in anterior curvature (primary change).
*   Increase in axial thickness.
*   Decrease in equatorial diameter.
*   Slight downward displacement due to gravity.

### The Near Reflex (Synkinesis)
Accommodation does not occur in isolation. It is part of a synkinetic triad known as the **Near Reflex**:

1.  **Accommodation:** Increases the refractive power of the lens to focus divergent rays from near objects onto the [[retina]].
2.  **Convergence:** Simultaneous medial rotation of both eyes (via [[medial rectus]]) to keep the image on the fovea of both eyes.
3.  **Miosis:** Constriction of the [[pupil]] (via [[sphincter pupillae]]) to increase the depth of focus and cut off peripheral spherical aberrations.

### Neural Pathway of Accommodation
The reflex is controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system.

*   **Afferent Pathway:**
    *   Retina $\rightarrow$ [[Optic Nerve]] $\rightarrow$ Optic Chiasm $\rightarrow$ Optic Tract $\rightarrow$ [[Lateral Geniculate Body]] $\rightarrow$ Visual Cortex (Area 17) $\rightarrow$ Parastriate Cortex (Area 19).
*   **Efferent Pathway:**
    *   From the cortex via occipitomesencephalic tract $\rightarrow$ **Edinger-Westphal Nucleus** (midbrain).
    *   Preganglionic fibers travel via the **Oculomotor Nerve (CN III)**.
    *   Synapse in the [[Ciliary Ganglion]].
    *   Postganglionic fibers travel via **Short Ciliary Nerves** to innervate the:
        *   **Ciliary Muscle** (for accommodation).
        *   **Sphincter Pupillae** (for miosis).

### Terminology and Measurements

| Term | Definition | Clinical Values |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Punctum Remotum (Far Point)** | The farthest point where an object is seen clearly. | Infinity (in [[Emmetropia]]). |
| **Punctum Proximum (Near Point)** | The nearest point where small objects are seen clearly with maximum accommodation. | Varies with age (Recedes as age increases). |
| **Range of Accommodation** | The distance between the Far Point and the Near Point. | Not the same as amplitude. |
| **Amplitude of Accommodation (A)** | The difference in dioptric power between the eye at rest (R) and the fully accommodated eye (P). <br> **Formula:** $A = P - R$ | **Age 10:** ~14 D (Near point 7cm)<br>**Age 40:** ~4 D (Near point 25cm)<br>**Age 60:** ~1 D (Near point 100cm) |

### Anomalies of Accommodation

**1. [[Presbyopia]]**
*   **Definition:** Physiological insufficiency of accommodation due to aging, leading to difficulty in near vision.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   Sclerosis (hardening) of the lens nucleus (decreased plasticity).
    *   Decreased elasticity of the lens capsule.
*   **Onset:** Usually around 40 years when the near point recedes beyond comfortable reading distance (approx 33cm).
*   **Treatment:** Convex (+) spherical lenses. Roughly +1D at 40yrs, increasing by +0.5D every 5 years (+2.5D to +3.0D by age 60).

**2. Insufficiency of Accommodation**
*   Accommodative power is significantly lower than the normal physiological limit for the patient's age.
*   **Causes:** Debilitating illness, anemia, stress, or prodromal [[glaucoma]].
*   **Symptoms:** Asthenopia (eye strain) and difficulty with near work.

**3. Paralysis of Accommodation ([[Cycloplegia]])**
*   Complete loss of accommodation.
*   **Causes:**
    *   **Drugs:** Atropine, Homatropine.
    *   **Disease:** Diphtheria, Syphilis, Diabetes, CN III palsy.
*   **Clinical Features:** Blurring of near vision (in emmetropes/hypermetropes) and photophobia (due to associated mydriasis).

**4. Spasm of Accommodation ([[Pseudomyopia]])**
*   Excessive contraction of the ciliary muscle.
*   **Causes:** Excessive near work in young adults, uncorrected [[hypermetropia]], or strong miotics.
*   **Features:** Patient appears myopic (distance vision blurs) due to induced minus power.
*   **Treatment:** Cycloplegics (Atropine) to relax the ciliary muscle.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Cycloplegic Refraction:** In young children, strong accommodation can mask hypermetropia. Cycloplegics (like Atropine or Cyclopentolate) are used to paralyze the ciliary muscle to reveal **latent hypermetropia**.
*   **Mydriasis vs. Cycloplegia:** Not all pupil dilators paralyze accommodation. Phenylephrine causes mydriasis without cycloplegia (sympathetic stimulation of dilator pupillae). Atropine causes both (parasympathetic blockage).

**Mnemonic for Near Reflex:** **AMC**
*   **A**ccommodation
*   **M**iosis
*   **C**onvergence
