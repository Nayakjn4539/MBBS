# [[HEALTH CARE OF THE COMMUNITY]] > What are the average populations catered in relation to health- in a village, sub-centre, PHC, BPHC or CHC? Who serves at the level of sub-Centre? What are the activities carried out at BPHC/CHC?

### 1. Population Norms for Health Infrastructure

The health infrastructure in India is organized based on population norms to ensure equitable distribution. The specific population coverage varies between **Plain areas** and **Hilly/Tribal/Difficult areas**.

| Level of Health Unit | Population Norm (Plain Area) | Population Norm (Hilly/Tribal/Difficult Area) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Village Health Guide / ASHA** | 1,000 | 1,000 (or habitation based) |
| **[[Sub-Centre]] (SC)** | 5,000 | 3,000 |
| **[[Primary Health Centre]] (PHC)** | 30,000 | 20,000 |
| **[[Community Health Centre]] (CHC)** | 1,20,000 | 80,000 |
| **Community Development Block** | 1,00,000 (approx. 100 villages) | -- |

> **Mnemonic for Population Norms:**
> **"3 to 5, 20 to 30, 80 to 120"**
> *   **3**k-**5**k (Sub-Centre)
> *   **20**k-**30**k (PHC)
> *   **80**k-**120**k (CHC)

### 2. Staffing at the Sub-Centre Level

The **[[Sub-Centre]]** is the most peripheral and first contact point between the primary health care system and the community. It is manned by the following personnel:

1.  **[[Health Worker Female]] (HW-F) / [[ANM]] (Auxiliary Nurse Midwife):**
    *   The key functionary responsible for MCH, Family Planning, and Immunization.
    *   *Note:* Under IPHS norms, Type B Sub-centres may have 2 ANMs.
2.  **[[Health Worker Male]] (HW-M) / Multi-Purpose Worker (Male):**
    *   Focuses on National Health Programs (Vector-borne diseases, etc.), environmental sanitation, and field visits.
3.  **Voluntary Worker / Safai Karamchari:**
    *   Assists in keeping the center clean and helping the ANM.

**Total Staff:** Usually **3** (1 Female HW + 1 Male HW + 1 Voluntary worker).

### 3. Activities at BPHC / CHC (Community Health Centre)

The **[[Community Health Centre]] (CHC)**, often functioning as the Block Primary Health Centre (BPHC) or Block level hospital, serves as the **First Referral Unit ([[FRU]])**.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Flowchart showing the referral chain: SC -> PHC -> CHC (FRU) -> District Hospital

**Key Activities and Functions:**

1.  **Specialist Medical Care:**
    *   It provides specialized medical care through four main specialists:
        *   **Surgeon**
        *   **Physician**
        *   **Obstetrician & Gynaecologist**
        *   **Pediatrician**
    *   *Newer norms also suggest including an Anesthetist and Eye Surgeon.*

2.  **First Referral Unit (FRU):**
    *   Acts as a referral center for **4 [[Primary Health Centres]]** (PHCs).
    *   Handles complex cases referred from PHCs.

3.  **Emergency Services (24x7):**
    *   **Emergency Obstetric Care:** Management of complications like PPH, Eclampsia, Sepsis.
    *   **Newborn Care:** Newborn Stabilization Units ([[NBSU]]) for sick newborns.
    *   Trauma and accident care.

4.  **Surgical Services:**
    *   Routine and emergency surgeries (e.g., C-section, Hernia, Hydrocele, Appendicitis).
    *   Family planning surgeries (Tubectomy/Vasectomy).

5.  **Investigative and Diagnostic Services:**
    *   X-ray facilities.
    *   Clinical Laboratory (Pathology/Microbiology).
    *   **[[Blood Storage Facility]]:** Essential for functioning as an FRU.

6.  **Implementation of National Health Programs:**
    *   Monitoring and supervision of national programs (e.g., **[[RNTCP]]**, **[[NVBDCP]]**) at the block level.
    *   Integrated Disease Surveillance (**[[IDSP]]**).

7.  **Administrative Functions (BPHC role):**
    *   The Block Medical Officer (BMO) at this level supervises the medical officers and health workers of the PHCs and Sub-centres within the block.
    *   Planning and budgeting for the block health unit.

*,,,,,*

> **Clinical Relevance:**
> A CHC is designated as an **FRU (First Referral Unit)** only if it has facilities for **C-Section (Surgical Intervention)**, **Newborn Care**, and **Blood Storage** on a 24-hour basis. This is critical for reducing [[Maternal Mortality Rate]] (MMR).
