# [[Sports Injuries]] > Frozen Shoulder (Adhesive Capsulitis)

### Frozen Shoulder (Adhesive Capsulitis)

**Frozen shoulder**, also known as **adhesive capsulitis** or [[periarthritis]], is a well-defined disorder characterized by progressive pain and stiffness of the shoulder joint which usually resolves spontaneously after about 18 months. It involves a chronic inflammatory process of the [[synovium]] and [[joint capsule]], leading to thickening, fibrosis, and contracture of the capsule.

### Etiology and Risk Factors

The exact cause and pathogenesis are often debated, but specific associations are well established. It is often bilateral (occurring in up to 30% of cases).

**Classification:**
*   **Primary (Idiopathic):** Occurs spontaneously without a clear precipitating event.
*   **Secondary:** Associated with pre-disposing factors.

**Risk Factors:**
*   **[[Diabetes Mellitus]]:** Strong association, especially with uncontrolled hyperglycemia.
*   **[[Thyroid Disorders]]:** Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.
*   **Trauma:** Previous injury to the shoulder.
*   **Immobilization:** Prolonged rest following injury or surgery.
*   **Age/Gender:** Most common in individuals aged 40–60 years; more common in females.

### Pathophysiology

The condition is characterized by a "capsulitis" (inflammation of the capsule) which progresses to thickening and fibrosis.
1.  **Inflammation:** Initial synovitis and capsular inflammation.
2.  **Fibrosis:** Thickening and contracture of the capsule.
3.  **Adhesions:** Formation of adhesions, particularly in the axillary fold (inferior recess) and the **rotator interval**.
4.  **Volume Reduction:** The joint volume decreases significantly, limiting movement.

**Clinical Implication:** In patients with diabetes, the condition is often more severe and resistant to treatment. Good glycemic control is essential for resolution.

### Clinical Features

The hallmark of the condition is **Global Restriction of Movements (ROM)**.

**Symptoms:**
*   **Pain:** Insidious onset, often severe, and typically worse at night (disturbing sleep).
*   **Stiffness:** Progressive limitation of range of motion.
*   **Functional Limitation:** Difficulty with Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) such as combing hair, fastening a bra (in women), or reaching into a back pocket.

**Physical Signs:**
*   **Restricted Movements:** Both active and passive movements are decreased.
*   **Capsular Pattern:** There is a specific pattern of restriction characteristic of this condition:
    *   **External Rotation** (Most restricted)
    *   **Abduction** (Moderately restricted)
    *   **Internal Rotation** (Least restricted).
*   **Pain at End Range:** Pain is noted at the end stage of stretching the joint.
*   **Muscle Wasting:** Disuse atrophy of the deltoid and supraspinatus may occur in chronic cases.

#### Natural History (Stages)
The disease typically passes through three clinical phases:

| Stage | Name | Duration | Clinical Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I** | **Freezing (Painful)** | 10–36 weeks | Acute pain is the dominant feature. Gradual loss of motion. Pain at rest and night. |
| **II** | **Frozen (Stiff)** | 4–12 months | Pain decreases but stiffness dominates. Global restriction of ROM. Functional disability is high. |
| **III** | **Thawing (Recovery)** | 12–42 months | Spontaneous improvement in range of motion. Pain resolves. |

### Diagnosis and Investigations

Diagnosis is primarily **clinical**, based on the history and the demonstration of the capsular pattern of restriction.

1.  **X-rays:**
    *   Usually **Normal**.
    *   May show disuse [[osteopenia]] (decreased bone density).
    *   Essential to rule out other pathologies like [[osteoarthritis]] or calcific tendinitis.
2.  **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):**
    *   Usually not required for diagnosis but shows capsular thickening and obliteration of the axillary recess.
    *   Useful to rule out intrinsic pathology like a [[rotator cuff tear]].
3.  **Laboratory Tests:**
    *   **Blood Glucose/HbA1c:** To screen for diabetes.
    *   **Thyroid Function Tests:** To screen for thyroid disorders.

### Differential Diagnosis

*   **[[Rotator Cuff Tear]]:** Usually weakness is prominent; passive ROM may be preserved unlike in frozen shoulder.
*   **[[Imingement Syndrome]]:** Painful arc of motion (60-120 degrees), but not global stiffness.
*   **[[Osteoarthritis]] (Glenohumeral):** X-ray shows joint space narrowing and osteophytes.
*   **Calcific Tendinitis:** Calcium deposits visible on X-ray.
*   **Posterior Dislocation:** Locked in internal rotation, history of trauma/seizure.

### Management

The condition is generally self-limiting, but treatment aims to shorten the course and reduce morbidity.

#### 1. Conservative Management (First Line)
*   **Counseling:** Reassurance about the self-limiting nature of the disease (usually resolves in 18-24 months).
*   **Pain Control:**
    *   [[NSAIDs]] (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).
    *   Analgesics.
*   **Physiotherapy:**
    *   Active and active-assisted range of motion exercises.
    *   Pendulum exercises.
    *   Stretching exercises to prevent further contracture.
*   **Control of Comorbidities:** Strict glycemic control in diabetics.
*   **Intra-articular Injections:**
    *   **[[Corticosteroids]]:** Potent anti-inflammatory; helpful in the painful (freezing) stage to reduce synovitis.
    *   **Hydrodilatation:** Injection of a large volume of saline and steroid to distend and stretch the capsule.

#### 2. Surgical/Interventional Management
Indicated if conservative treatment fails after 3–6 months or symptoms are severe.

*   **Manipulation Under Anesthesia (MUA):** The surgeon forcibly moves the shoulder through its range of motion while the patient is anesthetized to break adhesions. *Risk:* Spiral fracture of the humerus.
*   **Arthroscopic Capsular Release:**
    *   **Adhesiolysis:** Cutting the thickened capsule and adhesions using an arthroscope.
    *   Allows for controlled release of the rotator interval and inferior capsule.
    *   Lower risk of iatrogenic fracture compared to manipulation.
