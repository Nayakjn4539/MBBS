# Glaucoma Operations: Instrumentation and Surgical Steps

## I. Exposure and Fixation Instruments

### 1. Eye Speculums
These are used to separate the eyelids and keep them apart during the surgery to provide adequate exposure of the globe.

*   **Universal Metallic Eye Speculum:** 
    *   **Structure:** Has two limbs and a spring mechanism with a screw to adjust the limbs. The blades are open (fenestrated).
    *   **Feature:** Can be used for both right and left eyes.
    *   **Uses:** Standard for most intraocular operations, including [[Glaucoma Surgery]] and [[Cataract Surgery]].,
*   **Eye Speculum with Guard:** 
    *   **Feature:** Has solid blades to cover the eyelashes and keep them away from the surgical field.
*   **Wire Speculum (Barraquer):** 
    *   **Feature:** Very light, exerts minimal pressure on the eyeball. Useful in pediatric cases or when minimal globe pressure is desired.

### 2. Superior Rectus Holding Forceps
*   **Structure:** A toothed forceps (1x2 teeth) characterized by an **S-shaped double curve** near the tip.
*   **Function:** Used to hold the [[Superior Rectus Muscle]] while passing a **bridle suture** under it.
*   **Clinical Implication:** The bridle suture fixes the eye in **downward gaze**, which is essential for surgeries performed at the superior limbus, such as [[Trabeculectomy]].,

### 3. Fixation Forceps (Globe Fixation Forceps)
*   **Structure:** Stout forceps with 2x3 or 3x4 teeth at the tip.
*   **Function:** Applied near the [[Limbus]] to grasp the conjunctiva and episcleral tissue together.
*   **Uses:**
    *   To fixate or stabilize the eyeball during surgery.
    *   To hold the eyeball during the **Forced Duction Test** (differentiation of restrictive vs. paralytic squint).

## II. Incision and Dissection Instruments

### 1. Scalpel Handle (Bard-Parker Handle)
*   **Structure:** A flat metallic handle available in different sizes. It has a groove at the tip to fit disposable blades.
*   **Function:** Holds sterile surgical blades (e.g., No. 11, 15, or razor blade fragments).
*   **Uses:** Used for making skin incisions, conjunctival incisions, or scleral grooves during glaucoma filtration surgeries.,

### 2. Tooke’s Knife
*   **Structure:** A short flat blade with a semicircular **blunt dissecting edge** which is beveled on both surfaces (chisel-like).
*   **Uses:** 
    *   **Conjunctival Dissection:** To separate the conjunctiva and subconjunctival tissue from the sclera and limbus (creating a conjunctival flap).
    *   **Scleral Dissection:** Used to separate partial thickness lamellae of the [[Sclera]] during [[Trabeculectomy]].
    *   **Corneal Dissection:** Occasionally used in separating corneal lamellae in keratoplasty or pterygium surgery.

### 3. Conjunctival Scissors
*   **Types:**
    *   **Plain Curved Scissors (Ringed):** Fine pointed scissors with sharp cutting blades. Used to cut and undermine the [[Conjunctiva]] to create flaps (Fornix-based or Limbus-based).,
    *   **Spring Scissors (Westcott’s):** Stout scissors with spring action. Often preferred as a handy alternative to ringed scissors for undermining conjunctiva and cutting tissues.

## III. Fistulization and Tissue Removal

### 1. Elliot’s Scleracorneal Trephine
*   **Context:** Historically used for **Elliot’s sclerocorneal trephining**, a type of "Pre-filtering operation" creating a full-thickness fistula.
*   **Status:** This procedure and instrument are no longer routinely performed due to high rates of postoperative complications (e.g., hypotony, endophthalmitis).
*   **Function:** Designed to punch a circular hole (trephination) at the corneoscleral junction to allow aqueous drainage.
*   **Modern Alternative:** **Kelley’s Punch** or **Scleral Punch** is now used in [[Trabeculectomy]] to create the ostium (sclerostomy) by removing a block of trabecular tissue.

### 2. Disc-Holding Forceps (Corneo-scleral Forceps)
*   **Context:** While specific "disc-holding" forceps are not isolated in standard sets, fine toothed forceps are used to handle the tissue disc/block during excision.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Colibri Forceps:** Forceps with very fine 1x2 teeth.
    *   **Lim's Forceps:** Similar fine toothed forceps.
*   **Function:** Used to hold the corneal or scleral edge/flap during suturing or excision of the trabecular block.

## IV. Iris Manipulation Instruments

### 1. Iris Forceps
*   **Structure:** Small, delicate forceps with fine 1x2 teeth on the inner side of the limbs.
*   **Uses:** 
    *   To grasp the [[Iris]] and pull it out through the incision to perform an [[Iridectomy]].
    *   Used in operations for glaucoma, cataract, and iris prolapse repair.

### 2. De-Wecker’s Iris Scissors
*   **Structure:** Fine scissors with small blades directed at **right angles** to the arms. The blades are kept open (V-shape) by a spring action mechanism.
*   **Function:** Specifically designed for performing **Iridectomy** (surgical removal of a portion of the iris) or **Iridotomy**.
*   **Surgical Step:** After the iris is grasped with iris forceps, De-Wecker's scissors are used to excise the prolapsed knuckle of iris tissue to create a peripheral iridectomy (PI) to prevent pupillary block.

### 3. Iris Repositor
*   **Structure:** Consists of a delicate, flat, malleable, straight or bent blade with blunt edges attached to a handle.
*   **Uses:**
    *   To **reposit the iris** back into the [[Anterior Chamber]] after iridectomy or if iris prolapse occurs.,
    *   To break synechiae at the pupillary margin.

## V. Suturing Instruments

### 1. Needle Holder
*   **Types:**
    *   **Spring Action (Barraquer’s):** Fine, curved/straight tips without locks. Used for passing fine sutures (e.g., 10-0 nylon) in the cornea, sclera, and conjunctiva.
    *   **Castroviejo’s:** Medium-sized with an S-shaped locking system. Used for general intraocular and extraocular surgery.
    *   **Silcock’s / Kalt / Arruga’s:** Larger needle holders with a broad thumb plate. Used for passing the **Superior Rectus bridle suture** or lid surgery.
*   **Glaucoma Application:** Used to suture the scleral flap (usually with 10-0 nylon) and the conjunctival flap (with 8-0/10-0 nylon or vicryl) at the end of [[Trabeculectomy]].

### Clinical Summary: The Trabeculectomy Procedure
*(A Guarded Filtering Surgery)*

1.  **Preparation:** Eye speculum inserted; Superior Rectus forceps used to pass bridle suture for downward gaze.
2.  **Conjunctival Flap:** Conjunctival scissors and plain forceps used to create a fornix or limbus-based flap.
3.  **Scleral Flap:** Bard-Parker handle or Razor blade fragment creates the outline; Tooke’s knife or Crescent knife dissects a partial thickness scleral flap.,,
4.  **Ostium Creation:** A block of tissue containing the [[Trabecular Meshwork]] and [[Schlemm’s Canal]] is excised (using Kelley's punch or Vannas scissors).
5.  **Iridectomy:** Iris is grasped with Iris forceps and cut with De-Wecker’s scissors (Peripheral Iridectomy).
6.  **Closure:** Scleral flap sutured with Needle holder (10-0 nylon) to titrate flow; Conjunctiva sutured water-tight.

**Mnemonic for Glaucoma Surgery Goals:**
"**L**ower **I**OP **P**ermanently"
*   **L**ower IOP (Target pressure)
*   **I**ncrease outflow (Fistula creation)
*   **P**revent complications (Antimetabolites like Mitomycin-C)
