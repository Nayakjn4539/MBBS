# [[HEALTH INFORMATION & BASIC MEDICAL STATISTICS]] > Mention the uses of hospital records

### Uses of Hospital Records

In countries where registration of vital events is defective and notification of infectious diseases is inadequate, hospital data constitute a basic and primary source of information about diseases prevalent in the community.

The specific uses of hospital records include:

1.  **Geographic Distribution:** They provide information on the **geographic sources** of patients, helping to define the catchment area of the hospital.
2.  **Demographic Analysis:** They allow for the analysis of **[[age and sex distribution]]** of different diseases treated within the facility.
3.  **Morbidity Pattern:** They provide data on the distribution of diagnoses, helping to identify common illnesses seeking care.
4.  **Disease Association:** Records facilitate the study of the **association between different diseases** (co-morbidities) found in the same patient.
5.  **Operational Efficiency:** They provide data on the **duration of hospital stay** and the period between disease onset and admission.
6.  **Health Economics:** They provide data on the **cost of hospital care**, which is essential for financial planning.
7.  **Monitoring Utilization:** Data is used to calculate indices such as:
    *   **[[Bed-occupancy rate]]**.
    *   Bed turnover ratio.
    *   Average length of stay.
8.  **Planning:** Such information is of great value in the **planning of health care services** and allocation of resources.

### Clinical Relevance: Limitations
While useful, hospital records have specific limitations that a student must remember (The **"Tip of the Iceberg"** concept):
*   They constitute only the **"tip of the iceberg"** (only patients seeking care are counted; mild/subclinical cases are missed).
*   Admission policies vary between hospitals (selection bias).
*   The **[[population at risk]]** (denominator) cannot be precisely defined.

### Mnemonic
**"G-D A-C-P"** (Good Doctors Always Check Patients)
*   **G** - **G**eographic source of patients
*   **D** - **D**istribution of Diagnosis
*   **A** - **A**ge and Sex distribution / **A**ssociation of diseases
*   **C** - **C**ost of care
*   **P** - **P**lanning of health services
