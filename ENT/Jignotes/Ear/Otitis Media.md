# Otitis Media

## Definition and Classification
**Otitis Media (OM)** refers to the inflammation of the mucoperiosteal lining of the middle ear cleft, which includes the Eustachian tube, tympanic cavity, attic, aditus, antrum, and mastoid air cells.

**Classification:**
*   **[[Acute Otitis Media]] (AOM):** Rapid onset of signs and symptoms of inflammation in the middle ear.
*   **Otitis Media with Effusion (OME):** Accumulation of non-purulent fluid in the middle ear with an intact tympanic membrane.
*   **[[Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media]] (CSOM):** Chronic inflammation (>3 months) with a permanent perforation of the tympanic membrane and otorrhea.

---

## Acute Suppurative Otitis Media (ASOM)
Commonly seen in children; often follows a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI).

### Etiology
*   **Route of Infection:** Most commonly via the [[Eustachian Tube]] (short, wide, and horizontal in children).
*   **Organisms:**
    *   *Streptococcus pneumoniae* (Most Common).
    *   *Haemophilus influenzae*.
    *   *Moraxella catarrhalis*.

### Stages of ASOM
The disease progresses through distinct pathological stages:

1.  **Stage of Tubal Occlusion:** Edema of the Eustachian tube causes negative intratympanic pressure. **TM:** Retracted. **Symptoms:** Blocked ear, mild pain.
2.  **Stage of Hyperemia (Presuppuration):** Infection invades the middle ear. **TM:** Cartwheel appearance (radial vessels congested). **Symptoms:** Severe earache, fever.
3.  **Stage of Suppuration:** Pus formation in the middle ear under tension. **TM:** Red and bulging (yellow spot may be seen). **Symptoms:** Excruciating pain, high fever.
4.  **Stage of Resolution:** TM ruptures, pus drains. **Symptoms:** Pain and fever subside immediately. **Signs:** [[Lighthouse Sign]] (pulsatile otorrhea) may be seen.
5.  **Stage of Complication:** If virulence is high or resistance low, infection spreads beyond the middle ear (e.g., Mastoiditis).

### Treatment
*   **Medical:** Antibiotics (Amoxicillin is 1st line), nasal decongestants, analgesics.
*   **Surgical ([[Myringotomy]]):** Incision of the TM to drain pus.
    *   **Indication:** Bulging TM with severe pain, facial palsy, or incomplete resolution.
    *   **Incision:** Curvilinear (J-shaped) in the **Postero-Inferior Quadrant**.

>**Clinical Note:** **Acute Necrotizing Otitis Media** is a virulent form (usually *Beta-hemolytic Streptococcus*) seen in children with measles/scarlet fever. It causes rapid destruction of the entire TM (total perforation) and ossicles.

## Otitis Media with Effusion (OME)
Also known as **Glue Ear** or Serous Otitis Media. It is the accumulation of sterile fluid in the middle ear.

### Etiology
*   **Eustachian Tube Dysfunction:** Adenoid hypertrophy (most common in children), Cleft palate, Down's syndrome.
*   **Unresolved AOM:** Inadequate antibiotic therapy.
*   **Adult Onset:** Unilateral OME in an adult is **[[Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma]]** until proven otherwise.

### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:** Hearing loss (insidious), delayed speech in children, mild earache.
*   **Otoscopy:** Dull, retracted TM with restricted mobility. **Fluid level** or **air bubbles** may be seen behind the drum. The drum may appear blue.

### Diagnosis
*   **Pure Tone Audiometry:** Conductive hearing loss (20–40 dB).
*   **Tympanometry:** **Type B** (Flat curve) is diagnostic.

### Management
*   **Medical:** "Watchful waiting" for 3 months (decongestants/steroids have unproven benefit).
*   **Surgical:** If fluid persists >3 months with hearing loss >25dB:
    *   **Myringotomy:** Radial incision in **Antero-Inferior Quadrant**.
    *   **Grommet Insertion (Ventilation Tube):** Aerates the middle ear.
    *   **Adenoidectomy:** Often performed concurrently to remove the source of obstruction.

## Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media (CSOM)
Chronic infection of the middle ear cleft with a permanent perforation and otorrhea >3 months.

### Classification: Safe vs. Unsafe
CSOM is classically divided into two types:

| Feature | Tubotympanic (Safe/Mucosal) | Atticoantral (Unsafe/Squamosal) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pathology** | Mucosal inflammation | **[[Cholesteatoma]]** / Bone erosion |
| **Site** | Anteroinferior part of cleft | Posterosuperior part (Attic/Antrum) |
| **Perforation** | **Central** (Annulus intact) | **Attic** or **Marginal** (Annulus eroded) |
| **Discharge** | Profuse, Mucoid/Mucopurulent, Odorless | Scanty, Purulent, **Foul-smelling** |
| **Polyp** | Pale, mucosal | Red, fleshy, granulation tissue |
| **Complications** | Rare | Common (due to bone erosion) |
| **Hearing Loss** | Conductive (mild-moderate) | Conductive or Mixed |

### Cholesteatoma
*   **Definition:** "Skin in the wrong place." A sac lined by squamous epithelium containing keratin debris with the ability to erode bone.
*   **Pathogenesis Theories:**
    *   **Wittmaack’s:** Invagination of pars flaccida (retraction pocket).
    *   **Habermann’s:** Epithelial migration through a marginal perforation.
    *   **Sade’s:** Squamous metaplasia of middle ear mucosa.
*   **Bone Erosion:** Caused by enzymes (collagenase, acid phosphatase) produced by osteoclasts.

### Management
*   **Tubotympanic (Safe):**
    *   Aural toilet (dry mopping/suction).
    *   Antibiotic ear drops (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin).
    *   Surgery: **[[Myringoplasty]]** (repair of TM) or **[[Tympanoplasty]]** (TM repair + ossicular reconstruction) when the ear is dry.
*   **Atticoantral (Unsafe):**
    *   **Surgery is the mainstay** to render the ear "Safe, Dry, and Hearing".
    *   **Canal Wall Up (CWU):** Cortical mastoidectomy + Posterior Tympanotomy (Combined Approach). Higher recurrence rate.
    *   **Canal Wall Down (CWD):** **Modified Radical Mastoidectomy (MRM)** or Radical Mastoidectomy. Exteriorizes the disease cavity.

## Complications of Otitis Media
Complications occur due to bone erosion (cholesteatoma), venous thrombophlebitis, or preformed pathways. They are classified into Intratemporal and Intracranial.

### A. Intratemporal (Extracranial) Complications
1.  **[[Mastoiditis]] (Acute):**
    *   *Pathology:* Coalescence of mastoid air cells, pus under tension.
    *   *Signs:* **Ironed-out appearance** of mastoid (loss of skin creases), **Reservoir sign** (pus refills immediately after suctioning), Sagging of posterosuperior canal wall.
    *   *Abscesses:* Postauricular (MC), **Bezold’s** (Sternocleidomastoid), **Citelli’s** (Digastric/Occipital), **Luc’s** (Meatal).
    *   *Treatment:* Cortical Mastoidectomy (Schwartze operation).
2.  **[[Petrositis]] (Gradenigo’s Syndrome):**
    *   Infection of the petrous apex.
    *   **Triad:** Otorrhea + Retro-orbital pain (CN V) + Diplopia (CN VI palsy).
3.  **Facial Nerve Palsy:** Due to dehiscence of the fallopian canal or bone erosion.
4.  **Labyrinthitis:** Serous (reversible) or Suppurative (irreversible hearing loss/vertigo).

### B. Intracranial Complications
1.  **[[Meningitis]]:** Most common intracranial complication.
2.  **Brain Abscess:** **Temporal lobe** (MC) > Cerebellar. Presents with fever, headache, vomiting, and localizing signs (e.g., nominal aphasia in temporal lobe).
3.  **Lateral Sinus Thrombophlebitis:**
    *   Thrombosis of the sigmoid sinus.
    *   *Clinical:* Hectic "picket-fence" fever (chills/rigors), Griesinger’s sign (edema over mastoid emissary vein).
    *   *Tests:* **Tobey-Ayer Test** (Queckenstedt’s), **Delta Sign** (empty triangle) on contrast CT/MRI.
4.  **Otitic Hydrocephalus:** Raised intracranial pressure without abscess, often following sinus thrombosis.
