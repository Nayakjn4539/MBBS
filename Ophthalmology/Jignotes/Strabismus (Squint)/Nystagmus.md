# [[Nystagmus]]

### Definition
[[Nystagmus]] is defined as a repetitive, involuntary, rhythmic to-and-fro oscillation of the eyes. It indicates a disturbance in the mechanisms responsible for maintaining normal ocular posture and fixation (e.g., [[semicircular canals]], [[vestibular nuclei]], or visual fixational mechanisms).

---

### Classification Based on Waveform

The two primary types of nystagmus based on the velocity of movement are **Pendular** and **Jerky**.

#### 1. [[Pendular Nystagmus]]
*   **Mechanism:** The velocity of eye movement is **equal** in both directions.
*   **Appearance:** Resembles the movement of a pendulum (sinusoidal oscillation).
*   **Etiology:**
    *   Often associated with **sensory deprivation** (loss of central vision) leading to a defect in the fixation reflex.
    *   **Congenital cataract**, macular hypoplasia/scarring, [[aniridia]], [[albinism]].
*   **Direction:** Can be horizontal, vertical, or rotatory.

#### 2. [[Jerk Nystagmus]]
*   **Mechanism:** Characterized by two distinct phases:
    *   **Slow phase (Pathological):** A slow drift of the eye away from the target (defoveating movement).
    *   **Fast phase (Corrective):** A rapid saccadic movement returning the fovea to the target (refoveating movement).
*   **Naming Convention:** The direction of the nystagmus is defined by the direction of the **FAST component**.
    *   *Example:* If the eye drifts slowly to the left and jerks quickly to the right, it is a **Right Jerk Nystagmus**.
*   **Etiology:** Usually indicates a motor imbalance or vestibular dysfunction.

#### 3. Mixed Nystagmus
*   Pendular in the primary position of gaze but becomes jerky on lateral gaze.

### Physiological Nystagmus
These occur in normal subjects and demonstrate the integrity of the oculomotor system.

1.  **[[Optokinetic Nystagmus]] (OKN):**
    *   A jerk nystagmus induced by looking at moving repetitive targets (e.g., telephone poles from a moving train or a rotating OKN drum).
    *   **Pathway:** Uses smooth pursuit (slow phase) and saccadic (fast phase) systems.
    *   **Clinical Utility:** Used to test visual acuity in infants and detect malingering. Asymmetry or absence suggests a parietal lobe lesion.
2.  **[[End-point Nystagmus]]:**
    *   Fine jerk horizontal nystagmus seen at extreme positions of gaze. It is fatigable.
3.  **[[Vestibular Nystagmus]] (Physiological):**
    *   Induced by stimulating the semicircular canals (e.g., caloric test or rotation).
    *   **Caloric Test Mnemonic:** **COWS**
        *   **C**old water $\rightarrow$ **O**pposite side nystagmus (Fast phase).
        *   **W**arm water $\rightarrow$ **S**ame side nystagmus (Fast phase).

### Pathological Nystagmus

#### A. Infantile / Early Onset Nystagmus
Symptoms typically appear in the first few months of life.

| Type | Characteristics | Clinical Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Infantile Nystagmus Syndrome]] (INS)** <br> *(Formerly Congenital Nystagmus)* | • Usually horizontal and conjugate.<br>• Velocity increases during the slow phase. | • **Null Zone:** A direction of gaze where nystagmus intensity is minimal; patients adopt an **abnormal head posture** to maintain this gaze.<br>• Dampened by [[convergence]].<br>• Absent during sleep. |
| **[[Latent Nystagmus]]** <br> *(Fusion Maldevelopment Nystagmus)* | • Appears only when **one eye is covered**.<br>• Associated with [[infantile esotropia]]. | • Jerk nystagmus with fast phase towards the **uncovered** eye.<br>• Visual acuity should be tested by fogging rather than occlusion. |
| **[[Spasmus Nutans]]** | • Rare triad of symptoms. | 1. **Nystagmus:** Asymmetrical, high frequency, small amplitude (shimmering).<br>2. **Head Nodding.**<br>3. **Torticollis** (Head tilt).<br>• Usually self-limiting (disappears by age 3-8). |

#### B. Acquired Nystagmus
Usually presents with **[[oscillopsia]]** (subjective sensation of the environment moving).

**1. Gaze-Evoked Nystagmus**
*   **Type:** Slow, conjugate horizontal jerk nystagmus.
*   **Cause:** Failure of the neural integrator (leaky integrator) to hold the eye in an eccentric position.
*   **Etiology:** Alcohol, anticonvulsants (phenytoin), sedatives, cerebellar/brainstem lesions.

**2. [[Vestibular Nystagmus]] (Pathological)**
*   **Peripheral:**
    *   Jerk nystagmus, fast phase **away** from the lesion.
    *   Associated with vertigo, tinnitus, and deafness.
    *   Inhibited by fixation.
*   **Central:**
    *   Purely vertical, horizontal, or rotatory.
    *   Not inhibited by fixation.
    *   Associated with brainstem signs.

**3. Vertical Nystagmus**
*   **[[Downbeat Nystagmus]]:**
    *   Fast phase beats downward in primary gaze.
    *   **Localization:** Lesions at the **craniocervical junction** (e.g., [[Arnold-Chiari malformation]], foramen magnum compression) or cerebellum.
*   **[[Upbeat Nystagmus]]:**
    *   Fast phase beats upward in primary gaze.
    *   **Localization:** Lesions of the anterior vermis of cerebellum, medulla, or drugs (phenytoin).

**4. Dissociated / Ataxic Nystagmus**
*   Seen in **[[Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia]] (INO)**.
*   **Lesion:** [[Medial Longitudinal Fasciculus]] (MLF).
*   **Feature:** Defective adduction in the ipsilateral eye + **Abducting nystagmus** (jerk) in the contralateral eye.

**5. See-Saw Nystagmus**
*   **Description:** One eye elevates and intorts while the other depresses and extorts.
*   **Localization:** **Parasellar** lesions (e.g., [[craniopharyngioma]], large pituitary tumors), bitemporal hemianopia.

**6. [[Convergence-Retraction Nystagmus]]**
*   **Description:** Co-contraction of extraocular muscles on attempted upgaze causes the eyes to jerk into convergence and retract into the orbit.
*   **Localization:** Dorsal midbrain lesion (**[[Parinaud’s syndrome]]**).
*   **Causes:** [[Pinealoma]], vascular accidents.

**7. Periodic Alternating Nystagmus (PAN)**
*   **Description:** Horizontal jerk nystagmus that changes direction every 60-90 seconds with a null period in between.
*   **Cause:** Vestibulo-cerebellar disease.

### Nystagmoid Movements (Saccadic Intrusions)
These mimic nystagmus but lack the specific slow/fast phase rhythmic characteristics.

*   **[[Ocular Flutter]]:** Horizontal oscillations without an inter-saccadic interval; difficulty fixating after gaze change. Seen in cerebellar disease.
*   **[[Opsoclonus]]:** Chaotic, multi-directional (horizontal, vertical, torsional) saccades. "Dancing eyes." Associated with [[neuroblastoma]] or encephalitis.
*   **Ocular Bobbing:** Rapid downward deviation with slow upward drift (inverse of downbeat nystagmus). Seen in pontine dysfunction/pontine hemorrhage.
*   **[[Superior Oblique Myokymia]]:** Monocular, rapid, intermittent torsional/vertical tremors. Best seen on slit-lamp.
