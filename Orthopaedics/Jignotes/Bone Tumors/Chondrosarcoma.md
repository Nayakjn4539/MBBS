# Chondrosarcoma

### Definition
[[Chondrosarcoma]] is a malignant primary bone tumor characterized by the production of cartilage matrix by tumor cells. It is the second most common primary non-hematological malignant bone tumor (after [[Osteosarcoma]]).

### Epidemiology
*   **Age:** primarily affects adults.
    *   **Primary Chondrosarcoma:** Typically occurs in patients aged **40–60 years**.
    *   **Secondary Chondrosarcoma:** Occurs in a younger age group (20–40 years).
*   **Sex:** Males are affected more frequently than females (Ratio approximately 2:1 or 3:1).

### Classification
Chondrosarcomas are classified based on origin and location.

#### 1. Based on Origin
| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Chondrosarcoma** | Arises *de novo* in previously normal bone. |
| **Secondary Chondrosarcoma** | Arises from a pre-existing benign cartilaginous lesion, such as an [[Osteochondroma]] or [[Enchondroma]]. |

#### 2. Based on Location
*   **Central (Intramedullary):** Arises within the medullary canal.
*   **Peripheral:** Arises from the surface of the bone (often secondary to an osteochondroma).
*   **Juxtacortical:** Arises adjacent to the cortex.

#### 3. Histological Variants
*   Clear cell chondrosarcoma.
*   Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma.
*   Dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma (High-grade sarcoma arising from a low-grade chondrosarcoma).

### Anatomical Sites
It can arise in any bone formed by endochondral ossification.
*   **Flat bones (Most Common):** [[Pelvis]] (ilium, pubis), [[Scapula]], [[Ribs]].
*   **Long bones:** [[Proximal Femur]], [[Proximal Humerus]], [[Proximal Tibia]].
*   **Location within bone:** Usually involves the **metaphysis** or diaphysis.

### Clinical Features
*   **Pain:** The most common symptom. It is dull, aching, constant, and typically **worse at night**.
    *   *Clinical Implication:* Pain in a previously painless benign cartilaginous tumor (e.g., osteochondroma) suggests malignant transformation.
*   **Swelling:** A slow-growing mass or lump. It may be present for a long duration (months to years).
*   **Pathological Fracture:** May be the presenting feature.
*   **Paraneoplastic Syndrome:** Hyperglycemia may be associated.

### Pathology
#### Gross Appearance
*   The tumor is a lobulated mass.
*   **Appearance:** Bluish-grey or bluish-white, translucent, and pearly (cartilaginous appearance).
*   **Consistency:** Ranges from firm to soft/friable.
*   **Features:** Areas of **calcification** (gritty feel), mucoid degeneration, necrosis, and cystic changes are common.

#### Microscopy (Histopathology)
*   **Cartilage Matrix:** Tumor cells lie in lacunae within a chondroid matrix.
*   **Cellular Atypia:**
    *   Increased cellularity.
    *   **Plump nuclei** and hyperchromasia.
    *   **Binucleate cells:** Presence of cells with double nuclei is a hallmark feature.
    *   Giant cells are generally absent (unlike Giant Cell Tumor).

### Diagnosis and Investigations

#### 1. Plain X-ray
*   **Lytic Lesion:** Ill-defined area of bone destruction.
*   **Calcification:** Characteristic **intralesional calcification** is seen. It is described as:
    *   **Popcorn calcification**.
    *   **Fluffy cotton-wool** appearance.
    *   **Ring and Arc** or stippled/mottled appearance.
    *   **Breadcrumb** appearance.
*   **Cortical Changes:** Endosteal scalloping (erosion of the inner cortex) and cortical thickening or destruction.
*   **Periosteal Reaction:** Usually scanty or absent, unlike osteosarcoma.

#### 2. CT Scan
*   Better for defining the extent of the tumor and detecting subtle calcifications.
*   **Polka Dot Sign:** Seen on axial views.
*   Detects cortical breakthrough and soft tissue extension.

#### 3. MRI
*   Useful for determining marrow involvement (skip lesions) and soft tissue extension.
*   Helps differentiate enchondroma from low-grade chondrosarcoma.

#### 4. Biopsy
*   **Confirmatory test.**
*   **Precaution:** Biopsy must be carefully planned because chondrosarcoma is notorious for **soft tissue seeding** (implantation of tumor cells in the biopsy track). The biopsy scar must be small and placed so it can be excised during definitive surgery.

### Differential Diagnosis
*   [[Enchondroma]] (Benign, usually asymptomatic).
*   [[Chondromyxoid Fibroma]].
*   [[Osteosarcoma]] (has sun-burst appearance, Codman's triangle).
*   Bone Metastasis.

### Treatment
The primary treatment is **Surgical**. Chondrosarcomas are generally **resistant** to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

#### Surgical Management
The type of surgery depends on the grade and location:
1.  **Wide Excision / En-bloc Resection:** Preferred for most cases. Removal of the tumor with a margin of normal tissue.
2.  **Amputation:** May be required for large, aggressive tumors or recurrences where limb salvage is not possible.
3.  **Limb Salvage Surgery:** Reconstruction using endoprosthesis or bone grafts after resection.

#### Palliative Therapy
*   **Radiotherapy:** Only used for surgically inaccessible tumors (e.g., large pelvic or spinal tumors) or for palliation.
*   **Chemotherapy:** Generally not effective, but may be considered for mesenchymal or dedifferentiated variants.

### Prognosis
*   Depends largely on the **Histological Grade** (I, II, or III).
*   **Low-grade tumors:** Good prognosis (5-year survival ~70%).
*   **High-grade tumors:** Poor prognosis due to higher risk of metastasis (usually to lungs).
*   **Poor Prognostic Factors:**
    *   High grade.
    *   Large tumor size.
    *   Location in the axial skeleton (pelvis/spine).

### Mnemonics
*   **Calcification Appearance:** Think of a movie theater snack = **Popcorn** calcification.
*   **"CHONDRO"**:
    *   **C**alcification (Popcorn/Mottled)
    *   **H**ips/Humerus (Common sites)
    *   **O**ld age (40-60 years)
    *   **N**o Chemo/Radio (Resistant)
    *   **D**ull aching pain
    *   **R**esection (Wide excision is treatment)
    *   **O**rigin (Primary or Secondary)
