# The Disaster Cycle

The [[Disaster Cycle]] is a continuous, integrated process involving distinct phases that link the event of a disaster to long-term development. It implies that disaster management is not just a reactive measure but an ongoing continuum.

> The Disaster Management Cycle. Draw a circle divided into two halves. The right side represents the 'Post-Disaster/Recovery Phase' containing Response, Rehabilitation, and Reconstruction. The left side represents the 'Pre-Disaster/Risk Reduction Phase' containing Mitigation and Preparedness. The 'Disaster Impact' is the point connecting Preparedness to Response.

### Phases of the Disaster Cycle

The cycle is generally divided into two major phases relative to the disaster event:

#### A. Post-Disaster Phase (Recovery Phase)

**1. Disaster Impact**
*   The point at which the disaster strikes.
*   **Medical Focus:** Most injuries occur during the impact; the greatest need for [[Emergency Care]] is in the first few hours.

**2. Response (Relief Phase)**
*   Immediate actions taken to save lives and minimize damage.
*   **Key Medical Activities:**
    *   Search and Rescue.
    *   First aid and Field care.
    *   **[[Triage]]:** Rapid classification of the injured based on severity and likelihood of survival to assign medical priority.
    *   Tagging and Identification of the dead.
    *   **Epidemiologic Surveillance:** Monitoring for outbreaks (e.g., [[Gastroenteritis]], Leptospirosis).

**3. Rehabilitation (Restoration)**
*   Activities to restore basic services and the community to pre-disaster conditions.
*   **Priorities:**
    *   Restoration of safe [[Water Supply]] and chlorination.
    *   Basic sanitation and vector control.
    *   Food safety.
    *   Return of displaced populations (e.g., from refugee camps) to their homes.

**4. Reconstruction**
*   Long-term repair of physical infrastructure (housing, hospitals, roads) and restoration of the economy.
*   Ideally, this phase should incorporate "Build Back Better" principles to reduce future vulnerability.

#### B. Pre-Disaster Phase (Risk Reduction Phase)

**1. Mitigation**
*   Measures taken *before* a disaster to prevent hazards from causing an emergency or to lessen the likely effects.
*   **Primary Prevention:** Focuses on reducing the vulnerability of the system.
*   **Examples:**
    *   *Structural:* Building earthquake-resistant hospitals, flood levees.
    *   *Non-structural:* Land-use planning, legislation, safety codes.
    *   **Medical Mitigation:** Ensuring health facilities are safe and can remain functional during a crisis.

**2. Preparedness**
*   Long-term development activities to strengthen the overall capacity to manage an emergency efficiently.
*   **Goal:** To ensure systems, procedures, and resources are in place for a prompt response.
*   **Components:**
    *   Stockpiling medical supplies (e.g., [[IV fluids]], vaccines).
    *   Training of health personnel (e.g., in Triage and First Aid).
    *   Organizing communication and warning systems.
    *   Conducting simulation exercises (Mock drills).

### Stages of Health and Medical Relief

The response phase is clinically divided into specific timelines:

| Stage | Time Frame | Key Activities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Phase** | **0–6 Hours** | • **Search and Rescue**<br>• First Aid<br>• **[[Triage]]** and stabilization<br>• This is the "Golden Period" for saving lives. |
| **Secondary Phase** | **6–24 Hours** | • Transportation of victims to hospitals<br>• Sanitation measures<br>• Initial **[[Epidemiologic Surveillance]]** |
| **Tertiary Phase** | **1–60 Days** | • **Clean up**<br>• Provision of food, shelter, clothing<br>• Prevention of communicable diseases<br>• Social services and rehabilitation |

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Triage:** In mass casualty incidents, the principle of "First come, first served" is **NOT** followed. Priority is given to those who are most likely to survive with immediate intervention (Red Tag).
*   **Disease Outbreaks:** The most common disease reported in the post-disaster phase is **[[Gastroenteritis]]**. The most effective prevention strategy is the chlorination of water.
*   **Vaccination:** Mass vaccination is generally *not* recommended immediately, *except* for **[[Measles]]** in overcrowded camps (along with Vitamin A supplementation).

### Mnemonic
**P-R-R-M-P** (To remember the flow of the cycle)
*   **P**re-disaster (Impact)
*   **R**esponse
*   **R**ehabilitation
*   **M**itigation
*   **P**reparedness
