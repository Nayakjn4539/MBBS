# Stapedectomy and Stapedotomy

These are microsurgical procedures primarily performed for the treatment of [[Otosclerosis]] to restore hearing by addressing the fixation of the [[Stapes]] footplate.

### Definitions and Comparison

*   **Stapedectomy**: Involves the total removal of the fixed stapes footplate and replacement with a prosthesis. This technique is less commonly performed now due to higher risks.,
*   **Stapedotomy** (Small fenestra stapedectomy): Involves creating a small hole (fenestra) in the fixed footplate and placing a piston prosthesis. It is currently the preferred procedure as it is safer and preserves high-frequency hearing better.,,

| Feature | Stapedectomy | Stapedotomy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Procedure** | Removal of whole/part of footplate | Small fenestra made in footplate |
| **Trauma to Vestibule** | More | Less |
| **Risk of Perilymph Fistula** | Higher | Lower |
| **High-Frequency Hearing** | Less preserved | Better preserved |
| **Stability of Prosthesis** | Variable | More stable |
| **Current Status** | Less common | Procedure of choice |,,

### Indications and Patient Selection

Surgery is indicated when the patient suffers from [[Conductive Hearing Loss]] due to stapes fixation.

**Audiometric Criteria:**
*   **Air-Bone Gap:** Should be at least **15 dB** (preferably >25-30 dB).,,,
*   **Bone Conduction:** Normal or good cochlear reserve (0–25 dB).,
*   **Air Conduction:** Threshold should be 30 dB or worse (45–65 dB).,
*   **Rinne Test:** Negative for 256, 512, and 1024 Hz.,
*   **Speech Discrimination Score:** Should be **60% or more**.,

### Contraindications

**Absolute Contraindications:**
*   **Only Hearing Ear:** Surgery is contraindicated due to the risk of a "dead ear" (approx. 1%).,,
*   **Active Otosclerosis (Otospongiosis):** Indicated by a positive **Schwartze sign** (flamingo pink blush on promontory). Surgery should be delayed, and the patient treated with **Sodium Fluoride** to mature the focus.,,,
*   **Meniere’s Disease:** Concurrent endolymphatic hydrops increases the risk of permanent sensorineural hearing loss.,
*   **Pregnancy:** Surgery is avoided; it may be deferred until 12 months after delivery.,,

**Relative Contraindications:**
*   **Young Children:** Due to the risk of active focus and [[Eustachian Tube]] dysfunction leading to otitis media.,
*   **Occupational Hazards:** Professional athletes, divers, pilots, or high-construction workers due to pressure changes and risk of vertigo.,
*   **External/Middle Ear Infection:** Otitis externa or TM perforation (must be treated first).,

***Mnemonic for Contraindications: "ONLY SOAP"***
*   **O**nly hearing ear
*   **M**eniere's disease
*   **Y**oung children
*   **S**chwartze sign (Active disease)
*   **O**titis externa/media
*   **A**thletes/Divers
*   **P**regnancy

### Surgical Steps

The surgery is typically performed under **Local Anesthesia** to monitor hearing and vertigo intraoperatively.,,,,

1.  **Preparation and Incision:**
    *   **Incision:** **Rosen’s incision** (endomeatal) is most commonly used. It involves a curvilinear incision 6 mm from the annulus (6 o'clock to 12 o'clock).,,,,
    *   Alternatively, an **Endaural incision** (Lempert's) can be used for better access.,

2.  **Exposure:**
    *   Elevation of the **tympanomeatal flap**.,
    *   **Curetting the Bony Overhang:** The posterosuperior bony canal wall is drilled/curetted to expose the pyramid, stapedius tendon, and incudostapedial joint.,
    *   Identification and preservation of the [[Chorda Tympani]] nerve.,,

3.  **Confirmation of Fixation:**
    *   Palpation of the ossicles to confirm stapes fixation and rule out malleus fixation.

4.  **Removal of Superstructure:**
    *   Disarticulation of the **Incudostapedial joint**.,
    *   Cutting the **Stapedius tendon**.,
    *   Fracturing/cutting the posterior and anterior crura.,
    *   Removal of the stapes superstructure.,

5.  **Fenestration (Stapedotomy):**
    *   A small hole (fenestra) is created in the footplate.
    *   **Methods:** Microdrill, Hand-held perforators, or **LASER** (CO2, Argon, or KTP-532).,,,
    *   **Diameter:** Usually 0.6 mm to accommodate a 0.4 mm piston.

6.  **Prosthesis Insertion:**
    *   A Teflon piston (or Titanium/Platinum) is placed into the fenestra.
    *   The loop is crimped around the long process of the [[Incus]].,,
    *   **Sealing:** The fenestra around the piston is sealed with a vein graft, fascia, or fat to prevent perilymph leak.,,

7.  **Closure:**
    *   The tympanomeatal flap is repositioned.,
    *   External canal packed with gelfoam.,

### Types of Prosthesis

*   **Teflon Piston:** Most common.,
*   **Fisch/McGee:** Malleable ribbon-like crook with a metal/Teflon stem.
*   **Robinson:** Bucket handle type.
*   **Platinum/Titanium:** MRI compatible and lightweight.,

### Complications

#### Intraoperative
*   **Tympanic Membrane Tear:** Should be repaired with a graft (underlay).,
*   **Floating Footplate:** The whole footplate becomes mobile and difficult to perforate.
*   **Perilymph Gusher:** Profuse flow of perilymph (increased pressure). Surgery may need to be abandoned and sealed with fat.
*   **Facial Nerve Injury:** Risk is higher if the nerve is dehiscent or prolapsed over the oval window.,,
*   **Chorda Tympani Injury:** Leads to metallic taste/loss of taste.

#### Early Postoperative
*   **Vertigo:** Common but usually transient. Severe vertigo suggests labyrinthine trauma or long prosthesis.,,
*   **Sensorineural Hearing Loss (SNHL):** Can occur due to acoustic trauma or labyrinthitis.,,
*   **Reparative Granuloma:** Granulation tissue forms around the prosthesis/oval window (2–6 weeks post-op). Causes SNHL and vertigo.
*   **Facial Palsy:** Delayed palsy may occur due to thermal injury (Laser) or edema.,

#### Late Postoperative
*   **Perilymph Fistula:** Persistent leak causing fluctuating hearing loss and vertigo. Fistula test positive.,,
*   **Incus Necrosis:** Erosion of the long process of the incus due to loose/tight crimping.,,
*   **Prosthesis Displacement:** Causes conductive hearing loss.,
*   **Re-fixation:** Bony regrowth or otosclerosis progression.

### Clinical Implications

*   **Choice of Ear:** Always operate on the **worse hearing ear** first. The second ear can be operated on after 1 year if the first surgery was successful without complications.,,
*   **Laser Use:** KTP-532 or CO2 lasers allow for precise vaporization of the stapes tendon and footplate with minimal mechanical trauma, reducing the risk of a floating footplate.,,
*   **Result:** Successful surgery closes the **Air-Bone Gap** and often reverses the **Carhart's Notch** seen on the audiogram.,,
