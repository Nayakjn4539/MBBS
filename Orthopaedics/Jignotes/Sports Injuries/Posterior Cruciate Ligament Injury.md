# [[Sports Injuries]] > Posterior Cruciate Ligament Injury

# Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) Injury

### Introduction and Anatomy
The [[Posterior Cruciate Ligament]] (PCL) is the primary stabilizer of the knee against posterior movement of the tibia. It is stronger and thicker than the [[Anterior Cruciate Ligament]] (ACL) and is consequently injured less frequently.

*   **Anatomy:** It arises from the posterior intercondylar area of the [[tibia]] and attaches to the lateral surface of the medial femoral condyle.
*   **Function:**
    *   Prevents posterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur.
    *   Prevents [[Hyperflexion]] of the knee.
    *   Acts as a central pivot for rotation.

### Mechanism of Injury
PCL injuries are often associated with high-energy trauma but can occur in sports.

1.  **Dashboard Injury (Most Common):** A direct blow to the proximal tibia with the knee in a flexed position (e.g., knee striking the dashboard during a road traffic accident). This drives the tibia posteriorly.
2.  **Fall on a Flexed Knee:** An athlete falls on the ground with the knee flexed and the foot plantarflexed, driving the tibia backwards.
3.  **Hyperflexion Injury:** Forceful hyperflexion of the knee joint.
4.  **Hyperextension Injury:** Can tear both ACL and PCL (often associated with knee dislocation).

### Clinical Features
Unlike ACL injuries, PCL injuries may present more subtly, and patients might continue to walk.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   History of trauma (e.g., dashboard injury or fall).
    *   [[Hemarthrosis]] (swelling due to blood in the joint) may be mild or moderate.
    *   Posterior knee pain.
    *   Instability or a sense of "wobbling" when walking.
    *   **Specific Symptom:** Difficulty going **upstairs** (in contrast to ACL injuries where difficulty is often going downstairs).

*   **Clinical Implication:** A "pop" is heard less frequently in PCL tears compared to ACL tears.

### Physical Examination (Special Tests)

**1. Posterior Lag/Sag Sign (Godfrey Sag Test)**
*   **Technique:** Patient lies supine with hip and knee flexed to 90°. The examiner supports the heel/ankle.
*   **Observation:** In a PCL tear, the tibia "sags" or drops backward due to gravity compared to the normal side. The prominence of the [[tibial tuberosity]] is lost.

**2. Posterior Drawer Test**
*   **Technique:** Patient supine, knee flexed to 90°, foot stabilized. The examiner pushes the proximal tibia posteriorly.
*   **Result:** Increased posterior translation of the tibia compared to the uninjured side indicates a PCL tear.
*   *Note:* A fixed posterior sag can sometimes mimic a positive *Anterior Drawer Test* (pseudolaxity) because the tibia starts in a subluxated posterior position and is pulled "forward" to neutral. Always check the neutral starting position first.

**3. Dial Test (For Posterolateral Corner Injury)**
*   **Purpose:** Differentiates isolated PCL injury from combined PCL and [[Posterior Lateral Corner]] (PLC) injury.
*   **Technique:** Patient prone or supine. External rotation of the tibia is measured at 30° and 90° of knee flexion.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   Increased rotation at **30° only**: Isolated [[Posterolateral Corner]] injury.
    *   Increased rotation at **30° and 90°**: Combined PCL and Posterolateral Corner injury.

### Investigations

*   **X-rays:**
    *   Usually normal in pure ligament tears.
    *   May show **PCL Avulsion Fracture**: A bony fragment pulled off the posterior tibia (tibial spine/fovea).
    *   Used to rule out other fractures.
*   **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):**
    *   **Investigation of Choice (IOC):** Best for visualizing soft tissue.
    *   **Sagittal View:** Most useful for evaluating the continuity of the PCL.
    *   Detects associated meniscal or chondral injuries.
*   **Arthroscopy:** Gold standard for diagnosis and treatment.

### Treatment

The management depends on the severity (Grade), presence of avulsion fractures, and associated injuries.

#### 1. PCL Avulsion Fracture
*   **Management:** This is a "fracture of necessity" requiring surgery.
*   **Procedure:** Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF) using screws or suture anchors (posterior approach to the knee).

#### 2. Isolated PCL Tear (Substance Tear)
*   **Grade I & II (Partial/Minimally displaced):**
    *   **Conservative Management:**
        *   **RICE Protocol:** Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation.
        *   **Bracing:** Knee brace in extension to prevent posterior tibial sag.
        *   **Rehabilitation:** Focus on **Quadriceps strengthening**. A strong quadriceps muscle acts as a dynamic stabilizer, pulling the tibia forward and compensating for the PCL deficiency.
        *   Avoid [[Hamstring]] strengthening initially (as hamstrings pull the tibia backwards).

*   **Grade III (Complete tear/Symptomatic instability):**
    *   Operative reconstruction is considered, especially in high-demand athletes.

#### 3. Combined Injuries (PCL + PLC or Multi-ligament)
*   **Management:** Surgical Reconstruction.
*   **Technique:** PCL Reconstruction using grafts (e.g., [[Hamstring graft]] - Semitendinosus/Gracilis, or Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone graft).
*   **Approach:** Arthroscopic (single bundle or double bundle reconstruction).
