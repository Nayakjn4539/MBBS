# [[Irritant Poisons (Inorganic)]] > Chlorine and Halogens

### Halogens (Non-Metallic Irritants)

The halogens (Group 17 elements) include [[Chlorine]], [[Bromine]], [[Iodine]], and [[Fluorine]]. They are powerful oxidizing agents and act as potent irritant poisons.

---

### 1. Chlorine ($Cl_2$)

Chlorine is a heavy, greenish-yellow gas with a pungent, suffocating, bleach-like odor. It is about 2.5 times heavier than air,.

#### Source and Uses
*   **Bleaching agent:** In textile and paper industries.
*   **Water purification:** Swimming pools and drinking water treatment.
*   **Chemical warfare:** Used as a choking agent/lung irritant in WWI.
*   **Household cleaners:** Bleaching powder and liquids.

#### Mechanism of Action
When chlorine comes in contact with moisture on mucosal surfaces (eyes, respiratory tract), it forms **[[Hydrochloric acid]] (HCl)** and **[[Hypochlorous acid]] (HOCl)** (nascent oxygen).
$$Cl_2 + H_2O \rightarrow HCl + HOCl$$
*   **HCl:** Causes direct tissue corrosion and irritation.
*   **HOCl:** Unstable; releases nascent oxygen causing oxidation and cytotoxicity (protoplasmic poison).

#### Clinical Features
**Acute Poisoning (Inhalation):**
*   **Immediate:** Burning sensation in eyes, nose, and throat; sneezing, coughing, and lacrimation (tear gas effect),.
*   **Respiratory:** Choking sensation, dyspnea, chest tightness/pain, cyanosis.
*   **Severe Exposure:** Glottic spasm, severe laryngeal edema, and massive [[pulmonary edema]] (chemical pneumonitis) which is the usual cause of death.
*   **Skin:** Liquid chlorine can cause frostbite or chemical burns.

**Ingestion (Chlorine water/Bleach):**
*   Corrosion of lips, mouth, and pharynx.
*   Severe epigastric pain, vomiting (often blood-stained), and potential perforation of the stomach.

#### Fatal Dose and Period
*   **Fatal Concentration:** 1000 ppm is fatal within a few minutes.
*   **Fatal Period:** usually rapid (minutes to hours) due to asphyxia or pulmonary edema.

#### Treatment
1.  **Removal:** Move the patient to fresh air immediately.
2.  **Neutralization:** **Nebulized [[Sodium Bicarbonate]] (3.75% solution)** is theoretically beneficial to neutralize the acid formed in airways.
3.  **Airway:** Administer humidified oxygen. Bronchodilators (Beta-2 agonists) for bronchospasm,.
4.  **Eyes:** Copious irrigation with water or saline.
5.  **Steroids:** To reduce laryngeal/pulmonary edema (controversial efficacy).
6.  **Symptomatic:** Antibiotics for secondary infection.

#### Autopsy Findings
*   **Smell:** Bleaching powder odor from clothes and body.
*   **Respiratory Tract:** Mucosa of larynx, trachea, and bronchi is congested, swollen, and desquamated.
*   **Lungs:** Voluminous, heavy, edematous ([[Pulmonary edema]]), and may show patches of consolidation or chemical pneumonia.
*   **Heart:** Right-sided heart failure (Cor pulmonale) due to pulmonary resistance.

#### Medicolegal Aspects
*   Mostly **Accidental:** Industrial leaks, swimming pool chlorination mishaps, mixing household cleaners (acid + bleach releases chlorine gas).
*   **Warfare:** Historically used as a chemical weapon.

### 2. Bromine ($Br_2$)

Bromine is a heavy, dark reddish-brown volatile liquid that releases suffocating brownish fumes.

#### Clinical Features
*   **Acute Poisoning:**
    *   **Inhalation:** Irritation of eyes, nose, and throat. Spasm of the glottis (asphyxia).
    *   **Ingestion:** Highly corrosive to the GI tract.
    *   **Skin contact:** Causes deep, indolent ulcers and yellow/brown staining.
*   **Chronic Poisoning ([[Bromism]]):**
    *   Occurs due to cumulative effect of bromide salts (used previously as sedatives/antiepileptics).
    *   **Symptoms:** Anorexia, cachexia, foul breath, tremors, ataxia, and **Bromide Rash** (acneform eruption).
    *   **Psychiatric:** Delusions, hallucinations, loss of memory, and mania.

#### Treatment
*   Remove from exposure.
*   **For Bromism:** Administration of **[[Sodium Chloride]] (NaCl)**. The chloride ion displaces the bromide ion from tissues, enhancing excretion via kidneys.

### 3. Iodine ($I_2$)

Iodine consists of dark violet/black scales with a metallic luster. It sublimes into a violet vapor.

#### Clinical Features
*   **Ingestion:**
    *   **Staining:** Characteristic **yellowish-brown staining** of lips, mouth, and skin.
    *   **GI Symptoms:** Metallic taste, vomiting (vomitus is **blue/black** if starchy food is present), severe abdominal pain, and diarrhea (often bloody).
    *   **Renal:** It is nephrotoxic; causes oliguria, albuminuria, and acute renal failure.
*   **Chronic Poisoning ([[Iodism]]):**
    *   Results from prolonged intake of iodides.
    *   Features: Coryza (running nose), salivation, conjunctivitis, acneform skin rash, and wasting.

#### Diagnosis
*   **Starch Test:** Add starch solution to vomitus/gastric aspirate $\rightarrow$ turns **Deep Blue**.
*   **Sublimation:** Heating the vomitus releases violet fumes.

#### Treatment
1.  **Antidote:** **Starch solution** (rice water, gruel, flour paste). It forms insoluble blue iodide of starch. Continue until vomit is no longer blue.
2.  **Chemical Neutralization:** **[[Sodium Thiosulfate]]** (5% solution) orally reduces iodine to harmless iodide.
3.  **Supportive:** Fluid and electrolyte balance for renal protection.

#### Autopsy Findings
*   Mucosa of stomach and esophagus shows **yellowish-brown** corrosion/staining.
*   If starch was given as treatment, mucosa appears **blue**.
*   Kidneys show extensive necrosis (nephritis).

### 4. Fluorine / Hydrofluoric Acid (HF)

Though an acid, HF is discussed here as a halogen derivative. It is one of the most penetrating and insidious corrosive poisons,.

*   **Uses:** Glass etching, rust removal, semiconductor industry.
*   **Mechanism:**
    1.  **Liquefactive Necrosis:** Unlike other acids (which cause coagulation), HF causes liquefactive necrosis, allowing deep tissue penetration.
    2.  **Ion Sequestration:** Fluoride ions bind avidly to tissue **Calcium** and **Magnesium**, causing local cell death and systemic electrolyte imbalance.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Pain:** Excruciating deep burning pain, often disproportionate to visible skin injury.
    *   **Systemic:** Severe **Hypocalcemia** (Tetany, Chvostek’s sign), Hypomagnesemia, and **Hyperkalemia**.
    *   **Cardiac:** Ventricular arrhythmias (V-fib) leading to sudden death.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Copious irrigation** with water.
    *   **Calcium Gluconate:** Apply 2.5% gel topically or inject 10% solution intralesionally/intra-arterially to bind fluoride ions,.
    *   Monitor ECG and Calcium levels.
