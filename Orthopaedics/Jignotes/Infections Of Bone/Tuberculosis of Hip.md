# [[Infections Of Bone]] > Tuberculosis of Hip

### Tuberculosis of the Hip

[[Tuberculosis of the Hip]] is the second most common site of skeletal tuberculosis after the spine (accounting for approximately 15% of osseous TB cases). It primarily affects children and young adults (first three decades of life). It is almost always secondary to a primary focus in the lungs or lymph nodes,.

#### Initial Sites of Infection (Osseous Foci)
The infection usually starts in the bone (osseous) and spreads to the joint. Common sites of origin include:
*   **Acetabular roof:** Most common site.
*   **Epiphysis:** Superior subchondral portion of the femoral head.
*   **[[Babcock's triangle]]:** A triangular area in the inferomedial portion of the femoral neck (bounded by the physis, compression trabeculae, and inferior femoral neck).
*   **Greater Trochanter:** Less common.
*   **Synovium:** Primary synovial tuberculosis is rare in the hip compared to the knee.

### Pathological Stages and Deformities

The natural history of untreated TB hip progresses through distinct clinical and pathological stages, each characterized by specific deformities and limb length discrepancies,.

#### Stage I: Stage of Synovitis
*   **Pathology:** The infection reaches the synovium, causing congestion, edema, and effusion. The abundant fluid distends the joint capsule.
*   **Position of Ease:** To accommodate the maximum volume of fluid and minimize pain, the hip assumes a position of slight **Flexion, Abduction, and External Rotation**.
*   **Deformity:**
    *   Flexion.
    *   Abduction.
    *   External Rotation.
*   **Limb Length:** **Apparent Lengthening**.
    *   *Mechanism:* To bring the abducted limb parallel to the other for walking, the pelvis tilts downwards on the diseased side, creating apparent lengthening.
*   **Clinical Signs:** [[Antalgic gait]], muscle spasm, positive [[Thomas test]] (for flexion deformity).

#### Stage II: Stage of Early Arthritis
*   **Pathology:** The articular cartilage begins to be destroyed by the pannus (granulation tissue). The joint space narrows.
*   **Muscle Spasm:** Intense spasm of the powerful adductor and flexor muscles overcomes the weaker abductors and rotators.
*   **Deformity:**
    *   Flexion.
    *   **Adduction**.
    *   **Internal Rotation**.
*   **Limb Length:** **Apparent Shortening**.
    *   *Mechanism:* To bring the adducted limb parallel to the ground, the pelvis must be tilted upwards on the affected side, causing apparent shortening.
*   **Clinical Signs:** "Night cries" are characteristic (pain occurs when muscle spasm relaxes during sleep, allowing inflamed bone surfaces to rub).

#### Stage III: Stage of Advanced Arthritis
*   **Pathology:** Gross destruction of the femoral head and acetabulum. The pathological process erodes the bone.
*   **Deformity:** The deformity remains the same as Stage II but becomes more severe and fixed (fibrous ankylosis).
    *   Flexion.
    *   Adduction.
    *   Internal Rotation.
*   **Limb Length:** **True Shortening** (due to bone destruction) **PLUS Apparent Shortening** (due to adduction).
    *   *Note:* The head of the femur may subluxate posteriorly.

#### Stage IV: Stage of Advanced Arthritis with Subluxation/Dislocation
*   **Pathology:** Severe destruction of the acetabulum (specifically the superior lip) allows the femoral head to travel upwards and backwards.
*   **Wandering Acetabulum:** The femoral head erodes the acetabulum proximally and dorsally, creating an elongated socket.
*   **Deformity:** Gross flexion, adduction, and internal rotation.
*   **Limb Length:** Severe **True Shortening** due to pathological dislocation.

### Summary Table of Stages

| Stage | Pathology | Position/Deformity | Limb Length Discrepancy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stage I** | [[Synovitis]] & Effusion | **FABER**: **F**lexion, **AB**duction, **E**xternal **R**otation | **Apparent Lengthening** |
| **Stage II** | Early [[Arthritis]] | **FADIR**: **F**lexion, **ADD**uction, **I**nternal **R**otation | **Apparent Shortening** |
| **Stage III** | Advanced Arthritis | **FADIR**: Flexion, Adduction, Internal Rotation | **True Shortening** + Apparent Shortening |
| **Stage IV** | Subluxation / Dislocation | Wandering Acetabulum / Dislocation | **Gross True Shortening** |

### Radiological Classification (Shanmugasundaram’s Types)

Apart from the clinical stages, radiological appearances (specifically described by Shanmugasundaram) classify the disease pattern,:

1.  **Normal Hip Type:** Hip appears normal except for osteoporosis/rarefaction.
2.  **Travelling/Wandering Acetabulum Type:** Femoral head moves proximally and dorsally due to acetabular destruction.
3.  **Dislocating Type:** Posterior superior subluxation or dislocation of the head.
4.  **Perthes' Type:** The femoral head appears dense and collapsed, mimicking [[Legg-Calve-Perthes disease]].
5.  **Atrophic Type:** Femoral head and neck are thinned and atrophic.
6.  **Mortar and Pestle Type:** The femoral head is ground down, and the acetabulum is deep and widened.
7.  **Protrusio Acetabuli Type:** Destruction of the medial wall of the acetabulum causes the femoral head to protrude into the pelvis.

### Clinical Implications and Examination

*   **Gait:**
    *   *Antalgic gait:* Short stance phase on the affected side due to pain.
    *   *Stiff hip gait:* In late stages due to ankylosis.
*   **Muscle Wasting:** Marked wasting of thigh and gluteal muscles is a consistent feature.
*   **Cold Abscess:** Can point in the [[femoral triangle]], gluteal region, or track down the thigh.
*   **Night Cries:** A classical symptom. During the day, muscle spasm splints the joint preventing movement. At night, muscles relax, allowing the ulcerated joint surfaces to rub against each other, causing sharp pain that wakes the child.
*   **Assess Shortening:**
    *   Differentiate between supra-trochanteric shortening (due to destruction of head/acetabulum - assessed by **Bryant’s Triangle** or **Nelaton’s Line**) and apparent shortening (due to adduction deformity).

### Mnemonics for Exam

*   **Stage 1 Position:** **FABER** (Like the test, but describing position: **F**lexion, **AB**duction, **E**xternal **R**otation).
*   **Stage 2/3 Position:** **FADIR** (**F**lexion, **ADD**uction, **I**nternal **R**otation).
