# Methods of Ophthalmoscopy

[[Ophthalmoscopy]] is the clinical examination of the interior of the eye (fundus) using an optical instrument called an ophthalmoscope. It is essential for diagnosing diseases of the [[retina]], [[choroid]], [[optic nerve]], and [[vitreous]].

The primary methods of ophthalmoscopy include:
1.  **Distant Direct Ophthalmoscopy**
2.  **Direct Ophthalmoscopy**
3.  **Indirect Ophthalmoscopy**
4.  **Slit-Lamp Biomicroscopy** (with auxiliary lenses)

---

### 1. Distant Direct Ophthalmoscopy
This is a preliminary examination performed before detailed fundus evaluation.

*   **Technique:** Light is shone into the patient's eye from a distance of **20–25 cm** using a plane mirror or a self-illuminated ophthalmoscope (with '0' power lens).
*   **Observation:** The examiner observes the uniform red glow ([[Red Reflex]]) in the pupillary area.
*   **Clinical Utility:**
    *   **Media Opacities:** Any opacity in the optical media (cornea, lens, vitreous) appears as a black silhouette against the red background.
    *   **Localization of Opacity ([[Parallactic Displacement]]):** The patient is asked to move the eye up and down.
        *   **With movement:** Opacity lies **in front** of the pupillary plane (e.g., corneal opacity).
        *   **No movement:** Opacity lies **at** the pupillary plane (e.g., anterior polar cataract).
        *   **Against movement:** Opacity lies **behind** the pupillary plane (e.g., posterior lens capsule, vitreous).
    *   **Differentiation:** Helps distinguish a mole on the iris (no red reflex through it) from a hole in the iris (red reflex seen through it).
    *   **Gross Pathologies:** Can detect [[Retinal Detachment]] or intraocular tumors (grayish reflex instead of red).

---

### 2. Direct Ophthalmoscopy
This is the most common method for routine examination of the central fundus ([[optic disc]] and [[macula]]).

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Ray diagram of Direct Ophthalmoscopy showing emergent rays from patient entering observer's eye

*   **Principle:** Emergent rays from the patient's retina are parallel and brought to focus on the retina of the emmetropic observer.
*   **Instrument:** Hand-held self-illuminated [[Direct Ophthalmoscope]].
*   **Distance:** Performed as close to the patient's eye as possible.
*   **Image Characteristics:**
    *   **Virtual**
    *   **Erect**
    *   **Magnified:** Approximately **15 times** (15x) in emmetropia. Magnification is higher in myopia and lower in hypermetropia.
*   **Field of View:** Small; about **2 Disc Diameters (DD)** or **10°** at a time.
*   **Area Visualized:** Primarily the posterior pole (disc and macula) up to the equator. The periphery is difficult to see.

**Clinical Implications:**
*   Ideal for examining the minute details of the **Optic Disc** (e.g., cupping in [[Glaucoma]], swelling in [[Papilloedema]]).
*   Assessing diabetic or hypertensive changes at the posterior pole.
*   **Limitation:** It lacks stereopsis (depth perception) and provides a poor view in the presence of hazy media (e.g., [[Cataract]], [[Vitreous Hemorrhage]]).

---

### 3. Indirect Ophthalmoscopy (IDO)
This technique is essential for examining the peripheral retina and in cases with hazy media.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Ray diagram of Indirect Ophthalmoscopy showing formation of aerial image between lens and observer

*   **Principle:** The eye is made highly myopic by placing a strong convex lens in front of it. Emergent rays form a real, inverted image in the air between the lens and the observer.
*   **Instrument:** Binocular Indirect Ophthalmoscope (head-mounted) + Condensing Lens.
*   **Distance:** Performed at an **arm’s length**.
*   **Lenses Used:**
    *   **+20D Lens:** Most commonly used. Optimal balance of magnification (**3x**) and field of view (**45°**).
    *   **+14D Lens:** Higher magnification (**4-5x**), smaller field.
    *   **+30D Lens:** Lower magnification (**2x**), wider field; used for small pupils.
*   **Image Characteristics:**
    *   **Real** (Aerial image)
    *   **Inverted** (Vertically and laterally reversed)
    *   **Magnified** (2.5x to 5x depending on the lens used).
*   **Field of View:** Large; about **8 Disc Diameters** (approx. 30°–40° depending on lens).
*   **Area Visualized:** Can view the entire retina up to the **ora serrata** using **scleral indentation**.

**Clinical Implications:**
*   **Stereopsis:** Provides binocular vision and depth perception, crucial for assessing [[Retinal Detachment]] (elevation of retina) and tumors.
*   **Media Opacity:** The bright illumination allows visualization even through dense cataracts or vitreous hemorrhage.
*   **Periphery:** Essential for screening [[Retinopathy of Prematurity]] (ROP) and finding retinal tears/holes.

---

### 4. Slit-Lamp Biomicroscopy (Fundus Examination)
Combines the high magnification and illumination of a slit lamp with auxiliary lenses to view the fundus.

#### A. Non-Contact Lens Biomicroscopy (Indirect)
*   **Lenses:** High power convex lenses (**+90D**, **+78D**, or +60D).
*   **Technique:** The lens is held in front of the patient's eye while viewing through the slit lamp.
*   **Image:** **Real, Inverted,** and **Magnified**.
*   **Use:** Excellent for detailed stereoscopic evaluation of the **macula** (e.g., [[Cystic Macular Edema]], [[CNVM]]) and the optic nerve head. +90D is standard for undilated pupils; +78D offers higher magnification.

#### B. Contact Lens Biomicroscopy
*   **Lenses:**
    *   **[[Goldmann Three-Mirror Contact Lens]]:**
        *   **Central part:** Views posterior pole (30°).
        *   **Equatorial mirror (Trapezoidal):** Views equator to ora serrata (30°–73°).
        *   **Peripheral mirror (Square):** Views ora serrata to pars plana (59°–67°).
        *   **Gonioscopy mirror (D-shaped):** Views angle and extreme periphery (59°).
        *   *Image:* **Virtual and Erect**.
    *   **[[Hruby Lens]]:** A plano-concave lens (-58.6D) attached to the slit lamp. Provides a virtual, erect image of the central fundus. (Less commonly used now).

### Comparison: Direct vs. Indirect Ophthalmoscopy

| Feature | Direct Ophthalmoscopy | Indirect Ophthalmoscopy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Image** | **Virtual, Erect** | **Real, Inverted** |
| **Magnification** | High (~15x) | Low to Moderate (~2x to 5x) |
| **Field of View** | Small (~2 DD / 10°) | Large (~8 DD / 45°) |
| **Stereopsis** | Absent (Monocular) | **Present** (Binocular - Depth perception) |
| **Illumination** | Moderate | Very Bright |
| **Use in Hazy Media** | Poor view | **Good view** (Penetrates opacity) |
| **Periphery View** | Limited (up to equator) | Excellent (up to **ora serrata** with indentation) |
| **Examination Distance**| Very close to patient | Arm’s length |
| **Image Brightness** | Less | More |

### Mnemonics
*   **Direct Ophthalmoscopy:** **D**irect is **E**rect (**Virtual**).
*   **Indirect Ophthalmoscopy:** **I**ndirect is **I**nverted (**Real**).
