| Infective Endocarditis (IE) | **Most common:** *S. aureus* (acute), Viridans streptococci (subacute), Coagulase-negative staphylococci (prosthetic valve), Enterococci. **HACEK group:** *Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, Kingella.* **Others:** Enterobacteriaceae, *Pseudomonas*, *Candida*. **Culture-negative causes:** *Coxiella burnetii, Bartonella, Brucella, Tropheryma whipplei*. | Formation of bulky, friable **vegetations** on heart valves, composed of platelets, fibrin, and microcolonies of organisms. Morphology depends on the specific agent (e.g., Gram+ cocci in clusters for *S. aureus*, chains for streptococci). | - | Dependent on organism. Example: Glucosyl transferase in *S. mutans* helps in adhesion and dental plaque formation, which can lead to bacteremia. High virulence of organisms like *S. aureus* allows infection of normal valves. | **1. Endothelial injury:** Pre-existing cardiac defect or IV catheter use leads to damage. **2. NBTE formation:** Deposition of platelets and fibrin on damaged surface (nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis). **3. Colonization:** Transient bacteremia allows organisms to adhere to NBTE. **4. Vegetation formation:** Bacterial multiplication within a protective web of fibrin and platelets. **5. Metastasis:** Vegetations seed bacteria into the blood, causing emboli and distant infections. | - | Diagnosis based on **Modified Duke Criteria**. **Acute IE:** Rapid onset, high fever, attacks normal valves. **Subacute IE:** Insidious onset, low-grade fever, attacks damaged valves. **Cardiac:** New or worsened heart murmur. **Noncardiac:** Fever, chills, weight loss, splenomegaly, clubbing. **Peripheral phenomena:** Osler's nodes, Janeway lesions, subungual hemorrhages, Roth's spots. | Blood for culture. At least 2-3 sets should be collected from different venipuncture sites before starting antibiotics. For example, two sets drawn >12h apart, or three sets within one hour. | Gram stain of positive blood culture isolate. For culture-negative IE, special stains like **Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)** stain for *Tropheryma whipplei* on vegetations. | Automated blood culture systems (e.g., BacT/ALERT). Prolonged incubation (up to 1 week) may be needed for fastidious organisms like HACEK group. Requires 5-10% CO2 (capnophilic). | Identification of isolates by automated systems like MALDI-TOF or VITEK, or conventional biochemical reactions. | **Major criteria:** Positive blood culture with typical organism, or positive echocardiogram showing oscillating mass, abscess, or new valve dehiscence.  **Non-blood-culture tests:** Serology for fastidious organisms (*Brucella, Bartonella, Coxiella*), PCR for 16S rRNA from vegetations. | **MSSA:** Cloxacillin/Nafcillin. **MRSA:** Vancomycin. **Viridans streptococci:** Penicillin or Ceftriaxone. **HACEK:** Ceftriaxone. Prosthetic valve IE often requires combination therapy (e.g., adding gentamicin and/or rifampin). Duration is typically 4-6 weeks. | - |
| Acute Rheumatic Fever (ARF) | Post-infectious sequelae of Group A Streptococcus (*S. pyogenes*) pharyngitis. | Associated with rheumatogenic M-serotypes (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 6). Genetic predisposition with HLA-DR7 and HLA-DR4. | M-serotyping of *S. pyogenes*. | **M protein** of *S. pyogenes*. | Results from an upper respiratory tract infection with GAS.  **Autoimmune theory (Molecular Mimicry):** This is the primary mechanism. Antibodies produced against streptococcal antigens (specifically M protein) cross-react with host tissue antigens in the heart (valvular endothelium) and joints, leading to inflammation and damage. **Cytotoxic theory:** Direct toxicity to human heart from streptococcal toxins and enzymes. | **Streptococcal pyrogenic toxin** and enzymes like **Streptolysin O** are believed to be directly toxic to the heart. | Manifestations appear ~3 weeks after a GAS sore throat. Diagnosis is based on the **Revised Jones Criteria (2015)**. **Major Criteria:** 1. Carditis/Pancarditis (valvular damage is the hallmark) 2. Migrating Polyarthritis (large joints) 3. Chorea (Sydenham's) 4. Erythema marginatum 5. Subcutaneous nodules. **Minor Criteria:** Fever, Arthralgia, elevated ESR/CRP, prolonged PR interval. | Throat swab for culture or rapid antigen test. Serum for antibody testing. | - (Diagnosis is not based on microscopy of affected tissues). | Throat culture for GAS. | Rapid antigen test for GAS from throat swab. | **Supportive evidence:** Elevated **ASO titre** (much higher than in uncomplicated GAS infection), positive throat culture, or positive rapid antigen test. | **Treat acute infection:** Penicillin V, amoxicillin, or benzathine penicillin G. **Supportive:** Aspirin for arthritis and fever. **Secondary Prophylaxis:** Long-term penicillin prophylaxis to prevent recurrence. | No vaccine. Prevention involves timely treatment of GAS pharyngitis (primary prevention) and prophylaxis against recurrence (secondary prevention). |

Typhi* can be done using Vi-specific bacteriophages for epidemiological purposes. | **Vi antigen:** Capsular polysaccharide that covers O antigen and confers resistance to phagocytosis. **LPS (Endotoxin):** Causes fever and shock. **Type III secretion system:** Injects effector proteins into host cells to mediate uptake. | Transmission via ingestion of contaminated food/water. Humans are the only host. 1. Entry into intestinal M cells via **bacteria-mediated endocytosis (BME)**. 2. Survival and multiplication within macrophages. 3. Spread via lymphatics to bloodstream (transient primary bacteremia). 4. Dissemination to reticuloendothelial system (liver, spleen, bone marrow). 5. Multiplication in these organs, followed by sustained secondary bacteremia, leading to clinical disease. | **Endotoxin (LPS):** Released upon bacterial lysis, responsible for fever, hypotension, and other systemic effects of sepsis. | Incubation period 10-14 days. Sustained fever with a "stepladder" pattern, headache, malaise, anorexia. Relative bradycardia. Faint, salmon-colored "rose spots" on trunk/chest. Hepatosplenomegaly. Complications: intestinal perforation or hemorrhage. Chronic carriage (e.g., 'Typhoid Mary') in gallbladder. | Depends on week of illness: **1st week:** Blood, bone marrow culture. **2nd-3rd week:** Serum for serology (Widal test). **3rd-4th week:** Stool and urine for culture. | Gram-stained smear from culture shows gram-negative bacilli. | **Blood culture:** BHI broth, automated systems (BACTEC, BacT/ALERT). **Stool/Urine Culture:** Enrichment (Selenite F broth), Selective media (MacConkey, DCA, XLD). **Wilson Blair's Bismuth Sulphite Medium:** Jet black colonies with metallic sheen for *S. Typhi* (due to H₂S production). | **Kauffmann-White Scheme:** A serological classification based on Somatic (O), Flagellar (H), and Vi antigens. Serogroups are based on O antigens, serotypes on H antigens. **Molecular Classification:** Genus divided into *S. enterica* and *S. bongori* based on DNA hybridization. **Slide agglutination test** with type-specific antisera confirms serotype. | **Widal Test:** Tube agglutination detecting O and H antibodies. A fourfold rise in titer is significant. **Other antibody tests:** Typhidot test, IDL-Tubex test. **Antigen detection:** ELISA for serum/urine. **Molecular:** PCR for flagellin gene (*fliC*), *iroB*. | Empirical: Ceftriaxone or Azithromycin. Ciprofloxacin only if susceptible.

Ability to survive and multiply intracellularly. | Zoonotic diseases transmitted by arthropod vectors (ticks, mites, lice, fleas). The organisms enter the circulation, spread through lymphatics and bloodstream, and target vascular endothelial cells. This leads to vasculitis, increased vascular permeability, edema, and hemorrhage. | - | Generally present as an acute febrile illness with headache, myalgia, and a characteristic rash. The nature of the rash (e.g., centripetal vs. centrifugal) and presence of an eschar can help differentiate species. CNS involvement can cause confusion and coma ('typhus' means hazy). | **Acute phase:** Whole blood, buffy coat, or skin rash biopsy for PCR. **Convalescent phase:** Paired sera for antibody detection. | Histological examination of a cutaneous biopsy from a rash lesion can show vasculitis. Direct immunofluorescence on skin biopsies. | Cannot be cultivated on cell-free media. Isolation requires cell lines (e.g., Vero, HeLa), embryonated eggs (yolk sac), or animal inoculation. This is hazardous and requires a **BSL-3 facility**. | Speciation is primarily based on specific serology and molecular methods. **Neil-Mooser reaction** (scrotal reaction in guinea pigs) was a historical method. | **Serology (mainstay):** • Non-specific: **Weil-Felix test** (agglutination with *Proteus* strains OX-19, OX-2, OX-K). • Specific: **Indirect Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA)** is the gold standard.

| HIV/AIDS | Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 and HIV-2 (a retrovirus). | Enveloped virus with two copies of positive-sense ssRNA. Contains the enzyme **reverse transcriptase**. Key structural proteins/antigens: envelope glycoproteins (**gp120, gp41**) and core protein (**p24**). | Serotyping into HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is typed into groups (M, N, O, P) and subtypes/clades (A-K) based on sequence differences in the *env* gene. | High mutation rate of the ***env* gene** leads to extensive **antigenic diversity**, allowing the virus to evade the host immune response. Key enzymes: reverse transcriptase, protease, integrase. | Transmission via sexual contact, parenteral exposure to blood/blood products, and perinatal routes. The virus (via gp120) binds to the **CD4 receptor** and a chemokine co-receptor (**CCR5 or CXCR4**) on target cells (primarily helper T-lymphocytes, macrophages). Virus fuses, enters, and reverse transcribes its RNA into DNA, which integrates into the host genome as a **provirus**. Viral replication leads to progressive destruction of CD4+ T-cells, causing profound immunodeficiency. | - | **Natural History:** 1. Acute Retroviral Syndrome. 2. Clinical Latency (Asymptomatic). 3. AIDS-Related Complex. 4. AIDS (CD4 count <200 cells/µL or presence of an AIDS-defining illness). **WHO Clinical Staging:** • **Stage 1:** Asymptomatic, Persistent Generalized Lymphadenopathy (PGL). • **Stage 2:** Moderate unexplained weight loss, recurrent RTIs. • **Stage 3:** Severe weight loss, chronic diarrhea, pulmonary TB. • **Stage 4:** HIV wasting syndrome, opportunistic infections (PCP, cryptococcal meningitis, CMV retinitis), Kaposi's sarcoma. | Whole blood for serum/plasma (serology, viral load) or PBMCs (culture, DNA PCR). Dried blood spot (DBS) for pediatric diagnosis. | Not used for routine diagnosis. Flow cytometry is used to count CD4+ T-cells for staging and monitoring. | Virus isolation by **co-cultivation** of patient's PBMCs with uninfected donor cells. Laborious, expensive, and used for research purposes only. | RT-PCR can differentiate HIV-1 and HIV-2 and detect specific genotypes/subtypes. | **Screening:** 3rd/4th generation ELISA, Rapid/Simple tests (e.g., ICT, dot blot). **Confirmatory/Supplemental:** Western Blot or Line Immunoassay (LIA). **Nucleic Acid Tests (NAT):** RT-PCR for viral RNA (gold standard for confirmation, viral load monitoring, diagnosis in window period). DNA PCR for proviral DNA (pediatric diagnosis). **Antigen detection:** p24 antigen assay. **NACO algorithms** are used for diagnosis in India. | **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)**. Highly Active ART (HAART) is a combination of ≥3 drugs (e.g., 2 NRTIs + 1 NNRTI or 1 PI). Treatment is recommended for all HIV-infected individuals (TREAT ALL). Prophylaxis for opportunistic infections (e.g., cotrimoxazole for PCP). Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). | No effective vaccine is available due to the high mutability of the virus. Intense research is ongoing. |
