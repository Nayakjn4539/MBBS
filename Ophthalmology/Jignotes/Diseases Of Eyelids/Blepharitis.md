# Blepharitis: Squamous vs. Ulcerative

[[Blepharitis]] is a subacute or chronic inflammation of the lid margins. It is an extremely common ocular disorder that can be broadly classified based on anatomical location into **Anterior Blepharitis** (affecting the lash bearing area) and **Posterior Blepharitis** (affecting the [[Meibomian glands]]).

Anterior Blepharitis is further subdivided into two main clinical types:
1.  **Squamous (Seborrhoeic) Blepharitis**
2.  **Ulcerative (Staphylococcal) Blepharitis**

### Comparison: Squamous vs. Ulcerative Blepharitis

The differentiation between these two types is a frequent exam topic.

| Feature | Squamous (Seborrhoeic) Blepharitis | Ulcerative (Staphylococcal) Blepharitis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Etiology** | Metabolic disorder associated with **[[Seborrhoea]] of the scalp** (dandruff). Glands of Zeis secrete abnormal neutral lipids split by *Corynebacterium acne* into irritating free fatty acids. | Chronic infection of the anterior lid margin by **[[Staphylococcus aureus]]** (coagulase-positive). |
| **Symptoms** | Deposition of whitish material, mild discomfort, irritation, occasional watering, falling of eyelashes. | Chronic irritation, itching, gluing of cilia (worse in morning), mild photophobia, lacrimation. |
| **Appearance of Scales/Crusts** | **White, soft, dandruff-like scales** accumulation among lashes,. | **Yellow, hard, brittle crusts** at the root of cilia, gluing them together,. |
| **Lid Surface on Removal** | Removal of scales reveals a **hyperaemic** surface but **NO ulcers**. | Removal of crusts reveals small **ulcers** which **bleed easily**,. |
| **Effect on [[Eyelashes]]** | Lashes fall out easily but are usually **replaced quickly** without distortion. | **[[Madarosis]]** (loss of lashes), **[[Trichiasis]]** (misdirected lashes), and **[[Poliosis]]** (greying) are common due to follicle destruction. |
| **Lid Margin Changes** | Thickening and rounding of posterior border (**[[Tylosis]]**) in long-standing cases. | Red, thickened margins with dilated blood vessels (rosettes), notched/scarred margin,. |
| **Severity** | Generally less severe. | More severe with higher rate of complications. |

### Complications and Sequelae

While complications are less frequent in the squamous type, they are common and significant in ulcerative blepharitis due to the destructive nature of the staphylococcal infection and exotoxins.

**1. Lash Abnormalities:**
*   **[[Madarosis]]:** Sparseness or total loss of cilia.
*   **[[Trichiasis]]:** Misdirection of cilia rubbing against the cornea.
*   **[[Poliosis]]:** Greying of lashes.

**2. Lid Margin Defects:**
*   **[[Tylosis]]:** Hypertrophy and scarring leading to thickening of the lid margin.
*   **[[Ectropion]]:** Due to eczema of the skin and prolonged watering.
*   **Epiphora:** Due to eversion of the punctum.

**3. Associated Infections:**
*   Recurrent **[[Stye]]** (External Hordeolum).
*   Recurrent attacks of acute bacterial **[[Conjunctivitis]]**.

**4. Hypersensitivity Reactions (Staphylococcal Exotoxins):**
*   **[[Marginal Keratitis]]:** Catarrhal ulcers in the cornea,.
*   **[[Phlyctenulosis]]:** Allergic reaction of conjunctiva/cornea.
*   Toxic punctate epitheliopathy.

**5. Tear Film Disorders:**
*   Tear film instability and **[[Dry Eye]]**.

### Management

Treatment aims to control symptoms, cure infection, and prevent complications. It is often prolonged.

#### 1. Lid Hygiene (Essential for both types)
*   **Warm Compresses:** Applied for 5–10 minutes to soften crusts.
*   **Mechanical Cleaning:** Crusts and scales should be removed using cotton buds dipped in dilute baby shampoo or 3% **[[Sodium Bicarbonate]]** solution,.
*   *Clinical Implication:* In ulcerative blepharitis, antibiotic ointment should be applied *immediately* after crust removal,.

#### 2. Antibiotic Therapy
*   **Topical:** Antibiotic eye ointment (e.g., Erythromycin, Tetracycline) applied to lid margins and eye drops 3–4 times a day for ulcerative type or mixed infections.
*   **Systemic:** Oral antibiotics (Erythromycin or Doxycycline) are indicated for unresponsive cases or those complicated by hordeolum.

#### 3. Anti-inflammatory Therapy
*   **Topical Steroids:** Low potency steroids (e.g., Fluorometholone) are required if there are hypersensitivity complications like **[[Marginal Keratitis]]** or papillary conjunctivitis.
*   *Note:* In squamous blepharitis, antibiotic-steroid combination ointment is often effective.

#### 4. Supportive Treatment
*   **[[Artificial Tears]]:** To treat associated tear film instability and dry eye.
*   Treatment of associated **[[Seborrhoea]]** of the scalp (dandruff) is mandatory for squamous blepharitis to prevent recurrence.

### Mnemonics

*   **S**quamous = **S**cales (Soft, White), **S**eborrhoea, **S**afe (No ulcers).
*   **U**lcerative = **U**lcers (Bleeding), **Y**ellow crusts (Staph).
