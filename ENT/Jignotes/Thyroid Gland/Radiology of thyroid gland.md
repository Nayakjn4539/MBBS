# Radiology of the Thyroid Gland

## 1. Ultrasonography (USG)
[[High-resolution ultrasonography]] (7–15 MHz) is the **first-line** and most important imaging modality for the evaluation of the thyroid gland. It is safe, non-invasive, inexpensive, and provides excellent anatomical detail.

### Indications
*   Evaluation of a palpable [[thyroid nodule]] or goiter.
*   differentiation between cystic and solid masses.
*   Screening for non-palpable nodules in high-risk patients (history of radiation).
*   Guidance for [[Fine-Needle Aspiration Cytology]] (FNAC).
*   Monitoring response to suppressive therapy.
*   Evaluation of cervical lymphadenopathy.

### Findings: Benign vs. Malignant Features
Differentiation between benign and malignant nodules is probabilistic based on specific sonographic characteristics.

| Feature | Suggestive of Benign Pathology | Suggestive of Malignant Pathology |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Echogenicity** | Hyperechoic (bright) or Isoechoic | **Hypoechoic** (darker than surrounding strap muscles) |
| **Composition** | Purely cystic or spongiform (honeycomb) | Solid |
| **Margins** | Well-defined, smooth | Irregular, micro-lobulated, or infiltrative |
| **Halo Sign** | Present (complete, thin hypoechoic rim) | **Absent** or thick/irregular halo |
| **Calcification** | Coarse, peripheral "egg-shell" calcification | **Microcalcifications** (fine, stippled, non-shadowing; associated with [[Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma]]) |
| **Shape** | Wider than tall | **Taller than wide** (anteroposterior dimension > transverse) |
| **Vascularity** | Peripheral vascularity (Halo flow) | Central/Internal vascularity (Chaotic) |

### Specific Conditions on USG
*   **Colloid Nodule:** Often shows cystic degeneration and comet-tail artifacts.
*   **[[Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis]]:** Diffuse enlargement with multiple ill-defined hypoechoic foci (micronodules) and increased vascularity.
*   **Thyroiditis:** Diffuse hypoechogenicity.
*   **Lymph Node Metastasis:** Rounded shape, loss of fatty hilum, hyperechoic punctuations (microcalcifications), and cystic necrosis.

> **Clinical Implication:**
> While USG can stratify risk, it cannot definitively diagnose cancer. **Ultrasound-guided FNAC** is the gold standard for tissue diagnosis in suspicious nodules.

## 2. Radionuclide Scanning (Scintigraphy)
This functional imaging technique utilizes the thyroid's ability to trap and concentrate iodine (or analogs like Technetium).

### Radiopharmaceuticals Used
1.  **Technetium-99m ([[Tc-99m]]) Pertechnetate:**
    *   Most commonly used.
    *   Trapped by the thyroid but not organified.
    *   Low radiation dose, rapid imaging (20–30 minutes), less expensive.
2.  **Radioiodine ([[Iodine-123]] or [[Iodine-131]]):**
    *   Trapped and organified.
    *   **I-123:** More physiological, used for uptake studies.
    *   **I-131:** High energy, used primarily for **ablation therapy** (post-thyroidectomy) and searching for distant [[metastases]].

### Classification of Nodules based on Uptake
*   **Cold Nodule (Non-functioning):**
    *   Area of decreased or absent uptake.
    *   **Clinical Significance:** Higher risk of malignancy (approximately 10–20%). Can also be a cyst, colloid nodule, or adenoma.
*   **Hot Nodule (Hyper-functioning):**
    *   Area of increased uptake compared to surrounding tissue.
    *   **Clinical Significance:** Almost always benign (e.g., [[Toxic Adenoma]]). Malignancy risk is <1%.
*   **Warm Nodule:**
    *   Uptake similar to normal tissue.

### Other Scintigraphy Agents
*   **[[Sestamibi]] Scan:** Primarily for [[parathyroid adenoma]], but can localize parathyroid pathology within the thyroid bed.
*   **[[Metaiodobenzylguanidine]] (MIBG):** Taken up by [[Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma]] and [[Pheochromocytoma]] (useful in [[MEN syndromes]]).
*   **Gallium-67 Citrate:** Useful in detecting [[Thyroid Lymphoma]] in long-standing Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.

> **Clinical Implication:**
> Scintigraphy is **indicated only** when the TSH is suppressed (low) to rule out an autonomously functioning nodule. It is generally *not* the first-line test for a palpable nodule with normal TSH.

## 3. Computed Tomography (CT) Scan
CT provides excellent anatomical detail but has poor soft-tissue contrast compared to MRI.

### Indications
*   **Retrosternal Goiter:** To assess the extent of mediastinal extension (which USG cannot visualize due to bony shadow).
*   **Airway Compromise:** To evaluate tracheal deviation, compression, or infiltration.
*   **Advanced Carcinoma:** To assess invasion into the esophagus, great vessels, or prevertebral fascia.
*   **Lymphadenopathy:** Evaluation of deep cervical and mediastinal nodes.

### Radiological Signs on CT
*   **Calcification:**
    *   **Egg-shell/Rim:** Benign lesions.
    *   **Finely Stippled:** [[Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma]] (Psammoma bodies).
    *   **Dense/Amorphous:** [[Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma]] (Amyloid deposition).
    *   **Heavy Irregular:** [[Multinodular Goiter]].
*   **Berry's Sign:** Absence of the carotid pulse on palpation due to encasement by malignancy; CT shows the tumor surrounding the carotid sheath.

> **Clinical Implication (Contrast Warning):**
> Iodinated contrast media used in CT scans contain large amounts of inorganic iodine. This can suppress thyroid uptake of radioiodine for 4–8 weeks, potentially delaying treatment with **I-131** in thyroid cancer patients. Non-contrast CT is preferred if radioiodine therapy is planned soon.

## 4. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
MRI offers superior soft-tissue resolution without ionizing radiation.

### Utility
*   **Extent of Disease:** Better than CT for defining extrathyroidal extension into muscles and soft tissues.
*   **Signal Characteristics:**
    *   **T1 Weighted:** Thyroid has intermediate to high signal intensity.
    *   **T2 Weighted:** Pathologic lesions (cancer, inflammation) usually have higher signal intensity (bright).
*   **Recurrence:** Differentiating post-radiation fibrosis from recurrent tumor.

## 5. Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
Utilizes **18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)** to detect metabolic activity.

### Indications
*   **Post-treatment Surveillance:** To detect recurrence in thyroid cancer patients with elevated [[Thyroglobulin]] but negative Whole Body Iodine Scans (Tenis Syndrome: Thyroglobulin Elevated Negative Iodine Scan).
*   **Incidentalomas:** Focal FDG uptake in the thyroid found incidentally during PET for other cancers carries a high risk of malignancy (up to 40%) and requires FNAC.
*   **[[Anaplastic Carcinoma]] and Lymphoma:** Staging and monitoring response to therapy.

## 6. Plain Radiography (X-Ray)
Largely superseded by cross-sectional imaging but may show:
*   **Neck (AP and Lateral):**
    *   Soft tissue mass.
    *   Tracheal deviation or compression (narrowing).
    *   Calcifications (Psammoma bodies in papillary carcinoma).
    *   Cervical osteophytes (to rule out other causes of dysphagia).
*   **Chest X-Ray:**
    *   Retrosternal extension (mediastinal widening).
    *   Pulmonary metastases ("Cannon-ball" opacities in [[Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma]] or "Snowstorm" appearance in Papillary carcinoma).

### Mnemonic for Malignant USG Features
**"HARD"**
*   **H**ypoechoic
*   **A**bsent Halo
*   **R**agged (irregular) margins
*   **D**eposits of Calcium (Microcalcifications)
