# [[Poliomyelitis]] and Post-Polio Residual Paralysis ([[PPRP]])

### Definition and Epidemiology
[[Poliomyelitis]] is an acute infectious viral disease caused by the **Poliovirus** (an Enterovirus of the Picornaviridae family). It specifically targets the **[[Anterior Horn Cells]]** of the spinal cord and the brainstem, leading to flaccid paralysis. While the acute infection is self-limiting, the sequelae causing permanent disability is termed **[[Post-Polio Residual Paralysis]] (PPRP)**.

*   **Causative Agent:** Poliovirus Types 1 (Brunhilde - most common/severe), 2 (Leon), and 3 (Lansing).
*   **Transmission:** Feco-oral route or droplet infection.
*   **Target Tissue:** [[Anterior Horn Cells]] (Motor neurons) in the spinal cord and brainstem. Sensory nerves are **spared**.

### Pathogenesis
1.  **Entry:** Virus enters via the alimentary tract.
2.  **Viremia:** Multiplies in lymphoid tissue (Peyer's patches) $\rightarrow$ Bloodstream.
3.  **Neural Invasion:** Crosses the blood-brain barrier to reach the CNS.
4.  **Neuronal Destruction:** Chromatolysis and destruction of [[Anterior Horn Cells]].
5.  **Wallerian Degeneration:** Peripheral nerves degenerate, leading to muscle atrophy (flaccid paralysis).
6.  **Recovery:** Some neurons recover; adjacent neurons may send sprouts (re-innervation), but dead neurons are replaced by gliosis.

**Clinical Implication:** Since the damage is to the Anterior Horn Cell, the paralysis is of the **[[Lower Motor Neuron]] (LMN)** type. It is characteristically **asymmetrical** and **patchy**.

### Clinical Stages of Poliomyelitis

The disease course is divided into distinct stages pertinent to management.

| Stage | Duration | Pathophysiology & Features | Treatment Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Acute Stage** | 0–4 weeks | Fever, headache, neck rigidity, muscle tenderness. **Paralysis** sets in. | Rest, isolation, prevent contractures (splinting), analgesics. **No massage/injections.** |
| **2. Convalescent Stage** | 4 weeks – 2 years | Recovery of reversible neuronal damage. Muscle power returns (max recovery in first 6 months). | Physiotherapy, muscle charting, preventing deformities with orthoses. |
| **3. Residual Stage (PPRP)** | > 2 years | No further neural recovery. Permanent paralysis and fixed deformities. | **Surgical reconstruction**, tendon transfers, osteotomies, rehabilitation. |

### Post-Polio Residual Paralysis (PPRP): Clinical Features

In the residual stage, the patient presents with the sequelae of the initial infection.

#### 1. General Signs (LMN Lesion)
*   **Flaccid Paralysis:** Loss of muscle tone.
*   **Asymmetrical Involvement:** One limb may be severely affected while the other is normal. Lower limbs are affected more than upper limbs (Quadriparesis is rare).
*   **Muscle Wasting:** Severe atrophy of involved muscle groups.
*   **Reflexes:** Deep tendon reflexes are **absent** or diminished. Superficial reflexes are usually intact.
*   **Sensation:** **Intact**. (This is a key differentiator from other neurological conditions).
*   **Autonomic Changes:** The limb is often cold, blue (cyanosed), and may have chilblains due to vasomotor stasis.

#### 2. Pattern of Deformities
Deformities arise due to **Muscle Imbalance** (strong muscles pulling against weak/paralyzed ones), gravity, and posture.

**A. Hip Deformities**
*   **Flexion-Abduction-External Rotation (FABER):** Caused by contracture of the [[Iliotibial Band]] (IT Band) and Tensor Fascia Lata (TFL).
*   **Gluteus Maximus Lurch:** Patient leans the trunk backward at heel strike to lock the hip in extension if extensors are weak.
*   **Gluteus Medius Lurch (Trendelenburg Gait):** Patient leans laterally over the affected hip.

**B. Knee Deformities**
*   **Flexion Contracture:** Due to tight hamstrings or IT band.
*   **Genu Valgum (Knock knees):** Often associated with IT band contracture.
*   **Genu Recurvatum (Hyperextension):** Due to weak quadriceps; the patient locks the knee in hyperextension to bear weight.
*   **Triple Deformity of the Knee:** A combination of:
    1.  Flexion
    2.  Valgus
    3.  External Rotation of the Tibia (Posterior subluxation of tibia may also occur).

**C. Foot and Ankle Deformities**
*   **[[Equinovarus]] (Clubfoot):** Most common. Due to weak peroneals and dorsiflexors.
*   **Equinus:** Tight tendo-achilles.
*   **Calcaneovalgus:** Weak gastrocnemius/soleus.
*   **Claw Toes:** Hyperextension at MTP joints and flexion at IP joints.

**D. Spinal Deformities**
*   **[[Paralytic Scoliosis]]:** Long C-shaped curve due to asymmetrical paralysis of trunk muscles.

**E. Limb Length Discrepancy**
*   The paralyzed limb undergoes trophic changes and grows slower than the normal limb, leading to **shortening**.

### Clinical Examination Highlights
*   **Gait:** Hand-on-Knee Gait (Quadriceps gait). The patient pushes the thigh backward with the hand to lock the knee in extension during the stance phase because the quadriceps is paralyzed.
*   **Tripod Sign:** Patient sits with hands supporting behind the back due to weak spinal muscles.

### Diagnosis and Differential Diagnosis

**Diagnosis:** Primarily clinical in the residual stage (Asymmetrical flaccid paralysis + Intact sensation + History of febrile illness).

**Differential Diagnosis Table:**

| Feature | [[Poliomyelitis]] | [[Guillain-Barre Syndrome]] | [[Cerebral Palsy]] | [[Spina Bifida]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Paralysis Type** | Flaccid (LMN) | Flaccid (LMN) | Spastic (UMN) | Flaccid/Spastic |
| **Symmetry** | **Asymmetrical** | Symmetrical (Ascending) | Often symmetrical | Symmetrical |
| **Sensation** | **Intact** | Impaired (Glove & Stocking) | Intact | **Lost** |
| **Reflexes** | Absent | Absent | **Exaggerated** | Absent |
| **Progression** | Static (after acute phase) | Improves | Static | Deteriorates with growth |

### Management of PPRP

Treatment in the residual stage aims to correct deformity, restore muscle balance, and stabilize joints for function.

#### 1. Conservative Management
*   **Physiotherapy:** Passive stretching to prevent contractures.
*   **Orthoses (Calipers):**
    *   **AFO (Ankle Foot Orthosis):** For foot drop.
    *   **KAFO (Knee Ankle Foot Orthosis):** For quadriceps paralysis (to prevent buckling).
    *   **HKAFO (Hip Knee Ankle Foot Orthosis):** For hip instability.

#### 2. Surgical Management
Surgery is indicated for fixed deformities or to improve function. It is usually performed **after** the recovery phase (after 2 years).

**A. Soft Tissue Procedures**
*   **Tendon Transfers:** Moving a functioning tendon to replace a paralyzed one.
    *   *Prerequisites:* Passive joint mobility must be full; Donor muscle must have power > Grade 4.
    *   *Example:* **Modified Jones Transfer** for claw toe (EHL transferred to metatarsal neck).
    *   *Example:* Tibialis Posterior transfer for foot drop.
*   **Contracture Release:**
    *   **Soutter’s Release:** For hip flexion contracture (releasing muscles from ASIS).
    *   **Yount’s Release:** Division of IT band and TFL for hip abduction/knee valgus deformity.
    *   **Steindler’s Release:** For pes cavus (plantar fascia release).

**B. Bony Procedures**
*   **Osteotomy:** To correct bony angulation.
    *   *Example:* Supracondylar extension osteotomy for flexion contracture of the knee.
*   **Arthrodesis (Joint Fusion):** For stabilizing flail joints (usually performed after skeletal maturity, >10-12 years).
    *   *Example:* **[[Triple Arthrodesis]]** (Fusion of Subtalar, Talonavicular, and Calcaneocuboid joints) for unstable valgus/varus foot deformities.
    *   *Example:* Grice-Green Extra-articular arthrodesis (for children <10 years).
*   **Limb Lengthening:** For significant shortening (>3-4 cm) using [[Ilizarov Fixator]].

### Mnemonics
*   **FABER** (Hip Deformity): **F**lexion, **AB**duction, **E**xternal **R**otation.
*   **Triple Deformity** of Knee: **FVE** (like Five) - **F**lexion, **V**algus, **E**xternal Rotation.
