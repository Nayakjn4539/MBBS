# Fractures of Nasal Bone and Le Fort Fractures

## I. Fractures of Nasal Bone

**Epidemiology and Etiology**
*   The [[Nasal Bone]] is the most common fractured bone in the face and the third most common fracture of the human skeleton (after clavicle and wrist) due to its prominent projection.
*   **Common Causes:** Road traffic accidents, sports injuries, interpersonal violence (assaults), and falls,.

### Classification of Nasal Fractures

#### A. Based on Direction of Force
| Type of Fracture | Mechanism | Pathophysiology | Deformity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Depressed Fracture** | **Frontal Blow** | Lower nasal bones (thinner) give way. Can cause "Open Book" fracture (septum collapses, bones splay out). | Flattening and widening of the nasal dorsum (Saddle deformity). |
| **Angulated Fracture** | **Lateral Blow** | Unilateral depression of the nasal bone on the side of injury or fracture of both bones and septum. | Deviation of the nasal bridge ("Crooked nose"). |

#### B. Based on Severity (Stranc's Classification)
*   **Class I (Mild):** Involves only nasal bones and septum (lower part). Minimal deformity.
*   **Class II (Moderate):** Involves frontal process of [[Maxilla]], septal structures; intact ethmoid.
*   **Class III (Severe):** Also known as **Naso-Orbito-Ethmoid (NOE) Fracture**. Involves nasal bones, perpendicular plate of [[Ethmoid]], [[Cribriform Plate]], and lamina papyracea. Result: **"Pig-like"** appearance (depressed bridge, upturned tip) and [[Telecanthus]].

#### C. Associated Septal Fractures,,
Often ignored but crucial for long-term function.
1.  **Jarjavay Fracture:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Blow from the **front**.
    *   **Pattern:** **Horizontal** fracture starting above the anterior nasal spine, running backwards just above the junction of the septal cartilage and [[Vomer]].
2.  **Chevallet Fracture:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Blow from **below**.
    *   **Pattern:** **Vertical** fracture running from the anterior nasal spine upwards to the junction of bony and cartilaginous dorsum.

### Clinical Features
*   **Epistaxis:** Almost always present due to mucosal tears.
*   **Swelling:** Appears within hours, often obscuring the deformity.
*   **Deformity:** Depression or deviation.
*   **Periorbital Ecchymosis:** "Raccoon eyes" or "Black eye" due to bleeding into loose areolar tissue.
*   **Crepitus:** Bony grating sensation on palpation.
*   **Tenderness** over the nasal bridge.
*   **Nasal Obstruction:** Due to septal deviation, edema, or [[Septal Hematoma]].

**Clinical Implication:** Always rule out **[[Septal Hematoma]]** (boggy swelling on the septum). If missed, it leads to septal abscess, cartilage necrosis, and saddle nose deformity,.

### Diagnosis
*   **Clinical Examination:** The gold standard. Palpation helps distinguish bony deformity from edema.
*   **Radiology:**
    *   **X-rays (Lateral view, Waters' view):** Limited utility; old fractures may mimic new ones. Vascular grooves may be mistaken for fracture lines,. Used mainly for medicolegal documentation.
    *   **CT Scan:** Indicated if associated facial fractures (e.g., NOE, Le Fort) or [[Cerebrospinal Fluid Rhinorrhea]] are suspected.

### Management

**1. Timing of Reduction**
*   **Immediate:** Before significant edema develops (within 2–3 hours).
*   **Delayed:** If edema is present, wait **5–7 days** for swelling to subside to accurately assess deformity,.
*   **Limit:** Reduction is difficult after **2–3 weeks** due to callus formation/healing.

**2. Closed Reduction**
*   Performed under Local Anesthesia (LA) or General Anesthesia (GA).
*   **Instruments:**
    *   **[[Walsham's Forceps]]:** Used to disimpact and reduce the **bony** fragments (nasal bone),. The blade is protected with rubber tubing to prevent skin injury.
    *   **[[Asch's Forceps]]:** Used to straighten and reduce the **septal** fracture.
*   **Procedure:** Fragments are disimpacted, realigned, and molded digitally.
*   **Splinting:** Internal nasal packing (to support fragments/control bleeding) and external splint (Plaster of Paris or thermoplastic) for 7–10 days.

**3. Open Reduction**
*   **Indications:** Failed closed reduction, extensive comminution, malunited fractures (presented late >3 weeks).
*   **Procedure:** [[Septorhinoplasty]] or Rhinoplasty after age 17-18 years.

## II. Le Fort Fractures (Maxillary Fractures)

**Definition**
Fractures of the midface involving the [[Maxilla]] and surrounding structures. Classified by **Rene Le Fort** (1901) based on lines of weakness in the facial skeleton. Usually result from high-velocity trauma (RTA).

### Classification

#### 1. Le Fort I (Transverse Fracture / Guérin’s Fracture)
*   **Fracture Line:** Runs horizontally above the floor of the nasal cavity.
*   **Structures Involved:** Passes through the nasal septum, lower maxilla (above teeth apices), and pterygoid plates.
*   **Clinical Feature:** **"Floating Palate"**. The hard palate and alveolar arch move separately from the rest of the face.
*   **Symptoms:** Malocclusion, loose teeth, ecchymosis in the buccal vestibule (Guerin's sign).

#### 2. Le Fort II (Pyramidal Fracture)
*   **Fracture Line:** Starts at the nasal bridge (nasion), runs laterally through the [[Lacriform Bone]], floor of the [[Orbit]], infraorbital rim, and down through the zygomaticomaxillary suture. Posteriorly involves pterygoid plates.
*   **Structures Involved:** Nasal bones, maxilla, orbital floor.
*   **Clinical Feature:** **"Floating Maxilla"** or **"Hanging Maxilla"**. The midface (nose + maxilla) is separated from the cranium and zygoma.
*   **Symptoms:** Step deformity at infraorbital margin, infraorbital nerve anesthesia (cheek numbness), epistaxis, possible [[Cerebrospinal Fluid Rhinorrhea]].

#### 3. Le Fort III (Craniofacial Dysjunction)
*   **Fracture Line:** Runs high transversely. Starts at nasofrontal suture, runs through the medial orbital wall, superior orbital fissure, lateral orbital wall, and **zygomaticofrontal suture**. Finally breaks the zygomatic arch.
*   **Structures Involved:** Disconnects the entire facial skeleton from the cranial base.
*   **Clinical Feature:** **"Floating Face"**. The entire face (including zygomas) moves relative to the cranium.
*   **Symptoms:** Dish-face deformity (elongated/flattened face), severe edema (ballooning), bilateral periorbital ecchymosis (raccoon eyes), CSF rhinorrhea, malocclusion (anterior open bite),.

### Comparison Table: Le Fort Fractures

| Feature | Le Fort I | Le Fort II | Le Fort III |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Common Name** | Transverse / Guérin | Pyramidal | Craniofacial Dysjunction |
| **Key Sign** | Floating Palate | Floating Maxilla | Floating Face |
| **Shape** | Horizontal | Pyramid | High Transverse |
| **Orbital Involvement** | No | Floor of Orbit | Floor + Lateral Wall |
| **Zygoma Involved** | No | No | Yes (Arch broken) |
| **CSF Rhinorrhea** | Rare | Possible | Common |

### Management of Midface Fractures

**1. Emergency Management (ABC)**
*   **Airway:** Clear obstruction (blood clots, loose teeth, tongue fall). Intubation or [[Tracheostomy]] if indicated.
*   **Hemorrhage:** Maxillary artery injury can be life-threatening. Anterior/Posterior packing or embolization.
*   **C-Spine:** Stabilize cervical spine until injury is ruled out.

**2. Definitive Management**
*   **Investigation:** **CT Scan** (axial and coronal with 3D reconstruction) is the modality of choice.
*   **Goal:** Restore occlusion (bite) and facial height/projection.
*   **Surgical Repair:**
    *   **ORIF (Open Reduction and Internal Fixation):** Using titanium mini-plates and screws.
    *   **Intermaxillary Fixation (IMF):** Wiring the upper and lower teeth together to restore occlusion (usually for 4-6 weeks).
    *   **Approach:** Fractures are exposed via sublabial incisions (intraoral) or coronal incisions (for Le Fort III).

### Clinical Mnemonics

*   **Le Fort Classification Levels:**
    *   **Le Fort I:** **S**peak no evil (Mouth/Palate level)
    *   **Le Fort II:** **S**ee no evil (Eye/Orbit level)
    *   **Le Fort III:** **H**ear no evil (Ear/Zygomatic arch level)

*   **Mandibular Fracture Sites (Frequency):**
    *   **C**ondyle (Most common)
    *   **A**ngle
    *   **B**ody
    *   **S**ymphysis
    *   *(Remember: **CABS**)*.
