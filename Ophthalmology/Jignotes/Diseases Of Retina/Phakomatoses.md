# Phakomatoses (Neurocutaneous Syndromes)

[[Phakomatoses]] are a group of hereditary conditions, typically transmitted via **Autosomal Dominant** inheritance, characterized by the development of hamartomas (benign tumor-like malformations) involving the **eye, skin, and central nervous system**.

### 1. Neurofibromatosis (von Recklinghausen's Disease)

This condition is characterized by multiple tumors in the skin, nervous system, and other organs. It is divided into two distinct types.

#### Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF-1)
This is the most common phakomatosis.
*   **Ocular Manifestations:**
    *   **Lisch Nodules:** Melanocytic hamartomas of the iris. These are bilateral, multiple, well-defined, dome-shaped gelatinous elevations. They are **pathognomonic** of NF-1.
    *   **Eyelid:** Plexiform neurofibromas (bag of worms consistency), often causing mechanical ptosis or S-shaped lid deformity.
    *   **Cornea:** Prominent corneal nerves.
    *   **Optic Nerve:** [[Optic Nerve Glioma]] (Pilocytic astrocytoma). Occurs in the first decade of life.
    *   **Uvea:** Congenital [[ectropion uveae]], Choroidal hamartomas.
    *   **Glaucoma:** [[Congenital glaucoma]] may occur (rare).
*   **Systemic Features:**
    *   **Café-au-lait spots:** Pigmented skin patches.
    *   **Neurofibromata:** Cutaneous tumors.

#### Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF-2)
*   **Ocular Manifestations:**
    *   **Lens:** Juvenile [[Posterior Subcapsular Cataract]] (PSC).
    *   **Retina:** Combined hamartomas of the retina and [[Retinal Pigment Epithelium]] (RPE).
*   **Systemic Features:** Bilateral acoustic neuromas (Vestibular Schwannomas).

**Clinical Implication:** In a child presenting with proptosis and visual loss, always examine the skin for café-au-lait spots to rule out Optic Nerve Glioma associated with NF-1.

### 2. Tuberous Sclerosis (Bourneville's Disease)

Also known as **Epiloia**. It is a multisystem disorder characterized by the classical triad of **Adenoma Sebaceum, Mental Retardation, and Epilepsy**.

#### Retinal Findings
*   **Retinal Astrocytomas (Astrocytic Hamartomas):**
    *   These arise from astrocytes within the retinal nerve fiber layer.
    *   They are bilateral in 15% of cases and often multifocal.
    *   **Morphological Types:**
        1.  **Flat Lesions:** Relatively flat, soft, white or grey lesions, usually seen at the posterior pole.
        2.  **Nodular Tumors:** Large, calcified tumors often located near the optic disc.
    *   **Appearance:**
        *   **Early:** Semi-translucent/white patches.
        *   **Late:** Dense white color with multiple areas of calcification giving a **Mulberry-like appearance** (Mulberry tumor).

#### Other Ocular Findings
*   **Iris:** Hypopigmented iris spots (Ash-leaf spots of the iris).

### 3. Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) Syndrome (Angiomatosis Retinae)

A rare condition affecting males more than females, usually presenting in the 3rd or 4th decade.

#### Retinal Findings
*   **Capillary Hemangioma:** The hallmark lesion is [[Capillary Hemangioma]] of the retina and optic nerve.
*   **Clinical Course:**
    1.  **Vascular Changes:** Vascular dilatation, tortuosity, and aneurysm formation (miliary to balloon-like).
    2.  **Exudation:** Massive subretinal exudation and hemorrhages occur, eventually resembling **[[Coats' Disease]]** (Exudative Retinopathy).
    3.  **Complications:** Massive exudation frequently leads to **Exudative Retinal Detachment**.
*   **Appearance:** Reddish, vascular tumor fed by a dilated, tortuous artery and drained by a dilated, tortuous vein.

#### Systemic Associations
*   **Hemangioblastoma:** Cerebellum, medulla, pons, or spinal cord.
*   **Visceral Lesions:** Cysts of the kidney, pancreas, liver, ovary, and lungs.
*   **Tumors:** Renal cell carcinoma and [[Pheochromocytoma]].

**Treatment:** Early destruction of angiomas using **Laser Photocoagulation** or **Cryopexy** to prevent retinal detachment.

### 4. Sturge-Weber Syndrome (Encephalofacial Angiomatosis)

A congenital, non-hereditary disorder characterized by angiomatosis involving the face, choroid, and leptomeninges.

#### The Classic Triad
1.  **Nevus Flammeus (Port-Wine Stain):** Capillary hemangioma on the face (usually along the distribution of the Trigeminal nerve).
2.  **Intracranial Hemangioma:** Leptomeningeal angiomas leading to seizures/calcification.
3.  **Glaucoma.**

#### Ocular Manifestations
*   **Choroid:** **Diffuse [[Choroidal Hemangioma]].**
    *   This causes a diffuse deep red discoloration of the fundus, often described as a **"Tomato Ketchup" fundus**.
    *   It typically manifests in the same eye as the facial nevus.
*   **Glaucoma:** Occurs in **50% of cases**.
    *   **Mechanism:** Raised episcleral venous pressure or developmental angle anomaly (Trabeculodysgenesis).
    *   It can present as Buphthalmos (if onset is early) or juvenile glaucoma.
