# [[GENETICS & HEALTH & MENTAL HEALTH]] > Mental Health Services are coming forefront

### **Mental Health Services: Emerging as a Priority**

Mental health is no longer a peripheral issue; it has moved to the **forefront** of public health planning due to the massive global burden of disease, the shift from infectious to chronic lifestyle diseases, and the recognition of the **biopsychosocial** nature of health.

---

### **1. The Rationale: Why are Mental Health Services at the Forefront?**

The shift in focus towards mental health is driven by the following factors:

*   **Definition of Health:** The [[WHO]] definition of health explicitly includes **"mental well-being"** alongside physical and social well-being. It is not merely the absence of infirmity.
*   **Burden of Disease:** Mental disorders account for **13%** of the global burden of disease. [[Depression]] alone accounts for 4.3% of the global burden and is among the largest causes of disability worldwide.
*   **Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY):** Mental illnesses, specifically **Unipolar Depressive Disorders**, are the leading cause of [[DALYs]] lost in the non-communicable disease category.
*   **Prevalence:** In India, the mental morbidity is estimated at **18-20 per 1000** population. Nearly **150 million Indians** are in need of mental health services.
*   **Changing Demographics:** Industrialization, urbanization, and the breakup of the **joint family system** have increased stress, leading to a rise in geriatric psychiatric problems, juvenile delinquency, and alcohol/drug abuse.

> **Clinical Relevance:** As a future clinician, remember that **20%** of all patients attending general health facilities have underlying psychological symptoms (e.g., vague aches, fatigue) rather than pure organic disease. Always rule out depression in patients with "medically unexplained symptoms."

### **2. Evolution of Mental Health Care**

The approach to mental health has undergone three major revolutions:
1.  **First Revolution:** The **Humane Approach** (unchaining the mentally ill), led by Philippe Pinel.
2.  **Second Revolution:** The **Psychodynamic Approach** (Psychoanalysis), led by Sigmund Freud.
3.  **Third Revolution (Current Era):** **[[Community Psychiatry]]**. This implies moving away from custodial care in mental hospitals (asylums) to care within the community.

### **3. National Mental Health Programme (NMHP)**

The Government of India launched the NMHP in **1982** to integrate mental health with general health services.

#### **Objectives of NMHP**
*   **Availability:** Ensure minimum mental healthcare for all, especially the vulnerable.
*   **Application:** Encourage the application of mental health knowledge in general healthcare.
*   **Participation:** Promote **community participation** in mental health development and self-help.

#### **Strategies**
*   Integration of mental health with [[Primary Health Care (PHC)]].
*   Provision of tertiary care institutions for treatment.
*   Eradicating stigmatization and protecting rights through regulatory institutions.

### **4. District Mental Health Programme (DMHP)**

To implement the NMHP at the grassroots level, the **District Mental Health Programme** was launched (based on the Bellary Model) in 1996. It serves as the functional unit of implementation.

**Components of DMHP:**
1.  **Training:** Training of all health workers (Medical Officers, MPWs) in the mental health team.
2.  **Public Education:** To increase awareness and reduce stigma.
3.  **Service Provision:** Early detection and treatment (OPD and Indoor) at the district level.
4.  **Data Generation:** Collecting data for future planning.

### **5. Levels of Prevention in Mental Health**

Mental health services are not just curative; they encompass the entire spectrum of prevention.

| Level of Prevention | Goal | Interventions/Services |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Prevention** | Prevent onset of illness | • **Personality Development:** Child guidance, school health.<br>• **Family Life:** Strengthening family bonds.<br>• **Social Welfare:** Education, job opportunities to reduce stress. |
| **Secondary Prevention** | Early diagnosis & Treatment | • **Screening:** Early detection in schools and communities.<br>• **Treatment:** At PHC/CHC levels using essential psychotropic drugs.<br>• **Crisis Intervention:** Suicide prevention helplines. |
| **Tertiary Prevention** | Reduce disability & Rehab | • **Occupational Therapy:** Skills training.<br>• **Half-way Homes:** Transition from hospital to society.<br>• **Rehabilitation:** Restoring social functioning. |

### **6. The Mental Healthcare Act, 2017**

This Act is a landmark shift bringing rights-based services to the forefront.
*   **Decriminalization of Suicide:** Attempting suicide is no longer a crime; it is viewed as a sign of severe stress requiring care, not punishment.
*   **Right to Access:** Every person has a right to access mental healthcare services run or funded by the government.
*   **Prohibition of Cruelty:** Banes inhuman treatments (e.g., electroconvulsive therapy without anesthesia).
*   **Advance Directive:** A person can state how they wish to be treated if they fall ill in the future.

### **7. Mnemonic for Mental Health Needs**

To remember the basic psychological needs that services aim to fulfill: **"SPARE"**
*   **S** - Sense of personal worth
*   **P** - Participation/Belonging
*   **A** - Affection/Love
*   **R** - Recognition/Approval
*   **E** - Emotional Independence/Self-actualization

### **8. Current Focus Areas (The "Forefront")**

1.  **Integration with General Health:** Managing mental health issues at the **PHC level** by the Medical Officer, not just by psychiatrists.
2.  **[[Life Skills Education]]:** School mental health programs to help adolescents cope with stress.
3.  **Suicide Prevention:** Establishing counselling centers and help lines.
4.  **Workplace Stress Management:** Addressing stress in formal and informal sectors.
