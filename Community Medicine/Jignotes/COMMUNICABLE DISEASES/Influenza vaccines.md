# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Influenza vaccines

### Influenza Vaccines

[[Influenza]] is an acute respiratory tract infection caused by the Influenza virus. Vaccination is the primary strategy for prevention during inter-pandemic periods and a key pillar of pandemic preparedness. Due to the unique ability of the virus to undergo [[Antigenic Drift]] (minor changes) and [[Antigenic Shift]] (major changes), vaccines must be updated annually.

### 1. Classification of Influenza Vaccines

Currently, there are three main technologies used: Egg-based, Cell-cultured, and Recombinant. Broadly, they are categorized into Inactivated (Killed) and Live Attenuated types.

| Feature | Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (IIV) | Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type** | Killed/Inactivated virus | Live attenuated virus (Cold-adapted) |
| **Formulation** | **Whole virus:** Intact virus (more reactogenic)<br>**Split virus:** Disrupted by detergent (less side effects)<br>**Subunit:** Contains only HA and NA antigens | Whole virus (attenuated) |
| **Route** | **Intramuscular** (Deltoid) | **Intranasal Spray** |
| **Dose** | 0.5 ml (Adults/Older children)<br>0.25 ml (Pediatric dose) | 0.5 ml (0.25 ml per nostril) |
| **Immunity** | Predominantly Humoral (IgG) | Local (IgA) + Systemic (Humoral & Cellular) |
| **Target Age** | > 6 months of age | 2 years to 49 years (Healthy individuals) |

### 2. Vaccine Composition

The vaccine composition is reviewed annually by the [[WHO]] Global Influenza Surveillance Network based on circulating strains.
*   **Trivalent Vaccines:** Contain 3 strains:
    1.  Influenza A (H1N1)
    2.  Influenza A (H3N2)
    3.  Influenza B virus
*   **Quadrivalent Vaccines:** Contain the above three + an additional Influenza B strain (to cover both Victoria and Yamagata lineages).

### 3. Schedule and Administration

*   **Frequency:** Annual vaccination is recommended because immunity wanes (lasts 6–12 months) and strains change (drift).
*   **Primary Series in Children:** Children aged **6 months to 8 years** receiving the vaccine for the *first time* require **2 doses** administered at least **4 weeks** apart to ensure adequate immune response.
*   **Timing:** Ideally before the onset of influenza season (October/November in Northern Hemisphere). Protection develops approx. **14 days** after vaccination.

### 4. Priority Groups for Vaccination

WHO recommends vaccination for high-risk groups to prevent severe disease and death. The order of priority is:

1.  **Pregnant Women:** Highest priority (can be given at any stage of pregnancy).
2.  **Children:** Aged 6 months to 5 years.
3.  **Elderly:** Aged > 65 years.
4.  **Chronic Medical Conditions:** Diabetes, Heart disease, Chronic lung disease (COPD/Asthma), Renal failure, Immunosuppression (HIV/AIDS).
5.  **Health Care Workers:** To protect patients and essential health infrastructure.

> **Mnemonic for Priority Groups: "PEACH"**
> *   **P** - **P**regnant women
> *   **E** - **E**lderly (>65 yrs)
> *   **A** - **A**dults with chronic co-morbidities
> *   **C** - **C**hildren (6mo - 5yrs)
> *   **H** - **H**ealth care workers

### 5. Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI)

*   **Common (IIV):** Local soreness, redness, swelling at injection site (lasts 1–2 days). Mild fever, myalgia.
*   **Common (LAIV):** Runny nose, nasal congestion, sore throat, cough (flu-like symptoms).
*   **Serious (Rare):**
    *   **[[Guillain-Barre Syndrome]] (GBS):** Very rare association with killed vaccines (approx. 1 excess case per million vaccinated).
    *   **Anaphylaxis:** Usually due to egg protein hypersensitivity.

### 6. Contraindications

| Vaccine Type | Contraindications |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Inactivated (IIV)** | • Severe allergy to **Chicken Eggs** (Ovalbumin)<br>• History of severe reaction/anaphylaxis to previous dose<br>• History of **Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS)** within 6 weeks of previous flu vaccine<br>• Infants **< 6 months** of age<br>• Moderate-to-severe acute febrile illness (Defer vaccination) |
| **Live Attenuated (LAIV)** | • **All contraindications of IIV** PLUS:<br>• **Immunocompromised** status (e.g., HIV, cancer)<br>• **Pregnancy**<br>• Children **< 2 years** and Adults **> 50 years**<br>• Children on long-term **Aspirin** therapy (Risk of [[Reye's Syndrome]])<br>• History of Asthma/Wheezing in children |

**Clinical Relevance:**
*   **Egg Allergy:** Most modern vaccines have very low egg protein. However, if a patient has a history of *severe* anaphylaxis to eggs, they should receive **Recombinant Influenza Vaccine** (which is egg-free) or be vaccinated in a medical setting equipped to manage anaphylaxis.
*   **Herd Immunity:** Vaccination of school-aged children significantly reduces transmission to households and the community.

### 7. Pandemic Influenza Vaccines (Swine Flu / Bird Flu)

*   **H1N1 (Swine Flu) Vaccine:**
    *   Strain: A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) v-like strain.
    *   Type: Usually inactivated, monovalent or part of trivalent seasonal vaccine.
    *   Dose: Single IM injection. Protection develops after 14 days.
*   **H5N1 (Bird Flu) Vaccine:**
    *   Approved for age 18–64 years.
    *   Inactivated, 2 doses given 28 days apart.
