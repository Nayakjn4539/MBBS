# [[DEMOGRAPHY AND FAMILY PLANNING]] > Declining sex ratio had many adverse consequences

# Declining Sex Ratio and its Adverse Consequences

### Definition
[[Sex Ratio]] is defined as the number of females per 1000 males in a population. It is a sensitive indicator of the status of women in society.
*   **Formula:** $\frac{\text{Number of Females}}{\text{Number of Males}} \times 1000$
*   **Child Sex Ratio (CSR):** Defined as the number of female children (0–6 years) per 1000 male children in the same age group. A decline in CSR is an "alarm signal" for the future.

### Current Scenario
*   **Ideal Sex Ratio:** Should be around 1000 or slightly higher (nature favors females biologically).
*   **India's Status:** The sex ratio is generally **adverse to women**.
    *   Census 2011: **943** females per 1000 males.
    *   Child Sex Ratio (2011): **914**, which is a significant decline from previous decades.
*   **Regional Variations:** Kerala has a favorable ratio (1084), while states like Haryana have historically low ratios.

### Adverse Consequences of Declining Sex Ratio
The "Female Deficit Syndrome" or adverse sex ratio leads to severe social and demographic instability. The major consequences include:

**1. Marriage Squeeze and Bride Shortage**
*   A scarcity of women leads to a shortage of brides for eligible bachelors.
*   This results in men delaying marriage or remaining unmarried involuntarily.
*   In some communities, this may lead to the practice of **buying brides** from other regions or lower socio-economic strata.

**2. Increase in Crime and Violence Against Women**
*   The imbalance triggers antisocial hazards. There is a potential rise in sex crimes, including [[rape]], abduction, and molestation.
*   Women become more vulnerable to **trafficking** and exploitation.

**3. Polyandry and Social Distortion**
*   To cope with the shortage of women, societies might regress to practices like **polyandry** (one woman having multiple husbands), disrupting the traditional [[family structure]].

**4. Commodification of Women**
*   Women may be treated as commodities rather than individuals with rights. This exacerbates **gender discrimination** and lowers the dignity of women in society.

**5. Demographic Imbalance**
*   Fewer women in the reproductive age group ($15-49$ years) eventually leads to a decline in the total number of births, but this is a pathological decline rather than a healthy demographic transition.
*   It creates a **societal dependency burden** where a large population of aging bachelors may lack family support in later life.

**6. Mental Health Issues**
*   Frustration, aggression, and loneliness among young men unable to find partners can lead to increased stress and social unrest.

### Causes (The "Why")
To understand the consequences, one must briefly acknowledge the causes, often termed the **"Missing Women"** phenomenon:
1.  **Son Preference:** Strong cultural preference for male children due to economic utility and religious rituals.
2.  **Female Feticide:** Misuse of [[prenatal diagnostic techniques]] (Ultrasound) for sex-selective abortion.
3.  **Female Infanticide:** Deliberate killing of girl babies.
4.  **Neglect of the Girl Child:** Leading to higher mortality rates in girls under 5 years due to poor nutrition and lack of medical care.
5.  **Dowry System:** Viewing daughters as an economic liability.

### Preventive Measures and Interventions

**1. Legal Measures**
*   **[[PC-PNDT Act]] (1994):** Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act bans sex selection and regulates diagnostic techniques to prevent female feticide.
*   **MTP Act:** Regulates abortion but strictly prohibits sex-selective termination.

**2. Social Welfare Schemes**
*   **Balika Samridhi Yojana:** Cash incentives for the birth of a girl child.
*   **Beti Bachao Beti Padhao:** (Save the daughter, educate the daughter) aims to prevent gender-biased sex selective elimination.
*   **Empowerment of Women:** Education and employment to raise the status of women is the best long-term contraceptive and equalizer.

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Doctor's Responsibility:** As a medical practitioner, it is illegal and unethical to reveal the sex of the fetus to the parents. Strict documentation (Form F) is required for all ultrasonography clinics under the PC-PNDT Act.
*   **Audit:** Keep track of sex ratio at birth in hospital records to identify skewness early.

### Mnemonic
**"SCARE"** the society with the consequences:
*   **S** - **S**hortage of Brides (Marriage Squeeze)
*   **C** - **C**rime against women increases (Trafficking/Rape)
*   **A** - **A**ntisocial behavior (Polyandry/Aggression)
*   **R** - **R**eproductive imbalance (Fewer mothers)
*   **E** - **E**conomic Commodification of women
