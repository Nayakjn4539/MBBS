# [[Medicine And Social Sciences]] > Cultural Factors in Health and Disease

### **Cultural Factors in Health and Disease**

[[Culture]] is defined as "learned behavior which has been socially acquired". It is the product of human societies and includes customs, beliefs, laws, religion, and moral precepts. These factors deeply influence health behaviors, perception of illness, and utilization of health services.

#### **1. Concept of Aetiology and Cure**
In many rural and traditional societies, the causes of disease are broadly classified into two groups:

*   **Supernatural Causes:**
    *   **Wrath of Gods/Goddesses:** Diseases like [[Chickenpox]] and [[Smallpox]] were often attributed to the anger of deities (e.g., *Sitala Mata*). Treatment often involves *pujas* rather than drugs,,.
    *   **Breach of Taboo:** Violation of social prohibitions (e.g., sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman) is believed to cause venereal diseases,,.
    *   **Past Sins:** Diseases like [[Leprosy]] and [[Tuberculosis]] are often viewed as punishment for sins committed in past lives,,.
    *   **Evil Eye:** Common belief that children are susceptible to the "evil eye," leading to the use of charms and amulets,,.
    *   **Spirit Intrusion:** Hysteria and epilepsy are sometimes attributed to possession by evil spirits or ghosts,.

*   **Physical Causes:**
    *   **Weather:** Exposure to heat is blamed for *loo* (heat stroke),,.
    *   **Impure Water:** Recognized as a cause of disease,.
    *   **Impure Blood:** Skin conditions like boils and scabies are often attributed to "impure blood",,.

#### **2. Environmental Sanitation**
Cultural habits significantly impact environmental hygiene and disease transmission:

*   **Disposal of Human Excreta:** Open defecation is a time-honored practice in many rural areas, often preferred over latrines due to the belief that latrines are dirty or meant for city dwellers. This promotes [[Soil Pollution]] and hookworm infestation,,.
*   **Disposal of Wastes:** Refuse is often thrown in front of houses or allowed to accumulate. Cow dung is stored for fuel (cakes), creating breeding grounds for flies,,.
*   **Water Supply:**
    *   Village wells and ponds serve as social gathering spots but are often polluted by bathing, washing clothes, and washing animals,,.
    *   Rivers are considered "holy," leading to the practice of drinking raw river water during pilgrimages, which spreads [[Cholera]] and gastroenteritis,.
    *   Step-wells were historically linked to [[Guineaworm]] disease.
*   **Housing:** Often ill-ventilated and dark due to fear of thieves or ghosts, leading to respiratory diseases like Tuberculosis. Animals (cattle) are often kept within the dwelling,,.

#### **3. Food Habits**
Food habits are deeply rooted in religion, custom, and beliefs:

*   **Vegetarianism:** High social value in Hindu society. Muslims generally avoid pork, and Hindus avoid beef,,.
*   **Hot and Cold Foods:** Foods are classified based on their perceived effect on the body rather than nutritional value.
    *   *Hot Foods:* Meat, fish, eggs, jaggery (often avoided in pregnancy),.
    *   *Cold Foods:* Curd, milk, vegetables,.
*   **Eating Order:** In many traditional homes, men eat first, and women eat last (often leftovers), leading to higher rates of [[Malnutrition]] and [[Anemia]] in women,,.
*   **Adulteration:** Milk is often watered down due to the belief that boiling pure milk will dry up the donor animal's secretion,.
*   **Addictions:** Social sanction for alcohol or cannabis in certain groups affects health.

| **Unimportant** | Piercing of ears and nose. | Generally harmless if hygienic,,. |
| **Uncertain** | Application of *Kajal* (black soot) to eyes to ward off evil eye. | Risk of [[Trachoma]] and eye infections,,. |

*   **Son Preference:** Strong desire for a male child contributes to large family size and neglect of the female child,.

#### **5. Personal Hygiene**
*   **Oral Hygiene:** Use of neem twigs, ash, or charcoal is common. While neem has medicinal properties, rough use can damage gums,,.
*   **Bathing:** Religious rituals often mandate bathing (e.g., after menstruation or childbirth), which promotes hygiene. However, use of common village ponds can spread infection,,.

    *   *Reverse Smoking:* Burning end inside the mouth (Andhra Pradesh) is linked to [[Oral Cancer]],.
*   **Purdah System:** Observance of purdah (seclusion) deprives women of sunlight, leading to [[Osteomalacia]] and Vitamin D deficiency, and increases TB risk due to confinement,,.
*   **Wearing Shoes:** Walking barefoot is common in rural areas, facilitating [[Hookworm]] transmission,.
*   **Circumcision:** A religious practice among Muslims/Jews; associated with lower rates of penile and cervical cancer,.
