# [[Environment And Health]] > Water Safe Water definition and Requirements

### [[Safe and Wholesome Water]]: Definition

Water intended for human consumption should be both safe and wholesome. It is defined by the following four criteria:

1.  **Pathogen Free:** It must be free from [[pathogenic agents]] (bacteria, viruses, protozoa, helminths).
2.  **Chemical Safety:** It must be free from harmful chemical substances (e.g., arsenic, lead, excess fluoride).
3.  **Aesthetic Quality:** It must be pleasant to the taste, i.e., free from color and odor.
4.  **Usability:** It must be usable for domestic purposes (e.g., cooking, washing).

*Water is termed "polluted" or "contaminated" if it does not fulfill these criteria.*

**Mnemonic for Definition:** **P-C-P-U**
*   **P** - **P**athogen free
*   **C** - **C**hemical free (harmful ones)
*   **P** - **P**leasant (Taste/Odor/Color)
*   **U** - **U**sable for domestic use

### Water Requirements

The consumption of water depends on climate, standard of living, and habits of the people.

**1. Basic Physiological Requirement**
*   Approximately **2 liters per head per day** is required just for survival.

**2. Daily Supply Targets (Per Capita Per Day)**
*   **Urban areas:** 150–200 liters (Standard).
    *   Note: In cities like Delhi, the target is higher (approx. 270 lpcd).
*   **Rural areas (India):** 40 liters (Target set for rural sanitation programs).

**3. Breakdown of Domestic Consumption (Approximate)**

| Purpose | Quantity (Liters/head/day) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Drinking | 1.5 - 3.0 |
| Cooking | 3.0 - 5.0 |
| Bathing | 30.0 - 35.0 |
| Washing (Clothes/Utensils) | 20.0 - 40.0 |
| Flushing Toilets | 30.0 |
| **Total** | **~135 - 150 Liters** |

### Criteria for Drinking Water Quality (WHO Guidelines)

To be considered safe, water must meet specific physical, microbiological, and chemical standards.

#### A. Physical Parameters (Acceptability)
*   **Turbidity:** Should be **< 1 NTU** (Nephelometric Turbidity Unit) for effective disinfection. Ideally free from turbidity.
*   **Colour:** Should be **< 15 TCU** (True Colour Units) or Hazen units.
*   **Taste and Odor:** Should be unobjectionable/agreeable.
*   **pH:** Acceptable range is **6.5 to 8.5**.
*   **[[Total Dissolved Solids]] (TDS):** Desirable < 500 mg/L; Permissible < 1000 mg/L. Water becomes unpalatable > 1200 mg/L.

#### B. Microbiological Standards (Most Important)
Ideally, drinking water should contain **zero** pathogenic microorganisms.
*   **[[E. coli]]:** Must not be detectable in any 100 ml sample (Primary indicator of recent fecal pollution).
*   **Total [[Coliforms]]:** Must not be detectable in any 100 ml sample (95% of samples in a year for large supplies).
*   **Fecal Streptococci:** Indicator of **recent** contamination.
*   **Clostridium perfringens:** Indicator of **remote/old** contamination.

#### C. Chemical Standards
Certain chemicals have specific limits due to health impacts:

| Chemical | Guideline Value (Upper Limit) | Health Impact of Excess |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Fluoride]]** | 0.5 – 0.8 mg/L (Optimum)<br>1.5 mg/L (Max limit) | **< 0.5:** Dental Caries<br>**> 1.5:** Dental Fluorosis (Mottling)<br>**> 3.0:** Skeletal Fluorosis |
| **Nitrates** | 50 mg/L | Infantile Methaemoglobinaemia ([[Blue Baby Syndrome]]) |
| **Nitrites** | 3 mg/L | Indicates recent pollution; toxic |
| **Arsenic** | 0.01 mg/L | Arsenicosis, Skin Cancer, Blackfoot disease |
| **Lead** | 0.01 mg/L | Neurological damage (Plumbism) |
| **Hardness** | 100 – 300 mg/L (as CaCO3) | Scale formation (High); Corrosive (Low) |

#### D. Radiological Standards (New Guidelines)
*   **Gross alpha activity:** < 0.5 Bq/litre.
*   **Gross beta activity:** < 1.0 Bq/litre.

### Criteria for Problem Habitations (India)
In the context of rural water supply in India, habitations are classified based on water availability and quality:
1.  **Not Covered (NC) / No Safe Source (NSS):**
    *   Source is **> 1.6 km** away in plains or **> 100 m** elevation in hills.
    *   Water has quality problems (Arsenic, Fluoride, Salinity).
    *   Quantum of water is insufficient for drinking/cooking.
2.  **Partially Covered (PC):** Source is within distance norms but capacity is only **10–40 lpcd**.
3.  **Fully Covered (FC):** Meets all norms.
