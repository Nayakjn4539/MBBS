# [[Esophagus]] > Achalasia Cardiac

# [[Achalasia Cardia]]

### Definition
[[Achalasia Cardia]], also known as **Cardiospasm**, is a primary [[esophageal motility disorder]] characterized by the failure of the [[lower esophageal sphincter]] (LES) to relax during swallowing and the absence of peristalsis in the body of the [[esophagus]],. This results in a functional obstruction at the gastroesophageal junction, leading to proximal dilatation of the esophagus,.

### Etiology
The exact etiology is often unknown, but several factors and theories have been identified:
*   **Neurological Defect:** The principal lesion is the degeneration of the [[Auerbach's plexus]] (myenteric plexus) in the esophageal wall,. There is a selective loss of postganglionic inhibitory neurons (containing **Nitric Oxide** and **Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide**) in the LES, while cholinergic neurons (responsible for contraction) are spared.
*   **Infectious:** Infection by *Trypanosoma cruzi* destroys the myenteric plexus, leading to a condition known as **Chagas' disease**, which clinically mimics achalasia,.
*   **Genetic/Autoimmune:** Possible hereditary, degenerative, or autoimmune factors.

### Pathology
1.  **Neuromuscular Incoordination:** Spasm of the cardiac end of the esophagus with failure of relaxation.
2.  **Esophageal Changes:** Consequently, the upper part of the esophagus undergoes muscular hypertrophy and dilatation.
3.  **Advanced Stage:** The esophagus becomes markedly dilated, elongated, and tortuous (sigmoid esophagus or [[megaesophagus]]),.

### Clinical Features
The condition is commonly seen in middle-aged adults, though it can occur in children.

| Symptom | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Dysphagia** | This is the most common symptom. It is often **paradoxical dysphagia**, meaning difficulty swallowing **liquids more than solids** or equal difficulty for both. This contrasts with mechanical obstruction (e.g., malignancy) where dysphagia is first for solids. |
| **Regurgitation** | Regurgitation of undigested food and saliva, particularly at night when recumbent. |
| **Pain** | Retrosternal pain or heartburn may be present. |
| **Respiratory** | Coughing, choking, or aspiration pneumonia due to spillover of retained food into the airway,. |
| **Weight Loss** | Malnutrition and weight loss due to long-standing obstruction. |

### Investigations

#### 1. Barium Swallow (Contrast Radiography)
This is a primary screening test.
*   **Findings:**
    *   **Bird's Beak/Pencil-tip/Rat-tail appearance:** Smooth tapering of the lower end of the esophagus,,.
    *   **Dilatation:** Fusiform dilatation of the proximal esophagus with an air-fluid level.
    *   **Motility:** Absence of peristalsis; tertiary contractions may be seen.
    *   **Hurst Phenomenon:** Barium passes into the stomach in spurts, resembling "snowflakes".
    *   **Sigmoid Esophagus:** In advanced cases, the esophagus appears elongated and tortuous.

#### 2. Esophageal Manometry
This is the **gold standard** for diagnosis.
*   **Findings:**
    *   High resting pressure of the [[lower esophageal sphincter]] (LES).
    *   **Failure of LES relaxation** upon swallowing,.
    *   **Aperistalsis** (absence of progressive contractions) in the body of the esophagus,.

#### 3. Esophagoscopy (Upper GI Endoscopy)
*   **Purpose:** Essential to rule out **pseudoachalasia** caused by carcinoma of the cardia or strictures,.
*   **Findings:** Dilated esophagus with retained food/fluid; the scope passes through the GE junction with gentle pressure (unlike malignancy where there is mechanical resistance).

#### 4. Chest X-ray
*   May show a widened mediastinum, absence of fundal gas shadow, and an air-fluid level behind the heart.

### Management
The goal is to relieve the functional obstruction at the LES.

#### Medical Management
Used for patients unfit for surgery or with mild symptoms.
*   **Calcium Channel Blockers:** e.g., Nifedipine.
*   **Nitrates:** e.g., Isosorbide dinitrate.
*   **Mechanism:** These drugs relax smooth muscles but have limited success.

#### Non-Surgical Interventions
1.  **Botulinum Toxin Injection:** Injected endoscopically into the LES. It blocks cholinergic nerve fibers, reducing sphincter tone. Effective but temporary; requires repetition every 2 years,.
2.  **Pneumatic Dilatation:** Forceful dilatation of the LES using a hydrostatic bag or balloon to tear muscle fibers. Perforation is a risk (5%),.

#### Surgical Management
*   **Heller's Cardiomyotomy:** This is the definitive treatment.
    *   **Procedure:** A longitudinal incision is made through the circular muscle fibers of the lower esophagus and proximal stomach, leaving the mucosa intact.
    *   **Approach:** Can be performed open, thoracoscopically, or laparoscopically.
    *   **Adjunct:** Often combined with a partial fundoplication (e.g., Dor or Toupet) to prevent postoperative [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD).

### Complications
*   Aspiration pneumonia.
*   Malnutrition.
*   Increased risk of developing **Squamous Cell [[Carcinoma Esophagus]]** due to chronic stasis and irritation.

***

**Clinical Implication:**
In an elderly patient presenting with symptoms of achalasia but with a short history and significant weight loss, always suspect **Pseudoachalasia** (malignancy of the gastroesophageal junction). Endoscopy with biopsy is mandatory to rule out cancer.

**Mnemonic for Clinical Features:** **3 Ds**
*   **D**ysphagia (Liquids > Solids)
*   **D**ilatation of esophagus
*   **D**ecreased weight (Malnutrition)
