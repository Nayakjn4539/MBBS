# [[Upper Limb]] > X-ray findings for upper Limb

### General Principles of Upper Limb Radiography

When evaluating the [[Upper Limb]], a systematic approach to reading X-rays is essential to identify fractures, dislocations, and pathologies. The standard rule is the "Rule of Twos": Two views (Anteroposterior and Lateral), Two joints (joint above and below the injury), and Two limbs (for comparison in children).

### The Shoulder Region

#### Standard Views
*   **Anteroposterior (AP) View:** Shows the [[Glenohumeral joint]], [[Clavicle]], and [[Scapula]].
*   **Axillary View:** Crucial for determining the relationship of the humeral head to the glenoid fossa.
*   **Scapular Y View (Lateral):** Used to assess dislocations.

#### Anatomical Landmarks and Structures
*   **Proximal Humerus:** Includes the [[Head of Humerus]], [[Anatomical Neck]], [[Greater Tuberosity]], [[Lesser Tuberosity]], and [[Surgical Neck]].
*   **Scapula:** [[Glenoid Fossa]], [[Acromion Process]], [[Coracoid Process]], [[Spine of Scapula]].
*   **Joints:** [[Acromioclavicular Joint]], [[Glenohumeral Joint]].

#### Specific Radiographic Signs and Markers
| Sign/Marker | X-ray Appearance | Clinical Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Light Bulb Sign]]** | The humeral head appears circular (like a light bulb) in AP view due to internal rotation. | Diagnostic of **[[Posterior Shoulder Dislocation]]**. |
| **[[Empty Glenoid Sign]]** | The glenoid cavity appears vacant without the humeral head articulating. | Diagnostic of **[[Anterior Shoulder Dislocation]]**. |
| **Loss of Elliptical Overlap** | Loss of the normal crescent overlap between the humeral head and glenoid. | Suggests **[[Shoulder Dislocation]]**. |
| **[[Codman's Triangle]]** | Triangular elevation of periosteum at the tumor-cortex junction. | Suggestive of malignancy, typically **[[Osteosarcoma]]**. |

**Clinical Implication:** In posterior dislocation, the AP view can be deceptive; the **Light Bulb Sign** is critical because the head is locked in internal rotation.

### The Elbow Region

#### Standard Views
*   **AP View:** Taken with the elbow fully extended.
*   **Lateral View:** Taken with the elbow flexed at 90 degrees.

#### Anatomical Structures
*   **Distal Humerus:** [[Medial Epicondyle]], [[Lateral Epicondyle]], [[Capitulum]] (lateral), [[Trochlea]] (medial), [[Olecrenon Fossa]].
*   **Proximal Radius/Ulna:** [[Radial Head]], [[Olecranon Process]], [[Coronoid Process]].

#### Specific Radiographic Signs and Markers
*   **[[Fat Pad Sign]] (Sail Sign):**
    *   **Appearance:** Elevation of the anterior and posterior fat pads due to joint effusion/hemarthrosis. The anterior fat pad becomes prominent (sail-shaped), and the posterior fat pad (normally invisible) becomes visible,.
    *   **Implication:** In children, highly suggestive of an undisplaced **[[Supracondylar Fracture]]**. In adults, suggests a **[[Radial Head Fracture]]**.
*   **[[Baumann's Angle]]**:
    *   **Measurement:** The angle between the long axis of the humeral shaft and the physeal line of the lateral condyle.
    *   **Implication:** Used to assess the reduction of supracondylar fractures and predict the final carrying angle (to avoid **[[Cubitus Varus]]**).
*   **Anterior Humeral Line:**
    *   **Observation:** A line drawn down the anterior cortex of the humerus should intersect the middle third of the capitulum.
    *   **Implication:** If it passes anterior to the capitulum, it indicates posterior displacement of the distal fragment (Extension type Supracondylar fracture).
*   **[[Radiocapitellar Line]]**:
    *   **Observation:** A line drawn through the center of the radial neck should pass through the center of the capitulum in all views.
    *   **Implication:** Disruption indicates **[[Radial Head Dislocation]]** (seen in **[[Monteggia Fracture]]**).

### The Forearm and Wrist

#### Standard Views
*   **AP and Lateral:** Standard for forearm bones.
*   **Scaphoid Views:** AP, Lateral, and Oblique (Ziter view) with the wrist in ulnar deviation.

#### Anatomical Structures
*   **Bones:** [[Radius]], [[Ulna]], [[Radial Styloid]], [[Ulnar Styloid]].
*   **Carpal Bones:** [[Scaphoid]], [[Lunate]], [[Triquetrum]], [[Pisiform]], [[Trapezium]], [[Trapezoid]], [[Capitate]], [[Hamate]].

**Mnemonic for Carpal Bones:**
**S**he **L**ooks **T**oo **P**retty, **T**ry **T**o **C**atch **H**er
(Scaphoid, Lunate, Triquetrum, Pisiform, Trapezium, Trapezoid, Capitate, Hamate)

#### Specific Radiographic Signs and Markers
| Sign/Marker | X-ray Appearance | Clinical Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Terry Thomas Sign]]** | Widened gap (>2-4mm) between the scaphoid and lunate. | Indicates **[[Scapholunate Dissociation]]** (rotatory subluxation of scaphoid). |
| **[[Spilled Teacup Sign]]** | On lateral view, the lunate is tilted and displaced volarly, looking like a spilled cup. | Diagnostic of **[[Lunate Dislocation]]**. |
| **[[Dinner Fork Deformity]]** | Dorsal tilt and displacement of the distal radial fragment. | Characteristic of **[[Colles' Fracture]]**. |
| **[[Garden Spade Deformity]]** | Volar displacement of the distal radial fragment. | Characteristic of **[[Smith's Fracture]]**. |
| **[[Pie in the Sky Sign]]** | Triangular appearance of lunate on AP view. | Suggests **[[Perilunate Dislocation]]**. |

**Clinical Implication:** In scaphoid fractures, initial X-rays may be negative. If clinical tenderness is present in the anatomical snuffbox, the wrist should be immobilized and X-rays repeated after 2 weeks.

### The Hand

#### Standard Views
*   **AP and Oblique:** Lateral views are less useful for individual phalanges due to overlap.

#### Specific Radiographic Signs and Markers
*   **[[Kaplan's Lesion]] Sign:**
    *   **Appearance:** Presence of a sesamoid bone within the widened joint space of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint.
    *   **Implication:** Diagnostic of complex, irreducible dorsal **[[MCP Dislocation]]** (usually index finger).
*   **[[Boxer's Fracture]] Angulation:**
    *   **Appearance:** Fracture of the 5th metacarpal neck with volar angulation of the head.
*   **Erosions and Subluxations:**
    *   **Appearance:** Periarticular erosions and ulnar deviation of MCP joints.
    *   **Implication:** Characteristic of **[[Rheumatoid Arthritis]]**.

### Tumor-Specific Radiological Signs in Upper Limb

Certain lytic or blastic lesions in the upper limb (humerus/radius) present with pathognomonic signs:

1.  **[[Fallen Fragment Sign]]** (Fallen Leaf Sign):
    *   **Appearance:** A cortical bone fragment settles at the bottom of a lytic lesion,.
    *   **Diagnosis:** **[[Simple Bone Cyst]]** (Unicameral Bone Cyst), commonly in proximal humerus.
2.  **[[Soap Bubble Appearance]]**:
    *   **Appearance:** Expansile lytic lesion with thin internal septations.
    *   **Diagnosis:** **[[Giant Cell Tumor]]** (Osteoclastoma), often in distal radius.
3.  **[[Sunburst Appearance]]**:
    *   **Appearance:** Spicules of bone radiating outward from the cortex.
    *   **Diagnosis:** **[[Osteosarcoma]]** (proximal humerus).
4.  **[[Onion Peel Appearance]]**:
    *   **Appearance:** Layered periosteal reaction.
    *   **Diagnosis:** **[[Ewing's Sarcoma]]** (diaphysis of humerus).
