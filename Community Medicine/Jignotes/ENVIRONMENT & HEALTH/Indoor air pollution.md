# [[ENVIRONMENT & HEALTH]] > Indoor air pollution

The indoor environment represents a critical [[microenvironment]] where people spend a significant portion of their time. Indoor air pollution contributes substantially to total population exposure, often more than the outdoor environment. Surprisingly, air in tightly sealed modern offices and houses can be up to **100 times more polluted** than outdoor air.

### **Sources of Indoor Air Pollution**

The sources vary depending on the socio-economic status and the setting (rural vs. urban/modern).

| **Category** | **Specific Source** | **Key Pollutants** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Combustion (Domestic)** | [[Solid fuels]] (wood, crop waste, charcoal, coal, dung) used in open fires or traditional stoves | **Respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM)**, Carbon monoxide (CO), Sulphur dioxide ($SO_2$), PAHs |
| **Tobacco** | Smoking (Active and Passive) | Carcinogens, Particulates, Nicotine, CO |
| **Appliances** | Gas cookers, gas heaters | Nitrogen dioxide ($NO_2$), Carbon monoxide |
| **Building Materials** | Insulation, fire-proofing, earth/soil under buildings | **Asbestos**, **Radon** (radioactive gas) |
| **Furnishings/Chemicals** | Particle board, carpet adhesives, paints, varnishes, cleaning solvents | **Formaldehyde**, [[Volatile Organic Compounds]] (VOCs like benzene) |
| **Biological** | Damp materials, air conditioning systems, pets | Molds, fungi, bacteria, dander, dust mites |,,

*   **R** - **R**adon (and daughters)
*   **O** - **O**zone (from electric arcing/UV light)
*   **N** - **N**itrogen Dioxide
*   **S** - **S**ulphur Dioxide
*   **C** - **C**arcinogens (Tobacco smoke)
*   **A** - **A**sbestos
*   **R** - **R**espirable particles
*   **F** - **F**ormaldehyde

### **Health Effects**

The health impact of indoor air pollution is profound, particularly affecting vulnerable groups like women (who cook) and young children.

#### **1. Acute Effects**
*   **Irritation:** Mucous membranes of eyes, nose, and throat (due to formaldehyde, $SO_2$).
*   **Respiratory:** Cough, wheezing, breathlessness.
*   **Systemic:** Headache, dizziness, fatigue, nausea (often associated with **Sick Building Syndrome**).
*   **Infections:** Exposure significantly doubles the risk of [[childhood pneumonia]] (Acute Lower Respiratory Infections).

#### **2. Chronic and Long-term Effects**
*   **Respiratory Disease:**
    *   **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ([[COPD]]):** Women exposed to high levels of indoor smoke are **2.3 times** more likely to suffer from COPD.
    *   **Lung Cancer:** Approx. 17% of annual lung cancer deaths in adults are attributable to household air pollution from solid fuels.
    *   **Asthma:** Exacerbation of existing asthma.
*   **Cardiovascular Disease:**
    *   [[Ischaemic Heart Disease]] (IHD) and Stroke: Exposure accounts for a significant percentage of premature deaths due to these conditions.
*   **Pregnancy Outcomes:**
    *   Low Birth Weight (LBW)
    *   Stillbirths
*   **Others:**
    *   **Cataract**
    *   Nasopharyngeal and laryngeal cancers
    *   Tuberculosis (linked to reduced resistance and lung inflammation)

**Clinical Relevance:**
When a non-smoking woman presents with signs of chronic bronchitis or emphysema, suspect **Indoor Air Pollution** (Biomass fuel exposure) as the primary etiology (often termed "Hut Lung"). Always take a history regarding cooking fuels and kitchen ventilation.

### **Specific Hazardous Agents**

1.  **[[Radon]]:** A radioactive gas released from the soil or construction materials (granite/rocks). It is the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking.
2.  **[[Asbestos]]:** Used in insulation and roofing. Inhalation of fibers causes **Asbestosis**, **Lung Cancer**, and **Mesothelioma**.
3.  **[[Formaldehyde]]:** Released from plywood, particle boards, and carpets. Causes severe irritation of eyes and respiratory tract.
4.  **Carbon Monoxide (CO):** Produced by incomplete combustion. Has 200-240 times higher affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen. Causes chemical asphyxia.,

### **Prevention and Control**

**1. Engineering Measures**
*   **Ventilation:** Improve air exchange (dilution) using windows, exhaust fans, and chimneys.
*   **Stove Improvement:** Use of **Smokeless Chulhas** (improved cookstoves) which direct smoke outdoors.
*   **Design:** Proper location of the kitchen (separate from living rooms) and use of non-polluting construction materials.

**2. Source Substitution**
*   Replace solid biomass fuels (wood, dung, coal) with cleaner fuels like **LPG**, electricity, or solar energy.
*   Use lead-free paints.

**3. Biological Measures (Indoor Plants)**
Certain indoor plants are effective in removing toxic synthetic chemicals:
*   **Spider plants / Golden Pothos:** Remove Formaldehyde.
*   **Gerbera / Chrysanthemums:** Remove Benzene.
*   **Peace Lilies:** Remove Trichloroethylene.
*   *Recommendation:* At least one plant for every 100 sq. ft. of indoor space.

**4. Public Education**
*   Awareness regarding the dangers of [[passive smoking]] inside the house.
*   Proper maintenance of ventilation systems to prevent "Sick Building Syndrome".
