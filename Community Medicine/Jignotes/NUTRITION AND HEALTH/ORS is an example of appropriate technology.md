# [[NUTRITION AND HEALTH]] > ORS is an example of appropriate technology

### ORS as Appropriate Technology

**[[Appropriate Technology]]** is defined as technology that is scientifically sound, adaptable to local needs, acceptable to those who apply it and those for whom it is used, and capable of being maintained by the people themselves with resources the community and country can afford. **[[Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS)]]** perfectly fits this description and is often cited as the "most important medical advance of the 20th century."

#### 1. Justification of ORS as Appropriate Technology

*   **Scientifically Sound:** It is based on the physiological principle that **[[glucose]]** given orally enhances the intestinal absorption of **[[sodium]]** and water (Coupled Transport Mechanism). This corrects the electrolyte and water deficit caused by diarrhea,.
*   **Adaptable to Local Needs:** It can be prepared easily in any setting, from sophisticated hospitals to remote rural homes. If standard packets are unavailable, **[[Home Available Fluids (HAF)]]** like rice water, dal water, or simple sugar-salt solutions can be used,.
*   **Acceptable:** It is accepted by communities worldwide. It allows mothers to actively participate in the care of their children at home, demystifying the treatment of dehydration.
*   **Affordable:** It is extremely low-cost compared to intravenous (IV) fluid therapy. It saves resources by reducing hospital admissions.

#### 2. WHO Reduced Osmolarity ORS (New Formula)

The current recommendation is the **[[Reduced Osmolarity ORS]]** (total osmolarity 245 mOsm/L). Studies showed that the older formula (311 mOsm/L) was slightly hypertonic, potentially risking hypernatremia.

**Benefits of Reduced Osmolarity ORS:**,
*   Reduces stool output by **20%**.
*   Reduces vomiting by **30%**.
*   Reduces the need for unscheduled **[[Intravenous Therapy]]** by 33%.

**Composition of Reduced Osmolarity ORS:**,

| Ingredient | Amount (grams/liter) | Molar Concentration (mmol/liter) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Sodium Chloride]]** (NaCl) | 2.6 | Sodium: 75 |
| **[[Glucose]]** (Anhydrous) | 13.5 | Glucose: 75 |
| **[[Potassium Chloride]]** (KCl) | 1.5 | Potassium: 20 |
| **[[Trisodium Citrate]]** | 2.9 | Chloride: 65 |
| | | Citrate: 10 |
| **Total Weight** | **20.5 g** | **Total Osmolarity: 245** |

*Note: Trisodium citrate makes the product more stable (longer shelf life) than the previously used Sodium Bicarbonate.*

#### 3. Preparation and Administration

1.  **Dissolve:** Contents of one packet are dissolved in **one liter** of clean drinking water.
2.  **Usage:** The solution must be made fresh daily and used within **24 hours**. It should not be boiled after preparation.
3.  **Dose:**
    *   *No Dehydration (Plan A):* Give as much as the child wants.
    *   *Some Dehydration (Plan B):* 75 ml/kg over 4 hours.

#### 4. Adjunct Therapy: Zinc Supplementation

Current guidelines emphasize the use of **[[Zinc]]** along with ORS for 14 days,.
*   **Dose:**
    *   Infants < 6 months: **10 mg/day**.
    *   Children > 6 months: **20 mg/day**.
*   **Benefits:** Reduces the duration and severity of the current episode and prevents subsequent episodes for up to 3 months.

### Clinical Relevance
*   **[[Dehydration]]** is the main cause of death in diarrhea. ORS addresses this directly.
*   **"Super ORS":** Research is ongoing into ORS containing complex carbohydrates (rice powder, amino acids) to further reduce stool volume.
*   **Contraindications:** ORS may not be suitable in cases of severe dehydration with shock (requires IV Ringer's Lactate), paralytic ileus, or intractable vomiting.

### Mnemonic for Principles of Primary Health Care (including Appropriate Technology)
**"4 A's"** of Appropriate Technology/Primary Health Care:
1.  **A**cceptable (Cultural/Social)
2.  **A**ccessible (Geographical)
3.  **A**ffordable (Financial)
4.  **A**vailable (Physical)
