# Perthes Disease (Legg-Calvé-Perthes Disease)

### Definition and Nomenclature
[[Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease]] (LCPD) is a self-limiting, idiopathic condition characterized by **[[avascular necrosis]]** of the [[femoral head]] epiphysis in children, leading to bone death, resorption, and eventual re-ossification.

**Synonyms:**
*   [[Coxa plana]] (Flattened head)
*   Pseudocoxalgia
*   Osteochondritis deformans juvenilis

### Epidemiology
*   **Age:** Common in 4–8 years (Range 2–18 years).
*   **Gender:** Males > Females (Ratio 4:1 or 5:1).
*   **Laterality:** Usually unilateral (85-90%). If bilateral, the onset is non-simultaneous (asynchronous).
*   **Risk Factors:** Positive family history, low birth weight, delayed skeletal maturity, exposure to second-hand smoke.

### Pathogenesis and Natural History
The disease is a local, self-healing disorder that typically spans **2 to 4 years**. It progresses through specific pathological and radiological stages.

#### Pathological Stages
1.  **Stage of Ischaemia/Bone Death:** Disruption of blood supply leads to infarction. The bony [[epiphysis]] dies but looks normal on plain X-ray initially. Growth stops.
2.  **Stage of Revascularization and Repair:** New blood vessels invade the necrotic bone. Dead trabeculae are resorbed (fragmentation) and replaced by fibrous tissue and new woven bone (creeping substitution).
3.  **Stage of Distortion/Remodeling:** The bone heals, but the shape may be altered (coxa plana/magna) depending on the biological plasticity and mechanical forces.

### Radiological Staging (Elizabethtown Staging)
This system divides the disease evolution into four distinct stages visible on X-ray.

| Stage | Name | Radiological Features | Clinical Correlation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I** | **Initial / Avascular Necrosis** | • **[[Waldenstrom's sign]]**: Widening of the medial joint space (earliest sign).<br>• Increased density (sclerosis) of the epiphysis.<br>• Subchondral fracture line (**[[Crescent sign]]**) may be visible. | Synovitis, limping, pain. |
| **II** | **Fragmentation** | • Epiphysis appears fragmented and shrunken.<br>• Areas of radiolucency (resorption) mixed with sclerosis.<br>• "Head within a head" appearance. | Most active phase; highest risk of deformity. |
| **III** | **Reossification / Regeneration** | • New bone formation begins.<br>• Density normalizes.<br>• Head shape starts to redefine. | Healing phase. |
| **IV** | **Healed / Residual** | • Complete re-ossification.<br>• No avascular or fragmented areas.<br>• Residual deformity may be present (Coxa magna, Coxa plana, mushroom-shaped head). | Asymptomatic or residual stiffness. |

### Classification Systems
These are used to determine the extent of involvement and prognosis.

#### 1. Catterall Classification
Based on the amount of femoral head involvement.

*   **Group I:** Involvement of only the **anterior part** of the epiphysis.
*   **Group II:** Involvement of the **anterior part** plus a central sequestrum; lateral medial margins intact.
*   **Group III:** Involvement of almost the **entire head**, except a small medial part. "Head-within-a-head" sign.
*   **Group IV:** **Whole head** involvement; severe collapse.

#### 2. Herring’s Lateral Pillar Classification
Based on the height of the lateral pillar of the epiphysis during the fragmentation phase. It is currently the most prognostically useful classification.

*   **Group A:** No loss of height in the lateral third.
*   **Group B:** Loss of < 50% of the lateral pillar height.
*   **Group C:** Loss of > 50% of the lateral pillar height (Poor prognosis).

#### 3. Salter-Thompson Classification
Based on the extent of the **[[subchondral fracture]]** (crescent sign).
*   **Group A:** Fracture involves < 50% of the head (Good prognosis).
*   **Group B:** Fracture involves > 50% of the head (Poor prognosis).

### Clinical Features (Symptoms and Signs)

#### Symptoms
*   **Limp:** Often the first and only symptom. Typically a **painless limp** initially.
*   **Pain:** 
    *   Insidious onset.
    *   Usually mild or dull ache.
    *   **Site:** Groin, anterior thigh, or greater trochanter.
    *   **[[Referred pain]]:** Often referred to the **knee**. A child presenting with knee pain must have their hip examined.
    *   Aggravated by activity, relieved by rest.

#### Physical Signs
*   **Gait:** **[[Antalgic gait]]** (painful) or **Trendelenburg gait** (due to abductor weakness in late stages).
*   **Muscle Wasting:** Atrophy of the thigh (quadriceps) and gluteal muscles.
*   **Tenderness:** Anterior hip joint tenderness (Scarpa's triangle).
*   **Range of Motion (ROM):**
    *   **Limitation of [[Abduction]] and [[Internal Rotation]]** is characteristic.
    *   In the stage of synovitis, the hip is held in flexion, abduction, and lateral rotation (position of ease).
    *   In later stages, fixed flexion deformity or adduction contracture may develop.
*   **Limb Length Discrepancy:** Supratrochanteric shortening (limb shortening) due to collapse of the femoral head.

### "Head at Risk" Signs
Described by **Catterall**, these are radiological signs present during the active phase that indicate a poor prognosis and the potential need for surgical intervention.

**Mnemonic: G-H-L-M-C**
1.  **G**age sign: A V-shaped radiolucency on the lateral aspect of the epiphysis.
2.  **H**orizontal growth plate: The physis becomes horizontal rather than curved.
3.  **L**ateral subluxation: The femoral head migrates laterally out of the acetabulum (increase in medial joint space).
4.  **M**etaphyseal cysts: Lytic lesions in the metaphysis (diffuse metaphyseal reaction).
5.  **C**alcification lateral to the epiphysis: Calcification in the cartilaginous epiphysis.

### Clinical Implications and Prognosis
*   **Prognostic Factors:**
    *   **Age of onset:** Younger children (<6 years) have a better prognosis due to higher remodeling potential. Older children (>9 years) have a worse prognosis.
    *   **Gender:** Girls have a worse prognosis (less time for remodeling before skeletal maturity).
    *   **Head Involvement:** Catterall III/IV or Herring C have poorer outcomes.
    *   **Containment:** Loss of containment (subluxation) leads to deformity (Coxa Magna/Plana) and early **[[secondary osteoarthritis]]**.
