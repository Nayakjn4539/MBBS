# [[Corrosive Poisons]] > Sulphuric Acid

### Sulphuric Acid (H₂SO₄)

**Synonyms:** Oil of Vitriol, Battery Acid, Spirit of Vitriol.

#### Physical Properties
*   It is a heavy, colourless, odourless, and oily liquid.
*   **Hygroscopic:** It has an intense affinity for water. It extracts water from tissues violently, generating intense heat (exothermic reaction).
*   Non-fuming.

#### Mechanism of Action
1.  **Dehydration:** Extracts water from cells causing cell death.
2.  **Heat Production:** The exothermic reaction causes thermal burns superimposed on chemical burns.
3.  **Chemical Reaction:** Forms acid albumins (coagulation of proteins) and converts haemoglobin into acid [[haematin]].
4.  **Necrosis:** Produces **[[coagulation necrosis]]** of the tissues.

#### Clinical Features (Signs and Symptoms)
**1. Local Effects (Mouth and Throat)**
*   **Lips:** Swollen, excoriated with **brown or black streaks** (charring) running from the angles of the mouth to the chin (dribbling marks).
*   **Teeth:** Become **chalky white** or lose their enamel.
*   **Tongue:** Swollen, sodden, and black.
*   **Pain:** Immediate, intense burning pain in the mouth, throat, retrosternal region, and abdomen.
*   **Dysphagia:** Difficulty in swallowing due to oedema and pain.
*   **Voice:** Hoarse and husky; aphonia may occur due to laryngeal oedema.

**2. Gastrointestinal Tract**
*   **Vomiting:** Nausea and eructations followed by vomiting.
*   **Vomitus:** Contains altered blood (coffee ground appearance), mucus, and shreds of charred mucous membrane of the stomach. It is strongly acidic.
*   **Thirst:** Intense thirst is a prominent feature.
*   **Abdomen:** Distended and tender.
*   **Perforation:** Can occur in the stomach, leading to [[chemical peritonitis]].

**3. Respiratory System**
*   Inhalation of fumes or laryngeal involvement causes cough, dyspnoea, stridor, and laryngeal oedema, which may lead to asphyxia.

**4. Systemic Effects**
*   **Shock:** Pulse is rapid and feeble; skin is cold and clammy; hypotension.
*   **Renal:** Oliguria or anuria due to shock or renal failure.

#### Fatal Dose and Period
*   **Fatal Dose:** 5 to 10 ml (approx. 1 teaspoonful).
*   **Fatal Period:** 12 to 24 hours. Death can occur immediately from shock or laryngeal spasm.

#### Treatment
1.  **Immediate Dilution:** This is the priority. Dilute the acid by giving large quantities of water or milk.
2.  **[[Gastric lavage]]**: **Contraindicated** in severe cases due to the risk of perforating the corroded stomach wall. If done (very early cases), a soft rubber tube (Levine tube) should be used cautiously.
3.  **Neutralization:** Avoid carbonates/bicarbonates as they liberate CO₂ gas, distending the stomach and increasing rupture risk. Use **magnesium oxide**, calcined magnesia, or lime water.
4.  **Demulcents:** Egg whites, milk, olive oil, or butter to coat the mucosa.
5.  **General Measures:**
    *   IV fluids to combat shock and dehydration.
    *   Morphine for pain relief.
    *   Corticosteroids (Prednisolone) to prevent [[oesophageal strictures]].
    *   Tracheostomy if laryngeal oedema causes obstruction.
    *   **External Burns:** Wash immediately with copious amounts of water and soap; apply magnesium oxide paste.

### Autopsy Findings
**External:**
*   **Corrosion:** Brown or black stains (charring) on the lips, angles of the mouth, chin, and neck.
*   **Skin:** Necrotic areas are at first grayish-white but turn brown/black and leathery.
*   **Clothing:** May show holes and acid stains (stains turn red on litmus paper test).

**Internal:**
*   **Mouth/Oesophagus:** Mucosa is corroded, swollen, and desquamated. The epithelium of the oesophagus is relatively resistant (squamous), but the stomach (columnar) is severely affected.
*   **Stomach:**
    *   The wall is soft, spongy, and friable.
    *   **Consistency:** Resembles **"Wet Blotting Paper"**.
    *   **Colour:** Mucosa is blackened/charred due to acid haematin.
    *   **Perforation:** Common; usually on the greater curvature. If perforated, the acid spills into the peritoneal cavity causing black discolouration of adjacent organs (liver, spleen).
    *   **[[Magenstrasse]]**: The lesser curvature may show specific damage due to the pathway of the liquid.

### Vitriolage (Acid Throwing)
**Definition:** The act of throwing corrosive substances (usually sulphuric acid) on the face or body of a person with the intention of disfiguring or destroying vision.

**Medicolegal Aspects:**
*   **Motive:** Usually jealousy or revenge (e.g., rejected love proposals, dowry disputes).
*   **Agent:** Sulphuric acid is most common ("Oil of Vitriol"), followed by nitric acid or carbolic acid. Juice of *Semecarpus anacardium* (Marking nut) may also be used.
*   **Injuries:**
    *   Causes **Grievous Hurt**.
    *   Produces chemical burns, permanent scarring, disfigurement, and blindness (if eyes are involved).
    *   **Contractures:** Healing leads to severe scar tissue formation and deformities (e.g., ectropion of eyelids, microstomia).

**Legal Provisions (India):**
*   **IPC Section 326A (BNS 124(1)):** Voluntarily causing grievous hurt by use of acid. Punishment: Imprisonment not less than 10 years, extendable to life, plus fine (paid to victim).
*   **IPC Section 326B (BNS 124(2)):** Voluntarily throwing or attempting to throw acid. Punishment: Imprisonment 5 to 7 years plus fine.
*   **IPC Section 357C:** All hospitals (public/private) must provide immediate free first aid/treatment to victims and inform the police.

> **Mnemonic for Sulphuric Acid Findings: BLACK**
> *   **B**lack streaks on lips/chin.
> *   **L**eathery stomach wall.
> *   **A**cid haematin (vomit/stomach content).
> *   **C**harring (Carbonisation).
> *   **K**ills by shock/perforation.

### Medicolegal Importance
1.  **Suicide:** Common method in adults due to easy availability (bathroom cleaners, batteries).
2.  **Accidental:** May be mistaken for glycerine, castor oil, or syrup (if bottle is unlabelled).
3.  **Homicide:** Rare due to taste and immediate pain, except in infants or unconscious persons.
4.  **Vitriolage:** Specific medicolegal crime as described above.
5.  **Abortifacient:** Rarely used (dangerous).
