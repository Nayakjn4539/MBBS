# [[Clinical Examination]] > Examination of Wrist and Hand

### General Principles of Examination

Examination of the wrist and hand requires patience and meticulous attention to detail. The hand is a functional unit, and evaluation must assess both anatomy and function. The standard orthopedic routine of **Look, Feel, Move** is applied.

Both upper limbs should be bared for comparison.

#### 1. Inspection (Look)
**Attitude and Deformity:**
*   **Position of Function:** The wrist is dorsiflexed 20–30°, fingers slightly flexed.
*   **Position of Rest:** Natural posture of the hand when relaxed.
*   **Specific Deformities:**
    *   **Dinner Fork Deformity:** Seen in [[Colles' fracture]] (dorsal displacement of distal fragment).
    *   **Garden Spade Deformity:** Seen in [[Smith's fracture]] (volar displacement).
    *   **Madelung’s Deformity:** Prominence of the distal ulna due to growth arrest of the distal radius.
    *   **Claw Hand:** Hyperextension at [[metacarpophalangeal joints]] (MCP) and flexion at [[interphalangeal joints]] (IP), typical of [[ulnar nerve palsy]],.
    *   **Ape Thumb Deformity:** Thumb lies in the same plane as the palm (loss of opposition), seen in [[median nerve palsy]].
    *   **Wrist Drop:** Inability to extend the wrist, seen in [[radial nerve palsy]].
    *   **Mallet Finger:** Flexion deformity of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint due to extensor tendon avulsion.
    *   **Boutonnière Deformity:** Flexion of PIP joint and hyperextension of DIP joint.
    *   **Swan-neck Deformity:** Hyperextension of PIP joint and flexion of DIP joint (often in [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]]).

**Skin and Soft Tissues:**
*   **Wasting:** Check for guttering of interosseous spaces (ulnar nerve) or flattening of the **thenar eminence** (median nerve).
*   **Swelling:** Localized (e.g., [[ganglion cyst]]) or diffuse (e.g., cellulitis, rheumatoid synovitis).
*   **Dupuytren’s Contracture:** Thickening/puckering of palmar fascia, usually affecting the ring finger.

#### 2. Palpation (Feel)
*   **Temperature:** Assess local warmth (inflammation/infection).
*   **Tenderness:** Localize strictly to specific structures.
    *   **Anatomical Snuffbox:** Tenderness here suggests [[scaphoid fracture]]. The snuffbox is bounded by the *extensor pollicis longus* and *extensor pollicis brevis*,.
    *   **Radial Styloid:** Tenderness at the tip suggests [[De Quervain's tenosynovitis]].
    *   **Lister’s Tubercle:** Bony prominence on the dorsal radius.
*   **Swelling:** Confirm consistency (cystic for ganglion, bony for osteophytes).

#### 3. Movement (Move)
Ranges should be measured using a [[goniometer]]. Compare with the normal side.
*   **Wrist:**
    *   Dorsiflexion (Extension): Normal ~70–80°.
    *   Palmar flexion: Normal ~80–90°.
    *   Radial deviation: ~15–20°.
    *   Ulnar deviation: ~30–40°.
*   **Fingers:** Assess flexion and extension at MCP, PIP, and DIP joints.
*   **Thumb:** Extension, flexion, abduction, adduction, and **opposition** (touching the tip of the thumb to the tip of the little finger).

### Neurological Examination of the Hand

Peripheral nerve injuries are common in upper limb trauma. Specific tests isolate the motor function of muscles supplied by the [[Median Nerve]], [[Ulnar Nerve]], and [[Radial Nerve]].

#### 1. Median Nerve Tests
The median nerve supplies the flexor-pronator group in the forearm and the thenar muscles in the hand.

| Test Name | Methodology | Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pen Test** | Patient lays hand flat, palm up. Ask to touch a pen held above the thumb by abducting it vertically. | Tests **Abductor Pollicis Brevis**. Failure indicates median nerve palsy (Low lesion). |
| **Pointing Index / Oschner’s Clasp Test** | Patient asked to clasp hands together. | Index finger fails to flex (stands out) due to paralysis of **FDS** and **FDP** (lateral half). Indicates **High Median Nerve** lesion,. |
| **Benediction Test** | Patient asked to lift hand (as if blessing). | Inability to flex index and middle fingers (active sign). High lesion. |
| **Kiloh-Nevin Sign** | Patient attempts to make an "OK" sign (pinch tip of thumb to tip of index). | If **Anterior Interosseous Nerve** is injured, distal phalanges extend (pulp-to-pulp pinch instead of tip-to-tip) due to FPL/FDP paralysis. |

#### 2. Ulnar Nerve Tests
The ulnar nerve supplies the intrinsic muscles of the hand (interossei, medial lumbricals, adductor pollicis).

| Test Name | Methodology | Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Froment’s Sign (Book Test)** | Patient holds a book/card between thumb and index finger. Examiner pulls it away. | Positive if patient flexes the thumb IP joint (using FPL - Median N.) to compensate for paralyzed **Adductor Pollicis**,. |
| **Card Test** | Patient holds a card between extended fingers (e.g., middle and ring). Examiner pulls. | Tests **Palmar Interossei** (Adduction). Weakness indicates ulnar palsy,. |
| **Egawa’s Test** | Hand flat on table. Patient asked to move middle finger sideways. | Tests **Dorsal Interossei** (Abduction) of the middle finger. |
| **Wringing Test** | Patient asked to wring a towel. | Demonstrates weakness of grip strength. |

**Clinical Implication:** **Ulnar Paradox** - In high ulnar nerve lesions (at elbow), clawing is *less* severe than in low lesions (at wrist) because the FDP (which flexes the DIP joint) is also paralyzed in high lesions, reducing the flexion deformity.

#### 3. Radial Nerve Tests
The radial nerve supplies the extensors.

*   **Wrist Drop:** Inability to extend the wrist.
*   **Hitchhiker’s Sign:** Inability to extend the thumb (EPL/EPB paralysis).
*   **Sensory Check:** Loss of sensation over the **first dorsal web space**.

**Mnemonic for Nerve Injuries:**
*   **DR CUMA**
    *   **D**rop = **R**adial nerve
    *   **C**law = **U**lnar nerve
    *   **M**edian nerve = **A**pe hand

### Tendon Integrity Tests

It is crucial to differentiate between the **Flexor Digitorum Superficialis (FDS)** and **Flexor Digitorum Profundus (FDP)**.

#### 1. Flexor Digitorum Profundus (FDP) Test
*   **Technique:** Hold the patient's finger straight, stabilizing the PIP joint. Ask the patient to flex the distal phalanx.
*   **Mechanism:** FDP is the only tendon inserting into the distal phalanx.
*   **Result:** Inability to flex DIP joint indicates FDP rupture,.

#### 2. Flexor Digitorum Superficialis (FDS) Test
*   **Technique:** Hold all fingers *except the one being tested* in full extension (this neutralizes the FDP action due to its common muscle belly). Ask the patient to flex the isolated finger.
*   **Mechanism:** If the finger flexes at the PIP joint, the FDS is intact.
*   **Result:** Inability to flex PIP implies FDS injury,.

### Special Tests for Specific Conditions

#### 1. De Quervain's Tenosynovitis
Inflammation of the first dorsal compartment (APL and EPB tendons).
*   **Finkelstein’s Test:** The patient makes a fist with the thumb tucked inside the fingers. The examiner passively deviates the wrist to the ulnar side.
*   **Positive Result:** Sharp pain over the **radial styloid process**,.

#### 2. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS)
Compression of the median nerve at the wrist.
*   **Phalen’s Test:** Patient holds wrists in complete flexion (dorsal surfaces touching) for 60 seconds. Positive if tingling/numbness occurs in median nerve distribution,.
*   **Reverse Phalen’s (Prayer) Test:** Wrists extended (palms touching).
*   **Tinel’s Sign:** Gentle tapping (percussion) over the median nerve at the wrist. Positive if it produces tingling/electric shock sensation distally.
*   **Durkan’s Compression Test:** Direct compression over the carpal tunnel for 30 seconds. Considered the most sensitive clinical test.

#### 3. Scaphoid Fracture
*   **Anatomical Snuffbox Tenderness:** Deep pressure in the snuffbox.
*   **Scaphoid Tubercle Tenderness:** Palpation on the volar aspect.
*   **Axial Compression Test:** Longitudinal compression of the thumb metacarpal elicits pain at the scaphoid.

#### 4. Vascular Status
*   **Allen’s Test:**
    1.  Patient clenches fist to exsanguinate the hand.
    2.  Examiner occludes both radial and ulnar arteries.
    3.  Patient opens hand (palm is pale).
    4.  Examiner releases one artery.
    5.  **Result:** Observe refill time (hyperemia). Confirms patency of the palmar arches.
