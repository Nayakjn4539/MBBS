# [[DEMOGRAPHY AND FAMILY PLANNING]] > Write down the National Socio Demographic Goals for 2015. Outline the steps for evaluation of Family Planning Programme.

### National Socio-Demographic Goals (NPP 2000)

The [[National Population Policy 2000]] (NPP 2000) formulated comprehensive goals to be achieved by the year 2010 (often referenced in exam contexts for 2015 as benchmarks for evaluation). The primary aim was to achieve a stable population by 2045.

**The 14 National Socio-Demographic Goals are:**

1.  **Unmet Needs:** Address the [[unmet needs]] for basic reproductive and child health services, supplies, and infrastructure.
2.  **Education:** Make school education up to age 14 free and compulsory, and reduce dropouts at primary and secondary levels to below 20% for both boys and girls.
3.  **Infant Mortality:** Reduce the [[Infant Mortality Rate]] (IMR) to below **30 per 1000 live births**.
4.  **Maternal Mortality:** Reduce the [[Maternal Mortality Ratio]] (MMR) to below **100 per 100,000 live births**.
5.  **Immunization:** Achieve universal immunization of children against all [[vaccine-preventable diseases]].
6.  **Age of Marriage:** Promote delayed marriage for girls, not earlier than age 18 and preferably after **20 years** of age.
7.  **Delivery Care:** Achieve **80% institutional deliveries** and **100% deliveries by trained persons**.
8.  **Contraceptive Access:** Achieve universal access to information/counseling, and services for fertility regulation and contraception with a wide basket of choices.
9.  **Registration:** Achieve **100% registration** of births, deaths, marriages, and pregnancies.
10. **HIV/AIDS:** Contain the spread of [[Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome]] (AIDS), and promote greater integration between the management of reproductive tract infections (RTI) and sexually transmitted infections (STI) and the [[National AIDS Control Organisation]] (NACO).
11. **Communicable Diseases:** Prevent and control communicable diseases.
12. **Indian Systems of Medicine:** Integrate [[Indian Systems of Medicine]] (ISM) in the provision of reproductive and child health services, and in reaching out to households.
13. **Small Family Norm:** Promote vigorously the small family norm to achieve replacement levels of Total Fertility Rate (i.e., **TFR = 2.1**).
14. **Convergence:** Bring about convergence in the implementation of related social sector programs so that family welfare becomes a people-centered program.

### Evaluation of Family Planning Programme

Evaluation is the process of making judgments about selected objectives by comparing them with specified value standards to decide on alternative courses of action. A WHO Expert Committee (1975) defined five types/steps of evaluation:

#### 1. Evaluation of Need
This assesses the health, demographic, and socio-economic necessity for the program in a specific area.
*   **Context:** Analyzing the current status of [[maternal mortality]], infant mortality, and population density to justify the need for family planning interventions.

#### 2. Evaluation of Plans
*   **Focus:** Assessing the feasibility and adequacy of program plans.
*   **Activity:** Checking if the proposed infrastructure, budget, and manpower are sufficient to meet the set objectives.

#### 3. Evaluation of Performance
This measures the operational output of the program.
*   **Services:** Evaluation of clinic services, mobile units, post-partum services, and contraceptive distribution.
*   **Response:** Tracking the number of new acceptors and the characteristics of acceptors (age, parity).
*   **Cost Analysis:** Assessing the cost-effectiveness of the services delivered.
*   **Administrative Activities:** Monitoring manpower, data flow, and logistics.

#### 4. Evaluation of Effects
*   **Focus:** Changes in the mental and social state of the beneficiaries.
*   **Metrics:** Measuring changes in **Knowledge, Attitudes, Motivation, and Behavior** (KAP studies) regarding contraception and family size.

#### 5. Evaluation of Impact
This measures the final outcome and effectiveness of the program on the population. A WHO Study Group (1976) proposed the following indices:
*   **Family Size:** Average number of living children.
*   **Birth Interval:** Spacing between children.
*   **Birth Order:** Reduction in higher-order births.
*   **Age of Mother:** Age at first child and last child.
*   **Abortions:** Number of induced abortions.
*   **Demographic Indicators:** Changes in [[Birth Rate]], Growth Rate, and [[Net Reproduction Rate]] (NRR).
*   **Contraceptive Efficacy:** Measured by [[Pearl Index]] and Life Table Analysis.

***

**Clinical Relevance:**
Evaluation allows the **District Health Officer** or **Medical Officer** to identify bottlenecks (e.g., high dropout rates in oral pill users or low uptake of sterilization) and reallocate resources to improve the **Couple Protection Rate (CPR)**, which is crucial for achieving population stabilization.
