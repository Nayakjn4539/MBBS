# [[Nutrition And Health]] > Vitamins (Water Soluble - B Complex, C)

### **Overview of Water-Soluble Vitamins**

Water-soluble vitamins include the **Vitamin B Complex** group and **Vitamin C**. Unlike fat-soluble vitamins, these are generally not stored in the body (except Vitamin B12) and excess intake is excreted in the urine. Therefore, they require a daily dietary intake to prevent deficiency.

### **Vitamin B Complex**

These function primarily as **co-enzymes** in various metabolic processes.

#### **1. Thiamine (Vitamin B1)**
*   **Function:** Essential for carbohydrate metabolism. It acts as a co-enzyme ([[Thiamine Pyrophosphate]] - TPP) for the decarboxylation of pyruvate.
*   **Sources:** Whole grain cereals, wheat germ, yeast, pulses, oilseeds, and nuts (groundnut). The outer layer of rice (pericarp) is rich in thiamine.
    *   *Clinical Note:* Polishing or milling of rice removes thiamine. **Parboiling** of rice conserves it.
*   **Deficiency Disease:** [[Beriberi]] and [[Wernicke's Encephalopathy]].

**Clinical Forms of Thiamine Deficiency:**
| Type | Clinical Features |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Dry Beriberi** | **Nerve involvement.** Peripheral neuritis, muscle wasting, loss of reflexes, difficulty walking. |
| **Wet Beriberi** | **Cardiac involvement.** Edema, palpitations, breathlessness, heart failure. |
| **Infantile Beriberi** | Seen in infants (2-4 months) breastfed by thiamine-deficient mothers. Acute onset cardiac failure, aphonia (noiseless cry). |
| **Wernicke's Encephalopathy** | Often seen in alcoholics. Triad: Ophthalmoplegia, Ataxia, and Confusion. |

#### **2. Riboflavin (Vitamin B2)**
*   **Function:** Cellular oxidation and maintaining the integrity of mucocutaneous structures.
*   **Sources:** Liver, milk, eggs, green leafy vegetables. Germination of pulses increases B2 content.
*   **Deficiency:**
    *   **Angular Stomatitis:** Fissures at the angles of the mouth.
    *   **Cheilosis:** Fissuring and dry scaling of the lip surface.
    *   **Glossitis:** Tongue appears red/purple ([[Magenta Tongue]]).
    *   **Corneal Vascularization:** Invasion of cornea by capillaries.

#### **3. Niacin (Vitamin B3)**
*   **Precursor:** The body can synthesize Niacin from the essential amino acid [[Tryptophan]].
    *   *Conversion Rule:* **60 mg of Tryptophan = 1 mg of Niacin**.
*   **Deficiency Disease:** [[Pellagra]].
*   **Clinical Features of Pellagra (The 4 D's):**
    1.  **D**iarrhoea
    2.  **D**ermatitis (Symmetrical, sun-exposed areas). **[[Casal's Necklace]]**: A characteristic rash around the neck.
    3.  **D**ementia (Mental changes, irritability, delirium).
    4.  **D**eath (if untreated).
*   **Dietary Etiology:** Common in populations consuming **Maize** (low tryptophan) or **Jowar/Sorghum** (high **Leucine** content). Excess Leucine interferes with the conversion of Tryptophan to Niacin.

#### **4. Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6)**
*   **Function:** Metabolism of amino acids, fats, and carbohydrates.
*   **Clinical Relevance:** [[Isoniazid (INH)]], a drug used for **Tuberculosis**, antagonizes Vitamin B6. Patients on INH therapy must be supplemented with Pyridoxine (10-20 mg/day) to prevent **Peripheral Neuropathy**.

#### **5. Folic Acid (Vitamin B9)**
*   **Function:** Synthesis of DNA and normal development of blood cells.
*   **Sources:** Green leafy vegetables, liver, pulses.
*   **Deficiency:**
    *   **Megaloblastic Anemia** (Large, immature RBCs).
    *   **Neural Tube Defects (NTD):** Deficiency during early pregnancy causes spina bifida etc.
*   **Prophylaxis:**
    *   **Pregnancy:** 500 mcg/day.
    *   **Anemia Mukt Bharat:** Iron + Folic acid supplementation strategy for different age groups (e.g., 45mg Fe + 400mcg FA for children 5-9 yrs).

#### **6. Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin)**
*   **Unique Feature:** Found **ONLY** in foods of animal origin (Liver, meat, fish, milk, eggs). Not found in vegetables.
*   **Function:** DNA synthesis, myelin synthesis. Requires **Intrinsic Factor** (from stomach) for absorption in the terminal ileum.
*   **Deficiency:**
    *   [[Pernicious Anemia]] (Megaloblastic anemia).
    *   Neurological lesions (Subacute combined degeneration of the cord).
    *   **Risk Group:** Strict Vegetarians (Vegans).

#### **7. Pantothenic Acid (Vitamin B5)**
*   **Deficiency:** **[[Burning Feet Syndrome]]** (paresthesia and burning sensation in feet).

---

### **Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)**

*   **Characteristics:** Most sensitive vitamin; easily destroyed by heat (cooking) and oxidation.
*   **Functions:**
    *   Formation of **Collagen** (intercellular cement).
    *   Wound healing.
    *   **Antioxidant**.
    *   Enhances absorption of **Iron** from the intestine (keeps iron in ferrous state).
*   **Sources:**
    *   **Richest:** [[Amla]] (Indian Gooseberry) and Guava.
    *   **Good:** Citrus fruits, sprouted pulses, green leafy vegetables.
    *   **Poor:** Milk, Egg, Meat.

#### **Deficiency Disease: [[Scurvy]]**
*   **Pathology:** Defective collagen formation leading to capillary fragility.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Swollen, spongy, bleeding **gums** (Gingivitis).
    *   Petechiae, ecchymoses, and bruising.
    *   Delayed wound healing.
    *   **Infantile Scurvy:** Subperiosteal hemorrhage leading to pain and **Pseudoparalysis** (baby lies in 'frog leg' position).
