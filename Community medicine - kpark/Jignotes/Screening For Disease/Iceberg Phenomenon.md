# [[Screening For Disease]] > Iceberg Phenomenon

### Iceberg Phenomenon of Disease

The **[[Iceberg Phenomenon]]** gives a better idea of the progress of a disease from its sub-clinical stages to overt or apparent disease than the spectrum of disease. It states that disease in a community can be compared to an iceberg, where a significant portion remains hidden from view,.

#### 1. Components of the Iceberg

The concept divides the disease burden in a community into two main distinct sections separated by a "waterline".

*   **The Floating Tip (Visible Portion):**
    *   Represents what the **physician** sees in clinical practice.
    *   Consists of **[[Clinical cases]]** which are symptomatic, diagnosed, and under treatment.
    *   This is often the focus of curative medicine.

*   **The Waterline:**
    *   Represents the **demarcation** between apparent and inapparent disease.

*   **The Submerged Portion (Hidden Portion):**
    *   Represents the **[[Hidden mass of disease]]**.
    *   This portion is much larger than the tip and consists of:
        *   **Latent** infections.
        *   **Inapparent / Sub-clinical** cases.
        *   **Pre-symptomatic** cases.
        *   **Undiagnosed** cases.
        *   **[[Carriers]]** (in infectious diseases),.
    *   This is the domain of the **[[Epidemiologist]]** and **Preventive Medicine**.

#### 2. Comparison: Clinician vs. Epidemiologist

| Feature | Tip of Iceberg | Submerged Portion |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Status of Disease** | Apparent / Clinical | Inapparent / Sub-clinical / Latent |
| **Population** | Patients seeking care | Apparently healthy individuals |
| **Primary Observer** | **[[Clinician]]** | **[[Epidemiologist]]** |
| **Main Action** | Diagnosis and Treatment | **[[Screening]]** and Surveillance |
| **Examples** | Frank Measles rash, Paralytic Polio | Incubating HIV, Hypertension (Asymptomatic) |

#### 3. Disease Examples

The iceberg phenomenon is applicable to both communicable and non-communicable diseases:

*   **Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs):**
    *   **[[Hypertension]]:** Often cited as the classic example (Rule of Halves). A vast majority remain undiagnosed or inadequately treated.
    *   **Diabetes:** Many remain in the pre-diabetic or asymptomatic phase for years.
    *   **[[Anemia]]:** Clinical pallor is the tip; low hemoglobin stores are the submerged mass.
    *   **Malnutrition:** **[[Kwashiorkor]]** and Marasmus are the tip; mild to moderate malnutrition is the submerged part.
    *   **Mental Illness:** Diagnosed cases vs. undiagnosed psychosocial stress.

*   **Communicable Diseases:**
    *   **[[Poliomyelitis]]:** For every 1 clinical case (paralytic), there may be 1000 subclinical cases in children.
    *   **Hepatitis A:** Anicteric (without jaundice) cases far outnumber icteric cases, especially in children.

#### 4. Exceptions to the Phenomenon

Not all diseases show the iceberg phenomenon. In these diseases, clinical manifestations occur in almost everyone who gets infected (the submerged portion is negligible or non-existent).

**Diseases NOT showing Iceberg Phenomenon:**
1.  **[[Rabies]]**
2.  **[[Measles]]**
3.  **[[Rubella]]**
4.  **[[Tetanus]]**

> **Mnemonic for Exceptions:**
> **"M.R. T**eam has **No Iceberg"**
> *   **M** - **M**easles
> *   **R** - **R**ubella / **R**abies
> *   **T** - **T**etanus

#### 5. Clinical Relevance

*   **Clinician's Fallacy:** Studying only the hospitalized cases (the tip) leads to an inaccurate view of the nature and causes of a disease because the severity and presentation in the community (submerged part) are different.
*   **Screening:** The primary tool used to detect the submerged portion of the iceberg is **[[Screening]]**.
*   **Surveillance:** Essential to identify hidden carriers who maintain the chain of transmission.
