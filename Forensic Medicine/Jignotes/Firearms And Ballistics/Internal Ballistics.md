# [[Firearms And Ballistics]] > Internal Ballistics

### [[Internal Ballistics]] (Proximal Ballistics)

**Internal Ballistics** is the branch of [[Forensic Ballistics]] that deals with the study of the motion of the projectile while it is still **inside the firearm**. It covers the time from the striking of the firing pin on the primer until the projectile leaves the muzzle of the weapon.

### 1. Anatomy of the Barrel and Bore
The internal structure of the firearm barrel dictates the behavior of the projectile.

#### A. [[Rifling]]
Found in rifles, pistols, and revolvers.
*   **Definition:** Spiral grooves cut into the inner surface of the barrel.
*   **Lands:** The raised portions between the grooves.
*   **Grooves:** The depressed channels cut into the metal.
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Imparts a **rotational spin** to the bullet around its longitudinal axis.
    *   Provides **Gyroscopic Stability**, preventing the bullet from tumbling (end-over-end rotation) and ensuring accuracy and range.
*   **Twist:** The direction of the spiral can be Right-handed (Clockwise) or Left-handed (Anti-clockwise).

#### B. [[Bore]] and [[Calibre]]
*   **Rifled Weapons:**
    *   The diameter is measured between two **opposite lands**.
    *   Recorded in inches (e.g., .303, .22) or millimeters (e.g., 9mm, 7.62mm).
*   **Smooth Bore Weapons (Shotguns):**
    *   Measured by **Gauge** (or Bore).
    *   **Definition of Gauge:** The number of spherical lead balls, each exactly fitting the barrel, that can be made from **one pound of lead**.
    *   *Example:* In a 12-gauge shotgun, 12 lead balls of that barrel diameter weigh 1 pound. (Exception: .410 muskets are measured in inches).

#### C. [[Choking]] (Specific to Shotguns)
*   **Definition:** The constriction of the barrel bore at the muzzle end.
*   **Purpose:** To control the spread (dispersion) of the shot pellets, keeping them in a tighter group for a longer distance.
*   **Degrees of Choke:**
    1.  **Cylinder:** No constriction (widest spread).
    2.  **Improved Cylinder:** Slight constriction.
    3.  **Modified:** Moderate constriction.
    4.  **Full Choke:** Maximum constriction (tightest shot pattern).
*   **Paradox Gun:** A shotgun with rifling only at the muzzle end (for firing solid slugs).

### 2. The Ammunition (The Projectile Assembly)
Understanding the components inside the chamber is vital for internal ballistics.

#### A. [[Cartridge]]
The complete unit consisting of the case, primer, propellant, and projectile.

#### B. [[Primer]] (Percussion Cap)
*   **Function:** Impact-sensitive explosive that ignites the main powder.
*   **Composition (Mnemonic: LBA):**
    *   **L**ead Peroxide / Lead Styphnate.
    *   **B**arium Nitrate.
    *   **A**ntimony Sulphide.
    *   *Trace Evidence:* Detection of these elements on hands (Gunshot Residue - [[GSR]]) indicates the person fired a gun.

#### C. [[Gunpowder]] (Propellant)
| Feature | **Black Powder** | **Smokeless Powder** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Composition** | **KSC**: **K**NO3 (75%), **S**ulphur (10%), **C**harcoal (15%) | **Nitrocellulose** based |
| **Combustion** | Incomplete | Complete |
| **Smoke** | Heavy white smoke | Minimal/Grey smoke |
| **Residue** | Heavy fouling in barrel | Minimal residue |
| **Types** | Gunpowder | Single Base (Nitrocellulose)<br>Double Base (+ Nitroglycerine)<br>Triple Base (+ Nitroguanidine) |

#### D. Wads (In Shotguns)
*   **Materials:** Felt, cardboard, or plastic.
*   **Functions:**
    1.  **Separation:** Separates powder from pellets.
    2.  **Lubrication:** Cleans the barrel.
    3.  **Obturation:** Seals gas behind the pellets to prevent leakage.
    4.  **Piston Action:** Pushes the shot mass out.

### 3. Mechanism of Discharge (Sequence of Events)
When the trigger is pulled, the following sequence occurs within milliseconds:
1.  **Impact:** The firing pin/hammer strikes the **primer cap** at the base of the cartridge.
2.  **Ignition:** The primer detonates, sending a flash through the flash hole into the cartridge case.
3.  **Deflagration:** The **propellant (gunpowder)** ignites and burns rapidly (it does not explode, it deflagrates).
4.  **Gas Expansion:** Solid powder converts to gas (expansion ratio approx. 1:1000 for black powder), creating immense **chamber pressure**.
5.  **Motion:** The pressure forces the projectile (bullet/shot) to detach from the casing and accelerate down the barrel.
6.  **Engagement:**
    *   *Rifled:* The soft metal of the bullet is forced into the grooves, acquiring spin.
    *   *Smoothbore:* The wad pushes the pellets out.
7.  **Exit:** The projectile exits the muzzle, followed by gases, soot, and unburnt powder.
8.  **Recoil:** The gun moves backward (Newton's 3rd Law) due to the forward momentum of the ejecta.

### 4. Forensic and Medicolegal Aspects

#### A. Identification of the Weapon (Ballistic Fingerprinting)
Internal ballistics creates unique "signatures" on the fired components, allowing experts to match a bullet or cartridge case to a specific gun.

**1. On the Bullet (Rifling Marks):**
*   **Class Characteristics:** General features like **Calibre**, number of lands/grooves, direction of twist (left or right), and width of lands. This identifies the *make and model* of the gun.
*   **Individual Characteristics:** **Striations** (microscopic scratches) on the bullet caused by tool marks and imperfections inside the barrel. These are unique to a *specific* gun (like a fingerprint).
    *   *Procedure:* A **Test Bullet** is fired from the suspect gun into water/cotton and compared with the **Crime Bullet** using a [[Comparison Microscope]].

**2. On the Cartridge Case:**
*   **Firing Pin Impression:** The dent on the primer cap has microscopic irregularities unique to the firing pin.
*   **Breech Face Marks:** Marks impressed on the base of the cartridge as it slams back against the breech block due to recoil.
*   **Extractor/Ejector Marks:** Scratches left on the rim/side of the case when it is pulled out of the chamber.

#### B. Medicolegal Significance of Components
*   **Wads:** Can indicate the gauge of the shotgun and the make of ammunition. In close-range shots, wads may enter the body and act as a secondary projectile.
*   **Unburnt Powder:** Causes **Tattooing** (stippling) on the skin, helping to determine the [[Range of Fire]].
*   **Smoke/Soot:** Causes **Blackening** on the skin, indicating very close range.
