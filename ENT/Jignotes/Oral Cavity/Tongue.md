# [[Oral Cavity]] > Tongue

### **Anatomy and Physiology of the Tongue**

The **Tongue** is a mobile muscular organ situated in the floor of the mouth and the anterior wall of the pharynx. It plays a vital role in mastication, deglutition (swallowing), speech, taste, and oral cleansing.

### **1. Embryology**

The tongue develops from the floor of the pharynx in relation to the pharyngeal arches.

*   **Anterior 2/3 (Oral Part):** Derived from the **1st Branchial Arch**.
    *   Formed by the fusion of two lateral [[Lingual Swellings]] and a midline [[Tuberculum Impar]].
*   **Posterior 1/3 (Pharyngeal Part):** Derived from the **3rd Branchial Arch**.
    *   Formed by the cranial part of the [[Hypobranchial Eminence]] (copula).
    *   *Note:* The 3rd arch overgrows the 2nd arch, excluding it from tongue formation.
*   **Posterior-most part:** Derived from the **4th Branchial Arch**.
*   **Musculature:** Derived from [[Occipital Myotomes]].

### **2. Gross Anatomy**

The tongue is divided into two parts by a V-shaped groove called the **[[Sulcus Terminalis]]**.

| Part | Location | Origin | Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Oral Part** | Anterior 2/3 | 1st Arch | Rough surface due to papillae; freely mobile. |
| **Pharyngeal Part** (Base) | Posterior 1/3 | 3rd Arch | Smooth, nodular surface due to [[Lingual Tonsils]]; mucous glands present. |

*   **Apex:** The [[Foramen Cecum]] lies at the apex of the sulcus terminalis. It is the site of the embryological origin of the [[Thyroglossal Duct]] (Thyroid gland development).
*   **Surfaces:**
    *   **Dorsal Surface:** Conveyed by stratifies squamous epithelium; contains papillae.
    *   **Ventral Surface:** Smooth; connected to the floor of the mouth by the [[Frenulum Linguae]]. The [[Sublingual Fold]] and openings of the [[Submandibular Duct]] are visible here.

### **3. Papillae and Taste Buds**

Projections of connective tissue covered by epithelium found on the anterior two-thirds.

1.  **[[Circumvallate Papillae]]:**
    *   Arranged in a V-shape just *anterior* to the sulcus terminalis.
    *   Largest in size; contain numerous [[Taste Buds]].
    *   Innervated by the **Glossopharyngeal nerve** (CN IX) despite being in the anterior 2/3.
2.  **[[Fungiform Papillae]]:**
    *   Mushroom-shaped, bright red (vascular).
    *   Concentrated at the **tip and margins** of the tongue.
    *   Contain taste buds.
3.  **[[Filiform Papillae]]:**
    *   Most numerous; cover the dorsum.
    *   Thread-like, keratinized, whitish appearance.
    *   **No taste buds**; function is tactile (touch) and friction for food manipulation.
4.  **[[Foliate Papillae]]:**
    *   Located on lateral margins; rudimentary in humans.

### **4. Musculature**

A median fibrous septum divides the tongue into right and left halves.

#### **A. Intrinsic Muscles**
Responsible for altering the **shape** of the tongue.
*   [[Superior Longitudinal Muscle]]
*   [[Inferior Longitudinal Muscle]]
*   [[Transverse Muscle]]
*   [[Vertical Muscle]]

#### **B. Extrinsic Muscles**
Responsible for altering the **position** of the tongue.
*   **[[Genioglossus]]:** Protrudes the tongue (safety muscle—prevents tongue fall back).
*   **[[Hyoglossus]]:** Depresses the tongue.
*   **[[Styloglossus]]:** Retracts and elevates the tongue.
*   **[[Palatoglossus]]:** Elevates the posterior part of the tongue.

### **5. Nerve Supply**

This is a high-yield topic for examinations due to the tongue's complex embryological origin.

| Modality | Region | Nerve |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Motor Supply** | All Muscles | **[[Hypoglossal Nerve]] (CN XII)** |
| | *Exception: Palatoglossus* | **Pharyngeal Plexus (CN X)** |
| **Sensory (General)** | Anterior 2/3 | **[[Lingual Nerve]]** (Branch of V3) |
| | Posterior 1/3 | **[[Glossopharyngeal Nerve]] (CN IX)** |
| | Posterior-most / Vallecula | **[[Internal Laryngeal Nerve]]** (Branch of CN X) |
| **Sensory (Taste)** | Anterior 2/3 | **[[Chorda Tympani]]** (Branch of CN VII) |
| | Posterior 1/3 (incl. Circumvallate) | **[[Glossopharyngeal Nerve]] (CN IX)** |
| | Posterior-most | **[[Internal Laryngeal Nerve]] (CN X)** |

**Mnemonic for Motor Supply:** "The **Palatoglossus** is pulled by the **Pharynx** (Vagus), the rest are hyped up (Hypoglossal)."

---

### **6. Vascular Supply**

*   **Arterial Supply:** Mainly by the **[[Lingual Artery]]** (a branch of the External Carotid Artery).
    *   It passes deep to the hyoglossus muscle.
    *   Branches: Dorsalis linguae, sublingual artery, and deep lingual artery (profunda).
*   **Venous Drainage:**
    *   Dorsal lingual veins and Deep lingual veins drain into the **[[Internal Jugular Vein]]**.

---

### **7. Lymphatic Drainage**

Lymphatic drainage is crucial for understanding the metastasis of tongue cancers. The tip drains bilaterally, while the sides drain unilaterally. Eventually, all drain into the deep cervical nodes.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a schematic of the tongue mapping these lymphatic zones to the respective nodes

| Part of Tongue | Primary Nodes | Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tip** | **[[Submental Nodes]]** (Bilateral drainage) | Level I |
| **Lateral Margins (Ant 2/3)** | **[[Submandibular Nodes]]** (Ipsilateral) | Level I |
| **Central Part (Ant 2/3)** | Deep Cervical Nodes (Bilateral) | Level II/III |
| **Posterior 1/3 (Base)** | **[[Jugulodigastric Nodes]]** (Upper Deep Cervical) | Level II |

**Clinical Implication:**
*   Carcinoma of the **lateral border** often metastasizes to the **Submandibular** and **Jugulodigastric** nodes.
*   Since the tongue has a rich cross-lymphatic network (especially the tip and center), contralateral or bilateral metastasis is common.

### **8. Clinical Conditions**

*   **[[Ankyloglossia]] (Tongue Tie):**
    *   Short, thick, or tight **lingual frenulum** restricts tongue movement.
    *   Can affect speech (articulation) and feeding.
    *   **Treatment:** Frenotomy or Frenuloplasty.

*   **[[Macroglossia]] (Large Tongue):**
    *   Causes: Down syndrome, Hypothyroidism (Cretinism), Hemangioma, Lymphangioma, Acromegaly, Amyloidosis.

*   **[[Glossitis]]:**
    *   Inflammation/depapillation of the tongue.
    *   **Beefy Red Tongue:** Vitamin B12 deficiency.
    *   **Bald/Smooth Tongue:** Iron deficiency anemia, Median rhomboid glossitis.

*   **[[Geographic Tongue]] (Migratory Glossitis):**
    *   Erythematous areas (loss of filiform papillae) surrounded by white keratotic margins. Lesions change shape/location. Benign and asymptomatic.

*   **[[Hairy Tongue]]:**
    *   Hypertrophy/elongation of **filiform papillae** (black/brown color due to chromogenic bacteria). Associated with smoking and poor hygiene.

*   **[[Leukoplakia]] / [[Erythroplakia]]:**
    *   Premalignant white or red patches on the mucosa. Cannot be scraped off. Biopsy required to rule out malignancy.

*   **[[Carcinoma of Tongue]]:**
    *   **Type:** Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) is the most common (85-95%).
    *   **Site:** Lateral border of the anterior 2/3 is the most common site.
    *   **Symptoms:** Painful ulcer, ankyloglossia (fixation), referred otalgia (ear pain via CN IX or X), dysphagia.
    *   **Trotter’s Triad** (Nasopharyngeal Ca involving base of skull/tongue nerves): Conductive deafness, palatal paralysis, temporoparietal neuralgia.

*   **[[Hypoglossal Nerve Palsy]]:**
    *   Upon protrusion, the tongue deviates to the **paralyzed/affected side**.
    *   Reason: Unopposed action of the **Genioglossus** muscle on the healthy side pushes the tongue toward the weak side.
