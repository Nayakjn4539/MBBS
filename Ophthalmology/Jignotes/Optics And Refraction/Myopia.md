# [[Optics And Refraction]] > Myopia

### **Myopia (Short-Sightedness)**

**Definition**
Myopia, also known as [[Short-sightedness]] or Near-sightedness, is a type of refractive error in which parallel rays of light coming from infinity are focused **in front** of the light-sensitive layer of the [[retina]] when accommodation is at rest.
*   **Result:** The image formed on the retina is blurred, leading to indistinct distant vision.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw an eye showing parallel rays of light converging at a point anterior to the retina (vitreous cavity) and then diverging to form a blurred circle on the retina.

### **Etiology and Mechanism**
Myopia generally results from the eye having excessive refractive power for its axial length.

1.  **Axial Myopia (Most Common):**
    *   Due to an increase in the anteroposterior length of the eyeball.
    *   **Rule of Thumb:** 1 mm increase in [[axial length]] produces approximately **3 Diopters (3D)** of myopia.
2.  **Curvatural Myopia:**
    *   Due to increased curvature of the [[cornea]] or [[lens]].
    *   **Causes:** [[Keratoconus]], [[Lenticonus]], [[Spherophakia]].
    *   **Rule of Thumb:** 1 mm decrease in radius of curvature results in **6 Diopters (6D)** of myopia.
3.  **Index Myopia:**
    *   Due to an increase in the refractive index of the crystalline lens.
    *   **Clinical Example:** Nuclear [[sclerosis]] (early senile [[cataract]]).
4.  **Positional Myopia:**
    *   Due to anterior displacement of the lens.
    *   **Causes:** Anterior subluxation of the lens, [[Weill-Marchesani syndrome]].
5.  **Excessive Accommodation (Pseudomyopia):**
    *   Due to spasm of the ciliary muscle (spasm of [[accommodation]]).
    *   Common in young individuals doing excessive near work.

### **Classification**

#### **1. Clinical Classification**
| Type | Characteristics | Refractive Error |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Congenital Myopia** | Present since birth. Often associated with anomalies like [[microphthalmos]] or [[cataract]]. | Usually high (8–10D), remains constant. |
| **Simple / Developmental Myopia** | Most common type ("School Myopia"). Physiological variation. Onset 5–10 years, stabilizes by 20 years. | Low to Moderate (< 6D). |
| **Pathological / Degenerative Myopia** | Rapidly progressive, hereditary. Associated with degenerative changes in the posterior segment. | High (> 6D, often -10 to -40D). |
| **Acquired / Secondary Myopia** | Secondary to other conditions (Trauma, Keratitis, Diabetes, Nuclear sclerosis, Drugs like Sulphonamides). | Variable. |

#### **2. Grading of Myopia**
*   **Low Myopia:** < -3.00 D
*   **Moderate Myopia:** -3.00 D to -6.00 D
*   **High Myopia:** > -6.00 D

### **Clinical Features**

#### **Symptoms**
1.  **Indistinct Distant Vision:** The hallmark symptom. Patients see near objects clearly but distant objects are blurred.
2.  **Half-shutting of eyes:** Patients often squeeze their eyelids to achieve a **stenopaeic (pinhole) effect**, which improves visual clarity by cutting off peripheral rays.
3.  **Asthenopia:** Eye strain is less common than in [[hypermetropia]] but may occur due to convergence insufficiency.
4.  **Muscae Volitantes (Floaters):** Black floating spots due to vitreous liquefaction/syneresis, common in high myopia.
5.  **Night Blindness:** May occur in very high myopes with degenerative changes.

#### **Signs (Examination)**
1.  **Eyeballs:** May appear prominent (large eyes).
2.  **Cornea:** Large cornea.
3.  **Anterior Chamber:** Deep.
4.  **Pupil:** Slightly large and sluggish.
5.  **Refraction:** Retinoscopy reveals a "myopic" or "against" movement (with plane mirror at 1m if >1D).
6.  **Ocular Motility:** Tendency for **Divergent Squint** ([[Exophoria]]/[[Exotropia]]) because accommodation is not used, leading to disuse of convergence.

### **Pathological Myopia (Degenerative Myopia)**
High myopia associated with degenerative changes in the eye, particularly the posterior segment. It is strongly hereditary and progressive.

**Fundus Changes (Ophthalmoscopy):**
1.  **Optic Disc:**
    *   Large and pale.
    *   **Temporal Myopia Crescent:** White crescent at the temporal border due to chorioretinal atrophy exposing the sclera.
    *   **Supertraction Crescent:** Retina pulled over the nasal edge of the disc.
    *   **Tilted Disc:** Due to oblique entry of the optic nerve.
2.  **Macula:**
    *   **Foster-Fuchs Spot:** A dark red/pigmented circular spot at the macula due to proliferation of pigment epithelium following subretinal neovascularization and hemorrhage.
    *   **Macular Hole:** Can lead to central vision loss.
3.  **Choroid and Retina:**
    *   **Tessellated / Tigroid Fundus:** The fundus appears tessellated (patterned) because the thinning of the retinal pigment epithelium ([[RPE]]) makes large choroidal vessels visible.
    *   **Lacquer Cracks:** Linear breaks in [[Bruch's membrane]]. They appear as yellowish-white irregular lines and predispose to CNVM.
    *   **Lattice Degeneration:** Peripheral retinal thinning and degeneration, predisposes to retinal breaks.
4.  **Sclera:**
    *   **Posterior Staphyloma:** Ectasia (bulging) of the sclera at the posterior pole. The vessels appear to bend backward over the margin.
5.  **Vitreous:**
    *   Liquefaction ([[Synchysis]]), collapse ([[Syneresis]]), and Posterior Vitreous Detachment ([[PVD]]) seen as Weiss ring.

**Complications of High Myopia:**
*   **Retinal Detachment (RD):** Rhegmatogenous RD due to peripheral breaks/holes is the most serious complication.
*   **Cataract:** Complicated cataract (Posterior subcapsular) and early onset nuclear sclerosis.
*   **Glaucoma:** Primary Open Angle Glaucoma ([[POAG]]) is more common in myopes.
*   **Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV):** Can lead to severe central vision loss.

### **Treatment and Management**

#### **1. Optical Correction**
*   **Spectacles:** Concave lenses (Minus lenses) are prescribed.
    *   **Principle:** Diverge the incident rays so they focus on the retina.
    *   **Rule:** Prescribe the **minimum minus power** that gives maximum visual acuity (best vision) to avoid stimulating accommodation.
*   **Contact Lenses:**
    *   Provide a larger image size and wider field of view compared to spectacles.
    *   Eliminate spherical aberrations and prismatic effects.
    *   Preferred in high myopia and [[anisometropia]].

#### **2. Refractive Surgery**
Indicated for cosmetic reasons or intolerance to glasses/contacts. Ideally performed after 18-21 years when refraction is stable.

*   **Corneal Procedures (Laser Ablation):**
    *   **[[PRK]] (Photorefractive Keratectomy):** Laser ablation of anterior stroma after removing epithelium. Good for low myopia.
    *   **[[LASIK]] (Laser-Assisted In-Situ Keratomileusis):** A flap is created, and the underlying stroma is ablated to flatten the cornea. Preferred for moderate to high myopia (up to -8D to -10D).
    *   **[[SMILE]] (Small Incision Lenticule Extraction):** Femtosecond laser creates a lenticule within the stroma which is removed through a small incision.
*   **Intraocular Procedures:**
    *   **Phakic IOL ([[ICL]]):** Implantable Collamer Lens placed in the posterior chamber (sulcus) in front of the natural lens. Used for very high myopia (> -8D to -20D).
    *   **Refractive Lens Exchange (Clear Lens Extraction):** Removal of the clear crystalline lens and replacement with an IOL. Risk of RD is high.
*   **Other Procedures:**
    *   **[[Radial Keratotomy]] (RK):** (Historical) Deep radial incisions to flatten the cornea.
    *   **[[INTACS]] (Intrastromal Corneal Ring Segments):** Used for low myopia and keratoconus.

#### **3. General & Preventive Measures**
*   **Visual Hygiene:** Proper illumination, distance, and posture during near work.
*   **Pharmacological Control:** Low dose **Atropine (0.01%)** eye drops at night are used to retard the progression of myopia in children.
*   **Outdoor Activity:** Increased time outdoors is associated with reduced onset of myopia.

### **Clinical Implication**
**Why scan the periphery?**
In all cases of high myopia, a dilated fundus examination using an **Indirect Ophthalmoscope** is mandatory to look for peripheral retinal degenerations (lattice, holes). Prophylactic laser photocoagulation of these lesions can prevent [[Retinal Detachment]].
