# Osteomalacia

### Definition
[[Osteomalacia]] is a generalized metabolic bone disease characterized by the softening of bones due to defective **mineralization** of the organic matrix ([[osteoid]]). It is the adult equivalent of [[Rickets]] (which occurs in the growing skeleton).

Unlike [[Osteoporosis]], where there is a decrease in the absolute mass of bone (both matrix and mineral), [[Osteomalacia]] presents with a normal amount of bone matrix but insufficient mineral deposition (low calcium/phosphorus ratio).

### Etiology and Risk Factors
The condition is primarily caused by a deficiency in [[Vitamin D]] or a disturbance in its metabolism.

*   **Nutritional Deficiency:**
    *   Lack of Vitamin D in diet.
    *   Inadequate exposure to sunlight (essential for synthesis of [[Cholecalciferol]]).
    *   Common in purdah-observing women or housebound elderly.
*   **Malabsorption Syndromes:**
    *   [[Celiac disease]], Sprue, post-gastrectomy states leading to poor absorption of Vitamin D and Calcium.
*   **Renal Disorders:**
    *   [[Renal Osteodystrophy]]: Chronic renal failure leads to defective 1-alpha hydroxylation of Vitamin D.
    *   **Renal Tubular Acidosis**: Loss of phosphate.
*   **Drug-Induced:**
    *   Long-term use of anticonvulsants (e.g., Phenytoin) which accelerate Vitamin D metabolism.

### Pathophysiology
1.  Deficiency of active [[Vitamin D]] ([[Calcitriol]]).
2.  Reduced absorption of **Calcium** and **Phosphate** from the gut.
3.  Low serum calcium stimulates the [[Parathyroid Gland]] (Secondary [[Hyperparathyroidism]]).
4.  [[Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)]] increases, causing mobilization of calcium from bone and phosphaturia (loss of phosphate in urine).
5.  **Result:** The [[calcium-phosphate product]] in the blood drops below the critical level required for precipitation.
6.  **Bone Histology:** Osteoblasts continue to produce collagen (osteoid), but it fails to calcify. This leads to the accumulation of wide, unmineralized **osteoid seams**.

### Clinical Features
Patients, typically adults or the elderly, present with insidious progression of symptoms:
*   **Skeletal Pain:** Diffuse, vague aches in the lower back, hips, and ribs. Bones are tender on palpation (especially the tibia and ribs).
*   **Muscle Weakness:** Proximal myopathy (weakness of hip girdle muscles) leading to difficulty climbing stairs or getting up from a squatting position.
*   **Gait:** A characteristic **waddling gait** (resembling a duck).
*   **Deformities:**
    *   Kyphosis (hunchback).
    *   Coxa vara.
    *   Protrusio acetabuli.
    *   Bowing of tibiae.

### Radiological Features
Radiological findings are crucial for diagnosis. The bones appear generally radiolucent (osteopenia) with loss of distinct trabecular patterns.

#### 1. Looser's Zones (The Hallmark Sign)
Also known as **Pseudofractures** or **Milkman's Fractures**. These are pathognomonic of osteomalacia.

*   **Appearance:** Narrow, radiolucent bands running perpendicular to the cortex. They are often symmetrical and may have sclerotic margins.
*   **Pathology:** These represent stress fractures that have been repaired by fibrous tissue (osteoid) but have failed to mineralize.
*   **Common Locations:**
    *   [[Axillary border of scapula]].
    *   [[Ribs]].
    *   [[Pubic rami]].
    *   Medial cortex of the [[Femoral neck]].
    *   Ischium.

#### 2. Skeletal Deformities
*   **Codfish Vertebrae:** The intervertebral discs bulge into the softened vertebral bodies, making the vertebrae appear biconcave (fish-mouth appearance).
*   **Trefoil Pelvis:** Also known as **Champagne Glass Pelvis**. The pressure from the femoral heads pushes the acetabula inward (protrusio acetabuli), causing the pelvic cavity to become triangular or trefoil in shape.

### Laboratory Findings (Biochemical Profile)
The biochemical picture is distinct and helps differentiate from osteoporosis and other metabolic disorders.

| Parameter | Finding in Osteomalacia | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Serum Calcium** | Normal or Low | Compensated by secondary hyperparathyroidism. |
| **Serum Phosphate** | **Low** | Increased urinary excretion due to high PTH. |
| **Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)** | **High** | Increased osteoblastic activity attempting repair. |
| **Serum PTH** | **High** | Secondary response to low calcium. |
| **Urine Calcium** | Low | Body attempts to conserve calcium. |
| **Vitamin D levels** | Low | Primary deficiency. |

**Clinical Implication:**
If a patient presents with generalized body pain and the labs show **High ALP** with **Low/Normal Calcium**, strongly suspect Osteomalacia over Osteoporosis (where labs are typically normal).

### Treatment
The goal is to replenish mineral stores and correct the underlying deficiency.

1.  **Vitamin D Supplementation:**
    *   Daily administration of Vitamin D (e.g., 2000–5000 IU) or therapeutic doses of [[Cholecalciferol]] (600,000 IU) followed by maintenance.
    *   Active metabolites ([[Calcitriol]]) are required for patients with renal osteodystrophy.
2.  **Calcium Supplementation:** Essential to mineralize the osteoid.
3.  **Treat Underlying Cause:** E.g., gluten-free diet for celiac disease.
4.  **Monitoring:** Treatment response is monitored by a drop in Alkaline Phosphatase levels and healing of Looser's zones on X-ray.
