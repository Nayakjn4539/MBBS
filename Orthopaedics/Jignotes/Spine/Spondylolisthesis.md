# [[Spondylolisthesis]]

### Definition and Terminology
**Spondylolisthesis** is derived from the Greek words *spondylos* (vertebra) and *olisthesis* (slipping/falling). It is defined as the forward displacement (slippage) of one vertebra over the one below it.

**Related Terms:**
*   **[[Spondylosis]]:** A general term for degenerative changes in the spine (intervertebral disc degeneration and osteophyte formation).
*   **[[Spondylolysis]]:** A defect or break in the [[pars interarticularis]] (the isthmus of bone between the superior and inferior articular facets) *without* vertebral slippage.
*   **[[Spondyloptosis]]:** A severe form of spondylolisthesis (Grade V) where the vertebral body has completely slipped off the one below it (>100% displacement).

### Etiology and Classification (Wiltse Classification)
The condition is classified based on the etiology of the slip.

| Type | Name | Pathology | Common Site |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type I** | **Dysplastic (Congenital)** | Congenital deficiency/malformation of the [[facet joints]] or neural arch (e.g., spina bifida) allowing forward slip. | L5-S1 |
| **Type II** | **Isthmic (Spondylolytic)** | Lesion is in the [[pars interarticularis]]. Most common type overall. Subdivided into: <br> A. **Lytic:** Fatigue fracture of pars. <br> B. **Elongated:** Intact but stretched pars. <br> C. **Acute:** Acute fracture of pars. | L5-S1 |
| **Type III** | **Degenerative** | Due to long-standing intersegmental instability from disc and facet joint degeneration. The pars is **intact**. | L4-L5 (Common in elderly/females) |
| **Type IV** | **Traumatic** | Acute fracture of the neural arch (pedicles/facets) *other than* the pars. | Any level |
| **Type V** | **Pathologic** | Generalized or localized bone disease (e.g., tumor, infection, [[osteoporosis]]) destroying the pars. | Any level |
| **Type VI** | **Iatrogenic** | Post-surgical instability (e.g., after extensive laminectomy). | Post-surgical site |

### Pathophysiology
*   **Mechanism:** The normal locking mechanism of laminae and facets fails.
*   **Isthmic Type:** Usually caused by fatigue/stress fractures in childhood/adolescence due to repetitive extension (e.g., gymnasts), but symptoms may appear in adulthood.
*   **Degenerative Type:** The intervertebral disc degenerates and loses height, causing the facet joints to subluxate, allowing forward slip. Often associated with [[spinal stenosis]].

### Clinical Features
Patients may be asymptomatic, but when symptoms occur, they include:

**1. Symptoms**
*   **[[Low Back Pain]]:** The most common symptom. Usually mechanical, aggravated by standing, walking, or extension; relieved by rest/sitting.
*   **[[Sciatica]]:** Radiating pain into the buttocks and thighs due to nerve root irritation/compression (usually L5 root in L5-S1 slip).
*   **[[Neurogenic Claudication]]:** Pain, numbness, or heaviness in legs appearing after walking and relieved by sitting/bending forward (typical of degenerative spondylolisthesis/spinal stenosis).
*   **Hamstring Tightness:** A very common finding; causes a stilted or waddling gait.

**2. Physical Signs**
*   **[[Step Sign]]:** A palpable step-off or "shelf" felt over the spinous processes at the level of the slip. The spinous process of the upper vertebra moves forward, leaving the lower spinous process prominent.
*   **Posture:**
    *   Increased [[lumbar lordosis]].
    *   Transverse furrow/crease over the lower back.
    *   Protuberant abdomen.
*   **Straight Leg Raising Test ([[SLRT]]):** May be restricted due to hamstring spasm or nerve root tension.

### Imaging and Investigations

**1. X-rays (Gold Standard for Diagnosis)**
*   **Views:** Anteroposterior (AP), Lateral, and Oblique.
*   **Lateral View:** Shows the forward displacement and loss of disc height.
*   **Oblique View:** Diagnostic for **Spondylolysis**.
    *   **[[Scottish Terrier Sign]] (Scotty Dog):** The posterior elements resemble a dog.
    *   **Collar on the neck:** Represents a fracture of the pars interarticularis (spondylolysis).
    *   **Decapitated dog:** Represents severe slippage.
*   **AP View:**
    *   **[[Inverted Napoleon Hat Sign]]:** Seen in severe Grade V spondylolisthesis (Spondyloptosis) where L5 slips completely off S1.

**2. Advanced Imaging**
*   **MRI:** Best for evaluating nerve root compression, [[spinal cord]] status, and intervertebral disc health.
*   **CT Scan:** Best for defining bony anatomy, 3D orientation, and extent of the pars defect.

### Grading (Meyerding Classification)
Based on the percentage of the superior vertebral body that has slipped forward over the inferior vertebral body on a lateral X-ray.

| Grade | Percentage of Slip |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Grade I** | 0 – 25% |
| **Grade II** | 25 – 50% |
| **Grade III** | 50 – 75% |
| **Grade IV** | 75 – 100% |
| **Grade V** | > 100% (Spondyloptosis) |

### Treatment

#### 1. Conservative Management
Indicated for Grade I and II slips, or mild symptoms.
*   **Rest:** Avoidance of hyperextension activities and heavy lifting.
*   **Medication:** [[NSAIDs]] and muscle relaxants for pain relief.
*   **Physical Therapy:**
    *   **Flexion exercises** (William’s exercises) to strengthen abdominals and reduce lordosis.
    *   Hamstring stretching.
*   **Bracing:** Lumbosacral corset or brace to reduce lordosis and provide support.

#### 2. Operative Management
**Indications for Surgery:**
*   Slip > 50% (Grade III, IV, V).
*   Progressive slip in children.
*   Intractable pain failing conservative therapy.
*   Significant neurological deficit (motor weakness, bladder/bowel involvement).

**Surgical Procedures:**
*   **Decompression:** [[Laminectomy]] or Gill’s procedure (removal of loose posterior arch) to relieve nerve root compression.
    *   *Note:* Decompression alone in isthmic spondylolisthesis can increase instability.
*   **Stabilization/Fusion:**
    *   **[[Posterolateral Fusion]] (PLF):** Intertransverse fusion using bone grafts.
    *   **[[Interbody Fusion]] (PLIF/TLIF):** Placing a cage/graft in the disc space to restore height and fuse the anterior column.
    *   **Instrumentation:** Fixation with **pedicle screws and rods** to reduce the slip and hold the spine rigid while fusion occurs.

### Clinical Implications & Complications
*   **Cauda Equina Syndrome:** In severe slips, can cause bowel/bladder dysfunction requiring emergency decompression.
*   **Pseudoarthrosis:** Failure of fusion after surgery.
*   **Spondylolisthesis Crisis:** Severe pain, hamstring spasm, and inability to stand.
