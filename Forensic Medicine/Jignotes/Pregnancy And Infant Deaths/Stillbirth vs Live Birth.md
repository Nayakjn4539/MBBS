# [[Pregnancy And Infant Deaths]] > Stillbirth vs Live Birth

### Stillbirth vs Live Birth

The differentiation between a [[Stillbirth]] and a [[Live Birth]] is the most critical question in cases of alleged **infanticide**. It determines whether the child was legally a "person" capable of being murdered.

### 1. Definitions

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Live Birth** | The complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy, which, after such separation, breathes or shows any other evidence of life (e.g., beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles), whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached. |
| **Stillbirth** | A child born after the **28th week** of pregnancy (viable age), who did not breathe or show any other signs of life at any time after being completely born. Death occurs *during* the process of birth. |
| **Deadborn** | A fetus that has died *in utero* (before labor/birth process) and usually shows signs of **maceration**. |

> **Note:** In India, a child is considered "live born" if any part of its body has been brought forth and it shows signs of life, even if not completely expelled (Explanation to [[Sec 299 IPC]]). However, for **Infanticide**, complete emergence is usually required.

### 2. Autopsy Findings: Comparative Table

The most reliable evidence comes from the examination of the lungs and the chest cavity.

| Feature | Live Birth (Respired Lungs) | Stillbirth / Deadborn (Unrespired Lungs) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **External Chest** | **Arched** or drum-shaped (Barrel chest). Intercostal spaces wide. | **Flat** or depressed. Intercostal spaces narrow. |
| **Position of Diaphragm** | Lower: Level of **6th or 7th rib**. | Higher: Level of **4th or 5th rib**. |
| **Pleural Cavity** | Lungs **fill the cavity** and cover the heart (overlap pericardium). | Lungs are **collapsed**, lying at the back of the spine; Heart is exposed. |
| **Lung Volume** | Increased; bulky. | Small; contracted. |
| **Color** | **Mottled** or **Marbled** appearance (bright red/pink patches of expanded alveoli against dark red unexpanded areas). | Uniformly **dark red** or liver-like (resembles liver or spleen). |
| **Consistency** | **Soft, spongy**, elastic, and **crepitant** (crackling sound on pressure due to air). | **Firm, solid**, rubbery, and liver-like (non-crepitant). |
| **Margins/Edges** | **Rounded** and obtuse. | **Sharp** and well-defined. |
| **Weight** | Increased (due to blood influx). Approx **1/35** of body weight (60-70g). | Lighter. Approx **1/70** of body weight (30-40g). |
| **Cut Section** | Exudes **abundant frothy blood** (air + blood) on squeezing. | Exudes scanty **frothless blood**. |
| **Specific Gravity** | **0.90 to 1.05** (Lighter than water). | **1.04 to 1.05** (Heavier than water). |
| **Hydrostatic Test** | **Positive** (Lung floats in water). | **Negative** (Lung sinks in water). |
| **Histology** | Alveoli **distended/expanded**; lined by flat squamous epithelium. Prominent vascularity. | Alveoli **collapsed** (gland-like); lined by cuboidal/columnar epithelium. |

### 3. Tests for Live Birth

#### A. Hydrostatic Test (Raygat’s Test)
This is the most important test to determine if respiration took place.
*   **Principle:** Unrespired lungs have a specific gravity (1.05) higher than water and sink. Respired lungs contain residual air, lowering specific gravity (0.94), causing them to float.
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Ligatures are tied at the trachea. The entire block of organs (lungs + heart + thymus) is placed in water. **Result:** If it floats $\rightarrow$ Respiration likely.
    2.  Each lung is separated and placed in water.
    3.  Each lung is cut into 12-20 small pieces and placed in water.
    4.  **Compression Test:** Pieces are squeezed firmly (or crushed under foot) to remove decomposition gases and placed back in water.
    *   **Inference:** If pieces **float even after squeezing**, it is a sure sign of **Live Birth** (Residual air cannot be fully squeezed out).

**Mnemonic for Hydrostatic Test Limitations:** "PEE"
*   **P**utrefaction (False Positive): Decomposition gases make unrespired lungs float.
*   **E**xplosion/Artificial Inflation (False Positive): CPR can aerate lungs.
*   **E**xplosion (False Negative): Pathologies like pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or atelectasis may cause respired lungs to sink.

#### B. Static Test (Fodere's Test)
Based on the absolute weight of the lungs.
*   **Live Birth:** Weight increases due to increased pulmonary blood flow (approx. 60-70 gm).
*   **Stillbirth:** Lungs are lighter (approx. 30-40 gm).

#### C. Ploucquet’s Test
Based on the ratio of lung weight to body weight.
*   **Live Birth:** 1 : 35
*   **Stillbirth:** 1 : 70
*   *Note: This test is unreliable due to wide variations in body weight.*

#### D. Breslau’s Second Life Test (Stomach-Bowel Test)
Based on the swallowing of air (aerophagy) which accompanies respiration.
*   **Procedure:** Ligatures are applied at the cardiac and pyloric ends of the stomach and intervals along the intestine. The gut is removed and placed in water.
*   **Observation:** If the stomach/intestines float, it indicates air has been swallowed, suggesting live birth.
*   *Note:* Air reaches the stomach within **15-30 mins**, small intestine in **1-2 hours**, and large intestine in **5-6 hours**.

#### E. Wreden’s Test
Presence of gelatinous material in the middle ear indicates **Stillbirth**. This tissue disappears and is replaced by air after birth (signs of live birth).

### 4. Signs of Deadborn (Macerated) Fetus
If a fetus dies *in utero* and remains there for 3-4 days in sterile amniotic fluid, it undergoes aseptic autolysis known as **Maceration**.
*   **Smell:** Musty/sour (not putrid).
*   **Skin:** Reddish-brown, slips off easily ([[Skin Slippage]]).
*   **Body:** Soft, flaccid, flattened (flattening of buttocks/nose).
*   **Internal Organs:** Soft, edematous, loss of architecture (diffluent brain).
*   **[[Spalding's Sign]]:** Overriding of skull bones (seen on X-ray).
*   **[[Robert's Sign]]:** Gas in great vessels/heart (seen on X-ray).

### 5. Medico-Legal Aspects

1.  **Infanticide:** Unlawful killing of a newborn child. To prove infanticide, the prosecution must prove:
    *   The child was viable (usually >210 days/7 months gestation).
    *   The child was born **alive** (separate existence).
    *   The death was due to a willful act of omission or commission.
    *   *If the child was stillborn, there is no case of homicide.*
2.  **Concealment of Birth ([[Sec 318 IPC]]):** Secretly disposing of the dead body of a child (whether the child died before, after, or during birth) to conceal the birth.
3.  **Precipitate Labor:** Rapid expulsion of the fetus can sometimes cause head injuries or rupture of the cord, leading to accidental death, which may be mistaken for infanticide.
4.  **Civil Rights:** A live-born child (even if it lives only for a moment) acquires civil rights (inheritance, etc.), whereas a stillborn child does not.
