# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Epidemiological features, 4 categories, criteria, control of AIDS. Its Control programme of Govt. of INDIA

# **Epidemiology and Control of AIDS**

**Context:** [[Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome]] (AIDS) is a fatal illness caused by the [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus]] (HIV), which breaks down the body’s immune system, leaving the victim vulnerable to life-threatening opportunistic infections, neurological disorders, or unusual malignancies.

---

### **1. Epidemiological Features**

**A. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** HIV is a retrovirus (Lentivirus family). It contains RNA and the enzyme **Reverse Transcriptase**.
    *   **Types:** HIV-1 (Most common worldwide and in India) and HIV-2 (Less virulent, found in West Africa and parts of India).
    *   **Target:** The virus destroys **CD4+ T-helper lymphocytes**, leading to reversal of the Helper:Suppressor cell ratio.
*   **Reservoir of Infection:** Cases and carriers. Once infected, the person remains a carrier for life.
*   **Source of Infection:** Greatest concentration of virus is in **blood, semen, and CSF**. Lower concentrations in breast milk, vaginal secretions, saliva, and tears.
*   **Resistance:** The virus is easily killed by heat, ether, acetone, and standard disinfectants (bleach/sodium hypochlorite) but is resistant to UV light.

**B. Host Factors**
*   **Age:** Mostly affects the sexually active age group (20–49 years).
*   **High-Risk Groups:**
    *   **FSW:** Female Sex Workers.
    *   **MSM:** Men who have Sex with Men.
    *   **IDU:** Injecting Drug Users.
    *   **Bridge Population:** Truckers, migrant laborers.

**C. Modes of Transmission**
The efficiency of transmission varies by route:
1.  **Sexual Transmission:** Most common mode (approx. 87% in India). Transmission is more efficient from male to female.
2.  **Blood Contact:** Transfusion of infected blood/products is the most efficient route (>90-95% risk per exposure).
3.  **Sharing Needles:** Common among IDUs.
4.  **Maternal-Foetal (Vertical):** Transplacental, during delivery, or via breast milk.

**D. Incubation Period**
*   Ranges from a few months to 10 years or more. It is the time from infection to the development of overt AIDS.
*   **Window Period:** Time from infection until antibodies are detected (2–12 weeks). The person is highly infectious but tests negative on standard antibody tests.

### **2. The 4 Categories (WHO Clinical Staging)**

The World Health Organization classifies HIV disease into 4 clinical stages based on performance scale and symptoms.

| Stage | Clinical Condition | Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stage 1** | **Asymptomatic** | • Asymptomatic<br>• Persistent Generalized Lymphadenopathy (PGL) |
| **Stage 2** | **Mild Disease** | • Weight loss <10%<br>• Minor mucocutaneous manifestations (e.g., seborrheic dermatitis, fungal nail infections)<br>• Herpes zoster (last 5 years)<br>• Recurrent Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI) |
| **Stage 3** | **Moderate Disease** | • Weight loss >10%<br>• Unexplained chronic diarrhea (>1 month)<br>• Unexplained prolonged fever (>1 month)<br>• Oral Candidiasis (Thrush)<br>• Pulmonary [[Tuberculosis]]<br>• Severe bacterial infections (Pneumonia) |
| **Stage 4** | **Severe Disease (AIDS)** | • **HIV Wasting Syndrome** (Slim Disease)<br>• *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia (PCP)<br>• Toxoplasmosis of brain<br>• Kaposi Sarcoma<br>• Extrapulmonary Tuberculosis<br>• HIV Encephalopathy |

> **Clinical Relevance:** ART (Antiretroviral Therapy) is initiated regardless of the clinical stage or CD4 count under the current "Test and Treat" policy.

### **3. Diagnosis and Criteria**

**A. Screening and Confirmation**
*   **Screening Tests:** [[ELISA]] (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay), Rapid tests, Simple tests (E/R/S). ELISA is highly sensitive.
*   **Confirmatory Test:** [[Western Blot]] (highly specific).
*   **NACO Testing Strategies:**
    *   **Strategy I:** For blood safety (Transfusion). One test.
    *   **Strategy II:** For symptomatic patients/surveillance. Two tests.
    *   **Strategy III:** For asymptomatic individuals. Three tests.

**B. WHO Case Definition for AIDS Surveillance**
For an adult/adolescent to be diagnosed with AIDS for surveillance purposes, they must have **at least 2 Major signs + 1 Minor sign** (in the absence of other causes of immunosuppression).

**Mnemonic: W-D-F (Major Signs)**
*   **W**eight loss (>10% of body weight)
*   **D**iarrhea (Chronic, >1 month)
*   **F**ever (Prolonged, >1 month)

**Minor Signs:**
*   Cough for >1 month.
*   Generalized pruritic dermatitis.
*   History of Herpes Zoster.
*   Oropharyngeal candidiasis.
*   Chronic progressive Herpes Simplex infection.
*   Generalized lymphadenopathy.

> **Note:** Generalized Kaposi Sarcoma or Cryptococcal meningitis alone are sufficient for AIDS diagnosis.

### **4. Control of AIDS**

There is no cure; prevention is the only cure.

**A. Primary Prevention**
1.  **Health Education:** Promoting safe sex, use of condoms, and avoiding multiple partners. "ABC" approach (Abstinence, Be faithful, Condom use).
2.  **Blood Safety:** Mandatory screening of all donated blood for HIV 1 & 2. Encouraging voluntary blood donation.
3.  **Safety of Needles:** Use of disposable or auto-disable syringes. Harm reduction for IDUs (Needle syringe exchange programs).
4.  **Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission (PPTCT):** Life-long ART for all pregnant women living with HIV regardless of CD4 count.

**B. Secondary Prevention (Treatment)**
1.  **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART):** Inhibits viral replication and increases [[CD4 count]].
    *   **Current Preferred Regimen (Adults):** **TLD** (Tenofovir + Lamivudine + Dolutegravir).
2.  **Treatment of Opportunistic Infections:** Prophylaxis for PCP (Co-trimoxazole) and TB (Isoniazid).
3.  **Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP):** For needle stick injuries. Must be started within 72 hours (preferably within 2 hours). Regimen: Tenofovir + Lamivudine + Dolutegravir for 28 days.

### **5. National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) - Govt. of India**

**Nodal Agency:** [[NACO]] (National AIDS Control Organization) under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare.

**Key Objectives:**
1.  Reduce new infections (Zero new infections).
2.  Comprehensive care, support, and treatment for all Persons Living with HIV (PLHIV).
3.  Eliminate stigma and discrimination.

**Evolution of NACP:**
*   **NACP I (1992):** Focus on awareness and blood safety.
*   **NACP II (1999):** Focus on behavioral change and decentralized to State AIDS Control Societies (SACS).
*   **NACP III (2007):** Focus on Targeted Interventions (TI) for high-risk groups.
*   **NACP IV (2012-2017) & NSP (2017-2024):** Focus on "Accelerating Reversal" and integration.

**Key Strategies & Facilities:**
1.  **ICTC (Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres):** The entry point for detection. Offers pre-test and post-test counseling.
2.  **Targeted Interventions (TI):** Specific programs for High-Risk Groups (FSW, MSM, IDU, Truckers) providing condoms, needle exchange, and education.
3.  **Suraksha Clinics:** Designated STI/RTI clinics providing syndromic management.
4.  **ART Centres:** Provide free antiretroviral drugs.
5.  **95-95-95 Targets (by 2024):**
    *   **95%** of HIV+ people know their status.
    *   **95%** of those diagnosed are on ART.
    *   **95%** of those on ART have viral suppression.

**Current Status:** India has adopted the **"Test and Treat"** policy, meaning any person diagnosed HIV positive is started on ART immediately, regardless of CD4 count.
