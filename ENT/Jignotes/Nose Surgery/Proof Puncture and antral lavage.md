# [[Nose Surgery]] > Proof Puncture and antral lavage

### Proof Puncture and Antral Lavage

**Synonyms:** Antral Washout, Proof Puncture

**Definition**
Proof puncture is a surgical procedure involving the puncture of the medial wall of the [[maxillary sinus]] (antro-nasal wall) in the region of the [[inferior meatus]] followed by irrigation (lavage) of the sinus cavity,.

**Current Status**
With the advent of modern diagnostic tools like [[CT scan]] and the popularity of [[Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS)]], this procedure is now performed less frequently,. However, it remains a cost-effective and useful procedure in specific clinical scenarios.

### Indications

**Diagnostic**
*   **Confirm Diagnosis:** To confirm chronic or subacute [[maxillary sinusitis]].
*   **Sample Collection:** To obtain sinus contents for:
    *   Culture and sensitivity (to identify specific microorganisms),.
    *   Cytological examination (to exclude early malignancy),.

**Therapeutic**
*   **Pus Removal:** To wash out pus in cases of chronic or subacute [[maxillary sinusitis]] that do not respond to medical treatment,.
*   **Instillation of Drugs:** To introduce antibiotics or steroids directly into the sinus (less common now).

---

### Contraindications

1.  **[[Acute Maxillary Sinusitis]]:** There is a risk of spreading infection and causing [[osteomyelitis]] of the maxilla,.
2.  **Bleeding Diathesis:** Uncontrolled bleeding disorders.
3.  **Young Children:** Due to the risk of injury to tooth buds and the floor of the orbit (often requires general anesthesia).
4.  **Hypoplastic Maxilla:** Thick bony walls make puncture difficult and risky.

### Surgical Anatomy and Anesthesia

**Anesthesia**
*   **Adults:** Local Anesthesia. A pack soaked in 4% [[lignocaine]] with adrenaline is placed in the [[inferior meatus]] for 10–15 minutes to anesthetize the puncture site,.
*   **Children:** General Anesthesia is required.

**Position**
*   **Local Anesthesia:** Sitting position is preferred.
*   **General Anesthesia:** Tonsillectomy position (supine with head extended).

**Instruments**
*   [[Lichtwitz trocar and cannula]]: The primary instrument used to pierce the bone,,.
*   [[Higginson’s syringe]] or a 20–50 mL syringe: For irrigation,.
*   Nasal speculum (Thudichum).
*   Headlight or head mirror.

### Operative Technique

**1. Puncture Site Identification**
The puncture is made in the **lateral wall of the [[inferior meatus]]**. The ideal site is:
*   **1.5 – 2.0 cm posterior** to the anterior end of the [[inferior turbinate]],.
*   **High up** near the attachment of the concha (turbinate) to the lateral wall,.
    *   *Reason:* The bone is thinnest at this point (membranous part of the genu), making it easy to pierce, and it is safe from the [[nasolacrimal duct]],.

**2. Puncture**
*   The [[Lichtwitz trocar and cannula]] is introduced into the nose under the inferior turbinate.
*   **Direction:** The instrument is directed towards the **ipsilateral ear** (tragus),.
*   Firm pressure is applied until the nasoantral wall is pierced with a characteristic **"click" or "crack"**.
*   The trocar is withdrawn, leaving the cannula in place. The cannula is advanced slightly until it touches the posterior wall, then withdrawn slightly to ensure it is free in the cavity,.

**3. Lavage (Irrigation)**
*   The patient is asked to lean forward over a kidney tray with the **mouth open**. (This prevents swallowing of the fluid and allows breathing).
*   The sinus is irrigated with sterile normal saline at body temperature (37°C),.
*   Fluid enters the sinus through the cannula and exits through the natural ostium in the [[middle meatus]].
*   Irrigation continues until the returning fluid is clear.

**4. Completion**
*   The cannula is removed.
*   A small pack may be placed in the inferior meatus for 1 hour to control minor bleeding.

### Interpretation of Antral Contents (Diagnosis)

| Appearance of Washout Fluid | Probable Diagnosis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Thin, amber-colored fluid** (often clots on standing) containing cholesterol crystals | [[Antral cyst]], |
| **Blobs of mucopus** | [[Hyperplastic sinusitis]], |
| **Foul-smelling pus** (mixes easily with fluid) | Suppurative [[maxillary sinusitis]] (often dental origin) |
| **Frank Blood** | [[Hemoantrum]] (trauma) or Malignancy |
| **Negative Wash** (fluid does not return) | Blocked natural ostium or cannula tip in soft tissue |

### Complications

Although generally safe, improper technique can lead to complications.

**1. Local Complications**
*   **Cheek Swelling:** Occurs if the cannula is not deep enough and enters the soft tissues of the cheek anterior to the maxilla,.
*   **Orbital Injury:** If the trocar is directed too superiorly, it may pierce the roof of the antrum (floor of the orbit), leading to [[orbital cellulitis]] or injury to the globe,.
*   **Posterior Wall Puncture:** If the trocar is advanced too aggressively, it may pierce the posterior wall and enter the [[pterygopalatine fossa]], causing swelling in the posterior cheek or damage to the maxillary artery,.
*   **Nasolacrimal Duct Injury:** Occurs if the puncture is made too anteriorly.

**2. Systemic/General Complications**
*   **Hemorrhage:** Usually from the highly vascular nasal mucosa or lateral wall,.
*   **Vasovagal Attack:** Syncope due to pain or apprehension.
*   **[[Air Embolism]]:** A rare but potentially fatal complication. It occurs if **air is insufflated** into the antrum after lavage, entering injured mucosal veins,. *Clinical Implication: Never blow air into the sinus after washing.*

**3. Pain**
*   Pain in the upper teeth (due to dental nerve irritation) or headache.

*   **S**welling of cheek/Subcutaneous emphysema
*   **O**rbital injury
*   **A**ir embolism (Fatal!)
