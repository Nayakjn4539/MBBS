# [[DISASTER MANAGEMENT]] > What is disaster Management in Relation to recent cyclone Amphan

### **Definition of Disaster**

A **[[Disaster]]** is defined as "A serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society involving widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses and impacts, which exceed the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources." (defined by WHO and UNISDR).

**Alternative Definition (Colin Grant):**
A catastrophe causing injury or illness simultaneously to at least **30 people** who will require hospital emergency treatment.

### **Management in Relation to Cyclone Amphan**

Cyclone Amphan falls under the category of **[[Natural Disaster]]** (Meteorological). The management follows the **Disaster Management Cycle** involving Preparedness, Response, and Recovery.

#### **1. Disaster Preparedness (Pre-Disaster Phase)**
This is a long-term development activity to strengthen the capacity to handle the emergency.
*   **Early Warning System:** Utilizing data from the [[Indian Meteorological Department]] (IMD) for detection and tracing of cyclone storms.
*   **Evacuation:** Moving people from low-lying coastal areas to safe cyclone shelters or higher ground.
*   **Protection of Resources:**
    *   Ensuring safety of medical supplies, dry food, and water.
    *   Securing loose tiles, doors, and windows of health centers and houses.
*   **Immunization Planning:** Protecting the "Cold Chain" for vaccines during power outages.

#### **2. Disaster Response (During & Immediate Post-Disaster)**
The greatest need for emergency care occurs in the first few hours.
*   **Search and Rescue:** Organized relief services and immediate help from uninjured survivors.
*   **[[Triage]]:** Rapid classification of the injured at the site to assign priorities for treatment.
    *   **Red (High Priority):** Immediate resuscitation/surgery needed (<6 hours).
    *   **Yellow (Medium Priority):** Possible resuscitation needed (<24 hours).
    *   **Green (Low Priority):** Ambulatory/Minor illness.
    *   **Black (Least Priority):** Dead or moribund.
*   **First Aid & Stabilization:** Basic life support (ABC - Airway, Breathing, Circulation) before transport.

#### **3. Health and Medical Relief (Public Health Intervention)**
Post-cyclone Amphan, the focus shifts to preventing the "Second Disaster" (epidemics).

*   **Water and Sanitation (Crucial Step):**
    *   **Chlorination:** This is the foremost step. The level of [[residual chlorine]] should be maintained at **> 0.7 mg/L**.
    *   Provision of safe drinking water to prevent [[Cholera]] and Gastroenteritis.
*   **Disease Surveillance:**
    *   **Gastroenteritis:** The most commonly reported disease in the post-disaster phase.
    *   **Vector-borne diseases:** Risk of Malaria and Dengue increases due to water stagnation (breeding sites).
    *   **Leptospirosis:** High risk in floodwaters/cyclones (e.g., Orissa super cyclone precedent).
*   **Vaccination:**
    *   Routine Typhoid/Cholera vaccines are **not** recommended.
    *   **Measles** vaccination is the highest priority for children in camps/shelters.
*   **Nutrition:**
    *   Distribution of Vitamin A to prevent deficiency, which is common post-disaster due to deficient diets and diarrhea.

#### **4. Rehabilitation and Mitigation**
*   **Restoration:** Repairing water supply systems, sewerage, and power lines.
*   **Vector Control:** Intensified control for mosquitoes (Malaria/Dengue) and rodents (Leptospirosis).
*   **Mitigation:** Enforcing better building codes and land-use planning to reduce future vulnerability.

### **Clinical Relevance**
During a cyclone like Amphan, the "Golden Hour" concept in trauma is vital. However, in mass casualty incidents, the principle of **"First come, first treated" is NOT followed.** Instead, resources are allocated to those with the highest likelihood of survival (Triage) to do the greatest good for the greatest number.

### **Mnemonic: "PREPARE" for Disaster Management**
*   **P** - **P**lanning and Warning (IMD alerts)
*   **R** - **R**escue and Evacuation
*   **E** - **E**mergency Care (Triage - Red/Yellow/Green/Black)
*   **P** - **P**rotection against Epidemics (Chlorination >0.7mg/L)
*   **A** - **A**ssessment of Damage (Rapid health assessment)
*   **R** - **R**ehabilitation (Restoring services)
*   **E** - **E**ducation (Community awareness)
