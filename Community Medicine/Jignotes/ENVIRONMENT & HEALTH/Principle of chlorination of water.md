# Principle of Chlorination of Water

Chlorination is the most widely used method for water disinfection. It serves as a supplement, not a substitute, to sand filtration. Its principle relies on the chemical properties of chlorine to destroy pathogenic organisms and oxidize organic matter.

### Mechanism of Action
When chlorine is added to water, it hydrolyzes to form **Hydrochloric acid** and [[Hypochlorous acid]] (HOCl).
$$H_2O + Cl_2 \rightleftharpoons HCl + HOCl$$

The Hypochlorous acid further ionizes to form Hydrogen ions and [[Hypochlorite ions]] (OCl⁻).
$$HOCl \rightleftharpoons H^+ + OCl^-$$

*   **Disinfecting Agent:** The disinfecting action is primarily due to **[[Hypochlorous acid]] (HOCl)** and to a small extent by Hypochlorite ions.
*   **Effectiveness:** HOCl is **70–80 times** more effective than OCl⁻.
*   **Role of pH:** Chlorine acts best as a disinfectant when the pH of water is around **7.0** because of the predominance of HOCl. If pH exceeds 8.5, it becomes unreliable as most HOCl ionizes to OCl⁻.

### Rules of Chlorination
For effective chlorination, the following criteria must be met:

1.  **Water Clarity:** The water to be chlorinated should be clear and free from [[turbidity]]. Turbidity impedes efficient chlorination as particles can shield bacteria from the disinfectant.
2.  **[[Chlorine Demand]]:** This is the difference between the amount of chlorine added and the amount of residual chlorine remaining at the end of a specific contact period.
    *   *Definition:* It is the amount of chlorine needed to destroy bacteria and oxidize all organic matter and ammoniacal substances present in the water.
3.  **Contact Period:** A minimum contact period of **[[1 hour]]** is essential to effectively kill bacteria and viruses.
4.  **Residual Chlorine:** There must be a presence of [[free residual chlorine]] of at least **0.5 mg/L** (0.5 ppm) after the contact period.
    *   *Purpose:* This provides a margin of safety against subsequent microbial contamination during storage and distribution.

### Break Point Chlorination
This is the accepted method for disinfecting large water supplies. It operates on the principle of satisfying the chlorine demand of water before free chlorine appears.

**Stages of Chlorination:**
1.  **Formation of Chloramines:** Chlorine reacts with ammonia to form chloramines (combined residual).
2.  **Destruction:** Continued addition of chlorine destroys chloramines and oxidizes organic matter.
3.  **[[Break Point]]:** The point where the chlorine demand of the water is fully met (ammonia and organics are destroyed).
4.  **Free Residual:** Addition of chlorine *beyond* the break point results in the accumulation of **Free Residual Chlorine** (HOCl and OCl⁻), which is the most effective disinfectant form.

### Dosage Calculation
The correct dose of chlorine to be applied is calculated as:
**Correct Dose = Chlorine Demand + Free Residual Chlorine (0.5 mg/L)**

| Parameter | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Minimum Free Residual Chlorine** | **0.5 mg/L** (0.5 ppm) |
| **Contact Period** | **1 Hour** |
| **pH** | **~ 7.0** |
| **Estimation Apparatus** | [[Horrock's Apparatus]] |
| **Testing Reagent** | **Orthotolidine (OT) Test** |

### Clinical & Public Health Relevance
*   **Protection:** Chlorination kills pathogenic bacteria but has **no effect** on spores, protozoal cysts, and certain viruses (e.g., Polio, Hepatitis A) at normal doses.
*   **Safety Margin:** The concept of *residual chlorine* is unique to chlorination (unlike Ozone or UV). It ensures that water remains safe even if minor contamination occurs in the distribution pipes (e.g., due to leaky joints or cross-connections).
*   **Superchlorination:** In cases of heavy pollution (e.g., cyclones, floods), **[[Superchlorination]]** is used followed by dechlorination to ensure safety against resistant organisms like cysts.

### Mnemonics
**"C-D-C-R"** (Think of the CDC Regulations)
*   **C** - **C**lear water (No turbidity)
*   **D** - **D**emand must be met (Chlorine demand)
*   **C** - **C**ontact period (1 hour)
*   **R** - **R**esidual chlorine (0.5 mg/L)
