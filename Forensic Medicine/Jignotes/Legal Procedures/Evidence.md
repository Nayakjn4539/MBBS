# EVIDENCE

**Definition**
Evidence implies and includes all legal means, exclusive of mere argument, which help to prove or disprove any matter of fact, the truth of which is submitted to judicial investigation.

### Classification of Evidence

1.  **Direct Evidence:**
    *   Evidence of a fact actually in issue (e.g., testimony of an eyewitness who saw the crime).
    *   It is the testimony of a witness to the existence or non-existence of a fact or fact in issue.
    *   **Medical Example:** A doctor testifying to the injuries seen on a patient.

2.  **Indirect or Circumstantial Evidence:**
    *   Evidence of a fact not actually in issue, but legally relevant to the fact in issue.
    *   The existence of the principal fact is inferred from the circumstances.
    *   **Medical Example:** DNA found at a crime scene matching the accused, or a compatible blood group stain on the accused's clothes.

3.  **Hearsay Evidence:**
    *   Statement made by a person other than the witness giving evidence.
    *   **General Rule:** Usually **inadmissible** in court because the original speaker cannot be cross-examined.
    *   **Exceptions:**
        *   [[Dying Declaration]]
        *   Opinions of experts expressed in treatises (books).
        *   Medical certificates/reports (if the doctor is dead or cannot be found).

### Medical Evidence
Medical evidence is the assistance provided by a medical professional to the court to facilitate the administration of justice. It is of two main types:

#### 1. Oral Evidence (Parole)
*   Statements made by a doctor/witness in the court under oath.
*   The doctor must attend the court when summoned (via [[Subpoena]]) and give oral testimony regarding their observations or expert opinion.
*   **Admissibility:** Oral evidence is generally considered **superior** to documentary evidence because the witness can be cross-examined to test the veracity of the statement.

#### 2. Documentary Evidence
This includes all documents produced for the inspection of the Court.
*   **Medical Certificates:**
    *   Issued regarding ill-health, insanity, age, death, etc.
    *   Must be issued by a registered medical practitioner.
    *   **Legal Warning:** Issuing a false certificate is a crime under **Section 197 IPC**.
*   **Medico-legal Reports (MLR):**
    *   Prepared on request of investigating authority (Police/Magistrate).
    *   Examples: Wound certificate, [[Postmortem Report]], Sexual assault examination report.
    *   It consists of two parts: **Facts** observed and **Opinion** drawn from facts.
    *   It is **not** substantive evidence; the doctor must testify in court to prove the contents (unless legally exempted).
*   **Dying Declaration:** (See details below).

### [[Dying Declaration]]
A written or oral statement made by a person who is dying (or dead by the time of trial) regarding the **cause of their death** or the **circumstances** resulting in their death.

*   **Legal Basis:** Admissible under **Section 32 (1)** of the [[Indian Evidence Act]] (IEA).
*   **Principle:** *Nemo moriturus praesumitur mentiri* (A man will not meet his maker with a lie in his mouth).
*   **Authority to Record:**
    1.  **Magistrate:** (Ideal/Best value).
    2.  **Doctor:** If the patient's condition is deteriorating and there is no time to call a magistrate.
    3.  **Police Officer/Village Headman:** If no one else is available (Least evidentiary value).

**Rules for Recording Dying Declaration:**
1.  **Compos Mentis:** The doctor must certify that the patient was conscious and mentally fit ([[Compos Mentis]]) to give the statement *before* and *after* recording.
2.  **Oath:** No oath is administered to the dying person.
3.  **Presence:** The accused or their lawyer is **not** present. No cross-examination is done.
4.  **Language:** Must be recorded in the **victim's own words** (verbatim).
5.  **No Leading Questions:** The recorder should not suggest answers.
6.  **Read Over:** The statement should be read back to the patient and their signature/thumb impression obtained.
7.  **Survival:** If the person survives, the dying declaration is **not** admissible under Section 32 IEA. It can be used only for corroboration or contradiction under Section 157 or 145 IEA.

> **Mnemonic for Dying Declaration Rules: "NO CROSS"**
> *   **N** - No Oath.
> *   **O** - Own words (Verbatim).
> *   **C** - [[Compos Mentis]] (Mental fitness certified by Dr).
> *   **R** - Read over to patient.
> *   **O** - Only cause/circumstances of death.
> *   **S** - Section 32 IEA.
> *   **S** - Superiority (Magistrate > Doctor > Police).

### [[Dying Deposition]]
A statement made by a dying person on oath, recorded by a Magistrate in the presence of the accused or their lawyer.

**Difference between Dying Declaration and Dying Deposition**

| Feature | Dying Declaration | Dying Deposition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Recorded By** | Magistrate, Doctor, Police, or any person | Only by a Magistrate (First Class) |
| **Oath** | Not administered | **Administered** |
| **Accused Presence** | Not present | **Present** (allowed to cross-examine) |
| **Cross-Examination** | Not possible | **Permitted** then and there |
| **Legal Value** | Hearsay evidence (Exception to hearsay rule) | Very high (Direct evidence) |
| **If Patient Survives** | Becomes invalid as DD (used only for corroboration) | **Remains valid** as evidence |
| **Practice in India** | Very Common | Rare/Obsolete (followed in USA/UK) |

### Witnesses
A person who gives evidence in a court of law.

**1. Common/Lay Witness:**
*   Testifies based on **facts** observed by their own senses (saw, heard, perceived).
*   **Principle:** First-hand knowledge rule.
*   Example: A bystander who saw an accident.

**2. [[Expert Witness]]:**
*   A person trained/skilled in a technical/scientific subject (e.g., Doctor, Ballistics expert, Fingerprint expert).
*   Can give an **opinion** based on facts observed by themselves or others.
*   Under **Section 45 IEA**.
*   **Note:** A doctor can be both a common witness (describing factual injuries) and an expert witness (opining on the cause of death).

**3. Hostile Witness:**
*   A witness who wilfully gives false evidence or suppresses the truth to damage the case of the party who called them.
*   Permission from the court is required to declare a witness "hostile".
*   Once declared hostile, the lawyer who called them can cross-examine them.

### Chain of Custody (Continuity of Possession)
It is the documentation trail that records the sequence of custody, control, transfer, analysis, and disposition of physical or electronic evidence.

*   **Importance:** Ensures that the evidence presented in court is the *same* item collected at the scene and has not been altered, substituted, or contaminated.
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Sample collected and sealed by the doctor.
    2.  Label attached with patient details, date, time, and doctor's signature.
    3.  Handed over to the police constable (obtain receipt).
    4.  Police hand it to the [[Forensic Science Laboratory]] (FSL).
    5.  Every person handling the sample must sign the chain of custody form.
*   **Break in Chain:** If the chain is broken, the evidence may be rendered inadmissible in court.
