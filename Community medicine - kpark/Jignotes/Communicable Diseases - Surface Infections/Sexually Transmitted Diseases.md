# [[Communicable Diseases - Surface Infections]] > Sexually Transmitted Diseases

# 1. Syphilis (ICD-A53.9)

Syphilis is a chronic, systemic infection with a waxing and waning course, capable of affecting almost any organ in the body. It is often called the "Great Imitator."

### **Epidemiological Determinants**
*   **Agent Factor:** Caused by **[[Treponema pallidum]]**, a delicate spirochete. It dies rapidly outside the body (killed by drying and heat).
*   **Reservoir of Infection:** Humans are the only known reservoir.
    *   **Source:** Patients with primary sores (chancre) or secondary lesions (condylomata lata, mucous patches). Tertiary lesions are generally non-infectious.
*   **Modes of Transmission:**
    1.  **Sexual Contact:** Most common (Direct contact with infectious lesions).
    2.  **Transplacental:** From infected mother to fetus ([[Congenital Syphilis]]). Occurs after 4th month of gestation when Langhans’ layer atrophies.
    3.  **Accidental:** Blood transfusion (rare as organism dies in cold storage >4 days), needle stick injuries.
*   **Incubation Period:** **10 to 90 days** (Average: **3 weeks** or 21 days).
*   **Susceptibility:** Universal. No natural immunity. Reinfection can occur after treatment.

### **Clinical Picture (Acquired Syphilis)**
The disease manifests in three distinct stages:

1.  **Primary Syphilis:**
    *   **Hard Chancre:** A single, painless, indurated (hard button-like base), clean-based ulcer at the site of inoculation (genitals). Heals spontaneously in 4–6 weeks.
    *   **Lymphadenopathy:** Painless, discrete, firm, non-tender inguinal lymph nodes (Bubo).

2.  **Secondary Syphilis (The "Disseminated" Stage):**
    *   Occurs 6–8 weeks after the chancre. Highly infectious stage.
    *   **Skin:** Maculopapular rash (involving palms and soles), **Condylomata lata** (moist, warty lesions in genital folds).
    *   **Mucosa:** Snail-track ulcers/mucous patches in the mouth/throat.
    *   **Systemic:** Generalized lymphadenopathy, fever, sore throat.

3.  **Latent Syphilis:** Asymptomatic phase; diagnosis only by serology.
    *   *Early Latent:* < 2 years duration (infectious).
    *   *Late Latent:* > 2 years duration (non-infectious except to fetus).

4.  **Tertiary Syphilis:**
    *   Occurs years later (non-infectious).
    *   **Lesions:** **[[Gumma]]** (destructive granulomatous lesions in skin/bones).
    *   **Cardiovascular:** Aortitis, aneurysm.
    *   **Neurosyphilis:** Tabes dorsalis, General Paresis of Insane (GPI).

### **Congenital Syphilis**
Transmitted from mother to child.
*   **Hutchinson's Triad:** Interstitial keratitis + Sensorineural deafness + Hutchinson's teeth (peg-shaped incisors).
*   **Other signs:** Saddle nose, Sabre tibia (anterior bowing), Mulberry molars.

### **Diagnosis**
*   **Dark Field Microscopy:** Specific for Primary Syphilis (demonstrates motility of spirochetes from chancre fluid).
*   **Serology:**
    1.  **Non-Treponemal Tests (Screening):** **VDRL** (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) and **RPR** (Rapid Plasma Reagin). Sensitive but not specific (Biological false positives occur in malaria, pregnancy, leprosy). Useful for monitoring treatment response.
    2.  **Treponemal Tests (Confirmatory):** **TPHA**, **FTA-ABS**. Highly specific. Remain positive for life even after cure.

### **Treatment**
*   **Drug of Choice:** **[[Benzathine Penicillin G]]**.
    *   **Early Syphilis (Primary/Secondary/Early Latent):** 2.4 Million Units IM (single dose).
    *   **Late Syphilis (>2 years duration):** 2.4 Million Units IM weekly for 3 weeks (Total 7.2 Million Units).
    *   **Penicillin Allergy:** Doxycycline or Erythromycin (for 14–30 days depending on stage). Tetracyclines are contraindicated in pregnancy.

# 2. Gonorrhea (ICD-A54.9)

An acute bacterial infection of the mucous membrane of the genitourinary tract, often presenting as purulent discharge.

### **Epidemiological Determinants**
*   **Agent Factor:** **[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]** (Gonococcus). It is a Gram-negative, kidney-shaped, intracellular diplococcus.
*   **Reservoir:** Man is the only reservoir.
    *   **Carriers:** Women are often asymptomatic carriers ("Reservoir of infection") leading to silent transmission.
*   **Modes of Transmission:**
    1.  **Sexual Intercourse:** Main route.
    2.  **Vertical:** During childbirth causing neonatal conjunctivitis.
    3.  **Fomites:** Rare (e.g., infected towels causing vulvovaginitis in children).
*   **Incubation Period:** **2 to 7 days** (Usually 3–4 days). Shorter than syphilis.

### **Clinical Picture**
*   **In Males:**
    *   **Urethritis:** Acute burning micturition (dysuria).
    *   **Discharge:** Thick, creamy, purulent yellow discharge ("The Drip").
    *   **Complications:** Epididymitis, Urethral stricture (late).
*   **In Females:**
    *   **Cervicitis:** Often mild or asymptomatic. Mucopurulent discharge.
    *   **Complications:** **[[Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)]]** leading to infertility and ectopic pregnancy. Bartholinitis.
*   **Disseminated Gonococcal Infection:** Arthritis, dermatitis, endocarditis.
*   **In Newborns:** **[[Ophthalmia Neonatorum]]** (purulent conjunctivitis within 1-5 days of birth). Can cause blindness.

### **Diagnosis**
*   **Gram Stain:** Gram-negative intracellular diplococci inside polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). Highly diagnostic in males.
*   **Culture:** **Thayer-Martin medium** (Selective media). Gold standard for females.

### **Treatment**
*   **Uncomplicated Gonorrhea:**
    *   **Ceftriaxone** (IM single dose) OR **Cefixime** (Oral single dose).
*   **Co-infection Strategy:** Always treat for *Chlamydia trachomatis* co-infection using **Azithromycin** (1g oral single dose) or Doxycycline.
*   **PPNG Strains:** Penicillinase-Producing *N. gonorrhoeae* are resistant to penicillin; hence cephalosporins are preferred.

# Control of STDs: The Syndromic Approach

Since etiological diagnosis (lab tests) is expensive and time-consuming, the **[[National AIDS Control Programme (NACP)]]** promotes Syndromic Management. Treatment is given based on clinical syndromes (groups of symptoms) using color-coded kits provided at **Suraksha Clinics**.

| Kit Color | Syndrome Covered | Treatment Drugs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Grey (Kit 1)** | Urethral/Anorectal Discharge / Cervicitis | Azithromycin + Cefixime (covers Gonorrhea + Chlamydia) |
| **Green (Kit 2)** | Vaginitis | Secnidazole + Fluconazole (covers Trichomonas + Bacterial Vaginosis + Candida) |
| **White (Kit 3)** | Genital Ulcer (Non-Herpetic) | Benzathine Penicillin + Azithromycin (covers Syphilis + Chancroid) |
| **Blue (Kit 4)** | Genital Ulcer (Non-Herpetic - Allergic to Penicillin) | Doxycycline + Azithromycin |
| **Red (Kit 5)** | Genital Ulcer (Herpetic) | Acyclovir |
| **Yellow (Kit 6)** | Lower Abdominal Pain (PID) | Cefixime + Metronidazole + Doxycycline |
| **Black (Kit 7)** | Inguinal Bubo | Azithromycin + Doxycycline (covers LGV + Chancroid) |

### **Prevention Strategy**
1.  **Contact Tracing:** Identify and treat sexual partners.
2.  **Cluster Testing:** Screening persons in the same socio-sexual environment.
3.  **Barrier Methods:** Promotion of **[[Condoms]]**.
4.  **Health Education:** ABC Strategy (**A**bstinence, **B**e Faithful, **C**ondom use).

**Mnemonic for Incubation Periods:**
*   **G**onorrhea = **G**o fast (**2-7 days**)
*   **S**yphilis = **S**low (**3 weeks**)

**Clinical Relevance:**
The risk of HIV transmission increases 8-10 times in the presence of ulcerative STDs like Syphilis. Therefore, STD control is a major strategy for HIV control.
