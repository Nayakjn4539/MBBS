| Disease Name+definition | Etiology | Risk factors | Pathogenesis and stages | Genes and mutations involved | Gross Morphology | Microscopic features+special stains+identification | Clinical Manifestations | Diagnostic markers | Classification of types if any | Complications or associated disorders | Treatment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Hyperpituitarism** A condition arising from excess secretion of trophic hormones from the anterior pituitary. | The most common cause is an adenoma arising in the anterior lobe of the pituitary. Other causes include pituitary hyperplasias, carcinomas, secretion of hormones by nonpituitary tumors, and certain hypothalamic disorders. | - | Caused by mutations in cancer genes, most commonly acquired somatic mutations, which lead to autonomous and excessive hormone production. Tumors can be microadenomas (<1cm) or macroadenomas (>1cm). Macroadenomas are more likely to be nonfunctional or invasive. | * **GNAS**: Activating mutations in the gene encoding the Gs alpha subunit. Abrogates GTPase activity, leading to constitutive cAMP generation and unchecked proliferation. Found in ~40% of somatotroph adenomas. * **USP8**: Activating mutations enhance the activity of EGFR and other pro-growth pathways. Found in 30-60% of corticotroph adenomas. * Germline loss-of-function mutations (~5% of cases): **MEN1, CDKN1B, PRKAR1A, AIP**. | Soft, well-circumscribed lesions. May be confined to the sella turcica or expand to erode the sella and compress the optic chiasm. Larger lesions (macroadenomas) may have foci of hemorrhage and necrosis. Aggressive adenomas may infiltrate cavernous/sphenoid sinuses, dura, or brain. | Composed of uniform, polygonal cells in sheets or cords. Cellular monomorphism and absence of a significant reticulin network distinguish adenomas from normal pituitary parenchyma. Immunohistochemical stains for hormones and lineage-specific transcription factors (e.g., **PIT-1, TPIT, SF-1**) are used for subtyping. | Manifestations depend on the hormone being overproduced (e.g., galactorrhea/amenorrhea in prolactinomas, gigantism/acromegaly in somatotroph adenomas, Cushing disease in corticotroph adenomas). **Local mass effects** include visual field defects (**bitemporal hemianopsia**), elevated intracranial pressure (headache, nausea, vomiting), and cranial nerve palsies. | Elevated levels of specific pituitary hormones (e.g., prolactin, GH, ACTH) and their downstream targets (e.g., IGF-1, cortisol). Imaging (MRI) shows pituitary mass. | Classified by hormone produced:  * Lactotroph adenoma (prolactin) * Somatotroph adenoma (GH) * Corticotroph adenoma (ACTH) * Thyrotroph adenoma (TSH) * Gonadotroph adenoma (LH, FSH) * Null cell adenoma * Plurihormonal adenoma | **Pituitary apoplexy** (acute hemorrhage into an adenoma), visual loss, cranial nerve palsies, hypopituitarism (from compression of normal gland), Nelson syndrome. | Surgery. Pharmacologic therapy (e.g., dopamine agonists for lactotroph adenomas, somatostatin analogues for somatotroph adenomas). |
| **Hypopituitarism** Decreased secretion of pituitary hormones, resulting from diseases of the hypothalamus or pituitary. Occurs when approx. 75% of the parenchyma is lost. | Most cases arise from destructive processes in the anterior pituitary:  * Tumors and mass lesions (nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas). * Traumatic brain injury and subarachnoid hemorrhage. * Pituitary surgery or radiation. * **Sheehan syndrome** (postpartum ischemic necrosis). * **Pituitary apoplexy** (sudden hemorrhage). * Inflammatory disorders (sarcoidosis), infections. * Genetic defects (e.g., **PIT1** mutation). | Obesity and multiple pregnancies (for primary empty sella syndrome). Obstetric hemorrhage or shock (for Sheehan syndrome). | Progressive loss of pituitary parenchyma due to various insults. **Sheehan Syndrome**: during pregnancy, the pituitary enlarges without a proportional increase in blood supply, making it vulnerable to ischemia from systemic hypotension (e.g., postpartum hemorrhage). **Empty Sella Syndrome**: herniation of arachnoid mater and CSF into the sella compresses the pituitary. | Rare congenital deficiency of transcription factors. For example, mutation of the pituitary-specific gene **PIT1** results in combined pituitary hormone deficiency (GH, prolactin, and TSH). | In Sheehan syndrome, the gland is small and scarred. In empty sella syndrome, the sella is enlarged but filled with CSF, with the pituitary compressed into a thin layer. | In Sheehan syndrome, ischemic area is resorbed and replaced by a nubbin of fibrous tissue. | Varies depending on specific hormones lacking.  * GH deficiency: pituitary dwarfism in children. * Gonadotropin (LH/FSH) deficiency: amenorrhea, infertility, decreased libido, loss of pubic/axillary hair. * TSH deficiency: hypothyroidism. * ACTH deficiency: hypoadrenalism. * Prolactin deficiency: failure of postpartum lactation. * Pallor due to loss of MSH stimulatory effects. | Low serum levels of pituitary hormones and the hormones from their target organs (e.g., low TSH and T4; low ACTH and cortisol). Stimulation tests can help differentiate pituitary vs. hypothalamic causes. | - | Diabetes Insipidus (if posterior pituitary or hypothalamus is involved). Growth failure, infertility, hypoadrenalism. | Hormone replacement therapy. |
| **Hyperthyroidism (Thyrotoxicosis)** A hypermetabolic state caused by elevated circulating levels of free T3 and T4. Hyperthyroidism is the most common cause of thyrotoxicosis. | Most commonly caused by hyperfunction of the thyroid gland.  * Diffuse toxic hyperplasia (Graves disease) - 85% of cases. * Hyperfunctioning ("toxic") multinodular goiter. * Hyperfunctioning ("toxic") thyroid adenoma. * Rarely, TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma. | Female sex, age 20-40 (for Graves). Iodine deficiency (for toxic multinodular goiter). | Pathogenesis depends on the underlying cause. In general, excess T3/T4 leads to an increase in basal metabolic rate and overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system (increased beta-adrenergic tone). This causes increased carbohydrate/lipid catabolism and protein synthesis. | Depends on cause.  * **Graves disease**: Associated with polymorphisms in **CTLA4, PTPN22, IL2RA**, and **TSHR**. * **Toxic adenoma/goiter**: Somatic gain-of-function mutations in the **TSHR** gene or, less commonly, the **GNAS** gene. | See specific diseases (Graves, multinodular goiter, adenoma). | See specific diseases. Myocardial changes can include focal lymphocytic infiltrates, mild fibrosis, and myofibril fatty change. | Symptoms of hypermetabolic state: weight loss despite increased appetite, heat intolerance, excessive sweating. Skin is warm and flushed. Cardiac: tachycardia, palpitations, cardiomegaly, arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation). Neuromuscular: tremor, hyperactivity, emotional lability, anxiety, insomnia, proximal muscle weakness (**thyroid myopathy**). GI: hypermotility. Skeletal: osteoporosis. Ocular: wide, staring gaze and lid lag. **Thyroid storm**: abrupt onset of severe symptoms, fever, tachycardia. | Low serum TSH (in primary hyperthyroidism). Elevated free T4 and/or T3. Radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) scan helps determine etiology (diffuse uptake in Graves, focal in adenoma, decreased in thyroiditis). | * **Primary**: Intrinsic thyroid abnormality (Graves, toxic goiter/adenoma). * **Secondary**: Extrathyroidal process (TSH-secreting pituitary tumor). | Congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, osteoporosis and increased fracture risk, **thyroid storm**. | β-blockers (for symptoms). Thionamides (methimazole, propylthiouracil) to block hormone synthesis. Radioactive iodine ablation. Surgery (thyroidectomy). |
| **Hypothyroidism** A condition caused by a structural or functional derangement that interferes with the production of thyroid hormone. | * **Primary Hypothyroidism (thyroid failure)**: Postablative (surgery, radiation), autoimmune (Hashimoto thyroiditis), iodine deficiency, drugs (lithium), congenital defects. Autoimmune disease is the most common cause in iodine-sufficient areas. * **Secondary Hypothyroidism (pituitary/hypothalamic failure)**: Deficiency of TSH or TRH. | Female sex, increasing age. Family history of autoimmune disease. Iodine deficiency. History of neck radiation or thyroid surgery. | A defect anywhere in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis leads to inadequate thyroid hormone production. This results in a generalized slowing of metabolic processes. In primary hypothyroidism, the low T3/T4 levels lead to a compensatory increase in TSH, which can cause thyroid enlargement (goiter). | * **Congenital (rare)**: Germline mutations in genes for thyroid development (**PAX8, FOXE1**) or TSH receptor. * **Dyshormonogenetic goiter (rare)**: Inborn errors of thyroid metabolism. * **Hashimoto**: Polymorphisms in **CTLA4, PTPN22, IL2RA**. | In goitrous hypothyroidism, gland is enlarged (see goiter, Hashimoto's). In postablative cases, the gland may be absent or small and fibrotic. | **Myxedema**: accumulation of matrix substances (glycosaminoglycans, hyaluronic acid) in skin, subcutaneous tissue, and visceral sites, leading to nonpitting edema. | Manifestations depend on age of onset. See **Cretinism** (infancy) and **Myxedema** (adult). Generally: fatigue, apathy, mental sluggishness, cold intolerance, weight gain, constipation, decreased sweating. Skin is cool and pale. Reduced cardiac output causes shortness of breath. Voice deepens. | **Measurement of serum TSH is the most sensitive screening test**. In primary hypothyroidism, TSH is increased and free T4 is decreased. In secondary hypothyroidism, both TSH and T4 are decreased. May have hypercholesterolemia. | * **Primary**: Intrinsic thyroid abnormality. * **Secondary (Central)**: Pituitary or hypothalamic disease.  Can also be classified as congenital, autoimmune, or iatrogenic. | Increased cardiovascular mortality due to hypercholesterolemia and accelerated atherosclerosis. Heart failure. Myxedema coma. | Hormone replacement therapy (e.g., levothyroxine). |
| **Cretinism** Hypothyroidism that develops in infancy or early childhood. | Historically common in areas of endemic dietary iodine deficiency. Rare causes include inborn errors of thyroid hormone biosynthesis (**dyshormonogenetic goiter**). | Maternal iodine deficiency. Living in endemic regions (Himalayas, inland China, Africa). | Thyroid hormone is critical for fetal and neonatal brain development. Maternal T3 and T4 cross the placenta. If maternal thyroid deficiency occurs before the fetal thyroid is functional, mental impairment is severe. If it occurs later, after the fetal thyroid is functional, brain development is less affected. | Rare genetic defects interfering with thyroid hormone biosynthesis. | - | - | Severe intellectual disability, short stature, coarse facial features, a protruding tongue, and an umbilical hernia. | Low T4, elevated TSH. Screening of newborns is critical. | - | Permanent, severe intellectual disability if not treated promptly. | Thyroid hormone replacement. Iodine supplementation in diet prevents endemic cretinism. |
| **Myxedema** Hypothyroidism developing in the older child or adult. The term refers to the associated skin and tissue changes. | Same as for general hypothyroidism (autoimmune disease, postablative, drugs, etc.). | Same as for general hypothyroidism. | Slowing of physical and mental activity due to lack of thyroid hormone. Diminished expression of genes for sarcolemmal proteins (e.g., calcium ATPases, beta-adrenergic receptor) leads to decreased cardiac output. Altered lipid metabolism leads to increased cholesterol. Deposition of matrix substances in tissues causes edema. | - | - | Accumulation of matrix substances, such as **glycosaminoglycans** and **hyaluronic acid**, in the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and visceral sites. This results in nonpitting edema. | Generalized fatigue, apathy, mental sluggishness (mimicking depression). Listless, cold intolerant, frequently overweight. Speech is slowed. Skin is cool and pale. Nonpitting edema leads to broadening and coarsening of facial features, enlargement of the tongue, and deepening of the voice. Reduced cardiac output leads to shortness of breath and decreased exercise capacity. | Increased TSH, decreased T4. Increased total and LDL cholesterol. | - | **Myxedema coma** (severe hypothyroidism leading to hypothermia, cardiovascular collapse, coma). Increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular mortality. | Thyroid hormone replacement. |
| **Hashimoto Thyroiditis (Struma lymphomatosa)** An autoimmune disease that is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas, resulting in progressive destruction of the thyroid gland. | Autoimmune disease caused by a breakdown in self-tolerance to thyroid autoantigens. | Most prevalent between 45 and 65 years. Female predominance of 10:1 to 20:1. Strong genetic component. Coexistence with other autoimmune diseases. | Failure of self-tolerance in T-cells. Immunologic mechanisms of thyrocyte destruction include:  1. **CD8+ cytotoxic T cell-mediated cell death**: Direct killing of thyroid follicular cells. 2. **Cytokine-mediated cell death**: CD4+ Th1 cells produce IFN-γ, which activates macrophages and damages follicles. 3. **Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)**: Antithyroid antibodies bind to follicular cells, marking them for destruction by NK cells.  Progressive loss of thyroid epithelial cells is replaced by mononuclear infiltrate and fibrosis. | Associated with polymorphisms in genes regulating T-cell responses:  * **CTLA4** (Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4) * **PTPN22** (Protein tyrosine phosphatase-22) * **IL2RA** (Interleukin-2 receptor α chain) | Thyroid is usually diffusely and symmetrically enlarged, but can be localized. Gland is well-demarcated with an intact capsule. Cut surface is pale, yellow-tan, firm, and nodular. | Extensive parenchymal infiltration by a mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate, including small lymphocytes, plasma cells, and well-developed **germinal centers**. Thyroid follicles are atrophic and lined by epithelial cells with abundant eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm, termed **Hürthle cells** or oncocytes (a metaplastic response). Interstitial fibrosis is present but does not extend beyond the capsule. | Painless enlargement of the thyroid (goiter), usually associated with gradual onset of hypothyroidism. May be preceded by transient thyrotoxicosis (**hashitoxicosis**) from disruption of follicles. | Circulating autoantibodies against **thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO)** and **thyroglobulin (anti-Tg)**. During hypothyroid phase: increased TSH, decreased T4/T3. | - | Increased risk for other autoimmune diseases (Type 1 diabetes, SLE, Sjögren syndrome). Increased risk for development of extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of the thyroid. | Thyroid hormone replacement for hypothyroidism. |
| **Graves Disease** The most common cause of endogenous hyperthyroidism, characterized by a triad of hyperthyroidism, infiltrative ophthalmopathy, and infiltrative dermopathy. | Autoimmune disorder caused by the production of autoantibodies against the TSH receptor. | Peak incidence between 20-40 years of age. Affects women 10 times more frequently than men. Genetic susceptibility. | 1. **Hyperthyroidism**: An antibody subtype, **Thyroid-Stimulating Immunoglobulin (TSI)**, binds to the TSH receptor and mimics TSH action, stimulating adenyl cyclase and leading to increased thyroid hormone release. This process is not subject to normal negative feedback. 2. **Ophthalmopathy**: Activated T-cells (mainly CD4+ helper T cells) infiltrate the retro-orbital space. They secrete cytokines that stimulate fibroblast proliferation and synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins (hydrophilic glycosaminoglycans like hyaluronic acid). This causes edema, swelling of extraocular muscles, and accumulation of adipocytes, leading to exophthalmos. | Genetic susceptibility is associated with polymorphisms in:  * **CTLA4** * **PTPN22** * **IL2RA** * TSH receptor (**TSHR**) gene locus | Thyroid gland is symmetrically enlarged with a soft, "meaty" appearance resembling muscle, and a beefy deep red parenchyma. | **Thyroid**: Diffuse hypertrophy and hyperplasia of follicular epithelial cells. Cells are tall and columnar, forming small papillae that project into the follicle lumen (lacking fibrovascular cores). Colloid is pale with scalloped margins. Lymphoid infiltrates with germinal centers are common. **Orbit**: Tissues are edematous with infiltration by lymphocytes. Deposition of hydrophilic mucopolysaccharides. | Clinical features of thyrotoxicosis. Diffuse goiter, which may have an audible "bruit". **Infiltrative ophthalmopathy** causing exophthalmos (protrusion of eyeball) and diplopia. **Infiltrative dermopathy** (**pretibial myxedema**), presenting as scaly thickening and induration over the shins (minority of patients). | Elevated free T4 and T3, with depressed TSH. Presence of **Thyroid-Stimulating Immunoglobulin (TSI)**. Diffusely increased uptake of radioactive iodine on thyroid scan. | - | Increased risk for other autoimmune diseases (SLE, pernicious anemia, T1D, Addison disease). Thyroid storm. Corneal injury due to exophthalmos. | β-blockers, thionamides (e.g., propylthiouracil), radioiodine ablation, thyroidectomy. |
| **Diffuse Nontoxic (Simple) Goiter** Enlargement of the entire thyroid gland without producing nodularity. Also called colloid goiter. | Impaired synthesis of thyroid hormone, most often from dietary iodine deficiency. Leads to a compensatory rise in TSH, causing follicular cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia. | **Endemic**: Residing in geographic areas with low iodine levels (mountainous regions). Ingestion of goitrogens (e.g., vegetables of the Brassicaceae family like cabbage, cassava). **Sporadic**: Female predominance, puberty or young adult life. May be caused by hereditary enzyme defects (dyshormonogenetic goiter). | Two phases: 1. **Hyperplastic phase**: TSH stimulation leads to diffuse and symmetrical enlargement of the gland. 2. **Phase of colloid involution**: If iodine supply increases or demand for hormone decreases, the stimulated epithelium involutes, forming an enlarged, colloid-rich gland. Follicular epithelium becomes flattened. | Rarely, autosomal recessive hereditary enzymatic defects that interfere with thyroid hormone synthesis. | Diffusely and symmetrically enlarged gland, rarely exceeding 100-150g. In the colloid phase, cut surface is brown, glassy, and translucent. | **Hyperplastic phase**: Follicles are lined by crowded columnar cells, which may pile up into projections similar to Graves disease. **Colloid involution**: Follicles are large and filled with abundant colloid. The lining epithelium is flattened and cuboidal. | Most individuals are euthyroid. Clinical features are primarily related to mass effects from the enlarged gland (airway obstruction, dysphagia, cosmetic issues). | Serum T3 and T4 are normal. Serum TSH is usually elevated or at the upper range of normal. | * **Endemic**: Occurs when goiters are present in >10% of the population in a region. * **Sporadic**: Occurs less frequently. | Can convert into a multinodular goiter over time. In children, dyshormonogenetic goiter can cause cretinism. | Dietary iodine supplementation. Hormone replacement. |
| **Multinodular Goiter** Irregular enlargement of the thyroid produced by recurrent episodes of hyperplasia and involution. Derives from long-standing simple goiters. | Evolves from diffuse nontoxic goiter, so ultimate cause is impaired hormone synthesis (e.g., iodine deficiency). | Affects older individuals; same risk factors as simple goiter. | Believed to arise from variations among follicular cells in their response to TSH. Some cells with a growth advantage (perhaps due to acquired genetic mutations) proliferate to form a nodule. Recurrent hyperplasia and involution, coupled with physical stresses leading to hemorrhage, scarring, and calcification, produce an irregular, nodular gland. | Activating somatic mutations affecting the **TSH signaling pathway** (e.g., **TSHR** or **GNAS** genes) have been identified in a subset of autonomous ('hot') nodules. | Multilobulated, asymmetrically enlarged glands; can reach extreme sizes (>2000 g). May grow behind sternum (**intrathoracic or plunging goiter**). Cut section shows irregular nodules with variable amounts of brown, gelatinous colloid. Older lesions show hemorrhage, fibrosis, calcification, and cystic change. | Mixture of colloid-rich follicles lined by flattened, inactive epithelium and areas of follicular hyperplasia. Degenerative changes are common. A prominent capsule between hyperplastic nodules and residual compressed parenchyma is characteristically absent. | Dominant features are due to mass effects: airway obstruction, dysphagia, compression of neck vessels (**superior vena cava syndrome**). Most patients are euthyroid. Sudden changes in size or symptoms (hoarseness) can raise concern for malignancy. | Most are euthyroid, but some may have subclinical hyperthyroidism (reduced TSH). Radioiodine scan shows uneven iodine uptake, with areas of both increased and decreased activity, including occasional "hot" nodules. | - | **Plummer syndrome** (toxic multinodular goiter): development of hyperthyroidism in about 10% of patients. Low but non-zero incidence of malignancy (<5%). Can be mistaken for a neoplasm. | - |
| **Thyroid Adenoma (Follicular Adenoma)** A benign, discrete, solitary neoplasm derived from thyroid follicle epithelium. | Somatic mutations leading to constitutive activation of the TSH receptor signaling pathway. | Solitary nodules are more likely to be neoplastic. Higher incidence in women. | **Toxic adenomas**: Gain-of-function mutations cause follicular cells to secrete thyroid hormone independent of TSH stimulation ("thyroid autonomy"). **Nonfunctioning adenomas**: May harbor mutations that make them precursors to some follicular carcinomas. | * **Toxic adenomas**: Gain-of-function somatic mutations in **TSHR** (most common) or **GNAS**. Rarely seen in carcinomas. Some also have activating mutations of **EZH1**. * **Nonfunctioning adenomas**: Oncogenic mutations of **RAS** (20-40%) or fusions involving **PPARG** (5-10%). These are also seen in follicular carcinomas. | Solitary, spherical, encapsulated lesion with a well-defined, intact capsule. Averages 3cm. Bulges from cut surface, compresses adjacent thyroid. Color is gray-white to red-brown. Areas of hemorrhage, fibrosis, calcification, and cystic change are common. | The hallmark is the presence of an **intact, well-formed capsule encircling the tumor**. Neoplastic cells form uniform-appearing follicles containing colloid. The growth pattern is distinct from adjacent non-neoplastic thyroid. Cells show little variation in size or shape; mitoses are rare. May show **Hürthle cell (oxyphil) change**. | Usually present as a solitary, painless mass. Larger masses can cause difficulty swallowing. Functional ("toxic") adenomas cause hyperthyroidism. Nonfunctioning adenomas appear as "cold" nodules on radionuclide scans. | Definitive diagnosis requires histologic examination of the resected specimen to evaluate capsular integrity. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy is used for initial evaluation. | Can be functional ("toxic") or nonfunctional. Can have Hürthle cell (oxyphilic) features. | Nonfunctioning adenomas with certain mutations may be precursors to follicular carcinoma. Does not recur or metastasize. | Surgical removal (lobectomy or thyroidectomy) to exclude malignancy. |
| **Thyroid Carcinoma** Malignant neoplasms of the thyroid, most derived from follicle epithelium. | Distinct sets of driver mutations in cancer genes. A major risk factor is exposure to ionizing radiation, particularly in the first two decades of life. Dietary iodine deficiency is associated with a higher frequency of follicular carcinoma. | History of radiation treatment to head/neck. Younger patients, males (for solitary nodules). Family history (MEN-2 syndromes for medullary carcinoma). | Follows a model of multistep pathogenesis from precursor lesions:  1. Papillary microcarcinoma -> conventional PTC. 2. Noninvasive follicular neoplasm -> invasive follicular variant PTC. 3. Nonfunctioning follicular adenoma -> follicular carcinoma.  Most poorly differentiated and anaplastic carcinomas arise from well-differentiated PTC or follicular carcinomas through acquisition of additional mutations. | * **Papillary (PTC)**: Translocations involving **RET** or **NTRK1**, or point mutations in **BRAF** (V600E). * **Follicular**: Point mutations in **RAS**, or **PAX8-PPARG** translocation. Also PIK3CA or PTEN mutations. * **Anaplastic**: Mutations of **TP53**, **CTNNB1**, and **TERT** on top of drivers from PTC/follicular ca. * **Medullary**: Germline or somatic gain-of-function mutations in **RET**. | Variable. **PTC**: solitary or multifocal, may be cystic and calcified, can be infiltrative. **Follicular**: single nodules, may be well-circumscribed or widely infiltrative. **Anaplastic**: rapidly enlarging, bulky neck masses. **Medullary**: solitary nodule (sporadic) or bilateral/multicentric (familial). | **PTC**: Branching papillae with fibrovascular cores. Nuclear features are key: finely dispersed chromatin ("**Orphan Annie eye nuclei**"), nuclear pseudo-inclusions and grooves. **Psammoma bodies**. **Follicular**: Composed of uniform cells forming small follicles, reminiscent of normal thyroid. Diagnosis of carcinoma requires demonstrating **capsular or vascular invasion**. **Anaplastic**: Large pleomorphic giant cells, spindle cells, or mixed. **Medullary**: Polygonal/spindle cells in nests. Stromal **amyloid deposits** derived from calcitonin. | Often present as asymptomatic thyroid nodules. May manifest as a mass in a cervical lymph node (PTC). Advanced disease causes hoarseness, dysphagia, cough, dyspnea. Anaplastic carcinomas present as rapidly growing neck masses. Medullary carcinomas can cause paraneoplastic syndromes (diarrhea from VIP, Cushing from ACTH). | "Cold" nodules on scintigraphy. Fine-needle aspiration cytology is a reliable diagnostic test. Serum calcitonin and CEA for medullary carcinoma. Serum thyroglobulin for monitoring follicular carcinoma recurrence. | * **Papillary Carcinoma (85%)**: Includes conventional, follicular variant, tall cell variant, diffuse sclerosing variant. * **Follicular Carcinoma (5-15%)** * **Anaplastic (Undifferentiated) Carcinoma (<5%)** * **Medullary Carcinoma (5%)** | Lymphatic metastasis (common in PTC). Hematogenous metastasis (common in follicular, to bone, lungs, liver). Anaplastic carcinoma is highly aggressive and almost uniformly fatal. Medullary carcinoma is associated with MEN-2A and MEN-2B. | Thyroidectomy, radioactive iodine (for PTC and follicular), external beam radiation. For medullary carcinoma, prophylactic thyroidectomy in MEN-2 carriers. RET inhibitors. Immune checkpoint inhibitors for anaplastic carcinoma. |
| **Primary Hyperparathyroidism** An endocrine disorder due to autonomous overproduction of PTH, usually resulting in hypercalcemia. | * **Adenoma** (85-95%) * **Primary hyperplasia** (5-10%) * **Parathyroid carcinoma** (~1%)  Most cases are sporadic. | Adults, more common in women (4:1). Can be part of familial syndromes like MEN-1 and MEN-2. | Autonomous proliferation of parathyroid cells leads to uncontrolled PTH secretion. Excess PTH causes: 1. Increased bone resorption (osteoclast activity). 2. Increased renal tubular reabsorption of calcium. 3. Increased urinary phosphate excretion. 4. Increased synthesis of active vitamin D, augmenting GI calcium absorption. The net result is hypercalcemia, which fails to inhibit the autonomous parathyroid tissue. | * **Cyclin D1 (CCDN1) gene inversions**: Places gene under control of PTH gene promoter, causing overexpression (10-20% of adenomas). * **MEN1 mutations**: Somatic mutations in this tumor suppressor gene (~30-35% of sporadic adenomas). Germline mutations in MEN syndromes. * **CDC73 mutations**: Mutated in ~70% of sporadic parathyroid carcinomas. | **Adenoma**: Almost always a solitary, well-circumscribed, soft, tan-to-reddish-brown nodule (0.5-5g) with a delicate capsule. Other glands are normal or shrunken. **Hyperplasia**: Usually involves all four glands, but can be asymmetric. **Carcinoma**: Gray-white, irregular masses, may be invasive. | **Adenoma**: Composed mostly of uniform, polygonal chief cells. A rim of compressed, non-neoplastic parathyroid tissue is often visible at the edge. Adipose tissue is inconspicuous. **Hyperplasia**: Diffuse or multinodular pattern of chief cells. Stromal fat is decreased. **Carcinoma**: Invasion of surrounding tissues and metastasis are the only reliable criteria. | Most commonly diagnosed incidentally due to asymptomatic hypercalcemia. When symptomatic, classic presentation is "**painful bones, renal stones, abdominal groans, and psychic moans**". This includes bone pain, nephrolithiasis, GI disturbances (constipation, ulcers, pancreatitis), and CNS alterations (depression, lethargy). | Hypercalcemia with inappropriately elevated or normal serum PTH. Hypophosphatemia. Technetium-99m-sestamibi scan can help localize adenomas. | - | Skeletal: osteoporosis, **osteitis fibrosa cystica**, **brown tumors**. Renal: nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis. Peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, gallstones. | Surgical excision of the adenoma or hyperplastic glands. |
| **Secondary Hyperparathyroidism** A condition caused by chronic hypocalcemia, leading to compensatory overactivity of the parathyroid glands. | Renal failure is by far the most common cause. Other causes include inadequate dietary intake of calcium, steatorrhea, and vitamin D deficiency. | Chronic renal failure. | In chronic renal failure, pathogenesis is complex: 1. Decreased phosphate excretion leads to hyperphosphatemia. 2. Elevated phosphate directly depresses serum calcium. 3. Loss of renal substance reduces synthesis of active vitamin D, leading to reduced intestinal calcium absorption. 4. Chronic low calcium levels provide a sustained stimulus for PTH secretion, leading to parathyroid gland hyperplasia. | - | Parathyroid glands are hyperplastic, often asymmetrically. | Glands show an increased number of chief cells in a diffuse or multinodular pattern. Fat cells are decreased. Metastatic calcification may be seen in lungs, heart, stomach, and blood vessels. | Clinical features are usually dominated by the inciting chronic renal failure. Skeletal abnormalities (**renal osteodystrophy**) tend to be milder than in primary hyperparathyroidism. | Hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and elevated PTH levels. | - | **Renal osteodystrophy**. Vascular calcification resulting in ischemic damage (**calciphylaxis**). Some cases can become autonomous, leading to **tertiary hyperparathyroidism** with hypercalcemia. | Dietary vitamin D supplementation, phosphate binders. For tertiary hyperparathyroidism, parathyroidectomy may be necessary. |
| **Hypoparathyroidism** A condition caused by inadequate secretion of PTH, resulting in hypocalcemia. | * **Surgical**: Inadvertent removal of parathyroid glands during thyroidectomy (most common). * **Autoimmune**: Can be isolated or part of Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndrome Type 1 (APS-1). * **Congenital absence**: As part of **DiGeorge syndrome** (22q11 deletion). * **Genetic**: Autosomal dominant (gain-of-function **CASR** mutations) or recessive (**GCM2** mutations) forms. | History of neck surgery. Family history of genetic syndromes. | Lack of PTH leads to hypocalcemia because of decreased bone calcium resorption, decreased renal calcium reabsorption, and reduced active vitamin D synthesis. The hypocalcemia increases neuromuscular excitability. Paradoxically, calcification of tissues can occur, possibly due to increased phosphate levels leading to deposition of calcium phosphate. | * **AIRE**: Mutations in APS-1. * **CASR**: Gain-of-function mutations cause autosomal-dominant hypoparathyroidism. * **GCM2**: Loss-of-function mutations cause autosomal recessive FIH. | Glands are absent or destroyed. | - | The hallmark is **tetany**, due to neuromuscular irritability from hypocalcemia. Manifests as circumoral numbness, paresthesias, carpopedal spasm, and in severe cases, laryngospasm and seizures. Physical signs include **Chvostek sign** and **Trousseau sign**. Other features include mental status changes (anxiety, depression, psychosis), intracranial calcifications (basal ganglia), parkinsonian-like disorders, cataracts, and dental abnormalities. | Hypocalcemia with low or undetectable PTH levels. Hyperphosphatemia. | Can be acquired (surgical, autoimmune) or congenital/genetic. | Seizures, laryngospasm, cardiac arrhythmias (prolonged QT interval), cataracts. Associated with other disorders in APS-1 (candidiasis, adrenal insufficiency). **Pseudohypoparathyroidism**: a state of end-organ resistance to PTH, with normal/elevated PTH levels. | Calcium and vitamin D supplementation. |
