# [[Regional Injuries]] > Head Injury Subarachnoid Hemorrhage

### **Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)**

[[Subarachnoid hemorrhage]] is the accumulation of blood in the subarachnoid space (between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater). It is the most common form of traumatic intracranial hemorrhage.

---

### **Classification and Etiology**

SAH is broadly classified into two categories based on the cause:

#### **1. Traumatic SAH**
This is the most common type of SAH encountered in forensic practice.
*   **Direct Trauma:** Laceration of cortical vessels due to depressed skull fractures or penetrating injuries.
*   **Contusion:** Bleeding from cerebral contusions (coup or contrecoup) tracking into the subarachnoid space.
*   **Rotational/Shearing Forces:** Tearing of bridging veins or vessels in the pia-arachnoid.
*   **Basal SAH (Traumatic):** Often due to rupture of the [[vertebral artery]] (intracranial segment) resulting from a blow to the side of the neck, jaw, or face causing sudden hyperextension or rotation of the head.

#### **2. Spontaneous (Non-Traumatic) SAH**
*   **Rupture of Berry Aneurysm:** Accounts for 75-80% of spontaneous SAH.
    *   **Site:** Bifurcations in the [[Circle of Willis]] (90% in anterior circulation).
    *   **Precipitating factors:** Sudden rise in blood pressure due to physical exertion, emotional stress, sexual intercourse, or straining at stool.
*   **Arteriovenous Malformations (AVM):** Rupture of congenital vessel tangles.
*   **Hypertensive Hemorrhage:** Extension of an intracerebral bleed into the subarachnoid space (intraventricular extension).
*   **Rare causes:** Blood dyscrasias, leukemia, asphyxia.

> *   **B**erry Aneurysm
> *   **A**rteriovenous malformation
> *   **T**rauma (Most common)
> *   **S**troke

### **Clinical Features**

*   **Thunderclap Headache:** Sudden, severe headache, often described as "being kicked in the back of the head" or "the worst headache of my life".
*   **Meningism:** Neck stiffness (nuchal rigidity), photophobia, and positive Kernig's/Brudzinski's signs due to blood irritating the meninges.
*   **Consciousness:** Rapid deterioration of consciousness, confusion, or coma.
*   **Vomiting:** Projectile vomiting is common.
*   **Ocular signs:** Retinal hemorrhages (Terson’s syndrome) or papilledema (late sign).

### **Diagnosis**

1.  **CT Scan:** Non-contrast CT is the investigation of choice. It shows hyperdense (white) blood in the cisterns, sulci, and fissures.
2.  **Lumbar Puncture (LP):** Performed if CT is negative but clinical suspicion is high.
    *   **Findings:** CSF is uniformly bloody.
    *   **Xanthochromia:** Yellow discoloration of supernatant fluid due to bilirubin (breakdown product of hemoglobin). It appears **12 hours** after the bleed and differentiates true SAH from a "traumatic tap" (artefact during LP).

### **Autopsy Findings**

#### **External Examination**
*   Signs of external trauma to the head or neck (e.g., abrasions, bruises) may be present in traumatic cases.
*   In basal SAH due to vertebral artery trauma, external signs on the neck may be minimal or absent.

#### **Internal Examination**
1.  **Appearance:**
    *   **Patchy:** Thin film of red blood over the cerebral convexities (common in mild trauma).
    *   **Diffuse:** Thick layer of blood covering the brain surface, obscuring the sulci and gyri (common in severe trauma or ruptured aneurysm).
    *   **Basal:** Large clot at the base of the brain implies vertebral artery rupture or Berry aneurysm rupture.
2.  **Consistency:**
    *   Recent bleed: Bright red and fluid/clotted.
    *   Old bleed: Brownish/yellowish discoloration (hemosiderin staining) and thickened arachnoid (rust-like appearance).
3.  **The Washing Test:**
    *   **Subarachnoid Hemorrhage:** Blood is *beneath* the arachnoid membrane and held by trabeculae. It **cannot be washed away** by a gentle stream of water.
    *   **Subdural Hemorrhage:** Blood lies *above* the arachnoid. It **can** be easily washed away.

### **Differentiation: Traumatic vs. Spontaneous SAH**

| Feature | Traumatic SAH | Spontaneous SAH |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Common Cause** | Head injury, Vertebral artery trauma | Rupture of Berry Aneurysm |
| **Site of Bleed** | often over convexities (contusions), or basal (vertebral a.) | Usually basal (Circle of Willis) |
| **Associated Injuries** | Skull fractures, contusions, lacerations often present | usually absent (unless fall occurs after rupture) |
| **Vessels** | Normal anatomy | Aneurysm or AVM present |
| **Symmetry** | Often asymmetric | Often symmetric/diffuse at base |

### **Medicolegal Aspects**

1.  **Homicide vs. Natural Death:**
    *   A minor trauma (e.g., a slap or punch) during an altercation causes a physiological stress response (rise in BP), leading to the rupture of a pre-existing [[Berry aneurysm]].
    *   **Legal Stance:** The assailant is usually liable for the death (Culpable Homicide), as the act accelerated the death of the victim, even if the victim had a pre-existing condition (Section 299 IPC, Explanation 1).
2.  **Vertebral Artery Trauma:**
    *   A blow to the side of the upper neck (e.g., karate chop) can rupture the vertebral artery, leading to fatal massive basal SAH. This is a common method of homicide where external marks are minimal.
3.  **Alcohol and SAH:**
    *   Acute alcohol intoxication predisposes to traumatic SAH due to frequent falls and fights.
    *   It also increases cerebral blood flow, potentially aiding aneurysmal rupture.
4.  **Postmortem Artefacts:**
    *   Rough handling during brain removal can tear veins, mimicking SAH.
    *   Decomposition can cause lysis of blood cells and leakage into the subarachnoid space (false positive).
