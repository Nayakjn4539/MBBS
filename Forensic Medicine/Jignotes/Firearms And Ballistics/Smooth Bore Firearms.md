# [[Firearms And Ballistics]] > Smooth Bore Firearms

### Smooth Bore Firearms (Shotguns)

Smooth bore firearms are weapons where the interior of the barrel (bore) is smooth and lacks rifling grooves. The most common example is the [[Shotgun]]. These weapons are designed to fire multiple small projectiles (pellets/shots) or a single large lead projectile (slug) at relatively low velocities compared to rifles.

#### Classification
1.  **Mechanism of Loading:**
    *   **Breech Loading:** Cartridge inserted from the rear. Most modern shotguns.
    *   **Muzzle Loading:** Gunpowder and projectiles loaded from the front. Seen in historical weapons and some **country-made firearms**.
2.  **Barrel Configuration:**
    *   Single Barrel.
    *   Double Barrel: Side-by-side (DBBL) or Superimposed (Over-and-Under).
3.  **Action Mechanism:**
    *   Break action (Hinged).
    *   Pump action (Slide action).
    *   Bolt action.
    *   Semi-automatic (Autoloading).
4.  **Improvised Weapons:** [[Country-made firearms]] (Katta) or Zip guns. Usually smooth bore, made from water pipes or steering columns.

#### Nomenclature: The Gauge (Bore)
Unlike rifled firearms which use "caliber" (diameter in inches/mm), shotguns are designated by **Gauge** (or Bore).

*   **Definition:** The gauge number is the number of spherical lead balls, each having the exact diameter of the barrel, that together weigh **one pound** (454 gms).
*   **Relationship:** The *smaller* the gauge number, the *larger* the bore diameter.
    *   **12 Bore:** 12 lead balls fit the barrel to make 1 pound (Diameter ~ 0.729 inch). Most common.
    *   **16 Bore:** 16 balls make 1 pound (Diameter ~ 0.662 inch).
*   **Exception:** The **.410 musket** is measured in actual diameter (inches), not gauge.

#### The Shotgun Cartridge
> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Cross-section of a shotgun cartridge showing Primer, Gunpowder, Over-powder wad, cushion wad, lead pellets/shots, and Over-shot wad/crimp

A typical shotgun cartridge consists of:
1.  **Case:** Paper or plastic tube with a brass base.
2.  **Primer:** Center-fire percussion cap containing impact-sensitive explosive.
3.  **Propellant:** Gunpowder (Black powder or Smokeless powder).
4.  **[[Wad]]:** A disc of felt, cardboard, or plastic.
    *   **Functions:**
        *   Separates powder from pellets.
        *   Acts as a piston to seal gas behind the shot (Obturation).
        *   Lubricates the barrel.
    *   **Medicolegal Importance:** Wads travel a short distance (usually 10–15 yards). Finding a wad inside the wound or near the body indicates close-range firing.
5.  **Projectiles:** Lead shots (pellets) or Slugs.

#### Special Phenomena related to Smooth Bore Firearms

**1. Choking**
*   **Definition:** It is the constriction of the terminal few inches of the barrel at the muzzle end.
*   **Purpose:** To control the spread (dispersion) of the shots, keeping them grouped tighter for a longer distance, thereby increasing the effective range and velocity.
*   **Types of Choke:**
    *   *True Cylinder:* No constriction (broadest spread).
    *   *Improved Cylinder:* Slight constriction (0.1 mm).
    *   *Modified Choke:* Moderate constriction (0.25 mm).
    *   *Full Choke:* Maximum constriction (0.5 – 0.75 mm).

> **Mnemonic for Choke:** **F**ull choke = **F**arthest range (tightest group).

**2. Paradox Gun**
*   A hybrid firearm. It is primarily a smooth bore shotgun but has **rifling** in the terminal few inches (muzzle end) of the barrel.
*   **Purpose:** It allows the weapon to fire a solid slug with some spin (stability) for big game hunting, while still being able to fire birdshot.

**3. Balling of Shot (Welding)**
*   A phenomenon where multiple lead pellets fuse together due to the heat of the explosion or defects in the cartridge.
*   **Result:** The fused mass travels like a single solid bullet for a longer distance than expected.
*   **Medicolegal Significance:** Can produce a single large entry wound at a distance where dispersion (satellite holes) would normally be expected, leading to errors in range estimation.

**4. Billiard Ball Effect**
*   Occurs when pellets strike a bone or intermediate target. The pellets scatter widely *inside* the body or after the obstacle, simulating a wider dispersion pattern than the actual range would suggest.

#### Wound Ballistics: Characteristics of Shotgun Injuries

The appearance of the wound depends heavily on the **Range of Firing**.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Shotgun wound patterns at different ranges: Contact (stellate), Close (<1m circular), Intermediate (1-2m scalloped/rat-hole), Distant (>2m dispersion/satellite holes)

| Range | Characteristics of Entry Wound |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Contact / Tight Contact** | • Circular or Stellate (cruciate) shape due to gas expansion.<br>• **Muzzle impression** (abrasion ring) may be present.<br>• Cherry-red discoloration of underlying tissue (Carbon Monoxide).<br>• Wads found inside the wound track. |
| **Close Range (< 1 meter)** | • Single circular defect.<br>• **Burning, Blackening, and Tattooing** are present.<br>• Margins may be inverted.<br>• Wads likely inside the body. |
| **Intermediate (1 to 2 meters)** | • **"Rat-hole" appearance**: The main hole has scalloped/irregular margins as pellets begin to separate.<br>• No burning/blackening.<br>• Tattooing (powder) may be sparse or absent. |
| **Distant (> 2-3 meters)** | • **Satellite pellet holes** appear around the central defect.<br>• As distance increases, the central hole disappears, and only individual pellet holes are seen.<br>• **Dispersion Rule:** The spread of the shot pattern (in inches) is roughly equal to the distance from the muzzle (in yards). *(Note: Highly variable based on choke).* |

#### Medicolegal Aspects

1.  **Nature of Death:**
    *   **Suicide:** Common with long-barreled guns. Trigger often pulled by toe or using a string/stick. Site of election: Mouth, under chin, or chest.
    *   **Homicide:** Common. Large destructive wounds.
    *   **Accident:** Accidental discharge while cleaning or crossing obstacles (fence) is frequent.
2.  **Identification of Weapon:**
    *   **Difficult:** Unlike rifled weapons, smooth bore barrels do not leave unique striations (rifling marks) on the lead pellets.
    *   **Identification relies on:**
        *   Class characteristics: Gauge, Choke.
        *   Cartridge Case: Firing pin impression, breech face marks, and extractor marks on the brass base of the cartridge (these *are* unique).
3.  **Range Estimation:** More accurate in shotguns than rifles due to the predictable dispersion pattern of pellets and the presence/absence of wads.

#### Autopsy Findings

*   **External:**
    *   Measure the diameter of the spread of pellets.
    *   Check for [[Blackening]] (smoke) and [[Tattooing]] (unburnt powder).
    *   Look for wad abrasions or wads stuck in the wound.
*   **Internal:**
    *   **Lead Snowstorm:** X-ray finding showing multiple small radio-opaque shadows (pellets) scattered in the tissue.
    *   Massive tissue destruction and pulpification of organs at close range.
    *   **Wads:** Must be recovered. They indicate the gauge and make of the ammunition.
    *   **Pellets:** Recover as many as possible (but they cannot be matched to the barrel).
