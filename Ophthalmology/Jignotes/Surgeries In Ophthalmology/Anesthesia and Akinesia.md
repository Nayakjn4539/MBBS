# Anesthesia and Akinesia in Ophthalmic Surgery

Ocular surgery requires precise control over pain ([[anesthesia]]) and eye movement ([[akinesia]]). The choice of anesthesia depends on the patient's age, cooperation, systemic health, and the type of surgery planned.

## 1. Types of Ocular Anesthesia

### A. Topical (Surface) Anesthesia
This involves the instillation of anesthetic drops into the [[conjunctival sac]].
*   **Agents:**
    *   [[Proparacaine]] 0.5% (Most preferred).
    *   [[Lignocaine]] (Xylocaine) 2% to 4%.
    *   Amethocaine 1%.
*   **Method:** Instilled 4 times at 4-minute intervals,.
*   **Indications:**
    *   [[Phacoemulsification]] (in cooperative patients).
    *   Removal of superficial [[corneal foreign body]].
    *   [[Tonometry]] and [[Gonioscopy]].
    *   Suture removal.

### B. Regional (Infiltration) Anesthesia
This involves injecting the anesthetic agent into the orbital spaces to achieve both anesthesia and akinesia.
*   **Anesthetic Solution:** Usually a mixture of:
    *   2% Lignocaine (rapid onset).
    *   0.5% or 0.75% [[Bupivacaine]] (prolonged duration).
    *   [[Hyaluronidase]] (5 IU/mL): Promotes diffusion of the drug.
    *   Adrenaline (1:100,000): Prolongs duration and reduces bleeding (avoided in hypertension/cardiac disease).

#### 1. Retrobulbar Block
Injection is made into the **intraconal space** (muscle cone) behind the globe.
*   **Technique:** A needle is introduced at the junction of the middle and lateral third of the inferior orbital margin, directed backwards and medially towards the orbital apex.
*   **Volume:** 2–4 mL.
*   **Effects:**
    *   Anesthesia of the globe (Ciliary ganglion block).
    *   Akinesia of extraocular muscles (CN III, VI). **Note:** [[Superior oblique]] (CN IV) is often spared as it lies outside the muscle cone.
    *   Ocular hypotension.
*   **Complications:** [[Retrobulbar hemorrhage]], globe perforation, optic nerve injury, brainstem anesthesia,.

#### 2. Peribulbar Block
Injection is made into the **extraconal space** (peripheral surgical space).
*   **Technique:** Injections are usually given at two sites: Inferior (junction of lateral 1/3 and medial 2/3) and Superior (less common now). 6–9 mL of anesthetic is injected,.
*   **Mechanism:** The drug diffuses from the extraconal space into the muscle cone and lids.
*   **Advantages:** Safer than retrobulbar block (less risk of optic nerve injury), does not require a separate facial block.

#### 3. Sub-Tenon Block
*   **Technique:** Incision is made in the conjunctiva/Tenon's capsule, and a blunt cannula injects anesthetic into the [[sub-Tenon's space]].
*   **Advantages:** Avoids sharp needle complications (perforation/hemorrhage).

### C. General Anesthesia
*   **Indications:**
    *   Infants and children.
    *   Non-cooperative/mentally retarded adults.
    *   [[Perforating ocular injuries]] (open globe).
    *   Major orbital surgeries (e.g., [[enucleation]]).

## 2. Akinesia (Facial Nerve Blocks)

In standard retrobulbar anesthesia, the orbicularis oculi muscle is not paralyzed. To prevent the patient from squeezing the eyelids (which raises intraocular pressure), the [[facial nerve]] (CN VII) must be blocked.

### Techniques of Facial Block
| Technique | Site of Injection | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Van Lint Block]]** | Deeper tissues just above the eyebrow and below the inferior orbital margin (V-shape). | Blocks terminal branches of the facial nerve. |
| **[[O'Brien's Block]]** | Neck of the mandible (condyle), 1 cm anterior to the tragus. | Blocks the facial nerve trunk. |
| **[[Atkinson's Block]]** | Inferior margin of the zygomatic bone. | Blocks the superior branches of the facial nerve. |
| **[[Nadbath Block]]** | Near the stylomastoid foramen. | Blocks the main trunk of the facial nerve. |

**Mnemonic for Facial Blocks:**
**O**'Brien = **O**ver the Mandible.
**A**tkinson = **A**rch (Zygomatic).
**V**an Lint = **V**-shaped infiltration.

## 3. Ophthalmic Surgical Instruments

### A. Eye Speculums
Used to keep the eyelids apart during surgery (exposure).

| Type | Features | Uses |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Universal Metallic Speculum** | Has a spring mechanism and screw to adjust limbs. Can be used for Right or Left eye. | General intraocular surgeries. |
| **Guarded Speculum** (Solid Blade) | Has solid plates/blades attached to the limbs. | Keeps eyelashes away from the surgical field. Useful in laser procedures. |
| **Wire Speculum** ([[Barraquer]]) | Very light weight; minimizes pressure on the globe. | Preferred in pediatric cases or open globe injuries to prevent extrusion of contents. |

### B. Fixation and Holding Forceps
Used to stabilize tissues or the globe during manipulation.

1.  **Plain Forceps:**
    *   No teeth; serrations near the tip.
    *   **Use:** Tying sutures, holding conjunctiva.

2.  **[[Globe Fixation Forceps]] (Toothed):**
    *   Has 2x3 or 3x4 stout teeth.
    *   **Use:** Applied near the [[limbus]] to hold conjunctiva and episclera to stabilize the eyeball during surgery or [[forced duction test]].

3.  **[[Superior Rectus Holding Forceps]] (St. Martin's):**
    *   S-shaped double curve with 1x2 teeth.
    *   **Use:** To hold the superior rectus muscle belly while passing a [[bridle suture]] to fix the eye in downward gaze.

4.  **Corneoscleral Forceps ([[Colibri Forceps]] / Lim's):**
    *   Very fine 1x2 teeth at the tip.
    *   **Use:** Holding corneal or scleral edges during suturing (Cataract, Keratoplasty).

5.  **[[Iris Forceps]]:**
    *   Fine, delicate with 1x2 teeth.
    *   **Use:** To grasp the iris for [[iridectomy]].

6.  **[[Kelman-McPherson Forceps]]:**
    *   Fine forceps with bent limbs.
    *   **Use:** Holding IOL haptics, tearing anterior capsule in ECCE.

7.  **[[Capsulorhexis Forceps]]:**
    *   Very fine, sharp-tipped delicate forceps.
    *   **Use:** Creating Continuous Curvilinear Capsulorhexis ([[CCC]]).

### Clinical Implications
*   **Oculocardiac Reflex:** Traction on extraocular muscles (especially medial rectus) or retrobulbar block can cause bradycardia. **Management:** Stop stimulus, IV [[Atropine]].
*   **Retrobulbar Hemorrhage:** If this occurs, the eye becomes proptotic and tense ("hard eye"). Surgery must be postponed for at least a week to allow absorption.
*   **Perforation:** High myopes (long axial length) are at higher risk of globe perforation during retrobulbar/peribulbar blocks due to thin sclera and staphyloma.
