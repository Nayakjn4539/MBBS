# Obesity

### Definition
Obesity is defined as an abnormal growth of the adipose tissue due to an enlargement of fat cell size ([[hypertrophic obesity]]) or an increase in fat cell number ([[hyperplastic obesity]]) or a combination of both. It is a state of [[body weight]] that is 10 to 20% in excess of the ideal body weight.

### Epidemiological Determinants (Risk Factors)
Obesity is a disease of multiple causation involving the interaction of the host and the environment.

**1. Host Factors**
*   **Age:** Generally increases with age. Infants with excessive weight gain have a higher incidence of obesity later in life.
*   **Sex:** Women generally have a higher rate of obesity than men. Women's [[BMI]] tends to increase by 1kg per pregnancy,.
*   **Genetic Factors:** There is a genetic component (approx 50-60% for abdominal fat). Twin studies show concordance even in dissimilar environments.
*   **Endocrine Factors:** Rare causes include Cushing's syndrome and Growth Hormone deficiency.

**2. Environmental & Behavioral Factors**
*   **Diet:** High intake of energy-dense foods (fats, refined carbohydrates), snacking, and "junk food",.
*   **Physical Inactivity:** Sedentary lifestyle is a major contributor. Reduced energy output is often more critical than increased intake.
*   **Socio-economic Status:** In developing countries, obesity is often associated with *higher* socio-economic status, whereas in affluent societies, it is inversely related (more common in lower classes).
*   **Psychosocial Factors:** Emotional disturbances, depression, and anxiety can lead to overeating (comfort eating).
*   **Alcohol:** Generally positive relationship for men and negative for women regarding adiposity.

### Assessment of Obesity
Diagnosis is based on body fat measurement and various indices.

#### 1. Body Mass Index (BMI) or [[Quetelet's Index]]
This is the most widely used index for classification.
*   **Formula:** $BMI = \frac{Weight (kg)}{Height (m)^2}$.

**Table: Classification of Weight Status based on BMI**,,

| Classification | Global Standards (WHO) | Asian Standards | Indian Consensus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Underweight** | < 18.5 | < 18.5 | < 18.5 |
| **Normal** | 18.5 – 24.9 | 18.5 – 22.9 | 18.5 – 22.9 |
| **Overweight** | 25.0 – 29.9 | 23.0 – 24.9 | 23.0 – 24.9 |
| **Obesity** | $\ge$ 30.0 | $\ge$ 25.0 | $\ge$ 25.0 |

> **Note:** South Asians have 3–5% higher body fat for the same BMI compared to Caucasians, necessitating lower cut-offs.

#### 2. Waist Circumference (WC) and Waist:Hip Ratio (WHR)
These measure [[central obesity]] (Android/Apple shape), which is a better predictor of cardiovascular risk than generalized obesity.
*   **Waist Circumference Cut-offs:**
    *   *Global:* Men > 102 cm; Women > 88 cm.
    *   *India:* Men > 90 cm; Women > 80 cm.
*   **Waist:Hip Ratio (WHR) Cut-offs:**
    *   Men > 1.0 (or > 0.90) indicate obesity.
    *   Women > 0.85 indicate obesity,,.

#### 3. Skinfold Thickness
*   Measured using [[Harpenden skin callipers]] at four sites: Mid-triceps, biceps, sub-scapular, and supra-iliac.
*   **Standard:** Sum > 40mm in boys and > 50mm in girls indicates obesity.

#### 4. Other Indices
*   **Broca's Index:** $Ideal Weight (kg) = Height (cm) - 100$.
*   **Corpulence Index:** $\frac{Actual Weight}{Desirable Weight}$ (Should not exceed 1.2).
*   **Waist:Height Ratio (WHtR):** Cut-off is 0.5. Considered age and sex-independent.

### Clinical Relevance: Hazards of Obesity
Obesity is a key risk factor for [[Non-Communicable Diseases]] (NCDs).

*   **Morbidity:**
    *   **Cardiovascular:** Hypertension, [[Coronary Heart Disease]] (CHD), Varicose veins.
    *   **Metabolic:** Type 2 Diabetes (strongest association), Dyslipidemia, Gallbladder disease,.
    *   **Mechanical:** Osteoarthritis (knees, hips), Flat feet, Hernias.
    *   **Cancers:** Endometrial, Breast (post-menopausal), Colon.
*   **Mortality:** Increased risk of sudden death and reduced life expectancy.

**Mnemonic for Complications: "O-B-E-S-I-T-Y"**
*   **O**steoarthritis
*   **B**reathlessness (Sleep Apnea)
*   **E**ndocrine (Diabetes, PCOS)
*   **S**troke / Stone (Gallstones)
*   **I**schaemic Heart Disease
*   **T**hrombosis (DVT)
*   **Y**-chromosome issues (Infertility/Libido)

### Prevention and Control

#### 1. Dietary Changes
*   Reduce energy-dense foods (fats, simple sugars).
*   Increase dietary [[fiber]] (fruits, vegetables, unrefined foods).
*   Balanced diet principles (Prudent Diet).

#### 2. Physical Activity
*   Essential for increasing energy expenditure.
*   Promotes weight maintenance and reduction of CVD risk.

#### 3. Levels of Prevention
*   **Primordial Prevention:** Preventing the emergence of risk factors in populations where they have not yet appeared (e.g., school health programs preventing sedentary habits).
*   **Primary Prevention:** Identifying "at-risk" groups (e.g., family history) and intervening with diet/exercise before obesity occurs.
*   **Secondary Prevention:** Early diagnosis (BMI screening) and treatment (dieting, drugs, bariatric surgery for morbid obesity).
