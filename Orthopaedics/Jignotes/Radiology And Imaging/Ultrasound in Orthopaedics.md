# [[Radiology And Imaging]] > Ultrasound in Orthopaedics

### Ultrasound in Orthopaedics

[[Diagnostic ultrasound]] utilizes high-frequency sound waves generated by a transducer to create images of musculoskeletal structures. As sound waves pass through tissue interfaces, some are reflected back (echoes) to the transducer, converted into electrical signals, and displayed as real-time images.

#### Basic Principles and Physics
*   **Mechanism:** High-frequency sound waves penetrate soft tissues. Tissues with different densities reflect waves differently.
*   **Image Generation:**
    *   **Hyperechoic (Bright/White):** Structures that reflect high-intensity signals (e.g., cortical bone, fascia, fibrous tissue).
    *   **Hypoechoic (Dark/Grey):** Structures with intermediate signal intensity (e.g., muscle, cartilage).
    *   **Anechoic (Black):** Fluid-filled structures (e.g., cysts, effusion, blood vessels).
*   **Equipment:** Simple and portable; usually involves a monitor and a probe (transducer).

#### Advantages and Limitations

| **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Non-invasive:** No surgical exposure required. | **Bone barrier:** Sound waves cannot penetrate cortical bone deeply; only the surface is visible. |
| **No Ionizing Radiation:** Safe for repeated use, pregnancy, and children. | **Operator Dependent:** Quality relies heavily on the skill of the sonographer. |
| **Real-time imaging:** Allows dynamic assessment (e.g., tendon movement). | **Obesity:** Poor penetration in patients with high BMI or excessive subcutaneous fat. |
| **Cost-effective:** Cheaper than [[MRI]] or [[CT scan]]. | **Artifacts:** Shadowing and other artifacts can obscure pathology. |
| **Portable:** Can be used at the bedside or in the ER. | |

#### Clinical Indications in Orthopaedics

**1. Paediatric Orthopaedics**
*   **[[Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip]] (DDH):**
    *   Ultrasound is the **gold standard** for screening and diagnosis in infants (up to 4–6 months) because the femoral head is cartilaginous and not visible on plain [[X-ray]].
    *   It allows visualization of the cartilaginous [[femoral head]] and the [[acetabulum]].
    *   **Dynamic Stressing:** Can assess stability (Barlow and Ortolani maneuvers) in real-time.
    *   **Graf’s Classification:** Used to grade the severity of dysplasia based on alpha and beta angles measured on USG.
*   **Transient Synovitis vs. Septic Arthritis:** Useful for detecting joint effusion in a limping child and guiding aspiration.

**2. Soft Tissue Pathologies**
*   **Swellings and Lumps:** Differentiates between **cystic** (fluid-filled) and **solid** masses.
    *   *Cystic:* [[Ganglion]], [[Popliteal cyst]] (Baker's cyst), [[Abscess]], [[Hematoma]].
    *   *Solid:* Lipoma, fibroma, tumors.
*   **Tendons and Ligaments:**
    *   **Rotator Cuff:** Evaluation of [[supraspinatus tendon]] tears (partial vs. full thickness).
    *   **Achilles Tendon:** Diagnosis of rupture or tendinitis.
    *   **Tenosynovitis:** Visualization of fluid within the tendon sheath.

**3. Bone and Joint Infections**
*   **[[Acute Osteomyelitis]]:**
    *   Can detect a **subperiosteal abscess** (collection of pus beneath the periosteum) before bony changes appear on X-ray.
    *   Useful for early diagnosis when X-rays are normal (first 10–14 days).
*   **[[Septic Arthritis]]:**
    *   Highly sensitive for detecting intra-articular fluid (effusion).
    *   Can distinguish simple effusion from complex fluid (echogenic debris suggests pus or blood).
*   **[[Skeletal Tuberculosis]]:**
    *   Used to detect and measure the size of a [[cold abscess]] (e.g., psoas abscess).
    *   Helps in monitoring the response to anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) by measuring abscess regression.

**4. Trauma**
*   **[[FAST]] (Focused Assessment Sonography for Trauma):**
    *   Used in polytrauma to rapidly detect free fluid (blood) in the abdomen, pelvis, or pericardium.
    *   Replaces diagnostic peritoneal lavage.
*   **Vascular Assessment:**
    *   **Doppler Ultrasound:** Essential for checking arterial patency and detecting [[deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT) in postoperative or trauma patients.
    *   Confirms presence of distal pulses in fractures/dislocations (e.g., knee dislocation).
*   **Soft Tissue Injuries:** detecting muscular tears or large hematomas.

**5. Interventional Orthopaedics**
*   **Guided Procedures:** Ultrasound provides real-time visual guidance for:
    *   **Aspiration:** Joint effusions, abscesses, or hematomas.
    *   **Biopsy:** Soft tissue masses.
    *   **Injections:** Intra-articular steroid injections or nerve blocks.
    *   **Vascular Access:** Insertion of [[central venous catheter]] or difficult IV lines.

#### Specific Diagnostic Signs

*   **Debris in Fluid:** Suggests infection (pus) or hemarthrosis.
*   **Posterior Acoustic Enhancement:** Seen behind cystic structures (waves travel through fluid easily, making tissues behind it appear brighter).
*   **Posterior Acoustic Shadowing:** Seen behind calcifications, bone, or foreign bodies (waves are blocked, creating a dark shadow).

#### Clinical Implications
*   **Screening:** Indispensable for neonatal hip screening programmes.
*   **Emergency:** Quickest way to rule out intra-abdominal bleeding in unstable trauma patients.
*   **Differentiation:** The "third eye" of the clinician to differentiate a pulsatile [[aneurysm]] from an abscess before sticking a needle in it (Safety first!).
