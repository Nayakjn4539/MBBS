# Sialolithiasis (Salivary Gland Calculus)

### Definition
**Sialolithiasis** refers to the formation of stones (calculi) within the parenchyma or the ductal system of the [[salivary glands]]. It is an obstructive pathology leading to salivary stasis and inflammation.

### Epidemiology and Distribution
*   It accounts for more than **50%** of major salivary gland diseases.
*   **Gender:** Men > Women.
*   **Age:** Common in adults aged 30–60 years; rare in children.
*   **Site Distribution:**
    *   **[[Submandibular gland]] (Wharton's duct):** 80–90% (Most Common).
    *   **[[Parotid gland]] (Stensen's duct):** 10–20%.
    *   **Sublingual gland:** Rare (~1%).

### Etiopathogenesis
The exact etiology is uncertain, but salivary stasis, ductal inflammation, and injury are contributing factors.

#### Why is the Submandibular Gland most commonly affected?
The [[Submandibular gland]] is predisposed to calculus formation due to specific anatomical and physiological factors:
1.  **Duct Anatomy:** [[Wharton's duct]] is longer, has a larger caliber, and a tortuous course.
2.  **Anti-gravity flow:** The duct is angulated around the **mylohyoid muscle**, requiring secretions to travel vertically against gravity.
3.  **Chemical Composition:** Secretions are **alkaline**, which favors precipitation of salts.
4.  **Consistency:** The saliva is **viscous** (mucinous) compared to the serous secretions of the parotid.
5.  **Mineral Content:** Higher concentration of **Calcium** and **Phosphates**.

> *   **L**ong duct
> *   **P**hosphate/Thick fluid (Viscous)

### Composition of Calculi
*   **Nature:** Similar to tartar.
*   **Inorganic (75%):** Mainly **Calcium phosphate** and **Calcium carbonate**; small amounts of magnesium, potassium, and ammonium.
*   **Organic:** Glycoproteins, mucopolysaccharides, and cellular debris.

### Clinical Features
*   **Cardinal Symptom:** Recurrent episodes of **postprandial salivary colic** (pain and swelling of the gland during or after meals).
*   **Swelling:**
    *   Intermittent swelling of the involved gland.
    *   May become persistent if secondary infection ([[sialadenitis]]) supervenes.
*   **Physical Examination:**
    *   **Inspection:** A stone may be visible at the duct orifice (punctum).
    *   **Palpation:**
        *   **Bimanual palpation** (intraoral finger + extraoral finger) is crucial for the submandibular gland.
        *   Stones are felt as hard, palpable masses along the course of the duct.
        *   Tenderness indicates active inflammation.
    *   **Purulent Discharge:** Pus may be expressed from the duct orifice if infected.

### Diagnostic Investigations

| Modality | Findings/Utility |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Plain Radiography** | **X-ray Occlusal View:** Best for floor of mouth/submandibular stones. <br> **Lateral Oblique View:** For parotid stones. <br> *Note:* **80–90%** of submandibular stones are **radio-opaque**; Parotid stones are often radiolucent (only 10% parotid stones are visible on X-ray). |
| **[[Ultrasound]]** | Can detect stones **>2 mm**. Useful for radiolucent stones. Shows acoustic shadowing. |
| **[[CT Scan]]** | **Most sensitive** method. Excellent for visualizing small calculi, multiple stones, and parenchymal stones. Fine cuts required. |
| **[[Sialography]]** | Contrast study of the ductal system. Useful for radiolucent stones, strictures, or sialectasis. <br> **Contraindication:** Acute infection/sialadenitis (can worsen sepsis). |
| **[[Sialoendoscopy]]** | Minimally invasive; allows direct visualization of the ductal system and simultaneous retrieval of stones. |

### Differential Diagnosis
*   **Lymphadenopathy:** Submandibular or upper cervical lymph nodes.
*   **[[Ranula]] (Plunging):** Soft, cystic swelling; cross-fluctuation present.
*   **Tumors:** Salivary gland neoplasms (usually painless and slow-growing).
*   **Dental Abscess:** Associated with carious teeth.

### Treatment and Management

#### 1. Medical (Conservative) Management
Indicated for small stones or acute inflammation.
*   **Hydration:** To dilute saliva.
*   **Sialogogues:** Sour candy/lemon drops to stimulate flow and flush small stones.
*   **Antibiotics:** If associated with infection ([[sialadenitis]]).
*   **Analgesics/Anti-inflammatories:** For pain and edema.
*   **Milking/Massage:** Manual expression of stones located near the duct orifice.

#### 2. Surgical Management
Depends on the size and location of the stone.

*   **Intraoral Removal (Duct Incision):**
    *   Indicated for stones in the **distal** part of the duct (within 2 cm of the orifice).
    *   The duct is incised over the stone, the stone is delivered, and the duct is usually left open (marsupialization) or repaired (sialodochoplasty) to prevent stenosis.

*   **[[Sialadenectomy]] (Gland Excision):**
    *   Indicated for:
        *   Stones located within the **gland parenchyma** or at the **hilum**.
        *   Multiple stones or recurrent stone formation.
        *   Chronic sialadenitis with an atrophic gland.
    *   Submandibular gland excision is done via a transcervical approach. Parotidectomy may be required for deep parotid stones.

*   **Minimally Invasive Techniques:**
    *   **[[Sialoendoscopy]]:** Use of wire baskets or graspers to remove small mobile stones.
    *   **Lithotripsy:**
        *   **Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL):** Fragments stones to be flushed out naturally.
        *   **Intracorporeal Lithotripsy:** Laser or pneumatic fragmentation via endoscope.

### Complications
*   **Acute Suppurative [[Sialadenitis]]:** Infection behind the obstruction.
*   **Chronic Sialadenitis:** Gland atrophy and fibrosis due to long-term obstruction.
*   **Abscess Formation:** Potential spread to deep neck spaces (e.g., Ludwig's angina).
*   **Ductal Stricture:** Post-inflammatory or post-surgical scarring.
