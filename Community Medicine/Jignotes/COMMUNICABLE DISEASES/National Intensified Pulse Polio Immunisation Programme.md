# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > National Intensified Pulse Polio Immunisation Programme

### [[National Intensified Pulse Polio Immunisation Programme]] (IPPI)

The **Intensified Pulse Polio Immunization (IPPI)** programme represents a strategic shift from the original Pulse Polio Immunization (PPI) initiative to ensure 100% coverage by reaching every child, specifically those missed during booth-based activities.

### **1. Concept and Definition**
*   **Pulse Polio:** The term "Pulse" refers to the **sudden, simultaneous, mass administration** of [[Oral Polio Vaccine]] (OPV) on a single day to all children in the 0–5 age group, regardless of their previous immunization status.
*   **Why "Pulse"?** This method aims to flood the community with the attenuated vaccine virus, which replaces the wild poliovirus in the environment and interrupts transmission.
*   **Intensified PPI (IPPI):** The "Intensification" involves adding a **"house-to-house search-and-vaccinate"** component immediately following the fixed booth days to trace and vaccinate children who were missed.

### **2. Objectives**
*   To **interrupt the transmission** of the wild poliovirus.
*   To achieve **100% coverage** of the target population.
*   To **replace the wild virus** in the community with the vaccine virus.

### **3. Target Group and Timing**
*   **Target Age:** All children from **0 to 5 years** of age.
*   **Timing:** Conducted during the **low transmission season** (usually November to February in India) when the viral load in the environment is lowest.
*   **Frequency:** Generally, two rounds are conducted about **4 to 6 weeks apart**.

### **4. Operational Strategy: The "IPPI" Approach**
The IPPI operates on a rigorous schedule to ensure no child is left behind.

*   **Day 1: Fixed Booth Activity (National Immunization Day - NID)**
    *   Vaccination is carried out at fixed polling booths/centers.
    *   Extensive social mobilization is used to bring children to the booths.
    *   Children vaccinated are marked (usually on the little finger of the left hand) to distinguish them.

*   **Day 2 & 3: House-to-House Activity**
    *   **Search and Vaccinate:** Health workers visit **every house** in their assigned area.
    *   **Tracking Missed Children:** They identify children who were not vaccinated on Day 1 (checking finger markers) and administer OPV to them at home.
    *   **Marking Houses:** Houses are marked (e.g., 'P' for protected, 'X' for missed children) to track coverage and revisit if necessary.

*   **Transit Teams:**
    *   Special teams are deployed at transit points like railway stations, bus stands, and market places to vaccinate children in transit.

### **5. Key Features**
*   **Supplementary Doses:** The OPV doses given during IPPI are **extra doses**. They **do not replace** the doses received during routine immunization services. There is no minimum interval required between a PPI dose and a routine scheduled dose.
*   **Cold Chain Maintenance:** Strict maintenance of the cold chain is critical. The **[[Vaccine Vial Monitor]] (VVM)** is a mandatory heat-sensitive label on OPV vials to ensure potency at the point of administration.
*   **Sub-National Immunization Days (SNIDs):** Apart from NIDs (covering the whole country), SNIDs are conducted in high-risk states or pockets (like UP, Bihar) to maintain high immunity levels.

### **6. Important Milestones and Status**
*   **Launch:** PPI was launched in India in **1995-96**.
*   **The Switch (2016):** In April 2016, India switched from **Trivalent OPV (tOPV)** to **Bivalent OPV (bOPV)** (containing only P1 and P3 strains) during campaigns, as Wild Poliovirus Type 2 was eradicated.
*   **Victory:** The last case of wild polio in India was reported on **13th January 2011** (Howrah, West Bengal). India was certified **Polio-Free** by WHO on **27th March 2014**.

### Clinical Relevance: Why IPPI matters?
Even after certification, IPPI rounds continue (though less frequently) because:
1.  **Risk of Importation:** Wild virus exists in neighboring endemic countries (Afghanistan, Pakistan).
2.  **VDPV Risk:** To maintain high herd immunity and prevent **[[Vaccine Derived Polio Virus]] (VDPV)** emergence, which occurs in populations with low immunity.
3.  **Surveillance:** It supports the **Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP)** surveillance network by keeping the machinery active.

*   **A** - **A**ffordable/Accessible Vaccines (OPV)
*   **F** - **F**ixed Booths (NIDs)
*   **E** - **E**nvironmental Surveillance (Sewage sampling)
*   **P** - **P**ulse Polio (House-to-House/Intensified)
