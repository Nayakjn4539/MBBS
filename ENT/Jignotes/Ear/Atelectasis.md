### Middle Ear Atelectasis

**Definition**
Middle ear atelectasis refers to the collapse or severe retraction of the [[tympanic membrane]] (TM) towards the middle ear structures due to negative intratympanic pressure and the loss of stiffness in the membrane. It signifies the partial or total absence of gas within the middle ear cleft.

**Etiopathogenesis**
The development of atelectasis is multifactorial, involving the interplay between ventilation and membrane integrity.

*   **[[Eustachian Tube Dysfunction]] (ETD):** This is the primary underlying cause. Failure of the ET to ventilate leads to the absorption of middle ear gases (oxygen and nitrogen) into the blood, creating negative middle ear pressure.
*   **Mastoid Pneumatization:** Patients with atelectasis often have sclerotic (poorly pneumatized) mastoids. A small mastoid air cell system provides a poor "air reservoir" to buffer pressure changes.
*   **TM Atrophy (Dimeric Membrane):** Chronic inflammation (e.g., sequelae of [[Otitis Media with Effusion]] or "Glue Ear") leads to the dissolution of the middle **collagenous fibrous layer** of the pars tensa. The TM becomes thin, atrophic, and compliant, making it susceptible to inward collapse even with mild negative pressures.

**Clinical Features**
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Hearing Loss:** Usually conductive, varying from mild to moderate. Surprisingly, hearing may remain relatively good if the retracted TM transmits sound effectively to the stapes (known as the "nature's myringostapediopexy").
    *   **Ear Fullness:** A sensation of blockage or pressure.
    *   **Asymptomatic:** Early stages may be detected incidentally.

*   **Otoscopic Signs:**
    *   Dull, lusterless appearance of the TM.
    *   **Foreshortening of the [[Malleus]]:** The handle of the malleus appears shorter because it is rotated medially.
    *   **Prominent Lateral Process:** Due to the medial rotation of the malleus handle.
    *   **Draping:** The TM looks like "saran wrap" draped over the [[incus]], [[stapes]], and [[promontory]].
    *   **Sickled Folds:** The anterior and posterior malleolar folds become prominent and sickle-shaped.

**Classification of Tympanic Membrane Retraction**

Proper grading is essential for management and follow-up.

**1. Sade Classification (Pars Tensa Retraction)**
This is the standard system used for the [[pars tensa]].

| Grade | Description | Clinical Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Grade I** | Mild retraction of the TM. | Not touching incus/stapes. |
| **Grade II** | Retraction contacting the **[[incus]]** or **[[stapes]]**. | Middle ear mucosa is intact. |
| **Grade III** | **Atelectasis:** TM touches the **[[promontory]]**. | Not adherent; can move with pneumatic otoscopy or nitrous oxide. Middle ear space obliterated. |
| **Grade IV** | **Adhesive Otitis Media:** TM is **adherent** to the promontory. | Fixed; does not move with suction/siegelization. Mucosal lining is lost. |

**2. Tos Classification (Pars Flaccida Retraction)**
Used for retractions in the attic region (Shrapnell's membrane).

| Stage | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Stage I** | Slight retraction; dimpled but not adherent to malleus. |
| **Stage II** | Retraction adherent to the neck of the **[[malleus]]**; full extent visible. |
| **Stage III** | Deep retraction pocket; outer attic wall erosion (scutum); part of the fundus is hidden. |
| **Stage IV** | Deep retraction with **[[cholesteatoma]]**; erosion of attic walls and ossicles. |

**Sequelae and Complications**
If left untreated or if the ETD persists, atelectasis can lead to irreversible damage:
1.  **Ossicular Erosion:** The retracted TM exerts pressure on the ossicles. The most common site of necrosis is the **long process of the incus** (lenticular process) and the **stapes superstructure** due to impaired blood supply.
2.  **[[Adhesive Otitis Media]]:** The final stage (Sade Grade IV) where the TM adheres to the medial wall, obliterating the middle ear space. Fibrous adhesions form between the TM and the promontory.
3.  **Cholesteatoma Formation:** Deep retraction pockets (especially in the attic or posterosuperior quadrant) lose their ability to self-clean. Keratin debris accumulates, leading to primary acquired [[cholesteatoma]].

**Diagnosis**
*   **[[Pneumatic Otoscopy]] (Siegelization):** Critical to distinguish between Grade III (mobile/liftable) and Grade IV (adherent/fixed) atelectasis.
*   **Microscopy:** Essential to visualize the depth of retraction pockets and check for keratin debris.
*   **Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA):** Assesses the degree of conductive hearing loss.
*   **Tympanometry:** Usually shows a Type C (negative pressure) or Type B (flat) curve if fluid or severe retraction is present.

**Management**

Treatment depends on the grade of retraction, hearing status, and presence of infection.

**Conservative/Medical Management:**
*   **Observation:** For mild, stable retractions (Grade I & II) with good hearing. Serial monitoring is required.
*   **Valsalva Maneuver:** To auto-inflate the middle ear (if no active infection).
*   **Treat Underlying Cause:** Manage adenoids, allergy, or sinusitis to improve ET function.

**Surgical Management:**
*   **Ventilation Tubes ([[Grommet]]):**
    *   *Indication:* Grade II or early Grade III to aerate the middle ear and push the TM back to position.
    *   *Risk:* Can cause further atrophy or tympanosclerosis at the insertion site.
*   **[[Tympanoplasty]]:**
    *   *Indication:* Grade III/IV with significant hearing loss or ossicular erosion.
    *   *Technique:* Often requires **cartilage tympanoplasty** to reinforce the drum and prevent recurrent retraction.
*   **Ossiculoplasty:** If the incus or stapes are eroded.
*   **Hearing Aids:** A non-surgical option for patients with significant hearing loss who are unfit for or refuse surgery.

**Clinical Implications:**
*   **"Cholesteatoma Hearer":** In severe atelectasis or cholesteatoma, the retraction mass may bridge the gap between the malleus and stapes footplate (replacing the eroded incus). This transmits sound effectively. Removing this mass during surgery can paradoxically worsen hearing; patients must be warned of this risk.
*   **Nitrous Oxide Sign:** During anesthesia, if N2O is used, it diffuses into the middle ear space. If the TM is atelectatic (Grade III), it may "balloon" out, distinguishing it from an adherent (Grade IV) drum.
