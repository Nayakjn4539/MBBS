# Plague
**(Synonyms: Black Death, Mahamari)**

Plague is a specific zoonosis caused by *Yersinia pestis*, primarily affecting rodents and transmitted to humans by fleas. While often considered a disease of the past, natural foci remain, posing a threat of re-emergence.

### Epidemiological Determinants

**1. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** [[Yersinia pestis]] (formerly *Pasteurella pestis*).
*   **Characteristics:** Gram-negative, non-motile coccobacillus.
*   **Identification:** Shows **Bipolar Staining** (Safety Pin appearance) with [[Wayson's stain]] or Giemsa stain.
*   **Survival:** Can survive and multiply in the soil of rodent burrows for months.

**2. Host Factors**
*   **Natural Reservoir:** Wild rodents (e.g., *Tatera indica* in India, gerbils). This constitutes **Sylvatic/Wild Plague**.
*   **Intermediate Host:** Domestic rats (e.g., *Rattus rattus*, *Rattus norvegicus*). These act as liaison hosts bridging the gap between wild rodents and humans (**Domestic Plague**).
*   **Human Host:** Accidental host. All ages/sexes susceptible. No natural immunity.

**3. Vector**
*   **Vector:** Rat flea ([[Xenopsylla cheopis]]).
*   **Mechanism:** **Blocked Flea**. The bacilli multiply in the flea's proventriculus, blocking the gut. The starving flea bites ferociously and regurgitates bacteria into the wound.
    *   *Note:* A **partially blocked flea** is more dangerous epidemiologically than a totally blocked flea because it survives longer.

### Transmission Dynamics

| Mode | Description | Clinical Form |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bite of Infected Flea** | Most common route. Bubonic plague results from the bite of an infected rat flea. | Bubonic Plague |
| **Droplet Infection** | Direct human-to-human transmission via respiratory droplets. Highly infectious. | Pneumonic Plague |
| **Direct Contact** | Handling infected animal tissues (hunters, lab workers). | Bubonic/Septicemic |

*   **Risk of Human-to-Human Transmission:** Very High in [[Pneumonic Plague]]; Negligible in Bubonic Plague unless there is direct contact with pus.

### Clinical Features

**Incubation Period:**
*   **Bubonic Plague:** 2 – 7 days.
*   **Pneumonic Plague:** 1 – 3 days (Shortest).

**Clinical Forms:**
1.  **Bubonic Plague:**
    *   Most common form.
    *   Acute onset fever, chills, headache.
    *   **Bubo:** Painful, tender, enlarged lymph nodes (commonly inguinal, axillary, or cervical) draining the site of the bite.
2.  **Pneumonic Plague:**
    *   Can be primary (inhalation) or secondary (spread from bubonic).
    *   Blood-tinged, watery sputum loaded with bacilli.
    *   Rapid deterioration; almost 100% fatal if untreated within 24 hours.
3.  **Septicemic Plague:**
    *   Massive bacteremia without palpable buboes. High mortality.

### Diagnosis

1.  **Microscopy:** Smear from bubo aspirate/sputum stained with Wayson’s stain shows **Bipolar safety-pin appearance**.
2.  **Culture:** Definitive diagnosis. Isolation of *Y. pestis*.
3.  **Serology:** Passive hemagglutination test.
4.  **Rapid Tests:** F1 antigen detection.

### Treatment

Treatment must begin immediately on clinical suspicion without waiting for lab confirmation.

*   **Drug of Choice:** [[Streptomycin]] (30 mg/kg/day IM in 2 divided doses for 7-10 days).
*   **Alternatives:** Tetracycline, Doxycycline, Gentamicin.
*   **Pneumonic Plague:** Strict isolation is required.

---

### Prevention and Control

**1. Control of Fleas (Vector Control)**
*   **Crucial Rule:** Insecticides must be applied **BEFORE** rodenticides.
*   *Reason:* If rats are killed first, the hungry fleas leave the dead bodies and bite humans, causing an outbreak.
*   **Method:** Insufflation of rat burrows with **10% DDT dust** or BHC/Malathion (if resistant).

**2. Control of Rodents**
*   Trapping and rodenticides (e.g., [[Zinc Phosphide]]).
*   Sanitation measures to reduce food/shelter for rats.

**3. Chemoprophylaxis**
*   Recommended for close contacts (especially of pneumonic plague).
*   **Drug:** [[Tetracycline]] (500 mg QID) or Doxycycline for 5–7 days.

**4. Vaccination**
*   **Vaccine:** Killed vaccine (Haffkine's vaccine/Formalin killed).
*   **Indication:** Prevention in high-risk groups; *not* for controlling an active epidemic.
*   **Immunity:** Short-lived (approx. 6 months).

### Plague Surveillance Indices

These indices measure the density of fleas and risk of transmission.

1.  **Specific Flea Index ([[Cheopis Index]]):**
    *   Average number of *X. cheopis* fleas per rat.
    *   **Significance:** An index **> 1** indicates a potential for an epidemic.
2.  **Total Flea Index:** Average number of fleas of all species per rat.
3.  **Percentage of Excavation:** % of rats infested with fleas.

### Mnemonic
**"P-L-A-G-U-E"**
*   **P** - **P**neumonic is person-to-person (Droplet).
*   **L** - **L**ymph nodes enlarged (Bubo).
*   **A** - **A**ntibiotics (Streptomycin/Tetracycline).
*   **G** - **G**ram negative **B**ipolar staining (**B** = Bubonic).
*   **U** - **U**nder control via DDT (Fleas first!).
*   **E** - **E**xtremely rapid death in Pneumonic form.
