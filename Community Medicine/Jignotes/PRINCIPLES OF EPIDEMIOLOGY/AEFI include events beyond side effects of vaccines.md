# [[PRINCIPLES OF EPIDEMIOLOGY]] > AEFI include events beyond side effects of vaccines

### **Introduction to AEFI: Beyond Side Effects**

In medical epidemiology, it is a fundamental error to equate an [[Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI)]] solely with the side effects of a vaccine. An AEFI is defined as **any untoward medical occurrence** which follows immunization and which **does not necessarily have a causal relationship** with the usage of the vaccine,.

The event may be any unfavorable or unintended sign, abnormal laboratory finding, symptom, or disease. The key concept to grasp is **Temporality vs. Causality**: just because an event occurred *after* vaccination does not mean it was *caused* by the vaccine.

### **Classification of AEFI**

The [[Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS)]] and WHO revised the classification (2012) to categorize these events based on their specific cause. Only the first two categories below represent actual "side effects" or issues with the vaccine itself.

| **Category** | **Description** | **Example** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Vaccine Product-related Reaction** | An event caused by the inherent properties of the vaccine. This is what is traditionally called a **"side effect."** | Extensive limb swelling following [[DTP vaccination]]. |
| **2. Vaccine Quality Defect-related Reaction** | An event caused by a defect in the vaccine product (manufacturing or administration device defect). | Failure to completely inactivate the virus during manufacturing (e.g., Cutter incident leading to paralytic polio)., |
| **3. Immunization Error-related Reaction** | An event caused by inappropriate handling, prescribing, or administration. These are **preventable** and often called **Programmatic Errors**. | Transmission of infection by a non-sterile injection; abscess due to wrong technique. |
| **4. Immunization Anxiety-related Reaction** | An event arising from anxiety about the immunization, not the vaccine itself. | [[Vasovagal syncope]] (fainting) in an adolescent during or after vaccination. |
| **5. Coincidental Event** | An event that happens after immunization but is caused by something else. It is only **temporally associated**. | A fever occurs after vaccination but is actually caused by underlying [[Malaria]] or [[Pneumonia]]. |

### **Detailed Breakdown of Events "Beyond Side Effects"**

To fully answer the question, we must focus on categories 3, 4, and 5, which prove that AEFI includes events *other* than vaccine side effects.

#### **1. Immunization Error-Related Reactions (Programmatic Errors)**
These are the most common source of AEFI clusters and are entirely preventable. They result from human or system error, not vaccine toxicity.

*   **Non-sterile injection:** Can lead to local abscesses, sepsis, or transmission of [[Blood-borne viruses]] (HIV, HBV, HCV).
*   **Reconstitution errors:**
    *   Using the wrong diluent (can cause toxic shock).
    *   Using a drug (like insulin or muscle relaxant) instead of a diluent due to similar vial appearance.
*   **Wrong route/site:** Injecting [[BCG vaccine]] subcutaneously instead of intradermally can cause severe local reactions or lymphadenitis.
*   **Cold Chain Failures:** Freezing vaccines that are freeze-sensitive (like DPT or Hepatitis B) causing sterile abscesses due to aluminum adjuvant precipitation,.

#### **2. Immunization Anxiety-Related Reactions**
This is a physiological response to fear, not a toxicological response to the chemical.
*   **Fainting (Syncope):** Common in adolescents.
*   **Hyperventilation:** Dizziness, tingling around the mouth.
*   **Mass Psychogenic Illness:** In school-based campaigns, if one child faints or vomits due to anxiety, others may follow suit without any organic cause.

#### **3. Coincidental Events**
Vaccines are often given to infants and children during the exact age window when other common illnesses (infections, congenital anomalies becoming apparent) occur.
*   **Chance Association:** If a child is vaccinated in the morning and develops high fever from a pre-existing viral infection in the evening, the fever is an AEFI (temporally related) but is *coincidental* (not causally related),.
*   **Importance:** Distinguishing these is vital to maintain public confidence in immunization programs.

### **Mnemonic**

To remember the **5 Categories** of AEFI (**V**accine product, **Q**uality defect, **I**mmunization error, **A**nxiety, **C**oincidental):

**"V**ery **Q**uiet **I**nterns **A**ct **C**ool"

*   **V**ery = **V**accine product-related (The true side effect)
*   **Q**uiet = **Q**uality defect-related (Bad batch)
*   **I**nterns = **I**mmunization error-related (Human error/Programmatic)
*   **A**ct = **A**nxiety-related (Fear/Fainting)
*   **C**ool = **C**oincidental (Just bad timing)

---

### **Clinical Relevance**

*   **Investigation:** When a cluster of AEFIs occurs (e.g., multiple children developing abscesses), the primary suspect is usually a **Programmatic Error** (unsterile needles or wrong technique) rather than a bad vaccine batch.
*   **Contraindications:** A true anaphylactic reaction to a vaccine (Category 1) is a contraindication for future doses. However, a vasovagal syncope (Category 4) or a coincidental fever (Category 5) are **NOT** contraindications.
*   **Public Trust:** Misidentifying a coincidental event (like a SIDS death occurring days after vaccination) as a vaccine side effect can destroy public trust and lead to disease outbreaks (e.g., the Measles resurgence).
