# [[Diseases Of Lens]] > Complications of Cataract Surgery

### Classification of Cataract Surgery Complications

Complications can be broadly classified based on the time of onset relative to the surgery:

| **Phase** | **Complications** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Operative (Intra-operative)** | • [[Posterior Capsular Rupture]] (PCR)<br>• [[Vitreous loss]]<br>• [[Expulsive choroidal hemorrhage]]<br>• [[Descemet membrane detachment]]<br>• Iris injury/dialysis |
| **Early Post-operative** (Days to weeks) | • [[Acute Bacterial Endophthalmitis]]<br>• [[Hyphaema]]<br>• [[Iris prolapse]]<br>• Striate keratopathy<br>• Flat/shallow [[Anterior chamber]]<br>• [[Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome]] (TASS) |
| **Late Post-operative** (Months to years) | • [[Posterior Capsular Opacification]] (PCO)<br>• [[Cystoid Macular Edema]] (CME)<br>• [[Retinal detachment]]<br>• [[Pseudophakic bullous keratopathy]]<br>• [[Intraocular lens]] dislocation (Sunset/Sunrise syndrome) |

### 1. Posterior Capsular Opacification (PCO)
Also known as **"After Cataract"** or **"Secondary Cataract"**. It is the most common late complication of cataract surgery.

#### Etiopathogenesis
*   **Cause:** Proliferation and migration of residual [[lens epithelial cells]] left behind in the capsular bag after extracapsular extraction.
*   **Time of Onset:** Usually months to years after surgery. Can occur in 10-50% of patients within 3-5 years.

#### Clinical Types
1.  **Elschnig’s Pearls:**
    *   Caused by proliferation of subcapsular epithelial cells.
    *   They become vacuolated and cluster like soap bubbles along the posterior capsule.
    *   Common in younger patients.
2.  **Soemmering’s Ring:**
    *   A thick ring of after-cataract formed behind the [[iris]].
    *   Occurs when residual cortex is trapped between the anterior and posterior capsule borders.
3.  **Fibrous Type:**
    *   Thickening and fibrosis of the posterior capsule due to metaplasia of epithelial cells.

#### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:** Gradual, painless diminution of vision (blurring), glare, and uniocular diplopia.
*   **Signs:** Opacity visible behind the [[Intraocular lens]] (IOL) on slit-lamp examination.

#### Management
*   **Nd:YAG Laser Capsulotomy:** The treatment of choice. It creates an opening in the posterior capsule (photodisruption).
*   **Surgical Membranectomy:** Performed if the membrane is too dense or laser is unavailable.

> **Clinical Implication:** Square-edged IOLs reduce the incidence of PCO by creating a barrier to epithelial cell migration.

### 2. Cystoid Macular Edema (CME)
Fluid accumulation in the outer plexiform layer (Henle's layer) and inner nuclear layer of the [[retina]], centered around the foveola.

#### Irvine-Gass Syndrome
When CME occurs specifically as a complication of cataract surgery, it is termed **Irvine-Gass Syndrome**.
*   **Peak Incidence:** 6–10 weeks post-operatively.
*   **Risk Factors:** Vitreous loss, incarcerated vitreous in the wound (vitreous wick syndrome), diabetes, uveitis, and use of prostaglandin analogues.

#### Pathogenesis
Inflammation releases mediators (prostaglandins) $\rightarrow$ Breakdown of blood-retinal barrier $\rightarrow$ Leakage from perifoveal capillaries $\rightarrow$ Fluid accumulation in retinal layers.

#### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:** Painless decrease in central vision, [[metamorphopsia]] (distorted vision), and positive scotoma.
*   **Signs:** Loss of foveal depression, retinal thickening.

#### Diagnosis
*   **Fundoscopy:** "Honeycomb appearance" at the macula.
*   **Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA):** Characteristic **"Flower Petal"** appearance due to leakage.
*   **Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT):** Cystic spaces visible in the retina; currently the gold standard for diagnosis.

#### Treatment
*   **Prophylaxis:** Topical [[NSAIDs]] (e.g., Nepafenac, Ketorolac) pre- and post-operatively.
*   **Curative:**
    *   Topical NSAIDs + Topical Steroids.
    *   Systemic [[Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors]] (Acetazolamide).
    *   Periocular or Intravitreal Steroids (Triamcinolone) for resistant cases.
    *   Anti-VEGF agents.

### 3. Endophthalmitis
A devastating, suppurative inflammation of the inner coats of the eye (vitreous and aqueous) involving all structures **except the sclera**. It is a true ocular emergency.

#### Classification & Etiology

| **Type** | **Onset** | **Common Organisms** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Acute Post-operative** | Within 1-7 days | **[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]** (Coagulase-negative Staph - most common), *Staph aureus*, *Pseudomonas*. |
| **Late Onset** | Weeks to months | *Propionibacterium acnes* (sequestered in capsular bag), Fungi. |
| **Traumatic** | Following injury | *Bacillus cereus*, mixed flora. |
| **Endogenous** | Metastatic spread | *Klebsiella*, *Candida*. |

**Note:** *Staphylococcus epidermidis* is the most common source, often from the patient's own eyelid/conjunctival flora.

#### Clinical Features
**Symptoms:**
*   Severe ocular pain (often worsening after initial improvement).
*   Redness and watering.
*   Sudden, marked loss of vision.

**Signs:**
*   **Lids:** Edema and erythema.
*   **Conjunctiva:** Chemosis and congestion.
*   **Cornea:** Hazy, edema.
*   **Anterior Chamber:** **[[Hypopyon]]** (pus in AC), fibrinous exudates.
*   **Vitreous:** Vitritis, loss of red reflex (yellow glow/amaurotic cat's eye reflex).

#### Differential Diagnosis
*   **Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome (TASS):** Sterile inflammation occurring within 24 hours (very early), usually due to chemicals/preservatives. Pain is less severe than infectious endophthalmitis.

#### Management
Based on the **Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study (EVS)** guidelines.

**1. Investigation:**
*   **Vitreous Tap/Biopsy:** Essential for gram stain and culture (Gold standard).
*   Sample taken from mid-vitreous.

**2. Treatment:**
*   **Intravitreal Antibiotics (Mainstay):**
    *   **Vancomycin** (1 mg/0.1 ml) - covers Gram-positive.
    *   **Ceftazidime** (2.25 mg/0.1 ml) or **Amikacin** - covers Gram-negative.
*   **Steroids:** Intravitreal Dexamethasone (400 $\mu$g) may be given to reduce inflammation (controversial in fungal cases).
*   **Vitrectomy (Pars Plana Vitrectomy - PPV):**
    *   Indicated if vision is **Light Perception (PL)** or worse.
    *   Helps remove infectious load and toxins.
*   **Systemic Antibiotics:** Have poor penetration but are often used (e.g., Ciprofloxacin, Moxifloxacin).
