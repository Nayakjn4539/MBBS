# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Vaccination campaign against Measles and Rubella is going to start in a block. Prepare appropriate health education plan for this campaign.

### Health Education Plan for Measles-Rubella (MR) Vaccination Campaign

**Plan Overview:**
A [[Health Education]] plan acts as a blueprint to bridge the gap between health services and community acceptance. For the Measles-Rubella (MR) campaign, the strategy focuses on the **"Catch-up"** component, targeting a wide age group (9 months to 15 years) to eliminate measles and control [[Congenital Rubella Syndrome]] (CRS),.

---

#### 1. Situation Analysis & Data Collection (Diagnosis)
Before launching, assess the community baseline:
*   **Target Population:** All children aged **9 months to 15 years**, irrespective of previous vaccination status or disease history,.
*   **Community Beliefs:** Identify rumors (e.g., infertility myths) or [[Vaccine Hesitancy]] in specific pockets.
*   **Resources:** Identify available [[ASHA]], Anganwadi workers (AWW), and school teachers as influencers,.

---

#### 2. Objectives of the Health Education Plan
**SMART Objectives** (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound):
1.  **Awareness:** To inform 100% of parents/guardians about the date, time, and venue of the campaign within 2 weeks.
2.  **Knowledge:** To educate the community that MR vaccine prevents **Pneumonia** (Measles complication) and **Birth Defects** (Rubella complication),.
3.  **Behavior:** To achieve >95% vaccination coverage in the block during the campaign.
4.  **Trust:** To neutralize rumors regarding vaccine safety and adverse effects.

---

#### 3. Content of the Message (The "What")
The message must be simple, consistent, and in the local language.

**Key Messages to Disseminate:**
*   **The "Big One":** MR Vaccine is safe, effective, and free. It is given as a single shot (0.5 ml, Subcutaneous, Right Upper Arm).
*   **Why Rubella?** While rubella is mild in kids, it causes **blindness, deafness, and heart defects** in newborns if a pregnant woman gets infected. We vaccinate children to stop transmission to pregnant mothers.
*   **Irrespective of History:** Even if the child has been vaccinated for measles before or has had the disease, this campaign dose is **essential** to boost immunity.
*   **Safety:** The syringe is **Auto-Disable (AD)** (breaks after single use), preventing cross-infection.
*   **Contraindications:** Do *not* vaccinate only if the child has high fever or is hospitalized. Minor cough/cold is **NOT** a contraindication.

> **Mnemonic for Measles Complications (Why we vaccinate):**
> **"M-E-A-S-L-E-S"**
> *   **M** - Malnutrition/ Mouth ulcers
> *   **E** - Eye damage (Blindness due to Vit A deficiency)
> *   **A** - Acute Diarrhea
> *   **S** - **SSPE** (Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis - rare but fatal)
> *   **L** - Laryngotracheobronchitis (Croup)
> *   **E** - Ear infection (**Otitis Media** - Most Common)
> *   **S** - Severe Pneumonia (Most common cause of death)
> *[Clinical Relevance: Vitamin A is given with measles vaccine to prevent blindness]*.

#### 4. Methodology & Channels of Communication (The "How")
A mix of approaches is required to reach all strata of the block.

| Approach Level | Target Audience | Method/Channel | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Individual** | Hesitant parents, dropouts | **Home Visits** (Interpersonal Communication - IPC) | [[ASHA]] / AWW |
| **Group** | Mothers, School children | **Focus Group Discussions (FGD)**, School Assemblies, [[Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committee]] (VHSNC) meetings | ANM, Teachers, Sarpanch |
| **Mass** | General Public | Miking (Auto-rickshaw announcements), Posters at Panchayat/Schools, Wall paintings | Block Extension Educator (BEE) |

**Specific Settings:**
1.  **School-Based Campaign:** Since the target is up to 15 years, schools are the primary site. Teachers must check diaries/calendars to inform parents.
2.  **Outreach Sessions:** For non-school going children, utilize Anganwadi centers and Sub-centers.

#### 5. Implementation Strategy
*   **Pre-Campaign (2 Weeks Prior):**
    *   Sensitization workshop for teachers and principals.
    *   Meeting with religious leaders to dispel rumors (crucial in resistance pockets).
    *   Distribution of **IEC materials** (pamphlets, consent forms).
*   **During Campaign:**
    *   Inauguration by a local dignitary (increases credibility).
    *   **Managing AEFI:** Inform parents that mild fever/rash is a normal immune response. Keep [[AEFI]] management kits ready at session sites to build confidence.
*   **Post-Campaign:**
    *   Mop-up rounds for missed children (Left-outs and Drop-outs).

---

#### 6. Monitoring and Evaluation
*   **Process Indicators:** Number of IEC sessions held, number of pamphlets distributed.
*   **Outcome Indicators:** Vaccination coverage percentage (Target >95%).
*   **Feedback:** Rapid coverage survey (30-cluster survey) to assess if messages reached the target audience.
