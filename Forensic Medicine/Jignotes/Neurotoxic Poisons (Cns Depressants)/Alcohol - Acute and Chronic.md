# [[Neurotoxic Poisons (Cns Depressants)]] > Alcohol - Acute and Chronic

### **Alcohol (Ethanol)**

**Group:** [[Neurotoxic Poisons]] (Inebriants/CNS Depressants)
**Source:** Produced by fermentation of sugars by yeast (up to 15%) and distillation (for higher concentrations).

---

### **Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism**
*   **Absorption:** Rapidly absorbed from the stomach (20%) and small intestine (80%).
*   **Metabolism:** 90–98% is oxidized in the [[liver]].
    *   **Enzyme Pathway:** Ethanol $\xrightarrow{Alcohol \ Dehydrogenase}$ [[Acetaldehyde]] $\xrightarrow{Aldehyde \ Dehydrogenase}$ Acetic Acid $\rightarrow$ CO2 + H2O.
*   **Excretion:** 2–10% excreted unchanged through breath, urine, and sweat.
*   **Rate of Elimination:** Roughly 15–20 mg% per hour.

### **Acute Alcohol Poisoning**

It occurs due to deliberate heavy drinking. The clinical features depend on the [[Blood Alcohol Concentration]] (BAC).

#### **Stages of Intoxication**

| Stage | BAC (mg%) | Clinical Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Stage of Excitement** | 30 – 100 | • **Loss of inhibition:** Increased confidence, talkative, garrulous.<br>• **Euphoria:** Sense of well-being.<br>• **Altered Behavior:** Normal manners forgotten, may reveal secrets.<br>• **Reaction time:** Increased (slowed reflexes). |
| **2. Stage of Incoordination** | 100 – 300 | • **CNS:** Slurred speech, staggering gait (ataxia), diplopia.<br>• **Nystagmus:** [[Alcohol Gaze Nystagmus]] (jerking movement in direction of gaze).<br>• **Autonomic:** Flushed face, rapid pulse, dilated pupils.<br>• **Judgment:** Impaired; reckless driving occurs here. |
| **3. Stage of Narcosis (Coma)** | > 300 | • **CNS:** Deep sleep/stupor progressing to coma.<br>• **Respiration:** Stertorous breathing (snoring).<br>• **Pupils:** Constricted (pin-point) but dilate on painful stimuli ([[MacEwan's Sign]]).<br>• **Temperature:** Hypothermia.<br>• **Death:** Respiratory paralysis or aspiration of vomit. |

#### **Diagnosis of Acute Intoxication**
1.  **Smell:** Characteristic odor of alcohol (actually due to congeners) in breath.
2.  **Physical Signs:** Congested conjunctiva, nystagmus, tremors, unsteady gait.
3.  **Tests:**
    *   **Breath Analyzer:** For screening.
    *   **Blood Analysis:** Gold standard (Gas Chromatography).
    *   **Urine Analysis:** For correlation (Urine alcohol : Blood alcohol = 1.3 : 1).

#### **Treatment of Acute Poisoning**
1.  **Airway protection:** Place in recovery position to prevent aspiration.
2.  **Gastric Lavage:** Useful within 1-2 hours. Use warm water/sodium bicarbonate.
3.  **IV Fluids:** To correct dehydration and hypotension.
4.  **Glucose + Thiamine:** Administer **Thiamine (100 mg)** *before* or with glucose to prevent precipitation of [[Wernicke's Encephalopathy]].
5.  **Hemodialysis:** Indicated if BAC > 400-500 mg% or severe acidosis.

### **Chronic Alcoholism**

Long-term habitual use leads to tolerance and multi-system damage.

#### **1. Psychiatric Syndromes**
*   **[[Delirium Tremens]] (Withdrawal):** Occurs 2-5 days after cessation.
    *   *Symptoms:* Anxiety, sweating, coarse tremors, **visual hallucinations** (seeing animals/insects), terrifying delusions.
*   **[[Wernicke's Encephalopathy]] (Acute):** Due to Thiamine (Vit B1) deficiency.
    *   **Mnemonic: GOA**
        *   **G**lobal confusion
        *   **O**phthalmoplegia (CN VI palsy)
        *   **A**taxia
*   **[[Korsakoff's Psychosis]] (Chronic):**
    *   Irreversible condition.
    *   Features: Anterograde/Retrograde amnesia + **Confabulation** (filling memory gaps with imaginary events).
*   **Alcoholic Hallucinosis:** Auditory hallucinations in a clear sensorium.
*   **Alcoholic Paranoia:** Fixed delusions of jealousy (Othello syndrome) regarding spouse's fidelity.

#### **2. Systemic Pathology**
*   **Liver:** Fatty liver $\rightarrow$ Alcoholic Hepatitis $\rightarrow$ [[Cirrhosis]] (Laennec's).
*   **GIT:** Gastritis, Peptic ulcers, Pancreatitis, Mallory-Weiss tear.
*   **CVS:** Dilated cardiomyopathy, Hypertension, **Holiday Heart Syndrome** (arrhythmias after binge drinking).
*   **CNS:** Peripheral neuropathy, Marchiafava-Bignami disease (corpus callosum degeneration).

### **Autopsy Findings**

#### **Acute Poisoning**
*   **External:**
    *   Smell of alcohol from mouth/nose.
    *   Face flushed/cyanosed.
    *   [[Postmortem Lividity]]: Deep red (due to reduced oxyhemoglobin).
    *   [[Rigor Mortis]]: Persists longer.
    *   [[Decomposition]]: Retarded.
*   **Internal:**
    *   **Stomach:** Mucosa is hyperemic, congested, and coated with mucus (**Velvety appearance**). Contents smell of alcohol.
    *   **Lungs:** Edema, congestion (Frothy fluid in bronchi).
    *   **Brain:** Congested, wet, and edematous. Meninges congested.

#### **Chronic Alcoholism**
*   **Liver:** Fatty change (yellow, greasy) or Cirrhosis (hobnail liver).
*   **Stomach:** Chronic gastritis (atrophic mucous membrane).
*   **Heart:** Fatty degeneration, [[Munich Beer Heart]] (hypertrophy/dilatation).
*   **Kidneys:** Chronic nephritis (granular).

### **Medicolegal Aspects**

1.  **Drunkenness vs. Under the Influence:**
    *   **Consumed alcohol:** Smell present, but tests negative/low.
    *   **Under the influence:** Faculties (judgment/coordination) impaired due to alcohol.
    *   **Drunkenness (Medical definition):** A condition where a person has lost control of his faculties to such an extent that he is unable to execute safely the occupation in which he is engaged at the material time.
2.  **Consent:** Always obtain informed consent before examination (unless arrested under specific sections like 53 CrPC).
3.  **Collection of Blood:**
    *   Do **NOT** use alcohol/spirit to clean the skin (use soap/water or betadine).
    *   **Preservative:** **Sodium Fluoride** (100mg for 10ml) + **Potassium Oxalate** (30mg). Fluoride prevents enzyme action (glycolysis) and bacterial production of alcohol.
4.  **[[Widmark's Formula]]:** Used to estimate the quantity of alcohol in the body.
    *   **Formula:** $a = p \times r \times c$
        *   $a$ = Weight of alcohol in grams.
        *   $p$ = Body weight in kg.
        *   $r$ = Constant (0.68 for men, 0.55 for women).
        *   $c$ = Concentration of alcohol in blood (mg/kg).
5.  **Traffic Offenses (India):**
    *   **Sec 185 Motor Vehicles Act:** Punishable if BAC > **30 mg%** (30 mg/100ml).
6.  **Criminal Responsibility:**
    *   **Sec 85 IPC:** Involuntary intoxication (defense available—total acquittal).
    *   **Sec 86 IPC:** Voluntary intoxication (knowledge of crime is presumed, intent may be argued).
