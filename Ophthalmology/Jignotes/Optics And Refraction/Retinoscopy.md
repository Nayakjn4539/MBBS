# Retinoscopy

**Synonyms:** Skiascopy, Shadow Test.

### Definition and Principle
[[Retinoscopy]] is an objective method of determining the refractive error of the eye by the method of neutralization.
*   **Principle:** When light is reflected from a mirror into the eye, the direction in which the light travels across the pupil depends upon the refractive state of the eye.
*   **Goal:** To locate the **far point** ([[punctum remotum]]) of the patient's eye.
*   **Neutralization Point:** When the far point of the patient's eye corresponds to the [[nodal point]] of the observer's eye, a neutral point is reached. At this point, the pupil appears completely illuminated or completely dark, and movement ceases.

### Prerequisites and Equipment
To perform retinoscopy effectively, the following are required:
1.  **Darkroom:** Preferably 6 meters long (or converted using a plane mirror).
2.  **Trial Box:** Containing spherical and cylindrical lenses, pinhole, occluder, and prisms.
3.  **Trial Frame:** Adjustable frames.
4.  **Vision Box:** Snellen's self-illuminated chart.
5.  **Retinoscope.**

### Types of Retinoscopes
| Type | Description | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mirror Retinoscope** | Examples: [[Priestley-Smith retinoscope]]. | Uses an external source of light placed above/behind the patient. Can have a plane or concave mirror. |
| **Self-Illuminated** | **Spot Retinoscope**: Projects a circular beam. <br> **Streak Retinoscope**: Projects a linear streak. | **Streak** is the most popular/common type. It is more sensitive in detecting [[astigmatism]]. |

### Procedure
1.  **Patient Position:** The patient sits at a distance of **1 meter** (or 66 cm/arm's length) from the examiner.
2.  **Fixation:** The patient is instructed to look at a far point (infinity) to relax [[accommodation]]. If a cycloplegic is used, the patient can look at the light.
3.  **Observation:** The examiner throws light into the patient's eye and observes the **red reflex** through the peephole of the mirror.
4.  **Movement:** The mirror/streak is moved horizontally and vertically, and the movement of the red reflex within the pupil is compared to the movement of the external band.

### Interpretation of Red Reflex Movement
**Using a Plane Mirror at 1 Meter Distance:**

| Movement of Reflex | Interpretation | Refractive State |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **No Movement** | Point of reversal achieved. | [[Myopia]] of exactly 1 Dioptre (1D). |
| **With Movement** | Reflex moves in the *same* direction as the mirror. | [[Hypermetropia]], [[Emmetropia]], or Myopia < 1D. |
| **Against Movement** | Reflex moves in the *opposite* direction to the mirror. | Myopia > 1D. |

> **Note:** If a **concave mirror** is used, the movements are reversed (i.e., "Against" movement indicates Hypermetropia).

**Characteristics of the Reflex:**
The appearance of the reflex changes as the error of refraction is approached:
*   **Speed:** Slow in high refractive errors; Rapid in low errors.
*   **Brilliance:** Dull in high errors; Bright in low errors.
*   **Width:** Narrow in high errors; Wide in low errors (fills the pupil near neutralization).

### Neutralization
Neutralization is the process of adding lenses to stop the movement of the reflex.
*   **"With" movement:** Corrected by adding **Convex (+)** spherical lenses.
*   **"Against" movement:** Corrected by adding **Concave (-)** spherical lenses.
*   **Astigmatism:** If the reflex moves at different speeds or directions in different meridians, each meridian is neutralized separately using cylindrical lenses. With a streak retinoscope, the streak is rotated to align with the principal meridians.

### Calculation of Refractive Error
The power of the lens required to reach the neutralization point is the **Retinoscopy Value (RV)**. To get the final prescription, corrections must be made for the working distance and the tone of the ciliary muscle (if cycloplegic is used).

**Formula:**
$$Corrected \ Value = RV - Distance \ Correction - Cycloplegic \ Correction$$

**Correction Factors:**

| Factor | Correction Value (Deduction) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Distance (d)** | For 1 meter: **-1.0 D** <br> For 66 cm (2/3 m): **-1.5 D** |
| **Atropine** | **-1.0 D** |
| **Cyclopentolate** | **-0.75 D** |
| **Homatropine** | **-0.50 D** |

**Example:**
If neutralization is achieved with a +4.0 D lens at 1 meter using Atropine:
*   $RV = +4.0 D$
*   $Distance = -1.0 D$
*   $Atropine = -1.0 D$
*   **Result:** $+4.0 - 1.0 - 1.0 = +2.0 D$.

### Use of Cycloplegics
Cycloplegics paralyze the ciliary muscle (paralysis of accommodation) and dilate the pupil. This is essential in young children or hypermetropes with active accommodation.

**Drug Selection:**
*   **Atropine (1% Ointment):** Children < 5-7 years (Strongest, effect lasts 10-20 days).
*   **Cyclopentolate (1% Drops):** Children 8-20 years (Effect lasts 6-18 hours).
*   **Homatropine (2% Drops):** Hypermetropes 5-25 years (Effect lasts 48-72 hours).
*   **Tropicamide:** Adults (Mainly mydriatic, unreliable cycloplegic).

**Clinical Implications:**
*   **Atropine Toxicity:** Systemic absorption can occur. Ointment is preferred over drops in children to reduce toxicity risks.
*   **Phenylephrine:** Only a mydriatic, causes no cycloplegia. No deduction is needed for tone.

### Difficulties in Retinoscopy
*   **Scissoring Reflex:** Seen in irregular astigmatism or dilated pupils. Two bands of light move towards each other like scissors closing. Common in [[Keratoconus]].
*   **Triangular Shadow:** Reflex appears triangular with apex at the cone; swirls around the apex (Yawning reflex). Seen in **Keratoconus**.
*   **Dim Reflex:** Due to hazy media (cataract, corneal opacity) or very high refractive error.
*   **Conflicting Shadows:** Moving in various directions, seen in irregular astigmatism.
