# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Low Osmolarity ORS

# [[Low Osmolarity ORS]]

### 1. Introduction and Definition
[[Low Osmolarity ORS]] is the **current WHO/UNICEF recommended formulation** for the treatment of diarrheal dehydration. It replaced the older "Standard ORS" (which had a higher osmolarity of 311 mOsm/L) to prevent potential adverse effects of hypertonicity, such as osmotic diarrhea.

### 2. Composition and Osmolarity (Exam High Yield)
This is the most frequently asked table in exams. The total osmolarity is **245 mOsm/L**.

| Component (Ingredients) | Quantity (grams/liter) | Molar Concentration (mmol/liter) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sodium Chloride** (NaCl) | **2.6** | **Sodium**: 75 |
| **Glucose** (Anhydrous) | **13.5** | **Glucose**: 75 |
| **Potassium Chloride** (KCl) | **1.5** | **Potassium**: 20 |
| **Trisodium Citrate** (dihydrate) | **2.9** | **Citrate**: 10 |
| | | **Chloride**: 65 |
| **Total Weight** | **20.5 g** | **Total Osmolarity: 245** |

> *   **N**aCl: **2.6**
> *   **G**lucose: **13.5** (Half of 26 is 13... close enough!)
> *   **P**otassium: **1.5**
> *   **C**itrate: **2.9** (Close to 3)

> Remember **75 - 75 - 65** (Sodium, Glucose, Chloride are the big numbers).
> Remember **20 - 10** (Potassium, Citrate are the small numbers).

### 3. Physiological Basis (Mechanism of Action)
*   **Coupled Transport:** The absorption of sodium across the intestinal mucosa is significantly enhanced when given with glucose. This is the physiological basis of [[Oral Rehydration Therapy]].
*   **Water Absorption:** Water follows the sodium and glucose passively across the intestinal wall, correcting the fluid deficit.

### 4. Why "Low Osmolarity"? (Clinical Relevance)
The shift from the old standard ORS (311 mOsm/L) to the new Low Osmolarity ORS (245 mOsm/L) offers significant clinical advantages:
*   **Reduced Stool Output:** It reduces stool output by approximately **20%**.
*   **Reduced Vomiting:** Vomiting is reduced by about **30%**.
*   **Reduced IV Therapy:** It decreases the need for unscheduled supplemental [[Intravenous therapy]] by **33%**.
*   **Safety:** It avoids the risk of **hypernatremia** (high blood sodium) and is safe for both children with non-cholera diarrhea and patients with cholera.

### 5. Role of Citrate
Trisodium citrate replaced sodium bicarbonate in the older formula because:
1.  **Stability:** Citrate makes the ORS powder more stable (longer shelf-life), whereas bicarbonate reacts with glucose in damp conditions causing discoloration.
2.  **Correction of Acidosis:** Citrate corrects the metabolic acidosis associated with diarrhea.
3.  **Direct Effect:** Trisodium citrate has a direct effect on increasing intestinal absorption of sodium and water, reducing stool output.

### 6. Preparation and Administration Guidelines
*   **Preparation:** Dissolve the entire content of one packet in **one liter** of clean drinking water.
*   **Storage:** The solution must be made fresh daily. It should be kept covered and **used within 24 hours**. Any remaining solution after 24 hours must be discarded.
*   **Caution:** The solution should **not be boiled** after preparation.

### 7. Adjunct Therapy: Zinc Supplementation
Under the national program, [[Zinc]] is used as an adjunct to ORS:
*   **Dosage:** 
    *   Children > 6 months: **20 mg/day** for 14 days.
    *   Infants 2–6 months: **10 mg/day** for 14 days.
*   **Benefits:** Reduces the duration and severity of the current episode and reduces the incidence of diarrhea in the following 2–3 months.
