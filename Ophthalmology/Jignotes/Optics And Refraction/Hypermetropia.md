# Hypermetropia (Hyperopia)

### Definition
**[[Hypermetropia]]**, also known as long-sightedness, is the refractive state of the eye wherein parallel rays of light coming from infinity are focused **behind the retina** when the accommodation is at rest,. 
*   **Result:** The posterior focal point lies behind the retina, causing the retina to receive a blurred image.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a schematic eye where parallel light rays enter the cornea and lens, converging to a focal point located *behind* the retina. Show a convex lens placed in front of the eye converging the rays onto the retina to correct it.

### Optics
*   The eye is optically too weak or too short.
*   **Far Point:** Virtual and lies behind the eye.
*   **Near Point:** Recedes further away from the eye compared to an emmetropic eye.

### Etiology and Classification
Hypermetropia can be classified based on the mechanism of refractive error:

| Type | Mechanism | Clinical Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Axial Hypermetropia]]** | Shortening of the anteroposterior diameter (axial length) of the eye. | **Most Common Form.** <br> **1 mm shortening ≈ +3 Diopters (D) of hypermetropia**,. Seen in [[Microphthalmos]]. |
| **[[Curvatural Hypermetropia]]** | The curvature of the cornea or lens is flatter than normal. | **1 mm increase in radius of curvature ≈ +6 D**,. Seen in [[Cornea plana]]. |
| **[[Index Hypermetropia]]** | Decrease in the refractive index of the lens (cortical sclerosis) or aqueous. | Seen in old age (cortical sclerosis) and diabetics under treatment,. |
| **[[Positional Hypermetropia]]** | Posterior displacement of the crystalline lens. | Seen in trauma or congenital anomalies,. |
| **[[Aphakia]]** | Absence of the crystalline lens. | Produces high hypermetropia (approx +10D),. |

### Components of Hypermetropia
The interplay between the refractive error and the patient's ability to accommodate is crucial. 
**Total Hypermetropia = [[Latent Hypermetropia]] + [[Manifest Hypermetropia]]**,.

#### 1. Latent Hypermetropia
*   The portion of hypermetropia corrected by the normal physiological tone of the [[ciliary muscle]].
*   It is **only** revealed under complete cycloplegia (e.g., using [[Atropine]]).
*   High in children, decreases with age.

#### 2. Manifest Hypermetropia
*   The remaining portion not corrected by ciliary tone. It is measured by the strongest plus (convex) lens accepted by the patient for clear distance vision. It has two subtypes:
    *   **[[Facultative Hypermetropia]]:** The part that *can* be corrected by the patient's own voluntary accommodative effort,.
    *   **[[Absolute Hypermetropia]]:** The residual part that *cannot* be corrected by accommodation. This component causes defective vision,.

> **Clinical Implication:** In young age, nearly all hypermetropia is latent or facultative due to high accommodative power. As age advances and accommodation weakens (presbyopia), the latent becomes manifest, and the facultative becomes absolute.

### Clinical Features

#### Symptoms
Patients may be asymptomatic if the error is low and accommodation is good.
1.  **[[Asthenopia]] (Eye Strain):** Due to continuous excessive accommodation to maintain clear vision. Includes eye ache, frontal headache, heaviness of lids, and mild photophobia,.
2.  **Defective Vision:**
    *   Blurred vision, more for near than distance (unless the error is very high).
    *   **Premature [[Presbyopia]]:** Hypermetropes lose the ability to accommodate for near vision earlier than emmetropes.
3.  **Spasm of Accommodation:** Excessive accommodation can induce artificial myopia (pseudomyopia), leading to intermittent blurring of distant vision.

#### Signs
1.  **Eyeball:** Usually small; may look deep-set.
2.  **Cornea:** May be smaller than normal.
3.  **[[Anterior Chamber]]:** Shallower than normal (Risk factor for **[[Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma]]**),.
4.  **Fundus Examination:**
    *   **[[Pseudopapillitis]]:** The optic disc appears hyperemic with blurred margins (simulating papilledema) due to crowding of nerve fibers in a small eye. There is *no* venous engorgement or physiologic cup obliteration,.
    *   **[[Shot Silk Retina]]:** A shimmering reflex on the retina,.
5.  **A-Scan Ultrasonography:** Reveals short axial length.

### Complications
If left untreated, hypermetropia can lead to:
1.  **Recurrent Infections:** Styes ([[Hordeolum]]), [[Blepharitis]], or [[Chalazion]] due to constant rubbing of eyes.
2.  **Squint:** **[[Accommodative Convergent Squint]] (Esotropia)**. Due to the synkinetic reflex, excessive accommodation triggers excessive convergence,.
3.  **[[Amblyopia]]:**
    *   *Anisometropic Amblyopia:* In unilateral high hypermetropia.
    *   *Ametropic Amblyopia:* In bilateral uncorrected high hypermetropia.
4.  **Glaucoma:** Predisposition to Primary Narrow Angle Glaucoma due to anatomical crowding.

### Treatment

#### 1. Optical Correction (Non-Surgical)
*   **Spectacles:** **Convex (Plus) lenses** converge light rays on the retina.
    *   **Rule for Prescription:**
        *   *Children (with deviation/squint):* Full cycloplegic refraction correction should be given (deducting allowance for atropine tone).
        *   *Adults:* Manifest hypermetropia is corrected. Give the strongest convex lens with which the patient has maximum visual acuity (under-correction is often preferred initially to avoid blurring due to ciliary spasm),.
*   **[[Contact Lenses]]:** Useful for high hypermetropia or anisometropia.

#### 2. Surgical Correction ([[Refractive Surgery]])
*   **Cornea-based Procedures:**
    *   **[[Hyperopic LASIK]]:** For low to moderate hypermetropia (+1 to +4 D).
    *   **[[Conductive Keratoplasty]] (CK):** Radiofrequency energy shrinks peripheral collagen to steepen the central cornea.
    *   **Thermal Laser Keratoplasty (TLK):** Uses Holmium:YAG laser.
*   **Lens-based Procedures:**
    *   **[[Refractive Lens Exchange]] (RLE):** Removal of clear lens and implantation of IOL of appropriate power. Useful for high hypermetropia (> +4 D to +10 D).
    *   **Phakic IOL:** Implantable Collamer Lens (ICL) inserted in the posterior chamber.
