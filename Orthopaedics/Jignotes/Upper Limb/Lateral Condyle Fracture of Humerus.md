# [[Upper Limb]] > Lateral Condyle Fracture of Humerus

# Lateral Condyle Fracture of Humerus

### Introduction and Epidemiology
*   **Definition:** An intra-articular fracture involving the [[lateral condyle]] of the humerus, typically extending from the metaphysis into the joint surface (capitulo-trochlear groove).
*   **Incidence:** It is the **second most common** fracture around the elbow in children (after [[supracondylar fracture]]).
*   **Age Group:** Commonly seen in children aged **4–10 years**.
*   **Fracture Type:** It is a **Salter-Harris Type IV** [[physeal injury]] (transects the metaphysis, physis, and epiphysis).
*   **Nature:** It is termed a **"Fracture of Necessity"**, meaning it almost invariably requires surgical intervention for stabilization.

### Pathoanatomy
*   The lateral condyle consists of the [[capitulum]] and the lateral part of the [[trochlea]], along with the [[lateral epicondyle]].
*   **Anatomic Deformity:** The fracture line runs obliquely upwards and laterally from the intercondylar area.
*   **Displacement Forces:** The fragment is often displaced and rotated due to the pull of the **common extensor origin** muscles attached to the lateral epicondyle.

### Mechanism of Injury
1.  **Varus Force (Most Common):** Fall on an outstretched hand with the forearm supinated and a varus force applied to the elbow. The [[radial head]] drives into the [[capitulum]], shearing it off.
2.  **Pull-off Theory:** Avulsion force caused by the pull of the common extensor muscles attached to the lateral epicondyle during a fall.

### Classification (Milch Classification)
Based on the location of the fracture line relative to the **lateral trochlear ridge** (which is crucial for elbow stability).

| Type | Description | Stability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Milch Type I** | Fracture line passes **lateral** to the trochlear groove (through the capitulo-trochlear groove). | The elbow remains **stable** as the trochlea is intact. |
| **Milch Type II** | Fracture line passes **medial** to the trochlear groove (through the trochlea). | The elbow is **unstable** (radius and ulna can translocate laterally). This is more common. |

### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:** Pain and swelling over the lateral aspect of the elbow.
*   **Swelling:** Usually localized to the lateral side (unlike the diffuse swelling in [[supracondylar fracture]]).
*   **Tenderness:** Maximum over the lateral condyle.
*   **Crepitus:** May be present but should not be elicited forcefully.
*   **Three-point Bony Relationship:** The relationship between the medial epicondyle, lateral epicondyle, and olecranon is **disturbed** (distinguishing it from a supracondylar fracture where it is maintained).

### Imaging
*   **X-rays:** Anteroposterior (AP) and Lateral views of the elbow.
*   **Interpretation Challenge:** In young children, the [[capitulum]] may be largely cartilaginous. A seemingly small flake of bone seen on X-ray often represents a massive cartilaginous fragment.
*   **Oblique Views:** Often required to assess the true degree of displacement.

**Clinical Implication:** Do not underestimate the size of the fragment based on the small ossific nucleus seen on X-ray. The cartilaginous component is much larger.

### Treatment
The management depends on the degree of displacement.

#### 1. Undisplaced Fractures (< 2 mm displacement)
*   **Method:** Conservative management.
*   **Immobilization:** **Above-elbow cast** with the elbow flexed to 90° and forearm in supination (to relax extensor muscles).
*   **Duration:** 3–4 weeks.
*   **Monitoring:** Frequent X-rays (weekly) are mandatory to detect late displacement.

#### 2. Displaced Fractures (> 2 mm displacement)
*   **Standard of Care:** Surgery is mandatory.
*   **Closed Reduction:** Can be attempted for minor displacement, fixed with percutaneous [[Kirschner wires]] (K-wires).
*   **Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF):**
    *   **Indication:** Most displaced fractures, or if closed reduction fails.
    *   **Approach:** Lateral approach (Kocher's approach).
    *   **Fixation:** Two smooth K-wires or a screw.
    *   **Technique:** Anatomical reduction is essential to restore the articular surface and prevent physeal arrest. Avoid stripping posterior soft tissues to preserve vascular supply to the fragment.

### Complications
Lateral condyle fractures are notorious for complications if not managed correctly.

#### 1. Non-union
*   **Cause:**
    *   Constant pull of extensor muscles causing displacement.
    *   Fracture fragment is bathed in synovial fluid (which dissolves the fracture hematoma).
    *   Inadequate immobilization or fixation.
*   **Result:** Weak elbow, instability, and late valgus deformity.

#### 2. Malunion and Cubitus Valgus
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   If the fracture unites in a displaced position (proximal migration), or if there is growth arrest of the lateral physis due to injury.
    *   The medial condyle continues to grow while the lateral side lags behind.
    *   This leads to progressive **Valgus deformity** ([[Cubitus Valgus]]).
*   **Comparison:** Unlike supracondylar fractures which lead to *Cubitus Varus* (Gunstock), lateral condyle fractures lead to *Cubitus Valgus*.

#### 3. Tardy Ulnar Nerve Palsy
*   **Definition:** Delayed onset of [[ulnar nerve]] paralysis (years after injury).
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   The development of **Cubitus Valgus** stretches the ulnar nerve on the medial side.
    *   The nerve becomes tethered and functionally compromised.
*   **Symptoms:** Numbness/tingling in the ring and little fingers, wasting of hypothenar muscles, claw hand.
*   **Treatment:** Anterior transposition of the ulnar nerve.

#### 4. Growth Arrest (Fishtail Deformity)
*   Premature closure of the physis leads to a deformity of the distal humerus resembling a fish's tail ("Fishtail deformity"), leading to incongruity and stiffness.

#### 5. Lateral Condyle Overgrowth (Spur formation)
*   A prominence on the lateral aspect of the elbow may develop due to hyperemic overgrowth; usually cosmetic and asymptomatic.
