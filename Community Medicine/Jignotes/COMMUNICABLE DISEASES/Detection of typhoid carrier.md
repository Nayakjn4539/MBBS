# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Detection of typhoid carrier

# Detection of Typhoid Carrier

The detection of a [[Typhoid Carrier]] is a critical public health measure because carriers are the ultimate source of infection and are responsible for maintaining the endemicity of the disease (e.g., the famous case of "Typhoid Mary").

### 1. Classification of Carriers
Before detection, it is vital to understand *who* we are looking for. Carriers are persons who harbor the specific infectious agent ([[Salmonella typhi]]) without discernible clinical disease and serve as a potential source of infection.

*   **Incubatory Carriers:** Shed bacilli during the incubation period (transient).
*   **Convalescent Carriers:** Shed bacilli for **2 to 3 weeks** (up to 3 months) after recovery.
*   **Chronic Carriers:** Excrete bacilli for **more than one year** after a clinical attack.
    *   The organisms usually persist in the **[[Gallbladder]]** (biliary tract) or rarely the kidney.
    *   About **2–5%** of cases become chronic carriers.
    *   More common in **women** (female:male ratio 3:1) and those with **gallstones** or biliary abnormalities.

### 2. Methods of Detection

Detection involves identifying the presence of the organism or specific immunological markers.

#### A. Microbiological (Cultural) Examination
This is the **definitive method** for diagnosis.

*   **Stool Culture:**
    *   Primary method for detecting fecal carriers.
    *   Since shedding can be **intermittent**, a single negative result is *not* sufficient.
    *   **Protocol:** Repeated stool examinations (e.g., 3 consecutive samples) are required to rule out the carrier state.
    *   Chronic carriers may excrete $10^{11}$ organisms per gram of feces.
*   **Urine Culture:**
    *   Used to detect **[[Urinary carriers]]**.
    *   While less common than intestinal carriers, urinary carriers are **epidemiologically more dangerous**.
    *   Often associated with urinary tract abnormalities (e.g., Schistosomiasis, calculi).
*   **Duodenal Drainage/Aspirate:**
    *   Involves culturing bile-stained fluid aspirated from the duodenum.
    *   This establishes the presence of [[Salmonella]] in the **biliary tract** (the reservoir).

#### B. Serological Examination
Used primarily for **screening** purposes in epidemiological surveys (e.g., screening food handlers).

*   **Detection of [[Vi Antibodies]]:**
    *   The **Vi antigen** is associated with virulence.
    *   While H and O antibodies (detected by Widal test) are found in acute cases or vaccinated individuals, the **persistence of Vi antibodies** strongly suggests a carrier state.
    *   **Significance:** Vi antibodies are present in approximately **80%** of chronic carriers.
    *   *Note:* The standard Widal test is **not** reliable for detecting carriers.

### 3. Comparison of Diagnostic Modalities

| Feature | Cultural Examination (Stool/Urine) | Serological Examination (Vi) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type** | **Definitive/Confirmatory** | **Screening** |
| **Sensitivity** | High (if repeated samples taken) | Moderate |
| **Target** | Isolates the live bacteria | Detects host immune response |
| **Utility** | Confirming diagnosis and certifying cure | Identifying suspects (e.g., Food handlers) |

### 4. Criteria for Declaring "Non-Infective"
A typhoid patient or carrier is declared non-infective (cured of carrier state) only when:
*   **Three consecutive stool and urine cultures** are found negative.
*   These samples should be taken at **weekly intervals** after the course of treatment is completed.

---

### 5. Clinical Relevance & Management
*   **Food Handlers:** All food handlers should be screened using stool cultures and history taking. They must be suspended from work if found positive until declared non-infective.
*   **Treatment of Carriers:**
    *   **Medical:** Intensive course of [[Ampicillin]] or [[Amoxicillin]] (4–6 g/day) with Probenecid for **6 weeks**. [[Ciprofloxacin]] (750 mg BD) for 4 weeks is also highly effective.
    *   **Surgical:** **[[Cholecystectomy]]** (removal of gallbladder) combined with antibiotic therapy has a cure rate of up to **80%** for chronic carriers with gallstones.

### Mnemonic for Typhoid Carriers
**"Typhoid Mary Has Gallstones"**

*   **M** - **M**ore common in Females (Mary).
*   **H** - **H**ideout is the Gallbladder.
*   **G** - **G**allstones predispose to chronic state.

**Screening Mnemonic: "Vi for Victory"**
*   **Vi** antibodies are the victory key to screen carriers!
