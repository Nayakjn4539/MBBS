*   **Infrastructure:** It operates through:
    *   **Wellness Centres:** 417+ units across the country (329 Allopathic and 88 AYUSH).
    *   **Empanelled Hospitals:** Over 1403 hospitals (including Eye Care and Dental Clinics) and 272 Diagnostic Centres.
*   **Administration:** It is administered by the **Directorate General of Health Services ([[DGHS]])** under the **Ministry of Health and Family Welfare**.

### **Clinical Relevance**
*   **Referral System:** The CGHS functions on a strict referral system (except in emergencies). A patient must first visit the Dispensary/Wellness Centre. If the Medical Officer cannot manage the case, they refer the patient to a specialist or an empanelled hospital.
*   **Cashless Service:** For pensioners, the treatment at empanelled private hospitals is generally cashless (the hospital bills the CGHS directly), which significantly reduces the financial burden on the elderly.
