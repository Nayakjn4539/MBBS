# Complications of Sinusitis

Complications of [[rhinosinusitis]] occur when the infection spreads beyond the mucosal lining of the paranasal sinuses into the surrounding structures. While the incidence has decreased with antibiotics, these complications remain potentially life-threatening and require prompt diagnosis and aggressive management.

## Pathophysiology and Routes of Spread

Infection spreads from the sinuses to surrounding structures via three main pathways:

1.  **Direct Extension (Bony Erosion):** The virus or bacteria erode the thin bony walls separating the sinuses from the orbit or cranium (e.g., [[lamina papyracea]] of the ethmoid, posterior table of the frontal sinus).
2.  **Venous Thrombophlebitis:** The most common route for intracranial complications. The veins of the nasal mucosa communicate with the veins of the face, orbit, and intracranial cavity via the valveless **diploic veins of Breschet**. Septic thrombi can travel retrograde to the cavernous sinus or meninges.
3.  **Perineural/Perivascular:** Spread along the olfactory nerve sheaths through the cribriform plate.

## Classification of Complications

Complications are broadly classified based on the anatomical area involved:

1.  **Orbital** (Most common, 60–75%)
2.  **Intracranial** (15–20%)
3.  **Osseous/Bony** (5–10%)
4.  **Local/Descending**

### 1. Orbital Complications

Orbital complications are the most frequent, particularly in children. They most commonly arise from [[acute ethmoiditis]] due to the thin separation provided by the [[lamina papyracea]].

**Chandler’s Classification of Orbital Complications**

| Stage | Condition | Pathophysiology & Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I** | **Preseptal Cellulitis** | • Inflammation anterior to the [[orbital septum]].<br>• **Features:** Eyelid edema and erythema.<br>• **Key:** Normal vision and ocular movements. |
| **II** | **Orbital Cellulitis** | • Inflammation spreads *behind* the orbital septum into orbital tissues.<br>• **Features:** Chemosis (conjunctival edema), [[proptosis]], painful/restricted eye movements (ophthalmoplegia).<br>• Vision is usually preserved initially. |
| **III** | **Subperiosteal Abscess** | • Pus collects between the periorbita (periosteum) and the bony wall (usually medial wall).<br>• **Features:** Displacement of the globe (downward and lateral for ethmoid origin). Proptosis and chemosis are marked. |
| **IV** | **Orbital Abscess** | • Pus collects *within* the orbital fat/muscle cone.<br>• **Features:** Severe proptosis, complete ophthalmoplegia, and risk of severe visual loss due to optic nerve compression. |
| **V** | **Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis** | • Extension of infection posteriorly into the [[cavernous sinus]].<br>• **Features:** Bilateral involvement, cranial nerve palsies. |

**Clinical Implication:** Any child with sinus infection presenting with painful eye movements, proptosis, or double vision requires an urgent CT scan to rule out abscess formation.

### 2. Intracranial Complications

These are more common in adolescents and adults, often arising from [[frontal sinusitis]] or [[sphenoid sinusitis]].

#### A. Meningitis
*   **Definition:** Inflammation of the leptomeninges.
*   **Incidence:** Most common intracranial complication.
*   **Clinical Features:** Fever, headache, neck rigidity (nuchal rigidity), photophobia, positive [[Kernig’s sign]] and [[Brudzinski’s sign]].
*   **Diagnosis:** Lumbar puncture (after ruling out raised ICT).

#### B. Intracranial Abscesses
1.  **Subdural Empyema:** Collection of pus between the dura and arachnoid. It is a surgical emergency with high mortality. Features include rapid deterioration, seizures, and focal neurological deficits.
2.  **Extradural (Epidural) Abscess:** Collection of pus between the bone and dura. Often "silent" or presents with a dull headache or [[Pott's puffy tumor]].
3.  **Brain Abscess:** Most commonly in the **frontal lobe** (direct spread from frontal sinus). Can be silent in the early stages ("latent phase") before presenting with raised intracranial pressure signs.

#### C. Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis (CST)
*   **Pathology:** Thrombophlebitis spreads from the dangerous area of the face, ethmoid, or sphenoid sinuses via valveless ophthalmic veins to the [[cavernous sinus]].
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Abrupt onset with high spiking fever ("picket-fence fever") and chills.
    *   **Eye Signs:** Severe chemosis, proptosis, and eyelid edema. Crucially, symptoms become **bilateral** within 24–48 hours due to intercavernous sinuses.
    *   **Neurological:** Ophthalmoplegia due to involvement of CN III, IV, and VI. **CN VI (Abducens)** is usually affected first as it runs through the center of the sinus.
    *   Sensory loss in CN V1 and V2 distribution.

**Comparison: Orbital Cellulitis vs. Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis**

| Feature | Orbital Cellulitis | Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Onset** | Gradual | Abrupt, severe toxemia |
| **Laterality** | Unilateral | Starts unilateral, rapidly becomes **bilateral** |
| **Pupils** | Reactions usually normal | Dilated and fixed (late stage) |
| **Pain** | Painful eye movements | Deep retro-orbital pain |
| **Sensory Loss** | Absent | Present (CN V1, V2) |
| **Cranial Nerves** | III, IV, VI involved due to muscle inflammation | Specific palsies (VI first) |

### 3. Osseous (Bony) Complications

#### Osteomyelitis of the Frontal Bone
*   **Also known as:** [[Pott's Puffy Tumor]].
*   **Pathophysiology:** Infection spreads from the frontal sinus via the diploic veins (thrombophlebitis) to the marrow of the frontal bone.
*   **Clinical Appearance:** A soft, doughy, fluctuant, tender swelling on the forehead (subperiosteal abscess).
*   **Treatment:** Intravenous antibiotics and surgical drainage (trephination or osteoplastic flap) to remove sequestered bone.

#### Osteomyelitis of the Maxilla
*   Rare; primarily seen in infants/children due to the presence of spongy bone.
*   Can cause damage to tooth buds and facial asymmetry.

### 4. Local and Descending Complications

#### Mucocele and Pyocele
*   **Definition:** Chronic cystic expansion of a sinus due to obstruction of the ostium. Accumulation of sterile mucus leads to a **mucocele**; if infected, it becomes a **pyocele**.
*   **Sites:** Frontal (>70%) > Ethmoid > Maxillary > Sphenoid.
*   **Features:**
    *   Expansile mass causing bone erosion.
    *   **Frontal mucocele:** Displaces eye **downwards and outwards**.
    *   **Ethmoid mucocele:** Displaces eye **laterally and forwards**.
    *   Egg-shell crackling on palpation.

#### Descending Infections
*   **Otitis Media:** Infection spreads via the Eustachian tube.
*   **Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis:** Due to post-nasal drip.
*   **Laryngitis/Bronchitis:** Chronic aspiration of infected mucus.

### Management Principles

1.  **Medical:**
    *   **Admission:** Hospitalization is mandatory for orbital and intracranial complications.
    *   **Antibiotics:** High-dose IV broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., Ceftriaxone + Metronidazole/Clindamycin) capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier.
    *   **Nasal Decongestants:** To promote drainage.

2.  **Surgical:**
    *   **Indications:** Abscess formation, vision loss, lack of response to IV antibiotics for 24-48 hours.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   **FESS ([[Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery]]):** For drainage of subperiosteal abscesses and opening infected sinuses.
        *   **External Approaches:** Lynch-Howarth incision (for lateral orbital abscesses) or Frontal Trephination (for Pott's puffy tumor).
