# [[PRINCIPLES OF EPIDEMIOLOGY]] > Define epidemiology. Enlist the type of epidemiological studies. Briefly explain the merits and demerits of case control and cohort study design.

### Definition of Epidemiology

**Epidemiology** is defined by John M. Last as:
"The study of the **distribution** and **determinants** of **health-related states or events** in **specified populations**, and the **application** of this study to the **control of health problems**.",,,

**Key Components of the Definition:**
1.  **Frequency:** Measurement of disease (Rates, Ratios, Proportions).
2.  **Distribution:** Analysis by Time, Place, and Person [[Descriptive Epidemiology]].
3.  **Determinants:** Factors that influence health (Biological, Social, Cultural, Economic) [[Analytical Epidemiology]].
4.  **Health-related states:** Includes disease, disability, death, and physiological conditions (e.g., blood pressure).
5.  **Populations:** Focus is on groups, not individuals.
6.  **Application:** The ultimate goal is control and prevention.,

### Classification of Epidemiological Studies

Epidemiological studies are broadly classified into two main categories: **Observational** and **Experimental** studies.,,

> A flowchart showing the classification of epidemiological studies branching into Observational (Descriptive and Analytical) and Experimental

**I. Observational Studies** (Nature takes its course; investigator only measures)
*   **Descriptive Studies:** (Formulate Hypothesis)
    *   Case Reports / Case Series
    *   Cross-sectional studies (Prevalence studies)
    *   Ecological studies (Correlational studies)
*   **Analytical Studies:** (Test Hypothesis)
    *   [[Case-Control Study]] (Retrospective)
    *   [[Cohort Study]] (Prospective/Longitudinal)

**II. Experimental / Interventional Studies** (Investigator manipulates conditions)
*   **Randomized Controlled Trials** ([[RCT]]) (Clinical trials)
*   Field Trials
*   Community Trials

### Merits and Demerits of Case-Control and Cohort Studies

#### 1. Case-Control Study
*Also known as: Retrospective study, Trohoc study, Backward-looking study.*,

**Merits (Advantages):**
*   **Rapid and Inexpensive:** Relatively easy to carry out and requires less time and money compared to cohort studies.
*   **Rare Diseases:** It is the method of choice for investigating [[rare diseases]] or diseases with a long latency period.
*   **No Attrition:** There are no problems with loss to follow-up as the event has already occurred.
*   **Multiple Risk Factors:** Allows the study of several etiological factors for a single disease outcome simultaneously.
*   **Ethical Issues:** Minimal ethical problems compared to experimental studies.

**Demerits (Disadvantages):**
*   **Bias:** Highly prone to **Recall Bias** (patients remember past events better than controls) and **Selection Bias** (difficulty in selecting appropriate controls).,
*   **No Incidence:** Cannot measure incidence rates directly.
*   **Relative Risk:** Can only estimate the [[Odds Ratio]] (an approximation of Relative Risk), not the true Relative Risk.
*   **Rare Exposures:** Not suitable for rare exposures.
*   **Validation:** Validation of information obtained from history is often difficult or impossible.

#### 2. Cohort Study
*Also known as: Prospective study, Incidence study, Forward-looking study, Longitudinal study.*,

**Merits (Advantages):**
*   **Incidence:** It is the only observational study that provides a direct measure of [[Incidence Rate]].
*   **Relative Risk:** Provides a direct estimate of **Relative Risk (RR)** and **Attributable Risk (AR)**.
*   **Rare Exposures:** Suitable for studying rare exposures (e.g., nuclear radiation).
*   **Multiple Outcomes:** Can study multiple potential effects (diseases) of a single exposure.
*   **Temporal Association:** Establishes that the cause preceded the effect (Temporality), which is crucial for causal association.
*   **Bias:** Minimizes recall bias as exposure is assessed before the disease develops.

**Demerits (Disadvantages):**
*   **Expensive and Time-Consuming:** Requires a large sample size and long follow-up period (years to decades).
*   **Attrition:** **Loss to follow-up** (attrition bias) is a major problem; results are invalid if attrition is high.
*   **Rare Diseases:** Not suitable for investigating rare diseases (you would need a massive population to find a few cases).
*   **Hawthorne Effect:** The study itself may alter people's behavior (e.g., people stop smoking because they are being watched).
*   **Ethics:** Ethical problems may arise as evidence accumulates; investigators may be obliged to intervene.

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Case-Control Study | Cohort Study |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Direction** | Effect to Cause (Backward) | Cause to Effect (Forward) |
| **Starting Point** | Disease | Exposure (People free of disease) |
| **Cost/Time** | Inexpensive, Rapid | Expensive, Time-consuming |
| **Best for** | Rare **Diseases** | Rare **Exposures** |
| **Measurement** | Odds Ratio | Incidence, Relative Risk |
| **Major Bias** | Recall Bias | Attrition Bias |

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Case-Control:** When a doctor sees a patient with a rare condition (e.g., a specific cancer) and takes a detailed history to find out *why* it happened, they are essentially applying case-control thinking.
*   **Cohort:** When a doctor advises a patient that "Smoking will lead to heart disease in 10 years," they are basing this on evidence from cohort studies (like the Framingham Heart Study) that established the risk over time.

### Mnemonics
*   **Case-Control = "CRAP"**
    *   **C**heap
    *   **R**are diseases
    *   **A**voids attrition
    *   **P**rone to bias (Recall)
*   **Cohort = "CIPHER"**
    *   **C**ostly
    *   **I**ncidence measured
    *   **P**rospective
    *   **H**awthorne effect
    *   **E**xposures (Rare)
    *   **R**elative Risk
