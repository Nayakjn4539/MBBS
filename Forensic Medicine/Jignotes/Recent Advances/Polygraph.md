### Polygraph (Lie Detector)

**Definition**
A polygraph is an instrument used for the **Psychophysiological Detection of Deception (PDD)**. It continuously records sensitive physiological variables that change when a person voluntarily attempts to deceive the examiner.

**Principle**
The technique is based on the **Psychosomatic Theory**:
1.  When a person tells a lie, there is a fear of detection.
2.  This fear acts as a stressor, stimulating the **[[Sympathetic Nervous System]]**.
3.  This stimulation triggers the "Fight or Flight" response, causing involuntary physiological changes that can be measured.
4.  These changes occur because the [[Autonomic Nervous System]] is not under the conscious control of the subject.

**Physiological Parameters Recorded**
The standard polygraph records four main physiological changes using sensors attached to the subject:

| Parameter | Mechanism of Change | Sensor Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Respiration** | Breathing becomes irregular, slowed, or suppressed (erratic) | Pneumograph tubes (Thoracic & Abdominal) |
| **Blood Pressure** | Relative rise in BP due to vasoconstriction | Blood pressure cuff (Arm) |
| **Pulse** | Rate increases | Blood pressure cuff / Plethysmograph |
| **Electrodermal Response (EDR)** | Increased sweat gland activity lowers electrical resistance | Galvanic Skin Response ([[GSR]]) sensors on fingers |

*Note: Some modern devices may also record muscular movements to detect countermeasures.*

**Procedure**
The examination is conducted in a quiet, private room to minimize distractions. It consists of three phases:

**1. Pre-Test Interview**
*   **Informed Consent:** Written consent is mandatory (legal requirement).
*   **Rapport Building:** The examiner explains the procedure to reduce general nervousness.
*   **Question Formulation:** Questions are framed with the mutual consent of the subject. They must be answered with a simple **"Yes"** or **"No"**.

**2. Testing Phase**
The examiner asks a set of 10–12 questions, spaced 20–25 seconds apart. A chart is recorded for 3–4 minutes. The test is usually repeated 2–3 times to ensure consistency.
The questionnaire typically uses the **Control Question Technique (CQT)**, consisting of three types of questions:
*   **Irrelevant Questions:** Neutral facts (e.g., "Is your name John?", "Are you sitting down?"). Used to establish a baseline.
*   **Relevant Questions:** Directly related to the crime (e.g., "Did you kill Mr. X?").
*   **Control (Probable-Lie) Questions:** Vague questions designed to provoke anxiety in innocent people (e.g., "Have you ever stolen anything in your life?").

**3. Post-Test Interview**
*   The examiner analyzes the charts.
*   If deception is indicated, the subject is given an opportunity to explain the physiological responses.

**Interpretation**
*   **Truthful Subject:** Shows more physiological disturbance to **Control Questions** (fear of being judged on character) than to Relevant questions.
*   **Deceptive Subject:** Shows significantly higher physiological arousal (spikes in BP, GSR, etc.) to **Relevant Questions** (fear of detection) compared to Control questions.

**Medicolegal Aspects in India**
The legal standing of Polygraph, [[Narcoanalysis]], and Brain Mapping was settled by the Supreme Court of India in the landmark judgment: **Selvi & Ors vs. State of Karnataka (2010)**.

1.  **Right Against Self-Incrimination:** Compulsory administration of these tests violates **[[Article 20(3)]]** of the Constitution ("No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself").
2.  **Consent:** These tests cannot be conducted without the **voluntary consent** of the accused. The consent must be recorded before a Judicial Magistrate.
3.  **Admissibility:**
    *   The **test results** (the charts/graphs/opinion of the expert) are **NOT admissible** as substantive evidence in court.
    *   However, any **discovery of fact** made based on information obtained during the test (e.g., recovering a hidden weapon based on the subject's statement) **IS admissible** under **Section 27 of the [[Indian Evidence Act]]**.

**Limitations**
*   **False Positives:** An innocent person may appear deceptive due to extreme nervousness, fear, or anger.
*   **False Negatives:** Pathological liars ([[Psychopaths]]), trained agents, or persons under the influence of sedatives/tranquilizers may not show autonomic arousal while lying.
*   **Accuracy:** Generally cited between 80–90%, but scientific validity is debated.

**Mnemonic**
To remember the components and legal status: **"LIES"**
*   **L** - **L**egal status: Voluntary only (Selvi vs Karnataka).
*   **I** - **I**nstruments: BP cuff, Pneumograph, GSR.
*   **E** - **E**vidence: Not substantive (Section 27 IEA exception).
*   **S** - **S**ympathetic nervous system stimulation is the basis.
