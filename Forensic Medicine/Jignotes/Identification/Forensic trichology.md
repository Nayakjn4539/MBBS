# [[Forensic Trichology]]

Forensic trichology is the scientific study of hair, which is a vital [[trace evidence]] found at crime scenes. It is virtually indestructible (except by burning) and remains identifiable even on decomposed bodies.

### Anatomy of Hair
Hair consists of a root (bulb), a shaft, and a tip. The shaft is composed of three concentric layers:
1.  **Cuticle:** The outermost layer consisting of thin, non-pigmented, transparent scales.
2.  **Cortex:** The middle layer containing longitudinally arranged cells with pigment granules (melanin). It provides strength and color.
3.  **Medulla:** The innermost central core composed of cells, air bubbles, or pigment.

### Differentiation: Human vs. Animal Hair

The primary objective in forensic examination is to determine if the hair is of human or animal origin.

| Feature | Human Hair | Animal Hair |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **General Appearance** | Fine, thin, and soft. | Coarse, thick, and rough. |
| **Cuticle Scales** | Small, thin, short, and irregular. Margins are often flattened (**Imbricate pattern**). | Large, thick, and step-like or wavy projections. |
| **Cortex** | Thick and well-striated. **4 to 10 times** as broad as the medulla. | Thin. Rarely more than twice as broad as the medulla. |
| **Medulla** | Narrow. Can be fragmented, interrupted, or absent. | Wide and continuous. Very prominent. |
| **Pigment** | Evenly distributed (concentrated toward the periphery). | Mostly concentrated around the medulla (central). |
| **Precipitin Test** | Specific for Human protein. | Specific for the respective Animal. |
| **Medullary Index (MI)** | **< 0.3** (Less than 1/3rd). | **> 0.5** (More than 1/2). |

#### [[Medullary Index]] (MI)
This is the most critical metric for differentiation. It is the ratio of the diameter of the medulla to the diameter of the hair shaft.

$$ \text{Medullary Index} = \frac{\text{Diameter of Medulla}}{\text{Diameter of Hair Shaft}} $$

*   **Human:** Index is **< 0.3**
*   **Animal:** Index is **> 0.5**

> **Mnemonic for Medullary Index:** 
> **H**umans are **H**umble (take up less space, < 0.3). 
> **A**nimals are **A**mple (take up more space, > 0.5).

### Determination of Origin (Site)
Once confirmed as human, the hair is analyzed to determine the body part it originated from:

*   **Scalp Hair:** Long, soft, circular in cross-section, and tapers from root to tip.
*   **Pubic/Axillary Hair:** Short, stout, coarse, curly, and oval/kidney-shaped in cross-section. Often has frayed ends.
*   **Beard/Moustache:** Thickest, curved, and triangular in cross-section.
*   **Eyebrows/Eyelashes:** Short, stiff, thick, and taper abruptly to a point.
*   **Body (Lanugo) Hair:** Fine, short, soft, and usually non-medullated.

### Determination of Race
Hair morphology can provide presumptive evidence of race:
*   **Caucasoid (Aryans):** Fine, straight/wavy. Cross-section is **Oval/Elliptical**.
*   **Mongoloid (Asians):** Straight, coarse. Cross-section is **Round/Circular**.
*   **Negroid (Africans):** Short, kinky/woolly. Cross-section is **Flat/Reniform**.

### Determination of Sex
1.  **Nuclear Sexing:** Examination of the root sheath cells.
    *   **Females:** Presence of [[Barr bodies]] (Sex chromatin) in 20–80% of nuclei.
    *   **Males:** Barr bodies are generally absent (0–4%).
    *   *Note: This is not possible in decomposed bodies.*
2.  **Y-Chromosome Staining:** Using Quinacrine mustard, Y-chromosomes fluoresce in male hair roots.
3.  **[[DNA Profiling]]:** Mitochondrial DNA (from shaft) or Nuclear DNA (from root) can determine sex definitively.

### Determination of Age
*   **Fetus/Newborn:** Fine, non-pigmented, non-medullated (Lanugo).
*   **Adult:** Pigmented, medullated.
*   **Elderly:** Loss of pigment (Graying) and decrease in diameter. *Note: Dyeing of hair must be ruled out chemically.*

### Medicolegal Aspects & Autopsy Findings

1.  **Crime Scene Linkage:** Hair found at a crime scene (clutched in the victim's hand or on the weapon) can link a suspect to the victim or location (Locard’s Exchange Principle).
2.  **Nature of Violence:**
    *   **Forcibly Pulled:** The root bulb is large, irregular, and the root sheath is ruptured/irregular.
    *   **Fallen Naturally:** The root is atrophied, shrunken, and club-shaped (bulbous).
    *   **Cut:** The tip is blunt or clean-cut.
    *   **Crushed:** The tip is frayed or split (seen in blunt trauma).
    *   **Singed:** Presence of clubbing or vesicle formation at the tip indicates burns/close-range firearm discharge.
3.  **Sexual Assault:** Pubic hair combing is a standard procedure to recover loose hair from the assailant on the victim.
4.  **Chronic [[Poisoning]]:** Hair acts as a repository for heavy metals (Arsenic, Thallium, Lead) and drugs. Sectional analysis can provide a timeline of exposure (growth rate approx. **0.4 mm/day** or **1 cm/month**).
5.  **Identification:** In mass disasters or decomposed bodies where facial features are destroyed, hair color and texture aid in identification.
6.  **Bestiality:** Animal hair found on the accused's clothes or genitals may prove contact with animals.
