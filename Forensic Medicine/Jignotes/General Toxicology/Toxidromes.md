# [[General Toxicology]] > Toxidromes

### Definition
A **Toxidrome** (Toxic Syndrome) is a collection of signs and symptoms, along with results from specific investigations, that constitute a pattern characteristic of a specific class of poisons. Identifying a toxidrome is crucial in [[Clinical Toxicology]] for making a presumptive diagnosis and initiating empiric treatment, especially when the specific agent is unknown or the patient is comatose.

### Major Toxidromes

#### 1. Cholinergic Toxidrome
This is caused by an excess of acetylcholine at the receptor sites due to inhibition of the enzyme [[Acetylcholinesterase]].
*   **Common Agents:** [[Organophosphates]] (OPC), [[Carbamates]], Pilocarpine, certain mushrooms (Inocybe, Clitocybe).
*   **Mechanism:** Inhibition of Acetylcholinesterase leading to accumulation of Acetylcholine at Muscarinic and Nicotinic receptors.

**Clinical Features:**
*   **Muscarinic Effects (Acute Phase):**
    *   **Mnemonic:** **DUMEBELS** or **SLUDGE**.
        *   **D**iarrhea / Defecation
        *   **U**rination
        *   **M**iosis (Constricted pupils)
        *   **B**radycardia / Bronchorrhea / Bronchospasm
        *   **E**mesis
        *   **L**acrimation
        *   **S**alivation
*   **Nicotinic Effects:**
    *   Muscle fasciculations, cramping, weakness, and paralysis (can lead to respiratory failure).
    *   Tachycardia and Hypertension (due to sympathetic ganglia stimulation) may be seen initially before bradycardia sets in.
*   **CNS Effects:** Irritability, confusion, convulsions, coma.

#### 2. Anticholinergic Toxidrome
Caused by blockage of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
*   **Common Agents:** [[Datura stramonium]], [[Atropa belladonna]], [[Antihistamines]], [[Tricyclic Antidepressants]] (TCA), Phenothiazines.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Mnemonic: The 8 D's**
        1.  **D**ryness of mouth (thirst)
        2.  **D**ysphagia
        3.  **D**ilated pupils ([[Mydriasis]])
        4.  **D**ry, hot skin
        5.  **D**runken gait (Ataxia)
        6.  **D**elirium (Muttering type)
        7.  **D**rowsiness
        8.  **D**eath (due to respiratory failure)
    *   *Funny Mnemonic:* "Blind as a bat (mydriasis), Mad as a hatter (delirium), Red as a beet (flushing), Hot as a hare (hyperthermia), Dry as a bone (anhidrosis)."

#### 3. Opioid / Narcotic Toxidrome
*   **Common Agents:** [[Morphine]], [[Heroin]], Codeine, Methadone, Pentazocine.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Classic Triad:**
        1.  **Coma** (Stupor/Unconsciousness)
        2.  **Pinpoint Pupils** (Miosis)
        3.  **Respiratory Depression** (Slow, shallow breathing <12/min).
    *   Other signs: Hypotension, hypothermia, bradycardia, pulmonary edema (froth at mouth/nostrils).
*   **Note:** In early stages/withdrawal, pupils may be dilated. Pethidine poisoning may show dilated pupils.

#### 4. Sympathomimetic Toxidrome
Caused by excessive stimulation of the adrenergic system (excess catecholamines).
*   **Common Agents:** [[Cocaine]], [[Amphetamines]], Methamphetamine, Ephedrine.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **CNS:** Agitation, excitement, hallucinations, delusions, seizures.
    *   **CVS:** Tachycardia, Hypertension, Arrhythmias.
    *   **Eye:** Mydriasis (Dilated pupils).
    *   **Skin:** **Diaphoresis (Sweating)** and Hyperthermia.
    *   *Distinguishing Factor:* Sympathomimetics cause **sweating**, whereas Anticholinergics cause **dry skin**.

#### 5. Sedative-Hypnotic Toxidrome
*   **Common Agents:** [[Barbiturates]], [[Benzodiazepines]], Ethanol, Chloral Hydrate.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Depression of Central Nervous System (CNS).
    *   Drowsiness, lethargy, ataxia (drunken gait), slurred speech.
    *   Coma, respiratory depression, hypotension.
    *   **Pupils:** Usually normal size or slightly contracted but reactive to light. May dilate in terminal asphyxia.
    *   *Cutaneous:* Barbiturate blisters (bullae) may be seen at pressure points.

#### 6. Hallucinogenic Toxidrome
*   **Common Agents:** [[LSD]], [[Cannabis]], Phencyclidine (PCP), Mescaline.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Perceptual alterations: Illusions, Hallucinations (Visual/Auditory), Synesthesia (seeing sounds/hearing colors).
    *   Depersonalization, derealization.
    *   Disorientation, confusion, agitation, panic attacks.
    *   Cannabis specifically causes conjunctival congestion and increased appetite.

### Summary Table of Common Toxidromes

| Toxidrome | Pupils | Skin | Bowel Sounds | Other Signs | Common Agents |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cholinergic** | **Miosis** (Pinpoint) | Wet / Sweaty | Hyperactive | Bradycardia, Bronchorrhea, Salivation, Fasciculations | Organophosphates, Carbamates |
| **Anticholinergic** | **Mydriasis** (Dilated) | **Dry**, Hot, Red | Hypoactive / Absent | Tachycardia, Urinary retention, Delirium | Datura, Atropine, Antihistamines |
| **Sympathomimetic**| **Mydriasis** (Dilated) | **Sweaty** (Diaphoresis) | Hyperactive | Tachycardia, Hypertension, Agitation | Cocaine, Amphetamines |

### Diagnostic Odors (Olfactory Clues)
Identifying specific odors from the mouth or during autopsy (opening cranial cavity) aids diagnosis.

*   **Bitter Almonds:** [[Cyanide]].
*   **Garlic:** [[Arsenic]], [[Phosphorus]], [[Organophosphates]], [[Aluminum Phosphide]].
*   **Fruity / Sweet:** [[Ethanol]], Chloroform, Acetone (Diabetic ketoacidosis).
*   **Rotten Eggs:** [[Hydrogen Sulfide]].
*   **Shoe Polish / Bitter:** Nitrobenzene.
*   **Kerosene / Petrol:** Organophosphates (due to solvent), Kerosene.
*   **Burnt Rope:** [[Cannabis]].
*   **Acrid / Pungent:** Chloral hydrate, Paraldehyde.

### Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Diagnosis:** Recognition of a toxidrome allows for rapid administration of specific antidotes (e.g., Atropine for Cholinergic, Naloxone for Opioid) even before lab confirmation, which is life-saving.
*   **Investigation:** Helps narrowing down the search for the Investigating Officer (IO) regarding the source of poison (e.g., farm pesticides vs. prescription drugs vs. illicit drugs).
*   **Autopsy:** The pathologist must look for signs matching the toxidrome (e.g., froth in airways for opioids/OPC, specific odors) to guide sample preservation.
