# [[Upper Limb]] > Scaphoid Fracture

# [[Scaphoid Fracture]]

### Introduction and Significance
The [[scaphoid bone]] (formerly known as the navicular) is the most commonly fractured bone of the [[carpus]], accounting for nearly 75% of all carpal fractures. It links the proximal and distal carpal rows and is mechanically crucial for wrist stability. Its unique retrograde blood supply makes it highly susceptible to complications like [[avascular necrosis]] (AVN) and [[non-union]].

### Mechanism of Injury
*   **Most Common:** Fall on an outstretched hand (FOOSH) with the wrist extended.
*   **Specific Mechanics:**
    *   **Radial compression and dorsiflexion:** Usually results in an **undisplaced fracture**.
    *   **Hyperextension:** Usually results in a **displaced fracture**.
*   **Demographics:** Common in young adults; rare in children and the elderly.

### Clinical Features
Patients often mistake this injury for a simple sprain because symptoms may not be severe initially.
*   **Pain and Swelling:** Localized to the radial side of the wrist.
*   **Tenderness:**
    *   **[[Anatomical Snuffbox]] Tenderness:** This is a cardinal sign.
    *   **Scaphoid Tubercle Tenderness:** Palpated volarly.
*   **[[Scaphoid Compression Test]]:** Pain produced by axial loading of the thumb.
*   **Painful Movement:** Limitation of wrist and thumb movements.

### Classification
Fractures are classified based on the anatomical location of the break:

| Fracture Location | Incidence/Risk | Prognosis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Scaphoid Tubercle]]** | Rare | Benign; good blood supply. |
| **Distal Pole** | Less common | Good healing potential. |
| **Waist** | **Most Common** | Moderate risk of non-union/AVN. |
| **Proximal Pole** | Less common | **Highest risk of AVN** due to poor blood supply. |

**Russe Classification (based on fracture line orientation):**
*   **Horizontal Oblique:** Stable (undisplaced).
*   **Transverse:** Stable (undisplaced).
*   **Vertical Oblique:** Unstable (shear forces prevent healing).

### Investigations
#### 1. Plain X-rays
Standard views may miss the fracture. Specific "Scaphoid views" are required:
*   **Posteroanterior (PA) View with Ulnar Deviation:** This elongates the scaphoid and brings it into profile, making the fracture line more visible.
*   **Lateral View.**
*   **Oblique View:** Often the best view for visualization.
*   **Ziter's View:** Modified PA view.

#### 2. Management of "Occult Fractures"
If clinical signs suggest a fracture (snuffbox tenderness) but initial X-rays are negative:
*   **Clinical Implication:** Do **NOT** dismiss as a sprain.
*   **Protocol:** Immobilize the wrist in a [[scaphoid cast]] (glass-holding position) for 2 weeks.
*   **Follow-up:** Repeat X-rays after 2 weeks. Resorption of bone at the fracture line may make it visible.
*   **Advanced Imaging:** If doubt persists, **[[MRI]]** is the gold standard for early diagnosis. CT scans are useful to assess union or displacement.

### Treatment

#### Conservative Management
Indicated for **undisplaced fractures** and stable fractures.
*   **Immobilization:** Application of a **Scaphoid Cast** (Glass holding position).
*   **Position:** Wrist in **15° dorsiflexion** and **5° radial deviation**.
    *   *Reasoning:* This position relaxes the fracture site by neutralizing the tension forces, unlike the ulnar deviation used for X-ray diagnosis.
*   **Duration:** Typically 6–12 weeks depending on healing signs. 95% union rate expected within 10 weeks.

#### Operative Management
Indicated for:
*   **Displaced fractures** (>1mm step or gap).
*   **Unstable fractures** (Vertical oblique).
*   **Proximal pole fractures** (due to high AVN risk).
*   **Delayed diagnosis** or non-union.
*   **Method:** Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF) or Percutaneous fixation using a **[[Herbert Screw]]** (a headless differential pitch screw that provides compression) or Acutrak screw.

### Complications

#### 1. [[Avascular Necrosis]] (AVN)
*   **Pathophysiology:** The blood supply to the scaphoid enters distally and flows proximally (retrograde flow). A fracture at the waist can interrupt blood flow to the **proximal fragment**, leading to bone death.
*   **Incidence:** Up to 40% in proximal pole fractures.
*   **Radiographic Sign:** The proximal pole appears denser (sclerotic) than the surrounding bone on X-ray.
*   **Clinical Sign:** Hawkins sign (subchondral lucency) indicates *viable* bone; its absence may suggest necrosis.
*   **Treatment:** Revascularization procedures or excision of the necrotic fragment.

#### 2. [[Non-union]]
*   **Causes:** Missed diagnosis, inadequate immobilization, or unstable fracture type.
*   **Features:** Persistent pain, cyst formation, and sclerotic margins at the fracture site.
*   **Treatment:** Rigid internal fixation with **bone grafting** (e.g., Matti-Russe graft or vascularized bone graft).

#### 3. Carpal Instability
*   Can lead to collapse of the carpal architecture, specifically **[[DISI]]** (Dorsal Intercalated Segment Instability).

#### 4. Secondary Osteoarthritis
*   Non-union and AVN can lead to **[[SNAC wrist]]** (Scaphoid Non-union Advanced Collapse), eventually requiring wrist arthrodesis or salvage procedures.
