# Visual Perception Mechanisms in Strabismus

In a person with [[Strabismus]] (squint), the visual axes of the two eyes are misaligned. Consequently, the images of an object do not fall on corresponding retinal points (the [[Fovea]] of both eyes). If this occurs in an adult with mature visual pathways, it results in double vision. However, in children or individuals with long-standing squint, the brain utilizes specific **Sensory Adaptations** and **Motor Adaptations** to maintain functional vision and avoid distressing visual symptoms like [[Diplopia]] and [[Confusion]].

## I. The Immediate Visual Consequences (The Problem)
Before adaptation occurs, or in acute adult cases, misalignment causes two primary visual disturbances:

### 1. Diplopia (Double Vision)
*   **Mechanism:** The image of the object of regard falls on the [[Fovea]] of the fixing eye and a **non-corresponding point** on the [[Retina]] of the deviating eye.
*   **Result:** The patient sees two images of the same object.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Uncrossed (Homonymous) Diplopia:** Seen in [[Esotropia]] (Convergent squint). The false image is on the same side as the deviating eye.
    *   **Crossed (Heteronymous) Diplopia:** Seen in [[Exotropia]] (Divergent squint). The false image is seen on the opposite side.

### 2. Confusion
*   **Mechanism:** Two *different* objects are imaged on **corresponding points** (the foveae) of the two eyes. The fixing eye looks at Object A, while the deviating eye's fovea looks at Object B.
*   **Result:** The brain perceives two different objects superimposed at the same location in space.

## II. Sensory Adaptations (How the Brain Adjusts)
To tolerate the misalignment and avoid diplopia and confusion, the visual cortex develops sensory adaptations. These are most effective if the squint develops during the critical period of visual development (birth to 6-8 years).

### 1. Suppression
*   **Definition:** This is a temporary, active cortical inhibition of the visual image formed on the retina of the squinting eye.
*   **Mechanism:** The brain essentially "ignores" the input from the deviating eye to prevent [[Diplopia]] and [[Confusion]].
*   **Types:**
    *   **Facultative Suppression:** Occurs only when both eyes are open (binocular vision). If the fixing eye is covered, the deviating eye takes up fixation.
    *   **Alternating Suppression:** Seen in alternating squint; the patient suppresses the image from whichever eye is deviating at that moment.
*   **Scotoma:** In esotropia, suppression usually involves the fovea and the peripheral retina where the image of the object of regard falls, leading to a suppression [[Scotoma]].

### 2. Amblyopia (Lazy Eye)
*   **Definition:** A developmental defect of spatial visual processing. It is a unilateral or bilateral subnormal vision (visual acuity < 6/9 or 2-line difference) without ophthalmoscopic abnormalities.
*   **Pathophysiology:** Continuous, prolonged active suppression of the deviating eye leads to permanent lowering of vision.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Crowding Phenomenon:** Single letters are read better than a row of letters.
    *   **Neutral Density Filter Effect:** Visual acuity does not drop significantly (or may improve) through a dark filter, unlike in organic disease where it drops markedly.

### 3. Abnormal Retinal Correspondence (ARC)
*   **Definition:** A condition where the fovea of the normal fixing eye and an **extra-foveal point** on the retina of the squinting eye acquire a common visual direction.
*   **Function:** This creates a new, non-physiological "pairing" of retinal points to allow for a crude form of [[Binocular Single Vision]] despite the deviation.
*   **Consequence:** The patient may demonstrate binocular vision on testing (e.g., [[Bagolini Striated Glasses]]) despite having a manifest squint.

### 4. Eccentric Fixation
*   **Definition:** In long-standing unilateral squint, the deviating eye loses the power to fixate with the fovea. Even when the good eye is covered, the bad eye uses an extra-foveal (eccentric) point for fixation.
*   **Clinical Implication:** This represents a severe form of sensory adaptation and is often associated with deep amblyopia.

## III. Motor Adaptations
### Compensatory Head Posture (CHP)
In cases of **Incomitant Squint** (Paralytic or Restrictive), the patient adopts a specific head position to maintain binocular single vision and avoid diplopia.

*   **Mechanism:** The patient turns their face/head in the direction of the action of the paralyzed muscle. This places the eyes in a field of gaze where the muscle's action is not required, thereby aligning the visual axes.
*   **Components:**
    *   **Head Turn (Face Turn):** To compensate for horizontal deviation (e.g., Face turn to right in Right [[Lateral Rectus]] palsy).
    *   **Chin Lift/Depression:** To compensate for vertical deviation.
    *   **Head Tilt:** To compensate for torsional deviation (e.g., Head tilt to the opposite shoulder in [[Superior Oblique]] palsy).

## Summary of Visual Status in Squint

| Condition | Visual Status (How they see) | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Acute Squint (Adult)** | **Diplopia** | Image falls on non-corresponding retinal points. |
| **Suppression** | **Single Vision** (Monocular) | Cortical inhibition of the deviating eye's image. |
| **Amblyopia** | **Blurred Vision** (in one eye) | Consequence of prolonged suppression/disuse. |
| **ARC** | **Single Vision** (Binocular) | Brain pairs fovea of good eye with non-fovea of bad eye. |
| **Compensated Phoria** | **Binocular Single Vision** | Fusional reserves keep eyes aligned (Latent squint). |
| **Paralytic Squint** | **Single Vision** (with Head Posture) | Head moves to align visual axes and avoid diplopia. |
