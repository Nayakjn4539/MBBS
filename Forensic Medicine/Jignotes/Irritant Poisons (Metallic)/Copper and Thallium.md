# [[Irritant Poisons (Metallic)]] > Copper and Thallium

### **COPPER**

Copper is an essential trace element, but its salts are powerful irritants. Metallic copper is non-poisonous, but its salts are toxic.

#### **Common Compounds**
1.  **Copper Sulfate** ([[Blue Vitriol]]/Neela Thotha): Crystalline blue salt. Most common.
2.  **Copper Subacetate** (Verdigris/Zangal): Greenish salt formed on copper vessels when acted upon by vegetable acids (food contamination).

#### **Mechanism of Action**
*   **Local:** Powerful irritant to the GI mucosa.
*   **Systemic:**
    *   Inhibits **Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G-6-PD)**.
    *   Causes intravascular [[haemolysis]] leading to hemoglobinuria and kidney damage.
    *   Directly toxic to capillaries, liver, and kidneys.

#### **Clinical Features (Acute Poisoning)**
**1. Gastrointestinal Phase (15–30 mins)**
*   **Taste:** Metallic, astringent taste.
*   **Vomiting:** Copious. The vomitus is characteristically **Blue or Greenish-blue**. (Diagnostic feature).
    *   *Note:* If the color turns deep blue on adding ammonium hydroxide, it confirms copper.
*   **Pain:** Severe burning pain in the stomach, colic, and bloody diarrhea (tenesmus).

**2. Systemic Phase (1–2 days later)**
*   **Haemolysis:** Massive intravascular hemolysis leads to [[hemoglobinuria]] (coffee-colored urine).
*   **Jaundice:** Hematogenous jaundice due to hemolysis and direct hepatotoxicity.
*   **Renal Failure:** Oliguria, albuminuria, and uremia due to tubular necrosis (blocked by hemoglobin casts).
*   **Musculoskeletal:** Painful muscle cramps and spasms.
*   **CNS:** Headache, lethargy, convulsions, coma.

#### **Chronic Poisoning**
Usually occupational (copper smelting, welding).
*   **Green Line:** On the gums (purple/red line in copper workers).
*   Metallic taste, colic, loss of appetite.
*   **Copper Dust:** Can cause discoloration of hair and teeth (Greenish).
*   **[[Chalcosis Lentis]]:** Sunflower cataract (deposition of copper in the lens).

#### **Fatal Dose and Period**
*   **Fatal Dose:** 15–30 gm (Copper Sulfate).
*   **Fatal Period:** 1–3 days.

#### **Treatment**
1.  **Stabilization:** ABC guidelines.
2.  **[[Stomach Wash]]:**
    *   **Specific Agent:** **1% Potassium Ferrocyanide**.
    *   *Action:* It converts toxic copper sulfate into **Cupric Ferrocyanide** (insoluble reddish-brown precipitate).
    *   *Note:* Stomach wash should be done continuously until the return fluid is clear (no longer blue).
3.  **Demulcents:** Egg white (forms albuminate of copper) or milk.
4.  **Chelation:**
    *   **D-Penicillamine:** Drug of choice (oral).
    *   **BAL (Dimercaprol):** Deep IM injection.
    *   **Calcium Disodium EDTA.**
5.  **Supportive:**
    *   IV fluids for shock.
    *   Sodium bicarbonate to alkalize urine (prevents hemoglobin crystallization in renal tubules).
    *   **[[Hemodialysis]]**: Highly effective in renal failure.

#### **Autopsy Findings**
*   **Mucosa:** The mucous membrane of the stomach and small intestine is congested, inflamed, and may show **greenish-blue discolouration**.
*   **Liver:** Soft, fatty, and yellow (fatty degeneration/necrosis).
*   **Kidneys:** Congested; tubules blocked by hemoglobin casts.
*   **Heart:** Subendocardial hemorrhages.

#### **Medico-Legal Aspects**
*   **Suicide:** Common in India due to easy availability (agriculture/industry).
*   **Accidental:** Common in children (eating crystals thinking they are sweets) or accidental food contamination (Verdigris).
*   **Homicide:** Rare due to color and metallic taste.

### **THALLIUM**

Historically known as the **"Poisoner’s Poison"** because it is tasteless, odorless, and colorless. Formerly used as a rodenticide and depilatory agent (for ringworm).

#### **Clinical Features**
Thallium poisoning often presents as a triad (The **Thallium Triad**):
1.  **Gastroenteritis**
2.  **Peripheral Neuropathy** (Painful)
3.  **[[Alopecia]]**

**1. Acute Poisoning (12–24 hours)**
*   Severe abdominal pain, bloody vomiting, and diarrhea.
*   **Neurology:** Painful [[peripheral neuropathy]] (burning feet syndrome), paresthesia, muscle weakness, convulsions, delirium, and coma.
*   **Cardiovascular:** Tachycardia and hypertension.

**2. Chronic/Sub-acute Poisoning**
*   **Alopecia:** The most characteristic sign. Hair loss begins 10–14 days after exposure. It spares the medial 1/3rd of eyebrows and axillary/facial hair (sometimes).
*   **Mees' Lines:** Transverse white bands on nails (also seen in Arsenic).
*   **Skin:** Dry, scaly, acne-like rash; **Thallotoxicosis** (glossitis, stomatitis).
*   **Neurological:** Ataxia, chorea, dementia, tremors.

#### **Fatal Dose and Period**
*   **Fatal Dose:** ~1 gram.
*   **Fatal Period:** 24–36 hours (Acute); Weeks (Chronic).

#### **Treatment**
1.  **Decontamination:** [[Gastric lavage]].
2.  **Specific Antidote:** **Prussian Blue** (Potassium Ferric Cyanoferrate).
    *   *Dose:* 250 mg/kg/day orally via duodenal tube.
    *   *Mechanism:* It exchanges potassium for thallium in the crystal lattice, preventing reabsorption from the gut (interrupts enterohepatic circulation).
3.  **Activated Charcoal:** Useful in repeated doses.
4.  **Forced Diuresis:** With Potassium Chloride (KCl) – *Note: Use with caution as it may transiently worsen symptoms by mobilizing thallium from tissues.*
5.  **Hemodialysis:** Effective if done early.

#### **Autopsy Findings**
*   **External:** **Alopecia** (if survival >2 weeks), skin rashes, emaciation.
*   **Internal:**
    *   Fatty degeneration of the liver, heart, and kidneys.
    *   Gastrointestinal inflammation.
    *   **Thallium resists putrefaction** and can be detected in the ashes of a cremated body (similar to Arsenic).

#### **Medico-Legal Aspects**
*   **Homicidal:** Ideal agent in the past due to lack of taste/smell and delayed symptoms.
*   **Accidental:** Consumption of rat poisons (though banned in many countries now).
