# Cases and Carriers of Diphtheria

Diphtheria is an acute infectious disease caused by the toxigenic strains of **[[Corynebacterium diphtheriae]]**. Epidemiologically, the source of infection plays a vital role in transmission, involving both clinical cases and asymptomatic carriers.

### 1. Source of Infection
The reservoir of infection for diphtheria is exclusively **human**. The source may be a **Case** or a **Carrier**.

### 2. Cases
Cases range from subclinical (inapparent) infections to frank clinical disease.

*   **Clinical Spectrum:**
    *   **Mild/Subclinical Cases:** These patients may exhibit only minor symptoms like a running nose or sore throat. Epidemiologically, they are **more important** than severe cases because they remain **ambulant** (mobile) and actively spread the infection in the community.
    *   **Frank Clinical Cases:** These present with the classical signs of the disease. Based on the site of infection, they are classified as:
        *   **Anterior Nasal:** Mildest form but highly infectious due to frequent shedding.
        *   **Faucial (Pharyngotonsillitis):** Most common type; characterized by the formation of a **[[Pseudomembrane]]** (greyish-yellow, tough, adherent) over tonsils.
        *   **Laryngeal:** Severe form; can lead to airway obstruction.
        *   **Cutaneous:** Secondary infection of skin lesions/ulcers.

*   **Period of Infectivity:**
    *   Usually **14 to 28 days** from the onset of the disease if untreated.
    *   Infectivity ceases rapidly (within 24 hours) after starting specific antibiotic therapy.

### 3. Carriers
Carriers are asymptomatic persons who harbor the specific infectious agent (*C. diphtheriae*) and serve as a potential source of infection.

*   **Significance:**
    *   Carriers are the **most common source of infection** for diphtheria.
    *   It is estimated that **95%** of the total disease transmission is caused by carriers rather than clinical cases.
    *   For every clinical case, there may be **20 carriers** in the community.

*   **Types of Carriers:**
    1.  **Based on Site:**
        *   **Nasal Carriers:** These are the **most dangerous** epidemiologically. They shed large numbers of bacilli into the environment through nasal discharge.
        *   **Throat Carriers:** Less infectious compared to nasal carriers.
    2.  **Based on Duration:**
        *   **Temporary Carriers:** The carrier state usually lasts for about **one month**.
        *   **Chronic Carriers:** The state persists for a year or longer. This is rare and often associated with chronic pathology like infected tonsils.

> **Clinical Relevance:** **Immunization does NOT prevent the carrier state.** Diphtheria toxoid protects against the *toxin* (disease) but not against the colonization by the *bacteria*. Therefore, immunized individuals can still become carriers and transmit the disease to susceptible (unimmunized) individuals.

### 4. Diagnosis and Screening
*   **Swabs:** Diagnosis of cases and detection of carriers is done by culturing swabs taken from both the **nose and throat**.
*   **Criteria for Non-Communicability:** A case or carrier is considered non-infectious only when **at least two consecutive cultures**, taken 24 hours apart, are negative.

### 5. Management and Control

| Feature | Cases | Carriers |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Isolation** | Isolate immediately (preferably in hospital) for at least 14 days or until declared non-infectious. | Identify and treat to eliminate the organism. |
| **Treatment** | **Diphtheria Antitoxin (DAT):** Neutralizes unbound toxin (20k-100k units).<br>**Antibiotics:** Penicillin or Erythromycin to clear the bacteria. | **Erythromycin:** Oral course for 10 days is the treatment of choice to eradicate the carrier state. |
| **Contacts** | Search for cases/carriers among contacts. Prophylactic antibiotics and immunization boosters for close contacts. | Treat carriers to prevent community spread. |

### 6. Mnemonic for Carriers
**"Nasal is Notorious"**
*   **N**asal carriers are **N**otorious because they shed more bacilli and are the most dangerous source of infection compared to throat carriers.
