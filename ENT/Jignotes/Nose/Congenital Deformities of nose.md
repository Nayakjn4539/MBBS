# [[Nose]] > Congenital Deformities of nose

### Congenital Deformities of the Nose

Congenital anomalies of the nose and paranasal sinuses are rare conditions resulting from the failure of fusion of various embryological processes or failure of recanalization of primitive membranes during fetal development (specifically the 2nd month of fetal life).

---

### 1. Choanal Atresia
This is the most common congenital anomaly of the nose (Incidence 1:7000 births). It is the persistence of the **nasobuccal membrane of Hochstetter**, leading to the blockage of the posterior nasal aperture (choana).

#### Types
*   **Anatomic:**
    *   **Bony:** 30% (Traditionally thought to be 90%, but CT studies show mixed is common).
    *   **Membranous:** 30%.
    *   **Mixed (Bony + Membranous):** 70%.
*   **Laterality:**
    *   **Unilateral:** More common (2:1). Often undiagnosed until adulthood.
    *   **Bilateral:** Life-threatening emergency in neonates.

#### Clinical Features
*   **Bilateral [[Choanal Atresia]]:**
    *   **Neonates are obligate nasal breathers** (up to 3-5 months) because the high position of the larynx allows simultaneous suckling and breathing.
    *   **Cyclical Cyanosis/Asphyxia:** The baby is cyanotic and struggles to breathe when quiet/sleeping/feeding (mouth closed). When the baby cries, they breathe through the mouth, and cyanosis disappears ("Blue when quiet, Pink when crying").
    *   Feeding difficulty: Choking and regurgitation during feeds.
*   **Unilateral Choanal Atresia:**
    *   Usually asymptomatic at birth.
    *   Presents in childhood with **unilateral persistent mucoid nasal discharge** (glue-like) and unilatral nasal obstruction.

#### Diagnosis
1.  **Clinical:** Failure to pass a size 6-8 Fr suction catheter from the nose into the pharynx.
2.  **Cold Spatula Test:** Mist formation on a cold metal spatula held below the nostril is absent on the affected side.
3.  **Methylene Blue Dye:** Instilled in the nose; does not appear in the pharynx.
4.  **Flexible Nasal Endoscopy:** Direct visualization of the atretic plate.
5.  **CT Scan (Gold Standard):** Non-contrast CT (Axial view) confirms the type (bony/membranous) and thickness of the atretic plate. > [!warning] Diagram Alert

#### Associated Syndrome: [[CHARGE Syndrome]]
*   **C** - **C**oloboma of the eye.
*   **H** - **H**eart defects (Tetralogy of Fallot).
*   **A** - **A**tresia of Choanae.
*   **R** - **R**etarded growth/development.
*   **G** - **G**enital hypoplasia.
*   **E** - **E**ar anomalies/deafness.

#### Management
*   **Emergency (Bilateral):** Establish oral airway.
    *   **McGovern’s Technique:** An oral airway or a feeding nipple with a large hole is strapped in the mouth to maintain an oral airway.
    *   Intubation or [[Tracheostomy]] may be needed if the oral airway fails.
*   **Surgical Correction:**
    *   **Transnasal Endoscopic Repair:** Current treatment of choice. The atretic plate is punctured/drilled, and the opening is enlarged.
    *   **Transpalatal Approach:** Historically used, offers better exposure but higher morbidity.
    *   **Mitomycin-C:** Applied topically to prevent restenosis (scarring).
    *   **Stenting:** Often required for weeks to maintain patency.

### 2. Congenital Midline Nasal Masses
These present as swellings on the dorsum of the nose or intranasally. They occur due to faulty separation of neuroectoderm from the surface ectoderm.
*   **Clinical Warning:** **NEVER biopsy a pediatric nasal mass** without imaging (CT/MRI) to rule out intracranial extension. Biopsy of an encephalocele can lead to CSF leak and [[Meningitis]].

#### A. [[Nasal Dermoid]] (Nasal Dermoid Sinus Cyst)
*   **Pathology:** Ectodermal inclusion cyst containing skin elements (hair follicles, sebaceous glands).
*   **Location:** Anywhere from the glabella to the columella.
*   **Presentation:**
    *   Midline pit or sinus opening on the nasal dorsum.
    *   **Pathognomonic:** Intermittent discharge of sebaceous material or a **tuft of hair** protruding from the pit.
    *   Recurrent infection/abscess.
*   **Complication:** Deep tracts may extend intracranially through the foramen cecum.
*   **Treatment:** Surgical excision (may require combined neurosurgical approach if intracranial extension exists).

#### B. [[Nasal Glioma]]
*   **Pathology:** Heterotopic/dysplastic brain tissue (glial cells) that has been "nipped off" from the brain.
*   **Connection:** Usually has a fibrous stalk connected to the brain but **no fluid connection** to the subarachnoid space (No CSF).
*   **Presentation:**
    *   Firm, non-compressible mass.
    *   Reddish/bluish swelling on the bridge of the nose (60% extranasal) or inside the nasal cavity (30% intranasal).
    *   **Furstenberg Test Negative:** Does not expand on crying or jugular vein compression.
*   **Treatment:** Surgical excision.

#### C. [[Encephalocele]] (Meningoencephalocele)
*   **Pathology:** Herniation of brain tissue and meninges through a skull base defect (usually cribriform plate or foramen cecum).
*   **Presentation:**
    *   Soft, bluish, pulsatile mass.
    *   Located at the root of the nose (Nasofrontal), side of the nose (Nasoethmoidal), or inside the nose (simulating a polyp).
    *   **Furstenberg Test Positive:** Mass increases in size/pulsates when the child cries, coughs, or on compression of the Internal Jugular Vein.
    *   Widening of the nasal bridge (**Hypertelorism**).
*   **Diagnosis:** MRI is essential to confirm continuity with the brain.
*   **Treatment:** Neurosurgical repair of the skull base defect.

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Consistency** | Cystic / Doughy | Firm | Soft / Cystic |

| **Compressibility** | No | No | **Yes** |
| **Furstenberg Test** | Negative | Negative | **Positive** |
| **Transillumination**| Negative | Negative | **Positive** |
| **External Sign** | Pit/Sinus with hair | Reddish mass | Bluish mass |
| **Content** | Sebaceous/Hair | Glial tissue | Brain/CSF |

### 3. Pyriform Aperture Stenosis
*   **Definition:** Congenital bony narrowing of the anterior nasal opening (pyriform aperture).
*   **Presentation:** Similar to choanal atresia (respiratory distress, cyclic cyanosis) but the obstruction is anterior.
*   **Clinical Signs:**
    *   Impossible to pass a catheter into the anterior nose (nostril).
    *   **Single Central Mega-Incisor:** Present in 60% of cases (indicates midline developmental defect).
*   **Diagnosis:** CT Scan showing bony overgrowth of the maxilla.
*   **Treatment:** Surgical drilling of the bony aperture.

---

### 4. Bifid Nose (Doggy Nose)
*   **Pathology:** Failure of fusion of the paired medial nasal processes.
*   **Appearance:** A vertical groove or cleft in the midline of the nasal tip/dorsum.
*   **Spectrum:** Ranges from a minor groove to complete separation of nostrils.
*   **Association:** Hypertelorism (widely spaced eyes).

---

### 5. Proboscis Lateralis
*   **Appearance:** A trunk-like tubular appendage located on the side of the nose or medial canthus.
*   **Pathology:** Developmental failure of the lateral nasal process.
*   **Significance:** Usually associated with unilateral absence of the nose on the affected side.

---

### 6. Congenital Atresia of Anterior Nares
*   Rare condition due to failure of canalization of the epithelial plug in the nostril.
*   Can be membranous or bony.
*   Treatment: Excision of the web/stenosis + stenting.
