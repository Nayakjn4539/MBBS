# Physiology of Hearing

Hearing involves the reception of sound waves by the ear, the conversion of these mechanical vibrations into electrical impulses (transduction), and the transmission of these impulses to the [[Auditory Cortex]] for interpretation.

The process is broadly divided into three stages:
1.  **Mechanical Conduction:** Transmission through [[External Ear]] and [[Middle Ear]].
2.  **Transduction:** Conversion of mechanical energy to electrical impulses in the [[Cochlea]].
3.  **Neural Transmission:** Conduction via the [[Auditory Nerve]] to the brain.

### 1. Mechanical Conduction of Sound

#### A. Role of External Ear
*   **Pinna (Auricle):** Collects sound waves (like a funnel) and helps in localization. It concentrates sound at the entrance of the [[External Auditory Canal]].
*   **External Auditory Canal (EAC):** Conducts sound to the [[Tympanic Membrane]].
    *   **Resonance:** The EAC acts as a resonator tube. Its natural resonance frequency is **3000 Hz** (adding 10–12 dB gain). This is why noise-induced hearing loss often affects the 4000 Hz region first (acoustic dip).

#### B. Role of Middle Ear (Impedance Matching)
When sound travels from a gaseous medium (air in the middle ear) to a liquid medium ([[Perilymph]] in the cochlea), 99.9% of sound energy is reflected. This resistance is called **Impedance**. To prevent this ~30 dB loss, the middle ear acts as an **Acoustic Transformer**.

**Mechanisms of Transformer Action:**

| Mechanism | Description | Ratio/Gain |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Areal Ratio (Hydraulic Action)** | The effective vibratory area of the [[Tympanic Membrane]] (~55 mm²) is much larger than the area of the [[Stapes Footplate]] (3.2 mm²). Force applied over a large area is concentrated onto a small area, increasing pressure. | **14:1 to 17:1** |
| **Ossicular Lever Action** | The [[Handle of Malleus]] is 1.3 times longer than the [[Long Process of Incus]]. This creates a mechanical advantage of a Class 1 lever. | **1.3:1** |
| **Catenary/Curved Membrane Effect** | The [[Tympanic Membrane]] is rigidly attached at the annulus but curved. Movements are greater at the periphery than at the [[Umbo]], providing increased force. | 2x Gain |
| **Total Transformer Ratio** | Product of Areal Ratio × Lever Ratio ($17 \times 1.3$). | **22:1 (~25–33 dB)** |

**Phase Difference (Baffle Effect):**
*   Sound waves reach the [[Oval Window]] via ossicles before they reach the [[Round Window]] via air.
*   This phase differential ensures that when the oval window moves *in* (compression), the round window bulges *out* (rarefaction).
*   If sound hit both windows simultaneously, fluids would not move, causing significant hearing loss (approx. 60 dB loss in [[Ossicular Discontinuity]] with intact TM).

### 2. Transduction of Sound (Inner Ear Physiology)

The conversion of mechanical energy into electrical nerve impulses occurs in the [[Organ of Corti]] within the [[Scala Media]].

**Steps of Transduction:**
1.  **Stapes Movement:** [[Stapes Footplate]] moves in and out of the [[Oval Window]].
2.  **Fluid Wave:** This creates a traveling wave in the [[Perilymph]] of the [[Scala Vestibuli]], which passes to the [[Scala Tympani]] via the [[Helicotrema]].
3.  **Basilar Membrane Displacement:** The pressure difference moves the [[Basilar Membrane]] and the [[Organ of Corti]] sitting upon it.
4.  **Shearing Force:** As the basilar membrane moves up and down, a shearing force is generated between the [[Reticular Lamina]] and the [[Tectorial Membrane]].
5.  **Stereocilia Bending:** The [[Stereocilia]] of the [[Hair Cells]] are bent.
    *   Bending **towards the Kinocilium** (or basal body) $\rightarrow$ Opening of mechanically gated $K^+$ channels $\rightarrow$ Influx of $K^+$ from [[Endolymph]] $\rightarrow$ **Depolarization**.
    *   Bending **away** $\rightarrow$ Hyperpolarization.
6.  **Neurotransmitter Release:** Depolarization opens Voltage-gated $Ca^{2+}$ channels $\rightarrow$ release of **Glutamate** (neurotransmitter).
7.  **Action Potential:** Generation of nerve impulse in the afferent nerve fibers of the [[Spiral Ganglion]].

**Cochlear Potentials:**
*   **Endocochlear Potential:** Resting potential of **+80 mV** in the [[Scala Media]], generated by the [[Stria Vascularis]] (active transport of $K^+$). This acts as a battery for transduction.
*   **Cochlear Microphonics:** AC potential generated by [[Outer Hair Cells]] (OHC). It mimics the waveform of the sound stimulus.
*   **Summating Potential:** DC potential generated by [[Inner Hair Cells]]. Useful in diagnosing [[Meniere’s Disease]] (SP/AP ratio > 0.45).

**Function of Hair Cells:**
*   **Inner Hair Cells (IHC):** Primary sensory receptors (afferent). Transmit sound to the brain.
*   **Outer Hair Cells (OHC):** Cochlear amplifier. They possess electromotility (can shorten/lengthen via protein **Prestin**), enhancing sensitivity and frequency selectivity. Source of [[Otoacoustic Emissions]] (OAE).

### 3. Theories of Hearing

Various theories explain how the ear distinguishes different pitches (frequency analysis).

#### A. Helmholtz’s Place Theory (Resonance Theory) - 1883
*   **Concept:** The [[Basilar Membrane]] consists of a series of tuned resonators (like piano strings).
*   **Mechanism:** Specific places on the membrane resonate at specific frequencies.
    *   **Base:** Resonates to **High Frequencies** (short, stiff fibers).
    *   **Apex:** Resonates to **Low Frequencies** (long, flaccid fibers).
*   **Limitation:** Could not fully explain perception of complex sounds.

#### B. Rutherford’s Frequency (Telephone) Theory - 1886
*   **Concept:** The entire [[Basilar Membrane]] vibrates like a telephone diaphragm.
*   **Mechanism:** The [[Auditory Nerve]] fires at a rate matching the frequency of the sound (e.g., 100 Hz sound = 100 nerve impulses/sec).
*   **Limitation:** Neurons have a refractory period and cannot fire faster than 1000 Hz, yet we hear up to 20,000 Hz.

#### C. Wever’s Volley Resonance Theory - 1949
*   **Concept:** Combines Place and Frequency theories.
    *   **Low Frequencies (< 1000 Hz):** Coded by frequency of nerve firing (Frequency theory).
    *   **Intermediate Frequencies (1000–5000 Hz):** Coded by the **Volley Principle**. Groups of neurons fire in turns (volleys) to match the high frequency (like a relay team).
    *   **High Frequencies (> 5000 Hz):** Coded by the place of stimulation (Place theory).

#### D. Von Békésy’s Traveling Wave Theory - 1960 (Nobel Prize)
*   **Concept:** Currently accepted theory. Sound creates a wave that travels from the base to the apex of the [[Cochlea]].
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   The wave amplitude increases until it reaches a maximum peak at a specific point on the [[Basilar Membrane]], then dies out quickly.
    *   **High Frequencies:** Peak near the **Base**.
    *   **Low Frequencies:** Peak near the **Apex**.
    *   This passive mechanical tuning is sharpened by the active mechanism of [[Outer Hair Cells]].

### 4. Neural Pathway (Auditory Pathway)

The pathway from the cochlea to the brainstem and cortex. Information from both ears is represented bilaterally.

**Mnemonic: E COLI MA**
1.  **E**ight Nerve ([[Cochlear Nerve]]): Spiral ganglion axons.
2.  **C**ochlear Nucleus: Dorsal and Ventral (in Medulla/Pons). *First relay station.*
3.  **O**livary Complex ([[Superior Olivary Complex]]): In Pons. Responsible for **Sound Localization** and stapedial reflex. First place where binaural interaction occurs via [[Trapezoid Body]].
4.  **L**ateral Lemniscus: Major ascending tract.
5.  **I**nferior Colliculus: In Midbrain. Center for auditory reflexes.
6.  **M**edial Geniculate Body: In Thalamus. Final relay station.
7.  **A**uditory Cortex: **Brodmann Area 41** (Superior Temporal Gyrus). Conscious perception of sound.

### 5. Bone Conduction
Sound energy bypasses the middle ear and stimulates the cochlea directly through the skull bones.
*   **Inertial Bone Conduction:** Skull vibrates, but ossicles lag due to inertia, causing stapes movement. (Mainly low frequencies).
*   **Compressional Bone Conduction:** Vibration compresses the cochlear shell, moving fluids.
*   **Osseotympanic:** Vibration of canal wall radiates sound into the canal.

**Clinical Implication:** In [[Conductive Hearing Loss]], bone conduction remains normal (or enhanced due to occlusion effect), but air conduction is reduced (Negative Rinne).

### Clinical Highlights
*   **Carhart’s Notch:** A dip in Bone Conduction at **2000 Hz** seen in [[Otosclerosis]]. It disappears after successful stapedectomy.
*   **Recruitment:** Abnormal growth of loudness (quiet sounds not heard, loud sounds painful). Hallmark of **Cochlear Pathology** (e.g., [[Meniere’s Disease]]).
*   **Acoustic Dip (Boiler's Notch):** Dip in hearing at **4000 Hz** seen in early [[Noise Induced Hearing Loss]] due to acoustic resonance of the EAC.
*   **Tone Decay:** Abnormal auditory fatigue (nerve stops firing despite continuous sound). Hallmark of **Retrocochlear Pathology** (e.g., [[Acoustic Neuroma]]).
