# [[Preventive Medicine In Obstetrics, Paediatrics And Geriatrics]] > High Risk Pregnancy

### High Risk Pregnancy

**Definition**
A [[High Risk Pregnancy]] is defined as one in which the mother, the fetus, or the newborn is at an increased risk of morbidity or mortality before, during, or after delivery compared to a normal pregnancy. The central purpose of antenatal care is to identify these cases as early as possible and arrange for skilled care.

**The "Risk Approach"**
This is a managerial tool for improved MCH (Maternal and Child Health) care. Its motto is: *"Something for all, but more for those in need — in proportion to the need."* While essential care is provided to all, skilled care is concentrated on those identified as high risk.

**Prevalence**
While 10–20% of pregnancies belong to the high-risk category, they are responsible for significantly high proportion (often more than 50%) of perinatal mortalities and morbidities.

### Classification of Risk Factors
Risk factors are often multifactorial and can be biological, medical, or social.

#### 1. Demographic and Biological Factors
*   **Elderly Primi:** Age 30 years and over.
*   **Short Stature Primi:** Height [[140 cm]] and below (risk of contracted pelvis/CPD).
*   **Young Mothers:** Below 18 or 19 years (teenage pregnancy).
*   **Grand Multipara:** Elderly women with 5+ previous births (High parity).

#### 2. Obstetric History (Bad Obstetric History - BOH)
*   History of [[Stillbirth]] or intrauterine death.
*   History of previous Caesarean section or instrumental delivery.
*   History of manual removal of placenta (risk of adherent placenta/PPH).
*   History of 3 or more consecutive spontaneous abortions (Habitual abortion).

#### 3. Current Pregnancy Complications
*   **Malpresentations:** Breech, transverse lie, shoulder presentation.
*   **Hemorrhage:** [[Antepartum Hemorrhage]] (Placenta Previa/Abruptio Placentae) or threatened abortion.
*   **Hypertensive Disorders:** [[Pre-eclampsia]] and Eclampsia.
*   **Multiple Gestation:** Twins or triplets (higher risk of LBW and preterm labor).
*   **Amniotic Fluid Disorders:** Hydramnios (Polyhydramnios) or Oligohydramnios.
*   **Prolonged Pregnancy:** Pregnancy exceeding 14 days after Expected Date of Delivery (EDD).

#### 4. Associated Medical Conditions
*   **Anaemia:** Hb < 11 g/dl (Severe risk if Hb < 7 g/dl).
*   **Systemic Diseases:** Cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, [[Diabetes Mellitus]] (Gestational or Pre-existing), Tuberculosis, Liver disease (Jaundice/Hepatitis).
*   **Infections:** Malaria, HIV, Syphilis, TORCH infections.

### Mnemonic for High Risk Factors
To remember the major indications for referral: **"H-RISKS"**

*   **H** - **H**istory bad (Previous CS, stillbirth, PPH) / **H**ypertension (PIH/Eclampsia)
*   **R** - **R**h incompatibility / **R**eproductive age extremes (<18 or >30 Primi)
*   **I** - **I**nfections (HIV, Malaria, Hepatitis) / **I**ron deficiency (Severe Anemia)
*   **S** - **S**hort Stature (<140 cm) / **S**ugar (Diabetes)
*   **K** - **K**idney or Cardiac disease
*   **S** - **S**tructural issues (Malpresentation, Twins, Hydramnios)

### Screening and Diagnosis
Screening is an integral part of Antenatal Care (ANC).

**1. History Taking:**
*   Confirm pregnancy and LMP (Last Menstrual Period).
*   Detailed history of previous pregnancies (complications, mode of delivery, outcome).
*   Family history of hypertension, diabetes, or twins.

**2. Physical Examination:**
*   **Weight:** Excessive gain (>3 kg/month) suggests pre-eclampsia/twins; Low gain suggests IUGR.
*   **Blood Pressure:** BP $\ge$ 140/90 mmHg suggests hypertensive disorders.
*   **Pallor:** To detect anemia.
*   **Oedema:** Generalized swelling suggests pre-eclampsia.

**3. Abdominal Examination:**
*   Check fundal height (discrepancy with dates suggests IUGR, Twins, or Hydramnios).
*   Check fetal lie and presentation.

**4. Laboratory Investigations (Minimum):**
*   Hemoglobin estimation.
*   Urine test for Albumin and Sugar.
*   Blood grouping and Rh typing.
*   Screening for Syphilis (VDRL/RPR), HIV, HBsAg, and Malaria.

### Management Strategy

**1. Early Detection:**
Utilize the **"Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan" ([[PMSMA]])**:
*   Fixed day ANC services on the **9th of every month**.
*   **Color Coding System** for pregnancies:
    *   **Red Sticker:** [[High Risk Pregnancy]].
    *   **Blue Sticker:** Pregnancy Induced Hypertension (PIH).
    *   **Yellow Sticker:** Co-morbid conditions (Diabetes, Hypothyroidism, STIs).
    *   **Green Sticker:** No risk factor detected (Normal).

**2. Referral Services:**
*   Refer high-risk cases to **First Referral Units (FRUs)** or District Hospitals equipped with specialists and blood storage facilities.
*   Ensure **Skilled Birth Attendance**; high-risk mothers should **not** deliver at home or sub-centers.

**3. Specific Interventions:**
*   **Anemia:** Therapeutic doses of Iron and Folic Acid (IFA); parenteral iron or blood transfusion for severe cases.
*   **Hypertension:** Regular BP monitoring, Calcium supplementation, Methyldopa/Labetalol if required.
*   **Rh Negative:** Administration of Anti-D Immunoglobulin at 28 weeks and post-delivery.
*   **Nutrition:** Supplementary nutrition via Anganwadi centers (ICDS).

**4. Social Support:**
*   Utilize schemes like **Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY)** and **Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK)** to ensure free transport, drugs, diet, and diagnostics (zero expense delivery).

### Clinical Relevance
Failure to identify a high-risk pregnancy is a leading cause of preventable **Maternal Mortality** (due to hemorrhage, sepsis, eclampsia) and **Perinatal Mortality** (due to asphyxia, prematurity). The "At Risk" concept shifts the focus from rigid routine care to individualized, need-based care.
