# Trauma to the External Ear

Trauma to the [[external ear]] encompasses injuries to the [[pinna]] (auricle), the [[external auditory canal]] (EAC), and the [[tympanic membrane]] (TM). Injuries can arise from mechanical force (blunt or sharp), thermal changes, or chemical agents.

## 1. Trauma to the Auricle (Pinna)

The [[pinna]] is composed of elastic cartilage covered by perichondrium and thin skin. The skin on the lateral surface is tightly adherent to the perichondrium, while it is looser on the medial surface.

### A. Haematoma Auris (Otohematoma)
This is a collection of blood between the auricular cartilage and the [[perichondrium]].

*   **Etiology:**
    *   **Blunt Trauma:** Commonly seen in contact sports like boxing, wrestling, or rugby (shearing force separates cartilage from perichondrium).
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   The auricular cartilage has no direct blood supply; it depends on diffusion from the overlying perichondrium.
    *   A hematoma acts as a barrier, depriving the cartilage of nutrients.
    *   **Result:** [[Avascular necrosis]] of cartilage and infection.
    *   **Sequelae:** If untreated, the organized hematoma and neocartilage formation lead to a deformed, shriveled ear known as **[[Cauliflower Ear]]** (Boxer's Ear/Pugilist's Ear).
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Tender, tense, fluctuant, bluish/red swelling on the pinna.
    *   Usually involves the scaphoid fossa or helix.
*   **Management:**
    1.  **Aspiration:** Under strict aseptic conditions (for small/fresh hematomas).
    2.  **Incision and Drainage (I&D):** For larger or organized hematomas. An incision is made parallel to the helix.
    3.  **Prevention of Recurrence:**
        *   **Pressure Dressing:** To approximate the perichondrium back to the cartilage.
        *   **Contour Dressing:** Packing concavities with dental rolls or wet cotton.
        *   **Buttoning:** Through-and-through mattress sutures or buttons stitched on both sides.
    4.  **Antibiotics:** To prevent [[perichondritis]] and abscess formation.

### B. Lacerations
*   **Causes:** Sharp objects, bites (human/animal), road traffic accidents.
*   **Management:**
    *   Early repair is crucial.
    *   **Perichondrium:** Must be sutured with absorbable sutures (e.g., Vicryl) to cover the cartilage.
    *   **Skin:** Closed with fine non-absorbable sutures.
    *   **Caution:** Do not strip perichondrium from cartilage to avoid necrosis.
    *   **Antibiotics:** Mandatory, especially for bite injuries.

### C. Avulsion of Pinna
*   **Partial Avulsion:** If a pedicle remains, primary reattachment is usually successful due to rich blood supply.
*   **Complete Avulsion:**
    *   **Microvascular Re-implantation:** Ideal if feasible.
    *   **Banking:** The cartilage of the avulsed segment can be denuded of skin and buried (banked) in a post-auricular skin pocket for later reconstruction.

### D. Frostbite
Exposure to extreme cold causes formation of ice crystals and vasoconstriction, leading to tissue necrosis.

*   **Clinical Features:** Erythema, edema, bullae formation, and necrosis (tip of helix is most susceptible).
*   **Management:**
    *   **Rapid Rewarming:** Use moist cotton pledgets at **38–42°C**.
    *   **Analgesics:** Rewarming is very painful.
    *   **Avoid Debridement:** Surgical removal of tissue should be delayed for months ("Freeze in winter, operate in summer") until the line of demarcation is clear.

### E. Keloid
*   **Cause:** Trauma, burns, or ear piercing.
*   **Sites:** Lobule or helix.
*   **Treatment:** Surgical excision combined with intralesional steroids or post-operative radiation to prevent recurrence.

## 2. Trauma to the External Auditory Canal (EAC)

The [[external auditory canal]] consists of an outer cartilaginous part (1/3) and an inner bony part (2/3).

### Types of Trauma

| Type | Cause/Mechanism | Clinical Features | Management |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Minor Trauma** | Q-tips, matchsticks, scratching (cleaning ear). | Pain, bleeding, abrasion. | Keep dry; antibiotic drops if infected. |
| **Major Laceration** | Gunshot wounds, fractures. Condyle of [[mandible]] may impact anterior canal wall. | Stenosis, bleeding, deformities. | Surgical repair (meatoplasty), stenting to prevent stenosis. |
| **Temporal Bone Fracture** | **Longitudinal Fracture:** Blow to temporal/parietal region. | Step deformity in bony canal, bleeding, CSF otorrhea, [[haemotympanum]]. | Conservative; treat CSF leak; surgical reduction if stenosis occurs. |
| **Chemical/Thermal** | Hot fluids, button batteries. | [[Liquefactive necrosis]] (batteries), burns. | **Emergency:** Immediate removal of battery; remove debris. |

### Foreign Bodies
*   **Methods of Injury:** Trauma often occurs during unskilled attempts at removal.
*   **Types:** Animate (insects) or Inanimate (beads, seeds).
*   **Management:**
    *   **Living Insects:** Drown with oil/lidocaine first, then remove.
    *   **Vegetable Matter:** **Do NOT syringe** (swells up); remove with hooks/forceps.
    *   **General Rule:** Syringing is contraindicated if TM perforation is suspected.

## 3. Traumatic Tympanic Membrane Perforation

Trauma to the [[tympanic membrane]] (TM) often accompanies external ear trauma.

### Etiology
1.  **Direct Trauma:** Instrumentation (Q-tips, hairpins), foreign bodies, welding sparks.
2.  **Indirect Trauma:**
    *   **Acoustic/Blast Injury:** Sudden pressure wave (explosions, slap on the ear).
    *   **Barotrauma:** Flying, diving (descent), forceful Valsalva.
    *   **Fractures:** Longitudinal [[temporal bone fractures]].

### Clinical Features
*   Sudden severe [[otalgia]].
*   Hearing loss (Conductive, usually <40-50 dB).
*   [[Tinnitus]].
*   Bleeding from the ear (bloody otorrhea).
*   [[Vertigo]] (suggests inner ear injury/stapes subluxation).

### Examination Findings (Otoscopy)
*   Perforation margins are irregular and ragged (unlike chronic perforations which are smooth).
*   Fresh blood clot in the canal.
*   Edges may be inverted (pushed in) or everted (sucked out).

### Management
*   **Principle:** Most traumatic perforations heal spontaneously (80% within 3-10 weeks).
*   **Medical (Conservative):**
    *   **Keep Ear Dry:** Avoid water entry (cotton with Vaseline while bathing).
    *   **Avoid Eardrops:** Unless there is active infection/contamination.
    *   **Avoid Nose Blowing:** Prevents middle ear pressure changes.
    *   Systemic antibiotics if infection risk is high.
*   **Surgical:**
    *   **Early:** if severe vertigo/facial palsy suggests ossicular disruption (Requires exploration).
    *   **Delayed:** If perforation persists > 3 months, **[[Myringoplasty]]** is indicated.
    *   **Paper Patch:** Can be used to align edges and accelerate healing.

**Clinical Implication:** A persistent conductive hearing loss after the TM has healed suggests **[[ossicular chain disruption]]** (most commonly incus dislocation).
