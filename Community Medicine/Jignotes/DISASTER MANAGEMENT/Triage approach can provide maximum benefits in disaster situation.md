# [[DISASTER MANAGEMENT]] > Triage approach can provide maximum benefits in disaster situation

### Triage in Disaster Management

**Definition**
[[Triage]] is derived from the French word *trier* meaning "to sort" or "to choose." In the context of disaster management, it refers to the rapid classification of the injured on the basis of the **severity of their injuries** and the **likelihood of their survival** with prompt medical intervention.

**Core Principle**
In mass emergencies, the routine principle of "first come, first treated" is **NOT** followed. Instead, the approach shifts to doing the **"greatest good for the greatest number."**

**Why Triage Provides Maximum Benefit**
1.  **Optimal Resource Utilization:** It ensures limited medical resources (personnel, supplies, transport) are focused where they will have the highest impact on survival.
2.  **Prioritization:** Higher priority is granted to victims whose immediate or long-term prognosis can be dramatically affected by simple care (e.g., airway management, hemorrhage control).
3.  **Efficiency:** Patients requiring extensive attention with questionable benefits (moribund) are assigned low priority to prevent draining resources needed for salvageable patients.
4.  **Order from Chaos:** It organizes the flow of patients from the disaster site to hospitals, preventing the overwhelming of facilities.

### The Four-Color Code System
The most commonly accepted international classification uses color-coded tags to identify priority,:

| Color Code | Priority | Category | Description/Criteria | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RED** | **I** (Highest) | **Immediate** | Life-threatening injuries but **high likelihood of survival** with immediate intervention. | Immediate resuscitation or surgery required (within **6 hours**). |
| **YELLOW** | **II** (High) | **Urgent/Delayed** | Serious injuries but stable enough to wait for a short period without risking life/limb. | Possible resuscitation or surgery required (within **24 hours**). |
| **GREEN** | **III** (Low) | **Ambulatory** | Minor injuries; "Walking Wounded." | Minor illness/ambulatory care. Can wait or assist others. |
| **BLACK** | **IV** (Least) | **Dead/Moribund** | Dead or unsalvageable injuries (e.g., severe head trauma with exposed brain). | No treatment/palliative care only. Move to mortuary area. |

### The Triage Process
Triage is an ongoing process, not a one-time event. It is best carried out at the **site of the disaster**.

1.  **Triage Sieve:** A quick survey to separate the dead and the "walking wounded" from those who are injured and need assessment.
2.  **Triage Sort:** Detailed assessment of the remaining casualties to allocate them into Red, Yellow, or Black categories.
3.  **Tagging:** Identification tags are attached to victims indicating their name, age, place of origin, triage category, and initial treatment.
4.  **Stabilization:** Basic measures (clearing airway, controlling bleeding) are performed at the triage site before transport.

### Types of Triage
*   **Simple Triage:** Sorting patients into those who need critical attention vs. less serious injuries before transport.
*   **S.T.A.R.T. (Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment):** A system performed by lightly-trained personnel using specific parameters (Respiration, Perfusion, Mental Status).
*   **Reverse Triage:** In specific scenarios (e.g., war or extreme scarcity), less wounded are treated first to return them to duty or conserve resources for those most likely to survive.

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Ethical Shift:** Clinicians must shift their mindset from "doing everything for one patient" to utilitarianism ("saving the most lives possible").
*   **Dynamic Nature:** A patient tagged "Yellow" may deteriorate to "Red," requiring constant reassessment.
*   **Disaster Site Management:** The [[Medical Coordinator]] works closely with the Triage Officer to manage the flow of patients to mobilization areas.

### Mnemonics for Triage Colors
*   **R**ed = **R**equires Resuscitation (Immediate)
*   **Y**ellow = **Y**ou can wait (Delayed)
*   **G**reen = **G**o (Walking wounded)
*   **B**lack = **B**locked airway/Breathless (Dead)
