# Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis (CST)

[[Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis]] is a septic thrombosis of the cavernous sinus, representing a disastrous sequela resulting from the spread of sepsis along tributaries from infected sinuses, ear, nose, face, or teeth. It is a life-threatening condition requiring urgent diagnosis and management.

### Anatomy and Relations
The [[Cavernous Sinus]] is a large venous sinus situated in the middle cranial fossa on either side of the sphenoid bone body. Understanding the anatomy explains the clinical signs.

*   **Structures passing through the sinus:**
    *   **Center:** [[Abducent Nerve]] (CN VI) and [[Internal Carotid Artery]] (ICA).
    *   **Lateral Wall:** [[Oculomotor Nerve]] (CN III), [[Trochlear Nerve]] (CN IV), Ophthalmic division of Trigeminal (CN V1), and Maxillary division of Trigeminal (CN V2),.
*   **Communications:** The two sinuses communicate medially via transverse sinuses, facilitating the rapid spread of infection from one side to the other.

### Etiology and Routes of Infection
Infection spreads via valveless veins from various sources,,:
1.  **Anteriorly:** Via superior and inferior ophthalmic veins. Sources: Facial wounds, erysipelas, squeezing a stye/furuncle, [[Orbital Cellulitis]].
2.  **Posteriorly:** Via superior and inferior petrosal sinuses. Sources: [[Otitis Media]] (middle ear infection), mastoiditis.
3.  **Superiorly:** Via cerebral veins. Sources: [[Meningitis]], cerebral abscess.
4.  **Inferiorly:** Via pterygoid venous plexus. Sources: Dental abscess, pharyngeal infection.

### Clinical Features
The condition typically starts unilaterally but becomes **bilateral in >50% of cases** within 24–48 hours due to intercavernous communications,.

#### 1. General Systemic Features
*   Abrupt onset.
*   **Severe toxemia:** High-grade fever with chills and rigors (“picket-fence” fever).
*   Severe headache, vomiting, and drowsiness/stupor,.

#### 2. Ocular Signs
*   **Pain:** Severe pain in the eye and forehead (V1 involvement).
*   **Proptosis:** Rapidly developing, axial proptosis. Initially unilateral, then bilateral.
*   **Chemosis and Congestion:** Marked swelling of conjunctiva and lids.
*   **Fundus:** Retinal veins become engorged and tortuous; [[Papilledema]] may develop late,.

#### 3. Neurological Signs (Ophthalmoplegia)
*   **Sequential Palsy:** The **[[Abducent Nerve]] (CN VI)** is involved first as it lies freely in the center of the sinus,.
    *   This is followed by involvement of CN III and IV (lateral wall).
*   **The "Other Eye" Sign:** Involvement of the contralateral eye (often starting with lateral rectus palsy) is diagnostic of CST.
*   **Pupil:**
    *   Initially: Internal ophthalmoplegia (dilated and fixed pupil) due to CN III palsy.
    *   *Note:* The pupil may not be fully dilated due to simultaneous oculosympathetic involvement (Sympathetic fibers run along the ICA).
*   **Sensory Loss:** Diminished corneal sensation and anesthesia over the forehead due to involvement of the Ophthalmic division (V1) of the [[Trigeminal Nerve]],.

#### 4. Pathognomonic Sign
*   **Mastoid Edema:** Edema in the mastoid region due to back pressure in the mastoid emissary vein (which connects the sigmoid sinus to the exterior),,.

### Differential Diagnosis
It is crucial to differentiate CST from [[Orbital Cellulitis]] and [[Orbital Apex Syndrome]].

| Feature | [[Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis]] | [[Orbital Apex Syndrome]] | [[Orbital Cellulitis]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Laterality** | Bilateral (starts unilateral), | Always Unilateral | Unilateral |
| **Systemic Signs** | Marked (High fever, rigors, toxemia) | Mild | Moderate (Fever) |
| **Proptosis** | Marked/Severe | Mild | Marked |
| **Ophthalmoplegia** | Complete (Sequential); bilateral involvement common | Complete (Concurrent); unilateral | Painful and limited due to muscle swelling |
| **Vision Loss** | Late onset (or due to exposure keratopathy) | **Complete/Early loss** (CN II involvement) | Usually not affected early |
| **Sensory Loss** | V1 and V2 (Ophthalmic & Maxillary) | V1 (Ophthalmic) | None |
| **Specific Signs** | **Mastoid Edema** | None | None |

### Investigations
*   **Imaging:**
    *   **MRI with MR Venography (MRA/MRV):** Investigation of choice. Shows absence of flow void in thrombosed sinuses.
    *   **CT Scan:** Head and orbit to show sinus involvement and proptosis.
*   **Laboratory:**
    *   **Blood Culture:** Recommended for sepsis.
    *   Complete Blood Count: Shows leukocytosis.

### Management
This is a life-threatening emergency requiring hospitalization.

**1. Antibiotic Therapy**
*   **Intravenous Antibiotics:** Massive doses of broad-spectrum antibiotics are the sheet anchor of treatment.
*   Ideally governed by culture sensitivity, but empirical treatment covers Staph. aureus, Streptococci, and anaerobes.

**2. Symptomatic Treatment**
*   Analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs for pain and fever control.

**3. Anticoagulants**
*   Role is controversial but may be considered to prevent thrombus propagation.

### Complications
If untreated, the mortality rate is high. Complications include:
*   [[Meningitis]] or Encephalitis.
*   [[Brain Abscess]].
*   Pulmonary infarction (septic emboli).
*   General septicemia.
