# [[Nutrition And Health]] > Classification of Foods and Nutrients

### Classification of Foods

Foods are classified in multiple ways based on origin, chemical composition, function, and nutritive value. This multi-axial classification helps in understanding dietary planning and nutritional assessment.

#### 1. Classification by Origin
*   **Foods of Animal Origin:** Milk, meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and cheese.
*   **Foods of Vegetable Origin:** Cereals, pulses, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and oilseeds.

#### 2. Classification by Chemical Composition
*   **Proteins**
*   **Fats**
*   **Carbohydrates**
*   **Vitamins**
*   **Minerals**.

#### 3. Classification by Predominant Function
This classification is highly relevant for public health and community nutrition education.

| Functional Group | Description | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Body-Building Foods]]** | Rich in proteins; essential for growth and repair of tissues. | Milk, meat, poultry, fish, eggs, pulses, groundnuts, oilseeds. |
| **[[Energy-Giving Foods]]** | Rich in carbohydrates and fats; provide fuel for the body. | Cereals, sugars, roots and tubers, fats and oils. |
| **[[Protective Foods]]** | Rich in vitamins and minerals; protect against diseases and regulate body functions. | Vegetables, fruits, milk. |

> **Clinical Relevance:** In diet planning for a patient with an infection or recovering from surgery, **Body-Building Foods** are prioritized for tissue repair. For manual laborers, **Energy-Giving Foods** are emphasized.

#### 4. Classification by Nutritive Value
This is often used for dietary surveys and detailed nutritional analysis.
1.  **Cereals and Millets** (e.g., Rice, Wheat, Ragi, Bajra)
2.  **Pulses** (Legumes)
3.  **Vegetables**
4.  **Nuts and Oilseeds**
5.  **Fruits**
6.  **Animal Foods**
7.  **Fats and Oils**
8.  **Sugar and Jaggery**
9.  **Condiments and Spices**
10. **Miscellaneous Foods**.

### Classification of Nutrients

Nutrients are organic and inorganic complexes contained in food. There are approximately 50 different nutrients supplied through food. They are broadly divided into **Macronutrients** and **Micronutrients**.

> Flowchart showing the division of Nutrients into Macronutrients (Proteins, Fats, Carbs) and Micronutrients (Vitamins, Minerals)

#### 1. Macronutrients (Proximate Principles)
These form the main bulk of the food and are required in large amounts. They are the primary sources of energy and structural material.

| Nutrient | Energy Yield | Contribution to Total Energy (Indian Diet) | Key Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Proteins]]** | 4 kcal/g | 7–15% (10-15%) | Body building, repair, maintenance of osmotic pressure. |
| **[[Fats]]** | 9 kcal/g | 10–30% (15-30%) | Concentrated energy source, absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. |
| **[[Carbohydrates]]** | 4 kcal/g | 65–80% (50-70%) | Main source of energy. |

**Classification of Proteins (Amino Acids):**
Proteins are made of amino acids.
*   **[[Essential Amino Acids]] (Indispensable):** Cannot be synthesized by the body; must be obtained from diet.
    *   **Mnemonic:** **PVT TIM HALL**
        *   **P**henylalanine
        *   **V**aline
        *   **T**hreonine
        *   **T**ryptophan
        *   **I**soleucine
        *   **M**ethionine
        *   **H**istidine (Essential for infants/Semi-essential)
        *   **A**rginine (Semi-essential)
        *   **L**eucine
        *   **L**ysine.
*   **Non-Essential Amino Acids:** Can be synthesized by the body (e.g., Glycine, Serine, Proline).

**Classification of Fats:**
*   **Saturated Fatty Acids:** Animal fats (Ghee, Butter), Coconut oil.
*   **Unsaturated Fatty Acids:**
    *   **MUFA (Mono-unsaturated):** Oleic acid.
    *   **PUFA (Poly-unsaturated):** Linoleic acid, $\alpha$-linolenic acid.
*   **[[Essential Fatty Acids]] (EFA):** Linoleic acid (n-6) and $\alpha$-Linolenic acid (n-3). These cannot be synthesized by the body.
    *   *Deficiency:* leads to **Phrynoderma** (Toad skin).

#### 2. Micronutrients
Required in small amounts (milligrams or micrograms) but essential for health.

**A. [[Vitamins]]**
Organic compounds essential for metabolic processes.
*   **Fat Soluble:** Vitamins A, D, E, K.
*   **Water Soluble:** B-Group Vitamins (Thiamine, Riboflavin, Niacin, B6, B12, Folic Acid, Pantothenic acid) and Vitamin C.

**B. [[Minerals]]**
Inorganic elements required for growth, repair, and regulation.
*   **Major Minerals:** Required in larger amounts.
    *   Examples: Calcium, Phosphorus, Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium.
*   **Trace Elements:** Required in quantities less than a few milligrams/day.
    *   Examples: Iron, Iodine, Fluorine, Zinc, Copper, Cobalt, Selenium.
*   **Trace Contaminants:** No known function; harmful.
    *   Examples: Lead, Mercury, Arsenic, Aluminum.

> **Clinical Relevance: Hidden Hunger**
> Micronutrient deficiencies (e.g., Iron, Iodine, Vitamin A) are often referred to as "Hidden Hunger" because they may not present with obvious hunger pangs but cause significant health damage like anemia, goiter, and night blindness.
