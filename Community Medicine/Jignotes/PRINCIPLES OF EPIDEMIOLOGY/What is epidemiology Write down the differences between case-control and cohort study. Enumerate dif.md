# [[PRINCIPLES OF EPIDEMIOLOGY]] > What is epidemiology? Write down the differences between case-control and cohort study. Enumerate different types of biases in analytical epidemiological studies.

### **I. Definition of Epidemiology**

The term **Epidemiology** is derived from the Greek words *Epi* (among), *Demos* (people), and *Logos* (study).

It is defined by John M. Last as:
"The study of the **distribution** and **determinants** of health-related states or events in specified populations, and the application of this study to the control of health problems."

**Key Components of the Definition:**
1.  **[[Disease Frequency]]:** Measurement of disease (Rates, Ratios, and Proportions).
2.  **[[Distribution]]:** Analysis by **Time** (when), **Place** (where), and **Person** (who).
3.  **[[Determinants]]:** Search for causes or risk factors (Why and How).

### **II. Differences Between Case-Control and Cohort Study**

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Schematic diagram comparing Case-Control (Backward looking) vs Cohort (Forward looking) study designs

| Feature | [[Case-Control Study]] | [[Cohort Study]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Direction of Inquiry** | Proceeds from **Effect to Cause** (Backward looking/Retrospective). | Proceeds from **Cause to Effect** (Forward looking/Prospective). |
| **Starting Point** | Starts with the **Disease** (Cases vs Controls). | Starts with **Exposure** to risk factor (Exposed vs Non-exposed). |
| **Incidence Calculation** | **Cannot** measure incidence directly. | **Can** measure [[Incidence]] directly. |
| **Risk Measurement** | Yields **[[Odds Ratio]]** (an estimate of Relative Risk). | Yields **[[Relative Risk]]** and **[[Attributable Risk]]**. |
| **Suitability** | Best for **Rare Diseases**. | Best for **Rare Exposures** (but inappropriate for rare diseases). |
| **Cost & Time** | Relatively **Inexpensive** and **Rapid**. | **Expensive** and **Time-consuming** (Long follow-up needed). |
| **Sample Size** | Requires **fewer** subjects. | Requires **larger** number of subjects. |
| **outcomes** | Investigates only **one** outcome. | Can study **multiple** outcomes related to a single exposure. |
| **Major Problem** | **[[Recall Bias]]** (Memory bias) is common. | **[[Attrition]]** (Loss to follow-up) is a major problem. |

### **III. Biases in Analytical Epidemiological Studies**

[[Bias]] is defined as any **systematic error** in the determination of the association between exposure and disease. It results in results that differ systematically from the true values.

**1. [[Selection Bias]]**
*   This occurs when the groups to be compared are differentially susceptible to the outcome even before the study begins.
*   The cases and controls may not be representative of the general population.
*   *Example:* **[[Berkesonian Bias]]** (Admission rate bias) – This arises because hospital cases and controls have different rates of admission compared to the general population.

**2. [[Information Bias]] (Observation Bias)**
Errors arising from measurement of exposure or outcome.
*   **[[Recall Bias]] (Memory Bias):** Cases (diseased) are more likely to recall the existence of past events or risk factors than healthy controls. This is a major defect in case-control studies.
*   **[[Interviewer's Bias]]:** Occurs when the interviewer knows the hypothesis or the disease status and probes cases more thoroughly than controls.

**3. [[Confounding]]**
*   A confounding factor is associated with both the exposure and the disease and is distributed unequally in the study and control groups.
*   It is an independent risk factor for the disease.
*   *Example:* In a study of Alcohol and Esophageal Cancer, **Smoking** is a confounder.

**4. [[Neyman Bias]] (Prevalence-Incidence Bias)**
*   This arises when a study misses fatal cases (who died before the study) or mild/silent cases (who recovered quickly), leading to an incorrect estimate of the association.

**5. [[Attrition Bias]]**
*   Occurs due to **loss to follow-up** of participants in longitudinal studies (Cohort or RCTs). If attrition is substantial (>10%), validity is compromised.

**6. [[Hawthorne Effect]] (Attention Bias)**
*   Study subjects systematically alter their behavior simply because they know they are being observed.

**Clinical Relevance:**
*   **Blindness** (Single/Double/Triple) is used to remove **Information Bias**.
*   **Randomization** is the best method to remove **Selection Bias** and **Confounding**.
