# [[Spine]] > Spinal Trauma Assessment

# Spinal Trauma Assessment (ASIA Scale)

The **American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA)** International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) is the gold standard for assessing the neurological status of patients with [[spinal cord injury]]. It systematically evaluates motor and sensory function to determine the neurological level of injury and completeness of the injury.

### Prerequisites for Assessment
Before a definitive prognosis or ASIA score can be assigned, the patient must be out of [[spinal shock]].
*   **Spinal Shock:** A state of transient physiological reflex depression of cord function below the level of injury. It is characterized by flaccid paralysis, anesthesia, and absent reflexes.
*   **Resolution:** The return of the [[bulbocavernosus reflex]] (anal sphincter contraction in response to squeezing the glans penis or clitoris) marks the end of spinal shock. Only then can the injury be accurately classified as complete or incomplete.

### Components of the ASIA Examination

The assessment consists of three key parts: Sensory examination, Motor examination, and the Anorectal examination.

#### 1. Sensory Examination
Testing is performed on 28 specific [[dermatomes]] on each side of the body.
*   **Modalities tested:**
    *   Light touch.
    *   Pinprick (sharp/dull discrimination).
*   **Scoring:**
    *   0 = Absent.
    *   1 = Altered (impaired/hyperesthesia).
    *   2 = Normal.
    *   NT = Not testable.

**Key Dermatome Landmarks:**
| Level | Anatomic Landmark |
| :--- | :--- |
| **C4** | Clavicles/Supraclavicular fossa |
| **C5** | Lateral side of antecubital fossa |
| **C6** | Thumb (dorsal surface) |
| **C7** | Middle finger |
| **C8** | Little finger |
| **T4** | Nipple line |
| **T10** | Umbilicus |
| **T12** | Inguinal ligament |
| **L4** | Medial malleolus |
| **L5** | Dorsum of foot (3rd MTP joint) |
| **S1** | Lateral heel |
| **S4-5** | Perianal area (Crucial for sacral sparing) |

#### 2. Motor Examination
Ten key muscle groups (myotomes) are tested bilaterally. Power is graded using the **Medical Research Council (MRC) Scale** (0–5).

**Key Myotomes (Upper Limb):**
*   **C5:** [[Elbow flexors]] (Biceps, Brachialis).
*   **C6:** [[Wrist extensors]] (Extensor carpi radialis longus/brevis).
*   **C7:** [[Elbow extensors]] (Triceps).
*   **C8:** [[Finger flexors]] (Flexor digitorum profundus to middle finger).
*   **T1:** [[Finger abductors]] (Abductor digiti minimi).

**Key Myotomes (Lower Limb):**
*   **L2:** [[Hip flexors]] (Iliopsoas).
*   **L3:** [[Knee extensors]] (Quadriceps).
*   **L4:** [[Ankle dorsiflexors]] (Tibialis anterior).
*   **L5:** [[Long toe extensors]] (Extensor hallucis longus).
*   **S1:** [[Ankle plantar flexors]] (Gastrocnemius/Soleus).

**Clinical Implication:** In spinal trauma, the functional level is the lowest segment with at least Grade 3 power (against gravity), provided all segments above are Grade 5 (normal).

#### 3. Anorectal Examination
This is the most critical step to distinguish between a **complete** and **incomplete** injury.
*   **Sensory:** Sensation in the anal mucocutaneous junction (S4-S5).
*   **Motor:** Voluntary anal contraction (VAC) upon digital rectal examination.
*   **Deep Anal Pressure (DAP):** Presence of deep pressure sensation.

### Definitions of Injury Levels

*   **Sensory Level:** The lowest dermatome with a normal score (2/2) for both pinprick and light touch.
*   **Motor Level:** The lowest myotome with a muscle grade of at least 3, provided the key muscles above that level are graded 5.
*   **Neurological Level of Injury (NLI):** The lowest segment of the spinal cord with intact sensory and motor function on both sides of the body.
*   **Complete Injury:** Absence of sensory and motor function in the lowest sacral segments (S4-S5). (No sacral sparing).
*   **Incomplete Injury:** Preservation of sensory and/or motor function in the lowest sacral segments (S4-S5). (Presence of sacral sparing).

### The ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS)

This scale grades the severity of the spinal cord injury based on the findings above.

| Grade | Description | Clinical Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A** | **Complete** | No sensory or motor function is preserved in the sacral segments S4-S5. |
| **B** | **Incomplete (Sensory only)** | Sensory but not motor function is preserved below the [[neurological level]] and includes the sacral segments S4-S5. |
| **C** | **Incomplete (Motor non-functional)** | Motor function is preserved below the neurological level, and **more than half** of key muscles below the NLI have a muscle grade **less than 3**. |
| **D** | **Incomplete (Motor functional)** | Motor function is preserved below the neurological level, and **at least half** of key muscles below the NLI have a muscle grade of **3 or more**. |
| **E** | **Normal** | Sensory and motor function is normal. |

### Clinical Syndromes Associated with Incomplete Injuries

While ASIA categorizes severity, specific patterns of incomplete cord injury often present clinically:

**1. Central Cord Syndrome**
*   **Mechanism:** Hyperextension injury in an elderly patient with [[cervical spondylosis]].
*   **Features:** Weakness in **Upper Limbs > Lower Limbs**.
*   **Anatomy:** Fibers to the upper limbs are located centrally in the corticospinal tract; lower limb fibers are peripheral.
*   **Prognosis:** Good for ambulation, poor for fine hand function.

**2. Anterior Cord Syndrome**
*   **Mechanism:** Flexion injury or thrombosis of the [[anterior spinal artery]].
*   **Features:** Complete motor paralysis (corticospinal) and loss of pain/temperature (spinothalamic) below the lesion.
*   **Sparing:** [[Dorsal columns]] are intact (proprioception and vibration preserved).
*   **Prognosis:** Poor for motor recovery.

**3. Brown-Séquard Syndrome**
*   **Mechanism:** Hemisection of the cord (e.g., penetrating trauma).
*   **Features:**
    *   **Ipsilateral:** Loss of motor function (spastic paralysis) and proprioception/vibration.
    *   **Contralateral:** Loss of pain and temperature sensation (usually 1-2 levels below the lesion).
*   **Prognosis:** Best prognosis for ambulation among incomplete syndromes.

### Mnemonics for Key Myotomes

**Upper Limb:**
*   **C5, 6:** Pick up sticks (Biceps/Wrist extension).
*   **C7, 8:** Lay them straight (Triceps/Finger flexion).
*   **T1:** Fingers run (Abduction).

**Lower Limb:**
*   **L3, 4:** Kick the door (Knee extension/Ankle dorsiflexion).
*   **L5:** Stay alive (Great toe extension).
*   **S1, 2:** Jump in the shoe (Plantar flexion).
