# Eye Banking and Corneal Preservation

### **Introduction to Eye Banking**
An [[Eye Bank]] is a medical organization dedicated to the collection, storage, processing, and distribution of corneal tissue for the purpose of [[Keratoplasty]] (corneal grafting), research, and supply of eye tissue for other ophthalmic purposes.

**Functions of an Eye Bank:**
1.  **Promotion:** Increasing public awareness about eye donation.
2.  **Registration:** Maintaining a registry of pledgers for eye donation.
3.  **Collection:** Harvesting donated eyes from the deceased.
4.  **Processing:** Evaluating and processing the donor eyes.
5.  **Preservation:** storing tissue for short, intermediate, or long terms.
6.  **Distribution:** Allocating donor tissue to corneal surgeons based on waiting lists.
7.  **Research:** Improving preservation methodology and utilization of other eye components.

**Key Personnel:**
*   **Eye Bank In-charge:** Qualified ophthalmologist.
*   **Eye Bank Technician:** Trained to assist in enucleation, processing, and maintaining asepsis.
*   **Grief Counselor/Social Worker:** Promotes voluntary donation and counsels relatives of the deceased.

### **Eye Donation Dynamics**
The collection and use of donated eyes are regulated by laws such as **'The Transplantation of Human Organs Act'**.

**Facts about Eye Donation:**
*   **Donor Eligibility:** Almost anyone at any age can pledge; the primary requirement is a clear, healthy [[Cornea]].
*   **Timing:** Eyes must be harvested within **6 hours** of death (can extend to 12 hours in cold climates or if the body is refrigerated).
*   **Impact:** One donation can give sight to two blind persons.
*   **Consent:** Eyes cannot be removed without the consent of the next of kin, even if the deceased had pledged their eyes.
*   **Commercialization:** Donated eyes are never bought or sold.

**Collection Methods:**
1.  **Whole Globe (Enucleation):** Removal of the entire eyeball. Transported in a moist chamber to the bank for processing.
2.  **In Situ Excision:** Removal of the corneoscleral rim only. Placed directly into the storage medium at the site of retrieval.

### **Donor Selection and Screening**
Strict screening is performed to ensure the safety of the recipient and the quality of the graft. This involves medical history, physical examination, and serological testing.

**Contraindications for Eye Donation:**
Donors with the following conditions are considered **unsuitable** due to the high risk of disease transmission or poor tissue quality:

**Absolute Contraindications (Infectious/Malignancy):**
*   **Viral Infections:** [[HIV]]/AIDS, [[Hepatitis B]] (HBsAg), [[Hepatitis C]], [[Rabies]].
*   **Neurological Diseases:** [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease]] (CJD), Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE), Unexplained central nervous system diseases.
*   **Systemic Infections:** Active [[Septicaemia]], Viremia, [[Syphilis]], [[Tuberculosis]] (Meningitis).
*   **Malignancies:** Disseminated haematological malignancies (Leukemia, Lymphoma), Blast forms of tumors, Active ocular inflammation (e.g., [[Retinoblastoma]], [[Malignant Melanoma]]).
*   **Unknown cause of death.**

**Relative Contraindications/Poor Tissue Quality:**
*   Death from unknown cause.
*   Gross anterior segment pathology (e.g., [[Glaucoma]], [[Iridocyclitis]]).

### **Evaluation of Donor Tissue**
Before distribution, the donor tissue undergoes rigorous evaluation.

**1. Biomicroscopic Examination (Slit Lamp):**
The tissue is graded based on the condition of the epithelium, stroma, and endothelium.

| Grade | Description | Cornea Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Grade I** | Excellent | Crystal clear stroma, no epithelial defects, no endothelial defects. |
| **Grade II** | Very Good | Clear stroma, slight epithelial haze/defects, few Descemet's folds. |
| **Grade III** | Good | Slight stromal cloudiness, moderate epithelial defects, moderate folds. |
| **Grade IV** | Fair/Poor | Moderate/Marked cloudiness, heavy epithelial defects, guttata present. |

**2. Specular Microscopy:**
*   Used to assess **endothelial cell density** and morphology.
*   **Clinical Implication:** A minimum cell count of **1500–2000 cells/mm²** (preferably >2000) is generally required for optical [[Penetrating Keratoplasty]].

**3. Serology:**
*   Blood from the deceased is tested for HIV, Hep B, Hep C, and Syphilis.

### **Corneal Preservation Methods**
Preservation maintains the viability of the [[Corneal Endothelium]] (the critical layer for graft clarity) during the interval between retrieval and surgery.

#### **1. Short-Term Storage (Up to 48 - 96 hours)**
*   **Moist Chamber:** The whole globe is stored in a sterile jar at **4°C**. Viable for up to **24 hours**.
*   **M-K Medium (McCarey-Kaufman):**
    *   **Composition:** Tissue Culture (TC)-199, 5% Dextran-40 (dehydrating agent), HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), and antibiotics (Gentamicin).
    *   **Storage:** Corneoscleral rim stored at **4°C**.
    *   **Duration:** Up to **96 hours** (4 days).

#### **2. Intermediate-Term Storage (Up to 2 weeks)**
This is the most commonly used method worldwide.
*   **Media Types:** **Optisol-GS**, Cornisol, Eusol, Dexol.
*   **Composition of Optisol-GS:**
    *   **Chondroitin Sulphate (2.5%)** & **Dextran (1%):** Deswelling agents.
    *   **Nutrients:** Vitamins (B12), ATP precursors, Ascorbic acid.
    *   **Antibiotics:** Gentamicin and Streptomycin.
*   **Storage:** Refrigerated at **2–8°C**.
*   **Duration:** Maintains viability for **10–14 days**.

#### **3. Long-Term Storage (Months to Years)**
*   **Organ Culture:**
    *   Corneas stored in media (like Eagle’s MEM) at **30°C to 37°C**.
    *   **Duration:** Up to **30-35 days**. allows better detection of contamination but technically complex.
*   **Glycerine Preservation:**
    *   Uses 95% Glycerine or Silica gel.
    *   **Duration:** Indefinite/Years.
    *   **Use:** Tissue is non-viable (cells are dead). Used only for **Tectonic Grafts** (structural repair) or [[Lamellar Keratoplasty]] where live endothelium is not required.
*   **Cryopreservation:**
    *   Frozen at **-70°C** or in liquid nitrogen.
    *   **Duration:** Up to 1 year. rarely used now due to technical difficulty.
