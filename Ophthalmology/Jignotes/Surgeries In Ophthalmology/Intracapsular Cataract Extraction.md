# [[Surgeries In Ophthalmology]] > Intracapsular Cataract Extraction

# Intracapsular Cataract Extraction (ICCE) & Associated Instruments

### Overview
[[Intracapsular Cataract Extraction]] (ICCE) is a surgical technique where the entire [[crystalline lens]] is removed along with its intact [[lens capsule]].
*   **Current Status:** It has largely been replaced by [[Extracapsular Cataract Extraction]] (ECCE) and [[Phacoemulsification]] due to higher complication rates.
*   **Indications:** Currently reserved for markedly **subluxated** or **dislocated lenses** where the zonules are already compromised.
*   **Historical Importance:** It was the standard procedure from 1880–1980.

### Surgical Instruments for ICCE

#### 1. Eye Speculums
Used to keep the eyelids apart and the eye open during surgery.
*   **Universal Metallic Eye Speculum:** Has two limbs and a spring mechanism with a screw to adjust the width. Can be used for either the right or left eye.
*   **Eye Speculum with Guard:** Has solid blades to cover the eyelashes and keep them away from the sterile operating field.
*   **Wire Speculum (Barraquer):** Very light, causing minimal pressure on the [[eyeball]].
*   **Uses:**
    *   Intraocular surgeries ([[Cataract]], [[Glaucoma]], [[Keratoplasty]]).
    *   Extraocular surgeries ([[Squint]], [[Pterygium]]).

#### 2. Superior Rectus Holding Forceps
*   **Description:** A toothed forceps (1 x 2 teeth) characterized by an **S-shaped double curve** near the tip.
*   **Use:**
    *   To grasp the [[Superior Rectus muscle]] belly to pass a **bridle suture**.
    *   This suture fixes the eye in a downward gaze during surgery.

#### 3. Silcock’s Needle Holder
*   **Description:** A large, stout needle holder. The upper shank has a flat, broad plate to accommodate the surgeon's thumb.
*   **Use:** Specifically designed for passing the **superior rectus bridle suture** due to the toughness of the muscle belly and need for a firm grip.

#### 4. Von Graefe’s Cataract Knife
*   **Description:** A long, narrow, thin, straight blade with a sharp tip and a cutting edge on one side.
*   **Use (Historical):**
    *   Used to make an **ab-interno corneoscleral incision** in classical ICCE.
    *   Used for the "Four-dot iridectomy" in [[iris bombe]].
*   **Current Status:** largely obsolete; replaced by keratomes and razor blade fragments.

#### 5. Corneal Spring Scissors (Section Enlarging Scissors)
*   **Description:** Fine curved scissors where the cutting blades are kept apart by spring action. Can be universal (for both sides) or specific (Right/Left).
*   **Use:**
    *   To **enlarge** the corneoscleral or corneal incision after the initial entry is made (with a keratome or knife) to allow sufficient space for lens delivery.
    *   Used in [[Keratoplasty]] and [[Trabeculectomy]].

#### 6. Intracapsular Forceps (Arruga’s Capsule Holding Forceps)
*   **Description:** The inner side of the tip of each limb has a smooth **cup**. The margins are very smooth to grasp the capsule without tearing it.
*   **Use:**
    *   **Capsule Forceps Method:** The forceps grasp the anterior [[lens capsule]] at the 6 o'clock position.
    *   The lens is lifted slightly to rupture zonules and extracted via sliding or tumbling movements.

#### 7. Lens Expressor (Smith’s Lens Expressor/Hook)
*   **Description:** A flat metal handle with a rounded curve at one end. The tip of the curve is knobbed. The handle plane is at a right angle to the hook curvature.
*   **Use:**
    *   **Smith’s Indian Method (Tumbling):** Applied at the [[limbus]] at the 6 o'clock position to exert pressure, causing the inferior zonules to rupture and the lens to tumble out.
    *   Acts as a counter-pressure tool during nucleus expression in ECCE.

#### 8. Vectis (Wire Vectis)
*   **Description:** A wire loop attached to a metallic handle.
*   **Use:**
    *   **ICCE:** To remove a **subluxated** or **dislocated lens** (scooping it out).
    *   **ECCE:** To remove the nucleus (nucleus delivery).

#### 9. McNamara’s Spoon (Lens Spatula)
*   **Description:** A flat metallic handle with tiny spoon-shaped ends.
*   **Use:**
    *   To apply **counter-pressure** at the 12 o'clock position during lens expression (assists the Lens Expressor).
    *   To support the lens or nucleus during delivery.

#### 10. Iris Repositor
*   **Description:** A delicate, flat, malleable, straight or bent blade with blunt edges.
*   **Use:**
    *   To **reposit the [[iris]]** back into the anterior chamber after lens delivery to prevent iris prolapse.
    *   To break [[synechiae]] at the pupillary margin.

#### 11. Needle Holder (General/Barraquer/Castroviejo)
*   **Description:**
    *   **Barraquer:** Spring action, fine curved/straight tips.
    *   **Castroviejo:** Spring action with an S-shaped locking mechanism.
*   **Use:** To hold fine needles (e.g., 10-0 nylon) for suturing the corneoscleral section, conjunctiva, or extraocular muscles.

### Clinical Implications of ICCE

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Principle** | Removal of lens + capsule + disruption of zonules. |
| **Methods of Delivery** | 1. **Cryoextraction:** Cryoprobe freezes lens (most common historical method).<br>2. **Forceps:** Arruga's forceps grasp capsule.<br>3. **Smith's Indian (Tumbling):** Pressure at 6 o'clock using Lens Expressor.<br>4. **Wire Vectis:** For subluxated lenses. |
| **Disadvantages** | 1. Large incision required (10-12mm).<br>2. High astigmatism.<br>3. Cannot implant [[Posterior Chamber Intraocular Lens]] (PC-IOL).<br>4. Higher risk of [[Vitreous loss]], [[Retinal Detachment]], and [[Cystoid Macular Edema]]. |
| **Aphakia Correction** | Since PC-IOL cannot be used (no capsule support), options include **Spectacles**, **Contact Lenses**, or **Anterior Chamber IOL** (AC-IOL). |

### Procedure Summary (Steps & Instrument Correlation)

1.  **Exposure:** Lids separated using **Universal Eye Speculum**.
2.  **Fixation:** **Superior Rectus Holding Forceps** grasp the SR muscle; **Silcock’s Needle Holder** passes the bridle suture.
3.  **Incision:** Partial thickness groove made; Anterior chamber entered (historically with **Von Graefe Knife**, now keratome). Incision enlarged with **Corneal Spring Scissors**.
4.  **Iridectomy:** Performed to prevent pupillary block (using Iris forceps and de Wecker’s scissors).
5.  **Zonulysis (Enzymatic):** Alpha-chymotrypsin (1:5000) used in young patients to dissolve zonules (Historical).
6.  **Lens Delivery:**
    *   *Forceps Method:* **Intracapsular Forceps** grasp capsule; **Lens Expressor** applies pressure.
    *   *Subluxated Lens:* **Wire Vectis** scoops the lens.
7.  **Iris Reposition:** **Iris Repositor** strokes the iris back into place.
8.  **Closure:** Corneoscleral sutures passed using **Needle Holder**.

### Mnemonics

*   **"MILS"** for Spiral of Tillaux (Distance of rectus muscle insertion from limbus):
    *   **M**edial Rectus (5.5 mm)
    *   **I**nferior Rectus (6.5 mm)
