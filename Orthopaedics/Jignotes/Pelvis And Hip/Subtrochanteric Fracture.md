# [[Pelvis And Hip]] > Subtrochanteric Fracture

# [[Subtrochanteric Fracture]]

### Definition
A **Subtrochanteric Fracture** is a fracture occurring in the zone of the [[proximal femur]] extending from the lower border of the [[lesser trochanter]] to approximately **5–7.5 cm** distally into the [[femoral shaft]]. 

This region corresponds to the transition from the cancellous bone of the intertrochanteric region to the cortical bone of the femoral shaft.

### Epidemiology and Etiology
These fractures account for 10–30% of all hip fractures. They have a **bimodal distribution**:
*   **Young Adults:** High-energy trauma (e.g., Road Traffic Accidents, Gunshot wounds, falls from height).
*   **Elderly:** Low-energy trauma (e.g., simple fall) due to weakened bone from [[osteoporosis]].

**Pathological Causes:**
*   **Metastasis:** Common site for pathological fractures due to high stress concentration.
*   **[[Paget’s disease]]:** Can cause "Banana fractures" (transverse stress fractures on the convex side of the deformed femur).
*   **Bisphosphonate Therapy:** Long-term use can lead to atypical subtrochanteric stress fractures.

### Surgical Anatomy and Pathomechanics
The subtrochanteric region is a site of **high stress concentration** in the body (up to 1200 lb/sq inch). Management is difficult due to powerful muscle forces that displace the fragments, making reduction challenging.

**Deforming Forces:**

| Fragment | Deformity | Responsible Muscle Groups |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Proximal Fragment]]** | **Flexion** | [[Iliopsoas]] (attached to lesser trochanter) |
| | **Abduction** | [[Gluteus medius]] and [[Gluteus minimus]] (attached to greater trochanter) |
| | **External Rotation** | Short external rotators (attached to intertrochanteric crest) |
| **[[Distal Fragment]]** | **Adduction** | [[Adductor magnus]] and longus |
| | **Shortening** | [[Quadriceps]] and [[Hamstrings]] |

### Classification

#### 1. Seinsheimer Classification
Based on the number of fragments and the location of fracture lines.
*   **Type I:** Non-displaced or < 2 mm displacement.
*   **Type II:** Two-part fracture (Transverse or Spiral).
*   **Type III:** Three-part fracture (Spiral or Butterfly fragment).
    *   **IIIA:** [[Lesser trochanter]] is part of the third fragment.
*   **Type IV:** Comminuted with 4 or more fragments.
*   **Type V:** Subtrochanteric fracture extending into the intertrochanteric region.

#### 2. Russell-Taylor Classification
This classification is clinically useful for determining the choice of implant (specifically nails).

| Type | Description | Implant Choice |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type I** | **Intact [[Piriformis Fossa]]** | Standard Interlocking Nail |
| **IA** | Lesser Trochanter intact | |
| **IB** | Lesser Trochanter fractured | |
| **Type II** | **Fractured [[Piriformis Fossa]]** | Reconstruction Nail or Hip Screw (DCS) |
| **IIA** | Lesser Trochanter intact | |
| **IIB** | Lesser Trochanter fractured | |

> **Clinical Implication:** The integrity of the piriformis fossa is crucial. If fractured, a standard antegrade nail starting at the piriformis fossa cannot be used as it will destabilize the fracture further.

### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:** Severe pain in the hip/thigh region, inability to move the limb.
*   **Signs:**
    *   Marked swelling and ecchymosis (high vascularity of the thigh muscles).
    *   **Deformity:** The leg typically appears shortened and externally rotated.
    *   Tenderness on palpation below the trochanter.
*   **Shock:** Potential for significant blood loss (up to 1500 ml) into the thigh compartments, leading to hypovolemic shock.

### Diagnosis and Imaging
*   **X-ray:** AP and Lateral views of the full femur (to rule out segmental fractures) and pelvis.
*   **CT Scan:** Useful for comminuted fractures or identifying intra-articular extensions.
*   **MRI:** If pathological fracture is suspected or for occult fractures.

### Management

**Challenges in Treatment:**
1.  **Cortical Bone:** The subtrochanteric region is cortical bone, which heals slower than the cancellous bone of the intertrochanteric region.
2.  **High Stress:** Implants must be strong enough to withstand high bending forces.
3.  **Muscle Forces:** Making reduction difficult.

#### 1. Conservative Management
*   **Indications:** Rarely used in adults. Reserved for children (skin traction/gallows) or patients medically unfit for anesthesia.
*   **Method:** Skeletal traction (e.g., [[Perkins traction]] or [[Bohler-Braun splint]]) for 10–12 weeks.
*   **Disadvantages:** Malunion (varus/external rotation), knee stiffness, complications of prolonged bed rest (DVT, bedsores).

#### 2. Operative Management (Standard of Care)
The goal is anatomical alignment and stable fixation to allow early mobilization.

**A. Intramedullary Devices (Gold Standard)**
*   **Implants:** [[Cephalomedullary nail]] (e.g., [[Proximal Femoral Nail]] - PFN, Reconstruction nail, Gamma nail).
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Load-sharing device (closer to the mechanical axis of the femur).
    *   Shorter lever arm reduces stress on the implant.
    *   Can be inserted using minimally invasive techniques (biological fixation).
*   **Technique:** Closed reduction on a fracture table. For Type II Russell-Taylor fractures (piriformis fossa involved), a trochanteric entry nail or a reconstruction nail is preferred.

**B. Extramedullary Devices (Plates)**
*   **Indications:** Extension of fracture into the piriformis fossa, complex comminution, or when nailing is technically not feasible.
*   **Implants:**
    *   **95-degree [[Condylar Blade Plate]].**
    *   **[[Dynamic Condylar Screw]] (DCS).**
    *   **Proximal Femoral Locking Compression Plate (PF-LCP).**
*   **Disadvantages:** Load-bearing device (higher rate of implant failure/breakage), requires extensive open exposure (periosteal stripping).

**C. Bone Grafting**
*   Indicated in cases of severe medial comminution or non-union to promote healing.

### Complications

*   **[[Malunion]]:**
    *   Commonest deformity is **Varus**, **Flexion**, and **External Rotation** (due to un-neutralized muscle forces).
*   **[[Non-union]]:**
    *   Due to cortical nature of bone, vascular damage, or distraction of fragments.
    *   Mechanical failure of the implant (implant breakage) often follows non-union.
*   **Implant Failure:**
    *   "Cut-out" of the screw from the femoral head.
    *   Breakage of the nail or plate due to cyclic loading if union is delayed.
*   **Infection:** Higher risk with open reduction and plating.

### Mnemonics
**Deforming Forces:**
*   **P**roximal fragment **P**ops up (Flexion & Abduction).
*   **D**istal fragment **D**rops (Adduction & Extension).
