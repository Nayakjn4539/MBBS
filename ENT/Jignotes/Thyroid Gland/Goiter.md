# [[Thyroid Gland]] > Goiter

# Goiter

**Definition**: Goiter is defined as a generalized enlargement of the [[Thyroid gland]]. It indicates an increase in the volume of the thyroid parenchyma. It does not imply a specific etiology or functional status (euthyroid, hypothyroid, or hyperthyroid).

### Surgical Anatomy Highlights
*   **Location**: Deep to the cervical strap muscles, extending from the middle of the thyroid cartilage to the 4th or 5th tracheal rings.
*   **Movement**: The gland moves up with deglutition because of the **Posterior Suspensory Ligament ([[Berry's Ligament]])**, which attaches the posteromedial aspect of the lobe to the cricoid cartilage and trachea.
*   **Capsules**:
    *   *True Capsule*: Peripheral condensation of connective tissue.
    *   *False Capsule*: Derived from the pretracheal layer of deep cervical fascia.

### Classification of Goiter

| Classification Type | Subtypes | Clinical Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Physiological** | Puberty, Pregnancy, Lactation | Transient enlargement due to increased body demand. |
| **Non-toxic (Simple)** | • Endemic (Iodine deficiency)<br>• Sporadic (Goitrogens, dyshormonogenesis) | Diffuse or Multinodular. Patient is usually euthyroid. |
| **Toxic** | • Primary ([[Graves’ disease]])<br>• Secondary (Toxic [[Multinodular Goiter]])<br>• Toxic Adenoma | Associated with hyperthyroidism (Thyrotoxicosis). |
| **Neoplastic** | • Benign ([[Adenoma]])<br>• Malignant (Papillary, Follicular, Medullary, Anaplastic) | Solitary nodules or diffuse hard mass. |
| **Inflammatory** | • Autoimmune ([[Hashimoto’s thyroiditis]])<br>• [[Riedel’s thyroiditis]]<br>• De Quervain's thyroiditis | Painful or painless, firm to hard consistency. |

### Etiology and Risk Factors
1.  **Iodine Deficiency**: The most common cause worldwide (Endemic goiter). Low iodine leads to low T3/T4 $\rightarrow$ High [[TSH]] $\rightarrow$ Hyperplasia.
2.  **Goitrogens**: Substances that inhibit hormone synthesis.
    *   *Dietary*: Cabbage, kale, rape, cassava, soybean.
    *   *Drugs*: PAS, sulfonylureas, lithium, amiodarone.
3.  **Dyshormonogenesis**: Congenital enzyme defects (e.g., peroxidase deficiency).
4.  **Autoimmunity**:
    *   **Graves’ Disease**: [[TSH receptor antibodies]] (stimulatory).
    *   **Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis**: Anti-TPO and Anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (destructive).
5.  **Physiological Stress**: Increased demand during puberty and pregnancy.

### Clinical Features

#### 1. Symptoms
*   **Swelling**: Progressive lump in the front of the neck.
*   **Pressure Symptoms**:
    *   *Trachea*: Dyspnea, stridor (especially in retrosternal goiter).
    *   *Esophagus*: [[Dysphagia]] (rare, usually requires malignant infiltration).
    *   *Nerves*: Hoarseness of voice (suggests malignancy involving [[Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve]]).
*   **Functional Symptoms**:
    *   *Hypothyroidism*: Weight gain, lethargy, cold intolerance, dry skin.
    *   *Hyperthyroidism*: Palpitations, tremors, weight loss, heat intolerance, sweating.

#### 2. Signs
*   **Inspection**: Swelling moves up with swallowing.
*   **Palpation**:
    *   **Methods**: [[Lahey’s method]] (from front), Pizzillo’s method (neck extended against hands behind head).
    *   **Consistency**: Soft (colloid), Firm (adenoma/simple goiter), Hard (carcinoma, Riedel's thyroiditis, calcification).
    *   **Surface**: Smooth (Graves', colloid) or Nodular (MNG).
*   **Auscultation**: **Thyroid Bruit** (systolic) seen in [[Graves’ disease]] due to increased vascularity (superior pole).

#### 3. Specific Named Signs
*   **[[Pemberton’s Sign]]**: Used to detect retrosternal extension.
    *   *Method*: Patient raises both arms above the head until they touch the ears.
    *   *Positive result*: Facial congestion, cyanosis, and respiratory distress within 1 minute due to compression of internal jugular veins at the thoracic inlet ("cork in the bottle" effect).
*   **[[Kocher’s Test]]**: Slight lateral pressure on the lobes produces stridor (indicates scabbard trachea/tracheomalacia).
*   **[[Berry’s Sign]]**: Absence of carotid pulsation on palpation (indicates malignancy encasing the carotid sheath).

### Evaluation of Thyroid Nodule/Goiter

#### 1. Thyroid Function Tests (TFT)
*   **[[TSH]]**: Most sensitive screening test.
    *   *Suppressed*: Hyperthyroidism.
    *   *Elevated*: Hypothyroidism.
*   **Free T3 and T4**: More accurate than total levels as they are biologically active.
*   **Calcitonin**: Marker for [[Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma]].
*   **Thyroglobulin**: Post-operative marker for recurrence in differentiated thyroid cancer.

#### 2. Imaging
*   **Ultrasound (USG) Neck**:
    *   Differentiates Cystic vs. Solid.
    *   Identifies multiple nodules in clinically solitary cases.
    *   *Malignancy features*: Hypoechoic, irregular margins, microcalcifications, taller-than-wide shape, absent halo.
*   **X-ray Neck/Chest**:
    *   Tracheal deviation/compression.
    *   Retrosternal extension.
    *   Calcification (Psammoma bodies = Papillary Ca; Eggshell = Benign).
*   **Radioisotope Scan (Scintigraphy)**:
    *   Uses Technetium-99m or Iodine-123.
    *   **Hot Nodule**: Hyperfunctioning (rarely malignant).
    *   **Cold Nodule**: Non-functioning (10-20% risk of malignancy).

#### 3. Pathology
*   **[[Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology]] (FNAC)**:
    *   **Gold Standard** investigation for discrete thyroid nodules.
    *   Can distinguish benign vs. malignant (except Follicular Adenoma vs. Carcinoma, which requires biopsy/histopathology).
    *   **Bethesda System** is used for reporting.

**Mnemonic for Malignancy Risk in Nodule**
**"HALO"**
*   **H**: Hard consistency
*   **A**: Age (<20 or >60 years)
*   **L**: Lymphadenopathy
*   **O**: Obstruction (Dysphagia/Dyspnea)

### Management

#### 1. Medical Management
*   **Simple Goiter**: Iodine supplementation (if deficiency).
*   **Hypothyroidism**: Levothyroxine replacement.
*   **Hyperthyroidism (Graves')**:
    *   Antithyroid drugs (Carbimazole, Methimazole, Propylthiouracil).
    *   Beta-blockers (Propranolol) for symptoms.
*   **Suppressive Therapy**: Thyroxine to suppress TSH and shrink nodule (Controversial efficacy).

#### 2. Radioactive Iodine (RAI)
*   Used for hyperthyroidism (Graves', Toxic nodule) and post-operative ablation in differentiated thyroid cancer.
*   Contraindicated in pregnancy.

#### 3. Surgical Management
**Indications for Surgery**:
1.  **Malignancy**: Proven or suspicious on FNAC.
2.  **Pressure Symptoms**: Dyspnea, dysphagia, stridor.
3.  **Retrosternal Goiter**: Risk of acute airway obstruction.
4.  **Cosmetic**: Large unsightly goiters.
5.  **Toxic Goiter**: Failed medical therapy or patient preference.

**Types of Thyroid Surgery**:

| Procedure | Description | Indication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hemithyroidectomy** | Removal of one lobe + isthmus | Benign solitary nodule, T1/T2 papillary Ca |
| **Subtotal Thyroidectomy** | Bilateral removal leaving 3g tissue on each side | Toxic MNG, Graves' (Historically used) |
| **Near-Total Thyroidectomy** | Total removal of one lobe + isthmus + 90% of other lobe | To protect parathyroid/RLN on one side |
| **Total Thyroidectomy** | Removal of both lobes and isthmus | Malignancy, MNG involving both lobes |

### Complications of Thyroid Surgery
*   **Immediate**:
    *   **Hemorrhage**: Can cause tension hematoma and airway obstruction. Needs immediate evacuation.
    *   **Respiratory Obstruction**: Due to laryngeal edema, tracheomalacia, or bilateral cord palsy.
*   **Nerve Injury**:
    *   **[[Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve]] (RLN)**:
        *   *Unilateral*: Hoarseness (cord in paramedian position).
        *   *Bilateral*: Airway obstruction/Stridor (cords in paramedian position) $\rightarrow$ Requires Tracheostomy.
    *   **[[External Laryngeal Nerve]]**: Paralysis of cricothyroid muscle $\rightarrow$ inability to hit high notes/voice fatigue.
*   **Metabolic**:
    *   **Hypoparathyroidism**: Due to removal or devascularization of [[Parathyroid glands]]. Causes **Hypocalcemia** (Tetany, Chvostek's sign, Trousseau's sign).
    *   **Hypothyroidism**: Permanent after total thyroidectomy.
    *   **Thyroid Storm**: In inadequately prepared toxic patients.
