# [[General Orthopaedics]] > Physiology of Bone Formation and Remodeling

### Bone Composition and Structure

Bone is a specialized connective tissue that provides structural support, protection for vital organs, and serves as a mineral reservoir (specifically for [[Calcium]] and [[Phosphate]]). It consists of an organic matrix reinforced by inorganic mineral salts.

#### 1. Bone Matrix
The extracellular matrix determines the mechanical properties of the bone.

*   **Inorganic Component (65–70%):**
    *   Primarily **calcium hydroxyapatite** $[Ca_{10}(PO_4)_6(OH)_2]$.
    *   Provides the bone with hardness and compressive strength.
    *   Contains about 99% of the body's calcium.
*   **Organic Component (30–35%):**
    *   **Type I Collagen** (90–95% of organic matrix): Provides tensile strength.
    *   **Mucopolysaccharides (Proteoglycans):** Ground substance (e.g., chondroitin sulphate).
    *   **Non-collagenous proteins:** [[Osteonectin]], [[Osteocalcin]].

#### 2. Bone Cells
There are four primary cell types responsible for bone physiology:

| Cell Type | Origin | Function | Key Enzyme/Marker |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Osteoblast]]** | Mesenchymal precursors (Osteoprogenitor) | **Bone Formation.** Lays down organic matrix (osteoid) and regulates mineralization. | [[Alkaline Phosphatase]] (ALP) |
| **[[Osteocyte]]** | Mature Osteoblast trapped in matrix | **Maintenance.** Communicates mechanical stress/strain to other cells via canaliculi. | - |
| **[[Osteoclast]]** | Monocyte/Macrophage lineage | **Bone Resorption.** Multinucleated giant cells that break down bone matrix. | [[Tartrate Resistant Acid Phosphatase]] (TRAP) |
| **[[Osteoprogenitor Cell]]** | Mesenchyme | Stem cells that differentiate into osteoblasts or chondroblasts. | - |

**Mnemonic for Cell Function:**
*   **B**lasts **B**uild bone.
*   **C**lasts **C**rush (resorb) bone.
*   **Cy**tes **Si**t inside the bone.

### Structural Types of Bone tissue

#### Macroscopic Structure
*   **[[Cortical Bone]] (Compact Bone):** Forms the hard outer shell (cortex). It is dense and provides strength for weight-bearing. It makes up 80% of the skeletal mass.
*   **[[Cancellous Bone]] (Trabecular/Spongy Bone):** Found in the interior (medulla), specifically at the ends of long bones (metaphysis/epiphysis) and in vertebral bodies. It has a honeycomb lattice structure organized along lines of stress.

#### Microscopic Structure
*   **Woven Bone (Immature):** Characterized by haphazardly arranged collagen fibers. It is weak and mechanically inefficient. It is seen in the embryonic skeleton and during early **fracture healing** (callus).
*   **Lamellar Bone (Mature):** Characterized by parallel collagen fibers arranged in sheets. It is mechanically strong and replaces woven bone.
    *   **[[Osteon]] (Haversian System):** The basic structural unit of cortical bone. It consists of concentric lamellae surrounding a central **Haversian canal** (containing blood vessels). These are interconnected by transverse **Volkmann's canals**.

### Physiology of Bone Formation (Ossification)

Bone formation occurs through two distinct processes:

1.  **[[Intramembranous Ossification]]:**
    *   Direct formation of bone from condensed mesenchymal cells without a cartilage model.
    *   Occurs in flat bones (e.g., skull, clavicle).
2.  **[[Endochondral Ossification]]:**
    *   Bone replaces a pre-existing hyaline [[cartilage]] model.
    *   Chondrocytes proliferate, hypertrophy, and secrete alkaline phosphatase, leading to calcification of the matrix and subsequent replacement by bone.
    *   Occurs in long bones and at the **[[Physis]] (Growth Plate)** allowing longitudinal growth.

**Mineralization Process:**
[[Osteoblasts]] secrete alkaline phosphatase, which increases local concentrations of phosphate ions. This causes calcium and phosphate to precipitate as calcium hydroxyapatite crystals onto the collagen matrix.

### Physiology of Bone Remodeling

Bone is in a continuous state of flux, constantly being removed and replaced. This process, called remodeling, occurs at the periosteal, endosteal, and Haversian surfaces.

#### The Remodeling Cycle
This is a coupled process involving the interaction of osteoclasts and osteoblasts:
1.  **Activation:** Osteoclasts are recruited to a specific site.
2.  **Resorption:** [[Osteoclasts]] anchor to the bone surface, create a sealed zone, and secrete acid and proteolytic enzymes to dissolve mineral and matrix (creation of Howship's lacunae or cutting cones).
3.  **Reversal:** Resorption stops, and osteoclasts undergo apoptosis.
4.  **Formation:** [[Osteoblasts]] are attracted to the site and lay down new osteoid (unmineralized matrix).
5.  **Mineralization:** The osteoid is mineralized to form mature bone.

#### Wolff's Law
Bone remodeling is regulated by mechanical stress. **[[Wolff's Law]]** states that bone remodels in response to the loads placed upon it. Trabeculae thicken and align along trajectories of compressive and tensile stress to provide maximum strength with minimum mass.

### Regulation of Bone Metabolism

Bone acts as a reservoir for calcium, maintaining serum levels critical for neuromuscular function and coagulation.

#### Hormonal Control
*   **[[Parathyroid Hormone]] (PTH):**
    *   Secreted in response to *low* serum calcium.
    *   Stimulates osteoclastic resorption (releasing Ca into blood).
    *   Increases renal reabsorption of Ca and intestinal absorption (via Vit D).
*   **[[Vitamin D]] (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol):**
    *   Essential for mineralization of osteoid.
    *   Increases calcium and phosphate absorption from the gut.
*   **[[Calcitonin]]:**
    *   Secreted by thyroid C-cells in response to *high* serum calcium.
    *   Inhibits osteoclastic resorption (minor role in adults).

#### Bone Turnover Markers
These are clinically useful for assessing metabolic bone diseases (e.g., Osteoporosis, Paget's disease).

| Markers of Bone Formation (Osteoblast Activity) | Markers of Bone Resorption (Osteoclast Activity) |
| :--- | :--- |
| [[Serum Alkaline Phosphatase]] (ALP) | Urinary [[Hydroxyproline]] |
| [[Osteocalcin]] | Urinary [[Hydroxylysine]] |
| [[Procollagen]] (PINP) | [[Tartrate Resistant Acid Phosphatase]] (TRAP) |
| [[Osteonectin]] | N-Telopeptide (NTX) / C-Telopeptide (CTX) |

### Clinical Implications

*   **[[Osteoporosis]]:** A quantitative defect where bone mass decreases (resorption > formation), but the mineral-to-matrix ratio remains normal. This leads to porous, brittle bones.
*   **[[Osteomalacia]] / [[Rickets]]:** A qualitative defect where the organic matrix (osteoid) fails to mineralize properly, usually due to Vitamin D deficiency. This leads to soft bones.
*   **[[Paget's Disease]] (Osteitis Deformans):** Disordered remodeling characterized by excessive resorption followed by chaotic, excessive formation of weak, woven bone.
*   **[[Fracture Healing]]:** The body's response to injury involves inflammation, soft callus formation (cartilage/woven bone), hard callus formation, and finally remodeling to restore original structure.
