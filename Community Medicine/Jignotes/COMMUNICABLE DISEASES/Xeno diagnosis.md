# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Xeno diagnosis

### **Xenodiagnosis**

**Definition**
[[Xenodiagnosis]] is a specialized diagnostic method used in communicable diseases where a natural vector (usually an insect/arthropod) is employed to detect the presence of a parasite in a human host, particularly when the parasite density is too low to be detected by conventional blood smears.

**Principle**
The technique relies on the **biological amplification** of the parasite within its natural intermediate host (the vector). Even if the parasite count in the human blood is negligible, the vector can ingest the parasite, allowing it to multiply or develop into a visible stage during the incubation period.

**Procedure**
1.  **Selection:** Laboratory-bred, **infection-free** vectors (e.g., [[mosquitoes]]) are selected to ensure they are not already carrying the disease.
2.  **Feeding:** These vectors are allowed to feed on the suspected patient (take a blood meal).
3.  **Incubation:** The vectors are kept alive for a specific period (usually **2 weeks**) to allow the parasite to develop within them.
4.  **Examination:** The vectors are dissected and examined microscopically to demonstrate the presence of the infection (e.g., infective larvae).

**Clinical Indications**
*   **[[Lymphatic Filariasis]]:** This is the primary indication in the Indian context. It is used when:
    *   [[Microfilaremia]] is strongly suspected clinically.
    *   Routine night blood examinations are **repeatedly negative**.
*   **Low Density Infection:** It succeeds in detecting **[[low-density microfilaraemia]]** where other standard techniques (like thick blood film) fail.

**Advantages and Limitations**
*   **Advantage:** High sensitivity for detecting latent or low-level infections.
*   **Limitation:** It is a slow process (results take weeks), cumbersome to maintain vector colonies, and generally reserved for research or difficult diagnostic cases rather than routine clinical practice.
