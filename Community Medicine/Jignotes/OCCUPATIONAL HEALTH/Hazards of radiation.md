# [[OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH]] > Hazards of radiation

# Hazards of Radiation in Occupational Health

Radiation hazards in the workplace stem from exposure to [[Ionizing radiation]] (X-rays, gamma rays) and [[Non-ionizing radiation]] (UV rays, infrared). The effects depend on the dose, duration of exposure, and the specific tissue involved.

### Sources of Occupational Exposure

Occupational exposure occurs in various industries involving radioactive substances or radiation-generating equipment:
*   **Medical & Dental:** Radiologists, technicians, and dentists exposed to [[X-rays]] and radioisotopes.
*   **Mining:** Workers in uranium mines or monazite sand workers (inhalation of radioactive dust).
*   **Industrial:**
    *   Luminous dial painting (Radium).
    *   Atomic energy plants and nuclear reactors.
    *   Industrial radiography (detecting flaws in metals).
    *   Welding (exposure to [[Ultraviolet radiation]]).

### Types of Radiation

| Type | Examples | Penetration Power | Hazard Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ionizing** | X-rays, Gamma rays | **Deep** (Internal organs) | Systemic damage, [[Leukemia]], Genetic mutations |
| | Alpha particles | Low (Surface) | Dangerous if inhaled/ingested |
| | Beta particles | Moderate (Skin) | Skin burns, superficial damage |
| **Non-Ionizing** | Ultraviolet (UV) | Surface | [[Conjunctivitis]], Keratitis ("Welder's flash") |
| | Infrared (IR) | Surface | [[Cataract]] (Glass blower's cataract) |

### Biological Effects of Radiation

The biological effects are classified into **Somatic** (affecting the individual) and **Genetic** (affecting offspring).

#### 1. Somatic Effects
These effects appear in the exposed individual either immediately or after a latent period.

**A. Immediate (Acute) Effects:**
Occur following massive doses (e.g., nuclear accidents).
*   **Acute Radiation Syndrome:** Characterized by nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite within hours.
*   **Skin:** Erythema, burns, dermatitis, and epilation (hair loss).
*   **Blood:** [[Blood dyscrasias]] (drop in blood cell counts), increased susceptibility to infections due to bone marrow depression.
*   **CNS:** In extreme doses, death occurs due to CNS failure.

**B. Delayed (Chronic) Effects:**
Occur due to prolonged exposure to low doses over months/years.
*   **Malignancy:**
    *   [[Leukemia]] (most common radiation-induced malignancy).
    *   Skin cancer (Epidermoid carcinoma).
    *   Lung cancer (common in uranium miners).
    *   Bone cancer (Osteosarcoma).
*   **Ocular:** [[Cataract]] (specifically posterior subcapsular cataract) caused by neutrons or IR rays.
*   **Reproductive:** Sterility (permanent or temporary) and fetal malformations if exposed during pregnancy.
*   **Others:** Aplastic anemia, shortening of life span.

#### 2. Genetic Effects
These result from damage to the chromosomes and genes in the germ cells.
*   **Mutations:** Chromosomal mutations and point mutations.
*   These defects are **recessive** and may not manifest in the immediate generation but affect future generations.
*    Consequences include sterility or hereditary defects in offspring.

**Clinical Relevance:** There is **no safe threshold** for genetic damage; even minimal radiation can potentially cause mutations.

### Tissue Sensitivity to Radiation

Not all body tissues react the same way. Rapidly dividing cells are most sensitive.

**Order of Sensitivity (High to Low):**
1.  **Lymphocytes** (Most sensitive) and WBCs.
2.  **Bone Marrow** (Blood-forming organs).
3.  **Gonads** (Testis/Ovary).
4.  Skin and Mucosa.
5.  Liver, Kidney, Muscle.
6.  **Nerve cells** (Least sensitive).

> **Mnemonic for Sensitive Tissues:** **L**ittle **G**uys **B**reak **S**lowly
> *   **L** - Lymphocytes
> *   **G** - Gonads
> *   **B** - Bone Marrow
> *   **S** - Skin

### Prevention and Control

The International Commission on Radiological Protection (**ICRP**) sets the Maximum Permissible Dose.
*   **Occupational Limit:** 5 rem (50 mSv) per year.
*   **General Public Limit:** 0.5 rem (5 mSv) per year.

#### Principles of Protection (The "STD" Rule)
1.  **S**hielding: Use lead aprons, lead-lined walls, and concrete barriers. Lead blocks X-rays and Gamma rays.
2.  **T**ime: Reduce the duration of exposure. Rotate workers to minimize individual dose.
3.  **D**istance: Intensity of radiation decreases inversely with the square of the distance (**Inverse Square Law**). Use long forceps for radioactive needles; stay as far as possible from the source.

#### Additional Measures:
*   **Monitoring:** All workers must wear a [[Film Badge]] or dosimeter to track cumulative exposure.
*   **Ventilation:** Adequate exhaust systems to remove radioactive dust/gas.
*   **Hygiene:** Wet mopping (no dry sweeping) to prevent inhaling radioactive dust. No eating/drinking in workrooms.
*   **Medical Surveillance:**
    *   **Pre-placement:** Complete blood count (CBC) to rule out pre-existing blood disorders.
    *   **Periodic:** Regular check-ups every 2 months. Pregnant women should **not** work in continuous exposure areas.
