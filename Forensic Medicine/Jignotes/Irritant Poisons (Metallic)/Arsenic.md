# Arsenic Poisoning

Arsenic is a metallic irritant poison, historically known as the **"King of Poisons"** or **"Inheritance Powder"** because it was frequently used to eliminate wealthy relatives. It is a metalloid that is tasteless, odorless, and colorless in solution, making it a potent weapon for homicide.

The most common toxic compound is [[Arsenic Trioxide]] (As₂O₃), also known as *Sankhya*, *Somalkhar*, or White Arsenic.

### Mechanism of Action
1.  **Enzyme Inhibition:** Arsenic combines with the **sulfhydryl (-SH) groups** of mitochondrial enzymes (specifically pyruvate oxidase), interfering with cellular respiration and metabolism,.
2.  **Capillary Paralysis:** It causes paralysis of the capillaries, leading to dilatation, increased permeability, and transudation of plasma. This results in shock and "rice-water" stools.
3.  **Uncoupling:** Arsenate uncouples mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.

### Acute Arsenic Poisoning

Acute poisoning manifests in three clinical forms:

#### 1. Gastro-enteric Type (Most Common)
Symptoms resemble bacterial food poisoning or cholera.
*   **Onset:** Usually 30 minutes to 1 hour after ingestion.
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Throat:** Burning sensation in the throat, difficulty swallowing.
    *   **Stomach:** Intense burning (fire-like) pain in the epigastrium, followed by projectile vomiting.
    *   **Stools:** Profuse, watery diarrhea causing **"Rice-water stools"** (due to mucosal shedding) which may become bloody.
    *   **Dehydration:** Excessive fluid loss leads to intense thirst, muscle cramps, sunken eyes, and oliguria (suppressed urine).
    *   **CV System:** Hypotension, feeble pulse, and cardiovascular collapse (Shock).

#### 2. Fulminant (Narcotic) Type
*   Seen when massive doses (3–5g) are absorbed rapidly.
*   **Feature:** Death occurs rapidly (1–3 hours) due to profound **shock** and peripheral vascular failure.
*   **Key Distinction:** Gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting/diarrhea) are noticeably **absent** or minimal.

#### 3. Narcotic Form
*   Rare. Characterized by delirium, coma, and rapid death, resembling opioid poisoning.

#### Differential Diagnosis: Arsenic vs. Cholera
This is a classic exam question.

| Feature | Acute Arsenic Poisoning | Cholera |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Throat** | Burning sensation/pain present | Not affected |
| **Vomiting** | **Precedes** diarrhea (usually) | Follows diarrhea |
| **Vomit Content** | Mucoid, bloody, or bile-stained | Watery |
| **Stool** | Rice-water, bloody, or mucoid | Rice-water only |
| **Tenesmus** | Present (pain around anus) | Absent |
| **Conjunctiva** | Inflamed/congested | Not inflamed |
| **Voice** | Hoarse | Weak/whispering |
| **Lab Findings** | Arsenic in urine/vomit | *Vibrio cholerae* in stool |

### Chronic Arsenic Poisoning ([[Arsenicosis]])

Caused by repeated small doses (homicidal) or environmental exposure (contaminated groundwater). The classical presentation involves four stages:

1.  **Nutritional/GI Stage:** Loss of appetite, nausea, and gradual weight loss (emaciation).
2.  **Catarrhal Stage:** Symptoms resembling a cold—running nose, coughing, inflamed eyes (conjunctivitis), and bronchial irritation.
3.  **Cutaneous (Skin) Stage:**
    *   **Raindrop Pigmentation:** Mottled brown pigmentation (melanosis) typically on the temples, eyelids, and neck.
    *   **Hyperkeratosis:** Thickening of skin on palms and soles (cracked/warty appearance).
    *   **[[Aldrich-Mees Lines]]:** Transverse white bands on fingernails. They appear 3–6 weeks after exposure and move distally with nail growth.
4.  **Nervous Stage:**
    *   **Polyneuropathy:** Tingling, numbness, and "pins and needles" sensation (paresthesia) in hands and feet.
    *   **Motor paralysis:** Wrist drop or foot drop (less common than in Lead poisoning).

**Other Chronic Effects:**
*   **Blackfoot Disease:** Peripheral vascular disease leading to gangrene of the extremities (specifically toes/feet).
*   **Carcinogenicity:** Chronic exposure is linked to skin, lung, and bladder cancers.

> **Mnemonic for Chronic Arsenic:** **"Rain drops on the Road, Lines on the Nail"**
> *   **Rain drops:** Raindrop pigmentation on skin.
> *   **Road:** Hyperkeratosis (rough skin like a road).
> *   **Lines:** Aldrich-Mees lines on nails.

### Fatal Dose and Period
*   **Fatal Dose:** **0.1 to 0.2 gm** (100–200 mg) of Arsenic Trioxide,.
*   **Fatal Period:** **1 to 2 days** (24–48 hours).

---

### Treatment

**1. Decontamination:**
*   **Emesis:** Can be induced if the patient is alert.
*   **[[Gastric Lavage]]:** Thorough wash with warm water.
*   **Chemical Antidote:** **Freshly precipitated hydrated ferric oxide**. It converts toxic arsenious acid into insoluble ferric arsenite,. If unavailable, use charcoal.

**2. Chelation Therapy (Specific Antidotes):**
*   **[[BAL]] (British Anti-Lewisite/Dimercaprol):** The traditional antidote. Dose: 3–5 mg/kg IM every 4 hours for 2 days, then tapered. It has a foul smell and is painful.
*   **D-Penicillamine:** Oral chelating agent.
*   **[[DMSA]] (Succimer):** An oral analogue of BAL; effective and less toxic than BAL.

**3. Symptomatic:**
*   IV fluids for shock and dehydration (crucial).
*   Morphine for pain.
*   Hemodialysis in renal failure.

### Autopsy Findings

**External:**
*   Dehydration features: Sunken eyeballs, wrinkled skin.
*   Cyanosis of extremities.

**Internal:**
*   **Stomach:** The most characteristic finding is the **"Red Velvety Mucosa"**. The gastric mucosa is swollen, edematous, and deep crimson red.
*   **Hemorrhage:** Submucosal petechial hemorrhages are seen.
*   **Particles:** White or yellow particles of arsenic may be found embedded in the sticky mucus covering the stomach wall,.
*   **Heart:** **[[Subendocardial Hemorrhages]]** (flame-shaped) in the left ventricle are a consistent finding.
*   **Putrefaction:** Arsenic delays decomposition (it acts as a preservative), so the body may be surprisingly well-preserved.

### Medico-Legal Aspects

1.  **Ideal Homicidal Poison:**
    *   It is cheap, easily available, tasteless, and odorless.
    *   Small fatal dose.
    *   Can be administered in food/drink without detection (though it may feel gritty).
    *   Symptoms mimic natural diseases like cholera (acute) or gradual decline (chronic).
2.  **Cattle Poisoning:** Used to kill cattle.
3.  **Preservation:** Because it retards putrefaction, arsenic poisoning can be detected even in exhumed bodies years later (found in bones, hair, and soil around the coffin).
4.  **Samples:** In chronic cases or exhumation, **Hair** (plucked with roots), **Nails**, and **Long Bones** (femur) must be preserved for analysis as arsenic deposits in keratinized tissue.
