### **National Immunization Schedule (NIS) for Under-Five Children**

The [[National Immunization Schedule]] under the Universal Immunization Programme ([[UIP]]) protects children against vaccine-preventable diseases.

> Timeline of vaccination from birth to 5 years

***Note:** JE vaccine is given only in endemic districts. Vitamin A is continued every 6 months (2 ml) until 5 years of age (Total 9 doses).*,,,,,,,

### **What is Cold Chain?**

The **[[Cold Chain]]** is a system of storage and transport of vaccines at low temperatures from the manufacturer to the actual vaccination site,.

*   **Objective:** To maintain the potency of vaccines, as heat or freezing can damage them (Vaccine Failure),.
*   **Temperature Range:** Generally **+2°C to +8°C** for most vaccines at the health center level,.
    *   **Exception:** [[OPV]] requires **-15°C to -25°C** (Deep Freezer) for long-term storage but can be kept at +2°C to +8°C for immediate use,.
*   **Components:**
    1.  **Personnel:** To manage distribution.
    2.  **Equipment:** [[Walk-in-Coolers]] (WIC), [[Deep Freezers]], [[Ice Lined Refrigerators]] (ILR), [[Cold Boxes]], and [[Vaccine Carriers]].
    3.  **Procedures:** Guidelines to ensure temperature maintenance.

**Clinical Relevance:** The **[[Ice Lined Refrigerator]] (ILR)** is the most important component of the cold chain at the PHC/District level because it can hold temperature even with intermittent electricity,.

### **Handling a Vaccine Carrier: Dos and Don'ts**

A **[[Vaccine Carrier]]** is used to carry small quantities of vaccines (16-20 vials) to outreach sessions (Sub-centers/Villages) and can maintain temperature for 48-72 hours,,.

#### **Dos (✅)**
*   **Use [[Conditioned Ice Packs]]:** Always use 4 fully frozen ice packs that have been "conditioned" (kept at room temperature until they sweat and water is heard shaking inside) to prevent freezing of sensitive vaccines,.
*   **Close Tightly:** Keep the lid tightly closed when not in use to maintain the internal temperature.
*   **Zipper Bag:** Keep vaccines and diluents in a plastic zipper bag in the center of the carrier.
*   **Diluents:** Ensure diluents (e.g., for BCG/Measles) are also cooled to +2 to +8°C before reconstitution.
*   **During Session:** Take one ice pack out and place the reconstituted [[BCG]] or [[Measles]] vial in the holes/wells of the ice pack to keep them cool and stable.

#### **Don'ts (❌)**
*   **Direct Contact:** **NEVER** place freeze-sensitive vaccines ([[T-series]]: DPT, TT, Pentavalent, Hep B, PCV, IPV) in direct contact with the ice packs. They will freeze and lose potency,,.
*   **Sunlight:** Do not leave the vaccine carrier in direct sunlight,.
*   **Sit/Drop:** Do not drop or sit on the vaccine carrier as it damages the insulation.
*   **Water:** Do not allow water to accumulate at the bottom of the carrier.
*   **Open Lid:** Do not leave the lid open unnecessarily during the session.
