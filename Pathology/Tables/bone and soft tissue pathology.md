| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) / Brittle Bone Disease** A group of hereditary disorders caused by defects in type I collagen synthesis, resulting in extreme skeletal fragility. | Inherited genetic disorder of connective tissue. | - | Defects in type I collagen synthesis lead to deficient bone quantity. Mutations cause misfolding of collagen polypeptides and defective assembly of higher-order chains. Mutant collagens can exert a **dominant negative effect**, interfering with wild-type chains. The fundamental abnormality is 'too little bone'. | Mutations in **COL1A1** and **COL1A2** genes, which encode the α1 and α2 chains of type I collagen. Many mutations involve the replacement of a glycine residue. | - | - | Extreme skeletal fragility with multiple fractures, **blue sclerae** (due to translucency revealing the choroid), hearing loss (sensorineural and conductive), and dental imperfections (dentin deficiency). | - | **Type I:** Mildest form, compatible with normal life span. **Type II:** Uniformly fatal in utero or perinatally. **Type III:** Progressive, deforming. **Type IV:** Moderately severe. | Multiple fractures, sometimes intrauterine. Joint laxity. Progressive kyphoscoliosis. | - |
| **Osteopetrosis** A group of rare genetic diseases characterized by reduced bone resorption due to deficient osteoclast function, leading to diffuse, symmetric skeletal sclerosis ("stone bone"). | Genetic disease due to impaired osteoclast development or function. | - | Deficient osteoclast activity prevents bone remodeling. The primary spongiosa, normally removed during growth, persists and fills the medullary cavity. Most mutations interfere with the **acidification of the osteoclast resorption pit**, which is needed to dissolve calcium hydroxyapatite. Some mutations (e.g., in IKBKG) affect osteoclastogenesis. | **CLCN7:** Encodes a proton-chloride exchanger. Mutation causes mild autosomal dominant form (Albers-Schönberg disease). **TCIRG1:** Encodes a subunit of the H+-ATPase pump. Mutation causes most severe autosomal recessive cases. **CA2:** Carbonic anhydrase 2. Mutation also leads to renal tubular acidosis. **IKBKG (NEMO):** X-linked, required for NF-κB activation and osteoclast survival. | Bones lack a medullary canal. Ends of long bones are bulbous (**Erlenmeyer flask deformity**) and misshapen. | Primary spongiosa fills the medullary cavity, displacing hematopoietic marrow. Deposited bone is woven rather than lamellar. Osteoclasts may be normal, increased, or decreased in number. | Bones are brittle and fracture easily. Cranial nerve defects (optic atrophy, deafness, facial paralysis) from nerve compression in small foramina. Hepatosplenomegaly from extramedullary hematopoiesis. | Radiographs show diffusely sclerotic bones, lack of medullary canal, and Erlenmeyer flask deformity. | **Autosomal recessive (infantile):** Severe, evident in utero or soon after birth. **Autosomal dominant (adult):** Milder, detected in adolescence or adulthood. | Fractures, anemia, leukopenia (leading to repeated infections), hydrocephaly, renal tubular acidosis (in CA2 mutation). | Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is effective as osteoclasts are derived from these precursors. |
| **Mucopolysaccharidoses** Lysosomal storage diseases caused by deficiencies in enzymes that degrade mucopolysaccharides (dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, keratan sulfate). | Genetic deficiencies in lysosomal enzymes (acid hydrolases). | - | Enzyme deficiencies lead to accumulation of mucopolysaccharides within mesenchymal cells, particularly chondrocytes. This induces apoptosis and leads to structural defects in articular cartilage, cartilage anlage, growth plates, and costal cartilages. | - | Malformed bones. | - | Short stature, chest wall abnormalities. | - | - | - | - |
| **Osteoporosis** A condition of decreased bone mass (osteopenia) severe enough to significantly increase the risk of fracture. Bone mass is >= 2.5 SD below mean peak bone mass. | Imbalance between bone resorption and formation, leading to net bone loss. | Post-menopause (estrogen deficiency), aging (senile), reduced physical activity, calcium/vitamin D deficiency, genetics, various endocrine disorders and medications (corticosteroids). | **Postmenopausal:** Decreased estrogen leads to increased levels of cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF), which increases RANKL expression and decreases OPG. This stimulates osteoclast recruitment and activity, resulting in high-turnover osteoporosis. **Senile:** Age-related changes lead to reduced proliferative and synthetic capacity of osteoblasts. This results in low-turnover osteoporosis. Reduced physical activity exacerbates bone loss. | Polymorphisms in genes such as **RANK**, **RANKL**, **OPG**, HLA locus, and estrogen receptor gene contribute to variation in peak bone density. | Loss of bone mass is most prominent in bones with high surface area, like vertebral bodies. | Histologically normal bone that is decreased in quantity. Trabecular plates become thinned and perforated, losing their interconnections. In senile osteoporosis, the cortex is thinned, and Haversian systems are widened. | Often asymptomatic until a fracture occurs. Vertebral fractures can cause pain, loss of height, lumbar lordosis, and kyphoscoliosis. | Cannot be reliably detected on plain radiographs until 30-40% of bone mass is lost. Diagnosis is by measuring bone density via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) or quantitative CT. | **Primary:** Postmenopausal, Senile, Idiopathic. **Secondary:** Due to endocrine disorders, drugs, GI issues, etc. | Fractures (femoral neck, pelvis, spine). Complications of immobilization like pulmonary embolism and pneumonia. | Exercise, calcium and vitamin D intake. Pharmacologic agents include bisphosphonates (reduce osteoclast activity), denosumab (anti-RANKL antibody), selective estrogen receptor modulators. |
| **Rickets** The disorder in children in which impaired mineralization of bone matrix interferes with bone deposition in the growth plates. | Vitamin D deficiency or abnormal vitamin D metabolism. | - | Defective mineralization of bone matrix, particularly at the growth plates, leading to skeletal deformities. The adult counterpart is osteomalacia. | - | - | Undermineralized bone matrix (osteoid). | - | - | - | - | - |
| **Hyperparathyroidism (Skeletal Manifestations)** Skeletal changes resulting from excessive parathyroid hormone (PTH), leading to increased bone resorption. | Primary hyperparathyroidism (autonomous PTH secretion) or secondary hyperparathyroidism (e.g., due to renal disease). | - | Elevated PTH increases RANKL expression on osteoblasts, leading to increased osteoclast activity and bone resorption. Osteoclasts tunnel into and dissect along trabeculae (**dissecting osteitis**). Microfractures and hemorrhage lead to an influx of macrophages and fibrous tissue, forming a 'brown tumor'. | - | Mass lesion called a **brown tumor**, which is brown due to vascularity, hemorrhage, and hemosiderin. May have cystic degeneration. | Increased osteoclast activity, especially in cortical bone. **Dissecting osteitis:** osteoclasts tunneling along trabeculae. Marrow spaces replaced by fibrovascular tissue. Brown tumors show hemorrhage, macrophage recruitment, and reparative fibrous tissue. The combination is called **generalized osteitis fibrosa cystica (von Recklinghausen disease of bone)**. | Usually diagnosed early by routine blood tests and is asymptomatic. If symptomatic, can cause bone pain, fractures, and deformation. | Elevated serum PTH, elevated serum calcium (in primary). | **Primary:** Autonomous parathyroid secretion. **Secondary:** Compensatory secretion due to conditions like chronic renal failure. | Osteoporosis, brown tumors, and osteitis fibrosa cystica. Fractures, bone deformation. | Control of the underlying cause of hyperparathyroidism. |
| **Renal Osteodystrophy** The collective skeletal changes that occur in chronic renal disease. | Chronic renal disease and its treatment (dialysis). | End-stage renal failure. | Multiple mechanisms: 1. **Tubular dysfunction** -> metabolic acidosis -> matrix demineralization (osteomalacia). 2. **Secondary hyperparathyroidism** -> reduced phosphate excretion and hypocalcemia stimulate PTH -> bone resorption. 3. **Decreased biosynthetic function** -> reduced active vitamin D3 -> hypocalcemia -> worsens hyperparathyroidism. Disruption of the FGF-23/Klotho axis also contributes. | - | - | A combination of osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and osteitis fibrosa cystica. | - | - | **High-turnover osteodystrophy:** Increased resorption and formation (resorption predominates). **Low-turnover/aplastic disease:** Adynamic bone or osteomalacia. **Mixed pattern disease:** Areas of high and low turnover. | Osteopenia/osteoporosis, osteomalacia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, growth retardation. | - |
| **Paget Disease (Osteitis Deformans)** A disorder of increased, but disordered and structurally unsound, bone mass. | Uncertain. Both genetic and environmental (viral) factors are implicated. | Increasing age (>40 years), Caucasian race, geographic locations (England, US, Australia). Familial history. | Sequential phases: 1. **Osteolytic stage:** Furious osteoclastic activity. 2. **Mixed osteoclastic-osteoblastic stage:** Both bone resorption and formation. 3. **Osteosclerotic stage:** Osteoblast activity predominates, resulting in abnormal, thick, sclerotic bone that lacks structural integrity. Increased NF-κB activity from SQSTM1 mutations enhances osteoclast activity. Chronic viral infection (e.g., measles) of osteoclast precursors may also play a role. | Mutations in the **SQSTM1** gene (in 50% of familial, 10% of sporadic cases) which increase NF-κB activity. Activating **RANK** mutations or inactivating **OPG** mutations in juvenile forms. | Bone is enlarged, with thickened, coarsened cortices and medulla. The bone is soft and porous and may be deformed (e.g., bowing of femurs/tibiae). | Hallmark is a **mosaic pattern of lamellar bone** in the sclerotic phase. This is produced by unusually prominent cement lines joining haphazardly oriented units of bone. Osteoclasts are abnormally large with many nuclei (up to 100). | Often asymptomatic. Pain in affected bone. Bone overgrowth can compress nerves. Enlarged craniofacial skeleton (**leontiasis ossea**). Bowing of femurs/tibiae. Warmth over skin due to hypervascularity. | Radiographically: Enlarged bone with thick, coarsened cortices and medulla. A wedge-shaped lytic leading edge may be seen in active disease. Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase. Normal serum calcium and phosphate. | **Monostotic:** affects one bone (15%). **Polyostotic:** affects multiple bones (85%), commonly axial skeleton or proximal femur. | Chalk stick-type fractures, severe secondary osteoarthritis, nerve compression, high-output heart failure. **Sarcoma** (osteosarcoma or fibrosarcoma) is the most dreaded complication (in <1% of all patients). | Calcitonin and bisphosphonates. |
| **Osteonecrosis (Avascular Necrosis)** Infarction of bone and marrow. | Fractures or corticosteroid administration are the two most common causes. Other causes include alcohol abuse, bisphosphonate therapy, sickle cell crisis, radiation, tumors. | Connective tissue disease, chronic pancreatitis, Gaucher disease, pregnancy, decompression sickness (dysbarism). | Vascular compromise leads to ischemia and death of bone and marrow cells. In subchondral infarcts, the necrotic bone collapses under mechanical stress, leading to cartilage damage. The slow pace of repair (creeping substitution) cannot keep up with the stress. | - | In subchondral infarcts, a triangular or wedge-shaped pale segment of bone is seen. A space may form between the cartilage and the collapsed bone. | Dead bone is characterized by **empty lacunae** surrounded by necrotic adipocytes. Fatty acids released bind calcium to form insoluble calcium soaps. New bone is deposited on the scaffold of remaining necrotic trabeculae. | Subchondral infarcts cause pain, initially with activity, then becomes constant. Medullary infarcts are usually clinically silent. | - | **Medullary infarcts:** Involve trabecular bone and marrow. Cortex is spared due to collateral blood flow. **Subchondral infarcts:** Affect the area just beneath the articular cartilage. | Collapse of necrotic bone, fracture, sloughing of articular cartilage, secondary osteoarthritis. | - |
| **Osteomyelitis** Inflammation of bone and marrow, almost always secondary to infection. | **Pyogenic:** Bacterial infection, 80-90% is **Staphylococcus aureus**. Others: E. coli, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella (IV drug users), Haemophilus influenzae (neonates), Salmonella (sickle cell disease). **Mycobacterial:** M. tuberculosis.  **Syphilitic:** Treponema pallidum. | Immunosuppression, open fractures, surgical procedures, diabetes (foot infections), sickle cell disease (Salmonella), IV drug use. | Organisms reach bone via hematogenous spread, contiguous site, or direct implantation. Bacteria proliferate, recruit neutrophils, and cause necrosis of bone and marrow within 48 hours. Infection spreads through Haversian systems to the periosteum, forming subperiosteal abscesses and impairing blood supply. Dead bone (**sequestrum**) is surrounded by a shell of living new bone (**involucrum**). | - | Drainage tract in subperiosteal shell of new bone (involucrum) may reveal inner necrotic cortex (sequestrum). | Acute phase: Neutrophilic infiltrate and bone necrosis. Chronic phase: Chronic inflammatory cells, bone resorption, fibrosis, reactive new bone deposition. Tuberculous osteomyelitis shows caseating granulomas. Syphilitic osteomyelitis shows edematous granulation tissue with plasma cells and obliterative endarteritis. | Acute: Systemic illness with malaise, fever, chills, leukocytosis, and intense throbbing pain. May be subtle with just unexplained fever or localized pain. Tuberculous: Localized pain, low-grade fever, chills, weight loss. | Blood cultures may be positive. Radiography shows a lytic focus surrounded by sclerosis. Biopsy and bone culture are required. | **Pyogenic Osteomyelitis** **Mycobacterial Osteomyelitis** **Skeletal Syphilis** | Pathologic fracture, secondary amyloidosis, endocarditis, sepsis, squamous cell carcinoma in sinus tract. Tuberculous osteomyelitis of the spine (**Pott disease**) can cause vertebral collapse, scoliosis/kyphosis, and neurologic deficits. | Combination of antibiotics and surgical drainage. |
| **Osteoid Osteoma and Osteoblastoma** Benign bone-forming tumors with similar histology but different size, site, and symptoms. Osteoid osteoma <2cm, Osteoblastoma >2cm. | Benign neoplasm of osteoblasts. | More common in young men (teens and 20s). | Proliferating osteoblasts produce prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), especially in osteoid osteoma, which causes pain. | - | Round-to-oval, well-circumscribed masses of hemorrhagic, gritty tan tissue. | Randomly interconnected trabeculae of woven bone rimmed by a single layer of prominent osteoblasts. The intertrabecular stroma is loose connective tissue with many dilated capillaries. In osteoid osteoma, reactive bone encircles the lesion (**nidus**). | **Osteoid Osteoma:** Severe nocturnal pain, relieved by aspirin/NSAIDs. Typically in appendicular skeleton (femur/tibia cortex). **Osteoblastoma:** Pain unresponsive to aspirin. Typically in posterior spine. | Radiograph of osteoid osteoma shows a small radiolucent core (nidus) surrounded by abundant reactive bone. | **Osteoid Osteoma:** < 2 cm. **Osteoblastoma:** > 2 cm. | Malignant transformation is rare. | **Osteoid Osteoma:** Radiofrequency ablation. **Osteoblastoma:** Curettage or en bloc excision. |
| **Osteosarcoma** The most common primary malignant tumor of bone, characterized by the production of osteoid matrix by malignant tumor cells. | Malignant neoplasm of osteoblasts. | Bimodal age distribution: 75% before age 20 (adolescent growth spurt); smaller peak in older adults. Predisposing conditions: Paget disease, bone infarcts, prior radiation, genetic syndromes. | Increased proliferation in rapidly growing bones during adolescent growth spurt may predispose to oncogenic mutations. Usually associated with mutations in known tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. | **RB:** Germline mutations confer a 1000-fold increased risk. Mutations present in up to 70% of sporadic cases. **TP53:** Germline mutations in Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Common in sporadic cases. **CDKN2A (INK4a):** Inactivated in many cases. **MDM2 and CDK4:** Overexpressed in many low-grade osteosarcomas (often via amplification of 12q13-q15). | Bulky, gritty, gray-white tumors with hemorrhage and cystic degeneration. Tumor destroys cortex, produces soft tissue masses, and lifts the periosteum. | Diagnosis requires malignant tumor cells producing unmineralized osteoid or mineralized bone. This is often fine and lacelike but can form broad sheets. Cells are pleomorphic, with large hyperchromatic nuclei, bizarre tumor giant cells, and abnormal mitoses. Cartilage can also be produced (chondroblastic osteosarcoma). | Pain, sometimes associated with a pathologic fracture. Enlarging mass. | Radiography shows a destructive, mixed lytic and blastic mass with infiltrative margins. The triangular shadow between the cortex and raised periosteum is known as a **Codman triangle**. | Subclassified by histology (e.g., chondroblastic, fibroblastic, etc.) and location (e.g., intramedullary, surface). Secondary osteosarcomas arise in the setting of other conditions. | Hematogenous metastasis, most commonly to lungs, bones, and brain. | Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery, and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. |
| **Osteochondroma (Exostosis)** The most common benign bone tumor, consisting of a cartilage-capped bony stalk attached to the skeleton. | Benign neoplasm. Considered a developmental anomaly of the growth plate. | Diagnosed in late adolescence/early adulthood. More common in men. Can be part of multiple hereditary exostosis syndrome. | Hereditary exostoses are due to loss-of-function mutations in EXT genes, which synthesize heparan sulfate. Reduced heparan sulfate may prevent normal diffusion of Indian hedgehog (Ihh), disrupting chondrocyte differentiation. This is thought to cause a portion of the growth plate to herniate and grow laterally. | Germline loss-of-function mutations in **EXT1** or **EXT2** genes in hereditary cases. Reduced expression also seen in sporadic cases. | Sessile or pedunculated masses, 1 to 20 cm in size. Composed of a bony stalk capped by cartilage. The medullary cavity is continuous with that of the host bone. | The cap is composed of benign hyaline cartilage that resembles a disorganized growth plate. It undergoes endochondral ossification, forming the inner portion of the tumor. | Slow-growing mass near the growth plate of long bones (especially knee). Can be painful if it impinges on a nerve or if the stalk fractures. Often detected incidentally. | - | **Solitary** (85%, sporadic). **Multiple Hereditary Exostosis Syndrome** (autosomal dominant). | Bowing and shortening of underlying bones (in hereditary syndrome). Rare transformation to secondary chondrosarcoma. | Simple excision if symptomatic. Tumors stop expanding at growth plate closure. |
| **Chondroma** A benign tumor of hyaline cartilage that occurs in bones of endochondral origin. | Benign neoplasm of chondrocytes. | Diagnosed between ages 20 and 50. Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome are risk factors for malignant transformation. | IDH mutations lead to production of the 'oncometabolite' 2-hydroxyglutarate, which interferes with DNA methylation. It is hypothesized that this diffuses into neighboring normal cells, causing oncogenic epigenetic changes (**transformation by association**). | Heterozygous mutations in **IDH1** and **IDH2** genes. Individuals with syndromic forms are genetically mosaic for these mutations. | Well-circumscribed nodules, usually < 3cm, gray-blue, and translucent. | Nodules of hyaline cartilage containing cytologically benign chondrocytes. Peripheral endochondral ossification may occur. Tumors in syndromic forms can be more cellular and have atypia, making distinction from chondrosarcoma difficult. | Typically solitary metaphyseal lesions in tubular bones of hands and feet. Often asymptomatic and found incidentally. Can be painful or cause pathologic fracture. | Radiographically, they are a circumscribed lucency with central irregular calcifications, a sclerotic rim, and an intact cortex. | **Enchondroma:** Arise in the medullary cavity. **Juxtacortical chondroma:** Arise on the bone surface. **Ollier disease:** Multiple enchondromas. **Maffucci syndrome:** Multiple enchondromas and spindle cell hemangiomas. | Sarcomatous transformation is rare in solitary tumors but more frequent in syndromic forms. Maffucci syndrome also has risk of other malignancies (e.g., brain gliomas). | Observation or curettage. |
| **Chondrosarcoma** A malignant cartilage-producing tumor. | Malignant neoplasm of chondrocytes. | Usually in patients 40s or older. Men affected twice as often as women. Can arise secondarily from enchondromas or osteochondromas. | - | Genetically heterogeneous. Can have mutations in **EXT** genes (if arising from osteochondroma syndrome) or **IDH1/IDH2** genes. Silencing of the **CDKN2A** tumor suppressor locus by DNA methylation is relatively common. | Large, bulky tumors made of glistening gray-white, translucent cartilage nodules. Matrix can be gelatinous or myxoid. Spotty calcifications are common. | Neoplastic cartilage infiltrates the marrow space and surrounds preexisting bony trabeculae. Tumors are graded from 1 to 3 based on cellularity, cytologic atypia, and mitotic activity. | Painful, progressively enlarging mass. Commonly arise in axial skeleton (pelvis, shoulder, ribs). | On imaging, calcified matrix appears as foci of flocculent densities. Aggressive tumors destroy cortex and form soft tissue masses. | **Conventional:** Most common. **Clear cell:** In epiphyses of young people. **Dedifferentiated:** Low-grade chondrosarcoma with a second, high-grade non-cartilaginous component. **Mesenchymal:** Small round cells with islands of cartilage. | Hematogenous spread, especially to the lungs. Risk of metastasis correlates with histologic grade (Grade 1 rarely metastasizes; 70% of Grade 3 tumors do). | Wide surgical excision. Mesenchymal and dedifferentiated tumors may require adjuvant chemotherapy. |
| **Ewing Sarcoma** A malignant bone tumor characterized by primitive round cells without obvious differentiation. | Malignant small round cell tumor, likely of mesenchymal stem cell or primitive neuroectodermal origin. | ~80% of patients are younger than 20. Boys more affected than girls. Striking predilection for Caucasians. | A balanced translocation creates a fusion gene (most commonly EWSR1/FLI1) which encodes a chimeric protein that binds to chromatin and dysregulates transcription, leading to uncontrolled growth. | >90% have a balanced translocation involving the **EWSR1** gene on chromosome 22. Most common partner is the **FLI1** gene on chromosome 11, creating an **EWSR1/FLI1** fusion gene. | Soft, tan-white tumor arising in the medullary cavity that invades cortex, periosteum, and soft tissue. Often has hemorrhage and necrosis. | Sheets of uniform small, round cells with scant, clear cytoplasm (due to glycogen, which stains with PAS). **Homer-Wright rosettes** (rounded cell clusters with a central fibrillary core) indicate neuroectodermal differentiation. | Painful, enlarging mass, usually in the diaphysis of long bones (femur) or flat bones (pelvis). Affected site is tender, warm, and swollen. Systemic findings (fever, anemia, leukocytosis) can mimic infection. | Radiographs show a destructive lytic tumor with permeative (moth-eaten) margins. Characteristic periosteal reaction produces layers of bone in an **onion-skin** fashion. | - | Aggressive neoplasm with metastasis. | Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgical excision, and adjuvant chemotherapy, with or without irradiation. |
| **Giant Cell Tumor (Osteoclastoma)** A benign but locally aggressive tumor characterized by the presence of numerous multinucleated osteoclast-type giant cells. | Neoplasm of primitive osteoblast precursors. | Uncommon tumor, usually arises in the third through fifth decades. | The neoplastic cells are primitive osteoblast precursors that express high levels of RANKL. RANKL promotes the proliferation and differentiation of non-neoplastic osteoclast precursors into mature osteoclasts. This leads to localized but highly destructive bone resorption. | Neoplastic cells have acquired mutations in the gene encoding histone 3.3. | Large, red-brown masses that frequently undergo cystic degeneration. Often destroys cortex, resulting in a bulging soft tissue mass delineated by a thin shell of reactive bone. | Consists of uniform oval mononuclear tumor cells and abundant osteoclast-type giant cells with 100 or more nuclei. Tumor cells do not synthesize bone or cartilage. Necrosis and mitotic activity can be prominent. | Develops in the epiphysis, often near the knee (distal femur/proximal tibia). Can cause arthritis-like symptoms or present with pathologic fracture. | Radiography shows a predominantly lytic and expansile lesion with destruction of the cortex. | - | Locally aggressive with a high recurrence rate (40-60%). Up to 4% metastasize to the lungs, but these can regress spontaneously and are seldom fatal. | Curettage. The RANKL inhibitor denosumab has shown promise as an adjuvant therapy. |
| **Aneurysmal Bone Cyst (ABC)** A benign but locally aggressive lesion characterized by multiloculated blood-filled spaces. | Benign clonal neoplasm of spindle cells. | Most cases present in adolescence. | Chromosomal rearrangement fuses the USP6 coding region to promoters of highly expressed genes. Overexpression of USP6 (a deubiquitinating enzyme) regulates NF-κB activity, which upregulates matrix metalloproteases, leading to cystic bone resorption. | Nearly 70% of cases have chromosome 17p13 rearrangements involving the **USP6** gene (fused with promoters like **CDH11**). | Multiple blood-filled cystic spaces separated by thin, tan-white septa. | Septa are composed of plump spindle cells, multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells, and reactive woven bone. About one-third of cases contain a densely calcified matrix called "**blue bone**." | Presents with localized pain and swelling. Most frequently in the femur, tibia, and vertebral body. | Radiographically an expansile, well-circumscribed lytic lesion with a thin sclerotic "eggshell" of reactive bone. Internal septae may create a "**soap bubble**" appearance. CT/MRI show characteristic fluid-fluid levels. | - | Locally aggressive, can cause nerve compression. Recurrence in 10-50% of cases. | Curettage or excision. |
| **Fibrous Cortical Defect and Nonossifying Fibroma** Common developmental abnormalities where fibrous tissue replaces bone. Lesions > 5-6 cm are termed nonossifying fibromas. | Developmental defect, not a true neoplasm. | Present in up to 50% of children older than 2 years. | - | - | Grossly yellow-brown. | Bland fibroblasts, often in a **storiform (pinwheel) pattern**. Macrophages may be present as foamy cells or multinucleated giant cells. Hemosiderin is common. | Asymptomatic and detected incidentally. Arise eccentrically in the metaphysis of distal femur/proximal tibia. | Sharply demarcated radiolucent masses surrounded by a thin rim of sclerosis. Biopsy is rarely necessary. | **Fibrous Cortical Defect:** < 0.5 cm. **Nonossifying Fibroma:** 5-6 cm. | Most have limited growth and resolve spontaneously. Larger lesions may present with pathologic fracture. | Usually none needed. Curettage for large/symptomatic lesions. |
| **Fibrous Dysplasia** A benign tumor likened to a localized developmental arrest, where all components of bone are present but do not mature. | Benign clonal neoplasm resulting from a somatic mutation. | Occurs in early adolescence (monostotic) or slightly earlier (polyostotic). | Somatic gain-of-function mutations in GNAS1 lead to a constitutively active Gs protein. This promotes cellular proliferation and disturbs osteoblast differentiation. The clinical phenotype depends on when the mutation occurs during embryogenesis. | Somatic gain-of-function mutations in the **GNAS1** gene. Affected individuals are genetic mosaics. | Tan-white, gritty tissue that expands the medullary cavity and can cause bowing/cortical thinning. | Curvilinear trabeculae of woven bone (resembling Chinese characters) in a background of moderately cellular fibroblastic proliferation. Crucially, the trabeculae **lack prominent osteoblastic rimming**. Hyaline cartilage nodules may be present. | Monostotic is often asymptomatic. Polyostotic can cause pain, limb length discrepancy, and pathologic fractures. McCune-Albright syndrome presents with precocious puberty (especially in girls), café-au-lait spots, and other endocrinopathies. | - | **Monostotic:** Single bone. **Polyostotic:** Multiple bones. **Mazabraud syndrome:** Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia and soft tissue myxomas. **McCune-Albright syndrome:** Polyostotic disease with café-au-lait spots and endocrinopathies. | Crippling deformities and fractures (in polyostotic). Rare malignant transformation to sarcoma. | Symptomatic lesions are treated by curettage. Bisphosphonates can reduce pain. Endocrinopathies are treated medically. |
| **Metastatic Tumors to Bone** The most common form of skeletal malignancy. | Spread of cancer from another primary site. Adults: prostate, breast, kidney, lung. Children: neuroblastoma, Wilms tumor, osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma. | - | **Lytic lesions:** Tumor cells secrete substances (prostaglandins, cytokines, PTHrP) that up-regulate RANKL on osteoblasts, stimulating osteoclast activity. **Blastic (sclerotic) lesions:** Tumor cells secrete proteins (e.g., WNT proteins) that stimulate osteoblastic bone formation. | - | - | - | - | Radiographic appearance can be lytic (bone destroying), blastic (bone forming), or mixed. Prostatic cancer is typically blastic; kidney and lung are typically lytic. | Typically multifocal, involving the axial skeleton (vertebral column, pelvis, ribs, skull). | Indicates wide dissemination of cancer and a poor prognosis. Pathologic fractures. | Symptomatic relief and prevention of spread. Options include systemic chemo/immunotherapy, localized radiation, bisphosphonates, and surgery. |
| **Osteoarthritis (OA) / Degenerative Joint Disease** The most common joint disorder, characterized by degeneration of articular cartilage resulting in structural and functional failure of synovial joints. | Primarily a degenerative disease of cartilage, with inflammation being secondary. Initiated by biomechanical stress and cartilage injury. | Aging (>50 years), female gender (knees/hands), male gender (hips), obesity, joint deformity, previous joint injury, underlying systemic disease (diabetes, hemochromatosis). | 1. **Chondrocyte Injury:** Biomechanical stresses cause injury. 2. **Early OA:** Chondrocytes proliferate and secrete inflammatory mediators (TGF-β, TNF, prostaglandins) and MMPs that degrade collagen and proteoglycans. Degradation exceeds synthesis. 3. **Late OA:** Marked chondrocyte loss and severe matrix degradation. | Genetic factors, including polymorphisms in genes encoding matrix and signaling molecules, may predispose to chondrocyte injury. | Exposed subchondral bone becomes polished ivory-like (**bone eburnation**). Mushroom-shaped bony outgrowths (**osteophytes**) develop at the margins. | Cartilage surface is granular and soft (**fibrillation**) with fissures and clefts. Full-thickness portions of cartilage are sloughed off, forming **loose bodies**. Subchondral bone undergoes sclerosis and develops fibrous-walled cysts. Synovium is mildly congested and fibrotic. | Deep, achy pain that worsens with use. Morning stiffness, crepitus, limitation of movement. Affects weight-bearing joints (hips, knees), lower spine, and hands. Prominent osteophytes at distal interphalangeal joints are called **Heberden nodes**. | No serum antibodies. Radiographs show narrowed joint space, subchondral sclerosis, osteophytes, and subchondral cysts. | **Primary (idiopathic):** Appears without initiating cause, usually oligoarticular. **Secondary:** Appears in younger individuals with predisposing conditions. | Joint deformities, nerve root compression from spinal osteophytes. Joint fusion (ankylosis) does not occur. | Pain management, NSAIDs, intraarticular corticosteroids, activity modification. Severe cases require arthroplasty. No treatment halts progression. |
| **Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)** A chronic systemic autoimmune disorder that principally attacks the joints, producing a nonsuppurative proliferative and inflammatory synovitis. | Autoimmune disease, likely triggered by environmental factors in genetically predisposed individuals. | Female gender (3x more common), peak incidence in 2nd-4th decades, genetic susceptibility (HLA-DR4), smoking, infection (periodontitis). | Initiated by CD4+ helper T cells responding to self-antigens (e.g., citrullinated proteins). Cytokines play a key role: - **IFN-γ** (Th1) activates macrophages. - **IL-17** (Th17) recruits neutrophils/monocytes. - **TNF** and **IL-1** from macrophages stimulate synovial cells to secrete proteases that destroy cartilage. - T cells express **RANKL**, stimulating osteoclasts and bone resorption. A **pannus** (mass of inflamed synovium, inflammatory cells, granulation tissue, and fibroblasts) grows over and erodes the cartilage. | Associated with the **HLA-DR4** allele, especially in patients positive for ACPA. Polymorphisms in **PTPN22** are also associated. | Synovium is edematous, thickened, and hyperplastic, with delicate villi. Rheumatoid nodules are firm, subcutaneous masses. | Synovium shows: 1) synovial cell hyperplasia, 2) dense inflammatory infiltrates (often with lymphoid follicles) of T-cells, B-cells, plasma cells, macrophages, 3) increased vascularity, 4) fibrinopurulent exudate, 5) osteoclastic activity causing erosions. A **pannus** is formed. Rheumatoid nodules show a central zone of fibrinoid necrosis surrounded by a rim of activated macrophages. | Symmetrical polyarthritis affecting small joints of hands and feet before larger ones. Wrists, ankles, elbows, knees also common. Swollen, warm, painful joints. Prolonged morning stiffness. Characteristic deformities: radial deviation of wrist, ulnar deviation of fingers, swan-neck and boutonnière deformities. | **Anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPAs):** Diagnostic marker, found in ~70%. **Rheumatoid factor (RF):** IgM/IgA autoantibodies against IgG Fc region, in ~80%. Radiographs show joint effusions, juxta-articular osteopenia, erosions, and joint space narrowing. | - | Articular cartilage destruction, joint fusion (**fibrous or bony ankylosis**). Extra-articular manifestations: rheumatoid nodules, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, pleuritis, pericarditis, uveitis, keratoconjunctivitis. | Corticosteroids, methotrexate, and especially **TNF antagonists** (biologics), which are very effective. |
| **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)** A heterogeneous group of disorders of unknown cause presenting with arthritis before age 16 that persists for at least 6 weeks. | Unknown cause. | - | Undefined, but shares features with adult RA, with involvement of Th1 and Th17 cells and inflammatory mediators like IL-1, IL-17, TNF, and IFN-γ. | Associations with certain HLA and **PTPN22** gene variants. | - | - | More commonly associated with oligoarthritis, systemic disease, and involvement of large joints compared to RA. | Antinuclear antibody (ANA) seropositivity is typical. Rheumatoid nodules and RF are usually absent. | Subclassified based on clinical and laboratory features (e.g., oligoarticular, systemic, polyarticular RF-positive/negative). | About 10% develop serious functional disability. | Similar to adult RA. Systemic IL-6 receptor antibody has shown some success. |
| **Seronegative Spondyloarthropathies** A heterogeneous group of disorders unified by absence of RF, pathologic changes in ligamentous attachments (enthesitis), sacroiliac joint involvement, association with HLA-B27, and bony proliferation leading to ankylosis. | Immune-mediated, triggered by T-cell responses against undefined microbial antigens that cross-react with musculoskeletal components. | HLA-B27 positivity. | T-cell responses, likely against microbial antigens that cross-react with self-antigens in musculoskeletal system components, lead to inflammation, primarily at entheses. | Strong association with **HLA-B27**. | - | Inflammation at ligamentous attachments (enthesitis) rather than synovium. Bony proliferation leads to ankylosis. | - | Absence of rheumatoid factor. Positive for HLA-B27. | Includes Ankylosing Spondylitis, Reactive Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis, and Enteropathic Arthritis. | - | - |
| **Ankylosing Spondylitis** A spondyloarthropathy causing destruction of articular cartilage and bony ankylosis, especially of the sacroiliac and vertebral apophyseal joints. | Autoimmune, triggered by unknown antigen. | ~90% of patients are HLA-B27 positive. Presents in 2nd-3rd decades of life. | - | Strong association with **HLA-B27**. | - | - | Lower back pain and spinal immobility. Peripheral joints (hips, knees, shoulders) involved in about one-third of cases. | - | - | - | - |
| **Reactive Arthritis** Defined by the triad of arthritis, nongonococcal urethritis/cervicitis, and conjunctivitis following an infection. Now broadened to include arthritis after GI or GU infections. | Immune reaction following a genitourinary (Chlamydia) or gastrointestinal (Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia, Campylobacter) infection. | HLA-B27 is common. HIV-positive patients. | - | Associated with **HLA-B27**. | - | Synovitis of a digital tendon sheath produces "sausage" finger or toe. | Presents as an acute-onset asymmetric oligoarthritis, often in lower extremities. Enthesitis (Achilles tendon) is common. **"Sausage-like digits" (dactylitis)**. Extra-articular features include conjunctivitis, uveitis, urethritis, balanitis, skin rashes. | - | - | Recurrent arthritis, tendonitis, lumbosacral pain. Chronic reactive arthritis may progress to spondyloarthritis. Cardiac valvular disease (aortic insufficiency). | - |
| **Gout** Marked by transient attacks of acute arthritis initiated by monosodium urate (MSU) crystals deposited in and around joints due to hyperuricemia. | Underlying cause is hyperuricemia (>6.8 mg/dL), which can result from overproduction or (more commonly) reduced excretion of uric acid. | Male sex, age, duration of hyperuricemia, genetic predisposition, alcohol consumption, obesity, drugs (thiazides). | Precipitation of MSU crystals in joints triggers inflammation. Macrophages and neutrophils phagocytose the crystals, which activates the **inflammasome** and leads to secretion of **IL-1**. This recruits more inflammatory cells, creating a vicious cycle. Repeated attacks lead to formation of **tophi** (aggregates of crystals and inflammatory cells). | **Primary Gout:** Unknown enzyme defects or polymorphisms in genes like **URAT1**, **GLUT9** which regulate urate transport. X-linked partial deficiency of **HGPRT** (hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase) can cause overproduction. **Secondary Gout:** Complete absence of HGPRT (Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). | Tophi are large aggregations of urate crystals that may appear in articular cartilage, ligaments, tendons, and soft tissues (earlobes). Can ulcerate skin. | **Acute arthritis:** Dense neutrophilic infiltrate. Slender, needle-shaped, negatively birefringent urate crystals in synovial fluid, often within neutrophils. **Chronic arthritis:** Pannus formation destroys cartilage. **Tophi:** Aggregates of urate crystals surrounded by an intense inflammatory reaction with foreign-body giant cells. | Sudden-onset, excruciating joint pain with hyperemia and warmth. Most first attacks are monoarticular, with 50% occurring in the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the big toe. Followed by symptom-free intercritical periods. | Hyperuricemia. Identification of needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals in synovial fluid is diagnostic. | **Primary (90%):** Cause unknown or from specific enzyme defect. **Secondary (10%):** Due to another disease (leukemia, renal failure) or congenital disorders. | Chronic tophaceous arthritis leading to bone erosion and joint destruction. Urate nephropathy, including uric acid nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis. | Lifestyle/dietary modification. Drugs include NSAIDs, colchicine, allopurinol (xanthine oxidase inhibitor), probenecid. |
| **Pseudogout (Calcium Pyrophosphate Crystal Deposition Disease - CPPD)** Arthritis caused by deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals. | Deposition of CPPD crystals in articular cartilage and synovium. | Age > 50. Previous joint damage, hyperparathyroidism, hemochromatosis, hypothyroidism, diabetes. | Basis for crystal formation is not known; may relate to degradation of cartilage proteoglycans. As in gout, inflammation is caused by activation of the **inflammasome** in macrophages after crystal phagocytosis. | A hereditary autosomal dominant variant is caused by germline gain-of-function mutations in **ANKH**, an inorganic pyrophosphate transporter gene. | Chalky, white, friable crystal deposits in articular cartilage, menisci, and intervertebral discs. | Crystals are rhomboid-shaped, 0.5 to 5 µm, and are weakly positively birefringent. Seen in H&E stains as oval blue-purple aggregates. Inflammation is usually milder than in gout. | Often asymptomatic. Can produce acute, subacute, or chronic arthritis that mimics OA or RA. Knees are most commonly affected, followed by wrists, elbows, shoulders, ankles. | Identification of rhomboid, weakly positively birefringent crystals in synovial fluid. Radiographically evident calcification of cartilage (**chondrocalcinosis**) is often present. | **Sporadic (idiopathic)** **Hereditary** **Secondary** (associated with other disorders) | Significant joint damage in ~50% of affected individuals. | Supportive therapy to minimize symptoms. No treatment prevents or slows crystal formation. |
| **Lipoma** A benign tumor of fat; the most common soft tissue tumor in adults. | Benign neoplasm of adipocytes. | Middle adulthood. | - | - | Well-encapsulated mass of mature fat. Usually arises in the subcutis of proximal extremities and trunk. | Composed of mature adipocytes indistinguishable from normal fat. | Soft, mobile, and painless mass. | - | **Conventional lipoma:** Most common. **Lipomatosis:** Multifocal lipomas involving a limb. | - | Simple excision. |
| **Liposarcoma** Malignant tumor of adipose tissue; the most common sarcoma of adulthood. | Malignant neoplasm of adipocytes. | Occurs in the 6th and 7th decades. | Varies by subtype. Well-differentiated type has gene amplifications. Myxoid type has a fusion gene that arrests adipocyte differentiation. | **Well-differentiated:** Amplification of chromosome 12q13-q15, which includes the **MDM2** gene. **Myxoid:** Characteristic t(12;16) translocation creating a **FUS-DDIT3** fusion gene. **Pleomorphic:** Complex karyotypes. | - | **Well-differentiated:** Mature adipocytes with scattered atypical spindle cells. **Myxoid:** Abundant basophilic extracellular matrix, arborizing capillaries ("chicken wire" vessels), and primitive cells resembling fetal fat. **Pleomorphic:** Sheets of anaplastic cells, bizarre nuclei, and immature adipocytes (**lipoblasts**). | Typically develops in deep soft tissues of the proximal extremities and retroperitoneum. | - | **Well-differentiated:** Indolent. **Myxoid:** Intermediate behavior. **Pleomorphic:** Aggressive and frequently metastasize. | Recur locally. Metastasis depends on subtype. | Adequate excision. |
| **Rhabdomyosarcoma** A malignant mesenchymal tumor with skeletal muscle differentiation. The most common soft tissue sarcoma of childhood. | Malignant neoplasm with skeletal muscle differentiation. | Most appear before age 20. | In the alveolar type, the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein, a chimeric transcription factor, interferes with skeletal muscle differentiation. | **Alveolar:** Frequently contains fusions of the **FOXO1** gene to either **PAX3** (t(2;13)) or **PAX7** (t(1;13)). **Embryonal and Pleomorphic:** Genetically heterogeneous. | **Embryonal:** Soft, gray, infiltrative mass. | **Embryonal:** Sheets of primitive round and spindled cells in a myxoid stroma. Can have **rhabdomyoblasts** with visible cross-striations. **Alveolar:** Fibrous septae divide cells into clusters, resembling pulmonary alveoli. **Pleomorphic:** Large, bizarre, eosinophilic tumor cells. Immunohistochemistry for muscle markers (myogenin, desmin) is used for diagnosis. | Pediatric cases often arise in sinuses, head and neck, and genitourinary tract. | - | **Alveolar** (20%) **Embryonal** (50%) **Pleomorphic** (20%) **Spindle cell/sclerosing** (10%) **Sarcoma botryoides:** Variant of embryonal type in hollow, mucosal-lined structures (bladder, vagina). | Aggressive tumors. Survival correlated with histologic type and location (sarcoma botryoides has best prognosis). | Surgical resection and chemotherapy, with or without radiation. |
| **Leiomyosarcoma** A malignant tumor of smooth muscle. | Malignant neoplasm with smooth muscle differentiation. | Occurs in adults, more frequent in women. | - | Complex genotypes due to underlying defects in genomic stability. | Painless firm masses. Retroperitoneal tumors can be large and bulky. | Eosinophilic spindle cells with blunt-ended ("cigar-shaped"), hyperchromatic nuclei arranged in interweaving fascicles. Immunohistochemical detection of smooth muscle actin, desmin, and caldesmon aids diagnosis. | Most often develops in deep soft tissues of the extremities and the retroperitoneum. | - | - | Retroperitoneal tumors are often fatal due to local extension and metastatic spread, especially to the lungs. | Treatment depends on tumor size, location, and grade. |
| **Soft Tissue Sarcoma (General)** Malignant mesenchymal neoplasms distinct from tumors of epithelial, skeletal, CNS, or hematopoietic tissues. | Most are sporadic. A minority are associated with germline mutations or environmental exposures (radiation, toxins). | Associated genetic syndromes (NF1, Gardner, Li-Fraumeni). Incidence increases with age. | Believed to arise from pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells which acquire somatic "driver" mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. | Highly variable. See specific sarcoma types. | Varies by type; often large, fleshy masses. | Varies from monomorphic tumors with specific histology to highly pleomorphic tumors with no clear line of differentiation. | Most arise in the extremities, particularly the thigh. | Diagnosis relies on integrating morphology, immunohistochemistry, and molecular diagnostics. Grade and stage are key prognostic indicators. | **Simple karyotype (~20%):** Specific translocations (e.g., Ewing, synovial sarcoma). More common in younger individuals. **Complex karyotype (~80%):** Aneuploid, multiple chromosomal changes (e.g., leiomyosarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma). More common in adults. | Aggressive behavior and resistance to chemotherapy contribute to significant cancer mortality. | - |
