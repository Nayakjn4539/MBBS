# Neovascular Glaucoma (NVG)

### Definition
[[Neovascular Glaucoma]] (NVG) is a severe, intractable form of **secondary glaucoma** characterized by the development of new vessels (neovascularization) over the [[iris]] (rubeosis iridis) and the [[angle of anterior chamber]], leading to obstruction of aqueous outflow and a subsequent rise in [[intraocular pressure]] (IOP).

### Etiology and Risk Factors
NVG typically follows extensive retinal ischemia. The ischemic retina releases angiogenic factors that stimulate vessel growth in the anterior segment.

**Common Causes:**
*   **Ischemic Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO):** This is a major cause. NVG typically develops about 3 months (90 days) after the occlusion, leading to the term **"100-day glaucoma"** or **"90-day glaucoma"**.
*   **Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR):** A very common cause.
*   **Eales' Disease**.
*   **Sickle Cell Retinopathy**.
*   **Ocular Ischemic Syndrome** (Carotid occlusive disease).
*   **Intraocular Tumors:** E.g., [[Retinoblastoma]], [[Malignant Melanoma]].
*   **Chronic Intraocular Inflammation (Uveitis)**.
*   **Long-standing Retinal Detachment**.

### Pathogenesis
The fundamental mechanism involves **retinal hypoxia** triggering a cascade of events:
1.  **Ischemia:** Severe retinal ischemia leads to the production of vasoproliferative substances, primarily **Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ([[VEGF]])**.
2.  **Diffusion:** These factors diffuse into the [[anterior chamber]].
3.  **Rubeosis Iridis:** New vessels grow on the iris surface and pupillary margin.
4.  **Angle Involvement:** New vessels proliferate into the angle of the anterior chamber.
5.  **Membrane Formation:** A fibrovascular membrane forms over the [[trabecular meshwork]]. Initially, this obstructs outflow while the angle appears open gonioscopically (Secondary Open Angle Glaucoma).
6.  **Angle Closure:** The fibrovascular membrane contracts, pulling the peripheral iris forward and adhering it to the cornea (Peripheral Anterior Synechiae). This creates a **"zipper-like"** closure of the angle, resulting in severe Secondary Angle Closure Glaucoma.

### Clinical Profile and Staging
NVG generally progresses through three distinct stages:

| Stage | Clinical Features | Pathophysiology |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Pre-glaucomatous Stage** | • **Rubeosis Iridis:** Tiny tufts of new vessels at the pupillary margin and angle.<br>• Normal IOP. | Angiogenic factors stimulate vessel growth, but outflow is not yet significantly compromised. |
| **2. Open-Angle Glaucoma Stage** | • Increased IOP.<br>• [[Rubeosis iridis]] becomes more prominent.<br>• **Angle:** Appears open on [[gonioscopy]]. | A pre-trabecular neovascular membrane covers the trabecular meshwork, obstructing aqueous outflow despite an open angle. |
| **3. Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma** | • **Intractable IOP rise** (often >60 mmHg).<br>• Severe pain, redness (congestion), corneal edema.<br>• **Ectropion Uveae:** Pulling of iris pigment epithelium onto the anterior surface.<br>• **Angle:** Closed (Zipper closure). | Contraction of the fibrovascular membrane causes extensive [[peripheral anterior synechiae]] (PAS), permanently sealing the angle. |

**Clinical Signs:**
*   **Rubeosis Iridis:** Visible new vessels on the iris.
*   **Congestion:** Ciliary and conjunctival congestion.
*   **Corneal Edema:** Due to high IOP.
*   **Hyphema:** Blood in the anterior chamber (new vessels are fragile and leak).
*   **Ectropion Uveae:** Eversion of the pupillary margin.

### Diagnosis
1.  **Slit Lamp Examination:** To detect rubeosis iridis (undilated examination is crucial before mydriasis).
2.  **Gonioscopy:** Essential to identify neovascularization of the angle (NVA) and determine if the angle is open or closed.
3.  **Fundus Fluorescein Angiography ([[FFA]]):** To assess retinal ischemia and capillary non-perfusion.

### Management
Treatment is often challenging and involves managing the underlying ischemia, controlling IOP, and addressing pain.

#### 1. Prophylaxis and Treatment of Underlying Cause
*   **Panretinal Photocoagulation ([[PRP]]):** This is the **gold standard** treatment. Laser burns are applied to the ischemic retina to convert hypoxic areas into anoxic scars, thereby reducing the production of [[VEGF]] and causing regression of new vessels.
*   **Cryotherapy:** Anterior retinal cryopexy can be used if the media (cornea/lens) is too hazy for laser.
*   **Anti-VEGF Agents:** Intravitreal injections of agents like **Bevacizumab (Avastin)**, **Ranibizumab (Lucentis)**, or **Aflibercept** cause rapid regression of new vessels. They are often used as an adjunct to PRP or surgery.

#### 2. Medical Control of IOP
*   **Aqueous Suppressants:** Topical [[Beta-blockers]] (e.g., Timolol) and [[Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors]] (e.g., Dorzolamide). Systemic Acetazolamide may be needed.
*   **Hyperosmotic Agents:** IV Mannitol for acute reduction of very high IOP.
*   **Contraindications:**
    *   **Miotics (Pilocarpine):** Generally avoided as they increase inflammation and may worsen synechiae.
    *   **Prostaglandin Analogues:** Usually avoided due to the risk of increasing inflammation.

#### 3. Surgical Management
Surgery is indicated when medical therapy and PRP fail to control IOP.
*   **Glaucoma Drainage Devices ([[Seton Operation]]):** Implantation of valved (e.g., [[Ahmed Glaucoma Valve]]) or non-valved (e.g., Molteno, Baerveldt) tube shunts is preferred over trabeculectomy for NVG as they have higher success rates.
*   **Trabeculectomy with Antimetabolites:** Standard trabeculectomy has a high failure rate in NVG due to fibrosis. Use of **[[Mitomycin C]] (MMC)** or **5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)** is essential if this surgery is attempted.

#### 4. Management of Painful Blind Eye (Absolute Glaucoma)
If vision is lost and the eye remains painful:
*   **Cyclodestructive Procedures:** Cyclocryotherapy or Diode laser cyclophotocoagulation to destroy the ciliary body and reduce aqueous production.
*   **Retrobulbar Alcohol Injection:** For pain relief.
*   **Enucleation:** Removal of the eye if pain is intractable or if an intraocular tumor is the cause.

### Clinical Implications
*   **"100-Day Glaucoma":** Always monitor patients with ischemic CRVO closely for 3-4 months for the development of rubeosis or angle neovascularization.
*   **Prognosis:** Visual prognosis is generally poor once NVG is established. Early detection of rubeosis (pre-glaucomatous stage) and prompt PRP is the key to saving vision.
