# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Microfilaria rate

### Microfilaria Rate (Mf Rate)

**Definition**
The **Microfilaria Rate** is defined as the percentage of persons showing [[Microfilariae (Mf)]] in their peripheral blood in a sample population. It is a crucial parasitological parameter used to assess the prevalence of filarial infection in a community.

**Formula**
$$ \text{Microfilaria Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of persons positive for Microfilariae}}{\text{Total number of persons examined}} \times 100 $$

**Methodology for Estimation**
To calculate an accurate Mf rate, a **Mass Blood Survey** is conducted with the following strict criteria:
*   **Timing:** Blood must be collected at night, specifically between **8:30 PM and 12:00 Midnight**. This is because *Wuchereria bancrofti* and *Brugia malayi* (common in India) exhibit [[Nocturnal Periodicity]] (they appear in peripheral blood at night).
*   **Sample Volume:** **20 cu. mm** (approximately 4 drops) of capillary blood is collected.
*   **Technique:** A **Thick Blood Smear** is prepared, dehemoglobinized, and stained (usually with JSB or Giemsa stain).
*   **Sample Size:** For routine surveys, 5–7% of the population is examined. For evaluation surveys, at least 20% of the population is examined.

**Interpretation of Endemicity**
The Mf rate helps classify the level of endemicity in a region:

| **Endemicity Level** | **Microfilaria Rate (%)** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Low Endemicity** | 1 – 5% |
| **Moderate Endemicity** | 6 – 20% |
| **High Endemicity** | 21 – 30% |
| **Hyper-Endemicity** | > 30% |

**Public Health Importance**
*   **Indicator of Infection:** It reflects the **prevalence of infection** (the reservoir) in the community, regardless of whether clinical symptoms are present.
*   **Asymptomatic Carriers:** It detects [[Asymptomatic Microfilaraemia]]. These individuals appear healthy but are the primary source of infection for mosquitoes.
*   **Program Evaluation:** It is a key indicator to monitor the success of the **National Filaria Control Programme (NFCP)** and Mass Drug Administration (MDA).

**Elimination Target**
Under the [[Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis]], the target is to reduce the Microfilaria Rate to **less than 1%** (<1%) in the community.

**Mnemonic: "Lo-Mo-Hi-Hyper" (For Endemicity Grading)**
*   **Lo** (Low): **1** to **5** (Think of a low-five)
*   **Mo** (Moderate): **6** to **20** (Think of Cricket "T-20" matches being moderate length)
*   **Hi** (High): **21** to **30**
*   **Hyper** (Hyper-endemic): **>30** (Hyper means over/above 30)

**Clinical Relevance**
A patient may have a high Microfilaria Rate in their blood but show **no clinical signs** (Elephantiasis or Hydrocele). Conversely, patients with advanced [[Elephantiasis]] often have a **negative** Mf rate because the adult worms are dead or fibrosis blocks the release of microfilariae into the blood. Therefore, Mf rate alone underestimates the total burden of disease; it must be interpreted alongside the **Filarial Endemicity Rate** (which includes both Mf positive and clinically diseased persons).
