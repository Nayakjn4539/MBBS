# [[Surgeries In Ophthalmology]] > Pterygium Operation

# Pterygium Operation & Instrumentation

## Overview of Pterygium
[[Pterygium]] is a wing-shaped, degenerative, fibrovascular hyperplasia of the [[conjunctiva]] that encroaches onto the [[cornea]]. It typically occurs in the interpalpebral zone, usually on the nasal side.

### Pathophysiology
*   **Etiology:** Long-term exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, dry heat, and dust.
*   **Pathology:** Elastotic degeneration of the subconjunctival tissue with proliferation of vascularized granulation tissue under the epithelium. It destroys the [[Bowman's membrane]] and superficial [[corneal stroma]].

### Indications for Surgery
Surgical excision is the only satisfactory treatment. Indications include:
1.  **Visual Impairment:** Encroachment onto the pupillary area or visual axis.
2.  **Astigmatism:** Significant irregular [[astigmatism]] caused by the flattening of the cornea in the horizontal meridian,.
3.  **Cosmetic:** Disfigurement (fleshy growth).
4.  **Motility Restriction:** Diplopia due to fibrosis restricting extraocular muscle movement (rare).
5.  **Chronic Irritation:** Persistent inflammation not relieved by medical therapy.

## Surgical Instruments
The following instruments are essential for performing Pterygium excision and [[Conjunctival Limbal Autograft]] (CLAU).

### 1. Eye Speculum
*   **Types:** [[Universal Wire Speculum]] (Barraquer) or Eye speculum with guard.
*   **Function:** To keep the eyelids apart and maintain exposure of the surgical field.
*   **Feature:** Wire speculums are light and cause minimal pressure on the [[eyeball]].

### 2. Fixation Forceps
*   **Types:** [[Globe Fixation Forceps]] (1x2 teeth) or St. Martin's forceps.
*   **Function:**
    *   To stabilize the [[eyeball]] during dissection.
    *   To grasp the neck of the pterygium near the corneal margin to lift it for dissection.

### 3. Scalpel Handle and Blades / Knives
*   **Types:**
    *   **Bard-Parker Handle:** Usually No. 3 handle with Blade No. 15 (for dissection) or No. 11.
    *   **Crescent Knife:** Blunt-tipped, bevel-up knife (often used in cataract surgery but excellent for corneal dissection).
    *   **Razor Blade Fragment:** Held in a fragment holder.
*   **Function:**
    *   To dissect the **Head** of the pterygium off the cornea (Shaving technique),.
    *   To separate the pterygium tissue from the underlying [[sclera]].

### 4. Conjunctival Scissors
*   **Types:** [[Westcott Scissors]] (Spring scissors) or fine curved sharp-tipped scissors.
*   **Function:**
    *   To excise the main mass (body) of the pterygium.
    *   To cut the [[conjunctiva]] and [[Tenon's capsule]].
    *   To harvest the conjunctival autograft from the superior bulbar conjunctiva.

### 5. Plain Dissecting Forceps
*   **Types:** Plain forceps (non-toothed).
*   **Function:**
    *   To handle the delicate conjunctival autograft without tearing or buttonholing it.
    *   To hold the conjunctiva during suturing.
    *   To tie sutures.

### 6. Needle Holder
*   **Types:** [[Barraquer Needle Holder]] (Spring action) or Castroviejo needle holder.
*   **Function:** To hold fine needles (usually 10-0 monofilament nylon or 8-0 Vicryl) for suturing the graft to the episclera and surrounding conjunctiva.

## Surgical Technique: Pterygium Excision with Autograft
The goal is complete removal and prevention of recurrence (which can be 30-50% with simple excision).

### Step-by-Step Procedure
1.  **Anesthesia:** Topical anesthesia (e.g., Proparacaine) or Subconjunctival/Peribulbar anesthesia (Lignocaine).
2.  **Exposure:** Apply the [[Universal Wire Speculum]].
3.  **Head Dissection:**
    *   The head is lifted and dissected off the cornea using a **Crescent knife** or **BP Blade**. Great care is taken to remove it smoothly (keratectomy) to leave a clear corneal surface.
4.  **Body Excision:**
    *   The main mass is separated from the underlying sclera and superficial conjunctiva.
    *   The pterygium tissue is excised using **Conjunctival Scissors** (Westcott). Care is taken not to damage the underlying [[Medial Rectus]] muscle.
5.  **Hemostasis:** Wet field cautery is applied gently to bleeding episcleral vessels.
6.  **Graft Harvesting (CLAU):**
    *   A free [[Conjunctival Limbal Autograft]] is harvested from the supero-temporal bulbar conjunctiva of the same eye.
    *   **Important:** The graft must include limbocytes (Stem cells) to prevent recurrence.
7.  **Graft Fixation:**
    *   The graft is placed over the bare scleral defect.
    *   **Orientation:** It is vital to maintain proper orientation (limbal side of graft to limbal side of defect).
    *   **Fixation methods:**
        *   **Sutures:** Interrupted 10-0 Nylon or 8-0 Vicryl using a **Needle Holder** and **Plain Forceps**.
        *   **Fibrin Glue:** A biological adhesive (expensive but comfortable).
        *   **Autologous Serum:** Using patient's own blood for adhesion.

## Adjunctive Therapies for Recurrence Prevention
Simple excision (Bare Sclera technique) has a high recurrence rate. Adjuncts used with instruments described above include:

| Method | Description | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CLAU** | Conjunctival Limbal Autograft (Gold Standard) | Replaces diseased tissue with healthy stem cells. |
| **MMC** | [[Mitomycin C]] (0.02%) | Intraoperative application (1-3 mins) inhibits fibroblast proliferation. |
| **AMT** | [[Amniotic Membrane]] Transplantation | Used for large defects or recurrent cases; promotes healing. |
| **Beta-Irradiation** | Post-operative Strontium-90 | Inhibits cell mitosis (historical/less common now). |

### Clinical Implications
*   **Stocker's Line:** Iron deposition seen anterior to the head of the pterygium; indicates a chronic/stable lesion.
*   **Recurrence:** The most challenging aspect of management. Signs of recurrence include fibrovascular growth crossing the limbus again. P.E.R.F.E.C.T. surgery (Pterygium Extended Resection Followed by Extended Conjunctival Transplantation) has the lowest recurrence rate (0.1%).
*   **D/D:** Must be differentiated from [[Pseudopterygium]] (caused by trauma/burns, probe *can* pass underneath the neck).
