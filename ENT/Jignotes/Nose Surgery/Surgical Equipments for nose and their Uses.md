# Surgical Equipments for Nose and Their Uses

## 1. Diagnostic and Exposure Instruments

These instruments are primarily used for visualizing the nasal cavity, examining anatomy, and providing access during procedures.

### A. Nasal Speculums
| Instrument | Features | Uses | Clinical Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Thudichum's Nasal Speculum]]** | U-shaped spring with two flanges. Held by thumb and index finger of non-dominant hand. | • **Anterior Rhinoscopy**<br>• Removal of [[Foreign Bodies]]<br>• Anterior [[Nasal Packing]]<br>• Initial steps of Septoplasty/SMR | Do not touch the sensitive [[Nasal Septum]] mucosa with the blades to avoid pain and bleeding. |
| **[[Killian's Nasal Speculum]]** | Long-bladed, self-retaining with a screw lock mechanism. | • **Deep visualization**<br>• [[Submucous Resection]] (SMR)<br>• [[Septoplasty]]<br>• Keep mucoperiosteal flaps retracted | Allows the surgeon to have both hands free for instrumentation. |
| **St. Clair Thomson Speculum** | Long blades, concave from inside. | • Retracting mucoperiosteal flaps in septal surgery. | Protects flaps from trauma during bone removal. |

### B. Nasal Endoscopes
**Rigid Nasal Endoscopes (Hopkins Rod Lens System)**:
*   **Optics:** Superior illumination and magnification.
*   **Diameters:**
    *   **4.0 mm:** Standard for adults.
    *   **2.7 mm:** For children or narrow nasal cavities.
*   **Angles of View:**
    *   **0° (Green ring):** Straight view. General examination, first pass.
    *   **30° (Red ring):** Forward oblique. Visualizing [[Lateral Nasal Wall]], [[Middle Meatus]], [[Sphenoethmoidal Recess]].
    *   **45° (Black ring) / 70° (Yellow ring):** Visualizing [[Frontal Recess]], [[Maxillary Sinus]] ostium, and lateral recesses.

**[[Diagnostic Nasal Endoscopy]] (DNE):**
Performed in three passes:
1.  **First Pass:** Along nasal floor to [[Nasopharynx]].
2.  **Second Pass:** Into middle meatus to view [[Uncinate Process]], [[Bulla Ethmoidalis]], and [[Ostia]].
3.  **Third Pass:** To examine the [[Sphenoethmoidal Recess]] and [[Olfactory Cleft]].

## 2. Instruments for Septal Surgery ([[Septoplasty]] / SMR)

These tools are essential for elevating flaps and removing deviated bone or cartilage.

### A. Elevators and Knives
*   **[[Freer's Elevator]]**: Double-ended instrument (one sharp, one blunt/rounded).
    *   *Uses:* Elevation of **mucoperichondrial** and **mucoperiosteal flaps** during septal surgery. Also used to medialise turbinates during [[FESS]].
*   **[[Ballenger's Swivel Knife]]**: Bayonet-shaped shaft with a blade that rotates 360° on a swivel.
    *   *Uses:* Excision of quadrangular [[Septal Cartilage]] during SMR.
    *   *Mechanism:* Cuts cartilage in one continuous motion (posteriorly, downwards, then anteriorly).
*   **[[Sickle Knife]]**:
    *   *Uses:* Making incisions in mucosa or incising the [[Uncinate Process]] during FESS.

### B. Bone and Cartilage Removal
*   **[[Luc's Forceps]]**: Fenestrated, cup-shaped blades with a screw joint.
    *   *Uses:*
        *   Removing cartilage/bone in SMR/Septoplasty.
        *   Removing **polyps** (Polypectomy).
        *   **Caldwell-Luc operation** (removing diseased mucosa).
        *   Punch biopsy.
*   **[[Killian's Nasal Gouge]]**: Bayonet-shaped with a V-shaped cutting edge.
    *   *Uses:* Removing **septal spurs**, bony crests, and maxillary crests. Used with a **Mallet**.
*   **[[Turbinectomy Scissors]] (Heymann's)**: Angled scissors with narrow blades.
    *   *Uses:* Partial or total removal of hypertrophied **inferior turbinates**.

## 3. Instruments for Sinus Surgery (Conventional & Endoscopic)

### A. Conventional Antral Procedures
*   **[[Tilley-Lichtwitz Trocar and Cannula]]**:
    *   *Uses:* **Antral Proof Puncture (Lavage)**. Punctures the lateral wall of the **inferior meatus** to irrigate the [[Maxillary Sinus]].
*   **[[Tilley's Harpoon]]**:
    *   *Uses:* Creating an opening in the inferior meatus during **Intranasal Antrostomy**. Designed to withdraw bone chips to prevent them from falling into the sinus.
*   **[[Myle's Nasoantral Perforator]]**:
    *   *Uses:* Perforating the nasoantral wall; has a reverse cutting edge to enlarge the opening.

### B. Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery ([[FESS]]) Tools
These are fine instruments designed to work alongside endoscopes.

*   **[[Blakesley Forceps]]**:
    *   *Types:* Straight, 45°, 90° upturned.
    *   *Uses:* Grasping and removing **polyps**, **uncinate process**, or diseased mucosa from the ethmoids.
*   **[[Takahashi Forceps]]**:
    *   *Uses:* Soft tissue removal, ethmoidectomy.
*   **Backbiting Forceps (Ostrum's/Stammberger's)**:
    *   *Uses:* Enlarging the **maxillary ostium** anteriorly (uncinectomy/antrostomy).
*   **[[Microdebrider]] (Shaver)**:
    *   *Mechanism:* Powered rotary blade with continuous suction.
    *   *Uses:* Precise removal of polyps and soft tissue with minimal bleeding.

## 4. Instruments for Nasal Fracture Reduction

Used for the management of fractured nasal bones and septum.

| Instrument | Description | Specific Use | Mnemonic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Walsham's Forceps]]** | Heavy forceps. Blades may be covered with rubber tubing to protect skin. | Disimpaction and reduction of **Nasal Bones**. | **W**alsham for **W**alls (Bony walls of nose). |
| **[[Asch's Septal Forceps]]** | Angled forceps. Blades do not meet completely (gap prevents crushing). | Straightening and elevating the **Nasal Septum**. | **A**sch for **A**xis (Central septum). |

**Clinical Context:** Closed reduction is typically performed 5-7 days after injury once edema subsides, but before callus formation (up to 3 weeks).

## 5. General and Hemostatic Instruments

*   **[[Tilley's Dressing Forceps]]**:
    *   *Features:* Box joint, bayonet-shaped (offset handle prevents surgeon's hand from blocking vision).
    *   *Uses:* **Nasal packing** (anterior), removal of crusts/foreign bodies.
*   **[[Hartmann's Forceps]]**:
    *   *Features:* Screw joint, serrated jaws. Similar uses to Tilley's.
*   **[[Joseph's Skin Hooks]]**:
    *   *Uses:* Retracting skin margins during **Rhinoplasty** or elevating flaps.
*   **Suction Cannulae (Frazier/Baron)**:
    *   *Uses:* Keeping the surgical field clear of blood and secretions; essential for endoscopic visualization.
