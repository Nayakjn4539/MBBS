# [[Diseases Of Orbit]] > Orbital Blow-out Fracture

# Orbital Blow-out Fracture

### Definition
An **Orbital Blow-out Fracture** is an isolated comminuted fracture of the orbital walls caused by blunt trauma, without the involvement of the orbital rim.
*   **Pure Blow-out Fracture:** Does not involve the orbital rim.
*   **Impure Blow-out Fracture:** Associated with fractures of the orbital rim and other facial bones.

### Etiology and Mechanism
Usually caused by a sudden increase in intraorbital pressure due to a striking object with a diameter **greater than 5 cm** (larger than the orbital entrance), such as a fist, cricket ball, or tennis ball.

**Mechanisms:**
1.  **Hydraulic Theory:** The force is transmitted through the fluid contents of the orbit, raising intraorbital pressure, causing the thin orbital walls to "blow out" into the paranasal sinuses.
2.  **Buckling Theory:** Direct transmission of force to the orbital rim causes buckling of the walls.

**Site of Fracture:**
*   **Orbital Floor (Most Common):** Specifically the posteromedial part (weakest area), involving the [[Maxillary bone]].
*   **Medial Wall:** Formed by the [[Ethmoid bone]] (lamina papyracea); often fractured but less symptomatic due to support from ethmoid air cells.

### Clinical Features
Symptoms often appear after the initial edema subsides (usually around 10 days post-injury).

#### Symptoms
*   **Pain** and local tenderness.
*   **Binocular [[Diplopia]]** (Double vision):
    *   Typically vertical diplopia.
    *   Occurs in upgaze and downgaze ("Double diplopia").
*   **Infraorbital Anesthesia:** Numbness of the lower lid, cheek, side of the nose, and upper lip due to injury to the [[Infraorbital nerve]].
*   **Enophthalmos:** Sunken appearance of the eyeball.
*   **Epistaxis:** Bleeding from the nose (from the maxillary sinus).

#### Signs
1.  **Periocular Signs:** [[Ecchymosis]] (black eye), edema, and subconjunctival hemorrhage.
2.  **Surgical Emphysema:** Crepitus on palpation of eyelids, worsened by blowing the nose (air enters from the sinus).
3.  **Restriction of Ocular Movements:**
    *   Limitation of elevation and depression.
    *   Caused by entrapment of the [[Inferior rectus]] and [[Inferior oblique]] muscles or orbital fat in the fracture site.
4.  **Enophthalmos:**
    *   Displacement of the globe backwards and downwards.
    *   Due to escape of orbital fat into the maxillary antrum and enlargement of the orbital cavity.
5.  **Positive Forced Duction Test (FDT):** Indicates mechanical restriction of the muscle (cannot manually move the eye with forceps).

**[[Clinical Implication]]:** Severe ocular damage is rare in pure blow-out fractures because the fracture itself decompresses the orbit, protecting the globe from rupture. However, a thorough retinal exam is mandatory to rule out [[Retinal detachment]] or [[Commotio retinae]].

### Investigations

| Investigation | Findings |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CT Scan (Choice)** | **Gold Standard**. Visualizes bony fragments, soft tissue herniation, and muscle entrapment. Coronal sections are most useful. |
| **X-Ray (Water's View)** | **[[Tear drop sign]]** or "Hanging drop" opacity: Represents herniation of orbital contents into the maxillary sinus. |
| **Hess Chart** | Documents ocular motility restriction. |
| **Forced Duction Test** | Differentiates restrictive causes (positive test) from paralytic causes of squint. |

### Management

#### 1. Conservative (Medical) Treatment
Initial management is conservative as many cases resolve once swelling decreases.
*   **Observation:** For 10–14 days to allow edema and hemorrhage to subside.
*   **Systemic Antibiotics:** To prevent secondary infection from the sinuses.
*   **Anti-inflammatory drugs/Analgesics:** To reduce swelling and pain.
*   **Nasal Decongestants:** To keep airways clear.
*   **Instructions:** **DO NOT BLOW THE NOSE** (avoids forcing air into the orbit/surgical emphysema).

#### 2. Surgical Management
Surgery is usually performed after **10–14 days**. Waiting too long can lead to fibrosis.

**Indications for Surgery:**
1.  **Persistent Diplopia:** Specifically within 30° of the primary position, not resolving after 2 weeks.
2.  **Significant [[Enophthalmos]]:** Greater than **2-3 mm** (cosmetically unacceptable).
3.  **Large Fracture:** Herniation involving more than half the orbital floor.
4.  **Muscle Entrapment:** Confirmed by CT or Forced Duction Test (specifically entrapment of the [[Inferior rectus]] muscle).

**Surgical Procedures:**
*   **Release of Entrapment:** Dislodging the entrapped muscle and fat from the fracture site.
*   **Orbital Floor Repair:** Restoration of bony continuity using implants.
    *   **Implants used:** Synthetic materials (Silicone, Teflon, Titanium mesh) or Autogenous grafts (Bone from iliac crest or rib).

### Complications
*   **Persistent Diplopia:** Due to muscle fibrosis or nerve damage.
*   **Infraorbital Nerve Hypoesthesia:** Permanent numbness.
*   **[[Enophthalmos]]:** If not adequately repaired.
*   **Ocular Injury:** Though rare, traumatic [[Hyphema]], [[Retinal dialysis]], or [[Vitreous hemorrhage]] can coexist.
