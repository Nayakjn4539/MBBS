### Mechanism of Action
1.  **Stimulation followed by Depression:** It first stimulates and then paralyzes the sensory nerve endings (causing tingling and numbness).
2.  **CNS:** Depresses the Medullary centers.
3.  **Cardiovascular:** Direct toxic action on the myocardium and conduction system, leading to arrhythmias and hypotension.

### Clinical Features
Symptoms usually appear within **10-15 minutes** of ingestion.

**1. Local Symptoms:**
*   **Taste:** Sweetish taste initially (hence the name *Mitha Zahar*), followed by numbness and tingling in the lips, tongue, and mouth.
*   **Sensation:** Feeling of formication (ants crawling) and warmth.

**2. Gastrointestinal:**
*   Severe burning sensation from mouth to stomach.
*   Excessive [[salivation]], nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
*   Dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing).

**3. Neurological:**
*   **Tingling and Numbness:** Spreads from mouth to fingers, toes, and the whole body.
*   **Muscular Weakness:** Great prostration, loss of power in limbs, twitching of muscles.
*   **Mental Status:** The **mind remains clear** until the very end (though the patient may be unable to speak).

**4. Cardiovascular:**
*   Pulse: Slow, weak, and irregular initially; later becomes rapid and imperceptible.
*   BP: Hypotension and shock.
*   Chest pain and palpitations.

**5. Ocular (Specific Sign):**
*   **[[Hippus]]:** Alternate contraction and dilatation of the pupil is a characteristic sign of Aconite poisoning.
*   Visual disturbances (yellow-green vision).

### Comparison: Aconite vs Horseradish
This is a common exam question as accidental poisoning occurs by mistaking Aconite for Horseradish.

| Feature | Aconite Root | Horseradish Root |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shape** | Conical (carrot-like), tapering | Cylindrical, long, non-tapering |
| **Colour** | Dark brown | Pale yellowish/white |
| **Texture** | Friable (breaks easily) | Tough (does not break easily) |
| **Taste** | Sweet then acrid/numbness | Pungent/bitter (no numbness) |
| **Toxicity** | Highly Toxic | Edible (condiment) |

### Fatal Dose and Period
*   **Fatal Dose:**
    *   Root: **1 gm** (approx).
    *   Alkaloid ([[Aconitine]]): **2–5 mg**.
    *   Extract: 250 mg.
*   **Fatal Period:** **2 to 6 hours** (rapid death).

### Management
There is no specific antidote. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

1.  **Decontamination:**
    *   **Gastric Lavage:** With warm water and **Tannic acid** or weak potassium permanganate (1:5000) solution. Tannin precipitates the alkaloid.
    *   Activated Charcoal.
2.  **Symptomatic Treatment:**
    *   **Bradycardia:** [[Atropine]] (1 mg IV/IM) to improve heart rate.
    *   **Hypotension:** Inotropes (Dopamine/Noradrenaline).
    *   **Arrhythmias:** Anti-arrhythmics like Lignocaine or Amiodarone.
3.  **Supportive:**
    *   Keep the patient warm (risk of hypothermia).
    *   Artificial respiration if respiratory failure occurs.
    *   Monitor ECG continuously.

### Post-Mortem Appearances
Findings are generally non-specific (Asphyxial signs).
*   **Smell:** No characteristic smell, but fragments of root may be found in the stomach.
*   **Mucosa:** Congestion and patches of extravasation in the stomach (due to local irritant action).
*   **Viscera:** General congestion of lungs, liver, and kidneys.
*   **Subendocardial Hemorrhages:** May be seen.

### Medicolegal Aspects
1.  **Homicide:** Ideal homicidal poison in the past (known as *Mitha Zahar*), but rare now due to its rapid action and bitter taste. It was historically used to eliminate enemies.
2.  **Suicide:** Occasionally used, though the painful symptoms usually deter this method.
3.  **Accidental:**
    *   Mistaking the root for **Horseradish** (condiment).
    *   Overdose of native medicines (quacks use it for fever/rheumatism).
    *   Consuming liquor adulterated with aconite to increase potency.
4.  **Cattle Poison:** Often used to poison cattle.
5.  **Arrow Poison:** Historically used by hill tribes as arrow poison.

The following prior art methods are available for the preparation of N-cyclopropyl-3-fluoro-4-carboxy quinolinediones of the Formula I. 1. A process described in United States Patent No. 5,342,952 comprises condensing 3-chloro-4-fluoroaniline with diethyl ethoxymethylene malonate (EMME) to obtain ethyl- α-carbethoxy-β-(3-chloro-4-fluoroanilino) acrylate. The acrylate ester is reacted with cyclopropylamine to give ethyl-α-carbethoxy-β-cyclopropylamino-β-(3-chloro-4-fluoroanilino) acrylate which is cyclized by heating with sodium hydride in a solvent to obtain 1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-7-chloro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester. This ester is hydrolyzed to obtain 1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-7-chloro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylic acid. The disadvantage of this process is that the reaction of the acrylate ester with cyclopropylamine requires a long time of 10 to 12 hours at a high temperature of 140 to 150 °C with simultaneous removal of ethanol formed in the reaction and further reaction of the intermediate with sodium hydride is hazardous on a commercial scale. 2. A process described in United States Patent No. 4,620,006 which comprises the reaction of 2,4-dichloro-5-fluorobenzoic acid with thionyl chloride to give the corresponding benzoyl chloride. The benzoyl chloride is reacted with diethyl malonate and magnesium ethoxide in ether to obtain diethyl 2,4-dichloro-5-fluorobenzoyl malonate. This malonate derivative is partially hydrolyzed and decarboxylated using p-toluene sulfonic acid and water to obtain ethyl 2,4-dichloro-5-fluorobenzoyl acetate. This ethyl benzoyl acetate derivative is condensed with triethyl orthoformate and acetic anhydride to give ethyl-2-(2,4-dichloro-5-fluorobenzoyl)-3-ethoxy acrylate. This acrylate derivative is treated with cyclopropylamine to give ethyl-2-(2,4-dichloro-5-fluorobenzoyl)-3-cyclopropylamino acrylate. This intermediate is cyclized with sodium hydride in tetrahydrofuran to give ethyl 1-cyclopropyl-7-chloro-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylate. This ester is hydrolyzed to the corresponding acid. The disadvantage of this process is that magnesium ethoxide and sodium hydride are flammable, hazardous, expensive and difficult to handle on a commercial scale. Further, ether and tetrahydrofuran are hazardous solvents and their recovery on a commercial scale is dangerous due to peroxide formation. 3. A process described in United States Patent No. 4,987,232 and United States Patent No. 5,166,348 which comprises the reaction of 2,4-dichloro-5-fluorobenzoyl chloride with ethyl-3-dimethylamino acrylate in the presence of a base to give ethyl-2-(2,4-dichloro-5-fluorobenzoyl)-3-dimethylamino acrylate. This intermediate is treated with cyclopropylamine to give ethyl-2-(2,4-dichloro-5-fluorobenzoyl)-3-cyclopropylamino acrylate. This intermediate is cyclized with a base to give ethyl 1-cyclopropyl-7-chloro-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylate. This process has a disadvantage in that the starting material ethyl-3-dimethylamino acrylate is not commercially available and has to be prepared from ethyl propiolate and dimethylamine or from ethyl acetate, sodium hydride and carbon monoxide or from ethyl formyl acetate and dimethylamine. These methods involve hazardous and expensive raw materials. Further, the condensation of 2,4-dichloro-5-fluorobenzoyl chloride with ethyl-3-dimethylamino acrylate requires a long time of 20 hours at a high temperature of 100-110 °C. 4. A process described in United States Patent No. 5,091,533 which comprises the reaction of 2,4-dichloro-5-fluorobenzoyl chloride with ethyl dimethylamino acrylate in the presence of a base to give ethyl 2-(2,4-dichloro-5-fluorobenzoyl)-3-dimethylamino acrylate. This intermediate is reacted with cyclopropylamine to give ethyl 2-(2,4-dichloro-5-fluorobenzoyl)-3-cyclopropylamino acrylate. This intermediate is cyclized with 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) to give ethyl 1-cyclopropyl-7-chloro-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylate. The disadvantages of this process are the use of the expensive and difficult to procure starting material, ethyl 3-dimethylamino acrylate, as discussed above and the use of the expensive base DBU. 5. A process described in United States Patent No. 5,235,055 which comprises the reaction of 2,4-dichloro-5-fluorobenzoic acid with phosgene to give the corresponding acid chloride. The acid chloride is reacted with ethyl hydrogen malonate in the presence of n-butyl lithium to give ethyl 2,4-dichloro-5-fluorobenzoyl acetate. This beta-ketoester is condensed with triethyl orthoformate and acetic anhydride to give ethyl 2-(2,4-dichloro-5-fluorobenzoyl)-3-ethoxy acrylate. This acrylate is reacted with cyclopropylamine to give ethyl 2-(2,4-dichloro-5-fluorobenzoyl)-3-cyclopropylamino acrylate. This intermediate is cyclized with potassium carbonate to give ethyl 1-cyclopropyl-7-chloro-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylate. The disadvantage of this process is that the condensation of 2,4-dichloro-5-fluorobenzoyl chloride with ethyl hydrogen malonate requires n-butyl lithium at a low temperature of -60 °C to -50 °C and an inert atmosphere which is difficult to maintain on a commercial scale. Further, n-butyl lithium is flammable, hazardous, expensive and difficult to handle on a commercial scale. Also, phosgene is a toxic gas and its handling on a commercial scale is hazardous. 6. A process described in United States Patent No. 5,347,008 which comprises the reaction of 2,4-dichloro-5-fluorobenzoyl chloride with ethyl 3-cyclopropylamino acrylate in the presence of a base to give ethyl 2-(2,4-dichloro-5-fluorobenzoyl)-3-cyclopropylamino acrylate. This intermediate is cyclized with a base to give ethyl 1-cyclopropyl-7-chloro-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylate. The disadvantage of this process is that the starting material ethyl 3-cyclopropylamino acrylate is not commercially available and has to be prepared from ethyl propiolate and cyclopropylamine or from ethyl 3-ethoxyacrylate and cyclopropylamine. Ethyl propiolate is expensive and not easily available. Ethyl 3-ethoxy acrylate is prepared from ethyl acetate, sodium hydride, carbon monoxide and ethanol. This method involves hazardous and expensive raw materials. Further, the condensation of 2,4-dichloro-5-fluorobenzoyl chloride with ethyl 3-cyclopropylamino acrylate requires a long time of 18-20 hours at a high temperature of 90-100 °C. The objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for preparing N-cyclopropyl-3-fluoro-4-carboxy quinolinediones of the Formula I which is simple, economical, safe and high yielding. According to the present invention, there is provided an improved process for preparing N-cyclopropyl-3-fluoro-4-carboxy quinolinediones of the Formula I wherein X and Y are selected from hydrogen, halogen, C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> alkyl, C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> alkoxy, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, nitro, cyano, carboxy, carbalkoxy, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy and phenyl which comprises: i) reacting a substituted benzoic acid of the Formula II wherein X and Y have the same meaning as defined above, with thionyl chloride to give the corresponding acid chloride of the Formula III wherein X and Y have the same meaning as defined above; ii) reacting the acid chloride of the Formula III with a malonate ester of the Formula IV wherein R is C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> alkyl, in the presence of magnesium chloride and a base to give a benzoyl malonate of the Formula V wherein X, Y and R have the same meaning as defined above; iii) partially hydrolyzing and decarboxylating the benzoyl malonate of the Formula V using an acid catalyst in water to give a benzoyl acetate of the Formula VI wherein X, Y and R have the same meaning as defined above; iv) condensing the benzoyl acetate of the Formula VI with a trialkyl orthoformate of the Formula VII wherein R' is C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> alkyl, in the presence of acetic anhydride to give an alkoxy acrylate of the Formula VIII wherein X, Y, R and R' have the same meaning as defined above; v) reacting the alkoxy acrylate of the Formula VIII with cyclopropylamine to give a cyclopropylamino acrylate of the Formula IX wherein X, Y and R have the same meaning as defined above; vi) cyclizing the cyclopropylamino acrylate of the Formula IX in the presence of a base to give a quinoline carboxylate of the Formula X wherein X, Y and R have the same meaning as defined above; and vii) hydrolyzing the quinoline carboxylate of the Formula X using an acid or base catalyst to give the N-cyclopropyl-3-fluoro-4-carboxy quinolinedione of the Formula I. The substituted benzoic acid of the Formula II can be prepared by known methods (U.S. Patent No. 4,935,518; European Patent No. 360,266). The reaction of the substituted benzoic acid of the Formula II with thionyl chloride can be carried out in the presence or absence of a solvent at a temperature of 50-80 °C.

The malonate ester can be used in an amount of 1 to 2 moles per mole of the acid chloride. The base can be used in an amount of 2 to 4 moles per mole of the acid chloride. The partial hydrolysis and decarboxylation of the benzoyl malonate of the Formula V can be carried out using an acid catalyst in water at a temperature of 50-100 °C. The acid catalyst can be selected from p-toluene sulfonic acid, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid and acetic acid. The acid catalyst can be used in an amount of 0.01 to 0.5 moles per mole of the benzoyl malonate. The condensation of the benzoyl acetate of the Formula VI with the trialkyl orthoformate of the Formula VII can be carried out in the presence of acetic anhydride at a temperature of 80-140 °C. The trialkyl orthoformate can be selected from trimethyl orthoformate, triethyl orthoformate and tripropyl orthoformate. The trialkyl orthoformate can be used in an amount of 1 to 3 moles per mole of the benzoyl acetate. The acetic anhydride can be used in an amount of 2 to 5 moles per mole of the benzoyl acetate. The reaction of the alkoxy acrylate of the Formula VIII with cyclopropylamine can be carried out in a solvent such as toluene, benzene, ethanol, methanol or isopropanol at a temperature of 0-50 °C. The cyclopropylamine can be used in an amount of 1 to 1.5 moles per mole of the alkoxy acrylate. The cyclization of the cyclopropylamino acrylate of the Formula IX can be carried out in a solvent such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, dimethylsulfoxide or sulfolane in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate or sodium hydride at a temperature of 80-140 °C. The base can be used in an amount of 1 to 3 moles per mole of the cyclopropylamino acrylate.
