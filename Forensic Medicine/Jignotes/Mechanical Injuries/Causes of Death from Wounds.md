# [[Mechanical Injuries]] > Causes of Death from Wounds

### Classification of Causes of Death from Wounds

The causes of death following mechanical injuries are broadly classified based on the time interval between the injury and death:

1.  **Immediate (Direct) Causes:** Occur instantly or within minutes/hours.
    *   [[Hemorrhage]] leading to Shock.
    *   Injury to [[Vital Organs]] (Brain, Heart, Lungs).
    *   Reflex Vagal Inhibition.
    *   [[Shock]] (Primary/Neurogenic and Secondary/Hypovolemic).
2.  **Delayed (Indirect/Remote) Causes:** Occur days or weeks later.
    *   Complications of injury (e.g., [[Embolism]], Aspiration pneumonia).
    *   [[Infection]] (Sepsis, Tetanus, Gangrene).
    *   Neglect of the injured person.
    *   Surgical interventions.

### 1. Hemorrhage
Hemorrhage is the escape of blood from the cardiovascular system. It is the most common cause of death in mechanical injuries.

#### Types of Hemorrhage (Based on Timing)
| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Primary** | Occurs immediately at the time of injury. |
| **Reactionary** | Occurs within 24 hours (usually 4–6 hours). Due to dislodgement of clot, restoration of BP, or slippage of ligature. |
| **Secondary** | Occurs after 7–14 days. Due to infection/sloughing of the vessel wall or dissolution of the clot. |

#### Mechanism of Death
1.  **Hypovolemic Shock:** Rapid loss of **1/3rd (33%)** to **40%** of total blood volume is usually fatal. Children and elderly succumb to smaller losses.
2.  **Mechanical Interference (Vital Function):**
    *   **[[Cardiac Tamponade]]:** Accumulation of 300–400 ml of blood in the pericardial sac constricts the heart, preventing diastolic filling.
    *   **Intracranial Hemorrhage:** A small amount of blood in the medulla can be fatal due to pressure on vital centers. [[Subdural Hematoma]] or [[Extradural Hemorrhage]] causes cerebral compression.
    *   **Asphyxia:** Bleeding into the trachea/bronchi (e.g., cut throat) acts as a mechanical barrier causing the victim to "drown in their own blood".

**Medicolegal Aspects:**
*   A very guarded opinion should be given regarding how long a victim lived after receiving a fatal injury.
*   Victims with severe heart wounds (e.g., right ventricle perforation) may retain the capacity for voluntary acts (walking, speaking) for a short duration before collapsing (verified by **"Volitional Acts"** concept).

### 2. Embolism
An embolus is a foreign body moving in the bloodstream which becomes impacted in a vessel too small to let it pass.

#### A. Air Embolism
Entry of air into the circulatory system.

**Types:**
1.  **Venous Air Embolism (Pulmonary):**
    *   **Causes:** Incised wounds of the neck (cutting External Jugular Vein), [[Criminal Abortion]] (pumping air into the uterus), intravenous injections/transfusions, pneumothorax.
    *   **Mechanism:** Air enters veins -> Right Heart -> Churning with blood forms froth -> Blocks pulmonary outflow tract -> **Acute Cor Pulmonale** (Right Heart Failure).
    *   **Fatal Dose:** **>100 ml** of air (approx. 100–150 ml) introduced rapidly.
    *   **Clinical Sign:** A "churning" or "mill-wheel" murmur heard over the precordium.

2.  **Arterial Air Embolism (Systemic):**
    *   **Causes:** Pulmonary trauma, paradoxically through a patent foramen ovale.
    *   **Mechanism:** Air enters systemic circulation -> Blocks coronary or cerebral arteries.
    *   **Fatal Dose:** Very small amounts (**~1-2 ml**) can be fatal if it occludes coronaries or brainstem vessels.

**Autopsy Findings:**
*   **Froth:** Fine, lathery froth in the Right Ventricle and Pulmonary Artery.
*   **[[Pyrogallol Test]]:** Confirmatory test. 2% Pyrogallol is injected into the heart chamber under water; air turns the solution **brown**.
*   **Technique:** The heart is opened *under water* (or water poured into the pericardial sac before opening the heart) to visualize escaping air bubbles.

#### B. Fat Embolism
Blockage of blood vessels by fat globules.

*   **Causes:**
    *   Fracture of long bones (Femur, Tibia).
    *   Severe crushing injuries to subcutaneous fat.
    *   Fatty liver trauma.
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   *Mechanical Theory:* Mobilization of marrow fat into open veins.
    *   *Biochemical Theory:* Stress induces physicochemical alteration of blood lipids (chylomicrons coalesce).
*   **Clinical Features (Classic Triad):**
    1.  **Respiratory:** Dyspnea, cyanosis (Pulmonary distress).
    2.  **Cerebral:** Confusion, drowsiness, coma.
    3.  **Cutaneous:** **Petechial hemorrhages** (rash) over the chest, axilla, and neck (pathognomonic sign).
*   **Fatal Period:** Usually **24 to 72 hours** after injury (Lucid interval is often present).

**Autopsy Findings:**
*   **Lungs:** Voluminous, heavy, mottled (marbled appearance).
*   **Brain:** Petechial hemorrhages in white matter.
*   **Microscopy:** Needs frozen section. Stains used are **Sudan III** (orange), **Sudan IV** (red), or **Oil Red O** (red).

#### C. Thromboembolism (Pulmonary Embolism)
*   **Cause:** Deep Vein Thrombosis ([[DVT]]) in leg veins (calves) due to prolonged immobilization (stasis) after trauma/surgery.
*   **Mechanism:** A large clot detaches -> Travels to lungs -> Blocks Pulmonary Artery bifurcation (Saddle Embolus) -> Sudden death due to reflex vagal inhibition or acute right heart failure.
*   **Autopsy Finding:** The embolus is cylindrical, granular, brittle, and shows **Lines of Zahn** (layers of platelets/fibrin).

**Mnemonic for Fat Embolism Syndrome:** **FAT**
*   **F** - Fat in urine/sputum
*   **A** - Anemia/Thrombocytopenia
*   **T** - Tachypnea/Dyspnea (Respiratory distress)

**Differentiation: Antemortem vs. Postmortem Clot**

| Feature | Antemortem Thrombus/Embolus | Postmortem Clot |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Consistency** | Firm, dry, friable (brittle) | Soft, moist, jelly-like ("Chicken fat" or "Currant jelly") |
| **Structure** | Laminated (**Lines of Zahn**) | Homogeneous |
| **Attachment** | Adherent to vessel wall | Non-adherent (loose) |
| **Shape** | Shape of the vessel it *formed* in | Shape of the vessel it is *found* in |

### 3. Infection
Death occurring days or weeks after the injury due to microbial invasion.

*   **Causes:**
    *   Contamination of wounds (soil, clothing, foreign bodies).
    *   Introduction of organisms during invasive procedures (catheters, surgery).
    *   Lowered resistance of the victim.
*   **Common Infections:**
    *   **[[Tetanus]]:** Caused by *Clostridium tetani*. Common in lacerated/puncture wounds contaminated with soil/rust.
    *   **Gas Gangrene:** Caused by *Clostridium welchii*. Seen in extensive crushing injuries with devitalized tissue.
    *   **Septicemia/Bacteremia:** Systemic spread of infection (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus) leading to Septic Shock.
    *   **Meningitis:** Following compound fractures of the skull.
    *   **Peritonitis:** Following penetrating abdominal injuries.

**Medicolegal Aspects (Novus Actus Interveniens):**
*   If a victim dies from a distinct infection (like scarlet fever in a hospital) unrelated to the wound, the assailant may not be held fully responsible for murder.
*   However, if the infection is a *direct complication* of the injury (e.g., peritonitis from a stab wound or tetanus from a rusty weapon), the assailant **is responsible** for the death, as the injury initiated the chain of events.

---

### Summary of Other Causes (Briefly)
*   **Crush Syndrome:** Traumatic rhabdomyolysis -> Myoglobinuria -> Acute Renal Failure (renal tubules blocked by acid hematin).
*   **Suprarenal Hemorrhage:** Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome following trauma/sepsis.
*   **Neglect:** Failure to seek medical aid or improper treatment.
