# [[Diseases Of Conjunctiva]] > Xerophthalmia

### Xerophthalmia

**Xerophthalmia** is the term reserved by the WHO to cover all ocular manifestations of [[Vitamin A deficiency]], including structural changes affecting the conjunctiva, cornea, and retina, as well as biophysical disorders of retinal rod and cone function. It is a major cause of preventable childhood blindness in developing countries.

#### Etiology and Pathophysiology
*   **Primary Cause:** Dietary deficiency of [[Vitamin A]] (Retinol) or defective absorption from the gut.
*   **Associations:** It is rarely an isolated problem; it is almost always accompanied by **Protein-Energy Malnutrition (PEM)** and infections (e.g., Measles, Diarrhea).
*   **Pathology:**
    *   Vitamin A is essential for the maintenance of epithelial tissues (especially mucus-secreting goblet cells) and the synthesis of [[rhodopsin]] (visual purple) in the retina.
    *   Deficiency leads to **squamous metaplasia** of the epithelium (keratinization) and atrophy of [[goblet cells]], leading to loss of mucin and surface dryness.

### WHO Classification of Xerophthalmia (1982)

This classification is crucial for grading the severity of the disease.

| Stage | Description | Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **XN** | **Night Blindness** (Nyctalopia) | Earliest symptom. Due to impaired dark adaptation (rod dysfunction). |
| **X1A** | **Conjunctival Xerosis** | First clinical sign. Dryness of conjunctiva. |
| **X1B** | **Bitot's Spots** | Foamy, triangular spots on the conjunctiva. |
| **X2** | **Corneal Xerosis** | Dryness extending to the cornea. |
| **X3A** | **Keratomalacia** (< 1/3) | Corneal ulceration/necrosis involving less than 1/3 of the corneal surface. |
| **X3B** | **Keratomalacia** (> 1/3) | Corneal ulceration/necrosis involving more than 1/3 of the corneal surface. |
| **XS** | **Corneal Scar** | Healed sequelae of corneal involvement. |
| **XF** | **Xerophthalmic Fundus** | Retinal lesions (speckled fundus). |

> **Mnemonic for WHO Classification:**
> **N**ight **C**ats **B**ite **C**orn **K**ernels **S**caring **F**armers
> *   **N** - Night blindness (XN)
> *   **C** - Conjunctival xerosis (X1A)
> *   **B** - Bitot's spots (X1B)
> *   **C** - Corneal xerosis (X2)
> *   **K** - Keratomalacia (X3A/B)

### Clinical Features and Stages

#### 1. Night Blindness (XN)
*   The earliest symptom.
*   The child cannot see in dim light (e.g., stumbles at dusk).
*   Caused by a deficiency in the regeneration of [[rhodopsin]].

#### 2. Conjunctival Xerosis (X1A)
*   Patches of dry, lustreless, non-wettable conjunctiva.
*   Described as "emerging like sandbanks at receding tide".
*   Usually involves the interpalpebral area (temporal quadrants first, then nasal).
*   Associated with conjunctival thickening, wrinkling, and pigmentation.

#### 3. Bitot's Spots (X1B) > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Triangular, foamy white patch lateral to limbus
*   **Appearance:** Raised, silvery-white, foamy, triangular patch of keratinized epithelium.
*   **Location:** Usually on the **bulbar conjunctiva** near the limbus, mostly **temporal**.
*   **Pathogenesis:** The foamy appearance is due to gas production by **[[Corynebacterium xerosis]]** which infests the keratinized epithelium.

#### 4. Corneal Xerosis (X2)
*   The cornea becomes dull, dry, and lustreless (loss of sheen).
*   Usually starts in the lower nasal quadrant as punctate keratopathy.
*   The surface appears granular or pebbly.

#### 5. Keratomalacia (X3A and X3B)
*   **Pathology:** **[[Colliquative necrosis]]**. The cornea becomes dull, insensitive, and essentially "melts away" within hours.
*   **Clinical Characteristic:** It is a **non-inflammatory** condition (white eye).
*   **X3A:** Ulceration involving < 1/3 of the cornea. May heal with some useful vision.
*   **X3B:** Ulceration involving > 1/3 of the cornea. Usually results in total blindness/perforation.

#### 6. Corneal Scarring (XS)
*   Healed sequelae of ulceration. Can range from nebula to leucoma or anterior staphyloma.

#### 7. Xerophthalmic Fundus (XF)
*   Typical seed-like, raised, whitish lesions scattered uniformly over the fundus.

### Treatment

Xerophthalmia is a medical emergency requiring immediate administration of Vitamin A.

#### 1. Systemic Vitamin A Schedule (WHO Protocol)
The standard treatment involves three doses:
1.  **Immediately** on diagnosis (Day 0).
2.  **The following day** (Day 1).
3.  **2 to 4 weeks later** (Day 14 or 28).

**Dosage Table:**

| Patient Group | Dosage (Oral) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **> 1 Year or > 8 kg** | 200,000 IU (Red Capsule) |
| **< 1 Year or < 8 kg** | 100,000 IU (Blue Capsule) |
| **Women of Reproductive Age*** | 10,000 IU daily for 2 weeks |

*(**Note:** For women of reproductive age with severe corneal disease (X2, X3), the full dose of 200,000 IU is given to prevent blindness, weighing the risk of teratogenicity against vision loss).*

**Route:** Oral is preferred. If there is severe vomiting/diarrhea, intramuscular (IM) water-miscible injections are used (dose is reduced by 50%, e.g., 100,000 IU instead of 200,000 IU).

#### 2. Local Ocular Therapy
*   **Artificial tears** (e.g., Methylcellulose) every 3–4 hours for xerosis.
*   **Topical antibiotics** for keratomalacia to prevent secondary bacterial infection (treated like bacterial corneal ulcer).
*   **Bandaging** the eye if there is risk of perforation.

#### 3. General Management
*   Correction of **Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM)**.
*   Treatment of underlying infections (diarrhea, measles, worms).

### Prophylaxis (Prevention)

The "National Programme for Control of Blindness" in India includes Vitamin A prophylaxis.

**Universal Immunization Schedule:**
*   **1st Dose:** 100,000 IU (1 ml) at **9 months** of age (along with Measles vaccine).
*   **2nd Dose:** 200,000 IU (2 ml) at **16–18 months** (with DPT/OPV booster).
*   **Subsequent Doses:** 200,000 IU every **6 months** up to 5 years of age.
*   **Total Doses:** 9 doses in total by age 5.

**Dietary Sources:** Promotion of colostrum feeding, green leafy vegetables (spinach), yellow fruits (papaya, mango), carrots, and drumsticks.

**Clinical Implication:**
Keratomalacia is a "quiet" necrosis. The eye may look relatively white (non-inflamed) while the cornea is melting. Do not mistake the lack of redness for a benign condition; it requires urgent Vitamin A therapy to save the eye.
