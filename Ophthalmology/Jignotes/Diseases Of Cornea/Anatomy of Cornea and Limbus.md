# Anatomy of Cornea and Limbus

## I. General Features of the Cornea
The [[Cornea]] is the clear, transparent, anterior one-sixth of the outer fibrous coat of the eyeball. It acts as the major refractive surface of the eye.

### Dimensions and Curvature
*   **Shape:** It is **prolate spheroid** (aspherical). From the anterior view, it is elliptical horizontally and circular vertically. From the posterior view, it is circular.
*   **Diameters:**
    *   Anterior Horizontal: **11.7 mm** (Average).
    *   Anterior Vertical: **11 mm**.
    *   Posterior: **11.5 mm** (Circular).
*   **Thickness:**
    *   Central: **0.52 mm (520–540 $\mu$m)**.
    *   Peripheral: **0.67 mm (1–1.2 mm)** (Thicker at the periphery).
*   **Radius of Curvature:**
    *   Anterior: **7.8 mm**.
    *   Posterior: **6.5 mm**.
*   **Refractive Power:** Approximately **+43 to +45 Diopters** (constitutes about 70-75% of the total refractive power of the eye).
*   **Refractive Index:** **1.376**.

### Physiology of Transparency
The cornea remains transparent due to a balance of anatomical and physiological factors:
1.  **Anatomical Factors:**
    *   Avascularity.
    *   Non-keratinized epithelium.
    *   Regular lattice arrangement of stromal [[Collagen fibrils]] (Maurice’s Lattice Theory).
    *   Uniform refractive index of all layers.
2.  **Physiological Factors:**
    *   Relative dehydration (maintained by endothelial pumps).
    *   Evaporation from the tear film.

## II. Microscopic Anatomy (Layers of Cornea)
The cornea consists of **six** distinct layers (from anterior to posterior).

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Cross-section of the cornea showing 6 layers: Epithelium, Bowman's layer, Stroma, Dua's layer, Descemet's membrane, Endothelium

### 1. Epithelium
*   **Structure:** Stratified squamous non-keratinized epithelium.
*   **Thickness:** 50–90 $\mu$m (5–6 layers of cells).
*   **Cell Types:**
    *   **Superficial cells:** Flat cells with **microvilli** to retain the tear film.
    *   **Wing cells (Intermediate):** Polyhedral cells (2-3 layers).
    *   **Basal cells:** Single layer of columnar cells attached to the basement membrane by hemidesmosomes. These are the only cells capable of mitosis.
*   **Turnover:** The epithelium regenerates rapidly (every 7 days).
*   **Clinical Implication:** Damage limited to the epithelium (e.g., abrasion) heals **without scarring**.

### 2. Bowman’s Layer (Anterior Limiting Lamina)
*   **Structure:** Acellular, condensed sheet of collagen fibrils (Type I and V).
*   **Thickness:** 8–14 $\mu$m.
*   **Nature:** It is **not** a true basement membrane (PAS negative).
*   **Regeneration:** It **cannot regenerate**.
*   **Clinical Implication:** Injury to this layer results in **scar formation** (Nebula, Macula, or Leucoma depending on density).

### 3. Stroma (Substantia Propria)
*   **Structure:** Constitutes **90%** of corneal thickness (approx. 500 $\mu$m).
*   **Composition:**
    *   **Collagen fibrils:** Primarily **Type I** (also Type V and VI), arranged in lamellae.
    *   **Keratocytes:** Modified fibroblasts.
    *   **Ground Substance:** Proteoglycans/Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). The major GAG is **Keratan Sulfate** (lumican), followed by Chondroitin sulfate (decorin).
*   **Arrangement:** Lamellae are arranged at right angles to each other in a regular lattice pattern, essential for transparency.

### 4. Dua’s Layer (Pre-Descemet’s Layer)
*   **Discovery:** Described by Dr. Harminder Dua in 2013.
*   **Structure:** A thin (6.5–13.9 $\mu$m), acellular, very strong layer between the stroma and Descemet’s membrane.
*   **Properties:** It is impervious to air.
*   **Clinical Implication:** Crucial in **Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (DALK)**. The "Big Bubble" technique separates the stroma from this layer.

### 5. Descemet’s Membrane (Posterior Limiting Lamina)
*   **Structure:** True basement membrane of the endothelium.
*   **Composition:** **Type IV collagen**.
*   **Thickness:** Increases with age (3 $\mu$m at birth to 10–12 $\mu$m in adults).
*   **Regeneration:** Can be regenerated by endothelial cells.
*   **Peripheral Termination:** Ends at the **[[Schwalbe’s line]]**.
*   **Clinical Implication:** It is very resistant to chemical agents and autolysis. In severe corneal ulcers, the stroma may melt, but this membrane bulges out, forming a **[[Descemetocele]]**.

### 6. Endothelium
*   **Structure:** Single layer of hexagonal, metabolically active cells.
*   **Function:** Contains **Na+/K+ ATPase pumps** to maintain corneal dehydration (deturgescence).
*   **Cell Density:**
    *   At birth: ~6000 cells/mm².
    *   Young adult: **2500–3000 cells/mm²**.
    *   Critical count for decompensation: **<500 cells/mm²**.
*   **Regeneration:** Human endothelial cells **do not regenerate**. They compensate for cell loss by spreading (enlargement) and sliding.
*   **Investigations:** Examined via **[[Specular Microscopy]]**.
    *   **Polymegathism:** Variation in cell size.
    *   **Pleomorphism:** Variation in cell shape.

| Layer | Regenerates? | Key Feature | Pathology Association |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Epithelium** | **Yes** | Lipophilic, Microvilli | Abrasions heal w/o scar |
| **Bowman's** | **No** | Acellular, Type I Collagen | Scarring (Opacity) |
| **Stroma** | **Yes** (Scar) | 90% Thickness, Type I Collagen | Keratoconus, Ectasia |
| **Dua's** | No | Very Strong, Impervious to air | DALK Surgery |
| **Descemet's** | **Yes** | Type IV Collagen, Elastic | Descemetocele, Wilson's (KF Ring)|
| **Endothelium**| **No** | Na+/K+ Pump, Hexagonal | Fuch's Dystrophy, Bullous Keratopathy |

## III. Nerve Supply
The cornea is one of the most sensitive tissues in the body.
*   **Nerve:** **Ophthalmic division** of the **[[Trigeminal Nerve]]** (CN V).
*   **Pathway:** Trigeminal nerve $\rightarrow$ Nasociliary nerve $\rightarrow$ Long Ciliary nerves.
*   **Pattern:** Nerves enter the stroma, lose their myelin sheath (to maintain transparency), and form a sub-epithelial plexus.
*   **Clinical Implication:** **Neurotrophic Keratopathy** occurs due to loss of corneal sensation (e.g., after Herpes Zoster, Diabetes, or surgery).

---

## IV. Blood Supply and Metabolism
*   **Vascularity:** The normal cornea is **avascular** (to maintain transparency).
*   **Nutrition Sources:**
    1.  **Aqueous Humour:** Main source of glucose and amino acids (via endothelium).
    2.  **Tears:** Main source of Oxygen (atmospheric oxygen dissolves in tears).
    3.  **Limbal Capillaries:** Minor contribution (peripheral cornea).
*   **Metabolism:**
    *   **Epithelium:** Aerobic glycolysis (Krebs cycle).
    *   **Stroma:** Anaerobic glycolysis.
    *   **Implication:** Contact lens wear creates hypoxia $\rightarrow$ shift to anaerobic metabolism $\rightarrow$ lactic acid accumulation $\rightarrow$ **Corneal Edema**.

## V. Anatomy of the Limbus
The **[[Limbus]]** is the transition zone between the cornea, sclera, and conjunctiva.

### Key Anatomical Features
1.  **Structure:** It is a grey, semitransparent zone about 1-1.5 mm wide.
2.  **Blood Supply:** Derived from the **Anterior Ciliary Arteries** which form the **Marginal Loops of the Cornea**. These invade the corneal periphery for about 1mm.
3.  **Stem Cells:** The limbal basal epithelium contains **[[Limbal Stem Cells]]** (LSC).
    *   **Location:** **Palisades of Vogt** (radial ridges at the limbus).
    *   **Function:** Regeneration of corneal epithelium and acting as a barrier to prevent conjunctival epithelium from growing over the cornea.
    *   **Markers:** **ABCG2**, **p63**, and **CD34** (universal stem cell marker).

### Clinical Implications of Limbus
*   **Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency (LSCD):** Caused by chemical burns or Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Leads to conjunctivalization of the cornea (pannus), loss of transparency, and persistent epithelial defects.
*   **Surgical Landmark:** It serves as a critical landmark for incisions in cataract (SICS/Phaco) and glaucoma surgeries.
