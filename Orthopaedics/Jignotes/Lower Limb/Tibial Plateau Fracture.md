# [[Lower Limb]] > Tibial Plateau Fracture

### Tibial Plateau Fracture (Bumper/Fender Fracture)

**Tibial plateau fractures** involve the articular surface of the [[proximal tibia]]. They are critical injuries because they affect the knee joint alignment, stability, and motion. Due to the subcutaneous nature of the tibia and the high energy often involved, these fractures pose significant challenges regarding soft tissue management and articular reconstruction.

#### Mechanism of Injury
*   **High Energy Trauma:** Often seen in road traffic accidents (pedestrians hit by cars) or falls from height.
    *   **Bumper Fracture/Fender Fracture:** caused by a direct blow from a vehicle bumper to the side of the knee,.
*   **Axial Loading:** A combination of axial compression and varus or valgus force.
    *   **Valgus force:** Drives the [[femoral condyle]] into the tibial plateau, causing a split or depression.
*   **Low Energy:** Can occur in elderly osteoporotic patients with simple falls.

#### Relevant Anatomy
*   The tibial plateau consists of the medial and lateral condyles separated by the [[intercondylar eminence]].
*   **Lateral Condyle:** Convex and weaker; fractured more frequently (55–70%).
*   **Medial Condyle:** Concave and stronger; requires higher energy to fracture (10–23%). Fracture here has a higher association with neurovascular injury.
*   **Neurovascular Structures:** The [[popliteal artery]] runs posteriorly, and the [[common peroneal nerve]] winds around the fibular neck laterally.

#### Classification: Schatzker Classification
This is the most widely used system, dividing fractures based on the location and pattern,.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Drawing of the 6 types of Schatzker classification

| Type | Description | Mechanism/Severity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type I** | **Lateral Split wedge**: A vertical split of the lateral condyle without depression. | Low Energy (Valgus force) |
| **Type II** | **Split + Depression**: Lateral split combined with depression of the articular surface. | Low Energy |
| **Type III** | **Pure Depression**: Focal depression of the lateral articular surface with an intact rim. | Low Energy (Common in osteoporotic bone) |
| **Type IV** | **Medial Condyle Fracture**: Can be split or depressed. **High risk of NV injury.** | High Energy (Varus force) |
| **Type V** | **Bicondylar Fracture**: Involves both medial and lateral condyles. The metaphysis and diaphysis are intact. | High Energy |
| **Type VI** | **Dissociation**: Bicondylar fracture with separation of the metaphysis from the diaphysis. | High Energy (Most severe) |

**Mnemonic for Schatzker:**
*   **S**plit (I)
*   **S**plit + **D**epression (II)
*   **D**epression (III)
*   **M**edial (IV)
*   **B**icondylar (V)
*   **D**issociation (VI)
*(Think: **S**top **S**plitting **D**own **M**y **B**ig **D**inner)*

#### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:** Severe pain, inability to weight-bear, and swelling.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Swelling:** Usually gross due to [[haemarthrosis]]. The knee feels "doughy".
    *   **Deformity:** Varus or valgus deformity may be apparent.
    *   **Tenderness:** Diffuse, but maximal over the fracture line.
    *   **Skin Condition:** Look for abrasions, open wounds, or blistering (signs of severe soft tissue injury).
    *   **Neurovascular Status:** Mandatory check of distal pulses ([[dorsalis pedis artery]], [[posterior tibial artery]]) and sensation/motor function (exclude **foot drop** from peroneal nerve injury).

#### Diagnostic Imaging
1.  **X-rays:**
    *   **AP and Lateral views:** Standard initial assessment.
    *   **Intercondylar/Tunnel view:** Helpful to see the intercondylar notch.
    *   **Traction views:** May help delineate fragments in comminuted fractures.
2.  **CT Scan:**
    *   **Gold Standard** for surgical planning.
    *   Essential to evaluate the extent of **articular depression**, comminution, and fracture geometry (3D reconstruction),.
3.  **MRI:**
    *   Used to detect associated soft tissue injuries: [[meniscal tear]] (very common), [[anterior cruciate ligament]] (ACL) injury, or medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury,.

#### Principles of Management
**Goal:** Restore articular congruity, axial alignment, and joint stability to allow early range of motion (ROM) and prevent osteoarthritis.

**1. Conservative Management**
*   **Indications:**
    *   Undisplaced fractures.
    *   Minimally displaced fractures (Articular step-off < 2mm).
    *   Patients unfit for surgery.
*   **Methods:**
    *   **Skeletal Traction:** Through proximal tibia (if unstable) followed by cast bracing.
    *   **Cylinder Cast/Knee Brace:** For 4–6 weeks with non-weight bearing. Early quadriceps exercises are crucial.

**2. Operative Management**
*   **Indications:**
    *   Articular depression > 5–8 mm.
    *   Instability (> 10 degrees varus/valgus instability).
    *   Open fractures.
    *   Compartment syndrome.
    *   Associated vascular injury.

*   **Surgical Techniques:**
    *   **Percutaneous Cannulated Screws:** For simple splits (Type I).
    *   **ORIF with Buttress Plate:** Standard for Type II, IV.
        *   **Bone Grafting:** Essential in depressed fractures (Types II, III). The depressed articular fragment is elevated, and the void underneath is packed with bone graft (autograft or substitute) to prevent re-collapse,.
    *   **Dual Plating:** Often required for bicondylar fractures (Type V, VI) to support both medial and lateral columns.
    *   **External Fixation (Hybrid or Ilizarov):**
        *   Used for high-energy fractures (Type V, VI) with extensive soft tissue damage.
        *   Reduces risk of wound complications compared to extensive internal fixation in swollen limbs.

**Clinical Implication:** In severe fractures with soft tissue swelling, surgery is often staged. A temporary **spanning external fixator** is applied first to let swelling subside (1-2 weeks), followed by definitive internal fixation.

#### Complications
**Early:**
*   **[[Compartment Syndrome]]:** High risk in proximal tibial fractures. Present with pain out of proportion to injury, pain on passive stretch, and tight calf. Requires emergent [[fasciotomy]].
*   **Vascular Injury:** Damage to the [[popliteal artery]] (esp. in medial/posterior fracture-dislocations).
*   **Nerve Injury:** [[Common peroneal nerve]] injury leading to **foot drop**.
*   **Infection:** Higher risk in open fractures or after ORIF through compromised skin.

**Late:**
*   **Knee Stiffness:** Failure to regain full flexion is common. Early mobilization is key.
*   **Malunion:** Resulting in varus or valgus deformity.
*   **Post-traumatic [[Osteoarthritis]]:** Due to residual articular incongruity or mechanical axis deviation.
