# Keratoplasty (Corneal Transplantation)

**Keratoplasty** is the surgical replacement of a host's diseased [[cornea]] with a healthy donor cornea. It is an allografting procedure.

## Classification of Keratoplasty

Based on the depth of tissue replaced:
1.  **[[Penetrating Keratoplasty]] (PK):** Full-thickness replacement of the cornea.
2.  **[[Lamellar Keratoplasty]] (LK):** Partial-thickness replacement.
    *   **Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (ALK/DALK):** Replacement of anterior layers (epithelium and stroma), retaining the host endothelium.
    *   **Posterior/Endothelial Keratoplasty (EK):** Replacement of posterior layers (endothelium and Descemet's membrane).

## 1. Penetrating Keratoplasty (PK)

This is the traditional full-thickness grafting method.

### Indications
*   **Optical:** To improve vision (e.g., [[Corneal opacity]], [[Bullous keratopathy]], [[Corneal dystrophies]], advanced [[Keratoconus]]).
*   **Therapeutic:** To remove infected tissue not responding to medical therapy (e.g., non-healing [[Corneal ulcer]]).
*   **Tectonic:** To restore integrity of the eyeball (e.g., [[Corneal perforation]], [[Descemetocele]], severe thinning).
*   **Cosmetic:** To improve appearance in non-seeing eyes (e.g., unsightly [[Corneal scar]]).

### Surgical Technique
1.  **Excision of Donor Button:** Donor cornea is placed endothelial side up. A button is punched using a trephine.
    *   **Sizing:** Usually **0.25 mm larger** than the recipient bed to ensure water-tight closure and reduce glaucoma risk.
    *   **Exceptions:** In [[Aphakia]] or [[Keratoconus]], larger oversizing (0.5mm) may be preferred.
2.  **Excision of Host Tissue:** The diseased host cornea is trephined (usually 7.5–8.0 mm) and excised.
3.  **Suturing:** The donor button is secured using 10-0 nylon sutures (interrupted or continuous).

### Complications
*   **Early:** [[Wound leak]], shallow [[Anterior chamber]], [[Iris prolapse]], [[Secondary glaucoma]], persistent epithelial defects, infection ([[Endophthalmitis]]).
*   **Late:** [[Graft rejection]], recurrence of primary disease, high [[Astigmatism]], [[Cystoid macular edema]].

### Graft Rejection
It is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction.
*   **Epithelial Rejection:** Elevated epithelial rejection line.
*   **Subepithelial Rejection:** Subepithelial infiltrates (Krachmer’s spots/Kayes dots).
*   **Stromal Rejection:** Sudden full-thickness haze.
*   **Endothelial Rejection (Most common/severe):** Characterized by **[[Khodadoust line]]** (a linear row of precipitates on the endothelium demarcating healthy and rejected tissue).

## 2. Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (DALK)

### Principle
Replacement of the [[Corneal epithelium]] and [[Corneal stroma]] down to the [[Descemet's membrane]], leaving the host [[Endothelium]] intact.

### Indications
Diseases involving the stroma with a healthy endothelium:
*   [[Keratoconus]].
*   Stromal [[Corneal dystrophies]].
*   Stromal scarring/opacities not involving Descemet's membrane.

### Advantages over PK
*   **No risk of Endothelial Rejection** (as host endothelium is retained).
*   preservation of globe integrity (closed system surgery).

## 3. Endothelial Keratoplasty (EK)

Replacing the diseased endothelium with donor endothelium.

### Types of EK
1.  **[[DSEK]] (Descemet's Stripping Endothelial Keratoplasty) / [[DSAEK]] (Automated):**
    *   Replacement of Endothelium + Descemet's membrane + a thin slice of posterior stroma.
    *   DSAEK uses an automated microkeratome to harvest the donor tissue, making it more precise.
2.  **[[DMEK]] (Descemet's Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty):**
    *   Replacement of **only** the Endothelium + Descemet's membrane (no stroma).
    *   Anatomically exact replacement.

### Indications
*   [[Fuchs endothelial dystrophy]].
*   [[Pseudophakic bullous keratopathy]] (PBK).
*   [[Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy]].
*   Failed corneal graft.

### Advantages over PK
*   **Structural Integrity:** Minimal sutures (or sutureless), smaller incision.
*   **Refractive Outcome:** Minimal induced [[Astigmatism]] compared to PK.
*   **Visual Recovery:** Faster visual rehabilitation.

### Disadvantages
*   Higher risk of graft detachment/dislocation.
*   Endothelial cell loss is generally higher than PK (20-25%).

## Comparison of Procedures

| Feature | [[Penetrating Keratoplasty]] (PK) | [[DALK]] | [[DSAEK]] / [[DMEK]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tissue Replaced** | Full thickness (All layers) | Epithelium + Stroma | Endothelium + DM (+/- Stroma) |
| **Primary Indication** | Full thickness scars, Optical | Keratoconus, Stromal scars | Fuchs Dystrophy, Bullous Keratopathy |
| **Endothelial Rejection Risk** | High | **None** | Present |
| **Visual Recovery** | Slow (months) | Slow (months) | Rapid (weeks) |
| **Sutures** | Many (high astigmatism) | Many | Minimal/None (low astigmatism) |
| **"Open Sky" Surgery** | Yes (Higher risk) | No | No |

## Eye Banking and Preservation

**[[Eye donation]]** should occur within **6 hours** of death (up to 12 hours in cold climates).

### Preservation Methods
| Duration | Medium/Method | Storage Temp |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Short Term** (<48 hours) | Moist Chamber | 4°C |
| **Intermediate** (<2 weeks) | **MK Medium** (McCarey-Kaufman), Optisol, Chondroitin sulphate | 4°C |
| **Long Term** (>30 days) | Organ Culture, Cryopreservation | 31°C / -70°C |

**Contraindications for Donation:**
*   Death from unknown cause.
*   Systemic infections: [[HIV]], [[Hepatitis B]], [[Rabies]], [[Septicemia]].
*   Leukemia/Disseminated lymphoma.

> **Clinical Implication:**
> In **[[Keratoconus]]**, DALK is preferred over PK because the endothelium is healthy. In **[[Fuchs endothelial dystrophy]]**, DSEK/DMEK is preferred because the stroma is structurally normal, and only the pump function (endothelium) needs replacement.
