# Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL)

**Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL)** is a type of [[Sensorineural Hearing Loss]] caused by exposure to loud sounds. It is the second most common cause of acquired sensorineural hearing loss after [[Presbycusis]]. It is entirely preventable but irreversible once permanent damage occurs.

### Classification of Noise Trauma

Damage to the ear by noise can be classified into two distinct types based on the intensity and duration of exposure:

| Feature | Acoustic Trauma | Noise-Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nature of Exposure** | Single, brief exposure to very intense sound (Impulse noise). | Chronic, repeated exposure to less intense loud sounds over a long period. |
| **Intensity** | > 140 dB (e.g., bomb blast, gunshot). | > 85–90 dB (e.g., factory noise, loud music). |
| **Pathology** | Mechanical damage: Disruption of [[Organ of Corti]], rupture of [[Reissner’s Membrane]], ossicular disruption, or [[Tympanic Membrane]] perforation. | Metabolic damage: Oxidative stress, exhaustion of enzymes, and degeneration of hair cells. |
| **Onset** | Sudden | Insidious and progressive |

### Pathophysiology

The primary site of lesion in NIHL is the **[[Cochlea]]**, specifically the [[Organ of Corti]].

1.  **Hair Cell Damage:**
    *   **Outer Hair Cells (OHC):** These are more sensitive and are affected *first*. They show degenerative changes starting in the basal turn of the cochlea.
    *   **Inner Hair Cells (IHC):** Affected later as the exposure continues.
2.  **Mechanism:**
    *   **Metabolic Exhaustion:** Overstimulation leads to depletion of metabolic enzymes and oxygen tension.
    *   **Mechanical Destruction:** In acoustic trauma, there is direct physical destruction of stereocilia and support cells.
3.  **Frequency Specificity:**
    *   The damage typically begins at the **basal turn** of the cochlea.
    *   This corresponds to the **4000 Hz (4 kHz)** frequency range.
    *   **Why 4000 Hz?** The external auditory canal acts as a resonator, enhancing frequencies between 2000–3000 Hz. The maximum damage occurs half an octave to one octave above this resonant frequency (at 4–6 kHz).

### Threshold Shifts

Exposure to noise results in two types of hearing threshold shifts:

1.  **Temporary Threshold Shift (TTS):**
    *   Also known as **Auditory Fatigue**.
    *   Hearing impairment occurs immediately after noise exposure (e.g., after a rock concert or factory shift).
    *   **Recovery:** Hearing recovers within minutes, hours, or up to 2 weeks (usually 24 hours) once the subject is removed from the noise source.
    *   *Pathology:* Biochemical fatigue or mild edema of hair cells.

2.  **Permanent Threshold Shift (PTS):**
    *   Result of continuous or repeated exposure without adequate recovery time.
    *   **Irreversible:** Caused by apoptosis and permanent destruction of [[Hair Cells]].

### Clinical Features

*   **Onset:** Gradual and insidious (except in acoustic trauma).
*   **Laterality:** Usually **bilateral and symmetrical**. (Asymmetric loss may be seen in rifle shooters; a right-handed shooter often has more loss in the *left* ear due to the "head shadow effect").
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **[[Hearing Loss]]:** Difficulty hearing in noisy surroundings (cocktail party effect).
    *   **[[Tinnitus]]:** Often high-pitched, constant, or buzzing. May be the presenting symptom.
    *   **Diplacusis:** Double hearing (rare).
*   **Progression:** Deterioration stops if noise exposure ceases.

### Diagnosis and Investigations

#### 1. Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA)
This is the gold standard for diagnosis.
*   **Type of Loss:** [[Sensorineural Hearing Loss]] (SNHL).
*   **The Acoustic Dip (Boiler's Notch):**
    *   A characteristic **dip or notch at 4000 Hz (4 kHz)** is seen in both air conduction and bone conduction.
    *   **Recovery:** The hearing threshold often improves at higher frequencies (8000 Hz), creating a "V" or "U" shaped notch.
    *   **Progression:** With continued exposure, the notch deepens and widens to involve adjacent frequencies (3000 Hz, 6000 Hz) and eventually speech frequencies (500, 1000, 2000 Hz).

#### 2. High Frequency Audiometry
*   Tests frequencies between 8000 Hz and 20,000 Hz.
*   Useful for early detection before standard frequencies are affected.

#### 3. Otoacoustic Emissions (OAEs)
*   **Distortion Product OAEs (DPOAEs):** These are absent or reduced early in the disease process because OHCs are the first to be damaged.
*   Can detect damage *before* it appears on the Pure Tone Audiogram.

#### 4. SISI and Recruitment
*   **Short Increment Sensitivity Index (SISI):** High score (70–100%) indicating cochlear pathology.
*   **Recruitment:** Positive (abnormal growth of loudness).

### Permissible Noise Limits

The risk of damage depends on the intensity (dB) and duration of exposure.
*   **Safe Limit:** **85 dB for 8 hours** per day for 5 days a week.
*   **The 3 dB Rule (Halving Rule):** For every 3 dB increase in intensity, the permissible exposure time is **halved**. (Note: Some older industrial standards use a 5 dB rule, but 3 dB is the modern audiological standard).

| Noise Level (dB A) | Permissible Daily Exposure |
| :--- | :--- |
| **85 dB** | **8 hours** |
| 88 dB | 4 hours |
| 91 dB | 2 hours |
| 94 dB | 1 hour |
| 100 dB | 15 minutes |
| **> 140 dB** | **No exposure permitted (Impact noise)** |

### Management and Prevention

Since NIHL is irreversible, **prevention** is the primary goal.

#### 1. Hearing Conservation Programs
*   **Noise Reduction:** Engineering controls to reduce noise at the source (lubrication, mufflers, changing machinery).
*   **Administrative Controls:** Rotating worker shifts to reduce exposure time.

#### 2. Personal Protective Devices (Ear Protectors)
*   **Ear Plugs:** Inserted into the canal. Provide attenuation of **15–30 dB**.
*   **Ear Muffs:** Cover the pinna. Provide attenuation of **30–40 dB**.
*   **Combined:** Plugs + Muffs provide maximum protection (>40 dB).

#### 3. Monitoring
*   Pre-employment audiometry (baseline).
*   Regular follow-up audiometry (annual) to detect Temporary Threshold Shift.

#### 4. Rehabilitation
*   **[[Hearing Aids]]:** For patients with significant permanent hearing loss.
*   **Lip Reading/Auditory Training.**

### Differential Diagnosis of 4 kHz Dip

While 4 kHz dip is classic for NIHL, it may rarely be seen in:
*   Hereditary deafness.
*   Head injury.
*   Acoustic neuroma (rarely).
*   Viral labyrinthitis.
