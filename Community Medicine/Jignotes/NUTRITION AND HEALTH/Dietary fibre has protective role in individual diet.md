# [[NUTRITION AND HEALTH]] > Dietary fibre has protective role in individual diet

### Definition
[[Dietary fibre]], also known as non-starch polysaccharides (NSP), constitutes the remnants of the edible part of plants that are resistant to digestion and absorption in the human small intestine. It undergoes complete or partial fermentation in the large intestine. Physiologically, it includes polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, lignin, and associated plant substances.

### Classification of Dietary Fibre
Fibre is broadly classified based on its solubility in water, which determines its physiological function.

| Type | Components | Key Sources | Primary Physiological Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Insoluble Fibre** | Cellulose, Hemicellulose, Lignin | Whole grains (wheat bran), skin of fruits, vegetables | • Increases stool bulk<br>• Softens stool<br>• Speeds up intestinal transit |
| **Soluble Fibre** | Pectins, Gums, Mucilages | Oats, legumes (peas, lentils), fruits (apples, citrus), vegetables | • Forms a gel<br>• Absorbs cholesterol<br>• Delays gastric emptying<br>• Attenuates blood glucose |

### Protective Roles in Individual Diet
A daily intake of approximately **40 grams** of dietary fibre is considered desirable for health benefits.

#### 1. Gastrointestinal Health
*   **Prevention of [[Constipation]]:** Fibre increases the water-holding capacity of colonic contents and adds bulk to the feces. This softens the stool and stimulates the defecation reflex (rectal distension).
*   **Diverticular Disease:** By reducing the hardness of stool, fibre reduces the need for straining. This lowers intra-abdominal and intracolonic pressures, preventing the formation of diverticula (herniations) and **[[diverticulosis]]**.
*   **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS):** Fibre is used in the management of IBS to regulate bowel movements.

#### 2. Cancer Prevention
*   **[[Colorectal Cancer]]:** There is a direct inverse relationship between fibre intake and colon cancer.
    *   **Mechanism:** High fibre intake increases fecal volume and reduces **transit time**. This dilutes the concentration of carcinogens and reduces the time the bowel mucosa is exposed to them. It also inhibits fecal mutagen synthesis.
*   **Other Cancers:** Fibre intake is associated with a reduced incidence of stomach, breast, and prostate cancers.

#### 3. Cardiovascular Health
*   **Cholesterol Reduction:** Soluble fibres (like gums and pectins) bind to bile salts in the intestine, preventing their reabsorption. This forces the liver to use circulating cholesterol to produce more bile acids, thereby lowering serum total and **[[LDL cholesterol]]** levels.
*   **Prevention of [[Coronary Heart Disease]] (CHD):** An inverse association exists between fibre intake and CHD risk due to its lipid-lowering and anti-atherosclerotic effects.

#### 4. Metabolic Health ([[Diabetes Mellitus]])
*   **Glycemic Control:** Soluble fibre delays gastric emptying and slows the absorption of glucose. This reduces post-prandial blood glucose spikes and insulin levels.
*   **Insulin Sensitivity:** It flattens the glucose tolerance curve and may reduce the work demand on pancreatic beta-cells.

#### 5. Weight Management ([[Obesity]])
*   **Satiety:** Fibre-rich foods (complex carbohydrates) provide bulk and promote a feeling of fullness (satiety), which helps reduce total energy intake and aids in weight control.

### Clinical Relevance: Adverse Effects of Excess
While beneficial, excessive intake (e.g., >60g/day) without adequate fluid can lead to issues:
*   **Nutrient Malabsorption:** Excess fibre may bind to micronutrients like **Zinc**, **Calcium**, **Iron**, and **Magnesium**, reducing their bioavailability.
*   **Bowel Irritation:** Can cause flatulence and abdominal discomfort due to fermentation.

### Mnemonic
To remember the benefits of **FIBRE**:
*   **F**orms Bulk (Prevents Constipation)
*   **I**nhibits Carcinogens (Prevents Colon Cancer)
*   **B**inds Bile Salts (Lowers Cholesterol)
*   **R**egulates Glucose (Controls Diabetes)
*   **E**arly Satiety (Prevents Obesity)
