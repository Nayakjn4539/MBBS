# Urban Malaria

### 1. Introduction
Urban malaria is a distinct epidemiological entity driven by rapid and unplanned urbanization, industrialization, and migration. Unlike rural malaria, which is often seasonal and linked to natural breeding sites, urban malaria is perennial and largely "man-made" due to artificial water collections.

It accounts for approximately **7-8% of total malaria cases** and **11% of malaria-related deaths** in India.

### 2. Epidemiological Determinants

| Factor | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Vector** | **[[Anopheles stephensi]]** is the primary vector. It is highly adaptable to human dwellings. *A. culicifacies* may be found in peri-urban areas. |
| **Parasite** | Both *[[Plasmodium vivax]]* and *[[Plasmodium falciparum]]* circulate. Migrant laborers often introduce new strains. |
| **Host** | Affects all ages. High risk in slum dwellers and construction workers due to exposure and poor housing. |

### 3. Breeding Sites (The "Man-Made" Problem)
The vector *A. stephensi* breeds chiefly in **artificial containers** rather than natural water bodies. Common sites include:
*   **Domestic:** [[Overhead tanks]], underground storage tanks, cisterns, water coolers, flower vases.
*   **Peri-domestic:** Roof gutters, bottles, old tyres, discarded tins.
*   **Community/Industrial:** [[Construction sites]] (curing tanks), unused wells, ornamental ponds.

**Clinical Relevance:**
Patients presenting with fever and chills in urban settings, particularly those living near construction sites or areas with irregular water supply (leading to storage practices), must be evaluated for malaria using **Peripheral Blood Smear** or **Rapid Diagnostic Kits (RDT)**.

### 4. Urban Malaria Scheme (UMS)
The **[[Urban Malaria Scheme]]** was sanctioned in **1971** to tackle this specific challenge.

**Objectives:**
1.  To prevent deaths due to malaria.
2.  To reduce transmission and morbidity.

**Criteria for Inclusion:**
*   Towns/Cities with population > 50,000.
*   [[Slide Positivity Rate]] (SPR) of 5% and above.

### 5. Control Strategies
Unlike rural malaria control which often relies on Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS), urban control focuses heavily on **Recurrent Anti-Larval Measures** and legislation.

#### A. Vector Control (Primary Strategy)
1.  **Source Reduction (Environmental Management):**
    *   **Mechanical:** Covering [[Overhead tanks]] and cisterns with lids.
    *   **Drainage:** Filling up ditches, cesspools, and ensuring proper drainage.
    *   **Dry Day:** Observing a weekly dry day (emptying water coolers/containers).
    *   **Construction:** Preventing water stagnation at building sites.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Use of **[[Larvivorous fish]]** like *Gambusia affinis* and *Poecilia reticulata* (Guppy) in ornamental tanks and slow-moving streams.

3.  **Chemical Control (Larvicides):**
    *   Used where water cannot be drained or fish cannot be used.
    *   **Chemicals:** [[Temephos]] (Abate), Fenthion, or Malarial oil.
    *   **Biolarvicides:** *Bacillus thuringiensis*.

4.  **Anti-Adult Measures:**
    *   **Space Spraying:** Fogging with **[[Pyrethrum]]** extract is done in the peripheral belt of towns (1/2 to 1 mile) or during outbreaks to knock down adult mosquitoes.
    *   *Note:* Indoor Residual Spray (IRS) is generally **not** recommended in urban areas due to operational difficulties and refusal by residents.

#### B. Legislative Measures
*   Enactment and implementation of **[[Civic bye-laws]]** and Building bye-laws.
*   Penalties for homeowners or contractors who allow mosquito breeding conditions (e.g., uncovered tanks, water logging at construction sites).

#### C. Case Management
*   Early diagnosis through **Passive Surveillance** (Malaria clinics, urban dispensaries, hospitals).
*   Radical treatment to eliminate the parasite reservoir.

### Mnemonic for Urban Malaria Breeding Sites
**"CITY PESTS"**

*   **C**onstruction sites
*   **I**nside coolers (Air coolers)
*   **T**yres (Old/discarded)
*   **Y**ards (Junk/Scrap yards)
*   **P**ots (Flower vases/Ornamental)
*   **E**mpty tins/bottles
*   **S**torage tanks (Overhead/Underground)
*   **T**errace gutters (Blocked)
*   **S**tephensi (*Anopheles stephensi* vector)
