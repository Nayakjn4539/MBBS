# Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)

[[Diabetic Macular Edema]] (DME) is a specific manifestation of [[diabetic retinopathy]] characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the **outer plexiform layer (Henle’s layer)** and the **inner nuclear layer** of the retina, centered around the foveola. It is the most common cause of visual impairment in patients with [[diabetes mellitus]], particularly in [[Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy]] (NPDR).

### Pathogenesis
The primary mechanism involves the breakdown of the **inner blood-retinal barrier** due to microangiopathy caused by chronic hyperglycemia.
*   **Capillary Leakage:** Loss of pericytes and endothelial damage leads to increased permeability of retinal capillaries.
*   **Fluid Accumulation:** Plasma constituents (proteins, lipids, fluid) leak into the retinal layers.
*   **Cyst Formation:** Fluid accumulates in the outer plexiform layer (Henle's layer), eventually forming cystoid spaces.

### Risk Factors
*   **Duration of Diabetes:** The most important risk factor.
*   **Metabolic Control:** Poor control (High HbA1c).
*   **Systemic Hypertension.**
*   **Dyslipidemia** (High cholesterol/lipids).
*   **Renal Disease** (Diabetic nephropathy).
*   **Pregnancy.**
*   **Anemia.**

### Classification

#### 1. Clinically Significant Macular Edema (CSME)
Defined by the **ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study)** criteria. Treatment is indicated if *any one* of the following is present on slit-lamp biomicroscopy (using 78D/90D lens):

| Criteria | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Retinal Thickening** | Thickening of the retina at or within **500 microns** of the center of the [[macula]]. |
| **Hard Exudates** | [[Hard exudates]] at or within **500 microns** of the center of the macula, *if associated with adjacent retinal thickening*. |
| **Zone of Thickening** | A zone of retinal thickening **1 disc area (1500 microns)** or larger, if at least part of it is within **1 disc diameter** of the foveal center. |

#### 2. Morphological/Angiographic Classification
Based on [[Fundus Fluorescein Angiography]] (FFA) findings:
*   **Focal Exudative Maculopathy:** Characterized by focal leakage from [[microaneurysms]] with adequate perfusion. Often associated with circinate rings of hard exudates.
*   **Diffuse Exudative Maculopathy:** Diffuse leakage and retinal thickening throughout the posterior pole.
*   **Ischemic Maculopathy:** Characterized by marked visual loss with enlargement of the **Foveal Avascular Zone (FAZ)** and capillary dropouts. *Laser photocoagulation is contraindicated here.*
*   **Mixed Maculopathy:** Features of both exudative and ischemic types.

#### 3. OCT-Based Classification
Based on [[Optical Coherence Tomography]] findings:
*   **Non-tractional DME:**
    *   Spongy retinal thickening.
    *   Cystoid Macular Edema (CME).
    *   Neurosensory detachment.
*   **Tractional DME:**
    *   Vitreofoveal traction (VFT).
    *   Taut/thickened [[posterior hyaloid membrane]].

### Clinical Features

**Symptoms:**
*   **Painless** loss of central vision (minimal to moderate initially).
*   **Metamorphopsia** (distortion of images).
*   **Micropsia** (objects appear smaller).
*   **Positive Scotoma** (shadowed areas in central vision).

**Signs (Ophthalmoscopy/Biomicroscopy):**
*   **Loss of foveal reflex/contour**.
*   **Retinal Thickening:** Best appreciated with stereoscopic examination (slit lamp + 90D lens).
*   **Hard Exudates:** Yellowish, waxy lesions often arranged in a **circinate pattern** (ring) around leaking microaneurysms.
*   **Honeycomb Appearance:** Seen in established cases due to multiple cystoid oval spaces.

### Investigations

1.  **Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT):** **Gold Standard** for quantifying retinal thickness and monitoring treatment response.
    *   *Findings:* Loss of foveal depression, intraretinal cystic spaces (low reflectivity), subretinal fluid, and vitreomacular traction.
    *   > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> OCT showing cystoid spaces in the retina with loss of foveal depression

2.  **Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA):** Used to identify leaking sources and ischemic areas.
    *   *Focal DME:* Focal leak spots.
    *   *Diffuse DME:* Diffuse leakage.
    *   *Cystoid Macular Edema (CME):* Classic **Flower-Petal Appearance** in late phases due to dye accumulation in the outer plexiform layer.
    *   *Ischemic Maculopathy:* Enlarged and irregular Foveal Avascular Zone (FAZ).

### Management

**Clinical Implication:** Before starting ocular treatment, strictly control systemic factors (Blood sugar, BP, Lipids, Renal status).

#### 1. Pharmacotherapy (Intravitreal Injections)
Currently the first-line treatment for center-involving DME.

*   **Anti-VEGF Agents:** Neutralize [[Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor]], reducing leakage.
    *   Drugs: **Ranibizumab** (Lucentis), **Bevacizumab** (Avastin), **Aflibercept** (Eylea), **Brolucizumab**.
    *   *Regimen:* Monthly dosing initially, then PRN (Pro Re Nata) or Treat-and-Extend.

*   **Intravitreal Steroids:** Used for pseudophakic patients, chronic cases, or anti-VEGF non-responders.
    *   **Triamcinolone Acetonide** (IVTA).
    *   **Dexamethasone Implant** (Ozurdex).
    *   **Fluocinolone Acetonide Implant** (Iluvien).
    *   *Side Effects:* Secondary [[Cataract]], [[Glaucoma]] (steroid-induced IOP rise).

#### 2. Laser Photocoagulation
Previously the gold standard, now mostly used for non-center involving DME or as adjunctive therapy.
*   **Focal Laser:** Direct burns applied to leaking microaneurysms (50-100 $\mu$m spot size) in the center of hard exudate rings.
*   **Grid Laser:** Grid pattern burns applied for diffuse edema (avoiding the FAZ).
*   **Contraindication:** Do **NOT** perform laser in **Ischemic Maculopathy** as it worsens ischemia.

#### 3. Surgical Management (Pars Plana Vitrectomy)
*   **Indications:** Tractional DME (vitreomacular traction), taut posterior hyaloid membrane, or non-resolving DME despite medical therapy.
*   **Procedure:** [[Pars Plana Vitrectomy]] (PPV) with removal of the posterior hyaloid and sometimes peeling of the Internal Limiting Membrane (ILM).

### Summary of Treatment Hierarchy
1.  **Systemic Control:** Sugar, BP, Lipids.
2.  **Center-involving DME:** Intravitreal Anti-VEGF (1st choice) $\rightarrow$ Steroids (2nd choice).
3.  **Non-Center involving DME:** Focal/Grid Laser.
4.  **Tractional DME:** Vitrectomy.
