# [[Upper Limb]] > Radial Head Fracture

### [[Radial Head Fracture]]

**General Information**
Fractures of the [[radial head]] are common injuries involving the [[elbow]], occurring primarily in adults (unlike [[radial neck fractures]] which are common in children). The [[radial head]] is a critical secondary stabilizer of the [[elbow joint]] against valgus stress and plays a vital role in force transmission across the [[wrist]] and [[elbow]].

#### Mechanism of Injury
*   **Indirect Trauma (Most Common):** A fall on an outstretched hand ([[FOOSH]]) with the [[elbow]] in extension and the [[forearm]] pronated. The force is transmitted axially, driving the [[radial head]] against the [[capitellum]] of the [[humerus]].
*   **Valgus Force:** Often associated, which may lead to concurrent injury of the [[medial collateral ligament]].
*   **Direct Trauma:** A direct blow to the lateral aspect of the [[elbow]] (less common).

#### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:** Pain on the lateral aspect of the [[elbow]], worse with movement.
*   **Swelling:** Lateral elbow swelling due to [[hemarthrosis]].
*   **Tenderness:** Localized tenderness over the [[radial head]] (best palpated in the "soft spot" or while rotating the [[forearm]]).
*   **Range of Motion:** Painful restriction of movements, particularly **supination and pronation**. Flexion and extension may also be limited due to pain and effusion.

> **Clinical Implication:** If a patient has a [[radial head fracture]] but significant [[wrist pain]], suspect an associated [[distal radioulnar joint]] (DRUJ) injury (Essex-Lopresti lesion).

#### Classification
The **Mason Classification** (modified by Johnston) is the standard system used for assessment and treatment planning.

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Type I** | Undisplaced fracture or minimally displaced (< 2mm). No mechanical block to rotation. |
| **Type II** | Displaced fracture (> 2mm) involving a single large fragment (marginal sector fracture). May cause mechanical block. |
| **Type III** | Comminuted fracture involving the entire [[radial head]]. |
| **Type IV** | [[Radial head fracture]] associated with [[elbow dislocation]]. |

#### Imaging
*   **X-rays:** Anteroposterior (AP) and Lateral views of the [[elbow]].
    *   **Vertical split** or depression in the articular surface.
    *   **Double arc sign:** Seen in Type IV injuries.
*   **Occult Fractures:** In undisplaced fractures, the fracture line may not be visible. Look for the **[[Fat Pad Sign]]** (Sail Sign):
    *   Elevation of the anterior fat pad (resembling a sail) or visualization of the posterior fat pad (which is normally hidden in the olecranon fossa) indicates joint [[effusion]]/[[hemarthrosis]].

#### Treatment
The management depends on the Mason type and the presence of associated ligamentous injuries.

**1. Conservative Management**
*   **Indication:** **Mason Type I** (Undisplaced) and stable Type II fractures without a mechanical block.
*   **Protocol:**
    *   Aspiration of [[hematoma]] to relieve pain (optional).
    *   Immobilization in a **collar and cuff sling** or a removable splint for comfort (maximum 1 week).
    *   **Early Mobilization:** Active flexion-extension and pronation-supination exercises are started as soon as pain permits (usually within 24-48 hours) to prevent stiffness.

**2. Surgical Management**
*   **Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF):**
    *   **Indication:** **Mason Type II** with mechanical block, or large fragments (>1/3rd of articular surface).
    *   **Implants:** Mini-screws (Herbert screws) or low-profile plates. Ideally placed in the "safe zone" of the [[radial head]] to avoid impingement during rotation.
*   **Excision of Radial Head:**
    *   **Indication:** Severe **Mason Type III** (comminuted) where reconstruction is not possible, provided the [[medial collateral ligament]] and [[interosseous membrane]] are intact.
    *   **Contraindication:** Do not excise if there is valgus instability or longitudinal instability ([[Essex-Lopresti injury]]), as proximal migration of the radius will occur.
*   **Radial Head Replacement (Arthroplasty):**
    *   **Indication:** Comminuted fractures (Type III/IV) associated with ligamentous instability (MCL injury) or [[Essex-Lopresti lesion]].
    *   **Prosthesis:** Metallic modular prosthesis is preferred over silicone (which can cause synovitis).

> **Clinical Implication:** In elderly patients with low functional demand, excision of a comminuted [[radial head]] yields good results. In young, active patients, preservation (ORIF) or Replacement is preferred to maintain elbow stability.

#### Associated Injuries
**1. [[Essex-Lopresti Fracture]]-Dislocation**
*   **Definition:** Comminuted fracture of the [[radial head]] combined with disruption of the [[interosseous membrane]] and dislocation of the [[distal radioulnar joint]] (DRUJ).
*   **Mechanism:** Severe axial loading.
*   **Management:**
    *   Fixation or replacement of the [[radial head]] (Excision is contraindicated).
    *   Stabilization of the DRUJ (pinning).

**2. [[Terrible Triad of Elbow]]**
*   Combination of:
    1.  [[Radial head fracture]]
    2.  [[Coronoid process fracture]]
    3.  [[Posterior elbow dislocation]]
*   This is a highly unstable injury requiring surgical stabilization of all components.

#### Complications
**Early**
*   **[[Posterior Interosseous Nerve]] (PIN) Palsy:** Can occur due to the injury itself or iatrogenic damage during surgery (drilling or retraction).
*   **[[Compartment Syndrome]]:** Rare in isolated injuries but possible with severe swelling.

**Late**
*   **Stiffness:** The most common complication. Loss of extension (10-15 degrees) is frequent but usually functionally acceptable. Loss of pronation/supination is more disabling.
*   **[[Myositis Ossificans]]:** Heterotopic ossification in the [[brachialis]] muscle or capsule, leading to restricted motion. Massage should be avoided.
*   **[[Post-traumatic Arthritis]]:** Secondary [[osteoarthritis]] of the radio-capitellar joint.
*   **Proximal Radial Migration:** Occurs following excision of the radial head if the interosseous membrane is incompetent, leading to wrist pain.
*   **[[Avascular Necrosis]]:** Of the radial head fragments.
