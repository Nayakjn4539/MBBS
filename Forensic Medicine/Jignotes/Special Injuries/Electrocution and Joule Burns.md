# [[Special Injuries]] > Electrocution and Joule Burns

### **Electrocution and Joule Burns**

**Electrocution** refers to death caused by the passage of electric current through the body. **Electric shock** refers to non-fatal injuries caused by electricity. The severity of the injury depends on the **Amperage** (amount of current), **Voltage** (force), **Resistance** (of the body), **Path** of the current, and **Duration** of contact.

### **Mechanism of Injury**

The damage is caused by three primary mechanisms:
1.  **Direct effect:** Depolarization of nerves and muscles leading to [[Ventricular Fibrillation]] or respiratory arrest.
2.  **Thermal effect:** Conversion of electrical energy into heat (Joule heating), causing burns and tissue necrosis.
3.  **Mechanical effect:** Violent muscle contractions leading to fractures or dislocations.

> **Note:** Alternating Current (AC) is 4–5 times more dangerous than Direct Current (DC) because AC causes a continuous tetanic spasm (**"Hold-on" phenomenon**), preventing the victim from releasing the source.

### **Joule Burn (Electric Mark / Current Mark)**

A [[Joule Burn]] is the specific **entry wound** caused by the passage of electric current from the conductor into the body. It is a collapse of skin structure due to heat generated by the skin's resistance.

#### **Gross Appearance**
*   **Shape:** Usually round, oval, or follows the shape of the conductor (patterned injury).
*   **Center:** Depressed, crater-like, pale, greyish-white, or charred.
*   **Margins:** Raised/elevated ridge, often indurated (hard).
*   **Surroundings:** A zone of hyperemia (redness) may be present in living victims.
*   **Texture:** Dry, parchment-like, and leathery. Unlike thermal burns, there is usually **no blister** formation (unless current continues for a long time).
*   **Sensation:** Often painless due to destruction of sensory nerve endings.
*   **Crocodile Skin:** In high-voltage burns, multiple spark lesions may fuse to create a wrinkled appearance resembling crocodile skin.

#### **Microscopic Appearance (Diagnostic Features)**
1.  **Streaming of Nuclei:** The nuclei of the basal cells of the epidermis become elongated and arrange themselves parallel to each other (Nuclear streaming/Palisading).
2.  **Honeycomb Appearance:** Intra-epidermal split or vacuoles formation.
3.  **Metallization:** Deposition of metal particles from the conductor into the tissues.
    *   **Acid Orcein Stain:** Used to demonstrate elastin changes.
    *   **Alizarin Red S:** Used to detect calcium deposition.

### **Other Types of Electrical Burns**

| Type of Burn | Mechanism | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Flash / Spark Burn** | No direct contact. Current "jumps" an air gap (arc) between conductor and skin. | **"Kissing burn"**. Pinpoint, scattered lesions. Resembles a gunshot wound residue. Singed hair. |
| **Filigree Burn** | Caused by [[Lightning]]. | **Lichtenberg flowers**. Arborescent, fern-like, feathery pattern on skin. Pathognomonic of lightning strike. Disappears in 1-2 days. |
| **Exogenous Burn** | External heat generated by the conductor. | Looks like a standard thermal burn. Clothing may catch fire. |

### **Pathophysiology of Death**

The cause of death depends on the voltage and path of the current:

*   **Low Voltage (< 1000 Volts):** Death is usually due to **[[Ventricular Fibrillation]]**. The heart muscle fibers contract chaotically.
*   **High Voltage (> 1000 Volts):** Death is usually due to **Respiratory Center Paralysis** (Brainstem inhibition) or direct paralysis of respiratory muscles (Asphyxia).

### **Clinical Features (Survivors)**
*   **CNS:** Coma, amnesia, hemiplegia, paraplegia.
*   **CVS:** Arrhythmias, angina, infarction.
*   **Musculoskeletal:** Fractures of long bones or spine (due to violent tetanic contractions), dislocations (commonly shoulder).
*   **Renal:** [[Myoglobinuria]] leading to Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN) due to massive muscle damage ([[Rhabdomyolysis]]).

### **Autopsy Findings**

#### **External Findings**
1.  **Entry Mark (Joule Burn):** Look for the characteristic crater-like lesion described above.
2.  **Exit Mark:** Usually seen on the feet (earth point). Appears as a split or blowout of the skin due to explosive exit of current.
3.  **Current Pearls:** Small globules of molten metal from the conductor found on the skin surface.
4.  **Rigor Mortis:** Appears early and passes off early due to violent muscle contractions depleting ATP.
5.  **Postmortem Lividity:** Well developed; dark red/blue (indicative of asphyxia/anoxia).
6.  **Face:** Pale (in ventricular fibrillation) or Congested/Cyanosed (in respiratory arrest).

#### **Internal Findings**
1.  **Lungs:** Congested and edematous.
2.  **Heart:** Petechial hemorrhages (Tardieu spots) under the pericardium/endocardium. Focal myocardial necrosis may be present.
3.  **Muscles:** **[[Zenker's Degeneration]]** (waxy degeneration) of muscles. The muscles appear pale and cooked.
4.  **Bones:** **Bone Pearls** (Wax drippings) – Heat melts calcium phosphate in the bone, which resolidifies as pearl-like distinct radio-opaque densities on X-ray.
5.  **Brain:** Congestion, petechial hemorrhages.

### **Medicolegal Aspects**

1.  **Accidental:** Most common manner of death (domestic appliances, occupational hazards, line workers).
2.  **Suicidal:** Rare. Individuals may wrap wires around wrists or body.
3.  **Homicidal:** Extremely rare. Examples include throwing an energized heater into a bathtub (famous case: *Brides in the Bath*).
4.  **Judicial Electrocution:** Method of execution in some countries (Electric Chair).
5.  **Iatrogenic:** Faulty medical equipment (cautery, defibrillators).

**Investigation Tips:**
*   Always look for the **"break in the circuit"** (e.g., faulty switch, frayed wire).
*   Check footwear (insulation).
*   Presence of water/moisture lowers resistance drastically (Dry skin resistance: ~100,000 Ohms; Wet skin: ~1000 Ohms).

### **Mnemonics**

*   **Factors affecting injury:** **VA R D**
    *   **V**oltage
    *   **A**mperage
    *   **R**esistance
    *   **D**uration

*   **Microscopic Finding:** **P**alisading of **N**uclei = **P**ositive **N**egative (Electricity).
