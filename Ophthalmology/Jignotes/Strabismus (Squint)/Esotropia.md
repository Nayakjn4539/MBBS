# Esotropia (Convergent Strabismus)

[[Esotropia]], or convergent [[strabismus]], denotes the inward deviation of one eye while the other fixes on an object. It is the most common type of squint in children.

## Classification
Esotropia is broadly classified based on etiology and age of onset into:
1.  **Infantile Esotropia** (previously called Congenital Esotropia).
2.  **Accommodative Esotropia** (Refractive, Non-refractive, Mixed).
3.  **Non-accommodative Esotropia** (acquired).
4.  **Secondary Esotropia** (due to sensory deprivation or consecutive to surgery).

## 1. Infantile Esotropia (Essential Infantile Esotropia)

This is a specific entity of [[comitant strabismus]] appearing within the first 6 months of life.

### Clinical Features
*   **Onset:** Usually appears between **2–4 months** of age; almost always before 6 months.
*   **Angle of Deviation:** The deviation is usually **constant** and **large** (>30 Prism Diopters or >35°).
*   **Refractive Error:** Usually **normal for age** (mild hypermetropia of +1.0 to +2.0 D). High refractive error is absent.
*   **Fixation Pattern:**
    *   **Cross-fixation** is common: The child uses the left eye to look to the right and the right eye to look to the left.
    *   In primary gaze, fixation is usually alternating.
    *   If the child consistently prefers one eye for fixation, it indicates **[[Amblyopia]]** in the deviating eye.
*   **Neurology:** No underlying neurological deficit.

### Associated Ocular Findings
These features typically develop later (after 1–3 years):
1.  **[[Dissociated Vertical Deviation]] (DVD):** Seen in 70–90% of cases by age 3. One eye drifts upward when covered or spontaneously.
2.  **[[Inferior Oblique Overaction]] (IOOA):** Usually develops after 1 year of age.
3.  **[[Latent Nystagmus]]:** Horizontal nystagmus that appears only when one eye is covered.

### Differential Diagnosis
*   **[[Pseudoesotropia]]:** Apparent squint due to a flat nasal bridge, broad [[epicanthal folds]], or negative [[Angle Kappa]].
    *   **Hirschberg test** reveals symmetrical corneal light reflexes in pseudoesotropia.
*   **[[Duane's Retraction Syndrome]] (Type 1):** Limitation of abduction with globe retraction.
*   **[[Sixth Nerve Palsy]]:** Limitation of abduction, incomitant deviation.
*   **[[Nystagmus Blockage Syndrome]]**.

### Management
The goal is to align eyes to facilitate the development of [[binocular single vision]].

1.  **Refraction:** Rule out high hypermetropia.
2.  **Treatment of [[Amblyopia]]:** **Occlusion therapy** (patching the normal eye) must be done *before* surgery to equalize vision.
3.  **Surgery (Treatment of Choice):**
    *   **Timing:** Ideally between **6 months to 2 years** of age (preferably before 1 year).
    *   **Procedure:** **[[Bimedial Rectus Recession]]** (weakening both medial recti) is preferred over unilateral recess-resect procedures.

> **Clinical Implication:** Surgery performed before 2 years of age offers a better chance for the development of some degree of binocular vision, though high-grade stereopsis is rarely achieved.

## 2. Accommodative Esotropia

This type occurs due to the overaction of convergence associated with the [[accommodation reflex]]. It is the most common type of squint in children presenting around **2–3 years of age**.

### Pathophysiology
It is driven by the relationship between **Accommodation** and **Accommodative Convergence** (AC).
*   **Uncorrected [[Hypermetropia]]:** The child accommodates excessively to clear the blurred image, triggering excessive convergence.
*   **High [[AC/A Ratio]]:** For every diopter of accommodation, there is an abnormally high amount of convergence.

### Classification & Clinical Features

| Type | Refractive Error | AC/A Ratio | Deviation Characteristics | Management |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Refractive** | High [[Hypermetropia]] (+4D to +7D) | Normal | Esotropia is **equal** for distance and near. | Full cycloplegic spectacle correction. |
| **Non-Refractive** | Normal for age (low hypermetropia) | **High** | Little/no deviation for distance; **Significant Esotropia for near** (>10 PD difference). | **Bifocal spectacles** (Executive type with +3.0D add). Miotics. |
| **Mixed** | High [[Hypermetropia]] | **High** | Deviation at distance (corrected by hypermetropic glasses) + Residual deviation at near. | Hypermetropic correction for distance + Bifocals for near. |

### Management Strategy

1.  **Refraction:** Perform **[[Cycloplegic Refraction]]** (using Atropine 1% ointment for 3 days) to reveal total hypermetropia.
2.  **Spectacles:**
    *   **Refractive type:** Prescribe the **full hypermetropic correction** revealed by cycloplegia. This usually straightens the eyes completely.
    *   **Non-refractive (High AC/A):** **Bifocals** with a high near add (+3.0D) to relax accommodation at near.
3.  **Pharmacological (Miotics):**
    *   Agents: **[[Ecothiophate]]** (Phospholine iodide) or **[[Pilocarpine]]**.
    *   Mechanism: Induces peripheral accommodation, reducing the central effort and thus reducing accommodative convergence.
    *   Indication: Used when glasses are not tolerated or for short-term therapy.
4.  **Surgery:**
    *   Indicated only for **Non-accommodative elements** (partially accommodative esotropia) where a residual deviation persists despite full optical correction.

## 3. Acquired Non-Accommodative Esotropia

These are esodeviations starting after 6 months of age that are *not* corrected by glasses.

*   **Essential Acquired:** Onset in childhood (after 6 months). Angle is usually moderate.
*   **[[Microtropia]]:** Small angle esotropia (<10 PD), usually with deep amblyopia and [[eccentric fixation]]. Often associated with [[anisometropia]].
*   **Basic Type:** Deviation equal at distance and near.
*   **Convergence Excess:** Deviation Near > Distance.
*   **Divergence Insufficiency:** Deviation Distance > Near.

## Summary of Management Principles

**Algorithm for a Child with Esotropia:**
1.  **Assess Vision:** Rule out [[Amblyopia]]. If present, start **Occlusion Therapy**.
2.  **Cycloplegic Refraction:** Determine refractive error.
3.  **Give Glasses:**
    *   If eyes become straight -> **Accommodative Esotropia** (Continue glasses).
    *   If eyes remain crossed -> **Non-accommodative** (Infantile or Partially Accommodative).
4.  **Surgery:**
    *   For Infantile Esotropia: **Bimedial Recession** (recessing both medial recti).
    *   For Residual deviation (Partially accommodative): Surgery for the non-accommodative portion only.

### Surgical Procedures
*   **[[Recession]]:** Weakening procedure. The muscle is detached and re-sutured posterior to its original insertion. (e.g., Medial Rectus Recession for Esotropia).
    *   *Limit:* Medial rectus should not be recessed >5.5 mm to avoid convergence insufficiency.
*   **[[Resection]]:** Strengthening procedure. A portion of the muscle is excised and the muscle is reattached to the original insertion. (e.g., Lateral Rectus Resection).
