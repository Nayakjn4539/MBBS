# [[Demography And Family Planning]] > Family Planning Methods

### Classification of Family Planning Methods

Family planning methods are broadly classified into two main categories based on their intent and reversibility:
1.  **Spacing Methods (Temporary/Reversible):** Used to delay the first pregnancy or space between children.
2.  **Terminal Methods (Permanent/Irreversible):** Used when the couple has achieved their desired family size.

---

### I. Spacing Methods (Temporary)

These are used to postpone or space births. They are further classified as follows:

#### A. Barrier Methods
These methods prevent the live sperm from meeting the ovum.
1.  **Physical Barriers:**
    *   **[[Condom]] (Male):** Made of Latex. Most widely known (Trade name: **Nirodh**).
        *   *Advantages:* Cheap, easy to use, no side effects. **Only method that protects against [[STDs]] and [[HIV/AIDS]]**.
        *   *Failure Rate:* 2-14 per 100 woman-years (HWY).
    *   **Female Condom:** Made of Polyurethane (FC1) or Nitrile (FC2). Can be inserted up to 8 hours before intercourse.
    *   **Diaphragm (Dutch Cap):** Vaginal barrier. Must be used with spermicidal jelly. Must remain in place for 6 hours after intercourse but not >24 hours (Risk of **Toxic Shock Syndrome**).

2.  **Chemical Barriers (Spermicides):**
    *   Foams, jellies, pastes, soluble films.
    *   Contain surface-active agents (e.g., Nonoxynol-9) that attach to spermatozoa and inhibit oxygen uptake.
    *   *High failure rate* when used alone; best used with physical barriers.

3.  **Combined Barriers:**
    *   **Vaginal Sponge ([[Today]]):** Polyurethane foam saturated with **Nonoxynol-9**. inserted before intercourse and left for 6 hours after.

#### B. Intra-Uterine Devices (IUDs)

| Generation | Type | Example | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1st Gen** | **Inert/Non-medicated** | [[Lippes Loop]] | Made of polyethylene. Rare now. |
| **2nd Gen** | **Copper-bearing** | **[[Cu-T 380A]]**, Cu-T 200, Multiload 375 | Copper has strong anti-fertility effect. **Cu-T 380A approved for 10 years**. |
| **3rd Gen** | **Hormone-releasing** | **[[Progestasert]]**, **[[Mirena]]** (LNG-20) | Releases Progesterone/Levonorgestrel. **Reduces menstrual bleeding**. Effective life: 1-5 years. |

*   **Mechanism of Action:** Foreign body reaction, cellular/biochemical changes in endometrium impairing sperm viability, copper ions affect sperm motility,.
*   **Ideal Candidate:** Has borne at least one child, no history of pelvic disease, normal menstrual periods.
*   **Contraindications:**
    *   **Absolute:** Suspected pregnancy, Pelvic Inflammatory Disease ([[PID]]), Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, Cancer of cervix/uterus, Previous ectopic pregnancy.
    *   *Mnemonic for Contraindications:* **PAD P** (**P**regnancy, **A**nomalies of uterus, **D**isease (PID/Cancer), **P**revious Ectopic/Bleeding).

#### C. Hormonal Methods
Highly effective spacing methods.
1.  **Oral Contraceptive Pills (OCPs):**
    *   **Combined Pills (COCs):** Contains Estrogen (Ethinyl estradiol) + Progestogen.
        *   Examples: **Mala-N** (Free) and **Mala-D** (Rs. 3/packet).
        *   *Mechanism:* Primarily inhibits [[ovulation]].
        *   *Benefits:* Protects against Ovarian and Endometrial cancer, Iron deficiency anemia, Ectopic pregnancy.
        *   *Contraindications:* Liver disease, Thromboembolism, Breast cancer, Breastfeeding (<6 months).
    *   **Progestogen Only Pill ([[POP]]/Mini-pill):** No estrogen. Indicated for **lactating mothers** or older women where estrogen is contraindicated.
    *   **Centchroman ([[Chhaya]]/Saheli):**
        *   **Non-steroidal**, non-hormonal pill. Developed by CDRI, Lucknow.
        *   *Dosage:* Twice weekly for first 3 months, then **once a week**.
        *   *Mechanism:* Prevents implantation,.

2.  **Injectable Contraceptives (Depot Formulations):**
    *   **DMPA ([[Antara]]):** Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate.
        *   Dose: 150 mg IM every **3 months**.
    *   **NET-EN:** Norethisterone Enanthate.
        *   Dose: 200 mg IM every **2 months**.

3.  **Subdermal Implants:**
    *   **Norplant:** 6 silastic capsules containing Levonorgestrel implanted under skin of forearm. Effective for 5 years.

#### D. Natural Family Planning
*   **Calendar/Rhythm Method:**
    *   *Formula:* First fertile day = Shortest cycle minus 18. Last fertile day = Longest cycle minus 10.
*   **Basal Body Temperature (BBT):** Rise of 0.3°C to 0.5°C at ovulation.
*   **Cervical Mucus Method (Billings):** Based on "egg-white" slippery mucus at ovulation.
*   **Lactational Amenorrhea Method ([[LAM]]):** Effective if exclusive breastfeeding, amenorrhea present, and infant <6 months.

#### E. Post-Conceptional / Emergency Contraception
*   Used within **72 hours** of unprotected intercourse.
*   **[[Levonorgestrel]] (1.5 mg):** Single dose (preferred) or two doses of 0.75 mg 12 hours apart. E.g., **i-Pill**, **Ezy Pill**.
*   **IUD Insertion:** Effective if inserted within 5 days of unprotected intercourse.

### II. Terminal Methods (Sterilization)

Permanent methods for couples who have completed their family size.

#### A. Male Sterilization ([[Vasectomy]])
*   **Procedure:** Resection of a piece of **Vas Deferens**.
*   **Techniques:**
    *   **Conventional:** Scalpel used.
    *   **No-Scalpel Vasectomy ([[NSV]]):** Preferred method. Puncture technique. Faster, less pain, fewer complications, "Key-hole vasectomy",.
*   **Important Clinical Note:** The patient is **NOT immediately sterile**.
    *   Must use barrier contraception for **3 months** or **30 ejaculations** post-op.
*   *Advantages:* Safer, simpler, and cheaper than tubectomy.

#### B. Female Sterilization ([[Tubectomy]])
*   **Procedure:** Blocking/cutting of Fallopian tubes.
*   **Techniques:**
    *   **Laparoscopy:** Abdominal approach using laparoscope. Interval procedure (when not pregnant). Shorter stay.
    *   **Mini-laparotomy (Pomeroy’s):** Small incision. Common for **Post-partum sterilization** (24-36 hours after delivery).
*   *Effectiveness:* Immediate sterility. Failure rate <0.5%.

### Summary Table: Failure Rates (Pearl Index)
The [[Pearl Index]] measures contraceptive failure (Failures per 100 Woman-Years).

| Method | Pearl Index (Failure Rate) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **No Method** | 80 |
| **Male Condom** | 2 - 14 |
| **IUD (Cu-T 380A)** | 0.5 - 0.8 |
| **Oral Pills (Combined)** | 0.1 - 0.5 |
| **Male Sterilization** | 0.15 (Lowest) |
| **Female Sterilization** | 0.5 |
| **Centchroman** | 1.83 - 2.84 |

*(Lower number = Higher efficacy)*,.
