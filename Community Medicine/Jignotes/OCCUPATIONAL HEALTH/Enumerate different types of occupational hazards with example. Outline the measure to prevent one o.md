# [[OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH]] > Enumerate different types of occupational hazards with example. Outline the measure to prevent one of those.

**Occupational Health** deals with the promotion and maintenance of the highest degree of physical, mental, and social well-being of workers in all occupations. The hazards faced by workers are diverse and depend on the specific nature of their job.

### **I. Classification of Occupational Hazards**

An industrial worker may be exposed to five main types of hazards:

**Mnemonic:** **P**hysics **C**hemistry **B**iology **M**akes **P**sychology (**P**hysical, **C**hemical, **B**iological, **M**echanical, **P**sychosocial)

| Type of Hazard | Agents / Factors | Examples of Diseases/Conditions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. [[Physical Hazards]]** | **Heat** | Heat stroke, heat cramps, heat exhaustion, burns. |
| | **Cold** | Trench foot, frostbite, chilblains. |
| | **Light** | **Occupational cataract**, miner's nystagmus (due to poor illumination). |
| | **Pressure** | **[[Caisson disease]]** (decompression sickness), air embolism. |
| | **Noise** | Occupational deafness, nervousness, fatigue. |
| | **Radiation** | Cancer, leukemia, aplastic anemia, sterility (X-rays, radioactive isotopes). |
| | **Vibration** | "White fingers" (vascular spasm), injury to joints. |
| | **Electricity** | Burns, shock. |
| **2. [[Chemical Hazards]]** | **Dusts** | **[[Pneumoconiosis]]** (Silicosis, Anthracosis, Asbestosis, Byssinosis). |
| | **Gases** | Gas poisoning (CO, HCN, SO2), asphyxiation. |
| | **Metals** | **Lead poisoning ([[Plumbism]])**, mercury poisoning, chromium ulcers. |
| | **Solvents** | Benzene (leukemia), carbon bisulphide, chloroform. |
| **3. [[Biological Hazards]]** | **Infective Agents** | Brucellosis, **[[Anthrax]]**, Leptospirosis, Tetanus, Hydatidosis, Psittacosis, Fungal infections. |
| **4. [[Mechanical Hazards]]** | **Machinery** | Injuries, accidents, trauma from protruding/moving parts. |
| **5. [[Psychosocial Hazards]]** | **Stressors** | Frustration, lack of job satisfaction, insecurity, emotional tension leading to hypertension, peptic ulcer, and behavioral changes. |

### **II. Prevention of Occupational Diseases**

The measures for the prevention of occupational diseases (specifically focusing on **Chemical/Dust hazards** and general safety) are grouped under three major heads: **Medical**, **Engineering**, and **Legislative** measures.

> A flow chart showing three pillars of prevention: Medical Measures, Engineering Measures, and Legislation

#### **A. Medical Measures**
These measures are directed towards the worker's health status.

1.  **Pre-placement Examination:**
    *   This is the foundation of an efficient occupational health service.
    *   **Goal:** To place the right man in the right job ([[Ergonomics]]).
    *   **Function:** It establishes a baseline for future comparison and prevents putting a worker in a job that might be dangerous to them (e.g., a person with asthma should not be employed in dusty industries).

2.  **Periodical Examination:**
    *   Essential for early diagnosis and treatment (Secondary Prevention).
    *   **Frequency:** Depends on the hazard (e.g., monthly for lead/radium, daily for dichromates, annually for others).
    *   Helps detect early signs of disease before disability occurs.

3.  **Medical and Health Care Services:**
    *   Provision of first aid services within the factory.
    *   Immunization (e.g., Tetanus, Hep B).

4.  **Notification:**
    *   Certain diseases are **notifiable** under the [[Factories Act, 1948]] (e.g., Silicosis, Lead poisoning) to initiate investigation and control measures.

5.  **Supervision of Working Environment:**
    *   Periodic inspection by physicians/hygienists to check temperature, lighting, ventilation, and sanitation.

6.  **Health Education:**
    *    educating workers about risks, personal hygiene (hand washing), and the correct use of protective devices (masks, gloves).

#### **B. Engineering Measures**
These measures are designed to control the hazard at the source or remove it from the environment.

1.  **Design of Building:** Proper floor space, walls, and cubic space (minimum **500 cu. ft.** per worker) should be planned in the blueprint stage.
2.  **Good Housekeeping:** General cleanliness, wet sweeping to prevent dust, and whitewashing walls.
3.  **General Ventilation:** Adequate circulation of fresh air to decrease airborne hazards.
4.  **Mechanization:** Replacing hand processes with machines (e.g., machine mixing of chemicals to prevent dermatitis).
5.  **Substitution:** Replacing a harmful substance with a harmless or less toxic one.
    *   *Example:* Using **Phosphorus sesquisulphide** instead of white phosphorus to prevent "Phossy jaw"; using silver salts instead of mercury.
6.  **Dust Control:** Using wet methods (wet drilling) to suppress dust at the point of origin.
7.  **Enclosure:** Enclosing harmful processes (e.g., grinding machinery) to prevent dust/fumes from escaping.
8.  **Isolation:** Separating the offensive process from the rest of the workers or doing dangerous work at night when fewer people are present.
9.  **Local Exhaust Ventilation:** Using hoods and suction drafts to trap dust/fumes at the source before they enter the breathing zone.
10. **Protective Devices:** Use of Personal Protective Equipment (**PPE**) like respirators, gas masks, earplugs, helmets, aprons, and goggles. *Note: This is the last line of defense*.
11. **Environmental Monitoring:** Periodical surveys to ensure pollutants are within permissible limits.

#### **C. Legislative Measures**
Society has an obligation to protect the worker. In India, the **[[Factories Act, 1948]]** and the **[[Employees State Insurance Act, 1948]]** (ESI Act) lay down standards for health, safety, and welfare.

### **Clinical Relevance**
**Occupational History:** In clinical practice, always ask, *"What is your job?"* and *"Does the problem improve when you are away from work?"* This simple history can reveal the etiology of conditions like asthma (dust), dermatitis (chemicals), or hearing loss (noise).
