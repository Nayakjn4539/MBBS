# [[Klippel-Feil Syndrome]]

### **Synonyms**
*   [[Congenital short neck]]
*   [[Cervical-vertebral synostosis]]

### **Definition and Etiology**
*   **Definition:** A condition characterized by the failure of vertebral segmentation, leading to the fusion of cervical vertebrae.
*   **Genetics:** A familial pattern of inheritance is occasionally noted, suggesting a genetic aetiology.

### **Pathology**
*   The primary defect is an error in segmentation during development.
*   This results in **hemivertebrae**, with or without the fusion of vertebrae together.
*   It may present as complete absence (**agenesis**) of one or more vertebrae or errors in segmentation (**dysgenesis**).

### **Associated Anomalies**
[[Klippel-Feil syndrome]] is frequently associated with a variety of skeletal and visceral abnormalities.

| System | Associated Defects |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Spine/Neural** | • [[Hemivertebrae]]<br>• Posterior arch defects<br>• [[Cervical meningomyelocele]]<br>• [[Spina bifida]] (dysraphism) |
| **Shoulder/Thorax** | • [[Scapular elevation]]<br>• Thoracic defects |
| **Visceral** | • [[Renal abnormalities]]<br>• [[Cardiorespiratory system]] defects |

**Clinical Implications:**
*   Due to the high association of visceral anomalies, patients diagnosed with [[Klippel-Feil syndrome]] require a thorough workup involving the renal and cardiorespiratory systems to rule out life-threatening comorbidities.
