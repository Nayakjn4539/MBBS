# [[Thyroid Ophthalmopathy]] (Graves’ Ophthalmopathy)

**[[Thyroid Ophthalmopathy]]**, also known as **[[Thyroid Eye Disease]] (TED)**, **Graves' Ophthalmopathy**, or **Dysthyroid Ophthalmopathy**, is an organ-specific autoimmune inflammation of the orbital tissues.

### **Overview and Epidemiology**
*   It is the **most common cause** of unilateral and bilateral [[proptosis]] in adults.
*   **Thyroid Status:**
    *   **Hyperthyroidism:** 90% of cases (Graves' disease).
    *   **Euthyroid:** 6% (Ophthalmic Graves' disease).
    *   **Hypothyroidism:** 4% (Hashimoto's thyroiditis).
*   **Gender:** Females are affected more frequently than males (approx. 4–6:1 ratio).
*   **Risk Factors:**
    *   **Smoking:** Strongest modifiable risk factor; increases risk and severity of the disease.
    *   **Radioiodine therapy:** Can exacerbate active eye disease.
    *   **Age:** Middle age (usually 30–50 years).

### **Pathogenesis**
It is an autoimmune disorder where **[[Orbital Fibroblasts]]** are the primary target.
1.  **Infiltration:** T-lymphocytes infiltrate orbital tissues.
2.  **Cytokine Release:** Activation of fibroblasts to produce **[[Glycosaminoglycans]] (GAGs)** (hyaluronic acid).
3.  **Osmotic Effect:** GAGs are hydrophilic $\rightarrow$ Water retention $\rightarrow$ **Edema**.
4.  **Consequences:**
    *   Enlargement of extraocular muscles (up to 8x normal size).
    *   Increase in orbital fat volume.
    *   Increased [[Intraorbital Pressure]].

### **Clinical Features**
The disease typically follows **Rundle's Curve**: An active inflammatory phase (progressive) followed by a stable, fibrotic (burn-out) phase.

#### **1. Eyelid Signs**
These are due to sympathetic overstimulation of Muller's muscle, fibrosis of [[Levator Palpebrae Superioris]] (LPS), and proptosis.

| Sign | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Dalrymple's Sign]]** | **Lid retraction** in primary gaze (Visible upper sclera). Most common sign. |
| **[[Von Graefe's Sign]]** | **Lid lag** on downgaze (Upper lid lags behind the globe). |
| **[[Kocher's Sign]]** | Staring/frightened appearance. |
| **[[Stellwag's Sign]]** | Infrequent and incomplete blinking. |
| **[[Mobius Sign]]** | Weakness of convergence. |
| **[[Gifford's Sign]]** | Difficulty in everting the upper lid. |
| **[[Enroth's Sign]]** | Puffy oedema of eyelids. |
| **[[Jellinek's Sign]]** | Hyperpigmentation of the superior eyelid. |

**Clinical Implication:** Lid retraction leads to **[[Exposure Keratopathy]]** (dryness, ulceration) and cosmetic disfigurement.

#### **2. Soft Tissue Involvement**
*   **Symptoms:** Lacrimation, photophobia, retrobulbar pain (pain behind the eye), pain on eye movement.
*   **Signs:**
    *   Lid and periorbital edema.
    *   Conjunctival chemosis (edema) and congestion (especially over insertions of rectus muscles).
    *   **[[Superior Limbic Keratoconjunctivitis]] (SLK):** Specific inflammatory condition of the superior bulbar conjunctiva.

#### **3. Proptosis (Exophthalmos)**
*   Usually **Axial** (straight forward).
*   Can be unilateral or bilateral.
*   Usually permanent due to fibrosis of retrobulbar tissues.
*   **Measurement:** [[Hertel's Exophthalmometer]] is the standard instrument.

#### **4. Restrictive Thyroid Myopathy**
*   **Mechanism:** Inflammation followed by fibrosis of extraocular muscles causes **restriction** (not palsy).
*   **Sequence of Involvement (Mnemonic: I'M SLow):**
    1.  **[[Inferior Rectus]]** (Most common): Causes restriction of elevation (hypotropia).
    2.  **[[Medial Rectus]]**: Causes restriction of abduction (esotropia).
    3.  **[[Superior Rectus]]**.
    4.  **[[Lateral Rectus]]** (Least common).
*   **Symptoms:** **[[Diplopia]]** (double vision).
*   **Test:** **[[Forced Duction Test]]** is positive (confirms mechanical restriction).

#### **5. Dysthyroid Optic Neuropathy (DON)**
*   Occurs in ~5% of cases but is sight-threatening.
*   **Cause:** Compression of the **[[Optic Nerve]]** at the orbital apex by enlarged, crowded rectus muscles (muscles are largest at the apex).
*   **Signs:**
    *   Decreased visual acuity.
    *   **[[Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect]] (RAPD)**.
    *   Central scotoma or visual field defects.
    *   Defective color vision (Dyschromatopsia).
    *   Optic disc edema or pallor.

### **Classification Systems**

#### **1. Werner’s NOSPECS Classification**
*(Old but classic classification)*

| Class | Description | Mnemonic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | **N**o signs or symptoms | **N**o |
| **1** | **O**nly signs (lid retraction, stare, lag), no symptoms | **O**nly |
| **2** | **S**oft tissue involvement (edema, chemosis) | **S**oft |
| **3** | **P**roptosis (>3mm above normal) | **P**roptosis |
| **4** | **E**xtraocular muscle involvement (Diplopia) | **E**xtraocular |
| **5** | **C**orneal involvement (Exposure keratitis) | **C**ornea |
| **6** | **S**ight loss (Optic nerve compression) | **S**ight |

#### **2. Clinical Activity Score (CAS)**
Used to determine if the disease is **Active** (inflammatory) or **Inactive** (fibrotic). Treatment depends on this score.
*   Based on signs of inflammation: Pain (spontaneous/on movement), Redness (lids/conjunctiva), Swelling (lids/caruncle/chemosis).
*   **Score ≥ 3/7** indicates active disease.

#### **3. EUGOGO Classification (Severity Based)**
*   **Mild:** Minor impact on life.
*   **Moderate-to-Severe:** Significant impact (diplopia, proptosis >3mm).
*   **Sight-Threatening:** [[Dysthyroid Optic Neuropathy]] or corneal breakdown.

### **Diagnosis and Investigations**

1.  **Thyroid Function Tests:** T3, T4, TSH.
2.  **Antibody Assay:** Anti-TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb).
3.  **Imaging (USG / CT / MRI):**
    *   **Feature:** Enlargement of the **muscle belly** with **sparing of the tendon** (Fusiform enlargement).
    *   *Contrast with [[Orbital Myositis]] (pseudotumor) where the tendon is involved.*
    *   **CT Scan:** Best for visualizing bony orbit for decompression planning.
    *   **MRI:** Better for assessing soft tissue activity (edema).

### **Management**

#### **A. General Measures**
*   **Cessation of Smoking:** Crucial for prognosis.
*   Restore Euthyroid state (treat systemic thyroid disease).
*   Head elevation (reduces morning edema).
*   Lubricants (Artificial tears/gel) for corneal protection.
*   Sunglasses for photophobia.

#### **B. Medical Management (Active Phase)**
Used when CAS ≥ 3 (Inflammatory phase).
1.  **Corticosteroids:** Mainstay of treatment.
    *   **Intravenous Methylprednisolone (IVMP)** pulse therapy is superior to oral steroids.
2.  **Immunosuppressants:** Azathioprine, Methotrexate (if steroid intolerant).
3.  **Orbital Radiotherapy:** Used in combination with steroids or if steroids fail.

#### **C. Surgical Management (Inactive Phase)**
Surgery is usually performed in the fibrotic/quiescent phase (except for emergencies). The **Sequence of Surgery** is critical:

1.  **[[Orbital Decompression]]** (First): Removing bony walls (floor, medial, lateral) to create space for orbital contents.
2.  **[[Strabismus Surgery]]** (Second): To correct diplopia (Recession of tight muscles; resection is contraindicated).
3.  **[[Eyelid Surgery]]** (Last): Blepharoplasty or correction of lid retraction (e.g., Mullerotomy, LPS recession).

#### **D. Management of Emergencies (Sight-Threatening)**
If **[[Dysthyroid Optic Neuropathy]]** or severe corneal exposure occurs:
*   High dose **IV Methylprednisolone** (Pulse therapy).
*   If no response in 48 hours $\rightarrow$ **Urgent Surgical Orbital Decompression**.
