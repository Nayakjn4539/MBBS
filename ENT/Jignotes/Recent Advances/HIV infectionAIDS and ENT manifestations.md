# HIV Infection/AIDS and ENT Manifestations

[[Human Immunodeficiency Virus]] (HIV) is a retrovirus that targets the immune system, specifically the [[CD4+ T-lymphocytes]]. The resulting immunodeficiency predisposes the host to a wide array of opportunistic infections and neoplasms. Otorhinolaryngological symptoms are extremely common, with over **40–50%** of patients presenting initially with ENT complaints, and up to **80%** developing them during the disease.

### Pathophysiology and Immunology
*   **Agent:** HIV Type 1 (most common/pathogenic) and HIV Type 2.
*   **Mechanism:** The virus uses reverse transcriptase to transcribe viral RNA into DNA. It attacks CD4 receptors on T-helper cells and macrophages.
*   **Immunological Staging:**
    *   Normal CD4 count: 600–1500 cells/mm³.
    *   Symptomatic/Early AIDS: CD4 < 500 cells/mm³.
    *   Severe AIDS/Life-threatening infections: CD4 < 200 cells/mm³.

### Otological Manifestations
Manifestations can affect the external, middle, and inner ear, as well as the facial nerve.

#### 1. External Ear
*   **[[Kaposi's Sarcoma]] (KS):** Can involve the concha, pinna, or external auditory canal (EAC). Appears as red-purple/violaceous non-blanching nodules or plaques,.
*   **Seborrheic Dermatitis:** Common on the pinna and scalp.
*   **[[Malignant Otitis Externa]] (Necrotizing Otitis Externa):**
    *   Typically seen in immunocompromised patients.
    *   **Organisms:** *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* (predominant) and *Aspergillus fumigatus*.
    *   **Features:** Severe otalgia, otorrhea, granulation tissue on the floor of EAC, cranial nerve palsies,.
*   **Fungal Infections:** *Candida* and *Aspergillus* otitis externa are common.

#### 2. Middle Ear
*   **[[Serous Otitis Media]] (SOM):** Very common (up to 80%).
    *   **Causes:** Eustachian tube dysfunction secondary to nasopharyngeal lymphoid hyperplasia (adenoid hypertrophy), recurrent viral infections, or nasopharyngeal neoplasms (KS or Lymphoma).
    *   **Management:** Ruling out nasopharyngeal mass is crucial. Myringotomy and grommet insertion may be required.
*   **Acute Otitis Media (AOM):** Recurrent. Caused by common pathogens like *Strep. pneumoniae*, *H. influenzae*.
*   **[[Pneumocystis carinii]] Mastoiditis:**
    *   Rare but distinct entity in AIDS.
    *   **Pathology:** Caused by *Pneumocystis jirovecii* (formerly *carinii*).
    *   **Clinical Features:** Otalgia, otorrhea, and hearing loss. Frequently presents with an **aural polyp** in the EAC.
    *   **Diagnosis:** Biopsy of the polyp stained with Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver nitrate,.

#### 3. Inner Ear and Neuro-otology
*   **[[Sensorineural Hearing Loss]] (SNHL):** Frequency ranges from 21–49%.
    *   **Causes:** Direct HIV effect (demyelination), Opportunistic infections (CMV, Syphilis, Cryptococcal meningitis), Ototoxic drugs (Aminoglycosides, Antiretrovirals).
    *   **Otosyphilis:** Accelerated course in HIV; may reactivate latent syphilis causing bilateral SNHL.
*   **Vertigo and Tinnitus:** Can result from CNS infections (encephalopathy) or medications.

#### 4. Facial Nerve Paralysis
*   **[[Ramsay Hunt Syndrome]] (Herpes Zoster Oticus):** Reactivation of Varicella Zoster Virus in the geniculate ganglion. Presents with severe pain, vesicles on concha/EAC, and facial palsy.
*   **Bell’s Palsy:** Can occur due to HIV seroconversion or direct neuropathic effects.

### Nasal and Sinus Manifestations

#### 1. Rhinitis
*   **Allergic Rhinitis:** High prevalence due to polyclonal B-cell activation and increased IgE levels,.
*   **Viral Rhinitis:** Herpetic lesions of the nose.

#### 2. Rhinosinusitis
*   Prevalence is high (20–68%). Can be acute, recurrent, or chronic.
*   **Bacterial:** *Strep. pneumoniae*, *H. influenzae*, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, *Staph. aureus*.
*   **Fungal:** *Aspergillus*, *Cryptococcus*, *Candida*.
*   **Unusual Pathogens:** *Legionella pneumophila*, *Acanthamoeba*, *Cytomegalovirus* (CMV),.
*   **[[Invasive Fungal Sinusitis]]:** Rapid tissue destruction, black eschar. Requires aggressive debridement,.

#### 3. Nasopharyngeal Lesions
*   **Adenoidal Hypertrophy:** Common in adults with HIV (unlike immunocompetent adults). Due to reactive lymphoid hyperplasia. Can cause nasal obstruction and SOM.
*   **Neoplasms:** Kaposi’s Sarcoma, [[Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma]] (NHL).

### Oral Cavity and Oropharyngeal Manifestations
Oral lesions are often the first sign of HIV infection and are markers of disease progression.

| Condition | Etiology | Clinical Features | Treatment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Oral Candidiasis]]** | *Candida albicans* | **Pseudomembranous (Thrush):** White curd-like plaques, removable.<br>**Erythematous:** Red patches (palate/tongue).<br>**Angular Cheilitis:** Fissures at mouth corners. | Clotrimazole, Fluconazole. |
| **[[Hairy Leukoplakia]]** | [[Epstein-Barr Virus]] (EBV) | White, vertically corrugated, hairy lesions on **lateral borders of tongue**. Cannot be wiped off. Strongly predictive of AIDS progression. | High dose Acyclovir/Zidovudine (often regresses spontaneously),. |
| **Herpes Simplex** | HSV | Recurrent, painful vesicles and ulcers (gingivostomatitis). | Acyclovir. |
| **Aphthous Ulcers** | Immune dysregulation | Giant, deep, painful ulcers. Persistent in severe immunodeficiency. | Steroids, Thalidomide. |
| **[[Kaposi's Sarcoma]]** | HHV-8 | Red/purple/brown macules, plaques, or nodules. Common on **hard palate** and gingiva. | Radiotherapy, Chemotherapy, HAART. |
| **Periodontal Disease** | Bacterial | Linear gingival erythema, Necrotizing Ulcerative Gingivitis (ANUG), Necrotizing Stomatitis. | Metronidazole, Debridement, Chlorhexidine. |

### Neck and Salivary Gland Manifestations

#### 1. Cervical Lymphadenopathy
*   **Persistent Generalized Lymphadenopathy (PGL):** Earliest sign. Nodes are soft, symmetric, non-tender, involving posterior triangle and occipital nodes.
*   **Infectious Lymphadenitis:**
    *   **Tuberculosis (Scrofula):** Common in endemic areas. Nodes may be matted or form abscesses.
    *   *Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare* (MAC).
    *   Toxoplasmosis.
*   **Neoplastic:** Lymphoma (NHL - rapidly enlarging, firm/rubbery nodes), Metastatic KS.

#### 2. Salivary Glands (Parotid)
*   **[[Benign Lymphoepithelial Cysts]]:** Characteristic of HIV. Present as bilateral, cystic, non-tender parotid enlargement. Associated with diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome (DILS),.
    *   **Imaging:** CT/MRI shows multiple thin-walled cysts ("Swiss cheese" appearance).
*   **Xerostomia:** Dry mouth due to glandular infiltration.

---

### Laryngeal Manifestations
*   **Infections:** Candidiasis (extending from pharynx), Herpes, CMV.
*   **Neoplasms:** Kaposi's sarcoma (violaceous lesions causing airway obstruction), Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.
*   **Neurological:** Vocal cord palsy due to CNS involvement or neuropathy.

### Diagnosis and Management

#### Diagnostic Tests
1.  **Screening:** [[ELISA]] (Sensitive).
2.  **Confirmation:** [[Western Blot]] (Specific).
3.  **Monitoring:** [[CD4 Count]] (predicts opportunistic risk) and Viral Load (PCR).

#### Treatment Principles
1.  **[[Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy]] (HAART):** Combination of Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTI), Non-Nucleoside RTIs (NNRTI), and Protease Inhibitors (PI). Restores immunity and reduces opportunistic infections.
2.  **Prophylaxis:** For opportunistic infections (e.g., Co-trimoxazole for *Pneumocystis*) based on CD4 levels.
3.  **Universal Precautions:** For healthcare workers to prevent occupational transmission (risk from needle stick is ~0.3%).

### Clinical Implications
*   **Adult Adenoids:** Adenoid hypertrophy in an adult is pathognomonic for HIV infection (if lymphoma is ruled out).
*   **Aural Polyp:** An aural polyp in an HIV patient should raise suspicion of *Pneumocystis* mastoiditis.
*   **Otosyphilis:** Always rule out syphilis in HIV patients with new-onset hearing loss; conventional serology may be negative (prozone phenomenon) or unreliable.
*   **Hairy Leukoplakia:** Its presence is a poor prognostic sign, indicating progression to AIDS.
