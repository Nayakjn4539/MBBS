# [[Concept Of Health And Disease]] > Concept of Control, Elimination and Eradication

### **Concepts of Disease Control, Elimination, and Eradication**

In [[Community Medicine]], the approach to managing infectious diseases follows a hierarchy of objectives ranging from reduction of burden to total extinction of the pathogen.

---

### **1. Disease Control**

*   **Definition:** Disease control describes operations aimed at reducing the incidence, duration, effects of infection, and financial burden to the community to a level where it is **no longer a public health problem**.
*   **Concept:** The disease agent is permitted to persist in the community.
*   **Mechanism:** A state of [[equilibrium]] is established between the disease agent, host, and environmental components.
*   **Intervention:** Continued intervention measures are required to maintain the reduction.
*   **Example:** [[Malaria Control]]. The vector and parasite remain, but measures are taken to keep cases low.

### **2. Disease Elimination**

*   **Definition:** Elimination refers to the **complete interruption of transmission** of disease in a defined **geographical area** (regional or national), though the causative organism may persist in the environment.
*   **Scope:** It is a **geographical term** (e.g., elimination from a country or region).
*   **Risk:** There is a risk of re-introduction from other areas.
*   **Intervention:** Continued measures are required to prevent re-establishment of transmission.
*   **Specific Examples & Criteria:**
    *   **[[Leprosy Elimination]]:** Defined as a prevalence rate of **<1 case per 10,000 population**. India achieved this at the national level in Dec 2005.
    *   **[[Neonatal Tetanus Elimination]]:** Defined as <1 case per 1,000 live births in every district.
    *   **Measles:** Regional elimination goals (e.g., in the Americas).

### **3. Disease Eradication**

*   **Definition:** Eradication literally means to "tear out by roots". It implies the **termination of all transmission of infection** by extermination of the infectious agent worldwide.
*   **Scope:** It is a **global term**. It is an **"All or None"** phenomenon.
*   **Status:** Intervention measures are **no longer needed** once eradication is achieved.
*   **Achieved Status:** To date, **[[Smallpox]]** is the *only* human disease eradicated globally (Declared by WHO on **8th May 1980**).
*   **Next Candidates:** [[Poliomyelitis]], [[Dracunculiasis]] (Guinea worm), and Measles.

### **Comparison: Control vs. Elimination vs. Eradication**

| Feature | **Control** | **Elimination** | **Eradication** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Goal** | Reduce morbidity/mortality to low levels | Zero incidence (no new cases) | Zero incidence worldwide; Agent extinction |
| **Geographical Scope** | Local/National | Regional/National (defined area) | **Global** (Worldwide) |
| **Agent Status** | Persists in community | May persist in environment/vectors | **Exterminated** |
| **Intervention** | Continued indefinitely | Continued to prevent re-importation | **Stopped** after certification |
| **Example** | Diarrheal diseases, Malaria | Polio (in many countries), Leprosy | **Smallpox** |

### **Clinical Relevance: Why was Smallpox Eradicated?**

Smallpox is the classic example used to teach the criteria necessary for a disease to be eradicable.

*   **No animal reservoir:** Man was the only host.
*   **No long-term carrier state:** The patient either died or recovered with immunity.
*   **No subclinical cases:** The disease was easily identifiable (frank clinical presentation).
*   **Lifelong immunity:** Infection conferred solid immunity.
*   **Effective Vaccine:** A freeze-dried, stable, and potent vaccine was available.
*   **International Cooperation:** Global political will.

> **Mnemonic for Eradicable Diseases Candidates:**
> **P**lease **M**ove **G**uinea **S**mall
> *   **P** - [[Poliomyelitis]]
> *   **M** - [[Measles]]
> *   **G** - [[Guinea worm]] (Dracunculiasis)
> *   **S** - [[Smallpox]] (Already Done)
