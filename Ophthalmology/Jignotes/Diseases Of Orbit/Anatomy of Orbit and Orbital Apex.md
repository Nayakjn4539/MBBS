# Anatomy of Orbit and Orbital Apex

## **Introduction to the Orbit**
The [[orbit]] is a bony cavity (socket) in the skull that houses the [[eyeball]], extraocular muscles, nerves, blood vessels, fat, and the lacrimal apparatus.

### **Gross Anatomy and Dimensions**
*   **Shape:** Each orbit is a quadrilateral pyramid-shaped bony cavity (pear-shaped), with the base directed forward (anteriorly) and the apex directed backward (posteriorly),,.
*   **Volume:** Approximately **30 cc**,,,.
*   **Dimensions:**
    *   Height (Vertical): ~35 mm.
    *   Width (Horizontal): ~40 mm.
    *   Depth (Antero-posterior): ~40–45 mm.
*   **Relationship:** The medial walls of the two orbits are parallel to each other, while the lateral walls are at an angle of 90 degrees to each other.

## **Bony Walls of the Orbit**
Seven bones contribute to the formation of the orbit.
**Mnemonic for 7 Bones:** **M**any **F**riendly **Z**ebras **E**njoy **L**azy **S**ummer **P**icnics (**M**axilla, **F**rontal, **Z**ygomatic, **E**thmoid, **L**acrimal, **S**phenoid, **P**alatine).

### **1. Roof (Superior Wall)**
*   **Formation:** Mainly formed by the **orbital plate of the frontal bone** and posteriorly by the **lesser wing of the sphenoid**,,.
*   **Features:**
    *   Triangular in shape.
    *   Separates the orbit from the anterior cranial fossa and the frontal sinus.
    *   Contains the **lacrimal fossa** (anterolaterally) for the [[lacrimal gland]].
    *   Contains the **trochlear fossa** (anteromedially) for the pulley of the [[superior oblique muscle]].

### **2. Lateral Wall**
*   **Formation:** **Zygomatic bone** (anteriorly) and the **greater wing of the sphenoid** (posteriorly),.
*   **Features:**
    *   It is the **thickest** and strongest wall,.
    *   Separates the orbit from the temporal fossa and middle cranial fossa.
    *   **Whitnall’s Tubercle:** A small elevation on the zygomatic bone just within the lateral orbital margin (attachment for lateral canthal tendon, check ligament of Lateral Rectus, etc.).

### **3. Floor (Inferior Wall)**
*   **Formation:** **Orbital surface of the Maxilla**, **Zygomatic bone**, and the **Orbital process of the Palatine bone**,,.
*   **Features:**
    *   Triangular in shape.
    *   Separates the orbit from the [[maxillary sinus]] below.
    *   **Clinical Implication:** It is quite thin and is the most common site for **Blow-out fractures** (blunt trauma causing herniation of contents into the maxillary antrum),,.
    *   Contains the **infraorbital groove** which becomes the **infraorbital canal** transmitting the infraorbital nerve and vessels.

### **4. Medial Wall**
*   **Formation:** **Maxilla** (frontal process), **Lacrimal bone**, **Ethmoid bone** (orbital plate/lamina papyracea), and **Sphenoid bone** (body),,.
*   **Mnemonic:** **SMEL** (**S**phenoid, **M**axilla, **E**thmoid, **L**acrimal).
*   **Features:**
    *   It is the **thinnest** wall (specifically the lamina papyracea of the ethmoid),.
    *   Separates the orbit from the ethmoid sinuses and nasal cavity.
    *   **Clinical Implication:** Infections from ethmoid sinuses frequently spread through this thin wall causing [[orbital cellulitis]].

| Wall | Bones Involved | Key Feature |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Roof** | Frontal, Sphenoid (Lesser Wing) | Lacrimal fossa location |
| **Lateral** | Zygomatic, Sphenoid (Greater Wing) | **Thickest/Strongest** |
| **Floor** | Maxilla, Zygomatic, Palatine | **Blow-out fractures** |
| **Medial** | Sphenoid, Maxilla, Ethmoid, Lacrimal | **Thinnest** (Lamina papyracea) |

## **Orbital Openings and Apertures**

### **1. Optic Canal (Optic Foramen)**
*   **Location:** At the apex, within the lesser wing of the sphenoid,.
*   **Contents:**
    1.  [[Optic Nerve]] (CN II).
    2.  [[Ophthalmic Artery]].
    3.  Sympathetic nerves.

### **2. Superior Orbital Fissure (SOF)**
*   **Location:** Between the **greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid** bone,.
*   **Division:** It is divided into two parts (intraconal and extraconal) by the **Annulus of Zinn** (Common Tendinous Ring).

**Contents passing through SOF:**

*   **Lateral Part (Outside Annulus of Zinn):**
    *   **L** - [[Lacrimal nerve]] (Branch of CN V1).
    *   **F** - [[Frontal nerve]] (Branch of CN V1).
    *   **T** - [[Trochlear nerve]] (CN IV).
    *   **S** - [[Superior Ophthalmic Vein]].
    *   *(Mnemonic: **L**ive **F**ree **T**o **S**ee)*

*   **Middle Part (Inside Annulus of Zinn/Intraconal):**
    *   **Superior division** of [[Oculomotor nerve]] (CN III).
    *   **Nasociliary nerve** (Branch of CN V1).
    *   **Inferior division** of [[Oculomotor nerve]] (CN III).
    *   **Abducent nerve** (CN VI).
    *   Sympathetic root of ciliary ganglion (sometimes).

### **3. Inferior Orbital Fissure (IOF)**
*   **Location:** Between the floor and the lateral wall (bounded by Maxilla, Sphenoid, and Palatine),.
*   **Contents:**
    *   [[Infraorbital nerve]] (Branch of V2).
    *   Zygomatic nerve.
    *   Inferior ophthalmic vein (communicates with pterygoid plexus).

## **Orbital Apex and Annulus of Zinn**

*   **Orbital Apex:** The posterior end of the orbit where the four walls converge. It contains the optic canal and the superior orbital fissure.
*   **Annulus of Zinn (Common Tendinous Ring):**
    *   A fibrous ring at the orbital apex encircling the optic foramen and the central part of the superior orbital fissure.
    *   **Origin:** It serves as the common origin for the four **Rectus muscles** (Superior, Inferior, Medial, Lateral),,.
    *   **Note:** The [[Superior Oblique]] arises *above* the Annulus (from the lesser wing of sphenoid), and the [[Inferior Oblique]] arises from the *orbital floor* (maxillary bone),.

## **Surgical Spaces of the Orbit**
Knowledge of these spaces is vital for surgery, local anesthesia, and understanding the spread of pathology.

1.  **Subperiosteal Space:** Potential space between the orbital bones and the periorbita (periosteum).
2.  **Peripheral Orbital Space (Extraconal):** Bounded peripherally by periorbita and internally by the four recti muscles/intermuscular septa. Contains orbital fat. **Peribulbar anesthesia** is injected here.
3.  **Central Space (Intraconal/Retrobulbar):** Bounded by Tenon's capsule anteriorly and the four recti muscles peripherally. Contains the optic nerve. **Retrobulbar anesthesia** is injected here,.
4.  **Sub-Tenon’s Space:** Potential space between the sclera and [[Tenon's capsule]].

---

## **Orbital Fascia and Connective Tissue**

*   **Periorbita:** The periosteum lining the orbital bones.
*   **Tenon’s Capsule (Fascia Bulbi):**
    *   A fibrous membrane enveloping the globe from the limbus to the optic nerve.
    *   Separates the globe from the orbital fat.
*   **Suspensory Ligament of Lockwood:**
    *   A hammock-like thickening of the lower part of Tenon's capsule.
    *   Extends from the posterior lacrimal crest to the lateral orbital tubercle.
    *   Supports the eyeball (prevents it from dropping if the orbital floor is fractured).

---

## **Clinical Implications**

1.  **Blow-out Fracture:** Blunt trauma (e.g., tennis ball) raises intraorbital pressure, causing the thin **floor** (maxilla) or **medial wall** (ethmoid) to fracture. Orbital contents herniate into the maxillary sinus ("Tear drop sign" on X-ray),.
2.  **Orbital Apex Syndrome:** Involvement of the orbital apex (structures in optic canal + SOF) leads to ophthalmoplegia (CN III, IV, VI), anesthesia of the cornea/forehead (CN V1), and **vision loss** (CN II),.
3.  **Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis:** Differentiated from Orbital Apex Syndrome by the presence of prominent systemic signs, bilateral involvement, and venous congestion, as the orbital veins drain into the cavernous sinus,.
4.  **Proptosis:**
    *   **Axial Proptosis:** Tumor within the muscle cone (Intraconal) e.g., [[Optic Nerve Glioma]], [[Cavernous Hemangioma]].
    *   **Eccentric Proptosis:** Tumor outside the muscle cone (Extraconal) e.g., Lacrimal gland tumors, Ethmoidal mucocele.
