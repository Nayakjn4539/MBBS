# [[Pregnancy And Infant Deaths]] > Impotence vs Sterility

### Definitions

**1. [[Impotence]]**
*   **Definition:** It is the inability to perform the sexual act (sexual intercourse).
*   In males, it is the inability to achieve or maintain an erection of the penis sufficient for successful penetration and ejaculation.
*   It is a physical incapacity to consummate the marriage.
*   **Female Equivalent:** Often termed as **[[Frigidity]]**, which is the sexual coldness or lack of desire for sexual intercourse (dyspareunia or vaginismus may lead to functional impotence in females).

**2. [[Sterility]]**
*   **Definition:** It is the inability to procreate or produce a child.
*   In males, it implies the absence of viable spermatozoa in the semen (azoospermia or necrozoospermia).
*   In females, it implies the inability to conceive or bear a child.

**Key Distinction:**
*   An **impotent** person is usually sterile (as they cannot deposit semen), but a **sterile** person is usually potent (can perform the act but cannot reproduce).

### Comparison: Impotence vs Sterility

| Feature | Impotence | Sterility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Defect** | Inability to perform sexual intercourse (coitus). | Inability to reproduce (procreate). |
| **Physical Ability** | Penile erection is absent or insufficient. | Penile erection is usually normal. |
| **Semen/Ovum** | May or may not contain viable gametes, but delivery fails. | Gametes are absent, defective, or cannot meet. |
| **Marriage Status** | Ground for **Nullity of Marriage** (Voidable marriage). | **NOT** a ground for Nullity (but may be ground for divorce under mental cruelty in some contexts). |
| **Medicolegal Weight** | High (Civil & Criminal cases). | High (Civil cases - legitimacy, divorce). |
| **Treatment** | Medical (Sildenafil), Surgical (Implants), Psychotherapy. | ART (IVF, IUI), Surgery, Hormonal. |

### Classification and Causes

#### 1. Causes of Impotence
Can be broadly classified into **Psychological** and **Organic**.

**A. Psychological (Psychogenic)**
*   Most common cause (approx. 90% in young males).
*   **[[Impotence Quod Hanc]]:** A specific form where a man is impotent *only* towards a particular woman (usually the wife) due to psychological aversion, disgust, or fear, but is potent with other women.
*   Causes: Fear of failure, anxiety, guilt, religious inhibitions, incompatible partners.

**B. Organic (Physical)**
*   **Congenital:**
    *   Extreme [[Hypospadias]] or Epispadias.
    *   Micropenis or absent penis.
    *   Exstrophy of bladder.
*   **Acquired/Pathological:**
    *   **Local:** Trauma to penis, amputation, elephantiasis, large hydrocele/hernia, Peyronie's disease.
    *   **General/Systemic:** [[Diabetes Mellitus]] (commonest organic cause), spinal cord injuries, tabes dorsalis, chronic alcoholism, drug abuse (heroin, cocaine).
    *   **Iatrogenic:** Side effects of drugs (antihypertensives, antidepressants, antipsychotics), post-surgical nerve damage.

> *   **V**ascular diseases (Atherosclerosis)
> *   **I**nflammation/Infection (Mumps orchitis)
> *   **A**natomical defects (Hypospadias)
> *   **G**eneral diseases (Diabetes)
> *   **R**adiation/Renal failure
> *   **A**ddiction (Alcohol/Drugs) / Anxiety

#### 2. Causes of Sterility
**A. In Males**
*   **Azoospermia:** Absence of sperms (testicular atrophy, Klinefelter’s syndrome).
*   **Oligospermia:** Low sperm count.
*   **Necrozoospermia:** Dead sperms.
*   **Obstruction:** Blockage of vas deferens (post-vasectomy or gonococcal infection).
*   **Orchitis:** Following mumps (bilateral).
*   **Trauma:** Castration.

**B. In Females**
*   Absence of uterus or ovaries (Turner’s syndrome).
*   Blocked fallopian tubes (PID, Tuberculosis).
*   Disorders of ovulation.
*   **[[Vaginismus]]:** Painful spasm of vaginal muscles preventing entry (can cause functional sterility/impotence).

### Medicolegal Aspects

**1. Civil Cases**
*   **Nullity of Marriage:** Under Section 12 of the [[Hindu Marriage Act, 1955]], a marriage is **voidable** if the respondent was impotent at the time of marriage and continued to be so until the institution of the proceedings.
    *   *Note:* Sterility is generally *not* a ground for nullity, though concealment of it prior to marriage may be argued as fraud or cruelty leading to **Divorce** (Sec 13 HMA).
*   **Adoption:** Proof of potency/fertility may be required.
*   **Legitimacy of Child:** A child born to an impotent father may be declared illegitimate (unless [[Artificial Insemination]] or [[Surrogacy]] is involved).
*   **Artificial Insemination (AIH/AID):** Used to overcome sterility. Legal issues arise regarding the legitimacy of the child if donor sperm (AID) is used without husband's consent (amounts to adultery in some interpretations, though legally complex).

**2. Criminal Cases**
*   **Rape:** An accused may plead impotence as a defense.
    *   *Law:* The law requires "penetration" for rape. If an accused can prove total physical impotence (incapability of erection), it may be a valid defense against rape, though he may still be liable for sexual assault or abetment.
    *   However, a sterile man *can* commit rape.
*   **Adultery:** An impotent man cannot commit adultery (which requires penetration), but he can be an abettor.

### Examination of Potency

When a subject is referred for potency testing (usually the accused in a rape case or a husband in a nullity suit):

1.  **Consent:** Informed written consent is mandatory.
2.  **History:** Past sexual history, morning erections, masturbation, drug history, diseases (mumps, diabetes).
3.  **Physical Examination:**
    *   **Genitalia:** Size of penis, position of meatus, presence of both testes, sensations (cremasteric reflex), scars/injuries.
    *   **Secondary Sexual Characters:** Pubic hair distribution, voice, muscular build.
4.  **Special Tests:**
    *   **NPT ([[Nocturnal Penile Tumescence]]):** Monitoring erections during REM sleep. Presence of NPT confirms psychological impotence; absence suggests organic cause.
    *   **Intracavernosal Injection:** Injection of vasoactive agents (Papaverine/Prostaglandin) to induce erection.
    *   **Semen Analysis:** For sterility (Count, Motility, Morphology).
    *   **Bulbocavernosus Reflex:** To check nerve integrity.

### Summary of Key Differences for Exams

*   **Potent but Sterile:** A man who has had a vasectomy. He can perform intercourse (potent) but cannot get a woman pregnant (sterile).
*   **Impotent but Fertile:** A man with paraplegia (paralysis) who cannot achieve an erection (impotent) but produces healthy sperm which can be extracted for artificial insemination (fertile).
