# [[Diseases Of Conjunctiva]] > Purulent Conjunctivitis

### Purulent Conjunctivitis (Hyperacute Bacterial Conjunctivitis)

**Purulent Conjunctivitis**, also known as **Acute Blennorrhoea**, is a severe form of conjunctivitis characterized by a violent inflammatory response and copious purulent discharge. It is distinct from acute mucopurulent conjunctivitis due to its severity and rapidity of onset.

#### Etiology and Pathogens
The condition typically affects adults, predominantly males, or newborns (Ophthalmia Neonatorum).
*   **Most Common Cause:** [[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]] (Gonococcus).
*   **Other Causative Organisms:**
    *   [[Neisseria meningitidis]] (Meningococcus).
    *   [[Staphylococcus aureus]].
    *   [[Streptococcus pyogenes]] (Hemolyticus).
    *   *Haemophilus aegyptius*.
    *   *Pseudomonas pyocyanea* (Virulent, invades cornea).

**Mode of Infection:**
*   **Adults:** Usually direct spread from genitals to the eye (oculogenital transmission).
*   **Newborns:** Maternal infection acquired during birth.

#### Clinical Features
The onset is **hyperacute**, typically developing within 12 to 24 hours of infection.

**Symptoms:**
*   **Discharge:** Copious, thick, purulent discharge that trickles down the cheeks. Reaccumulates within seconds of cleaning.
*   **Pain:** Moderate to severe ocular pain.
*   **Swelling:** Marked swelling of eyelids (often overhanging).
*   **Photophobia:** Mild to severe difficulty tolerating light.

**Signs:**
*   **Lids:** Tense, tender, and markedly swollen (woody hardness).
*   **Conjunctiva:**
    *   Marked [[Chemosis]] (swelling of conjunctiva).
    *   Bright red, velvety appearance due to congestion and papillae.
    *   **Pseudomembrane** formation is frequent on the conjunctival surface.
*   **Lymphadenopathy:** Enlarged and **tender** [[Preauricular lymph nodes]]. Suppuration of lymph nodes may occur.

#### Complications
This condition carries a high risk of ocular morbidity due to the aggressive nature of the bacteria.

1.  **Corneal Involvement:**
    *   *N. gonorrhoeae* has the unique ability to invade **intact corneal epithelium**.
    *   Manifests as diffuse haze, edema, central necrosis, or marginal ulceration.
    *   Risk of rapid **perforation**,.
2.  **Iridocyclitis:** Inflammation of the iris and ciliary body.
3.  **Systemic Spread:** Rare but possible complications include gonococcal arthritis, endocarditis, and septicemia.

#### Diagnosis
*   **Clinical:** Based on hyperacute onset and copious purulence.
*   **Microbiology:**
    *   **Gram Stain:** Essential for immediate identification. Gonococci appear as **Gram-negative intracellular diplococci** (kidney-shaped).
    *   **Culture:** Required for confirmation and antibiotic sensitivity (e.g., Thayer-Martin agar for Neisseria).

#### Treatment
This is an **ocular emergency**. Treatment must be prompt to prevent corneal melting and blindness.

**Systemic Therapy (Critical):**
Systemic antibiotics are far more critical than topical therapy for *N. gonorrhoeae*.
*   **Ceftriaxone:** 1g IM/IV daily for 5 days (or single dose in mild cases).
*   **Alternatives:** Cefotaxime or Spectinomycin (for penicillin-allergic patients).
*   **Adjunct:** One week of Doxycycline or Erythromycin is usually added to treat co-existing [[Chlamydia trachomatis]] infection.

**Topical Therapy:**
*   **Antibiotics:** Intensive instillation of Ciprofloxacin, Ofloxacin, or Tobramycin drops every 2 hours initially.
*   **Irrigation:** Frequent [[Saline lavage]] to wash away infected debris and discharge is highly therapeutic.
*   **Cycloplegics:** [[Atropine]] 1% drops if the cornea is involved.

**General Measures:**
*   **Contact Tracing:** Sexual partners must be examined and treated.
*   **Screening:** Evaluate for other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).

### Clinical Implications: Organisms Penetrating Intact Cornea
It is vital to remember which organisms can penetrate a healthy, intact corneal epithelium, as this dictates the urgency of treatment to prevent perforation.

**Mnemonic: High Level CNS**
*   **H** - *Haemophilus aegyptius*
*   **L** - *Listeria*
*   **C** - *Corynebacterium diphtheriae*
*   **N** - *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*
*   **S** - *Shigella*
*   (Also *Neisseria meningitidis*)

### Differentiating Purulent vs. Mucopurulent Conjunctivitis

| Feature | Purulent (Hyperacute) | Mucopurulent (Acute) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Causative Agent** | *N. gonorrhoeae*, *N. meningitidis* | *Staph. aureus*, *Pneumococcus*, *Koch-Weeks bacillus* |
| **Onset** | Hyperacute (12-24 hours) | Acute (1-2 days) |
| **Discharge** | Copious, thick, purulent | Mucopurulent, lashes matted |
| **Lid Swelling** | Marked, tense, tender | Mild to moderate |
| **Lymph Nodes** | **Tender** preauricular nodes | Usually absent or non-tender |
| **Corneal Risk** | High (can invade intact cornea) | Lower (needs epithelial damage usually) |
