# Pseudogout (Calcium Pyrophosphate Dihydrate Deposition Disease)

### Definition and Terminology
**Pseudogout** (also known as CPPD or [[Calcium Pyrophosphate Dihydrate]] Crystal Deposition Disease) is a crystal-induced arthropathy caused by the deposition of **calcium pyrophosphate** crystals in the joint tissues, particularly the hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage.
*   **Chondrocalcinosis**: This refers specifically to the radiological finding of calcification within the cartilage (articular cartilage or menisci).
*   The term "Pseudogout" is used because the acute clinical presentation closely mimics [[Gout]].

### Etiology and Associations
While often idiopathic (associated with aging), [[Pseudogout]] is frequently associated with specific metabolic and endocrine disorders.

*   **Aging:** It is rare before 40 years of age; prevalence increases with age.
*   **Metabolic Associations (The 5 H's Mnemonic):**
    1.  **H**yperparathyroidism.
    2.  **H**emochromatosis.
    3.  **H**ypophosphatasia.
    4.  **H**ypomagnesemia.
    5.  **H**ypothyroidism.
*   **Other associations:** [[Gout]], [[Wilson's disease]], and trauma.

### Pathogenesis
1.  **Crystal Formation:** There is an accumulation of pyrophosphate in the synovial fluid/cartilage matrix.
2.  **Deposition:** [[Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate]] crystals deposit in the articular cartilage (chondrocalcinosis).
3.  **Shedding:** These crystals are "shed" from the cartilage into the [[synovial cavity]].
4.  **Inflammation:** The crystals are phagocytosed by neutrophils, releasing inflammatory mediators/enzymes, leading to acute synovitis (similar to urate crystals in gout).

### Clinical Features
The clinical presentation varies, but it is generally less severe than [[Gout]].

*   **Site:** Larger joints are more commonly affected.
    *   **[[Knee joint]]:** Most common site (approx. 50% of cases).
    *   **Other sites:** [[Wrist]], [[shoulder]], [[elbow]], and [[ankle]].
*   **Acute Pseudogout:**
    *   Sudden onset of pain, swelling, warmth, and stiffness.
    *   Redness (erythema) may be present.
    *   Often precipitated by trauma, surgery, or severe medical illness.
*   **Chronic CPPD:**
    *   Can mimic [[Osteoarthritis]] (pseudo-osteoarthritis) or [[Rheumatoid arthritis]] (pseudo-rheumatoid).
    *   Chronic pain and stiffness with superimposed acute attacks.

### Diagnostic Investigations

#### 1. Synovial Fluid Analysis (Gold Standard)
Aspiration of the joint fluid is crucial to differentiate from septic arthritis and gout.

| Feature | [[Gout]] | [[Pseudogout]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Crystal Composition** | [[Monosodium Urate]] | [[Calcium Pyrophosphate]] |
| **Shape** | Needle-shaped | Rhomboid / Rectangular |
| **Birefringence** (Polarized Light) | Strongly Negative | Weakly Positive |

#### 2. Radiology (X-rays)
*   **[[Chondrocalcinosis]]:** Calcification of the articular cartilage or fibrocartilage.
*   **Knee:** Linear calcification of the **[[meniscus]]** is a hallmark finding.
*   **Wrist:** Calcification of the [[triangular fibrocartilage complex]] (TFCC).
*   **Joint Damage:** In chronic stages, features of degenerative arthritis (joint space narrowing, sclerosis) may be seen, often in joints not typically affected by primary OA (e.g., wrist, elbow).

### Differential Diagnosis
It is essential to distinguish Pseudogout from:
*   **[[Gout]]:** Typically affects the 1st MTP joint (Podagra); crystals are urate.
*   **[[Septic Arthritis]]:** High fever, severe spasm, positive culture; strictly rule out if the joint is hot and red.
*   **[[Osteoarthritis]]:** Chronic pain, osteophytes, no crystals.
*   **[[Rheumatoid Arthritis]]:** Symmetrical, small joints, RF positive.

### Treatment
The management focuses on symptom relief and handling acute attacks. There is no specific therapy to remove crystal deposits.

#### Acute Attacks
1.  **[[NSAIDs]]:** First-line treatment (e.g., Indomethacin, Naproxen) to reduce pain and inflammation.
2.  **Joint Aspiration:** Removing the effusion reduces intra-articular pressure and removes crystals/inflammatory cells, providing significant relief.
3.  **Intra-articular Corticosteroids:** Injection of steroids (e.g., methylprednisolone) into the joint after aspiration is highly effective,.
4.  **Rest and Ice:** Supportive care (RICE protocol).
5.  **Colchicine:** Can be used for acute attacks (though less effective than in gout) and for prophylaxis in frequent recurrences.

#### Chronic Management
*   Treat the underlying metabolic cause (e.g., [[Hyperparathyroidism]]) if present.
*   Management of secondary [[Osteoarthritis]] if joint damage has occurred.
