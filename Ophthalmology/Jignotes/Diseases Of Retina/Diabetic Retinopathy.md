# [[Diseases Of Retina]] > Diabetic Retinopathy

# [[Diabetic Retinopathy]] (DR)

**Diabetic Retinopathy** is a specific microangiopathy affecting the retinal precapillary arterioles, capillaries, and venules, occurring as a chronic complication of [[Diabetes Mellitus]] (DM). It is a leading cause of blindness.

### Risk Factors
*   **Duration of Diabetes:** Most important factor.
    *   Type 1: 20% after 10 years, 90% after 20 years.
    *   Type 2: 25% after 10 years, 60% after 20 years.
*   **Poor Metabolic Control:** High HbA1c.
*   **Systemic Factors:** [[Hypertension]], [[Anemia]], [[Nephropathy]], [[Dyslipidemia]], Smoking, Pregnancy.

### Pathogenesis
1.  **Microangiopathy:** Loss of intramural [[pericytes]] (earliest histopathological change) and thickening of capillary basement membrane.
2.  **Capillary Occlusion:** Leads to retinal ischemia $\rightarrow$ release of [[Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor]] (VEGF) $\rightarrow$ [[Neovascularization]].
3.  **Breakdown of Blood-Retinal Barrier:** Leads to leakage of fluid and lipids $\rightarrow$ Retinal edema and [[Hard Exudates]].

### Classification (ETDRS)
The **Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)** classifies the disease into Non-Proliferative (NPDR) and Proliferative (PDR) stages based on severity.

#### 1. Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR)
The disease remains confined to the retina. There is **no** neovascularization.

| Severity | Definition/Features |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mild NPDR** | At least one [[Microaneurysm]] present. No other lesions. |
| **Moderate NPDR** | Microaneurysms and/or intraretinal hemorrhages in 2–3 quadrants. Mild [[IRMA]] (Intraretinal Microvascular Abnormalities). Cotton wool spots or hard exudates may be present. |
| **Severe NPDR** | Defined by the **4-2-1 Rule** (Any **ONE** of the following):<br>1. Severe hemorrhages in all **4** quadrants.<br>2. Venous beading in **2** or more quadrants.<br>3. Moderate IRMA in at least **1** quadrant. |
| **Very Severe NPDR** | Any **TWO** or more criteria of the 4-2-1 rule are met. |

**Clinical Signs of NPDR:**
*   **[[Microaneurysms]]:** Earliest clinically visible sign. Small red dots (outpouching of capillary walls).
*   **[[Dot and Blot Hemorrhages]]:** Deep hemorrhages in the inner nuclear layer.
*   **[[Hard Exudates]]:** Yellowish waxy lipid deposits in the outer plexiform layer (often arranged in circinate pattern).
*   **[[Cotton Wool Spots]] (Soft Exudates):** Fluffy white lesions representing nerve fiber layer infarcts (sign of ischemia).
*   **Venous Changes:** Beading, looping, and sausage-like segmentation.
*   **[[IRMA]]:** Fine, irregular red lines connecting arterioles to venules (shunts) bypassing capillary bed.

#### 2. Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR)
Characterized by the development of **[[Neovascularization]]** (new vessels) due to severe ischemia. These vessels are fragile and lack pericytes.

*   **NVD (Neovascularization of Disc):** New vessels at the optic disc or within 1 disc diameter.
*   **NVE (Neovascularization Elsewhere):** New vessels anywhere else on the retina (usually along temporal arcades).

**High-Risk PDR (HRC):** Defined by Diabetic Retinopathy Study (DRS) as eyes at high risk for severe visual loss. Criteria:
1.  **NVD** $\ge$ 1/4 to 1/3 disc area.
2.  **Any NVD** associated with vitreous hemorrhage (VH) or preretinal hemorrhage.
3.  **NVE** $\ge$ 1/2 disc area associated with VH or preretinal hemorrhage.

**Advanced Diabetic Eye Disease (ADED):**
End-stage complications of PDR:
*   Persistent [[Vitreous Hemorrhage]].
*   Tractional [[Retinal Detachment]] (TRD).
*   [[Neovascular Glaucoma]] (Rubeosis Iridis).

### Comparison: NPDR vs. PDR

| Feature | NPDR (Non-Proliferative) | PDR (Proliferative) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Key Pathology** | Microvascular leakage and occlusion. | Neovascularization (proliferation of new vessels). |
| **New Vessels** | Absent. | Present (NVD or NVE). |
| **Internal Limiting Membrane** | Intact. | Breached by new vessels growing into vitreous. |
| **Primary Visual Threat** | [[Diabetic Macular Edema]] (DME). | Vitreous Hemorrhage and Tractional RD. |
| **Management** | Observation / Focal Laser / Anti-VEGF (if DME). | Panretinal Photocoagulation (PRP) / Anti-VEGF / Surgery. |

### Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)
Can occur at **any stage** (NPDR or PDR). It is the most common cause of moderate visual loss.

**Clinically Significant Macular Edema (CSME)**
Defined by ETDRS as any one of the following:
1.  Retinal thickening at or within **500 $\mu$m** of the center of fovea.
2.  [[Hard exudates]] at or within **500 $\mu$m** of foveal center, *if* associated with adjacent thickening.
3.  Retinal thickening of **1 disc diameter** (1500 $\mu$m) or larger, if any part is within 1 disc diameter of foveal center.

*Clinical Implication:* CSME requires treatment (Laser/Anti-VEGF) regardless of visual acuity.

### Screening Schedule
*   **Type 1 DM:** 5 years after onset (rare before puberty).
*   **Type 2 DM:** At the time of diagnosis (as onset is insidious).
*   **Pregnancy (diabetic):** First trimester and then every 3 months.

---

### Management

#### 1. Systemic Management
*   Strict glycemic control (HbA1c < 7%).
*   Control of [[Hypertension]] and [[Hyperlipidemia]].
*   Lifestyle modification (Stop smoking).

#### 2. Ocular Management

**A. For NPDR:**
*   **Mild/Moderate:** Periodic follow-up.
*   **Severe/Very Severe:** Close monitoring. Consider PRP if follow-up is poor, before cataract surgery, or in pregnancy.

**B. For PDR:**
*   **[[Panretinal Photocoagulation]] (PRP):** Gold standard. 1200–1600 laser burns applied to peripheral retina to destroy ischemic retina and reduce VEGF load.
*   **Anti-VEGF Agents:** (e.g., Bevacizumab, Ranibizumab, Aflibercept). Used as adjunct or alternative to PRP.

**C. For Diabetic Macular Edema (DME):**
*   **Intravitreal Anti-VEGF:** First-line treatment for center-involving DME.
*   **Intravitreal Steroids:** (e.g., Triamcinolone, Ozurdex implant) for refractory cases.
*   **Focal/Grid Laser:** For non-center involving DME or focal leaks.

**D. Surgical (Pars Plana Vitrectomy):**
Indications:
*   Non-clearing [[Vitreous Hemorrhage]] (> 1 month in Type 1, > 3 months in Type 2).
*   Tractional [[Retinal Detachment]] threatening macula.
*   Combined Tractional and Rhegmatogenous RD.
