# [[Diseases Of Uveal Tract]] > Choroidal Degeneration

### Classification of Choroidal Degenerations

Degenerative conditions of the choroid are more frequent and important in the posterior uvea. They are broadly classified into two categories:

1.  **Primary Choroidal Degenerations:** Localized or generalized hereditary dystrophies or age-related changes.
2.  **Secondary Choroidal Degenerations:** Post-inflammatory changes.

### I. Primary Choroidal Degenerations

These conditions often present with progressive loss of vision (night blindness or central vision loss) and characteristic fundus changes.

#### 1. Essential Gyrate Atrophy
A rare, hereditary, metabolic disorder affecting the choroid and retina.

*   **Etiology:** Inborn error of amino acid metabolism due to deficiency of the mitochondrial matrix enzyme **[[Ornithine Ketoacid Aminotransferase]] (OAT)**.
    *   leads to **Hyperornithinaemia** (increased ornithine in plasma, urine, CSF, and aqueous humor).
*   **Inheritance:** [[Autosomal Recessive]].
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Onset:** First decade of life.
    *   **Symptoms:** Night blindness ([[Nyctalopia]]) is the prominent symptom.
    *   **Fundus Appearance:**
        *   Starts as **scalloped circular patches** of chorioretinal atrophy in the retinal periphery.
        *   Lesions coalesce and progress towards the posterior pole.
        *   **End Stage:** Almost the entire [[Choriocapillaris]] and [[Retinal Pigment Epithelium]] (RPE) disappear. The fundus appears white (sclera visible) with only the macula preserved until very late.
        *   Fine, velvet-like pigmentation may be seen.
*   **Associated Ocular Features:**
    *   High [[Axial Myopia]].
    *   Posterior Subcapsular [[Cataract]].
*   **Investigations:**
    *   **ERG (Electroretinogram):** Non-recordable or severely reduced.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **[[Pyridoxine]] (Vitamin B6):** Some patients are B6-responsive and show better prognosis.
    *   **Diet:** Low protein diet with **Arginine restriction** (as ornithine is synthesized from arginine).

#### 2. Choroideremia
A hereditary degeneration primarily affecting males.

*   **Inheritance:** [[X-linked Recessive]] (Affects males; females are carriers).
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Onset:** First decade of life.
    *   **Symptoms:** Progressive **Night Blindness**.
    *   **Fundus Appearance:**
        *   Initially manifests as diffuse **mottled depigmentation** of the RPE.
        *   Progresses to fine whitish patches of atrophy in the mid-retinal zone.
        *   **Late Stage:** Almost total disappearance of choroidal tissue and RPE. The fundus shows **bare white sclera** traversed by normal retinal vessels (unlike Retinitis Pigmentosa where vessels are attenuated).
*   **Investigations:**
    *   **ERG:** Scotopic ERG is non-recordable.

#### 3. Central Areolar Choroidal Dystrophy (CACD)
Also known as Central Areolar Choroidal Atrophy (Sclerosis).

*   **Etiology:** Genetically determined (usually Autosomal Dominant).
*   **Onset:** Between 20 and 40 years of age.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Loss of **central vision** and defective color vision.
    *   **Fundus Appearance:** Bilateral, punched-out, circular/oval atrophic lesion at the [[Macula]].
    *   **Characteristic Sign:** The lesion shows white shining sclera traversed by large, **ribbon-like choroidal vessels** (due to atrophy of choriocapillaris and RPE).
*   **Investigations:**
    *   **FFA:** Shows intense fluorescence in the area of atrophy.

#### 4. Senile Central Choroidal Atrophy
*   **Subtypes:**
    1.  **Central Guttate Choroidal Atrophy (Tay's Choroiditis):**
        *   Characterized by numerous minute yellowish-white spots (**[[Drusen]]** or colloid bodies) in the macular region.
        *   These are hyaline excrescences on [[Bruch's Membrane]].
    2.  **Central Areolar Choroidal Atrophy:** (As described above, may present as a senile change).

#### 5. Myopic Chorioretinal Degeneration
Occurs in **[[Pathological Myopia]]** (High myopia > -6D) due to excessive axial elongation of the eyeball. It is not inflammatory but degenerative.

*   **Fundus Changes:**
    *   **[[Temporal Myopic Crescent]]:** White crescent at the temporal border of the disc due to choroidal atrophy exposing the sclera.
    *   **[[Posterior Staphyloma]]:** Ectasia of the sclera at the posterior pole; vessels appear to bend backward over the margin.
    *   **[[Tigroid Fundus]]:** Tessellated appearance due to thinning of RPE and visibility of choroidal vessels.
    *   **[[Lacquer Cracks]]:** Linear breaks in Bruch's membrane.
    *   **[[Foster-Fuchs Spot]]:** Dark red/black circular spot at the macula due to subretinal neovascularization and hemorrhage.
*   **Complications:** Retinal Detachment, Complicated Cataract, Vitreous Liquefaction.

---

### II. Secondary Choroidal Degenerations

*   **Definition:** Occurs following inflammatory lesions of the fundus (Post-inflammatory).
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Scattered areas of chorioretinal atrophy.
    *   **[[Pseudoretinitis Pigmentosa]]:** The ophthalmoscopic picture resembles Retinitis Pigmentosa (pigment clumping and atrophy) but lacks the characteristic distribution and genetic history.
    *   Causes include Syphilis (diffuse chorioretinitis).

| Feature | Gyrate Atrophy | Choroideremia | Central Areolar Choroidal Dystrophy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inheritance** | Autosomal Recessive | X-Linked Recessive | Autosomal Dominant (Mostly) |
| **Primary Defect** | Enzyme Deficiency (OAT) | Choroidal/RPE Dystrophy | Choriocapillaris/RPE Atrophy |
| **Biochemistry** | High Ornithine levels | Normal | Normal |
| **Symptoms** | Night Blindness | Night Blindness | Central Vision Loss |
| **Lesion Start** | Mid-periphery (Scalloped) | Mid-periphery (Mottled) | Macula (Central) |
| **Macula** | Spared until late | Spared until late | Affected Early |
| **Retinal Vessels** | Attenuated late | Normal appearance | Normal overlay |
