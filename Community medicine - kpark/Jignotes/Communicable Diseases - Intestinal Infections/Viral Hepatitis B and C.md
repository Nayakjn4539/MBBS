# [[Communicable Diseases - Intestinal Infections]] > Viral Hepatitis B and C

# Viral Hepatitis B and C

*Note: While Hepatitis A and E are intestinal (fecal-oral) infections, Hepatitis B and C are primarily transmitted parenterally and sexually.*

### 1. Hepatitis B (Serum Hepatitis)

**Clinical Relevance:** Hepatitis B is a major global health problem causing chronic liver disease, [[Cirrhosis]], and [[Hepatocellular Carcinoma]] (HCC). It is second only to tobacco as a known human carcinogen.

#### Epidemiological Determinants
*   **Agent Factor:**
    *   **Agent:** [[Hepatitis B Virus]] (HBV). It is a **DNA virus** (Hepadnavirus family),.
    *   **Morphology:** A complex, 42 nm, double-shelled particle known as the **[[Dane Particle]]**.
    *   **Antigens:**
        1.  **HBsAg** (Surface Antigen): [[Australia Antigen]]. First evidence of infection.
        2.  **HBcAg** (Core Antigen): Does not appear alone in serum.
        3.  **HBeAg** (Envelope Antigen): Marker of **active viral replication** and high **infectivity**.
    *   **Resistance:** Very stable; survives at least 7 days on environmental surfaces. Killed by Sodium Hypochlorite or autoclaving.
*   **Reservoir:** **Man** is the only reservoir (Cases and [[Carriers]]). There is no animal reservoir.
*   **Source of Infection:** Contaminated [[Blood]], saliva, vaginal secretions, and semen,.

#### Transmission
*   **Parenteral (Percutaneous):** Contaminated needles, syringes, blood transfusion, dialysis, tattooing, ear piercing.
*   **Perinatal (Vertical):** Mother to child. If mother is **HBeAg positive**, risk of transmission is **90%**; if only **HBsAg positive**, risk is **20%**,.
*   **Sexual:** Unprotected heterosexual or homosexual contact.
*   **Horizontal:** Child-to-child transmission via minor cuts/sores/abrasions.

#### Incubation Period
*   **Range:** 45 to 180 days (Average 60–90 days),.
*   **Median:** < 100 days.

#### Clinical Picture
*   **Acute Hepatitis:** Insidious onset with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, and **jaundice** (dark urine, clay-colored stools).
*   **Chronic Hepatitis:** Persistence of [[HBsAg]] for **> 6 months**. Can lead to Cirrhosis and Liver Cancer.
*   **Carriers:** 5-10% of adults and >90% of infants infected perinatally become chronic carriers,.

#### Laboratory Diagnosis
Diagnosis relies on serological markers:

| Marker | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **HBsAg** (+), **IgM Anti-HBc** (+) | [[Acute Hepatitis B]] |
| **HBsAg** (+), **IgG Anti-HBc** (+) | [[Chronic Hepatitis B]] |
| **HBeAg** (+) | High Infectivity / Active Replication |
| **Anti-HBs** (+) only | Immunity due to **[[Vaccination]]** |
| **Anti-HBs** (+) and **Anti-HBc** (+) | Immunity due to **Past Infection** (Recovery) |
| **IgM Anti-HBc** (+) | Recent Infection (Window period indicator) |

#### Treatment
*   **Acute:** Supportive care (fluids, nutrition). No specific antiviral needed usually.
*   **Chronic:** Long-term suppressive therapy with oral antivirals like **[[Tenofovir]]** or **[[Entecavir]]**. Interferons may be used in specific cases.

#### Prevention and Vaccination
*   **Active Immunization (Vaccine):**
    *   **Type:** Sub-unit vaccine (rDNA yeast-derived) containing HBsAg.
    *   **Schedule (India):** **[[Birth Dose]]** (within 24 hrs) followed by 3 doses at 6, 10, and 14 weeks (under [[Universal Immunization Programme]]),.
    *   **Dose/Route:** 0.5 ml IM (Anterolateral thigh).
    *   **Protective Titer:** Anti-HBs levels $\ge$ 10 mIU/mL.
*   **Passive Immunization:** **[[Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin]] (HBIG)**.
    *   Given within **6 hours** (max 48 hours) of exposure.
    *   Indicated for accidental needle stick injuries and newborns of HBsAg+ mothers.

### 2. Hepatitis C (Post-Transfusion Hepatitis)

**Clinical Relevance:** Major cause of **parenterally transmitted** Non-A, Non-B hepatitis. It is known for high rates of chronicity ("Silent Epidemic").

#### Epidemiological Determinants
*   **Agent:** [[Hepatitis C Virus]] (HCV). It is an **RNA virus** (Flavivirus family, genus Hepacivirus),.
*   **Genotypes:** Multiple genotypes exist; Type 3 is common in India.
*   **Reservoir:** Man.

#### Transmission
*   **Parenteral:** Most common route. Injection drug use, blood transfusion (before screening was mandatory), unsafe injections.
*   **Sexual & Perinatal:** Possible but much less efficient than Hepatitis B,.

#### Incubation Period
*   **Range:** 15 to 160 days (Average 6–9 weeks),.

#### Clinical Picture
*   **Acute:** Often asymptomatic or mild. Jaundice is less common than in Hep B.
*   **Chronic:** **50–80%** of infected persons develop chronic infection.
*   **Complications:** High risk of [[Cirrhosis]] and [[Hepatocellular Carcinoma]] (HCC) over 20–30 years.

#### Diagnosis
1.  **Screening:** **[[Anti-HCV Antibody]]** test (ELISA/Rapid).
    *   *Note:* Antibodies do not distinguish between acute, chronic, or resolved infection.
2.  **Confirmation:** **[[HCV RNA]]** (PCR) to detect active viremia.

#### Treatment
*   Revolutionized by **[[Direct Acting Antivirals]] (DAAs)**.
*   Regimens include **Sofosbuvir**, Daclatasvir, Ledipasvir.
*   Treatment duration is usually 12 weeks with a high cure rate (>95%).

#### Prevention
*   **Vaccine:** **NO VACCINE** is available for Hepatitis C.
*   **Measures:**
    *   Screening of all donated blood (Mandatory).
    *   Safe injection practices and harm reduction in IV drug users.
    *   Strict sterilization of surgical/dental instruments.

### Comparison Mnemonic: "The Vowels and Consonants"

*   **Vowels (Type A & E):**
    *   Transmitted by **Bowel** (Fecal-oral).
    *   Generally acute, self-limiting.
    *   No chronic carrier state.
*   **Consonants (Type B, C, D):**
    *   Transmitted by **Blood** / Body fluids.
    *   Can become **Chronic**.
    *   Can cause **Cancer** (HCC).
