# [[Nose]] > Nasal polyps

### **Definition**
[[Nasal Polyps]] are non-neoplastic, edematous masses of the sinonasal mucosa. They appear as pale, smooth, glistening, grape-like structures. They are essentially "skin in the wrong place" inside the nasal cavity. They are classified as a subgroup of [[Chronic Rhinosinusitis]] (CRSwNP).

### **Pathogenesis**
The exact mechanism is complex and multifactorial, but **Bernoulli's Phenomenon** is a widely accepted theory.
*   **Mechanism:** Air passing through a constricted area (like the nasal valve or middle meatus) attains high velocity.
*   **Result:** This creates a negative pressure (suction effect) in the vicinity.
*   **Consequence:** The negative pressure sucks the edematous mucosa of the sinuses into the nasal cavity, leading to polyp formation.
*   **Histopathology:** The lining is usually **ciliated columnar epithelium** (respiratory epithelium) which may undergo squamous metaplasia due to atmospheric irritation. The submucosa shows large intercellular spaces filled with serous fluid and infiltration with **eosinophils** (allergic) or neutrophils (infective).

### **Classification of Nasal Polyps**
There are two main types of nasal polyps:
1.  **Bilateral Ethmoidal Polyps** (Most common)
2.  **Antrochoanal Polyp** (Killian’s Polyp)

#### **Difference Between Antrochoanal and Ethmoidal Polyps**
| Feature | **Antrochoanal Polyp** | **Ethmoidal Polyps** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Origin** | Maxillary antrum (near accessory ostium) | Ethmoidal labyrinth (uncinate process, middle meatus) |
| **Number** | Solitary | Multiple |
| **Laterality** | Unilateral | Bilateral |
| **Age Group** | Children and Young Adults | Adults |
| **Etiology** | Infection | Allergy, Multifactorial, Systemic diseases |
| **Growth** | Grows posteriorly to choana/nasopharynx | Grows anteriorly |
| **Shape** | Trilobed (Antral, Nasal, Choanal parts) | Grape-like masses |
| **Recurrence** | Uncommon if removed completely | Common |
| **Treatment** | [[FESS]] (Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery) | Medical (Steroids) + FESS |

### **Bilateral Ethmoidal Polyps**

#### **Etiology and Associations**
Bilateral polyps in adults or children are often associated with systemic conditions:
1.  **Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS):** Both allergic and non-allergic.
2.  **Asthma:** 7% of asthmatics have polyps.
3.  **Aspirin Intolerance (Samter’s Triad):**
    *   **Mnemonic:** **ASA**
        *   **A**spirin Sensitivity
        *   **S**inus Polyps (Nasal Polyps)
        *   **A**sthma
4.  **[[Cystic Fibrosis]]:** Common in children. Caused by abnormal chloride conductance leading to thick mucus. *Clinical Implication:* Any child with bilateral polyps must be investigated for Cystic Fibrosis (Sweat chloride test >70 mEq/L).
5.  **Allergic Fungal Sinusitis ([[AFRS]]):** Characterized by eosinophilic mucin and fungal debris.
6.  **Kartagener’s Syndrome:** Triad of Bronchiectasis + Sinusitis + Situs Inversus (due to ciliary dyskinesis).
7.  **Young’s Syndrome:** Sinopulmonary disease + Azoospermia.
8.  **Churg-Strauss Syndrome:** Asthma + Eosinophilia + Vasculitis + Granuloma.

#### **Clinical Features**
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Nasal obstruction (paradoxical or total).
    *   Anosmia or Hyposmia (loss of smell).
    *   Rhinorrhea (watery if allergic, purulent if infected).
    *   Headache (due to associated sinusitis).
    *   "Frog Face" deformity: Widening of intercanthal distance in long-standing cases.
*   **Signs (Anterior Rhinoscopy):**
    *   Multiple, smooth, glistening, pale/greyish masses.
    *   Insensitive to touch.
    *   **Do not bleed on touch**.

### **Antrochoanal Polyp (ACP)**

#### **Anatomy of ACP**
It arises from the mucosa of the [[Maxillary Sinus]], exits through the accessory ostium, and grows backwards. It has **3 parts**:
1.  **Antral:** Thin stalk origin.
2.  **Nasal:** Flat from side to side (compressed in nasal cavity).
3.  **Choanal:** Round/globular (grows freely in nasopharynx).

#### **Clinical Features**
*   **Unilateral Nasal Obstruction:** This is the presenting symptom. It acts like a ball-valve, causing obstruction during expiration.
*   **Bilateral Obstruction:** Can occur if the polyp grows huge and obstructs the nasopharynx completely.
*   **Voice:** Hyponasal speech (Rhinolalia clausa).
*   **Signs:**
    *   May be missed on anterior rhinoscopy if situated posteriorly.
    *   On posterior rhinoscopy: A globular mass filling the choana.
    *   Can hang down behind the soft palate into the oropharynx.

### **Diagnosis and Investigations**

#### **1. Clinical Tests**
*   **Probe Test:** Used to differentiate a polyp from a hypertrophied turbinate or [[Concha Bullosa]].
    *   **Polyp:** Pale, Soft, Insensitive to touch, Does not bleed, Probe can be passed all around it.
    *   **Turbinate:** Pink, Hard (bone), Sensitive/Painful, Bleeds on touch, Probe cannot be passed all around (attached laterally).

#### **2. Nasal Endoscopy (DNE)**
*   **Gold Standard** for visualization.
*   Confirms site of origin (middle meatus for ethmoidal, accessory ostium for ACP).
*   Visualizes mucopurulent discharge or fungal debris (peanut butter appearance in AFRS).

#### **3. Imaging (CT Scan - NCCT)**
*   **Ethmoidal Polyps:** Shows extent of disease, bony erosions, and status of lamina papyracea.
    *   **Double Density Sign:** Seen in Allergic Fungal Sinusitis (heterogeneous opacities due to heavy metals in fungi).
*   **Antrochoanal Polyp:**
    *   Shows mass filling the maxillary antrum and extending into the choana.
    *   **Dodd’s Sign (Crescent Sign):** On lateral X-ray/CT, a crescent of air is seen between the polyp and the posterior pharyngeal wall (differentiates from [[Angiofibroma]] which arises from the wall itself).

#### **4. Histopathology**
*   Mandatory to rule out malignancy (inverted papilloma, squamous cell carcinoma) or granulomatous diseases.

### **Differential Diagnosis**
| Condition | Differentiating Feature |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Meningoencephalocele]]** | Seen in infants/newborns. Pulsatile. **Furstenberg test +ve** (mass expands on crying/jugular compression). Do not biopsy!. |
| **[[Angiofibroma]]** | Adolescent males. Profuse, recurrent epistaxis. Contrast CT shows vascularity. |
| **[[Inverted Papilloma]]** | Unilateral, elderly, friable, bleeds on touch. Originates from lateral wall. Premalignant. |
| **Hypertrophied Turbinate** | Sensitive, bony hard, does not move freely. |

### **Management**

#### **1. Medical Management**
Primarily for **Ethmoidal Polyps** (small/moderate size):
*   **Systemic Steroids:** Short course (e.g., Prednisolone) to reduce size ("medical polypectomy").
*   **Topical Steroids:** Nasal sprays (Mometasone, Fluticasone) for maintenance and to prevent recurrence.
*   **Antihistamines:** If allergy is present.
*   **Antibiotics:** For superimposed bacterial infection.

#### **2. Surgical Management**
Indicated for Antrochoanal polyps (always surgical) and Ethmoidal polyps refractory to medical therapy.
*   **[[FESS]] (Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery):** Treatment of choice.
    *   **Concept:** Removal of polyps and opening of sinus ostia to restore ventilation and drainage while preserving normal mucosa.
    *   For ACP: The antral part must be removed completely to prevent recurrence.
*   **Polypectomy:** Simple removal using a snare (obsolete for multiple polyps).
*   **Caldwell-Luc Operation:** Rarely used now; reserved for recurrent Antrochoanal polyps where FESS fails to clear the antral portion.

#### **3. Post-Operative Care**
*   Saline douching.
*   Steroid nasal sprays to prevent recurrence.
