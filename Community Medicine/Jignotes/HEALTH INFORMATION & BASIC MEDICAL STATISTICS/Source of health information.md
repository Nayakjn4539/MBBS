# [[HEALTH INFORMATION & BASIC MEDICAL STATISTICS]] > Source of health information

### Sources of Health Information

A [[Health Information System]] is a mechanism for the collection, processing, analysis, and transmission of information required for organizing and operating health services, and also for research and training. The information requirements vary according to the level of administration (e.g., PHC vs. Ministry of Health).

The primary sources of health information are listed below:

#### 1. Census
The census is an important source of health information, taken in most countries at regular intervals, usually of **10 years**.
*   **Definition:** It is the total process of collecting, compiling, and publishing demographic, economic, and social data pertaining to all persons in a country at a specified time.
*   **Method:** India follows the **de jure** method (counting people where they normally reside) rather than the de facto method (where they are present on census night).
*   **Uses:**
    *   Provides the **denominator** for calculating vital rates (Birth rate, Death rate).
    *   Provides information on age, sex, literacy, and population density.
*   **Current Status:** The first regular census in India was taken in 1881. The last census was held in **2011**. The census moment (Census Stop) in India is 00:00 hours on 1st March of the census year.

#### 2. Registration of Vital Events (Civil Registration System)
This refers to the legal registration, statistical recording, and reporting of vital events like [[Live Births]], [[Deaths]], Fetal deaths, and Marriages.
*   **Legal Basis:** In India, this is governed by the **Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969**.
*   **Time Limit:** Births and deaths must be registered within **21 days** of occurrence.
*   **Limitation:** In many developing countries (including parts of India), civil registration is incomplete and inaccurate due to illiteracy and lack of motivation.

#### 3. Sample Registration System (SRS)
Due to the deficiency in the Civil Registration System, the SRS was initiated to provide reliable estimates of birth and death rates at the National and State levels.
*   **Methodology:** It is a **[[Dual Record System]]** consisting of:
    1.  **Continuous enumeration** by a resident part-time enumerator.
    2.  **Independent retrospective survey** every 6 months by a supervisor.
*   **Significance:** Currently, SRS is the most reliable source of information for **Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)**, Birth Rate, and Death Rate in India.

#### 4. Notification of Diseases
*   **Purpose:** To provide early warning of outbreaks and enable immediate control measures.
*   **Notifiable Diseases:**
    *   **International Health Regulations (IHR):** Cholera, Plague, Yellow Fever.
    *   **Local/National:** Diseases like Polio, Malaria, Rabies, and HIV are often notified.
*   **Limitation:** Suffering from the **"Iceberg Phenomenon"**; only a small fraction of cases (the tip) are notified, while the majority remain hidden.

#### 5. Hospital Records
*   **Type of Data:** Provides information on morbidity (illness), diagnosis, length of stay, and outcome (recovery/death).
*   **Limitations:**
    *   **Selection Bias (Berksonian Bias):** Hospital patients do not represent the general population (only sick people who seek care are counted).
    *   Lack of a defined population base (denominator is unknown).

#### 6. Disease Registers
A register implies a permanent record established for follow-up and statistical analysis of survival.
*   **Common Registers:** [[Cancer Registry]], Stroke, Myocardial Infarction, Blindness, and congenital defects.
*   **Utility:** Provides data on the natural history of chronic diseases and survival rates.

#### 7. Epidemiological Surveillance
In endemic countries, specific control programs maintain surveillance systems.
*   **Examples:** [[National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme]] (Malaria), [[Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme]] (RNTCP), and HIV Sentinel Surveillance.
*   **Sentinel Surveillance:** Identifying missing cases and supplementing notified cases by using specific sites (e.g., ANC clinics for HIV).

#### 8. Population Surveys
Surveys supplement routine statistics by collecting data on parameters not usually recorded (e.g., health behavior, utilization of services).
*   **Types:**
    *   **Health Interview Survey:** Face-to-face (e.g., NSSO).
    *   **Health Examination Survey:** Includes clinical/lab tests.
*   **Major Surveys in India:**
    *   **[[National Family Health Survey (NFHS)]]:** Provides essential data on fertility, family planning, mortality, and maternal/child health.
    *   **District Level Household Survey (DLHS):** Reproductive and child health data.

#### 9. Other Health Service Records
*   Records from PHCs, Sub-centers, MCH centers, and School health records.
*   Provides data on growth monitoring, immunization coverage, and antenatal care.

#### 10. Environmental Health Data
*   Statistics related to housing, water supply, air pollution, and noise levels. This is crucial for studying the relationship between environment and health.

#### 11. Health Manpower Statistics
*   Records of physicians, nurses, dentists, and pharmacists maintained by state councils and directorates.
