### Rheumatoid Arthritis: Diagnostic Criteria and Deformities

[[Rheumatoid arthritis]] (RA) is a chronic, systemic, autoimmune disease characterized by symmetrical, erosive [[polyarthritis]]. It primarily affects the [[synovium]], leading to the formation of [[pannus]] (vascular granulation tissue), which destroys articular cartilage and subchondral bone.

---

### Diagnostic Criteria

Diagnosis is based on clinical guidelines established by the **American College of Rheumatology (ACR)** and **EULAR**. Two sets of criteria are commonly referenced: the traditional 1987 criteria and the updated 2010 classification criteria.

#### 1. 1987 Revised ACR Criteria
To classify a patient as having RA, at least **4 out of the following 7 criteria** must be present. Criteria 1 through 4 must have been present for at least **6 weeks**.

| Criteria | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Morning Stiffness** | Stiffness in and around joints lasting at least **1 hour** before maximal improvement. |
| **2. Arthritis of > 3 Joint Areas** | Soft tissue swelling or fluid observed by a physician in at least 3 joint areas simultaneously (PIP, MCP, wrist, elbow, knee, ankle, MTP). |
| **3. Arthritis of Hand Joints** | Swelling specifically involving the [[wrist]], [[metacarpophalangeal joint]] (MCP), or [[proximal interphalangeal joint]] (PIP). |
| **4. Symmetrical Arthritis** | Simultaneous involvement of the same joint areas on both sides of the body. |
| **5. Rheumatoid Nodules** | Subcutaneous nodules over bony prominences, extensor surfaces, or juxta-articular regions. |
| **6. Rheumatoid Factor (RF)** | Demonstration of abnormal amounts of serum [[Rheumatoid Factor]]. |
| **7. Radiographic Changes** | Typical changes on PA hand/wrist X-rays: erosions or unequivocal bony decalcification (juxta-articular osteopenia). |

> **Clinical Implication:** While useful, the 1987 criteria often fail to identify early disease. The 2010 criteria focus on earlier diagnosis to initiate [[Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs]] (DMARDs) sooner.

#### 2. 2010 ACR/EULAR Classification Criteria
A score of **$\ge$ 6 out of 10** is needed for definitive classification of RA.

| Domain | Categories | Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Joint Involvement** | 1 large joint | 0 |
| | 2–10 large joints | 1 |
| | 1–3 small joints (with or without large joints) | 2 |
| | 4–10 small joints (with or without large joints) | 3 |
| | > 10 joints (at least 1 small joint) | 5 |
| **Serology** | Negative [[Rheumatoid Factor]] (RF) and negative [[Anti-CCP]] | 0 |
| | Low-positive RF or low-positive Anti-CCP | 2 |
| | High-positive RF or high-positive Anti-CCP | 3 |
| **Acute Phase Reactants** | Normal [[C-reactive protein]] (CRP) and [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] (ESR) | 0 |
| | Abnormal CRP or abnormal ESR | 1 |
| **Duration of Symptoms** | < 6 weeks | 0 |
| | $\ge$ 6 weeks | 1 |

*   **Large Joints:** Shoulder, elbow, hip, knee, ankle.
*   **Small Joints:** MCP, PIP, MTP (2-5), thumb IP, wrist.

### Deformities in Rheumatoid Arthritis

Deformities result from the destruction of cartilage, bone, ligaments, and tendons (due to [[synovitis]] and [[pannus]]), combined with muscle spasm and imbalance.

#### 1. Hand and Wrist Deformities
The hand is the most commonly affected region ("Rheumatoid Hand").

| Deformity | Description & Pathology |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Ulnar Drift (Deviation)** | Medial deviation of the fingers at the [[metacarpophalangeal joint]] (MCP). The carpus often shifts radially. |
| **Swan Neck Deformity** | **Hyperextension** of the PIP joint and **Flexion** of the DIP joint. Due to intrinsic muscle tightness and laxity of the volar plate. |
| **Boutonniere Deformity** | **Flexion** of the PIP joint and **Hyperextension** of the DIP joint. Caused by rupture or attenuation of the central slip of the extensor tendon (extensor hood). |
| **Z-Deformity of Thumb** | Flexion at the MCP joint and hyperextension at the [[interphalangeal joint]] (IP). Also called "Hitchhiker's thumb". |
| **Piano Key Sign** | Prominence of the ulnar head (caput ulnae) due to dorsal subluxation of the distal ulna. The ulnar head can be depressed like a piano key but springs back (ballottement). |
| **Trigger Finger** | Locking of the finger in flexion due to synovial nodules on the flexor tendons blocking the pulley system. |

#### 2. Knee Deformities
The knee is involved in 80% of established RA cases.

*   **Early Stage:** Loss of full extension (flexion deformity) due to hamstring spasm and effusion.
*   **Late Stage (Triple Deformity):** A classic and disabling deformity characterized by:
    1.  **Flexion**
    2.  **Posterior Subluxation** (of the tibia on the femur)
    3.  **External Rotation** (of the tibia)
*   **Valgus Deformity:** Knock-knees are common due to lateral compartment erosion.

#### 3. Foot and Ankle Deformities
*   **Hallux Valgus:** Lateral deviation of the great toe at the MTP joint.
*   **Hammer Toes:** Flexion deformity of the PIP joints of the lesser toes.
*   **Cock-up Deformity:** Dorsal subluxation of the MTP heads (metatarsalgia) with clawing of toes. The metatarsal heads become prominent on the sole, causing painful callosities.
*   **Winswept Deformity:** Valgus deformity of one foot and varus deformity of the other (or similar drift of toes).
*   **Hindfoot Valgus:** Due to subtalar joint involvement.

#### 4. Spine Deformities (Cervical Spine)
RA typically affects the upper cervical spine.
*   **Atlanto-axial Subluxation:** Instability at C1-C2 due to destruction of the [[transverse ligament]] and erosion of the [[odontoid process]].
*   **Basilar Invagination:** Superior migration of the odontoid into the foramen magnum.
*   **Subaxial Subluxation:** Step-ladder deformity at lower cervical levels (C3-C7).

> **Clinical Implication:** Always perform flexion-extension X-rays of the cervical spine in RA patients before any surgery requiring intubation to rule out C1-C2 instability, which can cause spinal cord compression.
