# [[ENVIRONMENT & HEALTH]] > Overcrowding is a health hazard

### Overcrowding as a Health Hazard

**Definition**
[[Overcrowding]] refers to the situation in which more people are living within a single dwelling than there is space for, such that movement is restricted, privacy is secluded, hygiene is impossible, and rest and sleep are difficult.

It is a health stressor leading to physical, mental, and social health problems.

### Criteria for Overcrowding
Overcrowding is technically defined based on three specific standards. If **any one** of these criteria is violated, the house is considered overcrowded.

**1. Persons Per Room**
The degree of overcrowding is often expressed as the number of persons per room. The accepted standards are:

| Number of Rooms | Maximum Number of Persons |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 Room | 2 persons |
| 2 Rooms | 3 persons |
| 3 Rooms | 5 persons |
| 4 Rooms | 7 persons |
| 5 or more Rooms | 10 persons (add 2 for each further room) |

**

**2. Floor Space Per Person**
This criterion is based on the available floor area per person.

| Floor Area (Square Feet) | Maximum Number of Persons |
| :--- | :--- |
| 110 sq. ft or more | 2 persons |
| 90 – 100 sq. ft | 1 ½ persons |
| 70 – 90 sq. ft | 1 person |
| 50 – 70 sq. ft | ½ person |
| Under 50 sq. ft | Nil |

**Note:**
*   A baby under **12 months** is not counted.
*   Children between **1 to 10 years** are counted as **½ unit**.

**3. Sex Separation**
Overcrowding is considered to exist if **2 persons over 9 years of age**, not husband and wife, of opposite sexes are obliged to sleep in the same room.

### Health Hazards of Overcrowding
Overcrowding affects the [[Physical Environment]], biological environment, and psychosocial environment of the individual.

**1. Respiratory Infections**
Close proximity increases the transmission of airborne droplet infections.
*   Common cold, Influenza, [[Tuberculosis]].
*   Diphtheria, Measles, Whooping cough, Bronchitis.

**2. Skin Infections**
Direct contact and lack of hygiene lead to rapid spread.
*   [[Scabies]], Ringworm, Impetigo, Leprosy.

**3. Arthropod and Rodent Infestation**
*   Increased prevalence of Houseflies, Mosquitoes, Fleas, and Bugs.
*   Rat infestation leading to Plague.

**4. Accidents**
A substantial proportion of home accidents occur due to congestion and defects in the home environment.

**5. Psychosocial Effects**
Lack of privacy and personal space leads to:
*   Irritability, frustration, and anxiety.
*   Lack of sleep and rest.
*   Mental disorders and violent behavior.
*   Growth of slums and squatter settlements leads to social isolation and neurosis.

**6. Increased Morbidity and Mortality**
High [[Morbidity]] and mortality rates (especially infant and maternal mortality) are observed where housing conditions are sub-standard.

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Tuberculosis Control:** In [[RNTCP]]/NTEP, history of overcrowding is a crucial risk factor. Latent TB converts to active TB more frequently in overcrowded, ill-ventilated slums.
*   **Scabies Outbreaks:** Often seen in hostels, barracks, or large families living in single rooms due to sharing of bedding and close contact.

### Mnemonic
**"CRAMPED"** to remember hazards of Overcrowding:
*   **C**ommunicable diseases (TB, Measles)
*   **R**espiratory infections
*   **A**ccidents (Domestic)
*   **M**ental stress / Morbidity high
*   **P**rivacy lack / Psychosocial issues
*   **E**ctoparasites (Scabies, Lice)
*   **D**eaths (High Mortality)

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> create a simple floor plan diagram showing a single room with measurements (e.g., 80 sq ft) and placing 3 adults inside to visually demonstrate the violation of 'Floor Space' and 'Persons per Room' criteria
