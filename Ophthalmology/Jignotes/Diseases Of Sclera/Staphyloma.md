# Staphyloma

### Definition
A [[Staphyloma]] is defined as a localized bulging or ectasia of the weak and thin outer tunic of the eyeball (the [[Cornea]] or [[Sclera]]), which is lined by [[Uveal tissue]]. The uveal tissue shines through the thinned-out fibrous coat, giving it a characteristic appearance.

### Etiopathogenesis
The basic underlying pathology involves a weakening of the eye wall, which can be caused by various inflammatory or degenerative diseases. This weakening typically renders the eye wall unable to withstand the [[Intraocular Pressure]] (IOP). Consequently, both the structural weakness and the raised IOP contribute to the development of the staphyloma.

### Classification
Staphylomas are classified anatomically based on their location on the globe,,:
1.  **[[Anterior Staphyloma]]**
2.  **[[Intercalary Staphyloma]]**
3.  **[[Ciliary Staphyloma]]**
4.  **[[Equatorial Staphyloma]]**
5.  **[[Posterior Staphyloma]]**

### Types of Staphyloma

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Diagram showing the anatomical locations of the five types of staphyloma on a cross-section of the eye: Anterior, Intercalary, Ciliary, Equatorial, and Posterior

#### 1. Anterior Staphyloma
*   **Definition:** An ectasia of the [[Pseudocornea]] (scar formed from organized exudates and fibrous tissue covered with epithelium) lined posteriorly by the [[Iris]].
*   **Etiology:** It usually results from a sloughing [[Corneal Ulcer]] (often due to purulent conjunctivitis/ophthalmia neonatorum) that perforates. The iris prolapses, becomes inflamed, and is covered by exudates which organize to form a false cornea. Because this pseudocornea is thin and weak, it bulges forward due to IOP,.
*   **Clinical Appearance:** It may be partial or total. The bulging scar tissue is often lobulated and blackened with the underlying pigment of the iris, resembling a bunch of black grapes (hence the term "staphyloma"),.
*   **Sequelae:** The anterior chamber is flat, and [[Secondary Glaucoma]] often supervenes.

#### 2. Intercalary Staphyloma
*   **Location:** Occurs at the [[Limbus]]. It extends from the limbus up to **2 mm** behind it.
*   **Lining:** Lined internally by the root of the [[Iris]] and the anterior-most part of the [[Ciliary Body]],.
*   **Etiology:**
    *   Perforating injury of the peripheral cornea.
    *   Marginal corneal ulcer.
    *   [[Anterior Scleritis]] or [[Scleromalacia Perforans]].
    *   Complicated [[Cataract Surgery]] with poor wound apposition.
    *   [[Secondary Glaucoma]] causing progression of the bulge.
*   **Clinical Features:** Defective vision occurs due to marked [[Corneal Astigmatism]].

#### 3. Ciliary Staphyloma
*   **Location:** Affects the ciliary zone, occurring about **2–3 mm** away from the limbus and extending up to **8 mm** behind it,.
*   **Lining:** Lined by the [[Ciliary Body]].
*   **Appearance:** The area has a bluish color with a lobulated surface.
*   **Etiology:**
    *   [[Developmental Glaucoma]] (Buphthalmos).
    *   End-stage primary or secondary glaucoma.
    *   [[Scleritis]].
    *   Trauma to the ciliary region.

#### 4. Equatorial Staphyloma
*   **Location:** Occurs at the equatorial region of the eye, approximately **14 mm** behind the limbus.
*   **Lining:** Lined by the [[Choroid]].
*   **Pathogenesis:** The sclera in this region is inherently weak because it is perforated by the [[Vortex Veins]].
*   **Etiology:**
    *   [[Scleritis]].
    *   [[Degenerative Myopia]].
    *   Chronic uncontrolled glaucoma.

#### 5. Posterior Staphyloma
*   **Location:** Affects the posterior pole of the eye.
*   **Lining:** Lined by the [[Choroid]].
*   **Etiology:**
    *   **[[Pathological Myopia]]** (High axial myopia) is the most common cause.
    *   [[Posterior Scleritis]].
    *   Perforating injuries.
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   Not visible externally.
    *   **Ophthalmoscopy:** Reveals an excavated area with retinal vessels bending backward (dipping) over its margins. The floor is focused with minus lenses compared to the margins,.
    *   **Ultrasound:** [[B-scan Ultrasonography]] can detect the posterior outward curvature.
    *   **Clinical Implication:** The area may appear pale due to degenerative changes in the [[Retina]] and [[Retinal Pigment Epithelium]].

### Management

Treatment depends on the type, severity, and visual potential of the eye.

#### 1. Prophylaxis
*   Prompt treatment of inflammatory diseases affecting the outer coats (e.g., [[Scleritis]], [[Corneal Ulcer]], [[Keratomalacia]]).
*   Control of [[Intraocular Pressure]] to prevent secondary glaucoma and progression of ectasia.

#### 2. Surgical Management
*   **Localized Staphylectomy:**
    *   Indicated for **Intercalary Staphyloma** and **Anterior Staphyloma** (for cosmetic improvement).
    *   Requires excising the ectatic area and repair, often under heavy doses of oral steroids,.
*   **Patch Grafting:** Local excision and repair using a corneal or scleral patch graft.
*   **[[Keratoplasty]]:**
    *   Indicated for **Anterior Staphyloma** if there is a chance of restoring useful vision.
    *   [[Keratoprosthesis]] may be considered in severe cases.
*   **Enucleation:**
    *   Indicated for large, unsightly, painful blind eyes.
    *   The eye is removed and replaced with an orbital implant for cosmetic rehabilitation.
