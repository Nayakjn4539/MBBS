# [[Diseases Of Eyelids]] > Hordeolum Internum vs Hordeolum Externum

### Diseases of Eyelids: Hordeolum

**Hordeolum** is an acute suppurative inflammation of the glands of the eyelid. It is classified based on the anatomical location of the affected gland into **Hordeolum Externum** (Stye) and **Hordeolum Internum**.

#### Etiology
*   **Causative Organism:** Most commonly caused by **[[Staphylococcus aureus]]**.
*   **Predisposing Factors:**
    *   Young adults and children (though it can occur at any age).
    *   Eye strain (uncorrected refractive errors).
    *   Habitual rubbing of eyes or fingering of lids/nose.
    *   Chronic [[Blepharitis]].
    *   Metabolic factors (e.g., [[Diabetes Mellitus]]), chronic debility, excessive carbohydrate/alcohol intake.

#### Comparison: Hordeolum Externum vs. Hordeolum Internum

| Feature | [[Hordeolum Externum]] (Stye) | [[Hordeolum Internum]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | Acute suppurative inflammation of the lash follicle and its associated **[[Gland of Zeis]]** or **[[Gland of Moll]]**. | Acute suppurative inflammation of the **[[Meibomian gland]]**. |
| **Location** | Lid margin (Anterior lamella). | Deep in the tarsal plate (Posterior lamella). |
| **Pain Intensity** | Moderate acute pain. | **More intense pain** because the gland is embedded in the dense fibrous tissue of the [[Tarsal plate]]. |
| **Swelling** | Localized, hard, red, tender swelling at the lid margin. | Localized, firm, red, tender swelling of the lid; point of max tenderness is away from the lid margin. |
| **Pointing (Pus)** | Points at the lid margin, usually around the root of a lash (cilia). | Points on the **[[Tarsal conjunctiva]]** (seen as a yellowish area on everting the lid) or rarely at the gland opening. |
| **Relation to Chalazion**| Usually primary infection. | Can occur as a primary infection or secondary to an infected [[Chalazion]]. |

#### Clinical Management

**1. Conservative Treatment (Common to both)**
*   **Hot Fomentation:** Compresses applied 2–3 times a day to reduce pain, increase circulation, and accelerate suppuration.
*   **Medical Therapy:**
    *   **Systemic Analgesics/Anti-inflammatory drugs:** To relieve pain and edema.
    *   **Antibiotics:**
        *   Topical antibiotic eye drops (3–4 times a day) and ointment.
        *   Systemic antibiotics (Oral) are indicated if the infection is severe, recurrent, or if there is associated cellulitis/abscess.
    *   **Epilation:** For **External Hordeolum**, pulling out the affected eyelash facilitates drainage of pus and healing.

**2. Surgical Treatment**
Surgery is indicated if the abscess does not resolve spontaneously or point and drain.

*   **For Hordeolum Externum (Stye):**
    *   Incision is rarely needed; epilation usually suffices.
    *   If incision is required, a **Horizontal incision** is made on the skin side (parallel to the lid margin) to avoid cutting the fibers of the [[Orbicularis oculi]] muscle.

*   **For Hordeolum Internum:**
    *   Incision is made from the **[[Tarsal conjunctiva]]** side.
    *   **Incision Orientation:** **Vertical incision** is mandatory.
    *   **Reasoning:** A vertical incision is made parallel to the Meibomian glands to avoid cutting through adjacent healthy gland ducts, which could lead to scarring and future blockage.

#### Clinical Implications & Complications
*   **Preseptal Cellulitis:** Infection may spread to the subcutaneous tissue causing [[Cellulitis]].
*   **Recurrence:** Recurrent styes suggest uncorrected refractive errors, diabetes, or chronic blepharitis.
*   **Chalazion:** An untreated or partially resolved internal hordeolum may become a chronic granulomatous inflammation known as a chalazion.

### Mnemonics
*   **M**eibomian = **M**iddle (**I**nternal) -> **Hordeolum Internum**.
*   **Z**eis = **Z**ide (**S**ide/External) -> **Hordeolum Externum**.
*   **I**nternal = **I**nwards (Points inwards towards conjunctiva) -> Vertical **I**ncision (looks like letter **I**).
