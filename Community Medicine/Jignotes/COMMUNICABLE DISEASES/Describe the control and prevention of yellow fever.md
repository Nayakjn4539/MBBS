# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Describe the control and prevention of yellow fever

### Control and Prevention of Yellow Fever

Yellow fever is a zoonotic viral disease caused by a [[Flavivirus]] transmitted by mosquitoes. The strategies for control differ depending on whether the cycle is sylvatic (jungle) or urban.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> A flowchart depicting the two transmission cycles: 1. Jungle Cycle (Monkey -> Mosquito -> Monkey/Man) and 2. Urban Cycle (Man -> Aedes aegypti -> Man)

#### 1. Strategies for Control

The control measures are broadly classified based on the transmission cycle:

**A. Jungle Yellow Fever**
*   **Status:** Considered an uncontrollable disease because the virus maintains itself in the animal kingdom (monkeys).
*   **Vector Control:** Difficult and impractical in forest areas.
*   **Primary Measure:** **Vaccination** of humans entering forest areas is the *only* effective control measure,.

**B. Urban Yellow Fever**
*   **Vaccination:** The most effective strategy to protect the population at risk.
*   **Vector Control:** Ideally, the vector population ([[Aedes aegypti]]) should be reduced to the lowest possible level to stop transmission,.
*   **Surveillance:** Essential for early detection of the virus in humans or animals.

#### 2. Immunization (Specific Protection)

Active immunization is the most powerful weapon against Yellow Fever.

**The Vaccine: 17D Vaccine**
*   **Type:** [[Live Attenuated Vaccine]] (Freeze-dried/Lyophilized),,.
*   **Strain:** 17D strain grown in chick embryo,.
*   **Dose and Route:** **0.5 ml** administered **Subcutaneously** at the insertion of the deltoid,,.
*   **Storage (Cold Chain):** Very heat sensitive. Must be stored between +5°C and -30°C (preferably below 0°C). Once reconstituted, it must be used within **30 minutes to 1 hour** and kept on ice,.
*   **Immunity:** Antibodies appear by the **7th day**. Protection lasts for at least 35 years, possibly for **life**,,.

**Contraindications:**
*   Children aged **< 9 months** (risk of encephalitis),.
*   **Pregnancy** (except during outbreaks where risk of infection is high).
*   Persons with severe allergy to **egg protein**.
*   Symptomatic [[HIV/AIDS]] or immune-deficiency states,.

> **Clinical Relevance:** Cholera and Yellow Fever vaccines should **not** be given together. A gap of at least **3 weeks** is recommended to avoid interference,.

#### 3. Vector Control

The urban vector is the *Aedes aegypti* mosquito. Control measures include:
*   **Anti-larval measures:** Source reduction by eliminating breeding places (artificial containers, flower pots, discarded tins),.
*   **Anti-adult measures:** Aerial or ground fogging (aerosol spraying) with insecticides to rapidly reduce adult mosquito density during epidemics,.
*   **Indices for Surveillance:** To ensure freedom from Yellow Fever, the **[[Aedes aegypti index]]** (House Index) and the **[[Breteau Index]]** must be kept below **1%** in towns and seaports,,.

#### 4. International Health Regulations (IHR)

Strict international measures are enforced because India is a **[[Yellow Fever Receptive Area]]**. This means India has the vector (*Aedes*) and susceptible hosts (monkeys/humans) but the virus is currently absent. Introduction of the virus could lead to catastrophic epidemics,.

**Key Regulations:**
1.  **Notification:** Yellow fever is a notifiable disease internationally to the WHO,.
2.  **Travelers:**
    *   Any person entering India from an endemic area (Africa/South America) must possess a valid **International Certificate of Vaccination**,.
    *   **Validity:** The certificate becomes valid **10 days** after vaccination and extends for the **life** of the person,,.
3.  **Quarantine:**
    *   If a traveler does not have a valid certificate, they are placed in **[[Quarantine]]** in a mosquito-proof ward.
    *   **Duration:** **6 days** from the date of leaving the infected area (this covers the maximum incubation period of the disease),,.
4.  **Airports/Seaports:**
    *   Must be kept free of *Aedes* breeding for at least **400 meters** around the perimeter,.
    *   Aircraft and ships arriving from endemic areas are disinfected via aerosol spraying,.

### Mnemonics for Yellow Fever Control

**"YELL"**
*   **Y**ields immunity in 1 week (Valid from day 10).
*   **E**gg allergy is a contraindication.
*   **L**ive attenuated 17D Vaccine.
*   **L**ifelong protection (Single dose).

**"6-Pack"** (Quarantine Rule)
*   Quarantine is for **6 days** because the incubation period is **3 to 6 days**.
