### Maternal Health Problems in India

Maternal health problems in India are multifaceted, often revolving around the triad of **Malnutrition, Infection, and Unregulated Fertility**.

#### 1. Maternal Morbidity
For every maternal death, approximately 20 women suffer from illness or lowered efficiency.
*   **Nutritional Problems:**
    *   **Anemia:** The most common ailment. Approximately 50-60% of pregnant women are anemic [[Nutritional Anemia]]. Causes include iron deficiency, hookworm infestation, and malaria.
    *   **Malnutrition:** Leads to maternal depletion, low birth weight (LBW) babies, and increased risk of toxemias.
*   **Infections:**
    *   [[Puerperal Sepsis]]: Infection of the genital tract within 3 weeks after delivery.
    *   **Viral Hepatitis:** Specifically Hepatitis E, which has high mortality in pregnancy.
    *   **TORCH Infections:** Toxoplasmosis, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes.
    *   **HIV/AIDS:** Risk of Mother-to-Child Transmission (MTCT).
*   **Obstetric Complications:**
    *   **Hemorrhage:** Antepartum (APH) and Postpartum (PPH).
    *   **Hypertensive Disorders:** Pre-eclampsia and Eclampsia.
    *   **Obstructed Labor:** Often due to cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD) or malpresentation.
    *   **Abortion Complications:** Sequelae of unsafe abortions.

#### 2. Maternal Mortality
The **[[Maternal Mortality Ratio]] (MMR)** in India is a critical indicator. The major causes of maternal deaths in India (SRS data) are:

| Cause | Contribution (%) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Hemorrhage** (Most Common) | **38%** |
| Sepsis | 11% |
| Abortion | 8% |
| Hypertensive Disorders | 5% |
| Obstructed Labor | 5% |
| Other Conditions (Anemia, etc.) | 34% |

#### 3. Social and Environmental Determinants
*   **Early Marriage:** Teenage pregnancy increases risks.
*   **Poverty & Illiteracy:** Limits access to care and nutrition.
*   **Short Birth Interval:** Depletes maternal reserves.
*   **Lack of Trained Birth Attendants:** Delivery by untrained dais increases risk of sepsis and tetanus.

### Antenatal Care (ANC)

**Definition:** Antenatal care is the care of the woman during pregnancy. The primary aim is to achieve a healthy mother and a healthy baby at the end of pregnancy.

#### 1. Objectives of ANC
*   To promote, protect, and maintain the health of the mother.
*   To detect **[[High Risk Pregnancy]]** cases early and provide special attention.
*   To foresee complications and prevent them.
*   To reduce maternal and infant mortality and morbidity.
*   To remove anxiety associated with delivery.
*   To teach elements of childcare, nutrition, and personal hygiene.
*   To sensitize the mother to family planning.

#### 2. Antenatal Visits Schedule
 Ideally, a mother should attend the clinic once a month for the first 7 months, twice a month in the 8th month, and weekly thereafter. However, under the **[[National Health Mission]] (NHM)**, a minimum of **4 visits** are recommended:

*   **1st Visit:** Within 12 weeks (Early Registration).
*   **2nd Visit:** Between 14 and 26 weeks.
*   **3rd Visit:** Between 28 and 34 weeks.
*   **4th Visit:** Between 36 weeks and term.

#### 3. Components of ANC (Preventive Services)

**A. History Taking:**
*   Confirmation of pregnancy.
*   History of previous pregnancies (Bad Obstetric History).
*   Current medical conditions (Hypertension, Diabetes, TB).

**B. Physical Examination:**
*   **Weight:** Normal gain is 9–11 kg. <2 kg/month gain in later months indicates malnutrition or IUGR. Excessive gain (>3kg/month) suggests pre-eclampsia or twins.
*   **Blood Pressure:** To screen for Pregnancy Induced Hypertension (PIH).
*   **Pallor:** To detect [[Anemia]].
*   **Abdominal Exam:** Fundal height, fetal heart sound (FHS), and fetal lie/presentation.

**C. Laboratory Investigations:**
*   **Hemoglobin:** To check for anemia (<11 g/dl).
*   **Urine:** For Albumin (Pre-eclampsia) and Sugar (Gestational Diabetes).
*   **Blood Grouping:** Including Rh typing.
*   **Screening:** For Syphilis (VDRL), HIV, Hepatitis B (HBsAg), and Malaria (in endemic areas).

**D. Interventions and Prophylaxis:**
*   **Iron & Folic Acid (IFA):**
    *   *Prophylaxis:* 1 tablet daily for at least **100 days** (starts after 1st trimester).
    *   *Composition:* **100 mg Elemental Iron + 500 mcg Folic Acid**.
    *   *(Note: Recent Anemia Mukt Bharat guidelines suggest 60mg Iron + 500mcg Folic Acid for 180 days).*
*   **Tetanus Toxoid (TT/Td):**
    *   **1st Dose:** As soon as pregnancy is detected (early).
    *   **2nd Dose:** 4 weeks after the first dose (at least 1 month before EDD).
    *   **Booster:** If vaccinated within the last 3 years, only one booster dose is required.

**E. Prenatal Advice:**
*   **Diet:** Increase intake by **+350 Kcal/day** and **+23g protein/day** (ICMR 2020).
*   **Hygiene:** Personal cleanliness, breast care, and dental hygiene.
*   **Warning Signs:** Advise mother to report immediately if swelling of feet, convulsions, headache, blurring of vision, or bleeding per vagina occurs.

#### 4. Risk Approach
The central purpose of ANC is to identify "High Risk" cases who require skilled care at higher levels (FRUs).
*   **High Risk Criteria:**
    *   Elderly primi (Age >30 years).
    *   Short stature (<140 cm).
    *   Malpresentation (Breech/Transverse).
    *   Anemia, Pre-eclampsia, Twins/Hydramnios.
    *   History of Stillbirth or CS.

**Mnemonic for High Risk Pregnancy:** **"SAD MOTHERS"**
*   **S**hort stature (<140cm)
*   **A**nemia
*   **D**iseases (HTN, DM, TB)
*   **M**alpresentation
*   **O**ld primi (>30 yrs)
*   **T**wins
*   **H**istory of bad obstetric outcome (Stillbirth, CS)
*   **E**lderly grand multipara
*   **R**H incompatibility
*   **S**ocial factors (Poverty)
