# Factors Affecting Fracture Healing

Fracture healing is a complex physiological process influenced by multiple variables. These factors determine whether a fracture unites rapidly, undergoes [[delayed union]], or results in [[non-union]]. These can be broadly classified into **General (Systemic) Factors** and **Local Factors**.

### 1. General (Systemic) Factors
These factors relate to the patient's overall health and physiological status.

*   **Age**:
    *   Fractures heal much faster in children compared to adults. The remodeling potential is also significantly higher in the pediatric skeleton.
    *   Healing slows down with advancing age.
*   **Nutritional Status**:
    *   Adequate intake of **Protein**, **Calcium**, and **Vitamins** (especially Vitamin C and D) is essential for matrix formation and mineralization.
    *   Malnutrition and general debility retard healing.
*   **Hormonal Factors**:
    *   **Promoters**: [[Growth Hormone]], [[Insulin]], Anabolic Steroids, [[Thyroxine]], and [[Calcitonin]] enhance fracture healing.
    *   **Inhibitors**: [[Corticosteroids]] (inhibit calcium absorption and osteoblast activity) and uncontrolled [[Diabetes Mellitus]] retard healing.
*   **Systemic Diseases**:
    *   Conditions like [[Osteoporosis]], [[Rickets]], [[Osteomalacia]], and Anemia can delay the healing process.
    *   [[HIV]] or immunocompromised states may affect the body's response to injury.
*   **Habits**:
    *   **Smoking (Nicotine)**: Causes vasoconstriction and decreases oxygen tension at the fracture site, significantly inhibiting healing.
    *   **Alcoholism**: associated with poor nutrition and falls, also directly affects bone metabolism.

### 2. Local Factors
These factors are specific to the fractured bone and the surrounding environment.

#### A. Nature of the Bone and Fracture
*   **Type of Bone**:
    *   **Cancellous Bone** (Metaphysis/Flat bones): Heals faster due to a sponge-like meshwork and rich blood supply (e.g., [[Colles' fracture]], [[Intertrochanteric fracture]]).
    *   **Cortical Bone** (Diaphysis/Shaft): Heals slower as it requires internal remodeling (Haversian remodeling).
*   **Pattern of Fracture**:
    *   **Spiral fractures**: Heal faster due to a larger surface area of contact between fragments.
    *   **Transverse fractures**: Heal slower due to smaller contact area.
    *   **Comminuted fractures**: Can heal slowly if fragments are devascularized, or rapidly if the periosteal sleeve is intact and blood supply is preserved.
*   **Vascularity**:
    *   This is the **most important factor**. Fractures at sites with precarious blood supply are prone to [[Avascular Necrosis]] (AVN) or non-union.
    *   *High Risk Areas:* Neck of [[Femur]], Body of [[Talus]], Proximal pole of [[Scaphoid]].

#### B. Injury Environment
*   **Soft Tissue Injury (Open Fractures)**:
    *   Severe soft tissue damage (periosteal stripping) disrupts the blood supply to the bone fragments.
    *   [[Open fractures]] often lose the fracture hematoma, which is the primary medium for the initial stages of healing.
*   **Infection**:
    *   Common in open fractures or post-surgery.
    *   Causes bone lysis, necrosis, and formation of [[Sequestrum]], preventing union.
*   **Intra-articular Extension**:
    *   Synovial fluid contains **collagenases** which can lyse the initial clot and retard fracture healing.

### 3. Treatment Factors (Iatrogenic)
These factors are often within the control of the treating surgeon.

*   **Immobilization**:
    *   Adequate immobilization is crucial to prevent macromotion (which causes fibrous tissue formation/pseudarthrosis).
    *   However, **rigid fixation** (absolute stability) leads to **primary bone healing** (no callus), while **relative stability** (casts/intramedullary nails) leads to **secondary bone healing** (callus formation).
*   **Reduction (Contact)**:
    *   At least **50% apposition** of fracture ends is desirable.
    *   **Soft Tissue Interposition**: Muscle or periosteum caught between fragments prevents contact and leads to non-union.
*   **Distraction**:
    *   Excessive traction or distractors can pull bone ends apart. If the gap is significant, bone cannot bridge the defect.
*   **Disturbance of Hematoma**:
    *   Surgically opening a fracture releases the [[Fracture Hematoma]] and may strip the periosteum, potentially delaying the natural healing process if not compensated by stable fixation.

### Summary of Factors

| **Factors Promoting Healing** | **Factors Inhibiting Healing** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Growth Hormone**, **Thyroid Hormone**, **Calcitonin**, **Insulin** | **Corticosteroids**, **NSAIDS** (in high doses) |
| **Vitamin C & D**, **Calcium** | **Nicotine** (Smoking), **Alcohol** |
| **Head Injury** (causes exuberant callus) | **Diabetes Mellitus**, **Anemia** |
| **Mechanical loading/Compression** (Wolff's Law) | **Distraction** of fragments |
| **Electric Stimulation**, **Ultrasound** (LIPUS) | **Infection** ([[Osteomyelitis]]) |
| **Cancellous Bone** | **Cortical Bone**, **Intra-articular fractures** |
| **Good Vascularity** | **Avascularity**, **Soft tissue interposition** |

### Clinical Implications
1.  **Patient Counseling**: Patients with fractures must be strictly advised to **stop smoking**, as nicotine is a potent inhibitor of revascularization.
2.  **Diabetes Control**: Strict glycemic control is required in diabetic patients to prevent delayed union and infection.
3.  **NSAIDs Usage**: Long-term use of NSAIDs is generally avoided in the acute fracture healing phase as they inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, which is necessary for osteoblast activity.
4.  **Open Fractures**: Require aggressive debridement and soft tissue coverage to convert them into a closed environment to facilitate healing.

### Mnemonics
