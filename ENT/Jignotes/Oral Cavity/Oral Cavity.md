# [[Oral Cavity]] > Oral Cavity

### **Anatomy of the Oral Cavity**

The **[[Oral Cavity]]** extends from the vermilion border of the lips anteriorly to the junction of the hard and soft palate above and the line of circumvallate papillae below. It communicates posteriorly with the **[[Oropharynx]]** through the oropharyngeal isthmus.

#### **Subsites of the Oral Cavity**
The oral cavity is divided into specific subsites for anatomical and oncological classification,:
1.  **Lips:** Vermilion border (mucocutaneous junction).
2.  **Buccal Mucosa:** Lining of cheeks and lips, extending to the pterygomandibular raphe.
3.  **Upper and Lower Alveolar Ridges (Gingiva):** Mucosa covering the alveolar process of maxilla and mandible.
4.  **Retromolar Trigone (RMT):** Triangular mucosal area behind the last molar.
5.  **Hard Palate:** Forms the roof of the oral cavity.
6.  **Floor of Mouth (FOM):** Crescent-shaped area between the gingiva and the undersurface of the tongue.
7.  **Oral Tongue:** Anterior 2/3rd of the tongue (anterior to circumvallate papillae).

> **Clinical Implication:** It is crucial to distinguish the oral cavity from the oropharynx. The **[[Soft Palate]]**, **[[Base of Tongue]]** (posterior 1/3), **[[Palatine Tonsils]]**, and posterior pharyngeal wall are parts of the **Oropharynx**, not the Oral Cavity,,.

### **Detailed Anatomy of Key Structures**

#### **1. Retromolar Trigone (RMT)**
A small triangular mucosal area of great surgical importance,.
*   **Location:** Behind the last mandibular molar.
*   **Boundaries:**
    *   *Anterior:* Last molar tooth.
    *   *Posterior:* Anterior border of the ascending ramus of the mandible.
    *   *Medial:* Anterior tonsillar pillar.
    *   *Lateral:* Buccal mucosa.
*   **Significance:** Tumors here spread rapidly to the temporalis muscle, **[[Pterygoid Muscles]]** (causing trismus), and the **[[Parapharyngeal Space]]**.

#### **2. Tongue (Oral Part)**
*   **Extent:** Anterior two-thirds, movable part.
*   **Sensory Supply:**
    *   *General Sensation:* **[[Lingual Nerve]]** (Branch of V3).
    *   *Taste:* **[[Chorda Tympani]]** (Branch of Facial Nerve).
*   **Motor Supply:** **[[Hypoglossal Nerve]]** (CN XII) supplies all intrinsic and extrinsic muscles except the **[[Palatoglossus]]**, which is supplied by the pharyngeal plexus,.

#### **3. Floor of Mouth**
*   Contains the sublingual glands and the opening of the **[[Submandibular Duct]]** (Wharton's duct) at the sublingual papilla near the frenulum.
*   **Lymphatic Drainage:** Anterior floor drains to submental and submandibular nodes (Level I).

### **Lymphatic Drainage of Oral Cavity**

Understanding lymphatic drainage is vital for managing metastasis,.

| Site | Primary Drainage Nodes |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Lips (Lower - Central)** | Submental Nodes (Level Ia) |
| **Lips (Lower - Lateral) & Upper Lip** | Submandibular Nodes (Level Ib) |
| **Tip of Tongue** | Submental & Jugulo-omohyoid Nodes |
| **Lateral Tongue / FOM** | Submandibular & Upper Deep Cervical |
| **Buccal Mucosa** | Submandibular Nodes |

### **Clinical Examination of the Oral Cavity**

A systematic approach is required:
1.  **Inspection:** Use two tongue depressors to retract the cheek and tongue to view the lateral gutters (gingivobuccal sulcus).
2.  **Palpation:**
    *   **Digital Palpation:** Essential for the base of tongue and tonsillolingual sulcus (coffin corner) to detect induration not visible on inspection.
    *   **Bimanual Palpation:** For the floor of the mouth to differentiate submandibular gland enlargement from lymph nodes.
3.  **Trismus Assessment:** Normal mouth opening is 35–45 mm.
    *   *Grade I (Mild):* 30–40 mm.
    *   *Grade II (Moderate):* 15–30 mm.
    *   *Grade III (Severe):* < 15 mm.
    *   *Grade IV:* Locked.

### **Common Benign Lesions**

#### **1. Ulcers**
*   **Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis:** Painful, superficial ulcers on *non-keratinized* mucosa (lips, buccal mucosa, soft palate). Classification: Minor (<1cm), Major (>1cm), Herpetiform,.
*   **Traumatic Ulcer:** Due to jagged teeth or dentures; usually on the lateral border of the tongue.
*   **Herpes Simplex:** Vesicles rupturing to form ulcers, usually on *keratinized* mucosa (hard palate, gingiva).

#### **2. Cysts**
*   **[[Ranula]]**: A retention cyst of the **[[Sublingual Gland]]** found in the floor of the mouth. It is translucent and bluish. If it extends into the neck (through the mylohyoid muscle), it is called a **Plunging Ranula**,.
*   **Mucous Retention Cyst:** Common on the lower lip due to minor salivary gland obstruction.

#### **3. Premalignant Lesions**
*   **[[Leukoplakia]]**: A white patch that cannot be rubbed off and cannot be characterized as any other disease. It is a diagnosis of exclusion,.
*   **[[Erythroplakia]]**: A red patch with a higher risk of malignancy than leukoplakia.
*   **Oral Submucous Fibrosis (OSMF):** Chronic, progressive scarring of the oral mucosa associated with areca nut/betel quid chewing. Features include blanching, fibrous bands, and progressive trismus,.

### **Malignant Tumors: Oral Cancer**

**Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)** accounts for >90% of oral malignancies.

#### **Risk Factors (The 6 S's)**:
1.  **S**moking (Tobacco).
2.  **S**pirits (Alcohol).
3.  **S**harp tooth (Chronic trauma).
4.  **S**epsis (Poor hygiene).
5.  **S**pices.
6.  **S**yphilis.

#### **Clinical Features**
*   Non-healing ulcer (>3 weeks).
*   Indurated margins (rolled out/everted).
*   Loosening of teeth (alveolar carcinoma).
*   Referred otalgia (via CN V, IX, or X).
*   **Neck Mass:** Level I and II nodes are most commonly involved.

#### **Common Sites & Behavior**
| Site | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Oral Tongue** | Most common site is the lateral border. High metastatic potential due to rich lymphatics,. |
| **Lip** | Lower lip > Upper lip. Better prognosis. |
| **Buccal Mucosa** | Common in India (tobacco chewing). Often associated with leukoplakia. |
| **Hard Palate** | Rare for SCC; more common for minor salivary gland tumors (e.g., Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma). |

#### **TNM Staging (Simplified)**,
*   **T1:** Tumor ≤ 2 cm.
*   **T2:** Tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm.
*   **T3:** Tumor > 4 cm.
*   **T4a:** Invades cortical bone, deep extrinsic muscle of tongue, maxillary sinus, or skin.

#### **Treatment Principles**
*   **Surgery:** Wide local excision with adequate margins (1–1.5 cm) is the primary modality.
    *   *Mandible:* Marginal mandibulectomy (if periosteum not breached) vs. Segmental mandibulectomy (if bone invaded).
    *   *Neck:* Neck dissection (Selective or Radical) for nodal metastasis.
*   **Radiotherapy:** For early lesions or adjuvant in advanced cases.

> **Mnemonic for Referred Otalgia:**
> **"5, 9, 10 - Pain in the Ear again!"**
> *   **CN V:** Oral cavity/Dental causes.
> *   **CN IX:** Oropharynx/Tonsil/Base of Tongue.
> *   **CN X:** Larynx/Hypopharynx malignancy.

### **Infections: Deep Neck Spaces**

#### **[[Ludwig's Angina]]**
*   **Definition:** Bilateral cellulitis of the submandibular, sublingual, and submental spaces.
*   **Etiology:** 80% odontogenic (dental caries), specifically lower 2nd or 3rd molars (roots lie below the mylohyoid line),.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   "Woody" hard, brawny edema of the floor of mouth.
    *   Tongue pushed up and back (Airway danger!).
    *   Trismus, drooling, fever.
*   **Treatment:**
    1.  **Secure Airway:** Tracheostomy if necessary (fiberoptic intubation is difficult).
    2.  **IV Antibiotics.**
    3.  **Incision & Drainage:** Wide incision to decompress the spaces.
