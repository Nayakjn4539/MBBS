# [[Surgical Procedures]] > Total Elbow Replacement

### Total Elbow Replacement (TER)

**Total Elbow Replacement**, also known as [[Total Elbow Arthroplasty]] (TEA), is a surgical procedure utilized to relieve pain and restore function in a damaged elbow joint. While less common than hip or knee replacements, it is a salvage procedure that offers significant functional improvement for patients with severe joint destruction.

### Indications

The primary indication for TER is severe pain and limitation of motion that has failed conservative management.

1.  **[[Rheumatoid Arthritis]] (RA):** This is the most common indication. RA causes severe erosive destruction of the joint surface and instability.
2.  **[[Osteoarthritis]] (OA):**
    *   **Post-traumatic OA:** Sequelae of distal humerus fractures.
    *   **Primary OA:** Less common in the elbow than weight-bearing joints.
3.  **Trauma:**
    *   Comminuted [[Distal Humerus Fractures]] in elderly patients with osteoporotic bone (where internal fixation is difficult or likely to fail).
    *   Distal humeral non-unions.
4.  **Tumors:** Requiring resection of the elbow joint.
5.  **Gross Instability:** Due to bone loss.

**Clinical Implication:** TER is predominantly a "pain-relieving" surgery rather than a "strength-restoring" surgery. It is ideal for low-demand patients (like those with RA) who do not require heavy lifting.

### Contraindications

*   **Active Infection:** Absolute contraindication (e.g., active sepsis or history of recent septic arthritis).
*   **Paralysis:** Loss of flexor (biceps/brachialis) or extensor ([[Triceps]]) function. A functioning triceps is crucial for the stability and function of the prosthesis.
*   **Neuropathic Joint:** [[Charcot joint]].
*   **Young, High-Demand Patients:** Due to the risk of mechanical failure and loosening from heavy use.

### Types of Prostheses

Prostheses are generally classified based on the degree of constraint (stability) they provide.

| Type | Description | Indications |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unconstrained (Unlinked)** | Relies on the patient's own soft tissues (ligaments/capsule) for stability. The humeral and ulnar components are not mechanically connected. | Patients with good bone stock and intact collateral ligaments. |
| **Semiconstrained (Linked)** | The humeral and ulnar components are mechanically linked (often by a locking pin). The prosthesis provides stability ("sloppy hinge"). | Patients with significant bone loss or ligamentous insufficiency (common in RA and trauma). |

*Note: [[Baksi's prosthesis]] is a specific type mentioned in orthopedic literature for elbow replacement.*

### Surgical Technique

The procedure aims to replace the damaged articular surfaces of the distal humerus and proximal ulna.

#### 1. Anesthesia and Positioning
*   **Anesthesia:** General anesthesia or regional block.
*   **Positioning:** Lateral decubitus position with the arm over a bolster, or supine with the arm across the chest. A [[Tourniquet]] is applied to the upper arm.

#### 2. Approach
*   **Posterior Approach:** A straight incision is made over the posterior aspect of the elbow, slightly lateral to the olecranon tip to avoid direct pressure on the scar later.
*   **Ulnar Nerve Handling:** The [[Ulnar Nerve]] is identified, dissected, and carefully protected. It is often transposed anteriorly to prevent impingement or traction injury.

#### 3. Deep Dissection
*   **Triceps Management:** The triceps mechanism must be handled carefully. Techniques include:
    *   Triceps splitting.
    *   Triceps reflecting (Bryan-Morrey approach).
    *   Olecranon osteotomy (rarely used for replacements due to fixation issues).

#### 4. Bone Preparation
*   **Resection:** The distal humerus (trochlea and capitellum) and the proximal ulna (part of the olecranon and coronoid) are resected using an oscillating saw.
*   **Canal Preparation:** The medullary canals of the humerus and ulna are located, broached, and reamed to accept the prosthesis stems.

#### 5. Implantation
*   **Trial Reduction:** Trial components are inserted to check for range of motion, stability, and proper tracking.
*   **Cementing:** The canals are cleaned and dried. [[Polymethylmethacrylate]] (PMMA) bone cement is introduced, and the final components are inserted.
*   **Linkage:** If a semiconstrained device is used, the humeral and ulnar components are linked via a pin or snap-fit mechanism.

#### 6. Closure
*   The triceps mechanism is securely repaired (crucial for extensor function).
*   The ulnar nerve is protected (transposed if necessary).
*   Wound closed in layers over a drain.

### Complications

1.  **Infection:**
    *   The elbow has a thin soft tissue envelope, making it prone to wound healing problems and deep infection.
    *   *Clinical Implication:* Requires aggressive management, often necessitating removal of the implant.

2.  **Ulnar Nerve Neuropathy:**
    *   Can occur due to traction, compression, or scar tissue formation.
    *   Symptoms: Numbness in the ring/little finger and weakness of intrinsic muscles.

3.  **Aseptic Loosening:**
    *   Mechanical failure at the bone-cement interface over time.

4.  **Periprosthetic Fracture:**
    *   Fractures occurring around the stem of the implant (humerus or ulna), often due to trauma or loosening.

5.  **Triceps Insufficiency:**
    *   Weakness or rupture of the triceps tendon repair, leading to loss of active extension.

---

### Post-operative Rehabilitation

*   **Immobilization:** The elbow is usually splinted in extension or slight flexion for a few days to allow wound healing.
*   **Mobilization:** Gentle active-assisted Range of Motion (ROM) exercises are started early to prevent stiffness.
*   **Restrictions:**
    *   **Lifetime Lifting Restriction:** Patients are typically restricted from lifting objects heavier than 1–2 kg (single event) or 5 kg (repetitive) to prevent loosening and wear.
    *   No impact loading (hammering, golfing).
