# [[Phacoemulsification]] Surgery and Instrumentation

**Phacoemulsification** is the standard of care for cataract extraction. It utilizes a device with a piezoelectric crystal tip that vibrates at ultrasonic frequency (approx. 40,000 Hz) to emulsify the lens nucleus, which is then aspirated. This allows for small incision surgery, resulting in faster visual rehabilitation and minimal [[astigmatism]].

### I. Essential Surgical Instruments

The following instruments are critical for performing phacoemulsification and [[Manual Small Incision Cataract Surgery]] (SICS).

#### 1. Eye Speculums
Used to keep the eyelids apart during surgery.
*   **Universal Metallic Eye Speculum:** Can be used for the right or left eye. Has a spring mechanism and screw adjustment.
*   **Wire Speculum (Barraquer):** Very lightweight.
    *   **Clinical Advantage:** Preferred in phacoemulsification because it exerts minimal pressure on the globe, reducing the risk of vitreous upthrust.
*   **Guarded Speculum:** Has solid blades to cover the eyelashes and keep them out of the surgical field.

#### 2. Colibri Forceps
*   **Description:** Forceps with very fine 1x2 teeth at the tip.
*   **Use:**
    *   Holding the corneal or scleral edge of the incision for suturing.
    *   Stabilizing the globe during incision creation.

#### 3. Side-Port Blade (15° Knife)
*   **Description:** Fine straight knife with a sharp pointed tip and cutting edge on one side.
*   **Use:**
    *   Creates the **Side Port Incision (Paracentesis)**: A small valvular clear corneal incision (approx. 1.5 mm).
    *   Used for the introduction of the "second instrument" (chopper/dialer) during surgery.

#### 4. Angular Keratome (Slit Knife)
*   **Description:** Diamond-shaped blade with a sharp apex and two cutting edges. Available in sizes 2.8 mm, 3.0 mm, and 3.2 mm.
*   **Use:**
    *   Creates the **Main Port Incision**: A self-sealing valvular clear corneal incision for the entry of the phaco probe and IOL injector,.

#### 5. Sclerocorneal Splitter / Crescent Knife
*   **Description:** Blunt-tipped, bevel-up knife with a curved blade. It has a cut-splitting action at the tip and sides.
*   **Use:**
    *   **Sclerocorneal Tunnel:** Essential in Manual SICS to create a tunnel in the sclera extending into the clear cornea.
    *   **Flap Dissection:** Used to separate conjunctiva or scleral lamellae.

#### 6. Capsulorhexis Forceps
*   **Description:** Very fine, delicate forceps with small curved tips (often Utrata style).
*   **Use:**
    *   Performing **[[Continuous Curvilinear Capsulorhexis]] (CCC)**.
    *   Grasping and tearing the anterior capsule in a circular fashion to create a widely patent opening for phacoemulsification.

#### 7. McPherson’s Forceps (Kelman-McPherson)
*   **Description:** Fine forceps with bent limbs.
*   **Uses:**
    *   Holding the superior haptic of the [[Intraocular Lens]] (IOL) during placement.
    *   Tearing the anterior capsular flap in older ECCE techniques.
    *   Suture tying.

#### 8. Intraocular Lens Dialer (Sinskey Hook)
*   **Description:** Fine stout instrument with a bent tip.
*   **Uses:**
    *   **Dialing:** Engaging the dialing holes of a PMMA IOL or the optic-haptic junction of a foldable IOL to rotate it into the capsular bag.
    *   **Manipulation:** Used as a "second instrument" (chopper) to manipulate/rotate the nucleus during phacoemulsification.

### II. Surgical Steps of Phacoemulsification

The procedure is typically performed under topical anesthesia or peribulbar block.

| Step | Procedure | Instrument Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Exposure** | Cleaning, draping, and separating eyelids. | **Wire Speculum** (preferred) |
| **2. Side Port** | Creating a 1.5mm incision at 9 o'clock (for right-handed surgeon). | **15° Side-Port Blade** |
| **3. AC Maintenance**| Injection of [[Ocular Viscoelastic Device]] (OVD) to maintain space and protect endothelium. | Cannula |
| **4. Main Incision** | Creating a self-sealing clear corneal tunnel (2.8–3.2mm) at 11-12 o'clock. | **Angular Keratome** |
| **5. Capsulotomy** | Creating a circular opening in the anterior capsule (CCC). | **Capsulorhexis Forceps** or Cystitome |
| **6. Hydro-steps** | **Hydrodissection:** Separating cortex from capsule.<br>**Hydrodelineation:** Separating epinucleus from nucleus. | Hydrodissection Cannula |
| **7. Emulsification** | Fragmentation and aspiration of the nucleus. Techniques: *Divide and Conquer, Stop and Chop, Direct Chop*. | Phaco Probe + **Sinskey Hook** / Chopper |
| **8. I/A** | Irrigation and Aspiration of residual cortex. | I/A Probe |
| **9. IOL Implantation**| Injection of foldable IOL into the capsular bag. | IOL Injector or **McPherson Forceps** |
| **10. Finalizing** | Positioning the IOL and removing OVD. | **Sinskey Hook / IOL Dialer** |
| **11. Closure** | Hydration of corneal incisions (stromal edema) to seal the wound. | Cannula |

### III. Clinical Implications & Complications

*   **Wound Construction:** A poorly constructed incision using the **Keratome** can lead to iris prolapse, wound leak, or [[Surgically Induced Astigmatism]] (SIA).
*   **Capsulorhexis:** A small CCC predisposes to [[Posterior Capsular Rupture]] (PCR) or zonular stress. An eccentric CCC may cause IOL decentration.
*   **Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome (TASS):** An acute sterile inflammation caused by instrumental toxicity (e.g., residue on reusable instruments).
*   **Posterior Capsular Opacification (PCO):** The most common late complication, treated with Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy.
