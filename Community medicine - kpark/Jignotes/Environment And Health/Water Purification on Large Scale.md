# Purification of Water on a Large Scale: Rapid Sand Filters

Rapid sand filters, also known as **Mechanical Filters**, were first installed in the USA in 1885. They are of two types: the **Gravity type** (e.g., [[Paterson's filter]]) and the **Pressure type** (e.g., Candy's filter). The following steps are involved in the purification of water using these filters.

### Steps of Purification

The process involves four essential steps:

**1. Coagulation**
*   Raw water is first treated with a chemical coagulant, usually [[alum]].
*   **Dose:** Varies from **5 to 40 mg/litre** depending on turbidity, color, temperature, and pH.
*   **Rapid Mixing:** The water is subjected to violent agitation in a "mixing chamber" for a few minutes to ensure dissemination of alum throughout the bulk of water.

**2. Flocculation**
*   This phase involves slow and gentle stirring of treated water in a "flocculation chamber" for about **30 minutes**.
*   This results in the formation of a thick, copious, white flocculent precipitate of [[aluminum hydroxide]], known as **Floc**.
*   The thicker the flock diameter, the greater the settling velocity.

**3. Sedimentation**
*   The coagulated water is detained in [[sedimentation tanks]] for **2–6 hours**.
*   The flocculent precipitate, along with impurities and bacteria, settles down as sludge.
*   **Crucial Point:** At least **95%** of the flocculent precipitate must be removed before the water enters the filters.

**4. Filtration**
*   The partly clarified water is then subjected to rapid sand filtration.
*   **Mechanism:** As filtration proceeds, the "alum-floc" not removed by sedimentation is held back on the sand bed. It forms a slimy layer which adsorbs bacteria from the water (comparable to the [[zoogleal layer]] in slow sand filters).
*   **Rate of Filtration:** It is high, approximately **5–15 $m^3/m^2/hour$** (or **200 m.g.a.d** - million gallons per acre per day).

### Filter Bed Characteristics

*   **Sand:** The filtering medium is **coarse sand**.
    *   **Effective size:** 0.4 – 0.7 mm.
    *   **Depth:** Usually about 1 metre (2.5 to 3 feet).
*   **Gravel:** Supports the sand bed and permits filtered water to move freely to under-drains.
    *   **Depth:** 30 to 40 cm.
*   **Under-drainage system:** Located at the bottom to collect filtered water.

### Backwashing (Cleaning)

Unlike slow sand filters which are scraped, rapid sand filters are cleaned by **backwashing**.
*   **Indicator:** When the **"loss of head"** (resistance to flow) approaches **6–8 feet**, filtration is stopped.
*   **Process:** Clean water and compressed air are forced from below the filter bed upwards (reversing the flow) to dislodge impurities.
*   **Duration:** The washing process takes about **15 minutes**.
*   **Frequency:** Daily or weekly, depending on the loss of head.

### Advantages
1.  Can deal with raw water directly (no preliminary storage needed).
2.  Occupies very little space.
3.  Rapid filtration (40–50 times faster than slow sand filters).
4.  Flexibility in operation.

### Comparison: Rapid Sand Filters vs. Slow Sand Filters

This is a high-yield topic for exams.

| Feature | Rapid Sand Filter (Mechanical) | Slow Sand Filter (Biological) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Space** | Occupies very little space | Occupies large area |
| **Rate of Filtration** | **200 m.g.a.d.** (High) | **2-3 m.g.a.d.** (Low) |
| **Effective size of sand** | **0.4 – 0.7 mm** (Coarser) | **0.2 – 0.3 mm** (Finer) |
| **Preliminary Treatment** | Chemical coagulation & sedimentation | Plain sedimentation |
| **Washing Method** | By [[backwashing]] | By scraping the sand bed |
| **Operation** | Highly skilled | Less skilled |
| **Loss of Head Allowed** | **6 – 8 feet** | **4 feet** |
| **Removal of Bacteria** | **98 – 99%** | **99.9 – 99.99%** |
| **Removal of Color** | Good | Fair |
| **Suitability** | Big cities | Small towns |

### Mnemonic
To remember the steps of Rapid Sand Filtration: **C**aptain **F**alcon **S**aves **F**ishes
*   **C** - Coagulation (Alum)
*   **F** - Flocculation (Gentle stirring)
*   **S** - Sedimentation (Settling of sludge)
*   **F** - Filtration (Rapid sand bed)

### Clinical Relevance
While rapid sand filters are efficient for turbidity and color removal, they remove only 98-99% of bacteria (compared to 99.9% in slow sand filters). Therefore, **disinfection (Chlorination)** is an absolute **mandatory** step after rapid sand filtration to ensure the water is safe for human consumption and to prevent [[water-borne diseases]] like Typhoid and Cholera.
