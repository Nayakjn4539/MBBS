# [[Nutrition And Health]] > Fluorosis

### **Fluorosis (Dental and Skeletal)**

[[Fluorine]] is often described as a **"double-edged sword"**. It is an essential element for the normal mineralization of bones and the formation of dental enamel, but ingestion in excess or deficiency leads to pathological states.

### **Epidemiological Determinants**

**1. Agent Factors**
*   **Source:** The major source is [[Drinking water]].
*   **Food Sources:** Sea fish, cheese, and tea are rich in fluorides.
*   **Body Distribution:** About 96% of fluoride in the body is found in bones and teeth.
*   **Safe Levels:** The recommended level of fluoride in drinking water in India is **0.5 to 0.8 mg/L**. In temperate climates (where water intake is lower), the optimum is 1–2 mg/L.

**2. Host Factors**
*   **Age:** Dental fluorosis occurs when excess fluoride is ingested during the years of tooth calcification (first **7 years** of life). Skeletal fluorosis affects older adults after lifetime exposure.
*   **Diet:** Diets based on **Sorghum (Jowar)** promote higher retention of ingested fluoride compared to rice-based diets (associated with Genu Valgum).

**3. Environmental Factors**
*   High fluoride content in groundwater (geological belts).
*   Prevalent in Indian states like Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Tamil Nadu.

### **Spectrum of Fluoride Intake**

The biological effects of fluoride depend heavily on its concentration in drinking water.

| Fluoride Concentration (mg/L) | Effect on Health |
| :--- | :--- |
| **< 0.5** | **[[Dental Caries]]** (Deficiency) |
| **0.5 – 0.8** | **Optimum** (Prevents caries, strong bones) |
| **> 1.5** | **[[Dental Fluorosis]]** (Mottling of enamel) |
| **3.0 – 6.0** | **[[Skeletal Fluorosis]]** |
| **> 10.0** | **Crippling Fluorosis** |

### **Clinical Features: Dental Fluorosis**

This condition affects the permanent teeth and develops *only* during the period of formation (first 7 years of life).

*   **Early Sign:** Loss of shiny appearance of teeth; development of **chalky white patches** (Mottling).
*   **Progression:** White patches turn yellow, brown, or black.
*   **Severe Cases:** Loss of enamel gives teeth a corroded/pitted appearance.
*   **Site:** Best seen on the **incisors of the upper jaw**.

### **Clinical Features: Skeletal Fluorosis**

This affects the bones and ligaments due to heavy deposition of fluoride over a lifetime.

*   **Symptoms:** Pain and rigidity of the spine and joints.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Exostosis:** Irregular bone deposition on the anterior border of the tibia, olecranon, and spine.
    *   **Kyphosis:** Deformity of the spine.
    *   **Immobility:** Calcification of ligaments leads to a "poker back" or rigid spine.
    *   **Neurological:** Compression of the spinal cord can cause paresthesia, muscle wasting, and loss of sphincter control.

### **Genu Valgum (Knock-Knees)**

A specific form of fluorosis reported in South India (Andhra Pradesh/Tamil Nadu) among people whose staple diet is **Sorghum (Jowar)**.
*   **Features:** Osteoporosis of lower limbs and genu valgum deformities.
*   **Mechanism:** Sorghum diet promotes higher retention of fluoride than rice.

---

### **Diagnosis**

1.  **Clinical:** Characteristic "Mottling" of teeth or skeletal rigidity in an endemic area.
2.  **Urine Analysis:** Best indicator of recent exposure.
3.  **Radiology:** Increased bone density (Osteosclerosis), calcification of interosseous membranes.
4.  **Water Analysis:** Testing drinking water fluoride levels.

### **Prevention and Control**

Fluorosis is irreversible; therefore, prevention is the only cure.

**1. Changing the Water Source**
*   Switch to surface water (rivers/reservoirs) which generally has lower fluoride than groundwater (wells).

**2. Chemical Treatment ([[Nalgonda Technique]])**
Developed by NEERI (National Environmental Engineering Research Institute), Nagpur. It involves adding chemicals in a specific **sequence** to precipitate fluoride:
1.  **Lime** (Calcium oxide)
2.  **Alum** (Aluminum sulphate) - *Major agent*
3.  **Bleaching powder** (for disinfection)
*   **Process:** Rapid mixing $\rightarrow$ Flocculation $\rightarrow$ Sedimentation $\rightarrow$ Filtration.

**3. Other Measures**
*   **Vitamin C:** Adequate intake helps in preventing fluorosis damage.
*   **Avoidance:** Do not use fluoride supplements or fluoride toothpaste for children up to 6 years in endemic areas.

### **Mnemonic**

**For Nalgonda Technique Sequence:**
**"LAB"**
*   **L**ime
*   **A**lum
*   **B**leaching powder

**For Fluoride Levels:**
**"1-3-10 Rule"**
*   **1.5:** Teeth marks (Dental)
*   **3.0:** Bone sparks (Skeletal starts)
*   **10.0:** Crippling darks (Crippling fluorosis)

---

### **Clinical Relevance**

*   **Differential Diagnosis:** Dental fluorosis must be differentiated from enamel hypoplasia due to other causes (like tetracycline staining). Fluorosis is usually bilateral and symmetrical.
*   **Public Health:** In areas with high fluoride, **defluoridation** is a level of **primary prevention** (specific protection). Conversely, in areas with low fluoride (<0.5 mg/L), **fluoridation** is done to prevent dental caries.
