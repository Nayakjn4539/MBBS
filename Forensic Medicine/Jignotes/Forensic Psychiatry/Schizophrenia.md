# [[Forensic Psychiatry]] > Schizophrenia

### Schizophrenia

**Schizophrenia** is a severe functional psychosis characterized by a disintegration of the process of thinking, contact with reality, and emotional responsiveness. It is primarily a disorder of **cognition** (thinking). The term was coined by **Eugen Bleuler** (1911), meaning "Split Mind" (*Schizo* = Split; *Phren* = Mind).

### Clinical Features

The clinical presentation is complex and is often categorized into fundamental symptoms (Bleuler's) and diagnostic symptoms (Schneider's).

#### 1. Bleuler's Fundamental Symptoms (The 4 A's)
*   **[[Associational Disturbance]] (Loosening of Associations):** Loss of logical connection between thoughts.
*   **[[Affective Disturbance]]:** Inappropriate, blunted, or flattened affect.
*   **[[Ambivalence]]:** Coexistence of contradictory feelings or attitudes towards the same object/person.
*   **[[Autism]]:** Withdrawal from reality into an inner world of fantasy.

#### 2. Schneider's First Rank Symptoms (SFRS)
These are considered pathognomonic for diagnosis.
*   **Auditory Hallucinations:**
    *   Hearing thoughts spoken aloud (Audible thoughts).
    *   Voices arguing or discussing the patient in the third person.
    *   Voices commenting on the patient's actions (Running commentary).
*   **Thought Disorders:**
    *   **Thought Insertion:** Thoughts put into mind by external agency.
    *   **Thought Withdrawal:** Thoughts taken out of mind.
    *   **Thought Broadcasting:** Thoughts escaping to others.
*   **Somatic Passivity:** Sensations or bodily movements controlled by external influences.
*   **Delusional Perception:** Attribution of a new, often ominous meaning to a normal perception (e.g., a traffic light turning red means the world is ending).

**Mnemonic for First Rank Symptoms: ABCD**
*   **A**uditory Hallucinations
*   **B**roadcasting of thought
*   **C**ontrolled thought (insertion/withdrawal)
*   **D**elusional perception

#### 3. Other Symptoms
*   **[[Delusions]]:** Fixed false beliefs (Persecution, Grandeur, Reference, Control).
*   **Disorders of Speech:**
    *   **[[Neologism]]:** Coining new words with private meaning.
    *   **Echolalia:** Repetition of words spoken by others.
    *   **Verbigeration:** Meaningless repetition of words/phrases.
*   **Negative Symptoms:** Apathy, avolition (lack of drive), anhedonia, alogia (poverty of speech).

### Clinical Types of Schizophrenia

| Type | Key Features | Prognosis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Paranoid** | Characterized by persistent **delusions** (persecution, grandeur, jealousy) and hallucinations. Personality is relatively preserved. **Most common type in homicidal crimes.** | Better than hebephrenic |
| **Hebephrenic** (Disorganized) | Early onset. Characterized by **silly behavior**, giggling, grimacing, mirror-gazing, and incoherent speech. | Poor (Worst prognosis) |
| **Catatonic** | Predominant motor disturbances. Can be **Stupor** (mutism, negativity, waxy flexibility) or **Excitement** (violent, destructive behavior). | Fair |
| **Simple** | Insidious onset. Characterized by **negative symptoms** (apathy, social withdrawal, decline in performance). Delusions/hallucinations are usually absent. Hard to diagnose. | Poor |
| **Residual** | Chronic stage with mainly negative symptoms after an active psychotic episode. | Variable |

### Medicolegal Aspects

Schizophrenia is the most important mental disorder in forensic psychiatry due to its association with criminal responsibility and civil rights.

#### 1. Criminal Responsibility (Sections 84 IPC / McNaughten's Rule)
*   **Legal Insanity:** Mere presence of schizophrenia does not exempt a person from punishment. It must be proved that at the time of the crime, the defect of reason was such that the accused did not know the **nature and quality of the act** or that it was **wrong/contrary to law**.
*   **Cognitive vs. Volitional:** The law recognizes impairment of cognitive faculties (understanding), not just emotional/volitional impairment.
*   **[[Paranoid Schizophrenia]]:** This type is most frequently associated with violent crimes, including homicide.

**Characteristics of Homicide by a Schizophrenic:**
*   **No Motive:** Crime is often motiveless or based on a delusion.
*   **No Accomplice:** Usually acts alone.
*   **No Planning:** The act is impulsive and unpremeditated.
*   **No Concealment:** Does not try to hide the body or destroy evidence.
*   **Victim:** Often a stranger or a close family member (e.g., attacking a "persecutor").

#### 2. Civil Responsibilities
*   **[[Testamentary Capacity]] (Making a Will):** A schizophrenic can make a valid will during a **[[Lucid Interval]]**, provided they understand the nature of the property, the beneficiaries, and are free from delusions affecting the disposal of property.
*   **Marriage:** Can be a ground for nullity or divorce if the illness was present at the time of marriage (and concealed) or is incurable/continuous.
*   **Witness:** Can stand as a witness if the court is satisfied they understand the questions and the obligation to speak the truth (during lucid intervals).

#### 3. Management in Custody
*   **Fitness to Plead:** An accused with active schizophrenia may be found unfit to stand trial if they cannot understand the proceedings or instruct their counsel.
*   **Treatment:** Antipsychotic medication (e.g., Chlorpromazine, Haloperidol, Olanzapine). ECT is prohibited without anesthesia and muscle relaxants.
