# [[Clinical Examination]] > Examination of Elbow

### Examination of the Elbow

The clinical examination of the [[elbow joint]] follows the standard orthopedic sequence: **Look, Feel, Move**, followed by special tests to evaluate specific pathologies like tendinitis or nerve entrapment.

### 1. Inspection (Look)
The elbow must be fully exposed. The examination is best performed with the patient standing or sitting, comparing the affected side with the normal side.

**A. Deformity and Attitude**
*   **Carrying Angle:** With the elbow fully extended and the forearm supinated, the arm and forearm do not lie in a straight line. The forearm diverges laterally.
    *   **Normal Valgus:** 5°–15° (usually greater in females).
    *   **[[Cubitus Valgus]]:** An increase in the carrying angle.
    *   **[[Cubitus Varus]] (Gunstock Deformity):** A decrease in the carrying angle or reversal (varus). This is a common complication of malunited [[supracondylar fracture]] of the humerus.
*   **Swelling:** Look for diffuse swelling (synovitis or effusion) or localized swelling (e.g., [[olecranon bursitis]] or "student's elbow").
*   **Skin:** Check for scars, sinuses, or redness (inflammation/infection).
*   **Muscle Wasting:** Inspect the arm (biceps/triceps) and forearm muscles for atrophy.

### 2. Palpation (Feel)
Palpation confirms findings from inspection and identifies specific anatomical landmarks.

*   **Temperature:** Check for local rise in temperature using the back of the fingers, indicative of inflammation or infection.
*   **Tenderness:** Localize the point of maximum tenderness.
    *   **[[Lateral Epicondyle]]:** Tenderness suggests tennis elbow.
    *   **[[Medial Epicondyle]]:** Tenderness suggests golfer's elbow.
    *   **[[Olecranon]]:** Tenderness may indicate bursitis or fracture.
*   **Three Bony Point Relationship:** This is crucial for differentiating between fractures and dislocations. The three points are the tip of the [[olecranon]], the [[medial epicondyle]], and the [[lateral epicondyle]].
    *   **In Extension:** These three points lie in a **straight horizontal line**.
    *   **In 90° Flexion:** These three points form an **isosceles triangle** (equilateral triangle).

**Clinical Implication:**
| Condition | Three Bony Point Relationship |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Supracondylar Fracture]]** | Relationship is **maintained** (Triangle/Line is normal, but shifting relative to the shaft). |
| **[[Elbow Dislocation]]** | Relationship is **disturbed** (The triangle is distorted). |

### 3. Movement (Move)
Test active movements first, followed by passive movements. Measure the range using a [[goniometer]].

*   **Flexion and Extension:**
    *   Normal Range: 0° (full extension) to approximately 145° (full flexion).
*   **Pronation and Supination:**
    *   Tested with the elbow flexed at 90° and held close to the waist to eliminate shoulder rotation.
    *   **Supination:** Palm turning upwards.
    *   **Pronation:** Palm turning downwards.

### 4. Special Tests
These tests are designed to provoke symptoms to diagnose specific tendon or nerve pathologies.

#### A. Tests for [[Lateral Epicondylitis]] (Tennis Elbow)
Pathology involves the common extensor origin (specifically [[Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis]]).

1.  **[[Cozen's Test]]**:
    *   **Procedure:** Ask the patient to make a tight fist with the forearm in pronation. Stabilize the patient's forearm. Ask the patient to dorsiflex (extend) the wrist against your resistance.
    *   **Positive Sign:** Severe pain at the [[lateral epicondyle]].
2.  **Wringing Test**:
    *   **Procedure:** Ask the patient to wring a towel.
    *   **Positive Sign:** Pain is felt at the lateral epicondyle.

#### B. Tests for [[Medial Epicondylitis]] (Golfer's Elbow)
Pathology involves the common flexor origin.

1.  **Reverse Cozen's Test**:
    *   **Procedure:** The patient is asked to flex the wrist against resistance while the forearm is supinated (or neutral) and the elbow is extended.
    *   **Positive Sign:** Pain at the [[medial epicondyle]].

#### C. Neurological Tests
1.  **[[Tinel's Sign]] (For Ulnar Nerve)**:
    *   **Procedure:** Lightly tap (percuss) over the [[ulnar nerve]] in the groove behind the medial epicondyle.
    *   **Positive Sign:** A tingling sensation (paresthesia) radiating down the forearm into the little and ring fingers indicates nerve irritability or regeneration (neuroma).
2.  **Ulnar Nerve Instability**:
    *   **Procedure:** Palpate the ulnar nerve behind the medial epicondyle while flexing and extending the elbow.
    *   **Positive Sign:** The nerve slips anteriorly over the epicondyle (subluxation), often causing a "snap" or tingling.
