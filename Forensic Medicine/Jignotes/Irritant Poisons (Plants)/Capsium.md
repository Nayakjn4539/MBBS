### [[Capsicum]] (Chillies / Red Pepper)

**Botanical Name:** *[[Capsicum annuum]]* or *[[Capsicum frutescens]]*
**Family:** Solanaceae
**Common Names:** Chilly, Mirchi, Lal Mirchi, Red pepper, Cayenne pepper.

*   [[Capsicin]]
*   Dihydrocapsaicin
*   Capsicutin

**Action:**
*   It is a powerful **irritant**.
*   It depletes **Substance P** from nerve terminals, causing initial intense excitation of sensory nerve endings (burning pain) followed by a period of relative insensitivity (desensitization).

    *   **Color:** Pale yellow.
    *   **Smell:** Pungent.

#### Clinical Features
**1. Local Application (Skin/Mucosa):**
*   **Burning sensation** and redness.
*   **Vesication:** Formation of blisters if applied for a long time.
*   Lacrimation and rhinorrhea if eyes/nose are exposed.

**2. Ingestion:**
*   **Mouth:** Intense burning sensation in the mouth, throat, and stomach.
*   **GIT:** Salivation, vomiting, abdominal colic, tenesmus, and severe purging (diarrhea).
*   **Urinary:** Dysuria, oliguria, and occasionally nephritis.
*   **General:** Tachycardia, dyspnea, vertigo, and collapse in severe cases.

**3. Inhalation:**
*   Intense irritation of the respiratory tract.
*   Sneezing, coughing, and dyspnea.

**4. Specific Syndrome:**
*   **[[Hunan Hand Syndrome]]:** A form of contact dermatitis seen in workers handling chili peppers, characterized by burning, erythema, and desquamation of the skin.

#### Fatal Dose and Period
*   **Fatal Dose:** Uncertain (Not usually fatal).
*   **Fatal Period:** Uncertain (12–24 hours).

---

#### Treatment
**1. Skin Contact:**
*   Wash the affected area with **vinegar**, **vegetable oil**, or **ice-cold water**.
*   Topical analgesics or steroid creams for dermatitis.

**2. Eye Contact:**
*   Copious irrigation with saline or water.
*   Topical anesthetics and antibiotics.

**3. Ingestion:**
*   **Demulcents:** Milk, egg white, butter, or oil to soothe the mucosa.
*   **Gastric Lavage:** With warm water (if large quantity ingested).
*   **Cold:** Sucking ice cubes or sipping ice-cold water.
*   **Symptomatic:** Morphine/Analgesics for pain and treatment for diarrhea/shock.

---

#### Postmortem Findings
*   Findings are generally non-specific.
*   **GIT:** Acute inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Stomach mucosa may show **congestion** and **ulcerated patches**.

#### Medicolegal Aspects
1.  **Robbery:** Chilly powder is thrown into the eyes of victims to incapacitate them temporarily to facilitate robbery.

    *   Rubbing powder on sensitive parts like female breasts.

4.  **Accidental Poisoning:** Mistaken identity between *Datura* seeds and *Capsicum* seeds.
5.  **Malingering:** Used to produce **[[artificial bruises]]** to level false charges of assault.
