# [[DEMOGRAPHY AND FAMILY PLANNING]] > Define "sex ratio". What are the factors behind declining sex ratio in India? What are the measures adopted to correct the situation?

### Definition of Sex Ratio

[[Sex Ratio]] is defined as the number of **females per 1000 males** in a population.
*   It is a basic demographic characteristic used to analyze the sex composition of a population.
*   **Formula:**
    $$Sex Ratio = \frac{\text{Number of Females}}{\text{Number of Males}} \times 1000$$

**Note:** In India, it is expressed as females per 1000 males, whereas internationally, it is often expressed as males per 100 females.

**Current Status in India (Census 2011):**
*   **Overall Sex Ratio:** 940 females per 1000 males.
*   **[[Child Sex Ratio]] (0-6 years):** 914 girls per 1000 boys (This is considered highly unfavorable and alarming).
*   **Kerala** has the highest sex ratio (1084), while **Haryana** has the lowest (877) among states.

### Factors Behind Declining Sex Ratio in India

The decline, often termed as **"Female Deficit Syndrome"**, is attributed to a complex interplay of social, cultural, and medical factors:

**1. Social and Cultural Factors (The "Son Preference")**
*   **Strong Male Child Preference:** Sons are seen as assets for old-age security, carrying the family name, and performing funeral rites, while daughters are viewed as liabilities due to marriage costs.
*   **Dowry System:** The financial burden associated with a daughter's marriage discourages parents from raising female children.
*   **Neglect of the Girl Child:** Female infants often receive less attention regarding nutrition and healthcare compared to males, leading to higher female infant mortality.

**2. Medical and Technological Factors**
*   **[[Female Foeticide]]:** Misuse of pre-natal diagnostic techniques (Ultrasound/Amniocentesis) for sex determination followed by sex-selective abortion.
*   **Female Infanticide:** The deliberate killing of female infants soon after birth, still prevalent in some parts of the country.
*   **High [[Maternal Mortality Ratio]] (MMR):** High death rates among women during reproductive age (15–34 years) due to childbirth complications reduce the overall female population.

**3. Enumeration Issues**
*   **Male Bias in Enumeration:** There is often under-counting of females during the census due to social prejudices.

**4. Migration**
*   **Sex-Selective Migration:** In urban areas, the sex ratio may appear skewed due to the migration of males from rural areas for employment.

**Mnemonic for Causes: "FEMALE"**
*   **F**oeticide (Sex-selective abortion)
*   **E**arly Marriage & Childbearing
*   **M**aternal Mortality (High)
*   **A**ccess to Diagnostic techniques (Misuse)
*   **L**iteracy (Low female literacy)
*   **E**conomic burden (Dowry)

### Measures Adopted to Correct the Situation

The Government of India has implemented a multi-pronged strategy involving legislation, social welfare, and awareness.

#### 1. Legislative Measures
*   **[[PCPNDT Act]] (Pre-conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques Act, 1994):**
    *   Bans the use of sex selection techniques before or after conception.
    *   Regulates the use of pre-natal diagnostic techniques (like USG) only for detecting genetic abnormalities, not for sex determination.
    *   Punishment involves imprisonment and fines for violations.
*   **[[MTP Act]] (Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971):** Regulates abortion services to prevent illegal and unsafe abortions, though it is often misused for sex-selective abortions despite legal prohibitions.
*   **Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006:** Replaced the Child Marriage Restraint Act to prohibit early marriages, reducing high-risk teenage pregnancies.
*   **Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961:** To reduce the economic burden associated with daughters.

#### 2. Social and Educational Measures
*   **[[Beti Bachao Beti Padhao]] (BBBP):** A flagship campaign to prevent gender-biased sex selective elimination, ensure survival and protection of the girl child, and ensure education of the girl child.
*   **Empowerment of Women:** Promoting female literacy and employment to raise the status of women in society.
*   **Advocacy:** Using ASHA and Anganwadi workers to counsel families against gender discrimination.

#### 3. Welfare Schemes and Incentives
*   **Balika Samridhi Yojana:** Cash incentives are awarded at the birth of a girl child (up to two children) to promote their survival and care.
*   **Maternity Benefit Schemes:** Cash incentives (e.g., [[Janani Suraksha Yojana]]) linked to institutional deliveries and registration, which helps in tracking births and reducing infanticide.
*   **Cradle Baby Scheme:** Setting up cradles at health centers/orphanages to receive abandoned female babies to prevent infanticide.

#### 4. Technological Monitoring
*   Strict monitoring of ultrasound clinics and tracking of pregnant women (e.g., Mother and Child Tracking System) to prevent sex determination.
