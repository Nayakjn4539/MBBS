# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Drug supply for management of paediatric TB under RNTCP

### Drug Supply for Management of Paediatric TB under RNTCP/NTEP

Under the [[National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme]] (NTEP), formerly known as RNTCP, the management of paediatric tuberculosis has undergone a significant shift from intermittent therapy to a **daily regimen**. The drug supply mechanism is designed to ensure adherence, correct dosing, and palatability for children.

#### 1. Key Features of Drug Supply
*   **Daily Regimen:** Treatment is administered daily using **Fixed Dose Combinations (FDCs)**.
*   **Child-Friendly Formulations:** The tablets provided are **dispersible** and **flavoured** (usually fruit-flavoured). This replaces the older, bitter tablets that were difficult for children to swallow.
*   **Patient-Wise Boxes (PWB):** India is the first country to introduce paediatric patient-wise boxes. These boxes contain the **complete course** of anti-TB drugs for a specific patient, ensuring uninterrupted supply.
*   **Weight-Based Dosing:** Drug supply is categorized into **Six Weight Bands** to ensure accurate dosage without complex calculations.

#### 2. Drug Formulations Available
The programme provides specific strengths of FDCs and loose tablets for children:

| **Type** | **Composition per Tablet** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Dispersible FDC (3-Drug)** | **Rifampicin (75 mg)** + **Isoniazid (50 mg)** + **Pyrazinamide (150 mg)** |
| **Dispersible FDC (2-Drug)** | **Rifampicin (75 mg)** + **Isoniazid (50 mg)** |
| **Dispersible Loose Drug** | **Ethambutol (100 mg)** |
| **Dispersible Loose Drug** | **Isoniazid (100 mg)** |

*   **Adolescents:** Adolescents up to 18 years weighing **< 39 kg** are treated using paediatric weight bands. Those weighing **> 39 kg** are treated using adult weight bands.

#### 3. Dosage Schedule by Weight Bands
The number of tablets (FDCs and loose Ethambutol) administered daily during the **Intensive Phase (IP)** and **Continuation Phase (CP)** is determined by the child's weight.

**Table: Number of Tablets (Dispersible FDCs) per Weight Band**

| **Weight Category** | **Intensive Phase (IP)** | **Continuation Phase (CP)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **(Daily Dosing)** | **HRZ** (FDC) + **E** (Loose) | **HR** (FDC) + **E** (Loose) |
| **4–7 kg** | 1 + 1 | 1 + 1 |
| **8–11 kg** | 2 + 2 | 2 + 2 |
| **12–15 kg** | 3 + 3 | 3 + 3 |
| **16–24 kg** | 4 + 4 | 4 + 4 |
| **25–29 kg** | 3 + 1 A* + 3 | 3 + 1 A* + 3 |
| **30–39 kg** | 2 + 2 A* + 2 | 2 + 2 A* + 2 |

***Note:** "A" refers to **Adult FDC** tablets. For children >25 kg, Adult FDCs are added because the pill burden of paediatric tablets becomes too high, and these children can usually swallow tablets.*

#### 4. Clinical Relevance & Administration
*   **Directly Observed Treatment (DOT):** An option for family members (e.g., mother/father) to act as the DOT provider has been incorporated for paediatric patients to ensure compliance.
*   **Weight Gain:** If a child gains weight and crosses into the next weight band during treatment, the dosage should be adjusted to the next higher band immediately.
*   **Supplements:** **Pyridoxine** (Vitamin B6) supplementation (10 mg/day) is recommended for all children receiving Isoniazid-containing therapy to prevent neuropathy.
*   **Strategy:** The transition to daily FDCs aims to reduce the pill burden, prevent "concealed" irregularity (hiding tablets), and minimize the risk of drug resistance.

### 💡 Mnemonic for First-Line Drugs
**RIPE** grapes are sweet for children (Fruit flavoured FDCs):
*   **R** - Rifampicin
*   **I** - Isoniazid
*   **P** - Pyrazinamide
*   **E** - Ethambutol

**(Note: Streptomycin is generally avoided in children unless specific indications exist due to ototoxicity).**
