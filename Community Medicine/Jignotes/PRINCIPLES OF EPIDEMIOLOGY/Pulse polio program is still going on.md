# [[PRINCIPLES OF EPIDEMIOLOGY]] > Pulse polio program is still going on

### **Pulse Polio Programme: Status and Rationale**

The statement is **Correct**. Despite India being certified **Polio Free** on 27th March 2014, the [[Pulse Polio Immunization]] (PPI) program continues,. This is essential to maintain the "polio-free" status and prevent the re-emergence or importation of the wild poliovirus from neighboring endemic countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan.

#### **1. Concept of "Pulse" Polio**
*   **Definition:** It involves the **sudden, simultaneous, mass administration** of [[Oral Polio Vaccine]] (OPV) on a single day to **all children 0–5 years of age**, regardless of their previous immunization status.
*   **Why "Pulse"?:** The term "Pulse" describes the method of saturating the community with the vaccine virus simultaneously.
*   **Supplementation:** These doses are **"over and above"** the routine immunization schedule; they do not replace the routine doses,.

#### **2. Core Objective**
The primary aim is to break the chain of transmission. By flooding the community with the vaccine virus, the wild poliovirus is effectively "replaced" by the harmless vaccine virus in the environment,.

#### **3. Operational Strategy**
The program operates during the **low transmission season** (typically November to February).

| **Activity** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NIDs (National Immunization Days)** | Two rounds conducted approx. 4–6 weeks apart covering the **entire country**,. |
| **SNIDs (Sub-National Immunization Days)** | Conducted in specific **high-risk states** or areas (e.g., UP, Bihar) to maintain high immunity levels,. |
| **Mop-up Rounds** | Involves door-to-door immunization in specific high-risk districts where wild virus circulation is suspected. |
| **Booth + House-to-House** | Children are vaccinated at fixed booths on the first day (Sunday), followed by house-to-house searches (2–3 days) to cover missed children. |

#### **4. The "Endgame" Strategy & The Switch**
To eliminate the risk of [[Vaccine Derived Polio Virus]] (VDPV), the program has evolved:
*   **The Switch (April 2016):** A globally synchronized switch was made from **Trivalent OPV (tOPV)** to **Bivalent OPV (bOPV)**.
    *   **Reason:** Type 2 Wild Poliovirus has been eradicated; continued use of tOPV (containing Type 2) posed a risk of VDPV.
*   **IPV Introduction:** At least one dose of [[Inactivated Polio Vaccine]] (IPV) was introduced into routine immunization to maintain immunity against Type 2.

#### **5. Surveillance: The Backbone**
The program is supported by a robust surveillance system, specifically for **Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP)**.
*   **Criteria:** Any child <15 years with acute onset of floppiness/weakness is investigated.
*   **Protocol:** Stool samples must be collected within **14 days** of paralysis onset.
*   **Reverse Cold Chain:** Samples are transported to the lab at +2°C to +8°C.

### **Mnemonic: PULSE** (To remember the Strategy)

*   **P** - **Populations** at risk targeted (0-5 years).
*   **U** - **Universal** coverage (NIDs and SNIDs).
*   **L** - **Low** transmission season utilized (Winter).
*   **S** - **Simultaneous** administration (Single day).
*   **E** - **Extra** doses (Supplementary to routine immunization).
