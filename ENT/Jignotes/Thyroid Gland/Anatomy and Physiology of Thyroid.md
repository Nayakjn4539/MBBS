# Anatomy and Physiology of the Thyroid Gland

## **I. Embryology**

The thyroid gland is the first endocrine gland to appear during embryonic development.

*   **Origin:** It develops as a **midline diverticulum** from the endoderm of the floor of the primitive pharynx (foregut),.
*   **Site:** The origin point is indicated by the [[foramen cecum]], located between the tuberculum impar and the copula of the tongue,.
*   **Descent:** The [[thyroglossal duct]] grows caudally, passing anterior to the hyoid bone and larynx to reach its final position in the anterior neck. The duct normally obliterates and atrophies,.
*   **Timeline:** Appearance begins in the 3rd to 4th week of fetal life,.
*   **Contribution of 4th Pouch:** The [[ultimobranchial body]] (from the 4th pharyngeal pouch) fuses with the thyroid lobes, giving rise to the **Parafollicular C-cells** (calcitonin-secreting cells),,.

**Clinical Implications:**
*   **[[Thyroglossal Duct Cyst]]:** Failure of the duct to obliterate can lead to a cystic midline swelling that moves with tongue protrusion and swallowing,,.
*   **[[Lingual Thyroid]]:** Failure of descent results in ectopic thyroid tissue at the base of the tongue, which may be the only functioning thyroid tissue in the body,,.
*   **[[Pyramidal Lobe]]:** A remnant of the distal thyroglossal duct, often seen projecting upward from the isthmus, usually on the left side,.

## **II. Surgical Anatomy**

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Anatomy of the thyroid gland showing lobes, isthmus, pyramidal lobe, and vascular supply

### **1. Gross Structure**
*   **Shape:** Butterfly-shaped, highly vascular organ,.
*   **Weight:** Approximately 15–25 g in adults,.
*   **Location:** Situated deep to the strap muscles (sternohyoid and sternothyroid) in the anterior neck,.
*   **Parts:**
    *   **Lateral Lobes:** Extend from the middle of the [[thyroid cartilage]] to the 6th tracheal ring.
    *   **Isthmus:** Connects the lower parts of the lobes; overlies the **2nd, 3rd, and 4th tracheal rings**,.
    *   **Pyramidal Lobe:** Present in some individuals, extending superiorly from the isthmus.

### **2. Capsules**
The gland is invested by two capsules:
1.  **True Capsule:** A peripheral condensation of the gland's connective tissue. A dense capillary plexus lies deep to this capsule,.
2.  **False Capsule (Surgical Capsule):** Derived from the pretracheal layer of the [[deep cervical fascia]]. It ensheaths the gland and attaches it to the larynx and trachea,,.

### **3. Ligaments**
*   **[[Ligament of Berry]] (Posterior Suspensory Ligament):**
    *   A condensation of the pretracheal fascia connecting the posteromedial aspect of the thyroid lobes to the [[cricoid cartilage]] and first two tracheal rings,,.
    *   **Clinical Significance:** This attachment causes the thyroid to move up with deglutition. It is a critical landmark as the **[[Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve]] (RLN)** often passes deep to or through this ligament. Careless dissection here causes nerve injury,,.

### **4. Relations**
*   **Anterior:** [[Strap muscles]] (sternohyoid, sternothyroid, omohyoid) and [[sternocleidomastoid muscle]],.
*   **Posterior:** Larynx, trachea, pharynx, and esophagus,.
*   **Lateral:** [[Carotid sheath]] (containing the common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and vagus nerve),.
*   **Medial:** [[Trachea]], [[Esophagus]], [[Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve]], and [[External Laryngeal Nerve]].

## **III. Blood Supply**

The thyroid is extremely vascular, with a flow rate of 5 mL/g/minute.

### **1. Arterial Supply**
| Artery | Origin | Relation/Course | Clinical Relevance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Superior Thyroid Artery]]** | First branch of **External Carotid Artery**. | Descends to the upper pole. Closely related to the **External Laryngeal Nerve (ELN)**,. | Ligate close to the gland apex to avoid ELN injury (nerve of Galli-Curci),. |
| **[[Inferior Thyroid Artery]]** | **Thyrocervical Trunk** (Subclavian Artery). | Ascends behind the carotid sheath to the posterior border of the lobe. Supplies [[parathyroid glands]],. | Ligate far from the gland to avoid **Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve (RLN)** injury and preserve parathyroid blood supply,. |
| **[[Thyroidea Ima Artery]]** | Aortic arch or Innominate artery (inconstant, ~10%),. | Ascends on the anterior surface of the trachea to the isthmus. | Can cause severe bleeding during tracheostomy or thyroidectomy if not identified. |

### **2. Venous Drainage**
*   **[[Superior Thyroid Vein]]:** Drains into the **Internal Jugular Vein (IJV)**,.
*   **[[Middle Thyroid Vein]]:** Short, variable vein; drains directly into the **IJV**. Must be carefully ligated to mobilize the gland,,.
*   **[[Inferior Thyroid Vein]]:** Multiple veins form a plexus; drain into the **Brachiocephalic Veins**,,.
*   **Kocher’s Vein:** A rare 4th vein found between the middle and inferior veins.

## **IV. Nerve Supply**

### **1. Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve (RLN)**
*   **Origin:** Branch of the [[Vagus nerve]] (CN X).
*   **Course:**
    *   **Right:** Loops around the right subclavian artery,.
    *   **Left:** Loops around the arch of the aorta (longer course),.
    *   Ascends in the **tracheoesophageal groove** to enter the larynx behind the [[cricothyroid joint]],.
*   **Relation:** Closely related to the **[[Inferior Thyroid Artery]]** (can pass anterior, posterior, or between branches) and the **Ligament of Berry**,.
*   **Function:** Supplies all intrinsic laryngeal muscles *except* the cricothyroid; provides sensation below the vocal cords,.

### **2. Superior Laryngeal Nerve (SLN)**
*   **External Branch (ELN):** Runs deep to the superior thyroid artery in **Joll's Triangle** to supply the **[[Cricothyroid muscle]]** (tensor of the vocal cord),,.
*   **Internal Branch:** Purely sensory to the supraglottis.

**Surgical Triangles for Nerve Identification:**

| Triangle | Boundaries | Content |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Joll’s Triangle]]** (Sternothyrolaryngeal) | **Lateral:** Upper pole/vessels<br>**Superior:** Sternothyroid insertion<br>**Medial:** Midline | Contains the **External Laryngeal Nerve**. |
| **[[Beahr’s Triangle]]** | **Medial:** Trachea/Esophagus (RLN)<br>**Lateral:** Carotid sheath<br>**Superior:** Inferior thyroid artery | Used to locate the **Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve**,. |

## **V. Lymphatic Drainage**

*   **Major Drainage:** To the Deep Cervical Nodes:
    *   **Level III:** Middle jugular nodes.
    *   **Level IV:** Lower jugular nodes.
    *   **Level V:** Posterior triangle nodes.
*   **Minor Drainage (Central Compartment):**
    *   **Level VI:** Prelaryngeal ([[Delphian node]]), Pretracheal, and Paratracheal nodes,.
    *   **Level VII:** Superior mediastinal nodes.

## **VI. Physiology**

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Thyroid Axis and Hormone Synthesis

The thyroid is an endocrine gland with two distinct functional units.

### **1. Thyroid Follicles (Thyrocytes)**
*   **Function:** Synthesize **T3 (Tri-iodothyronine)** and **T4 (Thyroxine)**.
*   **Synthesis Steps:**
    1.  **Active Uptake:** Iodide trapping by the gland.
    2.  **Oxidation:** Iodide is oxidized to iodine by **[[Thyroid Peroxidase]] (TPO)**,.
    3.  **Organification:** Iodine binds to tyrosine on thyroglobulin to form Monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and Diiodotyrosine (DIT).
    4.  **Coupling:** MIT + DIT = **T3**; DIT + DIT = **T4**.
    5.  **Storage:** Stored as colloid (thyroglobulin) in the lumen.
    6.  **Release:** Proteolysis releases free T3 and T4 into circulation.
*   **Regulation:** Controlled by **[[TSH]]** (Pituitary), which is regulated by **TRH** (Hypothalamus) via a negative feedback loop,.
*   **Action:** Increases basal metabolic rate, heat production, growth, and sensitivity to catecholamines.

### **2. Parafollicular Cells (C-Cells)**
*   **Location:** Situated between the follicles.
*   **Function:** Secrete **[[Calcitonin]]**,.
*   **Action:** Lowers serum calcium by inhibiting osteoclast activity (antagonist to Parathyroid Hormone),.
*   **Clinical:** Marker for **[[Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma]]**,.

**Funny Mnemonic for Thyroid Hormones:**
*"T4 is the tortoise (slow acting, long half-life, abundant), T3 is the hare (fast acting, potent, short half-life)."*
