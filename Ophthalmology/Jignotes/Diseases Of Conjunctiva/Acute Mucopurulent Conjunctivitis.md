# [[Diseases Of Conjunctiva]] > Acute Mucopurulent Conjunctivitis

# Acute Mucopurulent Conjunctivitis

**Synonyms:** Acute Catarrhal Conjunctivitis, "Pink Eye"

It is the most common type of [[acute bacterial conjunctivitis]] characterized by marked conjunctival hyperemia and mucopurulent discharge from the eye.

### Etiology

**Causative Organisms**
*   **[[Staphylococcus aureus]]:** The most common cause worldwide and in bacterial conjunctivitis in general.
*   **[[Haemophilus aegyptius]] (Koch-Weeks bacillus):** Associated with epidemics of "Red Eye," especially in semi-tropical climates.
*   **[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]] (Pneumococcus):** Associated with petechial subconjunctival hemorrhages; often self-limiting.
*   **[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]:** May produce pseudomembranous conjunctivitis.
*   **Moraxella lacunata:** Usually causes angular conjunctivitis but can cause generalized mucopurulent infection.

**Predisposing Factors**
*   Hot, dry climate.
*   Poor sanitation and hygiene.
*   Flies (vectors).
*   Fomites (soiled towels, handkerchiefs).

**Mode of Infection**
*   **Exogenous (Most common):** Direct contact, airborne, waterborne, or material transfer (fingers, fomites).
*   **Local Spread:** From infected lacrimal sac ([[dacryocystitis]]), lids, or nasopharynx.
*   **Endogenous:** Rare spread via blood.

### Pathology

The inflammatory response consists of three phases:
1.  **Vascular Response:** Congestion and increased permeability of conjunctival vessels.
2.  **Cellular Response:** Exudation of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) into the substantia propria and conjunctival sac.
3.  **Tissue Response:** Edema of conjunctiva, degeneration of superficial epithelial cells, and proliferation of mucus-secreting [[goblet cells]].

### Clinical Features

#### Symptoms
*   **Discomfort/Foreign Body Sensation:** Grittiness, feeling of "sand in the eye".
*   **Sticking of Lids:** Especially upon waking in the morning due to accumulation of discharge during sleep.
*   **Discharge:** Mucopurulent in nature.
*   **Redness:** Sudden onset.
*   **Photophobia:** Usually mild (difficulty tolerating light).
*   **Colored Halos:** Patients may complain of halos around lights due to the prismatic effect of mucus flakes on the [[cornea]].

#### Signs
*   **Congestion:** "Fiery red eye". Hyperemia is maximum in the fornices and palpebral conjunctiva and less towards the limbus (superficial congestion).
*   **Discharge:** Flakes of mucopus seen in fornices, canthi, and lid margins. Cilia are matted with yellow crusts.
*   **[[Chemosis]]:** Swelling of the conjunctiva.
*   **Petechial Hemorrhages:** Typically seen in pneumococcal infections.
*   **Papillary Reaction:** Mild fine papillae may be seen on the palpebral conjunctiva.

### Clinical Course
*   Usually bilateral (one eye may be affected 1–2 days before the other).
*   Reaches height in 3–4 days.
*   **Untreated:** May resolve in 10–15 days or become chronic.
*   **Treated:** Resolves rapidly.

### Complications
Though usually benign, untreated cases may lead to:
*   **[[Marginal Corneal Ulcer]]:** Hypersensitivity reaction to S. aureus toxins.
*   **Superficial Punctate Keratitis (SPK).**
*   **Blepharitis.**
*   **Dacryocystitis.**

### Differential Diagnosis

It is crucial to differentiate acute conjunctivitis from other causes of a "Red Eye" such as Acute [[Iridocyclitis]] and Acute Congestive [[Glaucoma]].

| Feature | Acute Conjunctivitis | Acute Iridocyclitis | Acute Congestive Glaucoma |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pain** | Mild discomfort/grittiness | Moderate, radiating | Severe, radiating (with nausea/vomiting) |
| **Discharge** | **Mucopurulent/Purulent** | Watery | Watery |
| **Vision** | Normal (or transient blurring due to mucus) | Slightly impaired | Markedly impaired |
| **Congestion** | **Superficial (Conjunctival)** | Deep (Ciliary/Circumcorneal) | Deep (Ciliary) |
| **Cornea** | Clear (unless complicated) | KPs present on back | Hazy (steamy) due to edema |
| **Pupil** | Normal size and reaction | **Small, irregular, sluggish** | **Vertically oval, dilated, fixed** |
| **Anterior Chamber** | Normal depth | Normal or deep (plasmoid aqueous) | Very shallow |
| **Intraocular Pressure**| Normal | Normal (usually) | Markedly raised |
| **Constitutional Symptoms**| Absent | Minimal | Prostration, vomiting |

### Management

**1. Curative Treatment (Antibiotics)**
*   **Topical Drops:** Broad-spectrum antibiotics are started empirically while awaiting culture results (if indicated).
    *   [[Chloramphenicol]] (1%)
    *   Gentamicin (0.3%) or Tobramycin (0.3%)
    *   Fluoroquinolones: [[Ciprofloxacin]] (0.3%), [[Moxifloxacin]] (0.5%), [[Gatifloxacin]] (0.3%).
    *   *Dosage:* Instilled every 2–4 hours initially, then tapered.
*   **Eye Ointment:** Applied at bedtime to prevent lid sticking and provide overnight coverage (e.g., Ciprofloxacin or Chloramphenicol ointment).

**2. Supportive Therapy**
*   **Irrigation:** Frequent washing of the conjunctival sac with sterile saline removes deleterious material and discharge. *Note: Frequent washing with water is controversial as it may wash away lysozymes; saline irrigation once or twice a day is preferred.*
*   **Dark Goggles:** To prevent photophobia and reduce glare.
*   **Anti-inflammatory:** Oral analgesics (Ibuprofen/Paracetamol) for pain relief.

**3. Contraindications (What NOT to do)**
*   **NO Bandaging:** Bandaging converts the conjunctival sac into an incubator, raising temperature and promoting bacterial growth. It also prevents the escape of discharge.
*   **NO Steroids:** Steroids should not be used initially as they may flare up the infection or worsen undiagnosed viral/fungal keratitis.

**4. Prevention**
*   Hand washing.
*   Avoid sharing towels, handkerchiefs, or pillows.
*   Isolation of the infected person during the active phase.
