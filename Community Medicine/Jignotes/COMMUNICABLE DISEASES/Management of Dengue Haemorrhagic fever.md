# Management of Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF)

**Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF)** is a severe manifestation of dengue infection characterized by plasma leakage, thrombocytopenia, and haemoconcentration. The management strategy depends heavily on the **severity grading** and the **phase of illness** (Febrile, Critical, or Recovery).

### 1. Assessment and Classification
Before initiating treatment, categorize the patient based on the **WHO grading system**. This determines whether the patient needs home care or intensive hospital management.

| Grade | Clinical Features | Severity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Grade I** | Fever + Non-specific constitutional symptoms + **Positive Tourniquet Test** is the only hemorrhagic manifestation. | DHF (Non-Shock) |
| **Grade II** | Grade I + **Spontaneous bleeding** (skin, gums, GIT, epistaxis). | DHF (Non-Shock) |
| **Grade III** | Circulatory failure: Weak rapid pulse, narrowing pulse pressure (<20 mmHg), hypotension, cold clammy skin, restlessness. | **[[Dengue Shock Syndrome]] (DSS)** |
| **Grade IV** | Profound shock: Undetectable blood pressure or pulse. | **Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS)** |,

### 2. General Management Principles
*   **Notification:** Dengue is a notifiable disease; cases must be reported to health authorities.
*   **Baselines:** Establish baseline **[[Hematocrit]] (Hct)** and platelet count at the first visit.
*   **Avoid NSAIDs:** Do **not** give Acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) or Ibuprofen as they aggravate gastritis/bleeding and may cause Reye's Syndrome.

#### Mnemonic for General Care: **"FLUIDS"**
*   **F**ever control (Paracetamol)
*   **L**iquids (Oral/IV)
*   **U**rine output monitoring
*   **I**sotonic crystalloids (RL/NS)
*   **D**aily Hct/Platelets
*   **S**hock recognition

### 3. Management by Severity

#### A. Management of DHF Grade I and II (Non-Shock)
Patients with thrombocytopenia and hemoconcentration but *without* shock.

**1. Febrile Phase & Home Care:**
*   **Antipyretics:** Give **[[Paracetamol]]** to keep temperature <39°C. Avoid aspirin.
*   **Oral Fluids:** Encourage copious amounts of **[[Oral Rehydration Solution]] (ORS)**, fruit juices, and electrolytes to replace losses,.
*   **Monitoring:** Closely monitor for **warning signs** of shock, especially during the transition from febrile to afebrile stage (usually day 3–5).

**2. Fluid Therapy (If vomiting/refusing feed or rising Hct):**
*   **Initiate IV Therapy:** Start with crystalloid solution (e.g., Ringer's Lactate or Normal Saline) at **6 ml/kg/hour** for 1–2 hours,.
*   **Titration:**
    *   *If Improvement (Hct falls, stable pulse/BP, urine rises):* Reduce flow to **3 ml/kg/hr**. Discontinue after 24–48 hours.
    *   *If No Improvement (Hct rises, pulse rises):* Increase rate to **10 ml/kg/hr**.

#### B. Management of DHF Grade III (Compensated Shock)
This is a medical emergency requiring immediate hospitalization and oxygen support.

*   **Immediate Resuscitation:** Initiate IV therapy with **Crystalloids** at **10–20 ml/kg/hour** for 1 hour.
*   **Response Assessment:**
    *   *Improvement:* Reduce fluids gradually (20 $\to$ 10 $\to$ 6 $\to$ 3 ml/kg/hr).
    *   *No Improvement (Hct rises):* Change to **Colloids** (Dextran 40 or Haemaccel) at 10 ml/kg/hr,.
    *   *No Improvement (Hct falls):* Suspect internal bleeding. Give **Fresh Whole Blood** transfusion (10 ml/kg/hr),.

#### C. Management of DHF Grade IV (Profound Shock)
Patient has undetectable pulse/BP.

*   **Rapid Bolus:** Give **10–20 ml/kg** of crystalloid or colloid as a rapid bolus over 15–30 minutes.
*   **Re-evaluate:** If shock persists, repeat bolus. Once vitals stabilize, switch to the tapering regimen described in Grade III.

### 4. Indications for Blood Products
Routine prophylactic platelet transfusion is **not** recommended.

*   **Red Cell Transfusion:** Indicated if there is overt blood loss (>10% total blood volume) or refractory shock with *declining* hematocrit (indicating internal bleed). Give fresh whole blood (10 ml/kg) or packed cells (5 ml/kg).
*   **Platelet Transfusion:** Only if platelet count is **<10,000/cu.mm** or if there is prolonged shock with coagulopathy/massive systemic bleeding.

### 5. Monitoring Parameters
During the critical phase, monitor the following regularly (every hour in severe cases),:
1.  **Vital Signs:** Pulse, Blood Pressure (specifically pulse pressure).
2.  **Perfusion:** Capillary refill time, warmth of extremities.
3.  **Fluid Status:** Urine output (Goal: 0.5 ml/kg/hr).
4.  **Laboratory:** Serial **[[Haematocrit]]** (Hct) and Platelet counts.
    *   *Clinical Relevance:* A drop in platelets combined with a rise in Hct is the hallmark of the critical plasma leakage phase.

### 6. Discharge Criteria
Patients can be discharged when they meet the following criteria:
*   Absence of fever for at least **24 hours** (without antipyretics).
*   Visible clinical improvement and return of appetite.
*   Good urine output.
*   Minimum 2–3 days after recovery from shock.
*   **Platelet count >50,000/cu.mm.**
*   No respiratory distress from pleural effusion/ascites.
