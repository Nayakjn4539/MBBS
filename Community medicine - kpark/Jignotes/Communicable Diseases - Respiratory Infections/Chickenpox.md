# [[Communicable Diseases - Respiratory Infections]] > Chickenpox

### Chickenpox (Varicella)

**Definition:** An acute, highly infectious disease caused by [[Varicella-Zoster virus]] (V-Z virus). It is characterized by a vesicular rash that may be accompanied by fever and malaise.

---

### **1. Epidemiological Determinants**

**A. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** [[Varicella-Zoster virus]] (Human alpha herpes virus 3).
    *   Primary infection causes Chickenpox.
    *   Reactivation of latent virus causes **Herpes Zoster (Shingles)**.
*   **Source of Infection:** A case of chickenpox or herpes zoster.
*   **Infective Material:** Oropharyngeal secretions and lesions of skin/mucosa.
    *   *Note:* **The scabs are NOT infective**,.
*   **Secondary Attack Rate:** Highly contagious, approx **90%** in susceptible household contacts.

**B. Host Factors**
*   **Age:** Primarily affects children under **10 years**.
*   **Immunity:** One attack gives **durable (lifelong) immunity**. Second attacks are rare.
*   **Pregnancy:** Infection during early pregnancy can lead to **Congenital Varicella Syndrome** (limb atrophy, microcephaly, scarring).

**C. Environmental Factors**
*   **Seasonality:** Shows seasonal trend, peak incidence in winter and spring.

---

### **2. Transmission**

*   **Mode:**
    1.  **Droplet infection** and droplet nuclei.
    2.  Face-to-face personal contact.
    3.  **Transplacental** (vertical transmission).
*   **Portal of Entry:** Respiratory tract.

---

### **3. Timelines**

*   **[[Incubation Period]]:** Usually **14–16 days** (Range 10–21 days).
*   **Period of Communicability:**
    *   **1–2 days before** the appearance of the rash.
    *   **4–5 days after** the appearance of the rash (until lesions crust over).

---

### **4. Clinical Features**

**A. Pre-eruptive Stage (Prodrome)**
*   Brief (24 hours). Mild fever, back pain, shivering, and malaise.

**B. Eruptive Stage (The Rash)**
*   **Appearance:** Symmetrical. First appears on the trunk, then face, arms, and legs.
*   **Evolution:** Rapid evolution through stages: **Macule $\rightarrow$ Papule $\rightarrow$ Vesicle $\rightarrow$ Scab**.
*   **Appearance of Vesicle:** Looks like **"Dew-drop on a rose petal"** (superficial, unilocular, with inflammation around it).
*   **Distribution:** **[[Centripetal]]** (More abundant on the trunk, less on limbs).
    *   *Note:* **Axilla** is affected; **Palms and Soles** are usually spared.
*   **[[Pleomorphism]]:** A characteristic feature where **all stages of the rash** (papules, vesicles, crusts) are seen simultaneously in the same area.

**Mnemonic for Rash:** **VP** = **V**aricella is **P**leomorphic and **C**entripetal.

### **5. Comparison: Chickenpox vs. Smallpox**

| Feature | Chickenpox | Smallpox (Eradicated) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Distribution** | **Centripetal** (Trunk > Limbs) | **Centrifugal** (Face/Limbs > Trunk) |
| **Evolution** | Rapid, Pleomorphic (all stages together) | Slow, Non-pleomorphic (same stage) |
| **Depth** | Superficial (Dew-drop) | Deep-seated (Shotty) |
| **Location** | Axilla affected; Palms/Soles spared | Axilla spared; Palms/Soles affected |
| **Fever** | Rises with each crop of rash | Falls when rash appears |

### **6. Complications**

*   **Most Common:** Secondary bacterial infections (e.g., by Staph or Strep).
*   **Serious:**
    *   **Varicella Pneumonia** (common in adults/neonates).
    *   **Encephalitis** and Cerebellar Ataxia.
    *   **Reye’s Syndrome** (associated with **Aspirin** use).
    *   Hemorrhagic varicella (in immunocompromised).

**Clinical Relevance:**
**NEVER** give **Aspirin** (salicylates) to a child with Chickenpox due to the risk of **Reye's Syndrome** (hepatic encephalopathy),. Use Paracetamol for fever.

---

### **7. Diagnosis**

*   Usually clinical (Rash characteristics).
*   **Lab:** PCR (VZV DNA), Tzanck smear (multinucleated giant cells).

---

### **8. Treatment**

*   **Supportive:** Calamine lotion for itching, Paracetamol for fever, hygiene to prevent secondary infection.
*   **Antivirals:** **Acyclovir** (effective if started within 24 hours of rash). Recommended for adults, adolescents, and immunocompromised patients.

---

### **9. Prevention and Control**

**A. Immunization**
*   **Vaccine:** Live attenuated vaccine.
*   **Strain:** **[[OKA Strain]]**.
*   **Schedule:** Recommended for children 12–18 months. Can be given up to 12 years (single dose) or >13 years (2 doses, 4-8 weeks apart).
*   **Efficacy:** >90% seroconversion.

**B. Passive Immunization**
*   **Varicella-Zoster Immunoglobulin (VZIG):**
    *   Given within **72 hours** of exposure.
    *   **Indications:** Immunocompromised contacts, susceptible pregnant women, and newborns of mothers who develop chickenpox 5 days before to 2 days after delivery.

**C. Control Measures**
*   **Notification:** Reporting to health authorities.
*   **Isolation:** Isolate the case for **6 days** after the onset of rash (until all vesicles have crusted).
*   **Disinfection:** Articles soiled by nose/throat discharges.
