# [[Principles Of Epidemiology And Epidemiologic Methods]] > Descriptive Epidemiology

**Descriptive Epidemiology** is the first phase of epidemiological investigation. It is the study of the distribution of disease or health-related events in human populations. It is essentially an observational study where we allow nature to take its course and the investigator merely measures the events without intervention.

The primary objective is to describe the disease in terms of **Time, Place, and Person**. It answers the three basic questions:
1.  **When** is the disease occurring? (Time)
2.  **Where** is it occurring? (Place)
3.  **Who** is getting the disease? (Person)

### **Steps in Descriptive Epidemiology**

There is a systematic procedure consisting of **6 Steps** to conduct a descriptive study:

**1. Defining the Population**
*   Epidemiology studies populations, not individuals.
*   The first step is to define the [[population base]] or the **"Population at risk"**.
*   This provides the **denominator** for calculating rates (incidence/prevalence) which are essential for measuring disease frequency.

**2. Defining the Disease**
*   The clinician needs a definition for treatment (which can change), but the epidemiologist needs a precise and valid definition to accurately measure disease in a large population.
*   This is called an **[[Operational Definition]]**.
*   *Example:* Tonsillitis is clinically "inflammation of tonsils". Operational definition: "Enlarged red tonsils with white exudate, positive for *S. pyogenes* on culture".,

**3. Describing the Disease (Time, Place, and Person)**
This is the core of descriptive epidemiology.

#### **A. Time Distribution**
Disease patterns change over time. These fluctuations are classified into three types:

1.  **Short-term Fluctuations (Epidemics):**
    *   Occurrence of cases clearly in excess of [[Normal Expectancy]].
    *   **Types of Epidemics:**
        *   **Common Source:**
            *   *Single Exposure (Point Source):* Sharp rise and fall, clustering of cases within one incubation period. *Example:* [[Bhopal Gas Tragedy]], Food poisoning. > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Point source epidemic curve showing sharp peak
            *   *Continuous/Multiple Exposure:* Sharp rise but fall is interrupted by secondary waves. *Example:* Contaminated well water.,
        *   **Propagated Epidemic:** Person-to-person transmission. Gradual rise and long tail off. *Example:* Hepatitis A, Polio.

2.  **Periodic Fluctuations:**
    *   **Seasonal Trend:** Related to environmental conditions (temp, humidity, vectors). *Example:* Measles in early spring, GI infections in summer, Malaria in rainy season.
    *   **Cyclic Trend:** Disease occurs in cycles over days, months, or years due to variation in [[Herd Immunity]]. *Example:* Measles every 2-3 years (pre-vaccination), Influenza pandemics every 7-10 years.

3.  **Long-term or [[Secular Trends]]:**
    *   Consistent change (increase or decrease) over decades.
    *   *Example:* Decline in TB/Polio, Rise in Coronary Heart Disease, Lung Cancer, Diabetes.

#### **B. Place Distribution**
Comparing disease frequency in different geographical areas to gain clues about aetiology.
*   **International Variations:** Cancer of stomach is common in Japan; Oral cancer in India.
*   **National Variations:** Goitre belt in Himalayan region; Malaria in specific zones.
*   **Rural-Urban Variations:** Urban areas have higher rates of lung cancer, accidents, mental illness. Rural areas have higher skin/zoonotic diseases.
*   **Local Distributions:** Studied using **[[Spot Maps]]**.
    *   Shows clustering of cases.
    *   *Classic Example:* **John Snow's** spot map of cholera cases in London (Broad Street Pump) proved cholera was water-borne before bacteria were discovered. > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> John Snow's Spot Map of London,
*   **Migration Studies:** Comparing migrants to locals helps distinguish between **Genetic** and **Environmental** factors.

#### **C. Person Distribution**
Defining the host characteristics associated with the disease.
*   **Age:** Strongest association with disease. (e.g., Measles in childhood, Atherosclerosis in old age). Bimodal distribution seen in Hodgkin's lymphoma.,
*   **Sex:** Men (Lung cancer, CHD); Women (Thyroid disorders, SLE).
*   **Social Class:** Poor (Infectious diseases); Affluent (Coronary Heart Disease).
*   **Others:** Occupation, Marital status, Behaviour (Smoking, Diet).

**4. Measurement of Disease**
*   We need to quantify the "Disease Load".
*   **Cross-Sectional Studies (Prevalence Study):** Simplest form. Examines a cross-section of the population at a **single point in time**. Provides **Prevalence** not incidence.
*   **Longitudinal Studies:** Repeated observations of the same population over time. Provides **Incidence**.

**5. Comparing with Known Indices**
*   The essence of epidemiology is comparison.
*   Compare the collected data with other populations or subgroups to identify **High Risk Groups**.

**6. Formulation of a Hypothesis**
*   This is the final outcome of a descriptive study.
*   A hypothesis is a supposition derived from observation that can be tested.
*   It must specify:
    *   **Population** (Who)
    *   **Specific Cause** (Agent)
    *   **Expected Outcome** (Disease)
    *   **Dose-response relationship**
    *   **Time-response relationship**
*   *Example:* "Smoking 30-40 cigarettes/day causes lung cancer in 10% of smokers after 20 years.",

### **Uses of Descriptive Epidemiology**
1.  **Magnitude of Load:** Provides data on morbidity and mortality for the community.
2.  **Clues to Aetiology:** Helps formulate an aetiological hypothesis (e.g., Smoking -> Lung Cancer).
3.  **Planning & Evaluation:** Provides background data for planning preventive/curative services and evaluating them.
