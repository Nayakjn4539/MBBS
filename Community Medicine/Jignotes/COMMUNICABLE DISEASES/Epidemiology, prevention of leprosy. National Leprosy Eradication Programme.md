# Epidemiology and Prevention of Leprosy

Leprosy, also known as [[Hansen's Disease]], is a chronic infectious disease caused by *Mycobacterium leprae*. It primarily affects the peripheral nerves and skin, but can also involve muscles, eyes, bones, and internal organs. It is often termed a "Social Disease" due to the stigma associated with the deformities it causes.

### **Epidemiological Determinants**

#### **1. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** [[Mycobacterium leprae]]. It is an acid-fast bacillus, obligate intracellular parasite (affinity for Schwann cells and Macrophages).
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Generation Time:** Extremely long (12–13 days), explaining the long incubation period.
    *   **Viability:** Can survive in dried nasal secretions for 9 days and moist soil for 46 days.
    *   **Infectivity vs. Pathogenicity:** High infectivity but **low pathogenicity** (most people infected do not develop the disease).
*   **Reservoir:** Human beings are the only known reservoir.
*   **Source of Infection:** Multibacillary (MB) cases are the most important source.
    *   **Portal of Exit:** The **nose** is the major portal of exit. Millions of bacilli are discharged in nasal secretions of lepromatous patients. Broken skin is a minor route.

#### **2. Host Factors**
*   **Age:** Can affect all ages. In endemic areas, peak incidence is 10–14 years and 30–50 years.
*   **Sex:** Males are affected more frequently than females (Ratio ~ 2:1).
*   **Immunity:** [[Cell-Mediated Immunity]] (CMI) determines the type of leprosy:
    *   **Strong CMI:** Results in Tuberculoid Leprosy (localized).
    *   **Absent/Low CMI:** Results in Lepromatous Leprosy (generalized).
    *   *Note:* The **Lepromin Test** is used to assess CMI status, **not** for diagnosis.

#### **3. Environmental Factors**
*   **Transmission:**
    *   **Droplet Infection (Aerosols):** Main route via sneezing/coughing of untreated MB patients.
    *   **Contact:** Prolonged, close skin-to-skin contact.
    *   **Indirect:** Through fomites or soil (rare).
*   **Socio-economic:** Associated with overcrowding, poverty, and lack of ventilation.

#### **4. Incubation Period**
*   **Duration:** Very long, usually **3 to 5 years** (range: 6 months to 20 years).

### **Clinical Classification & Diagnosis**

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a spectrum line showing TT (Tuberculoid) -> BT -> BB -> BL -> LL (Lepromatous) to represent Ridley-Jopling classification based on immunity

**Cardinal Signs (Diagnostic Criteria):**
At least **ONE** of the following must be present to diagnose leprosy:
1.  **Hypopigmented or reddish skin patch** with definite **loss of sensation**.
2.  **Thickened peripheral nerve** with loss of sensation/weakness of muscles supplied.
3.  **Positive Skin Smear** for Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB).

**Operational Classification (for Treatment Purposes):**

| Type | **Paucibacillary (PB)** | **Multibacillary (MB)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Skin Lesions** | 1 to 5 lesions | $\ge$ 6 lesions |
| **Nerve Involvement**| No or 1 nerve involved | > 1 nerve involved |
| **Skin Smear** | Negative | Positive (at any site) |

### **Prevention of Leprosy**

#### **1. Primary Prevention**
*   **Chemoprophylaxis:** **Single Dose Rifampicin (SDR)** is given to eligible contacts (household, neighbors, social contacts) of leprosy patients to break the chain of transmission.
    *   *Dose:* Adults: 600 mg; Children (10-14y): 450 mg.
*   **Immunoprophylaxis:** BCG vaccine provides variable protection (20-80%). The **MIP (Mycobacterium Indicus Pranii)** vaccine is also used in India.
*   **Education:** Reducing overcrowding and improving hygiene.

#### **2. Secondary Prevention (Core Strategy)**
*   **Early Diagnosis:** Active case detection campaigns (e.g., LCDC).
*   **Multi-Drug Therapy (MDT):** Renders infectious cases non-infectious rapidly (within weeks). It prevents drug resistance and relapse.

#### **3. Tertiary Prevention**
*   **Disability Limitation:** Treatment of Lepra reactions, care of anesthetic hands/feet, use of MCR (Micro-Cellular Rubber) footwear.
*   **Rehabilitation:** Reconstructive surgery (RCS) for deformities (claw hand, foot drop), vocational training, and reducing social stigma.

### **National Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP)**

Launched in **1983** (renamed from National Leprosy Control Programme of 1955).
**Status:** India achieved "Elimination" (Prevalence Rate <1 per 10,000 population) at the national level in **December 2005**.

**Current Vision:** [[Leprosy Mukt Bharat]] (Leprosy-free India).

#### **1. Goals and Targets**
*   **Elimination:** Maintain Prevalence Rate (PR) <1/10,000 in all districts.
*   **Disability:** Reduce Grade II disability among new cases to <1 per million population.
*   **Stigma:** Zero discrimination.

#### **2. Strategies**
*   **Decentralized Integrated Services:** Diagnosis and treatment available at all Primary Health Centers (PHCs).
*   **Active Case Detection:**
    *   **LCDC (Leprosy Case Detection Campaign):** House-to-house search in high endemic districts.
    *   **ABSULS (ASHA-Based Surveillance for Leprosy Suspects):** ASHA workers actively look for suspects.
*   **Treatment (MDT):** Provided free of cost in blister packs.

**MDT Regimens (Adults)**:

| Drug | **Paucibacillary (PB)** (Duration: 6 months) | **Multibacillary (MB)** (Duration: 12 months) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rifampicin** | 600 mg (Monthly supervised) | 600 mg (Monthly supervised) |
| **Clofazimine** | **Nil** | 300 mg (Monthly) + 50 mg (Daily) |
| **Dapsone** | 100 mg (Daily) | 100 mg (Daily) |

> **Mnemonic for MDT:** **R**ed **D**evil **C**ures
> *   **R**ifampicin (Red urine side effect)
> *   **D**apsone
> *   **C**lofazimine (Causes skin pigmentation/blackening)

#### **3. New Initiatives**
*   **Nikusth 2.0:** Web-based reporting system for leprosy cases.
*   **SPARSH Leprosy Awareness Campaign:** Nationwide awareness drives to reduce stigma (launched on Jan 30, Anti-Leprosy Day).
*   **Incentives:** For ASHA workers for detecting new cases and ensuring treatment completion.
*   **DPMR (Disability Prevention & Medical Rehabilitation):** Welfare allowance (₹8000) for patients undergoing reconstructive surgery.

#### **4. Indicators for Monitoring**
*   **Epidemiological:** Annual New Case Detection Rate (ANCDR), Prevalence Rate, % of Grade II disability.
*   **Operational:** Cure rate, Treatment completion rate.
