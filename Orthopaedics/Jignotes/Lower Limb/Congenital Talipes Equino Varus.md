# [[Lower Limb]] > Congenital Talipes Equino Varus

# Congenital Talipes Equino Varus (CTEV)

### Definition and Nomenclature
**Congenital Talipes Equino Varus**, commonly known as **Clubfoot**, is one of the most common and complex congenital deformities of the foot. The term is derived from:
*   **Talipes:** *Talus* (ankle) + *Pes* (foot).
*   **Equinus:** The foot is plantarflexed (like a horse's hoof).
*   **Varus:** The heel is turned inward.

It is a congenital deformity characterized by a specific pattern of misalignment involving the hindfoot, midfoot, and forefoot. It is often bilateral (50% of cases) and more common in boys.

### Etiology
The exact cause is often unknown (idiopathic), but several theories exist:
*   **Mechanical Theory:** Increased intrauterine pressure or malposition forces the foot into a deformed position.
*   **Genetic Theory:** Polygenic inheritance pattern.
*   **Neuromuscular Defect:** Subclinical forms of [[Spina bifida]] or muscular dystrophy.
*   **Arrest of Development:** Developmental arrest during the fetal stage (around 8-9 weeks) when the foot is normally in equinovarus position.
*   **Germ Plasm Defect:** Defect in the [[Talus]] and mere persistence of the fetal position.

### Pathoanatomy
The deformity involves bony malformations and soft tissue contractures, primarily on the **medial** and **posterior** aspects of the foot.

#### Bony Changes
*   **[[Talus]]:** This is the primary deformed bone. The neck is deviated medially and plantarflexed.
*   **[[Calcaneum]]:** Rotated medially (varus) and plantarflexed (equinus).
*   **[[Navicular]]:** Displaced medially and articulates with the medial malleolus (in severe cases).
*   **[[Cuboid]]:** Displaced medially.

#### Soft Tissue Contractures
The soft tissues on the concave side (medial and posterior) are shortened and underdeveloped.
*   **Posterior Contractures:** [[Tendo-Achilles]], posterior capsule of the ankle, talocalcaneal ligament.
*   **Medial Contractures:** [[Tibialis Posterior]], flexor digitorum longus, flexor hallucis longus, deltoid ligament, talonavicular capsule (Spring ligament).
*   **Plantar Contractures:** [[Plantar fascia]], intrinsic muscles.

### Clinical Features and Deformities
The foot presents with a characteristic "club" shape. The deformities can be remembered by the mnemonic **CAVE**.

| Deformity | Anatomical Location | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **C**avus | Midfoot | High medial arch due to pronation of the forefoot in relation to the hindfoot. |
| **A**dduction | Forefoot | Forefoot deviates medially at the tarsometatarsal joints. |
| **V**arus | Hindfoot (Heel) | Inversion of the [[Calcaneum]]. |
| **E**quinus | Ankle | Fixed plantarflexion at the ankle joint. |

**Signs on Inspection:**
*   **Heel:** Small, empty, and raised (can be felt on palpation).
*   **Creases:** Deep skin creases on the medial border and posterior aspect of the heel.
*   **Borders:** The outer border of the foot is convex, and the inner border is concave.
*   **Bony Prominence:** The head of the [[Talus]] can be felt on the dorsolateral aspect of the foot (uncovered due to medial displacement of the navicular).
*   **Calf Atrophy:** The calf muscles are often wasted and the leg is thin.

### Clinical Implications
1.  **Associated Anomalies:** Always examine the hips to rule out [[Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip]] (DDH) and the spine for [[Spina Bifida]] or dimples indicating spinal dysraphism.
2.  **Syndromic Association:** If the clubfoot is rigid and associated with other contractures, suspect [[Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita]] (AMC).
3.  **Walking Child:** In neglected cases, the child walks on the dorsolateral aspect of the foot, leading to callosity formation and "false malleolus" (bursa over cuboid).

### Classification
1.  **Idiopathic CTEV:** Most common; isolated deformity in an otherwise normal child.
2.  **Secondary CTEV:** Associated with neurological disorders ([[Meningomyelocele]], [[Polio]]), syndromes ([[Arthrogryposis]]), or bony anomalies (Tibial hemimelia).
3.  **Positional/Postural:** Flexible deformity due to intrauterine packing; fully correctable passively.

**Scoring System: [[Pirani Score]]**
Used to assess severity and monitor treatment.
*   **Total Score:** 0 to 6 (Higher score = more severe).
*   **Hindfoot Score (0-3):** Posterior crease, Empty heel, Rigid equinus.
*   **Midfoot Score (0-3):** Curvature of lateral border, Medial crease, Palpation of lateral part of talar head.

### Diagnosis and Imaging
Diagnosis is primarily clinical. X-rays are used for assessment and prognosis (Kite’s Index).

**Radiology (X-Ray):**
*   **Views:** AP and Lateral (stress dorsiflexion).
*   **Kite’s Angle (Talocalcaneal Angle):**
    *   Angle between the long axis of the [[Talus]] and [[Calcaneum]].
    *   **Normal:** 20°–40°.
    *   **CTEV:** < 20° (The bones appear parallel to each other).
    *   **Lateral View:** The angle is also reduced (< 35° is abnormal).

### Treatment
The goal is to achieve a plantigrade, pliable, painless, and functional foot.

#### 1. Non-Operative Treatment (Gold Standard)
**The Ponseti Method:**
This is the standard of care worldwide. It relies on the specific biomechanics of the subtalar joint.
*   **Timing:** Should start as early as possible (preferably within the first week of life).
*   **Technique:** Serial manipulation and casting (Pop casts changed weekly).
*   **Sequence of Correction:** (Crucial for exams)
    1.  **Correction of Cavus:** By supination of the forefoot (aligning forefoot with hindfoot).
    2.  **Correction of Adduction and Varus:** By abducting the foot while applying counter-pressure on the head of the [[Talus]]. **Never** touch the calcaneum.
    3.  **Correction of Equinus:** Corrected *last*. Often requires a minor surgical procedure.

**Percutaneous Tendo-Achilles Tenotomy:**
*   Performed if equinus persists after varus/adduction correction (required in >90% of cases).
*   A small cut is made in the Achilles tendon to allow the heel to drop down.
*   Followed by a final cast for 3 weeks.

**Maintenance (Bracing):**
*   **Foot Abduction Orthosis (FAO) / [[Denis Browne Splint]]:**
    *   Used after the final cast is removed to prevent recurrence.
    *   Worn 23 hours/day for 3 months, then at night/naps until 3–4 years of age.
    *   Shoes are set at **70° external rotation** (affected side) and **40°** (normal side).

#### 2. Operative Treatment
Indicated for resistant cases, neglected cases, or recurrences (relapses) despite casting.

**Soft Tissue Procedures:**
*   **Posteromedial Release (PMR) / Turco’s Operation:**
    *   Release of all tight structures on the posterior and medial aspects (capsulotomies of ankle/subtalar/talonavicular joints, lengthening of tendons).
    *   Performed usually between 6–12 months of age if Ponseti fails.

**Bony Procedures (Salvage for Late/Neglected Cases):**
*   **[[Dwyer's Osteotomy]]:** Calcaneal osteotomy for persistent varus.
*   **[[Dilwyn Evans Procedure]]:** Calcaneo-cuboid fusion.
*   **[[Triple Arthrodesis]]:** Fusion of subtalar, talonavicular, and calcaneocuboid joints. Indicated only after skeletal maturity (>10-12 years).
*   **[[Ilizarov]] Fixator / JESS:** For complex, neglected, or rigid deformities in older children.

### Complications
1.  **Recurrence:** Most common, usually due to non-compliance with bracing.
2.  **Rocker Bottom Foot (Persian Slipper Foot):**
    *   Caused by iatrogenic error: Attempting to correct **Equinus** before correcting the **Varus** and **Adduction**.
    *   This "breaks" the midfoot, causing a convex sole while the heel remains fixed in equinus.
3.  **Flat Top Talus:** Due to forceful manipulation.
4.  **Skin Ulceration/Necrosis:** Due to tight casting.
