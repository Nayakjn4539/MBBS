# Otitis Externa

### Definition and Overview
[[Otitis externa]] (OE) is the inflammation of the skin lining the [[external auditory canal]] (EAC). It may also involve the [[pinna]] and the outer surface of the [[tympanic membrane]]. It can be acute (< 6 weeks) or chronic (> 3 months). It is commonly known as **Swimmer’s ear**, **Tropical ear**, or **Telephonist’s ear**.

### Classification
Otitis externa can be classified based on extent and etiology:

1.  **Localized Otitis Externa:** [[Furuncle]] (Boil).
2.  **Diffuse Otitis Externa:** Generalized inflammation of the meatal skin (Swimmer's ear).
3.  **Malignant Otitis Externa:** Necrotizing infection involving the skull base.
4.  **Fungal Otitis Externa:** [[Otomycosis]].
5.  **Viral Otitis Externa:** [[Herpes Zoster Oticus]], [[Bullous Myringitis]].
6.  **Reactive/Eczematous:** Seborrheic dermatitis, neurodermatitis, contact dermatitis.

### Etiology and Predisposing Factors
*   **Trauma:** Scratching with hairpins, matchsticks, or vigorous cleaning disrupts the protective barrier.
*   **Moisture:** Excessive sweating, swimming, or humid climates change the pH of the canal from acid to alkaline, favoring bacterial growth.
*   **Obstruction:** [[Stenosis]], [[exostoses]], or impacted [[cerumen]] prevent debris migration.
*   **Allergy:** Reaction to topical ear drops (e.g., neomycin) or hearing aid molds.
*   **Systemic Conditions:** [[Diabetes mellitus]], immunosuppression.

### 1. Localized Otitis Externa (Furunculosis)
Infection of the hair follicle, restricted to the **cartilaginous part** (outer 1/3) of the EAC, as hair is absent in the bony part.

*   **Causative Organism:** *[[Staphylococcus aureus]]*.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Pain:** Severe and excruciating, disproportionate to the size of the boil.
    *   **Jaw Movement Pain:** Pain aggravates on chewing or yawning.
    *   **Tragal Tenderness (Tragal Sign):** Positive. Pain on pressing the [[tragus]] or pulling the pinna.
    *   **Swelling:** Obliteration of the retroauricular groove if the furuncle is on the posterior wall.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Systemic antibiotics (anti-staphylococcal).
    *   **10% [[Ichthammol Glycerine]] pack:** Glycerine is hygroscopic (reduces edema), and Ichthammol is antiseptic.
    *   Incision and drainage if an abscess forms.

### 2. Diffuse Otitis Externa (Swimmer's Ear)
Diffuse inflammation of the meatal skin extending to the bony canal and tympanic membrane.

*   **Causative Organism:** Most commonly *[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]*, followed by *Staphylococcus aureus*.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Acute Phase:** Burning sensation, pain (aggravated by jaw movement), and serous to purulent discharge.
    *   **Chronic Phase:** Intense itching (pruritus) and scaling.
    *   **Examination:** Erythema, edema of the canal, and conductive hearing loss due to debris.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Aural Toilet:** Meticulous removal of debris/discharge is the most important step.
    *   **Medication:** Topical antibiotic steroid drops (e.g., [[Ciprofloxacin]], [[Ofloxacin]]). Systemic antibiotics are used for complications like cellulitis.
    *   **Ear Wick:** Used if the canal is very edematous to facilitate drug delivery.

### 3. Otomycosis (Fungal Ear Infection)
Fungal infection of the EAC, common in hot/humid climates or after prolonged antibiotic use.

*   **Causative Organisms:**
    *   *[[Aspergillus niger]]* (Most common): Black-headed filamentous growth.
    *   *[[Candida albicans]]*: Creamy white/cotton wool appearance.
*   **Clinical Features:** Intense itching (pruritus), pain, and blocked sensation.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Wet Newspaper Appearance:** Seen in *Aspergillus* infections (black specks on white debris).
    *   **Cotton Wool Appearance:** Seen in *Candida* infections.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Thorough suction cleaning (aural toilet).
    *   Antifungal drops (Clotrimazole) or 2% Salicylic acid in alcohol.

### 4. Malignant Otitis Externa (Necrotizing Otitis Externa)
An aggressive, potentially life-threatening inflammatory infection of the EAC spreading to the temporal bone and skull base.

*   **Target Population:** Elderly diabetics and immunocompromised patients.
*   **Causative Organism:** *[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]*.
*   **Pathology:** Spreads through the **[[Fissures of Santorini]]** to the parotid, mastoid, and skull base, causing osteomyelitis.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Pain:** Excruciating, deep-seated, often nocturnal otalgia.
    *   **Otorrhea:** Purulent, foul-smelling discharge.
    *   **Granulation Tissue:** Characteristic finding at the bony-cartilaginous junction of the ear canal.
    *   **Cranial Nerve Palsy:** [[Facial nerve]] (VII) is most commonly involved at the stylomastoid foramen. Can involve IX, X, XI, and XII.
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   **CT Scan:** Shows bone erosion (cortical destruction).
    *   **Technetium-99 Scan:** Useful for early diagnosis (shows osteoblastic activity) but not for follow-up.
    *   **Gallium-67 Scan:** Useful for monitoring resolution of infection (taken up by inflammatory cells).
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Antibiotics:** Prolonged course (6–8 weeks) of IV antipseudomonals (e.g., [[Ciprofloxacin]], Ceftazidime).
    *   **Control of Diabetes:** Strict glycemic control is essential.
    *   **Debridement:** Removal of necrotic tissue.

### 5. Viral Otitis Externa

#### A. Herpes Zoster Oticus
*   **Etiology:** [[Varicella Zoster Virus]].
*   **Features:** Severe otalgia with vesicular eruption on the concha, EAC, and postauricular groove.
*   **Ramsay Hunt Syndrome:** Herpes Zoster Oticus associated with **Facial Nerve Palsy**.

#### B. Bullous Myringitis (Otitis Externa Haemorrhagica)
*   **Etiology:** Viral (Influenza) or *[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]*.
*   **Features:** Severe pain and hemorrhagic bullae (blood-filled blisters) on the tympanic membrane and deep meatus.
*   **Treatment:** Analgesics and antibiotics (to prevent secondary infection).

### Comparison Table: Furunculosis vs. Acute Mastoiditis
(Differential Diagnosis)

| Feature | Furunculosis | Acute Mastoiditis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **History** | No history of middle ear infection | Preceding Acute Otitis Media (AOM) |
| **Pain** | Aggravated by jaw movement/pinna movement | Persistent deep pain, not aggravated by jaw movement |
| **Discharge** | Purulent, no mucus | Mucopurulent (contains mucus from middle ear) |
| **Tenderness** | **Tragal tenderness present** | **Mastoid tenderness present** |
| **Swelling** | Cartilaginous part of meatus | Bony mastoid region/postauricular |
| **Tympanic Membrane** | Normal | Perforated or congested |
| **Hearing Loss** | Mild (occlusion) | Conductive (moderate) |
| **Nodes** | Pre/Postauricular nodes enlarged | Usually not enlarged |

### Clinical Implications & Viva Questions

*   **Tragal Sign:** Pain on pressing the tragus indicates external ear pathology (Furunculosis/OE) rather than middle ear disease.
*   **Why is discharge in OE never mucoid?** The external auditory canal is lined by skin (stratified squamous epithelium) and lacks mucus-secreting glands. Mucus in discharge implies a middle ear origin (TM perforation).
*   **Fissures of Santorini:** Defects in the cartilaginous canal floor allow infection (like MOE) to spread to the parotid gland and skull base.
*   **Syringing Contraindications:** Do not syringe if there is a history of TM perforation, vegetative foreign body (it swells), or acute infection.
