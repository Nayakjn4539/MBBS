# [[HEALTH CARE OF THE COMMUNITY]] > Voluntary Health Agency

### Definition
A [[Voluntary Health Agency]] is defined as an organization that is administered by an autonomous board which holds meetings, collects funds for its support chiefly from private sources, and expends money, whether with or without paid workers, in conducting a program directed primarily to furthering public health by providing health services, health education, research, or legislation.

### Key Characteristics
*   **Autonomy:** Administered by an autonomous board.
*   **Funding:** Primarily from private sources/donations.
*   **Goal:** Furthering public health (Service, Education, Research).
*   **Nature:** Non-profit and Non-political.

### Functions of Voluntary Health Agencies
The functions can be remembered using the Mnemonic **SPEED LG**.

*   **S** - **Supplementing** the work of government agencies (filling gaps where government resources are limited).
*   **P** - **Pioneering** new procedures/methods (exploring new ways of doing things, e.g., Family Planning was first started by voluntary agencies).
*   **E** - **Education** of the public (Health education).
*   **E** - **Demonstration** of projects (e.g., Borehole latrines demonstrated by Rockefeller Foundation).

*   **L** - **Legislation** advancement (Mobilizing public opinion for health laws).
*   **G** - **Guarding** the work of government agencies (acting as a critic and guide).

> **Analogy:** Voluntary health agencies are compared to **"Motor Trucks"** which can penetrate the by-ways, while Official (Govt) agencies are like **"Railway Trunk Lines"** which run on tracks established by law.
