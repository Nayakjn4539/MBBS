# Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis (AKC)

**Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis (AKC)** is a chronic, bilateral, non-infectious inflammation of the conjunctiva and eyelids. It can be thought of as the adult equivalent of [[Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis]] (VKC), but is often more severe, unremitting, and associated with significant corneal complications and visual morbidity.

It is frequently associated with a history of atopy, specifically [[Atopic Dermatitis]] (eczema).

### Epidemiology and Etiopathogenesis

*   **Age:** Typically affects young adults (late teens to 5th decade). The onset is usually later than VKC.
*   **Sex:** Slight male predominance (though less marked than in VKC).
*   **Genetics:** Often a family history of [[Atopy]] (asthma, hay fever, urticaria).
*   **Pathogenesis:** A complex immune mechanism involving both **Type I** (IgE-mediated) and **Type IV** (cell-mediated) hypersensitivity reactions.
    *   Mast cells and eosinophils are found in the conjunctival epithelium.
    *   There is a depressed cell-mediated immunity, predisposing patients to secondary infections (Staphylococcal, Herpes Simplex).

### Clinical Features

The course is protracted with exacerbations and remissions. Symptoms are often perennial (year-round) rather than strictly seasonal, though they may worsen in winter or summer.

#### Symptoms
*   **Itching:** The hallmark symptom (often moderate to severe).
*   **Watering and Mucoid Discharge:** Often stringy or ropy.
*   **Photophobia:** Indicates corneal involvement.
*   **Burning sensation and dryness.**
*   **Blurring of vision.**

#### Signs

**1. Eyelid Signs** (Characteristic of AKC)
The skin of the eyelids is often dry, thickened, and crusted (eczematous).
*   **Tylosis:** Thickening of the lid margins.
*   **Dennie-Morgan Folds:** Extra infraorbital folds/creases due to chronic eyelid rubbing and edema.
*   **Hertoghe’s Sign:** Loss of the lateral portion of the eyebrows (due to chronic rubbing).
*   **Madarosis:** Loss of eyelashes.
*   **Blepharitis:** Chronic Staphylococcal blepharitis is common.
*   **Mechanical issues:** [[Ectropion]], [[Entropion]], or [[Trichiasis]] due to scarring.

**2. Conjunctival Signs**
*   **Hyperemia and Chemosis:** Generalized redness.
*   **Papillary Reaction:**
    *   Fine micropapillae are common.
    *   **Location:** Predominantly affects the **lower tarsal conjunctiva** (unlike VKC which affects the upper tarsus).
    *   In severe cases, giant papillae (>1mm) can occur but are less common than in VKC.
*   **Cicatrization:** Progressive scarring can lead to shrinkage of the fornices (symblepharon).
*   **Tarsal Conjunctiva:** Often has a "milky" appearance due to edema and infiltration.
*   **Limbal involvement:** Gelatinous hyperplasia and [[Trantas Dots]] (degenerating eosinophils) may be present during active phases.

**3. Corneal Signs (Keratopathy)**
Corneal involvement is frequent and vision-threatening.
*   **Punctate Epithelial Erosions (PEE):** Often in the lower one-third of the cornea.
*   **Persistent Epithelial Defects:** Can lead to thinning and melting.
*   **Corneal Vascularization:** Peripheral neovascularization is more common in AKC than VKC.
*   **Filamentary Keratitis.**
*   **Corneal Plaques:** Vernal-like plaques may form.
*   **Secondary Infections:** Prone to [[Staphylococcal Blepharitis]] and [[Herpes Simplex Keratitis]].

### Ocular and Systemic Associations

| Association | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Keratoconus]]** | Associated in ~15% of cases (likely due to chronic eye rubbing). |
| **[[Cataract]]** | Anterior or posterior subcapsular cataracts (Atopic Cataract). Can be due to the disease or long-term steroid use. |
| **[[Retinal Detachment]]** | Higher incidence than the general population. |
| **Systemic Atopy** | Asthma, Hay fever, Urticaria. |

### Differential Diagnosis: AKC vs. VKC

| Feature | Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) | Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Age** | Children/Adolescents (puberty) | Young Adults (20s–50s) |
| **Course** | Self-limiting (resolves by 20s) | Chronic, often persists for decades |
| **Seasonality** | Spring/Summer (Warm weather) | Perennial (Year-round) |
| **Conjunctiva** | **Upper Tarsus** (Giant Papillae/Cobblestone) | **Lower Tarsus** (Papillae, Scarring) |
| **Corneal Scars** | Common | Common and vision-threatening |
| **Eyelid Skin** | Usually normal | **Eczematous**, thickened, fissures |
| **Vascularization** | Rare | Common |

### Management

AKC is generally harder to treat than VKC. The goal is to control symptoms and prevent corneal damage.

**1. General Measures**
*   **Avoidance:** Identify and avoid known allergens (dust mites, animal dander).
*   **Lid Hygiene:** Treat associated [[Blepharitis]] with warm compresses and lid scrubs.
*   **Lubrication:** Preservative-free artificial tears to improve barrier function and wash away allergens.
*   **Cold Compresses:** For symptomatic relief.

**2. Medical Therapy**
*   **Topical Mast Cell Stabilizers:** e.g., [[Sodium Cromoglycate]] (2%), [[Lodoxamide]]. Useful for maintenance but may not control acute exacerbations.
*   **Dual-action agents (Antihistamine + Mast Cell Stabilizer):** e.g., [[Olopatadine]], [[Ketotifen]], [[Bepotastine]]. First-line for itching.
*   **Topical Corticosteroids:** e.g., [[Fluorometholone]], [[Loteprednol]]. Used for acute exacerbations.
    *   *Clinical Implication:* Use with caution due to risk of [[Glaucoma]] and [[Cataract]], especially since AKC is a chronic condition requiring long-term management.
*   **Topical Immunomodulators (Calcineurin Inhibitors):**
    *   **[[Cyclosporine]] (0.05% - 1%):** Very effective as a steroid-sparing agent for long-term control.
    *   **[[Tacrolimus]] (0.03% ointment):** Highly effective, especially for lid eczema and refractory cases.
*   **Systemic Therapy:**
    *   Oral Antihistamines (e.g., Cetirizine, Loratadine) for itching.
    *   Oral Antibiotics (e.g., [[Doxycycline]], [[Azithromycin]]) for associated Meibomian gland dysfunction.
    *   Systemic immunosuppressants (rarely needed) for severe, blinding disease.

**3. Surgical Management**
*   **[[Penetrating Keratoplasty]] (PK):** For visual rehabilitation in cases of severe corneal scarring or keratoconus.
    *   *Note:* Prognosis is guarded due to high risk of graft rejection, vascularization, and surface inflammation.
*   **Cataract Surgery:** For atopic or steroid-induced cataracts.
*   **Correction of Lid Abnormalities:** Tarsorrhaphy or trichiasis correction if needed.
