# [[Asphyxia]] > emphysema Aquosum vs edema Acquosum

### Emphysema Aquosum vs. Edema Aquosum

In the context of [[Drowning]], the condition of the lungs during a [[Medicolegal Autopsy]] varies significantly depending on whether the victim was conscious and struggling or unconscious at the time of submersion.

---

### 1. Emphysema Aquosum (The "Drowning Lung")

This is the classical presentation seen in typical **wet drowning** cases where the victim was conscious and struggling for life.

**Mechanism:**
*   It occurs due to the violent efforts of the victim to breathe while submerged.
*   Inhalation of water irritates the airway, stimulating mucus secretion.
*   The violent respiratory struggle causes a churning mixture of **Air + Water + Mucus + [[Surfactant]]**.
*   This whipping action creates a fine, tough, lathery froth that gets trapped in the alveoli and bronchioles.
*   The check-valve mechanism (air/water enters but cannot exit) leads to over-distension of alveoli.

**Autopsy Findings:**
*   **Volume:** Lungs are voluminous, heavy, and edematous.
*   **Ballooning:** They bulge out of the chest cavity upon removing the sternum (Ballooning of lungs).
*   **Weight:** Increased significantly (up to 2 kg).
*   **Consistency:** They feel doughy and pit on pressure.
*   **Appearance:**
    *   Pale or distended (hyper-inflated).
    *   **Rib markings** (indentations of ribs) are often visible on the surface due to compression of the distended lungs against the chest wall.
    *   **[[Paltauf's Hemorrhages]]**: Large, pale, bluish-red subpleural hemorrhages caused by the rupture of alveolar walls due to increased pressure.
*   **Cut Section:** Profuse, fine, white, lathery **froth** oozes out from the cut surface. Crepitus is heard.

**Medicolegal Significance:**
*   Strong presumptive evidence of **Antemortem Drowning** in a conscious individual.
*   Indicates the victim was alive and actively struggling upon entering the water.

### 2. Edema Aquosum

This condition is seen when the victim enters the water in an **unconscious** state or dies immediately upon submersion without a struggle.

**Mechanism:**
*   The victim is incapacitated (e.g., due to head injury, severe intoxication, epilepsy, or cardiac arrest) before or at the moment of entering the water.
*   There is **no violent respiratory struggle** or churning of air and water.
*   Water enters the lungs passively due to gravity and hydrostatic pressure, flooding the alveoli without forming froth.

**Autopsy Findings:**
*   **Volume:** Lungs are heavy and sodden (water-logged) but **not ballooned** or emphysematous.
*   **Appearance:** They appear dark and boggy. They usually retract/collapse slightly when the chest is opened (unlike emphysema aquosum).
*   **Rib Markings:** Usually absent or less prominent.
*   **Cut Section:** Large amounts of clear or bloody **fluid** (water) pour out freely, but there is **little or no froth**.
*   **Crepitus:** Absent or minimal on cutting.

**Medicolegal Significance:**
*   Suggests the victim was **unconscious** or helpless at the time of submersion.
*   Requires investigation into the cause of unconsciousness (e.g., Toxicology for [[Alcohol]]/drugs, examination for head trauma).

### Comparison Table: Emphysema Aquosum vs. Edema Aquosum

| Feature | Emphysema Aquosum | Edema Aquosum |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Common Name** | Drowning Lung / Wet Drowning | Hydrostatic Lung / Passive Drowning |
| **State of Victim** | Conscious and **struggling** vigorously | **Unconscious** or comatose at submersion |
| **Pathophysiology** | Active churning of Air + Water + Mucus | Passive flooding of airways with water |
| **Lung Volume** | **Voluminous**, balloon out of chest | Heavy, boggy, but **not** ballooned |
| **Margins** | Borders are rounded and meet in midline | Borders are not as distended |
| **Rib Markings** | **Present** (Indentation on surface) | Usually **Absent** |
| **Cut Section** | Fine, white, lathery **froth** oozes out | Watery **fluid** pours out; No/minimal froth |
| **Crepitus** | Present | Absent |
| **Paltauf's Hemorrhages** | Commonly seen (50% cases) | Absent |
| **Significance** | **Antemortem drowning** with struggle | Drowning while unconscious |
