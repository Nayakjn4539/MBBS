# [[Regional Conditions]] > Intervertebral Disc Prolapse

### Intervertebral Disc Prolapse (IVDP) and Sciatica

**Definition**
[[Intervertebral Disc Prolapse]] (IVDP) refers to the protrusion or extrusion of the gelatinous [[nucleus pulposus]] through a tear in the fibrous [[annulus fibrosus]]. This displacement often compresses the adjacent [[spinal nerve roots]] or the [[spinal cord]] (in cervical/thoracic regions) or [[cauda equina]] (in lumbar regions).

**Relevant Anatomy and Physiology**
The [[intervertebral disc]] constitutes about 25% of the spinal column's length and functions as a shock absorber. It consists of:
1.  **[[Nucleus Pulposus]]:** A central, hydrophilic, gelatinous core (Type II collagen, proteoglycans, water).
2.  **[[Annulus Fibrosus]]:** Peripheral concentric rings of fibrocartilage (Type I collagen). The annulus is thinner posteriorly, making this area vulnerable to herniation.
3.  **[[Cartilaginous Endplates]]:** Sandwich the disc superiorly and inferiorly.

**Etiology and Risk Factors**
*   **Age:** Degenerative changes (spondylosis) lead to dehydration of the nucleus.
*   **Trauma:** Lifting heavy weights with the back flexed (flexion + compression force).
*   **Occupation:** Sedentary lifestyle, truck driving (vibration), heavy manual labor.
*   **Constitutional:** Smoking, obesity, weak abdominal muscles.

### Pathogenesis and Stages of Herniation
The degenerative process typically follows four stages:
1.  **Disc Degeneration/Bulge:** The nucleus loses turgor; annulus weakens but remains intact.
2.  **Protrusion:** The nucleus bulges eccentrically against the annulus but is still contained.
3.  **Extrusion:** The annulus ruptures, and nuclear material squeezes out but remains attached to the disc space (subligamentous).
4.  **Sequestration:** A fragment of the nucleus detaches completely and migrates into the spinal canal (free fragment).

### Clinical Features
**Symptoms**
*   **[[Low Back Pain]] (LBP):** Usually the first symptom. Dull, aching pain exacerbated by coughing, sneezing, or straining (Valsalva maneuver).
*   **[[Sciatica]]:** Sharp, shooting pain radiating from the buttock down the posterior thigh and leg to the foot. This occurs when the [[sciatic nerve]] roots are irritated.
*   **Neurogenic Claudication:** Pain/heaviness in legs on walking (suggests associated [[spinal stenosis]]).
*   **Cauda Equina Syndrome (Red Flag):** Bilateral sciatica, saddle anesthesia (perianal numbness), and bowel/bladder dysfunction (retention or incontinence). **This is a surgical emergency.**

**Signs (The "Look, Feel, Move" Approach)**
*   **Look (Posture):**
    *   Loss of normal [[lumbar lordosis]] (flat back).
    *   **Sciatic Scoliosis (List):** The trunk tilts to one side to relieve root pressure.
        *   *Tilt to the opposite side:* If the disc is lateral to the nerve root (Shoulder type).
        *   *Tilt to the same side:* If the disc is medial to the nerve root (Axillary type).
*   **Feel:** Tenderness at the lumbosacral junction or interspinous space. Paraspinal muscle spasm.
*   **Move:** Restriction of spinal movements, particularly flexion.

### Special Tests (Tension Signs)
1.  **[[Straight Leg Raising Test]] (SLRT):**
    *   With the patient supine, the leg is lifted passively.
    *   **Positive:** Radiating pain (not just hamstring tightness) produced between 30° and 70°.
    *   *Significance:* Indicates nerve root tension (L5 or S1).
2.  **Lasegue’s Test:** Modification of SLRT. Flex hip and knee to 90°, then slowly extend the knee. Pain indicates root tension.
3.  **Bowstring Sign:** Perform SLRT to the point of pain, slightly flex the knee (pain disappears), then apply digital pressure over the [[popliteal fossa]] (tibial nerve). Return of pain confirms root tension.
4.  **Crossed Leg Raising Test (Fajersztajn’s Test):** Lifting the *unaffected* leg causes pain in the *affected* leg. Highly specific for disc herniation.
5.  **Femoral Stretch Test:** Patient prone, knee flexed and hip extended. Pain in anterior thigh indicates high lumbar disc lesion (L2-L3, L3-L4).

### Neurological Level Diagnosis (Lumbar Spine)
In the lumbar spine, a posterolateral herniation usually affects the **traversing nerve root** (the root exiting at the level *below*).
*Example: L4-L5 disc herniation compresses the L5 root.*

| Disc Level | Nerve Root | Motor Weakness (Myotome) | Sensory Loss (Dermatome) | Reflex Change |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **L3 - L4** | **L4** | [[Quadriceps]] (Knee extension), Tibialis Anterior (Dorsiflexion) | Medial leg, Medial malleolus | **Knee Jerk** (Patellar) |
| **L4 - L5** | **L5** | **[[Extensor Hallucis Longus]]** (Big toe extension), Hip abductors | Lateral leg, Dorsum of foot, Big toe | None (or Tibialis Posterior) |
| **L5 - S1** | **S1** | [[Gastrocnemius]]/Soleus (Plantar flexion), Gluteus Maximus | Posterior calf, Lateral foot, Little toe | **Ankle Jerk** (Achilles) |

**Mnemonic for Roots:**
*   **L4:** **4** floor (extension of knee/dorsiflexion foot to clear floor).
*   **L5:** **L**arge Toe extension.
*   **S1:** **S**mall Toe sensation/Standing on tiptoes (plantarflexion).

### Investigations
1.  **Plain X-rays (Lumbosacral Spine AP/Lat):**
    *   Often normal in acute disc prolapse.
    *   May show "disc space narrowing," loss of lordosis, or osteophytes (spondylosis).
    *   Mainly used to rule out bony pathology (infection, tumor, [[spondylolisthesis]]).
2.  **[[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI):**
    *   **Gold Standard.**
    *   Visualizes soft tissues: disc hydration, extent of herniation, nerve root compression, and canal status.
3.  **CT Scan:** Useful for bony anatomy (e.g., calcified disc, bony stenosis) or if MRI is contraindicated.
4.  **Electromyography (EMG):** Rarely needed; helps differentiate peripheral neuropathy from radiculopathy.

### Differential Diagnosis
*   [[Spondylolisthesis]]
*   Vertebral tumors (Metastasis)
*   [[Spinal Tuberculosis]] (Pott's Spine)
*   Lumbar Canal Stenosis (Neurogenic claudication)
*   Ankylosing Spondylitis

### Management

**A. Conservative Treatment (Successful in 90% of cases)**
The natural history of IVDP is favorable; most discs regress or symptoms subside due to decreasing inflammation.
1.  **Rest:** Short period (2-3 days) of bed rest on a firm mattress. Avoid prolonged bed rest as it leads to deconditioning.
2.  **Analgesia:** [[NSAIDs]] (Ibuprofen, Naproxen) and muscle relaxants.
3.  **Positioning:** Semi-Fowler’s position (hips and knees flexed) relaxes the sciatic nerve.
4.  **Physical Therapy:**
    *   Acute phase: Modalities (Heat/Cold, TENS) for pain.
    *   Recovery phase: Spinal extension exercises (McKenzie), core strengthening.
5.  **Epidural Steroid Injections:** For severe radicular pain refractory to oral meds.

**B. Surgical Treatment**
*Indications:*
1.  **Absolute:** [[Cauda Equina Syndrome]] (Emergency), progressive severe motor deficit.
2.  **Relative:** Failure of conservative treatment (pain > 6-12 weeks), intractable pain, recurrent sciatica.

*Procedures:*
1.  **[[Discectomy]] (Open/Fenestration):** Removal of the herniated disc fragment through a small window in the ligamentum flavum.
2.  **[[Microdiscectomy]]:** Use of an operating microscope; smaller incision, faster recovery.
3.  **Endoscopic Discectomy:** Minimally invasive.
4.  **[[Laminectomy]]:** Removal of the lamina (used for central stenosis or large central discs).

**Clinical Implication:**
Post-operatively, patients must be educated on "Back School" principles: proper lifting techniques (bend knees, not back), weight control, and avoiding smoking to prevent recurrence or "Failed Back Surgery Syndrome."
