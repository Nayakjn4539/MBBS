# [[Corrosive Poisons]] > Nitric Acid and Hydrochloric Acid

# Nitric Acid ($HNO_3$)

### Synonyms
*   **Aqua Fortis** (Strong Water)
*   Red Spirit of Nitre
*   Azotic Acid

### Physical Properties and Uses
*   It is a clear, colorless, fuming, heavy liquid.
*   It has a peculiar choking odor.
*   Upon exposure to air or organic matter, it liberates **Nitrogen oxide** fumes (brownish/reddish), giving it a yellowish tinge.
*   **Uses:** Explosives (gun cotton, dynamite), fertilizers, etching metals, glass industry.

### Mechanism of Action
*   **[[Coagulative Necrosis]]:** Like other mineral acids, it causes coagulation of surface proteins.
*   **[[Xanthoproteic Reaction]]:** This is pathognomonic of Nitric acid. It reacts with organic matter (skin, mucosa, clothes) to liberate **Picric Acid**, causing a characteristic **Yellow discoloration**.
    *   *Note:* To differentiate from iodine stains (which are also yellow/brown), apply ammonia. Iodine stains vanish; Nitric acid stains deepen to orange.

### Clinical Features
**1. Local Action (Ingestion):**
*   **Yellow discoloration** of teeth, lips, chin, and mouth.
*   Burning pain in the mouth, pharynx, and abdomen.
*   **Eructation** and abdominal distension are *more severe* than sulfuric acid due to gas formation.
*   **Vomiting:** The vomitus contains shreddy mucosal tissues, yellowish-brown in color, and reacts acid to litmus.
*   **Perforation:** Less common than [[Sulfuric acid]] because the coagulum formed protects deeper tissues (limiting penetration).

**2. Respiratory System (Inhalation of Fumes):**
*   This is a unique danger of Nitric acid due to its volatile nature.
*   Lacrimation, photophobia, irritation of throat.
*   **Delayed Effects:** Symptoms may subside, followed by a latent period, then sudden onset of **[[Pulmonary Edema]]** (chemical pneumonitis), dyspnea, cyanosis, and death from asphyxia.

### Fatal Dose and Fatal Period
*   **Fatal Dose:** 10 to 15 ml.
*   **Fatal Period:** 12 to 24 hours.

### Diagnosis
*   **Copper Test:** Pour gastric contents on copper strips $\rightarrow$ Green color + evolution of reddish-brown fumes.

### Treatment
*   **Immediate dilution:** Water or milk.
*   **Contraindications:** Stomach wash is generally contraindicated (risk of perforation), though some authorities suggest cautious lavage with soft tube within 1 hour. Carbonates/bicarbonates are contraindicated (risk of rupture due to $CO_2$ gas).
*   **Steroids:** For laryngeal edema and to prevent strictures.
*   **Symptomatic:** IV fluids, morphine for pain, tracheostomy if glottic edema is present.

### Autopsy Findings
*   **External:** Yellow stains on clothes and angles of the mouth. Burns may show a "run-down" pattern.
*   **Internal:**
    *   Mucous membrane of the esophagus and stomach is soft, friable, and **stained yellow**.
    *   Stomach wall may be thickened/edematous but perforation is rare.
    *   If death followed fume inhalation: Congested respiratory tract, pulmonary edema, and desquamation of bronchial epithelium.

### Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Suicide:** Occasionally used.
*   **Accidental:** Mistaken for medicine/syrups.
*   **[[Vitriolage]]:** Used, but less common than sulfuric acid.

# Hydrochloric Acid ($HCl$)

### Synonyms
*   **Muriatic Acid**
*   Spirit of Salts

### Physical Properties and Uses
*   Colorless, fuming liquid (commercial variety may be yellowish due to iron impurities).
*   Highly volatile.
*   **Uses:** Bleaching agent, dyeing industry, metal refining, flux for soldering, floor cleaning (bathroom acid).

### Action
*   It is the **least corrosive** among the three strong mineral acids ($H_2SO_4 > HNO_3 > HCl$).
*   It causes necrosis but usually does not cause severe corrosion of the skin unless in high concentration.
*   It readily destroys mucous membranes.

### Clinical Features
**1. Ingestion:**
*   Intense burning sensation in the mouth, throat, and stomach.
*   The mucous membrane initially turns **grey or greyish-white**, later becoming brown/black (due to acid hematin formation).
*   Vomiting of brownish-black matter.
*   **Respiratory complications:** Due to its volatility, fumes are inhaled causing laryngeal spasm, coughing, and [[pulmonary edema]].

**2. Skin Contact:**
*   Usually produces erythema or superficial burns. Severe charring is absent.

### Fatal Dose and Fatal Period
*   **Fatal Dose:** 15 to 20 ml.
*   **Fatal Period:** 18 to 24 hours.

### Diagnosis
*   **Ammonia Test:** Place an open bottle of liquor ammonia near the vomit/gastric contents $\rightarrow$ Copious **white fumes** of [[Ammonium chloride]] are formed.

### Autopsy Findings
*   **Mucosa:** The tongue, pharynx, and esophagus appear whitened/bleached or "scalded". Later they may turn dark.
*   **Stomach:** Intense inflammation. Mucosa is reddened or shows **black streaks** (erosions) along the rugae.
*   **Perforation:** Very **Rare** (Major differentiator from Sulfuric acid).
*   **Kidneys:** May show inflammation/nephritis.

### Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Suicide:** Common due to easy availability as a domestic toilet cleaner.
*   **Accidental:** Mistaking it for other fluids.
*   **Forgery:** Used to erase writing from documents.

### Comparative Table: Mineral Acids

| Feature | Sulfuric Acid | Nitric Acid | Hydrochloric Acid |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Common Name** | Oil of Vitriol | Aqua Fortis | Muriatic Acid / Spirit of Salts |
| **Color of Stain** | **Black** / Dark Brown (Charring) | **Yellow** (Xanthoproteic reaction) | **Greyish-White** (Bleaching) |
| **Fumes** | Non-fuming | Fuming (Nitrous oxide) | Fuming (Hydrogen chloride) |
| **Tissue Damage** | Severe charring | Yellow discoloration | Inflammation/Bleaching |
| **Perforation** | Common | Less Common | Rare |
| **Respiratory Risk**| Minimal (unless aspirated) | High (Delayed pulmonary edema) | High (Laryngeal spasm) |

> **Mnemonic for Stains:**
> *   **S**ulfuric = **S**ooty (Black)
> *   **N**itric = **N**eon/Lemon (Yellow)
> *   **H**ydrochloric = **H**aze (White/Grey)
