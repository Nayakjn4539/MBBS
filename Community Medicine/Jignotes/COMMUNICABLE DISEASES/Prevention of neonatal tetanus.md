# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Prevention of neonatal tetanus

### **Prevention of Neonatal Tetanus**

[[Neonatal Tetanus]] (NNT), historically known as the **"8th Day Disease"** (as the first symptom often appears around the 7th day), is a major preventable cause of neonatal mortality in developing countries. Since Clostridium tetani spores are ubiquitous in the soil and environment, the disease cannot be eradicated, but it can be **eliminated**.

The prevention strategy rests on two main pillars: **Maternal Immunization** and **Clean Delivery Practices**.

### **1. Active Immunization of the Mother**
This is the most effective method. It induces the production of protective antibodies (IgG) in the mother, which cross the placenta and provide [[Passive Immunity]] to the newborn for the first few months of life,.

**Immunization Schedule for Pregnant Women:**

| Status of Mother | Dosage | Timing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unimmunized** | 2 Doses of [[Tetanus Toxoid]] (TT/Td) | **1st Dose:** As early as possible in pregnancy (16-20 weeks). <br> **2nd Dose:** At least 4 weeks after the first (preferably 3 weeks before delivery). |
| **Previously Immunized** | 1 Booster Dose | If the last pregnancy/vaccination was within the last 3 years. |

> **Clinical Relevance:** In developing countries, if a pregnant woman presents late in pregnancy, **never deny the dose**. Give the first dose immediately, even if delivery is imminent. It may not fully protect the current baby, but it primes the mother for future protection.

### **2. Clean Delivery Practices (The "5 Cleans")**
Infection is usually acquired through the contamination of the umbilical stump (e.g., cutting the cord with a rusty blade, applying cow dung or ash to the stump). To prevent this, the **"5 Cleans"** must be strictly followed during delivery, especially in home settings.

#### **The 5 Cleans:**
1.  **Clean Hands** (of the birth attendant).
2.  **Clean Surface** (for delivery).
3.  **Clean Cord Cut** (using a new sterile blade).
4.  **Clean Cord Tie** (sterile thread).
5.  **Clean Cord Stump** (No application of anything on the stump),.

**Update:** Under RCH-III, **"7 Cleans"** are suggested, adding:
6.  **Clean Water** (for hand washing).
7.  **Clean Towel** (for drying hands),.

### **3. Management of Baby Born to Unimmunized Mother**
If a mother has **not** received the 2 doses of TT/Td, or if the delivery was unhygienic, the newborn is at high risk.

*   **Passive Immunization:** Administer **750 IU** of [[Tetanus Antitoxin]] (Heterologous serum/Equine) to the baby.
*   **Timing:** Must be given within **6 hours** of birth to be effective,.

### **4. Elimination Strategies**
The goal is **Elimination**, not Eradication (because the reservoir is soil).

*   **Definition of Elimination:** Less than **1 case of N
