# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Tuberculosis is an old disease but a new threat

### **Tuberculosis: An Old Disease, A New Threat**

**Tuberculosis (TB)** is often described as a **"Barometer of Social Welfare"**. Despite the discovery of the causative agent over a century ago and the availability of effective chemotherapy, TB remains a global emergency and a massive public health challenge,.

---

### **1. Why is it an "Old" Disease?**
*   **Ancient History:** TB is a disease of antiquity.
*   **Discovery:** The causative agent, **[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]**, was discovered by **Robert Koch** in **1882**.
*   **Established Cure:** Highly effective drugs (like Streptomycin and Isoniazid) and vaccines ([[BCG]]) have been available for decades, theoretically making it a preventable and curable disease.

---

### **2. Why is it a "New" Threat?**
The resurgence of TB is driven by a complex interaction of biological, social, and environmental factors. It is no longer just a simple bacterial infection but a multi-faceted syndemic.

#### **A. The Lethal Partnership: [[TB-HIV Co-infection]]**
HIV is the most potent risk factor for the progression of latent TB infection to active disease.
*   **Mechanism:** HIV destroys the immune system (CD4 cells), allowing the bacillus to multiply rapidly.
*   **Risk Amplification:**
    *   **Normal Host:** 10% *lifetime* risk of developing active TB.
    *   **HIV Positive Host:** 10% *annual* risk of developing active TB.
*   **Mortality:** TB is the leading cause of death among **[[People Living with HIV]] (PLHIV)**.

#### **B. The Man-Made Monster: Drug Resistance**
Resistance is a **man-made phenomenon** caused by poor treatment adherence, inadequate regimens, or poor drug quality.

| **Type of Resistance** | **Definition** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[MDR-TB]]** (Multi-Drug Resistant) | Resistance to at least **Isoniazid (H)** and **Rifampicin (R)**,. |
| **[[XDR-TB]]** (Extensively Drug Resistant) | MDR + Resistance to any **Fluoroquinolone** + at least one **Group A drug** (Bedaquiline/Linezolid). *(Note: Older definitions included injectable second-line drugs).* |
| **[[TDR-TB]]** (Totally Drug Resistant) | Resistance to **ALL** available first-line and second-line anti-TB drugs. |

*   **Impact:** MDR-TB is difficult to treat, requires toxic drugs, takes longer (up to 2 years), and has poor outcomes.

#### **C. The Emerging Co-morbidities**
*   **[[Diabetes Mellitus]]:** Accounts for **20%** of all TB cases. Diabetics have a **2-3 times higher risk** of progressing to active TB.
*   **Tobacco Smoking:** 38% of TB deaths are associated with tobacco use. Prevalence is **3 times higher** in smokers.

#### **D. Social Determinants & Migration**
*   **Urbanization:** Growth of slums and overcrowding facilitates droplet transmission,.
*   **Migration:** Movement of laborers spreads infection from high-burden to low-burden areas.

### **3. The Strategic Response: Fighting the New Threat**

To counter these threats, the Global and National strategies have evolved from **Control** to **Elimination**.

#### **A. Evolution of Program**
*   **NTCP (1962):** Failed due to low cure rates.
*   **RNTCP (1993/1997):** Adopted the **[[DOTS strategy]]** (Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course),.
*   **[[NTEP]] (2020):** Renamed to **National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme**.
    *   **Goal:** Eliminate TB by **2025** (5 years ahead of global SDG targets).
    *   **Vision:** TB-Free India with zero deaths, disease, and poverty due to TB.

#### **B. New Diagnostics & Treatment**
*   **Universal DST:** Shift from simple microscopy to **[[CBNAAT]] (GeneXpert)** and **TrueNat** for early detection of Rifampicin resistance.
*   **Daily Regimen:** Replacement of intermittent (thrice-weekly) regimen with daily **Fixed Dose Combinations (FDCs)**.
*   **New Drugs:** Introduction of **[[Bedaquiline]]** and **Delamanid** for resistant cases.
*   **ICT Support:** **[[NIKSHAY]]** portal for web-based surveillance and patient tracking.

### **Clinical Relevance: The "missed" Diagnosis**
In the era of the "New Threat," a clinician must suspect TB not just in patients with cough > 2 weeks, but also in:
*   **PLHIV** with *any* duration of cough or fever.
*   **Diabetics** with uncontrolled sugar levels.
*   **MDR suspects:** Patients who are "Contact of DR-TB" or "Non-responders" to first-line treatment.

### **Mnemonic for TB Threats**

**"HADES"** is the god of the underworld (death), representing the lethal nature of modern TB.

*   **H** - **H**IV Co-infection (The lethal duo)
*   **A** - **A**nti-microbial Resistance (MDR/XDR/TDR)
*   **D** - **D**iabetes Mellitus (The looming epidemic)
*   **E** - **E**conomic/Social factors (Poverty, Migration, Slums)
*   **S** - **S**moking & Tobacco use
