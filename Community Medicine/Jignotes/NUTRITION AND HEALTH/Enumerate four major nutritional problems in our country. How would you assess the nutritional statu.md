# [[NUTRITION AND HEALTH]] > Enumerate four major nutritional problems in our country. How would you assess the nutritional status of the under five in a community?

### Major Nutritional Problems in India

From the nutritional point of view, the Indian society is a dual society, consisting of a small group of well-fed and a very large group of undernourished. The four major nutritional problems affecting vast segments of the population are:

**1. [[Protein Energy Malnutrition]] (PEM)**
*   **Cause:** Primarily due to the **"Food Gap"** (inadequate intake of food in both quantity and quality) rather than just a protein gap.
*   **Vicious Cycle:** It is closely linked with infections (diarrhea, respiratory infections, measles). *Infection contributes to malnutrition and malnutrition contributes to infection.*
*   **Magnitude:** It is a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality. The spectrum ranges from **growth faltering** (mild/moderate) to florid clinical forms like **Kwashiorkor** and **Marasmus**.
*   **Current Status:** While severe cases (<1%) have declined, **Underweight** (approx 32%) and **Stunting** (approx 35%) remain high among under-fives.

**2. [[Nutritional Anaemia]]**
*   **Cause:** By far the most frequent cause is **Iron Deficiency**, followed by folate and Vitamin B12 deficiency. Contributing factors include low dietary intake, poor bioavailability (phytates in diet), and hookworm infestation.
*   **Vulnerable Groups:** Women of reproductive age and young children.
*   **Impact:** Leads to weakness, reduced work capacity, and increased maternal mortality (approx 20% of maternal deaths).

**3. [[Vitamin A Deficiency]] (Nutritional Blindness)**
*   **Cause:** Inadequate intake of carotene-rich foods and frequent infections.
*   **Impact:** It is the single most frequent cause of preventable blindness in children.
*   **Manifestations:** Ranges from Night Blindness (earliest symptom) to **Bitot’s Spots** (epidemiological marker) and Keratomalacia (irreversible blindness).

**4. [[Iodine Deficiency Disorders]] (IDD)**
*   **Nature:** It is an environmental problem (soil deficiency) rather than just dietary.
*   **Impact:** It causes a spectrum of disabilities, not just Goitre. The most severe effect is **Cretinism** and mental retardation. It affects physical and mental development.
*   **Magnitude:** No longer limited to the sub-Himalayan "Goitre Belt"; it is now recognized as a national problem.

### Assessment of Nutritional Status of Under-Fives in a Community

Assessment of nutritional status involves various techniques to determine the health of individuals or population groups. For under-five children, who are the most vulnerable group, the assessment is categorized into **Direct** and **Indirect** methods.

#### **A. Direct Methods (Mnemonic: ABCD)**

**1. [[Anthropometry]] (Measurements of Physical Growth)**
This is the most practical and widely used method for community assessment of under-fives.

*   **Weight-for-Age:**
    *   The most sensitive measure of growth.
    *   Used in **[[Growth Charts]]** (Road-to-Health charts) at Anganwadis to detect growth faltering.
    *   **Interpretation:** Detects *Underweight* (Acute + Chronic malnutrition).
*   **Height-for-Age:**
    *   Measures linear growth.
    *   Low height-for-age indicates **Stunting** (Chronic malnutrition/long-term deprivation).
*   **Weight-for-Height:**
    *   Low weight-for-height indicates **Wasting** (Acute malnutrition/current nutritional crisis).
*   **Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC):**
    *   **Best for rapid field screening** because it remains relatively constant between ages 1 to 5 years.
    *   **Tool:** **Shakir’s Tape** (Colored tape).
    *   **Interpretation:**
        *   **Red (< 11.5 cm):** Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM).
        *   **Yellow (11.5 – 12.5 cm):** Moderate Malnutrition.
        *   **Green (> 12.5 cm):** Normal.

**2. Biochemical Evaluation**
Used to detect sub-clinical deficiencies before physical signs appear.
*   **Haemoglobin estimation:** To detect Anaemia (Hb < 11 g/dl in children).
*   **Stool Examination:** To check for ova and cysts (Hookworm, Ascaris) which contribute to malnutrition.
*   **Serum Retinol:** To assess Vitamin A status.

**3. Clinical Examination**
Physical examination for specific signs of malnutrition. *Note: Signs appear late in the disease process.*

| Nutritional Disorder | Clinical Signs to Look For |
| :--- | :--- |
| **PEM** | Edema, muscle wasting, moon face, flag sign (hair), pot belly. |
| **Vitamin A Deficiency** | Night blindness, Bitot’s spots, conjunctival xerosis. |
| **Vitamin D Deficiency** | Rickets (Bow legs, knock knees, pigeon chest). |
| **Anaemia** | Pallor of conjunctiva, tongue, nail beds; koilonychia. |
| **Vitamin B Complex** | Angular stomatitis, cheilosis, glossitis. |

**4. Dietary Assessment (Diet Survey)**
*   **24-Hour Recall Method:** Most suitable for community surveys. The mother is asked about the child's intake over the last 24 hours.
*   **Weighment Method:** Weighing raw/cooked food (Gold standard but time-consuming).
*   **Assessment:** Check for intake of Calories, Proteins, and Protective foods compared to RDA.

#### **B. Indirect Methods**

These utilize vital statistics and ecological factors to infer the nutritional status of the community.

1.  **Vital Statistics:**
    *   **Infant Mortality Rate (IMR):** High IMR often correlates with poor nutrition.
    *   **Under-5 Mortality Rate:** A key indicator of child survival and nutritional status.
    *   **1-4 Year Mortality Rate:** Specifically reflects environmental and nutritional health (post-weaning period).
    *   **Cause-specific Mortality:** Deaths due to measles or diarrhea often have malnutrition as an underlying cause.

2.  **Ecological Factors:**
    *   **Socio-economic status:** Income, family size, overcrowding.
    *   **Health Services:** Coverage of immunization, Vitamin A prophylaxis, ICDS services.
    *   **Environmental Sanitation:** Water supply and excreta disposal (linked to worm infestation and diarrhea).

**Clinical Relevance:**
Early detection of growth faltering using the **Growth Chart** allows for timely intervention (supplementary nutrition, education) before the child develops severe malnutrition like Marasmus or Kwashiorkor.

**Mnemonic for Assessment Methods: ABCD**
*   **A**nthropometry
*   **B**iochemical
*   **C**linical
*   **D**ietary / **D**emographic (Vital stats)
