# [[Thyroid Gland]] > Evaluation of Thyroid Nodule

### **Introduction to Thyroid Nodule**

A [[Thyroid Nodule]] is a discrete lesion within the thyroid gland that is radiologically distinct from the surrounding thyroid parenchyma,. They are common clinical findings, palpable in 4–7% of the adult population, but detectable in up to 50% via high-resolution ultrasound,.

*   **Prevalence:** Increases with age.
*   **Gender:** More common in females.
*   **Malignancy Risk:** While 90-95% are benign (colloid nodules, cysts, thyroiditis), approximately 5-10% are malignant,.
*   **Key Challenge:** The primary goal of evaluation is to distinguish the small number of malignant nodules requiring surgery from the majority of benign nodules that can be observed.

### **Pertinent Anatomy and Physiology**

*   **Location:** The [[Thyroid Gland]] is a butterfly-shaped organ wrapping around the anterolateral trachea.
*   **Relations:**
    *   **Nerves:** The [[Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve]] (RLN) runs in the tracheoesophageal groove. Involvement by a nodule may cause hoarseness,.
    *   **Berry’s Ligament:** Fixes the gland to the cricoid/trachea, causing the gland (and nodules) to move up with deglutition.
*   **Lymphatic Drainage:**
    *   **Central Compartment (Level VI):** Prelaryngeal (Delphian), pretracheal, paratracheal.
    *   **Lateral Neck (Levels II–V):** Jugular chain and posterior triangle,.
*   **Physiology:** The gland produces T3/T4 (follicular cells) and [[Calcitonin]] (parafollicular C-cells). TSH from the pituitary regulates growth and function.

### **Clinical Evaluation**

#### **1. History**
A detailed history helps stratify the risk of malignancy.

**Red Flags for Malignancy (High Risk Factors):**
*   **Age:** Extremes of age ($<20$ years or $>60$ years). Nodules in children have a higher malignancy risk (~30%).
*   **Gender:** Male gender (nodules are less common in men, but more likely to be malignant).
*   **Growth:** Rapid increase in size (over weeks/months).
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Pain:** Can indicate haemorrhage into a cyst or invasive malignancy (e.g., anaplastic),.
    *   **Compressive symptoms:** Dysphagia (oesophageal compression), dyspnea/stridor (tracheal compression).
    *   **Hoarseness:** Suggests RLN invasion,.
*   **History:**
    *   Prior head/neck irradiation (increases risk of [[Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma]]).
    *   Family history of [[Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma]] (MTC), MEN 2 syndrome, or Papillary cancer,.

#### **2. Physical Examination**
**Inspection:**
*   Check for midline neck mass moving with swallowing.
*   **Pemberton’s Sign:** Used to detect retrosternal goiter. Elevating arms above the head causes facial congestion/cyanosis/distress due to thoracic inlet obstruction.

**Palpation:**
*   **Methods:** Palpation from behind (Lahey’s method) or front.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Consistency:** Hard/firm nodules suggest malignancy; soft/cystic suggests benign,.
    *   **Fixity:** Fixation to strap muscles or trachea indicates invasion.
    *   **Solitary vs. Multinodular:** Historically solitary nodules were considered higher risk, but malignancy risk is similar in dominant nodules of multinodular goiters.
*   **Cervical Lymphadenopathy:** Palpate lateral neck compartments. Presence of a firm, non-tender node with a thyroid nodule suggests malignancy.
*   **Berry’s Sign:** Absence of carotid pulsation due to encasement by malignant thyroid enlargement.

### **Investigations**

#### **1. Laboratory Tests**
*   **Serum TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone):** **First-line test.**
    *   **Low TSH:** Suggests a hyperfunctioning ("hot") nodule. Next step $\rightarrow$ Radionuclide scan,.
    *   **Normal/High TSH:** Nodule is non-functioning ("cold"). Next step $\rightarrow$ Ultrasound/FNAC.
*   **Serum Calcitonin:** Screening test if MTC or MEN syndrome is suspected,.
*   **Thyroglobulin:** Not useful for initial diagnosis (nonspecific); used for follow-up after total thyroidectomy to detect recurrence,.
*   **Thyroid Antibodies:** Anti-TPO and Anti-thyroglobulin for [[Hashimoto's Thyroiditis]].

#### **2. Ultrasound (USG) of Neck**
This is the **most important imaging modality** for characterization. It differentiates solid from cystic lesions and identifies suspicious features.

**Ultrasound Features Suggesting Malignancy:**
*   **Echogenicity:** Hypoechoic (darker than surrounding tissue),.
*   **Composition:** Solid (higher risk) vs. Cystic (lower risk).
*   **Margins:** Irregular, infiltrative, or microlobulated.
*   **Calcification:** Microcalcifications (associated with Psammoma bodies in Papillary Carcinoma),.
*   **Shape:** Taller-than-wide shape (AP diameter > Transverse diameter).
*   **Vascularity:** Central/Intranodular vascularity,.
*   **Halo:** Absence of peripheral halo.

**Mnemonic for Malignant USG Features: "HIM - CV"**
*   **H**ypoechoic
*   **I**rregular margins
*   **M**icrocalcifications
*   **C**entral vascularity
*   **V**ertical growth (Taller than wide)

#### **3. Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC)**
*   **Status:** **Gold standard** for evaluating thyroid nodules,.
*   **Indication:** Solid nodules >1cm, or smaller nodules with suspicious USG features.
*   **Guidance:** USG-guided FNAC is superior to palpation-guided, reducing sampling error.
*   **Reporting:** Results are categorized using the **Bethesda System** or **THY classification**,.

**Table: Management based on Cytology (Bethesda/THY System)**-,

| Diagnostic Category | Risk of Malignancy | Suggested Management |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Non-diagnostic / Insufficient** | 0–10% | Repeat FNAC with USG guidance. |
| **Benign** (Colloid nodule, Thyroiditis) | 0–3% | Clinical follow-up / Observation. |
| **Atypia / Follicular Lesion of Undetermined Significance (FLUS)** | 5–15% | Repeat FNAC. |
| **Follicular Neoplasm / Suspicious for Follicular Neoplasm** | 15–30% | Diagnostic Lobectomy (Hemithyroidectomy). *Cytology cannot distinguish follicular adenoma from carcinoma; histology is needed to check capsular/vascular invasion*. |
| **Suspicious for Malignancy** | 60–75% | Surgery (Total Thyroidectomy or Lobectomy). |
| **Malignant** (Papillary, Medullary, Anaplastic) | 97–99% | Surgery (Total Thyroidectomy +/- Neck Dissection). |

#### **4. Radionuclide Scanning (Scintigraphy)**
*   **Isotopes:** Technetium-99m (Tc99m) or Iodine-123 (I-123),.
*   **Indication:** Performed when **TSH is low** to check functional status.
*   **Findings:**
    *   **Hot Nodule:** Hyperfunctioning. Rarely malignant (<1%). Usually treated with radioiodine or surgery for toxicity,.
    *   **Cold Nodule:** Non-functioning. Risk of malignancy is ~10–20%. Requires FNAC.
    *   **Warm Nodule:** Normal uptake.

#### **5. CT / MRI / PET Scan**
*   **CT/MRI:** Not for routine nodule evaluation. Useful to assess **retrosternal extension**, airway compression, or extent of large invasive carcinomas,.
*   **PET Scan:** Useful for detecting metastases in known cancer or evaluating FDG-avid nodules (high malignancy risk ~40%).

### **Management Principles**

**The "4 Cs" Indications for Thyroid Surgery:**
1.  **C**ancer (Confirmed or Suspicious on FNAC).
2.  **C**ompression (Trachea/Esophagus causing dyspnea/dysphagia).
3.  **C**osmesis (Large goiter).
4.  **C**ompliance/Concern (Patient anxiety or suspicion).

**Specific Scenarios:**
*   **Benign Nodule:** Observation with serial ultrasound. Levothyroxine suppression therapy is generally *not* preferred due to side effects (arrhythmias, osteoporosis),.
*   **Cystic Nodule:** Aspiration. If recurrent >4cm, excision.
*   **Follicular Neoplasm:** Diagnostic hemithyroidectomy (lobectomy) is required to rule out carcinoma. If histology confirms carcinoma $\rightarrow$ Completion thyroidectomy.
*   **Malignancy:**
    *   **Papillary:** Total Thyroidectomy (usually). Neck dissection if nodes involved.
    *   **Medullary:** Total Thyroidectomy + Central Neck Dissection.
    *   **Anaplastic:** Palliative care / Chemoradiation / Tracheostomy for airway.

**Clinical Implication:**
In follicular lesions, **FNAC cannot distinguish benign adenoma from malignant carcinoma** because the diagnosis of carcinoma relies on histological evidence of **capsular or vascular invasion**, which cannot be seen on cytology smears. Therefore, surgical excision (diagnostic lobectomy) is mandatory for "Follicular Neoplasm" cytology.
