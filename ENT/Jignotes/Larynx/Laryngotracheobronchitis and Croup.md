# Laryngotracheobronchitis (Croup)

**Laryngotracheobronchitis (LTB)**, commonly referred to as **Croup**, is an acute inflammatory condition of the upper and lower respiratory tract, predominantly involving the [[larynx]], trachea, and bronchi. It is the most common cause of acute airway obstruction in children.

### Epidemiology
*   **Age:** Primarily affects children between **6 months and 3 years** of age.
*   **Sex:** Males are more commonly affected than females.
*   **Season:** More prevalent in autumn and winter months.
*   **Nature:** Usually a self-limiting condition, but severe cases can be life-threatening due to [[airway obstruction]].

### Etiology
The condition is primarily viral in origin, though secondary bacterial invasion can occur.

*   **Primary Viral Agents:**
    *   **Parainfluenza virus** (Types I and II) - *Most common cause* (75-80% of cases).
    *   [[Influenza virus]] type A and B.
    *   Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV).
    *   Adenovirus and Measles virus.
*   **Secondary Bacterial Agents:**
    *   *Staphylococcus aureus*
    *   *Streptococcus pyogenes*
    *   *Streptococcus pneumoniae*
    *   *Haemophilus influenzae*

### Pathophysiology
1.  **Infection:** The virus spreads from the nasopharynx to the larynx and trachea.
2.  **Edema:** The hallmark pathology is mucosal edema in the **subglottic region** (loose areolar tissue).
    *   *Note:* The [[cricoid cartilage]] is a complete ring; swelling here cannot expand outward, so it encroaches inward, critically narrowing the airway.
3.  **Obstruction:** The narrowed lumen combined with thick, tenacious secretions and crusting leads to respiratory obstruction.
4.  **Airflow Dynamics:** Narrowing causes turbulent airflow, manifesting as [[stridor]].
5.  **Respiratory Failure:** If untreated, severe obstruction leads to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory arrest.

### Clinical Features
The disease typically follows a gradual course (unlike [[Acute Epiglottitis]] which is abrupt).

*   **Prodromal Stage:** History of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) with mild fever, runny nose, and malaise for 1–3 days.
*   **Classic Triad:**
    1.  **Barking Cough:** Often described as "seal-like" or "brassy."
    2.  **Hoarseness of Voice:** Due to inflammation of the vocal cords.
    3.  **Inspiratory Stridor:** High-pitched sound due to subglottic narrowing.
*   **Progression:**
    *   Symptoms are typically **worse at night**.
    *   As obstruction increases: [[Stridor]] may become biphasic (inspiratory and expiratory).
    *   **Respiratory Distress:** Suprasternal and intercostal recessions, nasal flaring, and tachypnea.
    *   **Late Signs:** Cyanosis, lethargy, and decreased air entry (silent chest) indicate impending respiratory failure.

**Clinical Implication:** Do not be reassured if the stridor becomes quieter while the child looks more exhausted/lethargic; this may signal a decrease in airflow and impending arrest.

### Diagnosis
Diagnosis is primarily clinical. Imaging is used to rule out other pathologies like foreign bodies or epiglottitis.

**1. Radiography (X-ray Neck)**
*   **View:** Antero-posterior (AP) view.
*   **Finding:** **Steeple Sign** (also known as Pencil Tip sign).
    *   This appears as a symmetric, tapered narrowing of the [[subglottic trachea]] resembling an inverted 'V' or a church steeple.
*   **Lateral View:** Shows a normal epiglottis (differentiating it from epiglottitis) and subglottic haziness.

**2. Laboratory**
*   **Leukocytosis:** May be present, especially if secondary bacterial infection occurs.
*   **Pulse Oximetry:** To monitor oxygen saturation.

**3. Endoscopy**
*   **Direct Laryngoscopy:** Generally **avoided** in acute stages as it may precipitate laryngeal spasm and complete obstruction. It is reserved for cases where the diagnosis is unclear or intubation is required.

### Differential Diagnosis: Croup vs. Epiglottitis

| Feature | Acute Laryngotracheobronchitis (Croup) | Acute Epiglottitis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Site** | Subglottis | Supraglottis |
| **Organism** | Viral (Parainfluenza) | Bacterial (*H. influenzae* type B) |
| **Onset** | Gradual (days) | Abrupt (hours) |
| **Cough** | **Barking / Seal-like** | Absent / Muffled |
| **Dysphagia** | Absent / Mild | **Severe** (Drooling of saliva) |
| **Posture** | Supine preferred | Tripod position (sitting up, leaning forward) |
| **Fever** | Low grade | High grade (Toxic look) |
| **X-ray Sign** | **Steeple Sign** (AP view) | **Thumb Sign** (Lateral view) |

### Management
**Medical Emergency:** Assessment of airway patency is the priority.

#### 1. General Measures
*   **Hospitalization:** Required for children with stridor at rest, respiratory distress, or cyanosis.
*   **Minimal Handling:** Avoid procedures that agitate the child (venipuncture, throat examination) to prevent worsening stridor.
*   **Hydration:** Intravenous fluids to combat dehydration and liquefy secretions.
*   **Humidification:** Cool mist or humidified oxygen helps soften crusts and secretions.

#### 2. Pharmacotherapy
*   **Corticosteroids (Mainstay of treatment):**
    *   Reduces subglottic edema.
    *   **Dexamethasone** (0.6 mg/kg IM/IV/Oral stat) or **Budesonide** (nebulized).
*   **Nebulized Epinephrine:**
    *   **Racemic Epinephrine** or **L-Epinephrine** (1:1000).
    *   Mechanism: Causes mucosal vasoconstriction, rapidly reducing edema.
    *   Effect is transient (rebound edema may occur), requiring close observation.
*   **Antibiotics:**
    *   Indicated only if secondary bacterial infection (e.g., *S. aureus*) is suspected or if the patient has high fever and purulent secretions. (e.g., [[Cephalosporins]]).
*   **Heliox:**
    *   A mixture of **Helium (70-80%)** and **Oxygen (20-30%)**.
    *   Lower density than air facilitates laminar flow through the narrowed airway, reducing the work of breathing.

#### 3. Airway Intervention
Indicated if the child has increasing hypoxia, hypercapnia (rising CO2), exhaustion, or obtunded mental status.
*   **Endotracheal Intubation:** Preferred over tracheostomy. A tube smaller than the age-predicted size is used to avoid trauma to the swollen subglottis.
*   **Tracheostomy:** Rarely needed; reserved for failures of intubation or prolonged ventilation requirements.

### Complications
*   Extension of infection: **Bacterial Tracheitis** (pseudomembranous croup), pneumonia.
*   Otitis Media.
*   Dehydration.
*   Subglottic stenosis (long-term sequela).
*   Respiratory Arrest.

### Mnemonic
To remember the features of Croup: **STRIDOR**
*   **S**teeple sign on X-ray
*   **T**rouble breathing (Inspiratory Stridor)
*   **R**espiratory infection (Viral prodrome)
*   **I**nspiratory stridor (worse at night)
*   **D**examethasone (Steroids are key)
*   **O**nset gradual
*   **R**acemic epinephrine (for severe cases)
