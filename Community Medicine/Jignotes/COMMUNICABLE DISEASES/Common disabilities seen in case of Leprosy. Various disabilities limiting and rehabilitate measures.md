# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Common disabilities seen in case of Leprosy. Various disabilities limiting and rehabilitate measures in Leprosy

### Common Disabilities in Leprosy (Hansen's Disease)

[[Leprosy]] is a chronic infectious disease caused by [[Mycobacterium leprae]] affecting peripheral nerves, skin, and eyes. It is a leading cause of permanent physical disability due to nerve damage and subsequent trauma to insensitive parts,.

#### 1. WHO Grading of Disabilities
The World Health Organization classifies disabilities into three grades to monitor the disease burden.

| Grade | **Eyes** | **Hands** | **Feet** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | No eye problem due to leprosy; no evidence of visual loss. | No anesthesia, no visible deformity or damage. | No anesthesia, no visible deformity or damage. |
| **1** | Eye involvement present but vision is **6/60 or better**; can count fingers at 6 meters. | Anesthesia present, but **no visible deformity** or damage. | Anesthesia present, but **no visible deformity** or damage. |
| **2** | Severe visual impairment (vision **<6/60**); inability to count fingers at 6 meters; Lagophthalmos; iridocyclitis; corneal opacities. | Visible deformity or damage present (e.g., [[Claw hand]], ulcers, absorption of digits). | Visible deformity or damage present (e.g., [[Foot drop]], plantar ulcers). |

*Clinical Relevance:* The highest grade given to any part is the patient's overall Disability Grade. Grade 2 disability rate is a key indicator of delayed diagnosis.

#### 2. Specific Deformities by Region
Deformities arise from nerve paralysis, disease processes (infiltration), or secondary infections.

| Region | Nerve Involved | Clinical Manifestation (Deformity) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Face** | Facial Nerve | **[[Facies Leonina]]** (Lion face), **[[Lagophthalmos]]** (inability to close eyes), **Sagging face**, loss of eyebrows/eyelashes (Madarosis), depressed nose (saddle nose), perforated palate,. |
| **Hands** | **[[Ulnar Nerve]]** | **[[Claw hand]]** (partial or complete), wasting of hypothenar eminence. |
| | **[[Median Nerve]]** | **Ape thumb** deformity, inability to oppose thumb. |
| | **[[Radial Nerve]]** | **[[Wrist drop]]** (inability to extend wrist),. |
| **Feet** | **[[Lateral Popliteal Nerve]]** | **[[Foot drop]]** (inability to dorsiflex foot), inversion of foot,. |
| | **[[Posterior Tibial Nerve]]** | **[[Claw toes]]**, anesthesia of sole leading to **[[Plantar ulcers]]**. |

### Disability Prevention and Limitation (POD)

The primary goal is to prevent the transition from *impairment* (nerve damage) to *disability* and *handicap*,.

**1. Early Detection and Treatment:**
*   Rapid administration of **[[Multi-Drug Therapy (MDT)]]** kills bacilli and prevents further nerve damage.
*   Management of **[[Lepra Reactions]]** (Type 1 and 2) using corticosteroids (e.g., Prednisolone) is crucial to prevent acute nerve paralysis,.

**2. Care of Hands and Feet (Self-Care):**
*   **Inspection:** Daily check for blisters, cracks, or thorns on anesthetic skin.
*   **Soaking and Oiling:** Soak feet in water to hydrate and apply oil to retain moisture (prevents cracks in dry, denervated skin).
*   **Protection:** Use of protective gloves for manual work (cooking/farming) to prevent burns and injuries.
*   **Footwear:** Use of **[[Micro-Cellular Rubber (MCR)]]** footwear to distribute pressure evenly and prevent plantar ulcers,.

**3. Care of Eyes:**
*   Regular checking for redness or debris.
*   Use of sunglasses to protect from dust/sunlight.
*   Active blinking exercises to prevent exposure keratitis in lagophthalmos.

### Rehabilitation Measures

Rehabilitation is the combined use of medical, social, educational, and vocational measures to train the individual to the highest possible level of functional ability,.

**1. Medical Rehabilitation:**
*   **Reconstructive Surgery (RCS):** Correction of fixed deformities like claw hand (tendon transfer), foot drop, and lagophthalmos to restore function and appearance,.
*   **Ulcer Care:** Management of chronic plantar ulcers through rest, dressing, and plaster casts.
*   **Prosthetics:** Provision of artificial limbs for amputees.

**2. Vocational Rehabilitation:**
*   Training the patient in suitable trades (e.g., tailoring, weaving) where anesthesia or deformity does not hinder productivity.
*   **Economic Rehabilitation:** Providing seed money or tools to start small businesses, ensuring they are not a burden on society.

**3. Psycho-Social Rehabilitation:**
*   **Counseling:** Restoring personal dignity and confidence.
*   **De-stigmatization:** Education of the family and community to accept the patient back into the social fold (social integration),.
*   **[[Preventive Rehabilitation]]**: Preventing "dehabilitation" (social drift/loss of status) by treating early so the patient never leaves their normal environment.

**Mnemonic for Rehabilitation Components:**
**"VIMP S"** (Like VIPs, patients are VIMPs)
*   **V** - **V**ocational (Jobs/Skills)
*   **I** - **I**ntegrated (Social acceptance)
*   **M** - **M**edical (Surgery/MCR chappals)
*   **P** - **P**sychological (Counseling)
*   **S** - **S**ocial (Community support)
