# [[Ocular Injuries]] > Thermal and Radiation Injuries

### Thermal Injuries

**Etiology**
Thermal injuries to the eye are usually caused by direct contact with flame, hot fluids, or hot gases.

**Pathology and Clinical Features**
*   **Lids:** The main brunt of thermal injuries is usually borne by the [[eyelids]] due to the reflex closure of the eyes.
    *   Burns can range from mild erythema to severe necrosis.
    *   **Complications:** Severe burns can lead to scarring, [[cicatricial ectropion]], [[trichiasis]], [[ankyloblepharon]], and [[lagophthalmos]].
*   **Conjunctiva and Cornea:** Involved in severe cases or when the eye remains open during the accident.
    *   **Cornea:** Can develop abrasions, coagulation of the epithelium, stromal edema, and necrosis.
    *   **Conjunctiva:** Chemosis, congestion, and ischemic necrosis. Healing may result in [[symblepharon]] (adhesion between palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva).

**Management**
1.  **Lids:** Treated on general surgical principles for skin burns (cleaning, antibiotic dressing). Surgical correction for ectropion/lagophthalmos may be required later.
2.  **Cornea:**
    *   **[[Atropine]]** (1%) eye ointment/drops to relieve ciliary spasm and prevent posterior synechiae.
    *   **Topical Antibiotics:** To prevent secondary bacterial infection.
    *   **[[Corticosteroids]]:** To reduce inflammation (used with caution).
    *   **Lubricants:** Artificial tears for surface healing.

### Electrical Injuries

**Etiology**
Caused by the passage of a strong electric current through the body (e.g., live wire contact, lightning strike).

**Ocular Manifestations**
Lesions vary depending on the intensity and path of the current:
*   **Conjunctiva:** Congestion and chemosis.
*   **Cornea:** Punctate or diffuse interstitial opacities.
*   **Uvea:** Inflammation of the iris and ciliary body ([[iridocyclitis]]).
*   **Lens:** Development of **[[electric cataract]]**.
    *   *Onset:* Usually 2–4 months after the shock.
    *   *Morphology:* Starts as punctate subcapsular opacities (anterior or posterior) which mature rapidly. May appear as snowflake-like opacities.
*   **Retina:** Multiple hemorrhages, edema, and rarely [[retinal detachment]].
*   **Optic Nerve:** [[Optic neuritis]] or atrophy.

### Radiation Injuries

Ocular damage depends on the wavelength of the radiation and the energy absorbed.

#### 1. Ultraviolet (UV) Radiation Injuries
**Source:**
*   Short circuit bright lights.
*   Naked arc light (Industrial welding/Cinema operators).
*   Reflected sunlight from snow (**[[Snow blindness]]**).
*   UV lamps.

**Pathogenesis:**
*   UV rays (specifically 290–311 nm) are absorbed by the [[cornea]].
*   There is a **Latent Period** of 4–6 hours between exposure and symptom onset.
*   Causes desquamation of corneal epithelium (multiple epithelial erosions) known as **[[Photophthalmia]]**.

**Clinical Features:**
*   **Symptoms:** Extreme burning pain, profuse [[lacrimation]], severe [[photophobia]], and [[blepharospasm]].
*   **Signs:** Swelling of lids, conjunctival hyperemia, and multiple fluorescein-positive punctate epithelial erosions on the cornea.

**Management:**
*   **Prophylaxis:** Use of [[Crookes glass]] or protective goggles that absorb UV rays.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Cold compresses.
    *   Pad and bandage for 24 hours (promotes epithelial regeneration).
    *   Antibiotic ointment.
    *   Oral analgesics/sedatives for pain.

#### 2. Infrared (IR) Radiation Injuries
**Source:**
*   Glass manufacturing (Glass-blowing).
*   Iron/Steel furnaces (Chain-making, Tin-plate milling).
*   Looking at a solar eclipse (Solar retinopathy).

**Clinical Entities:**
*   **[[Glassblower’s Cataract]] (Heat Cataract):**
    *   *Mechanism:* IR rays are absorbed by the pigment of the [[iris]] and [[ciliary body]], affecting lens metabolism indirectly.
    *   *Morphology:* True **exfoliation** of the anterior lens capsule (lamella peels off and curls in the pupillary area) and **posterior cortical opacity** (discoid shape).
*   **[[Solar Retinopathy]] (Eclipse Burn):**
    *   *Mechanism:* Photochemical injury (blue light) combined with thermal injury from IR rays focused on the [[macula]].
    *   *Features:* Persistence of after-image, positive [[scotoma]], [[metamorphopsia]].
    *   *Fundus:* Initially a yellow spot at the fovea, later developing into a pigmented spot with a yellowish-white center (burnt-out hole in pigment epithelium). > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Fundus view showing macular burn/hole.

#### 3. Ionizing Radiation Injuries
**Source:**
*   Radiotherapy for tumors near the eye/orbit/nasopharynx (X-rays, Gamma rays, Neutrons).

**Ocular Lesions:**
*   **Lids:** [[Radiation dermatitis]], loss of lashes ([[madarosis]]), keratinization.
*   **Conjunctiva:** Radiation keratoconjunctivitis, dry eye (damage to lacrimal gland/goblet cells).
*   **Lens:** **[[Radiation Cataract]]**.
    *   *Latent period:* 6 months to a few years.
    *   *Pathology:* Direct damage to dividing cells and developing fibers.
    *   *Morphology:* Initially posterior subcapsular opacities (similar to heat cataract) progressing to total cortical cataract.
*   **Retina:** **[[Radiation Retinopathy]]**.
    *   Manifests as microaneurysms, hemorrhages, hard exudates, cotton wool spots, and neovascularization (similar to diabetic retinopathy).
*   **Optic Nerve:** **[[Radiation Optic Neuropathy]]**.
    *   Delayed effect (1–5 years post-therapy). Causes acute or gradual severe visual loss due to radionecrosis of the anterior visual pathways.

### Summary Table: Radiation Effects on the Eye

| Radiation Type | Wavelength | Main Site of Damage | Clinical Entity | Latent Period |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ultraviolet (UV)** | 290–311 nm | Cornea | [[Photophthalmia]] / [[Snow blindness]] | 4–6 Hours |
| **Infrared (IR)** | > 700 nm | Lens, Retina | [[Glassblower’s cataract]], [[Solar retinopathy]] | Years (Cataract), Immediate (Retina) |
| **Ionizing** | Very Short | Lens, Retina, Optic Nerve | [[Radiation cataract]], [[Radiation retinopathy]], Optic Neuropathy | Months to Years |

### Clinical Implications
*   **Occupational History:** Always ask about occupation (welder, glassblower) or hobbies (watching eclipse, skiing) in patients presenting with corneal pain or specific cataract types.
*   **Prophylaxis:** Prevention is the only effective cure for radiation injuries. Use of appropriate filters (e.g., UV filters for snow/welding, IR filters for furnaces) is mandatory.
*   **Cataract Surgery:** Patients with [[Glassblower's cataract]] often have a fragile anterior capsule due to true exfoliation; extra care is needed during [[capsulorhexis]].
