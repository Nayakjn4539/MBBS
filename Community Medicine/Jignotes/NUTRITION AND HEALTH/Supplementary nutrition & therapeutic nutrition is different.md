# [[NUTRITION AND HEALTH]] > Supplementary nutrition & therapeutic nutrition is different

### Difference Between Supplementary Nutrition & Therapeutic Nutrition

Although both concepts aim to improve nutritional status, they differ significantly in their objectives, target populations, and composition.

| Parameter | [[Supplementary Nutrition]] | [[Therapeutic Nutrition]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Objective** | To bridge the gap between the recommended dietary intake and the actual average intake to **prevent** malnutrition. | To **treat** and rehabilitate manifested severe malnutrition or specific disease states. |
| **Nature of Intervention** | **Preventive & Promotive**. It is a supplement, *not* a substitute for the home diet. | **Curative & Rehabilitative**. It is often the sole source of nutrition during the stabilization phase. |
| **Target Group** | Vulnerable groups: Children (6m–6y), Pregnant & Lactating women, Adolescent girls. (Mild to Moderate Malnutrition). | Patients with specific pathology: [[Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM)]], metabolic disorders (Diabetes), renal failure, etc. |
| **Setting** | Community-based: [[Anganwadi Centres (AWCs)]], Schools. | Facility-based: [[Nutritional Rehabilitation Centres (NRCs)]], Hospitals. |
| **Composition** | Locally available foods, Take Home Rations (THR), Hot Cooked Meals. Standardized calories/protein. | Specialized formulas (e.g., [[F-75]], [[F-100]]), RUTF (Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food), or specific diet plans. |
| **Duration** | Long-term (e.g., 300 days a year in ICDS). | Short-term to Medium-term (until recovery/stabilization). |
| **Examples** | [[Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)]], [[Mid-Day Meal Programme]]. | Management of SAM in NRCs, Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT). |

### 1. Supplementary Nutrition
This is a public health strategy designed to supplement the regular diet of vulnerable groups who are at risk of malnutrition but have not yet developed severe pathological complications.

*   **Logic:** It attempts to fill the **"Food Gap"** (calorie and protein deficit) existing in poor communities.
*   **Key Program: [[Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)]]**
    *   **Beneficiaries:** Children < 6 years, Pregnant & Lactating Mothers, Adolescent Girls.
    *   **Norms (Revised):**
        *   **Children (6-72 months):** 500 kcal + 12–15 g protein.
        *   **Pregnant/Lactating Mothers:** 600 kcal + 18–20 g protein.
        *   **Severely Malnourished (Community management):** 800 kcal + 20–25 g protein.
*   **Key Program: [[Mid-Day Meal Scheme (MDMS)]]**
    *   **Objective:** Enhance school enrollment and retention while improving nutritional status.
    *   **Norms:** Should supply **1/3rd** of daily energy and **1/2** of daily protein requirements.

### 2. Therapeutic Nutrition
This acts as a "medicine" to treat specific nutritional disorders or diseases. It is highly calculated and strictly monitored.

*   **Primary Focus: [[Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM)]]**
    *   Children with SAM (Weight for Height < -3SD, visible wasting, or nutritional edema) require hospitalization or specialized care at **[[Nutritional Rehabilitation Centres (NRCs)]]**.
*   **Phases of Management:**
    1.  **Stabilization Phase:** Use of **[[F-75]]** (Starter Diet).
        *   Low protein (0.9g/100ml) and energy (75 kcal/100ml) to prevent metabolic overload.
        *   **Iron is withheld** in this phase.
    2.  **Transition & Rehabilitation Phase:** Use of **[[F-100]]** (Catch-up Diet).
        *   High energy (100 kcal/100ml) and protein (2.9g/100ml) to promote rapid weight gain.
*   **Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT):**
    *   Specific dietary modifications for diseases like **Diabetes** (Low Glycemic Index), **Hypertension** (DASH diet), or **Renal Failure** (Protein restriction).

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Triage for Malnutrition:**
    *   A child with **Yellow Zone** weight (Mild/Moderate Malnutrition) on the growth chart needs **Supplementary Nutrition** (Double ration at Anganwadi) and nutrition education for the mother.
    *   A child with **Red Zone** weight + Medical complications (e.g., Hypoglycemia, Hypothermia, Infection) or Edema requires **Therapeutic Nutrition** at an NRC.

### Mnemonic
**"S.T.O.P. Malnutrition"**

*   **S** - **S**upplementary fills the **Gap** (preventive).
*   **T** - **T**herapeutic treats the **Sick** (curative).
*   **O** - **O**utpatient (Anganwadi) for Supplementary.
*   **P** - **P**rofessional care (Hospital/NRC) for Therapeutic.
