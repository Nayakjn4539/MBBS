# Radiological Examination of the Spine: Structures, Lines, and Landmarks

A systematic approach to reading spinal radiographs is essential to identify trauma, degeneration, infection, and congenital anomalies. The examination is generally divided by anatomical region (Cervical, Thoracic, Lumbar) and by specific views (Anteroposterior, Lateral, Oblique, Open-mouth).

### 1. General Assessment Strategy (The "ABCS")

When interpreting a spinal X-ray, the following sequence should be maintained:
*   **A - Alignment:** Assessment of the smooth, continuous lines of the vertebral column (kyphosis, lordosis, scoliosis).
*   **B - Bone:** Integrity of the [[Vertebral Body]] and posterior elements (pedicles, laminae, spinous processes). Look for fractures, lytic lesions, or sclerosis.
*   **C - Cartilage (Joints):** Assessment of the [[Intervertebral Disc Space]] and [[Facet Joint]].
*   **S - Soft Tissues:** Paravertebral shadows, prevertebral soft tissue thickness (cervical), and psoas shadows (lumbar).

### 2. Cervical Spine: Specific Lines and Landmarks

In the lateral view of the [[Cervical Spine]], four continuous, parallel curvilinear lines must be identified to rule out subluxation or fracture. Disruption of these lines indicates instability.

**The Four Parallel Lines (Lateral View):**
1.  **Anterior Vertebral Line:** Traces the anterior margin of the vertebral bodies.
2.  **Posterior Vertebral Line:** Traces the posterior margin of the vertebral bodies (anterior limit of the spinal canal).
3.  **Spinolaminar Line:** Formed by the junction of the laminae and spinous processes (posterior limit of the spinal canal).
4.  **Spinous Process Line:** Connects the tips of the [[Spinous Process]] from C2 to C7.

**Other Cervical Landmarks:**
*   **Prevertebral Soft Tissue Shadow:**
    *   Measured anterior to the vertebral bodies.
    *   **Upper Cervical (C2-C3):** Should be < 5 mm (Retropharyngeal space).
    *   **Lower Cervical (C6-C7):** Should be < 22 mm or less than the width of a vertebral body (Retrotracheal space).
    *   **Clinical Implication:** Widening suggests a [[Prevertebral Haematoma]] (trauma) or [[Retropharyngeal Abscess]] (infection/TB).
*   **Odontoid Process (Dens):** Best seen in the **Open Mouth View**. Inspect for symmetry of the lateral masses of C1 relative to the dens.

### 3. Thoracic and Lumbar Spine: Structures and Landmarks

**Anteroposterior (AP) View Features:**
*   **Vertebral Body Alignment:** The lateral margins should form a smooth line.
*   **Pedicles:** Appear as "oval footprints" or "eyes" located symmetrically near the superior lateral margins of the vertebral body.
    *   **Clinical Implication:** Loss of a pedicle outline is known as the **Winking Owl Sign**, indicative of [[Metastatic Bone Disease]] or [[Tuberculosis]] destroying the bone.
*   **Spinous Processes:** Appear as teardrop shapes in the midline. Deviation suggests rotation (as seen in [[Scoliosis]]).
*   **Interpedicular Distance:** The distance between the pedicles. Widening may suggest a burst fracture or an intraspinal tumor.
*   **Psoas Shadow:** The lateral outline of the psoas muscle. Loss of this shadow may indicate a [[Psoas Abscess]] or retroperitoneal hematoma.

**Lateral View Features:**
*   **Vertebral Height:** Compare anterior and posterior heights. Loss of anterior height suggests a **Wedge Compression Fracture**.
*   **Disc Space:** Should be uniform. Narrowing indicates [[Intervertebral Disc Degeneration]] or [[Spinal Tuberculosis]] (paradiscal lesion).
*   **Intervertebral Foramina:** Seen best in lateral (lumbar) or oblique (cervical) views; evaluated for stenosis.

### 4. Important Radiological Signs and Markers

#### A. Spondylolysis and Spondylolisthesis
Visualized best on the **Oblique View** of the Lumbar spine. The posterior elements form the appearance of a **"Scottish Terrier"** or **"Scottie Dog"**.

**Table: The Scottie Dog Anatomy**
| Dog Part | Anatomical Structure | Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nose** | [[Transverse Process]] | - |
| **Eye** | [[Pedicle]] | - |
| **Ear** | Superior Articular Facet | - |
| **Foreleg** | Inferior Articular Facet | - |
| **Neck** | [[Pars Interarticularis]] | A "collar" or break in the neck indicates **Spondylolysis** (Stress fracture). |
| **Body** | Lamina | - |

**Additional Signs in Spondylolisthesis:**
*   **Step Sign:** A palpable or radiographic "step" deformity felt/seen at the lumbosacral region due to forward slip.
*   **Inverted Napoleon Hat Sign:** Seen on AP view in severe **Spondyloptosis** (Grade V slip), where the L5 vertebra slips completely over the sacrum.

#### B. Scoliosis Markers
*   **Cobb’s Angle:** Used to measure the degree of curvature. Lines are drawn along the superior endplate of the upper end vertebra and the inferior endplate of the lower end vertebra. Perpendicular lines are drawn from these, and their intersection angle is measured.
*   **Risser’s Sign:** Grading of skeletal maturity based on the ossification of the [[Iliac Apophysis]].
*   **Rib Angle of Mehta:** Used to distinguish progressive from resolving infantile scoliosis.

#### C. Ankylosing Spondylitis Markers
*   **Bamboo Spine:** Squaring of vertebral bodies and formation of marginal [[Syndesmophytes]] (calcification of the annulus fibrosus bridging vertebrae).
*   **Dagger Sign:** A single central dense line on AP view due to ossification of the supraspinous and interspinous ligaments.
*   **Trolley Track Sign:** Three dense vertical lines on AP view (ossification of supraspinous/interspinous ligaments + capsular ligaments of facet joints).

#### D. Tuberculosis (Pott's Spine) Markers
*   **Bird’s Nest Abscess:** Fusiform paravertebral soft tissue shadow seen in thoracic TB.
*   **Aneurysmal Sign:** Scalloping/erosion of the anterior aspect of the vertebral body due to an abscess (mimics aortic aneurysm erosion).
*   **Concertina Collapse:** Total collapse of the vertebral body.

### 5. Trauma-Specific Findings

**Thoracolumbar Injuries:**
*   **Burst Fracture:** Comminution of the vertebral body with retropulsion of fragments into the spinal canal. Widening of interpedicular distance is a key X-ray sign.
*   **Chance Fracture (Seatbelt Injury):** Horizontal splitting of the vertebra (body, pedicles, and laminae) due to flexion-distraction forces.
*   **Compression Fracture:** Anterior wedging of the vertebral body; the posterior height remains normal.

**Cervical Injuries:**
*   **Jefferson’s Fracture:** Burst fracture of the [[Atlas]] (C1). Seen on **Open Mouth View** as lateral spreading of the lateral masses of C1 relative to C2.
*   **Hangman’s Fracture:** Fracture of the pars interarticularis (pedicles) of [[Axis]] (C2) with traumatic spondylolisthesis of C2 over C3.
*   **Clay Shoveler’s Fracture:** Avulsion fracture of the spinous process of C7 or T1.
*   **Teardrop Fracture:** A small triangular fragment separated from the antero-inferior corner of the vertebral body (indicates highly unstable flexion injury).

### 6. Denis Three-Column Concept (Functional Anatomy on X-ray)

Though a theoretical concept, these structures must be identified on X-ray to determine stability.

1.  **Anterior Column:** Anterior Longitudinal Ligament (ALL) + Anterior 2/3rds of the vertebral body and annulus.
2.  **Middle Column:** Posterior 1/3rd of the vertebral body + Posterior Longitudinal Ligament (PLL). *Injury here implies instability.*
3.  **Posterior Column:** Posterior arch (pedicles, laminae, facets) + Posterior ligamentous complex (supraspinous, interspinous ligaments, ligamentum flavum).

**Clinical Implication:** Injury to **two or more columns** generally indicates an **unstable spine** requiring surgical stabilization.
