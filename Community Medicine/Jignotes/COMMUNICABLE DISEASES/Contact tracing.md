# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Contact tracing

# Contact Tracing

**Contact tracing** is a fundamental public health measure used to control the spread of [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]]. It involves the identification, listing, and follow-up of persons who may have been exposed to an infected person (the [[index case]]).

### **Definition**
It is the technique by which the persons (contacts) who have been exposed to a diagnosed patient are **identified**, **located**, **investigated**, and **treated**.

### **Objectives**
1.  **Interrupt Transmission:** To break the [[chain of transmission]] by isolating or treating potential carriers before they infect others.
2.  **Early Detection:** To identify mild, missed, or subclinical cases.
3.  **Prevention:** To provide specific protection (e.g., [[chemoprophylaxis]] or immunization) to susceptible individuals.

### **Key Epidemiological Tools**
*   **[[Incubation Period]]:** Knowledge of the incubation period is crucial for tracing the source of infection and identifying contacts. It helps determine the timeframe for surveillance or [[quarantine]].
*   **[[Secondary Attack Rate]] (SAR):** This measures the communicability of the disease. It is the number of exposed persons developing the disease within the range of the incubation period following exposure to the primary case.

### **Steps in Contact Tracing**

1.  **Identification:** Identify the [[index case]] (the first case that comes to the notice of the investigator).
2.  **Listing Contacts:** List all persons who had contact with the index case during the [[period of communicability]].
3.  **Screening/Testing:** Investigate contacts for signs of infection (clinical or laboratory).
4.  **Management:** Apply control measures:
    *   **[[Quarantine]]:** Restriction of activities of healthy contacts for the maximum incubation period.
    *   **[[Isolation]]:** Separation of infected persons.
    *   **[[Chemoprophylaxis]]:** Administration of drugs to prevent infection.
    *   **Immunization:** Vaccination of susceptible contacts (e.g., Ring immunization in Smallpox/Measles).

### **Disease-Specific Applications**

#### **1. Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)**
Contact tracing is one of the **best methods** for controlling the spread of STDs/[[HIV]].
*   **Process:** Patients are interviewed to identify sexual partners. The key to success is the patient themselves, who must disclose contacts voluntarily.
*   **[[Cluster Testing]]:** Patients are asked to name other persons of either sex who move in the same socio-sexual environment. These persons are then screened. This technique almost doubles the number of cases found.
*   **[[Epidemiological Treatment]]:** Administration of full therapeutic dose of treatment to persons recently exposed (contacts), while awaiting laboratory results.

#### **2. Tuberculosis (TB)**
*   **Active Case Finding:** Screening of household contacts, especially children < 6 years and those with comorbidities (e.g., [[HIV]]).
*   **[[Chemoprophylaxis]]:** Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) is given to asymptomatic household contacts (especially children < 6 years) to prevent disease progression.
*   **Reverse Contact Tracing:** In pediatric TB, looking for the adult source in the household.

#### **3. Leprosy**
*   **Contact Survey:** In areas with low prevalence (<1 per 1000), examination of all household contacts is the technique of choice.
*   **Surveillance:** Contacts are kept under surveillance to detect early signs (e.g., skin patches, nerve thickening).

#### **4. COVID-19**
*   **Technology:** Use of location-based surveillance apps (e.g., **[[Aarogya Setu]]**) to track contacts using Bluetooth and location data.
*   **Testing:** Testing for TB linked to COVID-19 contact tracing (Bi-directional screening).

#### **5. Other Communicable Diseases**
*   **Meningococcal Meningitis:** Chemoprophylaxis (e.g., Rifampicin, Ciprofloxacin) for close contacts.
*   **Poliomyelitis:** In an outbreak, a house-to-house active search is conducted in the community where an [[AFP]] case resides.
*   **Smallpox (Historical):** "Surveillance and Containment" strategy relied heavily on tracing contacts and isolating them/vaccinating them.

### **Mnemonics**

**"TRACE"** to remember the steps:
*   **T** - **T**rack the Index Case.
*   **R** - **R**ecord all contacts (Listing).
*   **A** - **A**ssess for symptoms/infection (Screening).
*   **C** - **C**ontain (Quarantine/Isolate).
*   **E** - **E**liminate risk (Treatment/Prophylaxis).

### **Clinical Relevance**
*   **Breaking the Chain:** Without contact tracing, treating only the patient who presents to the clinic ("Tip of the Iceberg") leaves the [[reservoir of infection]] active in the community.
*   **Legal Aspect:** For certain notifiable diseases, failure to assist in contact tracing or concealment of disease status can have legal implications under public health acts.
*   **[[Herd Immunity]]:** By identifying and vaccinating contacts (Ring Immunization), a buffer of immune individuals is created, protecting the wider community.
