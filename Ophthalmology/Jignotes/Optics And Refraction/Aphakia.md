# Aphakia

### Definition
**Aphakia** literally means the absence of the [[crystalline lens]] from the eye. From an optical standpoint, it is defined as a condition where the lens is absent from the pupillary area and does not participate in refraction [], [], [], [].

### Etiology
Aphakia can be classified based on its cause:
*   **Congenital:** Rare condition; congenital absence of the lens [], [].
*   **Surgical:** The most common cause, occurring after the removal of the lens (e.g., [[cataract surgery]]) [], [].
*   **Traumatic:**
    *   Extrusion of the lens from the eye due to trauma [].
    *   Absorption of lens matter following trauma (rare, seen in children) [].
    *   **Posterior dislocation:** Displacement of the lens into the [[vitreous]], causing optical aphakia [], [].

### Optics of Aphakia
Removal of the crystalline lens causes drastic optical changes in the eye:
*   **High Hypermetropia:** The eye becomes highly hypermetropic [], [].
*   **Reduced Power:** The total dioptric power of the eye reduces from approximately **+60D to +44D** [], [], [].
*   **Focal Points Change:**
    *   **Anterior focal distance:** Increases to **23.2 mm** (Normal: 15.7 mm) [], [].
    *   **Posterior focal distance:** Increases to **31 mm** (Normal: 24 mm), meaning the focus point is about 7 mm behind the eyeball [], [].
*   **Loss of Accommodation:** There is total loss of [[accommodation]] [], [], [].
*   **Nodal Point Shift:** There is an anterior shift of the nodal point and principal focus [].

### Clinical Features

#### Symptoms
*   **Defective Vision:** Marked loss of vision for both far and near due to high [[hypermetropia]] and loss of accommodation [], [].
    *   *Clinical Implication:* In preoperative emmetropia, the patient becomes hypermetropic by about **+10D to +11D** [].
*   **Erythropsia and Cyanopsia:** Patients may complain of seeing red and blue images due to excessive entry of ultraviolet and infrared rays in the absence of the crystalline lens [], [].

#### Signs
*   **Limbus:** A limbal or corneal scar may be visible in surgical aphakia [], [].
*   **Anterior Chamber:** It is deeper than normal [], [].
*   **Iris:**
    *   **[[Iridodonesis]]:** Tremulousness of the iris due to lack of posterior support from the lens [], [].
    *   The iris moves posteriorly [].
*   **Pupil:** Jet black in color [], [].
*   **[[Purkinje Images]]:** Only two images (1st and 2nd) are visible. The 3rd and 4th images (formed by the lens) are absent [], [].
*   **Fundus:** Examination shows a small, hypermetropic [[optic disc]] [], [].
*   **Retinoscopy:** Reveals high hypermetropia [], [].

### Treatment and Optical Correction
The principle is to correct the high refractive error using convex lenses to focus images onto the [[retina]].

#### 1. Spectacles
Historically the most common method, but usage has decreased.
*   **Power:** Roughly **+10D spherical** with cylindrical lenses for surgically induced [[astigmatism]] (for distance). An addition of **+3D to +4D** is required for near vision [].
*   **Advantages:** Cheap, easy, and safe method [].
*   **Disadvantages of Aphakic Glasses:**
    1.  **Image Magnification:** The retinal image is magnified by **25–30%**. This makes fusion difficult if the other eye is phakic (unilateral aphakia), leading to [[diplopia]] [], [].
    2.  **Roving Ring Scotoma ("Jack-in-the-box" phenomenon):** A scotoma produced by the prismatic effect at the lens edge. Objects may suddenly appear and disappear from the field of vision as the eye moves [], [], [].
    3.  **Spherical Aberrations (Pin-cushion distortion):** Straight lines appear curved (parabolas), causing distortion [], [].
    4.  **Limited Field of Vision:** Peripheral vision is poor [].
    5.  **Prismatic Errors:** Resulting from displaced optical centers [].
    6.  **Physical Inconvenience:** Lenses are heavy and cosmetically unappealing ("Cosmetic blemish") [], [].

#### 2. Contact Lenses
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Less magnification (**approx. 5%**) compared to spectacles [], [].
    *   Elimination of aberrations and prismatic effects [].
    *   Wider and better field of vision [].
    *   Suitable for unilateral aphakia (better [[binocular vision]]) [].
    *   Cosmetically acceptable [].
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   Costly and cumbersome to wear/handle, especially for the elderly or children [], [], [].
    *   Risk of corneal complications [].

#### 3. Intraocular Lens (IOL) Implantation
This is the **treatment of choice** and best method for optical rehabilitation [], [].
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Produces minimal magnification (**1–2%**) [].
    *   Minimal [[aniseikonia]] (difference in image size between eyes) [].
    *   Rapid return of binocularity and normal peripheral vision [].
    *   Eliminates handling problems seen with contact lenses [].
*   **Types:**
    *   Posterior Chamber IOL (PC-IOL): Most physiological; placed in the capsular bag [].
    *   Anterior Chamber IOL (AC-IOL).
    *   Iris-supported lenses (e.g., Iris claw) [].
*   **Secondary IOL:** Can be implanted in patients who are already aphakic [].

#### 4. Refractive Corneal Surgery
*   Used if secondary IOL cannot be implanted.
*   Techniques include **Hyperopic [[LASIK]]**, **Keratophakia**, and **Epikeratophakia** (under trial/historical) [], [].

### Pseudophakia
**Pseudophakia** is the condition where the natural lens is replaced by an artificial **[[Intraocular Lens]] (IOL)** [], [].
*   **Refractive Status:**
    *   **Emmetropia:** If IOL power is exact (Ideal). Requires glasses only for near vision [].
    *   **Consecutive Myopia:** If IOL overcorrects. Requires concave lenses for distance [].
    *   **Consecutive Hypermetropia:** If IOL undercorrects. Requires convex lenses for distance [].
*   **Signs:**
    *   Surgical limbal scar [].
    *   Anterior chamber slightly deeper than normal [].
    *   Mild iridodonesis may be present [].
    *   **Purkinje Images:** All **four** images are seen (Images 3 and 4 come from the IOL surfaces) [], [].
    *   Pupil is black but shows shining reflexes from the IOL [].
