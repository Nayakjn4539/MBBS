# [[Mechanical Injuries]] > Contusions and its age changes

### Definition
A **[[Contusion]]** (or bruise) is an effusion of blood into the tissues due to the rupture of blood vessels (venules, arterioles, capillaries) caused by the application of [[blunt force trauma]]. 
*   The clinical sign is known as **Ecchymosis**.
*   The surface of the skin usually remains intact.

### Mechanism of Production
1.  **Impact:** Application of blunt force (blow, squeeze, pinch) compresses the tissues.
2.  **Rupture:** Traction forces cause rupture of subcutaneous blood vessels.
3.  **Extravasation:** Blood leaks out into the connective tissue planes.
4.  **Infiltration:** Blood infiltrates the tissues, causing swelling and discoloration.

### Factors Modifying Contusions
The size and appearance of a bruise do not always correspond to the force applied. Factors include:

1.  **Site of Injury:**
    *   **Vascularity:** Vascular parts (face, vulva, scrotum) bruise easily.
    *   **Underlying Structure:** Tissues over bones (e.g., shin) bruise easily compared to abdomen/buttocks.
    *   **Laxity:** Loose tissues (eyelids/scrotum) allow blood to spread easily (Spectacle hematoma).
2.  **Age:** Children and elderly bruise easily due to delicate skin or loss of supportive subcutaneous fat/elastic tissue.
3.  **Sex:** Females bruise more easily than males (more subcutaneous fat).
4.  **Color of Skin:** Bruises are more visible in fair-skinned individuals. In dark skin, they may only be felt as tender swellings.
5.  **Constitution/Disease:** Bleeding diathesis (Haemophilia, Leukemia, Scurvy, Vitamin K deficiency) causes massive bruising with trivial trauma.
6.  **Gravity:** Blood may trickle downwards through fascial planes to appear at a site distant from the impact (**[[Ectopic Bruise]]**).

### Classification of Contusions

#### 1. Superficial Contusion
Located in the subcutaneous tissue. Visible immediately or shortly after injury.

#### 2. Deep Contusion
Located in deep muscles or organs. May take hours or days to appear on the surface (delayed bruising) or may never appear externally. Requires incision during autopsy to detect.

#### 3. Patterned Contusions
The shape of the bruise suggests the weapon used.
*   **Tram-line / Railway-line Bruise:** Two parallel lines of bruising with a central pale area. Caused by a rod, stick, or cane.
    *   *Mechanism:* The weapon sinks into the skin, pushing blood from the center to the sides, rupturing marginal vessels.
*   **Six-penny / Discoid Bruise:** Round or oval bruises, typically 1–2 cm. Caused by finger-tip pressure (seen in [[Throttling]]).
*   **Doughnut Bruise:** Ring-shaped bruise produced by a spherical object (e.g., cricket ball).
*   **Imprint Bruise:** Reproduces the pattern of the object (e.g., tire tread marks, radiator grill, shoe sole).

#### 4. Ectopic / Migratory / Percolated Contusion
Bruise appearing at a site away from the point of impact due to gravity.
*   **Black Eye (Spectacle Hematoma):** Injury to the forehead causing blood to settle in the eyelids.
*   **Battle's Sign:** Bruising over the mastoid process due to fracture of the posterior cranial fossa (middle ear bleeding).
*   **Jumpers Fracture:** Bruise in the thigh/knee appearing days after a hip fracture.

### Ageing of Contusions (Color Changes)
This is the most important medicolegal aspect for dating injuries. The color changes occur due to the breakdown of [[Hemoglobin]].

| Time Since Injury | Color of Bruise | Pigment/Chemistry |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fresh** | **Red** | **Oxyhemoglobin** |
| **Few hours – 3 days** | **Blue / Purple / Black** | **Deoxyhemoglobin** (Reduced Hb) |
| **4 – 5 days** | **Brown** | **[[Hemosiderin]]** |
| **5 – 7 days** | **Green** | **[[Hematoidin]]** / Biliverdin |
| **7 – 10 days** | **Yellow** | **[[Bilirubin]]** |
| **> 2 weeks** | **Normal Skin** | Complete absorption |

> **Mnemonic for Ageing:** **VIBGYOR** (reverse order roughly) or **"Red Blue Green Yellow"**
> *   **R**ed (Day 1)
> *   **B**lue (Day 2-3)
> *   **G**reen (Day 5-7)
> *   **Y**ellow (Day 7-10)

*Note:*
*   **Subconjunctival Hemorrhage:** Does **NOT** undergo color changes because the thin conjunctiva allows oxygen to permeate, keeping the hemoglobin red (oxygenated) until absorption. It initially appears red and eventually turns yellow before disappearing.
*   Timing varies based on the size of the bruise and the health of the individual.

### Medicolegal Importance
1.  **Evidence of Trauma:** Indicates the application of blunt force.
2.  **Nature of Weapon:** Patterned bruises (e.g., tram-line, belt buckle) can identify the weapon.
3.  **Age of Injury:** Color changes help determine the time of assault.
4.  **Degree of Violence:** Extensive bruising suggests severe force/struggle.
5.  **Character of Injury:**
    *   **Homicide:** Throttling marks on neck, defense wounds on arms.
    *   **Suicide:** Rare to have extensive bruising.
    *   **Accident:** E.g., run-over injuries.
6.  **Reconstruction:** Distribution of bruises helps reconstruct the scene of crime (e.g., restraining marks).

### Differential Diagnosis

#### 1. True Bruise vs. Artificial (Fabricated) Bruise
Artificial bruises are created using irritants (Calotropis, Marking nut) to support false charges.

| Feature | True Bruise | Artificial Bruise |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Site** | Any part, often inaccessible | Accessible parts (arms, legs) |
| **Shape** | Round, irregular | Irregular, bizarre shapes |
| **Color** | Multiple colors (ageing) | Uniform dark brown |
| **Margins** | Diffuse | Sharp, well-defined |
| **Surface** | Intact epidermis | Vesicles/blisters present |
| **Itching** | Absent | Intense itching |
| **Chemical Analysis** | Negative | Positive for irritant plants |

#### 2. Antemortem Bruise vs. Postmortem Lividity (Hypostasis)
This is a critical distinction in autopsy.

| Feature | Antemortem Bruise | Postmortem Lividity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cause** | Blunt trauma (Rupture of vessels) | Gravity (Settling of blood) |
| **Site** | Anywhere (site of impact) | Dependent parts of body |
| **Swelling** | Often raised/swollen | Not raised |
| **Cut Section** | **Extravasated blood** in tissues | Blood inside vessels (engorged) |
| **Washing** | **Cannot be washed away** | Can be washed away |
| **Color Changes** | Present (Ageing) | Absent (Constant) |
| **Enzyme Reaction** | Positive | Negative |

#### 3. Antemortem Bruise vs. Postmortem Bruise
Bruises can be produced after death if severe force is applied within 1-2 hours (molecular life).

| Feature | Antemortem Bruise | Postmortem Bruise |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Swelling** | Present | Absent |
| **Color Change** | Present | Absent |
| **Coagulation** | Coagulated blood | Fluid blood |
| **Histology** | Vital reaction (infiltration) | No vital reaction |
| **Enzyme Levels** | Increased (Serotonin/Histamine) | No increase |

### Autopsy Findings
*   **External:** Swelling, discoloration. Photography is essential.
*   **Internal:** On incision, dark red coagulated blood is found infiltrated into the tissues.
*   **Procedure:** If bruising is doubtful, make a small incision. If blood does not wash away with water, it is a bruise.
*   **Concealed Bruises:** Dissection of muscles (e.g., neck strap muscles in strangulation) is necessary to reveal deep bruises not visible externally.
