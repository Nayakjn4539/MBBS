# Manual Small Incision Cataract Surgery (SICS) Instrumentation

[[Manual Small Incision Cataract Surgery]] (SICS) is a widely practiced technique, particularly in developing countries, offering the advantages of being sutureless and cost-effective compared to [[Phacoemulsification]]. The procedure relies on specific instruments to create a self-sealing tunnel and manage the nucleus manually.

### 1. Preparation and Exposure Instruments

#### **Eye Speculums**
These are used to retract the eyelids and keep the palpebral aperture open during surgery.
*   **Universal Metallic Eye Speculum:** Can be used for either the right or left eye. It features two limbs with a spring mechanism and a screw to adjust the width. The blades are open (fenestrated).
*   **Eye Speculum with Guard:** Has solid blades to cover the eyelashes and keep them away from the surgical field.
*   **Wire Speculum (Barraquer):** Very light, causing minimal pressure on the globe.

**Clinical Implication:** Proper exposure is critical. The wire speculum is often preferred when minimizing pressure on the [[Eyeball]] is crucial to prevent vitreous upthrust.

#### **Superior Rectus Holding Forceps**
*   **Structure:** A toothed forceps (1 x 2 teeth) with a characteristic **S-shaped double curve** near the tip.
*   **Function:**
    *   Used to grasp the [[Superior Rectus Muscle]] belly to pass a **bridle suture**.
    *   This suture fixes the eye in **downward gaze**, which is essential for superior scleral tunnel construction in SICS,.

### 2. Incision and Tunnel Construction

#### **Blade Breaker (Razor Blade Fragment Holder)**
*   **Structure:** An instrument designed to hold a small fragment of a razor blade firmly. It has a locking device. Disposable versions with pre-mounted blades are also available.
*   **Use:** It is the most commonly used cutting device to make the initial partial-thickness **scleral groove** (external incision) in SICS, usually 1.5 to 2 mm behind the [[Limbus]],.

#### **Sclerocorneal Splitter / Crescent Knife**
*   **Structure:** A knife with a blunt tip and a bevel-up curved blade. It has cutting/splitting action at the tip and sides.
*   **Function:**
    *   Used to create the **sclerocorneal tunnel**.
    *   It dissects into the clear cornea (about 1–1.5 mm) to create the self-sealing valve effect,.

#### **Side-Port Blade (15° / MVR Blade)**
*   **15° Blade:** Fine straight knife with a sharp pointed tip. Used to make the **side-port entry** (paracentesis) at the 9 o'clock position,.
*   **MVR (Micro Vitreoretinal) / V-Lance Blade:** Similar to the 15° blade but with cutting edges on both sides (triangular). Used for side ports.

#### **Angular Keratome**
*   **Structure:** A diamond-shaped blade with a sharp apex and two cutting edges. Disposable versions are common.
*   **Function:**
    *   Used to make the **internal corneal incision** (entry into the [[Anterior Chamber]]) at the anterior limit of the scleral tunnel.
    *   Sizes vary (2.8 mm, 3.2 mm). Larger keratomes or extension keratomes are used to enlarge the internal incision to allow nucleus delivery in SICS.

### 3. Capsulotomy and Hydro-Procedures

#### **Capsulorhexis Forceps (Utrata)**
*   **Structure:** Very fine, delicate forceps with small curved tips (often with a cystotome-like tip).
*   **Function:** Used to perform **Continuous Curvilinear Capsulorhexis ([[CCC]])**. The forceps grasp the anterior capsule flap and tear it in a circular fashion. This creates a strong capsular opening resistant to tearing during nucleus manipulation,.

#### **Hydrodissection Cannula**
*   **Structure:** A single-bore cannula (25G, 27G, or 30G) with a flattened or beveled tip and a bend/angulation 10-12 mm from the end.
*   **Function:**
    *   **Hydrodissection:** Separating the [[Cortex]] from the [[Lens Capsule]].
    *   **Hydrodelineation:** Separating the nucleus from the epinucleus/cortex.
    *   Ideally attached to a syringe with fluid to inject beneath the anterior capsule rim.

### 4. Nucleus Delivery and Cortical Cleanup

#### **Irrigating Vectis (Wire Vectis)**
*   **Structure:** A modified vectis loop made of thick hollow wire. The anterior end has small openings (0.3 mm) for fluid egress. The posterior end connects to a syringe or infusion set.
*   **Function:** This is the **primary instrument for nucleus delivery** in SICS. It utilizes **visco-expression** or hydro-expression. The loop is passed under the nucleus while fluid/viscoelastic forces the nucleus out through the tunnel,.

#### **Simcoe Cannula (Two-Way I/A Cannula)**
*   **Structure:** A double-barreled cannula. One hub connects to an infusion line (IV bottle) for maintaining the chamber depth, and the other connects to a syringe/tubing for aspiration.
*   **Function:** Used for **manual irrigation and aspiration** of the residual cortical lens matter after nucleus delivery,.

### 5. IOL Implantation and Wound Closure

#### **Intraocular Lens (IOL) Dialer / Sinskey Hook**
*   **Structure:** A fine, stout instrument with a bent tip.
*   **Function:**
    *   Engages the dialing holes of a **rigid [[PMMA]] IOL** to position it correctly within the capsular bag.
    *   Can also be used for nucleus manipulation (rotation) during earlier steps.

#### **Iris Repositor**
*   **Structure:** A delicate, flat, malleable blade with blunt edges.
*   **Function:**
    *   To reposit the [[Iris]] back into the anterior chamber if it prolapses.
    *   To check the integrity of the tunnel and ensuring no iris tissue is caught in the wound.

#### **Colibri Forceps**
*   **Structure:** Forceps with very fine teeth (1x2) at the tip.
*   **Function:** Used to hold the corneal or scleral edge of the incision during suturing (if required) or stabilization.

#### **Needle Holder (Barraquer/Castroviejo/Silcock)**
*   **Structure:** Spring-action instruments with finely serrated jaws to hold delicate needles,.
*   **Function:** Used to pass sutures (typically 10-0 nylon) if the tunnel is not self-sealing or in pediatric cases. **Barraquer** (curved tip, spring action) and **Castroviejo** (locking mechanism) are common types,.

#### **Vannas’ Scissors**
*   **Structure:** Very fine, delicate scissors with small cutting blades kept apart by spring action.
*   **Function:**
    *   Cutting the anterior capsule (if can-opener technique is used).
    *   Performing **peripheral [[Iridectomy]]** (if required).
    *   Cutting 10-0 nylon sutures.
