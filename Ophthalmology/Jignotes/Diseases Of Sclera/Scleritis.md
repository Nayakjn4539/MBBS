# [[Diseases Of Sclera]] > Scleritis

# Scleritis

**Scleritis** refers to the granulomatous inflammation of the [[sclera]] proper. It is a much more serious disease than episcleritis, capable of causing visual impairment and even loss of the eye if treated inadequately. It typically occurs in elderly patients (40–70 years), affecting females more frequently than males.

## Classification
The classification is based on the anatomical site and the nature of the inflammation (Watson and Hayreh Classification).

> Classification flowchart of Scleritis branching into Anterior (98%) and Posterior (2%). Anterior divides into Non-necrotizing (Diffuse/Nodular) and Necrotizing (With inflammation/Without inflammation)

### 1. Anterior Scleritis (98%)
*   **Non-necrotizing (85%):**
    *   **Diffuse:** Widespread inflammation involving a quadrant or more.
    *   **Nodular:** One or more hard, purplish, elevated, immovable nodules.
*   **Necrotizing (13%):**
    *   **With Inflammation:** Vaso-occlusive, Granulomatous, or Surgically induced.
    *   **Without Inflammation:** Also known as [[Scleromalacia perforans]].

### 2. Posterior Scleritis (2%)
*   Inflammation involving the sclera behind the equator.

## Etiology and Associations
Approximately 50% of scleritis cases are associated with systemic diseases.

*   **Autoimmune/Connective Tissue Disorders:**
    *   [[Rheumatoid arthritis]] (Most common association; 0.5% of RA patients develop scleritis).
    *   [[Wegener's granulomatosis]] (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis).
    *   [[Polyarteritis nodosa]] (PAN).
    *   [[Systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE).
    *   [[Ankylosing spondylitis]].
    *   Relapsing Polychondritis.
*   **Infections:**
    *   [[Herpes zoster ophthalmicus]].
    *   Tuberculosis, Syphilis, Leprosy (Granulomatous diseases).
    *   Pseudomonas or fungal infections (often post-surgical).
*   **Metabolic:** Gout, Thyrotoxicosis.
*   **Surgically Induced Scleritis (SIS):** Rare complication following ocular surgeries like cataract extraction or retinal detachment surgery.

## Clinical Features

### Symptoms
*   **Pain:** The hallmark symptom. It is moderate to severe, deep, and **boring** in character. It often wakes the patient early in the morning and radiates to the jaw, temple, or forehead.
*   **Redness:** Can be localized or diffuse.
*   **Photophobia and Lacrimation:** Usually mild to moderate.
*   **Diminution of Vision:** May occur occasionally.

### Signs per Clinical Type

#### 1. Anterior Non-necrotizing Scleritis
*   **Diffuse:** Involved area is raised and has a **salmon pink to purple** color.
*   **Nodular:** Nodules are firm, tender, and **immovable** (cannot be moved separately from the sclera, unlike episcleral nodules).

#### 2. Anterior Necrotizing Scleritis
*   **With Inflammation:** Acute severe form. Intense localized inflammation with areas of infarction due to vasculitis. The sclera becomes transparent/ectatic, and the dark uveal tissue shines through.
*   **Without Inflammation ([[Scleromalacia perforans]]):**
    *   Typically seen in elderly women with long-standing seropositive [[Rheumatoid arthritis]].
    *   **Painless** and asymptomatic initially.
    *   Yellowish patch of melting sclera develops due to arterial obliteration.
    *   The sclera becomes dead white (sequestrum) and absorbs, leaving thin sclera with exposed uvea.
    *   Spontaneous perforation is rare unless IOP is elevated.

#### 3. Posterior Scleritis
Often misdiagnosed because the eye may look white anteriorly. Features result from inflammation of adjacent structures:
*   Exudative [[retinal detachment]].
*   [[Macular edema]].
*   Disc edema.
*   Proptosis or restricted ocular movements.
*   **Choroidal folds**.

## Complications
*   **Cornea:** [[Sclerosing keratitis]] (triangular opacity advancing from limbus), Keratolysis (melting), Peripheral corneal guttering.
*   **Uvea:** Anterior uveitis (common in necrotizing forms).
*   **Lens:** Complicated [[cataract]].
*   **Glaucoma:** Secondary glaucoma due to angle blockage, synechiae, or steroid therapy.
*   **Globe:** Staphyloma formation (ectasia of sclera).

---

## Investigations
A thorough workup is required to rule out systemic associations.

*   **Blood Tests:** Complete hemogram, ESR, C-reactive protein (CRP), Serum uric acid (Gout).
*   **Immunological Survey:** Rheumatoid factor (RF), Antinuclear antibody (ANA), Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), LE cells.
*   **Infectious Disease Screening:** VDRL/FTA-ABS (Syphilis), Mantoux test (TB).
*   **Imaging:**
    *   **B-scan Ultrasonography:** Essential for **Posterior Scleritis**. It typically shows the **"T" sign** (fluid in the sub-Tenon's space creating a T-shape with the optic nerve).
    *   CT/MRI to rule out orbital tumors or foreign bodies.

## Differential Diagnosis: Episcleritis vs. Scleritis

| Feature | [[Episcleritis]] | [[Scleritis]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pathology** | Inflammation of superficial episcleral tissue | Inflammation of sclera proper |
| **Color/Hue** | Bright red/Pinkish | Bluish-red/Violaceous/Purple |
| **Pain** | Mild discomfort/pricking | Severe, deep, boring pain |
| **Palpation** | Nodule may move over sclera | Nodule is immovable/fixed |
| **Phenylephrine Test** (2.5% or 10%) | **Blanching occurs** (Redness disappears) | **No Blanching** (Redness persists) |
| **Course** | Benign, self-limiting | Serious, potential visual loss |

### Clinical Implication
**Phenylephrine Test:** Instilling phenylephrine drops causes constriction of superficial episcleral vessels but not the deep vascular plexus of the sclera. Therefore, blanching indicates episcleritis, while persistence of redness indicates scleritis.

## Treatment

### 1. Non-Infectious Scleritis
*   **Non-necrotizing:**
    *   **Oral NSAIDs:** First line. Indomethacin (75 mg BD), Flurbiprofen (300 mg OD), or Ibuprofen.
    *   **Oral Steroids:** If NSAIDs fail. Prednisolone (1 mg/kg) tapered slowly.
*   **Necrotizing:**
    *   **Systemic Steroids:** High doses (oral or IV methylprednisolone pulse therapy) are often required immediately.
    *   **Immunosuppressive Agents:** Cyclophosphamide, Methotrexate, Azathioprine, or Cyclosporine. Used for steroid-resistant cases or steroid-sparing.
    *   **Biologics:** Infliximab or Rituximab in refractory cases.
*   **Surgical:** Scleral patch graft may be needed for extensive scleral melting or risk of perforation.

### 2. Infectious Scleritis
*   Aggressive antimicrobial therapy (topical and systemic) tailored to the organism.
*   Surgical debridement to debulk infected tissue.

> **WARNING:** **Subconjunctival steroid injections** are **CONTRAINDICATED** in scleritis as they may lead to scleral thinning and perforation.
