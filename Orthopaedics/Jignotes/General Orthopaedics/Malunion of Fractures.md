# [[General Orthopaedics]] > Malunion of Fractures

### Malunion of Fractures

**Definition**
[[Malunion]] is defined as the healing of a fracture in an anatomically abnormal position. It implies that the fracture has united (bony continuity is restored), but the alignment is unsatisfactory regarding angulation, rotation, or length.

### Etiology and Risk Factors
Malunion is frequently iatrogenic or due to neglect. Common causes include:
*   **Improper Reduction:** Failure to achieve adequate apposition and alignment during the initial treatment (closed or open).
*   **Inadequate Immobilization:** Failure to hold the fracture securely, allowing fragments to slip (re-displace) within the cast or splint before [[Callus]] formation is solid.
*   **Severe Comminution:** [[Comminuted fracture]]s are inherently unstable and difficult to reconstruct anatomically.
*   **Soft Tissue Interposition:** Muscle or periosteum trapped between fragments preventing proper alignment.
*   **Early Weight Bearing:** Loading the bone before sufficient consolidation.
*   **Treatment by Unqualified Practitioners:** Manipulation by traditional bonesetters often leads to gross deformities.
*   **Paediatric Growth Plate Injuries:** Damage to the [[Physis]] (Salter-Harris injuries) can cause asymmetrical growth arrest, leading to progressive malunion.

### Classification of Deformities
Malunion can present as a single deformity or a combination of the following components:
1.  **Angulation:** Varus or Valgus deformity; Recurvatum (hyperextension) or Antecurvatum (flexion).
2.  **Rotation:** Internal or external rotational deformity. This is often harder to detect on X-rays but clinically significant.
3.  **Shortening:** Due to overlap of fragments (riding) or crushing of bone substance.
4.  **Translation:** Horizontal displacement of the distal fragment (less clinically significant if alignment is maintained).

### Clinical Features
*   **Deformity:** Visible bowing, twisting, or abnormal shape of the limb.
*   **Shortening:** Limb length discrepancy, leading to a limp in lower limb fractures.
*   **Loss of Function:** Difficulty in performing daily activities (e.g., loss of pronation/supination in forearm malunion).
*   **Pain:** Often due to altered biomechanics strain on adjacent joints or developing [[Osteoarthritis]].
*   **Joint Stiffness:** Limitation of range of motion in adjacent joints.

### Common Sites and Specific Deformities
Certain fractures have a high propensity for specific malunions.

| Fracture Site | Characteristic Deformity/Malunion | Clinical Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Supracondylar Humerus** | [[Cubitus Varus]] (Gunstock Deformity) | Cosmetic deformity; risk of tardy [[Ulnar nerve]] palsy. |
| **Distal Radius ([[Colles' fracture]])** | Dinner Fork Deformity | Radial shortening, dorsal tilt; loss of grip strength and rotation. |
| **Intertrochanteric/Neck of Femur** | [[Coxa Vara]] | Shortening of limb, Trendelenburg gait. |
| **Tibia Shaft** | Varus/Valgus/Recurvatum | Cosmetic issues; high risk of ankle/knee osteoarthritis. |
| **Clavicle** | Shortening/Angulation | Usually cosmetic lump; functional disability is rare. |
| **Metacarpals** | Rotational Malalignment | Scissoring of fingers upon making a fist. |

### Diagnosis
1.  **Clinical Examination:**
    *   Look for visible deformity and scars.
    *   Measure limb length (true vs apparent).
    *   Assess range of motion (ROM) of adjacent joints.
    *   **Rotational assessment:** Compare with the normal side (e.g., make a fist to check for finger scissoring).
2.  **Radiography (X-rays):**
    *   **Standard views:** AP and Lateral views including joints above and below.
    *   Assess the degree of angulation and shortening.
    *   **Comparison views:** Essential in children to compare with the normal side.
3.  **CT Scan:**
    *   Essential for articular malunions to assess joint steps/gaps.
    *   Useful for evaluating complex rotational deformities (e.g., femoral version).

### Management
Not all malunions require treatment. The decision depends on the patient's age, functional demand, degree of deformity, and associated pain.

#### 1. Conservative Management (No Treatment)
Indicated if the deformity is minor, does not interfere with function, and is cosmetically acceptable.
*   **Remodeling potential:** In children, significant angulation in the plane of movement (flexion/extension) often remodels with growth. However, **rotational deformities do not remodel**.
*   **Shoe lifts:** To compensate for minor limb shortening.

#### 2. Operative Management ([[Osteotomy]])
Indicated for significant functional impairment, pain, or severe cosmetic deformity.

*   **Corrective Osteotomy:** The bone is surgically cut and realigned.
    *   **Closing Wedge Osteotomy:** A wedge of bone is removed from the convex side of the deformity. Easy to close, but causes slight shortening.
    *   **Opening Wedge Osteotomy:** A cut is made and opened on the concave side. Restores length but requires a [[Bone graft]].
    *   **Dome Osteotomy:** A curved cut allowing rotation of the fragment; good for adjusting alignment without losing length.
    *   **Derotation Osteotomy:** Specifically to correct rotational defects (e.g., in femur or tibia).

*   **Fixation:** After osteotomy, the bone is stabilized using:
    *   **Internal Fixation:** [[Plates and screws]] or intramedullary nails.
    *   **External Fixation:** Used for complex deformities.

*   **[[Ilizarov Technique]] (Distraction Osteogenesis):**
    *   Used for malunions associated with significant **shortening** or infection.
    *   Allows gradual correction of deformity and lengthening simultaneously.

### Complications of Malunion
1.  **Post-traumatic [[Osteoarthritis]]:** Especially in intra-articular malunions or lower limb malunions altering the mechanical axis.
2.  **Tardy Nerve Palsy:** E.g., [[Ulnar nerve]] palsy appearing years after a lateral condyle or supracondylar fracture malunion (cubitus valgus).
3.  **Functional Disability:** Difficulty walking or using the hand.
