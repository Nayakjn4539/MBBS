# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Enumerate diseases under National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP). Write down a brief note on integrated vector control. Describe in brief the national drug policy 2014 on Malaria.

### 1. Diseases Under National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP)

The [[NVBDCP]] is an umbrella programme for the prevention and control of vector-borne diseases in India. It covers the following six diseases:

1.  **Malaria**
2.  **Lymphatic Filariasis**
3.  **Kala-azar** (Visceral Leishmaniasis)
4.  **Japanese Encephalitis** (JE)
5.  **Dengue** / Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF)
6.  **Chikungunya** fever

> **M**y **F**ather **K**eeps **J**apanese **D**engue **C**hicks.

> *   **F**ilaria
> *   **K**ala-azar
> *   **J**apanese Encephalitis
> *   **D**engue

### 2. Integrated Vector Control (IVC)

[[Integrated Vector Control]] (also known as Integrated Vector Management or IVM) is a strategy that combines appropriate **biological, chemical, and environmental interventions** of proven efficacy, separately or in combination, to achieve effective vector control. It aims to reduce reliance on a single method (like chemical insecticides), minimize environmental pollution, and manage insecticide resistance.

**Key Components of IVC:**

*   **Environmental Control:** This offers the best approach as results are likely to be permanent.
    *   **Source Reduction:** Elimination of breeding places (e.g., filling ditches, drainage).
    *   **Water Management:** Intermittent irrigation, changing salinity of water.
    *   **Sanitation:** Proper disposal of refuse and sewage.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **[[Indoor Residual Spray]] (IRS):** Using DDT, Malathion, or Synthetic Pyrethroids.
    *   **Larvicides:** Use of chemical larvicides like Temephos or Abate.
    *   **Space Sprays:** For immediate reduction of adult mosquito density (e.g., during epidemics).
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Use of **Larvivorous fish** (e.g., *Gambusia affinis*, *Poecilia reticulata*).
    *   Use of biocides like *Bacillus thuringiensis*.
*   **Personal Protection:**
    *   Use of **[[Insecticide Treated Bed Nets]] (ITNs)** and **Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs)**.
    *   Screening of houses, wearing protective clothing, and using repellents.
*   **Genetic Control:** Techniques like sterile male technique, though largely in research phases.

**Clinical Relevance:**
IVC is critical because vector control by insecticides alone is no longer fully effective due to the development of resistance in over 100 species of arthropods.

### 3. National Drug Policy on Malaria (2013/2014)

The National Drug Policy on Malaria (2013) shifted the focus from presumptive treatment to radical cure based on confirmed diagnosis.

**Core Principles:**
*   **Diagnosis is Mandatory:** All fever cases suspected of malaria must be investigated by **Microscopy** or **[[Rapid Diagnostic Test]] (RDT)**.
*   **No Presumptive Treatment:** Antimalarial treatment is given *only* on the basis of a positive diagnosis.

**Treatment Protocols:**

**A. Uncomplicated *P. vivax* Malaria:**
*   **Drug of Choice:** **Chloroquine (CQ)** for 3 days + **Primaquine (PQ)** for 14 days.
*   **Purpose of Primaquine:** To prevent relapse (kill hypnozoites in the liver).
*   **Contraindications for Primaquine:** Infants, Pregnant women, and individuals with G6PD deficiency.

**B. Uncomplicated *P. falciparum* Malaria:**
*   **North-Eastern States:** **ACT-AL** (Artemether + Lumefantrine) for 3 days + Single dose **Primaquine** on Day 2.
*   **Other States:** **ACT-SP** ([[Artemisinin Combination Therapy]] - Artesunate + Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine) for 3 days + Single dose **Primaquine** on Day 2.
*   *Note:* The single dose of Primaquine in Falciparum is for gametocytocidal action (to stop transmission), not for relapse.

**C. Treatment in Pregnancy:**
*   **First Trimester:** **Quinine**.
*   **Second & Third Trimester:** **ACT**.
*   **Primaquine is CONTRAINDICATED throughout pregnancy**.

**D. Severe Malaria:**
*   Immediate referral to a facility.
*   **Initial:** Parenteral **Artemisinin derivatives** (Artesunate/Artemether) or **Quinine** for at least 48 hours.
*   **Follow-up:** Oral ACT (full course) once the patient can tolerate oral medication.

**E. Mixed Infections:**
*   Treated as **Falciparum Malaria** (ACT) + **Primaquine** for 14 days.

**Color-Coded Blister Packs for ACT-SP (Based on Age):**

| Age Group | Color of Blister Pack |
| :--- | :--- |
| **0 - 1 Year** | **Pink** |
| **1 - 4 Years** | **Yellow** |
| **5 - 8 Years** | **Green** |
| **9 - 14 Years** | **Red** |
| **15 Years & Above** | **White** |
