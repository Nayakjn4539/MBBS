# MUMPS (Infectious Parotitis)

An acute infectious disease caused by an RNA virus, characterized primarily by non-suppurative enlargement of one or both [[parotid glands]]. While generally benign, it can cause serious complications in adults.

### Epidemiological Determinants

| Feature | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Agent** | [[Myxovirus parotiditis]] (Genus *Rubulavirus*, Family *Paramyxoviridae*). Single stranded **RNA virus**. Only **one** serotype exists. |
| **Reservoir** | **Man** is the only known reservoir. |
| **Source of Infection** | Clinical and **subclinical cases** (30-40% cases are subclinical/inapparent). |
| **Infective Material** | Saliva, blood, urine, human milk, and CSF. |
| **Secondary Attack Rate** | **86%** (Highly infectious). |
| **Host Factors** | Affects all ages, but peak incidence is **5–9 years**. Rare in infants <6 months due to maternal antibodies. Immunity is lifelong after an attack. |
| **Environmental** | Occurs year-round; peak incidence in **winter and spring**. Favored by overcrowding. |

### Transmission Dynamics

*   **Mode of Transmission:**
    *   **Droplet infection** (coughing, sneezing).
    *   Direct contact with infected person.
    *   Fomites (articles soiled with nose/throat secretions).
*   **Incubation Period:** Varies from **2 to 4 weeks** (usually **14–18 days**).
*   **Period of Communicability:** From **4–6 days before** the onset of symptoms to **7 days after**. Maximum infectivity is just before and at the onset of parotitis.

### Clinical Picture

*   **Prodrome:** Fever (37.8–38.3°C), headache, malaise, and anorexia.
*   **Earache:** Often the first symptom; pain and stiffness on opening the mouth.
*   **Parotid Swelling:**
    *   Unilateral or bilateral tender swelling.
    *   Extends from the tip of the mastoid to the angle of the mandible.
    *   **Key Sign:** Obliteration of the space/sulcus between the **mastoid tip** and the **mandible angle** (differentiates it from cervical adenitis).
*   **[[Cowie's Sign]]:** Swelling and outpouching of the opening of Stensen’s duct (parotid duct) on the buccal mucosa opposite the 2nd upper molar.

### Complications

Mumps is a generalized viral infection; complications are frequent but usually not fatal.

| Organ System | Complication | Clinical Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Reproductive** | **[[Orchitis]]** | Occurs in 20–40% of post-pubertal males. Usually unilateral (bilateral is rare). Develops 7–10 days after parotitis. **Sterility is rare.** |
| | **Oophoritis** | 5% of post-pubertal females. Pelvic pain. |
| **CNS** | **Aseptic Meningitis** | Common (up to 10-15%). Benign course. |
| | **Encephalitis** | Rare (0.02–0.03%) but serious. Can lead to death. |
| **Gastrointestinal** | **Pancreatitis** | Upper abdominal pain, vomiting. A leading cause of pancreatitis in children. |
| **Sensory** | **Deafness** | Sensorineural hearing loss (unilateral/bilateral). Affects 5 per 100,000 cases. |

***Mnemonic for Complications: MUMPS***
*   **M** – Meningitis/Meningoencephalitis
*   **U** – Unilateral Orchitis (Balls feel like lumps)
*   **M** – Mastitis/Myocarditis (rare)
*   **P** – Pancreatitis
*   **S** – Sterility (Rare)/Sensorineural deafness

### Diagnosis

*   **Clinical:** Based on typical parotid swelling and history of exposure.
*   **Serology:** Detection of Mumps **IgM antibody** or 4-fold rise in IgG titers.
*   **Isolation:** Virus isolation from saliva, urine, or CSF.
*   **Other:** Raised serum amylase (due to parotitis or pancreatitis).

### Treatment

*   **Symptomatic:** Analgesics and antipyretics.
*   **Supportive:** Fluid intake.
*   **Antibiotics:** Not effective (viral etiology).
*   **Orchitis Management:** Bed rest, scrotal support, and cold compresses.

### Prevention and Control

**1. Vaccination**
*   **Type:** Live Attenuated Vaccine.
*   **Strains:** [[Jeryl Lynn]] (most common/safe), L-Zagreb, Urabe (associated with higher meningitis risk), Leningrad-3. **Rubini strain** is NOT recommended due to low effectiveness.
*   **Administration:**
    *   **Form:** Usually part of **[[MMR vaccine]]** (Measles, Mumps, Rubella).
    *   **Dose:** 0.5 ml.
    *   **Route:** Subcutaneous or IM.
    *   **Schedule:** 1st dose at **9-12 months**; 2nd dose at **4-6 years** (school entry).
*   **Contraindications:** Pregnancy, severe immunosuppression, severe allergy to neomycin/gelatin.

**2. Control of Spread**
*   **Isolation:** Isolate cases until the swelling has subsided (approx. 7–9 days).
*   **Disinfection:** Articles soiled with nose and throat secretions.
*   **Surveillance:** Monitor for outbreaks in schools/institutions.
