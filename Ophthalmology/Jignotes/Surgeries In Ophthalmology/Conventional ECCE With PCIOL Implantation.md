# [[Surgeries In Ophthalmology]] > Conventional ECCE With PCIOL Implantation

# Conventional ECCE with PCIOL Implantation

**Definition:** [[Extracapsular Cataract Extraction]] (ECCE) is a surgical technique where the major portion of the anterior capsule, the nucleus, and the cortex are removed, leaving behind the intact posterior capsule to support the [[Posterior Chamber Intraocular Lens]] (PCIOL).

### Indications
*   Hard cataracts (Grade IV and V) where phacoemulsification is difficult.
*   [[Corneal Endothelium]] decompensation (low cell count) where ultrasound energy is risky.
*   Lack of phacoemulsification equipment or training (common in developing countries).
*   Subluxated lens (with caution).

### Surgical Steps and Instrumentation

The surgery is typically performed under **Local Anaesthesia** ([[Peribulbar Block]] or [[Retrobulbar Block]]) using **Lignocaine 2%** and **Bupivacaine 0.5%**.

#### 1. Exposure and Fixation
*   **Goal:** To keep the eye open and stabilize the globe in a downward gaze.
*   **Instruments Used:**
    *   **[[Eye Speculum]] (Universal/Wire):** Keeps the lids apart. The wire speculum is lightweight and exerts minimal pressure on the globe (crucial to prevent vitreous prolapse).
    *   **[[Superior Rectus Holding Forceps]]:** A toothed forceps (1x2 teeth) with an S-shaped double curve. It is used to grasp the superior rectus muscle belly to pass a bridle suture.
    *   **[[Fixation Forceps]] (Globe Fixation Forceps):** Has 2x3 or 3x4 teeth. Applied near the limbus to hold the conjunctiva and episcleral tissue to stabilize the eye during incision.

#### 2. Incision (Corneoscleral Section)
*   **Goal:** To create an opening large enough (10–12 mm) to deliver the nucleus.
*   **Instruments Used:**
    *   **Razor Blade/Keratome:** Used to make the initial groove and entry.
    *   **[[Von Graefe’s Cataract Knife]]:** (Historical importance, largely replaced by keratomes). A long, narrow, thin, straight blade. Originally used to make an *ab-interno* corneoscleral incision.
    *   **[[Corneal Spring Scissors]] (Section Enlarging Scissors):** Fine curved scissors used to enlarge the corneoscleral section from 10 o'clock to 2 o'clock positions to allow nucleus delivery.

#### 3. Anterior Capsulotomy
*   **Goal:** To open the anterior capsule to access the lens.
*   **Technique:** **Can-Opener technique** is most common in conventional ECCE.
*   **Instruments Used:**
    *   **[[Cystitome]]:** Often made by bending a 26G needle. Used to make multiple small radial cuts (can-opener) in the anterior capsule 360 degrees.
    *   **[[Zeigler’s Knife]]:** A very fine knife originally used for discission (needling) of membranous cataracts; can be used for capsulotomy.
    *   **[[Capsulotomy Forceps]]:** Used if a Continuous Curvilinear Capsulorhexis (CCC) is attempted, or to remove the cut anterior capsule flap.

#### 4. Nucleus Delivery
*   **Goal:** To remove the hard nucleus without damaging the endothelium or rupturing the posterior capsule.
*   **Technique:** Pressure-Counterpressure method or Vectis method.
*   **Instruments Used:**
    *   **[[Lens Expressor]] (Lens Hook):** A flat metal handle with a rounded, knobbed curve. Applied at the limbus at 6 o'clock to exert pressure to tumble or slide the nucleus out.
    *   **[[McNamara’s Spoon]]:** A spoon-shaped instrument placed behind the nucleus (between nucleus and posterior capsule) to support it and glide it out, preventing it from dropping into the vitreous.
    *   **[[Vectis]] (Wire Vectis):** A wire loop attached to a handle. The loop is slid behind the nucleus to lift and withdraw it.
    *   **[[Irrigating Vectis]]:** A modified vectis made of hollow wire with openings at the anterior end. It allows hydrostatic pressure (via fluid injection) to help separate and deliver the nucleus while maintaining anterior chamber depth.

#### 5. Cortex Aspiration
*   **Goal:** Removal of soft cortical matter left behind.
*   **Instruments Used:**
    *   **[[Simcoe Cannula]] (Two-way I/A Cannula):** Has two openings/tubings. One connects to an infusion bottle (gravity feed) to maintain the chamber, and the other connects to a syringe for manual aspiration of cortex.

#### 6. IOL Implantation and Dialing
*   **Goal:** Placement of the PCIOL into the capsular bag or ciliary sulcus.
*   **Instruments Used:**
    *   **[[McPherson’s Forceps]]:** Fine forceps with bent limbs (angulated). Used to hold the IOL haptic or optic during insertion. Also used for suture tying.
    *   **[[Intraocular Lens Dialer]] (Sinskey Hook):** A fine stout instrument with a bent tip. Used to engage the dialing holes of the IOL optic to rotate (dial) the lens into the correct horizontal or vertical position within the bag.

#### 7. Wound Closure (Suturing)
*   **Goal:** Watertight closure of the large incision to prevent infection and astigmatism.
*   **Instruments Used:**
    *   **[[Iris Repositor]]:** A delicate, flat, malleable blade. Used to push the iris back into the AC, release peripheral synechiae, and ensure no iris tissue is caught in the wound.
    *   **[[Colibri Forceps]]:** Forceps with very fine 1x2 teeth. Used to hold the corneal or scleral edge of the incision during suturing.
    *   **[[Needle Holder]] (Barraquer/Castroviejo):** Used to hold the fine 10-0 nylon needle.
    *   **[[Suture Tier Forceps]]:** Fine limbs (often Kelman-McPherson or specific tying forceps) used to tie the suture knots.
    *   **[[Vannas’ Scissors]]:** Very fine delicate scissors with small cutting blades. Used to cut the 10-0 Nylon sutures.

### Instrument Summary Table

| Instrument | Features | Function in Conventional ECCE |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Eye Speculum]]** | Wire or solid blades (Universal/Barraquer) | Retracts eyelids; Wire type reduces pressure on globe. |
| **[[Superior Rectus Holding Forceps]]** | S-shaped, toothed (1x2) | Grasps superior rectus for bridle suture (fixation). |
| **[[Von Graefe’s Cataract Knife]]** | Long, narrow, straight blade | Historical instrument for corneoscleral incision. |

| **[[Lens Expressor]]** | Knobbed hook end | Applies external pressure at 6 o'clock to express nucleus. |
| **[[Vectis]] / [[Irrigating Vectis]]** | Wire loop (hollow if irrigating) | Slides behind nucleus for delivery; irrigating type adds fluid pressure. |
| **[[Simcoe Cannula]]** | Double-barreled cannula | Manual irrigation and aspiration of cortex. |
| **[[Intraocular Lens Dialer]]** | Angled tip (Sinskey Hook) | Dials/Rotates the IOL into position (bag/sulcus). |
| **[[Iris Repositor]]** | Flat, malleable blade | Reposits iris tissue; checks wound for incarcerations. |
| **[[Colibri Forceps]]** | Fine 1x2 teeth | Holds corneal edge for suturing. |
| **[[Vannas’ Scissors]]** | Very fine, spring-action | Cuts fine sutures (10-0 Nylon) or capsular tags. |

### Clinical Implications
*   **Astigmatism:** Because Conventional ECCE requires a large incision (10-12 mm) and sutures, **surgically induced astigmatism** is significantly higher compared to [[Phacoemulsification]] or [[SICS]].
*   **Posterior Capsule Rupture (PCR):** Can occur during nucleus delivery or cortex aspiration. If vitreous loss occurs, an **anterior vitrectomy** must be performed using automated cutters or sponge vitrectomy.
*   **[[Posterior Capsular Opacification]] (PCO):** Also known as "After-Cataract". Incidence is higher in ECCE. Treated with [[Nd:YAG Laser]] Capsulotomy.
*   **Use of Viscoelastics:** Essential to protect the corneal endothelium and maintain space during the large incision procedure.
