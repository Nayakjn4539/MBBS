# [[Cardiac Poisons]] > Hydrocyanic Acid

### [[Hydrocyanic Acid]] (Cyanide)

Hydrocyanic acid (HCN) is a highly toxic chemical, classified as a chemical asphyxiant, though often grouped with cardiac poisons due to rapid circulatory collapse. It is also known as **Prussic Acid**, **Cyanogen**, or **Scheele's Acid** (4% solution).

#### 1. Physical Properties and Sources
*   **State:** Can exist as gas (Hydrogen cyanide), liquid (Hydrocyanic acid), or solid salts (Potassium Cyanide - KCN, Sodium Cyanide - NaCN).
*   **Odor:** Distinct odour of **[[Bitter Almonds]]**.
    *   *Note:* About **20-40% of the population cannot perceive this smell** due to a sex-linked recessive trait.
*   **Sources:**
    *   **Plants:** Bitter almonds, cherry laurel, cassava, bamboo shoots, immature linseed (contain cyanogenic glycosides).
    *   **Occupational:** Electroplating, photography, gold/silver ore extraction, tanning, fumigation of ships.
    *   **Combustion:** Burning of plastics, polyurethane foam (household fires).

#### 2. Mechanism of Action
Cyanide causes **[[Histotoxic Anoxia]]** (Cytotoxic Anoxia).
1.  **Cytochrome Inhibition:** The Cyanide ion (CN⁻) has a high affinity for the **Ferric iron (Fe³⁺)** in the mitochondrial **[[Cytochrome Oxidase]]** enzyme system.
2.  **Cellular Halt:** It inhibits the enzyme, blocking the final step of oxidative phosphorylation.
3.  **Result:** Cells cannot utilize oxygen even though the blood is fully oxygenated. Aerobic metabolism stops, anaerobic glycolysis takes over, leading to lactic acidosis and cell death.

#### 3. Clinical Features (Signs and Symptoms)
The symptoms appear dramatically fast.
*   **Inhalation:** Immediate loss of consciousness and death within minutes.
*   **Ingestion:** Symptoms may be delayed for a few minutes (during which voluntary acts like corking the bottle or walking are possible).

**Systemic Manifestations:**
*   **CNS:** Headache, vertigo, confusion, characteristic **"Cry of distress"** (shriek) before collapsing, convulsions (epileptiform), dilated pupils, coma.
*   **Respiratory:** Initially rapid breathing (tachypnoea) due to chemoreceptor stimulation, followed by slow, gasping respiration and respiratory arrest.
*   **Cardiovascular:** Initial hypertension and bradycardia, rapidly progressing to hypotension, tachycardia, and cardiovascular collapse.
*   **G.I.T:** Bitter/burning taste, foaming at the mouth, constriction of the throat.
*   **Color:** The skin and mucous membranes may appear **Brick-red** or **Cherry-red** because the venous blood is oxygenated (tissues fail to extract oxygen).

#### 4. Fatal Dose and Fatal Period
| Form | Fatal Dose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pure Hydrocyanic Acid** | **50–60 mg** |
| **KCN or NaCN salts** | **200–300 mg** |
| **Bitter Almonds** | 50–60 numbers |

*   **Fatal Period:**
    *   Gas/Acid: 2–10 minutes (often immediate).
    *   Salts: ~30 minutes (delayed due to dissolution and release of HCN by gastric HCl).

#### 5. Diagnosis
*   **Smell:** Bitter almond odor in breath.
*   **Blood Gas:** Narrow arterial-venous oxygen difference (high venous O2).
*   **Lab Test:** **[[Lee-Jones Test]]** on stomach aspirate (positive result = greenish-blue color).

#### 6. Management and Treatment
Speed is critical. Treatment is based on dissociating cyanide from cytochrome oxidase.

**The Cyanide Antidote Kit (Lilly Kit) Protocol:**
| Step | Drug | Route | Mechanism of Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **[[Amyl Nitrite]]** | Inhalation | Forms Methemoglobin (Fe³⁺). Cyanide prefers Met-Hb over Cytochrome Oxidase, forming **Cyanmethemoglobin**. |
| **2** | **Sodium Nitrite** | IV (0.3g) | Potentiates Methemoglobin formation to trap more cyanide. |
| **3** | **Sodium Thiosulfate** | IV (25g) | Provides sulfur groups. Enzyme **[[Rhodanase]]** converts Cyanmethemoglobin to **Thiocyanate** (non-toxic and excreted in urine). |

**Alternative/Newer Antidotes:**
*   **[[Hydroxocobalamin]] (Vit B12a):** Combines with cyanide to form **Cyanocobalamin** (Vitamin B12), which is non-toxic. Dose: 4-5g IV. Safe and effective.
*   **Dicobalt Edetate (Kelocyanor):** Chelates cyanide directly. Effective but toxic.
*   **4-DMAP (4-Dimethylaminophenol):** Rapid methemoglobin former (used in Europe).

**General Measures:**
*   **100% Oxygen** therapy (helps reverse binding).
*   **Gastric Lavage:** With oxidizing agents like **Potassium Permanganate (1:5000)** or Sodium Thiosulfate.

> **Mnemonic for Treatment:** **N**itrites **M**ake **M**et-Hb (Trap), **T**hiosulfate **T**urns to **T**hiocyanate (Pee).

#### 7. Postmortem Findings (Autopsy)
**External:**
*   **Smell:** Odor of **bitter almonds** from the nose/mouth.
*   **Color:** **Cherry-red** or **Brick-red** postmortem staining (hypostasis).
*   **Face:** Eyes prominent, glistening, pupils dilated. Jaws firmly closed.
*   **Rigor Mortis:** Appears early.

**Internal:**
*   **Skull First:** **The cranial cavity should be opened FIRST** to detect the specific odor in the brain tissues before it is masked by the strong smell of the stomach contents.
*   **Stomach:** Mucosa may be swollen, red, or eroded. In salt poisoning (KCN/NaCN), the mucosa may be **blackened** and velvety due to the formation of **alkaline hematin** (caustic effect).
*   **Blood:** Bright red arterial-like blood in veins.
*   **Viscera:** Congested; petechial hemorrhages on pleura/pericardium.

**Sample Preservation:**
*   Viscera must be preserved in saturated saline (not alcohol/formalin).
*   **Spleen** is the best specimen for analysis (high RBC content).

#### 8. Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Suicide:** Ideal suicidal poison (small dose, rapid action). Common among photographers, jewelers, and chemists who have access.
*   **Homicide:** Rare due to strong smell and taste, but mass murders have occurred (e.g., **Jonestown Massacre**).
*   **Accidental:** Inhalation in labs or industries.
*   **Cattle Poisoning:** Ingestion of immature **Linseed plants** or Jowar (contain cyanogenic glycosides).
*   **Judicial Execution:** Used in gas chambers (generating HCN gas by dropping NaCN pellets into acid).
*   **Warfare:** Used as **Zyklon B** by Nazis in WWII.
