# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis

# Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (ELF)

**Lymphatic Filariasis (LF)**, widely known as Elephantiasis, is a major public health problem. The Government of India has prioritized its elimination under the [[National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP)]].

### **1. Goal and Definition of Elimination**
The aim is to eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis as a public health problem.
*   **Definition of Elimination:** The disease ceases to be a public health problem when the number of [[Microfilaria (Mf) carriers]] is **less than 1%** in the population, and children born after the initiation of the ELF program are free from circulating antigenaemia.
*   **Target:** To achieve elimination globally and in India (targets revised periodically, aligned with global goals like 2027/2030),.

### **2. Two-Pillar Strategy for Elimination**
The current strategy relies on two main components to break the chain of transmission and manage existing disease burden,.

#### **Pillar 1: Interruption of Transmission**
This is achieved through **Annual Mass Drug Administration (MDA)**.
*   **Concept:** Administration of single dose of antifilarial drugs to the entire eligible population in endemic areas once a year for **5–6 years**,.
*   **Rationale:** To reduce the density of microfilariae in the bloodstream to a level where transmission by the mosquito vector is no longer possible.
*   **Drug Regimens:**
    1.  **Double Drug Therapy (DA):** [[Diethylcarbamazine (DEC)]] (6 mg/kg) + [[Albendazole]] (400 mg),.
    2.  **Triple Drug Therapy (IDA):** Introduced in the **Accelerated Plan for Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (APELF)**. Includes **I**vermectin + **D**EC + **A**lbendazole,.
*   **Exclusion Criteria (Who should NOT get MDA):**
    *   **Children:** Below 2 years for DA regimen (Below 5 years for IDA regimen).
    *   **Pregnant Women.**
    *   **Seriously ill persons.**

> **Mnemonic for MDA Contraindications:**
> **"Baby, Belly, and Bedridden"**
> *   **Baby:** < 2 years (<5 for Ivermectin)
> *   **Belly:** Pregnant women
> *   **Bedridden:** Seriously ill patients

*   **DEC-Medicated Salt:** A supplementary form of mass treatment where common salt is medicated with 1–4 g of DEC per kg. Used in specific endemic areas (e.g., Lakshadweep) for 6–9 months,.

#### **Pillar 2: Morbidity Management and Disability Prevention (MMDP)**
Focuses on caring for patients already infected to prevent disability progression.
1.  **Home-based Management of Lymphoedema:**
    *   Washing feet/affected limbs with soap and water daily.
    *   Keeping the limb dry and elevating it to assist lymph drainage.
    *   Application of antifungal/antibiotic creams for entry lesions.
2.  **Hydrocele Management:** Upscaling of **Hydrocelectomy** operations in identified CHCs/District hospitals,.

### **3. Vector Control**
While chemotherapy is the primary strategy, vector control supplements it to reduce transmission.
*   **Anti-larval measures:** Using chemical larvicides like [[Temephos]] or biological control (Larvivorous fish) in breeding sites.
*   **Personal Prophylaxis:** Use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs).
*   **Source Reduction:** Elimination of breeding places like cesspools, soakage pits, and ill-maintained drains (vectors like *Culex quinquefasciatus* breed in polluted water).

---

### **4. Surveillance and Evaluation**
*   **Night Blood Survey:** Collection of 20 cu. mm blood between **8:30 PM and 12:00 Midnight** to detect microfilariae (due to nocturnal periodicity).
*   **Transmission Assessment Survey (TAS):** Conducted to determine if MDA can be stopped. The area must clear TAS-1, TAS-2, and TAS-3 to be declared free of transmission.
*   **Indicators:**
    *   **Microfilaria Rate (Mf Rate):** % of people with Mf in peripheral blood. Target is **<1%**.
    *   **Disease Rate (Endemicity Rate):** % of people with Mf or clinical disease.

---

### **Clinical Relevance**
*   **Acute Dermatolymphangioadenitis (ADLA):** Recurrent attacks of fever, pain, and swelling in the lymphedernous limb due to secondary bacterial infections. Preventing ADLA through foot hygiene is crucial to stop the progression to [[Elephantiasis]].
*   **Occult Filariasis:** Conditions like **Tropical Pulmonary Eosinophilia (TPE)** where Mf is not found in blood but patients have respiratory symptoms. Treated with DEC.
