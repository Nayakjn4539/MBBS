# [[Sports Injuries]] > Collateral Ligament Injuries of Knee

### **Collateral Ligament Injuries of the Knee (MCL/LCL)**

Injuries to the collateral ligaments are common in sports, resulting from direct contact or indirect twisting forces. The [[Medial Collateral Ligament]] (MCL) is injured much more frequently than the [[Lateral Collateral Ligament]] (LCL) due to the anatomical protection offered to the medial side of the leg by the opposite limb.

### **Relevant Anatomy**
The collateral ligaments are **extracapsular** and **extrasynovial** structures that provide **coronal plane stability** to the knee.
*   **[[Medial Collateral Ligament]] (MCL):** Resists valgus forces.
*   **[[Lateral Collateral Ligament]] (LCL):** Resists varus forces.

### **Mechanism of Injury**

| Ligament | Mechanism of Injury | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Medial Collateral Ligament]]** | **[[Valgus Force]]** | Caused by a blow to the **lateral** aspect of the knee (forcing the knee inwards) or non-contact twisting with external rotation. This is the **most common** ligament injured around the knee. |
| **[[Lateral Collateral Ligament]]** | **[[Varus Force]]** | Caused by a blow to the **medial** aspect of the knee (forcing the knee outwards). Less common due to protection by the other leg. |

**Clinical Implication:** [[Lateral Collateral Ligament]] injuries are often associated with injury to the [[Posterolateral Corner]] and the **[[Common Peroneal Nerve]]**, so always check distal neurovascular status.

### **Classification (Grading of Sprains)**

Ligament injuries are graded based on the severity of the tear and the degree of joint opening on stress testing.

*   **Grade I (Mild):** Microscopic tear. No loss of continuity. Joint opening **< 5 mm**.
*   **Grade II (Moderate):** Partial tear. Some loss of continuity. Joint opening **5–10 mm**.
*   **Grade III (Severe):** Complete rupture. Complete loss of continuity. Joint opening **> 10 mm** with no distinct endpoint (soft endpoint).

### **Clinical Features**

**History**
*   History of a twisting or wrenching injury.
*   Patient may report hearing a "pop" or snap.
*   **Pain:** Localized over the torn ligament (medial or lateral joint line).
*   **Swelling:**
    *   Usually appears **immediately** (unlike meniscal tears which swell gradually).
    *   If the capsule is torn, fluid may leak out, resulting in less tense swelling (diffuse).
    *   **[[Haemarthrosis]]** is common in Grade II and III injuries (usually within 2 hours).

**Physical Examination**
*   **Tenderness:** Localized over the femoral or tibial attachment of the ligament or along its course.
*   **Stress Tests:** The hallmark of diagnosis.
    *   **Technique:** The knee must be tested in **20°–30° of flexion**.
    *   *Why?* Full extension tightens the posterior capsule and cruciate ligaments, which can mask collateral instability. Flexion isolates the collateral ligaments.

| Test | Procedure | Positive Finding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Valgus Stress Test]]** | Apply force outwards (abduction) to the foot while stabilizing the knee laterally. | Pain or medial joint space opening indicates **MCL injury**. |
| **[[Varus Stress Test]]** | Apply force inwards (adduction) to the foot while stabilizing the knee medially. | Pain or lateral joint space opening indicates **LCL injury**. |

### **Diagnostic Imaging**

1.  **X-rays (Plain Radiographs):**
    *   Usually normal.
    *   May show an **avulsion fracture** (tiny chip of bone) at the ligament attachment.
    *   **Stress X-rays:** Can demonstrate abnormal opening of the joint space compared to the normal side.
2.  **[[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI):**
    *   **Investigation of Choice (IOC)** for ligament injuries.
    *   Best viewed in the **Coronal View**.
    *   Confirms the grade of the tear and identifies associated injuries (e.g., [[Meniscal Tear]], [[ACL Tear]]).

### **Treatment**

**1. Conservative Management**
Most collateral ligament injuries (Grade I, II, and isolated Grade III MCL) heal well without surgery because they are extra-articular and have good blood supply.
*   **Protocol (R.I.C.E):**
    *   **R**est.
    *   **I**ce packs (Cryotherapy).
    *   **C**ompression bandage.
    *   **E**levation.
*   **Immobilization:**
    *   **Cylindrical Cast** or **Functional Knee Brace** for 3–6 weeks depending on severity.
    *   Hinged braces allow early range of motion while protecting against varus/valgus stresses.
*   **Rehabilitation:**
    *   Isometric quadriceps exercises started immediately.
    *   Weight-bearing as tolerated (often with crutches initially).

**2. Surgical Management**
Surgery is rarely indicated for isolated collateral tears but is required for:
*   **Multi-ligament injuries:** e.g., MCL + ACL tear (O'Donoghue's Triad).
*   **Bony avulsions:** Re-attachment of the avulsed fragment using screws or suture anchors.
*   **Chronic Instability:** Late reconstruction using tendon grafts (e.g., semitendinosus or gracilis).
*   **Complete LCL tears:** These heal poorly compared to MCL and often require repair/reconstruction, especially if part of a posterolateral corner injury.

### **Complications**

1.  **[[Pellegrini-Stieda Disease]]**:
    *   Post-traumatic ossification (**[[Myositis Ossificans]]**) developing at the proximal attachment of the **[[Medial Collateral Ligament]]** (medial femoral condyle).
    *   **Clinical Features:** Persistent pain and tenderness on the medial side of the knee weeks/months after injury. A bony lump may be palpable.
    *   **X-ray:** Shows calcification near the medial femoral condyle.
2.  **Joint Stiffness:** Due to prolonged immobilization or adhesions (arthrofibrosis).
3.  **Instability:** If Grade III tears are not managed properly.

### **Mnemonic for Stress Tests**

*   **VAlgus** force makes the knees stick together (Gum) -> **Knock Knees** -> Tests **MCL**.
*   **VAruS** force makes the knees go apart (Air between them) -> **Bow Legs** -> Tests **LCL**.
