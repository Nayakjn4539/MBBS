### **Legitimacy**

**Definition**
[[Legitimacy]] is the legal status of a child born to a married couple. A child is considered legitimate if they are born in lawful wedlock. This status confers certain civil rights, such as inheritance and maintenance, upon the child,.

A child born out of wedlock is termed illegitimate (or a bastard/filus nullius).

### **Legal Presumption of Legitimacy (Section 112 IEA)**

According to **Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act**, the fact that any person was born:
1.  During the continuance of a valid marriage between their mother and any man, **OR**
2.  Within **280 days** after its dissolution, the mother remaining unmarried.

...shall be **conclusive proof** that they are the legitimate child of that man, unless it can be shown that the parties to the marriage had **no access** to each other at any time when the child could have been begotten,.

**Summary Table: Presumption of Legitimacy**

| Condition | Legal Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| Born during valid marriage | Legitimate |
| Born within 280 days of divorce/death of husband (Mother unmarried) | Legitimate |
| Born >280 days after dissolution | Illegitimate (unless proven otherwise) |
| Husband proves "Non-access" during conception | Illegitimate |

### **Grounds for Disproving Legitimacy**

To contest the legitimacy of a child, the husband (or interested party) must prove one of the following:
1.  **Non-Access:** The husband and wife had no opportunity for sexual intercourse during the time conception could have occurred (e.g., husband was abroad, in jail, or living separately).
2.  **Impotence/Sterility:** The husband was physically incapable of begetting children (e.g., [[Erectile Dysfunction]], Azoospermia) at the time of conception.
3.  **Blood/DNA Evidence:** Scientific proof (DNA profiling) establishes that the husband is not the biological father.
4.  **Beyond Statutory Period:** The child was born more than 280 days after the dissolution of marriage.

### **Medicolegal Aspects of Legitimacy**

The question of legitimacy arises in civil and criminal courts under the following circumstances:

**1. Inheritance of Property**
*   Only a legitimate child has the right to inherit ancestral property or titles from the father.
*   An illegitimate child generally has rights only to the mother's property (unless specific personal laws allow otherwise).

**2. Maintenance and Support**
*   Parents are legally bound to support legitimate children.
*   **Affiliation Cases:** An unmarried woman may allege a specific man is the father of her illegitimate child to claim maintenance. The court may order a medical exam/DNA test to establish [[Paternity]].

**3. Divorce and Nullity of Marriage**
*   **Adultery:** If a woman gives birth to a child when the husband had no access, it serves as proof of adultery, which is a ground for divorce.
*   **Nullity:** If a marriage is declared void (e.g., due to impotency), the legitimacy of children born during that period may be questioned.

**4. Supposititious Child**
*   A woman may feign pregnancy and delivery, then produce a child (often adopted or stolen) claiming it is her own to extort money, blackmail, or divert inheritance.
*   Medical examination of the woman for [[Signs of Remote Delivery]] is crucial here.

**5. Artificial Insemination (AI) & Surrogacy**
*   **AIH (Artificial Insemination by Husband):** Child is legitimate.
*   **AID (Artificial Insemination by Donor):** Since the husband is not the biological father, the child is technically illegitimate. The child must be legally adopted by the husband to secure legitimacy and inheritance rights. Written consent of both husband and wife is mandatory before the procedure to avoid legal pitfalls.
*   **Surrogacy:** The child born to a surrogate mother must be legally adopted by the commissioning couple to establish legitimacy.

### **Medical Evidence in Legitimacy Cases**

**1. DNA Fingerprinting (DNA Profiling)**
*   This is the most conclusive method.
*   DNA is extracted from blood, saliva, or other tissues.
*   It compares the genetic profile of the child with the mother and the alleged father.
*   **Accuracy:** It provides positive proof of paternity with >99.9% certainty,.

**2. Blood Grouping (ABO, Rh, MN systems)**
*   **Principle:** A child cannot possess an antigen/blood group factor not present in one or both parents.
*   **Limitation:** It can only **exclude** paternity (prove a man is *not* the father) but cannot positively prove he *is* the father (since many men share the same blood group),.

**3. Assessment of Sterility/Impotence**
*   Examination of the putative father for potency and semen analysis (sperm count, motility).
*   If the husband is proven sterile (e.g., permanent azoospermia), legitimacy is disproved.

**4. Duration of Pregnancy**
*   Medical evidence regarding the gestational age of the child is compared with the timeline of the couple's access to each other.
*   Example: A fully mature infant (3.5 kg) born 6 months after marriage suggests conception occurred before marriage.

**5. Superfetation and Superfecundation**
*   **Superfecundation:** Fertilization of two ova released in the same cycle by two separate acts of coitus within a short interval. This can result in twins of different fathers (one legitimate, one illegitimate).
*   **Superfetation:** Fertilization of a second ovum when a pregnancy is already established (extremely rare/theoretical in humans).

**Mnemonic for Disproving Legitimacy: "DNA"**
*   **D:** **D**ays (>280 days after dissolution)
*   **N:** **N**on-access (No opportunity for intercourse)
*   **A:** **A**bility lacking (Impotence/Sterility)
