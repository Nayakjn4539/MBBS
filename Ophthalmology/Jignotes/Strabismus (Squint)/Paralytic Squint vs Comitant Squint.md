# [[Strabismus (Squint)]] > Paralytic Squint vs Comitant Squint

### Overview of Strabismus (Squint)

[[Strabismus]], commonly known as **squint**, is a misalignment of the visual axes of the two eyes. It is broadly classified based on the consistency of the angle of deviation into **Comitant** (Concomitant) and **Incomitant** (Paralytic/Restrictive) strabismus.

***

### Comparison: Comitant vs. Paralytic Squint

The fundamental difference lies in the pathology: **Comitant squint** usually involves a defect in the afferent pathway (sensory) or central fusion mechanism with intact extraocular muscles/nerves, whereas **Paralytic squint** involves a lesion in the lower motor neuron pathway (nerve nucleus, nerve, or muscle itself).

#### Differences Table

| Feature | Comitant (Concomitant) Squint | Paralytic (Incomitant) Squint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Onset** | Usually gradual (insidious); often in childhood | Usually sudden |
| **Angle of Deviation** | **Constant** in all directions of gaze | **Variable**; increases in the field of action of the paralyzed muscle |
| **Ocular Movements** | **Full** (no limitation) | **Restricted/Limited** in the direction of action of the paralyzed muscle |
| **Diplopia** (Double Vision) | **Absent** (due to suppression or ARC) | **Present** (often the presenting symptom) |
| **Primary vs. Secondary Deviation** | **Equal** (Primary $\approx$ Secondary) | **Secondary > Primary** (Secondary deviation is greater) |
| **Head Posture** | Usually **Normal** | **Abnormal** (Turned/tilted to compensate) |
| **False Projection** | Negative (Normal localization) | **Positive** (Past-pointing) |
| **Nausea/Vertigo** | Absent | Present (due to confusion/diplopia) |
| **Sensory Adaptation** | Present ([[Amblyopia]], [[Suppression]], [[ARC]]) | Absent (in recent cases) |
| **Etiology** | Refractive errors, sensory obstacles (e.g., cataract) | Neurogenic (CN III, IV, VI palsy), Myogenic |

### Detailed Pathophysiology & Features

#### 1. Comitant Strabismus
In this condition, the efferent (motor) pathways are intact, but the fusion mechanism is defective or underdeveloped.

*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **Sensory Obstacles:** Conditions preventing clear image formation (e.g., [[Refractive Error]], [[Corneal Opacity]], [[Cataract]]) lead to dissociation of eyes.
    *   **Motor Obstacles:** Convergence/accommodation abnormalities (e.g., High AC/A ratio in accommodative esotropia).
*   **Deviation:** The angle remains the same whichever eye is fixing and in whatever direction the patient looks.
*   **Sensory Adaptations:** Because the onset is usually in childhood, the brain adapts to avoid [[Diplopia]]:
    *   **Suppression:** Cortical inhibition of the image from the squinting eye.
    *   **Amblyopia:** "Lazy eye" resulting from prolonged suppression.
    *   **Abnormal Retinal Correspondence (ARC):** The fovea of the fixing eye pairs with a non-foveal point of the squinting eye.

#### 2. Paralytic Strabismus
This results from the paralysis of one or more extraocular muscles due to lesions in the nerve nucleus, nerve trunk, or the muscle itself.

*   **Restriction of Movement:** The eye fails to move in the direction of the paralyzed muscle.
*   **Primary vs. Secondary Deviation:**
    *   **Primary Deviation:** Deviation of the affected eye when the normal eye fixes.
    *   **Secondary Deviation:** Deviation of the normal eye when the affected eye is forced to fix.
    *   **Clinical Law:** **Secondary Deviation > Primary Deviation**. Based on [[Hering's Law of Equal Innervation]]. To force the paretic muscle to fixate, the brain sends excessive innervation to it; this same excessive innervation is sent to the contralateral yoke muscle (synergist), causing a massive deviation in the normal eye.
*   **Compensatory Head Posture (CHP):** The patient adopts a head position that moves the eyes *away* from the field of action of the paralyzed muscle to minimize diplopia and permit binocular single vision.
    *   *Face Turn:* Towards the field of action of the paretic muscle.
    *   *Head Tilt:* seen in torsional/vertical diplopia (e.g., [[Trochlear Nerve Palsy]]).
*   **Pathological Sequelae (Muscle Sequelae):** Over time, muscle dynamics change:
    1.  **Overaction** of the contralateral synergist (Yoke muscle).
    2.  **Contracture** of the direct antagonist (ipsilateral).
    3.  **Secondary inhibitional palsy** of the contralateral antagonist.

> **Clinical Implication:** In a fresh paralytic squint, diplopia is the most distressing symptom. In old/neglected paralytic cases, the muscle sequelae set in, and the condition may start resembling a comitant squint (spread of comitance).

### Etiological Classification

#### Causes of Comitant Squint
1.  **Sensory:** High [[Hypermetropia]], [[Anisometropia]], Congenital Cataract, Retinoblastoma.
2.  **Motor:** Accommodation-Convergence anomalies (Accommodative Esotropia).
3.  **Central:** Defective development of fusion faculty.

#### Causes of Paralytic Squint
1.  **Neurogenic:**
    *   Congenital hypoplasia of nuclei.
    *   Inflammation ([[Meningitis]], [[Encephalitis]]).
    *   Vascular (Hypertension, Diabetes – causing microvascular ischemia).
    *   Trauma (Head injury involving CN VI, IV, III).
    *   Tumors (Intracranial space-occupying lesions).
2.  **Myogenic:**
    *   [[Myasthenia Gravis]].
    *   Thyroid Eye Disease (usually restrictive, but mimics paralysis).
    *   Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO).

### Diagnostic Tests

#### 1. Cover-Uncover Test
*   **Comitant:** Deviation is visible; the uncovered eye moves to take up fixation. The movement is equal regardless of which eye is covered.
*   **Paralytic:** The movement is sluggish or absent if the eye is required to move into the field of the paralyzed muscle.

#### 2. Ocular Movements (Ductions and Versions)
*   **Comitant:** Full range of motion.
*   **Paralytic:** Limitation in the specific gaze of the paretic muscle.

#### 3. Diplopia Charting & Hess Screen
*   **Comitant:** Not useful (no diplopia usually).
*   **Paralytic:**
    *   **Diplopia Charting:** Maximum separation of images occurs in the direction of action of the paralyzed muscle.
    *   **Hess Screen:** Differentiates the paretic muscle (smaller field) from the overacting muscle (larger field).

#### 4. Forced Duction Test (FDT)
Used to differentiate **Paralytic** (Nerve issue) from **Restrictive** (Mechanical issue) strabismus.
*   **Paralytic:** Negative FDT (Eye can be moved passively with forceps).
*   **Restrictive:** Positive FDT (Eye cannot be moved physically).
