# [[Communicable Diseases - Arthropod-Borne Infections]] > Dengue Syndrome

### Dengue Syndrome

Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that has rapidly spread to all regions of WHO in recent years. It is an acute febrile illness caused by the [[Arbovirus]] (arthropod-borne virus) and presents a wide clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe life-threatening shock.

#### 1. Epidemiological Determinants

**A. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** [[Dengue Virus]] (DENV).
*   **Family:** Flaviviridae (Group B Arbovirus).
*   **Serotypes:** There are 4 distinct serotypes: **DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4**.
    *   Infection with one serotype confers **lifelong immunity** to that specific serotype.
    *   However, cross-protection against other serotypes is partial and temporary (only a few months).
*   **Virulence:** Secondary infection (sequential infection with a different serotype) is a major risk factor for developing [[Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF)]] and [[Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS)]] due to **Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE)**.

**B. Vector Factors**
*   **Principal Vector:** [[Aedes aegypti]].
*   **Secondary Vector:** [[Aedes albopictus]] (Tiger mosquito).
*   **Habits of Aedes aegypti:**
    *   **Feeding:** Nervous feeder (bites multiple people to complete a meal), **Day biter** (peaks at dawn and dusk).
    *   **Breeding:** Artificial collections of water (desert coolers, flower pots, tires, coconut shells).
    *   **Resting:** Endophilic (rests indoors in dark corners/curtains).
    *   **Flight Range:** Short (approx 100 meters).

**C. Host Factors**
*   **Host:** Man.
*   **Age/Sex:** Affects all ages and genders. DHF is more common in children.
*   **High Risk for Severe Dengue:** Infants, elderly, obesity, pregnancy, peptic ulcer disease, and those with co-morbidities (diabetes, hypertension).

**D. Environmental Factors**
*   **Season:** Peaks in the rainy and post-monsoon season (July to November in India).
*   **Temperature:** 16°C–30°C is optimal for vector survival.
*   **Urbanization:** Unplanned urbanization and poor water management favor breeding.

#### 2. Transmission Dynamics

*   **Mode:** Bite of an infected female *Aedes* mosquito.
*   **Other Modes (Rare):** Vertical (mother to child), blood transfusion, needle stick injuries.
*   **Cycle:** Man $\rightarrow$ Mosquito $\rightarrow$ Man.
*   **Infective Material:** Blood of the patient.
*   **Infective Stage:** Mosquito remains infective for life once infected. Transovarian transmission (mother mosquito to eggs) also occurs.

---

#### 3. Time Periods

*   **Incubation Period (Intrinsic - in Man):** **3 to 10 days** (commonly 5–6 days).
*   **Extrinsic Incubation Period (in Mosquito):** **8 to 10 days** (time taken for the virus to multiply in the mosquito gut and reach salivary glands to become infective).
*   **Period of Communicability:** Patients are infective to mosquitoes from **1 day before** the onset of fever to **5 days after** the onset (during the viremia stage).

---

#### 4. Clinical Manifestations

The disease spectrum includes Undifferentiated Fever, Classical Dengue Fever (DF), and Severe Dengue (DHF/DSS).

**A. Classical Dengue Fever (Breakbone Fever)**
*   **Onset:** Sudden onset of high-grade fever.
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Severe **Frontal Headache**.
    *   **Retro-orbital pain** (pain behind the eyes, worsens with movement).
    *   Severe myalgia (muscle pain) and arthralgia (joint pain) $\rightarrow$ hence called **"Breakbone Fever"**.
    *   Rash: Measles-like rash may appear on the 3rd or 4th day.
    *   **Saddleback Fever:** Fever usually lasts 5-7 days, may subside for a day and return (biphasic).

**B. Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF)**
Defined by 4 WHO criteria:
1.  **Fever:** Acute onset, high grade.
2.  **Hemorrhagic Manifestations:** Positive [[Tourniquet Test]] (>20 petechiae per square inch), petechiae, ecchymosis, epistaxis, gum bleeding, or melena.
3.  **Thrombocytopenia:** Platelet count **< 100,000/mm³**.
4.  **Plasma Leakage (The Hallmark):** Evidence includes:
    *   Rise in Hematocrit ([[HCT]]) > 20% above baseline.
    *   Pleural effusion or Ascites.
    *   Hypoproteinemia.

**C. Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS)**
*   All criteria of DHF **PLUS** signs of circulatory failure:
    *   Rapid and weak pulse.
    *   Narrow pulse pressure (**< 20 mmHg**, e.g., 100/90 mmHg).
    *   Hypotension (Systolic < 90 mmHg).
    *   Cold, clammy skin and restlessness.

#### 5. Diagnosis

**A. Laboratory Diagnosis**
| Stage of Illness | Diagnostic Test of Choice |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Early (Day 1-5)** | **NS1 Antigen** (ELISA) or RT-PCR (Viral isolation) |
| **Late (Day >5)** | **IgM Antibody** (MAC-ELISA) |
| **Past Infection** | IgG Antibody (Paired sera showing 4-fold rise) |

**B. Hematological Findings**
*   **Leukopenia** (Low WBC) and Neutropenia.
*   **Thrombocytopenia** (Low platelets).
*   **Hemoconcentration:** Increased Hematocrit (HCT) indicates plasma leakage.

#### 6. Management and Treatment

There is **no specific antiviral drug**. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

**A. Dengue Fever (Non-Severe)**
*   **Home Management:**
    *   Bed rest.
    *   Plenty of oral fluids (ORS, fruit juices).
    *   **Antipyretics:** [[Paracetamol]] is the drug of choice.
    *   **Contraindication:** Do **NOT** give Aspirin, Ibuprofen, or NSAIDs (risk of bleeding and acidosis/Reye's syndrome in children).
    *   Tepid sponging for high fever.

**B. DHF/DSS (Severe)**
*   **Hospitalization is mandatory.**
*   **Fluid Management:** The key to survival.
    *   **Crystalloids:** Ringer’s Lactate (RL) or Normal Saline (0.9% NaCl).
    *   **Colloids:** Dextran 40 (used if crystalloids fail to maintain BP).
    *   Monitor **Hematocrit** and urine output rigorously.
*   **Blood Transfusion:** If HCT drops despite volume replacement (indicates significant occult bleeding).

#### 7. Surveillance Indicators (Vector Indices)

To assess the density of *Aedes* mosquitoes:
1.  **House Index (HI):** % of houses positive for larvae/pupae.
2.  **Container Index (CI):** % of water-holding containers positive for larvae.
3.  **Breteau Index (BI):** Number of positive containers per 100 houses inspected.
4.  **Aedes aegypti Index:** Target is < 1% in towns/seaports to prevent outbreaks (especially for Yellow Fever context).

---

#### 8. Prevention and Control

**A. Anti-Larval Measures (Source Reduction)**
*   Eliminate breeding sites: "Dry Day" once a week (empty coolers, pots).
*   Cover water tanks.
*   **Chemical:** Application of **Temephos** granules in potable water.
*   **Biological:** Use of larvivorous fish ([[Gambusia]], *Poecilia*) or *Bacillus thuringiensis* (biolarvicide).

**B. Anti-Adult Measures**
*   **Space Sprays:** Pyrethrum extract or Malathion fogging (thermal fogging) during outbreaks to kill adult mosquitoes.
*   **Genetic Control:** Sterile male technique.

**C. Personal Protection**
*   Use of mosquito nets (ITNs/LLINs).
*   Full-sleeved clothing.
*   Repellents (DEET).
*   Screening of windows.

---

#### 9. Vaccination

*   **Vaccine:** **CYD-TDV (Dengvaxia)**.
*   **Nature:** Live attenuated, tetravalent, recombinant vaccine.
*   **Schedule:** 3 doses (0, 6, 12 months).
*   **Crucial Limitation:** Recommended **ONLY** for individuals (9–45 years) who have **serological evidence of past dengue infection** (seropositive).
*   **Risk:** Giving it to seronegative individuals may increase the risk of severe dengue upon subsequent natural infection (due to Antibody-Dependent Enhancement).
