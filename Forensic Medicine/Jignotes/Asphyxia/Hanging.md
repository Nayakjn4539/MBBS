# [[Asphyxia]] > Hanging

### Definition
[[Hanging]] is a form of violent asphyxial death caused by the suspension of the body by a ligature which encircles the neck, the constricting force being the **weight of the body**.

### Classification

**1. Based on Degree of Suspension**
*   **Complete Hanging:** The body is completely suspended, and no part of the body touches the ground. The constricting force is the *entire* weight of the body.
*   **Partial Hanging:** The body is partially suspended; toes, feet, or knees touch the ground. The body may be in a sitting, kneeling, or semi-reclining posture. The constricting force is the *partial* weight of the body (head, chest, and arms).

**2. Based on Position of the Knot**
*   **Typical Hanging:** The knot is situated over the **occiput** (back of the head). The ligature runs symmetrically upwards on both sides of the neck.
*   **Atypical Hanging:** The knot is situated anywhere *other* than the occiput (e.g., under the chin, near the ear/mastoid process).

### Pathophysiology and Causes of Death
Death is rarely due to a single factor but rather a combination:

1.  **Asphyxia:** Occlusion of the airway (larynx/trachea) by the upward displacement of the root of the tongue against the posterior pharyngeal wall. **Tension required: 15 kg**.
2.  **Venous Congestion:** Blockage of jugular veins leads to cerebral congestion and unconsciousness. **Tension required: 2 kg**.
3.  **Cerebral Ischemia (Cerebral Anemia):** Occlusion of carotid arteries cuts off blood supply to the brain. **Tension required: 3-5 kg** (Carotids), **30 kg** (Vertebral arteries).
4.  **Reflex Vagal Inhibition:** Pressure on the vagal sheath or [[carotid body]] causes sudden cardiac arrest.
5.  **Fracture-Dislocation of Cervical Vertebrae:** Specifically seen in **Judicial Hanging** (long drop). Typically involves fracture of C2-C3 ([[Hangman's Fracture]]) with transection of the spinal cord.

*   **Most Common Cause:** Combined Asphyxia and Venous Congestion.

### Fatal Period
*   **3 to 5 minutes**.
*   Heartbeats may continue for 10–15 minutes after respiration ceases.

### Autopsy Findings

#### A. External Findings
**1. Ligature Mark (Groove/Furrow)**
*   **Nature:** It is a pressure abrasion.
*   **Appearance:** Dry, hard, and parchment-like (yellowish-brown) due to the removal of the epidermis.
*   **Position:** Usually situated **above the level of the thyroid cartilage** (in 80% of cases).
*   **Direction:** **Oblique** (runs upwards towards the knot).
*   **Continuity:** **Incomplete** (interrupted at the point of the knot/suspension).
*   **Pattern:** Often reproduces the pattern of the ligature material (e.g., rope weave).

**2. Face and Head**
*   **Color:** Usually **pale** in complete hanging (due to rapid arterial compression). Can be congested/cyanosed in partial hanging or strangulation.
*   **Eyes:** Pupils usually dilated.
*   **Tongue:** Often swollen, blue, and protruded (forced out by ligature pressure).
*   **[[Saliva Dribbling]]:** Saliva dribbling from the angle of the mouth *opposite* to the knot. This is a **surest sign of antemortem hanging**. It indicates vital function (salivary secretion) stimulated by ligature pressure.
*   **[[Le Facies Sympathique]]:** Rare sign. One eye remains open with a dilated pupil, while the other is closed. Caused by pressure on the cervical sympathetic chain on the side of the knot.

**3. Postmortem Hypostasis (Lividity)**
*   If suspended for >4 hours: **Glove and Stocking distribution** (hypostasis in lower limbs, hands, and forearms) due to gravity.
*   *Note:* If the body is cut down early, lividity will settle on the back (dependent parts).

#### B. Internal Findings
*   **Neck Tissues:** Subcutaneous tissue under the ligature mark is dry, white, and glistening.
*   **Muscles:** Sternomastoid muscle may show rupture or hemorrhage (sternomastoid ecchymosis).
*   **Arteries:** **[[Amussat’s Sign]]**: Transverse intimal tears in the carotid arteries (intima and media rupture due to stretching).
*   **Hyoid Bone:** Fracture may occur (15-20% cases), usually in the elderly due to ossification.
    *   *Direction of Fracture:* **Anteroposterior compression** causes outward displacement of fragments.
*   **[[Simon's Hemorrhage]]:** Hemorrhage into the intervertebral discs of lumbar vertebrae due to traction and stretching of the body.

### Medicolegal Aspects

1.  **Suicide:** Hanging is the most common method of suicide.
    *   *Features:* Accessible point of suspension, absence of struggle marks, presence of suicide note, inverted 'V' pattern of ligature mark.
2.  **Homicide ([[Lynching]]):** Rare. Usually involves multiple assailants. Victim is rendered unconscious first or overpowered. Signs of struggle/drag marks present.
3.  **Accident:** Rare. Usually seen in children playing or in **sexual asphyxia** ([[Autoerotic asphyxia]]) where partial hypoxia is induced for sexual gratification.
4.  **Judicial Hanging:** Legal mode of execution in India. Death is instantaneous due to dislocation of C2-C3 vertebrae.
5.  **Postmortem Hanging:** A person is killed by other means, and the body is suspended to simulate suicide.
    *   *Key Clue:* Absence of vital reactions (no dribbling of saliva, no hemorrhage in neck layers). Ligature mark looks pale or yellow but lacks vital reaction features.

### Differentiating Hanging from Ligature Strangulation

| Feature | Hanging | Ligature Strangulation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Constricting Force** | Body weight | External force (Assailant) |
| **Ligature Mark Direction** | **Oblique** (running up to knot) | **Transverse** (Horizontal) |
| **Ligature Mark Level** | **Above** thyroid cartilage | **Below** or at thyroid cartilage |
| **Ligature Mark Continuity**| **Incomplete** (gap at knot) | **Complete** (encircles neck) |
| **Base of Mark** | Dry, hard, parchment-like | Soft, reddish |
| **Subcutaneous Tissue** | Dry, white, glistening | Ecchymosed, bruised |
| **Hyoid Bone Fracture** | Outward displacement | Inward displacement (if present) |
| **Saliva Dribbling** | Often present (**Diagnostic**) | Absent |
| **Signs of Asphyxia** | Less marked (Face pale) | Very marked (Face congested) |
| **Thyroid Cartilage** | Injury rare | Injury common |
| **Manner** | Mostly **Suicidal** | Mostly **Homicidal** |
