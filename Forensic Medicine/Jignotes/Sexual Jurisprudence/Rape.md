# [[Sexual Jurisprudence]] > Rape

### **Rape: Definition and Legal Provisions**

**Rape** is a legal term, not a medical diagnosis. It is derived from the Latin word *'Rapere'*, meaning to seize. It is considered a heinous crime against the human body and dignity.

#### **I. Legal Definition (Section 375 IPC / Section 63 BNS)**

Under **Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC)** (Corresponding to **Section 63** of the **Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita [BNS]**), a man is said to commit "rape" if he performs any of the following acts with a woman under specific circumstances:

**A. The Criminal Acts (Actus Reus):**
1.  **Penetrates his penis**, to any extent, into the vagina, mouth, urethra, or anus of a woman or makes her do so with him or any other person.
2.  **Inserts, to any extent, any object** or a part of the body, not being the penis, into the vagina, the urethra, or anus of a woman or makes her do so with him or any other person.
3.  **Manipulates any part of the body** of a woman so as to cause penetration into the vagina, urethra, or anus or makes her do so with him or any other person.
4.  **Applies his mouth** to the vagina, anus, or urethra of a woman or makes her do so with him or any other person.

**B. The Circumstances (Lack of Valid Consent):**
The act constitutes rape if it falls under any of the following **seven descriptions**:
1.  **Against her will.**
2.  **Without her consent.**
3.  **With her consent**, when her consent has been obtained by putting her or any person in whom she is interested in **fear of death or of hurt**.
4.  **With her consent**, when the man knows that he is not her husband and that her consent is given because she believes that he is another man to whom she is or believes herself to be lawfully married (**Fraud/Personation**).
5.  **With her consent**, when at the time of giving such consent, by reason of **unsoundness of mind or intoxication** or the administration by him personally or through another of any stupefying or unwholesome substance, she is unable to understand the nature and consequences of that to which she gives consent.
6.  **With or without her consent**, when she is **under 18 years of age** (Statutory Rape).
7.  **When she is unable to communicate consent.**

> **Note:** **Penetration** is sufficient to constitute the sexual intercourse necessary to the offense of rape. Ejaculation is **not** necessary.

**Exceptions:**
*   **Marital Rape Exception:** Sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under **18 years of age** (previously 15 years), is **not rape** (Exception 2 to Sec 375 IPC).

#### **II. Important Concepts of Consent**

*   **Definition:** Consent means an unequivocal voluntary agreement when the woman by words, gestures, or any form of verbal or non-verbal communication, communicates willingness to participate in the specific sexual act.
*   **Silence is not Consent:** A woman who does not physically resist to the act of penetration shall not by the reason only of that fact be regarded as consenting to the sexual activity.
*   **Revocation:** Consent can be withdrawn at any point.

> **Mnemonic for Invalid Consent: "FUIM"**
> *   **F** - Fear (of death/hurt)
> *   **U** - Underage (<18 years)
> *   **I** - Intoxication/Insanity
> *   **M** - Misconception of fact (Fraud/Impersonation)

#### **III. Punishments (Section 376 IPC / Section 64 BNS)**

Rape is a **cognizable, non-bailable, and non-compoundable** offense.

*(RI = Rigorous Imprisonment)*

#### **IV. Procedural Laws and Medical Duties**

**1. Medical Examination of the Survivor/Victim ([[Section 164A CrPC]] / Section 184 BNSS):**
*   Examination must be conducted by a Registered Medical Practitioner (RMP) employed in a government hospital (or any other RMP if govt not available).
*   **Consent:** Victim's consent is **mandatory**.
*   **Timing:** Within **24 hours** of receiving information.
*   **Report:** Must include name, age, description of injuries, mental state, and exact time of exam.
*   **Conclusion:** Must state precise reasons for each conclusion.

**2. Medical Examination of the Accused ([[Section 53A CrPC]] / Section 52 BNSS):**
*   Request must come from a police officer not below the rank of **Sub-Inspector**.
*   **Force:** Reasonable force **can** be used if the accused refuses.
*   The examination aims to find evidence connecting the accused to the crime (e.g., [[DNA profiling]], injuries of struggle).

**3. Mandatory Treatment ([[Section 357C CrPC]]):**
*   All hospitals (public or private) **must** provide first-aid or medical treatment **free of cost** to victims of rape and acid attacks.
*   Failure to do so is punishable under **Section 166B IPC**.

**4. Court Proceedings:**
*   **In-Camera Trial ([[Section 327 CrPC]]):** The inquiry and trial of rape shall be conducted in a closed room (not open to public) to protect the victim's dignity.
*   **Identity Protection (Section 228A IPC / Section 72 BNS):** Disclosure of the identity of the rape victim is a punishable offense.

**5. Evidence Act Provisions:**
*   **Presumption of Absence of Consent ([[Section 114A IEA]]):** In a prosecution for rape, if the sexual intercourse is proved and the woman states she did not consent, the court **shall presume** she did not consent.
*   **Character Assassination:** Evidence regarding the past sexual experience or "immoral character" of the victim is **irrelevant** and inadmissible to prove consent.

#### **V. Important Medicolegal Aspects**

*   **Diagnosis:** A doctor **cannot** diagnose rape. Rape is a legal verdict. The medical officer's opinion should be: *"There are signs of recent sexual intercourse/vaginal penetration/physical injury/intoxication, and the findings are consistent/not consistent with the history provided."*
*   **Two-Finger Test:** The Supreme Court of India and MOHFW guidelines have **banned** the "Two-Finger Test" (per vaginal examination to assess laxity of vagina/habituation to sex). It is unscientific and violates the victim's integrity.
*   **Examination Kit:** Use of the standard **Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence (SAFE)** kit or **Rape Kit** is recommended for collection of evidence.
*   **False Accusation:** Medical evidence (absence of injuries, intact hymen in some cases, negative seminal stains) can help verify or refute claims, though absence of injury does not rule out rape.
