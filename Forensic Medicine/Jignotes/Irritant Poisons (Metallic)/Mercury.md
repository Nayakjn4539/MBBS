# [[Irritant Poisons (Metallic)]] > Mercury

### **Mercury (Quicksilver/Para)**

Mercury is a liquid metal with a bright silvery appearance, volatile at room temperature. It is the only metal that remains liquid at room temperature.

### **Classification and Forms**

The toxicity and target organs depend heavily on the chemical form of mercury.

| Form | Examples | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Elemental (Metallic)** | Liquid mercury, Vapour | **Liquid:** Non-poisonous if swallowed (poorly absorbed). <br> **Vapour:** Highly toxic via inhalation (crosses blood-brain barrier)., |
| **Inorganic Salts** | **Mercuric salts (Hg2+):** Corrosive Sublimate (HgCl2), Mercuric cyanide. <br> **Mercurous salts (Hg1+):** Calomel (Hg2Cl2). | **Mercuric:** Soluble, corrosive, highly toxic. <br> **Mercurous:** Insoluble, less toxic (cathartic). <br> **Target:** Kidneys (Nephrotoxic).,, |
| **Organic Compounds** | Methyl mercury, Ethyl mercury. | High lipid solubility. Crosses blood-brain barrier. <br> **Target:** CNS (Neurotoxic). Associated with Minamata disease., |

**Note:** [[Cinnabar]] (Mercuric sulfide) is a red powder used as vermilion; it is insoluble and non-poisonous.

### **Mechanism of Action**
*   **Enzyme Inhibition:** Mercury ions bind with **[[sulfhydryl groups]]** (-SH) of cellular enzymes and proteins, inhibiting their function,.
*   **Cellular Damage:** Causes pathological alteration of cellular membranes. Inorganic salts precipitate proteins (corrosive action),.

---

### **Clinical Features**

#### **1. Acute Poisoning**
Usually due to ingestion of inorganic salts like Mercuric Chloride ([[Corrosive sublimate]]).

*   **Gastrointestinal (Immediate):**
    *   **Metallic taste**, feeling of constriction in throat, hoarse voice.
    *   **Corrosion:** Mouth, tongue, and fauces become swollen and show a **grayish-white coating**,.
    *   Nausea, retching, and vomiting (vomitus contains grayish, slimy mucoid material with blood).
    *   **Bloody diarrhea** with tenesmus.
*   **Renal (Delayed - 2 to 3 days):**
    *   Mercury concentrates in kidneys causing **[[Acute Tubular Necrosis]]**.
    *   Oliguria, albuminuria, hematuria, progressing to anuria and uremia.
*   **Systemic:** Circulatory collapse (shock) due to fluid loss.

#### **2. Chronic Poisoning (Hydrargyrism)**
Usually due to occupational exposure (glass blowing, hat making, thermometer industry).

**Classic Triad:** Oral signs + Tremors + Erethism.

*   **Oral Changes:**
    *   Increased salivation (pialism), metallic taste.
    *   Inflammation of gums (spongy and bleeding).
    *   **Blue line** on gums (Mercurial line) at the junction with teeth,.
    *   Loosening of teeth.
*   **Tremors (Danbury Tremors / Hatter's Shakes):**
    *   Coarse, intentional tremors interspersed with jerky movements.
    *   **Progression:** Fingers/Hands $\rightarrow$ Eyelids/Tongue/Lips $\rightarrow$ Arms/Legs.
    *   **Handwriting test:** Handwriting becomes shaky and illegible.
    *   Severe form: **Concussio mercurialis** (patient cannot dress or eat).
*   **Psychological Changes ([[Erethism]]):**
    *   Also known as **"Mad Hatter Syndrome"**.
    *   Features: Shyness, timidity, anxiety, depression, loss of confidence, irritability, and loss of memory,.
*   **Eye Changes ([[Mercurialentis]]):**
    *   Deposition of mercury on the anterior lens capsule.
    *   Slit-lamp exam shows a **brown reflex**. Does *not* affect visual acuity.
*   **Skin:**
    *   Chronic dermatitis, hyperkeratosis.

#### **3. Acrodynia (Pink Disease)**
*   Occurs in children due to hypersensitivity (formerly from calomel in teething powders).
*   **Features:** Pinkish rash, peeling of skin from hands/feet, painful/swollen extremities, photophobia, and irritability,.

#### **4. Minamata Disease**
*   Caused by consumption of fish contaminated with **[[Methyl mercury]]** (Organic).
*   First occurred in Minamata Bay, Japan (1953–1960).
*   **Symptoms:** Ataxia, numbness (paresthesia), tunnel vision (constriction of visual fields), hearing loss, and mental deterioration,.
*   Fetuses exposed in utero developed cerebral palsy-like symptoms.

---

### **Fatal Dose and Period**
*   **Fatal Dose:**
    *   Mercuric chloride: **1 to 2 g**,.
    *   Methyl mercury: 10–60 mg/kg.
*   **Fatal Period:** 3 to 5 days,.

---

### **Treatment**

#### **Acute Poisoning**
1.  **Decontamination:**
    *   **Precipitation:** Give **egg whites** (albumin) or milk immediately to precipitate mercury into insoluble albuminate. This must be removed by gastric lavage to prevent re-absorption,.
    *   **Gastric Lavage:** With **5% [[Sodium Formaldehyde Sulfoxylate]]**. It reduces toxic mercuric chloride to less toxic metallic mercury,.
    *   Activated charcoal.
2.  **Antidotes (Chelation):**
    *   **[[BAL]] (British Anti-Lewisite / Dimercaprol):** Traditional chelator. 3-5 mg/kg IM every 4 hours.
    *   **D-Penicillamine:** Oral chelating agent.
    *   **[[DMSA]] (Succimer):** Oral, effective, and less toxic than BAL,.
3.  **Supportive:**
    *   Maintain fluid and electrolytes (treat shock).
    *   **Hemodialysis** if renal failure (anuria) sets in.

#### **Chronic Poisoning**
*   Remove patient from source of exposure.
*   **N-acetyl penicillamine** is the chelator of choice.
*   Symptomatic treatment for tremors and gingivitis.

### **Autopsy Findings**

1.  **Gastrointestinal Tract:**
    *   Mucosa of mouth, throat, and stomach is **greyish-white**, sodden, and inflamed,.
    *   Submucous hemorrhages and corrosion.
    *   **Large Intestine:** May show ulceration and necrosis (resembling dysentery) due to re-excretion of mercury through colonic mucosa (seen in delayed deaths),.
2.  **Kidneys:**
    *   **[[Large White Kidney]]**: Swollen, pale kidneys due to cortical edema.
    *   Microscopy: Necrosis of Proximal Convoluted Tubules (PCT) and calcification,.
3.  **Liver:** Cloudy swelling and fatty degeneration.

---

### **Medicolegal Aspects**
*   **Accidental:** Most common. Broken thermometers in children, industrial exposure, or absorption from ointments/vaginal douches.
*   **Suicidal:** Inorganic salts (mercuric chloride) are sometimes used.
*   **Homicidal:** Rare due to metallic taste and difficulty in administration.
*   **Occupational Hazard:** Risk for dentists (amalgams), thermometer makers, and chemical industry workers.
