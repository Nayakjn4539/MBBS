# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Home available fluids in diarrhoea

### Home Available Fluids (HAF) in Diarrhoea

**Definition:** [[Home Available Fluids (HAF)]] constitute the first line of management in acute diarrhoea to prevent dehydration. They are locally available, culturally acceptable, and affordable fluids used primarily for **Treatment Plan A** (No Dehydration).

#### 1. Principles of Management (Plan A)
The management of diarrhoea at home is based on three essential rules:
1.  **Give more fluids than usual** to prevent dehydration.
2.  **Continue feeding** to prevent [[malnutrition]].
3.  **Watch for signs of dehydration** and bring the child to a health worker if the condition worsens.

#### 2. Recommended Home Available Fluids (HAF)
These fluids can be broadly classified into two categories based on their salt content.

**A. Fluids that naturally contain salt (Ideal):**
*   **Salted Soup:** Vegetable or chicken soup.
*   **Salted Rice Water:** Water drained from cooked rice with added salt.
*   **Buttermilk/Lassi:** Yoghurt-based drinks.
*   **Dal Water:** Liquid from cooked lentils.
*   **Sikanji:** Lemon water with salt and sugar.

**B. Fluids that do not contain salt:**
*   **Plain Water:** Should be given, but ideally along with food to provide electrolytes.
*   **Green Coconut Water:** Excellent source of potassium.
*   **Weak Tea:** Unsweetened.
*   **Unsalted Rice Water:** Cereal water.

**Clinical Note:** If fluids like unsalted rice water or soup are used, mothers must be taught to add salt (**approx. 3g/litre**) to the drink during diarrhoea.

| **Type of Fluid** | **Examples** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cereal Based** | [[Rice water]], Dal water, Cereal gruel |
| **Milk Based** | Buttermilk, Yoghurt drinks, Breast milk (continue feeding) |
| **Others** | Green coconut water, Weak tea, Fresh fruit juice, Clean plain water |

#### 3. Fluids to AVOID [[Dangerous Fluids]]
Certain fluids can worsen diarrhoea due to high osmolarity or diuretic effects. These must **NOT** be given.

*   **Commercial Carbonated Beverages:** Cause osmotic diarrhoea due to high sugar.
*   **Commercial Fruit Juices:** High sugar load.
*   **Sweetened Tea/Coffee:** Stimulant and diuretic effect leads to increased fluid loss.
*   **Medicinal Teas or Infusions:** Potential purgative effects.

> **Mnemonic for Fluids to AVOID: "SCAM"**
> *   **S**weetened drinks/juices
> *   **C**offee
> *   **A**erated drinks (Carbonated)
> *   **M**edicinal teas

#### 4. Administration Guidelines (How much to give?)
The general rule is to give as much fluid as the child wants. Approximate amounts after *each* loose stool:

*   **Children < 2 years:** 50–100 ml (¼ to ½ cup).
*   **Children 2–10 years:** 100–200 ml (½ to 1 cup).
*   **Older children & Adults:** As much as they want.

**Technique:**
*   Give frequent small sips from a cup.
*   If the child vomits, wait **10 minutes**, then try again slowly (spoonful every 2–3 minutes).

#### 5. Clinical Relevance
*   **Plan A Only:** [[Home Available Fluids]] are indicated *only* when there are **No Signs of Dehydration**.
*   **Plan B & C:** If the child shows signs of *Some* or *Severe* dehydration (sunken eyes, skin pinch goes back slowly, irritable/lethargic), HAF is insufficient. They require [[ORS]] (Oral Rehydration Salts) or IV fluids respectively.
*   **Zinc Supplementation:** HAF should be accompanied by [[Zinc supplementation]] (20mg/day for 14 days; 10mg for infants <6 months) to reduce severity and duration.
