# [[Screening For Disease]] > Concept and Criteria for Screening

### Concept of Screening

[[Screening]] is defined as the active search for unrecognized disease or defect in apparently healthy individuals by means of rapidly applied tests, examinations, or other procedures.

It acts as a filter to separate the **apparently healthy** population into two groups:
1.  Those who likely have the disease.
2.  Those who are unlikely to have the disease.

#### The "Iceberg Phenomenon" of Disease
*   **Concept:** Disease in a community is often compared to an iceberg.
*   **Floating Tip:** Represents the **clinical cases** (symptomatic) seen by clinicians.
*   **Submerged Portion:** Represents the **hidden mass** of disease (pre-symptomatic, sub-clinical, undiagnosed cases, and carriers).
*   **Objective:** The epidemiologist and screening programs aim to detect the submerged portion to prevent the onset of severe disease.

> Draw an iceberg floating in water. Label the tip above water as "Clinical Cases/What Physician Sees" and the large submerged part as "Pre-symptomatic/Carriers/What Epidemiologist Sees". Draw a water line separating them.

#### Concept of Lead Time
*   **Definition:** The period between the diagnosis of a disease by screening (early detection) and the usual time of diagnosis by clinical symptoms.
*   **Goal:** To gain [[Lead Time]] so that treatment can be initiated early, leading to a better prognosis.

### Screening vs. Diagnostic Tests

This is a favorite exam comparison question.

| Feature | Screening Test | Diagnostic Test |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Target Population** | Apparently healthy individuals | Sick patients with signs/symptoms |
| **Purpose** | To identify risk/early disease | To establish a definitive diagnosis |
| **Application** | Applied to groups/populations | Applied to single individuals |
| **Result** | Arbitrary and final (for the screening phase) | Not final; modified by new evidence |
| **Basis** | Based on one criterion or cut-off point | Based on a constellation of signs/symptoms/labs |
| **Accuracy** | Less accurate | More accurate |
| **Cost** | Relatively inexpensive | Expensive |
| **Initiative** | Comes from the investigator/agency | Comes from the patient (complaint) |

### Criteria for Screening (Wilson and Jungner Criteria)

Before initiating a screening program, specific criteria must be met regarding the disease, the test, and the healthcare system.

#### A. Criteria related to the [[Disease]]
1.  **Important Health Problem:** The disease should have a high prevalence and pose a significant threat to public health.
2.  **Recognizable Latent Stage:** There must be a [[Preclinical Phase]] or early asymptomatic stage where detection is possible.
3.  **Known Natural History:** The progression from latent to declared disease should be adequately understood.
4.  **Effective Treatment:** There must be an effective treatment available. Screening is unethical if the disease cannot be treated.

#### B. Criteria related to the [[Screening Test]]
1.  **Valid (Accuracy):** The test must be able to distinguish diseased from non-diseased people.
    *   **Sensitivity:** Ability to correctly identify those *with* the disease (True Positives).
    *   **Specificity:** Ability to correctly identify those *without* the disease (True Negatives).
2.  **Reliable (Precision/Repeatability):** The test must give consistent results when repeated.
3.  **Acceptable:** The test should be safe, painless, and acceptable to the population (e.g., non-invasive).
4.  **Simple and Rapid:** It should be easy to administer and quick to perform.
5.  **Economical:** The cost of case-finding must be economically balanced in relation to total medical expenditure.

#### C. Criteria related to the System/Implementation
1.  **Facilities Available:** Resources for diagnosis and treatment must be available for those who test positive.
2.  **Agreed Policy:** There must be a clear policy on whom to treat (e.g., borderline cases).
3.  **Continuous Process:** Case-finding should be a continuous process, not a "once and for all" project.

> **Mnemonic for Screening Criteria: "SAFE TEA"**
> *   **S** - **S**ignificant public health problem.
> *   **A** - **A**cceptable and Accurate test.
> *   **F** - **F**acilities for diagnosis/treatment available.
> *   **E** - **E**arly asymptomatic stage (Latent phase) exists.
> *   **T** - **T**reatment is available and effective.
> *   **E** - **E**conomic (Cost-effective).
> *   **A** - **A**greed policy on whom to treat.

### Types of Screening

1.  **Mass Screening:** Screening the whole population (e.g., General health checkups). Not always useful if the disease prevalence is low.
2.  **High-Risk / Selective Screening:** Applied to specific groups known to be at high risk (e.g., Screening for Ca Cervix in women of lower SES, or HIV in sex workers). This is the most productive method.
3.  **Multiphasic Screening:** Application of two or more screening tests in combination to a large number of people at one time (e.g., Checking BP, Height/Weight, Urine sugar, and Vision all in one visit).

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Pap Smear:** Used for screening [[Cervical Cancer]]. It detects pre-cancerous lesions (Latent stage) which can be treated before becoming invasive cancer.
*   **Mammography:** Used for screening [[Breast Cancer]].
*   **PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen):** Used for screening Prostate Cancer.
*   **Blood Pressure:** Routine screening for Hypertension to prevent stroke/MI.
