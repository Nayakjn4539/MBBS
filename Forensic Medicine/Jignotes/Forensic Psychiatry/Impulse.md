# Impulse

### Definition
[[Impulse]] is a sudden and **irresistible force** compelling a person to the conscious performance of some action without motive or forethought. The individual retains the knowledge that the act is wrong, but is unable to resist the urge to perform it due to a failure of will/volition.

### Phases of Impulse
The psychological cycle of an impulse typically follows three stages:
1.  **Prodromal Phase:** A feeling of rising tension, anxiety, or restlessness before the act.
2.  **Execution Phase:** The sudden performance of the act.
3.  **Relief Phase:** A sense of gratification, relief, or release of tension immediately following the act. Guilt or regret may follow later.

### Characteristics of Impulsive Acts
*   **Sudden onset:** Occurs without warning.
*   **No Motive:** The act is purposeless in the criminal sense (e.g., stealing not for gain, but for the thrill).
*   **No Forethought/Planning:** There is no preparation or premeditation.
*   **No Accomplices:** Usually committed alone.
*   **No Attempt to Conceal:** The person does not try to hide the crime or escape immediately (though they might try to hide the result later upon regaining composure).
*   **Consciousness:** The sensorium is usually clear; the person is aware of what they are doing.
*   **Memory:** The memory of the act is usually preserved (unlike in [[Epileptic Automatism]]).

### Classification / Types of Morbid Impulses
These are often categorized under **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders** or **Impulse Control Disorders** in modern psychiatry.
