# [[Ear]] > Eustachian Tube Dysfunctions

### [[Eustachian Tube]] Dysfunctions

**Definition:** [[Eustachian tube]] dysfunction (ETD) refers to the failure of the tube to perform its physiological functions, primarily ventilation, protection, and clearance of the [[middle ear]]. This usually manifests as either failure to open (obstruction) or failure to close (patulous tube).

### Functional Anatomy and Physiology

The [[Eustachian tube]] connects the [[nasopharynx]] to the [[tympanic cavity]].
*   **Length:** Approximately 36 mm in adults (bony lateral 1/3, cartilaginous medial 2/3).
*   **Muscles involved:**
    *   **[[Tensor veli palatini]]:** The active dilator of the tube (opens it during swallowing/yawning).
    *   **[[Levator veli palatini]]:** Assists in opening.
    *   **[[Salpingopharyngeus]]:** Role is uncertain/minor.
*   **Ostmann’s Pad of Fat:** Fatty tissue lateral to the membranous tube that aids in keeping the tube closed (protecting from reflux).

**Physiological Functions (VP C):**
1.  **V**entilation: Regulation of [[middle ear]] pressure (equilibrating with atmospheric pressure).
2.  **P**rotection: Protects [[middle ear]] from nasopharyngeal sound pressure and reflux of secretions.
3.  **C**learance: Mucociliary drainage of secretions from [[middle ear]] to [[nasopharynx]].

**Table: Differences between Infant and Adult Eustachian Tube**

| Feature | Infant | Adult |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Length** | Short (~13–18 mm) | Long (~36 mm) |
| **Direction** | Horizontal (Angle ~10°) | Oblique/Angulated (Angle ~45°) |
| **Lumen** | Wider | Narrower |
| **Isthmus** | No angulation | Angulation present |
| **Cartilage** | Flaccid | Rigid |
| **Elastin** | Less dense (poor recoil) | More dense |
| **Ostmann’s Fat** | Less | More |
| **Clinical Implication** | Prone to reflux & **[[Acute Otitis Media]]** | Better protection |

### Etiology of Dysfunction

Dysfunction is broadly classified into **Obstruction** (most common) and **Abnormal Patency** (Patulous ET).

#### 1. Eustachian Tube Obstruction
Can be mechanical (intrinsic/extrinsic) or functional.

*   **Mechanical Obstruction:**
    *   **Intrinsic (Mucosal Edema):** [[Allergic rhinitis]], [[Sinusitis]], Upper respiratory tract infections (Viral/Bacterial), Smoking.
    *   **Extrinsic (Mass effect):** [[Adenoid hypertrophy]] (commonest in children), [[Nasopharyngeal carcinoma]], [[Nasal polyps]], Intra-nasal tumors.
*   **Functional Obstruction:**
    *   Collapse of the tube due to increased cartilage compliance.
    *   Poor function of [[Tensor veli palatini]] muscle.
    *   **Conditions:** [[Cleft palate]] (almost universal dysfunction), [[Down syndrome]].

#### 2. Patulous Eustachian Tube
The tube remains abnormally open, usually due to loss of the **Ostmann’s pad of fat**.
*   **Causes:** Rapid weight loss, Third trimester of pregnancy, Atrophic rhinitis, [[Multiple sclerosis]], Radiotherapy.

### Clinical Features

#### 1. Obstructive Dysfunction
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Aural fullness/blocked sensation.
    *   Mild [[Conductive Hearing Loss]].
    *   Popping sensation or [[Tinnitus]].
    *   Otalgia (due to negative pressure).
*   **Signs (Otoscopy):**
    *   **[[Retracted Tympanic Membrane]]:** Loss of light reflex, prominent lateral process of [[malleus]], foreshortened handle of malleus.
    *   **Middle Ear Effusion:** Air bubbles or fluid level behind TM (Amber color).
    *   **Mobility:** Restricted mobility on pneumatic otoscopy.

#### 2. Patulous Eustachian Tube
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **[[Autophony]]:** Patient hears their own voice loudly/echoing.
    *   **Amphoric breathing:** Patient hears their own breath sounds.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Otoscopy:** [[Tympanic membrane]] moves in and out synchronous with respiration. These movements are exaggerated if the patient breathes with the opposite nostril closed.

### Diagnostic Tests for Eustachian Tube Function

#### 1. Clinical Maneuvers

| Maneuver | Procedure | Mechanism | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Valsalva Maneuver]]** | Forced expiration with mouth closed and nose pinched. | Increases nasopharyngeal pressure (Positive pressure). | Otoscopy shows TM bulging outward if patent. |
| **[[Toynbee Maneuver]]** | Swallow while nose is pinched. | Creates negative nasopharyngeal pressure. | TM moves inward (retracts) if patent. Physiological test. |
| **[[Politzerization]]** | Air blown into one nostril via bag while patient swallows; other nostril closed. | Passive inflation of middle ear. | Hissing sound heard by examiner via auscultation tube if patent. |
| **[[Frenzel Maneuver]]** | Muscles of floor of mouth contracted with nose/mouth closed. | Ventilates middle ear. | Difficult to learn; used by pilots/divers. |

#### 2. Specialized Investigations

*   **[[Tympanometry]] (Impedance Audiometry):**
    *   Most reliable test. Assesses physiological function.
    *   **Type C curve:** Indicates negative middle ear pressure (Eustachian tube dysfunction).
    *   **Type B curve:** Indicates fluid in middle ear (GLUE ear) due to chronic obstruction.
    *   **Inflation-Deflation Test:** Assesses ability to equilibrate applied positive/negative pressures (+200/-200 mmH2O).
*   **[[Eustachian Tube Catheterization]]:**
    *   Curved metal cannula passed along nasal floor, rotated medial then lateral to engage the tubal opening. Air insufflated.
    *   **Whistling sound:** Stenosis.
    *   **Bubbling sound:** Fluid in middle ear.
    *   **No sound:** Complete block.
*   **Radiology:**
    *   **CT Scan:** To rule out [[Sinusitis]] or erosion.
    *   **MRI:** Essential in unilateral obstruction in adults to rule out [[Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma]].
*   **Sonotubometry:** Sound delivered to nose; microphone in ear canal records sound if tube opens.
*   **Saccharine/Methylene Blue Test:** Instilled in ear (if perforation present); time taken to taste sweet or see dye in throat assesses mucociliary clearance.

### Management

#### A. Obstructive Dysfunction

1.  **Treat the Cause:**
    *   **[[Adenoidectomy]]:** If adenoid hypertrophy is present.
    *   **Nasal Sprays:** Topical steroids/decongestants for rhinitis.
    *   **Antibiotics:** For sinusitis/URTI.
2.  **Middle Ear Aeration:**
    *   Valsalva maneuver (Auto-inflation).
    *   Otovent balloon (for children).
3.  **Surgical:**
    *   **[[Myringotomy]]:** Incision in TM to drain fluid/equalize pressure.
    *   **Grommet Insertion ([[Ventilation Tube]]):** Acts as an artificial Eustachian tube. Indicated for [[Otitis Media with Effusion]] persisting >3 months.
    *   **Balloon Tuboplasty:** Newer technique to dilate the cartilaginous part.

#### B. Patulous Dysfunction

1.  **Reassurance:** Condition is often self-limiting.
2.  **Weight Gain:** If due to weight loss.
3.  **Medical:** Oral Potassium Iodide (SSKI) – increases mucosal secretions/edema to narrow the tube.
4.  **Surgical:**
    *   Injection of Teflon/filler into the anterior lip of the ET orifice.
    *   Cauterization of the orifice (chemical/diathermy) to induce scarring.
    *   Grommet insertion (to dampen TM movements).

### Sequelae of Chronic Obstruction (The "Cascade")

If the [[Eustachian tube]] remains blocked:
1.  Absorption of Middle Ear gases ($O_2$, $N_2$).
2.  Negative Intratympanic Pressure.
3.  **[[Otitis Media with Effusion]] (Glue Ear):** Transudation of fluid.
4.  **Atelectasis:** Thinning and retraction of TM.
5.  **[[Retraction Pockets]]:** Specifically in Pars Flaccida or Posterosuperior quadrant.
6.  **[[Cholesteatoma]]:** Accumulation of keratin debris in deep retraction pockets (Primary Acquired).
7.  **Ossicular Necrosis:** Erosion of Incus (Long process) due to pressure/contact.

**Clinical Implication:** Unilateral [[Serous Otitis Media]] (fluid in ear) in an adult is **[[Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma]]** until proven otherwise!.
