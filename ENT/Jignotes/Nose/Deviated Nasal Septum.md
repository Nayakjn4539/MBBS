# [[Nose]] > Deviated Nasal Septum

### [[Deviated Nasal Septum]] (DNS)

**Definition**
A deviation of the cartilaginous and/or bony framework of the [[nasal septum]] from the midline. While up to 80% of the population may have some degree of deviation, it is considered a disease entity only when it produces mechanical nasal obstruction or symptoms,.

### Etiology
The causation of DNS is multifactorial:

1.  **Trauma**
    *   **Birth Trauma:** Common cause. Occurs during passage through the birth canal (forceps delivery or face presentation),.
    *   **Childhood/Adult Trauma:**
        *   **Lateral blow:** Displaces [[septal cartilage]] from the [[vomerine groove]] and maxillary crest,.
        *   **Frontal blow:** Causes buckling, crushing, or telescoping of fragments.
        *   *Note:* Microfractures in childhood may go unnoticed but manifest as DNS during pubertal growth.

2.  **Developmental Errors**
    *   The [[nasal septum]] (tectoseptal process) descends to meet the palate. If the septum grows faster than the surrounding frame (base of skull and palate), it buckles to accommodate itself,,.
    *   **High Arched Palate:** Seen in mouth breathers (e.g., [[adenoid hypertrophy]]). The palate rises, reducing vertical space for the septum, causing it to deviate,,.
    *   **Cleft Lip/Palate:** Often associated with severe septal deformities,.

3.  **Racial and Hereditary Factors**
    *   More common in Caucasians than African Americans.
    *   Often runs in families.

### Types of Septal Deviation
Deviations may involve cartilage, bone, or both.

| Type | Description | Clinical Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Anterior Dislocation** | The [[septal cartilage]] dislocates from the [[anterior nasal spine]] or maxillary crest into one nasal chamber,. | Visible as a projection in the vestibule (Caudal dislocation). |
| **C-Shaped** | Simple curve to one side. | Causes **unilateral** nasal obstruction. The concave (roomier) side often develops compensatory [[hypertrophy]] of the [[inferior turbinate]]. |
| **S-Shaped** | Deviation in an S-curve (vertical or anteroposterior plane). | Causes **bilateral** nasal obstruction. |
| **[[Septal Spur]]** | Shelf-like projection at the bony-cartilaginous junction (vomer/ethmoid and cartilage),. | Can press on the lateral nasal wall causing headache or epistaxis. |
| **Thickening** | Localized thickness due to overriding fragments or organized hematoma. | Contributes to obstruction. |

### Clinical Features
Patients may be asymptomatic. Symptomatic DNS presents with:

1.  **Nasal Obstruction:**
    *   Most common symptom.
    *   Can be unilateral (C-shaped) or bilateral (S-shaped).
    *   **Paradoxical Nasal Obstruction:** Patient complains of blockage on the side *opposite* to the deviation (the concave side) due to compensatory hypertrophy of the [[inferior turbinate]],.

2.  **Headache:**
    *   **Anterior Ethmoidal Nerve Syndrome (Sluder’s Neuralgia):** Caused by a septal spur pressing on the lateral nasal wall (middle turbinate), stimulating the [[anterior ethmoidal nerve]],.
    *   Sinusitis-related vacuum headache.

3.  **Epistaxis:**
    *   Mucosa over the deviated part (convexity/spur) is exposed to drying air currents $\rightarrow$ crusting $\rightarrow$ bleeding upon removal,.
    *   Vessels over a spur are stretched and prone to rupture.

4.  **Sinusitis:**
    *   DNS may obstruct the [[ostiomeatal complex]], impairing drainage and ventilation,.

5.  **Anosmia/Hyposmia:**
    *   Obstruction prevents air from reaching the olfactory cleft,.

6.  **External Deformity:**
    *   Deviation of the cartilaginous dorsum or tip.

7.  **Middle Ear Infection:**
    *   Predisposes to Recurrent Acute Otitis Media ([[AOM]]) via [[Eustachian tube]] dysfunction,.

### Clinical Examination

*   **Anterior Rhinoscopy:**
    *   Visualize the type of deviation (C-shaped, S-shaped, Spur).
    *   Assess for caudal dislocation (elevate the tip of the nose).
    *   Check for compensatory turbinate hypertrophy.
*   **Cottle’s Test:**
    *   **Method:** The cheek is pulled laterally to open the nasal valve angle while the patient breathes,.
    *   **Interpretation:** Improvement in airflow indicates obstruction at the [[nasal valve]] area (Positive test),.
*   **Cold Spatula Test:**
    *   Unequal misting on a cold metal tongue depressor indicates obstruction,.
*   **Diagnostic Nasal Endoscopy ([[DNE]]):**
    *   Confirmatory. Evaluates posterior deviations, spurs, and the status of the [[ostiomeatal complex]],.

### Complications of Untreated DNS
1.  **Recurrent [[Rhinosinusitis]]**.
2.  **Middle Ear Infections** (RAOM).
3.  **Mouth Breathing:** Leads to pharyngitis, laryngitis, and bronchitis.
4.  **Atrophic Rhinitis:** May develop on the wider (concave) side due to drying effects,.
5.  **Asthma:** DNS may act as a trigger.
6.  **Sleep Apnea:** Contributes to obstructive sleep apnea.

### Management

**Medical:**
*   Treat associated rhinitis or sinusitis.
*   Asymptomatic mild deviations require **no treatment**.

**Surgical:**
indicated for persistent symptoms (obstruction, headache, epistaxis) or as access for other surgeries (e.g., FESS, Hypophysectomy),.

#### Comparison of Surgical Techniques

| Feature | [[Submucous Resection]] (SMR) | [[Septoplasty]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nature** | Radical/Resective procedure,. | Conservative/Reconstructive procedure,. |
| **Age Limit** | **> 17 years** (interferes with facial growth),. | Can be done in children (if severe obstruction),. |
| **Incision** | **Killian’s incision** (mucosa cephalic to caudal end),. | **Freer’s incision** (hemitransfixion at caudal border),. |
| **Flap Elevation** | Mucoperichondrial flaps raised on **both sides**,. | Flap raised on **one side** (usually concave); limited elevation on other side,. |
| **Cartilage Removal** | Extensive removal of bony and cartilaginous septum. **L-strut** (dorsal and caudal strip) preserved,. | Minimal resection. Only the most deviated part is removed; rest is repositioned/corrected,. |
| **Complications** | Higher risk of: **Supratip depression** (saddle nose), **Septal perforation**, Flapping septum,. | Fewer complications. Preferred surgery. |

**Clinical Implication - Septal Hematoma:**
Post-trauma or post-surgery, blood may collect under the perichondrium (bilateral boggy swelling). It must be drained within **72 hours** to prevent **septal abscess** and cartilage necrosis, which leads to **[[saddle nose]] deformity**,.
