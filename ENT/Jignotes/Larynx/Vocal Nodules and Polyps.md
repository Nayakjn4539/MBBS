# [[Larynx]] > Vocal Nodules and Polyps

# [[Vocal Nodules]] (Singer's Nodes / Screamer's Nodes)

[[Vocal nodules]] are the most common benign lesions of the vocal folds, typically resulting from chronic phonotrauma. They are essentially localized areas of chronic inflammation and epithelial hyperplasia.

### Aetiology and Risk Factors
*   **Chronic Vocal Abuse:** Persistent use of voice in an unnatural range, high intensity, or for prolonged periods.
    *   Common in teachers, pop/rock singers, vendors, hawkers, and stock traders.
    *   **Children:** Known as "screamer's nodules," often seen in assertive, talkative boys.
*   **Aggravating Factors:**
    *   [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD) / Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR).
    *   Upper respiratory infections.
    *   Allergy.
    *   Insufficient fluid intake/dehydration.

### Pathology
*   **Site:** Located at the **junction of the anterior 1/3 and posterior 2/3** of the membranous [[vocal cord]].
    *   *Reason:* This is the point of maximum vibratory amplitude and mechanical impact during phonation.
*   **Nature:** Usually **bilateral** and symmetrical.
*   **Progression:**
    1.  **Early Stage:** Soft, reddish, edematous, vascular swellings due to submucosal hemorrhage and edema.
    2.  **Late/Mature Stage:** Greyish or white, firm, fibrotic nodules due to hyalinization and epithelial hyperplasia.

### Clinical Features
*   **Hoarseness:** Chronic or recurrent, often worse in the evenings (vocal fatigue).
*   **Voice Quality:** Breathiness (due to incomplete glottic closure), roughness, and harshness.
*   **Pitch:** Breaking of voice at higher ranges; inability to sing soft high notes.
*   **Pain:** Neck pain may occur on prolonged phonation due to muscle tension.

### Management
**1. Conservative Management (First Line):**
*   **Voice Rest:** Essential for early, soft nodules which may resolve completely.
*   **[[Speech therapy]]:** Re-education on proper voice production to prevent recurrence. This is the mainstay of treatment.
*   **Medical Therapy:** Treat aggravating factors like [[Laryngopharyngeal reflux]] (PPIs), allergies, and ensure hydration.

**2. Surgical Management:**
*   **Indication:** Large, fibrotic nodules or those refractory to speech therapy.
*   **Procedure:** **Microlaryngeal Surgery ([[MLS]])**. Precise excision under an operating microscope.
    *   *Caution:* Avoid damage to the [[vocal ligament]] to prevent scarring. Lasers are generally avoided for nodules to prevent thermal damage to the vibratory edge.
*   **Post-operative:** Strict voice rest (approx. 48 hours to 4 days) followed by speech therapy,.

# [[Vocal Polyps]]

A [[vocal polyp]] is a benign, usually solitary lesion arising from the vocal fold mucosa. It is the most common structural abnormality causing hoarseness in adult males.

### Aetiology
*   **Sudden Vocal Trauma:** Often results from a single episode of severe vocal abuse (e.g., shouting at a sports event) leading to shearing force and capillary rupture.
*   **Risk Factors:** Smoking, allergens, and blood thinners (aspirin/anticoagulants).

### Pathology
*   **Site:** Free edge of the vocal cord at the junction of the **anterior 1/3 and posterior 2/3** (same as nodules) or the [[anterior commissure]].
*   **Nature:** Usually **unilateral**.
*   **Histology:** Edema and hemorrhage in the [[Reinke's space]] (superficial lamina propria) with hyaline degeneration.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Pedunculated:** Has a stalk; may flop in and out of the glottis.
    *   **Sessile:** Broad-based.
    *   **Hemorrhagic vs. Gelatinous:** Depending on vascularity and stromal content.

### Clinical Features
*   **Hoarseness:** The predominant symptom.
*   **Diplophonia:** Production of "double voice" because the two vocal cords vibrate at different frequencies due to the unilateral mass loading.
*   **Respiratory Distress:** A large pedunculated polyp may fall into the glottis during inspiration, causing intermittent choking or stridor.
*   **Sensation:** Feeling of a foreign body in the throat; constant throat clearing.

### Management
*   **Surgical Management (Mainstay):** Unlike nodules, established polyps rarely regress with therapy alone.
    *   **Procedure:** **Microlaryngeal Surgery ([[MLS]])**. Excision using micro-instruments (cold steel) or CO2 laser.
    *   *Technique:* Microflap technique is often used to preserve the mucosa.
*   **Speech Therapy:** Pre- and post-operative therapy to correct faulty vocal habits.

# Comparison: Vocal Nodules vs. Vocal Polyps

| Feature | Vocal Nodules | Vocal Polyps |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Etiology** | Chronic/Prolonged vocal abuse | Sudden/Acute vocal trauma (shouting) |
| **Laterality** | **Bilateral** and Symmetrical | Usually **Unilateral** |
| **Appearance** | Sessile, grayish/white (mature) | Pedunculated or Sessile, red/translucent |
| **Site** | Junction of Ant 1/3 & Post 2/3 | Junction of Ant 1/3 & Post 2/3 |
| **Gender** | Females > Males (also children) | Males > Females (middle-aged) |
| **Voice Symptom** | Hoarseness, Breathiness | Hoarseness, **Diplophonia** |
| **Treatment** | **Speech Therapy** (Surgery if refractory) | **Surgery (MLS)** (Speech therapy adjunct) |

# Diagnosis (Common for Both)

*   **Indirect Laryngoscopy ([[IDL]]):** Initial screening. Nodules appear as pinhead swellings; polyps as smooth, soft masses.
*   **Flexible Fiberoptic Laryngoscopy:** Useful for patients with a strong gag reflex or difficult anatomy.
*   **[[Videostroboscopy]]:** The **gold standard** for diagnosis. It allows visualization of the mucosal wave, glottic closure pattern, and differentiation between cysts, nodules, and polyps.
    *   *Finding:* Nodules cause an "hourglass" glottic closure pattern.

### Clinical Implications
*   **[[Reinke's Edema]]:** Often confused with polyps. It is a *bilateral*, diffuse polypoid degeneration of the whole vocal cord, strongly associated with **smoking** and hypothyroidism.
*   **Professional Voice Users:** Surgery for nodules/polyps carries a risk of scarring which can permanently alter the singing voice. Conservative management is pushed aggressively first for nodules.

### Mnemonic
**Nodules are Neighbors** (Bilateral).
**Polyps are Private** (Unilateral).

**Location Rule:**
The **Meeting Point**: Where the Anterior 1/3 meets the Posterior 2/3 (Maximum vibration zone).
