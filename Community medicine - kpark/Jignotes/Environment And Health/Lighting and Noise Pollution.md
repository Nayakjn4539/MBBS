# LIGHTING

Good lighting is essential for efficient vision. Poor lighting causes eye strain, fatigue, and loss of efficiency.

### Requirements of Good Lighting
To ensure visual efficiency and comfort, the following factors are essential:
1.  **Sufficiency:** An illumination of **15 to 20 [[foot candles]]** is the basic minimum for satisfactory vision.
2.  **Distribution:** Uniform distribution without contrast differences to prevent eye strain.
3.  **Absence of [[Glare]]:** Glare is excessive contrast (e.g., automobile headlights at night). It causes acute discomfort and reduces critical vision.
4.  **Absence of Sharp Shadows:** Sharp shadows cause confusion to the eye.
5.  **Steadiness:** The light source must be constant; flickering causes eye strain and accidents.
6.  **Colour:** Artificial light should approximate daylight colour.
7.  **Surroundings:** Ceilings/Roofs should have a **reflection factor** of 80%; Walls 50-60%; Furniture 30-40%.

### Measurement of Light
There are four specific measures of importance in lighting:

| Quantity Measured | Description | Unit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Luminous Intensity** | Power of a light source (point source) | [[Candela]] |
| **Luminous Flux** | Flow of light related to a unit of solid angle | [[Lumen]] |
| **Illumination** | Amount of light reaching a surface | [[Lux]] (Lumens/m²) |
| **Brightness/Luminance** | Amount of light re-emitted/reflected by a surface | [[Lambert]] |

> **Mnemonic for Units:**
> *   **C**andle power = **C**andela (Intensity)
> *   **F**lux = **L**umen (**F**low of **L**ight)
> *   **I**llumination = **L**ux (**I** looks like **L**)
> *   **B**rightness = **L**ambert (**B**rghtness **L**evels)

### Daylight Factor (D.F.)
Since natural light varies, it is measured by the **Daylight Factor**.
*   **Definition:** Ratio of instantaneous illumination indoors to simultaneously occurring illumination outdoors (excluding direct sunlight).
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Living Rooms: **[[> 8%]]**
    *   Kitchens: **[[> 10%]]**

### Biological Effects of Light
Apart from vision, light influences:
*   **Biological Rhythms:** Body temperature and physical activity.
*   **Vitamin D Synthesis:** Activation of precursors of [[Vitamin D]].
*   **Melanin Synthesis:** Stimulation of melanin.
*   **Bilirubin Degradation:** Used therapeutically in neonates with hyperbilirubinemia.

# NOISE POLLUTION

**Definition:** Noise is defined as "wrong sound, in the wrong place, at the wrong time" or simply "unwanted sound".

### Properties of Noise
1.  **Loudness (Intensity):** Depends on the amplitude of vibrations. Measured in **[[Decibels (dB)]]**.
2.  **Frequency (Pitch):** Denoted as **[[Hertz (Hz)]]**. Human ear hears 20-20,000 Hz.

### Acceptable Noise Levels
*   **Residential (Bedroom):** 25 dB
*   **Residential (Living room):** 40 dB
*   **Hospital Wards:** 20-35 dB
*   **Industrial:** 40-60 dB

### Critical Sound Levels (Clinical Relevance)
| Sound Type | Intensity (dB) | Relevance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Whisper | 20-30 | Quiet |
| Normal Conversation | 60-70 | Standard |
| **Maximum Tolerable** | **85** | Limit without substantial hearing damage |
| Auditory Fatigue | 90 | Greatest at 4000 Hz |
| Mechanical Damage | 150-160 | E.g., Jet take-off (Tympanic membrane rupture) |

### Effects of Noise Exposure
**1. Auditory Effects**
*   **Auditory Fatigue:** Appears in the **90 dB** region, greatest at **4000 Hz**. Associated with whistling/buzzing in ears.
*   **Deafness (Hearing Loss):**
    *   *Temporary Threshold Shift:* Disability disappears within 24 hours. Occurs in 4000-6000 Hz range.
    *   *Permanent Threshold Shift:* Repeated exposure to noise around 100 dB. Results in destruction of the **[[Organs of Corti]]**.
    *   **Occupational Hearing Loss:** Characteristically shows a dip in the audiogram at **4000 Hz**.

**2. Non-Auditory Effects**
*   **Interference with speech:** Mainly in 300-500 Hz range.
*   **Annoyance:** Psychological response; neurotic people are more sensitive.
*   **Physiological Changes:** Rise in [[Blood Pressure]], rise in intracranial pressure, increased heart rate, sweating.
*   **Efficiency:** Reduction in work output and mental concentration.

### Control of Noise
1.  **Cities Planning:** Separation of industrial/transport zones from residential areas; creation of **[[Green Belts]]** (trees and shrubs absorb noise).
2.  **Control of Vehicles:** Restriction on heavy vehicles in narrow streets; prohibition of pressure horns.
3.  **Acoustic Insulation:** Detached buildings; sound-proofing.
4.  **Industries:** Enclosing noise-producing machinery; maintenance.
5.  **Protection of Exposed Persons:**
    *   **Hearing Protection:** [[Ear plugs]] or ear muffs for exposure >85 dB.
    *   **Rotation:** Rotating workers to quiet posts.
    *   **Monitoring:** Periodic **audiograms**.
6.  **Legislation:** Noise Abatement Acts; Workers' compensation for hearing loss.
