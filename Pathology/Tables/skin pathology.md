| Disease Name+definition | Etiology | Risk factors | Pathogenesis and stages | Genes and mutations involved | Gross Morphology | Microscopic features+special stains+identification | Clinical Manifestations | Diagnostic markers | Classification of types if any | Complications or associated disorders | Treatment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Dysplastic Nevi** Atypical moles that can be direct precursors to melanoma and serve as markers for increased melanoma risk. | - | Individuals with **dysplastic nevus syndrome** (familial atypical mole and melanoma syndrome) have a high risk. | Morphologic changes occur with stepwise acquisition of oncogenic mutations and epigenetic changes. RAS or BRAF activation coupled with loss of cell cycle control (e.g., loss of p16) contributes to development. Progression stages: **(1)** Lentiginous melanocytic hyperplasia -> **(2)** Lentiginous junctional nevus -> **(3)** Lentiginous compound nevus with atypia (dysplastic nevus) -> **(4)** Early melanoma. | Acquired activating mutations in **NRAS** and **BRAF** genes.  Inherited loss-of-function mutations in **CDKN2A** (encodes p16). Mutations in **CDK4** gene making it resistant to p16 inhibition. | Larger than acquired nevi (often >5 mm). May be flat macules, slightly raised plaques with a "pebbly" surface, or target-like lesions. Variegated pigmentation and irregular borders. Occur on sun-exposed and protected surfaces. | Involve epidermis and dermis. **Architectural atypia**: Enlarged, coalescing epidermal nests; single nevus cells replace the basal layer (**lentiginous hyperplasia**). **Cytologic atypia**: Nuclear enlargement, irregular/angulated nuclear contours, hyperchromasia. Associated findings: lymphocytic infiltrates, melanin incontinence, linear (lamellar) fibrosis. | The vast majority are clinically stable and never progress. In dysplastic nevus syndrome, individuals may develop hundreds of nevi. | Best viewed as indicators of increased melanoma risk rather than premalignant lesions. | - | Direct precursor to melanoma. Probability of developing melanoma is over 50% by age 60 in individuals with dysplastic nevus syndrome. | - |
| **Melanoma** The most deadly skin cancer, a neoplasm of melanocytes, strongly linked to mutations caused by UV radiation. | Exposure to UV radiation from sunlight. | Inherited genetic risk (10-15% of cases). Lightly pigmented individuals (fair-skinned). Periodic, severe sunburns early in life. Multiple dysplastic nevi. | **Pathogenesis:** driven by mutations affecting cell cycle control, pro-growth pathways, and telomerase. UV radiation causes DNA damage, leading to mutation accumulation.  **Stages:** **1. Radial Growth Phase:** Horizontal spread within the epidermis and superficial dermis. Lacks metastatic capacity. Includes subtypes like lentigo maligna, superficial spreading, and acral/mucosal lentiginous melanoma. **2. Vertical Growth Phase:** Tumor cells invade downward into the deep dermis as an expansile mass. Heralded by a nodule, it signifies the emergence of a subclone with metastatic potential. Lacks maturation/neurotization seen in benign nevi. | **Cell Cycle Control:** • **CDKN2A**: Mutated in 40% of familial cases and also in sporadic cases. Loss of its products (**p16**, **ARF**) disrupts RB and p53 pathways. **Pro-Growth Pathways:** • **BRAF**: Activating mutations in 40-50% of melanomas. • **NRAS**: Activating mutations in 15-20%. • **PTEN**: Tumor suppressor loss, often in BRAF-mutated tumors, heightens PI3K/AKT signaling. • **KIT**: Activating mutations in melanomas on non-sun-exposed sites. • **NF1**: Loss-of-function mutations. **Telomerase Activation:** • **TERT**: Promoter mutations in ~70% of tumors, increasing TERT expression and preventing senescence. | Striking variations in color (black, brown, red, dark blue, gray). Irregular and often notched borders. Appearance of a nodule often signifies vertical growth. | Cells are larger than normal melanocytes, with enlarged nuclei, irregular contours, clumped chromatin, and prominent red (eosinophilic) nucleoli. **Radial growth:** single cells and irregular nests in epidermis. **Vertical growth:** nodular aggregates of infiltrating cells in dermis. **Special Stains:** HMB-45 can identify melanoma cells in sentinel lymph nodes. | Usually asymptomatic; itching or pain can be early signs. Most are >10mm at diagnosis. Warning signs (**ABCDEs**): **A**symmetry, irregular **B**orders, variegated **C**olor, increasing **D**iameter, **E**volution or change over time. | Prognostic pathologic variables: **(1) Breslow thickness** (tumor depth), **(2)** Number of mitoses, **(3)** Evidence of tumor regression, **(4)** Ulceration, **(5)** Presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, **(6)** Location. Microscopic involvement of a sentinel lymph node confers a worse prognosis. | **Radial Growth Phase Types:** • **Lentigo maligna** • **Superficial spreading** (most common) • **Acral/mucosal lentiginous** | Metastasis to regional lymph nodes and distant sites. | Surgical excision. Targeted therapies (e.g., BRAF inhibitors for tumors with BRAF mutations). Immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-CTLA4, anti-PD1). |
| **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** The second most common tumor on sun-exposed sites, arising from keratinocytes. | DNA damage induced by UV light is the most important cause. | Chronic immunosuppression (e.g., transplant patients). Industrial carcinogens (tars, oils). Chronic ulcers, draining osteomyelitis. Old burn scars. Ingestion of arsenicals. Ionizing radiation. Tobacco and betel nut chewing (oral cavity). Infection with HPV subtypes 5 and 8 in immunosuppressed patients. | Dysfunction of p53 is an early event, often caused by UV-induced mutations. Loss of p53's protective functions (cell cycle arrest, DNA repair) allows damaged cells to proliferate. Additional driver mutations that increase RAS signaling and decrease Notch signaling also contribute to transformation. It can arise from precursor lesions called actinic keratoses. | **TP53**: High incidence of mutations in precursor actinic keratoses, often at pyrimidine dimers, indicating UV damage. Mutations that increase **RAS** signaling. Mutations that decrease **Notch** signaling. | **In situ carcinoma:** Sharply defined, red, scaling plaques. **Invasive lesions:** Nodular, show variable keratin production (hyperkeratotic scale), and may ulcerate. | **In situ:** Atypical (enlarged, hyperchromatic) nuclei involve all levels of the epidermis. **Invasive:** Shows variable differentiation. Well-differentiated tumors have polygonal cells in orderly lobules with large areas of keratinization. Poorly differentiated tumors consist of anaplastic cells with only single-cell keratinization (**dyskeratosis**). **Stains:** Immunohistochemical stains for keratins confirm diagnosis in poorly differentiated tumors. | - | - | - | Metastasizes to regional nodes in <5% of cases, typically deeply invasive lesions. More aggressive at mucosal sites. | Local excision. |
| **Basal Cell Carcinoma** The most common invasive cancer in humans. A distinctive, locally aggressive cutaneous tumor associated with mutations that activate the Hedgehog signaling pathway. | Associated with sun exposure. | Lightly pigmented elderly adults. Immunosuppression. Disorders of DNA repair (e.g., xeroderma pigmentosum). **Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS or Gorlin syndrome)**. | Most cases have mutations leading to unbridled **Hedgehog signaling**. Normally, the PTCH receptor binds and inhibits SMO. In the presence of the Sonic hedgehog (SHH) ligand, SMO is released, activating transcription factor GLI1. Loss-of-function mutations in PTCH (or activating mutations in SMO) cause constitutive activation of SMO and GLI1, leading to tumor growth. One-third of mutations in sporadic cases are C->T transitions, a hallmark of UV damage. | Germline loss-of-function mutation in one **PTCH** allele in Gorlin syndrome. Sporadic tumors also have mutations that inactivate **PTCH** or, less commonly, activate **SMO**. | Pearly papules containing prominent dilated subepidermal blood vessels (**telangiectasias**). Some may be pigmented. Advanced lesions may ulcerate ("rodent ulcers"). The superficial variant presents as an erythematous, sometimes pigmented plaque. | Tumor cells resemble the normal basal cell layer of the epidermis. Arise from epidermis or follicles. **Nodular lesions:** Cords and islands of variably basophilic cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, embedded in a mucinous matrix. Cells at the periphery are arranged radially with their long axes in parallel (**palisading**). Stroma often retracts from the carcinoma, creating characteristic **clefts** or separation artifacts. | Slow-growing tumors. Arise on sun-exposed sites. In Gorlin syndrome, multiple BCCs develop, often before age 20. | - | **Multifocal growths** (superficial type) **Nodular lesions** | Locally aggressive and potentially disfiguring. Extensive local invasion of bone or facial sinuses may occur with neglect. Metastasis is very rare (<0.5%). Associated with medulloblastoma, ovarian fibromas in Gorlin syndrome. | Local excision. Small molecule inhibitors of the Hedgehog pathway for unresectable cases. |
| **Mycosis Fungoides (Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma)** A lymphoma of skin-homing CD4+ T-helper cells that presents in the skin. | Neoplastic proliferation of skin-homing CD4+ T-helper cells. | Most commonly afflicts persons older than age 40. | The proliferating cells are clonal populations of CD4+ T-helper cells expressing cutaneous lymphocyte antigen, which directs them to the skin. The disease often remains localized to the skin for years but can evolve into a systemic lymphoma. Stages include: **(1) Patch stage:** scaly, red-brown patches. **(2) Plaque stage:** raised, scaling plaques. **(3) Nodule stage:** fungating nodules. | A wide variety of driver gene mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes have been described; none appear to be specific for CTCL. Neoplastic cells have clonal T-cell receptor gene rearrangements. | Lesions involve truncal areas. Appear as scaly, red-brown patches; raised, scaling plaques; or fungating nodules. Plaques and nodules may ulcerate. | Histologic hallmark is the presence of atypical T-cells (**Sézary-Lutzner cells**) that form band-like aggregates in the superficial dermis and invade the epidermis as single cells and small clusters (**Pautrier microabscesses**). These cells have markedly infolded nuclear membranes, imparting a convoluted or **cerebriform** contour. This epidermal infiltration is called **epidermotropism**. | Eczema-like lesions in early stages. Later, indurated, erythematous plaques and tumor nodules develop. | - | - | May evolve into a systemic lymphoma. Seeding of the blood by malignant T cells accompanied by diffuse erythema and scaling of the entire body (erythroderma) is known as **Sézary syndrome**. | Topical therapy with steroids or UV light for early lesions. Aggressive systemic chemotherapy for advanced disease. |
| **Ichthyosis** A group of inherited disorders associated with chronic, excessive keratin buildup (hyperkeratosis) that results in fish-like scaliness. | Inherited genetic defects impairing epidermal maturation. Acquired variants also exist. | - | The primary abnormality is **defective desquamation**, leading to retention of abnormally formed scales. In X-linked ichthyosis, a deficiency of steroid sulfatase leads to accumulation of proadhesive cholesterol sulfate, causing persistent cell-to-cell adhesion in the stratum corneum and failure of desquamation. | Deficiency of **steroid sulfatase** enzyme in X-linked ichthyosis. | Prominent fish-like scales. | Buildup of compacted stratum corneum with loss of the normal basket-weave pattern. Generally little or no inflammation. Variations in thickness of epidermis and stratum granulosum are used to subclassify. | Most forms become apparent at or around the time of birth. | - | • Ichthyosis vulgaris (autosomal dominant or acquired) • Congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (autosomal recessive) • Lamellar ichthyosis (autosomal recessive) • X-linked ichthyosis | Acquired ichthyosis vulgaris may be associated with lymphoid and visceral malignancies. | - |
| **Urticaria** Hives; a common disorder caused by localized mast cell degranulation and associated dermal microvascular hyperpermeability. | Antigen-induced release of vasoactive mediators from mast cells. | Occurs most often between ages 20 and 40. Any area exposed to pressure. | Results from antigen-induced mast cell degranulation. IgE-dependent urticaria is a localized **type I hypersensitivity reaction**, where antigens (pollens, foods, drugs) bind to IgE on mast cells, triggering degranulation. IgE-independent urticaria can be caused by substances that directly incite mast cell degranulation (opiates, contrast media) or by aspirin. | In hereditary angioneurotic edema, there is an inherited deficiency of **C1 inhibitor**. | Pruritic, edematous plaques called **wheals**. Small pruritic papules to large edematous plaques. May coalesce to form annular, linear, or arciform configurations. | Sparse superficial perivenular infiltrate of mononuclear cells, rare neutrophils, and sometimes eosinophils. Collagen bundles are widely spaced due to **dermal edema**. Dilated dermal lymphatic channels. No changes in the epidermis. | Individual lesions develop and fade within hours (usually <24 hours). Episodes can last for days or months. | - | • **Mast cell–dependent, IgE-dependent** • **Mast cell–dependent, IgE-independent** • **Mast cell–independent, IgE-independent** (e.g., aspirin-induced, hereditary angioneurotic edema) | Persistent episodes may herald underlying disease (e.g., collagen vascular disorders, Hodgkin lymphoma). Angioedema (edema of deeper dermis and subcutaneous fat) is closely related. | - |
| **Acute Eczematous Dermatitis** A common skin disorder, also known as eczema, resulting from T cell–mediated inflammatory reactions. | Contact with antigens (e.g., urushiol from poison ivy), ingested drugs, or certain foods. | - | Typically results from T cell–mediated (**type IV**) hypersensitivity. Chemicals (**haptens**) on the skin react with self-proteins, creating neoantigens. These are taken up by **Langerhans cells** and presented to naive CD4+ T cells in lymph nodes. On re-exposure, memory T cells migrate to the skin and release cytokines, recruiting more inflammatory cells. This process occurs within 24 hours. Chronic UV light exposure can inhibit this process by injuring Langerhans cells. | - | Red, papulovesicular, crusted lesions. If persistent, they develop reactive acanthosis and hyperkeratosis, appearing as raised scaling plaques. Acute reactions (e.g., poison ivy) feature pruritic, edematous, oozing plaques, often with vesicles and bullae. | **Spongiosis** (intercellular edema of the epidermis) is the histologic hallmark. Edema splays apart keratinocytes, and shearing of desmosomes can form intraepidermal vesicles. Earliest stages show a superficial, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with papillary dermal edema and mast cell degranulation. The infiltrate composition can provide clues (e.g., eosinophils in drug-related eczema). | - | - | • Allergic contact dermatitis • Atopic dermatitis • Drug-related eczematous dermatitis • Photoeczematous dermatitis • Primary irritant dermatitis | Bacterial superinfection can produce a yellow crust (**impetiginization**). | Removal of offending agent. Topical steroids can block the inflammatory response. |
| **Erythema Multiforme** An uncommon, self-limited hypersensitivity reaction characterized by keratinocyte injury. | Associated with: infections (herpes simplex, mycoplasma), drugs (sulfonamides, penicillin), cancer (carcinomas, lymphomas), and collagen vascular diseases. | - | Characterized by keratinocyte injury mediated by skin-homing **CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes**. CD8+ T cells are prominent in the central portion of lesions, while CD4+ helper T cells and Langerhans cells are more prevalent peripherally. The epidermal antigens recognized by the T cells are unknown. | - | Diverse array of lesions including macules, papules, vesicles, bullae, and characteristic **targetoid (target-like) lesions**, which have a central blister or zone of necrosis surrounded by macular erythema. | Shows a superficial perivascular, lymphocytic infiltrate with dermal edema and accumulation of lymphocytes along the dermoepidermal junction. This pattern of inflammation with degenerating and necrotic keratinocytes is termed **interface dermatitis**. With time, lymphocytes migrate into the epidermis, and confluent zones of epidermal necrosis occur with blister formation. | Can affect individuals of any age. Symmetric involvement of the extremities is common in limited cases. | - | - | **Stevens-Johnson syndrome**: A febrile form with extensive skin involvement, often in children, affecting skin, lips, oral mucosa, conjunctiva, urethra, and genital/perianal areas. **Toxic epidermal necrolysis**: Characterized by diffuse necrosis and sloughing of cutaneous and mucosal surfaces. Both can lead to life-threatening sepsis. | - |
| **Psoriasis** A common, chronic inflammatory dermatosis that appears to have an autoimmune basis. | Autoimmune. | Genetic factors (particular HLA gene variants). Local trauma can induce lesions in susceptible individuals (**Koebner phenomenon**). | Sensitized populations of CD4+ Th1 and Th17 cells, and activated CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, enter the skin. These cells create a cytokine "soup" (IL-12, IFN-γ, TNF, IL-17) and secrete growth factors that induce keratinocyte proliferation, resulting in the characteristic lesions. Trauma is thought to set in motion a local inflammatory response that becomes self-perpetuating. | Associated with particular **HLA** gene variants. | Affects elbows, knees, scalp, lumbosacral areas, intergluteal cleft, glans penis. Typical lesion is a well-demarcated, pink to salmon-colored plaque covered by loosely adherent silver-white scale. Nail changes (yellow-brown discoloration, pitting, onycholysis) occur in 30% of cases. | Marked epidermal thickening (**acanthosis**) with regular downward elongation of rete ridges ("test tubes in a rack"). Stratum granulosum is thinned or absent, with extensive overlying **parakeratosis**. Thinning of the epidermal layer over dermal papillae tips (suprapapillary plates). Dilated, tortuous blood vessels in papillae. Neutrophil aggregates in the superficial epidermis (**spongiform pustules**) and in the parakeratotic stratum corneum (**Munro microabscesses**). | Lifting the scale leads to multiple, minute, bleeding points (**Auspitz sign**). | - | - | Associated arthritis (in 15% of patients), myopathy, enteropathy, and AIDS. | TNF inhibitors show excellent clinical responses. |
| **Seborrheic Dermatitis** A common chronic inflammatory dermatosis involving regions with a high density of sebaceous glands. | Unknown etiology. Possibly related to fungal species of the genus **Malassezia**. | Increased sebum production (in response to androgens) is a contributory factor. Increased incidence in patients with Parkinson disease. Severe, difficult-to-treat form in HIV-infected individuals with low CD4 counts. | Associated with inflammation of the epidermis, not a disease of the sebaceous glands per se. Sebum production is likely necessary but not sufficient to cause the disorder. | - | Affects scalp, forehead, external ear, nasolabial folds, and presternal area. Lesions are macules and papules on an erythematous-yellow, often greasy base, with scaling and crusting. Fissures may be present. **Dandruff** is the common expression on the scalp. | Shares features with spongiotic dermatitis and psoriasis. Early lesions are more spongiotic. Mounds of parakeratosis containing neutrophils and serum at the ostia of hair follicles (**follicular lipping**). Superficial perivascular inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes and neutrophils. | - | - | - | - | In Parkinson disease, symptoms improve with levodopa treatment. In HIV, incidence has fallen with effective antiviral therapy. |
| **Lichen Planus** A self-limited disorder of skin and mucosa summarized by the "six Ps." | Unknown etiology. | The **Koebner phenomenon** (induction by trauma) may be seen. | It is possible that expression of altered antigens in basal epidermal cells or the dermoepidermal junction elicits a cell-mediated cytotoxic (**CD8+**) T-cell response. | - | Itchy, violaceous, flat-topped papules that may coalesce into plaques. Papules are often highlighted by white dots or lines called **Wickham striae**. Usually multiple and symmetrically distributed on extremities (wrists, elbows). Oral lesions (in 70%) have a white, reticulated (net-like) appearance. | Characterized by a dense, continuous infiltrate of lymphocytes along the dermoepidermal junction (prototypic **interface dermatitis**). The dermoepidermal interface takes on an angulated, zigzag contour (**sawtoothing**). Basal keratinocytes show degeneration and necrosis. Anucleate, necrotic basal cells in the papillary dermis are called colloid or **Civatte bodies**. Shows changes of chronicity: hyperkeratosis and hypergranulosis. | The "six Ps": **P**ruritic, **P**urple, **P**olygonal, **P**lanar, **P**apules, and **P**laques. Usually resolves spontaneously in 1-2 years, leaving hyperpigmentation. | - | - | Squamous cell carcinoma can arise from chronic mucosal and paramucosal lichen planus. | - |
| **Pemphigus** A blistering disorder caused by autoantibodies that result in the dissolution of intercellular attachments (desmosomes) within the epidermis and mucosa. | Autoimmune disease. | Affects individuals in the fourth to sixth decades of life. | Caused by IgG autoantibodies against desmogleins, disrupting intercellular adhesion. The location of the blister depends on which desmogleins are targeted. In P. vulgaris, antibodies to Dsg3 (and often Dsg1) cause deep blisters. In P. foliaceus, antibodies to Dsg1 cause superficial blisters. The antibodies may also act by activating intercellular proteases. | Targets are desmosomal proteins: **Desmoglein 1 (Dsg1)** and **Desmoglein 3 (Dsg3)**. | **P. vulgaris:** Superficial vesicles and bullae that rupture easily, leaving shallow erosions covered with dried serum and crust. Oral ulcers may precede skin lesions.  **P. foliaceus:** Bullae are so superficial they present as areas of erythema and crusting. | Common feature is **acantholysis** (dissolution of intercellular bridges), causing cells to become rounded.  **P. vulgaris:** Acantholysis involves cells above the basal layer, creating a **suprabasal blister**. The intact basal cell layer is likened to a "row of tombstones".  **P. foliaceus:** Blisters form superficially at the stratum granulosum level.  **Immunofluorescence:** Shows a characteristic net-like pattern of intercellular IgG deposits throughout the epidermis. | Affects mucosa and skin, especially scalp, face, axilla, groin, trunk, and pressure points. | Direct immunofluorescence for IgG. | • **Pemphigus vulgaris** (most common type, >80% of cases) • **Pemphigus vegetans** • **Pemphigus foliaceus** (more benign form) • **Pemphigus erythematosus** • **Paraneoplastic pemphigus** | Paraneoplastic pemphigus occurs with various malignancies, most commonly non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Can be fatal if untreated. | Immunosuppressive agents to decrease titers of pathogenic antibodies. |
| **Bullous Pemphigoid** A blistering disorder caused by autoantibodies to proteins in the hemidesmosome, leading to subepidermal blisters. | Autoimmune disease. | Generally affects elderly individuals. | Caused by autoantibodies that bind to proteins required for adherence of basal keratinocytes to the basement membrane (hemidesmosomes). This triggers complement activation, recruitment of neutrophils and eosinophils, inflammation, and disruption of epidermal attachments, leading to blister formation. | Targets are proteins of the hemidesmosome, the **bullous pemphigoid antigens (BPAGs)**, particularly **BPAG2**. | Tense bullae filled with clear fluid on erythematous or normal-appearing skin. Do not rupture easily. Sites include inner thighs, flexor surfaces of forearms, axillae, groin, and lower abdomen. | **Subepidermal, nonacantholytic blisters**. Early lesions show a superficial/deep perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils, with superficial dermal edema and basal cell layer vacuolization. Eosinophils are typically present directly beneath the epidermal basal cell layer. **Immunofluorescence:** Continuous linear deposition of antibody (and complement) at the dermoepidermal junction. | Some patients present with urticarial plaques and severe pruritus. Oral lesions present in 10-15% of cases. | Direct immunofluorescence for complement/IgG. | - | - | - |
| **Dermatitis Herpetiformis** A rare disorder characterized by urticaria and grouped vesicles, associated with intestinal celiac disease. | Autoimmune reaction to dietary gluten. | Predominantly affects males in the third and fourth decades. Genetically predisposed individuals. | Genetically predisposed individuals develop IgA antibodies to dietary gluten (from gliadin). These antibodies are thought to cross-react with **reticulin**, a component of the anchoring fibrils that tether the epidermal basement membrane to the dermis. This injury and inflammation produce a subepidermal blister. | - | Bilateral, symmetric, grouped vesicles. Affects extensor surfaces, elbows, knees, upper back, and buttocks. | Fibrin and neutrophils accumulate selectively at the tips of dermal papillae, forming small **microabscesses**. Basal cells overlying these abscesses show vacuolization and focal separation, which coalesce to form a subepidermal blister. **Immunofluorescence:** Shows discontinuous, granular deposits of **IgA** that selectively localize in the tips of dermal papillae. | Plaques and vesicles are extremely pruritic. | Direct immunofluorescence for granular IgA deposits. | - | Association with intestinal **celiac disease**. | Gluten-free diet. |
| **Epidermolysis Bullosa** A group of inherited disorders caused by defects in structural proteins, leading to a proclivity to form blisters at sites of trauma. | Inherited genetic defects. | - | Defects in structural proteins lend mechanical instability to the skin. The level of the blister depends on the protein affected:  • **Simplex:** Basal cell layer. • **Junctional:** Lamina lucida of basement membrane. • **Dystrophic:** Below lamina densa. | • **Simplex type:** Mutations in genes for **keratin 14** or **keratin 5** (autosomal dominant). • **Junctional type:** Autosomal recessive defects in subunits of **laminin**, or mutations in **BPAG2**. • **Scarring dystrophic types:** Mutations in the **COL7A1** gene (encodes type VII collagen). | Blisters at sites of pressure, rubbing, or trauma, at or soon after birth. | Histologic changes can be so subtle that electron microscopy may be required. The level of cleavage is the key diagnostic feature (subepidermal, at lamina lucida, or within basal layer). | - | - | • **Simplex type** (most common, 75-85% of cases) • **Junctional type** • **Dystrophic types** • **Mixed types** | - | - |
| **Porphyria** A group of uncommon inborn or acquired disturbances of porphyrin metabolism. | Inborn or acquired disturbances of porphyrin metabolism. | Exposure to sunlight exacerbates cutaneous manifestations. | The pathogenesis of the skin alterations is not understood. | - | Urticaria and vesicles associated with scarring. | Vesicles are **subepidermal**. Adjacent dermis contains vessels with walls thickened by glassy deposits of serum proteins, including immunoglobulins. | - | - | Five major types including: congenital erythropoietic porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda, etc. | - | - |
| **Acne Vulgaris** A common inflammatory disorder of the pilosebaceous unit. | Multifactorial. | Middle to late teenage years. Males tend to have more severe disease. Can be induced/exacerbated by drugs (corticosteroids, testosterone), occupational exposures (oils, tars), and occlusion of glands (heavy clothing, cosmetics). Hereditary component. | **Four key factors:** **(1) Keratinization** of the lower follicular infundibulum, forming a keratin plug that blocks sebum outflow. **(2) Hypertrophy of sebaceous glands** during puberty under androgen influence. **(3) Lipase-synthesizing bacteria** (***Propionibacterium acnes***) colonizing the hair follicle and converting lipids to proinflammatory fatty acids. **(4) Secondary inflammation** of the involved follicle. | - | **Noninflammatory:** Open comedones (blackheads) and closed comedones (whiteheads).  **Inflammatory:** Erythematous papules, nodules, and pustules. | **Open comedones:** large, patulous orifices. **Closed comedones:** orifices only visible microscopically. Variable infiltrates of lymphocytes and macrophages in and around affected follicles. Extensive acute inflammation accompanies follicle rupture. Dermal abscesses may form. | - | - | • **Noninflammatory type** (open and closed comedones) • **Inflammatory type** (papules, pustules) | Severe variants (e.g., acne conglobata) can result in sinus tract formation and dermal scarring. | Antibiotics to eliminate P. acnes. Synthetic vitamin A derivative 13-cis-retinoic acid (isotretinoin) for severe cases. |
| **Rosacea** A common disease of middle age and beyond, characterized by persistent erythema and inflammation. | Proposed microbial triggers, but none proven. Related to high levels of cathelicidin. | Middle age and beyond. Predilection for females. | Individuals with rosacea have high cutaneous levels of the antimicrobial peptide **cathelicidin**. The peptides are qualitatively distinct due to alternative processing by proteases like **kallikrein 5**. Injection of these peptides into mice induces inflammation and vascular dilation. Activation of **TLR2** upregulates kallikrein 5 expression in keratinocytes, suggesting factors that stimulate TLR2 are involved.  **Stages:** (1) pre-rosacea (flushing), (2) persistent erythema and telangiectasia, (3) pustules and papules, (4) rhinophyma. | - | Persistent erythema and telangiectasia. Pustules and papules. Permanent thickening of nasal skin (rhinophyma). | Nonspecific perifollicular infiltrate of lymphocytes surrounded by dermal edema and telangiectasia. In the pustular phase, neutrophils may colonize follicles. Follicle rupture can cause a granulomatous response. Rhinophyma is associated with sebaceous gland hypertrophy and follicular plugging. | - | - | - | **Rhinophyma**: permanent thickening of the nasal skin by confluent erythematous papules and prominent follicles. | - |
| **Erythema Nodosum** The most common form of panniculitis (inflammation of subcutaneous adipose tissue), preferentially affecting the connective tissue septa. | Associated with infections (streptococcal, TB), drugs (sulfonamides, oral contraceptives), sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and malignant neoplasms. Many times cause is not identified. | - | Thought to be caused by a **delayed hypersensitivity reaction** to microbial or drug-related antigens. In some cases, immune complexes have been implicated. | - | Poorly defined, exquisitely tender, erythematous plaques and nodules on lower legs. Over weeks, lesions flatten and become bruise-like, leaving no scars. | A form of **septal panniculitis**. Connective tissue septa are widened by edema, fibrin, and neutrophilic infiltration (early lesions), later infiltrated by lymphocytes, histiocytes, and giant cells with septal fibrosis. **Vasculitis is not present.** | Fever and malaise may accompany the cutaneous signs. | - | - | - | - |
| **Erythema Induratum** An uncommon panniculitis affecting fat lobules, now regarded as a primary vasculitis. | Originally considered a hypersensitivity response to tuberculosis; today most commonly occurs without an associated underlying disease. | Affects primarily adolescents and menopausal women. | Regarded as a **primary vasculitis** of deep vessels supplying the fat lobules of the subcutis. The associated vascular compromise leads to fat necrosis and inflammation. | - | Erythematous, slightly tender nodule that usually goes on to ulcerate. | A form of **lobular panniculitis**. Granulomatous inflammation and zones of caseous necrosis involve the fat lobule. Early lesions show **necrotizing vasculitis** affecting small- to medium-sized arteries and veins in the deep dermis and subcutis. | - | - | - | Ulceration. | - |
| **Verrucae (Warts)** Squamoproliferative lesions caused by human papillomaviruses (HPVs). | Human papillomaviruses (HPVs). | Common in children and adolescents. Transmission by direct contact or autoinoculation. | Low-risk HPVs produce E6 proteins that interfere with **Notch signaling**, which is required for normal keratinocyte maturation. This likely contributes to the epidermal hyperplasia that characterizes warts. High-risk HPVs produce E6 proteins that abolish p53 function. | - | **Verruca vulgaris:** Gray-white to tan, flat to convex papules with a rough, pebble-like surface; usually on hands. **Verruca plana (flat wart):** Flat, smooth, tan papules; on face or hands. **Condyloma acuminatum (venereal wart):** Soft, tan, cauliflower-like masses. | Features common to verrucae include: **(1)** Verrucous or papillomatous epidermal hyperplasia. **(2)** Cytoplasmic vacuolization (**koilocytosis**) in superficial epidermal layers, producing haloes of pallor around infected nuclei. Infected cells also show prominent keratohyaline granules and eosinophilic keratin aggregates. **Stains:** In situ hybridization can demonstrate HPV DNA within epidermal cells. | Generally self-limited, regressing spontaneously within 6 months to 2 years. | - | • **Verruca vulgaris** (common wart) • **Verruca plana** (flat wart) • **Verruca plantaris** and **verruca palmaris** (on soles and palms) • **Condyloma acuminatum** (venereal wart) | HPV type 16 is associated with in situ squamous cell carcinoma. HPV types 5 and 8 are associated with SCC in epidermodysplasia verruciformis. | - |
| **Molluscum Contagiosum** A common, self-limited viral disease of the skin caused by a poxvirus. | Poxvirus (one of the largest viruses in nature). | Spread by direct contact, particularly among children and young adults. | - | - | Multiple firm, pruritic, pink to skin-colored umbilicated papules (0.2 to 0.4 cm). Predilection for trunk and anogenital areas. A curd-like material can be expressed from the central umbilication. | Lesions show cup-like verrucous epidermal hyperplasia. The diagnostic structure is the **molluscum body**, a large (up to 35 μm), ellipsoid, homogeneous cytoplasmic inclusion found in cells of the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum. Numerous virions are present within these bodies. **Stains:** With H&E, inclusions are eosinophilic in stratum granulosum and become pale blue in stratum corneum. Giemsa stain of expressed material shows molluscum bodies. | Self-limited disease. | - | - | - | - |
| **Impetigo** A common superficial bacterial skin infection. | Now usually caused by ***S. aureus***. Formerly caused by group A β-hemolytic streptococci. | Highly contagious. Frequently seen in healthy children and adults in poor health. Involves exposed skin (face, hands). | Bacterial production of a toxin that specifically cleaves **desmoglein 1**, the protein responsible for cell-to-cell adhesion in the uppermost epidermal layers. This is analogous to pemphigus foliaceus where an autoantibody targets Dsg1. Because there is no dermal involvement, lesions heal without scarring. | - | Starts as an erythematous macule, but small pustules rapidly supervene. As pustules break, they form shallow erosions covered with drying serum, giving the characteristic appearance of a **honey-colored crust**. | Characteristic feature is accumulation of **neutrophils beneath the stratum corneum**, often producing a subcorneal pustule. Special stains reveal bacteria in these foci. | - | - | • **Impetigo contagiosa** • **Impetigo bullosa** (bullous form) | - | Elimination of bacteria. |
| **Superficial Fungal Infections** Fungal infections of the skin confined to the stratum corneum, caused primarily by dermatophytes. | Dermatophytes. *Malassezia furfur* (a yeast) causes tinea versicolor. | For tinea corporis: excessive heat/humidity, exposure to infected animals. For tinea cruris: obesity, warm weather, heat, friction, maceration. | Organisms grow in soil and on animals. The inflammatory reaction appears to be a result of the dermatophyte itself and bacterial superinfection. | - | **Tinea corporis:** Expanding, round, slightly erythematous plaque with an elevated scaling border. **Tinea cruris:** Moist, red patches with raised scaly borders on upper inner thighs. **Tinea versicolor:** Groups of macules of varied size and color with a fine peripheral scale on upper trunk. | Variable features. May be mild eczematous dermatitis with intraepidermal neutrophils.  **Special Stains:** Fungi stain bright pink to red with **periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain**. They are found in the anucleate cornified layer of skin, hair, or nails. Culture of scraped material permits identification. | - | PAS stain. Culture. | Classified by location: • **Tinea capitis** (scalp) • **Tinea barbae** (beard area) • **Tinea corporis** (body) • **Tinea cruris** ("jock itch") • **Tinea pedis** ("athlete's foot") • **Tinea versicolor** | Bacterial superinfection. **Onychomycosis** (infection of the nails). | - |
