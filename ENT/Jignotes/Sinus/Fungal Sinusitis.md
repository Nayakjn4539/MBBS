# Fungal Rhinosinusitis

**Fungal Rhinosinusitis** is an inflammation of the nasal and paranasal sinus mucosa caused by fungal infection. It is broadly classified into two categories based on the presence or absence of microscopic invasion of the fungal hyphae into the mucosal tissue: **Invasive** and **Non-invasive**.

## Classification

The consensus panel (Chakravarti et al., 2009) classifies fungal sinus disease as follows:

| Category | Subtypes | Key Feature | Immune Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Non-Invasive** | 1. [[Fungal Ball]] (Mycetoma)<br>2. [[Allergic Fungal Rhinosinusitis]] (AFRS)<br>3. Saprophytic Fungal Infestation | No tissue invasion by fungus. | Immunocompetent |
| **Invasive** | 1. [[Acute Invasive Fungal Sinusitis]] (Fulminant)<br>2. Chronic Invasive Fungal Sinusitis<br>3. Granulomatous Invasive Fungal Sinusitis | Fungal hyphae invade mucosa, bone, and blood vessels. | Immunocompromised (Acute)<br>Immunocompetent (Granulomatous) |

## 1. Non-Invasive Fungal Sinusitis

These forms occur in immunocompetent individuals and do not show microscopic evidence of fungal hyphae within the mucosal tissue.

### A. Fungal Ball (Mycetoma)
*   **Definition:** Clumps of fungal spores/hyphae within a sinus cavity without invasion.
*   **Etiology:** Most commonly **[[Aspergillus]]** (*A. fumigatus*).
*   **Site:** **[[Maxillary Sinus]]** is the most common site, followed by sphenoid.
*   **Pathogenesis:** Often due to entrapment of fungi (inhalational) or via **[[Oroantral Fistula]]** (following dental procedures).
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Often asymptomatic.
    *   Unilateral nasal obstruction or purulent discharge.
    *   **Cacosmia** (foul smell).
    *   Facial pain.
*   **Investigations:**
    *   **Nasal Endoscopy:** Shows cheesy, clay-like debris (dense mass of fungal hyphae).
    *   **CT Scan:** Sinus opacification with a central hyperdense area (metallic density due to Calcium, Magnesium, Iron, Manganese). No bone erosion usually seen.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Surgical:** [[Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery]] (**FESS**) to remove the fungal mass and restore drainage.
    *   **Medical:** Systemic antifungal treatment is **not** required.

### B. Allergic Fungal Rhinosinusitis (AFRS)
*   **Definition:** A hypersensitivity reaction (Type I) to fungal antigens in atopic individuals.
*   **Etiology:** Dematiaceous fungi (pigmented) like **[[Bipolaris]]**, **[[Curvularia]]**, **[[Alternaria]]**, and sometimes *Aspergillus*.
*   **Pathophysiology:** Fungal spores entrapment $\rightarrow$ Type I Hypersensitivity $\rightarrow$ Eosinophilic mucin production $\rightarrow$ Obstruction of osteomeatal complex $\rightarrow$ Polyposis.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Young, immunocompetent adults with a history of atopy/asthma.
    *   Unilateral or asymmetric nasal polyposis.
    *   Discharge of thick, tenacious, eosinophilic mucin described as **"Peanut Butter"** or **"Axle Grease"**.
*   **Diagnosis (Bent and Kuhn Criteria):** All 5 major criteria must be met.

**Bent and Kuhn Diagnostic Criteria for AFRS:**
| Major Criteria | Minor Criteria |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1. Type I Hypersensitivity (Raised IgE) | 1. Asthma |
| 2. [[Nasal Polyps]] | 2. Unilateral predominance |
| 3. Characteristic **[[CT Scan]]** findings | 3. Fungal culture positive |
| 4. **Eosinophilic Mucin** (without invasion) | 4. Charcot-Leyden crystals |
| 5. Positive Fungal Stain/Smear | 5. Serum eosinophilia |

*   **Imaging Features:**
    *   **CT Scan:** **Double Density Sign** (or Rail track sign). Heterogeneous opacities due to heavy metal deposits (Fe, Ca, Mn) within the mucin. Sinus expansion and thinning of bony walls due to pressure necrosis (not invasion).
    *   **MRI:** Central signal void on T2 (due to metals) and peripheral enhancement.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Surgical:** **FESS** to remove polyps and all allergic mucin.
    *   **Medical:** **Systemic Corticosteroids** (to suppress inflammation) and topical steroids post-operatively. Immunotherapy may be used. Systemic antifungals are usually reserved for refractory cases.

### C. Saprophytic Fungal Infestation
*   Colonization of mucous crusts within the nose (often after sinus surgery) without symptoms or invasion.
*   **Treatment:** Nasal douching/cleaning crusts.

## 2. Invasive Fungal Sinusitis

These forms involve fungal invasion into the mucosa, blood vessels, and bone. They are serious and often life-threatening.

### A. Acute Invasive (Fulminant) Fungal Sinusitis
*   **Definition:** Rapidly progressive (<4 weeks) invasion of fungi into tissues, blood vessels (**Angioinvasion**), and bone.
*   **Risk Factors:** Immunocompromised states:
    *   **Uncontrolled [[Diabetes Mellitus]] (DKA)** - most common for Mucormycosis.
    *   Neutropenia (Chemotherapy/Leukemia).
    *   Post-transplant immunosuppression.
    *   Long-term steroid use.
    *   AIDS.
*   **Etiology:**
    *   **[[Mucormycosis]] (Zygomycosis):** Caused by *Rhizopus*, *Mucor*. Characterized by broad, aseptate, ribbon-like hyphae branching at **90° (right angles)**.
    *   **Invasive [[Aspergillosis]]:** Caused by *A. fumigatus*. Narrow, septate hyphae branching at **45° (acute angles)**.
*   **Pathology:** Fungi invade endothelium $\rightarrow$ Vasculitis & Thrombosis $\rightarrow$ Ischemic **Necrosis** (Black Eschar).
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Fever, severe facial pain, nasal obstruction.
    *   **Black Necrotic Eschar:** Seen on nasal turbinates, septum, or palate (due to ischemia).
    *   **Orbital Extension:** Proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, blindness (Orbital Apex Syndrome).
    *   **Intracranial Extension:** Cavernous sinus thrombosis, cerebral abscess, altered sensorium.
    *   Nasal/Palatal anesthesia (due to nerve involvement).
*   **Investigations:**
    *   **Diagnostic Nasal Endoscopy:** Pale/black turbinates, insensate mucosa.
    *   **Biopsy (Gold Standard):** Demonstrates fungal invasion into tissue. KOH mount shows hyphae type.
    *   **MRI:** Superior to CT for detecting early soft tissue invasion, orbital, and intracranial spread.
*   **Treatment:** **MEDICAL EMERGENCY**
    1.  **Surgical:** Aggressive **Surgical Debridement** of all necrotic tissue until bleeding (healthy) margins are reached.
    2.  **Medical:** High dose parenteral Antifungals.
        *   **Liposomal [[Amphotericin B]]** (Drug of Choice).
        *   Posaconazole/Isavuconazole (Step down).
    3.  **Supportive:** Reversal of underlying cause (e.g., control DKA, correct neutropenia).

### B. Chronic Invasive Fungal Sinusitis
*   **Definition:** Invasive disease progressing slowly over >12 weeks.
*   **Population:** Often seen in subtly immunocompromised (e.g., diabetics) or immunocompetent patients.
*   **Organism:** *Aspergillus fumigatus* (MC).
*   **Features:** Dense fibrous tissue reaction, orbital apex syndrome, dense soft tissue mass in the sphenoid/ethmoid.
*   **Histology:** Fungal invasion with granulomas.
*   **Treatment:** Surgical debridement + Oral Antifungals (Voriconazole/Itraconazole).

### C. Granulomatous Invasive Fungal Sinusitis
*   **Epidemiology:** Seen in immunocompetent individuals, endemic in **North Africa (Sudan)**, India, Pakistan.
*   **Organism:** *Aspergillus flavus*.
*   **Clinical:** Firm, woody swelling of the cheek/orbit, painless proptosis.
*   **Histology:** Non-caseating granulomas with foreign body giant cells containing fungi.
*   **Treatment:** Surgery + Antifungals (Itraconazole).

## Comparison of Fungal Hyphae (Important for Exams)

| Feature | Mucor/Rhizopus | Aspergillus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Morphology** | Broad, Ribbon-like | Narrow, filamentous |
| **Septation** | **Aseptate** (Non-septate) | **Septate** |
| **Branching** | **Right Angle (90°)** | **Acute Angle (45°)** |
| **H&E Stain** | Irregular stain | Uniform stain |

## Clinical Implications & "Red Flags"

*   **Black Eschar:** Presence of a black crust or necrotic turbinate in a diabetic patient is **Mucormycosis** until proven otherwise. Immediate biopsy and Amphotericin B are required.
*   **Double Density Sign:** On CT scan, central hyperdensity within hypodense mucosa is pathognomonic for **Allergic Fungal Rhinosinusitis** or Fungal Ball.
*   **Peanut Butter Mucin:** Thick, eosinophilic mucin found intra-operatively is a hallmark of AFRS.
