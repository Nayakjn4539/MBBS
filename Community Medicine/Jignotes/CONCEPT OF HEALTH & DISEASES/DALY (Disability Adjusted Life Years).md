# [[CONCEPT OF HEALTH & DISEASES]] > DALY (Disability Adjusted Life Years).

### DALY (Disability Adjusted Life Years)

**DALY** is a health gap measure that extends the concept of potential years of life lost due to premature death to include equivalent years of “healthy” life lost by virtue of being in states of poor health or disability. It is the best measure of the [[Burden of Disease]] in a defined population.

### 1. Definition
**DALY** is defined as the number of **years of life lost** due to premature death plus the **years lived with disability** adjusted for the severity of the disability.

> **Core Concept:** One DALY can be thought of as **one lost year of "healthy" life**.

### 2. The Formula
The DALY is calculated by the sum of two components:

$$DALY = YLL + YLD$$

Where:
*   **YLL (Years of Lost Life):** Calculated from the number of deaths at each age multiplied by the expected remaining years of life.
    *   *Standard:* **Japanese life expectancy statistics** are used as the standard for measuring premature death (as they have the longest life expectancy).
*   **YLD (Years Lost to Disability):** Calculated by multiplying the number of incident cases of injury/illness by the average duration of the disease and a **weighting factor**.
    *   *Weighting Scale:* Reflects severity from 0 (perfect health) to 1 (dead).

### 3. Key Characteristics
*   **Origin:** Developed by Harvard University for the [[World Bank]] in 1990; adopted by WHO in 2000.
*   **Social Weighting:** The value of each year of life depends on age. Years lived as a **young adult** are often valued more highly than years spent as a young child or older adult. This reflects society's interest in productivity and return on investment in upbringing.
*   **Combined Measure:** Unlike traditional mortality indicators (like IMR or CDR), DALYs measure **both mortality and disability** together.

### 4. Uses of DALY
1.  **Setting Priorities:** Assists in the allocation of health resources by identifying which conditions cause the most significant burden.
2.  **Evaluation:** Measures the effectiveness of health interventions (Cost-effectiveness analysis).
3.  **Comparison:** Allows comparison of health status between different countries and populations.

### 5. DALY vs. QALY vs. HALE
It is crucial not to confuse DALY with other similar indices:

| Indicator | Full Form | Focus | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DALY** | Disability Adjusted Life Years | **Burden of Disease** | 1 DALY = 1 Year of healthy life **LOST** |
| **QALY** | [[Quality Adjusted Life Years]] | **Intervention Outcome** | 1 QALY = 1 Year of life lived in **PERFECT** health (Used to assess value for money of medical interventions) |
| **HALE** | Health-Adjusted Life Expectancy | **Life Expectancy** | Equivalent years a newborn can expect to live in **FULL** health |

### 6. Clinical & Public Health Relevance
*   **The "Hidden" Burden:** DALYs reveal the impact of non-fatal conditions. For example, **Psychiatric and Neurological conditions** account for nearly 28% of years lived with disability (YLD) but only 1.4% of deaths. Traditional mortality rates miss this burden, but DALYs capture it.
*   **Indian Context:** In India, the number of DALYs lost per 1000 population is approx **350** (Death component: 250 + Disability component: 100).
*   **Global Burden:** Ischaemic heart disease, Stroke, and Lower respiratory infections are top causes of DALYs globally.

### Mnemonic for DALY Components
**"DALY is S.A.D."**
*   **S** = **S**everity adjusted (Disability weighting)
*   **A** = **A**ge weighted (Social weighting)
*   **D** = **D**isability + **D**eath (YLD + YLL)
