# Disposal of Wastes: Excreta Disposal

Proper disposal of human excreta is fundamental to environmental health. It creates a [[Sanitation Barrier]] that breaks the cycle of disease transmission.

### The Sanitation Barrier Concept
The primary aim of excreta disposal is to break the transmission cycle of faecal-borne diseases by segregating faeces from the **5 F's**:
1.  **F**luids (Water)
2.  **F**ingers
3.  **F**lies
4.  **F**omites
5.  **F**ood,

### 1. Septic Tank
A septic tank is a water-tight masonry tank used for the treatment of household sewage. It is a satisfactory method for individual dwellings, small groups of houses, or institutions that have an adequate water supply but **no access to a public sewerage system**,,.

#### Design Features
*   **Capacity:** Minimum capacity should be **500 gallons**,,.
*   **Dimensions:**
    *   Length: Usually twice the breadth,.
    *   Depth: 1.5 to 2 meters,.
    *   Liquid Depth: Recommended **1.2 meters**,.
*   **Air Space:** Minimum **30 cm** between the liquid level and the cover,.
*   **Retention Period:** Ideally **24 hours**. Too short leads to insufficient treatment; too long causes undue septicity,,.
*   **Inlet/Outlet:** Submerged to avoid disturbing the surface scum.

#### Mechanism of Purification
Purification occurs in two distinct stages:

| Stage | Location | Process | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Anaerobic Digestion** | **Inside** the Tank | Decomposition | Solids settle as **Sludge**; grease/fat rise as **Scum**. Anaerobic bacteria break down solids into simple chemicals, liquids, and gases (methane),,. |
| **2. Aerobic Oxidation** | **Outside** the Tank (Sub-soil) | Oxidation | The liquid **Effluent** flows into the soil via soak pits/trenches. Aerobic bacteria in the soil oxidize organic matter into stable end-products (nitrates, CO2, water),,. |

**Clinical Relevance:** The effluent from a septic tank is **not** safe or innocuous. It contains viable bacteria, cysts, and helminthic ova. It must be disposed of via sub-soil irrigation/soak pits and never discharged directly into open drains,.

#### Operation and Maintenance
*   **Avoid Disinfectants:** Soap water and phenols should be avoided as they kill the bacterial flora essential for digestion,,.
*   **Desludging:** Removal of sludge is required annually or when the sludge/scum volume reduces capacity,.
*   **Seeding:** Newly built tanks should be "seeded" with ripe sludge to introduce the necessary bacteria,.

### 2. RCA Latrine (Research-Cum-Action)
The RCA latrine is a type of **Sanitary Latrine** (Non-service type). It is a hand-flushed, [[Water Seal Latrine]] designed suitable for rural areas,.

#### Key Components
1.  **Squatting Plate:** Made of impervious material (cement concrete), 90 cm square with a slope towards the pan for drainage. Raised footrests are included,.
2.  **Pan:** Receives night soil. Length 42.5 cm; designed with a slope to ensure flushing.
3.  **Trap (The Critical Component):**
    *   A bent pipe (7.5 cm diameter) connecting the pan to the pit.
    *   It holds water to form a **Water Seal**.
    *   **Depth of Water Seal:** **2 cm (20 mm)**,,.
    *   **Functions of the Seal:**
        *   Prevents escape of foul gases (odour),.
        *   Prevents access by flies,.
4.  **Connecting Pipe:** Leads waste from the trap to the pit (in indirect types),.
5.  **Dug Well/Pit:** Usually 75 cm in diameter and 3–3.5 meters deep. Can be lined with honeycomb brickwork or pottery rings in loose soil,.

#### Advantages
*   **Hygienic:** No smell and no fly breeding due to the water seal.
*   **Water Efficient:** Requires only small quantity (**1-2 liters**) of water to flush.
*   **Location:** Can be built near the house (unlike open pits).
*   **Flexibility:** Can be Direct (pit below pan) or Indirect (pit away from pan). The indirect type allows switching to a second pit when the first fills up,.

#### Location Criteria
*   Should be at least **15 meters (50 feet)** away from a water source,.
*   Should be at a lower elevation than the water source to prevent contamination,.

### Summary of Differences

| Feature | Septic Tank | RCA Latrine |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Use** | Households with water supply but no sewer | Rural/Semi-urban areas |
| **Water Requirement** | High (water carriage) | Low (Hand/Pour flush) |
| **Mechanism** | Anaerobic digestion + Aerobic oxidation | Anaerobic digestion in pit |
| **Disposal** | Effluent needs soak pit | Leaches into surrounding soil |
| **Cost** | Expensive | Low Cost |

**Mnemonic for Sanitation Barrier (5 F's):**
**F**luid (Water)
**F**ingers
**F**lies
**F**omites
**F**ood
*(Sanitation blocks the transmission from Faeces to these 5)*
