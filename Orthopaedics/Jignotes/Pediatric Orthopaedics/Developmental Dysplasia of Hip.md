# [[Pediatric Orthopaedics]] > Developmental Dysplasia of Hip

### [[Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip]] (DDH): Clinical Tests and Signs

The diagnosis of [[Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip]] (DDH) evolves with the age of the child. In the neonate, the hip is unstable (dislocatable or reducible), whereas, in the older infant, the hip becomes fixed in its displaced position, leading to limited motion and structural changes.

### 1. Neonatal Screening Tests (0–3 Months)
These tests rely on the principle of **instability**. They must be performed on a relaxed child lying on a firm surface, examining one hip at a time.

#### [[Barlow’s Test]] (Provocative Test)
This test attempts to dislocate an unstable hip.
*   **Technique:**
    1.  The examiner grasps the upper thigh with fingers on the [[greater trochanter]] and the thumb on the inner thigh.
    2.  The hips are flexed to 90° and knees are fully flexed.
    3.  The hip is **adducted** (brought towards the midline).
    4.  Gentle **posterior pressure** is applied along the long axis of the femur.
*   **Positive Sign:** A palpable sensation of the [[femoral head]] slipping *out* of the [[acetabulum]] over the posterior rim. This indicates the hip is **dislocatable**,.

> **Mnemonic:** **BAHAR LO** (Hindi/Urdu for "Take it out") - **B**arlow: **A**dduction + **H**and **A**pplies **R**ear (Posterior) pressure = **L**eaves **O**ut.

#### [[Ortolani’s Test]] (Reductive Maneuver)
This test attempts to reduce a dislocated hip. It is the reverse of Barlow's test.
*   **Technique:**
    1.  The examiner holds the child’s knees and thighs (thumb on medial thigh, fingers on greater trochanter).
    2.  The hip is flexed to 90°.
    3.  The thigh is gently **abducted** (moved away from midline).
    4.  The examiner's fingers lift the **greater trochanter** anteriorly (upwards) to push the head back into the socket.
*   **Positive Sign:** A palpable, distinct **"clunk"** (not a high-pitched click) is felt as the femoral head slips back *into* the [[acetabulum]]. This indicates the hip is **reducible**,.

> **Clinical Implication:** These tests are most reliable in the first few weeks of life. By 3–6 months, muscle tightness develops, making these maneuvers difficult or impossible (negative), even if the hip remains dislocated.

### 2. Signs in Older Infants (3–18 Months)
As the child grows, the dislocated hip becomes "fixed," and instability signs (Barlow/Ortolani) disappear. The diagnosis relies on structural asymmetry and tightness.

#### [[Limitation of Abduction]]
*   **Description:** This is the **most consistent and sensitive** clinical sign in older infants.
*   **Mechanism:** Adaptive shortening (contracture) of the [[adductor muscles]] and soft tissues prevents the hip from opening fully.
*   **Testing:** With the child supine and hips flexed to 90°, the examiner abducts both hips simultaneously. The affected side will show restricted abduction compared to the normal side,.

#### [[Galeazzi Sign]] (Allis’ Sign)
*   **Technique:** The child lies supine with hips flexed to 45° and knees flexed to 90°, feet flat on the table.
*   **Observation:** Look at the level of the knees.
*   **Positive Sign:** The knee on the affected side lies **lower** than the normal side.
*   **Cause:** Apparent shortening of the femoral segment because the femoral head lies posterior and superior to the acetabulum,.

#### Asymmetry of Skin Creases
*   **Observation:** Look for deep, asymmetrical skin folds in the groin, medial thigh, or gluteal region.
*   **Significance:** While extra creases can suggest DDH, they are non-specific and can occur in normal chubby infants. However, asymmetry of the **gluteal folds** is considered more significant than thigh folds.

#### [[Telescopy]] (Pistoning)
*   **Technique:** With the child supine, the hip and knee are flexed to 90°. The examiner stabilizes the pelvis with one hand and applies push-and-pull force along the axis of the femur with the other.
*   **Positive Sign:** Excessive up-and-down movement (pistoning) of the greater trochanter is felt.
*   **Indication:** Suggests the femoral head is not contained within the acetabulum (instability).

### 3. Signs in the Walking Child (>18 Months)
When the child begins to walk, the mechanical disadvantage of the dislocated hip becomes apparent.

| Sign/Test | Description | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Trendelenburg Gait]]** | A lurching gait towards the affected side (unilateral DDH). | Weakness/inefficiency of the [[gluteus medius]] muscle (abductor mechanism) due to loss of fulcrum. |
| **[[Waddling Gait]]** | "Duck-like" gait (bilateral DDH). | Bilateral abductor insufficiency requiring swaying to maintain balance. |
| **Increased [[Lumbar Lordosis]]** | Exaggerated curvature of the lower spine (bilateral DDH). | Posterior displacement of the femoral heads shifts the center of gravity, causing compensatory pelvic tilt. |
| **Widened [[Perineum]]** | Increased space between thighs. | Lateral displacement of femoral heads in bilateral dislocation. |

#### [[Trendelenburg Test]]
*   **Technique:** The patient stands on the affected leg.
*   **Positive Result:** The pelvis drops on the **opposite** (unsupported) side.
*   **Reason:** The abductor muscles on the standing (dislocated) leg cannot hold the pelvis level because the fulcrum (femoral head in acetabulum) is missing or unstable.

### 4. Special Anatomical Tests

#### [[Klisic Test]]
*   **Technique:** Place the index finger on the [[Anterior Superior Iliac Spine]] (ASIS) and the middle finger on the [[greater trochanter]]. Draw an imaginary line extending strictly through these two points.
*   **Normal:** The line points towards the [[umbilicus]].
*   **DDH:** The line passes **below the umbilicus** (horizontal trajectory) because the greater trochanter is elevated (migrated proximally),.

#### [[Vascular Sign of Narath]]
*   **Observation:** Palpate the [[femoral artery]] pulse in the groin.
*   **DDH:** The pulse is felt less distinctly or is weaker compared to the normal side because the femoral head (which normally supports the artery) is absent from its position behind the vessel.

### 5. Radiological Signs (X-ray)
Plain X-rays are useful once the **femoral head ossific nucleus** appears (usually after 4-6 months). Before this, [[Ultrasonography]] is the investigation of choice.

*   **[[Shenton’s Line]]:** A continuous smooth curve drawn along the inferior border of the femoral neck and the superior border of the obturator foramen. In DDH, this line is **broken/interrupted**,.
*   **[[Perkins Line]]:** A vertical line drawn at the outer edge of the acetabulum. The femoral head normally lies medial to this line. In DDH, the head lies **lateral** to it.
*   **[[Hilgenreiner’s Line]]:** A horizontal line connecting the triradiate cartilages. The femoral head should be below this line. In DDH, the head migrates **superiorly**.
*   **[[Acetabular Index]]:** The angle of the acetabular roof. Normally <30° in newborns. An angle **>30°** indicates dysplasia (shallow acetabulum).
