# [[HEALTH PLANNING & MANAGEMENT]] > Feedback is very important in health planning

### **Concept of Feedback in Health Planning**

**Feedback** is the flow of information from the audience (beneficiaries/community) back to the sender (planner/administrator). It represents the **reaction** of the audience to the message or the health programme. In the context of [[Health Planning]], it is the mechanism that converts a linear process into a circular, continuous, and dynamic one.

### **Importance of Feedback**

1.  **Rectification of Errors:** Feedback helps identify deviations from the planned course of action. If a specific health intervention is not working as intended, feedback allows the system to identify the gap and apply **corrective measures**,.
2.  **Modification of Strategy:** It provides an opportunity for the planner to modify the message or the programme components to render them more acceptable to the community. If the message is not clear or the service is rejected, feedback highlights this rejection immediately (in interpersonal settings) or later (in mass programs),.
3.  **Two-Way Process:** It transforms planning from a "dictatorial" one-way flow into a democratic **two-way process**. It ensures that the programme is not just imposed from the top but is responsive to the [[felt needs]] of the community,.
4.  **Improving Data Quality:** In systems like the [[Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP)]] or [[Health Management Information System (HMIS)]], providing feedback to peripheral workers (like the [[ANM]] or [[ASHA]]) on the quality of data they submitted is essential to maintain their support and improve future reporting,.
5.  **Evaluation and Re-planning:** Feedback is the core component of **evaluation**. It helps assess whether the objectives were met and provides the necessary data for the **re-assessment** of the health situation, leading to better planning for the next cycle,.

### **Mechanism of Feedback in the Planning Cycle**

Feedback operates effectively through the following management functions:

*   **Monitoring:** Continuous observation of activities. If monitoring reveals a lag in supply or performance, feedback is sent to the management to release resources,.
*   **Evaluation:** Assessing the final outcome. The results of the evaluation act as feedback for the next planning phase.
*   **Communication:** In health education, feedback ensures the receiver has understood the message correctly. Without it, communication is merely information dumping.

### **Comparison: With vs. Without Feedback**

| Feature | System **Without** Feedback (Open Loop) | System **With** Feedback (Closed Loop) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nature** | One-way communication (Didactic) | Two-way communication (Socratic) |
| **Flexibility** | Rigid; cannot adapt to changes | Flexible; modifies based on reaction |
| **Error Correction** | Difficult; errors accumulate | Immediate correction possible |
| **Example** | Lecture method, Mass Media (TV/Radio) | [[Group Discussion]], Counseling, Sentinel Surveillance |
| **Effectiveness** | Lower compliance | Higher compliance and behavior change |

### **Methods of Obtaining Feedback**

*   **Routine Reports and Returns:** Monthly progress reports from [[PHC]]/[[Sub-centre]].
*   **Surveys:** Community surveys to assess satisfaction and utilization.
*   **Audits:** [[Medical Audit]] or death reviews (e.g., [[Maternal Death Review]]) to find causes of failure,.
*   **Supervision:** Direct observation and interaction with field staff.
*   **Sentinel Surveillance:** Identifying missing cases and supplementing routine data.

### **Mnemonic for Importance of Feedback**

**"REACT"**

*   **R** - **Rectify** errors (Transmission errors or implementation gaps)
*   **E** - **Evaluate** performance against objectives
*   **A** - **Adjust** the plan/message based on audience reaction
*   **C** - **Control** the operations (Management function)
*   **T** - **Two-way** communication (Ensures participation)

### **Clinical & Field Relevance**

*   **Patient Compliance:** A doctor prescribes medication (Input). If the patient returns with side effects or lack of improvement (Feedback), the doctor changes the dosage or drug (Corrective Action). Without this feedback, the treatment fails.
*   **Program Success:** In the [[National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP)]], default retrieval is a feedback mechanism. If a patient misses a dose, the system is alerted (Feedback), and the provider tracks the patient (Action) to ensure adherence.
