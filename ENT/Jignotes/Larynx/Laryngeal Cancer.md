# **Laryngeal Cancer**

### **Overview**
**Laryngeal cancer** is the most common malignancy of the upper aerodigestive tract, with [[Squamous Cell Carcinoma]] (SCC) accounting for 95-98% of cases,,. It predominantly affects males (10:1 ratio compared to females) between the ages of 40 and 70, though incidence in females is rising due to increased smoking habits.

### **Etiology and Risk Factors**
The etiology is multifactorial. A helpful mnemonic for risk factors is **TARGET**:
*   **T** - **Tobacco:** The principal risk factor. Carcinogens include benzopyrene,.
*   **A** - **Alcohol:** Synergistic effect with tobacco; increases risk 15-fold when combined.
*   **R** - **Radiation:** Previous neck irradiation.
*   **G** - **Genetic:** Familial tendency and p53/p16 gene alterations.
*   **E** - **Environmental/Occupational:** Asbestos, wood dust, mustard gas, petroleum products,.
*   **T** - **Tumors:** History of head and neck cancer (second primary).

**Other Factors:**
*   **[[Human Papilloma Virus]] (HPV):** Subtypes 16 and 18.
*   **[[Laryngopharyngeal Reflux]] (LPR):** Chronic acid irritation,.
*   **Dietary:** Lack of fruits/vegetables; specific teas (mate).

### **Surgical Anatomy and Subsites**
The larynx is divided into three oncological subsites, which dictate the pattern of spread and prognosis.

| Subsite | Structures Included | Lymphatic Drainage | Clinical Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Supraglottis]]** | Epiglottis (supra/infrahyoid), aryepiglottic folds, arytenoids, ventricular bands (false cords), ventricles,. | **Rich:** Drains to upper (Level II) and middle (Level III) deep cervical nodes. | High risk of early and bilateral lymphatic metastasis (20–40% occult nodes),. |
| **[[Glottis]]** | True vocal cords, anterior and posterior commissures,. | **Scanty:** Almost no lymphatics in Reinke's space,. | Lymphatic spread is rare/late. Best prognosis. Most common site. |
| **[[Subglottis]]** | From 10mm below true cords to lower border of cricoid cartilage,. | Drains to prelaryngeal ([[Delphian node]]), pretracheal, and paratracheal nodes. | Poor prognosis due to late presentation and silent spread. |

### **Pathology**
*   **Gross Appearance:** Can be exophytic (proliferative), ulcerative, or infiltrative.
*   **Histology:**
    *   **[[Squamous Cell Carcinoma]] (SCC):** Most common (>90%),. Glottic tumors are usually well-differentiated; supraglottic are often anaplastic.
    *   **Variants:** [[Verrucous Carcinoma]] (Ackerman tumor - locally invasive, no metastasis), Spindle cell carcinoma, Adenocarcinoma.
    *   **Pre-malignant lesions:** [[Leukoplakia]], Erythroplakia, Carcinoma in situ (CIS),.

### **Routes of Spread**
1.  **Direct Spread:**
    *   **Supraglottic:** To vallecula, tongue base, pyriform fossa, and [[Pre-epiglottic space]].
    *   **Glottic:** To anterior commissure (then to opposite cord), arytenoid, or subglottis.
    *   **Subglottic:** To trachea, thyroid gland, and strap muscles via cricothyroid membrane.
    *   *Important:* The anterior commissure tendon (Broyle’s ligament) acts as a temporary barrier to spread.
2.  **Lymphatic Spread:** Frequency depends on the subsite (Supraglottic > Subglottic > Glottic).
3.  **Distant Metastasis:** To lungs (most common), liver, and bones.

### **Clinical Features**
Symptoms vary significantly by site.

#### **1. Glottic Cancer (Most Common)**
*   **Hoarseness:** Cardinal and earliest symptom. Persistent hoarseness >3 weeks in a smoker requires visualization,.
*   **Aphonia:** In advanced cases.
*   **Stridor/Airway Obstruction:** Late feature due to tumor bulk or cord fixation.

#### **2. Supraglottic Cancer**
*   **Silent initially:** Vague symptoms often ignored.
*   **Throat pain/Odynophagia:** Common presentation.
*   **Referred [[Otalgia]]:** Pain referred to the ear via the Vagus nerve,.
*   **Dysphagia:** Difficulty swallowing.
*   **Neck Mass:** Enlarged lymph nodes may be the first sign.
*   **Hot Potato Voice:** Muffled voice due to mass effect.

#### **3. Subglottic Cancer (Rare)**
*   **Stridor/Dyspnea:** Most common presenting symptom (airway obstruction).
*   **Hoarseness:** Late sign indicating upward spread to vocal cords.

### **Diagnostic Evaluation**
1.  **Clinical Examination:**
    *   **Indirect Laryngoscopy (IDL):** Visualization of cords, mobility, and pyriform fossa.
    *   **Neck Palpation:** Check for lymph nodes, broadening of laryngeal framework (**Laryngeal splaying**), tenderness (perichondritis), and loss of **Laryngeal Crepitus** (sign of post-cricoid involvement),,.
2.  **Endoscopy:**
    *   **Flexible Fiberoptic Laryngoscopy:** For detailed assessment of hidden areas (e.g., subglottis, ventricles).
    *   **Microlaryngoscopy ([[MLS]]):** Examination under microscope for mapping tumor extent.
3.  **Biopsy:** Mandatory for histological confirmation.
    *   **Supravital Staining:** Toluidine blue helps select biopsy sites in leukoplakia (stains malignant cells, not keratin),.
4.  **Imaging:**
    *   **[[CT Scan]] (Contrast Enhanced):** Assessing cartilage erosion (thyroid/cricoid), pre-epiglottic/paraglottic space invasion, and lymph node status,.
    *   **[[MRI]]:** Superior for soft tissue definition and detecting cartilage invasion,.
    *   **[[PET Scan]]:** To detect recurrence, residual disease, or distant metastasis.

### **TNM Staging (AJCC)**
*Simplified for exam preparation*,,,,.

**Primary Tumor (T)**

| Stage | **Supraglottis** | **Glottis** | **Subglottis** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **T1** | Limited to one subsite, normal mobility. | Limited to vocal cord(s), normal mobility. (T1a: one cord, T1b: both cords). | Limited to subglottis. |
| **T2** | Invades adjacent subsite(s) or glottis/outside supra-glottis. No fixation. | Extends to supra/subglottis. Impaired mobility. | Extends to vocal cords. Normal/impaired mobility. |
| **T3** | **Cord fixation** OR invades post-cricoid/pre-epiglottic space. | **Cord fixation** OR invades paraglottic space/inner thyroid cartilage. | **Cord fixation**. |
| **T4a** | Invades through thyroid cartilage or external tissues (trachea, strap muscles, thyroid). | Same as Supraglottis. | Same as Supraglottis. |
| **T4b** | Invades prevertebral space, carotid artery, or mediastinum. | Same as Supraglottis. | Same as Supraglottis. |

**Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**
*   **N0:** No nodes.
*   **N1:** Single ipsilateral node $\le$ 3 cm.
*   **N2:**
    *   **N2a:** Single ipsilateral >3 cm but $\le$ 6 cm.
    *   **N2b:** Multiple ipsilateral $\le$ 6 cm.
    *   **N2c:** Bilateral or contralateral $\le$ 6 cm.
*   **N3:** Node > 6 cm.

### **Management**
Treatment depends on the stage and site, focusing on "Organ Preservation" where possible.

#### **1. Early Stage (T1, T2)**
*   **Goal:** Cure with preservation of voice.
*   **[[Radiotherapy]] (RT):** Preferred for voice preservation. 90% cure rate for T1 glottic cancer,.
*   **Surgery:** **Transoral Laser Microsurgery ([[TLM]])** or **Conservation Laryngectomy** (e.g., vertical/horizontal partial laryngectomy). Used if RT fails or patient preference.

#### **2. Advanced Stage (T3)**
*   **Organ Preservation Protocol:** Concurrent Chemoradiation (Chemo + RT) is the standard of care to save the larynx,.
*   **Surgery:** If cartilage is destroyed or patient cannot tolerate Chemo-RT, **Total Laryngectomy** is performed.

#### **3. Advanced Stage (T4a)**
*   **Surgery:** **Total [[Laryngectomy]]** with neck dissection followed by post-operative Radiotherapy is the treatment of choice,.

#### **4. Metastatic/Unresectable (T4b)**
*   **Palliative:** Chemotherapy, Palliative RT, Tracheostomy for airway, Gastrostomy for feeding,.

#### **Management of Neck Nodes**
*   **N0 Neck:** Observation or selective neck dissection (if risk of occult metastasis >20%, e.g., supraglottic cancer).
*   **N+ Neck:** Modified Radical Neck Dissection (MRND) or Radical Neck Dissection (RND).

### **Special Condition: Verrucous Carcinoma**
*   **Defect:** Locally aggressive, low-grade malignancy (Ackerman tumor).
*   **Treatment:** **Surgery** (Wide excision/Hemilaryngectomy).
*   **Clinical Implication:** **Radiotherapy is CONTRAINDICATED** as it may induce anaplastic transformation,.

### **Rehabilitation After Total Laryngectomy**
Loss of voice is a major morbidity. Rehabilitation methods include,:
1.  **Esophageal Speech:** Swallowing air and burping it out (difficult to learn).
2.  **Electrolarynx (Artificial Larynx):** External vibrator placed on neck (robotic sound).
3.  **[[Tracheoesophageal Puncture]] (TEP):** Surgical fistula created between trachea and esophagus with a one-way valve (Blom-Singer valve). Best voice quality.
