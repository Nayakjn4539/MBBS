# [[Asphyxia]] > Physiology of Asphyxia

### Physiology of Asphyxia

**Definition**
Asphyxia is derived from the Greek word meaning "pulselessness". However, in forensic medicine, it is defined as a condition caused by interference with respiration, or due to lack of oxygen in respired air, resulting in failure of uptake of oxygen by tissues together with failure to eliminate carbon dioxide [[Asphyxia]]. It essentially leads to a state of **hypoxia** and **hypercapnia**.

#### Pathophysiology (The Vicious Cycle of Asphyxia)
The physiological changes occur in a cyclical manner leading to death.

1.  **Obstruction/Lack of Oxygen:** Interference with respiration leads to reduced oxygen tension in the blood.
2.  **Capillary Dilation:** The reduction in oxygen tension causes the capillaries to dilate.
3.  **Stasis:** Dilation leads to slowing of the blood stream (stasis) in capillaries and venules.
4.  **Congestion:** Stasis results in capillo-venous engorgement and accumulation of blood in the organs.
5.  **Reduced Venous Return:** Due to stasis in organs, the venous return to the heart diminishes.
6.  **Reduced Pulmonary Flow:** Consequently, blood output to the lungs decreases.
7.  **Deficient Oxygenation:** The blood in the lungs is not adequately oxygenated, further aggravating the initial hypoxia, completing the vicious cycle.

#### Phases of Mechanical Asphyxia
When air entry is completely prevented, the body undergoes three distinct physiological stages before death. The average fatal period is **3 to 5 minutes**.

| Stage | Duration | Physiological Changes | Clinical Signs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Stage of Dyspnea** | ~1 min | Accumulation of [[Carbon dioxide]] stimulates the respiratory center in the medulla. | • Rapid, deep breathing (Air hunger)<br>• Inspiratory effort is more marked<br>• Rise in blood pressure<br>• Slight [[Cyanosis]] |
| **2. Stage of Convulsions** | ~1 min | Cerebral hypoxia causes irritation of the brain. | • Violent expiratory efforts<br>• **Convulsions** (clonic and tonic)<br>• Petechial hemorrhages ([[Tardieu spots]]) develop due to increased venous pressure<br>• Loss of consciousness<br>• Relaxation of sphincters (voiding of urine/feces) |
| **3. Stage of Exhaustion (Apnea)** | ~1-2 mins | Paralysis of the respiratory center due to prolonged hypoxia. | • Breathing becomes shallow, gasping, and infrequent<br>• Complete loss of consciousness<br>• Muscles become flaccid<br>• Heart may continue to beat for 10–15 mins after respiration stops |

#### Classification of Anoxia
While mechanical asphyxia is the focus, the underlying physiology involves anoxia (lack of oxygen).
1.  **Anoxic Anoxia:** Defective oxygenation of blood in lungs (e.g., [[Hanging]], [[Strangulation]], Drowning).
2.  **Anemic Anoxia:** Reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of blood (e.g., [[Carbon monoxide poisoning]], Hemorrhage).
3.  **Stagnant Anoxia:** Inefficient circulation of blood (e.g., Shock, Heart failure, [[Traumatic asphyxia]]).
4.  **Histotoxic Anoxia:** Tissues are unable to utilize oxygen despite normal supply (e.g., [[Cyanide poisoning]]).

#### The "Classic" Asphyxial Triad
These are non-specific signs but are traditionally associated with the physiology of asphyxial deaths.

1.  **Cyanosis:**
    *   Bluish discoloration of skin and mucous membranes.
    *   Caused by an accumulation of **reduced hemoglobin** (>5 g/100 ml) in the capillary blood due to diminished oxygen tension.
    *   Most prominent in the lips, nail beds, and fingertips.

2.  **Petechial Hemorrhages ([[Tardieu spots]]):**
    *   Pinpoint hemorrhages caused by the acute rise in venous pressure obstructing venous return.
    *   This causes over-distention and rupture of thin-walled venules.
    *   They are **not** caused by hypoxia of the vessel wall itself.
    *   **Locations:** Conjunctiva, eyelids, face, sub-pleural (lungs), and sub-pericardial (heart).

3.  **Congestion and Fluidity of Blood:**
    *   Visceral congestion occurs due to venous stasis and right heart failure.
    *   Postmortem fluidity of blood is due to the release of fibrinolysins from the vessel walls in response to hypoxia.

#### Autopsy Findings (Pathological Physiology)
The physiological events manifest as specific findings during [[Medicolegal Autopsy]]:

*   **External:**
    *   **Cyanosis:** Especially on the face and nails.
    *   **Petechiae:** Seen on the face, forehead, and conjunctiva (especially in [[Throttling]] or [[Strangulation]]).
    *   **Postmortem Staining:** Usually dark/deep purple and develops early due to fluid blood.
*   **Internal:**
    *   **Blood:** Dark liquid blood (due to high CO2 and fibrinolysis).
    *   **Right Heart:** Distended/engorged with blood (due to pulmonary hypertension and venous stasis).
    *   **Lungs:** Congested, heavy, and edematous (pulmonary edema). Sub-pleural petechiae are common.
    *   **Brain:** Congested and edematous due to venous obstruction.

#### Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Non-Specificity:** The "Asphyxial Triad" is not pathognomonic of mechanical asphyxia. These signs can be seen in natural deaths (e.g., congestive heart failure) or other conditions.
*   **Diagnosis:** Diagnosis of asphyxia is often a diagnosis of exclusion or requires positive evidence of mechanical interference (e.g., ligature mark, hyoid fracture).
*   **Time of Death:** Breathing usually stops within **20 seconds** of cardiac arrest, but the heart may continue to beat for up to **20 minutes** after breathing stops. This physiological window is crucial for resuscitation.
