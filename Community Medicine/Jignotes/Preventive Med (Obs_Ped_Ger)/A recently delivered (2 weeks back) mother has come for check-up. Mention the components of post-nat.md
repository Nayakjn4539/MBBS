# [[PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IN OBSTETRICS, PAEDIATRICS AND GERIATRICS]] > A recently delivered (2 weeks back) mother has come for check-up. Mention the components of post-natal check-up. What might be the post-natal complications? What measures can be taken to improve post-natal care at community level?

### Post-Natal Care (PNC) Visit: 2 Weeks Post-Delivery

The care of the mother (and the newborn) after delivery is known as [[Postnatal Care]]. Ideally, a mother should be examined twice a day for the first 3 days, and subsequently, once a day till the umbilical cord drops off. A late postnatal examination is typically conducted at 6 weeks, but a visit at **2 weeks** is crucial for monitoring recovery.

#### 1. Components of Post-Natal Check-up

The objective is to ensure the rapid restoration of the mother to optimum health.

**A. History Taking**
*   **General well-being:** Sleep, appetite, and emotional state.
*   **Breastfeeding:** Adequacy of milk, problems with attachment, or pain.
*   **Complaints:** Fever, pain in the lower abdomen, foul-smelling discharge, or burning micturition.

**B. Physical Examination**
*   **General:** Check [[Vital Signs]] (Temperature, Pulse, Respiration) to rule out infection. Check for **Pallor** (Anaemia).
*   **Breasts:** Check for engagement, cracked nipples, or signs of [[Mastitis]].
*   **Abdomen:**
    *   Check for the **Involution of Uterus** (The uterus should not be palpable per abdomen by 2 weeks; if palpable, it indicates [[Subinvolution]]).
    *   Check abdominal muscle tone.
*   **Perineum/Genitalia:**
    *   **Lochia:** Check character, amount, and smell of [[Lochia]] (discharge). By week 2, it should be transitioning from *Lochia serosa* to *Lochia alba*. Foul smell indicates infection.
    *   **Perineum:** Check healing of stitches (episiotomy) or tears.

**C. Laboratory Investigations**
*   **Haemoglobin:** Routine Hb estimation to detect and treat **Anaemia**.
*   **Urine:** Routine analysis for albumin and sugar; culture if UTI is suspected.

**D. Advice and Counselling**
*   **Nutrition:** Diet rich in proteins, iron, and fluids. Continuation of [[Iron and Folic Acid]] (IFA) supplementation.
*   **Family Planning:** Motivation for spacing methods (e.g., Lactational Amenorrhea Method, Condoms, or Copper-T).
*   **Hygiene:** Personal and perineal hygiene.

#### 2. Post-Natal Complications

Complications can arise during the [[Puerperium]] (6-week period after birth) which require prompt recognition.

| **Complication** | **Description & Clinical Features** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Puerperal Sepsis]]** | Infection of the genital tract within 3 weeks after delivery. Characterized by fever, rapid pulse, foul-smelling lochia, and lower abdominal tenderness. |
| **[[Thrombophlebitis]]** | Infection of the leg veins. The leg may become tender, pale, and swollen (specifically *Phlegmasia alba dolens*). |
| **Secondary Haemorrhage** | Vaginal bleeding occurring anytime from **6 hours to 6 weeks** after delivery. Usually due to retained placenta or membranes (Common at the 2-week mark). |
| **Urinary Tract Infection** | Burning micturition, fever, and frequency. |
| **[[Mastitis]]** | Inflammation/infection of the breast tissue, often due to milk stasis or cracked nipples. |
| **Psychological Disorders** | **Postpartum Blues** (mild, transient), **Postpartum Depression**, or rarely **Postpartum Psychosis** (fear, insecurity, confusion). |
| **Late Complications** | Retroverted uterus, prolapse of uterus, subinvolution, and cervicitis. |

> **Mnemonic for Complications: "SIP TIPS"**
> *   **S**econdary Haemorrhage
> *   **I**nfection (UTI, Mastitis)
> *   **P**uerperal Sepsis
> *   **T**hrombophlebitis
> *   **I**nvolution issues (Subinvolution)
> *   **P**sychological issues
> *   **S**tructural issues (Prolapse, Retroversion)

#### 3. Measures to Improve Post-Natal Care at Community Level

In rural areas, improving PNC is vital to reduce [[Maternal Mortality Rate]] (MMR).

**1. Home Visits by Health Workers (Backbone of PNC)**
*   **ASHA/ANM Visits:** Ensure home visits are conducted as per the schedule under [[Home Based Newborn Care]] (HBNC).
    *   **Institutional Delivery:** 6 Visits (Day 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42).
    *   **Home Delivery:** 7 Visits (Day 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42).
*   Workers monitor the mother’s temperature, lochia, and breast health, and the baby’s weight and feeding.

**2. Training of Personnel**
*   **Train [[Dais]] (TBAs):** Traditional Birth Attendants must be trained in the **"5 Cleans"** (Clean hands, surface, blade, cord tie, cord stump) to prevent sepsis and tetanus.
*   **Identify Danger Signs:** Training community workers to recognize danger signals (heavy bleeding, fever, convulsions) and refer promptly to the [[First Referral Unit]] (FRU).

**3. Health Education and Social Measures**
*   **Nutrition:** Educate families on low-cost nutritious food to combat maternal malnutrition.
*   **Hygiene:** Promote personal and environmental sanitation.
*   **[[Family Planning]]:** Promote spacing methods (IUDs are ideal within the first week or at 6 weeks). Avoid combined oral pills during lactation (suppresses milk); use Progestogen-only pills (POP) or barrier methods.

**4. Nutritional Supplementation**
*   Distribution of **Iron and Folic Acid** to prevent/treat anaemia.
*   Distribution of **Calcium** and Vitamin A (for the infant via breastmilk).

**5. Incentivized Schemes**
*   Utilization of schemes like [[Janani Suraksha Yojana]] (JSY) which links cash assistance with antenatal, natal, and postnatal care to ensure follow-up.
