# Radical Treatment for Malaria

### **Concept and Definition**
Radical treatment refers to the **complete elimination** of the malaria parasite from the body to achieve a total cure. It involves two simultaneous goals:
1.  **Clinical Cure:** Elimination of erythrocytic (blood) stages to stop fever and symptoms.
2.  **Radical Cure:** Elimination of **exo-erythrocytic** (liver) stages, specifically the dormant [[hypnozoites]] in *P. vivax* and *P. ovale*, to prevent **relapses**. It also includes gametocytocidal action to interrupt transmission,.

> **Note:** Relapses are specific to [[Plasmodium vivax]] and [[Plasmodium ovale]] due to the persistence of hypnozoites in the liver,.

### **Drug Regimens (As per National Framework/NVBDCP)**

The treatment protocol depends on the species of the parasite diagnosed.

#### **1. Radical Treatment for _Plasmodium vivax_**
This regimen targets both the blood stage (to cure symptoms) and the liver stage (to prevent relapse).

| Drug | Dosage | Duration | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Chloroquine** | 25 mg/kg body weight (divided dose) | 3 Days | Kills blood schizonts (Clinical Cure), |
| **[[Primaquine]]** | **0.25 mg/kg** body weight daily | **14 Days** | Kills liver hypnozoites (Radical Cure),, |

*   **Supervision:** The 14-day regimen of Primaquine should ideally be given under supervision to ensure compliance.

#### **2. Radical Treatment for _Plasmodium falciparum_**
While *P. falciparum* does not have a relapse phase (no hypnozoites), radical treatment here focuses on killing **gametocytes** to prevent the spread of infection to mosquitoes.

| Drug | Dosage | Duration | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT)]]** | **ACT-AL** (North East India) <br> **ACT-SP** (Rest of India) | 3 Days | Rapidly clears blood parasites, |
| **[[Primaquine]]** | **0.75 mg/kg** body weight | **Single Dose** on Day 2 | Gametocytocidal action (Breaks transmission chain), |

*   **ACT-AL:** Artemether + Lumefantrine.
*   **ACT-SP:** Artesunate + Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine.

### **3. Mixed Infections (_P. vivax_ + _P. falciparum_)**
These cases should be treated as **Falciparum malaria** with full course of ACT, **PLUS** the 14-day course of Primaquine to clear *P. vivax* hypnozoites.
*   **Regimen:** ACT (3 days) + Primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for **14 days**),.

### **Clinical Relevance & Contraindications**

**[[Primaquine]]** is the game-changer for radical cure, but it comes with strict warnings:

*   **Contraindications (Do NOT give Primaquine to):**
    1.  **Pregnant Women:** Can cause hemolysis in the fetus,.
    2.  **Infants:** Children under 1 year of age,.
    3.  **G6PD Deficiency:** Patients with Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency are at high risk of severe hemolysis (destruction of RBCs),.

*   **Stop Signs:** Instruct patients to stop Primaquine immediately if they notice:
    *   Dark colored urine (Coca-cola colored).
    *   Yellow conjunctiva (Jaundice).
    *   Bluish discoloration of lips (Cyanosis),.

---

### **Treatment in Pregnancy**
Since Primaquine is contraindicated:
*   **P. vivax:** Treat with **Chloroquine** only. Weekly chemoprophylaxis (suppressive treatment) with Chloroquine may be continued until delivery, after which radical cure with Primaquine can be given,.
*   **P. falciparum:**
    *   *1st Trimester:* **Quinine** salt,.
    *   *2nd & 3rd Trimester:* **ACT** (Note: Primaquine is omitted),.

### **Memory Aids (Mnemonics)** 🧠

**1. To remember Contraindications for Primaquine:**
**"PIG"**
*   **P** - **P**regnant women
*   **I** - **I**nfants (<1 year)
*   **G** - **G**6PD deficiency

**2. To remember the purpose of Radical Treatment:**
**"Root out the Relapse"**
*   Radical = Root (kills the root cause in the liver).
*   Prevents the **Return** (Relapse) of the fever.
