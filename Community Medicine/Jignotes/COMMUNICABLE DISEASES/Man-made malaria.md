# Man-Made Malaria

### Definition
**Man-made malaria** refers to the incidence or increase of malaria consequent to human undertakings and interference with natural ecosystems. It occurs when developmental activities create favorable conditions for the breeding of mosquitoes (vectors), leading to disease transmission.

This concept highlights that malaria is not just a natural disaster but often a result of **poor environmental management** during development projects.

### Common Causes and Breeding Sites
Human activities create "ecological niches" for mosquitoes. Common sources include:

*   **Engineering Projects:** Construction of roads, bridges, and dams often leaves behind **burrow pits** (dug to extract earth) which fill with rainwater and become breeding grounds.
*   **Irrigation Systems:** Seepage from irrigation channels, garden pools, and artificial lakes create stagnant water suitable for vector breeding.
*   **Urbanization:** Unplanned urbanization, proliferation of slums, and lack of drainage lead to water stagnation.
*   **Water Storage Practices:** In urban areas, man-made containers like **overhead tanks**, underground cisterns, water coolers, and flower vases are major breeding sources.

### Vectors Involved
Different vectors adapt to these man-made environments:

| Vector Species | Habitat/Breeding Source | Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Anopheles stephensi]]** | Wells, cisterns, overhead tanks, fountains, roof gutters. | **Urban Malaria** |
| **[[Anopheles culicifacies]]** | Irrigation channels, rainwater pools, burrow pits. | **Rural/Peri-urban Malaria** |
| **[[Anopheles sundaicus]]** | Brackish water (sometimes created by embankments blocking tidal flow). | Coastal areas |

### Specific Paradigms of Man-Made Malaria

#### 1. Urban Malaria
*   **Vector:** Primarily *[[Anopheles stephensi]]*.
*   **Cause:** Strictly man-made breeding sites like stored water in construction sites, tyers, and domestic containers.
*   **Aggravating Factor:** Influx of migrant labor from malarious zones into cities for construction work introduces the parasite to the vector population.

#### 2. Malaria in Project Areas
*   **Scenario:** Temporary aggregation of laborers for huge projects (dams, industries).
*   **Risk:** Tropical aggregation of labor brings non-immune populations into contact with different parasite strains.
*   **Outcome:** Sudden explosive epidemics due to disturbance of the ecosystem and creation of new breeding places.

### Mnemonic: **"BUILD"**
To remember the causes of Man-Made Malaria:

*   **B** - **B**urrow pits (road/railway construction)
*   **U** - **U**nplanned Urbanization (slums/drainage)
*   **I** - **I**rrigation channels (seepage)
*   **L** - **L**abor migration (Project areas)
*   **D** - **D**omestic water storage (Tanks/Coolers)

### Prevention and Control Strategies
Control of man-made malaria relies heavily on **[[Integrated Vector Management]]** and legislative measures rather than just chemical sprays.

1.  **Source Reduction (Environmental Manipulation):**
    *   **Filling and levelling** of burrow pits and ditches.
    *   **Intermittent irrigation** to prevent stagnation.
    *   **Proper drainage** systems in urban areas.

2.  **Legislative Measures (Civic Bye-laws):**
    *   Implementation of **building bye-laws** to prevent mosquito breeding in construction sites.
    *   Mandatory **mosquito-proofing** of overhead tanks and wells (e.g., proper lids, wire mesh).
    *   Prohibition of water collection in scrap (tires, bottles).

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Use of **[[Larvivorous fish]]** (*Gambusia* or *Poecilia*) in ornamental tanks and fountains.

### Clinical Relevance: Induced Malaria
*Note: While "Man-made malaria" usually refers to ecological factors, **[[Induced Malaria]]** is another form of human-caused transmission.*
*   **Definition:** Direct inoculation of parasites into the blood.
*   **Causes:** Blood transfusion, organ transplant, or sharing needles (drug addicts).
*   **Key Difference:** There is **no pre-erythrocytic (liver) stage**; therefore, relapse does not occur, and radical treatment with Primaquine is not required.
