# [[Spine]] > Cervical Spine Injuries

### Cervical Spine Injuries

Injuries to the [[cervical spine]] are potentially life-threatening and disabling due to the proximity of the [[spinal cord]] and the [[vertebral arteries]]. A high index of suspicion is essential in all trauma patients, especially those with head injuries or unconsciousness.

---

### 1. Applied Anatomy and Biomechanics

The cervical spine consists of 7 vertebrae. It is divided into two distinct functional units:
1.  **Upper Cervical Spine (C1-C2):** The Atlas (C1) and Axis (C2). Specialized for rotation.
2.  **Subaxial Spine (C3-C7):** Similar to thoracic/lumbar vertebrae but smaller with transverse foramina.

**Stability:** Depends on the integrity of the [[anterior column]], [[middle column]], and [[posterior column]] (Denis Concept).
*   **Mechanisms of Injury:** Usually indirect force.
    *   **Flexion:** Most common.
    *   **Extension:** e.g., Whiplash.
    *   **Axial Compression:** e.g., Diving accidents.
    *   **Rotation:** e.g., Fracture-dislocations.

**Clinical Implication:** Any patient with a head injury or blunt trauma above the clavicle must be assumed to have a cervical spine injury until proven otherwise.

### 2. Clinical Assessment

#### History
*   **Mechanism:** Fall from height, diving into shallow water, Road Traffic Accident (RTA).
*   **Symptoms:** Neck pain, stiffness, paresthesia, weakness in limbs.

#### Physical Examination
*   **Pre-requisite:** Immobilize the neck (manual in-line stabilization or collar) before touching the patient. Do not extend the neck.
*   **Look:** Deformity, bruising, open wounds.
*   **Feel:** Palpate spinous processes for tenderness, steps/gaps (indicating ligament rupture), or muscle spasm,.
*   **Move:** **Contraindicated** until fracture is excluded radiologically.

#### Neurological Examination
A complete assessment is mandatory to detect [[spinal cord injury]] or [[nerve root]] damage.
*   **Motor:** Test myotomes (C5-T1).
*   **Sensory:** Test dermatomes.
*   **Reflexes:** Deep tendon reflexes and superficial reflexes (bulbocavernosus, anal wink).

| Nerve Root | Motor Function | Reflex |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **C5** | Shoulder Abduction (Deltoid) | Biceps |
| **C6** | Wrist Extension | Brachioradialis |
| **C7** | Elbow Extension (Triceps) | Triceps |
| **C8** | Finger Flexion | - |
| **T1** | Finger Abduction | - |

### 3. Diagnostic Imaging

#### X-rays (Radiographs)
Mandatory for all trauma patients with neck pain or unconsciousness.
*   **Views:** Anteroposterior (AP), Lateral, and Open-mouth (Odontoid) view.
*   **Systematic Reading of Lateral View (ABCS):**
    1.  **A**lignment: Check 4 parallel lines (Anterior vertebral line, Posterior vertebral line, Spinolaminar line, Spinous process tips).
    2.  **B**ones: Outline of vertebral bodies.
    3.  **C**artilage/Disc spaces.
    4.  **S**oft tissue: Prevertebral shadow width (<5mm above trachea, <1 vertebral width below).
    *   *Note:* C7-T1 junction must be visible. If obscured by shoulders, use Swimmer's view or CT.

#### Advanced Imaging
*   **[[Computed Tomography]] (CT):** Gold standard for bony architecture. Indicated if X-rays are inadequate or fracture is suspected.
*   **[[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI):** Best for soft tissues (ligaments, discs) and [[spinal cord]] evaluation (edema, hemorrhage, compression).

### 4. Upper Cervical Spine Injuries (C1-C2)

#### A. Jefferson Fracture (C1 Burst Fracture)
*   **Mechanism:** Vertical compression (Axial loading) e.g., heavy object falling on head or diving.
*   **Pathology:** "Bursting" of the ring of the [[atlas]] (C1). The lateral masses spread outward,.
*   **Neurology:** Usually intact because the canal widens, sparing the cord.
*   **Diagnosis:** Open-mouth X-ray shows lateral overhang of C1 masses over C2.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Stable: Halo vest or Minerva jacket.
    *   Unstable (Transverse ligament rupture): C1-C2 Fusion.

#### B. Odontoid Fractures (Fracture of Dens)
Fractures of the [[odontoid process]] of the [[axis]] (C2).
*   **Classification (Anderson and D'Alonzo):**
    *   **Type I:** Avulsion of the tip (Rare, Stable).
    *   **Type II:** Fracture at the junction of the dens and body (Most common, Unstable, High risk of [[non-union]] due to poor blood supply).
    *   **Type III:** Fracture extends into the body of C2 (Stable, heals well due to cancellous bone),.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Type I & III: Halo vest/Collar.
    *   Type II: Anterior screw fixation or Posterior C1-C2 fusion.

#### C. Hangman's Fracture (Traumatic Spondylolisthesis of C2)
*   **Definition:** Bilateral fracture of the [[pars interarticularis]] (pedicles) of C2.
*   **Mechanism:** Hyperextension + Distraction (e.g., hanging, chin hitting dashboard in RTA).
*   **Pathology:** The body of C2 displaces anteriorly over C3.
*   **Neurology:** Paradoxically, cord damage is rare because the canal widens.
*   **Treatment:** Reduction and Halo vest immobilization or surgery if unstable.

### 5. Subaxial Cervical Spine Injuries (C3-C7)

#### A. Wedge Compression Fracture
*   **Mechanism:** Flexion injury.
*   **Pathology:** Compression of the anterior column. Middle/Posterior columns intact.
*   **Stability:** Stable.
*   **Treatment:** Cervical collar.

#### B. Burst Fracture
*   **Mechanism:** Axial compression.
*   **Pathology:** Vertebral body crushed; fragments may retropulse into the spinal canal.
*   **Stability:** Unstable (Anterior + Middle columns involved).
*   **Treatment:** Surgical decompression and stabilization.

#### C. Flexion-Rotation Injuries (Facet Dislocations)
*   **Unilateral Facet Dislocation:**
    *   Mechanism: Flexion + Rotation.
    *   X-ray: Vertebral body displaced <50% anteriorly.
    *   Stable.
*   **Bilateral Facet Dislocation:**
    *   Mechanism: Severe flexion.
    *   X-ray: Vertebral body displaced >50% anteriorly.
    *   Highly Unstable with high risk of cord injury.
    *   **Treatment:** Reduction (traction) followed by stabilization.

#### D. Clay Shoveler’s Fracture
*   **Definition:** Avulsion fracture of the [[spinous process]] (usually C7 or T1).
*   **Mechanism:** Sudden muscle contraction (shoveling) or direct blow.
*   **Stability:** Stable.
*   **Treatment:** Symptomatic (Collar, analgesics).

#### E. Whiplash Injury
*   **Mechanism:** Sudden hyperextension followed by flexion (e.g., rear-end collision).
*   **Pathology:** Soft tissue injury (ligaments/muscles) without fracture.
*   **Symptoms:** Neck pain, stiffness, headache.
*   **Treatment:** Soft collar (short term), analgesics, early mobilization.

### 6. Management Protocols

#### Emergency Care (Pre-hospital & ER)
1.  **Immobilization:** Hard cervical collar, sandbags, taping to spine board.
2.  **ABCDE:** Maintain airway (jaw thrust, avoid neck extension), breathing, circulation.
3.  **Log-rolling:** To examine the back without twisting the spine.

#### Definitive Treatment
*   **Conservative:**
    *   **Collars:** Soft (symptomatic) vs. Hard (Philadelphia/Miami J) for stable fractures.
    *   **Traction:** Skull traction (Crutchfield or Gardner-Wells tongs) to reduce dislocations.
    *   **Halo Vest:** Provides rigid external immobilization allows patient mobility.
*   **Surgical:**
    *   **Indications:** Unstable fractures, progressive neurological deficit, irreducible dislocations, spinal cord compression,.
    *   **Approaches:** Anterior (decompression/fusion/plating) or Posterior (wiring/screws/rods).

### 7. Complications

1.  **Neurological Deficit:** [[Quadriplegia]] (Tetraplegia) or incomplete cord syndromes.
2.  **Respiratory Failure:** Injury above C4 affects the phrenic nerve (diaphragm).
3.  **Spinal Shock:** Temporary loss of all reflex activity below the injury.
4.  **Pressure Sores:** Due to immobility and sensory loss.
5.  **DVT/Pulmonary Embolism.**

### Summary Mnemonic
**C-3-4-5** keep the diaphragm alive!
(Injury above C3 causes respiratory arrest due to phrenic nerve paralysis).
