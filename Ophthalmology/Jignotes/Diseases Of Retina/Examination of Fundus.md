# [[Diseases Of Retina]] > Examination of Fundus

### **Examination of Fundus (Ophthalmoscopy)**

The examination of the fundus is a critical clinical skill used to visualize the posterior segment of the eye, including the [[vitreous]], [[optic disc]], [[retina]], and [[choroid]]. It is essential for diagnosing diseases of the retina and optic nerve, as well as systemic diseases like hypertension and diabetes.

### **Prerequisites for Examination**
To ensure a thorough examination, the pupils should ideally be dilated (mydriasis).
*   **Drugs used:** 1% [[Tropicamide]] and/or 2.5-5% [[Phenylephrine]] eye drops.
*   **Precaution:** Rule out shallow anterior chamber to prevent precipitating [[angle-closure glaucoma]] before dilating.

### **Methods and Equipment**

The routine of ophthalmoscopic examination typically follows this sequence: Distant Direct $\rightarrow$ Direct $\rightarrow$ Indirect $\rightarrow$ Slit-lamp Biomicroscopy.

#### **1. Distant Direct Ophthalmoscopy**
*   **Equipment:** Plain mirror with a central hole or a self-illuminated [[direct ophthalmoscope]] set at 0 diopters,.
*   **Technique:** Light is thrown into the patient's eye from a distance of 20-25 cm (arm's length) in a semi-dark room.
*   **Findings/Utility:**
    *   **Red Reflex:** Assesses the clarity of media. A uniform reddish glow is normal.
    *   **Opacities:** Appear as black shadows against the red glow (e.g., [[cataract]], vitreous hemorrhage).
    *   **Parallactic Displacement:** Helps localize opacities. If the patient moves the eye up and the opacity moves up, it is anterior to the pupillary plane (e.g., cornea); if it moves down, it is posterior (e.g., vitreous).
    *   **Detachment/Tumor:** A greyish reflex may indicate [[retinal detachment]] or a tumor.

#### **2. Direct Ophthalmoscopy**
*   **Equipment:** Hand-held, battery-operated [[direct ophthalmoscope]]. It has a system of lenses to focus on the retina.
*   **Optics:**
    *   Produces an **Erect** and **Virtual** image.
    *   **Magnification:** Approximately **15x** in emmetropes (more in myopes, less in hypermetropes),.
    *   **Field of View:** Small, about **2 Disc Diameters (DD)** or 10 degrees,.
*   **Technique:**
    *   The examiner uses their right eye to examine the patient's right eye and vice versa.
    *   The instrument is brought very close to the patient's eye.
*   **Utility:** Best for examining the **central fundus**, specifically the fine details of the [[optic disc]] and [[macula]]. It lacks depth perception (monocular).

#### **3. Indirect Ophthalmoscopy (IDO)**
*   **Equipment:** Binocular indirect ophthalmoscope (headset) and a condensing lens (commonly **+20D**).
*   **Optics:**
    *   Produces an **Inverted** (vertically and laterally) and **Real** image formed between the lens and the observer,.
    *   **Magnification:** Varies with the lens used. A +20D lens provides approx **3x to 5x** magnification,. (Higher power lens = Lower mag but wider field).
    *   **Field of View:** Large, about **8 DD** (approx 35-45 degrees),.
*   **Technique:**
    *   Performed at arm's length.
    *   **Scleral Indentation:** Can be used to visualize the extreme periphery (ora serrata),.
*   **Utility:** Essential for [[retinal detachment]], peripheral retinal lesions, and examination through hazy media (e.g., dense cataract, vitreous hemorrhage) due to the bright illumination source,. Provides **stereopsis** (depth perception).

#### **4. Slit-Lamp Biomicroscopy (Indirect)**
*   **Equipment:** [[Slit lamp]] combined with auxiliary lenses.
    *   **Non-contact lenses:** **+90D** or **+78D** (most common). Produces an inverted, real image.
    *   **Contact lenses:** **Goldmann 3-mirror contact lens** (visualizes periphery via mirrors) or **Mainster lens**,.
*   **Utility:** Provides a highly magnified, stereoscopic view of the posterior pole. It is the gold standard for evaluating [[diabetic macular edema]] and [[glaucomatous cupping]].

### **Comparison: Direct vs. Indirect Ophthalmoscopy**

| Feature | Direct Ophthalmoscopy | Indirect Ophthalmoscopy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Image Type** | Virtual, Erect | Real, Inverted (vertically & laterally) |
| **Magnification** | High (~15x) | Low to Moderate (~3-5x with +20D) |
| **Field of View** | Small (~2 DD / 10°) | Large (~8 DD / 45°) |
| **Stereopsis (Depth)** | Absent (Monocular) | Present (Binocular) |
| **Working Distance** | Very close to patient | Arm's length |
| **View in Hazy Media** | Poor | Good (due to bright light) |
| **Area Visualized** | Central fundus (Disc/Macula) | Peripheral retina (up to ora serrata) |
| **Condensing Lens** | Not required | Required (+20D, +14D, etc.) |

### **Systematic Findings in Fundus Examination**

A systematic approach is required: Media $\rightarrow$ Disc $\rightarrow$ Vessels $\rightarrow$ Macula $\rightarrow$ Background.

#### **1. Media**
*   **Normal:** Transparent.
*   **Abnormal:** Opacities appear black against the red reflex (e.g., [[cataract]], [[vitreous hemorrhage]], [[vitreous opacities]]).

#### **2. Optic Disc (Optic Nerve Head)**
*   **Size:** Approx 1.5 mm diameter.
*   **Shape:** Vertically oval.
*   **Color:** Pinkish (due to capillaries).
    *   **Pale/Chalky white:** Indicates [[optic atrophy]].
    *   **Hyperemic (Red):** Indicates [[papillitis]] or [[papilledema]].
    *   **Yellow-waxy:** Seen in [[retinitis pigmentosa]] (consecutive optic atrophy).
*   **Margins:** Should be well-defined. Blurred margins seen in papilledema, papillitis, or drusen.
*   **Cup-Disc Ratio (CDR):** Normal is 0.3-0.4. Increased cupping (>0.6) or asymmetry (>0.2) suggests [[glaucoma]].
*   **Neovascularization (NVD):** New vessels at the disc seen in proliferative [[diabetic retinopathy]].

#### **3. Retinal Blood Vessels**
*   **Arteries vs. Veins:** Arteries are brighter red and narrower. Veins are darker and wider.
*   **A:V Ratio:** Normal is **2:3**.
    *   **Hypertensive Retinopathy:** Arteriolar attenuation leads to A:V ratio of 1:3 or 1:4.
*   **Crossings:** Normal crossings show no compression. Pathological A-V nicking (Gunn sign, Salus sign) is seen in [[hypertension]].
*   **Pulsations:**
    *   **Venous:** Spontaneous venous pulsation is visible in ~80% of normal people. Loss of SVP is an early sign of [[papilledema]].
    *   **Arterial:** Always pathological (seen in glaucoma, aortic regurgitation).

#### **4. Macula**
*   Located temporal to the disc. Darker than surrounding retina.
*   **Foveal Reflex:** A bright point of light at the center (foveola), prominent in young people. Loss of reflex occurs in [[macular edema]] or [[macular hole]].
*   **Cherry Red Spot:** Seen in [[central retinal artery occlusion]] (CRAO), Tay-Sachs disease, and Berlin's edema (commotio retinae).
*   **Hard Exudates:** Yellowish lipid deposits (e.g., Circinate pattern in diabetic maculopathy).
*   **Drusen:** Yellowish deposits seen in [[Age-Related Macular Degeneration]] (ARMD).

#### **5. General Background & Periphery**
*   **Color:** Orange-red (varies with race/pigmentation). "Tessellated" or "Tigroid" appearance is seen in high [[myopia]] due to visibility of choroidal vessels.
*   **Hemorrhages:**
    *   **Superficial:** Flame-shaped (nerve fiber layer) - e.g., Hypertension, venous occlusion.
    *   **Deep:** Dot and blot (inner nuclear layer) - e.g., Diabetic retinopathy.
    *   **Preretinal/Subhyaloid:** Boat-shaped (fluid level).
*   **Cotton Wool Spots:** Soft exudates representing nerve fiber layer infarcts (ischemia).
*   **Retinal Detachment:** Retina appears grey, raised, and folded; blood vessels appear dark and tortuous.
*   **Pigmentation:** Bone-spicule pigmentation in the mid-periphery is pathognomonic for [[Retinitis Pigmentosa]].

### **Advanced/Ancillary Evaluation Methods**

While clinical examination is primary, these imaging techniques confirm findings:

1.  **Fundus Fluorescein Angiography ([[FFA]]):** Uses sodium fluorescein dye to visualize retinal vasculature. Essential for detecting leakage (e.g., DR, CSR), blockage (hemorrhage), or ischemia (CNP areas),.
2.  **Indocyanine Green Angiography ([[ICGA]]):** Uses infrared light to visualize **choroidal** circulation (better for [[CNVM]] in ARMD),.
3.  **Optical Coherence Tomography ([[OCT]]):** Non-invasive cross-sectional imaging (optical biopsy). Gold standard for macular hole, edema, and layers of the retina,.
4.  **B-Scan Ultrasonography ([[USG]]):** Essential when media is hazy (e.g., mature cataract, dense vitreous hemorrhage) to rule out RD or tumors,.
