# [[Lagophthalmos]]

### Definition
**Lagophthalmos** is defined as the inability to voluntarily close the eyelids completely. It is a condition characterized by incomplete closure of the palpebral aperture.

### Etiology and Classification
The causes of lagophthalmos can be classified based on the underlying mechanism:

| Type/Mechanism | Causes |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Neurogenic** | • **[[Facial nerve palsy]] (CN VII)**: Paralysis of the [[orbicularis oculi]] muscle (the sphincter of the eye) is the most common cause. <br>• Causes include Bell’s palsy, trauma, [[Leprosy]], and pontine tumors,. |
| **Mechanical** | • **Proptosis/[[Exophthalmos]]**: Extreme forward displacement of the globe (e.g., [[Thyroid Eye Disease]], orbital tumors) prevents lid closure. <br>• **Lid Retraction**: Upper lid retraction in thyrotoxicosis. |
| **Cicatricial** | • Scarring and contraction of the lids preventing closure. <br>• Seen in chemical/thermal burns, [[Symblepharon]], [[Stevens-Johnson syndrome]], and ocular pemphigoid. |
| **Iatrogenic (Surgical)** | • Following over-resection of the [[levator palpebrae superioris]] (LPS) muscle during ptosis surgery. <br>• Excessive skin removal during blepharoplasty. |
| **Structural** | • Severe [[Ectropion]]: Outward turning of the lid margin makes closure impossible. <br>• [[Buphthalmos]]: Enlarged eyeball in congenital glaucoma. |
| **Physiological** | • **Nocturnal Lagophthalmos**: Some healthy individuals sleep with their eyes partially open. |
| **Systemic/General** | • **Coma**: Comatosed patients lose the blink reflex and muscle tone required for closure. |

**Clinical Implication:** In patients with **[[Leprosy]]**, lagophthalmos is a common ocular lesion due to facial nerve involvement, leading to exposure keratitis.

### Pathophysiology
The primary issue in lagophthalmos is the loss of the protective mechanism of blinking and lid closure.
1.  **Exposure:** The cornea and conjunctiva are exposed to air continuously.
2.  **Desiccation:** Evaporation of the tear film leads to drying of the corneal epithelium.
3.  **Epithelial Damage:** Epithelium is cast off (desquamation).
4.  **Infection:** The denuded surface becomes prone to invasion by infective organisms.
5.  **Ulceration:** This sequence leads to **[[Exposure Keratopathy]]** (Keratitis Lagophthalmos),.

### Clinical Features
#### Symptoms
*   **Foreign body sensation**.
*   **Watering (Epiphora)**: Reflex hypersecretion due to dryness.
*   **Redness** and ocular irritation.
*   **Pain:** Present if corneal ulceration develops.
*   **Morning symptoms:** Symptoms are typically worse upon waking due to drying during sleep.

#### Signs
*   **Incomplete Closure:** Visible gap between upper and lower lid margins on attempted closure.
*   **Widened Palpebral Fissure:** Vertically wide aperture.
*   **Conjunctival Signs:** Congestion (redness), dryness (xerosis), and keratinization,.
*   **Corneal Signs ([[Exposure Keratopathy]]):**
    *   Loss of luster/sheen.
    *   **Punctate Epithelial Erosions (PEEs):** Typically seen in the lower one-third of the cornea or as a horizontal band in the palpebral fissure area.
    *   **[[Corneal Ulcer]]**: Can progress to perforation if neglected.
*   **Bell's Phenomenon:** The upward rolling of the eyeball during attempted closure. If Bell's phenomenon is *poor* or *absent*, the risk of corneal damage is significantly higher.

### Complications
If left untreated, lagophthalmos leads to serious sequelae,:
1.  **Conjunctival and Corneal [[Xerosis]]** (Dryness).
2.  **[[Exposure Keratitis]]**: Infection and inflammation of the cornea.
3.  **Corneal Ulceration**: May lead to perforation and loss of the eye.
4.  **Visual Impairment**: Due to corneal scarring (opacity).

### Management
The goal of treatment is to prevent exposure keratitis and treat the underlying cause.

#### 1. Prophylaxis (Preventing Exposure Keratitis)
*   **Artificial Tears:** Frequent instillation of lubricating drops (e.g., methylcellulose) during the day to keep the eye moist.
*   **Antibiotic Eye Ointment:** Applied copiously at bedtime to provide a barrier against evaporation and prevent infection.
*   **Lid Taping:** Strapping the lids closed with adhesive tape (micropore) during sleep.
*   **Bandage [[Contact Lens]]:** Soft contact lenses can protect the cornea and retain moisture.
*   **Moist Chamber:** Using goggles or plastic shields to reduce evaporation.

#### 2. Definitive/Surgical Management
If the condition is non-resolving or severe, surgical intervention is required.

**A. Tarsorrhaphy**
This creates an adhesion between the upper and lower lid margins to narrow or close the palpebral fissure.

| Type | Indications | Technique |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Temporary [[Tarsorrhaphy]]** | • Facial nerve palsy expected to recover.<br>• To assist healing of indolent corneal ulcers.<br>• During healing of skin grafts. | **Paramedian:** Sutures passed through the grey line of opposing lid margins using bolsters to keep them closed. |
| **Permanent [[Tarsorrhaphy]]** | • Permanent CN VII palsy.<br>• Established neuroparalytic keratitis. | **Lateral:** Triangular flaps of skin and tarsoconjunctiva are excised and sutured to create a permanent adhesion at the lateral canthus. |

**B. Other Surgical Options**
*   **Correction of Ectropion/Symblepharon:** If these are the cause.
*   **Levator Recession:** For lid retraction in thyroid eye disease.
*   **Lid Loading:** Gold weight implantation in the upper lid (for paralytic lagophthalmos).
*   **Orbital Decompression:** For severe proptosis.

**Clinical Note:** In comatose patients (e.g., ICU settings), prophylactic antibiotic ointment and lid taping are crucial to prevent sight-threatening exposure keratopathy.
