# [[PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IN OBSTETRICS, PAEDIATRICS AND GERIATRICS]] > Health problems of Geriatric population

### Health Problems of the Aged

The health problems of the [[Geriatric Population]] are multifaceted, involving a complex interaction of physical, mental, and social factors. Old age is not a disease in itself, but a normal biological phenomenon (senescence). The problems can be broadly classified into four major categories:

#### 1. Problems Due to the Ageing Process (Physiological)
These are disabilities arising from the natural deterioration of biological efficiency.
*   **Sensory Impairment:**
    *   **Vision:** [[Senile Cataract]] and **Glaucoma** are extremely common, leading to visual impairment.
    *   **Hearing:** **Nerve deafness** affects communication and social interaction.
*   **Musculoskeletal Changes:**
    *   **Osteoporosis:** Bones become brittle due to decalcification, affecting mobility and increasing fracture risk.
*   **Respiratory Changes:**
    *   **Emphysema:** Loss of lung elasticity reduces respiratory efficiency.
*   **Others:**
    *   Failure of special senses (smell, taste).
    *   Changes in mental outlook and reflexes.

#### 2. Problems Associated with Long-term Illness (Pathological)
Chronic diseases are more frequent in the elderly due to degenerative changes.
*   **Cardiovascular Diseases (CVS):**
    *   Degenerative diseases like **Atherosclerosis** and [[Hypertension]] are major causes of morbidity.
    *   Lead to complications like **Ischaemic Heart Disease (IHD)** and Stroke.
*   **Cancer:**
    *   The risk increases past middle age.
    *   Common sites: Prostate (men), Cervix/Breast (women).
*   **Accidents:**
    *   Accidents are a major health problem, often occurring **at home** (falls).
    *   **Fracture neck of femur** is a very common geriatric orthopedic problem due to fragile bones.
*   **Diabetes:**
    *   A leading cause of death; about **75% of diabetics** are over 50 years of age.
*   **Diseases of Locomotor System:**
    *   Cause maximum discomfort and disability.
    *   Includes: **Osteoarthritis**, Rheumatoid arthritis, Gout, Fibrositis, Spondylitis.
*   **Genito-Urinary System:**
    *   **Enlargement of prostate** (BPH), dysuria, frequency, and urgency of micturition are common complaints.
*   **Respiratory Illnesses:**
    *   Chronic bronchitis and asthma.

#### 3. Psychological Problems
Mental changes are often an inevitable accompaniment of old age, exacerbated by social isolation.
*   **Mental Changes:** Impaired memory, rigidity of outlook, and dislike of change.
*   **Sexual Adjustment:**
    *   **Menopause** in women.
    *   Diminution of sexual activity in men can lead to irritability, jealousy, and despondency.
*   **Emotional Disorders:**
    *   Result from social maladjustment.
    *   Include bitterness, inner withdrawal, **depression**, and even suicide.
    *   **Senile Dementia** and Alzheimer's disease are significant concerns.

#### 4. Social and Economic Problems
These are often termed "Sociomedical" problems.
*   **Economic:** Reduced income after retirement leads to a fall in the standard of living and poverty.
*   **Social Isolation:**
    *   Loss of status, loss of spouse (bereavement), and the "Empty Nest" syndrome.
    *   Breakdown of the **Joint Family system** and emergence of nuclear families leave the elderly lonely.
    *   **Generation Gap:** Maladjustment with the younger generation.

#### 5. Nutritional Problems
*   **Iron deficiency anemia:** Due to poor absorption or intake.
*   **Vitamin deficiencies:** Often due to dietary restrictions or neglect.
*   **Obesity:** Or conversely, undernutrition due to neglect.

### Mnemonic
**"ACID FALLS"** (Common Geriatric Pathologies)
*   **A** - **A**rthritis / **A**therosclerosis
*   **C** - **C**ancer / **C**ataract
*   **I** - **I**solation (Social) / **I**ncontinence
*   **D** - **D**iabetes / **D**eafness / **D**ementia
*   **F** - **F**alls (Accidents)
*   **A** - **A**nemia
*   **L** - **L**oneliness (Depression)
*   **L** - **L**ocomotor problems
*   **S** - **S**enile changes (Physiological)

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Multiple Pathology:** Elderly patients often present with multiple co-existing diseases (multimorbidity), complicating diagnosis and treatment.
*   **Polypharmacy:** Due to multiple ailments, the elderly consume a large percentage of drugs, increasing the risk of drug interactions and adverse effects.
*   **Functional Status:** Health in the elderly is best measured by **function** (Activities of Daily Living - ADL) rather than just pathology.
