# [[General Toxicology]] > Duties of Doctor in Poisoning Case

### **Duties of a Doctor in a Case of Poisoning**

In any case of suspected or confirmed [[poisoning]], the medical practitioner has a dual responsibility: **Medical** (saving life) and **Legal** (aiding the administration of justice). These duties must be performed simultaneously and systematically.

---

### **1. Medical Duties (Therapeutic Protocol)**
The primary duty of the doctor is to save the life of the patient. Treatment takes precedence over legal formalities.

1.  **Immediate Resuscitation (ABCD):**
    *   **Airway:** Maintain patency; remove secretions/vomit; intubation if necessary.
    *   **Breathing:** Artificial respiration or mechanical ventilation if respiratory failure occurs.
    *   **Circulation:** Treat [[shock]] with IV fluids/vasopressors; monitor cardiac status.
    *   **Depression of CNS:** Treat coma or convulsions.
2.  **Removal of Unabsorbed Poison:**
    *   Induction of emesis or [[gastric lavage]] (stomach wash).
    *   Gastric lavage is crucial but must be performed with specific precautions (e.g., airway protection in comatose patients).
3.  **Administration of Antidotes:**
    *   Use specific [[antidote]] if the poison is identified (e.g., Atropine for Organophosphates).
    *   Use **Universal Antidote** or [[Activated Charcoal]] if the poison is unknown.
4.  **Elimination of Absorbed Poison:**
    *   Techniques like forced diuresis, dialysis, or haemoperfusion may be required.

### **2. Medicolegal/Legal Duties**
While treating the patient, the doctor must ensure legal requirements are met to assist the investigation.

#### **A. Preliminary Particulars**
*   Record the name, age, sex, occupation, and address of the patient.
*   Note the date and time of arrival.
*   Record two **identification marks**.
*   Record the history regarding the nature of poison, quantity, and time of ingestion as narrated by the patient or attendants.

#### **B. Confirmation of Suspicion**
If the doctor suspects **homicidal poisoning** (foul play), they must verify it before expressing an opinion:
*   Collect vomit and urine for chemical analysis.
*   Observe symptoms in relation to food or drink taken.
*   Consult a senior practitioner in strict confidence.
*   Ideally, remove the patient to a hospital. If the patient refuses, appoint trustworthy nurses to administer food/medicine and prevent access by the suspected poisoner.

#### **C. Notification to Police (Reporting)**
The obligation to report depends on the nature of the case and the employment status of the doctor.

| Type of Case | Government Medical Officer | Private Practitioner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Accidental** | Must report to police. | Not strictly bound, but advisable. |
| **Suicidal** | Must report to police. | Not legally bound to report (Sec 309 IPC is not covered under Sec 39 CrPC). However, if the patient dies, police *must* be informed. |
| **Homicidal** | **Mandatory** to report. | **Mandatory** to report under **[[Section 39 CrPC]]**. |

*   **Failure to Report:** If a doctor intentionally omits to inform the police in homicidal cases, they are punishable under **[[Section 176 IPC]]**.

#### **D. Collection and Preservation of Evidence**
The doctor must collect and preserve any material that helps in the investigation. Failure to do so with the intention of screening the offender is punishable under **[[Section 201 IPC]]** (Causing disappearance of evidence).

*   **Samples to Collect:**
    1.  **Stomach Wash:** The *first* portion of the wash is most concentrated and important.
    2.  **Excreta:** Vomit, urine, and faeces.
    3.  **Blood:** 10 ml in specific preservatives (e.g., Sodium Fluoride for alcohol).
    4.  **Suspected Articles:** Food, drink, empty bottles, strips, vials, or glasses found near the patient.
*   **Procedure:** All samples must be sealed, labeled, and handed over to the police officer, obtaining a proper receipt.

#### **E. Dying Declaration**
If the patient's condition is serious and death is imminent:
*   The doctor should arrange for a **Magistrate** to record the [[Dying Declaration]].
*   If there is no time to call a Magistrate, the **doctor should record it** personally in the presence of two witnesses.
*   The doctor must certify that the patient is **conscious and mentally sound (Compos Mentis)** to give the statement.

#### **F. In Case of Death**
*   **Do not** issue a Medical Certificate of Cause of Death.
*   Inform the police immediately.
*   Send the body for a **Medicolegal Autopsy**.
*   Any opinion on the poison should be reserved until the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) report is received.

#### **G. Professional Secrecy in Court**
*   If summoned by the investigating officer or court (under **Section 175 CrPC**), the doctor **cannot** claim [[Professional Secrecy]].
*   They are bound to divulge all information regarding the patient.
*   **Concealing information:** Punishable under **Section 202 IPC**.
*   **Giving false information:** Punishable under **Section 193 IPC**.

#### **H. Public Health Duties**
*   In cases of food poisoning from a public eatery, the doctor must notify the **Public Health Authorities**.
