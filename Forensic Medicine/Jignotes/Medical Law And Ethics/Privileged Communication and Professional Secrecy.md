# [[Medical Law And Ethics]] > Privileged Communication and Professional Secrecy

### Professional Secrecy (Medical Confidentiality)

**Definition**
It is an implied term of contract between the doctor and the patient. The doctor is obliged to keep secret all information regarding the patient which he has learnt during the course of his professional relationship.

**Key Principles**
*   **Trust:** The relationship is based on trust, confidence, fidelity, and honesty.
*   **Duration:** The obligation to maintain secrecy persists even after the **death** of the patient.
*   **Consequence of Breach:** Voluntary disclosure resulting in harm to the patient (mental suffering, shame, or humiliation) without valid justification constitutes [[Professional Misconduct]] (Infamous Conduct).
*   **Liability:** The patient can sue the doctor for damages in a civil court for breach of contract/trust.

**Examples of Breach**
1.  Discussing a patient's illness with family/friends without consent (unless the patient is a minor or insane).
2.  Publishing photographs or case reports where the patient's identity is revealed without consent.
3.  Disclosing information to an employer without the employee's consent.

### Privileged Communication

**Definition**
It is a statement made **bonafide** (in good faith) upon any subject matter by a doctor to the concerned authority who has a corresponding legal, social, or moral interest/duty to protect.

**Concept**
It is the *exception* to the rule of Professional Secrecy. Here, the doctor discloses information *without* the patient's consent to protect a larger interest (Community/State).

**Conditions for Validity**
1.  **Bonafide Intent:** Must be made in good faith without malice.
2.  **Specific Authority:** Must be made *only* to the person who has the power or duty to act on it (e.g., Health Officer, Magistrate).
3.  **Community Interest:** The disclosure must serve the interest of the community or state, outweighing the individual patient's interest.

> **Note:** If the communication is made to the wrong person (e.g., the media or general public) or malicious intent is proved, the plea of privilege fails, and the doctor is liable for defamation.

### Exceptions to Professional Secrecy (Conditions for Disclosure)

A doctor can (or must) disclose confidential information under the following circumstances:

#### 1. Statutory Requirements (Compulsory by Law)
*   **Notifiable Diseases:** The doctor is bound to inform [[Public Health Authorities]] about cases of infectious diseases (e.g., Cholera, Plague, Smallpox, HIV, COVID-19) to prevent epidemics.
*   **Vital Statistics:** Notification of births and deaths (Registration of Births and Deaths Act).
*   **Suspected Crime:** Under **Section 39 CrPC**, a person (including a doctor) aware of specific serious crimes (e.g., murder, dacoity) is legally bound to inform the police/magistrate. Failure to do so is punishable under **Section 176 IPC**.
*   **Food Poisoning:** Must be reported to health authorities.

#### 2. Public Interest / Safety of Others
*   **Unfit Personnel:** If a person holding a job involving public safety (e.g., bus driver, pilot, train engine driver) suffers from a condition making them unfit (e.g., epilepsy, color blindness, severe hypertension, drug addiction), the doctor must inform the employer if the patient refuses to stop working.
*   **Venereal/Communicable Diseases:** If a patient with a sexually transmitted disease (e.g., Syphilis, [[HIV]]) intends to marry or infect an ignorant partner, the doctor may inform the partner/parents to prevent the spread of infection. (Supreme Court of India has ruled that "Right to Life" of the partner overrides "Right to Confidentiality" of the patient).

#### 3. Interest of the Patient
*   **Mentally Ill/Minors:** If a patient is a minor or suffering from insanity/suicidal tendencies, the doctor should inform parents/guardians to ensure proper care and prevent self-harm.

#### 4. Courts of Law
*   **No Absolute Privilege:** In India, doctors do not enjoy absolute privilege in the witness box (unlike lawyers under S. 126 IEA).
*   **Judicial Order:** If the presiding judge orders the disclosure of medical facts relevant to the case, the doctor **must** answer. Refusal constitutes **Contempt of Court**.
*   *Advice:* The doctor should initially protest based on medical ethics (secrecy). If the judge overrules, the doctor can request to write the answer to keep it off the public record, but must eventually comply.

#### 5. Self-Interest of the Doctor
*   **Negligence Suits:** If a patient sues a doctor for [[Medical Negligence]], the doctor is released from the bond of secrecy to the extent required to defend their professional competence in court.
*   **Fee Recovery:** To prove the services rendered when suing for unpaid fees.

#### 6. Consent
*   **Express Consent:** For insurance claims, employment medical check-ups, or medical reports requested by the patient.
*   **Implied Consent:** When a patient brings a relative into the consultation room.

### Medicolegal Aspects

1.  **Witness Immunity:** A doctor is immune from lawsuits for libel or slander (defamation) regarding statements made in the witness box in a court of law.
2.  **Section 202 IPC:** Intentional omission to give information of an offense by a person bound to inform is punishable (e.g., hiding a homicidal poisoning case).
3.  **HIV/AIDS:** The [[Medical Council of India]] and courts permit disclosure to the spouse/partner if there is a risk of infection, provided the patient has been counseled and refuses to inform the partner themselves.
4.  **Negligence:** Failure to warn a third party of a dangerous patient (e.g., psychiatric patient threatening violence) can lead to liability for negligence (Tarasoff Rule principles).
