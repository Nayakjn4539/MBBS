# [[Regional Conditions]] > Lumbar Canal Stenosis

### Definition
[[Lumbar Canal Stenosis]] is a clinical syndrome caused by the narrowing of the osteoligamentous vertebral canal and/or the intervertebral foramina, resulting in compression of the [[thecal sac]] and the [[cauda equina]] nerve roots. It is the most common reason for spinal surgery in patients over 65 years of age.

**Anatomical Criteria (Midsagittal AP diameter of the canal):**
*   **Normal:** > 12–13 mm
*   **Relative Stenosis:** 10–12 mm
*   **Absolute Stenosis:** < 10 mm

### Etiology and Classification
The condition is classified based on the underlying cause (Arnold’s Classification) or the anatomical location of the narrowing.

#### 1. Pathological Classification
*   **Congenital/Developmental:**
    *   Idiopathic (short pedicles).
    *   [[Achondroplasia]]: Premature fusion of neurocentral sutures results in short, thick pedicles and a narrowed canal.
*   **Acquired:**
    *   **Degenerative (Most Common):** Due to facet joint hypertrophy, thickening of the [[ligamentum flavum]], and osteophyte formation.
    *   **Spondylolisthetic:** Forward slip of one vertebra narrows the canal.
    *   **Iatrogenic:** Post-laminectomy (scarring or overgrowth).
    *   **Traumatic:** Late sequelae of vertebral fractures.
    *   **Metabolic:** [[Paget’s disease]] (enlargement of bone), [[Fluorosis]] (calcification of ligaments).

#### 2. Anatomical Classification
*   **Central Stenosis:** Narrowing of the main spinal canal affecting the cauda equina.
*   **Lateral Recess Stenosis:** Narrowing of the subarticular zone, compressing the traversing nerve root.
*   **Foraminal Stenosis:** Narrowing of the intervertebral foramen, compressing the exiting nerve root.

### Pathophysiology of Neurogenic Claudication
The hallmark symptom, [[Neurogenic Claudication]], occurs due to dynamic changes in the spinal canal dimensions during movement.

*   **Extension (Standing/Walking):** The [[ligamentum flavum]] bulges inward (buckles), and the neural foramen narrows. This increases epidural pressure, causing venous congestion and ischemia of the nerve roots.
*   **Flexion (Sitting/Bending forward):** The ligamentum flavum is stretched and thinned, and the canal diameter increases (by approx. 2.2 mm), relieving compression and restoring microcirculation to the nerves.

### Clinical Features
**Patient Profile:** Typically men over 50 years of age, often with a long history of intermittent low back pain.

#### Symptoms
1.  **Neurogenic Claudication:**
    *   Pain, numbness, tingling, or a sensation of "heaviness" or "water" in the buttocks, thighs, or calves.
    *   Precipitated by **walking** or **prolonged standing** (extension).
    *   Relieved by **sitting**, **squatting**, or **leaning forward** (flexion).
2.  **Back Pain:** Usually chronic low backache due to [[spondylosis]].
3.  **Simian Stance:** Patient walks with a stooped posture (hips and knees slightly flexed) to keep the spine flexed.
4.  **Sphincter Disturbance:** Rare, occurs in severe cauda equina compression.

#### Signs
*   **General:** Physical examination is often deceptively normal at rest.
*   **Spinal Movements:** Extension is often restricted and painful; flexion is usually normal and painless.
*   **Neurological Exam:**
    *   May show mild LMN signs (wasting, weakness) or absent ankle jerks.
    *   **Stress Test:** Neurological deficits (e.g., absent reflex) may only appear *after* the patient walks until symptoms occur.

### Clinical Tests
1.  **Stoop Test:** The patient walks briskly until pain appears. They are then asked to stoop/bend forward. If pain disappears while stooped and returns on standing upright, the test is positive for neurogenic claudication.
2.  **Bicycle Test of Van Gelderen:** The patient can pedal a stationary bicycle for a long distance without pain (because the spine is flexed) but cannot walk the same distance. This distinguishes neurogenic from vascular claudication.

### Differential Diagnosis: Neurogenic vs. Vascular Claudication
This is a crucial exam distinction.

| Feature | **Neurogenic Claudication** (Spinal Stenosis) | **Vascular Claudication** (Ischemia) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cause** | Nerve root ischemia/compression | Muscle ischemia (PVD) |
| **Aggravating Factor** | Walking, **Standing erect** | Walking (muscular effort) |
| **Relieving Factor** | **Sitting**, Bending forward (Flexion) | **Standing still** (Stopping movement) |
| **Time to Relief** | Slow (minutes) | Fast (seconds to minutes) |
| **Pain Location** | Proximal to distal (Buttock $\rightarrow$ Leg) | Distal to proximal (Calf $\rightarrow$ Thigh) |
| **Peripheral Pulses** | Usually Normal | Weak or Absent |
| **Bicycle Test** | Painless (can pedal) | Painful (cannot pedal) |
| **Walking Uphill** | Easier (spine flexed) | Painful (increased muscle demand) |
| **Trophic Changes** | Absent | Present (shiny skin, hair loss) |

### Investigations
1.  **Plain X-rays (Lumbosacral Spine):**
    *   Shows degenerative changes: Osteophytes, reduced disc height, facet hypertrophy.
    *   **Short pedicles** in congenital stenosis.
    *   [[Degenerative spondylolisthesis]] (usually L4-L5).
2.  **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):**
    *   **Investigation of Choice (Gold Standard).**
    *   Shows sagittal canal diameter and cross-sectional area.
    *   **Trefoil Canal:** The spinal canal may appear triangular (trefoil) due to facet joint hypertrophy.
    *   Loss of epidural fat and compression of the [[thecal sac]].
3.  **CT Scan:**
    *   Excellent for bony details (osteophytes, lateral recess stenosis).
    *   [[CT Myelography]] is useful if MRI is contraindicated.

### Treatment

#### Conservative Management
Most patients with mild to moderate symptoms are managed non-operatively.
1.  **Activity Modification:** Avoid hyperextension; use a cane or walker (to promote flexion).
2.  **Medications:** [[NSAIDs]] for pain, muscle relaxants, Gabapentin/Pregabalin for neuropathic pain.
3.  **Physical Therapy:**
    *   **Flexion Exercises:** To strengthen abdominals and reduce lumbar lordosis.
    *   **Williams' Flexion Exercises** are preferred over extension exercises.
4.  **Epidural Steroid Injections:** Can provide temporary relief for radicular symptoms.

#### Surgical Management
**Indications:**
*   Failed conservative treatment (pain affecting quality of life).
*   Progressive neurological deficit.
*   Cauda equina syndrome (absolute indication).

**Procedures:**
1.  **Decompressive Laminectomy:** The standard procedure. Removal of the spinous process, lamina, and thickened ligamentum flavum to decompress the dural sac.
2.  **Internal Decompression (Undercutting):** Selective removal of the hypertrophied portion of the facet joints and ligamentum flavum to preserve spinal stability.
3.  **Interspinous Spacers:** Devices placed between spinous processes to keep the spine in distraction/flexion (e.g., X-Stop).
4.  **Spinal Fusion:** Indicated if there is associated instability (e.g., [[spondylolisthesis]]) or if excessive bone removal during decompression renders the spine unstable.
