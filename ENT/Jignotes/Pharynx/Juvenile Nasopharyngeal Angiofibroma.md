# Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma (JNA)

### **Definition and Overview**
[[Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma]] (JNA) is a **benign**, non-encapsulated, but **locally aggressive** and destructive vascular tumor found almost exclusively in **adolescent males** (pubertal age group). It is the most common benign tumor of the [[nasopharynx]].

**Clinical Implication:** Although histologically benign, it behaves like a locally malignant tumor due to its potential to erode bone and spread intracranially.

---

### **Etiology and Pathogenesis**
*   **Hormonal Theory:** The tumor is considered **testosterone-dependent**. It is thought to arise from a hamartomatous nidus of vascular tissue in the nasopharynx that is activated by male sex hormones during puberty.
*   **Site of Origin:** The tumor arises from the **superior margin of the [[sphenopalatine foramen]]**.
*   **Pathology:**
    *   **Gross:** Lobulated, firm, sessile, or pedunculated mass. Pink/grey or purple-red in color.
    *   **Microscopy:** Composed of fibrous tissue stroma and blood vessels.
    *   **Key Pathological Feature:** The vascular spaces are lined by endothelium but **lack a muscular coat**. This prevents vasoconstriction, leading to profuse, torrential bleeding that is difficult to control.

---

### **Routes of Spread**
JNA spreads along the path of least resistance and through natural foramina.

| Direction | Structures Involved | Clinical Consequence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Medial** | Nasal cavity, Nasopharynx | [[Nasal obstruction]], [[Epistaxis]] |
| **Lateral** | [[Pterygopalatine fossa]] → [[Infratemporal fossa]] | Cheek swelling |
| **Anterior** | Posterior wall of [[Maxillary sinus]] | **Holman-Miller Sign** (Antral Sign) |
| **Superior** | [[Orbit]] (via inferior orbital fissure), Skull base | Proptosis, Diplopia, Intracranial extension |
| **Posterior** | Sphenoid sinus, Middle cranial fossa | Pituitary/Optic chiasma involvement |

### **Clinical Features**
*   **Age/Sex:** Almost exclusively in **males** aged 10–20 years (Average 14–18 years).
*   **Symptoms:**
    1.  **Epistaxis:** Profuse, recurrent, spontaneous, and painless. Often the presenting complaint.
    2.  **Nasal Obstruction:** Progressive and unilateral initially, becoming bilateral.
    3.  **Rhinolalia Clausa:** Hyponasal speech due to postnasal obstruction.
    4.  **Headache/Facial Pain:** Due to sinus obstruction or dural irritation.
    5.  **Conductive Hearing Loss:** Due to Eustachian tube obstruction leading to [[Serous Otitis Media]].

*   **Signs:**
    *   **Mass:** Reddish-purple, lobulated mass in the nasopharynx.
    *   **Frog Face Deformity:** In advanced cases, widening of the nasal bridge, proptosis, and cheek swelling give the patient a frog-like appearance.
    *   **Cranial Nerve Palsy:** Involvement of CN II, III, IV, V, and VI (Diplopia, visual deficits, facial numbness) indicates intracranial or orbital spread.

### **Diagnosis and Investigations**

#### **1. Clinical Examination**
*   Anterior Rhinoscopy and Diagnostic Nasal Endoscopy (DNE) reveal a vascular mass.
*   **Caution:** Digital palpation is contraindicated due to risk of bleeding.

#### **2. Biopsy**
*   **CONTRAINDICATED:** Due to the risk of fatal hemorrhage. Diagnosis is primarily clinical and radiological. Biopsy is only considered if the diagnosis is doubtful and must be done in the operating theater under general anesthesia.

#### **3. Imaging (Gold Standard)**
*   **Contrast-Enhanced CT (CECT):** The investigation of choice.
    *   **Holman-Miller Sign (Antral Sign):** Anterior bowing of the posterior wall of the [[maxillary sinus]]. This is pathognomonic for JNA.
    *   Shows bony destruction and widening of the sphenopalatine foramen.
*   **MRI:** Best for assessing soft tissue extension into the orbit, brain, and infratemporal fossa.

#### **4. Angiography**
*   **Diagnostic:** Identifies feeding vessels (mostly from the **[[Internal Maxillary Artery]]**, a branch of the External Carotid Artery).
*   **Therapeutic:** Allows for **Pre-operative Embolization** (24–48 hours before surgery) to reduce intraoperative bleeding.

### **Staging Systems**

#### **Radkowski Staging (Modified Sessions)**
Reflects the clinical behavior and is widely used.

| Stage | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **IA** | Limited to nose and nasopharyngeal vault. |
| **IB** | Extension into one or more paranasal sinuses. |
| **IIA** | Minimal extension into [[Pterygopalatine fossa]] (PPF). |
| **IIB** | Full occupation of PPF, extension into orbit. |
| **IIC** | Extension into infratemporal fossa or cheek. |
| **IIIA** | Erosion of skull base; minimal intracranial spread. |
| **IIIB** | Extensive intracranial spread. |

#### **Fisch Classification**
Based on tumor extension.
*   **Type I:** Tumor limited to nasopharynx/nasal cavity.
*   **Type II:** Invading pterygopalatine fossa, sinuses with bone destruction.
*   **Type III:** Invading infratemporal fossa, orbit, or parasellar region.
*   **Type IV:** Invading cavernous sinus, optic chiasma, or pituitary fossa.

---

### **Differential Diagnosis**
*   **[[Antrochoanal Polyp]]:**
    *   **Dodd’s Sign / Crescent Sign:** A crescent of air seen between the polyp and the posterior pharyngeal wall on lateral X-ray. (Present in polyp, absent in JNA).
    *   Polyp is avascular/pale, JNA is vascular/red.
*   **[[Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma]]:** Usually presents with cervical lymphadenopathy; JNA rarely involves lymph nodes.
*   **[[Encephalocele]]:** Pulsatile, reducible, cough impulse positive.

---

### **Management**

**Surgery** is the treatment of choice. Radiotherapy is reserved for specific cases.

#### **1. Pre-operative Measures**
*   **Embolization:** Of feeding vessels (Internal maxillary artery) 24–48 hours prior to surgery to minimize blood loss.
*   **Hormonal Therapy:** Flutamide (testosterone receptor blocker) has been used to reduce tumor size but results are variable.

#### **2. Surgical Approaches**
The approach depends on the stage and extent of the tumor.

| Approach | Indication |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Endoscopic Approach** | Current standard for tumors limited to nose, nasopharynx, and sphenoid sinus. Reduced morbidity. |
| **Transpalatal** | Tumors limited to the nasopharynx (Historic). |
| **Lateral Rhinotomy** | Provides excellent exposure for tumors extending into the maxillary sinus/pterygopalatine fossa. |
| **Midfacial Degloving** | Avoids facial scars; good for extensive lesions. |
| **Infratemporal Fossa Approach** | For extensive lateral extension. |
| **Le Fort I Osteotomy** | Access to nasopharynx and skull base. |

#### **3. Radiotherapy**
*   Indicated for **unresectable tumors**, extensive intracranial spread (Stage IIIB/IV), or recurrent residual disease.
*   Stereotactic radiotherapy (Gamma knife) may be used for intracranial remnants.
