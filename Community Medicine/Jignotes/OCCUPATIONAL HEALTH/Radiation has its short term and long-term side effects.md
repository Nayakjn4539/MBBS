# [[OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH]] > Radiation has its short term and long-term side effects

### Biological Effects of Radiation

The biological effects of [[radiation exposure]] in an occupational setting are broadly classified into two main categories: **Somatic** (affecting the individual exposed) and **Genetic** (affecting the germ cells and future generations).

> Flowchart classifying Biological Effects of Radiation into Somatic (Immediate & Delayed) and Genetic

#### 1. Somatic Effects
These effects are manifested within the life span of the irradiated individual. They are further subdivided based on the time of appearance:

**A. Short-term (Immediate/Acute) Effects**
These occur following exposure to high doses of radiation over a short period.
*   **Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS):** Symptoms appear immediately or within a few days.
    *   **Prodromal stage:** Loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting occurring within an hour or two.
    *   **Latent period:** Symptoms may subside for days to weeks.
    *   **Manifest illness:** Reappearance of symptoms including diarrhea, fever, bleeding from mucous membranes, and ulceration.
*   **Skin Effects:**
    *   **Dermatitis:** Inflammation of the skin.
    *   **Burns:** Severe thermal-like injuries.
    *   **Epilation:** Loss of hair.
*   **Blood Dyscrasias:**
    *   Marked decrease in blood cells, specifically [[lymphocytes]] and polymorphs (neutrophils).
    *   Increased capillary fragility.
    *   Aplastic anemia/pancytopenia.
*   **Death:** Massive doses can lead to death within days to weeks due to bone marrow depression.

**B. Long-term (Delayed/Chronic) Effects**
These appear months or years after exposure, often due to repeated low-dose exposure.
*   **Malignancy (Carcinogenesis):**
    *   **[[Leukemia]]:** This is the most frequent and significant result of repeated occupational exposure (e.g., in radiologists).
    *   **Solid Tumors:** Increased risk of [[Lung cancer]] (e.g., in uranium miners due to radioactive dust), skin cancer (squamous cell carcinoma), bone cancer, and thyroid cancer.
*   **Local Tissue Damage:**
    *   **[[Cataract]]:** Intense exposure to infrared rays or neutrons affects the lens.
    *   **Chronic Dermatitis:** Hyperkeratosis, atrophy of sweat glands, and brittle nails.
*   **Reproductive Effects:**
    *   **Sterility:** Temporary or permanent sterility (both male and female) depending on the dose received by the gonads.
    *   **Foetal Developmental Abnormalities:** Exposure during pregnancy can lead to microcephaly and growth retardation.
*   **Shortening of Life:** Statistically proven reduction in lifespan due to premature aging and increased disease susceptibility.

#### 2. Genetic Effects
These effects result from injury to the chromosomes in the germ cells and affect the *descendants* of the exposed worker.
*   **Mutations:** Radiation acts as a mutagen.
    *   **Chromosomal mutations:** Changes in chromosome structure/number, often associated with sterility.
    *   **Point mutations:** Changes in genes (DNA sequence).
*   **Inheritance:** Most radiation-induced mutations are **recessive**. Therefore, they may not manifest immediately in the next generation but accumulate in the gene pool, potentially causing hereditary defects in future generations.

### Comparison of Acute vs. Chronic Exposure

| Feature | Acute Exposure (Short-term) | Chronic Exposure (Long-term) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dose** | Large/Massive single dose | Small, repeated doses over time |
| **Onset** | Immediate (Hours to Weeks) | Delayed (Years to Decades) |
| **Key Manifestations** | Nausea, Vomiting, Burns, [[Acute Radiation Syndrome]] | [[Leukemia]], Solid cancers, Cataracts |
| **Outcome** | Recovery or Death (depending on dose) | Chronic disease, malignancy, genetic defects |

#### Clinical Relevance: Tissue Sensitivity
The extent of damage depends on the radiosensitivity of the tissue. Cells that divide rapidly are more sensitive.
*   **Highly Sensitive:** [[Lymphocytes]] (White blood cells), Bone marrow cells, Gonadal cells (Sperm/Ovum).
*   **Moderately Sensitive:** Skin, GI tract lining.
*   **Least Sensitive:** Nerve cells, Muscle cells.
