# [[Radiology In Ophthalmology]] > CT and MRI of Orbit

# Computed Tomography (CT) of the Orbit

[[Computed Tomography (CT)]] is frequently the first-line imaging modality for orbital diseases. It provides cross-sectional images with high sensitivity and specificity, superior to plain radiography for localizing lesions.

### Principle and Technique
*   **Mechanism:** Uses X-rays to create cross-sectional images.
*   **Views:**
    *   **Axial (CAT):** Cuts parallel to the optic nerve.
    *   **Coronal (CCT):** Cuts perpendicular to the optic nerve; excellent for visualizing extraocular muscles and the orbital floor.
    *   **3D Reconstruction:** Particularly useful in [[Trauma]] cases.
*   **Contrast:** Iodinated contrast agents may be used to enhance vascular lesions or inflammation.

### Indications and Clinical Findings

#### 1. Ocular Trauma and Foreign Bodies
*   **Fractures:** It is the best method for evaluating bony architecture.
    *   **[[Blow-out Fracture]]:** Coronal sections are particularly useful to evaluate the extent of fracture and herniation of contents into the maxillary antrum.
    *   **Teardrop Sign:** Herniation of orbital contents through the floor appears as a "hanging drop" or [[Tear drop sign]] opacity in the maxillary sinus,.
*   **[[Intraocular Foreign Body]] (IOFB):**
    *   CT is the best method for IOFB localization.
    *   It detects radiopaque foreign bodies (e.g., iron, steel).
    *   **Clinical Implication:** If a metallic foreign body is suspected, MRI is contraindicated; CT is the gold standard,.

#### 2. Intraocular Tumors
*   **[[Retinoblastoma]]:**
    *   CT helps detect **calcification**, which is present in 75% of cases,.
    *   It delineates the tumor and extraocular extension to the optic nerve or CNS.
    *   **Note:** CT should be used sparingly in children due to the risk of radiation-induced sarcomas.

#### 3. Orbital Tumors and Optic Nerve Lesions
*   **[[Optic Nerve Glioma]]:** CT shows fusiform enlargement of the optic nerve and enlargement of the [[Optic foramen]].
*   **[[Optic Nerve Sheath Meningioma]]:** CT shows tubular thickening of the nerve and "tram-track" sign (calcification).
*   **[[Rhabdomyosarcoma]]:** CT shows the orbital mass with adjacent bone destruction.

#### 4. Thyroid Eye Disease (TED)
*   CT scans show proptosis and **muscle thickening**.
*   **Key Feature:** Enlargement of the muscle belly with sparing of the tendons is the hallmark.
*   It may show anterior prolapse of the [[Orbital septum]] due to excessive fat.

#### 5. Orbital Infections
*   **[[Orbital Cellulitis]]:** CT helps differentiate preseptal from postseptal cellulitis and detects subperiosteal or orbital abscesses.
*   **[[Orbital Mucormycosis]]:** CT is essential to assess bone erosion and sinus involvement.

### Limitations of CT
*   **Radiation Exposure:** Significant concern, especially in pediatrics (e.g., retinoblastoma).
*   **Soft Tissue Contrast:** Less effective than MRI for distinguishing pathological soft tissue masses that are radiologically isodense.
*   **Contrast Reactions:** Risk of allergy to iodinated contrast media.

# Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Orbit

[[Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)]] provides tomographic images with excellent soft-tissue resolution without ionizing radiation.

### Principle and Technique
*   **Mechanism:** Relies on magnetic fields and radio waves; non-invasive.
*   **Sequences:**
    *   **T1-weighted:** Good for anatomy.
    *   **T2-weighted:** Good for pathology (edema/fluid).
    *   **Fat Suppression (STIR):** Essential for orbital MRI to allow delineation of soft tissue structures by suppressing the bright signal of orbital fat.
    *   **Gadolinium Contrast:** Used to assess vascularity and blood-brain barrier breakdown.

### Indications and Clinical Findings

#### 1. Optic Nerve and Neuro-ophthalmology
*   **[[Optic Neuritis]]:** MRI with gadolinium is recommended for the first episode or atypical cases.
    *   Shows optic nerve enhancement, increased signal, and swelling.
    *   **[[Multiple Sclerosis]]:** MRI of the brain is crucial to detect demyelinating plaques (periventricular white matter lesions) to predict the risk of MS.
*   **Tumors:** Excellent for differentiating [[Optic nerve glioma]] from [[Meningioma]] and assessing intracranial extension.

#### 2. Intraocular Tumors
*   **[[Choroidal Melanoma]]:**
    *   **T1-weighted:** Hyperintense (Bright).
    *   **T2-weighted:** Hypointense (Dark).
*   **Retinoblastoma:** Detects extraocular extension and pinealoblastoma (trilateral retinoblastoma) better than CT.

#### 3. Vascular Lesions
*   **[[Magnetic Resonance Angiography]] (MRA/MRV):** Useful for vascular lesions like [[Carotid-cavernous fistula]] or orbital varix without invasive catheterization,.
*   **[[Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis]]:** MR venography shows absence of flow void in thrombosed sinuses.

#### 4. Thyroid Eye Disease
*   **T2-weighted/STIR:** Identifies **active** disease (inflammation/edema) versus inactive fibrosis.

#### 5. Trauma (Non-metallic)
*   **Wooden Foreign Bodies:** MRI has a special role in localizing small plastic or wooden intraocular foreign bodies which may be missed on CT.

### Contraindications
*   **[[Magnetic Intraocular Foreign Body]]:** MRI is absolutely contraindicated if a metallic foreign body is suspected as the magnetic field can cause movement of the object, causing further damage,.
*   **Pacemakers/Cochlear Implants:** General MRI contraindications apply.
