# [[Neurotoxic Poisons (Deliriants)]] > Cannabis

### Cannabis (*Cannabis sativa*)

**Synonyms:** Indian Hemp, Marijuana, Pot, Grass, Weed, Hashish, Mary Jane.

#### **Source and Characteristics**
*   **Plant:** *Cannabis sativa* (or *Cannabis indica*). It is an annual herb, 5–15 feet tall.
*   **Leaves:** Palmate compound leaves with an odd number of leaflets (5–7), having serrated margins.
*   **Active Principle:**
    *   **[[Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC):** This is the main psychoactive component.
    *   It is **not** an alkaloid but a fat-soluble oleoresin (cannabinol).
    *   Concentration is highest in the resin/flowering tops, lesser in leaves, and negligible in seeds/stems.

#### **Forms/Preparations of Cannabis**

| Preparation | Source | Appearance | Potency (THC %) | Consumption |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bhang** (Siddhi/Patti) | Dried **leaves** and fruit shoots. | Dried green powder/paste. | Lowest (2–5%) | Oral (Beverage like Lassi/Thandai) or Majoon (sweets). |
| **Ganja** | Flowering tops of **female** plants. | Rusty green, characteristic odor. | Moderate (5–15%) | Smoked in pipes (Chillum) or cigarettes (**Reefer/Joint**). |
| **Charas** (Hashish) | Resinous exudate from leaves/stems. | Dark green or brown gummy mass. | Highest (25–40%) | Smoked. Known as "Dope" or "Shit". |
| **Hash Oil** | Concentrated resin. | Viscous liquid. | Very High (60–70%) | Smoked (drop on cigarette). |

#### **Mechanism of Action**
*   THC binds to cannabinoid receptors (**CB1** in the CNS and **CB2** in periphery).
*   It acts as a **CNS Stimulant** initially, followed by sedation and hallucinogenic effects (Deliriant).

#### **Clinical Features (Acute Poisoning)**
Symptoms appear within minutes if smoked, and 30 minutes to 1 hour if ingested.

**1. Stage of Excitement (Psychiatric Effects):**
*   **Euphoria:** A sense of well-being, elation, and relaxation ("High").
*   **Disinhibition:** Excessive talkativeness, uncontrollable laughter or giggling.
*   **Disorientation:**
    *   **Altered Time Perception:** Time seems to pass very slowly (minutes seem like hours).
    *   **Altered Space Perception:** Distances appear distorted.
*   **Hallucinations:** Vivid visual and auditory hallucinations.
*   **Depersonalization:** Feeling of detachment from reality ("Dreamy state").
*   **Synesthesia:** Confusion of senses (e.g., seeing sounds, hearing colors).

**2. Physical Symptoms:**
*   **[[Conjunctival Congestion]]:** **Bloodshot eyes** (Hallmark sign).
*   **Appetite:** Increased appetite (The "**Munchies**") and thirst.
*   **Mouth:** Dryness of mouth (**Xerostomia**) and throat.
*   **Cardiovascular:** Tachycardia and orthostatic hypotension.
*   **Odor:** Smell of **burnt rope** in breath (if smoked).

**3. Stage of Narcosis:**
*   Giddiness, ataxia, drowsiness, confusion.
*   Deep sleep usually follows; the person wakes up hungry but without a significant hangover.
*   Rarely: Respiratory depression or coma in massive overdoses.

> **Mnemonic for Acute Effects:** **MARD**
> *   **M** - Munchies (Increased appetite)
> *   **A** - Altered time/space perception
> *   **R** - Red eyes (Conjunctival congestion)
> *   **D** - Dry mouth

#### **Chronic Poisoning (Chronic Abuse)**
Long-term heavy use leads to distinct syndromes:

**1. [[Amotivational Syndrome]]:**
*   Apathy, lethargy, loss of interest in work/studies, social withdrawal, and neglect of personal hygiene.
*   The person becomes "lazy" and lacks ambition.

**2. Hashish Insanity / Cannabis Psychosis:**
*   Chronic use can precipitate schizophrenia-like psychosis, mania, or paranoia in susceptible individuals.

**3. Flashback Phenomenon:**
*   Spontaneous recurrence of hallucinogenic effects ("Trip") weeks or months after stopping the drug. This occurs because THC is stored in adipose tissue and released slowly.

**4. Run Amok (Homicidal Impulse):**
*   A specific psychiatric disturbance seen in chronic users.
*   **Sequence:** The person consumes a large dose $\rightarrow$ becomes paranoid/depressed $\rightarrow$ suddenly grabs a weapon (knife/stick) $\rightarrow$ runs into a public place killing anyone in their path indiscriminately $\rightarrow$ usually ends by committing suicide or surrendering.
*   *Medicolegal Note:* Under **Section 84 IPC** (McNaughten's Rule), the person *may* plead insanity defense if they can prove they were incapable of knowing the nature of the act due to unsoundness of mind (though voluntary intoxication is generally not a defense).

#### **Fatal Dose and Period**
*   **Fatal Dose:** Very high safety margin. Lethal dose is theoretical.
    *   Charas: ~2 g
    *   Ganja: ~8 g
    *   Bhang: ~10 g/kg
*   **Fatal Period:** Death solely due to cannabis is extremely rare. If it occurs, it may be due to secondary accidents or cardiac complications.

---

#### **Diagnosis**
1.  **Clinical:** Burnt rope smell, red eyes, dry mouth, increased appetite.
2.  **Chemical Tests:**
    *   **Duquenois-Levine Test:** Chemical screening test (Purple color indicates positive).
    *   **Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC).**
    *   **GC-MS** (Gold standard for confirmation).

---

#### **Treatment**
Treatment is essentially **symptomatic and supportive**:
1.  **Stomach Wash:** If ingested (within a few hours).
2.  **Sedation:** **[[Diazepam]]** (Benzodiazepines) for agitation, anxiety, or "bad trips".
3.  **Reassurance:** "Talk down" the patient (calm environment) for panic attacks.
4.  **Fluids:** For dehydration.

---

#### **Postmortem Findings**
*   **General:** Signs of asphyxia (if death due to respiratory failure).
*   **Specific:**
    *   Congestion of GIT mucosa.
    *   Presence of leaves/seeds in the stomach (greenish fragments).
    *   Respiratory tract may show soot/tar deposits in chronic smokers.

---

#### **Medicolegal Aspects**
1.  **Accidental Poisoning:** Overdose is common but rarely fatal. Can occur in children eating laced sweets.
2.  **Stupefying Agent:** Used to facilitate robbery or sexual assault (Date Rape Drug potential due to sedation/confusion).
3.  **[[NDPS Act]] (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985):**
    *   Cultivation, possession, sale, transport, and consumption are illegal in India.
    *   *Exception:* The Act technically prohibits the resin and flowering tops (Charas/Ganja) but leaves (Bhang) are regulated differently by states.
4.  **Traffic Accidents:** Impairs driving skills (time/distance distortion).
