# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > There has been a report of deaths owing to Dengue in your district Hospital. How will you manage the situation & take preventive measures to control the problem? How can dengue be diagnosed?

# Management of Dengue Outbreak and Diagnosis

### I. Situation Management (District Hospital Level)

As a District Health Officer/Medical Superintendent, the immediate goal is to reduce mortality and prevent further spread. The management strategy involves **Epidemiological Investigation** and **Clinical Management**.

**1. Investigation and Administrative Action**
*   **[[Verification of Diagnosis]]:** Confirm that the reported deaths and cases are indeed Dengue. Do not wait for laboratory results to start control measures; clinical and epidemiological evidence is sufficient to initiate action.
*   **[[Notification]]:** Report the outbreak immediately to higher health authorities (State/National level) and WHO (if required under International Health Regulations).
*   **[[Surveillance]]:**
    *   **Active Case Finding:** aggressive search for cases (mild, moderate, severe) in the community.
    *   **Entomological Survey:** Assess vector density using indices like [[House Index]], [[Breteau Index]], and [[Container Index]].
*   **Triage Area Setup:** Establish a specific triage area in the hospital to segregate patients based on severity (DF vs. DHF/DSS).

**2. Clinical Case Management**
*   **Grading Severity:** Classify patients into Dengue Fever (DF), Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) Grades I-IV.
*   **Fluid Management:**
    *   **Oral:** For stable patients (DF/DHF Grade I), encourage ORS, fruit juices, and fluids. **Avoid plain water** as it may cause electrolyte imbalance.
    *   **Intravenous:** For DHF Grade II/III/IV or persistent vomiting. Use **Crystalloids** (Ringer's Lactate/NS). If shock persists, switch to **Colloids** (Dextran 40).
    *   **Blood Transfusion:** Fresh whole blood (10 ml/kg) or platelets if severe bleeding occurs or platelet count drops significantly ($<10,000/mm^3$).
*   **Symptomatic Treatment:** Use **Paracetamol** for fever.
    *   *Warning:* **DO NOT** give Aspirin/NSAIDs as they aggravate bleeding and gastritis (Reye's syndrome risk).
*   **Monitoring:** Monitor [[Hematocrit]] (Hct) and Platelet count regularly. A rise in Hct indicates plasma leakage and need for fluids.

### II. Preventive Measures & Vector Control

Since there is no specific antiviral treatment, vector control is the primary intervention.

**1. Anti-Larval Measures**
*   **[[Source Reduction]] (Environmental Control):** The most important measure. Eliminate breeding places by filling, leveling, and drainage.
    *   Remove artificial collections of water (tins, bottles, coconut shells, tyres).
    *   Cover overhead tanks and cisterns tightly.
*   **Chemical Control:** Use **Temephos** (Abate) granules in potable water containers (1 ppm).
*   **Biological Control:** Introduce larvivorous fish like *Gambusia affinis* or *Poecilia reticulata* (Guppy) in ornamental tanks and fountains.

**2. Anti-Adult Measures**
*   **Space Sprays:** For immediate reduction of adult mosquito density during epidemics.
    *   **Fogging:** Thermal fogging or Ultra Low Volume (ULV) sprays using **Pyrethrum** or **Malathion**.
*   **Residual Sprays:** Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is generally *not* effective for *Aedes* as they rest on hanging objects/clothes rather than walls, but targeted spraying may be used.

**3. Personal Protection**
*   Use mosquito repellents (DEET, creams, coils).
*   Wear full-sleeve shirts and long pants.
*   Use insecticide-treated bed nets (ITBN/LLIN), especially for sleeping infants/children during the day.

**4. Social Mobilization**
*   **Dry Day:** Observe a weekly "Dry Day" where all water containers are emptied, scrubbed, and dried.
*   **Health Education:** Educate the community on "Do’s and Don’ts" regarding water storage and symptom recognition.

**Mnemonic for Control (4 S):**
*   **S**ource reduction (tipping over containers).
*   **S**prays (Space sprays/Fogging).
*   **S**afety (Personal protection/Nets).
*   **S**urveillance (Larval indices).

### III. Diagnosis of Dengue

Diagnosis involves clinical assessment supported by laboratory confirmation.

#### A. Clinical Diagnosis
*   **Dengue Fever (Probable):** Acute febrile illness with 2 or more of the following: Headache, Retro-orbital pain, Myalgia, Arthralgia ("Break-bone fever"), Rash, Hemorrhagic manifestations.
*   **Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF):** Fever + Hemorrhagic tendency + Thrombocytopenia ($<100,000/mm^3$) + Plasma Leakage (Rise in [[Hematocrit]] >20% above baseline or pleural effusion/ascites).
*   **[[Tourniquet Test]]:** Inflate BP cuff to mid-point between systolic and diastolic for 5 mins.
    *   **Positive:** $>20$ petechiae per square inch ($2.5 \times 2.5$ cm).

#### B. Laboratory Diagnosis
| Test Type | Marker Detected | Timeline (Days of Fever) | Utility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[NS1 Antigen]]** | Viral protein (Non-structural protein 1) | **Day 1 to 5** | Early diagnosis; highly specific. |
| **RT-PCR** | Viral Nucleic Acid (RNA) | **Day 1 to 5** | Confirmatory; detects serotype; rapid. |
| **[[IgM ELISA]]** | MAC-ELISA (IgM Antibody) | **After Day 5** | Indicates recent infection. |
| **IgG ELISA** | IgG Antibody | Late / Convalescence | 4-fold rise in paired sera indicates past/recent infection; High titers suggest secondary infection. |
| **Virus Isolation** | Live Virus | Day 1 to 5 | Gold standard but difficult; requires cell culture/mosquito inoculation. |

*   **Hematological Findings:**
    *   **Leukopenia:** WBC $<5000/mm^3$.
    *   **Thrombocytopenia:** Platelets $<100,000/mm^3$.
    *   **Hemoconcentration:** Rise in Hematocrit (Hct) $>20\%$ (Sign of plasma leakage).

**Clinical Relevance:**
The **Critical Phase** (plasma leakage) usually occurs around the time of defervescence (when fever drops, usually days 3–7). This is when shock (DSS) is most likely to occur. Hematocrit is the most sensitive indicator of plasma leakage, not just platelet count.
