# [[Larynx]] > Acute Epiglottitis

### Acute Epiglottitis (Supraglottitis)

**Acute Epiglottitis**, also known as **[[Supraglottitis]]**, is a life-threatening, rapidly progressive bacterial infection of the supraglottic structures (epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds, and arytenoids) leading to gross edema and potential upper airway obstruction.

---

### Etiology and Risk Factors

*   **Age:** Primarily affects young children (typically 2–7 years), but incidence in children has decreased due to vaccination. Now increasingly seen in adults.
*   **Causative Organisms:**
    *   **Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib):** Historically the classic cause; incidence dropped dramatically post-vaccination.
    *   **Group A Beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS):** Now a very common cause.
    *   **Other bacteria:** *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae*.
    *   **Immunocompromised patients:** Can be caused by *Candida*, Herpes simplex virus, or Varicella-zoster virus.

### Pathology

*   **Site:** Infection is localized to the **[[Supraglottis]]**. The loose areolar tissue allows for massive swelling.
*   **Glottis Sparing:** The vocal cords (glottis) and subglottis are usually **not** involved.
*   **Mechanism:** Inflammation causes the epiglottis to curl posteriorly and inferiorly (becoming "omega-shaped" or "horseshoe-shaped" in extreme edema, though distinct from the omega shape of laryngomalacia), mechanically obstructing the laryngeal inlet.

### Clinical Features

The onset is usually **abrupt** (within hours) and rapidly progressive.

#### Symptoms
*   **Sore Throat:** Severe and acute onset.
*   **Odynophagia:** Severe pain on swallowing is a hallmark.
*   **Dysphagia:** Difficulty swallowing due to pain and obstruction.
*   **Fever:** High-grade fever (>39°C or 102°F).
*   **Respiratory Distress:** Air hunger, restlessness.

#### Signs
*   **The 4 D's of Epiglottitis:**
    1.  **D**rooling of saliva (due to inability to swallow).
    2.  **D**ysphagia.
    3.  **D**yspnea.
    4.  **D**istress.
*   **Tripod Position:** The child sits up, leaning forward with neck extended and chin thrust out (sniffing position) to maintain the airway. They often refuse to lie down (supine position worsens obstruction).
*   **Voice:** Muffled or **"Hot Potato" voice**. The voice is usually *not* hoarse because the vocal cords are normal.
*   **Stridor:** Inspiratory stridor (late and ominous sign).
*   **Toxic Appearance:** The child looks septic, anxious, and lethargic.

> **Clinical Implication:** **DO NOT** use a tongue depressor or attempt to examine the throat of a child with suspected epiglottitis in the OPD. This can trigger a reflex **[[Laryngospasm]]** causing total airway obstruction and death.

### Investigations and Diagnosis

Diagnosis is primarily clinical. Investigations should not delay airway management.

1.  **Laryngoscopy (Definitive Diagnosis):**
    *   **Children:** Performed **only** in the Operating Theatre (OT) where intubation/tracheostomy facilities are ready.
    *   **Adults:** Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy can be done cautiously if the airway is stable.
    *   **Finding:** **[[Cherry Red Epiglottis]]** (swollen, fiery red epiglottis). Edema of aryepiglottic folds.

2.  **Radiology (X-ray Soft Tissue Neck - Lateral View):**
    *   **Thumb Sign:** The swollen epiglottis resembles a thumb (normally leaf-shaped).
    *   *Note:* Do not send an unstable child to the radiology suite; airway priority comes first.

3.  **Labs:**
    *   **Blood Culture:** Often positive for *H. influenzae*.
    *   **CBC:** Leukocytosis.

### Differential Diagnosis: Croup vs. Epiglottitis

| Feature | Acute Epiglottitis | Laryngotracheobronchitis (Croup) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pathogen** | Bacteria (*H. influenzae*, *Strep*) | Virus (Parainfluenza) |
| **Site** | Supraglottis | Subglottis |
| **Onset** | Sudden, Rapid (Hours) | Gradual (Days), Prodrome present |
| **Fever** | High Grade (>39°C), Toxic | Low Grade, Non-toxic |
| **Cough** | Absent | **Barking / Seal-like** |
| **Drooling** | **Present** (Dysphagia) | Absent |
| **Posture** | Sits up (Tripod) | Can lie down |
| **X-ray Sign** | **Thumb Sign** (Lateral view) | **Steeple Sign** (AP view) |
| **Treatment** | Intubation + IV Antibiotics | Humidification + Steroids + Nebulized Adrenaline |

### Management

**A. Airway Management (Priority #1)**
*   **Hospitalization:** Mandatory, preferably in ICU.
*   **Securing Airway:**
    *   **Intubation:** Orotracheal or Nasotracheal intubation is the treatment of choice. Tube size should be smaller than usual due to edema.
    *   **Tracheostomy:** Performed if intubation is difficult or impossible.
    *   **Protocol:** In children, keep the child calm. Do not separate from parents or agitate with invasive procedures (IV lines) until the airway is secured in the OT under anesthesia.

**B. Medical Treatment**
1.  **Antibiotics:** IV antibiotics effective against *H. influenzae* and *Streptococcus*.
    *   **Third-generation Cephalosporins:** Ceftriaxone or Cefotaxime (drugs of choice).
    *   Ampicillin-sulbactam.
2.  **Corticosteroids:** IV Hydrocortisone or Dexamethasone to reduce edema and prevent scarring.
3.  **Nebulization:** Adrenaline nebulization may provide temporary relief in severe obstruction.
4.  **Supportive:** IV fluids for hydration. Humidified oxygen.

**C. Extubation**
*   Usually safe after 48–72 hours when fever subsides and air leak around the tube is present (indicating reduced edema).

### Complications
*   **Death:** Due to asphyxia/airway obstruction.
*   **Epiglottic Abscess:** Pus formation on the epiglottis.
*   **Systemic Spread:** Meningitis, Pneumonia, Pericarditis, Septicemia.
*   **Pulmonary Edema:** Negative pressure pulmonary edema due to effort against obstruction.
