# [[NUTRITION AND HEALTH]] > Short term high dose Vit. A supplementation is useful for prevention of Xerophthalmia

### Short-term High Dose Vitamin A Supplementation

**Rationale**
The strategy of short-term high dose supplementation is based on the physiological principle that [[Vitamin A]] (Retinol) can be stored in the liver for prolonged periods.
*   A single massive dose provides sufficient reserves to meet a child's requirement for **6 to 9 months**.
*   This acts as a "chemical immunization" against [[Xerophthalmia]] (Dry Eye) and nutritional blindness.
*   It is considered the **Short-term Action** under the [[National Programme for Control of Blindness]], while food fortification is medium-term and dietary improvement is the long-term strategy.

### Prophylaxis Schedule (National Immunization Schedule)

Under the Universal Immunization Program and the [[RCH program]], a total of **9 doses** (Total 17 Lakh IU) are administered to children under 5 years of age.

| Dose Number | Age of Administration | Dose (International Units) | Volume (ml)* | Remarks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1st Dose** | At **9 months** completed | **1,00,000 IU** | **1 ml** | Given along with [[Measles-Rubella vaccine]] (1st dose) |
| **2nd Dose** | At **16–24 months** | **2,00,000 IU** | **2 ml** | Given along with [[DPT]]/[[OPV]] Booster |
| **3rd – 9th Dose** | Every **6 months** | **2,00,000 IU** | **2 ml** | Administered biannually until the child reaches **5 years** of age |

*   *Note: The standard dispenser spoon supplied with the bottle usually holds 2 ml (2 Lakh IU) when full and has a mark inside for 1 ml (1 Lakh IU).*

### Therapeutic Supplementation (Treatment)

For children diagnosed with active signs of [[Xerophthalmia]] (e.g., [[Bitot's spots]], Night blindness) or severe [[malnutrition]], immediate treatment is required to prevent irreversible blindness (Keratomalacia).

**Schedule:**
1.  **Day 0:** Immediately on diagnosis.
2.  **Day 1:** The very next day.
3.  **Day 14:** Two weeks later (or 4 weeks later in some guidelines) to boost liver stores.

**Dosage by Age/Weight:**

| Patient Category | Dose per administration |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Infants < 6 months** | 50,000 IU |
| **Infants 6 – 12 months** (or weight < 8 kg) | 1,00,000 IU |
| **Children > 12 months** (or weight > 8 kg) | 2,00,000 IU |

### Clinical Relevance

1.  **Morbidity Reduction:** Vitamin A supplementation reduces the severity and duration of illnesses like **diarrhea** and **measles**.
2.  **Measles Protocol:** All cases of severe measles should receive high-dose Vitamin A immediately, as measles depletes Vitamin A stores rapidly, precipitating corneal destruction.
3.  **Safety:** While generally safe, an overdose (Hypervitaminosis A) can cause transient side effects like nausea, vomiting, and bulging fontanelle (pseudotumor cerebri) in infants.

### Mnemonic
**"9 at 9, then Double Time"**
*   **1** Lakh IU at **9** months.
*   Then **Double** the dose (**2** Lakh IU) every **Time** (every 6 months) until 5 years.
