# Pilon Fracture (Distal Tibial Plafond Fracture)

### Definition and Introduction
A **Pilon fracture** (also known as a **Plafond fracture**) is a fracture of the distal part of the [[tibia]], involving its articular surface at the [[ankle joint]]. The term "Pilon" is derived from the French word for "pestle," describing the mechanism where the [[talus]] acts as a hammer driving into the distal tibia (the anvil).

These are complex injuries characterized by:
*   Intra-articular comminution.
*   Significant [[metaphyseal]] bone defects.
*   Severe associated [[soft tissue injury]].

---

### Mechanism of Injury
The primary force involved is **axial compression** (vertical loading) combined with rotational or shear forces.

*   **High-Energy Trauma:** (Most common) Falls from a significant height or motor vehicle accidents. The [[talus]] is driven vertically into the tibial plafond, causing the articular surface to explode.
*   **Low-Energy Trauma:** Rotational injuries (skiing) causing torsional fractures.
*   **Position of the Foot:**
    *   **Plantarflexion:** Fracture tends to be in the posterior part of the tibia.
    *   **Dorsiflexion:** Fracture tends to be in the anterior part of the tibia.
    *   **Neutral:** Fracture affects the central or whole plafond.

**Clinical Implication:** Because the mechanism involves high energy, always adhere to [[ATLS]] protocols to rule out associated injuries (e.g., [[lumbar spine fractures]], [[calcaneus fracture]]).

### Clinical Assessment

#### 1. Symptoms and Signs
*   **Pain:** Severe pain at the ankle, inability to bear weight.
*   **Swelling:** Rapid and massive edema is characteristic due to the subcutaneous nature of the distal tibia.
*   **Deformity:** The ankle may appear widened or angulated.
*   **Skin Condition:** Look for abrasions, contusions, and **fracture blisters** (serous or hemorrhagic). The condition of the soft tissue envelope dictates the timing of surgery.,

#### 2. Neurovascular Status
*   Assess dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.
*   Check for signs of [[compartment syndrome]] (pain on passive stretch, paresthesia), which is a surgical emergency.

### Diagnostic Imaging

#### X-Rays
Standard views are required:
*   **Anteroposterior (AP):** Shows articular involvement and varus/valgus deformity.
*   **Lateral:** Shows anterior/posterior comminution and subluxation.
*   **Mortise view:** Assesses the talar shift and syndesmosis.

#### CT Scan [[Computed Tomography]]
*   **Gold Standard:** Essential for preoperative planning.
*   **Utility:** Defines the number of articular fragments, the degree of depression, and the location of fracture lines (sagittal/coronal planes).,

### Classification
The most commonly used system is the **Ruedi and Allgower Classification**, which is based on the severity of articular comminution and displacement.,

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Type I** | Cleavage fracture of the distal tibia without significant displacement of the articular surface. |
| **Type II** | Significant displacement of the articular surface but minimal comminution. |
| **Type III** | Significant displacement with severe comminution of the articular surface and metaphyseal impaction. |

### Management principles
The management of Pilon fractures is challenging and relies heavily on the **"Span, Scan, and Plan"** protocol due to the vulnerable soft tissue envelope.

#### 1. Initial Management (Emergency Room)
*   **Reduction:** Gross deformities should be realigned to take pressure off the skin.
*   **Immobilization:** High above-knee backslab or immediate temporary external fixation.
*   **Elevation:** Strict limb elevation to reduce edema.

#### 2. The Staged Protocol (Standard of Care for High Energy Injuries)
Attempting immediate open reduction in a swollen limb leads to high rates of wound breakdown and infection.

*   **Stage 1 (Day 0):** Application of a spanning [[external fixator]] (delta frame) across the ankle joint to maintain length and alignment. Often, the [[fibula]] is fixed internally (ORIF) at this stage to restore limb length and lateral column stability.
*   **Wait Period (7–21 days):** Wait for soft tissues to settle.
    *   **Clinical Indicator:** The appearance of the **"Wrinkle Sign"** (skin wrinkles when pinched) indicates edema has subsided enough for definitive surgery.
*   **Stage 2 (Definitive Fixation):** [[Open Reduction and Internal Fixation]] (ORIF) of the tibia.

#### 3. Definitive Surgical Management
*   **Goal:** Anatomic reconstruction of the articular surface and stable fixation to allow early movement.
*   **Technique:**
    *   **ORIF:** Using anatomical locking plates (medial, anterolateral, or posterior plates) and screws.
    *   **MIPPO:** [[Minimally Invasive Percutaneous Plate Osteosynthesis]] to preserve blood supply.
    *   **Bone Grafting:** May be required to fill metaphyseal voids caused by impaction.,

#### 4. Conservative Management
*   **Indications:** Undisplaced fractures (Type I), severely debilitated patients, or those with vascular compromise where surgery poses a high amputation risk.
*   **Method:** Cast immobilization for 6–12 weeks (non-weight bearing).

### Complications

#### Early Complications
1.  **Skin Necrosis and Wound Dehiscence:** Due to thin soft tissue cover and postoperative swelling. This is the most feared early complication.
2.  **Infection:** Superficial or deep (osteomyelitis).
3.  **[[Compartment Syndrome]]:** Rare in pilon but possible; requires fasciotomy.

#### Late Complications
1.  **Post-Traumatic [[Osteoarthritis]]:** Very common due to cartilage damage at the time of impact. May require ankle [[arthrodesis]] (fusion) or [[arthroplasty]] later.
2.  **Malunion:** Varus or valgus deformity affecting gait.
3.  **Non-union:** Failure of the metaphyseal-diaphyseal junction to heal.
4.  **Stiffness:** Loss of ankle dorsiflexion/plantarflexion.

### Key Summary Table: Pilon vs. Ankle Fracture

| Feature | Pilon Fracture | Ankle (Malleolar) Fracture |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Location** | Distal Tibial Metaphysis + Articular surface | Malleoli (Medial/Lateral/Posterior) |
| **Mechanism** | Axial Compression (Vertical load) | Torsional / Rotational forces |
| **Energy** | Usually High Energy | Usually Low/Moderate Energy |
| **Weight Bearing** | Involves weight-bearing dome | Involves stabilizing pillars (malleoli) |
| **Prognosis** | Worse (High risk of arthritis) | Better |
