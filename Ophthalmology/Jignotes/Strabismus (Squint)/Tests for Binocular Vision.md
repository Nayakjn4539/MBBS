# Tests for Binocular Vision

In the evaluation of [[Strabismus]] (Squint), assessing the sensory status of the eyes is crucial. These tests determine the presence of [[Binocular Single Vision]] (BSV), the grade of binocularity, and the presence of sensory anomalies like [[Suppression]], [[Diplopia]], or [[Anomalous Retinal Correspondence]] (ARC).

## 1. Worth's Four-Dot Test (W4DT)

This is a **subjective test** used to assess the sensory status of the eyes, primarily to detect suppression and diplopia. It dissociates the eyes based on **color**.

### Principle
*   Dissociation of the two eyes using complementary color filters (Red and Green).
*   The test prevents fusion by presenting different colored targets to each eye.

### Apparatus
*   **The Box:** Contains four illuminated dots arranged in a diamond pattern:
    *   **1 Red** (Top)
    *   **2 Green** (Sides)
    *   **1 White** (Bottom)
*   **The Goggles:** The patient wears red-green goggles.
    *   **Red filter:** Usually placed in front of the **Right Eye (RE)**.
    *   **Green filter:** Usually placed in front of the **Left Eye (LE)**.

### Mechanism
*   **Right Eye (Red Filter):** Sees the **Red dot** and the **White dot** (which appears Red). It *cannot* see the green dots. Total = **2 Red dots**.
*   **Left Eye (Green Filter):** Sees the **2 Green dots** and the **White dot** (which appears Green). It *cannot* see the red dot. Total = **3 Green dots**.

### Interpretation
The patient is asked, "How many dots do you see?" and "What colors are they?"

| Observation | Diagnosis/Interpretation | Clinical Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **4 Dots** (1 Red, 2 Green, 1 mixed/changing) | **Normal [[Binocular Single Vision]] (BSV)** OR **Harmonious [[Anomalous Retinal Correspondence]] (ARC)** | Normal fusion or adaptation to squint. (In ARC, 4 dots are seen despite manifest squint). |
| **2 Dots** (Red) | **Left Eye [[Suppression]]** | The cortex is ignoring input from the left eye. |
| **3 Dots** (Green) | **Right Eye [[Suppression]]** | The cortex is ignoring input from the right eye. |
| **5 Dots** (2 Red, 3 Green) | **[[Diplopia]]** (Double Vision) | Indicates manifest squint without suppression. |
| **Alternating** 2 Red / 3 Green | **Alternating Suppression** | Seen in alternating strabismus. |

**Diplopia Analysis in W4DT (if 5 dots are seen):**
*   **Uncrossed Diplopia:** Red dots appear to the *right* of green dots (Right eye image is on the right) $\rightarrow$ Indicates **[[Esotropia]]**.
*   **Crossed Diplopia:** Red dots appear to the *left* of green dots (Right eye image is on the left) $\rightarrow$ Indicates **[[Exotropia]]**.

### Clinical Implications
*   Used to differentiate between **organic visual loss** and **functional visual loss** (malingering).
*   Determines if a patient with strabismus has suppression (better prognosis for surgery if suppression is treated) or diplopia risk.

## 2. Maddox Rod Test

This is a **subjective test** primarily used to detect the presence and amount of **[[Heterophoria]]** (latent squint) and **[[Heterotropia]]** (manifest squint). It is very effective for measuring the angle of deviation.

### Principle
*   Dissociation of the eyes by changing the **form** of the image presented to one eye.
*   The test converts a point source of light into a linear streak, preventing the brain from fusing the two dissimilar images (a point and a line).

### Apparatus
*   **[[Maddox Rod]]:** Consists of a series of red parallel plano-convex cylindrical lenses mounted in a disc.
*   **Light Source:** A small point light source at 6 meters (distance) or 33 cm (near).

### Mechanism
*   Optical property: A cylinder refracts light rays perpendicular to its axis.
*   If the glass rods are **Horizontal**, the patient sees a **Vertical** red line.
*   If the glass rods are **Vertical**, the patient sees a **Horizontal** red line.
*   **Convention:** The Maddox rod is usually placed in front of the **Right Eye**.

### Procedure and Interpretation

**A. Testing Horizontal Deviation (Rod Axis Horizontal $\rightarrow$ Vertical Streak)**

| Patient Perception | Relative Position | Diagnosis | Prism Correction Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Line passes through the light | Center | **[[Orthophoria]]** (Horizontal) | None |
| Line is on the **Same Side** as the rod (Right) | **Uncrossed Diplopia** | **[[Esophoria]]** / **[[Esotropia]]** | Base-Out (BO) Prism |
| Line is on the **Opposite Side** to the rod (Left) | **Crossed Diplopia** | **[[Exophoria]]** / **[[Exotropia]]** | Base-In (BI) Prism |

**B. Testing Vertical Deviation (Rod Axis Vertical $\rightarrow$ Horizontal Streak)**

| Patient Perception | Relative Position | Diagnosis | Prism Correction Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Line passes through the light | Center | **[[Orthophoria]]** (Vertical) | None |
| Line is **Below** the light | Upper Image belongs to LE (Light), Lower to RE (Line) | Right **[[Hypertropia]]** (RE deviated Up, Image Down) | Base-Down Prism |
| Line is **Above** the light | Lower Image belongs to LE, Upper to RE | Right **[[Hypotropia]]** (RE deviated Down, Image Up) | Base-Up Prism |

### Double Maddox Rod Test
*   Used to detect and measure **[[Cyclodeviation]]** (Torsion).
*   Two Maddox rods (one red, one white) are placed in a trial frame, one before each eye. The patient rotates them until the two lines appear parallel.

## 3. Other Sensory Tests (Brief Overview)

While Worth 4 Dot and Maddox Rod are primary, other tests include:

### Bagolini Striated Glasses
*   **Least dissociative test** (most physiological).
*   **Principle:** Glasses have fine striations that convert a point light into a line without obstructing the view of the surroundings.
*   **Result:** Patient sees a cross (X) if binocular vision is normal.
*   **Clinical Use:** Best for detecting **Microtropia** and Harmonious **[[Anomalous Retinal Correspondence]]** (ARC).

### Synoptophore (Major Amblyoscope)
*   **Instrument:** Two tubes with mirrors and slides.
*   **Uses:**
    *   Determines objective and subjective angle of squint.
    *   Grades of [[Binocular Vision]]:
        1.  **Simultaneous Perception (SMP):** Bird in a cage.
        2.  **Fusion:** Two incomplete rabbits forming one.
        3.  **[[Stereopsis]]:** Bucket slide (depth perception).

## Mnemonics for Exam Recall

*   **Worth 4 Dot Diplopia:**
    *   **UNCROSSED** Diplopia (Red dots on Right, Green on Left) = **ESO** (Think: "Crossed eyes give Uncrossed images").
    *   **CROSSED** Diplopia (Red dots on Left, Green on Right) = **EXO** (Think: "X" for Exo and Crossed).

*   **Maddox Rod:**
    *   **"Same Side is Simple"**: If the line is on the same side as the rod $\rightarrow$ Uncrossed $\rightarrow$ **Esophoria** (Simple/convergent).
    *   **"Opposite is Out"**: If the line is on the opposite side $\rightarrow$ Crossed $\rightarrow$ **Exophoria** (Outward deviation).
