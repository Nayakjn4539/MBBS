# Role of Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) in Polio Eradication

[[Inactivated Polio Vaccine]] (IPV), also known as the **Salk Vaccine**, plays a pivotal and strategic role in the final stages of the global polio eradication initiative. Unlike [[Oral Polio Vaccine]] (OPV), which is live-attenuated, IPV consists of killed polioviruses (Types 1, 2, and 3).

### 1. The "Polio Endgame" Strategy
The most critical role of IPV is facilitating the **Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan**.
*   **The "Switch":** The global eradication program switched from **trivalent OPV (tOPV)** to **bivalent OPV (bOPV)** in April 2016. This involved removing the Type 2 component from OPV because Wild Poliovirus Type 2 has been eradicated, and the Type 2 vaccine strain was the primary cause of [[Vaccine Derived Poliovirus]] (VDPV).
*   **Risk Mitigation:** IPV was introduced into routine immunization to maintain population immunity against **Type 2 poliovirus** after the withdrawal of tOPV. It acts as an insurance policy to protect the population in case of a Type 2 outbreak (e.g., from a laboratory leak or cVDPV).
*   **Priming:** A single dose of IPV "primes" the immune system. If a child previously vaccinated with IPV is later exposed to the virus (or monovalent OPV during an outbreak), they mount a rapid and massive immune response.

### 2. Prevention of VAPP and VDPV
*   **Zero Risk of Paralysis:** Being a killed vaccine, IPV carries **zero risk** of causing [[Vaccine Associated Paralytic Poliomyelitis]] (VAPP). In contrast, OPV causes VAPP in approximately 1 per 2.7 million doses.
*   **Halting VDPV:** The ultimate long-term goal of eradication is to stop all OPV use because the live virus in OPV can mutate and circulate (cVDPV). IPV allows for continued protection against paralysis without reintroducing live virus into the environment.

### 3. Mechanism of Immunity
*   **Humoral Immunity:** IPV is highly effective at stimulating the production of circulating antibodies (**IgG**, IgM, IgA) in the blood.
*   **Prevents Paralysis:** These antibodies neutralize the virus during the viremic stage, preventing it from invading the Central Nervous System (CNS). Thus, it protects the *individual* from paralysis.
*   **Limitation:** Unlike OPV, IPV induces very little localized intestinal (mucosal) immunity. Therefore, it does not prevent the multiplication of wild poliovirus in the gut. A vaccinated person can still get infected and excrete the virus (act as a carrier), potentially transmitting it to others.

### 4. Sequential Schedule
*   Some countries utilize a sequential schedule (IPV followed by OPV).
*   **Role:** This strategy reduces the risk of VAPP (caused by OPV) while maintaining the benefits of high intestinal immunity conferred by OPV.

### 5. Fractional IPV (fIPV) in India
To manage global vaccine shortages and cost, India introduced **Fractional IPV (fIPV)**.
*   **Dose:** 0.1 ml (1/5th of the standard IM dose).
*   **Route:** **Intradermal**.
*   **Schedule:** As of January 1, 2023, the schedule includes **three doses**:
    1.  **6 weeks** (with OPV-1 and Penta-1)
    2.  **14 weeks** (with OPV-3 and Penta-3)
    3.  **9 months** (with MR-1).
*   **Site:** Right Upper Arm (for the 6 and 14-week doses) and Left Upper Arm (for the 9-month dose).

### Comparison: IPV vs OPV

| Feature | Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) | Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type** | Killed (Formalin inactivated) | Live Attenuated |
| **Route** | Injection (IM or ID) | Oral (Drops) |
| **Immunity** | **Humoral** (Circulating antibodies) | **Humoral + Local** (Intestinal IgA) |
| **VAPP Risk** | **Zero** | Rare risk exists |
| **Transmission** | Does not stop gut reinfection/transmission | Prevents gut reinfection (breaks chain of transmission) |
| **Epidemics** | Not useful for controlling epidemics | **Very effective** in controlling epidemics |
| **Use in Immunocompromised** | **Safe** | Contraindicated |

### Mnemonic
**IPV** is **SAFE**:
*   **S** - **S**alk Strain (Killed)
*   **A** - **A**ntibodies in blood (Humoral Immunity)
*   **F** - **F**ractional dose (0.1 ml ID) used in India
*   **E** - **E**liminates risk of VAPP/VDPV (Safe for immunocompromised)

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Immunocompromised Patients:** IPV is the only safe option for children with known immunodeficiency (e.g., HIV, malignancy) or those on immunosuppressants, as live OPV can cause paralysis in these groups.
*   **Pregnancy:** IPV is safe to administer during pregnancy if protection is required.
