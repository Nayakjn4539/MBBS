# Bone Anatomy and Histology

### 1. Classification and Organization of Bones

The human skeleton is composed of **206 bones**, categorized based on location and shape.

**Organization of the Skeleton**
*   **[[Axial Skeleton]] (80 bones):** Skull (Cranium, Face), Vertebral column, Sternum, Ribs, Hyoid, Ear ossicles.
*   **[[Appendicular Skeleton]] (126 bones):** Pectoral girdle, Upper limbs, Pelvic girdle, Lower limbs.

**Classification by Shape**
| Type | Description | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Long Bones** | Length > Width; act as levers | [[Femur]], [[Humerus]], [[Tibia]] |
| **Short Bones** | Cube-shaped; provide stability | [[Carpal bones]], [[Tarsal bones]] |
| **Flat Bones** | Thin, curved; protect organs | [[Skull]], [[Scapula]], [[Ribs]] |
| **Irregular Bones** | Complex shapes | [[Vertebrae]], [[Pelvis]] |
| **[[Sesamoid Bone]]** | Develop within tendons; modify pressure | [[Patella]], [[Pisiform]] |

### 2. Macroscopic Anatomy (Parts of a Long Bone)

A typical long bone is divided into four distinct regions during development and growth.

#### A. Epiphysis
*   The end part of a long bone.
*   Arises from a **secondary center of ossification**.
*   Composed largely of [[Cancellous Bone]] covered by articular cartilage.
*   **Clinical Implication:** Involvement of the epiphysis in fractures may lead to secondary osteoarthritis or growth disturbances.

#### B. Physis ([[Growth Plate]])
*   The cartilaginous plate separating the epiphysis from the metaphysis.
*   Responsible for the longitudinal growth of the bone.
*   **Zones of the Physis:**
    1.  **Zone of Reserve Cells:** Resting cells.
    2.  **Zone of Proliferation:** Cells multiply; active growth.
    3.  **Zone of Hypertrophy:** Cells increase in size (weakest zone, common site of fractures).
    4.  **Zone of Calcification:** Matrix calcifies.
    5.  **Zone of Ossification/Vascular Invasion.**

#### C. Metaphysis
*   The flared portion where the diaphysis meets the physis.
*   **Vascularity:** It is the **most vascular** part of the bone.
*   **Hair-pin Loop Arrangement:** The blood vessels (end arteries) here form hair-pin loops, leading to **sluggish blood flow**.
*   **Clinical Implication:** The sluggish flow and relative lack of phagocytes (macrophages) make the metaphysis the most common site for [[Acute Hematogenous Osteomyelitis]] in children.

#### D. Diaphysis (Shaft)
*   The tubular shaft of the bone.
*   Arises from the **primary center of ossification**.
*   Composed of thick, strong [[Cortical Bone]] surrounding the [[Medullary Cavity]].
*   **Marrow:** Contains red marrow in children (hematopoietic) and yellow marrow (fatty) in adults.

#### E. Periosteum
*   A fibrous membrane covering the outer surface of the bone (except articular surfaces).
*   **Layers:**
    1.  **Outer Fibrous Layer:** Dense connective tissue.
    2.  **Inner Cambium Layer:** Contains osteoprogenitor cells (osteogenic potential).
*   **Clinical Implication:** In children, the periosteum is thick and loosely attached, allowing subperiosteal abscesses to form easily but containing the pus (preventing soft tissue spread initially).

### 3. Microscopic Anatomy (Histology)

Bone tissue is organized into two major structural types.

#### A. Cortical Bone (Compact Bone)
*   Found in the **diaphysis** (shaft) of long bones.
*   **Structure:** Dense and solid; provides strength in compression.
*   **[[Osteon]] (Haversian System):** The basic structural unit of cortical bone.
    *   **[[Haversian Canal]]:** Central canal containing blood vessels and nerves running longitudinally.
    *   **[[Lamellae]]:** Concentric rings of bone matrix surrounding the Haversian canal.
    *   **[[Volkmann's Canals]]:** Transverse canals connecting Haversian canals to each other and to the periosteum/endosteum.
    *   **[[Canaliculi]]:** Tiny channels connecting osteocytes for nutrient transport.

#### B. Cancellous Bone (Trabecular/Spongy Bone)
*   Found in the **epiphysis**, **metaphysis**, and vertebral bodies.
*   **Structure:** Honeycomb appearance; a meshwork of trabeculae.
*   **Organization:** Trabeculae are arranged along lines of stress (Wolff's Law).
*   **No Haversian Systems:** Nutrients diffuse from the surrounding marrow.
*   **Surface Area:** Provides a large surface area for metabolic activity (calcium exchange).

### 4. Bone Composition

Bone is a specialized connective tissue consisting of cells and extracellular matrix.

#### A. Bone Matrix
*   **Inorganic Component (65-70%):** Primarily **[[Calcium Hydroxyapatite]]** crystals. Provides hardness and rigidity.
*   **Organic Component (30-35%):**
    *   **Collagen:** Mainly **[[Type I Collagen]]** (90-95% of organic matrix). Provides tensile strength.
    *   **Non-collagenous Proteins:** [[Osteocalcin]], [[Osteonectin]], Proteoglycans.

#### B. Bone Cells
| Cell Type | Origin | Function | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Osteoblast]]** | Mesenchymal stem cells | **Bone Formation** (lays down osteoid) | Mononuclear; Rich in **[[Alkaline Phosphatase]]**; Has receptors for PTH. |
| **[[Osteocyte]]** | Mature Osteoblast | Maintenance | Entrapped in the bone matrix; most abundant cell type; longest lifespan. |
| **[[Osteoclast]]** | Hematopoietic (Monocyte lineage) | **Bone Resorption** | Multinucleated giant cells; Rich in **[[Acid Phosphatase]]** (TRAP); Reside in Howship's lacunae. |

**Mnemonic:**
*   **B**lasts **B**uild bone.
*   **C**lasts **C**onsume (crush) bone.

### 5. Bone Turnover Markers

These markers are measured in serum or urine to assess bone metabolic activity.

| **Bone Formation Markers** (Osteoblast Activity) | **Bone Resorption Markers** (Osteoclast Activity) |
| :--- | :--- |
| [[Serum Alkaline Phosphatase]] (Bone-specific) | [[Urinary Hydroxyproline]] |
| [[Osteocalcin]] | [[Urinary Hydroxylysine]] |
| [[Procollagen]] Type I N-Propeptide (PINP) | [[Tartrate Resistant Acid Phosphatase]] (TRAP) |
| [[Osteonectin]] | N-Telopeptide / C-Telopeptide |

### 6. Types of Bone Architecture

Bone tissue is classified based on the arrangement of collagen fibers.

| Feature | **[[Woven Bone]]** (Immature) | **[[Lamellar Bone]]** (Mature) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Collagen Arrangement** | Random, disorganized | Organized parallel sheets (Lamellae) |
| **Cellularity** | High cellularity | Lower cellularity |
| **Strength** | Weak | Strong |
| **Location/Occurrence** | Embryonic skeleton, **Fracture [[Callus]]**, Tumors, Infections | Normal adult cortical and cancellous bone |
| **Pathology** | Pathologic in adults (indicates rapid turnover) | Physiologic in adults |

### 7. Blood Supply of Long Bones

Bones are highly vascular structures.

1.  **[[Nutrient Artery]]:** Enters via the nutrient foramen in the diaphysis; supplies the inner 2/3 of the cortex and marrow.
    *   *Rule:* "To the elbow I go, from the knee I flee" (direction of the nutrient foramen is opposite to the growing end).
2.  **Metaphyseal Vessels:** Numerous; supply the metaphysis.
3.  **Epiphyseal Vessels:** Supply the epiphysis.
4.  **Periosteal Vessels:** Supply the outer 1/3 of the cortex.

**Clinical Implication:** In infants (<2 years), metaphyseal and epiphyseal vessels may communicate, allowing osteomyelitis to spread to the epiphysis and joint (Septic Arthritis). In older children, the growth plate acts as a barrier.

### 8. Principles of Bone Grafting

When bone is transplanted (grafted), it functions via three mechanisms:

1.  **[[Osteogenesis]]:** The graft itself contains viable cells (osteoblasts) that form new bone. (Best seen in fresh autografts).
2.  **[[Osteoconduction]]:** The graft acts as a scaffold/trellis for the host's new vessels and cells to grow into.
3.  **[[Osteoinduction]]:** The graft releases growth factors (e.g., [[Bone Morphogenetic Protein]] - BMP) that stimulate host mesenchymal cells to differentiate into osteoblasts.
