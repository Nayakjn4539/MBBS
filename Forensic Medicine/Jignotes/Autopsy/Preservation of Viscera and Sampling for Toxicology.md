# [[Autopsy]] > Preservation of Viscera and Sampling for Toxicology

### Preservation of Viscera and Sampling for Toxicology

In medico-legal practice, the collection and preservation of viscera and body fluids for chemical analysis is a critical step in establishing the cause of death, particularly in cases of poisoning.

### Indications for Preservation of Viscera
Viscera must be preserved in the following scenarios:
1.  **Suspected Poisoning:** History or clinical signs suggestive of [[poisoning]].
2.  **Intoxication:** Deceased was known to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
3.  **Obscure/Negative Autopsy:** Where the cause of death is not found after gross [[autopsy]].
4.  **Suspicious Circumstances:** Any death involving foul play or young women (e.g., [[Dowry death]]).
5.  **Advanced Decomposition:** Where anatomical findings are obscured.
6.  **Burning cases:** To rule out incapacitation by drugs or [[Carbon monoxide]] prior to fire.
7.  **Accidents:** Involving drivers or machine operators to rule out impairment.

### Routine Viscera to be Preserved
In all standard cases, the following set of organs/fluids must be collected.

| Specimen | Quantity Required | Purpose/Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stomach & Contents** | **Entire stomach** (opened) with full contents. | Unabsorbed poison is found here. Helps estimate total dose ingested. |
| **Small Intestine** | **Upper 30 cm** (proximal jejunum) with contents. | Site of absorption. |
| **Liver** | **500 gm** (or whole in infants) including [[gallbladder]]. | Major organ for metabolism/detoxification; concentrates poisons. Right lobe preferred (less PM diffusion). |
| **Kidney** | **Half of each kidney** (cut longitudinally). | Organ of excretion; concentrates poisons. |
| **Blood** | **10–30 ml** (minimum 10 ml). | Quantitative analysis; indicates circulating poison levels. |
| **Urine** | **30–100 ml** (as much as available). | Excretory product; useful for screening drugs/metabolites. |

### Special Specimens (Additional Viscera)
Certain poisons target specific organs or are stored in specific tissues. These are collected *in addition* to routine viscera based on the suspected agent.

1.  **Brain (One hemisphere/500g):** For lipophilic poisons, volatile anesthetics, [[Alcohol]], [[Barbiturates]], [[Strychnine]], and [[Organophosphorus compounds]].
2.  **Spinal Cord:** For spinal poisons like [[Strychnine]] and [[Gelsemium]].
3.  **Lung (One entire lung):** For gaseous/volatile poisons ([[Hydrocyanic acid]], alcohol, chloroform) and solvent abuse. **Must be packed in a nylon bag.**
4.  **Heart:** For cardiac poisons ([[Digitalis]], [[Aconite]], [[Oleander]], [[Nicotine]]).
5.  **Bone (Distal femur - 10-15 cm):** For chronic [[Arsenic]], [[Lead]], [[Antimony]] (heavy metals deposit in bone matrix).
6.  **Hair (Plucked with roots):** For chronic heavy metal poisoning (timeline of exposure).
7.  **Nails (Entire):** Chronic Arsenic poisoning.
8.  **Skin:** From injection sites (drug abuse, snake bite) + control sample from opposite side.
9.  **Vitreous Humour:** For [[Alcohol]] estimation (stable after death, resists putrefaction).
10. **Fat (Abdominal):** For pesticides ([[Organochlorines]]), lipophilic drugs.

### Collection Techniques

*   **Blood:** Must be collected from a **peripheral vein** (Femoral or Iliac vein). *Never* scoop blood from the body cavities (pleural/peritoneal) as it may be contaminated with stomach contents or fluids.
*   **Stomach:** Opened along the greater curvature. Examine mucosa for hyperemia, erosion, or smell. Keep contents and wall in the bottle.
*   **Intestines:** Double ligature at ends before cutting to prevent leakage.
*   **Solid Organs:** Cut into small pieces to allow the preservative to penetrate deep tissues.

### Preservatives
Choice of preservative depends on the suspected poison.

| Preservative | Indications | Contraindications/Drawbacks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Saturated Solution of Common Salt (NaCl)** | Routine cases (cheap, easily available). | **Corrosive Acids/Alkalis** (neutralizes/alters pH), **Aconite** (alkaloid destruction), **Solanine**. |
| **Rectified Spirit** (95% Ethanol) | Ideal for most organic poisons. | **Alcohol** (interferes with testing), **Phosphorus** (loss of luminosity), **Acetic acid**, **Phenol**, **Paraldehyde**. |
| **Sodium Fluoride** (10mg/ml) + **Potassium Oxalate** (3mg/ml) | Specifically for **Blood** samples. | Fluoride prevents glycolysis (maintains alcohol levels) and enzyme action (cocaine). |
| **No Preservative** | Bone, Hair, Nails. | N/A |
| **Liquid Paraffin** | Sometimes used for volatile poisons. | -- |

### Packing and Dispatch (Chain of Custody)

1.  **Containers:** Clean, wide-mouthed glass bottles (approx. 1-liter capacity) with glass stoppers. Do not use rubber liners if volatile poisons are suspected.
2.  **Filling:** Fill only **two-thirds** of the capacity. Leave space for gases of decomposition to prevent the bottle from bursting.
3.  **Grouping:**
    *   **Bottle 1:** Stomach + Intestine (GI tract).
    *   **Bottle 2:** Liver + Kidney (Solid viscera).
    *   **Bottle 3:** Blood.
    *   **Bottle 4:** Urine.
    *   **Bottle 5:** **Control Sample** of the preservative used (approx. 100ml) to rule out contamination.
4.  **Sealing:** Stoppers should be secured, covered with cloth, tied with tape/string, and sealed with the **official seal** (lacquer seal) of the doctor.
5.  **Labeling:** Labels must contain:
    *   Name of deceased, Age, Sex.
    *   Postmortem (PM) Number.
    *   Date and Place of autopsy.
    *   Police Station & Crime Number (Cr. No.).
    *   Signature of the Medical Officer.
6.  **Chain of Custody:** The sealed box, along with a copy of the PM report, inquest report, and a sample of the seal (in a separate envelope), is handed over to the police constable. A receipt must be obtained.

### Medicolegal Aspects and Autopsy Findings
*   **Authority:** Viscera are analyzed only upon written requisition from the Investigating Officer (Police) or Magistrate.
*   **Chain of Custody:** Any break in the chain (e.g., unsealed bottles, unauthorized handling) renders the evidence inadmissible in court.
*   **Negative Report:** A negative toxicology report does not always rule out poisoning (e.g., poison eliminated, decomposed, or not tested for).
*   **Smell:** Cranial cavity should be opened *first* in suspected poisoning to detect volatile odors (e.g., bitter almonds in [[Cyanide]]) before the strong smell of the GI tract masks them.
