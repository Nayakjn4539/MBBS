# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Domiciliary treatment of TB

### Domiciliary Treatment of Tuberculosis

**Definition**
[[Domiciliary treatment]] (or Ambulatory treatment) refers to the administration of anti-tuberculosis drugs to patients in their own homes (self-administration or supervised) without the need for admission to a hospital or sanatorium.

### **Historical Significance: The Chennai Study**
The shift from sanatorium-based care to domiciliary care is based on the classical controlled clinical trials conducted at the **Tuberculosis Chemotherapy Centre, Chennai** (now NIRT).
*   **Findings:** The study demonstrated that:
    1.  The clinical efficacy of treatment at home was **as effective** as treatment in a sanatorium/hospital.
    2.  The incidence of tuberculosis in close family contacts of patients treated at home was **no greater** than in contacts of patients treated in isolation in sanatoria.
    3.  Diet/Rest had little effect on the outcome compared to potent chemotherapy.

### **Advantages of Domiciliary Treatment**
1.  **Cost-Effectiveness:** It is significantly cheaper than hospital treatment.
2.  **Psychosocial:** The patient is not separated from the family and can continue to participate in the economic and social life of the community.
3.  **Feasibility:** It can be managed effectively by the [[Primary Health Care]] system and general health services.
4.  **Coverage:** Allows the health system to treat the entire pool of infectors rather than a select few who can afford/access hospitals.

### **Essential Components for Success**
For domiciliary treatment to be successful, the following must be ensured:
*   **Adequate Chemotherapy:** Free, uninterrupted supply of drugs (e.g., [[Rifampicin]], [[Isoniazid]]).
*   **Supervision:** To prevent default and drug resistance, treatment is supervised (concept of [[DOTS]]).
*   **Patient Compliance:** This is the *cornerstone* of successful therapy. Incomplete treatment leads to relapse and [[MDR-TB]].

### **Patient Instructions for Home Care**
Patients on domiciliary treatment must be educated on the following:
1.  **Drug Intake:** Collect drugs regularly and take them as prescribed.
2.  **Report Symptoms:** Immediately report to the [[PHC]] if new symptoms or side effects arise (e.g., jaundice, visual disturbances).
3.  **Safe Sputum Disposal:** Sputum is the main source of infection. It must be disposed of safely using one of the following methods:
    *   **Burning:** Receiving sputum in gauze/handkerchief and burning it.
    *   **Boiling:** Boiling water poured into the sputum cup kills bacilli in minutes.
    *   **Chemical Disinfection:** Sputum cup half-filled with **5% Cresol**; allow to stand for 1 hour before disposal.
    *   **Autoclaving:** 20 minutes at 20 lbs pressure (usually for hospital settings).

### **Indications for Hospitalization**
Despite the success of domiciliary care, hospitalization is still indicated in specific situations:
1.  **Emergencies:** Massive haemoptysis or spontaneous pneumothorax.
2.  **Surgical Intervention:** Patients requiring lung resection or other surgeries.
3.  **Serious Forms:** Severe complications like [[TB Meningitis]] or acute miliary TB.
4.  **Social Indications:** Patients who are destitute, have no home, or lack caregivers.
5.  **Complications:** Severe adverse drug reactions requiring monitoring.

### **Clinical Relevance: DOTS Strategy**
Modern domiciliary treatment is implemented through the **[[DOTS]]** strategy (Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course).
*   **Intensive Phase:** Health worker/provider watches the patient swallow the drug (Supervised).
*   **Continuation Phase:** Patient collects weekly blister packs; the first dose of the week is supervised.
This strategy ensures the advantages of domiciliary care while mitigating the risk of non-compliance.
