# [[Special Injuries]] > Blast Injuries

### Blast Injuries

**Blast injuries** result from the rapid chemical conversion of a solid or liquid explosive into hot gases, producing a high-pressure [[shock wave]] and a blast wind.

### Mechanism of Injury
An explosion generates a shock wave traveling at supersonic speed (approx. 1120 ft/sec).
1.  **Positive Pressure Phase:** A wave of very high pressure that compresses the surrounding air and objects.
2.  **Negative Pressure Phase:** A suction phase (vacuum) following the positive wave, lasting about five times as long.
3.  **Blast Wind:** Mass movement of air displacing objects and people.

### Classification of Blast Injuries
Injuries are classified based on the mechanism of trauma:

| Category | Mechanism | Injury Types |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary** | Direct effect of the [[blast wave]] (High pressure) on the body. Affects gas-containing organs. | • [[Blast lung]]<br>• Tympanic membrane rupture<br>• Intestinal perforation<br>• Air embolism |
| **Secondary** | Caused by **flying missiles** (shrapnel, debris) driven by the blast wind. | • Penetrating trauma<br>• Lacerations<br>• Abrasions<br>• Fractures |
| **Tertiary** | Victim is **thrown** by the blast wind against a solid object (ground, wall). | • Blunt force trauma<br>• Fractures<br>• Coup/Contrecoup brain injury |
| **Quaternary** | Miscellaneous effects not covered above. | • Flash burns<br>• Crush injuries (building collapse)<br>• Toxic gas inhalation (CO, Cyanide) |

### Specific Organ Injuries (Primary Blast)
Homogeneous tissues (muscle, liver) are relatively resistant to primary blast waves. Injury occurs chiefly at **air-tissue interfaces** due to spalling, implosion, and pressure differentials.

**1. Ear (Auditory System)**
*   Most common primary injury.
*   **Tympanic membrane rupture** with hemorrhage.
*   Disruption of ossicles and damage to the cochlea.

**2. Lungs ([[Blast lung]])**
*   This is the most fatal primary injury in survivors of the initial explosion.
*   **Pathology:** Alveolar rupture, thinning of alveolar septae, and intra-alveolar hemorrhage.
*   **Clinical:** Dyspnea, hemoptysis, cyanosis, and "blood-stained froth" in airways.
*   **Complication:** Systemic [[air embolism]] (air enters pulmonary veins $\rightarrow$ coronary/cerebral arteries $\rightarrow$ sudden death).

**3. Gastrointestinal Tract**
*   Subserosal hemorrhages and perforations.
*   The colon and cecum are most vulnerable (gas-filled loops).

### Types of Blast Environments

#### 1. Air Blast
*   Explosive force declines rapidly with distance (Inverse Square Law).
*   **Diagnostic Sign:** **Marshall's Triad** (seen in survivors near the epicenter or bodies).
    *   **Bruises**
    *   **Abrasions**
    *   **Puncture Lacerations**
    *   *Note:* These three are intimately mixed on the skin.

> **Mnemonic for Marshall's Triad: BAP**
> *   **B** - Bruises
> *   **A** - Abrasions
> *   **P** - Puncture Lacerations

#### 2. Immersion Blast (Underwater)
*   Water is incompressible; the shock wave travels faster and farther than in air.
*   The body has a similar density to water, so the wave passes through solid tissues but causes massive damage at air interfaces (lungs, gut).
*   **Key Difference:** **Intestinal damage** is more common and severe than lung damage compared to air blasts.
*   A swimmer floating on the surface may suffer less injury than one submerged vertically or swimming underwater.

#### 3. Solid Blast
*   Shock waves transmitted through solid structures (e.g., decks of ships, tanks).
*   Occurs when a person is standing/sitting on a rigid surface struck by a torpedo/mine.
*   **Injuries:** Primarily skeletal. Compound fractures of the lower limbs, pelvis, and vertebral column (calcaneal/talus fractures).

### Autopsy Findings

**External Findings:**
*   **Clothes:** May be blown off; shredded; traces of explosives (nitrates) may be present.
*   **Skin:**
    *   **Triad of injuries** (Marshall's Triad).
    *   **Tattooing:** Dust and dirt driven into the skin causing uniform darkening.
    *   **Burns:** Flash burns (singeing of hair, superficial burns).
    *   **Traumatic Amputations:** In close proximity to the bomb.

**Internal Findings:**
*   **Lungs:**
    *   Subpleural patchy hemorrhages (often in the line of ribs—"Rib Markings").
    *   Lung tissue may be hemorrhagic and consolidated (Liver-like consistency).
    *   Bullae on the surface (Emphysema).
*   **Heart:** Air embolism in coronary vessels; epicardial hemorrhages.
*   **Brain:** Cerebral air embolism; contusions.
*   **Abdomen:** Perforation of hollow viscera; mesenteric hemorrhage.

### Medicolegal Aspects

1.  **Reconstruction of Scene:**
    *   Pattern of injuries helps determine the victim's position relative to the explosion.
    *   Severe disruption/disintegration implies the victim was in contact with the bomb (e.g., carrying it or sitting on it).

2.  **Identification of the Dead:**
    *   In mass disasters, bodies may be fragmented.
    *   Methods: DNA profiling (muscle/bone marrow), dental records, fingerprints,.
    *   Fragments must be X-rayed to find specific metallic debris for identification or evidence,.

3.  **Suicide Bomber Identification:**
    *   Usually the most severely mutilated body (torso disruption).
    *   Hands/arms may be blown off or show specific injury patterns from holding the device.
    *   Foreign bodies (wires, switches) may be embedded in the remains.

4.  **Cause of Death:**
    *   Direct blast injury (Lung injury, Air embolism).
    *   Impact by flying missiles.
    *   Structural collapse/crush asphyxia.
    *   Burns/Inhalation of toxic gases (CO, Cyanide).

5.  **Collection of Evidence:**
    *   **X-ray the body:** Mandatory before autopsy to locate bomb components (detonator parts, wires, batteries) embedded in tissues.
    *   **Clothing:** Preserve for chemical analysis of explosive residues.
