# [[HEALTH PLANNING & MANAGEMENT]] > Proportion of institutional delivery is very low in your district. There is also poor arrangement of JSY referral transport & Ayushmati scheme. What steps you would take as a CMOH to improve the situation?

As the **Chief Medical Officer of Health (CMOH)**, the primary responsibility is to identify the bottlenecks in service delivery and implement a corrective action plan using the **District Health Action Plan** framework. The goal is to reduce Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) and Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) by boosting institutional deliveries.

Here is the step-by-step administrative and technical approach to improve the situation:

### 1. Situation Analysis (Diagnosis of the Problem)
Before acting, the exact causes for low performance must be identified through **Community Diagnosis**.
*   **Data Review:** Analyze [[HMIS]] (Health Management Information System) data to identify specific blocks/villages with the lowest institutional deliveries.
*   **Gap Analysis:** Assess whether the problem is **Availability** (lack of 24x7 centers), **Accessibility** (transport failure), or **Awareness** (cultural barriers).
*   **Feedback:** Conduct meetings with Block Medical Officers (BMOs), [[ASHA]] workers, and ANMs to understand field-level practical difficulties regarding transport and fund disbursement.

### 2. Strengthening Referral Transport (The Logistics)
Since poor transport is a specific complaint, immediate logistics management is required.
*   **Operationalize 102/108 Services:** Ensure the National Ambulance Service (Dial 102/108) is fully functional and responsive. Create a centralized call center at the district level for monitoring response time.
*   **Public-Private Partnership (PPP):** If government ambulances are insufficient, contract local private vehicle owners (jeeps/taxis) at pre-fixed rates to transport pregnant women. This is a crucial component of referral transport strategies in remote areas.
*   **Panchayat Involvement:** Utilize untied funds or specific referral transport funds available to Gram Panchayats to reimburse immediate transport costs for indigent families.

### 3. Improving JSY & Ayushmati Scheme Implementation
To restore community trust, financial incentives must be transparent and timely.
*   **Streamline Payments:** Implement/Strengthen **Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)** to ensure JSY cash assistance reaches the beneficiary's bank account immediately after delivery to prevent delays and corruption.
*   **Clear Backlogs:** Organize special camps to clear all pending dues of JSY beneficiaries and ASHA incentives. If ASHAs are not paid, they will not motivate mothers.
*   **Ayushmati Scheme (Waiting Huts/Private Partnership):**
    *   If the Ayushmati scheme refers to **Maternity Waiting Huts**, ensure they are functional with food and water so women from remote areas can come days before the expected delivery date.
    *   If it refers to **Private Sector Partnership** (like Vandemataram scheme), map and accredit private nursing homes to provide free/subsidized delivery services where government infrastructure is weak.

### 4. Infrastructure Upgradation (Supply Side)
*   **24x7 PHCs:** Ensure that all Primary Health Centres ([[PHC]]) are functioning 24x7. Post at least 3 Staff Nurses/ANMs on a rotation basis to ensure round-the-clock labor room coverage.
*   **Functional Labour Rooms:** Implement **LaQshya** guidelines to ensure labor rooms are clean, well-equipped, and respectful maternity care is provided. A clean and respectful environment encourages women to choose hospitals over home births.
*   **First Referral Units (FRUs):** Operationalize CHCs as FRUs with functional Operation Theatres and Blood Storage Units to handle C-sections and complications.

### 5. Manpower Management & Motivation
*   **ASHA Training:** Re-orient ASHAs on the importance of "Escort Services." They must accompany the pregnant woman to the hospital. ASHA payments should be linked to the safe delivery of the mother.
*   **Skilled Birth Attendants (SBA):** Ensure ANMs and Staff Nurses are trained as SBAs to handle normal deliveries confidently.

### 6. Information, Education, and Communication (IEC)
*   **Community Mobilization:** Utilize **Village Health and Nutrition Days ([[VHND]])** to counsel pregnant women and mothers-in-law about the risks of home delivery and the benefits of JSY/JSSK (free diet, drugs, and transport).
*   **Focus on 'Free':** Aggressively advertise the **Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram ([[JSSK]])** entitlements—emphasizing that transport, food, and medicines are completely *free* (Zero Expense Delivery).

### 7. Monitoring and Supervision
*   **Mother and Child Tracking System ([[MCTS]]):** Ensure every pregnant woman is registered and tracked for ANC and institutional delivery.
*   **Maternal Death Review (MDR):** Conduct strict social and facility-based audits of every maternal death to pinpoint lapses (e.g., did she die because the ambulance didn't arrive?).

### Mnemonic for CMOH Action Plan: **"TRAIN"**
*   **T** - **T**ransport (Fix ambulances/102/108)
*   **R** - **R**eferral Units (Make FRUs functional)
*   **A** - **A**wareness (IEC about JSY/JSSK benefits)
*   **I** - **I**ncentives (Timely payment to ASHA/Mother)
*   **N** - **N**ursing Staff (24x7 availability at PHC)

### Clinical Relevance
Increasing institutional delivery is the single most important intervention to reduce **Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)** and **Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR)** by preventing sepsis, managing PPH (Postpartum Hemorrhage), and providing neonatal resuscitation.
