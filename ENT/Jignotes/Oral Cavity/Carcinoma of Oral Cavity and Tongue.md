# Carcinoma of the Oral Cavity and Tongue

## Introduction and Anatomy
The [[Oral Cavity]] extends from the skin-vermilion junction of the lips to the junction of the hard and soft palate above, and the line of circumvallate papillae below.

### Anatomical Subsites
The oral cavity is divided into the following subsites:
1.  **Lips** (Upper and Lower)
2.  **Buccal Mucosa** (Cheek lining, including upper and lower gingivobuccal sulci)
3.  **Upper and Lower Alveolus** (Gingiva)
4.  **Retromolar Trigone** (Behind the last molar)
5.  **Hard Palate**
6.  **Floor of Mouth**
7.  **Anterior 2/3 of Tongue** (Oral Tongue)

**Clinical Note:** The **Posterior 1/3 of the tongue** (Base of Tongue) is part of the **Oropharynx**, not the oral cavity. Its lymphatic drainage and management differ significantly.

## Epidemiology and Etiology
*   **Most Common Type:** [[Squamous Cell Carcinoma]] (SCC) (>90%).
*   **Incidence:** High in South East Asia (India) due to tobacco habits. In India, it is the most common cancer in males.
*   **Site:**
    *   **Worldwide:** Lateral border of the Tongue is the most common site.
    *   **India:** Gingivo-buccal complex (due to quid chewing).

### Risk Factors (The 6 S's)
1.  **S**moking (Tobacco)
2.  **S**pirits (Alcohol) - Synergistic effect with tobacco.
3.  **S**pices
4.  **S**epsis (Dental sepsis, poor hygiene)
5.  **S**harp tooth (Chronic irritation)
6.  **S**yphilis (Syphilitic glossitis)

**Additional Factors:**
*   **Betel Nut/Quid:** Contains Arecoline (Group 1 carcinogen).
*   **Reverse Smoking:** Burning end inside the mouth (Chutta); associated with [[Carcinoma Hard Palate]].
*   **HPV:** Human Papillomavirus (16 and 18) implicated in a subset of tumors.
*   **Plummer-Vinson Syndrome:** Iron deficiency anemia, esophageal webs; associated with post-cricoid and oral carcinoma.

### Premalignant Conditions
*   [[Leukoplakia]] (White patch, diagnosis of exclusion)
*   [[Erythroplakia]] (Red patch, higher malignant potential)
*   [[Oral Submucous Fibrosis]] (Trismus, blanching, fibrous bands)
*   [[Lichen Planus]] (Erosive type)

## Pathology
### Gross Appearance
*   **Ulcerative:** Most common; rolled everted edges, indurated base.
*   **Exophytic (Proliferative):** Cauliflower-like mass.
*   **Infiltrative:** Deep invasion with minimal surface changes.
*   **Verrucous:** Warty, rugose appearance.

### Microscopy
*   **Squamous Cell Carcinoma:** Characterized by epithelial pearls and keratinization.
*   **Grading:** Well, Moderately, or Poorly differentiated based on keratinization and cellular atypia.

## Clinical Features (Site Specific)

### 1. Carcinoma of the Tongue (Oral Tongue)
*   **Common Site:** Lateral border of the anterior 2/3rd.
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Painless or painful ulcer/mass.
    *   **Ankyloglossia:** Fixation of the tongue due to infiltration of intrinsic muscles.
    *   **Referred Otalgia:** Pain referred to the ear via the **Auriculotemporal nerve** (CN V3) or Glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX).
    *    Dysphagia and slurred speech.
*   **Lymphatics:** Very rich. High incidence of occult metastasis.
    *   Tip $\rightarrow$ Submental (Level I) $\rightarrow$ Jugulo-omohyoid (Level III).
    *   Lateral Border $\rightarrow$ Submandibular (Level IB) and Upper Deep Cervical (Level II).
    *   **"Tip of Tongue lesions often drain bilaterally."**

### 2. Carcinoma of Buccal Mucosa
*   **Common in India** (Tobacco chewers).
*   **Site:** Gingivobuccal sulcus.
*   **Features:**
    *   Leukoplakia/Erythroplakia often coexist.
    *   **Trismus:** Indicates involvement of **Buccinator**, **Masseter**, or **Pterygoid muscles**.
    *   Skin tethering/fungation through the cheek.

### 3. Carcinoma of Retromolar Trigone (RMT)
*   **Definition:** Triangular area behind the last mandibular molar.
*   **Significance:** Early bone invasion (mandible) and early spread to muscles of mastication (Trismus).
*   Tumors here spread to the tonsil, soft palate, and floor of mouth.

### 4. Carcinoma of Lip
*   **Lower Lip:** More common (98%), often due to sun exposure. Better prognosis.
*   **Lymphatics:** Submental and Submandibular nodes.

### 5. Carcinoma of Hard Palate
*   Rare, except in reverse smokers.
*   **Note:** Glandular tumors (from Minor Salivary Glands) are common here.

## TNM Staging (AJCC 8th Edition Updates)
**Important Update:** The staging now incorporates **Depth of Invasion (DOI)** for T staging.

### T - Primary Tumor
| Stage | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tx** | Cannot be assessed |
| **Tis** | [[Carcinoma in situ]] |
| **T1** | Tumor $\le$ 2 cm, DOI $\le$ 5 mm |
| **T2** | Tumor $\le$ 2 cm, DOI > 5 mm **OR** Tumor > 2 cm but $\le$ 4 cm, DOI $\le$ 10 mm |
| **T3** | Tumor > 4 cm **OR** any tumor with DOI > 10 mm |
| **T4a** | **(Moderately Advanced)** Invades cortical bone of mandible/maxilla, deep extrinsic muscles of tongue, maxillary sinus, skin of face |
| **T4b** | **(Very Advanced)** Invades masticator space, pterygoid plates, skull base, or encases internal carotid artery |

### N - Regional Lymph Nodes (Clinical)
*   **N0:** No regional lymph node metastasis.
*   **N1:** Single ipsilateral node, $\le$ 3 cm.
*   **N2a:** Single ipsilateral node, > 3 cm but $\le$ 6 cm.
*   **N2b:** Multiple ipsilateral nodes, none > 6 cm.
*   **N2c:** Bilateral or contralateral nodes, none > 6 cm.
*   **N3a:** Node > 6 cm.
*   **N3b:** Any node with **Extra-Nodal Extension (ENE+)**.

### M - Distant Metastasis
*   **M0:** No distant metastasis.
*   **M1:** Distant metastasis (Lung, Liver, Bone).

## Investigations
1.  **Biopsy:** **Gold standard**. Edge of the lesion (normal and abnormal tissue) should be included. Incisional biopsy is preferred over excision for diagnostic purposes.
2.  **Imaging:**
    *   **CT Scan:** To assess cortical bone erosion (mandible) and lymph node status.
    *   **MRI:** Best for soft tissue extent (tongue muscle infiltration, marrow involvement).
    *   **OPG (Orthopantomogram):** Initial screen for mandibular erosion.
3.  **FNAC:** For palpable neck nodes.
4.  **Chest X-ray/CT Thorax:** To rule out pulmonary metastasis/second primary.

## Management

### General Principles
*   **Early Stage (I & II):** Single Modality - **Surgery** (Preferred) or Radiotherapy.
*   **Advanced Stage (III & IV):** Combined Modality - **Surgery + Post-op Radiotherapy/Chemotherapy**.

### Management of Primary Tumor
1.  **Surgery:**
    *   **Wide Local Excision:** With 1-1.5 cm safe margin.
    *   **Glossectomy:** Partial or Hemiglossectomy for tongue cancer.
    *   **Mandibulectomy:**
        *   *Marginal Mandibulectomy:* If periosteum is involved but no gross bone invasion.
        *   *Segmental Mandibulectomy:* If gross bone invasion is present.
    *   **Maxillectomy:** For hard palate/upper alveolus tumors.

2.  **Reconstruction:**
    *   **Pectoralis Major Myocutaneous Flap (PMMC):** Workhorse for head and neck reconstruction.
    *   **Free Flaps:** Radial Forearm Free Flap (soft tissue), Free Fibula Flap (for mandible reconstruction).

3.  **Radiotherapy:**
    *   Used as primary for T1/T2 (if surgery is contraindicated or for organ preservation) or Adjuvant post-surgery.
    *   **Brachytherapy:** Interstitial implants (Iridium-192) for tongue cancers.

### Management of the Neck
Since occult metastasis is high (especially in tongue >20% even in N0 neck):
*   **N0 Neck:** Prophylactic/Elective Neck Dissection (Supraomohyoid Neck Dissection - Levels I, II, III).
*   **N+ Neck:** Therapeutic Neck Dissection (Modified Radical Neck Dissection - MRND or Radical Neck Dissection).

---

## Specific Entity: Verrucous Carcinoma
*   Also known as **Ackerman’s Tumor**.
*   **Site:** Buccal mucosa (most common), gingiva.
*   **Features:** Slow-growing, exophytic, warty, "cauliflower-like".
*   **Histology:** "Pushing margins" rather than infiltrating. **Good Prognosis**.
*   **Treatment:** Wide surgical excision. **Radiotherapy is controversial** (fear of anaplastic transformation).
