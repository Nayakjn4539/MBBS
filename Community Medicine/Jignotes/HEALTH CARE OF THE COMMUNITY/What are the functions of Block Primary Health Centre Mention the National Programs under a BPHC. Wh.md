# [[HEALTH CARE OF THE COMMUNITY]] > What are the functions of Block Primary Health Centre? Mention the National Programs under a BPHC. What is "Record Linkage" and what is Tracking of Beneficiaries under Maternal Child Health Care?

### 1. Functions of Block Primary Health Centre (BPHC)

The Block Primary Health Centre (BPHC) is the cornerstone of rural health services at the Community Development Block level (covering approximately **1,00,000 population**). It acts as a referral unit for 6 Sub-centres and provides curative, preventive, and promotive healthcare.

**Key Functions:**

1.  **Medical Care:**
    *   OPD services and 24-hour emergency services.
    *   In-patient services (typically 4–6 beds, upgraded to 30 if functioning as a [[Community Health Centre]]).
    *   Referral services for complications from sub-centres.

2.  **Maternal and Child Health (MCH):**
    *   **Antenatal Care:** Early registration, regular check-ups, and identification of [[High Risk Pregnancy]].
    *   **Intranatal Care:** 24-hour delivery services (Institutional Delivery).
    *   **Postnatal Care:** Initiation of breastfeeding and newborn care.
    *   **Child Health:** Promotion of growth monitoring, nutrition, and care of the sick child (IMNCI).

3.  **Family Planning:**
    *   Promotion of spacing methods and sterilization (Tubectomy/Vasectomy).
    *   Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) services.

4.  **Control of Communicable Diseases:**
    *   Implementation of national programs for Malaria, TB, Leprosy, HIV/AIDS, etc.
    *   Notification and containment of epidemics.

5.  **Vital Statistics:**
    *   Collection and reporting of births and deaths.
    *   Maintenance of records regarding morbidity and mortality in the block.

6.  **Health Education:**
    *   Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) activities regarding hygiene, nutrition, and prevention of diseases.

7.  **Environmental Sanitation:**
    *   Testing water quality (disinfection) and promoting basic sanitation.

8.  **Training and Supervision:**
    *   The Medical Officer supervises the field staff (Health Assistants, ANMs).
    *   Training of [[ASHA]], Anganwadi workers, and Dais.

### 2. National Programs Under a BPHC

The BPHC is the peripheral implementing agency for virtually all National Health Programs. Important ones include:

| **Category** | **Programs** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Communicable Diseases** | • **[[NTEP]]**: National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (DOTS Centre).<br>• **[[NVBDCP]]**: National Vector Borne Disease Control Program (Malaria, Dengue, Filaria).<br>• **[[NLEP]]**: National Leprosy Eradication Program.<br>• **[[NACP]]**: National AIDS Control Program (ICTC/PPTCT services). |
| **Non-Communicable** | • **[[NP-NCD]]** (formerly NPCDCS): Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, CVD, and Stroke.<br>• **[[NPCBVI]]**: National Program for Control of Blindness and Visual Impairment.<br>• **[[NMHP]]**: National Mental Health Program. |
| **RCH & Nutrition** | • **[[RMNCAH+N]]**: Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child, Adolescent Health and Nutrition.<br>• **[[UIP]]**: Universal Immunization Program.<br>• **[[NIDDCP]]**: National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Program. |

### 3. Record Linkage

**Definition:**
Record linkage is the process of bringing together records relating to one individual (or one family) that originate in different times or places.

**Key Concepts:**
*   **"Womb to Tomb"**: Ideally, it implies the assembly and maintenance of a file for each individual in a population containing important health records from birth to death.
*   **Events Recorded:** Birth, marriage, death, hospital admissions, discharge summaries, and sickness absence.
*   **Method:** It involves assigning a unique identification number to individuals to link their data across various health facilities.

**Utility in Public Health:**
*   Studying the natural history of chronic diseases.
*   Identifying genetic/familial disease patterns (e.g., twins studies).
*   Measuring morbidity and survival rates.

*Note:* In developing countries like India, full-scale record linkage is difficult due to the massive volume of data, though initiatives like **ABHA ID** (Ayushman Bharat Health Account) are modern steps toward this goal.

### 4. Tracking of Beneficiaries (Maternal & Child Health)

**Concept:**
This refers to the **Name-Based Tracking** system (often utilizing web-based applications like **MCTS** - Mother and Child Tracking System or **RCH Portal**) to ensure the delivery of the full spectrum of healthcare services to pregnant women and children.

**Process:**
1.  **Registration:** Every pregnant woman is registered with a unique ID upon conception.
2.  **Tracking:** She is tracked throughout the pregnancy for:
    *   Antenatal Check-ups (ANC).
    *   Institutional Delivery.
    *   Postnatal Care (PNC).
3.  **Child Tracking:** The newborn is tracked for:
    *   Birth registration.
    *   Full Immunization (up to 3 years/5 years).

**Objectives:**
*   To ensure **Continuum of Care**.
*   To identify and reach "Left-outs" (those who never accessed services) and "Drop-outs" (those who started but didn't finish the schedule).
*   To monitor severely anaemic women and low birth weight babies.
*   To reduce [[MMR]] and [[IMR]] by ensuring timely intervention.

> **Clinical Relevance:** Tracking allows the ANM to generate a "Due List" for the upcoming month, ensuring she knows exactly which mother needs a TT injection or which child needs a measles vaccine, thereby improving coverage rates.
