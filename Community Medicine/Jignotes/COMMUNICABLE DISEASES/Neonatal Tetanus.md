# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Neonatal Tetanus

# [[Neonatal Tetanus]] (Tetanus Neonatorum)

Also known as the **"8th Day Disease"** (in Punjab) because the first symptom usually appears around the 7th or 8th day after birth. It is a highly fatal toxic disease caused by *Clostridium tetani* affecting newborns.

### Epidemiological Determinants

| Factor | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Agent** | [[Clostridium tetani]]: Gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-bearing organism. The spores are terminal, giving a **"drum-stick"** appearance. |
| **Toxin** | Produces a potent exotoxin called **[[Tetanospasmin]]**. It blocks inhibition of spinal reflexes. |
| **Reservoir** | Soil and dust (spores survive for years). Intestine of herbivorous animals. |
| **Mode of Transmission** | Infection of the **[[umbilical stump]]**. Caused by cutting the cord with unsterile instruments (unclean razor/blade) or applying cow dung, ash, or mud to the stump. |
| **Incubation Period** | Usually **6–10 days** (Range: 3–28 days). Shorter incubation indicates higher mortality. |

### Clinical Features and Diagnosis

The diagnosis is primarily clinical.

*   **Initial Period:** The newborn usually sucks and cries normally for the first **2 days** of life.
*   **Onset:**
    *   The first sign is often the **inability to suck** (due to trismus/lockjaw) occurring between day 3 and 28,.
    *   This is followed by generalized rigidity and convulsive **spasms**.
*   **Classic Signs:**
    *   **[[Trismus]]** (Lockjaw).
    *   **Risus Sardonicus:** Sustained spasm of facial muscles producing a grinning expression.
    *   **[[Opisthotonos]]**: Arching of the back due to spasm of extensor muscles.
*   **Fatality:** Without treatment, case fatality is >95%; with treatment, it ranges from 10-90%.

**Standard Case Definition (WHO):**
A confirmed case is an infant with a normal ability to suck and cry during the first 2 days of life, who between 3 and 28 days of age cannot suck normally and becomes stiff or has spasms.

### Management

Excellent nursing care is critical.

1.  **General Care:**
    *   Isolate in a quiet, dark room to avoid stimuli that trigger spasms.
    *   Avoid unnecessary handling.
2.  **Neutralization of Toxin:**
    *   **[[Human Tetanus Immunoglobulin]] (TIG):** 250–500 IU (Best prophylactic/therapeutic agent).
    *   **Equine Antitoxin (ATS):** 1,500–10,000 units if TIG is not available (Risk of anaphylaxis; requires test dose),.
3.  **Antibiotics:**
    *   To halt production of toxin.
    *   **[[Penicillin G]]** or **Erythromycin** for 7 days,.
4.  **Control of Spasms:** Sedatives and muscle relaxants (e.g., Diazepam).
5.  **Feeding:** Nasogastric feeding may be required due to trismus.

> **Clinical Relevance:** Recovery from tetanus **does not** confer natural immunity. Therefore, primary immunization is indicated after recovery.

### Prevention and Control

The elimination of Neonatal Tetanus (NNT) is a major public health goal. Prevention relies on two pillars: **Clean Delivery** and **Maternal Immunization**.

#### 1. The "Cleans" of Safe Delivery
To prevent infection of the umbilical cord, the **"5 Cleans"** must be maintained during delivery,.

**Mnemonic: "Handy Surface Blade Ties Stump"**
*   **C**lean **H**ands (of the birth attendant).
*   **C**lean **S**urface (for delivery).
*   **C**lean **B**lade (for cutting the cord).
*   **C**lean Cord **T**ie.
*   **C**lean Cord **S**tump (No application of anything on the stump).

*(Note: Under RCH-III, "7 Cleans" are proposed, adding Clean Water and Clean Towel).*

#### 2. Maternal Immunization
Immunizing the mother with **[[Tetanus Toxoid]] (TT/Td)** transfers antibodies to the fetus, protecting the newborn.

*   **Schedule:**
    *   **Dose 1:** Early in pregnancy (16–20 weeks).
    *   **Dose 2:** 4 weeks after the first dose (preferably at least 3 weeks before delivery).
    *   **Booster:** If previously fully immunized within the last 3 years, only one booster dose is needed.

#### 3. Strategies for Elimination
*   Promotion of institutional deliveries.
*   Training of Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs) in clean delivery practices.
*   Supply of **[[Disposable Delivery Kits]] (DDKs)**.

### Elimination Status

**Definition of NNT Elimination:** Less than **1 case per 1000 live births** in every district of the country.

*   **Status in India:**
    *   India was declared **Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus Eliminated (MNTE)** in **August 2015**,.
    *   WHO certified this status on **14th July 2016**.
