# [[Sexual Jurisprudence]] > Virginity and Defloration

### Definitions

*   **[[Virginity]] (Virgo Intacta):** A female who has never experienced [[sexual intercourse]].
*   **Defloration:** The loss of virginity, usually accompanied by the rupture of the hymen.
*   **Marriage:** A legal contract implying physical union by coitus.
*   **Divorce:** Dissolution of a valid marriage.

### Anatomy of Female Genitals in a Virgin

1.  **Labia Majora:** Thick, firm, elastic, rounded, and fleshy. They lie in close apposition, completely covering the labia minora and vaginal orifice.
2.  **Labia Minora:** Soft, small, pinkish, and sensitive. Not visible externally as they are covered by labia majora.
3.  **Clitoris:** Small.
4.  **Posterior Commissure and Fourchette:** Intact.
5.  **Fossa Navicularis:** A boat-shaped depression present between the fourchette and the hymen. It disappears after defloration.
6.  **Vagina:** Narrow, tight, and rugose (prominent mucosal folds). The walls are approximated.
7.  **[[Hymen]]:** A membranous fold of mucous membrane situated at the vaginal orifice. It is the most significant sign of virginity, though not absolute.

### The Hymen

The hymen is a thin fold of mucous membrane varying in shape, consistency, and thickness.

#### Types of Hymen
> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> different shapes of hymen: Annular, Crescentic, Cribriform, Septate, Imperforate

1.  **Annular:** Circular opening in the center.
2.  **Semilunar/Crescentic:** Opening is anterior; most common type.
3.  **Vertical:** Opening is a vertical slit.
4.  **Septate:** Two openings separated by a bridge of tissue.
5.  **Cribriform:** Multiple small openings (sieve-like).
6.  **Imperforate:** No opening (causes cryptomenorrhea/hematocolpos).
7.  **Elastic/Fleshy:** Stretches without rupturing during intercourse (leads to "False Virgin").
8.  **Fimbriated:** Irregular edges, often mistaken for rupture.

> **Mnemonic for Hymen Types:** **SCARS** (Septate, Crescentic/Circular, Annular, Ruthless/Rigid, Sieve-like/Cribriform).

#### Hymenal Rupture
*   **Cause:** Usually ruptures at the first act of coitus.
*   **Site:** Most commonly ruptures in the **posterolateral** quadrants (4, 5, 7, or 8 o'clock positions).
*   **Healing:** Edges heal but do not reunite.
*   **Carunculae Myrtiformes:** After childbirth, the hymen is completely destroyed, leaving nodular remnants called carunculae myrtiformes.

**Differentiation between Hymenal Tear and Natural Notch**

| Feature | Hymenal Tear (Rupture) | Natural Notch |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Site** | Usually Posterolateral | Usually Anterior |
| **Extension** | Extends up to the vaginal wall | Does not extend to the vaginal wall |
| **Symmetry** | Asymmetrical | Usually Symmetrical |
| **Edges** | Edges may overlap; scar tissue present | Mucous membrane intact continuous over edges |
| **Mechanism** | Trauma/Intercourse | Congenital |

### Diagnosis of Virginity

The diagnosis is based on the physical examination of breasts and genitals.

**Difference between a Virgin and a Deflorated Woman**

| Feature | Virgin | Deflorated Woman |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Breasts** | Hemispherical, firm, rounded. Nipples small. | Often pendulous/lax. Nipples larger. |
| **Labia Majora** | Thick, firm, close apposition. | Lax, separated. |
| **Labia Minora** | Covered by majora. | Visible externally. |
| **Vaginal Orifice** | Closed/Narrow. | Open/gaping. |
| **Hymen** | Intact. | Ruptured (edges torn). |
| **Rugae** | Prominent. | Smoothed out/less prominent. |
| **Fourchette** | Intact. | May be torn. |
| **Fossa Navicularis**| Present. | Disappears. |
| **Vaginal Canal** | Tight, admits one finger with difficulty. | Lax, admits two or more fingers easily. |

### Classification of Virgins

1.  **True Virgin:** A female with an intact hymen who has never had sexual intercourse.
2.  **False Virgin:** A female with an intact hymen despite having engaged in sexual intercourse. This occurs when the hymen is loose, elastic, or fleshy and dilates without rupturing.
3.  **Deflorated/Non-Virgin:** A female whose hymen is ruptured due to intercourse.

### Causes of Hymenal Rupture other than Intercourse
Hymen rupture is **not** conclusive proof of loss of virginity because it can rupture due to:
1.  **Accidental:** Fall on a projecting object (straddle injury), gymnastics, cycling, vigorous exercise.
2.  **Masturbation:** Insertion of fingers or foreign bodies.
3.  **Medical Procedures:** Speculum examination, D&C, or insertion of tampons.
4.  **Congenital:** Occasionally absent.

### Medicolegal Aspects

The examination for virginity is required in the following civil and criminal cases:

1.  **Nullity of Marriage/Divorce:** If a husband claims the wife was not a virgin at the time of marriage (though legally, lack of virginity is rarely a ground for nullity unless specified by specific personal laws regarding fraud).
2.  **[[Rape]]:** To determine if the victim was a virgin prior to the assault (relevant for assessing injury severity).
3.  **Defamation:** If an unmarried woman is accused of unchastity.
4.  **Impure/False Virgin:** It is possible for a woman to be habituated to sexual intercourse and yet retain an intact hymen (elastic hymen). Conversely, a virgin may have a ruptured hymen due to non-sexual causes.

> **Medicolegal Pearl:** The presence of an intact hymen is a *presumption* of virginity but not absolute proof. The absence of an intact hymen is *not* absolute proof of defloration.

### Signs of Recent Defloration
(Relevant in cases of recent sexual assault on a virgin):
1.  **Hymen:** Fresh tears, tender, red, inflamed edges. Bleeding or blood clots may be present.
2.  **Vagina:** Swollen, tender, and painful.
3.  **Pain:** Pain on walking or sitting (waddling gait).
4.  **Healing:** Tears heal within 2-3 days; inflammation subsides in a few days.
