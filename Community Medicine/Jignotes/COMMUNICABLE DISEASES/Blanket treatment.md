# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Blanket treatment

### **Blanket Treatment (Mass Treatment)**

**Definition**
Blanket treatment, also known as **[[Mass Treatment]]**, refers to the administration of drugs to the **entire community** or a specific population group irrespective of whether individuals have the disease or not,. It is a strategy used when case-finding is difficult or costly, and the risk of infection is high,.

**Rationale**
*   **Iceberg Phenomenon:** The logic is based on the existence of latent (hidden) infections. For every clinical case, there may be 4–5 cases of latent infection in the community.
*   **Interruption of Transmission:** By treating everyone, the **[[reservoir of infection]]** is reduced, preventing further spread,.
*   **Operational Feasibility:** It avoids the complex and expensive process of screening every individual in highly endemic areas.

### **Indications and Examples**

Blanket treatment is primarily used for diseases like Trachoma, Yaws, Filariasis, and Malaria.

#### **1. Trachoma**
*   **Criteria:** If the prevalence of severe and moderate trachoma in children (under 10 years) is **> 5%**,.
*   **Regimen:** Application of **1% [[Tetracycline]] eye ointment**:
    *   Twice daily for 5 consecutive days each month for 6 months OR
    *   Once daily for 10 days each month for 6 consecutive months.

#### **2. Yaws (Endemic Treponematosis)**
WHO recommends treatment policies based on prevalence,,:

| Type of Area | Prevalence of Clinically Active Yaws | Strategy | Target Group |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hyper-endemic** | **> 10%** | **Total Mass Treatment (TTT)** | Entire population (Active cases + Contacts + Healthy) |
| **Meso-endemic** | **5 – 10%** | **Juvenile Mass Treatment (JMT)** | All cases + All children < 15 years + Obvious contacts |
| **Hypo-endemic** | **< 5%** | **Selective Mass Treatment (SMT)** | All cases + Household contacts + Obvious contacts |

*   **Drug of Choice:** Benzathine Penicillin or oral **[[Azithromycin]]**.

#### **3. Lymphatic Filariasis**
*   **Strategy:** **[[Mass Drug Administration (MDA)]]**.
*   **Method:** Administration of **[[DEC]]** (Diethylcarbamazine) + Albendazole to the entire population (except children <2 years, pregnant women, and seriously ill).
*   **Goal:** To interrupt transmission by reducing microfilaria load,.
*   **Variant:** Use of **DEC-medicated salt** (common salt medicated with 0.2–0.4% DEC) for 6–9 months is a special form of mass treatment,.

#### **4. Malaria**
*   **Indication:** In highly endemic areas (API > 5 per 1000 population).
*   **Concept:** Mass prophylaxis or presumptive treatment to reduce the parasite reservoir.

#### **5. Scabies**
*   **Strategy:** Treatment is often applied to the entire household or close contacts simultaneously to prevent re-infection, as it is a water-washed disease with high transmission rates,.

### **Clinical Relevance & Drawbacks**

*   **Clinical Relevance:** In conditions like **Scabies**, treating only the symptomatic patient often leads to failure due to re-infection from asymptomatic family members. Blanket treatment ensures the "ping-pong" transmission stops.
*   **Drawbacks:**
    *   Risk of developing **[[Drug Resistance]]** if treatment is inadequate.
    *   Waste of resources on healthy individuals.
    *   Potential for adverse drug reactions in healthy people.

### **Mnemonic**

To remember diseases using Blanket Treatment: **"T**he **M**ass **F**ly **Y**ells"

*   **T** - **T**rachoma
*   **M** - **M**alaria
*   **F** - **F**ilariasis
*   **Y** - **Y**aws
