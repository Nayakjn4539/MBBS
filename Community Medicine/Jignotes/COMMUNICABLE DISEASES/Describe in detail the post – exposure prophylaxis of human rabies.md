# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Describe in detail the post – exposure prophylaxis of human rabies

### Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) of Human Rabies

**Aim:** To neutralize the inoculated virus before it can enter the nervous system and to prevent the onset of symptoms, as [[Rabies]] is virtually 100% fatal once symptoms appear.

[[Post-exposure prophylaxis]] consists of three main pillars:
1.  **Local Wound Management**
2.  **Passive Immunization** (Rabies Immunoglobulin - RIG)
3.  **Active Immunization** (Anti-Rabies Vaccine - ARV)

---

### 1. Local Treatment of Wound (First Aid)
This is the **most important** step and should be done immediately. It can reduce the viral load by up to 80%.

*   **Cleansing:** Immediate flushing and washing of the wound(s) for a minimum of **15 minutes** with plenty of soap and running water.
*   **Chemical Treatment:** After washing, apply a virucidal agent such as:
    *   70% Alcohol
    *   Tincture or aqueous solution of **Povidone Iodine**.
*   **Suturing:** **Avoid** suturing immediately. If necessary (e.g., severe bleeding), it should be done 24–48 hours later. If suturing is unavoidable, infiltrate [[Rabies Immunoglobulin]] (RIG) around the wound before applying minimum loose stitches.
*   **Antibiotics/Tetanus:** Administer Tetanus Toxoid (TT) and antibiotics if indicated to prevent sepsis.

> **Clinical Relevance:** Never cauterize the wound or apply turmeric/chili powder. Simple washing is far more effective.

### 2. Risk Stratification (Categorization of Exposures)
Treatment depends on the severity of the contact.

| Category | Type of Contact | Recommended PEP |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Category I** | • Touching or feeding animals<br>• Licks on **intact** skin | **None** (if reliable history) |
| **Category II** | • Nibbling of uncovered skin<br>• Minor scratches or abrasions **without bleeding** | • Wound Management<br>• **Anti-Rabies Vaccine (ARV)** immediately |
| **Category III** | • Single/multiple transdermal bites or scratches<br>• Licks on **broken skin**<br>• Contamination of mucous membranes (e.g., eyes, mouth) with saliva<br>• **All** bites from wild animals (e.g., bats, foxes) | • Wound Management<br>• **Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG)**<br>• **Anti-Rabies Vaccine (ARV)** |

> **Note:** In immunocompromised individuals (e.g., HIV/AIDS), even Category II exposures are treated as Category III (Vaccine + RIG).

---

### 3. Passive Immunization: Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG)
RIG provides immediate antibodies (passive immunity) to neutralize the virus at the wound site before the vaccine-induced antibodies are produced (which takes ~7 days).

*   **Indication:** All **Category III** exposures and Category II in immunocompromised patients.
*   **Timing:** Administer as soon as possible (Day 0). Can be given up to **7 days** after the first vaccine dose. After Day 7, RIG is not indicated as active antibodies are presumed to be present.
*   **Dosage:**
    *   **Human Rabies Immunoglobulin (HRIG):** 20 IU/kg body weight.
    *   **Equine Rabies Immunoglobulin (ERIG):** 40 IU/kg body weight.
*   **Administration:** Infiltrate as much as possible **into and around the wound**. Any remaining amount should be injected IM at a site distant from the vaccine site (e.g., gluteal).

---

### 4. Active Immunization: Anti-Rabies Vaccine (ARV)
Modern [[Cell Culture Vaccines]] (CCVs) like Purified Chick Embryo Cell (PCEC) or Purified Vero Cell vaccines are used.

*   **Site:** Deltoid muscle (Adults) or Anterolateral thigh (Infants/Children).
*   **Contraindication:** Never give in the **Gluteal region** (lower antibody response).
*   **Pregnancy:** Rabies vaccine is **safe** and mandatory in pregnancy if exposed.

#### A. Intramuscular (IM) Regimens

1.  **Essen Regimen (5-Dose Schedule):**
    *   Standard Gold Standard.
    *   **Dose:** 1 vial (0.5 ml or 1.0 ml depending on brand) IM.
    *   **Days:** **0, 3, 7, 14, and 28**.
    *   *Mnemonic:* **037-1428** (Like a phone number).

2.  **Zagreb Regimen (Modified 2-1-1 Schedule):**
    *   Saves visits (only 3 visits).
    *   **Day 0:** 2 doses (One in Right deltoid, One in Left deltoid).
    *   **Day 7:** 1 dose.
    *   **Day 21:** 1 dose.

#### B. Intradermal (ID) Regimen
Cost-effective as it uses less vaccine volume (0.1 ml per site). Requires specific training.

1.  **Updated Thai Red Cross Regimen (2-2-2-0-2):**
    *   **Dose:** 0.1 ml ID per site.
    *   **Sites:** 2 sites (Left and Right Deltoid).
    *   **Days:** **0, 3, 7, and 28**.
    *   (Note: The dose on Day 28 is the final one; Day 14 is skipped).

---

### 5. Prophylaxis for Re-exposure (Previously Vaccinated)
For individuals who have documentation of a **complete** course of pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis in the past.

*   **Treatment:** Only **Wound Management** + **Vaccine**.
*   **RIG is NOT required**.
*   **Schedule:**
    *   **Regimen:** 2 doses.
    *   **Days:** Day **0** and Day **3**.
    *   **Route:** Can be IM or ID.
