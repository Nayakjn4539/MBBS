# Common Zoonotic Diseases

**Zoonoses** are defined as those diseases and infections which are naturally transmitted between vertebrate animals and man. They constitute a major public health problem, with over 150 diseases recognized as zoonotic.

### Classification of Zoonoses

Zoonoses can be classified based on the direction of transmission or the life cycle of the infecting organism.

#### 1. Based on Direction of Transmission
*   **[[Anthropozoonoses]]:** Infections transmitted from **animals to man**.
    *   *Examples:* Rabies, Plague, Anthrax, Hydatid disease.
*   **[[Zooanthroponoses]] (Reverse Zoonoses):** Infections transmitted from **man to animals**.
    *   *Examples:* Human Tuberculosis in cattle, Human diphtheria in calves.
*   **[[Amphixenoses]]:** Infections maintained in both man and lower vertebrates that may be transmitted in **either direction**.
    *   *Examples:* *Trypanosoma cruzi*, *Schistosoma japonicum*.

#### 2. Based on Life Cycle (Epidemiological Classification)

| Type | Definition | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Direct Zoonoses** | Transmitted from infected vertebrate to susceptible host by direct contact, fomite, or mechanical vector. No developmental change of agent occurs. | [[Rabies]], [[Brucellosis]], [[Anthrax]] |
| **Cyclo-Zoonoses** | Requires more than one vertebrate host species (but no invertebrate host) to complete the developmental cycle. | [[Taeniasis]], [[Echinococcosis]] |
| **Meta-Zoonoses** | Transmitted biologically by invertebrate vectors. The agent multiplies or develops in the vector (Extrinsic incubation period). | [[Plague]], [[Arboviral infections]], [[Schistosomiasis]] |
| **Sapro-Zoonoses** | Requires a vertebrate host and a non-animal developmental site (soil, organic matter, plants). | [[Mycoses]], [[Larva migrans]] |

> **Mnemonic for Bacterial Zoonoses:** **B-PLAGUE**
> **B**rucellosis
> **P**lague
> **L**eptospirosis
> **A**nthrax
> **G**landers
> **U**ndulant Fever (Brucellosis)
> **E**ndemic Typhus (Murine)

# Epidemiology of Rabies

**Rabies** (Hydrophobia) is an acute, highly fatal viral disease of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by *Lyssavirus type 1*. It is a dead-end infection in humans.

### 1. Epidemiological Determinants

**A. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** [[Lyssavirus type 1]] (Family: *Rhabdoviridae*). It is a bullet-shaped, neurotropic RNA virus.
*   **Resistance:** The virus is rapidly inactivated by sunlight, heat, and disinfectants (soap, ethanol, iodine).
*   **Virus Types:**
    *   *Street Virus:* Freshly isolated from natural cases; variable incubation period; produces Negri bodies.
    *   *Fixed Virus:* Lab-adapted by serial passage; short, fixed incubation period (4-6 days); used for **vaccine production**.

**B. Host Factors**
*   **Reservoir:** Domestic and wild animals. In India, **dogs** are responsible for 99% of human infections.
*   **Susceptibility:** All warm-blooded animals are susceptible. It is most common in children aged 5-14 years.

**C. Mode of Transmission**
1.  **Animal Bites:** Most common route (dog bites).
2.  **Licks:** On abraded skin or mucous membranes.
3.  **Aerosols:** Rare; possible in caves with infected bats.
4.  **Person-to-Person:** Rare; theoretically possible; documented via corneal/organ transplantation.

**D. Incubation Period**
*   Highly variable; commonly **1–3 months** (can range from 4 days to years).
*   *Depends on:* Site of bite (closer to brain = shorter IP), severity of wound, and amount of virus injected.

### 2. Clinical Features
*   **Prodrome:** Fever, headache, malaise, pain/tingling at the bite site.
*   **Acute Neurologic Phase:** Excitation, agitation, confusion.
*   **Hydrophobia:** Fear of water; spasms of pharyngeal muscles upon seeing or trying to drink water (Pathognomonic sign).
*   **Aerophobia:** Fear of drafts of air/fanning.
*   **Coma and Death:** Invariably fatal once symptoms appear.

# Prevention of Rabies

Prevention is based on **Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)**, as there is no cure once symptoms manifest. Every animal bite should be treated as a medical emergency.

### Step 1: Local Treatment of Wound (First Aid)
**This is the most important step.**
*   **Immediate Washing:** Flush and wash the wound with plenty of soap and running water for at least **15 minutes**.
*   **Chemical Treatment:** Apply virucidal agents like 70% alcohol or Povidone-Iodine.
*   **Suturing:** **Avoided** if possible. If necessary, suture loosely only after infiltrating [[Rabies Immunoglobulin]] (RIG) around the wound.

### Step 2: Categorization of Exposure & Management
Decide the treatment based on the severity of contact.

| Category | Type of Contact | Recommended PEP |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Category I** | Touching/feeding animals, licks on **intact** skin. | **None** (Wash exposed skin). |
| **Category II** | Nibbling of uncovered skin, minor scratches/abrasions **without bleeding**. | **Vaccine** + Wound Management. |
| **Category III** | Transdermal bites/scratches (single/multiple), licks on **broken skin**, contamination of mucous membranes, **bat** exposure. | **Vaccine + Immunoglobulin (RIG)** + Wound Management. |

> *Note:* All bites by wild animals are treated as Category III.

### Step 3: Passive Immunization (Rabies Immunoglobulin - RIG)
*   **Indication:** Mandatory for all Category III exposures.
*   **Timing:** Administer as soon as possible (Day 0). Not indicated beyond Day 7 of starting the first vaccine dose.
*   **Dosage:**
    *   Human RIG (HRIG): **20 IU/kg** body weight.
    *   Equine RIG (ERIG): **40 IU/kg** body weight.
*   **Administration:** Infiltrate as much as possible **into and around the wound**. Inject the remainder IM at a site distant from the vaccine (gluteal region preferred for remainder).

### Step 4: Active Immunization (Anti-Rabies Vaccine - ARV)
Modern Cell Culture Vaccines (CCV) are used (e.g., Purified Chick Embryo Cell Vaccine, Purified Vero Cell Vaccine).

**A. Intramuscular (IM) Regimen (Essen Regimen)**
*   **Schedule:** 5 Doses.
*   **Days:** **0, 3, 7, 14, 28**.
*   **Site:** Deltoid (Adults), Anterolateral thigh (Children). **NEVER** in the gluteal region (buttocks) as absorption is poor.

**B. Intradermal (ID) Regimen (Updated Thai Red Cross)**
*   **Schedule:** 2-2-2-0-2.
*   **Days:** **0, 3, 7, 28**.
*   **Dose:** 0.1 ml per site.
*   **Sites:** Two sites (one on each deltoid) per visit.
*   *Advantage:* Saves vaccine volume (cost-effective).

**C. Re-exposure Prophylaxis** (For previously immunized individuals)
*   **Requirement:** Documented proof of full vaccination.
*   **Regimen:** Two doses (IM or ID) on **Day 0 and Day 3**.
*   **RIG:** Not required for re-exposure.

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Observation Period:** If the biting dog/cat is available, observe for **10 days**. If the animal remains healthy, PEP can be discontinued (applicable to dogs/cats only).
*   **Pre-exposure Prophylaxis:** Recommended for high-risk groups (vets, lab workers, animal handlers).
    *   *Schedule:* Days 0, 7, and 21 (or 28).
