# [[Principles Of Epidemiology And Epidemiologic Methods]] > Definition and Aims of Epidemiology

### Definition and Aims of Epidemiology

#### **1. Etymology and Historical Evolution**
The term **Epidemiology** is derived from three Greek words:
*   **Epi**: Among, upon
*   **Demos**: People
*   **Logos**: Study

Historically, the definition has evolved from a focus solely on epidemics to a broader scope encompassing all health-related events:
*   **Parkin (1873):** Branch of medical science which treats epidemics.
*   **Frost (1927):** Science of mass phenomena of infectious diseases.
*   **Greenwood (1934):** Study of disease as a mass phenomenon.
*   **MacMahon (1960):** Study of the distribution and determinants of disease frequency in man.

#### **2. Standard Definition**
The most widely accepted modern definition is given by **John M. Last (1988)**:

> "The study of the **distribution** and **determinants** of **health-related states or events** in **specified populations**, and the **application** of this study to the **control** of health problems."

#### **3. Components of Epidemiology**
To understand the definition, it is broken down into key components:

**1. Disease Frequency**
*   Measurement of the frequency of disease, disability, or death.
*   Summarized using **[[Rates, Ratios, and Proportions]]** (e.g., prevalence rate, incidence rate, death rate).
*   Essential for comparing disease frequency in different populations to identify important clues to etiology.

**2. Distribution of Disease**
*   Diseases are not uniformly distributed. Epidemiology studies patterns in relation to:
    *   **Time:** When does the disease occur? (Seasonal, cyclic, secular trends).
    *   **Place:** Where is it occurring? (Geographical variation).
    *   **Person:** Who is affected? (Age, sex, occupation).
*   This aspect is known as **[[Descriptive Epidemiology]]**.

**3. Determinants of Disease**
*   Identifies the underlying causes or **[[Risk Factors]]**.
*   Tests etiological hypotheses.
*   This aspect is known as **[[Analytical Epidemiology]]**.

**4. Health-related States and Events**
*   Epidemiology is not limited to disease (pathology) but includes:
    *   **States:** Health status, physiological conditions (e.g., blood pressure, pregnancy).
    *   **Events:** Injury, accidents, vital events (birth, death).

**5. Specified Populations**
*   The unit of study is a **defined population** or **[[Population at Risk]]**, not an individual.

**6. Application to Control**
*   The ultimate aim is not just to study but to apply knowledge to promote, protect, and restore health.

**Mnemonic for Definition Components:**
**3 D's** of Epidemiology:
1.  **D**istribution (Time, Place, Person)
2.  **D**eterminants (Causes/Risk Factors)
3.  **D**isease Frequency (Rates/Ratios)

#### **4. Aims of Epidemiology**
According to the **[[International Epidemiological Association (IEA)]]**, the three main aims are:

1.  **Describe Distribution and Magnitude:**
    To describe the distribution and size of health and disease problems in human populations. (Who, where, and when).

2.  **Identify Etiological Factors:**
    To identify **[[Risk Factors]]** or etiological agents in the pathogenesis of disease. (Why and how).

3.  **Provide Data for Planning and Evaluation:**
    To provide essential data for planning, implementation, and **[[Evaluation]]** of services for the prevention, control, and treatment of disease and setting priorities.

**Ultimate Aim:**
To eliminate or reduce the health problem or its consequences and to promote the health and well-being of society as a whole.

#### **5. Epidemiology vs. Clinical Medicine**
The approach of an epidemiologist differs significantly from that of a clinician:

| Feature | **Clinical Medicine** | **Epidemiology** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unit of Study** | The **Case** (Individual patient) | The **[[Defined Population]]** or Population-at-risk |
| **Primary Concern** | Disease in the individual | Disease patterns in the entire population (Mass phenomenon) |
| **Objective** | Diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of the patient | Identification of source, mode of spread, and etiology for control measures |
| **Approach** | Patient comes to the doctor | Investigator goes out into the community |
| **Tools** | Clinical and laboratory examinations (Stethoscope, Thermometer) | Biostatistics, Tables, Graphs, Maps (Conceptual tools) |
| **Concept** | Often concerned with **[[Pathogenesis]]** | More concerned with **[[Prepathogenesis]]** |
| **Outcome** | Diagnosis and Cure | **[[Community Diagnosis]]** and Prevention/Control |

---

#### **6. Clinical Relevance**
Understanding epidemiology is crucial for a clinician because:
*   It completes the **[[Natural History of Disease]]** by identifying subclinical cases not seen in hospitals.
*   It helps in determining the **prognosis** of a disease.
*   It provides knowledge on **preventive measures** to advise patients (e.g., smoking cessation to prevent lung cancer).
