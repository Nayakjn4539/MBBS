# [[Preventive Medicine In Obstetrics, Paediatrics And Geriatrics]] > Universal Immunization Program and NIS

# **Universal Immunization Program (UIP)**

The [[Universal Immunization Program]] (UIP) is one of the largest public health interventions in the world. It was launched in India in **1985** (renamed from the Expanded Program on Immunization - EPI, started in 1978) to reduce mortality and morbidity due to **Vaccine Preventable Diseases (VPDs)**. It is currently a key component of the [[National Health Mission]] (NHM) under the RMNCH+A strategy.

### **Objectives of UIP**
1.  Rapidly increase immunization coverage.
2.  Improve the quality of services.
3.  Establish a reliable cold chain system.
4.  Achieve self-sufficiency in vaccine production.
5.  Reduction of IMR (Infant Mortality Rate) and U5MR (Under-5 Mortality Rate).

### **Diseases Covered Under UIP**
Currently, the program provides free vaccines against **12 life-threatening diseases**:
*   **Nationally:** [[Diphtheria]], [[Pertussis]], [[Tetanus]], [[Poliomyelitis]], [[Measles]], [[Rubella]], severe form of Childhood [[Tuberculosis]], [[Hepatitis B]], [[Meningitis]] & Pneumonia caused by *Haemophilus influenzae* type B.
*   **Sub-nationally (Selected States/Districts):** [[Rotavirus Diarrhea]], [[Pneumococcal Pneumonia]], [[Japanese Encephalitis]] (JE).

### **Key Vaccines and Updates**

1.  **[[Pentavalent Vaccine]]:**
    *   **Combination:** Diphtheria + Pertussis + Tetanus + Hepatitis B + Hib.
    *   **Benefit:** Reduces the number of pricks for the child.
    *   **Storage:** Freeze sensitive (Do not freeze).

2.  **[[Inactivated Polio Vaccine]] (IPV):**
    *   **Reason:** Part of the Polio Endgame Strategy to mitigate risks of Vaccine-Derived Polio Virus (VDPV) after the switch from Trivalent OPV to Bivalent OPV.
    *   **Dose:** Fractional dose (0.1 ml) is used intradermally (fIPV) because it provides better immunogenicity than a single intramuscular dose. A **3rd dose** of fIPV has been introduced at 9 months.

3.  **Measles-Rubella (MR) Vaccine:**
    *   Replaced the monovalent Measles vaccine to target Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS).
    *   **Open Vial Policy:** NOT applicable (Reconstituted vaccine must be used within 4 hours).

4.  **[[Rotavirus Vaccine]] (RVV):**
    *   Prevents severe diarrhea causing dehydration.
    *   **Administration:** 5 drops orally (Liquid) or 2.5 ml (Lyophilized).
    *   **Caution:** Risk of intussusception (rare).

5.  **[[Mission Indradhanush]]:**
    *   Launched in Dec 2014.
    *   **Goal:** To cover all children and pregnant women who are either unvaccinated or partially vaccinated ("Catch-up" campaign).
    *   **Target:** Full immunization coverage >90%.

### **The Cold Chain**

The system of storing and transporting vaccines at recommended temperatures from the manufacturer to the point of use.

*   **Standard Temperature in India:** **+2°C to +8°C**.
*   **Key Equipment:**
    *   **[[Walk-In Coolers]] (WIC):** Regional/State level. Storage for 3 months.
    *   **[[Ice Lined Refrigerator]] (ILR):** District and PHC level. Maintains temperature for long durations even without electricity (hold-over time). **Most important component**.
    *   **[[Deep Freezer]]:** Used for making ice packs and storing Polio vaccine at district level.
    *   **[[Vaccine Carrier]]:** For carrying vaccines to outreach sessions (Sub-centers/Villages). Contains 4 conditioned ice packs. Holdover time: 12 hours.

### **Vaccine Vial Monitor (VVM)**

A heat-sensitive label on vaccine vials to monitor cumulative heat exposure.

*   **Grade I:** Inner square lighter than outer circle $\rightarrow$ **USE.**
*   **Grade II:** Inner square slightly darker but still lighter than outer circle $\rightarrow$ **USE.**
*   **Grade III:** Inner square matches outer circle color $\rightarrow$ **DISCARD.**
*   **Grade IV:** Inner square darker than outer circle $\rightarrow$ **DISCARD.**

---

### **Open Vial Policy**

Allows the use of opened multi-dose vials for up to **28 days** in subsequent sessions, *provided* specific conditions are met (expiry not passed, VVM valid, cold chain maintained).

*   **Applicable to:** DPT, Td, TT, Hep B, OPV, Pentavalent, PCV, IPV.
*   **NOT Applicable to:** Measles, BCG, JE (Reconstituted vaccines), and Rotavirus (Check specific manufacturer instructions for Rota).

### **Clinical Relevance & Contraindications**

1.  **Pregnancy:** **Live vaccines** (Measles, Rubella, Mumps, Varicella) are generally **contraindicated** (except Yellow Fever if high risk). Td is the vaccine of choice.
2.  **HIV Positive Child:**
    *   Asymptomatic: Give all vaccines as per schedule.
    *   Symptomatic: **Do not** give BCG or Yellow Fever. Measles can be given.
3.  **Adverse Events Following Immunization ([[AEFI]]):**
    *   **Anaphylaxis:** Rare but severe. Treat with Adrenaline (1:1000) IM.
    *   **Abscess:** Due to non-sterile technique (Program error).
