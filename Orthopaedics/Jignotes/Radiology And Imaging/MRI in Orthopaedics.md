# [[Radiology And Imaging]] > MRI in Orthopaedics

### Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in Orthopaedics

[[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI) is a sophisticated, non-invasive diagnostic modality that has revolutionized orthopaedics by providing superior contrast resolution for soft tissues compared to [[computed tomography]] (CT) or plain radiography. Unlike X-rays, MRI does not utilize ionizing radiation.

#### Basic Principles
MRI relies on radio-frequency emissions from atoms and molecules (specifically hydrogen nuclei) in tissues exposed to a static magnetic field.
*   **Mechanism:** The patient is placed in a strong magnetic field. Radio waves are pulsed, causing hydrogen protons to align. When the pulse stops, protons return to equilibrium, emitting signals detected by the scanner.
*   **Tissue Appearance:**
    *   **High Intensity (Bright/White):** Tissues containing abundant hydrogen, such as fat, cancellous bone, and [[bone marrow]].
    *   **Low Intensity (Black/Dark):** Tissues containing little hydrogen, such as [[cortical bone]], ligaments, tendons, and air.
    *   **Intermediate (Grey):** Cartilage, spinal canal, and muscle.
*   **Pulse Sequences:** By adjusting parameters, specific tissues can be highlighted (e.g., T1-weighted for anatomy, T2-weighted for pathology/fluid).

#### Clinical Applications in Orthopaedics

**1. Spinal Disorders**
MRI is the "Gold Standard" and investigation of choice for spinal pathology. It has largely replaced myelography.
*   **[[Intervertebral Disc Prolapse]] (IVDP):** It clearly displays disc hydration, protrusion, extrusion, or sequestration. It identifies nerve root compression and the status of the [[thecal sac]].
*   **Spinal Infection ([[Tuberculosis of Spine]]):**
    *   MRI detects infection early (marrow edema).
    *   It delineates the extent of **paravertebral abscesses**.
    *   It is crucial for evaluating **[[spinal cord compression]]** and the health of the neural tissue (myelomalacia).
    *   *Differentiation:* It helps distinguish between tuberculosis (discs involved) and metastatic disease (discs usually spared).
*   **[[Spinal Trauma]]:** Evaluates ligamentous disruption (posterior ligament complex) and spinal cord injury (edema vs. hemorrhage) even without radiographic bony abnormality ([[SCIWORA]]).

**2. Joint Injuries (Sports Medicine)**
*   **[[Knee Joint]]:**
    *   **Menisci:** MRI is as accurate as [[arthroscopy]] for diagnosing **[[meniscal tears]]**. It helps grade the degeneration.
    *   **Ligaments:** Diagnoses tears of the **[[anterior cruciate ligament]] (ACL)**, **[[posterior cruciate ligament]] (PCL)**, and collateral ligaments.
    *   **Bone Bruising:** Detects trabecular microfractures (bone bruises) often seen in ACL injuries, which are invisible on X-ray.
*   **[[Shoulder Joint]]:** Useful for diagnosing **[[rotator cuff tears]]** and labral injuries (e.g., Bankart lesions).
*   **[[Ankle Joint]]:** Visualizes ligament injuries and osteochondral defects.

**3. Bone Tumors**
MRI is essential for the **staging** of bone tumors.
*   **Extent:** It defines the intramedullary and extraosseous (soft tissue) extent of the tumor.
*   **Skip Lesions:** It detects **[[skip lesions]]** (satellite tumor foci) within the same bone, which is critical for planning the level of amputation or limb salvage.
*   **Tissue Characterization:** Helps differentiate tissue types (e.g., fat in lipoma, fluid in cysts).

**4. Bone Infections ([[Osteomyelitis]])**
*   **Early Diagnosis:** MRI detects marrow edema and pathological changes *before* they appear on plain X-rays (which may take 2 weeks).
*   **Differentiation:** It helps distinguish between cellulitis (soft tissue only) and osteomyelitis (bone involvement).
*   **Chronic Infection:** Useful in planning surgery by showing the extent of bone destruction, hidden abscesses, and **[[sequestrum]]**.

**5. Osteonecrosis ([[Avascular Necrosis]])**
*   **Early Detection:** MRI is the *only* reliable method to detect **[[osteonecrosis]]** (e.g., of the femoral head) in the pre-radiological stage (Ficat and Arlet Stage I).
*   **Appearance:** Typically shows a "double line sign" or a hypointense band on T1-weighted images outlining the ischemic segment.

**6. Occult Fractures**
*   Detects **[[stress fractures]]** (e.g., tibia, metatarsals) and **[[scaphoid fractures]]** that are not visible on initial X-rays due to its sensitivity to edema and hemorrhage.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Advantages** | • **No Ionizing Radiation:** Safe for repeated use.<br>• **Multi-planar:** Can image in sagittal, coronal, and axial planes without moving the patient.<br>• **Soft Tissue Contrast:** Superior definition of muscles, nerves, discs, and ligaments.<br>• **Marrow Sensitivity:** Detects infiltration, edema, and ischemia early. |
| **Disadvantages** | • **Cost:** Expensive investigation.<br>• **Availability:** Limited in rural/remote settings.<br>• **Time:** Scans take longer than CT/X-ray.<br>• **Claustrophobia:** Closed gantry can cause anxiety in patients.<br>• **Implants:** Cannot be used with ferromagnetic implants (e.g., pacemakers, cochlear implants). |

### Clinical Implications and Precautions
*   **Implants:** Stainless steel implants cause significant artifact and may heat up or move; **[[Titanium]]** implants are generally MRI-compatible and produce less artifact.
*   **Contrast:** **Gadolinium** contrast can be used to differentiate vascularized tissue (tumor/infection) from avascular fluid (abscess/cyst) or to outline joint structures in **MR [[Arthrography]]**.
*   **Interpretation:** MRI is highly sensitive but can be non-specific. Findings must always be correlated with clinical history and examination to avoid treating "incidentalomas" (asymptomatic findings).
