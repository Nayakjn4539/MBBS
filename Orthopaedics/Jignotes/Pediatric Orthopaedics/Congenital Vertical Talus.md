# Congenital Vertical Talus (Rocker Bottom Foot)

### Introduction and Definition
[[Congenital vertical talus]] (CVT), also known as **Congenital Convex Pes Valgus** or **Teratological Dislocation of the Talonavicular Joint**, is a rare and rigid foot deformity. It is characterized by a fixed dorsal dislocation of the [[navicular]] on the neck of the [[talus]], resulting in a convex plantar surface (rocker-bottom appearance).

### Etiology
The condition may occur in isolation (idiopathic) or, more commonly, in association with other neuromuscular or genetic disorders.
*   **Idiopathic:** Approximately 50% of cases.
*   **Associated Conditions:**
    *   [[Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita]] (AMC).
    *   [[Neural tube defects]] (e.g., [[myelomeningocele]], [[spina bifida]]).
    *   [[Neurofibromatosis]].
    *   [[Spinal muscular atrophy]].
    *   Genetic syndromes (e.g., Trisomy 18).

### Pathoanatomy
The deformity is complex, involving both bony malalignment and soft tissue contractures.

**1. Bony Deformities**
*   **Talus:** Fixed in extreme plantar flexion (vertical position).
*   **Navicular:** Dislocated dorsally onto the neck of the talus. This locks the talus in the vertical position.
*   **Calcaneus:** Fixed in [[equinus]] (plantar flexion) and valgus.
*   **Forefoot:** Dorsiflexed and abducted at the midtarsal joint.

**2. Soft Tissue Contractures**
The dorsal and lateral soft tissues are shortened, preventing reduction:
*   **Contracted Tendons:** [[Tibialis anterior]], [[Extensor hallucis longus]] (EHL), [[Extensor digitorum longus]] (EDL), [[Peroneus brevis]].
*   **Contracted Ligaments:** Dorsal talonavicular ligament, calcaneofibular ligament.
*   **Posterior Contracture:** The [[tendo-achilles]] and posterior ankle capsule are contracted, causing hindfoot equinus.

### Clinical Features
The diagnosis is usually obvious at birth due to the characteristic shape of the foot.
*   **Rocker Bottom Deformity:** The sole of the foot is convex.
*   **Rigidity:** The deformity is rigid and cannot be passively corrected (unlike [[calcaneovalgus foot]]).
*   **Talar Head Prominence:** The head of the [[talus]] is palpable as a round, hard prominence on the medial and plantar aspect of the midfoot.
*   **Hindfoot:** The heel is in equinus (pointing downwards) and valgus, though the equinus might be masked by the abundance of heel pad fat.
*   **Forefoot:** Abducted and dorsiflexed.
*   **Creases:** Deep creases may be present on the dorsolateral aspect of the foot.

**Clinical Implication:** Always examine the spine and hips and perform a general neurological exam when CVT is identified, as it is frequently a sentinel sign for spinal dysraphism or neuromuscular disorders.

### Imaging and Diagnosis
Plain x-rays are crucial for diagnosis and for differentiating CVT from other conditions.

**1. Anteroposterior (AP) View**
*   **Talocalcaneal Angle:** Increased (Kite’s angle > 40 degrees), indicating hindfoot valgus.
*   **Talo-1st Metatarsal Angle:** The axis of the talus passes medial to the first metatarsal shaft.

**2. Lateral View (Standard)**
*   **Vertical Talus:** The long axis of the talus is almost parallel to the tibia.
*   **Dorsal Navicular:** Though the navicular is unossified in infants, the first metatarsal (which aligns with the navicular) is displaced dorsally relative to the talus.
*   **Calcaneal Equinus:** The anterior end of the calcaneus is plantarflexed.

**3. Lateral View in Forced Plantar Flexion (The Diagnostic Test)**
This is the **single most important view** to differentiate CVT from [[Congenital Oblique Talus]].
*   **CVT:** The [[talonavicular joint]] **does not reduce**. The axis of the first metatarsal remains dorsal to the axis of the talus.
*   **Oblique Talus:** The deformity reduces; the axes align effectively.

**4. Lateral View in Forced Dorsiflexion**
*   Demonstrates the fixed equinus of the [[calcaneus]]; the hindfoot does not dorsiflex, only the midfoot breaks (spurious correction).

### Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Rigidity | Radiographic Finding (Forced Plantar Flexion) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Congenital Vertical Talus]]** | Rigid | **Irreducible**: Talo-1st MT axis does not align. |
| **[[Congenital Oblique Talus]]** | Flexible | **Reducible**: Talo-1st MT axis aligns. |
| **[[Calcaneovalgus Foot]]** | Flexible | Normal talonavicular relationship; extreme dorsiflexion possible. |
| **Iatrogenic Rocker Bottom** | Variable | History of forceful correction of [[CTEV]] (Clubfoot) without correcting varus/adduction first. |

### Treatment
The goal is to restore the anatomical relationship between the talus, navicular, and calcaneus.

#### 1. Non-Operative Treatment
*   **Manipulation:** Generally starts at birth. The foot is stretched into plantar flexion and inversion (reverse of clubfoot manipulation) to stretch the dorsal soft tissues.
*   **Serial Casting:** The **Reverse Ponseti Technique** (Dobbs method) is increasingly used. It involves serial casting to stretch the dorsolateral tissues, followed by limited surgery (pinning).
*   **Role:** Rarely curative on its own but facilitates easier surgical reduction by stretching tight skin and tendons.

#### 2. Operative Treatment
Surgery is usually required, typically performed between **6 to 12 months** of age.
*   **Single-Stage Soft Tissue Release (Open Reduction):**
    *   **Dorsal Release:** Lengthening of toe extensors ([[EHL]], [[EDL]]) and [[tibialis anterior]]. Release of the dorsal talonavicular capsule.
    *   **Reduction:** The [[navicular]] is reduced onto the head of the [[talus]] and fixed with a **Kirschner wire ([[K-wire]])**.
    *   **Posterior Release:** Lengthening of the [[tendo-achilles]] and release of the posterior ankle capsule to correct the equinus.
    *   **Subtalar Release:** Often required to correct the valgus and reduce the calcaneus under the talus.
*   **Minimally Invasive Method (Dobbs):**
    *   Serial casting to reduce the talonavicular joint.
    *   Percutaneous **K-wire fixation** of the talonavicular joint.
    *   Percutaneous **Achilles tenotomy** to correct equinus.
*   **Tendon Transfer:** In older children (2-4 years), the [[tibialis anterior]] tendon may be transferred to the neck of the talus to help support the head.
*   **Bony Procedures:** In older children (> 4-6 years) or neglected cases, soft tissue release alone is insufficient.
    *   **Naviculectomy:** Excision of the navicular (rarely done now).
    *   **Triple Arthrodesis:** Fusion of subtalar, talonavicular, and calcaneocuboid joints (reserved for skeletal maturity/adolescents).

### Complications
*   **Undercorrection:** Recurrence of deformity.
*   **Avascular Necrosis (AVN):** Of the [[talus]] due to extensive soft tissue stripping.
*   **Stiffness:** Reduced range of motion in the ankle and subtalar joints.
*   **Persistent Flatfoot:** Loss of the medial longitudinal arch.
