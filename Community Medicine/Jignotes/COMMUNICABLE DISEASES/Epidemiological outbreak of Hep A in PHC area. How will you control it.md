# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Epidemiological outbreak of Hep A in PHC area. How will you control it

### Control of Hepatitis A Outbreak in a PHC Area

**[[Hepatitis A]]** is an acute infectious disease caused by the [[Enterovirus 72]] (Picornaviridae family). Outbreaks are typically associated with poor sanitation and are transmitted primarily via the **[[faecal-oral route]]**.

To control an outbreak in a Primary Health Centre (PHC) area, a systematic epidemiological approach is required, focusing on the Reservoir, Mode of Transmission, and Susceptible Host.

---

### 1. Verification and Notification
*   **Verification of Diagnosis:**
    *   The Medical Officer must confirm the diagnosis serologically.
    *   **Gold Standard:** Detection of **[[IgM anti-HAV antibody]]** in the serum of acutely ill patients.
    *   Liver function tests (ALT/AST) will show elevation, but are non-specific.
*   **Notification:**
    *   [[Hepatitis A]] is a **notifiable disease**.
    *   Report the outbreak immediately to the District Health Authority/IDSP (Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme).

---

### 2. Control of Reservoir (The Source)
Since humans are the only reservoir, measures must focus on cases.

*   **Identification of Cases:**
    *   Conduct a house-to-house survey (Active Surveillance) by Health Workers/ASHAs to detect mild, missed, or **[[anicteric cases]]** (common in children).
    *   **Note:** There is **NO** chronic carrier state in Hepatitis A.
*   **Isolation:**
    *   Strict isolation is generally not required, but **[[enteric isolation]]** is recommended.
    *   Prevent contacts from coming into contact with the patient's faeces, blood, and body fluids.
    *   **Duration:** For 2 weeks after onset of symptoms or 1 week after onset of **[[jaundice]]**.
*   **Disinfection:**
    *   **Concurrent Disinfection:** Sanitary disposal of faeces and urine is critical.
    *   **Disinfectant:** 0.5% **[[Sodium Hypochlorite]]** is highly effective.
    *   Boiling of syringes, needles, and instruments for 10 minutes or autoclaving.

### 3. Interruption of Transmission (The Environment)
This is the most critical step to halt a common-source epidemic.

#### A. Water Safety
*   **Chlorination:** Ensure adequate chlorination of community water supplies.
    *   **Requirement:** A free **[[residual chlorine]]** level of **1 mg/L** for 30 minutes at pH < 8.5 is required to inactivate the virus.
*   **Boiling:** During epidemics, advise the community to drink **boiled water** (boiling for 5-10 minutes kills the virus).
*   **Source Protection:** Identify and seal sources of sewage contamination (e.g., leakages in pipelines near latrines).

#### B. Food Hygiene
*   Prohibit sale of cut fruits, unfiltered juices, and open food items.
*   Strict supervision of food handlers; exclude infected handlers from work.
*   Wash vegetables and fruits thoroughly with clean water.

#### C. Sanitation
*   Promote hand washing with soap and water before eating and after defecation (the most effective simple measure).
*   Sanitary disposal of excreta via sanitary latrines to prevent contamination of soil and water.

### 4. Protection of Susceptible Host

#### A. Passive Immunization (IG)
*   **Agent:** Human **[[Normal Immunoglobulin]]** (pooled gamma globulin).
*   **Indication:** Household contacts, pregnant women, and outbreak control in institutions (schools/hostels).
*   **Dose:** **0.02 - 0.05 ml/kg** body weight intramuscularly.
*   **Timing:** Must be given within **2 weeks** of exposure to be effective (efficacy 80-90%).
*   **Duration of Protection:** Temporary (3-5 months).

#### B. Active Immunization (Vaccine)
*   **Agent:** Formaldehyde **[[Inactivated Hepatitis A Vaccine]]** or Live Attenuated Vaccine.
*   **Role in Outbreak:** Can be used for post-exposure prophylaxis (if given early) and long-term protection.
*   **Schedule:** 2 doses, 6-18 months apart.

---

### 5. Health Education (IEC)
Conduct awareness campaigns focusing on:
*   **Hand Hygiene:** "Wash hands with soap" is the primary message.
*   **Safe Water:** Drink only boiled or chlorinated water.
*   **Sanitation:** Avoid open defecation.

### Summary Table: Outbreak Management

| Component | Action Required |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Diagnosis** | Detect **[[IgM anti-HAV]]**; Identify anicteric cases in children. |
| **Isolation** | Enteric isolation for 1 week after jaundice onset. |
| **Water** | Super-chlorination (**1 mg/L** residual chlorine). |
| **Prophylaxis**| Human Normal Immunoglobulin for close contacts (< 2 weeks exposure). |
| **Hygiene** | Hand washing and sanitary waste disposal. |

### Mnemonics
**"WASTE"** to control Hep A:
*   **W** - **W**ater safety (Chlorination/Boiling).
*   **A** - **A**ntibodies (Immunoglobulin for contacts).
*   **S** - **S**anitation (Faecal disposal).
*   **T** - **T**reat/Test (Supportive care/IgM testing).
*   **E** - **E**ducation (Hand washing).

**Clinical Relevance:**
*   **[[Anicteric Hepatitis]]**: In children, Hepatitis A is often asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice). During an outbreak in a school or PHC area, do not rely solely on jaundice to identify cases; look for fever, anorexia, and nausea.
*   **Pregnant Women:** Hepatitis A is generally benign, unlike **[[Hepatitis E]]**, which has high mortality (fulminant hepatic failure) in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy.
