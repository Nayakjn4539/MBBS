# Acute Diarrhoeal Diseases

### Definition
[[Acute Diarrhoeal Disease]] is defined as the passage of loose, liquid, or watery stools, usually **more than three times a day**. However, it is the recent change in consistency and character of stools rather than the mere number of stools that is the most important feature.

### Clinical Types of Diarrhoeal Disease
It is practical to base treatment on the clinical type of illness:
1.  **Acute Watery Diarrhoea:** Lasts several hours to days. The main danger is [[dehydration]]; weight loss also occurs if feeding is not continued. Common pathogens: *Rotavirus, E. coli, V. cholerae*.
2.  **Acute Bloody Diarrhoea ([[Dysentery]]):** Diarrhoea with visible blood in stools. Main dangers are damage to intestinal mucosa, sepsis, and malnutrition. Common pathogen: *Shigella*.
3.  **Persistent Diarrhoea:** Begins acutely but lasts **14 days or longer**. Main danger is malnutrition and serious non-intestinal infection.
4.  **Diarrhoea with Severe Malnutrition:** Associated with marasmus or kwashiorkor. Risks include severe systemic infection, dehydration, and heart failure.

### Epidemiological Determinants

#### 1. Agent Factors
In developing countries, diarrhoea is almost universally infectious in origin.
*   **Viruses:** [[Rotavirus]] (leading cause of severe dehydrating diarrhoea in children <5 years), Astroviruses, Adenoviruses.
*   **Bacteria:** *Campylobacter jejuni*, [[Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli]] (ETEC), *Shigella*, *Salmonella*, *Vibrio cholerae* O1 and O139.
*   **Protozoa:** *Entamoeba histolytica*, *Giardia intestinalis*.
*   **Reservoir:** For most enteric pathogens (e.g., *Shigella*, *V. cholerae*, *Giardia*), **man** is the principal reservoir.

#### 2. Host Factors
*   **Age:** Most common in children between **6 months and 2 years**. Incidence is highest at 6–11 months (weaning period) due to declining maternal antibodies and introduction of contaminated food.
*   **Malnutrition:** A vicious circle exists; malnutrition leads to infection, and infection leads to diarrhoea.
*   **Immunity:** Gastric acidity acts as a barrier; reduced acidity increases susceptibility.

#### 3. Environmental Factors
*   **Seasonality:** Bacterial diarrhoeas peak in warmer/rainy seasons; Viral diarrhoeas (Rotavirus) peak in winter.
*   **Poverty & Sanitation:** Poor environmental sanitation, lack of safe water, and unsafe excreta disposal are major contributors.

### Transmission
*   **Route:** Primarily **Faecal-Oral route**.
*   **Modes:**
    *   **Water-borne:** Contaminated water supply.
    *   **Food-borne:** Contaminated food, milk, vegetables.
    *   **Direct transmission:** Fingers, fomites, dirt (ingested by young children).

**Mnemonic for Transmission: The 6 F's**
*   **F**aeces
*   **F**luids
*   **F**ingers
*   **F**lies
*   **F**omites
*   **F**ood

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a diagram of the "Sanitation Barrier" showing the 6 F's connecting Faeces to the New Host, and where the barrier (latrine/hygiene) breaks this chain.

### Incubation Period
Variable depending on the agent:
*   **Cholera:** Few hours to 5 days.
*   **Rotavirus:** ~2 days.
*   **Salmonella:** 12–24 hours.

### Clinical Assessment of Dehydration
Assessment is critical to select the Treatment Plan (A, B, or C). Based on the **"Look, Feel, Decide"** principle.

| Sign | **No Dehydration (Plan A)** | **Some Dehydration (Plan B)** | **Severe Dehydration (Plan C)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Condition** | Well, Alert | Restless, Irritable | Lethargic, Unconscious, Floppy |
| **Eyes** | Normal | Sunken | Very Sunken and Dry |
| **Tears** | Present | Absent | Absent |
| **Mouth/Tongue** | Moist | Dry | Very Dry |
| **Thirst** | Drinks normally | **Thirsty, drinks eagerly** | **Drinks poorly / unable to drink** |
| **Skin Pinch** | Goes back quickly | Goes back slowly | Goes back **very slowly** (>2 secs) |
| **Pulse** | Normal | Rapid | Rapid, weak/feeble |

**Mnemonic for Dehydration Signs: "D-R-Y"**
*   **D**epressed fontanelle/eyes (Sunken)
*   **R**educed turgor (Skin pinch goes back slowly)
*   **Y**earning for water (Thirsty) or **Y**ucky feeling (Lethargic/Unconscious)

### Management and Treatment

#### 1. [[Oral Rehydration Therapy]] (ORT)
The cornerstone of management. It prevents dehydration and reduces mortality.
*   **Composition:** **New Reduced Osmolarity [[ORS]]** (WHO recommended).

| Component | Grams/Litre | Component (mmol/L) | Concentration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Sodium Chloride | 2.6 | Sodium | 75 |
| Glucose (Anhydrous) | 13.5 | Glucose | 75 |
| Potassium Chloride | 1.5 | Potassium | 20 |
| Trisodium Citrate | 2.9 | Citrate | 10 |
| | | Chloride | 65 |
| **Total Osmolarity** | | **245 mmol/L** | |

*   **Mechanism:** Glucose coupled sodium transport enhances intestinal absorption of fluid.
*   **Shelf Life:** After mixing, solution should be used within **24 hours**.

#### 2. Treatment Plans
*   **Plan A (No Dehydration):** Treat at **home**.
    *   **Rule 1:** Give more fluids (Home Available Fluids like rice water, dal water, buttermilk, ORS).
    *   **Rule 2:** Continue feeding (Breastfeeding is crucial).
    *   **Rule 3:** Watch for danger signs.
*   **Plan B (Some Dehydration):** Treat at **health facility** with ORS.
    *   Amount: 75 ml/kg over 4 hours.
*   **Plan C (Severe Dehydration):** Treat quickly with **IV Fluids**.
    *   Fluid of choice: [[Ringer's Lactate]] (Hartmann's solution).
    *   If RL not available, Normal Saline can be used (but doesn't correct acidosis).
    *   Amount: 100 ml/kg (divided into bolus and maintenance).

#### 3. [[Zinc Supplementation]]
*   **Importance:** Reduces duration and severity of the episode and prevents subsequent episodes for 2-3 months.
*   **Dosage:**
    *   **< 6 months:** 10 mg/day for 14 days.
    *   **> 6 months:** 20 mg/day for 14 days.

#### 4. Antibiotics (Chemotherapy)
*   **Not indicated routinely.** Unnecessary use causes resistance.
*   **Indications:**
    *   Cholera: Doxycycline (Adults), Azithromycin (Children/Pregnant women).
    *   Shigella dysentery: Ciprofloxacin.
*   **Contraindicated drugs:** Neomycin, Purgatives, Anti-motility drugs (Loperamide/Opioids), Steroids.

#### 5. Nutrition Management
*   **"Resting the gut" is wrong.**
*   Continue breastfeeding.
*   Give soft, mashed, easily digestible food.
*   Extra meal daily for 2 weeks after recovery to regain lost weight.

### Prevention and Control

#### 1. Primary Prevention
*   **Sanitation:** Sanitary disposal of excreta, hand washing (interrupts faecal-oral transmission).
*   **Water:** Access to safe, potable water (Chlorination, boiling).
*   **Breastfeeding:** Exclusive breastfeeding for first 6 months protects against gastrointestinal infections.
*   **Immunization:**
    *   **Rotavirus Vaccine:** Oral, live attenuated. Included in National Immunization Schedule.
    *   **Measles Vaccine:** Prevents measles-associated diarrhoea (up to 25% reduction in diarrhoeal deaths).
*   **Vitamin A:** Supplementation reduces severity and complications.

#### 2. Secondary Prevention
*   Early recognition of dehydration signs by mothers.
*   Prompt use of ORS and Zinc.

### Diarrhoeal Diseases Control Programme (Integrated into RCH/NHM)
*   **Goal:** To reduce mortality due to dehydration and morbidity due to diarrhoea.
*   **Key Strategy:** Promotion of ORT and Zinc use.
*   **IDCF:** Intensified Diarrhoea Control Fortnight observed in July-August focusing on ORS/Zinc distribution and hygiene.
