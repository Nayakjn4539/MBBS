# [[Ear]] > Glomus Tumors

### Glomus Tumors (Paragangliomas)

**Glomus tumors** are benign, slow-growing, encapsulated, highly vascular, and locally invasive tumors arising from the **paraganglionic cells** (glomus bodies).

---

### **Overview and Etiopathology**

*   **Origin:** Derived from **neural crest cells**. In the temporal bone, they arise from glomus bodies located along:
    *   **Jacobson’s nerve** (tympanic branch of [[Glossopharyngeal nerve]] - CN IX) $\rightarrow$ [[Glomus Tympanicum]].
    *   **Arnold’s nerve** (auricular branch of [[Vagus nerve]] - CN X) at the [[Jugular bulb]] $\rightarrow$ [[Glomus Jugulare]].
*   **Nature:** They are **non-chromaffin** tumors (usually non-hormone secreting), but functional activity (secreting catecholamines) can occur.
*   **Demographics:** Most common in **females** (F:M ratio 3:1 to 5:1), typically in the **4th to 5th decade** (middle age).
*   **Histology:** Consists of masses of epithelial cells (Chief cells) with granular cytoplasm separated by a stroma rich in thin-walled vascular sinusoids (responsible for profuse bleeding).
*   **Blood Supply:** Primarily from the **ascending pharyngeal artery** (branch of [[External Carotid Artery]]).

#### **The "Rule of 10s" for Paragangliomas**
*   **10%** are **Familial** (Autosomal dominant).
*   **10%** are **Multicentric** (e.g., concurrent [[Carotid Body Tumor]] or [[Pheochromocytoma]]).
*   **10%** are **Functional** (secrete catecholamines leading to hypertension/palpitations).
*   **10%** are **Malignant** (metastasize).

### **Classification**

#### **Anatomical Classification**
| Type | Origin Site | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Glomus Tympanicum]]** | Promontory (along Tympanic plexus) | Confined to [[Middle Ear]]. Presents early with aural symptoms. |
| **[[Glomus Jugulare]]** | Dome of [[Jugular Bulb]] | Invades hypotympanum, jugular foramen, and skull base. Causes cranial neuropathies. |

#### **Fisch Classification (Surgical Staging)**
This is widely used to categorize tumor spread and determine the surgical approach.

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Type A** | Tumor limited to the **middle ear cleft** (Glomus Tympanicum). |
| **Type B** | Tumor limited to **tympanomastoid area**; no bone destruction in the infralabyrinthine compartment. |
| **Type C** | Tumor involving the **infralabyrinthine compartment** and extending into the petrous apex. |
| *C1* | Limited involvement of the vertical portion of the [[Carotid Canal]]. |
| *C2* | Invading the vertical portion of the carotid canal. |
| *C3* | Invading the horizontal portion of the carotid canal. |
| **Type D** | Tumor with **intracranial extension** (intradural). |
| *D1* | Intracranial extension < 2 cm. |
| *D2* | Intracranial extension > 2 cm. |

### **Clinical Features**

#### **Symptoms**
1.  **Pulsatile Tinnitus:** Earliest and most common symptom. It is synchronous with the pulse and may be temporarily stopped by carotid pressure.
2.  **Hearing Loss:** Usually **Conductive Hearing Loss** (CHL) due to mass effect in the middle ear. [[Sensorineural Hearing Loss]] (SNHL) occurs if the labyrinth is invaded.
3.  **Aural Fullness:** Blocked sensation in the ear.
4.  **Otorrhea/Bleeding:** Profuse bleeding if the tumor perforates the tympanic membrane and presents as a polyp in the [[External Auditory Canal]].
5.  **Otalgia:** Pain in the ear.
6.  **Vertigo:** Due to labyrinthine invasion.

#### **Signs (Examination Findings)**
*   **Rising Sun Appearance (Red Reflex):** A reddish-blue mass seen behind the intact [[Tympanic Membrane]], usually arising from the hypotympanum (floor of the middle ear).
*   **Brown’s Sign (Pulsation Sign):** When pressure in the ear canal is increased using a [[Siegel’s Speculum]], the tumor blanches and pulsations become vigorous; reverse occurs on release.
*   **Aquino Sign:** Cessation or reduction of pulsation/tinnitus on compression of the ipsilateral common carotid artery.
*   **Audible Bruit:** A systolic bruit may be heard over the mastoid on auscultation.
*   **Cranial Nerve Palsies:**
    *   **[[Facial Nerve]] (VII):** Palsy due to middle ear/mastoid involvement.
    *   **Jugular Foramen Syndrome:** Involvement of CN IX, X, XI (Dysphagia, hoarseness, aspiration, shoulder weakness).
    *   **Hypoglossal Nerve (XII):** Hemiatrophy of the tongue.

### **Investigations**

**Important:** **Biopsy is CONTRAINDICATED** for a vascular mass in the middle ear due to the risk of profuse, uncontrollable hemorrhage.

1.  **High Resolution CT Scan (HRCT) Temporal Bone:**
    *   Shows extent of bone destruction.
    *   **[[Phelps Sign]]:** Erosion of the **carotico-jugular spine** (crest of bone separating the carotid canal and jugular foramen). This differentiates Glomus Jugulare (eroded) from Glomus Tympanicum (intact).
2.  **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):**
    *   Superior for soft tissue delineation and intracranial extension.
    *   **[[Salt and Pepper Appearance]]:** Characteristic finding on T1/T2 weighted images.
        *   *Salt* (Hyperintense): Due to subacute hemorrhage/slow flow.
        *   *Pepper* (Signal Voids): Due to high velocity blood flow in tumor vessels.
3.  **Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) / 4-Vessel Angiography:**
    *   **Gold Standard** for vascular evaluation.
    *   Identifies the feeding vessel (usually [[Ascending Pharyngeal Artery]]).
    *   Checks for cross-circulation (Circle of Willis) and other paragangliomas (carotid body tumor).
    *   Used for **Pre-operative Embolization**.
4.  **Urine Screening:**
    *   24-hour urinary **VMA (Vanillylmandelic Acid)** and catecholamines to rule out functional (secreting) tumors or associated pheochromocytoma before surgery.

### **Differential Diagnosis**
*   High-riding or Dehiscent [[Jugular Bulb]] (blue mass).
*   Aberrant [[Internal Carotid Artery]].
*   [[Cholesterol Granuloma]] (Blue drum).
*   Middle ear adenoma or carcinoma.

---

### **Management**

#### **1. Surgery**
The primary treatment for young, healthy patients.
*   **Pre-operative Embolization:** Performed 48 hours prior to surgery to reduce bleeding.
*   **Surgical Approaches (Based on Fisch Types):**
    *   **Type A:** Transcanal/Transmeatal approach (Tympanotomy).
    *   **Type B:** Postauricular transmastoid approach (Extended facial recess approach).
    *   **Type C & D:** **Infratemporal Fossa Approach** (Type A) of Fisch.

#### **2. Radiotherapy**
*   Used for elderly patients, those unfit for surgery, unresectable tumors, or residual disease.
*   **Mechanism:** Does not kill the tumor but induces fibrosis and reduces vascularity (arrests growth).
*   **Modality:** Stereotactic Radiosurgery (Gamma Knife) is preferred for tumors < 3cm.

#### **3. "Wait and Scan" (Conservative)**
*   For elderly patients (>65 years) with minimal symptoms and slow-growing tumors.

### **Clinical Implications & Pearls**
*   **Profuse Bleeding:** Never biopsy a red, pulsatile mass in the ear in the OPD. It can be a glomus tumor or an aberrant carotid artery.
*   **Multicentricity:** Always check the neck (carotid body) and abdomen (pheochromocytoma) if a glomus tumor is suspected.
*   **[[Pulsatile Tinnitus]]:** This is an **objective** tinnitus (can be heard by the examiner using a stethoscope/auscultation tube).
