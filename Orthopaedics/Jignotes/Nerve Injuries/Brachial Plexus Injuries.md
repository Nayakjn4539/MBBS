# [[Nerve Injuries]] > Brachial Plexus Injuries

### Brachial Plexus Injuries

The [[brachial plexus]] is a complex network of nerves formed by the anterior rami of nerve roots C5 to T1. Injuries to this structure are devastating, causing significant disability in the upper limb. They range from transient [[neurapraxia]] to complete [[root avulsion]].

#### Relevant Anatomy
*   **Formation:** formed by the union of anterior rami of **C5, C6, C7, C8, and T1**.
    *   **Pre-fixed plexus:** Contribution from C4.
    *   **Post-fixed plexus:** Contribution from T2.
*   **Structure:** The plexus is divided into Roots $\rightarrow$ Trunks $\rightarrow$ Divisions $\rightarrow$ Cords $\rightarrow$ Branches.
    *   **Roots:** C5, C6 join to form Upper Trunk; C7 forms Middle Trunk; C8, T1 join to form Lower Trunk.
    *   **Divisions:** Each trunk divides into Anterior and Posterior divisions.
    *   **Cords:**
        *   **Lateral Cord:** Anterior divisions of Upper and Middle Trunks.
        *   **Medial Cord:** Anterior division of Lower Trunk.
        *   **Posterior Cord:** Posterior divisions of all three trunks.
*   **Location:** The plexus is most vulnerable where it runs from the cervical spine, between the neck muscles, and beneath the [[clavicle]].

#### Mechanisms of Injury
1.  **Closed Injuries (Most Common):**
    *   **Traction/Stretch:** Occurs when the angle between the shoulder and neck widens violently.
        *   *Examples:* Motorcycle accidents (fall on the side of the neck/shoulder), birth trauma (obstetrical palsy).
    *   **Supraclavicular injuries:** Typically high-energy trauma (motorcycle).
    *   **Infraclavicular injuries:** Often associated with [[shoulder dislocation]] or fractures.
2.  **Open Injuries:** Penetrating wounds (stab or gunshot) or during surgical procedures.
3.  **Compression:** Tumors (e.g., Pancoast tumor), [[cervical rib]], or backpack palsy.

#### Classification of Injuries
Injuries are broadly classified based on the anatomical level and the severity of the nerve damage.

##### 1. Based on Anatomical Level
*   **Supraclavicular Lesions:** Involve roots and trunks. Further divided into:
    *   **Preganglionic (Root Avulsion):** Avulsion of nerve roots from the spinal cord. **Irreparable**.
    *   **Postganglionic (Rupture/Stretch):** Lesion distal to the [[dorsal root ganglion]]. **Potentially repairable**.
*   **Infraclavicular Lesions:** Involve cords and branches. Usually associated with shoulder trauma (fractures/dislocations). Better prognosis.

##### 2. Specific Clinical Syndromes

| Syndrome | Level of Injury | Deformity/Alias | Clinical Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Erb's Palsy]]** | **Upper Trunk (C5, C6)** | **Policeman’s Tip / Waiter's Tip / Porter's Tip** | • Arm hangs by side, adducted and internally rotated.<br>• Forearm extended and pronated.<br>• Loss of abduction (Deltoid, Supraspinatus) and external rotation (Infraspinatus).<br>• Loss of elbow flexion (Biceps, Brachialis). |
| **[[Klumpke’s Paralysis]]** | **Lower Trunk (C8, T1)** | **Claw Hand** | • Paralysis of intrinsic muscles of the hand (interossei, lumbricals).<br>• Hyperextension at MCP joints and flexion at IP joints.<br>• Sensory loss along the ulnar border of forearm/hand.<br>• Often associated with **[[Horner’s Syndrome]]**. |
| **Total Plexus Injury** | **C5–T1** | **Flail Limb** | • Complete paralysis and anesthesia of the entire upper limb.<br>• Limb is useless and hangs flaccidly. |

#### Diagnosis and Evaluation

**1. Clinical Assessment**
*   **History:** Mode of injury is crucial (high velocity vs. low velocity).
*   **Inspection:** Look for wasting, posture of the limb (Policeman tip vs. Clawing), and [[Horner's syndrome]] (ptosis, miosis, anhydrosis, enophthalmos).
*   **Neurological Exam:** Test specific dermatomes and myotomes to localize the lesion.
    *   **C5:** Deltoid (Abduction).
    *   **C6:** Biceps (Flexion).
    *   **C7:** Triceps (Extension).
    *   **C8:** Finger flexors.
    *   **T1:** Interossei (Abduction/Adduction).

**2. Distinguishing Preganglionic vs. Postganglionic Lesions**
This distinction is vital for prognosis and surgical planning.

| Feature | **Preganglionic (Root Avulsion)** | **Postganglionic (Rupture/Stretch)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Horner’s Syndrome** | Present (if T1 involved) | Absent |
| **Pain** | Severe, burning pain in anesthetic hand | Variable |
| **Serratus Anterior** | Paralyzed (winged scapula) | Sparing likely (Long thoracic n. arises early) |
| **Rhomboids** | Paralyzed (Dorsal scapular n.) | Sparing likely |
| **Tinel’s Sign** | Absent in neck | Present (implies neuroma formation) |
| **Histamine Test** | **Positive** (Triple response: wheal & flare intact because axon reflex arc is intact distal to ganglion) | **Negative** (No flare, only wheal) |
| **Myelography/MRI** | **[[Pseudomeningocele]]** present | Normal meninges |
| **Prognosis** | Poor (Irreparable) | Better (Surgically repairable) |

**3. Investigations**
*   **X-rays:** Cervical spine (fractures), Shoulder (dislocation), Chest (elevation of diaphragm via phrenic nerve palsy).
*   **MRI:** Gold standard to visualize root avulsions, pseudomeningoceles, and soft tissue damage.
*   **Electrodiagnosis (EMG/NCV):**
    *   Performed 3-4 weeks after injury (to allow Wallerian degeneration).
    *   Helps distinguish between neurapraxia, axonotmesis, and neurotmesis.
    *   **SNAP (Sensory Nerve Action Potential):** Preserved in preganglionic lesions (cell body in dorsal root ganglion is intact) despite clinical anesthesia. Absent in postganglionic lesions.

#### Management

**1. Conservative Management**
*   Indicated for closed injuries, low-velocity trauma, or neurapraxia.
*   **Observation:** Wait for spontaneous recovery (rule of thumb: allow 3 months).
*   **Splinting:** To prevent contractures.
    *   **[[Aeroplane Splint]]** or Shoulder Abduction Splint: For Erb’s palsy to prevent adduction contracture.
    *   **Cock-up Splint:** For radial nerve component (wrist drop).
*   **Physiotherapy:** Passive range of motion (ROM) to maintain joint flexibility and muscle tone. Galvanic stimulation may be used.

**2. Surgical Management**
*   **Indications:**
    *   Open/penetrating injuries (immediate repair).
    *   No signs of recovery after 3 months of conservative care.
    *   Total plexus palsy.
    *   Preganglionic lesions (for nerve transfer).
*   **Timing:** Early exploration (3–6 months) yields better results. Repairs performed after 12–18 months have poor outcomes due to motor end-plate degeneration.

**Surgical Techniques:**
*   **Nerve Repair (Neurorrhaphy):** Direct end-to-end suture if no tension.
*   **[[Nerve Grafting]]:** If a gap exists (e.g., using [[sural nerve]] grafts).
*   **[[Neurolysis]]:** Removal of scar tissue around the nerve to relieve compression.
*   **Nerve Transfers (Neurotization):** Used for root avulsions (irreparable). A functioning nerve is transferred to a non-functioning distal target.
    *   *Example:* Spinal accessory nerve $\rightarrow$ Suprascapular nerve.
    *   *Example:* Intercostal nerves $\rightarrow$ Musculocutaneous nerve.
*   **Muscle/Tendon Transfers:** For late cases (chronic injury) to restore specific functions (e.g., L'Episcopo procedure for external rotation).
*   **Arthrodesis:** Fusion of the shoulder or wrist to provide a stable limb in flail arms.

**Clinical Implications:**
*   **Horner's Syndrome:** Its presence in a brachial plexus injury is a grave prognostic sign indicating T1 root avulsion.
*   **Obstetric Palsy:** Large babies and breech deliveries are risk factors. While many recover, persistent deficits require early microsurgical intervention.
*   **Pain:** Avulsion injuries often cause severe, intractable neuropathic pain (deafferentation pain).
