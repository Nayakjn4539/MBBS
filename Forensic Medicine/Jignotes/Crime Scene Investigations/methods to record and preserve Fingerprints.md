# [[Crime Scene Investigations]] > methods to record and preserve Fingerprints

### Classification of Fingerprints at Crime Scenes

Before recording, the type of fingerprint must be identified:
1.  **Visible ([[Patent fingerprints]]):** Visible to the naked eye. Made by fingers contaminated with coloured substances like blood, ink, grease, dirt, or paint transferred to a surface.
2.  **Plastic ([[Impression fingerprints]]):** Three-dimensional indentations made in soft, pliable materials like wax, soap, butter, putty, or fresh paint.
3.  **[[Latent fingerprints]]:** Invisible or barely visible impressions caused by the transfer of body perspiration (sweat) or oils (sebum) present on finger ridges to a surface. These require **development** techniques to be visualized.

### Methods to Develop and Record Latent Fingerprints

The choice of method depends on the nature of the surface (porous vs. non-porous) and the condition of the print.

#### 1. Physical Methods (Powder Technique)
Used primarily on **non-porous** surfaces (glass, metal, finished wood).
*   **Principle:** The powder adheres to the moisture and oily components of the skin residue.
*   **Application:** A fine camel-hair brush or fibreglass brush is used to lightly dust the area. Excess powder is blown off.
*   **Types of Powders:**
    *   **Black Powder (Charcoal/Carbon):** Used on light-colored surfaces (e.g., white paper, china).
    *   **Grey/Aluminum Powder:** Used on dark-colored surfaces, mirrors, and metal surfaces (photographs well).
    *   **Fluorescent Powder:** Used on multi-colored or chaotic backgrounds; viewed under UV light.
    *   **Magnetic Powder:** Applied with a magnetic wand; less abrasive, good for leather or plastics.

#### 2. Chemical Methods
Used primarily on **porous** surfaces (paper, cardboard, unpainted wood) or for older prints.

| Method | Chemical Agent | Target Component | Resulting Color | Best Surface |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Iodine Fuming** | Iodine crystals | Fatty oils/Grease | Yellowish-Brown (Fugitive/Fades quickly) | Paper, cardboard |
| **Ninhydrin** | Ninhydrin solution | Amino acids | **Ruhemann's Purple** (Deep purple/Blue) | Paper (Old prints) |
| **Silver Nitrate** | AgNO₃ | Chlorides (Salt/Sweat) | Black/Reddish-brown (needs sunlight/UV) | Wood, Paper |
| **Cyanoacrylate** | Superglue fumes | Moisture/Amino acids | Hard White Polymer | Non-porous (Plastic, Glass, Metal) |

> **Mnemonic for Chemical Order:** **I** **N**ever **S**kip **C**hemistry
> *   **I**odine fuming (First, as it is non-destructive but fades)
> *   **N**inhydrin
> *   **S**ilver Nitrate (Last, as it washes away proteins/fats)
> *   **C**yanoacrylate (Superglue fuming - mostly for non-porous)

#### 3. Optical/Modern Methods
*   **LASER (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation):** Detects inherent luminescence of perspiration components or applied fluorescent dyes. Can detect very old prints.
*   **Alternative Light Sources (Polylight):** Uses high-intensity quartz lamps to visualize prints.
*   **Metal Deposition:** Vacuum metal deposition (Gold/Zinc) for extremely difficult surfaces like fabrics.

### Methods of Recording Fingerprints (Living Subjects)

The standard method for creating a permanent record (e.g., for police databases or comparison).

**Requirements:**
*   Unglazed white paper (Standard Fingerprint Form).
*   Printer's ink (Black).
*   Glass slab and rubber roller (to spread ink thinly and evenly).

**Techniques:**
1.  **[[Plain Impression]]:**
    *   The bulb of the finger is inked and pressed directly down on the paper without any rolling motion.
    *   Shows the central pattern but not the complete ridge characteristics.
2.  **[[Rolled Impression]]:**
    *   The finger is inked and rolled from **nail edge to nail edge** (one side to the other) on the paper.
    *   This provides a complete rectangular impression of the ridge pattern (delta to delta).
    *   Crucial for classification and counting ridge details.

### Preservation of Fingerprints

Once a fingerprint is visible (patent) or developed (latent), it must be preserved immediately for legal evidence.

1.  **Photography:**
    *   **Primary Step:** Before any lifting attempt, the print must be photographed.
    *   **Scale:** A ruler/scale must be included in the frame.
    *   **Lighting:** Oblique lighting helps enhance ridge detail.
2.  **Lifting:**
    *   Used for developed latent prints on immovable or large objects.
    *   **Transparent Adhesive Tape:** Placed over the dusted print, smoothed out to remove air bubbles, and peeled off.
    *   **Backing Card:** The tape is pasted onto a card of **contrasting color** (e.g., black powder lift on a white card).
3.  **Cast Making:**
    *   For **plastic prints** (in wax/putty), a cast may be made using silicone rubber or dental stone if photography is insufficient.
4.  **Chain of Custody:**
    *   The lifted print must be labeled with the date, time, location, case number, and collector's signature.

### Medicolegal Aspects: Recording from Cadavers

Forensic pathologists often need to record prints from dead bodies for identification.

**1. Fresh Bodies:**
*   Clean the fingers with soap and water or alcohol to remove rigor mortis stiffness (massage the fingers).
*   Use the standard inking and rolling method. Spoon-shaped tools can be used to hold the paper strip against the finger.

**2. Decomposed/Drowned Bodies:**
*   **Wrinkled Fingers (Washerwoman's hands):** Inject glycerin, water, or melted paraffin wax under the skin of the finger bulb to smooth out wrinkles (Reconditioning).
*   **Peeling Skin (Degloving):** If the epidermis is loose (glove formation), the skin of the finger can be carefully removed.
    *   The operator can wear the skin of the deceased over their own gloved finger to take the print.
    *   Alternatively, the skin is preserved in formalin to harden, and then printed.
*   **Mummified/Dessicated Fingers:** Soaking in 1-3% sodium hydroxide (KOH) or specific fabric softeners to rehydrate the tissue before printing.

### Automated Identification Systems

*   **[[AFIS]] (Automated Fingerprint Identification System):** Computerized system that scans and digitizes fingerprints, creating a spatial map of ridge details (minutiae). It allows rapid comparison against a massive database of known prints.
*   **FACT (Fingerprint Analysis and Criminal Tracing):** System used in India.
*   **[[Live Scan]]:** Inkless electronic capture of fingerprints directly into a computer database.
