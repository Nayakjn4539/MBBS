# [[Irritant Poisons (Plants)]] > Semecarpus Anacardium

### **Semecarpus Anacardium (Marking Nut)**

**Semecarpus anacardium** is an organic irritant poison of plant origin belonging to the family *Anacardiaceae*. It is notoriously known for its use in creating fictitious injuries (artificial bruises) for medicolegal fabrication.

#### **1. Synonyms**
*   Marking nut
*   Dhobi’s nut (used by washermen to mark clothes)
*   Bhilawa
*   Malacca bean
*   Oriental cashew

#### **2. Physical Appearance and Properties**
*   **Fruit/Nut:** Heart-shaped, black in colour with a rough projection at the base.
*   **Pericarp:** Thick and cellular, containing a juice.
*   **Juice:**
    *   Brownish, oily, and acrid.
    *   **Characteristic Feature:** It turns **black** on exposure to air.
    *   Used traditionally by washermen to mark clothes due to its permanent black stain.

#### **3. Active Principles**
The toxic principles are present in the pericarp fluid:
1.  **[[Semecarpol]]** (A monohydroxy phenol)
2.  **[[Bhilawanol]]** (An o-dihydroxy compound)

#### **4. Signs and Symptoms**

**A. External Contact (Local Action)**
*   **Pain:** Burning sensation on contact.
*   **Skin Lesion:** Formation of painful **blisters** containing acrid serum.
*   **Surrounding Area:** Eczematous eruptions, itching, and redness.
*   **Appearance:** The lesion closely resembles a true **[[bruise]]** (contusion) but can be differentiated (see table below).

**B. Ingestion**
*   **Gastrointestinal:**
    *   Blisters in the mouth and throat.
    *   Severe gastric irritation, burning pain in the stomach.
    *   Vomiting and bloody diarrhea.
*   **Systemic:**
    *   Dyspnoea (difficulty breathing).
    *   Tachycardia and hypotension.
    *   Cyanosis.
    *   Delirium, coma, and convulsions.
    *   Oliguria (albuminuria may be present).

#### **5. Fatal Dose and Fatal Period**
*   **Fatal Dose:** Uncertain, but approximately **5 to 10 grams** or **5 to 8 seeds**.
*   **Fatal Period:** **12 to 24 hours**.

#### **6. Treatment**
**A. Skin Contact**
*   Wash the affected area thoroughly with soap and warm water immediately.
*   Bathe the skin in **vinegar** or ice-cold water.
*   Apply **magnesium oxide** paste or bland liniments.

**B. Ingestion**
*   **[[Gastric lavage]]** with warm water (cautiously).
*   **Demulcents:** Milk, egg white, or butter to soothe the mucosa.
*   **Symptomatic management:** [[Morphine]] for pain, fluid replacement for shock and dehydration.

#### **7. Postmortem Findings**
*   **External:**
    *   Presence of blisters on the skin or near the lips/angle of the mouth.
    *   Discoloration of skin (blackish stains).
*   **Internal:**
    *   Mucosa of the mouth, throat, and esophagus may show blisters, inflammation, and congestion.
    *   **Stomach:** Highly congested and inflamed mucosa.
    *   **Viscera:** General congestion of liver, kidneys, and brain.

### **8. Medicolegal Aspects**

1.  **Artificial Bruise (Fabricated Injury):**
    *   The juice is applied to the skin to simulate a bruise to support a false charge of assault.
    *   This is the most common medicolegal significance of this poison.
2.  **Criminal Abortion:**
    *   The juice is applied to an **[[abortion stick]]** and inserted into the cervical os to induce abortion.
    *   Oral ingestion can also be used as an **abortifacient**.
3.  **Cattle Poison:**
    *   Used to kill cattle by administering crushed seeds with fodder or inserting a cloth smeared with juice into the rectum.
4.  **Vitriolage:**
    *   The juice may be thrown on the face to cause injury/disfigurement, similar to acid throwing.
5.  **Quackery:** Accidental poisoning may occur due to administration by quacks for rheumatic pains or worm infestations.

### **9. Difference Between True Bruise and Artificial Bruise**

This is a high-yield exam topic.

| Feature | True Bruise ([[Contusion]]) | Artificial Bruise (Semecarpus/Calotropis) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cause** | Blunt force trauma | Chemical irritants (Bhilawa, Calotropis) |
| **Site** | Anywhere (usually exposed or contact sites) | Usually accessible parts (arms, legs) |
| **Shape** | Round or irregular | Irregular, bizarre shapes; often finger-tip marks |
| **Color Change** | **Present** (Color changes of bruise over time) | **Absent** (Remains dark brown/black) |
| **Itching** | Absent | **Present** (intense itching) |
| **Vesicles/Blisters** | Absent | **Present** (due to chemical irritation) |
| **Inflammation** | Mild | Marked (redness around margins) |
| **Chemical Test** | Negative for plant poisons | **Positive** for Bhilawanol/Semecarpol |
| **Contents** | Extravasated blood in tissues | Acrid serum |

### **Mnemonic**

To remember the Medicolegal aspects of **MARKING** Nut:

*   **M** - **M**arking clothes (Dhobi's nut)
*   **A** - **A**rtificial Bruise (main use)
*   **R** - **R**ectal administration (Cattle poison)
*   **K** - **K**ills fetus (Abortifacient)
*   **I** - **I**rritant (Blisters, itching)
*   **N** - **N**ut is heart-shaped
*   **G** - **G**et vinegar for skin wash
