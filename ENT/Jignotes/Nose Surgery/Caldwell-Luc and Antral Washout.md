# [[Nose Surgery]] > Caldwell-Luc and Antral Washout

# Caldwell-Luc Operation

### Definition
The **[[Caldwell-Luc operation]]** (also known as **Anterior Antrostomy**) is a surgical procedure involving a sublabial approach to the [[maxillary sinus]] through the canine fossa. The maxillary mucosa is radically excised (if diseased), and drainage is established by creating an intranasal antrostomy in the inferior meatus,.

### Indications
While [[Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery]] ([[FESS]]) has largely replaced this procedure for chronic sinusitis, the Caldwell-Luc operation remains relevant for specific conditions,,:

1.  **Chronic Maxillary Sinusitis:** With irreversible mucosal changes (e.g., polypoidal hypertrophy) unresponsive to medical management or FESS.
2.  **Removal of Foreign Bodies:** Such as tooth roots, bullets, or dental paste pushed into the antrum.
3.  **Cysts and Tumors:**
    *   Removal of [[Dental cyst]] or benign tumors/neoplasms.
    *   Recurrent [[Antrochoanal polyp]].
    *   Biopsy of suspected [[Maxillary sinus]] malignancy.
4.  **Trauma:**
    *   Management of complex midfacial fractures (Maxillary fractures).
    *   Repair of orbital floor fractures (blow-out fractures).
5.  **Access for Other Procedures:**
    *   **Oroantral Fistula:** To close the fistula and clear the sinus.
    *   **Pterygopalatine Fossa Surgery:** To perform [[Vidian neurectomy]] or ligation of the [[Maxillary artery]] for intractable [[Epistaxis]].
    *   **Orbital Decompression:** Transantral ethmoidectomy (Horgan’s operation).

### Contraindications
*   **Age:** Generally contraindicated in children (< 17 years) before the eruption of permanent teeth (secondary dentition) to avoid damage to tooth buds,.
*   **Acute Infection:** Acute [[Maxillary sinusitis]].

### Surgical Technique

**Anesthesia:**
*   **Local Anesthesia:** Infiltration of the gingivobuccal sulcus (canine fossa) and nerve blocks (Posterior superior alveolar and Infraorbital nerves).
*   **General Anesthesia:** Preferred for children or anxious patients,.

**Position:**
*   Supine with the head end elevated.

**Steps of Operation:**
1.  **Incision:** A sublabial horizontal incision is made in the gingivobuccal sulcus, extending from the lateral incisor to the second molar, well above the tooth roots,.
2.  **Flap Elevation:** The mucoperiosteal flap is elevated superiorly to expose the canine fossa, taking care to identify and protect the [[Infraorbital nerve]],.
3.  **Canine Fossa Antrostomy:** The anterior wall of the antrum is opened using a gouge, burr, or osteotome. The opening is enlarged with [[Kerrison’s punch]] or [[Citelli’s punch]] to provide a view of the sinus interior,.
4.  **Disease Removal:** Diseased mucosa, polyps, cysts, or foreign bodies are removed using elevators and [[Luc's forceps]]. Reversible mucosa should be preserved,.
5.  **Inferior Meatal Antrostomy:** A separate nasoantral window is created in the [[Inferior meatus]] to ensure gravity-dependent drainage,.
6.  **Closure:** The sublabial incision is sutured with absorbable material (e.g., chromic catgut).

### Complications
Complications are divided into immediate and delayed,:

| Category | Complication | Mechanism/Cause |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Facial/Dental** | **Facial Swelling** | Soft tissue reaction to retraction (Most common) |
| | **Parethesia/Anesthesia** | Injury to the [[Infraorbital nerve]] causing numbness of cheek, nose, and upper lip. |
| | **Dental Injury** | Damage to tooth roots or superior alveolar nerves causing devitalized teeth or numbness. |
| **Ophthalmic** | **Orbital Injury** | Breach of the orbital floor. |
| | **Nasolacrimal Duct Injury** | Damage during the creation of the antrostomy. |
| **Surgical Site** | **Oroantral Fistula** | Breakdown of the sublabial incision. |
| | **Hemorrhage** | Bleeding from the mucosal edges or bony walls. |
| **Infection** | **Osteomyelitis** | Infection of the maxilla (Rare). |

# Antral Washout (Proof Puncture)

### Definition
**[[Antral Washout]]** (also known as **Proof Puncture** or **Antral Lavage**) is a procedure involving the puncture of the medial wall of the [[Maxillary sinus]] through the [[Inferior meatus]] to irrigate the sinus cavity,.

### Indications
1.  **Diagnostic:**
    *   To confirm diagnosis when X-rays/CT are inconclusive.
    *   To obtain specimens for cytology (malignancy exclusion) or culture sensitivity,.
2.  **Therapeutic:**
    *   Removal of pus in subacute or [[Chronic maxillary sinusitis]] not responding to medical therapy.
    *   To treat **[[Oroantral fistula]]** (clearing infection before repair),.

### Contraindications
*   **[[Acute Maxillary Sinusitis]]:** Risk of spreading infection and causing **[[Osteomyelitis]]** of the maxilla,.
*   **Bleeding Disorders:** Uncorrected coagulopathy.
*   **Young Children:** Due to the risk of damage to unerupted tooth buds and thick bony walls.

### Instruments Required
*   **[[Lichtwitz trocar and cannula]]**,.
*   **[[Higginson’s syringe]]** or a 20-50 mL syringe,.
*   Nasal speculum, anesthetic spray/pack.

### Technique
1.  **Anesthesia:** Local anesthesia using a pack soaked in 4% Lignocaine with adrenaline placed in the inferior meatus.
2.  **Position:** Sitting position (for LA) or Tonsillar position (for GA).
3.  **Puncture Site:** The [[Inferior meatus]], approximately **1.25 cm to 2.0 cm** behind the anterior end of the [[Inferior turbinate]]. This area is chosen because the bone is thinnest here (high up under the genu of the turbinate),,.
4.  **Direction:** The trocar is directed towards the **ipsilateral ear** (or outer canthus of the eye) to avoid the orbit or pterygopalatine fossa,.
5.  **Procedure:** The trocar pierces the bone with a controlled force. The trocar is withdrawn, leaving the cannula. Saline is irrigated through the cannula; the patient leans forward, and fluid exits through the natural ostium in the middle meatus.

### Diagnostic Interpretation
The nature of the return fluid indicates pathology,:
*   **Frank Pus:** Suppurative sinusitis.
*   **Mucopus blobs:** Hyperplastic sinusitis.
*   **Amber fluid (instant):** [[Antral cyst]].
*   **Foul-smelling pus:** Dental origin (anaerobes) or fungal infection.

### Complications
Although a minor procedure, serious complications can occur,,:

*   **Hemorrhage:** From the lateral wall of the nose.
*   **Cheek Swelling:** Due to false passage into the soft tissues anterior to the maxilla.
*   **Orbital Injury:** Perforation of the orbital floor causing orbital cellulitis or hematoma.
*   **[[Air Embolism]]:** **Fatal complication** caused by insufflating air into the sinus after lavage; air enters injured mucosal veins. **Never inject air**.
*   **Vasovagal Attack:** Syncope due to pain or anxiety.
*   **Pterygopalatine Fossa Injury:** Puncture of the posterior wall can damage the maxillary artery or sphenopalatine ganglion.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Current Status:** Antral washout and Caldwell-Luc are performed much less frequently today. **[[FESS]]** is now the standard of care for chronic sinusitis and sinus pathology due to its minimally invasive nature and ability to restore physiological drainage,.
*   **Mnemonic for Complications of Antral Wash:** **"SHOCK"**
    *   **S**welling (Cheek/Orbit)
    *   **H**emorrhage
    *   **O**rbital injury
    *   **C**ardiac/Vasovagal attack
    *   **K**ills (Air Embolism)
