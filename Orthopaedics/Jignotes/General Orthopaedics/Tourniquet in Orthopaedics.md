# [[General Orthopaedics]] > Tourniquet in Orthopaedics

### Tourniquet in Orthopaedics

The [[tourniquet]] is a fundamental instrument in orthopaedic surgery used to create a **bloodless field**. This allows the surgeon to operate with greater speed, accuracy, and safety by improving visibility of anatomical structures.

#### **Principles of Use**

*   **Type:** Only a **[[pneumatic tourniquet]]** (inflatable cuff) should be used. Rubber bandages (like the Esmarch bandage used alone as a tourniquet) are potentially dangerous because the pressure cannot be controlled or measured accurately.
*   **Protection:** The skin beneath the cuff must be protected. A layer of [[wool bandage]] or soft padding must be applied under the cuff to distribute pressure evenly and prevent wrinkling or blistering of the underlying skin.
*   **Site:** Applied to the proximal part of the limb (upper arm or thigh) where there is sufficient muscle bulk to protect nerves.

#### **Exsanguination (Draining the Blood)**

Before inflating the cuff, the limb must be emptied of venous blood to ensure a dry field.

1.  **Elevation:** Elevating the limb to 60 degrees above horizontal for 30 seconds is often sufficient for gravity drainage.
2.  **Mechanical Exsanguination:** For a completely bloodless field, an [[Esmarch rubber bandage]] is wrapped firmly from distal to proximal. A **[[Rhys Davies exsanguinator]]** is an equally effective alternative.

**Clinical Implication:** **Do NOT** use mechanical exsanguination (Esmarch bandage) in cases of **[[infection]]** or **[[malignancy]]** (tumors). Squeezing the limb may spread bacteria or tumor cells proximally. In these cases, rely only on elevation.

#### **Tourniquet Pressure and Time Limits**

Correct pressure settings are vital to prevent neurovascular damage. The pressure is determined relative to the patient's systolic blood pressure (BP).

| Limb | Recommended Pressure Setting |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Upper Limb** | Systolic BP + 100 mmHg |
| **Lower Limb** | Systolic BP + 150 mmHg |

**Safe Duration:**
*   **Maximum Time:** The tourniquet time should generally **not exceed 2 hours**.
*   **Reperfusion:** If surgery takes longer, the tourniquet must be deflated for a period (usually 10-15 minutes) to allow tissue reperfusion before re-inflating.

#### **Indications**

1.  ** delicate soft tissue surgeries:** [[Hand surgery]], tendon repairs, and nerve repairs where microsurgical precision is required.
2.  **[[Arthroscopy]]**: Particularly knee arthroscopy to visualize intra-articular structures.
3.  **Fracture fixation:** Internal fixation of fractures to visualize fracture lines and articular surfaces.
4.  **[[Amputations]]**: To minimize blood loss (unless the amputation is for arterial insufficiency).
5.  **Bone grafting procedures.**

#### **Contraindications**

*   **[[Peripheral vascular disease]] (PVD):** Compression may cause thrombosis or further ischemic damage to already compromised vessels.
*   **Severe Crush Injuries:** If muscle viability is in doubt, a tourniquet should be avoided to allow assessment of muscle bleeding (contractility and bleeding are signs of viability).
*   **Sickle Cell Disease:** High risk of sickling and thrombosis due to stasis and hypoxia.

#### **Complications**

Improper use leads to significant morbidity.

*   **[[Tourniquet Palsy]]**: A form of **[[neurapraxia]]** caused by direct pressure or ischemia. The **[[radial nerve]]** is particularly susceptible in the arm. This is often "Doctor's mistake" due to excessive pressure or time.
*   **Muscle Damage:** Prolonged ischemia leads to muscle necrosis. In severe cases, massive release of myoglobin upon deflation can cause **[[Crush Syndrome]]** and renal failure.
*   **[[Compartment Syndrome]]**: Post-ischemic swelling after deflation can increase intracompartmental pressure.
*   **Post-operative Haematoma:** If the tourniquet is not released before wound closure, unligated vessels may bleed into the closed wound.
*   **Chemical Burns:** If skin preparation solutions (like iodine) soak into the padding under the cuff, they can cause severe chemical burns under pressure.

**Clinical Implication:** Whenever practicable, the tourniquet should be released **before** wound closure. This allows the surgeon to identify and cauterize/ligate bleeding vessels, preventing a "silent" postoperative [[haematoma]].

#### **Surgical Safety Checklist (WHO)**

Use of the tourniquet is a critical check-point in the **[[WHO Surgical Safety Checklist]]**. To save tourniquet time, the limb should be shaved, prepared, draped, and marked *before* inflating the cuff.
