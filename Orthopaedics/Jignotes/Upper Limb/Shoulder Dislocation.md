# [[Upper Limb]] > Shoulder Dislocation

### [[Shoulder Dislocation]] (Glenohumeral Joint Dislocation)

The [[glenohumeral joint]] is the most mobile joint in the body, but this comes at a price: it is also the most frequently dislocated joint (approx. 50% of all dislocations). The large humeral head articulates with a small, shallow [[glenoid fossa]] (like a golf ball on a tee), making it inherently unstable.

#### Classification of Shoulder Dislocation

| Type | Frequency | Position of Humeral Head | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Anterior Dislocation]]** | **Most Common (95-98%)** | Anterior to glenoid, usually Subcoracoid | Abduction, Extension & External Rotation (e.g., Fall on outstretched hand) |
| **[[Posterior Dislocation]]** | Rare (< 5%) | Posterior to glenoid | Adduction, Flexion & Internal Rotation (e.g., Seizures, Electric Shock) |
| **[[Inferior Dislocation]]** | Very Rare (< 1%) | Below glenoid (Luxatio Erecta) | Hyperabduction force |
| **Superior Dislocation** | Extremely Rare | Above glenoid | Extreme upward force |

### 1. [[Anterior Dislocation of Shoulder]]

This is the most common variety. The humeral head is forced out of the glenoid capsule anteriorly, usually ending up in a **subcoracoid** position.

#### Clinical Features
**Symptoms:**
*   Severe pain.
*   Patient supports the injured arm with the opposite hand.
*   Inability to move the shoulder.

**Signs (Look, Feel, Move):**
*   **Attitude of Limb:** The arm is held in **Abduction** and **External Rotation**.
*   **Loss of Contour:** The normal round contour of the shoulder is lost (flattened deltoid). The acromion appears prominent (squared-off shoulder).
*   **Fullness:** Palpable fullness below the clavicle (the displaced head).
*   **Duga’s Test:** The patient cannot touch the opposite shoulder with the hand of the affected side.
*   **Hamilton’s Ruler Test:** A ruler placed on the lateral side of the arm can touch the [[acromion process]] and the [[lateral epicondyle]] simultaneously (normally the deltoid bulge prevents this).
*   **Callaway’s Test:** The vertical circumference of the axilla is increased compared to the normal side.

**Clinical Implication:** Always check for **[[Axillary Nerve]] Injury** before and after reduction. This is tested by checking sensation over the "Regimental Badge" area (lateral aspect of the proximal arm) and contraction of the [[deltoid muscle]].

#### Radiology (X-Ray)
*   **Anteroposterior (AP) View:** Shows the humeral head out of the glenoid fossa (usually inferomedial).
*   **Axillary View / Y-View:** Confirms the anterior position.

#### Pathology of Injury
1.  **[[Bankart Lesion]]:** Avulsion of the anteroinferior [[glenoid labrum]] and capsule from the glenoid rim. This is the essential lesion responsible for recurrent dislocations.
2.  **[[Hill-Sachs Lesion]]:** A compression fracture/dent on the posterolateral aspect of the [[humeral head]] caused by impaction against the anterior glenoid rim.

#### Treatment: Reduction Maneuvers
Reduction is an emergency due to muscle spasm and pain. It is best performed under sedation or general anesthesia.

**A. Kocher’s Method**
The most classic method. Remember the mnemonic **TEAM**.
1.  **T** - **Traction:** Steady traction in the line of the humerus.
2.  **E** - **External Rotation:** The arm is externally rotated (overcomes spasm of subscapularis).
3.  **A** - **Adduction:** The arm is adducted across the chest.
4.  **M** - **Medial (Internal) Rotation:** The arm is internally rotated so the hand touches the opposite shoulder.

**B. Stimson’s Gravity Method**
*   Patient lies prone with the arm hanging down the side of the table. Weights are tied to the wrist. Gravity assists reduction over 15–20 minutes.

**C. Hippocratic Method**
*   (Historical/Emergency) Traction applied to the arm while the surgeon places a foot (without shoe) in the axilla to act as a fulcrum. *Caution: Risk of nerve injury.*

**Post-Reduction Care:**
*   Immobilization in a sling/chest-arm bandage for **3 weeks** to allow soft tissue healing.
*   Isometric exercises started early; abduction/external rotation avoided for 6 weeks.

### 2. [[Posterior Dislocation of Shoulder]]

Often missed or misdiagnosed as "Frozen Shoulder" because the deformity is less obvious.

#### Mechanism of Injury
*   **The 3 E's:**
    1.  **E**lectric Shock.
    2.  **E**pilepsy (Seizures).
    3.  **E**thanol (Trauma/Alcohol).
*   Violent muscle contraction of internal rotators (Latissimus dorsi, Subscapularis, Pectoralis major) overpowers the external rotators.

#### Clinical Features
*   **Attitude:** The arm is held in **Adduction** and **Internal Rotation**.
*   **fixed Internal Rotation:** The patient cannot externally rotate the arm.
*   Shoulder contour may appear normal in the front, but the coracoid process may be less prominent, and the humeral head may be palpable posteriorly.

#### Radiology
*   **Light Bulb Sign:** On the AP view, the humeral head looks like a light bulb (circular) because it is locked in internal rotation (the normal anatomical neck profile is lost).
*   **Empty Glenoid Sign:** Increased space between the anterior glenoid rim and the humeral head.

#### Treatment
*   Reduction by traction and gentle external rotation.
*   Immobilization in **external rotation** (using a brace/splint).

### 3. [[Inferior Dislocation]] (Luxatio Erecta)

*   **Presentation:** The patient presents with the arm locked in **hyperabduction** (hand raised above the head, often resting on the head).
*   **Pathology:** The humeral head is forced below the glenoid.
*   **Complication:** Highest risk of neurovascular injury (axillary artery/brachial plexus).
*   **Treatment:** Traction in the line of abduction, then gently swinging the arm down to the side.

### Complications of Shoulder Dislocation

1.  **Recurrent Dislocation:** The most common late complication, especially in young adults (<20 years).
2.  **Nerve Injury:**
    *   **[[Axillary Nerve]] (Circumflex nerve):** Most common. Causes deltoid paralysis and sensory loss over the "regimental badge" area. usually neuropraxia (recovers).
    *   Musculocutaneous nerve.
3.  **Vascular Injury:** [[Axillary artery]] damage (older patients with arteriosclerosis).
4.  **Associated Fractures:**
    *   Fracture of the **[[Greater Tuberosity]]** (common in anterior dislocation).
    *   Fracture of the **Surgical Neck of Humerus**.
5.  **Joint Stiffness:** Especially in elderly patients ("Frozen shoulder").

### [[Recurrent Anterior Dislocation]]

If the initial Bankart lesion does not heal, the shoulder becomes unstable.

**Clinical Assessment:**
*   **Apprehension Test:** Abduct and externally rotate the patient's arm. The patient resists and looks apprehensive, fearing dislocation.
*   **Relocation Test:** Applying a posterior force on the humeral head during the apprehension test relieves the fear.

**Surgical Management:**
*   **Arthroscopic [[Bankart Repair]]:** Reattaching the torn labrum to the glenoid using suture anchors (Gold Standard).
*   **Putti-Platt Operation:** (Historical) Double-breasting (shortening) the subscapularis tendon to limit external rotation.
*   **Bristow-Latarjet Procedure:** Transfer of the [[coracoid process]] (with conjoined tendon) to the anterior glenoid rim. Used for cases with significant glenoid bone loss.
