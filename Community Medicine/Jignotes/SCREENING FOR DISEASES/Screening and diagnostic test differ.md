# [[SCREENING FOR DISEASES]] > Screening and diagnostic test differ

### **Differences Between Screening and Diagnostic Tests**

While both [[Screening]] and [[Diagnostic Tests]] involve examining individuals for disease, they are fundamentally different in their intent, target population, and application. Screening is a preventive care function, whereas diagnosis is a curative care function,.

A screening test is **not** intended to be a diagnostic test. It is only an initial examination. Those found positive are referred to a physician for a final diagnosis and treatment.

#### **Comparison Table: Screening vs. Diagnostic Tests**

| Feature | Screening Test | Diagnostic Test |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Target Population** | Done on apparently **healthy** individuals,. | Done on those who are **sick** or have symptoms,. |
| **Application** | Applied to **groups** or populations,. | Applied to **single individuals** (patients),. |
| **Test Results** | Results are **arbitrary** and final (based on a cut-off),. | Diagnosis is **not final**; it is modified in light of new evidence,. |
| **Basis of Result** | Based on **one criterion** or cut-off point,. | Based on evaluation of a number of signs, symptoms, and lab findings,. |
| **Cost** | Relatively **less expensive** (cheaper),. | **More expensive**,. |
| **Time Required** | Relatively **rapid**,. | **Time-consuming**,. |
| **Accuracy** | Relatively **inaccurate** (less sensitive/specific),. | **More accurate**,. |
| **Basis for Treatment** | **Cannot** be used as a basis for treatment,. | Used as a **useful basis** for treatment,. |
| **Initiative** | Initiative comes from the **investigator** or agency,. | Initiative comes from the **patient** with a complaint,. |

### **Clinical Relevance: The Iceberg Phenomenon**

Understanding the difference is crucial for grasping the **[[Iceberg Phenomenon of Disease]]**:
*   **Clinicians/Diagnostic Tests** are concerned with the **"Tip of the Iceberg"** (the symptomatic, diagnosed cases).
*   **Epidemiologists/Screening** are concerned with the **"Submerged Portion"** (the hidden mass of disease, presymptomatic cases, and carriers),.

### **Concept of "Lead Time"**
The advantage gained by screening is called **[[Lead Time]]**. This is the period between the diagnosis by early detection (Screening) and the diagnosis by other means (usual clinical diagnosis),. The goal is to detect the disease *before* the **Final Critical Point**, after which treatment may be less effective,.

### **Mnemonic**

To remember the characteristics of a **SCREENING** test, think of **"PACT"**:

*   **P** - **P**opulation (Applied to healthy groups/masses)
*   **A** - **A**rbitrary results (Pass/Fail cut-offs)
*   **C** - **C**heap & Rapid
*   **T** - **T**reatment (NOT a basis for treatment)
