Requires special media like BCG agar (blood cysteine glucose agar). | Antibody detection is mainstay of diagnosis (agglutination tests, ELISA). Species identification by biochemical tests. | Automated systems like VITEK. PCR assay for specific genes. | **Gentamicin** is drug of choice. Alternatives: Doxycycline or ciprofloxacin. | - |
| Dog Bite Infections | Mixed aerobes and anaerobes. **Aerobes**: *Pasteurella* spp., *Staphylococcus*, β-hemolytic streptococci, *Eikenella corrodens*, *Capnocytophaga canimorsus*. **Anaerobes**: *Actinomyces*, *Fusobacterium*, *Prevotella*. Also Rabies virus, tetanus. | - | - | - | Inoculation of microorganisms from dog's oral cavity into wound. Can breach skin barrier, lead to local or systemic infection. | - | Wound infection (15-20% of bites). Can cause osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, bacteremia, meningitis. *P. multocida* causes red, swollen, painful area with lymphadenopathy. *C. canimorsus* can cause fulminant septicemia in asplenic patients. | Purulent exudate aspirated from depth of wound, or surgical samples. Wound swab is common but less ideal. | Gram-stained smears. | Aerobic culture on blood, MacConkey, chocolate agar. Anaerobic culture is necessary. | Biochemical identification or automated methods (MALDI-TOF, VITEK). | - | Penicillin G or amoxicillin-clavulanate for *Pasteurella*. Ampicillin-sulbactam for *Capnocytophaga*. Tetanus and rabies prophylaxis as needed. | - |
| Cat Bite Infections | Mixed flora similar to dog bites. Main pathogens: ***Pasteurella multocida***, ***Bartonella henselae*** (cat-scratch disease), *Francisella tularensis*, *S. aureus*, anaerobes. Also rabies, tetanus. | - | - | - | Inoculation of microorganisms from cat's oropharynx. Higher risk of infection (>50%) and deep penetrating injury (septic arthritis, osteomyelitis) than dog bites due to sharp teeth. | - | Wound infection. Often presents as cellulitis. Can lead to septic arthritis, osteomyelitis. Cat-scratch disease presents with lymphadenopathy. | Purulent exudate aspirated from depth of wound, or surgical samples. | Gram-stained smears. | Aerobic and anaerobic cultures. | - | - | Amoxicillin-clavulanate is drug of choice. Rabies and tetanus prophylaxis. | - |
| Human Bite Infections | Diverse oral microbial flora. **Aerobes**: viridans streptococci, *S. aureus*, *Eikenella corrodens*, *Haemophilus influenzae*. **Anaerobes**: *Fusobacterium nucleatum*, *Prevotella*, *Porphyromonas*. | - | - | - | Occur during fights, domestic abuse. Less frequent infection (10-15%) than animal bites. | - | Two types: **Occlusional injuries** (actual biting). **Clenched-fist injuries** (fist strikes teeth), more common and cause deeper infections of hand (bones, joints, tendons). | Purulent exudate aspirated from depth of wound. | Gram-stained smears. | Aerobic and anaerobic cultures. | - | - | - | - |
| Rat-Bite Fever (RBF) | *Streptobacillus moniliformis* (causes RBF in North America). *Spirillum minus* (causes Sodoku in Asia). | *S. moniliformis*: gram-negative, highly pleomorphic, nonmotile bacilli in chains/filaments; forms L-forms. *S. minus*: rigid, spirally coiled, motile bacilli. | - | - | Transmitted by contact with rodents, or consumption of contaminated food/water (**Haverhill fever**). | - | Septic fever, petechial rashes, and painful polyarthritis with frequent relapses. | Blood, synovial fluid. | - | *S. moniliformis* can be isolated. *S. minus* does not grow in artificial media. | - | - | **Penicillin** is the treatment of choice. | - |
