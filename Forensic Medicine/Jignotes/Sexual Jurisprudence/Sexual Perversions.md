# [[Sexual Jurisprudence]] > Sexual Perversions

### **Sexual Perversions (Paraphilias)**

[[Sexual Perversions]], also known as **Paraphilias** or **Sexual Deviations**, are conditions where sexual gratification is obtained without sexual intercourse, or through unusual objects, bizarre acts, or specific body parts. These acts may replace normal sexual activity partially or completely.

The following are the specific perversions requested:

---

### **1. Voyeurism (Scoptophilia)**
Also known as **"Peeping Tom"**.

*   **Definition:** It is a condition where sexual gratification is obtained by **secretly watching** others, usually when the victim is undressing, naked, or engaging in sexual acts.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   The offender is typically a male.
    *   The act is usually done without the knowledge of the victim.
    *   The perpetrator often masturbates while watching.
    *   In extreme forms, it is called **Ecouteurism** (listening to sounds of sexual intercourse).
*   **Medicolegal Aspects:**
    *   It is a punishable offence.
    *   **IPC Section 354C**: Defines and punishes voyeurism (watching or capturing the image of a woman engaging in a private act).
    *   **BNS Section 77**: Under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, voyeurism is punishable.

### **2. Exhibitionism**
Also known as **"Flashing"**.

*   **Definition:** A recurrent, intense sexual urge to **expose one's genitals** to an unsuspecting stranger (usually a female) to derive sexual gratification.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   The offender usually does not attempt further sexual contact; the shock, fear, or disgust shown by the victim provides the arousal.
    *   **Erectile Dysfunction:** The exhibitionist is often impotent or sexually inadequate in normal relationships.
*   **Variants:**
    *   **Streaking:** Running publicly in the nude.
    *   **Mooning:** Exposing the gluteal region (buttocks).
    *   **Flashing:** Suddenly undressing and exposing private parts.
*   **Medicolegal Aspects:**
    *   Punishable as **Public Nuisance** (Section 294 IPC) or specific sexual harassment laws.
    *   **BNS Section 79**: Covers the offense of word, gesture, or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman (relevant to exhibitionism).

### **3. Fetishism**
*   **Definition:** Sexual gratification is obtained through **inanimate objects** or specific body parts (excluding genitals) that are not normally considered sexual.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **The Fetish:** The object causing arousal is called a fetish. Common items include shoes, undergarments, handkerchiefs, hair, or feet.
    *   The person may touch, smell, fondle, or wear the object during masturbation.
    *   **Hair Fetishism:** Involves cutting hair from unsuspecting women (assault) or stealing wigs.
*   **Medicolegal Aspects:**
    *   Often associated with crimes like **Theft** (stealing undergarments/shoes).
