# [[Health Care Of The Community]] > Primary Health Care

### Primary Health Care (PHC)

**Primary Health Care** is a new approach to health care that came into existence following the international conference at [[Alma-Ata Declaration]] in 1978. It is accepted as the key to attaining the goal of **"Health for All"**.

#### Definition
Primary Health Care is defined as:
> "Essential health care made universally accessible to individuals and acceptable to them, through their full participation and at a cost the community and country can afford",.

It forms an integral part of the country’s health system and is the **first level of contact** of individuals, the family, and the community with the national health system,.

2.  **A**ffordability
3.  **A**ccessibility
4.  **A**cceptability

#### Elements of Primary Health Care
The Alma-Ata Declaration outlined **8 essential components** of PHC. These are the minimum requirements, though countries can add more based on local needs (e.g., mental health, care of the elderly),.

**Mnemonic: ELEMENTS**,

| Letter | Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **E** | **E**ducation | Concerning prevailing health problems and methods of preventing/controlling them. |
| **L** | **L**ocally endemic diseases | Prevention and control of diseases specific to the region (e.g., Malaria, Goiter). |
| **E** | **E**ssential drugs | Provision of essential medicines. |
| **M** | **M**aternal & Child Health | Health care for mothers and children, including [[Family Planning]]. |
| **E** | **E**PI (Immunization) | Immunization against major infectious diseases. |
| **N** | **N**utrition | Promotion of food supply and proper nutrition. |

#### Principles of Primary Health Care
These are the **four pillars** upon which the strategy of PHC is built.

**1. Equitable Distribution**
*   Health services must be shared equally by all people irrespective of their ability to pay.
*   It aims to redress the imbalance between urban and rural health care.
*   **Concept:** Shifts the center of gravity of the health system from cities to rural areas and urban slums to reach the "social periphery".
*   **Clinical Relevance:** Prioritizing the vulnerable and needy groups (social justice).

**2. Community Participation**
*   Involvement of individuals, families, and communities in promoting their own health and welfare.
*   Moving away from "health care **for** the people" to "health care **by** the people".
*   Communities participate in planning, implementation, and maintenance of health services.
*   **Example:** Use of [[Village Health Guides]] and [[ASHA]] workers creates self-reliance.

**3. Intersectoral Coordination**
*   Health cannot be provided by the health sector alone. It requires the coordination of related sectors.
*   **Key Sectors:** Agriculture (food), Education (literacy), Public Works (housing/sanitation), and Communication.
*   **Goal:** To avoid duplication of activities and ensure comprehensive development.

**4. Appropriate Technology**
*   Technology that is scientifically sound, adaptable to local needs, and acceptable to those who apply it and those for whom it is used,.
*   It implies using methods that are affordable and manageable by the local community.
*   **Examples:** Use of the [[Vaccine Vial Monitor]], Stand-alone BP instruments, and [[Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS)]].

#### Difference Between Medical Care and Health Care
*   **Medical Care:** Refers chiefly to personal services (diagnosis, treatment) provided by physicians.
*   **Health Care:** A broader concept including medical care plus preventive services, health promotion, and social aspects of health. PHC is a holistic approach.
