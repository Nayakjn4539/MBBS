### Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART)

**Definition**
Techniques used to achieve pregnancy by artificial or partially artificial means, primarily involving the handling of eggs, sperm, or embryos outside the human body. These are used when natural conception is not possible due to infertility or genetic risks.

### Classification of ART

#### 1. [[Artificial Insemination]] (AI)
The deposition of semen into the female genital tract (vagina, cervix, or uterus) by instruments to achieve pregnancy.

**Types:**
*   **AIH ([[Artificial Insemination Homologous]]):** Using the husband's semen.
    *   *Indications:* Husband is impotent but fertile, anatomical defects (e.g., hypospadias), retrograde ejaculation, or oligospermia.
*   **AID ([[Artificial Insemination Donor]]):** Using a donor's semen.
    *   *Indications:* Husband is sterile (azoospermia), Rh incompatibility (severe isoimmunization), or husband carries a hereditary disease (e.g., Huntington's chorea).
*   **AIHD (Artificial Insemination Homologous Donor):** Using "pooled semen" (Husband + Donor). This is rarely done now but was historically used to obscure the biological father's identity psychologically.

**Guidelines for Donor Selection:**
*   Age should be below 40 years.
*   Must be free from STDs (HIV, Hepatitis B/C, Syphilis) and genetic disorders.
*   Identity must remain anonymous to the recipient (and vice versa).
*   Physical characteristics (race, complexion, eye color) should match the husband as closely as possible.
*   The donor should not be a relative of the couple.

#### 2. [[In Vitro Fertilization]] (IVF) / Test Tube Babies
The ovum is fertilized by sperm outside the body (in a laboratory dish) and the resulting embryo is transferred to the uterus.

**Variations:**
*   **GIFT (Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer):** Sperm and ova are mixed and immediately placed into the fallopian tube. Fertilization occurs inside the body.
*   **ZIFT (Zygote Intrafallopian Transfer):** Fertilized zygote is placed into the fallopian tube.
*   **ICSI ([[Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection]]):** A single sperm is injected directly into an egg; used for severe male factor infertility.
*   **[[Oocyte Donation]]:** Uses eggs from a donor fertilized by the husband's sperm.

#### 3. [[Surrogate Motherhood]]
A woman (surrogate) agrees to carry a pregnancy for another couple (commissioning parents) and hand over the child after birth.

*   **Traditional Surrogacy:** Surrogate provides her own egg (genetically related to the child) + Commissioning father's sperm.
*   **Gestational Surrogacy:** Surrogate carries an embryo created via IVF using the commissioning couple's egg and sperm (genetically unrelated to the child).
*   **ICMR Guidelines:**
    *   Surrogacy should be considered only when medically impossible for parents to carry a baby.
    *   A contract must be documented covering all expenses.
    *   The genetic parents must adopt the child born through surrogacy to establish legal rights.

### Medicolegal Aspects of ART

**1. Legitimacy of the Child**
*   **AIH/IVF (Husband's sperm):** The child is **legitimate**.
*   **AID (Donor sperm):**
    *   Ideally, the child is illegitimate because the husband is not the biological father.
    *   However, if **written informed consent** was obtained from both husband and wife, the child is considered legitimate in the eyes of the law in many jurisdictions (estoppel).
    *   In cases of surrogacy, the birth certificate guidelines vary; usually, genetic parents are listed, or adoption is required.

**2. Adultery**
*   [[Adultery]] is defined as voluntary sexual intercourse between a married person and someone other than their spouse.
*   **ART/AID is NOT adultery** because there is no physical union or penetration involved.

**3. Impotence and Nullity of Marriage**
*   Impotence is the inability to perform sexual intercourse.
*   If a wife conceives via AIH (using husband's sperm), the marriage can **still be declared null and void** on the grounds of impotence if the husband cannot consummate the marriage naturally. The birth of a child does not prove potency or consummation.

**4. Divorce**
*   If a woman undergoes AID **without the husband's consent**, it can be cited as a ground for divorce (mental cruelty).

**5. Inheritance**
*   A child born of AID has no legal right to the property of the husband unless legally adopted.
*   The child has no claim over the donor's property, and the donor has no parental rights or obligations.

**6. Liability/Negligence**
*   Doctors can be sued for negligence if:
    *   They fail to screen the donor for genetic diseases or STDs.
    *   They fail to obtain proper **informed written consent** from *both* spouses.
    *   The donor's race/blood group is grossly mismatched (breach of contract).

### Mnemonics

**Indications for AID (Donor Sperm):**
**"RASH"**
*   **R** - **R**h Incompatibility
*   **A** - **A**zoospermia (Sterility)
*   **S** - **S**evere Oligospermia
*   **H** - **H**ereditary disease in husband

**Types of ART:**
**"GIZMO"**
*   **G** - **G**IFT
*   **I** - **I**VF / **I**CSI
*   **Z** - **Z**IFT
*   **M** - **M**otherhood (Surrogacy)
*   **O** - **O**ocyte donation

### Precautions for Medical Practitioners

1.  **Written Consent:** Mandatory from both husband and wife. The consent form should state they accept the child as their own.
2.  **Confidentiality:** The identity of the donor must not be revealed to the couple, and the couple's identity must not be revealed to the donor.
3.  **Delivery:** The doctor performing the artificial insemination should ideally **avoid delivering the child** to prevent ethical conflicts regarding signing the birth certificate (falsifying the father's name).
4.  **Screening:** Rigorous screening of donors for HIV, Hepatitis B/C, and genetic history.
