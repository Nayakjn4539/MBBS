# [[Firearms And Ballistics]] > Cartridges

### **Cartridge (Ammunition)**

A **cartridge** is a complete unit of ammunition found in modern firearms. It consists of a single unit containing the case, primer, propellant (gunpowder), and projectile(s).

### **General Components of a Cartridge**

A typical cartridge consists of four (or five in shotguns) main components:

1.  **Cartridge Case (Shell)**
2.  **Primer (Percussion Cap)**
3.  **Propellant (Gunpowder)**
4.  **Projectile (Bullet or Pellets)**
5.  **Wad** (Specific to Shotguns)

#### **1. Cartridge Case**
*   **Material:** Usually made of brass (copper + zinc) for rifled firearms; paper or plastic tube with a brass base for [[shotguns]].
*   **Function:**
    *   It holds all components together.
    *   **Obturation:** It expands upon firing to seal the breech against the escape of high-pressure gases backward.
    *   **Identification:** The base (head) usually carries the manufacturer's stamp and caliber details.
*   **Types based on Base:**
    *   **Rimmed:** Has a flange at the base (e.g., Shotguns, Revolvers).
    *   **Rimless:** Has an extraction groove; used in automatic/semi-automatic weapons (Pistols, Rifles).
    *   **Semi-rimmed** and **Belted**.

#### **2. Primer (Percussion Cap)**
*   **Location:** Situated at the center of the base (Center-fire) or inside the rim (Rim-fire).
*   **Function:** It contains a highly sensitive explosive mixture that ignites when struck by the **firing pin**. It acts as the "spark" to ignite the main gunpowder.
*   **Composition:** Crucial for detecting [[Gunshot Residue]] (GSR).
    *   **Lead Styphnate** (Initiator)
    *   **Barium Nitrate** (Oxidizer)
    *   **Antimony Sulphide** (Fuel)
    *   *Old composition:* Mercury fulminate (now obsolete as it corrodes the barrel).

> **Mnemonic for Primer Composition:**
> **"L A B"** results for GSR
> *   **L** - Lead peroxide/styphnate
> *   **A** - Antimony sulphide
> *   **B** - Barium nitrate

#### **3. Propellant (Gunpowder)**
*   **Black Powder:**
    *   Oldest form. Mixture of **Potassium Nitrate (75%)**, **Charcoal (15%)**, and **Sulfur (10%)**.
    *   Produces thick white smoke (fouling) on firing.
*   **Smokeless Powder:**
    *   Modern standard. Burns cleanly with minimal smoke.
    *   **Single Base:** Nitrocellulose.
    *   **Double Base:** Nitrocellulose + Nitroglycerine.
    *   **Triple Base:** Nitrocellulose + Nitroglycerine + Nitroguanidine.

#### **4. Projectile**
*   **Rifled Firearms:** Single **Bullet** (Lead, Jacketed, or Semi-jacketed). It may have a **cannelure** (groove) for crimping the case.
*   **Shotguns:** Multiple **Lead Shots** (Pellets) or a single **Slug**.
    *   **Buckshot:** Large pellets.
    *   **Birdshot:** Small pellets.

#### **5. Wad (Shotgun Specific)**
*   **Material:** Felt, cardboard, or plastic cups.
*   **Functions:**
    *   **Separation:** Prevents mixing of powder and shot.
    *   **Gas Seal:** Prevents gas leakage (obturation) to ensure maximum force pushes the pellets.
    *   **Lubrication:** Cleans the barrel during exit.
*   **Medicolegal Importance:** It acts as a secondary missile at close range and can help determine the **range of fire** and the **gauge** of the weapon,.

### **Comparison: Shotgun vs. Rifled Cartridge**

| Feature | **Shotgun Cartridge** | **Rifled Firearm Cartridge** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Case Material** | Cardboard or Plastic with metal base | Usually Brass (Metal) |
| **Projectile** | Multiple lead pellets (Shots) or Slug | Single Bullet |
| **Wads** | **Present** (Essential component) | **Absent** (Usually) |
| **Shape** | Cylindrical, flat rimmed base | Cylindrical or Bottle-necked |
| **Effect** | Massive tissue destruction at close range | Penetrating/Perforating wounds |
| **Design** | **Turn-over** or **Crimp** closure at the top | Bullet crimped into the neck of the case |

### **Medicolegal Importance of Cartridges**

#### **1. Identification of the Weapon**
The fired [[cartridge case]] is often found at the scene of the crime (especially in automatic weapons) and provides distinct "ballistic fingerprints":
*   **Firing Pin Impression:** A dent on the primer cup; unique to the weapon.
*   **Breech Face Markings:** Marks impressed on the base of the cartridge by the backward thrust against the breech block.
*   **Extractor and Ejector Marks:** Scratches on the rim or groove caused by the mechanism ejecting the shell.
*   **Chamber Marks:** Irregularities inside the gun chamber imprinted on the expanding heated metal case.

#### **2. Determination of Range**
*   **Wads:** In shotgun injuries, if the wad is found inside the wound, it indicates a range of less than **2 meters**.
*   **Power Piston:** Plastic wads/cups may open up like petals and leave specific abrasion patterns (Maltese Cross abrasion) on the skin at specific ranges.

#### **3. Evidence Collection**
*   **Handling:** Pick up cartridges by the rim or inside the open mouth to avoid damaging fingerprints or breech marks.
*   **Marking:** Scratch identification initials on the **inside** of the open end or near the mouth, never on the base (head) where microscopic evidence resides.
*   **Preservation:** Wrap individually in cotton and pack in cardboard boxes.
