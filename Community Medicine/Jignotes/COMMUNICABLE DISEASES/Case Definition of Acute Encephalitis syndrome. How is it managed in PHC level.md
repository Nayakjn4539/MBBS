# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Case Definition of Acute Encephalitis syndrome. How is it managed in PHC level

### Case Definition of Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES)

In India, under the **[[National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme]] (NVBDCP)**, the syndromic approach is used for surveillance. The standard case definition used to identify a suspected case is:

**Suspect Case Definition:**
A person of **any age**, at **any time of the year** with:
1.  **Acute onset of fever** (not more than 5–7 days duration).
2.  **Change in mental status** (symptoms such as confusion, disorientation, coma, or inability to talk).
    *   **AND/OR**
3.  **New onset of seizures** (excluding simple febrile seizures).

**Other early clinical findings:**
*   Increase in irritability.
*   Somnolence.
*   Abnormal behavior greater than that seen with usual febrile illness,.

> **Clinical Relevance:**
> Differentiating AES from **[[Cerebral Malaria]]** is crucial.
> *   **AES:** Often presents with focal seizures or paralysis (asymmetrical signs).
> *   **Cerebral Malaria:** Typically presents with symmetrical signs and fever.
> *   **Note:** Presence of a **rash** usually excludes Japanese Encephalitis.

### Management at Primary Health Centre (PHC) Level

The primary goal at the PHC level is **early identification**, **stabilization**, and **prompt referral** to a First Referral Unit (FRU) or tertiary care center. Management is essentially symptomatic.

#### 1. General Principles of Care
*   **Nil Orally:** Do not give anything by mouth to an unconscious patient to prevent aspiration.
*   **Positioning:** Place the patient in a **prone** or **semi-prone position** with the head turned to one side. This prevents the tongue from falling back and obstructing the airway and helps drain secretions,.
*   **Airway Maintenance:** Keep the respiratory tract clear. Suction secretions from the throat/nose if necessary.
*   **Oxygen:** Administer oxygen if available and the patient is hypoxic or in respiratory distress.

#### 2. Symptomatic Management (The "First Line" Treatment)

| Symptom | Management Strategy at PHC |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fever** (>38.5°C) | • **Vigorous Tepid Sponging:** Use tap water (not ice water).<br>• **Antipyretics:** Paracetamol (if the patient can swallow or via suppository/injection if available),. |
| **Convulsions** | • Administer **[[Anti-convulsants]]** (e.g., Diazepam) immediately to control active seizures.<br>• If convulsions are not controlled, intramuscular referrals are needed. |
| **Dehydration** | • Start IV fluids (Normal Saline) if the patient is in shock or unable to drink, but **avoid fluid overload** as it can worsen cerebral edema,. |

#### 3. Referral (The Golden Rule)
Refer the patient **URGENTLY** to the nearest First Referral Unit (FRU) or District Hospital if any **Danger Signs** are present,.

**Danger Signs requiring immediate referral:**
*   Lethargy or Unconsciousness.
*   Convulsions (especially if uncontrolled).
*   Signs of raised intracranial pressure (e.g., pupil asymmetry).
*   Shock (hypotension, weak pulse).
*   Respiratory distress.

**Note on Transport:** Ensure the patient is kept warm and the airway is maintained during transport. Send a referral note with details of treatment given (e.g., dose of diazepam).

### Mnemonic for PHC Management: **"S.T.O.P."**

*   **S** - **S**uction secretions (Clear airway).
*   **T** - **T**emperature control (Tepid sponging/Paracetamol).
*   **O** - **O**xygen (if available) & **O**ffset seizures (Diazepam).
*   **P** - **P**osition (Lateral/Prone) & **P**rompt Referral.
