# Ocular Motility Examination

The examination of ocular motility is essential for diagnosing [[strabismus]] (squint), neuro-ophthalmic disorders, and orbital pathologies. It assesses the integrity of the [[extraocular muscles]] (EOM), their innervation, and the supranuclear control pathways.

## I. Anatomy and Physiology of Ocular Motility

### 1. Extraocular Muscles (EOM)
There are six EOMs governing the movement of each eye: four [[rectus muscles]] and two [[oblique muscles]].

*   **Origin:** All four recti arise from the [[Annulus of Zinn]] at the orbital apex. The [[Superior Oblique]] (SO) arises above the annulus, and the [[Inferior Oblique]] (IO) arises from the orbital floor (maxillary bone).
*   **Insertion:**
    *   Recti insert on the sclera anterior to the equator (Spiral of Tillaux). Distance from limbus: **M**edial (5.5mm), **I**nferior (6.5mm), **L**ateral (6.9mm), **S**uperior (7.7mm).
    *   Obliques insert posterior to the equator.

### 2. Muscle Actions
The action depends on the position of the globe.
*   **Primary Action:** The major effect in the primary position.
*   **Secondary/Tertiary Actions:** Additional effects due to the angle of the muscle insertion.

| Muscle | Nerve Supply | Primary Action | Secondary Action | Tertiary Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Medial Rectus (MR)** | [[CN III]] | Adduction | None | None |
| **Lateral Rectus (LR)** | [[CN VI]] | Abduction | None | None |
| **Superior Rectus (SR)** | [[CN III]] | Elevation | Intorsion | Adduction |
| **Inferior Rectus (IR)** | [[CN III]] | Depression | Extorsion | Adduction |
| **Superior Oblique (SO)** | [[CN IV]] | Intorsion | Depression | Abduction |
| **Inferior Oblique (IO)** | [[CN III]] | Extorsion | Elevation | Abduction |

**Mnemonics:**
*   **LR6SO4**: **L**ateral **R**ectus by **6**th nerve, **S**uperior **O**blique by **4**th nerve, rest by 3rd.
*   **SIN**: **S**uperiors **In**tort (SR and SO).
*   **RAD**: Vertical **R**ecti are **Ad**ductors.

### 3. Laws of Ocular Motility
*   **[[Hering’s Law of Equal Innervation]]:** Equal and simultaneous innervation flows to **yoke muscles** (contralateral synergists) for binocular conjugate movements. *Example: In dextroversion (looking right), the Right LR and Left MR receive equal innervation*.
*   **[[Sherrington’s Law of Reciprocal Innervation]]:** When an agonist muscle contracts, its direct antagonist in the same eye relaxes (receives inhibitory innervation). *Example: In abduction, LR contracts and MR relaxes*.

## II. Types of Eye Movements

### 1. Uniocular Movements ([[Ductions]])
Movements of a single eye:
*   **Adduction/Abduction:** Horizontal.
*   **Supraduction/Infraduction:** Vertical.
*   **Incycloduction/Excycloduction:** Torsional.

### 2. Binocular Movements
*   **[[Versions]] (Conjugate):** Both eyes move in the same direction (e.g., Dextroversion, Levoversion, Supraversion).
*   **[[Vergences]] (Disjugate):** Eyes move in opposite directions (e.g., [[Convergence]], [[Divergence]]).

### 3. Supranuclear Control
*   **[[Saccades]]:** Rapid fixation movements originating from the contralateral [[Frontal Eye Field]] (FEF).
*   **[[Smooth Pursuit]]:** Slow following movements originating from the ipsilateral occipital/parietal cortex.
*   **[[Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex]] (VOR):** Stabilizes gaze during head movement (Doll's eye reflex).

## III. Clinical Evaluation Steps

### 1. Inspection and Head Posture
Observe for **Abnormal Head Posture (AHP)**, which compensates for diplopia or limited field of vision.
*   **Face Turn:** Towards the field of action of the paretic muscle. *Example: Right [[CN VI palsy]] $\rightarrow$ Face turn to the Right*.
*   **Head Tilt:** To compensate for torsional diplopia. *Example: [[CN IV palsy]] $\rightarrow$ Head tilt to the **opposite** shoulder*.
*   **Chin Lift/Depression:** Compensates for vertical deviation ("A" or "V" patterns).

### 2. Assessment of Ocular Alignment
**A. [[Hirschberg’s Test]] (Corneal Light Reflex)**
*   Patient fixes on a torch light held 33cm away. Observe the position of the corneal reflection.
*   **Normal:** Reflex is central or slightly nasal.
*   **Deflection:**
    *   **Nasal:** [[Exotropia]].
    *   **Temporal:** [[Esotropia]].
*   **Estimation:** 1 mm deviation $\approx$ 7° or 15 Prism Diopters (PD).
    *   At pupil margin: ~15°.
    *   At limbus: ~45°.

**B. [[Krimsky’s Test]]**
*   Prisms are placed in front of the fixating eye until the corneal reflex in the deviating eye becomes central. This quantifies the deviation.

**C. Cover Tests**
*   **Cover Test:** Differentiates **Tropia** (Manifest squint). Cover the fixing eye; if the other eye moves to take up fixation, a manifest squint is present.
*   **Uncover Test:** Differentiates **Phoria** (Latent squint). Cover one eye (breaking fusion), then uncover it. If the eye deviates under cover and moves back upon uncovering, a phoria is present.
*   **Alternate Cover Test:** Breaks fusion completely to reveal the total deviation (Phoria + Tropia).

### 3. Assessment of Ocular Movements (Versions and Ductions)
Test in the **9 Diagnostic Positions of Gaze**.
> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> A diagram showing the 'H' pattern of testing ocular movements is essential here

1.  **Primary Position:** Straight ahead.
2.  **Secondary Positions:** Up, Down, Right, Left.
3.  **Tertiary Positions (Oblique):** Up-Right, Up-Left, Down-Right, Down-Left.

**Procedure:**
*   Ask the patient to follow a target (pen/light) in an 'H' pattern.
*   Observe for **Underaction** (restriction/palsy) or **Overaction** of muscles.
*   In paralytic squint, look for the **Secondary Deviation** (deviation of the normal eye when the paretic eye fixes), which is greater than the Primary Deviation.

### 4. Special Tests for Incomitant Squint

**A. [[Diplopia Charting]]**
*   Uses red-green goggles. Patient views a linear light.
*   **Rule:** The image belonging to the paralyzed eye is always projected **peripheral** (outermost) to the true image.
*   **Uncrossed Diplopia:** [[Esotropia]] (Convergent squint).
*   **Crossed Diplopia:** [[Exotropia]] (Divergent squint).

**B. [[Hess Screen]] / Lees Screen**
*   Dissociates the two eyes using red-green filters (Hess) or mirrors (Lees).
*   Maps the fields of the two eyes separately.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   **Smaller field:** Belong to the eye with the **paretic** muscle (underaction).
    *   **Larger field:** Belongs to the sound eye with the **overacting** yoke muscle (Hering’s law).

**C. [[Forced Duction Test]] (FDT)**
*   Differentiates **Restrictive** vs. **Paralytic** squint.
*   Under topical anesthesia, the conjunctiva is grasped with forceps, and the eye is forcibly rotated.
*   **Positive FDT:** Resistance is felt $\rightarrow$ **Restrictive** cause (e.g., Thyroid eye disease, blowout fracture).
*   **Negative FDT:** No resistance $\rightarrow$ **Paralytic** cause (nerve palsy).

**D. [[Force Generation Test]]**
*   Used to assess residual muscle function in paretic eyes. Patient attempts to move the eye against the resistance of the forceps held by the examiner.

**E. [[Park's 3-Step Test]]**
*   Used for diagnosing isolated cyclovertical muscle palsy (specifically [[CN IV palsy]]).
    1.  Which eye is hypertropic in primary gaze?
    2.  Is hypertropia worse on gaze to left or right?
    3.  Is hypertropia worse on head tilt to left or right?.

### 5. Binocular Vision Assessment
*   **[[Worth 4-Dot Test]]:** Tests for suppression and fusion. Patient wears red (right eye) and green (left eye) glasses.
    *   4 dots (1 red, 2 green, 1 mixed): Normal fusion.
    *   2 red dots: Left eye suppression.
    *   3 green dots: Right eye suppression.
    *   5 dots: Diplopia.
*   **[[Synoptophore]]:** Measures subjective and objective angles of squint and assesses grades of binocular vision (SMP, Fusion, Stereopsis).
*   **[[Maddox Rod]]:** Detects heterophoria and cyclodeviation.

### 6. Supranuclear Gaze Testing
*   **Saccades:** Ask patient to look rapidly between two targets. Slow velocity indicates CNS pathology (e.g., PPRF lesion).
*   **Doll's Eye Maneuver (Oculo-cephalic reflex):** Passive head rotation causes eyes to move in opposite direction. Used in comatose patients to test brainstem integrity.

### Clinical Implications
*   **[[Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia]] (INO):** Lesion of [[Medial Longitudinal Fasciculus]] (MLF). Causes ipsilateral adduction deficit and contralateral abduction nystagmus. Hallmark of [[Multiple Sclerosis]].
*   **[[One-and-a-half Syndrome]]:** Lesion of PPRF + MLF on one side. Ipsilateral gaze palsy + INO. The only movement remaining is abduction of the contralateral eye.
*   **[[Thyroid Eye Disease]]:** Causes restrictive myopathy (usually Inferior Rectus fibrosis), leading to restriction in elevation (Positive FDT).
