# Acute Suppurative Otitis Media (ASOM)

**Definition**
[[Acute Suppurative Otitis Media]] (ASOM) is an acute inflammation of the mucoperiosteal lining of the [[middle ear cleft]] caused by pyogenic organisms. The middle ear cleft includes the [[Eustachian tube]], tympanic cavity, attic, aditus, antrum, and [[mastoid air cells]].

### Etiology

**1. Routes of Infection**
*   **Via [[Eustachian tube]] (Most Common):** Infection ascends from the nasopharynx during acute tonsillitis, adenoiditis, sinusitis, or rhinitis. The tube is shorter, wider, and more horizontal in infants, making them more susceptible.
*   **Via [[External Auditory Canal]]:** Through a traumatic perforation of the [[tympanic membrane]].
*   **Hematogenous:** Rare; spread through the bloodstream.

**2. Causative Organisms**
| Organism Type | Pathogens |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Bacteria** (Most Common) | **[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]** (Most common)<br>[[Haemophilus influenzae]] (Non-typeable)<br>[[Moraxella catarrhalis]]<br>[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]<br>[[Staphylococcus aureus]] |
| **Viruses** | Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Influenza virus, Adenovirus (often precede bacterial invasion) |

### Clinical Features and Pathology (Stages of ASOM)

The disease typically progresses through the following stages:

**1. Stage of Tubal Occlusion**
*   **Pathology:** Edema and hyperemia of the nasopharyngeal end of the Eustachian tube lead to blockage. Absorption of air within the middle ear creates negative intratympanic pressure.
*   **Symptoms:** Mild earache, sensation of fullness/blockage, mild [[conductive hearing loss]]. **No fever**.
*   **Otoscopy:** [[Retracted tympanic membrane]]. Handle of malleus appears foreshortened; lateral process is prominent; light reflex is lost.

**2. Stage of Presuppuration (Hyperemia)**
*   **Pathology:** Pyogenic organisms invade the middle ear causing mucosal hyperemia and inflammatory exudation.
*   **Symptoms:** Marked throbbing earache (disturbs sleep), tinnitus, and high fever (102°F–103°F) with restlessness (especially in children).
*   **Otoscopy:** Congestion of pars tensa. Radial blood vessels appear along the handle of malleus and periphery, giving a **[[Cartwheel appearance]]**.
*   **Tuning Fork Tests:** Conductive hearing loss.

**3. Stage of Suppuration**
*   **Pathology:** Frank pus formation in the middle ear and mastoid air cells under tension.
*   **Symptoms:** **Excruciating earache**, increasing deafness, high fever, and potentially vomiting or convulsions in children.
*   **Otoscopy:** Tympanic membrane appears red and **bulging** with loss of landmarks. A yellow spot (pus pointing) may be visible.
*   **Clinical Implication:** This is the stage of impending rupture. If not treated, purulent material may break through the TM or spread to the mastoid.

**4. Stage of Resolution**
*   **Pathology:** The tympanic membrane ruptures due to pressure necrosis, releasing pus. Alternatively, resolution occurs via antibiotic treatment without rupture.
*   **Symptoms:** Earache and fever subside immediately after rupture.
*   **Otoscopy:** 
    *   Perforation (usually small, central/kidney-shaped in pars tensa).
    *   **Pulsatile Otorrhea:** Mucopurulent discharge pulsating synchronously with the pulse. This is known as the **[[Light house sign]]**.
    
**5. Stage of Complications**
*   If virulence is high or resistance is low, the infection spreads beyond the middle ear, leading to mastoiditis or intracranial complications.

### Diagnosis

1.  **Clinical:** History of upper respiratory infection followed by earache and fever.
2.  **Otoscopy:** Evaluation of the tympanic membrane (retracted, cartwheel, bulging, or perforated).
3.  **Tuning Fork Tests:** [[Rinne test]] negative (Bone Conduction > Air Conduction), [[Weber test]] lateralized to the affected ear.
4.  **Audiometry:** Conductive hearing loss.
5.  **Microbiology:** Culture and sensitivity of ear discharge if perforation exists or via tympanocentesis.

### Differential Diagnosis
*   [[Otitis externa]] (Furunculosis)
*   [[Bullous myringitis]]
*   Dental neuralgia (Referred pain)
*   Acute [[mastoiditis]]

### Treatment

**A. Medical Management**
1.  **Systemic Antibiotics:** To control infection.
    *   First line: **[[Amoxicillin]]** (40 mg/kg/day).
    *   If resistant or no improvement after 48-72 hours: Co-amoxiclav (Augmentin).
    *   Alternatives (Penicillin allergy): Erythromycin, Azithromycin, or Cephalosporins.
    *   Duration: Minimum 7-10 days to prevent [[secretory otitis media]].
2.  **Nasal Decongestants:** (e.g., Xylometazoline) to reduce tubal edema and promote ventilation.
3.  **Analgesics and Antipyretics:** (e.g., Paracetamol, Ibuprofen) for pain and fever.
4.  **Local Heat:** Dry heat helps relieve pain.
5.  **Aural Toilet:** If discharge is present, wicking or dry mopping. Avoid ear drops if TM is perforated unless prescribed (antibiotic drops).

**B. Surgical Management: [[Myringotomy]]**
*Incision of the tympanic membrane to drain pus.*

*   **Indications:**
    1.  Bulging tympanic membrane with acute excruciating pain.
    2.  Incomplete resolution with persistent effusion/conductive deafness.
    3.  Acute otitis media with complications (e.g., [[Facial nerve palsy]], [[Labyrinthitis]], Meningitis).
    4.  Recurrent AOM.
    
*   **Technique:**
    *   **Incision:** Curvilinear (J-shaped) incision.
    *   **Site:** **Posteroinferior quadrant** of the pars tensa (to avoid injury to the ossicular chain and allow drainage by gravity).

### Specific Variant: Acute Necrotizing Otitis Media
*   **Cause:** $\beta$-hemolytic Streptococcus (usually following measles, scarlet fever, or influenza).
*   **Pathology:** Rapid necrosis of the entire tympanic membrane, annulus, ossicles, and mastoid air cells.
*   **Outcome:** Profuse foul-smelling discharge and large "kidney-shaped" or total perforation. Often results in [[secondary acquired cholesteatoma]] due to epithelial ingrowth.
*   **Treatment:** Early vigorous IV antibiotics; cortical mastoidectomy may be required.
