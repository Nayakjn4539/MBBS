# [[Anatomy And Physiology]] > Pupil and Pupillary Reflexes

### Anatomy of the Pupil and Iris Muscles

The [[pupil]] acts as an aperture controlling the amount of light entering the eye. Its size is determined by the balance of tone between two smooth muscles of the [[iris]] of ectodermal origin.

| Muscle | Orientation | Action | Nerve Supply | Central Control |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Sphincter Pupillae]]** | Circular band at pupillary margin | **[[Miosis]]** (Constriction) | Parasympathetic (via [[Oculomotor nerve]]) | [[Edinger-Westphal Nucleus]] |
| **[[Dilator Pupillae]]** | Radial fibers near iris root | **[[Mydriasis]]** (Dilatation) | Sympathetic (via [[Long ciliary nerves]]) | Posterior Hypothalamus/ Ciliospinal center |

### The Pupillary Light Reflex (PLR)

The light reflex is a subcortical reflex arc where light entering one eye causes constriction of the pupil in that eye (**Direct Reflex**) and the contralateral eye (**Consensual Reflex**).

> Flowchart of the Pupillary Light Reflex Pathway

#### 1. Afferent Pathway (4 Neurons)
1.  **Receptors:** Light stimulates retinal photoreceptors (Rods and Cones).
2.  **First Order Neuron:** [[Bipolar cells]] of the retina.
3.  **Second Order Neuron:** [[Retinal Ganglion Cells]]. Axons travel via the [[Optic nerve]] $\rightarrow$ [[Optic Chiasma]] (nasal fibers decussate, temporal fibers remain ipsilateral) $\rightarrow$ [[Optic tract]].
    *   *Crucial Point:* Pupillary fibers leave the optic tract **before** reaching the [[Lateral Geniculate Body]].
4.  **Interneurons:** Fibers enter the **[[Pretectal nucleus]]** in the midbrain,.

#### 2. Centre (Internuncial Connection)
*   The pretectal nucleus sends **internuncial neurons** to the [[Edinger-Westphal Nucleus]] (accessory oculomotor nucleus).
*   **Significance:** Each pretectal nucleus sends fibers to **BOTH** ipsilateral and contralateral Edinger-Westphal nuclei. This bilateral connection explains why stimulating one eye causes both pupils to constrict (Consensual Reflex),.

#### 3. Efferent Pathway (Parasympathetic)
1.  **Preganglionic Fibers:** Arise from the **Edinger-Westphal Nucleus** $\rightarrow$ Travel with the [[Oculomotor nerve]] (CN III) $\rightarrow$ Inferior division $\rightarrow$ Nerve to Inferior Oblique $\rightarrow$ Enter [[Ciliary Ganglion]],.
2.  **Relay:** Synapse occurs in the Ciliary Ganglion (located at the orbital apex).
3.  **Postganglionic Fibers:** Travel via **[[Short ciliary nerves]]** $\rightarrow$ Pierce sclera $\rightarrow$ Innervate the **[[Sphincter Pupillae]]** causing constriction,.

### The Near Reflex

This reflex occurs when looking at a near object. It consists of a triad of synkinetic phenomena,:
1.  **[[Convergence]]** (Medial Recti contraction).
2.  **[[Accommodation]]** (Ciliary muscle contraction increasing lens curvature).
3.  **[[Miosis]]** (Pupil constriction to increase depth of focus).

#### Pathway Distinctions
*   Unlike the light reflex, the near reflex pathway involves the **cortical visual areas**.
*   Impulses go from Retina $\rightarrow$ Visual Cortex $\rightarrow$ Parastriate Cortex $\rightarrow$ Occipitomesencephalic tract $\rightarrow$ Pontine Centre $\rightarrow$ Edinger-Westphal Nucleus.
*   *Clinical Implication:* Because the near reflex bypasses the pretectal nucleus, lesions in the dorsal midbrain (pretectal area) can abolish the light reflex while sparing the near reflex (**[[Light-Near Dissociation]]**).

### Other Reflexes

1.  **[[Psychosensory Reflex]]**: Sensory stimulation (pain) or emotional excitement (fear) causes pupillary **dilatation**. This is mediated by sympathetic stimulation and inhibition of the parasympathetic tone,.
2.  **[[Ciliospinal Reflex]]**: Pinching the skin of the neck causes ipsilateral pupil dilatation.

---

### The Sympathetic Pupillary Pathway (Dilator Pathway)

This pathway is responsible for mydriasis and maintaining eyelid tone. It consists of a **3-neuron chain**,:

1.  **First Order (Central):** Posterior [[Hypothalamus]] $\rightarrow$ Descends uncrossed through brainstem $\rightarrow$ **Ciliospinal Center of Budge** (Spinal cord C8-T2),.
2.  **Second Order (Preganglionic):** Ciliospinal Center $\rightarrow$ Exits spinal cord $\rightarrow$ Travels over lung apex (relation to Pancoast tumor) $\rightarrow$ Relays in **[[Superior Cervical Ganglion]]**,.
3.  **Third Order (Postganglionic):** Superior Cervical Ganglion $\rightarrow$ Ascends along [[Internal Carotid Artery]] plexus $\rightarrow$ Cavernous Sinus $\rightarrow$ Joins Ophthalmic nerve (V1) $\rightarrow$ Nasociliary nerve $\rightarrow$ **[[Long ciliary nerves]]** $\rightarrow$ **[[Dilator Pupillae]]**,.

*Clinical Note:* Interruption of this pathway causes [[Horner's Syndrome]].

### Clinical Abnormalities of the Pupil

#### 1. [[Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect]] (RAPD) / Marcus Gunn Pupil
*   **Pathology:** Incomplete optic nerve lesion or severe retinal disease. The conduction signal is weaker on the affected side,.
*   **Diagnosis:** **Swinging Flashlight Test**.
*   **Reaction:**
    *   Light on normal eye $\rightarrow$ Both constrict.
    *   Light swung to affected eye $\rightarrow$ **Paradoxical Dilatation** (because the direct drive is weaker than the consensual drive from the removed light on the good eye),.
*   **Key Feature:** Pupils are isocoric (equal size) at rest.

#### 2. [[Argyll Robertson Pupil]] (ARP)
*   **Site of Lesion:** Tectum/Pretectal area (dorsal aspect of Edinger-Westphal nucleus).
*   **Etiology:** **[[Neurosyphilis]]** (Tabes Dorsalis),.
*   **Features (Mnemonic: ARP-PRA):**
    *   **A**ccommodation **R**eflex **P**resent.
    *   **P**upillary (**L**ight) **R**eflex **A**bsent.
*   **Characteristics:** Bilateral, small (miotic), irregular pupils that do not dilate well with mydriatics,.

#### 3. [[Adie's Tonic Pupil]]
*   **Site of Lesion:** [[Ciliary Ganglion]] or short ciliary nerves (Post-ganglionic parasympathetic denervation),.
*   **Etiology:** Viral illness, trauma, or idiopathic. Common in young females.
*   **Features:**
    *   Unilateral, large (dilated) pupil.
    *   Absent/slugish light reaction.
    *   **Tonic** near reflex (slow constriction and very slow redilation).
    *   **Vermiform movements** of the iris sphincter on slit lamp.
    *   Associated with diminished deep tendon reflexes (Holmes-Adie Syndrome).
*   **Pharmacological Test:** Constricts with dilute (0.125%) **[[Pilocarpine]]** due to **denervation hypersensitivity** (Normal pupil does not constrict),.

#### 4. [[Horner's Syndrome]] (Oculosympathetic Palsy)
*   **Features (Mnemonic: HIMAPLE):**
    *   **H**eterochromia iridis (if congenital).
    *   **I**nferior eyelid elevation (Reverse ptosis).
    *   **M**iosis (unopposed sphincter action).
    *   **A**nhydrosis (loss of sweating on face).
    *   **P**tosis (Paralysis of Muller's muscle).
    *   **L**oss of ciliospinal reflex.
    *   **E**nophthalmos (apparent),.
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   **4% or 10% [[Cocaine]]**: Normal pupil dilates; Horner's pupil **does not dilate** (Loss of Norepinephrine reuptake),.
    *   **Apraclonidine**: Horner's pupil dilates (denervation hypersensitivity); Normal pupil does not.

#### 5. [[Wernicke's Hemianopic Pupil]]
*   **Site of Lesion:** **[[Optic Tract]]**.
*   **Reaction:** Light projected onto the blind hemiretina (ipsilateral temporal, contralateral nasal) causes no pupillary reaction. Light on the seeing hemiretina causes constriction,.
*   *Note:* Difficult to elicit clinically due to light scatter.

#### 6. [[Hutchinson's Pupil]]
*   **Sequence:** Seen in uncal herniation (head injury).
*   **Stages:**
    1.  Ipsilateral miosis (irritation).
    2.  Ipsilateral mydriasis (paralysis of CN III).
    3.  Bilateral mydriasis (advanced compression).
