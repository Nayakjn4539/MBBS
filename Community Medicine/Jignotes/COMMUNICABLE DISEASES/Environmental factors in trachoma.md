# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Environmental factors in trachoma

### Environmental Factors in [[Community Medicine/Jignotes/COMMUNICABLE DISEASES/Trachoma]]

Trachoma, a chronic infectious disease of the conjunctiva and cornea caused by **[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]** (Serotypes A, B, C), is a major cause of preventable blindness. It is often described as a disease of the "unwashed and underprivileged." The environment plays a crucial role in the transmission and persistence of the disease.

#### 1. Climatic and Seasonal Factors
*   **Season:** Seasonal epidemics are often associated with a massive increase in the population of **[[eye-seeking flies]]**.
*   **Temperature and Rainfall:** Higher temperatures and rainfall favour the breeding of flies, leading to increased transmission. In India, the incidence of active trachoma typically peaks during April-May and July-September.
*   **Irritants:** Exposure to environmental irritants such as direct sunlight, dust, and smoke predisposes individuals to infection.

#### 2. Socio-Economic and Living Conditions ("Quality of Life")
Trachoma thrives in poor living conditions. It is strongly associated with:
*   **Poverty:** It is a disease of the poor and is often endemic in rural areas and urban slums.
*   **Overcrowding:** Living in crowded conditions increases physical contact and the spread of infection.
*   **Housing:** Poor housing conditions and squalor contribute to the persistence of the disease.
*   **Illiteracy and Ignorance:** Lack of awareness regarding hygiene and transmission contributes to the spread.

#### 3. Water and Sanitation (Water-Washed Disease)
*   **Water Scarcity:** Trachoma is classified as a **[[water-washed disease]]**. A lack of adequate water supply leads to poor personal hygiene.
*   **Face Washing:** The frequency of face washing is directly related to the availability of water. Fewer face washes result in a higher frequency of trachomatous afflictions.
*   **Sanitation:** Inadequate disposal of human and animal excreta provides breeding grounds for flies, which act as mechanical vectors.

#### 4. Vectors (The Fly Factor)
*   **Eye-seeking Flies:** Flies such as *Musca sorbens* and *Musca domestica* play a significant role in the mechanical transmission of the agent.
*   **Transmission:** They feed on ocular discharges and transfer the infection from infected persons to healthy ones.

#### 5. Social and Cultural Customs
*   **Fomites:** The use of common towels, handkerchiefs, and bedding facilitates transmission.
*   **Cosmetics:** The custom of applying **[[kajal]]** or **[[surma]]** to the eyes is a recognized risk factor. The applicator stick often serves as a fomite, transferring infection between eyes and individuals.

#### 6. Familial Clustering
*   Trachoma is often a familial disease. If one member is infected, others in the family group are likely to be infected due to continuous re-infection (feedback infection), particularly among siblings or grandparents tending to small children.

### Prevention: The SAFE Strategy
The WHO recommends the **[[SAFE strategy]]** for the global elimination of blinding trachoma. The **'E'** specifically targets environmental factors:

*   **S:** Surgery (for Trichiasis and Entropion)
*   **A:** Antibiotics (Azithromycin/Tetracycline)
*   **F:** Facial Cleanliness
*   **E:** **Environmental Improvement**

**Environmental Improvements include:**
1.  Improving water supply to enable face washing.
2.  Better sanitation and waste disposal to reduce fly breeding.
3.  Health education regarding personal hygiene.

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Blinding Trachoma:** The disease progresses from active inflammation (follicles) to scarring. Environmental factors drive the re-infection required to cause the scarring (Trichiasis/Entropion) that leads to blindness.
*   **Herbert's Pits:** These are healed sequelae of limbal follicles and are a diagnostic sign.

### Mnemonic
To remember the risk factors, use **"DUST"**:

*   **D** - **D**irty faces (lack of water/hygiene) & **D**irect contact (Fomites/Kajal).
*   **U** - **U**nsanitary conditions (Fly breeding).
*   **S** - **S**carcity of water & **S**eason (Fly season).
*   **T** - **T**ransmission by Flies & **T**ogetherness (Overcrowding).
