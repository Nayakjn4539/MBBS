# Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC)

### Overview
**Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC)** is a squamous cell malignancy arising from the epithelial lining of the nasopharynx. It is biologically and clinically distinct from other head and neck cancers.

*   **Most Common Site of Origin:** [[Fossa of Rosenmüller]] (Lateral pharyngeal recess).
*   **Epidemiology:**
    *   **Geography:** Highest incidence in Southern China (Guangdong region), Southeast Asia, and Africa (Tunisia, Sudan).
    *   **Age:** Bimodal distribution. Peaks at 15–25 years and 55–65 years.
    *   **Sex:** Males are affected 3 times more than females.

### Etiology and Risk Factors
The etiology is multifactorial, involving an interplay of genetic, viral, and environmental factors.

1.  **Viral:** Strong association with [[Epstein-Barr Virus]] (EBV) infection.
    *   EBV DNA and antibodies (IgA against VCA and EA) are markers for screening and monitoring.
    *   Type II and III histologies are strongly associated with EBV.
2.  **Genetic:**
    *   Genetic susceptibility in Chinese (Mongoloid race) populations.
    *   Specific HLA antigens (HLA-A2, HLA-B Sin 2) are associated with increased risk.
3.  **Environmental/Dietary:**
    *   **Nitrosamines:** Found in salted fish and preserved foods (common in Cantonese diet).
    *   **Polycyclic Hydrocarbons:** From burning incense and wood smoke.
    *   Smoking and alcohol.

### Histopathological Classification (WHO)
The World Health Organization classifies NPC into three types based on light microscopy:

| WHO Type | Description | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type I** | [[Keratinizing Squamous Cell Carcinoma]] | Similar to other head/neck cancers; worse prognosis; less radiosensitive. |
| **Type II** | [[Non-keratinizing Differentiated Carcinoma]] | Associated with EBV; radiosensitive. |
| **Type III** | [[Non-keratinizing Undifferentiated Carcinoma]] | **Most common type** in endemic areas; strongly associated with EBV; most aggressive but **most radiosensitive**. |

### Routes of Spread
1.  **Local Spread:**
    *   **Anterior:** Into the nasal cavity (causing obstruction).
    *   **Inferior:** Into the [[Oropharynx]].
    *   **Lateral:** Into the [[Parapharyngeal space]] and [[Sinus of Morgagni]].
    *   **Superior (Intracranial):** Through the [[Foramen lacerum]] and [[Foramen ovale]] into the middle cranial fossa.
2.  **Lymphatic Spread:**
    *   Very common (60–90% at presentation).
    *   First echelon: [[Retropharyngeal lymph nodes]] (Nodes of Rouviere).
    *   Subsequent spread: Upper deep cervical nodes (Level II) $\rightarrow$ Posterior triangle nodes (Level V).
    *   Bilateral involvement is common.
3.  **Distant Metastasis:**
    *   Common sites: Bone (spine), Lung, and Liver.

### Clinical Features
Symptoms can be grouped by the structure involved.

*   **Cervical (Most Common):**
    *   Painless [[Cervical lymphadenopathy]] is the presenting complaint in up to 90% of cases. Often bilateral or posterior triangle nodes.
*   **Otologic:**
    *   Unilateral [[Serous Otitis Media]] (SOM) due to [[Eustachian tube]] obstruction.
    *   Symptoms: Conductive hearing loss, tinnitus, aural fullness.
    *   **Clinical Implication:** Any adult with unexplained unilateral serous otitis media must be evaluated for NPC.
*   **Nasal:**
    *   Nasal obstruction, epistaxis, blood-stained nasal discharge.
    *   Denasal speech (Rhinolalia clausa).
*   **Neurological:**
    *   **Cranial Nerve VI (Abducens):** Most common nerve involved, causing lateral rectus palsy and diplopia.
    *   **Cranial Nerve V (Trigeminal):** Facial pain/paresthesia.
    *   **Jugular Foramen Syndrome:** Involvement of CN IX, X, XI.
    *   **Horner's Syndrome:** Ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis due to cervical sympathetic chain involvement.

#### Trotter's Triad (Sinus of Morgagni Syndrome)
Caused by lateral spread involving the Sinus of Morgagni.
**Mnemonic: NPC**
1.  **N**euralgia (Ipsilateral mandibular nerve/trigeminal neuralgia).
2.  **P**alatal paralysis (Ipsilateral soft palate immobility).
3.  **C**onductive deafness (Due to Eustachian tube obstruction).

### Diagnosis and Investigations
1.  **Nasal Endoscopy:**
    *   Visualization of mass in the [[Fossa of Rosenmüller]].
    *   Appearance: Proliferative, ulcerative, or infiltrative.
2.  **Biopsy:**
    *   Essential for definitive diagnosis.
3.  **Imaging:**
    *   **Contrast-Enhanced CT (CECT):** Evaluates bone erosion (skull base) and extent of tumor.
    *   **MRI:** Investigation of choice for soft tissue extension, intracranial spread, and perineural invasion.
    *   **PET Scan:** For detecting distant metastasis and recurrent disease.
4.  **Serology:**
    *   **IgA anti-VCA** (Viral Capsid Antigen) and **IgA anti-EA** (Early Antigen) for EBV.
    *   Used for screening high-risk populations and monitoring treatment response.

### Staging (TNM Overview)
Based on AJCC/UICC classification. Note that N staging in NPC differs from other head and neck cancers.

*   **T (Tumor):**
    *   **T1:** Confined to Nasopharynx.
    *   **T2:** Extension to Parapharyngeal space.
    *   **T3:** Bony structures/Paranasal sinuses involved.
    *   **T4:** Intracranial/Orbit/Cranial Nerve involvement.
*   **N (Node):**
    *   **N1:** Unilateral (above supraclavicular fossa, $\le$ 6cm).
    *   **N2:** Bilateral (above supraclavicular fossa, $\le$ 6cm).
    *   **N3:** >6cm OR in the **Supraclavicular fossa** (Ho's Triangle).

### Treatment
The tumor is deeply located and surgically inaccessible but highly radiosensitive.

1.  **Radiotherapy (RT):**
    *   **Mainstay of treatment** for all stages.
    *   Dose: 6000–7000 cGy.
    *   Technique: **IMRT** (Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy) is preferred to spare critical structures (eyes, brainstem, spinal cord).
2.  **Chemotherapy:**
    *   Used concurrently with RT for Stage III and IV (Locally advanced disease).
    *   Agents: [[Cisplatin]], [[5-fluorouracil]] (5-FU).
    *   Induction or adjuvant chemotherapy may also be used.
3.  **Surgery:**
    *   Limited role due to difficult access.
    *   **Indications:**
        *   Salvage for residual/recurrent neck nodes ([[Neck Dissection]]).
        *   Salvage nasopharyngectomy for local recurrence (e.g., Maxillary swing approach).
