# Multidrug Therapy (MDT)

### **Definition and Concept**
**Multidrug Therapy (MDT)** refers to the administration of two or more drugs in combination to treat a disease. It is the fundamental strategy (sheet-anchor) for the prevention and control of communicable diseases like [[Leprosy]], [[Tuberculosis]], and [[HIV]] at both individual and community levels.

### **Objectives of MDT**
The primary goals of using combination therapy are:
1.  **Interrupt Transmission:** To render infectious patients non-infectious rapidly, breaking the chain of transmission in the community,.
2.  **Cure the Patient:** To achieve complete bacteriological cure and prevent relapse,.
3.  **Prevent Resistance:** To prevent the emergence of drug-resistant strains (e.g., secondary resistance) which occurs when single drugs (monotherapy) are used,.

### **1. MDT in Leprosy (National Leprosy Eradication Programme)**
Historically, dapsone monotherapy led to widespread resistance; thus, WHO recommended MDT using bactericidal drugs.

#### **Drugs Used**
*   **[[Rifampicin]] (R):** Highly bactericidal; kills 99.9% of organisms (600 mg dose).
*   **[[Clofazimine]] (C):** Bacteriostatic and anti-inflammatory; prevents reactions,.
*   **[[Dapsone]] (D):** Weak bactericidal/bacteriostatic; safe in doses up to 100 mg,.

**Clinical Relevance:**
*   **Rifampicin:** Causes orange/red discoloration of urine (warn the patient!).
*   **Clofazimine:** Causes brownish/black skin pigmentation.
*   **Dapsone:** Can cause hemolytic anemia (check Hb) or exfoliative dermatitis.

#### **Regimens (Adults)**
Treatment is based on the classification into Paucibacillary (PB) or Multibacillary (MB).

| Feature | **Paucibacillary (PB)** | **Multibacillary (MB)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Criteria** | 1–5 Skin lesions | $\ge$ 6 Skin lesions |
| **Duration** | **6 Months** | **12 Months** |
| **Regimen** | **Rifampicin:** 600 mg (Monthly supervised)<br>**Dapsone:** 100 mg (Daily self-administered) | **Rifampicin:** 600 mg (Monthly supervised)<br>**Clofazimine:** 300 mg (Monthly supervised) + 50 mg (Daily)<br>**Dapsone:** 100 mg (Daily) |
| **Follow Up** | Annually for 2 years | Annually for 5 years |

### **2. MDT in Tuberculosis (NTEP)**
Under the [[National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme]], MDT is administered via **[[DOTS]]** (Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course) to kill both rapidly multiplying bacilli and dormant "persisters",.

#### **Standard Regimen for Drug-Sensitive TB (Adults)**
*   **Intensive Phase (IP):** 2 Months of **HRZE** ([[Isoniazid]], [[Rifampicin]], [[Pyrazinamide]], [[Ethambutol]]).
*   **Continuation Phase (CP):** 4 Months of **HRE** (Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Ethambutol).
*   **Fixed Dose Combinations (FDCs):** Drugs are given daily as per weight bands to improve compliance,.

**Mnemonic for TB First-Line Drugs:** **RIPE**
*   **R**ifampicin
*   **I**soniazid
*   **P**yrazinamide
*   **E**thambutol

#### **Drug Resistance**
*   **[[MDR-TB]]:** Resistance to at least Isoniazid and Rifampicin.
*   **[[XDR-TB]]:** MDR-TB + Resistance to any fluoroquinolone + at least one Group A drug (e.g., Bedaquiline, Linezolid),.
*   **Treatment:** Requires longer regimens (18-20 months) or shorter oral regimens containing newer drugs like [[Bedaquiline]],.

### **3. MDT in HIV/AIDS (NACP)**
**[[Antiretroviral Therapy]] (ART)** uses a combination of at least three ARV drugs from different classes to inhibit HIV replication and reduce viral load.

#### **Preferred First-Line Regimen (Adults & Adolescents)**
*   **TLD Regimen:** A Fixed Dose Combination (FDC) of:
    1.  **Tenofovir** (TDF) 300 mg
    2.  **Lamivudine** (3TC) 300 mg
    3.  **Dolutegravir** (DTG) 50 mg.
*   **Administration:** Single pill taken once daily.

---

### **4. MDT in Malaria (NVBDCP)**
To prevent resistance in *Plasmodium falciparum*, monotherapy (artemisinin alone) is banned. **[[Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy]] (ACT)** is the standard.

*   **P. falciparum (General):** Artesunate (3 days) + Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine (1 day) + Single dose Primaquine (Day 2).
*   **P. falciparum (North-East India):** Artemether + Lumefantrine (ACT-AL) + Single dose Primaquine.
*   **P. vivax:** Chloroquine (3 days) + Primaquine (14 days).

### **Advantages of Multidrug Therapy**
1.  **Shorter Duration:** MDT has curtailed the duration of leprosy treatment considerably compared to dapsone monotherapy.
2.  **Cost-Effectiveness:** Shorter therapy leads to better compliance and lower workload for health systems.
3.  **Reduced Failure Rates:** Combination drugs act on different metabolic pathways of the organism, reducing the chance of survival for resistant mutants.
