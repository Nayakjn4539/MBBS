# [[Central Serous Chorioretinopathy]] (CSCR)

### **Definition**
**Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR)**, previously known as **Central Serous Retinopathy (CSR)**, is a condition characterized by the spontaneous serous detachment of the [[neurosensory retina]] in the macular region, with or without an associated detachment of the [[retinal pigment epithelium]] (RPE). It results from the accumulation of fluid in the [[subretinal space]].

### **Epidemiology and Risk Factors**
The condition is typically idiopathic and self-limiting.
*   **Age:** Typically affects young to middle-aged adults (20–50 years).
*   **Gender:** Males are affected significantly more than females.
*   **Personality:** Often seen in individuals with **Type A personality** (stress-prone, competitive).
*   **Systemic Associations:**
    *   **Steroid intake:** A major risk factor (topical or systemic).
    *   [[Cushing's syndrome]].
    *   Emotional stress.
    *   [[Helicobacter pylori]] infection.
    *   Pregnancy (usually 3rd trimester).
    *   [[Systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE).
    *   Niacin/nicotine usage.

### **Etiopathogenesis**
The exact mechanism is not fully understood, but the current accepted theory involves:
1.  **Choroidal Vascular Hyperpermeability:** This is the primary event.
2.  **RPE Dysfunction:** The pump mechanism of the [[retinal pigment epithelium]] fails or is overwhelmed.
3.  **Fluid Accumulation:** Fluid leaks through a defect in [[Bruch's membrane]] and the RPE into the subretinal space, causing the detachment of the sensory retina.

### **Clinical Features**
#### **Symptoms**
*   **Sudden painless loss of vision** or blurred vision.
*   **Relative Positive [[Scotoma]]:** Patient perceives a shadowed area in the central visual field.
*   **[[Micropsia]]:** Objects appear smaller than they are.
*   **[[Metamorphopsia]]:** Straight lines appear distorted or wavy.
*   **Hypermetropic Shift:** Visual acuity (often 6/9–6/12) improves with the addition of convex (plus) lenses due to the anterior elevation of the retina.

#### **Signs**
*   **Macular Elevation:** A dome-shaped elevation of the neurosensory retina at the posterior pole.
*   **Ring Reflex:** A circular, glistening light reflex demarcating the edge of the detachment.
*   **Loss of Foveal Reflex:** The normal bright foveal reflex is absent or distorted.
*   **Subretinal Precipitates:** Small yellow-grey elevations may be seen on the posterior surface of the detached retina.

### **Classification**
| Type | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Typical / Acute CSCR** | Short course, spontaneous resolution within 3–6 months with near-normal visual recovery. |
| **Chronic CSCR** | Also called **Diffuse Retinal Pigment Epitheliopathy (DRPE)**. Lasts >12 months. Causes progressive RPE atrophy and permanent visual impairment. |
| **Bullous CSCR** | Rare; characterized by large, numerous areas of serous detachment. Can be confused with bullous [[retinal detachment]]. |

### **Diagnostic Investigations**

#### **1. Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA)**
FFA helps confirm diagnosis and locate the leakage point.
*   **Ink-blot Pattern:** A small hyperfluorescent spot appears in the early phase and gradually increases in size (most common pattern).
*   **Smoke-stack Pattern:** A hyperfluorescent spot ascends vertically (like smoke) and then spreads laterally to form a mushroom or umbrella configuration (due to convection currents).

#### **2. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)**
*   Shows the **neurosensory retinal detachment** (subretinal fluid accumulation).
*   May show accompanying small detachments of the [[retinal pigment epithelium]] (PED).
*   Useful for monitoring resolution.

#### **3. Indocyanine Green Angiography (ICG)**
*   Reveals multiple areas of hyperfluorescence indicating choroidal hyperpermeability.

### **Differential Diagnosis**
*   [[Optic disc pit]] with serous macular detachment.
*   Idiopathic polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (IPCV).
*   [[Choroidal tumor]] (e.g., hemangioma, melanoma).
*   Exudative [[Age-related Macular Degeneration]] (AMD).
*   [[Cystoid Macular Edema]] (CME).

### **Treatment**

#### **1. Conservative Management (Observation)**
*   **Reassurance:** Most cases (80–90%) resolve spontaneously within 1–6 months with visual acuity returning to normal.
*   **Stop Steroids:** Discontinue systemic or topical corticosteroids if possible.
*   **Lifestyle:** Stress reduction.

#### **2. Laser Photocoagulation**
*   **Indications:**
    *   Long-standing cases (>3-4 months).
    *   Recurrent CSCR with visual loss.
    *   Occupational need for rapid visual recovery.
    *   Permanent visual loss in the fellow eye.
*   **Contraindication:** Do not perform if the leak is within the **foveal avascular zone (FAZ)**.

#### **3. Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)**
*   Uses [[verteporfin]] dye.
*   Indicated for **subfoveal leaks**, chronic cases, or severe disease not amenable to conventional laser.

#### **4. Anti-VEGF Agents**
*   Considered if secondary [[choroidal neovascularization]] (CNV) develops.

**Clinical Implication:** Systemic **steroids** are absolutely **contraindicated** in the treatment of CSCR as they can aggravate the condition.

### **Complications**
*   **[[Cystoid Macular Edema]] (CME):** Can occur in chronic cases.
*   **Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV):** Invasion of sub-pigment epithelial space by new vessels.
*   **Retinal Pigment Epithelium Decompensation:** Extensive degeneration following recurrences.

*   **E**levated Cortisol (Cushing's/Steroids)
