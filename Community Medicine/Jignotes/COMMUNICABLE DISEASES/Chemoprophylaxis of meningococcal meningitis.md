# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Chemoprophylaxis of meningococcal meningitis

# Chemoprophylaxis of Meningococcal Meningitis

### **Goal of Chemoprophylaxis**
The primary aim is to eradicate the **nasopharyngeal carriage** of [[Neisseria meningitidis]] to prevent secondary cases. Treatment of the active disease case with penicillin does *not* eradicate the carrier state; therefore, even the patient requires chemoprophylaxis prior to discharge.

### **Target Population for Prophylaxis**
Chemoprophylaxis is indicated for **close contacts** of a confirmed case.
*   **Household contacts:** People living in the same house.
*   **Close community contacts:** Child care centers, preschools, or anyone with direct prolonged contact with the patient's oral secretions (e.g., kissing, sharing utensils).
*   **Timing:** Ideally, treatment should be initiated within **24 hours** of the identification of the index case. Risk of secondary disease decreases significantly after 10–14 days.

### **Recommended Drug Regimens**

The following antibiotics are effective for eradicating the carriage of the invasive strain.

| Drug | Dosage (Adult) | Duration/Route | Remarks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Rifampicin]]** | **600 mg** | **Twice daily for 2 days** (Oral) | **Drug of Choice** for contacts. Urine may turn orange. Contraindicated in pregnancy. |
| **[[Ciprofloxacin]]** | 500 mg | **Single Dose** (Oral) | Preferred for adults due to ease of single dose. |
| **[[Ceftriaxone]]** | 250 mg | **Single Dose** (Intramuscular) | Drug of choice for **pregnant women**. |
| **Azithromycin** | 500 mg | Single Dose (Oral) | Alternative oral agent. |

> **Note:** [[Minocycline]] and [[Spiramycin]] are also mentioned as effective agents in some protocols.

### **Mass Chemoprophylaxis**
Mass chemoprophylaxis involves medicating the total population (some of whom are not infected).

*   **Indication:** It is **NOT** recommended for the general community. It is restricted to **closed and medically supervised communities** (e.g., barracks, hostels, refugee camps) during an epidemic.
*   **Effect:** It causes an immediate drop in the incidence rate and the proportion of carriers.
*   **Efficacy:** Depends entirely on achieving high population coverage.

### **Clinical Relevance: The "Tip of the Iceberg"**
In [[Meningococcal disease]], clinical cases represent a negligible source of infection compared to carriers.
*   **Carrier Rate:** During inter-epidemic periods, 4–35% of the population may harbor the organism. During epidemics, the carrier rate may rise to **70–80%**.
*   **Significance:** Isolation of cases is of limited use in controlling epidemics because healthy carriers vastly outnumber clinical cases. Therefore, eradicating the carrier state through chemoprophylaxis is crucial for contacts.
