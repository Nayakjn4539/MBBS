| **Proliferative Breast Disease Without Atypia** A group of benign epithelial lesions characterized by the proliferation of epithelial cells without atypia, associated with a small increase in breast cancer risk. | - | Confers a 1.5- to 2-fold increased risk of subsequent carcinoma. | These lesions are considered predictors of risk, rather than direct precursors of carcinoma. The proliferation of epithelial cells fills and distends ducts and lobules. | - | **Radial scar:** Irregular shape that closely mimics invasive carcinoma. Central nidus of entrapped glands in a hyalinized stroma surrounded by long radiating projections. | **Epithelial hyperplasia:** Increased numbers of both luminal and myoepithelial cells fill ducts/lobules; irregular slit-like fenestrations at the periphery. **Sclerosing adenosis:** Increased number of acini, compressed and distorted centrally, with stromal fibrosis. **Papilloma:** Grow within a dilated duct, composed of multiple branching fibrovascular cores lined by myoepithelial and luminal cells. | Often detected as mammographic densities or calcifications, or as incidental findings. Large duct papillomas are the most common cause of bloody or serous nipple discharge. | - | 1. **Epithelial hyperplasia** (moderate or florid) 2. **Sclerosing adenosis** 3. **Complex sclerosing lesion (Radial scar)** 4. **Papilloma** (large duct and small duct types) | Small increased risk for subsequent development of invasive carcinoma in either breast. | - |
| **Carcinoma of the Breast** Malignant neoplasms, almost all of which are adenocarcinomas, arising from the terminal duct lobular unit. Classified into major molecular subtypes based on hormone receptor and HER2 expression. | Arise through stepwise acquisition of driver mutations. Development is influenced by hormonal milieu (estrogen). Can be sporadic or due to inherited germline mutations. | **Major:** Female gender, increasing age, germline mutations, personal/family history, high breast density, high-dose radiation to chest. **Hormonal:** Early menarche (<12), late menopause (>55), nulliparity, late first pregnancy (>35), postmenopausal hormone therapy. **Lifestyle:** High alcohol consumption, postmenopausal obesity. | **1. Luminal (ER-positive) Pathway:** Estrogen exposure drives proliferation -> accumulation of mutations. Precursors include flat epithelial atypia and atypical hyperplasia. Acquiring mutations in genes like **PIK3CA**. High-grade forms often gain **TP53** mutations. **2. HER2-positive Pathway:** Driven by **HER2** gene amplification on chromosome 17q. Leads to stimulation of RAS and PI3K-AKT pathways, promoting proliferation and opposing apoptosis. Often associated with **TP53** mutations. **3. Triple-Negative (TNBC) Pathway:** Estrogen-independent. Often associated with germline **BRCA1** mutations or epigenetic silencing of BRCA1, leading to defects in DNA repair (**homologous recombination**) and marked genomic instability. | **Germline (High Penetrance):** **BRCA1/BRCA2** (DNA repair, cause 80-90% of single-gene familial cancers), **TP53** (Li-Fraumeni syndrome), **PTEN** (Cowden), **CDH1** (Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer), **PALB2**. **Sporadic (by subtype):** **Luminal:** **PIK3CA** (45% low-grade, 29% high-grade), **TP53** (12% low-grade, 29% high-grade). **HER2-positive:** **HER2 (ERBB2) amplification**, **TP53** (70-80%), **PIK3CA** (39%). **TNBC:** **TP53** (70-80%), **PIK3CA** (9%). Often have BRCA1 silencing. | Most commonly a hard, irregular mass (scirrhous). May be deceptively well-circumscribed. Produces a grating sound when cut or scraped due to desmoplastic stroma. Can invade skin (dimpling, retraction) or chest wall. | Adenocarcinomas graded using the **Nottingham Histologic Score (Grade 1-3)** based on: 1. Tubule formation 2. Nuclear pleomorphism 3. Mitotic rate.  **Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS):** Clonal proliferation confined to ducts/lobules. Types include comedo, cribriform, micropapillary. Myoepithelial cells preserved. **Lobular Carcinoma in Situ (LCIS):** Dyscohesive cells (loss of E-cadherin) in ducts/lobules. No necrosis/calcifications. **Invasive Lobular Carcinoma:** Infiltrating dyscohesive single cells, often in single-file lines. Loss of E-cadherin. | Palpable mass, nipple discharge (often bloody), skin changes (retraction, dimpling), inflammatory changes. Most common presentation is an abnormal mammogram (density or calcifications). TNBC more likely to present as a palpable mass. | **ER, PR, and HER2** status is essential for classification and treatment planning. **Ki-67** measures proliferation rate. Gene expression profiling assays are used for prognosis in luminal cancers. | **Molecular:** 1. **Luminal (ER-positive/HER2-negative)**: A and B subtypes based on proliferation. 2. **HER2 (HER2-positive)**: Can be ER-positive or negative. 3. **Triple-Negative (TNBC) (ER-negative/HER2-negative)**. **Histologic:** In situ vs Invasive. Invasive types include "No Special Type" (Ductal), Lobular, Tubular, Mucinous, Medullary, etc. | Regional lymph node metastasis (most important prognostic factor). Distant metastasis (bone, viscera, brain). Local recurrence. Prognosis is determined by molecular subtype and **anatomic stage** (AJCC staging system). | **Local:** Surgery (breast-conserving or mastectomy), radiation. **Systemic (based on subtype):** **Luminal:** Endocrine therapy (e.g., tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors), CDK4/6 inhibitors. **HER2+:** Anti-HER2 targeted therapy (e.g., trastuzumab). **TNBC:** Chemotherapy, PARP inhibitors (for BRCA carriers), immune checkpoint inhibitors. |
| **Fibroadenoma** The most common benign tumor of the female breast. A biphasic tumor with stromal and epithelial components, arising from the intralobular stroma. | Arises from intralobular stroma. Hormonally responsive. | Most common in women in their 20s and 30s. Use of cyclosporin A after renal transplant. | Driven by somatic mutations in **MED12**. It's suggested that MED12 mutations alter the expression of sex hormone-regulated genes, controlling the proliferation and survival of certain types of stromal cells. | Driver mutations in **MED12** are present in two-thirds of cases. | Vary from <1 cm to large tumors. Well-circumscribed, rubbery, grayish-white nodules that bulge above the surrounding tissue and often contain slit-like spaces. | Biphasic tumor with delicate, often myxoid stroma resembling normal intralobular stroma. The epithelium is surrounded by stroma (**pericanalicular** pattern) or compressed and distorted by it (**intracanalicular** pattern). In older women, stroma becomes hyalinized. | Usually presents as a palpable, mobile mass in young women. In older women, may present as a mammographic density or clustered calcifications. | - | **Simple Fibroadenoma** vs. **Complex Fibroadenoma** (features like cysts >0.3 cm, sclerosing adenosis, epithelial calcifications, or papillary apocrine change). | Slightly increased risk of carcinoma, particularly if "complex" features are present. May grow in size during pregnancy and regress after menopause. | Observation or surgical excision if large or symptomatic. |
| **Phyllodes Tumor** A biphasic tumor arising from intralobular stroma, much less common than fibroadenoma, with potential for recurrence and metastasis. | Arises from intralobular stroma. | Presents in the sixth decade, 10-20 years later than the peak age for fibroadenoma. | Similar to fibroadenoma, driven by \*\*MED12\*\* mutations. Malignant behavior is associated with acquisition of additional mutations, such as in the \*\*TERT\*\* gene, which encodes telomerase. | **MED12** mutations in majority of cases. Malignant tumors are more likely to have mutations in additional genes like **TERT**. | Vary from a few centimeters to massive lesions. Larger lesions often have bulbous, \*\*leaf-like\*\* (\*\*phyllodes\*\*) protrusions due to nodules of proliferating stroma. | Distinguished from fibroadenoma by higher stromal cellularity, higher mitotic rate, nuclear pleomorphism, stromal overgrowth, and infiltrative borders. | Most are detected as palpable masses. | - | **Low-grade (benign)** **Borderline** **High-grade (malignant)** | Local recurrence is common, especially for borderline and high-grade tumors. High-grade lesions can give rise to distant hematogenous metastases (only the stromal component metastasizes). Lymphatic spread is rare. | Wide excision or mastectomy. Axillary lymph node dissection is contraindicated. |
| **Lesions of Interlobular Stroma** Tumors of the interlobular stroma composed of stromal cells without an accompanying epithelial component. Can be benign or locally aggressive. | Arise from interlobular connective tissue. Fibromatosis can be associated with prior trauma or surgery. | Myofibroblastoma is equally common in males. Fibromatosis can be part of familial syndromes (e.g., FAP, Gardner syndrome). | Fibromatosis is a clonal proliferation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. | - | Fibromatosis presents as an irregular, infiltrating mass that can involve muscle. Lipomas are fat-containing lesions. | **Myofibroblastoma:** Consists of myofibroblasts. **Lipoma:** Consists of mature adipose tissue. **Fibromatosis:** Consists of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. | Palpable masses. | - | **Benign:** Lipoma, Myofibroblastoma **Locally Aggressive:** Fibromatosis | Fibromatosis is locally aggressive and can involve muscle but does not metastasize. | - |
| **Malignant Tumors of Interlobular Stroma** Rare sarcomas arising from interlobular stroma. The most frequent is angiosarcoma. | Can be sporadic or a complication of therapy (radiation, chronic lymphedema). | **Sporadic Angiosarcoma:** Young women (mean age 35). **Therapy-related Angiosarcoma:** Older women, post-treatment for breast cancer (radiation). | Therapy-related angiosarcomas arise 5 to 10 years after radiation therapy. | - | - | - | Sporadic angiosarcomas arise in the breast parenchyma. Therapy-related angiosarcomas typically arise in the skin of the breast. | - | **Angiosarcoma** (most common). Others are extremely rare. | Sporadic angiosarcomas have a poor prognosis. | - |
| **Inflammatory Carcinoma (sign: Peau d'Orange)** A clinical presentation of breast cancer caused by extensive plugging of dermal lymphatics by tumor cells, leading to edematous skin resembling an orange peel (**peau d'orange**). | Underlying invasive carcinoma, usually diffusely infiltrative and of high grade. | 1% to 5% of breast cancers. Incidence is higher in women of African descent and younger women. | Extensive invasion and obstruction of the dermal lymphovascular spaces by carcinoma cells. This blocks lymphatic drainage, causing lymphedema and skin thickening. The skin is tethered by Cooper ligaments, creating the dimpled appearance. | - | The underlying carcinoma is usually diffusely infiltrative and does not typically form a discrete palpable mass. The breast is swollen and erythematous. | The histologic hallmark is the presence of tumor cell emboli within the dermal lymphovascular spaces. Typically, no inflammation is present despite the name. | Presents as breast erythema, swelling, and skin thickening. The skin mimics the surface of an orange peel, an appearance referred to as **peau d'orange**. The presentation can be confused with a breast infection, leading to delayed diagnosis. | - | This is a clinical-pathologic entity, not a specific histologic or molecular subtype, though tumors are usually high grade. | Carries a very poor prognosis. Most patients have distant metastases at the time of diagnosis. The 3-year survival rate is only 3% to 10%. | - |
| **Paget Disease of the Nipple** A rare manifestation of breast cancer (1-4% of cases) characterized by the extension of malignant cells from an underlying ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) into the epidermis of the nipple. | Extension of an underlying DCIS through the lactiferous sinuses into the nipple skin. | Presence of an underlying breast carcinoma. | Malignant cells (**Paget cells**) from DCIS migrate up the ductal system into the nipple skin without crossing the basement membrane. The cells disrupt the normal epithelial barrier, allowing extracellular fluid to seep out, forming a crust. | The underlying carcinoma is usually ER-negative and overexpresses **HER2**. | - | Presence of malignant, intraepidermal adenocarcinoma cells (**Paget cells**) occurring singly or in small clusters within the epidermis of the nipple. These cells are readily detected by nipple biopsy or cytologic preparations of the exudate. | Presents as a unilateral erythematous eruption on the nipple with a scale crust. Pruritus is common. The lesion may be mistaken for eczema. A palpable mass is present in 50-60% of women, which is almost always invasive carcinoma. | - | - | Prognosis depends entirely on the features (grade, invasiveness) of the underlying carcinoma and is not affected by the presence or absence of Paget disease itself. | - |
| **Acute Mastitis** An acute bacterial infection of the breast tissue. | Caused by a local bacterial infection, most commonly **Staphylococcus aureus**, or less commonly, streptococci. | Typically occurs during the first month of breastfeeding (lactation). Cracks and fissures in the nipples provide a portal of entry. | Bacteria invade the breast tissue from a portal of entry in the nipple. Initially involves one duct system, but can spread. Staphylococci often lead to abscess formation, while streptococci cause spreading infection (cellulitis). | - | Breast is erythematous and swollen. Abscesses may form. | - | Painful, erythematous breast. Fever is often present. | - | - | Can lead to single or multiple abscesses. Spread of infection to the entire breast (cellulitis). | Appropriate antibiotics and continued expression of milk from the breast. Surgical drainage may be required for abscesses. |
| **Gynecomastia** Enlargement of the male breast. It is the only benign lesion seen with any frequency in the male breast. | An imbalance between estrogens (which stimulate breast tissue) and androgens (which counteract these effects). | Puberty, old age, **cirrhosis of the liver** (causes hyperestrinism), drugs (alcohol, marijuana, heroin, antiretroviral therapy, anabolic steroids), **Klinefelter syndrome (XXY karyotype)**. | Excess estrogen relative to androgens stimulates hyperplasia of the ductal epithelium and an increase in stromal connective tissue. | - | Presents as a button-like subareolar enlargement, which may be unilateral or bilateral. | Increase in dense, collagenous connective tissue associated with epithelial hyperplasia of the duct lining. **Lobule formation is almost never observed**. | A subareolar enlargement in the male breast. | - | - | Rarely associated with functioning testicular neoplasms such as **Leydig cell or Sertoli cell tumors**. | - |
| **Fibrocystic Changes of the Breast (Nonproliferative Breast Changes)** Common morphologic alterations including cysts, fibrosis, and adenosis, grouped under this term. They are not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. | - | - | Small cysts form by the dilation of lobules. Cysts may rupture, releasing material into the stroma, leading to chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Adenosis is an increase in the number of acini per lobule. | - | Cysts contain turbid, semitranslucent brown- or blue-colored fluid, known as **blue-dome cysts**. Fibrosis contributes to the palpable nodularity of the breast. | 1. **Cysts:** Lined either by a flattened atrophic epithelium or by **metaplastic apocrine cells** (abundant granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm). Calcifications are common. 2. **Fibrosis:** Increased fibrous stroma with chronic inflammation. 3. **Adenosis:** An increased number of acini per lobule. | May present as "lumpy bumpy" breasts on palpation, or a dense breast with cysts on mammography. May present as a solitary, firm, palpable mass (a cyst). | Diagnosis of a cyst is confirmed by its disappearance after fine-needle aspiration of its contents. | Three principal morphologic changes: 1. **Cystic change** (often with apocrine metaplasia) 2. **Fibrosis** 3. **Adenosis** | Not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. | - |
