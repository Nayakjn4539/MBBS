# [[Aneurysmal Bone Cyst]]

### Introduction
An [[Aneurysmal Bone Cyst]] (ABC) is a benign, expansile, osteolytic bone lesion characterized by blood-filled spaces separated by connective tissue septa containing bone or osteoid tissue and osteoclast giant cells. Despite the name, it is not a true neoplasm or a true cyst (as it lacks an epithelial lining), but rather a tumor-like condition or hamartoma.

### Epidemiology
*   **Age:** Predominantly affects children and adolescents, typically in the **10–20 years** age group.
*   **Sex:** Slight female preponderance or equal distribution.
*   **Incidence:** Accounts for approximately 6% of primary bone tumors.

### Etiology and Pathogenesis
ABCs can arise *de novo* or secondary to other pathologies.
1.  **Primary ABC:** Arises spontaneously. The pathophysiology is believed to be a local circulatory disturbance, such as venous obstruction or an arteriovenous fistula. This leads to increased intraosseous pressure, hemorrhage, and bone resorption.
2.  **Secondary ABC:** Occurs in association with other benign or malignant bone lesions. Common precursor lesions include:
    *   [[Giant Cell Tumor]] (GCT)
    *   [[Chondroblastoma]]
    *   [[Osteoblastoma]]
    *   [[Fibrous Dysplasia]]
    *   [[Non-ossifying Fibroma]]

### Pathology
#### Gross Appearance
*   **Appearance:** When opened, the lesion resembles a **"blood-filled sponge"**.
*   **Content:** Contains unclotted venous blood under pressure.
*   **Structure:** It is a cavernous honeycomb of vascular spaces separated by fibrous septa.

#### Histology
*   **Cystic Spaces:** Blood-filled channels of varying sizes.
*   **Lining:** **No endothelial lining** is present (distinguishing it from [[Hemangioma]]).
*   **Septa:** Fibrous tissue septa contain:
    *   Spindle cells (fibroblasts).
    *   Osteoid and woven bone.
    *   Multinucleated **[[Giant Cells]]** (Osteoclasts).

### Anatomical Location
*   **Region:** Typically located in the **[[Metaphysis]]** of long bones.
*   **Common Sites:**
    *   Distal Femur.
    *   Proximal Tibia (around the knee).
    *   Proximal Humerus.
    *   **Spine:** Posterior elements (neural arch/pedicles) are a characteristic site.

### Clinical Features
*   **Pain:** The most common symptom; usually insidious but increases with expansion.
*   **Swelling:** Often rapid growth over weeks to months due to the "aneurysmal" or "blow-out" expansion.
*   **History:** A history of mild trauma is often elicited.
*   **Spinal Symptoms:** If the vertebra is involved, it may cause compression of the [[Spinal Cord]] or nerve roots, leading to neurological deficits or paraparesis.
*   **[[Pathological Fracture]]:** May be the initial presentation.

### Diagnostic Imaging
#### 1. Plain X-ray
*   **Location:** **Eccentric**, metaphyseal lesion.
*   **Appearance:** Lytic, expansile lesion that "balloons" the cortex.
*   **Cortex:** The cortex is thinned out to an eggshell thickness but usually remains intact (unless fractured).
*   **Internal Structure:** Fine bony septa create a trabeculated or **"Soap Bubble"** appearance.
*   **Differential Feature:** Unlike GCT, the ABC usually stays in the metaphysis and does not extend all the way to the subchondral bone plate (articular surface).

#### 2. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
*   **Hallmark Sign:** **[[Fluid-Fluid Levels]]**.
    *   This occurs as blood components of different densities separate within the loculated spaces when the patient is immobile.
    *   While highly suggestive, it is not pathognomonic (also seen in Telangiectatic Osteosarcoma).

#### 3. CT Scan
*   Used to define the extent of cortical destruction and internal septation.

### Differential Diagnosis
The primary differential diagnoses include other cystic and giant-cell-rich lesions.

| Feature | [[Simple Bone Cyst]] (SBC) | [[Aneurysmal Bone Cyst]] (ABC) | [[Giant Cell Tumor]] (GCT) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Age** | < 20 years | 10–20 years | 20–40 years |
| **Location** | Centric, Metaphyseal | Eccentric, Metaphyseal | Eccentric, Epiphyseal |
| **Expansion** | Minimal (width < growth plate) | Marked "Ballooning" | Expansile |
| **Growth Plate** | Usually abuts plate | Usually abuts plate | Extends to articular surface |
| **Content** | Clear/Straw fluid | Blood | Solid fleshy tumor |
| **Imaging** | "Fallen Leaf" sign | "Soap Bubble" / Fluid levels | "Soap Bubble" |

### Treatment
The goal is to eradicate the lesion while preserving bone integrity.

1.  **Curettage and Bone Grafting:**
    *   The standard surgical treatment.
    *   Involves thorough scraping of the cyst wall followed by packing with bone chips (autograft or allograft).
2.  **Extended Curettage:**
    *   Use of adjuvants like liquid nitrogen, phenol, or a high-speed burr to destroy microscopic disease and reduce recurrence.
3.  **Sclerotherapy:**
    *   Percutaneous injection of fibrosing agents (e.g., Ethibloc, Polidocanol) into the cyst to induce healing.
4.  **Arterial Embolization:**
    *   Used for surgically difficult locations (e.g., large spinal or pelvic lesions) to reduce vascularity before surgery or as a primary treatment.
5.  **Excision:**
    *   Reserved for expendable bones (e.g., fibula, rib).

**Clinical Implication:** Recurrence is common (approximately 20–25%) after simple curettage. Continuous monitoring is required.
