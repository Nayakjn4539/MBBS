# Cohort Studies: Timing vs. Direction

While [[Cohort Studies]] are frequently associated with following people into the future, the defining characteristic of a cohort study is not the calendar time, but the **Direction of Inquiry**. 

**The Golden Rule:** A Cohort Study **ALWAYS** proceeds from **Cause $\rightarrow$ Effect** (Exposure $\rightarrow$ Outcome).

Depending on the temporal relationship between the initiation of the study and the occurrence of the disease, Cohort studies are classified into three types:

### 1. Prospective Cohort Study
*(Also known as: Current Cohort, Concurrent Cohort, Longitudinal study)*

*   **Timeline:** The outcome (disease) has **not yet occurred** when the study begins.
*   **Process:** The investigator identifies the population, documents exposure in the present, and follows them into the future to see who develops the disease.
*   **Example:** [[Framingham Heart Study]] (started in 1948 to observe development of CVD).

### 2. Retrospective Cohort Study
*(Also known as: Historical Cohort, Non-concurrent Cohort, Prospective study in retrospect)*

*   **Timeline:** Both the **exposure AND the outcome have already occurred** before the investigator starts the study.
*   **Process:** The investigator goes **back in time** (using existing records like employment history or medical files) to identify a group based on their *past exposure*. They then trace these people forward through time (using records) to determine if they developed the disease.
*   **Crucial Distinction:** Even though it looks at the past, it is **NOT** a [[Case-Control Study]]. In Case-Control, you start with the disease (Effect $\rightarrow$ Cause). In Retrospective Cohort, you define the group by their past exposure and trace them forward to the outcome (Cause $\rightarrow$ Effect).
*   **Advantages:** Economical and produces results quickly (no waiting for years for disease to develop).

*(Draw a timeline. Point "A" is Past, "B" is Present, "C" is Future.
**Retrospective:** Study starts at B, looks at exposure at A, traces to outcome at B.
**Prospective:** Study starts at B, looks at exposure at B, traces to outcome at C.
**Mixed:** Study starts at B, looks at exposure at A, traces to outcome at C.)*

### 3. Mixed (Ambispective) Cohort Study
*(Also known as: Combined Prospective-Retrospective Cohort)*

*   **Timeline:** Elements of both. Both exposure and outcome have occurred when the study begins, but the cohort is followed further into the future.
*   **Process:** The cohort is identified from past records (Retrospective phase) and assessed for outcomes to date. The *same* cohort is then followed up prospectively for new outcomes.
*   **Example:** Studies on radiation effects where immediate effects are studied from records, and long-term effects (like leukemia) are monitored in the future.

### Comparative Analysis of Analytical Studies

| Feature | Prospective Cohort | Retrospective Cohort | Case-Control |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Direction** | Forward (Cause $\rightarrow$ Effect) | Forward (Cause $\rightarrow$ Effect) | Backward (Effect $\rightarrow$ Cause) |
| **Start Point** | Exposure (Outcome has not happened) | Exposure (Outcome has already happened) | Disease (Outcome has happened) |
| **Data Source** | New data collection | Past records | Interviews/Records |
| **Time/Cost** | Expensive, Time-consuming | Economical, Quick | Inexpensive, Rapid |
| **Bias Risk** | Attrition Bias | Selection Bias, Information Bias | Recall Bias |
| **Synonyms** | Concurrent | Historical, Non-concurrent | **[[TROHOC]]** (Cohort spelled backwards) |

### Clinical Relevance
**Why choose Retrospective over Prospective?**
If you want to study the link between **asbestos exposure** and lung cancer today:
1.  **Prospective:** You would have to wait 20–30 years for cancer to develop. Unethical and slow.
2.  **Retrospective:** You access factory employment records from 1990 (exposure), and check death registries/hospital records up to 2024 (outcome). You get the answer *now*. This is why Retrospective Cohorts are vital for **Occupational Epidemiology**.

### Mnemonics

**To remember the Synonyms of Retrospective Cohort:**
**"Hi, No Pro-blems!"**
*   **Hi** = **Hi**storical Cohort
*   **No** = **No**n-concurrent Cohort
*   **Pro** = **Pro**spective in retrospect

**To distinguish Case-Control vs. Retrospective Cohort:**
*"In Case-Control, you hunt for the **History** (ask about past).*
*In Retrospective Cohort, you hunt through the **Files** (past records define the group)."*
