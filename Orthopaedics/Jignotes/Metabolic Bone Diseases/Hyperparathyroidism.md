# Hyperparathyroidism and Brown Tumors

### Introduction
[[Hyperparathyroidism]] is a metabolic disorder characterized by excessive secretion of [[parathyroid hormone]] (PTH). This hormonal imbalance leads to increased bone turnover and hypercalcemia. [[Brown tumors]] are a specific, focal skeletal manifestation of severe, untreated hyperparathyroidism, representing a reparative cellular process rather than a true neoplasm.

### Classification and Etiology

Hyperparathyroidism is classified based on the underlying cause:

| Type | Etiology | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary** | Usually a solitary **adenoma** (80-85%) of the [[parathyroid gland]]. Less commonly hyperplasia or carcinoma. | Autonomous secretion of PTH. High Serum Ca, High PTH. |
| **Secondary** | Physiological compensatory hypertrophy due to persistent [[hypocalcemia]]. Common in **Chronic Renal Failure** (Renal Rickets) or Malabsorption. | High PTH, Low/Normal Serum Ca, High Phosphate (in renal failure). |
| **Tertiary** | Autonomous hypersecretion following long-standing secondary hyperparathyroidism. | Hyperplasia becomes autonomous. High Serum Ca, Very High PTH. |

### Pathophysiology of Brown Tumors

**Brown tumors** (Osteitis Fibrosa Cystica) are localized areas of rapid bone loss. 
*   **Mechanism:** Excess [[PTH]] stimulates [[osteoclasts]], leading to intense bone resorption.
*   **Formation:** The rapid bone destruction creates cavities within the bone. These cavities fill with vascular fibrous tissue, giant cells, and blood.
*   **Color:** The characteristic **brown coloration** is due to hemorrhage within the lesion, leading to the deposition of **hemosiderin** (breakdown product of hemoglobin).
*   **Histology:** It mimics a [[Giant Cell Tumor]] (GCT) with numerous multinucleated giant cells in a spindle cell stroma. Hence, it is a crucial differential diagnosis for GCT.

### Clinical Features

Hyperparathyroidism typically affects the middle-aged population (40–65 years), with women affected more frequently than men (3:1 ratio). Many patients are asymptomatic (diagnosed via routine biochemistry). Symptomatic presentation is classically described by the mnemonic:

**Mnemonic: "Bones, Stones, Groans, and Psychic Moans"**

1.  **Bones (Skeletal):**
    *   Generalized bone pain and tenderness.
    *   **[[Brown Tumors]]:** Present as lytic, expansile lesions that may cause pathological fractures. Common sites include the jaw (mandible/maxilla), long bones, pelvis, and ribs.
    *   **[[Osteitis Fibrosa Cystica]]:** Severe form involving marrow fibrosis and cystic spaces.
    *   Deformities (e.g., kyphosis due to vertebral collapse).

2.  **Stones (Renal):**
    *   [[Nephrolithiasis]] (kidney stones).
    *   [[Nephrocalcinosis]] (deposition of calcium in kidney parenchyma).
    *   Polyuria and polydipsia.

3.  **Groans (Abdominal):**
    *   Anorexia, nausea, vomiting.
    *   Constipation.
    *   Peptic ulcers (increased gastrin) and Pancreatitis.

4.  **Psychic Moans (Neuromuscular/Psychiatric):**
    *   Depression, fatigue, lethargy.
    *   Muscle weakness and hypotonia.

### Radiological Features

Radiographic changes are diagnostic and affect multiple sites.

1.  **Hand (Pathognomonic):**
    *   **Subperiosteal resorption:** Seen along the **radial aspect** of the middle phalanges. This is the most specific sign.
    *   Terminal tuft erosion (acro-osteolysis).

2.  **Skull:**
    *   **"Pepper Pot Skull"** or **"Salt and Pepper"** appearance: Due to granular deossification (loss of trabeculae).
    *   Loss of **[[lamina dura]]** around the teeth.

3.  **Spine:**
    *   **"Codfish Spine":** Biconcave vertebral bodies due to disc pressure on softened bone (osteopenia).
    *   **"Rugger Jersey Spine":** Seen in **Secondary Hyperparathyroidism** (Renal Osteodystrophy). Sclerosis of the upper and lower endplates with a radiolucent center.

4.  **Long Bones:**
    *   **[[Brown Tumors]]:** Appear as well-defined, lytic, cystic lesions. They can be eccentric or central and may expand the cortex. They essentially look like "holes" in the bone.
    *   Generalized [[osteoporosis]] or osteopenia.
    *   Cortical thinning and endosteal cavitation.

### Laboratory Investigations

Biochemical profiling is essential for diagnosis and differentiating the types.

| Parameter | Primary Hyperparathyroidism | Secondary Hyperparathyroidism (Renal) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Serum Calcium** | **High** (Hypercalcemia) | **Low** or Normal |
| **Serum Phosphate** | **Low** (Hypophosphatemia) | **High** (Hyperphosphatemia) |
| **ALP** | **High** (Increased bone turnover) | **High** |
| **Serum PTH** | **High** | **High** |
| **Urine Calcium** | High (Hypercalciuria) | Low |

### Differential Diagnosis

Brown tumors on X-ray can mimic other lytic bone lesions. A helpful mnemonic for lytic lesions with giant cells is **BLUNACH**:

*   **B** - [[Brown Tumor]]
*   **L** - [[Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis]] (Eosinophilic Granuloma)
*   **U** - [[Unicameral Bone Cyst]] (Simple Bone Cyst)
*   **N** - [[Non-ossifying Fibroma]]
*   **A** - [[Aneurysmal Bone Cyst]] (ABC)
*   **C** - [[Chondroblastoma]]
*   **H** - [[Giant Cell Tumor]] (Osteoclastoma) / Hyperparathyroidism

### Treatment

**1. Conservative Management:**
*   Hydration to manage hypercalcemia.
*   Low calcium diet.
*   Medical management of secondary causes (e.g., Phosphate binders, Vitamin D for renal failure).

**2. Surgical Management:**
*   **[[Parathyroidectomy]]:** Removal of the adenoma is the definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism.
    *   **Effect on Brown Tumors:** Following parathyroidectomy, Brown tumors usually regress spontaneously and undergo ossification (fill in with bone). They rarely require separate surgical excision unless they cause significant deformity or threaten fracture.
*   **Prophylactic Fixation:** Required if a Brown tumor causes a pathological fracture or imminent structural failure.

### Clinical Implications

**[[Hungry Bone Syndrome]]:**
*   Post-parathyroidectomy, the sudden drop in PTH stops bone resorption, but bone formation (by osteoblasts) continues rapidly.
*   The "starved" bones rapidly uptake calcium and phosphate from the blood for remineralization.
*   **Result:** Severe, acute **hypocalcemia** leading to tetany.
*   **Management:** aggressive calcium and Vitamin D supplementation.
