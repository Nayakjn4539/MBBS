# Septoplasty

### Definition
**[[Septoplasty]]** is a conservative surgical procedure performed to correct a [[deviated nasal septum]] (DNS). The primary principle is to retain as much of the septal framework (cartilage and bone) as possible, removing only the most deviated parts and repositioning the rest. It has largely replaced the more radical [[Submucous Resection]] (SMR) operation.

### Indications
The surgery is indicated when the deviated septum causes functional impairment or obstructs access for other procedures:

*   **Nasal Obstruction:** Unilateral or bilateral obstruction causing mouth breathing or sleep apnea.
*   **Recurrent [[Rhinosinusitis]]:** When deviation obstructs sinus ventilation and drainage.
*   **Recurrent [[Epistaxis]]:** Usually from a septal spur causing mucosal drying and crusting.
*   **Headache:** Septal contact points with the lateral nasal wall (Sluder's neuralgia).
*   **Surgical Access:**
    *   To access the middle meatus/frontal recess in [[Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery]] (FESS).
    *   Trans-septal approach for [[Hypophysectomy]] (pituitary surgery) or Vidian neurectomy.
    *   Endoscopic [[Dacryocystorhinostomy]] (DCR).
*   **Cosmetic:** As part of [[Septorhinoplasty]] to correct external nasal deformities.
*   **Graft Harvesting:** To obtain septal cartilage for rhinoplasty or tympanoplasty.

### Contraindications
*   **Absolute:** Acute nasal or sinus infection, untreated coagulation disorders (bleeding diathesis).
*   **Relative/Age Factor:** Generally avoided in children below 17 years as it may interfere with the growth of the nasal skeleton (secondary ossification centers). However, conservative septoplasty is performed in children if severe obstruction exists.
*   **Medical:** Uncontrolled diabetes or hypertension.

### Preoperative Assessment
*   **Diagnostic Nasal Endoscopy:** To assess the exact pathology, spur location, and associated turbinate hypertrophy.
*   **[[Cottle's Test]]:** Used to assess nasal valve patency. The cheek is pulled laterally to open the nasal valve; if obstruction improves, it indicates valve area abnormality which may be corrected by septoplasty/rhinoplasty.
*   **Imaging:** CT scan is standard for ESS planning but not mandatory for simple septoplasty unless sinus disease is suspected.

### Anesthesia and Position
*   **Anesthesia:** Local anesthesia (with sedation) or General Anesthesia.
    *   Infiltration: 2% [[Lignocaine]] with 1:100,000 [[Adrenaline]] is injected into the subperichondrial/subperiosteal planes to provide hemostasis and hydro-dissection.
*   **Position:** Supine with the head end raised (reclining position) to reduce venous engorgement.

### Surgical Steps

> Steps of Septoplasty including incision, flap elevation, and scoring of cartilage

1.  **Incision:**
    *   **Freer’s (Hemitransfixion) Incision:** Made at the caudal (lower) border of the septal cartilage. This is the standard for septoplasty.
    *   **Killian’s Incision:** Made 5 mm cephalic (above) to the caudal border. Used mainly for SMR but limits access to caudal deviations.
2.  **Flap Elevation:** A [[mucoperichondrial flap]] is raised usually on **one side** (typically the concave side). Access to the opposite side is achieved by separating the cartilage from the vomer and ethmoid plate.
3.  **Disarticulation:** The septal cartilage is separated from the [[vomer]], perpendicular plate of the [[ethmoid]], and the maxillary crest.
4.  **Correction of Deformity:**
    *   **Maxillary Crest:** Removed or fractured to realign cartilage.
    *   **Bony Septum:** Deviated parts of the perpendicular plate of ethmoid or vomer are removed with Luc's forceps or gouge.
    *   **Cartilaginous Septum:** Corrected by conservative methods:
        *   *Scoring/Cross-hatching:* Incisions on the concave side to break cartilage spring (interlocked stress).
        *   *Shaving:* Thinning the convex side.
        *   *Wedge resection:* Removing a small strip to straighten the deviation.
5.  **Stabilization:** The corrected septum is repositioned.
6.  **Closure:** Trans-septal quilting sutures are placed to approximate flaps and prevent hematoma.
7.  **Packing:** Anterior nasal packing or septal splints (silastic sheets) are inserted to provide support and prevent synechiae.

### Endoscopic Septoplasty
A modern modification using a nasal endoscope.
*   **Advantages:** Better illumination, precise identification of pathology (e.g., contact points, spurs), limited incision (often horizontal over the spur), and minimal flap elevation. Ideal for isolated spurs or posterior deviations.
*   **Technique:** Infiltration and incision are similar, but visualization is via a 0-degree endoscope.

### Differences: Septoplasty vs. SMR (Submucous Resection)
This comparison is critical for exams.

| Feature | Septoplasty | Submucous Resection (SMR) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Principle** | Conservative (Tissue sparing) | Radical (Resective) |
| **Flap Elevation** | Usually **One side** (Unilateral) | **Both sides** (Bilateral) |
| **Incision** | Freer’s (Hemitransfixion) | Killian’s |
| **Cartilage Removal** | Minimal (only most deviated part) | Extensive (Large window removed) |
| **Framework Retained** | Maximum | Only L-strut (1 cm dorsal/caudal) preserved |
| **Age Group** | Can be done in children | Contraindicated in children (<17 yrs) |
| **Complications** | Fewer (perforation/saddling rare) | Higher risk of perforation/saddling |
| **Revision Surgery** | Easier | Difficult (due to fibrosis/lack of cartilage) |
| **Combination** | Easily combined with [[Rhinoplasty]] | Difficult to combine with Rhinoplasty |

### Postoperative Care
*   Antibiotics and analgesics.
*   Nasal pack removal after 24 hours.
*   Nasal splints removed after 5–7 days.
*   Saline nasal douching to remove crusts.
*   Avoid nose blowing for 2–3 weeks.

### Complications

**Immediate:**
1.  **Hemorrhage:** Primary or reactionary.
2.  **[[Septal Hematoma]]:** Collection of blood between flaps. Must be drained immediately to prevent abscess/necrosis.
3.  **CSF Rhinorrhea:** Rare, due to injury to the cribriform plate while manipulating the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid.

**Delayed:**
1.  **[[Septal Perforation]]:** Due to bilateral mucosal tears at corresponding points or necrosis.
2.  **Saddle Nose Deformity:** Depression of the nasal dorsum due to over-resection of the dorsal cartilage strip or septal abscess.
3.  **Columellar Retraction:** Due to removal of the caudal septal strip.
4.  **[[Septal Abscess]]:** Secondary to infected hematoma.
5.  **Toxic Shock Syndrome:** Rare, associated with staphylococcal infection from packing.
6.  **Nasal Synechia:** Adhesions between the septum and lateral wall.
7.  **Persistence of Deviation:** Due to inadequate correction.

**Clinical Implication:** In SMR, a strip of cartilage (L-strut) 1 cm wide along the dorsal and caudal border must be preserved to prevent sinking of the nasal bridge ([[Saddle nose]]) and retraction of the columella.
