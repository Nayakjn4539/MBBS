# Man-made Malaria

### Definition
**[[Man-made malaria]]** refers to the incidence of malaria that occurs consequently to human undertakings and developmental activities. These activities disturb the ecosystem and create favorable conditions for the breeding of **[[mosquito vectors]]** and the spread of the parasite,.

### Etiology and Breeding Sites
The primary cause is the creation of artificial collections of water due to engineering and developmental projects.

*   **Engineering Projects:** Construction of **[[hydroelectric dams]]**, roads, bridges, and railways often leaves behind excavations that fill with water,.
*   **Burrow Pits:** Created when earth is dug out for construction purposes; these collect rainwater and become breeding grounds,.
*   **Irrigation:** Defective irrigation channels and seepage from canals lead to water stagnation.
*   **Urbanization:** Rapid, unplanned urbanization leads to **[[Urban Malaria]]**, primarily driven by poor water management and storage practices.
    *   *Common Sites:* Overhead tanks, underground reservoirs, water coolers, flower vases, broken bottles, and discarded tyres.

### Vectors Involved
The specific vector depends on the location (Urban vs. Rural projects):

| Vector Species | Habitat/Context | Breeding Preference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Anopheles stephensi]]** | **Urban Areas** | Wells, cisterns, overhead tanks, fountains, artificial containers,. |
| **[[Anopheles culicifacies]]** | **Rural/Project Areas** | Irrigation channels, burrow pits, rainwater pools,. |

### Clinical and Epidemiological Relevance
*   **Tropical Aggregation of Labor:** In large project areas (e.g., dam construction), laborers from different regions aggregate. This brings together **[[malaria parasites]]** (different strains) and **non-immune populations**, leading to explosive outbreaks.
*   **Resistance:** Vectors in these areas often develop resistance due to agricultural pesticide use or inadequate control measures.
*   **High Endemicity:** These "project areas" often contribute a disproportionately large number of cases relative to their population size.

### Mnemonic
To remember the sources of Man-made Malaria, think of the **"SITE"**:

*   **S** - **S**torage containers (Overhead tanks, coolers)
*   **I** - **I**rrigation channels (Defective/seeping)
*   **T** - **T**ropical aggregation of labor (Project areas)
*   **E** - **E**xcavations (Burrow pits for roads/dams)

### Prevention and Control
Control of man-made malaria requires an **[[Integrated Vector Management]]** approach, specifically targeting **[[Source Reduction]]**.

1.  **Engineering Measures:**
    *   Filling and levelling of burrow pits and ditches,.
    *   Proper maintenance of irrigation channels to prevent seepage.
    *   **[[Mosquito proofing]]** of overhead tanks and wells (lids should be airtight).

2.  **Legislative Measures:**
    *   Enforcement of **[[Model Civic Bye-laws]]** in urban areas to penalize the creation of mosquitogenic conditions.
    *   Building bye-laws to ensure proper design (e.g., curing tanks at construction sites must be treated),.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Introduction of **[[Larvivorous fish]]** (e.g., *Gambusia affinis*, *Poecilia*) in ornamental tanks, fountains, and large water bodies where chemical control is not feasible,.

4.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   Use of larvicides like **[[Temephos]]** (Abate) in potable water containers.
    *   Biolarvicides like *Bacillus thuringiensis*.
