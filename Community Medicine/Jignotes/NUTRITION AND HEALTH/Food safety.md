### **Food Safety and Hygiene**

**Definition**
[[Food Safety]] or Food Hygiene is defined as "all conditions and measures that are necessary during the production, processing, storage, distribution, and preparation of food to ensure that it is safe, sound, wholesome, and fit for human consumption". The primary aim is to prevent **food poisoning** and **food-borne illnesses**.

### **1. Components of Food Hygiene**

#### **A. Milk Hygiene**
Milk is an efficient vehicle for a variety of disease agents. Sources of infection include the dairy animal, human handler, or the environment (contaminated vessels/water).

**Milk-borne Diseases:**
*   **Primary to Animals (Transmitted to man):** [[Tuberculosis]], [[Brucellosis]], Streptococcal infections, Salmonellosis, Q fever.
*   **Primary to Man (Transmitted via milk):** Typhoid, Cholera, Shigellosis, Diphtheria, Viral Hepatitis.

**Pasteurization of Milk:**
Heating milk to destroy pathogens while causing minimal changes in composition/flavor.

| Method | Temperature & Time | Remarks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Holder (Vat) Method** | 63–66°C for **30 mins**, then cooled to 5°C. | Recommended for rural/small communities. |
| **HTST Method** (High Temp Short Time) | 72°C for **15 seconds**, then cooled to 4°C. | Most widely used. |
| **UHT Method** (Ultra High Temp) | 125°C for a few seconds (2 stages). | Bottled quickly. |

**Tests for Pasteurized Milk:**
1.  **Phosphatase Test:** Most widely used. Phosphatase enzyme is destroyed at pasteurization temp. A positive test indicates inadequate pasteurization or addition of raw milk.
2.  **Standard Plate Count:** Limit is 30,000 bacterial count/ml.
3.  **Coliform Count:** Coliforms should be absent in 1 ml.

#### **B. Meat Hygiene**
*   **Meat Inspection:** Proper **ante-mortem** (before slaughter) and **post-mortem** inspection of animals is crucial to reject animals with diseases like anthrax, tuberculosis, or cysticercosis.
*   **Slaughter Houses:** Must have independent water supply, fly-proof storage, and proper waste disposal (blood/offal not discharged into public sewers).

#### **C. Sanitation of Eating Places**
*   **Location:** Away from open drains/manure pits.
*   **Kitchen:** Floor space minimum 60 sq. ft, window opening 25% of floor area, impervious floors.
*   **Storage:** Perishable and non-perishable items kept separately; temperature control is vital.

#### **D. Food Handlers**
Food handlers are potential sources of infection for typhoid, dysentery, viral hepatitis, and parasitic cysts.
*   **Medical Examination:** Complete check-up at employment; exclusion of those with skin infections, wounds, or otitis media.
*   **Personal Hygiene:** Clean hands (scrubbed with soap after toilet), trimmed nails, head coverings (especially females), and clean white overalls.

### **2. Food-borne Diseases**

Defined as diseases caused by agents entering the body through the ingestion of food.

**Classification of Food-borne Diseases:**

| Category | Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Food-borne Intoxications** | **Natural Toxins:** [[Lathyrism]], Endemic ascites.<br>**Bacterial Toxins:** [[Botulism]], Staphylococcal poisoning.<br>**Fungal Toxins:** [[Aflatoxin]], Ergot.<br>**Chemicals:** Heavy metals (Mercury, Lead), Pesticides. |
| **Food-borne Infections** | **Bacterial:** [[Typhoid]], Salmonellosis, Cholera, Shigellosis.<br>**Viral:** Hepatitis A, Hepatitis E, Rotavirus.<br>**Parasitic:** Taeniasis, Hydatidosis, Amoebiasis, Ascariasis. |

### **3. Food Toxicants**

Specific toxins causing public health problems in India:

| Disease | Toxin Agent | Source/Adulterant | Clinical Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Neurolathyrism]]** | **BOAA** (Beta-oxalyl-amino-alanine) | *Lathyrus sativus* (Khesari Dal) | Spastic paralysis of lower limbs (scissoring gait). |
| **[[Aflatoxicosis]]** | **Aflatoxin** | *Aspergillus flavus* (fungus on groundnut, maize) | Hepatotoxic, Carcinogenic (Liver cancer). |
| **[[Ergotism]]** | **Ergot Alkaloids** | *Claviceps purpurea* (fungus on Bajra/Rye) | Painful cramps, peripheral gangrene, nausea. |
| **[[Epidemic Dropsy]]** | **Sanguinarine** | *Argemone mexicana* oil mixed in Mustard oil | Pitting edema, glaucoma, cardiac failure. |
| **Endemic Ascites** | **Pyrrolizidine alkaloids** | *Crotalaria* seeds (Jhunjhunia) | Hepatotoxicity, Ascites. |

> **Mnemonic for Epidemic Dropsy:**
> **S**anguinarine causes **S**welling (Edema) and **S**ight loss (Glaucoma) from **S**arson (Mustard) oil adulteration.

### **4. Food Adulteration & Legislation**

**[[Food Adulteration]]:** Mixing, substitution, concealing quality, misbranding, or adding toxicants to food.

**Acts and Standards:**
1.  **[[Food Safety and Standards Act]] (FSSA), 2006:** Consolidates laws relating to food; established the **FSSAI** (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) to lay down science-based standards.
2.  **PFA Act (1954):** Prevention of Food Adulteration Act (older legislation).
3.  **Codex Alimentarius:** Joint FAO/WHO standards for the international market; Indian standards are based on this.
4.  **Agmark:** Voluntary standard for agricultural products.
5.  **ISI (BIS):** Certification by Bureau of Indian Standards for processed foods.

---

### **5. Food Fortification**

*   **Definition:** The process of adding nutrients to foods (in small quantities) to maintain or improve the quality of the diet of a group or community.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Iodization of Salt:** To prevent [[Endemic Goitre]]/IDD.
    *   **Vanaspati:** Fortified with Vitamin A and D.
    *   **Fluoridation of water:** To prevent dental caries.
    *   **Double Fortified Salt (DFS):** Fortified with Iron and Iodine.

### **Clinical Relevance**
*   **Botulism:** Suspect in patients with descending paralysis, diplopia, and dysphagia after eating home-canned foods (neurotoxin).
*   **Staphylococcal Poisoning:** Short incubation (1-6 hrs), severe vomiting, no fever. Associated with milk products/salads handled by infected workers.
*   **Salmonellosis:** Longer incubation (12-24 hrs), fever present, diarrhea. Associated with poultry/eggs.
