# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Blocked rat flea and it’s control measures

### **Blocked Rat Flea**

A **Blocked Rat Flea** is the critical biological vector mechanism responsible for the transmission of [[Bubonic Plague]]. It represents a specific pathological state of the flea (usually *Xenopsylla cheopis*) caused by the multiplication of the plague bacillus, [[Yersinia pestis]].

#### **Mechanism of Formation**
1.  **Ingestion:** The flea feeds on an infected rodent (reservoir), ingesting blood containing *Y. pestis*. A flea may ingest up to 0.5 cu. mm of blood, which can contain as many as **5,000 plague bacilli**.
2.  **Multiplication:** The bacilli multiply enormously in the gut of the flea.
3.  **Blockage:** The bacterial mass eventually blocks the **[[Proventriculus]]** (the valve between the esophagus and the stomach) so that no food can pass through to be digested.
4.  **Starvation and Biting:** The flea becomes "blocked" and faces starvation. Driven by hunger, it makes frantic efforts to bite and suck blood over and over again,.
5.  **Regurgitation:** Since the proventriculus is blocked, the blood cannot enter the stomach. instead, the flea regurgitates (vomits) the blood mixed with plague bacilli back into the bite wound of the new host.

#### **Clinical and Epidemiological Significance**
*   **Vector Efficiency:** *Xenopsylla cheopis* (Indian Rat Flea) is the most efficient vector due to this blocking mechanism.
*   **Partially Blocked Flea:** A *partially* blocked flea is epidemiologically **more dangerous** than a completely blocked flea. A completely blocked flea dies rapidly of starvation, whereas a partially blocked flea can live longer (up to a year), allowing it to bite and infect more people over a longer period,.
*   **Survival:** Infected fleas may survive in the microclimate of burrows for up to 4 years, maintaining the infection in natural foci,.

### **Control Measures for Rat Fleas**

The control of fleas is the **most effective method** to break the chain of transmission (Rodent $\rightarrow$ Flea $\rightarrow$ Man).

**<u>CRITICAL RULE:</u>** Anti-flea measures must **PRECEDE** or coincide with anti-rodent measures. If rodents are killed first, the hungry fleas leave the cold carcasses and attack humans, causing a severe outbreak.

#### **1. Insecticidal Control (Chemical Control)**
The destruction of rat fleas is achieved by the application of residual insecticides.
*   **First Line Insecticides:**
    *   **[[DDT]] (10% dust):** Used as the cheapest and most widely used formulation. Applied to floors and walls up to a height of 1 foot (30 cm),.
    *   **BHC (3% dust):** Used if DDT is not available or appropriate.
*   **In Case of Resistance:**
    *   If fleas are resistant to DDT/BHC, use **Carbaryl (2%)** or **Malathion (5%)**.
*   **Method of Application:**
    *   **Insufflation:** Insecticidal dust is blown into rat burrows using a dust blower (about 30g per burrow),.
    *   **Patch Dusting:** Powder is dusted over rat runs, under gunny bags, and other harborages.
    *   **Spraying:** Inside houses covering the entire floor area and walls up to 3 feet.

> **Mnemonic for Control Sequence:** **"F**irst **F**leas, **R**ats **R**emain" (Kill **F**leas first, let **R**ats remain until fleas are dead).

#### **2. Evaluation of Control (Flea Indices)**
The success of control measures is evaluated using flea indices. The target is that the **Flea Index should drop to zero** within 48 hours of insecticide application.
*   **[[Cheopis Index]]:** Average number of *X. cheopis* per rat. If this index is **> 1**, it indicates the potential explosiveness of a plague outbreak.
*   **Total Flea Index:** Average number of fleas of all species per rat.

#### **3. Personal Prophylaxis**
*   **Repellents:** Application of **Diethyltoluamide ([[DEET]])** or Benzyl benzoate to clothing or skin prevents flea bites.
*   **Protective Clothing:** High boots and gloves should be used by workers entering plague-infected areas.

#### **4. Fumigation**
*   Gases like **Cyanogas** (Calcium cyanide) are used to fumigate rat burrows.
*   **Mechanism:** It kills **both** the rats and the fleas effectively,.
