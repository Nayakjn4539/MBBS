# [[Nose]] > Proptosis

### **Definition and Terminology**

*   **[[Proptosis]]:** Defined as the forward displacement of the globe (eyeball) due to any disease process within or adjacent to the orbit (e.g., retrobulbar mass, sinonasal pathology).
*   **[[Exophthalmos]]:** Specifically refers to abnormal protrusion of the eye, typically reserved for dysthyroid eye disease (Graves' disease).
*   **[[Pseudoproptosis]]:** Apparent protrusion of the eyeball when it is actually normal in position. Causes include contralateral [[enophthalmos]] (e.g., blowout fracture), lid retraction, high [[myopia]], or facial asymmetry.

### **Anatomical Basis of Sinonasal Proptosis**
The orbit is closely related to the paranasal sinuses, separated only by thin bony partitions. Pathologies often breach these barriers to displace the eye:
*   **Superiorly:** [[Frontal sinus]].
*   **Inferiorly:** [[Maxillary sinus]].
*   **Medially:** [[Ethmoid sinus]] (separated by the thin [[Lamina Papyracea]]).
*   **Posteriorly:** [[Sphenoid sinus]].

The average orbital volume is 30 ml; an increase of just 4 ml can produce 6 mm of proptosis.

### **Etiology: Sinonasal Causes of Proptosis**

Sinonasal causes can be broadly classified using the mnemonic **VEIN** (Vascular, Endocrine, Inflammation/Infection, Neoplasm).

#### **1. Inflammatory and Infective Causes**
Infections originating in the sinuses are the most common cause of unilateral proptosis in children.

*   **Complications of [[Rhinosinusitis]]:**
    *   Bacterial infection spreads directly through bone (e.g., lamina papyracea) or via valveless thrombophlebitis veins.
    *   **Chandler's Classification** of orbital complications:
        1.  **Preseptal cellulitis:** Edema of eyelid, globe normal.
        2.  **Orbital cellulitis:** Chemosis, proptosis, restricted movement.
        3.  **Subperiosteal abscess:** Pus collection between periorbita and bone; causes non-axial proptosis.
        4.  **Orbital abscess:** Pus within orbital fat; severe proptosis and visual loss.
        5.  **[[Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis]]:** Bilateral involvement, cranial nerve palsies (III, IV, VI).
*   **[[Fungal Sinusitis]]:**
    *   **Allergic Fungal Sinusitis (AFS):** Can cause expansion of sinuses and proptosis without invasion.
    *   **Invasive Fungal Sinusitis:** e.g., [[Mucormycosis]] or [[Aspergillosis]]. Invades orbit vessels causing ischemic necrosis, ophthalmoplegia, and proptosis (often in immunocompromised/diabetics).
*   **[[Mucocele]]:**
    *   Cystic, slowly expanding lesion caused by obstruction of the sinus ostium.
    *   Most common in Frontal and Ethmoid sinuses.
    *   Causes displacement of the eye (See Table below).
*   **[[Pott's Puffy Tumor]]:** Osteomyelitis of the frontal bone with a subperiosteal abscess, often associated with intracranial spread.

#### **2. Neoplastic Causes (Tumors)**
Tumors can cause proptosis by direct extension or bony erosion.

*   **Benign Tumors:**
    *   **[[Osteoma]]:** Dense bony tumor, most common in Frontal/Ethmoid sinuses. Causes displacement of the globe.
    *   **[[Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma]] (JNA):** Occurs in adolescent males. Spreads through the inferior orbital fissure to cause proptosis.
        *   **Clinical Sign:** **Frog Face Deformity** (widening of the nasal bridge and proptosis).
    *   **[[Inverted Papilloma]]:** Can erode medial orbital wall.
    *   **Fibrous Dysplasia:** Replaces bone with fibrous tissue, causing facial disfigurement and eye displacement.
*   **Malignant Tumors:**
    *   **[[Squamous Cell Carcinoma]]:** Most common malignancy of maxillary/ethmoid sinuses invading the orbit.
    *   **[[Adenocarcinoma]]:** Common in woodworkers (Ethmoid origin).
    *   **[[Olfactory Neuroblastoma]]:** Arises from the roof of the nose, invading the orbit and cribriform plate.
    *   **Rhabdomyosarcoma:** Commonest soft tissue sarcoma in children.

### **Clinical Evaluation**

**1. History**
*   **Onset:** Acute (Infection/Inflammation) vs. Gradual (Mucocele/Tumor).
*   **Pain:** Suggests inflammation or infection; Malignancies are often painless until advanced.
*   **Visual Disturbances:** Diplopia or loss of vision suggests optic nerve compression or ophthalmoplegia.
*   **Nasal Symptoms:** Obstruction, epistaxis (JNA/Malignancy), rhinorrhea.

**2. Physical Examination**
*   **Direction of Displacement:** The direction the eye is pushed helps localize the sinus pathology.

| Sinus Origin | Direction of Proptosis/Displacement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Frontal Sinus]]** (e.g., Mucocele) | Downwards and Outwards (Lateral) |
| **[[Ethmoid Sinus]]** (e.g., Abscess/Tumor) | Laterally (Outwards) |
| **[[Maxillary Sinus]]** (e.g., Carcinoma) | Upwards |
| **[[Sphenoid Sinus]]** | Axial (Straight forward) |

*   **Palpation:**
    *   Check for compressibility (Hemangioma), pulsation (Neurofibromatosis/fistula), or reducibility (Encephalocele).
    *   **Egg-shell crackling:** Suggests thinning of bone over a mucocele.
*   **Nasal Endoscopy:** Essential to visualize masses, polyps, or pus in the meatus.

### **Differential Diagnosis: Orbital Cellulitis vs. Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis**

Distinguishing these two complications of sinusitis is critical.

| Feature | **[[Orbital Cellulitis]]** | **[[Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis]]** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Laterality** | Unilateral | Bilateral (usually starts unilateral, becomes bilateral) |
| **Onset** | Gradual | Abrupt/Rapid |
| **Proptosis** | Present | Present |
| **Cranial Nerves** | III, IV, VI involved due to orbital pressure | III, IV, VI involved (paralysis) |
| **Pupil** | Normal/Sluggish | Dilated and fixed |
| **Vision** | Decreased (late) | Decreased (early) |
| **Trigeminal Sensory Loss** | Absent | Present (V1/V2 paresthesia) |
| **Systemic Toxicity** | Moderate | Severe (toxemia) |

### **Investigations**

1.  **Imaging (Gold Standard):**
    *   **[[CT Scan]] (Contrast-enhanced):** Best for bony detail. Shows bone erosion, expansion (mucocele), and calcification.
        *   **Ring enhancement:** Suggests abscess.
        *   **"Delta Sign":** Seen in contrast CT/MRI for sinus thrombosis.
    *   **[[MRI]]:** Better for soft tissue delineation (e.g., fungal invasion, intracranial spread).
2.  **Biopsy:**
    *   Required for tumors. Endoscopic biopsy is preferred over external approaches to avoid breaching tumor margins.
    *   **Caution:** Do not biopsy vascular lesions (JNA) or suspected encephaloceles without imaging.
3.  **Nasal Smear/Culture:** For bacterial or fungal identification.

### **Management**

**Medical Management**
*   **Antibiotics:** IV broad-spectrum antibiotics for bacterial orbital cellulitis.
*   **Antifungals:** Amphotericin B and surgical debridement for invasive fungal sinusitis.
*   **Steroids:** Used in inflammatory pseudotumors or allergic fungal sinusitis (post-surgery).

**Surgical Management**
*   **Abscess Drainage:**
    *   **Endoscopic:** For medial subperiosteal abscess (via lamina papyracea).
    *   **External (Lynch-Howarth):** For superior/lateral abscesses not accessible endoscopically.
*   **Mucocele Drainage:** Endoscopic uncapping and marsupialization (drainage into the nasal cavity).
*   **Orbital Decompression:** Removing bony walls (medial/inferior) to create space, often for Graves' ophthalmopathy or severe proptosis risking the optic nerve.
*   **Tumor Resection:**
    *   **FESS:** For limited benign tumors (e.g., papilloma).
    *   **Maxillectomy/Craniofacial Resection:** For malignancies invading the orbit/skull base.

**Clinical Implication:**
A proptosis that is **painful** usually indicates **infection** (cellulitis/abscess) or inflammation (pseudotumor). A **painless** progressive proptosis is more suggestive of a **benign tumor** or **mucocele**.
