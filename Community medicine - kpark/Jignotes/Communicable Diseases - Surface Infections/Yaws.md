# Yaws (Endemic Treponematoses)

Yaws is a chronic, contagious, non-venereal infectious disease caused by a spirochete. It is also known as **Framboesia** (due to raspberry-like appearance of lesions), **Pian**, or **Bubas**. It primarily affects the skin, bone, and cartilage. Though not fatal, it causes considerable suffering, deformity, and disability.

### Epidemiological Determinants

**1. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** [[Treponema pallidum pertenue]].
*   It is morphologically and serologically indistinguishable from the syphilis spirochete (*T. pallidum*).
*   **Viability:** The organism dies rapidly outside tissues; sensitive to drying and heat.

**2. Reservoir of Infection**
*   **Natural Host:** [[Man]] is the *only* known reservoir.
*   There is **no animal reservoir**.
*   **Infective Material:** Exudates/secretions from early skin lesions. Late lesions are usually non-infectious.

**3. Host Factors**
*   **Age:** Primarily a disease of childhood and adolescence. >75% of cases occur before age 15.
*   **Immunity:** No natural immunity. Infection provides partial cross-immunity against venereal syphilis.

**4. Environmental Factors**
*   **Climate:** Endemic in warm, humid tropical regions (Rainfall >40 inches/year).
*   **Social:** Associated with poverty, overcrowding, poor personal hygiene, and scanty clothing.

### Transmission
*   **Direct Contact:** Skin-to-skin contact with infectious lesions (non-venereal).
*   **Entry:** Through abrasions or cuts on the skin.
*   **Fomites:** Indirect contact via contaminated mats or floors.
*   **Vectors:** Flies (e.g., *Hippelates*) can act as mechanical vectors.
*   **Risk of Human-to-Human Transmission:** High, especially among children playing together. Cases are contagious intermittently for several years.
*   **Note:** Intrauterine/congenital transmission does **not** occur.

### Incubation Period
*   **3 to 5 weeks** (Range 9–90 days).

### Clinical Picture
Yaws typically presents in two stages: Early and Late.

**1. Early Yaws**
*   **Primary Lesion:** Known as the [[Mother Yaw]]. It is an extra-genital painless papule (usually on legs/buttocks) that enlarges into a papilloma.
*   **Secondary Stage:** Occurs 6–8 weeks later. Generalized eruption of granulomatous, raspberry-like lesions (framboesia).
*   **Osteoperiostitis:** Painful swelling of bones (polydactylitis).

**2. Late Yaws (Tertiary)**
*   Appears usually 5 years after onset.
*   Destructive lesions of skin, bone, and periosteum.
*   **Characteristic deformities:**
    *   **[[Crab Yaws]]:** Hyperkeratosis of palms and soles causing painful fissures; makes the patient walk with a crab-like gait.
    *   **[[Gangosa]]:** Destructive ulceration of the nose, soft palate, and hard palate.
    *   **[[Goundu]]:** Osteoperiostitis causing swelling of the superior maxillary bone (paranasal swelling).

> **Mnemonic for Late Yaws:**
> **C**rab yaws (feet)
> **G**angosa (nose/palate)
> **G**oundu (maxilla)
> *Think: "The **Crab** walks with a **Gan**g to the **G**round."*

### Diagnosis
1.  **Clinical:** Diagnosis is primarily clinical in endemic areas (raspberry lesions).
2.  **Dark Field Microscopy:** Demonstration of *Treponema* in exudates from early lesions.
3.  **Serology:**
    *   Non-treponemal tests: VDRL, RPR.
    *   Treponemal tests: TPHA, FTA-ABS.
    *   *Note:* These tests cannot differentiate Yaws from Venereal Syphilis.

### Treatment
Yaws is highly responsive to antibiotics.

*   **Drug of Choice:** [[Benzathine Penicillin G]] (Single intramuscular injection).
    *   **Adults (≥10 years):** 1.2 million units.
    *   **Children (<10 years):** 0.6 million units.
*   **New Strategy (Morges Strategy):** Single dose oral [[Azithromycin]] (30 mg/kg, max 2g) is now recommended by WHO for eradication efforts.

### Eradication of Yaws
Yaws is considered an eradicable disease because:
1.  Man is the only reservoir.
2.  Transmission is direct and easy to interrupt.
3.  Diagnosis is easy (clinical).
4.  Treatment is cheap, effective (single dose), and renders the patient non-infectious rapidly.

#### WHO Treatment Policies for Eradication
The strategy depends on the prevalence of active yaws in the community:

| Prevalence of Active Yaws | Endemicity Status | Strategy Name | Action Taken |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **> 10%** | Hyper-endemic | **[[Total Mass Treatment]]** | Treat the **entire population** (cases + contacts). |
| **5 – 10%** | Meso-endemic | **[[Juvenile Mass Treatment]]** | Treat all cases + all children <15 years + obvious contacts. |
| **< 5%** | Hypo-endemic | **[[Selective Mass Treatment]]** | Treat only cases + household/obvious contacts. |

#### India's Success Story
*   India launched the **Yaws Eradication Programme (YEP)** in 1996.
*   Strategy used: Active case search, treatment of cases/contacts, and cessation of transmission.
*   **Status:** India was declared **free of Yaws** by WHO in May **2016**.

#### Current Global Strategy (Morges Strategy)
WHO aims for global eradication by 2020 (target updated periodically).
1.  **Total Community Treatment (TCT):** Treating the entire endemic community with oral Azithromycin.
2.  **Total Targeted Treatment (TTT):** Treating active cases and their contacts.
