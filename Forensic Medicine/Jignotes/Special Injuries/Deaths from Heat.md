# [[Special Injuries]] > Deaths from Heat

### **Deaths from Heat (Heat Stroke)**

Heat injuries occur when the body receives more heat than it can lose, leading to a failure of the thermal equilibrium. These are classified into three clinical syndromes based on severity: Heat Cramps, Heat Exhaustion, and [[Heat Stroke]].

### **Classification of Heat Syndromes**

| Feature | [[Heat Cramps]] (Miner's Cramps) | [[Heat Exhaustion]] (Heat Prostration/Collapse) | [[Heat Stroke]] (Sun Stroke/Thermic Fever) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pathophysiology** | Salt depletion due to sweating | Dehydration and salt depletion | Failure of [[thermoregulation]] center |
| **Mechanism** | Painful muscle spasms | Circulatory collapse | Hyperpyrexia + Multiorgan damage |
| **Body Temperature** | Normal | Normal or slightly elevated | **Very High** (>40.5°C / 105°F) |
| **CNS Status** | Normal | Dizziness, headache, anxiety | **Coma**, convulsions, delirium |
| **Sweating** | Profuse | Profuse (Skin: Moist/Clammy) | **Absent** (Skin: Hot/Dry) |
| **Prognosis** | Good | Good | **High Mortality** (Medical Emergency) |

### **[[Heat Stroke]]**

This is the most severe form of heat injury characterized by a body temperature greater than **41°C (106°F)** due to the failure of the heat-regulating mechanism in the [[hypothalamus]].

**Predisposing Factors:**
*   **Environmental:** High temperature, high humidity, lack of air movement.
*   **Personal:** Elderly, infants, obesity, heavy clothing, physical exertion.
*   **Medical:** Alcoholism, use of anticholinergics, diuretics, or phenothiazines (inhibit sweating).

#### **Clinical Features**
The **Classic Triad** of Heat Stroke:
1.  **Hyperpyrexia:** Rectal temperature > 106°F (41°C).
2.  **[[Anhidrosis]]:** Hot, dry, and flushed skin (sweating mechanism fails). *Note: In exertional heat stroke, sweating may persist.*
3.  **CNS Dysfunction:** Confusion, delirium, convulsions, and coma.

**Other Signs:**
*   **CVS:** Tachycardia, hypotension, shock.
*   **Respiratory:** Rapid, deep breathing (Kussmaul type).
*   **Pupils:** Constricted initially, dilated later.
*   **Renal:** Oliguria, protein and casts in urine (due to muscle necrosis/rhabdomyolysis).

### **Autopsy Findings**

Findings in heat stroke are generally non-specific (except for cerebellar changes). The diagnosis is largely based on the exclusion of other causes and circumstantial evidence.

#### **1. External Findings**
*   **[[Postmortem Caloricity]]:** The body remains warm for a longer duration after death (temperature may even rise postmortem).
*   **[[Rigor Mortis]]:** Appears very early and passes off quickly (due to accelerated metabolic changes).
*   **[[Decomposition]]:** Sets in very rapidly; putrefaction is accelerated.
*   **[[Postmortem Lividity]]:** Lividity is well developed and livid.
*   **Skin:** Usually dry and hot; cyanosis of lips and nails.

#### **2. Internal Findings**
*   **General:** Marked venous congestion of all viscera. Blood remains liquid.
*   **Brain:** 
    *   Congested and edematous.
    *   **Petechial hemorrhages** in white matter.
    *   **Microscopy:** Degeneration and necrosis of **[[Purkinje cells]]** in the cerebellum (marked decrease in number). This is a specific and crucial finding.
*   **Heart:** Subepicardial and subendocardial petechial hemorrhages. Early rigor of the left ventricle.
*   **Lungs:** Congested, edematous, and may show hemorrhages.
*   **GI Tract:** Mucosa may show hemorrhages.
*   **Liver/Kidney:** Parenchymatous degeneration; evidence of shock.

### **[[Differential Diagnosis]]**

Conditions mimicking Heat Stroke that must be excluded at autopsy:
1.  **Pontine Hemorrhage:** Causes hyperpyrexia and pinpoint pupils.
2.  **[[Cerebral Malaria]]:** Examination of smears from the spleen/brain.
3.  **Meningitis:** Examination of CSF and meninges.
4.  **Strychnine Poisoning:** Associated with convulsions and postmortem caloricity.

### **Medicolegal Aspects**

*   **Manner of Death:** Usually **Accidental**.
    *   Common in laborers, soldiers marching in heat, or individuals trapped in closed spaces (cars, furnaces).
*   **Homicide/Suicide:** Rare.
*   **Workman's Compensation:** Liability arises if the heat stroke occurs during the course of employment (e.g., stokers, miners).

### **Mnemonics**

**"HOT"** (Features of Heat Stroke)
*   **H** - **H**yperpyrexia (>106°F)
*   **O** - **O**ut of water (Anhidrosis/Dry Skin)
*   **T** - **T**roubled Brain (CNS dysfunction/Coma)

**"PAD"** (Autopsy Findings)
*   **P** - **P**ostmortem Caloricity
*   **A** - **A**ccelerated Putrefaction
*   **D** - **D**egeneration of Purkinje Cells
