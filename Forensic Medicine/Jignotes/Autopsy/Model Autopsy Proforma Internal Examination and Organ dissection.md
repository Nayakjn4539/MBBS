# [[Autopsy]] > Model Autopsy Proforma Internal Examination and Organ dissection

### General Rules for Internal Examination

*   **Order of Dissection:** Typically, the cranial cavity is opened first, followed by the thorax, and finally the abdomen. However, in cases of [[Asphyxia]], the brain and chest organs are removed *before* neck dissection to ensure a [[Bloodless Field of Dissection]].
*   **Completeness:** A complete autopsy is mandatory. Partial autopsies have no place in forensic practice because evidence may be missed in unexamined organs.
*   **Techniques:** Organs may be removed one by one ([[Virchow's Technique]]), en masse ([[Letulle's Technique]]), en bloc ([[Ghon's Technique]]), or dissected in situ ([[Rokitansky's Technique]]).

### Internal Examination Proforma

#### A. Head and Neck

**1. Scalp**
*   Reflect the scalp using a coronal incision (mastoid to mastoid).
*   Check the undersurface for **sub-scalp bruising** or [[Hematoma]] which may mimic external injury.

**2. Skull**
*   Inspect the vault and base for **fractures** (fissured, depressed, comminuted).
*   > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Sketch of skull fractures if present

**3. Meninges**
*   **Dura mater:** Check for [[Extradural Hemorrhage]] (EDH). Inspect the superior sagittal sinus for antemortem [[Thrombus]].
*   **Arachnoid/Pia:** Check for [[Subdural Hemorrhage]] (SDH) or [[Subarachnoid Hemorrhage]] (SAH).

**4. Brain**
*   **Weight:** Record the weight (Adult approx. 1300–1400g).
*   **Surface:** Check for gyral flattening (edema), contusions, or lacerations.
*   **Circle of Willis:** Inspect for [[Berry Aneurysm]] or atherosclerosis.
*   **Cut Section:** Serial coronal sections (1 cm thick). Look for petechial hemorrhages (white matter), infarction, or tumors.

**5. Neck Structures**
*   *Note:* Dissect *after* draining blood from the head and chest to avoid [[Artefacts]].
*   **Hyoid Bone & Cartilages:** Check for inward compression fractures (throttling/strangulation) vs outward fractures (hanging). Check [[Thyroid Cartilage]] and cricoid.
*   **Soft Tissues:** Look for extravasation of blood in strap muscles.
*   **Mucosa:** Check laryngeal and tracheal mucosa for petechiae, congestion, or soot particles.

#### B. Thorax

**1. Pleural Cavities**
*   Check for adhesions, effusions (measure volume), blood ([[Haemothorax]]), or pus.
*   Test for [[Pneumothorax]] before opening the chest fully (water pocket test).

**2. Lungs**
*   **Weight:** Right and Left lungs separately.
*   **External:** Color, mottling, [[Tardieu Spots]] (subpleural petechiae), bullae.
*   **Cut Section:** Congestion, edema (frothy fluid), consolidation, or tuberculosis.
*   **Hydrostatic Test:** Perform if [[Infanticide]] is suspected to check for live birth.

**3. Heart**
*   **Pericardium:** Check for fluid, tamponade, or petechiae.
*   **Weight:** Weigh after removing clots.
*   **Coronary Arteries:** Check for patency, [[Atherosclerosis]], or thrombus.
*   **Chambers/Valves:** Dissect using the "Inflow-Outflow" method. Check valve circumference and competency. Look for [[Subendocardial Hemorrhage]] (often seen in arsenic poisoning or shock).
*   **Myocardium:** Check for fibrosis, infarction, or hypertrophy.

**4. Aorta and Great Vessels**
*   Check for atheroma, aneurysm, or traumatic rupture.

#### C. Abdomen and Pelvis

**1. Peritoneum**
*   Check for ascites, peritonitis, or hemoperitoneum.

**2. Stomach**
*   **External:** Ligature at cardiac and pyloric ends before removal.
*   **Contents:**
    *   **Quantity:** Measure volume.
    *   **Nature:** Food particles (identifiable/semi-digested/digested).
    *   **Smell:** Characteristic odors (e.g., Bitter almonds in [[Cyanide]], Kerosene, Alcohol).
    *   **Color:** E.g., Green/Blue in [[Copper Sulphate]] poisoning.
*   **Mucosa:** Congestion, erosion, ulcers, or flattenning (rugae).

**3. Small and Large Intestines**
*   Examine for inflammation, perforation, or characteristic ulcers (e.g., Typhoid).

**4. Liver**
*   **Weight:** Approx 1.5 kg.
*   **Surface:** Smooth/nodular ([[Cirrhosis]]), lacerations.
*   **Cut Section:** Nutmeg appearance (chronic venous congestion), fatty change, or abscesses.

**5. Gallbladder**
*   Check for stones, wall thickness, and patency of ducts.

**6. Spleen**
*   **Weight:** Important in pathology.
*   **Consistency:** Soft/diffluent in septicemia; firm in chronic malaria.

**7. Kidneys**
*   **Weight:** Strip the capsule (easy/adherent).
*   **Cut Section:** Differentiate cortex and medulla. Look for stones in the pelvis.

**8. Pelvic Organs**
*   **Bladder:** Urine volume (preserve for toxicology).
*   **Uterus (Female):** Gravid/Non-gravid, products of conception, instrument marks (abortion).

#### D. Spine
*   Examine for fractures or dislocations if indicated (e.g., traffic accidents, fall from height).
*   Open canal to examine [[Spinal Cord]] if neuro-trauma or poisoning (Strychnine) is suspected.

### Description of an Organ
When describing any organ findings, use the following mnemonic scheme to ensure completeness:

**Mnemonic: "SCSCS"**
1.  **S**ize: Normal, enlarged, or shrunken.
2.  **C**olor: Pale, congested, yellowish, etc.
3.  **S**urface: Smooth, nodular, wrinkled, or capsule status.
4.  **C**onsistency: Firm, soft, flabby, or friable.
5.  **S**ection (Cut Surface): Congestion, bleeding, pus, or specific pathology.

### Sample Collection and Preservation
*   **Routine [[Viscera]] for Chemical Analysis:**
    *   **Bottle 1:** Stomach (whole) + Contents.
    *   **Bottle 2:** Small Intestine (upper 30cm) + Contents.
    *   **Bottle 3:** Liver (500g) + Kidney (half of each).
    *   **Bottle 4:** Blood (10-30ml) from peripheral vein (Femoral).
    *   **Bottle 5:** Urine (30-100ml).
    *   **Preservative:** Saturated Sodium Chloride (common) or Rectified Spirit (ideal, except in alcohol/phosphorus poisoning).

### Opinion as to Cause of Death
(Format based on WHO guidelines)

*   **Part I (Chain of events leading directly to death):**
    *   (a) Immediate Cause: e.g., **Hemorrhagic Shock**.
    *   (b) Due to: e.g., **Rupture of Liver**.
    *   (c) Due to: e.g., **Blunt Force Trauma to Abdomen**.
*   **Part II (Contributing conditions):**
    *   Other significant conditions contributing to death but not related to the disease or condition causing it (e.g., Ischemic Heart Disease).
