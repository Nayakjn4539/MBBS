# Oral Submucous Fibrosis (OSF)

### Definition
[[Oral Submucous Fibrosis]] is a chronic, insidious disease characterized by the deposition of fibrous tissue in the juxta-epithelial layer of the oral cavity and pharynx. It leads to the rigidity of the oral mucosa, resulting in **trismus** (inability to open the mouth) and difficulty in tongue protrusion.
*   It is a well-recognized **premalignant condition**.
*   First described by **Joshi** in 1953 in India.

### Etiology
The etiology is multifactorial, but the chewing of **betel nut (Areca nut)** is the most significant factor.
1.  **Areca Nut (Betel Nut):** Contains alkaloids like [[Arecoline]]. This is the primary causative agent.
    *   **Mechanism:** Arecoline stimulates [[fibroblasts]] to increase collagen synthesis. Tannins in the nut stabilize collagen fibrils, making them resistant to degradation by [[collagenase]].
2.  **Nutritional Deficiency:** Deficiency of vitamins (B-complex, A), iron, and essential minerals.
3.  **Local Irritants:** Excessive consumption of chilies/spices, tobacco, and lime.
4.  **Immunological Factors:** High CD4+ to CD8+ lymphocyte ratio suggests a cellular immune response.
5.  **Genetic Susceptibility:** Associated with specific [[HLA antigens]] (e.g., HLA-A10, B7, DR3).

### Pathogenesis
The core pathology involves an imbalance in [[collagen metabolism]]:
*   **Increased Synthesis:** Fibroblasts are stimulated by arecoline and cytokines (from activated T-lymphocytes and macrophages) to produce excessive collagen.
*   **Decreased Degradation:** Reduced production of anti-fibrotic cytokines and collagenase prevents the breakdown of collagen.
*   **Result:** Fibro-elastotic transformation of the connective tissue in the lamina propria leading to hyalinization and vascular constriction (ischemia).

### Clinical Features
**Age/Sex:** Commonly affects the 20–40 age group; no sex immunity.

**Symptoms:**
*   **Burning sensation:** Especially upon consuming spicy food (intolerance to chillies).
*   **Vesicles:** Repeated vesicular eruptions on the palate and pillars.
*   **Dryness:** Dryness of the mouth and throat.
*   **Trismus:** Progressive inability to open the mouth.
*   **Dysphagia:** If the fibrosis extends to the pharynx/esophagus.
*   **Hearing loss:** Due to Eustachian tube involvement (rare).

**Signs:**
*   **Blanching:** The oral mucosa appears **blanched**, opaque, and marble-like (loss of pink color).
*   **Fibrotic Bands:** Palpable vertical bands in the buccal mucosa and circular bands around the mouth (rima oris).
*   **Tongue:** Shrunken, smooth (loss of papillae), and stiff (limited protrusion).
*   **Uvula:** Shrunken and bud-like.
*   **Floor of mouth:** Leathery and blanched.

**Clinical Staging (Pindborg, 1989)**
| Stage | Features |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Stage 1 (Stomatitis)** | Erythematous mucosa, vesicles, mucosal ulcers, melanotic pigmentation. |
| **Stage 2 (Fibrosis)** | Ruptured vesicles heal with fibrosis. Blanching of mucosa. Vertical/circular fibrous bands palpable. Trismus begins. |
| **Stage 3 (Sequelae)** | Development of [[Leukoplakia]] (>25% cases), speech deficits, and hearing deficits. |

### Clinical Implications and Malignancy
*   OSF is a **premalignant condition**.
*   **Malignant transformation rate:** 3–7.6%.
*   The atrophic epithelium is highly susceptible to carcinogens present in tobacco/areca nut.

### Management
**1. Medical Management:**
*   **Cessation of Habit:** Stop chewing betel nut, tobacco, and pan immediately.
*   **Nutritional Support:** Iron, multivitamin, and mineral supplements (antioxidants like lycopene, beta-carotene).
*   **Steroids:** Submucosal intralesional injections of [[Dexamethasone]] mixed with [[Hyaluronidase]] (weekly for 8–10 weeks) to reduce inflammation and breakdown fibrous tissue.
*   **Placental Extracts:** Used as anti-inflammatory agents.
*   **Pentoxifylline:** Improves vascularity (vasodilator).

**2. Surgical Management:**
Indicated for severe trismus.
*   **Release of Fibrosis:** Sectioning of fibrotic bands.
*   **Reconstruction:** Covering the raw area with:
    *   Split skin graft.
    *   Bilateral tongue flaps.
    *   Nasolabial flaps.
    *   Buccal fat pad graft.
*   **Lasers:** CO2 or KTP-532 laser for dividing bands.
*   **Physiotherapy:** Jaw opening exercises are crucial post-surgery.

# Oral Lichen Planus (OLP)

### Definition
[[Oral Lichen Planus]] is a chronic mucocutaneous, immunologic/autoimmune disorder characterized by a T-cell mediated reaction against the basal epithelial cells.

### Etiology
*   **Idiopathic:** Exact cause unknown.
*   **Autoimmunity:** Cell-mediated immune response.
*   **Stress:** Psychological stress is a common trigger.
*   **Lichenoid Reaction:** Similar lesions caused by drugs (e.g., antihypertensives, hypoglycemics, NSAIDs) or dental materials (amalgam fillings).

### Clinical Features
*   **Sites:** Bilateral **buccal mucosa** is the most common site. Also affects the tongue (lateral borders), gingiva, and lips.
*   **Skin Association:** Skin lesions are present in some cases. Characterized by the **5 P's**:
    *   **P**urple
    *   **P**ruritic
    *   **P**olygonal
    *   **P**lanar
    *   **P**apules (on flexor surfaces of wrists/forearms).

### Types of Oral Lichen Planus
| Type | Characteristics | Symptoms |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Reticular** | Most common. Lace-like white striae known as **[[Wickham's striae]]**. Usually bilateral and symmetrical. | Asymptomatic |
| **Erosive** | Ulcers surrounded by keratotic (white) periphery. | Painful (burning sensation) |
| **Atrophic** | Diffuse redness (erythema) and thinning of mucosa. | Burning sensation |
| **Bullous** | Rare. Vesicles/bullae that rupture to form ulcers. | Painful |

### Diagnosis
*   **Clinical Appearance:** Wickham's striae are pathognomonic.
*   **Biopsy:** Essential to confirm diagnosis and rule out malignancy or dysplasia.
*   **Histopathology:**
    *   Hyperkeratosis.
    *   Basal cell degeneration (liquefaction degeneration).
    *   Band-like infiltration of [[lymphocytes]] in the sub-epithelial layer.
*   **Immunofluorescence:** Linear fibrinogen deposition at the basement membrane zone.

### Malignant Potential
*   There is a dispute regarding malignancy, but **erosive** and **atrophic** forms have a risk of malignant transformation (0.4% to 2%).
*   Regular follow-up is mandatory.

### Management
**1. Asymptomatic (Reticular):**
*   No active treatment required.
*   Reassurance and regular observation.

**2. Symptomatic (Erosive/Atrophic):**
*   **Topical Steroids:** First line. Triamcinolone acetonide in orabase, betamethasone, or clobetasol.
*   **Systemic Steroids:** For severe, widespread, or acute exacerbations (Prednisolone).
*   **Retinoids:** Topical or systemic (for keratotic lesions).
*   **Immunosuppressants:** Cyclosporine, Tacrolimus (for resistant cases).
*   **Remove Irritants:** Replace amalgam fillings if adjacent to lesion; address sharp teeth.

### Mnemonics
*   **Skin Lesions of Lichen Planus (5 P's):**
    *   **P**urple
    *   **P**olygonal
    *   **P**lanar
    *   **P**ruritic
    *   **P**apules

*   **Risk Factors for Oral Cancer/Premalignant Lesions (4 S's):**
    *   **S**moking
