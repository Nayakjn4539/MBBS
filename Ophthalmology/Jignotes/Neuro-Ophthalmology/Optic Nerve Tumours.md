# Optic Nerve Tumours

Optic nerve tumours are significant neuro-ophthalmological entities that can compromise vision and cause proptosis. They are broadly classified into **primary tumours** (arising from the nerve parenchyma or sheath) and **secondary tumours** (extending from intracranial structures or metastases).

The two most important primary tumours are [[Optic Nerve Glioma]] and [[Optic Nerve Sheath Meningioma]].

### 1. Optic Nerve Glioma (Juvenile Pilocytic Astrocytoma)

This is a slow-growing tumour arising from the **astrocytes** (glial cells) of the optic nerve. It is the most common primary orbital tumour in children.

#### Epidemiology and Associations
*   **Age:** Primarily affects **children** (First decade of life; typical age 4–8 years).
*   **Gender:** Slight female preponderance.
*   **Association:** Highly associated with [[Neurofibromatosis Type 1]] (NF1).
    *   30% of optic nerve gliomas are associated with NF1.
    *   15% of NF1 patients develop gliomas.
*   **Laterality:** Usually unilateral, but bilaterality is pathognomonic for **NF1**.

#### Pathology
*   **Histology:** usually **Juvenile Pilocytic Astrocytoma** (Benign, Grade I).
*   Characterized by hair-like (pilocytic) processes and Rosenthal fibers.
*   It causes fusiform enlargement of the nerve due to intradural proliferation.

#### Clinical Features
*   **Visual Loss:** Gradual, painless progressive visual loss is the hallmark. Often noticed late in children.
*   **Proptosis:** **Axial proptosis** (painless and non-pulsatile). Visual loss is often disproportionately severe compared to the degree of proptosis,.
*   **Optic Disc Changes:**
    *   [[Optic Atrophy]] (Primary): Most common presentation.
    *   [[Papilledema]]: If the tumour is anterior or raises ICP.
*   **Strabismus:** May be the presenting sign in young children.
*   **Intracranial Extension:** Can spread through the optic canal to involve the chiasm and hypothalamus.

#### Investigations
*   **X-ray (Rhese View):** Shows uniform, regular, rounded enlargement of the **optic foramen** (seen in 90% of cases).
*   **CT Scan/MRI:**
    *   **Fusiform enlargement** (spindle-shaped) of the optic nerve.
    *   **Kinking** of the optic nerve is a characteristic feature.
    *   The nerve appears tortuous and enlarged within the muscle cone.
    *   MRI is superior for detecting intracanalicular and intracranial extension.

#### Management
*   **Observation:** Preferred for stable tumours with good vision and non-disfiguring proptosis (as they are slow-growing and self-limiting in NF1).
*   **Surgery:** Indicated for:
    *   Cosmetically unacceptable proptosis in a blind eye.
    *   Threat of intracranial extension to the chiasm.
    *   Procedure: Lateral orbitotomy with preservation of the globe.
*   **Radiotherapy:** Used for inoperable tumours or intracranial extension.

### 2. Optic Nerve Sheath Meningioma (ONSM)

A benign but invasive tumour arising from the **meningothelial cells** of the arachnoid villi lining the optic nerve sheath.

#### Epidemiology
*   **Age:** Typically **middle-aged adults** (30–50 years).
*   **Gender:** Strong **female predilection**.
*   **Association:** Can be associated with [[Neurofibromatosis Type 2]] (NF2).

#### Clinical Features
*   **Visual Loss:** Early, slowly progressive visual loss.
*   **Triad of symptoms:** Visual loss + Optic Atrophy + **Optociliary Shunt Vessels**.
*   **Proptosis:** **Axial proptosis**, usually mild to moderate.
*   **Gaze-evoked Amaurosis:** Transient loss of vision in a particular direction of gaze (due to cutting off of blood supply to the nerve by the dural sheath).
*   **Ocular Motility:** Limitation of movement due to the splinting effect of the tumour sheath.

#### Fundus Examination
*   **Optic Disc:** May show edema initially, followed by atrophy.
*   **Opticociliary Shunt Vessels (Hoyt-Spencer Sign):**
    *   Pre-existing vessels that enlarge to shunt venous blood from the retinal circulation to the choroidal circulation because the central retinal vein is compressed by the tumour,.
    *   *Note:* Also seen in [[CRVO]] and chronic [[glaucoma]], but classic for meningioma.

#### Investigations
*   **CT Scan:**
    *   **Tram-Track Sign:** On axial cuts, calcification of the sheath outlines the radiolucent optic nerve in the center.
    *   **Donut Sign:** On coronal cuts.
*   **MRI:** Shows tubular thickening of the nerve sheath.

#### Management
*   **Observation:** In patients with good visual acuity and slow growth.
*   **Radiotherapy:** Stereotactic fractionated radiotherapy is effective in preserving vision.
*   **Surgery:** Difficult to excise without damaging the pial blood supply to the optic nerve. Reserved for blind eyes with severe proptosis or intracranial extension.

### Comparison: Glioma vs. Meningioma

| Feature | Optic Nerve Glioma | Optic Nerve Sheath Meningioma |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Origin** | Neural ectoderm (Astrocytes) | Mesoderm (Arachnoid cells) |
| **Age** | Children (<10 years) | Adults (Middle-aged) |
| **Sex** | F > M (slight) | Females >>> Males |
| **Laterality** | Usually Unilateral (Bilateral in NF1) | Usually Unilateral |
| **Systemic Assoc.** | [[Neurofibromatosis Type 1]] (NF1) | [[Neurofibromatosis Type 2]] (NF2) |
| **Proptosis** | Axial (can be eccentric) | Axial |
| **Visual Loss** | Gradual, early | Gradual, early; Gaze-evoked amaurosis |
| **Disc Signs** | Atrophy/Papilledema | **Opticociliary Shunts**, Atrophy |
| **CT/MRI Shape** | **Fusiform** / Kinked | **Tubular** / Tram-track calcification |
| **Skeletal Change** | Enlargement of Optic Foramen | Hyperostosis (if secondary to sphenoid lesion) |

### 3. Secondary and Metastatic Tumours

The optic nerve can be involved secondarily by tumours arising from adjacent structures or distant sites.

#### Secondary Meningioma (Sphenoid Wing Meningioma)
*   Arises from the sphenoid bone and invades the orbit/optic canal.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Fullness in the temporal fossa.
    *   Proptosis (eccentric).
    *   **Foster-Kennedy Syndrome:** If the tumour is in the olfactory groove/frontal lobe, it causes:
        1.  Ipsilateral [[Optic Atrophy]] (pressure on nerve).
        2.  Contralateral [[Papilledema]] (raised ICP),.
    *   **Hyperostosis:** Reactive thickening of the bone seen on X-ray/CT is characteristic.

#### Metastasis
*   **Children:** [[Neuroblastoma]] (most common), Leukemia.
*   **Adults:** Bronchogenic carcinoma (males), Breast carcinoma (females).
*   **Leukemic Infiltration:** Can cause optic nerve head swelling, mimicking papilledema.

### Clinical Implications and Pearls
*   **Leukocoria differential:** While [[Retinoblastoma]] is the primary intraocular tumour in children, optic nerve glioma must be ruled out in a child with proptosis and visual loss.
*   **Prognostic Indicator:** In Optic Nerve Glioma, the presence of **NF1** is actually a *good* prognostic sign as these tumours tend to be more indolent compared to sporadic gliomas.
*   **Mnemonic for Opticociliary Shunts:** **"M-G-C"**
    *   **M**eningioma (Optic nerve sheath).
    *   **G**laucoma (Chronic).
    *   **C**RVO (Chronic).
