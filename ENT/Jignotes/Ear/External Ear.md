# [[Ear]] > External Ear

### Embryology of External Ear

**1. Pinna (Auricle)**
*   **Origin:** Develops from 6 mesenchymal proliferations known as **[[Hillocks of His]]** around the first [[branchial cleft]] (ectoderm) during the 6th week of intrauterine life.
*   **Arch Contribution:**
    *   **1st Arch (Mandibular):** Forms the **[[Tragus]]** and part of the **[[Helix]]**.
    *   **2nd Arch (Hyoid):** Forms the rest of the pinna (Antihelix, Antitragus, Lobule).
*   **Timeline:** Adult shape by 20th week. Initially low set, ascends to eye level.

**2. External Auditory Canal (EAC)**
*   **Origin:** Develops from the dorsal part of the **[[#Pharyngeal Clefts (Ectodermal derivatives)|First Branchial Cleft]]**.
*   **Process:** An ectodermal plug forms and recanalizes. Recanalization moves from medial (near TM) to lateral.
*   **Clinical Implication:** Failure of recanalization leads to **[[Congenital Atresia]]**.

**3. Tympanic Membrane (TM)**
*   Derived from all three germ layers:
    1.  **Outer layer (Ectoderm):** From the 1st branchial cleft.
    2.  **Middle layer (Mesoderm):** Fibrous layer.
    3.  **Inner layer (Endoderm):** From the tubotympanic recess (1st pharyngeal pouch).

### Anatomy of External Ear

#### 1. Pinna (Auricle)
*   **Structure:** Single sheet of yellow elastic cartilage covered by skin, except for the **[[Lobule]]** (composed of fibrofatty tissue).
*   **Features:**
    *   **Lateral Surface:** Tightly adherent skin (perichondritis is painful here). Landmarks include Helix, Antihelix, Scapha, Tragus, Antitragus, and Concha (Cymba and Cavum).
    *   **[[Cymba Conchae]]:** Surgical landmark for the **[[Mastoid Antrum]]** (suprameatal triangle lies deep to it).
    *   **[[Incisura Terminalis]]:** Gap between the tragus and crus of helix filled with fibrous tissue (devoid of cartilage). **Clinical Implication:** Site for **[[Endaural Incision]]**.

#### 2. External Auditory Canal (EAC)
*   **Length:** Approximately **24 mm**.
*   **Shape:** S-shaped (Outer part directed Up, Back, Medial; Inner part directed Down, Forward, Medial).
*   **Divisions:**
    
    | Feature | Cartilaginous Part (Outer 1/3) | Bony Part (Inner 2/3) |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | **Length** | ~8 mm | ~16 mm |
    | **Skin** | Thick, hair follicles, ceruminous glands | Thin, adherent, no hair/glands |
    | **Defects** | **[[Fissures of Santorini]]** | **[[Foramen of Huschke]]** (in children) |
    | **Pathology** | Furunculosis (hair follicles present) | Exostosis, Osteoma |

*   **Clinical Implications:**
    *   **Examination:** To straighten the canal, pull the pinna **Upwards, Backwards, and Laterally** in adults (Down and back in infants).
    *   **[[Isthmus]]:** Narrowest point of the canal, located at the bony-cartilaginous junction (foreign bodies lodged medial to this are difficult to remove).
    *   **Infection Spread:** Through Fissures of Santorini, infection can spread between the parotid gland and EAC.

#### 3. Nerve Supply of External Ear
Complex supply derived from cranial and cervical nerves (See Table).

| Nerve | Area Supplied | Clinical Relevance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Auriculotemporal Nerve]] (V3)** | Tragus, Anterior wall of EAC, Anterior TM | Referred pain from dental/TMJ pathology |
| **[[Greater Auricular Nerve]] (C2,3)** | Medial surface of pinna, posterior helix/lobule | Anesthesia typically affects this area |
| **[[Lesser Occipital Nerve]] (C2)** | Upper medial surface of pinna | - |
| **[[Auricular Branch of Vagus]] (Arnold's Nerve)** | Concha, Posterior wall of EAC, Posterior TM | **[[Arnold's Reflex]]**: Cough/cardiac depression upon cleaning ear |
| **[[Facial Nerve]] (VII)** | Concha, Retroauricular groove | Vesicles here in **[[Herpes Zoster Oticus]]** |

### Tympanic Membrane (TM)
*   **Dimensions:** ~9-10 mm diameter; pearly grey, translucent, semi-transparent.
*   **Orientation:** Oblique, forms an angle of **55°** with the floor of the EAC.
*   **Parts:**
    1.  **[[Pars Tensa]]:** Lower, tense part. Thickened periphery forms **[[Annulus Tympanicus]]**. Central part tented inwards at **[[Umbo]]**.
    2.  **[[Pars Flaccida]] (Shrapnell's Membrane):** Small upper part, lax, no fibrous annulus. Noted for **[[Prussak's Space]]** medial to it (site for primary cholesteatoma).
*   **[[Cone of Light]]:** Seen in the **Antero-Inferior Quadrant**.

### Diseases of the External Ear

#### 1. Congenital Disorders
*   **[[Microtia]]/Anotia:** Deformity or absence of pinna.
*   **[[Preauricular Sinus]]:** Pit at the root of the helix due to faulty fusion of auricular tubercles. Can get infected/form abscess.
*   **[[Bat Ear]] (Lop Ear):** Abnormally protruding ear (loss of antihelical fold). Corrected by otoplasty (pinnaplasty).

#### 2. Trauma
*   **[[Hematoma Auris]] (Boxer's Ear/Cauliflower Ear):**
    *   **Pathology:** Collection of blood between perichondrium and cartilage (subperichondrial). Cartilage depends on perichondrium for blood supply → necrosis → neocartilage formation → deformity.
    *   **Management:** Aspiration or Incision & Drainage + Pressure dressing (Buttoning).

#### 3. Infections (Otitis Externa)

| Condition | Etiology | Clinical Features | Key Signs | Treatment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Furunculosis]]** | *Staph. aureus* | Localized infection of hair follicle (outer 1/3 only). Severe pain. | **[[Tragal Tenderness]]** (Tragal Sign +) | Antibiotics, local heat, I&D (if abscess) |
| **Diffuse Otitis Externa** (Swimmer's Ear) | *Pseudomonas*, mixed | Generalized canal inflammation, humidity, trauma. | Swollen canal, discharge, pain on jaw movement. | Aural toilet, antibiotic/steroid drops |
| **[[Otomycosis]]** | *Aspergillus niger* (black), *Candida* (white) | Fungal infection. Itching, blocked ear. | **"Wet Newspaper"** appearance, hyphae/spores. | Suction clearance, Antifungals (Clotrimazole) |
| **[[Malignant Otitis Externa]]** (Necrotizing OE) | *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* | Skull base osteomyelitis in **Elderly Diabetics** or Immunocompromised. | Severe nocturnal pain, **Granulations** at bony-cartilaginous junction, **[[Facial Nerve Palsy]]**. | IV Antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin), control diabetes. Avoid surgery. |
| **[[Herpes Zoster Oticus]]** | *Varicella Zoster* | Viral reactivation in Geniculate Ganglion. | Vesicles on concha/EAC, severe pain, Facial Palsy (**[[Ramsay Hunt Syndrome]]**). | Acyclovir, Steroids |

**Mnemonic for Malignant Otitis Externa:**
*   **D** - Diabetes (Elderly)
*   **O** - Osteomyelitis (Skull base)
*   **G** - Granulations (Floor of EAC)
*   **P** - Pseudomonas / Palsy (Facial nerve)

#### 4. Tumors of EAC
*   **[[Exostosis]] (Surfer's Ear):**
    *   **Benign**, bony outgrowths.
    *   **Multiple, Bilateral**, Sessile.
    *   **Cause:** Chronic cold water exposure.
*   **[[Osteoma]]:**
    *   **Single, Unilateral**, Pedunculated.
    *   Arises from tympanosquamous or tympanomastoid suture.
*   **Malignancy:** Squamous Cell Carcinoma is most common.

### Clinical Procedures
*   **Syringing:** Water at body temperature (**37°C**) directed towards **posterosuperior** canal wall. Contraindicated in TM perforation.
*   **Keratosis Obturans:** Accumulation of desquamated keratin in bony canal (Pear-shaped enlargement).
