| Staphylococcal Infections | **Staphylococcus aureus** (coagulase-positive), Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) like **S. epidermidis**. | Gram-positive cocci, arranged in **grape-like clusters**. Catalase-positive, facultative anaerobe, non-motile, non-sporing. S. aureus produces golden yellow pigment. | **Phenotypic typing:** Bacteriophage typing (e.g., phage type 80/81), antibiogram typing. **Genotypic typing:** PCR-RFLP, ribotyping, PFGE, sequence-based typing. | **Cell Wall Associated:** Peptidoglycan, Teichoic acid, Protein A, Cell surface adhesins (clumping factor), Microcapsule. **Extracellular Enzymes:** Coagulase, Hyaluronidase, Staphylokinase, Lipases, DNase. **Toxins:** Hemolysins (α,β,γ,δ), Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL), Exfoliative/Epidermolytic Toxin (ET), Enterotoxins, Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin (TSST-1). | **1. Colonization:** On anterior nares, skin, etc. **2. Introduction into tissue:** Minor abrasions, instrumentation. **3. Invasion:** Via enzymes (proteases, lipases). **4. Evasion of host defense:** Anti-phagocytic activity (Protein A, microcapsule), intracellular survival. **5. Metastatic spread:** Via hematogenous route. | **Epidermolytic/Exfoliative Toxin (ET):** Causes Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS) by cleaving desmoglein-1, leading to separation of the outer epidermal layer (**Nikolsky's sign**). **Enterotoxins (A-E, G-P):** Preformed toxins causing food poisoning. Short incubation (1-6 hrs). They are **superantigens**. **TSST-1 (Enterotoxin F):** Causes Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS). Acts as a **superantigen**, binding non-specifically to T-cell receptors, causing a massive cytokine storm and multisystem disease. **Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL):** Pore-forming cytotoxin, damages leukocytes. Associated with community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA). | **Skin/Soft Tissue:** Folliculitis, furuncle, carbuncle, impetigo, cellulitis, abscess, surgical site infections. **Toxin-Mediated:** SSSS, food poisoning, TSS. **Musculoskeletal:** Septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, pyomyositis. **Systemic:** Bacteremia, sepsis, endocarditis (native & prosthetic valve), pneumonia (post-viral, VAP). **S. epidermidis:** Prosthetic device infections (biofilm formation), stitch abscess. | Pus, wound swab, sputum, blood, midstream urine, feces/vomitus (food poisoning), nasal swabs (for carrier screening). | **Gram stain:** Gram-positive cocci in clusters, often with pus cells. | **Nutrient Agar:** Golden yellow, opaque colonies. **Blood Agar:** β-hemolytic colonies. **MacConkey Agar:** Small pink colonies (lactose fermenter). **Selective Media:** Mannitol salt agar (MSA), salt milk agar. | **Catalase Test:** Positive (differentiates from Streptococcus). **Coagulase Test:** Differentiates S. aureus (positive) from CoNS (negative). Includes slide test (bound coagulase/clumping factor) and tube test (free coagulase). **Protein A detection:** by latex agglutination. | **Automated systems:** VITEK, MALDI-TOF. **MRSA detection:** Cefoxitin disk diffusion, oxacillin MIC, PCR for **mecA gene**, latex agglutination for PBP2a. | **MSSA:** Anti-staphylococcal penicillins (e.g., cloxacillin, nafcillin). **MRSA:** Vancomycin is drug of choice. Alternatives: linezolid, daptomycin, teicoplanin. **TSS:** Clindamycin (reduces toxin synthesis) + anti-staphylococcal penicillin/vancomycin. | - |
| Beta-hemolytic Streptococcal Infections | **Group A Streptococcus (GAS):** S. pyogenes **Group B Streptococcus (GBS):** S. agalactiae **Groups C & G:** S. dysgalactiae | Gram-positive cocci, arranged in **pairs or chains**. Catalase-negative. Produce a wide zone of complete (β) hemolysis on blood agar. | **Lancefield Grouping:** Based on C-carbohydrate antigen in cell wall (Groups A-V). **Griffith Typing (for GAS):** Serological, based on M protein (>150 serotypes). **Genotyping (for GAS):** Based on **emm gene** encoding M protein (>200 genotypes). | **Cell Wall Antigens:** M protein (principal virulence factor, antiphagocytic), Lipoteichoic acid (adhesion), C-carbohydrate, Hyaluronic acid capsule (antiphagocytic, non-antigenic). **Enzymes:** Streptokinase (fibrinolysin), Streptodornase (DNase), Hyaluronidase. **Toxins:** Streptolysin O (SLO), Streptolysin S (SLS), Streptococcal Pyrogenic Exotoxins (SPEs). | **Transmission:** Primarily through respiratory droplets. Skin infections via minor trauma. **Pathogenesis:** Adhesion to pharyngeal/skin epithelium followed by invasion. Disease caused by local inflammation (suppurative) or systemic effects of toxins. Post-infectious syndromes are immune-mediated. | **Streptolysins (O and S):** Hemolysins that lyse RBCs, platelets, and neutrophils. SLO is oxygen-labile and strongly antigenic (basis for **ASO test**). SLS is oxygen-stable and non-antigenic. **Streptococcal Pyrogenic Exotoxins (SPE-A, B, C):** Responsible for scarlet fever rash, necrotizing fasciitis, and streptococcal TSS. SPE-A and C are **superantigens**, causing massive cytokine release, fever, and shock. **Molecular Mimicry:** Streptococcal antigens (esp. M protein) cross-react with human tissues (myocardium, cardiac valves, glomerular intima), leading to Acute Rheumatic Fever and Post-Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis. | **Suppurative (GAS):** • **Respiratory:** Pharyngitis (sore throat), scarlet fever. • **Skin/Soft Tissue:** Impetigo, erysipelas, cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis. • **Systemic:** Bacteremia, streptococcal TSS. **Non-Suppurative (Post-Streptococcal Sequelae):** • Acute Rheumatic Fever (ARF). • Post-Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis (PSGN). **GBS Infections (S. agalactiae):** • Neonatal sepsis and meningitis, puerperal sepsis. | Throat swab (for pharyngitis), pus swab, exudates, blood culture. | **Gram stain:** Gram-positive cocci in short chains, with pus cells. | Fastidious. Grow on enriched media. **Blood Agar:** Small, pinpoint colonies with a wide zone of β-hemolysis. **Selective Media:** Crystal violet blood agar (inhibits other flora). | **Catalase Test:** Negative. **Bacitracin Sensitivity:** GAS is sensitive; GBS is resistant. **CAMP Test:** GBS is positive (arrowhead hemolysis with S. aureus); GAS is negative.  **Lancefield grouping** by antigen extraction and testing with group-specific antisera. | **Automated systems:** VITEK, MALDI-TOF. **Serology (Retrospective Diagnosis):** • **ASO (Anti-streptolysin O) test:** Titer >200 IU/mL indicates recent infection (except in pyoderma/PSGN). • **Anti-DNase B test:** Useful for PSGN and pyoderma. | **Penicillin** is the drug of choice for GAS infections. Macrolides (e.g., erythromycin) for allergic patients. **Necrotizing Fasciitis/TSS:** Surgical debridement + Penicillin + Clindamycin (+ IVIG for TSS). **GBS infections:** Penicillin/ampicillin + gentamicin. | - |
