# [[Legal Procedures]] > Subpoena and Summons

### Subpoena (Summons)

**Definition**
A **Subpoena** (also known as [[Summons]]) is a legal document issued by a [[Court of Law]] compelling the attendance of a witness at a specific date, time, and place to give evidence or produce documents under penalty for non-compliance.

*   **Etymology:** Derived from Latin words **'Sub'** (Under) and **'Poena'** (Penalty/Punishment).
*   **Legal Provision:** Dealing with summons is covered under **Sections 61 to 69** of the [[Code of Criminal Procedure]] (Cr.P.C.).

### Types of Subpoena
There are two main types of subpoenas based on the requirement of the court:

1.  **Subpoena ad testificandum:**
    *   Order to appear in court to give oral evidence (testify).
2.  **Subpoena duces tecum:**
    *   Order to produce specific documents or material objects (e.g., [[Medical Records]], [[Postmortem Report]], X-rays, weapons) in possession of the witness.
    *   **Relevant Sections:** S.91 & 349 Cr.P.C., S.162 [[Indian Evidence Act]], and S.175 [[Indian Penal Code]].

### Essentials of a Valid Summons
For a summons to be legally valid, it must meet specific criteria (S.61 Cr.P.C.):
*   It must be in **writing**.
*   It must be in **duplicate**.
*   It must be **signed** by the presiding officer of the court.
*   It must bear the **seal** of the court.
*   It must contain specific details: Name of the accused, Crime number, Place, Date, and Time of trial.

### Service of Summons
The process of delivering the summons to the witness is called "service".
1.  **General Rule:** Served principally by a police officer, officer of the court, or public servant.
2.  **Personal Service:** One copy is delivered to the witness, and the witness must sign the receipt on the back of the second copy (S.62 Cr.P.C.).
3.  **Government Servants:** If the witness is a government employee, the summons is sent to the Head of the Office, who serves it to the employee and returns the signed duplicate to the court (S.66 Cr.P.C.).
4.  **Registered Post:** Can be sent via registered post with acknowledgment due.
5.  **Affixing:** If the witness cannot be found, the summons may be affixed to a conspicuous part of their house.

### Conduct Money
This refers to the fee offered to a witness to cover the expenses of attending court (travel, food, lodging).

| Feature | **Civil Cases** | **Criminal Cases** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Payment Source** | Paid by the party calling the witness. | Paid by the Court/State. |
| **Timing** | Must be paid **at the time of serving** the summons. | Paid **after** the evidence is given. |
| **Refusal** | If not paid, the witness is **not bound** to attend. | Witness **must attend** regardless; non-payment is not an excuse. |

> **Mnemonic for Conduct Money:**
> **"Civil Cash, Criminal Court"**
> *   **Civil** cases require **Cash** upfront.
> *   **Criminal** cases are paid by the **Court** later.

### Non-Compliance (Disobedience of Summons)
Failure to attend court without a valid and urgent reason (e.g., severe illness) has legal consequences:

*   **Civil Cases:** The witness may be liable to pay damages to the party calling them.
*   **Criminal Cases:**
    *   The Court may issue a **bailable or non-bailable warrant** for arrest to secure presence.
    *   The witness may be sentenced to a **fine or imprisonment** (S.350 Cr.P.C.).
    *   Punishable under S.174 IPC (Non-attendance in obedience to an order from public servant).

### Medicolegal Aspects: Priority of Summons
A doctor may receive multiple summonses for the same day. The priority is determined by the nature of the court and the case.

**Order of Priority:**
1.  **Criminal Courts** have priority over **Civil Courts**.
2.  **Higher Courts** have priority over **Lower Courts** (e.g., High Court > Sessions Court > Magistrate Court).
3.  If courts are of equal status (e.g., two Sessions Courts), priority depends on **which summons was served first** (Date of Receipt).

> **Mnemonic for Priority:**
> **"High Crimes First"**
> *   **High:** Higher Court takes precedence.
> *   **Crimes:** Criminal Court takes precedence over Civil.
> *   **First:** If equal, whoever asked First.

**Action to take in case of conflict:**
*   The doctor must obey the summons of higher priority.
*   The court of lower priority must be informed immediately (in writing/by affidavit) about the conflict and the inability to attend, explaining the reason.
