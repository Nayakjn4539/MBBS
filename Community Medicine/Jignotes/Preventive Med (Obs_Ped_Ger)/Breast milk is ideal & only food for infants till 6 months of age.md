# [[PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IN OBSTETRICS, PAEDIATRICS AND GERIATRICS]] > Breast milk is ideal & only food for infants till 6 months of age

## **Breast Milk: The Gold Standard for Infant Feeding**

Breast milk is universally accepted as the perfect food for the newborn. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Government of India recommend **[[Exclusive Breastfeeding]]** for the **first 6 months** of life. This means the infant receives *only* breast milk—no other liquids or solids, not even water—with the exception of oral rehydration solution, or drops/syrups of vitamins, minerals, or medicines.

### **1. Biological Specificity and Composition**
Breast milk is a "living fluid" tailored specifically for the human infant. Its composition changes to meet the growing needs of the baby.

*   **[[Colostrum]]:** The "first milk" secreted during the first few days after delivery.
    *   Yellow, thick, and small in quantity.
    *   **Rich in antibodies (IgA)**, providing the **first immunization** against infections.
    *   High in protein and Vitamin A; lower in fat than mature milk.
    *   Acts as a purgative to clear meconium.
*   **Fore-milk:** The milk at the beginning of a feed. It is watery and rich in protein, sugar, vitamins, and minerals. It satisfies the baby's **thirst**.
*   **Hind-milk:** The milk at the end of a feed. It is rich in **fat** and provides energy. It satisfies the baby's **hunger**.

### **2. Nutritional Superiority**
Human milk contains all nutrients in the exact proportions needed for optimal growth and development.

*   **Proteins:** Although the protein content is lower (1.1g/100ml) compared to cow’s milk (3.2g/100ml), it has a **higher biological value**. It is whey-dominant (easily digestible) and rich in [[Taurine]] and [[Cystine]], essential for neurotransmission and brain growth.
*   **Fats:** Rich in **Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA)**, specifically Linoleic acid and Alpha-linolenic acid, and DHA, which are crucial for the **myelination** of the nervous system. It contains the enzyme **lipase**, aiding digestion.
*   **Carbohydrates:** High **Lactose** content (7.4g/100ml). Lactose aids calcium absorption and promotes the growth of *Lactobacillus bifidus* (beneficial gut flora).
*   **Minerals:** Low sodium content reduces the solute load on neonatal kidneys. Although iron content is low, its **bioavailability** is very high (~70% absorption vs 30% in cow's milk).

### **3. Immunological Benefits (The Biological Shield)**
Breast milk provides passive immunity and protects against infections.
*   **Secretory IgA:** Protects intestinal mucosa against enteric pathogens (e.g., *E. coli*, *Vibrio cholerae*).
*   **Lactoferrin:** Binds iron, inhibiting bacterial growth (e.g., *Staphylococcus*, *E. coli*).
*   **Lysozyme:** Attacks bacterial cell walls.
*   **Macrophage & Lymphocytes:** Produce interferon and antibodies.

### **4. Advantages of Breastfeeding**

#### **A. For the Baby**
*   **Nutritional Perfection:** Complete food for the first 6 months.
*   **Infection Control:** Lowers risk of diarrhea, respiratory infections (ARI), and necrotizing enterocolitis.
*   **Growth:** Promotes optimal physical growth and higher **[[Intelligence Quotient (IQ)]]** (approx. 8 points higher).
*   **Long-term Protection:** Reduces risk of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and coronary heart disease in adulthood.
*   **Emotional Security:** Promotes "bonding" between mother and child.

#### **B. For the Mother**
*   **Natural Contraception:** Lactational Amenorrhea Method (**[[LAM]]**) provides protection against pregnancy (98% effective in first 6 months if exclusively breastfeeding).
*   **Postpartum Recovery:** Oxytocin release aids in uterine involution and reduces **Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH)**.
*   **Cancer Protection:** Lowers risk of breast and ovarian cancer.

#### **C. For the Family & Community**
*   **Economical:** Saves cost of formula and healthcare (due to fewer illnesses).
*   **Convenient:** No preparation needed; served at the right temperature.
*   **Safe & Hygienic:** No risk of contamination from water or bottles.

### **5. Comparison: Human Milk vs. Cow's Milk**

| Constituent (per 100g) | **Human Milk** | **Cow's Milk** | **Comment** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Protein (g)** | 1.1 | 3.2 | Human milk protein is easier to digest (Whey > Casein). |
| **Fat (g)** | 3.4 | 4.1 | Human milk has more essential fatty acids (PUFA). |
| **Carbohydrate (g)** | **7.4** | 4.4 | Higher lactose in human milk aids brain growth. |
| **Calcium (mg)** | 28 | 120 | Cow's milk has more calcium, but absorption is better in human milk. |
| **Iron (mg)** | 0.35 | 0.2 | Bioavailability is **70%** in human milk vs **30%** in cow's milk. |
| **Energy (Kcal)** | 65 | 67 | Roughly similar caloric density. |

### **6. Contraindications**
Breastfeeding is rarely contraindicated.
*   **Absolute Contraindications:**
    *   Infant: **[[Galactosemia]]**, Phenylketonuria (partial breastfeeding possible with strict monitoring).
    *   Mother: Taking cytotoxic drugs, radioactive isotopes.
*   **Relative/Manageable Contraindications:**
    *   **[[HIV]]**: In India, guidelines recommend breastfeeding with antiretroviral therapy (ART) for mother and prophylaxis for the infant to prevent malnutrition deaths, which outweigh HIV transmission risks.
    *   **Active TB:** Mother can breastfeed but should wear a mask; baby needs Isoniazid prophylaxis.
    *   **Hepatitis B:** Allowed; baby receives Hep B immunoglobulin + Vaccine.

### **Mnemonic**
**"BREAST"** is Best:
*   **B** - **Best** nutrition (Bioavailable Iron, correct Protein ratio)
*   **R** - **Resistance** to infection (IgA, Lactoferrin)
*   **E** - **Emotional** bonding (Oxytocin)
*   **A** - **Allergy** protection (No foreign proteins)
*   **S** - **Stool** is soft (No constipation)
*   **T** - **Temperature** is always right (No heating required)
