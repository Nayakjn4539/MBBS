# Lumbar Spondylosis

### Definition
[[Lumbar Spondylosis]] is a chronic degenerative disorder of the lumbar spine affecting the [[intervertebral discs]], [[vertebral bodies]], and associated joints (specifically the [[facet joints]]). It represents the spinal equivalent of [[osteoarthritis]] in peripheral joints.

### Epidemiology and Risk Factors
*   **Age:** Common from middle age onwards; >80% of people over 50 years show radiographic changes.
*   **Incidence:** Occurs in more than 85% of the population over 60 years.
*   **Predisposing Factors:**
    *   Genetics.
    *    repetitive back strain/trauma.
    *   Heavy weight lifting.
    *   Obesity.
    *   Occupational overhead work.

### Etiopathogenesis
The condition is primarily a result of the aging process and wear-and-tear mechanics.

1.  **Disc Degeneration:** The [[nucleus pulposus]] dehydrates and desiccates, losing its turgidity. This leads to a decrease in disc height,.
2.  **Annular Weakness:** The [[annulus fibrosus]] develops fissures. The disc flattens and bulges beyond the vertebral margins.
3.  **Instability:** Loss of disc height leads to the approximation of the posterior [[facet joints]], causing strain and subluxation,.
4.  **Osteophyte Formation:** Reactive new bone forms at the vertebral margins (traction spurs/[[osteophytes]]) where ligaments are stressed.
5.  **Facet Joint Arthritis:** The altered mechanics lead to osteoarthritis of the facet joints with hypertrophy.
6.  **Stenosis:** Posterior osteophytes, facet hypertrophy, and buckling of the [[ligamentum flavum]] may narrow the [[spinal canal]] ([[spinal stenosis]]) or [[intervertebral foramina]],.

### Clinical Features
Patients are usually over 40 years of age. Symptoms often wax and wane (remissions and exacerbations).

#### Symptoms
*   **Low Back Pain:** Mechanical in nature.
    *   **Aggravated by:** Activity, prolonged standing, sitting, or heavy lifting,.
    *   **Relieved by:** Rest or lying down.
*   **Stiffness:** Early morning stiffness or stiffness after periods of inactivity. Difficulty in getting out of bed,.
*   **Acute Episodes:** History of acute attacks of pain or "locking/giving way" of the back.
*   **Neurological Symptoms:**
    *   **Radiculopathy:** If osteophytes impinge on nerve roots, causing [[sciatica]] or paraesthesia.
    *   **Neurogenic Claudication:** Pain/numbness in legs after walking, relieved by sitting/bending forward (indicative of [[lumbar canal stenosis]]).

#### Physical Signs
*   **Look:** Posture is usually normal, but lumbar lordosis may be lost (flat back).
*   **Feel:**
    *   Vague/diffuse tenderness over the lumbosacral region or [[paraspinal muscles]],.
    *   Muscle spasm during acute attacks.
*   **Move:**
    *   Movements are usually restricted, particularly extension.
    *   **Specific Sign:** Difficulty in straightening up from a forward bent position.
*   **Neurological Examination:** Usually normal in pure spondylosis. Signs of old disc prolapse (e.g., absent ankle jerk) may be present.

**Clinical Implication:** Always rule out referred pain from visceral organs (e.g., renal stones, pelvic inflammatory disease) which can mimic back pain.

### Diagnostic Imaging

#### X-Rays (Lumbosacral Spine: AP and Lateral)
Radiographs are the primary investigation but findings do not always correlate with symptom severity.

| Radiological Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Disc Space Narrowing** | Flattening of the disc space due to degeneration,. |
| **Osteophytes** | Bony spurs (beaking) at the anterior and posterior vertebral margins,. |
| **Sclerosis** | Subchondral sclerosis of vertebral end-plates. |
| **Facet Joint Changes** | Narrowing, sclerosis, and hypertrophy of facet joints. |
| **Alignment** | Possible degenerative [[spondylolisthesis]] or [[scoliosis]]. |

#### Advanced Imaging
*   **MRI:** The investigation of choice to visualize soft tissues. It shows disc hydration status, nerve root compression, and [[spinal stenosis]],.
*   **CT Scan:** Useful for bony details, facet hypertrophy, and spinal canal dimensions.

### Differential Diagnosis
1.  **[[Prolapsed Intervertebral Disc]] (PIVD):** Acute onset, severe sciatic pain, positive [[Straight Leg Raising Test]].
2.  **[[Ankylosing Spondylitis]]:** Young male, morning stiffness improving with activity, elevated ESR, sacroiliitis.
3.  **[[Spinal Tumor]]/Metastasis:** Unremitting pain, night pain, weight loss.
4.  **[[Vertebral Tuberculosis]]:** Constitutional symptoms, localized tenderness, kyphosis.
5.  **Visceral Causes:** Renal, gynecological, or gastrointestinal pathologies.

### Treatment

#### 1. Conservative Management (Mainstay)
Most patients respond well to non-operative measures.

*   **Rest:** Bed rest during acute painful episodes (short duration).
*   **Analgesics:** [[NSAIDs]] (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and muscle relaxants for pain relief,.
*   **Physiotherapy:**
    *   **Acute Phase:** Heat therapy ([[Short Wave Diathermy]]), massage, and [[TENS]] (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) for soothing effect.
    *   **Chronic Phase:** Spinal strengthening exercises (isometric neck/back exercises) and flexion exercises to improve muscle tone.
*   **Orthotics:** [[Lumbar corset]] or belt for temporary support during travel or acute episodes.
*   **Lifestyle Modification:** Weight reduction, avoiding heavy lifting, and ergonomic posture correction.

#### 2. Surgical Management
Surgery is rarely indicated for pure spondylosis unless complications arise.

*   **Indications:**
    1.  Severe, unremitting pain failing conservative therapy.
    2.  Significant neurological deficits (motor weakness).
    3.  [[Spinal instability]] (e.g., degenerative spondylolisthesis).
    4.   severe [[spinal stenosis]] with claudication.
*   **Procedures:**
    *   **Decompression:** [[Laminectomy]] or laminotomy to relieve nerve compression.
    *   **Fusion:** [[Spinal fusion]] if there is instability or associated spondylolisthesis,.

### Complications
*   **[[Spinal Stenosis]]:** Narrowing of the spinal canal leading to neurogenic claudication.
*   **[[Spondylolisthesis]]:** Forward slip of a vertebra (usually L4 on L5) due to facet instability (Degenerative type).
*   **Nerve Root Compression:** Causing chronic radiculopathy.
