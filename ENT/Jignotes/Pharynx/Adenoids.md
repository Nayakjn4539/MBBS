# [[Pharynx]] > Adenoids

### **Adenoids (Nasopharyngeal Tonsil)**

**Adenoids** (also known as the **Luschka’s tonsil**) are a subepithelial collection of lymphoid tissue situated at the junction of the roof and posterior wall of the [[nasopharynx]]. They form the superior component of [[Waldeyer's ring]].

---

### **1. Anatomy and Embryology**

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Location** | Midline, junction of roof and posterior wall of [[nasopharynx]]. |
| **Histology** | composed of vertical ridges of lymphoid tissue separated by deep clefts. <br> **Key Exam Point:** Unlike [[palatine tonsils]], adenoids have **NO Capsule** and **NO Crypts**. |
| **Epithelium** | Ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium (respiratory epithelium). may show stratified squamous/transitional areas. |
| **Development** | Present at birth. Shows **physiological hypertrophy** between **3–7 years** (due to active immunity). <br> **Regression/Atrophy** begins at puberty and usually disappears by age 20. |
| **Immunology** | Produces B-cells (IgG, IgA). Acts as a "sentinel" at the portal of the aerodigestive tract. |

#### **Blood and Nerve Supply**
*   **Arterial Supply:**
    1.  Ascending palatine branch of [[facial artery]].
    2.  Ascending pharyngeal branch of [[external carotid artery]].
    3.  Pharyngeal branch of [[maxillary artery]].
    4.  Ascending cervical branch of [[inferior thyroid artery]].
*   **Venous Drainage:** Pharyngeal plexus.
*   **Nerve Supply:** CN IX ([[Glossopharyngeal nerve]]) and CN X ([[Vagus nerve]]).
*   **Lymphatic Drainage:**
    *   **Retropharyngeal lymph nodes** (Nodes of Rouviere).
    *   Upper deep cervical nodes ([[Jugulodigastric nodes]]).

### **2. Adenoid Hypertrophy (Chronic Adenoiditis)**

Enlargement of adenoids can be physiological or pathological (recurrent infection, allergy).

#### **Clinical Features**
Symptoms arise due to the obstruction of the nasopharynx and Eustachian tube.

**A. Nasal Symptoms**
*   **Nasal Obstruction:** Commonest symptom. Leads to mouth breathing.
*   **Nasal Discharge:** Wet, bubbly nose due to choanal obstruction preventing clearance.
*   **Voice Change:** [[Rhinolalia clausa]] (Hyponasal speech/Denasal voice) due to loss of nasal resonance.
*   **Epistaxis:** Rare, may occur with acute inflammation.

**B. Aural Symptoms (Ear)**
*   **Eustachian Tube Obstruction:** Adenoids block the ET orifice (located on lateral nasopharyngeal wall).
*   **Conditions:**
    *   Recurrent [[Acute Otitis Media]] (AOM).
    *   **[[Serous Otitis Media]] (SOM):** Leading to conductive hearing loss (CHL). This is the *most common cause of hearing loss in children*.
    *   Retracted tympanic membrane.

**C. General Symptoms**
*   **[[Sleep Apnea]]:** Snoring, restless sleep, apneic spells (OSAS).
*   **Aprosexia:** Lack of concentration (due to hearing loss and sleep disturbance).
*   **Failure to thrive:** Difficulty feeding (infants cannot breathe and suckle simultaneously).
*   **[[Adenoid Facies]]:** Characteristic appearance due to long-standing nasal obstruction.

#### **Adenoid Facies (Long Face Syndrome)**
*   **Appearance:** Dull, idiotic expression.
*   **Mouth:** Open mouth (mouth breathing), dribbling of saliva.
*   **Nose:** Pinched nostrils (disuse atrophy of alae nasi), loss of nasolabial fold.
*   **Teeth/Jaw:** Prominent and crowded upper teeth (bunny teeth), retrognathic mandible, **High arched palate** (due to loss of molding action of tongue).
*   **Chest:** Pigeon chest (rare, due to long-standing obstruction).

### **3. Diagnosis**

1.  **Clinical Examination:**
    *   **Posterior Rhinoscopy:** Difficult in young children.
    *   **Cold Spatula Test:** Reduced fogging on a mirror below the nose.
2.  **[[Diagnostic Nasal Endoscopy]] (DNE):** **Gold Standard**.
    *   Visualizes size relative to choana.
    *   **Grading:**
        *   Grade I: < 1/3 obstruction.
        *   Grade II: 1/3 to 2/3 obstruction.
        *   Grade III: 2/3 to nearly complete.
        *   Grade IV: Complete choanal obstruction.
3.  **Radiology:**
    *   **X-ray Nasopharynx (Lateral View):** Shows soft tissue shadow in the postnasal space.
    *   **Fujioka Method:** Calculates **A/N Ratio** (Adenoid depth / Nasopharyngeal depth). Ratio > 0.75 indicates significant hypertrophy.
    *   **Dodd Sign:** Crescent of air between the mass and posterior pharyngeal wall (seen in [[Antrochoanal polyp]], *absent* in Adenoids/Angiofibroma).

### **4. Treatment**

**A. Medical Management**
*   Indicated for mild symptoms or acute infection.
*   Decongestants, Antihistamines (for allergy).
*   **Topical Nasal Steroids:** Can reduce adenoid size.
*   Breathing exercises.

**B. Surgical Management: [[Adenoidectomy]]**

#### **Indications for Adenoidectomy**
1.  **Obstruction:**
    *   [[Sleep apnea syndrome]] (OSAS).
    *   Severe snoring/mouth breathing causing adenoid facies.
2.  **Infection:**
    *   Recurrent rhinosinusitis.
    *   Chronic adenoiditis unresponsive to medical therapy.
3.  **Otological:**
    *   Chronic [[Serous Otitis Media]] (Glue ear) – Adenoidectomy + Grommet insertion.
    *   Recurrent AOM.
4.  **Dental:** Malocclusion.

#### **Contraindications**
*   **[[Cleft Palate]]:** (Overt or Submucous). Removal worsens the gap, leading to **[[Velopharyngeal Insufficiency]] (VPI)** causing hypernasality ([[Rhinolalia Aperta]]) and nasal regurgitation.
*   Acute infection (risk of hemorrhage).
*   Bleeding diathesis.

#### **Surgical Technique**
*   **Position:** Rose’s Position (Neck extended at atlanto-occipital joint).
*   **Anesthesia:** General Anesthesia (Oral endotracheal intubation).
*   **Instrument:** **Boyle-Davis Mouth Gag**.
*   **Methods:**
    *   **Curettage:** Using St. Clair Thompson adenoid curette (blind procedure).
    *   **Endoscopic:** Using **Microdebrider** or **Coblation** (better visualization, less collateral damage).

### **5. Complications of Adenoidectomy**

**A. Immediate**
1.  **Hemorrhage:** Primary or Reactionary.
    *   Management: Postnasal pack.
2.  **Injury:** To [[Eustachian tube]] opening (causes stenosis), uvula, or soft palate.
3.  **Aspiration:** Of blood or tissue (Coroner's clot).

**B. Delayed**
1.  **[[Grisel's Syndrome]]:**
    *   Non-traumatic subluxation of the **Atlanto-axial joint**.
    *   Caused by spread of inflammation from nasopharynx to prevertebral fascia causing laxity of transverse ligament of atlas.
    *   *Signs:* Torticollis (wry neck), pain, fever.
2.  **Velopharyngeal Insufficiency (VPI):**
    *   Causes **Hypernasality** ([[Rhinolalia Aperta]]).
    *   Occurs if submucous cleft palate was missed pre-operatively.
3.  **Nasopharyngeal Stenosis:** Due to scarring.
4.  **Recurrence:** Due to incomplete removal (no capsule to define limits).

### **Clinical Implications & High Yield Points**

*   **HIV in Adults:** Significant adenoid hypertrophy in an *adult* should raise suspicion of **[[HIV]]** infection or **[[Lymphoma]]** / **[[Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma]]**.
*   **Thornwaldt’s Cyst:** A cyst in the nasopharyngeal bursa (remnant of notochord) located within the adenoid mass. Presents with crusting and occipital headache.
*   **Submucous Cleft Palate:** Always palpate the hard palate for a notch and look for a bifid uvula before surgery to prevent VPI.
*   **Mnemonic for Adenoid Facies:** **"LACK"**
    *   **L**ong face
    *   **A**rched palate (High)
    *   **C**rowded teeth
    *   **K**ept open mouth (Mouth breathing)
