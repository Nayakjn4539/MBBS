**Clinical Relevance:**
Strict adherence to the PNDT Act is crucial in clinical practice. A doctor must ensure that no verbal or non-verbal cues regarding the sex of the fetus are communicated during an antenatal ultrasound. Incomplete filling of **Form F** is one of the most common reasons for clinics being sealed by the authorities.
