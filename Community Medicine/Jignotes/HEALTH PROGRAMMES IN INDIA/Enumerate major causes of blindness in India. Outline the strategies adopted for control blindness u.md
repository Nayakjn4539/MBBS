# [[HEALTH PROGRAMMES IN INDIA]] > Enumerate major causes of blindness in India. Outline the strategies adopted for control blindness under National Programme.

### Major Causes of Blindness in India

According to the National Survey on Blindness (2015-19) and recent data, the burden of blindness in [[India]] is primarily driven by age-related conditions. The prevalence of blindness is higher in **females** and rural populations.

**Mnemonic for Causes:** **C**an **R**eally **G**et **P**eople **C**ompletely **B**lind
*   **C**ataract
*   **R**efractive Errors
*   **G**laucoma
*   **P**osterior Segment Pathology
*   **C**orneal Opacity
*   **B**lindness in Children / Diabetic Retinopathy

| Rank | Cause of Blindness | Estimated Contribution (%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. | **Cataract** (Untreated) | **62.6% – 66.2%** (Major Cause) |
| 2. | **Refractive Error** | **19.7%** (Major cause of low vision) |
| 3. | **Glaucoma** | **5.5% – 5.8%** |
| 4. | **Posterior Segment Pathology** | **4.7% – 5.9%** |
| 5. | **Corneal Opacity** (Trachomatous & Non-Trachomatous) | **0.9% – 7.4%** |
| 6. | **Others** (Diabetic Retinopathy, Childhood Blindness) | Remaining % |

*   **Clinical Relevance:** **Cataract** remains the single largest contributor (approx. 2/3rd) to the blind pool. While **Trachoma** was historically a major cause, it is no longer a primary cause of blindness in India due to successful control strategies. **Diabetic Retinopathy** is an emerging cause due to the rising burden of NCDs.

### National Programme for Control of Blindness & Visual Impairment (NPCBVI)

Launched in **1976**, NPCB was the first 100% Centrally Sponsored scheme of its kind.
**Goal:** To reduce the prevalence of blindness from 1.4% to **0.3% by 2020**.

**Strategies Adopted for Control of Blindness:**

The programme has evolved from a single-disease control (Trachoma/Cataract) to **Comprehensive Eye Care**.

#### 1. Disease Control Strategies
*   **Cataract Control:**
    *   Shift from **Camp Surgery** to **[[Fixed Facility Surgical Approach]]** to ensure quality and reduce complications.
    *   Emphasis on **[[Intraocular Lens (IOL)]]** implantation in >80% of surgeries.
    *   Performance of over 66 lakh cataract operations annually.
*   **Refractive Errors:**
    *   **[[School Eye Screening Programme]]**: Screening of children (10–14 years) by trained teachers and link workers.
    *   Distribution of free spectacles to children with refractive errors below the poverty line.
*   **Corneal Blindness:**
    *   Promotion of **Eye Donation** (Hospital Cornea Retrieval Programme).
    *   Observation of **Eye Donation Fortnight** (25th August – 8th September).
    *   Establishment of Eye Banks and Eye Donation Centres.
*   **Emerging Diseases:**
    *   Screening and management of **Diabetic Retinopathy**, **Glaucoma**, and **Childhood Blindness** (Retinopathy of Prematurity).

#### 2. Infrastructure and Human Resource Development
The program follows a 3-tier structure for service delivery:

| Level | Institution/Infrastructure | Functions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tertiary** | **Regional Institutes of Ophthalmology (RIOs)**, Medical Colleges | Centres of Excellence, Professional leadership, Research, Complex surgeries (Retinal/Corneal). |
| **Secondary** | **District Hospitals**, NGO Eye Hospitals | Cataract surgery, IOL implantation, Glaucoma management. |
| **Primary** | **Primary Health Centres (PHCs)**, Mobile Units, **[[Vision Centres]]** | Diagnosis, Refraction, School screening, Referral services (Vision Centers: 1 per 50,000 population). |

#### 3. Decentralized Management
*   Formation of **[[District Blindness Control Society]] (DBCS)**: An autonomous body at the district level headed by the District Collector to plan, implement, and monitor the programme locally.
*   Merger of State Ophthalmic Cells with State Health Societies under **[[National Health Mission]] (NHM)**.

#### 4. Participation of Voluntary Organizations
*   **Public-Private Partnership (PPP):** NGOs play a significant role in delivering eye care services, particularly cataract surgeries.
*   **Grant-in-Aid:** Government provides financial assistance to NGOs for performing free cataract surgeries (Non-IOL and IOL) and other major eye procedures.

#### 5. IEC (Information, Education, Communication)
*   Creating awareness about eye care, preventive measures, and available services.
*   Special focus on **Eye Donation** awareness.

#### 6. Revision of Definition
*   To align with global standards, India changed the definition of blindness under the programme from visual acuity **<6/60** to **<3/60** in the better eye. This helps in prioritizing the "socially blind" who need rehabilitation most urgently.
