# Complicated Cataract

### Definition
[[Complicated cataract]] refers to the opacification of the [[crystalline lens]] secondary to an intraocular disease. It is a result of disturbance in the nutrition of the lens due to inflammatory or degenerative diseases of the other parts of the eye. Note that some authors distinguish this from "secondary cataract" (which usually refers to [[posterior capsular opacification]] or after-cataract), while others use the terms interchangeably; clinically, "complicated cataract" is the preferred term for opacities caused by ocular pathology.

### Etiology
Any condition disturbing ocular circulation or producing inflammatory toxins can lead to this condition.

**Common Intraocular Causes:**
*   **Inflammatory Conditions:**
    *   [[Anterior uveitis]] (Iridocyclitis) – The most common cause,.
    *   [[Pars planitis]] (Intermediate uveitis).
    *   [[Choroiditis]].
    *   [[Hypopyon corneal ulcer]] and [[Endophthalmitis]].
*   **Degenerative Conditions:**
    *   [[Retinitis pigmentosa]] (Pigmentary retinal dystrophies).
    *   [[Pathological myopia]] (High myopia).
    *   [[Gyrate atrophy]].
*   **Ischemic/Vascular Conditions:**
    *   Long-standing [[retinal detachment]].
    *   [[Anterior segment ischemia]].
*   **Glaucoma:**
    *   [[Primary angle-closure glaucoma]] (Acute congestive attacks causing Glaukomflecken).
    *   Absolute glaucoma.
*   **Tumors:**
    *   [[Retinoblastoma]] or [[malignant melanoma]] (in late stages).

### Pathogenesis
The lens is an avascular structure dependent on the [[aqueous humor]] and [[vitreous humor]] for nutrition.
*   Inflammatory or degenerative diseases release toxins and enzymes into the intraocular fluids.
*   These toxins disturb the metabolism of the lens epithelium and fibers.
*   Since the posterior capsule is thinner and lacks an epithelial lining, toxins in the vitreous diffuse easily posteriorly, leading to initial opacification in the **posterior cortex**.

### Clinical Features

#### Symptoms
*   **Visual Loss:** Gradual, painless progressive loss of vision.
*   **Pattern:** Vision is often impaired early because the opacity is located near the **nodal point** of the eye,.
*   **Light Conditions:** Vision is worse in bright light (daytime) and better in dim light (because the pupil dilates, allowing light to pass around the central opacity).
*   **Glare:** Difficulty in night driving due to light scattering.
*   **Uniocular Polyopia:** Doubling or trebling of objects.

#### Signs (Morphology)
**1. Site of Opacity:**
*   Typically starts as a **[[Posterior Subcapsular Cataract]] (PSC)** in the axial region.
*   Exception: In anterior segment pathologies (e.g., corneal ulcers, acute glaucoma), opacities may start as **[[Anterior Subcapsular Cataract]]** or anterior cortical changes,.

**2. Characteristic Appearance:**
*   **Breadcrumb Appearance:** The opacity appears irregular and tufted, resembling breadcrumbs,.
*   **Polychromatic Lustre:** This is the **pathognomonic sign**. When viewed with a [[slit lamp]], the opacities exhibit an iridescent rainbow display of colors (reds, greens, and blues),,.

**3. Progression:**
*   The opacity is initially irregular and porous.
*   It spreads axially towards the nucleus and peripherally towards the equator.
*   Eventually, the entire lens becomes opaque (Total Cataract).
*   In late stages, the cataract appears **dirty white** or **chalky white** due to the deposition of **calcium**.
*   The capsule may become thickened.

### Differential Diagnosis
It is crucial to differentiate complicated cataract from other forms based on morphology.

| Feature | Complicated Cataract | [[Traumatic Cataract]] (Blunt) | [[Diabetes Mellitus]] (True Diabetic) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Site** | Posterior Subcapsular (usually) | Posterior Cortex | Subcapsular (Anterior & Posterior) |
| **Morphology** | **Breadcrumb** appearance with **Polychromatic Lustre** | **Rosette** shaped (Flower-like) | **Snowflake** or Snowstorm opacities |
| **Cause** | Intraocular disease (Uveitis, RP) | Concussion injury | Sorbitol accumulation (Osmotic hydration) |
| **Progression**| Spreads to total cataract | May remain stationary or progress | Can be reversible early; matures rapidly |

### Management

**1. Treatment of Primary Cause:**
*   Active inflammation (e.g., [[uveitis]]) must be controlled before any surgical intervention.
*   Control of intraocular pressure if [[glaucoma]] is present.
*   In cases like retinal detachment, the cataract may need removal to visualize the fundus for repair.

**2. Surgical Management:**
*   **Indication:** When visual loss hampers daily activities or strictly for medical indications (e.g., to monitor posterior segment disease like [[diabetic retinopathy]]).
*   **Procedure:** [[Phacoemulsification]] or [[Small Incision Cataract Surgery]] (SICS) with [[Intraocular Lens]] (IOL) implantation is the standard care.
*   **Prognosis:** The visual outcome is often **guarded** (poor) because the underlying disease (e.g., [[Retinitis pigmentosa]], macular degeneration, or optic atrophy) may have already compromised the [[retina]] or [[optic nerve]].

**Clinical Implication:**
In patients with chronic [[anterior uveitis]] (e.g., [[Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis]]), cataract surgery is complex. A "quiet eye" (free of cells) for at least 3 months is recommended before surgery. [[Heparin]]-surface-modified IOLs or hydrophobic acrylic IOLs are preferred to reduce postoperative inflammation.
