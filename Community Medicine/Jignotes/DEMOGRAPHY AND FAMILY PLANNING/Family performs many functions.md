# [[DEMOGRAPHY AND FAMILY PLANNING]] > Family performs many functions

The [[Family]] is the basic unit of society and acts as a focal point of health care. It is defined as a group of biologically related individuals living together and eating from a common kitchen. The family functions as a biological, social, cultural, and epidemiological unit.

### Functions of the Family

The family performs several vital functions essential for the survival of the individual and society. These are broadly classified as follows:

**1. Residence**
*   One of the major social functions is to provide a clean and decent home (shelter) to its members.
*   In India, residence is typically **patrilocal** (wife moves to husband's house), though **matrilocal** systems exist in some communities.

**2. Division of Labour**
*   Members pool resources and share responsibilities.
*   Traditionally, men were the earners and women managed the household.
*   In modern [[Nuclear Family]] units, there is a shift towards shared responsibilities and joint decision-making.
*   **Concept:** "Union is Strength."

**3. Reproduction and Bringing up Children**
*   The family ensures the survival of the species through **procreation**.
*   It provides the necessary environment for the physical care of the infant (mainly mother) and social education (mainly father).
*   **Medical Importance:** This function is directly linked to [[Family Planning]] and population stabilization.

**4. [[Socialization]]**
*   The family acts as a **bridge** between generations (transfer point of civilization).
*   It transmits cultural patterns, customs, language, beliefs, and codes of conduct from one generation to the next.
*   It creates a sense of **enculturation** in the child.

**5. Economic Functions**
*   The family acts as an economic unit of both **production** and **consumption**.
*   It manages income, expenditure, and property inheritance.
*   It provides economic security to its members.

**6. Social Care and Control**
*   **Status:** Gives social status and identity (family name) to its members.
*   **Protection:** Protects members from insult and defamation.
*   **Regulation:** Regulates sexual behavior and marital activities (e.g., incest taboos).

### Family in Health and Disease

From a medical perspective, the family performs specific functions related to health behavior and psychology:

**1. Child Rearing**
*   Physical care of the dependent young to ensure survival.
*   Involves feeding, nutrition, hygiene, sleep, and discipline.
*   **Note:** Child care practices are socially determined by tradition (e.g., breastfeeding practices).

**2. Personality Formation**
*   The family provides the earliest and most immediate environment for the child.
*   It acts as a **"Placenta"**, filtering out ill influences and modifying others.
*   Determines the individual's capacity to withstand stress and interact with society.

**3. Care of Dependent Adults**
*   **The Sick and Injured:** The family provides front-line care. Studies show families do more nursing than hospitals.
*   **Pregnancy:** Care of women during recognized dependency periods (pregnancy and childbirth).
*   **The Aged:** Essential for the care of the elderly and handicapped, especially in the [[Joint Family]] system.

**4. Stabilization of Adult Personality**
*   The family acts as a **"Shock Absorber"** for the stress and strains of life (injury, death, economic insecurity).
*   It provides emotional security and release of tension, helping maintain mental equilibrium.
*   *Failure of this function leads to mental illness, alcoholism, and broken families.*

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Family Diagnosis:** A doctor must evaluate the family's ability to perform these functions to understand the root cause of a patient's illness (e.g., a "Problem Family" lagging in these functions often produces delinquent children).
*   **Compliance:** Treatment adherence often depends on the family's economic function and emotional support.
*   **Epidemiological Unit:** The family is the unit of study for communicable diseases (e.g., Tuberculosis) and genetic disorders.
