# [[Surgeries In Ophthalmology]] > Cyclophotocoagulation

# Cyclophotocoagulation (CPC)

### Definition and Principle
**Cyclophotocoagulation** is a [[cyclo-destructive procedure]] used to lower [[intraocular pressure]] (IOP) by destroying a portion of the secretory [[ciliary epithelium]] of the [[ciliary body]].
*   **Mechanism:** It utilizes the **photothermal effect** of lasers to cause coagulation and necrosis of the ciliary processes, thereby reducing the rate of [[aqueous humour]] production,.
*   **Goal:** To achieve a target IOP, often in eyes with poor visual potential or where incisional surgery is contraindicated or has failed.

### Types of Lasers Used
1.  **Diode Laser (810 nm):** The most commonly used laser for this procedure. It effectively penetrates the sclera to reach the ciliary body,,.
2.  **Nd:YAG Laser:** Used in free-running or thermal mode (not the Q-switched mode used for capsulotomy).

### Methods of Delivery
There are two primary approaches to performing cyclophotocoagulation:

1.  **Transscleral Cyclophotocoagulation (TSCPC):** The laser energy is applied externally through the [[sclera]] and [[conjunctiva]] to reach the ciliary body.
2.  **Endoscopic Cyclophotocoagulation (ECP):** also known as Endocyclophotocoagulation. This is an internal filtration surgery approach where a probe is inserted into the eye to visualize and treat the ciliary processes directly.

### Indications
This procedure is typically reserved for refractory or advanced cases:
*   **Absolute Glaucoma:** To relieve pain in a blind, painful eye,.
*   **Neovascular Glaucoma:** Often used when filtering surgery has a high risk of failure or bleeding.
*   **Refractory Glaucoma:** Cases that have failed medical therapy and trabeculectomy.
*   **Secondary Glaucomas:** Such as those following silicone oil injection or in aphakia.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Pain Management:** In absolute glaucoma, CPC is effective for pain relief by lowering IOP, reducing the need for enucleation or retrobulbar alcohol injection.
*   **Non-Invasive:** TSCPC is a non-invasive option compared to filtering surgeries, making it suitable for patients who cannot undergo extensive surgery.

# Eye Speculums in Ophthalmic Surgery

### Overview
[[Eye speculums]] are essential surgical instruments used to retract the eyelids and maintain exposure of the [[eyeball]] during ocular procedures. They act as the "shutter opener" for the surgical field,.

### Types of Speculums

| Type | Features | Primary Advantages/Uses |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Universal Metallic Eye Speculum** | • Has two limbs and a spring mechanism.<br>• Adjustable screw to control width.<br>• Open/Fenestrated blades. | • Can be used for both right and left eyes.<br>• Standard for many intraocular surgeries. |
| **Guarded Eye Speculum** | • Similar to universal but has **solid blades** (guards). | • **Solid blades** cover the [[eyelashes]] and meibomian secretions, preventing them from entering the sterile surgical field. |
| **Wire Speculum (Barraquer)** | • Very light wire construction.<br>• Spring action without a screw lock. | • Causes **minimal pressure** on the eyeball (ideal for open globe or cataract surgery to prevent vitreous pressure).<br>• Universal usage. |

### Common Uses
Eye speculums are mandatory for almost all ophthalmic interventions, including:
*   **Intraocular Surgeries:** [[Cataract surgery]], [[Glaucoma surgery]], [[Keratoplasty]].
*   **Extraocular Surgeries:** [[Squint surgery]], [[Pterygium]] excision.
*   **Destructive Procedures:** [[Enucleation]] and [[Evisceration]].
*   **Minor Procedures:** Removal of corneal/conjunctival [[foreign bodies]], cauterization of corneal ulcers.
*   **Examination:** Used to examine the eye in patients with severe [[blepharospasm]] (involuntary tight closure of eyelids).
