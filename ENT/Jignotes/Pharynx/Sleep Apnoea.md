# Sleep Apnoea

### Definition and Classification
[[Sleep Apnoea]] is defined as the cessation of breathing (airflow at the nose and mouth) lasting for **10 seconds or more** during sleep,,.

**Classification of Sleep Apnoea:**
| Type | Description | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Obstructive Sleep Apnoea]] (OSA)** | Cessation of airflow despite persistent or increased respiratory effort. | Obstruction of the upper airway (usually pharyngeal collapse)., |
| **[[Central Sleep Apnoea]]** | Cessation of airflow with *no* respiratory effort. | Failure of the respiratory center in the brain to signal muscles to breathe., |
| **Mixed Sleep Apnoea** | Combination of both types. | Usually begins as central apnea followed by an obstructive phase., |

> **Note:** [[Hypopnoea]] is defined as a reduction in airflow (usually >30% or 50%) associated with oxygen desaturation (≥3% or 4%) or arousal,,.

### Pathophysiology
The primary mechanism in OSA is the collapse of the pharyngeal airway during sleep, particularly during **REM sleep** when muscular hypotonia is maximal,.

1.  **Bernoulli’s Principle:** Narrowing of the airway increases airflow velocity, which creates negative intraluminal pressure, pulling the pharyngeal walls inward and causing collapse,,.
2.  **Muscle Hypotonia:** During sleep (especially REM), the dilator muscles of the pharynx (e.g., [[Genioglossus]]) relax, leading to posterior displacement of the tongue and soft palate,.
3.  **Anatomical Factors:** A structurally narrow airway (e.g., retrognathia, macroglossia) is more prone to collapse.

### Etiology and Risk Factors
The causes are often multifactorial, involving anatomical obstruction at the level of the nose, oropharynx, or hypopharynx.

**In Adults:**
*   **Obesity:** Most common risk factor (short, thick neck),.
*   **Oropharyngeal:** Elongated [[Uvula]], redundant soft palate, macroglossia, tonsillar hypertrophy.
*   **Mandibular:** [[Micrognathia]], [[Retrognathia]].
*   **Systemic:** Hypothyroidism (myxedema), Acromegaly.
*   **Substances:** Alcohol and sedatives (aggravate muscle relaxation).

**In Children:**
*   **[[Adenotonsillar Hypertrophy]]:** The most common cause in children,,.
*   **Craniofacial Anomalies:** Down syndrome, Pierre Robin sequence.

### Clinical Features
**Symptoms (History from patient and bed partner):**
*   **Snoring:** Loud, habitual, and socially disruptive,.
*   **Witnessed Apneas:** Partner reports choking, gasping, or pauses in breathing.
*   **[[Excessive Daytime Sleepiness]] (EDS):** Falling asleep while driving, reading, or watching TV.
*   **Morning Headaches:** Due to CO2 retention and vasodilation,.
*   **Neurocognitive:** Memory loss, irritability, poor concentration, decreased libido.
*   **Children:** Failure to thrive, enuresis (bed wetting), hyperactivity/behavioral issues (often misdiagnosed as ADHD), mouth breathing,.

**Physical Examination Signs:**
*   **Obesity:** Body Mass Index (BMI) > 30.
*   **Neck Circumference:** > 42 cm (17.5 inches) in males; > 37.5 cm in females indicates high risk,.
*   **Oropharynx:** "Crowded" oropharynx, large tonsils, webbing of pillars.
*   **Nose:** Septal deviation, polyps (aggravating factors).

**Mnemonics for Symptoms:** **STOP-BANG** Questionnaire
*   **S**noring
*   **T**iredness
*   **O**bserved Apnea
*   **P**ressure (BP is high)
*   **B**MI (>35)
*   **A**ge (>50)
*   **N**eck Circumference (>40cm)
*   **G**ender (Male)

### Diagnosis and Investigations

#### 1. Functional Assessment Scales
*   **[[Epworth Sleepiness Scale]] (ESS):** Subjective score of daytime sleepiness. A score >10 is significant,.

#### 2. Polysomnography (PSG) - Gold Standard
A comprehensive sleep study monitoring multiple parameters,,:
*   **EEG/EOG/EMG:** To determine sleep stages (REM vs. Non-REM).
*   **Airflow:** Nasal and oral sensors.
*   **Respiratory Effort:** Chest and abdominal movement.
*   **Pulse Oximetry:** Oxygen saturation ($SaO_2$).
*   **ECG:** Heart rate and rhythm.

**Indices Derived from PSG:**
*   **Apnoea Index (AI):** Number of apneas per hour.
*   **Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index (AHI) / Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI):** (Apneas + Hypopneas) per hour of sleep,.

**Grading of OSA Severity based on AHI:**,,
| Severity | AHI (Events/Hour) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Normal | < 5 |
| Mild OSA | 5 – 15 |
| Moderate OSA | 16 – 30 |
| Severe OSA | > 30 |

#### 3. Other Diagnostic Tools
*   **[[Muller's Maneuver]]:** Flexible endoscopy while the patient attempts inspiration with nose and mouth closed. Assesses the level of collapsibility (retropalatal vs. retrolingual),.
*   **[[Drug-Induced Sleep Endoscopy]] (DISE):** Visualizes the airway under sedation to mimic natural sleep and identify specific sites of obstruction,.
*   **Cephalometry:** X-ray measurements of the skull and airway spaces.

---

### Complications (Sequelae)
Untreated OSA leads to significant morbidity,,:
*   **Cardiovascular:** Systemic hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale (right heart failure), arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, stroke.
*   **Metabolic:** Type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance.
*   **Neuropsychiatric:** Depression, cognitive dysfunction.
*   **Social/Safety:** Marital discord ("Snoring Spouse Syndrome"), road traffic accidents due to somnolence.

---

### Management

#### 1. Nonsurgical / Conservative Management
*   **Lifestyle Modification:** Weight loss, cessation of smoking and alcohol (especially before bed),.
*   **Positional Therapy:** Avoidance of supine position (e.g., sewing a tennis ball to the back of the pajama),.
*   **Oral Appliances:** [[Mandibular Advancement Devices]] (MAD) to pull the jaw forward,.

#### 2. Medical Management
*   **[[Continuous Positive Airway Pressure]] (CPAP):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Acts as a "pneumatic splint" to keep the airway patent using positive pressure delivered via a mask.
    *   **Status:** Treatment of choice (Gold Standard) for moderate to severe OSA,.
    *   **Drawback:** Poor compliance (approx. 60%).

#### 3. Surgical Management
Indicated when CPAP fails or in cases of correctable anatomical obstruction,.

**A. In Children:**
*   **[[Adenotonsillectomy]]:** The primary treatment for pediatric OSA due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy,.

**B. In Adults:**
*   **Nasal Surgery:** Septoplasty or FESS to improve CPAP tolerance,.
*   **Palatal Surgery:**
    *   **[[Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty]] (UPPP):** Resection of tonsils, uvula, and part of the soft palate. Effective for snoring but variable success for OSA (approx. 50%),.
    *   **Laser-Assisted Uvulopalatoplasty (LAUP):** For snoring and mild OSA.
*   **Tongue Base Procedures:** Radiofrequency ablation, hyoid suspension, or genioglossus advancement to prevent the tongue from falling back.
*   **Maxillomandibular Advancement:** osteotomies to advance the jaw structure (highly effective but aggressive),.
*   **[[Tracheostomy]]:** Bypasses the upper airway obstruction entirely. 100% effective but reserved for life-threatening, refractory cases due to morbidity,.
*   **Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulation:** Implantable pacemaker that stimulates the tongue to protrude during inspiration.
