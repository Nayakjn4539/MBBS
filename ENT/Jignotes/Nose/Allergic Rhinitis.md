# [[Nose]] > Allergic Rhinitis

### Definition
[[Allergic Rhinitis]] is an IgE-mediated immunologic response of the nasal mucosa to airborne allergens. It is a type I hypersensitivity reaction characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate comprising eosinophils, basophils, and T-cells.

### Etiology and Risk Factors
The condition is multifactorial, involving an interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental exposure.

*   **Genetic Predisposition ([[Atopy]]):** A strong family history is often present. If both parents are atopic, the risk to the child increases significantly.
*   **Allergens:**
    *   **Seasonal:** Pollens (trees, grasses, weeds). Commonly associated with "Hay Fever".
    *   **Perennial:** House dust mites (*Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus*), animal dander (cats, dogs), molds (Aspergillus), and cockroaches.
*   **Precipitating Factors:** Pollution (diesel fumes), climatic changes, and viral infections which increase mucosal permeability to allergens.

### Pathophysiology
The mechanism involves sensitization and a subsequent biphasic reaction.

1.  **Sensitization:** In genetically predisposed individuals, exposure to allergens leads to the production of specific [[IgE]] antibodies which coat the surface of [[Mast Cells]] and basophils.
2.  **Early Phase (Acute Response):**
    *   Occurs within 5–30 minutes of re-exposure.
    *   Allergen bridges two IgE molecules on the mast cell surface causing degranulation.
    *   **Release of Mediators:** Primarily **Histamine**.
    *   **Effects:** Vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, glandular secretion, and stimulation of nerve endings.
    *   **Symptoms:** Sneezing, itching, rhinorrhea.
3.  **Late Phase (Delayed Response):**
    *   Occurs 2–8 hours after exposure.
    *   Infiltration of inflammatory cells (eosinophils, neutrophils, basophils, T-cells).
    *   **Mediators:** Leukotrienes, cytokines, prostaglandins.
    *   **Symptoms:** Sustained nasal congestion/obstruction and tissue edema.
4.  **Priming Effect:** With repeated exposure, the nasal mucosa becomes hyper-reactive; smaller doses of allergens are required to trigger a response.

### Classification (ARIA Guidelines)
The **Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA)** workshop classifies the disease based on duration and severity.

| Classification | Criteria |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Intermittent** | Symptoms present **< 4 days/week** OR **< 4 consecutive weeks** |
| **Persistent** | Symptoms present **> 4 days/week** AND **> 4 consecutive weeks** |
| **Mild** | Normal sleep; No impairment of daily activities/sport/leisure; Normal work/school performance; Symptoms not troublesome |
| **Moderate-Severe** | One or more of the following: Sleep disturbance; Impairment of daily activities/sport/leisure; Impairment of school/work; Troublesome symptoms |

### Clinical Features
#### Symptoms
*   **Paroxysmal Sneezing:** Often in bouts (10–20 sneezes).
*   **Watery [[Rhinorrhea]]:** Profuse, clear, anterior discharge.
*   **Nasal Obstruction:** Due to mucosal edema and venous stasis; often alternating.
*   **Pruritus (Itching):** Involving the nose, eyes, palate, or pharynx.
*   **Anosmia/Hyposmia:** Due to mucosal edema preventing airflow to the olfactory cleft.

#### Signs (Examination Findings)
*   **Anterior Rhinoscopy:**
    *   Mucosa appears **pale, boggy, edematous**, and often bluish or lilac in color.
    *   Turbinates are swollen (hypertrophied).
    *   Thin, watery, or mucoid secretions.
*   **External Signs (Facial Stigmata):**
    *   **[[Allergic Salute]]:** Transverse nasal crease above the tip due to constant upward rubbing of the nose.
    *   **[[Allergic Shiners]]:** Dark circles under the eyes due to venous stasis.
    *   **[[Dennie-Morgan Lines]]:** Pleats or creases below the lower eyelid.
    *   **Adenoid Facies:** In children with chronic obstruction (mouth breathing, high arched palate).
*   **Pharynx:** Granular pharyngitis or "cobblestone" appearance due to lymphoid hyperplasia.

### Diagnosis and Investigations
Diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on history and examination. Investigations are used to confirm specific allergens or in atypical cases.

1.  **Skin Prick Test (SPT):**
    *   **Gold Standard** for identifying specific allergens.
    *   Rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective.
    *   A wheal and flare reaction appears within 15–20 minutes.
    *   *Clinical Implication:* Must stop antihistamines 48-72 hours prior to testing.
2.  **Specific IgE Levels (In Vitro):**
    *   **RAST (Radioallergosorbent Test)** or ELISA.
    *   Useful if skin testing is contraindicated (e.g., dermatographism, severe eczema, inability to stop antihistamines).
3.  **Nasal Smear:**
    *   Shows large numbers of **eosinophils**.
    *   Useful to distinguish from vasomotor rhinitis or viral rhinitis.
4.  **Total Serum IgE:**
    *   Often elevated but non-specific (can be normal in quiescent phases).
5.  **Nasal Challenge Test:** Primarily a research tool.

### Differential Diagnosis
It is crucial to differentiate Allergic Rhinitis from Vasomotor Rhinitis and Infective Rhinitis.

| Feature | Allergic Rhinitis | Vasomotor Rhinitis | Bacterial Rhinosinusitis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Etiology** | Allergen (IgE mediated) | Autonomic imbalance (Parasympathetic overactivity) | Bacteria |
| **History** | Family history +, Atopy + | Triggers: Temp change, stress, irritants | Preceding viral URI |
| **Symptoms** | Sneezing, Itching, Watery discharge | Blockage, Watery discharge, less sneezing/itching | Purulent discharge, Facial pain |
| **Mucosa** | **Pale, Boggy, bluish** | **Congested, Hypertrophic** | **Red, Congested** |
| **Nasal Smear**| Eosinophils | Few/No eosinophils | Neutrophils |
| **IgE / Skin Test** | Elevated / Positive | Normal / Negative | Normal / Negative |

### Management
Management follows a step-care approach based on severity.

#### 1. Allergen Avoidance
*   Most effective if a single allergen is identified (e.g., removal of pets).
*   House dust mite control: Impermeable mattress covers, washing bedding in hot water, removing carpets.

#### 2. Pharmacotherapy
*   **Intranasal [[Corticosteroids]] (INCS):**
    *   **Mainstay of treatment** for moderate-to-severe and persistent cases.
    *   Most effective for relieving **nasal obstruction** as well as sneezing and rhinorrhea.
    *   Examples: Fluticasone, Mometasone, Budesonide.
*   **[[Antihistamines]]:**
    *   *Oral:* Second-generation (non-sedating) preferred (e.g., Cetirizine, Fexofenadine, Loratadine). Effective for sneezing, itching, and rhinorrhea but **less effective for blockage**.
    *   *Intranasal:* Azelastine (rapid onset).
*   **Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists:**
    *   E.g., [[Montelukast]]. Useful in patients with co-existing **asthma**.
*   **Decongestants:**
    *   Topical (Oxymetazoline, Xylometazoline).
    *   *Clinical Implication:* Use for **< 5-7 days** to prevent **[[Rhinitis Medicamentosa]]** (rebound congestion).
*   **Mast Cell Stabilizers:**
    *   Sodium Cromoglycate. Used prophylactically; less effective than steroids.
*   **Saline Douching:** Physically removes allergens and mucous.

#### 3. Immunotherapy
*   Indicated when pharmacotherapy fails or is not tolerated.
*   Involves administration of gradually increasing doses of allergen (Subcutaneous or Sublingual) to induce tolerance (hyposensitization).
*   Only potential **curative** treatment.

#### 4. Surgery
*   Adjunct role only. Does not cure the allergy.
*   Procedures: Septoplasty (for DNS), Turbinoplasty (for hypertrophied turbinates), or FESS (for chronic sinusitis complications).

### Complications and Associations
*   **[[Unified Airway Disease]]:** Allergic rhinitis and **[[Asthma]]** are considered a single entity. Treating rhinitis improves asthma control.
*   **Recurrent Sinusitis:** Due to ostial obstruction.
*   **Serous Otitis Media (OME):** Due to Eustachian tube dysfunction.
*   **Nasal Polyps:** Seen in 2% of cases.
*   **Sleep Disturbance:** Snoring and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).
