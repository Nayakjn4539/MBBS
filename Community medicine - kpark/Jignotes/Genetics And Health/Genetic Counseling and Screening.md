# [[Genetics And Health]] > Genetic Counseling and Screening

### Genetic Counseling and Screening

**[[Genetic Counseling]]** is a process of communication and education that addresses concerns relating to the development and transmission of hereditary disorders. It acts as a bridge between genetic information and the patient/family to help them make informed medical and personal decisions.

### Types of Genetic Counseling

1.  **Prospective Genetic Counseling:**
    *   This is the **true prevention** of disease.
    *   It involves identifying [[heterozygous]] individuals (carriers) for a particular defect through screening procedures *before* they have an affected child.
    *   **Goal:** To explain the risk to carriers if they marry another carrier (e.g., [[Thalassemia]], [[Sickle cell anemia]]). By preventing high-risk marriages, the incidence of affected offspring is reduced.

2.  **Retrospective Genetic Counseling:**
    *   This is the most common form currently.
    *   It is offered *after* a hereditary disorder has already occurred within the family.
    *   **Methods suggested:** Contraception, Pregnancy termination (MTP), or Sterilization.

### Components of Genetic Counseling

1.  **Correct Diagnosis:** Establishing the exact genetic cause.
2.  **Estimation of Risk:** Calculating the recurrence risk (e.g., Mendelian inheritance probabilities).
3.  **Communication:** Explaining the natural history, complications, and prognosis to the family.
4.  **Management:** Discussing availability of treatment or palliative care and prevention methods.

### Indications for Genetic Counseling & Prenatal Diagnosis

Genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis (like [[Amniocentesis]]) are indicated in the following high-risk situations:

*   **Advanced Maternal Age:** Women aged 35 years or more (increased risk of [[Down’s Syndrome]] due to nondisjunction).
*   **Previous Affected Child:** Parents who have had a child with chromosomal anomalies or metabolic defects.
*   **Family History:** History of sex-linked genetic diseases (e.g., [[Haemophilia]], [[Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy]]).
*   **Carriers:** Parents known to have chromosomal translocation.
*   **Consanguinity:** History of marriage between close blood relatives.
*   **History of Recurrent Abortions.**

### Genetic Screening

Screening implies searching for unrecognized genetic defects in an apparently healthy population.

#### 1. Prenatal Diagnosis/Screening
Used to detect abnormalities in the fetus to offer the option of therapeutic abortion.

| Method | Time | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Amniocentesis]]** | **14–16 Weeks** | Culture of fetal cells for chromosomal analysis (Karyotyping) and biochemical analysis of fluid (e.g., [[Alpha-fetoprotein]] for Neural Tube Defects). |
| **Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)** | **9–11 Weeks** | Allows earlier diagnosis of chromosomal status; DNA analysis. |
| **Ultrasonography (USG)** | Trimester specific | Visualizes structural anomalies like Anencephaly, Spina Bifida, and Hydrocephalus. |
| **Maternal Serum Screening** | 1st/2nd Trimester | Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), HCG, Estriol (Triple test) for Trisomies. |

#### 2. Neonatal Screening (Screening of Newborns)
The objective is to detect treatable genetic conditions early to prevent damage (Secondary Prevention).

*   **[[Neonatal Hypothyroidism]] (Congenital Hypothyroidism):** Most common. Tested using cord blood for TSH/T4. Early treatment prevents cretinism (mental retardation).
*   **[[Phenylketonuria]] (PKU):**
    *   Deficiency of *Phenylalanine hydroxylase*.
    *   **Test:** **[[Guthrie Test]]**. Blood collected by heel prick on filter paper.
    *   **Timing:** Done **after** 6–10 days of birth (after feeding is established) because the test depends on the accumulation of phenylalanine metabolites.
*   **[[Congenital Dislocation of Hip]] (CDH):** Clinical screening using Ortolani and Barlow maneuvers.
*   **Sickle Cell Disease / Thalassemia:** Using Hb electrophoresis.

### Preventive and Social Measures in Genetics

#### A. Eugenics
The science aiming to improve the genetic endowment of the human population.
*   **Negative Eugenics:** Discouraging reproduction among those with genetic defects to reduce the frequency of disability (e.g., Sterilization, MTP).
*   **Positive Eugenics:** Encouraging reproduction among carriers of "desirable" genotypes (e.g., sperm banks of geniuses). Note: This is difficult to apply practically.

#### B. Euthenics
Mere improvement of genotype is useless without a suitable environment. **[[Euthenics]]** involves environmental manipulation (better nutrition, education, sanitation) to allow the existing genes to express themselves optimally.

#### C. Consanguineous Marriages
Marriages between blood relatives increase the risk of offspring inheriting **autosomal recessive traits** (e.g., Albinism, Alkaptoneuria, PKU) and increases the death rate in offspring. Reducing consanguinity is a preventive measure.

#### D. Late Marriages
Preventing late marriages (in females >35 years) reduces the incidence of Trisomy 21 (Mongolism/Down's Syndrome).

**"Please Check The Hip"**
*   **P** - **P**henylketonuria (PKU)
*   **C** - **C**ongenital Hypothyroidism
*   **T** - **T**halassemia / Sickle Cell
*   **Hip** - Congenital Dislocation of **Hip**
