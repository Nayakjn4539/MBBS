# Ewing’s Sarcoma

### Introduction and Definition
[[Ewing's Sarcoma]] is a highly malignant, non-osteogenic primary bone tumor. It is a member of the **Ewing Sarcoma Family of Tumors (ESFT)**, which are characterized as primitive neuroectodermal tumors ([[PNET]]).
*   It is the **second most common** primary malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents (after [[Osteosarcoma]]),.
*   It is historically believed to arise from endothelial cells of the bone marrow, though modern genetics link it to neuroectodermal origin,.

### Epidemiology
*   **Age:** Predominantly affects children and young adults.
    *   Most common in the **2nd decade** (10–20 years).
    *   Range: 5–30 years,.
*   **Sex:** Males are affected more frequently than females (**M:F = 3:2**),.
*   **Race:** Extremely rare in the African-American population.

### Genetics and Cytogenetics
A characteristic chromosomal translocation is the hallmark of this disease.
*   **Translocation:** **t(11;22)(q24;q12)** is seen in 90–95% of cases,.
*   **Gene Fusion:** This translocation results in the fusion of the **EWS** gene on chromosome 22 with the **FLI1** gene on chromosome 11, creating the **EWS-FLI1** fusion protein,.
*   **Tumor Marker:** **MIC-2 (CD99)** is a specific immunohistochemical marker found on the cell surface,.

### Site of Involvement
The tumor can affect any bone but has a predilection for the **diaphysis** of long bones and flat bones.
*   **Long Bones:** [[Femur]] (most common), [[Tibia]], [[Fibula]], [[Humerus]],,.
    *   *Classic location:* **Mid-diaphysis**.
*   **Flat Bones:** [[Pelvis]] (common in older patients), [[Scapula]], [[Ribs]],.

### Pathology
#### 1. Gross Appearance
*   The tumor arises in the medullary canal.
*   It is soft, greyish-white, friable, and semi-liquid in consistency.
*   It often resembles **pus** (sometimes leading to a misdiagnosis of [[Osteomyelitis]]),.
*   Areas of necrosis and hemorrhage are common due to rapid growth outpacing blood supply.

#### 2. Histopathology
*   **Cell Type:** Sheets of uniform, **small, round, blue cells**,.
*   **Nucleus:** Large, round nucleus with prominent chromatin.
*   **Cytoplasm:** Scanty, ill-defined cytoplasm.
*   **Arrangement:** Cells may form **Pseudo-rosettes** (cells surrounding a clear central area).
*   **Staining:**
    *   **PAS Positive:** The cytoplasm contains **glycogen**, which stains positive with [[Periodic Acid-Schiff]] (PAS) stain and is diastase digestible,. (This distinguishes it from [[Lymphoma]]/[[Reticulum Cell Sarcoma]] which are usually PAS negative).
    *   **Reticulin Stain:** Negative (Reticulin fibers are absent between cells).

### Clinical Features
The clinical presentation can be misleading and often mimics an infection.
*   **Pain:** The earliest and most constant symptom. Initially intermittent, becoming constant and severe, often worse at night,.
*   **Swelling:** A rapidly growing mass. In diaphyseal lesions, it produces a **fusiform swelling**.
*   **Systemic Symptoms:** Unlike many other bone tumors, Ewing's sarcoma often presents with systemic signs mimicking inflammation,,:
    *   Fever.
    *   Anemia.
    *   Leukocytosis (High WBC count).
    *   Raised [[Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate]] (ESR).
*   **Local Signs:** Increased local temperature, tenderness, and dilated veins over the swelling.

### Diagnostic Imaging
#### 1. X-Ray (Plain Radiograph)
*   **Location:** Central lytic lesion in the **diaphysis** or metadiaphysis.
*   **Bone Destruction:** Permeative or "moth-eaten" bone destruction involving a large segment of the bone.
*   **Periosteal Reaction:** Classically described as **"Onion-peel" appearance** (lamellated periosteal reaction). This is due to the cyclic rapid growth of the tumor lifting the periosteum, followed by new bone formation,,.
*   **Codman's Triangle:** May be present at the edges of the lesion,.
*   **Soft Tissue Mass:** A large soft tissue shadow is often visible extending beyond the bone.

#### 2. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)
*   Evaluation of the full extent of marrow involvement (often more extensive than seen on X-ray).
*   Assesses the size of the extra-osseous soft tissue component.

#### 3. Bone Scintigraphy (Technetium-99m)
*   To detect **skip lesions** and polyostotic involvement (metastasis to other bones).

### Differential Diagnosis
Since Ewing's Sarcoma presents with fever, pain, and swelling, it is most commonly confused with infections.

| Condition | Differentiating Features |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Acute Osteomyelitis]]** | Short history, high fever, exquisite tenderness. X-ray shows involucrum/sequestrum later. Aspiration yields pus (neutrophils) vs tumor cells,. |
| **[[Osteosarcoma]]** | Usually metaphyseal. X-ray shows "Sun-burst" appearance and tumor bone formation. Biopsy shows osteoid production. |
| **[[Eosinophilic Granuloma]]** | Benign, lytic lesion. Vertebra plana in spine. Biopsy shows Langerhans cells and eosinophils. |
| **[[Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma]]** | Older age group. PAS negative. Reticulin stain positive. |
| **[[Metastatic Neuroblastoma]]** | Children < 5 years. Urinary VMA (Vanillylmandelic acid) elevated. |

### Treatment
Ewing's sarcoma is a systemic disease at diagnosis (micrometastasis is assumed). Therefore, treatment is **multimodal**,.

#### 1. Chemotherapy (Systemic Control)
*   **Role:** To shrink the primary tumor (neoadjuvant) and treat micrometastases (adjuvant).
*   **Regimen:** Multi-agent chemotherapy is standard.
*   **Drugs:** **VACA** or **VAC-IE** regimen.
    *   **V**incristine
    *   **A**driamycin (Doxorubicin)
    *   **C**yclophosphamide
    *   **A**ctinomycin-D
    *   **I**fosfamide
    *   **E**toposide,.
*   **Duration:** Cycles repeated every 3-4 weeks for 6-12 months.

#### 2. Local Control (Surgery vs. Radiotherapy)
*   **Radiotherapy:**
    *   Ewing's sarcoma is **highly radiosensitive** (classically described as "melting like snow" under radiation).
    *   However, high recurrence rates and risk of radiation-induced sarcomas/growth arrest have reduced its use as the *sole* treatment,.
    *   **Indication:** Used for lesions in surgically inaccessible sites (e.g., Spine, Pelvis) or if margins are positive,.
*   **Surgery:**
    *   **Limb Salvage Surgery:** Wide resection of the tumor followed by reconstruction (using endoprosthesis or bone graft). This is now the preferred method for resectable tumors,.
    *   **Amputation:** Reserved for massive tumors encasing neurovascular bundles or in very young children with significant leg length discrepancy issues.

### Prognosis
Before modern chemotherapy, mortality was >90%. With current multimodal therapy, the **5-year survival rate is 60–70%** for localized disease,.

**Poor Prognostic Factors:**
1.  **Metastasis** at presentation (Lung/Bone).
2.  **Site:** Pelvic or Axial skeleton lesions (harder to resect).
3.  **Size:** Large tumor volume.
4.  **Response:** Poor histological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (<90% necrosis).
5.  **Age:** Older patients have a worse prognosis.
6.  **Markers:** High [[Lactate Dehydrogenase]] (LDH) levels.
