# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Intra-dermal rabies vaccination

### **Intra-dermal Rabies Vaccination (IDRV)**

**[[Intra-dermal Rabies Vaccination]]** (IDRV) is a cost-effective and highly immunogenic method of administering [[Cell Culture Vaccines]] (CCVs) for the prevention of rabies. It utilizes the dense network of antigen-presenting cells (dendritic cells) in the dermis to elicit a rapid and potent immune response,.

---

### **1. Advantages of IDRV**
*   **Dose Sparing:** Uses only **0.1 ml** per site, which is **1/5th** of the standard intramuscular (IM) dose,.
*   **Cost-Effective:** Significantly reduces the cost of vaccination, making it economical for public health programs.
*   **Better Compliance:** Fewer vials needed and lower cost improve patient adherence.
*   **Early Seroconversion:** Generates a robust antibody response rapidly due to direct delivery to lymphatic drainage.

---

### **2. Approved Vaccines for ID Use**
Not all rabies vaccines are approved for the ID route. In India, the following [[Cell Culture Vaccines]] are accredited for ID use,:
*   **PVRV:** Purified Vero Cell Rabies Vaccine (e.g., Verorab, Abhayrab).
*   **PCECV:** Purified Chick Embryo Cell Vaccine (e.g., Rabipur).
*   **Note:** The vaccine vial must be reconstituted with **sterile water** or the supplied diluent and used within **6–8 hours**,.

### **3. Schedules and Regimens**

#### **A. Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)**
The current WHO and National Guideline recommended schedule is the **Updated Thai Red Cross Regimen** (also known as the **2-2-2-0-2** regimen),.

| **Day** | **No. of Sites** | **Dose per Site** | **Site of Injection** |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Day 0** | 2 | 0.1 ml | Deltoid (one on each arm) |
| **Day 3** | 2 | 0.1 ml | Deltoid (one on each arm) |
| **Day 7** | 2 | 0.1 ml | Deltoid (one on each arm) |
| **Day 14** | **0** | - | **Skipped** |
| **Day 28** | 2 | 0.1 ml | Deltoid (one on each arm) |

*   **Total Visits:** 4 visits.
*   **Total Doses:** 8 doses (Total volume used: 0.8 ml).
*   > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a timeline showing 4 visits at Day 0, 3, 7, and 28 with two dots on shoulders representing injection sites for each visit. Cross out Day 14.

#### **B. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)**
Recommended for high-risk groups (veterinarians, lab workers, animal handlers).
*   **Dose:** 0.1 ml ID per site.
*   **Schedule:** Day **0**, Day **7**, and Day **21** or **28**.
*   **Site:** One site (Deltoid).

#### **C. Re-exposure Prophylaxis**
For individuals with documented previous complete vaccination.
*   **Regimen:** 0.1 ml ID at 1 site.
*   **Schedule:** Day **0** and Day **3**.
*   **Note:** [[Rabies Immunoglobulin]] (RIG) is **not** indicated for re-exposure.

### **4. Technique of Administration**
1.  **Syringe:** Use a **1 ml insulin syringe** with a fixed **28G** needle.
2.  **Site Preparation:** Clean skin with 70% ethanol or isopropyl alcohol; allow to dry.
3.  **Insertion:** Insert needle bevel up at a **10–15 degree angle** into the dermis.
4.  **Observation:** A raised **bleb (wheal)** of approximately 5 mm diameter with an "orange peel" appearance indicates correct deposition.
5.  **Location:** **Deltoid** area is preferred. In small children, the anterolateral thigh may be used. **Never** use the gluteal region.

---

### **5. Contraindications & Precautions**
The ID route is generally safe, but the **Intramuscular (IM) route** is preferred in the following specific conditions due to potential reduced immune response,:
*   **Immunocompromised states:** HIV/AIDS, congenital immunodeficiency.
*   **Drug Therapy:** Patients on **Chloroquine** (for malaria), long-term corticosteroids, or other immunosuppressive drugs.
*   **Chronic Disease:** Uncontrolled diabetes, liver cirrhosis, severe malnutrition.

---

### **Clinical Relevance**
*   **Patient Compliance:** Since the ID regimen requires fewer vials and costs less, patients in low-resource settings are less likely to dropout of the treatment schedule.
*   **Wound Management:** ID vaccination must always be accompanied by proper wound washing (soap and water for 15 mins) and infiltration of [[Rabies Immunoglobulin]] (RIG) for Category III bites.
*   **Vaccine Potency:** Ensure the vaccine has a minimum potency of **2.5 IU** per IM dose.

### **Mnemonic**
**"2-2-2, Skip a few, Finish with 2"**
*(For Updated Thai Red Cross Regimen)*
*   **2** shots on Day 0
*   **2** shots on Day 3
*   **2** shots on Day 7
*   **Skip a few** (Skip Day 14)
*   **Finish with 2** shots on Day 28
