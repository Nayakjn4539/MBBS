# [[DEMOGRAPHY AND FAMILY PLANNING]] > In a block of Nadia district CPR (couple protection rate) is less in comparison to neighbouring blocks. What are the social causes of poor CPR and what measures will you take up as a BMOH to improve the situation?

### Social Causes of Poor Couple Protection Rate (CPR)

**[[Couple Protection Rate]] (CPR)** is defined as the percentage of [[eligible couples]] effectively protected against childbirth by one of the approved methods of family planning (Sterilization, IUD, Condom, or Oral Pills). A low CPR in a specific block compared to neighbours indicates specific socio-cultural or service delivery barriers.

**1. Literacy and Education:**
*   **Female Illiteracy:** There is a direct inverse relationship between female literacy and fertility. Lack of education prevents women from understanding the benefits of small families and accessing services.
*   **Ignorance:** Lack of awareness regarding available contraceptive methods, specifically **[[spacing methods]]**.

**2. Cultural and Religious Factors:**
*   **[[Son Preference]]:** Deep-rooted desire for a male child leads to repeated pregnancies until a son is born, disregarding contraception.
*   **Religious Beliefs:** Misconceptions that children are "Gifts of God" and interfering with conception is a sin.
*   **Fatalism:** The belief that destiny determines family size.

**3. Status of Women:**
*   **Early Marriage:** Prevalent in rural blocks, leading to a longer reproductive span.
*   **Low Decision-Making Power:** Women often lack the autonomy to choose contraception or negotiate condom use with husbands.

**4. Economic Factors:**
*   **Poverty:** Children are viewed as "economic assets" or "poor man's wealth" to earn wages or support parents in old age.
*   **High Infant Mortality:** Fear of child loss leads to higher fertility as an insurance mechanism (Replacement effect).

**5. Psychological Barriers:**
*   **Myths and Misconceptions:** Fear that sterilization causes weakness or loss of libido (especially in men regarding [[Vasectomy]]).
*   **Social Stigma:** Embarrassment in procuring contraceptives like condoms from local shops or depot holders.

### Measures to Improve CPR as a BMOH (Block Medical Officer of Health)

As a BMOH, the approach involves the **[[Management Cycle]]**: Assessment, Planning, Implementation, and Evaluation.

#### 1. Situation Analysis and Planning
*   **Review Data:** Analyze the **[[Eligible Couple Register]]** at Sub-centres to identify high-fertility villages and pockets with high **[[unmet need]]** for family planning.
*   **[[Community Needs Assessment Approach]] (CNAA):** Shift from target-based to demand-driven planning. Instruct ANMs to prepare sub-centre action plans based on actual community needs.
*   **Gap Analysis:** Identify if the low CPR is due to lack of demand (social factors) or lack of supply (service failure).

#### 2. Strengthening Service Delivery
*   **Cafeteria Approach:** Ensure a "basket of choice" is available. Ensure continuous supply of **[[Oral Contraceptive Pills]]** (Mala-N), Condoms (Nirodh), and Emergency Contraceptives (E-pills) at the village level.
*   **Newer Contraceptives:** Promote newer methods like **[[Centchroman]] (Chhaya)** and Injectable Contraceptive **[[MPA]] (Antara)** to increase choices for spacing.
*   **Fixed Day Static Services:** Ensure sterilization services (Tubectomy/NSV) and IUCD insertions are available at the PHC/CHC on fixed days and times to build reliability.
*   **[[PPIUCD]] Services:** Strengthen Post-Partum IUCD insertion services immediately after institutional deliveries.

#### 3. Human Resource Development
*   **Training:** Retrain ANMs and ASHAs in counseling skills (using the **GATHER** approach) and technical skills for IUCD insertion.
*   **Activate Depot Holders:** Ensure **[[ASHA]]** workers act as effective depot holders for contraceptives and Pregnancy Testing Kits (**[[Nischay Kit]]**) to detect pregnancy early.

#### 4. Information, Education, and Communication (IEC)
*   **Focus on Men:** Organize awareness campaigns targeting men to promote **[[No Scalpel Vasectomy]] (NSV)** and condom usage to break the myth that FP is solely a woman's responsibility.
*   **Targeted Interventions:** Use satisfied acceptors as motivators in the community to dispel myths regarding side effects.
*   **Adolescent Education:** Strengthen **[[ARSH]] (Adolescent Reproductive and Sexual Health)** clinics to educate on delayed marriage and teenage pregnancy.

#### 5. Monitoring and Supervision
*   **Review Meetings:** Conduct monthly review meetings with Health Assistants (Male/Female) and ANMs to monitor the **[[couple protection rate]]** and drop-out rates.
*   **Incentives:** Ensure timely disbursement of compensation to beneficiaries (e.g., for sterilization) and incentives to ASHAs (e.g., for ensuring spacing of 3 years) to maintain motivation.

### Clinical Relevance
**[[Unmet Need for Family Planning]]**: This is a crucial concept for a BMOH. It refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether (limiting). The BMOH must target this group first to rapidly improve CPR.
