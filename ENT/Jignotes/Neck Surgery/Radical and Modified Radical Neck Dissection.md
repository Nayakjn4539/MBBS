# Radical and Modified Radical Neck Dissection

**Neck Dissection** (Cervical Lymphadenectomy) is the systematic en bloc removal of lymph nodes and lymph-bearing structures, including surrounding fibrofatty tissue, from the various compartments of the neck. It is the standard of care for managing cervical metastasis in head and neck malignancies.

### Classification of Neck Nodes (Surgical Levels)
To understand the extent of dissection, one must know the nodal levels:
*   **Level I:** [[Submental nodes]] (IA) and [[Submandibular nodes]] (IB).
*   **Level II:** [[Upper Jugular nodes]] (Skull base to hyoid/carotid bifurcation). Split into IIA (anterior to [[Spinal Accessory Nerve]]) and IIB (posterior to nerve).
*   **Level III:** [[Middle Jugular nodes]] (Hyoid to cricoid/omohyoid).
*   **Level IV:** [[Lower Jugular nodes]] (Cricoid to clavicle).
*   **Level V:** [[Posterior Triangle nodes]] (Posterior to SCM). VA (superior) and VB (inferior).
*   **Level VI:** [[Anterior Compartment nodes]] (Pretracheal, Paratracheal, Prelaryngeal/Delphian).
*   **Level VII:** [[Superior Mediastinal nodes]].

### Radical Neck Dissection (RND)

**Definition:** En bloc resection of all lymph nodes from **Levels I through V** along with the removal of three key non-lymphatic structures: the [[Sternocleidomastoid muscle]], the [[Internal Jugular Vein]], and the [[Spinal Accessory Nerve]].

#### Structures Removed
1.  **Lymph Nodes:** Levels I to V along with fibrofatty tissue.
2.  **Muscles:** [[Sternocleidomastoid muscle]] (SCM), [[Omohyoid muscle]].
3.  **Vessels:** [[Internal Jugular Vein]] (IJV), [[External Jugular Vein]].
4.  **Nerves:** [[Spinal Accessory Nerve]] (CN XI), sensory branches of [[Cervical Plexus]].
5.  **Glands:** [[Submandibular salivary gland]], Tail of the [[Parotid gland]].

#### Structures Preserved
*   **Arteries:** [[Common Carotid Artery]], [[Internal Carotid Artery]], [[External Carotid Artery]].
*   **Nerves:** [[Vagus nerve]] (CN X), [[Hypoglossal nerve]] (CN XII), [[Phrenic nerve]], [[Lingual nerve]], [[Brachial plexus]], [[Sympathetic chain]].
*   **Others:** [[Digastric muscle]] (usually posterior belly), [[Stylohyoid muscle]].

#### Indications
*   Clinically palpable metastatic lymph nodes (N+ neck) from upper aerodigestive tract carcinoma.
*   Metastasis of unknown origin (MUO) in the neck.
*   Recurrent neck disease after radiation or conservative surgery.

#### Contraindications
*   **Absolute:** Untreatable primary tumor, Distant metastases, Patient unfit for major surgery.
*   **Relative:** Mass fixed to the [[Carotid artery]], [[Brachial plexus]], or deep cervical muscles (prevertebral fascia).

#### Steps of Surgery
1.  **Position:** Supine, neck extended, head rotated to the contralateral side.
2.  **Incision:** Common types include **Modified Gluck-Sorenson**, **Schobinger**, **McFee** (parallel transverse incisions), or **Hockey stick**.
3.  **Flap Elevation:** Subplatysmal flaps raised.
4.  **Dissection:**
    *   Sternocleidomastoid (sternal and clavicular heads) divided inferiorly.
    *   [[Internal Jugular Vein]] ligated and divided inferiorly.
    *   Dissection proceeds superiorly along the carotid sheath (preserving Vagus) and posterior triangle (preserving Phrenic nerve and Brachial Plexus).
    *   Cervical plexus cutaneous branches are sacrificed.
    *   Superiorly, the SCM, IJV, and SAN are divided.
    *   [[Submandibular gland]] is mobilized and removed.

### Modified Radical Neck Dissection (MRND)

**Definition:** A surgical procedure that removes lymph nodes **Levels I through V** (same as RND) but preserves one or more of the non-lymphatic structures (SAN, IJV, SCM) to reduce morbidity.

**Rationale:** Lymph nodes lie in specific fascial planes; careful dissection allows removal of nodes while sparing functional structures without compromising oncological safety in appropriately selected cases.

#### Classification (Types)

| Type | Structures Preserved | AKA |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type I** | **[[Spinal Accessory Nerve]]** | |
| **Type II** | SAN + **[[Internal Jugular Vein]]** | |
| **Type III** | SAN + IJV + **[[Sternocleidomastoid Muscle]]** | **Functional Neck Dissection** (Bocca's) |

*Mnemonic: 1-2-3 (Preserved structures)*
*   **Type 1:** **1** structure saved (Nerve)
*   **Type 2:** **2** structures saved (Nerve + Vein)
*   **Type 3:** **3** structures saved (Nerve + Vein + Muscle)

**Indications:**
*   Clinically positive nodes (N1) that are mobile and not adherent to the SCM or IJV.
*   Elective neck dissection for N0 neck (though Selective Neck Dissection is now more common for N0).

### Extended Radical Neck Dissection
Includes the removal of structures normally preserved in RND (e.g., [[Hypoglossal nerve]], [[Carotid artery]]) or additional lymph node groups (e.g., **Level VI**, **Level VII**, [[Retropharyngeal nodes]]).
*   **Indications:** Disease extending to skull base, mediastinum, or encasing the carotid.

### Comparison of Procedures

| Feature | Radical Neck Dissection (RND) | Modified Radical (MRND) | Selective Neck Dissection (SND) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nodes Removed** | Levels I–V | Levels I–V | Specific Levels (e.g., I-III, II-IV) |
| **Structures Sacrificed** | SCM, IJV, SAN | None (Type III) to Some (Type I/II) | None (usually) |
| **Indication** | Advanced metastatic disease (N+) | N+ (mobile), N0 | N0 (Elective/Prophylactic) |
| **Morbidity** | High (Shoulder drop, cosmetic) | Moderate to Low | Low |

### Complications

#### Immediate / Intraoperative
*   **Hemorrhage:** From [[Carotid artery]] or [[Internal Jugular Vein]].
*   **Air Embolism:** Due to injury of large veins (IJV/subclavian).
*   **Nerve Injury:**
    *   [[Vagus nerve]]: Vocal cord palsy.
    *   [[Phrenic nerve]]: Diaphragmatic paralysis.
    *   [[Hypoglossal nerve]]: Tongue deviation/atrophy.
    *   [[Brachial plexus]]: Upper limb weakness.
    *   [[Marginal mandibular nerve]]: Weakness of lower lip depressors.
*   **Pneumothorax:** Injury to pleura at the root of the neck.

#### Postoperative
*   **Hematoma/Seroma:** Can compress the airway.
*   **Wound Infection/Dehiscence/Flap Necrosis.**
*   **[[Chylous Fistula]]:** Due to injury to the **Thoracic Duct** (mainly on the left side).
    *   *Management:* Pressure dressing, low-fat diet, or surgical ligation if persistent.
*   **Carotid Blowout:** Rupture of the carotid artery (rare but fatal), often associated with salivary fistula or radiation necrosis.
*   **Facial Edema:** Due to bilateral IJV ligation (concurrent bilateral RND is avoided; usually staged 3-4 weeks apart).
*   **Frozen Shoulder:** Due to [[Spinal Accessory Nerve]] sacrifice (shoulder drop, pain, inability to abduct arm >90 degrees).

**Clinical Implication:** In RND, the patient will have significant shoulder dysfunction due to the loss of the trapezius nerve supply (CN XI). Physical therapy is essential. MRND seeks to avoid this "Shoulder Syndrome."
