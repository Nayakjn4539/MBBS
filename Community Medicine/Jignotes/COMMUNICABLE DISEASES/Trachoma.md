# Trachoma

**Trachoma** (also known as "Rough Eye") is a chronic infectious disease of the [[conjunctiva]] and [[cornea]]. It is the leading cause of preventable **infectious blindness** worldwide. While not fatal, it causes immense suffering and disability due to visual impairment,.

### 1. Epidemiological Determinants

#### A. Agent Factors
*   **Causative Agent:** *[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]*.
*   **Serotypes:** The classical endemic blinding trachoma is caused by serotypes **A, B, Ba, and C**,.
*   **Nature:** It is an obligatory intracellular bacterium.
*   **Reservoir:** Children with active disease are the main reservoir. Older children and adults act as chronic carriers.
*   **Infectivity:** Low infectivity. It is infective as long as active lesions are present; not infective after complete cicatrization (scarring).

#### B. Host Factors
*   **Age:** Infection is most common in early childhood. Active disease peaks between **2–5 years** of age.
*   **Sex:** Prevalence is equal in young children, but in adults, **Females** are affected more than males (likely due to closer contact with infected children).
*   **Predisposing Factors:** Application of irritants like **Kajal or Surma** to eyes facilitates transmission.

#### C. Environmental Factors
*   **Vectors:** Eye-seeking flies (e.g., *Musca sorbens*, *Musca domestica*).
*   **Conditions:** Thrives in poverty, overcrowding, poor personal hygiene, lack of water, and dry/dusty climates.
*   **Season:** Epidemics often associate with seasons having high fly density (e.g., rainy season).

### 2. Mode of Transmission
Transmission is often described as **"Eye-to-Eye"**.

*   **Direct Contact:** Contact with ocular or nasal discharge of infected persons.
*   **Indirect Contact (Fomites):** Use of contaminated towels, fingers, handkerchiefs, or bedding.
*   **Vector-Borne:** Mechanical transmission by flies transferring discharge from infected to healthy eyes.

**Mnemonic: The 4 Fs of Transmission**
*   **F**lies
*   **F**ingers
*   **F**omites
*   **F**ace (Discharge)

### 3. Clinical Features and Classification
The [[WHO]] developed a simplified grading system for Trachoma (FISTO) for field surveys,.

| WHO Grade | Definition | Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TF** (Trachomatous inflammation - Follicular) | Presence of **5 or more follicles** (>0.5mm) on the upper tarsal conjunctiva. | Indicates **Active Infection**. |
| **TI** (Trachomatous inflammation - Intense) | Pronounced inflammatory thickening of the upper tarsal conjunctiva that obscures more than **50% of the normal deep tarsal vessels**. | Indicates severe inflammation and high risk of scarring. |
| **TS** (Trachomatous Scarring) | Presence of scarring in the tarsal conjunctiva. | Evidence of past infection; risk of trichiasis. |
| **TT** (Trachomatous Trichiasis) | At least one eyelash rubs on the eyeball. | **Blinding stage**; requires surgery. |
| **CO** (Corneal Opacity) | Easily visible corneal opacity over the pupil. | Causes significant visual impairment/blindness. |

**[[Clinical Relevance]]**: **Herbert's Pits** (healed limbal follicles) are pathognomonic clinical signs of past trachoma infection.

### 4. Field Diagnosis
For field diagnosis in children (0-10 years), at least **two** of the following signs must be present,:
1.  Follicles on upper tarsal conjunctiva.
2.  Limbal follicles or their sequelae (Herbert's Pits).
3.  Typical conjunctival scarring.
4.  Vascular pannus (most marked at superior limbus).

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a diagram of the eye showing the upper eyelid everted. Label 'Follicles' (small bumps), 'Scarring' (white lines), and 'Trichiasis' (eyelashes turning inward touching the cornea)

### 5. Prevention and Control: The SAFE Strategy
The WHO adopted the **[[SAFE Strategy]]** for the global elimination of blinding trachoma,,.

#### **S** - Surgery
*   **Target:** For **Trachomatous Trichiasis (TT)**.
*   **Goal:** To prevent corneal opacity and blindness.
*   **Procedure:** Bilateral Tarsal Rotation is the preferred procedure.

#### **A** - Antibiotics
*   **Target:** To treat active infection and reduce the community reservoir.
*   **Drug of Choice:** **[[Azithromycin]]** (Oral).
    *   *Dose:* **20 mg/kg** body weight (single dose).
    *   *Alternative:* 1% Tetracycline eye ointment (twice daily for 6 weeks).
*   **Mass Treatment Criteria**:
    *   If prevalence of TF in children (1-9 yrs) is **>10%**: Treat the **entire district** (Mass Drug Administration).
    *   If prevalence is **5-10%**: Targeted treatment of family members of identified cases.
    *   If prevalence is **<5%**: Antibiotic distribution not necessary (treat individual cases).

#### **F** - Facial Cleanliness
*   Promoting clean faces in children to remove ocular/nasal discharge.
*   Reduces attraction of eye-seeking flies and direct transmission.

#### **E** - Environmental Improvement
*   Improved water supply (for washing).
*   Basic sanitation (latrines) to reduce fly breeding sites.
*   Fly control measures.

### 6. Public Health Status in India
*   **Status:** India was declared free from **infective trachoma** in **December 2017**.
*   **Survey:** The National Trachoma Survey Report (2014-17) showed the prevalence of active trachoma infection among children was **0.7%** (below the elimination criteria of 5%).
*   **Current Goal:** To eliminate Trachomatous Trichiasis (TT) and prevent recurrence.
