# [[Radiology And Imaging]] > PET Scan

### PET Scan (Positron Emission Tomography)

**[[Positron Emission Tomography]]** (PET) is a specialized nuclear medicine imaging technique that provides functional information about the body's metabolic activity, distinguishing it from anatomical imaging modalities like **[[CT scan]]** or **[[MRI]]**. It is extensively used in oncology, neurology, and cardiology.

#### Principle and Mechanism
Unlike X-rays or CT scans which image anatomy, the **[[PET scan]]** images physiology and function. The fundamental principle relies on the metabolic differences between diseased cells and normal cells.

*   **Tracer Injection:** A radioactive tracer, most commonly **[[Fludeoxyglucose (F18)]]** or **[[FDG]]**, is injected intravenously into the patient.
*   **Biological Mimicry:** [[FDG]] is a glucose molecule tagged with a radioactive isotope. Since tissues utilize glucose for energy, the tracer is absorbed by body cells.
*   **Metabolic Trapping:** Malignant tumors and areas of inflammation have high metabolic rates and consume more glucose than normal tissues. Consequently, they accumulate higher concentrations of **[[FDG]]**.
*   **Image Formation:** As the radioactive tracer breaks down, it emits **[[positrons]]**. These positrons interact with electrons to emit **[[gamma rays]]**, which are detected by the scanner to reconstruct a 3D color image.

#### PET-CT Fusion
Modern **[[PET scanners]]** are often combined with **[[Computed Tomography]]** (CT) in a single gantry. This allows for the simultaneous acquisition of functional data (PET) and anatomical data (CT).
*   **Advantage:** The metabolic "hot spots" lighted up by the **[[PET scan]]** are precisely localized anatomically by the **[[CT scan]]** images.
*   **Output:** This results in a fused image that provides high diagnostic accuracy.

#### Clinical Applications in Orthopedics
While **[[MRI]]** is the gold standard for local staging, **[[PET scan]]** plays a crucial role in systemic evaluation.

**1. Bone Tumors and Oncology**
*   **Diagnosis and Staging:** It is highly effective in detecting metastasis in both bone and soft tissue structures. It aids in the staging of malignancies like **[[Osteosarcoma]]**, **[[Ewing's sarcoma]]**, and **[[Chondrosarcoma]]**.
*   **Skip Lesions:** It helps identify **[[skip lesions]]** (tumors in the same bone but separated from the primary mass) which might be missed by other modalities.
*   **Metastasis Detection:** It is used to detect distant soft tissue metastasis and skeletal metastasis. In **[[Multiple Myeloma]]**, **[[FDG PET scan]]** is used to determine distant soft tissue involvement.
*   **Treatment Evaluation:** It is unique in its ability to evaluate the response to treatment (e.g., **[[neoadjuvant chemotherapy]]**). A reduction in metabolic activity (diminished "glow" on the scan) indicates the tumor is responding to therapy, even if the tumor mass hasn't significantly shrunk in size.

**2. Infection**
*   **[[Chronic Osteomyelitis]]**: Can help differentiate between active infection and quiescent bone changes, although it is non-specific (can light up for both tumor and infection).
*   **Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO)**: Helps localize occult sources of infection or inflammation.

#### Advantages and Limitations

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Functional Imaging** | Detects cellular metabolic changes often before anatomical changes are visible on **[[X-ray]]** or **[[CT scan]]**. |
| **Whole Body Scan** | Can screen the entire body for metastasis in a single session. |
| **Cost** | A major disadvantage. It is approximately 5 times more expensive than an **[[MRI]]** and 8 times more expensive than a **[[Technetium 99m bone scan]]**. |
| **Specificity** | While sensitive, it can be non-specific; inflammation and infection also uptake glucose and can mimic cancer. |

#### Comparison with Other Modalities

*   **vs. [[MRI]]**: MRI provides superior soft-tissue contrast and anatomical detail (structure). PET provides metabolic activity (function). MRI is better for local defining of a tumor; PET is better for systemic staging.
*   **vs. [[Bone Scan]]**: Traditional bone scans use **[[Technetium 99m]]** and detect osteoblastic activity (bone formation). PET scans using **[[FDG]]** detect glucose metabolism.
    *   *Clinical Implication:* A byproduct of **[[FDG]]**, specifically **[[Fluorine-18]]** ([[F18]]), can be used for bone scans to reduce costs compared to a full **[[FDG PET scan]]**.

#### Clinical Implications
*   **Early Diagnosis:** Because metabolic changes precede anatomical structural changes, **[[PET scan]]** can diagnose disease relapse or recurrence earlier than **[[CT]]** or **[[MRI]]**.
*   **Biopsy Guidance:** It can guide the surgeon to the most metabolically active part of a tumor for **[[biopsy]]**, ensuring a representative sample is taken rather than necrotic tissue.

**Mnemonic for PET Indications:** **"PETS"**
*   **P** - **P**hysiological/Functional imaging (Metabolism)
*   **E** - **E**valuation of Treatment response
*   **T** - **T**umor staging (Metastasis/Skip lesions)
*   **S** - **S**ystemic screening
