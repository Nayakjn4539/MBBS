# Diseases of the Orbit: Preseptal vs. Orbital Cellulitis

## 1. Applied Anatomy: The Orbital Septum
The [[Orbital Septum]] is the key anatomical landmark distinguishing these two conditions.
*   It is a fascial layer formed by the periosteum of the orbital margin.
*   It acts as a barrier.
*   **Pre-septal space:** The area anterior to the orbital septum (subcutaneous tissues of eyelids).
*   **Post-septal space:** The area behind the orbital septum (the orbit proper),,.

## 2. Preseptal Cellulitis (Periorbital Cellulitis)
**Definition:** Infection of the subcutaneous tissues anterior to the [[Orbital Septum]]. Strictly speaking, it is not an orbital disease but is included because facial veins are valveless, allowing spread posteriorly to produce orbital cellulitis,.

### Etiology
*   **Causative Organisms:**
    *   *Staphylococcus aureus*.
    *   *Streptococcus pyogenes*.
    *   *Haemophilus influenzae* (occasionally).
*   **Modes of Infection:**
    1.  **Exogenous:** Skin lacerations, insect bites, eyelid operations.
    2.  **Local Extension:** From acute [[Hordeolum]] (stye) or acute [[Dacryocystitis]].
    3.  **Endogenous:** Hematogenous spread from middle ear or upper respiratory tract infections.

### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:** Painful acute periorbital swelling.
*   **Signs:**
    *   Erythema and hyperaemia of the lids.
    *   Fever and leukocytosis may be associated.
    *   **Crucial Negative Signs:**
        *   **Proptosis is absent.**
        *   **Ocular movements are normal.**
        *   Visual acuity is **normal**.
        *   Conjunctiva is usually not congested.

### Management
*   **Mild-to-moderate cases:** Oral antibiotics (co-amoxiclav or flucloxacillin).
*   **Severe cases:** Hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics (e.g., ceftriaxone).
*   **Supportive:** Systemic analgesics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and warm compresses.
*   **Surgical:** Exploration/debridement only if a fluctuant mass/abscess is present or a retained foreign body is suspected.

## 3. Orbital Cellulitis
**Definition:** An acute infection of the soft tissues of the orbit **behind** the [[Orbital Septum]]. It is an ocular emergency,,.

### Etiology
*   **Modes of Infection:**
    1.  **Extension from neighbouring structures (Most Common):**
        *   **Paranasal Sinusitis:** Especially **[[Ethmoid Sinusitis]]** (commonest cause due to the thin lamina papyracea of the medial wall),,.
        *   Teeth, face, and intracranial cavity.
    2.  **Exogenous:** Penetrating injuries, intraorbital foreign bodies, or following surgeries (evisceration, dacryocystectomy),.
    3.  **Endogenous:** Metastatic infection from breast abscess, thrombophlebitis, or septicemia,.
*   **Causative Organisms:** *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Streptococcus pyogenes*, and *Haemophilus influenzae*,.

### Clinical Features
**Symptoms:**
*   Severe pain (increased by movement of the eyeball or pressure).
*   Swelling.
*   General symptoms: Fever, nausea, vomiting, prostration.
*   Vision loss/diplopia (in moderate to advanced disease).

**Signs:**
*   **Lid Swelling:** Woody hardness and redness.
*   **Chemosis:** Swelling of the conjunctiva, which may protrude and become necrotic,.
*   **Proptosis:** Axial proptosis of varying degrees,.
*   **Ophthalmoplegia:** Restriction of ocular movements (painful),.
*   **Visual Impairment:** May have [[Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect]] (RAPD) due to optic neuropathy or central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO).
*   **Fundus:** May show congestion of retinal veins, papillitis, or papilledema.

### Complications
1.  **Ocular:** Exposure keratopathy, [[Optic Neuritis]], CRAO causing blindness,.
2.  **Orbital:** Progression to **Subperiosteal Abscess** (collection between bony wall and periosteum) or **Orbital Abscess** (pus within orbital soft tissue),.
3.  **Intracranial:** [[Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis]], meningitis, brain abscess,.
4.  **Systemic:** Septicemia or pyemia.

### Investigations
*   **Imaging (CT Scan/MRI):**
    *   To differentiate preseptal from postseptal (orbital) cellulitis.
    *   To detect subperiosteal or orbital abscesses.
    *   To detect intracranial extension.
*   **Labs:** Complete hemogram (leukocytosis), blood cultures, nasal/conjunctival swabs.
*   **X-ray PNS:** To identify associated sinusitis.

### Treatment
**Medical Management (Aggressive):**
*   **Admission:** Mandatory hospitalization.
*   **Intravenous Antibiotics:**
    *   High doses of penicillinase-resistant antibiotics (e.g., oxacillin) + Ampicillin.
    *   Alternatives: Cefotaxime, Ciprofloxacin, or Vancomycin.
    *   For *H. influenzae* (children): Add Chloramphenicol or Clavulanic acid.
    *   For Anaerobes: Add Metronidazole.
*   **Supportive:** Analgesics, anti-inflammatories, nasal decongestant drops, and topical antibiotic eye ointment for corneal exposure,.

**Surgical Intervention:**
*   **Indications:**
    1.  Unresponsiveness to antibiotics.
    2.  Decrease in vision.
    3.  Presence of orbital or subperiosteal abscess.
*   **Procedures:** Drainage of abscess, drainage of infected sinuses, or immediate canthotomy/cantholysis if the orbit is tight.

## 4. Comparison: Preseptal vs. Orbital Cellulitis vs. Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis

| Feature | Preseptal Cellulitis | Orbital Cellulitis | Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis (CST) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Anatomical Site** | Anterior to Orbital Septum | Posterior to Orbital Septum | Cavernous Sinus |
| **Laterality** | Unilateral | Unilateral | Starts Unilateral, becomes **Bilateral** (>50%), |
| **Proptosis** | **Absent** | **Marked**, | Moderate |
| **Ocular Movements** | **Normal** | **Painful & Limited**, | **Complete Limitation** (Early III, IV, VI palsy), |
| **Vision** | Normal | May be affected | Not affected in early stage |
| **Pupil** | Normal | RAPD may be present | Dilated & Fixed (Internal ophthalmoplegia) |
| **Systemic Signs** | Mild Fever | Fever, Prostration | Severe Prostration, Rigors, Vomiting |
| **Mastoid Edema** | Absent | Absent | **Present**, |
| **Corneal Sensation** | Normal | Normal/Decreased | Decreased/Absent (CN V involvement) |

**Clinical Implication:** The presence of proptosis, ophthalmoplegia (restricted movement), or pain on eye movement confirms **Orbital Cellulitis** and rules out Preseptal Cellulitis,. Bilaterality and mastoid edema strongly suggest **CST** over Orbital Cellulitis.

## 5. Orbital Mucormycosis
*   **Context:** Often seen in diabetic ketoacidosis or immunocompromised patients.
*   **Pathology:** Fungal infection (*Mucor* or *Rhizopus*) invading vessels causing ischemic necrosis.
*   **Signs:** Proptosis, pain, and **black eschar** formation on the palate, nasal septum, or eyelid skin,.
*   **Treatment:** Correction of metabolic defect, surgical excision (debridement/exenteration), IV Amphotericin B,.
