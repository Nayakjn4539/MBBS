# [[Agricultural Poisons]] > Aluminium Phosphide

### Aluminium Phosphide (Celphos)

**Aluminium Phosphide** (AlP) is a solid fumigant pesticide, widely used as a grain preservative (wheat, rice) in Northern India. It is currently one of the most common suicidal poisons in India due to its low cost, easy availability, and high toxicity.

**Common Trade Names:** Celphos, Alphos, Quickphos, Phosfume.

#### Physical Properties
*   **Appearance:** Available as greenish-grey or dark brown tablets (3g each) or pellets.
*   **Composition:** Each 3g tablet contains 56% Aluminium Phosphide and 44% Carbamate/Ammonium Carbonate.
    *   *Note:* Ammonium carbonate releases **Ammonia** and $CO_2$ to prevent spontaneous combustion/explosion of the gas.
*   **Smell:** Typical [[Garlic]] or **Decaying Fish** odour due to impurities (acetylene/diphosphines). Pure phosphine is odourless.

#### Mechanism of Action
When AlP comes in contact with moisture (in air) or Hydrochloric acid (in the stomach), it liberates **[[Phosphine]] gas ($PH_3$)**.

**Chemical Reaction:**
$AlP + 3HCl \rightarrow AlCl_3 + PH_3 \uparrow$
$AlP + 3H_2O \rightarrow Al(OH)_3 + PH_3 \uparrow$

**Pathophysiology:**
1.  **Cytotoxic Action:** Phosphine is a protoplasmic poison. It inhibits **[[Cytochrome c oxidase]]** (Complex IV) in the mitochondrial electron transport chain.
2.  **Energy Crisis:** This leads to inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation $\rightarrow$ Cellular hypoxia $\rightarrow$ Anaerobic metabolism $\rightarrow$ Lactic acidosis.
3.  **Free Radical Injury:** Induction of oxidative stress and free radicals (Superoxide dismutase inhibition).
4.  **Target Organs:** Heart (Toxic myocarditis), Lungs, and Blood vessels.

#### Fatal Dose and Period
*   **Fatal Dose:** 1 to 3 tablets (approx. 1.5 to 3 grams). Ingestion of even 0.5g can be fatal.
*   **Fatal Period:** Usually **12 to 24 hours**. Most deaths occur within the first 24 hours due to cardiac arrhythmias or shock.

#### Clinical Features
Symptoms usually appear within 15-30 minutes of ingestion.

**1. Gastrointestinal (Early Signs):**
*   Severe burning pain in epigastrium (retrosternal burning).
*   Recurrent vomiting (vomitus smells of garlic).
*   Thirst and salivation.

**2. Cardiovascular (Major cause of death):**
*   **Refractory [[Hypotension]]/Shock:** Unresponsive to fluids (Cardinal sign).
*   **Toxic Myocarditis:** Chest pain, palpitations.
*   **ECG Changes:** ST-T changes, bundle branch blocks, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation.

**3. Respiratory:**
*   Tachypnoea, Dyspnoea.
*   **ARDS** (Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome).
*   Pulmonary edema.

**4. Metabolic:**
*   Severe **[[Metabolic Acidosis]]** (Lactic acidosis).
*   Hypomagnesemia.
*   Hypokalemia.

**5. CNS:**
*   Headache, dizziness, paresthesia.
*   Alert sensorium initially $\rightarrow$ Drowsiness $\rightarrow$ [[Coma]].

**Mnemonic for Symptoms: PHOS**phine
*   **P** - Pulmonary Edema / Pain (Epigastric)
*   **H** - Hypotension (Refractory Shock)
*   **O** - Odour (Garlic/Decaying Fish)
*   **S** - Sensorium altered (Late stage) / Severe Acidosis

#### Diagnosis (Bedside Test)
**Silver Nitrate Test:**
1.  Take 5 ml of gastric aspirate in a test tube.
2.  Place a filter paper impregnated with 0.1 N [[Silver Nitrate]] over the mouth of the test tube.
3.  Heat the tube gently at 50°C for 15-20 minutes.
4.  **Result:** If Phosphine is present, the paper turns **Black** (due to reduction of silver nitrate to metallic silver).

#### Treatment
There is **NO specific antidote**. Management is aggressive and supportive.

**1. Resuscitation (Stabilization):**
*   Secure Airway, Breathing, and Circulation (ABC).
*   Treat [[Shock]] aggressively with IV fluids (Normal Saline).
*   **Vasopressors:** Start Dopamine or Noradrenaline early if hypotension persists.

**2. Decontamination:**
*   **Gastric Lavage:**
    *   Use **[[Potassium Permanganate]]** (1:10,000) or Potassium Permanganate + Sodium Bicarbonate. This oxidizes toxic phosphine to non-toxic phosphate.
    *   **Coconut Oil / Liquid Paraffin:** Lavage with oil or leaving oil in the stomach helps inhibit phosphine release and reduces absorption (physiochemical barrier).
    *   *Warning:* **Avoid plain water** for lavage as it accelerates phosphine production.

**3. Specific/Adjuvant Therapy:**
*   **[[Magnesium Sulphate]]:** Used to manage arrhythmias and stabilize cell membranes (combat free radical damage).
    *   *Dose:* 1g IV stat, followed by 1g IV every hour for 3 hours, then 1g every 6 hours for 5-7 days.
*   **Acidosis Correction:** IV Sodium Bicarbonate for severe metabolic acidosis.
*   **N-Acetylcysteine:** Antioxidant role.

#### Autopsy Findings
**External:**
*   **Garlic Odour** from mouth and nose (highly characteristic).
*   Cyanosis of lips and fingertips.
*   Blood-stained froth at mouth/nose.

**Internal:**
*   **Stomach:** Mucosa is congested, hemorrhagic, and may show shedding. Contents are greyish-brown with intense garlic odour.
*   **Lungs:** Congested, edematous (heavy).
*   **Viscera:** Generalized congestion of liver, spleen, kidneys.
*   **Blood:** May be cherry-red (due to inhibition of cytochrome oxidase preventing oxygen uptake by tissues) or dark fluid.

**Viscera Preservation:**
*   Preserve stomach and contents in **Saturated Solution of Common Salt (Saline)**.
*   **Do NOT use acidic preservatives** (like Rectified Spirit/Formalin) as they enhance phosphine release or interfere with analysis.

#### Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Suicidal:** Very common ("Ideal Suicidal Poison" in rural North India) due to easy availability and lack of antidote.
*   **Accidental:** Possible in workers during fumigation (inhalation) or children mistaking tablets for candy.
*   **Homicidal:** Rare due to strong smell and taste.
