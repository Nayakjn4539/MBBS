# [[Surgeries In Ophthalmology]] > Incision and Drainage of Lacrimal Abscess

### Incision and Drainage of Lacrimal Abscess

**Lacrimal abscess** is a complication of [[acute dacryocystitis]] where the [[lacrimal sac]] fills with pus, distends, and the anterior wall ruptures, forming a pericystic swelling.

### Indications
*   **Acute Dacryocystitis:** specifically in the **Stage of Lacrimal Abscess**.
*   **Clinical Sign:** When the abscess becomes fluctuant and starts **pointing** on the skin.
    *   *Note:* Attempting incision during the stage of cellulitis (hard, tender swelling) is contraindicated as it may spread infection.

### Surgical Anatomy and Pointing
*   The [[lacrimal sac]] is covered anteriorly by the [[medial palpebral ligament]] (MPL).
*   The abscess usually points **below and to the outer side** of the sac.
*   **Reason:** Gravitation of pus and the resistance offered by the [[medial palpebral ligament]] in the upper part prevent upward extension.

### Instrumentation
The following instruments are essential for this procedure:

| Instrument | Description & Function in Procedure |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Scalpel Handle]]** | Typically a **Bard-Parker handle** (No. 3 or similar). It holds the surgical blade (usually No. 11 or 15) required to make the initial skin incision over the pointing abscess. |
| **[[Artery Forceps]]** | Also known as a **hemostat** (e.g., Mosquito forceps). <br>1. Used to clamp bleeding vessels for hemostasis. <br>2. Used for blunt dissection: inserted closed into the incision and opened to break loculi within the abscess cavity. <br>3. Used to hold gauze pieces for packing/dressing. |
| **[[Plain Dissecting Forceps]]** | Simple forceps without teeth (serrated tips). Used to hold and stabilize the skin or tissue margins during the incision and dressing. |

### Surgical Procedure

**1. Anesthesia**
*   **General Anaesthesia:** Preferred for children or uncooperative patients.
*   **Local Anaesthesia:** Regional block or local infiltration can be used in adults, though infiltration into an inflamed area is painful and less effective due to acidic pH of pus. Surface anesthesia (topical) is generally insufficient.

**2. Incision**
*   The site of maximum fluctuation/pointing is identified (usually below the MPL).
*   A small, vertical or slightly curved incision is made using the **[[scalpel handle]]** with the blade, cutting through the skin and orbicularis muscle to reach the abscess cavity.

**3. Drainage**
*   Pus is allowed to drain spontaneously.
*   **[[Artery forceps]]** may be inserted to break any internal loculi (septae) to ensure complete evacuation of the purulent material.
*   Gentle pressure is applied to squeeze out the remaining pus.

**4. Dressing**
*   The cavity is cleaned.
*   A small ribbon gauze soaked in **betadine** (povidone-iodine) or antibiotic solution is packed into the cavity using **[[artery forceps]]** or a probe to keep the wound open for drainage and allow healing by secondary intention.
*   A sterile eye pad and bandage are applied.

### Post-Operative Management
1.  **Daily Dressing:** The gauge packing is changed daily until the discharge ceases and the wound starts granulating from the base.
2.  **Systemic Antibiotics:** To control residual infection and prevent spread (e.g., [[orbital cellulitis]]).
3.  **Anti-inflammatory drugs:** To reduce pain and swelling.
4.  **Hot Fomentation:** To aid resolution.

### Clinical Implications and Sequelae
*   **[[Lacrimal Fistula]]:** Spontaneous rupture or surgical drainage often leads to the formation of an external lacrimal fistula.
*   **Definitive Treatment:** I&D is a temporary measure to relieve acute pain and pressure. Once the acute inflammation subsides and the fistula heals (or persists), definitive surgery is required to treat the underlying cause (obstruction of the [[nasolacrimal duct]]).
    *   **[[Dacryocystorhinostomy]] (DCR):** The operation of choice to re-establish drainage.
    *   **[[Dacryocystectomy]] (DCT):** Removal of the sac, indicated if DCR is contraindicated (e.g., in elderly patients or fibrosed sacs).

### Mnemonic for Management of Acute Dacryocystitis
**"Hot PAD"**
*   **Hot** fomentation
*   **P**enicillin (Systemic Antibiotics)
*   **A**nalgesics
*   **D**rainage (Incision and Drainage when pointing)
