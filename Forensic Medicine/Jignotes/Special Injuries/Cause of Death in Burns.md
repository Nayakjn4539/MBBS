# [[Special Injuries]] > Cause of Death in Burns

### Cause of Death in Burns

The cause of death in burn cases depends on the **degree** of heat, the **duration** of exposure, the **extent** of the body surface area involved, and the **site** of the burns. Causes are classified chronologically based on the time elapsed between the injury and death.

### 1. Immediate Causes (Instantaneous or within 24 hours)

These usually occur at the scene of the fire or shortly after admission.

*   **Neurogenic Shock (Primary Shock):** Caused by intense pain and fright resulting from extensive stimulation of sensory nerve endings. It leads to peripheral circulatory failure.
*   **Asphyxia:** This is a very common cause of rapid death. It occurs due to:
    *   Inhalation of smoke and irrespirable gases like [[Carbon Monoxide]] (CO) and [[Carbon Dioxide]] (CO2). CO poisoning is significant if levels exceed 50%.
    *   Inhalation of toxic fumes like [[Hydrogen Cyanide]] (from burning plastics/polyurethane).
    *   **Laryngeal Edema:** Inhalation of hot gases/smoke causes acute edema of the glottis, leading to mechanical obstruction of the airway.
    *   Mechanical asphyxia due to falling masonry or stampede (in building fires).
*   **Blast Injuries:** If the fire is associated with an explosion, death may result from primary blast waves affecting lungs or hollow viscera.

### 2. Delayed Causes (24 to 48 hours)

*   **Hypovolemic Shock (Secondary Shock):** This is the most common cause of death in the early period (approx. 50% of deaths). It results from:
    *   Massive loss of fluid and plasma from the burnt surface (exudation).
    *   Increased capillary permeability leading to edema and hemoconcentration.
*   **Toxaemia:** Absorption of toxic products from necrotic/charred tissues and destruction of proteins.
*   **Acute Renal Failure:** Caused by:
    *   Hypovolemia and hypotension (prerenal failure).
    *   [[Myoglobinuria]] (from muscle destruction/rhabdomyolysis) and hemoglobinuria blocking renal tubules.

### 3. Remote/Late Causes (> 48 hours to weeks)

*   **Sepsis (Septicemia):** This is the leading cause of late death. The raw burnt surface acts as a culture medium for bacteria (commonly *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, *Staphylococcus aureus*).
    *   It can lead to bronchopneumonia, pyemia, or meningitis.
*   **Curling's Ulcer:** Acute duodenal ulcers occurring about the 10th day due to stress and mucosal ischemia. They may perforate or cause severe hematemesis.
*   **Pulmonary Complications:**
    *   [[ARDS]] (Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome) or "Shock Lung".
    *   Pulmonary embolism (from prolonged immobilization).
*   **Exhaustion:** Due to prolonged suppuration, hypoproteinemia, anemia, and metabolic strain.

### Classification of Cause of Death (Summary Table)

| Time Since Injury | Primary Cause | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0 – 24 Hours** | **Asphyxia & Neurogenic Shock** | CO poisoning, Laryngeal edema, Vagal inhibition due to pain. |
| **24 – 48 Hours** | **Hypovolemic Shock** | Fluid loss (plasma), Electrolyte imbalance, Toxemia. |
| **> 48 Hours** | **Sepsis & Organ Failure** | Septicemia, Pneumonia, Renal Failure, Curling's Ulcer. |

**Mnemonic:** **SHOCKING**
*   **S** - **S**hock (Neurogenic & Hypovolemic)
*   **H** - **H**ypoxia (Asphyxia, CO)
*   **O** - **O**edema of Glottis
*   **C** - **C**yanide/Carbon Monoxide poisoning
*   **K** - **K**idney failure (Renal tubular necrosis)
*   **I** - **I**nfection (Sepsis/Pneumonia)
*   **N** - **N**ecrosis/Toxaemia
*   **G** - **G**astric/Duodenal Ulcer ([[Curling's Ulcer]])

### Autopsy Findings Relevant to Cause of Death

**External Findings:**
*   **[[Pugilistic Attitude]]:** Heat stiffening causes flexion of limbs (boxer’s pose) due to coagulation of muscle proteins. It occurs in both antemortem and postmortem burns.
*   **Heat Ruptures:** Splits in skin resembling lacerations or incised wounds caused by tissue contraction.
*   **Extent of Burns:** Determine percentage using **Rule of Nines**. Burns >50% are usually fatal.

**Internal Findings:**
*   **Respiratory System:**
    *   Presence of **soot/carbon particles** in trachea and bronchi (vital sign of antemortem inhalation).
    *   Congested, edematous lungs; laryngeal edema.
*   **Blood:**
    *   **Cherry-red** discoloration suggests [[Carboxyhemoglobin]] (COHb) > 30%, indicating the victim was alive during the fire.
*   **Gastrointestinal:**
    *   Mucosa may be congested; look for **Curling's ulcers** in duodenum in delayed deaths.
*   **Kidneys:**
    *    swollen, showing signs of acute tubular necrosis or infarction.

### Medicolegal Aspects
*   Most deaths are **Accidental** (domestic fires, kerosene stove bursts).
*   **Suicidal** burns are common in India (especially involving dowry deaths/bride burning).
*   **Homicidal** burns are rare but can occur to conceal a crime (postmortem burning).
*   Presence of soot in airways and CO in blood confirms **[[Antemortem Burns]]**.
