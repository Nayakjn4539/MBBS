# [[NUTRITION AND HEALTH]] > Many children are reported to be suffering from severe acute malnutrition in a rural block. Briefly mention the steps that can be taken for screening and management of these cases.

### Screening for Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM)

Screening in a rural block is primarily carried out by frontline workers like [[Anganwadi workers]] (AWWs) and [[ASHAs]] through active case finding in the community and at Anganwadi centers.

**Diagnostic Criteria for SAM**
A child (6 months – 5 years) is classified as having SAM if they meet **any one** of the following criteria:

| Indicator | Cut-off / Clinical Sign |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Visible Severe Wasting** | Muscle wasting in gluteal region, loss of subcutaneous fat, prominence of bony structures (thorax). |
| **[[Mid-Upper Arm Circumference]] (MUAC)** | **< 11.5 cm** (or < 115 mm) using a non-stretchable tape ([[Shakir's tape]]). |
| **Weight-for-Height/Length** | **< -3 SD** (Z-score) of the WHO Child Growth Standards. |
| **Edema** | Presence of **[[Bilateral Pitting Edema]]** of nutritional origin. |

**Steps for Screening:**
1.  **Door-to-door surveys:** ASHA/AWWs visit households to measure MUAC and look for edema.
2.  **Growth Monitoring:** Regular weighing at Anganwadi centers (plotting on [[Growth Chart]]).
3.  **Appetite Test:** Once identified, children are tested to see if they can eat [[Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food]] (RUTF). This determines if they need facility-based or community-based care.

### Management of SAM Cases

The management depends on whether the child has medical complications or has a poor appetite.

#### 1. Facility-Based Management (Complicated SAM)
Children with **medical complications** (e.g., severe anemia, pneumonia, unconsciousness), **bilateral pitting edema**, or **poor appetite** (failed appetite test) must be referred to a [[Nutritional Rehabilitation Centre]] (NRC).

**Clinical Relevance:** Immediate hospitalization is crucial because the mortality risk in untreated complicated SAM is 9 times higher than in well-nourished children.

**Phases of Management at NRC:**

*   **Phase I: Stabilization (Days 1–2):**
    *   Life-saving measures are taken to correct acute medical conditions.
    *   **Diet:** **[[F-75]]** (Starter diet: 75 kcal/100ml, low protein 0.9g) is given to prevent metabolic stress.
    *   **Management Protocols (Mnemonic: SHIELDED):**
        *   **S** – Prevent/Treat **Sugar** deficiency ([[Hypoglycemia]])
        *   **H** – Prevent/Treat **Hypothermia**
        *   **I** – Treat **Infection** (Antibiotics)
        *   **EL** – Correct **Electrolyte** imbalance (Potassium/Magnesium; *Do not give high sodium*)
        *   **DE** – Correct **Dehydration** (Use ReSoMal – low sodium ORS)
        *   **D** – Correct **Deficiencies** of micronutrients (Vit A, Folic acid, Zinc, Copper; *Do not give Iron in this phase*)

*   **Phase II: Transition (Days 3–7):**
    *   Started when the child has regained appetite, edema has reduced, and no IV fluids are needed.
    *   **Diet:** Gradual introduction of **[[F-100]]** (Catch-up diet: 100 kcal/100ml, higher protein).
    *   Goal is to prepare the child for rapid weight gain.

*   **Phase III: Rehabilitation (Week 2–6):**
    *   **Diet:** Unlimited amounts of **F-100** or energy-dense home-cooked food.
    *   **Iron supplementation** is started in this phase.
    *   **Sensory Stimulation:** Emotional support and play therapy (Tender Loving Care).
    *   **Discharge Criteria:** Child is alert, eating well, edema has resolved, and weight gain is satisfactory (e.g., 15% weight gain).

#### 2. Community-Based Management (Uncomplicated SAM)
Children **without** medical complications who have a **good appetite** can be managed at home.
*   **Nutrition:** Provision of energy-dense food or [[Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food]] (RUTF) provided by the health system.
*   **Medication:** Oral antibiotics (if required), deworming, and micronutrient supplementation (Vitamin A, Folic acid).
*   **Counselling:** Mother is educated on proper feeding practices, hygiene, and energy-dense home foods (e.g., Khichdi with extra oil/ghee).

#### 3. Follow-up
*   Children discharged from NRCs are prioritized for home visits by ASHA/AWW.
*   **Schedule:** Weekly for the first 4 weeks, then once every 2 weeks until discharged from the program.
*   Monitoring of weight gain and adherence to dietary advice is essential to prevent relapse.
