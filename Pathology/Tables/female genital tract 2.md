| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Transitional Cell Tumors (Brenner Tumors)** Ovarian tumors containing neoplastic epithelial cells resembling urothelium. They are usually benign. | - | - | - | - | May be solid or cystic, usually unilateral (approx. 90%). Vary in size from <1 cm to massive tumors (20-30 cm). The fibrous stroma is marked by sharply demarcated nests of epithelial cells. | Nests of epithelial cells resembling the epithelium of the urinary tract, often with mucinous glands in their center. Stroma is composed of fibrous tissue resembling normal ovary; infrequently, it consists of plump fibroblasts resembling theca cells (and may be hormonally active). | Often detected incidentally. Even when large, they behave in a benign fashion. Malignant Brenner tumors generally present in stage 1. | - | **Benign Brenner tumor** (most common). **Borderline and Malignant counterparts** have been reported. **Malignant Brenner tumors:** Benign nests admixed with malignant tumor cells. **Transitional cell carcinomas of the ovary:** >50% malignant transitional type epithelium; considered equivalent to high-grade (type II) ovarian carcinomas. | Rarely may have hormonal activity. | Benign lesions are easily resected and cured. |
| **Germ Cell Tumors** Tumors constituting 15% to 20% of all ovarian tumors, arising from pluripotent germ cells. | Arise from germ cells that migrate to the ovary from the yolk sac. | Found principally in children and young adults. | Germ cells are pluripotent and can differentiate along various lines: toward oogonia (dysgerminoma), extra-embryonic yolk sac (yolk sac tumors), placenta (choriocarcinoma), or multiple germ layers (teratoma). | - | - | Bear a high degree of morphologic and molecular similarity to germ cell tumors of the male testis. | Most are benign cystic teratomas. Malignant forms are more common in children and young adults. | - | Includes: Teratoma (mature, immature, monodermal), Dysgerminoma, Yolk Sac Tumor, Choriocarcinoma, Mixed germ cell tumors. | - | - |
| **Teratoma** A germ cell tumor composed of tissues from multiple germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm). | Most arise from an ovum after the first meiotic division. The karyotype of almost all benign ovarian teratomas is 46,XX. | **Mature:** Young women.  **Immature:** Prepubertal adolescents and young women (mean age 18 years). | - | - | **Mature (Benign) Cystic Teratoma (Dermoid Cyst):** Bilateral in 10-15%. Usually a unilocular cyst containing hair and sebaceous material. Sectioning reveals a thin wall, often with tooth structures and areas of calcification. **Immature (Malignant) Teratoma:** Bulky, smooth external surface, and tend to be solid on sectioning. May contain hair, cartilage, bone, calcification, with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage. | **Mature (Benign) Teratoma:** Cyst wall is composed of stratified squamous epithelium with underlying sebaceous glands, hair shafts, and other skin adnexal structures. Tissues from other germ layers (cartilage, bone, thyroid, neural tissue) can be identified. **Immature (Malignant) Teratoma:** Contains varying amounts of immature tissue resembling embryonal and fetal tissue, most importantly immature neuroepithelium. Grading (I to III) is based on the proportion of immature neuroepithelium. | **Mature:** May be discovered incidentally. Occasionally associated with paraneoplastic syndromes like inflammatory limbic encephalitis. **Immature:** Grow rapidly. | - | **1. Mature (benign):** e.g., Dermoid cyst.  **2. Immature (malignant).** **3. Monodermal or specialized:** e.g., **Struma ovarii** (thyroid tissue, can cause hyperthyroidism), and **Carcinoid** (arises from intestinal tissue, can cause **carcinoid syndrome**). | **Mature:** 1% undergo malignant transformation (most commonly to squamous cell carcinoma). **Immature:** Frequently penetrate the capsule and spread locally or distantly. | **Immature Teratomas:** Stage I low-grade tumors have an excellent prognosis. Higher-grade tumors are treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Most recurrences develop in the first 2 years. |
| **Dysgerminoma** The ovarian counterpart of testicular seminoma, accounting for about 50% of malignant ovarian germ cell tumors. | - | Occurs in childhood, but 75% in the second and third decades. Some occur in patients with gonadal dysgenesis. | - | Expresses stem cell markers: **OCT3, OCT4, NANOG**. Expresses receptor tyrosine kinase **KIT**; approximately one-third have activating mutations in the **KIT** gene. | 80-90% are unilateral. Range from barely visible nodules to masses filling the abdomen. Cut surface is solid, yellow-white to gray-pink, often soft and fleshy. | Composed of large vesicular cells with clear cytoplasm, well-defined cell boundaries, and centrally placed regular nuclei. Cells grow in sheets or cords separated by scant fibrous stroma, which is infiltrated by lymphocytes and may contain noncaseating granulomas. | Most have no endocrine function. Presents with abdominal pain and a rapidly growing pelvic mass involving a single ovary. | A few produce elevated levels of chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). OCT3, OCT4, NANOG, and KIT are useful diagnostic markers. | - | All are malignant, but degree of atypia is variable, and only about one-third are aggressive. | Responsive to chemotherapy. A unilateral tumor that has not spread has a >96% cure rate with salpingo-oophorectomy. Overall survival exceeds 80%. |
| **Yolk Sac Tumors** Also known as endodermal sinus tumor, it is the second most common malignant ovarian germ cell tumor, derived from malignant germ cells differentiating along the yolk sac lineage. | Derived from malignant germ cells differentiating along the extraembryonic yolk sac lineage. | Affects children or young women. | - | - | - | Characteristic histologic feature is a glomerulus-like structure called a **Schiller-Duval body**, composed of a central blood vessel enveloped by tumor cells within a space also lined by tumor cells. Conspicuous intracellular and extracellular hyaline droplets are present. Immunoperoxidase for α-fetoprotein can be used for identification. | Presents with abdominal pain and a rapidly growing pelvic mass involving a single ovary. | Tumor cells elaborate **α-fetoprotein (AFP)**. | - | - | With combination chemotherapy, there is greater than 80% survival, independent of disease stage. |
| **Choriocarcinoma (Ovarian Germ Cell)** A rare, aggressive malignant germ cell tumor exhibiting extraembryonic (placental) differentiation that arises in the ovary. | Nongestational; develops from germ cells in the ovaries or mediastinum. These tumors can be distinguished from gestational choriocarcinoma by the absence of paternally derived DNA. | - | Aggressive tumors that have usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. | - | Histologically identical to placental choriocarcinoma. | Histologically identical to the more common placental lesions. Composed of proliferating syncytiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts; villi are absent. | - | Elaborate high levels of chorionic gonadotropins (hCG). | Most exist in combination with other germ cell tumors; pure choriocarcinoma is extremely rare. | Usually metastasized hematogenously to the lungs, liver, bone, and other sites by the time of diagnosis. | Generally unresponsive to chemotherapy and are often fatal. |
| **Other Germ Cell Tumors** A category for other rare, malignant germ cell tumors. | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | **1. Embryonal carcinoma:** a highly malignant tumor of primitive embryonal elements. **2. Polyembryoma:** a malignant tumor containing so-called embryoid bodies. **3. Mixed germ cell tumors:** contain various combinations of dysgerminoma, teratoma, yolk sac tumor, and choriocarcinoma. | - | - |
| **Sex Cord–Stromal Tumors** Ovarian neoplasms that arise from the ovarian stroma, which is derived from the sex cords of the embryonic gonad. | Arise from the ovarian stroma (sex cords of embryonic gonad). | - | The undifferentiated gonadal mesenchyme produces specific cell types, and tumors resembling all of these cell types can be identified in the ovary. | - | - | - | Tumors may be feminizing (granulosa/theca cell tumors secrete estrogens) or masculinizing (Leydig cell tumors secrete androgens). | - | Granulosa cell tumors, Fibromas, Thecomas, Fibrothecomas, Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, Steroid (lipid) cell tumors. | - | - |
| **Granulosa Cell Tumors** Tumors composed of cells that resemble granulosa cells of a developing ovarian follicle. They account for 5% of all ovarian tumors. | - | Adult type: approx. two-thirds occur in postmenopausal women. | Potentially malignant, pursue an indolent course. Recurrences can appear 10 to 20 years after removal of the original tumor. | Most common driver mutations are in the **FOXL2** gene, which is mutated in 97% of adult granulosa cell tumors. FOXL2 encodes a transcription factor important in granulosa cell development. | Usually unilateral. Vary from microscopic foci to large, solid, and cystic encapsulated masses. Hormonally active tumors have a yellow coloration on their cut surfaces, due to intracellular lipids. | Small, cuboidal to polygonal cells may grow in anastomosing cords, sheets, or strands. Occasionally, small, glandlike structures filled with acidophilic material recall immature follicles (**Call-Exner bodies**). | May elaborate large amounts of estrogen. In prepubertal girls, may produce precocious sexual development. In adult women, may be associated with proliferative breast disease. Occasionally produce androgens, masculinizing the patient. | Elevated tissue and serum levels of **inhibin**, a product of granulosa cells. Inhibin is useful in diagnosis and monitoring. | **Adult granulosa cell tumors:** 95% of cases. **Juvenile granulosa cell tumors.** | In 10% to 15% of women with steroid-producing tumors, endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial carcinoma eventually develop. Malignant behavior (recurrence, extension) ranges from 5% to 25%. | Surgical therapy for local recurrences may be amenable. |
| **Fibromas, Thecomas, and Fibrothecomas** Tumors arising in the ovarian stroma composed of either fibroblasts (fibromas) or plump spindle cells with lipid droplets (thecomas). Fibrothecomas contain a mixture. | Arise from ovarian stroma. | - | - | - | **Fibromas:** Unilateral in 90% of cases. Usually solid, spherical or slightly lobulated, encapsulated, hard, gray-white masses covered by glistening, intact ovarian serosa. | **Fibromas:** Composed of well-differentiated fibroblasts and scant interspersed collagenous stroma. **Thecomas:** Composed of plump spindle cells with lipid droplets. | Most come to attention as a pelvic mass, sometimes accompanied by pain. Fibrothecomas and pure thecomas may be hormonally active (estrogenic). Pure fibromas are hormonally inactive. | - | - | **Meigs syndrome:** a combination of ovarian tumor, hydrothorax (usually right-sided), and ascites. Ascites is found in 40% of cases with tumors >6 cm. **Basal cell nevus syndrome.** Rarely, cellular fibromas with mitotic activity (fibrosarcomas) may pursue a malignant course. | - |
| **Sertoli-Leydig Cell Tumors** Tumors that recapitulate testicular Sertoli or Leydig cells. They are often functional. | - | Occur in women of all ages, peak incidence in second and third decades. | - | In over one-half of cases, tumor cells have mutations in **DICER1**, a gene that encodes an endonuclease essential for proper processing of micro-RNAs. This suggests genesis involves abnormalities of gene expression related to dysregulation of micro-RNAs. | Unilateral and may resemble granulosa cell tumors. Cut surface is usually solid and varies from gray to golden brown in appearance. | A range of differentiation is seen. **Well-differentiated** show tubules of Sertoli cells or Leydig cells. **Intermediate forms** show immature tubules and large eosinophilic Leydig cells. **Poorly differentiated** have a sarcomatous pattern. Heterologous elements (mucinous glands, bone, cartilage) may be present. | Most commonly produce masculinization or defeminization. May block normal female sexual development in children, cause atrophy of breasts, amenorrhea, loss of hair in women. Progresses to striking virilization (hirsutism) with male hair distribution, clitoral hypertrophy, voice changes. A few have estrogenic effects. | - | - | Recurrence or metastasis occurs in less than 5% of cases. | - |
| **Other Sex Cord–Stromal Tumors** A category for several other uncommon but distinctive ovarian tumors of sex cord or stromal origin that often produce steroid hormones. | - | - | - | - | - | **Hilus cell tumors:** Comprised of large lipid-laden Leydig cells with characteristic cytoplasmic structures called **Reinke crystalloids**. | **Hilus cell tumors (pure Leydig cell tumors):** Present with evidence of masculinization (hirsutism, voice changes, clitoral enlargement). Produce predominantly testosterone. Almost always benign. **Pregnancy luteoma:** Rare tumor resembling corpus luteum of pregnancy. May produce virilization in pregnant patients and their female infants. **Gonadoblastoma:** Uncommon tumor of germ cells and sex cord-stroma derivatives. Occurs in individuals with abnormal sexual development. 80% of patients are phenotypic females. | - | - | **Gonadoblastoma:** A coexistent dysgerminoma occurs in 50% of cases. Prognosis is excellent if completely excised. | **Hilus cell tumors:** Surgical excision. |
| **Metastatic Tumors to Ovary** Secondary tumors of the ovary derived from other primary sites. | Most common are from müllerian origin: uterus, fallopian tube, contralateral ovary, pelvic peritoneum. Most common extra-müllerian tumors are from breast and gastrointestinal tract (colon, stomach, biliary tract, pancreas). Appendiceal tumors can also metastasize. | - | - | - | **Krukenberg tumor:** characterized by bilateral metastases. | **Krukenberg tumor:** composed of mucin-producing cancer cells with a 'signet-ring' appearance, most often of gastric origin. | - | - | **Krukenberg tumor:** a classic metastatic gastrointestinal carcinoma involving the ovaries. | **Pseudomyxoma peritonei:** rare cases derived from appendiceal tumors. | - |
| **Ectopic Pregnancy** Implantation of the fetus in a site other than the normal intrauterine location. Accounts for 2% of confirmed pregnancies. | Implantation of fertilized ovum outside the uterus. Most common site is extrauterine fallopian tube (90%). Other sites: ovary, abdominal cavity, intrauterine portion of fallopian tube (cornual pregnancy). | Prior pelvic inflammatory disease resulting in chronic salpingitis (35-50% of patients). Peritubal scarring/adhesions (from appendicitis, endometriosis, previous surgery). Use of an intrauterine contraceptive device (twofold increase). | 1. Fertilized ovum implants in abnormal location.  2. Placental tissue, amniotic sac, and fetus develop.  3. In tubal pregnancy, trophoblastic cells invade the fallopian tube wall.  4. Growth of the gestational sac distends the tube, causing thinning of the wall and rupture. | - | Tubal pregnancy is the most common cause of **hematosalpinx** (blood-filled fallopian tube). Embryonal sac is surrounded by immature chorionic villi. | Initially, embryonal sac with immature chorionic villi implants in the tube lumen. Trophoblastic cells invade the tubal wall. | Onset of moderate to severe abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding 6 to 8 weeks after the last menstrual period. Rupture of a tubal pregnancy is a medical emergency; patient may rapidly develop hemorrhagic shock and signs of an acute abdomen. | Determination of chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) titers. Pelvic sonography. Endometrial biopsy showing decidua without chorionic villi or implantation site. Laparoscopy. | - | Rupture, which can lead to massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage, sometimes fatal. Tubal abortion (extrusion of products through fimbriated end). Still accounts for 4% to 10% of pregnancy-related deaths. | - |
| **Abnormalities of Placental Implantation** Conditions where the placenta implants or adheres abnormally in the uterus. | **Placenta previa:** placenta implants in lower uterine segment or cervix. **Placenta accreta:** caused by partial or complete absence of the decidua, leading to direct adherence of villi to myometrium. | **Placenta accreta:** placenta previa (in up to 60% of cases), history of previous cesarean delivery. | - | - | - | **Placenta accreta:** placental villous tissue adheres directly to the myometrium. | **Placenta previa:** often leads to serious third-trimester bleeding. | - | **Placenta previa:** placenta implants in the lower uterine segment or cervix. A **complete placenta previa** covers the internal cervical os. **Placenta accreta:** villous tissue adheres directly to the myometrium. | **Placenta previa:** requires cesarean delivery to avert placental rupture and fatal maternal hemorrhage. **Placenta accreta:** failure of placental separation at birth, an important cause of severe, potentially life-threatening postpartum bleeding. | - |
| **Placental Infections** Infections of the placenta that develop by either ascending or hematogenous routes. | **Ascending infections:** by far the most common, virtually always bacterial.  **Hematogenous (transplacental) infections:** bacterial (Listeria) or viral (TORCH group). | - | **Ascending:** Localized infection of membranes leads to premature rupture. Fetal response is a vasculitis of umbilical/chorionic vessels. **Hematogenous:** Bacteria spread to placenta, leading to acute villitis. TORCH agents give rise to chronic villitis. | - | In ascending infection, amniotic fluid may be cloudy with purulent exudate. Placenta may have greenish opaque membranes. | **Ascending:** Chorion-amnion contains an infiltrate of neutrophils with edema and congestion of vessels. Funisitis (umbilical cord inflammation) and vasculitis of chorionic plate vessels may be present. **Hematogenous:** **Acute villitis** (e.g., Listeria), **Chronic villitis** (e.g. TORCH) with inflammatory cell infiltrates in chorionic villi. | - | - | - | Premature rupture of membranes and preterm delivery. | - |
| **Preeclampsia and Eclampsia** A systemic syndrome characterized by widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction presenting with hypertension, edema, and proteinuria. Eclampsia is the severe form with convulsions. | The placenta plays a central role. Precise cause unknown. | Occurs in 3-5% of pregnant women. More common in primiparas (women pregnant for the first time). Usually last trimester. Hydatidiform mole, preexisting kidney disease, hypertension, coagulopathies. | **1. Abnormal placental vasculature:** Abnormal trophoblastic implantation and failure of physiologic remodeling of maternal spiral arteries. This leads to placental ischemia. **2. Endothelial dysfunction and angiogenic imbalance:** The hypoxic placenta releases antiangiogenic factors (**sFlt1**, **endoglin**) into maternal circulation. These antagonize VEGF and TGFβ, causing systemic endothelial dysfunction, vasoconstriction, and increased vascular permeability. **3. Coagulation abnormalities:** Hypercoagulable state related to reduced PGI2 and increased procoagulant factors, leading to thrombi. | - | Placenta may have infarcts and retroplacental hematomas. Liver shows irregular, focal subcapsular and intraparenchymal hemorrhages. Brain may have hemorrhage. | **Placenta:** Infarcts, exaggerated ischemic changes (increased syncytial knots), retroplacental hematomas, abnormal decidual vessels with thrombi, fibrinoid necrosis, or **acute atherosis**. **Kidney:** Glomeruli show marked swelling of endothelial cells, amorphous dense deposits, mesangial cell hyperplasia; fibrin thrombi in glomeruli and capillaries. **Liver:** Fibrin thrombi in portal capillaries, foci of hemorrhagic necrosis. | Starts after 34 weeks. Onset marked by hypertension and edema, with proteinuria appearing days later. Headaches and visual disturbances indicate severe preeclampsia. Eclampsia is heralded by convulsions and eventual coma. | - | - | **Eclampsia** (convulsions), hypercoagulability, acute renal failure, pulmonary edema. About 10% develop **HELLP syndrome** (microangiopathic Hemolytic anemia, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelets). Bilateral renal cortical necrosis. Twofold increase in long-term risk of vascular disease. | Delivery is the treatment of choice for term pregnancies. Antihypertensive therapy does not affect the disease course. |
| **Hydatidiform Mole** A gestational trophoblastic disease characterized by cystic swelling of the chorionic villi and variable trophoblastic proliferation. | **Complete Mole:** Fertilization of an egg that has lost its female chromosomes. Genetic material is completely paternally derived. **Partial Mole:** Fertilization of an egg with two sperm. | Risk is higher at the two ends of reproductive life (teenagers and women 40-50 years old). | - | **Complete Mole:** 90% are **46,XX** (from duplication of one sperm's genetic material, called **androgenesis**). 10% are 46,XX or 46,XY (from two sperm fertilizing an empty egg). **Partial Mole:** Karyotype is triploid (e.g., 69,XXY) or occasionally tetraploid (92,XXXY). | Appears as a delicate, friable mass of thin-walled, translucent, cystic, grapelike structures consisting of swollen (hydropic) villi. | **Complete Mole:** Microscopic abnormalities involve all or most of the villous tissue. Villi are enlarged and scalloped with central cavitation (cisterns), covered by extensive trophoblast proliferation involving the entire circumference. Fetal tissue is absent. **Partial Mole:** Only a fraction of the villi are enlarged and edematous. Trophoblastic hyperplasia is focal and less marked. Fetal tissues are typically present. | Usually diagnosed during early pregnancy (avg 9 weeks) by pelvic sonography. Most present with spontaneous miscarriage or undergo curettage for abnormal ultrasound findings. In complete mole, hCG levels greatly exceed those of normal pregnancy of similar gestational age. | Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels. | **Complete Mole** and **Partial Mole**. | Associated with an increased risk of persistent trophoblastic disease (invasive mole) or choriocarcinoma. **Complete Mole:** 2.5% risk of subsequent choriocarcinoma; 15% risk of persistent or invasive mole. **Partial Mole:** Increased risk of persistent molar disease but not associated with choriocarcinoma. | Most are successfully removed by curettage. Patients are monitored for 6 months to 1 year with hCG levels to ensure they decrease to nonpregnant levels. |
| **Complete Mole** A type of hydatidiform mole where the genetic material is completely paternally derived and fetal tissue is absent. | Fertilization of an egg that has lost its female chromosomes. | Same as Hydatidiform Mole. | Embryo dies very early in development and is usually not identified. | 90% are **46,XX** (from duplication of one sperm's DNA via **androgenesis**). 10% from fertilization of an empty egg by two sperm (46,XX or 46,XY). | Swollen, edematous villi, grapelike structures. | All or most villi are enlarged and hydropic, with central cavitation (cisterns). Circumferential, extensive trophoblast proliferation. Fetal tissues are absent. | Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels greatly exceed those of normal pregnancy of similar gestational age. | Extremely high hCG levels. | - | 2.5% risk of subsequent choriocarcinoma. 15% risk of persistent or invasive mole. | Curettage followed by hCG monitoring. |
| **Partial Mole** A type of hydatidiform mole resulting from fertilization of an egg by two sperm, usually triploid, with fetal tissues present. | Fertilization of a normal egg by two sperm. | Same as Hydatidiform Mole. | - | Karyotype is triploid (e.g., 69,XXY) or occasionally tetraploid (92,XXXY). | Some villi are swollen and hydropic, mixed with normal villi. | Only a fraction of the villi are enlarged and edematous. Trophoblastic hyperplasia is focal and less marked than in complete moles. Fetal tissues are typically present. | Presents as spontaneous miscarriage. hCG levels are less elevated than in complete moles. | hCG levels elevated, but less than complete mole. | - | Increased risk of persistent molar disease but are not associated with choriocarcinoma. | Curettage followed by hCG monitoring. |
| **Invasive Mole** An infiltrative lesion where a hydatidiform mole penetrates or perforates the uterine wall. | A complication of a hydatidiform mole. | Previous hydatidiform mole. | There is invasion of the myometrium by hydropic chorionic villi, accompanied by proliferation of trophoblasts. Villi may invade parametrial tissue and blood vessels, and can embolize to distant sites (lungs, brain). | - | - | Hydropic chorionic villi with proliferating cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts are seen invading the myometrium. | Manifests clinically with vaginal bleeding and irregular uterine enlargement. It is always associated with a persistently elevated serum hCG. | Persistently elevated serum hCG after molar pregnancy evacuation. | - | Can perforate the uterine wall, leading to uterine rupture. Emboli to distant sites occur but do not grow like true metastases and eventually regress even without chemotherapy. | Responds well to chemotherapy, but may result in uterine rupture necessitating hysterectomy. |
| **Choriocarcinoma (Gestational)** A malignant neoplasm of trophoblastic cells derived from a previously normal or abnormal pregnancy. | May be preceded by: complete hydatidiform moles (50%), previous abortions (25%), normal pregnancies (approx. 22%), or ectopic pregnancies. Can be distinguished by the presence of paternally derived DNA. | Prior hydatidiform mole is a major risk factor. | Rapidly invasive and metastasizes widely, with a high propensity for hematogenous spread. | - | A soft, fleshy, yellow-white tumor that usually has large pale areas of necrosis and extensive hemorrhage. | Consists entirely of proliferating syncytiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts. **Chorionic villi are absent**. Mitoses are abundant. Invades the underlying myometrium and frequently penetrates blood vessels. | Usually manifests as irregular vaginal spotting of a bloody, brown fluid. This may appear during a normal pregnancy, after miscarriage, or months after. Radiographs may disclose metastatic lesions. | hCG levels are typically elevated to levels above those in hydatidiform moles. Some necrotic tumors have low hCG. | - | Widespread metastases are characteristic. Most common sites are lungs (50%) and vagina (30% to 40%), followed by brain, liver, bone, and kidney. | Responds well to chemotherapy. Results are spectacular, with nearly 100% remission and a high rate of cures. Many cured patients have had normal subsequent pregnancies. |
