# Spondylolysis and Spondylolisthesis

### Definitions

*   **[[Spondylolysis]]:** A defect or stress fracture in the [[pars interarticularis]] (the isthmus of bone connecting the superior and inferior articular facets) of the vertebral arch. It represents a dissolution of the neural arch.
*   **[[Spondylolisthesis]]:** The forward slippage (displacement) of one vertebra over the one immediately below it.
    *   **Retrolisthesis:** Backward displacement of a vertebra (less common).

### Surgical Anatomy
*   **Site:** The lesion is typically in the [[pars interarticularis]].
*   **Level:**
    *   **L5 over S1:** Most common site for isthmic/lytic spondylolisthesis.
    *   **L4 over L5:** Most common site for degenerative spondylolisthesis.

### Etiology and Classification (Wiltse-Newman-Macnab)

This is the standard classification system used to describe the etiology of the slip.

| Type | Name | Pathophysiology | Clinical Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type I** | **Dysplastic (Congenital)** | Congenital deficiency of the superior sacral facet or inferior L5 facet. | Associated with [[Spina bifida]] occulta. The neural arch is intact. |
| **Type II** | **Isthmic (Lytic)** | Lesion in the [[pars interarticularis]]. | **Most common type** overall. Usually L5-S1. |
| | *Subtype A* | Lytic: Fatigue fracture of pars. | Due to repetitive stress/extension. |
| | *Subtype B* | Elongated pars. | Intact but stretched pars. |
| | *Subtype C* | Acute fracture. | Due to severe trauma. |
| **Type III** | **Degenerative** | Instability due to facet joint osteoarthritis and disc degeneration. | **No pars defect.** Occurs in older adults (usually >40 yrs). Common at L4-L5. |
| **Type IV** | **Traumatic** | Fracture of the posterior elements (pedicle, lamina) other than the pars. | Results from acute severe injury. |
| **Type V** | **Pathologic** | Bone disease weakening the structure. | Local or generalized bone disease (e.g., tumor, infection, [[osteoporosis]]). |
| **Type VI** | **Iatrogenic** | Post-surgical instability. | Caused by excessive removal of posterior elements (e.g., wide laminectomy). |

### Grading System (Meyerding Classification)

The severity of the slip is graded based on the percentage of the vertebral body width that has slipped forward over the body below.

| Grade | Percentage of Slip |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Grade I** | 0 – 25% |
| **Grade II** | 26 – 50% |
| **Grade III** | 51 – 75% |
| **Grade IV** | 76 – 100% |
| **Grade V** | > 100% (Known as **[[Spondyloptosis]]**) |

### Clinical Features

#### Symptoms
*   **Asymptomatic:** Many cases of spondylolysis and Grade I slips are incidental findings.
*   **Low Back Pain:** Mechanical in nature. Aggravated by standing, walking, or extension exercises; relieved by rest.
*   **[[Sciatica]]:** Radiating pain to buttocks or posterior thigh due to nerve root irritation (L5 root is most commonly affected in L5-S1 isthmic slip).
*   **Neurogenic Claudication:** Pain/heaviness in legs after walking, relieved by sitting/bending forward (typical of **Degenerative Spondylolisthesis**).

#### Physical Signs
*   **[[Step Sign]]:** A palpable step-off is felt over the spinous processes. In L5-S1 spondylolisthesis, the spinous process of L5 remains with the posterior elements (which may be loose) or moves forward, creating a "step" relative to the sacrum or the vertebra above, depending on the type.
*   **Increased [[Lumbar Lordosis]]:** The patient may have a swayback appearance.
*   **Transverse Furrow:** A skin crease/fold may be visible across the back above the iliac crests in severe slips.
*   **Hamstring Tightness:** Very common; limits straight leg raising.
*   **Gait:** In severe cases (Grade III-IV), the patient may exhibit a "waddling gait" due to pelvic instability and hamstring tightness.

### Diagnostic Imaging

#### 1. Plain X-rays
*   **Lateral View:** Best for assessing the grade of slip (Meyerding grading) and disc height.
*   **Oblique View:** Diagnostic for **[[Spondylolysis]]**.
    *   **[[Scottish Terrier Sign]] (Scottie Dog Sign):**
        *   Eye: Pedicle
        *   Ear: Superior articular process
        *   Nose: Transverse process
        *   Front leg: Inferior articular process
        *   **Neck: [[Pars interarticularis]]**
        *   **Clinical Implication:** If the "dog has a collar" or the "neck is broken," it indicates a defect in the pars interarticularis (spondylolysis).
*   **AP View:**
    *   **Inverted Napoleon Hat Sign:** Seen in severe spondylolisthesis (Grade V/Spondyloptosis) where L5 slips completely off S1.

#### 2. CT Scan
*   Best for defining bony anatomy and confirming the pars defect if X-rays are equivocal.

#### 3. MRI
*   Gold standard for soft tissue evaluation.
*   Visualizes nerve root compression, disc herniation, and spinal stenosis.
*   Essential for preoperative planning.

### Treatment

#### Conservative Management
Indicated for Grade I/II slips and mild symptoms.
*   **Rest:** Avoidance of heavy lifting and hyperextension activities.
*   **Medication:** [[NSAIDs]] and muscle relaxants.
*   **Physical Therapy:**
    *   **Flexion exercises:** To reduce lumbar lordosis and open the spinal canal.
    *   Hamstring stretching.
    *   Core strengthening.
*   **Bracing:** Lumbosacral corset or brace (e.g., Boston overlap brace) for temporary immobilization during acute pain.

#### Surgical Management
**Indications:**
1.  Failure of conservative therapy (persistent disabling pain).
2.  Neurological deficit (motor weakness, cauda equina syndrome).
3.  Slip > 50% (Grade III, IV, V).
4.  Progressive slip in children/adolescents.

**Procedures:**
1.  **Decompression (Gill's Laminectomy):** Removal of the loose posterior arch (lamina/spinous process) to relieve nerve root compression. Often sufficient for degenerative slips if stability is maintained.
2.  **Posterolateral Fusion (PLF):** Fusion of transverse processes using bone grafts (in situ fusion).
3.  **Interbody Fusion (PLIF/TLIF):** Placing a cage/graft in the disc space to restore height and fuse the anterior column.
4.  **Reduction and Stabilization:** Using pedicle screws and rods to reduce the slip and fix the spine. Reduction is controversial due to risk of L5 nerve root stretch injury but is often attempted in high-grade slips.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Degenerative Spondylolisthesis** rarely exceeds Grade I or II because the posterior elements are intact, limiting the slip.
*   **Isthmic Spondylolisthesis** is the most likely cause of back pain in an adolescent athlete (e.g., gymnasts, fast bowlers).
*   **Spondyloptosis** (Grade V) may require complex reconstruction or even vertebrectomy (Gaines procedure).
