# [[General Toxicology]] > Gastric Lavage

### **Gastric Lavage (Stomach Wash)**

[[Gastric Lavage]] is a method of **gut decontamination** involving the passage of a tube via the mouth or nose into the stomach to sequentially remove and replace gastric contents to flush out ingested poisons.

### **Indications**
It is generally indicated when a patient has ingested a life-threatening amount of poison and presents within the **"Golden Hour"** (usually 1–2 hours).

*   **Acute Poisoning:** Removal of unabsorbed poison from the stomach.
*   **Delayed Lavage:** Useful even after 4–6 hours (or more) in:
    *   **Salicylates** (form concretions/bezoars).
    *   **Anticholinergics / Tricyclic Antidepressants** (causes pylorospasm and delays gastric emptying).
    *   **Opioids/Morphine** (regurgitated into the stomach from bile/blood).
    *   **[[Datura]] seeds** (remain in stomach folds).
    *   **Arsenic** (heavy metal, stays longer).
    *   **Sustained-release preparations.**
*   **Diagnostic:** To identify the poison by analyzing the aspirate (smell, color, chemical analysis).
*   **Therapeutic:** To administer [[Activated Charcoal]] or specific antidotes (e.g., Desferrioxamine for Iron) directly into the stomach.

### **Contraindications**
*(Mnemonic: **C C H S**)*

1.  **C - Corrosives:** **Absolute contraindication** for strong mineral acids (Sulfuric, Nitric, Hydrochloric) and strong Alkalis. Risk of **perforation** of the weakened esophageal/gastric wall.
    *   *Exception:* **[[Carbolic Acid]] (Phenol)**. Lavage can be done cautiously because it hardens the mucosa (leather-bottle stomach) rather than thinning it.
2.  **C - Coma/Convulsions:** Unless the airway is protected by a cuffed **endotracheal tube**. Risk of aspiration pneumonia.
3.  **H - Hydrocarbons:** [[Kerosene]], Petrol, Turpentine. Risk of **chemical pneumonitis** due to aspiration.
    *   *Exception:* If a cuffed endotracheal tube is inserted first to protect the airway.
4.  **S - Strychnine:** Risk of precipitating severe **convulsions** and asphyxia. Lavage only after controlling seizures (e.g., with Diazepam).
5.  **Others:**
    *   Esophageal varices or strictures.
    *   Recent gastric or esophageal surgery.
    *   Advanced pregnancy.
    *   Sharp foreign bodies (glass, needles).
    *   Serious cardiac instability.

### **Equipment**
*   **Ewald’s Tube:** Large bore (30–40 French), firm rubber tube. Best for adults to remove pill fragments.
*   **Boas Tube:** Similar to Ewald's but with a compressible bulb.
*   **Ryle's Tube:** Narrow bore; useful only for infants or liquid poisons. Ineffective for pills in adults.
*   **Lavacuator:** Double-lumen tube with continuous suction and irrigation.
*   **Mouth Gag:** To prevent biting the tube.
*   **Others:** Suction apparatus, funnel, bucket, lubricant (glycerin/paraffin), syringe.

### **Procedure**

1.  **Consent:** Obtain informed consent (implied consent in life-threatening emergencies).
2.  **Position:** **Left Lateral Decubitus** position with the head slightly lower than the feet (**Trendelenburg**). This keeps the pylorus high (preventing poison from moving to the intestine) and the mouth low (preventing aspiration).
3.  **Measurement:** Measure distance from the **bridge of the nose to the earlobe to the xiphisternum** (approx. 50 cm). Mark the tube.
4.  **Insertion:**
    *   Remove dentures.
    *   Lubricate the tip.
    *   Pass the tube gently through the mouth (less risk of epistaxis than nasal route) while asking the patient to swallow.
    *   Stop if there is severe coughing or cyanosis (tube may be in the trachea).
5.  **Confirmation:** Confirm placement in the stomach by aspirating gastric contents (check pH) or auscultating the epigastrium while injecting air.
6.  **Aspiration (First Step):** Aspirate the stomach contents **before** instilling fluid. **This sample is the most important for toxicological analysis** (highest concentration).
7.  **Lavage (The Wash):**
    *   Use **warm water** or normal saline (body temperature to prevent hypothermia).
    *   Instill **small aliquots** (200–250 ml in adults; 10–15 ml/kg in children).
    *   *Note:* Using large amounts (e.g., 1 liter at a time) forces the pyloric sphincter open, pushing poison into the small intestine (absorption site).
    *   Drain by gravity (siphonage) or suction.
    *   Repeat until the return fluid is **clear and odorless**.
8.  **Completion:** Before removing the tube, administer **Activated Charcoal** (1 g/kg) or a cathartic if indicated.
9.  **Removal:** Pinch the tube tight while withdrawing to prevent fluid dripping into the larynx/trachea.

### **Lavage Fluids**

| Poison Involved | Lavage Fluid Solution | Mechanism/Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unknown / General** | Warm Water or Normal Saline | Mechanical dilution and removal. |
| **Oxidizable Poisons** (Opium, [[Strychnine]], [[Cyanide]], Phosphorus) | **Potassium Permanganate (KMnO4)** (1:5000) | Oxidizes the poison to non-toxic metabolites. Solution turns brown/colorless. |
| **[[Oxalic Acid]]** | **Calcium Gluconate / Lactate** or Lime Water | Forms insoluble Calcium Oxalate. |
| **[[Phenol]] (Carbolic Acid)** | 10% Glycerin or Castor Oil or Olive Oil | Dissolves phenol and facilitates removal. Follow with warm water. |
| **Iron** | 1% Sodium Bicarbonate | Forms ferrous carbonate (less toxic). |
| **Iodine** | Starch solution | Forms blue-colored complex (easy to identify and remove). |
| **Alkaloids** | Tannic Acid / Strong Tea | Precipitates alkaloids. |
| **Silver Nitrate** | Normal Saline | Forms insoluble Silver Chloride. |

### **Complications**

1.  **Aspiration Pneumonia:** The most serious and common complication. Can lead to ARDS.
2.  **Laryngospasm and Hypoxia:** Due to stimulation of the larynx.
3.  **Perforation:** Of the esophagus or stomach (rare, but fatal in corrosive cases).
4.  **Electrolyte Imbalance:** Hyponatremia/water intoxication (if plain water is used excessively in children).
5.  **Vagal Inhibition:** Sudden cardiac arrest due to vagal stimulation during insertion.
6.  **Hypothermia:** If cold fluids are used.
7.  **Sore Throat / Trauma:** Abrasion to pharynx/esophagus.

### **Medicolegal Aspects**

*   **Preservation:** The **first aspirate** must be preserved separately (clean glass bottle, no preservative usually, or saturated saline) as it contains the highest concentration of poison. Subsequent washings are less useful for analysis but should be collected if the first aspirate is scanty.
*   **Documentation:** Detailed notes on the procedure, color/smell of aspirate, and patient condition.
*   **Duty:** Failure to perform lavage in indicated cases may amount to **[[Medical Negligence]]**. Conversely, performing it in absolute contraindications (like sulfuric acid ingestion) causing death is also negligence.
*   **Autopsy Findings:** If death occurs, the pathologist may find abrasions on the esophageal mucosa or submucosal hemorrhages in the stomach (Magenstrasse) due to the tube tip.
