# [[Regional Injuries]] > Head Injury Extradural Hemorrhage

### Head Injury: Extradural Hemorrhage (EDH)

**Definition**
Extradural hemorrhage (EDH), also known as **Epidural Hematoma**, is a collection of blood in the potential space between the inner table of the skull and the **[[dura mater]]**.

### **Incidence and Etiology**
*   **Incidence:** Least common type of meningeal bleeding (1–3% of head injuries).
*   **Age:** Common in young adults (20–40 years). Rare in the elderly and infants (below 2 years) because the dura is firmly adherent to the skull, preventing stripping.
*   **Mechanism:** Almost exclusively traumatic.
    *   It is a **Coup Injury** (occurs at the site of impact).
    *   Impact causes local deformation of the skull → **stripping of the dura** from the bone → rupture of vessels → accumulation of blood.
    *   Associated with **skull fracture** (usually fissured/linear) in 90% of cases.

### **Source of Bleeding**
| Source | Location/Cause | Frequency |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Arterial** | **[[Middle Meningeal Artery]]** (Anterior or Posterior branch). Usually due to fracture of the temporal bone (Squamous part). | **Most Common** |
| **Venous** | Dural venous sinuses (Sagittal or Transverse sinus). Due to blows on the vertex or occiput. | Less Common |
| **Diploic** | Diploic veins from the skull bone marrow. | Rare |

### **Clinical Features**
The classic clinical presentation follows a specific timeline:
1.  **Concussion:** Immediate transient loss of consciousness at the time of impact.
2.  **[[Lucid Interval]]:**
    *   A period of normal consciousness between the initial concussion and subsequent coma.
    *   Seen in **30–50%** of cases (Not pathognomonic, but classic).
    *   Duration varies from a few hours to days.
    *   *Pathophysiology:* The patient recovers from concussion, but as the hematoma expands, it increases intracranial pressure leading to secondary unconsciousness.
3.  **Compression (Coma):** As the hematoma enlarges (>30–50 ml), symptoms of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) appear:
    *   Headache, vomiting, confusion (may mimic **[[drunkenness]]**).
    *   **Hutchinson’s Pupil:** Ipsilateral fixed dilated pupil (due to compression of the Oculomotor nerve/CN III).
    *   Contralateral hemiparesis.
    *   **Kernohan’s Notch Phenomenon:** False localizing sign causing *ipsilateral* hemiparesis due to compression of the contralateral cerebral peduncle against the tentorium.
4.  **Terminal Stage:** Decerebrate rigidity and respiratory failure due to brainstem compression.

**Mnemonic for Clinical Picture: LEMON**
*   **L**ens shaped (Biconvex) on CT
*   **E**xtradural space
*   **M**iddle meningeal artery
*   **O**ften has Lucid Interval
*   **N**eurodeficit (Ipsilateral pupil, Contralateral hemiparesis)

### **Autopsy Findings**
**1. External Examination**
*   Evidence of scalp contusion or boggy swelling, usually in the temporal or parietal region.

**2. Skull**
*   **Linear/Fissured fracture** is commonly seen traversing the groove of the middle meningeal artery.

**3. Hematoma Characteristics**
*   **Location:** Between the skull and dura mater.
*   **Shape:** **Disc-shaped** or **Biconvex** (Lens-shaped) because the dura is anchored at suture lines, limiting the spread.
*   **Consistency:** Firm, rubbery, reddish-purple blood clot.
*   **Volume:** Usually 100–120 ml constitutes a fatal volume.
*   **Adherence:** The clot is strictly adherent to the dura.

**4. Brain**
*   Localised concavity on the brain surface corresponding to the clot.
*   Flattening of gyri and obliteration of sulci (sign of cerebral edema/compression).
*   Herniation (Subfalcine or Transtentorial).

### **Difference between Traumatic EDH and Heat Hematoma**
During autopsies of burn victims, heat hematoma (artifact) must be differentiated from antemortem EDH.

| Feature | Traumatic EDH | [[Heat Hematoma]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cause** | Blunt force trauma | Intense heat/charring |
| **Site** | Usually temporal/parietal (Pterion) | Any site (usually vertex/frontal) |
| **Distribution** | Localized/Unilateral | Often diffuse/Bilateral |
| **Clot Texture** | Firm, rubbery, solid | Soft, friable, crumbly |
| **Appearance** | Reddish-purple | Chocolate brown/Pink (if CO present) |
| **Structure** | Homogenous | **Honeycomb** appearance (steam bubbles) |
| **Brain** | Compressed/Edematous | Cooked/Hardened |
| **Skull** | Linear fracture common | Heat fractures may be present |

### **Medicolegal Importance**
1.  **Traumatic Origin:** EDH is almost always due to trauma; it confirms antemortem injury.
2.  **Negligence:** Failure to diagnose EDH during the **Lucid Interval** is a common ground for **[[medical negligence]]** suits. If a doctor discharges a head injury patient during this interval without observation or CT scan, and the patient subsequently dies, the doctor may be held liable,.
3.  **Prognosis:** It has a relatively good prognosis if evacuated surgically in time. It is a neurosurgical emergency.
4.  **Manner of Death:** Usually accidental (falls, traffic accidents) or homicidal (blow to the head).
