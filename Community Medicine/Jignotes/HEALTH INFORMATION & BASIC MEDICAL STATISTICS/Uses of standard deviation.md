# [[HEALTH INFORMATION & BASIC MEDICAL STATISTICS]] > Uses of standard deviation

### Uses of [[Standard Deviation]]

**Standard Deviation (SD)** is the most frequently used and generally the most appropriate measure of dispersion (variability) in medical statistics. It is defined as the "Root-Mean-Square Deviation" of the values from their arithmetic mean,.

The specific uses of Standard Deviation in biostatistics and medical research are as follows:

### 1. Summarizes Deviation (Measure of Dispersion)
*   It summarizes the deviations of a large distribution from the mean into a single figure, serving as a **unit of variation**.
*   It indicates how the data is spread around the mean:
    *   **Large SD:** Data points are widely spread (far from the mean),.
    *   **Small SD:** Data points are clustered closely around the mean,.

### 2. Defines Normal Limits (Normality)
*   In a **[[Normal Distribution]]** (Gaussian curve), SD helps define the limits of normality for biological characteristics (e.g., height, blood pressure),.
*   It quantifies the probability of occurrence of a specified value in the population.
    *   **Mean $\pm$ 1 SD** covers **68.3%** of observations,.
    *   **Mean $\pm$ 2 SD** covers **95.4%** of observations (often used as the "Normal Range" in clinical practice),.
    *   **Mean $\pm$ 3 SD** covers **99.7%** of observations,.
*   Values lying outside Mean $\pm$ 2 SD are generally considered **abnormal** or rare (occurring less than 5% of the time by chance).

### 3. Basis for Standard Error (SE)
*   SD is essential for calculating the **[[Standard Error]]** of the mean ($SE_{\bar{x}}$),.
*   **Formula:** $SE = \frac{SD}{\sqrt{n}}$.
*   Standard Error determines whether the difference between means of two samples (e.g., drug effect vs. placebo) is real or due to chance,.

### 4. Determination of Sample Size
*   It helps in finding the suitable **[[Sample Size]]** required to draw valid conclusions for a study,.
*   A larger SD in the population requires a larger sample size to achieve the same level of precision.

### 5. Calculation of Coefficient of Variation (CV)
*   SD is used to calculate the **[[Coefficient of Variation]]**, which compares the relative variability of two different characteristics (e.g., height vs. weight) or groups with different units of measurement,.
*   **Formula:** $CV = (\frac{SD}{Mean}) \times 100$.

### 6. Tests of Significance
*   SD is a prerequisite for parametric tests of significance, such as the **[[Z-test]]** (for large samples) and **[[Student's t-test]]** (for small samples).
*   It helps indicate if the variation of an individual observation from the mean is by chance (biological) or real (pathological).

### Clinical Relevance
When interpreting lab reports (e.g., serum cholesterol), the "normal range" is typically derived from the Mean $\pm$ 2 SD of a healthy population. If a patient's value lies beyond 2 SD (e.g., > 3 SD), it suggests a high probability of pathology rather than chance variation.
