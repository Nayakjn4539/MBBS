# [[NUTRITION AND HEALTH]] > Foods additives

### Definition
Food additives are defined as **non-nutritious substances** added intentionally to food, generally in small quantities, to improve its **appearance, flavor, texture, or storage properties**.
*   This definition also encompasses animal food adjuncts (residues in human food) and components of packing materials that may migrate into the food.
*   [[Food additives]] and [[Food adulteration]] are **not** synonymous, though the use of non-permitted additives constitutes adulteration.

### Classification of Food Additives
Additives are broadly classified into two main categories:

**1. First Category (Generally Safe/Permitted)**
These are intentionally added for specific functions and include:
*   **Coloring agents:** e.g., Saffron, Turmeric.
*   **Flavoring agents:** e.g., Vanilla essence.
*   **Sweeteners:** e.g., Saccharin.
*   **Preservatives:** e.g., Sodium benzoate, Sorbic acid.
*   **Acidity imparting agents:** e.g., Citric acid, Acetic acid.

**2. Second Category (Incidental/Unsafe)**
These are contaminants that enter food through:
*   Packing materials.
*   Processing steps.
*   Farming practices (e.g., Insecticides).
*   Environmental conditions.

### Food Preservatives
Preservatives are capable of inhibiting, retarding, or arresting the process of fermentation, acidification, or other decomposition of food. They are classified into two classes:

| Class I Preservatives (Natural/Traditional) | Class II Preservatives (Chemical) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Common Salt** | **Benzoic acid** |
| **Sugar** (Dextrose, Glucose) | **Sulphurous acid** |
| **Spices** | **Sorbic acid** |
| **Vinegar** (Acetic acid) | **Nitrites and Nitrates** |
| **Honey** | **Propionic acid** |
| **Vegetable oils** | **Nisin** |

### Clinical Relevance and Health Hazards
Uncontrolled or indiscriminate use of food additives may pose significant health hazards.

*   **Carcinogenicity:**
    *   **Nitrosamines:** [[Nitrites]] and nitrates (used in meat preservation) can lead to the production of toxic substances called nitrosamines, which have been implicated in the etiology of **gastric cancer**.
    *   **Saccharin and Cyclamate:** These artificial sweeteners are considered weak bladder carcinogens or co-carcinogens in laboratory animals, though the risk in humans is considered very small.
*   **Brominated Vegetable Oil (BVO):** Used in cold drinks to stabilize cloudiness. It is a known carcinogen and causes heart damage; its use has been **banned** in India.
*   **Mutagenicity:** Food processing involving high temperatures and additives can produce mutagenic compounds.

### Legal Aspects and Regulation
*   **Regulatory Body:** In India, the [[Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)]] regulates the use of additives under the **Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006**.
*   **Adulteration Status:** Any food containing additives that are **not permitted**, or permitted additives **exceeding the permissible limit**, is legally considered **adulterated**.
*   **Labeling:** The nature and quantity of the additive must be printed on the label. If extraneous coloring matter is added, the label must state **"Artificially Coloured"**.
*   **International Standards:** The Joint FAO/WHO **Codex Alimentarius Commission** formulates international standards for food additives to protect consumer health.
