# [[Anatomy And Physiology]] > Binocular Single Vision and Fusion

### **Binocular Single Vision (BSV)**

**Definition**
[[Binocular Single Vision]] (BSV) is the coordinated use of both eyes to produce a single mental impression of the visual world. It is the state of simultaneous vision with two seeing eyes that occurs when an individual fixes their visual attention on an object of regard.

**Development of BSV**
BSV is a conditioned reflex that is not present at birth but is acquired during the first few years of life (the critical period of visual development).
*   **Birth:** No central fixation; eyes move randomly.
*   **1 Month:** [[Fixation reflex]] starts developing.
*   **6 Months:** Macular stereopsis and [[Accommodation reflex]] are fully developed.
*   **6–7 Years:** BSV is well developed and full visual acuity is attained.

### **Prerequisites for Binocular Single Vision**

For BSV to exist, three sets of mechanisms must function efficiently:

1.  **Sensory Mechanisms:**
    *   The visual pathways must be intact.
    *   Images formed on the [[Retina]] of both eyes must be reasonably clear and similar in size and shape (no significant [[Anisometropia]] or [[Aniseikonia]]).
2.  **Motor Mechanisms:**
    *   Precise coordination of the [[Extraocular Muscles]] to maintain the eyes in correct alignment in all directions of gaze.
    *   The visual axes must allow the image of the object of regard to fall on the [[Fovea]] of each eye.
3.  **Central/Mental Mechanisms:**
    *   The [[Visual Cortex]] must have the ability to fuse the two slightly dissimilar images from each eye into a single stereoscopic perception.

### **Mechanism of Fusion and Projection**

**1. Retinal Correspondence**
*   **Normal Retinal Correspondence (NRC):** The fovea of one eye and the fovea of the other eye act as **Corresponding Points**. They share the same subjective visual direction.
    *   Images falling on corresponding points are perceived as single.
    *   Images falling on **Disparate Points** (non-corresponding points) result in [[Diplopia]].

**2. The Horopter**
*   The [[Horopter]] is an imaginary surface in space. Any point on the horopter stimulates corresponding retinal points and is seen as single.

**3. Panum's Fusional Area**
*   This is the zone in front of and behind the horopter where objects stimulate slightly disparate retinal points but are still fused by the brain to be seen as single.
*   **Physiological Diplopia:** Objects located outside [[Panum's Area]] (either much nearer or much farther than the fixation point) fall on disparate points and are seen as double. This is a normal phenomenon.
    *   **Crossed (Heteronymous) Diplopia:** Occurs for near objects when looking at a distant object.
    *   **Uncrossed (Homonymous) Diplopia:** Occurs for distant objects when fixing on a near object.

**Clinical Implication:**
**Physiological diplopia** is usually suppressed by the brain but is essential for the psychological impression of depth.

### **Grades of Binocular Single Vision**

BSV is classically graded into three levels (Worth's Classification), which are best tested using a [[Synoptophore]] (Major Amblyoscope).

| Grade | Name | Definition | Example (Synoptophore Slide) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Grade I** | **Simultaneous Macular Perception (SMP)** | The ability to see two dissimilar objects simultaneously. | A bird is presented to one eye and a cage to the other. The patient sees the bird *in* the cage. |
| **Grade II** | **Fusion** | The ability to superimpose two incomplete but similar images to form one complete image. | Two rabbits, one lacking a tail and the other lacking a flower. The patient fuses them to see one rabbit with *both* a tail and a flower. |
| **Grade III** | **Stereopsis** | The ability to perceive the third dimension (depth) due to horizontal disparity of retinal images. | Two pictures of a bucket taken from slightly different angles. The patient perceives a 3D bucket. |

**Note:** [[Stereopsis]] is the highest grade of binocular vision.

### **Anomalies of Binocular Vision**

When the visual axes are misaligned (Strabismus), the sensory system adapts to avoid double vision.

#### **1. Confusion and Diplopia**
*   **Confusion:** Two different objects fall on the foveae of the two eyes. The brain perceives two different objects at the same location.
*   **Diplopia (Pathological):** The image of the object of regard falls on the fovea of the fixing eye and an extra-foveal point in the deviating eye. The object is seen in two places.

#### **2. Sensory Adaptations (To avoid Diplopia/Confusion)**
*   **[[Suppression]]:** Active cortical inhibition of the image from the squinting eye. It occurs only during binocular viewing.
    *   *Central Suppression:* Inhibits the fovea to avoid confusion.
    *   *Peripheral Suppression:* Inhibits the peripheral retina to avoid diplopia.
*   **[[Amblyopia]] ("Lazy Eye"):** Partial loss of vision in one or both eyes due to lack of use or abnormal binocular interaction during the critical period. Unlike suppression, amblyopia persists even when the good eye is covered.
*   **[[Anomalous Retinal Correspondence]] (ARC):** A neural adaptation where the fovea of the sound eye acquires a common visual direction with an extra-foveal point in the squinting eye.
    *   *Harmonious ARC:* The angle of anomaly equals the objective angle of squint.
    *   *Unharmonious ARC:* The angle of anomaly is less than the objective angle.

### **Tests for Binocular Vision and Fusion**

#### **1. Synoptophore (Major Amblyoscope)**
*   **Principle:** Two cylindrical tubes with mirrors and lenses present slides to each eye separately.
*   **Uses:**
    *   Determines the grade of BSV (I, II, III).
    *   Measures subjective and objective angles of squint.
    *   Detects suppression and ARC.

#### **2. Worth's Four-Dot Test**
*   **Principle:** Dissociates eyes using red/green goggles. The patient views a box with 4 lights: 1 Red, 2 Green, 1 White.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   **4 Lights (1R, 2G, 1 Mixed):** Normal BSV or ARC.
    *   **2 Red Lights:** Left eye suppression (if green lens is on LE).
    *   **3 Green Lights:** Right eye suppression (if red lens is on RE).
    *   **5 Lights (2 Red + 3 Green):** Diplopia.

#### **3. Bagolini Striated Glasses**
*   **Principle:** Lenses with fine striations convert a point light source into a line. It is the least dissociative test (closest to natural seeing conditions).
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   **Cross (X):** Normal BSV or Harmonious ARC.
    *   **One Line:** Suppression.
    *   **Two lines (not crossing):** Diplopia.

#### **4. Tests for Stereopsis**
*   **[[Titmus Fly Test]]:** Uses polaroid vectographs. Gross stereopsis.
*   **[[TNO Test]]:** Uses red-green glasses and random dot stereograms.
*   **[[Randot Test]]:** Uses polarized glasses; eliminates monocular cues.
*   **[[Lang Test]]:** No glasses required; useful for young children.

#### **5. 4 Prism Diopter Base Out Test**
*   **Use:** To detect **Microtropia** (small angle squint) or a central suppression scotoma.
*   **Method:** Place a 4 $\Delta$ prism base-out before one eye.
    *   *Normal:* The eye under the prism moves in (to refixate), and the other eye makes a conjugate movement out, followed by a slow fusional convergence movement back.
    *   *Microtropia/Suppression:* No movement is observed when the prism is placed over the suppressing eye.
