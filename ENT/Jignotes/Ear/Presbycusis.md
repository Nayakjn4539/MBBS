# Presbycusis

**Presbycusis** is defined as the age-related, progressive, bilateral, symmetrical [[sensorineural hearing loss]] (SNHL) associated with the physiological aging process of the auditory system. It is the most common cause of hearing loss in adults.

### Epidemiology and Risk Factors
*   **Age:** Usually manifests after 50 years of age; prevalence increases significantly with age (affects >1/3 of persons over 75 years).
*   **Sex:** Males are affected more frequently and severely than females.
*   **Onset:** Insidious and gradually progressive.
*   **Predisposing Factors:**
    *   **Hereditary:** Genetic predisposition plays a major role.
    *   **Noise Exposure:** Cumulative effect of daily noise exposure (sociocusis).
    *   **Systemic Diseases:** [[Diabetes mellitus]], [[Hypertension]], arteriosclerosis, kidney disease.
    *   **Ototoxic Drugs:** Cumulative effects of drugs like aminoglycosides or cisplatin.
    *   **Diet/Metabolism:** High-fat diet, hyperlipidemia.

### Pathology (Gacek and Schuknecht's Classification)
The pathological changes in presbycusis are classified into four distinct types based on the primary structure of the [[Cochlea]] affected.

**1. Sensory Presbycusis**
*   **Pathology:** Atrophy and degeneration of the [[Organ of Corti]], specifically the loss of outer hair cells and supporting cells. Usually begins at the basal turn (high frequency) and progresses apically.
*   **Audiogram:** Abrupt, precipitous, **down-sloping** high-frequency hearing loss.
*   **Speech Discrimination:** Good/preserved.

**2. Neural Presbycusis**
*   **Pathology:** Degeneration of the [[Spiral Ganglion]] cells and cochlear neurons. Can involve central auditory pathways.
*   **Audiogram:** Down-sloping (variable) but usually shows high-tone loss.
*   **Clinical Feature:** **Phonemic Regression**. This is the hallmark feature where speech discrimination is very poor and out of proportion to the pure tone threshold loss.

**3. Metabolic (Strial) Presbycusis**
*   **Pathology:** Atrophy of the [[Stria Vascularis]]. This disrupts the chemical and bioelectric balance (endocochlear potential) of the [[Endolymph]]. Often familial.
*   **Audiogram:** **Flat** audiometric curve (involving all frequencies equally).
*   **Speech Discrimination:** Excellent/Good.

**4. Mechanical (Cochlear Conductive) Presbycusis**
*   **Pathology:** Thickening and stiffening of the [[Basilar Membrane]] of the cochlea, affecting its motion mechanics.
*   **Audiogram:** Gradual **sloping** (descending) curve.
*   **Speech Discrimination:** Fair to good.

*(Note: Most clinical cases are likely a mixture of these pathological types).*

### Clinical Features
*   **Hearing Loss:** Bilateral, symmetrical, sensorineural, and insidious.
*   **Speech Intelligibility:** The classic complaint is **"I can hear, but I cannot understand."**
    *   **Cocktail Party Effect:** Difficulty is significantly worse in noisy surroundings or crowded rooms due to loss of high-frequency consonant sounds (which carry the meaning of speech).
*   **Recruitment:** A phenomenon where there is an abnormal growth of loudness. Low-intensity sounds are not heard, but loud sounds become intolerable/painful. The patient may say, *"Why are you shouting? I am not deaf."*
*   **Tinnitus:** Frequently present; usually high-pitched, bilateral, and continuous. Can be the presenting complaint.
*   **Vertigo:** Imbalance or disequilibrium may be present in elderly patients (presbyastasis) due to degenerative changes in the vestibular system.

### Diagnosis and Investigations

**1. Otoscopy**
*   **Tympanic Membrane:** Usually normal (pearly white).
*   **External Auditory Canal:** Normal.

**2. Tuning Fork Tests**
*   **Rinne Test:** Positive (AC > BC) bilaterally.
*   **Weber Test:** Centralized (not lateralized) if loss is symmetrical.
*   **Absolute Bone Conduction (ABC):** Reduced in both ears.

**3. Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA)**
*   **Type:** Bilateral [[Sensorineural Hearing Loss]] (no Air-Bone gap).
*   **Configuration:** Usually **down-sloping** (descending) curve, affecting higher frequencies (2000–8000 Hz) more than lower frequencies.
    *   *Exception:* Metabolic presbycusis shows a flat curve.
*   **Symmetry:** Curves are generally symmetrical for both ears.

**4. Speech Audiometry**
*   **Speech Discrimination Score (SDS):** Reduced.
*   **Rollover Phenomenon:** In neural presbycusis, SDS decreases as sound intensity increases (Phonemic regression).

### Differential Diagnosis
Must be differentiated from other causes of bilateral SNHL:
*   **Ototoxicity:** History of drug intake (aminoglycosides, diuretics).
*   **Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL):** History of exposure; Audiogram typically shows a dip/notch at 4000 Hz (**Acoustic Dip** or **Boiler's Notch**).
*   **Bilateral Acoustic Neuroma:** Rare, associated with [[Neurofibromatosis type 2]].

### Treatment and Management
Presbycusis is progressive and not curable, but it is manageable.

**1. Prevention/Prophylaxis**
*   Avoidance of loud noise exposure.
*   Avoidance of [[Ototoxic drugs]].
*   Control of systemic diseases (Diabetes, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia).

**2. Rehabilitation (Mainstay of Treatment)**
*   **Hearing Aids:** The primary modality for rehabilitation. Amplifies sound to make speech audible. Useful when social handicap is present (usually >30-40 dB loss).
*   **Assistive Listening Devices:** For telephone use, TV, etc.
*   **Cochlear Implants:** Indicated for patients with severe to profound hearing loss who do not benefit from conventional hearing aids.

**3. Counseling and Communication Tactics**
*   **Lip Reading/Speech Reading:** Visual cues help in understanding speech.
*   **Psychological Support:** Reassurance regarding the nature of the disease to prevent social isolation and depression.
*   **Auditory Training:** To improve speech discrimination.

**Clinical Implication:**
Since presbycusis primarily affects high frequencies, patients lose the ability to hear consonants (like s, f, t, th). Consonants provide the clarity of speech, while vowels (low frequency) provide the power. Thus, shouting at a presbycusis patient often makes understanding *worse* because it amplifies the low-frequency vowels which mask the already weak high-frequency consonants (upward spread of masking), causing pain due to recruitment without improving clarity.
