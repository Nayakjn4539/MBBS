# Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP)

[[Medical Termination of Pregnancy]] refers to the intentional expulsion of the fetus from the uterus by medical or surgical means before the full term of pregnancy is completed. It is governed in India by the **Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971**, which legalized abortion under specific conditions to ensure the safety and health of women.

### Objectives of the MTP Act
The Act was enacted to regulate the termination of pregnancies by registered medical practitioners and to protect doctors from criminal liability under the Indian Penal Code (specifically Section 312 IPC) when the termination is conducted within the legal framework.

### Indications for MTP
Pregnancy can be terminated under the following conditions (Mnemonic: **THESE**):

1.  **T - Therapeutic:** If the continuation of pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or cause grave injury to her physical or mental health.
2.  **H - Humanitarian:** When the pregnancy is the result of [[Rape]]. The anguish caused by such a pregnancy is presumed to constitute a grave injury to the mental health of the woman.
3.  **E - Eugenic:** If there is a substantial risk that if the child were born, it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped.
4.  **S - Social:** In the case of a married woman, pregnancy occurs as a result of failure of any device or method used by the married woman or her husband for the purpose of limiting the number of children. This constitutes a grave injury to the mental health of the woman.
5.  **E - Environmental:** Considerations regarding the pregnant woman's actual or reasonably foreseeable environment.

### Qualifications of the Doctor (Who can perform MTP?)
Only a qualified [[Registered Medical Practitioner]] (RMP) can perform MTP. The experience required depends on the available facilities and training:
*   A doctor with a postgraduate degree or diploma in Obstetrics and Gynecology.
*   A doctor who has completed six months of house surgency in Obstetrics and Gynecology.
*   A doctor who has at least one year of experience in the practice of Obstetrics and Gynecology at any hospital.
*   A doctor who has assisted a registered medical practitioner in the performance of at least **25 cases** of MTP in a government-recognized hospital.

### Duration of Pregnancy and Medical Opinion
The requirement for medical opinion varies based on the gestational age:

| Gestational Age | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Up to 12 Weeks** | Opinion of **one** Registered Medical Practitioner is sufficient. |
| **12 to 20 Weeks** | Opinion of **two** Registered Medical Practitioners is required (both must agree that indications exist). |
| **Any Duration** | Opinion of **one** RMP is sufficient if the termination is immediately necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman (Emergency). |

> **Note:** Under the MTP Act (as per sources), pregnancy cannot generally be terminated after 20 weeks unless it is to save the life of the mother.

### Consent
*   **Adult Woman (>18 years):** Only the written [[Informed Consent]] of the woman is required. The consent of the husband is **not** necessary.
*   **Minor (<18 years) or Mentally Ill:** Written consent of the **guardian** is mandatory.

### Place of Termination
MTP can only be performed at:
1.  A hospital established or maintained by the Government.
2.  A place approved for the purpose of this Act by the Government/District Chief Medical Officer.

### Methods of Termination
The method selected depends on the gestational age:

| Trimester | Medical Methods | Surgical Methods |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **First Trimester** (Up to 12 weeks) | Mifepristone (RU-486) + Misoprostol<br>Methotrexate + Misoprostol | • Manual Vacuum Aspiration (MVA)<br>• Suction Evacuation and Curettage<br>• Dilatation and Evacuation (D&E) |
| **Second Trimester** (Up to 20 weeks) | Prostaglandins (Intravaginal/IM) | • Dilatation and Evacuation<br>• Intra-amniotic instillation (Hypertonic urea/saline)<br>• Hysterotomy |

### Documentation and Record Keeping
Maintenance of records is a strict legal requirement:
1.  **Form I:** The consent form.
2.  **Form II:** The opinion form certified by the doctor(s).
3.  **Form III:** The admission register. This is a **secret document**.
    *   The register details the patient's name and is kept in safe custody.
    *   Serial numbers are assigned to patients to maintain confidentiality.
    *   Entries must be made within 3 hours of the termination.
    *   Records must be preserved for **5 years**.
    *   A monthly statement is sent to the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) of the district.
    *   Professional secrecy must be maintained; disclosure to unauthorized persons is prohibited.

### Complications
While safer than criminal abortion, MTP carries risks:
*   **Immediate:** Hemorrhage, shock, injury to uterus/cervix (perforation), anesthetic complications.
*   **Delayed:** Sepsis, incomplete abortion, thromboembolism.
*   **Remote:** Secondary infertility, menstrual disturbances.

### Penalties and Offenses
*   Termination by a person who is not a registered medical practitioner: Punishable with rigorous imprisonment for 2 to 7 years.
*   Termination in a place not approved by the government: Punishable with rigorous imprisonment for 2 to 7 years.
*   Failure to maintain secrecy or records: Punishable with fine.

### Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Protection for Doctors:** A doctor acting in good faith under the provisions of the MTP Act is protected from legal action for any damage caused or likely to be caused.
*   **Criminal Abortion:** If the provisions of the MTP Act are not followed (e.g., unqualified person, unapproved place, lack of consent), the act amounts to [[Criminal Abortion]] and is punishable under Sections 312–316 of the Indian Penal Code.
*   **Negligence:** If a patient dies due to lack of reasonable care and skill during MTP, the doctor can be charged with [[Medical Negligence]].
