# [[General Orthopaedics]] > Fracture Healing

### Fracture Healing

Bone is unique among body tissues because it heals by regeneration (replacing original tissue with identical tissue) rather than by repair (replacement with scar tissue). Fracture healing is a continuous process that can be broadly classified into two types based on the mechanical environment and stability of the fracture fixation: **Secondary Healing** (Indirect) and **Primary Healing** (Direct).

---

### 1. Secondary Fracture Healing (Indirect Healing)
This is the natural form of healing seen in fractures treated conservatively (casts, splints, functional braces) or with relative stability (intramedullary nails, external fixators),. It is characterized by the formation of [[callus]] and involves some interfragmentary motion.

The process proceeds through five distinct histologic stages,,:

#### Stage 1: Tissue Destruction and Hematoma Formation
*   **Timeframe:** 0–7 days (Approx. 1–3 days),.
*   **Pathology:** Trauma ruptures blood vessels within the bone (marrow), periosteum, and surrounding soft tissues.
*   **Key Event:** A [[fracture hematoma]] forms around and within the fracture gap.
*   **Biological Response:** Bone ends deprived of blood supply die back for a few millimeters. The hematoma coagulates, acting as a scaffold. Sensitization of precursor cells (osteocytes) occurs to initiate differentiation,.

#### Stage 2: Stage of Inflammation and Granulation Tissue
*   **Timeframe:** 2–3 weeks.
*   **Pathology:** An acute inflammatory reaction occurs. Macrophages and osteoclasts invade to clean up dead bone and debris (necrotic tissue).
*   **Key Event:** Ingrowth of vascular capillary loops and mesenchymal cells. The hematoma is organized and replaced by [[granulation tissue]].
*   **Clinical Note:** The fracture ends become sticky, but there is no structural strength yet.

#### Stage 3: Stage of Callus Formation
*   **Timeframe:** 4–12 weeks (Approx. 1–3 months).
*   **Differentiation:** Mesenchymal cells differentiate into chondroblasts (forming cartilage) and osteoblasts (forming bone) depending on the oxygen tension and mechanical environment.
*   **Soft Callus:** Initially, fibrocartilage bridges the gap.
*   **Hard Callus:** [[Osteoblasts]] lay down a matrix of collagen and polysaccharide, which becomes mineralized to form **[[woven bone]]** (immature bone with random collagen arrangement),.
*   **Clinical Implication:** The fracture becomes clinically united (no movement at the fracture site), but the bone is not yet strong enough for unprotected weight-bearing.

#### Stage 4: Stage of Consolidation
*   **Timeframe:** Months to years.
*   **Key Event:** Woven bone (immature/weak) is replaced by **[[lamellar bone]]** (mature/strong).
*   **Process:** Osteoclasts bore through the debris and woven bone, followed by osteoblasts laying down organized lamellae around central blood vessels (Haversian systems).
*   **Clinical Implication:** The fracture is radiologically united (bridging bone trabeculae visible). The bone is now strong enough for normal function.

#### Stage 5: Stage of Remodeling
*   **Timeframe:** Years.
*   **Principle:** **[[Wolff's Law]]**—Bone is laid down where stresses are high and resorbed where stresses are low,.
*   **Key Event:** The medullary canal is recanalized. The external callus bulge is smoothed away. The bone returns to its original shape and structure.
*   **Note:** Remodeling is very active in children (can correct angular deformities) but limited in adults (cannot correct rotational deformities).

### 2. Primary Fracture Healing (Direct Healing)
This is an artificial form of healing that occurs when the fracture is rigidly fixed (absolute stability) with anatomical reduction (e.g., using compression plates and screws),.

*   **Mechanism:** There is **no interfragmentary strain** or motion. Therefore, **no callus** is formed.
*   **Process:** Healing occurs via direct osteonal remodeling (Haversian remodeling).
    *   **Contact Healing:** Where bone ends touch, osteoclasts forming "cutter heads" tunnel across the fracture line, followed immediately by osteoblasts laying down new vessels and bone (osteons).
    *   **Gap Healing:** In minute gaps (<200 μm), lamellar bone fills the void directly. In slightly larger gaps, woven bone fills it first, followed by remodeling.
*   **Clinical Implication:** Because no callus is visible on X-ray, radiological union is difficult to define. The fracture line simply disappears gradually. The implant takes all the load until full union.

### 3. Healing of Cancellous Bone
*   **Structure:** [[Cancellous bone]] is spongy with a honeycomb lattice and a large surface area.
*   **Mechanism:** Healing occurs via direct osteoblastic activity. Trabeculae are repaired by "creeping substitution" or direct apposition of new bone.
*   **Difference:** There is minimal external callus compared to cortical bone healing because the large contact area usually ensures stability (e.g., impacted metaphyseal fractures).

### 4. Comparison: Primary vs. Secondary Healing

| Feature | Secondary Healing (Indirect) | Primary Healing (Direct) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stability** | Relative stability (Micromotion exists) | Absolute stability (No motion) |
| **Fixation Method** | Casts, Splints, IM Nails, External Fixators | Compression Plates, Lag Screws |
| **Callus Formation** | **Yes** (Abundant) | **No** (Minimal to none) |
| **Mechanism** | Endochondral ossification (Cartilage $\to$ Bone) | Intramembranous / Haversian remodeling |
| **Speed** | Faster biological bridging | Slower mechanical strength gain |
| **Radiology** | Visible callus bridging the gap | Disappearance of fracture line |

### 5. Factors Affecting Fracture Healing
Healing is influenced by biological and mechanical variables,.

#### Favorable Factors
*   **Location:** Metaphyseal fractures (rich blood supply) heal faster than diaphyseal fractures.
*   **Type of Bone:** Cancellous bone heals faster than cortical bone.
*   **Loading:** Micromotion and weight-bearing (Wolff's law) stimulate callus formation.
*   **Patient Age:** Children heal very rapidly.

#### Unfavorable Factors (Causes of Delayed Union/Non-Union)
*   **Local Factors:**
    *   **Infection:** Most common cause of poor healing.
    *   **Ischemia:** Poor blood supply (e.g., [[Fracture Neck of Femur]], Scaphoid, Lower 1/3 Tibia).
    *   **Gap:** Soft tissue interposition or distraction of fragments.
    *   **Instability:** Excessive movement disrupts the callus.
*   **Systemic Factors:**
    *   **Smoking:** Vasoconstriction reduces healing potential.
    *   **Nutrition:** Vitamin D or Calcium deficiency (Rickets/Osteomalacia).
    *   **Medications:** NSAIDs (inhibit prostaglandins necessary for healing), Steroids.
    *   **Diseases:** Diabetes, Anemia, Osteoporosis.

### 6. Clinical & Radiological Signs of Union

**Clinical Union:**
*   No tenderness at the fracture site.
*   No pain on loading or stress.
*   No abnormal mobility.

**Radiological Union (Consolidation):**
*   **Secondary Healing:** Visible bridging callus across the fracture site in at least 3 out of 4 cortices on AP and Lateral views,.
*   **Primary Healing:** Obliteration of the fracture line.
