# [[Irritant Poisons (Organic)]] > Calotropis and Semecarpus

# Calotropis (Madar/Akdo)

**General Description**
*   **Botanical Names:** *Calotropis gigantea* (Purple flowers) and *Calotropis procera* (White flowers).
*   **Common Names:** Madar, Akdo, Giant Milkweed.
*   **Appearance:** A tall shrub growing wild in wastelands. It has thick fleshy leaves. When leaves or stems are broken, an acrid, milky white latex exudes.
*   **Toxic Parts:** All parts are poisonous, especially the **milky juice (latex)** and the **root bark**. The root of *C. procera* is highly toxic to cobras.

**Active Principles**
The milky latex contains several active principles:
1.  **Uscharin**
2.  **Calotoxin**
3.  **Calotropin**
4.  **Calactin**
5.  **Gigantin**

**Mechanism of Action**
*   **Local:** Highly irritant to skin and mucous membranes. It acts as a vesicant.
*   **Systemic:** It acts as a **cardiac poison** (digitalis-like action) and also has neurotoxic effects causing convulsions. The active principles are cardio-active glycosides.

**Clinical Features**
*   **Local Contact:**
    *   **Skin:** Redness, inflammation, and vesication (blisters). It may resemble a burn or [[artificial bruise]].
    *   **Eyes:** Severe conjunctivitis, corneal ulceration, and potential blindness (prevalent in folk medicine or accidental splashing).
    *   **Hunan Hand:** A condition of contact dermatitis seen in vegetable handlers (specifically chilli), but also associated with Calotropis handling.
*   **Ingestion:**
    *   Bitter taste in the mouth with a burning sensation in the throat and stomach.
    *   Stomatitis (inflammation of the mouth).
    *   **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, persistent vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.
    *   **Neurological:** Dilated pupils (mydriasis), tetanic convulsions, delirium, and collapse.
    *   **Cardiac:** Slow and irregular pulse, eventually leading to heart failure.

**Fatal Dose and Period**
*   **Fatal Dose:** Uncertain, but a few drops of concentrated juice or crushed root bark can be fatal.
*   **Fatal Period:** 6 to 12 hours.

**Treatment**
1.  **Stomach wash** with warm water or potassium permanganate.
2.  **Demulcents** (egg white, milk, oil) to soothe the mucosa.
3.  **Symptomatic treatment:** Morphine for pain, fluids for dehydration.
4.  **Eye exposure:** Wash immediately with saline/water; atropine drops and corticosteroids may be needed.

**Postmortem Appearances**
*   **External:** Vesicles or inflammation at the site of contact. Froth at the mouth/nostrils.
*   **Internal:**
    *   Signs of potent **gastrointestinal irritation**: Inflammation, congestion, and ulcers in the stomach.
    *   Congestion of visceral organs (brain, liver, kidneys).
    *   [[Subendocardial hemorrhages]] may be seen.

**Medicolegal Aspects**
*   **Cattle Poison:** The leaves or juice are mixed with fodder to kill cattle.
*   **Infanticide:** The milky juice is placed in the infant's mouth or mixed with milk.
*   **Criminal Abortion:** An **abortion stick** (a twig of the plant or cotton wrapped on a stick soaked in the juice) is inserted into the [[cervical os]] to induce labor contractions.
*   **Artificial Bruise:** The juice is applied to the skin to create lesions that mimic bruises to support a false charge of assault.
*   **Arrow Poison:** Historically used by tribals.
*   **Accidental:** Quacks use it for treating rheumatism, snake bites, or worms, leading to accidental overdose.

# Semecarpus anacardium (Marking Nut)

**General Description**
*   **Common Names:** Bhilawa, Dhobi’s nut, Malacca bean.
*   **Appearance:** A heart-shaped nut, black in color, with a rough projection at the base.
*   **Juice:** The thick cellular pericarp contains a brownish, oily, acrid juice which **turns black on exposure to air**.
*   **Use:** Traditionally used by washermen (Dhobis) to mark clothes (hence the name).

**Active Principles**
1.  **Semecarpol** (Monohydroxy phenol)
2.  **Bhilawanol** (O-dihydroxy compound)

**Mechanism of Action**
*   It is a powerful **irritant** and **vesicant** (blister-causing agent).
*   Penetrates tissues deeply.

**Clinical Features**
*   **External Application:**
    *   Causes a painful blister containing acrid serum.
    *   Surrounding skin becomes inflamed, eczematous, and itchy.
    *   The lesion resembles a [[bruise]] but can be distinguished (see table below).
*   **Ingestion:**
    *   Blisters in the mouth and throat.
    *   Severe gastrointestinal irritation: vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea (often with blood).
    *   **Systemic:** Cyanosis, dyspnea, tachycardia, hypotension, delirium, coma, and death.

**Fatal Dose and Period**
*   **Fatal Dose:** 5 to 10 grams (whole nut) or 10-20 drops of juice.
*   **Fatal Period:** 12 to 24 hours.

**Treatment**
1.  **Skin Contact:** Wash thoroughly with warm water, soap, or alcohol to remove the oil. Apply bland liniments.
2.  **Ingestion:**
    *   Gastric lavage with warm water.
    *   Demulcents (milk, butter, ghee).
    *   IV fluids and electrolytes for shock.
    *   Morphine for pain.

**Postmortem Appearances**
*   **External:** Blisters on the skin, lips, or mouth. The skin may show black discoloration.
*   **Internal:** Mucosa of the esophagus and stomach is swollen, congested, and inflamed. The stomach contents may be dark/blackish. Viscera (liver, kidneys) are congested.

**Medicolegal Aspects**
1.  **Artificial Bruise:** The most common medicolegal importance. The juice is applied to simulate contusions to support a false charge of assault.
2.  **Vitriloage:** The juice acts as a corrosive and can be thrown on the face.
3.  **Criminal Abortion:** Juice is applied to the abortion stick.
4.  **Punishment:** In some rural areas, the juice is introduced into the vagina as a punishment for infidelity.
5.  **Malingering:** Applied to eyes to produce conjunctivitis (ophthalmia).

### Distinction: True Bruise vs. Artificial Bruise (Bhilawa)

| Feature | True Bruise ([[Contusion]]) | Artificial Bruise (Semecarpus) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cause** | Blunt force trauma | Chemical irritant (Bhilawa/Calotropis) |
| **Site** | Anywhere (usually exposed parts) | Accessible parts only (fingertips often stained) |
| **Shape** | Round or irregular | Irregular, bizarre, or finger-patterned |
| **Color Change** | **Present** (color changes of bruise) | **Absent** (remains dark/blackish) |
| **Margins** | Diffuse | Regular, well-defined |
| **Inflammation** | Mild | Intense redness and swelling |
| **Vesicles/Blisters** | **Absent** | **Present** (Acrid serum) |
| **Itching** | Absent (usually painful/tender) | **Present** and severe |
| **Chemical Test** | Negative for chemicals | Positive for specific chemical |
| **Hair** | Hair bulb intact | Hair may be destroyed/shed |

> **Mnemonic for Semecarpus:** **S**emecarpus **B**hilawa causes **S**evere **B**listers and **B**lack **S**tains (Artificial **B**ruise).
