# [[Neck Surgery]] > Direct Laryngoscopy

### Direct Laryngoscopy

**Direct Laryngoscopy (DLS)** refers to the direct visualization of the [[larynx]] and [[hypopharynx]] using a rigid laryngoscope. It is a fundamental procedure in ENT surgery for both diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic intervention.

---

### Classification

*   **Direct Heterostatic Laryngoscopy:** The laryngoscope is held by the examiner/surgeon.
*   **Direct Autostatic Laryngoscopy (Suspension Laryngoscopy):** The laryngoscope is fixed to a chest support, allowing "autofixation." This frees both hands of the surgeon for operative procedures and is used in [[Microlaryngoscopy]],.

---

### Indications

#### 1. Diagnostic Indications
*   **Failed Indirect Laryngoscopy:** When [[Indirect Laryngoscopy]] (IDL) is not possible or successful due to:
    *   Infants and young children.
    *   Excessive gag reflex.
    *   Overhanging [[epiglottis]] (omega-shaped) obscuring the view.
    *   Anatomical abnormalities (short neck, thick tongue).
*   **Examination of "Hidden Areas":** To visualize areas not seen on mirror examination,,:
    *   Infrahyoid epiglottis.
    *   [[Anterior Commissure]].
    *   [[Laryngeal Ventricle]].
    *   [[Subglottis]].
    *   Apex of the [[Pyriform Fossa]].
*   **Tumor Assessment:** To determine the exact extent of a growth and obtain a biopsy for histopathological confirmation,.
*   **Unknown Primary:** To rule out a primary malignancy in the larynx or hypopharynx in cases of cervical metastasis of unknown origin.
*   **Trauma:** Assessing laryngeal trauma, such as fractures or separation.
*   **Stridor:** Evaluation of noisy breathing in infants and children (e.g., laryngomalacia, webs).
*   **Vocal Cord Palsy:** To assess the mobility of the [[arytenoid cartilage]] using a probe (cricoarytenoid joint fixation vs. nerve palsy).

#### 2. Therapeutic Indications
*   **Benign Lesions:** Removal of [[vocal nodules]], [[vocal polyp]], cysts, papilloma, or fibroma,.
*   **Foreign Body Removal:** Removal of foreign bodies from the larynx or hypopharynx,.
*   **Strictures:** Dilatation of laryngeal strictures or webs,.
*   **Injection Laryngoplasty:** Injection of Teflon or Gelfoam for vocal cord palsy.
*   **Intubation:** Routine endotracheal intubation (using Macintosh laryngoscope).
*   **Laser Surgery:** For excision of lesions using [[CO2 laser]].

---

### Contraindications

*   **Cervical Spine Pathology:** Fracture, dislocation, instability (e.g., Down’s syndrome), or diseases like cervical spondylosis/caries spine where manipulation can lead to quadriplegia,,.
*   **Severe Respiratory Obstruction:** Moderate or marked [[stridor]] is a relative contraindication unless the airway has been secured by a [[tracheostomy]] first, as the procedure may precipitate total obstruction,,.
*   **Cardiovascular Instability:** Recent coronary occlusion, cardiac decompensation, or aneurysm of the aorta,.
*   **Trismus:** Inadequate mouth opening or TMJ ankylosis makes the procedure technically difficult or impossible.

---

### Anesthesia and Position

#### Anesthesia
*   **General Anesthesia (GA):** Preferred for most procedures. It provides relaxation and prevents laryngospasm.
    *   Techniques include using a small cuffed endotracheal tube (MLT tube) or jet ventilation.
*   **Local Anesthesia (LA):** Can be used in cooperative adults.
    *   Involves topical sprays (Xylocaine) and nerve blocks (Internal laryngeal nerve block via pyriform fossa or Superior laryngeal nerve block).
*   **No Anesthesia:** Diagnostic DLS in infants and young children may be performed without anesthesia.

#### Position
*   **Position Name:** **"Sniffing the Morning Air"** position (also known as **Boyce position**, **Chevalier Jackson position**, or **Barking Dog position**),,,,.
*   **Anatomical Configuration:**
    *   **Flexion** of the cervical spine (neck).
    *   **Extension** at the atlanto-occipital joint (head),,,.
*   **Setup:** The head is elevated 10–15 cm by placing a pillow or head ring under the occiput,,.
*   **Rationale:** This aligns the axes of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx into a straight line.

### Instruments

#### Types of Laryngoscopes
1.  **Chevalier Jackson Type:** Distal illumination (bulb at the tip). Advantage: Unobstructed lumen. Disadvantage: Fogging due to secretions,.
2.  **Negus Type:** Proximal twin illumination. Advantage: Bright light, no fogging. Disadvantage: Heavy,.
3.  **Anterior Commissure Laryngoscope (Holinger):** Has a narrower tip to visualize the anterior commissure and subglottis,.
4.  **Kleinsasser Suspension Laryngoscope:** Self-retaining scope used for microlaryngoscopy.
5.  **Macintosh Laryngoscope:** Curved blade used for intubation.

---

### Procedure Technique

1.  **Protection:** A gauze piece or tooth guard is placed on the upper teeth to protect them from trauma,,.
2.  **Lubrication:** The scope is lubricated with jelly or liquid paraffin.
3.  **Holding the Scope:** The laryngoscope handle is held in the **left hand** (even by right-handed surgeons). The right hand is used to retract the lips, guide the scope, and handle instruments,,,.
4.  **Insertion:**
    *   Introduce the scope into the **right side** of the mouth,.
    *   Advance over the tongue and sweep the tongue to the **midline/left**,.
5.  **Landmarks:**
    *   First landmark: **[[Uvula]]**.
    *   Second (most important) landmark: **[[Epiglottis]]**.
6.  **Exposure:**
    *   Identify the tip of the epiglottis.
    *   Advance the tip of the blade into the vallecula (Macintosh) or lift the epiglottis directly (Jackson/Negus).
    *   Lift the epiglottis forward by pressing against the **hyoepiglottic ligament**.
    *   **Crucial:** Lift in the direction of the handle (upwards and forwards) **without levering** on the upper teeth,.
7.  **Inspection:** Visualize the interior of the larynx. Angled rigid telescopes (0°, 30°, 70°) can be passed through the lumen to inspect the ventricles and subglottis,.

### Microlaryngoscopy (MLS)

This combines direct laryngoscopy with an operating microscope,.

*   **Instrumentation:** Uses a self-retaining laryngoscope (e.g., Kleinsasser) fixed with a chest support,.
*   **Advantages (Mnemonic: HIM):**
    *   **H**ands-free: Both hands of the surgeon are free for instrumentation,.
    *   **I**llumination: Improved lighting from the microscope,.
    *   **M**agnification: Allows precise visualization of pathology and extent of invasion,.
*   **Clinical Utility:**
    *   Precise excision of benign lesions (polyps, nodules) preserving the vocal ligament.
    *   Stripping of vocal cords (e.g., in [[Reinke's edema]]).
    *   **Supravital Staining:** Using 1% Toluidine blue to differentiate carcinoma in situ (stains blue) from leukoplakia (does not stain),,.
    *   [[CO2 Laser]] surgery.

---

### Complications

*   **Dental Injury:** Fracture or dislodgement of teeth (most common),. *Management:* If a tooth is dislodged, chest X-ray and bronchoscopy may be needed to retrieve it.
*   **Soft Tissue Injury:** Lacerations to lips, tongue, palate, or pharynx,.
*   **Hemorrhage:** From the biopsy site,.
*   **Airway Compromise:**
    *   Laryngeal edema,.
    *   Laryngospasm.
*   **Arytenoid Dislocation:** Due to forceful instrumentation.
*   **Cardiovascular:** Bradycardia, arrhythmia, or cardiac arrest due to vagal stimulation (reflex),.
*   **Pneumothorax:** Associated with jet ventilation.

---

### Post-Operative Care

*   **Position:** Patient is placed in the **lateral position (tonsillar/coma position)** until fully awake to prevent aspiration of blood or secretions,.
*   **Monitoring:** Watch for signs of respiratory distress, stridor, or bleeding (spitting of blood),.
*   **Voice Rest:** Advised for a few days to promote healing, especially after phonosurgery,.
*   **Diet:** Clear fluids followed by soft diet once the patient is fully recovered from anesthesia and has no risk of aspiration.
