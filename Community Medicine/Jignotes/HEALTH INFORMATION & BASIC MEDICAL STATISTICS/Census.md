# [[HEALTH INFORMATION & BASIC MEDICAL STATISTICS]] > Census

### Census

**Census** is the most important source of health information and provides the primary database for a country's population. It is defined by the United Nations as:
> *"The total process of collecting, compiling and publishing demographic, economic and social data pertaining at a specified time or times, to all persons in a country or delimited territory."*

#### **Key Features**
*   **Universal Coverage:** It covers *every* individual in the country or a specific territory.
*   **Periodicity:** It is conducted at regular intervals. In India, it is a **decadal** exercise (conducted every **10 years**).
*   **Simultaneity:** The count is taken at a specific point in time (Census Moment).
*   **Defined Territory:** It pertains to a precisely defined geographic area.

#### **Legal Framework and Authority**
*   **Legal Basis:** Conducted under the **[[Census Act, 1948]]**.
*   **Nodal Ministry:** Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India.
*   **Supreme Officer:** The **[[Registrar General and Census Commissioner]]** of India heads the operation.

#### **Methods of Enumeration**
There are two main systems of conducting a census:
| System | Description | Status in India |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **De Facto** (Date System) | Persons are counted where they are found on the census night, regardless of their usual residence. | Used till 1931. |
| **De Jure** (Resident System) | Persons are counted at their place of **permanent residence**, regardless of where they are on the census night. | Followed since 1941. |

**[[Census Moment]]**: The "snapshot" of the population is taken at a specific reference time. In India, the **Census Stop** is **00:00 hours on 1st March** of the census year.

#### **Information Collected**
A census is not just a head count; it is a mine of information including:
1.  **Demographic Data:** Total population, age, sex, marital status.
2.  **Social Data:** Literacy, education, language, religion, caste (introduced in 2011).
3.  **Economic Data:** Occupation, employment status, income.
4.  **Fertility Data:** Age at marriage, number of children born (vital for calculating fertility rates).
5.  **Housing/Amenities:** Source of drinking water, type of house, electricity, sanitation.

#### **Uses of Census in Medicine and Public Health**
The census is the central pillar for health planning. Its uses can be remembered using the Mnemonic **"PRIME"**:

*   **P - Planning:** Essential for socio-economic planning and planning of health services (e.g., how many hospitals, schools, or vaccines are needed).
*   **R - Rates & Ratios:** It provides the **[[Denominator]]** for calculating vital rates (Birth Rate, Death Rate) and morbidity indicators. Without census data, these rates cannot be computed accurately.
*   **I - Indices:** Helps in calculating health indices like Life Expectancy and fertility rates.
*   **M - Monitoring:** Helps track population growth (Growth Rate) and demographic trends (e.g., Sex Ratio decline).
*   **E - Estimation:** Used to estimate the mid-year population for inter-censal years using arithmetical progression.

#### **Census of India 2011 (Key Facts)**
*   **Sequence:** 15th Census since 1872 and 7th after Independence.
*   **Slogan:** *"Our Census, Our Future"*.
*   **New Feature:** Introduction of **Biometrics** (fingerprints, iris scan) and the **National Population Register (NPR)**.
*   **Population:** 1210.1 million.
*   **Sex Ratio:** 943 females per 1000 males (Child Sex Ratio: 919).
*   **Literacy Rate:** 74.04% (Males: 82.14%, Females: 65.46%).
*   **Density:** 382 persons per sq. km.

#### **Limitations**
*   **Time Lag:** Analysis takes several years; full results are not available quickly.
*   **Missing Data:** People may be missed (e.g., homeless, floating population) or counted twice.
*   **Errors:** Misreporting of age (digit preference for numbers ending in 0 or 5) and concealment of facts due to lack of rapport.
