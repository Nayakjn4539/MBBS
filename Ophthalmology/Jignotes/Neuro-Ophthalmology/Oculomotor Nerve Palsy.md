# [[Neuro-Ophthalmology]] > Oculomotor Nerve Palsy

# [[Oculomotor Nerve Palsy]] (Third Cranial Nerve)

### 1. Anatomical Basis
The [[Oculomotor Nerve]] (CN III) is the chief motor nerve of the eye. Understanding its complex nuclear arrangement and course is vital for localizing lesions.

#### Nuclear Complex
Located in the **Midbrain** at the level of the [[Superior Colliculus]], ventral to the [[Aqueduct of Sylvius]]. It consists of sub-nuclei:
*   **Levator Subnucleus:** Single, unpaired, caudal midline nucleus. (Lesion here causes **Bilateral Ptosis**).
*   **Superior Rectus Subnucleus:** Paired, but fibers decussate. Innervates the **Contralateral** muscle.
*   **Medial Rectus, Inferior Rectus, Inferior Oblique:** Paired, innervate **Ipsilateral** muscles.
*   **Edinger-Westphal Nucleus:** Parasympathetic accessory nucleus. Controls [[Sphincter Pupillae]] (constriction) and [[Ciliary Muscle]] (accommodation).

#### Course of the Nerve
1.  **Fascicular Part:** Fibers pass through the [[Red Nucleus]] and medial aspect of the [[Cerebral Peduncle]].
2.  **Basilar Part:** Exits midbrain in the interpeduncular fossa. Passes between the **Posterior Cerebral Artery** and **Superior Cerebellar Artery**.
    *   *Clinical Note:* This site is prone to compression by [[Posterior Communicating Artery]] aneurysms.
3.  **Intracavernous Part:** Runs in the lateral wall of the [[Cavernous Sinus]] (above the Trochlear nerve).
4.  **Intraorbital Part:** Enters orbit through the [[Superior Orbital Fissure]] (within the [[Annulus of Zinn]]) and divides into:
    *   **Superior Division:** Supplies [[Superior Rectus]] and [[Levator Palpebrae Superioris]].
    *   **Inferior Division:** Supplies [[Medial Rectus]], [[Inferior Rectus]], and [[Inferior Oblique]]. (Parasympathetic fibers travel with the nerve to the Inferior Oblique to reach the [[Ciliary Ganglion]]).

### 2. Clinical Features
A complete third nerve palsy presents with a dramatic and easily recognizable clinical picture.

**Symptoms:**
*   **Diplopia:** Binocular, crossed diplopia (disappears if ptosis covers the pupil).
*   **Ptosis:** Drooping of the eyelid.
*   **Blurring of vision:** Due to loss of accommodation (near vision difficulty).

**Signs (The "Down and Out" Eye):**
*   **Ptosis:** Complete, due to paralysis of [[Levator Palpebrae Superioris]].
*   **Ocular Deviation:** The eye is deviated **Outward (Exotropia)** and **Downward (Hypotropia)**.
    *   *Mechanism:* Unopposed action of the [[Lateral Rectus]] (CN VI - Abduction) and [[Superior Oblique]] (CN IV - Depression/Intorsion).
*   **Restricted Movements:** Limitation of Adduction, Elevation, and Depression.
*   **Pupil:** Fixed and Dilated ([[Mydriasis]]). Loss of light and near reflexes (Internal Ophthalmoplegia).
*   **Accommodation:** Lost (Cycloplegia).
*   **Head Posture:** Head may be turned to the opposite side to compensate for diplopia (if ptosis is incomplete).

### 3. The Pupil Rule: Surgical vs. Medical Palsy
Differentiation between surgical (compressive) and medical (ischemic) causes is critical.

| Feature | **Surgical Third Nerve Palsy** | **Medical Third Nerve Palsy** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pathology** | Compression (e.g., Aneurysm, Tumor, Uncal Herniation) | Microvascular Ischemia (e.g., [[Diabetes Mellitus]], [[Hypertension]]) |
| **Mechanism** | Compresses superficial fibers first. | Affects deep **Vasa Nervorum**, causing central nerve infarction. |
| **Pupil Status** | **Pupil Involved** (Dilated/Fixed). | **Pupil Spared** (Normal reflexes). |
| **Reason** | Pupillomotor fibers are located **superficially** on the nerve trunk. | Superficial fibers receive collateral pial blood supply and are spared. |
| **Pain** | Often painful. | Often painful (retro-orbital pain). |
| **Urgency** | **Emergency!** (Rule out PCA aneurysm). | Generally self-limiting (resolves in 3-6 months). |

*   **Clinical Implication:** A painful third nerve palsy with pupil involvement is a **Posterior Communicating Artery Aneurysm** until proven otherwise.

### 4. Brainstem Syndromes (Fascicular Lesions)
Lesions within the midbrain affect the fascicles of the nerve and adjacent structures.

| Syndrome | Lesion Site | Clinical Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Weber’s Syndrome** | Cerebral Peduncle | Ipsilateral CN III palsy + **Contralateral Hemiplegia**. |
| **Benedikt’s Syndrome** | Red Nucleus | Ipsilateral CN III palsy + **Contralateral Tremors/Involuntary movements**. |
| **Nothnagel’s Syndrome** | Superior Cerebellar Peduncle | Ipsilateral CN III palsy + **Ipsilateral Cerebellar Ataxia**. |
| **Claude's Syndrome** | Combined | Features of both Benedikt’s and Nothnagel’s syndromes. |

### 5. Aberrant Regeneration (Synkinesis)
If the nerve is damaged (usually trauma or compression, rarely ischemic), fibers may regenerate and connect to the wrong muscles. This leads to paradoxical movements.

**Common Signs:**
*   **Pseudo-Graefe Sign:** Retraction/elevation of the upper eyelid on attempted downgaze (Lid gaze dyskinesis).
    *   *Mechanism:* Fibers meant for Inferior Rectus innervate Levator Palpebrae Superioris.
*   **Pseudo-Argyll Robertson Pupil:** Pupil constricts on adduction or convergence but not to light.
    *   *Mechanism:* Fibers meant for Medial Rectus innervate Sphincter Pupillae.

### 6. Etiology
*   **Vascular/Ischemic (Commonest):** Diabetes, Hypertension, Giant Cell Arteritis (Pupil sparing).
*   **Aneurysm:** Posterior communicating artery aneurysm (Painful, Pupil involving).
*   **Trauma:** Head injury, extradural hematoma (Uncal herniation causing compression against tentorial edge—Hutchinson’s pupil).
*   **Tumors:** Pituitary adenoma, Meningioma, Nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
*   **Infections:** Basal meningitis (TB, Syphilis), Cavernous sinus thrombosis.
*   **Ophthalmoplegic Migraine:** Recurrent transient palsy in children.

### 7. Management

**Investigation:**
1.  **Complete Ocular Exam:** Check pupils, motility, fundus.
2.  **Systemic Workup:** Blood pressure, blood sugar, lipid profile (for ischemic causes).
3.  **Neuroimaging:**
    *   **MRI/MRA (Magnetic Resonance Angiography):** Gold standard if pupil is involved, history of trauma, or multiple nerve palsies.
    *   **CT Angiography:** To rule out aneurysms.

**Treatment:**
*   **Medical (Ischemic):**
    *   Control risk factors (Diabetes, HTN).
    *   Observation: Most recover spontaneously in 3–6 months.
    *   Occlusion of the affected eye or prisms to manage diplopia.
*   **Surgical:**
    *   **Aneurysm:** Neurosurgical clipping or coiling.
    *   **Strabismus Surgery:** Considered only after 6 months of non-recovery.
        *   Techniques: Recession-Resection procedures or Transposition surgeries (to center the eye).
    *   **Ptosis Correction:** [[Frontalis Sling]] surgery or Levator resection (if function remains).

**Mnemonics:**
*   **LR6SO4**: Lateral Rectus (CN 6), Superior Oblique (CN 4), All others (CN 3).
*   **Rule of Pupils**:
    *   **S**urgical = **S**uperficial fibers = **S**phincter affected (**S**truck pupil).
    *   **M**edical = **M**iddle fibers (core) = **M**icrovascular = Pupil **M**issed (Spared).
