# [[Surgeries In Ophthalmology]] > Evisceration

# Evisceration

**Evisceration** is a surgical procedure involving the removal of the entire intraocular contents (uvea, retina, vitreous, lens) while preserving the [[sclera]], [[extraocular muscles]], and the [[optic nerve]]. The scleral shell is left intact, unlike [[enucleation]] where the entire globe is removed.

### Definition and Types
*   **Simple Evisceration:** Removal of contents leaving the sclera intact.
*   **Frill Evisceration (Preferred):** A modification where a collar or frill of sclera (approx. 3 mm) is left around the optic nerve, but the rest of the sclera is retained. This is generally preferred over simple evisceration.

### Indications and Contraindications

| **Indications** | **Absolute Contraindications** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Panophthalmitis]]** (To prevent meningitis via optic nerve sheath) | **[[Intraocular Tumors]]** (e.g., Retinoblastoma, Malignant Melanoma) - Risk of metastasis |
| **[[Endophthalmitis]]** (Unresponsive to medical management with no PL) | **Sympathetic Ophthalmia Risk** (Severe trauma where uveal tissue might remain) |
| **[[Expulsive Choroidal Hemorrhage]]** | |
| **Bleeding Anterior Staphyloma** | |
| **Phthisis Bulbi** (Painful blind eye) | |

> **Clinical Implication:** [[Evisceration]] is generally contraindicated in suspected intraocular malignancies because leaving the sclera may leave tumor cells behind, leading to recurrence or metastasis. It is also avoided in trauma with a risk of [[Sympathetic Ophthalmia]] because retaining uveal tissue fragments can trigger an autoimmune response in the fellow eye.

### Instrumentation for Evisceration

The following instruments are essential for performing the surgery:

#### 1. Eye Speculums
*   **Universal Metallic Eye Speculum:** Used to keep the eyelids apart to expose the surgical field. It has a screw mechanism to adjust the width.
*   **Wire Speculum:** A lighter alternative that exerts minimal pressure on the globe.

#### 2. Scalpel Handle and Blade
*   **Bard-Parker Handle:** Usually No. 3 handle fitted with a No. 11 blade or a No. 15 blade.
*   **Razor Blade Fragment Holder:** Often used with a razor fragment to make the initial incision at the limbus or to perform the keratectomy.

#### 3. Conjunctival and Corneal Scissors
*   **Plain Curved Scissors:** Used for peritomy (separating conjunctiva from the limbus).
*   **Corneal Scissors (Section Enlarging Scissors):** Used to excise the cornea after the initial stab incision is made.

#### 4. Evisceration Spoon or Scoop (Curette)
*   **[[Evisceration Scoop]]:** This is a specialized instrument consisting of an oval or rounded shallow cup with blunt margins attached to a stout handle.
*   **Use:** It is introduced between the sclera and the uveal tract to scoop out the entire intraocular contents (uvea, retina, vitreous, lens).
*   **Evisceration Spatula:** Sometimes used to separate the uveal tissue from the sclera before scooping.

#### 5. Artery Forceps (Hemostatic Forceps)
*   **Mosquito Forceps:** Small, curved or straight forceps used to catch bleeding vessels or to hold gauze packs for hemostasis inside the scleral shell.

#### 6. Needle Holder
*   **Types:** Arruga’s, Silcock’s, or Castroviejo’s needle holder.
*   **Use:** To hold the needle while suturing the sclera and conjunctiva during closure.

### Surgical Technique (Frill Evisceration)

The procedure is typically performed under **General Anesthesia** or **Peribulbar Anesthesia**.

1.  **Peritomy:** The conjunctiva is incised 360 degrees at the limbus using conjunctival scissors and separated from the sclera.
2.  **Keratectomy (Removal of Cornea):**
    *   An incision is made at the limbus (usually superiorly) using a scalpel (razor blade or No. 11 blade).
    *   The incision is extended 360 degrees using corneal scissors to completely remove the cornea.
3.  **Removal of Contents:**
    *   An **[[Evisceration Spatula]]** is passed between the sclera and the uveal tract to separate the ciliary body and choroid from the sclera.
    *   An **[[Evisceration Scoop]]** is inserted to scoop out all intraocular contents (lens, vitreous, retina, uvea) in one mass if possible.
4.  **Hemostasis and Cleaning:**
    *   The scleral shell is packed with hot gauze or gauze soaked in adrenaline/saline held by **Artery Forceps** to achieve hemostasis.
    *   The interior is inspected thoroughly to ensure *no pigment/uveal tissue* remains (to prevent [[Sympathetic Ophthalmia]]). The interior is scrubbed with absolute alcohol or antibiotic solution in some protocols.
5.  **Implant Placement:** An orbital implant (e.g., PMMA, Hydroxyapatite) is placed within the scleral shell to maintain volume and motility.
6.  **Closure:**
    *   The sclera is sutured over the implant (if placed) or closed horizontally.
    *   The Tenon’s capsule and conjunctiva are sutured in separate layers using the **Needle Holder**.

### Post-Operative Care and Rehabilitation

*   **Pressure Bandage:** Applied for 24–48 hours to prevent edema and hemorrhage.
*   **Medication:** Systemic antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs.
*   **Prosthesis:** A conformer is placed initially. A customized **[[Artificial Eye]]** (Prosthesis) is fitted after about 6 weeks when edema subsides and the socket heals.

### Advantages over Enucleation
*   **Better Motility:** The extraocular muscles remain attached to the sclera, providing better movement to the artificial eye.
*   **Cosmesis:** Less orbital volume loss compared to enucleation.
*   **Simple Technique:** Faster and less disruption of orbital anatomy.

### Disadvantages
*   **Risk of Sympathetic Ophthalmia:** If uveal pigment is left behind.
*   **Contraindicated in Tumors:** Cannot be used for retinoblastoma or melanoma.

*   **E** - **E**xpulsive Hemorrhage
*   **B** - **B**leeding Anterior Staphyloma
