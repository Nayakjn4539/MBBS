# [[Agricultural Poisons]] > Carbamates and Organochlorines

Based on the provided sources, here is the detailed information regarding **Carbamates** and **Organochlorines** under Agricultural Poisons.

---

### **Carbamates**

Carbamates are esters of carbamic acid or N-methyl carbamic acid. They are widely used as insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides. They share a similar toxicological profile with Organophosphates (OPs) but with key differences in mechanism and duration.

#### **1. Examples and Commercial Names**
*   **Carbaryl:** Sevin, Hexavin.
*   **Propoxur:** Baygon.
*   **Aldicarb:** Temik.
*   **Carbofuran:** Furadan.
*   **Aminocarb:** Matacil.

#### **2. Mechanism of Action**
*   **Reversible Inhibition:** Like OPs, carbamates inhibit the enzyme **Acetylcholinesterase (AChE)**. However, the binding is via **carbamylation** (not phosphorylation).
*   **Duration:** The bond between the carbamate and the enzyme is unstable and hydrolyzes spontaneously (decamylation) relatively quickly (usually within 24–48 hours).
*   **"Aging":** The phenomenon of "aging" (permanent enzyme inactivation) seen in OP poisoning **does not occur** with carbamates.
*   **Effect:** Accumulation of [[Acetylcholine]] at muscarinic and nicotinic receptors leads to cholinergic overstimulation.

#### **3. Clinical Features**
The clinical presentation is similar to OP poisoning but generally **milder and of shorter duration**.
*   **Muscarinic Effects (DUMBELS):** Diarrhea, Urination, Miosis (constricted pupils), Bradycardia/Bronchorrhea, Emesis, Lacrimation, Salivation.
*   **Nicotinic Effects:** Muscle fasciculations, weakness, paralysis.
*   **CNS Effects:** Confusion, convulsions, coma (though CNS penetration varies; some carbamates cross the blood-brain barrier poorly compared to OPs).

#### **4. Fatal Dose and Period**
*   **Fatal Dose:** Highly variable.
    *   **Aldicarb/Carbofuran:** Extremely toxic.
    *   **Carbaryl/Propoxur:** Moderately toxic.
*   **Fatal Period:** Death can occur quickly (minutes to hours) from respiratory failure but is less common than with OPs due to rapid enzyme regeneration.

#### **5. Diagnosis**
*   **Cholinesterase Levels:** Depression of plasma/RBC cholinesterase occurs but levels return to normal quickly (often within hours/days) due to spontaneous regeneration.
*   **Urine Analysis:** Detection of specific phenolic metabolites (e.g., **alpha-naphthol** in Carbaryl poisoning, **isopropoxyphenol** in Propoxur poisoning).

#### **6. Treatment**
*   **Decontamination:** Remove contaminated clothing, wash skin with soap and water. Gastric lavage if ingested.
*   **Antidote:**
    *   **[[Atropine]]:** The mainstay of treatment to counteract muscarinic effects (bronchorrhea, bradycardia). Dosing is titrated to the clearing of bronchial secretions.
*   **Contraindication/Controversy:**
    *   **[[Oximes]] (e.g., Pralidoxime/2-PAM):** Generally **not recommended** and often **contraindicated**, particularly in **Carbaryl** poisoning, as they can form a complex that is more toxic than the pesticide itself.
    *   *Exception:* Oximes may be useful adjuncts in **Aldicarb** poisoning.

### **Organochlorines**

Organochlorines are chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides. They are highly persistent in the environment and accumulate in adipose tissue. While largely banned or restricted (like DDT), they are still encountered in forensic practice.

#### **1. Classification and Examples**
| Group | Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Chlorobenzene derivatives** | **DDT** (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) |
| **Indane derivatives** | **Lindane** (Gamma-BHC/Benzene Hexachloride), Gammexane |
| **Cyclodienes** | **Endrin** (Plant Penicillin), **Aldrin**, **Dieldrin**, **Endosulfan** (Thiodan) |
| **Polychloroterpenes** | Toxaphene |

#### **2. Mechanism of Action**
*   They are powerful **CNS Stimulants**.
*   **DDT type:** Interferes with the transport of sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) ions across axonal membranes (stabilizes Na+ channels in the open state), leading to repetitive neuronal discharge.
*   **Cyclodienes (Endrin/Endosulfan) & Lindane:** Primarily act by **antagonizing GABA receptors** (inhibitory neurotransmitter), leading to unchecked excitation and convulsions.
*   **Sensitization:** They sensitize the myocardium to catecholamines, predisposing to cardiac arrhythmias.

#### **3. Clinical Features**
Symptoms usually appear within a few hours of ingestion or skin absorption.
*   **CNS Stimulation (Hallmark):**
    *   Hyperexcitability, agitation, anxiety, confusion.
    *   **Tremors:** Prominent in DDT poisoning.
    *   **Convulsions:** Severe, tonic-clonic seizures are characteristic of Endrin, Dieldrin, and Endosulfan.
*   **Constitutional:** Nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness.
*   **Pupils:** Usually **Dilated** (Mydriasis).
*   **Hyperpyrexia:** May occur due to intense muscle activity.
*   **Chronic Toxicity:** Hepatotoxicity, dermatitis, aplastic anemia (Lindane), peripheral neuropathy.

#### **4. Fatal Dose**
*   **Endrin:** ~ 5–6 g (Very toxic).
*   **DDT:** ~ 15–30 g.
*   **Endosulfan:** ~ 5–10 g.

#### **5. Treatment**
There is **no specific antidote**. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
*   **Decontamination:**
    *   Skin wash with soap and water (avoid oil-based lotions).
    *   Gastric lavage.
    *   **Activated Charcoal:** To adsorb the toxin.
*   **Avoid Oils/Fats:** Do **NOT** give milk, oil, or fatty meals as they enhance the absorption of lipophilic organochlorines.
*   **Seizure Control:** **Benzodiazepines** (Diazepam/Lorazepam) or **Phenobarbitone**.
*   **Avoid Adrenaline:** Epinephrine and other sympathomimetics are contraindicated due to the risk of precipitating **ventricular fibrillation** (myocardial sensitization).
*   **Calcium Gluconate:** IV administration may be helpful (as suggested by some sources for hypocalcemia associated with these poisons).

#### **6. Autopsy Findings**
*   **Odor:** Chemical/Kerosene-like odor (due to solvent).
*   **Respiratory:** Signs of asphyxia, pulmonary edema, froth at mouth/nose.
*   **GI Tract:** Congestion, inflammation, occasional necrosis.
*   **Organs:** Liver and kidneys may show degeneration/necrosis (centrilobular necrosis in liver).
*   **Endrin Specific:** White frothy fluid from mouth/nostrils is often prominent.

#### **7. Medicolegal Aspects**
*   **Endrin:** Historically termed "**Plant Penicillin**" due to its wide use. It was a common agent for suicide and homicide (white emulsion, easily mixed with milk/alcohol) before being banned/restricted.
*   **Endosulfan:** Aerial spraying scandals (e.g., Cashew plantations in Kerala) linked to congenital anomalies and health issues lead to its ban.
*   **Persistence:** Detected in exhumed bodies due to resistance to decomposition.
