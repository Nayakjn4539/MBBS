# [[Esophagus]] > Deglutition

# Deglutition (Swallowing)

[[Deglutition]] is the physiological process of the propulsion of a food bolus from the oral cavity to the stomach. It is a complex neuromuscular activity involving the coordination of multiple muscles and cranial nerves.

**General Overview:**
*   **Duration:** The entire process takes approximately 8–20 seconds to reach the stomach, though the pharyngeal phase is extremely rapid (< 1 second).
*   **Control:** It involves both voluntary and involuntary (reflexive) components.
*   **Phases:** It is divided into three distinct phases:
    1.  Oral Phase (Voluntary)
    2.  Pharyngeal Phase (Involuntary)
    3.  Esophageal Phase (Involuntary)

### 1. Oral Phase (Buccal Phase)
This is the only **voluntary** phase of swallowing. It prepares the food for transport.

*   **Preparation:** Solids are masticated (chewed) and mixed with saliva to form a cohesive bolus. Liquids are held as a bolus.
*   **Propulsion:**
    *   The lips are closed by the [[orbicularis oris]] (preventing anterior spillage).
    *   The tongue elevates and presses against the hard palate.
    *   An anterior-to-posterior rolling movement of the tongue propels the bolus backward toward the oropharynx.
    *   The phase ends when the bolus passes the [[anterior tonsillar pillar]] (palatoglossal arch), triggering the swallowing reflex.

**Cranial Nerves Involved:**
*   **CN V (Trigeminal):** Mastication.
*   **CN VII (Facial):** Lip closure (orbicularis oris), taste (anterior 2/3 tongue).
*   **CN XII (Hypoglossal):** Tongue movements.

### 2. Pharyngeal Phase
This is an **involuntary reflex** triggered by the contact of the bolus with receptors on the tongue, palatoglossal arches, and posterior pharyngeal wall. It is the most complex phase and lasts less than 1 second.

**Key Physiological Events (The "Protective" Mechanisms):**

1.  **Nasopharyngeal Closure:**
    *   The [[soft palate]] tenses and elevates to contact the posterior pharyngeal wall.
    *   **[[Passavant's Ridge]]:** A mucosal ridge on the posterior pharyngeal wall (formed by palatopharyngeus and superior constrictor fibers) contracts to meet the soft palate, preventing nasal regurgitation.
2.  **Oropharyngeal Closure:**
    *   The tongue base retracts and elevates against the palate to prevent the bolus from re-entering the mouth.
3.  **Laryngeal Protection (Airway Closure):**
    *   Respiration ceases temporarily (swallowing apnea).
    *   The larynx and hyoid bone elevate (move up and forward) under the base of the tongue.
    *   **Three-tier closure:**
        *   Adduction of [[true vocal cords]].
        *   Adduction of [[false vocal cords]].
        *   Approximation of aryepiglottic folds and epiglottis.
    *   The epiglottis deflects backward over the laryngeal inlet, directing the bolus into the [[pyriform fossa]].
4.  **Pharyngeal Peristalsis:**
    *   Sequential contraction of superior, middle, and inferior pharyngeal constrictors propels the bolus downward.
5.  **Cricopharyngeal Relaxation:**
    *   The [[Upper Esophageal Sphincter]] (UES), formed by the cricopharyngeus muscle, relaxes to allow the bolus into the esophagus. This relaxation must be synchronous with pharyngeal contraction.

**Cranial Nerves Involved:**
*   **Afferent (Sensory):** CN IX (Glossopharyngeal), CN X (Vagus).
*   **Efferent (Motor):** [[Pharyngeal plexus]] (CN IX, X).

### 3. Esophageal Phase
This is an **involuntary** phase that transports the bolus from the UES to the stomach. It takes 8–20 seconds.

**Mechanism:**
*   **Primary Peristalsis:**
    *   A continuation of the peristaltic wave initiated in the pharynx.
    *   It sweeps the bolus down the entire length of the esophagus.
    *   **Anatomical Correlation:** The upper 1/3 of the esophagus contains striated muscle (rapid contraction), while the lower 1/3 is smooth muscle (slower contraction). The middle 1/3 is mixed.
*   **Secondary Peristalsis:**
    *   Initiated by distension of the esophagus (e.g., if a bolus gets stuck or food remains).
    *   It occurs independently of swallowing and continues until the esophagus is empty.
*   **LES Relaxation:**
    *   The [[Lower Esophageal Sphincter]] (LES) relaxes well before the peristaltic wave arrives to allow food entry into the stomach.
    *   The LES then closes to prevent **[[Gastroesophageal Reflux]]**.

### Neural Regulation
*   **Swallowing Center:** Located in the medulla (brainstem). It integrates sensory input and coordinates motor output.
*   **Afferent Input:** Receptors in the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx via CN V, IX, and X.
*   **Efferent Output:** Nucleus Ambiguus and Dorsal Motor Nucleus of Vagus via CN V, VII, IX, X, and XII.

**Mnemonic for Swallowing Phases:**

*   **O**ral (Voluntary)
*   **P**haryngeal (Involuntary, Airway protection)
*   **E**sophageal (Involuntary, Peristalsis)

### Clinical Implications

| Condition | Defect | Clinical Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Dysphagia]]** | Difficulty in swallowing due to structural or neuromuscular pathology. | Sensation of food sticking, coughing while eating. |
| **Nasal Regurgitation** | Failure of the soft palate to close the nasopharynx. | Fluids coming out of the nose; seen in cleft palate or palatal palsy. |
| **Aspiration** | Failure of laryngeal protection (vocal cord palsy or anesthesia of larynx). | Coughing, choking, [[aspiration pneumonia]]. |
| **[[Zenker's Diverticulum]]** | Incoordination between pharyngeal contraction and cricopharyngeal relaxation (Killian's Dehiscence). | Dysphagia, regurgitation of undigested food, halitosis. |
| **[[Achalasia]]** | Failure of LES relaxation and absence of peristalsis. | Dysphagia to both solids and liquids, regurgitation. |
| **[[Dysphagia Lusoria]]** | Compression of the esophagus by an aberrant right subclavian artery. | Dysphagia due to vascular compression. |
| **Odynophagia** | Painful swallowing. | Indicates inflammation (e.g., tonsillitis, esophagitis). |
