# [[Episcleritis]]

### Definition
**Episcleritis** is a benign, recurrent, self-limiting inflammation of the [[episclera]] (the deep subconjunctival connective tissue) involving the overlying [[Tenon's capsule]] but not the underlying [[sclera]].
*   **Demographics:** It typically affects young adults, being twice as common in females than males.
*   **Nature:** Usually transient, lasting days to weeks, with a strong tendency to recur.

### Anatomy Relevance
The [[episclera]] is a thin, dense, vascularized layer of connective tissue covering the sclera proper.
*   **Vascular Supply:** It contains two vascular plexuses:
    1.  **Superficial Episcleral Plexus:** Inflamed in **Episcleritis**. These vessels are arranged radially.
    2.  **Deep Scleral Plexus:** Inflamed in [[Scleritis]].
*   **Histology:** Localized lymphocytic infiltration of episcleral tissue associated with edema and congestion of overlying Tenon's capsule and [[conjunctiva]].

### Etiology
In the majority of cases, the cause is **idiopathic**. However, about one-third of cases are associated with systemic conditions.

**1. Idiopathic (Most Common)**
**2. Systemic Inflammatory/Connective Tissue Diseases:**
*   [[Rheumatoid arthritis]] (Most common systemic association).
*   [[Systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE).
*   [[Polyarteritis nodosa]] (PAN).
*   [[Wegener's granulomatosis]].
*   Relapsing polychondritis.
*   [[Gout]].
**3. Infectious Causes:**
*   [[Herpes zoster]] virus (Herpes zoster ophthalmicus).
*   [[Syphilis]].
*   [[Lyme disease]].
*   [[Tuberculosis]].
**4. Hypersensitivity Reactions:** To endogenous toxins (e.g., tubercular or streptococcal toxins).
**5. Dermatological Associations:** [[Rosacea]], [[Psoriasis]].

### Classification and Clinical Types
Episcleritis is clinically divided into two types based on presentation:

| Feature | **Simple (Diffuse) Episcleritis** | **Nodular Episcleritis** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frequency** | More common (75% of cases). | Less common. |
| **Appearance** | Sectoral or diffuse redness. | Circumscribed, pink/purple flat nodule. |
| **Location** | Usually temporal aspect. | Usually 2–3 mm away from the [[limbus]]. |
| **Mobility** | N/A | The nodule is firm, tender, and **can be moved separately from the sclera**. |
| **Course** | Peaks in 12–24 hours, resolves in 1–3 weeks. | More prolonged course; takes longer to resolve. |

### Clinical Features

#### Symptoms
*   **Onset:** Sudden acute onset.
*   **Redness:** Usually unilateral, sectoral, or diffuse.
*   **Discomfort:** Mild sensation of heat, prickling, grittiness, or foreign body sensation.
*   **Pain:** Usually **painless** or mild discomfort. *Note: Severe pain suggests scleritis*.
*   **Watering:** Mild lacrimation may be present.
*   **Photophobia:** Mild or absent.

#### Signs
1.  **Hyperemia:** Bright red or salmon-pink hue (unlike the bluish-red hue of scleritis).
2.  **Vascular Pattern:** Large episcleral vessels run in a radial direction beneath the conjunctiva.
3.  **Tenderness:** Mild tenderness on touch over the inflamed area.
4.  **Episcleritis Periodica Fugax:** A rare fleeting type with frequent, transient attacks lasting hours to days.

### Diagnostic Test: Phenylephrine Blanching Test
This is the critical test to differentiate Episcleritis from Scleritis.
*   **Procedure:** Instill **10% or 2.5% [[Phenylephrine]]** drops.
*   **Result in Episcleritis:** The superficial episcleral vessels constrict, leading to **blanching** of the redness.
*   **Result in Scleritis:** The deep vascular plexus does not constrict significantly; redness **persists**.

### Differential Diagnosis

| Feature | **Episcleritis** | **Scleritis** | **Conjunctivitis** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vessels Involved** | Superficial episcleral plexus | Deep vascular plexus | Conjunctival vessels |
| **Color/Hue** | Bright Red / Salmon Pink | Bluish / Violaceous / Purple | Bright Red |
| **Pain** | Mild / Discomfort | **Severe, boring, deep pain** | Gritty / Foreign body sensation |
| **Tenderness** | Mild | Marked / Severe | Absent |
| **Discharge** | Watery / None | Watery | Mucopurulent / Purulent |
| **Mobility** | Conjunctiva moves over nodule | Nodule is fixed to sclera | Conjunctiva moves with vessels |
| **Phenylephrine Test** | **Blanches** | **Does not blanch** | Blanches |
| **Visual Acuity** | Normal | May be affected | Normal |

Other Differentials:
*   **Inflamed [[Pinguecula]]:** Usually horizontal (3 or 9 o'clock), yellow-white deposit.
*   **Phlyctenular Conjunctivitis:** Review history for TB or Staph allergy; nodule usually at limbus.
*   **Foreign Body:** Lodged in bulbar conjunctiva.

### Complications
Complications are rare in episcleritis. It generally does not involve the cornea or uvea.
*   Occasionally, **transient uveitis** may occur.
*   Rarely extends into deeper tissues to become scleritis.

---

### Management
The condition is often self-limiting, but treatment helps relieve symptoms and hasten resolution.

**1. Mild Cases:**
*   **Observation:** Often requires no treatment.
*   **Supportive:** [[Artificial tears]] (0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose) for soothing effect.
*   **Cold Compresses:** Applied to closed lids for symptomatic relief.

**2. Moderate / Symptomatic Cases:**
*   **Topical NSAIDs:** E.g., [[Ketorolac]] 0.3%.
*   **Topical Corticosteroids:** Mild steroids like [[Fluorometholone]] or [[Loteprednol]] instilled 2–3 hourly for a few days. *Note: Monitor IOP if used.*

**3. Severe / Recurrent Cases:**
*   **Systemic NSAIDs:** Oral [[Flurbiprofen]] (300 mg OD) or [[Indomethacin]] (25 mg TDS) or [[Ibuprofen]] (400 mg TDS) are highly effective,.
*   **Systemic Evaluation:** Investigation for underlying systemic diseases (RA, Gout, SLE) is warranted in recurrent cases.
