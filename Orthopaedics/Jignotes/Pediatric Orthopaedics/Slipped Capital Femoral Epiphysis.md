# Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE)

### Definition and Overview
[[Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis]] (SCFE), also known as **adolescent coxa vara** or **epiphysiolisthesis**, is a disorder of the adolescent hip where the [[proximal femoral epiphysis]] (head of the femur) displaces relative to the [[femoral neck]] through the [[physis]] (growth plate).

*   **Misnomer:** The term is technically a misnomer. The [[femoral head]] remains held in the [[acetabulum]] by the [[ligamentum teres]], while the [[femoral neck]] displaces **anteriorly and superiorly**. This makes the epiphysis appear displaced **posteriorly and inferiorly**.
*   **Demographics:** Most common in adolescents (10–16 years) during the rapid growth spurt. Boys are affected more than girls.
*   **Body Habitus:** Classically seen in two body types:
    1.  **Obese children** (mechanical overload).
    2.  **Tall, thin, rapidly growing children**.

### Etiopathogenesis
The exact cause is multifactorial, involving a combination of mechanical and hormonal factors.
*   **Pathological Site:** The slip occurs through the **zone of hypertrophic cartilage** within the [[physis]].
*   **Mechanical Factors:** Obesity increases shear stress across the physis. Increased femoral retroversion or a more vertical physis increases susceptibility.
*   **Hormonal Factors:** Imbalance between growth hormone (promotes proliferation) and sex hormones (promote fusion). Hypogonadism, hypothyroidism, and renal osteodystrophy are risk factors.

### Classification
SCFE is classified based on stability, duration, and radiological severity.

**1. Loder’s Classification (Stability)**
*   **Stable SCFE:** The patient is able to walk (with or without crutches). Risk of [[avascular necrosis]] (AVN) is low.
*   **Unstable SCFE:** The patient is unable to bear weight (even with crutches). Prognosis is poorer with a high risk of AVN.

**2. Temporal Classification**
*   **Acute:** Symptoms < 3 weeks.
*   **Chronic:** Symptoms > 3 weeks (Most common).
*   **Acute-on-Chronic:** Sudden exacerbation of pain in a patient with a long history of mild symptoms.

**3. Radiological Grading (Southwick Angle)**
*   **Mild:** < 30° slip.
*   **Moderate:** 30°–50° slip.
*   **Severe:** > 50° slip.

### Clinical Features
The onset is usually insidious.
*   **Pain:** Usually in the groin or hip, but frequently referred to the **anteromedial thigh or knee** via the [[obturator nerve]].
    *   *Clinical Implication:* Any adolescent presenting with isolated knee pain must have their hips examined to rule out SCFE.
*   **Limp:** Antalgic or [[Trendelenburg gait]].
*   **Attitude of Limb:** The affected limb lies in **external rotation** and may be shortened.
*   **Range of Motion:** Restriction of **abduction** and **internal rotation**.

**Special Physical Signs**
*   **Axis Deviation Sign:** When the hip is flexed passively from an extended position, the thigh inevitably goes into **external rotation** (points towards the ipsilateral shoulder instead of the contralateral shoulder).

### Diagnostic Imaging
Plain X-rays are the primary diagnostic tool. **AP** and **Frog-leg lateral views** are essential. The lateral view is more sensitive for detecting early slips.

#### Radiological Signs
| Sign | Description | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trethowan's Sign** (Klein's Line) | A line drawn along the superior border of the [[femoral neck]] on an AP view. | **Normal:** Line cuts through a portion of the [[femoral epiphysis]]. <br> **SCFE:** Line passes **superior** to the epiphysis (does not intersect it). |
| **Capener's Sign** | Loss of the dense triangular appearance of the inferomedial metaphysis. | Indicates early overlap of neck and head. |
| **Blanch Sign of Steel** | Crescent-shaped density in the proximal femoral neck. | Due to the superimposition of the posteriorly displaced epiphysis on the metaphysis. |
| **Pistol Grip Deformity** | Deformity of the proximal femur seen in chronic/healed cases. | Can lead to [[femoroacetabular impingement]] later in life. |

### Treatment
The goal is to prevent further slippage and minimize complications.

**1. Principles**
*   **Stop the Slip:** Immediate stabilization is required.
*   **Avoid Reduction:** Forcible reduction of chronic slips is contraindicated as it damages the posterior retinacular vessels, leading to [[avascular necrosis]].
*   **Prophylactic Fixation:** The contralateral hip is often pinned prophylactically because bilateral involvement occurs in up to **1/3 to 40%** of cases.

**2. Surgical Management**
*   **In Situ Pinning:** The gold standard for stable slips. A single cannulated cancellous screw is passed through the center of the neck into the epiphysis.
*   **Open Reduction:** Reserved for unstable, severe slips, but carries a high risk of AVN.
*   **Corrective Osteotomy:** Performed for severe deformities (e.g., Southwick osteotomy) usually at the subtrochanteric or intertrochanteric level to restore biomechanics.

### Complications
1.  **Avascular Necrosis (AVN):** The most serious complication. Occurs due to disruption of the [[retinacular blood supply]]. Higher risk in unstable slips or forceful manipulation.
2.  **Chondrolysis:** Acute cartilage necrosis of the femoral head and acetabulum, leading to a stiff, painful hip. Often associated with pin penetration into the joint.
3.  **Coxa Vara:** If the slip is untreated or fixation fails, the neck heals in varus.
4.  **Femoroacetabular Impingement (FAI):** Residual deformity of the femoral head-neck junction can cause cam-type impingement and early [[osteoarthritis]].

### Mnemonics
*   **SCFE** patients are often **Skiffy** (slang for heavy/obese) or **Stretchy** (tall/thin).
*   **KLEIN'S Line:** **K**icks the **L**ip of **E**piphysis **I**n **N**ormal **S**tates. (If it misses, it's SCFE).
