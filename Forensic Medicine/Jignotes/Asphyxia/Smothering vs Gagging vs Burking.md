# [[Asphyxia]] > Smothering vs Gagging vs Burking

### Comparison: Smothering vs Gagging vs Burking

These three conditions fall under the broad category of [[Mechanical Asphyxia]]. While they share the common endpoint of oxygen deprivation, the mechanism of occlusion and the medicolegal implications differ significantly.

### Quick Comparison Table

| Feature | [[Smothering]] | [[Gagging]] | [[Burking]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | Mechanical occlusion of external respiratory orifices (Nose & Mouth). | Mechanical occlusion of the air passages from within by a foreign object. | A combination of Homicidal Smothering and [[Traumatic Asphyxia]]. |
| **Primary Mechanism** | Anoxic Anoxia (prevention of air entry). | Obstruction of pharynx/larynx + accumulation of secretions. | Fixation of respiratory muscles (Chest compression) + occlusion of airway. |
| **Agent** | Hand, pillow, plastic bag, another body (overlaying). | Cloth, paper, dough, rags stuffed into mouth. | Kneeling/sitting on chest + Hand over mouth/nose. |
| **Manner of Death** | Accidental (infants), Homicidal (adults), Suicidal (plastic bags). | Homicidal (infanticide) or Accidental (during robbery). | Exclusively Homicidal. |

### 1. Smothering

**Definition:** It is a form of asphyxia caused by closing the external respiratory orifices (mouth and nostrils) either by hand or other means, or by blocking the cavities by foreign substances.

**Mechanism:** Deprivation of oxygen by preventing air from entering the respiratory tract.

**Types & Circumstances:**
1.  **Homicidal Smothering:** Usually victim is incapacitated (intoxicated, elderly, infant) or stunned by a blow. Methods include pressing a pillow ("gentle homicide") or using hands.
2.  **Accidental Smothering:**
    *   **[[Overlaying]] (Compression Suffocation):** A sleeping adult (often intoxicated) rolls over an infant/child, occluding their face/chest.
    *   **Plastic Bag Asphyxia:** Children playing with bags or autoerotic practices.
    *   **Bedding:** Epileptics or intoxicated persons burying face in a pillow.
3.  **Suicidal Smothering:** Impossible by hands alone (as hands relax upon unconsciousness). Possible with plastic bags or adhesive tape.

**Autopsy Findings:**
*   **External:**
    *   **Negative Findings:** Often no signs if a soft object like a pillow is used ("The perfect murder").
    *   **Abrasions/Bruises:** If hands are used, crescentic fingernail marks or abrasions may be found around the nose and mouth.
    *   **Pale Area:** Pressure from a pillow may cause pale/white skin around the nose/mouth due to blood being squeezed out of capillaries, contrasting with surrounding [[Cyanosis]].
*   **Internal:**
    *   Classical signs of asphyxia (petechiae, congestion, fluidity of blood).
    *   Evidence of struggle (if victim conscious).

### 2. Gagging

**Definition:** A form of asphyxia resulting from forcing a cloth or foreign object into the mouth, or tying a cloth around the jaw to close the mouth/nose, sufficiently deep to block the pharynx.

**Mechanism:**
*   Direct obstruction of the pharynx/larynx.
*   Accumulation of saliva, mucus, and edema behind the gag worsening the obstruction.
*   Tongue is pushed backward (posterior glossoptosis).

**Medicolegal Aspects:**
*   Almost always **Homicidal**.
*   Commonly seen in **Infanticide** (stuffing cloth/paper into infant's mouth).
*   In adults, often associated with robbery/burglary. The intent is usually to **silence** the victim, not necessarily to kill, but death ensues accidentally due to asphyxia.

**Autopsy Findings:**
*   **The Gag:** The foreign object (cloth, paper, rags) is usually found in situ. If removed, the mouth may be open.
*   **Injuries:** Bruising or laceration of the lips, gums, tongue, or palate due to forceful insertion.
*   **Elastic bands:** If tied around the head, may leave ligature marks at the corners of the mouth/nape of neck.
*   **Saliva:** Dried saliva stains may be present on the gag or face.

### 3. Burking

**Definition:** It is a specific method of homicide involving a combination of **[[Smothering]]** and **[[Traumatic Asphyxia]]**.

**Historical Context:** Named after **William Burke** and **William Hare**, notorious body snatchers in Edinburgh (1828). They murdered 16 people to sell fresh cadavers to the anatomy department (Dr. Robert Knox) for dissection, as the bodies showed no external marks of violence.

**Method:**
1.  The victim (often intoxicated) is thrown to the ground.
2.  The assailant kneels or sits on the victim's chest (Traumatic Asphyxia - prevents respiratory movements).
3.  Simultaneously, the assailant closes the victim's nose and mouth with one hand and pushes the lower jaw up (Smothering - prevents air entry).

**Autopsy Findings:**
*   **Specific Signs:** Since it combines two methods, signs of both are present.
*   **External:**
    *   Intense [[Cyanosis]] and congestion of the face (more than simple smothering).
    *   [[Petechial Hemorrhages]] in conjunctiva and face.
    *   Bruising on the chest wall (from kneeling) and around the nose/mouth (from hand pressure).
*   **Internal:**
    *   Fracture of ribs or damage to thoracic organs may occur but is rare if soft pressure was applied.
    *   Deep congestion of lungs and internal organs.

### Key Differentiators for Exams

*   **If the chest is compressed + mouth closed:** It is **[[Burking]]**.
*   **If an object is *inside* the mouth:** It is **[[Gagging]]**.
*   **If the mouth/nose are covered from *outside*:** It is **[[Smothering]]**.

### Mnemonic
**B**urke **S**at **T**ight
*   **B**urking = **S**mothering + **T**raumatic asphyxia.
