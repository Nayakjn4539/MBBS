# Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis (AHC)

**Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis** (AHC), also known as **Apollo Conjunctivitis** or **Epidemic Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis**, is a highly contagious viral infection of the [[conjunctiva]] characterized by multiple conjunctival hemorrhages, hyperemia, and mild follicular hyperplasia.

### Etiology
AHC is primarily caused by **RNA viruses** belonging to the **Picornavirus** group.

| Causative Agent | Specific Strains | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Enterovirus** | **Type 70** | Most common cause globally. Associated with the 1969 pandemic in Ghana (coinciding with the Apollo XI moon landing). |
| **Coxsackie virus** | **Type A-24** | Variant A24 (CA24v) is a frequent cause of epidemics. |
| **Adenovirus** | **Type 11** | Less common cause compared to picornaviruses. |
| **Echo virus** | **Type 34** | Rare cause. |

### Epidemiology and Transmission
*   **Contagiousness:** The disease is **highly contagious** and often occurs in explosive epidemics or pandemics.
*   **Transmission:** Direct **hand-to-eye contact** or contact with contaminated fomites (towels, instruments).
*   **Incubation Period:** Very short, typically **1–2 days** (ranges up to 24-48 hours).

### Clinical Features
The disease usually follows a short, self-limiting course of **5–7 days**.

#### Symptoms
*   **Onset:** Sudden.
*   **Pain:** Foreign body sensation to severe pain.
*   **Discharge:** Profuse **watery discharge** (serous).
*   **Visual disturbance:** Transient blurring of vision may occur.
*   **Others:** Redness, mild [[photophobia]], and lid swelling.

#### Signs
1.  **Conjunctival Hyperemia:** Marked congestion and chemosis (edema of the bulbar conjunctiva).
2.  **Subconjunctival Hemorrhages (SCH):**
    *   This is the hallmark sign.
    *   Initially appears as petechial hemorrhages in the [[bulbar conjunctiva]].
    *   These can coalesce to form large diffuse hemorrhages, often starting superiorly and spreading.
3.  **Follicular Reaction:** Mild follicular hyperplasia is typically seen in the palpebral conjunctiva (lower fornix).
4.  **Lid Edema:** Eyelids are often swollen.
5.  **Lymphadenopathy:** Enlargement of the **pre-auricular lymph nodes** is a common finding.

#### Corneal Involvement
*   **Epithelial Keratitis:** Fine [[superficial punctate keratitis]] (SPK) may occur.
*   Corneal involvement is generally mild compared to [[epidemic keratoconjunctivitis]] (EKC).

### Diagnosis
Diagnosis is primarily **clinical**, based on the rapid onset, epidemic nature, and characteristic presence of hemorrhages.

*   **Differentiation from bacterial conjunctivitis:** AHC presents with watery discharge and follicles, whereas bacterial infections typically present with mucopurulent/purulent discharge and papillae.
*   **Differentiation from Adenoviral EKC:** AHC has a shorter incubation period (1-2 days vs. 8 days for EKC) and prominent hemorrhages.

### Management
There is no specific antiviral treatment effective for AHC. Management is supportive and focused on preventing spread.

1.  **Prophylaxis (Crucial):**
    *   **Isolation:** Relative isolation of the infected individual.
    *   **Hygiene:** Frequent handwashing is essential.
    *   **Avoid Fomites:** Do not share towels, handkerchiefs, or pillows.
    *   **Disinfection:** Proper sterilization of ophthalmic instruments (e.g., tonometers) to prevent cross-infection.

2.  **Supportive Treatment:**
    *   **Cold Compresses:** To relieve discomfort and lid edema.
    *   **Sunglasses:** To reduce photophobia and glare.
    *   **Lubricants:** Artificial tears to soothe ocular irritation.

3.  **Medical Therapy:**
    *   **Antibiotics:** Broad-spectrum antibiotic eye drops may be prescribed solely to prevent **secondary bacterial infection**.
    *   **Steroids:** generally **avoided** unless there are severe subepithelial infiltrates (rare in AHC compared to EKC).

**Clinical Implication:**
Because the incubation period is very short (1–2 days) and the virus is highly contagious, outbreaks spread rapidly within families and communities. Patients must be educated that the condition is **self-limiting** and resolves within **7 days** without sequelae in the vast majority of cases.

### Mnemonic
**"Apollo 11 landed fast"**
*   **Apollo:** Apollo conjunctivitis.
*   **11:** Adenovirus type **11** (one of the causes).
*   **Landed:** **L**mphadenopathy (pre-auricular).
*   **Fast:** Very short incubation (1-2 days) and rapid spread.
