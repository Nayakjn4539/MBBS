# Defense Wounds

[[Defense wounds]] are injuries sustained by a victim during an immediate and instinctive reaction to protect themselves from an assault. Their presence is of paramount importance in forensic traumatology as they serve as objective evidence of the victim's consciousness and resistance during the attack.

### Classification of Defense Wounds

Defense injuries are broadly classified based on the mechanism of reaction:

**1. Active Defense Wounds**
*   **Mechanism:** Occur when the victim tries to **grasp** the weapon to prevent it from injuring vital areas.
*   **Common Sites:** Palms of the hands and flexor aspects of the fingers.
*   **Appearance:**
    *   **Sharp Weapon (Knife):** Irregular, deep [[incised wounds]] or cuts on the palms and the bends of fingers. The web space between the thumb and index finger is frequently involved.
    *   **Blunt Weapon:** Abrasions or contusions on the palms (rare, as grasping a blunt object is less damaging than a sharp one).

**2. Passive Defense Wounds**
*   **Mechanism:** Occur when the victim raises their hands or arms to **shield** the head or face, or curls up to protect the abdomen/chest.
*   **Common Sites:**
    *   **Upper Limbs:** Posterior (extensor) aspect of the forearm, ulnar border of the forearm, dorsum of the hands and knuckles.
    *   **Lower Limbs:** Anterior aspect of shins/legs (if the victim is lying down and kicking at the assailant).
*   **Appearance:**
    *   **Blunt Force:** [[Contusions]], abrasions, and fractures. A classic example is the **"Nightstick Fracture"** (isolated fracture of the ulnar shaft) caused by raising the forearm to block a blow from a stick or rod.
    *   **Sharp Force:** Incised or [[chop wounds]] on the ulnar border of the forearm or outer aspect of the arms.

### Medicolegal Aspects of Defense Wounds
1.  **Proof of Homicide:** Their presence strongly indicates [[homicide]]. They are absent in suicide and accidents.
2.  **Consciousness:** Indicates the victim was conscious, alert, and capable of reacting to the threat.
3.  **Resistance:** Proves that a struggle took place between the victim and the assailant.
4.  **Absence:** Defense wounds may be absent if the victim was:
    *   Taken by surprise (attacked from behind).
    *   Unconscious, sleeping, or intoxicated ([[Alcohol]]/drugs).
    *   Overpowered quickly or incapacitated by the first blow.

# Fabricated Wounds

[[Fabricated wounds]] (also known as Fictitious, Forged, or Invented wounds) are injuries produced by a person on their own body, or inflicted by another person with their consent (Self-suffered), usually to support a false charge against an enemy.

### Motives for Fabrication
*   To charge an enemy with assault (simple or [[grievous hurt]]).
*   To convert a simple injury into a grievous one to aggravate the charge.
*   To create a defense of "self-defense" after committing a crime.
*   To avert suspicion from oneself.
*   To obtain compensation or sick leave.

### Characteristics of Fabricated Wounds

The diagnosis of a fabricated wound is based on inconsistency with the alleged history and specific morphological features.

| Feature | Characteristics of Fabricated Wounds |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Severity** | Usually **superficial**. Only skin deep (rarely muscle deep). Fatal injuries are never inflicted. |
| **Site** | **Accessible parts** of the body (e.g., outer aspect of arms, thighs, front of chest, forehead). |
| **Sparing** | **Vital organs** (eyes, neck, abdomen) and sensitive areas (lips, nipples, genitals) are carefully avoided. |
| **Direction** | usually directed **towards** the central line of the body or from above downwards (if right-handed). |
| **Pattern** | Often **multiple**, parallel, and grouped together. They may look uniform in size and shape. |
| **Clothing** | Usually **intact**. The person lifts the clothes to inflict the wound (in contrast to genuine assaults where clothes are cut/torn). |
| **Tailing** | In incised wounds, the **tailing** is often at the lower end, consistent with self-infliction by the dominant hand. |
| **Hesitation** | **Hesitation cuts** (tentative superficial cuts) are usually **absent** (unlike in suicide), but the wounds themselves are often tentative. |

### Types of Fabricated Wounds
1.  **Incised Wounds:** Most common. Made by blades, razors, or glass.
2.  **Contusions:** Self-inflicted by hammers or stones (less common due to pain).
3.  **Lacerations:** Rare, as they require significant blunt force.
4.  **Burns:** Superficial burns may be self-inflicted to claim torture.
5.  **Gunshot:** Rare, usually on non-vital limbs (left arm/leg for right-handed persons) to simulate an attack.

### Detection and Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Incompatibility:** The injuries often do not match the story (e.g., a "violent struggle" alleged, but only superficial parallel cuts found).
*   **Absence of Defense Wounds:** A person claiming a violent attack usually lacks genuine defense wounds.
*   **Stains:** Blood stains on the clothes may not correspond to the position of the wound (since clothes were lifted).
*   **Legal Consequence:** Fabricating injuries to file a false case is punishable under **Section 192, 193 [[IPC]]** (Fabricating false evidence) and **Section 211 IPC** (False charge of offense made with intent to injure).

### Mnemonic for Fabricated Wounds: "S-C-A-M"

*   **S** - **S**uperficial (mostly)
*   **C** - **C**lothing intact (lifted up)
*   **A** - **A**ccessible sites only
*   **M** - **M**ultiple and Parallel

### Differentiation: Defense vs. Fabricated vs. Suicidal

| Feature | Defense Wounds | Fabricated Wounds | Suicidal Wounds |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Intent** | Protection/Survival | Deception/False Charge | Self-destruction |
| **Site** | Palms, ulnar forearm, shins | Accessible, non-vital areas (outer arms, thighs) | Elective sites (Throat, wrists, precordium) |
| **Severity** | Variable (can be deep) | Superficial | Usually fatal/deep |
| **Hesitation Cuts**| Absent | Absent | **Present** (pathognomonic) |
| **Clothing** | Often damaged | Usually **spared/lifted** | Removed/opened to expose site |
| **Medical Type** | Homicidal | Self-inflicted (Legal) | Self-inflicted (Fatal) |
