# [[Asphyxia]] > examination of blooood in case of drowning

### Examination of Blood in Drowning

The examination of blood in drowning cases focuses on biochemical changes resulting from the aspiration of fluid (fresh water or salt water) into the lungs and its subsequent movement into or out of the pulmonary circulation.

#### 1. Biochemical Changes in Blood
The changes in blood composition depend heavily on the tonicity of the drowning medium compared to blood plasma.

**A. Fresh Water Drowning (Hemodilution)**
Fresh water is **hypotonic** to blood. When inhaled into the alveoli, it rapidly crosses the alveolar-capillary membrane into the circulation.
*   **Mechanism:** Massive absorption of water into the blood leads to **hemodilution**.
*   **Volume:** Blood volume increases (Hypervolemia).
*   **Electrolytes:**
    *   **Sodium (Na+) & Chloride (Cl-):** Decrease (diluted).
    *   **Calcium (Ca++):** Decreases.
    *   **Potassium (K+):** **Increases**. (Hypotonic water causes red blood cell swelling and rupture/hemolysis, releasing intracellular potassium).
*   **Haemoglobin:** Increases (crenated RBCs/Hemolysis).

**B. Salt Water Drowning (Hemoconcentration)**
Sea water is **hypertonic** to blood.
*   **Mechanism:** The hypertonic fluid in the lungs draws water *out* of the blood circulation into the alveoli (pulmonary edema) while electrolytes from the sea water diffuse *into* the blood.
*   **Volume:** Blood volume decreases (Hypovolemia).
*   **Electrolytes:**
    *   **Sodium (Na+) & Chloride (Cl-):** Increase significantly.
    *   **Magnesium (Mg++) & Strontium:** Increase.
    *   **Calcium:** Increases.
*   **Haemoglobin:** Increases (Hemoconcentration).,

#### 2. Specific Chemical Tests
These tests compare the blood composition between the right and left sides of the heart.

**A. [[Gettler's Test]] (Chloride Test)**
This test compares the chloride content of blood from the right and left chambers of the heart.
*   **Principle:** Blood in the left heart returns directly from the lungs (where drowning fluid interaction occurs), whereas blood in the right heart represents systemic venous return.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   **Normal:** Left heart Cl⁻ $\approx$ Right heart Cl⁻.
    *   **Fresh Water Drowning:** Left heart Cl⁻ **<** Right heart Cl⁻ (due to hemodilution). A difference of **>25%** is considered significant.
    *   **Salt Water Drowning:** Left heart Cl⁻ **>** Right heart Cl⁻ (due to hemoconcentration and salt diffusion).
*   **Limitations:** This test is of little value if:
    *   The patent has a [[Patent Foramen Ovale]].
    *   There is putrefaction (decomposition alters electrolyte balance).
    *   It is a case of **dry drowning** or **hydrocution** (no fluid aspiration).,,

**B. Specific Gravity Test**
Similar to the chloride test, this compares the specific gravity of plasma/serum.
*   **Fresh Water:** Specific gravity of Left Atrium blood **<** Right Atrium blood.
*   **Salt Water:** Specific gravity of Left Atrium blood **>** Right Atrium blood.

**C. Magnesium and Strontium Test**
*   Sea water has high concentrations of magnesium and strontium.
*   **Finding:** Elevated levels of **Magnesium** and **Strontium** in the left ventricle blood compared to the right ventricle suggest **salt water drowning**.,

| Feature | Fresh Water Drowning | Salt Water Drowning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Blood Volume** | Hypervolemia (Increases) | Hypovolemia (Decreases) |
| **Hemodynamics** | [[Hemodilution]] | [[Hemoconcentration]] |
| **Chloride (Left Heart)** | Decreased (< Right Heart) | Increased (> Right Heart) |
| **Potassium** | Increased (Hemolysis) | Increased (minor) |
| **Magnesium/Strontium** | Normal | Increased |
| **RBC Morphology** | Swelling and Lysis | Crenated/Shrunken |

#### 3. Toxicological Examination
Blood analysis is crucial to rule out incapacitation due to drugs or alcohol, which often contributes to drowning.
*   **Sample Collection:** Blood should be collected from peripheral veins (femoral or iliac) to avoid contamination.
*   **Preservative:** Sodium Fluoride (for alcohol) and Potassium Oxalate.
*   **Analysis:** For alcohol, narcotics, sedatives, or carbon monoxide (swimmers in fires).,,

#### 4. Diatom Test (Circulatory Aspect)
While diatoms are essentially looked for in bone marrow or solid organs, their presence relies on intact circulation.
*   **Mechanism:** During drowning, microscopic algae ([[Diatoms]]) enter the lungs, penetrate the alveolar walls, enter the pulmonary veins, pass to the **left heart**, and are pumped via the systemic circulation to distant organs (brain, liver, bone marrow).
*   **Significance:** Presence of diatoms in systemic circulation/organs indicates the victim was **alive** and had an active circulation when they entered the water (Antemortem Drowning).,

#### 5. General Autopsy Findings Regarding Blood
*   **Color:** In fresh water drowning, blood is often diluted; in CO poisoning (if associated), it may be cherry red; generally, in asphyxia, it is dark and fluid. However, descriptions of "abnormal fluidity" are often considered forensic mythology, as postmortem clotting/lysis varies.
*   **Froth:** Fine, white, lathery froth found in airways is a mixture of air, mucus, and water churned by respiratory efforts; it may be blood-stained due to the rupture of small vessels.,,

### Mnemonics
*   **Fresh gets Fat:** Fresh water makes cells swell (hemolysis) and increases blood volume (Hypervolemia).
*   **Salt Shakes and Shrinks:** Salt water causes shivers (tremors/seizures from hypernatremia) and shrinks cells (crenation/hemoconcentration).

---
### Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Validity:** Biochemical tests (Gettler's, Specific gravity) are invalid if **putrefaction** has set in because decomposition gases and fluid diffusion alter electrolyte levels naturally.
*   **Survival Period:** If the victim survives the drowning episode for some time (near-drowning) and dies later (secondary drowning), electrolyte imbalances like hyperkalemia (fresh water) or hypernatremia (salt water) may be the mechanism of death due to cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular fibrillation).,
