# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Composition of ORS

### Composition of Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS)

[[Oral Rehydration Therapy]] (ORT) is often hailed as the most important medical advance of the 20th century. The current standard recommended by the WHO and UNICEF is the **New Reduced Osmolarity ORS**, which replaced the older standard formula to reduce the risk of hypernatremia and decrease stool output.

#### 1. Components and Quantity (Grams/Litre)
To prepare the solution, the following packet contents must be dissolved in **1 Litre** of clean drinking water.

| Ingredient | Quantity (grams) | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sodium Chloride** (NaCl) | **2.6 g** | Replaces lost sodium; essential for transport. |
| **Glucose** (Anhydrous) | **13.5 g** | Facilitates absorption of sodium and water; provides energy. |
| **Potassium Chloride** (KCl) | **1.5 g** | Replaces lost potassium (prevents hypokalemia/paralytic ileus). |
| **Trisodium Citrate** (Dihydrate) | **2.9 g** | Corrects metabolic acidosis; makes the solution **more stable** than bicarbonate. |
| **Total Weight** | **20.5 g** | |

> **Note:** If Glucose is not available, 40g of Sucrose can be used as a substitute, though Glucose is preferred.

#### 2. Molar Concentration (mmol/Litre)
The total osmolarity of the new ORS is **245 mOsm/L**.

| Electrolyte/Substance | Concentration (mmol/L) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Sodium** | **75** |
| **Glucose** | **75** |
| **Chloride** | **65** |
| **Potassium** | **20** |
| **Citrate** | **10** |
| **Total Osmolarity** | **245** |

### Mnemonic: Remember the Numbers!
**"75 Naughty Gluttons ate 65 Chocolates, 20 Potatoes, and 10 Citrus fruits."**

*   **75 Naughty Gluttons**: Sodium (**75**) and Glucose (**75**)
*   **65 Chocolates**: Chloride (**65**)
*   **20 Potatoes**: Potassium (**20**)
*   **10 Citrus fruits**: Citrate (**10**)

### Mechanism of Action
The efficacy of ORS is based on the physiological principle of **[[Coupled Sodium-Glucose Transport]]** in the small intestine.
*   Absorption of sodium is greatly enhanced by the presence of glucose.
*   Water follows sodium passively across the intestinal mucosa, effectively rehydrating the patient even during active diarrhea.

### Important Modifications & Variations

**1. Why "Reduced Osmolarity"?**
The older standard ORS had an osmolarity of 311 mOsm/L (Sodium 90 mmol/L). The **New Reduced Osmolarity ORS (245 mOsm/L)** is preferred because:
*   It reduces stool output by approx 20%.
*   It reduces vomiting by approx 30%.
*   It reduces the need for unscheduled IV therapy by 33%.

**2. Why Citrate instead of Bicarbonate?**
Earlier formulas used Sodium Bicarbonate (2.5g). This was replaced by **[[Trisodium Citrate]]** (2.9g) because:
*   Citrate makes the powder **more stable** (longer shelf life) in hot/humid climates.
*   It reduces stool output more effectively in high-output diarrhea (like Cholera).

**3. ReSoMal (Rehydration Solution for Malnourished)**
For children with **[[Severe Acute Malnutrition]] (SAM)**, standard ORS is dangerous due to high sodium.
*   **ReSoMal** contains **less Sodium** (45 mmol/L) and **more Potassium** (40 mmol/L).

### Clinical Relevance & Administration
*   **Preparation:** Dissolve one full packet in **1 Litre** of potable water. Do *not* boil the solution after mixing.
*   **Shelf Life:** The prepared solution must be used within **24 hours**. Discard any remaining solution after 24 hours to prevent bacterial contamination.
*   **Usage:**
    *   **Plan A (No Dehydration):** Home management to prevent dehydration.
    *   **Plan B (Some Dehydration):** 75 ml/kg of ORS over 4 hours.
    *   **Plan C (Severe Dehydration):** IV fluids are preferred (Ringer's Lactate), but ORS should be started as soon as the patient can drink.
*   **Zinc Supplementation:** Zinc (20mg for >6 months; 10mg for <6 months) should be given for 14 days alongside ORS to reduce severity and duration of the episode.
