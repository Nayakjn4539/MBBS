### Chandler’s Index

**Definition**
Chandler’s index is an epidemiological indicator used to estimate the intensity of **[[Hookworm Infection]]** (Ancylostomiasis) in a community. It is defined as the **average number of hookworm eggs per gram of feces** for the *entire* community (not just the infected persons),.

**Methodology**
*   The egg count is usually determined using the **[[Kato-Katz technique]]**.
*   It serves as a quantitative measure of the worm burden, which is more clinically significant than the mere prevalence rate (percentage of people infected),.

**Interpretation of Chandler’s Index**
The public health significance of the hookworm burden is graded as follows:

| Average Eggs Per Gram (EPG) | Interpretation / Public Health Significance |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Less than 200** | Not significant / No public health problem |
| **200 – 250** | Potential danger |
| **250 – 300** | Minor public health problem |
| **More than 300** | **Major / Important public health problem** |

*[Sources: 138, 1070, 1112]*

**Uses**
1.  **Comparing Worm Loads:** To compare the severity of infection across different population groups or geographical areas.
2.  **Impact Evaluation:** To assess the effectiveness of control measures, particularly after mass treatment (e.g., assessing the reduction in egg output).

**Clinical Relevance**
A high Chandler’s index in a community suggests a high worm load. Since hookworms suck blood, a high index correlates strongly with the prevalence of severe **[[Iron Deficiency Anemia]]** and growth retardation in the population, especially among children and pregnant women.

**Mnemonic**
To remember the cutoff for a major problem:
> **"Chandler Hates 300 Worms"**
*   **Chandler:** Chandler's Index
*   **Hates:** **H**ookworm
*   **300:** The cutoff value (>300) for a **Major** problem.
