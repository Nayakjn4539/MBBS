# **Epidemiology and Prevention of Typhoid Fever**

**[[Typhoid fever]]** (Enteric fever) is a systemic infection caused by *Salmonella typhi*. It is characterized by a continuous fever for 3 to 4 weeks, relative bradycardia, and involvement of lymphoid tissues.

---

### **1. Epidemiological Determinants**

#### **A. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** *[[Salmonella typhi]]*. ( *S. paratyphi* A and B cause Paratyphoid fever, which is generally milder),.
*   **Antigens:** The bacteria has three main antigens:
    1.  **O (Somatic):** Specific for the group.
    2.  **H (Flagellar):** Specific for the type.
    3.  **Vi (Virulence):** Indicates a carrier state or recent immunization.
*   **Resistance:** Killed by pasteurization and chlorination but survives in ice, sewage, and water for weeks,.

#### **B. Reservoir of Infection**
*   **Man is the only known reservoir**.
*   **Cases:** Infectious as long as bacilli appear in stool or urine.
*   **Carriers:** These are more dangerous epidemiologically than cases.
    *   **Convalescent Carriers:** Excrete bacilli for 6–8 weeks after recovery.
    *   **Chronic Carriers:** Excrete bacilli for **>1 year** after clinical attack. The organism usually persists in the **gall bladder** and biliary tract,.
    *   **Clinical Relevance:** *[[Typhoid Mary]]* (Mary Mallon) was a famous chronic carrier (cook) responsible for over 1300 cases.

#### **C. Host Factors**
*   **Age:** Can occur at any age; highest incidence in **5–19 years** age group.
*   **Sex:** More cases in **Males**, but more carriers in **Females**.
*   **Immunity:** Natural infection does not confer 100% immunity; reinfection can occur.

#### **D. Environmental Factors**
*   **Season:** Peak incidence in **July–September** (Rainy season) due to increased fly population and water contamination.
*   **Social:** Associated with poor sanitation, open defecation, and lack of safe drinking water.

### **2. Mode of Transmission**

Transmission is via the **Fecal-Oral** or **Urine-Oral** route.

**Mnemonic: The 5 F's of Transmission**
*   **F**lies
*   **F**ingers
*   **F**eces
*   **F**ood
*   **F**omites

### **3. Clinical Features**

*   **Incubation Period:** Usually **10–14 days** (Range: 3 days to 3 weeks).
*   **Onset:** Insidious/Gradual.
*   **Cardinal Signs:**
    *   **Step-ladder pyrexia:** Fever rises gradually over the first week.
    *   **Relative Bradycardia:** Pulse is slow relative to the temperature (Faget's sign).
    *   **[[Rose spots]]:** Pink papules on the trunk (2nd week).
    *   **"Pea Soup" Diarrhea:** Characteristic stool appearance.
*   **Complications:** Occur mainly in the **3rd week**.
    *   Intestinal **Hemorrhage**.
    *   Intestinal **Perforation**.

### **4. Diagnosis**

**Mnemonic: BASU** (Chronological order of positive tests)

| Test | Timing | Clinical Relevance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **B**lood Culture | **1st Week** | **Gold Standard/Mainstay**. Diagnosis in early stage. |
| **A**ntibody (Widal) | **2nd Week** | Measures O and H agglutinins. Often non-specific. |
| **S**tool Culture | **3rd Week** | Positive from 2nd week; detects intestinal shedding. |
| **U**rine Culture | **4th Week** | Less frequently used; positive in later stages. |

### **5. Prevention and Control**

Control strategies target the reservoir, sanitation, and susceptible host.

#### **A. Control of Reservoir (Cases & Carriers)**
1.  **Early Diagnosis & Notification:** Mandatory in many regions.
2.  **Isolation:** Until 3 consecutive stool/urine cultures are negative.
3.  **Disinfection:** Stools and urine must be disinfected (e.g., with 5% cresol).
4.  **Treatment:**
    *   **Drug of Choice:** **Fluoroquinolones** (Ciprofloxacin) or **Cephalosporins** (Ceftriaxone).
    *   *Note:* Chloramphenicol is rarely used now due to resistance and side effects (bone marrow depression).
5.  **Carrier Management:**
    *   **Medical:** Ampicillin or Amoxicillin + Probenecid for 6 weeks.
    *   **Surgical:** **Cholecystectomy** is the most successful approach for chronic carriers.

#### **B. Control of Sanitation**
*   Protection and purification of drinking water.
*   Sanitary disposal of human excreta.
*   Promotion of food hygiene and handwashing.

#### **C. Immunization**

Vaccines are the specific protection measure.

| Feature | **Ty21a (Oral)** | **Vi Polysaccharide (Injectable)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type** | Live Attenuated | Subunit / Inactivated |
| **Schedule** | 1 capsule on days **1, 3, 5** | Single dose IM/SC |
| **Age** | > 2 years (usually >6 yrs) | > 2 years |
| **Booster** | Every **3 years** | Every **3 years** |
| **Storage** | Refrigerate (+2 to +8°C) | Refrigerate (+2 to +8°C) |
| **Contraindication** | Antibiotics (stop 3 days before/after) | Hypersensitivity |

*Note: The older TAB vaccine is no longer recommended due to side effects and low efficacy.*
