### Pie Chart

**Synonyms:** [[Sector Diagram]], [[Circular Diagram]]

**Definition**
A **Pie Chart** is a circular statistical graphic which is divided into slices (sectors) to illustrate numerical proportion. In this diagram, the data are presented as a circle where the degrees of angles and the area of the sectors denote the relative frequency of a character.

**Key Characteristics**
*   **Data Type:** It is used for the presentation of **discrete data** of [[Qualitative Characteristics]] (e.g., Blood groups, Causes of death, Religion).
*   **Composition:** The entire circle represents the **total (100%)** or **360 degrees**. All categories within the pie chart must be **mutually exclusive** and collectively exhaustive (totaling 100%).
*   **Representation:** Instead of comparing the length of a bar (as in bar charts), the **areas of segments** of a circle are compared. The area of each segment depends upon the central angle.

**Construction and Calculation**
To construct a pie chart, the frequency of each category is converted into a corresponding angle in degrees.

*   **Total Angle:** The total angle at the center of the circle is **360°**.
*   **Formula:**
    $$ \text{Angle of Sector} = \frac{\text{Frequency of the Item}}{\text{Total Frequency}} \times 360^{\circ} $$
    *OR*
    $$ \text{Angle of Sector} = \text{Percentage of the Item} \times 3.6^{\circ} $$
    *(Since $360^{\circ} / 100 = 3.6^{\circ}$)*.

**Uses and Applications**
1.  **Composition Analysis:** To show how a total is divided into component parts (e.g., distribution of budget, composition of diet/nutritive value).
2.  **Demographics:** To show population distribution by age, religion, or social class.
3.  **Disease Burden:** To visualize the share of total disease burden by cause (e.g., DALYs) or causes of mortality.
4.  **Lay Presentation:** They are extremely popular with the lay public as they are visually appealing and easy to understand.

**Advantages and Disadvantages**
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Good for showing **percentage contribution** of parts to a whole.
    *   Visually effective for general/mass awareness.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   **Comparison Difficulty:** Statisticians often consider them inferior to [[Bar Charts]] because it is harder for the human eye to compare the relative sizes of areas/angles than to compare the lengths of bars.
    *   **Clutter:** If there are too many categories, the chart becomes cluttered and difficult to read. It is often necessary to indicate percentages inside the segments for clarity.

**Clinical Relevance**
*   Used to display the distribution of **ABO blood groups** in a population.
*   Used to illustrate **nutritive values** of various food items to patients.
*   Used to present data on **causes of death** or morbidity in a community diagnosis report.

**Mnemonic to Remember Calculation**
**"P-3.6"**
*   **P** = **P**ercentage
*   **3.6** = Multiply by **3.6** to get the degrees.
