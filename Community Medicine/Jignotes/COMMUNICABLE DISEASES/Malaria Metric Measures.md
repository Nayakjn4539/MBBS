# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Malaria Metric Measures

# [[Malaria Metric Measures]]

To assess the burden of malaria and the effectiveness of control programs, specific epidemiological indices are used. These are broadly classified based on the era of malaria control strategies: the **Eradication Era** (Modern/Current) and the **Pre-Eradication Era** (Classical).

### 1. Eradication Era Measures (Current Incidence Levels)
These parameters are primarily parasitological and are used in the current **[[National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme]] (NVBDCP)**. They depend heavily on the efficiency of the case detection machinery.

#### A. [[Annual Parasite Incidence]] (API)
*   **Definition:** It is a sophisticated measure of malaria incidence in a community. It is the most common index used at present.
*   **Formula:**
    $$ \text{API} = \frac{\text{Confirmed cases during one year}}{\text{Population under surveillance}} \times 1000 $$
*   **Significance:**
    *   It helps estimate the **disease burden**.
    *   It is the criterion for stratifying areas into high or low risk.
    *   **Target:** The goal is to bring API to **< 1 case per 1000 population**.
    *   **Classification based on API:**
        *   **API > 2:** High-risk area (eligible for vector control).
        *   **API < 1:** Progressing towards elimination.

#### B. [[Annual Blood Examination Rate]] (ABER)
*   **Definition:** An index of **operational efficiency** of the surveillance system.
*   **Formula:**
    $$ \text{ABER} = \frac{\text{Number of slides examined}}{\text{Population}} \times 100 $$
*   **Target:** A sufficient number of blood slides must be examined to ensure API is accurate. The target is **> 10%** of the population.

#### C. [[Slide Positivity Rate]] (SPR)
*   **Definition:** The percentage of slides found positive for malaria parasites irrespective of the species.
*   **Formula:**
    $$ \text{SPR} = \frac{\text{Number of positive slides}}{\text{Total slides examined}} \times 100 $$
*   **Significance:**
    *   It indicates the trend of malaria transmission.
    *   It serves as an **indicator for impending outbreaks**.

#### D. [[Slide Falciparum Rate]] (SFR)
*   **Definition:** The percentage of slides positive specifically for *Plasmodium falciparum*.
*   **Formula:**
    $$ \text{SFR} = \frac{\text{Slides positive for P. falciparum}}{\text{Total slides examined}} \times 100 $$

#### E. [[Annual Falciparum Incidence]] (AFI)
*   **Definition:** Similar to API but specifically calculates the incidence of *P. falciparum* cases per 1000 population.

### 2. Pre-Eradication Era Measures (Classical Malariometry)
These were used when case detection was less robust and are now mostly used for international comparisons in low-resource settings.

#### A. [[Spleen Rate]]
*   **Definition:** The percentage of children between **2 and 10 years of age** showing enlargement of the spleen.
*   **Significance:** Measures the **endemicity** of malaria in a community. Adults are excluded because other causes can enlarge the spleen in them.
*   **Endemicity Classification based on Spleen Rate:**
    *   **< 10%:** Non-malarious / Low endemicity.
    *   **10 – 25%:** Hypoendemic.
    *   **25 – 40%:** Mesoendemic / Endemic.
    *   **> 40%:** Hyperendemic.

#### B. [[Infant Parasite Rate]] (IPR)
*   **Definition:** The percentage of infants (below 1 year) showing malaria parasites in their blood films.
*   **Significance:**
    *   It is the **most sensitive index of recent transmission** of malaria in a locality.
    *   If IPR is **Zero for 3 consecutive years**, it indicates the **absence of malaria transmission**.

#### C. [[Parasite Rate]]
*   **Definition:** Percentage of children (2–10 years) showing parasites in blood films.

#### D. [[Proportional Case Rate]]
*   **Definition:** Number of clinical malaria cases diagnosed per 100 patients attending hospitals/dispensaries. It is a crude index.

### 3. Vector Indices (Entomological Parameters)
These measure the vector's capability to transmit the disease.

| Index | Definition | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Human Blood Index]]** | Proportion of female anophelines containing human blood. | Indicates degree of anthrophilism (preference for humans). |
| **[[Sporozoite Rate]]** | % of female anophelines with sporozoites in salivary glands. | Indicates infectivity of the vector population. |
| **[[Mosquito Density]]** | Number of mosquitoes per man-hour catch. | Measures vector abundance. |
| **[[Inoculation Rate]]** | Man-biting rate $\times$ Sporozoite rate. | Estimates the risk of infection. |

### Summary Table: Key Malaria Indicators

| Indicator | Formula / Criteria | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **API** | (Cases / Pop) $\times$ 1000 | Burden of Disease (Target < 1) |
| **ABER** | (Slides / Pop) $\times$ 100 | Operational Efficiency (Target > 10%) |
| **SPR** | (+ve slides / Examined) $\times$ 100 | Outbreak Potential |
| **IPR** | % Infants with parasites | Recent Transmission |
| **Spleen Rate** | % Children (2-10y) with splenomegaly | Endemicity Level |

### Mnemonic for Indicators
**"S.I.P. A. B.E.E.R."**
*   **S**pleen Rate (Endemicity)
*   **I**nfant Parasite Rate (Recent transmission)
*   **P**arasite Rate (Children 2-10 yrs)
*   **A**PI (Burden)
*   **B**lood **E**xamination **E**xchange **R**ate (ABER - Efficiency)

**Clinical Relevance:**
*   **Epidemic Forecasting:** A rise in **SPR** often precedes an epidemic curve, acting as an early warning signal for health officers to initiate vector control.
*   **Elimination Certification:** Sustained **Zero IPR** and **API < 1** are critical milestones for moving a district or state from the "Control" phase to the "Elimination" phase,.
