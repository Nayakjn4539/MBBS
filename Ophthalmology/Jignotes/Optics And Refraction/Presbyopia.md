# [[Optics And Refraction]] > Presbyopia

### **Presbyopia**

**Presbyopia** (literally "eye sight of old age") is not an error of refraction but a condition of **physiological insufficiency of [[accommodation]]** leading to a progressive fall in near vision. It is a part of the natural aging process where the near point of accommodation recedes beyond the normal reading or working range.

---

### **Etiopathogenesis**
The decrease in accommodative power of the [[crystalline lens]] with increasing age occurs due to:
1.  **Age-related changes in the lens:**
    *   Progressive increase in size and hardness (**sclerosis**) of the lens substance (nucleus), making it less easily moulded.
    *   Decrease in the elasticity of the [[lens capsule]].
2.  **Age-related decline in ciliary muscle power:** General weakness of the muscle may contribute, though less significantly than lens changes.

---

### **Clinical Features**
The onset is usually gradual. While the condition progresses throughout life, symptoms typically manifest when the near point recedes beyond 25–33 cm (around 40–45 years of age).

#### **Symptoms**
*   **Difficulty in near vision:** The patient holds reading material farther away than usual. Difficulty is noted with small print (e.g., phone screens, newspapers) or tasks like threading a needle.
*   **Worsening in dim light:** Symptoms are aggravated in the evening or dim illumination.
*   **[[Asthenopia]]:** Eye strain, brow ache, and tiredness after reading or near work due to fatigue of the ciliary muscle.
*   **Intermittent [[diplopia]]:** Occasionally experienced due to a disturbed relationship between accommodation and convergence.

#### **Premature Presbyopia**
Presbyopia may manifest earlier (before age 40) in the following conditions:
*   Uncorrected [[hypermetropia]].
*   Premature sclerosis of the lens.
*   General debility causing weakness of ciliary muscles.
*   Chronic simple [[glaucoma]].

### **Management**

#### **1. Optical Treatment (Spectacles)**
The treatment consists of prescribing appropriate **convex (plus) lenses** for near work to supplement the failing accommodation.

**Principles of Prescription:**
*   **Distance Correction First:** Always determine and correct the refractive error for distance first.
*   **Near Addition:** The presbyopic add is combined with the distance correction.
*   **Reserve Accommodation:** The weakest convex lens that allows clear vision at the near point should be prescribed. Approximately **one-third** of the amplitude of accommodation should be kept in reserve to allow comfortable vision.
*   **Individual Needs:** The prescription depends on the patient's profession and working distance (e.g., a goldsmith needs a closer working distance than a computer user).

**Rough Guide for Presbyopic Addition (in Emmetropes):**
*[Note: Maximum correction is usually never > +3.5 D]*

| Age (Years) | Near Addition (Diopters) |
| :--- | :--- |
| 40 | +1.0 D |
| 45 | +1.5 D |
| 50 | +2.0 D |
| 55 | +2.5 D |
| 60 | +2.5 D to +3.0 D |
| >60 | +3.0 D to +3.5 D |

**Types of Spectacle Lenses:**
*   **Reading Glasses (Monofocal):** For near vision only. Useful if distance vision is normal.
*   **Bifocals:**
    *   Upper segment for distance, lower for near.
    *   Types: **Executive** (entire lower half), **D-shaped/Cryptok**, **Round top**.
    *   **Disadvantage:** Image jump (prismatic effect) at the dividing line and cosmetic appearance.

*   **Progressive Addition Lenses (PALs) / Varifocals:**
    *   Provide a continuous range of vision from distance to near without a visible dividing line.
    *   **Advantage:** Cosmetically appealing; clear intermediate vision.
    *   **Disadvantage:** Peripheral distortion; requires adaptation.

#### **2. Contact Lenses**
*   **Monovision:** One eye (usually dominant) corrected for distance, the other for near.
*   **Multifocal Contact Lenses:** Simultaneous vision principle (diffractive or refractive).

#### **3. Surgical Management**
Surgical correction for presbyopia is gaining popularity, though glasses remain the standard.

**A. Cornea-Based Procedures:**
*   **Conductive Keratoplasty (CK):** Radiofrequency energy shrinks peripheral corneal collagen to steepen the central cornea (Monovision technique).
*   **Presbyopic [[LASIK]]:** Creates a multifocal corneal surface (e.g., central steepening for near) or Monovision LASIK.
*   **Corneal Inlays:** Small devices implanted in the corneal stroma (e.g., KAMRA inlay) to increase depth of focus.

**B. Lens-Based Procedures:**
*   **Refractive Lens Exchange (RLE) / PRELEX:** Removal of the clear crystalline lens and replacement with an **Intraocular Lens ([[IOL]])**.
    *   **Multifocal IOLs:** Provide distance and near foci.
    *   **Accommodating IOLs:** Move anteriorly/posteriorly or change shape to adjust focus (e.g., Crystalens).
    *   **Extended Depth of Focus (EDOF) IOLs:** Provide a continuous range of vision.

**C. Sclera-Based Procedures:**
*   **Scleral Expansion Bands:** Theorized to expand the scleral ring to restore ciliary muscle function (Results are controversial).

### **Clinical Implications: Effect of Refractive Errors**
*   **[[Hypermetropia]]:** Presbyopia sets in **earlier** (Premature Presbyopia). They need stronger plus lenses for near work than emmetropes of the same age.
*   **[[Myopia]]:** Presbyopia sets in **later**.
    *   A myope of -1.0 D to -3.0 D may simply remove their distance glasses to read ("Second Sight" phenomenon is different; it refers to index myopia in nuclear cataract improving near vision).
    *   Myopes require *weaker* plus additions or no addition depending on their degree of myopia.
