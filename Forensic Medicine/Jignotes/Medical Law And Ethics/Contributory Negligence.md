# [[Medical Law And Ethics]] > Contributory Negligence

### Contributory Negligence

**Definition**
[[Contributory negligence]] is defined as any unreasonable conduct, or absence of ordinary care on the part of the patient (or their attendant), which combined with the doctor's negligence, contributed to the injury complained of, as a direct, proximate cause and without which the injury would not have occurred.

In simpler terms, it is the **concurrent negligence** of both the patient and the doctor that results in damage. The doctor acts negligently, but the patient also fails to take reasonable self-care, exacerbating or causing the harm.

**Key Components**
1.  **Concurrent Fault:** Both the [[physician]] and the [[patient]] are negligent at the same time or in a sequence leading to the injury.
2.  **Proximate Cause:** The patient's action (or inaction) must be a direct contributing factor to the injury.
3.  **Absence of Ordinary Care:** The patient failed to act as a prudent, reasonable person would under similar circumstances.

**Common Examples in Clinical Practice**
The following scenarios are often cited as contributory negligence by the defense:

*   **Failure to provide accurate history:** The patient deliberately hides a known [[drug allergy]] or history of previous illness, leading to a reaction.
*   **Non-compliance:** Failure to follow the doctor's specific instructions regarding diet, medication dosage, or physical activity.
*   **Refusal of treatment/investigations:** The patient refuses necessary diagnostic tests (e.g., X-ray for a suspected fracture) or treatment options.
*   **Leaving Against Medical Advice ([[LAMA]]):** The patient leaves the hospital before treatment is complete, worsening their condition.
*   **Failure to follow-up:** The patient does not return for scheduled check-ups or dressing changes, leading to complications like infection.
*   **Interference:** The patient or attendant interferes with the treatment equipment (e.g., removing an IV line or splint).

**Legal Status and Application**

| Feature | Civil Cases | Criminal Cases |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Validity as Defense** | **Good Defense (Affirmative Defense).** It is a valid plea for the doctor. | **Not a Defense.** It has no place in criminal prosecution. |
| **Outcome** | Usually results in a **reduction of compensation** (damages) awarded to the patient. The liability is shared. | The doctor is judged solely on their [[gross negligence]]. The patient's negligence does not absolve the doctor of criminal liability. |
| **Burden of Proof** | The burden of proving contributory negligence lies with the **Doctor (Defendant)**. | The prosecution must prove the doctor's guilt; contributory negligence is irrelevant. |

**Doctrines Limiting Contributory Negligence**
Even if a patient was negligent, the doctor cannot always use this defense. The following rules limit its application:

**1. The Last Clear Chance Doctrine**
*   Even if the patient was negligent and placed themselves in danger, the doctor is liable if they had the **last clear opportunity** to avoid the damage but failed to do so.
*   *Example:* A patient overdoses on drugs (patient's negligence), but comes to the ER. If the doctor fails to treat the overdose properly (doctor's negligence), the doctor cannot claim contributory negligence because the doctor had the *last chance* to save the patient.

**2. The Avoidable Consequences Rule**
*   This applies when the patient's negligence occurs **after** the doctor's negligent act.
*   The patient is not guilty of contributory negligence for the *original* injury caused by the doctor, but their subsequent negligence increased the severity of the damage.
*   *Example:* A surgeon leaves a swab inside a patient (Doctor's negligence). Later, the patient feels pain but refuses to see a doctor for weeks, causing severe sepsis (Patient's negligence). The patient can claim damages for the swab but *not* for the aggravated sepsis that could have been avoided by seeking help earlier.

**Comparison: Contributory vs. Composite Negligence**

| Feature | Contributory Negligence | Composite Negligence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Who is Negligent?** | Doctor + **Patient** | **Multiple Doctors/Staff** (Patient is innocent) |
| **Example** | Patient doesn't take meds prescribed by a negligent doctor. | Surgeon and Anesthetist are both negligent during surgery. |
| **Liability** | Damages are reduced/shared between doctor and patient. | All negligent parties are jointly and severally liable. |

**Medicolegal Aspects**
*   **Documentation:** The doctor must document all instructions given, non-compliance, and refusals in the [[medical records]]. Without written proof (e.g., "Patient advised X but refused"), this defense is difficult to prove in court.
*   **Duty to Warn:** The doctor cannot plead contributory negligence if they failed to give proper, clear instructions to the patient in the first place.
*   **Children and Insane Persons:** Generally, the law presumes that children (usually under 7-12 years depending on jurisdiction) and mentally ill persons are incapable of contributory negligence. The duty of care falls entirely on the doctor/guardian.

**Mnemonic: "LAST ACT"**
To remember the limitations and nature:
*   **L** - **L**ast clear chance doctrine (Doctor liable if they had the last chance).
*   **A** - **A**voidable consequences rule (Patient liable for subsequent aggravation).
*   **S** - **S**hared liability (In civil cases).
*   **T** - **T**otally useless in Criminal cases (Not a defense).
*   **A** - **A**bsence of ordinary care by patient.
*   **C** - **C**ivil defense only.
*   **T** - **T**wo parties negligent (Doctor + Patient).
