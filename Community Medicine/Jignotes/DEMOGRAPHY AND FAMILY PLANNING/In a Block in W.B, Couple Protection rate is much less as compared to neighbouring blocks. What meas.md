# [[DEMOGRAPHY AND FAMILY PLANNING]] > In a Block in W.B, Couple Protection rate is much less as compared to neighbouring blocks. What measures will you take as BMOH to improve the situation? Mention Goals of National Population policy.

### Measures to Improve Low Couple Protection Rate (CPR) as BMOH

As a Block Medical Officer of Health (BMOH), improving the [[Couple Protection Rate (CPR)]] requires a systematic approach focusing on community needs, service delivery, and monitoring. The CPR reflects the prevalence of contraceptive practice in the community, and a rate >60% is generally required to achieve a Net Reproduction Rate (NRR) of 1.

**1. Situational Analysis and Planning**
*   **Community Needs Assessment Approach (CNAA):** Shift from target-oriented to a demand-driven approach. Consult families and community leaders to assess actual needs and preferences for contraception rather than imposing targets from above.
*   **Update Eligible Couple Register:** Ensure the [[Eligible Couple]] register is updated by the ANMs and ASHAs at the sub-center level to track non-users and drop-outs.
*   **Identify Gap Areas:** Analyze sub-center wise performance to identify villages with the highest "unmet need" for family planning.

**2. Strengthening Service Delivery**
*   **Cafeteria Approach:** Ensure a "basket of choice" is available. Provide a wide range of contraceptives (condoms, OCPs, IUDs, injectables) so couples can choose the best method for their needs.
*   **Fixed Day Static Services (FDS):** Organize sterilization (tubectomy/vasectomy) and IUD insertion services on fixed days/times at the PHC/CHC to ensure predictability and reliability for clients.
*   **Mission Parivar Vikas Strategy:** If the block falls under high fertility districts, implement specific strategies like delivering assured services and building capacity.
*   **Post-Partum Services:** Strengthen [[Postpartum Intrauterine Contraceptive Device]] (PPIUCD) services immediately after institutional deliveries.

**3. Capacity Building and Human Resources**
*   **Training:** Retrain ANMs and ASHAs in the **GATHER approach** for counseling (Greet, Ask, Tell, Help, Explain, Return) to improve acceptance and continuation rates.
*   **Incentives:** Ensure timely disbursement of compensation/incentives to beneficiaries and ASHAs (e.g., for delaying the first child or spacing) to keep motivation high.

**4. Information, Education, and Communication (IEC)**
*   **Focus on Spacing:** Shift focus from terminal methods to spacing methods (IUDs, OCPs) for younger couples.
*   **Male Participation:** Promote Non-Scalpel Vasectomy (NSV) and condom usage to increase male involvement in family planning.
*   **Address Myths:** Conduct focus group discussions to dispel myths regarding contraceptive side effects.

**5. Monitoring and Evaluation**
*   **Regular Reviews:** Conduct monthly review meetings with ANMs and supervisors to track progress against the CNAA plans.
*   **Follow-up:** Ensure strict follow-up of contraceptive users to manage side effects and prevent drop-outs.

### Goals of National Population Policy (NPP) 2000

The [[National Population Policy 2000]] affirms the commitment to voluntary and informed choice and consent of citizens while availing reproductive health care services.

#### A. Policy Objectives
| Time Frame | Objective |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Immediate** | Address unmet needs for contraception, health infrastructure, and health personnel; provide integrated service delivery for basic reproductive and child health care. |
| **Medium-term** | Bring the [[Total Fertility Rate]] (TFR) to replacement levels (TFR = 2.1) by 2010. |
| **Long-term** | Achieve a stable population by 2045. |

#### B. National Socio-Demographic Goals (to be achieved by 2010)
These goals were set to facilitate the implementation of the policy:

1.  **Address Unmet Needs:** For basic reproductive and child health services, supplies, and infrastructure.
2.  **Education:** Make school education up to age 14 free and compulsory; reduce dropouts to <20%.
3.  **Infant Mortality:** Reduce [[Infant Mortality Rate]] (IMR) to below 30 per 1000 live births.
4.  **Maternal Mortality:** Reduce [[Maternal Mortality Ratio]] (MMR) to below 100 per 100,000 live births.
5.  **Immunization:** Achieve universal immunization of children against all vaccine-preventable diseases.
6.  **Delayed Marriage:** Promote delayed marriage for girls, not earlier than 18, preferably after 20 years of age.
7.  **Institutional Deliveries:** Achieve 80% institutional deliveries and 100% deliveries by trained persons.
8.  **Registration:** Achieve 100% registration of births, deaths, marriages, and pregnancies.
9.  **Disease Control:** Contain the spread of HIV/AIDS; integration of RTI/STI management with NACO.
10. **Communicable Diseases:** Prevent and control communicable diseases.
11. **AYUSH Integration:** Integrate Indian Systems of Medicine (ISM) in the provision of RCH services.
12. **Small Family Norm:** Promote vigorously the small family norm to achieve replacement levels of TFR.
13. **Convergence:** Bring convergence in the implementation of related social sector programs.

### Mnemonics for NPP Goals

**"RIM for Stable Population"** (Objectives)
*   **R** - Reproductive health infrastructure (Immediate)
*   **I** - Immediate unmet needs (Immediate)
*   **M** - Medium term (TFR 2.1)
*   **Stable Population** - Long term goal (2045)

**"MISTER D"** (Key Demographic Goals)
*   **M** - MMR < 100
*   **I** - IMR < 30
*   **S** - Small family norm / School education free
*   **T** - TFR 2.1 (Replacement level)
*   **E** - Eighty percent (80%) Institutional deliveries
*   **R** - Registration 100% (Births/Deaths/Marriage)
*   **D** - Delayed marriage for girls (>18/20)

### Clinical Relevance
Improving CPR is not just about population control; it has direct clinical benefits. **Birth Spacing** (achieved through CPR) significantly reduces the risk of:
*   Maternal anemia and malnutrition.
*   Low Birth Weight (LBW) babies.
*   Pre-term births and infant mortality.
