# [[Nose]] > Paranasal Sinuses

### **Paranasal Sinuses: Anatomy and Physiology**

The [[paranasal sinuses]] are air-filled cavities located within the bones of the skull and face. They are lined by ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium (respiratory epithelium/[[Schneiderian membrane]]) and communicate with the nasal cavity through specific ostia.

---

### **1. Classification and Development**

The sinuses are generally classified into two groups based on their drainage in relation to the **basal lamella** (ground lamella) of the [[middle turbinate]].

| Group | Sinuses Included | Drainage Site |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Anterior Group** | Maxillary, Frontal, Anterior Ethmoid | [[Middle Meatus]] |
| **Posterior Group** | Posterior Ethmoid, Sphenoid | [[Superior Meatus]] / [[Sphenoethmoidal Recess]] |

**Developmental Timeline:**
*   **Maxillary & Ethmoid:** Present at birth (biphasic growth for maxillary).
*   **Sphenoid:** Absent at birth; distinct pneumatization starts around age 4; adult size by 15.
*   **Frontal:** Absent at birth; invades frontal bone at age 4; complete by 20 years.

### **2. Anatomy of Specific Sinuses**

#### **A. Maxillary Sinus (Antrum of Highmore)**
This is the largest paranasal sinus, pyramidal in shape, with a capacity of approximately 15 ml in adults.

*   **Boundaries:**
    *   **Roof:** Floor of the [[orbit]] (traversed by the infraorbital nerve/vessels).
    *   **Floor:** Alveolar process of the [[maxilla]]. (Related to the roots of premolars and molars; extraction can cause [[oroantral fistula]]).
    *   **Base (Medial wall):** Lateral wall of the nose.
    *   **Apex:** Zygomatic process.
    *   **Anterior Wall:** Cheek/canine fossa.
    *   **Posterior Wall:** Pterygopalatine and Infratemporal fossa.
*   **Drainage:** The natural ostium is located high on the medial wall (disadvantageous against gravity), draining into the posterior part of the [[ethmoidal infundibulum]].
*   **Clinical Note:** An accessory ostium may be present in the fontanelle (membranous part of the lateral nasal wall) in 30% of cases.

#### **B. Ethmoid Sinus (Ethmoid Labyrinth)**
Consists of a honeycomb of 3–18 thin-walled air cells located between the upper lateral nasal wall and the medial wall of the orbit.

*   **Lateral Boundary:** The [[lamina papyracea]] (paper-thin bone separating sinus from the orbit).
*   **Roof:** [[Fovea ethmoidalis]] (frontal bone) and lateral lamella of the cribriform plate.
*   **Important Named Cells:**
    1.  **[[Agger Nasi]]:** The anterior-most ethmoid cell; located anterior to the middle turbinate attachment. Key landmark for the [[frontal recess]].
    2.  **[[Haller Cells]] (Infraorbital ethmoid cells):** Located in the floor of the orbit/roof of the maxillary sinus. Can narrow the maxillary ostium.
    3.  **[[Onodi Cells]] (Sphenoethmoidal cells):** Posterior-most ethmoid cells that extend laterally/superiorly to the sphenoid sinus. **Crucial:** The [[optic nerve]] and [[internal carotid artery]] may lie naked within these cells.
    4.  **[[Bulla Ethmoidalis]]:** The largest and most constant anterior ethmoid cell.

#### **C. Frontal Sinus**
Situated between the inner and outer tables of the frontal bone. Highly variable in size; often asymmetrical.

*   **Drainage:** Drains via the **frontal recess** (not a true duct) into the middle meatus.
*   **Relations:**
    *   Anterior: Forehead skin.
    *   Posterior: Anterior cranial fossa (frontal lobe).
    *   Inferior: Orbit.
*   **Clinical Note:** Infection here can lead to Osteomyelitis of the anterior table, presenting as a soft doughy swelling known as **[[Pott's puffy tumor]]**.

#### **D. Sphenoid Sinus**
Located deep within the body of the sphenoid bone. The two sides are separated by an intersinus septum which is often deviated.

*   **Relations (The "Danger" Sinus):**
    *   **Superior:** [[Pituitary gland]] (sella turcica), Optic chiasm.
    *   **Lateral:** [[Cavernous sinus]], Internal Carotid Artery (ICA), Cranial Nerves III, IV, V1, V2, VI.
    *   **Posterior:** Clivus, Pons.
*   **Drainage:** Opens into the **sphenoethmoidal recess** (above the superior turbinate).
*   **Pneumatization Types:**
    1.  **Conchal:** No pneumatization (solid bone).
    2.  **Presellar:** Air does not extend beyond the anterior border of the sella.
    3.  **Sellar (Post-sellar):** Pneumatization extends below and behind the sella (most common type; safest for trans-sphenoidal pituitary surgery).

### **3. The Osteomeatal Complex (OMC)**

The OMC is not a single anatomical structure but a functional unit in the middle meatus that serves as the common drainage pathway for the anterior group of sinuses (Frontal, Maxillary, Anterior Ethmoid).

**Key Structures of the OMC:**
1.  **[[Uncinate Process]]:** Sickle-shaped bony hook.
2.  **[[Hiatus Semilunaris]]:** The crescent-shaped gap between the uncinate process and the ethmoid bulla.
3.  **[[Ethmoid Infundibulum]]:** A channel lateral to the uncinate process where the maxillary sinus drains.
4.  **[[Bulla Ethmoidalis]]:** Anterior ethmoid cell forming the posterior border of the hiatus.

> **Clinical Implication:** Blockage of the OMC is the primary event in the pathophysiology of most cases of chronic [[rhinosinusitis]]. It is the primary target of [[Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery]] (FESS).

### **4. Physiology of Paranasal Sinuses**

#### **A. Functions**
While debated, the accepted functions include:
*   **Air-conditioning:** Humidification and warming of inspired air (along with nasal mucosa).
*   **Resonance:** Adds quality to the voice.
*   **Protection:** Acts as a "crumple zone" or thermal insulator for the orbit and brain.
*   **Weight Reduction:** Lightens the heavy skull bones.
*   **Local Defense:** Production of nitric oxide (bacteriostatic) and local immunoglobulins (IgA).

#### **B. Ventilation**
*   **Paradoxical Ventilation:** Unlike the lungs, sinuses empty air during inspiration (due to negative pressure in the nose, $-6$ to $-200$ mm H2O) and fill with air (via eddies) during expiration (positive pressure). This ensures slow air exchange.

#### **C. Mucociliary Clearance**
The mucus blanket consists of a "sol" layer (thin, periciliary) and a "gel" layer (viscous, superficial). Cilia beat 10–20 times/second to move this blanket toward the natural ostia.

*   **Maxillary Sinus:** Secretions move in a **stellate pattern** against gravity towards the natural ostium. *Note: Creating a surgical window in the inferior meatus does not change this pattern; mucus will bypass the surgical window to reach the natural ostium*.
*   **Frontal Sinus:** Mucus circulates up the medial wall and down the lateral wall towards the frontal recess.
*   **Sphenoid & Ethmoid:** Drain towards their respective meati/recesses.

#### **D. The Nasal Cycle**
A physiologic congestion and decongestion cycle of the cavernous tissues (turbinates) alternating between sides every 2.5 to 4 hours. It is controlled by the autonomic nervous system (Hypothalamus).
