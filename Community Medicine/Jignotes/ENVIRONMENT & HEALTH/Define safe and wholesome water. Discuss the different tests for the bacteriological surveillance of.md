# [[ENVIRONMENT & HEALTH]] > Define "safe and wholesome water". Discuss the different tests for the bacteriological surveillance of drinking water.

### Safe and Wholesome Water

Water intended for human consumption must be both **safe** and **wholesome**. This is a standard definition in public health engineering and community medicine.

**Definition:**
Water is defined as **safe and wholesome** if it meets the following four criteria:
1.  Free from [[pathogenic agents]].
2.  Free from harmful **chemical substances**.
3.  Pleasant to the taste (i.e., free from color and odor).
4.  Usable for **domestic purposes**.

*Note: Water is considered "polluted" or "contaminated" if it fails to meet these criteria.*

***

### Bacteriological Surveillance of Drinking Water

Ideally, drinking water should not contain *any* pathogenic microorganisms. However, testing for every specific pathogen (like *Salmonella* or *Vibrio*) is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult. Therefore, we look for **Biological Indicators** of fecal pollution.

#### 1. Bacteriological Indicators
These organisms indicate that fecal contamination has occurred, implying that pathogens *might* be present.

| Indicator Organism | Significance |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Coliform organisms]]** (e.g., *E. coli*) | **Primary Indicator.** Indicates fecal pollution. *E. coli* is the most specific indicator of fecal contamination. |
| **[[Faecal streptococci]]** | Indicates **Recent** contamination. They survive shorter than coliforms but are more resistant to drying. |
| **[[Clostridium perfringens]]** | Indicates **Remote/Past** contamination. Spores survive longer in water and resist chlorination better than coliforms. |

> **Mnemonic for Indicators:**
> **"Recent Strep, Remote Clost, but E. coli is the Boss."**
> *   **Recent** contamination = Fecal **Strep**tococci
> *   **Remote** (Old) contamination = **Clost**ridium perfringens
> *   **E. coli** = Primary (Boss) indicator.

#### 2. Methods of Examination
A complete bacteriological examination consists of the following tests:

**A. Presumptive Coliform Test ([[Multiple Tube Method]])**
This estimates the **Most Probable Number ([[MPN]])** of coliform organisms in 100 ml of water.

*   **Principle:** Coliforms ferment lactose with the production of acid and gas at 37°C.
*   **Media:** [[MacConkey's Lactose Bile Salt Broth]].
*   **Indicator:** Bromocresol purple.
*   **Method:**
    *   Inoculate water into tubes containing the media (volumes of 0.1, 1.0, 10, and 50 ml).
    *   Incubate at **37°C** for **48 hours**.
*   **Positive Result:** Change in color (Acid) + Gas bubble in Durham's tube.
*   **Interpretation:** The number of positive tubes is compared to statistical **McCrady’s tables** to find the MPN.

**B. Confirmatory Tests ([[Eijkman Test]])**
Since the presumptive test can be positive due to non-fecal organisms, confirmation is required, especially for *E. coli*.

*   **Procedure:** Subculture from the presumptive positive tubes into two tubes of **Brilliant Green Bile Broth**.
*   **Incubation:**
    1.  **Tube 1 at 37°C** for 48 hours: Confirms Total Coliforms.
    2.  **Tube 2 at 44°C** for 6-24 hours: Confirms **[[Thermotolerant Coliforms]]** (usually *E. coli*).
*   **Key Distinction:** Only *E. coli* produces gas from lactose at **44°C**.
*   *Note: Further confirmation can be done by testing for Indole production at 44°C.*

**C. [[Membrane Filtration Technique]]**
This is a standard procedure in many countries.

*   **Method:** A measured volume of water is filtered through a sterile cellulose ester membrane. Bacteria are retained on the surface.
*   **Culture:** The membrane is placed on a suitable nutrient medium and incubated.
*   **Result:** Colonies are counted directly.
*   **Advantages:** Faster results (20 hours vs 72-96 hours for MPN) and allows direct counting rather than statistical estimation.

**D. Colony Count (Standard Plate Count)**
Estimates the general bacterial purity of water.

*   **Method:** Inoculate nutrient agar with water sample.
*   **Incubation:**
    *   One set at **37°C** (2 days): Detects parasitic/pathogenic bacteria.
    *   One set at **22°C** (3 days): Detects saprophytic/natural bacteria.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   A single count is of little value; sudden increases indicate pollution.
    *   **Disinfected water:** Should ideally have a count of **0** at 37°C.

### Clinical Relevance
*   **[[Water-borne diseases]]:** Failure in bacteriological surveillance leads to outbreaks of Cholera, Typhoid, Dysentery, and Hepatitis A/E.
*   **Epidemics:** A sudden rise in colony counts or positive coliform tests often precedes community outbreaks of diarrheal diseases.
