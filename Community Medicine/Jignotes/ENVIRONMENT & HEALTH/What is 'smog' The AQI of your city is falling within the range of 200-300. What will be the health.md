# [[ENVIRONMENT & HEALTH]] > What is 'smog'? The AQI of your city is falling within the range of 200-300. What will be the health effects? What measures can be adopted to tackle the situation?

### Definition of Smog

**Smog** is a portmanteau of two words: **Smoke** and **Fog**. It essentially refers to a condition of the atmosphere where high concentrations of air pollutants are trapped in the lower layers of the atmosphere, often due to [[temperature inversion]] (a weather condition where a layer of warm air sits on top of a layer of cold air near the ground, preventing vertical dispersion of pollutants),.

*   **Composition:** It consists of solid and liquid particles (particulate matter) and gases.
*   **Photochemical Smog:** This is a specific type formed by the interaction of [[hydrocarbons]] and [[oxides of nitrogen]] (from automobile exhaust) in the presence of **sunlight**. This reaction produces secondary pollutants like [[Ozone]] ($O_3$), aldehydes, ketones, and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN).

### Interpretation of AQI (200-300)

The **Air Quality Index (AQI)** is a tool to communicate the quality of air to the public. According to the classification provided in the sources:

*   **AQI < 50:** Good
*   **AQI 100:** Satisfactory
*   **AQI 200 - 300:** **Poor**
*   **AQI > 400:** Severe

**Implication:** An AQI in the range of 200–300 indicates **Poor** air quality. This level of pollution causes breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure and significantly affects people with existing heart or lung diseases.

### Health Effects of Smog and Poor Air Quality

The health effects can be broadly classified into immediate and delayed effects.

#### 1. Immediate (Acute) Effects
*   **Respiratory System:** Acute [[bronchitis]], cough, dyspnea, and suffocation. In severe cases (like the London Smog of 1952), it can lead to immediate death due to respiratory failure.
*   **Irritation:** [[Sulphur dioxide]] and [[Ozone]] act as strong irritants to the eyes (conjunctivitis), nose, and throat,.
*   **Exacerbation:** Sudden increase in morbidity and hospital admissions for [[asthma]] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

#### 2. Delayed (Chronic) Effects
*   **Chronic Lung Diseases:** Chronic bronchitis, [[emphysema]], and bronchial asthma.
*   **Malignancy:** Increased risk of [[lung cancer]] due to carcinogens like benzpyrene found in smoke,.
*   **Lead Toxicity:** Inhalation of lead (from automobile exhaust) poisons the nervous system. In children, it causes impaired neuropsychological development, loss of IQ, and behavioral difficulties.

**Clinical Relevance:**
*   **Vulnerable Groups:** The elderly, children, smokers, and those with pre-existing chronic respiratory or cardiac difficulties are most vulnerable.
*   **Pregnancy Outcomes:** Exposure to high levels of lead and carbon monoxide can lead to low birth weight, stillbirths, and miscarriage,.

### Measures to Tackle the Situation (Prevention and Control)

The WHO recommends the following general principles and practical measures to control air pollution,:

#### 1. Containment (Prevention of Escape)
*   **Definition:** Preventing toxic substances from escaping into the ambient air.
*   **Methods:** Using engineering methods such as enclosures, ventilation, and air cleaning. Development of **"arresters"** to remove contaminants at the source,.

#### 2. Replacement (Technological Change)
*   **Fuel Substitution:** Replacing coal and wood with electricity, natural gas, or solar power in industries and domestic settings,.
*   **Vehicle Modification:** Reducing lead in petrol (using [[unleaded petrol]]) and phasing out older vehicles. Use of catalytic reactors in vehicles to convert CO to $CO_2$ and Nitrogen oxides to Nitrogen.

#### 3. Dilution (Self-Cleansing)
*   **Green Belts:** Establishment of vegetation and green belts between industrial and residential areas. Vegetation helps remove certain pollutants and acts as a barrier,.
*   **Note:** This is valid only as long as the environment's self-cleansing capacity is not overburdened.

#### 4. Legislation (Legal Control)
*   Enforcement of laws such as the **[[Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981]]** in India,.
*   Creation of **smokeless zones** and enforcement of ambient air quality standards.

#### 5. International Action
*   Collaboration with the **WHO international network** of laboratories for monitoring air pollution.
*   Adherence to global protocols like the **[[Kyoto Protocol]]** to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,.

#### 6. Health Education
*   Educating the public and workers about the health risks of air pollution and personal protection measures (e.g., avoiding outdoor activities during smog, using masks).

**Mnemonic for Control Measures: "C-R-D-L"**
*   **C** - **C**ontainment
*   **R** - **R**eplacement
*   **D** - **D**ilution
*   **L** - **L**egislation
