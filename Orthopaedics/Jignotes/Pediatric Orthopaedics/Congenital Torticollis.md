# Congenital Torticollis (Wry Neck)

### Definition
**Congenital Torticollis**, often referred to as **Wry Neck** or **Twisted Neck**, is a musculoskeletal deformity characterized by the shortening and fibrosis of the [[sternocleidomastoid muscle]] (SCM) on one side of the neck. This results in a characteristic head posture where the head is tilted towards the affected side and the chin is rotated towards the opposite side.

*   **Latin Origin:** *Tortus* (twisted) + *Collum* (neck).

### Etiopathogenesis
The exact cause is idiopathic, but several theories exist regarding the fibrosis of the [[sternocleidomastoid muscle]].

**1. Ischemic Theory (Most Accepted):**
*   Venous occlusion or arterial ischemia of the SCM occurs during intrauterine life or delivery.
*   This leads to muscle necrosis, which is eventually replaced by fibrous tissue (fibromatosis).

**2. Birth Trauma:**
*   There is a strong association with difficult labor.
*   **Risk Factors:**
    *   [[Breech presentation]].
    *   [[Forceps delivery]].
    *   Primipara mothers.
    *   Shoulder dystocia.

**3. "Sternomastoid Tumor" Progression:**
*   **Phase 1 (Tumor Phase):** In the first few weeks of life (usually 3-4 weeks), a palpable lump (fusiform swelling) appears in the SCM. This is likely swollen ischemic muscle.
*   **Phase 2 (Resolution):** The mass usually resolves spontaneously within months.
*   **Phase 3 (Fibrosis):** In some cases, the muscle does not return to normal length but undergoes fibrosis and shortening, leading to the fixed deformity.

### Clinical Features
The presentation varies depending on the age of the child.

#### In Infancy (The Sternomastoid Tumor)
*   **Age:** Usually noted between 3 weeks to 3 months of age.
*   **Palpation:** A firm, non-tender, fusiform mass ("pseudotumor") is palpable in the substance of the [[sternocleidomastoid muscle]].
*   **Location:** Usually in the middle third or lower third of the muscle.
*   **Deformity:** May be mild or absent at this stage.

#### In Early Childhood (Established Deformity)
If the condition persists, the classic **"Cock-Robin"** appearance develops.

**1. Posture (The Deformity):**
*   **Head Tilt:** Towards the **affected** (shortened muscle) side.
*   **Chin Rotation:** Towards the **opposite** (unaffected) side.
    *   *Example:* In Right Torticollis, the right ear approaches the right shoulder, and the chin points to the left.

**2. Limitations:**
*   Restriction of neck rotation towards the affected side.
*   Restriction of lateral flexion away from the affected side.

**3. Secondary Changes (Neglected Cases):**
*   **[[Plagiocephaly]] (Facial Asymmetry):**
    *   The face on the affected side appears smaller and flatter (facial hemiatrophy).
    *   The eye on the affected side may appear lower.
    *   **Mechanism:** Due to molding of the developing skull and facial bones caused by constant abnormal pressure and tension.
*   **Compensatory Scoliosis:** Can develop in the cervical and thoracic spine.
*   **Ocular Disturbances:** May develop over time.

### Associations
It is crucial to screen for other orthopedic anomalies in infants with torticollis.
*   **[[Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip]] (DDH):** Approximately 10-20% association.
*   **[[Metatarsus Adductus]].**
*   **[[Clubfoot]] (CTEV).**

### Differential Diagnosis
Not all wry necks are congenital. The "ABCDE" of Torticollis differential diagnosis:

| Category | Conditions | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Acquired (Traumatic)** | Rotatory Subluxation (C1-C2) | History of trauma/jerk; sudden onset. |
| **Bony Anomalies** | [[Klippel-Feil Syndrome]] | Short neck, low hairline, fused vertebrae on X-ray. |
| **Cervical Inflammation** | TB Spine, Lymphadenitis | Pain, fever, spasm, radiological signs of infection. |
| **Dystonia** | Spasmodic Torticollis | Intermittent contractions, neurological signs. |
| **Eye (Ocular)** | Ocular Torticollis | Head tilt compensates for squint/diplopia. Corrects when lying down. |
| **Posterior Fossa** | Tumors | Headache, vomiting, neurological deficits. |

### Diagnostic Investigations
*   **Ultrasound (USG):** The initial modality of choice in infants. It reveals a focal or diffuse enlargement of the SCM (hypoechoic and homogenous) and differentiates it from other neck masses (e.g., lymph nodes, cystic hygroma).
*   **X-ray Cervical Spine:** Mandatory to rule out bony anomalies like [[hemivertebra]] or atlanto-occipital fusion.
*   **MRI:** Reserved for cases with atypical features, neurological signs, or suspected deep infection/tumors.

### Management

#### 1. Conservative Treatment
Effective in the majority of infants if started early (before 1 year of age).
*   **Observation:** Many "tumors" resolve spontaneously.
*   **Passive Stretching:**
    *   Gentle, controlled stretching of the neck.
    *   Rotate the chin toward the affected side.
    *   Laterally flex the head toward the opposite side.
*   **Positioning/Stimulation:** Encourage the infant to look toward the affected side (e.g., placing toys or the crib in a way that forces rotation to the restricted side).
*   **Splinting:** Use of a collar or brace in mild cases.

#### 2. Surgical Treatment
**Indications:**
*   Failure of conservative treatment.
*   Established deformity in a child older than 1-2 years.
*   facial asymmetry begins to develop.
*   Limitation of rotation of more than 30 degrees.

**Procedures:**
*   **Unipolar Release (Tenotomy):** Release of the SCM at the clavicular/sternal insertion (lower end).
*   **Bipolar Release:** Release of the muscle at both the mastoid (upper) and clavicular/sternal (lower) attachments. This is preferred for severe deformities.
*   **Z-plasty:** Lengthening of the muscle body (rarely done now due to scarring).

**Post-Operative Care:**
*   The head is immobilized in a corrected (or slightly over-corrected) position using a brace or **Callot’s cast** for 3-6 weeks.
*   Rigid physiotherapy is essential after cast removal to maintain range of motion and prevent recurrence.

### Clinical Implications
*   **The "Lump":** A neck mass in a newborn is most commonly a sternomastoid tumor, but malignancy must be ruled out if the presentation is atypical.
*   **Hip Screening:** Every child with congenital muscular torticollis **must** undergo a clinical and/or ultrasound examination of the hips to rule out [[Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip]].
*   **Prognosis:** Excellent with early stretching. Facial asymmetry may persist if surgery is delayed beyond 4–5 years of age.
