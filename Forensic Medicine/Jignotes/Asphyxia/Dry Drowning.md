# [[Asphyxia]] > Dry Drowning

### **Dry Drowning**

**Dry drowning** is a form of [[asphyxia]] resulting from submersion/immersion in liquid where water does not enter the lungs in significant quantities due to immediate and sustained [[laryngeal spasm]].

It acts as a diagnosis of exclusion in bodies found in water.

#### **Mechanism and Pathophysiology**
The primary mechanism is **Laryngeal Spasm** (Reflex vocal cord spasm).
1.  **Contact:** Water (even small amounts) enters the nose/mouth and strikes the larynx.
2.  **Reflex:** This triggers a violent, protective laryngeal spasm to prevent water entry.
3.  **Occlusion:** The airway is completely blocked.
4.  **Result:** No air enters, and no water enters the lungs.
5.  **Death:** Occurs due to acute [[asphyxia]] (Hypoxic hypoxia) and cerebral anoxia.

#### **Causes and Predisposing Factors**
*   **Sudden Immersion:** Unexpected fall into water (especially cold water).
*   **Intoxication:** Seen in alcoholics or epileptics falling into shallow pools.
*   **Sensitivity:** Individuals with hypersensitive laryngeal reflexes.

#### **Current Medical Consensus**
*   According to the **World Congress on Drowning (Amsterdam, 2002)**, terms like "wet drowning," "dry drowning," "active/passive drowning," "near-drowning," and "secondary drowning" should be **discarded**.
*   The recommended uniform definition is: *"Drowning is the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid."*

### **Autopsy Findings**

Unlike typical [[wet drowning]], the findings in dry drowning are non-specific and resemble general mechanical asphyxia.

**1. External Findings**
*   **Froth:** Usually **absent**. If present, it is scanty (unlike the copious, fine, white leathery froth of wet drowning).
*   **Signs of Asphyxia:** Intense cyanosis, congestion of face, and petechial hemorrhages ([[Tardieu's spots]]) are often prominent.
*   **Hands:** May show cadaveric spasm (grasping weeds/mud), indicating the person was alive upon entry, though less common than in wet drowning.

**2. Internal Findings**
*   **Lungs:**
    *   **Not** heavy, boggy, or water-logged.
    *   Do not show [[emphysema aquosum]] (ballooning).
    *   May show congestion and oedema, but are relatively dry compared to wet drowning.
    *   **Note:** In some cases, "dry lungs" may be seen due to absorption of water into the circulation if the victim survived for a short time or resuscitation was attempted (Dry-lung drowning).
*   **Air Passages:** Usually clear of fluid, weeds, or silt. Larynx and trachea are congested.
*   **Stomach:** May contain water (swallowed during the struggle before the spasm set in).
*   **Larynx:** The laryngeal spasm **disappears** after death due to primary muscular flaccidity; hence, the spasm itself cannot be demonstrated at autopsy.

### **Laboratory Investigations**

These tests are generally **negative** or **not useful** in dry drowning because the aspiration of water (and suspended particles) into the pulmonary circulation does not occur.

| Test | Utility in Dry Drowning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Diatom Test]]** | **Negative/Not Useful.** Since water does not enter alveolar-capillary barrier, diatoms do not translocate to bone marrow/organs. |
| **[[Gettler's Test]]** (Chloride Test) | **Not Useful.** No hemodilution (fresh water) or hemoconcentration (salt water) occurs in the left heart. |

### **Differentiation: Wet vs. Dry Drowning**

| Feature | Wet Drowning (Typical) | Dry Drowning (Atypical) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mechanism** | Aspiration of fluid into lungs | Laryngeal spasm blocks fluid |
| **Froth** | Copious, fine, white, lathery | Absent or very scanty |
| **Lungs** | Voluminous, heavy, water-logged, [[emphysema aquosum]] | Congested but not heavy/water-logged |
| **Diatoms** | Positive in bone marrow/organs | Negative |
| **Cause of Death** | Asphyxia + Electrolyte changes | Asphyxia (pure) |

### **Medicolegal Aspects**
*   **Diagnosis of Exclusion:** It is difficult to prove at postmortem. Diagnosis is made when a body is recovered from water, signs of asphyxia are present, but typical signs of drowning (water in lungs, diatoms) are absent, and other causes are ruled out.
*   **Manner:** Usually **accidental**. Rarely suicidal or homicidal.
*   **Negative Autopsy:** Dry drowning is a known cause of a [[negative autopsy]] (where gross findings are minimal).

### **Mnemonic**

**DRY** Drowning:
*   **D**o not find water in lungs.
*   **R**eflex laryngeal spasm (cause).
*   **Y**ields negative Diatom/Gettler tests.
