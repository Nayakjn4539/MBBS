# Common Peroneal Nerve Injury

[[Common peroneal nerve]] (CPN), also known as the [[lateral popliteal nerve]], is the smaller of the two terminal branches of the [[sciatic nerve]]. It is the most frequently injured nerve in the lower limb due to its superficial course around the neck of the [[fibula]].

### Anatomical Basis
The [[sciatic nerve]] divides into the [[tibial nerve]] and the [[common peroneal nerve]] at the apex of the [[popliteal fossa]] (or higher).
*   **Course:** The CPN runs along the medial border of the [[biceps femoris]], leaves the popliteal fossa at the lateral angle, passes behind the head of the fibula, and winds around the **neck of the fibula**.
*   **Division:** Deep to the [[peroneus longus]] muscle, it divides into two terminal branches:
    1.  **[[Superficial peroneal nerve]] (Musculocutaneous):** Supplies the Lateral compartment of the leg.
    2.  **[[Deep peroneal nerve]] (Anterior Tibial):** Supplies the Anterior compartment of the leg.

### Etiology
The nerve is vulnerable at the **neck of the fibula** where it is subcutaneous and rests against the bone.

| Category | Causes |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Trauma** | • [[Fracture neck of fibula]]<br>• [[Knee dislocation]] (especially varus strain)<br>• Adduction injury to the knee<br>• Gunshot wounds/Lacerations |
| **Compression** | • Tight [[plaster casts]] (below knee)<br>• Tight bandages or stockings<br>• Sleeping in abnormal positions<br>• Prolonged crossed-leg sitting (equivalent to "Saturday Night Palsy" of the leg) |
| **Iatrogenic** | • [[High tibial osteotomy]]<br>• Positioning during surgery (Lithotomy position)<br>• [[Total knee arthroplasty]] |
| **Systemic** | • **[[Leprosy]]** (Commonest general cause)<br>• [[Diabetic neuropathy]]<br>• [[Polyarteritis nodosa]] |
| **Others** | • [[Ganglion]] arising from the superior tibiofibular joint<br>• [[Exostosis]] at the fibular neck |

### Clinical Features
The clinical presentation depends on whether the injury affects the common trunk, the deep branch, or the superficial branch. A complete lesion of the CPN results in **[[Foot Drop]]**.

#### 1. Motor Loss
*   **Paralysis of Dorsiflexors:** Inability to dorsiflex the ankle and toes (Tibialis anterior, EHL, EDL).
*   **Paralysis of Evertors:** Inability to evert the foot (Peroneus longus and brevis).
*   **Resultant Deformity:** The foot hangs in **[[Plantarflexion]]** and **[[Inversion]]** (Equinovarus) due to the unopposed action of the plantar flexors and invertors (supplied by the Tibial nerve).

#### 2. Sensory Loss
Loss of sensation occurs over the distribution area:
*   **Anterolateral aspect of the leg** and **dorsum of the foot** (Superficial peroneal nerve).
*   **First dorsal [[web space]]** (Deep peroneal nerve),.

#### 3. Gait Abnormalities
*   **[[High stepping gait]]**: To clear the ground during the swing phase, the patient flexes the hip and knee excessively because the foot cannot dorsiflex (drop foot),.
*   **Slapping gait:** The foot slaps the ground on heel strike.

#### 4. Autonomic Changes
*   Loss of sweating and vasomotor control in the autonomous zone.
*   Trophic changes (ulcers) may occur in long-standing cases, especially in leprosy.

### Clinical Assessment
*   **Look:** Wasting of the anterior and lateral compartments of the leg. Equinovarus attitude.
*   **Move:** Ask the patient to dorsiflex the ankle and big toe (Deep peroneal) and evert the foot (Superficial peroneal).
*   **Tinel’s Sign:** Tapping the nerve at the neck of the fibula may produce tingling distally, indicating nerve irritability or regeneration.

### Differential Diagnosis
It is crucial to distinguish CPN injury from other causes of foot drop:
1.  **L4/L5 [[Radiculopathy]] (Sciatica):** Usually associated with back pain, positive SLRT, and involvement of Tibialis Posterior (Inversion is weak in L5 lesion, but spared in CPN lesion).
2.  **[[Sciatic Nerve Injury]]:** Paralysis of hamstrings and all muscles below the knee.
3.  **[[Anterior Compartment Syndrome]]:** Severe pain, tense swelling, pain on passive stretch.

### Investigations
1.  **[[X-rays]]:** To rule out fractures of the fibular neck or bony exostosis.
2.  **[[Electrodiagnostic studies]] (NCV/EMG):** 
    *   Confirms the diagnosis and localizes the site of lesion.
    *   Determines if the lesion is complete or incomplete.
    *   Detects signs of re-innervation.
3.  **[[MRI]]:** To visualize soft tissue masses (ganglion) or nerve continuity in trauma.

### Management

#### Conservative Management
Indicated for closed injuries (neuropraxia/axonotmesis) or partial lesions.
*   **Splinting:**
    *   **[[Foot drop splint]]** (static or dynamic): Keeps the ankle at 90 degrees to prevent equinus contracture,.
    *   **[[Ankle-Foot Orthosis]] (AFO):** Helps in ambulation.
    *   **Toe-raising spring**: Attached to shoes for walking.
*   **Physiotherapy:** Galvanic stimulation to maintain muscle tone and passive movements to prevent joint stiffness.
*   **Observation:** Wait for spontaneous recovery (up to 1 year).

#### Operative Management
**Indications:**
*   Open injuries with nerve transection.
*   Failure of conservative treatment (no recovery signs on EMG after 3 months).
*   Intractable pain or compressive lesions (ganglion/callus).

**Procedures:**
1.  **Nerve Repair:** Direct neurorrhaphy or nerve grafting (sural nerve graft) if there is a gap.
2.  **Nerve Decompression/Neurolysis:** For entrapment neuropathies or leprosy.
3.  **[[Tendon Transfer]]:** Indicated for irreversible nerve damage.
    *   **Procedure:** Transfer of **[[Tibialis Posterior]]** tendon to the dorsum of the foot (to the middle cuneiform or cuboid) to act as a dorsiflexor,.
    *   Alternative: Tibialis anterior transposition.
4.  **[[Triple Arthrodesis]]:** For fixed deformities or failed tendon transfers (stabilizes the foot).

### Clinical Implications
*   **Cast Application:** Great care must be taken while applying a below-knee plaster cast. The fibular neck must be well-padded to avoid iatrogenic CPN palsy.
*   **Hip Surgery:** Sciatic nerve injury during hip arthroplasty often manifests predominantly as a peroneal division deficit.

### Mnemonic
**D**rop **F**oot? Check **P**eroneal!
*   **P**eroneal
*   **E**verts and
*   **D**orsiflexes
*(Therefore, injury leads to Inversion and Plantarflexion).*
