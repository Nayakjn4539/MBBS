### [[Jackson’s Cross Cylinder]] (JCC)

**[[Jackson’s Cross Cylinder]]** is a handheld diagnostic instrument used during **subjective [[refraction]]** to refine the axis and power of the cylindrical correction for [[astigmatism]]. It relies on the principle of creating a mixed astigmatic interval to determine which cylindrical correction provides the clearest vision.

#### 1. Construction and Optics
*   **Definition**: It is a combination of two cylindrical lenses of equal strength but opposite signs (+ and -), placed with their axes at right angles (90°) to each other.
*   **Handle Position**: The handle is mounted at **45°** to the axes of the two cylinders.
*   **Net Power Calculation**:
    *   A standard JCC (e.g., ±0.25 D) creates a net effect of +0.25 D cylinder in one meridian and -0.25 D cylinder in the perpendicular meridian.
    *   Optically, this is equivalent to a **+0.25 D Sphere combined with a -0.50 D Cylinder**.
*   **Common Powers**: Available in ±0.12 D, ±0.25 D, ±0.50 D, and ±1.00 D. The ±0.25 D and ±0.50 D are most commonly used in clinical practice.
*   **Identification**:
    *   **Red dots/marks**: Indicate the axis of the **Minus** cylinder power.
    *   **White (or Black) dots/marks**: Indicate the axis of the **Plus** cylinder power.

#### 2. Principle of Action
*   The JCC creates a **Sturm’s Conoid** in the patient's eye.
*   **Goal**: The test is performed with the **[[Circle of Least Diffusion]]** placed on the retina.
*   When "flipped" (twirled), the astigmatic interval is instantaneously reversed. The patient compares the clarity of the target between position 1 and position 2. If the axis or power is incorrect, the circle of least diffusion will not be circular, and one flip position will appear clearer than the other.

#### 3. Clinical Uses
The JCC is primarily used for the **refinement of [[refraction]]** after the initial objective refraction (e.g., [[retinoscopy]]) is completed.
1.  **Verification of the Axis** of the cylinder.
2.  **Verification of the Power (Strength)** of the cylinder.
3.  **Determination of Astigmatism** when none was found objectively (checking for small cylinders).

#### 4. Procedure for Refinement
The [[Subjective Refraction]] using JCC is done in a specific order: **Axis first, then Power**.

**Prerequisite**: The patient must have the "best sphere" correction in place, ensuring the [[circle of least diffusion]] is on the retina.

| Feature | **Refining the Axis** | **Refining the Power** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Handle Position** | Aligned **parallel** to the axis of the trial cylinder. | Aligned at **45°** to the axis of the trial cylinder. |
| **Lens Position** | The axes of the JCC (Red/White dots) are **45°** from the trial axis. | The axes of the JCC (Red/White dots) are **parallel/perpendicular** to the trial axis. |
| **Action** | "Flip" the JCC. The patient compares clarity between Position 1 and 2. | "Flip" the JCC. The patient compares clarity between Position 1 and 2. |
| **Adjustment** | Rotate the trial cylinder axis **towards the preferred color** (e.g., if patient prefers the position where Red dots are, rotate trial axis towards Red). | **Add or subtract power** based on preference. <br>• If **Red** dots align with trial axis and vision improves: **Add Minus** cyl. <br>• If **White** dots align with trial axis and vision improves: **Add Plus** (or reduce minus) cyl. |
| **Endpoint** | Patient reports equal blur/clarity in both flip positions. | Patient reports equal blur/clarity in both flip positions. |

**Correction Rule during Power Refinement**:
To maintain the **[[Spherical Equivalent]]**, for every **0.50 D change in cylinder** power, the **spherical power** should be adjusted by **0.25 D** in the opposite direction.
*   *Example*: If you increase the minus cylinder by -0.50 D, add +0.25 D to the sphere.

#### 5. Checking for Absence of Astigmatism
If retinoscopy shows no astigmatism (simple sphere), the JCC can verify this:
*   Place the JCC at **90°, 180°, 45°, and 135°**.
*   Flip at each position.
*   If the patient reports no difference in clarity at all positions, the absence of astigmatism is confirmed.
*   If a preference is noted, a cylindrical correction is introduced at that axis and refined.

#### 6. Important Mnemonics and Rules

*   **"Chase the Red"**: When refining the axis using minus cylinder refraction, always rotate the axis of the trial lens **towards** the position of the **Red dots** on the JCC when the patient reports better vision.
*   **Verification Sequence**: Always refine **Axis** before **Power**. (Changing the axis changes the effective power in the original meridian less than changing the power itself, but an incorrect axis makes power determination impossible).
