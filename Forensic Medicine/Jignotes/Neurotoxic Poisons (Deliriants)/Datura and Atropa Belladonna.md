# [[Neurotoxic Poisons (Deliriants)]] > Datura and Atropa Belladonna

### Datura and Atropa Belladonna

These plants belong to the family *Solanaceae* and are classified as **Neurotoxic Cerebral Deliriant Poisons**. They primarily act on the central nervous system, producing delirium and hallucinations.

### I. Datura (Thorn Apple)

Datura grows wildly in wastelands. Two common species are *Datura fastuosa* (purple flowers, black seeds) and *Datura alba* (white flowers, yellowish-brown seeds).

#### 1. Active Principles (Alkaloids)
All parts of the plant are poisonous, but the **seeds** and **fruit** are the most toxic.
*   [[Hyoscine]] (Scopolamine): Principal active alkaloid.
*   [[Hyoscyamine]]
*   [[Atropine]] (Traces)

#### 2. Mechanism of Action
*   **Anticholinergic Action:** These alkaloids competitively inhibit the muscarinic effects of [[Acetylcholine]] at the postganglionic parasympathetic nerve endings.
*   **CNS Effect:** Initially stimulates the CNS (causing delirium/excitement) followed by depression and paralysis of the medullary centers (respiratory failure).

#### 3. Clinical Features (Signs and Symptoms)
The symptoms appear rapidly (within half an hour). They constitute the classic **Anticholinergic Toxidrome**.

**A. The Classic Mnemonic:**
> *"Blind as a bat, Hot as a hare, Dry as a bone, Red as a beet, Mad as a wet hen."*

**B. The 9 D's of Datura Poisoning:**
1.  **Dryness** of mouth and throat (intense thirst).
2.  **Dysphagia** (difficulty in swallowing).
3.  **Dilated pupils** (Mydriasis) with loss of light reflex.
4.  **Diplopia** (double vision).
5.  **Dry, hot skin** (abolition of sweating -> Hyperpyrexia).
6.  **Drunken gait** (ataxia/staggering).
7.  **Delirium** (muttering, visual and auditory hallucinations).
8.  **Drowsiness** (follows excitement).
9.  **Death** (due to respiratory failure).

**C. Specific Behaviors:**
*   **Carphologia:** Picking at bedclothes or imaginary threads from fingertips.
*   **Threadng imaginary needles.**
*   **Urinary retention.**

#### 4. Fatal Dose and Period
*   **Fatal Dose:**
    *   ~ 100 to 125 Seeds.
    *   ~ 0.6 to 1 gram of alkaloids.
*   **Fatal Period:** 24 hours.

#### 5. Diagnosis: Identification of Seeds
Datura seeds are often confused with **Chilli (Capsicum)** seeds. Differentiation is a common practical exam question.

| Feature | [[Datura Seeds]] | [[Capsicum Seeds]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Size** | Larger and thicker | Smaller and thinner |
| **Shape** | Kidney-shaped (Reniform) | Round or Oval |
| **Color** | Dark brown / Yellowish-brown | Pale yellow |
| **Surface** | Pitted / Rough | Smooth |
| **Border** | Double-edged (distinct ridge) | Single sharp edge |
| **Smell** | Odorless (bitter taste) | Pungent smell & taste |
| **Section** | Embryo curves **outwards** | Embryo curves **inwards** |
| **On Heating** | Does not puff up | Puffs up with irritating fumes |

#### 6. Treatment
1.  **Gastric Lavage:** With weak **Potassium Permanganate (1:5000)** or 4-5% tannic acid to precipitate alkaloids. This is crucial even if the patient is seen late.
2.  **Specific Antidote:** [[Physostigmine]] (1-2 mg IV or IM). It crosses the blood-brain barrier and reverses both central and peripheral effects. Repeat every 30-60 mins if needed.
    *   *Note:* **Neostigmine** and **Pilocarpine** are *not* true antidotes as they do not cross the blood-brain barrier; they only relieve peripheral symptoms (like dry mouth).
3.  **Symptomatic:**
    *   **Diazepam** or short-acting barbiturates for delirium/convulsions.
    *   Cold sponging for hyperpyrexia.
    *   Catheterization for urinary retention.
    *   Dark room to prevent photophobia.

#### 7. Postmortem Findings
*   **Specific:** Seeds or fruit fragments may be found in the stomach (they resist putrefaction).
*   **General:** Signs of asphyxia, congestion of internal organs.
*   **Chemical Analysis:** Mydriatic test (instilling stomach extract into a cat's eye causes dilation).

#### 8. Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Stupefying Agent:** Most common use. Mixed with food/drink (prasad, tea, liquor) to rob travelers. Known as **"Road Poison"** or **"Railway Poison"**.
*   **Accidental:** Children eating the fruit (mistaking for edible fruit) or seeds.
*   **Aphrodisiac:** Used by quacks; overdose leads to death.
*   **Kidnapping:** To incapacitate the victim.

### II. Atropa Belladonna (Deadly Nightshade)

#### 1. General Features
*   The plant is known as "Deadly Nightshade."
*   All parts are poisonous, especially the **roots**, leaves, and **berries**.
*   Berries are globular, black/purple, and sweet (attractive to children).

#### 2. Active Principles
*   [[Atropine]] (Main alkaloid)
*   Hyoscyamine
*   Hyoscine (Scopolamine)

#### 3. Clinical Features
*   Symptoms are identical to Datura poisoning (**Anticholinergic toxidrome**).
*   Additional sign: A **scarlatiniform rash** may appear on the skin.

#### 4. Fatal Dose
*   **Atropine:** 100 - 120 mg.
*   **Berries:** 10 - 20 berries.

#### 5. Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Accidental:** Children eating berries mistaking them for fruit.
*   **Iatrogenic:** Overdose of atropine drops or injections (e.g., in OPC poisoning treatment).
*   **Historical:** "Belladonna" means beautiful lady; juice was used historically to dilate pupils for cosmetic purposes.
