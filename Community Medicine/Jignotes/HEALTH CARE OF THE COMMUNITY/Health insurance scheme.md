### **Comparison: ESI vs. CGHS**

| Feature | [[Employees State Insurance]] (ESI) | [[Central Government Health Scheme]] (CGHS) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Applicability** | Industrial workers/Factories/Estt. | Central Govt. Employees/Pensioners |
| **Coverage** | Includes cash benefits & medical care | primarily comprehensive medical care |
| **Wage Limit** | Up to ₹ 21,000/month | No limit (Applicable to all pay grades) |
| **Funding** | Employee + Employer + State Govt | Employee Contribution + Central Govt |
| **Administration**| ESI Corporation (Autonomous) | Directorate General of Health Services (Ministry of Health) |

---

### **Clinical Relevance**
*   **Patient Status:** Doctors must ascertain if a patient is an ESI/CGHS/PMJAY beneficiary to follow specific referral protocols and ensure cashless treatment.
*   **Certification:** ESI doctors have statutory powers to issue sickness certificates which legally entitle workers to paid leave; identifying malingering is a key responsibility.
*   **Documentation:** Accurate documentation of employment injuries is crucial for patients claiming Disablement Benefits.
