# [[Identification]] > DNA Profiling and Fingerprinting

### DNA Profiling (DNA Fingerprinting)

**DNA Profiling**, also known as **DNA Typing** or **Genetic Fingerprinting**, is the most reliable method of identification, capable of distinguishing every individual with the exception of [[monozygotic twins]]. It was developed by **Sir Alec Jeffreys** in 1985.

### Biological Basis
*   **Human Genome:** Contains about 30,000–35,000 genes. 99.9% of the DNA sequence is identical in all humans.
*   **Polymorphism:** The remaining 0.1% varies significantly between individuals. This variation is found in the non-coding regions (introns) often called **"Junk DNA"**.
*   **VNTRs (Variable Number Tandem Repeats):** Short sequences of bases (e.g., GCTA) repeat themselves like a stutter. These hypervariable regions are called **Minisatellites** or [[Satellite DNA]]. The number of repeats varies between individuals, forming the basis of identification.

### Techniques of DNA Typing

| Technique | Description | Advantages/Disadvantages |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RFLP** (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) | The classic method. Uses restriction enzymes to cut DNA at specific sites. | **High specificity** but requires large amounts of high-quality (non-degraded) DNA. |
| **PCR** (Polymerase Chain Reaction) | "Molecular photocopying." Amplifies specific regions of DNA. | Extremely **sensitive**; can analyze minute or degraded samples (e.g., single hair root). Faster than RFLP. |
| **STR** (Short Tandem Repeats) | Analysis of microsatellites (2-7 base pairs). Current standard (e.g., CODIS uses 13 loci). | Highly discriminating. Suitable for multiplexing and automated analysis. |
| **mtDNA** ([[Mitochondrial DNA]]) | Inherited only from the **mother**. Found in cytoplasm. | Used when nuclear DNA is absent (e.g., **hair shafts**, old bones). Less discriminatory (all maternal relatives match). |
| **Y-STR** | Specific to Y-chromosome. | Useful in **sexual assault** cases (mixed male/female samples) to isolate male DNA. |

### Sample Collection and Preservation

**Sources of DNA:**
*   **Living Subjects:** Liquid [[blood]] (most common), **buccal swabs** (easiest/non-invasive), hair (plucked with root).
*   **Dead/Decomposed:** [[Teeth]] (pulp is protected), long bones (femur), deep muscle, hair roots.
*   **Crime Scene:** Semen stains, saliva (cigarette butts, stamps), skin cells (fingernail scrapings), blood spatters.

**Preservation Methods:**
1.  **Liquid Blood:** Collected in **EDTA** (purple top) or **sodium fluoride**. **Heparin** should NOT be used (interferes with PCR).
2.  **Dry Stains:** Air-dried at room temperature; stored in paper envelopes (plastic causes mold).
3.  **Temperature:**
    *   Short term: 4°C (Refrigeration).
    *   Long term: -20°C or -70°C (Deep freeze).
4.  **FTA Cards:** Specially treated paper that protects DNA at room temperature for years. Cells lyse on contact, and DNA is immobilized.
5.  **Fixatives:** **Never use Formalin** for tissues intended for DNA analysis as it degrades DNA. Use 70% alcohol if necessary.

### Procedure (RFLP Method)
The process typically takes weeks (unlike the rapid PCR/STR methods).

**Steps:**
1.  **Isolation/Extraction:** DNA is recovered from cells.
2.  **Restriction Digestion:** DNA is cut into fragments by **Restriction Endonucleases** (molecular scissors).
3.  **Gel Electrophoresis:** Fragments are separated by size on an agarose gel using electric current (smaller fragments move faster).
4.  **Southern Blotting:** DNA is transferred (blotted) from the delicate gel to a robust nylon membrane.
5.  **Hybridization:** Radioactive **DNA Probes** bind to specific complementary VNTR sequences.
6.  **Autoradiography:** X-ray film is placed over the membrane. The radioactive probes create dark bands on the film, looking like a barcode.

### Medico-Legal Applications

1.  **Paternity/Maternity Disputes:**
    *   A child inherits one allele from the mother and one from the father for every locus.
    *   **Exclusion:** If the child possesses bands not present in either parent, parentage is excluded (100% certainty).
    *   **Inclusion:** If bands match, probability of paternity is calculated (usually >99.9%).
2.  **Criminal Identification:**
    *   Matching suspect's DNA with evidence (semen/blood) from the crime scene (e.g., [[Rape]], Murder).
    *   Exonerating the innocent (e.g., The **Colin Pitchfork** case - first use of DNA to solve a crime and exonerate a suspect).
3.  **Identification of Remains:**
    *   Mass disasters (plane crashes, explosions).
    *   Mutilated or decomposed bodies where facial recognition/fingerprints fail.
4.  **Immigration:** Proving biological relationships for visa purposes.

### Limitations and Fallacies
*   **Identical Twins:** Cannot be distinguished by standard DNA profiling (they are clones).
*   **Chimera:** A person with two different cell lines (e.g., after bone marrow transplant) may have different DNA profiles in blood vs. buccal cells.
*   **Contamination:** The biggest risk. Tiny amounts of foreign DNA can ruin PCR results.
*   **Chain of Custody:** If the chain is broken, the evidence is inadmissible in court regardless of the science.

### Medico-Legal Aspects
*   **Consent:** Informed consent is required for collecting samples from living individuals (victim or accused). In India, under **CrPC Section 53**, force can be used to take samples from an accused upon request of a police officer (not below Sub-Inspector) if there are reasonable grounds.
*   **Admissibility:** Courts generally accept DNA evidence, but the statistical probability (Random Match Probability) must be interpreted carefully to avoid the **Prosecutor's Fallacy**.
