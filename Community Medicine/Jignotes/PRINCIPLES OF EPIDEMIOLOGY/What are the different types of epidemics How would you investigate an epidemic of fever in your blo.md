# [[PRINCIPLES OF EPIDEMIOLOGY]] > What are the different types of epidemics? How would you investigate an epidemic of fever in your block?

### **Types of Epidemics**

Epidemics are broadly classified into three major types based on their mode of spread and exposure duration.

**1. [[Common-Source Epidemics]]**
In these epidemics, the population is exposed to an infectious agent or toxin from the same source (e.g., water, food, or gas).

*   **A. Single Exposure or "Point-Source" Epidemics:**
    *   Exposure is brief and simultaneous,.
    *   **Key Feature:** All cases develop within **one incubation period** of the disease.
    *   **Epidemic Curve:** Rises and falls rapidly; explosive nature with **no secondary waves**,.
    *   *Examples:* Food poisoning, [[Bhopal Gas Tragedy]] (industrial pollution), [[Cholera]] outbreak from a specific water pump,.

*   **B. Continuous or Multiple Exposure Epidemics:**
    *   Exposure to the source is prolonged, repeated, or intermittent.
    *   **Key Feature:** The outbreak continues beyond one incubation period.
    *   **Epidemic Curve:** Sharp rise but the fall is interrupted by **secondary waves** or peaks; the decline is not as rapid as point-source epidemics.
    *   *Examples:* A contaminated well used over weeks, a prostitute in a [[gonorrhea]] outbreak infecting clients over time, or [[Legionnaire's disease]] in Philadelphia,.

**2. [[Propagated Epidemics]]**
*   These result from person-to-person transmission, arthropod vectors, or animal reservoirs,.
*   **Key Feature:** Transmission continues until the number of susceptible individuals is depleted or susceptible people are no longer exposed to infected persons.
*   **Epidemic Curve:** Gradual rise and gradual fall (tails off over a long period).
*   *Examples:* [[Measles]], [[HIV]], Tuberculosis, Hepatitis A,.

**3. Slow (Modern) Epidemics**
*   These refer to non-communicable diseases, lifestyle diseases, or conditions that increase progressively over a long period.
*   *Examples:* [[Diabetes]], [[Cancer]], Cardiovascular diseases.

### **Investigation of an Epidemic of Fever**

As a medical officer in charge of a block, investigating an epidemic of [[fever]] requires a systematic, orderly procedure. The objectives are to define the magnitude, identify the cause/source, and control the spread,.

**Step 1: [[Verification of Diagnosis]]**
*   Do not rely solely on rumors; verify the report on the spot as quickly as possible.
*   It is **not necessary to examine all cases**; a clinical examination of a sample of cases is sufficient.
*   Laboratory investigations (e.g., blood smears for malaria, serology for dengue) are useful but epidemiological investigation should **not** be delayed waiting for lab results,.

**Step 2: [[Confirmation of the Existence of an Epidemic]]**
*   Compare the observed frequency of fever cases with the expected frequency for the same population during the same period in previous years.
*   An epidemic exists if the number of cases is **"clearly in excess of normal expectancy"**.
*   *Statistical Threshold:* Often defined as exceeding **two standard errors** from the endemic occurrence.

**Step 3: Defining the [[Population at Risk]]**
*   Obtain or prepare a detailed map of the area (block/village).
*   Identify landmarks, roads, and dwelling units to demarcate the affected area.
*   Calculate the appropriate denominator (population at risk) for attack rates.

**Step 4: Rapid Search for All Cases**
*   Conduct a **medical survey** to identify all affected individuals, including those who haven't sought medical care.
*   Use a designed **Epidemiological Case Sheet** to collect data: Name, age, sex, occupation, time of onset, signs/symptoms, and history of exposure (e.g., mosquito bites, water sources, travel).
*   Search for **secondary cases** daily until the area is declared free of the epidemic (usually twice the incubation period since the last case),.

**Step 5: [[Data Analysis]]**
Analyze data by **Time, Place, and Person**.
*   **Time:** Construct an **Epidemic Curve** (chronological distribution of onset dates) to identify the type of epidemic (common source vs. propagated).
*   **Place:** Prepare a **[[Spot Map]]** to look for clustering of cases (e.g., near a water pump or breeding site).
*   **Person:** Analyze attack rates by age, sex, and occupation to identify high-risk groups.

**Step 6: Formulation of Hypothesis**
*   Based on the analysis, formulate a hypothesis regarding:
    *   Possible source (e.g., water, mosquitoes).
    *   Causative agent (e.g., *Plasmodium*, *Dengue virus*).
    *   Mode of transmission (e.g., vector-borne, water-borne).
    *   Environmental factors.

**Step 7: Testing of Hypothesis**
*   Compare attack rates in those exposed to the suspected factor vs. those not exposed to ensure the hypothesis is consistent with facts.

**Step 8: Evaluation of [[Ecological Factors]]**
*   Investigate environmental conditions enabling the outbreak, such as vector density (mosquitoes), sanitary status, water supply breakdown, or atmospheric changes.

**Step 9: Further Investigation of Population at Risk**
*   This may involve medical examination, screening tests (e.g., mass blood survey), or examination of suspected vectors/water samples to confirm the agent.

**Step 10: Writing the Report**
*   Prepare a comprehensive report covering background, historical data, methodology, analysis, control measures implemented, and evaluation.
