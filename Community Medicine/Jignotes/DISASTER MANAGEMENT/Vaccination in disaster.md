# [[DISASTER MANAGEMENT]] > Vaccination in disaster

### General Principles of Vaccination in Disasters

Contrary to popular belief and public/media pressure, **mass vaccination** is usually **not recommended** immediately following natural disasters. The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes that the primary focus should be on supplying **safe drinking water** and ensuring **proper disposal of excreta**.

**Principles regarding mass vaccination:**
*   It should not be undertaken without a specific indication.
*   It may divert limited manpower and resources from more critical relief work.
*   It may create a **false sense of security**, leading to neglect of hygiene and sanitation.
*   Supervision of sterilization and injection safety might be compromised in chaotic settings.

### Recommendations for Specific Diseases

#### 1. [[Typhoid]] and [[Cholera]]
*   **Recommendation:** WHO **does not recommend** the routine use of typhoid and cholera vaccines in endemic areas after a disaster.
*   **Reasons:**
    *   Newer vaccines have increased efficacy but require multiple doses (compliance issues).
    *   They have not yet been proven effective as a large-scale public health measure in disaster settings.
    *   **Best Strategy:** Sanitation and Safe Water supply.

#### 2. [[Tetanus]]
*   **Recommendation:** Mass vaccination of the general population is **usually unnecessary** as significant increases in tetanus incidence do not typically occur after natural disasters.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Primary Prevention:** Maintenance of high immunity levels through routine immunization *before* the disaster.
    *   **Wounded patients:** Adequate wound cleaning and surgical toilet are paramount.
    *   **Booster:** If the last dose was >5 years ago, a [[Tetanus Toxoid]] (TT) booster is effective.
    *   **Unimmunized injured:** Tetanus Toxoid + Tetanus Immunoglobulin (TIG) at the discretion of the physician.

#### 3. [[Measles]]
*   **Recommendation:** This is the **highest priority** vaccination for children living in congregate care (camps/shelters) after a disaster.
*   **Reason:** Measles can spread rapidly in overcrowded camps and depletes [[Vitamin A]] stores in children, increasing mortality.
*   **Action:** Immediate vaccination campaigns for children (usually 9 months to 15 years) along with Vitamin A supplementation.

#### 4. [[Orthopaedics/Jignotes/Pediatric Orthopaedics/Poliomyelitis]]
*   Disasters may disrupt ongoing eradication programs.
*   If cold-chain facilities are inadequate, they must be requested alongside vaccines.
*   Routine immunization programs should be re-established as soon as possible in relief camps.

### Vaccination for Health Care Workers (HCWs) and Relief Teams

Personnel working in disaster relief are at higher risk and should be protected.
*   **Recommended Vaccines:** [[Hepatitis B]] and Tetanus.
*   **Outbreak Specific:** Vaccines for specific outbreaks (e.g., Cholera or Yellow Fever) if indicated by epidemiological data.

### Vaccination in Biological Disasters (Bioterrorism)

In the event of a biological disaster (e.g., Anthrax, Smallpox), emergency immunization plans differ:

| Disease | Passive Immunization / Prophylaxis | Active Immunization |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Botulism]]** | Trivalent botulinal antitoxin (types A, B, E). Check for horse serum sensitivity. | Not applicable in acute phase. |
| **[[Anthrax]]** | Antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin/Doxycycline). | Anthrax vaccine (for at-risk groups/troops). |
| **[[Smallpox]]** | Vaccinia Immune Globulin (VIG). | Smallpox vaccine (Ring vaccination strategy). |
| **[[Rabies]]** | Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG) locally + IM. | Anti-rabies vaccine (Post-exposure prophylaxis). |
| **[[Hepatitis A]]** | Human IG (for contacts within 2 weeks). | Hep A vaccine (if available/indicated). |

### Summary Table: Vaccination Strategy in Natural Disasters

| Disease | Mass Vaccination Recommended? | Reasoning/Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Typhoid** | **NO** | Low efficacy, multiple doses needed. Hygiene is better. |
| **Cholera** | **NO** | False sense of security. Focus on water safety. |
| **Tetanus** | **NO** | Focus on wound care. Boosters only for the injured. |
| **Measles** | **YES** | **Top Priority** in camps due to overcrowding. |
| **Polio** | **YES** (Routine) | Continue routine immunization to prevent gaps. |

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Vitamin A & Measles:** In disaster camps, if a child gets measles, the risk of blindness (Xerophthalmia) and death increases significantly. Therefore, **Vitamin A supplementation** is mandatory alongside measles vaccination.
*   **[[Cold Chain]] Failure:** In disasters, electricity is often disrupted. Use **Vaccine Vial Monitors (VVM)** strictly to assess potency before administration.

### Mnemonic
To remember diseases where mass vaccination is **NOT** recommended immediately in natural disasters:
**"Don't T.C.T."**
*   **T** - Typhoid
*   **C** - Cholera
*   **T** - Tetanus (General mass vax)
