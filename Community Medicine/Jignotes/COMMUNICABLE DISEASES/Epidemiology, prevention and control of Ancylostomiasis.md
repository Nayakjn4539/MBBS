# Epidemiology, Prevention, and Control of Ancylostomiasis

**Ancylostomiasis**, commonly known as **Hookworm infection**, is a major public health problem in tropical and subtropical countries. It is defined as any infection caused by *Ancylostomiasis duodenale* or *Necator americanus*.

**Synonyms:** Miner’s anaemia, Tunnel disease, Brickmaker’s anaemia, Egyptian chlorosis.

### 1. Epidemiological Determinants

#### A. Agent Factors
*   **Agent:** The two main nematode parasites are:
    1.  ***Ancylostomiasis duodenale***: Prevalent in Europe, South-western Asia, and throughout India.
    2.  ***Necator americanus***: Prevalent in tropical Africa, Americas, and South India.
*   **Habitat:** Adult worms live in the [[small intestine]] (mainly jejunum) attaching to villi.
*   **Life Span:** *A. duodenale* (~1 year) and *N. americanus* (~4 years).
*   **Infective Stage:** Filariform larva.
*   **Reservoir:** **Man** is the only important reservoir of infection.
*   **Infective Material:** Feces containing ova; soil contaminated with infective larvae.

#### B. Host Factors
*   **Age & Sex:** All ages susceptible. In endemic areas, highest incidence is in **15–25 years** age group.
*   **Nutrition:** Malnutrition is a predisposing factor. The disease is chronic and disabling in malnourished individuals with inadequate iron intake.
*   **Occupation:** Higher prevalence in agricultural workers/farming communities due to contact with soil.

#### C. Environmental Factors
*   **Soil:** Damp, **sandy**, or friable soil with decaying vegetation is most favorable. Clay soil is unfavorable.
*   **Temperature:** 24°C to 32°C is optimum for larval survival.
*   **Human Habits:** Indiscriminate [[open defecation]], going barefoot, and using untreated sewage for farming are crucial factors.

### 2. Transmission and Life Cycle

*   **Route of Entry:**
    1.  **Percutaneous (Skin):** Filariform larvae in soil penetrate the skin (usually feet/legs).
    2.  **Oral:** *A. duodenale* can also infect via the oral route (ingestion of contaminated water/vegetables).
*   **No Man-to-Man Transmission:** Fresh feces are not infective. Eggs need a developmental period in the soil (extrinsic incubation).
*   **Incubation Period:**
    *   *N. americanus*: ~7 weeks.
    *   *A. duodenale*: 5 weeks to 9 months.

### 3. Clinical Features and Impact

The primary pathology is chronic blood loss leading to **Iron Deficiency Anaemia**.

*   **Individual Impact:**
    *   **Anaemia:** Hypochromic microcytic anemia.
    *   **Hypoalbuminemia:** Due to plasma loss.
    *   **Growth Retardation:** Physical and cognitive impairment in children.
    *   **Blood Loss estimation:**
        *   *N. americanus*: 0.03 ml/worm/day.
        *   *A. duodenale*: 0.2 ml/worm/day.
*   **Community Impact:** Reduces work productivity and increases maternal/child morbidity.

> **Clinical Relevance:** *Cutaneous larva migrans* (creeping eruption) is a skin disease caused by larvae of animal hookworms (e.g., *A. braziliense*) penetrating human skin.

### 4. Assessment of Burden: [[Chandler's Index]]

This is the standard epidemiological index to measure the intensity of hookworm infection in a community. It is the average number of hookworm eggs per gram of feces for the entire community.

| Average eggs/gram of stool | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **< 200** | Not significant |
| **200 – 250** | Potential danger |
| **250 – 300** | Minor public health problem |
| **> 300** | **Important public health problem** |

### 5. Prevention and Control Strategies

Control requires a multi-pronged approach involving sanitation, chemotherapy, and health education.

#### A. Sanitation (Primary Prevention)
*   **Sanitary Disposal of Excreta:** Installation of sewage systems or sanitary latrines to prevent soil pollution.
*   **Prevention of Soil Pollution:** Stopping open defecation is the only long-term solution.

#### B. Personal Prophylaxis
*   **Protective Footwear:** Wearing shoes prevents skin penetration by larvae.
*   **Hygiene:** Washing hands before eating and after defecation.

#### C. Chemotherapy (Secondary Prevention)
Periodic case finding and treatment reduce the worm burden and transmission.

*   **Drug of Choice:**
    *   **[[Albendazole]]**: 400 mg single dose (for all ages > 2 years).
    *   **Mebendazole**: 100 mg twice daily for 3 days or 500 mg single dose.
    *   **Pyrantel Pamoate**: 10 mg/kg body weight (single dose).
*   **Preventive Chemotherapy (Mass Drug Administration):** WHO recommends periodic deworming of at-risk populations (preschool/school children, women of childbearing age) without individual diagnosis in endemic areas.
    *   *Frequency:* Once a year if prevalence >20%; Twice a year if prevalence >50%.

#### D. Treatment of Anaemia
*   **Iron and Folic Acid:** Ferrous sulphate (200 mg TDS) to correct anemia.
*   **Diet:** Diet rich in protein and iron.

### 6. Mnemonics

**Mnemonic for Hookworm Features: "HOOK"**
*   **H**eavy blood sucker (*A. duodenale* sucks more than *Necator*).
*   **O**ral route possible (only for *A. duodenale*).
*   **O**ccupational hazard (Farmers/Brickmakers).
*   **K**ill with Albendazole.

**Mnemonic for Chandler's Index: "300 Spartans"**
*   Like the 300 Spartans were important warriors, **>300** eggs/gm is an **Important** public health problem.
