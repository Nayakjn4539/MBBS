# Non-Neoplastic Disorders of Salivary Glands

Salivary gland disorders can be broadly classified into inflammatory, obstructive, autoimmune, and cystic lesions. These conditions primarily affect the major salivary glands: [[Parotid gland]], [[Submandibular gland]], and [[Sublingual gland]].

---

## 1. Inflammatory Disorders (Sialadenitis)

### A. Acute Viral Sialadenitis (Mumps)
*   **Definition:** An acute, contagious, non-suppurative enlargement of one or both [[Parotid gland]]s caused by the **Paramyxovirus**.
*   **Epidemiology:** Most common in children (5–15 years). Spread via droplet infection and saliva.
*   **Incubation Period:** 2–3 weeks.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Fever, malaise, trismus.
    *   Bilateral painful parotid swelling (one side may precede the other).
    *   Congested duct orifice ([[Stensen's duct]]).
    *   Earache (referred otalgia).
*   **Complications:**
    *   **Orchitis** (20–30% in post-pubertal males) causing atrophy/sterility.
    *   **Oophoritis**.
    *   **Pancreatitis**.
    *   **Meningoencephalitis**.
    *   **Sensorineural Hearing Loss** (Usually unilateral, sudden, and permanent).
*   **Treatment:** Symptomatic (analgesics, hydration, rest). It is self-limiting.

> **Clinical Implication:** A child with bilateral parotid swelling should always be isolated to prevent spread. In adults, rule out other causes like [[Sjögren’s syndrome]] or [[Sialadenosis]].

### B. Acute Suppurative Sialadenitis
*   **Etiology:** Bacterial infection, commonly **Staphylococcus aureus**.
*   **Predisposing Factors:**
    *   Dehydration (post-operative patients, elderly).
    *   Debilitated states.
    *   Poor oral hygiene.
    *   Drugs causing [[Xerostomia]] (antihistamines, diuretics).
    *   **Route:** Retrograde infection from the oral cavity via [[Stensen's duct]].
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Sudden onset of severe pain and unilateral swelling of the parotid.
    *   Tender, warm, indurated gland.
    *   **Pus discharge** from the duct orifice upon milking the gland.
    *   Fever and toxemia.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Hydration:** Rehydration is crucial.
    *   **Antibiotics:** IV antibiotics (anti-staphylococcal).
    *   **Sialogogues:** Lemon drops to promote salivary flow.
    *   **Surgical Drainage:** If abscess forms (fluctuation is late due to dense parotid fascia). Incision is made horizontally (Hilton's method) to avoid injury to the [[Facial nerve]].

### C. Chronic Recurrent Sialadenitis
*   **Pathology:** Recurrent episodes of inflammation leading to destruction of acini and stricture formation in ducts.
*   **Etiology:** Stasis of saliva (stones, strictures), recurrent bacterial superinfection.
*   **Clinical Features:** Recurrent unilateral swelling and pain during meals. Gland becomes firm and fibrous over time.
*   **Investigation:** [[Sialography]] shows "sausage string" appearance (strictures and dilatation) or [[Sialectasis]].
*   **Treatment:** Conservative (antibiotics during attacks, sialogogues). [[Parotidectomy]] or gland excision for refractory cases.

## 2. Obstructive Disorders (Sialolithiasis)

Formation of stones (calculi) within the duct or parenchyma of salivary glands.

*   **Location:**
    *   **Submandibular Gland:** 80–90% (Most common).
    *   **Parotid Gland:** 10–20%.
    *   **Sublingual Gland:** Rare (<1%).

### Comparison: Submandibular vs. Parotid Calculi

| Feature | [[Submandibular Gland]] Stone | [[Parotid Gland]] Stone |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Incidence** | Very Common (80–90%) | Less Common |
| **Saliva Consistency** | Thick, Mucinous | Thin, Serous |
| **pH** | Alkaline (favors phosphate precipitation) | Acidic |
| **Calcium Content** | High | Low |
| **Duct Anatomy** | [[Wharton's duct]] is long, tortuous, and flows **against gravity** | [[Stensen's duct]] is shorter, wider, and flows horizontally |
| **Radiopacity** | Usually **Radio-opaque** (80%) | Usually **Radiolucent** |

*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Salivary Colic:** Intermittent pain and swelling of the gland aggravated by eating (mealtime syndrome).
    *   Swelling subsides gradually after meals.
    *   Palpable stone in the floor of the mouth or cheek.
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   **X-ray:** Intraoral occlusal view (for submandibular), lateral oblique view.
    *   **Sialography:** Contraindicated in acute infection. Shows filling defect.
    *   **Ultrasound/CT:** For intraglandular or radiolucent stones.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Intraoral removal:** For stones near the duct orifice (meatotomy).
    *   **Gland Excision:** For intraglandular stones or chronically damaged glands.
    *   **Sialoendoscopy:** Newer minimally invasive technique for stone retrieval.

## 3. Cystic Lesions

### A. Ranula
*   **Definition:** A transparent, bluish, cystic swelling in the floor of the mouth caused by mucous extravasation from the [[Sublingual gland]].
*   **Appearance:** Resembles a frog's belly (Latin *Rana* = Frog).
*   **Types:**
    1.  **Simple Ranula:** Confined to the floor of the mouth, above the [[Mylohyoid muscle]].
    2.  **Plunging Ranula:** Extends through the mylohyoid muscle into the neck (submandibular space). Presents as a neck mass.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Marsupialization:** Unroofing the cyst (high recurrence rate).
    *   **Excision:** Removal of the cyst *along with* the offending sublingual gland (Definitive treatment).

### B. Mucocele
*   **Definition:** Retention cyst of **minor salivary glands**.
*   **Site:** Most common on the **lower lip**.
*   **Cause:** Trauma to the duct (lip biting).
*   **Treatment:** Surgical excision.

## 4. Autoimmune and Chronic Disorders

### A. Sjögren’s Syndrome (Sicca Syndrome)
*   **Definition:** Chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Primary:** [[Xerostomia]] (Dry mouth) + [[Xerophthalmia]] (Dry eyes).
    *   **Secondary:** Primary features + Connective tissue disorder (Rheumatoid arthritis, SLE).
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Dry mouth, difficulty swallowing dry food, dental caries.
    *   Bilateral, diffuse, non-tender enlargement of parotid glands.
    *   Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (gritty sensation in eyes).
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   **Schirmer’s Test:** Reduced tear production.
    *   **Biopsy:** Lower lip biopsy (minor salivary glands) showing lymphocytic infiltration.
    *   **Serology:** Anti-SS-A (Ro) and Anti-SS-B (La) antibodies.
*   **Risk:** Increased risk of **B-cell Lymphoma** (Non-Hodgkin's).

### B. Sialadenosis (Sialosis)
*   **Definition:** Non-inflammatory, non-neoplastic, bilateral, painless enlargement of salivary glands (usually parotid).
*   **Pathology:** Hypertrophy of acinar cells.
*   **Etiology:** Systemic metabolic disorders.
    *   Diabetes Mellitus.
    *   Chronic Alcoholism.
    *   Malnutrition / Bulimia.
    *   Hypothyroidism.
*   **Treatment:** Manage the underlying systemic cause.

### C. Necrotizing Sialometaplasia
*   **Importance:** A benign inflammatory condition that **mimics malignancy** (Squamous cell carcinoma or Mucoepidermoid carcinoma) clinically and histologically.
*   **Site:** Usually the hard palate.
*   **Cause:** Ischemia of minor salivary glands.
*   **Feature:** Deep, non-tender ulcer. Heals spontaneously in 6–10 weeks. Biopsy is crucial to rule out cancer.

## 5. Frey's Syndrome (Gustatory Sweating)

*   **Definition:** Sweating and flushing of the skin over the parotid area during chewing/eating.
*   **Etiology:** Complication of [[Parotidectomy]].
*   **Mechanism:** Aberrant regeneration of nerve fibers. Severed parasympathetic secretomotor fibers (from [[Auriculotemporal nerve]]) misdirect and innervate the sympathetic receptors of the sweat glands in the overlying skin.
*   **Diagnosis:** Starch-Iodine test (turns blue on sweating).
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Usually reassurance.
    *   Topical antiperspirants.
    *   Botulinum toxin injections (Botox) into the affected skin.
    *   Prevention: Interposition of fascia (e.g., SMAS flap) during surgery.
