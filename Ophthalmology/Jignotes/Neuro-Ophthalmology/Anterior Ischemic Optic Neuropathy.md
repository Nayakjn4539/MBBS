# Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (AION)

[[Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy]] (AION) is a segmental or generalized infarction within the prelaminar or laminar portion of the [[optic nerve]] caused by occlusion of the [[short posterior ciliary arteries]] (SPCAs). It represents a form of [[stroke]] affecting the [[optic nerve head]].

It is broadly classified into two distinct clinical entities based on etiology:
1.  **Arteritic AION (AAION):** Associated with [[Giant Cell Arteritis]].
2.  **Non-Arteritic AION (NAION):** Associated with systemic vascular diseases.

### 1. Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION)

This is the most common form of ischemic optic neuropathy, typically affecting the middle-aged and elderly population (mean age ~60 years).

#### Etiopathogenesis
*   **Mechanism:** Infarction of the retrolaminar portion of the optic nerve head due to hypoperfusion of the [[short posterior ciliary arteries]].
*   **"Disc at Risk":** A crucial anatomical predisposing factor. It refers to a small, crowded [[optic disc]] with a small or absent [[physiological cup]]. This structural crowding compromises blood supply when tissue edema occurs.
*   **Systemic Risk Factors:**
    *   [[Hypertension]] (Major risk factor).
    *   [[Diabetes Mellitus]].
    *   [[Hyperlipidemia]].
    *   [[Nocturnal hypotension]] (precipitating factor for morning vision loss).
    *   [[Sleep apnea]].
    *   Smoking.
    *   Use of [[Sildenafil]] (Viagra) due to hypotensive effect.
    *   Post-cataract surgery.

#### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Sudden, painless loss of vision**: Usually monocular.
    *   **Onset:** Often discovered upon waking up in the morning (due to nocturnal hypotension).
    *   No premonitory symptoms (unlike AAION).
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Visual Acuity:** Variable, can range from normal to profound loss.
    *   **Pupils:** [[Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect]] (RAPD) is present.
    *   **Color Vision:** Diminished in proportion to the level of visual acuity (unlike [[optic neuritis]] where color loss is disproportionately severe).
    *   **Visual Fields:** **Altitudinal hemianopia** (usually inferior) is the classic defect.

#### Fundus Findings
*   **Acute Stage:**
    *   **Disc Edema:** Hyperemic (Pink) or pale swelling. Often sectoral (superior disc swelling leading to inferior field defect).
    *   **Hemorrhages:** [[Splinter hemorrhages]] at the disc margin.
    *   **Crowded Disc:** The fellow eye usually shows a "disc at risk" (small cup).
*   **Chronic Stage:**
    *   Disc edema resolves into [[optic atrophy]] (pallor).
    *   May present as **Pseudo-Foster Kennedy Syndrome**: One eye shows optic atrophy (old AION) and the other eye shows disc edema (fresh AION).

### 2. Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (AAION)

This is an ophthalmic emergency caused by [[Giant Cell Arteritis]] (GCA), also known as [[Temporal Arteritis]]. It typically affects elderly patients (>70 years), with a female preponderance.

#### Etiopathogenesis
*   **Pathology:** Granulomatous inflammation of medium and small-sized arteries (vasculitis) leading to thrombotic occlusion of the [[short posterior ciliary arteries]].
*   **Involvement:** Often bilateral if untreated (fellow eye involvement can occur within hours to days).

#### Clinical Features
*   **Systemic Symptoms (GCA):**
    *   **Jaw Claudication:** Pathognomonic sign (pain on chewing due to masseter ischemia).
    *   Scalp tenderness (pain on combing hair).
    *   Temporal artery tenderness or pulselessness.
    *   Malaise, weight loss, fever, night sweats.
    *   [[Polymyalgia Rheumatica]] (joint and muscle pain).
*   **Ocular Symptoms:**
    *   **Amaurosis Fugax:** Transient visual obscurations may precede permanent loss.
    *   **Sudden, profound visual loss:** Usually severe (Counting fingers or worse).
    *   Periocular pain may be present.

#### Fundus Findings
*   **Chalky White Disc Edema:** The disc appears pallid due to severe ischemia (infarction).
*   **Cotton Wool Spots:** May be associated.
*   **Cilioretinal Artery Occlusion:** Can occur concurrently.

### Comparison: Arteritic vs. Non-Arteritic AION

| Feature | Non-Arteritic AION (NAION) | Arteritic AION (AAION) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Age** | 40–60 years (Mean 60) | Elderly (>70 years) |
| **Etiology** | Atherosclerosis, HTN, DM, Crowded disc | [[Giant Cell Arteritis]] |
| **Systemic Symptoms** | Absent | Present (Jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, weight loss) |
| **Visual Loss** | Moderate to Severe | Severe/Profound |
| **Disc Appearance** | **Hyperemic (Pink) edema**, Sectoral | **Chalky White (Pallid) edema**, Diffuse |
| **ESR & CRP** | Normal | Markedly Elevated |
| **FFA** | Delayed disc filling only | Delayed **choroidal** and disc filling |
| **Treatment** | Control risk factors | High dose systemic steroids |

### Investigations

**1. Blood Tests (Crucial for AAION):**
*   **[[Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate]] (ESR):** Markedly raised in AAION (often >80-100 mm/hr).
*   **[[C-Reactive Protein]] (CRP):** Raised in AAION. More sensitive than ESR.
*   **Complete Blood Count:** May show thrombocytosis or anemia in GCA.

**2. Ocular Imaging:**
*   **Visual Field Testing (Perimetry):** Typically shows **altitudinal field defect** (Inferior > Superior) or arcuate defects.
*   **[[Fundus Fluorescein Angiography]] (FFA):**
    *   **AAION:** Shows delayed **choroidal filling** (choroidal hypoperfusion) and disc filling.
    *   **NAION:** Shows delayed disc filling but normal choroidal filling.

**3. Biopsy (Gold Standard for AAION):**
*   **[[Temporal Artery Biopsy]]:** Shows granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells and disruption of the internal elastic lamina.
*   *Note:* Skip lesions (segmental inflammation) can occur, so a long segment biopsy is recommended.

### Management

#### Non-Arteritic AION (NAION)
*   **No proven effective treatment exists.**
*   **Medical Management:**
    *   Control of systemic risk factors: Hypertension, Diabetes, Hyperlipidemia.
    *   Smoking cessation.
    *   Avoidance of nocturnal hypotension (take anti-hypertensives in the morning).
    *   Aspirin (low dose) may reduce the risk of stroke.
    *   *Investigational:* Brimonidine, neuroprotective agents (results inconclusive). Systemic steroids are generally **not effective**.

#### Arteritic AION (AAION)
*   **This is an Ophthalmic Emergency.**
*   **Goal:** To prevent blindness in the fellow eye (which can occur within days).
*   **Systemic Steroids:** Start immediately upon suspicion (do not wait for biopsy results).
    *   **IV Methylprednisolone:** 1 gm/day for 3–5 days.
    *   **Oral Prednisolone:** Followed by 80-100 mg/day, tapered very slowly over months to years (based on ESR/CRP monitoring).
*   **Prognosis:** Visual recovery in the affected eye is poor, but prompt treatment drastically reduces the risk to the fellow eye.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Differentiating from Optic Neuritis:** AION typically affects older patients ( >50 yrs) and presents with altitudinal defects and a distinct disc appearance (pale or hyperemic swelling with hemorrhages), whereas [[Optic Neuritis]] affects younger patients (20-40 yrs), presents with pain on eye movement, central scotoma, and often a normal disc (retrobulbar).
*   **Viagra & NAION:** Patients with a "disc at risk" should be cautioned about the potential association between [[sildenafil]] and NAION.
