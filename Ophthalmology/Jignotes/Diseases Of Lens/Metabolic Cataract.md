# Metabolic Cataract

Metabolic cataracts occur due to endocrine disorders or biochemical abnormalities where abnormal metabolic products accumulate within the [[crystalline lens]], disrupting its transparency. The two most significant types are Diabetic Cataract and Galactosemic Cataract.

## 1. Pathophysiology of Metabolic Cataracts

The lens relies on [[glucose]] for energy, primarily metabolized via anaerobic glycolysis (80%). The **Sorbitol Pathway (Polyol Pathway)** plays a crucial role in metabolic cataracts.

### The Sorbitol Pathway Mechanism
Under normal conditions, the enzyme [[Hexokinase]] metabolizes available glucose. However, in states of hyperglycemia or galactosemia, hexokinase becomes saturated, and the **Sorbitol Pathway** is activated.

1.  **Accumulation:** High levels of Glucose or Galactose enter the lens.
2.  **Conversion:** The enzyme [[Aldose reductase]] converts sugars into sugar alcohols (Polyols):
    *   Glucose $\rightarrow$ [[Sorbitol]]
    *   Galactose $\rightarrow$ [[Galactitol]] (Dulcitol)
3.  **Osmotic Effect:** Polyols (Sorbitol/Galactitol) cannot easily diffuse out of the lens. They create a hypertonic environment.
4.  **Hydration:** Water is drawn into the lens fibers to equalize osmotic pressure.
5.  **Opacification:** Lens fibers swell, rupture, and create vacuoles, leading to loss of transparency (Cataract).

## 2. Diabetic Cataract

Diabetes mellitus is associated with two distinct types of lenticular changes.

### A. True Diabetic Cataract (Snowflake Cataract)
This is a rare condition occurring typically in **young adults** or adolescents with uncontrolled [[Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus]] (IDDM).

*   **Onset:** Acute and bilateral.
*   **Morphology:**
    *   Large fluid vacuoles appear under the anterior and posterior capsule.
    *   **Snowflake Opacities:** Dense, white subcapsular opacities in the cortex resembling a snowstorm or snowflake.
    *   **Progression:** Very rapid; can mature within a few days to weeks.
*   **Reversibility:** In the very early stages (fluid vacuoles), strict control of hyperglycemia may reverse the opacity. Once proteins coagulate, it is irreversible.

### B. Senile Cataract in Diabetics
This is the most common presentation in older diabetics.

*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Early Onset:** Occurs at a younger age than in non-diabetics.
    *   **Rapid Progression:** matures faster than standard age-related cataract.
    *   **Type:** Often **Nuclear Sclerosis** or [[Cortical Cataract]].
*   **Mechanism:** In addition to osmotic stress, oxidative stress and non-enzymatic glycation of lens proteins contribute to opacity.

### Clinical Implications of Diabetes on the Lens
| Condition | Refractive Change | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hyperglycemia** | **Myopic Shift** | Increased glucose $\rightarrow$ Sorbitol accumulation $\rightarrow$ Hydration $\rightarrow$ Increased curvature/Refractive Index. |
| **Hypoglycemia** | **Hypermetropic Shift** | Rapid reduction of blood sugar causes relative dehydration of the lens. |
| **Presbyopia** | Early Onset | Premature sclerosis reduces accommodation amplitude. |

> **Clinical Note:** Do not prescribe glasses immediately after a significant change in blood sugar levels. Wait for stabilization (usually 2–3 weeks) to avoid [[Refractive surprise]].

## 3. Galactosemic Cataract

This occurs due to an inborn error of galactose metabolism (Autosomal Recessive). It is a cause of **congenital or infantile cataract**.

### Types of Enzyme Deficiency

| Enzyme Defect | Condition | Cataract Features | Systemic Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase]] (GPUT)** | **Classical Galactosemia** | **Oil Droplet Cataract** (Central opacity). More severe. | Failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, mental retardation, vomiting, jaundice. |
| **[[Galactokinase]]** | **Galactokinase Deficiency** | **Lamellar Cataract**. Less severe. | Usually only cataract; systemic features are mild or absent. |

### Clinical Features
*   **Morphology:**
    *   **Oil Droplet Cataract:** A central, refractile opacity appearing like a drop of oil in the center of the lens.
    *   It is essentially a [[Posterior subcapsular cataract]].
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   Presence of reducing substances in urine (Benedict's test positive) after milk feeding.
    *   Assay of RBC transferase and galactokinase levels.

### Management
*   **Dietary Modification:** Elimination of milk and milk products (galactose-free diet).
*   **Reversibility:** This is the **only type of cataract** that is potentially reversible if diagnosed and treated in the very early stages (before protein denaturation occurs).
*   **Surgery:** If the cataract is dense and visually significant, surgical removal (aspiration/lensectomy) is required to prevent [[Amblyopia]].

## 4. Other Metabolic Cataracts

While Diabetes and Galactosemia are the primary metabolic causes, others include:

### A. Hypocalcemic Cataract (Parathyroid Tetany)
*   **Cause:** [[Hypoparathyroidism]] (e.g., accidental removal of parathyroid glands during thyroidectomy) or Vitamin D deficiency.
*   **Mechanism:** Low serum calcium affects membrane permeability.
*   **Morphology:**
    *   **Punctate subcapsular opacities:** Small, discrete, iridescent crystals.
    *   **Zonular/Lamellar Cataract:** If hypocalcemia occurs during the period of lens development (infancy).

### B. Wilson's Disease (Hepatolenticular Degeneration)
*   **Cause:** Error in [[Copper]] metabolism (Ceruloplasmin deficiency).
*   **Ocular Signs:**
    *   **[[Sunflower Cataract]]:** Copper deposition in the anterior capsule and subcapsular cortex arranged in a petal-like pattern. (Also seen in Chalcosis/Intraocular foreign body).
    *   **[[Kayser-Fleischer Ring]]:** Copper deposition in Descemet's membrane of the cornea.

### C. Lowe’s Syndrome (Oculo-Cerebro-Renal Syndrome)
*   **Features:** [[Congenital cataract]], Glaucoma, posterior lenticonus, mental retardation, and renal tubular dysfunction.
*   **Carrier Sign:** Mothers may show micropunctate lens opacities.

### D. Fabry's Disease
*   **Cause:** Alpha-galactosidase A deficiency.
*   **Ocular Sign:** Spoke-like cataract (Fabry's cataract) and [[Vortex keratopathy]] (Cornea verticillata).
