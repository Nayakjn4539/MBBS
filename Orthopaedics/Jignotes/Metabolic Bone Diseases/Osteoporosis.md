# [[Osteoporosis]]

### Definition
[[Osteoporosis]] is a generalized metabolic bone disorder characterized by a **quantitative defect** of the bone. While the quality of the bone remains normal, there is a significant reduction in the **bone mass** (bone quantity) per unit volume. This leads to micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue, resulting in increased bone fragility and susceptibility to fractures.

*   **Key Concept:** "Porous Bone" — Normal mineralization but decreased bone mass.

### Pathophysiology
The core pathology is an uncoupling of the bone remodeling cycle, leading to an imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption.
*   **Imbalance:** [[Osteoclastic]] activity (bone resorption) exceeds [[Osteoblastic]] activity (bone formation).
*   **Result:** Net loss of bone tissue.

### Classification
**1. Primary Osteoporosis**
*   **Type I (Postmenopausal):** Occurs in women aged 55–75 years. Due to [[Estrogen]] deficiency. Primarily affects **trabecular bone** (vertebrae, distal radius). Rate of bone loss is rapid.
*   **Type II (Senile/Age-related):** Occurs in age >70 (females) and >50 (males). Due to decreased osteoblastic activity. Affects both **cortical** and **trabecular bone**. Rate of bone loss is slow but sustained.

**2. Secondary Osteoporosis**
Caused by underlying conditions or medications:
*   **Endocrine:** [[Cushing's syndrome]], [[Hyperthyroidism]], [[Hyperparathyroidism]].
*   **Drugs:** Long-term **Corticosteroids** (most common secondary cause), Heparin, Anticonvulsants.
*   **Others:** Immobilization, [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]], Malnutrition, Malabsorption syndromes.

### Clinical Features
[[Osteoporosis]] is often called a "silent disease" because it remains asymptomatic until a complication (fracture) occurs.
*   **Back Pain:** Often the earliest symptom. Can be acute (due to compression fracture) or chronic.
*   **Loss of Height:** Progressive shortening of the trunk due to vertebral collapse.
*   **Deformity:** [[Kyphosis]] (hunchback/Dowager's hump) due to anterior wedging of thoracic vertebrae.
*   **[[Fragility Fractures]]:** Fractures occurring with trivial trauma. Common sites:
    1.  **Spine** (Vertebral compression fractures) - Most common.
    2.  **Hip** ([[Neck of femur]] fractures).
    3.  **Wrist** ([[Colles' fracture]]).

### Diagnosis and Investigation

#### 1. Plain Radiography (X-Ray)
**Clinical Implication:** X-rays are **insensitive** for early diagnosis. A minimum of **30% bone mass** must be lost before it becomes visible on a plain X-ray.

**Radiological Signs:**
*   Generalized rarefaction (radiolucency) of bones.
*   **Cod Fish Vertebrae:** Biconcave vertebral bodies due to the pressure of the nucleus pulposus on the weakened end-plates.
*   **Wedging:** Anterior collapse of vertebral bodies.
*   **Singh’s Index:** A grading system (Grade 6 to 1) based on the trabecular pattern of the proximal femur (neck) seen on X-ray. Grade 6 is normal; Grade 1-3 indicates severe osteoporosis.

#### 2. Bone Mineral Density (BMD) Assessment
This is the **Gold Standard** for diagnosis and screening.

**[[DEXA Scan]] (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry)**
*   **Principle:** Uses two X-ray beams with different energy levels to estimate bone density.
*   **Sites Scanned:** [[Lumbar Spine]], [[Proximal Femur]] (Hip), and Distal Radius.
*   **Advantages:** High precision, low radiation dose, non-invasive.

**Interpretation of DEXA Scan:**
The results are reported as **T-Scores** and **Z-Scores**.

*   **[[T-Score]]:** Compares the patient's BMD with the peak bone mass of a **healthy young adult** (30-year-old) of the same sex. This is used for **diagnosis**.
*   **[[Z-Score]]:** Compares the patient's BMD with an **age and sex-matched** population. Used to identify secondary causes (if score is low).

**WHO Criteria for Diagnosis (Based on T-Score)**

| Classification | T-Score Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Normal** | -1.0 and above (e.g., +1, 0, -0.5) |
| **[[Osteopenia]]** (Low Bone Mass) | Between -1.0 and -2.5 |
| **[[Osteoporosis]]** | -2.5 and below (e.g., -2.6, -3.0) |
| **Severe Osteoporosis** | -2.5 and below **plus** one or more fragility fractures |

**Screening Guidelines (Indications for DEXA)**:
*   Women aged ≥ 65 years.
*   Men aged ≥ 70 years.
*   Postmenopausal women < 65 years with risk factors.
*   Anyone with a fragility fracture after age 50.

#### 3. Laboratory Investigations
Usually normal in primary osteoporosis. Used to rule out secondary causes or Osteomalacia.
*   **Serum Calcium:** Normal.
*   **Serum Phosphate:** Normal.
*   **Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP):** Normal (unlike Osteomalacia/Rickets where it is elevated).
*   **Bone Markers:**
    *   *Formation:* Serum [[Osteocalcin]], Procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP).
    *   *Resorption:* Urine/Serum C-telopeptide (CTX), Urinary N-telopeptide (NTX).

### Treatment

#### 1. General Measures (Prevention)
*   **Diet:** Adequate intake of [[Calcium]] and [[Vitamin D]].
*   **Lifestyle:** Cessation of smoking and alcohol.
*   **Exercise:** **Weight-bearing exercises** are crucial as they stimulate osteoblastic activity.

#### 2. Pharmacological Therapy
Therapy is broadly classified into Antiresorptive agents (stop bone loss) and Anabolic agents (build new bone).

**A. Antiresorptive Agents (Inhibit Osteoclasts)**
*   **[[Bisphosphonates]] (First Line):**
    *   *Drugs:* [[Alendronate]], Risedronate (Oral); [[Zoledronate]] (IV - once yearly).
    *   *Mechanism:* Induce apoptosis of osteoclasts.
*   **[[Denosumab]]:**
    *   *Mechanism:* Monoclonal antibody against **RANKL**. Inhibits osteoclast maturation.
    *   *Dosage:* Subcutaneous injection every 6 months. Safe in renal failure.
*   **Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators ([[SERMs]]):**
    *   *Drug:* [[Raloxifene]].
    *   *Use:* Postmenopausal osteoporosis (mimics estrogen on bone, blocks on breast/uterus).
*   **[[Calcitonin]]:** Nasal spray, used primarily for analgesic effect in acute vertebral fractures.
*   **Hormone Replacement Therapy ([[HRT]]):** Rarely used now due to side effects; effective in postmenopausal women.

**B. Anabolic Agents (Stimulate Osteoblasts)**
*   **[[Teriparatide]]:** Recombinant PTH.
    *   *Mechanism:* Pulsatile administration stimulates bone formation > resorption.
    *   *Indication:* Severe osteoporosis with fractures.
*   **[[Romosozumab]]:** Anti-sclerostin antibody (increases bone formation).

#### 3. Surgical Management
For complications like fractures:
*   **Hip Fractures:** Internal fixation or Hemiarthroplasty/Total Hip Replacement.
*   **Vertebral Compression Fractures:**
    *   **[[Vertebroplasty]]:** Injection of bone cement (PMMA) into the collapsed vertebra to stabilize it and relieve pain.
    *   **[[Kyphoplasty]]:** Balloon inflation inside the vertebra to restore height followed by cement injection.
