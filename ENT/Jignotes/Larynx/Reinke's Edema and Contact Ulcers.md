# [[Larynx]] > Reinke's Edema and Contact Ulcers

# Reinke's Edema (Polypoid Degeneration)

**Reinke's edema**, also known as **bilateral diffuse polyposis**, **polypoid degeneration of vocal cords**, or **smoker's larynx**, is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the subepithelial space of the vocal cords,,.

### Etiology and Risk Factors
The condition is the result of chronic irritation to the laryngeal mucosa.
*   **Smoking:** Chronic [[tobacco smoking]] is the most predominant factor,,.
*   **Voice Abuse:** Misuse of voice contributes to the irritation,.
*   **Laryngopharyngeal Reflux ([[LPR]]):** Chronic acid exposure can aggravate the condition,.
*   **Hypothyroidism (Myxedema):** Can be a systemic cause.
*   **Demographics:** Commonly seen in middle-aged men and women (often females aged 40–60),.

### Pathophysiology
*   **Anatomy Involved:** The defect occurs in [[Reinke's space]], which is the **superficial layer of the lamina propria ([[SLLP]])** of the [[true vocal cords]],.
*   **Mechanism:** Chronic irritation leads to vasodilation and increased capillary permeability. Because lymphatic drainage in the vocal cords is sparse, this results in the stasis of fluid.
*   **Histology:** The subepithelial space becomes widened and filled with mucoid, gelatinous material or edema fluid that is devoid of cells, fibrous tissue, and blood vessels,.

### Clinical Features
**Symptoms**
*   **Hoarseness:** This is the cardinal symptom. The voice becomes low-pitched, rough, and monotonous,.
*   **"Masculinization" of Voice:** In females, the voice deepens significantly (similar to a male voice) due to the increased mass of the vocal folds.
*   **Dyspnea:** In severe cases, the swelling can cause airway obstruction or stridor.
*   **Diplophonia:** Occasionally present.

**Signs**
*   **Laryngoscopy:**
    *   Bilateral, symmetrical, diffuse swelling of the membranous part of the vocal cords.
    *   **Appearance:** The cords look like pale, translucent, water-logged "sausage-like" masses or bags of fluid,.
    *   **Movement:** The bags of fluid flop up and down into the glottis during respiration and phonation.
    *   **Color:** Usually grayish-pink or pale, but may appear bright red if acute inflammation is superimposed.

### Management
**Conservative/Medical**
*   **Cessation of Smoking:** This is the most essential step. It stops progression but rarely reverses extensive edema,.
*   **Vocal Hygiene:** Speech therapy to correct voice misuse.
*   **Anti-reflux Therapy:** Management of [[GERD]]/LPR.

**Surgical**
Surgery is indicated if airway obstruction is present or if voice quality is unsatisfactory despite conservative measures.
*   **Decortication / Stripping:** Removal of the edematous tissue. Care must be taken to preserve the vocal ligament.
*   **Reduction Glottoplasty:** A longitudinal incision is made on the superior surface of the vocal cord, the viscous fluid is suctioned out, and the redundant mucosa is trimmed (mucosa-sparing approach).
    *   *Note:* Surgery is usually done on one cord at a time or carefully performed to avoid injuring the [[anterior commissure]], which could lead to web formation.

# Contact Ulcers and Granulomas

**Contact ulcers** (or **arytenoid granulomas**) are benign lesions resulting from mucosal injury over the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilages, leading to ulceration and subsequent granuloma formation,.

### Etiology
*   **Vocal Abuse (Hyperfunctional Voice):** "Hammering" of the vocal processes of arytenoids against each other during loud talking, throat clearing, or coughing,.
*   **Laryngopharyngeal Reflux ([[LPR]]):** Acid reflux bathes the posterior larynx, causing irritation and ulceration,.
*   **Intubation Trauma:** Also called **Intubation Granuloma**. Caused by rough intubation, large endotracheal tubes, or prolonged intubation where the tube exerts pressure on the posterior commissure,,.
*   **Psychological Stress:** Associated with "passive-aggressive" or tense personalities.

### Pathophysiology
*   **Location:** Posterior third of the vocal cords, specifically the vocal process of the [[arytenoid cartilage]],.
*   **Mechanism:** The mucoperichondrium over the vocal process is thin and vascular. Constant trauma (mechanical or chemical via acid) causes mucosal breakdown.
*   **Progression:** The ulceration attempts to heal but is frustrated by continued trauma/infection, leading to the proliferation of granulation tissue (granuloma),.

### Clinical Features
**Symptoms**
*   **Pain:** Unilateral mild pain localized to the thyroid cartilage or radiating to the ear ([[referred otalgia]]),.
*   **Hoarseness:** May be mild or severe depending on the size of the granuloma preventing cord approximation,.
*   **Globus Sensation:** A feeling of a lump or foreign body in the throat.
*   **Throat Clearing:** A constant desire to clear the throat, which creates a vicious cycle of further trauma.
*   **Dyspnea:** Rare, seen with large bilateral granulomas.

**Signs (Laryngoscopy)**
*   **Ulceration:** Appears on the vocal process of the arytenoid.
*   **Granuloma:** A nodular, red or pale, sessile or pedunculated mass.
*   **"Cup and Saucer" Effect:** Sometimes a granuloma on one side fits into an ulcer crater on the opposing vocal process,.
*   **Location:** Strictly posterior glottis (unlike nodules/polyps which are anterior/mid-glottic).

### Management
**Medical (First Line)**
*   **Anti-reflux Therapy:** Aggressive management with Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) and lifestyle changes.
*   **Voice Therapy:** Essential to correct faulty voice production (low pitch/glottal fry) and stop throat clearing,.
*   **Botulinum Toxin:** Injection into the thyroarytenoid muscle to prevent forceful adduction (slamming) of cords.
*   **Steroids:** Inhalers or intralesional injections to reduce inflammation,.

**Surgical**
*   **Microlaryngeal Surgery ([[MLS]]):** Reserved for cases refractory to medical therapy, if the airway is obstructed, or if malignancy is suspected.
*   **Recurrence:** Recurrence rates are high after surgical excision if the underlying cause (voice abuse/reflux) is not addressed,.

### Mnemonic for Contact Ulcers: **Hammer**
*   **H**ammering of arytenoids (Etiology)
*   **A**cid reflux (Major cause)
*   **M**en (More common in men, unlike nodules)
*   **M**icrolaryngoscopy (Only if medical tx fails)
*   **E**ar pain (Referred otalgia)
*   **R**ear (Posterior) larynx location
