# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Universal precautions to prevent HIV

### Universal Precautions to Prevent HIV

**Definition**
[[Universal Precautions]] refer to the practice in medicine where blood and certain body fluids of **all patients** are considered potentially infectious for [[HIV]], [[Hepatitis B]] (HBV), and other blood-borne pathogens, regardless of their infection status. This concept eliminates the need to identify "high-risk" patients, ensuring consistent protection for health care workers (HCWs).

**Objective**
The primary goal is to prevent parenteral, mucous membrane, and non-intact skin exposures of health care workers to blood-borne pathogens.

### Key Components of Universal Precautions

The basic components that must be practiced by all medical and paramedical workers include:

**1. Hand Hygiene**
*   Wash hands thoroughly with soap under running water:
    *   Before carrying out any procedure.
    *   Immediately if gloves are torn and hands are contaminated with blood or body fluids.
    *   Soon after the procedure (with gloves on) and **again after removing the gloves**,.
*   If soap and water are not available, use a suitable alcohol-based disinfectant.

**2. Barrier Protection ([[Personal Protective Equipment]] - PPE)**
Use appropriate barriers to prevent skin and mucous membrane exposure when contact with blood or body fluids is anticipated.
*   **Gloves:** Must be worn when touching blood, body fluids, mucous membranes, or non-intact skin. Change gloves between patients.
*   **Masks and Eyewear:** Wear goggles/glasses and masks during procedures that are likely to generate droplets or splashes of blood,.
*   **Gowns/Aprons:** Wear waterproof aprons or gowns during procedures that are likely to generate splashes.

**3. Safe Handling of Sharps**
*   Handle needles, scalpels, and other sharps with extreme care.
*   **Do not recap needles.**
*   Dispose of sharps in puncture-proof containers immediately after use.
*   Use **[[Auto-disabled syringes]]** wherever possible to prevent reuse.

**4. Spills Management**
*   Clean up spills of infective material promptly.
*   Flood the area with a disinfectant, commonly **1% Sodium Hypochlorite** (bleaching powder solution), before cleaning.

**5. Sterilization and Disinfection**
*   **Sterilization:** All instruments (e.g., scalpels, forceps) must be autoclaved or subjected to high-level disinfection.
*   **Decontamination:** Thorough cleaning of instruments immediately after use is essential before sterilization.

**6. Waste Disposal**
*   Segregate waste at the source.
*   Infectious waste must be disposed of in color-coded bags (e.g., **Yellow bag** for human anatomical waste, **Red bag** for contaminated plastic) as per [[Biomedical Waste Management Rules]],.

### Application to Body Fluids

Not all body fluids require the same level of precaution. Universal precautions apply specifically to fluids implicated in HIV transmission,.

| **Fluids Requiring Universal Precautions** (Potentially Infectious) | **Fluids NOT Requiring Universal Precautions** (Unless visibly bloody) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Blood** | Feces |
| Semen | Nasal secretions |
| Vaginal secretions | Sputum |
| Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) | Sweat |
| Synovial fluid | Tears |
| Pleural fluid | Urine |
| Pericardial fluid | Vomitus |
| Peritoneal fluid | |
| Amniotic fluid | |

### Clinical Relevance: Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)

If a breach in universal precautions occurs (e.g., [[Needle stick injury]]), **[[Post-Exposure Prophylaxis]] (PEP)** is critical.
*   **Immediate Action:** Wash the affected part with soap and water. Do **not** panic or put the finger in the mouth.
*   **Timing:** Start PEP as soon as possible, ideally within **2 hours** (maximum 72 hours).
*   **Reporting:** Report the incident to the hospital infection control committee immediately.

### Mnemonic for Universal Precautions

To remember the components, use **"W.H.O. G.A.V.E."**:

*   **W**ash hands (Hand Hygiene)
*   **H**andle sharps safely (No recapping)
*   **O**bserve fluid guidelines (Blood vs. Sweat)
*   **G**loves and Gowns (PPE)
*   **A**utoclave instruments (Sterilization)
*   **V**accination (Hep B for HCWs)
*   **E**nvironmental control (Spill management/Waste disposal)

*(Note: While vaccines protect the worker, they are part of the broader infection control strategy supporting universal precautions)*
