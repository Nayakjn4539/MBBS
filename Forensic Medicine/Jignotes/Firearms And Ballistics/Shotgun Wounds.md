# [[Firearms And Ballistics]] > Shotgun Wounds

### **Shotgun Wounds**

A [[shotgun]] is a smooth-bore firearm that discharges a charge of multiple small lead pellets (shots) instead of a single bullet. The wounding pattern produced by a shotgun is fundamentally different from rifled firearms and is entirely dependent on the **range of fire**.

---

### **1. Mechanics of Wounding**
Unlike a single bullet, a shotgun discharges a mass of pellets, a wad, and gas.
*   **At the muzzle:** The pellets emerge as a solid, compact mass (acting like a single missile).
*   **With distance:** The pellets begin to spread out (disperse) in a cone-like fashion.
*   **The Wound Profile:** Depends on the **dispersion of pellets** and the presence of **accessory components** (flame, smoke, wads).

### **2. Characteristics of Shotgun Entry Wounds**

The appearance of the entrance wound changes drastically as the distance between the muzzle and the body increases.

#### **A. Contact and Near-Contact Wounds (0 to 15 cm)**
*   **Appearance:** A large, single circular or oval defect.
*   **Margins:** Irregular, ragged, and possibly serrated ("rat-nibbled").
*   **Skin Effects:**
    *   **Muzzle Impression:** In tight contact shots, a [[muzzle impression]] or abrasion may be seen on the skin due to the forceful expansion of gas against the skin.
    *   **Cherry Red Discoloration:** The tissues in the wound track may be pink/cherry red due to [[carbon monoxide]] absorption from the combustion gases.
    *   **Singeing/Burning:** Hair is burnt; skin is blackened by soot.
*   **Skull:** If fired against the head, the explosive force of the gas can cause massive destruction, often bursting the skull open (**bursting fractures**).

#### **B. Close Range (15 cm to 1 meter)**
*   **Wound:** Still a single hole, but the margins become scalloped or crenated.
*   **"Rat-Hole" Appearance:** At roughly **1 meter (approx. 1 yard)**, the pellets just begin to separate, creating a central hole with irregular, scalloped edges, often described as a "rat-hole".
*   **Intermediate Targets:**
    *   **Wad:** The [[wad]] (felt or plastic component separating powder and shot) usually enters the body through the main wound.
    *   **Plastic Wad Pattern:** Modern plastic wads have "petals" that open up in flight. At close range, these petals can cause a characteristic **Maltese Cross** or **cruciate abrasion** around the central hole.
*   **Powder Marks:**
    *   **Blackening (Soot):** Visible up to 30 cm.
    *   **Tattooing (Stippling):** Unburnt powder grains embed in the skin up to 60–90 cm.

#### **C. Intermediate Range (1 to 2 meters)**
*   **Dispersion Begins:** The main mass of pellets creates a central hole, but individual pellets start to break away from the main group.
*   **Satellite Holes:** Small, individual holes appear around the central defect. These are caused by the stray pellets separating from the main mass.
*   **Wad:** The wad may strike the skin near the wound or enter the wound, depending on the exact distance (usually falls off after 2–3 meters).

#### **D. Distant Range (> 2-3 meters)**
*   **No Central Hole:** The main hole disappears.
*   **Sieve-like Appearance:** The pellets are fully dispersed. The injury appears as numerous, separate, small circular holes spread over an area.
*   **No Powder Effects:** No blackening, tattooing, or singing is present.
*   **Measurement of Range:** The diameter of the spread of the shot pattern (in inches) is roughly equal to the distance of the gun (in yards) for a non-choked barrel.
    *   **Metric Rule of Thumb:** The spread of the shot pattern (in cm) divided by 3 gives the rough range in meters.

### **3. Estimation of Range of Fire (Summary)**

| Range | Wound Appearance | Burning/Soot/Tattooing | Wad |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Contact** | Single, ragged hole; Muzzle imprint possible; Cherry red tissues | Intense burning & soot in wound track | Inside wound |
| **< 15 cm** | Single circular hole | Burning, Singeing, Blackening present | Inside wound |
| **< 1 m** | **"Rat-hole"** (scalloped margins) | Tattooing (Stippling) present | Inside wound or Maltese cross abrasion |
| **1-2 m** | Central hole with **Satellite pellets** | Absent (usually) | May mark skin or enter |
| **> 3 m** | No central hole; uniform spread (peppering) | Absent | Falls away |

> **Mnemonic for Range Estimation: "RATS"**
> *   **R** - **R**at hole (~1 meter)
> *   **A** - **A**brasion (Maltese cross from wad)
> *   **T** - **T**ight contact (Muzzle impression)
> *   **S** - **S**atellite pellets (Intermediate range)

### **4. Exit Wounds in Shotgun Injuries**
Unlike rifled firearms, shotgun pellets have low mass and low velocity individually.
*   **Often Absent:** In the trunk or abdomen, pellets rarely have enough energy to exit the body. They are usually found embedded in the tissues.
*   **Exceptions:**
    *   **Contact shots to the head:** The massive force can blow out skull fragments and pellets.
    *   **Thin body parts:** Neck or limbs fired at close range.
*   **Appearance:** If present, exit wounds are usually irregular, lacerated, and lack abrasion collars or soot.

### **5. Factors Affecting Wound Ballistics**
1.  **Choke:** A constriction at the muzzle end of the barrel. A **Full Choke** keeps pellets together longer (tighter pattern); a **Cylinder Bore** allows faster spread.
2.  **Gauge:** The diameter of the barrel. Smaller gauge (e.g., 12-gauge) = larger bore.
3.  **Intermediate Targets:** Clothing, windows, or doors can cause the pellet mass to break up earlier or deform, altering the range estimation ("Billiard ball effect").

---

### **6. Autopsy Findings & Procedure**
*   **Radiology (X-Ray/CT):** **Mandatory** before dissection.
    *   To locate the pellets (lead snowstorm appearance).
    *   To locate the **wad** (which is radiolucent but may be identified by shape/void).
    *   To count pellets (if few) to determine shot size.
*   **Recovery of Evidence:**
    *   **The Wad:** The most important piece of evidence. It reveals the **gauge** of the gun and the **manufacturer** of the ammunition.
    *   **Pellets:** Recover a representative sample to measure size and weight (helps identify birdshot vs. buckshot).
    *   **Clothing:** Do not cut through bullet holes; air-dry wet bloodstained clothes.
*   **Dissection:** Trace the wound track. Note that wads often do not travel as deep as pellets.

### **7. Medicolegal Importance**
*   **Suicide:** Very common with shotguns.
    *   **Site:** Mouth (intra-oral), under the chin, chest, or forehead.
    *   **Reach:** Due to the long barrel, the victim may use a toe or a stick/string to pull the trigger. Look for shoe removal.
*   **Homicide:**
    *   Usually distinct ranges (not contact).
    *   Multiple shots or shots to inaccessible areas (back).
    *   Defense wounds on forearms if the victim raised hands against the spread.
*   **Accident:** Common in hunters (crossing fences with loaded guns) or cleaning accidents.
