# [[Corrosive Poisons]] > Oxalic Acid

### [[Oxalic Acid]]
**Synonyms:** Acid of sugar, Salt of sorrel.

#### 1. General Characteristics
*   **Physical Appearance:** It consists of colorless, transparent, prismatic crystals.
*   **Resemblance:** It closely resembles **[[Magnesium Sulphate]]** (Epsom salt) and **Zinc Sulphate** in appearance, leading to accidental poisoning.
*   **Taste:** Sour and acidic.
*   **Sources:**
    *   **Household/Industrial:** Bleaching agents, metal cleaners, rust/ink stain removers, leather tanning, and photography.
    *   **Vegetable sources:** Found in spinach, **rhubarb leaves**, and wood sorrel.

#### 2. Mode of Action
It acts in three distinct ways:
1.  **Local Action:** It acts as a **corrosive** (mild to moderate) to the mucous membranes.
2.  **Systemic Action (Primary toxicity):** After absorption, it combines with ionized calcium in the blood to form insoluble **[[Calcium Oxalate]]**. This leads to severe **[[Hypocalcemia]]**, causing tetany and cardiac pathology.
3.  **Renal Action:** The insoluble calcium oxalate crystals are excreted by the kidneys, where they block the renal tubules, causing **[[Acute Tubular Necrosis]]** and renal failure.

#### 3. Fatal Dose and Period
| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fatal Dose** | 15 to 30 grams |
| **Fatal Period** | 1 to 2 hours (can be rapid due to shock/hypocalcemia) |

#### 4. Clinical Features
**A. Local Symptoms (Gastrointestinal)**
*   **Taste:** Sour, acid, burning taste in the mouth.
*   **Pain:** Burning sensation in the throat and stomach.
*   **Vomiting:** Constant vomiting; vomit is bloody or "coffee-ground" in appearance.
*   **Dysphagia:** Difficulty in swallowing due to irritation.

**B. Systemic Symptoms (Due to [[Hypocalcemia]])**
This is the most critical presentation:
*   **Tetany:** Muscle twitching, cramps, and convulsions.
*   **Specific Signs:**
    *   **[[Chvostek's sign]]:** Facial twitching when the facial nerve is tapped.
    *   **[[Trousseau's sign]]:** Carpopedal spasm upon inflating a BP cuff.
    *   **[[Accoucheur's hand]]:** Spasm of the hand muscles.
*   **Cardiac:** Hypotension, ventricular fibrillation, and shock.

**C. Renal Symptoms**
*   Oliguria (reduced urine), anuria, and uremia.
*   **Oxaluria:** Presence of calcium oxalate crystals in urine (envelope or dumbbell-shaped).

> **Mnemonic for Symptoms: "OXALIC"**
> *   **O**xalate crystals in urine
> *   **X**-rays show renal stones (chronic)
> *   **A**ccoucheur’s hand (Tetany)
> *   **L**ow Calcium ([[Hypocalcemia]])
> *   **I**nk remover (Source)
> *   **C**offee ground vomit / **C**orrosive

#### 5. Diagnosis
1.  **Urine Microscopy:** Reveals **calcium oxalate crystals** (monohydrate are dumbbell/needle-shaped; dihydrate are envelope-shaped).
2.  **Serum Electrolytes:** Marked hypocalcemia.
3.  **[[Electrocardiogram]] (ECG):** Prolonged QT interval due to hypocalcemia.

#### 6. Treatment
**Immediate measures are critical:**
1.  **[[Gastric Lavage]]:**
    *   Must be done with caution.
    *   **Fluid of Choice:** **Limewater**, **Calcium gluconate**, **Calcium lactate**, or milk. These form insoluble calcium oxalate which is not absorbed.
    *   **CONTRAINDICATION:** **Do NOT use alkalis** like Sodium Bicarbonate or Potassium Hydroxide. They form soluble oxalates (Sodium/Potassium Oxalate) which are readily absorbed and increase systemic toxicity.
2.  **Systemic Treatment:**
    *   **IV [[Calcium Gluconate]]:** 10 ml of 10% solution IV (slowly) to correct hypocalcemia and treat tetany.
    *   **Parathyroid extract:** May be given.
3.  **Renal Support:**
    *   Maintain high fluid intake to flush crystals.
    *   **Hemodialysis** if renal failure sets in.
4.  **Demulcents:** Milk, egg whites to soothe mucosa.

#### 7. Autopsy Findings
**External:** Signs of corrosion on lips/mouth may be whitish or yellowish.

**Internal:**
*   **Mucosa:** The mucous membrane of the mouth, pharynx, and esophagus appears white, bleached, and **"Scalded"**.
*   **Stomach:**
    *   Mucosa is corroded, detached in patches.
    *   Color may be brown/black due to acid hematin formation.
    *   Submucosal blood vessels show dark brown/black streaks.
*   **Kidneys:**
    *   Congested and swollen.
    *   White line at the boundary of the cortex and medulla.
    *   Microscopy reveals **oxalate crystals** in the tubules.

#### 8. Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Accidental Poisoning:** Most common. Often mistaken for **[[Magnesium Sulphate]] (Epsom salt)** or Sodium Bicarbonate due to physical resemblance. Also seen in children eating rhubarb leaves.
*   **Suicidal:** Used occasionally as it is accessible (cheap household cleaner/stain remover).
*   **Homicidal:** Rare due to the sour taste, but possible if mixed with strongly flavored drinks like coffee/liquor.
*   **Forgery:** It is used as an **ink remover** by criminals to alter documents or signatures (known as "Eraser poison").
*   **Vitriolage:** Rarely used for throwing (acid attacks), but less effective than mineral acids.
