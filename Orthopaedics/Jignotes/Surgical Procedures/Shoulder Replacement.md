# Shoulder Replacement (Arthroplasty)

[[Shoulder replacement]], or [[arthroplasty]], involves the removal of damaged areas of the [[glenohumeral joint]] and replacing them with artificial components (prosthesis) to relieve pain and restore function,.

### Types of Shoulder Arthroplasty

The procedure is broadly categorized based on the extent of joint replacement:

1.  **[[Hemiarthroplasty]]**
    *   **Definition:** Replacement of only the **head of the humerus** with a prosthesis. The natural [[glenoid fossa]] (socket) is left intact.
    *   **Indications:**
        *   Comminuted [[proximal humerus fractures]] where the head is not viable.
        *   [[Avascular necrosis]] (AVN) of the humeral head where the glenoid cartilage is preserved.
    *   **Implant:** Usually a stemmed prosthesis (e.g., [[Neer's prosthesis]]) inserted into the humeral shaft.

2.  **[[Total Shoulder Replacement]]**
    *   **Definition:** Replacement of **both** the humeral head and the glenoid surface.
    *   **Components:**
        *   **Humeral Component:** A metal ball attached to a stem inserted into the humerus.
        *   **Glenoid Component:** A cup usually made of high-density [[polyethylene]] to replace the socket,.
    *   **Indications:** End-stage arthritis ([[osteoarthritis]] or [[rheumatoid arthritis]]) where both articulating surfaces are damaged.

### Indications for Surgery

The primary goal of shoulder replacement is **pain relief**, followed by the restoration of motion and function.

#### 1. Trauma (Fractures)
*   **Comminuted Fractures:** Specifically **3-part or 4-part fractures** of the [[proximal humerus]] (according to [[Neer's classification]]),.
*   **Elderly Patients:** In older patients with osteoporotic bone, internal fixation may fail; primary prosthetic replacement is often preferred,.
*   **Split Head Fractures:** Where the articular surface is split and unrepairable.

#### 2. Arthritis
*   **[[Osteoarthritis]] (OA):** Severe degeneration of the joint causing bone-on-bone contact, pain, and stiffness.
*   **[[Rheumatoid Arthritis]] (RA):**
    *   **Wet Type:** Rapid progression with periarticular erosions.
    *   **Dry Type:** Sclerosis and osteophytes (similar to OA).
    *   **Resorptive Type:** Marked bone loss (arthritis mutilans).
    *   **Clinical Implication:** In RA, the [[rotator cuff]] status is crucial; severe cuff damage may alter the choice of prosthesis.

#### 3. Other Causes
*   **[[Avascular Necrosis]] (AVN):** Death of the humeral head bone tissue due to lack of blood supply (e.g., post-traumatic, steroid-induced).
*   **Tumors:** [[Bone tumors]] involving the proximal humerus requiring wide resection and reconstruction.
*   **[[Milwaukee Shoulder]]:** A destructive arthropathy associated with hydroxyapatite crystals and rotator cuff defects.

### Implant Design and Materials

*   **Materials:**
    *   **Humeral Head:** Metal alloy (Cobalt-Chrome).
    *   **Glenoid Cup:** High-density [[polyethylene]].
*   **Fixation:** Components can be cemented (using [[polymethylmethacrylate]]) or uncemented (press-fit with porous coating for bone ingrowth), depending on bone quality.
*   **Design Variations:**
    *   **Unconstrained:** Most common; mimics normal anatomy; requires an intact [[rotator cuff]] for stability.
    *   **Constrained/Semiconstrained:** Used when the rotator cuff is deficient to prevent dislocation (e.g., [[Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty]] concepts).

### Surgical Considerations

*   **Preoperative Planning:** X-rays (AP and Axillary views) and sometimes CT scans are used to assess bone stock and glenoid version.
*   **Approach:** typically the **Deltopectoral approach** is used to expose the joint while protecting the [[cephalic vein]] and [[axillary nerve]].
*   **Procedure Steps (Hemiarthroplasty/Trauma):**
    1.  Remove the fractured/damaged humeral head.
    2.  Prepare the medullary canal of the humerus.
    3.  Insert the trial prosthesis to check height and version (retroversion is standard).
    4.  Insert the final prosthesis (often cemented in trauma).
    5.  **Crucial Step:** Repair the [[tuberosities]] (greater and lesser) to the prosthesis and shaft to restore rotator cuff function.

### Complications

| Complication | Details | Clinical Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Nerve Injury]]** | [[Axillary nerve]] is most at risk due to its proximity to the inferior capsule and surgical neck. | Check "Regiment Badge" sensation post-op. |
| **Instability** | Dislocation or subluxation of the prosthesis. | Often due to component malposition or soft tissue imbalance. |
| **[[Infection]]** | Periprosthetic infection. | May require removal of implant and staged revision. |
| **Loosening** | Aseptic loosening of the glenoid component is a common long-term mode of failure. | Presents as returning pain years after surgery. |
| **Stiffness** | "Frozen" prosthesis. | Aggressive rehabilitation is required. |
| **Periprosthetic Fracture** | Fracture around the stem. | Occurs intra-operatively during reaming or post-operatively from falls. |

### Postoperative Rehabilitation

*   **Immobilization:** The arm is usually supported in a sling initially.
*   **Early Phase:** Passive range of motion exercises are started early to prevent stiffness.
*   **Late Phase:** Active strengthening exercises are introduced once soft tissues (especially the repaired tuberosities in fracture cases) have healed (approx. 6 weeks).
*   **Outcome:** Relief of pain is generally excellent; range of motion varies depending on the underlying pathology and rotator cuff status.
