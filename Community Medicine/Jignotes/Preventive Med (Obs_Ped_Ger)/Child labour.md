# [[PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IN OBSTETRICS, PAEDIATRICS AND GERIATRICS]] > Child labour

### Definition
**Child labour** is defined as an individual who has not yet attained the age of **14 years**, suffering physical and mental development due to his/her premature employment. 

It involves work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential, and their dignity, and that is harmful to physical and mental development.

### Problem Statement and Epidemiology
*   **Global Burden:** Worldwide, approximately **152 million** children are victims of child labour. Almost half of them (73 million) work in hazardous conditions.
*   **Indian Scenario:** India fosters a large number of child labourers. Estimates suggest about **4.4 million** children are engaged in child labour.
*   **Gender:** Boys (58%) appear to face a greater risk of child labour than girls, though girls are often under-reported in domestic labour.
*   **Sector Distribution:**
    *   **Agriculture (71%):** Farming, fishing, forestry, livestock herding.
    *   **Services (17%)**.
    *   **Industry (12%):** Including mining.

### Etiology: Causes of Child Labour
Child labour is deeply rooted in socio-economic factors.

*   **Poverty:** The primary driver; families rely on children's income for survival.
*   **Illiteracy:** Lack of education and school dropouts contribute significantly.
*   **Large Family Size:** Increases the economic burden, pushing children to work.
*   **Migration:** Displaced families often rely on child work.
*   **Social Factors:** Discrimination, [[Casteism]], and lack of social protection measures.
*   **Employment Demand:** Demand for cheap labour in unorganized sectors.

### Common Sectors of Employment
| Area | Common Occupations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Rural Areas** | Agriculture, Animal husbandry, Forestry, Fisheries |
| **Urban Areas** | Matches and fireworks, Glass industry, Carpet weaving, Jewellery industries, Household/Domestic labour |

**Note:** Children in **domestic service** are considered the "most invisible" child labourers, often paid little or nothing and highly susceptible to physical/psychological harm.

### Health Hazards
Child labourers have lower growth and health status compared to non-working counterparts.
1.  **Physical:** Exposure to occupational hazards (chemicals, machinery), malnutrition, growth retardation, and physical injuries,.
2.  **Developmental:** Arrested personality development.
3.  **Protection Issues:** Vulnerability to sexual exploitation, trafficking, and abuse,.

### Prevention and Control
Strategies involve a mix of constitutional, legislative, and developmental measures.

#### 1. Constitutional Measures
The [[Constitution of India]] provides specific protections,,:
*   **Article 24:** Prohibits employment of children below the age of **14 years** in factories, mines, or hazardous employment.
*   **Article 39:** Directs policy to ensure children of tender age are not abused and citizens are not forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their age or strength.
*   **Article 45:** Provides for free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the age of 14 years.

#### 2. Legislative Measures
**The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986:**
This act prohibits children from working in specific occupations and processes, except in family-based work or recognized school-based activities.
*   *Prohibited Occupations include:*
    *   Passenger/goods transport by railways.
    *   Carpet weaving.
    *   Cement manufacturing.
    *   Building construction.
    *   Cloth printing, dyeing, and weaving.
    *   Manufacturing of matches, explosives, and fireworks.
    *   [[Beedi]] making.
    *   Soldering processes in electronic industries,.

**Other Acts:**
*   **The Factories Act, 1948:** Prohibits employment of children below 14 years.
*   **Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015:** Addresses children in need of care and protection.

#### 3. Developmental Measures
*   **National Child Labour Project Scheme (1988):** Aimed at rehabilitation of child labourers.
*   **Compulsory Primary Education:** Keeping children in school is the most effective way to prevent them from entering the workforce.

### Clinical Relevance
*   **History Taking:** When a child presents with injuries, chronic fatigue, or growth faltering, always take a detailed social history regarding potential employment.
*   **Occupational Diseases:** Be vigilant for signs of pneumoconiosis (in mining/construction areas), chemical burns, or pesticide poisoning in children from agricultural backgrounds.
*   **Social Paediatrics:** Doctors act as advocates for the child's rights and should report suspected exploitation to child welfare committees.
