# [[Nerve Injuries]] > Tibial Nerve Injury

### [[Tibial Nerve Injury]]

The [[Tibial Nerve]] is the larger terminal branch of the [[Sciatic Nerve]] (Root value: L4, L5, S1, S2, S3). Because it is deeply situated within the popliteal fossa and the deep posterior compartment of the leg, it is injured far less frequently than the [[Common Peroneal Nerve]].

### Etiology
1.  **Trauma:**
    *   Deep penetrating wounds in the [[Popliteal Fossa]] or posterior calf.
    *   **[[Knee Dislocation]]:** Often associated with severe multi-ligament injuries.
    *   Fractures of the proximal [[Tibia]] or distal femur.
    *   Fractures around the ankle (involving the [[Medial Malleolus]]).
2.  **Compression (Entrapment):**
    *   **[[Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome]]:** Compression of the nerve behind the medial malleolus under the [[Flexor Retinaculum]].
    *   **Compartment Syndrome:** Deep posterior compartment syndrome of the leg.
3.  **Iatrogenic:** During surgeries in the popliteal fossa or improper cast application.

### Clinical Features
The clinical presentation depends on the level of the lesion (High vs. Low).

#### 1. High Lesion (Popliteal Fossa)
This results in a complete palsy involving muscles of the back of the leg and the sole of the foot.

**Motor Loss:**
*   **Paralysis of Calf Muscles:** [[Gastrocnemius]], [[Soleus]], and [[Plantaris]].
    *   *Result:* Loss of ankle **plantarflexion**. The patient cannot stand on tiptoes or push off during walking.
*   **Paralysis of Deep Posterior Muscles:** [[Tibialis Posterior]], [[Flexor Digitorum Longus]], [[Flexor Hallucis Longus]].
    *   *Result:* Loss of **inversion** (though some inversion is preserved by the [[Tibialis Anterior]]) and loss of toe flexion.
*   **Paralysis of Intrinsic Foot Muscles:** Loss of abduction and adduction of toes.

**Sensory Loss:**
*   **Anesthesia:** Loss of sensation over the **sole of the foot** (the autonomous zone of the tibial nerve), the plantar surface of the toes, and the heel.
*   **Trophic Changes:** Because the sole is the weight-bearing area, anesthesia here is dangerous. **[[Trophic Ulcers]]** (neuropathic ulcers) frequently develop on the heel or metatarsal heads due to unrecognized pressure/trauma.

**Deformity:**
*   **[[Calcaneovalgus Deformity]]:** Due to the unopposed action of the dorsiflexors (Deep peroneal nerve) and evertors (Superficial peroneal nerve), the foot assumes a position of **Dorsiflexion and Eversion**.
*   **[[Claw Toes]]:** Due to paralysis of the intrinsic muscles of the foot (similar to an ulnar claw hand).

#### 2. Low Lesion (Ankle/Tarsal Tunnel)
Occurs distal to the innervation of the calf muscles.
*   **Motor:** Calf muscles are spared (plantarflexion is intact). Intrinsic muscles of the foot are paralyzed, leading to **[[Claw Toes]]**.
*   **Sensory:** Numbness over the sole of the foot.

### Specific Condition: [[Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome]]
This is an entrapment neuropathy of the [[Posterior Tibial Nerve]] within the fibro-osseous tunnel behind the [[Medial Malleolus]].

**Causes:**
*   Space-occupying lesions: [[Ganglion]], Lipoma, Varicose veins.
*   Post-traumatic: Malunited fractures of the medial malleolus or [[Calcaneum]].
*   Inflammatory: [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]], Tenosynovitis.
*   Deformities: Severe [[Valgus Deformity]] of the hindfoot.

**Clinical Features:**
*   **Pain:** Burning pain, tingling, and numbness in the sole of the foot and toes.
*   **Aggravation:** Pain worsens with activity, prolonged standing, or at night.
*   **Tenderness:** Over the tarsal tunnel behind the medial malleolus.
*   **Tinel's Sign:** Percussion over the nerve behind the medial malleolus produces tingling radiating into the sole.

**Diagnosis:**
*   **Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS):** Shows delayed conduction across the tarsal tunnel.
*   **MRI:** To rule out space-occupying lesions.

**Treatment:**
*   **Conservative:** NSAIDs, medial arch supports, local steroid injections.
*   **Surgical:** Decompression of the tarsal tunnel (release of the [[Flexor Retinaculum]]).

| **Primary Sensory Loss** | Sole of the foot | Dorsum of the foot |
| **Deformity** | [[Calcaneovalgus]] | [[Equinovarus]] |
| **Gait** | Calcaneal gait (no push-off) | High-stepping gait (Foot drop) |
| **Complications** | [[Trophic Ulcers]] (common) | Trophic ulcers (rare) |

### Management of Tibial Nerve Injury

#### 1. General Measures
*   **Prevention of Deformity:** Splinting the foot to prevent dorsiflexion contracture.
*   **Skin Care:** meticulous care of the anesthetic sole to prevent [[Trophic Ulcers]]. Use of microcellular rubber (MCR) footwear to distribute pressure evenly.

#### 2. Operative Management
*   **Nerve Repair:**
    *   **Primary Repair:** For clean cut injuries (neurotmesis).
    *   **Nerve Grafting:** If there is a gap (e.g., using [[Sural Nerve]] graft).
*   **Neurolysis:** For entrapment neuropathies (like Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome) or neuromas in continuity.

#### 3. Reconstructive Surgery (For Irreversible Paralysis)
If nerve recovery does not occur, tendon transfers are performed to restore function and correct deformity.
*   **Goal:** To restore active plantarflexion (if possible) and correct clawing.
*   **Transfer:** [[Tibialis Anterior]] or Peroneal tendons may be transferred to the [[Calcaneum]] (though results are often less satisfactory than upper limb transfers due to the heavy loads involved in walking).
*   **Arthrodesis:** **[[Triple Arthrodesis]]** (fusion of subtalar, calcaneocuboid, and talonavicular joints) provides a stable, plantigrade foot for walking.

### Clinical Implications
*   **[[Trophic Ulcers]]:** The most disabling aspect of a tibial nerve injury is often not the motor loss, but the sensory loss over the sole. Patients must inspect their feet daily.
*   **Compartment Syndrome:** The deep posterior compartment is difficult to decompress; missed compartment syndrome here leads to severe clawing and sensory loss (variant of [[Volkmann's Ischemia]]).
