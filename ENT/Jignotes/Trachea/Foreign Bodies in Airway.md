# Foreign Bodies in Airway

A foreign body (FB) in the airway is a life-threatening emergency. It can lodge in the larynx, trachea, or bronchi depending on the size and shape of the object.

### Epidemiology and Etiology
*   **Age:** Most common in children between **1–4 years** of age.
*   **Most Common FB:** **Nuts/Peanuts** (vegetable matter) account for half of aspirations in children.
*   **Adults:** Usually accidental inhalation during alcoholic intoxication, sedation, or general anesthesia.
*   **Site of Impaction:**
    *   **Larynx/Supraglottic:** Large FBs that cannot pass the glottis.
    *   **Right Bronchus:** Most common site because it is **Wider, Shorter, and more Vertical** (in line with the trachea) than the left.
    *   **Left Bronchus:** Less common due to angulation.

**Types of Foreign Bodies:**
| Type | Characteristics | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vegetative (Organic)** | Irritating, toxic, and hygroscopic (absorb water and swell). Causes diffuse violent reaction ([[vegetal bronchitis]]). | Peanuts, seeds (watermelon, custard apple), beans. |
| **Non-vegetative (Inorganic)** | Inert, less irritating. May remain symptomless for a long time (latent). | Plastic, glass, coins, whistle, metallic pins. |

### Pathophysiology and Clinical Features
The symptomatology is classically divided into three stages:

**1. Initial Stage (Choking and Gagging)**
*   Sudden onset of choking, gagging, and paroxysmal coughing.
*   If the FB is large and obstructs the larynx completely, sudden death from asphyxia may occur.

**2. Second Stage (Symptomless Interval/Latent Phase)**
*   The respiratory mucosa adapts to the presence of the FB.
*   Initial symptoms subside, leading to a false sense of security.
*   This interval varies with the nature of the FB (shorter for vegetable FBs due to irritation).

**3. Third Stage (Late Symptoms/Complications)**
*   Symptoms recur due to obstruction, inflammation, or trauma.
*   Clinical presentation depends on the location:

#### A. Laryngeal Foreign Body
*   **Partial Obstruction:** Discomfort, pain, [[hoarseness]], croupy cough, [[aphonia]], dyspnea, and [[inspiratory stridor]].
*   **Complete Obstruction:** Cyanosis and death unless immediate resuscitation is performed.

#### B. Tracheal Foreign Body
*   **Audible Slap:** A loose FB moves up and down the trachea between the carina and vocal cords during respiration/coughing, producing a slapping sound.
*   **Palpatory Thud:** The impact of the loose FB can be palpated over the trachea.
*   **Asthmatoid Wheeze:** Audible at the patient's open mouth.

#### C. Bronchial Foreign Body
*   **Classic Triad:** Cough, [[wheeze]], and diminished air entry on the affected side.
*   **Mechanism of Obstruction:**
    *   **Bypass Valve:** Partial obstruction; air passes in and out (minimal symptoms).
    *   **Check Valve (Ball-valve):** Air enters during inspiration (bronchial dilation) but is trapped during expiration (bronchial collapse). Leads to **[[Obstructive Emphysema]]**.
    *   **Stop Valve:** Complete obstruction. Air cannot enter. Residual air is absorbed, leading to **[[Atelectasis]]** (Collapse).

### Diagnostic Evaluation

#### 1. History
*   A history of choking or coughing while eating is the most important diagnostic clue. A normal radiograph does not rule out an aspirated FB.
*   **Jackson's Dictum:** "All that wheezes is not asthma." Sudden onset of unilateral wheeze in a child should raise suspicion of FB.

#### 2. Radiology (X-rays)
*   **Views:** X-ray Soft Tissue Neck (Lateral and PA) and Chest X-ray (PA and Lateral).
*   **Radiopaque FB:** Coins, nails, pins are visible directly.
*   **Radiolucent FB:** Most vegetable FBs are not visible. Diagnosis relies on indirect signs:
    *   **Obstructive Emphysema:** Hyperinflation of the affected lung, mediastinal shift to the *opposite* side, and depressed diaphragm on the affected side.
    *   **Atelectasis:** Opacity of the lung, mediastinal shift to the *same* side, and raised diaphragm.
    *   **Inspiratory/Expiratory Films:** Expiratory films heighten the contrast between the trapped air (hyperinflated side) and the normal lung (deflated).

**Coin Orientation: Trachea vs. Esophagus**
Due to the anatomy of the vocal cords and tracheal rings (incomplete posteriorly), coins align differently:
*   **Trachea:** Appears **End-on (Linear)** in AP view; **Round (Flat)** in Lateral view.
*   **Esophagus:** Appears **Round (Flat)** in AP view; **End-on (Linear)** in Lateral view.

**Funny Mnemonic:**
*   **T**rachea = **T**hin (Linear) in AP view.
*   **E**sophagus = **E**normous (Round) in AP view.

#### 3. Other Imaging
*   **Fluoroscopy:** To observe mediastinal shift during respiration (Holzknecht sign).
*   **CT Scan/Virtual Bronchoscopy:** Useful if X-rays are inconclusive.

### Management

#### 1. First Aid (Emergency)
*   **Conscious Patient (Universal Choking Sign):**
    *   **Heimlich Maneuver:** Used for adults and children >1 year. Abdominal thrusts inward and upward to increase intrathoracic pressure and dislodge the FB.
    *   **Infants (<1 year):** Back blows and chest thrusts. Heimlich is contraindicated due to risk of liver injury.
*   **Unconscious Patient:** Start CPR. Finger sweep *only* if the object is visible.

#### 2. Emergency Surgical Airway
*   **[[Cricothyrotomy]] (Minitracheostomy):** Indicated in "Can't Intubate, Can't Oxygenate" (CICO) situations or total laryngeal obstruction where Heimlich fails.
*   **[[Tracheostomy]]:** May be required if cricothyrotomy is insufficient or for long-term management.

#### 3. Definitive Management: Bronchoscopy
**[[Rigid Bronchoscopy]]** is the **procedure of choice** for removal of airway foreign bodies.

*   **Anesthesia:** General anesthesia.
*   **Equipment:**
    *   Rigid bronchoscope (ventilating type).
    *   Optical forceps (for visualization and grasping).
    *   Dormia basket or Fogarty catheter (for rounded objects like beads).
*   **Technique:**
    *   The bronchoscope is introduced, and the airway is inspected.
    *   The FB is grasped and removed trailing the bronchoscope.
    *   Check bronchoscopy is done to rule out multiple FBs or residual fragments.

*   **Flexible Bronchoscopy:** Generally limited role in children or FB removal but can be used in selected adult cases or for diagnosis.

#### 4. Thoracotomy
*   Indicated only if endoscopic removal fails, or for peripherally impacted FBs.

### Complications
If the foreign body is not removed promptly, it can lead to:
*   **Laryngeal:** [[Laryngeal edema]], complete obstruction, death.
*   **Bronchial/Lung:**
    *   [[Pneumonia]] / Pneumonitis.
    *   [[Lung abscess]].
    *   [[Bronchiectasis]] (irreversible damage).
    *   Spontaneous [[Pneumothorax]] or [[Pneumomediastinum]].
