# [[Community Ophthalmology]] > National Programme for Control of Blindness

# [[National Programme for Control of Blindness and Visual Impairment]] (NPCB&VI)

### Introduction and Evolution
*   **Inception:** Launched in **1976** as a **100% Centrally Sponsored Scheme**.
*   **Status:** India was the first country in the world to launch a national program for blindness control.
*   **Name Change:** In 2017, the program was renamed to **National Programme for Control of Blindness and Visual Impairment (NPCB&VI)** to emphasize the importance of treating visual impairment (short of blindness) as well.
*   **Current Framework:** Currently implemented under the umbrella of the **[[National Health Mission]] (NHM)**.

### Objectives
The ultimate goal is to reduce the prevalence of **[[avoidable blindness]]**.
*   **Target:** To reduce the prevalence of avoidable blindness to **<0.25% by 2025**.
*   **Service Delivery:** To develop comprehensive eye-care facilities at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels.
*   **Human Resources:** To develop human resources for providing eye care services.
*   **Quality:** Improvement in the quality of service delivery (e.g., shifting from camp surgery to institutional surgery, and ECCE to IOL implantation).

### Definitions of Blindness and Visual Impairment
The definition was revised in 2017 to align with the WHO definition. This change drastically reduced the statistical burden of blindness in India (from ~12 million to ~8 million) by removing "economic blindness" from the "blindness" category.

| Category | Visual Acuity (in Better Eye with Best Correction) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Blindness]]** | Visual acuity **< 3/60** OR Visual field **< 10 degrees** |
| **Severe Visual Impairment** | Visual acuity < 6/60 to 3/60 |
| **Moderate Visual Impairment** | Visual acuity < 6/18 to 6/60 |
| **Early Visual Impairment** | Visual acuity < 6/12 to 6/18 |

**Clinical Implication:** Previously, blindness was defined as VA < 6/60. The new definition (<3/60) means patients with vision between 6/60 and 3/60 are now categorized under "Severe Visual Impairment" rather than "Blindness".

### Magnitude and Causes of Blindness in India
Based on the National Blindness & Visual Impairment Survey (2015-2019):
*   **Prevalence of Blindness:** **0.36%**.
*   **Principal Causes:**

| Rank | Cause | Percentage Contribution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **[[Cataract]]** | 66.2% (Most Common Cause) |
| 2 | **[[Corneal Opacity]]** | 7.4% |
| 3 | **[[Refractive Error]]** | ~7% (Varies by survey/age group) |
| 4 | **[[Glaucoma]]** | 5.8% |

### Organizational Structure
The program functions through a **Three-Tier System**:

#### 1. Central Level
*   **Body:** National Programme Management Cell in the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS).
*   **Role:** Policy making, planning, procurement of equipment, and grant-in-aid to NGOs.

#### 2. State Level
*   **Body:** State Ophthalmic Cell / State Health Society.
*   **Role:** Implementation at the state level, organizing training, and execution of civil works.

#### 3. District Level
*   **Body:** **[[District Blindness Control Society]] (DBCS)** (Now merged into District Health Society under NHM).
*   **Concept:** Decentralized planning and implementation.
*   **Functions:** Arranging eye camps, transporting patients, managing funds, and engaging NGOs.

### Implementation Strategies (Infrastructure Pyramid)
The program adopted the **[[Vision 2020: The Right to Sight]]** strategies to develop infrastructure based on population coverage.

| Level of Care | Facility Name | Target Population Ratio | Key Functions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Apex** | **[[Centre of Excellence]] (COE)** | 1 per 50 Million | Professional leadership, CME, Research, Advanced Tertiary care. |
| **Tertiary** | **[[Training Centre]]** | 1 per 5 Million | Medical colleges/RIOs. Training, Retina surgery, Corneal transplant. |
| **Secondary** | **[[Service Centre]]** | 1 per 500,000 | District Hospitals. Cataract surgery, Refraction, Referral services. |
| **Primary** | **[[Vision Centre]]** | 1 per 50,000 | Primary eye care, Refraction, School screening. Managed by Ophthalmic Assistant/Optometrist. |

### Target Diseases
The NPCB targets specific diseases identified under the "Vision 2020" initiative:
1.  **[[Cataract]]** (Major focus: Improving Cataract Surgical Rate - CSR).
2.  **Childhood Blindness.**
3.  **Refractive Errors & Low Vision.**
4.  **Corneal Blindness.**
5.  **[[Diabetic Retinopathy]].**
6.  **Glaucoma.**
7.  **[[Trachoma]]** (Focal control).

**Mnemonic for Targets:** **C**ats **R**un **D**own **T**he **G**reen **C**orridor (**C**ataract, **R**efractive, **D**iabetic Retinopathy, **T**rachoma, **G**laucoma, **C**hildhood/Corneal blindness).

### Key Activities and Initiatives

#### 1. School Eye Screening Programme
*   **Target:** Primary and Middle school children (approx. 5-14 years).
*   **Methodology:**
    1.  **Initial Screening:** Done by trained **Teachers** using vision screening cards.
    2.  **Confirmation:** Children with VA < 6/9 are referred to Ophthalmic Assistants/Vision Centres.
    3.  **Correction:** Provision of free spectacles.

#### 2. Cataract Operations
*   Shift from camp-based surgeries to **institutional surgeries** (Base Hospital Approach) to improve quality and reduce infection rates.
*   Emphasis on **[[Intraocular Lens]] (IOL)** implantation rather than conventional surgery.

#### 3. Collection and Utilization of Donated Eyes
*   Observance of **National Eye Donation Fortnight** (25th August to 8th September).
*   Establishment of Eye Banks and Eye Donation Centres.
*   **Hospital Cornea Retrieval Programme (HCRP):** Focus on retrieving corneas from hospital deaths to improve tissue quality.

#### 4. New Initiatives (12th Five-Year Plan & Beyond)
*   **Free Spectacles for Near Work:** Provided to elderly persons (BPL category) suffering from [[presbyopia]].
*   **Tele-ophthalmology:** Setting up networks connecting Vision Centres to expert consults.
*   **Multipurpose District Mobile Ophthalmic Units:** To expand coverage in remote/hilly areas.
*   **Fixed Day Strategy:** For eye care services at PHC/CHC levels.
