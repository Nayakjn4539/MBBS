# [[Man And Medicine: Towards Health For All]] > Concept of Health for All and Primary Health Care

### **Concept of Health For All (HFA)**

**Background and Origin**
*   In May 1977, the **30th World Health Assembly** resolved that the main social target of governments and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) in the coming decades should be the attainment of **Health for All by the year 2000**.
*   This movement arose from the realization of gross inequalities in health status between developed and developing countries, and between rich and poor within nations.

**Definition and Meaning**
*   **Definition:** "The attainment by all citizens of the world by the year 2000 of a level of health that will permit them to lead a **socially and economically productive life**.",
*   **Core Principle:** **Equity**. It implies an equal health status for people and countries, ensured by an equitable distribution of health resources.
*   **Scope:** HFA is a **holistic concept**. It is not limited to the health sector but calls for efforts in agriculture, industry, education, housing, and communications.

**Interpretation (What HFA is NOT)**
*   It does **not** mean that everyone will be free of disease or disability (which is unrealistic).
*   It does **not** mean that doctors and nurses will take care of everyone.

**Interpretation (What HFA IS)**
*   It means health is brought within reach of everyone in the community.
*   It implies the removal of obstacles to health (e.g., [[Malnutrition]], ignorance, contaminated water, unhygienic housing).
*   It means people will have the ability to work productively and participate actively in the social life of their community.

### **Primary Health Care (PHC)**

**Context**
*   In **1978**, the International Conference on Primary Health Care at **[[Alma-Ata]]** (USSR) declared that **Primary Health Care** is the key to attaining the goal of Health for All.,
*   It represents a shift from "Health care **for** the people" to "**Health by the people**".

**Definition of Primary Health Care**
"Essential health care based on **practical**, **scientifically sound** and **socially acceptable** methods and technology made **universally accessible** to individuals and families in the community through their **full participation** and at a cost that the community and country can **afford** to maintain at every stage of their development in the spirit of **self-reliance** and self-determination.",

**Attributes of PHC**
1.  **First Level of Contact:** It brings health care as close as possible to where people live and work.
2.  **Integral Part:** It is part of the country’s health system and the overall social and economic development.

### **Elements of Primary Health Care**

The Alma-Ata Declaration outlined **8 essential components** of PHC.

**Mnemonic: ELEMENTS**,

| Letter | Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **E** | **E**ducation | Concerning prevailing health problems and methods of preventing/controlling them. |
| **L** | **L**ocally Endemic Diseases | Prevention and control of locally endemic diseases (e.g., [[Malaria]], TB). |
| **E** | **E**ssential Drugs | Provision of essential drugs. |
| **M** | **M**aternal & Child Health | Maternal and child health care, including [[Family Planning]]. |
| **E** | **E**PI (Immunization) | Immunization against major infectious diseases. |
| **N** | **N**utrition | Promotion of food supply and proper nutrition. |
| **T** | **T**reatment | Appropriate treatment of common diseases and injuries. |
| **S** | **S**afe Water & Sanitation | Adequate supply of safe water and basic sanitation. |

### **Principles of Primary Health Care**

To be effective, PHC must adhere to four pillars or principles.

**1. Equitable Distribution**
*   Health services must be shared equally by all people irrespective of their ability to pay (rich or poor, urban or rural).
*   **Current Issue:** Health services are often concentrated in urban areas (social injustice).
*   **Goal:** Shift the center of gravity of the health system from cities to rural areas and urban slums to reach the "social periphery".

**2. Community Participation**
*   Involvement of individuals, families, and communities in promoting their own health and welfare.
*   The community should be involved in planning, implementation, and maintenance of health services.
*   **Example:** Use of [[Village Health Guides]], [[ASHA]], and trained Dais helps bridge the cultural and communication gap.

**3. Intersectoral Coordination**
*   Health cannot be improved by the health sector alone.
*   Requires coordination with related sectors: **Agriculture**, **Animal Husbandry**, **Food**, **Industry**, **Education**, **Housing**, **Public Works**.
*   **Rationale:** Improvement in these sectors (e.g., better water supply or food production) directly impacts health status.

**4. Appropriate Technology**
*   Technology that is:
    *   **Scientifically sound.**
    *   **Adaptable** to local needs.
    *   **Acceptable** to those who apply it and those for whom it is used.
    *   **Affordable** and maintainable by the people themselves.
*   **Examples:** Use of [[Oral Rehydration Fluid]] instead of expensive IV fluids for mild dehydration; Standpipes for water instead of house-to-house connections if funds are low.

### **Levels of Health Care**

Health services are organized into three tiers to ensure efficient delivery.

**1. Primary Care Level**
*   **Definition:** First level of contact between the individual and the health system.
*   **Services:** "Essential" health care. Most health problems are dealt with here.
*   **Infrastructure in India:** [[Sub-centre]] and [[Primary Health Centre]] (PHC).
*   **Personnel:** MPWs, ANMs, ASHA, Anganwadi workers.

**2. Secondary Care Level**,
*   **Definition:** Intermediate level dealing with more complex problems.
*   **Function:** Serves as the **First Referral Level**.
*   **Infrastructure in India:** [[Community Health Centre]] (CHC) and District Hospitals.
*   **Services:** Curative services provided by specialists (Medicine, Surgery, OBG, Pediatrics).

**3. Tertiary Care Level**,
*   **Definition:** Specialized and super-specialized care.
*   **Function:** Planning, managerial skills, and teaching/training.
*   **Infrastructure in India:** Medical Colleges, Regional Hospitals, Specialized Institutes (e.g., AIIMS).
