# [[General Orthopaedics]] > Prostheses in Orthopedics

### Definition and Classification

A [[Prosthesis]] is an artificial device used to replace a whole or a part of a missing extremity or body structure either externally or internally. 

**Distinction from other devices:**
*   **Prosthesis vs. Implant:** An [[Implant]] (e.g., plate, nail) acts as a temporary internal splint for fracture healing and has no role after union. A prosthesis is designed for permanent replacement.
*   **Prosthesis vs. Orthosis:** A prosthesis replaces normal anatomy (e.g., artificial leg), whereas an [[Orthosis]] supports or corrects existing anatomy (e.g., splint, brace).

**Broad Classification:**
1.  **Internal Prostheses (Endoprostheses):** Used in [[Arthroplasty]] to replace damaged joint components (e.g., Hip, Knee).
2.  **External Prostheses (Exoprostheses):** Artificial limbs used following [[Amputation]].

### Internal Prostheses (Joint Replacement)

Internal prostheses are used to reconstruct joints damaged by trauma, osteoarthritis, or tumors.

#### 1. Hemiarthroplasty Prostheses
These replace only one component of the joint, typically the femoral head in the hip.

**A. Austin Moore Prosthesis (AMP)**
*   **Design:** A metallic unipolar prosthesis with a spherical head and a stem.
*   **Key Feature:** The stem contains **fenestrations** (holes).
*   **Mechanism:** It is an **uncemented** prosthesis. Bone grows into the fenestrations (self-locking mechanism) to provide stability.
*   **Indication:** [[Fracture Neck of Femur]] in elderly patients where the **calcar femorale** is sufficient/intact.

**B. Thompson Prosthesis**
*   **Design:** Similar to AMP but has a solid stem without fenestrations.
*   **Mechanism:** It requires **[[Bone Cement]]** (Polymethylmethacrylate - PMMA) for fixation.
*   **Indication:** Fracture neck of femur where the **calcar femorale** is deficient or the canal is very wide (osteoporotic).

**C. Bipolar Prosthesis**
*   **Design:** Consists of a metallic stem and a head that articulates within a polyethylene-lined outer metallic shell.
*   **Mechanism:** Movement occurs at two interfaces:
    1.  Between the prosthetic head and the inner polyethylene liner.
    2.  Between the outer metallic shell and the patient's acetabulum.
*   **Advantage:** Reduces erosion of the acetabulum compared to unipolar prostheses.

**Comparison Table: Austin Moore vs. Thompson Prosthesis**

| Feature | Austin Moore Prosthesis (AMP) | Thompson Prosthesis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stem Design** | Fenestrated (Holes present) | Solid (No holes) |
| **Neck** | Present | Absent |
| **Collar** | Present (Rests on Calcar) | Absent |
| **Fixation** | Uncemented (Self-locking) | Cemented (PMMA) |
| **Indication** | Sufficient Calcar | Deficient Calcar |

#### 2. Total Joint Replacement (TJR)
Replaces both components of a joint (e.g., Femoral head + Acetabulum in Hip; Femoral condyles + Tibial plateau in Knee).

*   **Total Hip Replacement (THR):**
    *   **Components:** Femoral stem, Modular Head (Metal/Ceramic), Acetabular Cup (Polyethylene/Metal/Ceramic).
    *   **Fixation:** Can be cemented or uncemented (press-fit with hydroxyapatite coating).
*   **Total Knee Replacement (TKR):**
    *   **Components:** Femoral component (Metal), Tibial base plate (Metal), Tibial insert (Polyethylene), and optional Patellar button.
    *   **Goal:** Resurfacing the joint to achieve optimal alignment and soft tissue balance.

#### 3. Fixation Methods
*   **Cemented:** Uses **[[Polymethylmethacrylate]] (PMMA)**. Acts as a grout (filler) to interlock the prosthesis with bone trabeculae. It is *not* a glue. Preferred in elderly/osteoporotic bone.
*   **Uncemented (Press-fit):** Relies on "scratch fit" initially and **osseointegration** (bone ingrowth) into the porous surface of the implant later. Often coated with **Hydroxyapatite**. Preferred in younger patients with good bone stock.

### External Prostheses (Artificial Limbs)

Used for rehabilitation after amputation. Ideally fitted early to improve acceptance.

#### Components
1.  **Socket:** The part that interfaces with the residual limb (stump).
2.  **Suspension:** Holds the prosthesis on the limb (e.g., suction, straps).
3.  **Terminal Device:** Replaces the hand or foot (e.g., SACH foot, split hook).

#### Types of Prosthetic Feet

**1. SACH Foot (Solid Ankle Cushion Heel)**
*   **Structure:** Wooden keel surrounded by solid rubber. Contains a compressible heel wedge.
*   **Function:** Simulates plantar flexion at heel strike by compressing the heel wedge.
*   **Drawback:** Does not allow active dorsiflexion, inversion, or eversion. Not suitable for uneven ground.

**2. Jaipur Foot**
*   **Origin:** Developed in Jaipur, India (Dr. P.K. Sethi).
*   **Structure:** Made of rubber with microcellular rubber (MCR) blocks. Cosmetic appearance resembles a natural foot.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Allows **squatting** and sitting cross-legged (essential for Indian lifestyle).
    *   Allows walking on uneven terrain and barefoot walking.
    *   Water-resistant and durable.

**Comparison: SACH Foot vs. Jaipur Foot**

| Feature | SACH Foot | Jaipur Foot |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Material** | Wooden keel, solid rubber | Rubber, MCR, wooden block |
| **Ankle Motion** | Rigid (Solid ankle) | Flexible (Allows movement) |
| **Appearance** | Does not look natural | Looks like a natural foot |
| **Squatting** | Not possible | Possible |
| **Walking** | Shoe is essential | Can walk barefoot |
| **Terrain** | Flat surfaces only | Uneven surfaces allowed |

### Biomaterials in Orthopedics

Implants and prostheses must be biocompatible, nontoxic, and corrosion-resistant.

*   **Stainless Steel (316L):** Rigid, used for temporary implants (plates/screws). Not used for permanent prostheses due to corrosion risk.
*   **Cobalt-Chrome Alloys:** High strength, used for joint replacement bearing surfaces.
*   **Titanium Alloys:**
    *   Modulus of elasticity closest to bone (reduces stress shielding).
    *   Best biocompatibility (osseointegration).
    *   MRI compatible.
*   **Polyethylene (UHMWPE):** Ultra-High Molecular Weight Polyethylene. Used for acetabular cups and tibial inserts. Prone to wear debris (osteolysis).
*   **Ceramics:** Low wear rates, used in young patients. Risk of squeaking or fracture.

---

### Clinical Implications

*   **MRI Compatibility:** Titanium implants allow postoperative MRI scanning. Stainless steel causes artifacts and is contraindicated.
*   **Infection:** Deep infection around a prosthesis (Periprosthetic Joint Infection) creates a biofilm that antibiotics cannot penetrate. Often requires removal of the prosthesis.
*   **Loosening:** "Aseptic loosening" is the most common cause of long-term failure, often due to osteolysis caused by polyethylene wear particles.

### Mnemonics
*   **Moore** has **M**any holes (Fenestrated stem).
*   **Th**ompson is **Th**ick (Solid stem) and needs **Th**ement (Cement).
*   **SACH**: **S**olid **A**nkle **C**ushion **H**eel.
