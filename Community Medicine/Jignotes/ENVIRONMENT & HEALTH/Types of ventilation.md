# [[ENVIRONMENT & HEALTH]] > Types of ventilation

### **Types of Ventilation**

Ventilation is defined as the replacement of [[vitiated air]] inside a room with fresh outdoor air, along with the control of the quality of incoming air regarding temperature, humidity, and purity.

It is broadly classified into two main types:
1.  **Natural Ventilation**
2.  **Mechanical (Artificial) Ventilation**

---

### **1. Natural Ventilation**
This is the simplest system used in small dwellings, schools, and offices. It relies on three natural forces:

**A. Wind**
Wind is an active force in ventilation. It acts through two mechanisms:
*   **Perflation:** When wind blows *through* a room, it is called [[perflation]]. If there are windows and doors facing each other, it provides **Cross-Ventilation**. Back-to-back houses are banned because they do not permit cross-ventilation.
*   **Aspiration:** When wind bypasses an obstruction (like a building), it exerts a suction action at its tail end, extracting air from the room. This is called [[aspiration]].

**B. Diffusion**
*   Air passes through the smallest openings, crevices, or spaces by diffusion.
*   This is a slow process and cannot be relied upon as the sole means of ventilation.

**C. Inequality of Temperature**
*   Air flows from high density to low density.
*   **Mechanism:** Indoor air gets heated, expands, becomes lighter (less dense), and rises to escape through openings/ventilators high up. Cooler, denser outside air enters through inlets placed low.
*   The greater the temperature difference, the greater the velocity of incoming air.

### **2. Mechanical (Artificial) Ventilation**
Used when natural ventilation is insufficient or needs specific control.

**A. Exhaust (Vacuum) System**
*   **Mechanism:** Air is extracted/exhausted to the outside by electric exhaust fans.
*   **Pressure:** Creates a **negative pressure** (vacuum) inside the room.
*   **Effect:** Fresh air is induced to enter through windows/doors to fill the vacuum.
*   **Application:** Large halls, auditoria, and industries to remove dust/fumes at the source.

**B. Plenum (Propulsion) System**
*   **Mechanism:** Fresh air is *blown into* the room by centrifugal fans/blowers.
*   **Pressure:** Creates a **positive pressure** inside the room.
*   **Effect:** Vitiated air is displaced and forced out.
*   **Application:** Air-conditioned buildings, factories, and sterile areas.

**C. Balanced System**
*   **Mechanism:** A combination of the **Exhaust** and **Plenum** systems.
*   **Action:** The blowing fan must balance the exhaust fan.
*   **Note:** When this system is used, natural ventilation is entirely dispensed with.

**D. Air Conditioning**
*   **Definition:** The simultaneous control of all (or at least the first three) of the following factors within a confined space:
    1.  **Temperature**
    2.  **Humidity**
    3.  **Air movement**
    4.  Distribution
    5.  Dust
    6.  Bacteria
    7.  Odors
    8.  Toxic gases
*   **Process:** Air is filtered, excess humidity removed (or added), heated/cooled to the desired temperature, and circulated.
*   **Transition Room:** In places with large temperature differences (outside vs inside), a transition room is provided to prevent sudden exposure to extreme temperatures.

### **Comparison of Ventilation Types**

| Feature | Exhaust System | Plenum System | Balanced System |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mechanism** | Extracts air out | Blows air in | Both blow in and extract |
| **Pressure** | Negative (Vacuum) | Positive | Balanced |
| **Air Entry** | Through random gaps/inlets | Controlled ducts | Controlled ducts |
| **Best Use** | Removal of odors/fumes/dust | Sterile areas, AC buildings | Large closed halls |

### **Standards of Ventilation**
*   **Cubic Space:** Fresh air supply of **3000 cu. ft.** per hour per person.
*   **Air Change:**
    *   Living rooms: **2–3** changes per hour.
    *   Workrooms/Assemblies: **4–6** changes per hour.
*   **Floor Space:** Minimum **50–100 sq. ft.** per person.

### **Mnemonics**

*   **Natural Ventilation:** **WID**e open windows.
    *   **W**ind
    *   **I**nequality of temperature
    *   **D**iffusion

*   **Mechanical Ventilation:** **PEBA** (Like a pebble).
    *   **P**lenum
    *   **E**xhaust
    *   **B**alanced
    *   **A**ir Conditioning

### **Clinical Relevance**
*   **[[Droplet Infection]]:** Poor ventilation increases the risk of respiratory infections like Tuberculosis, Influenza, and COVID-19.
*   **Sick Building Syndrome:** Caused by poor mechanical ventilation systems recirculating pathogens or allergens.
*   **Discomfort:** Physical changes in air (heat stagnation) cause discomfort in ill-ventilated rooms, not just lack of oxygen (Leonard Hill’s experiment).
