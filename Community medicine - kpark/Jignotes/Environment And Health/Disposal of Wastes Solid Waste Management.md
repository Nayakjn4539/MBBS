# [[Environment And Health]] > Disposal of Wastes Solid Waste Management

### Solid Waste Management: Disposal of Wastes

**Definition and Classification**
The term [[Refuse]] or Solid Waste applies to all solid waste from human habitations that is *not* carried by sewers (i.e., excludes night soil/human excreta and sullage).

*   **Garbage:** Waste from food processing, cooking, and serving (organic, fermentable).
*   **Rubbish:** Paper, cardboard, plastics, wood, glass, dust (combustible or non-combustible).
*   **Ash:** Residue from burning fuel.
*   **Industrial Refuse:** Toxic or inert material from factories,.

**Health Hazards of Improper Disposal**
Accumulation of solid waste poses significant public health risks,:
1.  **Vector Breeding:** Favors breeding of [[flies]] (vectors for typhoid, cholera) and mosquitoes (Aedes in artificial water collections).
2.  **Rodent Harborage:** Attracts rats, increasing risk of plague, salmonellosis, and leptospirosis.
3.  **Pollution:**
    *   **Water:** Rainwater percolating through dumps produces [[Leachate]], a highly toxic liquid that pollutes groundwater and surface water.
    *   **Air:** Burning refuse causes air pollution.
    *   **Soil:** Contamination with pathogens and chemicals.
4.  **Nuisance:** Unsightly appearance and bad odors.

### Methods of Disposal

There is no single "best" method; the choice depends on land availability, cost, and waste composition.

#### 1. Dumping (Open Dumping)
*   **Method:** Refuse is simply dumped in low-lying areas.
*   **Status:** **Insanitary method.**
*   **Drawbacks:** Exposed to flies/rodents, nuisance smell, wind dispersal, and potential for fire and water pollution. It is condemned by public health experts.

#### 2. Sanitary Landfill / Controlled Tipping
*   **Definition:** The most satisfactory method where suitable land is available. Refuse is deposited, compacted, and covered with earth daily.
*   **Methods of Operation:**
    1.  **Trench Method:** Used in level ground. Trenches are dug, filled, and covered.
    2.  **Ramp Method:** Used in moderately sloping terrain.
    3.  **Area Method:** Used for filling land depressions (quarries/pits).
*   **Changes in Refuse:**
    *   **Bacteriological:** Temperature rises to **>60°C** within 7 days (killing pathogens) due to aerobic bacterial action, followed by anaerobic decomposition.
    *   **Chemical:** Organic matter decomposes into innocent mass (humus) in **4–6 months**.
    *   **Physical:** Refuse settles and compacts.

#### 3. Incineration
*   **Process:** High-temperature dry oxidation process.
*   **Mechanism:** Reduces waste volume and weight considerably.
*   **Indication:** Best for **[[Biomedical Waste]]** (hospital refuse) which is dangerous.
*   **Drawback:** Very expensive and not suitable if waste contains high ash/dust content (common in Indian refuse).

#### 4. Composting
*   **Definition:** Combined disposal of refuse and night soil (human excreta) or sludge.
*   **Principle:** Nature's process where organic matter breaks down under bacterial action to form **Humus** (manure).
*   **By-products:** Heat (kills pathogens), $CO_2$, and Water.

**Methods of Composting:**

| Feature | **Bangalore Method** (Hot Fermentation) | **Indore Method** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Process** | **Anaerobic** decomposition | **Aerobic** decomposition |
| **Procedure** | Alternate layers of refuse and night soil. Sealed with earth. | Refuse and night soil mixed and **turned** regularly. |
| **Turning** | **No turning** required. | Turned on 4-7th day, then after 5-10 days. |
| **Duration** | Longer (**4–6 months**) | Shorter (**4–6 weeks**) |
| **Suitability** | Recommended for towns/cities in India. | Less popular due to labor intensity. |
| **Hygienic Status** | cleaner (less fly breeding). | potential fly nuisance if not managed well. |

> **Mnemonic for Composting:**
> *   **BAR:** **B**angalore is **A**naerobic and **R**ecommended.
> *   **IA:** **I**ndore is **A**erobic (requires Air/turning).

#### 5. Manure Pits
*   **Target Group:** Individual householders in **[[Rural Areas]]**.
*   **Process:** Garbage, cattle dung, straw dumped into pits and covered with earth daily.
*   **Outcome:** Converted to manure in 5–6 months.

#### 6. Burial
*   **Target Group:** Small **camps** (e.g., temporary settlements).
*   **Process:** Trench 1.5m wide, 2m deep. Refuse covered with 20-30 cm earth daily.
*   **Calculation:** A trench of 1m length is filled by 200 persons in one week.

### Public Health Importance
Proper solid waste management breaks the chain of disease transmission (Sanitation Barrier concept). In India, mechanical composting and sanitary landfills are increasingly encouraged over open dumping to prevent [[Soil Pollution]] and vector-borne diseases.
