# Surgical Techniques for Cataract Extraction

The management of [[Cataract]] is primarily surgical. The goal is to remove the opacified [[Crystalline Lens]] and rehabilitate vision, usually via the implantation of an [[Intraocular Lens]] (IOL). Surgical techniques have evolved from removing the entire lens with its capsule to microsurgical techniques that remove the lens substance while preserving the capsule.

## Classification of Cataract Surgeries

The two broad categories of cataract surgery are:

1.  **Intracapsular Cataract Extraction ([[ICCE]]):** Removal of the entire lens along with its capsule.
2.  **Extracapsular Cataract Extraction ([[ECCE]]):** Removal of the lens nucleus and cortex, leaving the posterior capsule intact.

### 1. Intracapsular Cataract Extraction (ICCE)

*   **Definition:** Removal of the entire cataractous lens along with the intact capsule by rupturing the zonules.
*   **Current Status:** Largely obsolete; replaced by planned extracapsular techniques.
*   **Indications:**
    *   Markedly subluxated or dislocated lens.
    *   When zonular dialysis is extensive (>180°).
*   **Technique:**
    *   Large limbal incision (150°).
    *   Peripheral [[Iridectomy]].
    *   Lens delivery via **Cryoextraction** (freezing the lens with a cryoprobe) or Capsule forceps/Smith’s tumbling method.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   High risk of [[Vitreous Loss]].
    *   High postoperative [[Astigmatism]].
    *   Cannot implant a [[Posterior Chamber IOL]] (PC-IOL); requires Anterior Chamber IOL (AC-IOL) or Iris-claw lens.
    *   Higher incidence of [[Cystoid Macular Edema]] (CME) and [[Retinal Detachment]].

### 2. Extracapsular Cataract Extraction (ECCE) Techniques

ECCE is the standard of care. It maintains the posterior capsule, which supports a PC-IOL and prevents vitreous prolapse.

#### A. Conventional ECCE
*   **Incision:** Large limbal incision (10–12 mm).
*   **Sutures:** Requires multiple sutures (3–5 sutures of 10-0 nylon).
*   **Capsulotomy:** Usually "Can-opener" technique or linear envelope technique.
*   **Nucleus Removal:** Delivered manually using pressure and counter-pressure or an irrigating wire vectis.
*   **Drawbacks:** High surgically induced astigmatism (SIA), suture-related complications, and delayed visual rehabilitation (6–8 weeks).

#### B. Manual Small Incision Cataract Surgery ([[SICS]])
A low-cost, high-volume alternative to Phacoemulsification, widely used in developing countries.
*   **Incision:** Self-sealing valvular **sclerocorneal tunnel** incision.
    *   Length: 5.5–7.5 mm (depending on nucleus hardness).
    *   Location: 1.5–2 mm behind the limbus.
*   **Sutures:** usually Sutureless due to the self-sealing valve effect.
*   **Capsulotomy:** Large Continuous Curvilinear Capsulorhexis ([[CCC]]) or Can-opener.
*   **Nucleus Removal:**
    *   **Hydrodissection:** Essential to separate cortex from capsule.
    *   **Prolapse:** Nucleus is prolapsed into the Anterior Chamber (AC).
    *   **Delivery:** Using **Viscoexpression** (viscoelastic pressure), Irrigating wire vectis, or Fishhook technique.
*   **Advantages:** Universal applicability (even for very hard cataracts), not machine-dependent, cost-effective, less astigmatism than conventional ECCE.

#### C. Phacoemulsification ([[Phaco]])
The gold standard worldwide.
*   **Principle:** Use of a piezoelectric crystal in the handpiece to convert electrical energy into mechanical ultrasonic energy (40,000 Hz) to emulsify the nucleus.
*   **Incision:** Small **Clear Corneal Incision** or Scleral tunnel (1.8 mm – 3.2 mm).
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Side Port:** For instruments/choppers.
    2.  **Capsulorhexis (CCC):** Crucial for bag stability.
    3.  **Hydrodissection/Hydrodelineation:** To mobilize the nucleus.
    4.  **Nuclear Management:** Techniques include *Divide and Conquer*, *Stop and Chop*, or *Direct Phaco Chop*.
    5.  **Cortical Aspiration:** Automated I/A probe.
    6.  **IOL Implantation:** Foldable IOL (Acrylic/Silicone) injected through the small incision.
*   **Advantages:** Topical anesthesia, no sutures, minimal astigmatism, rapid visual rehabilitation, "quiet" eye post-op.
*   **Disadvantages:** Learning curve, machine dependency, high cost, risk of nucleus drop.

#### D. Femtosecond Laser-Assisted Cataract Surgery ([[FLACS]])
Uses a **Femtosecond Laser** (Nd:Glass, 1053 nm wavelength, photodisruption principle) to automate key steps.
*   **Automated Steps:**
    1.  Corneal incisions (Main and Side-port).
    2.  Anterior Capsulotomy (Perfectly circular and centered).
    3.  Nuclear Fragmentation (Pre-softening the lens).
    4.  Astigmatic Keratotomy (Arcuate incisions).
*   **Pros:** Precision, reduced ultrasound energy requirement, reproducibility.
*   **Cons:** High cost.

### Other Techniques and Concepts

#### 1. Lensectomy
*   Used primarily for **Pediatric Cataracts** or complicated cases.
*   **Technique:** Pars Plana approach using a vitreous cutter to remove the lens and anterior vitreous.
*   **Indication:** Children < 2 years, subluxated lenses.

#### 2. Refractive Lens Exchange ([[RLE]])
*   Removal of a clear crystalline lens to correct high refractive errors (High Myopia/Hypermetropia).
*   Risk: Higher risk of **Retinal Detachment** in high myopes.

#### 3. Phaco-nit / MICS (Micro-Incision Cataract Surgery)
*   Incision size < 1.8 mm (Phaconit ~ 0.9 mm).
*   Uses specific "Rollable IOLs".

### Intraocular Lenses ([[IOL]])
The calculation of IOL power is called **Biometry**.
*   **Formula:** $P = A - 2.5L - 0.9K$ (SRK Formula).
    *   $P$ = Power of IOL.
    *   $A$ = Constant (Specific to lens).
    *   $L$ = Axial Length (measured by A-scan USG or Optical Biometry).
    *   $K$ = Keratometry (Corneal curvature).
*   **Types:**
    *   **PC-IOL:** Posterior Chamber (in the bag - most physiological).
    *   **AC-IOL:** Anterior Chamber (in front of iris - used if capsule support is lost).
    *   **Toric IOL:** Corrects astigmatism.
    *   **Multifocal/Accommodative IOL:** Corrects presbyopia.

### Complications of Surgery (Brief Overview)

*   **Operative:** Posterior Capsule Rupture ([[PCR]]), Vitreous Loss, [[Expulsive Hemorrhage]] (from posterior ciliary arteries).
*   **Early Post-op:** [[Endophthalmitis]] (Acute), Striate Keratopathy, Hyphema, Iris Prolapse.
*   **Late Post-op:**
    *   **Posterior Capsular Opacification ([[PCO]]):** Most common late complication. Treated with **Nd:YAG Laser Capsulotomy**.
    *   **Cystoid Macular Edema (Irvine-Gass Syndrome):** Peak at 6-10 weeks.
    *   **Pseudophakic Bullous Keratopathy (PBK):** Due to endothelial damage.
