# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Vaccines for prevention of rabies

### Vaccines for Prevention of Rabies

**[Context: COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]**

Rabies is a zoonotic viral disease that is almost always fatal once symptoms appear. Prevention relies heavily on [[Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)]] and, in high-risk groups, [[Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)]]. Modern management utilizes **Cell Culture Vaccines (CCVs)** and **Rabies Immunoglobulins (RIG)**.

### **1. Classification of Rabies Vaccines**

Historically, vaccines were derived from nervous tissue, but these have largely been replaced due to neuroparalytic complications.

| **Category** | **Examples** | **Status** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nervous Tissue Vaccines** | Semple’s sheep brain vaccine, Suckling mouse brain vaccine | **Discontinued** in India (since 2004) due to side effects (Neuroparalytic accidents),. |
| **Duck Embryo Vaccines** | Crude DEV (Obsolete), **Purified Duck Embryo Vaccine (PDEV)** | PDEV is safe, immunogenic, and currently available. |
| **Cell Culture Vaccines (CCV)** | **Human Diploid Cell Vaccine (HDCV)**<br>**Purified Chick Embryo Cell Vaccine (PCECV)**<br>**Purified Vero Cell Rabies Vaccine (PVRV)** | **Gold Standard.** Safe, highly potent, and widely used,. |

> **Potency Requirement:** All modern vaccines (CCEEVs) must have a potency of **≥ 2.5 International Units (IU)** per single intramuscular dose,.

### **2. Immunization Schedules**

There are two main routes of administration for modern vaccines: **Intramuscular (IM)** and **Intradermal (ID)**.

#### **A. Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)**
Used for **Category II** (minor scratches, no bleeding) and **Category III** (transdermal bites, bleeding, mucosal contact) exposures.

**1. Intramuscular (IM) Regimens**
Injected into the **Deltoid** region (adults) or **Anterolateral thigh** (infants/children). *Never in the gluteal region (buttocks)* as fat absorption is poor,.

*   **Essen Regimen (5-Dose Schedule):**
    *   **Doses:** 1 dose on each visit.
    *   **Days:** **0, 3, 7, 14, 28**,.
    *   **Mnemonic:** *"Month has 28 days"* (0, 3, 7, 14, 28).

*   **Zagreb Regimen (Abbreviated Multisite / 2-1-1 Schedule):**
    *   **Doses:** 4 doses in 3 visits.
    *   **Day 0:** 2 doses (one in each deltoid).
    *   **Day 7:** 1 dose.
    *   **Day 21:** 1 dose,.

**2. Intradermal (ID) Regimen**
Cost-effective vaccine-saving method (uses 0.1 mL per site). Requires specific vaccines approved for ID use (e.g., PVRV, PCECV).

*   **Updated Thai Red Cross Regimen (2-2-2-0-2):**
    *   **Site:** 2 sites (usually deltoids).
    *   **Dose:** **0.1 mL** per site.
    *   **Days:** **0, 3, 7, 28**,.
    *   **Visits:** 4 visits total.

> **Clinical Relevance:** The ID dose (0.1 mL) is significantly less than the IM dose (0.5 or 1.0 mL), making it economical for public health programs,.

#### **B. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)**
Recommended for high-risk groups (Veterinarians, dog handlers, lab workers, travelers to endemic areas).

*   **Schedule:** 3 doses.
*   **Days:** **0, 7, and 21 (or 28)**,.
*   **Booster:** Recommended only if antibody titer falls below 0.5 IU/mL (checked every 6 months to 2 years for professionals),.

#### **C. Re-Exposure Prophylaxis**
For individuals with documented **complete previous immunization** (Pre or Post-exposure).

*   **Treatment:** Only **2 doses** of vaccine.
*   **Days:** **0 and 3**,.
*   **RIG:** **NOT** indicated,.

---

### **3. Passive Immunization: Rabies Immunoglobulins (RIG)**

RIG provides immediate antibodies (passive immunity) to neutralize the virus at the wound site before the vaccine-induced active immunity kicks in (which takes ~7 days).

*   **Indication:** All **Category III** bites and Category II bites in immunocompromised patients,.
*   **Timing:** Administer as soon as possible (Day 0). Not recommended after **Day 7** of the first vaccine dose (as active antibodies are formed by then).

| **Type** | **Dose** | **Remarks** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Human RIG (HRIG)** | **20 IU/kg** | Safe, no serum sickness, expensive,. |
| **Equine RIG (ERIG)** | **40 IU/kg** | Cheaper, risk of serum sickness (sensitivity test required),. |

> **Administration Rule:** Infiltrate **maximum possible amount** into and around the wound. Any remaining volume is given IM at a site distant from the vaccine (gluteal),.

---

### **4. Storage and Cold Chain**

*   **Storage Temperature:** **+2°C to +8°C**,.
*   **Freeze Sensitivity:** Modern vaccines are freeze-dried (lyophilized) but liquid forms or diluents should not be frozen.
*   **Reconstitution:** Use the provided sterile diluent. Once reconstituted, use immediately or within **6-8 hours**.

---

### **5. Important Clinical Points**

*   **Wound Management:** Immediate flushing with soap and water for **10-15 minutes** reduces viral load by up to 80%,.
*   **Suturing:** Avoid if possible. If necessary, loose sutures should be applied only *after* infiltrating RIG,.
*   **Contraindications:** There are **NO contraindications** to post-exposure prophylaxis (including pregnancy and infancy) because rabies is fatal,.
*   **Observation:** Domestic dogs/cats can be observed for **10 days**. If the animal remains healthy, PEP can be discontinued,.

---

### **Summary of Schedules (Mnemonic)**

*   **PEP (IM - Essen):** **"Month has 28 days"** $\rightarrow$ **0, 3, 7, 14, 28**.
*   **PEP (ID - Thai):** **"2 sites x 4 visits"** $\rightarrow$ **0, 3, 7, 28**.
*   **PrEP:** **"Weekly intervals"** $\rightarrow$ **0, 7, 21 (or 28)**.
*   **Re-exposure:** **"Zero-Three is Free"** (Free from danger) $\rightarrow$ **0, 3**.
