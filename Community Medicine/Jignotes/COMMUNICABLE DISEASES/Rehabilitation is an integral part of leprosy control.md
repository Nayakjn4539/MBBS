# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Rehabilitation is an integral part of leprosy control

### **Rehabilitation in Leprosy Control**

[[Rehabilitation]] is defined as the combined and coordinated use of medical, social, educational, and vocational measures for training and retraining the individual to the highest possible level of functional ability,.

In the context of [[Leprosy]], rehabilitation is **not** an after-thought; it is an integral part of the control program and must begin as soon as the disease is diagnosed,.

#### **1. The Core Philosophy: Preventive Rehabilitation**
The cheapest, surest, and most effective rehabilitation is to prevent physical deformities and social/vocational disruption in the first place,.
*   **Preventing Dehabilitation:** The approach should begin with preventing **[[Dehabilitation]]** (the process of losing social/economic status due to disease) rather than waiting for the patient to become destitute and then attempting rehabilitation,.
*   **Timing:** Rehabilitation must start at the point of diagnosis, not after the cure.

#### **2. Components of Rehabilitation**
Rehabilitation is comprehensive and includes the following four major areas,:

| Component | Focus Area | Interventions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Medical Rehabilitation** | Restoration of physical function | • Early diagnosis & **[[MDT]]** (Multi-Drug Therapy) <br>• Correction of deformities via **[[Reconstructive Surgery]]** <br>• Use of splints and **[[MCR Footwear]]** (Micro-Cellular Rubber) to protect insensitive feet, |
| **Vocational Rehabilitation** | Restoration of livelihood | • Training patients to work within the limits of their disability but to the hilt of their capacity <br>• Providing tools/loans for self-employment (e.g., sewing machines, livestock) rather than institutional training which often leads to begging |
| **Social Rehabilitation** | Restoration of family/social status | • Preventing social ostracism and stigma <br>• Educational campaigns to ensure family and community acceptance |
| **Psychological Rehabilitation** | Restoration of dignity | • Counseling to restore personal dignity and confidence, <br>• Addressing "Crisis Intervention" immediately after handicap diagnosis |

#### **3. Disability Prevention and Medical Rehabilitation (DPMR)**
Under the **[[National Leprosy Eradication Programme]] (NLEP)**, specific measures are taken to manage disabilities,:

**A. Primary Level Care (PHC/Dispensaries)**
*   Management of simple ulcers.
*   Care of dry, denervated skin (soaking and oiling).
*   Provision of protective aids like **goggles** (for lagophthalmos) and **MCR footwear**.

**B. Secondary Level Care (CHC/District Hospitals)**
*   Management of **[[Lepra Reactions]]** (which precipitate deformities).
*   Management of Grade II disabilities.

**C. Tertiary Level Care (Medical Colleges/Institutes)**
*   **Reconstructive Surgery (RCS):** For correction of claw hands, foot drop, and lagophthalmos.
*   **Incentives:** The government provides an incentive (welfare allowance) of **Rs. 8,000/-** to BPL patients undergoing reconstructive surgery to compensate for wage loss,.

---

#### **4. Community-Based Rehabilitation (CBR)**
*   **Concept:** Instead of isolating patients in "Leprosy Homes" or asylums, rehabilitation should occur within the general community setting.
*   **Goal:** Social inclusion and equalization of opportunities.
*   **Execution:** Implemented through the combined efforts of disabled people, their families, and relevant governmental/non-governmental health, education, and vocational services.

### **Clinical Relevance: Preventing "Dehabilitation"**
*   **The Vicious Cycle:** Disease $\rightarrow$ Stigma/Deformity $\rightarrow$ Loss of Job $\rightarrow$ Poverty $\rightarrow$ Begging (Dehabilitation).
*   **Intervention:** If a laborer develops anesthesia in the hands, **Vocational Rehabilitation** involves teaching them to use protective gloves or switching to tools with insulated handles *before* they injure themselves and lose their job. This halts the transition from **Impairment $\rightarrow$ Handicap**,.

### **Mnemonic: "M-V-S-P"**
To remember the components of Rehabilitation:
*   **M** - **M**edical (Fix the body)
*   **V** - **V**ocational (Fix the job)
*   **S** - **S**ocial (Fix the family/society bond)
*   **P** - **P**sychological (Fix the mind)
