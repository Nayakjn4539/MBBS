# [[Forensic Psychiatry]] > McNaughten's Rule and Durham's Rule

### McNaughten’s Rule (The Right or Wrong Test)

This is the classic legal test for [[criminal responsibility]] of the insane, established in England in 1843. It forms the basis of the law regarding the defense of insanity in many countries, including India ([[Section 84 IPC]]).

#### 1. Historical Background (The Case)
*   **The Accused:** Daniel McNaughten, a wood-turner from Glasgow.
*   **The Disease:** He suffered from **paranoid schizophrenia** with [[delusion]]s of persecution (he believed the Tory Party was persecuting him).
*   **The Crime:** On January 20, 1843, he attempted to assassinate Sir Robert Peel (the Prime Minister of England) but mistakenly shot and killed his private secretary, **Edward Drummond**.
*   **The Verdict:** He was acquitted on the grounds of insanity ("Not Guilty").
*   **The Aftermath:** The acquittal caused a public uproar. The House of Lords summoned 15 judges to clarify the law regarding criminal responsibility of the insane. Their answers became the **McNaughten Rules**.

#### 2. The Rule (Legal Principles)
The rule states that every man is presumed to be sane until the contrary is proved. To establish a defense on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was laboring under such a **defect of reason**, from **disease of the mind**, as:
1.  **Not to know the nature and quality of the act** he was doing; **OR**
2.  If he did know it, that **he did not know he was doing what was wrong**.

**Key Components Breakdown:**
| Component | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Defect of Reason** | There must be an inability to use reason effectively. Mere emotional instability is not enough. |
| **Disease of Mind** | The defect must stem from a mental illness (e.g., [[Schizophrenia]]), not just temporary confusion or intoxication. |
| **Nature and Quality** | Refers to the physical nature of the act (e.g., thinking he is squeezing a lemon when he is actually squeezing a throat). |
| **Knowledge of Wrong** | The inability to distinguish right from wrong regarding that specific act. |

#### 3. Medicolegal Aspects (Application in India)
*   **Section 84 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC):** This section is based entirely on McNaughten's rules. It states: *"Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law."*
*   **Legal vs. Medical Insanity:**
    *   **Medical Insanity:** Any mental illness (psychosis, neurosis, etc.).
    *   **Legal Insanity:** A mental illness that impairs the **cognitive faculties** (the ability to understand the nature and consequences of the act) at the time of the crime.
    *   *Note:* All medically insane persons are not legally insane. A person may be medically mentally ill but still criminally responsible if they knew what they were doing was wrong.

#### 4. Critique/Limitations
*   It focuses solely on **cognition** (intellect/reasoning).
*   It ignores **volition** (willpower) and **emotion**.
*   It does not cover [[Irresistible Impulse]] (where a person knows the act is wrong but cannot stop themselves).

### Durham’s Rule (The Product Test)

This rule was established later to address the rigid limitations of McNaughten's rule.

*   **Origin:** Established in 1954 (Durham v. United States).
*   **The Rule:** An accused person is **not criminally responsible** if his unlawful act was the **product** of mental disease or mental defect.
*   **Significance:** It is much broader than McNaughten's rule. It implies that if the crime would not have been committed *but for* the mental illness, the accused is not guilty.
*   **Status:** It was widely criticized for being too broad and giving too much power to psychiatric experts rather than the jury. It is largely replaced or modified in modern legal systems but remains historically significant in [[Forensic Psychiatry]].

### Mnemonic: **MAD** McNaughten

To remember the components of McNaughten's Rule:
*   **M** - **M**ind disease caused...
*   **A** - **A**ct's nature not known...
*   **D** - **D**idn't know it was wrong.
