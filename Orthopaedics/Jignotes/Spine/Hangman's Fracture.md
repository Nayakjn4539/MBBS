# Hangman's Fracture (Traumatic Spondylolisthesis of the Axis)

### Definition
**Hangman's Fracture** is a fracture involving the **bilateral** [[pars interarticularis]] (or pedicles) of the [[axis]] (C2 vertebra). It results in the separation of the posterior neural arch from the vertebral body of C2, often leading to the anterior displacement ([[spondylolisthesis]]) of the C2 vertebral body over C3.

### Mechanism of Injury
The injury mechanism differs between the historical judicial context and modern trauma.

1.  **Judicial Hanging (Historical):**
    *   The knot is placed submentally (below the chin).
    *   Following the drop, the neck undergoes forcible **hyperextension** combined with **distraction** due to the body weight.
    *   This causes the fracture and tearing of the C2/3 [[intervertebral disc]], often resulting in immediate death due to cord transection.

2.  **Civilian Injuries (Modern - Most Common):**
    *   **Road Traffic Accidents (RTA):** Typically occurs when the forehead or chin strikes the dashboard or windshield.
    *   **Falls:** Falling from a height.
    *   **Mechanism:** It is a complex force involving **hyperextension** combined with **compression** (axial loading) followed by flexion.

### Pathoanatomy
*   **Fracture Site:** Bilateral fracture through the [[pars interarticularis]] (the isthmus connecting the superior and inferior articular facets) of the C2 vertebra.
*   **Displacement:** The C2 vertebral body may slide anteriorly over C3 (Traumatic [[spondylolisthesis]]).
*   **Ligamentous Injury:** In severe cases (like judicial hanging), the [[posterior longitudinal ligament]] and the C2-C3 disc are disrupted.

### Clinical Features
*   **History:** High-velocity trauma (RTA) or fall.
*   **Symptoms:** Neck pain, stiffness, and restricted neck movement.
*   **Neurological Status:**
    *   **Paradoxically**, neurological deficit is **unusual** or rare in survivors.
    *   **Reason:** The fracture of the posterior arch creates a separation between the vertebral body and the posterior elements. This effectively **decompresses** the [[spinal canal]] ("auto-decompression"), sparing the [[spinal cord]] from compression.

***
**Clinical Implication:**
Despite the severe radiographic appearance, the widening of the spinal canal usually protects the cord. However, the spine is **potentially unstable**, and mishandling can lead to catastrophic cord injury.

### Imaging Findings
*   **X-Ray (Lateral View):**
    *   Shows the fracture line through the pars interarticularis or pedicles of C2.
    *   Anterior displacement of C2 body over C3 may be visible.
    *   Prevertebral soft tissue swelling may be present.
*   **CT Scan:**
    *   Method of choice to define the fracture geometry and extent of bony injury.
*   **MRI:**
    *   Used to assess the status of the [[intervertebral disc]] at C2-C3 and the integrity of the [[posterior ligament complex]].

### Classification (Effendi / Levine & Edwards)
Although specific classification systems vary, management is generally based on stability and displacement:

| Type | Description | Stability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type I** | Minimally displaced fracture (<3mm); C2-C3 disc intact. | Stable |
| **Type II** | Displaced fracture (>3mm) with angulation; C2-C3 disc disrupted. | Unstable |
| **Type III** | Fracture with bilateral C2-C3 **facet dislocation**. | Highly Unstable |

### Management

#### 1. Emergency Care
*   Immobilization of the cervical spine (cervical collar, sandbags, spine board) at the accident site.
*   **Do not** apply traction if Type IIA (distraction injury) is suspected as it may worsen the displacement.

#### 2. Conservative Treatment
*   **Indications:** Minimally displaced fractures, stable injuries (Type I).
*   **Methods:**
    *   **Skeletal Traction:** Used initially to achieve reduction in displaced fractures.
    *   **Immobilization:** Once reduced, the neck is immobilized in a **Halo-Vest** (Halo-body orthosis) or a rigid [[cervical collar]] (e.g., Philadelphia collar) for **6 to 12 weeks**.
    *   Healing usually occurs by bony union or stable fibrous union.

#### 3. Surgical Treatment
*   **Indications:**
    *   Unstable fractures (Type II/III).
    *   Failure of conservative treatment (non-union).
    *   Displaced fractures that cannot be reduced by traction.
*   **Procedures:**
    *   **Anterior C2-C3 Fusion:** Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF).
    *   **Posterior Stabilization:** C1-C3 fusion or direct C2 pars screw fixation (osteosynthesis).

### Complications
*   **Non-union:** Failure of the fracture to heal.
*   **Malunion:** Healing in a deformed position.
*   **Late Instability:** Chronic pain or delayed neurological issues.
*   **Vertebral Artery Injury:** The fracture line is close to the foramen transversarium; injury to the [[vertebral artery]] may occur.
