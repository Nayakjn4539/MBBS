# Temporal Bone Fractures

**Introduction**
[[Temporal bone]] fractures are complex injuries often resulting from high-velocity blunt head trauma. The temporal bone houses vital structures including the cochleovestibular apparatus, [[facial nerve]], [[jugular bulb]], and [[internal carotid artery]].

**Etiology:**
*   Road traffic accidents (most common).
*   Falls and assaults.
*   Gunshot wounds (penetrating trauma).
*   **Demographics:** Males aged 21–30 years are the most commonly involved group.

### Classification Systems

#### 1. Traditional Classification (Based on Fracture Line)
Classified based on the relationship of the fracture line to the long axis of the [[petrous pyramid]]. Most fractures are actually mixed, but this classification is classic for exams.

| Feature | **Longitudinal Fracture** | **Transverse Fracture** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Incidence** | More Common (70–90%) | Less Common (10–30%) |
| **Mechanism** | Lateral blow (Temporoparietal region) | Frontal or Occipital blow |
| **Fracture Line** | Parallel to long axis of petrous pyramid | Perpendicular to long axis of petrous pyramid |
| **Path** | Squamous part $\rightarrow$ Roof of EAC $\rightarrow$ Middle ear $\rightarrow$ Petrous apex (sparing otic capsule) | Foramen magnum $\rightarrow$ Across petrous pyramid $\rightarrow$ Middle cranial fossa |
| **Tympanic Membrane** | Usually torn (Step deformity in EAC) | Usually intact (Hemotympanum seen) |
| **Bleeding from Ear** | Common | Rare (blood trapped behind intact TM) |
| **Hearing Loss** | **[[Conductive hearing loss]]** (Ossicular disruption) | **[[Sensorineural hearing loss]]** (Labyrinthine damage) |
| **Vertigo** | Less common (Concussion) | Severe (Labyrinthine destruction) |
| **Facial Nerve Palsy** | Less common (~20%); Delayed onset | More common (~50%); Immediate onset |
| **CSF Leak** | Otorrhea (common) | Rhinorrhea (via Eustachian tube) |

**Mnemonic for Longitudinal Fracture:**
**L** - Lateral blow
**L** - Longitudinal
**L** - Less facial nerve injury
**L** - Low frequency loss (Conductive)

#### 2. Clinical Classification (Modern)
This classification is more clinically relevant as it predicts complications.
1.  **Otic Capsule Sparing:** Similar to longitudinal fractures; better prognosis for hearing and facial nerve function.
2.  **Otic Capsule Violating:** Similar to transverse fractures; higher risk of [[sensorineural hearing loss]], [[facial nerve paralysis]], and CSF leak.

### Clinical Features

**1. Ear Signs**
*   **Haemotympanum:** Dark bluish-black tympanic membrane due to blood in the middle ear. Common in transverse fractures with intact TM.
*   **Bleeding per ear:** Due to skin laceration or TM perforation.
*   **Step deformity:** Palpable or visible fracture line in the external auditory canal.

**2. Ecchymosis**
*   **[[Battle's sign]]:** Post-auricular ecchymosis over the mastoid process. Indicates extravasation of blood along the path of the posterior auricular artery.
*   **Raccoon Eyes:** Periorbital ecchymosis (indicates anterior cranial fossa fracture).

**3. Hearing Loss**
*   **Conductive Hearing Loss (CHL):** Usually due to hemotympanum (temporary) or ossicular discontinuity (persistent).
    *   *Most common ossicular injury:* **Incus dislocation** (incudostapedial joint separation).
*   **Sensorineural Hearing Loss (SNHL):** Due to fracture through the [[cochlea]] or labyrinthine concussion.

**4. Vestibular Symptoms**
*   Vertigo and spontaneous nystagmus.
*   More severe in transverse fractures due to direct labyrinthine damage.

**5. Facial Nerve Palsy**
*   **Longitudinal #:** Injury usually at the **tympanic segment** (distal to geniculate ganglion). Often delayed onset due to edema.
*   **Transverse #:** Injury usually at the **labyrinthine segment** (proximal to geniculate ganglion). Often immediate onset due to transection.

**6. CSF Leak**
*   **[[CSF Otorrhea]]:** Leakage of CSF through the ear canal (requires torn dura and perforated TM).
*   **[[CSF Rhinorrhea]]:** Leakage of CSF into the nasopharynx via the [[Eustachian tube]] (if TM is intact).

### Investigations

**1. Imaging (Gold Standard)**
*   **[[High-Resolution CT]] (HRCT) of Temporal Bone:**
    *   Axial and coronal cuts.
    *   Identifies fracture lines, ossicular dislocation, and optic capsule involvement.
    *   Helps plan surgical approach for facial nerve decompression.

**2. Facial Nerve Testing**
*   **Topodiagnostic tests:** Schirmer's test (lacrimation) to localize the site of lesion.
*   **Electrodiagnostics:** [[Electroneuronography]] (ENoG) is useful for prognosis in complete paralysis. >90% degeneration suggests need for surgical exploration.

**3. Hearing Assessment**
*   **Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA):** Differentiates CHL vs SNHL. Performed when the patient is stable and conscious.
*   **Tuning Fork Tests:** Bedside assessment.

**4. CSF Leak Confirmation**
*   **Beta-2 Transferrin assay:** Highly specific for CSF.
*   **Halo Sign:** Double ring sign on filter paper (blood in center, clear CSF halo around it).
*   **Reservoir Sign:** Gush of fluid upon bending forward.

### Management

**A. General Measures**
*   Stabilize patient (ABC protocol). Rule out cervical spine and intracranial injuries.
*   **Systemic Antibiotics:** To prevent meningitis (controversial, but often used).
*   **Strict Aural Toilet:** Do **NOT** syringe the ear. Use suction clearance only under microscope.

**B. Management of Facial Nerve Palsy**
*   **Delayed Onset / Incomplete Palsy:**
    *   Conservative management.
    *   Systemic [[Corticosteroids]] (e.g., Prednisolone) to reduce edema.
    *   Eye care (lubrication, taping).
    *   Prognosis: Excellent (85-90% recovery).
*   **Immediate Onset / Complete Palsy:**
    *   Indicates severe injury (transection or bony spicule compression).
    *   **Surgical Exploration:** Decompression or nerve repair/grafting.
    *   Timing: Usually done once patient is stable (within 2-3 weeks).

**C. Management of CSF Leak**
*   **Conservative (First line):**
    *   Head elevation (30 degrees).
    *   Stool softeners (avoid straining).
    *   Avoid nose blowing.
    *   Most leaks close spontaneously within 1-2 weeks.
*   **Surgical:**
    *   Indicated if leak persists > 2 weeks or recurrent meningitis.
    *   Repair via transmastoid or middle cranial fossa approach.

**D. Management of Hearing Loss**
*   **Hemotympanum:** Resolves spontaneously in 3-4 weeks.
*   **Persistent CHL (> 3 months):** Suspect ossicular disruption. Treatment: [[Ossiculoplasty]].
*   **SNHL:** Permanent. Hearing rehabilitation (Hearing aids). Cochlear implant may be needed (caution: risk of labyrinthitis ossificans).

### Clinical Implications
*   **Prognosis of Facial Nerve:** In longitudinal fractures, facial palsy is usually delayed and temporary. In transverse fractures, it is often immediate and permanent without surgery.
*   **[[Battle's Sign]]:** Usually appears 24-48 hours after injury. Do not rely on it for acute diagnosis.
*   **Gunshot Wounds:** Often cause extensive comminuted fractures and have a high rate of immediate facial paralysis and CSF leaks.
