# [[Asphyxia]] > Hanging vs Strangulation

### Hanging vs. Strangulation (Ligature Strangulation)

This is one of the most critical differentiations in [[Forensic Medicine]], often determining whether a death is ruled as suicide or homicide. The fundamental difference lies in the **constricting force**: in [[Hanging]], the force is the weight of the body (gravity), whereas in [[Ligature Strangulation]], the force is applied externally (usually by hands pulling the ligature).

### Comparative Features: Hanging vs. Ligature Strangulation

The following table summarizes the classic differences found during [[Medicolegal Autopsy]]:

| Feature | [[Hanging]] | [[Ligature Strangulation]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Constricting Force** | Weight of the body (Gravity). | External mechanical force applied to the ligature. |
| **Face** | Usually **pale** (due to complete arterial compression). | Congested, livid, and marked with **petechiae**. |
| **Neck appearance** | Stretched and elongated. | Not elongated. |
| **Ligature Mark: Level** | **High up**, usually above the [[Thyroid Cartilage]] (between larynx and chin). | **Low down**, usually at or below the thyroid cartilage. |
| **Ligature Mark: Direction** | **Oblique**; runs upwards towards the knot (except in partial hanging). | **Transverse**; runs horizontally around the neck. |
| **Ligature Mark: Continuity** | **Incomplete** (Non-continuous); interrupted at the knot site. | **Complete** (Continuous); encircles the entire neck. |
| **Ligature Mark: Base** | Pale, hard, dry, and **parchment-like** (yellowish-brown). | Often soft, reddish, and vegetable-like. |
| **Subcutaneous Tissue** | White, hard, glistening under the mark. | Ecchymosed (bruised) under the mark. |
| **Neck Muscles** | Injury is rare; if present, usually slight. | **Severe injury** and laceration of muscles are common. |
| **Hyoid Bone Fracture** | Fracture involves **outward** displacement (Abduction) due to A-P compression. | Fracture involves **inward** displacement (Adduction) due to lateral compression. |
| **Carotid Arteries** | **[[Amussat's Sign]]** may be present (transverse tear of intima). | Internal damage to carotid arteries is rare. |
| **Thyroid Cartilage** | Fracture is rare. | Fracture is more common. |
| **Saliva** | **Dribbling of saliva** from the angle of the mouth is frequent (Vital sign). | Absent. |
| **Bleeding (Nose/Ears)** | Less common. | More common (due to intense venous congestion). |
| **Involuntary Discharge** | Urine/Feces discharge is less common. Semen at glans common. | Urine/Feces discharge is more common. |
| **Signs of Asphyxia** | Less marked (especially in typical/complete hanging). | **Well marked** (Tardieu spots, cyanosis). |
| **Manner of Death** | Mostly **Suicidal**. | Mostly **Homicidal**. |

### Detailed Analysis of Key Differences

#### 1. Ligature Mark Characteristics
*   **Hanging:** The mark depends on the suspension point. In a **typical hanging** (knot at occiput), the mark is highest at the center of the loop and slants upward toward the knot. The skin at the knot site is usually spared (inverted 'V' shape).
    *   *Note:* In partial hanging or using a sliding noose (slip knot), the mark may become circular and lower, simulating strangulation.
*   **Strangulation:** The ligature is pulled tight, often from behind. The mark is usually circular and located lower on the neck (over the larynx/trachea). It is continuous because the force is applied circumferentially.

#### 2. Hyoid Bone and Laryngeal Fractures
*   **Mechanism in Hanging:** The weight of the body pulls the hyoid bone *upwards* against the mandible. The divergence of the greater horns increases due to anteroposterior compression, leading to fracture with **outward displacement** of fragments.
*   **Mechanism in Strangulation:** Direct lateral compression pushes the greater horns *inwards*, leading to fracture with **inward displacement** of fragments.
*   **Thyroid Cartilage:** More likely to be fractured in strangulation due to the lower level of constriction.

#### 3. Dribbling of Saliva
This is considered the **surest sign of antemortem hanging**.
*   **Mechanism:** The ligature compresses and stimulates the submandibular salivary glands. As the head droops to the side opposite the knot, saliva flows out due to gravity.
*   It is absent in postmortem hanging (suspension of a dead body).

#### 4. Amussat’s Sign
*   Found in **Hanging**.
*   It is a transverse tear in the intimal lining of the [[Carotid Artery]] (usually just below the bifurcation).
*   Caused by excessive stretching of the vessel wall combined with direct pressure. It is rare in strangulation because the neck is not stretched.

### Mnemonics

**"HANG"** vs **"STRANGLE"**

*   **H** - **H**igh up mark (Above thyroid)
*   **A** - **A**mussat’s sign (Carotid tear)
*   **N** - **N**on-continuous mark (Gap at knot)
*   **G** - **G**ravity dependent (Saliva dribbling)

*   **S** - **S**traight line (Transverse mark)
*   **T** - **T**rauma to muscles (severe)
*   **R** - **R**ed/Congested face
*   **A** - **A**sphyxia signs prominent
*   **N** - **N**o dribbling of saliva
*   **G** - **G**roove is low (Below thyroid)
*   **L** - **L**ow level constriction
*   **E** - **E**xternal force

### Medicolegal Aspects

1.  **Suicide:** Hanging is the most common method of suicide. Suicidal strangulation is very rare (requires a mechanism like a Spanish windlass to maintain pressure after loss of consciousness).
2.  **Homicide:** Strangulation is a common method of homicide (especially when combined with sexual assault). Homicidal hanging is rare (lynching) and usually requires a victim who is incapacitated (intoxicated/unconscious) or a disproportionate size difference between assailant and victim.
3.  **Postmortem Hanging:** A body may be suspended *after* death (often after homicidal strangulation) to simulate suicide.
    *   *Clue:* Look for signs of struggle, lack of vital reaction in the ligature mark (no redness/ecchymosis at edges), and absence of saliva dribbling.
4.  **Accident:** Accidental hanging occurs (e.g., autoerotic asphyxia, infants in cribs). Accidental strangulation can occur if clothing gets caught in machinery.
