# [[Neuro-Ophthalmology]] > Papilledema

# [[Papilledema]]

### Definition
**Papilledema** is defined as the passive, non-inflammatory swelling (oedema) of the [[optic disc]] (optic nerve head) secondary to raised [[intracranial pressure]] (ICP).
*   **Note:** The term "disc oedema" is generic for any swelling of the disc (e.g., inflammation, ischemia, hypotony), whereas "papilledema" is specifically reserved for swelling caused by elevated ICP.

### Etiopathogenesis
The primary mechanism is the **blockage of axoplasmic transport**.
1.  **Pressure Gradient Alteration:** The [[optic nerve]] is surrounded by meningeal sheaths continuous with the brain. Increased ICP is transmitted to the subarachnoid space around the optic nerve.
2.  **Hayreh’s Theory:** The high pressure in the retrolaminar region alters the pressure gradient across the [[lamina cribrosa]].
3.  **Axoplasmic Stasis:** This causes stasis of slow axoplasmic flow in the prelaminar region $\rightarrow$ Swelling of axons $\rightarrow$ Secondary venous congestion and extracellular edema.

### Etiology
Papilledema is almost always **bilateral**, though it may be asymmetric.
*   **Intracranial Space-Occupying Lesions (ICSOLs):** Brain tumors (Posterior fossa tumors cause it more rapidly than supratentorial), abscesses, tuberculoma, subdural hematoma.
*   **Intracranial Infections:** [[Meningitis]], [[encephalitis]].
*   **Vascular:** Subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, [[malignant hypertension]].
*   **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH):** Also known as [[Pseudotumor cerebri]]; common in obese females.
*   **Congenital:** [[Craniosynostosis]], aqueductal stenosis.

### Clinical Features
#### Symptoms
*   **Visual Acuity:** Usually **normal** in early and established stages (unlike optic neuritis).
*   **Amaurosis Fugax:** Transient visual obscurations (blackouts) lasting a few seconds, often precipitated by standing up (postural).
*   **Systemic Symptoms of Raised ICP:**
    *   **Headache:** Worse in the morning or recumbent position.
    *   **Vomiting:** Often projectile.
    *   **Diplopia:** Due to [[CN VI palsy]] (lateral rectus paralysis), which acts as a false localizing sign due to pressure.

#### Ophthalmoscopic Signs (Stages of Papilledema)
> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Fundus changes in different stages of papilledema

**1. Early (Incipient) Stage:**
*   **Blurring of disc margins:** Starts at the nasal margin, followed by superior, inferior, and finally temporal.
*   **Hyperemia:** Disc appears red and "juicy".
*   **Loss of Spontaneous Venous Pulsation (SVP):** An early sign (Note: SVP is absent in 20% of the normal population, so its presence rules out papilledema, but absence is not diagnostic).

**2. Established (Acute) Stage:**
*   **Elevation:** Mushrooming or dome-shaped elevation of the disc.
*   **Vascular Changes:** Veins become tortuous and engorged. Splinter hemorrhages and [[cotton wool spots]] appear near the disc.
*   **Paton's Lines:** Circumferential retinochoroidal folds due to edema separating nerve fibers.
*   **Macular Star:** Hard exudates radiating from the fovea.
*   **Blind Spot:** Enlarged on visual field testing due to fluid separation of the retina.

**3. Chronic (Vintage) Stage:**
*   **Champagne Cork Appearance:** The disc remains elevated but hemorrhages and cotton wool spots resolve.
*   **Corpora Amylacea:** Small crystalline, drusen-like deposits on the disc surface.
*   Visual fields begin to constrict.

**4. Atrophic Stage (Secondary Optic Atrophy):**
*   **Appearance:** Dirty grey-white color of the disc.
*   **Margins:** Ill-defined/blurred (unlike primary optic atrophy where margins are sharp).
*   **Vessels:** Attenuated (narrowed) with perivascular sheathing.
*   **Vision:** Severely impaired with concentric constriction of visual fields.

### Comparison: Papilledema vs. Papillitis (Optic Neuritis)

[[Papillitis]] is the inflammation of the [[optic nerve head]], whereas Papilledema is passive swelling due to ICP.

| Feature | Papilledema (Raised ICP) | Papillitis (Optic Neuritis) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Laterality** | Usually **Bilateral** | Usually **Unilateral** |
| **Visual Acuity** | **Normal** (until late stages) | **Marked loss** of vision (Sudden) |
| **Pupillary Reaction** | **Normal** (unless atrophic) | **Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect ([[RAPD]])** / Marcus Gunn Pupil is present |
| **Pain** | Headache (generalized) | **Pain on ocular movement** |
| **Disc Swelling** | Marked (2–6 Diopters) | Mild (Usually < 3 Diopters) |
| **Visual Fields** | Enlarged [[blind spot]] | **Central scotoma** |
| **Color Vision** | Normal | Impaired (Red-Green defect) |
| **Media** | Clear | Posterior vitreous haze/cells often present |
| **Fluorescein Angio.** | Vertical oval pool of dye (leakage) | Minimal leakage |

### Clinical Implications
*   **Foster Kennedy Syndrome:** A tumor in the frontal lobe (e.g., olfactory groove meningioma) causes **ipsilateral optic atrophy** (direct pressure) and **contralateral papilledema** (raised ICP).
*   **Pseudo-papilledema:** Condition where disc appears swollen but is not edematous. Causes include [[hypermetropia]] and [[optic disc drusen]].
*   **Urgency:** Papilledema is a neurological emergency requiring urgent neuroimaging (MRI/CT) to rule out mass lesions.
