# [[Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases]] > Accidents and Injuries

# Accidents and Injuries: Road Traffic Accidents (RTA)

### Definition
An accident is defined as an "unexpected, unplanned occurrence which may involve injury" or "an unpremeditated event resulting in recognizable damage",.
*   RTA is part of the modern epidemic of [[Non-Communicable Diseases]].
*   They are **preventable** public health problems, not merely accidental "acts of God".

### Problem Statement
*   **Global Burden:**
    *   RTAs are a leading cause of death globally (approx. 1.35 million deaths/year).
    *   It is the **8th leading cause of death** for all ages and the **#1 cause of death** for children and young adults (5–29 years).
    *   **Vulnerable Road Users:** Pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists account for >50% of global road traffic deaths.
*   **Indian Scenario:**
    *   RTAs are the leading cause of accidental deaths in India.
    *   Significant economic loss (treatment costs, lost productivity).
    *   Semi-urban and rural areas contribute 60–80% of road accident injuries in the South-East Asia region.

### Epidemiology: The Accident Triad
Accidents are multifactorial, resulting from the interaction of the **Host**, **Agent**, and **Environment**,.

#### 1. Human Factors (Host) - Responsibility: ~90%
*   **Age:** Young adults (15–24 years) are most vulnerable.
*   **Sex:** Males are significantly more involved than females (3:1 ratio).
*   **Medical Conditions:** Poor vision, sudden illness (heart attack, epilepsy), fatigue.
*   **Psychosocial:** Impulsiveness, risk-taking behavior, lack of experience, aggression, stress.
*   **Behavioral:** Non-use of [[safety gear]] (helmets, seatbelts), violation of traffic rules.

#### 2. Environmental Factors
*   **Road Conditions:** Narrow roads, defective layout, poor lighting, lack of signs.
*   **Weather:** Rain, fog, poor visibility.
*   **Traffic Mix:** A mixture of slow (pedestrians, animals, cycles) and fast-moving vehicles on the same road.

#### 3. Agent Factors (Vehicle)
*   **Condition:** Old, poorly maintained vehicles, brake failure, burst tires.
*   **Design:** Lack of safety features (airbags, crumple zones).
*   **Type:** Motorized two-wheelers carry a 5x higher risk of death compared to cars.

### Major Risk Factors
1.  **Speed:** Increase in average speed is directly related to the likelihood and severity of a crash. Pedestrians have a <50% chance of survival if hit at 45 km/h.
2.  **Alcohol ([[Drink-driving]]):** Risk increases significantly above BAC of 0.04 g/dl. Alcohol impairs judgment and reaction time.
3.  **Helmets:** Correct usage reduces death risk by ~42% and severe head injury by ~69%.
4.  **Seat-belts:** Reduces fatality risk by 40–50% for front-seat passengers.
5.  **Distracted Driving:** Use of mobile phones (texting or calling) increases crash risk by 4 times.

### The Haddon Matrix
This is a framework used to analyze injury events and develop prevention strategies by combining the Epidemiological Triad with the Timeline of the event,.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a 3x3 table with Phases (Pre-event, Event, Post-event) on the Y-axis and Factors (Host, Agent/Vehicle, Environment) on the X-axis

| Phase | Host (Human) | Agent (Vehicle) | Environment (Physical/Social) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pre-Event** (Prevent crash) | Driver training, Alcohol control, Avoid fatigue | Brakes, tires, lights maintenance | Road design, speed limits, signs, pedestrian barriers |
| **Event** (Prevent injury) | Use of [[Seat belts]], [[Helmets]] | Airbags, crash-worthy design, no sharp edges | Crash barriers, soft shoulders on roads |
| **Post-Event** (Prevent death) | First-aid skills, access to care | Ease of extrication, non-flammable fuel tanks | Emergency medical services, trauma care centers |

### Prevention and Control

#### 1. Data Collection (Accidentology)
*   Establish a reporting system to identify black spots and causes.
*   Research correlates accident experience with personal attributes and environmental conditions.

#### 2. Primordial & Primary Prevention (Pre-Crash)
*   **Safety Education:** Target school children, drivers, and the public regarding traffic rules and defensive driving.
*   **Enforcement of Laws:** Strict implementation of the Motor Vehicles Act (speed limits, drunk driving checks, licensing).
*   **Safety Measures Promotion:**
    *   Mandatory **Helmets** and **Seat belts**.
    *   **Windshields:** Use of **Laminated glass** (plastic layer between glass sheets) instead of toughened glass to prevent head injuries.
    *   **Child Restraints:** Children should be seated in the rear.
*   **Environmental Modification:** Better road lighting, separate lanes for slow traffic, removal of black spots.

#### 3. Secondary Prevention (Post-Crash)
*   **Trauma Care:** Concept of the **[[Golden Hour]]** (first hour after injury is critical for survival).
*   **First Aid:** Training police, drivers, and volunteers in basic life support.
*   **Ambulance Services:** Equipped for stabilization during transport.
*   **Hospital Care:** Dedicated [[Trauma Care Facilities]] with Triage protocols.

#### 4. Tertiary Prevention
*   **Rehabilitation:** Medical, vocational, and social rehabilitation to reduce disability and handicap.

### Mnemonic
**4 E's** of Injury Prevention:
1.  **E**ngineering (Roads/Vehicles)
2.  **E**nforcement (Laws/Police)
3.  **E**ducation (Behavior change)
4.  **E**mergency Care (Medical response)
