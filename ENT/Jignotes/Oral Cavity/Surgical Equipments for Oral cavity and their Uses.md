### Surgical Equipments for Oral Cavity and their Uses

#### 1. Examination and Retraction Instruments

**1. Lack’s Tongue Depressor**
*   **Description:** L-shaped instrument with a flat end and a curved end.
*   **Uses:**
    *   Examination of [[Oral Cavity]] and [[Oropharynx]] (depresses tongue, retracts cheek).
    *   **Posterior Rhinoscopy:** Used as an adjunct to depress the tongue.
    *   **Cold Spatula Test:** To check nasal patency (mist formation).
    *   Assessment of **Gag Reflex**.
*   **Clinical Implication:** When examining, the flat end is placed at the junction of the anterior two-thirds and posterior one-third of the tongue. Placing it too posterior initiates the gag reflex; too anterior causes the tongue to bulge, obstructing vision.

**2. Boyle-Davis Mouth Gag**
*   **Components:** Consists of the Davis gag (frame) and detachable Boyle’s tongue blades (various sizes for children/adults).
*   **Mechanism:** Opens the mouth and retracts the tongue anteriorly and inferiorly. It is self-retaining via a ratchet.
*   **Uses:**
    *   [[Tonsillectomy]] and [[Adenoidectomy]].
    *   Palatal surgeries (e.g., [[Cleft Palate]] repair, [[Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty]]).
    *   Excision of [[Angiofibroma]].
*   **Associated Instrument:** **Draffin’s Bipod Stand**. Used to support the mouth gag and suspend it, keeping the surgeon's hands free. The bipod rings rest on a Magauran plate.
*   **Clinical Implication:**
    *   Must be used with the patient in **Rose’s Position** (neck extended).
    *   **Caution:** Can cause injury to lips, teeth (incisors), or temporomandibular joint if opened excessively or if lips are caught.
    *   **Russell-Davis blades** have a central groove to accommodate the [[Endotracheal Tube]].

**3. Doyen’s Mouth Gag**
*   **Description:** Self-retaining gag applied on the side of the mouth (molar teeth).
*   **Uses:**
    *   Intraoral surgeries where tongue retraction is **not** required or when operating on the tongue itself (e.g., [[Glossectomy]], hemiglossectomy).
    *   Surgeries on the floor of the mouth (e.g., [[Ranula]], calculi).
    *   Dental surgeries.
*   **Contraindication:** Edentulous patients (requires teeth for grip).

**4. Jenning’s Mouth Gag**
*   **Use:** Applied in the center of the mouth to keep it open; useful when tongue depression is not the primary goal.

**5. Cheek Retractors (Hajek’s / Roux)**
*   **Description:** Curved blade or S-shaped instrument.
*   **Uses:** Retracts cheek/lips for exposure of gingivolabial sulcus during **Caldwell-Luc operation**, maxillectomy, or fracture repair.

#### 2. Tonsillectomy Instruments (Dissection and Snare Method)

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Tray setup for Tonsillectomy instruments

**1. Denis Browne Tonsil Holding Forceps**
*   **Description:** A box-joint, angular instrument. The upper jaw fits *inside* the lower jaw (unlike Luc's forceps where jaws meet).
*   **Use:** To grasp the [[Tonsil]] and pull it medially to define the plane of cleavage between the capsule and the superior constrictor muscle.
*   **Feature:** Designed to hold tissue firmly without cutting.

**2. Waugh’s Tonsil Dissection Forceps**
*   **Description:** Long dissecting forceps, can be toothed or non-toothed.
*   **Use:**
    *   Making the initial incision in the mucosa.
    *   Dissection of the tonsil.
    *   Catching bleeding points.

**3. Tonsil Knife**
*   **Description:** Sickle-shaped curved blade.
*   **Use:** Making the initial mucosal incision at the anterior pillar/upper pole.

**4. Mollison’s Tonsil Dissector and Anterior Pillar Retractor**
*   **Description:** Double-ended instrument.
    *   **Dissector End:** Blunt end used to separate the tonsil capsule from the peritonsillar bed (superior constrictor).
    *   **Retractor End:** Curved/broad end used to retract the **Anterior Pillar** to visualize bleeding points in the fossa after removal.

**5. Eve’s Tonsil Snare**
*   **Description:** Heavy instrument with a wire loop (25 SWG wire) and a ratchet mechanism.
*   **Use:** To sever the tonsil pedicle at the lower pole.
*   **Mechanism:** It **crushes** the vascular pedicle rather than cutting it cleanly. This crushing action releases tissue thromboplastin, promoting natural [[Hemostasis]].

**6. Tonsil Artery Forceps (Hemostats)**

| Feature | Burkitt’s / Straight Forceps | Negus / Curved Forceps |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shape** | Straight, slender | Tip is sharply curved |
| **Primary Use** | To **catch** the bleeding point | Used as a **replacement** forceps to ligate (tie) the vessel |
| **Benefit** | Better visibility in deep fossa | Curve facilitates passing a ligature tie |

**7. Negus Knot Tier**
*   **Use:** Helps slide and tighten the ligature knot deep into the tonsillar fossa onto the tip of the artery forceps.

**8. Yankauer’s Suction Tube**
*   **Description:** Rigid suction tube with a bulbous/guarded tip.
*   **Use:** Suctioning blood and secretions during oral/pharyngeal surgeries.
*   **Clinical Implication:** The guarded tip prevents trauma to the pharyngeal mucosa and avoids suctioning the soft palate or uvula.

#### 3. Adenoidectomy Instruments

**1. St. Clair Thomson Adenoid Curette**
*   **Description:** A square/curved window with a sharp blade. Two types:
    *   **With Cage (Guard):** The cage holds the resected adenoid tissue, preventing aspiration into the larynx.
    *   **Without Cage:** Used to remove remnant tags laterally near the Eustachian tube.
*   **Technique:** Held like a **dagger**. Introduced behind the soft palate, pressed against the nasopharyngeal roof, and swept downward.
*   **Clinical Implication:** Care must be taken to avoid damage to the Eustachian tube cushions (torus tubarius) laterally or the cervical spine posteriorly.

**2. Beckmann Adenoid Curette / Laforce Adenotome**
*   **Use:** Alternative instruments for shaving off adenoid tissue.

#### 4. Miscellaneous & Powered Instruments

**1. Luc’s Forceps**
*   **Description:** Fenestrated, cup-shaped jaws with sharp edges.
*   **Uses:**
    *   Removing adenoid tags.
    *   Grasping tonsils (alternative to Denis Browne).
    *   **Nasal Surgery:** Removing polyps, ethmoidal air cells, or the medial wall of the maxilla in [[Caldwell-Luc Operation]].
    *   Biopsy from oral cavity/pharynx.

**2. Peritonsillar Abscess Forceps (Lister's / St. Clair Thomson)**
*   **Description:** Bayonet-shaped sinus forceps with a sharp pointed tip.
*   **Use:** Drainage of **Quinsy** ([[Peritonsillar Abscess]]).
*   **Method:** Stab incision is made, forceps introduced closed, and then opened to dilate the track and release pus.

**3. Microdebrider (Shaver)**
*   **Mechanism:** Powered rotary shaving device with continuous suction.
*   **Uses:** Intracapsular tonsillectomy (tonsillotomy), Adenoidectomy, [[FESS]], Laryngeal papilloma.
*   **Advantage:** Precise removal, less thermal damage compared to cautery.

**4. Coblation Wand**
*   **Mechanism:** Uses radiofrequency energy to create a plasma field that dissociates molecular bonds (Cold Ablation ~60°C).
*   **Uses:** Tonsillectomy, Adenoidectomy, Palatal stiffening for snoring.
*   **Advantage:** Less postoperative pain and thermal injury.

**5. Harmonic Scalpel**
*   **Mechanism:** Ultrasonic vibrations (55,000 Hz) for simultaneous cutting and coagulation.
*   **Use:** Tonsillectomy, Thyroidectomy.
