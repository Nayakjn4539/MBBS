# [[Environment And Health]] > Medical Entomology Flies

### 1. Housefly (*Musca domestica*)

The housefly is a non-biting fly and is considered the most important insect from a public health standpoint because of its close association with human habitations and its role as a mechanical vector for numerous diseases.

**General Characteristics:**
*   **Habit:** It is a restless insect, constantly moving between filth (excreta) and food.
*   **Significance:** Its presence is regarded as a reliable [[Index of Insanitation]].
*   **Life Span:** Adult flies live for 15-25 days.

**Life Cycle:**
It undergoes complete metamorphosis with 4 stages:
1.  **Egg:** Laid in batches (120-150) on moist, decaying organic matter (horse manure is preferred). Hatch in 8-24 hours.
2.  **Larva (Maggot):** White, segmented, footless. Feeds voraciously on organic matter. Stage lasts 2-7 days.
3.  **Pupa:** Barrel-shaped, dark brown. Represents the resting stage. Lasts 3-6 days.
4.  **Adult:** Emerges from pupa. Life cycle completed in 5-6 days in summer (longer in winter).

**Modes of Transmission:**
Houseflies are called **"Porters of Infection"**. They transmit disease via:
1.  **Mechanical Transmission:** Pathogens stick to their hairy legs and body hairs.
2.  **[[Vomit Drop]]:** Flies cannot eat solid food; they regurgitate (vomit) stomach contents on solid food to liquefy it before sucking. This vomit is a rich bacterial culture.
3.  **Defecation:** Frequent defecation on food deposits cysts and bacteria.

**Diseases Transmitted:**
*   **Bacterial:** [[Typhoid]] and Paratyphoid fevers, Cholera, Bacillary Dysentery, Gastroenteritis, Anthrax, Yaws.
*   **Viral:** [[Poliomyelitis]], Viral Hepatitis A, Trachoma.
*   **Parasitic:** Amoebiasis, Giardiasis, Ascariasis (Roundworm), Hookworm.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Environmental Control (Best Method):** Sanitary disposal of human excreta (Sanitary latrines), proper disposal of garbage (composting, sanitary landfill), and stopping open defecation.
*   **Insecticidal Control:**
    *   *Residual Sprays:* Organophosphorus compounds like Malathion or Diazinon (Resistance to DDT is common).
    *   *Space Sprays:* Pyrethrum extract (knock-down effect).
    *   *Baits:* Sugar baits containing poison.
*   **Protection:** Screening of houses/hospitals, protecting food.
*   **Health Education:** Creating "Fly consciousness" among the public.

### 2. Sandfly (*Phlebotomus* & *Sergentomyia*)

Sandflies are small, hairy, biting flies (midge-like). In India, *Phlebotomus argentipes* is the most important vector.

**General Characteristics:**
*   **Morphology:** Small size (smaller than mosquitoes), hairy body and wings. Wings are lanceolate (upright V-shape) when resting.
*   **Habit:** They **hop** rather than fly. They cannot fly against the wind.
*   **Habitat:** They breed in cracks and crevices of walls, holes in trees, and dark/damp places.
*   **Biting:** Only **females bite** (hematophagous) to mature eggs. They are **nocturnal** biters (bite at night).

**Life Cycle:**
Complete metamorphosis (Egg $\rightarrow$ Larva $\rightarrow$ Pupa $\rightarrow$ Adult).
*   **Egg:** Laid in damp, dark places (cattle sheds). Hatch in 7 days.
*   **Larva:** Hairy maggot with long caudal bristles. Feeds on decaying organic matter.
*   **Adult:** Life span is about 2 weeks.

**Diseases Transmitted:**
1.  **[[Kala-azar]] (Visceral Leishmaniasis):** Transmitted by *Phlebotomus argentipes*.
2.  **[[Oriental Sore]] (Cutaneous Leishmaniasis):** Transmitted by *P. papatasii* and *P. sergenti*.
3.  **Sandfly Fever:** Transmitted by *P. papatasii*.
4.  **Oroya Fever (Carrion's Disease):** Found in South America.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Insecticides:** Sandflies are highly susceptible to **[[DDT]]**.
    *   *Technique:* Residual spraying of human dwellings and cattle sheds.
    *   *Height:* Spraying is done up to a height of **6 feet** from the floor (as they hop low and don't fly high).
*   **Sanitation:** Filling cracks and crevices in walls and floors (eliminating breeding sites). removal of shrubs/vegetation within 50 yards of dwellings.
*   **Personal Protection:** Use of fine-mesh mosquito nets (sandflies can pass through standard nets) and repellents.

### 3. Tsetse Fly (*Glossina*)

Tsetse flies are large biting flies restricted to **Africa**. They are the vectors of Sleeping Sickness.

**General Characteristics:**
*   **Appearance:** Yellow or dark brown, similar size to a housefly. Wings overlap like scissor blades when resting.
*   **Biting:** **Both sexes bite** (Male and Female) and suck blood, usually during the day.
*   **Species:**
    *   *G. palpalis* (Riverine species): Lives near water.
    *   *G. morsitans* (Savannah species): Lives in woodland vegetation.

**Life Cycle:**
Unique life cycle (**Larviparous**).
*   **Reproduction:** The female does **not lay eggs**. She gives birth to a single, fully developed living larva at a time (viviparous).
*   **Pupation:** The larva burrows into the soil and pupates immediately.
*   **Adult:** Emerges after 20-40 days.

**Diseases Transmitted:**
*   **African Trypanosomiasis ([[Sleeping Sickness]]):**
    *   *Trypanosoma gambiense* (transmitted by *G. palpalis*).
    *   *Trypanosoma rhodesiense* (transmitted by *G. morsitans*).

**Control Measures:**
*   **Insecticides:** DDT or Dieldrin spray (often by aircraft).
*   **Vegetation Clearing:** Clearing bush/vegetation around settlements to destroy habitats.
*   **Genetic Control:** Sterile male release technique.

### Clinical Relevance & Mnemonics

**Mnemonic for Housefly Diseases:**
**"Houseflies CARRY P.A.T.H.O.G.E.N.S"**
*   **C**holera
*   **A**moebiasis
*   **R**oundworm (Ascariasis)
*   **Y**aws
*   **P**olio
*   **A**nthrax
*   **T**rachoma / **T**yphoid
*   **H**epatitis A / **H**ookworm
*   **O**phthalmia
*   **G**astroenteritis / **G**iardiasis
*   **E**nteric fever (Typhoid)
*   **N**o bite (Mechanical vector)
*   **S**higellosis (Dysentery)

**Clinical Note for Sandfly:**
In India, the primary focus is **[[Kala-azar]]**. Remember that DDT spraying is still the insecticide of choice for *Phlebotomus argentipes* in many areas because resistance is less common compared to mosquitoes. The spraying height is restricted (up to 6 feet) because the fly is a "hopper," not a high flyer.
