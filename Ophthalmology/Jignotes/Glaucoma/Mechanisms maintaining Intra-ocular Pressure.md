# [[Glaucoma]] > Mechanisms maintaining Intra-ocular Pressure

# Physiology of Intraocular Pressure (IOP)

**Intraocular Pressure (IOP)** is the pressure exerted by the [[intraocular fluids]] on the coats of the eyeball. The maintenance of normal IOP is essentially a dynamic equilibrium between the production of [[aqueous humour]] and its drainage.

### Normal Values
*   **Normal Range:** 10–21 mm Hg.
*   **Mean IOP:** 16 ± 2.5 mm Hg.
*   **Nature:** IOP is pulsatile, reflecting vascular origin and blood flow effects.

### 1. Dynamics of Aqueous Humour
The [[aqueous humour]] is a clear watery fluid filling the [[anterior chamber]] (0.25 mL) and [[posterior chamber]] (0.06 mL). It serves metabolic functions for the avascular [[cornea]] and [[lens]] and maintains optical transparency and IOP.

#### A. Production of Aqueous Humour
*   **Site:** Secreted by the [[non-pigmented epithelium]] of the [[ciliary processes]] (pars plicata).
*   **Rate:** Approximately **2.3 $\mu$L/min**.
*   **Mechanisms of Formation:**
    1.  **Active Secretion (70%):** Energy-dependent process mediated by enzymes like **[[Na+-K+ ATPase]]** and **[[carbonic anhydrase]]**. It transports substances (Na+, Cl-, HCO3-, Ascorbate) against a concentration gradient into the posterior chamber, creating an osmotic gradient that draws water.
    2.  **Ultrafiltration (20%):** Passive process depending on hydrostatic pressure difference between ciliary capillaries and IOP.
    3.  **Diffusion (10%):** Passive movement of solutes.

#### B. Drainage of Aqueous Humour
Aqueous flows from the posterior chamber through the [[pupil]] into the anterior chamber. From there, it exits via two distinct pathways:

| Feature | **Trabecular Outflow (Conventional)** | **Uveoscleral Outflow (Unconventional)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Share of Drainage** | Major pathway (70–90%). | Minor pathway (10–30%). |
| **Pressure Dependence** | **Pressure Dependent** (Flow increases as IOP increases). | **Pressure Independent**. |
| **Pathway Route** | [[Trabecular meshwork]] $\rightarrow$ [[Schlemm's canal]] $\rightarrow$ [[Collector channels]] $\rightarrow$ [[Aqueous veins]] $\rightarrow$ [[Episcleral veins]]. | Ciliary body face $\rightarrow$ Suprachoroidal space $\rightarrow$ Venous circulation of ciliary body/choroid/sclera. |
| **Resistance Site** | **[[Juxtacanalicular meshwork]]** (cribriform layer) offers maximum resistance. | Tissue resistance within ciliary muscle bundles. |

**Clinical Implication:**
*   **[[Pilocarpine]]** (Miotics) increases **Trabecular outflow** by contracting the longitudinal ciliary muscle, which pulls on the [[scleral spur]] and opens the trabecular meshwork.
*   **[[Prostaglandin analogues]]** (e.g., [[Latanoprost]]) reduce IOP by increasing **Uveoscleral outflow**.

### 2. Factors Influencing Intraocular Pressure

Changes in IOP result from alterations in aqueous formation, outflow resistance, or episcleral venous pressure.

#### A. Local (Ocular) Factors
1.  **Resistance to Outflow:** This is the most important clinical factor. Obstruction at the trabecular meshwork (e.g., sclerosis, pigment, inflammatory cells) leads to raised IOP.
2.  **Rate of Aqueous Formation:** Depends on permeability of ciliary capillaries and blood osmotic pressure.
3.  **Episcleral Venous Pressure:** Normal is ~10 mm Hg. Elevations (e.g., in [[Carotid-cavernous fistula]], [[Sturge-Weber syndrome]], or Valsalva manoeuvre) cause a 1:1 rise in IOP.
4.  **Pupil Dilation:** In eyes with narrow angles, dilation crowds the iris into the angle, obstructing drainage (Angle-closure).
5.  **Refractive Errors:** IOP correlates with [[axial length]]; [[myopes]] tend to have higher IOP than emmetropes.

#### B. General (Systemic) Factors
1.  **Diurnal Variation:**
    *   IOP fluctuates cyclically.
    *   **Pattern:** Typically highest in the early morning and lowest in the late evening.
    *   **Mechanism:** Related to plasma [[cortisol]] levels and catecholamines.
    *   **Clinical Significance:** Fluctuation of **>5 mm Hg** is suspicious; **>8 mm Hg** is pathognomonic for [[glaucoma]].
2.  **Postural Variation:** IOP increases when changing from sitting to supine position (due to increased episcleral venous pressure).
3.  **Blood Pressure:** Has a minimal long-term effect, though a slight positive correlation exists.
4.  **Plasma Osmotic Pressure:** Inverse relationship.
    *   **Hypertonicity** (e.g., IV [[Mannitol]], oral [[Glycerol]]) draws water out of the eye, **lowering IOP**.
    *   **Hypotonicity** (e.g., water drinking test) **raises IOP**.
5.  **Age:** Mean IOP increases after age 40, likely due to reduced outflow facility.
6.  **Exercise:** Strenuous exercise transiently lowers IOP.

### 3. Measurement of IOP (Tonometry)

*   **Principle:** Based on the **Imbert-Fick Law** ($P = F/A$), where pressure in a sphere equals force divided by area flattened.
*   **Gold Standard:** **[[Goldmann Applanation Tonometer]]** (GAT).
*   **Factors affecting reading:**
    *   **[[Central Corneal Thickness]] (CCT):**
        *   Thick cornea $\rightarrow$ Artificially High IOP reading.
        *   Thin cornea (e.g., post-LASIK) $\rightarrow$ Artificially Low IOP reading.
    *   **Scleral Rigidity:** Affects indentation tonometry ([[Schiotz tonometer]]) more than applanation. High rigidity yields falsely high IOP.

| **Osmotic Gradient** | Plasma vs. Vitreous tonicity | **[[Hyperosmotic agents]]** (Mannitol) $\rightarrow$ Dehydrate vitreous $\rightarrow$ **Lower IOP**. |
