| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Urothelial Neoplasm (Bladder Cancer)** A group of tumors arising from the urothelium, representing about 90% of all bladder tumors. They range from benign, non-recurring lesions to aggressive, fatal cancers. | Caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Key etiologic agents include carcinogens from tobacco smoke, industrial aryl amines, chronic inflammation from infections like **Schistosoma haematobium**, and certain drugs. | * **Cigarette smoking** (most important, 3-7x increased risk) * Industrial exposure to **aryl amines** (e.g., 2-naphthylamine) * **Schistosoma haematobium** infection (endemic areas) * Long-term use of analgesics * Heavy, long-term exposure to **cyclophosphamide** * Pelvic irradiation * Higher incidence in men, higher income nations, urban dwellers | Two distinct molecular pathways: **1. Non-muscle-invasive papillary pathway:** Starts as papillary urothelial hyperplasia -> noninvasive papillary tumor. Driven by gain-of-function mutations in growth factor receptor pathways. Tumors often recur but infrequently progress to invade muscle. **2. "Flat" CIS pathway to muscle-invasive cancer:** Arises from flat urothelial carcinoma in situ (**CIS**). Driven by early loss of tumor suppressor genes. This pathway accounts for the majority of muscle-invasive bladder cancers. Progression involves invasion into lamina propria, then muscularis propria (detrusor muscle). | * **Papillary Pathway:** Gain-of-function alterations.   + Amplifications of **FGFR3** (fibroblast growth factor receptor 3) gene.   + Activating mutations in **RAS** and **PI3-kinase** genes. * **CIS/Invasive Pathway:** Loss-of-function mutations.   + Early mutations disrupting **TP53** and **RB** tumor suppressor genes. * **Small-cell variant:** Strongly associated with loss-of-function mutations in **TP53** and **RB**. | Varies from purely papillary to nodular or flat. Papillary lesions appear as red, elevated excrescences, ranging from <1 cm to 5 cm. Can be multifocal. Invasive tumors may appear as a large, ulcerated mass. | * **Papilloma:** Delicate papillary fronds lined by histologically normal urothelium. * **Papillary Urothelial Neoplasm of Low Malignant Potential (PUNLMP):** Similar to papilloma but with thicker urothelium and greater cell density. * **Low-Grade Papillary Carcinoma:** Orderly architecture, low-grade cytologic atypia, maintained polarity, scattered hyperchromatic nuclei, infrequent basal mitoses. * **High-Grade Papillary Carcinoma:** Dyscohesive cells, large hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular chromatin, prominent nucleoli, frequent/atypical mitoses, loss of polarity. * **Carcinoma in Situ (CIS):** Cytologically malignant cells within a flat urothelium. Lack of cohesiveness leads to shedding of cells. Can have **pagetoid spread**. Appears as mucosal reddening on cystoscopy. | **Painless hematuria** is the most common presenting symptom. Other symptoms may include urinary frequency, urgency, and dysuria. Obstruction of a ureteral orifice can lead to hydronephrosis or pyelonephritis. | Urine cytology can detect shed malignant cells, especially from high-grade tumors and CIS. | Grading based on WHO/ISUP system (2016):  * **Flat Lesions:** Urothelial dysplasia, Carcinoma in situ (CIS). * **Exophytic Papillary Lesions:** Papilloma, PUNLMP, Low-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma, High-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma.  Staging based on **pTNM system**, key determinant is invasion into muscularis propria (T2). | High rate of recurrence (up to 70%). Progression to higher grade or stage. Metastasis to regional lymph nodes, lung, liver. Variants include squamous cell carcinoma (associated with chronic irritation/schistosomiasis) and adenocarcinoma (can arise from urachal remnants). | * **Non-muscle-invasive:** Transurethral resection (TURBT). Intravesical instillation of **bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)** for high-risk tumors (e.g., CIS, high-grade) to elicit an inflammatory reaction that destroys the tumor. Lifelong surveillance cystoscopy. * **Muscle-invasive:** Radical cystectomy or radiation therapy, often with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. * **Metastatic:** Immune checkpoint inhibitors may be effective in a subset of patients. |
| **Cryptorchidism** Complete or partial failure of the intra-abdominal testes to descend into the scrotal sac. | Failure of one of the two phases of testicular descent. The first (transabdominal) phase is controlled by **müllerian-inhibiting substance**. The second (inguinoscrotal) phase is **androgen-dependent**. Believed to be part of an intrinsic defect in gonadal development (testicular dysgenesis syndrome). | Component of testicular dysgenesis syndrome. Possible association with in utero exposure to pesticides and nonsteroidal estrogens. | Testicular descent occurs in two phases. Arrest can happen anywhere along the pathway, most commonly in the inguinal canal. The higher temperature outside the scrotum leads to progressive degenerative changes in the testis starting from around 2 years of age. | - | Affected testes are small and firm. | Changes begin as early as 2 years old:   * **Thickening of the basement membrane** of the spermatic tubules. * Progressive loss of spermatogonia, leaving tubules lined only by Sertoli cells. * Advanced cases show hyalinized, scarred tubules appearing as dense cords. * Increase in interstitial stroma. * Leydig cells are spared and thus appear relatively prominent. | Asymptomatic. Discovered upon physical examination when the scrotal sac is found to be empty. | - | Usually unilateral, but bilateral in 25% of cases. | * **Sterility/Infertility** due to tubular atrophy. * **Increased risk of testicular cancer** (3 to 5-fold higher risk for germ cell tumors). * Associated with inguinal hernia (10-20% of cases). * Increased susceptibility to traumatic injury. | Surgical correction (orchiopexy) to place the testis in the scrotal sac, preferably performed between 6 and 12 months of age. This reduces but does not completely eliminate the risk of sterility and cancer. |
| **Nonspecific Epididymitis and Orchitis** Inflammation of the epididymis and/or testis, typically related to infections of the urinary tract that spread via the vas deferens or lymphatics. | Cause varies with age:   * **Children:** Gram-negative rods, usually associated with a congenital genitourinary abnormality. * **Men < 35 years:** Sexually transmitted pathogens, primarily **Chlamydia trachomatis** and **Neisseria gonorrhoeae**. * **Men > 35 years:** Common urinary tract pathogens like **E. coli** and **Pseudomonas**. | Congenital GU abnormalities, sexual activity (in younger men), underlying urinary tract pathology (in older men). | Bacterial infection induces an acute inflammatory reaction. The infection usually begins in the interstitial connective tissue of the epididymis and can then extend to involve the seminiferous tubules and the testis, sometimes leading to abscess formation. | - | Congestion and edema of the epididymis and testis. In severe cases, an abscess may be visible. | Acute inflammation with interstitial congestion, edema, and infiltration by **neutrophils**. In severe cases, there is suppurative necrosis of the epididymis. The process often extends to the testis. Later stages show fibrous scarring. Leydig cells are typically spared. | - (Implied testicular pain, swelling, and fever). | - | - | Abscess formation, suppurative necrosis of the entire epididymis, fibrous scarring which can lead to **sterility**. | Antibiotics targeted to the causative organism. |
| **Granulomatous (Autoimmune) Orchitis** An idiopathic, non-caseating granulomatous inflammation of the testis. | Unknown etiology, but an autoimmune basis is suspected. | - | - | - | Presents as a moderately tender or painless testicular mass, which can mimic a tumor. | Distinguished by **granulomas that are restricted to the spermatic tubules**. This helps differentiate it from mycobacterial (tuberculous) orchitis, which typically involves the epididymis first and shows caseous necrosis. | Usually presents in middle-aged men with a sudden onset of a moderately tender testicular mass, sometimes with fever. Can also present insidiously as a painless mass. | - | - | Clinically mimics a testicular tumor, which is its main importance. | - (Biopsy is done to rule out tumor). |
| **Testicular Torsion** A urologic emergency caused by twisting of the spermatic cord, which obstructs venous drainage and leads to hemorrhagic infarction of the testis. | * **"Adult" torsion (adolescence):** Results from a bilateral anatomic defect, the **'bell-clapper abnormality'**, which allows for increased testicular mobility. * **Neonatal torsion:** Occurs in utero or shortly after birth; lacks an associated anatomic defect. | **Bell-clapper abnormality**. | Twisting of the spermatic cord cuts off venous outflow. The thick-walled arteries often remain patent, leading to intense vascular engorgement, followed by hemorrhagic infarction of the testis. If not corrected promptly, this leads to necrosis. | - | The morphologic changes range from intense congestion to widespread hemorrhage and infarction, depending on the duration of torsion. In advanced stages, the testis is swollen and consists of soft, necrotic, hemorrhagic tissue with a dark discoloration. | - (Implied widespread hemorrhagic necrosis). | Sudden onset of severe testicular pain. Typically occurs in adolescents, often without any inciting injury. Neonatal torsion presents at or near birth. | - | Neonatal torsion, "Adult" torsion. | Hemorrhagic infarction and loss of the testis. | Emergency surgical intervention. If manually untwisted within approximately 6 hours, the testis may be salvaged. If infarcted, an orchiectomy is performed. A contralateral orchiopexy is done to fix the unaffected testis and prevent future torsion. |
| **Germ Cell Tumours (GCTs)** Neoplasms arising from germ cells, accounting for 95% of all testicular tumors. They are the most common cancer in males aged 15-45. | Result from an interplay of environmental exposures and inherited/acquired genetic factors. The precursor lesion is believed to be an abnormal primordial germ cell. | * **Cryptorchidism** (most important). * **Testicular dysgenesis syndrome** (cryptorchidism, hypospadias, poor sperm quality). * History of GCT in the contralateral testis. * Family history of testicular cancer. * Caucasian race. * Infertility. * **Klinefelter syndrome** (increased risk for mediastinal, but not testicular, GCTs). | A step-wise model is proposed:  1. An in utero defect in primordial germ cell differentiation leads to an arrested, abnormal cell.  2. Activation of growth factor signaling (e.g., via KIT mutation) stimulates proliferation, forming the precursor lesion, **Germ Cell Neoplasia In Situ (GCNIS)**.  3. At puberty, hormonal stimulation promotes progression of GCNIS to invasive GCT.  4. This progression is strongly associated with the acquisition of additional genetic changes, most importantly **isochromosome 12p (i12p)**. | * **Isochromosome 12p (i12p):** A cytogenetic alteration involving reduplication of the short arm of chromosome 12, invariably found in invasive GCTs arising from GCNIS. * Activating mutations in the **KIT** receptor tyrosine kinase gene are involved in the genesis of GCNIS. * Germline variants in genes like **KIT** and **BAK** increase risk. * Lesional cells of GCNIS retain expression of pluripotency transcription factors **OCT3/4** and **NANOG**. | Any solid testicular mass is considered neoplastic until proven otherwise. Appearance varies by subtype (see specific tumors). | The universal precursor lesion for most adult GCTs is **Germ Cell Neoplasia in Situ (GCNIS)**, found in adjacent seminiferous tubules. Specific histologic features vary by tumor type. | Painless enlargement of the testis is the most characteristic feature. Any solid testicular mass should be considered a tumor. | Serum Biomarkers:   * **α-fetoprotein (AFP):** Produced by yolk sac tumor elements. * **Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG):** Produced by syncytiotrophoblasts (in choriocarcinomas and some seminomas). * **Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH):** Correlates with tumor mass/burden.  These are used for diagnosis, staging, assessing tumor burden, and monitoring therapeutic response. | * **Seminomatous tumors** (Seminoma) * **Nonseminomatous GCTs (NSGCT)** (Embryonal carcinoma, Yolk sac tumor, Choriocarcinoma, Teratoma) * **Mixed GCTs** (contain more than one histologic type, ~60% of cases) * Also categorized by origin: Derived from GCNIS vs. Unrelated to GCNIS (e.g., spermatocytic tumor, prepubertal teratoma). | Metastasis. Lymphatic spread is common, typically to retroperitoneal para-aortic nodes first. Hematogenous spread occurs primarily to the lungs, but also liver, brain, and bones. NSGCTs tend to metastasize earlier and more often via hematogenous routes. | Standard management for a solid testicular mass is **radical orchiectomy**. Biopsy is avoided due to risk of tumor spillage. Further therapy depends on histologic type and clinical stage. Seminomas are highly radiosensitive and chemosensitive. NSGCTs are treated with aggressive chemotherapy. |
| **Seminoma** The most common type of GCT (~50%), composed of cells that resemble primordial germ cells. Identical to dysgerminoma in the ovary. | - (As per general GCTs). Arises from GCNIS. | - (As per general GCTs). Peak incidence in the fourth decade. | - (As per general GCTs pathogenesis, progresses from GCNIS). | Has i12p. Tumor cells are positive for KIT, OCT3/4, and podoplanin on immunohistochemistry. Negative for cytokeratin. | Bulky mass, sometimes 10x the size of the normal testis. Has a homogeneous, gray-white, lobulated cut surface, usually devoid of hemorrhage or necrosis. | * Composed of sheets of uniform cells divided into poorly demarcated lobules by delicate fibrous septa. * The septa contain a characteristic lymphocytic infiltrate; granulomas may also be present. * Classic seminoma cell: round to polyhedral, distinct cell membrane, clear or watery-appearing cytoplasm (containing glycogen), and a large central nucleus with one or two prominent nucleoli. * ~15% of cases contain syncytiotrophoblasts. | Painless testicular mass. | * **AFP is always negative.** A positive AFP level rules out a pure seminoma. * **hCG** may be elevated in the ~15% of cases that contain syncytiotrophoblasts. * LDH may be elevated. | A pure form of seminomatous GCT. | Tends to remain localized for a long time. Metastasizes primarily via lymphatics to para-aortic nodes. Hematogenous spread occurs late. | Highly radiosensitive and chemosensitive. Treatment consists of orchiectomy, with or without radiotherapy or chemotherapy depending on stage. Excellent prognosis (>95% of patients with stage I/II tumors are cured). |
| **Spermatocytic Tumour** An uncommon, slow-growing GCT occurring in older men that is distinct from classic seminoma. | Pathogenesis is distinct from other GCTs; it is not associated with GCNIS. | Older age (usually > 65 years). | - | Lacks isochromosome 12p. Characteristically associated with gain of chromosome 9q. | Circumscribed, fleshy tumor; can be myxoid or cystic. | Characteristically contains three intermixed cell populations:  1. Medium-sized cells with a round nucleus and spireme-type chromatin. 2. Smaller cells resembling secondary spermatocytes. 3. Scattered giant cells.  Uniformly lacks inflammatory infiltrates and syncytiotrophoblasts. | Slowly growing testicular mass in an older man. | Serum tumor markers (AFP, hCG) are not elevated. | A GCT that is unrelated to GCNIS. | Excellent prognosis; does not metastasize. | Surgical resection (orchiectomy) is curative. |
| **Embryonal Carcinoma** An aggressive GCT composed of undifferentiated cells resembling embryonic stem cells. | - (As per general GCTs). Arises from GCNIS. | - (As per general GCTs). Peak incidence in the 20-30 year old age group. | - (As per general GCTs pathogenesis). More aggressive than seminoma. | Has i12p. Positive for OCT3/4 and cytokeratin. Negative for KIT. | Often has a variegated appearance with foci of hemorrhage and necrosis. Tends to be smaller but more aggressive than seminoma, frequently extending through the tunica albuginea. | * Cells grow in alveolar or tubular patterns, or as sheets with cleft-like spaces. * Neoplastic cells are large and anaplastic, with an epithelial appearance. * They have hyperchromatic nuclei with prominent nucleoli and indistinct cell borders. * Marked pleomorphism, frequent mitotic figures, and tumor giant cells are common. * Vascular-lymphatic invasion is common. | Presents as a painful or tender testicular mass. More aggressive clinical course. | AFP and/or hCG may be elevated (especially in mixed tumors with yolk sac or choriocarcinoma elements). | A type of nonseminomatous GCT. Can be "pure" or, more commonly, a component of a mixed tumor. | Aggressive and metastasizes early via both lymphatic and hematogenous routes. | Radical orchiectomy followed by aggressive chemotherapy. |
| **Yolk Sac Tumour (Endodermal Sinus Tumour)** A GCT that recapitulates the embryonic yolk sac. It is the most common testicular tumor in infants and children <3 years old. | Prepubertal type is not associated with GCNIS. Postpubertal type (seen in adults) arises from GCNIS. | Age < 3 years for prepubertal type. | - | Postpubertal type has i12p. Prepubertal type does not. | - | * Composed of a lace-like (reticular) network of medium-sized cuboidal or flattened cells. * **Schiller-Duval bodies** are pathognomonic (found in ~50%): a central capillary surrounded by tumor cells, resembling a primitive glomerulus. * Eosinophilic, hyaline-like globules containing **AFP** and **α₁-antitrypsin** are typically seen. * Stains positive for AFP and cytokeratin. | Testicular mass. In infants, has a very good prognosis. In adults, it is rarely "pure" and is usually part of a more aggressive mixed GCT. | Characteristic elevation of serum **AFP**. | A type of nonseminomatous GCT. Can be prepubertal (benign course) or postpubertal (malignant, usually mixed). | - | Orchiectomy. In children, this is often curative. In adults, treatment is for the mixed GCT. |
| **Choriocarcinoma** A highly malignant GCT composed of cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts. Rare in pure form (<1% of GCTs). | - (As per general GCTs). Arises from GCNIS. | - | - | Has i12p. | Typically small primary tumors, often with extensive **hemorrhage and necrosis**. | Composed of two intimately juxtaposed cell types:  1. **Syncytiotrophoblasts:** Large, multinucleated cells with abundant, eosinophilic, vacuolated cytoplasm. They contain and produce hCG. 2. **Cytotrophoblasts:** More regular, polygonal cells with distinct borders, clear cytoplasm, and a single nucleus. Grow in cords or sheets. | Can present with symptoms of metastatic disease (e.g., hemoptysis, neurologic symptoms) rather than a palpable testicular mass, as the primary tumor can be small or may have regressed. | **Invariably elevated, often markedly high, serum hCG**. | A type of nonseminomatous GCT. Can be "pure" or a component of a mixed tumor. | Extremely aggressive with rapid and widespread hematogenous metastasis, often with hemorrhage at metastatic sites (lungs, liver, brain). Poor prognosis. | Radical orchiectomy and aggressive combination chemotherapy. |
| **Teratoma** A GCT containing differentiated cells or organoid structures from two or more germ layers (ectoderm, endoderm, mesoderm). | Prepubertal type is not associated with GCNIS. Postpubertal (adult) type arises from GCNIS and is considered malignant. | - | Represents differentiation of pluripotent cancer cells along somatic cell lines. Postpubertal teratomas, whether mature or immature, are considered malignant as they can metastasize. | Postpubertal types have i12p. Malignant somatic components that arise within a teratoma also retain i12p, proving a clonal relationship. | Large tumors (5-10 cm) with a heterogeneous appearance, containing solid, sometimes cartilaginous, and cystic areas. | A haphazard collection of differentiated tissues, which can be mature (resembling adult tissues like cartilage, squamous epithelium, neural tissue, glands) or immature (resembling fetal or embryonic tissue). | Presents as a testicular mass. In children, pure teratomas are benign. In postpubertal adults, all teratomas are considered malignant with metastatic potential. | Tumor markers (AFP, hCG) are typically negative in pure teratomas, but may be elevated if it is part of a mixed GCT. | A type of nonseminomatous GCT.   * **Prepubertal type:** benign course. * **Postpubertal type:** malignant potential. * **Teratoma with somatic-type malignant transformation:** A non-germ cell cancer (e.g., sarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma) arising within the teratoma. | Metastasis of teratoma elements. Development of somatic-type malignancies, which are often chemoresistant. | Orchiectomy. Resection of metastases is crucial, especially for somatic-type malignancies. |
| **Leydig Cell Tumour** A tumor of the sex cord-gonadal stroma arising from interstitial Leydig cells, often producing androgens or estrogens. | - | Associated with Klinefelter syndrome, cryptorchidism, and hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma syndrome. | - | Germline mutations in fumarate hydratase (FH) gene in the associated hereditary syndrome. | Circumscribed nodule, usually < 5cm. Has a distinctive golden brown, homogeneous cut surface. | * Tumor cells resemble normal Leydig cells: large, polygonal, with abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and a round central nucleus. * Cytoplasm frequently contains lipid droplets or lipofuscin pigment. * **Crystalloids of Reinke** (rod-shaped intracytoplasmic inclusions) are pathognomonic but seen in only about 25% of cases. | Most common feature is testicular swelling. Hormonal effects can be the dominant feature: sexual precocity in children, or gynecomastia in adults due to estrogen production. ~10% are malignant in adults. | Elevated serum levels of androgens or estrogens. | A type of sex cord-gonadal stromal tumor. | Metastasis (in 10% of adult cases). | Orchiectomy. |
| **Sertoli Cell Tumour** A sex cord-gonadal stromal tumor composed of Sertoli cells, which are typically hormonally silent. | - | Associated with Carney complex, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and familial adenomatosis polyposis syndrome. | - | Germline mutations in PRKAR1A gene are associated with Carney complex. | Firm, small nodules with a homogeneous gray-white to yellow cut surface. | Tumor cells are arranged in distinctive trabeculae that tend to form cord-like structures and tubules, resembling primitive seminiferous tubules. | Usually presents as a painless testicular mass. Most are benign, but approximately 10% pursue a malignant course. | - | A type of sex cord-gonadal stromal tumor. | Malignancy and metastasis in ~10% of cases. | Orchiectomy. |
| **Gonadoblastoma** A rare neoplasm composed of a mixture of germ cells and gonadal stromal elements. | Almost always arises in individuals with some form of testicular dysgenesis. | Testicular dysgenesis. | - | - | - | Mixture of germ cells (similar to seminoma cells) and sex cord-stromal cells (resembling immature Sertoli or granulosa cells) in discrete nests. | - | - | A mixed germ cell and sex cord-stromal tumor. | The germ cell component frequently becomes malignant, giving rise to an overlying seminoma. | - |
| **Testicular Lymphoma** The most common form of testicular neoplasm in men older than 60. | Metastatic involvement of the testis by a systemic lymphoma. | Age > 60 years. | - | - | Diffuse enlargement of the testis. Often bilateral. | Interstitial infiltrate of malignant lymphoid cells. The specific appearance depends on the lymphoma subtype. | Testicular mass. Often presents with disseminated disease. | - | Most common types are diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and EBV-positive extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma. | Aggressive tumors that are often disseminated at detection. High propensity for central nervous system involvement, which is a frequent site of recurrence. | Systemic chemotherapy for the specific type of lymphoma. |
| **Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)** Also known as nodular hyperplasia, it is the most common benign prostatic disease in men >50 years, characterized by proliferation of stromal and glandular elements. It is NOT a premalignant lesion. | The ultimate cause is unknown, but proliferation is driven by androgens, particularly dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and influenced by estrogens. | Age older than 50 years. | Pathogenesis is centered on DHT:  1. In prostatic stromal cells, testosterone is converted to the more potent DHT by the enzyme type 2 5α-reductase. 2. DHT binds to androgen receptors in both stromal and epithelial cells. 3. This stimulates the production of growth factors (e.g., FGFs) which act in a paracrine manner to increase the proliferation of stromal cells and decrease the death of epithelial cells, leading to nodular enlargement. Estrogens also contribute by tipping the balance towards proliferation. | - | Enlargement of the prostate, originating in the inner transition zone. The gland is enlarged (often 60-100 g) with a nodular consistency. The nodules compress the urethra into a slit-like orifice. Cut section shows nodules that are either yellow-pink and soft (glandular) or pale gray and firm (fibromuscular). | Composed of hyperplastic nodules containing glands and stroma.   * Glands can be small to large or cystically dilated. They show papillary infoldings. * Crucially, glands are lined by two cell layers: an inner columnar secretory layer and an outer cuboidal or flattened basal layer. The presence of the basal layer distinguishes BPH from cancer. * The glands are separated by fibromuscular stroma. | Symptoms are due to urinary obstruction:  * Increased urinary frequency, nocturia. * Difficulty in starting and stopping the stream of urine. * Overflow dribbling, dysuria (painful micturition). * Acute urinary retention can occur. | Serum PSA may be moderately elevated, but this is not specific and overlaps significantly with prostate cancer. | - | Urinary retention, leading to bladder hypertrophy and trabeculation. Residual urine is a source for recurrent urinary tract infections (bladder, kidney). Prostatic infarcts. | * **Medical:** **α₁-adrenergic blockers** to relax prostatic smooth muscle, and **5α-reductase inhibitors** to decrease DHT production and shrink the prostate. * **Surgical/Invasive:** **Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)**, laser therapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). |
| **Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate** A malignant tumor arising from the prostatic glands (acinar cells), it is the most common cancer in men in the US. | An interplay of environmental factors (e.g., "Western diet," carcinogens, inflammation) and inherited genetic predispositions. Androgens are critical for growth and survival. | * Advancing age. * African American ethnicity. * Family history of prostate cancer. | Develops through a stepwise accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations.  The putative precursor lesion is prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). A common early event is a chromosomal rearrangement creating the TMPRSS2-ETS fusion gene (e.g., TMPRSS2-ERG), which places an oncogene under androgen control. Another early event is epigenetic silencing of the tumor suppressor gene GSTP1. Further alterations include loss of tumor suppressors like PTEN. In late-stage disease, loss of TP53 and RB and amplification of the Androgen Receptor (AR) gene are common, leading to castration-resistant disease. | * **Acquired Somatic:**   + TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene (~50% of cases).   + Deletions of PTEN.   + Loss of TP53 and RB (late stage).   + Amplification of MYC and AR genes (late stage). * **Epigenetic:** Hypermethylation and silencing of the GSTP1 promoter is a frequent early event. * **Inherited Germline:** Variants in HOXB13, BRCA2, and DNA mismatch repair genes (Lynch syndrome) confer higher risk. | Typically arises in the outer, peripheral zone of the prostate, classically in a posterior location. The neoplastic tissue feels gritty and firm but is often difficult to visualize on gross examination. | * Consists of malignant glands that are typically smaller and more crowded than benign glands. * Malignant glands are lined by a single, uniform layer of cuboidal epithelium; the outer basal cell layer is characteristically absent. * Nuclei are enlarged and often contain one or more large, prominent nucleoli. * **Perineural invasion** is a highly specific feature. * Grading is done using the **Gleason system**, which is based on glandular architecture (from well-formed glands (Grade 1) to sheets of cells (Grade 5)). Scores are combined into Gleason Grade Groups (1-5). * Immunohistochemistry: Malignant glands are negative for basal cell markers (e.g., p63) and positive for AMACR. | Localized cancer is often asymptomatic. It may be discovered by detection of a palpable nodule on digital rectal examination or, more commonly, by an elevated serum PSA level. Advanced disease can cause symptoms of urinary obstruction or bone pain from metastases. | Serum **Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)**. PSA is an androgen-regulated product of prostatic epithelium. It is organ-specific but not cancer-specific. It is used for screening (controversially), diagnosis, and monitoring for recurrence after treatment. | * **Gleason Grading System/Grade Groups (1-5)** * **pTNM Pathologic Staging** * Variants include ductal adenocarcinoma and small-cell (neuroendocrine) carcinoma. | Local invasion into periprostatic tissue, seminal vesicles, and bladder base. Lymphatic metastasis to obturator nodes. Hematogenous spread occurs chiefly to the bones (especially axial skeleton), where metastases are typically osteoblastic (bone-forming). | * **Localized disease:** Can range from active surveillance for low-risk tumors to radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy (external beam or brachytherapy) for higher-risk tumors. * **Metastatic disease:** Treated with androgen deprivation therapy (surgical castration or medical castration with LHRH agonists). Most tumors eventually become castration-resistant and progress. |
