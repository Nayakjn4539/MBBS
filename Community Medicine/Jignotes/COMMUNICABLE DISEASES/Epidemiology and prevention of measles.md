# Epidemiology and Prevention of Measles

**Measles** (Rubeola) is an acute, highly infectious disease caused by a specific virus of the group **myxoviruses**. It is a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in developing countries.

### 1. Epidemiological Determinants

#### A. Agent Factors
*   **Agent:** RNA [[Paramyxovirus]] (Genus: Morbillivirus).
*   **Source of Infection:** A case of measles. **Carriers are not known to occur**.
*   **Infective Material:** Secretions of the nose, throat, and respiratory tract.
*   **Communicability:** Highly infectious. The period of communicability is **4 days before and 5 days after** the appearance of the rash.
*   **Secondary Attack Rate (SAR):** >80% (Some sources cite ~90%).
*   **Survival:** The virus cannot survive outside the human body for long (less than 2 hours).

#### B. Host Factors
*   **Age:** Affects virtually everyone in infancy or childhood. In developing countries, it is common between **6 months and 3 years**. In developed countries, it occurs in older children (>5 years).
*   **Immunity:** One attack confers **life-long immunity**. Infants are protected by maternal antibodies up to 6 months.
*   **Nutrition:** Measles is severe in malnourished children (especially **Protein Energy Malnutrition**). Mortality is up to 400 times higher in malnourished children. It may precipitate malnutrition and Vitamin A deficiency.

#### C. Environmental Factors
*   **Season:** Winter and early spring.
*   **Cyclical Trend:** Epidemics tend to occur every **2–3 years**.

### 2. Transmission Dynamics
*   **Mode of Transmission:** Directly from person to person mainly by **droplet infection** and **droplet nuclei**.
*   **Portal of Entry:** Respiratory tract and conjunctiva.
*   **Incubation Period:**
    *   Usually **10 days** from exposure to onset of fever.
    *   **14 days** to the appearance of the rash.
    *   **7 days** for vaccine-induced measles.

---

### 3. Clinical Features
The natural history is divided into three stages:

**1. Prodromal (Pre-eruptive) Stage:**
*   Lasts until day 14.
*   Characterized by **Fever**, **Coryza**, **Sneezing**, **Cough**, **Redness of eyes** (Conjunctivitis), and **Photophobia**.
*   **[[Koplik's Spots]]:** Pathognomonic sign. Small bluish-white spots on a red base (like table salt crystals) appearing on the buccal mucosa opposite the first and second lower molars a day or two before the rash.

**2. Eruptive Phase:**
*   Typical dusky-red, **maculo-papular rash**.
*   Starts **behind the ears** -> spreads to face/neck -> trunk -> extremities (Centrifugal spread).
*   Rash fades in the same order leaving brownish discoloration.

**3. Post-measles Stage:**
*   Child loses weight and remains weak (anergy/loss of immunity).
*   Reactivation of pulmonary tuberculosis may occur.

> **Clinical Relevance:** Diagnosis is based on the typical rash and [[Koplik's spots]]. In febrile exanthem where cough and red eyes are absent, measles is unlikely.

### 4. Complications
Complications occur in ~30% of cases.

| System | Complications |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Respiratory** | **[[Otitis media]]** (Most common in young children), Pneumonia (Most common cause of death), Laryngotracheobronchitis (Croup). |
| **Gastrointestinal** | **Diarrhea** (Common in developing countries), Cancrum oris. |
| **Neurological** | Febrile convulsions, Encephalitis, **[[Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis]] (SSPE)**. |

*Note: SSPE is a rare, fatal degenerative CNS disease developing 7–10 years after infection.*

### 5. Prevention: Immunization

Measles is best prevented by active immunization using the **[[Measles Vaccine]]**.

#### The Vaccine Profile
| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Type** | **Live Attenuated** Vaccine (Lyophilized/Freeze-dried). |
| **Strain** | **Edmonston-Zagreb** (Most common in India), Schwartz, Moraten. |
| **Dose** | **0.5 ml**. |
| **Route** | **Subcutaneous**. |
| **Site** | Right upper arm. |
| **Diluent** | **Distilled Water** (Sterile water). |
| **Storage** | **+2°C to +8°C** (Cold Chain is critical). |
| **Use Time** | Must be used within **4 hours** of reconstitution (Risk of [[Toxic Shock Syndrome]] if kept longer). |

#### National Immunization Schedule (India)
*   **1st Dose:** At **9 completed months** to 12 months.
    *   *Why 9 months?* Maternal antibodies neutralize the vaccine virus before this age.
*   **2nd Dose:** At **16–24 months** (Given as MR/MMR).

#### Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI)
*   Mild "measles-like" illness (fever/rash) 5–10 days after vaccination.
*   **[[Toxic Shock Syndrome]] (TSS):** Severe diarrhea, vomiting, and shock if non-sterile/outdated reconstituted vaccine is used.

#### Contraindications
*   Pregnancy.
*   Immune deficiency (e.g., severe HIV, steroid therapy).
*   Acute severe illness.

### 6. Vitamin A Supplementation
Vitamin A deficiency is a risk factor for severe measles. WHO recommends Vitamin A dosing to prevent corneal scarring and blindness.

**Dosage Schedule:**
*   **< 6 months:** 50,000 IU
*   **6 months – 11 months:** 100,000 IU
*   **≥ 12 months:** 200,000 IU
*   *Protocol:* Give immediately on diagnosis and repeat the next day. If eye signs (Bitot's spots) are present, give a 3rd dose 4-6 weeks later.

### 7. Outbreak Control Measures
1.  **Isolation:** For 7 days after the onset of rash.
2.  **Immunization of Contacts:** Vaccinate eligible contacts within **2 days** of exposure (Incubation period of vaccine is shorter ~7 days vs natural disease ~10 days).
3.  **[[Immunoglobulin]]:** Give to susceptible contacts (like pregnant women) within **3–4 days** of exposure. Dose: 0.25 ml/kg.
4.  **Catch-up Campaigns:** Rapid immunization of all children 9 months to 10 years.
