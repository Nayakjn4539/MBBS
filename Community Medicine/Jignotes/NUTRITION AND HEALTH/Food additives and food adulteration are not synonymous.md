# [[NUTRITION AND HEALTH]] > Food additives and food adulteration are not synonymous

### **Food Additives vs. Food Adulteration**

Though both concepts involve the addition of substances to food, they differ fundamentally in **intent**, **nature**, and **legality**.

#### **1. Food Additives**
[[Food Additives]] are defined as non-nutritious substances added intentionally to food, generally in small quantities, to improve its **appearance**, **flavour**, **texture**, or **storage properties**.

*   **Characteristics:**
    *   They are added to maintain or improve the quality of the diet.
    *   They are regulated by laws (e.g., FSSAI in India) and must be within permissible limits.
*   **Classification:**
    1.  **Category 1 (Safe/Permitted):** Colouring agents (e.g., Saffron, Turmeric), Flavouring agents (e.g., Vanilla), Sweeteners (e.g., Saccharin), Preservatives (e.g., Sodium benzoate, Sorbic acid).
    2.  **Category 2 (Contaminants):** Incidental additives through packing, processing, or farming (e.g., pesticide residues).

> **Note:** Uncontrolled use of additives (e.g., Nitrites/Nitrates) can lead to the formation of toxic substances like [[Nitrosamines]] which are carcinogenic.

#### **2. Food Adulteration**
[[Food Adulteration]] consists of a large number of practices such as **mixing**, **substitution**, **removal**, concealing the quality, putting up decomposed foods for sale, misbranding, or giving false labels.

*   **Characteristics:**
    *   It reduces the quality or nature of the food substance.
    *   It often results in economic loss to the consumer (paying more for lower quality) and can be injurious to health.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Mixing water with milk.
    *   Mixing [[Argemone oil]] with mustard oil (causing [[Epidemic Dropsy]]).
    *   Removal of fat from milk.

#### **3. The Crucial Distinction (Why they are not synonymous)**
The primary difference is the **legality** and **permissibility**.

*   Food additives are generally considered safe and legal **IF** they are permitted and used within specific limits.
*   However, an additive becomes an adulterant in two specific scenarios:
    1.  If the food contains additives that are **not permitted**.
    2.  If the **permissible limit** of a legal additive is exceeded.

Therefore, while all unauthorized additives result in adulteration, not all additives are adulterants.

### **Comparison Table**

| Feature | **Food Additives** | **Food Adulteration** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | Non-nutritious substances added to improve flavor, texture, or storage. | Practices like mixing, substitution, or removal that lower food quality. |
| **Intent** | Constructive: To preserve or enhance food quality. | Deceptive: Economic gain or negligence. |
| **Safety** | Generally safe if used within limits (e.g., Preservatives). | Often unsafe or injurious to health (e.g., Toxicants). |
| **Legality** | Permitted under Food Safety Acts (e.g., FSSAI). | Illegal and punishable by law (e.g., [[PFA Act]]). |
| **Examples** | Sodium benzoate in jams, Vanilla essence in cakes. | Water in milk, Brick powder in chilli powder. |

### **Clinical Relevance**
*   **Health Hazards:** While additives are regulated to be safe, adulteration leads to specific disease outbreaks.
    *   *Mustard Oil + Argemone Oil* $\rightarrow$ **Epidemic Dropsy** (Toxin: [[Sanguinarine]]).
    *   *Khesari Dal + Arhar Dal* $\rightarrow$ **Neurolathyrism** (Toxin: [[BOAA]]).
*   **Public Health Response:** Enforcement of the **Food Safety and Standards Act** (FSSAI) is crucial to monitor both the limits of additives and the prevention of adulteration.
