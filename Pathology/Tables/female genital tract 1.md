| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection** A common DNA virus infection of the vulva, vagina, or cervix, leading to genital ulcerations. | Infection by **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)**, a DNA virus. **HSV-1** typically perioral, **HSV-2** typically genital, but can be interchanged based on sexual practices. Transmitted by sexual contact. | Immunosuppression (for recurrences). Initial (primary) infection during delivery poses the highest risk for neonatal transmission. | 1. Virus transmitted through contact with active lesions.  2. Incubation for 3-7 days, then development of red papules that progress to vesicles and painful coalescent ulcers.  3. Virus enters regional lumbosacral nerve ganglia, establishing a **latent infection**.  4. Any decrease in immune function (stress, trauma, other infections) can trigger viral reactivation and recurrence of lesions. | - | Lesions begin as **red papules**, progressing to **vesicles** and then to **painful coalescent ulcers**. Easily visible on vulvar skin and mucosa. Cervical/vaginal lesions may present with purulent discharge. | Typically shows an ulcerated lesion with desquamated epithelium and marked acute inflammation in the ulcer bed.  **Cytopathic changes** on smears from active lesions show **multinucleated squamous cells** containing eosinophilic to basophilic viral inclusions with a characteristic "**ground-glass**" appearance. | About one-third are symptomatic.  Systemic symptoms: fever, malaise, tender inguinal lymph nodes.  Local symptoms: painful coalescent ulcers, purulent discharge, pelvic pain, painful urination, urine retention. | Detection via tissue culture (viral cytopathic effect in 48-72 hrs), PCR tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, direct immunofluorescent antibody tests.  Serum anti-HSV antibodies indicate recurrent/latent infection, not primary acute infection. | Two serotypes: **HSV-1** and **HSV-2**. | Transmission to the neonate during birth. Increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition and transmission. Recurrent infections. | Antiviral agents like **acyclovir** or **famciclovir** shorten the length of symptomatic phases. Cesarean delivery is warranted if infection is active during delivery. |
| **Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)** An infection that begins in the vulva or vagina and spreads upward to involve most structures in the female genital system. | **Neisseria gonorrhoeae** (common cause).  **Chlamydia trachomatis**.  **Puerperal infections** (post-abortion/delivery) are typically polymicrobial: staphylococci, streptococci, coliforms, **Clostridium perfringens**. | Gonorrhea, chlamydia infections. Spontaneous or induced abortions. Normal or abnormal deliveries. Dilation and curettage of the uterus and other surgical procedures. | **Gonococcal PID:** Infection begins 2-7 days after inoculation in endocervical mucosa, Bartholin gland, etc. Organisms spread upward to fallopian tubes (acute suppurative salpingitis) and tubo-ovarian region, mainly on mucosal surfaces.  **Non-gonococcal PID:** Spread occurs upward from the uterus through lymphatics or venous channels, causing more inflammation in deeper tissue layers (serosa, broad ligaments) rather than just the mucosa. | - | **Acute salpingitis:** Dilated tubal lumen, edematous and congested tubal plicae. Tubal lumen filled with purulent exudate.  **Pyosalpinx:** Accumulation of pus in the tubal lumen.  **Tubo-ovarian abscess:** Collection of pus in ovary and tube.  **Hydrosalpinx:** Tubal distention with secretions due to fimbrial fusion. | **Gonococcal:** Marked acute inflammation of mucosal surfaces. Phagocytosed gram-negative diplococci within neutrophils. In fallopian tubes, mucosa is congested, infiltrated by neutrophils, plasma cells, lymphocytes, leading to epithelial injury.  **Chronic salpingitis:** Fused tubal plicae forming glandlike spaces and blind pouches due to scarring. | Pelvic pain, adnexal tenderness, fever, and vaginal discharge. | **Gonococcal:** Culture or detection of gonococcal RNA or DNA is required for definitive diagnosis. Smears show gram-negative diplococci in neutrophils. | Categorized by causative agent (e.g., gonococcal, chlamydial, puerperal). | **Acute:** Peritonitis, bacteremia (leading to endocarditis, meningitis, suppurative arthritis).  **Chronic:** Infertility, tubal obstruction, ectopic pregnancy, pelvic pain, intestinal obstruction from adhesions. | Antibiotics. Surgical removal of organs may be necessary for walled-off tubo-ovarian abscesses. |
| **Vulvar Intraepithelial Neoplasia (VIN)** A premalignant precursor lesion to vulvar squamous cell carcinoma. | **Classic VIN:** Infection with high-risk HPV, most commonly **HPV-16**.  **Differentiated VIN:** Not related to HPV. Associated with long-standing lichen sclerosus or squamous cell hyperplasia. | **Classic VIN:** Same as cervical cancer (young age at first intercourse, multiple sexual partners), immunosuppression, age >45 years.  **Differentiated VIN:** Lichen sclerosus or squamous cell hyperplasia. | **Classic VIN:** High-risk HPV infection leads to a precursor lesion. Risk of progression to invasive carcinoma is higher in women >45 years or who are immunosuppressed.  **Differentiated VIN:** Chronic epithelial irritation is thought to contribute to a gradual evolution to a malignant phenotype through the acquisition of driver mutations. | **Differentiated VIN:** High frequency of **TP53** mutations. | **Classic VIN:** May be discrete, white (hyperkeratotic), or slightly raised and pigmented. | **Classic VIN:** Epidermal thickening, nuclear atypia, increased mitoses, and lack of cellular maturation. Small, immature basaloid cells encompass the full thickness of the epithelium.  **Differentiated VIN:** Marked atypia of the basal layer of the squamous epithelium with normal-appearing differentiation of the more superficial layers. | Lesions may present as white plaques (leukoplakia) or pigmented areas. | - | Two types: 1. **Classic VIN:** HPV-related. 2. **Differentiated VIN:** Not HPV-related. | Progression to invasive squamous cell carcinoma (Basaloid and warty carcinoma from classic VIN; Keratinizing carcinoma from differentiated VIN).  10-30% of patients with classic VIN also have vaginal or cervical HPV-related lesions. | - |
| **Extramammary Paget Disease** A rare intraepithelial proliferation of malignant glandular cells within the vulvar epidermis. | Presumably arise from multipotent cells found within the mammary gland-like ducts of the vulvar skin. | - | Malignant cells proliferate within the epidermis, spreading laterally. It can persist for years without invasion. | - | Presents as a pruritic, red, crusted, maplike area, usually on the labia majora. | Distinctive intraepithelial proliferation of malignant cells (**Paget cells**). These cells are larger than keratinocytes, seen singly or in small clusters. They have pale cytoplasm containing mucopolysaccharide.  **Special Stains:** Positive with periodic acid-Schiff (**PAS**), **Alcian blue**, or **mucicarmine** stains.  **Immunohistochemistry:** Cells express **cytokeratin 7**. | Pruritic (itchy), red, crusted lesion on the labia majora. | - | - | Typically confined to the epidermis and not associated with an underlying cancer (unlike Paget disease of the breast). Invasion is rare, but if it occurs, the prognosis is poor. | Wide local excision. |
| **Vaginal Intraepithelial Neoplasia (VAIN)** A premalignant lesion analogous to cervical SIL, from which vaginal squamous cell carcinoma arises. | Associated with high-risk **HPV infection**. | Greatest risk factor is a previous carcinoma of the cervix or vulva. | Arises from premalignant VAIN. Invasive tumor most often affects the upper vagina. Lower two-thirds lesions metastasize to inguinal nodes; upper vagina lesions spread to regional iliac nodes. | - | - | Analogous to cervical squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL). | - | - | - | Progression to invasive vaginal squamous cell carcinoma. | - |
| **Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) / Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (SIL)** Precursor lesions to cervical carcinoma, caused by HPV infection. | Persistent infection with **high-risk HPV types** (HPV-16, -18, etc.). | Young age at first intercourse, multiple sexual partners, male partner with multiple sexual partners. Immunosuppression. Exposure to co-carcinogens. Host immune status. | 1. HPV infects immature basal epithelial cells, particularly in the **transformation zone**.  2. HPV viral proteins **E6** and **E7** interfere with tumor suppressors **p53** and **RB**, respectively.  3. **E7** binds RB, promoting cell cycle progression and binds/inhibits p21/p27. **E6** binds p53 promoting its degradation and up-regulates telomerase, causing immortalization.  4. **LSIL** is a productive infection with high viral replication but mild host cell changes. Most cases regress.  5. **HSIL** shows progressive cell cycle deregulation, increased proliferation, and is at high risk for progression to carcinoma. | **HPV E6 gene product**: Binds and degrades **p53**. Upregulates **telomerase**.  **HPV E7 gene product**: Binds and degrades active (hypophosphorylated) **RB** protein.  Viral DNA integration into host genome (common in cancer, increases E6/E7 expression) may dysregulate oncogenes like **MYC**. | - | Diagnosis based on **nuclear atypia** (enlargement, hyperchromasia, coarse chromatin) often with cytoplasmic "halos" (perinuclear vacuoles). This change is termed **koilocytic atypia**.  Grading based on expansion of immature cell layer:  **LSIL (CIN I)**: Confined to lower one-third of epithelium.  **HSIL (CIN II/III)**: Expands to upper two-thirds (CIN II) or full thickness (CIN III).  **Special Stains:** Immunohistochemistry for **Ki-67** (proliferation marker) and **p16** (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor) are useful for confirmation. | Usually asymptomatic. Detected via screening. | **Pap test (Papanicolaou smear):** Detects abnormal exfoliated cells.  **HPV DNA testing:** Detects high-risk HPV types.  **Immunohistochemistry:** p16 staining is highly correlated with HPV infection. | **Two-tiered system:** 1. **Low-grade SIL (LSIL)**, corresponds to CIN I. 2. **High-grade SIL (HSIL)**, corresponds to CIN II and CIN III. **Three-tiered CIN system:** 1. **CIN I:** Mild dysplasia 2. **CIN II:** Moderate dysplasia 3. **CIN III:** Severe dysplasia/Carcinoma in situ | Progression to invasive cervical carcinoma. LSIL can progress to HSIL (10% of cases). HSIL can progress to carcinoma (10% of cases). | **LSIL:** Conservative follow-up or local ablation (cryotherapy).  **HSIL:** Treated with cervical conization (superficial excision). |
| **Cervical Carcinoma** Invasive malignant neoplasm of the cervix. | Almost all cases are caused by infection with **high-risk HPV types**. HPV-16 accounts for 60% of cases, HPV-18 for another 10%. | Persistent high-risk HPV infection. (Same as for SIL/CIN). | Slow progression from precursor lesions (SIL) over decades. Advanced carcinoma spreads by direct extension to paracervical tissue, bladder, ureters, rectum, and vagina. Lymphovascular invasion leads to local and distant lymph node metastases.  **Staging:** **Stage 0:** Carcinoma in situ (HSIL/CIN III). **Stage I:** Confined to cervix. **Stage II:** Extends beyond cervix but not to pelvic wall. **Stage III:** Extends to pelvic wall. **Stage IV:** Extends beyond true pelvis or involves bladder/rectum mucosa. | Driven by HPV viral oncogenes **E6** and **E7**. (See CIN/SIL). | May manifest as fungating (exophytic) or infiltrative masses. | **Squamous cell carcinoma:** Nests and tongues of malignant squamous epithelium (keratinizing or nonkeratinizing) invading cervical stroma.  **Adenocarcinoma:** Proliferation of glandular epithelium with malignant endocervical cells (large, hyperchromatic nuclei, mucin-depleted cytoplasm).  **Adenosquamous carcinoma:** Intermixed malignant glandular and squamous epithelium. | Often detected during screening in asymptomatic women. Advanced disease can cause irregular vaginal spotting or bleeding.  Death is often due to local tumor invasion leading to ureteral obstruction, pyelonephritis, and uremia. | **Pap test:** Can detect low-stage, curable cancers.  Biopsy following abnormal colposcopy. | **Histologic Subtypes:** 1. **Squamous cell carcinoma** (80%) 2. **Adenocarcinoma** (15%) 3. **Adenosquamous and neuroendocrine carcinomas** (5%) | Hydronephrosis from ureteral obstruction. Metastasis to liver, lungs, bone marrow. Small-cell neuroendocrine tumors have a very poor prognosis. | **Superficially invasive:** Cervical cone excision.  **Most invasive cancers:** Hysterectomy with lymph node dissection.  **Advanced lesions:** Radiation and chemotherapy. |
| **Endometriosis** Presence of ectopic endometrial tissue (glands and stroma) at a site outside of the uterus. | Exact cause is elusive. Principally a disease of women in active reproductive life (third and fourth decades). | - (Retrograde menstruation is a common occurrence, up to 90% of women, but endometriosis is less common, suggesting other factors are required). | Theories of origin:  1. **Regurgitation theory:** Retrograde menstrual flow implants endometrial tissue.  2. **Benign metastasis theory:** Spread via blood/lymphatics.  3. **Metaplastic theory:** Arises from coelomic epithelium.  4. **Extrauterine stem/progenitor cell theory:** Bone marrow stem cells differentiate into endometrial tissue. Ectopic tissue shows increased inflammatory factors (**PGE2, ILs, TNFα**), increased local estrogen production via **aromatase**, and epigenetic changes increasing estrogen responsiveness. | Mutations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, such as **KRAS, PIK3CA, PPP2R1A, and ARID1A**, have been identified in the epithelial cells of deeply infiltrating endometriosis. Can harbor the same mutations as associated carcinomas, suggesting a pathogenic role for these driver mutations. | Nodules with a **red-blue to yellow-brown** appearance on serosal surfaces. Organizing hemorrhage can cause extensive fibrous adhesions.  In ovaries, can form large (3-5 cm) cystic masses called **chocolate cysts** or **endometriomas**, filled with brown fluid. | Histologic diagnosis is made by identifying both **endometrial glands and stroma**, with or without hemosiderin-laden macrophages. Long-standing lesions may be obscured by fibrosis.  **Atypical endometriosis** is a precursor to carcinoma and shows cytologic atypia or glandular crowding. | Severe dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation), dyspareunia (painful intercourse), pelvic pain. Menstrual irregularities.  Infertility is the presenting complaint in 30% to 40% of women. | - | **Three types:** Superficial peritoneal endometriosis, ovarian endometriosis, and deep infiltrating endometriosis. **Common sites (descending order):** Ovaries, uterine ligaments, rectovaginal septum, cul de sac, pelvic peritoneum, serosa of bowel, appendix, laparotomy scars. | Infertility, pelvic pain. Risk of developing malignancy (**endometrioid and clear cell ovarian carcinoma**) within endometriomas. Can coexist with **adenomyosis**. | Inhibitors of **aromatase** are beneficial in treatment. |
| **Adenomyosis** Presence of endometrial tissue (glands and stroma) within the uterine wall (myometrium). | Down-growth of endometrial tissue into and between the smooth muscle fascicles of the myometrium. Occurs in up to 20% of uteri. | - | Endometrial tissue, which remains in continuity with the endometrium, grows down into the myometrium. | - | - (The text does not specify gross features, but implies uterine enlargement). | Irregular nests of endometrial stroma, with or without glands, are arranged within the myometrium. | Menometrorrhagia (irregular and heavy menses), colicky dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and pelvic pain, particularly during the premenstrual period. | - | - | Can coexist with endometriosis. | - |
| **Endometrial Hyperplasia** An abnormal proliferation of endometrial glands relative to the stroma, resulting in an increased gland-to-stroma ratio. | Caused by prolonged or marked excess of estrogen relative to progestin (**unopposed estrogen stimulation**). | Obesity (peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogen), menopause, polycystic ovarian syndrome, functioning granulosa cell tumors of the ovary, excessive ovarian cortical function, prolonged administration of exogenous estrogen. | Unopposed estrogen stimulation leads to proliferation of endometrial glands. Loss of the tumor suppressor gene **PTEN** is an early and common event. Loss of PTEN function may stimulate estrogen-dependent gene expression, leading to overgrowth. | Inactivation of the **PTEN** tumor suppressor gene is a common genetic alteration. Mutations are found in >20% of hyperplasias (with and without atypia). PTEN loss leads to overactive PI3K/AKT pathway signaling. Patients with **Cowden syndrome** (germline PTEN mutations) have a high incidence of endometrial carcinoma. | - | **Typical Hyperplasia:** Increased gland-to-stroma ratio. Glands show variation in size and shape, may be dilated (cystic). May have back-to-back glands focally but stroma is retained.  **Atypical Hyperplasia (Endometrial Intraepithelial Neoplasia):** Complex patterns of proliferating glands with nuclear atypia. Glands are commonly back-to-back with complex outlines. Cells are rounded with vesicular chromatin and conspicuous nucleoli. | An important cause of abnormal uterine bleeding. | - | **WHO Classification:** 1. **Hyperplasia** (without atypia). 2. **Atypical hyperplasia** (also called Endometrial Intraepithelial Neoplasia). | Frequent precursor to the most common type of endometrial carcinoma (Endometrioid type). Typical hyperplasia rarely progresses to carcinoma (1-3%). Atypical hyperplasia has a high risk of coexisting or subsequent carcinoma (up to 50% of cases). | **Atypical hyperplasia:** Hysterectomy. In young women desiring fertility, a trial of progestin therapy and close follow-up. |
| **Carcinoma of the Endometrium** The most common invasive cancer of the female genital tract. | **Type I:** Associated with unopposed estrogen stimulation.  **Type II:** Arises in the setting of endometrial atrophy. | **Type I (Endometrioid):** Obesity, hypertension, diabetes, unopposed estrogen.  **Type II (Serous):** Occurs in thin, older women, often associated with endometrial atrophy. Women of African-American descent have it more frequently. | **Type I (Endometrioid):** Arises from precursor lesion of endometrial hyperplasia, with stepwise acquisition of genetic mutations.  **Type II (Serous):** Arises from a precursor called serous endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma. Spreads early via exfoliation and transtubal routes.  **Staging:** **Stage I:** Confined to corpus uteri.  **Stage II:** Involves corpus and cervix.  **Stage III:** Extends outside uterus but not true pelvis.  **Stage IV:** Extends outside true pelvis or involves bladder/rectum. | Four molecular subtypes exist:  1. **Ultramutated/POLE:** Mutations in DNA polymerase ε (**POLE**), very high mutation burden.  2. **Hypermutated/MSI:** Mutations/silencing of mismatch repair genes.  3. **Copy number low/MSS:** Associated with endometrioid type, mutations upregulating PI3K/AKT pathway.  4. **Copy number high/Serous-like:** Aggressive tumors, often with **TP53** mutations and numerous genomic copy number variants. | Can be a localized polypoid mass or diffusely involve the endometrial lining. Serous carcinomas often arise in small, atrophic uteri and can be large, bulky tumors. | - | Uncommon in women <40. Peak incidence 55-65 years. Usually produces irregular or postmenopausal vaginal bleeding, which often leads to early detection. Serous carcinoma has a worse prognosis due to its aggressive nature. | Diagnosed by histologic examination of tissue from biopsy or curettage. Endometrioid carcinomas are analyzed for DNA mismatch repair defects (to screen for **Lynch syndrome**). | **Two broad categories:**  1. **Type I (Endometrioid):** 80-85% of cases. Lower grade, indolent, associated with estrogen/hyperplasia.  2. **Type II (Serous):** 15% of cases. Higher grade, aggressive, associated with atrophy. | Type I is associated with endometrial hyperplasia. 3-5% of women with endometrial cancer have **Lynch syndrome** and are at high risk for colon carcinoma. Serous carcinoma has a propensity for extrauterine (lymphatic or transtubal) spread. | **Endometrioid:** Adjuvant radiation, chemotherapy if spread.  **Serous:** Chemotherapy.  **Targeted therapy:** Inhibitors of PI3K/AKT pathway and immune checkpoint inhibitors (for MSI tumors) are being tested. |
| **Endometrioid Endometrial Carcinoma** The most common type of endometrial carcinoma (Type I), mimicking proliferative endometrial glands. | Arises in the setting of endometrial hyperplasia and unopposed estrogenic stimulation. | Obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes. | Stems from the stepwise acquisition of genetic alterations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, starting with atypical hyperplasia. Most common mutations act to increase signaling through the **PI3K/AKT pathway**. | **Mutations increasing PI3K/AKT signaling:**  **PTEN** (suppressor gene): 30-80% of tumors.  **PIK3CA** (oncogene): ~40% of tumors.  **KRAS** (oncogene): ~25% of tumors.  **ARID1A** (chromatin regulator): ~33% of tumors.  **DNA Mismatch Repair gene defects:** ~20% of sporadic tumors (often via MLH1 promoter hypermethylation).  **POLE** mutations: <10%.  **TP53** mutations: late event in ~50% of poorly differentiated tumors. | Can be a localized polypoid mass or diffusely involve the endometrial lining. Spreads via myometrial invasion. | Demonstrates glandular growth patterns.  **Grade 1 (Well differentiated):** Almost entirely well-formed glands.  **Grade 2 (Moderately differentiated):** Glands mixed with solid sheets of cells (≤50% of tumor).  **Grade 3 (Poorly differentiated):** >50% solid growth pattern.  Up to 20% contain foci of squamous differentiation. | Presents with postmenopausal or irregular bleeding. Most (80%) are stage I, well or moderately differentiated at diagnosis. | - | Histologic grades 1, 2, and 3 based on percentage of solid growth pattern. | Preceded by atypical hyperplasia. Associated with Lynch syndrome. Infiltrating T-cells are common in tumors with mismatch repair defects or POLE mutations. | Surgery +/- radiation. Chemotherapy for spread beyond the uterus. |
| **Adenosarcoma** A tumor of endometrial stroma admixed with benign glands. | Uncommon tumor, less than 5% of endometrial cancers. Predominates in women in their fourth and fifth decades. | - | Malignant-appearing stroma coexists with benign but abnormally shaped endometrial glands. | - | Large, broad-based endometrial polypoid growths that may prolapse through the cervical os. | Malignant-appearing stroma with benign, abnormally shaped endometrial glands. | Presents as a large endometrial polyp. | - | - | Considered a low-grade malignancy. Recurrences develop in one-fourth of cases, nearly always confined to the pelvis. Must be distinguished from large benign polyps. | - |
| **Stromal Tumors** Neoplasms of the endometrium that resemble normal stromal cells. | Associated with specific, recurrent chromosomal translocations that create fusion genes. | - | Pathogenesis involves creation of fusion proteins that disrupt normal gene regulation, leading to misexpression of oncogenic genes. | **Low-grade stromal sarcoma:** Usually a translocation fusing a portion of the **JAZF1** gene (transcriptional repressor) with a polycomb family gene, such as **SUZ12**.  **High-grade stromal sarcoma:** Contains different chromosomal translocations that also result in fusion genes. | - | - | - | - | 1. **Benign stromal nodules**  2. **Endometrial stromal sarcoma**, which is further divided into:   - Low-grade   - High-grade | About half of stromal sarcomas recur. Relapse rates range from 36% to >80%. Distant metastases may occur decades after initial diagnosis. | - |
| **Leiomyoma (Fibroid)** Benign smooth muscle neoplasms of the myometrium; the most common tumor in women. | Arise from myometrial smooth muscle cells. Several cytogenetic and molecular subgroups exist. | - | Mutations in genes like **MED12** are thought to be causative, contributing to tumor development. Hormonal influences (estrogen, progesterone) likely play a role in growth. | Approximately 40% have a simple chromosomal abnormality.  Rearrangements of chromosomes 12q14 and 6p involving **HMGIC** and **HMGIY** genes (regulate chromatin structure).  Mutations in the **MED12** gene occur in roughly 70% of uterine leiomyomas. MED12 encodes a component of the Mediator complex which stimulates gene expression. | Sharply circumscribed, discrete, round, firm, **gray-white tumors**. Cut section shows a characteristic **whorled pattern** of smooth muscle bundles. Can be intramural, submucosal, or subserosal. Large tumors may have areas of yellow-brown to red softening (infarction). | Composed of bundles of smooth muscle cells that resemble uninvolved myometrium. Cells are uniform in size and shape with oval nuclei and long, slender cytoplasm. Mitotic figures are scarce. Variants include leiomyoma with bizarre nuclei and cellular leiomyoma, both benign. | Often asymptomatic. Can cause abnormal bleeding, urinary frequency, sudden pain from infarction, and impaired fertility. | - | **Location:** Intramural, submucosal, subserosal.  **Rare Variants:**   - **Intravenous leiomyomatosis:** extends into vessels.   - **Disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis:** multiple small peritoneal nodules. | **Pregnancy complications:** spontaneous abortion, fetal malpresentation, uterine inertia, postpartum hemorrhage. Malignant transformation to leiomyosarcoma is extremely rare. | - |
| **Leiomyosarcoma** An uncommon, malignant smooth muscle tumor of the uterus, typically arising de novo. | Thought to arise from myometrium or endometrial stromal precursor cells, not from preexisting leiomyomas. | - | Genetic abnormalities are complex and distinct from leiomyomas. They recur following surgery and metastasize hematogenously. | Have complex, highly variable karyotypes, frequently with deletions. A subset contains **MED12** mutations. | Bulky, fleshy masses that invade the uterine wall, or polypoid masses projecting into the uterine lumen. Often show hemorrhage and necrosis. | Wide range of cytologic atypia. Distinction from leiomyoma is based on:  1. **Nuclear atypia** 2. **Mitotic index** (≥10 mitoses per 10 high-power fields indicates malignancy)  3. **Tumor necrosis**  A proportion are called "smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential." | Occurs before and after menopause (peak incidence 40-60 years). Presents with uterine bleeding, pain, or a palpable mass. | - | - | High rate of recurrence and hematogenous metastasis to distant organs like lungs, bone, and brain. Overall 5-year survival is ~40%, but only 10-15% for anaplastic lesions. | - |
| **Follicle and Luteal Cysts** Common functional cysts of the ovary originating from Graafian follicles or corpora lutea. | **Follicle cysts:** Originate from unruptured Graafian follicles or follicles that have ruptured and immediately sealed.  **Luteal cysts:** Normal corpora lutea that become cystic. | - | - | - | **Follicle cysts:** Usually multiple, up to 2 cm, filled with clear serous fluid, lined by a gray, glistening membrane.  **Luteal cysts:** Lined by a rim of bright yellow tissue. Prone to hemorrhage and rupture. | **Follicle cysts:** Lined by granulosa cells, with outer theca cells that may be prominent (luteinized).  **Luteal cysts:** Lined by luteinized granulosa cells. | Usually asymptomatic. Larger follicle cysts (>2cm) may cause pelvic pain. Rupture of a luteal cyst may produce a peritoneal reaction due to bleeding. | - | - | Rupture of luteal cyst can cause peritoneal irritation. Luteinization of theca cells (hyperthecosis) can be associated with increased estrogen production and endometrial abnormalities. | - |
| **Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) and Stromal Hyperthecosis** A complex endocrine disorder with hyperandrogenism, menstrual abnormalities, polycystic ovaries, chronic anovulation, and decreased fertility. | Etiology is incompletely understood. Formerly called **Stein-Leventhal syndrome**. Marked by dysregulation of enzymes in androgen biosynthesis and excessive androgen production. | - | Excessive androgen production is a central feature. Patients show insulin resistance and altered adipose tissue metabolism. Chronic anovulation leads to unopposed estrogen (via peripheral conversion of androgens), increasing risk for endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. | - | Ovaries are enlarged with numerous cystic follicles or follicle cysts. **Stromal hyperthecosis** shows uniform, usually bilateral, ovarian enlargement (up to 7 cm) with a white to tan appearance. | **PCOS:** Numerous cystic follicles.  **Stromal Hyperthecosis:** Hypercellular stroma and luteinization of stromal cells, visible as discrete nests of cells with vacuolated cytoplasm. | Hyperandrogenism (hirsutism), menstrual abnormalities, anovulation, infertility. In **stromal hyperthecosis**, virilization may be more striking. | - | - | Obesity, type 2 diabetes, premature atherosclerosis. Increased risk for **endometrial hyperplasia** and **carcinoma** due to increased free serum estrone levels. | - |
| **Ovarian Epithelial Tumors** Neoplasms arising from the müllerian epithelium covering the ovary or from tubal epithelium. They are the most common type of primary ovarian neoplasm. | Believed to arise ultimately from one of three components: surface/fallopian tube epithelium, germ cells, or sex cord-stromal cells. Most arise from müllerian epithelium. | **Malignant (Serous):** Nulliparity, family history, heritable mutations (BRCA1, BRCA2).  **Protective factors:** Oral contraceptives, tubal ligation. | Classified based on differentiation and proliferation.  **Type I carcinomas (low-grade):** Progress from benign tumors through borderline tumors (e.g., low-grade serous, endometrioid, mucinous).  **Type II carcinomas (high-grade):** Arise from serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) in fallopian tube fimbriae or from serous inclusion cysts within the ovary. | **BRCA1** and **BRCA2** germline mutations increase susceptibility to ovarian cancer. | Can be cystic (cystadenoma), cystic and fibrous (cystadenofibroma), or fibrous (adenofibroma). Can be small or grow to fill the pelvis. | Classification is based on the differentiation of the neoplastic epithelium. | Often asymptomatic until large. Common symptoms: abdominal pain and distention, urinary and GI symptoms from compression, vaginal bleeding. Malignant tumors cause progressive weakness, weight loss, cachexia, and ascites. | **CA-125** is a serum marker used to monitor disease recurrence/progression, but lacks sensitivity and specificity for screening. | Classified as **Benign**, **Borderline**, or **Malignant**.  **Major histologic types:** Serous, mucinous, and endometrioid tumors. | Malignant tumors spread to peritoneal surfaces and omentum, often causing ascites. Can metastasize to regional nodes, liver, lungs, GI tract. | - |
| **Serous Tumors (Ovarian)** Cystic neoplasms with tubal-like epithelium. The most common type of malignant ovarian tumor. | **Low-grade:** Arise in association with serous borderline tumors.  **High-grade:** Arise from in situ lesions in fallopian tube fimbriae (**STIC**) or serous inclusion cysts in the ovary. Often associated with BRCA mutations. | Nulliparity, family history, **BRCA1/BRCA2** mutations. | **Low-grade pathway:** Stepwise progression from borderline tumor to low-grade carcinoma.  **High-grade pathway:** Arises de novo from STIC or inclusion cysts. High-grade tumors have a propensity to spread to peritoneal surfaces and omentum, commonly associated with ascites. | **Low-grade:** Mutations in **KRAS, BRAF, or ERBB2** oncogenes. Usually wild-type TP53.  **High-grade:** High frequency of **TP53** mutations. Lack KRAS/BRAF mutations. Common genomic imbalances (amplification of **PIK3CA**, deletion of **RB**). Almost all arising in BRCA1/2 carriers are high-grade with TP53 mutations. | May be a multicystic lesion or a mass projecting from the ovarian surface. **Benign:** Smooth cyst wall. **Borderline:** Increased papillary projections. **Malignant:** Larger areas of solid/papillary growth, irregularity, fixation. Bilaterality is common (20% benign, 30% borderline, 66% malignant). | Cysts are lined by ciliated columnar epithelium.  **Benign:** Simple structure.  **Borderline:** Increased complexity of stromal papillae, stratification of epithelium, mild nuclear atypia, NO stromal invasion.  **Low-grade carcinoma:** Often has a delicate **micropapillary** pattern.  **High-grade carcinoma:** Complex growth patterns, widespread infiltration, marked nuclear atypia.  **Psammoma bodies** (concentric calcifications) are common but not specific. | Benign/borderline tumors are most common between 20-45 years. Malignant tumors occur later. Often present with advanced disease and widespread peritoneal metastases. | - | Classified as Benign, Borderline, and Malignant.  Malignant is divided into **Low-grade** and **High-grade** serous carcinoma. | Spread to peritoneal surfaces (noninvasive implants in borderline; invasive in carcinoma). Ascites. High-grade tumors are aggressive and often widely metastatic at diagnosis. | Women at high risk (BRCA carriers) may undergo risk-reducing **salpingo-oophorectomy**. |
| **Mucinous Tumors (Ovarian)** Ovarian tumors composed of mucin-producing epithelial cells. They account for 20-25% of all ovarian neoplasms. | Development is initiated by KRAS mutations, which are found in all stages from benign to malignant. | - | KRAS mutations appear to initiate development. Progression may occur from benign to borderline to carcinoma. | Mutation of the **KRAS** proto-oncogene is a consistent genetic alteration, found in the majority of benign cystadenomas (58%), borderline tumors (75-86%), and carcinomas (85%). | Tend to produce very large cystic masses (can exceed 25kg). They are multiloculated and filled with sticky, gelatinous fluid. The surface of the ovary is rarely involved. Only 5% are bilateral. | **Benign:** Lined by tall, columnar epithelial cells with apical mucin, lacking cilia. Most show gastric or intestinal type differentiation.  **Borderline:** Show epithelial stratification, tufting, and/or papillary growth, resembling tubular or villous adenomas.  **Carcinoma:** Demonstrates confluent glandular growth (**expansile invasion**). | Occur principally in middle adult life. The vast majority are benign or borderline. Primary ovarian mucinous carcinomas are uncommon. | - | Classified as Benign, Borderline, and Malignant. Malignant tumors can be classified as "intraepithelial carcinoma" (non-invasive) or frankly invasive. | **Pseudomyxoma peritonei:** Mucinous ascites and cystic epithelial implants on peritoneal surfaces. This condition is now known to almost always originate from an appendiceal tumor, not a primary ovarian tumor. Bilateral mucinous tumors require exclusion of metastasis. | - |
| **Endometrioid Ovarian Tumors** Ovarian tumors with tubular glands resembling endometrium. Account for 10-15% of all ovarian cancers. | In 15-20% of cases, they coexist with and are thought to arise from **ovarian endometriosis**. Can also arise from metastatic spread of a primary endometrial tumor. | Endometriosis. | Endometriosis serves as a precursor in some cases. Share molecular features with endometrial carcinoma of the uterus, including frequent alterations that increase PI3K/AKT pathway signaling. | Shared features with uterine endometrioid carcinoma:  - Frequent alterations increasing **PI3K/AKT** pathway signaling (mutations in **PTEN, PIK3CA, ARID1A, KRAS**).  - Mutations in mismatch DNA repair genes.  - **TP53** mutations are common in poorly differentiated tumors. | Typically present with solid and cystic areas of growth. 40% are bilateral. | Distinguished by the presence of tubular glands resembling benign or malignant endometrium. Benign and borderline forms are uncommon. | Peak incidence of endometriosis-associated tumors is a decade earlier than non-associated tumors. | - | Classified as Benign (endometrioid adenofibroma), Borderline, and Malignant (endometrioid carcinoma). | Associated with endometriosis (15-20%). Can be associated with a concomitant primary carcinoma of the endometrium (15-30% of cases). | - |
| **Clear Cell Carcinoma (Ovarian)** Uncommon ovarian carcinoma composed of large epithelial cells with abundant clear cytoplasm, thought to be a variant of endometrioid adenocarcinoma. | Sometimes occur in association with endometriosis or endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary. | Endometriosis. | Considered a variant of endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Portends a poor outcome in advanced stage disease. | Genetic aberrations (**PIK3CA, ARID1A, KRAS, PTEN, TP53**) are shared with endometrioid carcinoma, albeit at different frequencies. | Can be predominantly solid or cystic. | Composed of large epithelial cells with abundant clear cytoplasm, resembling hypersecretory gestational endometrium. In solid forms, cells are in sheets/tubules. In cystic forms, they line spaces. | - | - | Benign and borderline clear cell tumors are exceedingly rare. | Association with endometriosis or endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary. | Treated like other types of ovarian carcinoma. |
| **Cystadenofibroma** An uncommon variant of ovarian epithelial tumor with pronounced proliferation of fibrous stroma underlying the columnar epithelium. | - | - | - | - | Usually small and multilocular. | Pronounced proliferation of fibrous stroma that underlies the columnar lining epithelium. Have simple papillary processes. The epithelium can be mucinous, serous, endometrioid, or transitional (Brenner tumor) type. | - | - | Benign lesions are most common. Borderline lesions with cellular atypia and, rarely, tumors with focal areas of carcinoma can occur. | Metastatic spread from borderline or malignant forms is extremely uncommon. | - |
