# [[PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IN OBSTETRICS, PAEDIATRICS AND GERIATRICS]] > In a block of west Bengal, recent statistics showed a lower rate of institutional delivery. As a health administrator of that block, what measures you like to adopt for improving institutional delivery in your block.

As a Health Administrator (Block Medical Officer of Health - BMOH), increasing the rate of [[Institutional Delivery]] requires a multipronged strategy focusing on infrastructure strengthening, effective implementation of government schemes, and community mobilization.

The following measures will be adopted to improve institutional delivery in the block:

### 1. Situation Analysis and Micro-planning
*   **Gap Analysis:** Conduct a rapid assessment to identify specific reasons for low institutional delivery (e.g., lack of transport, poor staff behavior, cost, or cultural beliefs).
*   **Mapping:** Identify "left-out" and "drop-out" villages/hamlets with the lowest delivery rates and map them against the nearest functional health facility.
*   **Tracking:** Utilize the **[[Mother and Child Tracking System]] (MCTS)** / RCH portal to ensure every registered pregnant woman is tracked till delivery.

### 2. Strengthening Infrastructure (Supply Side)
*   **Operationalizing 24x7 PHCs:** Ensure that at least 50% of the [[Primary Health Centres]] (PHCs) in the block are functional 24x7 to conduct round-the-clock deliveries.
*   **First Referral Units (FRUs):** Operationalize Community Health Centres (CHCs) as FRUs with facilities for **[[Caesarean Section]]**, blood storage, and newborn care to handle complications.
*   **Labour Room Quality:** Implement **[[LaQshya]]** (Labour Room Quality Improvement Initiative) guidelines to ensure respectful maternity care, privacy, and sterile conditions, reducing the fear of hospitals.
*   **Newborn Care:** Establish functional **[[Newborn Care Corners]] (NBCC)** in all delivery points to manage immediate neonatal resuscitation.

### 3. Effective Implementation of Schemes (Financial & Logistical Support)
*   **[[Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram]] (JSSK):** Strictly enforce the policy of **zero out-of-pocket expenses**.
    *   **Free Transport:** Ensure availability of free referral transport (102 Ambulances) from home to facility, facility to facility (if referred), and drop back home.
    *   **Free Diet & Drugs:** Ensure stock of essential drugs and provision of free diet for 3 days (normal delivery) or 7 days (C-section).
*   **[[Janani Suraksha Yojana]] (JSY):**
    *   Ensure timely disbursement of cash incentives to mothers and ASHAs to build trust in the system.
    *   Incentivize **[[ASHA]]** workers immediately after the institutional delivery is confirmed.
*   **[[Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan]] (PMSMA):** Organize fixed-day antenatal clinics on the 9th of every month to identify **[[High Risk Pregnancies]]** (HRPs) and birth-plan them for institutional delivery at higher centers.

### 4. Manpower Management and Training
*   **Skilled Birth Attendants (SBA):** Ensure all ANMs and Staff Nurses are trained in SBA protocols and Dakshata guidelines to manage normal deliveries proficiently.
*   **Incentives:** Ensure prompt payment of delivery honorarium to staff for conducting deliveries at night/odd hours to keep motivation high.
*   **Hiring Specialists:** If specialists (Gynecologists/Anesthetists) are unavailable at the CHC, hire private specialists on a contract/visit basis for emergency obstetric care.

### 5. Community Mobilization and IEC (Demand Side)
*   **Role of ASHA & Anganwadi Workers:**
    *   Instruct ASHAs to act as "Escorts" accompanying the pregnant woman to the facility.
    *   Promote **[[Birth Preparedness and Complication Readiness]] (BPCR)** plans for every pregnant woman during ANC visits.
*   **Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Days (VHSND):** Use these platforms to educate families (specifically mothers-in-law and husbands) about the dangers of home delivery and the benefits of hospital delivery.
*   **Feedback Mechanism:** Organize "Maternal Death Reviews" (MDR) and community audits to understand causes of any home-based maternal death and prevent recurrence.

### 6. Public-Private Partnership (PPP)
*   **Vandemataram Scheme:** Involve private obstetricians/clinics to provide free ANC and delivery services if government facilities are overwhelmed or inaccessible in certain pockets.

### Mnemonic for Strategy: **"SPEED"**
*   **S** - **S**trengthen 24x7 PHCs and FRUs
*   **P** - **P**rompt JSY/ASHA payments
*   **E** - **E**nsure Free Transport (JSSK)
*   **E** - **E**ducate community (IEC/BCC)
*   **D** - **D**etect High Risk Pregnancies (PMSMA)
