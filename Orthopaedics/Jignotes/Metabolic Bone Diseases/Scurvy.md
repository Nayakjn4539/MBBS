# Scurvy (Barlow's Disease)

### Etiopathogenesis
Scurvy is a metabolic bone disease caused by a deficiency of **Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)**. It is characterized by a defect in the formation of the intercellular substance (osteoid), specifically affecting **[[Collagen]] maturation**,.

*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   Vitamin C is essential for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine, which are critical for collagen synthesis.
    *   In scurvy, **[[Mineralization]]** is normal (calcium deposits in cartilage), but **[[Osteoid]]** formation is defective.
    *   Chondrocytes proliferate and calcify, but osteoblasts fail to lay down new osteoid on the calcified cartilage matrix.
    *   Capillary fragility leads to hemorrhage (subperiosteal and systemic) due to defective vascular wall collagen.

### Clinical Features
The condition typically manifests in infants (6–24 months) or elderly individuals with poor diet.

*   **General Symptoms:** Irritability, anorexia, failure to thrive, and low-grade fever.
*   **Musculoskeletal:**
    *   **Pseudoparalysis:** The child refuses to move the limb due to severe pain caused by subperiosteal hemorrhage,.
    *   **Frog-leg Position:** The hips are kept flexed and abducted for comfort.
    *   **Tenderness:** Excessive tenderness over the bones, particularly the knees and ankles.
*   **Cutaneous/Mucosal:**
    *   **Spongy Gums:** Swollen, bleeding gums (only if teeth have erupted).
    *   **Hemorrhages:** Petechiae, ecchymosis, and easy bruising.
*   **Chest:**
    *   **Scorbutic Rosary:** Prominence of the costochondral junctions. Unlike the rachitic rosary (which is rounded/blunt), the scorbutic rosary is **sharp and angular** due to subluxation of the sternal plate,.

### Radiological Features
X-rays are diagnostic and show characteristic changes, particularly at the ends of long bones (e.g., knee, wrist).

> Radiograph of knee showing classical signs of scurvy: White line of Frankel, Trummerfeld zone, Pelkan's spur, and Wimberger's ring sign

| Sign | Description | Pathophysiology |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ground Glass Appearance** | Generalized [[Osteoporosis]] with loss of trabecular pattern,. | Atrophy of marrow and trabeculae. |
| **Pencil-Thin Cortex** | The cortex becomes extremely thin and distinct. | Defective osteoid formation. |
| **White Line of Frankel** | A dense, white line at the metaphysis. | Zone of provisional calcification persists and thickens because it is not converted into bone. |
| **Trummerfeld Zone** | A radiolucent (dark) band located immediately proximal to the White line of Frankel (Scorbutic zone). | Represents debris and fractures of the primary spongiosa (weak area). |
| **Pelkan's Spur** | A bony spur projecting from the lateral border of the metaphysis. | Caused by compression fracture or mushrooming of the metaphysis. |
| **Wimberger's Ring Sign** | A dense sclerotic rim surrounding the [[Epiphysis]] with a lucent center,. | The dense zone of provisional calcification surrounds the epiphysis, while the center remains osteoporotic. |
| **Subperiosteal Hemorrhage** | Large soft tissue shadows that may calcify/ossify during healing. | Bleeding lifts the periosteum; visible only when healing calcification occurs (dumb-bell shape). |

#### Wimberger’s Ring Sign (Detail)
*   **Definition:** It is a circular, dense radiological shadow seen surrounding the epiphyseal center of ossification.
*   **Appearance:** The epiphysis appears as a ring with a dense white border and a central radiolucency.
*   **Mechanism:** Similar to the metaphysis, the zone of provisional calcification around the ossification center persists (white rim), while the internal cancellous bone becomes porotic (lucent center).
*   **Differentiation:** Wimberger's *sign* (Scurvy) should not be confused with Wimberger's *corner sign* (Congenital Syphilis), which is medial tibial erosion.

### Differential Diagnosis

*   **[[Acute Osteomyelitis]]:** Scurvy mimics osteomyelitis due to pseudoparalysis, fever, and tenderness. However, in scurvy, the swelling is often bilateral, not hot, and systemic toxicity is less severe.
*   **[[Rickets]]:** Differentiated by the type of rosary (angular in scurvy vs. rounded in rickets) and radiological features (cupping/splaying in rickets vs. white line/ring sign in scurvy),.
*   **[[Leukemia]]:** Can present with bone pain and radiolucent metaphysical bands.
*   **Battered Baby Syndrome:** Multiple fractures and bruises.

### Treatment
*   **Medical Management:** Administration of **[[Vitamin C]]** (Ascorbic Acid).
    *   Oral or parenteral supplementation leads to rapid resolution of pain and constitutional symptoms.
    *   Spontaneous correction of deformities usually occurs with growth.
*   **Surgical Management:** Rarely needed. Subperiosteal hematomas resolve, and fractures generally heal with conservative care.

### Mnemonic for Radiological Signs: **"S-C-U-R-V-Y"**
*   **S** - **S**pur (Pelkan's)
*   **C** - **C**ortex thinning (Pencil-thin)
*   **U** - **U**nder-mineralization (Ground glass osteoporosis)
*   **R** - **R**ing sign (**Wimberger's**)
*   **V** - **V**itamin C deficiency causes **W**hite line of Frankel
*   **Y** - **Y**ikes! (Painful subperiosteal hemorrhage/Trummerfeld zone)
