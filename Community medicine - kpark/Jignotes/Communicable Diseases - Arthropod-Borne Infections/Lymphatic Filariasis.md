# [[Communicable Diseases - Arthropod-Borne Infections]] > Lymphatic Filariasis

### Lymphatic Filariasis

**Lymphatic Filariasis** (LF), commonly known as **Elephantiasis**, is a vector-borne parasitic disease causing significant disability and social stigma. It is a major public health problem in India, targeting the lymphatic system.

---

### 1. Epidemiological Determinants

#### A. Agent Factors
*   **Causative Agents:** Caused by nematode worms.
    1.  **[[Wuchereria bancrofti]]:** Responsible for **99.4%** of cases in India.
    2.  **[[Brugia malayi]]:** Restricted distribution (Kerala, Odisha).
    3.  **[[Brugia timori]]:** Not found in India.
*   **Life Cycle forms:**
    *   **Adult worms (Macrofilaria):** Live in lymphatic vessels/nodes. Life span ~15 years.
    *   **Embryos (Microfilaria - Mf):** Released by female worms into the blood. Life span ~1 year.
*   **Periodicity:** Indian strains show **Nocturnal Periodicity** (Mf appear in peripheral blood at night, typically 10 PM – 2 AM) to match the biting habits of the vector.

#### B. Host Factors
*   **Natural Host:** [[Man]] is the only definitive host (Reservoir).
*   **Intermediate Host:** Mosquito.
*   **Age/Sex:** Affects all ages and sexes; incidence increases with age.
*   **Immunity:** Infection does not confer solid immunity.

#### C. Environmental/Vector Factors
*   **Vectors:**
    *   **Bancroftian Filariasis:** Transmitted by **[[Culex quinquefasciatus]]** (Breeds in dirty, polluted water/sewage; ubiquitous in urban/rural areas).
    *   **Brugian Filariasis:** Transmitted by **[[Mansonia]]** species (*M. annulifera, M. uniformis*). (Breeds in water with aquatic plants like *Pistia*).
*   **Climate:** Favored by high humidity and moderate temperatures.

> **Mnemonic for Vectors:**
> *   **C**ulex = **C**ity water (Dirty/Sewage) -> Causes Bancroftian.
> *   **M**ansonia = **M**arine plants (*Pistia*) -> Causes Brugian.

### 2. Transmission
*   **Mode:** Bite of infected female mosquito.
*   **Mechanism:** It is not a direct injection. The mosquito deposits **L3 infective larvae** on the skin, which enter the body through the puncture wound.
*   **Biological Transmission Type:** **[[Cyclo-developmental]]** (The parasite changes form/developmental stage in the vector but does not multiply).

---

### 3. Incubation Periods
*   **Pre-patent Period:** Time from infection to appearance of Microfilaria (Mf) in blood (approx. 10–12 months).
*   **Clinical Incubation Period:** Time from infection to clinical manifestations (approx. 8–16 months).

---

### 4. Clinical Spectrum
The disease manifests in four stages:

1.  **Asymptomatic Amicrofilaremia:** No symptoms, Mf not detectable (occult).
2.  **Asymptomatic Microfilaremia:** No symptoms but Mf present in blood. Potent source of infection.
3.  **Acute Manifestations:**
    *   **Filarial Fever:** High fever with chills.
    *   **Lymphangitis/Lymphadenitis:** Inflammation of vessels/nodes (Retrograde lymphangitis is characteristic).
    *   **[[ADLA]] (Acute Dermato-Lymphangio-Adenitis):** Painful swelling of limbs due to secondary bacterial infection.
    *   **Epididymo-orchitis:** Inflammation of testes/epididymis.
4.  **Chronic Manifestations:**
    *   **Lymphoedema/Elephantiasis:** Permanent swelling of legs, arms, scrotum, vulva, breast.
    *   **Hydrocele:** Accumulation of fluid in the scrotum (Common in *W. bancrofti*).
    *   **Chyluria:** Milky white urine due to rupture of lymphatics into the urinary tract.

**Occult Filariasis:** A hypersensitivity reaction to microfilariae causing **[[Tropical Pulmonary Eosinophilia]] (TPE)**. Features: Nocturnal cough, wheezing, high eosinophil count. Mf are absent in blood.

### 5. Diagnosis
1.  **Microscopy:** **[[Night Blood Survey]]** (NBS). Thick blood smear collected between **8:30 PM and 12:00 Midnight**.
2.  **DEC Provocation Test:** Giving a low dose of DEC during the day induces Mf to enter peripheral blood (useful for day surveys).
3.  **Antigen Detection:** Immunochromatographic Card Test (ICT). Can be done anytime (day/night). Detects adult worm antigen.
4.  **Xenodiagnosis:** Feeding mosquitoes on patient and dissecting them later (Research only).

### 6. Treatment and Management
*   **Chemotherapy:**
    *   **[[Diethylcarbamazine]] (DEC):** Drug of choice. Microfilaricidal (kills Mf).
    *   **Dose:** 6 mg/kg body weight for 12 days.
    *   **Ivermectin:** Used in combination.
*   **Morbidity Management:**
    *   **Lymphedema:** Foot hygiene (washing with soap/water), elevation, exercise, anti-fungal creams.
    *   **Hydrocele:** Surgical operation (Hydrocelectomy).

### 7. Prevention and Control Strategy
The Government of India launched the **Accelerated Plan for Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (APELF)**. The goal is the Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (ELF) as a public health problem.

**Strategy:**
1.  Transmission Control via **[[Mass Drug Administration]] (MDA)**.
2.  Disability Prevention and Management (DPMP).

#### [[Mass Drug Administration]] (MDA)
This is the cornerstone of the elimination program.
*   **Concept:** Administering anti-filarial drugs to the **entire eligible population** in endemic areas once a year.
*   **Objective:** To reduce the density of microfilariae in the blood to a level where transmission cannot be sustained.
*   **Duration:** Must be continued for 5–6 years (life span of adult worm).

**Drug Regimens:**
Currently, two regimens are used depending on the district:
1.  **Double Drug Therapy (DA):**
    *   **DEC** (6 mg/kg) + **Albendazole** (400 mg).
2.  **Triple Drug Therapy (IDA) - "Ida":**
    *   **[[Ivermectin]]** (150-200 mcg/kg) + **DEC** + **Albendazole**.
    *   *Clinical Relevance:* IDA clears Mf faster and is more effective.

**Dosage Table for MDA (Age-based):**

| Age Group | DEC (100 mg tab) | Albendazole (400 mg) | Ivermectin (3 mg) [If used] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2 – 5 Years** | 1 Tablet | 1 Tablet | None (Excluded from Ivermectin) |
| **6 – 14 Years** | 2 Tablets | 1 Tablet | Based on height/weight |
| **15+ Years** | 3 Tablets | 1 Tablet | Based on height/weight |

**Exclusion Criteria (Who should NOT get MDA):**
1.  Children < 2 years (< 5 years for Ivermectin).
2.  Pregnant women.
3.  Seriously ill/debilitated persons.

**Vector Control:**
*   **Anti-larval:** Chemical (Temephos), Biological (Larvivorous fish - *Gambusia*), Environmental (removing *Pistia* plants for *Mansonia*).
*   **Anti-adult:** Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) is generally *not* cost-effective for Culex; personal protection (Bed nets/LLINs) is preferred.

### 8. Assessment Indicators
1.  **Microfilaria Rate:** % of people with Mf in blood.
2.  **Filarial Endemicity Rate:** % with Mf + % with Disease.
3.  **Transmission Assessment Survey (TAS):** Used to determine if MDA can be stopped.
