# [[Clinical Examination]] > Gait Analysis

### Definition
**Gait** is defined as a rhythmic, forward propulsive, coordinated movement of the body. It relies on the integrated function of the [[Central Nervous System]], [[Peripheral Nervous System]], labyrinthine function, and a healthy musculoskeletal system (bones, joints, and muscles).

### The Normal Gait Cycle
The gait cycle begins when the heel of one foot strikes the ground and ends when the same foot strikes the ground again. It consists of two main phases:

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Pie chart or linear bar showing the Gait Cycle divisions: Stance Phase (60%) and Swing Phase (40%) with their subdivisions

#### 1. Stance Phase (60%)
This is the weight-bearing phase where the foot is in contact with the ground.
*   **Heel Strike (Initial Contact):** The heel touches the ground.
*   **Foot Flat (Loading Response):** The sole makes full contact with the ground.
*   **Mid-stance (Single Leg Support):** The body weight passes directly over the supporting leg.
*   **Heel Off (Terminal Stance):** The heel lifts, propelling the body forward.
*   **Toe Off (Pre-swing):** The toe leaves the ground, ending the stance phase.

#### 2. Swing Phase (40%)
This phase occurs when the foot is off the ground and moving forward.
*   **Acceleration (Initial Swing):** The leg swings forward from the hip.
*   **Mid-swing:** The leg passes the opposite stance leg.
*   **Deceleration (Terminal Swing):** The leg slows down to prepare for the next heel strike.

### Pathological (Abnormal) Gaits
Abnormalities in gait can result from pain, muscle weakness, bony deformity, joint stiffness, or neurological disorders.

#### 1. Pain-Related Gait
*   **[[Antalgic Gait]] (Painful Gait):**
    *   **Mechanism:** The patient minimizes the time spent in the **stance phase** on the affected (painful) side to reduce weight-bearing. The body weight is shifted quickly to the normal leg.
    *   **Appearance:** A "dot-dash" rhythm; a short step on the affected side and a regular step on the normal side.
    *   **Causes:** Trauma, acute infection (e.g., [[Septic Arthritis]]), osteoarthritis, or any painful condition of the lower limb.

#### 2. Neuromuscular Gaits
*   **[[Trendelenburg Gait]] (Abductor Lurch):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Weakness of the hip abductors ([[Gluteus Medius]] and Minimus). Normally, these muscles stabilize the pelvis during the single-leg stance. When weak, the pelvis drops to the opposite (unaffected) side.
    *   **Appearance:** The patient lurches (leans) the trunk towards the **affected** side to shift the center of gravity and prevent the pelvic drop.
    *   **Causes:** Polio, [[Fracture Neck of Femur]], superior gluteal nerve injury.
*   **[[Waddling Gait]]:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Bilateral weakness of hip abductors or hip dislocation.
    *   **Appearance:** The trunk is thrown from side to side with each step (like a duck).
    *   **Causes:** Bilateral [[Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip]] (DDH), muscular dystrophy.
*   **[[High-Stepping Gait]] (Foot Drop Gait):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Weakness or paralysis of the ankle dorsiflexors (mainly [[Tibialis Anterior]]).
    *   **Appearance:** The patient lifts the leg higher than normal during the swing phase to allow the dropped foot to clear the ground. The foot may "slap" the ground at heel strike.
    *   **Causes:** [[Common Peroneal Nerve]] palsy, Sciatic nerve injury, Polio, Leprosy.
*   **[[Hand-Knee Gait]] (Quadriceps Gait):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Weakness of the [[Quadriceps]] muscle.
    *   **Appearance:** The patient supports the knee anteriorly with their hand when taking weight on the affected leg to prevent the knee from buckling (giving way).
    *   **Causes:** Polio, Quadriceps tendon rupture.
*   **Scissoring Gait:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Spasticity of the hip adductors.
    *   **Appearance:** The legs cross in front of each other during walking due to severe adduction.
    *   **Causes:** [[Cerebral Palsy]] (Spastic Diplegia).
*   **[[Ataxic Gait]]:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Loss of balance or proprioception.
    *   **Appearance:** Irregular, broad-based gait with uncontrollable staggering.
    *   **Causes:** Cerebellar pathology, posterior column lesions.

#### 3. Structural/Joint Deformity Gaits
*   **Short-Leg Gait:**
    *   **Appearance:** A regular, even dip of the shoulder and pelvis on the shortened side.
*   **Stiff Hip Gait:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Loss of motion at the hip joint.
    *   **Appearance:** The patient lifts the pelvis and swings the entire leg forward in one piece. Forward-backward movement of the lumbar spine is used for propulsion.
    *   **Causes:** Ankylosis (Bony or Fibrous), Tuberculosis of the hip.
*   **[[Alderman's Gait]]:**
    *   **Appearance:** The patient walks with small steps and a rigid, straight back to avoid jarring the spine.
    *   **Causes:** [[Tuberculosis of the Spine]] (Pott’s Disease) or other painful spinal conditions.

#### 4. Cerebral Palsy Specific Gaits
Specific patterns seen in CP due to combinations of spasticity and weakness:
*   **True Equinus:** Gastrosoleus spasticity leads to ankle plantarflexion.
*   **Jump Knee Gait:** Hip and knee flexion due to psoas and hamstring spasticity + ankle equinus.
*   **Apparent Equinus:** Hip and knee flexion make the foot appear in equinus, though the ankle range may be normal.
*   **Crouch Gait:** Excessive dorsiflexion at the ankle with flexion at the hip and knee.

### Summary Table of Common Gaits

| Gait Type | Primary Defect | Characteristic Sign | Common Etiology |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Antalgic** | Pain | Short stance phase on affected side | Arthritis, Trauma, Infection |
| **Trendelenburg** | Abductor weakness | Lurch towards affected side | Polio, # Neck Femur, Hip surgery |
| **Waddling** | Bilateral abductor weakness | Bilateral lurching | Bilateral DDH, Myopathy |
| **High Stepping** | Dorsiflexor paralysis | Foot drop, high leg lift | Common Peroneal Nerve Palsy |
| **Hand-Knee** | Quadriceps weakness | Hand pushes knee into extension | Polio |
| **Scissoring** | Adductor spasticity | Legs cross over midline | Cerebral Palsy |
| **Alderman's** | Spinal pain/stiffness | Rigid back, small steps | TB Spine (Pott's Disease) |

### Clinical Implications
*   **Observation:** Gait examination begins the moment the patient enters the room. Observe the patient walking with and without shoes if possible.
*   **Walking Cycle:** Break down the observation into heel-strike, stance, push-off, and swing-through to identify the specific defect (e.g., failure of heel strike suggests fixed equinus).
*   **Neurological Link:** A high-stepping gait usually signifies a distal lesion (foot drop), whereas a waddling gait suggests a proximal lesion (hip/muscle girdle).

### Mnemonic
**"WASH"** your hands before examining the gait:
*   **W**addling (Bilateral hip dislocation/myopathy)
*   **A**ntalgic (Pain)
*   **S**cissoring (CP) / **S**hort leg
*   **H**igh stepping (Foot drop)
