# Senile Cataract: Overview

**Senile Cataract** (Age-Related Cataract) is the most common type of acquired cataract, typically affecting persons above the age of 50 years. It is bilateral but often develops earlier in one eye than the other. It involves the opacification of the normally transparent [[crystalline lens]] or its capsule due to degenerative processes.

### Etiopathogenesis
The exact etiology is multifactorial, involving oxidative damage to lens proteins and lipids due to deficient anti-oxidant mechanisms.
*   **Risk Factors:** Age (most important), Sunlight/UV radiation, Smoking, Diabetes, Dehydration (severe diarrheal crisis), and Heredity.
*   **Biochemical Mechanism:**
    *   **Cortical:** Decreased total proteins/amino acids/potassium, increased Sodium, and marked **hydration** of the lens.
    *   **Nuclear:** Intensification of age-related nuclear sclerosis, dehydration, compaction of nucleus, and increase in water-insoluble proteins (HM3, HM4).

## Morphological Types

Senile cataract is morphologically classified into two main types based on the location of opacification: **Cortical** and **Nuclear**.

### 1. Nuclear Cataract (Nuclear Sclerosis)
This involves the sclerosis of the central nuclear fibers while the cortical fibers remain transparent initially. It tends to occur earlier than the cortical variety, often soon after 40 years of age.

*   **Pathology:**
    *   **Sclerosis:** The nucleus becomes hard and inelastic due to dehydration and compaction.
    *   **Pigmentation:** Deposition of urochrome and melanin pigments derived from amino acids (tryptophan).
    *   **Refractive Index:** Progressive increase in the refractive index of the nucleus.

*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Second Sight Phenomenon (Index Myopia):** Due to the increased refractive index, the eye becomes myopic. Presbyopic patients may regain the ability to read without glasses.
    *   **Visual Loss:** Distance vision deteriorates more than near vision.
    *   **Color Shift:** Poor hue discrimination at the blue end of the spectrum due to yellowing/browning of the lens acting as a filter.
    *   **Day Blindness (Hemeralopia):** Vision is worse in bright light because pupillary constriction restricts light entry to the central opacified nucleus.

*   **Grading of Nuclear Color:**
    *   **Grade 1:** Grey/Yellowish.
    *   **Grade 2:** Amber.
    *   **Grade 3:** Brown ([[Cataracta Brunescens]]).
    *   **Grade 4:** Black ([[Cataracta Nigra]]).
    *   **Rare:** Red ([[Cataracta Rubra]]).

### 2. Cortical Cataract (Soft Cataract)
This involves the opacification of the superficial lens cortex. It is the most common form of senile cataract (approx. 70%).

*   **Pathology:**
    *   Hydration leading to the formation of water clefts and vacuoles.
    *   Separation of lens fibers ([[Lamellar separation]]).
    *   Coagulation of proteins.

*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Glare:** Intolerance to bright light (headlights) due to scattering of light.
    *   **Uniocular Polyopia:** Doubling or trebling of objects due to irregular refraction.
    *   **Colored Halos:** Breaking of white light into a colored spectrum.
    *   **Vision:** Visual loss is delayed as opacities start peripherally. Vision improves in bright light (pinhole effect) or when the pupil is contracted.

#### Stages of Maturation (Cortical Cataract)

| Stage | Pathological Features | Clinical Signs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Lamellar Separation** | Formation of water clefts and vacuoles due to hydration. | Demonstrable only by slit-lamp. Reversible changes. |
| **2. Incipient Cataract** | **Cuneiform Opacities:** Wedge-shaped radial spokes extending from equator to center. <br> **Cupuliform:** Posterior subcapsular opacity (loss of vision is earlier here). | Cuneiform opacities seen as dark lines against red fundal glow. Most common in lower nasal quadrant. |
| **3. Immature Senile Cataract (ISC)** | Opacification increases but clear cortex remains. <br> **Intumescent Cataract:** Lens becomes swollen due to continued hydration. | **Iris Shadow Test:** Positive (Iris throws a shadow on the lens). <br> Lens appears greyish white. |
| **4. Mature Senile Cataract (MSC)** | Complete opacification of the cortex. | **Iris Shadow Test:** Negative (No clear cortex left). <br> Lens appears **Pearly White**. |
| **5. Hypermature Senile Cataract (HMSC)** | **Morgagnian:** Cortex liquefies, nucleus sinks to bottom. <br> **Sclerotic:** Cortex disintegrates, lens shrinks, anterior capsule thickens. | **Morgagnian:** Milky white bag of fluid with semicircular line of sunken nucleus. <br> **Sclerotic:** Dirty white shrunken lens, tremulous iris ([[Iridodonesis]]). |

## Comparison: Cortical vs. Nuclear Cataract

| Feature | Cortical Cataract | Nuclear Cataract |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Age of Onset** | Usually >50 years (Classic senile) | Often earlier (>40 years) |
| **Pathogenesis** | Hydration and protein coagulation | Sclerosis and dehydration |
| **Location** | Peripheral cortex (Cuneiform) | Central nucleus |
| **Visual Disturbance** | Glare, Uniocular polyopia, Colored halos | Blurring, Poor hue discrimination |
| **Visual Acuity** | Vision better in dim light (pupil dilation bypasses peripheral opacities) | Vision better in bright light/near (pupil constriction improves depth of focus, "Second Sight") |
| **Refractive Change** | Astigmatism or Hypermetropia | **Index Myopia** |
| **Iris Shadow** | Present in Immature stage | Absent |
| **Ophthalmoscopy** | Black spokes against red reflex | Central dark area against red reflex |
| **Hardness** | Soft (in early stages) | Hard |

## Clinical Implications & Complications

**1. Phacomorphic Glaucoma:**
*   Occurs during the **Intumescent stage** of cortical cataract.
*   The swollen lens pushes the iris forward $\rightarrow$ secondary [[angle-closure glaucoma]].

**2. Phacolytic Glaucoma:**
*   Occurs in **Morgagnian (Hypermature)** cataract.
*   Lens proteins leak through the capsule $\rightarrow$ engulfed by macrophages $\rightarrow$ clog the trabecular meshwork $\rightarrow$ secondary [[open-angle glaucoma]].

**3. Subluxation/Dislocation:**
*   Occurs in **Sclerotic Hypermature** cataract due to degeneration of zonules.

**4. Frequent Change of Glasses:**
*   Early symptom of cataract due to rapid changes in refractive index (Index myopia in nuclear, irregular refraction in cortical).
