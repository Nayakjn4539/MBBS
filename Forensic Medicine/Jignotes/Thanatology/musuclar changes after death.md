# [[Thanatology]] > musuclar changes after death

### Muscular Changes After Death

Following [[Somatic Death]], the muscles of the body undergo specific physicochemical changes in a sequential order. These changes are crucial for estimating the [[Time Since Death (TSD)]].

The sequence of changes is:
1.  **Primary Flaccidity**
2.  **Rigor Mortis** (Cadaveric Rigidity)
3.  **Secondary Flaccidity**

---

### 1. Primary Flaccidity
Immediately after somatic death, all muscles (voluntary and involuntary) lose their tone and become flaccid.
*   **Mechanism:** Loss of nerve supply and coordination.
*   **Features:**
    *   Complete relaxation of muscles.
    *   Lower jaw drops, eyelids lose tension.
    *   Limbs are flaccid and joints are flexible.
    *   **Contact Flattening:** Muscles flatten over areas of contact with the surface.
    *   **Chemical State:** Muscles are alkaline. [[ATP]] is still present, permitting the splitting of actin-myosin cross-bridges.
    *   **Reactivity:** Muscles may still respond to mechanical or electrical stimuli (Supravital reaction).
*   **Duration:** Lasts for **1–2 hours** until Rigor Mortis sets in.

---

### 2. Rigor Mortis (Cadaveric Rigidity)
This is the state of stiffening of muscles with slight shortening of fibers after death. It is a sign of **molecular death** of the muscle.

#### Pathophysiology (Mechanism)
*   **In Life:** Muscle contraction/relaxation requires energy in the form of Adenosine Triphosphate ([[ATP]]). ATP is required to separate **Actin** and **Myosin** filaments to allow relaxation.
*   **After Death:**
    *   ATP is progressively destroyed and not resynthesized.
    *   Sarcoplasmic reticulum integrity is lost $\rightarrow$ Calcium floods the sarcomeres.
    *   Actin and Myosin filaments combine to form a rigid, gel-like complex called **[[Actomyosin]]**.
    *   Since no ATP is available to break this bond, the muscle remains in a state of irreversible contraction/stiffness.
    *   Reaction becomes **Acidic** due to accumulation of lactic acid (glycogenolysis).

#### Progression (Nysten's Law)
Rigor mortis generally follows a descending order known as **[[Nysten's Law]]**:
1.  **Eyelids** (First to appear).
2.  Jaw and facial muscles.
3.  Neck.
4.  Thorax.
5.  Upper limbs.
6.  Abdomen.
7.  Lower limbs.
8.  Fingers and toes (Last to appear).

*Note: It disappears in the same order.*

#### Rule of 12 (March of 12)
In temperate climates, the timeline is often described as:
*   **12 Hours:** Takes to develop fully (stiffening).
*   **12 Hours:** Remains fully established (maintains stiffness).
*   **12 Hours:** Takes to pass off (secondary flaccidity).

*(Note: In tropical climates like India, this timeline is accelerated. Onset: 1-2 hours; Peak: 12 hours; Disappears: 24-36 hours).*

#### Factors Affecting Rigor Mortis
1.  **Temperature:** Heat accelerates rigor; Cold retards it. (Rigor may persist for days in refrigerated bodies).
2.  **Muscular Activity:** Exhaustion/Convulsions prior to death (e.g., [[Strychnine poisoning]], Tetanus, Epilepsy) $\rightarrow$ Early onset and short duration (due to pre-depleted ATP).
3.  **Age/Physique:**
    *   **Children/Old age:** Rapid onset, weak rigor, passes off quickly.
    *   **Muscular/Healthy:** Slow onset, strong rigor, lasts longer.
    *   **Fetus < 7 months:** Rigor mortis is **absent**.

#### Medicolegal Importance
*   **Sign of Death:** Confirms molecular death.
*   **Time Since Death (TSD):** Estimation based on extent/presence.
*   **Position of Body:** Indicates the position of the body at the time rigor set in. If a body is moved *after* rigor is established, the stiffness will maintain the original posture (e.g., a limb raised in the air defying gravity).

---

### 3. Cadaveric Spasm (Instantaneous Rigor)
A rare condition where muscles stiffen **instantaneously** at the moment of death, skipping the stage of primary flaccidity.

*   **Mechanism:** Neurogenic failure coupled with complete exhaustion of [[ATP]] at the moment of death. The muscle goes directly from vital contraction to rigor.
*   **Predisposing Factors:** Sudden death associated with extreme **emotional tension** (fear, excitement) or **physical exhaustion**.
*   **Involvement:** Usually restricted to a single group of voluntary muscles (e.g., hand gripping a weapon). Rarely generalized.
*   **Resolution:** It passes off only when rigor mortis passes off (during putrefaction).

#### Medicolegal Importance of Cadaveric Spasm
1.  **Diagnosis of Suicide:** A weapon (pistol/knife) firmly grasped in the hand suggests suicide. It is impossible to simulate this after death (a dead hand cannot grasp).
2.  **Diagnosis of Homicide:** Hair or clothing of the assailant grasped in the victim's hand.
3.  **Diagnosis of Accident:** Weeds/grass grasped in the hands of a body found in water indicates the person was alive when they entered the water (Antemortem [[Drowning]]).

### Comparison: Rigor Mortis vs Cadaveric Spasm

| Feature | Rigor Mortis | Cadaveric Spasm |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Onset** | Delayed (1-2 hours after death) | Instantaneous (At moment of death) |
| **Preceding Stage** | Primary Flaccidity | **No** Primary Flaccidity |
| **Mechanism** | Depletion of ATP | Neurogenic / Pre-death ATP exhaustion |
| **Muscles Involved** | All muscles (Voluntary & Involuntary) | Usually localized group of voluntary muscles (e.g., hands) |
| **Muscle Response** | Does not respond to electrical stimuli | Responds to electrical stimuli |
| **Molecular Death** | Occurs | Does not occur (at onset) |
| **Body Heat** | Body is cold | Body is warm |
| **Force to Break** | Moderate force | Very great force required |
| **Significance** | Estimates Time Since Death (TSD) | Indicates **Mode** of Death (Suicide/Homicide) |

### Other Forms of Stiffening (Conditions Simulating Rigor)

1.  **Heat Stiffening:**
    *   **Cause:** Exposure to temperatures > 65°C (e.g., Burns, high voltage [[Electrocution]]).
    *   **Mechanism:** Coagulation of muscle proteins.
    *   **Appearance:** "Pugilistic Attitude" (Boxer's stance) – Flexion of limbs due to coagulation.
    *   **Distinction:** Muscles are cooked, pale, and do not rot easily.

2.  **Cold Stiffening:**
    *   **Cause:** Exposure to freezing temperatures.
    *   **Mechanism:** Freezing of body fluids and solidification of subcutaneous fat.
    *   **Distinction:** Stiffness disappears if the body is moved to a warmer environment (Rigor returns/continues).

3.  **Gas Stiffening:**
    *   **Cause:** [[Decomposition]].
    *   **Mechanism:** Accumulation of putrefactive gases in tissues inflating and stiffening the body.
    *   **Distinction:** Associated with foul smell, greenish discoloration, and bloating.

---

### 4. Secondary Flaccidity
*   **Onset:** After rigor mortis passes off (approx. 24-36 hours in tropics).
*   **Mechanism:** Onset of [[Putrefaction]]. Autolytic enzymes and bacterial activity break down the coagulated muscle proteins (Actomyosin).
*   **Features:** Muscles become soft and flaccid again. Do not respond to stimuli.

### Mnemonics for Exams

*   **Rule of 12 (Rigor Timeline):** 12 to come, 12 to stay, 12 to go.
*   **Nysten's Law Order:** **E**very **J**aw **N**eeds **T**o **U**nderstand **A**natomy **L**aws.
    *   ( **E**yelids $\rightarrow$ **J**aw $\rightarrow$ **N**eck $\rightarrow$ **T**horax $\rightarrow$ **U**pper limbs $\rightarrow$ **A**bdomen $\rightarrow$ **L**ower limbs)
*   **Comparison:** **R**igor **M**ortis = **R**elaxation **M**issing (Eventually). **C**adaveric **S**pasm = **C**ontinues **S**traightaway.
