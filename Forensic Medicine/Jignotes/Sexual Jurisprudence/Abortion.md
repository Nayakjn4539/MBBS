# [[Sexual Jurisprudence]] > Abortion

### **ABORTION**

**Definition**
*   **Medical:** The expulsion or extraction from its mother of an embryo or fetus weighing 500g or less (approximately 22 weeks gestation) when it is not capable of independent survival [[Viability]].
*   **Legal (India):** Premature expulsion of the fetus from the mother's womb at any time of pregnancy before the full term is completed.
*   **Miscarriage:** Legally synonymous with abortion.

---

### **Classification**
1.  **Natural (Spontaneous):** Due to pathology in the mother or fetus (e.g., chromosomal defects, infections, trauma).
2.  **Artificial (Induced):**
    *   **Legal:** [[Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act]].
    *   **Illegal:** [[Criminal Abortion]].

### **Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971**
This Act legalizes abortion in India under specific conditions to protect maternal health.

#### **Indications for MTP**
*Mnemonic: **THE S**ocial **E**nvironment*
1.  **T**herapeutic: Continuation of pregnancy endangers the life of the pregnant woman or causes grave injury to her physical/mental health.
2.  **H**umanitarian: Pregnancy caused by [[Rape]]. (Anguish of rape constitutes grave injury to mental health).
3.  **E**ugenic: Substantial risk that the child, if born, would suffer from physical or mental abnormalities so as to be seriously handicapped.
4.  **S**ocial: Pregnancy resulting from failure of any contraceptive device used by a married woman or her husband (limited to married women in the original Act, but interpretations vary).
5.  **E**nvironmental: Lunacy or environmental factors.,

#### **Rules and Regulations (MTP Act)**
| Feature | Requirement | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Who can perform?** | **Registered Medical Practitioner (RMP)** with: <br> 1. PG Degree/Diploma in OBG. <br> 2. 6 months house surgency in OBG. <br> 3. 1 year experience in OBG hospital practice. <br> 4. Assisted in 25 MTPs (certified by CMO). | |
| **Duration & Opinion** | **Up to 12 weeks:** Opinion of **one** RMP. <br> **12 to 20 weeks:** Opinion of **two** RMPs. <br> **Any duration:** One RMP (If immediate necessity to save woman's life). |, |
| **Place** | Government hospital or a place approved by the Government/CMO. | |

### **Criminal Abortion**
Unlawful destruction or expulsion of the fetus from the mother's womb when there is no therapeutic indication. Usually performed by unskilled persons (quacks, dais) or the woman herself.

#### **Methods of Procuring Criminal Abortion**
**1. General Violence** (To exhaust the woman)
*   Severe exercise, carrying heavy weights, cycling, jumping.
*   **Cupping:** Application of a cup over a candle on the abdomen (vacuum effect).
*   Abdominal kneading/massage (*Bansdola* type pressure).

**2. Local Violence** (Direct interference)
*   **Abortion Stick:** A stick (calotropis, oleander, bamboo) smeared with irritants (asafoetida, red lead, arsenic) is inserted into the os uteri. Can cause perforation and sepsis.
*   **Syringing:** Higginson’s syringe used to pump soapy water/fluid into the uterus to detach the sac. High risk of [[Air Embolism]] and Vagal Inhibition.
*   **Rupture of membranes:** Using knitting needles, hairpins, sounds.
*   **Electricity:** Passing low voltage current through the uterus.

**3. Abortifacient Drugs**
*   **Ecbolics:** Increase uterine contractions (e.g., Ergot, Quinine, Synthetic oxytocin/prostaglandins).
*   **Emmenagogues:** Increase menstrual flow (e.g., Estrogens, Borax, Sanguinarine).
*   **Irritants:**
    *   *GIT Irritants:* Castor oil, Croton oil, Aloes (cause reflex uterine contraction).
    *   *Genito-urinary Irritants:* Cantharides, Turpentine, Potassium Permanganate.
*   **Systemic Poisons:** Lead (plumbism), Arsenic, Mercury.,

### **Complications of Criminal Abortion**
**Immediate:**
1.  **Hemorrhage:** Severe bleeding from uterine/cervical tears.
2.  **Shock:** Neurogenic (pain/vagal inhibition) or Hemorrhagic.
3.  **[[Air Embolism]]:** Due to syringing (fluid mixed with air forced into uterine venous sinuses). Fatal dose ~100ml air.
4.  **Perforation:** Of uterus or vagina by unskilled instrumentation.

**Delayed:**
1.  **Sepsis:** Endometritis, peritonitis, septicemia (Clostridium welchii - Gas Gangrene).
2.  **Tetanus.**
3.  **Renal Failure:** Acute tubular necrosis (due to soap intoxication or shock).

### **Medicolegal Duties of a Doctor**
In cases of suspected criminal abortion:
1.  **Medical Duty:** Treat the patient immediately (Life saving is priority).
2.  **Professional Secrecy:** Do not divulge information to police voluntarily unless legally bound (varies by jurisdiction, generally privileged).
3.  **Dying Declaration:** If the patient is in danger of death, arrange for a magistrate to record the [[Dying Declaration]].
4.  **Evidence:** Keep samples of vomitus, urine, undergarments (if stained), and any expelled products.
5.  **Death:** If death occurs, **DO NOT** issue a death certificate. Inform police for [[Medicolegal Autopsy]].

### **Autopsy Findings in Criminal Abortion**

**External Findings:**
*   **Signs of Pregnancy:** Pigmentation of nipples (areola), linea nigra, striae gravidarum.
*   **Genital Injuries:** Contusions/abrasions on labia, vagina, or cervix (Tenaculum marks).
*   **Stains:** Blood or soapy fluid on perineum/thighs/clothes.
*   **Face:** Pallor (hemorrhage) or Cyanosis/congestion (if air embolism/shock).

**Internal Findings:**
*   **Uterus:** Enlarged, soft, congested. Look for perforation (probe carefully).
*   **Uterine Contents:** Fetus, placenta, blood clots, foreign bodies (stick, catheter), chemical burns (potassium permanganate causes ulcers).
*   **Abdominal Cavity:** Blood or pus (peritonitis).
*   **Ovaries:** Presence of Corpus Luteum.

**Specific Diagnosis: [[Air Embolism]]**
*   *Cause:* Syringing.
*   *Autopsy Test:* Open the chest. The heart is visualized. The right ventricle appears distended. Puncture the right ventricle under water (in the pericardial sac filled with water). **Bubbles of air escape.**
*   Blood in heart is frothy "churned up".

**Viscera Preservation:**
*   Stomach & Intestines (for oral poisons).
*   Liver, Kidney, Spleen.
*   **Uterus and Adnexa** (Preserve in rectified spirit/saline).
*   **Upper Vagina** (for local drugs).
*   Stick/Foreign body found (preserve separately).
