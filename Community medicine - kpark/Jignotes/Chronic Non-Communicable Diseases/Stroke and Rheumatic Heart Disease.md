# [[Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases]] > Stroke and Rheumatic Heart Disease

# Stroke (Cerebrovascular Accident)

### Definition
Stroke is defined by the [[World Health Organization (WHO)]] as "rapidly developed clinical signs of focal (or global) disturbance of cerebral function, lasting **more than 24 hours** or leading to death, with no apparent cause other than vascular origin".
*   *Note:* The 24-hour threshold excludes [[Transient Ischaemic Attacks (TIA)]], which are episodes of focal, reversible neurological deficit lasting <24 hours.

### Classification
Stroke syndromes differ in aetiology, prognosis, and treatment:
1.  **Ischaemic Stroke:**
    *   **Cerebral Thrombosis:** The most common cause of stroke.
    *   **Cerebral Embolism.**
    *   **Lacunar Infarcts.**
2.  **Haemorrhagic Stroke:**
    *   **Intracerebral Haemorrhage:** More common in Japan than elsewhere.
    *   **Subarachnoid Haemorrhage.**

### Risk Factors
Epidemiological studies indicate stroke does not occur at random. The risk factors often precede stroke by several years.

| **Modifiable Risk Factors** | **Non-Modifiable Risk Factors** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Hypertension]]** (Main risk factor for both thrombosis and haemorrhage) | **Age:** Incidence rises steeply with age. |
| **Cardiac abnormalities** (Left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac dilatation) | **Sex:** Incidence is higher in males than females. |
| **Diabetes Mellitus** | **Personal History:** 75% of stroke patients have associated CVD or diabetes. |
| **Smoking** and Obesity | |
| Elevated blood lipids | |

### Prevention and Control strategy
The aim is to apply effective measures at the community level.
1.  **Population Strategy:** Focus on shifting the population distribution of risk factors (e.g., blood pressure) towards biological normality. This involves lifestyle modifications like salt reduction, quitting smoking, and dietary changes.
2.  **High-Risk Strategy:** Screening for and controlling **[[Arterial Hypertension]]** (first priority). Early detection and management of diabetes and cardiac diseases.
3.  **Secondary Prevention:** Early detection and treatment of [[Transient Ischaemic Attacks (TIA)]] as they are warning signs of an impending stroke. Control of complications in acute stroke.

# Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD)

### Disease Overview
Rheumatic fever (RF) is a febrile disease affecting connective tissues, particularly the heart and joints. **[[Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD)]]** is the permanent damage to heart valves resulting from RF. It is a major public health problem in developing countries.

### Epidemiological Determinants
*   **Agent Factor:**
    *   **Causative Agent:** [[Group A Beta-haemolytic Streptococci]].
    *   **Specifics:** M type 5 serotype has the highest "rheumatogenic potential".
    *   **Nature:** RF is *not* a communicable disease itself, but it results from a communicable disease (Streptococcal pharyngitis).
*   **Host Factors:**
    *   **Age:** Typically 5–15 years (childhood and adolescence).
    *   **Sex:** Affects both sexes equally, but the prognosis is worse for females.
    *   **Socio-economic:** Associated with poverty, overcrowding, and poor housing.
*   **Environmental Factors:** High humidity and overcrowding facilitate the spread of streptococcal infection.

### Clinical Features
The onset is usually preceded by a sore throat 1–5 weeks earlier.
*   **Carditis:** Occurs in 60–70% of cases. Manifests as tachycardia, murmurs, and cardiac enlargement.
*   **Polyarthritis:** Migratory, involving large joints (knees, ankles, elbows). No residual damage.
*   **Chorea (Sydenham's Chorea):** Purposeless jerky movements.
*   **Subcutaneous Nodules:** Small, painless, non-tender nodules over bony prominences.
*   **Erythema Marginatum:** Pink rash with clear centers.

### Diagnosis: Revised Jones Criteria
Diagnosis requires **Two Major criteria** OR **One Major + Two Minor criteria** PLUS evidence of antecedent Group A Streptococcal infection.

| **Major Manifestations** | **Minor Manifestations** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **C**arditis | **Clinical:** Fever, Polyarthralgia |
| **A**rthritis (Migratory Polyarthritis) | **Laboratory:** Elevated acute phase reactants ([[ESR]], CRP, Leukocytosis) |
| **N**odules (Subcutaneous) | **ECG:** Prolonged P-R interval |
| **C**horea | |
| **ER**ythema Marginatum | |

*   **Mnemonic for Major Criteria:** **JONES** (Joints, O-shaped heart/Carditis, Nodules, Erythema marginatum, Sydenham's chorea) or **CANCER** (as used in the table above).

### Prevention and Treatment
1.  **Primary Prevention:** Early diagnosis and treatment of Streptococcal sore throat with Penicillin. However, this is logistically difficult in developing countries.
2.  **Secondary Prevention (Prophylaxis):** Preventing recurrence of RF in patients who have already had an attack.
    *   **Drug of Choice:** [[Benzathine Benzyl Penicillin]].
    *   **Dose:** 1.2 million units (adults) or 600,000 units (children) intramuscularly.
    *   **Frequency:** Every 3 weeks.
    *   **Duration:**
        *   Without carditis: At least 5 years or until age 21 (whichever is longer).
        *   With carditis (healed): 10 years or until age 40.
        *   Severe valvular disease: Life-long.
