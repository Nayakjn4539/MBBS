# [[SCREENING FOR DISEASES]] > Multiphasic screening

### Multiphasic Screening

**Definition**
Multiphasic screening is defined as the application of **[[two or more screening tests]]** in combination to a large number of people at one time, rather than carrying out separate screening tests for single diseases.

It acts as a logical extension of the annual health examination, designed to bring examinations within reach of large masses with minimal time and cost.

**Components of the Procedure**
The procedure is usually automated and rapid, involving appropriate staffing and equipment. It typically includes:
1.  **[[Health Questionnaire]]**: To gather history and symptoms.
2.  **Clinical Examination**: Basic physical check-up.
3.  **Measurements and Investigations**:
    *   Chemical and haematological tests on blood and urine specimens.
    *   Lung function assessment.
    *   Audiometry (hearing test).
    *   Measurement of [[visual acuity]].

**Key Objectives**
*   **Efficiency:** To perform multiple investigations rapidly.
*   **Case Detection:** To identify unrecognised diseases or defects in apparently healthy individuals.
*   **Optimization:** To conserve physician time by using technicians to administer simple tests.

**Evaluation and Current Status**
Despite its initial popularity, the utility of multiphasic screening has been heavily debated.

*   **Evidence from Trials:** Evidence from **[[Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)]]** (e.g., the South-East London study) indicated that multiphasic screening **did not show any significant benefit** in reducing mortality or morbidity in the population.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** It was found to increase the cost of health services without providing observable health benefits.
*   **Validity Issues:** In many current practices of multiphasic screening, many of the tests used have not been fully validated.

**Table: Advantages vs. Disadvantages of Multiphasic Screening**

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Efficiency** | Allows screening for multiple conditions (e.g., anemia, diabetes, vision) in a single visit. |
| **Time-Saving** | Rapid application to large groups of people. |
| **Resource Burden** | Can overburden the healthcare system with false positives and diagnostic demands. |
| **Outcome** | **No proven reduction** in morbidity or mortality in large populations. |

**Clinical Relevance**
In modern clinical practice, the concept of "executive health check-ups" or "whole body packages" offered by private hospitals is a form of **[[Multiphasic Screening]]**. However, as a public health policy, it is generally *not recommended* due to the low yield and high cost compared to selective or high-risk screening.
