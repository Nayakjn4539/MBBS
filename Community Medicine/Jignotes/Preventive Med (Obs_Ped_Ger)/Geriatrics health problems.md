# Geriatric Health Problems

**Geriatrics** is the branch of medicine dealing with the health and care of the [[elderly]]. **Gerontology** is the scientific study of the aging process.

In India, the percentage of the aged population is increasing due to improved life expectancy (demographic transition). The health problems of the aged can be broadly classified into four major categories:

### 1. Problems Due to the Ageing Process ([[Senescence]])
These are disabilities incident to the biological process of aging (deterioration in vitality).
*   **Vision:** [[Senile Cataract]], Glaucoma.
*   **Hearing:** Nerve deafness.
*   **Mobility:** Osteoporosis affecting mobility.
*   **Respiratory:** Emphysema.
*   **Neurological:** Failure of special senses.

### 2. Problems Associated with Long-term Illness (Chronic/Pathological)
These are degenerative diseases that are more frequent in older people.

| System/Category | Specific Conditions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cardiovascular** | **[[Atherosclerosis]]** (narrowing of vessels), High blood pressure, [[Ischaemic Heart Disease]] (Coronary Heart Disease). |
| **Locomotor** | Fibrositis, myositis, neuritis, gout, **Rheumatoid Arthritis**, [[Osteoarthritis]], Spondylitis of spine. These cause significant discomfort and disability. |
| **Genitourinary** | Enlargement of **[[Prostate]]** (BPH), dysuria, nocturia, frequency and urgency of micturition. |
| **Respiratory** | Chronic bronchitis, Asthma. |
| **Metabolic** | **[[Diabetes Mellitus]]**. |
| **Neoplasms** | **[[Cancer]]**: Incidence rises rapidly after age 40 (e.g., Prostate cancer after age 65). |
| **Accidents** | Bones become fragile due to decalcification. **Fracture neck of femur** is a very common geriatric problem following minor falls at home. |

### 3. Psychological Problems
Mental changes are often an inevitable accompaniment of old age.
*   **Mental Changes:** Impaired memory, rigidity of outlook, and dislike of change.
*   **Sexual Adjustment:**
    *   **Women:** Menopause (cessation of reproduction).
    *   **Men:** Diminution of sexual activity.
    *   *Result:* Irritability, jealousy, and despondency.
*   **Emotional Disorders:** Resulting from social maladjustment. Failure to adapt to aging leads to bitterness, inner withdrawal, depression, and even suicide. [[Senile Dementia]] and Alzheimer’s are major concerns.

### 4. Social and Economic Problems
*   **Economic:** Reduced income after retirement leads to a fall in living standards. Poverty is a major evil.
*   **Social Isolation:** Loss of status, loss of spouse/friends, and the breakdown of the joint family system lead to genuine loneliness (Mutually reinforcing with mental health issues).
*   **Dependency:** Physical dependency on children or institutions for daily activities.

### Mnemonic for Chronic Health Problems in Elderly
**"GRANDPA"**
*   **G** - Genitourinary (Prostate, nocturia)
*   **R** - Respiratory (Chronic bronchitis)
*   **A** - Accidents (Falls, fractures)
*   **N** - Neoplasms (Cancer) & Nutrition (Diabetes)
*   **D** - Degenerative Heart Diseases (HTN, IHD)
*   **P** - Psychological (Dementia, Depression)
*   **A** - Arthritis (Locomotor issues)

### Prevention and Control (Preventive Geriatrics)

**1. Primary Prevention (Health Promotion)**
*   **Diet/Nutrition:** Balanced diet, less saturated fats, more fruits/vegetables/calcium. Avoidance of obesity.
*   **Lifestyle:** Regular moderate physical exercise to maintain mobility and bone density.
*   **Habits:** Cessation of [[Smoking]] and moderation of Alcohol.
*   **Injury Prevention:** Safe home environment to prevent falls.

**2. Secondary Prevention (Early Diagnosis)**
*   **Periodic Screening:** For Hypertension, Diabetes, Cancer (Cervix, Breast, Prostate), and Glaucoma.
*   **Prompt Treatment:** Early management of minor ailments before they become disabling.

**3. Tertiary Prevention (Rehabilitation)**
*   **Rehabilitation:** Medical, social, and vocational rehabilitation to prevent "dehabilitation".
*   **Aids:** Provision of spectacles, hearing aids, dentures, and walking supports.
*   **Social Welfare:** Old age pensions, **[[National Policy for Older Persons]]**, and geriatric homes.

### Clinical Relevance

In clinical practice, **polypharmacy** (use of multiple drugs) is a major issue in geriatrics. Interactions between drugs for hypertension, diabetes, and arthritis must be carefully monitored to prevent iatrogenic complications.
