# [[Medicine And Social Sciences]] > Social Psychology and Doctor-Patient Relationship

### Social Psychology in Medicine

**[[Social Psychology]]** is the scientific study of how the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of individuals are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others. It bridges the gap between psychology (individual) and sociology (society).

*   **Scope:** It deals with human behavior in groups, crowds, mobs, and audiences. It helps explain mass phenomena like panic during epidemics or resistance to vaccination.
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   **Emotions:** Strong feelings (fear, anger, love) motivating behavior.
    *   **Attitudes:** Acquired characteristics/permanent ways of behaving. Attitudes are "caught, not taught".
    *   **Motivation:** The inner force driving an individual to action (e.g., to seek treatment).

### Doctor-Patient Relationship (DPR)

This is the core of medical practice. It is a social relationship involving complex interactions between the healer and the sufferer.

#### 1. Nature of the Relationship
*   **Voluntary Contract:** The patient enters voluntarily, agreeing to follow advice based on the doctor's technical superiority.
*   **Primary vs. Secondary:**
    *   *Professional View:* Secondary relationship (business deal, specific duration, transferable).
    *   *Patient View:* Primary relationship (continuous, involves faith/emotion, non-transferable).

#### 2. Levels of Communication in DPR
To be successful, a doctor must communicate on three distinct planes:

| Plane | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Emotional Plane** | Establishing **[[Rapport]]** and sympathy. Understanding the patient's fears and anxieties. This is why folk practitioners are often popular—they connect emotionally. |
| **Cultural Plane** | Understanding local beliefs/customs. Couching scientific advice in culturally acceptable terms (e.g., classifying medicine as "hot" or "cold" to fit local beliefs). |
| **Intellectual Plane** | Reducing the **[[Social Distance]]** between the educated physician and the illiterate/lay patient. Using simple language instead of medical jargon. |

#### 3. The "Sick Role" (Parsonian Theory)
Sociologist Talcott Parsons described illness not just as a biological state, but a social state called the **[[Sick Role]]**. Society allows deviation from normal behavior for the sick, provided they follow specific rules.

*   **Rights of the Sick:**
    1.  Exempt from normal social responsibilities (e.g., work, school).
    2.  Not held responsible for their condition (needs care).
*   **Obligations of the Sick:**
    1.  Must want to get well (illness is undesirable).
    2.  Must seek competent help and cooperate with the doctor.

#### 4. Barriers in DPR
*   **Social Distance:** Differences in social class, education, and economic status between doctor and patient.
*   **Specialization:** Modern specialists treat "organs" rather than "people," leading to depersonalization.
*   **Commercialization:** Erosion of trust due to the perception of medicine as a trade/industry.
*   **Legal Aspects:** The **[[Consumer Protection Act]]** (COPRA) has redefined the patient as a "consumer" and the doctor as a "service provider," altering the traditional trust-based dynamic.

### The Art of Interviewing
The interview is the primary tool for social scientists and doctors to elicit the social and psychological background of illness.

**Steps of a Medical Interview:**
1.  **Establishing Contact:** The first requisite.
2.  **Securing Rapport:** Creating a friendly atmosphere to gain confidence.
3.  **Recalling:** Helping the patient remember events.
4.  **Probe Questions:** Digging deeper into specific areas.
5.  **Encouragement:** Motivating the patient to talk.
6.  **Guiding:** Keeping the conversation relevant without offending.

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Compliance (Adherence):** A good DPR improves compliance. Patients are more likely to follow dietary advice or medication regimens if they trust the doctor and feel understood.
*   **Placebo Effect:** The doctor's personality and the patient's faith can act as a therapeutic agent, relieving symptoms without active medication.
*   **Diagnosis:** Understanding social psychology helps in diagnosing **[[Psychosomatic Disorders]]** where mental tension causes physical damage (e.g., hypertension, peptic ulcer).
