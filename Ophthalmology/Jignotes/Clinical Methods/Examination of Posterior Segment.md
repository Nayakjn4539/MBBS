# [[Clinical Methods]] > Examination of Posterior Segment

# Examination of the Posterior Segment

The examination of the posterior segment (fundus) involves visualizing the structures behind the crystalline lens, specifically the [[vitreous humour]], [[retina]], [[choroid]], and [[optic disc]]. A sequential approach is recommended to ensure no pathology is missed.

### 1. Routine of Examination
A standard protocol should be followed for comprehensive evaluation:
1.  **Plane Mirror Examination** (at 1 meter).
2.  **Distant Direct Ophthalmoscopy** (at 20–25 cm).
3.  **Direct Ophthalmoscopy**.
4.  **Slit-Lamp Biomicroscopy** (using auxiliary lenses).
5.  **Indirect Ophthalmoscopy**.

### 2. Distant Direct Ophthalmoscopy
This is performed using a self-illuminated [[ophthalmoscope]] or a plane mirror with a central hole.
*   **Technique:** Light is thrown into the patient's eye from a distance of 20–25 cm in a semi-dark room.
*   **Normal Finding:** A uniform red glow (red reflex) is observed in the pupillary area.
*   **Abnormal Findings:** Any opacity in the refractive media (cornea, lens, vitreous) appears as a black shadow against the red glow.

**Localization of Opacities (Parallactic Displacement):**
The patient is asked to move the eye up and down while the examiner observes the opacity.
*   **Against Motion:** Opacities *behind* the pupillary plane (e.g., [[posterior polar cataract]], vitreous opacities) move in the direction opposite to the eye movement.
*   **With Motion:** Opacities *in front* of the pupillary plane (e.g., corneal opacity) move in the same direction as the eye.
*   **Stationary:** Opacities *at* the pupillary plane (e.g., anterior lens capsule) do not change position significantly relative to the pupil.

### 3. Direct Ophthalmoscopy
This is the most common method for routine fundus examination, allowing visualization of the central fundus (posterior pole) up to the equator.

*   **Optics:** The emergent rays from the patient's retina reach the observer's retina. If both are emmetropic, the image is focused naturally. If refractive errors exist, correcting lenses (Rack of lenses) in the ophthalmoscope are used.
*   **Image Characteristics:**
    *   **Virtual** and **Erect**.
    *   **Magnified:** Approximately **15 times** in emmetropia (more in myopia, less in hypermetropia).
*   **Field of View:** Small, approximately **2 disc diameters (DD)** or about 10°.
*   **Technique:**
    1.  Performed in a semi-dark room.
    2.  Right eye of the observer examines the right eye of the patient (and Left for Left).
    3.  Observer moves as close to the patient's eye as possible.
*   **Disadvantages:** Lack of stereopsis (depth perception) and inability to view the far periphery or see through hazy media.

### 4. Indirect Ophthalmoscopy (IDO)
Introduced by Nagel (1864), this technique is essential for examining the peripheral retina and managing [[retinal detachment]].

*   **Optic Principle:** The eye is made highly myopic by placing a strong convex condensing lens (+14D, +20D, +30D) in front of it. This forms a real, inverted image between the lens and the observer.
*   **Image Characteristics:**
    *   **Real** and **Inverted** (both vertically and laterally).
    *   **Magnified:** Varies with the lens used (e.g., **2.5x to 5x** magnification).
*   **Field of View:** Large, approximately **8 disc diameters (DD)** or **45°**.
*   **Technique:**
    *   Patient is supine.
    *   Examiner uses a binocular headset and holds a convex lens (usually **+20D**) at arm's length.
    *   **Scleral Indentation:** Used to visualize the extreme periphery (ora serrata).

#### Comparison: Direct vs. Indirect Ophthalmoscopy

| Feature | Direct Ophthalmoscopy | Indirect Ophthalmoscopy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Image** | Virtual, Erect | Real, Inverted |
| **Magnification** | ~15x | ~2.5x to 5x (depends on lens) |
| **Field of View** | Small (~2 DD / 10°) | Large (~8 DD / 45°) |
| **Stereopsis** | Absent (Monocular) | Present (Binocular) |
| **Examination Distance** | Very close to patient | Arm’s length |
| **Media Clarity** | Not useful in hazy media | Useful in hazy media (bright light) |
| **Peripheral View** | Limited (up to equator) | Up to [[ora serrata]] (with indentation) |

### 5. Slit-Lamp Biomicroscopy of Fundus
Since the slit lamp focuses on the anterior segment, auxiliary lenses are required to visualize the posterior segment.

**Methods:**
1.  **Indirect Fundus Biomicroscopy (Non-contact):**
    *   Uses high power convex lenses (**+78D** or **+90D**).
    *   Forms a **real, inverted, and magnified** aerial image.
    *   Current standard for examining the [[optic disc]] and [[macula]].
2.  **Hruby Lens (Non-contact):**
    *   A plano-concave lens (**-58.6D**) attached to the slit lamp.
    *   Forms a **virtual, erect** image.
    *   Restricted field of view; mostly obsolete.
3.  **Contact Lens Biomicroscopy:**
    *   **Goldmann Three-Mirror Contact Lens:**
        *   **Central Lens:** Views posterior pole (30°).
        *   **Equatorial Mirror (Trapezoidal):** Views equator to mid-periphery.
        *   **Peripheral Mirror (Rectangular):** Views peripheral retina.
        *   **Gonioscopic Mirror (Smallest/Dome):** Views extreme periphery and angle.
    *   Image is virtual and erect for the central lens; reflected mirrors show opposite quadrants.

### 6. Systematic Fundus Evaluation Findings
During ophthalmoscopy, structures must be evaluated in a specific order:

#### A. Media
*   Check for transparency.
*   Opacities (corneal, lenticular, or vitreous) appear black against the red glow.

#### B. Optic Disc ([[Optic Nerve Head]])
*   **Size:** Average diameter **1.5 mm**.
*   **Shape:** Vertically oval or circular.
*   **Colour:** Pinkish with a central pale cup.
    *   *Hyperaemic:* [[Papilloedema]], [[Papillitis]].
    *   *Chalky White:* Primary [[optic atrophy]].
    *   *Waxy Yellow:* Consecutive optic atrophy (e.g., Retinitis Pigmentosa).
*   **Margins:** Well-defined. Blurred in papilloedema or neuritis.
*   **Cup-Disc Ratio (C:D):** Normal is **0.3**. Enlarged/deep cupping indicates [[glaucoma]].
*   **Neuroretinal Rim (NRR):** Thickness follows **ISNT rule** (Inferior > Superior > Nasal > Temporal).

#### C. Macula Lutea
*   Located temporal to the disc.
*   **Foveal Reflex:** A bright pinpoint reflection indicates a healthy foveola.
*   **Abnormalities:**
    *   *Cherry Red Spot:* [[Central Retinal Artery Occlusion]] (CRAO), Tay-Sachs.
    *   *Cystoid Macular Edema (CME):* Honey-comb appearance/Flower petal pattern on angiography.
    *   *Drusen:* Yellowish deposits in [[Age-Related Macular Degeneration]] (ARMD).

#### D. Retinal Vessels
*   **Arteries:** Bright red, narrower.
*   **Veins:** Purplish/darker red, wider.
*   **A:V Ratio:** Normal is **2:3**.
*   **Pulsations:** Spontaneous venous pulsation is normal (absent in papilloedema). Spontaneous arterial pulsation is **pathological** (e.g., Glaucoma, Aortic Regurgitation).

#### E. General Background
*   Check for haemorrhages (dot/blot vs. flame-shaped), exudates (hard vs. soft/cotton wool spots), and pigmentation.

### 7. Ancillary Investigations
When clinical examination is insufficient, special tests are used:

*   **Fundus Fluorescein Angiography ([[FFA]]):**
    *   Uses sodium fluorescein dye (blue excitation light -> yellow-green barrier filter).
    *   Visualizes retinal circulation.
    *   **Hyperfluorescence:** Leakage (CME), Staining (Drusen), Window defect (RPE atrophy).
    *   **Hypofluorescence:** Blockage (Blood), Ischemia (Capillary non-perfusion).
*   **Indocyanine Green Angiography ([[ICGA]]):**
    *   Visualizes **choroidal** circulation (e.g., in ARMD, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy).
*   **Optical Coherence Tomography ([[OCT]]):**
    *   Non-invasive "optical biopsy".
    *   Visualizes cross-sectional retinal layers.
    *   Diagnoses macular holes, edema, and subretinal fluid.
*   **Ultrasonography ([[USG]]):**
    *   **B-Scan:** Essential when media is hazy (dense cataract, vitreous haemorrhage) to rule out [[retinal detachment]] or tumours.
    *   **A-Scan:** Used for biometry (axial length measurement).
*   **Electrophysiology:**
    *   **[[Electroretinography]] (ERG):** Assesses photoreceptor function (a-wave) and bipolar cells (b-wave).
    *   **Electro-oculography ([[EOG]]):** Assesses RPE function (Arden’s ratio).
