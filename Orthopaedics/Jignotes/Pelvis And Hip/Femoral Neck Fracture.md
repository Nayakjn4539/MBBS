# [[Pelvis And Hip]] > Femoral Neck Fracture

# Femoral Neck Fracture (Intracapsular Fracture of the Hip)

Fractures of the neck of the femur are notoriously challenging injuries, often termed **"The Unsolved Fracture"** due to the high incidence of complications despite treatment,. These fractures occur within the joint capsule (intracapsular), distinguishing them from intertrochanteric fractures.

### Relevant Surgical Anatomy
The prognosis of these fractures depends entirely on the precarious blood supply to the femoral head.
*   **Blood Supply:** The femoral head is supplied by three sources:
    1.  **Retinacular Vessels (Main Source):** Branches of the [[Medial Circumflex Femoral Artery]] (and lateral circumflex) ascend along the neck. These are often torn in displaced fractures, leading to [[Avascular Necrosis]] (AVN).
    2.  **Intraosseous Vessels:** These are disrupted immediately upon fracture.
    3.  **Artery of Ligamentum Teres:** Supplies only a small portion of the head (negligible in adults).
*   **Healing Environment:** The femoral neck lacks a periosteal cambium layer (the osteogenic layer); therefore, healing occurs via **endosteal callus** only. Furthermore, synovial fluid in the joint contains fibrinolysins which may lyse the fracture hematoma, preventing clot formation and impeding union.

### Etiology and Mechanism of Injury
There is a bimodal distribution based on age and bone quality.
*   **Elderly (Osteoporotic bone):** Trivial trauma, such as a slip and fall on the side or twisting injury,. It is a pathological fracture secondary to [[Osteoporosis]].
*   **Young Adults:** High-velocity trauma (e.g., Road Traffic Accidents).

### Classification Systems

#### 1. Anatomical Classification
Based on the level of the fracture line,.
*   **Subcapital:** Just beneath the femoral head (Highest risk of AVN),.
*   **Transcervical:** Through the middle of the neck.
*   **Basicervical:** At the base of the neck (Junction of neck and shaft).

#### 2. Pauwel's Classification
Based on the angle of the fracture line relative to the horizontal plane.
*   **Type I:** < 30° (Compression forces dominate; Stable).
*   **Type II:** 30°–50° (Shearing forces increase).
*   **Type III:** > 50° (Shearing forces dominate; Highly Unstable).
*   **Clinical Implication:** The more vertical the fracture line, the higher the shearing force and the greater the risk of non-union.

#### 3. Garden's Classification (Most Widely Used)
Based on the displacement and alignment of the trabeculae on the AP X-ray,.

| Type | Description | Stability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type I** | Incomplete fracture or impacted in valgus. Trabeculae are distorted but continuous. | Stable |
| **Type II** | Complete fracture but **undisplaced**. Trabecular lines are broken but aligned. | Stable |
| **Type III** | Complete fracture with **partial displacement**. Trabeculae of the head do not line up with the acetabulum. | Unstable |
| **Type IV** | Complete fracture with **total displacement**. Femoral head aligns with acetabulum but not with the neck. | Unstable |

### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:** Pain in the groin or hip, inability to bear weight (though patients with impacted fractures might still walk).
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Tenderness:** Over the anterior hip joint line/Scarpa's triangle,.
    *   **Deformity:** The limb is **Shortened, Adducted, and Externally Rotated**.
    *   **Specific Note on Rotation:** The external rotation is usually **less than 45°** (limited by the intact iliofemoral ligament/capsule). In contrast, intertrochanteric fractures (extracapsular) can have external rotation up to 90°,.
    *   **Active Straight Leg Raising (SLR):** Usually not possible.

### Investigations
*   **X-ray:** AP view of the pelvis (showing both hips) and lateral view of the affected hip. Traction and internal rotation views may help define the fracture type.
*   **MRI:** The **Gold Standard** for diagnosing occult fractures (e.g., in elderly patients with hip pain after a fall but negative X-rays),.
*   **Bone Scan:** Can be used if MRI is unavailable, usually positive after 48–72 hours.

### Management Principles
Treatment depends heavily on the age of the patient and the displacement of the fracture.

**Goal:**
*   **Young:** Preserve the femoral head (Osteosynthesis).
*   **Elderly:** Early mobilization to prevent recumbency complications (Arthroplasty).

#### Management Algorithm

**1. Undisplaced Fractures (Garden I & II)**
*   **All Ages:** Internal Fixation is the standard.
*   **Method:** [[Cannulated Cancellous Screws]] (CCS) usually three screws in a triangular configuration.

**2. Displaced Fractures (Garden III & IV)**

*   **Young Patients (< 60 years):**
    *   **Priority:** Medical Emergency. Preserve the head.
    *   **Treatment:** Closed Reduction and Internal Fixation (CRIF).
    *   **Implants:** Multiple Cannulated Cancellous Screws (CCS) or [[Dynamic Hip Screw]] (DHS).
    *   *Note:* If closed reduction fails, Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF) is indicated.

*   **Elderly Patients (> 60 years):**
    *   **Priority:** Early mobilization. High risk of AVN and non-union with fixation.
    *   **Treatment:** Arthroplasty (Replacement),.
    *   **Options:**
        *   **Hemiarthroplasty:** Replacing only the femoral head (e.g., Austin Moore Prosthesis for osteoporotic bone, Thompson prosthesis, or Bipolar prosthesis),.
        *   **[[Total Hip Replacement]] (THR):** Indicated for active elderly patients, those with pre-existing osteoarthritis, or rheumatoid arthritis.

#### 3. Fractures in Children
*   **Treatment:** Urgent anatomical reduction and internal fixation (using Moore’s pins or cannulated screws) to prevent growth disturbance and AVN.

### Complications
Intracapsular fractures are prone to two major complications:

1.  **[[Avascular Necrosis]] (AVN):**
    *   **Cause:** Disruption of the retinacular vessels.
    *   **Incidence:** High in displaced fractures (up to 30%).
    *   **Diagnosis:** X-ray shows increased density (sclerosis) of the head; MRI detects it early,.
    *   **Management:** Core decompression (early), vascularized fibular graft, or Total Hip Replacement (late).

2.  **[[Non-Union]]:**
    *   **Cause:** Lack of cambium layer in periosteum, synovial fluid washing away the clot, poor vascularity, and high shearing forces (Pauwel's III),.
    *   **Management:**
        *   *Young:* Valgus Osteotomy (e.g., [[Pauwel's Osteotomy]]) to convert shearing forces into compression forces, or Muscle Pedicle Bone Grafting (Meyer's procedure).
        *   *Elderly:* Hemiarthroplasty or Total Hip Replacement.

### Clinical Implications (Pearls)
*   **Shenton’s Line:** A continuous arch formed by the inferior border of the superior pubic ramus and the medial cortex of the femoral neck. A break in this line on X-ray indicates a fracture or dislocation,.
*   **Trendelenburg Gait:** May develop due to shortening of the lever arm of the abductor mechanism in neglected or malunited fractures.
*   **Fracture of Necessity:** Femoral neck fractures are often called "fractures of necessity" because they almost always require surgical intervention for a good outcome.
