# Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)

A **Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)** is an experimental epidemiological study design where participants are randomly allocated into groups to receive or not receive an experimental preventive or therapeutic procedure. It is considered the **Gold Standard** of clinical research for evaluating the efficacy of new drugs or interventions.

### 1. Basic Steps of an RCT
Conducting an RCT involves a strict sequence of events to ensure validity.

**Mnemonic for Steps: P**lease **S**tart **R**andomization **M**anipulation **F**or **A**ccuracy
1.  **Drawing up a [[Protocol]]:** Specifies aims, sample size, selection criteria, and procedures to prevent bias.
2.  **Selecting Reference and Experimental Populations:**
    *   *Reference Population:* Target population to which results are applied.
    *   *Experimental Population:* The actual study sample derived from the reference population. Participants must give **informed consent**.
3.  **[[Randomization]]:** The "Heart" of the control trial.
4.  **Manipulation (Intervention):** Deliberate application or withdrawal of a suspected factor (e.g., giving a new vaccine).
5.  **Follow-up:** Examination of both groups at defined intervals. **Attrition** (loss to follow-up) is a major problem here.
6.  **Assessment of Outcome:** Comparing results (positive/negative) in both groups.

### 2. Randomization
This is the statistical procedure by which participants are allocated into groups (Study vs. Control).
*   **Core Principle:** Every individual has an **equal and known chance** of being allocated to either group.
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Eliminates **[[Selection Bias]]**.
    *   Ensures **Comparability**: Both known and unknown [[Confounding factors]] are distributed equally between groups.
    *   Superior to matching because it controls for unknown confounders.

### 3. Blinding
Blinding is a technique used to eliminate **Information/Observer Bias**. It keeps the participants, investigators, or analysts unaware of the group allocation.

| Type of Blinding | Who is Blinded? | Bias Removed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Single Blind** | Participant | Subject Bias |
| **Double Blind** (Most Common) | Participant + Investigator | Subject + Investigator Bias |
| **Triple Blind** (Ideal) | Participant + Investigator + Analyst | Subject + Investigator + Analyzer Bias |

*   **Open Trial:** A trial where everyone knows the allocation (e.g., surgical interventions where blinding is impossible).

### 4. Study Designs in RCT
*   **Concurrent Parallel Design:** Comparisons are made between two randomly assigned groups (one exposed to specific treatment, one not) simultaneously.
*   **Crossover Design:** Each patient serves as their own control. The group receiving the drug first later switches to the placebo, and vice versa, often after a "washout period" to remove the drug's effect. This design removes ethical concerns about denying treatment but is not suitable for diseases that are cured by the first intervention.

### 5. Phases of Clinical Trials
Before a new drug is released, it undergoes four phases.

**Mnemonic: SWIM** (Safety, Works?, Improvement, Market)
*   **Phase I (Safety):** Healthy human volunteers (20–80). Determines safety and **Maximum Tolerated Dose**. (Micro-dosing happens in Phase 0).
*   **Phase II (Works?):** Patients (100–300). Determines **Efficacy** and dosage.
*   **Phase III (Improvement):** Large group of patients (RCT). Comparison with **existing standard drugs**. New drugs are launched after this phase.
*   **Phase IV (Market):** **Post-Marketing Surveillance**. Done after the drug is launched to check for long-term side effects and rare adverse reactions.

### 6. Analysis: Intention-to-Treat (ITT)
In RCTs, analysis is often done by the **Intention-to-Treat** principle.
*   **Concept:** "Once randomized, always analyzed."
*   **Meaning:** Results are analyzed according to the group the subject was originally assigned to, regardless of whether they actually took the treatment, dropped out, or switched groups.
*   **Benefit:** It preserves the benefit of **[[Randomization]]** and reflects real-world non-compliance.

### 7. Summary: Advantages vs. Disadvantages

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Best evidence** for causality (Temporal association). | **Expensive** and time-consuming. |
| Eliminates **[[Confounding]]** via randomization. | **Ethical issues** (withholding treatment from controls). |
| Minimizes **Bias** via blinding. | **Attrition** (Loss to follow-up) can invalidate results. |
| Strict control over variables. | May lack **External Validity** (results may not apply to the general population due to strict inclusion criteria). |

**Clinical Relevance:**
RCTs are the basis of **[[Evidence-Based Medicine]]**. When reading a study about a new antihypertensive drug, always check if it was an RCT. If the study mentions "random allocation" but huge numbers of patients were lost to follow-up (attrition bias), the results might not be reliable. Always look for **Double-Blinding** to ensure the doctor's belief in the drug didn't influence the results (Placebo effect).
