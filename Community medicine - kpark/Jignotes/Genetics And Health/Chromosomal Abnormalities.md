# [[Genetics And Health]] > Chromosomal Abnormalities

### Chromosomal Abnormalities

Chromosomal abnormalities are numerical or structural alterations in chromosomes that occur during cell division. They are significant causes of [[congenital malformations]], embryonic wastage (abortions), and mental retardation.

### 1. Down's Syndrome (Mongolism)
This is the most common autosomal anomaly, also known as [[Trisomy 21]].

*   **Karyotype:** 47, XX + 21 or 47, XY + 21 (Presence of an extra chromosome 21).
*   **Incidence:** Approximately 1 in 900 births in European populations.
*   **Etiology/Risk Factors:**
    *   **Non-disjunction:** Failure of chromosome pairs to separate during cell division (most common).
    *   **Maternal Age:** The risk increases sharply with advanced maternal age.
        *   Age 20: 1 in 3000
        *   Age 40: 1 in 40.
    *   **Translocation:** A portion of chromosome 21 attaches to another chromosome (usually 14).
    *   **Mosaicism:** Some cells have 46 chromosomes, others have 47.

**Clinical Features:**
*   **Physical:** Short stature, small round head, flat face.
*   **Eyes:** Narrow, tilted eye-slits (Mongoloid slant), epicanthal folds.
*   **Ears:** Malformed, low-set ears.
*   **Hands:** Short broad hands, [[Simian crease]] (single transverse palmar crease).
*   **Systemic:** Congenital heart defects, atresia of the alimentary tract.
*   **Neurological:** Mental retardation (varying degrees).

> **Mnemonic for Down's Features:** **DOWN CHILD**
> *   **D**ecreased tone (Hypotonia)
> *   **O**ne crease (Simian crease)
> *   **W**idened space between big toe and second toe (Sandal gap)
> *   **N**uchal fold thickness increased
> *   **C**ongenital heart disease
> *   **H**ypothyroidism risk
> *   **I**ntellectual disability
> *   **L**ow set ears
> *   **D**epressed nasal bridge

**Prevention:**
*   **Prenatal Screening:** [[Amniocentesis]] or Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS) for high-risk mothers (age >35).
*   **Avoidance of Late Pregnancy:** Encouraging reproduction before age 30 can reduce incidence.

### 2. Klinefelter's Syndrome
This is the most common sex chromosome [[aneuploidy]] in males.

*   **Karyotype:** 47, XXY (Male with an extra X chromosome).
    *   Variants include XXXY or mosaic patterns.
*   **Incidence:** About 1 in 1,000 males at birth.
*   **Mechanism:** Non-disjunction of sex chromosomes during gametogenesis (maternal or paternal).

**Clinical Features:**
*   **Phenotype:** Appears male but with **eunuchoid** proportions (tall stature, long legs).
*   **Sexual Development:** Hypogonadism, small non-functional testes.
*   **Reproductive:** [[Azoospermia]] (absence of sperm), leading to infertility.
*   **Secondary Sexual Characters:** Scanty hair on face/axilla/pubis, **Gynaecomastia** (enlargement of breasts).
*   **Neurological:** Often associated with mental retardation or behavioral issues.

> **Mnemonic for Klinefelter's:** **KLINE**
> *   **K**aryotype 47, XXY
> *   **L**ong limbs
> *   **I**nfertility (Azoospermia)
> *   **N**o facial hair / Non-functional testes
> *   **E**levated Estrogen (Gynaecomastia)

### 3. Turner's Syndrome
This is a sex chromosome abnormality affecting females, characterized by the absence of one X chromosome ([[Monosomy]]).

*   **Karyotype:** 45, XO (Female with missing X).
*   **Incidence:** 1 in 7,500 live-born girls.
    *   *Note:* 98% of XO conceptuses abort spontaneously; it is a major cause of first-trimester miscarriage.
*   **Mechanism:** Non-disjunction (usually loss of paternal X).

**Clinical Features:**
*   **Phenotype:** Apparent female but with **short stature**.
*   **Sexual Development:** **Primary amenorrhea**, underdeveloped external genitalia/uterus (infantile), gonadal dysgenesis (streak ovaries).
*   **Reproductive:** Infertility.
*   **Physical Stigmata:** **Webbed neck**, low posterior hairline, shield chest with widely spaced nipples, cubitus valgus (wide carrying angle of arms).
*   **Systemic:** Coarctation of the aorta, renal malformations (horseshoe kidney).
*   **Neurological:** Usually normal intelligence, though some may have specific learning disabilities.

> **Mnemonic for Turner's:** **CLOWN**
> *   **C**oarctation of aorta / Cardiac defects
> *   **L**ymphoedema (hands/feet at birth)
> *   **O**varies undeveloped (Streak ovaries)
> *   **W**ebbed neck
> *   **N**ipples widely spaced (Shield chest)

### General Management & Prevention of Chromosomal Disorders

Since genetic constitution cannot be altered after conception, management focuses on early detection, counseling, and supportive care.

1.  **[[Genetic Counselling]]:**
    *   **Prospective:** Identifying high-risk individuals (e.g., advanced maternal age) before conception.
    *   **Retrospective:** Counseling parents after the birth of an affected child regarding the risk of recurrence.

2.  **Prenatal Diagnosis:**
    *   Indicated for mothers >35 years, previous child with chromosomal anomaly, or family history.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   **Amniocentesis:** Performed at 14–16 weeks; fetal cells cultured for [[karyotyping]].
        *   **Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS):** Performed at 9–11 weeks.
        *   **Biochemical Screening:** Triple/Quadruple markers in maternal serum (e.g., Alpha-fetoprotein).
        *   **Ultrasonography:** To detect structural anomalies (e.g., nuchal translucency).

3.  **Supportive Therapy:**
    *   Hormone replacement (e.g., Testosterone for Klinefelter's, Estrogen/Growth Hormone for Turner's).
    *   Surgical correction of cardiac or renal defects.
    *   Special education and vocational training for mental retardation.
