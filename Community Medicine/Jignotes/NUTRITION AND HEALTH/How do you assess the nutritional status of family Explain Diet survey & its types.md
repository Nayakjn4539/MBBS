# [[NUTRITION AND HEALTH]] > How do you assess the nutritional status of family Explain Diet survey & its types

### Assessment of Nutritional Status of a Family

Nutritional assessment of a family involves a comprehensive approach utilizing both direct and indirect methods. It determines the health status of the family unit based on the food they consume and the physical health of its members.

#### 1. Methods of Assessment
The assessment is broadly classified into two categories:

**A. Direct Methods (Focused on Individuals within the family)**
These methods deal with the individuals to detect clinical or sub-clinical malnutrition.
*   **[[Anthropometry]]:** Measurement of physical dimensions (Height, Weight, Mid-arm circumference, Skinfold thickness).
    *   *Tools:* Weighing scale, Infantometer/Stadiometer, Shakir's tape.
*   **Biochemical Tests:** Laboratory tests to detect sub-clinical deficiencies (e.g., Hemoglobin for Anemia, Urinary Iodine).
*   **Clinical Examination:** Head-to-toe examination looking for specific signs of deficiency (e.g., Bitot's spots, angular stomatitis, edema).
*   **Dietary Evaluation:** Assessing the food intake (Diet Survey).

**B. Indirect Methods (Focused on Community/Environment)**
*   **Vital Statistics:** Analysis of Morbidity and Mortality rates (e.g., IMR, MMR).
*   **Ecological Factors:** Assessment of socioeconomic status, food production, and cultural habits.

### Diet Survey

A **[[Diet Survey]]** is the systematic assessment of food consumption to determine the nutrient intake of a family or individual. The data collected is analyzed using food composition tables (e.g., *Nutritive Value of Indian Foods* by NIN) to calculate the intake of Energy, Proteins, Fats, and micronutrients. This is then compared against the **[[Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)]]**.

#### Calculation of Family Intake (Consumption Unit)
Since a family consists of members of different ages and genders, their intake cannot be simply averaged. We use the concept of **[[Consumption Unit (CU)]]**.
*   The reference **Adult Male (Sedentary worker)** is considered **1 CU**.
*   Other members are assigned coefficients based on their age/sex (e.g., Adult female = 0.8 CU).
*   **Formula:** $\text{Average Intake per CU} = \frac{\text{Total food cooked for family}}{\text{Total Consumption Units of family}}$

### Types of Diet Surveys

There are several methods to conduct a diet survey, chosen based on the target group (Family vs. Individual) and resources available.

#### 1. Weighment of Raw Foods (Gold Standard for Families)
This is the most widely used and practical method in India for assessing **family** dietary intake.
*   **Procedure:** The survey team visits the household and weighs all **raw food ingredients** before they are cooked.
*   **Duration:** Ideally conducted for **7 consecutive days** (one **[[Dietary Cycle]]**) to account for weekly variations in food habits (e.g., fasting days, weekend feasts). A minimum of 3 days can be done if resources are limited.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Weigh edible raw food before cooking.
    2.  Subtract plate waste or food discarded.
    3.  Calculate total daily consumption.
    4.  Divide by total Consumption Units (CU) to get per capita intake.
*   **Advantage:** Fairly accurate and practical.
*   **Disadvantage:** Intrusive; families may alter eating habits during the survey period.

#### 2. Weighment of Cooked Foods
*   **Procedure:** The cooked food is weighed just before consumption by the individual.
*   **Use:** Rarely used in field settings; mostly for research.
*   **Disadvantage:** Culturally less acceptable (weighing food on the plate is often considered taboo/rude) and labor-intensive.

#### 3. Oral Questionnaire (24-Hour Recall Method)
*   **Procedure:** The investigator asks the person (usually the mother/housewife) to recall all food and drink consumed in the previous **24 hours**.
*   **Tools:** Standardized cups/katoris (e.g., Spot U6-U8 in practicals) are used to estimate volumes.
*   **Use:** Useful for large-scale surveys (e.g., NNMB surveys) and individual assessment.
*   **Disadvantage:** Relies heavily on memory (Recall Bias) and honesty.

#### 4. Domestic Food Balance (Inventory Method)
*   **Procedure:**
    *   Inventory of food in the house is taken at the **beginning** of the week.
    *   Add: Food purchased/obtained during the week.
    *   Subtract: Food inventory remaining at the **end** of the week.
*   **Use:** Suitable for hostels, orphanages, or literate families keeping logbooks.

#### 5. Duplicate Sample (Aliquot) Method
*   **Procedure:** A duplicate sample of the exact meal eaten by the subject is collected and sent to a laboratory for chemical analysis.
*   **Use:** Highly accurate but expensive; used only for **metabolic research**.

#### 6. Diet History / Food Frequency Questionnaire
*   **Procedure:** Subjects are asked how often they consume specific food items (e.g., "How many times a week do you eat green leafy vegetables?").
*   **Use:** Good for assessing long-term habits and epidemiological studies on chronic diseases.

### Comparison of Common Methods

| Feature | Weighment of Raw Foods | Oral Questionnaire (24-hr Recall) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Accuracy** | High (Gold Standard) | Moderate (Subject to memory) |
| **Duration** | 7 Days (Dietary Cycle) | 24 Hours |
| **Unit** | Family | Individual/Large groups |
| **Resources** | Time-consuming | Quick and easy |
| **Bias** | Housewives may cook "better" food | Recall bias |

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Weighment Method** is crucial for identifying families below the poverty line regarding caloric intake.
*   **24-hour recall** is the standard for national surveys like **[[NFHS]]** to assess breastfeeding practices and complementary feeding.
*   Understanding the **Dietary Cycle** ensures that "fasting and feasting" days do not skew the data.
