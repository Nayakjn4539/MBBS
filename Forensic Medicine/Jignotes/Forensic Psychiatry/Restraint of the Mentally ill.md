# [[Forensic Psychiatry]] > Restraint of the Mentally ill

### **Restraint of the Mentally Ill**

**Restraint** is defined as the restriction of a person's freedom of movement, physical activity, or normal access to their body. In [[Forensic Psychiatry]], this involves both physical/chemical control of a violent patient and the legal detention of a patient in a psychiatric facility.

---

### **1. Indications for Restraint**
Restraint is a measure of **last resort**. It is justified only under the doctrine of **Necessity**.
*   **Danger to Self:** Active suicidal behavior or severe self-mutilation.
*   **Danger to Others:** Homicidal intent, physical assault, or extreme aggression towards staff/public.
*   **Serious Property Damage:** Violent destruction of hospital/public property.
*   **Disruption of Treatment:** When behavior severely compromises the treatment of the patient or others (e.g., pulling out lines in delirium).
*   **Legal Detention:** To prevent the escape of a patient committed under a Reception Order or Supported Admission.

> **Mnemonic: S.A.F.E.**
> *   **S** - **S**elf-harm risk
> *   **A** - **A**ggression towards others
> *   **F** - **F**ailure of verbal de-escalation
> *   **E** - **E**scape risk (if legally detained)

### **2. Types of Restraint**

#### **A. Physical/Mechanical Restraint**
*   **Definition:** Use of manual holds or mechanical devices (straps, belts) to limit movement.
*   **Protocol:**
    1.  **Least Restrictive:** Use the minimum force necessary.
    2.  **Team Approach:** Minimum 4–5 staff members (one for the head, one for each limb).
    3.  **Position:** Supine is preferred. **Avoid Prone positioning** due to the risk of [[Positional Asphyxia]].
    4.  **Monitoring:** Constant observation required. Check circulation/nerves every 15 minutes.

#### **B. Chemical Restraint (Rapid Tranquillization)**
*   **Definition:** Use of medication to restrict freedom of movement or to manage behavior.
*   **Standard Regimen:**
    *   **Oral:** Preferred first line (e.g., Lorazepam).
    *   **Parenteral (IM):** If oral is refused or ineffective. Common combination: **Haloperidol + Promethazine** or **Lorazepam**.
    *   **Intravenous (IV):** Used in extreme cases (e.g., Diazepam) but carries risk of respiratory depression.
*   **Caution:** Avoid in head injury or alcohol intoxication if possible due to CNS depression masking symptoms.

#### **C. Environmental Restraint (Seclusion)**
*   Confinement of a patient in a room from which they cannot exit freely.
*   Must be well-lit, ventilated, and monitored.
*   **Prohibited:** Solitary confinement for long periods without review is a violation of human rights.

### **3. Legal Provisions in India**

The legal landscape shifted significantly from the **Mental Health Act (MHA) 1987** to the **Mental Healthcare Act (MHCA) 2017**.

#### **A. Under Mental Healthcare Act (MHCA) 2017**
This act decriminalized suicide and focused on rights.
*   **Prohibited Procedures:**
    *   **Chaining:** Keeping a patient chained is strictly prohibited.
    *   **Tonsuring:** Compulsory shaving of head.
    *   **Forced Uniforms:** Wearing uniforms is not mandatory.
    *   **ECT:** Direct [[Electroconvulsive Therapy]] (without anesthesia/muscle relaxant) is banned. ECT is banned for minors.
*   **Guidelines for Restraint (Section 97):**
    *   Used only to prevent **imminent harm** to self or others.
    *   Only when other less restrictive methods fail.
    *   Must be authorized by a psychiatrist.
    *   documented in medical records (nature, timing, reason).

#### **B. Admission Procedures (Forms of Legal Detention)**
| Type of Admission | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Independent Admission** | Formerly "Voluntary". Patient admits self. Must have capacity to make decisions. |
| **Supported Admission** | Formerly "Involuntary". Used for patients with high support needs. Requires application by **Nominated Representative (NR)** and examination by 2 psychiatrists. |
| **Emergency Treatment** | Any RMP can treat/restrain up to **72 hours** if there is an imminent threat to life/property, then transfer to a psychiatric establishment. |

#### **C. Reception Order (Historical Context - MHA 1987)**
*Older exams may still reference these:*
*   **Reception Order on Application:** By relative + 2 medical certificates (one from Govt doctor) -> Magistrate -> Order valid for 30 days.
*   **Reception Order on Production:** Police arrest wandering/dangerous mentally ill person -> Produce before Magistrate -> Medical Exam -> Reception Order.

### **4. Medicolegal Aspects**

1.  **Informed Consent:** Generally required. Exceptions involve emergencies (Doctrine of Necessity) or Supported Admissions where capacity is impaired.
2.  **False Imprisonment:** Unjustified restraint constitutes the tort of false imprisonment (Civil) or wrongful confinement (Criminal - Sec 127 [[Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita]] / Sec 340 IPC).
3.  **Documentation:** The "Golden Rule". If the reason for restraint and the monitoring log are not documented, the doctor is liable for negligence/assault.
4.  **Civil Rights:** The insane person retains rights to property management (Court appoints Manager) and personal affairs (Court appoints Guardian) if declared incapable.
5.  **Testamentary Capacity:** A mentally ill person can make a valid [[Will]] during a **Lucid Interval** (period of sanity).

### **5. Complications of Restraint**

*   **Physical:**
    *   [[Positional Asphyxia]]: Death due to inability to breathe in a specific position (usually prone + pressure on chest).
    *   **Aspiration Pneumonia:** If restrained flat on back while vomiting.
    *   **Rhabdomyolysis:** Muscle breakdown due to extreme struggling against bonds.
    *   **Fractures/Dislocations:** Especially in elderly or fragile patients.
    *   **Nerve compression injuries.**
*   **Psychological:** Increased trauma, humiliation, loss of trust in medical staff.

### **6. Autopsy Findings in Restraint-Related Death**

If a patient dies during or shortly after restraint (Custodial Death), look for:

*   **External:**
    *   **Abrasions/Contusions:** Around wrists, ankles (ligature marks).
    *   **Patterned Bruises:** Fingerprint bruises on arms (restraint by staff).
    *   **Oral Injuries:** Lacerations on lips/tongue (gagging or biting).
*   **Internal:**
    *   **Deep Muscle Bruising:** Dissection of limbs may reveal hematomas not seen externally.
    *   **Asphyxia Signs:** Petechial hemorrhages, cyanosis, visceral congestion.
    *   **Fractures:** Ribs (from chest compression), Hyoid/Thyroid cartilage (if neck holds were used).
*   **Toxicology:** Check for high levels of sedatives (chemical restraint) or illicit drugs (Excited Delirium).

### **7. Differentiating True vs. Feigned Insanity**

Often relevant when a criminal claims insanity to avoid restraint/punishment.

| Feature | True Insanity | Feigned Insanity (Malingering) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Onset** | Usually Gradual | Sudden |
| **Motive** | Usually Absent | Present (Avoid punishment) |
| **Symptoms** | Uniform, consistent with clinical syndrome | Exaggerated, erratic, convenient |
| **Facial Expression** | Vacant, fixed, rigid | Shifting, watchful |
| **Physical Toll** | Insomnia, anorexia, dry skin/lips | Sleeps well, eats well when unobserved |
| **Exertion** | Can withstand exhaustion for days | Tires easily, cannot sustain the "act" |
| **Reaction to Exam** | Indifferent | Resents examination |

> **Mnemonic for Feigned Insanity: ACTOR**
> *   **A** - **A**voids eye contact / examination
> *   **C** - **C**ontradictory symptoms
> *   **T** - **T**ires easily
> *   **O** - **O**veracting
> *   **R** - **R**ecent/Sudden onset
