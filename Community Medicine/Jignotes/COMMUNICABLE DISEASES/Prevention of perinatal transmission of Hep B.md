# Prevention of Perinatal Transmission of Hepatitis B

Perinatal transmission (Mother-to-Child Transmission) is a major source of chronic liver disease. Without intervention, approximately **90%** of infants infected by their mothers become **chronic carriers** because their immature immunological system is unable to clear the virus.

### 1. Magnitude of Risk
The risk of transmission depends heavily on the presence of the **e antigen** ([[HBeAg]]) in the mother, which indicates active viral replication.
*   **HBsAg positive + HBeAg positive:** Risk of transmission is **~90%**.
*   **HBsAg positive + HBeAg negative:** Risk of transmission is **~20%**.

### 2. Screening Strategies
*   **Universal Screening:** All pregnant women should be screened for [[Hepatitis B surface antigen]] (HBsAg) as part of routine antenatal care.
*   **Target Group:** If universal screening is not possible, high-risk groups (e.g., history of multiple blood transfusions, spouses of infected persons) must be screened.

### 3. Immunoprophylaxis (The Gold Standard)
The most effective strategy is **Passive-Active Immunization**. This combined procedure is ideal for preventing the carrier state in newborn babies of carrier mothers.

**A. Active Immunization ([[Hepatitis B Vaccine]])**
*   **Type:** Recombinant DNA vaccine.
*   **Timing:** The **Birth Dose** (Zero dose) must be given **within 24 hours** of birth.
    *   *Note:* If the birth dose is missed within 24 hours, it should still be given as early as possible, though efficacy decreases.
*   **Dosage:** 0.5 ml.
*   **Route:** Intramuscular (IM).
*   **Site:** **Anterolateral aspect of the mid-thigh** (Vastus Lateralis muscle),.

**B. Passive Immunization ([[Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin]] - HBIG)**
*   **Purpose:** Provides immediate, temporary protection (passive immunity).
*   **Timing:** Administer as soon as possible after birth, ideally **within 12 hours** (and not later than 48-72 hours).
*   **Dose:** 0.5 ml intramuscularly,.
*   **Site:** Different site from the vaccine (usually the opposite thigh) to prevent interference.

**C. The Combined Schedule**
Simultaneous administration of HBIG and Vaccine is more efficacious than HBIG alone.

| Component | Dose | Route | Site | Timing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hep B Vaccine** | 0.5 ml | IM | Left Thigh (Anterolateral) | Within 24 hours of birth |
| **HBIG** | 0.5 ml | IM | Right Thigh (Anterolateral) | Within 12-24 hours of birth |

**Follow-up Schedule:**
The birth dose should be followed by the complete primary immunization series:
1.  **Birth:** HBIG + Hep B Vaccine (0 dose).
2.  **6 Weeks:** 1st Dose (often part of [[Pentavalent vaccine]]).
3.  **10 Weeks:** 2nd Dose.
4.  **14 Weeks:** 3rd Dose.

> **Clinical Relevance:** Even if HBIG is not available, the **Birth Dose of the vaccine** alone prevents 70-95% of infections and must never be delayed.

### 4. Breastfeeding Guidelines
*   **Is it safe?** Yes.
*   **Recommendation:** Breastfeeding is **not contraindicated** in infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers.
*   There is no need to delay breastfeeding until the infant is fully immunized, provided the infant receives the recommended prophylaxis (Vaccine + HBIG) at birth.

### 5. Management of the Mother
*   Pregnant women with high viral loads (>1000 RNA copies/ml) may require antiviral therapy (e.g., Tenofovir) in the third trimester to further reduce viral load and transmission risk, although standard prevention relies heavily on the infant's prophylaxis.
*   **Universal Precautions:** Use disposable syringes, sterile instruments, and safe disposal of sharps during delivery.

### 6. Mnemonics for Exam

**Mnemonic for Hepatitis B Antigens & Transmission Risk:**
**"S E C"**
*   **S**urface antigen (HBsAg) = **S**creening (First to appear)
*   **E**nvelope antigen (HBeAg) = **E**xtremely infectious (**E**xplosive replication)
*   **C**ore antibody (Anti-HBc) = **C**aught it (Past or current infection)

**Mnemonic for Prevention:**
**"B-B-B"**
*   **B**lood screening (Antenatal)
*   **B**irth Dose (Vaccine) within 24 hours
*   **B**odyguard (HBIG) for babies of positive moms
