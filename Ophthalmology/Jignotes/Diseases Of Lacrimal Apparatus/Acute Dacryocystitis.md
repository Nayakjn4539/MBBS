# Acute Dacryocystitis

**Definition**
[[Acute Dacryocystitis]] is an acute suppurative inflammation of the [[lacrimal sac]]. It is characterized by the presence of a painful swelling in the region of the sac.

### Etiology and Pathogenesis
**Modes of Development**
1.  **Acute exacerbation of Chronic Dacryocystitis:** This is the most common mode.
2.  **Acute Peridacryocystitis:** Direct involvement from neighboring infected structures such as:
    *   [[Paranasal sinuses]]
    *   Surrounding bones
    *   [[Dental abscess]] or caries teeth in the upper jaw.

**Causative Organisms**
*   **Most Common:** [[Staphylococcus aureus]].
*   **Other agents:** [[Streptococcus haemolyticus]], [[Pneumococcus]] (Streptococcus pneumoniae).

### Clinical Features
The clinical course is divided into three progressive stages:

#### 1. Stage of Cellulitis
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Severe pain and tenderness in the area of the lacrimal sac (below the [[medial canthus]]).
    *   [[Epiphora]] (watering).
    *   Constitutional symptoms: Fever and malaise.
*   **Signs:**
    *   Red, hot, firm, and tender swelling at the medial canthus.
    *   Redness and edema spread to the eyelids and cheek.

#### 2. Stage of Lacrimal Abscess
*   **Mechanism:** Continued inflammation causes occlusion of the [[canaliculi]] due to edema. The sac fills with pus and distends.
*   **Rupture:** The anterior wall ruptures, forming a pericystic swelling.
*   **Signs:**
    *   Large **fluctuant** swelling (abscess).
    *   **Location:** The abscess usually points **below and to the outer side** of the sac.
    *   **Reason for location:** Due to gravitation of pus and the presence of the [[medial palpebral ligament]] in the upper part, which directs the pus downwards.

#### 3. Stage of Fistula Formation
*   If the [[lacrimal abscess]] is left unattended, it discharges spontaneously.
*   **External Fistula:** Leaves a fistula below the [[medial palpebral ligament]].
*   **Internal Fistula:** Rarely, the abscess may open into the nasal cavity.

### Complications
If not treated promptly, infection may spread, leading to:
*   **Ocular:** Acute [[conjunctivitis]], conversion of corneal abrasion into [[corneal ulcer]].
*   **Local:** [[Lid abscess]], [[Osteomyelitis]] of the [[lacrimal bone]], Facial cellulitis, Acute ethmoiditis.
*   **Orbital:** [[Orbital cellulitis]].
*   **Intracranial/Systemic (Rare):** [[Cavernous sinus thrombosis]], Generalized septicemia/meningitis.

> **Clinical Implication:** Due to the risk of [[Cavernous sinus thrombosis]] via the angular vein, manipulation of the area should be gentle, and systemic antibiotics are crucial.

### Treatment

**1. General & Medical Management (Cellulitis Stage)**
*   **Systemic Antibiotics:** To control infection (e.g., Oral or IV depending on severity).
*   **Analgesics & Anti-inflammatory drugs:** To relieve pain and swelling.
*   **Hot Fomentation:** To localize the infection and relieve pain.

**2. Management of Lacrimal Abscess**
*   **Incision and Drainage (I&D):**
    *   Indicated when pus starts pointing on the skin.
    *   A small incision is made.
    *   Pus is gently squeezed out.
    *   Dressing with [[betadine]] soaked roll gauze.

**3. Management of Lacrimal Fistula**
*   Control acute infection with systemic antibiotics.
*   **Fistulectomy:** Excision of the fistulous tract usually combined with DCT or DCR.

**4. Definitive Surgical Management**
Once the acute stage subsides and infection is controlled, definitive surgery is required to treat the underlying obstruction (usually NLD block):
*   **[[Dacryocystorhinostomy]] (DCR):** Operation of choice (creates a passage between the sac and the nose).
*   **[[Dacryocystectomy]] (DCT):** Removal of the sac (indicated if DCR is contraindicated or the sac is fibrosed).
