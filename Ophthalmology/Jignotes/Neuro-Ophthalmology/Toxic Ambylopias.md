# Toxic Amblyopias (Toxic Optic Neuropathies)

**Toxic Amblyopia** is a descriptive term for visual loss secondary to optic nerve damage caused by various drugs, toxins, or nutritional deficiencies. It is technically a [[Toxic Optic Neuropathy]]. The condition typically presents as a chronic retrobulbar neuritis.

### Aetiopathogenesis
The underlying mechanism usually involves metabolic disturbances affecting the **mitochondria** (oxidative phosphorylation defect) within the axons of the [[Optic Nerve]].
*   **Mechanism:** Interference with axoplasmic transport and mitochondrial function leads to decreased ATP production.
*   **Target:** The **[[Papillomacular Bundle]]** is most susceptible due to its high metabolic demand, leading to central or centrocecal field defects.

---

### General Clinical Features
Most toxic neuropathies share a common clinical profile (except acute poisons like Methanol):
*   **Onset:** Insidious, gradual, and progressive.
*   **Laterality:** Bilateral and symmetrical.
*   **Pain:** Painless visual loss (unlike [[Optic Neuritis]]).
*   **Color Vision:** **Dyschromatopsia** (loss of color vision) often precedes visual acuity loss. Usually a **Red-Green defect**.
*   **Visual Field:** Central or [[Centrocecal Scotoma]],.
*   **Fundus:**
    *   **Early:** Normal optic disc (Retrobulbar involvement) or slight temporal pallor.
    *   **Late:** [[Primary Optic Atrophy]] (Temporal pallor or diffuse).

> **Clinical Implication:** Always suspect toxic/nutritional neuropathy in a patient with bilateral, painless, progressive visual loss with central scotomas and temporal disc pallor.

### Specific Toxic Amblyopias

#### 1. Tobacco-Alcohol Amblyopia (Nutritional Optic Neuropathy)
This is the most common form, often associated with chronic alcoholism and heavy pipe/cigar smoking.
*   **Etiology:**
    *   **Tobacco:** Contains cyanide. Detoxification requires sulfur (from diet), which is deficient in alcoholics. Cyanide accumulates and damages ganglion cells.
    *   **Alcohol:** Causes Vitamin B12 and Folate deficiency due to poor absorption and dietary neglect.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   "Fogginess" of vision, difficulty reading.
    *   **[[Centrocecal Scotoma]]:** A defect extending from the fixation point to the blind spot.
    *   **[[Temporal Pallor]]:** Of the optic disc in late stages.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Cessation of smoking and alcohol.
    *   **[[Hydroxycobalamin]]** injections (1000 mcg weekly for 10 weeks),.

#### 2. Methyl Alcohol (Methanol) Amblyopia
Also known as "Wood Alcohol" poisoning. Occurs due to consumption of adulterated liquor or industrial solvents.
*   **Pathogenesis:** Methanol is metabolized by the liver into **Formaldehyde** and **Formic acid**. These cause severe metabolic acidosis and histotoxic anoxia of retinal ganglion cells,.
*   **Clinical Presentation (Acute):**
    *   Nausea, vomiting, headache, delirium, coma.
    *   **Visual symptoms:** Profound, sudden visual loss (within 18–48 hours).
    *   **Signs:** Dilated, fixed pupils and **[[Disc Edema]]** followed by rapid optic atrophy.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Gastric Lavage**.
    *   **Alkali therapy:** To correct metabolic acidosis (Sodium Bicarbonate).
    *   **Ethanol:** Competes with methanol for alcohol dehydrogenase, preventing formation of formic acid.
    *   **Hemodialysis:** To remove methanol and formate.

#### 3. Ethambutol Toxicity
An anti-tubercular drug causing dose-dependent optic neuropathy.
*   **Risk Factors:**
    *   Daily dose **>15 mg/kg**.
    *   Renal impairment (poor excretion).
    *   Diabetes or Alcoholism.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Retrobulbar neuritis type picture.
    *   **Red-Green color defect** (often the earliest sign).
    *   **Visual Field:** Central scotoma or sometimes bitemporal hemianopia due to chiasmal involvement.
*   **Management:**
    *   Stop the drug immediately.
    *   Recovery is usually good if detected early, but optic atrophy may occur if continued.
    *   **Screening:** Monthly checks of visual acuity and color vision for high-dose patients.

#### 4. Quinine Amblyopia
Used for malaria and leg cramps. Toxicity leads to direct toxicity to ganglion cells and vascular constriction.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Sudden total blindness.
    *   Associated **deafness and tinnitus**.
*   **Fundus Findings:**
    *   **Extreme arteriolar attenuation:** Retinal vessels become thread-like (classic sign),.
    *   Pale optic disc (Consecutive [[Optic Atrophy]]).
*   **Visual Field:** If vision recovers, the patient is often left with **[[Tubular Vision]]** (constricted fields).

#### 5. Chloroquine / Hydroxychloroquine
Used for malaria and autoimmune diseases (RA, SLE).
*   **Effect:** Primarily causes **[[Bull's Eye Maculopathy]]** (Retinotoxicity), but can also cause optic neuritis,.
*   **Sign:** Central scotoma, color vision defects.
*   **Screening:** Amsler grid, Automated Perimetry (10-2), OCT, and Fundus Autofluorescence.

#### 6. Amiodarone
Anti-arrhythmic drug.
*   **Presentation:** Insidious onset.
*   **Fundus:** Bilateral **[[Disc Edema]]** which mimics Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy ([[NAION]]).
*   **Note:** Also causes **[[Vortex Keratopathy]]** (Cornea Verticillata).

3.  **VEP (Visual Evoked Potential):** Shows reduced amplitude or prolonged latency.
4.  **Blood Levels:** B12, Folate, Lead levels, or Red cell folate.
5.  **Neuroimaging:** To rule out compressive lesions if the diagnosis is unclear.
