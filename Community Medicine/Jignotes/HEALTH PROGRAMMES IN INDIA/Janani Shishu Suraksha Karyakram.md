# [[HEALTH PROGRAMMES IN INDIA]] > Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram

### [[Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram]] (JSSK)

**Launch:** Launched on **1st June 2011** by the Government of India.
**Objective:** To provide **completely free and cashless services** to pregnant women and sick newborns/infants in public health institutions to eliminate [[Out-of-Pocket Expenditure]] (OOPE).

---

### Core Concept: The Shift in Strategy
Unlike [[Janani Suraksha Yojana]] (JSY) which is a *Conditional Cash Transfer* scheme, **JSSK** is an **Entitlement-based** initiative. It ensures that no money is spent by the family for delivery or treatment of a sick child in a government facility.

### Target Beneficiaries
1.  **Pregnant Women:** Delivering in public health institutions (including complications during ANC/PNC).
2.  **Sick Infants:** Originally for neonates (up to 30 days), now benefits are extended to **sick infants up to 1 year of age**.

---

### Key Entitlements
The initiative provides the following **Free Entitlements** to beneficiaries:

| **For Pregnant Women** | **For Sick Infants (upto 1 year)** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Free Delivery:** Including Caesarean Section. | **1. Free Treatment:** Zero expense treatment. |
| **2. Free Drugs & Consumables:** All medication required. | **2. Free Drugs & Consumables.** |
| **3. Free Diagnostics:** Essential lab tests and USG. | **3. Free Diagnostics.** |
| **4. Free Diet:** <br>• **3 days** for Normal Delivery<br>• **7 days** for C-Section | **4. Free Blood Transfusion** (if required). |
| **5. Free Blood:** Provision of blood if required. | **5. Free Transport:** Home to facility, between facilities, and drop back home. |
| **6. Free Transport:** <br>• Home to Health Institution<br>• Referral (Facility to Facility)<br>• **Drop Back Home** | **6. Exemption from User Charges:** No OPD/IPD fees. |

### Important Features
*   **Zero Expense:** Absolute focus on zero expenses for the family, covering even consumables like cotton, bandages, etc.
*   **Referral Transport:** A major gap addressed by JSSK is the assurance of free transport not just *to* the hospital, but also for **referrals** and **dropping back home**.
*   **Diet Provision:** Ensures nutritional support during the hospital stay to aid recovery and initiation of [[breastfeeding]].

---

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Reduction in MMR & IMR:** By removing financial barriers (transport cost, drug cost), it encourages **Institutional Deliveries** and timely treatment for sick infants, directly impacting [[Maternal Mortality Rate]] and [[Infant Mortality Rate]].
*   **Delayed Care Seeking:** It combats the delay in seeking care due to poverty, which is a significant cause of maternal and neonatal deaths.
