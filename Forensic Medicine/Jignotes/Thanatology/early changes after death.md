# [[Thanatology]] > early changes after death

### Early Changes After Death (Cellular Death)

Early postmortem changes usually commence after somatic death is complete and coincide with the phase of [[molecular death]] (cellular death). These changes generally occur between **12 to 24 hours** after death, though the timeline varies based on environmental factors.

### 1. Changes in the Eye
The eye undergoes rapid chemical and physical changes following the cessation of circulation and innervation.

*   **Corneal Changes:**
    *   **Loss of Reflex:** The corneal reflex is abolished immediately.
    *   **Opacity:** The cornea loses its luster and transparency. If eyelids are open, dust settles, and it becomes dry and hazy within a few hours. If eyelids are closed, it remains transparent for about 24 hours.
*   ** Intraocular Tension:**
    *   Rapid fall in tension. The eyeballs become flaccid and sink into the orbit.
*   **Pupils:**
    *   Initially dilate due to muscle relaxation, then constrict due to [[rigor mortis]] of the iris, and finally dilate during decomposition. They do not react to light.
*   **Retinal Changes:**
    *   **[[Kevorkian sign]] (Cattle-trucking):** Within minutes of death, the blood flow in retinal vessels becomes segmented or fragmented. The vessels look like a "truck and trailer" or "cattle-trucking".
    *   **Discoloration:** The retina becomes pale (first 2 hours). The optic disc outline becomes hazy (6–10 hours).
*   **[[Tache Noire]] de la Sclerotique:**
    *   If the eyelids remain open after death, two triangular, dry, yellow-brown or black spots appear on the sclera (white of the eye) at the medial and lateral sides of the cornea.
    *   **Mechanism:** Evaporation of fluid and deposition of dust/debris, leading to thinning of the sclera and visibility of the underlying choroid pigment.
*   **Chemical Changes:**
    *   **Vitreous Potassium:** There is a steady linear rise in potassium levels in the [[vitreous humor]] after death. This is independent of temperature and helps in estimating the [[Time Since Death]] (TSD).
    *   **Mnemonic:** **"Potassium Pours into the Pool"** (Intracellular K+ leaks into the vitreous fluid).

### 2. Algor Mortis (Cooling of the Body)
This is the cooling of the body to equilibrate with the environmental temperature.

*   **Mechanism:** Cessation of metabolic heat production while heat loss continues via conduction, convection, and radiation.
*   **Pattern:** It follows a **Sigmoid Curve** (Newton's Law of Cooling does not strictly apply initially).
    *   **Initial Plateau:** Temperature may not fall for the first 30–60 minutes (due to residual anaerobic glycolysis).
    *   **Linear Fall:** Rapid cooling occurs thereafter.
*   **Rate of Cooling:**
    *   Average rate: **0.5°C to 0.7°C per hour** in tropical climates.
    *   **Formula for TSD:**
        $$TSD (hours) = \frac{\text{Normal Body Temp} (98.6^\circ F) - \text{Rectal Temp}}{ \text{Rate of cooling}}$$
*   **Factors Affecting Cooling:**
    *   **Body Build:** Children and emaciated bodies cool faster (larger surface area to mass ratio). Obese bodies cool slower (fat acts as insulation).
    *   **Environment:** Cooling is faster in water and windy areas; slower in closed, humid rooms.
    *   **Clothing:** Clothes insulate and retard cooling.
*   **[[Postmortem Caloricity]]:** A condition where body temperature *rises* or remains high for the first 2 hours after death. Seen in:
    *   **S**trychnine poisoning.
    *   **T**etanus.
    *   **S**epticemia/Sunstroke.
    *   **P**ontine Hemorrhage.
    *   **Mnemonic:** **"Stop The Sun Stroke Please"**

### 3. Livor Mortis (Postmortem Staining/Hypostasis)
It is the bluish-purple discoloration of the skin in the dependent parts of the body due to the gravitation of blood into the capillaries and venules.

*   **Mechanism:** Cessation of circulation $\rightarrow$ Loss of vascular tone $\rightarrow$ Gravity pulls blood to dependent areas.
*   **Timeline:**
    *   **Starts:** 30 minutes to 1 hour.
    *   **Visible as patches:** 1–3 hours.
    *   **Coalesce/Uniform staining:** 4–6 hours.
    *   **Fixed:** 6–12 hours (does not blanch on pressure). *Fixation occurs due to hemolysis and staining of tissues.*
*   **[[Contact Pallor]]:** Pale areas within the lividity where the body was in contact with the ground or clothes (e.g., buttocks, scapula, calves). Pressure prevents capillaries from filling.
*   **Medicolegal Importance:**
    1.  **Sign of Death.**
    2.  **Time Since Death:** Assessed by fixation (blanching test).
    3.  **Position of Body:** If lividity is undisturbed, it indicates the position at death. If lividity and body position do not match, the body was moved.
    4.  **Cause of Death (Color):** The color of hypostasis can indicate specific poisons.

**Table: Color Variations in Livor Mortis**

| Condition/Poison | Color of Lividity |
| :--- | :--- |
| Normal | Bluish-Purple |
| [[Carbon Monoxide]] (CO) | **Cherry Red** |
| [[Cyanide]] (HCN) | **Bright Red / Brick Red** |
| Phosphorus | Dark Brown |
| Nitrites / Anilines / Chlorates | Chocolate Brown / Slate Grey |
| Cold/Refrigeration | Pink |
| Hydrogen Sulfide ($H_2S$) | Bluish-Green |
| Asphyxia | Dark Purple / Cyanotic |

*   **Autopsy Finding:** To differentiate **Livor Mortis (Hypostasis)** from **[[Bruise]] (Contusion)**:
    *   **Incision Test:** Make an incision into the discolored area.
    *   **Hypostasis:** Blood flows out from cut vessels; tissues can be washed clean.
    *   **Bruise:** Blood is extravasated into tissues (coagulated); tissues remain stained after washing.

### 4. Muscle Changes
The muscles go through three stages: Primary Flaccidity $\rightarrow$ Rigor Mortis $\rightarrow$ Secondary Flaccidity.

#### A. Primary Flaccidity
*   Occurs immediately after somatic death.
*   Muscles are relaxed, soft, and lose tone.
*   **Cause:** Loss of nerve supply, but muscles remain chemically alive (respond to electrical stimuli).

#### B. [[Rigor Mortis]] (Cadaveric Rigidity)
Stiffening and shortening of muscles (voluntary and involuntary) after death.

*   **Mechanism:**
    *   Depletion of **[[ATP]]** (Adenosine Triphosphate).
    *   Actin and Myosin filaments bind to form a rigid **Actomyosin** complex (permanent cross-bridges).
    *   Without ATP, the bond cannot break, leading to stiffness.
*   **Progression (Nysten's Law):**
    *   Starts in involuntary muscles (heart, diaphragm).
    *   Appears in voluntary muscles from **Head to Toe**: Eyelids $\rightarrow$ Jaw $\rightarrow$ Neck $\rightarrow$ Upper limbs $\rightarrow$ Trunk $\rightarrow$ Lower limbs.
    *   Disappears in the same order.
*   **Timeline (Rule of 12 for Tropical Climates):**
    *   **12 hours:** To appear and fully establish.
    *   **12 hours:** Stays fully developed.
    *   **12 hours:** To pass off (due to autolysis/decomposition).
*   **Factors Affecting Rigor Mortis:**
    *   **Age/Build:** Weak/Emaciated/Children/Old age $\rightarrow$ Rapid onset and short duration. Muscular/Healthy $\rightarrow$ Slow onset and long duration.
    *   **Cause of Death:** Exhausting diseases/Convulsions (Tetanus, Strychnine) $\rightarrow$ Very rapid onset (low ATP at death).
    *   **Temperature:** Heat accelerates it; Cold retards it.

#### C. [[Cadaveric Spasm]] (Instantaneous Rigor)
A rare form of muscle stiffening that occurs at the *moment of death*, bypassing primary flaccidity.

*   **Cause:** Severe mental tension, excitement, exhaustion, or fear at the moment of death.
*   **Key Feature:** Involves only a specific group of muscles (usually hands), not the whole body.
*   **Medicolegal Importance:** Indicates the **mode of death** (usually suicide or homicide) and the state of mind at death. Examples:
    *   Drowning victim grasping weeds (Alive when entering water).
    *   Suicide victim grasping the firearm firmly.
    *   Homicide victim grasping button/hair of assailant.

**Table: Rigor Mortis vs. Cadaveric Spasm**

| Feature | [[Rigor Mortis]] | [[Cadaveric Spasm]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Onset** | Delayed (1-2 hours) | Instantaneous (at moment of death) |
| **Muscles** | All muscles (Gradual) | Selected group (usually hands) |
| **Primary Flaccidity** | Present | Absent |
| **Predisposing Factor** | ATP Depletion | Emotional stress/Nervous tension |
| **Significance** | Time Since Death | Mode of Death (Suicide/Homicide) |
| **Mechanism** | Chemical change | Neurogenic/Unknown |

#### D. Other Stiffening Conditions
*   **Heat Stiffening:** Coagulation of muscle proteins when body is exposed to temperatures $>65^\circ C$ (e.g., burns). Muscles contract ("Pugilistic Attitude").
*   **Cold Stiffening:** Freezing of body fluids hardens the body. Reversible if thawed.
