### **Radiology of the Larynx**

Radiological imaging of the larynx plays a pivotal role in the assessment of trauma, foreign bodies, congenital anomalies, and malignancies. The choice of modality depends on the suspected pathology and the urgency of the clinical situation.

---

### **1. Plain Radiography (X-rays)**

Although advanced imaging has largely superseded plain films, they remain useful for initial screening, foreign body detection, and specific pediatric infections.

#### **A. Lateral Soft Tissue Neck View**
This is the most common screening view. It evaluates the air column from the nasopharynx to the subglottis.
*   **Technique:** Performed with the neck extended.
*   **Structures Visualized:**
    *   Base of tongue, [[Vallecula]], [[Epiglottis]], [[Aryepiglottic folds]], [[Arytenoids]].
    *   Air column of the larynx and trachea.
    *   [[Prevertebral soft tissue]] thickness.
    *   Hyaline cartilages ([[Thyroid cartilage]], [[Cricoid cartilage]], [[Arytenoid cartilage]]) which calcify after 25 years of age.

*   **Pathological Findings:**
    1.  **Foreign Bodies:**
        *   Radio-opaque objects (coins, bones) are visible.
        *   **Differential:** A flat object (like a coin) in the **trachea** appears **edge-on** in the PA view and flat in the lateral view (due to incomplete tracheal rings). In the **esophagus**, it appears flat in the PA view and edge-on in the lateral view.
    2.  **Acute Epiglottitis:**
        *   **Thumb Sign:** A swollen, enlarged epiglottis appearing like a thumb.
    3.  **Retropharyngeal Abscess:**
        *   Widening of the prevertebral soft tissue shadow (Normal: <7mm at C2, <22mm at C6 in adults).
        *   Loss of normal cervical spine curvature (straightening).
    4.  **Trauma:**
        *   Surgical emphysema (air in tissue planes).
        *   Hyoid bone fracture.
    5.  **Tumors:**
        *   Soft tissue mass displacing the air column.

#### **B. Anteroposterior (AP) View**
*   **Indications:** Assessment of subglottic airway and lateral displacement of the trachea.
*   **Pathological Findings:**
    *   **Steeple Sign:** Narrowing of the [[Subglottic lumen]] seen in [[Laryngotracheobronchitis]] (Croup). It resembles the steeple of a church.

#### **C. Chest X-ray (PA View)**
*   **Indications:**
    *   To rule out pulmonary metastasis in laryngeal carcinoma.
    *   To assess for synchronous primary tumors (bronchogenic carcinoma).
    *   To detect mediastinal widening or aspiration pneumonia.
    *   To look for air trapping (obstructive emphysema) in cases of bronchial foreign bodies.

**Clinical Implication:**
Calcification in laryngeal cartilages (post-puberty) can mimic foreign bodies. Always correlate with clinical history.
**Mnemonic:** **ACTH** – **A**rytenoid, **C**ricoid, **TH**yroid are **H**yaline cartilages (calcify). Epiglottis is elastic (does not calcify).

### **2. Computed Tomography (CT Scan)**

CT is the **investigation of choice** for laryngeal malignancies and trauma.

*   **Technique:** High-resolution CT (HRCT) with contrast, utilizing thin cuts (3mm through larynx, 5mm through neck).
*   **Indications:**
    1.  **Laryngeal Carcinoma Staging:**
        *   Assesses tumor size and extent.
        *   Evaluates **cartilage invasion** (sclerosis of arytenoid is suspicious).
        *   Determines involvement of [[Pre-epiglottic space]] and [[Paraglottic space]].
        *   Assesses subglottic extension and cervical lymph node status.
    2.  **Laryngeal Trauma:**
        *   Detects fractures of the thyroid and cricoid cartilages.
        *   Visualizes laryngeal derangement and hematomas.
    3.  **Chronic Stenosis:**
        *   Evaluates the length and thickness of stenotic segments.
    4.  **Deep Neck Infections:**
        *   Differentiates abscess (rim-enhancing collection) from cellulitis.

**Specific Signs on CT:**
*   **Chondrosarcoma:** Shows characteristic "popcorn-like" chondroid calcification with bone destruction.
*   **Laryngocele:** Fluid or air-filled sac communicating with the ventricle.

### **3. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**

MRI is superior for soft tissue contrast but is less effective for imaging cortical bone/calcification.

*   **Advantages:**
    *   No ionizing radiation (safe for children/pregnant women).
    *   **Superior Soft Tissue Definition:** Better visualization of the tongue base, pre-epiglottic space, and paraglottic space.
    *   **Cartilage Invasion:** More sensitive than CT for detecting *early* cartilage invasion.
    *   Multiplanar capability (Sagittal view helps assess superior/inferior tumor extent).

*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   Longer scan time (motion artifact from swallowing/breathing).
    *   Costly and less available.

---

### **4. Ultrasound**

Ultrasound has limited utility for intralaryngeal pathology due to the shielding effect of the cartilaginous framework (which reflects sound waves).

*   **Indications:**
    1.  **Neck Masses:** Evaluation of [[Cervical lymphadenopathy]], thyroid nodules, and cysts.
    2.  **Pediatrics:** Assessing vocal cord mobility in children where fiberoptic visualization is difficult.
    3.  **Intervention:** Guiding Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) of neck nodes.

---

### **5. Positron Emission Tomography (PET-CT)**

*   **Principle:** Uses glucose metabolism (FDG uptake) to identify malignant cells.
*   **Indications:**
    *   **Recurrence:** Distinguishing post-radiation scarring/edema (low uptake) from recurrent tumor (high uptake).
    *   **Occult Primary:** Finding the primary tumor in cases of neck metastasis with unknown origin.
    *   **Distant Metastasis:** Screening for spread to lungs or bones.

---

### **6. Fluoroscopy and Contrast Studies**

*   **Barium Swallow:**
    *   Used to evaluate **dysphagia** and aspiration.
    *   Identifies pharyngeal pouches (Zenker's), strictures, and extrinsic compression.
    *   **Videofluoroscopy (Modified Barium Swallow):**
        *   Assesses the dynamic swallowing phase.
        *   Detects aspiration and coordination of the swallow reflex.
        *   Useful for demonstrating [[Tracheomalacia]].

*   **Laryngography:**
    *   (Historically used, now largely replaced by CT/MRI). Involved coating the larynx with contrast to visualize surface anatomy.
