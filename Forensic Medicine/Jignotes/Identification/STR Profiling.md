# [[Identification]] > STR Profiling

### STR Profiling (Short Tandem Repeat Profiling)

**STR Profiling** is currently the gold standard method for [[DNA Profiling]] in forensic medicine. It utilizes specific regions of DNA that are highly variable among individuals to establish identification.

### 1. Definition and Structure
*   **STRs (Microsatellites):** These are short sequences of DNA, typically **2 to 7 base pairs** in length, that are repeated numerous times in a head-to-tail manner.
*   **Location:** They are found in the non-coding regions (introns or "junk DNA") of the nuclear DNA.
*   **Polymorphism:** The number of repeat units varies significantly between individuals (e.g., Person A has 7 repeats, Person B has 12 repeats at the same locus).
*   **Most Common:** Tetranucleotide repeats (4 base pairs, e.g., GATA-GATA-GATA) are most commonly used in forensics because they are less prone to technical artifacts like "stutter."

### 2. The Principle
*   While a single STR locus might be shared by 5–20% of the population, the probability of two unrelated individuals having the exact same number of repeats at **multiple loci** (e.g., 13, 15, or more) is astronomically low (1 in billions).
*   This unique combination constitutes the genetic fingerprint.

### 3. Procedure of STR Analysis
The process relies on [[Polymerase Chain Reaction]] (PCR) technology.

1.  **DNA Extraction:** DNA is isolated from the biological sample (blood, semen, hair root, bone).
2.  **Quantitation:** Determining the amount of human DNA present.
3.  **Amplification (PCR):** Specific primers are used to target the STR loci. The PCR process makes millions of copies of these specific regions. **Multiplexing** allows simultaneous amplification of many STR loci in a single tube.
4.  **Separation:** The amplified fragments are separated based on their length (size) using **Capillary Electrophoresis**.
5.  **Detection:** Laser detection identifies fluorescent tags attached to the DNA fragments.
6.  **Analysis:** Computer software generates an **Electropherogram** (a graph with peaks).

### 4. Interpretation of Results (Electropherogram)
The output consists of peaks on a graph.

| Result Type | Appearance on Graph | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Homozygous** | **One** tall peak at a specific locus | The individual inherited the *same* number of repeats from both parents (e.g., 7, 7). |
| **Heterozygous** | **Two** distinct peaks at a specific locus | The individual inherited a *different* number of repeats from each parent (e.g., 7, 9). |
| **Amelogenin** | Sex determination marker | **XX (Female):** One peak<br>**XY (Male):** Two distinct peaks. |

### 5. Advantages of STR Profiling
*   **High Sensitivity:** Can generate a profile from minute amounts of DNA (less than 1 nanogram). Useful for "touch DNA".
*   **Degraded Samples:** Since STR loci are very short, they can be successfully amplified even if the DNA is partially degraded (e.g., old bones, decomposed bodies). RFLP (older method) required intact long DNA strands.
*   **Discrimination Power:** High power of discrimination; probability of a random match is extremely low.
*   **Speed:** The process is rapid and can be automated.
*   **Databases:** Suitable for national DNA databases (e.g., CODIS) to link serial crimes.

### 6. Special Types of STRs

#### A. Y-STR Profiling
*   Targets STRs found only on the **Y-chromosome**.
*   **Inheritance:** Passed directly from father to son (Paternal lineage).
*   **Uses:**
    *   **Sexual Assault:** Best for separating male DNA from female DNA in mixed samples (e.g., vaginal swabs with low sperm count).
    *   **Paternity:** Tracing male lineage.
    *   **Azoospermia/Vasectomy:** Can detect male DNA even in the absence of sperm cells.

#### B. Mini-STRs
*   Primers are designed to target even smaller amplicons.
*   **Use:** Highly degraded DNA samples (e.g., mass disasters like World Trade Center identification).

### 7. Medicolegal Applications
1.  **Personal Identification:** Establishing identity of mutilated, decomposed, or skeletonized remains in mass disasters.
2.  **Paternity/Maternity Disputes:** Resolving disputes regarding parentage.
3.  **Criminal Justice:** Linking a suspect to a crime scene (blood, hair, saliva) or excluding an innocent suspect.
4.  **Sexual Offences:** Identifying the assailant through semen, saliva, or skin cells found on the victim.
5.  **Immigration Cases:** Establishing biological relationships.

### Mnemonic for Advantages of STR
**"STR-ONG"**
*   **S**mall samples (Sensitivity)
*   **T**olerates degradation (Works on old/rotten samples)
*   **R**apid and Automated
*   **O**ptimized via **PCR**
*   **N**umerous loci (Multiplexing)
*   **G**reat discrimination power
