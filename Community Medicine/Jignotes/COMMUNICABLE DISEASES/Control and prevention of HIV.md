# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Control and prevention of HIV

### **Control and Prevention of HIV/AIDS**

The control of [[HIV/AIDS]] requires a multi-pronged approach combining biomedical, behavioral, and structural interventions. The strategy focuses on interrupting transmission, strengthening host defenses, and managing existing cases to reduce the viral load in the community.

---

### **1. Modes of Prevention (Breaking the Chain of Transmission)**

#### **A. Sexual Transmission (87% of cases in India)**
*   **Education:** Promoting "Safer Sex" practices.
    *   **ABC Strategy:** **A**bstinence, **B**e Faithful, **C**ondom use.
*   **Barrier Methods:** Consistent and correct use of **Condoms** (Male and Female).
    *   *Clinical Relevance:* Condoms reduce the risk of heterosexual transmission by at least 80%.
*   **STI Control:** Early diagnosis and treatment of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) is crucial because the presence of an STI increases HIV transmission risk by 8–10 times.
*   **Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC):** Reduces female-to-male sexual transmission by approximately 60%.

#### **B. Blood-Borne Transmission**
*   **Blood Safety:** Mandatory screening of every unit of blood for HIV-1 and HIV-2, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Malaria, and Syphilis before transfusion.
*   **Rational Use:** Encouraging voluntary blood donation and avoiding professional donors.
*   **Injection Safety:** Use of **Auto-Disable (AD) syringes** and proper disposal of sharps.
*   **Harm Reduction:** For [[Injecting Drug Users (IDUs)]]:
    *   **Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST)** (e.g., Methadone, Buprenorphine).
    *   **Needle and Syringe Exchange Programmes (NSEP)**.

#### **C. Vertical Transmission (Parent-to-Child)**
*   **Prevention of Parent-to-Child Transmission ([[PPTCT]]):**
    *   **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART):** Life-long ART (Triple drug regimen: Tenofovir + Lamivudine + Efavirenz/Dolutegravir) for all pregnant and breastfeeding women regardless of CD4 count,.
    *   **Infant Prophylaxis:** Syrup **Nevirapine (NVP)** given to the newborn from birth up to a minimum of 6 weeks.
    *   **Safe Delivery:** Promoting institutional deliveries.
    *   **Feeding:** Counselling on exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months (preferred in developing countries) vs. replacement feeding (only if AFASS criteria—Acceptable, Feasible, Affordable, Sustainable, Safe—are met).

### **2. Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) as Prevention**

The concept is **"Treatment as Prevention" (TasP)**. Suppressing the viral load in an infected person makes them less likely to transmit the virus.

*   **Test and Treat Policy:** All people living with HIV (PLHIV) are initiated on ART regardless of CD4 count or clinical stage.
*   **Preferred First-Line Regimen (Adults):** **TLD**
    *   **T**enofovir (TDF)
    *   **L**amivudine (3TC)
    *   **D**olutegravir (DTG) – (Fixed Dose Combination, single pill, once daily).
*   **Goal:** To achieve **Viral Suppression** (Undetectable = Untransmittable).

### **3. Specific Prophylaxis**

#### **A. Post-Exposure Prophylaxis ([[PEP]])**
Used for accidental exposure (e.g., needle stick injury in healthcare workers or sexual assault).
*   **Timing:** Must be started as soon as possible, ideally within **2 hours**, and **not later than 72 hours**.
*   **Regimen:**
    *   **Adults:** Tenofovir (TDF) + Lamivudine (3TC) + Dolutegravir (DTG) (or Raltegravir).
    *   **Duration:** 28 days.
*   **Baseline Testing:** HIV testing of the exposed person is done immediately (to rule out pre-existing infection). Follow-up testing at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months.

#### **B. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis ([[PrEP]])**
*   **Target:** High-risk HIV-negative individuals (e.g., serodiscordant couples, MSM, FSW).
*   **Regimen:** Daily oral Tenofovir + Emtricitabine (or Lamivudine).
*   **Efficacy:** >90% effective in preventing sexual transmission if adherence is high.

#### **C. Co-trimoxazole Prophylaxis Therapy (CPT)**
*   **Indication:** To prevent opportunistic infections (OIs) like *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia (PCP) and Toxoplasmosis.
*   **Criteria:** Started when CD4 count is **< 350 cells/mm³** or WHO Clinical Stage 3 or 4.

### **4. National AIDS Control Programme ([[NACP]]) Strategies**

The NACP (Phase IV and V) in India operates under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare via **NACO** (National AIDS Control Organization).

| Strategy Component | Key Activities |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres ([[ICTC]])** | • Hub for diagnosis.<br>• **The 5 C's of Testing:** Consent, Confidentiality, Counselling, Correct Test Results, Connection to care.<br>• Uses **Opt-out** strategy in clinical settings (e.g., ANC clinics). |
| **Targeted Interventions ([[TI]])** | • Focuses on **High-Risk Groups (HRGs):** Female Sex Workers (FSW), Men who have Sex with Men (MSM), Transgenders, Injecting Drug Users (IDU).<br>• Focuses on **Bridge Populations:** Truckers, Migrants. |
| **Link Worker Scheme** | • Community-based outreach to address needs of HRGs and vulnerable populations in rural areas. |
| **Condom Promotion** | • Social marketing and free distribution.<br>• Addressing "Condom Fatigue". |
| **IEC/BCC** | • **Information, Education, Communication:** Reducing stigma, promoting safe behavior.<br>• **Red Ribbon Express:** Train traversing India to spread awareness. |
| **HIV-TB Coordination** | • **Bidirectional Screening:** All TB patients tested for HIV; all HIV patients screened for TB.<br>• **CBNAAT:** Upfront diagnostic tool for TB in PLHIV. |

### **5. Global and National Targets**

To end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030, the **95-95-95 Targets** (by 2025) are:
1.  **95%** of all people living with HIV will **know their HIV status**.
2.  **95%** of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will **receive sustained ART**.
3.  **95%** of all people receiving ART will have **viral suppression**.

> *   **S**afe practices (Sex, Needles, Blood)
> *   **A**vailable Medications (ART, PEP, PrEP)
> *   **V**oluntary Counselling & Testing (VCT/ICTC)
> *   **E**mpowerment & Education
