# [[Identification]] > Race from skeletal remains

### Determination of Race from Skeletal Remains

Determination of [[Race]] (ancestry) from skeletal remains is a complex aspect of [[Forensic Anthropology]]. It is generally less reliable than sex or age estimation due to extensive intermixing of populations. However, the **skull** is the most reliable bone for this purpose (accuracy approx. 90%), followed by the **long bones**.

The three major broad racial groups historically classified in forensic osteology are:
1.  **Caucasoid** (Europeans, Indians)
2.  **Negroid** (Africans)
3.  **Mongoloid** (Asiatics, Orientals)

---

### 1. Determination from Skull ([[Cephalic Index]])

The primary method for determining race from the skull is utilizing the **Cephalic Index (C.I.)**.

**Formula:**
$$Cephalic Index = \frac{\text{Maximum Breadth of Skull}}{\text{Maximum Length of Skull}} \times 100$$

*   **Maximum Breadth:** Biparietal diameter.
*   **Maximum Length:** From Glabella to Occipital protuberance.
*   Measured using a: **Spreading Caliper** or **Osteometric board**.

#### Classification Based on Cephalic Index

| Classification | C.I. Range | Skull Shape | Typical Race/Ethnicity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dolichocephalic** | **70 – 75** | Long Head | **Negroids**, Aborigines, Pure Aryans |
| **Mesaticephalic** | **75 – 80** | Medium Head | **Caucasoids** (Europeans, Indians, Chinese) |
| **Brachycephalic** | **80 – 85** | Short/Round Head | **Mongoloids** (Japanese) |

> **Note:** "Indians" are generally considered Mesaticephalic, while "Aryans" are classified as Dolichocephalic in forensic texts.

### 2. Morphological Features of the Skull

Apart from the Cephalic Index, specific anatomical features of the skull help differentiate races.

| Feature | **Caucasoid** (European/Indian) | **Negroid** (African) | **Mongoloid** (Asian) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **General Shape** | Mesaticephalic | Dolichocephalic | Brachycephalic |
| **Forehead** | Slightly sloping | Rounded/Vertical | Vertical |
| **Facial Profile** | Orthognathous (Straight/Flat) | Prognathous (Projecting jaws) | Flat / Dish-shaped |
| **Orbits** | Triangular / Sloping | Rectangular / Square | Rounded / Circular |
| **Nasal Aperture** | Narrow, Elongated | Broad, Wide (Gutteral) | Rounded |
| **Nasal Bridge** | High, Prominent | Low, Flat | Flat |
| **Cheek Bones** (Zygoma)| Receding / Compressed | Receding | **Prominent / Projecting** |
| **Palate** | Triangular / Narrow | Rectangular / Wide | Parabolic / Rounded |
| **Teeth** | Small, crowded | Large | **Shovel-shaped Incisors** |
| **Chin** | Prominent | Receding | Moderate |

#### Important Dental Features for Race
*   **Mongoloids:** Exhibit **Shovel-shaped incisors** (inner surface of upper incisors is scooped out).
*   **Caucasoids:** May show **Carabelli’s cusp** (an extra tubercle on the lingual surface of the upper first permanent molar).
*   **Negroids:** Generally have larger teeth and wider spacing.

**Mnemonic for Dental Features:** **PASTE**
*   **P**ointed canines
*   **A**bsence of molars
*   **S**hovel incisors (Mongoloid)
*   **T**aurodontism (Bull-like teeth)
*   **E**namel pearls

### 3. Determination from Long Bones (Indices)

The ratio of lengths of different long bones can provide clues to ancestry.

#### A. Brachial Index (Radio-Humeral Index)
*   **Formula:** $\frac{\text{Length of Radius}}{\text{Length of Humerus}} \times 100$
*   **Significance:** Compares the forearm to the upper arm.
*   **Negroids:** > 80 (Longer forearms relative to upper arm).
*   **Caucasoids:** ~ 75.
*   **Mongoloids:** ~ 70-75.

#### B. Crural Index (Tibio-Femoral Index)
*   **Formula:** $\frac{\text{Length of Tibia}}{\text{Length of Femur}} \times 100$
*   **Significance:** Compares the lower leg to the thigh.
*   **Negroids:** > 83 (Longer legs relative to thighs).
*   **Caucasoids:** < 83.

#### C. Humero-Femoral Index
*   **Formula:** $\frac{\text{Length of Humerus}}{\text{Length of Femur}} \times 100$
*   **Use:** To compare upper limb proportionality to lower limb.

#### D. Intermembral Index
*   **Formula:** $\frac{\text{Humerus + Radius}}{\text{Femur + Tibia}} \times 100$
*   **Significance:** Comparison of total upper limb length to total lower limb length.
*   **Negroids:** ~ 69.
*   **Caucasoids/Mongoloids:** ~ 72.

> **General Rule:** [[Negroid]] populations tend to have longer distal segments of limbs (radius/tibia) compared to proximal segments (humerus/femur).

### 4. Miscellaneous Findings (Non-Skeletal)

While not skeletal, hair found with remains can aid racial identification via cross-section:
*   **Mongoloid:** Circular cross-section (Straight hair).
*   **Caucasoid:** Oval cross-section (Wavy/Curly hair).
*   **Negroid:** Flat / Kidney-shaped cross-section (Kinky/Woolly hair).

---

### Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Limitations:** Pure races are rare due to global migration and intermixing. Therefore, these indices provide *probabilities* rather than absolute identification.
*   **Mass Disasters:** Helpful in narrowing down identification when victims of multiple nationalities are involved (e.g., plane crashes).
*   **Commingling:** In cases where bones are mixed, determining race can help segregate skeletons if the individuals were of different ancestries.
