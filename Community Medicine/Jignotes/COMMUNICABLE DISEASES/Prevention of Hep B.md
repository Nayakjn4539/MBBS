# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Prevention of Hep B

# Prevention of Hepatitis B

Prevention of [[Hepatitis B]] is a major public health priority because the disease can lead to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Prevention strategies rely heavily on immunization (active and passive) and general preventive measures to break the chain of transmission.

### 1. Active Immunization: [[Hepatitis B Vaccine]]

This is the most effective tool for prevention.

*   **Type of Vaccine:**
    *   Currently, **[[Recombinant DNA yeast-derived vaccine]]** is used,.
    *   It contains the **HBsAg** (Surface Antigen).
    *   It is a **killed/subunit vaccine** and is **non-infectious**.

*   **Storage:**
    *   Stored at **+2°C to +8°C** in the [[Ice Lined Refrigerator (ILR)]].
    *   It is **highly freeze-sensitive**. *Freezing destroys the potency by breaking the bond between the antigen and the alum adjuvant*. If frozen, it must be discarded.

*   **Administration:**
    *   **Route:** **Intramuscular (IM)**.
    *   **Site:**
        *   **Infants/Children < 2 years:** [[Anterolateral aspect of mid-thigh]] (Vastus Lateralis muscle),.
        *   **Adults:** Deltoid muscle.
        *   *Note:* Gluteal injection is avoided as fat deposition reduces seroconversion rates.

#### **Immunization Schedule**

| Category | Schedule | Dose | Remarks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Infants (India/UIP)** | **At Birth:** Within 24 hours (Zero dose)<br>**Primary:** 6, 10, 14 weeks | 0.5 ml | Birth dose prevents **[[Perinatal Transmission]]**. <br>Primary doses often given as **[[Pentavalent Vaccine]]** (DPT+HepB+Hib),. |
| **Adults** | 0, 1, and 6 months | 1.0 ml | 2nd dose 1 month after 1st.<br>3rd dose 6 months after 1st. |
| **Accelerated** | 0, 1, 2 months (Booster at 12 mo) | 1.0 ml | Used for rapid protection (travelers). |

*   **Protective Efficacy:**
    *   Induces protective antibody (**Anti-HBs**) levels in >95% of infants/children.
    *   Protective titre is defined as **Anti-HBs > 10 mIU/ml**.
    *   Protection is generally considered **lifelong**.

### 2. Passive Immunization: [[Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (HBIG)]]

HBIG provides *immediate, short-term protection* (lasting ~3 months).

*   **Indications:**
    1.  **Accidental Exposure:** Needle stick injuries, mucosal splash in non-immune persons.
    2.  **Newborns of Carrier Mothers:** Infants born to HBsAg+ mothers.
    3.  **Sexual Contacts:** Acute exposure to infected partners.
*   **Timing:** Must be given as soon as possible, ideally within **6 hours**, and not later than **48-72 hours**,.
*   **Dose:** 0.05 to 0.07 ml/kg body weight,.

### 3. Passive-Active Immunization

This involves the simultaneous administration of **HBIG** and **Hepatitis B Vaccine** at **different sites**,.

*   **Indication:**
    *   **Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP):** For needle stick injuries in unvaccinated individuals.
    *   **Perinatal Transmission Prevention:** Crucial for newborns of HBsAg positive mothers.
        *   HBIG (0.5 ml) + Hep B Vaccine (Birth dose) given within **24 hours** of birth.
        *   This combination reduces transmission risk by over 90%.

### 4. General Preventive Measures

These measures aim to interrupt the routes of transmission (Parenteral, Sexual, Vertical).

*   **Blood Safety:** Mandatory screening of all donated blood and blood products for **HBsAg**,. Encouraging voluntary blood donation over paid donors.
*   **Safe Injection Practices:**
    *   Use of **[[Auto-Disable (AD) Syringes]]** and disposable needles,.
    *   Proper sterilization of surgical and dental instruments.
    *   Avoid unnecessary injections.
*   **Lifestyle Measures:**
    *   Practice of safe sex (use of **condoms**).
    *   Avoid sharing razors, toothbrushes, or nail clippers.
*   **Health Education:** Awareness regarding modes of transmission and danger of the disease.

### 5. Management of Exposure (Needle Stick Injury)

If a healthcare worker (HCW) is exposed to HBsAg positive blood:

1.  **Wash** the area immediately with soap and water (do not scrub or squeeze).
2.  **Check HCW's Anti-HBs Titre:**
    *   **If Titre > 10 mIU/ml (Responder):** No action needed (already immune).
    *   **If Titre < 10 mIU/ml (Non-responder) or Unvaccinated:** Give **HBIG** immediately + Start **Vaccine series** (0, 1, 6 months),.

### Clinical Relevance
**[[Perinatal Transmission]]** is a major cause of the chronic carrier state. If a mother is HBeAg positive (marker of high infectivity), the risk of transmission to the newborn is **90%**. If she is only HBsAg positive (without HBeAg), the risk is **20%**. Therefore, the **Birth Dose** of the vaccine is critical to prevent the baby from becoming a chronic carrier,.

### Mnemonic
**"B-SAFE"** to prevent Hepatitis B:
*   **B**lood screening (HBsAg)
*   **S**afe sex / Syringes (Disposable)
*   **A**ctive Immunization (Vaccine 0, 1, 6)
*   **F**ast Passive Immunization (HBIG within 6-24 hrs)
*   **E**ducation (Health awareness)
