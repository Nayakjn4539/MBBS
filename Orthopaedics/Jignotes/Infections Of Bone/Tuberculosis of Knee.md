# [[Infections Of Bone]] > Tuberculosis of Knee

### Tuberculosis of the Knee

**Tuberculosis of the Knee** is the third most common site for [[skeletal tuberculosis]], following the [[spine]] and the [[hip joint]]. It accounts for approximately 10% of skeletal TB cases. The disease is invariably secondary to a primary focus elsewhere in the body (usually lungs or lymph nodes), spreading via the hematogenous route.

---

### Etiopathology and Pathogenesis

The infection usually begins in one of two sites:
1.  **Synovial Membrane (Synovial Tuberculosis):** More common. The bacilli lodge in the synovium, leading to [[synovitis]], hypertrophy, and effusion.
2.  **Osseous Focus (Osseous Tuberculosis):** Starts in the subchondral bone of the femoral or tibial condyles (metaphysis/epiphysis) or rarely the patella. From here, it spreads into the joint.

**Pathological Progression:**
*   **Synovial Hypertrophy:** The synovium becomes thickened, edematous, and grey, forming a **[[pannus]]**.
*   **Cartilage Destruction:** The pannus grows over and under the articular cartilage, destroying it (though slower than in [[pyogenic arthritis]]).
*   **Bone Erosion:** Denuded bone ends become raw and eroded.
*   **Ligamentous Laxity:** Destruction of cruciate ligaments and capsule leads to instability and subluxation.
*   **Fibrous Ankylosis:** Unlike septic arthritis which often leads to bony ankylosis, TB knee typically heals by [[fibrous ankylosis]].

### Clinical Features

The onset is insidious. It affects children and young adults most frequently.

#### Symptoms
*   **Pain:** Dull aching, often worse at night (**Night Cries** may be present, though less common than in [[TB Hip]]).
*   **Swelling:** Gradual onset, diffuse swelling.
*   **Limp:** Antalgic gait due to pain and deformity.
*   **Constitutional Symptoms:** Low-grade fever, weight loss, anorexia (present in ~20% of cases).

#### Signs
*   **Look:**
    *   **Swelling:** Diffuse swelling filling the parapatellar fossae (horseshoe-shaped if suprapatellar pouch involved).
    *   **Muscle Wasting:** Marked wasting of the [[quadriceps]] and calf muscles. The swelling combined with wasting gives the knee a **spindle-shaped appearance**.
    *   **Deformity:** Initially flexion; later, the characteristic [[Triple Deformity]] develops.
    *   **Sinus:** Discharging sinuses may be present in late stages.
*   **Feel:**
    *   **Temperature:** Local warmth (Calor) is usually present but mild (Cold inflammation).
    *   **Synovial Thickening:** A characteristic **"doughy"** feel of the thickened synovium is palpable.
    *   **Tenderness:** Diffuse tenderness along the joint line.
*   **Move:**
    *   Restricted range of motion (ROM) due to pain and muscle spasm. movements are painful.

### Triple Deformity of the Knee

In advanced stages of [[tuberculosis of the knee]], characteristic displacement of the tibia occurs in relation to the femur due to the destruction of ligaments (especially the [[anterior cruciate ligament]]) and the unbalanced pull of spastic muscles.

**Components of Triple Deformity:**
1.  **Flexion:** Due to spasm of the hamstring muscles.
2.  **Posterior Subluxation:** The tibia shifts backward (posteriorly) due to the pull of the hamstrings and gravity (when the patient lies supine with the knee flexed).
3.  **Lateral Rotation (External Rotation):** The tibia rotates externally due to the pull of the [[biceps femoris]] and the iliotibial band.

*(Note: Some sources also include **Abduction** of the tibia as a component of the deformity).*

**Pathomechanics:**
*   Destruction of the [[cruciate ligaments]] creates instability.
*   The **[[hamstrings]]** (acting as flexors) overpower the wasted quadriceps.
*   The **[[biceps femoris]]** (attached to the fibular head) pulls the tibia into external rotation and posterior subluxation.

### Investigations

1.  **Radiography (X-ray):**
    *   *Early Stage:* Soft tissue swelling, periarticular [[osteopenia]] (rarefaction), widening of joint space (due to effusion).
    *   *Late Stage:* Narrowing of joint space (cartilage destruction), marginal erosions (lytic lesions), subluxation (Triple deformity).
    *   *Sequelae:* Fibrous ankylosis, sometimes bony ankylosis (rare).

2.  **Blood Tests:**
    *   Elevated [[ESR]] and CRP (markers of inflammation).
    *   Lymphocytosis.

3.  **MRI:**
    *   Method of choice for early diagnosis. Shows synovial proliferation, effusion, marrow edema, and soft tissue extension (abscess).

4.  **Biopsy (Gold Standard):**
    *   **Synovial Biopsy:** Obtained via arthroscopy or mini-arthrotomy. Histopathology shows **caseating granulomas** with Langhans giant cells.
    *   **Culture:** For *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* and drug sensitivity testing.

### Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Key Differentiating Features |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Septic Arthritis]]** (Subacute) | More acute onset, higher fever, polymorphonuclear leukocytosis, aspiration yields frank pus. |
| **[[Rheumatoid Arthritis]]** (Monoarticular) | Usually polyarticular, RF positive, symmetric, morning stiffness. |
| **[[Hemophilic Arthritis]]** | History of bleeding disorder, hemarthrosis, squaring of patella on X-ray. |
| **Chronic Traumatic Synovitis** | History of significant trauma, improves with rest, no constitutional symptoms. |

### Treatment

The goal is to achieve a healed, painless, and stable joint with functional movement if possible, or a sound ankylosis in a functional position.

#### 1. Conservative Management
Indicated in early stages (Synovitis) without significant destruction.
*   **Anti-Tubercular Therapy (ATT):** Multidrug chemotherapy (Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol) for 12–18 months.
*   **Rest and Traction:** Skin traction (below knee) is applied to:
    *   Relieve muscle spasm and pain.
    *   Prevent joint surfaces from compressing.
    *   Correct flexion deformity.
    *   Prevent posterior subluxation.
*   **Mobilization:** Once acute symptoms subside (pain/spasm disappear), gradual active exercises are started. Weight-bearing is protected for 18–24 months.

#### 2. Surgical Management
Indicated for non-responsive cases, advanced disease, or deformity.

*   **Synovectomy and Debridement:**
    *   *Indication:* Synovial TB unresponsive to 6–12 weeks of conservative care; disease limited to synovium with preserved cartilage.
    *   *Procedure:* Removal of inflamed synovium and joint debridement. Can be done open or arthroscopically.

*   **Corrective Procedures for Deformity:**
    *   *Traction:* For correcting mild flexion deformities.
    *   *Soft Tissue Release:* For fixed flexion deformities.
    *   *Supracondylar Osteotomy:* For bony deformities.

*   **[[Arthrodesis]] (Joint Fusion):**
    *   *Indication:* Advanced arthritis with destroyed articular cartilage, painful fibrous ankylosis, or severe triple deformity.
    *   *Technique:* **[[Charnley's Compression Arthrodesis]]** is the popular method.
    *   *Position:* Knee fused in 5–10° flexion and neutral rotation.

*   **[[Total Knee Replacement]] (TKR):**
    *   *Indication:* Controversial. Considered in quiescent disease (healed for >10 years) with antibiotic cover, but carries a risk of reactivation.

#### Clinical Implication
*   **Triple deformity** is a sign of *neglected* or *advanced* TB knee. Early institution of traction prevents the tibia from sliding backward and rotating, thus preventing this disabling sequela.
