# [[Bone Tumors]] > Giant Cell Tumor

### **Giant Cell Tumor (Osteoclastoma)**

**Giant Cell Tumor (GCT)**, also known as [[Osteoclastoma]], is a distinct, locally aggressive neoplasm of the bone. It is generally classified as benign but has a significant tendency for local recurrence and a small potential for metastasis.

---

### **Epidemiology and Demographics**

*   **Incidence:** Accounts for approximately 5% of all bone tumors and 20% of benign bone tumors.
*   **Age:** Classically occurs between **20–40 years** of age. It is **rare** before skeletal maturity (before the epiphysis has fused).
*   **Sex:** Slight female preponderance (**Females > Males**; ratio approx 1.2:1 to 1.5:1).
*   **Origin:** Arises from the non-bone-forming connective tissue of the marrow.

---

### **Anatomical Location**

*   **Location in Bone:**
    *   **Epiphysio-metaphyseal:** It originates in the [[metaphysis]] and extends into the [[epiphysis]] after the growth plate has closed.
    *   It typically extends right up to the **subchondral bone plate** (articular cartilage), often bulging into the joint.
    *   **Eccentric:** Located off-center within the medullary canal.
*   **Common Sites:**
    1.  **Around the Knee (50%):** [[Distal Femur]] > [[Proximal Tibia]].
    2.  **Distal Radius:** Third most common site (and the most common tumor of the distal radius).
    3.  **Proximal Humerus.**
    4.  **Sacrum:** Most common site in the axial skeleton.

### **Pathology**

#### **Gross Appearance**
*   The tumor is soft, friable, and reddish-brown (fleshy) in color.
*   Areas of hemorrhage, cystic degeneration, and necrosis are common.
*   Often described as resembling "currant jelly" or fresh liver.

#### **Histopathology**
The tumor consists of two main cell populations:
1.  **Mononuclear Stromal Cells:** These are the **true neoplastic cells**. They are spindle-shaped or round, proliferating cells. They express [[RANK ligand]], which recruits and activates osteoclasts.
2.  **Multinucleated Giant Cells:** These are reactive (non-neoplastic), osteoclast-like cells containing 20–100 nuclei. They are responsible for bone resorption.

*   **Key Feature:** The nuclei of the giant cells look identical to the nuclei of the stromal cells.

**Histological Grading (Jaffe’s Grading):**
*   **Grade I (Benign):** Minimal stromal atypia, abundant giant cells.
*   **Grade II (Intermediate):** Moderate stromal atypia.
*   **Grade III (Malignant):** Severe stromal atypia, sarcomatous stroma, few giant cells.
*(Note: Histological grade does not always correlate well with clinical behavior).*

### **Clinical Features**

*   **Pain:** The most common symptom; usually dull, aching, and gradually increasing.
*   **Swelling:** A lump may be palpable at the bone end.
*   **Joint Symptoms:** Limitation of movement, stiffness, or effusion due to proximity to the joint.
*   **Pathological Fracture:** Occurs in 10–15% of cases due to cortical thinning.
*   **Egg-shell Crackling:** A clinical sign elicited on palpation due to the thinning of the expanded cortex.

---

### **Radiological Features (X-ray)**

The classic X-ray appearance is diagnostic in many cases.

*   **Location:** **Eccentric**, **Epiphyseal** (abutting articular cartilage).
*   **Osteolysis:** Purely lytic lesion (no bone formation within the tumor).
*   **Margins:** Well-defined but **non-sclerotic** margins (Grade I/II). Indistinct margins suggest aggressiveness.
*   **Expansion:** Expansile lesion causes ballooning of the cortex.
*   **Soap Bubble Appearance:** The tumor is traversed by bony trabeculae (remnants of the destroyed bone), giving a loculated or multiloculated "soap bubble" look.
*   **No Periosteal Reaction:** Unless a pathological fracture is present.

**Campanacci’s Radiological Grading:**
| Grade | Description | Clinical Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Grade 1** | Well-marginated, rim of sclerosis, cortex intact. | Latent/Inactive |
| **Grade 2** | Well-defined but no sclerotic rim; thinned/expanded cortex. | Active |
| **Grade 3** | Ill-defined borders, cortical destruction, soft tissue extension. | Aggressive |

### **Differential Diagnosis**

The mnemonic **BLUNACH** covers lesions containing giant cells:
*   **B** - [[Brown tumor]] (Hyperparathyroidism)
*   **L** - Location (Epiphyseal) helps distinguish GCT
*   **U** - [[Unicameral Bone Cyst]] (usually diaphyseal/metaphyseal)
*   **N** - [[Non-ossifying Fibroma]]
*   **A** - [[Aneurysmal Bone Cyst]] (ABC)
*   **C** - [[Chondroblastoma]] (Epiphyseal, but in skeletally *immature* patients)
*   **H** - [[Hyperparathyroidism]] / Histiocytoma

**Key Differentiator:**
*   **Chondroblastoma:** Epiphyseal, <20 years (open physis), punctate calcifications.
*   **GCT:** Epiphyseal, 20-40 years (closed physis), no calcification.
*   **ABC:** Metaphyseal, <20 years, fluid-fluid levels on MRI.

### **Treatment**

The goal is local control while preserving joint function.

#### **1. Conservative/Medical Management**
*   **Denosumab:** A monoclonal antibody against [[RANK ligand]]. It inhibits osteoclast maturation. Used for:
    *   Unresectable tumors (e.g., spine/sacrum).
    *   Neoadjuvant therapy to downstage a large tumor before surgery.
*   **Bisphosphonates:** May help reduce recurrence.

#### **2. Surgical Management**
*   **Extended Curettage (Treatment of Choice):**
    *   Creating a cortical window.
    *   Scraping out the tumor (curettage).
    *   **High-speed burring:** To remove microscopic disease from the cavity walls.
    *   **Adjuvants:** Application of **Chemical cauterization** (Phenol, Alcohol) or **Cryotherapy** (Liquid Nitrogen) to kill residual cells.
    *   **Filling the defect:**
        *   **Bone Cement ([[PMMA]]):** Thermal effect of cement also kills tumor cells; provides immediate stability.
        *   **Bone Graft:** Sandwich technique (Graft near joint, cement behind it).

*   **Wide Excision / Resection:**
    *   Indicated for Grade 3 tumors, massive destruction, or expendable bones (e.g., [[Proximal Fibula]], [[Distal Ulna]]).
    *   **Reconstruction** options after resection:
        *   **Arthrodesis** (Joint fusion).
        *   **Megaprosthesis** (Custom-made joint replacement).
        *   **Turn-o-plasty:** For distal femur tumors (rarely done now).

*   **Amputation:** Reserved for massive recurrences or malignant transformation with neurovascular involvement.

### **Complications and Prognosis**

1.  **Recurrence:** The most common complication.
    *   Occurs in **20–50%** of cases if simple curettage is done.
    *   Reduces to **<10-20%** with extended curettage + adjuvants (Phenol/Cement).
    *   Most recurrences happen within the first 2 years.
2.  **Malignant Transformation:** Rare (<5%), usually into [[Osteosarcoma]] or [[Fibrosarcoma]], often after radiation therapy.
3.  **Pulmonary Metastasis:** "Benign metastasis" occurs in 1-3% of cases. Usually indolent; treated by wedge resection.
