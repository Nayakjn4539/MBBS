# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Anti – rabies vaccine

### **Anti-Rabies Vaccine (ARV)**

**Anti-Rabies Vaccine** is an immunobiological substance used to prevent [[Rabies]], an acute, highly fatal viral disease of the CNS caused by [[Lyssavirus type 1]]. It is a unique vaccine because it is primarily used **after** exposure to the virus (Post-Exposure Prophylaxis) due to the long incubation period of the disease.

### **1. Types of Vaccines**
Currently, **Cell Culture and Embryonated Egg-based Vaccines (CCEEVs)** are recommended over the older nerve tissue vaccines (Semple) due to safety and potency.

*   **Human Diploid Cell Vaccine (HDCV)**
*   **Purified Chick Embryo Cell Vaccine (PCECV)** [e.g., Rabipur]
*   **Purified Vero Cell Rabies Vaccine (PVRV)** [e.g., Verorab]
*   **Purified Duck Embryo Vaccine (PDEV)**,,

**Properties:**
*   **Potency:** Must be $\ge$ **2.5 IU** per single intramuscular dose,.
*   **Storage:** +2°C to +8°C (Do not freeze),.
*   **Reconstitution:** Must be used immediately or within **6–8 hours** of reconstitution.

### **2. Indications for Vaccination**
The decision to vaccinate depends on the category of exposure.

**Table: Categories of Contact & Recommended Prophylaxis**,,

| Category | Type of Contact with Suspect Rabid Animal | Recommended Prophylaxis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Category I** | • Touching or feeding animals<br>• Licks on **intact skin** | **None** (if history is reliable).<br>Wash exposed skin. |
| **Category II** | • Nibbling of uncovered skin<br>• Minor scratches/abrasions **without bleeding** | **Vaccine only** (Immediate).<br>Local wound management. |
| **Category III** | • Single/multiple **transdermal bites** or scratches<br>• Licks on **broken skin**<br>• Contamination of **mucous membranes** with saliva<br>• All bites by wild animals/bats | **Vaccine + [[Rabies Immunoglobulin]] (RIG)**.<br>Local wound management. |

> **Clinical Relevance:** In developing countries, the vaccination status of the biting animal should **not** be considered when deciding to initiate prophylaxis. If the animal remains healthy for **10 days**, prophylaxis can be discontinued.

### **3. Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) Schedules**

#### **A. Intramuscular (IM) Regimens**
Administered into the **Deltoid muscle** (adults) or **Anterolateral thigh** (children < 2 years). *Never in the gluteal region.*

1.  **Essen Regimen (5-Dose Schedule)**,
    *   **Dose:** 1 dose (0.5 ml or 1.0 ml depending on brand) per visit.
    *   **Days:** **0, 3, 7, 14, and 28**.
    *   *Total:* 5 visits, 5 doses.

2.  **Zagreb Regimen (Abbreviated Multisite / 2-1-1)**,
    *   **Day 0:** 2 doses (One in right deltoid, one in left deltoid).
    *   **Day 7:** 1 dose.
    *   **Day 21:** 1 dose.
    *   *Total:* 3 visits, 4 doses.

#### **B. Intradermal (ID) Regimens**
Cost-effective as it requires less vaccine volume.

1.  **Updated Thai Red Cross Regimen (2-site)**,
    *   **Dose:** **0.1 ml** per site.
    *   **Sites:** 2 sites (Deltoids or Thighs).
    *   **Days:** **0, 3, 7, and 28**.
    *   *Total:* 4 visits.

---

### **4. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)**
*   **Target Group:** High-risk occupations (Veterinarians, dog catchers, lab staff working with Lyssavirus) and travelers to high-risk areas.
*   **Schedule:** 3 Doses on **Day 0, 7, and 21 (or 28)**,.
*   **Booster:** Required if antibody titre falls below 0.5 IU/ml (checked every 6 months for lab workers, every 2 years for others).

---

### **5. Re-Exposure Prophylaxis**
For individuals who have **documented** previous full vaccination (Pre or Post-exposure):
*   **Treatment:** Only **2 doses** on **Day 0 and Day 3**.
*   **Note:** [[Rabies Immunoglobulin]] (RIG) is **NOT** indicated,.

---

### **6. Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG)**
Required for **Category III** bites to provide immediate passive immunity before the vaccine induces active antibodies (approx. 7–10 days).

*   **Timing:** Administer as soon as possible (Day 0). Do not give beyond **Day 7** after the first vaccine dose.
*   **Dosage:**
    *   **Human RIG (HRIG):** 20 IU/kg body weight.
    *   **Equine RIG (ERIG):** 40 IU/kg body weight (Sensitivity test required for ERIG).
*   **Administration:** Infiltrate **as much as possible** into and around the wound. Any remaining volume should be injected IM at a site distant from the vaccine site,.

---

### **7. Contraindications & Safety**
*   **Post-Exposure:** Because rabies is 100% fatal, there are **NO absolute contraindications** for PEP. It must be given to pregnant women, lactating mothers, and infants if exposed.
*   **Pre-Exposure:** Contraindicated if there was a severe reaction to a previous dose.
*   **Avoid:** Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants during treatment as they may depress the immune response.

---

### **Mnemonic**
**"Real Doctors Treat Rabies"** (For the Essen Schedule)
*   **R**eal (Day 0)
*   **D**octors (Day 3)
*   **T**reat (Day 7)
*   **R**abies (Day 14)
*   *...and 28 days later (Zombie movie reference for the last dose).*

**Zagreb Schedule:** **"2-1-1"**
*   **2** arms on Day 0.
*   **1** dose on Day 7.
*   **1** dose on Day 21.
