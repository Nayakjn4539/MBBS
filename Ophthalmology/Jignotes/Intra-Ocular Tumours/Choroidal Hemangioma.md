# [[Choroidal Hemangioma]]

## Overview
**[[Choroidal Hemangioma]]** is a benign vascular tumor (hamartoma) of the [[Choroid]]. It is of congenital origin but often presents later in life due to its slow growth. It is considered an angiomatous hamartoma rather than a true neoplasm.

## Classification
It occurs in two distinct clinical forms:

| Feature | **Circumscribed (Solitary)** | **Diffuse** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Laterality** | Usually Unilateral | Usually Unilateral (ipsilateral to facial nevus) |
| **Association** | Non-syndromic (Isolated) | Associated with [[Sturge-Weber Syndrome]] (Encephalofacial Angiomatosis) |
| **Growth** | Exceedingly slow growth | Diffuse thickening of the choroid |
| **Appearance** | Localized, dome-shaped nodule | Diffuse, deep red discoloration ("Tomato Ketchup" fundus) |

## Clinical Features

### 1. Localized/Circumscribed Choroidal Hemangioma
*   **Appearance:**
    *   Raised, dome-shaped swelling.
    *   **Colour:** Orange-red or "Salmon pink" hue.
    *   **Location:** Usually situated at the [[Posterior Pole]] of the eye, often near the [[Optic Disc]].
    *   **Margins:** Indefinite or blending margins (unlike the sharp margins of a nevus).
*   **Associated Retinal Changes:**
    *   **[[Exudative Retinal Detachment]]:** Fluid accumulates in the subretinal space due to leakage from the tumor.
    *   **[[Cystoid Macular Edema]]** (Cystoid degeneration).
    *   **RPE Changes:** Pigment epithelial mottling or fibrous metaplasia over the tumor surface.

### 2. Diffuse Choroidal Hemangioma
*   **Appearance:** Causes a diffuse, deep red discoloration of the fundus. This is often described as a **"Tomato Ketchup"** fundus comparison to the non-affected eye.
*   **Systemic Association:** Strong association with **[[Sturge-Weber Syndrome]]** (defined by [[Port-Wine Stain]]/Naevus Flammeus on the face, leptomeningeal angioma, and congenital [[Glaucoma]]).

### Clinical Implications
> **Diagnostic Challenge:** A circumscribed hemangioma can be mistaken for an amelanotic [[Choroidal Melanoma]] or [[Choroidal Metastasis]]. The orange-red color distinctive of hemangioma contrasts with the cream/yellow color of metastasis.

## Investigations

### 1. [[Fundus Fluorescein Angiography]] (FFA)
*   Usually diagnostic.
*   **Early Phase:** The vascular channels within the hemangioma fluoresce *before* the surrounding [[Choriocapillaris]].
*   **Late Phase:** Shows diffuse hyperfluorescence (staining) and leakage if subretinal fluid is present.

### 2. [[Indocyanine Green Angiography]] (ICG)
*   Better visualization of the vascular architecture due to the vascular nature of the tumor.
*   Specific "washout phenomenon" (rapid filling and rapid emptying) may be observed.

### 3. [[Ultrasonography]] (USG)
*   **A-Scan:** High internal reflectivity (due to multiple vascular channels/blood-vessel interfaces). This helps differentiate it from [[Malignant Melanoma]] (which typically has low internal reflectivity).
*   **B-Scan:** Shows a dome-shaped, acoustically solid mass.

### 4. [[Optical Coherence Tomography]] (OCT)
*   Useful to detect subretinal fluid (Exudative [[Retinal Detachment]]) and retinoschisis associated with the tumor.

## Differential Diagnosis
*   Amelanotic [[Malignant Melanoma]].
*   [[Choroidal Metastasis]] (Secondary Carcinoma).
*   [[Posterior Scleritis]] (Can present as a mass lesion).
*   [[Choroidal Osteoma]].
*   Central Serous Chorioretinopathy ([[CSCR]]).

## Management
Treatment is indicated primarily when the tumor causes visual symptoms, usually due to exudation or retinal detachment.

| Tumor Characteristic/Location | Preferred Treatment Modality |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Juxta-papillary tumors** | **[[Photodynamic Therapy]] (PDT)** |
| **Posterior tumors** (away from disc/fovea) | **[[Laser Photocoagulation]]** |
| **Peripheral tumors** (anterior to equator) | **[[Cryotherapy]]** |
| **Large tumors** | **[[Brachytherapy]]** (Plaque Radiotherapy) |

*   **Observation:** Recommended for asymptomatic patients with no subretinal fluid.
*   **Vitreoretinal Surgery:** Required for anterior complications like non-absorbing [[Vitreous Hemorrhage]], tractional bands, or tractional retinal detachment.
