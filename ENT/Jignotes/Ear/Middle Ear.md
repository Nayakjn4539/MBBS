### Anatomy and Physiology of the Middle Ear

The [[Middle Ear]] (Tympanic Cavity) is an air-filled, irregular, laterally compressed space within the petrous part of the [[temporal bone]]. It acts as an impedance matching device to transmit sound from the air-filled external ear to the fluid-filled [[inner ear]].

### I. Developmental Anatomy (Embryology)
*   **Middle Ear Cleft:** Includes the [[Eustachian tube]], [[middle ear]] cavity, [[aditus]], [[antrum]], and [[mastoid air cells]].
*   **Origin:** Develops from the **tubotympanic recess**, which arises from the **First Pharyngeal Pouch** (Endoderm).
*   **Ossicles:**
    *   **Malleus & Incus:** Derived from the **1st Pharyngeal Arch** (Meckel’s cartilage).
    *   **Stapes:** Superstructure develops from the **2nd Pharyngeal Arch** (Reichert’s cartilage); Footplate develops from the **otic capsule**,.
*   **Muscles:**
    *   **Tensor Tympani:** 1st Arch derivative (Supplied by V3).
    *   **Stapedius:** 2nd Arch derivative (Supplied by VII).

### II. Divisions and Dimensions
The middle ear is shaped like a biconcave disc (narrower in the center).
*   **Vertical & Antero-posterior diameter:** ~15 mm.
*   **Transverse diameter:**
    *   Widest at the top (Epitympanum): 6 mm.
    *   Narrowest at the center (Mesotympanum): 2 mm (between [[umbo]] and [[promontory]]).
    *   Bottom (Hypotympanum): 4 mm.

**Subdivisions of the Tympanic Cavity:**,
| Division | Location | Contents |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Epitympanum (Attic)** | Above the level of malleolar folds/pars tensa. | Head of malleus, Body of incus. |
| **Mesotympanum** | Opposite the pars tensa. | Handle of malleus, Long process of incus, Stapes. |
| **Hypotympanum** | Below the level of tympanic sulcus. | Lower part of the cavity. |
| **Protympanum** | Area around the Eustachian tube orifice. | Eustachian tube opening. |

**Clinical Implication:** **Prussak's Space** lies in the epitympanum, bounded laterally by [[Pars Flaccida]] and medially by the neck of the [[Malleus]]. It is the most common site for the formation of primary acquired **cholesteatoma**,.

### III. Boundaries (The "Six-Sided Box")
The middle ear can be visualized as a box with six walls,.

> Schematic of the middle ear as a box showing relations to IJV, ICA, Tegmen, and Labyrinth

#### 1. Roof (Tegmental Wall)
*   Formed by **Tegmen Tympani** (thin plate of petrous temporal bone).
*   Separates the middle ear from the **middle cranial fossa** (temporal lobe).
*   Extends posteriorly as *tegmen antri*.

#### 2. Floor (Jugular Wall)
*   Formed by a thin plate of bone separating the hypotympanum from the [[Jugular Bulb]].
*   **Clinical Note:** This bone may be dehiscent, causing the jugular bulb to project into the middle ear (appearing as a blue mass behind the TM), putting it at risk during myringotomy,.

#### 3. Anterior Wall (Carotid Wall)
*   Separates the middle ear from the [[Internal Carotid Artery]].
*   **Openings:**
    *   **Eustachian Tube** orifice (lower).
    *   Canal for **Tensor Tympani** muscle (upper).
    *   Canal of Huguier (for exit of [[chorda tympani]]).

#### 4. Posterior Wall (Mastoid Wall)
*   **Aditus ad antrum:** An opening connecting the attic to the [[mastoid antrum]].
*   **Pyramid (Pyramidal eminence):** A bony projection housing the [[stapedius]] muscle; the tendon emerges from the apex.
*   **Facial Nerve (Vertical segment):** Runs vertically behind the pyramid.
*   **Facial Recess (Suprapyramidal recess):** Lateral to the facial nerve.
    *   *Surgical Importance:* Used for "Posterior Tympanotomy" approach in cochlear implantation and intact canal wall mastoidectomy to access the middle ear,.
*   **Sinus Tympani (Infrapyramidal recess):** Medial to the facial nerve, bounded by ponticulus (above) and subiculum (below).
    *   *Clinical Importance:* Considered the **"hidden area"** of the middle ear; difficult to clean during surgery and a common site for residual **cholesteatoma**,.

#### 5. Medial Wall (Labyrinthine Wall)
*   Separates middle ear from the [[inner ear]].
*   **Promontory:** A bulge produced by the basal turn of the [[cochlea]].
*   **Oval Window (Fenestra Vestibuli):** Located posterosuperiorly; occupied by the [[stapes footplate]].
*   **Round Window (Fenestra Cochleae):** Located posteroinferiorly; closed by the secondary tympanic membrane.
*   **Horizontal Facial Nerve Canal:** Runs above the oval window.
    *   *Clinical Note:* Most common site for **facial nerve dehiscence**.
*   **Processus Cochleariformis:** A bony hook where the tensor tympani tendon turns laterally to attach to the malleus.

#### 6. Lateral Wall (Membranous Wall)
*   Formed mainly by the [[Tympanic Membrane]] (Pars Tensa).
*   Superiorly formed by the bony outer attic wall (**Scutum**).

### IV. Contents of the Middle Ear

#### 1. Ossicles
These transmit sound from the TM to the oval window.
*   **[[Malleus]] (Hammer):** Largest. Parts: Head, Neck, Handle (Manubrium), Anterior and Lateral processes. Handle attaches to TM.
*   **[[Incus]] (Anvil):** Parts: Body, Short process (in fossa incudis), Long process (articulates with stapes). The **Lenticular process** (tip of long process) is the most common site of necrosis in CSOM due to precarious blood supply.
*   **[[Stapes]] (Stirrup):** Smallest bone (2.5 mg). Parts: Head, Neck, Anterior/Posterior Crura, Footplate. Footplate covers the oval window.

#### 2. Intratympanic Muscles
| Muscle | Origin | Insertion | Nerve Supply | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tensor Tympani** | Canal above ET | Neck of Malleus | **V3** (Mandibular) | Tenses TM |
| **Stapedius** | Pyramidal eminence | Neck of Stapes | **CN VII** (Facial) | Dampens loud sounds (Acoustic Reflex) |,

#### 3. Nerves
*   **[[Chorda Tympani]]:** Branch of CN VII. Enters via posterior wall, passes between incus and malleus, exits via anterior wall (Canal of Huguier). Carries taste from anterior 2/3 of tongue.
*   **[[Tympanic Plexus]]:** Located on the promontory. Formed by **Jacobson’s nerve** (tympanic branch of CN IX) and caroticotympanic nerves (sympathetic). Provides sensory supply to the middle ear and secretomotor fibers to the parotid gland,.

### V. Eustachian Tube (Pharyngotympanic Tube)
*   **Length:** 36 mm in adults (24 mm cartilaginous, 12 mm bony).
*   **Direction:** Downwards, forwards, and medially.
*   **Isthmus:** Narrowest part at the junction of bony and cartilaginous parts.
*   **Lining:** Ciliated columnar epithelium (Respiratory).
*   **Function:** Ventilation (pressure equalization), Protection (from reflux), Clearance (mucociliary drainage).
*   **Opening Mechanism:** Opened actively by **Tensor Veli Palatini** (primary dilator) during swallowing/yawning.
*   **Infant vs. Adult:**
    *   Infants: Shorter, wider, more horizontal. Result: Higher risk of ascending infections (Acute Otitis Media) from nasopharynx.

---

### VI. Mastoid Antrum
*   Largest air cell within the petrous temporal bone.
*   Communicates with the middle ear via the **Aditus ad Antrum**.
*   **Surface Landmark:** [[Macewen's Triangle]] (Suprameatal triangle).
    *   Boundaries: Supramastoid crest (Superior), Posterosuperior margin of EAC (Anterior), Tangent to EAC (Posterior).
*   **Korner's Septum:** A persistent petrosquamosal suture deep inside the mastoid; separates superficial squamosal cells from deep petrosal cells. Can be a surgical barrier,.

### VII. Physiology: Middle Ear Transformer Mechanism
Since sound reflects when passing from air to fluid (Impedance Mismatch), the middle ear amplifies sound to ensure transmission to the cochlea. Total gain is approx. **22:1** or **27-33 dB**.

1.  **Areal/Hydraulic Ratio (Major factor):**
    *   Effective vibratory area of TM (55 mm²) vs. Stapes footplate area (3.2 mm²).
    *   Ratio = **17:1** (or 14:1).
2.  **Lever Action:**
    *   Handle of malleus is longer than the long process of incus.
    *   Ratio = **1.3:1**.
3.  **Catenary/Curved Membrane Effect:**
    *   Buckling effect of the TM moving more at the periphery than the center.

**Phase Difference:** Sound reaches the oval window via ossicles before it reaches the round window (via air). This phase lag prevents cancellation of the sound wave in the cochlear fluid.

### VIII. Histology of Lining Epithelium
The lining changes from anterior to posterior:
*   **Eustachian Tube & Anterior Tympanum:** Ciliated columnar (Respiratory).
*   **Posterior Tympanum:** Cuboidal.
*   **Attic & Mastoid:** Flat, non-ciliated (Squamous-like).
