# [[Nerve Injuries]] > Classification of Nerve Injuries

### Classification of Peripheral Nerve Injuries

Peripheral nerve injuries are classified to determine the degree of tissue damage, the potential for recovery, and the appropriate management strategy. The two standard systems used are **Seddon’s Classification** (1943) and **Sunderland’s Classification** (1951).

---

### 1. Seddon’s Classification (1943)
Seddon described three distinct types of nerve injury based on the structural integrity of the nerve fiber.

#### A. [[Neurapraxia]] (First Degree Injury)
*   **Definition:** A transient physiological block in the conduction of the nerve impulse without any anatomical discontinuity or structural damage to the axon.
*   **Pathology:**
    *   Usually caused by mild compression or contusion (e.g., [[Saturday night palsy]], [[Crutch palsy]]).
    *   There is segmental demyelination, but the **axon remains intact**.
    *   **No [[Wallerian degeneration]]** occurs distal to the lesion.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Motor paralysis is usually more profound than sensory loss.
    *   Autonomic function is usually preserved.
    *   [[Tinel's sign]] is negative (no advancing regeneration).
*   **Prognosis:** Excellent. Spontaneous and complete recovery occurs within days to weeks (usually 6 weeks) once the cause (compression) is removed.

#### B. [[Axonotmesis]] (Second Degree Injury)
*   **Definition:** Disruption of the axons and their myelin sheaths, but the supporting connective tissue stroma ([[endoneurium]], [[perineurium]], and [[epineurium]]) remains intact.
*   **Pathology:**
    *   Typically caused by traction or crush injuries (e.g., [[fracture]] or dislocation).
    *   **[[Wallerian degeneration]]** occurs in the distal segment of the nerve.
    *   Because the endoneurial tubes are intact, regenerating axons are guided directly to their target organs.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Complete motor, sensory, and autonomic paralysis in the distribution of the nerve.
    *   Muscle atrophy occurs.
    *   [[Tinel's sign]] is positive and advances distally at the rate of regeneration.
*   **Prognosis:** Good. Spontaneous recovery is possible. Regeneration occurs at a rate of approximately **1 mm/day** (or 1 inch/month). Recovery follows a specific **"Motor March"** (proximal muscles recover before distal muscles).

#### C. [[Neurotmesis]] (Fifth Degree Injury)
*   **Definition:** Complete anatomical severance or severe internal disruption of the entire nerve trunk, including axons and all connective tissue layers.
*   **Pathology:**
    *   Caused by sharp injuries (e.g., knife cut, glass) or severe traction ruptures.
    *   **[[Wallerian degeneration]]** occurs distally.
    *   Due to the loss of connective tissue continuity, regenerating axons often form a disorganized mass called a **[[Neuroma]]** at the proximal stump.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Total loss of motor, sensory, and autonomic function.
    *   No recovery without surgical intervention.
*   **Prognosis:** Poor without surgical repair. Even with repair, recovery is often incomplete due to scarring and misdirection of regenerating axons.

### 2. Sunderland’s Classification (1951)
Sunderland expanded Seddon’s classification into five degrees to describe the involvement of the connective tissue layers more precisely. This is clinically useful for predicting prognosis in mixed injuries.

#### Anatomy Recap for Sunderland's
*   **[[Endoneurium]]:** Surrounds individual axons.
*   **[[Perineurium]]:** Surrounds bundles of axons (fascicles).
*   **[[Epineurium]]:** Surrounds the entire nerve trunk.

| Degree | Structure Injured | Structure Intact | Seddon’s Equivalent | Pathology/Prognosis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **First Degree** | [[Myelin]] (Conduction block) | [[Axon]], Endoneurium, Perineurium, Epineurium | **[[Neurapraxia]]** | Local demyelination. Full recovery within weeks. |
| **Second Degree** | Axon | [[Endoneurium]], Perineurium, Epineurium | **[[Axonotmesis]]** | Wallerian degeneration occurs. Endoneurial tube guides regeneration. Complete recovery expected. |
| **Third Degree** | Axon, Endoneurium | [[Perineurium]], Epineurium | Axonotmesis / Neurotmesis hybrid | Endoneurial disruption leads to intrafascicular fibrosis. Axons may misdirect (cross-innervation). Recovery is incomplete/imperfect. |
| **Fourth Degree** | Axon, Endoneurium, Perineurium | [[Epineurium]] | Neurotmesis (in continuity) | Nerve trunk is physically intact but functionally ruined by severe internal scarring (**[[Neuroma in continuity]]**). No useful recovery without surgery. |
| **Fifth Degree** | Entire Nerve Trunk | None | **[[Neurotmesis]]** | Complete transection. Requires surgical repair. |

*(Note: Some texts refer to a "Sixth Degree" which represents a mixed injury where some fascicles are normal, some neurapraxic, and others severed).*

### Clinical Implications and Diagnosis

*   **Tinel’s Sign:**
    *   **Non-progressive:** A tingling sensation felt at the site of the lesion but not advancing distally suggests a neuroma (Grade IV or V injury) or lack of regeneration.
    *   **Progressive:** If the point of tingling advances distally over time, it indicates regenerating axons (Grade II or III).
*   **Motor March:** In [[Axonotmesis]], muscles recover in a predictable anatomical sequence from proximal to distal. Failure of the next muscle in line to recover by the expected time (calculated at 1mm/day) suggests a more severe lesion requiring exploration.
*   **Electromyography ([[EMG]]):**
    *   **Neurapraxia:** No fibrillation potentials (denervation) seen after 3 weeks because the axon is intact.
    *   **Axonotmesis/Neurotmesis:** Fibrillation potentials (denervation) appear after 2–3 weeks due to Wallerian degeneration.

### Summary Comparison Table

| Feature | Neurapraxia | Axonotmesis | Neurotmesis |

| **Wallerian Degeneration**| Absent | Present | Present |
| **Conduction Distal to Lesion** | Preserved | Lost | Lost |
| **Muscle Atrophy** | Absent/Minimal | Present | Present |
| **Sunderland Grade** | Grade I | Grade II, III, IV | Grade V |
| **Recovery** | Spontaneous, Rapid, Complete | Spontaneous, Slow (1mm/day) | Requires Surgery, Incomplete |

### Mnemonics

    *   **A**xon only damaged ([[Axonotmesis]])
    *   **N**o nerve continuity ([[Neurotmesis]])

*   **Sunderland's Layers:** (What is broken?)
