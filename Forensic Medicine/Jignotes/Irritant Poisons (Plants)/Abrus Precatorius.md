# [[Irritant Poisons (Plants)]] > Abrus Precatorius

### Abrus Precatorius

**Synonyms:** Jequirity, Rosary Pea, Indian Liquorice, Gunchi, **Rati**, Crab’s eye.

#### Physical Appearance
*   **Family:** [[Leguminosae]].
*   **Seeds:** The most medicolegally significant part.
    *   **Shape:** Spherical or egg-shaped (ovoid).
    *   **Size:** Approx 8 x 5 mm.
    *   **Weight:** Average weight is **105 mg** (used by jewelers as a weighing unit called 'Rati').
    *   **Color:** Characteristic **scarlet red** with a **black spot** at one pole (hilum).
*   **Note:** White varieties of seeds also exist but are rare.

#### Active Principles
1.  **[[Abrin]]:** A **toxalbumin** (phytotoxin). It is thermodynamically unstable (thermolabile) and loses toxicity upon boiling/cooking. It is a "Super Toxin".
2.  **Abrine:** An amino acid (glucoside).
3.  **Haemagglutinin:** Causes clumping of red blood cells.

#### Mechanism of Action
*   **Cytotoxic:** Inhibits cellular protein synthesis (similar to [[Ricin]] from Castor).
*   **Haemotoxic:** Causes agglutination and hemolysis of RBCs.
*   **Local Irritant:** Produces severe inflammation, edema, and necrosis at the site of contact/injection.

#### Fatal Dose and Period
*   **Fatal Dose:**
    *   **Ingested:** 1 to 2 **crushed** seeds (approx. 90–120 mg).
    *   **Injected:** 15–30 µg (Subcutaneously, Abrin is 100 times more toxic than Ricin).
    *   **Note:** Swallowing **intact/unbroken seeds** is usually non-toxic because the hard outer testa (seed coat) resists gastric digestion, and seeds pass unchanged in feces.
*   **Fatal Period:** 3 to 5 days.

### Clinical Features

#### 1. Ingestion (Crushed Seeds)
Symptoms resemble severe gastroenteritis:
*   Nausea, vomiting, and severe abdominal pain.
*   Bloody diarrhea (dysentery-like).
*   Systemic effects: Weakness, cold perspiration, trembling, rapid weak pulse, and convulsions.
*   **Delayed effects:** Cytotoxicity to liver and kidneys (uremia) occurs after a few days.

#### 2. Injection (Use of 'Suis')
Usually used for cattle poisoning but occasionally in humans.
*   **Local:** Inflammation, painful swelling, edema, and necrosis at the puncture site. Oozing of hemorrhagic fluid.
*   **Systemic:** Pyrexia, faintness, vertigo, and fatal cardiac collapse.
*   **Mimicry:** The lesion strongly resembles a [[Viperine snake bite]].

#### 3. Ocular Exposure
*   Powdered seeds applied to conjunctiva cause severe purulent conjunctivitis, corneal opacity, and potential blindness.

### Management
1.  **Decontamination:**
    *   **Ingestion:** Stomach wash (Gastric lavage) with activated charcoal.
    *   **Injection:** The needle (Sui) must be **dissected out** surgically. The surrounding necrotic tissue should be excised.
2.  **Antidote:** Injection of **Anti-abrin** (if available).
3.  **Supportive Care:**
    *   Fluid and electrolyte replacement for diarrhea.
    *   **Alkalinization of urine:** Sodium bicarbonate (10g/day) to prevent agglutinated Hb form blocking renal tubules.
    *   Treatment of convulsions with Diazepam.

### Autopsy Findings
*   **External:**
    *   Fragments of the needle (Sui) may be found in the wound.
    *   Local edema and necrosis at the site of injection.
*   **Internal:**
    *   **GIT:** Mucosa of the stomach and intestine shows congestion, inflammation, and submucosal hemorrhages (patchy hemorrhagic gastritis).
    *   **Viscera:** Generalized congestion of liver, spleen, and kidneys.
    *   **Serous membranes:** Petechial hemorrhages under the pleura, pericardium, and peritoneum.

### Medicolegal Aspects

**1. Cattle Poisoning (Sui Poisoning):**
This is the most common use. Hides of cattle killed this way are valuable as they have no flaws.
*   **Preparation of Sui (Needle):** Seeds are decorticated (shelled), soaked in water, and ground into a paste with onion, datura, opium, and spirit. This paste is molded into sharp needles (1.5 cm long) and dried in the sun.
*   **Method:** The needle is fitted into a wooden handle and driven into the animal's skin with a blow.

**2. Homicide:**
*   Rare in humans. The "Sui" may be thrust into a person's skin (slapping while holding the needle between fingers) to cause death that mimics a snake bite.

**3. Malingering:**
*   Powder is put in eyes to produce artificial conjunctivitis to avoid duty or claim compensation.

**4. Accidental Poisoning:**
*   Common in children due to the attractive bright red color of the seeds (mistaken for sweets/beads).

**5. Arrow Poison:**
*   Used by tribes in parts of India and Africa.

### Distinction: Sui Poisoning vs. Viper Snake Bite

| Feature | Sui Poisoning ([[Abrus precatorius]]) | [[Viperine Snake Bite]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **History** | No history of snake bite; suspicion of foul play. | History of snake bite usually present. |
| **Puncture Marks** | Usually single, large, and irregular. | Two distinct fang marks (deep). |
| **Foreign Body** | **Needle (Sui)** fragment found in the wound. | No foreign body; fangs rarely broken. |
| **Progression** | Symptoms develop slowly (days). | Symptoms develop rapidly (hours). |
| **Systemic Signs** | Generalized muscle weakness, arrhythmia. | Hematuria, bleeding from gums/rectum (hemotoxic). |
| **Chemical Analysis** | Extracts of Abrin found in tissue. | Snake venom found in tissue. |

### Mnemonic
**"RATI"**
*   **R**ed seeds with black dot.
*   **A**gglutination of RBCs (Abrin).
*   **T**oxalbumin (Resembles Viper venom).
*   **I**njection (Sui) for cattle poisoning.
