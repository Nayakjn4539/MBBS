# Coxa Vara and Coxa Valga

## 1. Anatomical Basis: The Neck-Shaft Angle
The **Neck-Shaft Angle (NSA)**, also known as the [[angle of inclination]], is the angle formed between the long axis of the [[femoral neck]] and the long axis of the [[femoral shaft]]. This angle is crucial for the biomechanics of the [[hip joint]], allowing the femoral shaft to swing clear of the pelvis during movement.

*   **Normal Angle:** typically **120°–135°** in adults.
    *   It is higher in infants (~150°) and decreases with age as the child assumes weight-bearing postures.
*   **Measurement:** assessed on an AP radiograph of the pelvis/hip with the leg internally rotated 15° to compensate for [[femoral anteversion]].

## 2. Coxa Vara
Defined as a decrease in the femoral neck-shaft angle to **less than 120°**. This deformity alters the biomechanics of the hip, shortening the limb and reducing the efficiency of the [[hip abductors]].

### Etiology and Classification
The causes can be congenital, developmental, or acquired.

#### A. Congenital/Developmental Causes
1.  **[[Congenital Coxa Vara]] (Developmental Coxa Vara):**
    *   A primary defect in enchondral ossification of the inferior part of the femoral neck.
    *   Usually presents in childhood (after walking begins).
2.  **[[Skeletal Dysplasias]]:**
    *   [[Cleidocranial dysostosis]].
    *   [[Metaphyseal dysostosis]].

#### B. Acquired Causes
1.  **Metabolic Bone Disorders:**
    *   **[[Rickets]]/[[Osteomalacia]]:** Softening of the bone leads to bending of the femoral neck under body weight,.
    *   **[[Fibrous Dysplasia]]:** Can lead to the classic **"[[Shepherd's Crook deformity]]"** (severe varus bowing).
2.  **Trauma:**
    *   Malunion of [[intertrochanteric fractures]] or [[femoral neck fractures]].
    *   Traumatic premature closure of the capital femoral physis.
3.  **Infection:**
    *   Sequelae of [[septic arthritis]] (Tom Smith’s arthritis) or [[osteomyelitis]] affecting the proximal femur.
4.  **Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis ([[SCFE]]):**
    *   Also historically termed "Adolescent Coxa Vara" or "Epiphyseal Coxa Vara".
5.  **[[Perthes Disease]]:**
    *   Avascular necrosis can lead to collapse and varus deformity (Coxa Magna and Coxa Plana).

### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Often painless in developmental types.
    *   **Limp:** The most common presenting complaint.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Gait:** [[Trendelenburg gait]] (lurching to the affected side) due to abductor inefficiency. If bilateral, a "waddling gait" is seen.
    *   **Shortening:** True [[supratrochanteric shortening]] of the limb.
    *   **Greater Trochanter:** Prominent and elevated (lies above Nélaton’s line).
    *   **Range of Motion:**
        *   **Restricted:** [[Abduction]] and [[Internal Rotation]].
        *   **Increased:** [[Adduction]].

### Radiological Features
*   **Neck-Shaft Angle:** < 120°.
*   **[[Shenton's Line]]:** Broken/disrupted.
*   **Specific to Congenital Coxa Vara:**
    *   Vertical femoral physis.
    *   **Fairbank’s Triangle:** A triangular osseous fragment in the inferior femoral neck.
    *   **Inverted Y sign.**
*   **HE Angle ([[Hilgenreiner-Epiphyseal Angle]]):** Used for prognosis in developmental coxa vara.
    *   Normal: < 25°.
    *   > 60°: Indication for surgery as progression is inevitable.

### Treatment
1.  **Observation:** For mild cases (HE angle < 45°) with no significant shortening.
2.  **Corrective Osteotomy:**
    *   Indicated for HE angle > 60°, progressive deformity, or significant limp/shortening.
    *   **[[Valgus Osteotomy]]:** usually intertrochanteric or subtrochanteric (e.g., [[Pauwel’s osteotomy]] or Y-osteotomy). This restores the neck-shaft angle, improves abductor mechanics, and restores length.

**Clinical Implication:** Untreated coxa vara predisposes to [[femoral neck fractures]] due to increased shear forces across the vertical physis and secondary [[osteoarthritis]] later in life.

## 3. Coxa Valga
Defined as an increase in the femoral neck-shaft angle to **greater than 135°–140°**. It is essentially the persistence of the infantile angle due to a lack of mechanical loading.

### Etiology
Coxa valga is rarely an isolated primary deformity; it is usually secondary to other pathologies.

1.  **Lack of Weight Bearing:**
    *   Paralysis or prolonged bed rest in children.
    *   Without the compressive force of body weight, the physiologic decrease in NSA does not occur.
2.  **Neuromuscular Disorders:**
    *   **[[Cerebral Palsy]]:** Muscle imbalance (spasticity) and delayed walking.
    *   **[[Poliomyelitis]]:** Flaccid paralysis reduces loading.
3.  **[[Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip]] (DDH):**
    *   The femoral head does not articulate properly within the acetabulum, reducing the molding forces.

### Clinical Features
*   **Limp:** Often masked by the underlying neuromuscular condition.
*   **Lengthening:** Relative lengthening of the limb (though often the limb is short due to the primary neurological cause, e.g., polio).
*   **Instability:** The femoral head is more vertical, increasing the risk of [[hip subluxation]] or dislocation.

### Radiological Features
*   **Neck-Shaft Angle:** > 140°.
*   **Femoral Head Coverage:** Often decreased, leading to a break in Shenton’s line (if subluxated).

### Treatment
*   **Treat the Underlying Cause:** e.g., muscle releases in Cerebral Palsy.
*   **[[Varus Osteotomy]]:** Indicated if the hip is subluxating or painful. The femur is cut and angled to reduce the NSA, improving containment of the femoral head within the acetabulum.

## 4. Comparison: Coxa Vara vs. Coxa Valga

| Feature | **Coxa Vara** | **Coxa Valga** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Neck-Shaft Angle** | **< 120°** | **> 135°** |
| **Limb Length** | Shortened | Relatively Lengthened |
| **Abductor Mechanism** | Weak (shortened lever arm) | Weak (mechanically inefficient) |
| **Gait** | **Trendelenburg / Waddling** | Often unstable / neurological gait |
| **Common Causes** | Congenital, Rickets, SCFE, Trauma | Cerebral Palsy, Polio, DDH, Non-weight bearing |
| **Hip Stability** | Stable (but prone to neck fractures) | **Unstable** (prone to subluxation/dislocation) |
| **Range of Motion** | Limited Abduction | Limited Adduction |
| **Corrective Surgery** | **Valgus Osteotomy** | **Varus Osteotomy** |

### Mnemonics
*   **VARA** = **V**a-**R**educed **A**ngle (< 120°).
*   **VALGA** = **V**a-**L**ar**G**e **A**ngle (> 135°).
*   **Deformity direction:** In **Varus**, the distal part (shaft) deviates towards the midline. In **Valgus**, the distal part deviates away from the midline.
