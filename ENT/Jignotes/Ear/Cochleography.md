### Electrocochleography (ECochG/ECoG)

**Electrocochleography** is an objective electrophysiological test that measures the electrical potentials generated in the [[Cochlea]] and the distal portion of the [[Auditory Nerve]] (CN VIII) in response to acoustic stimulation. It focuses on the electrical activity occurring within the first 5 to 10 milliseconds after a sound stimulus.

#### Principle
The test records electrical activity generated by the inner ear and the auditory nerve upon sound stimulation. It is particularly useful for assessing the hydrodynamic status of the [[Cochlea]].

#### Components of ECochG Waveform
The recording consists of three distinct electrical potentials:

1.  **Cochlear Microphonics (CM)**
    *   **Source:** Generated primarily by the [[Outer Hair Cells]] (OHCs).
    *   **Nature:** It is an alternating current (AC) potential that mimics the waveform of the sound stimulus (acts like a microphone).
    *   **Characteristics:** It has no latency and no refractory period. It reflects the instantaneous displacement of the [[Basilar Membrane]].
    *   **Clinical Relevance:** Absence of CM indicates damage to hair cells.

2.  **Summating Potential (SP)**
    *   **Source:** Generated primarily by the [[Inner Hair Cells]] (IHCs), with some contribution from OHCs.
    *   **Nature:** It is a direct current (DC) potential (shift in the baseline).
    *   **Characteristics:** It follows the "envelope" of the stimulating sound. It represents the non-linear distortion of cochlear mechanics.
    *   **Clinical Relevance:** In conditions like [[Endolymphatic Hydrops]], the SP becomes enlarged (more negative) due to distention of the basilar membrane.

3.  **Action Potential (AP)**
    *   **Source:** Generated by the distal portion of the [[Auditory Nerve]] (CN VIII).
    *   **Nature:** It is the summed synchronous neural discharge of auditory nerve fibers.
    *   **Characteristics:** This is an "all-or-none" response. It corresponds to **Wave I** of the [[Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry]] (BERA).
    *   **Clinical Relevance:** Its magnitude reflects the number of firing nerve fibers.

#### Procedure and Electrode Placement
The test requires a sound stimulus (usually clicks or tone bursts) and recording electrodes. The placement of the electrode determines the quality of the signal.

| Technique | Electrode Placement | Anesthesia | Signal Quality | Invasiveness |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Transtympanic (TT)** | A thin needle electrode is passed through the [[Tympanic Membrane]] to rest on the **Cochlear Promontory**. | Local/General | High (Close to source) | Invasive |
| **Extratympanic (ET)** | Electrode placed in the ear canal or on the tympanic membrane surface. | None | Lower (Needs averaging) | Non-invasive |

#### Indications
1.  **Diagnosis of Ménière’s Disease:** This is the primary clinical use. It helps detect endolymphatic hydrops.
2.  **Differentiating Lesions:** Distinguishing between cochlear and retrocochlear hearing loss.
3.  **Hearing Threshold Estimation:** Useful in infants or uncooperative children to determine thresholds within 5–10 dB (though BERA is often preferred).
4.  **Monitoring:** Intraoperative monitoring during ear surgeries to preserve hearing.
5.  **Diagnosis of Auditory Neuropathy:** Presence of CM with absent AP suggests neuropathy.

#### Interpretation: The SP/AP Ratio
The most clinically significant parameter is the ratio of the amplitude of the **Summating Potential (SP)** to the **Action Potential (AP)**.

*   **Normal Physiology:** The SP is typically smaller than the AP.
*   **Pathology (Ménière’s Disease):** Endolymphatic hydrops increases the pressure in the scala media, altering the biomechanics of the basilar membrane. This leads to an **enhanced (larger)** Summating Potential.
*   **Diagnostic Criteria:**
    *   **Normal:** SP/AP ratio is generally **< 0.30 (30%)** to **< 0.45** depending on the protocol.
    *   **Ménière’s Disease:** SP/AP ratio is **> 0.30** or **> 0.45**.

**Clinical Implications:**
*   **Glycerol Test:** ECochG can be combined with the Glycerol test. If a patient with Ménière’s ingests glycerol (a dehydrating agent), the hydrops may temporarily reduce. A reduction in the SP/AP ratio after glycerol intake confirms the diagnosis.
*   **Superior Semicircular Canal Dehiscence (SSCD):** Some studies suggest ECochG may show an elevated SP/AP ratio in SSCD as well.

#### Mnemonic
To remember the waves:
**"M-S-A"**
*   **M**icrophonic (Outer Hair Cells)
*   **S**ummating (Inner Hair Cells/Hydrops marker)
*   **A**ction Potential (Nerve/Wave I)
