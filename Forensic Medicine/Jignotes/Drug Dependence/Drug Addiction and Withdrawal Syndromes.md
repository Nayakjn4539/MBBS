# [[Drug Dependence]] > Drug Addiction and Withdrawal Syndromes

### **Definitions and Terminology**

**[[Drug Dependence]]**
It is a state of periodic or chronic intoxication produced by the repeated consumption of a drug. It involves a compulsion to take the drug on a continuous or periodic basis to experience its psychic effects and sometimes to avoid the discomfort of its absence.

**[[Drug Addiction]]**
A state of periodic or chronic intoxication produced by the repeated consumption of a drug (natural or synthetic). It is characterized by:
1.  an overpowering desire or need (compulsion) to continue taking the drug and to obtain it by any means.
2.  a tendency to increase the dose (**[[Tolerance]]**).
3.  a psychic (psychological) and generally a physical dependence on the effects of the drug.
4.  detrimental effect on the individual and society.

**[[Drug Habituation]]**
A condition resulting from the repeated consumption of a drug. Its characteristics include:
1.  a desire (but not a compulsion) to continue taking the drug for the sense of improved well-being it engenders.
2.  little or no tendency to increase the dose.
3.  some degree of psychic dependence on the effect of the drug, but absence of physical dependence (no withdrawal symptoms).
4.  detrimental effect, if any, is primarily on the individual.

**Difference between Drug Addiction and Habituation**

| Feature | Drug Addiction | Drug Habituation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Compulsion** | Overpowering compulsion to take the drug | Desire but no compulsion |
| **Dose** | Tendency to increase dose ([[Tolerance]]) | No tendency to increase dose |
| **Dependence** | Physical and Psychological | Psychological only |
| **Withdrawal** | Characteristic symptoms present | No/Mild withdrawal symptoms |
| **Harm** | Harmful to individual and society | Harmful primarily to the individual |

**Types of Dependence**
1.  **[[Physical Dependence]]:** An altered physiological state produced by the repeated administration of a drug, which necessitates the continued administration of the drug to prevent the appearance of a stereotype syndrome, the withdrawal or abstinence syndrome.
2.  **[[Psychological Dependence]]:** A compulsive need or craving for a drug to maintain a state of well-being or to avoid discomfort. It can occur without physical dependence.

### **WHO Classification of Drug Dependence**

The World Health Organization recognizes several types of drug dependence:

1.  **[[Morphine]] Type:**
    *   **Drugs:** Opium, Morphine, Heroin, Pethidine.
    *   **Features:** Strong psychic and physical dependence. Marked tolerance develops.
    *   **Withdrawal:** Severe and characteristic abstinence syndrome.

2.  **[[Barbiturate]]/Alcohol Type:**
    *   **Drugs:** Alcohol, Barbiturates, Sedative-hypnotics.
    *   **Features:** Psychic and physical dependence. Tolerance develops.
    *   **Withdrawal:** Severe; may include convulsions and delirium.

3.  **[[Cocaine]] Type:**
    *   **Drugs:** Cocaine, Coca leaves.
    *   **Features:** Strong psychic dependence. **No physical dependence** (no characteristic abstinence syndrome). High tolerance is *not* usually seen.
    *   **Effects:** Profound mental depression upon withdrawal.

4.  **[[Cannabis]] Type:**
    *   **Drugs:** Bhang, Ganja, Charas, Hashish.
    *   **Features:** Moderate to strong psychic dependence. No physical dependence. No tolerance.

5.  **[[Amphetamine]] Type:**
    *   **Drugs:** Amphetamine, Methamphetamine.
    *   **Features:** Variable psychic dependence. No physical dependence. High tolerance.

### **Specific Withdrawal Syndromes**

#### **1. Opioid Withdrawal ([[Heroin]]/Morphine)**
Withdrawal symptoms appear 6–8 hours after the last dose, peak at 48–72 hours, and subside over 5–10 days. This is often referred to as **"Cold Turkey"** due to piloerection.

**Clinical Stages:**
*   **Early (8–10 hours):** Anxiety, craving, lacrimation (tearing), rhinorrhea (runny nose), yawning, perspiration.
*   **Fully Developed (1–3 days):** [[Mydriasis]] (dilated pupils), tremors, **piloerection** (gooseflesh), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, severe muscle cramps/bone pain, tachycardia, hypertension.

> **Mnemonic for Opioid Withdrawal: "SLUDGE" goes away, everything becomes "DRY" and "HIGH"**
> *Wait, actually Opioid *intoxication* causes constriction and fluids (SLUDGE). Withdrawal is the OPPOSITE:*
> **Mnemonic: "ARMPIT"**
> *   **A**nxiety/Agitation
> *   **R**hinorrhea/Restlessness
> *   **M**uscle cramps/Mydriasis
> *   **P**iloerection (Gooseflesh)/Perspiration
> *   **I**nsomnia
> *   **T**achycardia/Tears (Lacrimation)

**Treatment:**
*   **Methadone substitution:** Long-acting opioid to taper the dose.
*   **[[Clonidine]]:** To manage autonomic hyperactivity.
*   **Buprenorphine:** Partial agonist.

#### **2. Barbiturate and Alcohol Withdrawal**
Abrupt cessation can be life-threatening. Symptoms appear within 24 hours.

*   **Minor:** Anxiety, insomnia, tremors, weakness, nausea.
*   **Major:** **[[Delirium Tremens]]**, hyperthermia, cardiovascular collapse, generalized tonic-clonic **convulsions**.
*   **Specific Sign:** "Rum fits" (Alcoholic seizures).

#### **3. Cocaine Withdrawal**
Cocaine causes strong psychological dependence but no gross physical withdrawal syndrome like opioids.
*   **The "Crash":** Intense dysphoria, depression (suicidal ideation is a major risk), fatigue, hypersomnia (sleepiness), increased appetite.
*   **[[Magnan's Symptom]]:** (Cocaine bugs/Formication) – A tactile hallucination where the addict feels insects crawling under the skin.

### **Autopsy Findings in Drug Addicts**

**External Findings:**
*   **General:** Emaciation, malnutrition, poor hygiene, tattoos (often used to hide needle marks).
*   **Needle Tracks:**
    *   **"Mainlining":** Linear scars over veins (antecubital fossa, forearm, dorsum of hand). Veins may be thrombosed or cord-like.
    *   **"Skin Popping":** Circular, depressed, atrophic scars from subcutaneous injection.
    *   **"Turkey Skin":** Punctate black discoloration (soot tattooing) if the needle was sterilized with a match flame.
*   **Infections:** Abscesses at injection sites, cellulitis, gangrene.
*   **Specific Signs:**
    *   **Crack Thumb:** Callus on the thumb from using butane lighters.
    *   **Burned Lips:** From smoking hot glass pipes (crack cocaine).
    *   **Nasal Septum:** Ulceration or perforation in chronic snorters (Cocaine).

**Internal Findings:**
*   **Lungs:** **[[Pulmonary Edema]]** (heavy, wet lungs) is a common cause of death (froth in airways). Foreign body granulomas (talcosis) if pills were crushed and injected.
*   **Liver:** Chronic hepatitis (Hep B/C), triaditis, enlarged portal lymph nodes.
*   **Heart:** Endocarditis (often right-sided/tricuspid valve), myocardial fibrosis.
*   **Stomach:** May contain packets of drugs (**[[Body Packer Syndrome]]**).

**Sample Collection:**
*   **Blood & Urine:** For toxicology screening.
*   **Bile:** High concentration of narcotics.
*   **Hair:** Can detect long-term/chronic drug use (segmental analysis).
*   **Nasal Swabs:** If snorting is suspected.
*   **Injection Site Tissue:** Excise the needle track for analysis.

### **Medicolegal Aspects**

1.  **[[NDPS Act]] (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985):**
    *   Regulates operations relating to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.
    *   Prohibits production, manufacture, sale, purchase, transport, and consumption unless for medical/scientific purposes.
    *   **Immunity (Section 64-A):** Addicts volunteering for detoxification may be granted immunity from prosecution for small quantity offences (once in a lifetime).
    *   **Punishment:** Varies based on quantity (Small vs. Commercial) ranging from imprisonment (6 months to 20 years) and fines.

2.  **Responsibility:**
    *   **Criminal:** Acts committed under the influence of voluntarily taken drugs are punishable (Section 85 IPC/Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita equivalent).
    *   **Civil:** Contracts made while intoxicated/drugged may be voidable.

3.  **[[Body Packer Syndrome]]:** Smuggling drugs by swallowing packets. Rupture leads to acute massive overdose and death. Medicolegal autopsy must document the number and type of packets.
