# Neoplasms of Salivary Glands

## Introduction and General Principles
Salivary gland neoplasms constitute approximately 3-4% of all head and neck tumors. They can arise from the major salivary glands ([[Parotid gland]], [[Submandibular gland]], [[Sublingual gland]]) or the minor salivary glands scattered throughout the upper aerodigestive tract.

### The Rule of Thumb (Tumor incidence)
There is an inverse relationship between the size of the gland and the probability of malignancy.
*   **Parotid Gland:** 80% are benign; 20% malignant.
*   **Submandibular Gland:** 50–60% are benign; 40–50% malignant.
*   **Sublingual/Minor Salivary Glands:** Only ~20-25% benign; Majority (75-80%) are malignant.

### Classification
The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies these tumors based on origin (Epithelial vs. Mesenchymal).

| Category | Tumor Type |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Benign Epithelial** | • [[Pleomorphic adenoma]] (Most Common)<br>• [[Warthin's tumor]] (Adenolymphoma)<br>• [[Oncocytoma]]<br>• Basal cell adenoma |
| **Benign Mesenchymal** | • [[Hemangioma]] (Most common in children)<br>• Lymphangioma<br>• Lipoma |
| **Malignant Epithelial** | • [[Mucoepidermoid carcinoma]] (Most common malignancy)<br>• [[Adenoid cystic carcinoma]]<br>• Acinic cell carcinoma<br>• Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma<br>• Squamous cell carcinoma<br>• Adenocarcinoma |
| **Malignant Mesenchymal** | • [[Lymphoma]]<br>• Sarcoma |

## Benign Tumors

### 1. Pleomorphic Adenoma (Benign Mixed Tumor)
This is the **most common benign tumor** of salivary glands.
*   **Site:** Parotid (Tail of parotid is most common), Submandibular, Palate (minor glands).
*   **Pathology:**
    *   Called "Mixed tumor" because it contains **epithelial** and **mesenchymal** (stromal) elements.
    *   **Gross:** Encapsulated, smooth, lobulated.
    *   **Microscopy:** Epithelial cells arranged in sheets/strands with a stroma that can be mucoid, myxoid, cartilaginous (chondroid), or osteoid.
*   **Key Feature:** The tumor has a capsule but sends microscopic **pseudopods** into the surrounding normal gland tissue.
*   **Clinical Implications:**
    *   **Enucleation is contraindicated**: Simple shelling out leaves pseudopods behind, leading to high recurrence rates.
    *   **Malignant Transformation**: Long-standing cases may turn into [[Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma]]. Risk increases with duration.
*   **Treatment:** [[Superficial Parotidectomy]] (removal of tumor with a cuff of normal tissue).

### 2. Warthin’s Tumor (Adenolymphoma)
*   **Demographics:** Typically men, 5th–7th decade. Strongly associated with **smokers**.
*   **Site:** Almost exclusively in the **Parotid gland** (Tail). Can be bilateral (10%) or multicentric.
*   **Pathology:**
    *   **Gross:** Encapsulated, often cystic, containing "motor oil" like fluid (mucoid/brownish).
    *   **Microscopy:** Papillary projections lined by double-layered epithelium (oncocytes) with a lymphoid stroma.
*   **Imaging Characteristic:** It is the only tumor that shows up as a **"Hot Nodule"** on Technetium-99m ([[Tc99]]) pertechnetate scan.
*   **Treatment:** Surgical excision/Superficial Parotidectomy.

### 3. Hemangioma
*   **Population:** Most common salivary tumor in **children/infants**.
*   **Features:** Soft, painless, increases in size with crying. Overlying skin may be bluish.
*   **Management:** Often regress spontaneously. Surgery indicated if no regression occurs.

## Malignant Tumors

### 1. Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma
*   **Incidence:** Most common malignant salivary gland tumor in adults and children.
*   **Histology:** Mixture of **mucous-producing cells** and **epidermoid (squamous) cells**.
*   **Grading:**
    *   **Low Grade:** More mucous cells, cystic spaces. Good prognosis (90% survival).
    *   **High Grade:** More solid epidermoid cells. Aggressive, poor prognosis (30% survival).
*   **Treatment:** Parotidectomy (Superficial or Total) +/- Neck dissection for high-grade.

### 2. Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (Cylindroma)
*   **Site:** Most common malignancy of **Submandibular** and **Minor Salivary Glands**.
*   **Histology:** **Cribriform pattern** ("Swiss Cheese" appearance).
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Perineural Invasion:** Tendency to spread along nerves (e.g., Facial nerve). Often presents with pain or palsy.
    *   **Skip Lesions:** Tumor cells "skip" along nerves, making clearance difficult.
    *   **Distant Metastasis:** High rate of metastasis to the **Lungs** and bones, which can occur 10–20 years later.
*   **Treatment:** Radical excision + Postoperative Radiotherapy (Neutron beam therapy is effective).

### 3. Acinic Cell Carcinoma
*   **Origin:** Serous acinar cells.
*   **Behavior:** Low-grade malignancy, slow-growing.
*   **Treatment:** Parotidectomy.

### 4. Malignant Mixed Tumor (Carcinoma ex Pleomorphic Adenoma)
*   **History:** Sudden rapid growth and pain in a long-standing painless lump.
*   **Prognosis:** Very poor.

## Clinical Features

### History
*   **Benign:** Slow-growing, painless mass, mobile, long duration (years).
*   **Malignant:** Rapid growth, pain, fixity to skin/underlying structures, [[Facial nerve palsy]], cervical lymphadenopathy.

### Physical Examination
*   **Parotid:** Swelling lifts the ear lobule.
*   **Deep Lobe Tumors:** May present as a **parapharyngeal mass** pushing the tonsil and soft palate medially.
*   **Bimanual Palpation:** Essential for submandibular and minor gland lesions.

## Investigations

### 1. Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology ([[FNAC]])
*   **Gold Standard** for preoperative diagnosis.
*   Distinguishes benign vs. malignant with high accuracy (~90%).
*   **Note:** Open biopsy is **CONTRAINDICATED** for parotid masses due to risk of fistula formation and tumor seeding.

### 2. Imaging
*   **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):** Investigation of choice.
    *   Best for soft tissue delineation.
    *   Evaluates **deep lobe** extension and **perineural spread**.
    *   T2 weighted images: Pleomorphic adenoma appears hyperintense (bright).
*   **CT Scan:** Useful for evaluating bony erosion (mandible/skull base).
*   **USG (Ultrasound):** Distinguishes solid vs. cystic masses.

## Management

### Surgical Principles
*   **Parotid Gland:**
    *   **Superficial Parotidectomy:** For benign tumors limited to the superficial lobe. Facial nerve is identified and preserved.
    *   **Total Conservative Parotidectomy:** For deep lobe tumors or low-grade malignancies. Nerve is preserved.
    *   **Radical Parotidectomy:** For aggressive malignancies involving the facial nerve. The nerve is sacrificed and grafted.
*   **Submandibular Gland:** Total excision of the gland.

### Adjuvant Therapy
*   **Radiotherapy:** Indicated for high-grade malignancies, positive margins, perineural invasion, or recurrent disease.
*   **Chemotherapy:** Limited role; palliative for distant metastasis.

### Complications of Surgery
1.  **Facial Nerve Palsy:** Temporary (neuropraxia) or permanent.
2.  **[[Frey's Syndrome]] (Gustatory Sweating):**
    *   *Pathophysiology:* Aberrant regeneration of parasympathetic fibers (secretomotor) of the auriculotemporal nerve growing into the sympathetic fibers supplying sweat glands of the skin.
    *   *Symptoms:* Sweating and flushing over the parotid area while eating.
    *   *Test:* Starch-Iodine test.
3.  **Salivary Fistula/Sialocele**.
4.  **Hypesthesia:** Of the ear lobule (Great auricular nerve injury).
