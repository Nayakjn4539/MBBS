# [[DEMOGRAPHY AND FAMILY PLANNING]] > Unmet need for family planning

### Definition
[[Unmet need for family planning]] refers to the percentage of currently married women of reproductive age (15–49 years) who are **fecund** (able to produce children) and **sexually active** but are **not using any method of contraception**, despite wanting to either:
1.  **Delay** the next child (for at least 2 years).
2.  **Stop** childbearing entirely.

### Components of Unmet Need
The concept is divided into two distinct categories based on the reproductive intention:

1.  **Unmet Need for Spacing:** Women who want to delay the next pregnancy for two or more years but are not using contraception. This is highest among younger women (age group 15–24 years).
2.  **Unmet Need for Limiting:** Women who do not want any more children at all but are not using contraception. This is more common in women aged 30 years and above.

### Calculation and Concept
Unmet need is a gap between a woman's **reproductive intentions** and her **contraceptive behavior**.

**Total Demand for Family Planning** is calculated as:
$$Total Demand = Met Need (Current Users) + Unmet Need$$

> **Formula:**
> $$Unmet Need (\%) = \frac{\text{Number of women with unmet need}}{\text{Total number of married women of reproductive age}} \times 100$$

### Current Scenario in India (NFHS-5 Data, 2019-21)
According to the National Family Health Survey-5 data found in the sources:

| Category | Unmet Need Percentage |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Unmet Need** | **9.4%** |
| **Rural Areas** | 9.9% |
| **Urban Areas** | 8.4% |
| **Highest Age Group** | 15–19 years (17.8%) and 20–24 years (17.3%) |

*   There has been a decline in unmet need compared to previous surveys (NFHS-4 was 12.9%), indicating improved access.
*   High fertility states like UP, Bihar, MP, and Rajasthan have a larger proportion of unmet needs.

### Causes of Unmet Need
Barriers that prevent women from using contraception despite not wanting a child:
*   **Lack of Information:** Unawareness about methods or where to get them.
*   **Fear of Side Effects:** Health concerns regarding specific methods.
*   **Access Issues:** Inconvenient or unsatisfactory services.
*   **Opposition:** From husband, family, or community due to cultural/religious beliefs.
*   **Little Perceived Risk:** Wrong perception that they cannot get pregnant (e.g., during breastfeeding or irregular cycles).

### Clinical Relevance & Management
1.  **Population Stabilization:** Addressing unmet need is a primary objective of the [[National Population Policy 2000]] to achieve the replacement level of fertility (TFR = 2.1).
2.  **Maternal Health:** Reducing unmet need prevents unintended pregnancies, thereby reducing maternal mortality and unsafe abortions.
3.  **Counseling Strategy:** Use the **cafeteria approach** (offering a wide basket of choices) and effective counseling techniques like the **GATHER approach** to address fears and misconceptions.

### Mnemonic for Causes of Unmet Need
**"LACK"**
*   **L** - **L**ack of information/access.
*   **A** - **A**ttitude (Opposition from family/husband).
*   **C** - **C**oncerns about health/side effects.
*   **K** - **K**nowledge gap (Perceived low risk of pregnancy).
