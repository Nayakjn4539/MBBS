# [[Mechanical Injuries]] > whiplash Injuries

### Whiplash Injury

**Whiplash injury**, also known as **cervical acceleration-deceleration injury**, is a non-impact soft tissue injury of the cervical spine caused by a sudden jerking movement of the head. It is most commonly associated with rear-end motor vehicle collisions.

#### Mechanism of Injury
The injury occurs due to the transfer of energy to the neck, resulting in a specific sequence of movements:

1.  **Phase of Acceleration ([[Hyperextension]]):**
    *   When a stationary vehicle is struck from behind, the seat pushes the occupant's torso forward.
    *   Due to **inertia**, the heavy head remains behind, causing the neck to hyperextend violently.
    *   This stretches the anterior structures of the neck.

2.  **Phase of Deceleration ([[Hyperflexion]]):**
    *   The head rebounds forward (recoil) or the vehicle stops suddenly.
    *   The chin strikes the chest, causing violent hyperflexion.
    *   This stretches the posterior structures of the neck.

#### Pathological Changes
The damage depends on the phase of movement and the structures involved. The spinal cord may be injured **without** any fracture or dislocation of the vertebrae.

| Feature | **Hyperextension Phase** | **Hyperflexion Phase** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Direction of Force** | Backward snapping of the head | Forward snapping of the head |
| **Primary Structures Injured** | **Anterior** structures | **Posterior** structures |
| **Ligaments** | Rupture of [[Anterior Longitudinal Ligament]] | Tear of [[Nuchal Ligament]], Interspinous ligaments |
| **Muscles** | Strain/tear of [[Sternocleidomastoid]], Scalene, Longus colli | Strain of Trapezius, Posterior cervical muscles |
| **Discs** | Avulsion of [[Intervertebral Disc]] from vertebral body (C5-C6 usually) | Posterior herniation of disc |
| **Bones** | Chip fractures of vertebral bodies | Compression fractures (rare) |

#### Clinical Features
Symptoms often appear after a **latent period** of 12 to 24 hours.
*   **Neck pain:** Dull, aching, worsened by movement.
*   **Stiffness:** Reduced range of motion (especially rotation).
*   **Headache:** Usually occipital, radiating to the forehead.
*   **Neurological symptoms:** Paresthesia (tingling/numbness) in the arms, weakness, or dizziness.
*   **Dysphagia:** Difficulty swallowing due to retropharyngeal edema/hematoma.

#### Autopsy Findings
In fatal cases (usually due to high-velocity impact leading to cord transection), findings may include:

*   **External:** Usually **no external marks** of injury on the neck.
*   **Internal:**
    *   **Muscles:** Deep bruising and hemorrhage in the cervical muscles (sternocleidomastoid, paravertebral muscles).
    *   **Ligaments:** Rupture of the **anterior longitudinal ligament** is a classic finding.
    *   **Spinal Cord:** [[Contusion]] or laceration of the spinal cord.
    *   **Discs:** Rupture of the annulus fibrosus or separation of the disc from the vertebra.
    *   **Brainstem:** In severe cases, avulsion of the brainstem at the pontomedullary junction or lacerations in the pyramids.

#### Medicolegal Aspects
1.  **Railway Spine:** Historically termed "Railway Spine," referring to concussion of the spinal cord seen in railway accidents (and now car collisions) without external evidence of injury to the spine.
2.  **Compensation Claims:** Because symptoms are often subjective (pain, headache) and radiological findings (X-ray/MRI) may be normal in mild cases, this injury is frequently the subject of fraudulent insurance claims or exaggeration ([[Malingering]]).
3.  **Fatalities:** Severe whiplash can cause instant death due to high cervical cord transection or brainstem injury, even without a skull fracture.
4.  **Documentation:** Detailed history of the accident mechanism and precise documentation of subjective symptoms vs objective signs (muscle spasm, reflex changes) is crucial.

**Mnemonic for Symptoms:** **W.H.I.P.**
*   **W** - Wobbly (Dizziness/Vertigo)
*   **H** - Headache/Head can't move (Stiffness)
*   **I** - Inflammation/Injury to ligaments
*   **P** - Pain (Neck/Shoulder) / Paresthesia
