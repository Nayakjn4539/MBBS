# Age-Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD)

**Definition**: [[Age-Related Macular Degeneration]] (ARMD/AMD) is a progressive, non-hereditary degenerative disorder affecting the macula (central retina) in individuals usually older than 50 years. It typically involves the [[choriocapillaris]], [[Bruch's membrane]], and the [[retinal pigment epithelium]] (RPE).

**Epidemiology**:
*   It is the **leading cause of irreversible blindness** in the elderly (developed countries).
*   Prevalence increases significantly with age: affects >25% of people over 75 years.

**Risk Factors** (Mnemonic: **SHADES**)
*   **S**moking (Major modifiable risk factor; increases risk by 2-3x).
*   **H**ypertension / Cardiovascular disease.
*   **A**ge (>50 years).
*   **D**iet (Low intake of antioxidants/zinc/lutein).
*   **E**yes (Light iris color, Hypermetropia, Cataract surgery).
*   **S**unlight exposure (UV radiation) / **S**ex (Females > Males).
*   **Genetics**: Significant association with **Complement Factor H (CFH)** gene and **ARMS2** gene.

### Classification
ARMD is broadly classified into two clinical types:
1.  **Dry ARMD** (Non-exudative / Atrophic / Geographic): 90% of cases.
2.  **Wet ARMD** (Exudative / Neovascular): 10% of cases but responsible for 90% of severe vision loss.

### 1. Dry (Non-Exudative) ARMD

**Pathology**: Characterized by the accumulation of extracellular metabolic debris called **[[Drusen]]** between the [[RPE]] and [[Bruch's membrane]], leading to gradual atrophy of RPE and photoreceptors.

**Clinical Features**:
*   **Symptoms**: 
    *   Gradual, painless diminution of vision (months to years).
    *   Mild [[metamorphopsia]] (distortion of images).
    *   Difficulty reading or seeing fine details.
*   **Signs**:
    1.  **[[Drusen]]**: Small, yellowish-white elevations at the posterior pole.
        *   *Hard Drusen*: Small (<63 $\mu$m), discrete, well-defined edges (harmless).
        *   *Soft Drusen*: Large (>125 $\mu$m), fluffy, ill-defined edges, tend to coalesce (High risk for progression).
    2.  **RPE Abnormalities**: Focal hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation.
    3.  **Geographic Atrophy**: The end-stage of dry ARMD. Sharply demarcated areas of RPE and choriocapillaris loss, through which large choroidal vessels are visible.

**Clinical Implication**: Patients with large soft drusen and pigmentary changes are at high risk of progressing to advanced ARMD or converting to Wet ARMD.

### 2. Wet (Exudative) ARMD

**Pathology**: Characterized by the development of **[[Choroidal Neovascularization]] (CNV)**.
*   New vessels grow from the choriocapillaris through breaks in [[Bruch's membrane]] into the sub-RPE or sub-retinal space.
*   These vessels are fragile and leak fluid, lipid, or blood.

**Clinical Features**:
*   **Symptoms**: 
    *   **Sudden**, painless loss of central vision.
    *   Marked [[metamorphopsia]] (straight lines appear wavy).
    *   Central [[scotoma]] (positive scotoma—patient sees a black spot).
*   **Signs**:
    1.  **Subretinal Hemorrhage/Fluid**: Elevation of the retina.
    2.  **Exudates**: Hard exudates often arranged in a ring around the leaking lesion (Circinate retinopathy).
    3.  **RPE Detachment (PED)**: Sharply defined, dome-shaped elevation.
    4.  **Disciform Scar** (Junius-Kuhnt scar): End-stage fibrotic scar occurring after organization of hemorrhage/exudates resulting in permanent central vision loss.

### Comparison: Dry vs. Wet ARMD

| Feature | Dry ARMD (Non-Neovascular) | Wet ARMD (Neovascular) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Incidence** | Common (90% of cases) | Less Common (10% of cases) |
| **Onset of Vision Loss** | Gradual (Years) | Sudden/Rapid (Days to Weeks) |
| **Severity of Vision Loss**| Mild to Moderate (usually) | Severe |
| **Pathology** | Atrophy of RPE/Photoreceptors | [[Choroidal Neovascularization]] (CNV) |
| **Key Fundus Finding** | **[[Drusen]]** (Yellow spots), Geographic Atrophy | Hemorrhage, Subretinal fluid, Exudates |
| **FFA Appearance** | Window defect (Hyperfluorescence due to atrophy) | Leakage of dye (Hyperfluorescence due to new vessels) |
| **Prognosis** | Better | Poor if untreated |

### Investigations

**1. Amsler Grid Test**: 
*   Simple screening test for home monitoring.
*   Detects **[[metamorphopsia]]** and central scotomas.
*   **Dry ARMD**: May show missing areas.
*   **Wet ARMD**: Shows wavy/distorted lines.

**2. Fundus Fluorescein Angiography ([[FFA]]):**
*   **Dry ARMD**: Shows **Window defect** (Transmission hyperfluorescence) where RPE is atrophied, allowing choroidal fluorescence to shine through without increasing in size.
*   **Wet ARMD**: Used to classify CNV:
    *   **Classic CNV**: Well-defined, lacy hyperfluorescence in early phase with progressive leakage in late phase (Type 2 CNV - subretinal).
    *   **Occult CNV**: Ill-defined leakage or stippled hyperfluorescence (Type 1 CNV - sub-RPE).

**3. Indocyanine Green Angiography ([[ICGA]]):**
*   Better than FFA for visualizing choroidal circulation and **Occult CNV** because ICG dye is protein-bound and does not leak as much as fluorescein.

**4. Optical Coherence Tomography ([[OCT]]):**
*   **Gold Standard** for diagnosis and monitoring response to treatment.
*   **Dry ARMD**: Shows bumps on RPE (Drusen) or thinning of retinal layers.
*   **Wet ARMD**: Shows subretinal fluid (hyporeflective space), intraretinal edema (cysts), and RPE detachment.

### Management

#### Treatment of Dry ARMD
Currently, no curative treatment exists to restore vision lost to atrophy. Management focuses on slowing progression.
*   **Lifestyle Modification**: Cessation of smoking, control of hypertension/lipids.
*   **Antioxidants (AREDS Formula)**: Based on Age-Related Eye Disease Studies. Recommended for Intermediate AMD or Advanced AMD in one eye.
    *   **AREDS 2 Formula** (Current Standard):
        *   [[Vitamin C]] (500 mg)
        *   [[Vitamin E]] (400 IU)
        *   [[Zinc]] (80 mg) + [[Copper]] (2 mg - to prevent anemia from zinc)
        *   [[Lutein]] (10 mg) + [[Zeaxanthin]] (2 mg)
    *   *Note*: **Beta-carotene** (used in AREDS 1) is removed in AREDS 2 because it increases the risk of lung cancer in smokers.
*   **Low Vision Aids**: Magnifiers, telescopes for reading.

#### Treatment of Wet ARMD
The goal is to stop leakage and destroy new vessels.
**1. Anti-VEGF Therapy (First Line / Gold Standard):**
*   Inhibits **Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor** (VEGF), which drives neovascularization.
*   Administered via **Intravitreal Injection** (into the vitreous cavity).
*   **Drugs**:
    *   **[[Bevacizumab]]** (Avastin): Off-label, cost-effective.
    *   **[[Ranibizumab]]** (Lucentis): FDA approved monoclonal antibody fragment.
    *   **[[Aflibercept]]** (Eylea): VEGF Trap, longer duration of action.
    *   **Brolucizumab**.
*   *Regimen*: Usually monthly injections initially, followed by "Treat and Extend" or "PRN" (pro re nata) based on OCT findings.

**2. Photodynamic Therapy ([[PDT]]):**
*   Uses a photosensitive dye **[[Verteporfin]]** injected IV, which accumulates in the CNV.
*   Activated by a non-thermal laser (689 nm) to cause thrombosis of the abnormal vessels while sparing normal retina.
*   *Indication*: Mainly for specific subtypes like Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (PCV) or when Anti-VEGF is contraindicated/ineffective.

**3. Laser Photocoagulation:**
*   Thermal laser (Argon green) to burn the CNV.
*   *Limitation*: Causes a permanent blind spot (scotoma). Only used for **extra-foveal** CNV (away from central vision). Rarely used now.
