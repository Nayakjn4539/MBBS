# [[Sports Injuries]] > Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (Phalen's and Tinel's)

# [[Carpal Tunnel Syndrome]] (CTS)

**[[Carpal Tunnel Syndrome]]** is the most common compressive neuropathy in the upper extremity. It is caused by the entrapment or compression of the [[median nerve]] as it passes deep to the [[flexor retinaculum]] (transverse carpal ligament) at the wrist.

### Surgical Anatomy: The "Tunnel"
The carpal tunnel is a fibro-osseous canal defined by:
*   **Floor and Walls:** The carpal bones (osseous arch).
*   **Roof:** The [[transverse carpal ligament]] (flexor retinaculum).
*   **Contents:** "9 Tendons and 1 Nerve".
    *   4 tendons of [[flexor digitorum superficialis]] (FDS).
    *   4 tendons of [[flexor digitorum profundus]] (FDP).
    *   1 tendon of [[flexor pollicis longus]] (FPL).
    *   The [[median nerve]].

### Etiology (Causes)
Any condition that decreases the size of the tunnel or increases the volume of its contents can cause CTS. While often **idiopathic**, specific causes include:

**Mnemonic: PRAGMATIC**
*   **P**regnancy (fluid retention)
*   **R**heumatoid arthritis (synovitis)
*   **A**rthritis (degenerative/osteoarthritis of carpal bones)
*   **G**rowth hormone abnormalities ([[Acromegaly]])
*   **M**etabolic (Gout, Diabetes, Myxedema/Hypothyroidism)
*   **A**lcoholism
*   **T**umors (Ganglion, lipoma)
*   **I**diopathic (Most common)
*   **C**onnective tissue disorders (Amyloidosis)

*Clinical Implication:* In the context of sports, repetitive wrist flexion/extension or direct trauma (e.g., cyclists leaning on handlebars, though this more commonly affects the ulnar nerve) can precipitate symptoms. Malunited [[Colles' fracture]] is a common post-traumatic cause.

### Clinical Features
*   **Demographics:** Common in middle-aged females (M:F = 1:3).
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Pain and Paraesthesia:** Tingling, numbness, or burning sensation in the [[median nerve]] distribution (thumb, index, middle, and radial half of the ring finger).
    *   **Nocturnal Pain:** A hallmark feature. Patients often wake up at night with burning pain.
    *   **Relieving Factor:** The patient often hangs the arm over the bed or shakes the hand to get relief. This is known as the **"Flick Sign"**.
    *   **Clumsiness:** Difficulty in performing fine movements (e.g., buttoning a shirt, sewing).
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Sensory Loss:** Hypoaesthesia in the lateral 3½ digits.
    *   **Motor Wasting:** In late stages, wasting of the [[thenar eminence]] (thenar muscles) occurs.
    *   **Motor Weakness:** Weakness of thumb abduction (specifically [[abductor pollicis brevis]]).

### Clinical Examination: Special Tests

#### 1. Phalen's Test
This is a provocative test used to reproduce the patient's symptoms.
*   **Procedure:** The patient is asked to hold the wrist in complete **flexion** (90 degrees) for 60 seconds (1 minute). This can be done by pushing the dorsum of both hands against each other.
*   **Mechanism:** Flexion increases the pressure within the carpal tunnel, compressing the [[median nerve]] between the proximal edge of the transverse carpal ligament and the radius.
*   **Interpretation:** The test is **Positive** if the patient experiences tingling, numbness, or pain in the median nerve distribution (thumb, index, middle fingers) within 60 seconds.

#### 2. Reverse Phalen's Test (Prayer Test)
*   **Procedure:** The patient extends both wrists by placing palms together (prayer position) for 1 minute.
*   **Interpretation:** Positive if paresthesia occurs in the median nerve distribution.

#### 3. Tinel's Sign
This tests for nerve irritability or regeneration.
*   **Procedure:** The examiner gently **percusses (taps)** over the [[median nerve]] at the wrist (proximal to the carpal tunnel).
*   **Interpretation:** The test is **Positive** if the patient feels a sensation of "electric shock," tingling, or pins and needles radiating distally into the fingers supplied by the median nerve.
*   *Note:* This sign is seen in only about 45% of cases.

#### 4. Durkan's Test (Median Nerve Compression Test)
*   **Procedure:** Direct pressure is applied with the thumbs over the median nerve at the carpal tunnel for 30 seconds.
*   **Clinical Significance:** It is considered the **most sensitive/best clinical test** for CTS.

#### 5. Tourniquet Test
*   **Procedure:** Inflating a pneumatic tourniquet above systolic blood pressure may reproduce symptoms due to ischemia.

### Investigations
*   **Electrodiagnostic Studies (Gold Standard):**
    *   **[[Nerve Conduction Velocity]] (NCV):** Shows slowing of conduction across the wrist (increased latency).
    *   **[[Electromyography]] (EMG):** Shows denervation potentials (fibrillations) in thenar muscles in advanced cases.
*   **X-rays:** Usually normal, but useful to rule out bony pathology like old fractures or arthritis.
*   **Ultrasound/MRI:** Can show nerve swelling or space-occupying lesions (e.g., ganglion).

### Treatment

#### Conservative Management
Indicated for mild cases, intermittent symptoms, or reversible causes (e.g., pregnancy).
1.  **Splinting:** A **Wrist Cock-up Splint** (or night splint) keeps the wrist in neutral or slight extension to prevent flexion during sleep.
2.  **Medications:** NSAIDs, Diuretics (for fluid retention), Vitamin B6.
3.  **Local Injection:** Corticosteroid injection into the carpal tunnel.

#### Surgical Management
Indicated if conservative treatment fails, there is thenar wasting, or fixed sensory loss.
*   **Procedure:** **Carpal Tunnel Release** (surgical division of the [[transverse carpal ligament]]/flexor retinaculum).
*   **Methods:** Can be done via Open release or Endoscopic release.
