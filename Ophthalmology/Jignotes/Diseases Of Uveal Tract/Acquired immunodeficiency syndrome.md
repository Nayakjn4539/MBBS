# Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in Uveal Diseases

[[Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome]] (AIDS) is a multisystem disorder caused by the [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus]] (HIV), characterized by profound immunosuppression. Ocular involvement is extremely common, occurring in up to **75%** of patients,.

### Pathogenesis
The primary pathology involves the depletion of **CD4+ T-helper cells**, leading to a breakdown of immune surveillance. Ocular lesions result from:
1.  Direct toxic effect of HIV on vascular endothelium (Microangiopathy).
2.  Deposition of immune complexes.
3.  Opportunistic infections due to depressed cell-mediated immunity.
4.  Neoplasms secondary to immunodeficiency.

### Classification of Ocular Manifestations

The ocular manifestations in the context of uveal and retinal diseases can be broadly classified as follows:

| Category | Specific Conditions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Non-infectious (Microvasculopathy)** | [[Retinal Microangiopathy]] (Cotton wool spots, hemorrhages) |
| **Opportunistic Infections (Viral)** | [[Cytomegalovirus Retinitis]], [[Acute Retinal Necrosis]], [[Progressive Outer Retinal Necrosis]] |
| **Opportunistic Infections (Parasitic)** | [[Toxoplasmosis]], [[Pneumocystis carinii]] choroiditis |
| **Opportunistic Infections (Fungal)** | [[Cryptococcus neoformans]], [[Candida]], [[Histoplasmosis]] |
| **Neoplasms** | [[Kaposi Sarcoma]], [[Intraocular Lymphoma]] |
| **Iatrogenic/Recovery** | [[Immune Recovery Uveitis]] (IRU) |

### 1. HIV Retinal Microangiopathy
This is the **most common** ocular manifestation of AIDS. It is usually non-infectious and asymptomatic.

*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **[[Cotton Wool Spots]] (CWS):** Seen in 50% of cases. These are infarcts of the nerve fiber layer.
    *   **Retinal Hemorrhages:** Superficial (flame-shaped) and deep (dot and blot).
    *   **Microaneurysms:** Located at the posterior pole.
*   **Pathogenesis:** Likely due to immune complex deposition or direct viral infection of the endothelium.
*   **Clinical Implication:** CWS in AIDS usually resolve spontaneously. However, they indicate a disruption of the blood-retinal barrier and are often a marker of disease severity.

### 2. Opportunistic Infections

#### A. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Retinitis
This is the **most common secondary infection** and the leading cause of visual loss in AIDS patients. It typically occurs when the **CD4+ count falls below 50 cells/mm³**.

*   **Clinical Patterns:**
    1.  **Fulminant/Hemorrhagic Type:** Characterized by dense, white, geographical areas of retinal necrosis along vascular arcades with associated hemorrhage.
        *   **Classic Sign:** **[[Pizza Pie Appearance]]** or **"Sauce and Cheese Retinopathy"** (yellow-white exudates representing cheese and hemorrhages representing sauce),.
    2.  **Indolent/Granular Type:** Peripheral granular opacities with minimal hemorrhage. Spreads slowly in a "brush-fire" fashion.
    3.  **Frosted Branch Angiitis:** Severe perivascular sheathing.
*   **Complications:** [[Retinal Detachment]] (up to 30%), [[Optic Atrophy]].
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Systemic: Intravenous **[[Ganciclovir]]**, **[[Foscarnet]]**, or **[[Cidofovir]]**.
    *   Local: Intravitreal Ganciclovir implants or injections.

#### B. Viral Necrotizing Retinitis (Non-CMV)
Caused by [[Varicella Zoster Virus]] (VZV) or [[Herpes Simplex Virus]] (HSV).
1.  **[[Acute Retinal Necrosis]] (ARN):**
    *   Can occur in immunocompetent or immunocompromised patients.
    *   Peripheral necrotizing retinitis + Occlusive arteritis + Significant **Vitritis**.
2.  **[[Progressive Outer Retinal Necrosis]] (PORN):**
    *   Specific to patients with profound immunosuppression (AIDS).
    *   Rapidly coalescing necrosis of the outer retina.
    *   **Key Feature:** Minimal or **no vitritis** (due to lack of immune response) and early involvement of the posterior pole,.

#### C. Pneumocystis Carinii Choroiditis
*   **Causative Agent:** *Pneumocystis jirovecii* (formerly *carinii*).
*   **Appearance:** Multifocal, flat, yellow-round choroidal lesions located behind the equator.
*   **Association:** Often seen in patients receiving aerosolized pentamidine prophylaxis (which protects the lungs but does not reach the eye).

#### D. Toxoplasmosis
*   Usually a reactivation of congenital cysts.
*   **Appearance:** Focal necrotizing retinochoroiditis. In AIDS, the classic "Headlight in Fog" appearance (vitritis) may be absent or less distinct because the inflammatory response is poor.
*   **Lesions:** Can be multifocal, bilateral, and mimic CMV retinitis.

#### E. Fungal Infections
*   **[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]:** The most common fungal infection in AIDS. Causes choroiditis (creamy lesions) without vitritis. Associated with meningitis.
*   **[[Candida albicans]]:** Chorioretinitis with "puff-ball" vitreous exudates ("String of Pearls").
*   **[[Histoplasmosis]]:** Can cause endophthalmitis or isolated choroidal granulomas.

### 3. Immune Recovery Uveitis (IRU)
This condition arises *after* the initiation of **[[Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy]] (HAART)**.

*   **Mechanism:** As the immune system recovers (CD4 count rises), the body mounts an inflammatory response against latent antigens (like CMV) that were previously ignored.
*   **Clinical Features:** Paradoxical worsening of intraocular inflammation, [[Vitritis]], [[Cystoid Macular Edema]] (CME), and epiretinal membrane formation.
*   **Management:** Anti-inflammatory therapy (Corticosteroids) alongside continued HAART.

---

### 4. Neoplasms (Masquerade Syndromes)
*   **[[Kaposi Sarcoma]]:** A vascular tumor caused by HHV-8. Appears as a bluish-red, elevated nodule on the eyelids or conjunctiva. It mimics a subconjunctival hemorrhage.
*   **[[Primary Intraocular Lymphoma]]:** Large cell lymphoma (Non-Hodgkin's). Can present as chronic uveitis refractory to steroids,.

---

### 5. Neuro-Ophthalmic Manifestations
*   Cranial nerve palsies (III, IV, VI) leading to ophthalmoplegia.
*   Optic neuropathy and Papilledema (secondary to cryptococcal meningitis or CNS lymphoma).

---

### Investigation & Management Summary

**Diagnostic Approach:**
*   **Serology:** CD4+ counts, HIV viral load.
*   **Fundus Examination:** Dilated exam to rule out CMV/PORN.
*   **PCR:** Analysis of aqueous or vitreous tap for specific viral DNA (CMV, VZV, HSV, Toxoplasma),.

**Treatment Principles:**
1.  **Systemic Control:** **[[HAART]]** is the cornerstone. It reduces opportunistic infections and improves survival.
2.  **Specific Antimicrobials:**
    *   *CMV:* Valganciclovir (oral), Ganciclovir (IV/Intravitreal).
    *   *Toxoplasma:* Pyrimethamine + Sulfadiazine + Folinic acid.
    *   *Pneumocystis:* Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (IV).
    *   *Fungal:* Amphotericin B, Fluconazole.

**Clinical Implication:**
In a drug abuser, **chronic iridocyclitis** and **anterior vitritis** that do not respond to steroid therapy should arouse suspicion of HIV infection.
