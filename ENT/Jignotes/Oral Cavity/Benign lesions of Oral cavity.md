### Solid Benign Tumors

#### 1. Squamous Papilloma
*   **Etiology:** Usually associated with **Human Papillomavirus ([[HPV]])** subtypes 6 and 11.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Common in 3rd to 5th decades.
    *   **Site:** Soft/Hard palate, uvula, tongue, lips.
    *   **Appearance:** Pedunculated, white, warty (verrucous) surface (cauliflower-like). Usually < 1 cm.
*   **Treatment:** Surgical excision or ablation with [[CO2 Laser]]. Recurrence is rare.

#### 2. Fibroma (Irritation Fibroma/Fibroepithelial Polyp)
*   **Etiology:** Reactive hyperplasia due to chronic irritation (e.g., cheek bite, sharp tooth) rather than a true neoplasm.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Site:** Buccal mucosa (along the bite line), tongue, labial mucosa.
    *   **Appearance:** Smooth, pink (mucosa-covered), sessile or pedunculated, firm consistency.
*   **Treatment:** Conservative surgical excision.

#### 3. Hemangioma
*   **Types:** Capillary (more common) or Cavernous.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Mostly seen in children; congenital lesions often regress.
    *   **Site:** Lips, tongue, buccal mucosa.
    *   **Appearance:** Soft, painless, red or blue mass. Blanches on pressure.
    *   **Phlebectasia:** Dilated veins seen in older adults (caviar tongue).
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Observation (for spontaneous involution in children).
    *   Active treatment for persistent/growing lesions: [[Microembolization]], Cryotherapy, Laser, or Sclerotherapy.

#### 4. Lymphangioma
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Site:** Anterior 2/3rd of the [[Tongue]] (most common).
    *   **Appearance:** Can cause diffuse macroglossia or localized "frog-spawn" appearance (pebbly surface). Soft and compressible.
*   **Treatment:** Surgical excision. Complete excision is difficult; partial excision is done to reduce bulk.

#### 5. Pyogenic Granuloma
*   **Etiology:** Reactive inflammatory hyperplasia in response to trauma or hormonal changes (e.g., **Pregnancy Tumor** or [[Pregnancy Granuloma]]).
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Site:** Anterior [[Gingiva]] (most common), lips, tongue.
    *   **Appearance:** Soft, reddish-purple, pedunculated/sessile, **bleeds easily** on touch.
*   **Treatment:** Surgical excision. Recurrence is rare if excised completely.

#### 6. Torus (Exostosis)
*   **Definition:** Non-neoplastic bony outgrowth.
*   **Types:**
    *   **[[Torus Palatinus]]:** Midline of the hard palate.
    *   **[[Torus Mandibularis]]:** Lingual surface of mandible (premolar region), usually bilateral.
*   **Clinical Implications:** Usually innocuous. Removal indicated only if they interfere with denture fitting or speech.

#### 7. Granular Cell Tumor (Myoblastoma)
*   **Origin:** Derived from **Schwann cells** (neural origin).
*   **Site:** Tongue (most common).
*   **Appearance:** Firm, submucosal nodule.
*   **Histology:** Overlying epithelium shows **pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia** (can be mistaken for SCC).
*   **Treatment:** Excision.

### Cystic Lesions

#### 1. Mucocele
*   **Definition:** Retention cyst of minor salivary glands.
*   **Etiology:** Trauma to the duct (extravasation type) or duct obstruction (retention type).
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Site:** **Lower Lip** is the most common site.
    *   **Appearance:** Soft, cystic, bluish, transparent swelling.
*   **Treatment:** Surgical excision of the cyst along with the underlying minor salivary gland to prevent recurrence.

#### 2. Ranula
*   **Definition:** Cystic lesion in the floor of the mouth arising from the **[[Sublingual Salivary Gland]]**.
*   **Appearance:** Unilateral, bluish, translucent swelling resembling a **frog's belly**.
*   **Types:**
    1.  **Simple Ranula:** Confined to the floor of the mouth (above mylohyoid).
    2.  **[[Plunging Ranula]]:** Herniates through the mylohyoid muscle into the neck (submandibular/submental space).
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Small: Excision.
    *   Large/Plunging: Excision of the cyst **along with the sublingual gland** (to prevent recurrence). Marsupialization has high recurrence rates.

#### 3. Dermoid Cyst
*   **Pathology:** Developmental cyst containing skin appendages (hair, sweat glands).
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Sublingual Dermoid:** Above mylohyoid; pushes tongue up. Median or lateral.
    *   **Submental Dermoid:** Below mylohyoid; presents as double chin.
    *   **Differentiating feature:** Opaque/white mass (unlike translucent Ranula) and doughy consistency.
*   **Treatment:** Surgical excision.

### Premalignant Lesions (Potentially Malignant Disorders)

#### 1. Leukoplakia
*   **Definition:** A white patch that cannot be rubbed off and cannot be characterized clinically or pathologically as any other disease. Diagnosis of exclusion.
*   **Etiology:** Tobacco (smoking/chewing), Alcohol, Friction.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Homogenous:** Smooth/wrinkled white patch (lower risk).
    *   **Non-homogenous (Speckled/Erosive/Nodular):** High risk of malignancy.
    *   **Proliferative Verrucous Leukoplakia:** High risk, resistant to treatment.
*   **Malignant Potential:** 1–17.5% (Avg 5%). Higher risk if on **floor of mouth** or **ventral tongue**.
*   **Management:** Biopsy to rule out dysplasia/carcinoma. Cessation of habits. Surgical excision/Laser ablation for dysplastic lesions.

#### 2. Erythroplakia
*   **Definition:** A red velvety patch that cannot be characterized as another disease.
*   **Significance:** Much higher malignant potential than leukoplakia (severe dysplasia or Carcinoma in situ often present at diagnosis).
*   **Management:** Excision biopsy.

#### 3. Oral Submucous Fibrosis (OSMF)
*   **Etiology:** Chronic chewing of **Areca nut (Betel nut)** containing arecoline.
*   **Pathology:** Fibroelastic transformation of connective tissue.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Burning sensation on eating spicy food (early sign).
    *   **Trismus** (progressive inability to open mouth) due to fibrous bands.
    *   Blanched, marble-like mucosa.
    *   Stiff tongue and soft palate.
*   **Treatment:** Stop habit. Intralesional steroids/hyaluronidase. Surgical release for severe trismus.

#### 4. Lichen Planus
*   **Etiology:** Autoimmune T-cell mediated.
*   **Forms:**
    *   **Reticular:** Wickham's striae (lace-like pattern), asymptomatic.
    *   **Erosive:** Painful ulcers, potential for malignancy.
*   **Treatment:** Topical steroids for erosive form.

### Miscellaneous & Tumor-like Conditions

| **Condition** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Geographic Tongue]]** | Migratory glossitis. Erythematous patches with white borders. Map-like appearance. Asymptomatic. |
| **[[Median Rhomboid Glossitis]]** | Red depapillated patch in midline dorsum of tongue (anterior to circumvallate papillae). Associated with *Candida*. |
| **[[Fordyce Spots]]** | Ectopic **sebaceous glands**. Yellowish granules on buccal mucosa/lips. Normal variant. |
| **[[Hairy Tongue]]** | Hypertrophy of filiform papillae. Stained brown/black (tobacco/chromogenic bacteria). |
| **[[Torus Palatinus]]** | Bony exostosis in the midline of hard palate. |

### Clinical Implications
*   **The Rule of Biopsy:** Any ulcer or lesion in the oral cavity persisting for more than **3 weeks** despite conservative treatment mandates a biopsy to rule out malignancy.
*   **Danger Areas:** Leukoplakia on the **floor of the mouth** and **ventral surface of the tongue** has the highest risk of malignant transformation ("Coffin corner" of the mouth).
*   **Plunging Ranula:** Always differentiate a submandibular neck swelling from a plunging ranula or lymphadenopathy. A ranula is translucent and non-tender unless infected.

**Mnemonic for Premalignant Lesions:** **LES**s **P**robable to heal
*   **L**eukoplakia
*   **E**rythroplakia (Highest risk)
*   **S**ubmucous Fibrosis
*   **P**lanus (Lichen Planus - erosive type)
