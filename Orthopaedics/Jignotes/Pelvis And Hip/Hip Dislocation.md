# [[Pelvis And Hip]] > Hip Dislocation

### Hip Dislocation

[[Hip dislocation]] is an orthopedic emergency defined as the total loss of contact between the femoral head and the acetabulum. The [[hip joint]] is a ball and socket joint with inherent stability provided by the deep acetabular socket, the strong capsule, and the [[iliofemoral ligament]] (Y ligament of Bigelow). Consequently, considerable force is required to dislocate it.

### Classification
Dislocations are classified based on the relationship of the femoral head to the acetabulum.

1.  **[[Posterior hip dislocation]]:** Most common type (70–80% of cases).
2.  **[[Anterior hip dislocation]]:** Less common (10–15% of cases).
3.  **[[Central dislocation of hip]]:** Rare; actually a fracture of the acetabulum where the femoral head is driven medially.

### Posterior Hip Dislocation

#### Mechanism of Injury
*   **Dashboard Injury:** Occurs most commonly in high-velocity road traffic accidents. The occupant is thrown forward, and the knee strikes the dashboard while the hip is flexed and adducted. The force is transmitted up the femoral shaft, driving the head posteriorly out of the socket.
*   **Force:** Considerable force is required. Can also occur due to a fall from a height.

#### Clinical Features
*   **Pain:** Severe pain in the hip region.
*   **Loss of Function:** Patient is unable to move the limb.
*   **Attitude of the Limb:** The limb is held in **Flexion, Adduction, and Internal Rotation** (FADIR).
*   **Shortening:** There is apparent shortening of the limb.
*   **Palpation:** The [[femoral head]] may be palpable in the gluteal region.

**Mnemonic for Posterior Dislocation Attitude:**
**P**osterior = **P**udding (leg is turned in/internal rotation) or **FADIR** (Flexion, Adduction, Internal Rotation).

#### Classification Systems
**Thompson and Epstein Classification:**
*   **Type I:** Simple dislocation with or without insignificant posterior wall fragment.
*   **Type II:** Dislocation with a single large posterior wall fragment.
*   **Type III:** Dislocation with a comminuted posterior wall fragment.
*   **Type IV:** Dislocation with fracture of the acetabular floor.
*   **Type V:** Dislocation with fracture of the [[femoral head]].

**Pipkin’s Classification (Femoral Head Fractures with Dislocation):**
*   **Type I:** Fracture caudad (below) to the fovea centralis.
*   **Type II:** Fracture cephalad (above) to the fovea centralis.
*   **Type III:** Type I or II with associated fracture of the [[femoral neck]].
*   **Type IV:** Type I or II with associated fracture of the [[acetabulum]].

#### Imaging
*   **X-ray (AP Pelvis):**
    *   Femoral head lies outside and usually above the acetabulum.
    *   [[Shenton’s line]] is broken.
    *   Lesser trochanter is not visible due to internal rotation.
*   **CT Scan:** Essential to assess concentric reduction, intra-articular fragments, and acetabular fractures.

### Anterior Hip Dislocation

#### Mechanism of Injury
*   Forced abduction and external rotation of the hip.
*   Occurs when the knee strikes the dashboard with the thigh abducted, or due to a fall from a height, or a blow to the back while in a squatted position.

#### Classification (Epstein)
*   **Type I (Superior/Pubic):** Head located in the pubic region (Hip extended and externally rotated).
*   **Type II (Inferior/Obturator):** Head located in the obturator region (Hip flexed, abducted, and externally rotated).

#### Clinical Features
*   **Attitude of the Limb:** The limb is held in **Flexion, Abduction, and External Rotation** (FABER).
*   **Length:** There may be apparent lengthening of the limb.
*   **Palpation:** The head is palpable in the groin (femoral triangle).
*   **Vascular Sign of Narath:** Inability to palpate the femoral artery against the femoral head (positive in anterior dislocation).

### Management

**Clinical Implication:** Hip dislocation is an orthopedic emergency. Reduction must be performed within **6–12 hours** to reduce the risk of [[avascular necrosis]] (AVN).

#### 1. Closed Reduction
Performed under general anesthesia with muscle relaxation.

| Method | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Allis maneuver]]** | Most common. Patient supine. Assistant stabilizes pelvis. Surgeon flexes hip and knee to 90°, applies axial traction, and gently rotates the thigh. A "click" indicates reduction. |
| **[[Stimson’s gravity method]]** | Patient prone with leg hanging off the table edge. Assistant stabilizes pelvis. Surgeon applies downward pressure on the calf. Gravity aids reduction. |
| **[[Bigelow’s method]]** | Uses the iliofemoral ligament as a fulcrum. Limb is lifted, abducted, and externally rotated (for posterior dislocation). *Caution: High risk of iatrogenic fracture*. |
| **Classical Watson-Jones** | For both anterior and posterior. Limb brought to neutral, followed by longitudinal traction. |

#### 2. Open Reduction
**Indications:**
*   Failed closed reduction.
*   Interposition of soft tissue (capsule, labrum, or piriformis tendon).
*   Intra-articular loose bone fragments (preventing concentric reduction).
*   Associated fractures requiring internal fixation (e.g., femoral neck fracture).

#### 3. Post-Reduction Care
*   Confirm concentric reduction with X-ray and CT.
*   **Immobilization:** Skin or skeletal traction (e.g., in a Thomas splint) for 3–6 weeks to allow soft tissue healing.
*   Mobilization: Gradual weight-bearing after the immobilization period.

### Complications

#### Early Complications
*   **[[Sciatic nerve]] Injury:** Occurs in 10–20% of posterior dislocations. Usually neuropraxia of the peroneal division causing [[foot drop]]. Recovery is variable.
*   **Vascular Injury:** Injury to femoral vessels in anterior dislocation.
*   **Associated Fractures:** Acetabulum, femoral head, or femoral neck fractures.
*   **Irreducible Dislocation:** Due to "buttonholing" of the head through the capsule or soft tissue interposition.

#### Late Complications
*   **[[Avascular necrosis]] (AVN):** Occurs due to damage to the retinacular vessels or ligamentum teres artery. Risk increases with delay in reduction (>6 hours).
*   **[[Post-traumatic osteoarthritis]]:** Secondary to cartilage damage or AVN.
*   **[[Myositis ossificans]]:** Heterotopic ossification in muscles around the hip, common after open reduction or severe muscle injury.
*   **Recurrent Dislocation:** Rare, usually due to unhealed capsule or acetabular defects.
