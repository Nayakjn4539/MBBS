# [[NUTRITION AND HEALTH]] > Zinc is given with ORS in treatment of Diarrhoea

### Role of Zinc in Diarrhea Management

**Zinc supplementation** is a critical component of the [[National Diarrhoeal Disease Control Programme]] and is recommended by the WHO and UNICEF as an adjunct to [[Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS)]] for managing acute diarrhea in children.

### 1. Rationale
Diarrhea leads to a significant loss of zinc from the body. Zinc deficiency compromises the [[immune system]], reduces mucosal integrity, and increases the risk of new infections. Supplementation helps replenish these stores and boosts recovery.

### 2. Dosage and Administration Guidelines
The Government of India and WHO recommend giving **Zinc Dispersible Tablets** for a duration of **14 days**, starting from the first day of treatment.

| Age Group | Dosage | Administration Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Infants 2 months to 6 months** | **10 mg** (1/2 tablet) once daily | Dissolve in a small amount of expressed breast milk, ORS, or clean water in a spoon/cup. |
| **Children > 6 months** | **20 mg** (1 tablet) once daily | Tablet can be chewed or dissolved in a small amount of clean water or breast milk. |

**Important Note:**
*   Treatment should continue for the full **14 days** even if diarrhea stops earlier.
*   **Zinc-fortified ORS** is **NOT** recommended because the intake of ORS varies by child, making it difficult to standardize the zinc dosage.

### 3. Benefits of Zinc Supplementation
According to clinical studies and national guidelines, Zinc acts as a "treatment" for the current episode and a "prophylaxis" for the future.

*   **Reduces Duration:** Significantly shortens the length of the acute diarrheal episode.
*   **Reduces Severity:** Decreases the volume and frequency of stools.
*   **Prevents Recurrence:** Lowers the incidence of subsequent diarrhea and pneumonia episodes for the following **2 to 3 months** by boosting immunity,.
*   **Reduces Mortality:** Decreases child mortality by 3–5%.
*   **Reduces Drug Misuse:** Substantially reduces the unwarranted use of antibiotics during acute diarrhea.

### 4. Mechanism of Action
*   **Immune function:** Zinc is essential for maintaining the integrity of the immune system and gene regulation within lymphocytes.
*   **Mucosal repair:** It aids in the regeneration of the intestinal epithelium and improves the absorption of water and electrolytes.

### 5. Clinical Relevance: The "4 Rules" of Home Treatment
In the [[Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness (IMNCI)]], mothers are counseled on 4 main rules for home management of diarrhea (Plan A):
1.  Give **Extra Fluid** (ORS, home fluids).
2.  Give **Zinc Supplements** (for 14 days).
3.  **Continue Feeding** (never withhold food).
4.  Know **When to Return** (danger signs).

### Mnemonic
To remember the benefits of Zinc in Diarrhea: **"Zinc S.T.O.P.S Diarrhea"**

*   **S** - **S**everity reduced.
*   **T** - **T**ime (Duration) reduced.
*   **O** - **O**ffers protection for 2-3 months (prevention of recurrence).
*   **P** - **P**revents Antibiotic misuse.
*   **S** - **S**urvival increased (Reduced Mortality).
