# [[Concept Of Health And Disease]] > Determinants of Health

### Determinants of Health

Health is **multifactorial**. It is not merely the result of medical care but is influenced by a complex interaction of factors lying both within the individual and externally in the society. These factors are collectively known as the [[Determinants of Health]].

### 1. Biological Determinants
The physical and mental traits of every human being are determined by the nature of their **genes** at the moment of [[conception]].
*   **Genetic Constitution:** This is unique and unalterable.
*   **Genetic Diseases:** Chromosomal anomalies, errors of metabolism, mental retardation, and some types of diabetes.
*   **Positive Health:** Implies that a person should be able to express their genetic potentiality as completely as possible within a healthy environment.

### 2. Behavioral and Socio-cultural Conditions (Lifestyle)
The term "Lifestyle" denotes "the way people live," reflecting social values, attitudes, and activities.
*   **Learned Behavior:** Lifestyles are learnt through socialization with parents, peer groups, and mass media.
*   **Risk Factors:** Many modern health problems (Coronary Heart Disease, Obesity, Lung Cancer) are associated with lifestyle changes such as:
    *   [[Smoking]] and Alcoholism.
    *   Lack of physical exercise.
    *   Poor nutrition/Junk food.
*   **Cultural Factors:** Customs and traditions can be health-promoting (e.g., breastfeeding, personal hygiene) or harmful (e.g., restrictive diet during pregnancy, child marriages).

### 3. Environment
Disease is often defined as a "maladjustment of the human organism to the environment."
*   **Internal Environment:** Tissues, organs, and systems functioning harmoniously (Domain of Internal Medicine).
*   **External (Macro) Environment:** All that is external to the individual human host.
    *   **Physical:** Air, water, soil, housing, climate, radiation. (e.g., [[Air Pollution]], Water-borne diseases).
    *   **Biological:** Bacteria, viruses, insects, rodents, animals (Reservoirs and Vectors).
    *   **Psychosocial:** Cultural values, customs, habits, beliefs, attitudes, religion, lifestyle, and social organization.

### 4. Socio-economic Conditions
For the majority of the world, health status is determined primarily by the level of socio-economic development.
*   **Economic Status:** [[GNP]] (Gross National Product) and per capita income determine purchasing power, standard of living, and quality of life. Poverty is the greatest threat to health.
*   **Education:** Especially **female literacy**, is heavily correlated with health indicators like [[IMR]] (Infant Mortality Rate). Education enables people to understand health problems and utilize services.
*   **Occupation:** Employment promotes health; unemployment leads to psychological and social damage. Occupational hazards also pose specific risks.
*   **Political System:** Decisions on resource allocation, manpower policy, and equity are political decisions. The % of GNP spent on health indicates political commitment.

### 5. Health Services
The purpose of [[Health Services]] is to improve the health status of the population.
*   **Scope:** Covers treatment of disease, prevention of illness, and promotion of health.
*   **Effectiveness:** Services must be:
    *   Reaching the social periphery.
    *   Equitably distributed.
    *   Accessible and affordable.
    *   Socially acceptable.
*   **Example:** [[Immunization]] of children can directly influence the prevalence of vaccine-preventable diseases; safe water can prevent cholera/typhoid.

### 6. Ageing of the Population
*   A major concern is the rapid increase in the population aged 60 and over.
*   **Health Implication:** Increased prevalence of chronic diseases and disabilities (e.g., [[Hypertension]], Dementia) requiring special geriatric care.

### 7. Gender
*   Women's health issues have gained priority (Global Commission on Women’s Health, 1993).
*   **Inequality:** Women often face unequal access to nutrition, education, and healthcare due to social stratification, leading to issues like nutritional anemia and high [[Maternal Mortality Rate]].

### 8. Other Determinants
*   **Science and Technology:** Can be a double-edged sword. While providing newer cures (medical genetics, gene therapy), it also introduces new risks (radiation hazards, sedentary lifestyle due to automation).
*   **Information and Communication:** Awareness regarding health rights and hygiene.
*   **Equity and Social Justice:** Ensuring the "Have-nots" get equal access to care as the "Haves."

| Category | Key Factors | Examples of Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Biological** | Genes, Chromosomes | Down's syndrome, Hemophilia |
| **Behavioral** | Smoking, Diet, Exercise | Lung Cancer, CHD, Obesity |
| **Environmental** | Air, Water, Vectors, Stress | Cholera, Malaria, Mental illness |
| **Socio-economic** | Income, Education, Job | Malnutrition, High IMR, Hygiene |
| **Health Services** | Vaccination, Antenatal Care | Polio eradication, Safe delivery |

**Clinical Relevance:**
When treating a patient, a doctor must look beyond the "Germ Theory." For example, treating a patient for [[Tuberculosis]] requires not just Anti-Tubercular Drugs (Health Service), but also addressing overcrowding (Environment), malnutrition (Socio-economic), and ensuring compliance (Behavioral).
