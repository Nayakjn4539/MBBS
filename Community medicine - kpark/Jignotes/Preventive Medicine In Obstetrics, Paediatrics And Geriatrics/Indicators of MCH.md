# [[Preventive Medicine In Obstetrics, Paediatrics And Geriatrics]] > Indicators of MCH

### **Indicators of Maternal and Child Health (MCH)**

Maternal and Child Health (MCH) status is assessed through measurements of mortality, morbidity, growth, and development. Mortality indicators are the most widely used because death is a definitive event and registration systems are generally better established than morbidity reporting.

### **1. Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)**

[[Infant Mortality Rate]] is universally regarded as the most sensitive indicator of the health status of a community, the level of living of people, and the effectiveness of MCH services.

*   **Definition:** The ratio of infant deaths (deaths under 1 year of age) registered in a given year to the total number of live births registered in the same year.
*   **Formula:**
    $$IMR = \frac{\text{Number of deaths of children < 1 year of age in a year}}{\text{Number of live births in the same year}} \times 1000$$
*   **Significance:**
    *   It is the **second best indicator** of socioeconomic development (after U5MR).
    *   It measures the risk of dying during the first year of life.
    *   A high IMR suggests poor environmental sanitation, poor nutrition, and inadequate health services.
*   **Principal Causes (India):**
    *   [[Low Birth Weight]] (LBW) and Prematurity (Major contributor).
    *   Respiratory infections.
    *   Diarrheal diseases.
    *   Congenital Malformations.
    *   Neonatal Tetanus (in unvaccinated populations).
*   **Factors Affecting IMR:**
    *   **Biological:** Birth weight, age of mother (<19 or >30 years), birth order (highest for 1st, lowest for 2nd), birth spacing.
    *   **Social:** Female literacy (inverse relationship), breast-feeding practices, early marriage.

> **Mnemonic for Causes of IMR: "LIPS"**
> *   **L** - Low Birth Weight / Lack of Hygiene
> *   **I** - Infections (Respiratory, Diarrhea)
> *   **P** - Prematurity / Perinatal conditions
> *   **S** - Sepsis / Social factors (Poverty)

### **2. Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)**

[[Maternal Mortality Ratio]] measures the risk of women dying from "puerperal causes". It reflects the quality of maternity services and obstetric care.

*   **Definition:** The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but **not** from accidental or incidental causes.
*   **Formula:**
    $$MMR = \frac{\text{Total maternal deaths in a given year}}{\text{Total live births in the same year}} \times 100,000$$
*   **Important Distinction:**
    *   **MMR (Ratio):** Denominator is **Live Births**. Multiplier is **100,000**. This is the standard measure used for global goals.
    *   **Maternal Mortality Rate:** Denominator is **Women of Reproductive Age (15-49)**. Multiplier is usually 1000 or 100,000. It captures both the risk of death per pregnancy and the fertility level.
*   **Major Causes (The "Big 5"):**
    1.  **Hemorrhage** (Postpartum Hemorrhage is the leading cause in India).
    2.  **Sepsis** (Puerperal infection).
    3.  **Hypertensive Disorders** (Eclampsia).
    4.  **Obstructed Labor**.
    5.  **Unsafe Abortion**.
*   **Clinical Relevance:** [[Anemia]] is a major indirect cause contributing to maternal death, often aggravating hemorrhage and sepsis.

> **Mnemonic for Causes of Maternal Mortality: "H-E-L-L-P"**
> *   **H** - Hemorrhage (Most Common)
> *   **E** - Embolism / Eclampsia
> *   **L** - Labor (Obstructed)
> *   **L** - Lack of Iron (Anemia - Indirect cause)
> *   **P** - Puerperal Sepsis / Pregnancy termination (Unsafe abortion)

### **3. Under-5 Mortality Rate (U5MR)**

Also known as **Child Mortality Rate**, this is increasingly viewed as the most robust indicator of child health and overall development.

*   **Definition:** The probability of a child born in a specific year or period dying before reaching the age of **5 years**.
*   **Formula:**
    $$U5MR = \frac{\text{Number of deaths of children < 5 years in a year}}{\text{Number of live births in the same year}} \times 1000$$
*   **Significance:**
    *   **UNICEF** considers U5MR the **single best indicator** of social development and well-being, even better than GNP per capita.
    *   It reflects income, nutrition, health care, and basic education.
    *   About 47% of under-5 deaths occur in the [[Neonatal period]] (first 28 days).
*   **Leading Causes:**
    *   [[Pneumonia]] (Single largest killer).
    *   Preterm birth complications.
    *   Diarrhea.
    *   Malaria.
    *   Malnutrition (Underlying cause in ~50% of deaths).

### **Comparison of Indicators**

| Indicator | Numerator | Denominator | Multiplier | Focus Area |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IMR** | Deaths < 1 year | Live Births | 1,000 | Overall Health Status |
| **MMR (Ratio)** | Maternal Deaths | Live Births | 100,000 | Obstetric Care Quality |
| **U5MR** | Deaths < 5 years | Live Births | 1,000 | Social Development |

### **Child Survival Index**
This is a derivative of the U5MR used to calculate the percentage of children who survive to age 5.
$$Child Survival Rate = \frac{1000 - U5MR}{10}$$
