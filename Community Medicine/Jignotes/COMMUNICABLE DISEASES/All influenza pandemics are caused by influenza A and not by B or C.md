# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > All influenza pandemics are caused by influenza A and not by B or C

### **Why Influenza A Causes Pandemics (and not B or C)**

To understand why [[Influenza A]] is the sole cause of pandemics while Influenza B and C are not, we must look at the unique biological and epidemiological characteristics of the virus, specifically its ability to undergo radical genetic changes and its wide host range.

### 1. Antigenic Variation: Shift vs. Drift
The primary reason lies in the mechanism of antigenic variation. The surface antigens **Haemagglutinin (H)** and **Neuraminidase (N)** determine the identity of the virus.

*   **Antigenic Shift (The Pandemic Maker):**
    *   This is a **sudden, major change** in the antigenic structure.
    *   It occurs *only* in **Influenza A**.
    *   **Mechanism:** It results from **genetic reassortment** (recombination) when a human flu virus and an animal (avian/swine) flu virus coinfect a single host (often a pig).
    *   **Result:** A completely new subtype emerges (e.g., H1N1 shifting to H2N2). Since the human population has **no pre-existing immunity** to this novel virus, it spreads explosively, causing a [[Pandemic]].

*   **Antigenic Drift (The Epidemic Maker):**
    *   This is a **gradual, minor change** due to **point mutations** in the gene.
    *   It occurs in **Influenza A and B**.
    *   **Result:** The virus changes slightly, allowing it to evade immune memory. This causes seasonal [[Epidemics]] and necessitates annual updates to the flu vaccine, but does not cause pandemics.

### 2. Animal Reservoirs
*   **Influenza A:** Has a **vast animal reservoir**. It infects birds (wild and domestic), pigs, horses, and sea mammals.
    *   Wild birds act as the primary natural reservoir.
    *   Pigs act as **"Mixing Vessels"** where human and avian viruses can swap genetic material, creating a novel pandemic strain.
*   **Influenza B and C:** These are primarily **human pathogens**. They have no significant animal reservoir to facilitate genetic reassortment. Therefore, they cannot undergo the radical changes needed to cause a pandemic.

### 3. Subtypes and Severity
*   **Influenza A:** Divided into multiple subtypes based on H (18 types) and N (11 types) antigens (e.g., H1N1, H5N1). This diversity allows for severe disease and high mutability.
*   **Influenza B:** No subtypes (only lineages like Yamagata and Victoria). It generally causes milder disease than A, though it can still cause severe epidemics.
*   **Influenza C:** Antigenically stable. It causes only mild, sporadic upper respiratory infections (like a common cold) and is not a public health threat.

### **Comparison of Influenza Viruses**

| Feature | [[Influenza A]] | [[Influenza B]] | [[Influenza C]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Reservoir** | Humans, **Animals** (Birds, Pigs, Horses) | Humans only | Humans only |
| **Antigenic Changes** | **Shift** and Drift | Drift only | Stable |
| **Subtypes** | Many (e.g., H1N1, H3N2) | None | None |
| **Pandemic Potential** | **Yes** (e.g., 1918, 2009) | No | No |
| **Epidemic Potential** | Widespread regional/global epidemics | Regional epidemics | Sporadic cases |
| **Severity** | Severe | Moderate | Mild |

> **Clinical Relevance:**
> The [[Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) 2009]] (Swine Flu) was a classic example of **Antigenic Shift**. It was a novel virus of swine origin to which the majority of the human population had little or no immunity. It spread rapidly across the globe, unlike seasonal flu which spreads slower due to some herd immunity.

### **Mnemonics**

*   **For Severity and Pandemics:**
    *   **A** = **A**wful, **A**nimal reservoir, **A**ntigenic Shift (**A**lone causes Pandemics).
    *   **B** = **B**ad (Epidemics), but **B**arely shifts (Drift only).
    *   **C** = **C**old-like (Mild), **C**hild's play.

*   **For Shift vs Drift:**
    *   **Shift** = **S**udden, **S**evere, **S**pecies mixing (Pandemic).
    *   **Drift** = **D**ecreased immunity, **G**radual change (Epidemic).
