# [[Irritant Poisons (Metallic)]] > Lead

**Lead** (Pb) is a heavy, soft, greyish metal. It is a typical [[cumulative poison]]. It has no known physiological role in the human body.

### Synonyms
*   [[Plumbism]]
*   Saturnism
*   Painter's Colic
*   Colica Pictonum

### Sources of Exposure
Lead is ubiquitous in the environment.
1.  **Occupational:** Battery manufacturing, painting (lead paints), glass blowing, pottery/ceramics glazing, printing (type-setting), smelting, plumbing, soldering.
2.  **Domestic/Environmental:** Lead water pipes, exhaust fumes from leaded petrol (historical), cosmetics/vermilion ([[Sindoor]]).
3.  **Accidental:** 
    *   Children eating peeling paint or toys (Pica).
    *   Contaminated food (adulteration of turmeric).
    *   Traditional medicines (Ayurvedic/Herbal preparations).
    *   Retained bullets in the body.

### Absorption, Metabolism, and Excretion
*   **Absorption:** Mainly through inhalation (fumes/dust) and ingestion. Organic lead (Tetraethyl lead) can be absorbed through intact skin.
*   **Distribution:** 
    *   95% binds to erythrocytes.
    *   **Cumulative:** Stored in the skeleton (bones), hair, and nails. Lead competes with calcium and is deposited in the bone lattice (specifically cancellous bone).
*   **Excretion:** Primarily via urine and feces; small amounts in milk, sweat, and saliva. It crosses the placental barrier.

### Acute Lead Poisoning
This is relatively rare and usually occurs due to accidental ingestion of large quantities of soluble lead salts (e.g., Lead acetate - "Sugar of Lead").

**Clinical Features:**
1.  **Gastrointestinal:**
    *   Metallic, astringent taste in mouth.
    *   Dry throat and intense thirst.
    *   **Vomiting:** Vomitus is white (lead chloride) initially, turning black later.
    *   **Pain:** Severe colicky abdominal pain.
    *   **Stool:** Constipation or diarrhea with **black stools** (due to formation of lead sulfide).
2.  **Systemic:**
    *   Muscle cramps, leg cramps.
    *   Insomnia, headache, giddiness.
    *   Convulsions, numbness, paralysis of limbs.
    *   Collapse, shock, and death (rarely in 2-3 days).

### Chronic Lead Poisoning (Plumbism)
This is the most common form of lead toxicity, usually occupational or environmental.

**Clinical Features (Mnemonic: ABCDEFGHI):**

1.  **[[Anemia]]**:
    *   Facial pallor (Circumoral pallor) is the earliest and most consistent sign.
    *   Type: Microcytic hypochromic anemia (can be hemolytic).
    *   **Mechanism:** Lead inhibits enzymes in heme synthesis:
        *   Delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase ([[ALA dehydratase]]).
        *   [[Ferrochelatase]].
2.  **[[Basophilic Stippling]]**:
    *   Presence of "Punctate Basophilia" in RBCs.
    *   Due to inhibition of the enzyme **5-pyrimidine nucleotidase**, leading to aggregation of ribosomal RNA.
3.  **Colic (Painter's Colic/Lead Colic)**:
    *   Severe, spasmodic abdominal pain (intestinal cramps).
    *   Relieved by pressure.
    *   Associated with obstinate **Constipation**.
4.  **Drop ([[Lead Palsy]])**:
    *   **Wrist Drop:** Paralysis of extensor muscles of the wrist (Radial nerve involvement).
    *   **Foot Drop:** Paralysis of peroneal muscles (Lateral popliteal nerve).
    *   *Characteristic:* Sensory changes are usually absent; muscle groups most prone to fatigue are affected first.
5.  **[[Encephalopathy]] (Lead Encephalopathy)**:
    *   More common in children.
    *   Features: Vomiting, headache, insomnia, visual disturbances, irritability, delirium, convulsions, and coma.
    *   Permanent mental retardation can occur in survivors.
6.  **Facial Pallor**: Due to vasospasm and anemia.
7.  **Gums ([[Burtonian Line]])**:
    *   A stippled **blue line** on the gums at the junction with teeth.
    *   **Mechanism:** Formation of **Lead Sulfide** (Lead circulates in blood + H₂S formed by food decomposition/bacteria in mouth).
    *   *Note:* Seen only in patients with poor oral hygiene/carious teeth; absent in edentulous persons.
8.  **Hypertension**: Due to vascular constriction and nephrosclerosis.
9.  **Infertility/Impotence**:
    *   Menstrual derangements (amenorrhea, menorrhagia).
    *   Spontaneous abortion (ecbolic action).
    *   Sterility in males (gametotoxic) and females.

**Other Features:**
*   **Renal:** Chronic interstitial nephritis, [[Fanconi syndrome]] (aminoaciduria, glycosuria, phosphaturia).
*   **Saturnine Gout:** Accumulation of uric acid due to renal impairment.

### Organic Lead Poisoning
*   Caused by **Tetraethyl lead** (anti-knock agent in petrol).
*   Absorbed through **intact skin** and lungs.
*   **Clinical Picture:** Predominantly **CNS symptoms** (insomnia, nightmare, headache, delirium, mania).
*   *Note:* Burtonian line, colic, and stippling are usually **absent**.

### Diagnosis and Investigations

| Investigation | Findings |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Blood Lead Level (BLL)** | Gold standard. <10 µg/dL is acceptable. >70 µg/dL is a medical emergency. |
| **Urine Analysis** | Increased **Coproporphyrin III** (Screening test). Increased **ALA** (Delta-aminolevulinic acid). |
| **Peripheral Smear** | [[Basophilic stippling]] of RBCs. |
| **X-Ray (Long bones)** | **[[Lead lines]]**: Transverse radio-opaque bands at the metaphysis of growing long bones (due to increased calcium deposition, not lead itself). |
| **X-Ray (Abdomen)** | May show radio-opaque material if paint chips/batteries were ingested. |

### Treatment

**1. Decontamination (Acute):**
*   **Gastric Lavage:** With 1% Sodium or Magnesium Sulfate (precipitates lead as insoluble lead sulfate).
*   **Demulcents:** Egg white, milk.
*   **Whole Bowel Irrigation:** If radio-opaque chips are seen on X-ray.

**2. Chelation Therapy (Specific Antidotes):**
The primary goal is to form a stable complex with lead for excretion.

*   **[[CaNa2EDTA]] (Calcium Disodium Versenate):**
    *   Dose: 25–35 mg/kg IV or IM.
    *   *Caution:* Can act as a nephrotoxin; ensure good hydration.
*   **[[BAL]] (British Anti-Lewisite / Dimercaprol):**
    *   Drug of choice in **Lead Encephalopathy** or renal failure.
    *   *Protocol:* BAL is given **4 hours before** EDTA (to prevent EDTA from mobilizing lead from bones into the brain, which would worsen encephalopathy).
*   **[[D-Penicillamine]]:** Oral chelating agent (used for follow-up).
*   **[[Succimer]] (DMSA):** Oral agent; water-soluble analogue of BAL. Effective and less toxic; preferred in children with BLL > 45 µg/dL.

**3. Symptomatic:**
*   **Lead Colic:** IV Calcium Gluconate (10 ml of 10%) relieves pain (spasmolytic).
*   **Cerebral Edema:** Mannitol, corticosteroids (dexamethasone).
*   **Seizures:** Diazepam.

### Autopsy Findings

*   **External:**
    *   Emaciation.
    *   Pale skin (anemia).
    *   [[Burtonian line]] on gums (bluish-black stippled line).
*   **Internal:**
    *   **Stomach:** Mucosa may be greyish or black (acute cases).
    *   **Intestines:** Contracted and thickened (chronic).
    *   **Liver/Kidneys:** Fatty degeneration. Kidneys may show contracted granular cortex (chronic nephritis).
    *   **Brain:** Edema, flattening of gyri (encephalopathy).
    *   **Bone Marrow:** Hyperplasia.

### Medicolegal Aspects

1.  **Accidental:** Most common.
    *   **Children:** Pica (eating paint chips, plaster, toys containing lead).
    *   **Occupational:** Industrial exposure.
    *   **Water:** Lead pipes (plumbo-solvency).
2.  **Abortifacient:** Lead oleate/diachylon plaster was historically used to induce abortion (stick was inserted into the os).
3.  **Adulteration:** Foodstuffs (e.g., turmeric adulterated with lead chromate).
4.  **Homicidal:** Rare due to bad taste and color.
5.  **Bullet Embolism:** Retained bullets in synovial joints or bone marrow can leach lead over years causing delayed plumbism.
