# [[MEDICINE & SOCIAL SCIENCE]] > Social mobilisation

### **Social Mobilisation**

**Social Mobilisation** is a broad-scale health communication strategy that goes beyond simple health education. It is the process of bringing together all feasible and practical inter-sectoral allies to raise awareness of and demand for a particular health program, to assist in the delivery of resources, and to strengthen **[[Community Participation]]** for sustainability.

It transforms "felt needs" into "demands" and eventually into satisfied health needs.

### **1. Core Concept and Definition**
*   It is the **planned process** of enlisting the support of all key players in society to achieve a health goal.
*   **Aim:** To create a supportive environment for the health program and ensure high coverage and utilization of services.
*   **Key Philosophy:** "Health cannot be attained by the health sector alone." It requires **[[Intersectoral Coordination]]**.

### **2. Levels of Social Mobilisation**
Social mobilisation operates at three distinct levels to ensure the message permeates all layers of society:

1.  **Individual/Household Level:**
    *   Informing and motivating individuals (e.g., parents, patients) through **[[Interpersonal Communication (IPC)]]**.
    *   *Example:* **[[ASHA]]** or Anganwadi worker visiting a home to persuade parents for vaccination.

2.  **Community Level:**
    *   Involving local leaders, religious heads, teachers, and self-help groups (**[[Mahila Arogya Samiti]]**).
    *   *Example:* Village Health and Nutrition Days (VHND).

3.  **Policy/National Level:**
    *   Advocacy with policy-makers, bureaucrats, and media to create political will and allocate resources.

### **3. Key Partners in Social Mobilisation**
To be successful, the process must involve specific "allies":
*   **Decision Makers:** Politicians, Bureaucrats (for funding and policy).
*   **Opinion Leaders:** Religious leaders, School teachers, Village headmen (Sarpanch).
*   **Professional Groups:** Doctors (IMA), Lawyers, Artists.
*   **Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs):** Rotary, Lions Club, Red Cross.
*   **Media:** TV, Radio, Print, Social Media.

---

### **4. Strategies and Activities**
*   **Advocacy:** Convincing leaders to support the cause.
*   **Information, Education, and Communication (IEC):** Creating awareness through mass media and folk media.
*   **Community Empowerment:** Training local volunteers to take ownership.
*   **Demand Generation:** Making the community ask for services (e.g., demanding **[[ORS]]** packets or contraceptives).

### **5. Clinical and Programmatic Relevance (Examples)**

*   **[[Pulse Polio Immunization]] (The Classic Example):**
    *   *Action:* Involvement of religious leaders (Imams/Priests) to counter resistance and rumors against the vaccine in minority communities.
    *   *Outcome:* Massive turnout at booths and acceptance of house-to-house drops.
    *   *Network:* The **Social Mobilization Network (SMNet)** was specifically created for polio eradication in high-risk states (UP, Bihar).

*   **[[Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP)]] / NTEP:**
    *   *Action:* Using "Cured Patients" as motivators to encourage adherence to **[[DOTS]]**.
    *   *Strategy:* Context-specific advocacy, communication, and social mobilization (ACSM) is a key component of the National Strategic Plan,.

*   **[[National AIDS Control Programme (NACP)]]:**
    *   *Action:* Using peer educators among high-risk groups (Sex workers, IDUs) to promote condom use and reduce stigma.
    *   *Goal:* To create an enabling environment.
