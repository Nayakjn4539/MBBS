# Amoebiasis

Amoebiasis is an infection of the human gastrointestinal tract caused by the protozoan parasite [[Entamoeba histolytica]]. It is a major public health problem, particularly in developing countries with poor sanitation. It affects approximately 15% of the Indian population.

### Epidemiological Determinants

**1. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** [[Entamoeba histolytica]].
    *   Exists in two forms: **Trophozoite** (Vegetative/Invasive form) and **Cyst** (Infective/Resistant form).
    *   Identification of potentially pathogenic strains is done by *zymodeme analysis*.
*   **Resistance:** Cysts are very hardy. They can survive for weeks in water.
    *   **Crucial Point:** Cysts are **NOT killed** by standard chlorination of water. They are killed by boiling, drying, or sand filtration.
*   **Infectivity:** The cyst is the infective form. Trophozoites are fragile and destroyed by gastric acid.

**2. Host Factors**
*   **Natural Host/Reservoir:** [[Man]] is the only known reservoir.
*   **Source of Infection:** Feces containing cysts.
    *   **Asymptomatic Cyst Passers:** These healthy carriers are the most dangerous source of infection in the community as they shed millions of cysts daily without symptoms.
*   **Susceptibility:** Universal susceptibility. No significant age or sex difference in infection rates, though invasive amoebiasis (like liver abscess) is more common in adult males.

### Mode of Transmission
Transmission is primarily **Fecal-Oral**.
1.  **Contaminated Water/Food:** Ingestion of mature cysts via water or raw vegetables (fertilized with night soil).
2.  **Direct Contact:** Fecal contamination of fingers (poor personal hygiene).
3.  **Vectors:** Flies, cockroaches, and rodents acting as mechanical carriers.
4.  **Sexual Transmission:** Oral-anal contact (rare, seen in specific high-risk groups).

> *   **F**ood
> *   **F**luids

### Incubation Period
*   Variable: Commonly **2 to 4 weeks**.
*   Can range from a few days to months or even years.

### Clinical Picture
The clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic carrier state (most common) to severe invasive disease.

**1. Intestinal Amoebiasis**
*   **Amoebic Dysentery:** Gradual onset, abdominal pain, tenesmus, and passage of loose stools containing **blood and mucus**.
*   **Ulcers:** Produces characteristic **[[Flask-shaped ulcers]]** in the colon (narrow neck, broad base).
*   **Amoeboma:** A granulomatous mass mimicking carcinoma.

**2. Extra-Intestinal Amoebiasis**
*   **Amoebic Liver Abscess (ALA):** The most common extra-intestinal manifestation.
    *   Features: Fever, right upper quadrant pain, tender hepatomegaly.
    *   Aspiration reveals **"Anchovy Sauce"** pus (chocolate-colored).
*   Other sites: Lung (pulmonary amoebiasis), Brain (cerebral amoebiasis), Skin (cutaneous amoebiasis).

### Diagnosis
1.  **Stool Microscopy:**
    *   **Definitive Diagnosis:** Presence of **[[Erythrophagocytic Trophozoites]]** (Trophozoites containing ingested Red Blood Cells) in fresh warm stool or mucus.
    *   Presence of cysts (spherical, 1-4 nuclei, chromatoid bodies).
2.  **Serology:**
    *   IHA (Indirect Hemagglutination) and ELISA are useful for *invasive* and *extra-intestinal* amoebiasis (like liver abscess) where stool may be negative.
3.  **Imaging:** USG/CT scan for Liver Abscess.

### Differential Diagnosis: Bacillary vs Amoebic Dysentery

| Feature | Amoebic Dysentery | Bacillary Dysentery (Shigellosis) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Onset** | Gradual | Acute |
| **General Condition** | Walk-about patient (Alert) | Prostrated/Toxic |
| **Fever** | Mild/Absent | High Grade |
| **Stool** | Bulky, offensive, mixed with blood | Scanty, odorless, mostly blood/pus |
| **Microscopy** | RBCs clumped, E. histolytica present | RBCs discrete, Macrophages present |

### Treatment
Treatment strategy depends on the clinical status:

1.  **Invasive/Symptomatic Disease (Dysentery/Liver Abscess):**
    *   **Drug of Choice:** [[Metronidazole]] (Tissue amoebicide).
    *   Dose: 30 mg/kg/day or approx 400-800 mg TDS for 5-10 days.
    *   Alternative: Tinidazole.
2.  **Asymptomatic Cyst Passers:**
    *   Must be treated to prevent spread.
    *   **Drug of Choice:** [[Diloxanide Furoate]] or Iodoquinol (Luminal amoebicides).
    *   *Note:* In endemic areas, treating all asymptomatic carriers is often not feasible due to high reinfection rates.

> **Clinical Relevance:** Metronidazole kills the invasive trophozoites but is poorly effective against cysts in the lumen. Therefore, after treating invasive disease with Metronidazole, always follow up with a luminal agent (Diloxanide Furoate) to eradicate the carrier state.

### Prevention and Control

**1. Sanitation (Primary Prevention):**
*   Safe disposal of human excreta (Sanitary latrines).
*   Breaking the transmission cycle is the most effective measure.

**2. Water Safety:**
*   **Filtration:** Sand filters effectively remove cysts.
*   **Boiling:** Kills cysts instantly.
*   *Note:* Regular chlorination is **ineffective**. For emergency disinfection, super-chlorination or iodine is required.

**3. Food Hygiene:**
*   Proper washing of raw vegetables and fruits (cysts can survive in soil/fertilizer).
*   Health education for food handlers (hand washing).
*   Protection of food from flies and cockroaches.

**4. Chemoprophylaxis:**
*   Generally **not recommended** for mass use.
