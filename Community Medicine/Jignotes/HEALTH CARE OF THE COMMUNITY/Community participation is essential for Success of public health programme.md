# [[HEALTH CARE OF THE COMMUNITY]] > Community participation is essential for Success of public health programme

### Community Participation in Health Care

**Community participation** is the process by which individuals and families assume responsibility for their own health and welfare and for those of the community, and develop the capacity to contribute to their own and the community’s development.

It is one of the four fundamental **principles/pillars** of [[Primary Health Care]] (along with Equitable Distribution, Intersectoral Coordination, and Appropriate Technology).

### Why is Community Participation Essential?

Community participation is often considered the "heart" of successful public health programmes. Without it, health services are often viewed merely as government-imposed schemes rather than people's own programs.

1.  **Sustainability:** Programs are more likely to last when the community takes ownership ("Health by the People").
2.  **Self-Reliance:** It reduces dependence on the government for every minor health need and promotes self-care.
3.  **Resource Mobilization:** The community can contribute land, labor, funds, or materials for health centers, reducing the burden on the state.
4.  **Cultural Acceptance:** Local involvement helps bridge the gap between traditional beliefs and modern medicine.
5.  **Better Utilization:** When people are involved in planning, they are more likely to utilize the health services provided.

### Ways of Participation

According to WHO/UNICEF, a community can participate in the following three ways:

1.  **Utilization of Services:** The community actively uses the provided services (e.g., immunization, antenatal care).
2.  **Contribution of Resources:** Providing manpower, money, or materials (e.g., donating land for a [[Sub-centre]] or [[Primary Health Centre]]).
3.  **Active Involvement:** Participation in planning, implementation, management, and evaluation of health services.

### Types of Community Participation

| Type | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Marginal** | Participation is limited and transitory. | Participation in a one-time eye camp or blood donation drive. |
| **Substantial** | Community plays an active role in determining priorities. | Activities of [[Panchayati Raj Institutions]] (PRIs) in sanitation or water supply. |
| **Structural** | Community becomes an integral part of the program. | [[ASHA]] working within the village; [[Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committee]] (VHSNC). |

### Implementation in India: The "Health Team" Approach

In India, community participation is institutionalized through various grassroots level workers and committees:

*   **[[Accredited Social Health Activist]] (ASHA):** The key link worker selected *by* the community (Gram Panchayat) and accountable *to* the community. She mobilizes people for immunization, institutional delivery, and sanitation.
*   **[[Anganwadi Worker]] (AWW):** Under the [[Integrated Child Development Services]] (ICDS), she is a local woman providing nutrition and health education.
*   **[[Village Health Guides]] (VHG):** A scheme launched in 1977 where a person from the village provides basic primary care.
*   **[[Trained Dais]] (Traditional Birth Attendants):** Involving local birth attendants to ensure safe delivery practices.
*   **[[Rogi Kalyan Samiti]] (Patient Welfare Committee):** Community members and local leaders manage the affairs of hospitals (PHC/CHC/District Hospital) to improve patient facilities.
*   **[[Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committee]] (VHSNC):** A committee at the village level that plans local health actions.
*   **[[Mahila Arogya Samiti]] (MAS):** Community based groups in urban slums under the [[National Urban Health Mission]].

### Barriers to Community Participation

Despite its importance, achieving true participation is difficult due to:
1.  **Social Stratification:** Caste, religion, and class divisions in Indian villages make it hard to get a unified "community" voice.
2.  **Medical Resistance:** Professional health workers often underestimate the community's intelligence or potential contribution.
3.  **Bureaucracy:** Rigid administrative structures often use a "top-down" approach rather than a "bottom-up" approach.
4.  **Lack of Education:** High illiteracy rates can hinder effective decision-making.

### Clinical & Public Health Relevance

*   **Failure of Malaria Eradication:** The National Malaria Eradication Program (NMEP) initially failed because it was a vertical program with little community involvement. People refused DDT spraying because they didn't understand its purpose after the collateral benefit of killing bed bugs wore off.
*   **Success of Pulse Polio:** The eradication of Polio in India was largely due to massive **social mobilization** and community participation, involving religious leaders and local volunteers to overcome vaccine hesitancy.
