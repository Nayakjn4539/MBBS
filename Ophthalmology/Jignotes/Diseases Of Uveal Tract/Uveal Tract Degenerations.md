# Degenerations of the Uveal Tract

The uveal tract (iris, ciliary body, and choroid) is subject to various degenerative and dystrophic changes. These can be broadly classified based on the anatomical structure involved: the **Iris** or the **Choroid**.

---

## I. Degenerations of the Iris

Degenerative changes in the iris can vary from simple age-related atrophy to progressive pathological conditions.

### 1. Simple Iris Atrophy
This condition is characterized by depigmentation and thinning of the iris stroma.
*   **Appearance:** Small patches of depigmentation are usually seen near the pupillary margin.
*   **Etiology:**
    *   **Senile atrophy:** Age-related changes.
    *   **Post-inflammatory:** Sequelae of iridocyclitis.
    *   **Glaucomatous:** Due to high intraocular pressure (IOP).
    *   **Neurogenic:** Due to lesions of the [[ciliary ganglion]].

### 2. Essential Iris Atrophy (Progressive Iris Atrophy)
A rare, idiopathic, progressive condition that is typically unilateral. It is considered part of the **Iridocorneal Endothelial (ICE) Syndromes**,.
*   **Demographics:** Typically affects young females.
*   **Pathogenesis:** Proliferation of abnormal corneal endothelial cells forming a membrane over the angle and iris.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Corectopia:** Displacement of the pupil away from the atrophic zone.
    *   **Pseudopolycoria:** Formation of holes in the iris (supernumerary false pupils) due to melting away of iris tissue,.
    *   **Ectropion Uveae:** Outward turning of the pigmented iris epithelium.
    *   **Secondary Glaucoma:** Intractable glaucoma develops due to the formation of peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS).
*   **Associated Variants (ICE Syndromes):**
    *   **Chandler’s Syndrome:** Characterized by severe [[corneal edema]] and blurred vision; iris changes are mild.
    *   **Cogan-Reese Syndrome:** Characterized by diffuse nevi or pedunculated [[iris nodules]].

### 3. Iridoschisis
A rare, bilateral senile degeneration, usually seen in patients over 65 years of age.
*   **Mechanism:** Separation (cleavage) occurs between the anterior and posterior stroma of the [[iris]].
*   **Signs:** Strands of anterior stroma float into the [[anterior chamber]] looking like teased-out wool,.
*   **Clinical Implication:** High incidence (50%) of [[angle-closure glaucoma]].

### 4. Heterochromia Iridis
Differences in iris color can be congenital or acquired due to degenerative/inflammatory processes.
*   **Fuchs’ Heterochromic Iridocyclitis:** A chronic, non-granulomatous [[anterior uveitis]] characterized by iris stromal atrophy leading to a lighter colored iris (hypochromia) in the affected eye,.
    *   **Triad:** Heterochromia + Cataract + Glaucoma.

## II. Degenerations and Dystrophies of the Choroid

Choroidal degenerations are more frequent and clinically significant than those of the anterior uvea. They are classified into primary and secondary forms.

### A. Primary Choroidal Degenerations

#### 1. Senile Central Choroidal Atrophy (Tay’s Choroiditis)
*   **Pathology:** Characterized by the formation of multiple [[drusen]] (colloid bodies) on **Bruch’s membrane**,.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Numerous minute yellowish-white spots in the macular region.
    *   May be a precursor to **disciform macular degeneration**.
    *   Usually bilateral; visual impairment occurs only in advanced stages.

#### 2. Central Areolar Choroidal Atrophy (Sclerosis)
*   **Genetics:** Autosomal dominant,.
*   **Pathology:** Atrophy of the **choriocapillaris** and **retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)** at the macula.
*   **Clinical Appearance:**
    *   Bilateral, punched-out, circular or oval patch of degeneration at the macula.
    *   **Diagnostic Sign:** Large, ribbon-shaped choroidal vessels are visible traversing the white scleral background (due to atrophy of overlying tissues),.
*   **Symptom:** Absolute [[central scotoma]].

#### 3. Essential Gyrate Atrophy
A rare, progressive dystrophy involving the choroid and retina.
*   **Genetics:** Autosomal Recessive,.
*   **Etiology:** Inborn error of metabolism due to deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme **Ornithine Aminotransferase (OAT)**,.
*   **Biochemistry:** Increased levels of **ornithine** in plasma, urine, CSF, and aqueous humor.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Night Blindness:** usually the first symptom.
    *   **Fundus:** Scalloped, circular patches of chorioretinal atrophy starting in the periphery and fusing to involve the posterior pole,.
    *   **Macular Sparing:** The macula is spared until late stages.
    *   Associated with high **axial myopia** and posterior [[cataract]].
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6)** supplementation,.
    *   Diet low in **Arginine** (precursor of ornithine),.

#### 4. Choroideremia
A hereditary choroidal dystrophy.
*   **Genetics:** X-linked recessive (Affects males; females are carriers),,.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Onsets in the first decade with **night blindness**.
    *   Progressive atrophy of the **choroid** and **RPE**.
    *   **Fundus:** In advanced stages (by age 40), the fundus appears white (sclera visible) with retinal blood vessels remaining normal in appearance (unlike [[retinitis pigmentosa]] where vessels attenuate),.
    *   **ERG:** Non-recordable (scotopic).

#### 5. Myopic Chorioretinal Degeneration (Pathological Myopia)
Degenerative changes associated with high/pathological myopia (> -6D), primarily affecting the posterior pole.
*   **Etiology:** Not inflammatory; involves stretching and atrophy of choroidal and scleral tissues.
*   **Fundus Changes:**
    *   **Temporal Myopic Crescent:** Choroidal/retinal atrophy at the temporal edge of the disc,.
    *   **Posterior Staphyloma:** Ectasia of the sclera at the posterior pole; vessels appear to bend backward over the margin,.
    *   **Lacquer Cracks:** Linear breaks in **Bruch’s membrane**; predispose to choroidal neovascularization (CNV),.
    *   **Foster-Fuchs’ Spot:** A dark red/pigmented circular spot at the macula due to sub-retinal neovascularization and hemorrhage,.
    *   **Tessellated/Tigroid Fundus:** Choroidal vessels become visible due to thinning of RPE.
*   **Complications:** [[Retinal detachment]] (due to lattice degeneration), Complicated cataract, Vitreous hemorrhage,.

#### 6. Age-Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD)
A non-hereditary degeneration affecting the choriocapillaris, Bruch’s membrane, and RPE in elderly individuals (>50 years),.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Dry (Non-exudative):** 90% of cases. Characterized by **Drusen** (colloid bodies on Bruch's membrane) and **Geographic Atrophy** of RPE,.
    *   **Wet (Exudative):** 10% of cases but causes severe vision loss. Characterized by **Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV)**, RPE detachment, and disciform scarring,.
*   **Treatment:** Anti-VEGF agents (e.g., [[Bevacizumab]], [[Ranibizumab]]) for wet ARMD; Antioxidants (AREDS formula) for dry ARMD,.

### B. Secondary Choroidal Degenerations

These occur following inflammatory lesions (post-inflammatory atrophy).
*   **Appearance:** Scattered areas of chorioretinal atrophy with pigment clumping.
*   **Pseudoretinitis Pigmentosa:** The fundus picture may resemble [[retinitis pigmentosa]] (bone spicules) due to pigment migration, often seen in syphilis or toxicity,.

---

### C. Angioid Streaks
Degenerative breaks in the collagenous and elastic portions of **Bruch’s membrane**.
*   **Appearance:** Irregular, dark-red or brownish streaks radiating from the optic disc, resembling blood vessels.
*   **Associations (Mnemonic: PEPSI):**
    *   **P**seudoxanthoma elasticum (most common).
    *   **E**hlers-Danlos syndrome.
    *   **P**aget’s disease of bone.
    *   **S**ickle cell disease,.
    *   **I**diopathic.
*   **Complication:** Choroidal neovascularization leading to macular hemorrhage and scarring.
