# [[Vision 2020]]: The Right to Sight

**Vision 2020** is a global initiative launched by the **World Health Organization ([[WHO]])** and a task force of international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to combat the mammoth problem of blindness.

### Overview and Launch
*   **Global Launch:** February 18, 1999, in Geneva, Switzerland.
*   **India Launch:** October 10-13, 2001, in Goa (India was the first country to launch the National Programme for Control of Blindness in 1976).
*   **Mission:** To eliminate **avoidable blindness** by the year 2020 and reduce the global burden of blindness.
*   **Global Partners:** WHO, [[IAPB]] (International Agency for Prevention of Blindness), CBM, Helen Keller International, Sight Savers International, ORBIS International.

### Objectives
1.  Eliminate avoidable blindness (Preventable + Curable).
2.  Reduce the prevalence of blindness to **0.3%**.
3.  Target the major blinding diseases through a specific disease-control strategy.

---

### Core Strategies
The initiative is built on four strategic pillars to ensure long-term sustainability:
1.  **Disease Prevention and Control:** Tackling specific blinding conditions.
2.  **Infrastructure Development:** Creating a pyramid of eye care services.
3.  **Human Resource Development:** Training ophthalmologists, optometrists, and paramedical staff.
4.  **Strengthening Advocacy:** Increasing public awareness and resource mobilization.

### Target Diseases
The program identifies specific diseases based on their contribution to the burden of blindness and the feasibility of intervention. There is a variance between the Global targets and the Indian targets.

| Global Target Diseases (5) | Indian Target Diseases (7) |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1. [[Cataract]] | 1. [[Cataract]] |
| 2. [[Childhood Blindness]] | 2. [[Childhood Blindness]] |
| 3. [[Refractive Errors]] & [[Low Vision]] | 3. [[Refractive Errors]] & [[Low Vision]] |
| 4. [[Trachoma]] | 4. [[Trachoma]] (Focal) |
| 5. [[Onchocerciasis]] (River Blindness) | 5. [[Diabetic Retinopathy]] |
| | 6. [[Glaucoma]] |
| | 7. [[Corneal Blindness]] |

*Note: [[Onchocerciasis]] is not a target disease in India.*

#### Disease-Specific Interventions
*   **Cataract:** Increase **Cataract Surgical Rate (CSR)**; shift to [[IOL]] implantation surgeries.
*   **Childhood Blindness:** Vitamin A supplementation, measles immunization, screening for [[Retinopathy of Prematurity]] (ROP).
*   **Trachoma:** Implementation of the **SAFE Strategy** (Surgery, Antibiotics, Facial hygiene, Environmental change).
*   **Refractive Errors:** School eye screening programs and providing affordable spectacles.
*   **Onchocerciasis:** Annual doses of Ivermectin (Mectizan) in endemic areas.

### Infrastructure Development (The Pyramid Model)
Vision 2020 proposes a four-tier pyramid structure to deliver eye care services efficiently.

| Level of Care | Unit Name | Target Population | Staffing/Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary** | **[[Vision Centre]]** | 1 per **50,000** | Manned by Ophthalmic Assistant/Paramedic. Refraction, primary screening, referral. |
| **Secondary** | **[[Service Centre]]** | 1 per **500,000** | Manned by Ophthalmologists. Cataract surgery, refraction, referral service. |
| **Tertiary** | **[[Training Centre]]** | 1 per **5 Million** | Medical Colleges/Regional Institutes. Corneal transplantation, glaucoma surgery, retinal surgery, training. |
| **Apex** | **[[Centre of Excellence]]** (COE) | 1 per **50 Million** | Professional leadership, CME, Research, laying standards (e.g., [[RP Centre]], AIIMS). |

**Clinical Implication:** This tiered system ensures that simple cases (refractive errors) are handled locally, preventing overcrowding at tertiary centers which focus on complex surgeries like [[Retinopathy]].

### Human Resource Development
To meet the targets, specific ratios of eye-care personnel to the population were recommended for India:
*   **Ophthalmologists:** 1 : 100,000
*   **Ophthalmic Assistants/Optometrists:** 1 : 10,000 (Ideal to have 1 per vision centre)
*   **Eye Care Managers:** To manage the administrative side of hospitals.

### School Eye Screening Programme
*   **Target:** Children aged **10–14 years** (Class 5th to 8th).
*   **Screener:** School teachers trained to measure vision.
*   **Method:** [[Vision screening cards]] and measurement tape.
*   **Criteria:** If Visual Acuity is **< 6/9** in either eye, the child is referred to a Primary Health Centre (PHC) or Vision Centre.

---

### Successor: Global Action Plan (GAP)
Following Vision 2020, the World Health Assembly adopted **"Universal Eye Health: A Global Action Plan 2014–2019"**.
*   **Goal:** Reduction in the prevalence of avoidable visual impairment by **25%** by 2019 (from the baseline of 2010).
