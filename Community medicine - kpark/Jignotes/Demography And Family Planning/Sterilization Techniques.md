# [[Demography And Family Planning]] > Sterilization Techniques

### Sterilization Techniques (Terminal Methods)

Sterilization is a permanent method of contraception for couples who have completed their family size. It is the most effective contraceptive method but involves surgical intervention. In India, female sterilization accounts for about 85% and male sterilization for 10-15% of all sterilizations, despite male sterilization being simpler and safer.

### 1. Male Sterilization: [[Vasectomy]]

It involves the cutting and blocking of the **vas deferens** to prevent spermatozoa from entering the ejaculate.

#### A. Techniques
1.  **Conventional Vasectomy:** Requires a small incision on the scrotum. Stitches are removed on the 5th day.
2.  **[[No Scalpel Vasectomy (NSV)]]:**
    *   Developed by **Dr. Li Shunqiang** in China.
    *   Also known as **"Key-hole vasectomy"**.
    *   **Procedure:** Instead of a scalpel, a **vas fixation clamp** and a **vas dissecting clamp** are used to make a tiny puncture.
    *   **Advantages:** No incision, no stitches, less pain, faster recovery, and fewer complications (hematoma/infection).

#### B. Post-Operative Advice (Crucial for Exam)
*   **Not Immediately Sterile:** The patient is **NOT** sterile immediately after the operation. Sperm are stored in the seminal vesicles.
*   **Barrier Method:** Must use another contraceptive (e.g., [[Condoms]]) until **azoospermia** is established.
    *   Rule of Thumb: **30 Ejaculations** or approximately **3 months**.
*   Avoid cycling or lifting heavy weights for **15 days**.
*   Wear a scrotal support (T-bandage) for 15 days.

#### C. Complications
*   **Operative:** Pain, scrotal hematoma, local infection (3%).
*   **[[Sperm Granules]]**: Hard, painful nodules (approx. 7mm) appearing 10-14 days post-op due to sperm leakage. Usually subside spontaneously.
*   **Spontaneous Recanalization:** Occurs in 0–6% cases, leading to failure.
*   **Autoimmune Response:** 54% of men develop **[[Antisperm antibodies]]** due to sperm reabsorption. This reduces fertility even after successful reversal surgery.

#### D. Causes of Failure
*   **Mistaken identification:** Ligation of a vessel or lymphatic duct instead of the vas deferens (Most common cause).
*   **Recanalization:** Spontaneous rejoining of cut ends.
*   **Unprotected Intercourse:** Before the seminal fluid is sperm-free.
*   **Failure Rate (Pearl Index):** 0.1 to 0.15 per 100 Women Years (HWY).

### 2. Female Sterilization: [[Tubectomy]]

It involves the occlusion of fallopian tubes to prevent the egg from meeting the sperm.

#### A. Surgical Approaches
| Feature | **[[Laparoscopy]]** | **[[Minilaparotomy]] (Minilap)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Technique** | Abdominal approach using a Laparoscope. Uses **CO2**, N2O, or air to inflate abdomen. | Small abdominal incision (2.5–3 cm) above pubic hairline. Modified **Pomeroy technique**. |
| **Occlusion** | **Falope rings** (Silastic bands) or Clips. | Cutting and tying the tubes. |
| **Timing** | Interval sterilization (not usually recommended immediately postpartum). | Ideal for **Postpartum** (24-48 hrs) and Interval. |
| **Anesthesia** | Local/General. | Local Anesthesia. |
| **Setting** | Requires specialist (Gynaecologist) and specialized equipment. | Can be performed at **[[Primary Health Centre (PHC)]]** by trained MBBS doctor. |
| **Stay** | Shorter hospital stay (Band-aid surgery). | Slightly longer than laparoscopy but short. |

#### B. Timing of Operation
1.  **Interval:** Within 7 days of the menstrual period (follicular phase).
2.  **Postpartum:** Within 24 hours to 7 days of delivery.
3.  **Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP):** Concurrent with abortion.

#### C. Complications
*   **Major:** Hemorrhage, visceral injury, infection, anesthesia complications. Mortality is rare (approx 10/100,000) but higher than vasectomy.
*   **Long term:** Menstrual irregularities (controversial), risk of **[[Ectopic Pregnancy]]** if failure occurs.

#### D. Failure Rate
*   **Pearl Index:** 0.5 per 100 Women Years (HWY).

### 3. Government of India Guidelines (2013) for Sterilization

| Criteria | Female Sterilization | Male Sterilization |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Marital Status** | Married (or ever-married) | Married (or ever-married) |
| **Age** | **22 – 49 years** | **< 60 years** |
| **Children** | At least one child **> 1 year old** | At least one child **> 1 year old** |
| **Consent** | Voluntary, informed written consent | Voluntary, informed written consent |
| **Mental State** | Sound mind. (If mentally ill: Psychiatrist certification + Guardian consent) | Sound mind. |

> **Clinical Relevance:** **Consent of the spouse** is NOT legally mandatory in India for sterilization, though usually encouraged for family harmony. The individual's consent is supreme.

### 4. Comparison: Vasectomy vs. Tubectomy

| Feature | Vasectomy (Male) | Tubectomy (Female) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Complexity** | Simple, OPD procedure | Requires entry into abdominal cavity |
| **Cost** | Less expensive | More expensive |
| **Effectiveness** | Slightly higher (Lower failure rate) | High |
| **Immediate Sterility** | **NO** (Wait 3 months) | **YES** (Immediate) |
| **Reversibility** | Better success rate (microsurgery) | Difficult, lower success |
| **Mortality Risk** | Negligible | Rare, but present |

### 5. Important Initiatives

*   **Fixed Day Static Services:** FDS approach ensures sterilization services are available regularly (e.g., District Hospital: Twice a week; PHC: Monthly).
*   **[[Family Planning Indemnity Scheme]] (NFPIS):** Provides insurance cover for failure of sterilization, medical complications, or death following the procedure.
*   **Mission Parivar Vikas:** Focuses on high fertility districts to improve access to contraceptives, including sterilization.

### Mnemonic for Vasectomy Post-op Advice
**"WAIT"**
*   **W** - Wear scrotal support (T-bandage) for 15 days.
*   **A** - Avoid heavy lifting/cycling for 15 days.
*   **I** - Intercourse only with barrier (condom) initially.
*   **T** - Tests (Semen analysis) after 3 months/30 ejaculations to confirm sterility.
