# [[HOSPITAL WASTE MANAGEMENT]] > What is biomedical waste? What are the health hazards of improper handling of biomedical waste? Briefly describe the process of disposal from generation site to point of disposal of different categories of biomedical wastes.

### Definition of Biomedical Waste

According to the **Bio-Medical Waste Management Rules, 2016**, [[Biomedical Waste]] is defined as "any waste, which is generated during the diagnosis, treatment or immunization of human beings or animals or research activities pertaining thereto or in the production or testing of biologicals or in health camps."

It includes categories such as human anatomical waste, animal waste, microbiology/biotechnology waste, waste sharps, discarded medicines, soiled waste, liquid waste, and incineration ash.

### Health Hazards of Improper Handling

Exposure to hazardous healthcare waste can result in disease or injury. The hazards are classified as follows:

1.  **Infectious Hazards:**
    *   Pathogens can enter through punctures, abrasions, mucous membranes, inhalation, or ingestion.
    *   **Major Concern:** Transmission of **[[HIV]]**, **[[Hepatitis B]]** (HBV), and **[[Hepatitis C]]** (HCV).
    *   **Other infections:** Gastroenteritis (Salmonella, Shigella), Respiratory infections (TB, Strep. pneumoniae), skin infections, and meningitis.
    *   Bacteria resistant to antibiotics may spread from poorly managed waste.

2.  **Physical Hazards (Sharps Injury):**
    *   Risk of injury from [[Needle Stick Injury]] (needles, hypodermic needles), scalpels, blades, and broken glass.
    *   This is a primary route for blood-borne pathogen transmission to healthcare workers and rag pickers.

3.  **Chemical and Pharmaceutical Hazards:**
    *   Toxic, corrosive, flammable, or explosive chemicals (e.g., disinfectants like formaldehyde).
    *   **Cytotoxic drugs:** Can be mutagenic, teratogenic, or carcinogenic.
    *   **Heavy Metals:** Mercury (from broken thermometers/BP instruments) can cause neurotoxicity.

4.  **Genotoxic and Radioactive Hazards:**
    *   Exposure to radioactive isotopes or genotoxic substances can cause tissue damage, headache, dizziness, and long-term carcinogenic effects.

5.  **Public Sensitivity:**
    *   Visual impact of anatomical waste (body parts) in municipal bins causes public distress and aesthetic nuisance.

### Process of Disposal: From Generation to Final Disposal

The management of biomedical waste follows a strict protocol to ensure safety.

#### 1. Segregation (At Point of Generation)
This is the **most crucial step**. Waste must be separated into different categories at the site where it is generated (wards, OT, labs) to prevent mixing of infectious and non-infectious waste.
*   **Clinical Relevance:** Segregation reduces the volume of infectious waste requiring costly treatment (incineration) and prevents the contamination of general municipal waste.

#### 2. Collection and Color Coding
Waste is collected in specific color-coded containers/bags as per the BMW Rules 2016.

**Table: Color Coding and Disposal Options**

| Color Coding | Type of Waste | Treatment and Disposal Options |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Yellow Bag]]** (Non-chlorinated plastic bags) | • **Human Anatomical Waste:** Tissues, organs, body parts, fetus.<br>• **Animal Anatomical Waste.**<br>• **Soiled Waste:** Items contaminated with blood/body fluids (cotton, dressings, plaster casts).<br>• **Expired/Discarded Medicines:** Cytotoxic drugs.<br>• **Chemical Waste** & **Chemical Liquid Waste.**<br>• **Microbiology Waste.** | • **[[Incineration]]** (High temp >1200°C)<br>• **Plasma Pyrolysis**<br>• **Deep Burial** (only in rural/remote areas). |
| **[[Red Bag]]** (Non-chlorinated plastic bags/containers) | • **Contaminated Waste (Recyclable):** Wastes generated from disposable items such as tubing, bottles, intravenous tubes and sets, catheters, urine bags, syringes (without needles), vacutainers, and gloves. | • **[[Autoclaving]]** / Micro-waving / Hydroclaving<br>followed by<br>• **Shredding/Mutilation**<br>• Sold to authorized recyclers (for energy recovery/road making). |
| **[[White Container]]** (Translucent, Puncture-proof, Leak-proof) | • **Waste Sharps including Metals:** Needles, syringes with fixed needles, needles from needle tip cutter, scalpels, blades.<br>*(Note: Must be tamper-proof)* | • **Autoclaving** / Dry Heat Sterilization<br>followed by<br>• **Shredding/Mutilation** or Encapsulation.<br>• Sent to iron foundries or sanitary landfill/concrete waste sharp pit. |
| **[[Blue Container]]** (Cardboard boxes with blue marking) | • **Glassware:** Broken or discarded/contaminated glass (medicine vials, ampoules).<br>• **Metallic Body Implants.** | • Disinfection (Sodium Hypochlorite) or Autoclaving/Microwaving<br>• Then sent for **Recycling**. |

*(Note: **Black Bags** are no longer used for biomedical waste; they are used for general municipal waste)*

#### 3. Storage
*   Waste should not be stored for more than **48 hours**.
*   A dedicated, secure storage area within the hospital premises must be maintained, inaccessible to unauthorized persons and animals.

#### 4. Transportation
*   **On-site:** Trolleys or wheeled containers (color-coded) are used to move waste from wards to the central storage area.
*   **Off-site:** Transported to the Common Bio-medical Waste Treatment Facility (CBWTF) in dedicated, covered vehicles.

#### 5. Treatment
*   **Incineration:** High-temperature dry oxidation (800°C–1050°C +). Used for Yellow bag waste (Anatomical, Soiled).
*   **Autoclaving/Microwaving:** Wet thermal treatment to sterilize plastics and sharps (Red/White categories) before shredding.
*   **Chemical Treatment:** 1% to 2% Sodium Hypochlorite is used for liquid waste and disinfection of glass.
*   **Inertization:** Mixing pharmaceutical waste with cement and lime to minimize the migration of toxic substances.

#### 6. Final Disposal
*   **Landfill:** Incineration ash and treated solid waste are disposed of in secured sanitary landfills.
*   **Recycling:** Treated plastics (Red) and glass (Blue) are sent to authorized recyclers.
*   **Deep Burial:** Permitted only in rural/remote areas where no CBWTF is available.

### Mnemonics for Color Coding

*   **Y**ellow = **Y**ucky stuff (Human parts, pus, blood, poop-soiled items).
*   **R**ed = **R**ecyclable **R**ubber & **P**lastics (Catheters, IV sets).
*   **W**hite = **W**eapons (Sharps that can puncture/hurt: Needles, Scalpels).
*   **B**lue = **B**roken Glass & **B**ody Implants.
