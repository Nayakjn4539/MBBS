# [[Glaucoma]] > Optic Disc Changes in Glaucoma

### **Optic Disc Changes in Glaucoma**

Glaucomatous optic neuropathy is characterized by specific morphological changes in the [[optic nerve head]] (ONH) and the [[retinal nerve fiber layer]] (RNFL). These changes typically precede visual field loss (pre-perimetric glaucoma). The pathological hallmark is the loss of retinal ganglion cells and their axons, leading to excavation (cupping) of the optic disc.

### **1. General Features and Examination**

*   **Assessment Method**: The optic disc is best evaluated using [[slit lamp biomicroscopy]] with a high positive lens (+78D or +90D) or contact lens (e.g., [[Goldmann three-mirror contact lens]]) to obtain a stereoscopic view.
*   **Normal Disc**:
    *   Vertically oval shape.
    *   Pink neuroretinal rim.
    *   Central physiological cup (normal Cup:Disc ratio $\approx$ 0.3-0.4).
    *   **ISNT Rule**: Normally, the neuroretinal rim (NRR) thickness follows the pattern: **I**nferior > **S**uperior > **N**asal > **T**emporal.

### **2. Changes in the Optic Cup and Neuroretinal Rim (NRR)**

The most distinct feature of glaucoma is the enlargement of the cup due to the loss of neural tissue (cupping).

*   **Vertical Elongation of the Cup**:
    *   Cupping usually starts vertically because the superior and inferior poles of the disc are affected first.
    *   A vertical cup-to-disc ratio (C:D ratio) > 0.5 is suspicious.
*   **Asymmetry of C:D Ratio**:
    *   A difference in C:D ratio of **> 0.2** between the two eyes is highly suggestive of glaucoma.
*   **Thinning of Neuroretinal Rim (NRR)**:
    *   Glaucoma violates the **ISNT rule**.
    *   Loss of NRR typically occurs first in the inferotemporal and superotemporal sectors.
    *   **Polar Notching**: Focal excavation or "notching" of the rim (inferior or superior) is a pathognomonic sign.
*   **Saucerization**:
    *   The cup expands concentrically, retaining a shallow depth before deepening.

### **3. Vascular Signs of Glaucoma**

Changes in the retinal blood vessels as they traverse the optic disc are critical indicators of advanced damage.

| Sign | Description | Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bayonetting Sign** | Double angulation of blood vessels as they pass over the overhanging, steep edge of the cup. | Seen in advanced cupping with loss of neural support. |
| **Nasal Shifting** | The main retinal blood vessel trunk is pushed toward the nasal side of the disc. | Indicates progressive excavation. |
| **Baring of Circumlinear Vessels** | A gap appears between the superficial vessels (which originally skirted the cup margin) and the actual cup margin. | Indicates that the cup has enlarged beneath the vessel (acquired cupping). |
| **Disc Hemorrhages (Drance Hemorrhage)** | Splinter or flame-shaped hemorrhages at the disc margin (usually inferotemporal). | **Sign of activity/progression**; highly specific for normal tension glaucoma (NTG). |
| **Arterial Pulsation** | Visible pulsation of retinal arterioles at the disc. | Pathognomonic of very high [[intraocular pressure]] (IOP). |

**Clinical Implication:** [[Splinter hemorrhages]] typically precede visual field loss and indicate that the glaucoma is uncontrolled or progressing.

### **4. Structural and Peripapillary Changes**

#### **Laminar Dot Sign**
*   **Definition**: Visibility of the pores of the [[lamina cribrosa]] (sieve-like connective tissue) at the base of the cup.
*   **Mechanism**: Loss of neural tissue exposes the underlying lamina.
*   **Appearance**: Slit-like or dot-like fenestrations extending to the disc margin.

#### **Peripapillary Atrophy (PPA)**
Atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid surrounding the disc. It is divided into two zones:
1.  **Beta Zone ($\beta$-zone)**:
    *   Inner zone, directly abutting the disc margin.
    *   Characterized by visible sclera and choroidal vessels due to total atrophy of RPE and choriocapillaris.
    *   More specific for glaucoma; extent correlates with visual field loss.
2.  **Alpha Zone ($\alpha$-zone)**:
    *   Outer zone, surrounding the beta zone.
    *   Characterized by irregular hyper- and hypopigmentation.
    *   Less specific (can be seen in myopia and normal eyes).

#### **Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) Defects**
*   **Appearance**: Can be visualized using red-free light (green filter).
*   **Defects**: Appear as dark, wedge-shaped (slit-like) defects radiating from the disc.
*   **Pattern**: Follows the arcuate nerve fiber bundles; earliest defects are often inferotemporal.

### **5. Advanced Glaucomatous Changes**

In end-stage glaucoma, the following may be observed:
*   **Total Cupping**: The cup extends to the disc margin (C:D ratio $\approx$ 1.0).
*   **Bean-pot Cupping**: The excavation undermines the disc margin (seen on OCT/histology).
*   **Glaucomatous Optic Atrophy**:
    *   The disc appears white and deeply excavated.
    *   Also known as **Cavernous Optic Atrophy (Schnabel’s Atrophy)**: Characterized by formation of lacunae (caverns) containing mucoid material in the optic nerve, differing from the proliferation of glial tissue seen in other atrophies.

### **6. Differential Diagnosis of Optic Disc Cupping**

Not all cupping is glaucoma. It is vital to distinguish glaucomatous cupping from other causes.

| Feature | **Glaucomatous Cupping** | **Non-Glaucomatous/Physiological Cupping** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pallor vs. Cupping** | **Cupping > Pallor** (Pallor is limited to the area of cupping). | **Pallor > Cupping** (Pallor extends beyond the cup into the rim). |
| **Neuroretinal Rim** | Thinned/Notched (violates ISNT rule). | Intact/Normal thickness. |
| **Disc Margin** | Bayonetting sign present. | No bayonetting. |
| **Hemorrhages** | Disc hemorrhages present. | Usually absent. |
| **Symmetry** | Often asymmetrical (>0.2). | Usually symmetrical. |
| **Visual Field** | Arcuate/Nasal step defects. | Variable or central defects. |

**Important Rule:** If the pallor of the disc is greater than the cupping, suspect **non-glaucomatous optic atrophy** (e.g., compressive lesions, arteritic ischemia).
