# [[MEDICINE & SOCIAL SCIENCE]] > Crowd and mob are different

### Crowd and Mob: Sociological Differences

In [[Social Sciences]], both crowds and mobs are classified as **Temporary Social Groups**. While they share the characteristic of being unstable and short-lived, there are distinct differences in their psychological makeup, leadership, and behavior.

#### 1. The Crowd
A **crowd** is defined as a group of people coming together temporarily for a short period, motivated by a common interest or curiosity,.

*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Motivation:** It gathers due to a specific event or shared curiosity (e.g., witnessing a street play, a magic show, or a road accident).
    *   **Leadership:** A crowd **lacks** internal organization and leadership,.
    *   **Stability:** It is unstable; once the event of interest is over, the crowd disperses naturally.
    *   **Emotion:** Generally, the emotional level is lower compared to a mob.

#### 2. The Mob
A **mob** is essentially a crowd that has become emotionally charged and is often driven to action by a specific catalyst or leader.

*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Leadership:** Unlike a crowd, a mob has a **leader** who forces or incites the members into action,.
    *   **Emotion:** A mob is highly **emotional** and impulsive. The collective behavior often overrides individual judgment.
    *   **Symbolism:** There may be a symbol involved, such as a flag or a slogan, which unites the group.
    *   **Stability:** Like a crowd, it is unstable and lacks formal internal organization. It usually disperses once the specific purpose (often destructive or aggressive) is achieved.

#### Comparison Table: Crowd vs. Mob

| Feature | [[Crowd]] | [[Mob]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nature** | Temporary gathering of people. | Emotionally charged gathering. |
| **Motivation** | Common interest or curiosity. | Strong emotion/anger/intent to act. |
| **Leadership** | **Absent.** Lacks defined leadership. | **Present.** Has a leader inciting action. |
| **Organization** | Unorganized. | Unorganized but directed. |
| **Example** | Spectators at a cricket match. | A group inciting a riot or violence. |

> **Note on "The Herd":**
> There is a third category called a **Herd**. This is also a crowd with a leader, but here the members follow the orders of the leader **without question** (e.g., a tourist group following a guide),.

#### Clinical and Medico-Legal Relevance
*   **Disaster Management:** Understanding crowd psychology is vital for preventing **stampedes** during mass gatherings (e.g., religious pilgrimages like Kumbh Mela).
*   **Psychiatry:** Mob mentality leads to a loss of individual responsibility (deindividuation), which is relevant in forensic psychiatry when analyzing crimes committed during riots.
*   **Public Health:** Mobs can lead to mass casualty incidents requiring [[Triage]] and rapid emergency response.
