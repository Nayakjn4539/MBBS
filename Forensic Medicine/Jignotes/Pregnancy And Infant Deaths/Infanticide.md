# [[Pregnancy And Infant Deaths]] > Infanticide

### Definition of Infanticide

**Infanticide** is defined as the unlawful killing of a child under the age of one year. 

*   **Legal Distinction:**
    *   **In England (Infanticide Act 1938):** A specific offense where a mother kills her child (under 12 months) while her mind is disturbed by the effects of childbirth or lactation. It is treated similarly to manslaughter/culpable homicide rather than murder.
    *   **In India:** There is **no distinction** between infanticide and murder. It is treated as **Murder** under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The law does not give any special concession to the mother due to post-partum mental state in the definition of the crime itself.

#### Related Terminologies
*   **[[Feticide]]:** The killing of a fetus at any time *prior* to birth.
*   **[[Neonaticide]]:** The killing of a newborn child within the first 24 hours of birth.
*   **[[Filicide]]:** The killing of a child by its own parents (includes older children).

### Legal Provisions in India

Since Infanticide is not a separate offense in the Indian Penal Code (IPC), related crimes are prosecuted under the following sections:

| Section (IPC) | Offense Description | Punishment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sec 302 IPC** | **Murder:** Intentional killing of a live-born infant. Applies to acts of commission (e.g., strangulation, smothering). | Death or Life Imprisonment + Fine |
| **Sec 304 IPC** | **Culpable Homicide not amounting to murder:** Acts done with knowledge/intent but without premeditation or under specific exceptions. | Life Imprisonment or up to 10 years |
| **Sec 315 IPC** | **Prevention of live birth/causing death after birth:** Act done with intent to prevent a child from being born alive or to cause it to die after birth (unless for saving mother's life). | Imprisonment up to 10 years or Fine or Both |
| **Sec 317 IPC** | **Exposure/Abandonment:** Parents/caretakers exposing or leaving a child under 12 years with intention to abandon. | Imprisonment up to 7 years or Fine or Both |
| **Sec 318 IPC** | **Concealment of Birth:** Secretly burying or disposing of the dead body of a child (whether dead born, stillborn, or died after birth) to conceal the birth. | Imprisonment up to 2 years or Fine or Both |

> **Note:** For a charge of Murder (Infanticide), it must be proved that the child was **[[Live Born]]** (completely expelled and showed signs of life). If the child died *in utero* or during birth (before complete expulsion), it is not murder, though it may fall under Sec 315 or 312 (Causing Miscarriage).

### Medico-Legal Questions to be Answered

In any case of alleged infanticide, the medical expert must answer the following **four** key questions to establish the crime:

1.  **Is the fetus/infant [[Viability|Viable]]?**
    *   **Definition:** Physical ability of the fetus to lead a separate existence after birth.
    *   **Criteria:** Generally accepted as **210 days (7 months)** or **28 weeks** of gestation.
    *   **Signs:** Length > 35 cm, Weight > 1.1 kg, Eyelids open, Testes descended/Labia minora covered.

2.  **Was the child Dead Born, Stillborn, or Live Born?**
    *   **[[Dead Born]]:** Died *in utero* (maceration present).
    *   **[[Stillborn]]:** Born after 28 weeks, but did not breathe or show signs of life *after* complete expulsion.
    *   **[[Live Born]]:** Showed signs of life (respiration, heart beat, pulsation of cord, movement) after complete expulsion.

3.  **If live born, how long did the child survive?**
    *   Determined by changes in the umbilical cord, circulation changes (closure of foramen ovale/ductus arteriosus), and stomach contents (milk).

4.  **What was the cause of death?**
    *   Was it Natural, Accidental (e.g., precipitate labor), or Criminal (Infanticide)?

### Classification of Causes of Infant Death

When investigating infanticide, one must distinguish between criminal acts and natural/accidental causes.

#### 1. Acts of Omission (Criminal Negligence)
A woman/parent is guilty if they fail to take ordinary precautions to save the child.
*   **Failure to provide assistance:** Birth in secrecy without aid may lead to suffocation in fluids.
*   **Failure to clear airways:** Not removing amniotic fluid/mucus from mouth/nose.
*   **Failure to tie the cord:** Can lead to fatal hemorrhage (though spontaneous clotting usually prevents this).
*   **Failure to protect from environment:** Exposure to extreme heat or cold (Hypothermia).
*   **Starvation:** Deliberate failure to feed the infant.

#### 2. Acts of Commission (Active Violence)
Positive acts done to kill the infant.
*   **[[Smothering]]:** Closing mouth and nostrils with hand, pillow, or cloth. Commonest method.
*   **[[Strangulation]]:** Using a ligature (often the umbilical cord) or manual throttling.
*   **Drowning:** Disposing of the infant in a bucket, tank, or well. Sometimes pleaded as accidental birth into a lavatory pan (precipitate labor).
*   **Head Injury:** Dashing the head against a wall or floor.
*   **Concealed Puncture Wounds:** Piercing fontanelles, inner canthus of the eye, or nape of the neck with needles/pins (hard to detect).
*   **Twisting the Neck:** Causes fracture-dislocation of cervical vertebrae (C1-C2).
*   **Poisoning:** Smearing opium or tobacco on nipples (rare).

### Autopsy Findings in Infanticide

The autopsy aims to prove *live birth* and *cause of death*.

#### 1. Establishing Live Birth
*   **External Signs:** Chest is arched/drum-shaped (in live born) vs flat (in stillborn).
*   **Hydrostatic Test ([[Raygat's Test]]):** The lungs float in water if respiration has occurred. (Caution: Decomposition can cause false positives).
*   **[[Breslau's Second Life Test]]:** Stomach and intestines float in water if air was swallowed (life occurred).
*   **Histology of Lungs:** Alveoli are expanded and lined by flattened epithelium (live born) vs gland-like appearance with cuboidal epithelium (stillborn).

#### 2. Specific Injury Patterns
*   **Smothering:** Abrasions/bruises around the mouth/nose; flattening of nose.
*   **Throttling:** Crescentic nail marks on the neck; bruising of strap muscles; hyoid fracture (rare in infants due to non-ossification).
*   **Umbilical Cord:** Check if cut cleanly (sharp weapon) or torn (precipitate labor/violence). Check for vital reaction at the severed end.
*   **Precipitate Labor vs. Violence:** 
    *   *Precipitate Labor:* Injuries mostly on the vertex (presenting part). Cord torn near the placental end.
    *   *Violence:* Injuries can be anywhere. Cord may be cut or torn near the umbilicus.
