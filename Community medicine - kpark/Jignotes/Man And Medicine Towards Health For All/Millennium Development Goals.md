### **Transition to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**

*   The time frame for MDGs ended in **December 2015**.
*   While significant progress was made (e.g., reduction in child mortality and poverty), many targets were not fully met.
*   They were succeeded by the **[[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs)**, also known as **Agenda 2030**, adopted by the UN General Assembly in September 2015.
*   Unlike MDGs which focused on developing countries, SDGs are universally applicable to all countries.
*   There are **17 SDGs** compared to 8 MDGs.
