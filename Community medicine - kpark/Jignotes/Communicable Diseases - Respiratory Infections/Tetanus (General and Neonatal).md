# [[Communicable Diseases - Respiratory Infections]] > Tetanus (General and Neonatal)

### **Tetanus (Lockjaw)**

[[Tetanus]] is an acute, often fatal disease caused by the exotoxin of *Clostridium tetani*, characterized by muscular rigidity and painful paroxysmal spasms of voluntary muscles. It is a major public health problem, particularly **Neonatal Tetanus** in developing countries.

### **1. Epidemiological Determinants**

#### **A. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent**: *[[Clostridium tetani]]*.
    *   **Characteristics**: Gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-bearing bacillus.
    *   **Appearance**: Terminal spores give it a **"Drum-stick"** appearance.
*   **Toxin**: Produces a potent exotoxin called **[[Tetanospasmin]]**.
    *   It is the **second most lethal toxin** known to man (after Botulinum toxin).
    *   **Mechanism**: Blocks inhibition of spinal reflexes at motor endplates, spinal cord, brain, and sympathetic system.
*   **Resistance**: Spores are highly resistant to boiling, phenol, and drying. They survive in soil for years. Killed by **autoclaving at 120°C for 20 minutes**.
*   **Reservoir**: **Soil** and dust (natural habitat). Also found in the intestine of herbivorous animals (cattle, horses) and humans.

#### **B. Host Factors**
*   **Age**:
    *   **Active Age (5-40 years)**: High risk due to trauma/injury.
    *   **Newborns**: Risk of **Neonatal Tetanus** due to unhygienic delivery practices.
*   **Sex**: Higher incidence in males, but females are at risk during delivery (Puerperal Tetanus).
*   **Immunity**:
    *   **[[Herd Immunity]] does NOT protect the individual** in tetanus.
    *   Immunity is acquired *only* through active immunization. Recovery from clinical tetanus does *not* confer natural immunity (toxin dose is too low to stimulate antibody production).

#### **C. Environmental Factors**
*   Common in areas with agricultural practices, contact with soil/animal dung.
*   Unhygienic customs like applying cow dung or dust to wounds/umbilical stump.

---

### **2. Mode of Transmission**
*   **Direct Inoculation**: Infection is acquired by contamination of wounds with tetanus spores.
    *   **Portal of Entry**: Trivial pinpricks, abrasions, puncture wounds, burns, unsterile surgery, ear infections (otogenic), and umbilical stump (neonatal).
*   **Communicability**: **None**. It is **not** transmitted from person to person.

---

### **3. Incubation Period**
*   **Duration**: Usually **6–10 days** (Range: 1 day to several months).
*   **Prognosis**: The *shorter* the incubation period, the *worse* the prognosis.

---

### **4. Clinical Types & Features**

#### **A. General Tetanus**
*   **Trismus (Lockjaw)**: Spasm of masseter muscles (earliest sign).
*   **Risus Sardonicus**: Spasm of facial muscles (sarcastic smile).
*   **Opisthotonos**: Arched back due to spasm of back muscles.
*   **Rigidity**: Board-like abdominal rigidity.
*   **Spasms**: Painful paroxysmal spasms triggered by noise or light.

#### **B. Neonatal Tetanus (Tetanus Neonatorum)**
*   **Synonym**: **"8th Day Disease"** (Symptoms usually appear around the 7th–8th day).
*   **Cause**: Infection of the umbilical stump due to unhygienic delivery practices (cutting cord with unsterile blade, applying ash/dung).
*   **Clinical Signs**:
    *   Normal ability to suck/cry for the first 2 days.
    *   Inability to suck (trismus) appearing between days 3–28.
    *   Generalized rigidity and spasms.
*   **Fatality**: Extremely high (80-90%) without treatment.

---

### **5. Prevention and Control**

#### **A. Active Immunization**
*   **Vaccine**: **[[Tetanus Toxoid]] (TT)** or Td (Tetanus-diphtheria).
*   **Schedule (Universal Immunization Programme - India)**:
    *   **Infants**: **Pentavalent Vaccine** (DPT + HepB + Hib) at 6, 10, 14 weeks.
    *   **Booster**: DPT at 16-24 months and 5-6 years.
    *   **Children/Adolescents**: **TT/Td** at 10 years and 16 years.
    *   **Pregnant Women**:
        *   **Early in pregnancy**: TT/Td-1.
        *   **4 weeks later**: TT/Td-2.
        *   **Booster**: If vaccinated within the last 3 years, only 1 dose is required.

#### **B. Passive Immunization**
*   Used for temporary protection in non-immune persons with injuries.
*   **Human Tetanus Immunoglobulin (TIG)**: Dose **250 IU** (Best prophylactic).
*   **Equine Anti-Tetanus Serum (ATS)**: Dose **1500 IU** (Risk of anaphylaxis, test dose required).

#### **C. Prevention of Tetanus in Wounded (Guidelines)**
Decision depends on the nature of the wound and immunity status.

| **Immunity Category** | **Clean, Minor Wounds (<6 hours)** | **Contaminated / Other Wounds** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A (Complete imm. < 5 yrs)** | Nothing required | Nothing required |
| **B (Complete imm. > 5-10 yrs)** | TT (1 dose) | TT (1 dose) |
| **C (Complete imm. > 10 yrs)** | TT (1 dose) | TT (1 dose) + TIG |
| **D (Unknown / Unimmunized)** | Complete Course (TT) | Complete Course (TT) + TIG |

#### **D. Prevention of Neonatal Tetanus (MNT Elimination)**
Achieved through the **"5 Cleans"** (formerly 3 cleans) during delivery:
1.  **Clean Hands** (of attendant).
2.  **Clean Surface** (for delivery).
3.  **Clean Blade** (for cutting cord).
4.  **Clean Cord Tie**.
5.  **Clean Cord Stump** (No application of anything).
*   *(Note: 7 Cleans add Clean Water and Clean Towel).*

*   **Maternal Immunization**: Vaccinating pregnant women with TT/Td prevents neonatal tetanus via transplacental antibody transfer.

---

### **6. Elimination Status**
*   **Target**: Elimination of Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus (MNTE) defined as **<1 case of NT per 1000 live births** in every district.
*   **Status**: India was declared free of Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus in **August 2015**.
