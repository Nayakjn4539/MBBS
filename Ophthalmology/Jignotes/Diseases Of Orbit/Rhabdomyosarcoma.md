# Rhabdomyosarcoma

### Overview
[[Rhabdomyosarcoma]] is a highly malignant tumor of the [[Orbit]].
*   **Origin:** Arises from **pluripotent mesenchymal cells** which have the potential to differentiate into [[Striated Muscle]] cells.
*   **Epidemiology:**
    *   **Most common primary malignant orbital tumor in children**.
    *   Most common [[Primary Orbital Tumor]] in children overall (benign + malignant) is [[Capillary Hemangioma]], but for malignant, it is Rhabdomyosarcoma.
    *   **Age:** Usually occurs in the **first decade** of life (average age 7–8 years). 90% of cases occur below 15 years of age.
    *   **Gender:** Slight male preponderance.

### Histological Classification
There are four main histological types:

| Type | Frequency | Characteristics | Prognosis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Embryonal** | **Most Common** (60%) | Composed of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells. | **Good prognosis** with chemotherapy. |
| **Alveolar** | Common (31%) | Cells arranged in alveolar pattern. | **Most Aggressive**; Worst prognosis. |
| **Botryoid** | Rare (6%) | Grape-like clusters; variant of embryonal. | Variable. |
| **Pleomorphic** | Least Common (3%) | Also called **Anaplastic**. Usually seen in adults. | **Best Prognosis** (according to some classifications), but rare. |

### Clinical Features
The clinical presentation often mimics an acute inflammatory process due to its speed of growth.

*   **Onset:** **Rapidly progressive** [[Unilateral Proptosis]] of sudden onset.
*   **Location:** Can invade any part of the orbit, but most commonly involves the **superonasal quadrant**.
*   **Signs:**
    *   Mass in the orbit.
    *   **Eyelid edema** and redness (mimics [[Orbital Cellulitis]]).
    *   Proptosis (axial or non-axial depending on location).
    *   No bone destruction in early stages (unlike [[Lacrimal Gland Tumors]] or [[Metastasis]]), but may be seen later.
*   **History:** Short duration of symptoms.

### Differential Diagnosis
Due to the rapid onset and signs of inflammation, it is often misdiagnosed.
1.  **[[Orbital Cellulitis]]:** Differentiated by fever, leukocytosis, and response to antibiotics (Rhabdomyosarcoma does not respond).
2.  **[[Neuroblastoma]] (Metastatic):** Often presents with bilateral proptosis and lid ecchymosis.
3.  **[[Chloroma]] (Acute Myeloid Leukemia):** Can present as a rapidly growing orbital mass.
4.  **[[Lymphangioma]]:** May present with sudden proptosis due to spontaneous hemorrhage (chocolate cyst).

### Investigations
1.  **[[CT Scan]]:**
    *   Shows an irregular, well-defined soft tissue mass.
    *   May show adjacent **bone destruction**.
2.  **[[Biopsy]]:**
    *   **Confirmatory test**.
    *   Essential to establish histopathological diagnosis.
3.  **Systemic Investigation:**
    *   To rule out metastatic spread (Chest X-ray, Bone marrow biopsy, etc.).

### Treatment
Rhabdomyosarcoma is a **radiosensitive** and **chemosensitive** tumor.

**1. Radiotherapy**
*   High dose **local radiotherapy** (5000 rads in 5 weeks).
*   Combined with systemic chemotherapy for effective management.

**2. Chemotherapy**
*   Standard line of treatment.
*   Especially effective for **Embryonal sarcoma**.
*   **Regimen:** Combination of drugs used for 2 years.
    *   **Vincristine**
    *   **Actinomycin D** (Dactinomycin)
    *   **Cyclophosphamide**

> **Mnemonic for Chemotherapy:** **VAC** (Vincristine, Actinomycin D, Cyclophosphamide).

**3. Surgery**
*   **Excision Biopsy:** Only possible for well-circumscribed, localized tumors (rare).
*   **[[Exenteration]]:** Reserved for:
    *   Rare, radiotherapy-resistant tumors.
    *   Unresponsive patients.
    *   Recurrences despite aggressive medical management.

### Prognosis
*   **Embryonal type:** Generally has a good prognosis with modern chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
*   **Alveolar type:** Poor prognosis due to aggressive nature.
*   Overall survival has improved significantly with multimodal therapy.

**Clinical Implication:** Any child presenting with rapidly progressive proptosis should be suspected of having Rhabdomyosarcoma until proven otherwise. It should not be dismissed simply as an inflammatory condition without proper investigation because early diagnosis significantly improves survival.
