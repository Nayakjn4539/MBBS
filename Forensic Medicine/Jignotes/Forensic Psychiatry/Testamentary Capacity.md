# [[Forensic Psychiatry]] > Testamentary Capacity

### [[Testamentary Capacity]]

**Definition**
Testamentary capacity refers to the mental ability and legal competency of a person to make a valid [[Will]]. It determines whether an individual has a "sound disposing mind" at the time of executing the document.

**Requirements of a Valid Will**
For a will to be legally valid in a court of law, the following criteria must be met:
1.  **Written Document:** It must be a properly signed and witnessed document.
2.  **Majority:** The testator (person making the will) must be a major (>18 years).
3.  **Sound Mind:** The person must be of a "sound disposing mind".
4.  **Free Volition:** It must be made voluntarily, without force, fraud, undue influence, or dishonest representation of facts by others.

### Criteria for "Sound Disposing Mind"
A testator is considered to be of sound mind if they possess the following capabilities at the time of making the will:
*   **Understanding the Nature of the Act:** The person must understand that they are making a will and what that legal act implies.
*   **Knowledge of Property:** They must know the nature, extent, and value of their property/assets.
*   **Knowledge of Beneficiaries:** They must recognize the "natural objects of their bounty," i.e., the persons who have a natural claim on their property (spouse, children, relatives).
*   **Distribution:** They must understand the manner in which the property is being distributed.
*   **Freedom from Delusion:** The mind must be free from any [[Insane Delusion]] that directly influences the disposal of the property or affects the provisions of the will.

### Assessment by the Medical Practitioner
When a doctor is called to certify the mental capacity of a testator, the following protocol should be followed:

**1. Preliminaries**
*   **Examination:** Conduct a thorough physical and mental status examination.
*   **Privacy:** Ask all other persons (relatives, lawyers) to leave the room to ensure the patient is not under pressure or undue influence.
*   **Timing:** Record the exact date and time of the examination.

**2. Testing Mental Capacity**
The doctor should ask specific questions to test the "disposing mind":
*   **Awareness:** Test orientation to time, place, and person.
*   **Property:** Ask the testator to list their assets (houses, bank accounts, lands) and their approximate value.
*   **Beneficiaries:** Ask about family members, friends, or business partners to ensure memory is intact regarding relatives.
*   **Distribution:** Ask how they wish to distribute the property. If the distribution seems unjust or unusual (e.g., disinheriting a child), ask for the *reasons*. If the reason is rational (even if harsh), the capacity is valid. If the reason is based on a [[Delusion]], it is invalid.
*   **Repetition:** Ask the patient to repeat the main provisions of the will to check for consistency and memory.
*   **Concentration:** Test powers of concentration (e.g., simple arithmetic sums).

**3. Exclusion of Incapacitating Factors**
The doctor must rule out conditions that affect judgment, such as:
*   Influence of [[Alcohol]] or drugs.
*   Severe pain or strain.
*   Acute [[Delirium]] or confusion.
*   Presence of insane delusions affecting the will.

### Specific Clinical Scenarios

| Condition | Validity of Will | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Lucid Interval]]** | **Valid** | A mentally ill person can make a valid will during a lucid interval (period of sanity). |
| **[[Insane Delusion]]** | **Conditionally Valid** | Valid *only if* the delusion is **not** related to the property or the persons involved in the will. If the delusion dictates the will (e.g., a father disinherits a son because a delusion tells him the son is a demon), it is invalid. |
| **[[Aphasia]] / Agraphia** | **Valid** | A person who cannot speak or write (e.g., stroke) can make a will if they can clearly communicate their wishes through gestures/signs and understand the proceedings. |
| **Physical Infirmity** | **Valid** | Physical weakness, extreme old age, or trembling hands do not invalidate a will if the mind is sound and memory is intact. |
| **[[Delirium]]** | **Invalid** | A will executed by a dying person while in a state of delirium is invalid due to clouding of consciousness. |
| **In Extremis** | **Invalid** | Wills made by persons nearing death who have lost cognitive function are invalid. |
| **Intoxication** | **Invalid** | If drunkenness causes temporary loss of reasoning power, the will is invalid. |

### Important Terminologies

*   **[[Testator]]:** The person making the will.
*   **Legatee:** The beneficiary (person receiving the property).
*   **Executor:** The person appointed by the testator to carry out the instructions of the will after death.
*   **Holograph Will:** A will written entirely in the testator's own handwriting. It is generally considered valid evidence of capacity as it requires sustained mental effort.

### Medicolegal Aspects

*   **Burden of Proof:** The law presumes every person is sane. If a will is challenged, the burden of proving that the testator lacked [[Testamentary Capacity]] lies with the person challenging the will (usually a disinherited relative).
*   **Doctor as Witness:** The attesting doctor may be called to court to testify regarding the mental state of the testator at the precise time the will was signed.
*   **Refusal:** A doctor should refuse to certify if the patient is confused, delirious, unconscious, or under the influence of drugs/alcohol that impair judgment.
*   **Prejudice vs. Delusion:** Dislike of relatives, moral perversion, or eccentric habits do not constitute incapacity. A man may disinherit his family out of hatred; this is valid unless the hatred stems from an insane delusion.
