# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > A 10-year-old boy, scratch by street cat on left leg with oozing of scanty blood. Wound was washed casually. Write down line of management for the boy in present situation. Describe preventive measures for controlling the disease.

### Line of Management

The clinical scenario presents a **Category III exposure** (scratch with oozing of blood) by a potential rabies vector (street cat). This is a medical emergency requiring immediate and comprehensive **Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)**.

**1. Local Wound Treatment (First Aid)**
*   **Immediate Washing:** Thoroughly flush and wash the scratch wound with plenty of soap and running water for at least **15 minutes**. If soap is unavailable, use flush with water alone.,,,
*   **Chemical Treatment:** After washing, apply a virucidal agent such as **70% alcohol**, **tincture**, or **0.01% aqueous povidone-iodine** to the wound.,,,
*   **Avoid Suturing:** Do **not** suture the wound immediately. If suturing is unavoidable (e.g., for cosmetic reasons or heavy bleeding), it should be done 24–48 hours later, with loose sutures, *only* after infiltrating [[Rabies Immunoglobulin]] around the wound.,,,

**2. Specific Immunoprophylaxis**
Since this is a Category III exposure involving a stray animal (street cat), both **passive** (immunoglobulin) and **active** (vaccine) immunization are mandatory.

*   **Passive Immunization ([[Rabies Immunoglobulin]] - RIG):**
    *   **Purpose:** To neutralize the virus locally at the wound site before it enters the nerve endings.,
    *   **Dosage:** 
        *   **Human Rabies Immunoglobulin (HRIG):** 20 IU per kg body weight.,,
        *   **Equine Rabies Immunoglobulin (ERIG):** 40 IU per kg body weight (Requires prior sensitivity testing).,,
    *   **Administration:** Infiltrate as much of the calculated dose as possible **into and around the wound**. Inject the remainder intramuscularly (IM) at a site distant from the vaccine injection site (e.g., gluteal region).,,,

*   **Active Immunization ([[Anti-Rabies Vaccine]] - ARV):**
    *   Start immediately (Day 0). Do not wait for the animal observation period as it is a stray cat.,
    *   **Route & Site:** Intramuscular (Deltoid muscle) or Intradermal. **Never** in the gluteal region for vaccine.,,
    *   **Schedule Options:**
        *   **Intramuscular (Essen Regimen):** 5 doses on Days **0, 3, 7, 14, and 28**.,,,
        *   **Intradermal (Updated Thai Red Cross Regimen):** 0.1 ml at 2 sites on Days **0, 3, 7, and 28** (2-2-2-0-2 schedule).,,,

**3. Supportive Treatment**
*   **Tetanus Prophylaxis:** Administer Tetanus Toxoid (TT) if the child is not fully immunized or if the last dose was >5 years ago.,,
*   **Antibiotics:** Prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial infection from the cat scratch.,,

### Preventive Measures for Controlling Rabies

**1. Control of Reservoir (Urban Rabies Control)**
*   **Elimination of Strays:** Humanely reduce the population of stray and ownerless dogs and cats.,,
*   **Mass Vaccination:** Swift mass immunization of at least **80%** of the dog/cat population in the area to break the transmission cycle.,,
*   **Registration & Licensing:** Compulsory registration and licensing of all domestic pet dogs and cats.,
*   **Restraint:** Enforce restraint of pets in public places and use of muzzles.,
*   **Quarantine:** Imported dogs/cats should be quarantined for 6 months.,

**2. Human Protection**
*   **Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP):** Recommended for high-risk groups like veterinarians, animal handlers, and laboratory workers.
    *   *Schedule:* 3 doses on Days 0, 7, and 21 (or 28).,,
*   **Health Education:** Educate the community and children about avoiding contact with unknown animals and the importance of immediate wound washing after a bite/scratch.,

### Clinical Relevance
**Mnemonics for Rabies Management:**
*   **W.A.S.H.** the Wound (Water, Soap/Alcohol, Suturing avoided, Help/Hospital).
*   **R.I.P.** (Rabies Immunoglobulin + Prophylaxis vaccine) for Category III.

**Important Note:** If the street cat can be captured and observed, and it remains healthy for **10 days**, PEP can be discontinued. However, due to the risk, prophylaxis is usually started immediately.,,
