# [[Oral Cavity]] > Warthin's Tumor

# Warthin's Tumor

**Synonyms:** [[Adenolymphoma]], [[Papillary Cystadenoma Lymphomatosum]].

### 1. Introduction and Epidemiology
*   **Prevalence:** It is the **second most common** benign neoplasm of the salivary glands (after [[Pleomorphic Adenoma]]).
*   **Site:** It occurs almost exclusively in the [[Parotid Gland]], specifically involving the **tail of the parotid**.
*   **Gender:** Strong male preponderance (Male:Female ratio ranges from 5:1 to as high as 26:1 in different studies).
*   **Age:** Commonly seen in the 5th to 7th decades of life (elderly males).
*   **Risk Factors:** Strong association with **Cigarette Smoking**.

### 2. Etiology and Pathogenesis
*   **Origin:** It is believed to arise from heterotopic salivary duct tissue trapped within **intraparotid lymph nodes** during embryological development.
*   **Viral Association:** [[Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV) has been implicated, but smoking is the most established environmental risk factor.

### 3. Clinical Features
*   **Presentation:** Presents as a painless, slow-growing swelling in the lower part (tail) of the [[Parotid Gland]].
*   **Consistency:** Usually soft, cystic, or firm. Can be compressible.
*   **Multiplicity:**
    *   **Bilateral:** Occurs bilaterally in approximately **10%** of cases (a unique feature among salivary tumors).
    *   **Multicentric:** May present as multiple lesions within the same gland.
*   **Symptoms:** Generally asymptomatic, but secondary infection can cause acute pain and rapid increase in size.
*   **Facial Nerve:** The [[Facial Nerve]] is **unaffected**.

### 4. Pathology
> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Histology showing double-layered epithelium with lymphoid stroma

#### Gross Appearance
*   **Capsule:** Encapsulated tumor.
*   **Surface:** Smooth or lobulated.
*   **Cut Surface:** Cystic spaces containing **mucoid or brownish fluid** (often described as "motor oil" appearance).
*   **Solid Areas:** White or greyish solid areas representing lymphoid tissue.

#### Histopathology
The tumor has a characteristic "double-layer" appearance:
1.  **Epithelial Component:** Double-layered epithelium (inner columnar/oncocytic cells and outer basal cells) forming papillary projections into cystic spaces. The cells are **Oncocytes** (acidophilic cells rich in mitochondria).
2.  **Stromal Component:** Abundant **lymphoid tissue** (lymphocytes) often with germinal centers.

### 5. Investigations

| Investigation | Findings | Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FNAC** | Cystic fluid, oncocytes, and lymphocytes. | Useful for preoperative diagnosis. |
| **[[Technetium-99m Pertechnetate Scan]]** | Shows increased uptake ("**Hot Nodule**"). | **Pathognomonic** for Warthin's tumor and [[Oncocytoma]]. |
| **MRI** | Well-defined lesion. Low signal on T1, heterogeneous high signal on T2 (due to microcysts). | Evaluates extent and deep lobe involvement. |
| **Ultrasound** | Well-defined, hypoechoic, or cystic lesion. | Initial screening. |

### 6. Treatment
*   **Surgery:** The treatment of choice is surgical excision.
    *   **[[Superficial Parotidectomy]]:** The standard procedure to ensure complete removal and preservation of the [[Facial Nerve]].
    *   **Enucleation:** Unlike pleomorphic adenoma, Warthin's tumor can sometimes be enucleated (shelled out) without a high risk of recurrence, provided it is distinct and encapsulated.
*   **Conservative:** In elderly, high-risk patients with small asymptomatic lesions, a "wait and watch" policy may be adopted after confirming diagnosis via FNAC.

### 7. Prognosis
*   **Recurrence:** Rare after adequate excision.
*   **Malignant Transformation:** Very rare (approx. 0.3%). If it occurs, it may transform into lymphoma or carcinoma.

### 8. Comparison: Pleomorphic Adenoma vs. Warthin's Tumor

| Feature | [[Pleomorphic Adenoma]] | [[Warthin's Tumor]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frequency** | Most common (80%) | 2nd Most common |
| **Gender** | Females > Males | Males > Females (Smokers) |
| **Bilaterality** | Rare | Common (10%) |
| **Radionuclide Scan** | Cold Nodule | **Hot Nodule** |
| **Microscopy** | Epithelial + Myxochondroid stroma | Double-layered epithelium + Lymphoid stroma |
| **Malignant Potential** | 2–10% (Carcinoma ex-pleomorphic adenoma) | Very rare (<1%) |

### Clinical Implications
*   **"Hot Nodule" Alert:** If a technetium scan of the parotid shows a "Hot Nodule," the diagnosis is almost certainly **Warthin's Tumor** or **Oncocytoma**. Most other tumors (benign and malignant) appear as "Cold Nodules".
*   **Smoking History:** Always inquire about smoking history in elderly males presenting with a cystic parotid mass.
