# Surveillance in Malaria

In the context of the [[National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme]] (NVBDCP), surveillance is the backbone of malaria control and elimination strategies. It implies the continuing scrutiny of all aspects of occurrence and spread of disease that are pertinent to effective control.

### 1. Types of Surveillance Mechanisms

The malaria surveillance system in India was established in the early 1960s and currently operates through the following methods:

**1. Active Case Detection (ACD)**
*   **Definition:** The health system seeks out "actively" the collection of data by going out to the community.
*   **Mechanism:** [[Multipurpose Worker]] (Male) or ANM performs domiciliary house-to-house visits every **fortnight** (every 14 days).
*   **Action:** They inquire about fever cases, collect blood smears (or perform RDTs), and administer presumptive treatment.
*   **Scope:** Primarily carried out in rural areas.

**2. Passive Case Detection (PCD)**
*   **Definition:** Data is reported when patients visit health facilities on their own.
*   **Mechanism:** Collection of blood slides from all fever cases reporting to sub-centres, [[Primary Health Centre]] (PHC), Community Health Centres (CHC), hospitals, and dispensaries.
*   **Role of Volunteers:** [[ASHA]], Drug Distribution Centres (DDCs), and Fever Treatment Depots (FTDs) also contribute to PCD by providing diagnostic services (RDTs) and treatment.

**3. Sentinel Surveillance**
*   **Purpose:** To capture data not easily identified by the routine system, specifically **severe malaria cases** and **malaria-related deaths**.
*   **Sites:** Medical colleges or large district hospitals act as sentinel sites.
*   **Utility:** Helps in identifying missing cases and supplementing notified cases.

**4. Mass Blood Survey**
*   Examination of blood from all persons in a community.
*   **Indication:** Carried out during epidemiological investigation around positive cases or to detect asymptomatic parasitemia.

### 2. Malariometric Indicators (Surveillance Parameters)

These indices are crucial for measuring the burden of disease, operational efficiency, and potential outbreaks.

| Indicator | Formula | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Annual Parasite Incidence (API)** | $\frac{\text{Confirmed cases in one year}}{\text{Population under surveillance}} \times 1000$ | **Best indicator** of malaria burden. Used to stratify areas into High Risk ($API \ge 2$) or Low Risk. |
| **Annual Blood Examination Rate (ABER)** | $\frac{\text{No. of slides examined}}{\text{Population under surveillance}} \times 100$ | Index of **Operational Efficiency** of surveillance. Target is to screen $>10\%$ of population annually. |
| **Slide Positivity Rate (SPR)** | $\frac{\text{No. of slides positive}}{\text{Slides examined}} \times 100$ | Indicator of **Outbreak/Trend**. High SPR with low ABER indicates poor surveillance. |
| **Slide Falciparum Rate (SFR)** | $\frac{\text{No. of Pf positive slides}}{\text{Slides examined}} \times 100$ | Indicates the prevalence of *P. falciparum* specifically. |
| **Infant Parasite Rate (IPR)** | % of infants (<1 yr) showing parasites | Most **sensitive index** of *recent* transmission in a locality. |

**Mnemonic for Indicators:**
**"API Appraises, ABER Acts, SPR Signals"**
*   **API** **A**ppraises the burden (Impact indicator).
*   **ABER** checks if the system **A**cts efficiently (Operational indicator).
*   **SPR** **S**ignals an outbreak (Trend indicator).

### 3. Entomological (Vector) Surveillance

A malaria survey is incomplete without vector indices to understand transmission dynamics.

*   **Human Blood Index:** Proportion of female mosquitoes containing human blood (indicates degree of anthrophilism—preference for human blood).
*   **Sporozoite Rate:** Percentage of female anophelines with sporozoites in salivary glands (infective mosquitoes).
*   **Man-Biting Rate:** Average number of bites per person per day.
*   **Inoculation Rate:** Man-biting rate $\times$ Sporozoite rate (measures intensity of transmission).
*   **Vector Density:** Number of mosquitoes per man-hour catch.

### 4. New Strategies in Surveillance (Elimination Era)

Under the [[National Framework for Malaria Elimination]] (2016-2030), surveillance has shifted from control to elimination mode.

*   **Notification:** Mandatory notification of every malaria case from private and public sectors.
*   **Case-Based Surveillance:** Tracking every positive case to its source (investigation of foci) is required in elimination phase (Category 1 & 2 states).
*   **Mobile-Based Surveillance:** Introduction of mobile-based surveillance in tribal areas where routine services are unavailable (Tribal Malaria Action Plan).
*   **M-health:** Reporting system via **Integrated Health Information Platform (IHIP)** for real-time monitoring.
*   **Rapid Diagnostic Kits (RDTs):** Used for surveillance in remote/inaccessible areas where microscopy results cannot be available within 24 hours.

### 5. Clinical Relevance & Application

*   **Stratification:** Based on API, areas are stratified to decide interventions.
    *   **API > 2:** High risk. Requires Indoor Residual Spray (IRS) + LLINs (Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets).
    *   **API < 1:** Moving towards elimination phase.
*   **Epidemic Warning:** A rise in **SPR** (Slide Positivity Rate) often precedes an epidemic and serves as an early warning signal.
*   **Drug Resistance:** Surveillance also includes monitoring therapeutic efficacy to detect drug resistance (e.g., Chloroquine resistance in *P. falciparum*).
