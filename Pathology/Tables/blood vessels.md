| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Arteriosclerosis** Literally means “hardening of the arteries”; it is a generic term for arterial wall thickening and loss of elasticity. | - | - | Driven by inflammation or mechanical injury. Can be considered a healing response. | - | - | **Mönckeberg medial sclerosis**: Calcifications of the medial walls of muscular arteries, usually not clinically significant. | May cause downstream ischemic injury. | - | Four general patterns: 1. **Arteriolosclerosis**: Affects small arteries and arterioles. 2. **Mönckeberg medial sclerosis**: Medial calcifications. 3. **Fibromuscular intimal hyperplasia**: In muscular arteries larger than arterioles. 4. **Atherosclerosis**: Most frequent and important pattern. | Downstream ischemic injury, in-stent restenosis. | - |
| **Atherosclerosis** The most frequent and clinically important pattern of arteriosclerosis. An intimal-based lesion composed of a fibrous cap and a soft, grumous core of lipid (atheroma). | Multifactorial, involving an interplay of vessel wall injury and inflammation. | **Nonmodifiable (Constitutional):** • Genetics (family history) • Increasing age • Male gender **Modifiable:** • Hyperlipidemia (especially hypercholesterolemia, high LDL, low HDL) • Hypertension • Cigarette smoking • Diabetes mellitus • Inflammation • Hyperhomocysteinemia • Metabolic syndrome • Lipoprotein a [Lp(a)] | Follows the **"response to injury" hypothesis**, a chronic inflammatory and healing response: 1. **Endothelial injury/dysfunction:** Caused by hemodynamic factors, hyperlipidemia, smoking, etc. This increases permeability and leukocyte adhesion. Laminar flow activates atheroprotective genes like **KLF2**. 2. **Accumulation of lipoproteins:** Mainly LDL and its oxidized forms, in the vessel wall. 3. **Monocyte adhesion and migration:** Monocytes enter the intima and transform into macrophages and foam cells. 4. **Platelet adhesion.** 5. **Factor release:** From activated cells, inducing SMC recruitment. 6. **SMC proliferation & ECM production:** SMCs proliferate, produce ECM (collagen), and T cells are recruited. 7. **Lipid accumulation:** Both extracellularly and within cells (macrophages, SMCs). 8. **Inflammation:** Cholesterol crystals activate the **NLRP-3 inflammasome**, leading to **IL-1** production and a chronic inflammatory state. | • **Polygenic:** Most common, related to small effects of many shared alleles. • **Mendelian disorders:** Familial hypercholesterolemia (mutations in **LDL receptor gene**). • **Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP):** Age-related outgrowth of hematopoietic clones with mutations (e.g., in **TET2**) that can impact inflammation and increase cardiovascular mortality. | • **Fatty streaks:** Small, flat, yellow macules, do not disturb flow. • **Atherosclerotic plaque:** Raised, yellow-tan lesions that protrude into the lumen. Patchy and eccentric. Often have superimposed red-brown thrombus. Sites (descending order): lower abdominal aorta, coronary arteries, popliteal arteries, internal carotid arteries, circle of Willis. | Plaques have four principal components: 1. **Cells:** SMCs, macrophages, T lymphocytes. 2. **ECM:** Collagen, elastic fibers, proteoglycans. 3. **Lipids:** Intracellular and extracellular (cholesterol and esters), often seen as empty crystalline "clefts". 4. **Calcification.** **Structure:** A superficial **fibrous cap** (SMCs, dense collagen) over a central **necrotic core** (lipid, cell debris, foam cells). Periphery shows neovascularization. | Often asymptomatic for decades. Symptoms arise from: • **Atherosclerotic Stenosis:** Leads to chronic ischemia when >70% occluded (**critical stenosis**), causing stable angina, intermittent claudication, bowel ischemia. • **Acute Plaque Change:** Rupture, erosion, or hemorrhage, leading to thrombosis and acute tissue infarction (myocardial infarction, stroke). | **C-reactive protein (CRP)** is a strong, independent marker of risk. Elevated total cholesterol, LDL, and Lp(a) levels. | • **Stable plaques:** Thick fibrous cap, minimal inflammation, small lipid core. • **Vulnerable plaques:** Thin fibrous cap, dense inflammation, large lipid core. More prone to rupture. | Myocardial infarction (heart attack), cerebral infarction (stroke), aortic aneurysms, peripheral vascular disease (gangrene). | **Statins** (inhibit **HMG CoA reductase**), smoking cessation, diet, exercise. |
| **Aneurysm** A localized abnormal dilation of a blood vessel or the heart. | Two most important causes are **atherosclerosis** (major factor in AAAs) and **hypertension** (major factor in ascending aortic aneurysms). Other causes: trauma, vasculitis, congenital defects, infections (**mycotic aneurysms**). | Smoking, advanced age, male gender (for AAA). | Pathogenesis involves compromise of the vascular wall's connective tissue via: 1. **Poor intrinsic quality of connective tissue.** 2. **Altered balance of collagen degradation/synthesis:** Inflammation leads to increased protease (MMP) production by macrophages, degrading ECM. 3. **Loss of SMCs or inappropriate ECM synthesis:** Medial ischemia from severe atherosclerosis or hypertension (affecting vasa vasorum) weakens the wall. 4. **Abnormal TGF-β signaling.** | • **Marfan syndrome:** Defective synthesis of fibrillin (**FBN1 gene**) leads to abnormal TGF-β activity. • **Loeys-Dietz syndrome:** Mutations in **TGF-β receptors** or pathway components (e.g., **SMAD3**). • **Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome:** Defective type III collagen synthesis. | **Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA):** Usually located between renal arteries and aortic bifurcation. Can be saccular or fusiform. Severe complicated atherosclerosis with a poorly organized mural thrombus. **Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm:** Associated with hypertension. | **Cystic medial degeneration:** A nonspecific finding common to all forms. Shows elastic fiber fragmentation, loss of SMCs, and accumulation of amorphous proteoglycan-rich ECM. Elastin stain shows loss and fragmentation of elastic lamellae. | Often asymptomatic.  • **AAA:** May present as a palpably pulsating abdominal mass.  • **Thoracic:** May cause chest pain, difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, or respiratory issues due to compression. | - | • **True aneurysm:** Involves an attenuated but intact arterial wall. Can be **saccular** (spherical outpouching) or **fusiform** (diffuse, circumferential dilation). • **False aneurysm (pseudoaneurysm):** A wall defect leads to an extravascular hematoma communicating with the intravascular space. • Variants: Inflammatory AAA, IgG4-related disease, Mycotic AAA. | • **Rupture** with massive, potentially fatal hemorrhage. • **Obstruction** of a branch vessel causing downstream ischemia. • **Embolism** from atheroma or mural thrombus. • **Impingement** on an adjacent structure. | Surgical repair (open graft or endovascular stent graft) for aneurysms >5 cm or those that are symptomatic or rapidly expanding. |
| **Dissecting Aneurysm (Aortic Dissection)** Occurs when blood separates the laminar planes of the media to form a blood-filled channel within the aortic wall. | **Hypertension** is the major risk factor in >90% of cases. Also associated with inherited or acquired connective tissue disorders. Can be iatrogenic or related to pregnancy. | Men aged 40 to 60 with antecedent hypertension; younger patients with systemic conditions like Marfan syndrome. | The ultimate trigger for the initial intimal tear is usually unknown. Once the tear occurs, blood flow under systemic pressure dissects through the media, propagating the hematoma. | Associated with syndromic diseases affecting the aorta (e.g., Marfan syndrome). | The intimal tear is typically transverse or jagged, usually located in the ascending aorta within 10 cm of the aortic valve. The dissection creates a false channel within the media. Can rupture through the adventitia. A **"double-barreled aorta"** may form if the blood re-enters the lumen distally. | Medial degeneration (**cystic medial degeneration**) is often present but may be trivial or absent. Characterized by elastic fiber fragmentation and loss of SMCs. Inflammation is characteristically absent. | Sudden onset of **excruciating, tearing pain**, usually beginning in the anterior chest and radiating to the back between the scapulae, moving downward as the dissection progresses. Can be confused with myocardial infarction. | - | • **Type A (proximal):** More common and dangerous lesions involving the ascending aorta (DeBakey types I and II). • **Type B (distal):** Lesions not involving the ascending aorta, usually beginning distal to the subclavian artery (DeBakey type III). | Rupture into pericardial, pleural, or peritoneal cavities (cardiac tamponade, massive hemorrhage). Aortic insufficiency. Obstruction of branch arteries (coronary, carotid, renal), leading to MI, stroke, kidney failure. | **Type A:** Medical emergency requiring intensive antihypertensive therapy and surgical plication of the tear. **Type B:** Can often be managed conservatively with antihypertensive medication. |
| **Hypertensive vascular diseases** Vascular pathology resulting from sustained high blood pressure. | • **Essential hypertension (90-95%):** Idiopathic, resulting from interacting genetic and environmental factors. • **Secondary hypertension (5-10%):** Caused by underlying renal disease, adrenal disease, or other identifiable cause. | Stress, obesity, smoking, physical inactivity, heavy salt consumption, increasing age, family history. | Blood pressure is a function of cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance. The **Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System** is a key regulator. In essential hypertension, a key initiating event is thought to be insufficient renal sodium excretion, leading to increased fluid volume, cardiac output, and peripheral vasoconstriction. A new steady state is achieved at a higher blood pressure. | • **Essential hypertension:** Polygenic, with many loci contributing small effects. • **Single-gene disorders (rare):** Mutations in genes affecting aldosterone metabolism (e.g., aldosterone synthase) or sodium resorption (e.g., **Liddle syndrome**, a mutation in an epithelial Na+ channel protein). | - | Two main forms of small vessel disease: 1. **Hyaline arteriolosclerosis:** Arterioles show homogeneous, pink hyaline thickening and luminal narrowing. Reflects plasma protein leakage and increased SMC matrix synthesis. 2. **Hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis:** In severe hypertension. Concentric, laminated "**onion-skin**" thickening of walls. In malignant hypertension, associated with **fibrinoid necrosis** and **necrotizing arteriolitis**. | Usually asymptomatic until late in its course. **Malignant hypertension** is a specific syndrome with severe pressure elevation (>200/120 mm Hg), renal failure, retinal hemorrhages and exudates, with or without papilledema. | - | • **Essential (Idiopathic) vs. Secondary** • **Benign vs. Malignant** | Accelerates atherosclerosis, congestive heart failure, cardiac hypertrophy, multi-infarct dementia, aortic dissection, and renal failure. | Blood pressure-lowering drugs. |
| **Vasculitis** A general term for vessel wall inflammation. | Primarily immune-mediated inflammation or direct invasion of vascular walls by infectious pathogens. Can also be caused by physical or chemical injury. | - | Two pathogenic mechanisms: 1. **Immune-mediated inflammation:** Can be due to immune complex deposition, Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (ANCAs), anti-endothelial cell antibodies, or autoreactive T cells. 2. **Direct invasion by infectious pathogens:** e.g., bacteria or fungi. | - | - | Inflammatory cell infiltrates in vessel walls. | Typically includes constitutional signs and symptoms (fever, myalgias, arthralgias, malaise) plus manifestations related to the specific vascular bed affected. | **Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (ANCAs)** are useful diagnostic markers for certain types of vasculitis. | Classified based on: vessel size (large, medium, small), primary pathogenic mechanism, presence of specific autoantibodies, and organ specificity. | Organ dysfunction depending on the pattern of vascular involvement. | Immunosuppressive therapy for immune-mediated forms; antibiotics for infectious forms. |
| **Giant Cell (Temporal) Arteritis** A chronic, granulomatous inflammation of large- to small-sized arteries, principally affecting arteries in the head. The most common form of vasculitis in elderly adults. | Likely a T cell-mediated immune response to an as-yet-uncharacterized vessel wall antigen. | Age > 50 years. | A T cell-mediated immune response is central. Proinflammatory cytokines (especially **TNF**) and anti-EC antibodies also contribute. The response to steroids supports an immune etiology. | Association with certain **MHC class II haplotypes**. | Involved arterial segments (e.g., temporal artery) are nodular and thickened. | Classic lesions exhibit medial **granulomatous inflammation** centered on the internal elastic membrane with elastic lamina fragmentation. There is an infiltrate of T cells (CD4+ > CD8+) and macrophages. **Multinucleated giant cells** are seen in ~75% of cases. Intimal thickening reduces the lumen. Lesions can be focal, so a negative biopsy does not rule out disease. | May be vague and constitutional (fever, fatigue, weight loss) or involve facial pain or headache, most intense along the course of the temporal artery, which is painful to palpation. Ocular symptoms (diplopia to complete vision loss) appear abruptly in 50% of patients. | Diagnosis depends on biopsy of temporal artery (requires at least a 1-cm segment). | A form of large-vessel vasculitis. | Sudden and permanent blindness due to ophthalmic artery involvement. Aortitis. | Corticosteroids or anti-TNF therapies are typically effective. |
| **Takayasu Arteritis** A granulomatous vasculitis of medium and larger arteries (the "pulseless disease") characterized by ocular disturbances and marked weakening of the pulses in the upper extremities. | An autoimmune etiology is likely. | Typically affects patients younger than 50 years of age. | - | Associated with a subset of human leukocyte antigen haplotypes. | Irregular fibrous thickening of the aorta, particularly the aortic arch and great vessels, with severe luminal narrowing or obliteration of major branch vessels. | Histology is essentially indistinguishable from giant cell arteritis. Ranges from adventitial mononuclear infiltrates to intense mononuclear inflammation in the media with **granulomatous inflammation**, giant cells, and patchy medial necrosis. Progresses to collagenous scarring. | Initial symptoms are nonspecific (fatigue, weight loss, fever). Later, vascular symptoms dominate: reduced blood pressure and weaker pulses in upper extremities, ocular disturbances (visual defects, blindness), and neurologic deficits. Claudication of legs. | - | A form of large-vessel vasculitis. | Pulmonary hypertension, myocardial infarction (from coronary ostia narrowing), systemic hypertension (from renal artery involvement), aortic valve insufficiency. | - |
| **Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN)** A systemic vasculitis of small- or medium-sized muscular arteries that typically affects renal and visceral vessels but spares the pulmonary circulation. | Cause is unknown in the majority. About 30% of patients have chronic hepatitis B, suggesting immune complex deposition. | Primarily affects young adults but can occur in all age groups. | In hepatitis B positive cases, deposition of HBsAg-HBsAb immune complexes is the mechanism. | - | Segmental involvement of arteries, often with aneurysms and/or thrombosis. Leads to ulcerations, infarcts, ischemic atrophy, or hemorrhage in affected organs (kidney, heart, liver, GI tract). | Segmental transmural necrotizing inflammation of the arterial wall with a mixed infiltrate of neutrophils, eosinophils, and mononuclear cells. Often accompanied by **fibrinoid necrosis** and luminal thrombosis. Characteristically, **all stages of activity (early to late) coexist** in different vessels or within the same vessel. | Course is frequently remitting and episodic. Presentation is variable: rapidly accelerating hypertension (renal artery), abdominal pain and bloody stools (GI lesions), diffuse myalgias, and peripheral neuritis. | Not associated with ANCAs. HBsAg may be present. | A form of medium-vessel vasculitis. | Renal involvement is often a major cause of mortality. | Immunosuppression can yield remissions or cure in 90% of cases. Untreated, it is typically fatal. |
| **Kawasaki Disease** An acute, febrile, usually self-limited illness of infancy and childhood associated with large- to medium-sized vessel arteritis. Also called **mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome**. | Likely triggered by a variety of infectious agents (mostly viral) in genetically susceptible persons. | 80% of patients are younger than 4 years of age. | May result from a delayed-type hypersensitivity response directed against vascular antigens. Subsequent cytokine production and polyclonal B-cell activation result in autoantibodies to ECs and SMCs that precipitate the vasculitis. | Genetic susceptibility is implicated. | Coronary artery arteritis, ectasia, or giant aneurysms (7-8 mm). | Vasculitis resembles PAN, with a dense transmural inflammatory infiltrate. Fibrinoid necrosis is usually less prominent than in PAN. Healed lesions can show obstructive intimal thickening. | Presents with the criteria for **mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome**: conjunctival and oral erythema and blistering, edema of hands and feet, erythema of palms and soles, a desquamative rash, and cervical lymph node enlargement. | - | A form of medium-vessel vasculitis. | Cardiovascular sequelae develop in 20% of untreated patients, most importantly **coronary artery aneurysms** that can rupture or thrombose, causing myocardial infarction or sudden death. | Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and aspirin. |
| **Microscopic Polyangiitis** A necrotizing vasculitis that generally affects capillaries, small arterioles, and venules. Also called **hypersensitivity vasculitis** or **leukocytoclastic vasculitis**. | Antibody responses to antigens like drugs (penicillin), microorganisms (streptococci), or tumor proteins have been implicated. | - | Most cases are associated with MPO-ANCA. Recruitment and activation of neutrophils within affected vascular beds is likely responsible for the disease manifestations. Lesions tend to be of the same age, suggesting a single pathogenic event. | - | Macroscopic infarcts are uncommon because larger arteries are spared. | Characterized by segmental **fibrinoid necrosis** of the media with focal transmural necrotizing lesions; granulomatous inflammation is absent. Lesions morphologically resemble PAN. In some areas (typically postcapillary venules), only infiltrating and fragmenting neutrophils are seen, giving rise to the term **leukocytoclastic vasculitis**. Lesions are typically **pauci-immune** (little or no immunoglobulin seen). | Depends on vascular bed involved: hemoptysis (pulmonary capillaritis), hematuria and proteinuria (glomerulonephritis), bowel pain or bleeding, muscle pain, and palpable cutaneous purpura. | Most cases are associated with **MPO-ANCA** (p-ANCA). | A form of small-vessel vasculitis. | Necrotizing glomerulonephritis (90% of patients) and pulmonary capillaritis are particularly common. Associated with Henoch-Schönlein purpura, essential mixed cryoglobulinemia. | Immunosuppression induces remission and markedly improves long-term survival. |
| **Granulomatosis With Polyangiitis (GPA)** A necrotizing vasculitis (formerly Wegener granulomatosis) characterized by a triad of necrotizing granulomas of the respiratory tract, necrotizing vasculitis of small- to medium-sized vessels, and glomerulonephritis. | Likely represents a form of T cell-mediated hypersensitivity response to normally "innocuous" inhaled microbial or other environmental agents. | Males are affected more often than females, at an average age of 40 years. | T cell-mediated hypersensitivity is supported by presence of granulomas and response to therapy. PR3-ANCAs are present in up to 95% of cases and are thought to participate in pathogenesis. Rising titers are predictive of relapse. | - | Upper respiratory tract lesions: ulcerative lesions of the nose, palate, or pharynx. Lungs: radiographically visible nodules that can cavitate. | • **Respiratory tract:** Acute **necrotizing granulomas** with geographic patterns of central necrosis and accompanying vasculitis. Surrounded by proliferating fibroblasts, giant cells, and leukocyte infiltrate. • **Kidneys:** Lesions range from focal necrotizing glomerulonephritis to **crescentic glomerulonephritis**. | Classic features include bilateral pneumonitis with nodules and cavitary lesions (95%), chronic sinusitis (90%), mucosal ulcerations of the nasopharynx (75%), and renal disease (80%). Rashes, myalgias, neuritis can also occur. | **PR3-ANCAs** (c-ANCA) are present in up to 95% of cases and are a useful marker of disease activity. | A form of small-vessel vasculitis. Can have "limited" forms restricted to the respiratory tract or widespread forms affecting eyes, skin, heart. | Rapidly fatal if untreated. Respiratory involvement can lead to alveolar hemorrhage. Renal disease can progress to end-stage. | Treatment with steroids, cyclophosphamide, TNF antagonists, and anti-B-cell antibodies has turned GPA into a chronic relapsing and remitting disease. |
| **Churg-Strauss Syndrome** A small-vessel necrotizing vasculitis also called **allergic granulomatosis and angiitis**, classically associated with asthma and eosinophilia. | Likely a consequence of hyperresponsiveness to some normally innocuous allergic stimulus. | - | - | - | Lung infiltrates. | Vascular lesions differ from PAN or microscopic polyangiitis by the presence of both **granulomas** and a striking **eosinophilic infiltration** of vessels and tissues. | Associated with asthma, allergic rhinitis, lung infiltrates, peripheral eosinophilia. Cutaneous involvement (palpable purpura), gastrointestinal bleeding, and renal disease are major associations. | **MPO-ANCAs** are present in a minority of cases. | A form of small-vessel vasculitis. | Cardiomyopathy due to myocardial eosinophilic infiltrates occurs in 60% of patients and is a major cause of morbidity and death. | - |
| **Thromboangiitis Obliterans (Buerger Disease)** Characterized by segmental, thrombosing, acute and chronic inflammation of medium- and small-sized arteries, especially the tibial and radial arteries, leading to vascular insufficiency. | Strong relationship with heavy cigarette smoking. May be a direct EC toxicity from a tobacco component or an immune response to tobacco-modified host proteins. | Occurs almost exclusively in heavy cigarette smokers, usually before the age of 35. | Patients have hypersensitivity to intradermally injected tobacco extracts and exhibit impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation. | Association with certain MHC haplotypes. | - | Acute and chronic inflammation accompanied by luminal thrombosis. The thrombus can contain small **microabscesses** (neutrophils surrounded by granulomatous inflammation). The inflammatory process extends into contiguous veins and nerves. | Early manifestations include **Raynaud phenomenon**, instep foot pain induced by exercise (instep claudication), and superficial nodular phlebitis. Severe pain, even at rest, is common due to neural involvement. | - | A form of medium-vessel vasculitis. | Chronic extremity ulcerations can develop, progressing to frank gangrene. | Smoking abstinence in the early stages can ameliorate further attacks. |
| **Infectious Vasculitis** Arteritis caused by the direct invasion of infectious agents. | Usually bacteria or fungi, in particular **Aspergillus** and **Mucor** species. | - | Vascular invasion can be part of a localized tissue infection (e.g., pneumonia), or arise from hematogenous spread during septicemia or embolization from infective endocarditis. | - | - | - | - | - | - | Can weaken arterial walls and culminate in **mycotic aneurysms**, or induce thrombosis and downstream infarction (e.g., of the brain in bacterial meningitis). | - |
| **Hemangioma** Very common benign tumors composed of blood-filled vessels. Constitute 7% of all benign tumors of infancy and childhood. | - | Most are present from birth. | - | - | Typically confined to head, neck, and skin. Can occur internally (e.g., liver). **Pyogenic granulomas** are rapidly growing red pedunculated lesions on skin or mucosa. | • **Capillary hemangioma:** Composed of thin-walled capillaries with scant stroma. • **Cavernous hemangioma:** Composed of large, dilated vascular channels. More infiltrative and frequently involve deep structures. • They contain obvious vascular channels lined by a monolayer of normal-appearing ECs. | Usually of little clinical significance outside of cosmetic issues or vulnerability to ulceration/bleeding. **Juvenile hemangiomas** grow rapidly then fade and regress. | - | • **Capillary hemangioma** (most common type) • **Juvenile (strawberry-type) hemangioma** • **Cavernous hemangioma** • **Pyogenic granuloma** | Malignant transformation is rare. Brain hemangiomas can cause symptoms from compression or rupture. Associated with **von Hippel-Lindau disease**. | Many regress spontaneously. Pyogenic granulomas are treated with curettage and cautery. |
| **Lymphangioma** Benign lymphatic counterparts of hemangiomas. | - | - | - | - | • **Simple:** Slightly elevated lesions on head, neck, axilla. • **Cavernous:** Can be enormous, found in neck or axilla of children, causing deformities. | • **Simple (capillary):** Networks of endothelium-lined spaces without erythrocytes. • **Cavernous (cystic hygroma):** Massively dilated lymphatic spaces lined by ECs, separated by connective tissue stroma with lymphoid aggregates. Indistinct margins. • Identification: Differentiated from blood vessels by absence of red cells and use of lymphatic endothelial markers (e.g., **VEGFR-3, LYVE-1**). | - | - | • **Simple (capillary) lymphangioma** • **Cavernous lymphangioma (cystic hygroma)** | Cavernous lymphangiomas of the neck are common in **Turner syndrome**. Their indistinct margins make resection difficult. | - |
| **Kaposi sarcoma (KS)** A vascular neoplasm caused by human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8). It is an intermediate-grade (borderline) tumor. | Caused by **human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8)** infection, in the context of altered T-cell immunity. | Depends on the form. AIDS, solid-organ transplant (immunosuppression), older men of Mediterranean/Eastern European descent. | HHV8 causes both lytic and latent infections in ECs. • A virally encoded G protein induces **VEGF** production, stimulating endothelial growth. • Cytokines from inflammatory cells create a local proliferative milieu. • In latently infected cells, HHV8 proteins disrupt cell cycle controls (e.g., viral homologue of cyclin D) and prevent apoptosis (by inhibiting p53). Progresses through three stages: patch, plaque, and nodule. | Somatic mutations in the cells of origin also contribute to tumor progression. | Lesions progress from red-purple macules (**patches**) to larger, violaceous, raised **plaques**, and finally to more distinctly neoplastic **nodules**. | • **Patch stage:** Dilated, irregular vascular spaces with interspersed lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages. • **Plaque stage:** Dermal accumulations of dilated, jagged vascular channels lined by plump spindle cells. • **Nodular stage:** Sheets of plump, proliferating spindle cells, containing small vessels and slitlike spaces with red cells. Marked hemorrhage and hemosiderin are present. Mitotic figures are common. | Course varies widely. Classic KS is often asymptomatic and localized to skin. AIDS-associated KS is aggressive, involves lymph nodes, and disseminates widely to viscera. | - | Four forms: 1. **Classic KS:** Older men, indolent course. 2. **Endemic African KS:** Can be aggressive, often involves lymph nodes. 3. **Transplant-associated KS:** Aggressive course, can regress with reduced immunosuppression. 4. **AIDS-associated (epidemic) KS:** An AIDS-defining illness, aggressive. | AIDS-associated KS is an AIDS-defining illness. Patients often die of opportunistic infections rather than KS itself. | Varies by type. Surgical resection, radiation. For AIDS-associated KS, HIV antiretroviral therapy is beneficial. For transplant-associated KS, withdrawal of immunosuppression is often effective. |
| **Hemangioendothelioma** A spectrum of borderline vascular neoplasms with clinical behaviors intermediate between benign hemangiomas and frankly anaplastic angiosarcomas. | - | Occurs in adults, around medium- and large-sized veins. | - | - | - | **Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma** is a type where well-defined vascular channels are inconspicuous, and neoplastic cells are plump and often cuboidal (resembling epithelial cells). | Clinical behavior is extremely variable. | - | - | Up to 40% recur, 20% to 30% eventually metastasize, and 15% of patients will die of their tumor. | Most are cured by excision. |
