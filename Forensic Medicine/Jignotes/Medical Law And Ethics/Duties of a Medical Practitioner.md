# [[Medical Law And Ethics]] > Duties of a Medical Practitioner

### **Duties of a Medical Practitioner**

The duties of a registered medical practitioner (RMP) are governed by the codes of [[Medical Ethics]], acts of the state, and the laws of the land. These duties are broadly classified into obligations towards the patient, the state/community, and the profession.

### **I. Duties Towards the Patient**

Once a doctor agrees to attend to a patient, a **Doctor-Patient Relationship** is established, creating a contractual obligation.

**1. Duty to Exercise Reasonable Skill and Care**
*   **Standard of Care:** A doctor is expected to bring a reasonable degree of skill and knowledge and must exercise a reasonable degree of care. He is not expected to possess the highest degree of skill (like a specialist) if he is a general practitioner, nor is he liable for not possessing the lowest.
*   **Duration:** Once a case is undertaken, the doctor must attend to the patient as long as the illness requires or until the patient is cured, dies, or discharges the doctor.
*   **Withdrawal:** A doctor can withdraw from a case only after giving **reasonable notice** to allow the patient to find another physician.

**2. Duty to Furnish Proper Medicines and Instructions**
*   Prescriptions must be **legible** and preferably written in capital letters.
*   Full instructions regarding diet, dosage, timing, and route of administration must be given.
*   **Warning of Risks:** The doctor has a duty to warn the patient about potential side effects (e.g., drowsiness from antihistamines affecting driving).

**3. Duty regarding Consent**
*   **Mandatory:** No diagnostic or therapeutic procedure should be done without [[Informed Consent]].
*   **Exceptions:** Life-threatening emergencies (Sec 92 IPC) where the patient is unconscious and no guardian is available (Doctrine of Necessity/Implied Consent).
*   **Explanation:** The nature, risks, benefits, and alternatives of the treatment must be explained in simple language.

**4. Duty of Professional Secrecy (Confidentiality)**
*   The doctor must keep secret all information acquired during professional practice.
*   **Breach:** Divulging secrets without consent is a breach of trust and can lead to a lawsuit for damages unless it falls under **Privileged Communication**.

**5. Duty in Emergency Cases**
*   It is a humanitarian and ethical duty to render first-aid and save the life of a patient in an emergency, regardless of the specialty or whether it is a medicolegal case.
*   Under **Art. 21 of the Constitution of India** (Right to Life), supreme courts have mandated that preservation of life is of paramount importance.

**6. Duty regarding Consultation**
*   A doctor should suggest consultation with a specialist in difficult/obscure cases, or if the patient desires it.

**7. Maintenance of Medical Records**
*   Records of indoor patients must be maintained for **3 years**.
*   Requests for records by the patient/authorities must be honored within **72 hours**.

### **II. Duties Towards the State and Public**

These are statutory duties required by law to protect the community.

**1. Notification of Diseases**
*   The doctor is legally bound to inform public health authorities about **Notifiable Diseases** (e.g., Cholera, Plague, Smallpox, Polio, [[HIV]], Tuberculosis).
*   Failure to report can lead to legal penalties.

**2. Notification of Births and Deaths**
*   It is a statutory duty to notify births and deaths to the municipal authorities.
*   **Death Certificate:** A doctor must issue a death certificate free of charge if they attended the patient during the last illness.
    *   *Note:* Do not issue a certificate if the cause of death is unknown or if foul play is suspected (Refer to police).

**3. Reporting Suspected Crime**
*   **Section 39 CrPC:** Every person (including doctors) aware of the commission of serious offenses (e.g., murder, dacoity) is bound to inform the police.
*   **Section 40 CrPC:** Village officers must report unnatural deaths.

**4. Duties in Poisoning Cases**
*   **Preservation:** Collect and preserve vomit, excreta, and stomach wash in suspected poisoning cases.
*   **Reporting:**
    *   **Govt. Doctor:** Must report *all* cases (accidental, suicidal, homicidal).
    *   **Private Doctor:** Legally bound to report **Homicidal** poisoning (S. 39 CrPC). Suicidal poisoning reporting is not explicitly mandatory under S. 39 but is ethical and often required by local laws.

### **III. Duties Towards the Profession (Medical Etiquette)**

*   **Respect:** A doctor should consider colleagues as brothers/sisters and not criticize them in front of patients.
*   **No Enticement:** A doctor should not entice patients away from colleagues.
*   **Gratuitous Service:** It is a pleasure and privilege to render free service to other physicians and their immediate dependents.

### **Privileged Communication**

This is an exception to Professional Secrecy. It is a statement made by a doctor to a concerned authority to protect the interest of the community or state.

**Examples where secrecy can be broken:**
1.  **Infectious Diseases:** A cook/waiter having typhoid; a bus driver having epilepsy.
2.  **Venereal Diseases:** To protect a future spouse (moral duty).
3.  **Suspected Crime:** Informing police about a gunshot wound or homicidal poisoning.
4.  **Courts of Law:** Doctors cannot claim privilege in witness box; they must answer questions asked by the judge.
5.  **Patient's Own Interest:** Warning parents of a suicidal minor.

    *   **D**ereliction (Breach of duty).
    *   **D**irect Causation (Breach caused damage).
