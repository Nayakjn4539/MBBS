### Post-Mortem Examination in Poisoning

The medicolegal autopsy in a suspected case of poisoning involves a meticulous search for diagnostic clues, ranging from the odor of the body to specific pathological changes in organs. It follows the standard autopsy protocol but requires specific modifications to preserve volatile evidences.

#### Objectives of Autopsy in Poisoning
1.  Confirm the cause of death.
2.  Identify the specific [[Poison/Toxin]].
3.  Determine the manner of death (Suicidal, Homicidal, or Accidental).
4.  Collect relevant samples for [[Chemical Analysis]] to serve as evidentiary proof.

### I. External Examination

A thorough inspection of the clothing and body surface provides vital initial clues.

**1. Clothes and Surroundings**
*   **Stains:** Look for stains of vomit, feces, or the poison itself on clothes or skin.
*   **Corrosion:** Acids/alkalis cause destruction and discoloration of clothes.
    *   **Nitric acid:** Yellowish stains.
    *   **Sulfuric acid:** Black/Charred stains.
*   **Smell:** Note any peculiar odor on the clothes.

**2. Postmortem Staining (Hypostasis)**
The color of [[Postmortem Lividity]] can be diagnostic for certain poisons,,.

| Color of Hypostasis | Suspected Poison |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cherry Red** | [[Carbon Monoxide]] (Carboxyhemoglobin) |
| **Bright Red / Brick Red** | [[Cyanide]] (Cyanmethemoglobin), Cold exposure |
| **Chocolate / Brown** | Nitrites, Aniline, Potassium Chlorate, Nitrobenzene (Methemoglobinemia) |
| **Dark Brown / Yellow** | Phosphorus, Copper |
| **Blue-Green** | [[Hydrogen Sulfide]] (Sulfmethemoglobin) |
| **Deep Blue** | Asphyxiants (CO2) |

**3. Smell / Odor**
Perceived near the mouth and nose.

| Odor | Suspected Poison |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Bitter Almonds** | [[Cyanide]] |
| **Garlic** | Phosphorus, [[Arsenic]], [[Organophosphorus Compounds]], Aluminum Phosphide |
| **Burnt Rope** | [[Cannabis]] |
| **Kerosene / Petrol** | Kerosene, Organophosphates (due to aromax solvent) |
| **Fruity / Sweet** | [[Ethanol]], Chloroform, Diabetic Ketoacidosis |
| **Rotten Eggs** | Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S), Mercaptans |
| **Shoe Polish** | Nitrobenzene |
| **Acrid / Pungent** | Chloral hydrate, Paraldehyde |
| **Fishy / Musty** | Zinc Phosphide |

> **Mnemonic for Smells:**
> **C**yanide is **B**itter (Almonds)
> **P**hosphorus is **G**arlic
> **A**lcohol is **F**ruity
> **H**ydrogen Sulfide is **R**otten (Eggs)

**4. Natural Orifices**
*   **Mouth:** Look for corrosion, whitening (phenols), or chalky white teeth (sulfuric acid).
*   **Froth:** Presence of froth at mouth/nose indicates pulmonary edema (common in [[Opioids]] and [[Organophosphorus Compounds]]),.

**5. Skin Findings**
*   **Injection Marks:** Especially in drug addicts. Look at antecubital fossae, webs of fingers, or concealed areas (under tongue, scrotum). Examine for inflammation, abscesses, or track marks ("Turkey skin"),.
*   **Color Changes:** Jaundice (Yellow) in Phosphorus or delayed arsenic poisoning.
*   **Blisters/Bullae:** Seen in [[Barbiturate]] poisoning and Carbon Monoxide poisoning,.
*   **Hyperkeratosis:** Thickening of palms/soles in chronic [[Arsenic]] poisoning.

### II. Internal Examination

**Important Rule:** The **Cranial Cavity** should be opened **FIRST**,.
*   **Reason:** Faint odors (like cyanide or alcohol) concentrated in the brain may be masked by the strong smell of decomposition or fecal matter once the abdominal cavity is opened.

**1. Gastrointestinal Tract (GIT)**
*   **Mouth/Throat:** Inspect for corrosion, bleaching, or staining of mucosa.
*   **Esophagus:** Corrosive alkalis produce marked softening and desquamation (soap-like eschar).
*   **Stomach:**
    *   **Incision:** Opened along the greater curvature. > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Illustration of stomach incision along greater curvature
    *   **Contents:** Note volume, color, consistency, and smell. Look for tablets, capsules, leaves, or crystals.
    *   **Mucosa:**
        *   **Hyperemia/Redness:** Simple irritants.
        *   **Velvety Red:** [[Arsenic]].
        *   **Leathery Hard/White:** [[Formaldehyde]] (Formalin).
        *   **Wet Blotting Paper:** [[Sulfuric Acid]].
        *   **Black/Charred:** Concentrated acids.
    *   **Perforation:** May be seen with strong acids (Sulfuric acid).

**2. Lungs**
*   Usually congested and edematous.
*   **Opiates:** Gross pulmonary edema; lungs are voluminous and heavy.
*   **Hydrocarbons:** Chemical pneumonitis.
*   **Paraquat:** Fibrosis (in delayed deaths).

**3. Heart**
*   **Subendocardial Hemorrhages:** Flame-shaped hemorrhages in the left ventricle are characteristic (but not pathognomonic) of acute [[Arsenic]] poisoning,.
*   **Myocarditis/Necrosis:** Seen in Phosphorus and Aluminum phosphide poisoning.

**4. Liver and Kidneys**
*   **Liver:** Fatty degeneration or acute yellow atrophy in Phosphorus, Arsenic, and Alcohol poisoning,.
*   **Kidneys:** Acute tubular necrosis (Mercury, Oxalic acid). Oxalate crystals may be seen in tubules in Ethylene glycol poisoning,.

**5. Brain**
*   Congestion and edema are common nonspecific findings.
*   **Basal Ganglia Necrosis:** Bilateral symmetrical necrosis of globus pallidus is seen in delayed [[Carbon Monoxide]] deaths.
*   **Hemorrhagic Encephalitis:** Seen in Arsenic and heavy metal poisoning.

### III. Preservation of Viscera (The Viscera Box)

In all cases of suspected poisoning, routine viscera must be preserved for [[Chemical Analysis]] at the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL).

#### A. Routine Viscera
The following must be preserved in **ALL** cases:

| Organ | Quantity to Preserve | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stomach** | Entire stomach + Contents | Identify unabsorbed poison; high concentration. |
| **Small Intestine** | Proximal 30 cm + Contents | Site of absorption. |
| **Liver** | 500 gm (or whole in children) | Major site of metabolism and concentration. |
| **Kidney** | Half of each kidney (longitudinally) | Main organ of excretion. |
| **Blood** | 10–30 ml (Peripheral vein) | Quantitative analysis; confirms circulation. |
| **Urine** | 30–50 ml (or available quantity) | Excretion product; screening. |

#### B. Special Viscera (Additional Samples)
Preserved based on specific suspicion:

*   **Brain (Half/500g):** Volatile organic poisons, alkaloids, neurotoxic drugs, anesthetics.
*   **Spinal Cord:** [[Strychnine]] poisoning.
*   **Lungs:** Gaseous poisons (CO, Cyanide), solvents, hydrocyanic acid (preserved in nylon bag).
*   **Bone (Femur shaft) & Nails/Hair:** Chronic heavy metal poisoning (Arsenic, Lead, Antimony, Thallium).
*   **Skin:** Excision of injection site with subcutaneous tissue (Drug abuse, Insulin).
*   **Vitreous Humor:** Alcohol estimation (resistant to putrefaction).
*   **Fat:** Organochlorine pesticides, anesthetic agents.

### IV. Preservatives

The choice of preservative is critical to prevent degradation of the sample or chemical interference.

| Preservative | Indication | Contraindications |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Saturated Saline (NaCl)** | **Standard preservative** for routine viscera. | Poisoning by **Corrosive Acids/Alkalis** (alters pH), **Aconite** (alkaloid hydrolysis). |
| **Rectified Spirit (90-95% Ethanol)** | Ideal for most organic poisons. | **P.P.O.C.A:** <br>• **P**hosphorus (glow lost)<br>• **P**araldehyde<br>• **O**rganophosphates (sometimes)<br>• **C**hloral hydrate<br>• **A**lcohol/Acetic acid/Phenol. |
| **Sodium Fluoride + Potassium Oxalate** | Blood samples (for Alcohol and Glucose). | None specific. Fluoride prevents glycolysis and bacterial production of alcohol. |
| **No Preservative** | Bone, Hair, Nails. | - |

> **Sample of Preservative:** An additional bottle containing *only* the preservative used (Control Sample) must be sent to rule out contamination.

### V. Medico-Legal Aspects & Chain of Custody

1.  **Labeling:** All bottles must be labeled with the name of deceased, type of organ, P.M. number, date, police station, and doctor's signature.
2.  **Sealing:** Bottles must be sealed with a unique seal (departmental seal).
3.  **Chain of Custody:** The sealed box, along with a copy of the seal impression, P.M. report, and inquest report, is handed over to the police constable. A receipt must be obtained to maintain the [[Chain of Custody]],.
4.  **Negative Autopsy:** In 2-5% of cases, no cause of death is found even after toxicological analysis. This is termed a **Negative Autopsy**. Common in poisons that are rapidly metabolized (e.g., Insulin), gases, or plant poisons.
