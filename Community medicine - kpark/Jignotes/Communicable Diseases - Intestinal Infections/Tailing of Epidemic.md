### **Tailing of Epidemic**

**Definition**
[[Tailing of Epidemic]] refers to the phenomenon where an epidemic curve does not fall sharply or end abruptly after the peak or after the removal of the primary source of infection. Instead, the number of cases declines gradually over a longer period, creating a "tail" on the graph.

**Mechanism and Causes**
The "tail" represents the continuation of disease transmission even after the primary cause (e.g., contaminated water) has been controlled. This occurs due to:
1.  **Secondary Waves (Contact Transmission):** The infection spreads from the primary cases (who got infected by the common source) to susceptible individuals via **person-to-person contact** (secondary cases),.
2.  **Force of Infection:** The total force of infection in an epidemic has two components:
    *   Force of infection through the **primary vehicle** (e.g., water).
    *   Force of infection through **contacts** (which creates the tail).
3.  **Propagated Spread:** In propagated epidemics (pure person-to-person transmission like measles), the epidemic naturally shows a gradual rise and **tails off** gradually as the number of susceptible hosts is depleted (herd immunity increases).

**Classic Example: [[Cholera]]**
*   **Scenario:** Water-borne cholera often starts as a **common-source epidemic** (contaminated water supply).
*   **The Curve:** It reaches a sharp peak quickly.
*   **The Tail:** Even after the contaminated water source is eliminated (e.g., by chlorination or closing the source), the outbreak does not end immediately. A "tail" is produced due to the continuation of transmission through **direct contact** (fecal-oral route via fingers/food/fomites) within the community,.

**Epidemiological Curve Characteristics**
*   **Point Source Epidemic:** Typically shows a sharp rise and a sharp fall. If a "tail" is observed here, it suggests **secondary transmission** is occurring.
*   **Propagated Epidemic:** Characterized by a gradual rise and a long, drawn-out **tail off**.

**Clinical Relevance**
*   **Control Measures:** Recognizing the "tail" is crucial for public health officers. It indicates that merely fixing the environmental source (like a well or pump) is insufficient. Strict personal hygiene, isolation of cases, and disinfection of excreta are required to stop the contact transmission causing the tail.
*   **Misinterpretation:** A tail might be mistaken for the persistence of the original source if secondary transmission is not considered.

**Mnemonic**
To remember why the curve has a tail:
**TAIL** = **T**ransmission **A**fter **I**nitial **L**oad ( Secondary Spread)
