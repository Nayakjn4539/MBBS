# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Chemotherapy of Multi-bacillary Leprosy

### Chemotherapy of Multi-bacillary (MB) Leprosy

**Multi-bacillary (MB) Leprosy** is operationally defined under the [[National Leprosy Eradication Programme]] (NLEP) as a case having **$\ge$ 6 skin lesions** OR involvement of **> 1 nerve** OR a positive skin smear (Bacteriological Index $\ge$ 2),,,.

The standard treatment is **Multi-Drug Therapy (MDT)**, which is essential to prevent drug resistance and interrupt transmission,.

---

### 1. Goals of MDT
*   **Interrupt Transmission:** Render the patient non-infectious rapidly.
*   **Cure:** Eliminate the [[Mycobacterium leprae]] bacilli from the body.
*   **Prevent Resistance:** Prevent the emergence of drug-resistant strains (dapsone resistance was a major issue with monotherapy).

### 2. Standard WHO/NLEP Regimen for Adults
For adults (body weight usually > 45 kg or age > 15 years), the regimen consists of three drugs: **Rifampicin**, **Clofazimine**, and **Dapsone**,,.

| Drug | Dosage | Frequency | Administration Mode |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Rifampicin]]** | 600 mg | Once Monthly | **Supervised** (taken in front of health worker) |
| **[[Clofazimine]]** | 300 mg | Once Monthly | **Supervised** |
| | 50 mg | Daily | **Self-administered** |
| **[[Dapsone]]** | 100 mg | Daily | **Self-administered** |

*   **Duration of Treatment:** **12 months** (12 monthly pulses completed within 18 months),,.
*   **Blister Packs:** Drugs are supplied in color-coded blister packs (MB packs are usually **Red** or distinct from PB packs) to ensure compliance,.

### 3. Regimen for Children (10–14 Years)
Doses are adjusted for children in this age group (or weight < 40 kg),,.

| Drug | Dosage | Frequency | Administration Mode |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rifampicin** | 450 mg | Once Monthly | **Supervised** |
| **Clofazimine** | 150 mg | Once Monthly | **Supervised** |
| | 50 mg | **Alternate Days** | **Self-administered** |
| **Dapsone** | 50 mg | Daily | **Self-administered** |

*   **Note:** For children < 10 years, doses are appropriately reduced further (e.g., Rifampicin 10 mg/kg, Clofazimine 1 mg/kg, Dapsone 2 mg/kg),.

### 4. Mechanism and Role of Drugs

1.  **[[Rifampicin]]:**
    *   Highly bactericidal; kills 99.9% of viable organisms within a few days.
    *   **Clinical Relevance:** Causes reddish discoloration of urine/sweat (inform patient to avoid panic).
    *   **Side Effects:** Hepatotoxicity, flu-like syndrome, thrombocytopenia.

2.  **[[Clofazimine]]:**
    *   Bacteriostatic and anti-inflammatory.
    *   **Clinical Relevance:** Useful in suppressing **Lepra Reactions** (ENL). Causes brownish-black/red skin discoloration and dry skin (ichthyosis),.
    *   If totally unacceptable to the patient due to discoloration, it may be replaced by **Ethionamide** or **Prothionamide** (250-375 mg daily),.

3.  **[[Dapsone]]:**
    *   Bacteriostatic; cheap and effective.
    *   **Clinical Relevance:** Watch for **Hemolytic anemia** and **G6PD deficiency**.
    *   **Adverse Effect:** [[DDS Syndrome]] (fever, exfolliative dermatitis, lymphadenopathy, hepatitis).

---

### 5. Follow-up and Surveillance
After completing the 12-month course, the patient is released from treatment (RFT).
*   **Surveillance Period:** **5 years**,,.
*   **Frequency:** Clinical examination once a year,.
*   **Purpose:** To detect **Relapse** or late **Reactions**.

---

### 6. Alternative Regimens (Drug Resistance/Toxicity)
If standard MDT cannot be used (e.g., Rifampicin resistance or toxicity), newer drugs are employed:
*   **Ofloxacin:** 400 mg daily.
*   **Minocycline:** 100 mg daily.
*   **Clarithromycin:** 500 mg daily.
*   **Regimen for Rifampicin Resistance:** Ofloxacin + Minocycline + Clofazimine for 6 months, followed by Ofloxacin + Clofazimine for 18 months (Total 24 months).

---

### 7. Clinical Relevance: Lepra Reactions
Patients often develop immune-mediated inflammatory episodes called **Lepra Reactions** during or after treatment.
*   **Action:** **DO NOT STOP MDT** during reactions. Continue chemotherapy along with anti-reaction measures (Steroids/Analgesics).
*   **Recurrence:** If a patient returns with signs of reaction/relapse, differentiate carefully. Relapse usually occurs >3 years after stopping treatment, whereas reversal reactions occur during or shortly after treatment.

### Mnemonic for MDT Drugs
**"R-C-D"**
*   **R** - **R**ed urine (**R**ifampicin) - **R**apid killer (Bactericidal).
*   **C** - **C**olored skin (**C**lofazimine) - **C**alms reactions (Anti-inflammatory).
*   **D** - **D**aily use (**D**apsone) - **D**ermatitis (Side effect).
