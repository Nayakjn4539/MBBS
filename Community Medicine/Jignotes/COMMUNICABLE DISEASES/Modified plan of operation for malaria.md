# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Modified plan of operation for malaria

# [[Modified Plan of Operation]] (MPO) for Malaria (1977)

**Background:**
Following the resurgence of malaria in the early 1970s (due to technical, administrative, and operational failures of the National Malaria Eradication Programme), the Government of India launched the **[[Modified Plan of Operation]] (MPO)** in **1977**,.
*   **Key Shift:** It marked a shift in philosophy from **"Eradication"** to **"Control"**.
*   **Approach:** It replaced the vertical program approach with a **horizontal approach** involving the general health services.

### 1. Objectives of MPO
The specific objectives set out under MPO were:
1.  **Prevention of deaths** due to malaria.
2.  **Reduction of morbidity** (sickness) due to malaria.
3.  **Maintenance** of the gains achieved so far.
4.  **Maintenance** of agricultural and industrial production (by keeping the workforce healthy).

### 2. Strategy: Stratification based on [[Annual Parasite Incidence]] (API)
The core strategy of MPO was the **stratification** of rural areas based on the disease burden, measured by the **[[Annual Parasite Incidence]] (API)**.

| Feature | **Areas with API $\ge$ 2** (High Risk) | **Areas with API < 2** (Low Risk) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vector Control** | **Regular Insecticide Spray:** Every 6 weeks during transmission season. | **Focal Spray:** Only done around a positive case of *P. falciparum* or during outbreaks. |
| **Surveillance** | Active and Passive surveillance. | Active and Passive surveillance. |
| **Treatment** | Radical treatment for positive cases. | Presumptive treatment for all fever cases; Radical treatment for positives. |
| **Lab Services** | Decentralization of laboratory services to the [[Primary Health Centre]] (PHC) level. | Epidemiological investigation of cases to determine source. |
| **Special Focus** | **[[Plasmodium falciparum Containment Programme]] (PfCP):** Intensive efforts in these areas with SIDA assistance. | Monitoring to prevent resurgence. |

### 3. Insecticide Spray Policy (Under MPO)
The choice of insecticide for indoor residual spraying (IRS) in **API $\ge$ 2 areas** was determined by the vector's susceptibility status.

*   **Non-refractory to [[DDT]]** $\rightarrow$ **DDT** (1.0 g/$m^2$); 2 rounds.
*   **Refractory to DDT** $\rightarrow$ **[[Malathion]]** (2.0 g/$m^2$); 3 rounds.
*   **Refractory to Malathion** $\rightarrow$ **Synthetic Pyrethroids** (0.25 g/$m^2$); 2 rounds.

### 4. Community Participation (Drug Distribution)
To ensure prompt treatment and prevent deaths, drug distribution was decentralized to the village level:

*   **[[Drug Distribution Centres]] (DDCs):**
    *   Run by community volunteers (e.g., teachers, postmasters).
    *   **Function:** Distribution of presumptive treatment (Chloroquine) to fever cases. No slide collection.
*   **[[Fever Treatment Depots]] (FTDs):**
    *   Run by community volunteers trained by the PHC.
    *   **Function:** Collection of **blood smears** (slides) AND administration of presumptive treatment.

### 5. Urban Malaria Scheme (UMS)
While MPO focused largely on rural stratification, the **[[Urban Malaria Scheme]]** (launched in 1971) continued to operate in towns/cities.
*   **Vector:** *[[Anopheles stephensi]]*.
*   **Strategy:** Recurrent **anti-larval measures** (chemical/biological) rather than anti-adult spraying,.

### **Mnemonic for MPO Objectives**

Remember **"M-P-O"** for the goals:
*   **M** - **M**aintain gains & Industrial/Agricultural production.
*   **P** - **P**revent Deaths.
*   **O** - **O**rganize reduction of Morbidity.

---

### **Clinical Relevance**
*   **API Significance:** In community medicine, calculating the [[Annual Parasite Incidence]] (API) is the "Gold Standard" for deciding intervention strategies. An API > 2 indicates high transmission requiring aggressive vector control (IRS).
*   **Drug Resistance:** The MPO acknowledged resistance; if a patient does not respond to Chloroquine (common in *P. falciparum* areas identified under PfCP), alternative drugs (Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine or ACTs in modern protocols) must be used.
