# [[Legal Procedures]] > The Witness

### **THE WITNESS**

A **Witness** is a person who gives evidence regarding facts or opinions in a [[Court of Law]]. According to **Section 118 of the Indian Evidence Act (IEA)**, all persons are competent to testify unless the Court considers that they are prevented from understanding the questions put to them, or from giving rational answers to those questions, due to tender years, extreme old age, disease (body or mind), or any other cause.

### **Types of Witnesses**

There are generally classified into the following categories:

#### **1. Common Witness (Ordinary / Lay / Fact Witness)**
*   **Definition:** A person who gives evidence about facts observed or perceived by them through their own senses (seen, heard, perceived).
*   **Principle:** They follow the **"First-hand knowledge rule"**. They must testify to what they actually saw or heard, not what they heard from others (Hearsay).
*   **Role:** To establish the facts of the case.
*   **Example:** A bystander who saw a traffic accident or a person who saw A hitting B with a stick.
*   **Limitation:** They **cannot** give an opinion.

#### **2. Expert Witness (Skilled Witness)**
*   **Definition:** A person trained, skilled, or educated in a technical or scientific subject (Medicine, Ballistics, Fingerprints, etc.) who can draw inferences/conclusions from facts observed by themselves or others. defined under **Section 45 IEA**.
*   **Role:** To help the Court form an opinion on matters of science/art where the Court lacks technical knowledge.
*   **Scope:** Can give evidence on:
    *   Facts (e.g., size of the wound).
    *   **Opinions** (e.g., the weapon that caused the wound).
    *   Hypothetical questions based on stated assumptions.
*   **Example:** A forensic pathologist giving an opinion on the [[Cause of Death]], a handwriting expert, a chemical examiner.

#### **3. Professional Witness**
*   **Definition:** A medical practitioner who testifies to facts that they observed/examined in their professional capacity while treating a patient.
*   **Nuance:** They are essentially "witnesses of fact" but with special professional knowledge.
*   **Example:** A casualty doctor describing the dimensions of a stab wound they sutured or reporting an X-ray finding.
*   *Note:* When the same doctor starts giving an opinion on *how* the injury was caused or the *time since death*, they become an Expert Witness. A doctor can be **both** a common/professional witness and an expert witness in the same case.

#### **4. Hostile Witness**
*   **Definition:** A witness who conceals the truth or gives false evidence, usually against the party that called them to testify.
*   **Legal Procedure:** The lawyer who called the witness requests the Court to declare the witness "hostile" (Adverse). Once declared hostile, the lawyer can cross-examine their own witness (Section 154 IEA).
*   **Reason:** Motive to conceal truth, bribery, or fear.

### **Comparison: Common vs. Expert Witness**

| Feature | Common Witness | Expert Witness |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | Witness of fact/observation. | Witness of opinion/skill. |
| **Testimony** | testifies to what they perceived (saw/heard). | Testifies to deductions/inferences drawn from facts. |
| **Knowledge** | No special technical knowledge required. | Specialized/Scientific knowledge required. |
| **Opinion** | **Cannot** give an opinion. | **Can** give an opinion. |
| **Volunteering** | Cannot volunteer statements. | Can volunteer a statement to prevent miscarriage of justice. |
| **Subpoena** | Can be compelled to testify facts. | Cannot be compelled to give an opinion against their will. |
| **Example** | Eyewitness to a crime. | Doctor, Ballistic expert. |

### **Sequence of Examination of a Witness**

The recording of evidence in court follows a strict order:

**1. Oath / Solemn Affirmation**
*   Before testifying, the witness must take an oath (in the name of God) or solemn affirmation.
*   *Quote:* "I do swear in the name of God that what I shall state shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."
*   **Section 51 IPC.**
*   *Exception:* Children below 12 years may not be required to take an oath if they do not understand its significance, but must speak the truth.

**2. Examination-in-Chief (Direct Examination)**
*   **Who:** Conducted by the lawyer of the side that called the witness (e.g., Public Prosecutor for a government doctor).
*   **Objective:** To elicit relevant facts favourable to their case.
*   **Rule:** **Leading questions are NOT allowed** (unless the witness is declared hostile).

**3. Cross-Examination**
*   **Who:** Conducted by the lawyer of the opposing party (e.g., Defense Lawyer).
*   **Objective:**
    *   To test the accuracy and truthfulness of the witness.
    *   To discredit the witness or modify facts.
    *   To elicit facts favourable to the defense.
*   **Rule:** **Leading questions ARE allowed.** This is often the most difficult part for a medical witness. It has no time limit.

**4. Re-Examination**
*   **Who:** Conducted again by the calling lawyer (e.g., Public Prosecutor).
*   **Objective:** To clarify discrepancies or clear up confusion arising from cross-examination.
*   **Rule:** No new matter can be introduced without the court's permission. No leading questions.

**5. Court Questions**
*   The **Judge** (Presiding Officer) can ask any question, in any form, at any stage to clear up doubts (**Section 165 IEA**).

### **Pertinent Legal Concepts**

#### **Leading Questions**
*   **Definition:** A question that suggests the answer the person putting it wishes or expects to receive (e.g., "Did you see Mr. X with a knife?" instead of "What did you see in Mr. X's hand?").
*   **Permissibility:**
    *   **Allowed:** In Cross-examination.
    *   **Not Allowed:** In Examination-in-chief and Re-examination (except for introductory undisputed matter or if the witness is hostile).
*   **Section 141-143 IEA.**

#### **Subpoena (Summons)**
*   A written document issued by the Court compelling the attendance of a witness under penalty.
*   **Subpoena duces tecum:** Summons to produce documents (e.g., Case sheets, X-rays) without necessarily engaging in oral testimony.
*   **Conduct Money:** Fee paid to a witness in **civil cases** to cover travel and stay expenses. In criminal cases, the state usually bears the cost (TA/DA).

#### **Perjury**
*   Willfully giving false evidence under oath.
*   Punishable under **Section 193 IPC** (up to 7 years imprisonment).

### **Duties of a Doctor in the Witness Box**

A medical officer is often the chief source of evidence. To be effective:
1.  **Preparation:** Read the [[Autopsy Report]] or Wound Certificate before entering the box. Do not memorize; you can refer to your report to "refresh memory" (**Section 159 IEA**).
2.  **Demeanor:** Be punctual, well-dressed, calm, and confident. Stand straight.
3.  **Answering:**
    *   Address the **Judge/Magistrate**, not the lawyer.
    *   Speak slowly and clearly (so the typist can record).
    *   Use simple language; avoid excessive medical jargon.
    *   **Do not lose your temper.** An angry witness is a poor witness.
    *   If you don't know the answer, firmly say **"I do not know."** Do not guess.
    *   Be objective and impartial. You are a witness of science, not for the prosecution or defense.
4.  **Double-Edged Sword:** Cross-examination can damage the prosecution as much as the defense if the doctor is not thorough.
