# [[Nose]] > Tumours of Sinuses

### Classification of Sinonasal Tumours

Tumours of the paranasal sinuses are less common than nasal cavity tumours but are often malignant. They are classified based on tissue of origin and behavior.

| Category | Tumour Type |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Benign Epithelial** | [[Squamous Papilloma]], [[Inverted Papilloma]] (Ringertz Tumour), [[Pleomorphic Adenoma]] |
| **Benign Mesenchymal** | [[Osteoma]], [[Fibrous Dysplasia]], [[Ossifying Fibroma]], [[Chondroma]], [[Hemangioma]] |
| **Malignant Epithelial** | [[Squamous Cell Carcinoma]] (Most Common), [[Adenocarcinoma]], [[Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma]], [[Olfactory Neuroblastoma]] |
| **Malignant Mesenchymal** | [[Osteogenic Sarcoma]], [[Chondrosarcoma]], [[Rhabdomyosarcoma]], [[Lymphoma]] |
| **Odontogenic** | [[Ameloblastoma]] |

### Benign Tumours of Sinuses

#### 1. Osteoma
*   **Definition:** Benign, slow-growing osteogenic tumour composed of mature bone.
*   **Incidence:** Most common benign tumour of paranasal sinuses.
*   **Site:** [[Frontal Sinus]] (Most common) > Ethmoid > Maxillary > Sphenoid.
*   **Pathology:**
    *   **Ivory Osteoma:** Hard, dense, compact bone.
    *   **Cancellous Osteoma:** Spongy bone.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Often asymptomatic (incidental finding on X-ray).
    *   If large: Headache, facial deformity, proptosis, or obstruction of sinus ostium leading to [[Mucocele]].
*   **Imaging:**
    *   **X-ray/CT:** Well-demarcated, dense radio-opaque mass.
*   **Treatment:** Surgical removal if symptomatic. Asymptomatic cases are observed.

#### 2. Fibrous Dysplasia
*   **Definition:** Normal bone is replaced by fibrous tissue and immature woven bone.
*   **Site:** [[Maxilla]] is the most common site.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Painless asymmetry of face.
    *   Displacement of the eye (proptosis).
    *   Nasal obstruction.
*   **Imaging:**
    *   **CT Scan:** Characteristic **"Ground-glass appearance"** due to loss of normal trabecular pattern.
*   **Treatment:** Conservative. Surgical "resculpturing" or paring down of bone for cosmetic reasons. Radiotherapy is **contraindicated** (risk of malignant transformation).

#### 3. Inverted Papilloma (Ringertz Tumour)
*   **Definition:** A benign neoplastic proliferation of epithelium that grows *inward* into the stroma (endophytic) rather than outward.
*   **Site:** Lateral wall of nose (Middle meatus) extending into [[Maxillary Sinus]] and [[Ethmoid Sinus]].
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Unilateral nasal obstruction.
    *   Epistaxis (blood-stained discharge).
    *   Appears as a red/grey, friable, polypoidal mass resembling a nasal polyp.
*   **Clinical Implications:**
    *   **Recurrence:** High rate of recurrence after removal.
    *   **Malignancy:** Associated with [[Squamous Cell Carcinoma]] in 10–15% of cases.
*   **Treatment:** Medial [[Maxillectomy]] (via lateral rhinotomy or endoscopic approach). Simple polypectomy is insufficient.

### Malignant Tumours of Sinuses

**General Etiology:**
*   **Nickel and Chromium:** Associated with [[Squamous Cell Carcinoma]].
*   **Wood Dust:** Strongly associated with [[Adenocarcinoma]] (Ethmoid sinus) in furniture workers.
*   **Leather Industry:** Shoemakers.
*   **Chemicals:** Isopropyl oil, mustard gas.
*   **Habits:** Smoking, snuff usage.

#### 1. Carcinoma of Maxillary Sinus
This is the most common malignancy of the paranasal sinuses (approx. 80%).
*   **Histology:** [[Squamous Cell Carcinoma]] (most common), followed by [[Adenocarcinoma]] and [[Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma]].

**Clinical Features (Based on Direction of Spread):**
1.  **Medial Spread (Nasal Cavity):** Nasal obstruction, epistaxis, blood-stained discharge, epiphora (NLD obstruction).
2.  **Anterior Spread (Cheek):** Swelling of cheek, invasion of facial skin, infraorbital paresthesia.
3.  **Inferior Spread (Alveolus/Palate):** Loosening of teeth, dental pain, swelling in hard palate, ill-fitting dentures.
4.  **Superior Spread (Orbit):** Proptosis, diplopia, ophthalmoplegia.
5.  **Posterior Spread (Pterygopalatine Fossa):** [[Trismus]] (involvement of pterygoid muscles).

**Classification Systems:**
*   **Ohngren's Classification:** An imaginary line drawn from the **medial canthus** of the eye to the **angle of the mandible**.
    *   **Suprastructure:** Tumours postero-superior to the line (Poorer prognosis due to proximity to skull base/orbit).
    *   **Infrastructure:** Tumours antero-inferior to the line (Better prognosis).

**TNM Staging (Simplified for Exams):**
*   **T1:** Limited to antral mucosa; no bone erosion.
*   **T2:** Bone erosion of hard palate or middle meatus.
*   **T3:** Erosion of posterior wall, floor of orbit, or subcutaneous tissue.
*   **T4a:** Invasion of anterior orbital contents, skin of cheek, pterygoid plates, cribriform plate.
*   **T4b:** Invasion of orbital apex, dura, brain, cranial nerves (other than V2), nasopharynx, clivus.

**Diagnosis:**
*   **CT Scan:** To assess bony destruction (e.g., erosion of posterior wall).
*   **MRI:** Best for soft tissue extension, orbital/intracranial spread, and distinguishing tumour from secretions.
*   **Biopsy:** Essential for confirmation.

**Treatment:**
*   **Combined Therapy (Gold Standard):** Surgery followed by Radiotherapy.
*   **Surgery:**
    *   **Total Maxillectomy:** Removal of the entire maxilla.
    *   **Partial Maxillectomy:** For limited infrastructure tumours.
    *   **Extended Maxillectomy:** Including orbital exenteration if the orbital contents are involved.
*   **Surgical Approaches:**
    *   [[Weber-Fergusson Incision]] (Lateral rhinotomy with lip split).
    *   Midfacial degloving (sublabial approach, no external scar).

#### 2. Carcinoma of Ethmoid Sinus
*   **Associations:** Often occupational (woodworkers).
*   **Histology:** [[Adenocarcinoma]] is common here.
*   **Features:** Nasal obstruction, epistaxis, broadening of nasal root, lateral displacement of the eye.
*   **Treatment:** Surgery (Craniofacial resection if cribriform plate involved) + Radiotherapy.

#### 3. Olfactory Neuroblastoma (Esthesioneuroblastoma)
*   **Origin:** Olfactory epithelium in the upper nasal cavity/cribriform plate.
*   **Features:** Reddish-grey, vascular, polypoidal mass causing epistaxis and anosmia.
*   **Age:** Bimodal distribution (2nd and 6th decades).
*   **Treatment:** Craniofacial resection + Radiotherapy.

#### 4. Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma
*   **Origin:** Minor salivary glands of sinuses.
*   **Key Feature:** **Perineural Invasion** (skips along nerves), leading to high recurrence rate and distant metastasis (lungs) even years later.
