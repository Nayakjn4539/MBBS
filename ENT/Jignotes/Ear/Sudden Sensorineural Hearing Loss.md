# [[Ear]] > Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss

### Definition
**Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss (SSNHL)** is defined as a sensorineural hearing loss of **at least 30 dB** over at least **three contiguous frequencies** occurring within a period of **3 days** (72 hours) or less,,,.

*   **Clinical Implication:** It is considered an **otologic emergency**. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential because the prognosis correlates strongly with the speed of intervention,.

---

### Etiology (Causes)
In approximately **85–90%** of cases, the exact cause remains obscure and is termed **Idiopathic Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss**,,.
However, several theories and known causes exist:

#### 1. Viral Infection
*   Viral cochleitis or neuritis is a leading theory.
*   **Viruses implicated:** [[Mumps]] (most common), [[Measles]], [[Rubella]], [[Varicella Zoster]], [[Influenza]], [[Herpes Simplex Virus]], and [[Cytomegalovirus]],.

#### 2. Vascular Compromise
*   **Ischemia:** Thrombosis, embolism, or vasospasm of the **labyrinthine artery** (end artery) or cochlear artery,.
*   **Sludging:** Hypercoagulable states, [[Polycythemia]], or macroglobulinemia causing reduced blood flow.
*   **Hemorrhage:** Into the inner ear (e.g., in [[Leukemia]]).

#### 3. Membrane Rupture
*   Spontaneous rupture of delicate intracochlear membranes (Reissner’s membrane) or perilymph fistula at the oval or round window due to pressure changes (e.g., coughing, straining),.

#### 4. Neoplastic
*   **[[Acoustic Neuroma]] (Vestibular Schwannoma):** Although typically slow-growing, 5–10% of patients with acoustic neuroma present with sudden hearing loss due to vascular compression or hemorrhage into the tumor,,.

#### 5. Others
*   **Autoimmune:** [[Cogan’s Syndrome]], [[Systemic Lupus Erythematosus]].
*   **Trauma:** Head injury, acoustic trauma, or iatrogenic (ear surgery).
*   **Ototoxic Drugs:** [[Aminoglycosides]].

### Clinical Features
*   **Onset:** Sudden, often noticed upon waking up or trying to use the telephone with the affected ear.
*   **Laterality:** Usually **unilateral** (bilateral in <2% of cases).
*   **[[Tinnitus]]:** Present in ~70–80% of cases; may precede or accompany the loss,.
*   **[[Vertigo]]:** Temporary spells of vertigo or disequilibrium may occur (indicates poor prognosis),.
*   **Aural Fullness:** A sensation of pressure or blockage in the ear.

### Diagnosis and Investigation

#### 1. History and Physical Examination
*   Rule out wax impaction, foreign bodies, or acute otitis media.
*   Check for history of trauma, recent viral infection, or ototoxic drug use.
*   **Neurological Exam:** Assess cranial nerves (especially CN V and VII) and cerebellar function to rule out central causes or CP angle tumors.

#### 2. Tuning Fork Tests
*   **Rinne Test:** **Positive** (AC > BC) in the affected ear (indicates sensorineural loss),.
*   **Weber Test:** Lateralizes to the **better/healthy ear**,.

#### 3. Audiometry
*   **[[Pure Tone Audiometry]] (PTA):** Confirms SNHL. The curve may be:
    *   **Low frequency loss:** (Upsloping) – Better prognosis.
    *   **Flat loss.**
    *   **High frequency loss:** (Downsloping) – Poor prognosis.
*   **Impedance Audiometry:** Usually normal (Type A curve) unless there is associated middle ear pathology.

#### 4. Imaging
*   **[[MRI]] with Gadolinium:** **Gold Standard** to rule out [[Retrocochlear Pathology]] like Acoustic Neuroma,,.

#### 5. Laboratory Tests
To identify systemic causes,:
*   CBC, ESR, CRP (Infection/Inflammation).
*   Blood Sugar (Diabetes).
*   Thyroid profile (Hypothyroidism).
*   VDRL/FTA-ABS (Syphilis).
*   Autoimmune profile (ANA).
*   Lipid profile.

### Treatment
Treatment is largely empirical due to the idiopathic nature. The window of opportunity is narrow (best within 2 weeks).

#### 1. Corticosteroids (Mainstay)
*   **Systemic Steroids:** Oral Prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day, max 60mg) for 1–2 weeks, followed by a taper. They reduce cochlear edema and inflammation,,.
*   **Intratympanic Steroids:** Injections of Dexamethasone or Methylprednisolone directly into the middle ear. Used as primary therapy or salvage therapy if systemic steroids fail or are contraindicated (e.g., in diabetics),,.

#### 2. Vasodilators and Rheologic Agents
*   **Carbogen Inhalation:** Mixture of **5% CO2 + 95% O2**. Increases cochlear blood flow and oxygenation,,.
*   **Low Molecular Weight Dextran:** Decreases blood viscosity and improves microcirculation,.
*   **Pentoxifylline:** Improves red blood cell deformability.

#### 3. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT)
*   Inhalation of 100% oxygen at high pressure. Increases perilymph oxygen tension. Approved by UHMS for SSNHL,.

#### 4. Antivirals
*   Drugs like Acyclovir are sometimes used, though evidence of benefit is conflicting,.

#### 5. General Measures
*   Bed rest.
*   Low salt diet (if hydrops is suspected).
*   Treatment of underlying comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension).

### Prognosis
Approximately **50–65%** of patients recover spontaneously within 15 days,. The "Rule of Thirds" applies:
*   1/3 recover completely.
*   1/3 recover partially.
*   1/3 do not recover.

| **Good Prognostic Factors** | **Poor Prognostic Factors** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Mild to moderate hearing loss | Severe to profound hearing loss (>90 dB) |
| Low-frequency loss (Upsloping curve) | High-frequency loss (Downsloping curve) |
| Early treatment (<1 week) | Delayed treatment (>2 weeks) |
| Age <40 years | Old age (>60 years) or very young |
| Absence of vertigo | Presence of [[Vertigo]] |
| | ESR > 35 mm/hr |,,
