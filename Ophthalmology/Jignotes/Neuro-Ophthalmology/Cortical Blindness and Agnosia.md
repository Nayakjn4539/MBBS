# [[Neuro-Ophthalmology]] > Cortical Blindness and Agnosia

# Cortical Blindness

### Definition
[[Cortical blindness]] refers to the total or partial loss of vision in one or both eyes resulting from bilateral lesions of the [[visual cortex]] (occipital lobes), specifically the [[striate cortex]] (Area 17), with normal anterior visual pathways (eye to lateral geniculate body).

### Etiology
The condition typically arises from damage to the [[posterior visual pathway]].
*   **Vascular Lesions (Most Common):** Bilateral [[occipital lobe infarction]], often due to embolization or thrombosis of the [[posterior cerebral arteries]].
*   **Trauma:** Severe head injury involving the occiput.
*   **Tumors:** Primary (e.g., bilateral gliomas) or metastatic lesions.
*   **Hypoxia:** Hypoxic encephalopathy (e.g., cardiac arrest, carbon monoxide poisoning).
*   **Infections:** Meningitis, encephalitis.
*   **Others:** [[Schilder's disease]], [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]], and severe [[preeclampsia]] (eclampsia).

### Clinical Features
The presentation can be dramatic and is characterized by a specific constellation of signs:

1.  **Bilateral Loss of Vision:** Ranges from severe impairment to total blindness (No PL).
2.  **Normal Pupillary Reflexes:** The [[pupillary light reflex]] remains normal because the reflex pathway branches off at the pretectal nucleus (midbrain), bypassing the damaged visual cortex.
3.  **Normal Fundus:** The optic disc and retina appear normal (unless there is unrelated ocular pathology).
4.  **[[Anton's Syndrome]] (Visual Anosognosia):** The patient denies being blind and may confabulate to describe their surroundings. This occurs due to the disconnection of the visual cortex from the association areas.
5.  **[[Riddoch Phenomenon]] (Statokinetic Dissociation):** The patient has the ability to perceive moving targets (kinetic vision) but cannot perceive stationary ones (static vision).
6.  **Preservation of Imagery:** Visual imagination and visual imagery in dreams are often preserved.

### Diagnosis and Investigations
*   **[[Visual Evoked Potential]] (VEP):** Used to differentiate organic from functional loss. In cortical blindness, the VEP is absent or markedly abnormal. In functional blindness (malingering/hysteria), the VEP is normal.
*   **Neuroimaging:** [[MRI]] or [[CT scan]] of the brain to localize the lesion (e.g., occipital infarcts).

### Differential Diagnosis
It is crucial to differentiate cortical blindness from psychogenic visual loss.

| Feature | [[Cortical Blindness]] | [[Malingering]] / [[Hysterical Blindness]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pupillary Reflex** | Normal | Normal |
| **Fundus** | Normal | Normal |
| **Mobility** | Difficulty navigating | Often navigates surprisingly well |
| **VEP** | **Absent/Abnormal** | **Normal** |
| **OKN (Optokinetic Nystagmus)** | Absent | Present (usually) |
| **Anton's Syndrome** | May be present | Absent |

### Management
*   **Treat the Underlying Cause:** Control blood pressure, manage stroke, etc.
*   **Prognosis:** Partial or complete recovery may occur, often progressing through stages of [[visual agnosia]].

# Disorders of Higher Visual Function

When the primary visual cortex is intact but the association areas are damaged, disorders of recognition and interpretation occur.

## 1. Visual Agnosia
**Definition:** A rare disorder where the patient cannot recognize objects by sight despite having adequate visual acuity and visual fields. However, the ability to recognize objects by touch (stereognosis), smell, or sound is retained.

**Site of Lesion:** Bilateral inferior (ventromedial) [[occipitotemporal junction]].

### Types of Visual Agnosia
*   **[[Prosopagnosia]]:** Inability to recognize familiar faces.
*   **[[Object Agnosia]]:** Inability to name an object or demonstrate its use when seen, though the patient can name it if touched.
*   **[[Visual Spatial Agnosia]]:** Difficulty with spatial orientation and topographical memory.

### Associated Features
*   Bilateral [[homonymous hemianopia]].
*   [[Dyschromatopsia]] (acquired color blindness).

## 2. Alexia (Word Blindness)
**Definition:** The inability to read despite good vision. It is distinct from [[dyslexia]], which is a developmental defect.

**Types:**
*   **[[Alexia]] with [[Agraphia]]:** Inability to read *and* write.
    *   *Lesion:* [[Angular gyrus]] of the dominant hemisphere.
*   **Alexia without Agraphia:** Inability to read, but the patient *can* write (though they cannot read what they have just written).
    *   *Lesion:* Left occipital lobe (destroying the visual cortex) + Splenium of the [[corpus callosum]] (interrupting fibers from the right visual cortex to the left language center).

## 3. Visual Hallucinations
Perception of visual images that are not present.
*   **Unformed (Elementary):** Flashes of light, stars, geometric shapes.
    *   *Origin:* [[Occipital lobe]] lesions or [[migraine]].
*   **Formed (Complex):** Seeing people, animals, or objects.
    *   *Origin:* [[Temporal lobe]] lesions.
    *   *[[Charles Bonnet Syndrome]]:* Formed hallucinations in mentally healthy elderly individuals with severe bilateral visual loss (e.g., from ARMD or cataract).

## 4. Visual Illusions (Metamorphopsia/Distortions)
*   **[[Palinopsia]]:** Persistence or recurrence of a visual image after the stimulus has been removed.
*   **[[Visual Allesthesia]] (Optic Allesthesia):** Transposition of visual images to a different point in space (false orientation).
*   **[[Cerebral Polyopia]]:** Seeing multiple images of a single object (does not disappear on closing one eye).
