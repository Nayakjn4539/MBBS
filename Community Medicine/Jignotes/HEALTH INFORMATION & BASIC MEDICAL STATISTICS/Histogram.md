# [[HEALTH INFORMATION & BASIC MEDICAL STATISTICS]] > Histogram

### Histogram

A **Histogram** is a graphical presentation of a [[Frequency Distribution]] table. It is specifically used for **continuous [[Quantitative Data]]**. Unlike a bar diagram, which is used for qualitative/discrete data, a histogram displays data where there is no natural demarcation between categories (e.g., height, weight, blood pressure).

### Key Characteristics
1.  **Structure:** It consists of a series of **blocks or rectangles**.
2.  **Axes:**
    *   **Horizontal Axis (X-axis/Abscissa):** Represents the **class intervals** of the variable (e.g., Blood pressure 110–120, 120–130).
    *   **Vertical Axis (Y-axis/Ordinate):** Represents the **frequency** (number of observations).
3.  **Continuity:** The blocks are drawn **adjacent to each other without any gaps**. This signifies the continuous nature of the data (the upper limit of one class is the lower limit of the next).
4.  **Area Principle:**
    *   The **area** of each rectangle is proportional to the frequency.
    *   If the class intervals are **uniform** (equal width), the **height** of the rectangle is directly proportional to the frequency.
    *   *Note:* If class intervals are unequal, the height must be adjusted so that the area correctly represents the frequency density.

### Comparison: Histogram vs. Bar Diagram

| Feature | [[Histogram]] | [[Bar Diagram]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type of Data** | **Continuous Quantitative** (e.g., Weight, BP, Age) | **Qualitative / Discrete** (e.g., Sex, Blood Group) |
| **Construction** | Bars **touch** each other (No gaps) | Bars are separated by **gaps** |
| **Measurement** | **Area** of the bar represents frequency | **Height/Length** of the bar represents frequency |
| **Width of Bars** | Depends on class interval (can be unequal) | Width is usually kept uniform for aesthetics |

### Related Statistical Graphs derived from Histogram

1.  **[[Frequency Polygon]]:**
    *   Created by joining the **mid-points** of the top of the histogram blocks with straight lines.
    *   It is useful for comparing two or more frequency distributions on the same graph.

2.  **[[Frequency Curve]]:**
    *   When the number of observations is very large and the class intervals are reduced to be very small, the frequency polygon loses its angulation and becomes a smooth curve.
    *   Example: The **[[Normal Distribution Curve]]** (Gaussian curve) is essentially a smooth frequency curve derived from a histogram of infinite observations.

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Epidemiology:** Used to visualize the distribution of a disease or health parameter in a population (e.g., distribution of Hemoglobin levels in pregnant women).
*   **Data Analysis:** Helps researchers quickly identify the **shape of distribution** (Normal, Skewed to the right, or Skewed to the left) and locate the central tendency (Mean/Mode) visually.

### Mnemonic
**"H-H-H"** for **H**istogram:
*   **H**ugging Bars (Bars touch each other)
*   **H**eight & Weight (Used for continuous variables)
*   **H**ow Frequent (Area represents frequency)
