# Models of Health Education

During the past few decades, several models of [[Health Education]] have been developed to explain human behavior and facilitate health promotion.

### 1. Medical Model
This was the earliest model developed along the lines of bio-medical views of health and disease.
*   **Focus:** Recognition and treatment of disease (curing) and technological advances.
*   **Mechanism:** Relies on the dissemination of health information based on scientific facts.
*   **Assumption:** It assumes that people will act on the information supplied by health professionals to improve their health.
*   **Limitation:** This model ignores **social, cultural, and psychological factors**. It failed to bridge the gap between [[knowledge]] and [[behavior]].

### 2. Motivation Model
When mere information transfer failed to produce action, this model emphasized **motivation** as the main force to translate health information into desired health action.
*   **Key Concept:** The adoption of a new behavior or idea is a process, not a single act.
*   **Stages of Change (Adoption Model):** Sociologists describe the following stages an individual passes through,:
    1.  **Awareness:** The individual gets general information about the subject/health problem.
    2.  **Motivation:** Includes interest, evaluation, and decision-making.
        *   *Interest:* Seeking detailed info.
        *   *Evaluation:* Weighing social, economic, and psychological aspects.
        *   *Decision-making:* Deciding to accept or reject the idea.
    3.  **Action/Adoption:** The individual tries the new practice.
    4.  **Internalization:** The new behavior becomes part of the individual's values.

### 3. Social Intervention Model
This model addresses the limitations of the motivation model by recognizing that often the **social environment** needs changing rather than just the individual.
*   **Key Concept:** **Legitimation**. People will not readily accept a new idea until it has been approved ("legitimated") by the group to which they belong.
*   **Application:** Group support is vital for decision-making.
*   **Clinical Relevance:** In programs like [[Family Planning]], adoption of methods like vasectomy or loop insertion is significantly higher when there is group support and social approval.
*   **Requirement:** Effective application requires knowledge of human ecology and the interaction between cultural, biological, and physical environmental factors.
