# [[Communicable Diseases - Zoonoses]] > Yellow Fever

# **Yellow Fever**

### **1. Epidemiological Determinants**

*   **Definition:** It is an acute viral hemorrhagic zoonotic disease caused by a Group B arbovirus.
*   **Agent Factor:**
    *   **Agent:** [[Flavivirus fibricus]] (family Togaviridae/Flaviviridae).
    *   **Characteristics:** It is an RNA virus. It is pantropic (affects multiple tissues) and viscerotropic (affects organs).
*   **Reservoir of Infection:**
    *   **Forest Areas:** Monkeys and forest mosquitoes.
    *   **Urban Areas:** Man and *Aedes aegypti* mosquitoes.
*   **Vector:**
    *   **Urban:** [[Aedes aegypti]].
    *   **Jungle/Forest:** *Aedes africanus* (Africa), *Haemagogus* (Americas).
    *   **Extrinsic Incubation Period:** 8–12 days in the mosquito.
    *   **Infectivity:** Once infected, the mosquito remains infective for life. Transovarial transmission occurs in mosquitoes.

### **2. Transmission Cycles**

*   **Sylvatic (Jungle) Cycle:** Monkey $\rightarrow$ Forest Mosquito $\rightarrow$ Monkey. Man is an accidental host (e.g., woodcutters).
*   **Urban Cycle:** Man $\rightarrow$ *Aedes aegypti* $\rightarrow$ Man. Large epidemics occur when infected people introduce the virus into densely populated areas.
*   **Intermediate Cycle:** Occurs in humid Africa; semi-domestic mosquitoes infect both monkeys and humans.

**Risk of Human-to-Human Transmission:**
*   There is **no** direct person-to-person transmission via contact.
*   However, the blood of patients is infective during the first 3–4 days of illness, allowing transmission via mosquitoes.

### **3. Clinical Picture**

*   **Incubation Period:** 3 to 6 days.
*   **Clinical Spectrum:** varies from subclinical to severe.
*   **Severe Cases:**
    *   **Onset:** Sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, backache, and nausea.
    *   **Hemorrhagic Manifestations:** Epistaxis, melena, and the characteristic [[Black Vomit]] (hematemesis).
    *   **Organ Failure:** Jaundice (hepatic involvement) and Albuminuria/Anuria (renal failure).
    *   **Case Fatality Rate:** Can reach **80%** in severe cases.

### **4. Diagnosis**

*   **Clinical:** Fever with jaundice and hemorrhagic symptoms in an endemic area.
*   **Laboratory:**
    *   Isolation of virus from blood (first 3–4 days).
    *   Serology: IgM antibodies.
    *   **Note:** Liver biopsy is contraindicated due to risk of bleeding.

### **5. Treatment**

*   There is **no specific antiviral drug**.
*   Treatment is **symptomatic and supportive** (treating dehydration, fever, and liver/kidney failure).

### **6. Prevention: The 17D Vaccine**

Immunization is the most effective control strategy.

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Type** | [[Live Attenuated Vaccine]] (Freeze-dried). |
| **Strain** | **17D Strain** (grown in chick embryo). |
| **Dose** | **0.5 ml**. |
| **Route** | **Subcutaneous** (Insertion of Deltoid). |
| **Reconstitution** | Only with cold **Physiological Saline**. |
| **Storage** | Very heat sensitive. Store between +5°C and -30°C. |
| **Usage Time** | Use within **30 minutes** (half an hour) of reconstitution. |
| **Immunity** | Begins on **7th day**; lasts for **Life**. |

**Contraindications for Vaccine:**
1.  Children < 9 months.
2.  **Pregnancy** (except during outbreaks).
3.  Severe allergy to **Egg protein**.
4.  Immunodeficiency (Symptomatic HIV/AIDS).

**Vaccine Interactions:**
*   Cholera and Yellow Fever vaccines should not be given together. A gap of **3 weeks** is required to prevent interference.

### **Mnemonic for Vaccine Contraindications**
**P.U.R.E.**
*   **P**regnancy
*   **U**nder 9 months
*   **R**eaction to Eggs
*   **E**-mmunosuppression (Immunosuppression)

### **7. International Health Regulations (IHR) & Control**

Yellow fever is a notifiable disease under IHR.

**A. For Travellers:**
*   **Certificate:** A valid international certificate of vaccination is mandatory for travel to/from endemic zones (Africa/South America).
*   **Validity:** The certificate becomes valid **10 days** after vaccination and is valid for the **duration of life** (previously 10 years).
*   **Quarantine:** Unvaccinated travellers coming from endemic areas to receptive areas (like India) are quarantined for **6 days** (maximum incubation period).

**B. Vector Control:**
*   Airports/Seaports must be kept free of *Aedes* breeding.
*   **Aedes Aegypti Index:** Should be kept below **1%**.
*   Aircrafts/Ships are subjected to aerosol spraying.

### **8. Clinical Relevance: India and Yellow Fever**

*   **Status:** India is a **Yellow Fever Receptive Area**.
    *   This means the disease does not exist in India, but the conditions (Vector *Aedes aegypti* + Susceptible monkeys + Susceptible humans) exist to permit its spread if introduced.
    *   The **Missing Link** is the virus itself.
*   **Why no Yellow Fever in India?** (Hypotheses)
    1.  **Cross-Immunity:** Existing antibodies against Dengue, KFD, or West Nile (other flaviviruses) might protect the population.
    2.  **Vector Competence:** Indian *Aedes* might be less efficient at transmitting the strain.
