# [[PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IN OBSTETRICS, PAEDIATRICS AND GERIATRICS]] > Prepare an action plan to conduct an IEC campaign in your block to reduce anaemia among pregnant women.

### Action Plan for IEC Campaign to Reduce Anaemia Among Pregnant Women in a Block

**Goal:** To significantly reduce the prevalence of [[anaemia]] among pregnant women in the block through sustained behavior change, increased compliance with [[Iron Folic Acid (IFA)]] supplementation, and dietary modification.

**Target Audience:**
1.  **Primary:** [[Pregnant women]] and lactating mothers.
2.  **Secondary:** Husbands, Mothers-in-law (decision makers for diet).
3.  **Tertiary:** Community leaders, PRI members, School teachers.

### Phase 1: Situation Analysis and Planning (Week 1-2)

**Objective:** To assess the baseline knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) regarding anaemia and identify barriers to IFA compliance.

1.  **Baseline Survey:** Conduct a rapid assessment/survey via [[ANM]] and [[ASHA]] workers to determine current anaemia levels and reasons for non-compliance (e.g., fear of side effects like nausea/black stools).
2.  **Resource Assessment:** Ensure adequate stock of [[IFA tablets]] (Red colored for pregnant women), Albendazole, and testing kits (digital hemoglobinometers) at the PHC and Sub-centres.
3.  **Stakeholder Meeting:** Convene a meeting with the [[Block Medical Officer]], CDPO (ICDS), and Block Education Officer to ensure inter-sectoral convergence.

### Phase 2: Strategy and Message Development (Week 3)

**Core Communication Strategy:** **"Test, Treat, Talk" (T3)** Strategy under [[Anemia Mukt Bharat]].

**Key Messages (The "Talk" Component):**
*   **Diet:** Consumption of iron-rich foods (Green leafy vegetables, jaggery, pulses).
*   **Enhancers/Inhibitors:** Take IFA with lemon water/amla (Vitamin C enhances absorption); Avoid tea/coffee immediately after meals (inhibits absorption).
*   **Compliance:** Managing side effects (take pill at night to avoid nausea); Black stool is normal and indicates iron is working.
*   **Deworming:** One tablet of [[Albendazole]] (400mg) in the second trimester.

**Mnemonic for Health Workers (COUNSEL)**
*   **C:** Check Hb levels.
*   **O:** Offer IFA tablets (Red).
*   **U:** Understand dietary habits.
*   **N:** Note side effects fear.
*   **S:** Suggest Vitamin C intake.
*   **E:** Explain black stool is normal.
*   **L:** Link to follow-up.

### Phase 3: Implementation of IEC Campaign (Week 4-8)

This phase utilizes a mix of communication channels for maximum reach.

| Channel | Activity | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Interpersonal Communication (IPC)** | House-to-house visits by **[[ASHA]]** to monitor IFA consumption and counsel on diet. Use of **[[Mother and Child Protection Card (MCP Card)]]** as a tool. | ASHA / ANM |
| **Group Communication** | Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with pregnant women and mothers-in-law during **[[Village Health and Nutrition Day (VHND)]]** at Anganwadi centres. Cooking demonstrations for iron-rich recipes. | ANM / AWW |
| **Mass Media / Folk Media** | Nukkad Natak (Street Plays) at haats/markets focusing on the "myth vs. reality" of IFA tablets. Wall paintings and posters at Sub-centres/Panchayats. | Block Extension Educator (BEE) |
| **Digital Media** | Use of **[[Kilkari]]** audio messages sent to registered mobile numbers regarding nutrition and antenatal care. | MO / Data Entry Operator |
| **Community Events** | **Godh Bharai** (Baby Shower) Diwas at Anganwadis to distribute IFA and counsel expecting mothers. | Anganwadi Worker (AWW) |

### Phase 4: Service Delivery Strengthening (Concurrent)

*   **Screening Camps:** Conduct special screening camps (e.g., **[[Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan - PMSMA]]** on the 9th of every month) to identify high-risk anaemic women (Hb < 7 g/dl).
*   **Deworming:** Administer Albendazole 400 mg after the first trimester to prevent worm infestation-induced anaemia.
*   **Supply Chain:** Ensure **no stock-out** of IFA tablets at the village level (ASHA kits).

---

### Phase 5: Monitoring and Evaluation (Ongoing)

**Indicators for Success:**
1.  **Process Indicator:** Number of VHNDs held where anaemia counseling was done.
2.  **Outcome Indicator:** Percentage of pregnant women consuming 180 IFA tablets.
3.  **Impact Indicator:** Reduction in prevalence of anaemia (Hb < 11 g/dl) in the block over 6 months to 1 year.

**Feedback Mechanism:**
*   Review meetings with ASHAs/ANMs monthly at the PHC to discuss refusal cases and replenish stocks.
*   Tracking of severe anaemia cases for institutional delivery to prevent [[Maternal Mortality]].

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Maternal Risks:** Untreated anaemia increases the risk of **[[Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH)]]**, cardiac failure, and maternal death.
*   **Fetal Risks:** Increases risk of **[[Low Birth Weight (LBW)]]**, preterm birth, and IUGR.
*   **Management:**
    *   *Mild/Moderate Anaemia (7-11 g/dl):* 2 tablets of IFA daily (Therapeutic dose).
    *   *Severe Anaemia (< 7 g/dl):* Referral to FRU for parenteral iron (Iron Sucrose) or blood transfusion.
