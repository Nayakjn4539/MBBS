# Epidemiology of Tuberculosis

**Tuberculosis (TB)** is a specific infectious disease caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. It is a major public health problem and is often described as a **[[Barometer of Social Welfare]]** because its prevalence thrives in poor socio-economic conditions.

### 1. Epidemiological Determinants

#### A. Agent Factors
*   **Agent:** *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (Human strain is most common; Bovine strain is rare in India due to boiling milk),.
*   **Characteristics:** Facultative intracellular parasite, aerobic, acid-fast bacilli (AFB),.
*   **Source of Infection:** Human case with **[[sputum positive]]** pulmonary TB (most common).
*   **Communicability:** Patients are infective as long as they are untreated. Effective antimicrobial treatment reduces infectivity by **90% within 48 hours**.
*   **Viability:** Can survive in dried sputum for long periods but is killed by direct sunlight and heat.

#### B. Host Factors
*   **Age:** Affects all ages. Sharp rise in infection rates from childhood to adolescence.
*   **Gender:** More prevalent in **males** than females.
*   **Immunity:** Man has no inherited immunity. Acquired via natural infection or **[[BCG vaccination]]**. Cellular immunity (T-cells) is crucial.
*   **Predisposing Factors:**
    *   **[[Malnutrition]]** (reduces resistance).
    *   **[[HIV infection]]** (Most potent risk factor for progression to active TB).
    *   Diabetes, Silicosis, Tobacco smoking,.

#### C. Environmental & Social Factors
*   **Overcrowding:** Increases risk of transmission via droplet nuclei.
*   **Poor Housing/Ventilation:** Lack of sunlight and fresh air favors bacillary survival.
*   **Social Habits:** Indiscriminate spitting, smoking, and alcohol abuse.

#### D. Mode of Transmission
*   **Droplet Infection:** Coughing generates the largest number of droplets.
*   **Droplet Nuclei:** Tiny particles (1-5 microns) that remain suspended in air and are inhaled into alveoli.
*   **Not Fomites:** TB is **not** transmitted by dishes or articles used by patients.

# Prevention of Tuberculosis

Prevention strategies are classified into two main components:

### 1. Specific Protection (Primary Prevention)
**[[BCG Vaccination]]** (Bacille Calmette-Guerin)
*   **Type:** Live attenuated bacterial vaccine.
*   **Strain:** Danish 1331 strain.
*   **Dose:** 0.1 mg in 0.1 ml (0.05 ml for newborns < 1 month).
*   **Route:** **[[Intradermal]]** (left upper arm over deltoid).
*   **Efficacy:** Ranges 0-80%; highly effective in preventing severe forms like **[[Tubercular Meningitis]]** and Miliary TB in children.
*   **Contraindications:** Symptomatic HIV infection, severe immune deficiency.

> **Clinical Relevance:** Do **not** use spirit/antiseptic to clean the skin before BCG vaccination as it may kill the live bacteria in the vaccine.

### 2. Chemoprophylaxis (Preventive Therapy)
*   Targeted at high-risk groups to prevent the progression from latent infection to active disease.
*   **Target Groups:**
    1.  **[[PLHIV]]** (People Living with HIV).
    2.  Asymptomatic household contacts (children < 6 years) of smear-positive cases.
*   **Regimen (TPT - TB Preventive Therapy):**
    *   **Isoniazid (H)** daily for 6 months.
    *   **3HP:** Isoniazid + Rifapentine weekly for 3 months.

# Control of Tuberculosis

The goal is to break the chain of transmission.

### 1. Case Finding (Diagnosis)
Early detection is the most powerful weapon in TB control.
*   **Passive Case Finding:** Patients attending health facilities with symptoms (Cough > 2 weeks, fever, weight loss).
*   **Active Case Finding:** Screening vulnerable populations (slums, prisons, tribal areas).
*   **Diagnostic Tools:**
    *   **[[Sputum Microscopy]]** (ZN Stain): Screening tool.
    *   **[[CBNAAT]]** (GeneXpert): Rapid molecular test. Detects MTb and **Rifampicin resistance** in 2 hours. Preferred for HIV+, Paediatric, and Extra-pulmonary cases,.
    *   **Chest X-ray:** High sensitivity, low specificity.

### 2. Treatment (Chemotherapy)
*   **Objective:** Cure the patient and eliminate the bacterial pool (render patient non-infectious).
*   **Regimens:** Based on drug sensitivity status (Drug-Sensitive vs. Drug-Resistant).

### 3. Social Control
*   Improvement of quality of life, housing, and nutrition.
*   Health education regarding cough hygiene.

# Note on RNTCP (now NTEP)

The **Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP)** was launched in 1997 based on the DOTS strategy. It was renamed the **[[National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme]] (NTEP)** in 2020 to align with the goal of eliminating TB by 2025,.

### 1. Strategy Evolution
*   **DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course):** The core strategy where a health worker watches the patient swallow the medicine.
*   **STOP TB Strategy (2006):** Addressed HIV-TB and MDR-TB.
*   **END TB Strategy (Current):** Vision of zero deaths and zero suffering.

### 2. Key Objectives (NTEP)
*   Achieve a **cure rate of >85%**.
*   Achieve a **case detection rate of >70%**.
*   New Targets (90-90-90): Detect 90% cases, Treat 90% detected, Achieve 90% treatment success.

### 3. Organizational Structure
*   **National Level:** Central TB Division.
*   **District Level:** District TB Centre (DTC).
*   **Sub-District Level:** **[[Tuberculosis Unit]] (TU)** (1 per 1.5–2.5 lakh population). Key personnel: MO-TC, STS (Senior Treatment Supervisor), STLS (Senior TB Lab Supervisor),.
*   **Peripheral Level:** Peripheral Health Institutions (PHIs) and Designated Microscopy Centres (DMC).

### 4. Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (Current)
*   **Universal DST:** All diagnosed TB patients are offered testing for drug resistance (CBNAAT/TruNat).
*   **Daily Regimen:** Replaced the old intermittent (thrice-weekly) regimen.
*   **Fixed Dose Combinations (FDCs):** Combined pills given daily according to **weight bands**.

**Treatment Regimen for Drug-Sensitive TB (DSTB):**

| Phase | Duration | Drugs (Daily FDC) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Intensive Phase (IP)** | 2 Months | **H R Z E** (Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol) |
| **Continuation Phase (CP)**| 4 Months | **H R E** (Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Ethambutol) |
*,*

**Treatment for Drug-Resistant TB (MDR-TB):**
*   **Shorter Oral Regimen:** 9-11 months (Using Bedaquiline).
*   **Longer Oral Regimen:** 18-20 months for complex resistance.
*   **Newer Drugs:** **[[Bedaquiline]]** and Delamanid used for MDR/XDR-TB.

### 5. New Initiatives
*   **[[NIKSHAY]]**: Web-based case notification system for tracking patients.
*   **Nikshay Poshan Yojana:** Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) of Rs. 500/month to patients for nutrition support.
*   **99-DOTS:** IT-enabled adherence monitoring.
*   **Active Case Finding:** Targeted campaigns to reach unreached populations.

> **Mnemonic for First Line Drugs:** **RIPE**
> *   **R**ifampicin
> *   **I**soniazid
> *   **P**yrazinamide
> *   **E**thambutol
