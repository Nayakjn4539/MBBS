# [[Affections Of Soft Tissues]] > Tennis Elbow (Lateral Epicondylitis)

### [[Tennis Elbow]] (Lateral Epicondylitis)

**Tennis Elbow**, clinically known as **Lateral Epicondylitis**, is a painful condition affecting the tendinous origin of the wrist extensors at the lateral epicondyle of the humerus. Despite the name, it is commonly seen in non-athletes due to repetitive occupational stress.

#### **Etiology and Epidemiology**
*   **Incidence:** Most common in the **30–50 years** age group.
*   **Gender:** Affects both sexes equally.
*   **Predisposing Activities:**
    *   **Sports:** Faulty backhand technique in tennis.
    *   **Occupation:** Carpenters, plumbers, painters, cooks, and computer operators ("Key-board warrior's elbow").
    *   **Daily Chores:** Squeezing clothes (housewives), lifting heavy weights, or unaccustomed activity involving strenuous wrist movements.

#### **Pathophysiology**
*   **Site of Lesion:** The primary pathology involves the **Common Extensor Origin** at the lateral epicondyle.
*   **Muscle Involved:** The [[Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis]] (ECRB) is the most commonly and earliest affected muscle. The [[Extensor Carpi Radialis Longus]] (ECRL) may also be involved.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   Repetitive stress causes **micro-tears** in the tendon aponeurosis.
    *   This leads to a vascular repair process and the formation of granulation tissue, termed **"Angiofibroblastic Hyperplasia"** (Nirschl).
    *   It is technically a **tendinosis** (degenerative) rather than a pure tendinitis (inflammatory).

#### **Clinical Features**
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Pain:** Localized over the **lateral aspect of the elbow**.
    *   **Radiation:** Pain may radiate down the extensor aspect of the forearm.
    *   **Aggravating Factors:**
        *   Gripping objects.
        *   Pouring tea (extension of wrist with pronation).
        *   Turning a stiff door handle or using a screwdriver.
        *   Shaking hands.
        *   Lifting weights with the forearm pronated.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Tenderness:** Maximally present over the **anterior aspect of the lateral epicondyle**.
    *   **Range of Motion:** Elbow flexion and extension are usually full and painless.

#### **Special Clinical Tests**
1.  **[[Cozen's Test]]**:
    *   **Procedure:** The patient keeps the elbow flexed (or extended) and the forearm **pronated**. They are asked to make a fist and **extend** and **radially deviate** the wrist against resistance applied by the examiner.
    *   **Result:** Severe pain at the lateral epicondyle indicates a positive test.
2.  **[[Mill's Maneuver]]** (Also used as a treatment):
    *   **Procedure:** Forceful **pronation** of the forearm and **flexion** of the wrist while the elbow is extended.
    *   **Result:** Stretches the extensors and reproduces pain.
3.  **Wringing Test**:
    *   **Procedure:** Asking the patient to **wring a towel**.
    *   **Result:** Elicits pain at the lateral epicondyle.
4.  **[[Chair Test]]**:
    *   **Procedure:** The patient attempts to lift a chair with one hand, forearm pronated and elbow extended.
    *   **Result:** Difficulty or pain prevents lifting.

#### **Differential Diagnosis**
*   **Cervical Spondylosis:** Referred pain (C6-C7 radiculopathy).
*   **Radial Tunnel Syndrome:** Entrapment of the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN).
*   **Osteoarthritis:** Of the radio-capitellar joint.
*   **Painful Annular Ligament**: Hypertrophy of synovial fringe.

#### **Investigations**
*   **X-ray (Elbow AP/Lateral):** Usually normal. May show faint calcification along the lateral epicondyle in chronic cases (16%). Used primarily to rule out arthritis or loose bodies.
*   **USG/MRI:** Useful to identify the extent of tendon tear or degeneration in refractory cases.

#### **Treatment**
**A. Conservative Management (90% success rate)**
*   **Rest:** Avoidance of provocative activities (e.g., heavy lifting, repetitive gripping).
*   **Analgesics:** [[NSAIDs]] (Diclofenac, Naproxen) to reduce pain and inflammation.
*   **Physiotherapy:**
    *   **Ultrasonic therapy** and deep heat.
    *   **Stretching and strengthening exercises** (isometric and eccentric loading).
*   **Bracing:**
    *   **[[Tennis Elbow Brace]] (Counterforce Brace):** Applied around the proximal forearm (just distal to the elbow). It inhibits muscle expansion, reducing the tension transmitted to the origin.
*   **Injection Therapy:**
    *   **Local Steroid Injection:** (e.g., Hydrocortisone or Methylprednisolone) into the most tender spot. Very effective for short-term relief (40% cases) but risks recurrence or skin depigmentation/atrophy.
    *   **[[Platelet Rich Plasma]] (PRP):** Contains growth factors to promote healing.

**B. Manipulation**
*   **Mill's Maneuver:** Forceful extension of the elbow with the wrist fully flexed and forearm pronated to snap adhesions. Usually performed under local anesthesia.

**C. Surgical Management**
*   **Indications:** Refractory cases not responding to conservative treatment for 6-12 months.
*   **Procedures:**
    *   **Surgical Release:** Release of the common extensor origin (specifically ECRB) from the lateral epicondyle.
    *   **Excision:** Removal of the degenerated angiofibroblastic tissue.
    *   **Percutaneous release:** Using a needle to break up scar tissue.

**Clinical Implication:**
Patients often confuse the site of pain. **Tennis Elbow** is lateral (outer side), while **Golfer's Elbow** is medial (inner side). Remember, the ECRB muscle is the primary culprit in Tennis Elbow because it passes over the radial head, making it susceptible to wear during elbow motion.
