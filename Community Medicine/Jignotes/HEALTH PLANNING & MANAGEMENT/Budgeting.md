# [[HEALTH PLANNING & MANAGEMENT]] > Budgeting

### [[Budgeting]] in Health Management

**Definition**
A [[Budget]] is a systematic **economic plan** for a specific period of time. It incorporates politically and technically determined appropriations indicating how and for what purpose various health resources are to be used.

**Budgeting** refers to the *process* by which the budget comes into being. It acts as a tool for **fiscal planning**, **accounting**, and **control**.

#### Core Components of Budgeting
1.  **Appropriations:** Allocating specific amounts of funds for specific health activities.
2.  **Resource Allocation:** Distribution of money, manpower, and materials.
3.  **Time Frame:** Usually planned for a financial year.
4.  **Control:** Designating spending authority to ensure funds are used judiciously.

#### Key Budgeting Techniques
There are specific methods used to allocate resources efficiently in health systems:

**1. Planning-Programming-Budgeting System ([[PPBS]])**
*   **Concept:** It helps decision-makers allocate resources to achieve objectives in the most efficient way.
*   **Method:** It does *not* call for changes in the existing organization but groups activities into **programs** related to each specific objective.
*   **Goal:** To link specific inputs (money) to specific outputs (program results).

**2. Zero-Base Budgeting ([[ZBB]])**
*   **Concept:** Also known as the **"Zero Budget Approach"**.
*   **Method:** All budgets start at **zero**. No one gets a budget based on the previous year's allocation. Every penny requested must be specifically **justified** from scratch on a year-to-year basis.
*   **Advantage:** Eliminates wasteful expenditure that continues simply because "it was there last year."

**3. Program Budgeting**
*   This is the process that links budgeting to programming.
*   It is an essential component of the **Managerial Process for National Health Development ([[MPNHD]])**.

#### Comparison of Budgeting Approaches

| Feature | Conventional Budgeting | Zero-Base Budgeting (ZBB) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Starting Point** | Based on previous year's budget (Incremental) | Starts at **Zero** |
| **Justification** | Only increments need justification | **Entire** amount needs justification |
| **Priority** | Past activities often continue automatically | Activities are re-evaluated for priority annually |
| **Focus** | Cost control | Cost-benefit and utility |

#### Clinical and Managerial Relevance
*   **Resource Scarcity:** Health needs are infinite, but resources are limited. Budgeting ensures **[[cost-effectiveness]]**.
*   **Accountability:** It forces health administrators to be accountable for the "Input (Resources)" vs "Output (Health Status)" ratio.
*   **Opportunity Cost:** Proper budgeting forces the manager to consider what is being sacrificed to fund a specific project (Opportunity Cost).

> **Mnemonic for Zero-Base Budgeting (ZBB):**
> **Z** - **Z**ero balance start
> **B** - **B**aseline is ignored (previous year doesn't matter)
> **B** - **B**est justification needed for every rupee
