# [[Regional Injuries]] > Head Injury Skull Fractures

### Head Injury: Skull Fractures

A [[skull fracture]] is a break in the continuity of the skull bones caused by mechanical force. It implies significant violence and is often associated with intracranial damage, though fatal brain injury can occur without a skull fracture, and vice versa.

### Mechanisms of Fracture
Skull fractures are produced by two main mechanisms involving deformation:
1.  **General Deformation:** When the head strikes a broad, flat surface (e.g., ground), the skull is compressed/flattened. The fracture lines usually start at the point of impact and radiate outward or occur at a distance. This typically causes **fissured/linear fractures**.
2.  **Local Deformation:** When a weapon with a small striking surface (e.g., hammer, stone) strikes the head, the bone is driven inwards. The inner table fractures more extensively than the outer table. This typically causes **depressed fractures**.

**Force Required:**
*   **400–600 lbs/sq inch:** Required to fracture a cadaver skull covered by intact scalp.
*   **25 inch-pounds:** Sufficient to fracture an empty human skull.

### Classification of Skull Fractures

#### 1. Fissured (Linear) Fracture
*   **Definition:** A linear crack in the bone involving the whole thickness or only the outer/inner table.
*   **Incidence:** Most common type (approx. 70% of skull fractures).
*   **Cause:** Fall on a hard surface or blow with a broad instrument.
*   **Features:**
    *   Runs through the path of least resistance.
    *   Usually does not cross bony buttresses (e.g., glabella, occipital protuberance) but may cross suture lines.
    *   Often starts at the point of impact and runs parallel to the line of force.

#### 2. Depressed Fracture
*   **Definition:** A fracture where the fractured bone segment is driven inwards into the cranial cavity.
*   **Cause:** Localized impact by a heavy weapon with a small striking surface (e.g., hammer, stone, axe butt, stick).
*   **Pathology:** The outer table is driven into the diploe, while the inner table is fractured more irregularly and extensively.
*   **[[Fracture a la signature]] (Signature Fracture):** A type of depressed fracture where the pattern/shape of the depression corresponds to the striking surface of the weapon used (e.g., circular depression from a hammer). It helps in identifying the weapon.

#### 3. Comminuted Fracture
*   **Definition:** Bone is broken into multiple fragments (three or more) by intersecting fracture lines.
*   **Appearance:** Resembles a **"Spider's Web"** or "Mosaic" pattern when fragments are not displaced.
*   **Cause:** Significant force over a broad area (e.g., traffic accidents, repeated blows).

#### 4. Pond Fracture (Indented Fracture)
*   **Definition:** A simple dent or depression of the skull without a fracture of the inner table (fissures may occur on the outer table).
*   **Occurrence:** Seen in **infants** due to the elasticity of their skull bones.
*   **Synonym:** [[Ping-pong fracture]].
*   **Cause:** Obstetric forceps pressure or fall against a protruding object.

#### 5. Sutural (Diastatic) Fracture
*   **Definition:** Separation of the skull bones at the cranial sutures.
*   **Occurrence:** Common in young adults/children before suture fusion.
*   **Cause:** Blow with a blunt weapon.

#### 6. Ring Fracture
*   **Definition:** A fissure fracture encircling the foramen magnum in the posterior cranial fossa.
*   **Mechanism:** Indirect violence driving the skull against the spine or vice versa.
    *   Fall from a height landing on feet/buttocks (Spine driven into skull).
    *   Heavy weight falling on the head (Skull driven into spine).
    *   Blow to the chin or vertex.

#### 7. Gutter Fracture
*   **Definition:** A fracture where part of the bone thickness is removed, forming a furrow or gutter.
*   **Cause:** Oblique bullet wounds.

#### 8. Elevated Fracture
*   **Definition:** One end of the fractured fragment is elevated above the skull surface while the other is depressed.
*   **Cause:** Blow from a heavy sharp weapon (e.g., chopper, axe).

### Fractures of the Base of Skull
Base fractures are often due to indirect force (transmitted from the vault, chin, or spine) or direct crushing.

| Fracture Site | Clinical Signs/Findings | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Anterior Cranial Fossa]]** | 1. **Epistaxis:** Bleeding from nose.<br>2. **CSF Rhinorrhea:** CSF leakage through nose (fracture of cribriform plate).<br>3. **[[Spectacle Hematoma]] (Panda/Raccoon Eyes):** Bilateral periorbital ecchymosis (blood tracking into orbits).<br>4. Subconjunctival hemorrhage (triangular shape). | Direct impact on forehead or heavy blow to chin. |
| **[[Middle Cranial Fossa]]** | 1. **CSF Otorrhea:** CSF leakage through ear.<br>2. **Bleeding from Ear:** Fracture of petrous temporal bone.<br>3. **[[Battle's Sign]]:** Bruising over the mastoid region (appears 24-48 hours later).<br>4. VII & VIII cranial nerve palsy. | Direct impact behind the ear or crush injury. |
| **[[Posterior Cranial Fossa]]** | 1. Extravasation of blood in the nape of the neck.<br>2. Pharyngeal bleeding.<br>3. Involvement of Foramen Magnum. | Direct impact on the back of the head. |

#### Hinge Fracture (Motorcyclist's Fracture)
*   A transverse fracture extending across the base of the skull (usually middle fossa), effectively splitting the base into two halves.
*   **Sign:** **Nodding Face Sign** (abnormal mobility of the maxilla/base).
*   **Cause:** Side-to-side compression or heavy blow to the side of the head (common in run-over cases or motorcycle accidents).

### Important Rules and Phenomenon

#### 1. [[Puppe's Rule]]
*   **Definition:** A later fracture line will **not cross** a pre-existing fracture line; it stops where it meets the earlier fracture.
*   **Significance:** It helps in determining the **sequence of blows** (chronology) in cases of multiple head injuries.

#### 2. Coup and Contrecoup Injuries
*   **[[Coup injury]]:** Injury to the skull/brain occurring at the **site of impact**.
*   **[[Contrecoup injury]]:** Injury occurring on the **opposite side** of the brain/skull from the impact (due to brain movement/deceleration).
    *   *Example:* A fall on the back of the head (occiput) often causes contusions in the frontal and temporal lobes.

### Medicolegal Aspects of Skull Fractures
1.  **Nature of Violence:**
    *   **Fissured fractures:** Suggest broad impact surface (e.g., fall).
    *   **Depressed fractures:** Suggest localized impact (e.g., hammer, rod).
    *   **Cut fractures:** Suggest sharp heavy weapons (e.g., axe, chopper).
2.  **Force:** Identifying the type of fracture helps estimate the degree of force used.
3.  **Cause of Death:** Skull fractures themselves are not always fatal; death is usually due to associated **intracranial hemorrhage** (Extradural, Subdural) or **brain injury** (Contusion, Laceration).
4.  **Identification of Weapon:** Possible in "Fracture a la signature".

### Autopsy Findings & Procedure
1.  **External:** Palpate the scalp for "boggy" swelling or step-offs. Note that hematomas can mimic depressed fractures on palpation.
2.  **Scalp Reflection:** Reflect the scalp completely to visualize the calvarium. Fresh fractures show reddish infiltration of blood in the edges (Vital Reaction).
3.  **Skull Opening:** Saw the skull in a V-shape. **Do not use a chisel and hammer forcefully**, as this may create artificial fractures (Artefacts).
4.  **Dura Stripping:** The dura mater must be stripped from the base of the skull to detect basal fractures, which might otherwise be missed.
5.  **Artifacts:**
    *   **Heat Fractures:** In burn cases, the skull may fracture due to steam pressure or drying. These are often localized above the temples and may cross suture lines.
    *   **Autopsy Artefacts:** Forceful prying of the skull cap can cause fractures in the middle cranial fossa.
