# Surgical Instruments in Ophthalmology

The following tables categorize ophthalmic surgical instruments based on their primary function and anatomical target.

### 1. Lid Speculums and Retractors
These instruments are essential for exposure of the surgical field.

| Instrument Name | Description/Features | Function/Uses |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Universal Metallic Eye Speculum]]** | Has two limbs with a spring mechanism and a screw to adjust the width. Blades are open. | To keep the [[Eyelids]] apart during intraocular surgeries ([[Cataract]], [[Glaucoma]], [[Keratoplasty]]) and extraocular surgeries ([[Squint]], [[Pterygium]]). |
| **Eye Speculum with Guard** | Similar to universal but with solid blades/guards. | Retracts lids while keeping the [[Eyelashes]] away from the surgical field to prevent contamination. |
| **[[Wire Speculum]]** (Barraquer) | Very light wire structure without a screw mechanism. | Causes minimal pressure on the [[Eyeball]]; useful in pediatric cases or open globe injuries. |
| **[[Desmarre’s Retractor]]** | Saddle-shaped instrument folded at one end; available in pediatric and adult sizes. | Retracts lids for examination in [[Blepharospasm]], removal of corneal sutures/foreign bodies, and double eversion of the upper lid. |
| **Muller’s Retractor** | Self-retaining lacrimal wound retractor with curved pins. | Retracts skin during lacrimal sac surgeries like [[Dacryocystorhinostomy]] (DCR). |
| **Cat’s Paw Retractor** | Fork-like instrument with inwardly bent terminals. | Retracts skin during lacrimal sac and lid surgery. |

**Clinical Implication:**
*   **Pressure Management:** The [[Wire Speculum]] is preferred when minimizing pressure on the globe is critical, such as in open globe injuries, to prevent expulsion of intraocular contents.

### 2. Forceps
Forceps are designed for grasping, holding, and manipulating specific tissues.

| Instrument Name | Description/Features | Function/Uses |

| **[[Superior Rectus Holding Forceps]]** | Toothed forceps (1x2) with an S-shaped double curve near the tip. | Holding the [[Superior Rectus Muscle]] to pass a bridle suture for stabilizing the eye in downward gaze. |
| **Corneoscleral Forceps** (e.g., Colibri, Lim's) | Very fine teeth (1x2) at the tip. | Holding corneal or scleral edges for suturing during [[Cataract]], [[Glaucoma]], or [[Keratoplasty]]. |
| **[[Iris Forceps]]** | Small, delicate with fine teeth on the inner side. | Grasping the [[Iris]] for iridectomy (optical or peripheral) or excision of prolapsed iris. |
| **[[Arruga’s Intracapsular Forceps]]** | Cup on the inner side of the tip with smooth margins. | Historically used for [[Intracapsular Cataract Extraction]] (ICCE) to grasp the lens capsule; now used to remove capsular remnants. |
| **[[Epilation Forceps]]** | Small, stout forceps with blunt/flat ends. | Mechanical removal of eyelashes in [[Trichiasis]] and [[Stye]]. |
| **[[Artery Forceps]]** (Hemostatic) | Blunt-tipped, stout with locking mechanism (mosquito type). | Catching bleeding vessels (hemostasis), holding stay sutures, or holding gauze pellets for dissection. |
| **[[IOL Holding Forceps]]** | Spring action, short blunt curved blades, smooth edges. | Holding the optic of non-foldable [[PMMA]] [[Intraocular Lens]] during implantation. |
| **[[Kelman-McPherson Forceps]]** | Fine forceps with bent limbs. | Holding IOL haptics, tearing anterior capsule flaps in ECCE, and suture tying. |
| **[[Capsulorhexis Forceps]]** | Very fine-tipped delicate forceps. | Holding and tearing the anterior lens capsule during Continuous Curvilinear Capsulorhexis (CCC). |

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Differentiate between the teeth of Iris forceps (fine, 1x2) and Artery forceps (transverse serrations)

| **[[Keratome]]** | Diamond-shaped blade with a sharp apex; sizes 2.8mm to 5.5mm. | Making valvular corneal incisions for entering the [[Anterior Chamber]] in [[Phacoemulsification]] and [[Small Incision Cataract Surgery]] (SICS). |
| **[[Crescent Knife]]** | Blunt-tipped, bevel-up knife with cut-splitting action. | Making scleral tunnels in SICS and Phaco; separating conjunctiva/pterygium head. |
| **[[Side Port Blade]]** (15°) | Fine straight knife with sharp pointed tip. | Making small valvular side-port incisions (paracentesis) for bimanual manipulation. |
| **[[MVR Blade]]** (V-lance) | Fine straight triangular knife; cutting edges on both sides. | Similar uses to side port blade; creating sclerotomies. |
| **[[Cystotome]]** | Small needle knife with a bent tip (often made from 26G needle). | Performing anterior capsulotomy (can-opener or CCC) in cataract surgery. |
| **[[Tooke’s Knife]]** | Short flat blade with a semicircular blunt dissecting edge. | Separating conjunctiva/Tenon’s capsule from sclera; lamellar dissection in [[Trabeculectomy]]. |
| **[[Von Graefe’s Knife]]** | Long, narrow, thin straight blade. | Historically used for cataract incisions; now obsolete but sometimes used for ab-interno incisions. |
| **Razor Blade Fragment** | Small piece of razor blade on a holder. | Cost-effective tool for making incisions in cataract, glaucoma, and pterygium surgeries. |

### 4. Scissors
Scissors vary by curvature and tip sharpness for specific tissues.

| Instrument Name | Description/Features | Function/Uses |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Westcott’s Scissors]]** (Spring) | Stout scissors with spring action. | Cutting and undermining conjunctiva; cutting sutures. Handy alternative to ringed scissors. |
| **[[Vannas Scissors]]** | Very fine, delicate scissors with spring action. | Cutting anterior capsule (capsulotomy), cutting inner scleral flap in trabeculectomy, iridectomy, or sphincterotomy. |
| **[[de Wecker’s Scissors]]** | Blades at right angles to arms; V-shape spring action. | Performing [[Iridectomy]] or cutting prolapsed vitreous. |
| **Corneal Scissors** | Fine curved scissors (Right and Left types). | Enlarging corneal/corneoscleral incisions in Keratoplasty or conventional ECCE. |
| **[[Tenotomy Scissors]]** | Blunt-ended straight or curved scissors. | Cutting extraocular muscles in [[Squint]] surgery or enucleation; blunt dissection of tissues. |
| **[[Enucleation Scissors]]** | Large, stout, strong scissors with curved blades. | Cutting the [[Optic Nerve]] during enucleation. |

**Clinical Implication:**
*   **Precision:** [[Vannas Scissors]] are extremely delicate; using them for tough tissues like skin or sclera will ruin the blades. They are reserved for capsule and iris.
