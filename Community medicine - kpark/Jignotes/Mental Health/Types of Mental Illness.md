# [[Mental Health]] > Types of Mental Illness

### Classification and Types of Mental Illness

Mental and behavioural disorders are understood as clinically significant conditions characterized by alterations in **thinking**, **mood (emotions)**, or **behaviour** associated with personal distress and/or impaired functioning.

These disorders are broadly classified based on the **ICD-10** (International Classification of Diseases) criteria or the **DSM** (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) criteria,.

#### 1. Broad Classification (Traditional)
Traditionally, mental illnesses are divided into two major groups based on the patient's contact with reality:

*   **[[Psychosis]] (Major Illnesses):** The person is considered "insane" and is out of touch with reality.
*   **[[Neurosis]] (Minor Illnesses):** The patient is unable to react normally to life situations but is *not* considered insane and remains in touch with reality.

#### 2. ICD-10 Classification of Mental Disorders
The ICD-10 classifies mental and behavioural disorders into specific blocks:

1.  **Organic Mental Disorders (including symptomatic):** e.g., [[Dementia]] in Alzheimer's disease, Delirium.
2.  **Mental and behavioural disorders due to [[Psychoactive Substance Use]]:** e.g., Alcohol use disorder, Opioid dependence.
3.  **Schizophrenia, Schizotypal and Delusional disorders:** e.g., Paranoid schizophrenia.
4.  **Mood (Affective) disorders:** e.g., Bipolar affective disorder, Depressive episode.
5.  **Neurotic, Stress-related and Somatoform disorders:** e.g., Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Phobias.
6.  **Behavioural syndromes associated with physiological disturbances:** e.g., Eating disorders (Anorexia/Bulimia), Non-organic sleep disorders.
7.  **Disorders of Adult Personality and Behaviour:** e.g., Paranoid personality disorder, Trans-sexualism.
8.  **[[Mental Retardation]]:** Arrested or incomplete development of the mind.
9.  **Disorders of Psychological Development:** e.g., Childhood autism, Specific reading disorders.
10. **Behavioural and emotional disorders with onset in childhood/adolescence:** e.g., Hyperkinetic disorders (ADHD), Conduct disorders.

### Detailed Description of Major Categories

#### A. Organic Brain Disorders
These disorders have a demonstrable physical or physiological pathology.
*   **Acute Brain Disorders:** Result from temporary, reversible, diffuse impairment of brain tissue function.
    *   *Examples:* Acute alcoholic intoxication, Acute delirium.
*   **Chronic Brain Disorders:** Result from relatively permanent, irreversible diffuse impairment of cerebral tissue function.
    *   *Examples:* Senile [[dementia]], Cerebral syphilis.

#### B. Psychotic Disorders (Major Illnesses)
Characterized by varying degrees of personality disintegration and failure to correctly evaluate external reality.
1.  **[[Schizophrenia]] ("Split Personality"):** The patient lives in a dream world of their own. It is the most common condition for hospitalization (approx. 45-58% of admissions),.
2.  **Manic Depressive Psychosis (MDP) / Bipolar Disorder:** Symptoms vary from heights of excitement (Mania) to depths of depression.
3.  **Paranoia:** Associated with undue and extreme suspicion and a progressive tendency to regard the whole world in a framework of delusions.

#### C. Neurotic Disorders (Psychoneuroses)
These patients exhibit peculiar symptoms but do not present gross disorganization of personality or gross distortion of reality.
*   **Anxiety:** Overt or subconscious.
*   **Hysteria:** Conversion of psychological stress into physical symptoms.
*   **Obsessions and Compulsions:** Recurrent intrusive thoughts or actions.
*   **Phobias:** Morbid fears,.

#### D. Psychosomatic Disorders
Organic illnesses where psychological factors play a major etiological role.
*   *Examples:* Essential hypertension, Peptic ulcer, Bronchial asthma, Rheumatoid arthritis, Ulcerative colitis, Skin disorders (Eczema, Urticaria),.

#### E. Childhood Disorders
*   **Mental Retardation:** IQ below 70. Classified as Mild (50-69), Moderate (35-49), Severe (20-34), and Profound (<20),.
*   **Juvenile Delinquency:** Antisocial behavior in those under 18 years.
*   **Behavioural Disorders:** Bed-wetting, tantrums, stealing, lying, aggressiveness.

### Etiology and Risk Factors
Unlike infectious diseases with a specific agent, mental illness is multifactorial.

| Factor Category | Description and Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Organic Conditions** | Cerebral arteriosclerosis, Neoplasms, Metabolic diseases, Endocrine diseases, Epilepsy, Tuberculosis, Leprosy,. |
| **Heredity (Genetics)** | A child of two schizophrenic parents has a **40 times higher risk** of developing schizophrenia than a child of healthy parents. |
| **Social/Pathological** | Worries, anxieties, emotional stress, broken homes, poverty, industrialization, urbanization, cruelty, rejection. |
| **Environmental (Toxic)** | Lead compounds, Mercury, Manganese, Carbon disulfide, Psychotropic drugs (barbiturates, alcohol). |
| **Nutritional** | Deficiency of Thiamine (Vitamin B1) or Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6). |

> **Clinical Relevance:** **[[Suicide]]** is a major risk associated with mental disorders. Globally, among young adults aged 15-29 years, suicide is the second leading cause of death.

| **Insight** | Absent (Patient does not know they are ill) | Present (Patient knows they have a problem) |
| **Reality Testing** | Lost (Hallucinations/Delusions present) | Intact |
| **Personality** | Major disintegration | Partial or no disintegration |
| **Social Functioning**| Severely impaired | Mildly impaired |
| **Treatment** | Antipsychotics / Hospitalization often needed | Psychotherapy / Anxiolytics |
| **Example** | Schizophrenia | Anxiety, Phobia |
