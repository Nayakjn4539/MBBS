# Chance Fracture (Seatbelt Injury)

### Introduction and History
The **Chance fracture**, also known as a **Jack-knife fracture** or **Seatbelt fracture**, is a specific type of vertebral injury characterized by a horizontal splitting of the vertebra.
*   **Description:** It was first described by **GQ Chance** in 1948.
*   **Definition:** A flexion-distraction injury resulting in a horizontal avulsion fracture of the vertebral body and posterior arch.
*   **Region:** Most commonly affects the [[Thoracolumbar junction]] (T12-L2) or the mid-lumbar spine.

### Mechanism of Injury
This injury is classically associated with motor vehicle accidents involving a passenger wearing a **lap-only seatbelt** (without a shoulder harness).

1.  **Sudden Deceleration:** rapid stopping of the vehicle occurs.
2.  **Fulcrum Effect:** The lap belt acts as a fulcrum anterior to the vertebral column (specifically anterior to the [[Anterior Longitudinal Ligament]]).
3.  **Inertia:** The upper body is thrown violently forward (flexion).
4.  **Distraction:** Because the axis of rotation is anterior to the spine, the entire vertebral column (posterior elements and vertebral body) is subjected to strong tensile forces, pulling the vertebrae apart.

### Pathoanatomy and Classification
The injury involves the failure of all three columns (Anterior, Middle, and Posterior) under tension. It is, by definition, an **unstable injury**.

**Types of Chance Fracture:**
The tear passes transversely through the spine and can be classified into two main types:

| Type | Description | Stability/Healing Potential |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bony Chance** | The fracture line passes entirely through the bone (spinous process, lamina, pedicles, and vertebral body). | Generally heals well with immobilization because bone has good osteogenic potential. |
| **Soft Tissue (Ligamentous) Chance** | The disruption occurs through the soft tissues ([[Supraspinous ligament]], [[Interspinous ligament]], [[Ligamentum flavum]], joint capsules, and [[Intervertebral disc]]). | Highly unstable; poor healing potential without surgery. Higher risk of neurological injury. |

### Clinical Features
*   **History:** Significant history of a road traffic accident (high-speed deceleration) or fall from a height.
*   **Local Signs:**
    *   Back pain and tenderness over the affected level.
    *   Bruising over the abdominal wall (the **"Seatbelt Sign"**) corresponding to the location of the lap belt.
    *   A palpable gap between spinous processes (in severe ligamentous disruption).
    *   Kyphotic deformity (Gibbus) may be noted.
*   **Neurological Status:**
    *   Neurological damage is relatively **uncommon** compared to burst fractures because the spinal canal is not usually encroached upon by retropulsed bone; instead, the canal volume may actually increase due to distraction.
    *   However, paraplegia can occur if there is significant translation/dislocation.

### Clinical Implications: The "Seatbelt Syndrome"
**Important:** A patient presenting with a Chance fracture must be evaluated for **associated intra-abdominal injuries**. The same compression force that fractures the spine can compress abdominal viscera against the spine.
*   **Common Associations:** Rupture of the hollow viscera (bowel perforation), lacerations of the mesentery, or injury to solid organs (spleen/liver).
*   **Action:** General surgery consultation and abdominal CT are mandatory.

### Imaging
**1. Plain X-rays (AP and Lateral)**
*   **Lateral View:**
    *   Horizontal fracture line extending from the posterior elements (spinous process/pedicles) through the vertebral body.
    *   Increased interspinous distance (fanning of spinous processes).
    *   Little or no wedging (compression) of the anterior vertebral body.
*   **AP View:**
    *   **Empty Vertebra Sign:** Due to the horizontal split and distraction.
    *   Fracture through the [[Pedicles]].

**2. CT Scan**
*   Better defines the bony architecture and extent of the fracture through the pedicles.
*   Crucial for ruling out retropulsion fragments.

**3. MRI**
*   Essential to evaluate the **Posterior Ligamentous Complex (PLC)**.
*   Assesses the spinal cord and [[Intervertebral disc]] status.
*   Differentiates between bony and purely ligamentous injuries.

### Treatment
The goal is to restore stability and alignment.

#### 1. Conservative Management
*   **Indications:**
    *   **Bony Chance fractures** (Osseous type).
    *   Neurologically intact patients.
    *   Less than 15° of kyphosis.
*   **Method:** Hyperextension body cast or a rigid [[Thoracolumbar Orthosis]] (TLSO) / Jewel brace.
*   **Duration:** Typically for 3 months to allow bony union.

#### 2. Surgical Management
*   **Indications:**
    *   **Ligamentous Chance fractures** (soft tissue healing is unpredictable).
    *   Polytrauma patients (for ease of nursing and rehabilitation).
    *   Significant kyphotic deformity.
    *   Neurological deficit.
    *   Obesity (casts are poorly tolerated).
*   **Procedure:** Posterior stabilization using **pedicle screws and rods** to compress the posterior elements and close the distraction gap. Fusion is performed across the injured segment.
