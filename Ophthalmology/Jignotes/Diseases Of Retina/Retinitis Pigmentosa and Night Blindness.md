# Retinitis Pigmentosa and Night Blindness

## Night Blindness (Nyctalopia)

**Definition:**
[[Night blindness]] or [[Nyctalopia]] is the inability to see well in dim light or at night. It primarily indicates dysfunction of the [[Rods]] (photoreceptors responsible for scotopic vision) or physical obstruction of light in dim conditions.

### Causes of Night Blindness
A mnemonic to remember the causes: **"Very High Rates Of Glaucoma Cause Night Blindness"**

*   **V** - [[Vitamin A Deficiency]] ([[Xerophthalmia]]): Causes defective regeneration of [[Rhodopsin]].
*   **H** - High [[Myopia]] (Pathological).
*   **R** - [[Retinitis Pigmentosa]] (and other tapetoretinal degenerations).
*   **O** - [[Oguchi's Disease]].
*   **G** - [[Glaucoma]] (Advanced [[Primary Open Angle Glaucoma]]).
*   **C** - [[Congenital Stationary Night Blindness]] (CSNB).
*   **N** - [[Nutritional Amblyopia]].
*   **B** - [[Bassen-Kornzweig Syndrome]] (Abetalipoproteinemia).

### Physiological Distinction
*   **Nyctalopia:** Defective vision in dim light (Rod dysfunction).
*   **Hemeralopia:** Defective vision in bright light/Day blindness (Cone dysfunction, e.g., [[Cone Dystrophy]], Central [[Cataract]], [[Corneal Opacity]]).

## Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP)

### Overview
[[Retinitis Pigmentosa]] is a group of hereditary disorders characterized by progressive dystrophy of the photoreceptors (specifically the rods and cones) and the [[Retinal Pigment Epithelium]] (RPE).
*   **Pathology:** It is primarily a **Rod-Cone Dystrophy**. Rods are affected first (causing night blindness), followed by degeneration of cones.
*   **Epidemiology:** Occurs in 1 in 5,000 people. Males are affected more than females (3:2). It typically begins in childhood and progresses to blindness by advanced middle age.

### Genetics and Inheritance
RP can be sporadic or inherited. The mode of inheritance significantly dictates the prognosis.

| Inheritance Pattern | Frequency | Prognosis | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sporadic** | Most Common (40-50%) | Variable | Isolated cases without family history. |
| **Autosomal Dominant (AD)** | Common (15-25%) | **Best Prognosis** | Least severe; retained central vision till 6th decade. |
| **Autosomal Recessive (AR)** | Less Common (5-20%) | Intermediate | Intermediate severity. |
| **X-Linked Recessive (XLR)** | Least Common (5-15%) | **Worst Prognosis** | Most severe; blindness by 3rd or 4th decade. Female carriers show "Tapetal Reflex" (golden reflex) at the macula. |

### Pathogenesis
1.  **Apoptosis:** Genetic mutations lead to apoptosis (programmed cell death) of [[Rod Photoreceptors]].
2.  **Cumulative Damage:** As rods die, the metabolic demand on the remaining cells increases, eventually leading to the death of [[Cone Photoreceptors]].
3.  **Pigment Migration:** Degeneration of the neuroepithelium allows pigment from the RPE to migrate into the retina, particularly around blood vessels (perivascular), forming the characteristic "bone spicules".

### Clinical Features

#### Symptoms
*   **Nyctalopia (Night Blindness):** The earliest and most characteristic symptom, often preceding visible fundus changes by years.
*   **Visual Field Loss:** Progressive constriction. Starts as a mid-peripheral scotoma and advances to a **Ring Scotoma**, eventually leaving only a small island of central vision known as **Tubular Vision** or **Tunnel Vision**.
*   **Decreased Visual Acuity:** Usually preserved until late stages, but can be reduced early due to [[Cystoid Macular Edema]] (CME) or [[Posterior Subcapsular Cataract]] (PSC).
*   **Photopsia:** Subjective flashes of light.

#### Signs (The Classic Triad)
Diagnosis is often based on the presence of these three classic fundus findings:

1.  **Arteriolar Attenuation:** Narrowing of retinal blood vessels.
2.  **Bony Spicule Pigmentation:** Jet-black, arachnoid-shaped pigment deposits found initially in the **mid-periphery** and perivascular spaces.
3.  **Waxy Pale Optic Disc:** Due to consecutive [[Optic Atrophy]].

### Ocular Associations
Patients with RP frequently develop secondary ocular complications:
*   **Cataract:** Specifically [[Posterior Subcapsular Cataract]] (PSC).
*   **Maculopathy:** [[Cystoid Macular Edema]] (CME), Epiretinal membrane, or Macular atrophy.
*   **Refractive Error:** [[Myopia]] is common.
*   **Glaucoma:** [[Primary Open Angle Glaucoma]] (POAG).
*   **Vitreous Changes:** Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) and vitreous opacities.
*   **Optic Disc Drusen**.

### Systemic Associations (Syndromic RP)
Approximately 25% of RP cases are associated with systemic diseases.

| Syndrome | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Usher's Syndrome]]** | RP + Sensorineural **Deafness** (Most common systemic association). |
| **[[Laurence-Moon-Biedl Syndrome]]** | RP + Obesity + Polydactyly + Hypogonadism + Mental retardation. |
| **[[Refsum's Disease]]** | RP + Peripheral neuropathy + Cerebellar ataxia + Phytanic acid metabolism defect. |
| **[[Bassen-Kornzweig Syndrome]]** | RP + Abetalipoproteinemia + Acanthocytosis (star-shaped RBCs) + Ataxia. |
| **[[Kearns-Sayre Syndrome]]** | RP + Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) + Heart block (Cardiac conduction defects). |
| **[[Cockayne's Syndrome]]** | RP + Dwarfism + Progressive infantile deafness. |

### Atypical Forms of Retinitis Pigmentosa
*   **Retinitis Pigmentosa Sine Pigmento:** All clinical features of RP (night blindness, field loss, ERG changes) are present **without** visible pigmentary changes on fundoscopy.
*   **Sector RP:** Degeneration is confined to one sector of the retina (usually inferior nasal).
*   **Pericentric RP:** Pigmentary changes are confined to the area immediately around the macula.
*   **Retinitis Punctata Albescens:** Numerous discrete white dots scattered over the fundus instead of bone spicules; associated with night blindness and narrowed arterioles.
*   **Inverse RP:** Pigmentation occurs at the posterior pole (macula) rather than the periphery; central vision is lost early.
*   **Leber's Congenital Amaurosis:** Severe form causing blindness at birth or early infancy; unrecordable ERG; "Salt and pepper" fundus.

### Investigations
*   **[[Electroretinography]] (ERG):** **Gold Standard** for diagnosis.
    *   Shows subnormal or **extinguished** (non-recordable) response.
    *   Scotopic (rod) response is affected before photopic (cone) response.
    *   Changes appear *before* subjective symptoms or visible fundus signs.
*   **[[Electro-oculography]] (EOG):** Absent light peak; Arden's ratio is decreased.
*   **Visual Fields (Perimetry):**
    *   Early: Mid-peripheral scotoma / Ring scotoma.
    *   Late: Tubular vision (Tunnel vision).
*   **Dark Adaptometry:** Delayed dark adaptation threshold.
*   **Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT):** To detect Cystoid Macular Edema (CME).

### Differential Diagnosis
1.  **Congenital Syphilis:** Can cause a "Salt and pepper" fundus and secondary retinal degeneration mimicking RP.
2.  **Vitamin A Deficiency:** Causes night blindness but reversible with treatment.
3.  **Congenital Stationary Night Blindness (CSNB):** Non-progressive night blindness from birth; normal fundus or specific changes (e.g., Oguchi's disease).
4.  **Phenothiazine Toxicity:** Can cause pigmentary retinopathy (e.g., Thioridazine).

### Management
There is currently **no cure** for RP. Management is supportive and aimed at slowing progression and managing complications.

**1. General Measures:**
*   **Genetic Counseling:** Crucial due to hereditary nature.
*   **Low Vision Aids (LVA):** Magnifying glasses, night vision devices (image intensifiers).
*   **Sun Protection:** Dark glasses to prevent phototoxicity.

**2. Medical Management:**
*   **[[Vitamin A]]:** Oral Vitamin A palmitate (15,000 IU/day) may slow the decline of ERG amplitude (controversial).
*   **Acetazolamide:** Oral or topical Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors for treating [[Cystoid Macular Edema]].
*   **Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA):** Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation.

**3. Surgical/Interventional Management:**
*   **Cataract Surgery:** For significant Posterior Subcapsular Cataract (visual prognosis depends on macular status).
*   **Retinal Prosthesis:** **[[Argus II]]** (Epiretinal implant) or Subretinal implants (e.g., Alpha IMS). Used for patients with severe/profound vision loss (bare light perception) to induce some visual perception.
*   **Gene Therapy:** Voretigene neparvovec (Luxturna) is FDA approved for biallelic **RPE65** mutation-associated retinal dystrophy.
