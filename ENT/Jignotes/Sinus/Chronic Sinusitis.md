# Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS)

### Definition
**Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS)** is defined as the inflammation of the nose and [[paranasal sinuses]] characterized by symptoms persisting for at least **12 weeks** without complete resolution,,. 
*   **Current Terminology:** The term "Rhinosinusitis" is preferred over "Sinusitis" because inflammation of the sinuses rarely occurs without concurrent inflammation of the nasal mucosa,.

### Classification
CRS is clinically divided based on the presence of polyps:
1.  **Chronic Rhinosinusitis without Nasal Polyps (CRSsNP):** Usually bacterial in origin or due to progression of acute/subacute rhinosinusitis.
2.  **Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps (CRSwNP):** Associated with systemic disorders, aspirin sensitivity, or allergy,.

### Etiology and Predisposing Factors
The etiology is multifactorial, involving an interaction between the host, environment, and microbes.

**1. Systemic/Host Factors:**
*   **Allergy:** Causes mucosal edema and ostial obstruction.
*   **Asthma:** Highly associated; nearly 50% of CRS patients have asthma.
*   **Ciliary Dysfunction:** [[Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia]], [[Kartagener’s Syndrome]], and [[Cystic Fibrosis]] lead to stasis of secretions,.
*   **Immunodeficiency:** IgA or IgG deficiency, HIV.
*   **Genetic Factors:** Abnormalities in mucus composition (e.g., Cystic Fibrosis).
*   **Samter’s Triad:** [[Nasal Polyps]] + Asthma + Aspirin Hypersensitivity.

**2. Local/Anatomical Factors:**
*   **Osteomeatal Complex (OMC) Obstruction:** Key factor in pathogenesis.
*   **Deviated Nasal Septum (DNS):** Causes mechanical obstruction.
*   **Anatomical Variations:** [[Concha Bullosa]], paradoxical middle turbinate, Haller cells,.
*   **Dental Infection:** Apical abscess of upper premolars/molars can spread to the [[Maxillary Sinus]].

**3. Microbiology:**
*   **Biofilms:** Aggregations of bacteria (e.g., *S. aureus*, *Pseudomonas*) resistant to antibiotics.
*   **Bacteria:** *Staphylococcus aureus* (most common), *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, *Klebsiella*, and anaerobes. Bacteriology differs from acute sinusitis.
*   **Fungi:** *Aspergillus*, *Alternaria*.

### Pathophysiology
The central mechanism is the obstruction of the **sinus ostia**.

> Flowchart showing the Cycle of Sinusitis: Ostial Obstruction -> Stasis of Secretions -> Hypoxia/Acidosis -> Ciliary Dysfunction -> Bacterial Proliferation -> Mucosal Inflammation -> Further Obstruction

1.  **Obstruction:** Blockage of the [[Osteomeatal Complex]] (OMC).
2.  **Stasis:** Impaired ventilation and drainage lead to secretion retention.
3.  **Inflammation:** Hypoxia causes ciliary damage and mucosal edema.
4.  **Infection:** Stasis allows bacterial colonization (Biofilms), perpetuating inflammation.

### Clinical Features
Symptoms must persist for **>12 weeks**.

**Major Symptoms (Diagnostic)**,:
*   **Nasal Obstruction/Blockage/Congestion**
*   **Nasal Discharge:** Anterior (rhinorrhea) or Posterior (post-nasal drip); usually mucopurulent/discolored.
*   **Facial Pain/Pressure:** Often described as fullness; less severe than in acute sinusitis.
*   **Hyposmia/Anosmia:** Decreased sense of smell.

**Minor Symptoms**:
*   Headache
*   Fever (usually low grade)
*   Halitosis (bad breath)
*   Fatigue
*   Dental pain
*   Cough (worse at night in children)
*   Ear pain/pressure

**Clinical Implications:**
> **Facial pain** alone, without nasal symptoms, is rarely due to sinusitis. It is often due to tension headache or migraine.

### Diagnosis
Diagnosis requires **two or more symptoms** (one of which must be blockage or discharge) **PLUS** objective evidence of disease.

#### 1. Nasal Endoscopy
*   **Findings:** Mucosal edema, mucopurulent discharge (primarily from middle meatus), or nasal polyps.
*   **Utility:** Allows visualization of the OMC and collection of pus for culture.

#### 2. Imaging
*   **CT Scan (Non-Contrast):** The **Gold Standard** for CRS.
    *   **Findings:** Mucosal thickening, sinus opacification, air-fluid levels, bony sclerosis, and anatomical blockage of the OMC,.
    *   **Lund-Mackay Score:** Used to quantify the extent of disease.
*   **X-Ray:** *Plain sinus X-rays are of little value* in CRS due to poor sensitivity,.

#### 3. Microbiology
*   Endoscopically guided swab from the middle meatus is preferred over nasal swabs.

### Treatment

#### A. Medical Management
The primary goal is to reduce inflammation and restore drainage.
1.  **Nasal Saline Irrigation:** Washes away crusts, secretions, and allergens; improves mucociliary clearance.
2.  **Intranasal Corticosteroids:** (e.g., Mometasone, Fluticasone). Mainstay therapy to reduce mucosal edema and inflammation.
3.  **Systemic Steroids:** Short courses (e.g., Prednisolone) used for extensive polyposis to reduce size ("medical polypectomy").
4.  **Antibiotics:**
    *   **Short-term:** For acute exacerbations.
    *   **Long-term (Macrolides):** Low dose Clarithromycin/Roxithromycin for 12 weeks. Acts as an anti-inflammatory and immunomodulator rather than just antibacterial.
5.  **Antihistamines/Leukotriene Antagonists:** If an allergic component is present.

#### B. Surgical Management
Indicated when medical therapy fails or complications arise.
*   **Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery ([[FESS]]):** The standard surgical approach.
    *   **Principle:** Restore physiological drainage by clearing disease from the **Osteomeatal Complex** while preserving normal mucosa,.
    *   **Basic Steps:**
        1.  **Uncinectomy:** Removal of uncinate process.
        2.  **Middle Meatal Antrostomy:** Widening the maxillary ostium.
        3.  **Anterior Ethmoidectomy:** Clearance of ethmoid cells.
        4.  **Frontal Recess Clearance:** If frontal sinus is involved.
*   **Older Procedures (Rarely done now):**
    *   **Caldwell-Luc Operation:** For irreversible mucosal changes or biopsy.
    *   **Antral Lavage (Proof Puncture):** Diagnostic and therapeutic for washing out pus.

### Specific Variations

#### 1. Fungal Sinusitis
*   **Fungal Ball:** Non-invasive. Hyperdense mass on CT (calcifications). Treatment: Surgical removal.
*   **Allergic Fungal Rhinosinusitis (AFRS):** Type 1 hypersensitivity to fungi.
    *   **Features:** Nasal polyps, thick **eosinophilic mucin** ("peanut butter" consistency), **Double Density sign** on CT.
    *   **Diagnosis:** Bent and Kuhn Criteria.
    *   **Treatment:** Surgery + Steroids.
*   **Invasive Fungal Sinusitis:** See in immunocompromised (e.g., Mucormycosis). Presents with black necrotic eschar. **Medical Emergency** requiring debridement and Amphotericin B.

#### 2. Pediatric Chronic Sinusitis
*   Often related to **Adenoid Hypertrophy** (acts as a bacterial reservoir).
*   **Treatment:** Adenoidectomy is often the first-line surgical intervention before sinus surgery.

### Complications
Spread of infection due to bone erosion or thrombophlebitis.
