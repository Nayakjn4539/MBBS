# [[Legal Procedures]] > Dying Declaration and Dying Deposition

### Dying Declaration

**Definition**
A [[Dying Declaration]] is a written or oral statement made by a person, who is dead (or dying), regarding the **cause of their death** or any of the **circumstances of the transaction** which resulted in their death.

**Legal Basis**
*   **Section:** Admissible in court under **[[Section 32 of Indian Evidence Act]] (IEA)**.
*   **Underlying Principle:** *Nemo moriturus praesumitur mentire* – "A man will not meet his maker with a lie in his mouth." The law presumes that the proximity of death creates a solemn obligation to speak the truth, equivalent to the sanction of an oath.

**Who Can Record It?**
1.  **[[Executive Magistrate]]**: This is the ideal and most valuable method.
2.  **Doctor**: If the patient's condition is serious and there is no time to call a Magistrate.
3.  **Police Officer**: Can record it if no one else is available, but it holds less evidentiary value.
4.  **Village Headman/Private Person**: Can record in the presence of witnesses if no official is available.

**Prerequisites for Recording**
1.  **[[Compos Mentis]]**: The victim must be in a sound state of mind, conscious, and oriented to time, place, and person. The doctor must certify this *before* and *after* recording the statement.
2.  **No Oath**: An oath is **not** administered to the dying person.
3.  **Expectation of Death**:
    *   **Indian Law:** It is **not mandatory** for the person to be under the expectation of imminent death for the declaration to be valid.
    *   **English Law:** The person *must* be in a settled, hopeless expectation of death.

**Procedure for Recording**
*   **Preliminary Steps**: The doctor must examine the patient (pulse, BP, consciousness) and certify mental fitness in the case sheet/docket.
*   **Questioning**:
    *   Avoid **[[Leading Questions]]** (questions that suggest the answer, e.g., "Did X stab you?").
    *   Ask simple questions (e.g., "What happened to you?").
*   **Language**: It should be recorded in the **victim's own words** (verbatim) and in the language they speak. No translation or interpretation should be done during recording.
*   **Completion**:
    *   Read the statement back to the patient.
    *   Obtain the **Signature** or **Left Thumb Impression** (LTI) of the patient.
    *   The recorder (Doctor/Magistrate) and two witnesses must sign it.
*   **If Patient becomes Unconscious**: The recorder must stop immediately, note the time, and sign stating the patient became unconscious.
*   **Verbal/Gestural Statement**: If the victim cannot speak (e.g., cut throat), they may answer by signs/gestures. This is recorded as a "Verbal Statement" and is admissible.

### Dying Deposition

**Definition**
A [[Dying Deposition]] is a statement made by a witness (the dying person) under **oath**, recorded by a **Magistrate**, in the **presence of the accused** (or their lawyer), who is given an opportunity to **cross-examine** the witness.

**Key Features**
*   **Legal Basis**: While not explicitly termed "Dying Deposition" in the Indian Evidence Act, it refers to the formal recording of evidence under judicial procedures.
*   **Oath**: It is mandatory to administer an oath.
*   **Cross-Examination**: This is the defining feature. The defense gets to question the victim immediately.
*   **Superiority**: It carries higher evidentiary value than a Dying Declaration because the truthfulness has been tested via cross-examination.
*   **Current Practice**: It is **rarely practiced in India** due to procedural delays and logistical difficulties in arranging the accused and magistrate immediately at the bedside.

### Comparison: Dying Declaration vs. Dying Deposition

| Feature | Dying Declaration (DD) | Dying Deposition (DDep) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Recorded By** | Magistrate, Doctor, Police, or any person. | Only by a **Magistrate**. |
| **Oath** | **Not administered**. | **Administered**. |
| **Presence of Accused** | Not required. | **Mandatory**. |
| **Cross-Examination** | Not done. | **Done** by defense lawyer. |
| **Leading Questions** | Not allowed. | Allowed during cross-examination. |
| **Legal Value** | Inferior to deposition (Hearsay exception). | **Superior** (Judicial evidence). |
| **If Patient Survives** | Becomes **corroborative evidence** (not substantive). Used under Sec 157 IEA. | Remains **valid** and admissible as substantive evidence. |
| **Status in India** | Most common method. | Rarely used. |

### Role of the Doctor

1.  **Primary Duty**: Medical treatment (saving life) takes precedence over legal formalities.
2.  **Intimation**: Inform the police immediately if a patient with serious injuries (likely to die) arrives.
3.  **Certification**:
    *   If a Magistrate is recording: The doctor acts as a witness to certify the patient is **[[Compos Mentis]]** throughout the process.
    *   If the patient's condition deteriorates, the doctor informs the Magistrate to stop.
4.  **Recorder**: If death is imminent and the Magistrate hasn't arrived, the doctor **must** record the declaration to prevent the loss of evidence.
5.  **Chain of Custody**: Preserve the written declaration in a sealed envelope and hand it over to the Investigating Officer or Magistrate.

### Mnemonics

**Requisites of Dying Declaration: "S O U N D"**
*   **S** - **Statement** (Written/Oral/Gestures).
*   **O** - **Own words** (Verbatim, native language).
*   **U** - **Uninfluenced** (No tutoring or leading questions).
*   **N** - **No Oath** necessary.
*   **D** - **Doctor's certification** of fitness (Compos Mentis).

### Medicolegal Aspects

*   **Admissibility**: A DD is admissible in both civil and criminal cases in India.
*   **Falsity**: If a part of the DD is found to be false, the court may reject the whole declaration (falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus), though Indian courts often attempt to separate the grain from the chaff.
*   **Laryngeal Injuries**: In cases of cut throat or laryngeal edema, the doctor must specifically document *how* the patient communicated (writing/gestures) to validate the declaration.
*   **Thumb Impression**: If the patient has burns on hands, a toe impression can be taken, or a witness can attest to the inability to sign.
