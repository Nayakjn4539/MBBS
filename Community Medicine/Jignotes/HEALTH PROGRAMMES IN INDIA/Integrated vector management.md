# [[HEALTH PROGRAMMES IN INDIA]] > Integrated vector management

### Integrated Vector Management (IVM)

**Definition**
[[Integrated Vector Management (IVM)]] is a rational decision-making process for the optimal use of resources for vector control. It is not a single method but a **comprehensive strategy** that combines various interventions to improve efficacy, cost-effectiveness, ecological soundness, and sustainability of disease control.

The goal is to reduce or interrupt transmission of vector-borne diseases while reducing reliance on any single method (especially chemical insecticides).

### Core Components of IVM
The strategy is built on a multi-pronged approach, moving away from a "one-size-fits-all" vertical program to a flexible, local situation-specific response.

#### 1. Environmental Management ([[Source Reduction]])
This is the **most effective long-term measure** as it produces permanent results.
*   **Minor Engineering Measures:** Filling and leveling of ditches, drainage of stagnant water.
*   **Water Management:** Intermittent irrigation (to interrupt the life cycle), sluicing, and changing water salinity.
*   **Urban Sanitation:** Proper solid waste disposal, covering overhead tanks, and closing cesspools to control *Aedes* and *Culex* breeding.

#### 2. Chemical Control
Used judiciously to minimize environmental contamination and [[Insecticide Resistance]].
*   **Anti-Adult Measures:**
    *   **[[Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS)]]:** Using DDT, Malathion, or Synthetic Pyrethroids in high-risk areas (API > 2).
    *   **Space Spraying:** Fogging (thermal or cold) used primarily during **epidemics** for rapid knockdown of adult mosquitoes.
*   **Anti-Larval Measures:**
    *   **Chemical Larvicides:** Use of Temephos (Abate) in potable water; Fenthion in polluted water.
    *   **Mineral Oils:** Mosquito Larvicidal Oil (MLO) creates a film on water causing asphyxiation of larvae.

#### 3. Biological Control
*   **Larvivorous Fish:** Introduction of *[[Gambusia affinis]]* and *Poecilia reticulata* (Guppy) in water bodies.
*   **Biocides:** Use of *Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis* (Bti) and *Bacillus sphaericus* (biolarvicides).

#### 4. Personal Protection
*   **[[Insecticide Treated Bed Nets (ITBN)]]:** Nets treated with synthetic pyrethroids (deltamethrin, cyfluthrin).
*   **[[Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs)]]:** Factory-treated nets that remain effective for several years without re-treatment.
*   **Repellents:** DEET, mosquito coils, protective clothing.

#### 5. Legislative Measures
*   Enforcement of civic by-laws to prevent mosquitogenic conditions (e.g., in building construction sites).

### Comparison of Vector Control Methods

| Method | Focus | Examples | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Environmental** | Source Reduction | Draining swamps, filling pits | Permanent, eco-friendly | High initial cost, labor intensive |
| **Chemical** | Immediate Killing | DDT, Malathion, Fogging | Rapid action, epidemic control | Resistance, environmental pollution |
| **Biological** | Natural Enemies | *Gambusia* fish, Biolarvicides | No pollution, low maintenance | Specific to water bodies, slow action |
| **Genetic** | Altering Reproduction | Sterile male technique | Species-specific | Research phase, technically complex |

### Implementation under NVBDCP in India
The [[National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP)]] implements IVM for six diseases (Malaria, Dengue, Chikungunya, JE, Kala-azar, Filariasis).

**Key Strategies:**
1.  **Selection based on Epidemiology:**
    *   **Rural areas:** IRS is the primary method.
    *   **Urban areas:** Anti-larval measures (chemicals/fish) are primary; IRS is rarely used.
2.  **Synergy:** Using identical vector control methods to control multiple diseases simultaneously (e.g., IRS in rural areas controls both Malaria and [[Kala-azar]]).
3.  **Rotation of Insecticides:** Changing the class of insecticide used for IRS to delay the development of resistance.
4.  **Inter-sectoral Coordination:** Collaboration with agriculture, urban development, and water resources departments.

### Mnemonic
To remember the components of Integrated Vector Management: **"BASIC"**

*   **B** - **B**iological control (Fish, Bacteria)
*   **A** - **A**nti-adult/Anti-larval chemicals (IRS, Fogging)
*   **S** - **S**ource reduction (Environmental management)
*   **I** - **I**ntegrated approach (Combining methods)
*   **C** - **C**ommunity participation & Personal protection

---

### Clinical & Public Health Relevance
*   **Prevention of Outbreaks:** IVM is crucial for preventing epidemics of Dengue and Chikungunya where no specific treatment exists.
*   **Managing Resistance:** Reliance solely on chemical sprays has led to widespread resistance in vectors (*Anopheles* and *Aedes*); IVM mitigates this.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** While initial setup for environmental changes is high, the long-term morbidity reduction makes IVM highly cost-effective for the health system.
