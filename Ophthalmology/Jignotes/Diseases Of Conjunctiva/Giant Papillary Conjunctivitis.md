# Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis (GPC)

**Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis (GPC)**, also known as **[[mechanically-induced papillary conjunctivitis]]**, is a specific type of allergic inflammation affecting the **[[superior tarsal conjunctiva]]**. It is characterized by the formation of very large-sized papillae, historically defined as greater than 1 mm, though currently, papillae greater than 0.3 mm are often included in the definition.

### Etiology
GPC is essentially a localized allergic response to a physically rough or deposited surface.

| Cause | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Contact lenses]]** | Most commonly associated with soft hydrophilic contact lenses. Can also occur with rigid gas permeable lenses after many years of use. |
| **[[Ocular prosthesis]]** | Mechanical irritation from an ill-fitting or rough artificial eye. |
| **Sutures** | Protruding suture ends (e.g., nylon sutures) following ocular surgery. |
| **[[Scleral buckle]]** | Rarely, due to extruded scleral buckling material used in retinal detachment surgery. |

### Pathogenesis
The exact mechanism involves a combination of two factors:
1.  **Mechanical Trauma:** Constant rubbing of the **[[palpebral conjunctiva]]** against a foreign body.
2.  **Immune Response:** A hypersensitivity reaction to antigens present in surface deposits (e.g., proteins on contact lenses) or environmental factors.
    *   **Hypersensitivity Type:** It involves both **[[Type I hypersensitivity]]** (IgE-mediated) and **[[Type IV hypersensitivity]]** (delayed cellular) reactions.
    *   **Mechanism:** Antigens are processed by M cells in the **[[conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissue (CALT)]]** and presented to B lymphocytes to mediate the immune response.

### Clinical Features

#### Symptoms
*   **Itching:** Mild to moderate.
*   **Discharge:** Stringy or ropy mucus discharge.
*   **Intolerance:** Reduced wearing time of contact lenses or prosthetic shells.
*   **Blurring of vision:** Due to deposits on the lens or mucous discharge.
*   **Foreign body sensation**.

#### Signs
*   **Papillary Hypertrophy:** The hallmark sign is the presence of large polygonal papillae on the **[[superior tarsal conjunctiva]]**.
    *   **Macropapillae:** 0.3–1.0 mm in diameter.
    *   **Giant Papillae:** > 1.0 mm in diameter.
*   **Hyperemia:** Congestion of the upper palpebral conjunctiva.
*   **Appearance:** Resembles the palpebral form of **[[Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis]] (VKC)**.

### Management

#### 1. Removal of Offending Agent (Primary Treatment)
*   **Contact Lenses:** Discontinuation of soft contact lenses is often necessary. Refitting with a new lens, changing lens material, or switching to daily disposables to reduce protein buildup can help.
*   **Sutures:** Removal of protruding or irritating sutures.
*   **Prosthesis:** Cleaning and polishing the **[[ocular prosthesis]]** or coating it with biocompatible material.

#### 2. Pharmacological Therapy
*   **[[Mast cell stabilizers]]**: Agents like **[[sodium cromoglycate]]**, **[[lodoxamide]]**, or **[[nedocromil]]** help relieve symptoms and enhance resolution.
*   **Combined Agents:** Dual-action drugs like **[[olopatadine]]** (antihistamine + mast cell stabilizer) are very effective.
*   **[[Artificial tears]]**: To flush out allergens and improve lubrication.
*   **Topical Steroids:** In severe or resistant cases, a short course of topical steroids or a **[[subtarsal injection]]** of long-acting steroid may be required.

**Clinical Implication:** In any patient complaining of reduced contact lens tolerance or itching after cataract surgery, always evert the upper lid to rule out GPC caused by lenses or sutures.
