# [[Strabismus (Squint)]] > Amblyopia

### Amblyopia (Lazy Eye)

**Definition**
[[Amblyopia]] is defined as a unilateral or bilateral subnormal visual acuity (usually less than 6/9 or a difference of two lines or more between the two eyes) for which no obvious organic cause can be detected by physical examination of the eye.
*   It results from abnormal visual experience during the **critical period** of visual development (birth to 7–8 years).
*   It is a developmental defect of spatial visual processing occurring in the central visual pathways.
*   **Pathophysiology:** Involves cell shrinkage in the parvocellular layers of the [[Lateral Geniculate Body]] (LGB) and loss of binocular cortical connections.

**Classification of Amblyopia**

Amblyopia is classified based on the underlying etiology causing the abnormal visual experience.

| Type | Etiology/Mechanism | Clinical Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Strabismic Amblyopia]]** | Results from **[[Strabismus]]** (Squint). The brain actively suppresses the image from the deviating eye to avoid **diplopia** and **confusion**. | • Most common cause.<br>• Occurs in constant, unilateral squints.<br>• Usually unilateral.<br>• Demonstrates the best response to treatment. |
| **[[Anisometropic Amblyopia]]** | Caused by a difference in refractive error between the two eyes ([[Anisometropia]]). The eye with the higher error is blurred and suppressed. | • More common in **Hypermetropes** (difference >1.5-2.5 D) than Myopes (difference >3-6.5 D).<br>• Often detected late as there is no visible deformity. |
| **[[Stimulus Deprivation Amblyopia]]** | Formerly *Amblyopia ex anopsia*. Caused by obstruction of the visual axis preventing light from reaching the retina. | • Causes: **[[Congenital Cataract]]**, severe **[[Ptosis]]**, corneal opacity, prolonged uncontrolled occlusion.<br>• Most severe form; difficult to treat if not managed very early. |
| **Isoametropic Amblyopia** | Bilateral amblyopia caused by high uncorrected refractive error in both eyes. | • High Hypermetropia (>+5D) or High Myopia (>-8D).<br>• Mechanisms involve blurred images in both eyes. |
| **Meridional Amblyopia** | Caused by uncorrected high **[[Astigmatism]]**. | • Selective amblyopia for a specific visual meridian. |

**Clinical Characteristics**

1.  **Reduced Visual Acuity:** Recognition acuity (Snellen) is more affected than resolution acuity (gratings).
2.  **[[Crowding Phenomenon]]:** Visual acuity is better when reading single isolated letters (optotypes) compared to reading a line of letters. The surrounding contours interfere with the resolution of the central letter.
3.  **Neutral Density Filter Effect:**
    *   **Amblyopic Eye:** Visual acuity remains the same or improves slightly when viewed through a neutral density filter.
    *   **Organic Disease:** Visual acuity typically drops significantly.
4.  **Fixation Pattern:** May have **[[Eccentric Fixation]]** (monocular fixation using a non-foveal retinal point) rather than central foveal fixation.
5.  **Contrast Sensitivity:** Decreased, especially at high spatial frequencies.
6.  **Binocular Function:** Loss of stereopsis and fusion.

**Grading of Amblyopia**
*   **Mild:** Visual acuity 20/25 to 20/60.
*   **Moderate:** Visual acuity 20/70 to 20/100.
*   **Severe:** Visual acuity 20/200 or worse.

**Diagnosis**
*   **Visual Acuity Test:** Difference of 2 lines or more between eyes.
*   **Refraction:** Cycloplegic refraction is mandatory to rule out refractive errors.
*   **Cover Test:** To detect strabismus.
*   **Ophthalmoscopy:** To rule out organic causes (e.g., macular scar, optic atrophy).
*   **Fixation Assessment:** Using a Visuoscope to check for eccentric fixation.

**Management**

Treatment is most effective if initiated early (during the sensitive period, preferably before 6–7 years).

**1. Removal of Obstacle (Optical/Surgical Correction)**
*   **Refractive Error:** Prescription of full cycloplegic refraction spectacles. This alone may cure anisometropic or isoametropic amblyopia.
*   **Media Opacity:** Surgical removal of [[Congenital Cataract]] or correction of [[Ptosis]] (if blocking the pupil) must be done immediately to clear the visual axis.

**2. [[Occlusion Therapy]] (Patching)**
*   **Principle:** Occluding the *sound* (normal) eye to force the brain to use the amblyopic eye.
*   **Methods:** Adhesive patch on skin (most effective), opaque contact lens, or patch on glasses.
*   **Regimen:**
    *   **Full-time Occlusion:** Occluding for all waking hours.
    *   **Part-time Occlusion:** Occluding for 2–6 hours/day (found to be equally effective in many cases).
*   **Dosage Schedule (Prevention of Occlusion Amblyopia):** To prevent amblyopia in the sound eye, the ratio of occlusion days (Sound eye : Amblyopic eye) is based on the child's age.
    *   **Formula:** Patch normal eye for **X days** and patch deviated eye for **1 day** (where X = Age of child in years).
    *   *Example:* A 4-year-old child undergoes 4 days of patching the normal eye followed by 1 day of patching the amblyopic eye (4:1 ratio).
*   **Duration:** Continued until vision equalizes or shows no further improvement for 3 months. **Maintenance occlusion** (part-time) is continued until the end of the amblyogenic age (approx. 8 years).

**3. Penalization**
*   Blurring the vision of the sound eye to compel the use of the amblyopic eye.
*   **Pharmacological ([[Atropine Penalization]]):** Instilling 1% Atropine drops in the sound eye (causing cycloplegia and blur). Useful for mild to moderate amblyopia or uncooperative children.
*   **Optical Penalization:** Prescribing over-plus lenses for the sound eye.

**4. Active Vision Therapy (Orthoptics)**
*   **CAM Stimulator:** Uses high-contrast square wave gratings of different spatial frequencies rotating slowly. The child views this with the amblyopic eye while drawing on a plate over the grating.
*   **Perceptual Learning:** Computerized active vision therapy software.

**5. Treatment of Eccentric Fixation ([[Pleoptics]])**
*   Used when the fovea is not used for fixation.
*   **Principle:** Dazzling the perifoveal retina (the eccentric fixation point) with bright light while shielding the fovea, followed by stimulating the fovea with flashing lights to re-establish foveal superiority (using a Projectoscope or Euthyscope).

**6. Pharmacological Therapy**
*   **Levodopa/Carbidopa:** Dopamine precursor. May temporarily improve vision by enhancing retinal neurotransmission, usually used as an adjunct to occlusion in older children.
