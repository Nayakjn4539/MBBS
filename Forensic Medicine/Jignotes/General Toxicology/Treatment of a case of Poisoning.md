# [[General Toxicology]] > Treatment of a case of Poisoning

The management of a case of poisoning is a medical emergency requiring a systematic approach. The treatment protocols are broadly classified into stabilization, decontamination, antidote administration, elimination, and supportive care.

### 1. Immediate Resuscitative Measures (Stabilization)
The primary objective is to keep the patient alive. This takes precedence over identifying the specific poison. The **ABCD** of resuscitation must be followed:

*   **A - Airway:** Ensure a patent airway. Remove secretions, vomitus, or foreign bodies. Insert an oropharyngeal airway or perform [[Endotracheal Intubation]] if the patient is comatose or has lost the gag reflex.
*   **B - Breathing:** Assess respiratory rate and depth. If respiratory depression is present, provide artificial respiration or mechanical ventilation with 100% oxygen.
*   **C - Circulation:** Monitor pulse and blood pressure. Start [[Intravenous Fluids]] (Crystalloids/Normal Saline) to maintain perfusion. If hypotension persists, vasopressors (e.g., Dopamine) may be required.
*   **D - Depression of CNS:** Treat coma and convulsions.
    *   **Coma Cocktail:** In cases of coma of unknown origin, a diagnostic/therapeutic cocktail may be administered:
        1.  **Dextrose:** 100 ml of 50% solution (to rule out [[Hypoglycemia]]).
        2.  **Thiamine (Vit B1):** 100 mg (to prevent Wernicke's encephalopathy in alcoholics).
        3.  **Naloxone:** 0.4–2 mg (to reverse [[Opioid Poisoning]]).

### 2. Removal of Unabsorbed Poison (Decontamination)
The method depends on the route of exposure.

#### A. Inhaled Poisons
*   Move the patient to fresh air immediately.
*   Maintain a clear airway and administer oxygen.
*   Artificial respiration if necessary.

#### B. Injected Poisons (e.g., Snake bite)
*   Apply a ligature/tourniquet proximal to the site (use with caution to avoid gangrene).
*   Immobilize the limb.
*   Cold packs/ice may slow absorption (vasoconstriction).

#### C. Contact Poisons (Skin/Eyes)
*   **Skin:** Remove contaminated clothing. Wash the area thoroughly with soap and water for 15–30 minutes.
*   **Eyes:** Irrigate with copious amounts of normal saline or water for 15–20 minutes. Consult an ophthalmologist.

#### D. Ingested Poisons (Gut Decontamination)
This is the most common route. Methods include:

**1. Gastric Lavage (Stomach Wash)**
It is useful if performed within **1–2 hours** of ingestion.
*   **Tube:** [[Ewald's Tube]] or Boas tube (wide bore) for adults; Ryle's tube for children.
*   **Position:** **Left lateral position** with the head lower than the hips (Trendelenburg) to prevent aspiration.
*   **Procedure:** A mouth gag is used. The tube is lubricated and passed (approx. 50 cm). Stomach contents are aspirated first (save for analysis). Then, 200–250 ml of warm water/saline is introduced and siphoned out. Repeat until the return fluid is clear.
*   **Lavaging Fluids:**
    *   **Warm water/Saline:** General purpose.
    *   **Potassium Permanganate (1:5000):** Oxidizes alkaloids (Opium, Strychnine) and Phosphorus.
    *   **Sodium Thiosulfate:** For Cyanide.
    *   **Calcium Gluconate/Lactate:** For Oxalates (precipitates calcium oxalate).
    *   **Castor oil/Warm water:** For Carbolic acid (Phenol).
    *   **Desferrioxamine:** For Iron poisoning.

**Contraindications for Gastric Lavage:**
> **Mnemonic: C-C-C-P-V** (USSR Flag)
> *   **C**orrosives (Risk of perforation, except in Carbolic acid where mucosa is leathery).
> *   **C**onvulsants (Strychnine - precipitates seizures).
> *   **C**oma (Unless airway is protected by a cuffed endotracheal tube).
> *   **P**etroleum distillates/Kerosene (Risk of aspiration chemical pneumonitis).
> *   **V**olatile poisons.

**2. Emesis**
Inducing vomiting is rarely recommended now due to risk of aspiration.
*   **Agents:** Syrup of Ipecac (obsolete), mechanical stimulation of fauces.
*   **Contraindications:** Same as Gastric Lavage.

**3. Activated Charcoal**
*   **Mechanism:** Adsorbs the poison on its large surface area, preventing absorption.
*   **Dose:** 1 g/kg body weight (approx. 50–100 g) as a slurry with water.
*   **Multiple Dose Activated Charcoal (MDAC):** Useful for drugs with enterohepatic circulation (e.g., Carbamazepine, Dapsone, Phenobarbitone, Theophylline, Quinine).
*   **Ineffective against:** Alcohols (Ethanol, Methanol), Corrosives, Heavy metals (Iron, Lithium, Lead), Cyanide.

**4. Catharsis**
Use of laxatives to hasten the expulsion of poison from the bowel.
*   **Agents:** Sorbitol, Magnesium sulfate, Sodium sulfate.
*   **Contraindication:** Corrosives, severe dehydration, bowel obstruction.

**5. Whole Bowel Irrigation**
Administration of large volumes of Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) electrolyte solution.
*   **Indication:** Body packers (cocaine/heroin packets), sustained-release tablets, heavy metals (Iron, Lithium).

### 3. Administration of Antidotes
Antidotes counteract the effects of poisons. They are classified based on their mechanism.

| Type of Antidote | Mechanism | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mechanical/Physical** | Impedes absorption or coats mucosa (Demulcents) | **Activated Charcoal** (Adsorbs), **Egg white/Milk** (Coats mucosa in corrosives), **Liquid Paraffin** (Dissolves fat-soluble poisons like Kerosene). |
| **Chemical** | Reacts chemically to neutralize or precipitate the poison | **KMnO4** (Oxidizes Opium), **Weak acids/alkalis** (Neutralize alkalis/acids - *Caution: Heat generation*), **Common Salt** (Precipitates Silver nitrate), **Calcium gluconate** (Precipitates Oxalates). |
| **Physiological/ Pharmacological** | Acts on tissue receptors to produce opposite effects | **Atropine** (for Organophosphates), **Naloxone** (for Opioids), **Ethanol** (for Methanol - competitive inhibition). |
| **Chelating Agents** | Forms stable, non-toxic complexes with metals for excretion | **BAL (Dimercaprol)** (Arsenic, Mercury), **EDTA** (Lead), **Desferrioxamine** (Iron), **D-Penicillamine** (Copper). |

**Important Specific Antidotes:**
*   **Paracetamol:** [[N-Acetylcysteine]]
*   **Organophosphates:** [[Atropine]] & Pralidoxime (PAM)
*   **Benzodiazepines:** Flumazenil
*   **Opioids:** Naloxone
*   **Cyanide:** Amyl nitrite, Sodium nitrite, Sodium Thiosulfate
*   **Methanol:** Ethanol or Fomepizole
*   **Iron:** Desferrioxamine

> **Mnemonic for Universal Antidote (Historical):** **M-A-T**
> *   **M**agnesium Oxide (Neutralizes acid)
> *   **A**ctivated Charcoal (Adsorbs)
> *   **T**annic Acid (Precipitates alkaloids)
> *(Note: This is now considered obsolete).*

### 4. Elimination of Absorbed Poison
Techniques to remove poison that has already entered the systemic circulation.

*   **Forced Diuresis:** Increasing urine output to excrete renal-cleared drugs.
    *   **Forced Alkaline Diuresis:** Using Sodium Bicarbonate to raise urine pH to 7.5–8.5. Useful for weak acids like **Salicylates (Aspirin)** and **Barbiturates (Phenobarbitone)** (Ion trapping prevents reabsorption).
    *   *Forced Acid Diuresis:* (Using Ammonium chloride) is no longer recommended due to risks of acidosis and rhabdomyolysis.
*   **Extracorporeal Techniques:**
    *   **Hemodialysis:** Effective for dialyzable, water-soluble, low molecular weight toxins (e.g., **Methanol**, Ethylene glycol, **Salicylates**, Lithium).
    *   **Hemoperfusion:** Blood is passed through a charcoal or resin column. Better for lipid-soluble, high molecular weight poisons (e.g., Theophylline, Barbiturates).
    *   **Peritoneal Dialysis:** Less efficient than hemodialysis but easier to perform.

### 5. Symptomatic and Supportive Care
Treat the symptoms as they arise while the body metabolizes the poison.
*   **Pain:** Analgesics (Morphine - avoid in respiratory depression).
*   **Convulsions:** Benzodiazepines (Diazepam, Lorazepam).
*   **Hypotension:** Fluids, Inotropes.
*   **Hypothermia/Hyperthermia:** Warming blankets / Cooling measures.
*   **Nursing Care:** Prevent bedsores, maintain hygiene, catheterization if required.
*   **Psychiatric Care:** Once stable, suicide risk assessment and counseling are mandatory.

### 6. Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Duty to Treat:** Saving life is the primary duty (Section 32 IPC – Omission of duty).
*   **Preserve Samples:** Gastric lavage samples, vomitus, and urine must be preserved, sealed, and handed over to the police for chemical analysis.
*   **Inform Police:** Mandatory in all cases of suspected poisoning (Section 39 CrPC). Failure to inform is punishable under Section 176 IPC.
*   **Dying Declaration:** If the patient is critical, arrange for a dying declaration.
