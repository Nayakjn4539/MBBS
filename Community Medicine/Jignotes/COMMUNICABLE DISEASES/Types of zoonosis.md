# Types of Zoonosis

[[Zoonoses]] are defined as those diseases and infections which are naturally transmitted between vertebrate animals and man. More than 150 zoonoses have been recognized.

They are broadly classified based on three major criteria: the direction of transmission, the life cycle of the infecting organism, and the etiological agent.

### 1. Classification based on Direction of Transmission

This classification focuses on the reservoir hosts and the movement of the pathogen.

*   **[[Anthropozoonoses]]**:
    *   Infections transmitted from **animals** (zoo) to **man** (anthro).
    *   *Examples:* [[Rabies]], [[Plague]], Anthrax, Hydatid disease, Trichinosis.
*   **[[Zooanthroponoses]]** (also called **Reverse Zoonoses**):
    *   Infections transmitted from **man** (anthro) to **animals** (zoo).
    *   *Example:* Human [[Tuberculosis]] in cattle.
*   **[[Amphixenoses]]**:
    *   Infections maintained in both man and lower vertebrate animals that may be transmitted in **either direction**.
    *   *Examples:* *Trypanosoma cruzi* (Chagas disease), *Schistosoma japonicum*.

### 2. Classification based on Life Cycle (Epidemiological)

This classification is based on the type of life cycle of the infecting organism and is highly significant for teaching and understanding transmission dynamics.

| Type | Definition | Key Feature | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Direct Zoonoses]]** | Transmitted from infected vertebrate to susceptible vertebrate by direct contact, fomite, or mechanical vector. | Agent undergoes **no developmental change** or propagation during transmission. | [[Rabies]], [[Brucellosis]], Trichinosis. |
| **[[Cyclo-Zoonoses]]** | Requires **more than one vertebrate host** species to complete the developmental cycle. | **No invertebrate host** is involved. | [[Taeniasis]], [[Echinococcosis]]. |
| **[[Meta-Zoonoses]]** | Transmitted biologically by **invertebrate vectors**. | Agent multiplies/develops in the vector. Requires an [[extrinsic incubation period]]. | [[Plague]], Schistosomiasis, Arboviral infections. |
| **[[Sapro-Zoonoses]]** | Requires a vertebrate host and a **non-animal** developmental site/reservoir. | Reservoir includes organic matter, soil, or plants. | Mycoses, Cutaneous larva migrans. |

### 3. Classification based on Etiological Agents

Zoonoses can also be grouped according to the type of causative pathogen.

*   **Bacterial Zoonoses:**
    *   [[Anthrax]] (Herbivores)
    *   [[Brucellosis]] (Cattle, goats, sheep)
    *   [[Plague]] (Rodents)
    *   [[Leptospirosis]] (Rodents)
    *   [[Tuberculosis]] (Bovine).
*   **Viral Zoonoses:**
    *   [[Rabies]] (Dogs, bats, wild carnivores)
    *   [[Yellow Fever]] (Monkeys)
    *   [[Japanese Encephalitis]] (Pigs, birds)
    *   [[Kyasanur Forest Disease]] (Rodents, monkeys)
    *   Monkeypox.
*   **Rickettsial Zoonoses:**
    *   [[Scrub typhus]] (Rodents)
    *   [[Murine typhus]] (Rodents)
    *   [[Q fever]] (Cattle, sheep, goats).
*   **Protozoal Zoonoses:**
    *   [[Leishmaniasis]] (Dogs)
    *   [[Toxoplasmosis]] (Cats, birds)
    *   Trypanosomiasis.
*   **Helminthic Zoonoses:**
    *   [[Hydatid disease]] (Dogs)
    *   [[Taeniasis]] (Cattle, pigs)
    *   Schistosomiasis.

### Clinical Relevance
*   **History Taking:** When dealing with fever of unknown origin (FUO) or obscure symptoms, always ask about occupation (farmers, veterinarians, butchers are high risk) and contact with pets or wild animals.
*   **Prevention:** Control of zoonoses involves controlling the disease in animals (e.g., vaccinating dogs for rabies), controlling the vehicle of transmission (e.g., pasteurization of milk for brucellosis), and protecting high-risk groups in humans.
