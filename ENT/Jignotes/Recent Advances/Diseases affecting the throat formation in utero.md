# [[Recent Advances]] > Diseases affecting the throat formation in utero

### Congenital Anomalies of the Throat (Pharynx and Larynx)

The formation of the throat structures involves complex embryological development of the [[Branchial Arches]], pouches, and clefts. Disruptions during this period lead to specific congenital anomalies affecting the nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx.

### I. Anomalies of the Nasopharynx

#### 1. [[Choanal Atresia]]
This is the persistence of the **nasobuccal membrane of Hochstetter**, failing to rupture between the 7th and 8th week of gestation,.
*   **Pathology:** A plate of tissue (bony or membranous) separates the nasal cavity from the nasopharynx.
    *   **Bony:** 90% (Thick at edges, thin in center),.
    *   **Membranous:** 10%.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Unilateral:** More common, often asymptomatic until adulthood or presents with unilateral discharge,.
    *   **Bilateral:** Life-threatening emergency at birth.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Cyclical Hypoxia:** The neonate cries (mouth opens, hypoxia relieved) $\rightarrow$ quiet (mouth closes, obstruction occurs) $\rightarrow$ hypoxia returns.
    *   Neonates are **obligate nasal breathers** because the high position of the larynx allows the epiglottis to lock with the soft palate.
*   **Associated Syndromes:**
    *   **[[CHARGE Syndrome]]** (Seen in 25% of cases),.
        *   **C**oloboma
        *   **H**eart defects
        *   **A**tresia of choanae
        *   **R**etarded growth
        *   **G**enital hypoplasia
        *   **E**ar anomalies
*   **Diagnosis:** Failure to pass a catheter, dye test (methylene blue), or **CT Scan (Axial view)**,.
*   **Management:** Emergency airway stabilization (McGovern technique/oral airway) followed by surgical repair (transnasal puncture/drilling),.

#### 2. [[Thornwaldt’s Cyst]] (Pharyngeal Bursitis)
*   **Embryology:** Represents the persistence of the communication between the notochord and the pharyngeal endoderm (Pouch of Luschka),.
*   **Location:** Median recess in the posterior wall of the nasopharynx within the adenoid mass.
*   **Clinical Features:** Usually asymptomatic; infection leads to occipital headache and post-nasal drip.

#### 3. [[Teratomas]] of Nasopharynx
*   **Pathology:** Tumors containing elements of all three germ layers.
*   **Presentation:** Can present as a **Hairy Polyp** (dermoid with skin appendages) causing neonatal respiratory distress.

### II. Anomalies of the Oropharynx and Oral Cavity

#### 1. [[Cleft Lip and Palate]]
*   **Embryology:** Failure of fusion of the maxillary processes with the medial nasal processes (lip) or the palatine shelves (palate),.
*   **Clinical Implication:**
    *   **Feeding difficulties** and speech defects (Rhinolalia aperta).
    *   **Eustachian Tube Dysfunction:** Due to abnormal insertion/function of the **Tensor Veli Palatini** muscle, leading to [[Otitis Media with Effusion]] (OME).
    *   **Submucous Cleft:** Triad of bifid uvula, notches hard palate, and muscle diastasis,.

#### 2. [[Lingual Thyroid]]
*   **Embryology:** Failure of the thyroid gland to descend from the **Foramen Cecum** (base of tongue) to the neck.
*   **Clinical Features:** Mass at the base of the tongue; may cause dysphagia, dysphonia, or airway obstruction,.
*   **Note:** It may be the *only* functioning thyroid tissue in the body; thyroid scan is essential before removal.

#### 3. [[Branchial Cysts]] and Fistulas
*   **Embryology:** Persistence of the branchial clefts or pouches.
*   **[[Second Branchial Cleft Cyst]]:** Most common. Located along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The tract passes *between* the internal and external carotid arteries.
*   **Clinical Features:** Painless, fluctuant neck mass; may become infected,.

### III. Congenital Anomalies of the Larynx

#### 1. [[Laryngomalacia]]
*   **Definition:** Most common congenital laryngeal anomaly. Characterized by excessive flaccidity of supraglottic structures,.
*   **Pathology:**
    *   Inward collapse of supraglottic structures during inspiration.
    *   **Omega-shaped epiglottis** ($\Omega$),.
    *   Short aryepiglottic folds.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Inspiratory Stridor:** Appears within 2 weeks of birth.
    *   **Positional Variation:** Stridor worsens in supine position; improves in **prone** position,.
    *   **Cry:** Usually normal.
*   **Management:** Usually conservative (resolves by 2 years). Surgical **Supraglottoplasty** for severe cases (failure to thrive, cyanosis).

#### 2. [[Congenital Subglottic Stenosis]]
*   **Pathology:** Abnormal thickening of the cricoid cartilage or fibrous tissue. Subglottis is the narrowest part of the pediatric airway.
*   **Diagnostic Criteria:** Subglottic diameter **< 4 mm** in full-term infant or **< 3 mm** in premature infant,.
*   **Clinical Features:** Biphasic stridor, recurrent croup.

#### 3. [[Laryngeal Web]]
*   **Embryology:** Failure of recanalization of the larynx (normally occurs at 10 weeks),.
*   **Location:** 75% are glottic; mostly anterior.
*   **Clinical Features:** Weak cry or aphonia at birth, biphasic stridor,.
*   **Management:** Thin webs cut (knife/CO2 laser); thick webs require laryngofissure and keel placement.

#### 4. [[Subglottic Hemangioma]]
*   **Pathology:** Vascular malformation.
*   **Clinical Features:** Asymptomatic at birth; stridor develops at 3–6 months (proliferative phase). 50% have associated cutaneous hemangiomas (beard distribution),.
*   **Treatment:** Propranolol (first line), steroids, or laser.

#### 5. [[Laryngoesophageal Cleft]] (Laryngeal Cleft)
*   **Embryology:** Failure of fusion of the posterior cricoid lamina and tracheoesophageal septum,.
*   **Clinical Features:** Aspiration, choking, cyanosis during feeding.
*   **Types:** Ranges from Type I (supraglottic) to Type IV (extends to thoracic trachea).

#### 6. [[Congenital Vocal Cord Paralysis]]
*   **Etiology:**
    *   **Unilateral:** Birth trauma (forceps delivery affecting RLN), mediastinal surgery.
    *   **Bilateral:** CNS anomalies like **Arnold-Chiari malformation**, hydrocephalus,.
*   **Clinical Features:** High-pitched cry, aspiration, stridor.

### IV. Syndromes Affecting Throat Formation

| Syndrome | Key Features | Airway/Throat Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Treacher Collins Syndrome]]** | Mandibular hypoplasia, malformed ears | Airway obstruction due to micrognathia, |
| **[[Pierre Robin Sequence]]** | Triad: **Micrognathia**, **Glossoptosis**, **Cleft Palate** | Tongue falls back causing obstruction, |
| **[[DiGeorge Sequence]]** | Failure of 3rd/4th pouch (Thymus/Parathyroid aplasia) | Hypocalcemia, immunological defects |
| **[[Cri-du-chat Syndrome]]** | Chromosomal deletion (5p) | High-pitched "cat-like" cry |

### Clinical Implications

*   **Airway Emergency:** Bilateral choanal atresia and bilateral vocal cord palsy require immediate airway intervention (intubation/tracheostomy),.
*   **Feeding:** Laryngeal clefts and severe laryngomalacia often present with failure to thrive due to feeding difficulties (choking/aspiration),.
*   **Mnemonic for Laryngomalacia:** **S-O-F-T**
    *   **S**upraglottic collapse
    *   **O**mega epiglottis
    *   **F**olds (aryepiglottic) are short
    *   **T**reatment is usually observation (Time)
