# [[Ear]] > Ossicles

### **Ossicles of the Middle Ear**

The middle ear contains three tiny bones, collectively known as the [[Ossicles]]. They form a mobile chain connecting the [[Tympanic Membrane]] laterally to the [[Oval Window]] medially. They are the smallest bones in the human body.

### **1. General Features and Arrangement**

*   **Function:** To transmit sound vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the inner ear fluid and provide impedance matching (transformer action),.
*   **Location:** Spanning the [[Tympanic Cavity]] (Middle Ear).
*   **Components:**
    1.  **[[Malleus]]** (Hammer)
    2.  **[[Incus]]** (Anvil)
    3.  **[[Stapes]]** (Stirrup)

### **2. Detailed Anatomy of Individual Ossicles**

#### **A. Malleus (Hammer)**
*   **Size:** Largest of the three ossicles; approximately 8 mm long.
*   **Parts:**
    *   **Head:** Rounded; lies in the **[[Epitympanum]]** (Attic). Articulates with the body of the incus.
    *   **Neck:** Constricted part below the head; lies against the **[[Pars Flaccida]]** (Shrapnell’s membrane).
    *   **Handle ([[Manubrium]]):** Extends downwards, backwards, and medially. It is embedded in the fibrous layer of the **[[Pars Tensa]]** of the tympanic membrane,. The tip of the handle forms the **[[Umbo]]**.
    *   **Lateral Process:** A knob-like projection at the upper end of the handle. It is attached to the tympanic membrane and creates a prominence on its outer surface,. It gives attachment to the anterior and posterior malleolar folds.
    *   **Anterior Process:** Connected to the petrotympanic fissure by the anterior ligament.

#### **B. Incus (Anvil)**
*   **Structure:** Resembles a premolar tooth with two roots.
*   **Parts:**
    *   **Body:** Large; lies in the **[[Epitympanum]]**. Articulates with the head of the malleus anteriorly,.
    *   **Short Process:** Projects backwards into the **[[Fossa Incudis]]** in the posterior wall of the attic,,.
    *   **Long Process:** Projects downwards vertically into the **[[Mesotympanum]]**, behind and parallel to the handle of the malleus,.
    *   **Lenticular Process:** A small, knob-like tip at the end of the long process. It articulates with the head of the stapes,.

#### **C. Stapes (Stirrup)**
*   **Size:** Smallest bone in the body (approx. 3.5 mm high; weight 2.5 mg),.
*   **Parts:**
    *   **Head:** Articulates with the lenticular process of the incus.
    *   **Neck:** Gives attachment to the tendon of the **[[Stapedius Muscle]]** posteriorly.
    *   **Crura (Limbs):** Two crura (Anterior and Posterior) connect the neck to the footplate. The anterior crus is thinner and straighter; the posterior crus is thicker and more curved.
    *   **Footplate (Base):** Oval-shaped; fits into the **[[Oval Window]]** (Fenestra Vestibuli) on the medial wall of the middle ear. It is held in place by the **[[Annular Ligament]]**.

### **3. Ossicular Joints**

The ossicles articulate via synovial joints, which allow them to move and transmit sound.

| Joint Name | Articulating Parts | Type of Joint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Incudomalleolar Joint]]** | Head of Malleus + Body of Incus | Saddle Joint (Synovial), |
| **[[Incudostapedial Joint]]** | Lenticular Process of Incus + Head of Stapes | Ball and Socket Joint (Synovial), |

**Clinical Note:** The Incudostapedial joint is the most common site of erosion in chronic ear disease due to its precarious blood supply.

### **4. Muscles Associated with Ossicles**

These muscles act to dampen loud sounds and protect the inner ear (Acoustic Reflex).

| Muscle | Origin | Insertion | Nerve Supply | Function | Embryological Arch |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Tensor Tympani]]** | Bony canal above Eustachian tube | Neck of **[[Malleus]]** (upper part of manubrium) | Mandibular Nerve (V3) | Tenses TM; pulls handle medially | 1st Arch, |
| **[[Stapedius]]** | Pyramidal eminence (posterior wall) | Neck of **[[Stapes]]** | Facial Nerve (CN VII) | Pulls stapes posteriorly; dampens vibrations | 2nd Arch, |

*   **[[Stapedial Reflex]]**: Loud sound (>70–100 dB) causes contraction of the Stapedius, stiffening the ossicular chain to prevent noise trauma.

---

### **5. Blood Supply**

*   The blood supply to the ossicles is derived from the **[[Stylomastoid Artery]]**, **[[Anterior Tympanic Artery]]**, and middle meningeal artery branches,.
*   **Crucial Point:** The mucosal network supplying the ossicles is fragile. The **[[Long Process of Incus]]** and its **[[Lenticular Process]]** have the poorest blood supply, making them the first to undergo necrosis in [[Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media]] (CSOM),.

### **6. Embryology of Ossicles**

The ossicles develop from the branchial (pharyngeal) arches.

| Structure | Embryological Origin |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Malleus Head & Neck** | 1st Arch (Meckel’s Cartilage) |
| **Incus Body & Short Process** | 1st Arch (Meckel’s Cartilage) |
| **Malleus Handle** | 2nd Arch (Reichert’s Cartilage)* |
| **Incus Long Process** | 2nd Arch (Reichert’s Cartilage)* |
| **Stapes Superstructure** (Head, Neck, Crura) | 2nd Arch (Reichert’s Cartilage) |
| **Stapes Footplate** | **[[Otic Capsule]]** (Bony Labyrinth), |
| **Annular Ligament** | Otic Capsule |

*(Note: While general teaching often simplifies Malleus/Incus to 1st Arch and Stapes to 2nd Arch, precise embryology indicates the manubrium and long process of incus have 2nd arch contributions).*

**Timeline:**
*   Ossicles attain adult shape and ossification by **25 weeks** of gestation.
*   The Stapes footplate differentiates from the otic capsule.

### **7. Physiology: Middle Ear Mechanics**

The ossicles act as a lever system to overcome the impedance mismatch between air (middle ear) and fluid (inner ear).

*   **Lever Ratio:** The handle of the [[Malleus]] is longer than the long process of the [[Incus]] (1.3 times longer).
*   **Mechanical Advantage:** This provides a lever ratio of **1.3:1**,.
*   **Total Transformer Ratio:** Combined with the areal ratio (TM area vs. Stapes footplate area = 17:1), the total mechanical advantage is **22:1**.

### **8. Clinical Implications and Applied Anatomy**

*   **[[Otosclerosis]] (Otospongiosis):**
    *   A hereditary disease of the bony labyrinth (otic capsule).
    *   Most commonly affects the **[[Fissula Ante Fenestram]]** (anterior to the oval window).
    *   Causes fixation of the **[[Stapes Footplate]]**, leading to conductive hearing loss,,.
    *   *Treatment:* **[[Stapedotomy]]** (making a hole in the footplate) or Stapedectomy (removing the stapes) and placing a prosthesis.

*   **Ossicular Necrosis in [[CSOM]]:**
    *   **Order of Necrosis:** Incus (Long process/Lenticular process) > Stapes crura > Malleus handle.
    *   **Reason:** The incus has a tenuous blood supply and is suspended in the center of the ear, making it vulnerable. The malleus is resistant due to multiple sources of blood supply.

*   **Ossicular Dislocation (Trauma):**
    *   **Incus Dislocation:** The most common ossicular injury in head trauma (temporal bone fracture) is dislocation of the **Incus**. This is because it is weakly anchored compared to the malleus (anchored by TM and tensor tympani) and stapes (anchored by annular ligament and stapedius).
    *   *Audiogram:* Shows maximum conductive hearing loss (approx. 50-60 dB).

*   **[[Tympanosclerosis]]:**
    *   Chalky white calcified plaques on the TM or ossicles.
    *   Can lead to fixation of the ossicular chain and conductive deafness,.

*   **[[Austin Classification]] of Ossicular Defects:**
    *   Used to plan **[[Ossiculoplasty]]** (reconstruction of ossicles).
    *   **Group A:** Malleus Present, Stapes Present (Good prognosis).
    *   **Group B:** Malleus Present, Stapes Absent.
    *   **Group C:** Malleus Absent, Stapes Present.
    *   **Group D:** Malleus Absent, Stapes Absent.

### **Mnemonics**

*   **MIS** (Ossicles from Lateral to Medial): **M**alleus -> **I**ncus -> **S**tapes.
*   **S**tapes is supplied by **S**eventh nerve (Facial), derived from **S**econd Arch.
*   **T**ensor **T**ympani is supplied by **T**rigeminal (**T**hird branch - V3).
