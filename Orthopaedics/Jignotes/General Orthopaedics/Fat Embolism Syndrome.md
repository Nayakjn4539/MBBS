# [[General Orthopaedics]] > Fat Embolism Syndrome

### Fat Embolism Syndrome (FES)

[[Fat Embolism Syndrome]] is a serious, potentially fatal complication of fractures characterized by the occlusion of small blood vessels by fat globules. It typically manifests as a triad of respiratory distress, cerebral abnormalities, and petechial rash.

---

### Etiology and Epidemiology
FES is most commonly associated with **polytrauma** and fractures of long bones.
*   **Common Sites:** [[Femur]] (most common), [[Tibia]], [[Pelvis]].
*   **Incidence:**
    *   More common in **young adults** with multiple fractures.
    *   Rare in children.
    *   Associated with **closed fractures** more than open fractures (due to higher intramedullary pressure containment).
    *   Can be precipitated by intramedullary reaming during nailing procedures.

### Pathophysiology
The dissemination of fat globules from the bone marrow into the bloodstream leads to the mechanical blockage of capillaries.
1.  **Mechanical Theory:** Fracture causes disruption of venous sinusoids in the marrow. High intramedullary pressure forces fat globules into the venous circulation. These globules lodge in the pulmonary capillaries.
2.  **Systemic Embolization:** Some globules pass through the pulmonary filter (or via a patent foramen ovale) to reach the systemic circulation, causing embolization in the **brain**, **skin**, **retina**, and **kidneys**.
3.  **Biochemical Theory:** Fat globules are hydrolyzed into [[Free Fatty Acids]] (FFAs), which are toxic to the capillary endothelium, causing chemical pneumonitis and vasculitis.

### Clinical Features
There is a characteristic **latent period** (lucid interval) of **24–72 hours** (typically 12–48 hours) between the injury and the onset of symptoms.

**The Classic Triad:**
1.  **Respiratory (Pulmonary):** Earliest and most common manifestation.
    *   Tachypnea, Dyspnea.
    *   Cyanosis.
    *   Hypoxia.
2.  **Cerebral (Neurological):** Due to cerebral embolism and hypoxia.
    *   Restlessness, confusion, irritability.
    *   Drowsiness, delirium, eventually coma.
3.  **Cutaneous (Dermatological):**
    *   **Petechial Rash:** Seen in the axilla, anterior chest wall, and subconjunctiva. These are pathognomonic but appear late (2nd or 3rd day).

**Other Signs:**
*   Tachycardia (>110/min).
*   Pyrexia (High-grade fever > 38.5°C) unrelated to infection.
*   Retinal hemorrhages/emboli.

### Diagnosis
Diagnosis is primarily clinical. **Gurd's Criteria** is the standard diagnostic tool.

#### Gurd’s Criteria
Diagnosis requires at least **1 Major** and **4 Minor** criteria.

| Category | Clinical Findings |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Major Criteria** | 1. **Respiratory Insufficiency** (PaO2 < 60 mmHg or 8 kPa) <br> 2. **Cerebral Involvement** (Confusion, drowsiness, coma) <br> 3. **Petechial Rash** (Axillary or subconjunctival) |
| **Minor Criteria** | 1. Tachycardia (> 110 beats/min) <br> 2. Pyrexia (> 38.5°C) <br> 3. Retinal signs (fat emboli on fundoscopy) <br> 4. Renal changes (Anuria or Oliguria) <br> 5. Jaundice <br> 6. Sudden drop in Hemoglobin (Anemia) <br> 7. Sudden Thrombocytopenia <br> 8. High ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) <br> 9. Fat macroglobulinemia (Fat in blood) |

**Diagnostic Mnemonic for Fat Embolism (4 Ts):**
*   **T**achycardia (>100/min)
*   **T**achypnea (>25/min)
*   **T**emperature (>37.8°C)
*   **T**hrombocytopenia (< 2 lakhs)

### Investigations
1.  **Arterial Blood Gas ([[ABG]]):**
    *   **Hypoxia:** PaO2 < 60 mmHg (First detectable sign).
    *   Decreased arterial oxygen saturation.
2.  **Chest X-ray ([[CXR]]):**
    *   **Snow-storm appearance:** Bilateral patchy pulmonary infiltrates (pulmonary edema/hemorrhage). usually appears late.
3.  **Urine Examination:**
    *   **Sizzling Test:** Detection of fat globules in urine (Lipuria).
4.  **Blood:**
    *   Thrombocytopenia (Low platelet count).
    *   Decreased Hematocrit/Hemoglobin.
5.  **ECG:**
    *   Prominent S-wave (signs of right heart strain).

### Management
Management is divided into prophylaxis (prevention) and definitive supportive treatment. There is no specific drug to dissolve fat emboli.

#### 1. Prophylaxis
*   **Early Immobilization:** Prompt splinting of fractures at the accident site reduces marrow embolization.
*   **Early Fixation:** Early internal fixation (within 24 hours) of long bone fractures reduces the incidence of FES.
*   **Gentle Handling:** Avoid unnecessary manipulation of the fractured limb (e.g., during transport).
*   **Maintain Hydration:** Prevent hypovolemic shock.

#### 2. Definitive Treatment (Supportive)
The goal is to support the respiratory system until the body clears the fat load.
*   **Respiratory Support:**
    *   High-concentration **Oxygen** therapy (mask/nasal prongs) to maintain PaO2 > 70 mmHg.
    *   **Mechanical Ventilation (IPPV/PEEP):** Indicated if PaO2 falls below 60 mmHg despite O2 therapy or if the patient develops [[Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome]] (ARDS).
*   **Fluid Balance:**
    *   Maintenance of blood volume and electrolyte balance.
    *   Use of **Albumin** helps bind fatty acids.
*   **Pharmacotherapy (Adjunctive/Controversial):**
    *   **Corticosteroids:** (e.g., Methylprednisolone) May reduce the inflammatory response to FFAs and stabilize membranes. Used in severe cases.
    *   **Low Molecular Weight Dextran:** Improves microcirculatory flow.
    *   **Heparin:** May act as a lipase activator (clearing activity), but carries bleeding risks in trauma patients.
    *   **IV Alcohol (Ethanol):** 5% Dextrose with 5% Alcohol has been used historically to emulsify fat globules.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Alertness:** In any patient with a long bone fracture who develops confusion or breathlessness 2 days post-injury, FES must be the primary differential diagnosis.
*   **Subclinical FES:** Presence of laboratory abnormalities (hypoxia, thrombocytopenia) without overt clinical symptoms is common.
*   **Monitoring:** Pulse oximetry is vital in the first 48–72 hours for high-risk patients.

### Prognosis
*   FES is generally self-limiting.
*   Mortality rate is approximately 10–15%, usually due to progressive respiratory failure ([[ARDS]]).
*   With modern intensive care and early fracture fixation, prognosis has significantly improved.
