# [[Mechanical Injuries]] > Lacerations

### **Lacerations (Mechanical Injuries)**

**Definition**
A [[Laceration]] is a mechanical injury caused by the tearing, splitting, or bursting of tissues (skin, mucous membranes, muscles, or internal organs) due to the application of **blunt force**. It is produced when the stretching force exceeds the elasticity of the tissue.

> **Note:** Clinicians often incorrectly refer to any skin wound as a "laceration." In Forensic Medicine, a laceration specifically implies blunt trauma, whereas a cut implies sharp force.

**Mechanism of Production**
Lacerations are caused by **Blunt Force Trauma** via three main mechanisms:
1.  **Shearing:** A glancing blow or grinding compression (e.g., run-over cases).
2.  **Crushing:** Direct vertical impact compressing tissues against bone.
3.  **Stretching:** Overstretching of the skin leading to tearing (e.g., skin splitting over a bone).

### **General Characteristics of Lacerations**
The following features distinguish a laceration from an incised wound:

1.  **Margins/Edges:** They are **irregular**, ragged, serrated, and uneven.
2.  **Surroundings:** The margins are often **contused** (bruised) and **abraded** due to the blunt impact.
3.  **[[Tissue Bridges]]:** This is the **pathognomonic feature**. Nerves, blood vessels, and elastic connective tissues differ in tensile strength; stronger tissues remain intact across the depth of the wound, forming "bridges" between the two walls.
4.  **Hair Bulbs:** Hair bulbs are **crushed** rather than cut. Hair may be driven deep into the wound.
5.  **Bleeding:** Usually **less profuse** than incised wounds.
    *   *Reason:* The crushing force damages the intima of arteries, promoting thrombosis and retraction of vessel walls.
    *   *Exception:* Scalp lacerations bleed profusely due to vascularity and dense connective tissue preventing vessel retraction.
6.  **Foreign Bodies:** Debris, grease, dust, or fragments of the weapon are frequently found in the wound.
7.  **Shape:** Often stellate (star-shaped) or irregular, but can be linear.
8.  **Ends:** Usually blunt, irregular, or showing **"Swallow tails"** (tears at the ends of the wound diverging at an angle).

**Mnemonic for Features: TEAR**
*   **T** - **T**issue bridges present
*   **E** - **E**dges irregular and contused
*   **A** - **A**brasion collar present
*   **R** - **R**educed bleeding (compared to cuts)

### **Types of Lacerations**

#### 1. Split Laceration (Incised-Looking Laceration)
*   **Mechanism:** Produced when the skin is crushed between a hard blunt object (e.g., lathi, iron rod, ground) and an underlying hard bone.
*   **Common Sites:** Scalp, eyebrows, cheekbones (zygoma), chin, shin (tibia), and iliac crest.
*   **Appearance:** The skin splits linearly and looks like a clean cut (incised wound).
*   **Differentiation:** A hand lens examination reveals irregular edges, tissue bridges, and crushed hair bulbs, confirming it is a laceration.

#### 2. Stretch Laceration
*   **Mechanism:** Caused by overstretching of the skin and soft tissues until they tear.
*   **Example:** In run-over traffic accidents, the skin may tear at a distance from the point of tyre impact due to the dragging force. The tear flap usually points towards the direction of the force.

#### 3. Avulsion (Flaying/Shearing)
*   **Mechanism:** A heavy shearing force separates the skin and subcutaneous tissue from the underlying deep fascia and muscle.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Degloving injury:** Skin of the hand or limb is stripped off like a glove (common in machinery accidents or run-over cases).
    *   **Automobile accidents:** A rotating wheel passes over a limb, forcing the skin to detach ("rolling pin" effect).
*   **Healing:** Difficult due to severed blood supply; often requires grafting.

#### 4. Tear Laceration
*   Caused by impact with a semi-sharp or irregular object (e.g., a broken glass bottle rim or a stone) which tears the skin rather than cutting it cleanly.

#### 5. Crush Laceration
*   Caused by heavy blunt impact causing severe destruction and fragmentation of tissues below the skin (e.g., hammer blow).

### **Difference between Lacerated Wound and Incised Wound**

| Feature | Lacerated Wound | Incised Wound (Cut) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cause** | Blunt object | Sharp-edged object |
| **Margins** | Irregular, ragged, serrated | Clean-cut, smooth, regular |
| **Abrasion/Bruising** | Present at margins | Absent |
| **[[Tissue Bridges]]** | **Present** (Pathognomonic) | Absent |
| **Hair Bulbs** | Crushed | Cut cleanly |
| **Bleeding** | Less (vessels crushed) | Profuse (vessels cut open) |
| **Depth** | Variable | Usually constant |
| **Foreign Body** | Frequently present | Usually absent (unless glass) |
| **Healing** | Slow, more scarring | Rapid, minimal scarring |

### **Complications of Lacerations**
1.  **Hemorrhage:** Can be fatal if major vessels (like scalp or femoral) are involved.
2.  **Infection:** High risk due to devitalized tissue and foreign bodies. Can lead to suppuration or gangrene.
3.  **Fat Embolism:** Crushing of subcutaneous fat can force fat globules into circulation (pulmonary fat embolism).
4.  **Scarring:** Heals by secondary intention, resulting in puckered, disfiguring scars.

### **Medicolegal Importance**
1.  **Type of Weapon:** Indicates the use of a **blunt weapon** (stone, stick, vehicle, fist).
2.  **Manner of Injury:** Mostly **Accidental** (RTA, falls) or **Homicidal** (assault). rarely suicidal (suicides prefer sharp weapons or ligatures).
3.  **Identification of Weapon:** Trace evidence (paint, rust, grease, glass) found deep in the wound can link the injury to a specific weapon or crime scene (Locard's Exchange Principle).
4.  **Determination of Force:** The severity and depth indicate the amount of force used.
5.  **Reconstruction:** Avulsion injuries can indicate the direction of force (e.g., the direction a vehicle wheel moved over a limb).
6.  **Simulation:** Split lacerations on the scalp must be carefully differentiated from incised wounds to prevent misinterpretation of the weapon used.
