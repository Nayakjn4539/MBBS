# Blue Sclera

### Definition and Mechanism
**[[Blue Sclera]]** is a condition characterized by a generalized or localized bluish discoloration of the sclera.
*   **Mechanism:** It occurs due to the thinning of the scleral collagen fibers. This thinning allows the underlying dark pigment of the [[Uveal Tissue]] (choroid and ciliary body) to shine through the sclera, creating a blue appearance.
*   **Physiological:** The sclera is normally bluish in babies/newborns, but this effect usually reduces with age as the sclera thickens.

### Etiology (Causes)

The causes can be broadly classified into Systemic Connective Tissue Disorders and Ocular Conditions.

#### 1. Systemic Connective Tissue Disorders
These conditions involve defects in collagen synthesis or structure, affecting the scleral integrity globally.

| Condition | Key Features & Associations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Osteogenesis Imperfecta]]** | • **Most common systemic association**.<br>• Characterized by the triad of: **Blue Sclera**, **Fragilitas ossium** (frequent bone fractures), and **Deafness** (otosclerosis).<br>• Hereditary condition persisting throughout life. |
| **[[Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome]]** | • Characterized by hyperextensibility of joints, loose skin, and tissue fragility.<br>• Type VI is specifically associated with ocular fragility and blue sclera. |
| **[[Marfan Syndrome]]** | • Associated with skeletal abnormalities (tall stature, arachnodactyly) and ocular features like [[Ectopia Lentis]] (subluxation of lens). |
| **[[Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum]]** | • Affects elastic fibers of skin, eyes (angioid streaks), and cardiovascular system. |
| **[[Lowe's Syndrome]]** | • Oculo-cerebro-renal syndrome.<br>• Features: Congenital cataract, glaucoma, and blue sclera. |
| **[[Turner Syndrome]]** | • Genetic condition (XO) associated with blue sclera, ptosis, and cataract. |

#### 2. Ocular Conditions (Local Causes)
These usually result in localized thinning or stretching of the sclera.

*   **[[Buphthalmos]] (Congenital Glaucoma):**
    *   Raised intraocular pressure in children causes stretching of the entire cornea and sclera (before age 3).
    *   The sclera becomes thin and appears blue due to the underlying uveal tissue.
*   **[[High Myopia]] (Pathological Myopia):**
    *   Excessive axial elongation of the eyeball leads to generalized thinning of the sclera, particularly the posterior segment (Posterior Staphyloma).
*   **Healed [[Scleritis]]:**
    *   Recurrent inflammation leads to scleral thinning. The healed area appears as a dark purple or bluish cicatrix.
*   **[[Scleromalacia Perforans]]:**
    *   A form of **Necrotizing Scleritis without inflammation**.
    *   Typically seen in elderly women with long-standing **[[Rheumatoid Arthritis]]**.
    *   Characterized by painless melting of the sclera, exposing the underlying dark bluish uvea.
*   **[[Staphyloma]]:**
    *   Localized bulging of weak/thin outer tunic (cornea or sclera) lined by uveal tissue.
    *   **Ciliary Staphyloma:** Bulge of weak sclera lined by ciliary body; has a bluish color.
    *   **Intercalary Staphyloma:** Localized bulge in the limbal area.

### Clinical Implications

1.  **Diagnosis:** The presence of blue sclera in an adult is pathological and warrants a workup for connective tissue disorders or chronic ocular disease.
2.  **Fracture Risk:** In a child presenting with blue sclera, rule out [[Osteogenesis Imperfecta]]. History of frequent fractures is a key indicator.
3.  **Surgical Caution:** Patients with blue sclera (e.g., Buphthalmos or Ehlers-Danlos) have extremely thin sclerae. Great care must be taken during surgeries (like trabeculectomy or squint surgery) to avoid inadvertent **globe perforation**.
