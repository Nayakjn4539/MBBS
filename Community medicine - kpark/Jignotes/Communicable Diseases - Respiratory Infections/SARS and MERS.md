# [[Communicable Diseases - Respiratory Infections]] > SARS and MERS

### Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)

**1. Identification**
SARS is a communicable viral disease that emerged in Southern China in 2002. It progresses from a febrile illness to severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. It is distinct from other respiratory infections due to its rapid deterioration and high mortality rate.

**2. Epidemiological Determinants**

*   **Agent Factors:**
    *   **Agent:** [[SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV)]]. It differs genetically from previously recognized coronaviruses.
    *   **Survival:** Can survive for hours on surfaces, up to 4 days in human waste, and at least 24 hours on plastic surfaces at room temperature.
    *   **Disinfectants:** Sensitive to lipid solvents (ether, ethanol 75%), chlorine-containing disinfectants, and formalin.

*   **Host Factors:**
    *   **Reservoir:** Natural reservoir appears to be the [[Horseshoe bat]].
    *   **Amplifying Host:** [[Civet cats]] (palm civets) were the presumed reservoir/amplifying host during the 2002 outbreak.
    *   **High-Risk Groups:** Healthcare workers (HCWs) accounted for ~21% of cases (especially those involved in aerosol-generating procedures). Children are rarely affected.
    *   **Age:** Mortality is higher in the elderly (over 65 years).

*   **Environmental Factors:**
    *   International travel (flights) played a major role in the global spread (pandemic potential).

**3. Mode of Transmission**
*   **Direct Contact:** Mucous membranes of eyes, nose, or mouth.
*   **Droplet Infection:** Respiratory droplets.
*   **Fomites:** Contaminated surfaces/objects.
*   **Aerosol-generating procedures:** Endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, and nebulization amplify transmission.
*   **Excretion:** Virus is shed in stools (faecal-oral role is possible but not fully defined).

**4. Incubation Period**
*   **Range:** 2 to 7 days.
*   **Commonly:** 3 to 5 days.

**5. Clinical Picture**
*   **Prodrome:** Sudden onset of high fever (>38°C), malaise, chills, headache, myalgia, dizziness.
*   **Respiratory Phase:** After 3–7 days, a dry, non-productive cough develops.
*   **Progression:** Rapid deterioration with low oxygen saturation and acute respiratory distress.
*   **Radiology:** Chest X-ray shows small unilateral patchy shadowing progressing to bilateral, generalized interstitial/confluent infiltrates.

> *   **S**evere Fever (>38°C)
> *   **A**ches (Myalgia/Headache)
> *   **R**espiratory distress (Cough/Dyspnea)
> *   **S**hadowing on X-ray

**6. Diagnosis**
*   **RT-PCR (Reverse Transcriptase PCR):** Detection of viral RNA in 2 different clinical specimens (e.g., nasopharyngeal and stool) or the same specimen collected on 2 occasions.
*   **Serology (ELISA/IFA):** Detection of antibodies (negative in acute phase, positive in convalescent phase, or 4-fold rise in titre).
*   **Viral Culture.**

**7. Complications**
*   **ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome):** Occurs in ~16% of patients.
*   **Mechanical Ventilation:** Required in 20–30% of cases.
*   **Mortality:** Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is approximately 10% (can reach 50% in elderly).

**8. Treatment**
*   **No specific antiviral drug** or vaccine exists for SARS.
*   **Supportive Care:** Intensive care support, supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation.
*   **Experimental therapies** (used in 2003 with inconclusive results): Ribavirin, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Corticosteroids.

**9. Prevention and Control**
*   **Isolation:** Strict isolation of patients (barrier nursing).
*   **PPE:** Appropriate protection for medical staff (N95 masks, gowns, gloves, eye protection).
*   **Quarantine:** Surveillance of contacts.
*   **Screening:** Exit screening of international travelers during epidemics.
*   **Disinfection:** Hygienic measures (hand washing).

### Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)

**1. Identification**
Also known as **MERS-CoV**, this is a viral respiratory illness first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. It is caused by a coronavirus distinct from SARS-CoV.

**2. Epidemiological Determinants**
*   **Agent:** [[Betacoronavirus]] (Lineage C), designated as MERS-CoV.
*   **Reservoir:** [[Bats]] are the likely ultimate reservoir.
*   **Intermediate Host:** [[Dromedary Camels]].
*   **Origin:** Saudi Arabia (2012).

**3. Mode of Transmission**
*   **Zoonotic:** Direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels.
*   **Food-borne:** Consumption of raw/undercooked camel meat or unpasteurized camel milk.
*   **Human-to-Human:** Possible, primarily through close contact (droplets) in healthcare settings or households, though sustained community transmission is rare.

> **Mnemonic for Transmission: "CAMEL"**
> *   **C**ontact with
> *   **A**rabian (Dromedary)
> *   **M**ammals (Camels)
> *   **E**ating raw meat
> *   **L**iquids (Drinking raw milk)

**4. Incubation Period**
*   **Range:** 2 to 14 days.

**5. Clinical Features**
*   Range from asymptomatic infection to severe acute respiratory disease.
*   Fever, cough, shortness of breath.
*   Gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea) are also reported.
*   Severe illness can cause respiratory failure and kidney failure.

**6. Mortality**
*   **Case Fatality Rate (CFR):** High, approximately **30% to 40%**.

**7. Treatment and Prevention**
*   **Treatment:** No specific treatment or vaccine is available. Treatment is intensive supportive care.
*   **Prevention:** Hand hygiene, food safety (avoid raw camel products), and infection control in hospitals.
