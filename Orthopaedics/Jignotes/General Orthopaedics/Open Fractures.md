# Open Fractures (Compound Fractures)

### Definition
An [[open fracture]] is a fracture in which there is a break in the overlying skin and soft tissues, establishing a communication between the fracture site (bone and hematoma) and the external environment.
*   **Old Terminology:** Previously called "compound fractures," but "open fracture" is preferred as it describes the pathology more accurately.
*   **Pathology:** The breach allows bacteria to enter, contaminating the wound. Simultaneously, blood from the fracture site escapes, preventing the formation of a tense [[fracture hematoma]].

### Mechanism of Injury
Understanding the mechanism helps predict soft tissue damage and contamination levels.

1.  **Indirect Violence (Inside-Out):**
    *   A sharp spike of the fractured bone pierces the skin from within.
    *   Usually low energy; less contamination and less soft tissue damage.
2.  **Direct Violence (Outside-In):**
    *   An external object or crushing force breaks the skin and the bone.
    *   Usually high energy (e.g., [[Road Traffic Accident]], firearm injury).
    *   Associated with extensive soft tissue crushing, periosteal stripping, and high contamination.

### Classification: Gustilo-Anderson
This is the gold standard classification system used to grade open fractures based on the size of the wound, the degree of soft tissue injury, and the extent of contamination. This classification determines prognosis and treatment protocols.

| Type | Description | Mechanism/Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type I** | Wound **< 1 cm** long. | Low energy. Usually "Inside-Out" puncture. Clean. Minimal soft tissue damage. Simple fracture pattern. |
| **Type II** | Wound **> 1 cm** long. | Moderate soft tissue damage but **no extensive soft tissue flaps or avulsions**. Moderate contamination. Fracture pattern may be simple or comminuted. |
| **Type III** | Extensive soft tissue damage. | High energy. Includes **segmental fractures**, **gunshot wounds**, **farm injuries**, or fractures in highly contaminated environments (sewage, soil). |
| **Type IIIA** | Adequate soft tissue coverage. | Despite extensive lacerations/flaps, the bone **can be covered** by existing soft tissue. Periosteal stripping is minimal. |
| **Type IIIB** | **Bone exposure**. | Extensive soft tissue loss with **periosteal stripping**. The bone cannot be covered by local tissue; requires a [[rotational flap]] or [[free flap]] for coverage. |
| **Type IIIC** | **Vascular Injury**. | Associated with an arterial injury requiring repair for limb salvage, regardless of the degree of soft tissue injury. |

**Clinical Implication:** The prognosis worsens from Type I to Type IIIC. Type IIIC has the highest risk of [[amputation]] and infection.

### Management Principles
The management of open fractures is a surgical emergency. The goals are to prevent infection, promote fracture healing, and restore function.

#### 1. Emergency Care (Pre-hospital & ER)
*   **Assessment:** Follow **ATLS** protocols (Airway, Breathing, Circulation). Rule out life-threatening injuries first.
*   **Local Care:**
    *   Check neurovascular status *before* and *after* any manipulation.
    *   **Do not probe** the wound in the ER (pushes contamination deeper).
    *   Cover with a sterile saline-soaked dressing.
    *   Splint the limb to prevent further soft tissue damage.
    *   Control hemorrhage with direct pressure.

#### 2. Antibiotic Prophylaxis
Antibiotics must be started as soon as possible (ideally within 3 hours). The choice depends on the severity:
*   **Type I & II:** First-generation Cephalosporin (e.g., [[Cefazolin]]).
*   **Type III:** Add an Aminoglycoside (e.g., [[Gentamicin]]) to cover Gram-negatives.
*   **Soil/Farm Injuries (Anaerobes):** Add [[Penicillin]] or [[Metronidazole]] to cover *Clostridium*.
*   **Duration:** Typically stopped 24–72 hours after wound closure to prevent resistance.

#### 3. Tetanus Prophylaxis
*   Assess immunization status.
*   Administer **Tetanus Toxoid (TT)** if the patient is immunized but the last dose was >5-10 years ago.
*   Administer **Tetanus Immunoglobulin (TIG)** + TT if the patient is unimmunized or status is unknown.

#### 4. Surgical Debridement (Wound Toilette)
This is the most critical step. "The solution to pollution is dilution."
*   **Timing:** Ideally within 6 hours (the "Golden Period"), though up to 24 hours is acceptable if antibiotics were started early.
*   **The 4 E's of Debridement**:
    1.  **E**xploration: Extend the wound to identify the zone of injury.
    2.  **E**xcision: Remove all dead/devitalized tissue (skin, fat, fascia, muscle) and loose bone fragments.
    3.  **E**vacuation: Remove hematoma and foreign bodies (dirt, clothing).
    4.  **E**rr on the side of caution: If tissue viability is doubtful, excise it (except for major nerves/vessels).
*   **Irrigation:** Copious lavage with normal saline (6–10 Liters) using a pulse lavage system if available.

**Clinical Implication:** Determining muscle viability is crucial. Use the **4 C's**:
1.  **C**olor (Red/Pink is viable).
2.  **C**onsistency (Firm is viable).
3.  **C**ontractility (Contracts on stimulation).
4.  **C**apacity to bleed (Bleeds when cut).
If muscle fails these criteria, it must be excised.

#### 5. Fracture Stabilization
Stabilizing the bone protects soft tissues and improves circulation.
*   **External Fixation:** The method of choice for Type IIIB and IIIC, or highly contaminated wounds. It allows wound access for dressing and plastic surgery.
*   **Internal Fixation (IM Nail):** Can be used in Type I and II fractures (and some clean Type IIIA). It carries a risk of biofilm formation if the debridement is inadequate.
*   **Plaster Cast:** Rarely used for open fractures (except stable Type I) as it obstructs wound care.

#### 6. Wound Closure
*   **Primary Closure:** rarely recommended. Only for very clean, low-energy (Type I) wounds treated early.
*   **Delayed Primary Closure (DPC):** The standard. The wound is left open, dressed, and closed after 3–5 days if clean.
*   **Flap Coverage:** Required for Type IIIB injuries (muscle flap or fasciocutaneous flap) within 5–7 days.

### Complications
1.  **Infection ([[Osteomyelitis]]):** The most common complication. Can be acute or chronic.
2.  **Non-union:** Due to bone loss, infection, or periosteal stripping.
3.  **[[Gas Gangrene]]:** Caused by *Clostridium perfringens* in soil-contaminated wounds. Life-threatening.
4.  **[[Compartment Syndrome]]:** Can occur even in open fractures if the fascia remains intact in other compartments.
5.  **Secondary Amputation:** May be required if infection is uncontrollable or functional recovery is impossible.
