# Laryngectomy Types

**Laryngectomy** involves the partial or complete surgical resection of the [[larynx]]. The extent of surgery depends on the tumor stage, site (supraglottic, glottic, subglottic), and the patient's pulmonary status. The primary goal is oncological cure, with secondary goals of preserving respiration, swallowing, and phonation.

### 1. Total Laryngectomy

**Definition:**
The complete removal of the [[larynx]], including the [[hyoid bone]], [[thyroid cartilage]], [[cricoid cartilage]], strap muscles, and one or more rings of the [[trachea]]. The pharyngeal wall is closed primarily, and the lower tracheal stump is sutured to the skin to form a permanent [[tracheostoma]].

**Indications:**
*   **T3 Lesions:** Transglottic tumors causing vocal cord fixation.
*   **T4 Lesions:** Extensive tumors with cartilage invasion (thyroid/cricoid) or extralaryngeal spread.
*   **Radiation Failure:** Recurrence after radiotherapy or conservation surgery.
*   **Dysfunctional Larynx:** Severe aspiration or extensive trauma rendering the larynx non-functional.

**Physiological Changes:**
*   **Respiration:** Breathing occurs solely through the permanent tracheostoma. The connection between the nose/mouth and the lungs is disconnected.
*   **Swallowing:** The air and food passages are completely separated. Aspiration is theoretically impossible unless a fistula develops.
*   **Phonation:** Natural laryngeal voice is lost. Rehabilitation is required via [[esophageal speech]], [[electrolarynx]], or [[tracheoesophageal puncture]] (TEP).
*   **Olfaction:** Loss of smell (anosmia) occurs due to lack of nasal airflow.

**Clinical Implication:**
> Patients with a **Total Laryngectomy** are "neck breathers." In an emergency, **do not** attempt to intubate the mouth or nose; oxygen must be administered via the stoma.

### 2. Conservation (Partial) Laryngectomy

These procedures aim to preserve voice, swallowing, and airway function without a permanent stoma. They are categorized into **Open Partial Laryngectomy** and **Transoral Laser Microsurgery (TLM)**.

#### A. Vertical Partial Laryngectomy (Hemilaryngectomy)
*   **Procedure:** Removal of one-half of the [[thyroid cartilage]], the ipsilateral [[false vocal cord]], [[true vocal cord]], and a portion of the [[subglottis]].
*   **Indication:** T1 or T2 [[glottic carcinoma]] involving only one vocal cord, not extending beyond the anterior commissure.
*   **Reconstruction:** Often uses strap muscles or cartilage to rebuild the glottic competence.

#### B. Horizontal Partial Laryngectomy (Supraglottic Laryngectomy)
*   **Procedure:** Excision of the [[supraglottis]] (epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds, false cords, and upper half of thyroid cartilage). The true vocal cords and arytenoids are preserved.
*   **Indication:** T1, T2, or early T3 supraglottic tumors that do not involve the glottis or postcricoid region.
*   **Functional Outcome:** Voice is usually good.
*   **Clinical Implication:** Since the protective mechanism (epiglottis/false cords) is removed, **aspiration** is a significant risk. Patients must have good pulmonary reserve to tolerate minor aspiration during the healing phase.

#### C. Supracricoid Laryngectomy
*   **Procedure:** Removal of the thyroid cartilage, paraglottic space, and both true and false cords. The [[cricoid cartilage]] and at least one [[arytenoid]] are preserved.
*   **Reconstruction:** **Cricohyoidopexy** (suturing cricoid to hyoid) or **Cricoepiglottopexy**.
*   **Indication:** T2 and early T3 tumors.

#### D. Near-Total Laryngectomy
*   **Procedure:** Removal of the entire larynx *except* for one uninvolved [[arytenoid cartilage]] and a strip of healthy tissue to create a biological shunt between the trachea and pharynx.
*   **Indication:** Advanced T3 or T4a lesions where one arytenoid is uninvolved, but the patient cannot undergo chemoradiation.
*   **Outcome:** Preserves lung-powered phonation (better speech than total laryngectomy) but still requires a permanent tracheostoma.

### 3. Transoral Laser Microsurgery (TLM)

This is a minimally invasive endoscopic resection, usually using a **CO2 laser**. It is the treatment of choice for early glottic cancers (T1, T2).

**European Laryngological Society Classification of Cordectomies:**

| Type | Name | Structures Resected |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type I** | Subepithelial | Epithelium only (stripping) |
| **Type II** | Subligamental | Epithelium + [[Reinke's space]] + [[vocal ligament]] |
| **Type III** | Transmuscular | Through the [[vocalis muscle]] |
| **Type IV** | Total Cordectomy | Complete resection of the vocal fold from anterior commissure to vocal process |
| **Type V** | Extended | Extended into contralateral cord, arytenoid, or false cord |
| **Type VI** | Anterior Commissure | Resection of anterior commissure with bilateral anterior cordectomy |

### Summary Table: Laryngectomy Procedures

| Feature | **Total Laryngectomy** | **Supraglottic Laryngectomy** | **Hemilaryngectomy** | **Near-Total Laryngectomy** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Extent** | Entire Larynx | Supraglottis only | One vertical half | Larynx minus 1 Arytenoid |
| **Stoma** | Permanent | Temporary (during healing) | Temporary | Permanent |
| **Voice** | Prosthetic/Esophageal | Normal/Hoarse | Hoarse | Lung-powered (Shunt) |
| **Swallowing**| Normal (No aspiration) | High Aspiration Risk | Mild Aspiration Risk | Normal |
| **Primary Indication**| T3 (fixed), T4, Recurrence | T1-T2 Supraglottic | T1-T2 Glottic | T3 (unilateral arytenoid saved) |

### Complications of Laryngectomy

*   **Pharyngocutaneous Fistula:** Saliva leaks from the pharynx to the skin. Common in post-irradiated necks.
*   **Stomal Stenosis:** Narrowing of the tracheostoma.
*   **Carotid Blowout:** Rupture of the carotid artery, often secondary to fistula and infection.
*   **Hypocalcemia:** Due to inadvertent removal or damage to [[parathyroid glands]] during associated thyroidectomy.
*   **Hypothyroidism:** Due to hemithyroidectomy or radiation.

### Mnemonic for Indications of Total Laryngectomy
**"FIXED"**
*   **F**ailure of radiation/conservation surgery
*   **I**nvasion of cartilage (Thyroid/Cricoid - T4)
*   **X** (Trans-glottic) tumors crossing the ventricle
*   **E**xtensive T3 with fixed cords
*   **D**estroyed/Dysfunctional larynx (trauma/aspiration)
