# [[Crush Syndrome]]

### Definition
[[Crush Syndrome]] (also known as traumatic [[Rhabdomyolysis]]) is a systemic manifestation resulting from the crushing of large muscle masses, characterized by muscle necrosis and the release of intracellular muscle constituents into the circulation. 

It was first described during the London Blitz in WWII. It is distinct from a simple crush injury (which is a local injury); Crush Syndrome implies the **systemic** sequelae of that injury, primarily involving **[[Acute Renal Failure]] (ARF)** and metabolic abnormalities.

### Etiology
Any condition that causes prolonged compression of muscle tissue can precipitate this syndrome.

*   **Traumatic Causes:**
    *   Building collapse (Earthquakes, bombings).
    *   Road traffic accidents (trapped victims).
    *   Severe [[Soft Tissue Injuries]].
*   **Iatrogenic/Medical Causes:**
    *   Prolonged or improper application of a **[[Tourniquet]]**.
    *   Neglected **[[Compartment Syndrome]]**.
    *   Prolonged immobilization (e.g., drug overdose, coma) leading to compression against a hard surface.
    *   [[Gas Gangrene]].

### Pathophysiology
The core pathology is **[[Myonecrosis]]** (muscle death) followed by **Reperfusion Injury**.

1.  **Compression Phase:** Prolonged pressure on the limb causes local ischemia and muscle death (myonecrosis).
2.  **Release Phase (Reperfusion):** Once the compressive force is removed, blood flow returns.
3.  **Washout of Toxins:** The toxic metabolites accumulated in the dead muscle are suddenly flushed into the systemic circulation.
4.  **Systemic Effects:**
    *   **[[Myoglobin]]**: Large molecules block the renal tubules, leading to **[[Acute Tubular Necrosis]]**.
    *   **[[Potassium]]**: Released from lysed cells, leading to **Hyperkalemia** (risk of cardiac arrest).
    *   **Acids**: Lactic acid and phosphates release lead to **[[Metabolic Acidosis]]**.
    *   **Fluid Sequestration**: Fluid rushes *into* the damaged limb (third-spacing), causing hypovolemic shock.

### Clinical Features
The presentation is often a triad of limb involvement, respiratory distress, and shock.

*   **Local Features:**
    *   The limb may appear swollen, tense, and bruised.
    *   Signs of [[Compartment Syndrome]] (Pain, Pallor, Paresthesia, Paralysis, Pulselessness).
    *   Skin may show blistering or necrosis.
*   **Systemic Features:**
    *   **Shock:** Hypovolemic shock due to fluid loss into the limb.
    *   **Urinary Changes:** Oliguria (low urine output) or Anuria. Urine may be dark reddish-brown (**Cola-colored**) due to [[Myoglobinuria]].
    *   **Cardiorespiratory:** Dyspnea, arrhythmias (due to hyperkalemia).

### Investigations

**Laboratory Findings:**

| Parameter | Finding | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Serum [[Creatine Kinase]] (CK)** | Massively Elevated | Marker of muscle breakdown |
| **Serum [[Potassium]]** | **Hyperkalemia** | Release of intracellular K+ |
| **Serum [[Calcium]]** | **Hypocalcemia** | Ca+ deposits in damaged muscle |
| **Serum Phosphate** | Hyperphosphatemia | Release from muscle cells |
| **ABG** | **[[Metabolic Acidosis]]** | Lactic acid accumulation |
| **Urine** | Positive for Myoglobin | Muscle breakdown product |

### Management

The goal is to prevent **[[Acute Renal Failure]]** and manage **[[Hyperkalemia]]**.

#### 1. Pre-hospital / Early Management
*   **Intravenous Fluids:** Establish IV access *before* releasing the crushing load if possible.
*   **Fluid Resuscitation:** This is the most critical step. High volume crystalloids to treat hypovolemia and induce diuresis.

#### 2. Hospital Management
*   **Fluid Therapy:** Continue aggressive hydration to maintain high urine output.
*   **Alkalinization of Urine:**
    *   Administration of **[[Sodium Bicarbonate]]**.
    *   **Rationale:** Myoglobin precipitates in the renal tubules in an acidic environment. Alkalinizing the urine prevents this precipitation and protects the kidneys.
*   **Electrolyte Correction:**
    *   Treat hyperkalemia aggressively (Calcium gluconate, Insulin/Dextrose).
    *   Treat hypocalcemia only if symptomatic (calcium can deposit in muscles).
*   **[[Dialysis]] (Hemodialysis):** Indicated if renal failure establishes (anuria/oliguria persists) or if hyperkalemia is refractory.

#### 3. Surgical Management
*   **[[Fasciotomy]]**: If there is established [[Compartment Syndrome]] threatening the limb survival.
*   **Amputation**: May be required if the limb is non-viable or if sepsis/severe metabolic toxicity threatens the patient's life.

### Complications
*   **[[Acute Renal Failure]]** (Major cause of death).
*   **[[Cardiac Arrhythmia]]** (Due to hyperkalemia).
*   **[[Sepsis]]**.
*   **[[Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation]] (DIC)**.

### Clinical Implications
*   **"Golden Hour"**: In mass casualty scenarios (earthquakes), fluid resuscitation must begin immediately. A patient appearing stable while trapped may rapidly deteriorate into cardiac arrest immediately upon release ("Rescue Death") due to the sudden influx of potassium.
*   **Do not delay:** High index of suspicion is needed. Do not wait for lab results to start fluids if the mechanism of injury suggests crush.

### Mnemonic for Metabolic Changes
**K-A-C-P** (Think of a "Kapped" Kidney)
*   **K** - **K**alemia (Hyper)
*   **A** - **A**cidosis (Metabolic)
*   **C** - **C**alcemia (Hypo)
*   **P** - **P**hosphatemia (Hyper)
