# [[Ear]] > Audiometry

### **Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA)**

**Definition and Principle**
*   **Definition:** A subjective test used to measure the threshold of hearing (auditory sensitivity) across a range of frequencies.
*   **Principle:** Uses pure tones generated electronically to determine the lowest intensity (threshold) at which a person can detect sound 50% of the time.
*   **AC (Air Conduction):** Tests the entire [[auditory pathway]] (external ear, middle ear, inner ear, and nerve). Measured via headphones/earphones.
*   **BC (Bone Conduction):** Bypasses the external and middle ear to stimulate the [[cochlea]] directly via a bone vibrator placed on the mastoid.

**Procedure and Parameters**
*   **Frequency Range:**
    *   AC tested from **125 Hz to 8000 Hz**.
    *   BC tested from **250 Hz to 4000 Hz**.
*   **Intensity:** Measured in **Decibels (dB)**.
    *   **0 dB HL (Hearing Level):** Represents the threshold of hearing for a normal healthy young adult.
*   **Method:** Modified Hughson-Westlake method (ascending method). Intensity is increased in 5 dB steps until heard, then decreased in 10 dB steps.

**Interpretation of Audiogram**

**1. Normal Hearing**
*   Both AC and BC thresholds are within **0–25 dB**.
*   No significant gap between AC and BC.

**2. Conductive Hearing Loss (CHL)**
*   **BC:** Normal (< 25 dB).
*   **AC:** Abnormal (> 25 dB).
*   **Air-Bone Gap (AB Gap):** **> 15 dB** (Significant gap present).
*   *Pathology:* Defect in external or [[middle ear]] (e.g., wax, perforation, ossicular fixation).

**3. Sensorineural Hearing Loss (SNHL)**
*   **BC:** Abnormal (> 25 dB).
*   **AC:** Abnormal (> 25 dB).
*   **Air-Bone Gap:** **< 15 dB** (No significant gap; AC and BC curves run close together).
*   *Pathology:* Defect in [[cochlea]] (sensory) or [[auditory nerve]] (neural).

**4. Mixed Hearing Loss**
*   **BC:** Abnormal (> 25 dB).
*   **AC:** Abnormal (> 25 dB).
*   **Air-Bone Gap:** **> 15 dB** (Gap is present).

**Specific Audiometric Patterns**
*   **Carhart’s Notch:** A dip in **Bone Conduction** at **2000 Hz** (2 kHz). Characteristic of [[Otosclerosis]].
    *   *Mechanism:* Loss of inertial bone conduction due to stapes fixation. Disappears after stapedectomy.
*   **Acoustic Dip (Boiler’s Notch):** A dip in AC and BC at **4000 Hz**. Characteristic of **Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL)** or early acoustic trauma.
*   **Cookie Bite / U-Shaped Curve:** Mid-frequency hearing loss. Suggestive of **Congenital SNHL** or cochlear otosclerosis.
*   **Down-sloping Curve:** High frequencies affected more. Seen in **Presbycusis** (age-related), Ototoxicity.
*   **Up-sloping Curve:** Low frequencies affected. Seen in early [[Meniere’s disease]] .

**Masking**
*   **Definition:** Introducing **narrow band noise** to the non-test ear to prevent it from hearing the sound meant for the test ear.
*   **Indication:**
    *   **AC:** When the difference between the two ears (AC of bad ear vs AC/BC of good ear) is **≥ 40 dB**.
    *   **BC:** Essential in almost all cases because interaural attenuation for bone conduction is 0 dB.
*   **Shadow Curve:** Without masking, a "shadow curve" of the better ear may appear on the audiogram of the deaf ear.

### **Speech Audiometry**

**Purpose:** Assesses the patient's ability to hear and *understand* speech, not just pure tones.

**1. Speech Reception Threshold (SRT)**
*   **Definition:** The minimum intensity at which **50%** of words are repeated correctly.
*   **Stimulus:** **Spondee words** (Bi-syllabic words with equal stress, e.g., "Cowboy", "Iceberg").
*   **Normal:** SRT should be within **10 dB** of the Pure Tone Average (average of 500, 1000, 2000 Hz).
*   **Clinical Implication:** If SRT is better than PTA by >10 dB, suspect **Functional Hearing Loss (Malingering)**.

**2. Speech Discrimination Score (SDS) / Word Recognition Score**
*   **Definition:** Measure of the ability to understand speech at comfortable loudness (usually 30–40 dB above SRT).
*   **Stimulus:** **Phonetically Balanced (PB) words** (Single syllable, e.g., "Pin", "Bus").
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   **90–100%:** Normal or Conductive Hearing Loss.
    *   **< 90%:** Sensorineural Hearing Loss (Cochlear).
    *   **Very Poor (< 50%):** Retrocochlear pathology (e.g., Acoustic Neuroma).
*   **Rollover Phenomenon:** In retrocochlear lesions, as speech intensity increases, the discrimination score paradoxically **decreases** due to nerve fatigue.

### **Impedance Audiometry**

**Principle:** Objective test measuring the compliance (mobility) of the tympano-ossicular system and middle ear pressure. Consists of Tympanometry and Acoustic Reflex.

**1. Tympanometry**
*   **Definition:** Graph of compliance vs. pressure in the ear canal.
*   **Probe Tone:** 220 Hz or 226 Hz. (1000 Hz used for infants < 6 months).

| **Type** | **Graph Shape** | **Compliance** | **Clinical Condition** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type A** | Peak at 0 daPa | Normal | Normal Middle Ear |
| **Type As** | Peak at 0 daPa | **Reduced (Shallow)** | **Otosclerosis** ("s" for stiffness/sclerosis) |
| **Type Ad** | Peak at 0 daPa | **High (Deep)** | **Ossicular Discontinuity** ("d" for deep/discontinuity) |
| **Type B** | **Flat / Dome** | No Peak | **Fluid (OME)**, **TM Perforation** |
| **Type C** | Peak at negative pressure | Normal | **Eustachian Tube Dysfunction**, Retracted TM |

**2. Acoustic Reflex (Stapedial Reflex)**
*   **Mechanism:** Loud sound (>70–100 dB above threshold) causes bilateral contraction of the [[stapedius muscle]] via the Facial Nerve (CN VII).
*   **Reflex Arc:** CN VIII (Afferent) $\rightarrow$ Cochlear Nucleus $\rightarrow$ Superior Olivary Complex $\rightarrow$ CN VII Nucleus $\rightarrow$ Stapedius Muscle (Efferent).
*   **Clinical Implications:**
    *   **Recruitment:** In cochlear lesions (e.g., Meniere's), reflex is present at lower thresholds (< 60 dB above threshold).
    *   **Reflex Decay:** Amplitude drops by 50% within 10 seconds. Sign of **Retrocochlear lesion** (CN VIII tumor).
    *   **Facial Nerve Palsy:** Absent reflex helps localize lesion proximal to the nerve to stapedius.
    *   **Malingering:** If reflex is present in a "deaf" ear, the patient is malingering.

### **Special & Objective Tests**

#### **1. Tests for Recruitment (Cochlear Pathology)**
*Recruitment is the abnormal growth of loudness (soft sounds not heard, loud sounds intolerant).*
*   **SISI (Short Increment Sensitivity Index):** Ability to detect 1 dB increment. Score >70% = **Cochlear pathology** (Positive Recruitment).
*   **ABLB (Alternate Binaural Loudness Balance):** Compares loudness between good and bad ear. Detects recruitment in unilateral cases.

#### **2. Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE)**
*   **Source:** Sounds generated by the **Outer Hair Cells (OHC)** of the cochlea.
*   **Types:**
    *   **TEOAE (Transient Evoked):** Broadband click stimulus. Best for **Neonatal Screening**.
    *   **DPOAE (Distortion Product):** Frequency specific. Used for monitoring **Ototoxicity** and **Noise Induced Hearing Loss**.
*   **Implication:**
    *   **Present:** Normal cochlea (Outer Hair Cells intact).
    *   **Absent:** Cochlear damage (>30 dB hearing loss).
    *   **Present + Abnormal ABR:** **Auditory Neuropathy**.

#### **3. Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry (BERA / ABR)**
*   **Principle:** Records electrical potentials from the auditory nerve and brainstem in response to clicks.
*   **Waves (ECOLI Mnemonic):**
    *   **I:** Eighth Nerve (Distal)
    *   **II:** Eighth Nerve (Proximal)
    *   **III:** **C**ochlear Nucleus
    *   **IV:** Superior **O**livary Complex
    *   **V:** **L**ateral Lemniscus (Largest and most important wave)
    *   **VI & VII:** **I**nferior Colliculus.
*   **Clinical Uses:**
    *   **Threshold Estimation:** In infants/difficult-to-test patients (Wave V used).
    *   **Retrocochlear Pathology:** Interaural Wave V latency difference **> 0.2 ms** suggests **Acoustic Neuroma** (Vestibular Schwannoma).
    *   **Screening:** For high-risk neonates (NICU).

#### **4. Electrocochleography (ECochG)**
*   **Measures:** Electrical potentials (SP - Summating Potential, AP - Action Potential) from the cochlea.
*   **Diagnostic:** **Meniere's Disease**. SP/AP ratio is elevated (**> 30–45%**).

#### **5. Auditory Steady State Response (ASSR)**
*   **Use:** Objective PTA. Can estimate severe to profound hearing loss **(> 80-90 dB)** where BERA waves are absent. Good for cochlear implant candidates.

### **Pediatric Hearing Assessment**

*   **Neonatal Screening:**
    *   **OAE:** First-line screen (Fast, non-invasive).
    *   **BERA:** For high-risk babies (NICU) or those who fail OAE.
*   **Behavioral Tests:**
    *   **BOA (Behavioral Observation Audiometry):** < 6 months. Observe startle/blink.
    *   **VRA (Visual Reinforcement Audiometry):** 6 months – 2 years. Head turn rewarded by visual toy.
    *   **Play Audiometry:** 2 – 5 years. Conditioned to perform a task (e.g., put block in box) upon hearing sound.
