# [[Diseases Of Retina]] > Central Retinal Vein Occlusion

# [[Central Retinal Vein Occlusion]] (CRVO)

**CRVO** is a vascular disorder of the retina characterized by the blockage of the central retinal vein, leading to back-pressure changes, hemorrhage, and ischemia in the retina. It is the second most common retinal vascular disease after diabetic retinopathy.

## Etiopathogenesis
The occlusion usually occurs at the level of the **[[Lamina Cribrosa]]**, where the central retinal vein shares a common adventitial sheath with the central retinal artery.
*   **Mechanism:** Sclerosis of the adjacent central retinal artery compresses the vein, leading to turbulent flow, endothelial damage, and thrombus formation.
*   **Virchow's Triad:** Factors contributing to thrombosis include slowing of the blood stream, changes in the vessel wall, and changes in the blood (hypercoagualability).

### Risk Factors
*   **Systemic:**
    *   **Hypertension** (Most common/significant risk factor).,
    *   [[Diabetes Mellitus]].
    *   Hyperviscosity syndromes (Polycythemia, Leukemia, Multiple Myeloma).,
    *   Hyperhomocysteinemia.
*   **Ocular:**
    *   Primary Open Angle [[Glaucoma]] (Raised IOP compromises venous outflow).,
    *   Hypermetropia.
    *   Vasculitis/Periphlebitis (e.g., [[Sarcoidosis]], [[Behcet's Disease]]).

## Classification
CRVO is broadly classified into two distinct clinical types based on the degree of retinal ischemia:
1.  **Non-Ischemic CRVO** (Venous Stasis Retinopathy): Milder form, accounts for ~75% of cases.,
2.  **Ischemic CRVO** (Hemorrhagic Retinopathy): Severe form, accounts for ~25% of cases.

### Clinical Features and Comparison

**Presentation:**
*   **Non-Ischemic:** Sudden, unilateral, mild to moderate blurring of vision. Often worse upon waking.
*   **Ischemic:** Sudden, unilateral, **profound** painless loss of vision.,

**Fundus Examination ("Tomato-Splash" Appearance):**
The classic fundus appearance in severe cases resembles a **"Splashed Tomato"** or **"Tomato Ketchup"** fundus due to massive hemorrhages.,,

### Differentiating Ischemic vs. Non-Ischemic CRVO

| Feature | Non-Ischemic CRVO (Venous Stasis) | Ischemic CRVO (Hemorrhagic) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Visual Acuity** | Better (usually > 6/60) | Poor (usually < 6/60, often CF or HM) |
| **[[Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect]] (RAPD)** | **Absent** or very mild | **Present** (Marked), |
| **Visual Fields** | Minimal defects | Extensive defects |
| **Venous Changes** | Mild dilatation and tortuosity | Massive engorgement and tortuosity |
| **Retinal Hemorrhages** | Mostly superficial, mild to moderate | Massive, deep and superficial involving whole fundus |
| **[[Cotton Wool Spots]]** | Rare or Few | **Numerous** (usually > 10) |
| **Macular Edema** | Present (Chronic cystoid edema) | Severe, often hemorrhagic |
| **[[Fundus Fluorescein Angiography]] (FFA)** | Good retinal capillary perfusion | Extensive areas of **Capillary Non-Perfusion (CNP)** (> 10 disc areas), |
| **[[Electroretinogram]] (ERG)** | Normal or slightly reduced b-wave | **Reduced amplitude of b-wave** (Prognostic sign) |
| **Prognosis** | Better (50% return to normal vision) | Poor (Risk of Neovascular Glaucoma) |

## Complications

1.  **[[Cystoid Macular Edema]] (CME):** The most common cause of visual loss in non-ischemic CRVO.
2.  **[[Neovascular Glaucoma]] (NVG):**
    *   Also known as **"100-Day Glaucoma"** or **"90-Day Glaucoma"**.,
    *   Occurs in ~20% of ischemic cases, typically within 3 months of occlusion.
    *   Due to retinal ischemia $\rightarrow$ VEGF release $\rightarrow$ [[Rubeosis Iridis]] (NVI) $\rightarrow$ Angle Neovascularization $\rightarrow$ Intractable Glaucoma.,
3.  **Vitreous Hemorrhage:** From neovascularization elsewhere (NVE) or neovascularization of the disc (NVD).
4.  **Proliferative Retinopathy.**

## Investigations

1.  **[[Fundus Fluorescein Angiography]] (FFA):**
    *   **Gold Standard** to differentiate ischemic from non-ischemic types.
    *   Non-ischemic: Delayed AV transit time, good perfusion, late leakage.
    *   Ischemic: Marked capillary non-perfusion (CNP) areas (>10 disc diameters).
2.  **[[Optical Coherence Tomography]] (OCT):**
    *   To evaluate and quantify **Macular Edema** and subretinal fluid.
3.  **Electroretinogram (ERG):**
    *   Reduced b-wave amplitude indicates ischemia.
4.  **Systemic Workup:**
    *   BP, Blood Sugar, Lipid profile, CBC (viscosity), Homocysteine levels (in young patients).

## Management

The goal is to treat complications (Macular edema, Neovascularization) and systemic risk factors.

### 1. Medical Management (Primary Treatment)
*   **Anti-VEGF Agents:**
    *   Drugs: **[[Ranibizumab]]**, **[[Bevacizumab]]**, **[[Aflibercept]]**.,
    *   Mechanism: Reduces macular edema and causes regression of neovascularization.
    *   Indication: Macular edema, Neovascularization.
*   **Intravitreal Steroids:**
    *   **[[Triamcinolone Acetonide]]**.,
    *   **Dexamethasone Implant ([[Ozurdex]]):** Slow-release implant effective for macular edema (Geneva study).,
*   **Systemic Control:** Management of HTN, DM, Dyslipidemia.

### 2. Laser Therapy
*   **[[Panretinal Photocoagulation]] (PRP):**
    *   **Indication:** Essential for **Ischemic CRVO** with neovascularization (NVI, NVD, NVE) to prevent Neovascular Glaucoma.,,
    *   *Note:* Grid laser is **NOT** recommended for macular edema in CRVO (unlike in BRVO or Diabetic Retinopathy).

### 3. Surgical Management
*   **Pars Plana Vitrectomy:** Indicated for non-clearing [[Vitreous Hemorrhage]].

### Clinical Implication: Monitoring
Patients, especially with non-ischemic CRVO, must be monitored regularly because ~15% can convert to ischemic CRVO within 4 months.
