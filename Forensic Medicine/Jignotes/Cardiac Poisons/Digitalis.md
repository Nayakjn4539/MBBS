# [[Cardiac Poisons]] > Digitalis

### Digitalis (Foxglove)

**Digitalis** refers to a group of [[cardiac glycosides]] derived from the Foxglove plant. While therapeutically used for congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation, it has a narrow therapeutic index, making toxicity a significant medical and forensic concern.

#### 1. Source and Active Principles
*   **Botanical Name:** *Digitalis purpurea* (Purple Foxglove) and *Digitalis lanata* (White Foxglove).
*   **Appearance:** > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Illustration of Foxglove plant showing bell-shaped tubular flowers (pink/purple/white) and ovate, hairy leaves.
*   **Toxic Parts:** All parts are poisonous, but **leaves** and seeds are the most toxic.
*   **Active Principles:**
    *   **Digitoxin**
    *   **Digitalin**
    *   **Digitonin**
    *   **Digoxin** (mainly from *D. lanata*)

#### 2. Mechanism of Action
*   **Inhibition of [[Na+-K+ ATPase pump]]:** This leads to an increase in intracellular sodium, which in turn increases intracellular calcium via the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger.
*   **Result:**
    *   Increased myocardial contractility (positive inotropic).
    *   Increased excitability of cardiac muscle (bathmotropic).
    *   Decreased conduction velocity (negative dromotropic).
    *   Increased vagal tone.

#### 3. Clinical Features (Signs and Symptoms)
Toxicity manifests differently in acute vs. chronic poisoning.

**A. Acute Poisoning**
*   **Gastrointestinal (Earliest signs):** Anorexia, severe nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.
*   **Metabolic:** [[Hyperkalemia]] (Serum K+ > 5.0 mEq/L is a key indicator of severe acute toxicity and poor prognosis).
*   **Cardiovascular:**
    *   Any arrhythmia is possible *except* rapid atrial conduction.
    *   Most common: Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs).
    *   Severe: Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), Ventricular Fibrillation (VF), Heart blocks (SA/AV node block).

**B. Chronic Poisoning (Therapeutic Overdose)**
*   **Electrolytes:** usually associated with **Hypokalemia** (precipitating factor).
*   **Visual Disturbances:**
    *   **Xanthopsia** (Yellow-green vision).
    *   "Snowy" vision or halos around lights.
    *   [[Toxic amblyopia]].
*   **CNS:** Confusion, delirium, drowsiness, headache, fatigue.
*   **Other:** Gynecomastia (estrogen-like effect with long-term use).
*   **Ocular:** **[[Hippus]]** (alternate dilation and constriction of pupils) may be observed.

#### 4. Fatal Dose and Fatal Period
| Substance | Fatal Dose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Digitalis Leaf** | ~ 2 grams |
| **Digitoxin** | 4 mg |
| **Digoxin** | 10 - 15 mg |
| **Digitalin** | 15 - 30 mg |

*   **Fatal Period:** 1 to 24 hours (usually death is delayed).

#### 5. Diagnosis
*   **ECG Changes:**
    *   "Hockey-stick" appearance or scooping of the ST-segment (Therapeutic effect, not necessarily toxic).
    *   Prolonged PR interval.
    *   Shortened QT interval.
*   **Serum Levels:** Serum digoxin level > 2 ng/mL (toxic range).
*   **Electrolytes:** Serum Potassium levels.

#### 6. Treatment
**A. Decontamination**
*   **Stomach wash:** With water or tannic acid (precipitates alkaloid).
*   **[[Activated Charcoal]]:** Single dose or multi-dose to interrupt enterohepatic circulation.
*   **Cathartics:** To hasten evacuation.

**B. Specific Antidote**
*   **[[Digoxin-specific antibody fragments]] (Fab) / Digibind:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Binds free digoxin in blood, creating a concentration gradient that pulls digoxin out of tissues.
    *   **Indications:**
        *   Life-threatening arrhythmias (VT/VF).
        *   Hyperkalemia (> 5.5 mEq/L).
        *   Ingestion of > 10 mg in adults or > 4 mg in children.
    *   **Dose:** Usually **10 to 20 vials** for acute poisoning. (Each vial binds approx 0.5 mg digoxin).

**C. Symptomatic Management**
*   **Hyperkalemia:** Treat with Insulin + Dextrose. **Avoid Calcium Gluconate** (can cause "stone heart" or irreversible contraction).
*   **Bradycardia:** **[[Atropine]]** (0.6 mg IV).
*   **Ventricular Arrhythmias:**
    *   **[[Phenytoin]]** (Dilantin): Drug of choice for digitalis-induced arrhythmias (reverses AV block).
    *   **[[Lidocaine]]**: Alternative for ventricular irritability.
    *   **Magnesium sulfate:** For hypomagnesemia.
*   **Avoid:** DC Cardioversion (can precipitate asystole/VF).

#### 7. Autopsy Findings
*   There are no pathognomonic anatomical findings.
*   Findings are generally those of **asphyxia** and venous congestion.
*   Parts of the plant (leaves/seeds) may be found in the stomach.
*   Chemical analysis of viscera is required for confirmation.

#### 8. Medico-legal Aspects
*   **Accidental:** Most common form, arising from therapeutic overdose (narrow therapeutic index) or children eating plant parts/seeds.
*   **Suicidal:** Occasional cases reported.
*   **Homicidal:** Rare due to bitter taste and delayed action, though historically used.
*   **Quackery:** Poisoning may result from use in folk medicine.
