# [[ENVIRONMENT & HEALTH]] > Mention the characteristics of safe & wholesome water. Classify water borne diseases. Briefly discuss the three methods for water purification at household level.

### Safe and Wholesome Water

Water intended for human consumption must meet specific criteria to be considered **Safe and Wholesome**. It is not just about purity (chemically pure water like distilled water is not necessarily wholesome), but about safety and acceptability.

**Characteristics:**
1.  **Pathogen Free:** It must be free from [[pathogenic agents]] (bacteria, viruses, protozoa, helminths).
2.  **Chemical Safety:** It must be free from harmful chemical substances (e.g., arsenic, lead, excessive fluoride).
3.  **Acceptability:** It must be pleasant to the taste, free from color, and odorless.
4.  **Usability:** It must be usable for domestic purposes (e.g., cooking, washing).

> **Clinical Relevance:** Water is said to be **polluted** or **contaminated** if it does not fulfill the above criteria. Provision of safe water is a fundamental intervention in [[Primary Health Care]].

### Classification of Water-Borne Diseases

Public health classifies water-related diseases based on the **mechanism of transmission** rather than the type of organism. This is crucial for determining control strategies.

**The "WWWW" Classification**

| Category | Mechanism | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Water Borne** | Caused by **ingesting** contaminated water (Faeco-oral route). | • **Viral:** [[Hepatitis A]], [[Hepatitis E]], Poliomyelitis, Rotavirus <br>• **Bacterial:** [[Cholera]], [[Typhoid]], Bacillary Dysentery <br>• **Protozoal:** Amoebiasis, Giardiasis |
| **2. Water Washed** | Caused by **lack of water** for personal hygiene (inadequate quantity). Infections of skin and eyes. | • **Skin:** [[Scabies]], Fungal infections <br>• **Eye:** [[Community Medicine/Jignotes/COMMUNICABLE DISEASES/Trachoma]], Conjunctivitis |
| **3. Water Based** | Pathogen spends a part of its life cycle in an **aquatic intermediate host** (e.g., Snail, Cyclops). | • [[Schistosomiasis]] (Snail) <br>• [[Dracunculiasis]] / Guinea worm (Cyclops) |
| **4. Water Related** | Spread by **insect vectors** that breed in or near water. | • **Mosquitoes:** [[Malaria]], [[Dengue]], Filariasis, Yellow Fever, JE <br>• **Flies:** Onchocerciasis (River blindness), Sleeping sickness (Tsetse fly near water) |

> **Mnemonic for Water Washed Diseases:** **"The Scab Washes the Track"**
> *   **Scab** = [[Scabies]]
> *   **Washes** = Water Washed
> *   **Track** = [[Community Medicine/Jignotes/COMMUNICABLE DISEASES/Trachoma]]

### Methods for Water Purification at Household Level

There are three main methods generally available for purifying water on an individual or domestic scale.

#### 1. Boiling
This is the most satisfactory method for household purification.
*   **Method:** Water must be brought to a **"rolling boil"** for **10 to 20 minutes**.
*   **Mechanism:** It kills all bacteria, spores, cysts, and ova. It creates sterilized water.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Removes **temporary hardness** (drives off CO2 and precipitates Calcium Carbonate).
    *   Simple and effective.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   **Taste:** Altered (flat) because dissolved gases are expelled. (Shake the water to reaerate and restore taste).
    *   **No Residual Effect:** It offers no protection against subsequent [[microbial contamination]] during storage.

> **Clinical Relevance:** Boiling is the method of choice during water-borne epidemics (e.g., Cholera) but requires fuel and does not protect against re-contamination if stored in dirty vessels.

#### 2. Chemical Disinfection
Chemicals are used to oxidize and kill pathogens.
*   **A. Chlorine Tablets:**
    *   Commercially available as **Halazone tablets**.
    *   Good for small quantities (e.g., camping, travel).
    *   **NEERI formulation:** Newer tablets are 15 times better than ordinary halazone. A single 0.5 g tablet disinfects **20 liters** of water.
*   **B. Bleaching Powder:**
    *   **Chlorine Solution:** Prepared from bleaching powder. roughly 4kg of bleaching powder (25% available chlorine) in 20L water makes a 5% stock solution.
    *   **[[High Test Hypochlorite]] (HTH):** Or Perchloron. Contains 60-70% available chlorine. More stable than bleaching powder.
*   **C. Iodine:**
    *   Used for emergency disinfection.
    *   2 drops of 2% ethanol solution of iodine per liter of water.
    *   **Contact time:** 20 to 30 minutes.
    *   *Note:* High cost and physiological activity (thyroid) limit routine use.
*   **D. Potassium Permanganate:**
    *   **Not recommended** anymore. It may kill Cholera vibrios but is useless against other organisms. It alters color, smell, and taste.

#### 3. Filtration
Water can be purified using ceramic filters.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Pasteur Chamberland Filter:** Porcelain candle.
    *   **Berkefeld Filter:** Kieselguhr (infusorial earth) candle.
    *   **[[Katadyn Filter]]:** Coated with a silver catalyst (oligodynamic action) which kills bacteria.
*   **Mechanism:** Mechanical straining through micropores.
*   **Maintenance:** The "candle" (essential part) gets clogged with impurities/bacteria. It must be scrubbed with a hard brush under running water and boiled at least once a week.
*   **Limitation:** While they remove bacteria, coarse filters may **not remove viruses**.
