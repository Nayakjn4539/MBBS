## Classification of Conjunctival Tumors

The tumors of the [[conjunctiva]] can be broadly classified based on pigmentation and malignant potential.

| Category | Type | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Non-Pigmented** | **Congenital** | [[Limbal Dermoid]], [[Lipodermoid]] (Choristomas) |
| | **Benign** | [[Papilloma]], Simple [[Granuloma]], Fibroma, Angioma |
| | **Pre-Malignant** | Intraepithelial epithelioma (Bowen's disease/CIN) |
| | **Malignant** | [[Squamous Cell Carcinoma]] (SCC), [[Basal Cell Carcinoma]] |
| **Pigmented** | **Benign** | [[Conjunctival Naevus]] (Congenital moles) |
| | **Pre-Cancerous** | Primary Acquired Melanosis (PAM) / Precancerous Melanosis |
| | **Malignant** | [[Malignant Melanoma]] |

## Non-Pigmented Tumors

### 1. Congenital Tumors (Choristomas)
Choristomas are congenital overgrowths of normal tissue in an abnormal location.

#### A. Epibulbar Dermoid (Limbal Dermoid)
*   **Appearance:** Solid, smooth, yellowish-white, round/oval mass.
*   **Location:** Usually at the [[limbus]], most commonly in the **inferotemporal quadrant**.
*   **Histology:** Covered by epidermoid epithelium; contains collagenous connective tissue, sebaceous glands, and hair follicles.
*   **Clinical Significance:**
    *   Can encroach onto the [[cornea]] affecting vision (astigmatism or visual axis blockage).
    *   **Association:** [[Goldenhar Syndrome]] (Oculo-auriculo-vertebral dysplasia).
        *   **Triad:** [[Epibulbar dermoids]] + Preauricular appendages/fistulas + Vertebral anomalies.
*   **Treatment:** Surgical excision (lamellar keratectomy) if causing cosmetic deformity or visual impairment.

#### B. Lipodermoid (Dermolipoma)
*   **Appearance:** Soft, yellowish-white, movable subconjunctival mass.
*   **Location:** Usually at the **superotemporal quadrant** (outer canthus) or fornix.
*   **Composition:** Fatty tissue surrounded by dermis-like connective tissue.
*   **Treatment:** Conservative (usually left alone). Excision is difficult due to posterior extension and relation to extraocular muscles.

### 2. Benign Tumors

#### A. Papilloma
*   **Squamous Papilloma:**
    *   **Etiology:** Often viral ([[Human Papilloma Virus]] - HPV 6, 11).
    *   **Appearance:** Raspberry-like (mulberry), pedunculated or sessile growth.
    *   **Location:** Fornices, caruncle, or limbus.
    *   **Treatment:** Surgical excision or cryotherapy.

#### B. Simple Granuloma
*   **Appearance:** Polypoid, cauliflower-like fungating mass of granulation tissue.
*   **Etiology:** Post-surgical (e.g., after [[squint surgery]] or [[pterygium surgery]]), retained foreign body, or inadequately scraped [[chalazion]].
*   **Treatment:** Surgical removal.

### 3. Ocular Surface Squamous Neoplasia (OSSN)
OSSN is a spectrum of dysplastic changes involving the epithelium of the conjunctiva, cornea, and limbus. It ranges from dysplasia to invasive carcinoma.

#### Spectrum of OSSN
1.  **Conjunctival Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN):** Dysplasia confined to the epithelium with an **intact basement membrane**. (Previously called Carcinoma-in-situ or Bowen’s disease).
2.  **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC):** Neoplastic cells breach the basement membrane and invade the underlying [[substantia propria]].

#### Risk Factors
*   Ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure (Sunlight).
*   [[Human Papilloma Virus]] (HPV) type 16 and 18.
*   [[HIV]]/AIDS.
*   Xeroderma pigmentosum.
*   Heavy smoking.

#### Clinical Presentation
OSSN usually arises at the **limbus** (transitional zone) particularly in the interpalpebral area. It may present in three morphological forms:
1.  **Gelatinous form:** Ill-defined, translucent, elevated mass (Most common).
2.  **Leukoplakic form:** White, hyperkeratotic plaque (White patch).
3.  **Papillomatous form:** Vascular, soft mass.

*   **Feeder Vessels:** Prominent nutrient vessels are often seen supplying the tumor.

#### Treatment of OSSN
*   **Surgical Excision:** "No touch" technique with wide safety margins (2–4 mm).
*   **Adjuvant Therapy:** To prevent recurrence:
    *   **Cryotherapy:** Applied to the cut edges of the conjunctiva (double freeze-thaw cycle).
    *   **Topical Chemotherapy:** [[Mitomycin C]] (0.02%–0.04%), 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), or Interferon alpha-2b.
*   **Advanced Cases:** Enucleation or [[exenteration]] if the globe or orbit is extensively invaded.

## Pigmented Tumors

### 1. Conjunctival Naevus (Benign)
*   **Definition:** Congenital hamartoma comprising nests of melanocytes.
*   **Presentation:**
    *   Appears in early childhood (first two decades).
    *   Flat or slightly raised, grey/brown nodule.
    *   **Location:** Commonly near the limbus or plica semilunaris.
*   **Key Diagnostic Feature:** Presence of **cysts** within the lesion helps distinguish it from melanoma.
*   **Malignant Potential:** Rare (<1%), indicated by sudden growth or increased pigmentation or vascularity.
*   **Treatment:** Observation; Excision for cosmetic reasons.

### 2. Primary Acquired Melanosis (PAM)
*   **Definition:** Acquired, flat, diffuse pigmentation developing in middle-aged/elderly adults (mostly whites).
*   **Types:**
    1.  **PAM without atypia:** Benign.
    2.  **PAM with atypia:** 50% risk of progression to malignant melanoma.
*   **Appearance:** Unilateral, flat, brown patches with irregular margins ("peppered" appearance).

### 3. Malignant Melanoma
*   **Origin:**
    *   De-novo (Most common).
    *   From pre-existing [[naevus]].
    *   From [[Primary Acquired Melanosis]] (PAM).
*   **Location:** Limbus (commonest), caruncle, or forniceal conjunctiva.
*   **Features:**
    *   Elevated, nodular, or polypoid mass.
    *   Usually pigmented (black/brown) but can be amelanotic (non-pigmented).
    *   **Vascularity:** Highly vascular; large "feeder vessels" are present.
    *   Fixation to underlying sclera indicates invasion.
*   **Metastasis:** Spreads via lymphatics (preauricular/submandibular nodes) and blood (liver).
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Wide Excisional Biopsy:** With cryotherapy to margins ("No touch" technique).
    *   **Enucleation/Exenteration:** Required for extensive disease or orbital invasion.

## Other Important Tumors

### 1. Kaposi Sarcoma
*   **Association:** Pathognomonic of [[AIDS]] (HIV infection).
*   **Appearance:** Bright red or bluish-red (violaceous) vascular nodule on the bulbar or palpebral conjunctiva.
*   **Mimics:** Can look like a subconjunctival hemorrhage but is elevated.
*   **Treatment:** Radiotherapy, excision, or systemic treatment of AIDS.

### 2. Lymphoma
*   **Appearance:** "Salmon-patch" lesion (fleshy, pinkish mass).
*   **Location:** Often in the fornix.
*   **Nature:** Usually Non-Hodgkin’s B-cell lymphoma. Can be a manifestation of systemic lymphoma.

### Important Differentiating Features

| Feature | **Pterygium** | **OSSN (Squamous Cell Ca)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Appearance** | Triangular, fibrovascular growth | Gelatinous, leukoplakic, or papillomatous |
| **Vascularity** | Vessels run parallel towards apex | Feeder vessels, irregular corkscrew pattern |
| **Probe Test** | Probe **cannot** be passed underneath (adherent) | N/A (Solid mass) |
| **Site** | Usually Nasal | Usually Limbal (Interpalpebral) |

> **Clinical Implication:** Any conjunctival lesion that grows rapidly, changes color, bleeds, or has prominent feeder vessels should be biopsied to rule out malignancy.
