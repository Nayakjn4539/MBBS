# Pes Cavus (High Arched Foot)

**Definition**
[[Pes Cavus]] is a foot deformity characterized by an abnormally high **medial longitudinal arch**. It is the opposite of [[Pes Planus]] (flat foot). In this condition, the foot is fixed in **plantar flexion** (equinus) of the forefoot in relation to the hindfoot. It is frequently associated with **clawing of the toes** and **varus deformity** of the heel.

### Etiology and Classification
Unlike flat foot, which is often physiological, **Pes Cavus** is almost always pathological. It is crucial to identify the underlying cause, which is predominantly **neuromuscular**.

**Causes can be classified as:**

1.  **Neuromuscular (Most Common)**
    *   **Hereditary Motor Sensory Neuropathy (HMSN):** Specifically [[Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease]] (Type I and II). This is the single most common identifiable cause.
    *   **Spinal Cord Lesions:** [[Spina Bifida]], [[Syringomyelia]], [[Spinal Dysraphism]], [[Diastematomyelia]], Spinal cord tumors.
    *   **Cerebellar Disorders:** [[Friedreich's Ataxia]].
    *   **Anterior Horn Cell Disorders:** [[Poliomyelitis]], [[Spinal Muscular Atrophy]].
    *   **Upper Motor Neuron Lesions:** [[Cerebral Palsy]].

2.  **Congenital:** Rare; e.g., Residual [[Clubfoot]] (Talipes Equinovarus).
3.  **Traumatic:** Malunion of [[calcaneal fractures]] or [[talus fractures]]; Compartment syndrome of the foot.
4.  **Idiopathic:** When no neurological cause is found (diagnosis of exclusion).

*   **Mnemonic for Causes: "CAVUS"**
    *   **C**harcot-Marie-Tooth
    *   **A**taxia (Friedreich’s)
    *   **V**oluntary (rare/hysterical) or Viral (Polio)
    *   **U**nderlying spinal defect (Spina Bifida)
    *   **S**yringomyelia

### Pathomechanism
The deformity usually results from a **muscle imbalance** between the agonist and antagonist muscle groups.
*   **Intrinsic Muscle Paralysis:** Weakness of the [[intrinsic muscles]] (lumbricals and interossei) leads to the inability to flex the MCP joints and extend the IP joints.
*   **Overactive Extrinsics:** The long extensors hyperextend the MCP joints, and the long flexors flex the IP joints, leading to **claw toes**.
*   **Plantar Fascia Contracture:** The [[plantar fascia]] shortens, pulling the forefoot towards the hindfoot, further raising the arch.
*   **First Metatarsal Depression:** A strong [[peroneus longus]] relative to a weak [[tibialis anterior]] depresses the first metatarsal, driving the forefoot into pronation and forcing the hindfoot into **varus** to compensate.

### Clinical Features
*   **Deformity:** High medial arch, visible even when weight-bearing. The foot appears short and thick.
*   **Claw Toes:** Hyperextension at MTP joints and flexion at PIP/DIP joints.
*   **Callosities:** Painful [[calluses]] often develop under the metatarsal heads (especially the 1st and 5th) due to uneven weight distribution.
*   **Metatarsalgia:** Pain in the forefoot is a common complaint.
*   **Instability:** Frequent **ankle sprains** due to the [[varus heel]] and rigid foot structure.
*   **Shoe Wear:** Difficulty fitting into standard shoes due to the high instep and claw toes.

**Clinical Implication:**
> In any patient presenting with **bilateral** Pes Cavus, a full neurological examination (including spine MRI) is mandatory to rule out spinal dysraphism or hereditary neuropathies. Unilateral cases are often post-traumatic or post-polio.

### Clinical Examination
1.  **Look:** Inspect the high arch, claw toes, and callus formation. Look for **varus heel** from behind (peek-a-boo heel sign).
2.  **Feel:** Check for tenderness over the metatarsal heads and plantar fascia. Assess sensation (to rule out neuropathy).
3.  **Move:** Assess the flexibility of the hindfoot.
4.  **Special Test: [[Coleman Block Test]]**
    *   **Purpose:** To distinguish between a flexible (forefoot-driven) hindfoot varus and a rigid hindfoot varus.
    *   **Method:** The patient stands with the heel and lateral border of the foot on a wooden block (2.5 cm thick), allowing the **first metatarsal to hang free** off the edge.
    *   **Interpretation:**
        *   If the **hindfoot varus corrects** to valgus/neutral: The deformity is driven by the plantarflexed first ray (forefoot driven).
        *   If the **hindfoot varus persists**: The hindfoot deformity is fixed/rigid.

### Radiological Features
*   **Weight-bearing Lateral X-ray:**
    *   **[[Meary’s Angle]] (Talo-1st Metatarsal Angle):** Normally, the axis of the talus lines up with the first metatarsal (0°). In Pes Cavus, the angle is increased (apex dorsal) > 4°.
    *   **[[Calcaneal Pitch]]:** Increased angle (indicating a vertical calcaneus).
    *   **Hibbs Angle:** Angle between the calcaneus and the first metatarsal is decreased (<150°).

### Treatment
Treatment depends on the severity, flexibility of the deformity, and whether the underlying condition is progressive.

#### 1. Conservative Management
Indicated for mild, flexible deformities or patients unfit for surgery.
*   **Custom Orthotics:** Total contact insole with **arch support** to redistribute weight.
*   **Metatarsal Bar/Pad:** To unload painful metatarsal heads.
*   **Footwear:** Wide toe-box shoes to accommodate claw toes; extra-depth shoes.
*   **Physical Therapy:** Stretching of the [[Achilles tendon]] and plantar fascia.

#### 2. Surgical Management
Indicated for severe pain, instability, progressive deformity, or failure of conservative care.

**A. Soft Tissue Procedures (For Flexible Deformities)**
*   **[[Plantar Fasciotomy]]:** Release of the tight plantar fascia (Steindler stripping).
*   **Tendon Transfers:** To restore muscle balance.
    *   **Jones Transfer:** Transfer of [[Extensor Hallucis Longus]] (EHL) to the neck of the first metatarsal (corrects clawing of the big toe and elevates the dropped metatarsal).
    *   **Girdlestone-Taylor Procedure:** Flexor-to-extensor transfer for lesser toe clawing.
    *   **Peroneus Longus to Brevis transfer:** If the first ray is plantarflexed.

**B. Bony Procedures (For Rigid/Fixed Deformities)**
*   **Osteotomies:**
    *   **Metatarsal Osteotomy:** Dorsal wedge osteotomy to correct the plantarflexed first ray.
    *   **[[Calcaneal Osteotomy]]:** (e.g., Dwyer’s osteotomy) lateral closing wedge to correct heel varus.
    *   **Midfoot Osteotomy:** (e.g., Japas V-osteotomy) to correct the high arch apex.
*   **[[Triple Arthrodesis]]:**
    *   Fusion of the Subtalar, Calcaneocuboid, and Talonavicular joints.
    *   **Indication:** Severe, rigid, painful deformity in a mature foot (Salvage procedure).
