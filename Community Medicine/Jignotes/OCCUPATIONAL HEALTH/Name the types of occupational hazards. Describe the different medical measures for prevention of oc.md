# [[OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH]] > Name the types of occupational hazards. Describe the different medical measures for prevention of occupational disease.

# Types of Occupational Hazards

An industrial worker may be exposed to five types of hazards depending upon their occupation. These are broadly classified as follows:

| Type of Hazard | Agents/Causes | Associated Diseases/Effects |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. [[Physical Hazards]]** | **Heat & Cold** | Heat stroke, heat cramps, burns, frostbite, chilblains. |
| | **Light** | Occupational cataract, miner's nystagmus, eye strain. |
| | **Noise** | Occupational deafness, nervousness, fatigue. |
| | **Vibration** | Vibration-induced white finger, injuries to joints of hands/arms. |
| | **Radiation** (UV & Ionizing) | Arc eye (welder's flash), cancer, leukemia, aplastic anemia, genetic changes. |
| | **Pressure** | Caisson disease (decompression sickness), air embolism. |
| | **Electricity** | Burns, shock. |
| **2. [[Chemical Hazards]]** | **Dusts** | **[[Pneumoconiosis]]**: Silicosis (silica), Anthracosis (coal), Asbestosis (asbestos), Byssinosis (cotton). |
| | **Gases** | Gas poisoning (CO, HCN, CS2), Asphyxiation. |
| | **Metals** | Toxic hazards from Lead, Mercury, Arsenic, Cadmium, Chromium. |
| | **Solvents** | Benzene, Carbon bisulphide, Trichloroethylene. |
| **3. [[Biological Hazards]]** | **Living Agents** | Brucellosis, Leptospirosis, Anthrax, Tetanus, Hydatidosis, Psittacosis, Fungal infections. |
| **4. Mechanical Hazards** | **Machinery** | Injuries, accidents due to protruding/moving parts, falls. |
| **5. [[Psychosocial Hazards]]** | **Work Environment** | Psychological/behavioral changes (hostility, anxiety, depression, alcoholism), Psychosomatic ill-health (hypertension, peptic ulcer, fatigue). |

**Mnemonic to remember Hazards:** **P**lease **C**heck **B**lood **P**ressure **M**achine

# Medical Measures for Prevention of Occupational Diseases

Prevention of occupational diseases is a major responsibility of the occupational health service. The medical measures include:

### 1. Pre-placement Examination
This is the foundation of an efficient occupational health service. It is done **before** employment.
*   **Purpose:** To place the right man in the right job ([[Ergonomics]]). The worker can perform duties efficiently without detriment to their health.
*   **Components:** Complete medical, family, and occupational history; physical examination; biological/radiological exams (e.g., Chest X-ray, ECG, Vision test).
*   **Benchmark:** It serves as a useful baseline/benchmark for future comparison.
*   **Rejection/Selection:** A worker may be totally rejected or given a job suited to their physical capacities (e.g., a person with potential hernia should not be given a weight-lifting job).

### 2. Periodical Examination
Many occupational diseases are slow to develop (e.g., pneumoconiosis, lead poisoning) and may go unrecognized in early stages.
*   **Objective:** To detect any departure from health at the earliest stage (Secondary Prevention).
*   **Frequency:** Depends on the nature of exposure:
    *   **Daily:** For irritant chemicals like dichromates.
    *   **Monthly:** For Lead, Radium, and Dye-stuffs.
    *   **Annually:** For most other occupations.
*   **Action:** If adverse effects are detected, the worker should be moved away from the exposure.

### 3. Medical and Health Care Services
*   **First Aid:** Essential within the factory to reduce suffering and disability.
*   **Immunization:** Workers should be protected against specific biological hazards (e.g., Tetanus toxoid, Hepatitis B vaccine).
*   **General Treatment:** Prompt and adequate treatment for any occupational injury or disease.

### 4. Notification
*   National laws (e.g., **[[Factories Act, 1948]]**) require the notification of cases and suspected cases of occupational diseases.
*   **Purpose:** To initiate measures for prevention and protection, ensuring effective application of control measures, and investigating working conditions.
*   **Schedule:** The Factories Act lists **29** notifiable diseases (e.g., Silicosis, Anthracosis, Asbestosis).

### 5. Supervision of Working Environment
*   The physician should pay frequent visits to the factory to inspect environmental factors like temperature, lighting, ventilation, humidity, noise, and sanitation.
*   The physician advises the management on matters connecting health and welfare of workers.

### 6. Maintenance and Analysis of Records
*   Worker's health record and occupational disability record must be maintained.
*   Review of data helps to assess the hazards inherent in certain jobs and devise preventive measures.

### 7. Health Education and Counselling
*   Ideally starts before the worker enters the factory.
*   **Content:** Risks involved in the industry, correct use of protective devices (masks, gloves), personal hygiene (hand washing), and lifestyle modifications (nutrition, addiction).
*   **Goal:** To make the worker health-conscious and safety-minded.

**Clinical Relevance:**
**Lead Poisoning (Plumbism):** A classic example where medical surveillance is crucial. Look for **[[Burtonian line]]** (blue line on gums) and basophilic stippling on blood smear during periodic exams.
