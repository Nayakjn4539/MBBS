# [[Identification]] > Bite Marks

### Definition
A **Bite mark** is a pattern injury produced by the dental structures of an animal or human in an object or tissue. It is a vital form of [[trace evidence]] in forensic investigations.

The study of bite marks to identify the assailant falls under the domain of **[[Forensic Odontology]]**.

### Mechanism of Injury
Bite marks are a combination of two forces:
1.  **Compression:** Causing indentation of the tissue (due to teeth closing).
2.  **Traction/Suction:** Causing negative pressure, leading to extravasation of blood (central bruising).

### Characteristics of Human Bite Marks
*   **General Pattern:** Consists of two opposing **U-shaped** arches (maxilla and mandible) separated at their bases.
*   **Appearance:**
    *   **Class Characteristics:** Determine if it is human or animal. Human bites are elliptical/circular/ovoid. Animal bites are usually elongated/V-shaped (snout).
    *   **Individual Characteristics:** Specific features used for identification, such as:
        *   Number of teeth.
        *   Spacing (Diastema).
        *   Rotation or malposition of teeth.
        *   Missing teeth (Edentulous spaces).
        *   Prosthetics/Caps.
        *   Broken or chipped edges.
*   **Injury Types:**
    *   **Abrasion:** Marks from the incisal edges of teeth.
    *   **Contusion (Bruise):** Most common; due to rupture of vessels.
    *   **Laceration:** Tearing of skin (seen in aggressive/sadistic bites).
    *   **Suck Mark:** A central area of **ecchymosis** (hickey) caused by suction, surrounded by the arch of teeth marks.

### Sites of Occurrence
The location of the bite mark often indicates the type of crime or intent:
| Context | Common Sites | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sexual Offences** | Breasts (nipples), Neck, Thighs, Pubic area, Buttocks | Usually "Love bites" or sadistic components of [[sexual assault]]. |
| **Defense Wounds** | Forearms, Hands, Fingers
