# Osteoarthritis (Pathology and Radiology)

[[Osteoarthritis]] (OA), also known as degenerative arthritis or osteoarthrosis, is a chronic disorder of the [[synovial joints]] characterized by progressive softening and disintegration of [[articular cartilage]], accompanied by new growth of cartilage and bone at the joint margins ([[osteophytes]]), and capsular fibrosis. It is essentially a process of "wear and tear" rather than a primary inflammatory condition.

### Pathology and Pathogenesis

The pathological process primarily affects the weight-bearing cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone. The sequence of degenerative changes is as follows:

#### 1. Cartilage Changes
The primary lesion occurs in the [[articular cartilage]].
*   ** biochemical alterations:** The earliest change is an increase in water content and a depletion of [[proteoglycans]] from the cartilage matrix.
*   **Fibrillation:** Repeated weight-bearing on this weakened cartilage leads to flaking and fibrillation (loss of the smooth, shiny surface).
*   **Erosion:** The cartilage gets abraded by the grinding mechanism at points of contact. Eventually, the full thickness of the cartilage is lost, exposing the underlying bone.

#### 2. Bone Changes (Subchondral Bone)
*   **[[Eburnation]]:** Once the cartilage is worn off, the exposed underlying bone rubs against the opposing bone. It becomes hard, polished, and ivory-like (eburnated).
*   **[[Subchondral Sclerosis]]:** The bone below the cartilage thickens and becomes denser due to increased stress transmission.
*   **[[Subchondral Cysts]] (Geodes):** Synovial fluid intrudes into the bone through micro-fractures in the eburnated surface, creating cystic cavities within the bone marrow.
*   **[[Osteophytes]]:** The bone at the non-weight-bearing margins of the joint hypertrophies to form bony spurs or projections called osteophytes. These may break off to form [[loose bodies]] within the joint.

#### 3. Synovial and Capsular Changes
*   **Synovitis:** While primarily non-inflammatory, secondary [[synovitis]] may occur due to irritation from cartilage debris (phagocytosis of debris).
*   **Fibrosis:** In late stages, the capsule and ligaments may become fibrotic and contracted, leading to deformity and stiffness.

> **Clinical Implication:**
> *   **Pain:** Arises from subchondral microfractures, venous congestion, and capsular stretching (cartilage itself is aneural).
> *   **Crepitus:** The grating sound heard/felt on movement is due to the rubbing of eburnated bone surfaces and cartilage irregularity.
> *   **Locking:** May occur if an osteophyte breaks loose and becomes a free-floating body ("joint mouse").

### Radiological Features (X-Ray)

Diagnosis is often confirmed by plain [[radiographs]]. The radiological signs correlate directly with the pathological changes.

#### The Cardinal Signs of OA
To remember the X-ray features, use the mnemonic **LOSS**:

1.  **L** - **Loss of Joint Space:** This is usually the earliest sign. It is non-uniform (asymmetrical). For example, in the knee, the medial compartment is typically affected first, leading to [[genu varum]]. This narrowing represents the loss of articular cartilage thickness.
2.  **O** - **[[Osteophytes]]:** Bony spurs/projections visible at the joint margins.
3.  **S** - **[[Subchondral Sclerosis]]:** Increased whiteness (density) of the bone just beneath the joint surface.
4.  **S** - **[[Subchondral Cysts]]:** Radiolucent (dark) cystic areas seen in the subchondral bone, often surrounded by a sclerotic rim.

**Additional Findings:**
*   **Loose Bodies:** Small calcified or ossified fragments within the joint space.
*   **Deformity:** Such as varus deformity in the knee due to asymmetrical cartilage loss.

### Differential Diagnosis: OA vs. RA

Distinguishing **[[Osteoarthritis]] (OA)** from **[[Rheumatoid Arthritis]] (RA)** on radiographs is a common exam requirement.

| Feature | Osteoarthritis (OA) | Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pathology** | Degenerative (Wear and tear) | Inflammatory (Autoimmune) |
| **Joint Space** | **Asymmetrical** / Non-uniform narrowing (e.g., medial knee) | **Symmetrical** / Uniform narrowing |
| **Bone Density** | **[[Subchondral Sclerosis]]** (increased density) | **[[Juxta-articular Osteopenia]]** (decreased density near joints) |
| **Bone Changes** | **[[Osteophytes]]** (Bone formation) | **Marginal Erosions** (Bone destruction) |
| **Cysts** | [[Subchondral cysts]] present | Subchondral cysts may occur but erosions are more prominent |
| **Affected Joints** | DIP ([[Heberden's nodes]]), PIP ([[Bouchard's nodes]]), 1st CMC, Knee, Hip | MCP, Wrist, PIP (DIP usually spared) |
| **Ankylosis** | Rare (bony ankylosis does not occur) | Common (Fibrous or bony ankylosis) |,,,,

### Specific Joint Manifestations (Radiology)

*   **Knee:**
    *   Most common site.
    *   Medial compartment narrowing is the earliest finding, often leading to varus deformity.
    *   Skyline view of the [[patella]] may show patellofemoral arthritis.
*   **Hip:**
    *   Narrowing is usually in the superior or superolateral aspect of the joint (maximum weight-bearing area).
    *   Shenton’s line may be broken if there is subluxation.
*   **Spine ([[Spondylosis]]):**
    *   Narrowing of intervertebral disc spaces.
    *   Osteophytes (spurs) arising from vertebral bodies.
    *   Sclerosis of vertebral end-plates.
*   **Hand:**
    *   Involvement of Distal Interphalangeal (DIP) joints is characteristic (Heberden's nodes).
    *   Base of the thumb (1st carpometacarpal joint) is frequently affected.
