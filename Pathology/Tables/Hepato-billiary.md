| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Liver Cirrhosis** A condition marked by diffuse remodeling of the liver into parenchymal nodules surrounded by fibrous bands and a variable degree of vascular shunting. It represents an end-point for many chronic liver diseases. | Leading causes worldwide are chronic hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis C, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and alcoholic liver disease. Other causes include primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, metabolic diseases (hemochromatosis, Wilson disease), etc. Some cases are cryptogenic (no clear cause). | Varies by underlying cause (e.g., alcohol consumption, viral infection, obesity, genetic predisposition). | 1. **Chronic Injury:** Persistent injury (e.g., viral, toxic) causes ongoing hepatocyte death. 2. **Stellate Cell Activation:** Chronic inflammation activates hepatic stellate cells, which transform into fibrogenic myofibroblasts. 3. **Fibrosis:** Myofibroblasts deposit collagen and other extracellular matrix components, forming fibrous septa, often in the space of Disse, leading to **sinusoidal capillarization**. 4. **Nodule Formation:** Fibrous septa encircle and trap regenerating hepatocytes, forming regenerative nodules. 5. **Vascular Remodeling:** Disruption of normal architecture and formation of vascular shunts (portosystemic) leads to portal hypertension. Scars can regress if the underlying injury is removed, a state called **incomplete septal cirrhosis**. | - | Liver surface is bumpy, with depressed areas of scarring and bulging regenerative nodules. The liver may be shrunken. Nodule size varies depending on the cause (e.g., micronodular in alcoholic cirrhosis). | Marked by parenchymal nodules surrounded by dense bands of fibrosis. The pattern of scarring (e.g., portal-portal vs portal-central) can vary. Regression features include thin, incomplete scars. **Special stain: Masson trichrome** highlights collagen in blue. | Portal hypertension (leading to ascites, esophageal varices, splenomegaly), hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatocellular carcinoma. | Based on underlying cause (e.g., viral serologies, autoantibodies). Laboratory findings reflect liver failure: elevated bilirubin, AST/ALT; low albumin; prolonged prothrombin time (PT). | Can be classified by etiology (e.g., alcoholic, viral, biliary) or morphology (e.g., micronodular, macronodular). | About 40% are asymptomatic until advanced stages. Symptomatic patients present with anorexia, weight loss, weakness. Advanced disease shows signs of liver failure: jaundice, pruritus, hyperestrogenemia (palmar erythema, spider angiomas, hypogonadism), and complications of portal hypertension. | Treatment of the underlying cause. Management of complications. Liver transplantation is the definitive treatment for end-stage disease. |
| **Alcoholic Cirrhosis (Laennec Cirrhosis)** The final, irreversible stage of alcoholic liver disease, characterized by extensive fibrosis and nodular regeneration. | Chronic, excessive alcohol consumption. | Daily intake of >80g of ethanol, female gender, genetic factors (ALDH variants), comorbid conditions (HCV, iron overload). | Develops in about 10-15% of alcoholics, often after repeated bouts of alcoholic hepatitis. The pathogenesis involves persistent inflammation, stellate cell activation, and pericellular/perisinusoidal fibrosis in acinar zone 3, which progresses to bridging fibrosis and eventually micronodular cirrhosis. Vascular derangements like **phlebosclerosis** are common. | Genetic variation in alcohol-detoxifying enzymes (e.g., **ALDH2 variant** in Asians leads to intolerance). | Initially, liver may be enlarged, but in the final "burned-out" stage, it becomes a small, shrunken organ with a micronodular pattern ('**Laennec cirrhosis**'). Surface is diffusely nodular with a greenish tint from cholestasis. | Characterized by small nodules entrapped in blue-staining fibrous tissue on **Masson trichrome stain**. Fatty accumulation is often absent in the "burned-out" stage. | Hepatic coma, massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage, intercurrent infection, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatocellular carcinoma (1-6% annual risk). | Elevated aminotransferases (AST:ALT ratio > 2:1 is suggestive), hyperbilirubinemia, hypoalbuminemia, prolonged PT. | This is considered a specific type of micronodular cirrhosis. | Similar to other forms of cirrhosis, but may be clinically silent until a stressor (e.g., infection) precipitates hepatic insufficiency. | Total abstinence from alcohol. Nutritional support. Liver transplantation. 5-year survival is 90% for abstainers vs. 50-60% for those who continue drinking. |
| **Alcoholic Liver Disease** A spectrum of liver injury caused by excessive alcohol consumption, comprising three overlapping forms: hepatic steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis. | Excessive alcohol (ethanol) consumption. | **Quantity:** Risk is significant with >80g/day. **Gender:** Women are more susceptible. **Genetics:** Variations in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes. **Comorbidities:** HCV, HBV, hemochromatosis, obesity. | 1. **Steatosis:** Altered redox balance (increased NADH) from alcohol metabolism favors lipogenesis. This is reversible. 2. **Alcoholic Hepatitis (Steatohepatitis):** Hepatocyte injury from acetaldehyde toxicity, oxidative stress (via CYP2E1 induction), and inflammation triggered by gut-derived endotoxins (LPS) acting on Kupffer cells. 3. **Cirrhosis:** Chronic inflammation and injury leads to progressive fibrosis and nodule formation. | **ALDH2 variant:** Low enzyme activity, inability to oxidize acetaldehyde, leads to alcohol intolerance. **CYP2E1 induction:** High alcohol levels induce this enzyme, which produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) during alcohol metabolism. | **Steatosis:** Enlarged (4-6 kg), soft, yellow, greasy liver. **Hepatitis/Cirrhosis:** Liver can be enlarged, shrunken, or normal, with a nodular surface in cirrhosis. | **Steatosis:** Macrovesicular steatosis, initially in centrilobular (zone 3) hepatocytes.  **Hepatitis:** Features include **ballooned hepatocytes**, **Mallory hyaline** (tangled keratin filaments), and neutrophilic infiltrates. **Perivenular/pericellular fibrosis** ("chicken wire" pattern) is characteristic. | Portal hypertension, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma. Increased susceptibility to infections. | **Steatosis:** Mild elevation of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.  **Hepatitis:** Hyperbilirubinemia, elevated aminotransferases (**AST > ALT, ratio > 2:1**), neutrophilic leukocytosis. | 1. **Hepatic steatosis** (fatty liver) 2. **Alcoholic hepatitis** (steatohepatitis) 3. **Alcoholic cirrhosis** (steatofibrosis) | **Steatosis:** Often asymptomatic, may cause hepatomegaly. **Hepatitis:** Acute onset after heavy drinking; malaise, anorexia, weight loss, upper abdominal discomfort, tender hepatomegaly, fever. | Abstinence from alcohol, adequate nutrition. Liver transplantation for end-stage disease. |
| **Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)** A primary malignant tumor of hepatocytes. It is one of the most common cancers worldwide. | Most cases (85-90%) arise in the setting of cirrhosis. Major etiologies include chronic viral hepatitis (HBV, HCV), alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and metabolic diseases like hemochromatosis. Aflatoxin exposure is a synergistic factor, especially with HBV. | Chronic liver disease/cirrhosis (any cause), male gender, hepatitis B or C infection, aflatoxin exposure, metabolic syndrome, hereditary hemochromatosis, α1-antitrypsin deficiency. | The pathogenesis involves a cycle of chronic injury, inflammation, and hepatocyte regeneration which facilitates the acquisition of driver mutations. This leads to precursor lesions (**dysplastic nodules** in cirrhotic liver; some **hepatocellular adenomas** in non-cirrhotic liver), which then progress to overt HCC. HBV can directly contribute through integration of its DNA and the effects of the **HBx protein**. | **Activating mutations:** β-catenin (**CTNNB1**, 40%), TERT promoter (upregulates telomerase, 50-60%). **Inactivating mutations:** **TP53** (up to 60%). **Fibrolamellar HCC variant:** Associated with a fusion gene leading to aberrant protein kinase A activity. | Can appear as a unifocal large mass, multiple discrete nodules, or a diffusely infiltrative cancer. Often pale/yellow due to fat or green due to cholestasis. Prone to vascular invasion, especially into the portal vein. | Tumor cells resemble hepatocytes but grow in abnormal patterns: thickened plates (trabeculae), pseudoacinar structures, or solid sheets. Poorly differentiated tumors show marked atypia. Precursor lesions include **large cell change** and **small cell change**. The **fibrolamellar variant** shows large polygonal cells with granular cytoplasm and dense collagen bundles. | Intrahepatic and distant metastases (especially to the lungs). Cachexia, gastrointestinal bleeding, tumor rupture with hemorrhage. | Elevated serum **α-fetoprotein (AFP)** is a frequent finding in advanced disease but is not sensitive for early screening. Imaging (CT/MRI) with contrast shows characteristic arterial hyperenhancement followed by venous "washout". | Can be graded as well, moderately, or poorly differentiated. **Fibrolamellar carcinoma** is a distinctive histologic subtype with a better prognosis. | Often nonspecific: abdominal pain, malaise, fatigue, weight loss, hepatomegaly. May have features of underlying chronic liver disease. Can be discovered on screening in high-risk patients. | Surgical resection for tumors in non-cirrhotic livers. For cirrhosis-associated HCC, options include liver transplantation, image-guided tumor ablation (e.g., radiofrequency ablation), or chemotherapy. Prognosis is generally poor. |
| **Tumors of Liver** Hepatic mass lesions can be non-neoplastic, benign neoplastic, or malignant primary or metastatic tumors. | **Metastatic:** Most common source is colon, breast, lung, pancreas.  **Primary Malignant:** HCC, cholangiocarcinoma. **Benign:** Hepatocellular adenoma, cavernous hemangioma.  **Non-neoplastic:** Focal nodular hyperplasia, abscesses. | Varies by tumor type. Oral contraceptives for hepatocellular adenoma; cirrhosis for HCC; liver fluke infestation for cholangiocarcinoma. | Varies by tumor. Most malignant tumors arise from accumulated genetic mutations. Some benign lesions like focal nodular hyperplasia are thought to be hyperplastic responses to altered blood flow. | Varies widely. See specific tumor entries (HCC, cholangiocarcinoma, adenoma). | Metastases are typically multiple nodules. HCC can be unifocal, multifocal, or diffuse. Hemangiomas are red-blue soft nodules. Focal nodular hyperplasia often has a central stellate scar. | Varies widely by tumor type. Histology is key to diagnosis. See specific entries. | Jaundice, hepatic failure, rupture and hemorrhage (adenoma, HCC), metastasis. | Imaging (ultrasound, CT, MRI) is primary diagnostic tool. Biopsy provides definitive diagnosis. Tumor markers (e.g., AFP for HCC) can be useful. | **Non-Neoplastic:** Focal nodular hyperplasia, regenerative nodules.  **Benign Neoplasms:** Cavernous hemangioma, hepatocellular adenoma.  **Primary Malignant:** Hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, angiosarcoma, hepatoblastoma.  **Metastatic Tumors.** | Often asymptomatic and found incidentally. May present with hepatomegaly, abdominal pain, or features of liver dysfunction if extensive. | Depends on type and stage. Resection, transplantation, chemotherapy, or observation. |
| **Viral Hepatitis** Liver inflammation caused by a group of hepatotropic viruses, including Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. | **HAV, HEV:** Fecal-oral transmission (contaminated food/water). **HBV, HCV, HDV:** Parenteral transmission (blood, sexual contact, perinatal). | **HAV/HEV:** Poor hygiene, travel to endemic areas.  **HBV/HCV/HDV:** IV drug use, unprotected sex, needle-stick injuries, blood transfusions (historical), perinatal exposure. | Hepatocellular injury is primarily immune-mediated. Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and NK cells recognize and kill virus-infected hepatocytes. The viruses themselves (except perhaps high-level HBV) are not directly cytopathic. The outcome depends on the virus and the host immune response, ranging from acute self-limited infection to chronic infection, cirrhosis, and HCC. | Viruses have their own genomes: **HAV:** ssRNA picornavirus. **HBV:** Partially dsDNA hepadnavirus. Uses reverse transcription.  **HCV:** ssRNA flavivirus. Its RNA polymerase lacks proofreading, leading to many **quasispecies**.  **HDV:** Defective circular ssRNA virus; requires HBV for replication.  **HEV:** ssRNA hepevirus. | **Acute:** Liver may be normal, enlarged, or shrunken (in fulminant failure). **Chronic:** May be unremarkable or show features of cirrhosis (bumpy, fibrotic surface). | **Acute:** Lobular inflammation (lymphocytes), hepatocyte ballooning, apoptosis (**acidophil bodies/Councilman bodies**), and necrosis.  **Chronic:** Portal inflammation (lymphocytes, plasma cells), **interface activity** (piecemeal necrosis), bridging fibrosis, and eventual cirrhosis. Specific features: **ground-glass hepatocytes** (HBV), lymphoid aggregates and steatosis (HCV). | **Acute liver failure** (rare, mainly with HAV, HBV). **Chronic hepatitis** (HBV, HCV). **Cirrhosis** and **hepatocellular carcinoma** (HBV, HCV). Extrahepatic manifestations (e.g., cryoglobulinemia with HCV). | Based on detection of viral antigens (e.g., **HBsAg**) and antibodies (e.g., anti-HCV, IgM anti-HAV). Viral load testing (PCR for HBV DNA, HCV RNA) is used to monitor activity. Markedly elevated serum transaminases (ALT, AST) in acute phase. | Hepatitis A, B, C, D, E. Each has distinct virology, epidemiology, and clinical course. | **Acute:** Fatigue, nausea, anorexia, jaundice, right upper quadrant pain. Many infections are asymptomatic (especially HAV in children, HCV). **Chronic:** Often asymptomatic or with nonspecific fatigue. Disease is often discovered via abnormal liver tests or screening. | **HAV/HEV:** Supportive care.  **HBV:** Interferon and antiviral agents (e.g., entecavir) can suppress the virus but cure is difficult. Vaccination prevents infection.  **HCV:** Highly effective direct-acting antiviral agents offer a cure for >95% of patients. |
| **Chronic Hepatitis** Symptomatic, biochemical, or serologic evidence of continuing or relapsing hepatic disease for more than 6 months. | Most commonly caused by Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Hepatitis B virus (HBV). Other causes include autoimmune hepatitis, drug/toxin-induced hepatitis, and Wilson disease. | Risk factors are for the underlying etiology (e.g., risk factors for viral transmission). For HCV, older age, male gender, alcohol use, and immunosuppression are associated with faster progression. | Persistent inflammation in the portal tracts (lymphocytic/lymphoplasmacytic) spills into the adjacent parenchyma, causing ongoing hepatocyte injury (**interface activity**). This chronic injury drives fibrosis, which starts in the portal tracts and progresses to bridging fibrosis and eventually cirrhosis. | - | The liver may appear normal or progress to show the features of cirrhosis (bumpy surface, firm consistency). | The defining histologic feature is portal lymphocytic or lymphoplasmacytic inflammation, often crossing the limiting plate (**interface activity**). Fibrosis is present and is graded by stage. Specific etiologic clues may be present: **ground-glass hepatocytes** in HBV; lymphoid aggregates and steatosis in HCV; plasma cells in autoimmune hepatitis. | Progression to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. Increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Immune complex diseases (vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, cryoglobulinemia). | Persistent elevation of serum transaminases (AST, ALT) is the key biochemical finding. Serologic markers identify the cause (e.g., HBsAg for chronic HBV, anti-HCV and HCV RNA for chronic HCV). | Classified by etiology (viral, autoimmune, etc.) and by grade (degree of inflammation) and stage (degree of fibrosis) on liver biopsy. | Often asymptomatic. Fatigue is the most common symptom. Less common are malaise, loss of appetite, and bouts of mild jaundice. Symptoms of cirrhosis may develop late. | Treatment is directed at the underlying cause (e.g., antivirals for HBV/HCV, immunosuppression for autoimmune hepatitis) to halt disease progression. Liver transplantation for decompensated cirrhosis. |
| **Haemochromatosis** A disorder caused by excessive iron absorption, leading to iron deposition (hemosiderosis) and damage in the liver, pancreas, heart, joints, and endocrine organs. | **Hereditary:** Autosomal recessive disorder, usually due to mutations in the HFE gene.  **Secondary (Hemosiderosis):** Due to parenteral iron overload (e.g., multiple transfusions) or conditions with ineffective erythropoiesis (e.g., thalassemia). | For hereditary form: Caucasian populations of European origin (for HFE mutations). Family history. | The primary defect is inappropriately low levels of the hormone **hepcidin**, the main regulator of iron absorption. Low hepcidin leads to increased iron uptake from the gut. HFE protein is involved in regulating hepcidin synthesis. Excess iron is toxic, causing damage through: 1) generation of free radicals (lipid peroxidation), 2) stimulation of collagen formation by stellate cells, and 3) direct DNA damage. Disease manifests after ~20g of stored iron has accumulated. | **Hereditary form is usually caused by mutations in the HFE gene.** • **C282Y:** Cysteine-to-tyrosine substitution. Most common.  • **H63D:** Histidine-to-aspartate substitution.  Rarer mutations are in **HJV, HAMP, TFR2**, causing juvenile hemochromatosis. | In early stages, the liver is slightly larger, dense, and chocolate brown. It progresses to a small, shrunken liver with a micronodular pattern of cirrhosis, often dark brown to nearly black. Other organs like the pancreas and heart also become pigmented. | Deposition of golden-yellow **hemosiderin granules**, first in periportal hepatocytes, then throughout the lobule, in Kupffer cells, and bile duct epithelium. Stains with **Prussian blue**. Iron is directly toxic, so inflammation is characteristically absent. Progresses to cirrhosis and pancreatic fibrosis. | Micronodular cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus ("bronze diabetes"), cardiomyopathy (arrhythmias), atypical arthritis (pseudogout), hypogonadism. Very high risk (200-fold greater) of **hepatocellular carcinoma**. | High serum iron, high ferritin, high transferrin saturation. Diagnosis confirmed by genetic testing for HFE mutations. | **I. Hereditary Hemochromatosis** (due to HFE, HJV, etc. mutations) **II. Secondary Hemochromatosis (Hemosiderosis)** (due to transfusions, hemolytic anemias) | Symptoms appear late (4th-5th decade in men), and include hepatomegaly, abdominal pain, abnormal skin pigmentation (slate-gray), diabetes mellitus, cardiac dysfunction, and arthritis. Many are now diagnosed in a precirrhotic stage due to screening. | Regular phlebotomy to deplete iron stores. With treatment, life expectancy is normal if started before irreversible damage occurs. |
| **Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)** Presence of hepatic steatosis in individuals who do not consume significant alcohol. A subset of patients develops inflammation and fibrosis, termed **nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)**. | Strongly associated with metabolic syndrome, which includes obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia. | Obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance. High-fructose diets and obstructive sleep apnea are also associated factors. | **Two-Hit Hypothesis (Simplified view):** 1. **Insulin resistance** leads to increased flux of free fatty acids to the liver and increased hepatic lipogenesis, causing **steatosis** (first hit). 2. Fat-laden hepatocytes are vulnerable to a **second hit**, such as oxidative stress (from lipid peroxidation) and inflammatory cytokines (like TNF-α from dysfunctional adipose tissue), which causes hepatocyte injury, inflammation (NASH), and fibrosis. The process is now understood to be more complex, involving lipotoxicity and altered lipophagy. | Complex associations with genetic variants, but no single gene is causative. | Liver is enlarged and yellow, similar to alcoholic fatty liver. In advanced NASH, features of cirrhosis develop. | Histology is very similar to alcoholic liver disease. **NASH diagnosis requires steatosis, lobular inflammation, and ballooned hepatocytes**. Mallory hyaline may be present. Fibrosis typically begins in a perisinusoidal/pericellular "spider web" or "chicken wire" pattern around the central vein. Stains: **Masson trichrome** for fibrosis. | Progression to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. Increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (can occur even without cirrhosis). High risk of death from cardiovascular disease due to the association with metabolic syndrome. | Elevated serum AST and ALT are seen in most NASH patients, but may be normal. Liver biopsy is required for the diagnosis of NASH and to stage fibrosis. | 1. **NAFLD** or Isolated fatty liver (steatosis only) 2. **Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)** (steatosis with inflammation and hepatocyte injury) | Usually asymptomatic. Often discovered incidentally due to elevated liver enzymes or findings on imaging done for other reasons. Some may have fatigue or right-sided abdominal discomfort from hepatomegaly. | Treatment is aimed at correcting underlying risk factors: weight loss, diet, exercise, and management of diabetes and hyperlipidemia. |
| **Wilson Disease** An autosomal recessive disorder caused by accumulation of toxic levels of copper in the liver, brain, and eye. | Inherited loss-of-function mutations in the ATP7B gene. | Family history of the disease. | 1. The **ATP7B gene** encodes a copper-transporting ATPase required for (a) excreting copper into bile and (b) incorporating copper into apoceruloplasmin to form ceruloplasmin. 2. Mutation leads to failure of copper excretion, causing copper to accumulate in hepatocytes. 3. Excess copper causes toxic injury via the **Fenton reaction** (generating free radicals), binding to sulfhydryl groups on proteins, and displacing other metals from metalloenzymes. 4. Hepatocyte injury causes copper to spill into the circulation, leading to deposition and damage in other tissues, particularly the brain (basal ganglia) and eye (cornea). | Loss-of-function mutations in the **ATP7B gene**. Over 300 variants are known. Most patients are compound heterozygotes. | Liver shows variable changes, ranging from steatosis to massive necrosis (in acute failure) to established cirrhosis. | Hepatic changes are variable and can mimic fatty liver disease, acute hepatitis, or chronic hepatitis. Features can include steatosis, focal necrosis, ballooned hepatocytes, prominent **Mallory hyaline**. Eventually progresses to cirrhosis. Histochemical copper staining is not sensitive or specific for diagnosis. | Acute or chronic liver failure, cirrhosis. Neuropsychiatric disorders (movement disorders like tremor/chorea, dystonia, psychiatric symptoms). Hemolytic anemia. | Decreased serum ceruloplasmin, increased hepatic copper content (on biopsy, the most accurate test), and increased urinary copper excretion. Demonstration of **Kayser-Fleischer rings** on slit-lamp examination is diagnostic. | - | Extremely variable presentation, with age of onset from 6 to 40 years. Can present as acute or chronic liver disease, or with neurologic/psychiatric symptoms. Eye findings are **Kayser-Fleischer rings** (green to brown copper deposits in Descemet membrane of the cornea). | Long-term copper chelation therapy (e.g., D-penicillamine) or zinc-based therapy (blocks copper uptake). Liver transplantation is curative for patients with advanced liver disease. |
| **Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (α1AT) Deficiency** An autosomal recessive disorder of protein folding, causing very low levels of circulating α1AT. It leads to lung disease (emphysema) and liver disease. | Inherited mutations in the α1AT gene (SERPINA1). | Family history. Northern European descent (for PiZZ allele). | Liver disease is due to a **toxic gain-of-function** mutation.  1. Certain mutations (e.g., PiZ) cause the α1AT protein to misfold after synthesis in hepatocytes.  2. The misfolded protein (α1AT-Z) cannot be secreted and accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 3. This accumulation causes **ER stress** and triggers the **unfolded protein response**, which can lead to hepatocyte apoptosis and injury. Only a subset of individuals with the deficient genotype develops overt liver disease, suggesting other genetic/environmental factors play a role. | Mutations in the protease inhibitor (**Pi**) locus. The most common clinically significant mutation is **PiZ**. Genotype **PiZZ** results in α1AT levels that are only 10% of normal. | Liver can range from normal to cirrhotic. | Characterized by the presence of round-to-oval, cytoplasmic globular inclusions in hepatocytes. These inclusions are **Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive and diastase-resistant**, appearing as magenta granules. They appear first in periportal hepatocytes. Electron microscopy shows ER dilated by aggregates of misfolded protein. | Neonatal hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis in adulthood. Increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (2-3% of PiZZ adults). The major non-hepatic complication is pulmonary emphysema. | Low serum levels of α1-antitrypsin. Diagnosis is confirmed by phenotype/genotype testing. Liver biopsy showing characteristic inclusions is supportive. | Alleles are denoted by letters (e.g., M, S, Z). Common genotypes are PiMM (normal), PiMZ (heterozygote carrier), PiZZ (homozygous deficient). | Can present in neonates with cholestasis, or in children/adults with chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or HCC. The most commonly diagnosed inherited hepatic disorder in infants and children. | No specific treatment for the liver disease. Management of complications. Liver transplantation is curative for the hepatic disease (but not the lung disease). |
| **Benign Neoplasms of Liver** Non-cancerous tumors of the liver, including Cavernous Hemangioma and Hepatocellular Adenoma. | **Hemangioma:** Unknown.  **Adenoma:** Strongly associated with oral contraceptive and anabolic steroid use. Obesity and metabolic syndrome are also risk factors. | **Adenoma:** Young women, oral contraceptive use, anabolic steroid use. | **Adenoma:** Hormonal stimulation is a key factor. Three molecular subtypes are defined by specific mutations which drive proliferation of hepatocytes. | **Hepatocellular Adenoma:** 1. **HNF1α-inactivated:** Loss-of-function mutation in HNF1A gene. Minimal risk of malignant transformation. 2. **Inflammatory:** Activating mutations in **gp130**, leading to JAK-STAT activation. 3. **β-catenin-activated:** Activating mutations in **CTNNB1**. High risk of transformation to HCC. | **Hemangioma:** Discrete, red-blue, soft subcapsular nodule, usually <2 cm. **Adenoma:** Discrete mass, sometimes with hemorrhage. | **Hemangioma:** Dilated, thin-walled vascular channels in a fibrous stroma.  **Adenoma:** Composed of hepatocytes in thin plates. Lacks normal portal tracts and interlobular bile ducts. Subtypes have distinct features (e.g., fat in HNF1α-mutated, sinusoidal dilation in inflammatory). | **Adenoma:** Risk of rupture with massive abdominal bleeding (a surgical emergency). Risk of malignant transformation to HCC, especially in β-catenin activated type. | Usually found on imaging (ultrasound, CT, MRI). Biopsy can confirm but may risk hemorrhage in adenomas. Immunohistochemistry can classify adenoma subtypes (e.g., absent LFABP in HNF1α type, nuclear β-catenin). | **Most Common Types:** 1. Cavernous Hemangioma (most common overall benign liver tumor) 2. Hepatocellular Adenoma (with molecular subtypes) | Usually asymptomatic and found incidentally. Adenomas may cause abdominal pain or present as an emergency due to rupture and hemorrhage. | **Hemangioma:** No treatment needed. **Adenoma:** For small tumors, cessation of oral contraceptives and observation. For large (>5 cm) or β-catenin-activated tumors, resection is recommended due to risk of hemorrhage and malignancy. |
| **Bridging Necrosis of Liver** A pattern of widespread hepatocyte death where a zone of necrosis connects (bridges) adjacent vascular structures, such as central veins to portal tracts, or adjacent portal tracts. | Seen in severe forms of acute liver injury, such as severe viral hepatitis (A, B, D), autoimmune hepatitis, or toxic/ischemic injuries. | - | Represents a severe degree of parenchymal injury. Widespread hepatocyte loss leads to collapse of the reticulin framework. If the patient survives, this collapse and subsequent repair can lead to the rapid formation of fibrous septa, a key step in the development of post-necrotic cirrhosis. | - | - | On microscopy, an area of confluent necrosis is seen extending from a central vein to a portal tract or between portal tracts. The space is filled with cellular debris and macrophages. The underlying reticulin meshwork collapses. **Pan-acinar necrosis** is when the entire lobule is obliterated. | A histologic hallmark of severe acute hepatitis. If extensive, it leads to acute liver failure. It can predispose to the development of cirrhosis. | - | - | This is a histologic finding, not a clinical syndrome. The clinical picture is that of the underlying severe acute hepatitis (jaundice, coagulopathy, encephalopathy). | Treatment is supportive and directed at the underlying cause of the severe liver injury. |
| **Ground Glass Hepatocytes** A specific microscopic finding where hepatocytes have a swollen, finely granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm resembling ground glass. | Caused by accumulation of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of hepatocytes. | Seen in patients with chronic Hepatitis B infection. | During chronic HBV infection, large quantities of non-infective viral envelope proteins (HBsAg) are produced. These proteins accumulate and distend the ER, creating the characteristic appearance. | - | - | On H&E stain, hepatocytes show a light pink, finely granular, "ground-glass" cytoplasmic appearance. **Immunostaining for HBsAg** confirms the diagnosis, showing brown staining of the cytoplasm. | The presence of ground-glass hepatocytes is a marker of chronic HBV infection, which carries risks of cirrhosis and HCC. | - | - | This is a histologic finding, not a clinical syndrome. | - |
| **Hepatic Failure** The most severe form of liver disease, where 80-90% of hepatic functional capacity is lost. It can be acute or chronic. | **Acute:** Most often caused by drugs/toxins (acetaminophen is #1), viral hepatitis (A, B, E), or autoimmune hepatitis. **Chronic:** The end-result of progressive chronic liver diseases like viral hepatitis (B, C), alcoholic liver disease, and NAFLD. | Depends on underlying etiology. | Occurs when the liver can no longer maintain homeostasis. This leads to a constellation of systemic problems:  • **Encephalopathy:** Failure to detoxify ammonia.  • **Coagulopathy:** Failure to synthesize clotting factors.  • **Jaundice:** Failure to conjugate and excrete bilirubin.  • **Portal Hypertension:** Disrupted blood flow.  • **Hepatorenal Syndrome:** Systemic vasodilation and renal vasoconstriction leading to renal failure. | - | **Acute:** Massive hepatic necrosis leads to a small, shrunken, soft liver. **Chronic:** Typically shows end-stage cirrhosis. | **Acute:** Widespread hepatocyte necrosis with parenchymal collapse. **Chronic:** Features of end-stage cirrhosis with extensive fibrosis and regenerative nodules. | Hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy with bleeding, portal hypertension, ascites, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatopulmonary syndrome, portopulmonary hypertension, multiorgan failure, death. | Markedly elevated bilirubin, prolonged PT/PTT, elevated ammonia, low albumin (in chronic). | 1. **Acute Liver Failure:** Occurs within 26 weeks of injury in a person with no prior liver disease. 2. **Chronic Liver Failure:** Occurs after years of progressive injury. 3. **Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure:** An acute insult superimposed on pre-existing advanced chronic disease. | Jaundice, nausea, vomiting. Followed by life-threatening **hepatic encephalopathy** (confusion, coma, **asterixis**) and **coagulopathy** (easy bruising, bleeding). | Supportive care for complications. Liver transplantation offers the best hope for survival. Mortality without transplant is about 80%. |
| **Hereditary Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia** A group of genetic disorders characterized by elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin due to impaired bilirubin conjugation. | Caused by genetic deficiency of the enzyme UGT1A1 (uridine diphosphate-glucuronyltransferase), which is responsible for bilirubin conjugation. | Family history. | The enzyme UGT1A1 conjugates bilirubin with glucuronic acid, making it water-soluble for excretion into bile. Deficiency of this enzyme leads to accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood. The severity of the disease depends on the degree of enzyme deficiency. | Mutations in the **UGT1A1** gene. | Liver is morphologically normal. | Liver histology is normal. | **Kernicterus** (bilirubin encephalopathy) in severe forms (Crigler-Najjar type 1) due to deposition of unconjugated bilirubin in the brain of infants. | Elevated serum bilirubin, predominantly unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin. Normal liver enzymes. | 1. **Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1:** Complete absence of UGT1A1 activity. Severe.  2. **Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 2:** Markedly reduced UGT1A1 activity. Less severe. 3. **Gilbert syndrome:** Mildly reduced UGT1A1 activity. Common and benign. | **Type 1:** Severe jaundice and neurologic damage (kernicterus) in neonates; fatal.  **Type 2:** Less severe jaundice.  **Gilbert:** Mild, fluctuating jaundice, often noticed during times of stress, illness, or fasting. Clinically innocuous. | **Type 1:** Phototherapy, liver transplantation.  **Type 2 / Gilbert:** Usually no treatment needed. |
| **Kernicterus** Neurologic damage (bilirubin encephalopathy) in infants caused by the deposition of unconjugated bilirubin in the brain. | Occurs in conditions with severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, such as Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1, or severe neonatal jaundice. | Prematurity, conditions causing severe hemolysis, genetic defects in bilirubin metabolism. | Unconjugated bilirubin is lipid-soluble and can cross the immature blood-brain barrier in infants. At excessive levels, the unbound fraction diffuses into tissues, particularly the brain, where it is neurotoxic. | - | - | - | Permanent neurologic deficits, developmental delays, hearing loss, or death. | - | - | Lethargy, poor feeding, hypotonia, progressing to hypertonia and seizures in affected infants. | Prevention is key. Treatment of severe hyperbilirubinemia with intensive phototherapy and exchange transfusion. |
| **Neonatal Cholestasis** Prolonged conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in an infant beyond 14-21 days of life. | Diverse causes, broadly divided into obstructive and nonobstructive. **Obstructive: Extrahepatic biliary atresia** is the most important. **Nonobstructive:** Infections, metabolic diseases (galactosemia), genetic disorders (Alagille syndrome), α1AT deficiency. | Varies with etiology. | Pathogenesis depends on the cause. **Biliary Atresia:** Complete or partial obstruction of the extrahepatic biliary tree, leading to cholestasis and fibrosis. The cause is unknown (viral, toxic, autoimmune theories). **Alagille Syndrome:** Paucity of bile ducts due to a developmental defect. | **Alagille syndrome:** Loss-of-function mutations in **JAG1** or **NOTCH2** (Notch signaling pathway). **Other causes:** See α1AT deficiency, Wilson Disease, etc. | - | Common features are hepatocanalicular cholestasis and **giant-cell or syncytial cell change** with multinucleated hepatocytes. Features of biliary obstruction (portal edema, ductular reaction) are seen in biliary atresia. Paucity of bile ducts is seen in Alagille syndrome. | Progressive liver damage, cirrhosis, liver failure if untreated. | Elevated conjugated bilirubin. Imaging (ultrasound, HIDA scan) and liver biopsy are key to differentiate obstructive (surgical) from nonobstructive (medical) causes. | **Obstructive Biliary Disease:**  • Extrahepatic biliary atresia **Nonobstructive Cholestasis:**  • Infections  • Genetic/Metabolic disorders  • Alagille syndrome | Persistent jaundice, dark urine, light or acholic stools, hepatomegaly. | **Biliary Atresia:** Surgical intervention (Kasai portoenterostomy). Liver transplantation is often required. **Other causes:** Treatment of the specific underlying disorder. |
| **Preeclampsia and Eclampsia** A pregnancy-specific syndrome of hypertension, proteinuria, and edema. When convulsions occur, it is called eclampsia. Liver involvement is a key feature. | Cause is unknown, but related to abnormal placental development and maternal endothelial dysfunction. | Pregnancy. | The hepatic pathology is thought to result from widespread endothelial dysfunction and vasospasm, leading to hepatic ischemia and thrombosis. This causes periportal fibrin deposition and hemorrhage. | - | Blood under pressure can coalesce to form a **hepatic hematoma**. Dissection of blood under the Glisson capsule can lead to catastrophic hepatic rupture. | The characteristic lesions are **periportal sinusoids containing fibrin deposits** associated with hemorrhage into the space of Disse. This leads to periportal hepatocellular coagulative necrosis. | HELLP syndrome (**H**emolysis, **E**levated **L**iver enzymes, **L**ow **P**latelets). Coagulopathy, hepatic hematoma, liver rupture, eclamptic seizures, maternal and fetal death. | Modest to severe elevation of serum aminotransferases, mild elevation of bilirubin. Thrombocytopenia. | - | Right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, along with the cardinal signs of hypertension and proteinuria. Can progress to seizures (eclampsia). | Termination of pregnancy is the definitive treatment. Mild cases may be managed conservatively, but severe cases require delivery to prevent lethal complications. |
| **Portal Hypertension** Increased resistance to portal blood flow. | Divided by location of obstruction: **Prehepatic:** Obstructive thrombosis of the portal vein. **Intrahepatic:** Cirrhosis is the dominant cause. Schistosomiasis, massive fatty change. **Posthepatic:** Severe right-sided heart failure, constrictive pericarditis, hepatic vein outflow obstruction (Budd-Chiari syndrome). | Risk factors for underlying cause (cirrhosis, thrombosis, etc.). | Pathophysiology is complex, involving two main factors: 1. **Increased resistance to portal flow:** In cirrhosis, this is caused by architectural disruption (fibrosis, nodules) and contraction of stellate cells. 2. **Increased portal venous inflow:** Caused by splanchnic arterial vasodilation (mediated by nitric oxide), leading to a hyperdynamic circulation. | - | Manifests as congestive splenomegaly (enlarged spleen). | - | The four major consequences are: 1. **Ascites** (fluid in peritoneal cavity) 2. **Formation of portosystemic venous shunts** (esophageal varices, hemorrhoids, caput medusae) 3. **Congestive splenomegaly** (can lead to hypersplenism) 4. **Hepatic encephalopathy** | Clinical diagnosis based on presence of complications. Can be measured directly but is usually inferred. | Classified based on site of obstruction: Prehepatic, Intrahepatic, Posthepatic. | Clinical features are those of its complications: abdominal distention from ascites, massive hematemesis from bleeding esophageal varices, neurologic changes from encephalopathy. | Management of complications (e.g., diuretics for ascites, beta-blockers and endoscopy for varices). Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. Treatment of underlying liver disease. |
| **Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC)** An autoimmune disease characterized by inflammatory destruction of small- and medium-sized intrahepatic bile ducts. Formerly known as Primary Biliary Cirrhosis. | Autoimmune. The trigger is unknown but may involve exposure to environmental factors (infections, chemicals) in genetically susceptible individuals. | Striking female predominance (9:1), peak incidence 40-50 years. Family members have increased risk. Associated with other autoimmune diseases like Sjögren syndrome (70%), thyroid disease, scleroderma. | Believed to be a T-lymphocyte-mediated attack on the epithelial cells of small interlobular bile ducts. This destruction of bile ducts leads to cholestasis. Retained toxic bile salts then cause secondary hepatocellular injury (**cholate stasis**), which eventually leads to fibrosis and cirrhosis. | - | In end-stage disease, the liver is cirrhotic. Cirrhotic nodules tend to be elongated ('garland-shaped'). | The hallmark is the **florid duct lesion**: lymphocytic and/or granulomatous destruction of an interlobular bile duct. Disease progression leads to loss of small bile ducts (**ductopenia**). Features of cholestasis are seen in periportal hepatocytes (**feathery degeneration**, Mallory hyaline). | Cirrhosis, portal hypertension. Hypercholesterolemia. Vitamin D malabsorption leading to osteomalacia/osteoporosis. Increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. | Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase. The most characteristic finding is the presence of **antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA)** in 90-95% of patients, directed against the E2 component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Elevated serum IgM. | - | Often detected in asymptomatic patients due to elevated alkaline phosphatase. Symptomatic patients present with fatigue and pruritus (itching). Jaundice is a late finding. Other features include skin hyperpigmentation and xanthelasmas. | Oral ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) slows disease progression. Obeticholic acid for non-responders. Liver transplantation for end-stage disease yields excellent results. |
| **Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC)** An autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and obliterative fibrosis of both intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts, leading to strictures. | Autoimmune. Trigger is unknown, but likely involves environmental and genetic factors. A proposed mechanism involves T cells activated in the gut migrating to the liver and cross-reacting with bile duct antigens. | Male predominance (2:1), occurs in 3rd-5th decades. Strongly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis in 70% of patients). First-degree relatives have an increased risk. | An immunologically mediated process leads to chronic inflammation and edema of the bile ducts. This causes progressive fibrosis and stricture formation, leading to obliteration of the duct lumen. The resulting obstruction and cholestasis leads to secondary biliary cirrhosis. | Association with HLA-B8. | - | Large ducts show periductal inflammation and circumferential **"onion skin" fibrosis**, which eventually leads to obliteration by a "tombstone" scar. Smaller ducts are not directly involved but show signs of cholestasis. Eventually leads to biliary cirrhosis. | Biliary cirrhosis, chronic pancreatitis, chronic cholecystitis. High lifetime risk (20%) of developing **cholangiocarcinoma**. | Persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase. Atypical perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (**pANCA**) are found in ~65%. AMA is typically negative. The gold standard for diagnosis is imaging (ERCP/MRCP) showing characteristic **"beading"** (irregular strictures and dilations) of the biliary tree. | A variant, **small-duct PSC**, involves only smaller bile ducts and has a normal ERCP/MRCP. | Fatigue, pruritus, jaundice. Ascending cholangitis can be the initial presentation. Nearly half are asymptomatic at presentation and are found due to screening in ulcerative colitis patients. | No established medical therapy. Cholestyramine for pruritus. Endoscopic dilation or stenting for dominant strictures. Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for end-stage liver disease. |
| **Cholangiocarcinoma** An adenocarcinoma arising from the epithelial cells of the biliary tree (cholangiocytes). Can be intrahepatic or extrahepatic. | Caused by conditions that lead to chronic inflammation and cholestasis. | Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), infestation by liver flukes (Opisthorchis, Clonorchis), hepatolithiasis, fibropolycystic liver disease, chronic viral hepatitis (B and C), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. | Chronic injury, inflammation, and regeneration of the biliary epithelium in the setting of risk factors leads to the acquisition of driver mutations, which promote malignant transformation. Precursor lesions are termed biliary intraepithelial neoplasia. | **KRAS** mutations are common in both types.  **Intrahepatic tumors** have distinctive mutations in **IDH1/IDH2** and fusion genes involving **FGFR2**.  **Extrahepatic tumors** are more likely to have mutations in **TP53** and **SMAD4**. | **Intrahepatic:** Usually a firm, gray-white mass in a non-cirrhotic liver.  **Extrahepatic:** Can be a firm nodule in the bile duct wall, diffusely infiltrative, or papillary. **Klatskin tumors** are perihilar tumors at the junction of the right and left hepatic ducts. | Features of adenocarcinoma: clearly defined glandular/tubular structures lined by malignant cells, embedded in an abundant, desmoplastic (fibrous) stroma. Lymphovascular and perineural invasion are common. | Biliary obstruction, metastasis to lymph nodes and distant sites. | Tumor markers like CEA and CA19-9 may be elevated but are not specific. Diagnosis is primarily through imaging and biopsy. | 1. **Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma** 2. **Extrahepatic biliary adenocarcinoma** (includes perihilar/Klatskin tumors) | **Intrahepatic:** May be detected incidentally or present with a cholestatic picture or symptomatic liver mass.  **Extrahepatic:** Typically presents with symptoms of biliary obstruction (jaundice, pruritus, light stools, dark urine). | Surgical resection with negative margins is the only curative option. Adjuvant chemotherapy is often given but responses are transient. Overall prognosis is poor. |
| **Acute Cholecystitis** Acute inflammation of the gallbladder, almost always occurring in association with gallstones. | **Calculous (90%):** Precipitated by obstruction of the gallbladder neck or cystic duct by a gallstone.  **Acalculous (10%):** Thought to result from ischemia. | **Calculous:** Same risk factors as for gallstones (female, advancing age, obesity). Common in diabetic patients.  **Acalculous:** Seen in severely ill, hospitalized patients (sepsis, trauma, burns, immunosuppression). | 1. **Obstruction** leads to chemical irritation from concentrated bile. Mucosal phospholipases hydrolyze lecithins to toxic lysolecithins. 2. Disruption of the protective mucus layer exposes the mucosa to the detergent action of bile salts. 3. Gallbladder distention and release of prostaglandins contribute to inflammation and can compromise mucosal blood flow. 4. Bacterial infection may be superimposed later in the course. | - | Gallbladder is enlarged and tense, with a bright red or blotchy/violaceous to green-black color due to hemorrhage and necrosis. Serosa is often covered by a fibrinous exudate. The lumen is filled with turbid bile or pus (**empyema**). In severe cases, the wall is necrotic (**gangrenous cholecystitis**). | Early histologic changes are edema, congestion, and mucosal erosion. Neutrophilic infiltrate is typically sparse unless there is superimposed infection. | Gallbladder empyema, gangrenous cholecystitis, perforation, local abscess formation, peritonitis, biliary enteric fistula. | Leukocytosis, modestly elevated serum alkaline phosphatase. Presence of hyperbilirubinemia suggests common bile duct obstruction. | 1. **Acute Calculous Cholecystitis** (with stone) 2. **Acute Acalculous Cholecystitis** (without stone) | Progressive right upper quadrant or epigastric pain lasting > 6 hours, often associated with mild fever, anorexia, tachycardia, nausea, and vomiting. Symptoms of acalculous cholecystitis can be more insidious, obscured by the underlying severe illness. | Supportive care. Surgical removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is the definitive treatment and is often performed emergently. |
| **Cholelithiasis (Gallstones)** The presence of stones in the gallbladder. More than 95% of biliary tract disease is attributable to gallstones. | **Cholesterol stones:** Bile is supersaturated with cholesterol.  **Pigment stones:** Bile contains high levels of unconjugated bilirubin. | **Cholesterol stones:** Advancing age, female gender, oral contraceptives/pregnancy (estrogen), obesity, metabolic syndrome, rapid weight loss, gallbladder stasis. **Pigment stones:** Chronic hemolytic anemias, severe ileal dysfunction, bacterial or parasitic infection of the biliary tree. More common in Asian populations. | **Cholesterol stones:** Four conditions contribute: (1) supersaturation of bile with cholesterol, (2) gallbladder hypomotility (stasis), (3) accelerated cholesterol crystal nucleation, and (4) hypersecretion of mucus (traps crystals). **Pigment stones:** Elevated unconjugated bilirubin (either from hemolysis or bacterial deconjugation of bilirubin) precipitates with calcium to form stones. | Hereditary factors include gene variants encoding hepatocyte ATP-binding cassette (**ABC**) transporters, such as the **ABCG8** gene. | Gallstones are found within the gallbladder. The wall of the gallbladder is often thickened and fibrotic due to chronic cholecystitis. | **Cholesterol stones:** Pale yellow, round or ovoid, often faceted. Mostly radiolucent. **Pigment stones:** • **Black stones:** Small, brittle, spiculated, found in sterile bile. Radiopaque (50-75%). • **Brown stones:** Soft, laminated, soap-like, found in infected bile. Radiolucent. | Acute and chronic cholecystitis, empyema, perforation, cholangitis, pancreatitis, obstructive cholestasis. Small stones ("gravel") are most dangerous. Associated with increased risk of **gallbladder carcinoma**. | Diagnosis is usually made by abdominal ultrasound. | 1. **Cholesterol stones** (>50% cholesterol) 2. **Pigment stones** (bilirubin calcium salts) | 70-80% of patients remain asymptomatic for life. Symptomatic patients experience "biliary colic" - excruciating, constant right upper quadrant pain, often following a fatty meal. Nausea and vomiting may occur. | For symptomatic patients, cholecystectomy is the standard treatment. Asymptomatic stones are generally not treated. |
