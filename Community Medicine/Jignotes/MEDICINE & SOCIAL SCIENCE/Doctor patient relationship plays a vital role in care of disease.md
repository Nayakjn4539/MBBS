# [[MEDICINE & SOCIAL SCIENCE]] > Doctor patient relationship plays a vital role in care of disease

### Doctor-Patient Relationship in Social Medicine

The [[Doctor-Patient Relationship]] is a complex social interaction that forms the foundation of medical care. It is not merely a professional contract but a dynamic interpersonal connection that significantly influences the outcome of therapy.

#### 1. Nature of the Relationship
Sociologically, this relationship possesses characteristics of both **secondary** (business-like) and **primary** (personal) relationships.

| Perspective | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Physician's View** (Secondary) | • **Professional/Contractual:** A business deal starting with illness and ending with cure.<br>• **Transferable:** Another doctor can take over.<br>• **Specific:** Limited to the medical condition. |
| **Patient's View** (Primary) | • **Continuous:** Patients often stick to one "Family Doctor".<br>• **Emotional/Faith-based:** Involves trust and faith; treatment fails without it.<br>• **Non-transferable:** Patients prefer their specific doctor over a new one every visit. |

#### 2. Levels of Communication
A successful doctor is one who can communicate effectively across three distinct planes to establish a rapport and ensure [[compliance]].

*   **Communication on an Emotional Plane:**
    *   The doctor must lend a **sympathetic ear** to the patient's complaints.
    *   **Rapport** must be established quickly.
    *   *Why Folk Medicine Succeeds:* Folk practitioners often allow patients to talk freely, creating strong emotional bonds compared to modern physicians who may be too clinical.

*   **Communication on a Cultural Plane:**
    *   The doctor must understand the **social organization** and **cultural values** of the community.
    *   **Flexibility:** Scientific advice should be couched in terms that fit existing cultural patterns.
    *   *Example:* In communities believing in "Hot and Cold" diseases, a doctor should not openly challenge the belief. Instead, stating that a medicine is "Hot" and will cure a "Cold" disease increases confidence.

*   **Communication on an Intellectual Plane:**
    *   There is often a wide **Social Distance** between a sophisticated doctor and an illiterate patient.
    *   A successful doctor reduces this distance by communicating freely and using **Humor** (the best icebreaker for fear and anxiety).
    *   **Explanation:** The doctor must explain the diagnosis and treatment in language the patient understands, avoiding technical jargon.

> *   **C** - **C**ultural Plane (Respect beliefs)
> *   **E** - **E**motional Plane (Empathy)

#### 3. The "Sick Role" (Sociological Concept)
Illness is not just a biological condition; it is a social role. The patient (Host) behaves in prescribed ways when ill.

**Aspects of the Sick Role:**
1.  **Exemption:** The sick person is exempted from normal social responsibilities (e.g., work, school) depending on severity.
2.  **Care:** The person needs to be cared for.
3.  **Misfortune:** The role is regarded as a misfortune, and the patient is not held responsible for their condition.
4.  **Obligation:** The sick person is obliged to seek **competent medical help** and **cooperate** with the doctor to get well.

#### 4. Factors Affecting the Relationship
*   **Social Distance:** Differences in social class, education, and language between the doctor and patient can hinder communication.
*   **Expectations:** The public expects hospitals and doctors to provide "tender, loving care," not just technical cure.
*   **Specialization:** Over-specialization leads to fragmentation of care and depersonalization, straining the traditional relationship.
*   **Authority:** The doctor exercises an authoritative role by virtue of technical knowledge. Conflict arises if the patient is unwilling to invest the doctor with this authority.

#### Clinical Relevance
*   **Compliance:** A good relationship ensures the patient follows the prescribed regimen. Patients often labelled "uncooperative" are usually those with whom the doctor failed to communicate effectively.
*   **Placebo Effect:** The patient's faith in the doctor can have a therapeutic effect independent of the drug's pharmacological action (Psychoneuroimmunology).
*   **Social Therapy:** Understanding the patient's background allows the doctor to prescribe social remedies (e.g., advising a factory worker with anxiety about her children to use a crèche) alongside medical treatment.
