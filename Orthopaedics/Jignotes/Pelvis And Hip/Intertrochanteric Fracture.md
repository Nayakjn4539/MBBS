# [[Pelvis And Hip]] > Intertrochanteric Fracture

# Intertrochanteric Fracture

### Introduction and Definition
An [[Intertrochanteric fracture]] is an extracapsular fracture of the [[proximal femur]] occurring along the line between the [[greater trochanter]] and the [[lesser trochanter]],,. 
*   **Anatomical Extent:** It involves the cancellous bone between the trochanters and extends from the base of the femoral neck to the pertrochanteric region,.
*   **Nature:** Being **extracapsular**, the blood supply to the fracture fragments is usually abundant, derived from the cancellous bone surfaces and surrounding soft tissues,.
*   **Union Potential:** Unlike [[fracture neck of femur]], these fractures unite readily due to the rich blood supply. [[Non-union]] is rare (<2%),.
*   **Epidemiology:** Commonly seen in elderly patients (often >70 years) associated with [[senile osteoporosis]],.

### Mechanism of Injury
1.  **Elderly:** Trivial trauma, such as a slip and fall (low energy injury). The bones are often osteoporotic.
2.  **Young Adults:** High-velocity trauma, such as Road Traffic Accidents (RTA).

### Pathoanatomy and Deforming Forces
*   **Proximal Fragment:** The [[head of femur]] and neck are pulled into abduction and external rotation by the abductors and short external rotators.
*   **Distal Fragment:** The shaft is pulled medially (adducted) by the adductor muscles and proximally by the hamstrings and quadriceps, causing shortening. The [[iliopsoas]] (attached to the lesser trochanter) exerts a flexion force.
*   **Result:** The limb typically lies in marked **external rotation** and shortening.

**Clinical Implication:**
Because the fracture is extracapsular, the joint capsule does not restrict the rotation of the distal fragment. Therefore, the external rotation deformity is often **more profound (>45 degrees)** compared to intracapsular fractures where the capsule limits rotation,.

### Classification
#### 1. Evans Classification
This system is based on the stability of the fracture and the ability to convert an unstable fracture into a stable one,.
*   **Type I:** Fracture line extends upwards and outwards from the lesser trochanter.
    *   *Stable:* Undisplaced or displaced but reducible.
    *   *Unstable:* Commnution of the posteromedial cortex (calcar femorale) or reverse obliquity.
*   **Type II:** Fracture line extends downwards and outwards (Reverse Obliquity). These are inherently unstable due to the tendency of the medial shaft to shift medially.

#### 2. Boyd and Griffin Classification
Based on the ease of reduction and maintenance of reduction,.
*   **Type I:** Undisplaced fracture.
*   **Type II:** Stable fracture (intertrochanteric line).
*   **Type III:** Unstable (Posteromedial comminution).
*   **Type IV:** Subtrochanteric extension or reverse oblique fracture.

### Clinical Features
*   **Pain:** Severe pain in the hip/groin region, worse with movement.
*   **Tenderness:** Over the greater trochanter.
*   **Swelling:** Ecchymosis and swelling are usually present (extracapsular space allows hematoma expansion).
*   **Deformity:**
    *   **Shortening:** Supratrochanteric shortening is present.
    *   **External Rotation:** Gross external rotation (the lateral border of the foot may touch the bed),.
*   **Movement:** Inability to perform active straight leg raising (SLR).

### Investigations
*   **X-rays:**
    *   Standard AP view of the pelvis (showing both hips for comparison).
    *   Cross-table lateral view of the affected hip,.
*   **Observations on X-ray:**
    *   Fracture line between trochanters.
    *   Displacement and comminution.
    *   Lesser trochanter avulsion (indicates instability/posterior comminution).
    *   [[Singh index]] to grade [[osteoporosis]],.

### Comparison: Intracapsular vs. Extracapsular Hip Fractures

| Feature | Fracture Neck of Femur (Intracapsular) | Intertrochanteric Fracture (Extracapsular) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Age** | Elderly (60-70s) | Very Elderly (70-80s) |
| **Pain/Tenderness** | Mild to Moderate | Severe |
| **Shortening** | Mild (< 1 inch) | Moderate to Severe (> 1 inch) |
| **External Rotation** | Limited by capsule (<45°) | Gross (up to 90°) |
| **Blood Supply** | Precarious (Retinacular vessels disrupted) | Abundant (Cancellous bone) |
| **Malunion** | Rare | Common ([[Coxa vara]]) |
| **Non-union** | Common (20-30%) | Rare (<2%) |
| **Avascular Necrosis** | Common | Very Rare |
| **Mortality** | Lower | Higher (due to age/comorbidities) |

### Management

The goal is to fix the fracture securely to allow early mobilization, preventing complications of recumbency (bed sores, pneumonia),.

#### 1. Conservative Management
*   **Indications:** Rarely used today. Reserved for patients medically unfit for anesthesia/surgery or children,.
*   **Methods:**
    *   [[Skeletal traction]] (via upper tibial pin) on a [[Bohler-Braun splint]],.
    *   [[Russell’s traction]].
    *   Derotation boot (allows healing in malposition but prevents rotation).
*   **Disadvantages:** Prolonged bed rest (10-12 weeks), high mortality, malunion ([[Coxa vara]]), knee stiffness,.

#### 2. Operative Management (Standard of Care)
Principles: Accurate reduction + Rigid internal fixation,.

**A. Implant Selection**

| Fracture Type | Preferred Implant | Mechanism/Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stable Fractures** | [[Dynamic Hip Screw]] (DHS) | Allows "controlled collapse" or compression of fracture fragments as patient bears weight. Screw slides in the barrel,. |
| **Unstable Fractures** (Reverse oblique, subtrochanteric extension) | [[Proximal Femoral Nail]] (PFN) or Cephalomedullary Nails | Intramedullary device. Shorter lever arm, biomechanically stronger. Prevents excessive medialization of the shaft,. |
| **Alternative for Unstable** | [[Condylar blade plate]] or DCS | Used if PFN is technically difficult or fracture extends to piriformis fossa. |

**B. Surgical Techniques**
1.  **Closed Reduction:** Done on a fracture table under C-arm guidance.
2.  **Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS):**
    *   Involves a lag screw inserted into the femoral head/neck and a side plate attached to the femoral shaft.
    *   Ideally, the screw should be **central** or **posteroinferior** in the femoral head (Tip-Apex Distance < 25mm to prevent cut-out),.
3.  **Proximal Femoral Nail (PFN):**
    *   Inserted through the greater trochanter tip/piriformis fossa.
    *   Has proximal screws for neck fixation and distal locking bolts.
    *   Biologically superior (closed technique, less soft tissue stripping).

**Clinical Implication:**
In elderly osteoporotic patients, the hold of the screw in the femoral head is critical. If positioned poorly (superiorly), the screw may "cut out" through the femoral head, leading to fixation failure.

### Complications

#### General (Systemic)
Due to advanced age and immobilization:
*   [[Deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism,.
*   Hypostatic pneumonia.
*   Bed sores (Decubitus ulcers).
*   High mortality rate (>10-20%) within the first year.

#### Local (Orthopedic)
1.  **Malunion:**
    *   Most common complication.
    *   Fracture collapses into **[[Coxa vara]]** (decreased neck-shaft angle) causing shortening and limp,.
    *   External rotation deformity.
2.  **Implant Failure:**
    *   "Cut-out" of the screw from the head.
    *   Bending or breaking of the nail/plate.
    *   Z-effect or Reverse Z-effect in PFN.
3.  **Non-union:** Very rare (<2%).
4.  **Avascular Necrosis (AVN):** Very rare (0.8%) because the fracture is extracapsular.
5.  **Infection:** Post-operative.
