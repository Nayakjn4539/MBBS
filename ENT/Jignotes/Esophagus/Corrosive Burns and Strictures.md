# [[Esophagus]] > Corrosive Burns and Strictures

### Definition and Etiology

**Corrosive burns** of the [[esophagus]] result from the ingestion of strong chemical agents, leading to severe tissue damage, necrosis, and potential long-term sequelae like strictures.

*   **Epidemiology**:
    *   **Children**: Usually accidental ingestion.
    *   **Adults**: Usually suicidal intent, psychotic episodes, or alcoholism.
*   **Causative Agents**:
    *   **Alkalis** (e.g., drain cleaners, oven cleaners, lye, dishwasher detergents): More destructive. They cause **liquefaction necrosis**, allowing deep penetration into tissue layers. Severe cases can lead to sloughing of the entire esophagus and stomach.
    *   **Acids** (e.g., toilet cleaners, metal cleaners, sulfuric/hydrochloric acid): Cause **coagulation necrosis**, forming an eschar (coagulum) that may limit deeper penetration compared to alkalis.

### Pathophysiology

The severity of injury depends on the nature, quantity, concentration, and duration of contact of the corrosive agent.

**Stages of Esophageal Burns:**
1.  **Stage of Acute Necrosis**: Immediate tissue death and inflammation.
2.  **Stage of Granulation**: Separation of slough occurs, leaving a granulating ulcer. This is the period where the esophageal wall is weakest.
3.  **Stage of Stricture**: Fibrosis and scar formation begin around **2 weeks** and may continue for 2 months or longer.

### Clinical Features

*   **History**: Ingestion of corrosive substance.
*   **Pain**: Oropharyngeal, retrosternal, or epigastric pain.
*   **Dysphagia/Odynophagia**: Difficulty or pain upon swallowing.
*   **Oral Signs**: Burns on lips, face, and oral cavity. *Note: The absence of oral burns does not rule out esophageal injury*.
*   **Respiratory**: [[Stridor]], hoarseness, or dyspnea indicates laryngeal edema or upper airway obstruction.
*   **Systemic**: Shock, tachycardia, fever.
*   **Advanced signs**: Signs of [[mediastinitis]] or [[peritonitis]] (chest pain, abdominal rigidity) suggest perforation.

### Grading of Injury (Zargar's Classification)

This is determined via endoscopy and helps predict prognosis.

| Grade | Endoscopic Findings | Prognosis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | Normal examination | No sequelae |
| **1** | Mucosal edema and hyperemia | Good; no stricture |
| **2A** | Superficial ulcers, bleeding, exudates | Good; no stricture |
| **2B** | Deep focal or circumferential ulcers | Stricture likely |
| **3A** | Focal necrosis (brown/black/gray spots) | High stricture risk |
| **3B** | Extensive necrosis | High mortality (65%) |
| **4** | Perforation | Surgical emergency |

### Diagnosis and Investigations

1.  **X-rays (Chest and Neck)**:
    *   To detect **perforation** (pneumomediastinum, surgical emphysema, gas under diaphragm).
    *   To assess pulmonary status (aspiration pneumonia).
2.  **Upper GI Endoscopy ([[Esophagoscopy]])**:
    *   **Timing**: Should be done early (within 24–48 hours) to assess extent and grade of injury.
    *   **Precaution**: Do **not** pass the scope beyond the first severe circumferential burn to avoid iatrogenic perforation.
    *   **Contraindication**: Some sources suggest avoiding after 12–24 hours due to wall softening, or if perforation is suspected.

### Management

#### 1. Immediate/Acute Management
*   **Airway**: Secure airway immediately. [[Tracheostomy]] or intubation may be required for laryngeal edema.
*   **Resuscitation**: IV fluids and electrolytes to treat shock and acid-base imbalance.
*   **Neutralization**: **CONTRAINDICATED**. Do not use weak acids/alkalis to neutralize as the chemical reaction generates heat (exothermic), causing further tissue damage.
*   **Emesis**: **CONTRAINDICATED**. Inducing vomiting re-exposes the esophagus to the corrosive.
*   **Gastric Lavage**: Generally avoided due to perforation risk.
*   **Nasogastric Tube**: Gently passed to maintain lumen patency and for feeding.

#### 2. Medical Therapy
*   **Antibiotics**: Broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics (e.g., Ampicillin, Cephalosporins) are given for 3–6 weeks to prevent secondary infection and mediastinitis.
*   **Corticosteroids**:
    *   **Role**: Controversial. Historically used to inhibit fibroblastic activity and prevent stricture formation.
    *   **Regimen**: Started within 48–96 hours (e.g., Prednisolone/Dexamethasone) and continued for 4–6 weeks.
    *   **Evidence**: Many studies find them not useful, but they are still prescribed in some protocols for Grade 2B injuries.

#### 3. Monitoring
*   **Follow-up**: Esophagogram (Barium swallow) and endoscopy every 2 weeks during healing to monitor for stricture development.

### Corrosive Strictures (Chronic Phase)

If deep burns occur, granulation tissue contracts leading to **esophageal stricture**. Stricture formation typically begins at 2 weeks.

#### Clinical Features
*   **Progressive Dysphagia**: Initially for solids, progressing to liquids.
*   **Regurgitation**: Of undigested food.
*   **Weight Loss**: Malnutrition due to inability to eat.

#### Diagnosis
*   **[[Barium Swallow]]**: Shows the number, extent, and severity of strictures (smooth tapering, often multiple or long segments).
*   **Endoscopy**: To rule out malignancy and assess lumen for dilatation.

#### Treatment of Strictures
1.  **Dilatation (First Line)**:
    *   **Prograde Dilatation**: Using bougies (e.g., Savary-Gilliard) or balloon dilators under endoscopic vision or fluoroscopy.
    *   **Retrograde Dilatation**: In tight strictures or children, a string is swallowed and retrieved via a [[gastrostomy]]. Tucker’s bougies are linked to the string and pulled upwards from the stomach (safer method).
2.  **Surgery**: Indicated if dilatation fails, stricture is impermeable, or multiple/long strictures exist.
    *   **Procedures**: Esophageal reconstruction or bypass using **stomach pull-up**, **colonic transposition**, or **jejunum**.

### Complications

*   **Early**:
    *   Laryngeal edema (Asphyxia).
    *   Esophageal Perforation $\rightarrow$ [[Mediastinitis]], Pericarditis, Empyema.
    *   Tracheoesophageal fistula.
*   **Late**:
    *   **Stricture formation**: The most common late complication.
    *   **Carcinoma**: Increased risk of **[[Squamous Cell Carcinoma]]** of the esophagus at the stricture site (scar carcinoma) developing decades later (latency 20–40 years).

**Mnemonic for Acute Management: NO VOMIT**
*   **N**o neutralization
*   **O**xygen/Airway
*   **V**enous access (IV fluids)
*   **O**esophagoscopy (Early)
*   **M**onitoring (Vitals, urine output)
*   **I**nfection control (Antibiotics)
*   **T**ube (Nasogastric for feeding)
