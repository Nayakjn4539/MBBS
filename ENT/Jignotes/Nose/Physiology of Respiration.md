# Physiology of Respiration in the Nose

The nose is the natural pathway for breathing, acting as the "guardian" of the lower respiratory tract. While mouth breathing is possible, it is an acquired act; the nose is the physiological route that prepares the air for the lungs.

The primary physiological functions of the nose regarding respiration include:
1.  **Nasal Airflow and Resistance**
2.  **Air Conditioning** (Warming and Humidification)
3.  **Filtration and Protection** (Mucociliary clearance)
4.  **Nasal Reflexes**
5.  **Vocal Resonance**

### 1. Nasal Airflow Dynamics

The nose contributes approximately **50% of the total airway resistance** to breathing. This resistance is crucial for maintaining the elasticity of the lungs and ensuring adequate gas exchange.

#### Pathway of Air
*   **Inspiration:** The main current of airflow passes through the **middle part of the nose** (between the [[nasal septum]] and the [[inferior turbinate]]/[[middle turbinate]]) in a high parabolic curve. Only a small fraction (approx. 10-15%) reaches the [[olfactory cleft]] for smell perception (requiring sniffing to increase this fraction).
*   **Expiration:** Friction offered at the [[limen nasi]] converts the airstream into **eddies** under the cover of the inferior and middle turbinates. These eddy currents are responsible for the **ventilation of the [[paranasal sinuses]]** through their ostia.

#### Types of Flow
*   **Laminar Flow:** Generally occurs at the [[nasal valve]] area and during quiet respiration (velocity approx. 12–18 m/s).
*   **Turbulent Flow:** Occurs in the main nasal cavity due to the irregular shape of the turbinates. Turbulence increases the surface area contact between the air and the mucosa, facilitating air conditioning.

#### Nasal Resistance and Valves
The nose acts as a resistor, regulated by three main components:
1.  **Nasal Vestibule:** Acts as the external nasal valve; has compliant walls that prevent collapse.
2.  **Internal Nasal Valve:** The narrowest part of the airway, formed by the caudal border of the [[upper lateral cartilage]], the [[nasal septum]], and the anterior end of the [[inferior turbinate]]. It regulates flow and resistance.
3.  **Turbinates:** The erectile tissue of the turbinates (regulated by the autonomic nervous system) swells or shrinks to alter resistance.

**Physics of Airflow:**
*   **Bernoulli’s Principle:** Increased air velocity through a narrow segment (like the nasal valve) leads to decreased lateral pressure.
*   **Poiseuille’s Law:** Flow is proportional to the 4th power of the radius. Small changes in mucosal swelling (radius) cause massive changes in airflow.

> **Clinical Implication:** [[Nasal obstruction]] leads to mouth breathing. Since the mouth cannot temper or filter air as effectively as the nose, this predisposes the patient to pharyngitis, laryngitis, and lower respiratory tract infections. In children, chronic obstruction can lead to pulmonary hypertension or [[cor pulmonale]].

### 2. Air Conditioning (The "Radiator" Mechanism)

The nose processes inspired air to protect the delicate alveolar lining. Even if the outside air is freezing ($0^\circ\text{C}$) or extremely hot, it is brought to near body temperature within the **0.25 seconds** it takes to pass through the nose.

#### Warming (Temperature Regulation)
*   **Mechanism:** The large surface area provided by the turbinates is lined with highly vascular mucosa containing **cavernous venous sinusoids** (erectile tissue).
*   **Counter-Current Mechanism:** This is a highly efficient heat exchange system. The flow of blood in the mucosa is from **Posterior to Anterior**, while the airflow is **Anterior to Posterior**. This gradient ensures maximum heat transfer.
*   **Result:** Inspired air is warmed to approximately **37°C** (body temperature). Conversely, hot air is cooled.

#### Humidification
*   **Source:** Moisture is provided by the secretion from seromucous glands, goblet cells, and transudation of fluid from blood vessels.
*   **Mechanism:** Evaporation of moisture from the mucous blanket saturates the air.
*   **Volume:** Approximately **1000 mL** (1 Liter) of water is evaporated from the nasal mucosa daily.
*   **Result:** Relative humidity of inspired air is raised to **75–95%** (some sources say near saturation) before reaching the nasopharynx.

> **Clinical Implication:** In patients with a [[tracheostomy]] or [[laryngectomy]], the air bypasses the nose. This results in dry, cold air reaching the trachea, causing crusting (crust formation), ciliary damage, and metaplasia of the tracheal epithelium (squamous metaplasia). This is why Heat and Moisture Exchangers (HME) are used.

### 3. Filtration and Protection

The nose acts as the first line of defense for the respiratory system.

| Mechanism | Particle Size Filtered | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vibrissae** | > 3 $\mu$m (Coarse) | Stiff hairs in the [[nasal vestibule]] filter large particles (lint, insects). |
| **Mucous Blanket** | 0.5 – 3.0 $\mu$m | Fine particles (bacteria, pollen, dust) adhere to the sticky mucus layer due to electrostatic attraction. |
| **Bypassed** | < 0.5 $\mu$m | Very fine particles may pass through the nose into the lower airways. |

#### Mucociliary Clearance Mechanism
The respiratory mucosa is lined by **pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium**.
*   **The Mucous Blanket:** Consists of two layers:
    1.  **Sol Layer (Periciliary layer):** Thin, watery, deep layer in which cilia beat freely.
    2.  **Gel Layer:** Thick, viscous, superficial layer that traps particles.
*   **Ciliary Action:** Cilia beat at a frequency of **10–20 Hz (beats/second)**. They have a rapid "effective stroke" (contacting the Gel layer) and a slow "recovery stroke" (in the Sol layer).
*   **Direction of Flow:** The mucus is propelled backward towards the [[nasopharynx]], where it is swallowed and destroyed by gastric acid. The rate of transport is **5–10 mm/minute**. The entire mucus sheet is replaced every 10–20 minutes.

**Chemical Protection:**
Nasal secretions contain:
*   **Muramidase (Lysozyme):** Bacteriolytic enzyme.
*   **Immunoglobulins:** Specifically secretory [[IgA]] and [[IgE]].
*   **Interferon:** Antiviral protection.
*   **Lactoferrin:** Bacteriostatic.

> **Clinical Implication:** **[[Kartagener’s syndrome]]** (Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia) involves a defect in the dynein arms of cilia, leading to immotile cilia. This causes stagnation of mucus, resulting in the triad of [[situs inversus]], [[bronchiectasis]], and chronic [[sinusitis]].

### 4. The Nasal Cycle

The nasal cycle is a physiologic, rhythmic, alternating congestion and decongestion of the nasal turbinates (erectile tissue) controlled by the **hypothalamus** via the autonomic nervous system.

*   **Pattern:** While one nostril is in the "working" phase (vasoconstriction/patent), the other is in the "resting" phase (vasodilation/congested).
*   **Duration:** The cycle alternates every **2.5 to 4 hours** (range 2–7 hours).
*   **Function:** It allows the "resting" side to rehydrate and accumulate mucus while the other side handles the main airflow. Total resistance remains constant.
*   **Influencing Factors:**
    *   **Posture:** Dependent side congests (due to hydrostatic pressure).
    *   **Emotion/Exercise:** Sympathetic stimulation (exercise, fear) causes decongestion; Parasympathetic (relaxation) causes congestion.
    *   **Environment:** Cold air causes congestion; humidity changes affect the cycle.

### 5. Nasal Reflexes

The nose is equipped with rich sensory innervation ([[trigeminal nerve]]) and autonomic supply, initiating several reflexes:

1.  **Sneezing Reflex:** A protective reflex to expel foreign particles or irritants. Stimulation of nerve endings causes a deep inspiration followed by a violent expiration against a closed glottis, which then opens suddenly.
2.  **Nasobronchial Reflex:** Stimulation or obstruction of the nose can cause reflex bronchoconstriction and increased pulmonary resistance. Treating nasal obstruction often improves pulmonary function.
3.  **Nasopulmonary Reflex:** Severe nasal stimulation can cause apnea or bradycardia.

---

### 6. Vocal Resonance

While primarily a respiratory organ, the nose acts as a **resonating chamber** for phonation.
*   It is essential for the production of nasal consonants (M, N, NG).
*   **Rhinolalia Clausa (Hyponasality):** Seen in nasal obstruction (e.g., [[common cold]], [[nasal polyps]], [[adenoids]]). 'M' sounds like 'B', 'N' sounds like 'D'.
*   **Rhinolalia Aperta (Hypernasality):** Seen in [[velopharyngeal insufficiency]] or [[cleft palate]].

### Summary of Sinus Physiology
*   **Ventilation:** Occurs paradoxically. Sinuses empty during inspiration (negative pressure) and fill/ventilate during expiration (positive pressure/eddy currents).
*   **Drainage:** Cilia in the sinuses are programmed to beat toward the natural ostium, often against gravity (e.g., in the [[maxillary sinus]]). Creating an artificial window (like in Caldwell-Luc) does not change this natural direction; mucus will still attempt to bypass the new opening to reach the natural ostium.
