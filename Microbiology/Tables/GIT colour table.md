| Clostridioides difficile Infection | Clostridioides difficile | Obligate anaerobic, gram-positive, spore-forming bacillus. | A hypervirulent epidemic strain, ribotype BI/NAP1/027, has been described. | Production of two powerful exotoxins: Toxin A (enterotoxin) and Toxin B (cytotoxin). Spores are widely found in nature. Hypervirulent strain produces higher levels of toxins. | **Risk factors:** Prolonged hospital stay and antimicrobial use, which disrupts normal colonic flora. Spores are ingested and germinate in the colon. Only toxigenic strains cause disease. Outcome determined by host immune response to toxins. | **Toxin A and Toxin B:** Glycosylate GTP-binding proteins that regulate the cellular actin cytoskeleton.
