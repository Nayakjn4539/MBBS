# Sources of Health Information

A [[Health Information System]] acts as the nervous system of public health management. It provides the data necessary for planning, implementation, and evaluation of health services.

The sources of health statistics are varied, depending on the administrative level and the specific data required.

### **Mnemonic: "MR. C. H. PANDERS"**
(To remember the major sources)
*   **M** - Manpower Statistics
*   **R** - Registration of Vital Events
*   **C** - Census
*   **H** - Hospital Records
*   **P** - Population Surveys
*   **A** - (Other) Agencies & Environmental Health Data
*   **N** - Notification of Diseases
*   **D** - Disease Registers
*   **E** - Epidemiological Surveillance
*   **R** - Record Linkage
*   **S** - Sample Registration System (SRS)

### 1. Census
The census is the most important source of health information and provides the **denominator** for calculating various health rates and indicators.
*   **Definition:** The total process of collecting, compiling, and publishing demographic, economic, and social data at a specified time to all persons in a country.
*   **Frequency:** In India, it is conducted every **10 years** (First regular census: 1881).
*   **Data collected:**
    *   Total population size.
    *   Age and sex distribution (Crucial for [[Population Pyramid]]).
    *   Social/Economic characteristics (Literacy, Occupation).
*   **Limitation:** Data is available only intermittently (every decade), delaying the analysis of rapid changes.

### 2. Registration of Vital Events
*   **Definition:** Legal registration, statistical recording, and reporting of vital events like [[Live Births]], [[Deaths]], marriages, and divorces.
*   **Significance:** It keeps a continuous check on demographic changes. It is considered the foundation of vital statistics.
*   **Legal Framework in India:** The **Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969** makes reporting compulsory.
    *   **Births:** Register within **21 days**.
    *   **Deaths:** Register within **21 days**.
*   **Limitation:** In many developing countries, including parts of India, the system suffers from under-reporting and inaccuracy.

### 3. Sample Registration System (SRS)
Developed to overcome the deficiencies of the Civil Registration System. It is the main source of reliable estimates of birth and death rates in India.
*   **Mechanism (Dual Record System):**
    1.  **Continuous Enumeration:** By a part-time enumerator (local resident).
    2.  **Independent Retrospective Survey:** Every 6 months by a supervisor.
*   **Process:** The results from both methods are matched, and discrepancies are verified in the field to get an accurate count.
*   **Key Indicators Provided:** [[Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)]], Birth Rate, Death Rate, Maternal Mortality Ratio.

### 4. Notification of Diseases
*   **Purpose:** To control and prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
*   **Procedure:** Certain diseases are considered "Notifiable" by law. Doctors, health workers, or heads of families must report them to local health authorities.
*   **International Health Regulations (IHR):**
    *   Diseases strictly notifiable to [[WHO]]: **Cholera, Plague, Yellow Fever**.
    *   Diseases under WHO surveillance: Polio, Influenza, Malaria, Rabies.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   **Tip of the Iceberg:** Notification covers only a small part of total sickness (clinical cases); subclinical cases and carriers are often missed.
    *   Under-reporting due to lack of diagnostic facilities.

### 5. Hospital Records
*   **Nature:** Constitutes a basic and primary source of information.
*   **Data:** Discharge sheets provide info on diagnosis, length of stay, surgical procedures, and cost.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Highly selective (Admission bias/ [[Berksonian Bias]]): Only severe cases reach hospitals.
    *   Denominator (population at risk) cannot be defined accurately.
    *   Not representative of the general community health status.

### 6. Disease Registers
*   **Definition:** A permanent record established for specific diseases where cases are followed up for a long duration.
*   **Usage:** Commonly used for chronic or major conditions like **Tuberculosis (TB), Leprosy, Cancer, Stroke, and Blindness**.
*   **Benefits:** Provides data on incidence, duration of illness, case fatality, and survival rates.

### 7. Record Linkage
*   **Concept:** The process of bringing together records relating to one individual from different times or places.
*   **Medical Record Linkage:** Assembling birth, marriage, death, and hospital records into a single file for an individual.
*   **Utility:** Excellent for studying associations between diseases and chronic disease epidemiology.

### 8. Epidemiological Surveillance
*   **Definition:** Continuous scrutiny of factors that determine the occurrence and distribution of disease.
*   **Scope:** Includes monitoring mortality/morbidity reports, laboratory investigations, and field reports.
*   **Programs:** [[Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP)]] in India integrates data from various levels.

### 9. Population Surveys
Surveys supplement routine statistics by providing information on health status, morbidity, and factors affecting health.
*   **Types:**
    1.  **Health Interview Surveys:** Face-to-face (e.g., National Sample Survey Organization - NSSO).
    2.  **Health Examination Surveys:** Includes clinical/lab exams; more valid but expensive.
*   **Major Surveys in India:**
    *   **[[National Family Health Survey (NFHS)]]:** Provides essential data on fertility, family planning, mortality, and maternal/child health.
    *   **District Level Household Survey (DLHS):** Reproductive and child health data.

### 10. Other Sources
*   **Environmental Health Data:** Statistics on air/water pollution, industrial toxicants, and sanitation.
*   **Health Manpower Statistics:** Records of physicians, nurses, and paramedical staff maintained by state councils.
*   **Non-quantifiable Information:** Health policies, legislation, public attitudes, and program procedures.

### Comparison of Major Sources

| Source | Key Feature | Best Used For | Limitation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Census** | Complete enumeration | Population denominator, Demographic data | Occurs only once in 10 years |
| **Registration** | Legal requirement | Birth/Death counts | Under-reporting in developing areas |
| **SRS** | Dual-record system | Reliable Birth/Death Rates & IMR in India | Sample-based, not total count |
| **Hospital Records**| Clinical data | Outcome of medical care, morbidity | Selection bias (Tip of iceberg) |
| **Surveys** | Targeted study | Disease prevalence, Health needs | Expensive, cross-sectional snapshot |

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Community Diagnosis:** A Medical Officer uses these sources (Census for population, Hospital records for morbidity) to prioritize health problems in their Primary Health Centre (PHC) area.
*   **Outbreak Investigation:** Notification data is the first trigger for investigating epidemics (e.g., Cholera or Dengue outbreaks).
*   **Program Evaluation:** SRS and Surveys (NFHS) are critical to track the success of national programs like the National Health Mission (NHM).
