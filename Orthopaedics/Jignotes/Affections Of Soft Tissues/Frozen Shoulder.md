# Frozen Shoulder (Adhesive Capsulitis / Periarthritis)

### Definition and Terminology
**Frozen Shoulder**, clinically referred to as [[Adhesive Capsulitis]] or [[Periarthritis]], is a well-defined disorder characterized by progressive pain and stiffness of the shoulder which usually resolves spontaneously after about 18 months.

*   It is a condition characterized by global restriction of movements.
*   It involves inflammation and fibrosis of the [[Glenohumeral joint]] capsule.

### Etiology and Risk Factors
While the exact cause and pathogenesis are topics of debate, certain associations are well established:
*   **Diabetes Mellitus:** There is a strong association with [[Diabetes Mellitus]]. Good glycemic control is essential for spontaneous resolution.
*   **Trauma:** Can be a precipitating factor.
*   **Idiopathic:** Often occurs without a clear precipitating event.

### Clinical Features
The diagnosis is primarily based on clinical examination.

#### Symptoms
*   **Pain:**
    *   Acute pain is a primary feature, especially in the early stages.
    *   Pain is noted at the end stage of stretch.
    *   Pain distribution is typically over the [[Deltoid]] region.
*   **Stiffness:** Progressive loss of movement.
*   **Functional Limitation:** Patients are unable to perform routine daily activities such as:
    *   Combing hair.
    *   Fastening buttons of a blouse (in women).
    *   Performing overhead activities.

#### Signs
*   **Range of Motion (ROM):**
    *   **Decreased Range:** There is a decrease in both **active** and **passive** shoulder movements.
    *   **Global Restriction:** Movement is restricted in all planes.
    *   **Capsular Pattern:** The patient demonstrates a specific pattern of restriction where **External Rotation** is most limited, followed by **Abduction**, and then **Internal Rotation**.
    *   **Earliest Sign:** Restriction of rotation (External > Internal) is the earliest movement to be restricted.
*   **Accessory Joint Play:** This is reduced.
*   **Resistive Tests:** Generally pain-free within the available range of motion.

### Clinical Stages
According to Reeves, the natural history is divided into three classic stages.

| Stage | Name | Duration | Clinical Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stage I** | **Stage of Pain** | 10–36 weeks | • Acute pain.<br>• Decreased movements.<br>• **External rotation** is lost first and most severely, followed by abduction and forward flexion.<br>• Internal rotation is least affected. |
| **Stage II** | **Stage of Stiffness** | Variable | • Pain may subside but stiffness remains or increases.<br>• "Frozen" phase. |
| **Stage III** | **Stage of Recovery** | Variable | • "Thawing" phase.<br>• Gradual return of range of motion. |

### Relevant Anatomy: The Rotator Cuff
Understanding the surrounding musculature is vital as pathology here can mimic frozen shoulder. The [[Rotator Cuff]] consists of four interrelated muscles arising from the [[Scapula]].

**Mnemonic: SITS**
*   **S**upraspinatus
*   **I**nfraspinatus
*   **T**eres Minor
*   **S**ubscapularis

### Diagnosis and Investigations
*   **Clinical Examination:** Usually sufficient for diagnosis based on the capsular pattern of restriction.
*   **X-rays:** usually **Normal** in frozen shoulder. They are primarily done to rule out other bony pathologies like arthritis or tumors.
*   **MRI:** May show thickening of the [[Coracohumeral Ligament]] and joint capsule obliteration, though often reserved for complex cases.

### Differential Diagnosis
It is crucial to differentiate frozen shoulder from other painful shoulder conditions:
1.  **Impingement Syndrome:** Painful arc syndrome; usually pain between 60-120 degrees of abduction.
2.  **Cervical Spondylosis:** Radiating pain from the neck.
3.  **Shoulder Arthritis:**
    *   **Glenohumeral Arthritis:** Mechanical restriction due to joint destruction.
    *   **Acromioclavicular Arthritis:** Localized tenderness over the AC joint.
4.  **Tuberculosis of Shoulder:** Should be considered in endemic areas.

### Treatment
Treatment is divided into general and specific measures.

#### General Management
*   **Glycemic Control:** Spontaneous resolution is aided by good control of [[Diabetes Mellitus]].
*   **Physiotherapy:** Essential to maintain and regain range of motion.
*   **Analgesia:** NSAIDs for pain relief.

#### Specific Interventions
If conservative measures fail, the following may be indicated:
1.  **Steroid Injections:** Intra-articular [[Corticosteroids]] can reduce inflammation and pain.
2.  **Manipulation Under Anesthesia (MUA):** Forcing the joint through a range of motion to break adhesions.
3.  **Adhesiolysis:** Surgical release of adhesions.
4.  **Arthroscopic Release:** Minimally invasive surgical release of the tight capsule.
