# [[Legal Procedures]] > Courts in india their levels and powers

### **Courts of Law in India**

The administration of justice in India is carried out through a hierarchy of courts. Broadly, they are classified into two types:
1.  **Civil Courts:** Deal with disputes between private parties (e.g., property, divorce, damages).
2.  **Criminal Courts:** Deal with cases involving crimes against the state/society (e.g., murder, rape, theft).

In [[Forensic Medicine]], we are primarily concerned with **Criminal Courts** as medical evidence is most frequently required there.

### **Hierarchy and Powers of Criminal Courts**

The criminal courts are constituted under the **Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC)** (now transitioning to **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita - BNSS**).

#### **1. Supreme Court of India**
*   **Level:** Apex court of the country (located in New Delhi).
*   **Powers:**
    *   Highest court of appeal.
    *   Can pass **any sentence** authorized by law.
    *   Its decisions are binding on all other courts in India.

#### **2. High Court**
*   **Level:** Highest court in a State.
*   **Powers:**
    *   Can try any offence.
    *   Can pass **any sentence** authorized by law.
    *   Commutation of death sentence (from Sessions Court) is confirmed here.

#### **3. Sessions Courts**
Located at the District level. Presided over by a Sessions Judge.

| Designation | Sentencing Power (Imprisonment) | Fine | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sessions Judge** / **Additional Sessions Judge** | **Any sentence** authorized by law. | Unlimited | **Death Sentence** passed by him must be confirmed by the [[High Court]] before execution. |
| **Assistant Sessions Judge** | Up to **10 years**. | Unlimited | Cannot pass death sentence or life imprisonment. |

### **4. Magistrate Courts**
The terminology differs based on the population of the area.
*   **Metropolitan Area:** Population > 1 million (e.g., Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai).
*   **District Area:** Other areas.

#### **A. Judicial Magistrates (Conduct Trials)**

| Level | Designation (District) | Designation (Metropolitan) | Power of Imprisonment | Power of Fine |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Highest** | **Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM)** | **Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM)** | Up to **7 years** | Unlimited |
| **First Level** | **Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC)** | **Metropolitan Magistrate (MM)** | Up to **3 years** | Up to ₹ 10,000* |
| **Second Level**| **Judicial Magistrate Second Class (JM-II)** | (Not usually designated in Metros) | Up to **1 year** | Up to ₹ 5,000* |

*(Note: Under the new Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita/BNSS, fine limits and community service provisions are being updated, but standard textbooks currently reflect CrPC values listed above).*

#### **B. Executive Magistrates (Administrative Functions)**
These are appointed by the State Government. They maintain law and order and conduct specific inquests. They **do not** conduct criminal trials.

*   **Designations:** District Magistrate (Collector/Deputy Commissioner), Sub-Divisional Magistrate (RDO/SDM), Tahsildar.
*   **Powers:**
    *   Conduct [[Inquest]] (Magistrate Inquest) in cases of custodial deaths, dowry deaths, and exhumation.
    *   Power to order **Exhumation**.
    *   Cannot pass sentences of imprisonment for crimes (administrative powers only).

### **5. Special Courts**

*   **Juvenile Justice Board (Juvenile Court):**
    *   Deals with offenses committed by children (**< 18 years**).
    *   Focus is on correction and rehabilitation, not punishment.
    *   Presided over by a Principal Magistrate (usually a JMFC) and two social workers (one must be female).
*   **Fast Track Courts:** For speedy disposal of cases (e.g., sexual offenses).

### **Mnemonic for Powers**

**"Seven-Three-One" Rule for Magistrates**
*   **C**hief = **7** years (C looks like inverted 7)
*   **F**irst Class = **3** years
*   **S**econd Class = **1** year

**"Ten" for Assistant**
*   **A**ssistant Sessions Judge = **10** years (A is the 1st letter, 1 and 0 = 10).

### **Medicolegal Aspects**

1.  **Jurisdiction:** A doctor must attend the court that summons him. If summoned by two courts for the same date:
    *   **Criminal Court** has priority over **Civil Court**.
    *   **Higher Court** has priority over **Lower Court** (e.g., Sessions over Magistrate).
2.  **Conduct Money:**
    *   **Civil Cases:** Paid to the doctor/witness to cover travel/expenses (Compulsory).
    *   **Criminal Cases:** No conduct money is paid by the accused or complainant. The State pays allowances as per rules (since it is a duty to the state).
3.  **Subpoena:** A summons from any of these courts must be obeyed. Failure to attend can lead to a bailable or non-bailable warrant (Section 350 CrPC).
4.  **Death Sentence:** While a Sessions Judge can award a death sentence, it is **not operational** until confirmed by the High Court (Section 366 CrPC).
