# [[Clinical Examination]] > Examination of Ankle and Foot

### General Approach to Clinical Assessment

The examination of the ankle and foot requires a systematic approach involving the classic triad: **Look, Feel, and Move**. Given that the foot acts as a unified functional unit with the ankle, deformities or pathology in one region often affect the other. The examination must include the patient standing, walking, and lying down.

#### History Taking
Before touching the patient, listen to the history. Key symptoms include:
*   **Pain:** Localize accurately (e.g., heel, forefoot, or diffuse).
*   **Deformity:** Ask if it is congenital or acquired.
*   **Swelling:** Is it constant or related to activity?
*   **Instability:** Does the ankle "give way"? This suggests ligamentous incompetence or loose bodies.
*   **Shoe Wear:** Ask about uneven wear patterns on footwear, which can indicate gait abnormalities.

### 1. Inspection (Look)

**A. Gait Analysis**
Observe the patient walking barefoot. Note the foot progression angle and the phases of gait.
*   **Antalgic Gait:** Short stance phase on the painful side.
*   **High-stepping Gait:** Indicates a [[Drop foot]] (common peroneal nerve injury) where the patient lifts the leg high to clear the ground.
*   **Trendelenburg Gait:** Though a hip sign, it affects foot placement.

**B. Standing Position**
Examine from the front and back.
*   **Heel Alignment:** Normally, heels are in slight **valgus** (5-10°).
    *   **Varus Heel:** Seen in [[Pes cavus]] (high arch) and [[Clubfoot]] (CTEV).
    *   **Valgus Heel:** Seen in [[Pes planus]] (flat foot).
*   **Too Many Toes Sign:** When viewing the patient from behind, seeing more toes on the lateral side than normal suggests **forefoot abduction**, characteristic of acquired [[Pes planus]] due to [[Tibialis posterior]] dysfunction.
*   **Tip-Toe Test:** Ask the patient to stand on tiptoes. In a normal flexible flat foot, the heel should invert (swing inward). If it remains in valgus, the deformity is rigid.

**C. Sitting/Supine Position**
*   **Skin:** Look for callosities (indicating pressure points), corns, or trophic ulcers (common in [[Diabetic neuropathy]]).
*   **Swelling:** Differentiate between diffuse swelling (edema/systemic) and localized swelling (ganglion, bursitis).
*   **Deformities:**
    *   **[[Hallux Valgus]]:** Lateral deviation of the great toe.
    *   **[[Hammer Toe]]:** Flexion deformity of the PIP joint.
    *   **[[Claw Toe]]:** Hyperextension of MTP joint and flexion of IP joints.

### 2. Palpation (Feel)

Palpate for temperature, tenderness, and pulses.

**A. Tenderness Points**
*   **Medial Malleolus/Deltoid Ligament:** Tenderness here suggests medial injury.
*   **Lateral Malleolus/ATFL:** Tenderness anterior and inferior to the lateral malleolus suggests [[Anterior Talofibular Ligament]] injury (common sprain).
*   **Base of 5th Metatarsal:** Tenderness here may indicate a fracture (Jones fracture) or avulsion by the [[Peroneus brevis]].
*   **[[Sinus Tarsi]]:** A soft spot anterolateral to the lateral malleolus; tenderness suggests subtalar pathology.
*   **[[Anatomical Snuffbox]] of the Foot:** Tenderness here may indicate navicular pathology.

**B. Neurovascular Status**
*   **Pulses:** Palpate the [[Dorsalis pedis]] (dorsum of foot) and [[Posterior tibial artery]] (behind medial malleolus). Note that the Dorsalis pedis is absent in ~15% of normal people.
*   **Sensation:** Test dermatomes, particularly looking for stocking anesthesia in diabetics.

### 3. Movements (Move)

Assess both active and passive range of motion (ROM).

| Joint | Movement | Normal Range | Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ankle Joint** | Dorsiflexion | 0–20° | Limited in tight [[Achilles tendon]] or bony impingement. |
| | Plantarflexion | 0–50° | Painful in anterior ankle impingement. |
| **Subtalar Joint** | Inversion | 0–30° | Assessed by stabilizing the talus and rocking the calcaneum. |
| | Eversion | 0–15° | Limited in subtalar arthritis or coalition. |
| **Midtarsal Joint** | Adduction/Abduction | Variable | Combined movement with subtalar joint. |

> **Clinical Implication:** Always compare ROM with the unaffected side to determine what is "normal" for that specific patient.

### 4. Special Tests

#### A. Tests for Ligamentous Instability
These tests assess the integrity of the lateral ligament complex (ATFL and CFL).

**1. Anterior Drawer Test (Ankle)**
*   **Method:** Patient seated with knee flexed to relax the gastrocnemius. Stabilize the tibia with one hand and pull the heel forward with the other.
*   **Positive Sign:** Excessive anterior translation of the talus compared to the normal side, sometimes with a "clunk."
*   **Diagnosis:** Rupture/laxity of the [[Anterior Talofibular Ligament]] (ATFL).

**2. Talar Tilt Test**
*   **Method:** Stabilize the tibia. Grasp the heel and force it into inversion.
*   **Positive Sign:** Excessive tilting of the talus.
*   **Diagnosis:** Rupture of the [[Calcaneofibular ligament]] (CFL).

#### B. Tests for Achilles Tendon
**1. Thompson’s Test (Simmonds' Test)**
*   **Method:** Patient lies prone with feet hanging off the edge of the bed. The examiner squeezes the calf muscles.
*   **Normal Response:** Passive plantarflexion of the foot.
*   **Positive Sign:** Absence of plantarflexion.
*   **Diagnosis:** Complete rupture of the [[Achilles tendon]].

> **Mnemonic for Thompson Test:** **T**hompson **T**est **T**argets **T**endon (**T**endo-Achilles).

**2. Matles Test**
*   **Method:** Patient prone, flexes knees to 90°.
*   **Positive Sign:** The foot on the injured side falls into neutral or slight dorsiflexion (loss of normal plantarflexion tension).
*   **Diagnosis:** Achilles tendon rupture.

#### C. Tests for Syndesmosis (High Ankle Sprain)
**1. Squeeze Test**
*   **Method:** Compress the tibia and fibula together at the mid-calf level.
*   **Positive Sign:** Pain felt distally at the ankle joint (syndesmosis).
*   **Diagnosis:** [[Tibiofibular syndesmosis]] injury.

**2. External Rotation Stress Test**
*   **Method:** Stabilize the leg and externally rotate the foot.
*   **Positive Sign:** Pain over the anterior tibiofibular ligament/syndesmosis.
*   **Diagnosis:** Syndesmosis injury.

#### D. Tests for Nerve Entrapment
**1. Tinel’s Sign (Ankle)**
*   **Method:** Tap over the [[Posterior tibial nerve]] behind the medial malleolus (tarsal tunnel).
*   **Positive Sign:** Tingling or paresthesia radiating into the foot.
*   **Diagnosis:** [[Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome]].

**2. Mulder’s Click (Squeeze Test for Neuroma)**
*   **Method:** Squeeze the metatarsal heads together with one hand while pressing the interdigital space with the other thumb.
*   **Positive Sign:** A palpable click and reproduction of pain.
*   **Diagnosis:** [[Morton's neuroma]] (Interdigital neuroma).

#### E. Tests for Flat Foot (Pes Planus)
**1. Jack’s Test (Hubscher Maneuver)**
*   **Method:** With the patient standing, dorsiflex the great toe.
*   **Positive Sign:** The medial longitudinal arch rises, and the tibia rotates externally.
*   **Diagnosis:** Indicates a **flexible** flat foot. If the arch does not restore, it is a rigid flat foot.

**2. Single Heel Raise Test**
*   **Method:** Ask the patient to stand on one leg and lift the heel off the ground.
*   **Positive Sign:** Inability to perform the heel raise or the heel fails to invert.
*   **Diagnosis:** [[Tibialis posterior]] tendon dysfunction.
