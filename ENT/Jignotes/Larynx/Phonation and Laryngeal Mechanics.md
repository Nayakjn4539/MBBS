# Phonation and Laryngeal Mechanics

The primary functions of the larynx, phylogenetically, are the protection of the lower airways and respiration. However, in humans, it has evolved into a sophisticated organ for [[phonation]] (voice production),.

### Mechanism of Phonation
The currently accepted theory of voice production is the **Aerodynamic Myoelastic Theory**,,. The larynx functions like a wind instrument.

**The Phonation Cycle:**
1.  **Adduction:** The [[true vocal cords]] are brought to the midline (adducted) by the adductor muscles. They are not tightly closed but approximated.
2.  **Subglottic Pressure Build-up:** Exhaled air from the lungs (powered by thoracic and abdominal muscles) builds up pressure below the adducted vocal cords,.
3.  **Opening/Separation:** When the subglottic pressure exceeds the muscular resistance of the vocal cords, the cords are forced apart, releasing a small puff of air,.
4.  **Bernoulli Effect & Elastic Recoil:**
    *   **Bernoulli Effect:** As air passes through the narrow glottic chink at high velocity, the pressure drops (negative pressure), creating a suction force that pulls the cords back together.
    *   **Myoelastic Recoil:** The inherent elasticity of the vocal folds helps them snap back to the midline.
5.  **Vibration:** This cycle of opening and closing repeats rapidly (100–120 Hz in males, 200+ Hz in females), causing the vocal cords to vibrate and modify the air column into sound waves,.

### Phases of Speech Production
Speech is a complex process involving three distinct phases,:

1.  **Pulmonary Phase (The Generator/Bellows):**
    *   The lungs provide the energy flow (airflow) and subglottic pressure required to drive the vocal cords.
    *   Disorders here (e.g., COPD, weak respiratory muscles) result in a weak voice.

2.  **Laryngeal Phase (The Vibrator):**
    *   The [[vocal folds]] vibrate to convert airflow into audible sound (phonation).
    *   This sound is a "raw" buzzing tone.

3.  **Supraglottic/Oral Phase (The Resonator & Articulator):**
    *   **Resonance:** The raw sound is amplified and modified by the [[pharynx]], [[oral cavity]], [[nasal cavity]], and chest. This gives the voice its unique "timbre" or quality,.
    *   **Articulation:** The sound is shaped into intelligible speech (words) by the articulators: [[lips]], [[tongue]], [[soft palate]], [[teeth]], and [[hard palate]].

### Laryngeal Biomechanics (Muscles and Movements)

The movement of the vocal cords relies on the intrinsic laryngeal muscles acting upon the laryngeal joints.

**Laryngeal Joints**,,:
*   **[[Cricoarytenoid joint]]:** A saddle joint permitting rotatory (abduction/adduction) and gliding movements.
*   **[[Cricothyroid joint]]:** A synovial joint allowing the thyroid cartilage to tilt forward/downward, increasing the distance between the thyroid and arytenoids, thereby tensing the vocal cords.

**Intrinsic Muscles of Larynx**,,:

| Functional Group | Muscle Name | Action | Nerve Supply |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Abductor** | [[Posterior Cricoarytenoid]] (PCA) | Opens the glottis (Safety muscle of larynx) | [[Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve]] (RLN) |
| **Adductors** | [[Lateral Cricoarytenoid]] (LCA) | Adducts vocal cords (membranous part) | RLN |
| | [[Interarytenoid]] (Transverse & Oblique) | Closes posterior commissure | RLN (Bilateral supply) |
| | [[Thyroarytenoid]] (External) | Adducts vocal cords | RLN |
| **Tensors** | [[Cricothyroid]] | Lengthens and tenses cords (increases pitch) | [[External Laryngeal Nerve]] (SLN) |
| | [[Vocalis]] (Internal Thyroarytenoid) | Tenses the cord body, relaxes the cover (fine-tuning) | RLN |
| **Relaxers** | [[Thyroarytenoid]] | Shortens and relaxes cords (decreases pitch) | RLN |
| **Inlet Control** | [[Aryepiglottic muscle]] | Closes laryngeal inlet | RLN |
| | [[Thyroepiglottic muscle]] | Opens laryngeal inlet | RLN |

*Mnemonic:* **PCA** = **P**ulls **C**ords **A**part (Abductor).

### Determinants of Voice Characteristics

**1. Pitch (Frequency)**,,:
*   Determined by the frequency of vocal cord vibration.
*   Dependent on the **Length**, **Tension**, and **Mass** of the vocal folds.
*   **Mechanism:** Contraction of the [[Cricothyroid muscle]] lengthens and tightens the cords $\rightarrow$ Increases frequency $\rightarrow$ Higher pitch.
*   **Gender difference:** Males have longer and heavier vocal cords (due to testosterone), resulting in lower pitch (100–120 Hz) compared to females (180–220 Hz).

**2. Loudness (Intensity)**,:
*   Determined by the amplitude of vibration.
*   Directly proportional to the subglottic air pressure generated by the lungs. Increased airflow $\rightarrow$ greater displacement of cords $\rightarrow$ louder voice.

**3. Quality (Timbre)**,:
*   Determined by the number of harmonics and the natural resonance of the supraglottic vocal tract (pharynx, mouth, nose).

### Structural Basis of Vibration (Body-Cover Theory)

The vocal fold is not a uniform block of tissue but consists of layers with different mechanical properties,.

**Histological Layers**,:
1.  **Epithelium:** Stratified squamous non-keratinized.
2.  **[[Lamina Propria]] (3 Layers):**
    *   *Superficial Layer (SLLP):* Also known as **[[Reinke's Space]]**. Loose, pliable, gelatinous. Allows the mucosal wave to travel.
    *   *Intermediate Layer (ILLP):* Elastic fibers.
    *   *Deep Layer (DLLP):* Collagen fibers. (ILLP + DLLP = [[Vocal Ligament]]).
3.  **Vocalis Muscle:** The main body.

**Body-Cover Theory**:
*   **Cover:** Epithelium + Reinke's Space (Compliant, vibrates freely).
*   **Transition:** Vocal Ligament.
*   **Body:** Vocalis Muscle (Stiff, provides stability).
*   Phonation relies on the loose "cover" sliding and vibrating over the stiffer "body."

### Clinical Implications

*   **[[Reinke's Edema]]:** Accumulation of fluid in the superficial lamina propria (Reinke's space), usually due to smoking. Causes a low-pitched, husky voice because the mass of the cord increases,.
*   **[[Vocal Nodules]]:** Occur at the junction of the anterior 1/3 and posterior 2/3 of the vocal cords (point of maximum vibration/amplitude). They prevent proper glottic closure and disrupt the mucosal wave, causing hoarseness,.
*   **[[Puberphonia]]:** Failure of the voice to drop to a lower pitch during puberty in males despite normal laryngeal growth. Often psychogenic or due to muscle imbalance. Treated by **Gutzmann’s pressure test** (pressing thyroid cartilage back and down to relax cords) or **Type III Thyroplasty**,.
*   **[[Vocal Cord Paralysis]]:**
    *   **RLN Palsy:** Cords lie in median/paramedian position because the adductor (Cricothyroid) is still functioning (Wagner and Grossman theory),.
    *   **Combined (RLN + SLN) Palsy:** Cords lie in "cadaveric" (intermediate) position because all muscles including the tensor (Cricothyroid) are paralyzed,.
*   **Laryngectomy Rehabilitation:**
    *   Since the laryngeal vibrator is removed, a new source of vibration is needed.
    *   **[[Esophageal Speech]]:** Air is swallowed and ejected; the pharyngoesophageal segment vibrates.
    *   **[[Tracheoesophageal Puncture]] (TEP):** A prosthesis (e.g., Blom-Singer) shunts pulmonary air into the esophagus to produce vibration.
