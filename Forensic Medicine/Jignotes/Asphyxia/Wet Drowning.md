# [[Asphyxia]] > Wet Drowning

### Definition
[[Wet Drowning]], also known as typical or primary drowning, is the form of [[asphyxia]] caused by the **aspiration of fluid** into the lungs. This implies that a liquid-air interface is present at the entrance of the victim's airway, preventing the breathing of oxygen. It occurs when the reflex laryngospasm (seen in dry drowning) relaxes due to cerebral hypoxia, allowing water to flood the respiratory tree.

### Classification and Pathophysiology
The mechanism of death depends heavily on the tonicity of the fluid inhaled (Fresh water vs. Sea water). In both types, the primary problem is **surfactant destruction** leading to alveolar collapse and [[Ventilation-Perfusion Mismatch]].

#### 1. Fresh Water Drowning
*   **Mechanism:** Fresh water is **hypotonic** to blood.
*   **Pathology:**
    *   Water is rapidly absorbed from the [[alveoli]] into the pulmonary circulation.
    *   **Haemodilution:** Blood volume increases (hypervolemia) by up to 50% within a few minutes.
    *   **Haemolysis:** Red blood cells swell and rupture, releasing potassium.
    *   **Electrolyte Imbalance:** Leads to **Hyponatremia** (low sodium), **Hypocalcemia**, and **Hyperkalemia** (high potassium).
*   **Cause of Death:** The massive release of potassium and hypoxia leads to **[[Ventricular Fibrillation]]**.

#### 2. Sea Water (Salt Water) Drowning
*   **Mechanism:** Sea water is **hypertonic** to blood.
*   **Pathology:**
    *   The high salt concentration draws fluid *from* the circulation *into* the alveoli (osmosis).
    *   **Haemoconcentration:** Blood volume decreases (hypovolemia).
    *   **Electrolyte Imbalance:** **Hypernatremia** (high sodium) and **Hypermagnesemia**.
    *   **Pulmonary Edema:** Massive fluid accumulation in the lungs.
*   **Cause of Death:** **Asphyxia** due to pulmonary edema, shock, and eventual cardiac standstill (asystole).

#### Comparison Table: Fresh Water vs. Salt Water Drowning

| Feature | Fresh Water Drowning | Salt Water (Sea Water) Drowning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tonicity** | Hypotonic | Hypertonic |
| **Fluid Movement** | Alveoli $\rightarrow$ Blood (Circulation) | Blood $\rightarrow$ Alveoli (Lungs) |
| **Blood Volume** | Increases (**Hypervolemia**) | Decreases (**Hypovolemia**) |
| **Hemoglobin** | Hemolysis (Ghost RBCs) | Crenated RBCs (Hemoconcentration) |
| **Electrolytes** | Hyperkalemia, Hyponatremia | Hypernatremia, Hypermagnesemia |
| **Heart Rhythm** | **Ventricular Fibrillation** | Asystole / Cardiac Standstill |
| **Lungs (Autopsy)** | Light, ballooned, retain shape, crepitus present | Heavy, boggy, sodden, jelly-like, no crepitus |

### Autopsy Findings in Wet Drowning

**A. External Findings**
1.  **Froth:** Presence of **fine, white, lathery froth** at the mouth and nostrils. This is the most characteristic sign. It is produced by the churning of water, air, and mucus during violent respiratory efforts (vital reaction).
2.  **[[Cutis Anserina]] (Gooseflesh):** Due to spasm of erector pilae muscles caused by cold water.
3.  **[[Washerwoman's Hands]]:** Bleached, sodden, and wrinkled skin on palms and soles. Appears in 12–24 hours.
4.  **[[Cadaveric Spasm]]:** Firm grasping of weeds, mud, or grass in the hands. This is a sure sign that the victim was **alive** when entering the water.
5.  **Hypostasis:** Usually found on the face, upper chest, and extremities (head-down position due to gravity while floating). Can be pinkish due to oxygenated moist air or dissolution of oxygen in cold water.

**B. Internal Findings**
1.  **Lungs ([[Emphysema Aquosum]]):**
    *   **Ballooning:** Lungs are voluminous, cover the pericardium, and bulge out of the chest cavity upon opening.
    *   **Rib Markings:** Indentations of ribs are seen on the lung surface due to over-distension.
    *   **Weight:** Increased (especially in salt water).
    *   **Cut Section:** Exudes copious frothy fluid (edema) and blood.
2.  **[[Paltauf's Haemorrhages]]:** Large, pale bluish-red subpleural hemorrhages (ecchymoses) usually seen on the lower lobes. Caused by the rupture of alveolar partitions due to increased pressure.
3.  **Respiratory Tract:** Trachea and bronchi filled with froth, sand, silt, or aquatic weeds.
4.  **Stomach:** Presence of water, mud, or vegetation in the stomach is common (swallowed during struggle).
5.  **Middle Ear:** Hemorrhage in the middle ear and mastoid air cells is a frequent finding (though not specific).

### Diagnostic Tests

1.  **[[Diatom Test]]:**
    *   Diatoms are microscopic unicellular algae with silica shells.
    *   If a person inhales water while alive, diatoms penetrate alveolar walls, enter the circulation, and lodge in distant organs like the **bone marrow** (femur/sternum), brain, and kidneys.
    *   Finding diatoms in the bone marrow is strong evidence of **antemortem drowning**.
    *   *Technique:* Acid digestion of tissues to destroy organic matter, leaving silica shells for microscopic view.

2.  **Biochemical Tests (Gettler's Test):**
    *   Analysis of chloride content in blood from the left and right sides of the heart.
    *   *Fresh water:* Left heart chloride < Right heart.
    *   *Salt water:* Left heart chloride > Right heart.
    *   *Note:* This test is largely obsolete due to unreliability if decomposition has started.

### Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Manner of Death:**
    *   **Accidental:** Most common (swimming, falling into wells/rivers, children in bathtubs).
    *   **Suicidal:** Common. Bodies are often found floating. Sometimes victims tie weights to themselves.
    *   **Homicidal:** Rare, except in infants or incapacitated adults.
*   **Disposal:** Homicide victims may be killed by other means and thrown into water to simulate drowning. Absence of froth, water in lungs, and diatoms in marrow helps distinguish this (Postmortem Immersion).
*   **Shallow Water Drowning:** Unconscious persons (e.g., epileptics, drunks) can drown in very shallow water (puddles, drains) if the face is submerged.

### Mnemonic
To remember the pathophysiology of **Fresh** vs. **Salt** water:

**FRESH** water goes **F**lat (Hemolysis) and causes **F**ibrillation.
**SALT** water makes the lungs **S**odden, **S**tuffed (Pulmonary edema), and the heart **S**tops (Asystole).
