# Radiational Injuries of the Eye

Ocular tissues absorb radiant energy of specific wavelengths, leading to various pathological changes. The extent of damage depends on the type of radiation, duration of exposure, and the absorption characteristics of the tissue.

### Spectrum of Ocular Absorption

The eye acts as a filter, absorbing specific wavelengths at different levels:
*   **Cornea**: Absorbs UV rays shorter than 295 nm [[UV-C]] and [[UV-B]].
*   **Lens**: Absorbs UV rays between 295 nm and 350-400 nm [[UV-A]].
*   **Retina**: Visible light (400–700 nm) and short infrared rays reach the retina.

### 1. Ultraviolet (UV) Radiation Injuries

Ultraviolet radiation primarily affects the superficial structures of the eye (Cornea and Conjunctiva) but can contribute to lenticular changes over time.

#### A. Photophthalmia (Snow Blindness / Welder's Flash)
An acute condition caused by the absorption of UV rays (specifically **UV-B**: 290–311 nm) by the [[corneal epithelium]].

*   **Etiology**:
    *   Exposure to naked arc light (Industrial welding, cinema operators).
    *   Short circuit flashes.
    *   Reflection from snow surfaces (**Snow Blindness**) due to high UV reflection at high altitudes.
    *   UV lamps.
*   **Pathogenesis**:
    *   **Latent Period**: Symptoms do not appear immediately; there is a latent period of **4–5 hours**.
    *   **Mechanism**: Desquamation of epithelial cells leading to multiple epithelial erosions.
*   **Clinical Features**:
    *   **Symptoms**: Severe burning pain, extreme [[photophobia]], [[lacrimation]], and [[blepharospasm]].
    *   **Signs**: Lid swelling, conjunctival hyperaemia, and multiple fluorescein-positive punctate epithelial erosions on the [[cornea]].
*   **Management**:
    *   **Prophylaxis**: Use of protective goggles (e.g., **Crookes glass** which absorbs UV and IR rays).
    *   **Treatment**:
        *   Cold compresses.
        *   Topical antibiotics and cycloplegics.
        *   **Double eye patching** for 24 hours (facilitates epithelial regeneration).
        *   Oral analgesics/sedatives.

#### B. Chronic Effects of UV Radiation
*   **Conjunctiva**: Associated with [[Pterygium]] and [[Pinguecula]].
*   **Cornea**: [[Climatic Droplet Keratopathy]] (Spheroidal degeneration).
*   **Lens**: Epidemiology links UV exposure to [[Senile Cataract]] (Cortical type).

### 2. Infrared (Thermal) Radiation Injuries

Infrared rays possess heating effects. They are absorbed largely by the pigment of the [[iris]] and [[ciliary body]], affecting the lens indirectly via heat transfer.

#### A. Heat Cataract (Glassblower's Cataract)
Occurs in industry workers exposed to intense heat and IR rays (e.g., Glassblowing, Iron and Steel industries, Chainmakers) over many years.

*   **Pathogenesis**: Heat acts on the iris pigment $\rightarrow$ indirect thermal damage to lens epithelium/fibers.
*   **Characteristic Signs**:
    1.  **True Exfoliation**: The zonular lamella of the [[anterior capsule]] peels off in large sheets which may curl up in the pupillary area.
    2.  **Posterior Subcapsular Cataract**: Typically discoid in shape.
*   **Mnemonics**: **"Heat Peels the Skin"** (True Exfoliation occurs in Heat Cataract).

#### B. Solar Retinopathy (Eclipse Blindness)
Also known as **Photoretinitis**. While historically linked to thermal injury, modern understanding attributes this largely to **photochemical damage** caused by short-wavelength visible light (**Blue light**) with some contribution from UV-A.

*   **Etiology**:
    *   Direct sun gazing (Solar eclipse viewing).
    *   Sunbathing.
    *   Occupational (Welding arcs).
*   **Clinical Features**:
    *   **Symptoms**: Persistence of negative after-image (sun spot) progressing to a positive central [[scotoma]]. Metamorphopsia and decreased central vision (6/12 – 6/60).
    *   **Signs**:
        *   *Early*: Small yellow spot with grey margins at the [[foveola]].
        *   *Late*: "Burnt-out" hole in the [[retinal pigment epithelium]] surrounded by mottled pigmentation (Bean/Kidney shaped).
*   **Prognosis**: Guarded. Visual acuity may improve over months but a small scotoma often persists.
*   **Treatment**: Systemic steroids (controversial/limited benefit). Prevention is key.

### 3. Ionizing Radiation Injuries

Caused by X-rays, Gamma rays, or neutrons (e.g., during Radiotherapy for head and neck cancers, or occupational exposure).

#### A. Radiation Cataract
*   **Latent Period**: 6 months to a few years.
*   **Morphology**: Typically **Posterior Subcapsular Cataract** (similar to heat cataract) but can mature to total opacification.
*   **Sensitivity**: The [[lens]] is the most radiosensitive structure in the eye.

#### B. Other Ionizing Radiation Effects
*   **Lids**: Radiation dermatitis, [[madarosis]] (loss of lashes), poliosis.
*   **Conjunctiva/Cornea**: Radiation keratoconjunctivitis, dry eye (damage to lacrimal gland), keratinization.
*   **Retina**: **Radiation Retinopathy**.
    *   Microangiopathy appearing months/years after therapy.
    *   Resembles [[Diabetic Retinopathy]] (Microaneurysms, hemorrhages, exudates, cotton wool spots, neovascularization).
*   **Optic Nerve**: Radiation [[Optic Neuropathy]] (delayed, irreversible visual loss).

---

### 4. Electrical Injuries

Passage of strong electric current (Lightning or High-voltage shock) through the body.

*   **Electric Cataract**:
    *   **Onset**: 2–4 months after shock.
    *   **Morphology**: **Punctate subcapsular opacities** (snowflake-like) or anterior capsular changes. matures rapidly.
*   **Other Effects**:
    *   Conjunctival congestion.
    *   Corneal opacities (interstitial).
    *   [[Iridocyclitis]].
    *   Retinal hemorrhages.
    *   Optic Neuritis.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Prevention**: Use of **Crookes Glass** is essential for industrial workers. It contains Cerium oxide (blocks UV) and Iron oxide (blocks IR).
*   **History Taking**: In cases of unilateral posterior subcapsular cataract in a young patient, always ask about history of radiotherapy or electric shock.
*   **Macular Exam**: In young patients with unexplained central scotoma, inquire about sun-gazing or eclipse viewing.
