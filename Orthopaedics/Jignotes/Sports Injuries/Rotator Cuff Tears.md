### Rotator Cuff Tears: Tests and Management

[[Rotator cuff]] pathology is a spectrum of disease ranging from tendonitis and impingement to partial and complete tears. It is a common cause of shoulder pain and disability, particularly in athletes involved in overhead activities and the elderly population.

### Relevant Anatomy
The stability and motion of the [[glenohumeral joint]] rely heavily on the dynamic stabilization provided by the rotator cuff muscles.

**Mnemonic: SITS**
*   **S** - [[Supraspinatus]] (Initiates abduction 0-15°) - *Most commonly injured tendon.*
*   **I** - [[Infraspinatus]] (External rotation)
*   **T** - [[Teres Minor]] (External rotation)
*   **S** - [[Subscapularis]] (Internal rotation) - *Often called the "forgotten tendon".*

These tendons fuse with the joint capsule to form a musculotendinous cuff around the humeral head.

### Etiology and Pathogenesis
The etiology is often multifactorial, generally divided into intrinsic and extrinsic factors.

1.  **Trauma:** Common in young individuals (e.g., fall on an outstretched hand or jerking motion).
2.  **Degeneration:** Common in the elderly (>40 years). With age, vascularity decreases (especially in the "critical zone" of the supraspinatus), making tendons susceptible to tears with minor stress.
3.  **Impingement:** [[Impingement syndrome]] occurs when the rotator cuff tendons (primarily supraspinatus) are compressed between the [[humeral head]] and the [[coracoacromial arch]] during abduction.

**Neer's Stages of Impingement:**
*   **Stage I:** Edema and hemorrhage (Reversible).
*   **Stage II:** Fibrosis and tendinitis (Irreversible changes).
*   **Stage III:** Bone spurs and tendon rupture (Tears).

### Clinical Features
*   **Pain:** Usually over the lateral aspect of the shoulder (deltoid region). Worse with overhead activity and at night (can disturb sleep).
*   **Weakness:** Inability to perform specific movements (abduction, rotation) depending on the tendon involved.
*   **Stiffness:** Secondary [[adhesive capsulitis]] (Frozen shoulder) may develop due to pain.
*   **Atrophy:** In chronic cases, wasting of the supraspinatus or infraspinatus fossae muscles may be visible.

### Special Tests for Diagnosis
Physical examination is crucial for localizing the specific tendon involved.

#### 1. Tests for Impingement
These tests provoke pain by compressing the inflamed tendon.

| Test Name | Procedure | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Neer's Impingement Test]]** | The examiner stabilizes the scapula and forcibly elevates the patient's arm in forward flexion. | Pain indicates impingement of the supraspinatus against the acromion. |
| **[[Hawkins-Kennedy Test]]** | The arm is flexed to 90° and forcibly internally rotated. | Compresses the supraspinatus tendon against the coracoacromial ligament. |
| **[[Painful Arc Test]]** | The patient actively abducts the arm. | Pain between **60° and 120°** suggests subacromial impingement. Pain >120° suggests [[acromioclavicular joint]] pathology. |

#### 2. Tests for Supraspinatus Integrity
*   **[[Jobe’s Test]] (Empty Can Test):**
    *   **Procedure:** The patient abducts the arm to 90° in the scapular plane and internally rotates it (thumb pointing down, as if emptying a can). The examiner applies downward pressure.
    *   **Positive Sign:** Weakness or pain indicates a supraspinatus tear or tendinitis.
*   **Drop Arm Test:**
    *   **Procedure:** The examiner passively abducts the arm to 90°. The patient is asked to lower it slowly.
    *   **Positive Sign:** The arm drops suddenly or the patient cannot control the descent, indicating a massive tear.

#### 3. Tests for Subscapularis Integrity
*   **[[Lift-off Test]] (Gerber’s Test):**
    *   **Procedure:** Patient places the dorsum of the hand against the mid-lumbar spine. They are asked to lift the hand away from the back against resistance.
    *   **Positive Sign:** Inability to lift the hand indicates a subscapularis tear.
*   **[[Belly Press Test]] (Napoleon Sign):**
    *   **Procedure:** Patient presses the palm against the abdomen with the wrist straight.
    *   **Positive Sign:** If the elbow drops back (wrist flexion occurs) to maintain pressure, it indicates weakness.
*   **[[Bear Hug Test]]:**
    *   **Procedure:** Patient places the palm of the affected side on the opposite shoulder with the elbow anterior to the body. Examiner tries to pull the hand off the shoulder.
    *   **Positive Sign:** Weakness compared to the opposite side.

### Classification of Tears
Tears can be classified based on size (American Arthroscopic Orthopedics classification):
*   **Small tear:** < 1 cm
*   **Medium tear:** 1–3 cm
*   **Large tear:** 3–5 cm
*   **Massive tear:** > 5 cm

### Investigations
1.  **X-rays:** Usually normal in early stages.
    *   May show **[[cystic changes]]** in the greater tuberosity.
    *   **Acromial spurs** or sclerosis.
    *   **High-riding humeral head:** Indicates a massive chronic tear.
2.  **[[MRI]] (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):**
    *   **Investigation of Choice (IOC)** for diagnosis.
    *   Provides details on the size of the tear, retraction, and muscle atrophy/fatty degeneration.
    *   Best viewed in coronal oblique and sagittal oblique planes.
3.  **Ultrasound:**
    *   Cost-effective and dynamic but operator-dependent. Good for screening full-thickness tears.
4.  **Arthroscopy:**
    *   **Gold Standard** for diagnosis and simultaneous treatment.

### Management principles
Treatment depends on the patient's age, activity level, size of the tear, and duration of symptoms.

#### 1. Conservative Management
Indicated for elderly patients, low-demand patients, and partial-thickness tears.
*   **Rest:** Avoidance of overhead activities and provocative movements.
*   **Medication:** **[[NSAIDs]]** (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) to reduce pain and inflammation.
*   **Physiotherapy:**
    *   Strengthening of the remaining rotator cuff muscles (especially depressors of the humeral head) and [[scapular stabilizers]].
    *   Capsular stretching to prevent stiffness.
*   **Steroid Injections:** Subacromial injection of corticosteroids may provide temporary relief to facilitate physiotherapy. *Caution: Repeated injections can weaken the tendon.*

#### 2. Operative Management
Indicated for young active patients, full-thickness acute traumatic tears, or failure of conservative management after 3-6 months.

*   **Arthroscopic Repair:**
    *   The standard of care. Minimally invasive.
    *   Involves **[[subacromial decompression]]** (acromioplasty) to remove bone spurs.
    *   Reattachment of the torn tendon to the footprint on the humerus using **[[suture anchors]]**.
*   **Open/Mini-open Repair:** Less common now, used for very large or complex tears.
*   **Tendon Transfers:** For massive, irreparable tears (e.g., Pectoralis major transfer for subscapularis, Latissimus dorsi for supraspinatus/infraspinatus).
*   **Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty:** For elderly patients with massive irreparable tears and [[cuff tear arthropathy]].

**Clinical Implication:**
Post-operative rehabilitation is critical. Passive motion is started early to prevent stiffness, but active motion is delayed (usually 4-6 weeks) to allow tendon-to-bone healing.
