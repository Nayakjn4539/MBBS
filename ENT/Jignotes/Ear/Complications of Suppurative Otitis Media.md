# Complications of Suppurative Otitis Media

Complications of [[suppurative otitis media]] (SOM) arise when the infection spreads beyond the mucoperiosteal lining of the middle ear cleft. While the incidence has declined due to antibiotics, these complications remain significant, particularly in developing countries due to poor socioeconomic status and lack of healthcare access.

### Pathways of Spread of Infection
Infection can spread from the middle ear to surrounding structures via three main mechanisms:
1.  **Direct Bone Erosion:**
    *   **Acute infection:** Hyperemic decalcification of bone.
    *   **Chronic infection:** Osteitis or erosion by [[cholesteatoma]] and granulation tissue.
2.  **Venous Thrombophlebitis:**
    *   Retrograde spread via small venules connecting the middle ear to intracranial venous sinuses or brain tissue. This can occur even with intact bone.
3.  **Preformed Pathways:**
    *   **Congenital:** Dehiscence of the [[facial nerve]] canal or floor of the middle ear (jugular bulb), patent petrosquamosal suture.
    *   **Traumatic/Iatrogenic:** Skull fractures, surgical defects (stapedectomy, mastoidectomy).
    *   **Anatomical:** [[Oval window]] and [[round window]].

### Classification of Complications
Complications are broadly classified into Intratemporal (within the temporal bone) and Intracranial (within the cranial cavity).

### A. Intratemporal Complications

#### 1. Acute Mastoiditis
It is the inflammation of the mucosal lining of the antrum and mastoid air cell system causing destruction of bony walls (coalescence).
*   **Pathology:** Production of pus under tension $\rightarrow$ Hyperemic decalcification $\rightarrow$ Coalescence of air cells $\rightarrow$ Empyema of mastoid.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Pain:** Persistent or recurrent pain behind the ear.
    *   **Discharge:** Profuse, purulent, and often pulsatile (**Light House Sign**).
    *   **Sagging of Posterosuperior Meatal Wall:** Due to periostitis of the bony wall between the antrum and external auditory canal.
    *   **Reservoir Sign:** [[External auditory meatus]] refills with pus immediately after suctioning.
    *   **Ironed-out appearance:** Obliteration of the postauricular sulcus due to periosteal edema.
*   **Complications of Mastoiditis (Abscesses):**
    *   **Postauricular Abscess:** Most common; pinna displaced forwards, outwards, and downwards.
    *   **Zygomatic Abscess:** Swelling anterior and superior to the pinna; edema of upper eyelid.
    *   **Bezold's Abscess:** Pus breaks through the mastoid tip into the sternocleidomastoid muscle (swelling in the neck).
    *   **Citelli’s Abscess:** Pus tracks along the posterior belly of the digastric muscle to the occipital region.
    *   **Luc’s Abscess:** Subperiosteal abscess in the deep meandering part of the external auditory canal.

#### 2. Petrositis (Petrous Apicitis)
Infection extends into a pneumatized [[petrous apex]].
*   **Clinical Features (Gradenigo’s Syndrome Triad):**
    1.  **Otorrhea:** Persistent ear discharge.
    2.  **Retro-orbital pain:** Due to irritation of the [[trigeminal nerve]] (Vth nerve) ganglion.
    3.  **Diplopia:** Due to [[abducens nerve]] (VIth nerve) palsy affecting the lateral rectus muscle.
*   **Diagnosis:** CT Temporal bone; MRI to differentiate marrow from pus.

#### 3. Facial Nerve Paralysis
Can occur in both acute and chronic otitis media.
*   **In Acute Otitis Media (AOM):** Due to congenital dehiscence of the fallopian canal. It is usually an ischemic neuropraxia due to edema.
    *   *Treatment:* Systemic antibiotics + [[Myringotomy]] (conservative management).
*   **In Chronic Otitis Media (CSOM):** Due to bone erosion by [[cholesteatoma]] or granulation tissue.
    *   *Treatment:* Urgent surgical exploration (Mastoidectomy) and decompression.

#### 4. Labyrinthitis
Spread of infection to the inner ear.
*   **Circumscribed Labyrinthitis (Fistula):** Erosion of the bony capsule (usually lateral semicircular canal).
    *   *Sign:* Positive **Fistula Test** (nystagmus and vertigo induced by pressure on the tragus).
*   **Diffuse Serous Labyrinthitis:** Pre-suppurative stage; reversible.
    *   *Symptoms:* Vertigo, nausea, spontaneous nystagmus towards the *affected* ear.
*   **Diffuse Suppurative Labyrinthitis:** Permanent loss of function.
    *   *Symptoms:* Severe vertigo, total sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), nystagmus towards the *healthy* ear.

**Clinical Implication:** A "Dead Labyrinth" will give a false-negative fistula test.

### B. Intracranial Complications

#### 1. Meningitis
The most common intracranial complication.
*   **Etiology:** *H. influenzae* and *Strep. pneumoniae*.
*   **Clinical Features:** High fever, headache, neck rigidity, photophobia, positive **Kernig’s** and **Brudzinski’s signs**.
*   **Diagnosis:** Lumbar puncture (turbid CSF, low sugar, high protein, increased cells).

#### 2. Otogenic Brain Abscess
Usually located in the **Temporal Lobe** (most common) or **Cerebellum**.
*   **Pathology Stages:** Invasion (encephalitis) $\rightarrow$ Localization (capsule) $\rightarrow$ Enlargement $\rightarrow$ Termination (rupture).
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   *Raised ICT:* Headache (worse in morning), projectile vomiting, papilledema, bradycardia.
    *   *Temporal Lobe Abscess:* Nominal aphasia (in dominant hemisphere), homonymous superior quadrantanopia (field defect), uncinate fits (hallucination of smell/taste).
    *   *Cerebellar Abscess:* Ataxia, intention tremor, dysdiadochokinesia, nystagmus.
*   **Treatment:** Neurosurgical drainage (aspiration/excision) followed by mastoidectomy.

#### 3. Lateral Sinus Thrombophlebitis (Sigmoid Sinus Thrombosis)
Inflammation and thrombus formation in the [[sigmoid sinus]].
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Hectic Picket-Fence Fever:** Spiking fever with chills and rigors due to septic emboli.
    *   **Griesinger’s Sign:** Edema and tenderness over the mastoid due to thrombosis of the mastoid emissary vein.
    *   **Tobey-Ayer Test:** Compression of the jugular vein on the healthy side raises CSF pressure (normal), but compression on the thrombosed side causes no rise.
    *   **Crowe-Beck Sign:** Pressure on healthy jugular vein engorges retinal veins.
*   **Diagnosis:** Contrast CT/MRI shows **Delta Sign** (Empty triangle sign).

#### 4. Extradural and Subdural Abscess
*   **Extradural Abscess:** Collection of pus between bone and dura. Often asymptomatic (silent) but may cause persistent headache and pulsatile discharge.
*   **Subdural Abscess:** Pus between dura and arachnoid. Signs of meningeal irritation and rapid neurological deterioration.

#### 5. Otitic Hydrocephalus
Raised intracranial pressure with normal CSF findings (benign intracranial hypertension) associated with middle ear infection.
*   **Mechanism:** Impaired CSF absorption due to lateral sinus thrombosis extending to the superior sagittal sinus.
*   **Symptoms:** Severe headache, diplopia (VI nerve palsy), blurring of vision (papilledema).
