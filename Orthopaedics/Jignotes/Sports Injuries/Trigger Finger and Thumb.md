# Trigger Finger and Thumb (Stenosing Tenosynovitis)

### Definition and Pathophysiology
**Trigger finger** (or thumb) is a condition characterized by the inhibition of smooth tendon gliding due to mechanical impingement at the annular pulley system. It is clinically termed **[[Stenosing tenosynovitis]]**.

*   **Mechanism:**
    *   The [[flexor tendon]] becomes thickened or develops a nodule.
    *   Simultaneously, the entrance of the fibrous tendon sheath (specifically the **[[A1 pulley]]**) becomes stenosed or thickened.
    *   When the finger flexes, the thickened tendon/nodule passes through the pulley.
    *   Upon extension, the nodule gets trapped proximal to the pulley, causing the finger to become stuck in flexion.
    *   With forceful muscular effort or passive assistance, the nodule passes the constriction with a sudden, audible, and palpable "snap" or "click," resembling the release of a pistol trigger.

### Etiology and Risk Factors
The condition is often idiopathic but is frequently associated with overuse or underlying systemic conditions.

*   **Trauma/Overuse:**
    *   Repetitive gripping or trauma to the palm.
    *   Common in occupations requiring manual labor or repetitive hand use.
*   **Demographics:**
    *   More common in **Females**.
    *   Typical age group: **40–60 years**.
*   **Associated Medical Conditions:**
    *   **[[Diabetes mellitus]]** (Strong association; often multiple digits involved).
    *   **[[Rheumatoid arthritis]]** (Due to bulky tenosynovitis).
    *   **[[Hypothyroidism]]**.
    *   **[[Amyloidosis]]**.
    *   **[[Gout]]**.

### Clinical Anatomy
*   **Most Common Digit:** **[[Ring finger]]**, followed by the thumb and middle finger.
*   **Most Common Tendon Involved:** **[[Flexor Digitorum Profundus]] (FDP)**.
*   **Site of Pathology:** The level of tendon sheath constriction is invariably at the **[[Metacarpophalangeal joint]] (MCP joint)**, specifically at the **[[A1 pulley]]**.

### Clinical Features
Patients typically present with a history of catching or locking of the digit.

**Symptoms:**
*   **Pain:** Localized at the base of the affected finger or thumb (distal palm).
*   **Locking:** The finger locks in flexion, especially in the morning.
*   **Snapping:** A painful click is felt when the finger is straightened.

**Signs:**
*   **Tenderness:** Palpable tenderness over the [[A1 pulley]] at the **[[distal palmar crease]]**.
*   **Palpable Nodule:** A tender nodule may be felt moving with the tendon at the base of the finger.
*   **Demonstrable Locking:** The patient may demonstrate the finger getting stuck; in severe cases, the patient must use the other hand to passively straighten the locked finger.

**Clinical Implication:**
> Although the locking sensation and motion deficit are often perceived at the [[Proximal Interphalangeal Joint]] (PIP), the pathology lies proximally at the MCP joint level (A1 Pulley).

### Diagnosis
Diagnosis is primarily clinical.
*   **History:** Classic description of locking/snapping.
*   **Physical Exam:** Palpation of the nodule and reproduction of triggering.
*   **Imaging:** X-rays are usually normal but may be ordered to rule out bony pathology or calcification in conditions like Gout. Ultrasound can confirm thickening of the pulley or tendon.

### Treatment
Treatment follows a stepped approach from conservative to surgical management.

| Modality | Description | Indications |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conservative** | • **Rest** and activity modification.<br>• **NSAIDs** for pain/inflammation.<br>• **Splinting** the finger in extension (night splinting). | Early stages, mild symptoms. |
| **Injection Therapy** | • Local infiltration of **[[Hydrocortisone]]** (Corticosteroid) into the tendon sheath (not the tendon itself).<br>• Often curative in non-diabetic patients. | First-line invasive treatment if conservative measures fail. |
| **Surgical Release** | • **Open Release:** Surgical slitting/excision of the **[[A1 pulley]]** to allow free tendon gliding.<br>• **Percutaneous Release:** Release using a needle or specially designed knife without an open incision. | Refractory cases, locked fingers, or failure of steroid injections. |

**Important Considerations:**
*   In **[[Rheumatoid arthritis]]**, surgical release is approached with caution due to the risk of tendon rupture or worsening ulnar drift; synovectomy is often required.
*   Diabetic patients may have a lower response rate to steroid injections and often require surgery.
