# Sprengel's Deformity

### Definition
Sprengel's deformity is a congenital anomaly characterized by an **undescended** and **hypoplastic** [[scapula]]. It is the most common congenital anomaly of the [[shoulder girdle]].

### Etiopathogenesis
During embryonic development, the [[scapula]] normally differentiates opposite the cervical vertebrae (C4–C5) and descends to the thoracic level (T2–T7) by the third month of gestation.
*   **Mechanism:** Failure of this normal caudal migration (descent) results in the scapula remaining high in the neck.
*   **Genetic Factors:** Most cases are sporadic, though some may have an autosomal dominant inheritance.

### Pathoanatomy
The anatomical alterations involve the bone, muscles, and connections to the spine.

*   **The Scapula:**
    *   **Position:** Located higher than the normal side.
    *   **Shape:** It is **hypoplastic** (smaller) and distorted.
    *   **Rotation:** It is usually rotated such that the **inferior angle points medially** (towards the spine).
    *   The supraspinous portion of the scapula is often hooked anteriorly.
*   **The Omovertebral Bar:**
    *   A pathological connection often exists between the superior angle of the scapula and the cervical spine (spinous process, lamina, or transverse process of C4–C7).
    *   This connection may be fibrous, cartilaginous, or bony ([[omovertebral bone]]).
    *   This bar rigidly anchors the scapula, limiting movement.
*   **Muscles:** Periscapular muscles (trapezius, rhomboids, levator scapulae) may be hypoplastic, fibrotic, or partially absent.

### Clinical Features
The condition is usually noted at birth or in early childhood due to asymmetry or limited movement.

1.  **Inspection (Look):**
    *   **Asymmetry:** The affected shoulder is higher than the normal side.
    *   **Webbing:** The neck appears short and webbed on the affected side.
    *   **Lump:** A palpable bony mass may be felt in the web of the neck (the superomedial angle of the scapula).
    *   **Scoliosis:** Associated congenital [[scoliosis]] may be evident.

2.  **Movements (Move):**
    *   **Restricted Abduction:** Shoulder abduction is significantly limited because the scapula cannot rotate upwards due to the omovertebral tether.
    *   Scapulothoracic movement is absent or severely restricted.

### Associated Anomalies
Sprengel's deformity is frequently associated with other congenital malformations, particularly "K-R-S" (Kidney, Ribs, Spine).

| System | Associated Conditions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Spine** | [[Klippel-Feil syndrome]] (most common association), [[Congenital scoliosis]], Hemivertebrae, [[Spina bifida]] |
| **Ribs** | Cervical ribs, fused ribs, absent ribs |
| **Renal** | Renal agenesis or anomalies (requires ultrasound screening) |
| **Others** | [[Congenital torticollis]] |

### Classification
**Cavendish Classification** is commonly used to grade the severity of the deformity:
*   **Grade 1 (Very Mild):** Shoulders are level; deformity is invisible when dressed.
*   **Grade 2 (Mild):** Shoulders are almost level; a lump is visible in the neck.
*   **Grade 3 (Moderate):** Shoulder is elevated by 2–5 cm; easily visible deformity.
*   **Grade 4 (Severe):** Shoulder is elevated >5 cm; the superior angle is near the occiput with neck webbing.

### Investigations
*   **X-rays (AP and Lateral):**
    *   Shows the elevated, small, and rotated scapula.
    *   May reveal the [[omovertebral bone]] (best seen on lateral or oblique views).
    *   Evaluates associated spinal anomalies (hemivertebrae, scoliosis).
*   **CT Scan:** Best for defining the 3D anatomy of the omovertebral bar and planning surgery.
*   **Renal Ultrasound:** To rule out associated kidney anomalies.

### Treatment
Treatment depends on the severity of the deformity and the functional limitation.

#### 1. Conservative Management
*   **Indications:** Mild deformities (Cavendish Grade 1) with minimal functional limitation.
*   **Method:** Physiotherapy to maintain range of motion and prevent contractures.

#### 2. Surgical Management
*   **Indications:**
    *   Severe cosmetic deformity (Grade 3 and 4).
    *   Significant limitation of shoulder abduction.
*   **Timing:** Best performed between **3 to 8 years** of age. (Surgery in older children carries a higher risk of brachial plexus injury due to stretching).
*   **Procedures:**
    *   **[[Woodward's procedure]]:** The most common technique. Involves detaching the origins of the trapezius and rhomboids from the spinous processes, excising the omovertebral bar, displacing the scapula caudally (downwards), and reattaching the muscles at a lower level.
    *   **Green's Procedure:** Involves detachment of muscles from their *insertion* on the scapula, lowering the scapula, and reattachment.
    *   **Mears Procedure:** Release of the scapula with partial resection.

**Complications of Surgery:**
*   **Brachial Plexus Injury:** Caused by excessive traction when pulling the scapula down (most dangerous complication).
*   Keloid formation (unsightly scar).
*   Winged scapula.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Examination Tip:** Always examine the cervical spine and check for [[Klippel-Feil syndrome]] (short neck, low hairline, limited neck motion) in any child presenting with a high scapula.
*   **Functional Impact:** The primary functional loss is the inability to fully abduct the arm overhead, which can affect activities of daily living and sports.
