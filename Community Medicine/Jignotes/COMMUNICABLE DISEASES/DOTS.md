# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > DOTS

### **DOTS: Directly Observed Treatment, Short-Course**

[[DOTS]] is the internationally recommended strategy for TB control and the core component of the [[National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP)]] (formerly RNTCP) in India. It is a systematic strategy to ensure cure by providing the most effective medicine and confirming that it is taken.

**Definition:**
DOTS is a strategy to ensure cure by providing the most effective medicine and confirming that it is taken. It ensures that the patient takes the **right drugs**, in the **right doses**, at the **right intervals**.

### **1. The Five Key Components (Pillars) of DOTS**

The success of DOTS depends on five distinct elements,,:

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Political and Administrative Commitment** | Sustained commitment at all levels to ensure provision of organized and comprehensive TB control services. |
| **2. Good Diagnosis** | Reliance on quality-assured [[Sputum Smear Microscopy]] (or molecular tests like [[CBNAAT]]) rather than just X-rays to detect infectious cases. |
| **3. Good Drugs (Supply)** | Uninterrupted supply of quality-assured anti-TB drugs. |
| **4. Directly Observed Treatment** | A trained provider watches the patient swallow the medication. |
| **5. Systematic Monitoring** | Standardized recording and reporting system to assess the outcome of each patient (Accountability). |

### **2. Modus Operandi of DOTS Administration**

Under the NTEP, treatment is given in two phases: **Intensive Phase (IP)** and **Continuation Phase (CP)**.

**A. The DOTS Provider**
*   **Who can be a provider?** Health workers (MPWs), Anganwadi workers, teachers, social workers, dais, or ex-patients.
*   **Who CANNOT be a provider?** The patient's **family members** are generally excluded to ensure strict objective compliance.
*   **Location:** The [[DOT Centre]] should be convenient to the patient and the provider.

**B. Drug Administration Schedule**

*   **Intensive Phase (IP):**
    *   All doses are taken under **direct observation** of the DOT provider.
    *   If a dose is missed, the patient is contacted within 24 hours (1 day).
*   **Continuation Phase (CP):**
    *   Patient is issued medicine for one week in a **multiblister combipack**.
    *   **At least the first dose** of the week is swallowed in the presence of the health worker/provider,.
    *   The patient consumes the remaining doses at home self-administered.
    *   **Compliance Check:** The empty blister pack must be returned to the provider when collecting the next week's supply,.
    *   If a dose is missed, the patient is retrieved within a week.

### **3. Logistics: Patient-Wise Boxes (PWB)**

Drugs are supplied in boxes containing the full course of treatment for an individual patient to ensure no stock-outs occur mid-treatment,.

*   **Color Coding of Boxes (Historical/Traditional Categories):**
    *   **Red:** [[Category I]] (New Cases).
    *   **Blue:** [[Category II]] (Previously Treated Cases).
*   **Fixed Dose Combinations (FDCs):** Under newer guidelines, drugs are provided as daily FDCs (e.g., HRZE in one pill) according to **weight bands** to reduce pill burden and improve compliance,.

### **4. Technical Updates & Innovations**

*   **Shift to Daily Regimen:** The program has transitioned from the intermittent (thrice-weekly) regimen to a **daily regimen** for all TB patients.
*   **[[99 DOTS]]:** An IT-enabled adherence support system. Medication blister packs are wrapped in a custom envelope with hidden phone numbers. When a patient dispenses a dose, the number becomes visible; they call this toll-free number to register adherence,.
*   **Nikshay:** A case-based web-based application for surveillance and monitoring of all TB patients.

### **5. Advantages of DOTS**

1.  **Ensures Cure:** High cure rate (at least 85%),.
2.  **Prevents Resistance:** Prevents the emergence of [[MDR-TB]] (Multi-Drug Resistant TB) by ensuring regularity.
3.  **Cost-Effective:** DOTS is 2.7 times cheaper for the health system and highly cost-effective compared to conventional non-supervised therapy.
4.  **Community Based:** Treatment is available close to the patient's home.

---

### **6. Clinical Relevance: Why Observation?**

*   **The "Human Element":** Patients often stop taking drugs once symptoms subside (usually after 2-3 weeks).
*   **Consequence:** Incomplete treatment leads to relapse and the development of resistant strains (MDR/XDR-TB).
*   **Solution:** DOTS shifts the responsibility of cure from the patient to the **health system/provider**.
