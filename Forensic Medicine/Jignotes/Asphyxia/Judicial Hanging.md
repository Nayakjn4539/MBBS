# [[Asphyxia]] > Judicial Hanging

### **JUDICIAL HANGING**

**Judicial Hanging** is a form of [[asphyxia]] (though death is rarely due to asphyxia) used as a method of legal execution (Capital Punishment) where the convict is suspended by the neck using a ligature. Unlike suicidal hanging, this involves a calculated "long drop" to ensure rapid death.

#### **Principles and Mechanism**
*   **Principle:** The body is dropped from a height (usually 5–7 meters) based on the convict's weight and build. The constricting force is the sudden arrest of the drop by the noose, utilizing the **vis viva** (living force/kinetic energy) of the falling body.
*   **Position of the Knot:**
    *   **Ideally:** The knot is placed **sub-mental** (below the chin). This position facilitates forcible [[hyperextension]] of the head.
    *   **Indian Context:** In practice, the knot is often placed below the ear (sub-aural) or at the angle of the mandible.
*   **Mechanism of Death:**
    *   The primary mechanism is **not** asphyxia or venous congestion.
    *   The sudden drop causes forceful **distraction and hyperextension** of the neck.
    *   This results in the fracture-dislocation of the upper cervical vertebrae, leading to crushing or transection of the [[spinal cord]] or brainstem.
    *   This causes instantaneous and irreversible loss of consciousness (due to reticular formation destruction) and irreversible [[apnoea]] (respiratory center destruction).

#### **The "Hangman's Fracture"**
This is the hallmark lesion of judicial hanging.

*   **Definition:** It is the traumatic [[spondylolisthesis]] of the **Axis (C2) vertebra**.
*   **Anatomy of Injury:**
    *   Bilateral fracture of the **pedicles or laminae** (pars interarticularis) of the C2 vertebra.
    *   Anterior dislocation (subluxation) of the C2 vertebra over the C3 vertebra.
    *   Associated tearing of the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments.
*   **Cause:** Forcible **hyperextension** of the head.

**Mnemonic for Mechanism:**
> **H**angman's **H**its **H**yperextension of **H**ead.

#### **Autopsy Findings**

**1. External Findings**
*   **Neck Elongation:** The neck appears stretched and considerably elongated due to the separation of vertebrae.
*   **Head Position:** The head is usually tilted to the side **opposite** to the knot.
*   **Ligature Mark:** A deep, transverse or oblique groove high up on the neck.
*   **Face:** Usually **pale**. Classical signs of asphyxia (congestion, petechiae, cyanosis) are **absent** because arterial supply and venous return are cut off instantly, or death occurs from nervous shock before congestion develops.
*   **Vital Signs:** There may be evidence of involuntary discharge of urine, feces, or seminal fluid.

**2. Internal Findings**
*   **Cervical Spine:**
    *   **Fracture-dislocation** of C2/C3 or C3/C4 (Hangman's fracture).
    *   Injury to the [[atlanto-occipital joint]] or odontoid process may occur.
    *   Laceration or crushing of the spinal cord at the upper cervical level.
*   **Soft Tissues:**
    *   Rupture of the pharyngeal tissues and strap muscles of the neck.
    *   **Amussat’s Sign:** Transverse tears in the intima of the carotid arteries due to stretching.
    *   The carotid or vertebral arteries may be completely torn across.
*   **Brain:** Rupture of the brainstem at the pontomedullary junction may be seen.

#### **Differences: Judicial vs. Typical Suicidal Hanging**

| Feature | Judicial Hanging | Suicidal Hanging (Typical) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Drop** | Long drop (several meters) | Short drop or suspension without drop |
| **Mechanism** | Fracture-dislocation of cervical spine (Brainstem injury) | Asphyxia and/or Venous Congestion |
| **Vertebral Fracture** | **Present** (C2-C3/Hangman's #) | **Absent** (Very rare) |
| **Ligature Mark** | Very deep and distinct | Variable depth (parchment-like) |
| **Face** | Pale | Usually congested/cyanosed |
| **Neck Length** | Elongated | Normal |
| **Consciousness** | Lost instantaneously | Lost in seconds (but not instant) |

#### **Medicolegal Aspects**
*   **Mode of Death:** Legal Execution (Homicide by the State, legally justified).
*   **Instantaneous Death:** While consciousness and respiration stop immediately due to brainstem injury, the **heart may continue to beat** for 10 to 20 minutes post-drop. This should not be confused with signs of life.
*   **Complications:** If the drop is too long, it may result in **decapitation**. If the drop is too short, the fracture may not occur, and the convict dies a slow, painful death by [[strangulation]].
