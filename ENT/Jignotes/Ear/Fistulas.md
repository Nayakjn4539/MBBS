### **Fistulas in Otorhinolaryngology**

A fistula is an abnormal communication between two epithelialized surfaces. In the context of the head and neck, these can be congenital or acquired (traumatic, infective, or iatrogenic).

---

### **1. Oro-Antral Fistula (OAF)**

An abnormal communication between the [[maxillary sinus]] (antrum) and the [[oral cavity]].

**Etiology**
*   **Dental Extraction (Most Common):** Especially of the **upper second premolar or first molar**, as their roots are closely related to the floor of the maxillary sinus.
*   **Infection:** Apical dental abscess, osteomyelitis of the maxilla.
*   **Trauma:** Maxillofacial injuries, penetrating wounds.
*   **Neoplasm:** Malignant tumors of the maxilla eroding the floor.
*   **Iatrogenic:** Complication of [[Caldwell-Luc operation]] (sublabial incision failure).

**Clinical Features**
*   **Regurgitation:** Liquids entering the nose while drinking.
*   **Discharge:** Foul-smelling, purulent discharge (due to secondary [[maxillary sinusitis]]).
*   **Voice Change:** Hyponasality or inability to blow cheeks/play wind instruments (air escapes into the nose).
*   **Pain:** Over the cheek due to sinusitis.
*   **Examination:** A probe can be passed from the oral opening into the antrum.

**Treatment**
| Condition | Management |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Recent/Small Fistula** | **Conservative:** Antibiotics, suturing gum margins, avoid nose blowing. |
| **Chronic/Large Fistula** | **Surgical Repair:** <br>1. **Buccal flap** or **Palatal flap** advancement.<br>2. **Caldwell-Luc operation:** Often required to remove diseased mucosa/foreign body/tooth root and create a nasoantral window for drainage. |
| **Malignancy** | **Dental Obturator:** Used to close the defect and allow observation of the cavity. |

**Clinical Implication:**
If an [[oroantral fistula]] is present, the patient cannot generate negative pressure in the mouth (difficulty drinking through a straw) or positive pressure (difficulty blowing balloons).

### **2. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Rhinorrhea (CSF Fistula)**

A fistula between the subarachnoid space and the nasal cavity/paranasal sinuses.

**Classification & Etiology**
1.  **Traumatic (Most Common):**
    *   **Accidental:** Head injuries, [[temporal bone fracture]].
    *   **Iatrogenic:** [[Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery]] (FESS), hypophysectomy, skull base surgery.
2.  **Non-Traumatic:**
    *   **Tumors:** Locally destructive tumors.
    *   **Congenital:** [[Encephalocele]].
    *   **Idiopathic:** Benign intracranial hypertension.

**Common Sites of Leak**
*   **Cribriform Plate:** Most common site (via olfactory nerve fibers).
*   **Frontal Sinus:** Posterior table fracture.
*   **Sphenoid Sinus:** Middle cranial fossa fractures.
*   **Temporal Bone:** Otorhinorrhea (CSF enters middle ear $\rightarrow$ [[Eustachian tube]] $\rightarrow$ nose).

**Diagnosis**
*   **Biochemical:** **Beta-2 Transferrin** assay (highly specific for CSF).
*   **Bedside Tests:**
    *   **Reservoir Sign:** Flow of fluid upon bending forward.
    *   **Target/Halo Sign:** If mixed with blood, CSF forms a clear halo around the central blood spot on filter paper.
    *   **Handkerchief Test:** Nasal secretions stiffen a handkerchief (mucus); CSF does not.
*   **Imaging:**
    *   **HRCT (High-Resolution CT):** To identify bony defects.
    *   **CT Cisternography/Intrathecal Fluorescein:** To localize the exact site of the active leak.

**Treatment**
*   **Conservative:** Bed rest (head elevated 30°), stool softeners (avoid straining), Acetazolamide (decreases CSF production).
*   **Surgical:** Endoscopic repair using grafts (fascia, fat, muscle, or mucosal flaps) and fibrin glue.

### **3. Labyrinthine and Perilymph Fistula**

**A. Labyrinthine Fistula (Circumscribed Labyrinthitis)**
*   **Definition:** Erosion of the bony capsule of the labyrinth, exposing the membranous labyrinth.
*   **Site:** Most commonly the **Horizontal (Lateral) Semicircular Canal**.
*   **Cause:** Erosion by [[cholesteatoma]] (Chronic Otitis Media - Squamous type).
*   **Symptoms:** Transient vertigo induced by pressure changes (e.g., cleaning the ear, tragal pressure).
*   **Diagnosis:** **Positive [[Fistula Test]]** (nystagmus and vertigo induced by pneumatic otoscopy).
*   **Treatment:** Mastoidectomy (Matrix of cholesteatoma over the fistula is carefully managed).

**B. Perilymph Fistula**
*   **Definition:** Abnormal communication between the [[inner ear]] fluids (perilymph) and the [[middle ear]].
*   **Sites:** [[Oval window]] or [[Round window]].
*   **Causes:**
    *   **Trauma:** Barotrauma (diving/flying), head injury, acoustic trauma.
    *   **Iatrogenic:** Complication of [[stapedectomy]].
    *   **Congenital:** Hyrtl's fissure (tympanomeningeal hiatus).
*   **Clinical Features:** Fluctuating SNHL and vertigo.
*   **Hennebert’s Sign:** Positive fistula test *without* a bony fistula (seen in syphilis or adhesions).

### **4. Congenital Fistulas of the Neck and Face**

| Type | Pathogenesis | Clinical Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Preauricular Sinus/Fistula** | Imperfect fusion of auricular hillocks (1st and 2nd arch). | Pit usually near the root of the helix/tragus. May get infected. Lined by squamous epithelium. |
| **Collaural Fistula** | 1st Branchial Cleft anomaly. | Track connects the neck (angle of mandible) to the [[external auditory canal]]. Passes through the [[parotid gland]] near the facial nerve. |
| **Branchial Fistula** | 2nd Branchial Cleft anomaly (most common). | External opening at the anterior border of the [[sternocleidomastoid muscle]]. Tract runs between internal and external carotid arteries. |
| **Thyroglossal Fistula** | Rupture/Infection of a [[thyroglossal cyst]]. | Midline neck opening. Tract moves up with swallowing and tongue protrusion. |

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a diagram of the neck showing locations of preauricular (ear), branchial (lateral neck), and thyroglossal (midline) fistulas.

### **5. Tracheoesophageal Fistula (TEF)**

**Congenital TEF**
*   Results from failure of separation of the laryngotracheal groove from the esophagus.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Type III:** (Most common - 82%) Upper esophagus ends blindly (atresia), lower segment connects to trachea.
    *   **Type IV (H-type):** No atresia; fistula connects intact trachea and esophagus. Presents with recurrent aspiration/pneumonia.

**Acquired TEF**
*   **Causes:** Malignancy (carcinoma esophagus/trachea), Trauma, Prolonged cuff pressure from [[tracheostomy]] or endotracheal tube.
*   **Diagnosis:** Contrast swallow, Bronchoscopy.

---

### **6. Other Specific Fistulas**

*   **Frontocutaneous Fistula:** Complication of acute [[frontal sinusitis]] or osteomyelitis ([[Pott's puffy tumor]]). Pus discharges through a fistula in the upper eyelid or forehead.
*   **Tracheocutaneous Fistula:** A persistent opening between the trachea and skin following decannulation of a long-standing tracheostomy.

---

### **Mnemonics**

*   **CSF Rhinorrhea Features:** **"Sugar is Sweet, Halo is Neat"**
    *   **Sugar:** Glucose >30mg/dL (though unreliable).
    *   **Halo:** Blood-tinged CSF creates a halo on filter paper.
*   **Branchial Cleft Cyst/Fistula Locations:**
    *   **1st:** Ear (Collaural).
    *   **2nd:** Tonsillar fossa (goes to neck).
    *   **3rd:** Pyriform sinus.
