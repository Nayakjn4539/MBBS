# [[Asphyxia]] > Secondary Drowning

### Secondary Drowning (Post-Immersion Syndrome)

**Secondary Drowning**, also known as **Near-Drowning with Delayed Death** or **Post-Immersion Syndrome**, refers to death occurring after a latent period (ranging from minutes to days) following resuscitation from a submersion incident. The victim initially survives the drowning episode but succumbs later due to complications.

#### Synonyms
*   Post-immersion syndrome
*   Near-drowning with subsequent death
*   Delayed drowning

#### Pathophysiology
The primary mechanism involves the aspiration of a small amount of water (fresh or salt) which triggers a cascade of inflammatory and chemical reactions:
1.  **Surfactant Destruction:** Aspired water washes out or denatures [[pulmonary surfactant]].
2.  **Alveolar Collapse:** Loss of surfactant leads to atelectasis (collapse of alveoli).
3.  **Membrane Injury:** Direct damage to the alveolar-capillary membrane increases permeability.
4.  **Non-Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema:** Fluid leaks into the alveoli, causing [[pulmonary edema]] and impaired gas exchange.
5.  **Hypoxia and Acidosis:** Severe ventilation-perfusion mismatch leads to systemic [[hypoxia]] and metabolic [[acidosis]].

#### Clinical Features
*   **Latent Period:** The patient may appear relatively asymptomatic immediately after rescue.
*   **Respiratory Distress:** Progressive dyspnea, tachypnea, and cough developing hours after the incident.
*   **Physical Signs:** Tachycardia, cyanosis, widespread crepitations (crackles) on auscultation, and frothy sputum.
*   **Neurological Status:** Confusion, agitation, or lethargy due to cerebral hypoxia.

#### Causes of Death (Complications)
The delayed fatality is attributed to:
1.  **Metabolic Acidosis:** Severe disruption of acid-base balance.
2.  **Electrolyte Imbalance:** Severe hyperkalemia or hyponatremia/hypernatremia depending on the medium (fresh vs. salt water).
3.  **Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE):** Permanent brain damage due to initial oxygen deprivation.
4.  **Respiratory Complications:**
    *   [[ARDS]] (Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome).
    *   Aspiration pneumonia (chemical pneumonitis or bacterial infection from contaminated water).
    *   Lung abscess or bronchiectasis (in prolonged survival).

#### Mnemonic for Complications
**"PEAS"**
*   **P**neumonia / Pulmonary Edema
*   **E**lectrolyte Imbalance
*   **A**cidosis (Metabolic)
*   **S**welling of Brain (Encephalopathy)

#### Autopsy Findings
Since death is delayed, the typical signs of wet drowning (froth, ballooned lungs) may be modified by medical intervention or the duration of survival.
*   **Lungs:** Heavy, edematous, and consolidated. May show signs of bronchopneumonia, abscess formation, or hyaline membrane formation (ARDS).
*   **Brain:** Cerebral edema, softening, and signs of hypoxic damage (infarction).
*   **Heart:** Subendocardial hemorrhages may be present due to hypoxia.
*   **Other Organs:** General congestion and signs of [[sepsis]] if infection supervened.

#### Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Observation:** Victims of near-drowning must be kept under medical observation for at least 24–48 hours, even if asymptomatic initially, to detect onset of pulmonary edema.
*   **Negligence:** Failure to admit and observe a near-drowning victim who subsequently dies at home may lead to claims of [[medical negligence]].
*   **Nature of Death:** Usually accidental, but homicide must be ruled out if the circumstances of the initial immersion are suspicious.
