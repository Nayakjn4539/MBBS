# [[MEDICINE & SOCIAL SCIENCE]] > Customs do not always have negative effect on health

### **Customs and Health: A Positive Perspective**

[[Culture]] is defined as learned behavior which has been socially acquired. It plays a profound role in human health and disease. While often associated with superstition or ignorance, **not all customs and beliefs are harmful**. Many traditional practices, based on centuries of trial and error, possess positive values that promote health and prevent disease.

### **Classification of Customs**

Customs regarding health are broadly classified into four categories based on their impact:

1.  **Good (Beneficial) Customs:** These should be encouraged and supported.
2.  **Bad (Harmful) Customs:** These require extensive health education to be eradicated (e.g., applying cow dung to the umbilical cord).
3.  **Unimportant Customs:** These have no significant health impact (e.g., piercing ears).
4.  **Uncertain Customs:** Their effect is not fully scientifically established (e.g., applying *kajal* to eyes, though some link it to infection).

### **Beneficial Customs Affecting Health**

The following are examples of customs that positively influence health status:

#### **1. Maternal and Child Health (MCH)**
*   **Prolonged Breastfeeding:** In many traditional Indian societies, [[breastfeeding]] is continued for a long duration. This provides essential nutrition, immunity (antibodies), and emotional bonding.
*   **Oil Bath and Massage:** The traditional practice of giving oil massages and baths to infants improves circulation and skin health.
*   **Sun Exposure:** The custom of exposing infants to morning sunlight helps in the synthesis of [[Vitamin D]] and prevents rickets.
*   **Rest During Puerperium:** The custom of women going to their parents' home for delivery ensures adequate rest and reduced household workload during the late pregnancy and postpartum period.

#### **2. Dietary Habits**
*   **Vegetarianism:** In many communities (e.g., Hindu society), vegetarianism is given a place of honor. A diet rich in fibers and low in animal fat reduces the risk of [[Non-communicable diseases]] like coronary heart disease and bowel cancer.
*   **Cereals and Pulses Combination:** The habit of consuming cereals mixed with pulses (e.g., *Dal-Chawal*) improves protein quality by ensuring the presence of all essential amino acids.
*   **Parboiling of Rice:** This traditional practice preserves water-soluble vitamins (B-complex) that are otherwise lost during the milling of raw rice.
*   **Traditional Fermented Foods:** Foods like curd (dahi) or idli are probiotics that aid digestion.

#### **3. Personal Hygiene**
*   **Ritual Bathing:** The Indian custom of daily bathing and ceremonial baths on special occasions promotes personal hygiene.
*   **Oral Hygiene:** The use of **Neem** twigs (Datun) for brushing teeth acts as a natural antiseptic and maintains oral hygiene.
*   **Washing Hands and Feet:** The custom of washing hands and feet before entering a house or eating reduces the transmission of infections.

#### **4. Social and Mental Health**
*   **Family Support System:** The [[Joint Family]] system acts as a social security net, providing care for the elderly, widows, and the sick, thereby acting as a shock absorber against mental stress.
*   **Yoga and Meditation:** Traditional practices like [[Yoga]] and meditation are scientifically proven to reduce stress, lower blood pressure, and improve mental well-being.

### **Clinical Relevance: The Physician's Role**

*   **Communication on a Cultural Plane:** A successful doctor must understand the local culture. Instead of mocking all traditions, the physician should identify beneficial customs and integrate them into medical advice.
*   **Resistance to Change:** If a doctor challenges deeply held beliefs openly (e.g., concepts of "Hot" and "Cold" foods), patients may lose confidence. It is better to phrase advice within their cultural framework (e.g., describing a medicine as "heating" to cure a "cold" disease).
*   **Health Education:** Education should aim to reinforce good habits while gradually replacing harmful ones with scientific practices.
