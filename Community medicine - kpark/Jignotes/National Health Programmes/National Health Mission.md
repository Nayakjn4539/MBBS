| **[[Maternal Mortality Ratio]] (MMR)** | Reduce to 1/1000 live births (100/100,000) |
| **[[Total Fertility Rate]] (TFR)** | Reduce to 2.1 |
| **[[Tuberculosis]]** | Reduce annual incidence and mortality by half |
| **[[Leprosy]]** | Reduce prevalence to <1/10,000 and incidence to zero in all districts |
| **[[Malaria]]** | Annual Malaria Incidence <1/1000 |
| **[[Kala-Azar]]** | Elimination (<1 case per 10,000 population) by 2015 |

### I. National Rural Health Mission ([[NRHM]])
Launched on **5th April 2005** (initially for 7 years, later extended), NRHM focuses on improving the rural healthcare delivery system.

**Focus States:** Special focus is given to **18 states** with weak public health indicators, including 8 Empowered Action Group (EAG) states (Bihar, Jharkhand, MP, Chhattisgarh, UP, Uttarakhand, Orissa, Rajasthan), 8 North-East states, Himachal Pradesh, and J&K.

#### Core Strategies of NRHM,,:
1.  ** Decentralized Planning:** Preparation of inter-sectoral District Health Plans.
2.  **[[ASHA]] (Accredited Social Health Activist):** Creation of a female community health activist in every village (1 per 1000 population) to act as an interface between the community and the public health system.
3.  **Strengthening Infrastructure:**
    *   **[[Sub-centre]]:** Strengthened with untied funds (Rs. 10,000/annum) and supply of essential drugs (allopathic and AYUSH).
    *   **[[Primary Health Centre]] (PHC):** Provision of 24-hour services in at least 50% PHCs; upgradation for 24-hour referral services.
    *   **[[Community Health Centre]] (CHC):** Upgradation to **First Referral Units (FRUs)** with 30-50 beds, operating 24 hours with specialist services (anesthetist, surgeon, etc.).
4.  **Community Participation:**
    *   **[[Rogi Kalyan Samiti]] (RKS):** (Patient Welfare Committee) A registered society to manage hospital affairs and utilize untied funds for patient welfare.
    *   **[[Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committee]] (VHSNC):** To empower local communities for health planning and sanitation.
5.  **Mainstreaming [[AYUSH]]:** Revitalizing local health traditions and integrating AYUSH into the health system.

### II. National Urban Health Mission ([[NUHM]])
Launched in **May 2013** as a sub-mission of NHM to address the health needs of the urban population.

**Coverage:**
*   All state capitals, district headquarters, and cities/towns with a population **>50,000**.
*   Focuses on the **urban poor**, slum dwellers (listed and unlisted), and vulnerable populations like rag-pickers, homeless, and migrants.

#### Institutional Mechanism under NUHM,,:

| Facility/Worker | Population Norm | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Urban Primary Health Centre]] (U-PHC)** | 1 for every **50,000** population | Located near slums; OPD (12 pm - 8 pm), basic lab, drug dispensing. No inpatient care. |
| **[[Urban Community Health Centre]] (U-CHC)** | 1 for every **2.5 to 5 Lakh** population | 30-50 bedded inpatient facility (100 beds in metros) for secondary care. |
| **[[ANM]]** | 1 for ~10,000 population | Provide outreach services, immunization, ANC at U-PHC. |
| **[[USHA]] (Urban Social Health Activist)** | 1 for **1000-2500** population | Community health volunteer (similar to ASHA) covering 200-500 households. |
| **[[Mahila Arogya Samiti]] (MAS)** | 1 for **50-100** households | Community-based group for local health planning and monitoring (250-500 population). |

### Key Initiatives under NHM

1.  **[[Janani Suraksha Yojana]] (JSY):** A conditional cash transfer scheme to promote **institutional delivery** among poor pregnant women to reduce MMR and neonatal mortality,.
2.  **[[Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram]] (JSSK):** Entitles all pregnant women and sick infants (up to 1 year) to **zero expense delivery/treatment** in public institutions, including free drugs, diet, diagnostics, and transport (home to facility, referral, and drop back).
3.  **[[Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram]] (RBSK):** Child health screening and early intervention services for **4 Ds**: **D**efects at birth, **D**iseases, **D**eficiencies, and **D**evelopmental delays (0-18 years).
4.  **[[Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram]] (RKSK):** Comprehensive adolescent health programme focusing on nutrition, sexual/reproductive health, mental health, injuries, substance misuse, and NCDs.
5.  **[[Ayushman Bharat]] Programme:**
    *   **Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs):** Upgrading 1.5 lakh Sub-centres and PHCs to provide Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC) including NCDs, mental health, and wellness activities like Yoga.
    *   **Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY):** Insurance cover up to **Rs. 5 Lakh** per family per year for secondary/tertiary care for poor families.
6.  **[[RMNCH+A]] Strategy:** Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child, and Adolescent Health. A continuum of care approach with "Plus" denoting the inclusion of Adolescence as a distinct stage.
7.  **[[Mother and Child Tracking System]] (MCTS):** Name-based web-enabled tracking of pregnant women and children to ensure service delivery.

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Referral Chain:** Doctors must understand the hierarchy (SC $\rightarrow$ PHC $\rightarrow$ CHC $\rightarrow$ District Hospital) to refer patients effectively.
*   **Free Services:** Clinicians in public sectors must be aware of JSSK entitlements (free drugs/diet/transport) to ensure patients do not pay out-of-pocket.
*   **Screening:** Implementation of opportunistic screening for NCDs (Diabetes/HTN) at the PHC/CHC level is crucial under NHM.

**Mnemonic for 4 Ds of RBSK:**
*   **D**efects (Birth)
*   **D**eficiencies
*   **D**iseases
*   **D**evelopment delays (including Disability)
