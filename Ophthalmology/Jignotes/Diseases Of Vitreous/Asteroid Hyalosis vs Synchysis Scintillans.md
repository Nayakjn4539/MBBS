# Diseases of Vitreous: Asteroid Hyalosis vs. Synchysis Scintillans

**[[Vitreous humour]]** opacities are frequent causes of visual complaints, specifically [[floaters]] or [[muscae volitantes]]. Two distinct degenerative conditions presenting as vitreous opacities are [[Asteroid Hyalosis]] and [[Synchysis Scintillans]]. While they may appear similar to the untrained eye, they have distinct etiological and clinical differences.

### Comparison Table: Asteroid Hyalosis vs. Synchysis Scintillans

| Feature | [[Asteroid Hyalosis]] (Benson's Disease) | [[Synchysis Scintillans]] (Cholesterolosis Bulbi) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Composition** | **Calcium-containing lipid complexes** (Calcium soaps) attached to collagen fibrils. | **[[Cholesterol crystals]]**. |
| **Appearance** | Small, white, spherical or disc-shaped bodies ("Starry night" appearance). | Small, white/gold, angular, flat crystalline bodies ("Golden Rain"). |
| **State of Vitreous** | Usually **Normal/Solid Gel** (Healthy vitreous). | **Liquefied** ([[Synchysis]]). |
| **Movement** | Moves *with* the vitreous structure and returns to the original position (Suspended). | Crystals sink to the bottom (gravity-dependent). When the eye moves, they stir up and shower down (**Shower of Golden Rain**). |
| **Etiology** | Degenerative change (Senile). Associated with **Old age**. | Degenerative change following **Trauma**, [[Vitreous hemorrhage]], or severe inflammation. |
| **Laterality** | Usually **Unilateral** (75% of cases). | Usually Unilateral (affects the damaged eye). |
| **Systemic Association**| Historically associated with **[[Diabetes Mellitus]]** and hypercholesterolemia (though association is debated). | None specific; associated with history of ocular pathology/trauma. |
| **Impact on Vision** | Usually Asymptomatic. Does not significantly affect visual acuity. | Usually Symptomatic (floaters) but vision loss is due to the underlying pathology, not the crystals. |

### Detailed Clinical Features

#### 1. [[Asteroid Hyalosis]]
*   **Definition:** A benign, degenerative condition characterized by the accumulation of calcium-lipid complexes suspended in the vitreous gel.
*   **Clinical Presentation:**
    *   Primarily affects **elderly patients**.
    *   Patients are usually **asymptomatic** despite the dramatic appearance on examination.
    *   **Fundoscopy:** The examiner sees numerous small, white/yellow spherical bodies. They reflect light and appear white against the red fundus reflex.
    *   **Dynamics:** Because the vitreous structure is usually intact (not liquefied), the opacities move with the eye movements but return to their original position when the eye stops moving.
*   **Management:**
    *   **No treatment** is generally required.
    *   [[Pars plana vitrectomy]] is rarely indicated, only if the opacities significantly interfere with the patient's vision or preclude adequate visualization of the fundus for treating other conditions (e.g., [[Diabetic Retinopathy]]).

#### 2. [[Synchysis Scintillans]] (Cholesterolosis Bulbi)
*   **Definition:** A degenerative condition where cholesterol crystals accumulate in the vitreous humor.
*   **Pathogenesis:**
    *   Occurs in **damaged eyes** that have suffered from:
        *   Ocular **Trauma**.
        *   Long-standing **[[Vitreous hemorrhage]]**.
        *   Chronic inflammation (Uveitis).
    *   The vitreous undergoes **liquefaction** ([[Synchysis]]), allowing the crystals to move freely.
*   **Clinical Presentation:**
    *   **Fundoscopy:** Showers of refractive, angular crystals that glint like gold.
    *   **Gravity Effect:** Due to the liquefied nature of the vitreous, the crystals settle at the bottom of the vitreous cavity when the eye is at rest.
    *   **Movement:** Upon eye movement, the crystals are stirred up and swirl around, creating a dazzling effect described as a **"Shower of Golden Rain"**, before slowly settling back down.
*   **Management:**
    *   The condition itself is untreatable and generally symptomless regarding pain.
    *   Management focuses on the underlying cause (e.g., old trauma, inflammation).

### Clinical Implications and Diagnosis

*   **Diagnostic Confusion:** While [[Asteroid Hyalosis]] is usually asymptomatic for the patient, it can make **ophthalmoscopy** (fundus examination) extremely difficult for the doctor due to light reflection.
*   **Ultrasonography ([[B-scan]]):**
    *   **Asteroid Hyalosis:** Shows medium-to-high amplitude point-like echoes within the vitreous gel. A distinct gap exists between the posterior vitreous cortex and the retina (if PVD is not present).
    *   **Synchysis Scintillans:** Shows highly reflective, mobile echoes that move freely in the liquefied vitreous and settle inferiorly.

### Mnemonic for Differentiation

*   **A**steroid = **A**ttached (suspended in gel), **A**symptomatic, **A**ge-related.
*   **S**ynchysis = **S**inks (gravity dependent), **S**hakes (on movement), **S**everely damaged eye.
