# [[Sexual Jurisprudence]] > Indecent Assault

### **Indecent Assault**

**Definition**
Indecent assault is an assault or use of criminal force against a woman with the intention to **outrage her modesty**, or with the knowledge that such an act is likely to outrage her modesty. It occupies a legal position midway between common assault and [[Rape]].

Unlike [[Rape]], **penetration** is **NOT** a requisite for indecent assault.

**Legal Provisions (Indian Penal Code & BNS)**

| Offence | IPC Section | BNS Section (New) | Punishment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Outraging Modesty** | **Sec. 354** | **Sec. 74** | Imprisonment min 1 year, up to 5 years + Fine |
| **Sexual Harassment** | **Sec. 354 A** | **Sec. 75** | Up to 3 years + Fine |
| **Intent to Disrobe** | **Sec. 354 B** | **Sec. 76** | Min 3 years, up to 7 years + Fine |
| **[[Voyeurism]]** | **Sec. 354 C** | **Sec. 77** | 1st conviction: 1-3 years; Subsequent: 3-7 years |
| **[[Stalking]]** | **Sec. 354 D** | **Sec. 78** | 1st conviction: up to 3 years; Subsequent: up to 5 years |
| **Insulting Modesty** (Word/Gesture) | **Sec. 509** | **Sec. 79** | Up to 3 years + Fine |

*Note: BNS refers to Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.*

**Acts Constituting Indecent Assault**
Any act that violates the sexual integrity or dignity of a woman without amounting to penetration falls under this category:
*   Kissing, hugging, or fondling breasts/genitalia without consent.
*   Forcible stripping or attempt to disrobe a woman.
*   **Frotteurism:** Rubbing one's genitalia against a non-consenting person (usually in crowds/public transport).
*   Making indecent gestures or using vulgar/obscene language (Section 509 IPC / 79 BNS).
*   Exposing one's private parts to a woman (Exhibitionism/Flashing).
*   Intruding upon the privacy of a woman.

**Medicolegal Examination of the Victim**

**1. Consent and History**
*   **Informed Written Consent** is mandatory. If the victim is <12 years, consent from a guardian is required.
*   **History:** Detailed account of the incident (time, place, nature of the act).
    *   Specific inquiries: Was there touching? Where? Was there ejaculation? Did she scratch the assailant?
    *   **Note:** The definition of "Modesty" is legally interpreted as a virtue that attaches to a female on account of her sex.

**2. General Physical Examination**
*   **Signs of Struggle:** Look for abrasions, bruises, or nail marks on:
    *   Wrists (restraint injuries).
    *   Arms and shoulders.
    *   Face, lips, and neck (attempts to kiss or silence).
    *   Breasts and inner thighs (attempts to fondle).
    *   Back/Buttocks (if pushed against a hard surface).
*   **Clothes:** Examine for torn buttons, mud stains, or disarray indicating struggle.

**3. Local Examination**
*   **Genitalia:** Usually **no injury** is found on the genitalia or hymen because penetration is absent.
*   **Stains:** Look for [[Seminal stains]] on clothes, thighs, or abdomen if the assailant ejaculated externally.
    *   Use **Wood's Lamp** (UV light) for screening stains.
*   **Swabs:** Collect swabs from areas allegedly kissed, licked, or bitten to detect Saliva (Amylase) and for [[DNA Profiling]].

**Examination of the Accused**

*   **Potency Test:** Not routinely required as the crime does not involve intercourse, but may be relevant if **frotteurism** is alleged (capacity to achieve erection).
*   **Injuries:** Look for defense wounds caused by the victim:
    *   Scratch marks on the face, hands, or neck.
    *   Bite marks.
*   **Trace Evidence:** Look for transfer of lipstick, makeup, or fibers from the victim's clothes on the accused's person.
*   **Examination of Penis:** Check for smegma or seminal stains/traces of vaginal secretions (rare in indecent assault unless intimate contact occurred).

**Mnemonic for Sections 354 A-D**
*(Easy way to remember the Sexual Harassment Amendments)*

**S - V - S - D** (Sexual Violence Stops Dignity)
*   **354 A:** **S**exual Harassment (Physical contact/demand for favors).
*   **354 B:** **V**estiture (Disrobing/Undressing).
*   **354 C:** **S**eeing (Voyeurism).
*   **354 D:** **D**ogging/Following (Stalking).

**Difference Between Rape and Indecent Assault**

| Feature | [[Rape]] (Sec 375 IPC) | Indecent Assault (Sec 354 IPC) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Act** | Penetration (Penile/Object/Digital) is mandatory. | Penetration is **ABSENT**. Use of criminal force/assault. |
| **Intent** | Sexual intercourse. | To outrage modesty. |
| **Genital Injury** | Often present (hymenal tears, vaginal bruising). | Usually absent. |
| **Medical Evidence** | Sperm/Semen in vagina often found. | Semen may be on clothes/skin (external), not internal. |
| **Severity** | Higher gravity. | Lesser gravity than rape. |

**Important Medicolegal Aspects**
*   **Age of the Victim:** Irrelevant for the definition of the offense but relevant for sentencing (POCSO Act applies if <18 years).
*   **Corroboration:** Medical evidence (injuries, stains) acts as corroborative evidence to the victim's statement.
*   **Reporting:** Doctors are duty-bound to inform the police (Section 39 CrPC) in such cases.
*   **Examination of Male Victims:** Historically, indecent assault laws in India were gender-specific (protecting women). However, offenses against males (especially children) are covered under the **[[POCSO Act]]** or unnatural offenses sections.
