# [[Thanatology]] > Organ Transplantation

### Definition
**Organ Transplantation** is the transfer of human cells, tissues or organs from a donor to a recipient with the aim of restoring function(s) in the body. In India, this practice is strictly regulated by the [[Transplantation of Human Organs Act (THOA)]], 1994 (Amended in 2011 and 2014).

Under this Act, a **[[Human Organ]]** is defined as any part of a human body consisting of a structured arrangement of tissues which, if wholly removed, cannot be replicated by the body.

### Classification of Transplants
Grafts are classified based on the genetic relationship between the donor and the recipient:

| Type of Graft | Description | Synonyms |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Autograft]]** | Tissue transplanted from one part of the body to another in the *same* individual (e.g., skin graft). | Autologous/Autotransplant |
| **[[Isograft]]** | Transplantation between genetically identical individuals (e.g., monozygotic twins). | Syngeneic graft |
| **[[Allograft]]** | Transplantation between individuals of the *same species* but different genotype (e.g., kidney from brother to sister). | Homograft/Allogeneic |
| **[[Xenograft]]** | Transplantation from one species to another (e.g., porcine heart valves to humans). | Heterograft |
| **Split Transplant** | A deceased-donor organ (usually liver) is divided between two recipients (e.g., adult and child). | - |

### Transplantation of Human Organs Act (THOA), 1994
This legislation is the backbone of transplant medicine in India.
**Objectives:**
1.  Regulation of removal, storage, and transplantation of human organs for therapeutic purposes.
2.  Prevention of commercial dealings in human organs (illegal trade).
3.  Acceptance of [[Brainstem Death]] as a criterion for death to facilitate cadaveric donation.

#### Authority for Removal of Organs
*   **Living Donor:** Must be >18 years. Can authorize removal of their own organ.
*   **Deceased Donor (Cadaveric):**
    *   If the donor authorized it in writing before death (presence of 2 witnesses, one being a near relative).
    *   If no prior authorization exists, the person in "lawful possession" of the body (Next of Kin/Near Relative) can grant authority.
    *   **Unclaimed Bodies:** In hospitals/prisons, authority can be given after **48 hours** if the body remains unclaimed.

**"Near Relative" defined under the Act:** Spouse, son, daughter, father, mother, brother, sister, grandparents, grandchildren, uncles, and aunts.

### Brainstem Death and Certification
For organ harvesting (specifically heart, lungs, liver), the donor is often maintained on a ventilator to keep organs oxygenated. This is termed a **[[Beating Heart Donor]]** or **Living Cadaver**.

**The Board of Medical Experts:**
Certification of brainstem death requires a board of **four** medical experts. The transplant surgeon *cannot* be part of this board to avoid conflict of interest.

**Mnemonic for Board Members: HINT**
*   **H** - **H**ospital In-charge (Medical Superintendent).
*   **I** - **I**ndependent Specialist (Nominated from a panel approved by Appropriate Authority).
*   **N** - **N**eurologist or Neurosurgeon.
*   **T** - **T**reating Doctor (Doctor treating the patient).

**Procedure:**
*   The board must certify death after performing confirmatory tests (like Apnea test and testing for absent brainstem reflexes).
*   The tests must be performed **twice**, with a minimum interval of **6 hours** between the two testings.

### Viability of Organs (Warm Anoxic Time)
The success of a transplant depends on the **Warm Anoxic Time**—the interval between the cessation of circulation/oxygenation and the cooling/preservation of the organ.

| Organ/Tissue | Time Limit for Removal after Circulation Stops |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Kidney]]** | 30–60 minutes (Immediate cooling required) |
| **[[Liver]]** | 15–30 minutes |
| **[[Heart]]/Lung** | Immediate (Minutes) |
| **[[Cornea]]** | Within 6 hours |
| **[[Skin]]** | Within 24 hours |
| **[[Bone]]** | Within 48 hours |
| **[[Blood Vessel]]**| Within 72 hours |

### Medico-legal Aspects
1.  **Donation in Medico-legal Cases (MLC):**
    *   If the donor is a victim of an accident or crime (MLC), police/investigating officer (IO) permission is mandatory.
    *   The [[Registered Medical Practitioner]] (RMP) must request the Station House Officer (SHO).
    *   Organ retrieval must **not jeopardize** the determination of the cause of death (e.g., if the cause of death is suspected poisoning or injury to the specific organ intended for donation).
    *   The autopsy surgeon may need to be present during retrieval to record findings for the post-mortem report.

2.  **Offences and Penalties:**
    *   **Removal without authority:** Imprisonment up to 10 years + Fine (up to Rs. 20 Lakhs).
    *   **Commercial dealings:** Imprisonment 2–7 years + Fine (Rs. 10,000 – 20,000).
    *   **Doctor's Liability:** Name erased from State Medical Register (2 years for first offense, permanent for subsequent).

3.  **Consent:**
    *   Informed consent is mandatory.
    *   In live unrelated donation, approval from the **Authorization Committee** is required to rule out commercial exchange.

### Preservation of Organs
*   Organs must be preserved using specific preservative solutions (e.g., UW solution, Custodiol) and kept at low temperatures (hypothermia) to reduce metabolic rate and prevent ischemic injury.
*   Proper documentation and labeling are essential to maintain the chain of custody, especially in medicolegal cases.
