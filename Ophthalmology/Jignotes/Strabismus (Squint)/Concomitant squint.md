### Concomitant Squint (Strabismus)

**Definition**
[[Concomitant squint]], also known as **Comitant Strabismus** or **Heterotropia**, is a misalignment of the visual axes where the **angle of deviation remains constant** in all directions of gaze.
*   There is **no limitation** of ocular movements.
*   The **primary deviation** (deviation of the squinting eye) is equal to the **secondary deviation** (deviation of the normal eye under cover).

**Etiology**
The exact cause is often multifactorial, involving a breakdown in the **binocular fusion reflex**. The obstacles to binocular vision can be classified as:

1.  **Sensory Obstacles:** Factors preventing clear image formation.
    *   Refractive errors (e.g., Hypermetropia causing Esotropia).
    *   Prolonged use of incorrect spectacles.
    *   [[Anisometropia]].
    *   Corneal opacities, [[Congenital Cataract]], or Macular diseases.
2.  **Motor Obstacles:**
    *   Congenital abnormalities of orbital shape/size.
    *   Abnormalities of [[Extraocular muscles]] (insertions, length).
    *   Abnormal [[AC/A ratio]] (Accommodative Convergence/Accommodation ratio).
3.  **Central Obstacles:**
    *   Deficient development of the fusion faculty.
    *   Psychic/Emotional stress.

### Classification

#### A. Convergent Squint ([[Esotropia]])
This is the most common type of squint in children.

**1. Infantile (Congenital) Esotropia**
*   **Onset:** Birth to 6 months of age.
*   **Deviation:** Large angle (>30 prism diopters), usually constant.
*   **Refraction:** Normal for age (not significantly hypermetropic).
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Cross-fixation:** The child uses the left eye to look right and the right eye to look left.
    *   **Associations:** [[Dissociated Vertical Deviation]] (DVD), Inferior Oblique Overaction (IOOA), and Latent Nystagmus.
*   **Management:** Surgery is the treatment of choice (usually bimedial rectus recession).

**2. Accommodative Esotropia**
Occurs due to overaction of convergence associated with the accommodation reflex.
*   **Refractive Type:** Due to uncorrected [[Hypermetropia]] (+4D to +7D). The patient exerts excessive accommodation to clear the vision, stimulating excessive convergence.
    *   **Clinical Feature:** Deviation is fully corrected by glasses.
*   **Non-Refractive Type (High AC/A Ratio):** Refractive error is normal for age, but the convergence response to accommodation is abnormally high.
    *   **Clinical Feature:** Little/no deviation for distance, but marked esotropia for **near**.
    *   **Treatment:** Bifocal spectacles or Miotics (e.g., Echothiophate).

**3. Non-Accommodative (Acquired) Esotropia**
*   **Essential/Basic:** Equal deviation for distance and near; no significant refractive error.
*   **Sensory Esotropia:** Due to monocular vision loss (e.g., cataract, optic atrophy) preventing fusion.

#### B. Divergent Squint ([[Exotropia]])
Characterized by outward deviation.

**1. Congenital Exotropia:** Rare, present at birth.
**2. Primary Exotropia:**
*   **Intermittent:** Most common. Deviation manifests during fatigue, daydreaming, or illness.
*   **Classification (Duane’s):**
    *   **Convergence Insufficiency:** Exotropia at Near > Distance.
    *   **Divergence Excess:** Exotropia at Distance > Near.
    *   **Basic:** Distance = Near.
**3. Sensory Exotropia:** Due to acquired vision loss in one eye (e.g., trauma, cataract) in adults.
**4. Consecutive Exotropia:** Occurs after surgical overcorrection of an esotropia.

### Clinical Features and Sensory Adaptations

In concomitant squint, the patient rarely complains of diplopia (unlike paralytic squint) due to sensory adaptations:

1.  **Suppression:** Active cortical inhibition of the image from the squinting eye to avoid confusion and diplopia.
2.  **[[Amblyopia]] (Lazy Eye):** Reduced visual acuity due to prolonged suppression or sensory deprivation.
    *   **Strabismic Amblyopia:** Caused by constant unilateral squint.
3.  **Anomalous Retinal Correspondence ([[ARC]]):** The fovea of the normal eye pairs with a non-foveal point in the squinting eye to maintain a crude form of binocular vision.
4.  **Eccentric Fixation:** In severe amblyopia, the eye loses foveal fixation and fixes with an extra-foveal point.

***Clinical Implication:*** *Before planning surgery, amblyopia must be treated (e.g., via occlusion therapy) to ensure the eye has the visual potential to maintain alignment post-operatively.*

### Investigations

**1. Visual Acuity Assessment**
*   Crucial to detect amblyopia. Use Snellen charts, Teller acuity cards (infants), or fixation patterns.

**2. Cover Tests**
*   **Direct Cover Test:** Detects **Manifest Squint (Tropia)**. Covering the fixing eye causes the deviated eye to move to take up fixation.
*   **Uncover Test:** Detects **Latent Squint (Phoria)**.
*   **Alternate Cover Test:** Reveals the total deviation (latent + manifest) and dissociates the eyes.

**3. Measurement of Deviation**
*   **[[Hirschberg Test]] (Corneal Reflex Test):** Rough estimation based on the position of the corneal light reflex.
    *   **Mnemonic: DOOR** (Deviation Opposite Of Reflex).
    *   Reflex at pupil margin: ~15° deviation.
    *   Reflex at limbus: ~45° deviation.
*   **[[Prism Bar Cover Test]] (PBCT):** The gold standard for measuring the angle of deviation. Prisms are placed over the eye until neutralizing movement is seen on the cover test.
*   **Krimsky Test:** Used in patients with poor vision in one eye; prisms placed over the *fixing* eye to center the reflex in the squinting eye.

**4. Assessment of Binocular Function**
*   **[[Worth 4 Dot Test]]:** Assesses fusion, suppression, or diplopia.
*   **[[Bagolini Striated Glasses]]:** Most physiological test for ARC.
*   **[[Synoptophore]]:** Measures subjective and objective angles and grades of binocular vision (SMP, Fusion, Stereopsis).

### Management

The goals are **Cosmetic** alignment, **Visual Acuity** improvement, and restoration of **Binocular Single Vision (BSV)**.

#### 1. Optical Correction
*   **Refraction:** Cycloplegic refraction is mandatory.
*   **Glasses:** Full hypermetropic correction is given for **accommodative esotropia**. Myopia should be fully corrected in exotropia to stimulate accommodation and convergence.

#### 2. Amblyopia Therapy (Occlusion)
*   **Occlusion ([[Patching]]):** The sound eye is patched to force the use of the amblyopic/squinting eye.
*   **Regimen:** Commonly, patch for days equal to age (e.g., 4:1 rhythm for a 4-year-old) to prevent occlusion amblyopia in the sound eye.
*   **Penalization:** Using Atropine drops in the sound eye to blur near vision (alternative to patching).

#### 3. Orthoptic Exercises
*   Used to improve fusional reserves and treat convergence insufficiency (e.g., pencil push-ups, synoptophore exercises).

#### 4. Surgical Management
Indicated when the deviation is cosmetically unacceptable or to restore BSV, usually if the angle is >10-20 prism diopters.

**Principles of Surgery:**
*   **Weakening Procedures:**
    *   **[[Recession]]:** Moving the muscle insertion posteriorly (towards the equator).
    *   Example: Medial Rectus Recession for Esotropia.
*   **Strengthening Procedures:**
    *   **[[Resection]]:** Shortening the muscle by excising a portion and reattaching it to the original insertion.
    *   Example: Lateral Rectus Resection for Esotropia.

**Common Surgeries:**
| Squint Type | Surgical Approach |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Esotropia** | **Bimedial Recession** (recess both MR) OR **Unilateral Recession-Resection** (Recess MR, Resect LR) |
| **Exotropia** | **Bilateral Lateral Rectus Recession** OR **Unilateral Recession-Resection** (Recess LR, Resect MR) |

**Important Rules:**
*   **Hering’s Law:** Equal innervation to yoke muscles (surgical planning must consider this).
*   **Adjustable Sutures:** Used in adults or re-surgeries to fine-tune alignment post-operatively.
