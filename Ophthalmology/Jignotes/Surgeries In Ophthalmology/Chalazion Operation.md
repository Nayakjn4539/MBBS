# [[Surgeries In Ophthalmology]] > Chalazion Operation

### **Chalazion Operation (Incision and Curettage)**

**Definition**
A [[Chalazion]] (also known as a tarsal or meibomian cyst) is a chronic, non-infective (non-suppurative) [[lipogranulomatous inflammation]] of the [[Meibomian gland]],.

**Indications for Surgery**
*   **Non-resolving lesion:** Failure of conservative treatment (hot fomentation, antibiotics) or intralesional steroids.
*   **Large size:** Causing cosmetic disfigurement or mechanical [[ptosis]].
*   **Visual disturbance:** Induced [[astigmatism]] due to pressure on the cornea (especially upper lid lesions).
*   **Fungating mass:** If the lesion bursts on the conjunctival side.

### **Surgical Instruments**

The following instruments are essential for the procedure:

| Instrument | Description | Function/Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Chalazion Clamp]]** (Forceps) | Forceps with a screw locking mechanism. One limb has a **fenestrated circular ring**; the other has a **solid plate/disc**. | • **Fixation:** Stabilizes the lid and the cyst.<br>• **Hemostasis:** Tightening the screw compresses vessels, providing a bloodless field.<br>• The ring is usually placed on the conjunctival side. |
| **[[Chalazion Scoop]]** (Curette) | A small cup with sharp margins attached to a narrow handle. | • Used to scoop/curette out the gelatinous contents of the chalazion after incision,. |
| **Scalpel Handle & Blade** | Usually a Bard-Parker handle with a sharp blade (No. 11 or No. 15),. | • To make the incision into the tarsal plate. |
| **[[Lid Spatula]]** (Lid Plate) | A simple metal plate with slightly convex surfaces at either end. | • Generally used to protect the globe and support the lid during lid surgeries (e.g., entropion). *Note: In chalazion surgery, the solid plate of the chalazion clamp usually serves this protective function*. |
| **[[Beer’s Knife]]** | *Historical context:* A knife with a triangular blade. | • Classically used for incisions, though modern practice favors disposable blades (#11/15). |

### **Surgical Procedure: Incision and Curettage (I & C)**

**1. Anaesthesia**
*   **Surface Anaesthesia:** Instillation of 4% [[Xylocaine]] drops (or 0.5% proparacaine) into the conjunctival sac,.
*   **Infiltration Anaesthesia:** Injection of 2% Xylocaine (Lignocaine) with adrenaline into the lid tissue around the chalazion,.

**2. Application of Clamp**
*   The [[Chalazion clamp]] is applied.
*   **Standard position:** The **fenestrated ring** is placed on the **conjunctival side** (inner side) surrounding the lesion, and the **solid plate** is on the **skin side**.
*   *Exception:* If the chalazion points externally towards the skin, the ring is placed on the skin side.

**3. Incision**
*   **Conjunctival Approach (Internal):** A **vertical incision** is made through the tarsal conjunctiva using a sharp blade,.
    *   *Reasoning:* To avoid cutting across adjacent normal [[Meibomian glands]] which run vertically.
*   **Skin Approach (External):** If pointing on the skin, a **horizontal incision** is made,.
    *   *Reasoning:* To ensure the scar merges with natural skin creases (Langer’s lines) and remains invisible.

**4. Curettage**
*   The [[Chalazion scoop]] is introduced through the incision.
*   The lipogranulomatous contents (jelly-like material) are thoroughly scooped out.
*   The sac/capsule should be excised if possible to prevent recurrence.

**5. Cauterization (Optional but recommended)**
*   The cavity may be cauterized with pure **carbolic acid** to destroy any remaining epithelial cells and prevent recurrence.
*   *Crucial Step:* Neutralize the acid immediately with **methylated spirit** to prevent damage to surrounding healthy tissue.

**6. Post-Operative Care**
*   The clamp is removed, and bleeding is checked (usually stops with pressure).
*   **Antibiotic eye ointment** is applied.
*   A firm **patch/pad** is applied for 6–12 hours to prevent hematoma.
*   Oral anti-inflammatory drugs and topical antibiotics are prescribed for a few days.

### **Clinical Implications & Pearls**

*   **Recurrent Chalazion:** In elderly patients, a recurrent chalazion at the same site must be biopsied to rule out **[[Sebaceous Cell Carcinoma]]** (Meibomian gland carcinoma),.
*   **Marginal Chalazion:** These are difficult to curette. Destruction by **diathermy** is often the treatment of choice.
*   **Intralesional Steroids:** For small/soft chalazia or those near the [[puncta]] (where incision carries risk of damage), intralesional injection of **[[Triamcinolone]]** (long-acting steroid) is an effective alternative to surgery,.
