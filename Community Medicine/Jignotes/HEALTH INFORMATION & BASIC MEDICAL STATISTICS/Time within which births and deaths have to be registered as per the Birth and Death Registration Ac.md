# [[HEALTH INFORMATION & BASIC MEDICAL STATISTICS]] > Time within which births and deaths have to be registered as per the Birth and Death Registration Act

### Registration of Births and Deaths

Under the **[[Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969]]** (which came into force on **1st April 1970**), the registration of these vital events is compulsory in India. The act facilitates the unification of the civil registration system.

#### Time Limit for Registration
The standard time limit for registering the event of birth and that of death is **[[21 days]]** uniformly all over India.

*   **Birth Registration:** Must be done within **21 days**.
*   **Death Registration:** Must be done within **21 days**.

#### Procedure for Delayed Registration
If the event is not registered within the stipulated 21 days, it can still be registered under specific conditions and penalties as prescribed by the Act:

| Time Period | Requirement for Registration |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Within 21 Days** | Free of charge (No Fee). |
| **> 21 Days but < 30 Days** | Registered on payment of a prescribed **Late Fee**. |
| **> 30 Days but < 1 Year** | Registered only with the written permission of the prescribed authority (District Registrar) and submission of an **[[Affidavit]]** from a Notary Public + Late Fee. |
| **> 1 Year** | Registered only on an **order made by a Magistrate** of the first class or an Executive Magistrate + Late Fee. |

#### Responsibility for Reporting
*   **Household Events:** The head of the household.
*   **Institutional Events (Hospitals/Nursing Homes):** The medical officer in charge or the head of the institution.

#### Registration of Child's Name
*   **Within 12 months** of birth registration: Free of charge.
*   **After 12 months** up to 15 years: With a late fee (e.g., ₹ 5.00).

### Mnemonic
**"Two-One for Everyone"**
*   **21** Days for Birth.
*   **21** Days for Death.
*(Remember the legal age for boys to marry is 21, and the registration days are also 21)*.

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Medical Officer's Duty:** In a hospital setting, it is the legal responsibility of the Medical Officer In-charge to ensure that the forms for births and deaths occurring in the institution are filled and sent to the registrar within the stipulated time.
*   **[[Cause of Death Certification]]:** For deaths, the doctor must accurately fill out the Medical Certification of Cause of Death (MCCD) which is required for registration and epidemiological statistics.
