# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Define Acute Flaccid Paralysis

### Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP)

#### **1. Definition**
**[[Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP)]]** is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) for surveillance purposes as:
*   **Sudden onset** of weakness and floppiness in any part of the body in a **child less than 15 years of age**.
*   **OR** paralysis in a person of **any age** in whom [[Orthopaedics/Jignotes/Pediatric Orthopaedics/Poliomyelitis]] is suspected.

This is a **syndromic definition** used to ensure no cases of polio are missed. It captures a broad range of conditions to maintain high sensitivity in surveillance.

#### **2. Components of the Definition**
To clinically classify a case as AFP, it must meet the following criteria:
*   **Acute**: Rapid progression of paralysis from onset to maximum severity (usually within **4 weeks**).
*   **Flaccid**: Loss of muscle tone, described as **"floppy"** (as opposed to spastic or rigid).
*   **Paralysis**: Weakness or loss of voluntary movement.

#### **3. Clinical Relevance: The "Why" Behind AFP**
The primary goal of AFP surveillance is to find every single case of [[Wild Poliovirus]] circulation. Even though polio is eradicated in many regions, surveillance must remain sensitive enough to detect importation or re-emergence.
*   **Rule of Thumb**: Even if a doctor is confident the diagnosis is *not* polio (e.g., it looks like Guillain-Barre Syndrome), it **MUST** still be reported as AFP if the patient is under 15 years old.

#### **4. Differential Diagnosis (Causes of AFP)**
While polio is the target, many other conditions present with AFP. Common differentials include:
1.  **[[Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS)]]**: Often presents with *ascending* paralysis and cytologic-albumin dissociation in CSF.
2.  **[[Transverse Myelitis]]**: Affects spinal cord; often presents with sensory loss and bladder dysfunction.
3.  **[[Traumatic Neuritis]]**: Usually affects only one limb; often history of injection (injection neuritis).
4.  **Other Enteroviruses**: Coxsackie virus, ECHO virus, Enterovirus 71.
5.  **Tumors**: Compressing the spinal cord.
6.  **Snake Bite**: Neurotoxic envenomation.

> **Mnemonic for AFP Causes:** **GET P**olio **O**ut
> *   **G** - Guillain-Barre Syndrome
> *   **E** - Enteroviruses (Non-polio)
> *   **T** - Transverse Myelitis / Traumatic Neuritis
> *   **P** - **Polio** / Poisons (Snake bite)
> *   **O** - Other (Tumors, metabolic)

#### **5. Steps in AFP Surveillance**
The management of an AFP case follows a strict protocol to ensure polio is ruled out.

**Step 1: Notification**
*   Any case meeting the AFP definition must be reported **immediately**.
*   Case investigation should ideally begin within **48 hours** of notification.

**Step 2: Stool Sample Collection ([[Adequate Stool Sample]])**
This is the **gold standard** for diagnosis. Isolation of the virus from stool is required because shedding is variable.
*   **Number**: **2** stool specimens.
*   **Timing**: Collected within **14 days** of the onset of paralysis.
*   **Interval**: At least **24 hours apart**.
*   **Quantity**: Approximately **8 grams** (size of an adult thumb).
*   **Transport**: Sent to a WHO-accredited laboratory maintaining a **[[Reverse Cold Chain]]** (temperature range **+2°C to +8°C**).

**Step 3: Outbreak Response Immunization (ORI)**
*   Immediate vaccination of children (usually 0-59 months) in the vicinity of the case to prevent spread, regardless of immunization status.

**Step 4: Follow-Up**
*   A follow-up visit is conducted **60 days** after the onset of paralysis.
*   **Purpose**: To check for **[[Residual Paralysis]]** (residual weakness).
*   Polio typically leaves permanent residual weakness, whereas conditions like GBS often resolve.

#### **6. Surveillance Indicators**
To ensure the system is working effectively, specific targets must be met:

| Indicator | Target | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Non-polio AFP Rate** | **> 1 per 100,000** population <15 years | Ensures the system is sensitive enough to find cases. (Some regions target >2) |
| **Adequate Stool Sample Rate** | **> 80%** | Ensures lab diagnosis is possible for most cases. |
