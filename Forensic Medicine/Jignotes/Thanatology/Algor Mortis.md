# [[Thanatology]] > Algor Mortis

### Definition
**[[Algor Mortis]]** (Latin: *Algor* = cold; *Mortis* = death), also known as the **"Chill of Death,"** is the progressive cooling of the body after death until it reaches equilibrium with the temperature of the surrounding environment. 

It is one of the early signs of death (cellular death).

### Mechanism
*   **Cessation of Heat Production:** After somatic death, the metabolic processes (oxidation of glycogen) responsible for heat production stop.
*   **Heat Loss:** The body loses heat to the cooler environment through physical processes:
    *   **Conduction:** Transfer of heat to the surface the body is lying on.
    *   **Convection:** Transfer of heat to the surrounding air currents.
    *   **Radiation:** Loss of heat to the surrounding atmosphere.
    *   **Evaporation:** Loss of body fluids from the skin surface.
*   **Gradient:** A temperature gradient develops from the core to the surface. The internal organs cool primarily by conduction to the surface, and the surface loses heat to the environment.

### Pattern of Cooling
The body does not cool like a uniform mass of inorganic matter (Newton's Law of Cooling does not apply strictly in the early stages). The cooling curve is **[[Sigmoid Curve|Sigmoid]]** (inverted 'S' shape),.

1.  **Initial Plateau (Lag Phase):** For the first 0.5 to 1 hour (sometimes up to 2-3 hours), the rectal temperature falls very little or not at all. This is due to residual tissue metabolism (glycogenolysis) and the time required to establish a temperature gradient from core to skin,.
2.  **Linear Phase:** Rapid fall in temperature.
3.  **Terminal Phase:** The rate slows down as the body temperature approaches the environmental temperature.

### Recording Body Temperature
To accurately assess [[Algor Mortis]], the **Core Body Temperature** must be recorded.

*   **Instrument:** A **Chemical Thermometer** (Thanatometer) is used. It is 25 cm long with a range of 0°C to 50°C,. Clinical thermometers are useless as they do not read below 35°C (95°F).
*   **Sites for Recording:**
    *   **Rectum:** Most common site. The thermometer is inserted 8–10 cm deep and reading is taken after 2 minutes.
    *   **Subhepatic Space (Liver):** Ideal/Best site. Measured by making a small midline incision below the xiphisternum,.
    *   **External Auditory Meatus:** Proximity to the base of the skull.
    *   **Nose:** Up to the cribriform plate.
    *   **Lower Esophagus**.

### Rate of Cooling
The rate varies depending on the difference between body temperature and ambient temperature.
*   **Tropical Climates:** Roughly **0.4°C to 0.7°C per hour**,.
*   **General Rule:** A naked body usually reaches environmental temperature in about **16–20 hours**.

### Factors Affecting Algor Mortis
The rate of cooling is modified by factors related to the body and the environment.

#### 1. Body Factors
*   **Age:** Children and infants cool faster due to a larger surface area-to-mass ratio. Elderly people cool faster due to less muscle and subcutaneous fat,.
*   **Build/Physique:**
    *   **Thin individuals:** Cool faster.
    *   **Obese individuals:** Cool slower because fat acts as an insulator.
*   **Cause of Death:**
    *   **Wasting diseases/Hemorrhage:** Rapid cooling.
    *   **Asphyxia/Sudden death:** Slow cooling.

#### 2. Environmental Factors
*   **Temperature:** The greater the difference between body and environmental temperature, the faster the cooling.
*   **Air Movement:** Moving air (wind/fan) accelerates cooling via convection and evaporation.
*   **Medium:** Bodies in **water** cool about twice as fast as in air because water is a better conductor of heat.
*   **Clothing:** Clothes are bad conductors of heat; a well-clothed body retains heat longer.
*   **Posture:** An extended body (supine) cools faster (more surface area exposed) than a curled-up (fetal position) body.

### Postmortem Caloricity
This is a condition where the body temperature **rises** or remains high for up to 2 hours after death instead of falling,.

**Mechanism:** Disturbance of heat regulation before death, increased heat production by muscles (convulsions), or excessive bacterial activity,.

**Causes:**
*   **P** - **P**ontine Hemorrhage
*   **S** - **S**trychnine Poisoning (due to convulsions)
*   **T** - **T**etanus
*   **S** - **S**epticemia (bacterial activity)
*   **H** - **H**eat Stroke (Sunstroke)

**Mnemonic:** **P**ost **S**cript: **T**oo **S**weaty **H**ot (**PSTSH**)

### Medicolegal Importance
1.  **Sign of Death:** A body temperature below 25°C is generally incompatible with life (except in profound induced hypothermia).
2.  **Estimation of [[Time Since Death]] (TSD):** This is the primary utility of Algor Mortis.

**Formulas for TSD Estimation:**
*   **General Formula:**
    $$ \text{TSD (hours)} = \frac{\text{Normal Body Temp} - \text{Rectal Temp}}{\text{Rate of Fall per hour}} $$
    *Note: Normal rectal temp is taken as ~37.2°C (99°F),.*

*   **Henssge's Nomogram:** A chart used to estimate TSD by correlating rectal temperature, ambient temperature, and body weight, applying correction factors for clothes and water.

*   **Rule of Thumb (in Tropical Climates):**
    *   **Body warm:** Death within 3 hours.
    *   **Body cold:** Death likely occurred > 18–24 hours ago (in summer/temperate zone),.
