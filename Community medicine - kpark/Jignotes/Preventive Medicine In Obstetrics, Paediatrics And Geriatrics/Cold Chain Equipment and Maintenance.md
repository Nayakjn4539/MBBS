# [[Preventive Medicine In Obstetrics, Paediatrics And Geriatrics]] > Cold Chain Equipment and Maintenance

### Cold Chain Equipment and Maintenance

**Definition**
The [[Cold Chain]] is a system of storage and transport of vaccines at low temperatures from the manufacturer to the actual vaccination site.
*   **Objective:** To maintain the potency of vaccines, as once lost, potency cannot be regained.
*   **Key Temperature:** generally **+2°C to +8°C** for all vaccines at the PHC level.

### Cold Chain Equipment Hierarchy

The equipment varies based on the administrative level and storage duration required.

| Level | Equipment | Temperature | Storage Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Regional/State** | **Walk-in-Coolers (WIC)** | +2°C to +8°C | 3 months |
| | **Walk-in-Freezers (WIF)** | -15°C to -25°C | 3 months |
| **District** | **Large ILR & Deep Freezers** | +2°C to +8°C / -20°C | 1 month |
| **PHC/CHC** | **Small ILR & Deep Freezers** | +2°C to +8°C / -20°C | **1 month** |
| **Sub-centre** | **Vaccine Carriers** | +2°C to +8°C | 48-72 hours |
| **Session Site** | **Vaccine Carriers/Day Carriers** | +2°C to +8°C | 1-3 hours |

### Specific Equipment Details

#### 1. Ice Lined Refrigerator (ILR)
This is the **most important component** of the cold chain in India.
*   **Mechanism:** Lined with tubes/packs filled with water that freeze and keep the cabinet cool during power cuts. It can keep vaccines safe with as little as **8 hours** of continuous electricity in a 24-hour period.
*   **Design:** Top opening (holds cold air better than front-opening domestic fridges).
*   **Organization:**
    *   **Bottom (Coolest):** Store Heat Sensitive vaccines (OPV, Measles, BCG, JE, Rotavirus).
    *   **Basket/Top (Less Cool):** Store Freeze Sensitive vaccines (Hep B, Pentavalent, DPT, IPV, TT, PCV).
    *   **Diluents:** Can be stored in the basket but must be cooled 24 hours before use.

> *   **J**E
> *   **M**easles/MR

#### 2. Deep Freezer (DF)
*   **Temperature:** -15°C to -25°C.
*   **Use:**
    *   **District Level:** Storing OPV and freezing ice packs.
    *   **PHC Level:** **ONLY** for preparation of [[Ice Packs]]. **Do not store vaccines here** (except OPV in emergencies).

#### 3. Cold Boxes
*   **Use:** Transportation of vaccines in bulk and emergency storage during breakdowns.
*   **Preparation:** Fully frozen ice packs are placed at the bottom and sides.

#### 4. Vaccine Carriers
*   **Use:** Carrying small quantities (16-20 vials) to sub-centres or outreach sessions.
*   **Specs:** Uses **4 fully frozen ice packs**. Can maintain temp for 48-72 hours.

#### 5. Ice Packs
*   **Preparation:** Filled with plain water (no salt) up to the mark. Frozen in Deep Freezer.
*   **Conditioning:** Crucial step. Frozen ice packs must be kept at room temperature until they "sweat" (droplets appear) and water is heard shaking inside. This prevents freezing of freeze-sensitive vaccines (DPT, Hep B).

### Maintenance of Cold Chain Equipment (Do's and Don'ts)

*   **Placement:** Keep ILR/DF in a cool room, away from direct sunlight, at least **10 cm away from the wall** for air circulation.
*   **Leveling:** Must be placed on a leveled surface.
*   **Power:** Use a voltage stabilizer. Plug should be secured.
*   **Temperature Monitoring:**
    *   Record temperature **twice daily**.
    *   Use a **Dial Thermometer** or Alcohol Stem Thermometer placed in the ILR.
*   **Defrosting:** Defrost periodically or when ice thickness exceeds **5mm** (0.5 cm).
*   **Storage Rules:**
    *   **DO NOT** store food, drinking water, or other drugs in the ILR.
    *   **DO NOT** keep expired vaccines.
    *   **DO NOT** keep vaccines for more than 1 month at PHC level.

### Vaccine Sensitivity

Knowing which vaccine is sensitive to what is critical for storage.

1.  **Heat Sensitive (Most to Least):**
    *   [[Reconstituted BCG]] (Most sensitive) > OPV > Measles > DPT > BCG (Powder) > TT (Least sensitive/Most heat stable).
2.  **Freeze Sensitive (Most to Least):**
    *   **Hep B** (Most sensitive) > Pentavalent > DPT > TT.
    *   *Clinical Relevance:* Freezing adsorbed vaccines (DPT, Td, Hep B) breaks the bond between antigen and adjuvant (aluminum), making the vaccine ineffective and causing sterile abscesses.

---

### Monitoring Potency

#### 1. Vaccine Vial Monitor (VVM)
A heat-sensitive label on the vial that registers cumulative heat exposure.
*   **Inner Square Lighter than Outer Circle:** Usable.
*   **Inner Square Same/Darker than Outer Circle:** **Discard Point** (Do not use).
*   *Note:* VVM measures heat exposure, **not** freezing damage.

#### 2. Shake Test
Used to check if a freeze-sensitive vaccine (DPT, Hep B, Penta, TT) has been damaged by freezing.
*   **Procedure:** Shake the suspect vial and a control vial (frozen and thawed). Allow to settle.
*   **Interpretation:** If the suspect vial settles **faster** than the control (clear supernatant, flakes at bottom), it is **DAMAGED**. If it settles slower (cloudy), it is safe.

### Important Policies

*   **[[Open Vial Policy]]:** Opened vials of DPT, TT, Hep B, OPV, Pentavalent, and IPV can be used for up to **28 days** if stored properly, VVM is valid, and not submerged in water.
    *   *Exception:* **Measles, BCG, JE, and Rotavirus** must be discarded after 4 hours of reconstitution or at the end of the session.
*   **Reverse Cold Chain:** Transporting stool samples for Polio surveillance from the field to the laboratory at +2°C to +8°C.
