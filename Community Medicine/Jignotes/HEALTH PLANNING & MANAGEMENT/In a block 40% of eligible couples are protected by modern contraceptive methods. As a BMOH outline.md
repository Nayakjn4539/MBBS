# [[HEALTH PLANNING & MANAGEMENT]] > In a block 40% of eligible couples are protected by modern contraceptive methods. As a BMOH outline the intervention to improve the situation.

### Situation Analysis and Goal Setting

As the **Block Medical Officer of Health (BMOH)**, the current [[Couple Protection Rate (CPR)]] of 40% indicates that a significant portion of [[Eligible Couples]] (approx. 60%) are unprotected against unwanted pregnancies. The immediate goal is to increase the CPR to **>60%** to achieve a **Net Reproduction Rate (NRR) of 1** (Replacement level fertility).

The intervention plan will follow the **Community Needs Assessment Approach (CNAA)** rather than a top-down target approach.

### 1. Planning and Situation Assessment

*   **Update Eligible Couple Register:** Direct the [[ANM (Auxiliary Nurse Midwife)]] and ASHA workers to conduct a house-to-house survey to update the **Eligible Couple Register** at every [[Sub-centre]].
*   **Identify Unmet Needs:** Categorize couples based on their needs:
    *   **Spacing Methods:** For young couples with 0–1 child.
    *   **Terminal Methods:** For couples with 2+ children who have completed their family size.
*   **Analyze Dropouts:** Identify couples who discontinued contraception and investigate the reasons (side effects, supply issues, myths).

### 2. Supply-Side Interventions (Service Delivery)

To ensure **"Cafeteria Choice"** (offering a basket of choices), the following measures will be taken:

| Method | Intervention Strategy |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Spacing Methods** | Ensure availability of **[[IUCD 380A]]** (10 years) and **CuT 375** (5 years). <br> Promotion of **PPIUCD** (Post-Partum IUCD) immediately after institutional deliveries. |
| **New Contraceptives** | Roll out **[[Antara Program]]** (Injectable MPA) and **[[Chhaya]]** (Centchroman pills) at PHC and Sub-centre levels. |
| **Terminal Methods** | Implement **Fixed Day Static (FDS) Services**: <br> - **PHC:** Monthly sterilization camps. <br> - **CHC:** Fortnightly services. <br> Promote **[[No Scalpel Vasectomy (NSV)]]** as a painless, stitch-less male sterilization method. |
| **Home Delivery** | Strengthen the scheme of **Home Delivery of Contraceptives** (Condoms, OCPs, ECPs) by [[ASHA]] workers at the doorstep for a nominal charge. |

### 3. Demand-Side Interventions (IEC and Motivation)

*   **Behavior Change Communication (BCC):** Utilize **Village Health and Nutrition Days (VHNDs)** to dispel myths regarding sterilization and IUCDs.
*   **Focus on Male Participation:** Active counseling for NSV during the "Vasectomy Fortnight" (November).
*   **Counseling Strategy:** Instruct health workers to use the **GATHER approach** (Greet, Ask, Tell, Help, Explain, Return) for counseling eligible couples.
*   **Incentives:** Ensure timely disbursement of compensation schemes (e.g., for sterilization) and ASHA incentives to maintain motivation.

### 4. Manpower and Capacity Building

*   **Training:** Organise refresher training for ANMs and Staff Nurses on **IUCD insertion** and **Minilap** assistance.
*   **Sensitization:** Train [[Anganwadi Worker]] and ASHAs to identify high-risk pregnancies and motivate them for post-partum sterilization.
*   **Quality Assurance:** Ensure adherence to medical standards to prevent complications, which is vital for building community trust.

### 5. Monitoring and Evaluation

*   **Review Meetings:** Conduct monthly reviews at the Block level to assess the **Eligible Couple Protection Rate**.
*   **Feedback:** Gather feedback from the community regarding the availability and behavior of staff.
*   **Logistics Management:** Use the Family Planning Management Information System (FPMIS) to prevent stock-outs of OCPs (Mala-N) and Condoms (Nirodh).

### Clinical Relevance: Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) Wheel
While increasing CPR, the BMOH must ensure staff uses the **WHO MEC Wheel** to avoid contraindications:
*   **Combined OCPs:** Avoid in smokers >35 years, history of DVT/Stroke, or uncontrolled hypertension.
*   **IUCD:** Avoid in active Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) or unexplained vaginal bleeding.

### Mnemonic: "ACT NOW" to improve CPR
*   **A** - **A**ssess Unmet Needs (Update Registers).
*   **C** - **C**afeteria Approach (Widen basket of choice: Antara/Chhaya).
*   **T** - **T**rain ASHA/ANM on GATHER counseling.
*   **N** - **N**o Scalpel Vasectomy promotion (Male participation).
*   **O** - **O**rganize Fixed Day Services (FDS).
*   **W** - **W**elfare/Incentives (Timely payments).
