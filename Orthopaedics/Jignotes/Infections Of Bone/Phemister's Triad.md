# [[Infections Of Bone]] > Phemister's Triad

# Phemister's Triad (Tuberculosis of the Knee)

[[Phemister's triad]] refers to a characteristic cluster of **radiological findings** seen in [[Tuberculous Arthritis]]. While applicable to various joints, it is classically described in the context of [[Tuberculosis of the Knee]] and the [[Hip]]. These signs help differentiate tubercular infection from pyogenic (septic) arthritis.

### The Triad Components

The classical radiological triad described by Phemister includes:

1.  **Severe [[Juxta-articular Osteoporosis]]**:
    *   There is diffuse rarefaction of the bones surrounding the joint.
    *   **Pathophysiology:** This occurs due to local **hyperemia** (increased blood flow caused by inflammation) and **disuse atrophy** (muscle wasting and reduced weight-bearing due to pain),.
    *   In the knee, this manifests as decreased bone density in the distal [[Femur]] and proximal [[Tibia]].

2.  **Marginal Bony Erosions**:
    *   Also known as **osseous erosions**.
    *   The erosions typically begin at the **periphery** of the articular surface (non-weight bearing areas).
    *   **Pathophysiology:** The tubercular **pannus** (hypertrophied synovium) starts at the synovial reflections and creeps over the articular cartilage, eroding the underlying bone from the margins inward,.

3.  **Gradual Narrowing of the [[Joint Space]]**:
    *   Unlike [[Septic Arthritis]], where joint space is lost rapidly, in TB, the joint space is **preserved** for a relatively long duration.
    *   **Pathophysiology:** Tuberculous exudate lacks the proteolytic enzymes (specifically collagenases) found in pyogenic infections. Therefore, the **articular cartilage** is resistant to destruction for a longer period.
    *   *Note:* In very early stages, the joint space may actually appear **widened** due to joint effusion. Narrowing happens in the stage of advanced arthritis.

### Comparison: TB Arthritis vs. Pyogenic Arthritis

This triad is essential for differential diagnosis.

| Feature | [[Tuberculous Arthritis]] (Phemister's Triad) | [[Pyogenic Arthritis]] (Septic) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Osteoporosis** | **Severe** and regional (Juxta-articular). | Mild or absent initially; sclerotic later. |
| **Joint Space** | **Preserved** until late stages (Cartilage resists destruction). | **Rapid loss** (Proteolytic enzymes destroy cartilage early). |
| **Erosions** | **Marginal/Peripheral** erosions first. | Central erosions in weight-bearing areas. |
| **Course** | Indolent, chronic course. | Acute, fulminant course. |

### Clinical Implications

*   **Diagnosis:** The presence of this triad on a plain **X-ray** in a patient with a chronic, swollen, painful knee (monoarticular) strongly suggests [[Tuberculosis]].
*   **Stage of Disease:** These signs usually appear in the **Stage of Early Arthritis**.
    *   *Stage of Synovitis:* Soft tissue swelling, widening of joint space, osteoporosis.
    *   *Stage of Early Arthritis:* Marginal erosions, gradual narrowing.
    *   *Stage of Advanced Arthritis:* Complete loss of joint space, subluxation, triple deformity,.

### Associated Deformities (The Clinical Triad)

While Phemister's triad is radiological, untreated TB knee develops a **Clinical Triad** of deformity known as **Triple Deformity** (Triple Displacement):
1.  **Posterior Subluxation** of the tibia.
2.  **Lateral Rotation** (External rotation) of the tibia.
3.  **Flexion** of the knee.

*This occurs due to the laxity of ligaments (cruciates) and the pull of the hamstring muscles*.

### Mnemonics

To remember **Phemister's Triad**: **"J-O-E"**
*   **J** - **J**oint space preserved (initially)
*   **O** - **O**steoporosis (Juxta-articular)
*   **E** - **E**rosions (Marginal)

To remember **Triple Deformity** (Clinical): **"FLEx-P"**
*   **F** - **F**lexion
*   **L** - **L**ateral rotation (**Ex**ternal rotation)
*   **P** - **P**osterior subluxation
