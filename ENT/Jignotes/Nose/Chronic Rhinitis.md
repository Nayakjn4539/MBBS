# Chronic Rhinitis

**Chronic Rhinitis** is defined as a chronic inflammation of the nasal mucosa causing symptoms like nasal obstruction, discharge, and sneezing. It is traditionally classified into specific pathological entities based on the mucosal changes.

**Classification of Chronic Rhinitis:**
1.  **Chronic Simple Rhinitis**
2.  **Chronic Hypertrophic Rhinitis**
3.  **Atrophic Rhinitis (Ozaena)**
4.  **Rhinitis Sicca**
5.  **Rhinitis Caseosa**
6.  **Rhinitis Medicamentosa**

### 1. Chronic Simple Rhinitis
This is the early stage of chronic rhinitis where the pathological changes are reversible. It is often an advanced stage of unresolved [[acute rhinitis]].

**Etiology:**
*   **Recurrent infections:** Recurrent [[acute rhinitis]] or chronic tonsillitis/adenoids.
*   **Chronic irritation:** Dust, smoke, cigarette smoking, snuff.
*   **Nasal obstruction:** [[Deviated Nasal Septum]] (DNS), synechiae.
*   **Vasomotor instability:** [[Vasomotor rhinitis]].
*   **Endocrine/Metabolic:** Hypothyroidism, obesity.

**Pathology:**
*   Chronic hyperemia and edema of the mucous membrane.
*   Distension of blood sinusoids (especially over turbinates).
*   Increase in goblet cells (loss of cilia is reversible).

**Clinical Features:**
*   **Nasal Obstruction:** Worse when lying down; affects the dependent side.
*   **Nasal Discharge:** Mucoid or mucopurulent; often associated with [[postnasal drip]] (PND).
*   **Swollen Turbinates:** On [[anterior rhinoscopy]], mucosa appears swollen and congested.
*   **Pitting Test:** The swollen mucosa **pits on pressure**.
*   **Vasoconstrictor Test:** Tumors shrink significantly with vasoconstrictor drops (e.g., Xylometazoline).

**Treatment:**
*   Treat the underlying cause (e.g., adenoids, sinusitis).
*   **Nasal Irrigations:** Alkaline nasal douche.
*   **Topical Decongestants:** To relieve obstruction (short term).
*   **Antibiotics:** For secondary infection.

### 2. Chronic Hypertrophic Rhinitis
This is the advanced, permanent stage of chronic rhinitis characterized by irreversible hypertrophy of the mucosa, submucosa, and even bone.

**Pathology:**
*   Thickening of mucosa, submucosa, periosteum, and bone.
*   **Fibrosis** prevents shrinkage.
*   Venous sinusoids lose their contractility.

**Clinical Features:**
*   **Nasal Obstruction:** Constant and severe.
*   **Discharge:** Thick and sticky.
*   **Turbinate Hypertrophy:**
    *   **Inferior Turbinate:** Most commonly affected. The anterior end looks pebbly; the posterior end shows **Mulberry Hypertrophy** (pale/white due to fibrosis).
    *   **Middle Turbinate:** May undergo polypoidal changes.
*   **Negative Pitting Test:** Mucosa does **not** pit on pressure due to fibrosis.
*   **Negative Vasoconstrictor Test:** Minimal or no shrinkage with decongestants.

**Treatment:**
Since changes are irreversible, surgery is often required to reduce the size of turbinates.
*   **Conservative Surgery:** Linear cautery, submucosal diathermy, cryosurgery, or radiofrequency ablation.
*   **Turbinectomy:** Partial or total [[inferior turbinectomy]] (to remove the obstructive bulk).

**Table: Differences between Chronic Simple and Hypertrophic Rhinitis**

| Feature | Chronic Simple Rhinitis | Chronic Hypertrophic Rhinitis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pathology** | Edema, vascular engorgement | Fibrosis of mucosa and bone |
| **Reversibility** | Reversible | Irreversible |
| **Pitting on Pressure** | **Present** | **Absent** |
| **Shrinkage with Decongestants** | **Good shrinkage** | **No/Little shrinkage** |
| **Appearance** | Smooth, congested | Mulberry hypertrophy (pitted) |
| **Treatment** | Medical (conservative) | Surgical (Turbinectomy) |

### 3. Atrophic Rhinitis (Ozaena)
A chronic inflammatory disease characterized by progressive atrophy of the nasal mucosa and underlying bone (turbinates), leading to roomy nasal cavities filled with foul-smelling crusts.

**Types:**
1.  **Primary (Idiopathic):** Classic form.
2.  **Secondary:** Due to specific infections ([[syphilis]], lupus, leprosy, rhinoscleroma), excessive surgical destruction of turbinates (Empty Nose Syndrome), or radiation.

**Etiology of Primary Atrophic Rhinitis:**
*(Mnemonic: **HERNIA**)*
*   **H**ereditary: Strong familial tendency.
*   **E**ndocrine: Pubertal females (estrogen deficiency).
*   **R**acial: Common in Whites/Yellow races.
*   **N**utritional: Vitamin A, D, or Iron deficiency.
*   **I**nfective: *Klebsiella ozaenae* (Perez bacillus), *Coccobacillus foetidus*, Diphtheroids.
*   **A**utoimmune: Viral triggers causing antigenicity of nasal mucosa.

**Pathology:**
*   **Metaplasia:** Ciliated columnar epithelium transforms into **stratified squamous epithelium**.
*   **Atrophy:** Loss of seromucinous glands, nerves, and blood vessels (obliterative endarteritis).
*   **Resorption:** Turbinate bones atrophy, making the nasal cavity **roomy**.

**Clinical Features:**
*   **Foul Smell (Ozaena):** Characteristic stench from the nose.
*   **Merciful Anosmia:** The patient cannot smell the stench due to atrophy of olfactory nerves, but those around them can.
*   **Nasal Obstruction:** Paradoxical sensation of blockage despite **roomy nasal cavities** (due to crusting and lack of air resistance sensation).
*   **Crusting:** Greenish-yellow crusts filling the cavity.
*   **Epistaxis:** On removal of crusts.

**Examination Findings:**
*   Roomy nasal cavities (posterior pharyngeal wall clearly visible).
*   Atrophied turbinates.
*   Greenish-yellow crusts.

**Treatment:**
*   **Medical (Conservative):**
    *   **Nasal Irrigation:** With **Alkaline Nasal Douche** to loosen crusts.
        *   *Composition:* Sodium bicarbonate (1 part) + Sodium biborate (1 part) + Sodium chloride (2 parts).
    *   **25% Glucose in Glycerine:** Glucose inhibits proteolytic organisms (Klebsiella); Glycerine lubricates.
    *   **Kemicetine Solution:** Chloramphenicol + Estradiol + Vit D2.
    *   **Antibiotics:** Systemic (e.g., Ciprofloxacin) for secondary infection.
*   **Surgical:**
    *   **Young’s Operation:** Complete closure of nostrils for 6 months to rest the mucosa and prevent drying.
    *   **Modified Young’s Operation:** Partial closure leaving a 3mm hole (better tolerated).
    *   Narrowing the nasal cavity using implants (Teflon, fat, cartilage).

**Clinical Implication:**
> In a patient with **roomy nasal cavities** complaining of **nasal obstruction** and **foul smell** which they cannot perceive themselves, suspect **Atrophic Rhinitis**. Always rule out secondary causes like Syphilis or Rhinoscleroma.

### 4. Rhinitis Sicca
A condition of dryness of the nasal mucosa seen in hot, dry, and dusty environments.

*   **Occupation:** Bakers, goldsmiths, iron-smiths.
*   **Site:** Confined to the **anterior one-third** of the nose (unlike atrophic rhinitis which is diffuse).
*   **Pathology:** Squamous metaplasia, atrophy of glands, crusting.
*   **Features:** Dryness, crusting, epistaxis (on removal of crusts), potentially leading to **septal perforation**.
*   **Treatment:** Correction of surroundings, emollients/lubricants, alkaline douche.

---

### 5. Rhinitis Caseosa
A rare, usually unilateral condition characterized by the accumulation of offensive, cheesy, cholesteatoma-like mass in the nose.

*   **Etiology:** Obstruction to sinus drainage or nasal passage leading to stagnation and putrefaction of debris. May be associated with chronic sinusitis or fungal infection.
*   **Features:** Unilateral obstruction, foul-smelling purulent discharge, cheesy debris. Can cause bony destruction.
*   **Treatment:** Removal of debris/granulations and establishing drainage.

---

### 6. Rhinitis Medicamentosa
A condition of rebound nasal congestion caused by the prolonged overuse of topical nasal decongestants (e.g., oxymetazoline, xylometazoline).

*   **Pathophysiology:** Prolonged vasoconstriction leads to ischemia and receptor downregulation $\rightarrow$ rebound vasodilation when the drug wears off $\rightarrow$ patient uses more drops $\rightarrow$ vicious cycle.
*   **Signs:** Red, boggy, edematous mucosa.
*   **Prevention:** Limit topical decongestants to < 5-7 days.
*   **Treatment:** STOP the decongestant immediately. Start topical/systemic **corticosteroids**.
