# [[Glaucoma]] > Normal Tension Glaucoma and Ocular Hypertension

# [[Ocular Hypertension]] (OHT)

### Definition
[[Ocular Hypertension]] is defined as a condition where the [[Intraocular Pressure]] (IOP) is consistently raised (>21 mmHg) but there are **no** detectable changes in the [[Optic Nerve Head]] or [[Visual Fields]].

### Clinical Significance
It acts as a major risk factor for the development of [[Primary Open Angle Glaucoma]] (POAG). Patients with OHT are essentially "Glaucoma Suspects".

### Risk Factors for Conversion to POAG
According to the **Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS)** and European Glaucoma Prevention Study (EGPS), the high-risk factors for developing [[Glaucoma]] among individuals with OHT include:

1.  **IOP:** Consistently > 30 mmHg.
2.  **[[Central Corneal Thickness]] (CCT):** Thin CCT (< 555 $\mu$m) is a significant independent risk factor (Note: Thin cornea leads to underestimation of true IOP).
3.  **Optic Disc:** Vertical [[Cup-Disc Ratio]] > 0.7.
4.  **Age:** Increased age.
5.  **Perimetry:** Increased Pattern Standard Deviation (PSD) on Humphrey visual field test.
6.  **Hemorrhage:** Presence of [[Disc Hemorrhage]] (Splinter hemorrhage).

**Other Associated Risk Factors:**
*   Family history of glaucoma.
*   [[Myopia]].
*   Systemic factors: [[Diabetes Mellitus]], [[Hypertension]], cardiovascular disease.

### Management
The goal is to prevent the onset of glaucomatous damage.

*   **High-Risk Patients:** Treat as POAG. The aim is to reduce IOP by **20%**.
*   **Low-Risk Patients:** Periodic follow-up (annually) with optic disc evaluation, perimetry, and tonometry. Treatment is not required until damage is documented.

# [[Normal Tension Glaucoma]] (NTG)

### Definition
[[Normal Tension Glaucoma]] (also known as Low Tension Glaucoma) is a clinical entity characterized by:
*   Typical glaucomatous [[Optic Neuropathy]] (cupping).
*   Specific glaucomatous [[Visual Field Defects]].
*   **Open angle** on [[Gonioscopy]].
*   **[[Intraocular Pressure]]** consistently **$\le$ 21 mmHg** (statistically normal range).

### Epidemiology
*   Constitutes approximately **16%** of all POAG cases.
*   Prevalence is 0.2% in population > 40 years.

### Etiopathogenesis
The exact cause is unknown, but two main theories exist:
1.  **Vascular Insufficiency Theory:** Chronic low vascular perfusion renders the optic nerve head susceptible to damage even at "normal" IOP levels.
2.  **Mechanical Theory:** The lamina cribrosa may be structurally weak, collapsing even under normal pressure.

**Systemic Associations (Vascular/Vasospastic factors):**
*   **[[Raynaud's Phenomenon]]** (peripheral vascular spasm on cooling).
*   **[[Migraine]]**.
*   **Nocturnal Systemic [[Hypotension]]** ("Dippers" – patients taking anti-hypertensives at night causing low BP during sleep, reducing optic nerve perfusion).
*   **[[Sleep Apnea]]**.

### Clinical Features
The features are similar to [[Primary Open Angle Glaucoma]] but with specific distinctions:

| Feature | [[Normal Tension Glaucoma]] (NTG) | [[Primary Open Angle Glaucoma]] (POAG) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IOP** | Consistently $\le$ 21 mmHg (usually high normal). | > 21 mmHg. |
| **Optic Disc** | Thinning of **[[Neuroretinal Rim]]** is more significant. **[[Splinter Hemorrhages]]** (Drance hemorrhages) are more frequent. **[[Peripapillary Atrophy]]** is more prevalent. | Generalized cupping; hemorrhages less frequent than NTG. |
| **Visual Fields** | Defects are **deeper**, **steeper**, more **localized**, and closer to fixation (**Paracentral**). | Classic arcuate scotomas; peripheral breakthrough. |

### Differential Diagnosis
Before diagnosing NTG, exclude causes of "pseudo-normal" pressure or non-glaucomatous optic neuropathy:
1.  **Diurnal Variation:** POAG with IOP spikes at unmeasured times (e.g., early morning).
2.  **Pachymetry:** Thick [[Central Corneal Thickness]] (CCT) giving falsely low IOP readings.
3.  **"Burned-out" Glaucoma:** Previous high IOP (e.g., steroid-induced or uveitic) that has now normalized but left damage.
4.  **Non-Glaucomatous Neuropathies:**
    *   [[Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy]] (AION).
    *   Compressive lesions (e.g., pituitary tumors) – Rule out with Neuroimaging.
    *   Congenital anomalies: [[Optic Disc Pit]], Coloboma.

### Investigations
1.  **Diurnal Variation Test (DVT):** To rule out intermittent IOP spikes.
2.  **[[Central Corneal Thickness]] (CCT):** To rule out thin corneas leading to underestimation of IOP.
3.  **Systemic Workup:** 24-hour Blood Pressure monitoring (to detect nocturnal dips), Carotid Doppler, autoimmune profile.
4.  **Neuroimaging (MRI):** If field defects are atypical (e.g., respect vertical meridian) or pallor exceeds cupping.

### Management
The goal is to lower IOP by **30%** from baseline (Target IOP: 12–14 mmHg) to improve perfusion gradient.

**1. Medical Therapy:**
*   **[[Prostaglandin Analogues]] (e.g., [[Latanoprost]]):** Drug of choice. Increases uveoscleral outflow; effective at low pressures.
*   **[[Betaxolol]]:** A Beta-1 selective blocker. Preferred over non-selective blockers because it may increase **optic nerve blood flow** and has less systemic side effects.
*   **[[Brimonidine]]:** Alpha-2 agonist with potential **neuroprotective** properties.
*   **Caution:** Avoid non-selective beta-blockers (e.g., Timolol) at bedtime as they may cause systemic hypotension and reduce optic nerve perfusion further. Avoid vasoconstrictors.

**2. Systemic Therapy:**
*   **Calcium Channel Blockers (e.g., [[Nifedipine]]):** May be useful for patients with peripheral vasospasm to improve blood flow.

**3. Surgical Therapy:**
*   **[[Trabeculectomy]]:** Indicated if progressive visual field loss occurs despite IOP in the low teens.
