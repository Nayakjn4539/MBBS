# [[Autopsy]] > Types and medicolegal importance of Autopsy

### **Definition**
**[[Autopsy]]** (Greek *autos* = self, *opis* = view; "to see for oneself") is the scientific and systematic examination of a dead body.
*   **Synonyms:** [[Necropsy]] (more appropriate term, *necros* = dead), *Sectio cadaveris*, Postmortem examination, Thanatopsy.

### **Classification / Types of Autopsy**

Autopsies are broadly classified based on their purpose and methodology:

#### **1. Medicolegal (Forensic) Autopsy**
This is the most common type performed by forensic experts.
*   **Objective:** To aid in the administration of justice and protect the rights of citizens. It aims to establish the identity, cause, and manner of death.
*   **Authorization:** Carried out **only** on the written requisition of a legal authority (Investigating Police Officer not below the rank of Head Constable or a Magistrate).
*   **Consent:** Consent of the relatives is **NOT required**. It is a statutory obligation.
*   **Completeness:** It must be comprehensive. All body cavities (cranial, thoracic, abdominal) must be opened. Partial autopsies have no place in forensic practice as evidence in one organ may be crucial even if pathology is found in another.

#### **2. Clinical (Pathological / Hospital) Autopsy**
*   **Objective:** To determine the exact nature of the disease, confirm the clinical diagnosis, evaluate the effectiveness of therapy, and for academic/research interest.
*   **Authorization:** Requested by the treating physician.
*   **Consent:** Written informed **consent from the next of kin** is **mandatory**.
*   **Completeness:** Can be limited to a specific organ or region as per the consent given by relatives (e.g., chest only).

#### **3. Academic (Anatomical) Autopsy**
*   **Objective:** Performed by anatomy students for the study of normal structure and gross anatomy.
*   **Source:** Usually unclaimed bodies or bodies donated via voluntary body donation programs.
*   **Preservation:** Bodies are embalmed (preserved with formalin) prior to dissection.

#### **4. Psychological Autopsy**
*   **Definition:** An investigative procedure to reconstruct the deceased's state of mind prior to death.
*   **Indication:** [[Equivocal deaths]] (where the manner of death—suicide or accident—is unclear).
*   **Method:** Involves systematic collection of data through structured interviews with family, friends, and doctors, and review of personal documents (diaries, medical records). It helps determine if the deceased had suicidal intent.

#### **5. Virtual Autopsy (Virtopsy)**
*   **Definition:** A non-invasive or minimally invasive technique using imaging technologies.
*   **Method:** Utilization of **[[CT Scan]]** (for bony injuries, gas embolism, projectiles) and **MRI** (for soft tissues) combined with 3D surface scanning (photogrammetry).
*   **Advantages:** "Scalpel-free," creates a permanent digital record that can be reviewed anytime, religious/cultural acceptability.
*   **Disadvantage:** Cannot distinguish infection, subtle tissue pathology, or obtain toxicology samples directly without needle biopsy.

#### **6. Verbal Autopsy**
*   **Definition:** A method used to estimate cause-specific mortality in populations without medical certification of death.
*   **Method:** Retrospective interview of family members/caregivers about the signs and symptoms leading to death. Used primarily for **Infant Mortality** statistics and epidemiological data.

#### **7. Negative and Obscure Autopsy**
*   **[[Negative Autopsy]]:** When gross, microscopic, and toxicological examinations fail to reveal a cause of death. (Seen in 2–5% of cases).
*   **[[Obscure Autopsy]]:** When the autopsy findings are minimal, indeterminate, or obscure, requiring detailed ancillary investigations (histopathology, toxicology) to arrive at a conclusion.

### **Difference between Clinical and Medicolegal Autopsy**

| Feature | **Clinical / Pathological Autopsy** | **Medicolegal / Forensic Autopsy** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Objective** | To confirm diagnosis/Research | To determine cause & manner of death for justice |
| **Requisition** | Treating Physician | Police or Magistrate |
| **Consent** | **Mandatory** (Next of kin) | **Not Required** |
| **Identity** | Usually known | May be unknown (requires establishment) |
| **Procedure** | Can be partial/limited | Must be **complete** (all 3 cavities) |
| **Body handling** | Can be embalmed prior | **Never embalmed** prior to autopsy |
| **Clothing** | Usually absent/removed | Examined for trace evidence |

### **Medicolegal Importance (Objectives) of Autopsy**

The primary aim is to answer the **"6 Ws"**: *Who, When, Where, Why, What, and Which.*

**1. Identity of the Deceased:**
   *   Establishing identity in cases of unknown, decomposed, mutilated, or skeletonized bodies using anthropometry, odontology, DNA, scars, and tattoos.

**2. Cause of Death:**
   *   Determining the pathological or traumatic cause (e.g., Stab wound to the heart, Myocardial Infarction).
   *   Differentiating between **Natural** and **Unnatural** deaths.

**3. Time Since Death (Postmortem Interval - PMI):**
   *   Estimating the time of death helps either implicate or clear suspects (alibi verification).
   *   assessed using [[Rigor Mortis]], [[Algor Mortis]], [[Postmortem Lividity]], and decomposition changes.

**4. Manner of Death:**
   *   Opinion on whether the death was **Suicidal, Homicidal, or Accidental**.
   *   *Example:* Identifying hesitation cuts suggests suicide; defense wounds suggest homicide.

**5. Nature of Injuries and Weapon:**
   *   Documenting the type, number, and dimensions of injuries.
   *   Deducing the **weapon** used (e.g., Patterned abrasions, size of stab wound vs. knife width).
   *   Determining if injuries were **Antemortem** (vital reaction present) or **Postmortem**.

**6. Viability in Newborns:**
   *   In cases of [[Infanticide]], determining if the child was **Live-born**, **Dead-born**, or **Stillborn**.

**7. Collection of Evidence:**
   *   Preservation of **[[Viscera]]** for toxicology in poisoning cases.
   *   Recovery of bullets, pellets, or foreign bodies.
   *   Collection of DNA samples (blood, hair, nail clippings) in sexual assault or struggle cases.

**8. Reconstruction of the Crime Scene:**
   *   Correlating autopsy findings (e.g., direction of blood flow, position of hypostasis) with the position of the body at the crime scene.

### **Important Mnemonics**

**Objectives of Autopsy:** **"3 C's and T"**
*   **C**ause of death
*   **C**ircumstances (Manner)
*   **C**ulprit (Identity of accused via trace evidence) / **C**orpse Identity
*   **T**ime since death

**Incisions in Autopsy:** **"I-Y-X"**
*   **I** - shaped: Standard midline (Chin to Pubis).
*   **Y** - shaped: Cosmetic (Shoulders to xiphisternum to pubis).
*   **X** - shaped: Deep dissection (Back of the body/limbs).
