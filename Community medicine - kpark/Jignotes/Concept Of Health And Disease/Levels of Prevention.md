# [[Concept Of Health And Disease]] > Levels of Prevention

### Levels of Prevention

The concept of prevention is broad-based and relates directly to the [[Natural History of Disease]]. Prevention is defined in terms of four levels, corresponding to different phases of disease progression.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> A schematic diagram correlating the Natural History of Disease (Pre-pathogenesis and Pathogenesis phases) with the four Levels of Prevention and their Modes of Intervention.

### 1. Primordial Prevention
This is the prevention of the **emergence or development of risk factors** in countries or population groups in which they have not yet appeared. This is primary prevention in its purest sense.

*   **Phase of Disease:** Underlying conditions leading to causation.
*   **Target:** Total population or selected groups.
*   **Main Intervention:** [[Health Education]] (Individual and Mass education).
*   **Focus:** Discouraging the adoption of harmful lifestyles (e.g., smoking, physical inactivity, poor diet) often before they become established habits.
*   **Clinical Relevance:** Best suited for [[Non-communicable Diseases]] (NCDs) like coronary heart disease, hypertension, and obesity.
*   **Example:** Educating school children about the dangers of tobacco to prevent them from starting smoking; promoting physical activity to prevent the development of obesity.

### 2. Primary Prevention
Action taken **prior to the onset of disease**, which removes the possibility that a disease will ever occur. It signifies intervention in the **Pre-pathogenesis phase** of a disease.

*   **Phase of Disease:** Pre-pathogenesis (Risk factors are present, but disease has not started).
*   **Target:** Total population, selected groups, and healthy individuals.
*   **Concept:** Holistic approach; includes the concept of "Positive Health".
*   **Modes of Intervention:**
    1.  **[[Health Promotion]]:** Strengthening the host through non-specific measures.
        *   *Examples:* Health education, environmental modifications (safe water), nutritional interventions, lifestyle changes.
    2.  **[[Specific Protection]]:** Measures to prevent specific diseases.
        *   *Examples:* [[Immunization]], [[Chemoprophylaxis]] (e.g., Vitamin A), use of specific nutrients (iodized salt), protection against occupational hazards (PPE), protection against accidents (helmets/seatbelts), condoms for STDs.

> **Mnemonic for Primary vs. Primordial:**
> *   **Primordial:** Prevent the **R**isk factor (e.g., Prevent obesity so HTN doesn't happen).
> *   **Primary:** Prevent the **D**isease (e.g., Risk factor like mosquito is present, use bed net to prevent Malaria).

### 3. Secondary Prevention
Action which **halts the progress of a disease** at its incipient stage and prevents complications. It is the domain of clinical medicine.

*   **Phase of Disease:** Early Pathogenesis (Disease has started but may be asymptomatic).
*   **Target:** Patients/Individuals with established disease.
*   **Modes of Intervention:**
    1.  **[[Early Diagnosis]]:** Detection of disturbances while changes are still reversible.
        *   *Examples:* [[Screening tests]] (Pap smear, Mammography), contact tracing, case finding.
    2.  **[[Treatment]]:** Shortens period of communicability, reduces mortality, and prevents secondary cases.
        *   *Examples:* [[DOTS]] for Tuberculosis, MDT for Leprosy, mass drug administration.
*   **Clinical Relevance:** Essential for diseases like TB and Leprosy to interrupt transmission. It is often more expensive and less effective than primary prevention ("Imperact tool").

### 4. Tertiary Prevention
All measures available to reduce or limit impairments and disabilities, and to minimize suffering caused by existing departures from good health.

*   **Phase of Disease:** Late Pathogenesis (Advanced disease).
*   **Target:** Patients with advanced disease/disability.
*   **Modes of Intervention:**
    1.  **[[Disability Limitation]]:** Preventing the transition of disease/impairment into handicap.
        *   *Example:* Vasodilators in cardiac arrest to prevent death/damage; plaster casts for fractures.
    2.  **[[Rehabilitation]]:** Combined use of medical, social, educational, and vocational measures to train the individual to the highest possible level of functional ability.
        *   *Types:* Medical (restoration of function), Vocational (earning livelihood), Social (family restoration), Psychological (confidence).
        *   *Examples:* Reconstructive surgery in leprosy, artificial limbs, schools for the blind.

### The Sequence of Disability (WHO)
To understand Tertiary prevention, one must understand the sequence of events:

**Disease $\rightarrow$ [[Impairment]] $\rightarrow$ [[Disability]] $\rightarrow$ [[Handicap]]**

*   **Impairment:** Loss/abnormality of psychological, physiological, or anatomical structure (e.g., Loss of foot).
*   **Disability:** Restriction or lack of ability to perform an activity in the manner considered normal (e.g., Cannot walk).
*   **Handicap:** Disadvantage resulting from impairment/disability that limits the fulfillment of a role (e.g., Unemployed).

> **Mnemonic for Sequence:** **D-I-D H**e? (Disease - Impairment - Disability - Handicap)

### Summary Table: Levels of Prevention

| Level | Phase of Disease | Aim | Modes of Intervention | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primordial** | Underlying conditions (Risk factors absent) | Prevent development of risk factors | Individual & Mass Education | Lifestyle modification in children to prevent future HTN. |
| **Primary** | Pre-pathogenesis (Risk factors present) | Prevent onset of disease | 1. Health Promotion<br>2. Specific Protection | Vaccines, Condoms, Helmets, Iodized salt. |
| **Secondary** | Pathogenesis (Early) | Halt progress, prevent complications | 1. Early Diagnosis<br>2. Treatment | Pap Smear, DOTS for TB, Screening for DM/HTN. |
| **Tertiary** | Pathogenesis (Late) | Reduce impairment, minimize suffering | 1. Disability Limitation<br>2. Rehabilitation | Physiotherapy for Polio, Crutches, Reconstructive surgery. |
