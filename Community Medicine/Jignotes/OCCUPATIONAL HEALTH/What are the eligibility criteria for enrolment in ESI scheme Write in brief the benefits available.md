### Clinical Relevance
Doctors working in industrial areas must be aware of the **Notifiable Occupational Diseases** under the Factories Act and ESI Act. If a worker presents with conditions like **Silicosis**, **Lead Poisoning**, or **Occupational Dermatitis**, they are entitled to Disablement Benefits. Accurate medical certification by the treating physician is crucial for the worker to claim Sickness and Disablement benefits.
