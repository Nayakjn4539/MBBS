# [[Autopsy]] > Model Autopsy Proforma External Examination Findings and interpretation

### Model Autopsy Proforma: External Examination Findings

The external examination is the most vital part of the [[medicolegal autopsy]] as it provides visual evidence of identity, time since death, and cause of death (trauma). It must be conducted systematically from head to toe.

#### 1. General Description and Identification
This section establishes the identity and physical state of the body.

*   **Physique and Nutrition:** Note if the body is emaciated, thin, medium, well-built, or obese.
*   **Stature and Weight:** Measure body length (crown to heel) and weight.
*   **Racial/Ethnic features:** Skin complexion, hair texture, facial features.
*   **Hair:** Color, length, texture, dyeing, or balding of scalp hair. Note beard/moustache status in males.
*   **Identification Marks:**
    *   **Scars:** Site, size, shape, and probable age.
    *   **Tattoos:** Design, site, color, and any name/initials (indicates identity or drug abuse masking).
    *   **Deformities/Amputations:** Congenital or acquired (old fractures, missing digits).
    *   **Occupational Marks:** Callosities on hands (manual labor), stains on fingers (dyes/chemicals).

#### 2. Examination of Clothing and Personal Effects
Clothing must be examined **before** removal.

*   **Condition:** Intact, torn, unbuttoned, or disarrayed.
    *   *Note:* Correlation of tears in clothes with injuries on the body (e.g., stab cuts, bullet holes).
*   **Stains:** [[Blood stains]] (direction of flow), seminal stains, mud, vomit, grease, or paint.
*   **Foreign Material:** Trace evidence like glass, paint flakes, or gunpowder residue (blackening/tattooing).
*   **Pockets:** Search for suicide notes, drugs, ID cards, or receipts.

**Medicolegal Aspect:**
In [[Firearm Injuries]], the clothing helps determine the range of fire (presence of scorching/blackening). In [[Sexual Offences]], stains and tears indicate struggle or non-consensual acts.

#### 3. Post-Mortem Changes (Estimating Time Since Death)
These findings help estimate the [[Postmortem Interval (PMI)]].

| Change | Observation to Record | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cooling ([[Algor Mortis]])** | Rectal temperature vs. ambient temperature. Feel skin (warm/cold). | Helps estimate TSD (approx. 0.4°C to 0.7°C drop/hour). |
| **[[Rigor Mortis]]** | Tested in jaw, neck, upper limbs, and lower limbs. | **Developing:** <12 hrs.<br>**Established:** 12–24 hrs.<br>**Passing off:** >24 hrs (variable by weather). |
| **[[Postmortem Lividity]]** | **Color:** Bluish-purple (normal), Cherry red (CO), Pink (Cold/Cyanide).<br>**Site:** Dependent parts.<br>**Fixation:** Does it blanch on pressure? | Indicates position of body after death and cause of death (e.g., [[Carbon Monoxide]] poisoning). Fixed lividity suggests death >6–8 hrs. |
| **[[Decomposition]]** | Greenish discoloration (RIF), marbling, skin slippage, bloating, purging. | Indicates late PMI. Marbling seen in 36–48 hours. |

**Mnemonic for Rigor Mortis order:** **"Nysten's Law"** — Starts from **Head** (eyelids/jaw) and moves **Down** to legs.

#### 4. Examination of Natural Orifices
*   **Eyes:**
    *   **Eyelids:** Open/closed; presence of petechiae.
    *   **Cornea:** Clear, hazy, or opaque (tache noire).
    *   **Pupils:** Size (dilated/constricted) and equality.
    *   **Conjunctiva:** Congestion, hemorrhage, or petechiae (common in [[Asphyxia]]).
*   **Nose and Mouth:**
    *   Presence of froth (white/fine = [[Drowning]]; blood-stained = pulmonary edema/poisoning).
    *   Foreign bodies (mud, weeds, gag).
    *   Position of tongue (protruded/bitten between teeth).
    *   Smell (alcohol, insecticides like kerosene/garlic).
*   **Ears:** Bleeding or CSF leak (indicates [[Basal Skull Fracture]]).
*   **Genitals and Anus:**
    *   Urethral/vaginal discharge, semen, or blood.
    *   Injuries to perineum (rape/sodomy).
    *   Fecal soiling/purging.

#### 5. Therapeutic/Medical Intervention
If the deceased was hospitalized, document:
*   Injection marks, IV cannulas (do not remove them).
*   Surgical incisions (sutured/unsutured).
*   Defibrillator paddle marks (mimics contusions).
*   Endotracheal tubes or drains.

#### 6. Description of Injuries
This is the most critical section for reconstruction of the crime. **All** injuries must be numbered and documented.

**Parameters to Record for Each Injury:**
1.  **Type:** [[Abrasion]], [[Contusion]], [[Laceration]], [[Incised Wound]], [[Stab Wound]], Firearm wound.
2.  **Site:** Exact anatomical location (distance from fixed landmarks like midline, heel, or nipple).
3.  **Size:** Length, breadth, and depth (in metric units).
4.  **Shape:** Linear, crescentic, irregular, circular.
5.  **Direction:** Vertical, horizontal, oblique.
6.  **Age of Injury:** Based on color changes (bruises) or scabbing (abrasions).
7.  **Nature:** Antemortem or Postmortem.

**Specific Injury Patterns:**
*   **Defence Wounds:** Cuts on palms/ulnar aspect of forearms (seen in homicide).
*   **Hesitation Cuts:** Multiple superficial parallel cuts on wrists/throat (seen in suicide).
*   **Patterned Injuries:** Tyre marks (RTA), ligature mark (hanging), muzzle impression (contact gunshot).

**> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Body Maps**
*Always indicate that injuries should be drawn on standard front and back body outline diagrams attached to the proforma for visual clarity.*

#### 7. Interpretation of External Findings

| Finding | Interpretation/Cause |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Petechial Hemorrhages** | Pinpoint bleeding on conjunctiva/face. Suggests **[[Mechanical Asphyxia]]** (throttling, strangulation) or coagulopathy. |
| **Washerwoman's Hands** | Wrinkled, sodden skin on hands/feet. Suggests prolonged immersion in liquid (**[[Drowning]]**). |
| **Cherry Red Lividity** | **[[Carbon Monoxide]]** poisoning or Cyanide poisoning (rarely cold exposure). |
| **Frog-like Posture** | Pugilistic attitude due to heat stiffening. Indicates **[[Thermal Burns]]**. |
| **Ligature Mark** | **Hanging:** Oblique, non-continuous, high up.<br>**Strangulation:** Transverse, continuous, low down. |
| **Froth at Mouth** | **Fine, white, tenacious:** Drowning.<br>**Coarse:** Pulmonary edema/Opium poisoning. |

### Summary of External Exam Proforma (Checklist)
1.  **Identity:** Sex, Age, Race, ID marks.
2.  **Thanatology:** Temp, Rigor, Lividity, Putrefaction.
3.  **Surface:** Clothes, Stains, Trace evidence.
4.  **Orifices:** Eyes (petechiae), Mouth (froth), Genitals (sexual assault).
5.  **Injuries:** Type, Size, Site, Antemortem character.
