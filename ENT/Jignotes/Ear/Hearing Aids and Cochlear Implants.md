# Hearing Aids

### Definition and Mechanism
A [[Hearing Aid]] is an electroacoustic device designed to amplify sound for an individual with hearing loss, making speech more intelligible and environmental sounds audible.

**Basic Components:**
1.  **Microphone:** Picks up acoustic sound waves and converts them into electrical signals.
2.  **Amplifier:** Increases the strength (voltage) of the electrical signal.
3.  **Receiver (Speaker):** Converts the amplified electrical signal back into sound waves and directs them into the ear canal.
4.  **Battery:** Power source.

**Modern Features:**
*   **Telecoil (T-coil):** Allows coupling with telephones or loop systems.
*   **Digital Signal Processing:** Converts signals to binary code, allowing precise tuning for specific frequency losses and noise reduction.

### Types of Hearing Aids

#### 1. Air Conduction Hearing Aids
These transmit amplified sound through the [[External Auditory Canal]] (EAC) to the [[Tympanic Membrane]].

| Type | Description | Indications/Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Body Worn** | Box worn on chest, cord connects to ear receiver. | Profound loss, manual dexterity issues. High power, minimal feedback. |
| **Behind-the-Ear (BTE)** | Components in a case behind pinna; tube connects to earmold. | Mild to profound loss. Rugged, suitable for children (mold can be changed as ear grows). |
| **Spectacle Type** | Components built into eyeglass frames. | Rare now; for patients needing vision and hearing correction. |
| **In-the-Ear (ITE)** | All components housed in the concha/earmold. | Mild to moderate loss. Cosmetic appeal, but electronics are exposed to wax/moisture. |
| **In-the-Canal (ITC)** | Smaller than ITE, fits in cartilaginous canal. | Cosmetic; requires good dexterity. |
| **Completely-in-Canal (CIC)** | Fits deep in bony canal; removed via pull-string. | Invisible, reduced wind noise, allows telephone use. Prone to feedback. |

#### 2. Bone Conduction Hearing Aids
These stimulate the [[Cochlea]] directly by vibrating the skull, bypassing the external and middle ear.

**Indications:**
*   **Active ear discharge** (chronic otitis media) where occluding the canal is contraindicated.
*   **Stenosis or Atresia** of the EAC.
*   **Conductive Hearing Loss** where surgery is not possible.

#### 3. CROS (Contralateral Routing of Signals)
*   **Indication:** Unilateral profound hearing loss (Single Sided Deafness) with one normal ear.
*   **Mechanism:** Microphone on the "bad" ear picks up sound and transmits it (wirelessly or wired) to a receiver on the "good" ear. It overcomes the "head shadow" effect.

# Implantable Hearing Devices

### 1. Bone Anchored Hearing Aid (BAHA)
A percutaneous or transcutaneous implantable device based on **osseointegration** (titanium bonding with bone).

**Components:**
1.  **Titanium Fixture:** Implanted into the skull (mastoid).
2.  **Abutment:** Connects fixture to the processor (percutaneous).
3.  **Sound Processor:** Detachable external unit.

**Mechanism:**
The processor detects sound $\rightarrow$ vibrates the skull $\rightarrow$ stimulates the cochlea directly (bone conduction).

**Indications:**
*   Congenital Aural Atresia/Microtia (bilateral or unilateral).
*   Chronically discharging ears (CSOM).
*   Single-sided deafness (transcranial transmission to the opposite cochlea).

**Clinical Implication:** Surgery for implantation is typically done after **5 years of age** to ensure sufficient skull thickness. Younger children use a Softband.

### 2. Active Middle Ear Implants (AMEI)
Devices that mechanically vibrate the ossicular chain (incus/stapes) or round window.
*   **Examples:** Vibrant Soundbridge, Esteem, Carina.
*   **Advantages:** Eliminates occlusion effect, feedback, and canal irritation seen in conventional aids.

# Cochlear Implants (CI)

### Definition
An electronic device that restores useful hearing in individuals with severe to profound [[Sensorineural Hearing Loss]] (SNHL) by bypassing damaged hair cells and directly stimulating the [[Auditory Nerve]].

### Components
> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Diagram showing external processor communicating with internal receiver and electrode array coiling into the cochlea

*   **External:**
    *   Microphone (picks up sound).
    *   Speech Processor (codes sound into digital signals).
    *   Transmitter Coil (sends signal via radio-frequency across skin).
*   **Internal:**
    *   Receiver/Stimulator (implanted under scalp).
    *   Electrode Array (inserted into the cochlea).

### Mechanism of Action
1.  Sound is captured and processed into digital code.
2.  Signal transmitted across skin to internal receiver.
3.  Receiver converts signal to electrical impulses.
4.  Electrodes in the **[[Scala Tympani]]** stimulate the spiral ganglion cells of the [[Cochlear Nerve]].
5.  Brain interprets signals as sound.

### Candidate Selection (Indications)
*   **Bilateral Severe to Profound SNHL** (>70–90 dB loss).
*   Little or no benefit from hearing aids (poor speech discrimination).
*   **Pre-lingual deafness:** Ideally implanted **before age 4** (optimal around 1 year) to utilize neural plasticity for speech development.
*   **Post-lingual deafness:** Adults who have lost hearing (memory of sound helps rehabilitation).
*   **Special Indications:**
    *   **Meningitis:** Urgent implantation needed before cochlear ossification occurs.
    *   **Mondini Dysplasia:** Can be implanted.
    *   **Auditory Neuropathy:** If hearing aids fail.

### Contraindications
*   **Michel Aplasia:** Complete absence of cochlea.
*   Absent or non-functional [[Cochlear Nerve]].
*   Central auditory pathway lesions.
*   Active middle ear infection.

### Surgical Procedure
1.  **Incision:** Post-aural.
2.  **Mastoidectomy:** Cortical mastoidectomy to identify antrum and incus.
3.  **Posterior Tympanotomy (Facial Recess approach):** Opening made between facial nerve and chorda tympani to access the middle ear.
4.  **Cochleostomy:** Opening made near the [[Round Window]] (or through it).
5.  **Insertion:** Electrode array inserted into the **Scala Tympani**.

### Complications
*   **Intraoperative:** Facial nerve injury, perilymph gusher, wrong placement.
*   **Postoperative:** Wound infection, device failure/extrusion, vertigo, tinnitus, taste disturbance (chorda tympani injury).

**Clinical Implication:** MRI is generally **contraindicated** or requires magnet removal/specific bandaging in patients with CI, as the internal magnet can displace or demagnetize.

# Auditory Brainstem Implant (ABI)

*   **Principle:** Bypasses the cochlea and auditory nerve to stimulate the **[[Cochlear Nucleus]]** in the brainstem directly.
*   **Indications:**
    *   **Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2)** with bilateral acoustic neuromas (where cochlear nerves are severed during tumor removal).
    *   Bilateral cochlear nerve aplasia.
*   **Placement:** Electrode paddle placed in the **lateral recess of the 4th ventricle**.
