# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > A 25-year-old person presented in OPD of a primary health centre with cough and fever for one-month, occasional blood-streaked sputum, and weight loss. Write down the diagnostic algorithm for the suspected disease as per the relevant national programme. Mention the treatment regimen for drug sensitive cases for adults.

### Diagnosis and Management of [[Pulmonary Tuberculosis]] under [[NTEP]]

Based on the clinical presentation (cough > 2 weeks, fever, hemoptysis, and weight loss), the 25-year-old patient is classified as a **Presumptive TB Case**. The management follows the guidelines of the **National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme ([[NTEP]])**.

### I. Diagnostic Algorithm for Pulmonary Tuberculosis

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Flowchart depicting the Diagnostic Algorithm for Pulmonary TB involving Presumptive TB case leading to Smear Examination/CXR and subsequent CBNAAT/Truenat testing to determine MTB presence and Rifampicin sensitivity

**Step 1: Identification**
The patient is identified as a **Presumptive TB case** based on the presence of any of the cardinal symptoms (Cough > 2 weeks, Fever > 2 weeks, Significant weight loss, Night sweats, or Hemoptysis).

**Step 2: Microbiological Confirmation**
*   **Preferred Method:** Upfront Molecular Diagnostic Test (Nucleic Acid Amplification Test - **[[NAAT]]**) like **[[CBNAAT]]** (GeneXpert) or **[[Truenat]]** is recommended for all presumptive cases to detect *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* and **Rifampicin resistance** simultaneously.
*   **Alternative:** **Sputum Smear Microscopy** (Ziehl-Neelsen staining or Fluorescence Microscopy). Two sputum samples (Spot-Spot or Spot-Morning) are collected.

**Step 3: Algorithm Flow**

1.  **Presumptive TB Patient** $\rightarrow$ Offer **HIV Counselling & Testing** + **Sputum Examination** (Smear/NAAT) + **CXR** (Chest X-ray).
2.  **Scenario A: Smear Positive OR CXR Suggestive of TB**
    *   Perform **[[CBNAAT]] / [[Truenat]]** immediately.
    *   **If MTB Detected:**
        *   Check **Rifampicin Sensitivity**:
            *   **Rifampicin Sensitive:** Treat as **Drug Sensitive TB ([[DSTB]])**.
            *   **Rifampicin Resistant:** Treat as **Drug Resistant TB ([[DR-TB]])** and send sample for Line Probe Assay ([[LPA]])/Culture to detect second-line drug resistance.
            *   **Rifampicin Indeterminate:** Repeat [[CBNAAT]] on a second sample.
3.  **Scenario B: Smear Negative AND CXR Non-suggestive**
    *   If clinical suspicion remains high, refer to a specialist or consider alternate diagnosis.
    *   If **Clinically Diagnosed TB** by a specialist $\rightarrow$ Start Treatment $\rightarrow$ Send sample for **[[CBNAAT]]**.

### II. Treatment Regimen for Drug Sensitive TB (Adults)

**Regimen Type:** Daily Fixed Dose Combination ([[FDC]]) Regimen.

**Clinical Relevance:**
*   **Rifampicin (R)**: Causes **Orange/Red discoloration of urine**. Warn the patient to avoid panic!
*   **Ethambutol (E)**: Can cause **Optic Neuritis**. Do not give to children who cannot report visual changes.
*   **Pyrazinamide (Z)**: Can cause hyperuricemia (joint pain).
*   **Isoniazid (H)**: Can cause peripheral neuropathy; **Pyridoxine (Vit B6)** is usually supplemented.

**Treatment Schedule:**

| Phase | Duration | Drugs Used | FDC Composition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Intensive Phase (IP)** | **2 Months** (56 doses) | **H R Z E** | **Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol** |
| **Continuation Phase (CP)** | **4 Months** (112 doses) | **H R E** | **Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Ethambutol** |

*Note: Pyrazinamide (Z) is stopped in the continuation phase.*

**Dosage based on Weight Bands (Adults)**:

| Weight Band | Number of Tablets (FDCs) per day |
| :--- | :--- |
| **25 – 39 kg** | 2 Tablets |
| **40 – 54 kg** | 3 Tablets |
| **55 – 69 kg** | 4 Tablets |
| **$\ge$ 70 kg** | 5 Tablets |

*   **Extension:** If the sputum smear is positive at the end of the Intensive Phase, do **NOT** extend the IP. Instead, send the sample for **[[CBNAAT]]** or **[[LPA]]** to check for drug resistance. If sensitive, continue to CP.

**Mnemonic for First-Line Drugs:** **RIPE**
*   **R** - **R**ifampicin
*   **I** - **I**soniazid
*   **P** - **P**yrazinamide
*   **E** - **E**thambutol
