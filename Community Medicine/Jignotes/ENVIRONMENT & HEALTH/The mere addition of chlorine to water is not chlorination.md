# [[ENVIRONMENT & HEALTH]] > The mere addition of chlorine to water is not chlorination

# The Principles of Chlorination

The statement "The mere addition of chlorine to water is not chlorination" implies that simply throwing chlorine into a water source does not guarantee disinfection. For chlorination to be effective and ensure potable water, specific **physio-chemical criteria** must be met. These are governed by the **Rules of Chlorination**.

### 1. The Rules of Chlorination

For chlorine to act as an effective [[germicide]], the following four conditions must be satisfied:

1.  **Water must be Clear:** The water should be free from **turbidity**. Suspended particles impede chlorination by shielding bacteria and absorbing chlorine.
2.  **Chlorine Demand must be met:** Water contains impurities (organic matter, ammonia, bacteria). Chlorine first reacts with and oxidizes these impurities. The amount of chlorine consumed in this process is called the [[Chlorine Demand]].
    *   *Formula:* **Chlorine Demand = Chlorine Added – Residual Chlorine**.
3.  **Contact Period:** There must be a contact period of at least **60 minutes (1 hour)** for the chlorine to kill bacteria and viruses effectively.
4.  **Free Residual Chlorine:** After the contact period, there must be a specific amount of free chlorine left in the water (0.5 mg/L) to protect against re-contamination during storage and distribution.

### 2. Mechanism of Action

When chlorine is added to water, it forms **Hydrochloric acid (HCl)** and **Hypochlorous acid (HOCl)**.

$$H_2O + Cl_2 \rightarrow HCl + HOCl$$

*   **[[Hypochlorous Acid (HOCl)]]:** This is the **principal disinfecting agent**. It is highly lethal to microbes (bactericidal).
*   **Hypochlorite Ion (OCl⁻):** HOCl further dissociates into Hydrogen ions and Hypochlorite ions. OCl⁻ is **70–80 times less effective** than HOCl.

> **Note on pH:** Chlorine acts best when the **pH is around 7**. If pH > 8.5, most HOCl dissociates into the less effective OCl⁻ ions, making disinfection unreliable.

### 3. Concept of Breakpoint Chlorination

[[Breakpoint Chlorination]] is the point at which the chlorine demand of the water is fully met.
*   Before this point, added chlorine is consumed by ammonia (forming chloramines) and organic matter.
*   **At the Breakpoint:** All impurities are oxidized, and chloramines are destroyed.
*   **Beyond the Breakpoint:** If further chlorine is added, it appears as **Free Residual Chlorine** (HOCl and OCl⁻).

### 4. Dosage Calculation

To ensure safety, the correct dose of chlorine is calculated as:

$$Correct Dose = Chlorine Demand + Free Residual Chlorine$$

### 5. Recommended Levels of Residual Chlorine

Different situations require different levels of Free Residual Chlorine (FRC) after a contact period of **1 hour**.

| Situation | Recommended FRC Level |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Normal Drinking Water** | **0.5 mg/L (0.5 ppm)** |
| **Post-Disaster / Epidemics** | **0.7 mg/L (0.7 ppm)** |
| **Swimming Pools** | **> 1.0 mg/L (1.0 ppm)** |

### 6. Measurement Tools

*   **[[Horrock's Apparatus]]:** Used to estimate the **Chlorine Demand** of water (specifically used for finding the dose of bleaching powder for wells).
*   **[[Orthotolidine Test (OT Test)]]:** Used to measure **Residual Chlorine** (Free and Combined).
*   **Chloroscope:** A device used to measure residual chlorine levels in drinking water.

### Mnemonics

**"C-D-C-R"** (To remember the 4 Rules of Chlorination)
*   **C** - **C**lear water (No turbidity)
*   **D** - **D**emand met (Chlorine demand)
*   **C** - **C**ontact period (1 Hour)
*   **R** - **R**esidual chlorine (0.5 mg/L)

### Clinical Relevance

*   **Limitations:** While chlorination kills pathogenic bacteria (e.g., *Vibrio cholerae*, *Salmonella typhi*), it has **no effect** on spores, protozoal cysts, and helminthic ova at standard doses.
*   **Viruses:** Polio and Viral Hepatitis A viruses are resistant to standard chlorination; they require **Superchlorination** or higher doses.
*   **Re-contamination:** The presence of *Free Residual Chlorine* is the only safeguard against cross-contamination (e.g., leaky pipes, suction) during the distribution of water.
