# [[Irritant Poisons (Inorganic)]] > Phosphorus

### Phosphorus

**Phosphorus** is a non-metallic irritant poison belonging to Group V of the periodic table. The name is derived from Greek words meaning *"light-bearing"*. It exists in two main allotropic forms: **White (or Yellow)** and **Red**.

#### Varieties and Properties

| Feature | White (Yellow) Phosphorus | Red Phosphorus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Appearance** | Translucent, waxy, crystalline cylinders | Reddish-brown, amorphous powder/solid |
| **Smell/Taste** | **Garlicky** odor and taste | Odorless and tasteless |
| **Luminosity** | **Luminous** (glows) in the dark (Phosphorescence) | Non-luminous |
| **Toxicity** | **Highly Toxic** [[Protoplasmic poison]] | **Non-toxic** (Inert and insoluble) |
| **Combustibility** | Catch fire spontaneously in air (kept under water) | Stable in air (ignites only at high temp) |
| **Solubility** | Soluble in oils, fats, and carbon disulfide | Insoluble |
| **Use** | Rodenticides, fertilizers, fireworks, military | Safety matchbox striking surface |

> **Note:** White phosphorus turns yellow on exposure to light, hence the names are used interchangeably. Red phosphorus is generally harmless unless contaminated with white phosphorus.

### Sources
1.  **Rodenticides/Insecticides:** Rat pastes (e.g., [[Zinc Phosphide]], Aluminium Phosphide).
2.  **Fireworks:** Very common source in India (crackers).
3.  **Fertilizers.**
4.  **Military:** Tracer bullets, smoke screens, incendiary bombs.
5.  **Matches:** Historically used in "Lucifer matches"; now banned. Red phosphorus is used on the friction surface of safety matchboxes.

### Mechanism of Action
*   **Local:** Causes severe irritation, corrosion, and deep burns upon contact.
*   **Systemic:** It is a **[[protoplasmic poison]]**. It disturbs cellular oxidation and metabolism.
*   **Target Organs:** It is highly **hepatotoxic** (toxic to the liver), causing fatty degeneration and necrosis. It also damages the heart (fatty changes), kidneys, and blood vessels.

### Clinical Features (Acute Poisoning)
Symptoms typically appear in **three distinct stages**:

#### 1. First Stage (Gastrointestinal Irritation)
*   Onset: Within a few minutes to hours.
*   **Garlicky taste** and odor in breath.
*   Severe burning pain in the throat, esophagus, and stomach.
*   Excessive thirst, nausea, and severe vomiting.
*   **Vomitus:** Dark, blood-stained (coffee ground), and **luminous** in the dark.
*   **Smoky Stool Syndrome:** Feces may emit fumes and glow in the dark.
*   Shock and collapse may occur.

#### 2. Second Stage (Latent Period)
*   If the patient survives the initial shock, there is a **symptom-free interval** (lull) lasting **2 to 3 days**.
*   The patient appears to improve, which can be clinically misleading.
*   However, histological damage to the liver continues during this phase.

#### 3. Third Stage (Systemic Toxicity)
*   Recurrence of symptoms with greater severity.
*   **Jaundice:** Indicating severe liver damage (Hepatocellular failure).
*   **Hepatomegaly:** Liver is enlarged and tender.
*   **Bleeding Diathesis:** Due to hypoprothrombinemia (liver damage). Petechiae, ecchymosis, hematemesis, epistaxis.
*   **Renal Failure:** Oliguria, albuminuria, hematuria.
*   **CNS:** Headache, delirium, convulsions, coma, and death (Hepatic encephalopathy).

### Fulminating Poisoning
In massive doses, death may occur within 12–24 hours due to peripheral vascular collapse (shock) and cardiac failure before jaundice appears.

### Chronic Poisoning ([[Phossy Jaw]])
Chronic exposure occurs mostly in industrial workers inhaling phosphorus fumes.
*   **Pathology:** Fumes enter through carious teeth/gums $\rightarrow$ Periostitis $\rightarrow$ Osteomyelitis $\rightarrow$ Necrosis of the jaw.
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Persistent toothache.
    *   Swelling of the jaw and loosening of teeth.
    *   Necrosis of gums and sequestration of the mandible.
    *   Formation of multiple sinuses discharging foul-smelling pus.
    *   This condition is termed **"Phossy Jaw"**, "Glass Jaw", or "Lucifer's Jaw".

### Fatal Dose and Fatal Period
*   **Fatal Dose:** 60 to 120 mg (approx. 1 mg/kg).
*   **Fatal Period:**
    *   Acute: 2 to 8 days (usually due to liver failure).
    *   Fulminant: 12 to 24 hours.

### Treatment
1.  **Decontamination:**
    *   **Gastric Lavage:** Use **1:5000 [[Potassium Permanganate]] (KMnO$_4$)**. It oxidizes phosphorus into harmless phosphoric acid and phosphates.
    *   **Chemical Antidote:** **Copper Sulfate (CuSO$_4$)** solution (0.2%). It coats phosphorus particles with insoluble **Copper Phosphide**. *Caution: Copper sulfate itself is toxic.*
2.  **Activated Charcoal:** To adsorb the poison.
3.  **Contraindication:** **Strictly AVOID OILS and FATS** (milk, ghee, butter, oil). Phosphorus is fat-soluble, and lipids accelerate absorption.
4.  **Cathartics:** Sodium/Magnesium sulfate to flush the bowel.
5.  **Systemic Support:**
    *   **Vitamin K** (IV) for coagulopathy/bleeding.
    *   High carbohydrate diet / IV Glucose (to protect the liver).
    *   Treatment for hepatic and renal failure (Dialysis if needed).
6.  **Skin Contact:** Wash with copious water; remove particles; apply Copper Sulfate solution.

### Autopsy Findings
*   **External:**
    *   **Jaundice** (yellow discoloration of skin and sclera).
    *   Subcutaneous hemorrhages/petechiae.
    *   **Garlicky odor** from the mouth/nose.
*   **Internal:**
    *   **Luminosity:** Gastric contents may glow in the dark (examine in a dark room).
    *   **Stomach:** Mucosa is congested, inflamed, thickened, and may be grayish/blackish. Erosions may be present. Contents smell of garlic.
    *   **Liver:** The most characteristic finding.
        *   Early: Enlarged, doughy, yellow, and greasy (**Fatty Degeneration**).
        *   Late: Shrunken (Acute Yellow Atrophy).
        *   Histology: Fatty infiltration, necrosis (periportal/focal).
    *   **Heart:** Flabby, pale, fatty degeneration.
    *   **Kidneys:** Fatty changes, tubular necrosis.

### Medicolegal Aspects
1.  **Accidental:** Most common. Often involves children eating fireworks or rat paste (bread with paste looks like jam/butter).
2.  **Suicidal:** Common in developing countries due to availability of rat poisons (Zinc phosphide).
3.  **Homicidal:** Rare due to strong taste and smell (garlic) and luminosity. However, historically used by mixing with strong-smelling substances (coffee/alcohol).
4.  **Aphrodisiac:** In very small doses, it was historically believed to be an aphrodisiac, leading to accidental poisoning.

### Mnemonic for Phosphorus Poisoning
**PHOS**
*   **P** - **P**rotoplasmic poison / **P**hossy Jaw.
*   **H** - **H**epatotoxic (Fatty liver) / **H**ypocalcemia.
*   **O** - **O**dor of Garlic / **O**ils contraindicated.
*   **S** - **S**moking Stool Syndrome / **S**hines (Luminous).
