# [[Abducens Nerve]] (CN VI) Palsy

The [[Abducens Nerve]] (CN VI) is the motor nerve responsible for innervating the [[Lateral Rectus]] muscle, which performs abduction of the eye. Paralysis of this nerve results in the inability to abduct the eye, leading to convergent strabismus and horizontal diplopia.

## Anatomical Course and Relationships
Understanding the course is vital for localizing the lesion.

### 1. Nuclear Complex
*   **Location:** Situated in the [[Pons]], ventral to the floor of the [[4th Ventricle]].
*   **Relations:** Closely related to the nucleus of the [[Facial Nerve]] (CN VII). Fibers of the facial nerve loop around the abducens nucleus (forming the facial colliculus) before exiting.
*   **Gaze Center:** The [[Paramedian Pontine Reticular Formation]] (PPRF), the center for horizontal conjugate gaze, is located near the abducens nucleus.
*   **Innervation:** Supplies the ipsilateral [[Lateral Rectus]].

### 2. Fascicular Part
*   Fibers pass ventrally through the pons.
*   **Exit:** Leaves the brainstem at the **pontomedullary junction**.
*   **Relations:** Passes adjacent to the pyramidal tract (corticospinal tract).

### 3. Basilar/Intracranial Part
*   Ascends the clivus.
*   **Dorello's Canal:** The nerve enters the cavernous sinus by passing through [[Dorello's Canal]] under the petroclinoid ligament.
*   **Clinical Significance:** This long intracranial course and the sharp bend over the petrous tip make it susceptible to raised [[Intracranial Pressure]] (ICP), rendering isolated VI nerve palsy a **False Localizing Sign**.

### 4. Intracavernous Part
*   **Location:** Runs **inside** the [[Cavernous Sinus]] (not in the lateral wall like CN III and IV).
*   **Relation:** It runs inferomedially, in close relation to the [[Internal Carotid Artery]] (ICA).
*   **Sympathetic Fibers:** Sympathetic fibers from the carotid plexus join the nerve briefly here.

### 5. Intraorbital Part
*   Enters the orbit through the **Superior Orbital Fissure** (within the [[Annulus of Zinn]]).
*   Innervates the [[Lateral Rectus]] muscle.

## Etiology

*   **Congenital:** Rare, may be due to aplasia/hypoplasia (e.g., [[Duane's Retraction Syndrome]]).
*   **Acquired:**
    *   **Vascular (Microvascular):** Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension (common in older adults; usually pupil sparing).
    *   **Trauma:** Head injury (fracture of the base of skull/petrous temporal bone).
    *   **Raised Intracranial Pressure (ICP):** Causes downward displacement of the brainstem, stretching the nerve over the petrous ridge (False Localizing Sign).
    *   **Tumors:** Pontine glioma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, cerebellopontine angle tumors.
    *   **Infections/Inflammation:** Gradenigo’s syndrome (Petrositis), Meningitis.
    *   **Aneurysm:** Compressive effect within the cavernous sinus.

## Clinical Features

The hallmark of VI nerve palsy is **defective abduction**.

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Position** | **Esotropia** (Convergent squint). The affected eye deviates medially due to the unopposed action of the [[Medial Rectus]]. |
| **Ocular Movement** | **Limitation of Abduction** on the affected side. |
| **Diplopia** | **Binocular Horizontal Diplopia**. It is **Uncrossed** (homonymous). The distance between images increases on looking towards the paralyzed side. |
| **Face Turn** | **Towards the side of the lesion**. (e.g., Right VI palsy $\rightarrow$ Face turn to Right). This minimizes diplopia by placing the eyes in a field of gaze where the lateral rectus is not required. |

### Clinical Implications of Nuclear vs. Nerve Lesions
*   **Nerve Lesion:** Causes isolated ipsilateral abduction deficit.
*   **Nuclear Lesion:** Causes ipsilateral **Horizontal Gaze Palsy**. This prevents the ipsilateral eye from abducting and the contralateral eye from adducting (via the [[Medial Longitudinal Fasciculus]]) towards the side of the lesion.

## Brainstem Syndromes Involving CN VI

Lesions in the pons often affect adjacent structures (CN VII, Pyramidal tract).

| Syndrome | Structures Involved | Clinical Presentation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Millard-Gubler Syndrome]]** | CN VI, CN VII, Pyramidal tract (Ventral Pons lesion) | • Ipsilateral VI palsy (Loss of abduction)<br>• Ipsilateral VII palsy (LMN Facial palsy)<br>• Contralateral Hemiplegia |
| **[[Foville's Syndrome]]** | CN VI Nucleus/PPRF, CN VII, Corticospinal tract (Dorsal Pons lesion) | • **Ipsilateral Horizontal Gaze Palsy** (Eyes look away from lesion)<br>• Ipsilateral VII palsy<br>• Contralateral Hemiplegia |
| **[[Mobius Syndrome]]** | Bilateral CN VI and CN VII nuclei (Congenital) | • Bilateral loss of abduction<br>• Bilateral facial weakness (Mask-like face) |
| **Raymond's Syndrome** | CN VI, Pyramidal tract | • Ipsilateral VI palsy<br>• Contralateral Hemiplegia (No facial palsy) |

## Examination and Diagnosis

### 1. Ocular Motility Testing
*   **Ductions and Versions:** Check range of motion. Limitation of abduction is diagnostic.
*   **Saccadic Velocity:** Slow saccades in abduction suggest a paretic cause rather than restrictive.

### 2. Diplopia Charting
*   Shows **Uncrossed Diplopia**.
*   Maximum separation of images occurs in the direction of the action of the paralyzed muscle (temporal gaze).

### 3. Hess Chart
*   Used to differentiate paretic vs. restrictive causes and monitor progress.
*   Shows shrinkage of the field on the affected side (lateral rectus) and overaction of the contralateral synergist (medial rectus).

### 4. Force Generation and Forced Duction Tests
*   **Forced Duction Test (FDT):** Used to distinguish palsy from restriction (e.g., thyroid eye disease or medial rectus entrapment). In palsy, the eye moves freely; in restriction, it does not.

### 5. Park's 3-Step Test
*   Used primarily for vertical diplopia (CN IV), not typically for isolated horizontal diplopia (CN VI).

## Management

### 1. General Principles
*   **Treat the Underlying Cause:** Control Diabetes/Hypertension, manage ICP, treat infections.
*   **Observation:** Microvascular palsies often resolve spontaneously within **3 to 6 months**.

### 2. Symptomatic Relief (Diplopia)
*   **Occlusion:** Patching one eye (usually the affected one) to eliminate diplopia.
*   **Prisms:** **Base-Out prisms** can be prescribed to fuse images in primary position if the deviation is small and stable.
*   **Botulinum Toxin (Botox):** Injection into the antagonist [[Medial Rectus]] to prevent contracture during the recovery phase.

### 3. Surgical Management
Indicated if no recovery after **6 months** and the deviation is stable.

*   **If some Lateral Rectus function remains:**
    *   **Resection** of the paretic Lateral Rectus (strengthening).
    *   **Recession** of the antagonist Medial Rectus (weakening).
*   **If Total Paralysis (No Lateral Rectus function):**
    *   **Muscle Transposition Procedures:** Vertical recti (Superior and Inferior Recti) are transposed to the insertion of the Lateral Rectus (e.g., **Jensen's procedure**, **Hummelsheim operation**). This provides abduction force.

### Mnemonics for Review

*   **LR6 SO4**: **L**ateral **R**ectus is **6**th Nerve, **S**uperior **O**blique is **4**th Nerve.
*   **3 Ps of Diabetic CN VI Palsy:** **P**ainful, **P**upil-sparing, **P**aresis (usually resolves).
*   **Millard-Gubler:** Think **M**edial (Pons) and **G** for **6** (VI) and **7** (VII) – *Note: G is the 7th letter of alphabet.*
