# Myositis Ossificans (Traumatic)

### Definition
**Myositis Ossificans** is a reactive lesion characterized by the formation of [[heterotopic bone]] (bone tissue in an abnormal location) within the muscle or other soft tissues.
*   **Terminology:** The term is a misnomer because the skeletal muscle is often not primarily involved (it occurs in the connective tissue), and true inflammation ("-itis") is rarely seen.
*   It is most commonly a complication of trauma, known as **Myositis Ossificans Traumatica**.

### Etiopathogenesis
The condition is usually triggered by a single severe blow or repetitive minor trauma to a muscle, causing a [[subperiosteal hematoma]].
1.  **Trauma:** Injury leads to bleeding within the soft tissues/muscle.
2.  **Hematoma Formation:** A collection of blood forms between the muscle and the bone.
3.  **Metaplasia:** Pluripotent mesenchymal cells within the hematoma differentiate into osteoblasts (bone-forming cells).
4.  **Ossification:** The hematoma gradually calcifies and ossifies, usually maturing from the periphery towards the center.

**Risk Factors:**
*   Severe trauma (e.g., [[supracondylar fracture]] of the humerus, [[posterior dislocation]] of the hip).
*   **Iatrogenic:** Vigorous massage or forceful passive stretching of a stiff joint after injury.
*   Delayed treatment of fractures.
*   Head injuries (associated with higher rates of heterotopic ossification).

### Common Sites
It typically affects large muscle groups adjacent to the bone.

| Region | Muscle Involved | Eponym/Association |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Elbow** (Most Common) | [[Brachialis]] | Associated with elbow dislocation or supracondylar fractures. |
| **Thigh** (Anterior) | [[Quadriceps]] | Common in contact sports (e.g., football). |
| **Thigh** (Medial) | [[Adductor muscles]] | **Prussian's Disease** (Historically seen in horse riders). |
| **Hip** | [[Gluteal muscles]] | Associated with hip dislocations or surgeries. |

### Pathology: The Zonal Phenomenon
The histological and radiological appearance varies by zones, which is crucial for distinguishing this benign condition from malignant bone tumors like [[osteosarcoma]].

*   **Peripheral Zone:** Mature, well-oriented lamellar bone.
*   **Intermediate Zone:** Immature osteoid and cartilage.
*   **Central Zone:** Highly cellular area with fibroblasts and hemorrhage (immature tissue).

**Clinical Implication:** In [[Osteosarcoma]], the pattern is reversed (the center is more mature/calcified, and the periphery is immature/aggressive).

### Clinical Features
The clinical presentation evolves over time:
1.  **Acute Phase (0–2 weeks):**
    *   History of trauma.
    *   Pain, swelling, and redness (often mistaken for an abscess or DVT).
    *   Local warmth and tenderness.
    *   **Pseudoparalysis:** Limitation of joint movement due to pain.
2.  **Subacute Phase (2–8 weeks):**
    *   Pain subsides gradually.
    *   Swelling becomes firmer and palpable as a distinct mass.
    *   Joint stiffness persists or worsens.
3.  **Chronic/Mature Phase (> 3–6 months):**
    *   Painless, hard bony mass is palpable.
    *   Mechanical block to joint movement (e.g., limited elbow flexion/extension).

### Investigations

#### 1. Radiography (X-Ray)
Findings evolve with the maturation of the lesion:
*   **Early (2–3 weeks):** Faint, fluffy, cloud-like calcification/opacities in the soft tissue.
*   **Intermediate (4–8 weeks):** Lacy pattern of new bone circumscribing the central clear area.
*   **Late (> 8 weeks):** Clearly defined bony mass with a mature cortex and trabecular pattern. It may or may not be attached to the underlying bone shaft.

#### 2. Serum Biochemistry
*   **[[Alkaline Phosphatase]] (ALP):** Raised during the active phase of bone formation.
*   **ESR/CRP:** May be elevated in the early inflammatory phase.

#### 3. Bone Scan
*   Shows increased uptake (hot spot) during the active phase (first 2–3 weeks), even before X-ray changes appear.
*   Activity decreases as the lesion matures.

### Differential Diagnosis
The most critical differential diagnosis is **[[Osteosarcoma]]** (malignant bone tumor).

| Feature | Myositis Ossificans | Osteosarcoma |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **History** | Trauma usually present | Trauma often incidental |
| **Pain** | Decreases with time | Increases with time (Night pain) |
| **X-ray Appearance** | Peripheral calcification (Egg-shell) | Central calcification/Sunburst |
| **Growth** | Stops after maturation | Progressive |
| **Histology** | **Zonal phenomenon** present | Zonal phenomenon absent |

### Treatment

#### 1. Prophylaxis (Preventive)
*   **Avoid Massage:** Massage is strictly prohibited after elbow injuries or muscle contusions.
*   **Gentle Handling:** Avoid forceful passive stretching during rehabilitation.
*   **NSAIDs:** **[[Indomethacin]]** is often used prophylactically in high-risk cases (e.g., hip arthroplasty) to inhibit osteogenesis.

#### 2. Conservative Management (Active Phase)
*   **Rest:** Immobilization of the affected limb in a functional position.
*   **Medication:** Analgesics and NSAIDs to reduce pain and inflammation.
*   **Physiotherapy:** Once the acute pain and redness subside (usually after 2–3 weeks), gentle **active** exercises are started.
    *   **Constraint:** Passive stretching is contraindicated as it exacerbates the condition.

#### 3. Surgical Management
Surgery is **contraindicated** in the active/immature phase because it invariably leads to recurrence (often more extensive than the original lesion).

*   **Indication:**
    *   Mature mass causing a mechanical block to joint motion.
    *   Nerve entrapment/compression.
*   **Timing:** Surgery is performed only after the mass is fully mature (usually **6–12 months** post-injury).
    *   **Maturity Indicators:** Normal [[Alkaline Phosphatase]], reduced activity on [[Bone scan]], and dense trabecular pattern on X-ray.
*   **Procedure:** Excision of the bony mass (Excision arthroplasty or soft tissue release).

### Complications
1.  **Joint Stiffness:** Permanent limitation of range of motion (e.g., stiff elbow).
2.  **Nerve Compression:** e.g., [[Ulnar nerve]] compression at the elbow.
3.  **Recurrence:** If excised too early.
