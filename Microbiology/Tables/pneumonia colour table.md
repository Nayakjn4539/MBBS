| **Typical Pneumonia** (Lobar Pneumonia) | Pyogenic organisms: **Streptococcus pneumoniae** (most common), **Haemophilus influenzae**, **Staphylococcus aureus**, Gram-negative bacilli (e.g., **Klebsiella pneumoniae**). | - | - | - | Infection of lung parenchyma (alveoli). **Pathogen Access**: 1. Aspiration from oropharynx (most common). 2. Inhalation of infected droplets. 3. Hematogenous spread (rare). 4. Contiguous extension (rare). The inflammatory response triggers clinical syndrome, releasing cytokines (**cytokine storm**) like IL-1, TNF, IL-8 causing tissue damage and alveolar capillary leak. | - | Characterized by **consolidation** radiologically, dull note on percussion, and **productive cough** with purulent sputum. Features include fever, chills, sweats, tachycardia, tachypnea, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain. | Sputum, induced sputum, tracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), protected specimen brush (PSB), lung aspirate, pleural fluid. | **Gram staining** for sputum quality check (pus cells >25, epithelial cells <10 per LPF) and presumptive identification of the etiological agent. | Sputum culture on blood agar, chocolate agar, and MacConkey agar.

| **Pneumococcal Pneumonia** | Streptococcus pneumoniae | Gram-positive, α-hemolytic, **lanceolate-shaped diplococci**. Possesses a polysaccharide capsule. | **Serotyping** based on capsular polysaccharide antigen (98 serotypes). Methods: **Quellung reaction**, latex agglutination test. | 1. **Capsular polysaccharide** (principal, antiphagocytic). 2. **C-carbohydrate antigen**. 3. **Pneumolysin**. 4. **Autolysin** (amidase). 5.
