# [[Diseases Of Vitreous]] > Vitreous Hemorrhage

### Vitreous Hemorrhage

**Vitreous Hemorrhage (VH)** is defined as the extravasation of blood into the [[vitreous body]]. It is a common cause of sudden painless loss of vision. The source of hemorrhage is usually the [[retinal vessels]] or new vessels (neovascularization).

### Etiology
The causes can be broadly classified into vascular, traumatic, inflammatory, and miscellaneous factors.

| Category | Causes | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Metabolic/Vascular** | **[[Diabetic Retinopathy]]** | **Most common cause in adults**. Bleeding occurs from neovascularization. |
| | [[Retinal Vein Occlusion]] (CRVO/BRVO) | Due to retinal ischemia and neovascularization. |
| | [[Hypertensive Retinopathy]] | Severe hypertension can cause vessel rupture. |
| **Traumatic** | **[[Blunt Trauma]]** | **Most common cause in young adults** (20–40 years). |
| | Perforating Injury | Direct damage to vessels. |
| **Inflammatory** | **[[Eales' Disease]]** | **Most common cause of recurrent vitreous hemorrhage** in young males. Characterized by periphlebitis and neovascularization. |
| | [[Uveitis]] | Erosion of vessels in acute chorioretinitis or pars planitis. |
| **Structural/Degenerative**| [[Posterior Vitreous Detachment]] (PVD) | Traction on retinal vessels; often associated with retinal tears. |
| | [[Retinal Detachment]] (RD) | Bleeding from a torn vessel bridging a retinal break. |
| **Blood Disorders** | [[Sickle Cell Retinopathy]] | Sea-fan neovascularization leads to bleed. |
| | Leupkemias/Anemia | Blood dyscrasias. |
| **Miscellaneous** | [[Terson Syndrome]] | Vitreous hemorrhage associated with **Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)** due to ruptured intracranial aneurysm. |
| | Tumors | Necrosis in [[Retinoblastoma]] or [[Malignant Melanoma]]. |

### Clinical Features

**Symptoms:**
*   **Small Hemorrhage:** Sudden appearance of [[floaters]] (black spots moving in front of the eye).
*   **Massive Hemorrhage:** Sudden, painless loss of vision (often described as hand movements or light perception).
*   **Photopsia:** Flashes of light may precede the bleed if caused by retinal traction or tear.

**Signs:**
*   **Distant Direct Ophthalmoscopy:**
    *   Small bleed: Black shadows against the red fundus glow.
    *   Massive bleed: Absence of red glow (black pupil).
*   **Slit Lamp Examination:**
    *   Presence of Red Blood Cells (RBCs) in the anterior vitreous.
*   **Fundoscopy:**
    *   Fundus details may be obscured.
    *   **Preretinal/Subhyaloid Hemorrhage:** Typically **boat-shaped**; blood remains unclotted and moves with gravity.
    *   **Intragel Hemorrhage:** Blood clots and moves bodily with the vitreous gel.
    *   **Old Hemorrhage:** Appears as white opaque condensation or yellowish-white debris.

### Investigations

1.  **[[B-Scan Ultrasonography]] (USG):**
    *   **Investigation of Choice** when the fundus is not visible due to opaque media.
    *   **Findings:**
        *   **Fresh Hemorrhage:** Scattered point-like echoes of varying amplitude.
        *   **Sedimented Blood:** Flat sheet of high-amplitude echoes.
        *   **Crucial Role:** To rule out [[Retinal Detachment]] (RD) and Intraocular Tumors behind the hemorrhage.
2.  **Indirect Ophthalmoscopy:** To look for retinal tears (especially superiorly) once blood settles.

### Complications (Sequelae)

If vitreous hemorrhage persists, it can lead to:
1.  **[[Ghost Cell Glaucoma]]:** Occurs in aphakic/pseudophakic eyes. Degenerated RBCs (Khaki colored ghost cells) block the trabecular meshwork ~2 weeks after bleed.
2.  **[[Haemolytic Glaucoma]]:** Trabecular meshwork blockage by macrophages laden with RBC debris.
3.  **[[Retinitis Proliferans]]:** Organization of hemorrhage leads to fibrovascular proliferation.
4.  **Tractional Retinal Detachment (TRD):** Fibrous bands contract and pull the retina.
5.  **[[Hemosiderosis Bulbi]]:** Iron toxicity to ocular structures.
6.  **Vitreous Liquefaction (Synchysis) & Degeneration**.

### Management

**Conservative Treatment:**
*   **Bed Rest & Head Elevation:** Allows gravity to settle the blood inferiorly, clearing the visual axis and permitting fundus examination.
*   **Observation:** Spontaneous absorption often occurs within 4–8 weeks.
*   **Treat Underlying Cause:** E.g., Laser photocoagulation for proliferative diabetic retinopathy or retinal tears once the view is clear.

**Surgical Management ([[Pars Plana Vitrectomy]]):**
*   **Indications for Surgery:**
    1.  **Non-resolving hemorrhage:** Persisting for **> 3 months**.
    2.  **Retinal Detachment:** If USG suggests associated RD, early surgery is required.
    3.  **Trauma:** Early intervention preferred in young patients or open globe injuries (after ~10 days to allow Posterior Vitreous Detachment to occur).
    4.  **Ghost Cell Glaucoma:** If medical management fails.
    5.  **Rubeosis Iridis:** To allow for Pan-Retinal Photocoagulation (PRP).

**Clinical Implications:**
*   In a diabetic patient, a sudden loss of vision is most commonly due to vitreous hemorrhage.
*   Always perform a **B-Scan USG** in cases of VH to ensure the retina is attached. If the retina is detached, it is a surgical emergency; if attached, one can wait for spontaneous absorption.
*   **Eales' Disease** should be suspected in a young adult male presenting with recurrent vitreous hemorrhage.
