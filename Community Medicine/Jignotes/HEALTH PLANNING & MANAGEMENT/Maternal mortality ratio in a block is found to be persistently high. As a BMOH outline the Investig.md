# [[HEALTH PLANNING & MANAGEMENT]] > Maternal mortality ratio in a block is found to be persistently high. As a BMOH outline the Investigation procedure to find out the causes and Intervention to be adopted to reduce the MMR.

### Investigation Procedure for High Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)

As a Block Medical Officer of Health (BMOH), the investigation must focus on the "Why" and "Where" the system failed. This is primarily done through **Maternal Death Review (MDR)**.

**1. Data Collection and Verification**
*   **Notification:** Ensure every maternal death (home or facility) is notified within 24 hours by the ANM/ASHA.
*   **Verbal Autopsy:** Conduct a [[Community Based Maternal Death Review]] (CBMDR). Visit the deceased's home to interview family members using a structured format (RHIME - Representative, Re-sampled, Routine Household Interview of Mortality with Medical Evaluation) to identify social and medical causes.
*   **Facility Audit:** Conduct a **Facility Based Maternal Death Review (FBMDR)** for deaths occurring in the hospital to identifying gaps in treatment, referral, or supplies.

**2. Identifying the "Three Delays"**
Analyze the data to pinpoint which delay contributed to the death:
*   **1st Delay:** Delay in deciding to seek care (Lack of awareness/decision making at home).
*   **2nd Delay:** Delay in reaching the health facility (Transport/Roads/Distance).
*   **3rd Delay:** Delay in receiving adequate treatment at the facility (Lack of drugs/blood/doctors).

**3. Medical Cause Analysis**
Categorize the death into Direct or Indirect obstetric causes:
*   **Direct:** [[Postpartum Hemorrhage]] (PPH), Sepsis, Hypertensive disorders (Eclampsia), Obstructed Labor, Unsafe Abortion.
*   **Indirect:** [[Anaemia]], Malaria, Heart disease, Hepatitis.

**4. Social Audit**
Investigate social determinants like early marriage (teenage pregnancy), high parity, short birth interval, and poverty.

### Interventions to Reduce MMR

Interventions must be targeted at the **"3 Es"**: **E**ssential obstetric care, **E**arly detection of complications, and **E**mergency services.

#### 1. Antenatal Care (ANC) Strengthening
*   **Early Registration:** Ensure 100% pregnancy registration within 12 weeks.
*   **Quality ANC:** Minimum 4 ANC visits (ideally more). Ensure measurement of BP, Weight, and Urine (Albumin/Sugar) at every visit.
*   **High Risk Pregnancy (HRP) Tracking:** "Name-based tracking" of HRPs (Severe anemia, Pre-eclampsia, previous CS, malpresentation) via the **Mother and Child Tracking System (MCTS)**.
*   **PMSMA:** Implement [[Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan]] on the 9th of every month for specialist review of high-risk cases.

#### 2. Nutrition and Anaemia Control
*   **IFA Supplementation:** Under [[Anemia Mukt Bharat]], ensure consumption of Iron and Folic Acid (IFA) tablets (100 mg elemental iron + 500 mcg folic acid) for at least 180 days.
*   **Deworming:** Administer Albendazole in the 2nd trimester.

#### 3. Intranatal Care (Safe Delivery)
*   **Institutional Delivery:** Promote 100% institutional deliveries using incentives from [[Janani Suraksha Yojana]] (JSY).
*   **Skilled Birth Attendance:** Ensure deliveries at home (if any) or sub-centers are conducted by **Skilled Birth Attendants (SBA)** who follow the "5 Cleans" (Clean hands, surface, blade, cord tie, cord stump).
*   **Partograph:** Enforce the use of a [[Partograph]] to monitor labor progress and detect obstruction early.
*   **LaQshya:** Implement **LaQshya** guidelines to improve the quality of care in labor rooms and maternity OTs.

#### 4. Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC)
*   **First Referral Units (FRUs):** Upgrade CHCs to **FRUs** with functional Operation Theatres, Blood Storage Units, and 24x7 availability of Gynecologists/Anesthetists.
*   **Referral Transport:** Ensure functional **102/108 Ambulance** services to reduce the "2nd Delay".
*   **Management of Complications:**
    *   **PPH:** Active Management of Third Stage of Labor (AMTSL) using Oxytocin/Misoprostol.
    *   **Eclampsia:** Availability of **Magnesium Sulfate** at PHC/CHC levels.

#### 5. Postnatal Care (PNC)
*   **48-Hour Stay:** Ensure mother and baby stay in the facility for 48 hours post-delivery for observation.
*   **Home Visits:** [[ASHA]] workers must conduct home visits (6 for institutional, 7 for home deliveries) under **Home Based Newborn Care (HBNC)** to check for maternal sepsis and bleeding.

#### 6. Social and Family Planning Measures
*   **Contraception:** Promote spacing methods (PPIUCD, Antara) to avoid "too early, too frequent, too many" pregnancies.
*   **JSSK:** Implement [[Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram]] to provide zero-expense delivery (free drugs, diet, diagnostics, and transport) to remove financial barriers.

### Clinical Relevance: The "4 P's" of PPH Management
*   **P**revent (AMTSL)
*   **P**harmacology (Oxytocin, Methergine, Misoprostol)
*   **P**rocedure (Bimanual compression, Balloon tamponade)
*   **P**roducts (Blood transfusion)
