# Laryngotracheal Trauma

Laryngotracheal trauma is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition due to the critical role of the larynx in airway protection, respiration, and phonation. Injuries can range from minor mucosal edema to devastating cartilaginous fractures and laryngotracheal separation.

## Etiology

The causes of laryngotracheal trauma are broadly classified based on the mechanism of injury:

### 1. External Trauma
*   **Blunt Trauma:** (Most Common)
    *   **Motor Vehicle Accidents:** The neck strikes the steering wheel or dashboard ("padded dash syndrome"). This is the most frequent cause.
    *   **Clothesline Injury:** The rider of a two-wheeler strikes a horizontal wire or cable at the neck level.
    *   **Sports Injuries:** Karate chops, hockey sticks, elbows, or balls striking the anterior neck.
    *   **Strangulation/Hanging:** Manual compression or ligature.
*   **Penetrating Trauma:**
    *   **Gunshot wounds:** Often associated with extensive soft tissue loss and comminuted fractures.
    *   **Stab wounds:** "Cut-throat" injuries (suicide attempts or assault). Knife blades often slide off the thyroid cartilage to injure the [[thyrohyoid membrane]] or [[cricothyroid membrane]].

### 2. Internal (Iatrogenic/Inhalational) Trauma
*   **Intubation Injury:** Prolonged endotracheal intubation, use of large tubes, or traumatic intubation (blind attempts).
*   **Surgical Trauma:** Complications of [[tracheostomy]], bronchoscopy, or laryngeal surgery.
*   **Chemical/Thermal:** Inhalation of toxic fumes, steam, or ingestion of corrosive substances (caustic burns).

## Pathophysiology and Biomechanics

The severity of injury depends on the age of the patient and the calcification status of the laryngeal framework.

*   **Pediatric/Young Adults (< 40 years):** Laryngeal cartilages are elastic and resilient. Upon impact, they compress against the cervical spine and spring back. This results in significant soft tissue damage (edema, hematoma, mucosal tears) often *without* fracture.
*   **Older Adults (> 40 years):** Cartilages are calcified and brittle. Impact leads to comminuted fractures ("shattered larynx") and displacement.

### Specific Injuries
*   **Hyoid Bone Fracture:** Rare; usually associated with strangulation.
*   **Thyroid Cartilage Fracture:** Can be vertical (midline) or transverse. May lead to avulsion of the [[epiglottis]] or anterior commissure disruption.
*   **Cricoid Cartilage Fracture:** Critical injury as the cricoid is the only complete ring maintaining airway patency.
*   **Laryngotracheal Separation:** The trachea is sheared off from the cricoid cartilage and retracts into the mediastinum (often fatal).
*   **Cricoarytenoid Joint Dislocation:** Leads to vocal cord immobility/fixation.

## Clinical Features

The clinical presentation varies based on the severity. The "Golden Rule" is that the severity of external signs does not always correlate with the severity of internal airway compromise.

### Symptoms
*   **Respiratory Distress:** [[Stridor]], dyspnea (may be immediate or delayed due to edema).
*   **Voice Change:** [[Dysphonia]], hoarseness, or aphonia (suggests vocal cord pathology or recurrent laryngeal nerve injury).
*   **Pain:** Tenderness over the larynx, [[odynophagia]], or pain on speaking.
*   **Hemoptysis:** Indicates mucosal tears.
*   **Cough:** Irritating cough.

### Signs
*   **Surgical Emphysema:** (Subcutaneous emphysema) A cardinal sign of airway breach. Air escapes into neck tissues causing crackling on palpation.
*   **Loss of Thyroid Prominence:** Flattening of the Adam’s apple (suggests thyroid cartilage fracture).
*   **Open Wounds:** Bubbling of air from neck wounds (sucking neck wound).
*   **Bony Crepitus:** Palpable grating of fractured cartilage fragments.
*   **Hematoma/Ecchymosis:** Bruising over the anterior neck ("seatbelt sign").

**Clinical Implication:** Even patients with minor symptoms should be observed for at least 24 hours, as laryngeal edema can progress rapidly and compromise the airway hours after the injury.

## Classification (Schaefer’s Classification)

This system is widely used to grade severity and guide management.

| Grade | Findings | Management Protocol |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Grade I** | Minor airway symptoms, minimal hematoma/edema, no fractures. | **Conservative:** Observation, humidification, steroids, antibiotics. |
| **Grade II** | Moderate edema/hematoma, minor mucosal disruption, non-displaced fracture. | **Conservative or Surgical:** Direct laryngoscopy, possible tracheostomy. |
| **Grade III** | Massive edema, large mucosal tears, exposed cartilage, displaced fractures, vocal cord immobility. | **Surgical:** Tracheostomy, exploration, and repair. |
| **Grade IV** | Same as G-III but more severe; comminuted fractures, unstable larynx. | **Surgical:** Tracheostomy, exploration, repair, stenting. |
| **Grade V** | Complete laryngotracheal separation. | **Surgical:** Immediate airway, extensive repair. |

## Diagnosis and Investigations

### 1. Airway Assessment (Primary Survey)
The priority is **ABC** (Airway, Breathing, Circulation). Assess for stridor and hypoxia.

### 2. Fiberoptic Laryngoscopy (Nasopharyngoscopy)
*   **Indication:** Stable patients with a secure airway.
*   **Findings:** Assesses vocal cord mobility, hematoma, edema, exposed cartilage, and mucosal tears.
*   **Caution:** Should be performed in an environment where an emergency airway can be secured immediately, as instrumentation may precipitate laryngospasm.

### 3. Computed Tomography (CT) Scan
*   **Indication:** Gold standard for stable patients.
*   **Utility:** Evaluates laryngeal framework fractures, cricoarytenoid dislocation, and paraglottic/pre-epiglottic space involvement. **3D reconstruction** helps in surgical planning.

### 4. Other Imaging
*   **Chest X-ray:** To rule out [[pneumothorax]] or pneumomediastinum.
*   **Cervical Spine X-ray:** To rule out associated C-spine fractures (common in blunt trauma).
*   **Esophagogram (Gastrografin swallow):** If esophageal injury is suspected.

## Management

### A. Airway Management (Immediate)
Securing the airway is the first priority.
1.  **Tracheostomy:** The **Gold Standard** and preferred method in severe laryngeal trauma. It bypasses the injury site and prevents further damage. usually performed under local anesthesia if the patient is awake and distressed.
2.  **Intubation:** Generally **discouraged** in severe trauma because:
    *   It may create a false passage.
    *   It can convert a partial obstruction into a complete one.
    *   It may displace fractured cartilages further.
    *   *Exception:* Can be attempted gently by an experienced anesthesiologist using a small tube if the injury is minor or visualization is good.
3.  **Cricothyroidotomy:** Generally contraindicated in laryngeal trauma because the cricoid may be fractured or the injury may be at the cricothyroid level.

### B. Medical Management (Conservative)
Indicated for Grade I and minor Grade II injuries.
*   **Observation:** In ICU/High dependency unit for 24-48 hours.
*   **Head Elevation:** To reduce edema.
*   **Voice Rest:** Essential to prevent strain.
*   **Humidification:** Moist air keeps secretions thin.
*   **Systemic Steroids:** (e.g., Dexamethasone/Hydrocortisone) To reduce mucosal edema and prevent fibrosis.
*   **Antibiotics:** To prevent [[perichondritis]] and infection of hematomas.
*   **Anti-reflux medication (PPIs):** To prevent acid irritation of the injured mucosa.

### C. Surgical Management
*   **Timing:** Ideally performed within **3–5 days** (once edema settles but before fibrosis sets in). Repair after 10-14 days yields poor functional results.
*   **Procedure:**
    *   **Approach:** Apron incision or collar incision.
    *   **Exploration:** [[Laryngofissure]] (midline thyrotomy) to inspect the interior.
    *   **Mucosal Repair:** Careful suturing of mucosal tears (using absorbable sutures like Vicryl) to cover exposed cartilage and prevent granulation tissue.
    *   **Fracture Reduction:** Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of thyroid/cricoid fractures using wires, non-absorbable sutures, or titanium mini-plates.
    *   **Stenting:** An endolaryngeal stent (e.g., [[Montgomery T-tube]] or silastic stent) is placed if there is:
        *   Anterior commissure disruption (to prevent webbing).
        *   Extensive mucosal loss.
        *   Comminuted fractures needing internal support.
        *   Stents are usually kept for 2–6 weeks.
    *   **Laryngotracheal Separation:** Immediate re-anastomosis is required.

## Complications

*   **Airway:** [[Laryngotracheal stenosis]] (subglottic stenosis is most difficult to treat), aspiration.
*   **Voice:** Chronic hoarseness, vocal cord palsy (RLN injury), cricoarytenoid joint fixation.
*   **Infection:** Perichondritis, laryngeal abscess.
*   **Others:** Pharyngocutaneous fistula, webbing (anterior commissure web).
