# [[Mechanical Injuries]] > skull Fractures

### Skull Fractures

A skull fracture is a break in the continuity of the skull bones. It indicates the application of significant force to the head, though severe [[brain injury]] can occur without a fracture, and conversely, a skull fracture can occur without significant brain damage.

The adult human head weighs about 4.5 kg. A linear fracture can be produced by a force of roughly 35 foot-pounds or dropping a weight of 2.25 kg from 1 foot.

### Mechanism of Production
Fractures are produced by two main mechanisms:
1.  **Local Deformation:** A weapon with a small striking surface (e.g., hammer) drives a piece of bone inward. The inner table stretches and fractures first, followed by the outer table.
2.  **General Deformation:** A blow with a broad surface (e.g., fall on the ground) flattens the skull. The skull compresses at the poles of impact and bulges at the equator. Fractures start at the periphery (outer table fractures first due to convexity) and extend towards the point of impact.

### Classification of Skull Fractures

#### 1. Fissured (Linear) Fracture
*   **Definition:** A linear crack in the bone involving the whole thickness or outer/inner table only.
*   **Cause:** Contact with a broad resisting surface (e.g., fall on the ground, traffic accidents).
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Most common type of skull fracture.
    *   Usually starts at the point of impact and runs parallel to the line of force.
    *   Tends to stop at bony buttresses (e.g., glabella, occipital protuberance) or sutures.
    *   **Medicolegal Importance:** About 20% are not detected on X-rays.

#### 2. Depressed Fracture
*   **Definition:** A fracture where a segment of bone is driven inwards into the cranial cavity.
*   **Cause:** Heavy weapon with a small striking surface (e.g., hammer, stone, stick, axe head).
*   **Fracture à la Signature (Signature Fracture):** The pattern/shape of the depressed fracture corresponds to the shape of the striking face of the weapon.
    *   *Example:* A circular depression from a hammer; a triangular depression from the corner of a brick.
*   **Mechanism:** Local deformation. The outer table is driven into the diploe; the inner table is fractured more extensively and irregularly.

#### 3. Comminuted Fracture
*   **Definition:** Bone is broken into multiple fragments (three or more pieces).
*   **Appearance:** "Spider’s web" or "Mosaic" appearance.
*   **Cause:** Significant force with a broad area of impact (e.g., heavy iron bar, crushing head injury).
*   **Sequence:** Fissured fractures may radiate from the center of comminution.

#### 4. Pond Fracture (Indented Fracture)
*   **Definition:** A simple dent or depression of the skull without a fracture of the inner table (fissuring may occur on the outer table).
*   **Occurrence:** Seen exclusively in **infants** due to the elasticity of the skull bones.
*   **Cause:** Obstetric forceps blade compression or forcible impact against a protruding object.
*   **Mnemonic:** *Pond* = **P**liable skull **O**f **N**ewborn **D**epression.

#### 5. Gutter Fracture
*   **Definition:** A channel or furrow cut into the thickness of the skull bone.
*   **Cause:** Glancing or oblique bullet wound ([[Firearm Injuries]]).

#### 6. Sutural (Diastatic) Fracture
*   **Definition:** Separation of the cranial sutures.
*   **Occurrence:** Usually in young adults/children before suture fusion.
*   **Cause:** Blow with a blunt weapon.

### Fractures of the Base of Skull
These are often caused by indirect violence (transmitted force) or "bursting" of the skull.

| Fracture Type | Description & Mechanism | Clinical Signs / Findings |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ring Fracture** | A fissured fracture encircling the foramen magnum. Separates the skull base from the spine. <br> **Mechanism:** <br> 1. Fall from height landing on feet/buttocks (force transmitted up the vertebral column).<br> 2. Heavy blow to the vertex forcing skull down onto the spine.<br> 3. Violent chin impact (driving mandible upwards). | Fatal. Usually associated with brainstem injury. |
| **Hinge Fracture** | **Motorcyclist's Fracture.** A transverse fracture across the base of the skull (usually middle cranial fossa), separating the base into two halves. <br> **Mechanism:** Heavy impact on the side of the head (lateral compression) or run-over accidents. | "Nodding Face" sign (abnormal mobility of the base). |
| **Anterior Fossa** | Involves cribriform plate or orbital roof. | **Black Eye** (Spectacle hematoma/Raccoon eyes): Subconjunctival hemorrhage.<br> **CSF Rhinorrhea:** Leakage of CSF through nose. |
| **Middle Fossa** | Involves petrous temporal bone. | **Battle's Sign:** Bruising over the mastoid process.<br> **CSF Otorrhea:** Leakage of CSF through ear. <br> **Facial Nerve Palsy.** |
| **Posterior Fossa** | Involves occipital bone. | Extravasation of blood in the nape of the neck. |

### Key Forensic Rules and Signs

#### Puppe's Rule (Sequence of Fractures)
Used to determine the chronological sequence of multiple blows to the head.
*   **The Rule:** A fracture line produced by a second blow will stop when it meets a fracture line produced by the first blow. It will not cross the pre-existing fracture line.
*   **Explanation:** The first fracture creates a discontinuity in the bone; energy from the second impact dissipates at this discontinuity.

#### Bevelling (In Firearm/Sharp Force)
*   **External Bevelling:** Seen on the outer table of the skull in **exit** wounds of bullets.
*   **Internal Bevelling:** Seen on the inner table of the skull in **entry** wounds of bullets.

### Autopsy Findings & Procedure
1.  **Inspection:** Before reflecting the scalp, feel for crepitus or depression.
2.  **Scalp Reflection:** Reflect the scalp completely to examine the periosteum. Blood infiltration into the edges of the fracture indicates an **Antemortem Fracture**.
3.  **Opening the Skull:**
    *   If a fracture is suspected, sawing should be done carefully to avoid extending the crack (artefact).
    *   Stripping the dura mater from the base is necessary to visualize basal fractures (especially hinge fractures).
4.  **Meningeal Hemorrhage:**
    *   Fracture of the temporal bone (pterion) often lacerates the [[Middle Meningeal Artery]], leading to **Extradural Hemorrhage (EDH)**.
5.  **Skull Tapping:** A "cracked pot sound" may be elicited on percussion if a fracture is present.

### Medicolegal Aspects
1.  **Nature of Injury:** Skull fractures are generally considered **Grievous Hurt** (endangers life/bone fracture).
2.  **Degree of Force:** Depressed fractures indicate specific, focused heavy force. Linear fractures indicate broad force.
3.  **Weapon Identification:** Signature fractures (depressed) can identify the striking surface of the weapon (e.g., hammer head).
4.  **Cause of Death:** Usually due to associated intracranial hemorrhage ([[Subdural Hemorrhage]], EDH), cerebral compression, or brainstem injury.
5.  **Artifacts:**
    *   **Heat Fractures:** In burnt bodies, skull fractures may occur due to heat. They typically radiate from a center, look like a spider's web, and the clot is not adherent (Heat hematoma).
    *   **Chisel Fractures:** Produced by the autopsy surgeon during forcible removal of the skull cap. They lack vital reaction (no blood infiltration).
