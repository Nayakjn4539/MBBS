# [[Osteoid Osteoma]]

### Overview
**[[Osteoid Osteoma]]** is a distinct, benign, bone-forming tumor characterized by a small central core of vascular osteoid tissue (the **[[Nidus]]**) surrounded by a zone of reactive **[[Bone Sclerosis]]**. It is the commonest true benign tumor of the bone.

### Epidemiology
*   **Age:** Predominantly affects children and young adults, commonly between **10 and 25 years** of age,,. It is rare below 5 years and above 40 years.
*   **Gender:** Males are affected more frequently than females (Ratio **2:1** or **3:1**),,.

### Anatomical Distribution
Can occur in any bone, but has specific predilections:
*   **Long Bones:** Approximately **50%** of cases occur in the **[[Femur]]** or **[[Tibia]]**.
*   **Site within Bone:**
    *   **[[Diaphysis]]** of long bones is the most common location,.
    *   **[[Metaphysis]]** (less cortical thickening seen compared to diaphyseal lesions).
    *   It is usually **cortical** (eccentric), but can be cancellous or subperiosteal.
*   **Spine:** Affects the **posterior elements** (pedicle, lamina, spinous process),. It is a common cause of painful **[[Scoliosis]]** in adolescents.

### Pathophysiology
*   **The Nidus:** The tumor itself is the nidus, which is small (usually **< 1.5 cm** or **< 2 cm** in diameter),.
*   **Pain Mechanism:** The nidus contains high levels of **[[Prostaglandin E2]]** (PGE2) and nerve fibers (axons), which are responsible for the intense pain.
*   **Reaction:** The host bone responds with intense reactive sclerosis (thickening) around the nidus.

### Clinical Features
1.  **Pain:**
    *   This is the leading symptom.
    *   **Nature:** Dull, aching, boring pain.
    *   **Timing:** Characteristically **worse at night**, often waking the patient from sleep,.
    *   **Aggravation:** May be aggravated by alcohol intake (vasodilation).
2.  **Aspirin Relief (Therapeutic Test):** The pain is dramatically relieved by **[[Aspirin]]** or **[[NSAIDs]]** (due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis). This response is almost pathognomonic,.
3.  **Swelling:** A bony hard, tender swelling may be palpable if the lesion is superficial (e.g., tibia),.
4.  **Deformity:**
    *   **Painful [[Scoliosis]]** (concavity on the side of the lesion) if the spine is involved.
    *   Limping if the lower limb is involved.
    *   Muscle wasting due to disuse.

### Diagnostic Imaging

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> X-ray showing a small radiolucent nidus surrounded by dense white cortical thickening/sclerosis in the diaphysis of a long bone

| Modality | Findings |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[X-ray]]** | • **Classic Triad:** Radiolucent **[[Nidus]]** (< 1-2 cm) + Central calcification (sometimes) + Dense surrounding **[[Sclerosis]]**,.<br>• In the diaphysis, the cortex is fusiformly thickened.<br>• Nidus may be obscured by severe sclerosis. |
| **[[CT Scan]]** | • **Investigation of Choice** for localization.<br>• Clearly demonstrates the nidus and the extent of sclerosis.<br>• Essential for planning surgical excision or ablation,. |
| **[[Bone Scan]]** | • Shows intense uptake (**"Hot Spot"**).<br>• **Double Density Sign:** Intense central uptake (nidus) with a surrounding area of lower uptake (sclerosis),.<br>• Highly sensitive; helps rule out multifocal disease. |
| **[[MRI]]** | • Shows extensive **[[Marrow Edema]]** and soft tissue edema.<br>• Can sometimes be misleading as the edema may mimic infection or malignancy, obscuring the tiny nidus,,. |

### Pathology (Biopsy)
*   **Gross:** The nidus is a small, red/cherry-red, granular, friable lesion distinct from the surrounding white sclerotic bone.
*   **Microscopic:**
    *   **Nidus:** Interlacing trabeculae of **[[Osteoid]]** and woven bone rimmed by **[[Osteoblasts]]**.
    *   **Stroma:** Highly vascularized connective tissue stroma (loose fibrovascular tissue),.
    *   **Surrounding:** Dense sclerotic lamellar bone.
    *   **No malignant potential**.

### Differential Diagnosis
1.  **[[Osteoblastoma]]**: Histologically similar but larger (> 2 cm), less sclerosis, less likely to respond to aspirin, and more common in the spine/sacrum,.
2.  **[[Brodie's Abscess]] (Subacute Osteomyelitis)**: Can look similar on X-ray (cavity with sclerosis) but usually has a channel (cloaca) and inflammatory signs,.
3.  **[[Stress Fracture]]**: Shows periosteal reaction and pain with activity, but the history usually suggests overuse.
4.  **[[Ewing's Sarcoma]]** (early stage): Cortical thickening and pain, but usually has permeative destruction.

**Table: Osteoid Osteoma vs. Osteoblastoma**

| Feature | **[[Osteoid Osteoma]]** | **[[Osteoblastoma]]** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Size** | Small (< 2 cm) | Large (> 2 cm) |
| **Pain** | Night pain, relieved by **[[Aspirin]]** | Dull ache, less responsive to Aspirin |
| **Reaction** | Intense reactive **[[Sclerosis]]** | Minimal sclerosis; expansile |
| **Site** | Diaphysis of Long Bones (Femur/Tibia) | Spine (Posterior elements), Sacrum |
| **Progression** | Self-limiting | Progressive growth |

### Treatment
The natural history is often self-limiting (burns out over years), but severe pain usually necessitates intervention.

#### 1. Medical Management (Conservative)
*   Indicated if pain is tolerable.
*   **[[NSAIDs]]** or **[[Salicylates]]** (Aspirin) for pain relief and to reduce inflammation.
*   Symptoms may resolve spontaneously over 2–5 years, but prolonged medication use has side effects,.

#### 2. Surgical and Interventional Management
Indicated for severe pain, failure of medical management, or spinal deformity.

*   **Percutaneous [[Radiofrequency Ablation]] (RFA):**
    *   **Treatment of Choice** currently,.
    *   Performed under CT guidance. A probe heats the nidus to 90°C for 6 minutes, destroying the tumor and nerve endings.
    *   Minimally invasive, performed as day-care surgery.

*   **Surgical Excision:**
    *   **En-bloc Excision:** Removal of the entire nidus with a rim of sclerotic bone,.
    *   **Burr-down technique:** Removing the sclerotic bone to expose and scoop out the nidus (curettage).
    *   *Note:* Incomplete removal of the nidus leads to **recurrence**.
    *   Specimen should be X-rayed immediately to confirm the nidus was removed.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Diagnosis Delay:** Often missed or diagnosed as "growing pains" or psychological pain due to lack of visible external signs initially.
*   **Spinal Lesions:** Always look for Osteoid Osteoma in an adolescent with painful **[[Scoliosis]]** and paravertebral spasm. The lesion is on the *concave* side of the curve.
*   **Aspirin Test:** A rapid relief of pain within 20-30 minutes of taking aspirin is highly suggestive of this diagnosis.
