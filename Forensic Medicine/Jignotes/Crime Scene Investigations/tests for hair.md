# [[Crime Scene Investigations]] > tests for hair

### Examination and Tests for Hair

Hair is a vital form of [[trace evidence]] found at crime scenes. It is resistant to putrefaction and can provide a wealth of information regarding identification, cause of injury, and poisoning.

### 1. Collection of Hair Samples
For valid forensic analysis, proper collection is crucial:
*   **Method:** Hairs should be **plucked** (not cut) using rubber-tipped forceps to ensure the **root** is intact (essential for [[nuclear DNA]] analysis).
*   **Quantity:** A minimum of **10 to 20** hairs should be collected to represent the range of variation. Some sources recommend up to 20-30 hairs.
*   **Site:** Representative samples should be taken from different areas (scalp, pubis, axilla).
*   **Packaging:** Store in folded paper packets or paper envelopes. Avoid glass tubes or tight sealing in plastic if moist, to prevent fungal growth.
*   **Control Samples:** Samples must be taken from the victim and the suspect for comparison.

### 2. Physical and Macroscopic Examination
Initial observation under good light helps in preliminary screening:
*   **Nature:** Whether it is hair or fiber (cotton, silk, nylon).
*   **Color:** Natural pigment vs. dyed hair. Dyed hair often shows a sharp line of demarcation near the root (new growth).
*   **Length and Texture:** Straight, wavy, curly, or woolly.
*   **Adhering Matter:** Presence of blood, semen, mud, or louse eggs (nits).

### 3. Microscopic Examination
This is the primary method for distinguishing human from animal hair and determining the site of origin.

#### A. Structure of Hair
1.  **Cuticle:** The outermost layer composed of scales (like roof tiles).
2.  **Cortex:** The middle layer containing pigment granules (gives hair its color).
3.  **Medulla:** The central core/canal.

#### B. Species Identification (Human vs. Animal)
This is determined primarily by the **Medullary Index** and the scale pattern.

**Medullary Index (MI)** = $\frac{\text{Diameter of Medulla}}{\text{Diameter of Hair Shaft}}$

| Feature | Human Hair | Animal Hair |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Medullary Index** | **< 0.3 (or 1/3)** | **> 0.5 (or 1/2)** |
| **Medulla Pattern** | Fragmented, interrupted, or absent. | Continuous, broad, and distinct. |
| **Cortex** | Thick (predominant part). | Thin. |
| **Cuticle Scales** | **Imbricate** (flattened, overlapping like fish scales). Margins are crenated. | **Coronal** (crown-like) or spinous. Very prominent. |
| **Pigment** | Distributed towards the periphery (cortex). | Distributed centrally or around the medulla. |

> **Mnemonic:** **H**umans have a **H**uge Cortex and **M**ini Medulla. **A**nimals have **A**mple Medulla.

#### C. Race Determination (Cross-section)
The shape of the hair in cross-section varies by race:
*   **Mongoloid (Asian):** Circular cross-section.
*   **Caucasoid (European):** Oval or elliptical cross-section.
*   **Negroid (African):** Flattened, reniform (kidney-shaped), or oval cross-section.

#### D. Determination of Body Site
*   **Scalp hair:** Long, tapering tip, circular/oval cross-section.
*   **Eyebrows/Lashes:** Short, stiff, curved, rapid tapering.
*   **Beard/Moustache:** Thick, coarse, triangular cross-section.
*   **Pubic/Axillary:** Coarse, wiry, curled, asymmetrical cross-section.
*   **Limb hair:** Short, fine, less pigment.

### 4. Determination of Sex
Sex cannot be determined from the hair shaft alone (morphologically). It requires cellular material from the **root sheath**.
*   **Barr Bodies:** Presence of chromatin body in the nuclei of root sheath cells indicates **Female**.
*   **Y-Chromosome:** Detection using fluorescent staining (quinacrine mustard) indicates **Male**.
*   **DNA Analysis:** Definitive sex determination via [[Amelogenin]] gene testing.

---

### 5. DNA Profiling
*   **Nuclear DNA:** Extracted from the **root/bulb** (follicular tag) of the hair. It is unique to the individual and used for **definitive identification** (STR analysis).
*   **Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA):** Extracted from the **shaft** (cortex) if the root is absent. It is maternally inherited (shared by mother, siblings). It cannot identify a specific individual uniquely but can exclude suspects or link maternal lineage.

### 6. Toxicological Analysis (Poisons and Drugs)
Hair acts as a "tape recorder" for chronic exposure to heavy metals and drugs because these substances deposit in the growing hair shaft and remain there.
*   **Sectional Analysis:** Since hair grows at approximately **1 cm/month** (or 0.4 mm/day), cutting hair into segments can reveal the *timeline* of exposure.
*   **Substances Detected:**
    *   **Heavy Metals:** [[Arsenic poisoning]], Thallium, Lead, Mercury, Antimony.
    *   **Drugs of Abuse:** Opioids, [[Cocaine]], Amphetamines, Barbiturates.
*   **Techniques:**
    *   **NAA** (Neutron Activation Analysis): Highly sensitive for metals (Arsenic).
    *   **AAS** (Atomic Absorption Spectrometry).
    *   Radioimmunoassay (RIA) for drugs.

> **Note:** External contamination (e.g., crack cocaine smoke) on the hair surface must be washed off before analysis to distinguish it from systemic ingestion.

### 7. Assessment of Injury/Trauma
The condition of the hair ends provides clues about the weapon or mode of injury:
*   **Sharp Weapon (Cut):** Clean, sharp, straight cut surface.
*   **Blunt Trauma (Crushed):** Split ends, irregular/ragged crushed appearance, splaying of fibers.
*   **Traction (Pulled):** Root sheath may be present, follicle tissue attached, bulb is irregular or deformed.
*   **Natural Fall:** Bulb is shrunken, club-shaped, and atrophied (Telogen phase).
*   **Fire/Burns:** **Singeing** (clubbing/swelling) of the hair tip, deposition of carbon particles, keratin fusion.

---

### 8. Serological Tests
*   **ABO Grouping:** Can be determined from the hair root using absorption-elution techniques (though DNA is now preferred).
*   **Precipitin Test:** Used to confirm the species origin (Human vs Animal) immunologically if microscopic features are inconclusive.
*   **Enzyme Analysis:** [[PGM]] (Phosphoglucomutase) typing from root sheaths.

### Medicolegal Importance
1.  **Identification:** Links a suspect to a victim or a suspect to a crime scene (Locard's Exchange Principle).
2.  **Nature of Crime:** Struggle is indicated by pulled hairs; sexual assault by pubic hair transfer.
3.  **Chronic Poisoning:** Best sample for proving chronic administration (e.g., Napoleon's arsenic poisoning).
4.  **Time Since Death:** Not very reliable, but loose hair suggests decomposition.
5.  **Weapon Identification:** Hair adherent to a weapon can link it to the victim.
