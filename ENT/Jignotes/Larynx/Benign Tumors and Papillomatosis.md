## Classification of Benign Laryngeal Lesions

Benign tumors of the [[larynx]] are divided into non-neoplastic tumor-like conditions and true neoplasms,.

| Category | Subtypes |

| **Non-Neoplastic (Solid)** | • [[Vocal Nodules]]<br>• [[Vocal Polyp]]<br>• [[Reinke's Edema]]<br>• [[Contact Ulcer]]/Granuloma<br>• [[Intubation Granuloma]]<br>• [[Leukoplakia]]/Keratosis<br>• [[Amyloid Tumors]] |
| **Non-Neoplastic (Cystic)** | • Ductal Cysts<br>• Saccular Cysts<br>• [[Laryngocele]] |

## Non-Neoplastic Solid Lesions

These lesions usually result from vocal trauma, infection, or degeneration rather than true neoplasia.

### 1. Vocal Nodules (Singer's or Screamer's Nodes)
*   **Etiology:** Result of vocal abuse or misuse (speaking in unnatural low tones or high intensities). Common in teachers, actors, vendors, pop singers, and talkative children,.
*   **Pathology:**
    *   Bilateral and symmetrical,.
    *   Located at the **junction of the anterior 1/3 and posterior 2/3** of the free edge of the [[vocal cords]] (Site of maximum vibration/trauma),.
    *   Size varies from a pinhead to half a pea.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Hoarseness** (cardinal symptom).
    *   Vocal fatigue.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Conservative (First line):** Voice rest, hydration, and [[Speech Therapy]] (to correct faulty voice production),.
    *   **Surgical:** [[Microlaryngoscopy]] (MLS) excision is done only for refractory or large nodules. Care is taken to preserve the vocal ligament,.

### 2. Vocal Polyp
*   **Etiology:** Sudden voice abuse (e.g., shouting), smoking, and allergy,.
*   **Pathology:**
    *   Usually **Unilateral**.
    *   Arises from [[Reinke's space]] (subepithelial space) due to hemorrhage and edema,.
    *   Can be sessile or pedunculated.
    *   Location: Same as nodules (junction of anterior 1/3 and posterior 2/3).
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Hoarseness.
    *   **Diplophonia** (double voice) due to different vibratory frequencies of the cords,.
    *   Large polyps may cause dyspnea or intermittent choking (flopping into the glottis).
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Surgical excision via [[Microlaryngoscopy]],.
    *   Post-operative speech therapy.

**Mnemonic for Nodules vs Polyps:**
*   **N**odules say **NO** to surgery initially (Voice rest first). They are like **Knees** (Bilateral).
*   **P**olyps **P**op out (Unilateral) and need **P**rocedure (Surgery).

### 3. Reinke's Edema (Bilateral Diffuse Polyposis)
*   **Etiology:** Chronic **smoking** and vocal abuse. Common in middle-aged women,.
*   **Pathology:** Collection of edema fluid in the subepithelial space of Reinke. Vocal cords appear as "pale watery bags of fluid",.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Low-pitched, husky voice**.
    *   Females may complain of a hypermasculine voice.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Cessation of smoking** is essential.
    *   [[Decortication]]/Stripping of vocal cords (one side at a time) or Reduction Glottoplasty,,.

### 4. Contact Ulcer / Granuloma
*   **Etiology:**
    *   Faulty voice production (hammering of vocal processes).
    *   **Gastroesophageal Reflux ([[GERD]]) / Laryngopharyngeal Reflux ([[LPR]])**,.
    *   Intubation trauma (Intubation granuloma).
*   **Site:** Posterior part of the larynx (Medial surface of **vocal process of arytenoids**),.
*   **Clinical Features:** Hoarseness, constant throat clearing, pain (worse on phonation),.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Anti-reflux therapy (PPIs).
    *   Voice therapy.
    *   Steroid injections.
    *   Surgery (Microlaryngoscopy) is the last resort due to high recurrence; **Botulinum toxin** may be injected to prevent recurrence,.

### 5. Leukoplakia / Keratosis
*   **Definition:** White plaque or warty growth on the vocal cord.
*   **Significance:** Considered a **Precancerous condition** (Carcinoma in situ often supervenes),.
*   **Treatment:** Stripping of vocal cords and histopathological examination.

## Cystic Lesions

### Laryngocele
*   **Definition:** Dilatation of the laryngeal saccule (appendix of the ventricle) filled with air,.
*   **Types:**
    1.  **Internal:** Confined to the larynx (distends false cord).
    2.  **External:** Herniates through the thyrohyoid membrane into the neck.
    3.  **Mixed:** Both components.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Hoarseness, cough, airway obstruction.
    *   External type presents as a reducible neck swelling that increases on coughing or Valsalva,.
    *   **Bryce’s Sign:** Gurgling/hissing sound produced on pressing the external swelling,.
*   **Treatment:** Surgical excision (external approach) or endoscopic marsupialization.

## Neoplastic Benign Tumors

### 1. Squamous Papilloma
This is the most common benign neoplasm of the larynx. It is divided into Juvenile and Adult types.

#### A. Juvenile Laryngeal Papillomatosis (Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis - RRP)
*   **Etiology:**
    *   Viral origin: **Human Papilloma Virus ([[HPV]]) types 6 and 11**,.
    *   Transmission: Usually vertical transmission from mother (genital warts) during vaginal delivery,.
*   **Pathology:**
    *   Multiple, glistening white/pink warty lesions,.
    *   Sites: True vocal cords (start), supraglottis, subglottis, trachea, and bronchi,.
    *   Common in children 2–5 years old.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Hoarseness** or aphonia.
    *   **Stridor** and respiratory distress (due to airway obstruction),.
*   **Diagnosis:** Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy followed by direct laryngoscopy and biopsy.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Surgery:** The mainstay is repeated debulking to maintain airway.
        *   **Microdebrider:** Gold standard (minimal trauma, precise),.
        *   [[CO2 Laser]].
    *   **Medical Adjuvants** (to reduce recurrence),:
        *   Interferon alpha-2a.
        *   Intralesional [[Cidofovir]].
        *   Indole-3-carbinol.
        *   Bevacizumab.
*   **Clinical Implication:** **Tracheostomy** should be avoided if possible as it promotes seeding of papillomas to the trachea and stoma site,.
*   **Prognosis:** High recurrence rate; spontaneous regression may occur after puberty. Malignant change is rare unless irradiated.

#### B. Adult Onset Papilloma
*   **Features:** Usually single, smaller, less aggressive,.
*   **Site:** Anterior half of vocal cord.
*   **Significance:** Does not regress spontaneously; may have **premalignant potential**.
*   **Treatment:** Surgical excision.

### 2. Chondroma
*   **Site:** Most commonly arises from the **Cricoid cartilage** (posterior plate),.
*   **Clinical:** Subglottic mass causing dyspnea or dysphagia.
*   **Diagnosis:** [[CT Scan]] shows extent; hard tumor on biopsy.
*   **Treatment:** Surgical excision.

### 3. Hemangioma
*   **Infantile (Capillary):**
    *   Site: **Subglottis**.
    *   Presentation: Biphasic **Stridor** in first 6 months of life,.
    *   Association: 50% have cutaneous hemangiomas.
    *   Treatment: **Propranolol** (first line), steroids, CO2 laser. Often involutes spontaneously by age 5,.
*   **Adult (Cavernous):**
    *   Site: Supraglottis/Vocal cord.
    *   Treatment: Excision or radiation if symptomatic (Laser not used for cavernous type),.
