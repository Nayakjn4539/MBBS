#### **1. Papilledema**
**Definition:** Passive swelling of the [[optic disc]] secondary to raised [[intracranial pressure]] (ICP),. It is almost always bilateral, though it may be asymmetrical,.

| Feature | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Etiopathogenesis** | **Mechanism:** Elevated ICP is transmitted through the subarachnoid space to the [[optic nerve]] sheath. This causes blockage of axoplasmic transport (stasis) in the prelaminar area, leading to axonal swelling and secondary vascular congestion,. <br> **Causes:** Intracranial tumors (ICSOL), meningitis, brain abscess, malignant hypertension, [[pseudotumor cerebri]] (Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension), and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis,. |
| **Clinical Features & Defects** | **Symptoms:** Usually asymptomatic early on; transient obscurations of vision (amaurosis fugax) lasting seconds (precipitated by posture changes); headache, projectile vomiting, and diplopia (CN VI palsy),. <br> **Fundus Signs:** <br> • *Early:* Blurring of disc margins (nasal first), loss of spontaneous venous pulsation,. <br> • *Established:* Paton’s lines (retinochoroidal folds), hyperemia, splinter hemorrhages, cotton wool spots,. <br> • *Chronic:* Champagne cork appearance. <br> **Visual Field Defect:** Enlargement of the [[blind spot]] initially; concentric constriction in late stages leading to tubular vision,. |
| **Treatment** | **Treat the Underlying Cause:** <br> • **Medical:** [[Acetazolamide]], weight loss (for IIH/Pseudotumor cerebri), diuretics,. <br> • **Surgical:** Ventriculoperitoneal shunt, optic nerve sheath fenestration (decompression) for progressive visual loss,. |

> **Clinical Implication:** **Foster Kennedy Syndrome** involves frontal lobe tumor causing ipsilateral [[optic atrophy]] (due to compression) and contralateral [[papilledema]] (due to raised ICP),.

#### **2. Optic Neuritis**
**Definition:** Inflammation of the [[optic nerve]]. It can be classified as **Papillitis** (disc swollen), **Retrobulbar Neuritis** (disc normal), or **Neuroretinitis** (disc edema + macular star),.

| Feature | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Etiopathogenesis** | **Demyelinating Disorders:** [[Multiple Sclerosis]] (most common), [[Neuromyelitis Optica]] (Devic’s disease), Schilder's disease,. <br> **Infectious:** Viral (Measles, Mumps), Syphilis, Tuberculosis, Lyme disease, Cat-scratch disease,. <br> **Autoimmune:** SLE, Sarcoidosis. <br> **Mechanism:** Inflammation leads to demyelination and conduction block. |
| **Clinical Features & Defects** | **Symptoms:** Sudden, unilateral profound loss of vision; pain on ocular movements; loss of color vision (red-green) and contrast sensitivity,. <br> **Signs:** <br> • **RAPD** (Marcus Gunn Pupil) is a hallmark,. <br> • **Uhthoff’s phenomenon:** Worsening of vision with rise in body temperature (e.g., exercise),. <br> • **Pulfrich phenomenon:** Altered perception of moving objects. <br> **Visual Field Defect:** [[Central scotoma]] is most common,. |
| **Treatment** | Based on **Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT)**,: <br> • **IV Methylprednisolone** (1g/day for 3 days) followed by oral prednisolone (11 days). <br> • **Note:** Oral steroids alone are contraindicated as they increase recurrence rate,. <br> • **Disease Modifying Agents:** Interferons for [[Multiple Sclerosis]]. |

**Mnemonic:** Features of Optic Neuritis – **A CUP MAP**
*   **A** - Acuity reduced
*   **C** - Color blindness / Central scotoma
*   **U** - Unilateral
*   **P** - Pain on movement / Pulfrich phenomenon
*   **M** - Marcus Gunn Pupil

*   **P** - Papillitis/Pyrexia (Uhthoff's)

#### **3. Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (AION)**

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Etiology** | [[Giant Cell Arteritis]] (Temporal Arteritis) – vasculitis of medium/large vessels,. | Hypoperfusion due to Hypertension, [[Diabetes Mellitus]], Nocturnal hypotension, Sleep apnea ("Disc at risk" - crowded disc),. |
| **Clinical Features** | Severe, sudden visual loss (often counting fingers/PL). Severe headache, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication,. | Sudden painless visual loss (often upon waking). Less severe than arteritic type,. |
| **Fundus** | Pale/Chalky white [[optic disc]] edema,. | Hyperemic disc edema. |
| **Field Defect** | Altitudinal field defect (usually inferior). | Altitudinal hemianopia (usually inferior). |
| **Treatment** | **Medical Emergency:** High dose systemic **Steroids** (IV Methylprednisolone) to save the other eye,. | No proven effective treatment. Control risk factors (BP, Diabetes, stop smoking). Aspirin may reduce stroke risk,. |

#### **4. Toxic and Nutritional Optic Neuropathy**
**Definition:** Damage to the papillomacular bundle due to exogenous toxins or nutritional deficiency,.

| Feature | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Etiopathogenesis** | **Causes (Mnemonic: DICE):** **D**igoxin, **I**soniazid, **C**hloroquine/Chloramphenicol, **E**thambutol,. <br> **Others:** Tobacco-Alcohol amblyopia (B12/Folate deficiency + Cyanide toxicity), Methanol poisoning (formic acid toxicity),. <br> **Mechanism:** Impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation affecting the papillomacular bundle. |
| **Clinical Features & Defects** | • Bilateral, symmetrical, painless, gradual progressive visual loss,. <br> • **Color Vision:** Dyschromatopsia (Blue-Yellow in early stages, Red-Green later),. <br> • **Fundus:** Normal initially or temporal pallor later. <br> **Visual Field Defect:** [[Centrocaecal scotoma]],. |
| **Treatment** | • **Remove the Agent:** Stop drug/tobacco/alcohol immediately. <br> • **Supplementation:** Hydroxocobalamin (Vit B12), Thiamine (B1), Folate,. <br> • **Methanol Specific:** IV Ethanol or Fomepizole, Hemodialysis, Correction of acidosis. |
