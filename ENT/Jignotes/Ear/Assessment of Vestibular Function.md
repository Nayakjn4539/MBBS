# [[Ear]] > Assessment of Vestibular Function

### Assessment of Vestibular Function

The assessment of the [[Vestibular System]] relies on a combination of detailed history, bedside clinical examination, and specialized laboratory investigations to differentiate between peripheral (inner ear/nerve) and central (brainstem/cerebellum) pathologies.

---

### 1. Clinical History: The "Dizzy" Patient
A focused history helps differentiate **Vertigo** (hallucination of movement) from **Disequilibrium** (imbalance) or **Presyncope**.

*   **Duration of Vertigo:**
    *   **Seconds:** [[Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo]] (BPPV).
    *   **Minutes to Hours:** [[Meniere's Disease]], Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA).
    *   **Days:** [[Vestibular Neuritis]], [[Labyrinthitis]], Stroke.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **Positional changes:** BPPV.
    *   **Loud Noise ([[Tullio Phenomenon]]):** Superior Semicircular Canal Dehiscence (SSCD), Perilymph fistula.
    *   **Pressure changes ([[Hennebert's Sign]]):** Fistula, Syphilis, Meniere's.
*   **Associated Symptoms:**
    *   **Hearing Loss/Tinnitus:** Suggests peripheral lesion (Meniere's, Labyrinthitis, Acoustic Neuroma).
    *   **Neurological Signs (Diplopia, Dysarthria, Ataxia):** Suggests central lesion.

---

### 2. Spontaneous Nystagmus
[[Nystagmus]] is an involuntary, rhythmic oscillation of the eyes.
*   **Direction:** Named by the **fast component** (cortical corrective phase).
*   **Alexander’s Law:** In peripheral lesions, nystagmus intensity increases when looking towards the fast phase (the healthy ear) and decreases when looking towards the slow phase (the affected ear).

**Table: Peripheral vs. Central Nystagmus**

| Feature | Peripheral (Labyrinth/VIII Nerve) | Central (Brainstem/Cerebellum) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Direction** | Unidirectional (fixed direction) | Multidirectional/Direction changing |
| **Type** | Horizontal with torsional component | Pure vertical, pure torsional, or pure horizontal |
| **Fixation** | Suppressed by optic fixation | Not suppressed (may enhance) |
| **Fatigability** | Fatiguable | Non-fatiguable |
| **Latency** | Present | Absent |
| **Vertigo** | Severe | Mild or absent |

### 3. Bedside Clinical Tests

#### A. Fistula Test
*   **Principle:** Inducing nystagmus/vertigo by pressure changes in the external auditory canal (EAC).
*   **Method:** Apply intermittent pressure on the tragus or use a [[Siegel’s Speculum]].
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   **Normal:** Negative (no reaction).
    *   **Positive:** Nystagmus/vertigo occurs. Seen in erosion of Horizontal SCC ([[Cholesteatoma]]), surgical fenestration, or round/oval window fistula.
    *   **False Negative:** Fistula present but covered by cholesteatoma matrix or dead labyrinth.
    *   **False Positive ([[Hennebert’s Sign]]):** Positive test *without* a fistula. Seen in **Congenital Syphilis** (hypermobile stapes) or **Meniere's Disease** (adhesions between utricle and stapes).

#### B. Romberg’s Test
*   **Method:** Patient stands feet together, arms crossed. Compare stability with eyes open vs. eyes closed.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   Swaying/Falling with **eyes closed**: Positive test. Suggests sensory ataxia (loss of proprioception) or uncompensated peripheral vestibular lesion (falls towards lesion side).
    *   **Sharpened Romberg:** Feet placed heel-to-toe (tandem). More sensitive for vestibular impairment.

#### C. Gait Tests
*   **Star Walk / Babinski-Weil Test:** Patient walks forward and backward with eyes closed. Peripheral lesions cause a star-shaped deviation pattern.
*   **Unterberger’s Stepping Test (Fukuda):** Patient marches in place (90 steps) with eyes closed and arms extended.
    *   **Positive:** Rotation > 45° towards the side of the lesion (hypoactive labyrinth).

#### D. Head Impulse Test (Halmagyi-Curthoys)
*   **Principle:** Tests the high-frequency [[Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex]] (VOR).
*   **Method:** Patient fixes gaze on examiner's nose. Examiner rapidly turns patient's head (10–15°) to one side.
*   **Normal:** Eyes stay fixed on target.
*   **Abnormal (Peripheral Lesion):** Eyes move with the head, followed by a corrective "catch-up" **saccade** to refixate on the target.
*   **Clinical Implication:** A positive HIT usually indicates a peripheral lesion (e.g., [[Vestibular Neuritis]]). A negative HIT in acute vertigo suggests a central cause (Stroke).

#### E. Positional Testing (Dix-Hallpike Manoeuvre)
*   **Indication:** Gold standard for diagnosing **Posterior Canal BPPV**.
*   **Method:**
    1.  Patient seated, head turned 45° to test ear.
    2.  Rapidly laid supine, head hanging 30° below table edge.
    3.  Observe for nystagmus (use Frenzel glasses if available).
*   **Findings in Posterior Canal BPPV:**
    *   **Latency:** 2–20 seconds.
    *   **Direction:** **Up-beating** and **Geotropic** (rotatory towards the ground/affected ear).
    *   **Duration:** < 1 minute.
    *   **Fatigability:** Disappears on repetition.
*   **Central Lesion Signs:** No latency, non-fatiguable, pure vertical nystagmus, direction changing.

> **Note:** For **Lateral Canal BPPV**, the **Supine Roll Test** (Pagnini-McClure) is used. Nystagmus is usually horizontal and geotropic.

### 4. Laboratory Investigations

#### A. Caloric Test (Fitzgerald-Hallpike)
*   **Principle:** Thermal stimulation of the **Lateral Semicircular Canal** by creating convection currents in the endolymph.
*   **Position:** Patient supine, head elevated 30° (brings lateral canal vertical).
*   **Stimulus:** Water irrigation at **30°C** (7° below body temp) and **44°C** (7° above body temp) for 40 seconds.
*   **Interpretation (Mnemonic: COWS):**
    *   **C**old water → Nystagmus to **O**pposite side.
    *   **W**arm water → Nystagmus to **S**ame side.
*   **Results:**
    1.  **Canal Paresis (CP):** Reduced response on one side (>20-25% difference). Seen in Meniere's, Acoustic Neuroma, Vestibular Neuritis.
    2.  **Directional Preponderance (DP):** Nystagmus beats stronger in one direction (>25-30% difference). Non-localizing but indicates asymmetry.
    3.  **Dead Labyrinth:** No response to 30°C/44°C. Confirm with Ice Cold Water (Modified Kobrak).

#### B. Electronystagmography (ENG) / Videonystagmography (VNG)
*   **ENG:** Uses corneal-retinal potential (cornea positive, retina negative) to record eye movements via electrodes.
*   **VNG:** Uses infrared cameras in goggles (more accurate, records torsional nystagmus).
*   **Uses:** Quantifies nystagmus, records caloric results, evaluates oculomotor functions (saccades, smooth pursuit, optokinetic).

#### C. Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials (VEMP)
Tests the **Otolith organs** (Utricle/Saccule) using loud sounds to evoke muscle reflexes.
1.  **Cervical VEMP (cVEMP):**
    *   Pathway: [[Saccule]] → **Inferior Vestibular Nerve** → Vestibulospinal tract → Sternocleidomastoid (SCM).
    *   Result: Inhibitory potential in ipsilateral SCM.
    *   **Clinical Use:** Tests Saccule/Inf. Vestibular nerve. **Threshold is lowered** (hypersensitive) in [[Superior Semicircular Canal Dehiscence]] (SSCD) and Tullio phenomenon.
2.  **Ocular VEMP (oVEMP):**
    *   Pathway: [[Utricle]] → **Superior Vestibular Nerve** → VOR → Contralateral Inferior Oblique muscle.
    *   **Clinical Use:** Tests Utricle/Sup. Vestibular nerve.

#### D. Electrocochleography (ECochG)
*   **Principle:** Measures electrical potentials of the cochlea (SP: Summating Potential) and auditory nerve (AP: Action Potential).
*   **Clinical Use:** Diagnosis of **Meniere's Disease**.
*   **Finding:** Enhanced SP/AP ratio (>30% or >0.45 depending on lab norms) indicates Endolymphatic Hydrops.

#### E. Posturography (Computerized Dynamic Posturography)
*   Assess functional balance by isolating sensory inputs (visual, vestibular, proprioceptive) using a moving platform and visual surround (sensory organization test).
*   **Use:** Monitoring rehabilitation, detecting malingering, assessing compensation.

#### F. Rotatory Chair Test
*   Stimulates both labyrinths simultaneously. Useful for bilateral vestibular weakness (where calorics might be inconclusive) and testing children.

### Mnemonics for Exam

*   **Caloric Test Direction:** **COWS** (Cold Opposite, Warm Same).
*   **HINTS Exam** (to rule out stroke in acute vestibular syndrome):
    *   **H**ead **I**mpulse: Normal (negative) in stroke.
    *   **N**ystagmus: Direction-changing/Vertical in stroke.
    *   **T**est of **S**kew: Vertical ocular misalignment (skew deviation) in stroke.
