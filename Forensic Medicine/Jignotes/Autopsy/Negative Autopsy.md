# [[Autopsy]] > Negative Autopsy

### Definition
A [[Negative Autopsy]] is defined as a post-mortem examination where the **cause of death cannot be ascertained** even after a detailed gross inspection, complete histological examination, and thorough toxicological analysis. 

It implies that despite meticulous dissection and ancillary investigations, no pathological lesion or chemical substance incompatible with life is found. 
*   **Incidence:** Approximately **2–5%** of all medico-legal autopsies turn out to be negative.

### Causes of Negative Autopsy
The reasons for a negative autopsy can be broadly classified into two categories: **Procedural Defects** (deficiencies in the examination) and **Obscure Causes** (conditions leaving no anatomical trace).

#### 1. Procedural Defects (Avoidable Causes)
These occur due to lack of skill, oversight, or insufficient resources.
*   **Inadequate History:** Failure to obtain police reports, hospital case sheets, or relatives' statements regarding pre-existing conditions (e.g., [[Epilepsy]], [[Asthma]]).
*   **Inadequate External Examination:** 
    *   Missing minute puncture marks (drug abuse, snake bite).
    *   Overlooking small electrical burns ([[Joule burn]]).
    *   Missing concealed trauma (e.g., in nostrils, hair).
*   **Inadequate Internal Examination:**
    *   Failure to demonstrate [[Pneumothorax]] or [[Air Embolism]] before opening cavities.
    *   Failure to examine neck structures (vagal inhibition).
    *   Not opening the coronary arteries or checking the posterior aspect of the heart.
*   **Insufficient Laboratory Analysis:** 
    *   Failure to preserve necessary viscera.
    *   Using wrong preservatives.
    *   Laboratory inability to detect specific plant poisons or newer synthetic drugs.
*   **Lack of Training:** Inexperience of the autopsy surgeon.

#### 2. Obscure Causes (True Negative Autopsy)
These are deaths caused by functional or biochemical failures that leave no gross or microscopic anatomical footprints.

| System/Category | Specific Conditions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Natural Causes** | • **[[Epilepsy]]:** Death in status epilepticus or post-epileptic state.<br>• **Cardiac:** [[Coronary artery spasm]], paroxysmal ventricular fibrillation, conduction defects.<br>• **Respiratory:** Dry drowning, spasmodic asthma. |
| **Biochemical/Metabolic** | • **[[Diabetes]]:** Hypoglycemia or diabetic coma (ketoacidosis).<br>• **Uraemia:** Renal failure.<br>• **Electrolyte Imbalance:** Hypokalemia, hyperkalemia. |
| **Endocrine** | • Adrenal insufficiency (Addisonian crisis).<br>• Thyrotoxicosis.<br>• Myxoedema. |
| **Concealed Trauma** | • **[[Concussion]]:** Brain concussion without structural damage.<br>• **[[Vagal Inhibition]]:** Reflex cardiac arrest due to stimulation of trigger areas (neck, genitals).<br>• **Commotio Cordis:** Blow to the chest causing arrhythmia. |
| **Poisoning** | • **Anesthetics:** Overdose or idiosyncrasy.<br>• **Plant Poisons:** Certain alkaloids which degrade quickly.<br>• **Neurotoxins:** Snake venom (neurotoxic) where bite mark is invisible. |
| **Miscellaneous** | • **[[Anaphylaxis]]:** Drug idiosyncrasy or allergic shock.<br>• **Psychological:** Severe emotion/fright. |

### Mnemonic
To remember the causes of a Negative Autopsy: **"HEALER"**

*   **H** - **H**istory inadequate / **H**ypoglycemia
*   **E** - **E**pilepsy / **E**lectrolyte imbalance
*   **A** - **A**naesthesia / **A**ir embolism (missed) / **A**llergy
*   **L** - **L**ab analysis insufficient
*   **E** - **E**xternal examination improper
*   **R** - **R**eflex Vagal Inhibition

### Protocol for Handling a Negative Autopsy
If gross findings are negative, the autopsy surgeon must proceed with the following steps before declaring the cause of death as undetermined:

1.  **Review History:** Re-interrogate the Investigating Officer (IO) and relatives regarding the deceased's medical history (fits, diabetes, heart condition).
2.  **Re-examine the Body:** Look closely for injection marks (axilla, web of fingers), electrical burns, or bite marks.
3.  **Visit the Scene:** Check for unconsumed medicines, suicide notes, or electrical appliances.
4.  **Ancillary Investigations:**
    *   **Histopathology:** Heart (for myocarditis), lungs, brain, kidneys, adrenals.
    *   **Toxicology:** Send routine viscera (stomach, liver, kidney, blood, urine).
    *   **Microbiology:** Blood culture/swabs if septicemia is suspected.
5.  **Specific Tests:**
    *   Vitreous humor analysis for glucose/ketones (diabetes), urea/creatinine (renal failure), and potassium (time since death).

### Medicolegal Opinion and Certification
*   **Avoid Ambiguity:** Do not use vague terms like "Cardiac Arrest", "Syncope", or "Heart Failure" as a cause of death; these are modes of dying, not causes.
*   **Opinion Format:** If all investigations (gross, histo, tox) are negative, the honest and correct opinion is:
    > "The cause of death could not be ascertained." 
    or
    > "Undetermined."
*   **Value of Negative Autopsy:** A negative autopsy is not a failure. It scientifically excludes unnatural causes like traumatic homicide, gross poisoning, or visible deadly weapons, which suggests (by exclusion) that the death was likely natural.
