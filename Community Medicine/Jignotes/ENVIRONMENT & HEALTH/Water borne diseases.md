# [[ENVIRONMENT & HEALTH]] > Water borne diseases

### **Water-Borne Diseases**

Diseases related to water are a major public health burden in developing countries. Strictly speaking, **Water-Borne Diseases** are those caused by the ingestion of water contaminated by human or animal excreta or urine containing pathogenic bacteria or viruses.

However, in public health practice, water-related diseases are often categorized based on their transmission mechanism.

### **1. Classification of Water-Borne Diseases (Biological)**
These are caused by the presence of an infective agent in the water.

| **Category** | **Diseases** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Viral** | • [[Viral Hepatitis A]] <br>• [[Viral Hepatitis E]] <br>• [[Orthopaedics/Jignotes/Pediatric Orthopaedics/Poliomyelitis]] <br>• [[Rotavirus]] diarrhoea |
| **Bacterial** | • [[Typhoid fever]] & Paratyphoid fever <br>• [[Cholera]] <br>• Bacillary dysentery ([[Shigellosis]]) <br>• [[Escherichia coli]] diarrhoea |
| **Protozoal** | • [[Community Medicine/Jignotes/COMMUNICABLE DISEASES/Amoebiasis]] (Entamoeba histolytica) <br>• [[Giardiasis]] (Giardia intestinalis) |
| **Helminthic** | • Roundworm ([[Ascariasis]]) <br>• Threadworm (Enterobius) <br>• Hydatid disease (Echinococcosis) |
| **Leptospiral** | • [[Weil's disease]] (Leptospirosis) |

> **Note on [[Leptospirosis]]:** While often water-borne, it is specifically acquired through contact with water contaminated by the urine of rodents (rats), entering through skin abrasions or mucosa.,,

### **2. Public Health Classification of Water-Related Diseases**
It is crucial to distinguish between diseases caused by *drinking* bad water versus diseases caused by *lack* of water or vectors *breeding* in water.

| **Type** | **Definition** | **Examples** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Water-borne** | Caused by drinking contaminated water (Faecal-oral route). | [[Typhoid]], [[Cholera]], [[Hepatitis A]] |
| **Water-washed** | Infections of the outer body surface due to **inadequate quantity** of water for personal hygiene. | [[Scabies]], [[Community Medicine/Jignotes/COMMUNICABLE DISEASES/Trachoma]], Conjunctivitis, Typhus |
| **Water-based** | Infections transmitted through an aquatic invertebrate animal (host). | [[Schistosomiasis]], [[Dracunculiasis]] (Guinea worm) |
| **Water-related** | Infections spread by insects (vectors) that breed in or near water. | [[Malaria]], [[Filariasis]], [[Dengue]], [[Yellow Fever]] |,,

### **3. Transmission Dynamics**
The primary mode of transmission for true water-borne diseases is the **Faecal-Oral Route**.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a flowchart showing the "F-Diagram" or Transmission Cycle. Feces -> Fluids/Fingers/Flies/Fields/Food -> New Host

*   **Source:** Human or animal excreta/urine.
*   **Channels:**
    1.  **Water:** Contaminated drinking water.
    2.  **Food:** Washed with contaminated water or handled by infected persons.
    3.  **Direct Contact:** Contaminated fingers.

### **4. Prevention and Control**
Community medicine aims to break the disease cycle at vulnerable points, primarily through the **[[Sanitation Barrier]]**.

1.  **Purification of Water:**
    *   Large scale: Storage, Filtration (Slow/Rapid sand filters), [[Chlorination]].
    *   Household scale: Boiling, Bleaching powder, Chlorine tablets, Filters.
2.  **Sanitary Disposal of Excreta:**
    *   Use of sanitary latrines to prevent soil and water pollution.
3.  **Food Hygiene:**
    *   Pasteurization of milk.
    *   Proper washing of vegetables.
4.  **Health Education:**
    *   Promoting hand washing.
    *   Avoidance of open defecation.

### **Mnemonic for Water-Borne Diseases**
**"P-H-A-R-M-acy C-T-S"** (Imagine getting drugs for these diseases at a pharmacy)

*   **P** - **P**olio
*   **H** - **H**epatitis A & E
*   **A** - **A**moebiasis / **A**scariasis
*   **R** - **R**otavirus
*   **C** - **C**holera
*   **T** - **T**yphoid
*   **S** - **S**higellosis

---

### **Clinical Relevance**
*   **Dehydration:** The major cause of death in water-borne diarrheal diseases (like [[Cholera]] and [[Rotavirus]]) is dehydration. The administration of **[[Oral Rehydration Solution]] (ORS)** is the life-saving intervention.
*   **Epidemics:** Water-borne diseases often present as **Common Source Epidemics** (explosive onset, clustering of cases) when a water supply is contaminated.
