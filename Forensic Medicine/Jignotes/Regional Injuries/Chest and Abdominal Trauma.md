# [[Regional Injuries]] > Chest and Abdominal Trauma

### Chest Injuries (Thoracic Trauma)

Injuries to the chest may be **non-penetrating (closed)** or **penetrating (open)**. Closed injuries are usually caused by blunt force (traffic accidents, falls, blows), while open injuries are caused by stabs, cuts, or projectiles.

#### 1. Rib Fractures
Fractures of the ribs are very common in blunt trauma.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **Direct Violence:** The bone fractures at the site of impact. The fragments are driven **inwards** and may injure the [[pleura]], lungs, or intercostal vessels.
    *   **Indirect Violence:** Produced by compression of the chest (e.g., run-over cases). The rib fractures at the point of maximum curvature (usually the angle). Fragments are forced **outwards**, rarely injuring internal organs.
*   **Common Sites:** The **5th to 9th ribs** are most commonly fractured.
    *   **1st and 2nd ribs:** Protected by the clavicle and muscles; fracture implies massive force.
    *   **11th and 12th ribs:** Floating ribs; mobile and rarely fractured.
*   **[[Flail Chest]]:** A clinical condition where a segment of the chest wall (usually involving multiple ribs fractured in two or more places) moves paradoxically during respiration (moves in during inspiration and out during expiration), leading to respiratory failure.
*   **Iatrogenic/Resuscitation Artefacts:** Fractures of the **3rd to 5th ribs** (and sometimes sternum) are common complications of vigorous external [[cardiac massage]] (CPR), especially in the elderly.

**Table: Differentiation of Rib Fractures**

| Feature | Direct Violence | Indirect Violence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Site of Fracture** | At the point of impact | At the point of maximum curvature (Angle) |
| **Displacement** | Inwards | Outwards |
| **Visceral Injury** | Common (Lungs, Pleura) | Rare |
| **Cause** | Blows, Stabs | Compression (Run-over, Crush) |

#### 2. Fracture of the Sternum
*   **Occurrence:** Relatively uncommon. Requires significant direct force (steering wheel impact) or indirect flexion/extension.
*   **Site:** Usually transverse fracture at the junction of the manubrium and body (Angle of Louis).
*   **Association:** Often associated with myocardial contusion or rupture of the aorta.

#### 3. Lung Injuries
*   **[[Contusion]] of Lung:** Bruising of lung parenchyma without laceration. Can occur directly under the impact or on the opposite side ([[Contrecoup injury]]).
*   **Laceration:** Caused by the sharp ends of fractured ribs penetrating the lung tissue or by penetrating weapons.
*   **Traumatic Cavitation:** Large irregular cavities formed by severe impact disrupting tissue.
*   **[[Pneumothorax]]:** Accumulation of air in the pleural cavity. Can be spontaneous (rupture of emphysematous bulla) or traumatic (puncture). **Tension pneumothorax** is life-threatening due to mediastinal shift.
    *   **Autopsy Demonstration:** Create a pocket of water between the skin and chest wall after reflecting skin; puncture the intercostal space underwater. Air bubbles indicate pneumothorax.
*   **Haemothorax:** Accumulation of blood in the pleural cavity due to rupture of intercostal vessels or lung parenchyma.
*   **Respirator Lung:** In victims maintained on ventilators after trauma, lungs show areas of collapse, hemorrhage, and **hyaline membrane** formation.

#### 4. Heart Injuries
*   **[[Commotio Cordis]] (Cardiac Concussion):** Sudden death due to a blunt non-penetrating blow to the precordium (e.g., baseball, hockey puck) without demonstrable structural damage to the heart. Death is due to **[[Ventricular Fibrillation]]** occurring during the repolarization phase (R-on-T phenomenon).
*   **Contusion:** Subepicardial or myocardial bruising.
*   **Rupture of Heart:**
    *   Common in severe crushing injuries.
    *   **Right Ventricle** is most commonly ruptured in blunt trauma due to its anterior position directly behind the sternum.
    *   Can lead to **[[Cardiac Tamponade]]** (accumulation of blood in the pericardial sac compressing the heart, preventing diastolic filling).
*   **Penetrating Wounds:** Stab wounds to the right ventricle bleed more profusely than the left due to thinner walls and lack of sealing by thick muscle.

#### 5. Aortic Rupture
*   Common in high-speed deceleration injuries (e.g., vehicular accidents, falls from height).
*   **Classic Site:** The **[[Aortic Isthmus]]** (just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery) is the most frequent site of rupture because the aorta is relatively fixed here by the ligamentum arteriosum, creating shear stress.

### Abdominal Trauma

**Important Feature:** The anterior abdominal wall is highly elastic. Severe life-threatening internal injuries (rupture of liver/spleen) can occur **without any visible external marks** of injury on the skin.

#### 1. Liver
*   **Incidence:** It is the **most frequently damaged** abdominal organ in blunt trauma.
*   **Types of Injury:**
    *   **Transcapsular lacerations:** Tears through the capsule and parenchyma.
    *   **Subcapsular hematoma:** Bleeding beneath the capsule.
    *   **Bursting injuries:** Extensive disruption due to compression.
*   **Artefacts:** Rough handling during autopsy (pulling the liver) can cause tears at the attachment of the diaphragm, simulating ante-mortem lacerations.

#### 2. Spleen
*   **Vulnerability:** Highly friable and vascular. Commonly injured by kicks or falls on the left flank.
*   **Pathological Rupture:** An enlarged, diseased spleen (Malaria, Leukemia, Typhoid) can rupture with minimal/trivial force which would not damage a normal spleen.
*   **Delayed Rupture:** Bleeding may initially be contained by the capsule (subcapsular hematoma). Rupture into the peritoneal cavity may occur hours or days later (Delayed/Secondary rupture).

#### 3. Gastrointestinal Tract
*   **Stomach:** Rupture is rare unless the stomach is full/distended.
*   **Intestines:**
    *   **Duodenum/Jejunum:** Often transected or torn at fixed points (e.g., Ligament of Treitz) during deceleration.
    *   **Mesentery:** Tears in the mesentery can cause severe internal hemorrhage and ischemic necrosis of the bowel segment.
    *   **Blast Injury:** Air-filled organs like intestines are highly susceptible to primary blast waves (perforation).

#### 4. Kidneys
*   Injured by crushing force against the vertebral column or 12th rib.
*   Presents with **[[Haematuria]]**.
*   **Perinephric Hematoma:** Blood collection around the kidney.

#### 5. Urinary Bladder
*   Rupture occurs if the bladder is **distended** at the time of impact.
*   Often associated with **[[Pelvic Fractures]]**.
*   Can be intraperitoneal (dome rupture) or extraperitoneal.

### Medicolegal Aspects & Autopsy Findings

*   **Cause of Death:** Usually **Hemorrhagic Shock** (internal bleeding), **Traumatic Asphyxia** (chest compression), or **Septicemia/Peritonitis** (delayed death from bowel rupture).
*   **Voluntary Acts:** A person may still be capable of movement (walking, speaking) for a short period after receiving a fatal heart or abdominal injury (e.g., stab wound) before collapsing.
*   **Post-Mortem Findings:**
    *   **Pale organs:** Due to massive internal hemorrhage.
    *   **Fluid blood:** In the abdominal cavity (Hemoperitoneum) or chest (Hemothorax).
    *   **Retroperitoneal Hemorrhage:** Check for bruising around the pancreas and kidneys.

### Mnemonics

*   **B-L-A-S-T** (For injuries in explosions affecting chest/abdomen):
    *   **B**last lung (hemorrhage/edema)
    *   **L**iver laceration
    *   **A**uditory (eardrum rupture - though head)
    *   **S**pleen rupture
    *   **T**ract (GI) perforation

*   **CPR Artifacts:** Think **"3-4-5"**: Fractures of ribs **3, 4, and 5** are most common during CPR.
