# Hallux Valgus (Bunion)

### Definition
[[Hallux valgus]] is a complex deformity of the forefoot characterized by the lateral deviation of the [[great toe]] (hallux) at the [[metatarsophalangeal joint]] (MTP joint) and the medial deviation of the first [[metatarsal bone]] (metatarsus primus varus).

*   **Bunion:** This refers specifically to the adventitious bursa that forms over the prominent medial aspect of the first metatarsal head due to friction and pressure.

### Etiology and Risk Factors
The condition is multifactorial, often described as a disease of modern footwear superimposed on predisposing anatomy.

1.  **Extrinsic Factors:**
    *   **Footwear:** The most common cause. Wearing pointed shoes with high heels forces the toes into a triangular space, deviating the hallux laterally.
    *   **Incidence:** It is rare in populations who do not wear shoes, where the foot retains a fan-shape with the big toe in line with the first metatarsal.

2.  **Intrinsic Factors:**
    *   **Genetics:** Positive family history is common.
    *   **Anatomical Predisposition:** Long first metatarsal, rounded metatarsal head.
    *   **Systemic Disease:** [[Rheumatoid arthritis]] (common cause of severe deformity), ligamentous laxity.
    *   **Neuromuscular disorders:** Cerebral palsy, stroke.

### Pathoanatomy
The deformity involves a sequence of structural failures:
*   **Ligamentous Imbalance:** Stretching of the medial capsule and collateral ligaments, with simultaneous contracture of the lateral capsule and ligaments.
*   **Metatarsus Primus Varus:** The first metatarsal deviates medially away from the second metatarsal.
*   **Bunion Formation:** The medial end of the first metatarsal head hypertrophies (exostosis). An adventitious bursa develops over this prominence due to friction against footwear.
*   **Tendon Displacement:** The [[extensor hallucis longus]] (EHL) tendon is displaced laterally into the intermetatarsal space. It then acts like a **bowstring**, furthering the valgus deformity.
*   **Sesamoid Shift:** The [[sesamoid bones]] shift laterally relative to the metatarsal head.

### Clinical Features
Patients are predominantly female (female:male ratio approx. 15:1), often presenting in middle age.

**Symptoms:**
*   **Pain:** Primarily over the **bunion** (medial eminence) due to shoe pressure.
*   **Metatarsalgia:** Pain under the lesser metatarsal heads due to transfer of weight-bearing responsibility from the great toe to the lateral toes.
*   **Cosmetic concern:** Difficulty fitting into fashionable shoes.

**Signs:**
*   **Deformity:** Lateral deviation of the big toe and medial prominence of the metatarsal head.
*   **Bunion:** The skin over the prominence may be red, tender, or show signs of ulceration/infection.
*   **Overriding Toes:** The great toe may underride or override the second toe.
*   **Secondary Deformities:** [[Hammer toe]] or [[claw toe]] of the second digit due to crowding.
*   **Callosities:** Often found on the medial aspect of the great toe or under the 2nd/3rd metatarsal heads.

> **Clinical Implication:** Always assess the neurovascular status. In diabetic patients, a bunion can be a site of severe ulceration and osteomyelitis due to pressure necrosis.

### Radiological Assessment
> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> AP X-ray of the foot measuring Hallux Valgus angle and Intermetatarsal angle

Standard weight-bearing AP and Lateral X-rays are required.

| Angle | Normal Value | Significance in Hallux Valgus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hallux Valgus Angle (HVA)** | < 15° | Angle between the axis of the first metatarsal and the proximal phalanx. >15° indicates deformity. |
| **Intermetatarsal Angle (IMA)** | < 9° | Angle between the axes of the first and second metatarsals. Increases in hallux valgus (Metatarsus primus varus). |

*   **Joint Congruity:** Check for subluxation of the MTP joint.
*   **Degeneration:** Look for osteophytes or joint space narrowing indicating secondary [[osteoarthritis]].

### Differential Diagnosis
*   **[[Gout]]:** Acute inflammation of the 1st MTP joint (Podagra). Differentiated by acute onset, severe tenderness, and elevated uric acid.
*   **[[Hallux Rigidus]]:** Stiffness of the big toe due to OA, without significant valgus deformity.
*   **Infection:** Septic bursitis.

### Management

#### 1. Conservative Treatment
This is the first line of management, especially for mild deformities or patients unfit for surgery.
*   **Footwear modification:** Wide toe-box shoes, avoiding high heels.
*   **Orthotics:** Toe spacers, bunion pads (to relieve pressure on the exostosis).
*   **Analgesics:** NSAIDs for acute inflammatory episodes.

#### 2. Surgical Treatment
Surgery is indicated for pain affecting daily activities or difficulty fitting shoes, *not* purely for cosmetics.

**Principles of Surgery:**
1.  Correction of valgus deformity of the toe.
2.  Correction of varus deformity of the metatarsal.
3.  Excision of the bunion (Exostosis).
4.  Rebalancing soft tissues.

**Common Procedures:**

| Procedure Name | Description | Indication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Mitchell's Osteotomy]]** | Double step-cut osteotomy at the **neck** of the 1st metatarsal to displace the head laterally. | Moderate to severe deformity in young/active patients. |
| **[[Keller's Arthroplasty]]** | Excision of the **base of the proximal phalanx** (approx. 1/3 to 1/2) + Exostectomy. | Elderly patients with low functional demand or associated OA. (Creates a "floppy toe"). |
| **[[Mayo's Operation]]** | Excision of the **head** of the 1st metatarsal. | Similar to Keller's; less commonly performed now due to transfer metatarsalgia. |
| **Lapidus Procedure** | Arthrodesis (fusion) of the first metatarsal-cuneiform joint. | Hyper-mobility of the first ray. |
| **McBride Procedure** | Soft tissue release only (adductor tenotomy, lateral capsule release). | Mild deformity without bony malalignment (rarely done in isolation). |

> **Clinical Implication:** **Keller's operation** is easy to perform and relieves pain reliably in the elderly, but it shortens the toe and weakens the push-off power of the hallux, making it unsuitable for young adults.

### Complications
*   **Recurrence:** Common if the underlying cause (e.g., tight shoes) continues or if surgical correction was inadequate.
*   **[[Hallux Varus]]:** Overcorrection where the toe deviates medially (often iatrogenic).
*   **Avascular Necrosis (AVN):** Of the metatarsal head (risk with distal osteotomies).
*   **Transfer Metatarsalgia:** Pain under the 2nd/3rd metatarsal heads if the 1st ray is shortened or elevated excessively.
*   **Nerve Injury:** Injury to the dorsal cutaneous nerve.
