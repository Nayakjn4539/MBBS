# [[Regional Conditions]] > Hammer Toe and Claw Toe

### Overview of Lesser Toe Deformities

Deformities of the lesser toes are common foot complaints, often resulting from muscle imbalance or mechanical constriction. The diagnosis is primarily based on the specific joints involved and the position of the deformity.

**Comparative Anatomy of Deformities**

| Condition | [[Metatarsophalangeal Joint]] (MTP) | [[Proximal Interphalangeal Joint]] (PIP) | [[Distal Interphalangeal Joint]] (DIP) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Hammer Toe]]** | Extended (or Neutral) | **Flexed** | Extended (or Neutral) |
| **[[Claw Toe]]** | **Hyperextended** | **Flexed** | **Flexed** |
| **[[Mallet Toe]]** | Neutral | Neutral | **Flexed** |

### Hammer Toe

#### Definition
[[Hammer toe]] is a deformity characterized by **flexion of the [[proximal interphalangeal joint]] (PIP)** and extension of the [[distal interphalangeal joint]] (DIP). The [[metatarsophalangeal joint]] (MTP) is usually extended or neutral. It most commonly affects the **second toe**.

#### Etiology and Pathogenesis
*   **Mechanical Constriction:** Often caused by wearing shoes that are too short or have pointed toes (crowding).
*   **Long Second Toe:** A second ray that is longer than the first (Greek foot) is prone to buckling in shoes.
*   **[[Hallux Valgus]]:** As the great toe deviates laterally, it crowds the second toe, forcing it into flexion.
*   **Muscle Imbalance:** Tightness of the [[flexor digitorum longus]] overrides the interossei.

#### Clinical Features
*   **Deformity:** The toe resembles a hammer.
*   **Painful Callosities (Corns):**
    *   **Dorsal Corn:** Develops over the prominent flexed PIP joint due to rubbing against the shoe box.
    *   **Tip Corn:** Callosity at the tip of the toe due to abnormal weight-bearing.
*   **Rigidity:** Can be flexible initially but becomes fixed (rigid) over time.

#### Treatment
**Conservative Management:**
*   **Footwear Modification:** Wide toe-box shoes to relieve pressure.
*   **Padding:** Corn pads or protective silicone sleeves to prevent friction.
*   **Splinting:** Taping to encourage extension (effective only in flexible deformities).

**Surgical Management:**
*   **Flexible Deformity:** [[Girdlestone-Taylor procedure]] (Flexor-to-extensor tendon transfer).
*   **Fixed Deformity:**
    *   **Excision Arthroplasty (Spike Operation):** Excision of the distal end of the proximal phalanx.
    *   **PIP Joint Arthrodesis:** Fusion of the PIP joint in extension.

### Claw Toe

#### Definition
[[Claw toe]] involves **hyperextension of the [[metatarsophalangeal joint]] (MTP)** combined with **flexion of both the [[proximal interphalangeal joint]] (PIP) and [[distal interphalangeal joint]] (DIP)**. It typically affects **multiple lesser toes** simultaneously.

#### Etiology (Intrinsic Minus Foot)
This condition is often associated with neuromuscular disorders that cause weakness or paralysis of the [[intrinsic muscles]] (lumbricals and interossei).
*   **Neurological Causes:** [[Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease]], [[Friedreich's ataxia]], [[Cerebral palsy]], [[Spina bifida]], or spinal dysraphism.
*   **Cavus Foot:** Often associated with [[Pes Cavus]] (high arch).
*   **Inflammatory:** [[Rheumatoid arthritis]] (due to synovitis destabilizing the MTP joint).
*   **Compartment Syndrome:** Ischemia of the deep posterior compartment of the leg (check for [[Volkmann's ischemic contracture]]).

#### Pathomechanics
*   Normal function of [[lumbricals]] and [[interossei]]: Flex the MTP joint and extend the IP joints.
*   **Intrinsic Failure:** When these muscles are weak, the long extensors hyperextend the MTP joint, and the long flexors (unchecked) flex the IP joints, creating the "claw" appearance.

#### Clinical Features
*   **Appearance:** The toes look like animal claws digging into the sole.
*   **Metatarsalgia:** Severe pain under the **metatarsal heads**. The hyperextension at the MTP joint pushes the metatarsal heads downward, increasing plantar pressure.
*   **Callosities:**
    *   Dorsal aspect of the PIP joints.
    *   Tips of the toes.
    *   Plantar aspect beneath the metatarsal heads.

#### Clinical Implications
*   **Neurological Assessment:** Bilateral symmetric claw toes should prompt a neurological workup (spinal examination) to rule out central or peripheral nervous system disorders.
*   **Diabetic Foot:** Claw toes in diabetics increase the risk of tip ulceration and subsequent osteomyelitis.

#### Treatment
**Conservative Management:**
*   **Extra-depth Shoes:** To accommodate the dorsal prominence.
*   **Metatarsal Pads:** Placed proximal to the metatarsal heads to offload pressure and relieve [[metatarsalgia]].

**Surgical Management:**
The goal is to correct the MTP hyperextension and IP flexion.
1.  **Soft Tissue Release:** Lengthening of the [[extensor digitorum longus]] tendons and dorsal capsulotomy of the MTP joint.
2.  **Tendon Transfer:** **Girdlestone-Taylor Procedure** (Transfer of the [[flexor digitorum longus]] to the extensor hood) to enable the flexor to act as an extensor of the IP joints and flexor of the MTP joint.
3.  **Jones Procedure:** (Specifically for Claw Hallux) Transfer of [[extensor hallucis longus]] to the neck of the first metatarsal + IP fusion.
4.  **Arthrodesis:** Fusion of the PIP and DIP joints in a straight position.

### Mnemonic for Toe Deformities

*   **M**allet = **D**IP flexion (**MD**)
*   **H**ammer = **P**IP flexion (**H**arry **P**otter)
*   **C**law = **M**TP extension + **I**Ps flexion (**C**law **M**y **I**Ps)
