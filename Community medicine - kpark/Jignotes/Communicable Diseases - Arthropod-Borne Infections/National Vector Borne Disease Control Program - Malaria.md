# [[Communicable Diseases - Arthropod-Borne Infections]] > National Vector Borne Disease Control Program - Malaria

### [[National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme]] (NVBDCP): Malaria

The NVBDCP is the umbrella programme for the prevention and control of vector-borne diseases in India, including Malaria, Filariasis, Kala-azar, Japanese Encephalitis, Dengue, and Chikungunya.

### 1. Epidemiological Determinants

**Agent Factors:**
*   **Agent:** Protozoan parasite of genus *Plasmodium*.
    *   *P. falciparum* (Most common in India, causes severe malaria).
    *   *P. vivax* (Widespread).
    *   *P. malariae* and *P. ovale* (Rare).
    *   *P. knowlesi* (Zoonotic malaria reported in A&N Islands).
*   **Life Cycle:**
    *   **Definitive Host:** Female Anopheles Mosquito (Sexual cycle/Sporogony).
    *   **Intermediate Host:** Man (Asexual cycle/Schizogony).

**Vector Factors:**
*   **Vector:** Female [[Anopheles mosquito]].
    *   **Rural vector:** *An. culicifacies* (Major vector).
    *   **Urban vector:** *An. stephensi* (Breeds in overhead tanks/wells).
    *   **Hilly/Forest vector:** *An. fluviatilis*.
*   **Feeding Habit:** Nocturnal biters (Dusk to Dawn).

**Host Factors:**
*   Affects all ages and sexes.
*   **High Risk:** Pregnant women, infants, tourists.
*   **Transmission:**
    *   Vector bite (Most common).
    *   Blood transfusion.
    *   Congenital transmission.
    *   Needle sharing (Drug addicts).

**Incubation Period:**
*   *P. falciparum:* 12 days (Range 9-14).
*   *P. vivax:* 14 days (Range 8-17).
*   *P. malariae:* 28 days.
*   *P. ovale:* 17 days.

### 2. Clinical Picture
The classical malaria paroxysm involves three stages:
1.  **Cold Stage:** Lassitude, headache, intense chilling and shivering (1/4 to 1 hour).
2.  **Hot Stage:** High temperature (up to 41°C), intense headache, hot dry skin (2-6 hours).
3.  **Sweating Stage:** Profuse sweating, temperature drops, patient exhausted but relieved.

*   **Periodicity:** Tertian (every 48 hours) in *Pv, Pf, Po*; Quartan (every 72 hours) in *Pm*.
*   **Severe Malaria:** Caused by *[[Plasmodium falciparum]]*. Complications include Cerebral malaria, Severe Anemia, Renal failure, ARDS, Hypoglycemia.

> **Mnemonic for Fever Stages:** **C**old **H**ot **S**weat (CHS).

### 3. Diagnosis
Under NVBDCP, presumptive treatment is **no longer recommended**. Diagnosis must be confirmed before treatment.

1.  **Microscopy (Gold Standard):**
    *   **Thick Smear:** High Sensitivity (Detects presence of parasite).
    *   **Thin Smear:** High Specificity (Identifies species).
    *   **Stain:** JSB (Jaswant Singh Bhattacharaya) stain is standard.
2.  **Rapid Diagnostic Kits ([[RDT]]):**
    *   Based on Histidine Rich Protein-2 (HRP-2) for *P. falciparum* and pLDH for other species.
    *   Bivalent RDTs are used in the program.

### 4. Treatment Guidelines (National Drug Policy 2013)

**A. Uncomplicated Malaria:**

| Type of Malaria | Treatment Regimen |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Plasmodium vivax]]** | **Chloroquine (3 days)** + **Primaquine (14 days)**. <br> *PQ dose: 0.25 mg/kg daily.* |
| **[[Plasmodium falciparum]]** (North-East States) | **ACT-AL (3 days)** + **Primaquine (Single dose)**. <br> *(Artemether + Lumefantrine)* |
| **[[Plasmodium falciparum]]** (Other States) | **ACT-SP (3 days)** + **Primaquine (Single dose)**. <br> *(Artesunate + Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine)* |

> **Clinical Relevance:** **[[Primaquine]]** is given to prevent relapse (kills hypnozoites in liver) in *P. vivax* and to block transmission (gametocidal) in *P. falciparum*.
> **Contraindications for Primaquine:** Pregnancy, Infants, G6PD deficiency.

**B. Treatment in Pregnancy:**
*   **P. vivax:** Chloroquine only. **No Primaquine**.
*   **P. falciparum:**
    *   **1st Trimester:** Quinine.
    *   **2nd & 3rd Trimester:** ACT.

**C. Severe Malaria:**
*   Parenteral Artimisin derivatives (Artesunate/Artemether) or Quinine IV/IM for at least 48 hours, followed by oral ACT.

### 5. Prevention and Control Strategies

**1. Surveillance and Case Management:**
*   **Active Surveillance:** Health workers visit houses fortnightly to detect fever cases and collect blood slides.
*   **Passive Surveillance:** Patients reporting to health facilities (PHC, hospitals).
*   **Sentinel Surveillance:** Monitoring trends.

**2. Integrated Vector Management (IVM):**
*   **Chemical Control:** [[Indoor Residual Spray]] (IRS) using DDT (rural), Malathion, or Synthetic Pyrethroids.
*   **Biological Control:** Use of larvivorous fish like *Gambusia* and *Poecilia* (Guppy).
*   **Personal Protection:** [[Insecticide Treated Bed Nets]] (ITBN) and Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs).
*   **Source Reduction:** Filling ditches, covering tanks, intermittent irrigation.

**3. Anti-Malaria Month:** Observed in **June** every year (before monsoon) for awareness.

### 6. Program Indicators

1.  **[[Annual Parasite Incidence]] (API):** $\frac{\text{Confirmed Cases in a year}}{\text{Population under surveillance}} \times 1000$. It is the sophisticated measure of malaria incidence.
2.  **Annual Blood Examination Rate (ABER):** Indicator of operational efficiency. Target is >10%.
3.  **Slide Positivity Rate (SPR):** Percentage of slides found positive.
4.  **Slide Falciparum Rate (SFR):** Percentage of slides positive for *P. falciparum*.

### 7. National Framework for Malaria Elimination (NFME 2016-2030)

**Goal:** Eliminate malaria (zero indigenous cases) throughout India by **2030**.

**Categorization of States:**
*   **Category 0 (Prevention of re-establishment):** Zero indigenous cases.
*   **Category 1 (Elimination Phase):** API < 1 (all districts).
*   **Category 2 (Pre-elimination Phase):** API < 1 (state average) but some districts > 1.
*   **Category 3 (Intensified Control Phase):** API > 1.
