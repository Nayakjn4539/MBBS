# [[Nose]] > CSF Rhinorrhea

### Definition
[[CSF Rhinorrhea]] is the leakage of **cerebrospinal fluid** from the intracranial space into the nasal cavity due to a defect in the dura mater and the skull base. It implies a communication (fistula) between the subarachnoid space and the sinonasal tract.

### Physiology
*   **Production:** CSF is secreted by the choroid plexus in the ventricles (approx. 20 mL/hour or 500 mL/day).
*   **Total Volume:** 90–150 mL (replaced 3–5 times daily).
*   **Pressure:** Normal pressure is 50–150 mm H2O. Pressure increases with coughing, sneezing, or straining.

---

### Etiology and Classification
CSF rhinorrhea is broadly classified into **Traumatic** and **Non-traumatic** causes.

#### 1. Traumatic (95% of cases)
*   **Accidental (80%):** Head injuries, skull base fractures.
    *   **Anterior Fossa:** Fractures of the [[cribriform plate]] or ethmoid roof.
    *   **Middle Fossa:** Sphenoid sinus fractures.
    *   **Temporal Bone:** Transverse fractures allowing CSF to enter the middle ear and drain through the [[Eustachian tube]] into the nose (**CSF Otorhinorrhea**).
    *   *Note:* Le Fort II and III fractures are commonly associated with CSF leaks.
*   **Iatrogenic (15%):**
    *   **Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery ([[FESS]]):** Injury to the lateral lamella of the cribriform plate.
    *   **Neurosurgery:** Trans-sphenoidal hypophysectomy.
    *   **Septoplasty:** Avulsion of the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid.

#### 2. Non-Traumatic / Spontaneous (5%)
*   **High Pressure Leaks:** Due to raised intracranial pressure (ICP).
    *   Intracranial tumors (e.g., pituitary neoplasms).
    *   Hydrocephalus.
    *   [[Benign Intracranial Hypertension]] (Pseudotumor cerebri).
*   **Normal Pressure Leaks:**
    *   **Congenital defects:** Dehiscence in the skull base (e.g., meningocele, encephalocele).
    *   **[[Empty Sella Syndrome]]:** Arachnoid herniation into the sella turcica causing erosion.
    *   **Infection:** Osteomyelitis or fungal sinusitis eroding the bone.
    *   **Tumors:** Direct erosion by sinonasal malignancies (e.g., [[Esthesioneuroblastoma]]) or nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

### Sites of Leakage
The defect can occur in the Anterior, Middle, or Posterior cranial fossa.

| Fossa | Pathway to Nose | Key Structure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Anterior** | Via Cribriform plate (Most Common) | **Lateral Lamella** (thinnest part of skull base) |
| | Via Frontal Sinus | Posterior table fracture |
| | Via Ethmoid Air Cells | Fovea ethmoidalis |
| **Middle** | Via Sphenoid Sinus | Sella turcica / Sphenoid roof |
| **Posterior** | Via Temporal Bone $\rightarrow$ Middle Ear $\rightarrow$ Eustachian Tube | Tegmen tympani / Petrous bone |

### Clinical Features
*   **Unilateral Watery Rhinorrhea:** Clear, watery, non-sticky discharge.
*   **Positional Aggravation:** Discharge increases on bending forward or straining (valsalva).
*   **[[Reservoir Sign]]:** Gush of fluid upon changing posture (e.g., sitting up in the morning) due to accumulation of CSF in the sphenoid sinus during sleep.
*   **Taste:** Patient may complain of a sweet or salty taste (CSF contains glucose and electrolytes).
*   **Associated Symptoms:**
    *   **Anosmia:** In 80% of traumatic cases due to olfactory nerve injury.
    *   **Headache:** Low-pressure headache (worse when upright) or high-pressure headache in spontaneous cases.
    *   **Recurrent Meningitis:** May be the only presentation in silent leaks.

### Diagnosis and Investigations

#### 1. Bedside Tests (To differentiate from nasal mucus)
| Test | CSF Rhinorrhea | Nasal Secretions (Rhinitis) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Handkerchief Test** | Does **not** stiffen on drying (low protein) | Stiffens/starches the cloth (high mucin) |
| **Sniff Test** | Cannot be sniffed back (dribbles) | Can be sniffed back |
| **[[Halo Sign]] / Target Sign** | If mixed with blood, CSF separates as a clear halo around the central blood clot on filter paper | No separation (blood remains uniform) |
| **Glucose Test** | **Unreliable.** False positives possible due to lacrimal secretions | < 10 mg/dL |

*Clinical Implication:* Glucose oxidase strips are **not** recommended for diagnosis because they have high false-positive rates.

#### 2. Laboratory Investigations (Confirmatory)
*   **[[Beta-2 Transferrin]]:**
    *   **Gold Standard/Pathognomonic.**
    *   This protein is found *only* in CSF, perilymph, and aqueous humor; absent in nasal mucus, tears, or serum.
    *   Requires electrophoresis.
*   **[[Beta-Trace Protein]]:** Specific marker synthesized in the arachnoid cells and choroid plexus.

#### 3. Radiological Imaging (Localization)
*   **High-Resolution CT ([[HRCT]]):**
    *   **Investigation of Choice** for identifying bony defects.
    *   Fine coronal cuts (1–2 mm) are best to visualize the cribriform plate and ethmoid roof.
*   **CT Cisternography:**
    *   Involves intrathecal contrast (metrizamide/omnipaque).
    *   Best for localizing **active leaks**.
*   **MRI (T2-Weighted):**
    *   Useful for distinguishing CSF (bright signal) from inflammatory tissue.
    *   Best for diagnosing **[[Meningoencephalocele]]** or intracranial tumors.
*   **Intrathecal Fluorescein:**
    *   0.1 mL of 5% Fluorescein diluted in CSF is injected via lumbar puncture.
    *   Nasal endoscopy is performed using a blue light filter to visualize the leak (green fluorescence).
    *   Used intra-operatively or for difficult diagnoses.

### Differential Diagnosis
Comparison between CSF Rhinorrhea and Allergic Rhinitis:

| Feature | CSF Rhinorrhea | Allergic Rhinitis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **History** | Trauma/Surgery | Sneezing, Itching, Atopy |
| **Discharge** | Watery, Clear | Mucoid, Slimy |
| **Flow** | Gushes (drops) on bending | Continuous |
| **Taste** | Sweet/Salty | Salty/Tasteless |
| **Sniffing** | Impossible | Possible |
| **Beta-2 Transferrin**| **Present** | Absent |

---

### Complications
*   **[[Meningitis]]:** The most serious complication due to ascending infection (risk increases with duration of leak).
*   **Pneumocephalus:** Air entering the cranial cavity.
*   **Brain Abscess**.

---

### Management

#### 1. Conservative Management
Most **traumatic** CSF leaks (especially acute) heal spontaneously within **7–14 days**.
*   **Bed Rest:** Head elevation (30–45 degrees) to reduce intracranial pressure.
*   **Avoid Straining:** No nose blowing, sneezing with mouth open, stool softeners to prevent Valsalva.
*   **Medication:**
    *   Acetazolamide (carbonic anhydrase inhibitor) to decrease CSF production.
    *   Prophylactic antibiotics: Controversial; may mask meningitis signs but often used.
*   **Lumbar Drain:** Continuous drainage to lower CSF pressure in persistent cases.

#### 2. Surgical Management
Indicated if conservative management fails after 2 weeks, in cases of recurrent meningitis, or large bony defects (e.g., gunshot wounds).

*   **Intracranial Approach:** Neurosurgical craniotomy (high morbidity, loss of smell).
*   **Extracranial Approach (Preferred):**
    *   **Endoscopic Endonasal Repair:** **Treatment of choice**.
    *   Excellent visualization, high success rate (90%), cosmetic advantage, preserves olfaction.
    *   **External Approaches:** External ethmoidectomy or osteoplastic flap (rarely used now).

**Steps of Endoscopic Repair:**
1.  Localization of the defect (using Fluorescein if needed).
2.  Preparation of the graft bed (cleaning mucosa around the defect).
3.  **Grafting:** Using **Underlay technique** (graft placed between dura and bone).
4.  **Materials:**
    *   *Autografts:* Temporalis fascia, fascia lata, fat, muscle, septal cartilage.
    *   *Adhesives:* Fibrin glue.
5.  Support with Gelfoam and nasal packing.
