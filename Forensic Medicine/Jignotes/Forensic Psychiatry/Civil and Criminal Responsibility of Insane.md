# [[Forensic Psychiatry]] > Civil and Criminal Responsibility of Insane

### Civil Responsibility of the Insane

The civil responsibility of a mentally ill person depends on whether they are capable of understanding the implications of their actions at the specific time.

**1. Management of Property and Affairs**
*   If a person is incapable of managing their property due to [[Mental Illness]], the court (District or High Court) can appoint a **Manager** to look after the property.
*   If they cannot take care of themselves, a **Guardian** is appointed.
*   Two medical certificates are usually required to prove incapacity.

**2. Contracts**
*   A contract is **invalid** if, at the time of making it, the person was incapable of understanding it and forming a rational judgment regarding its effect on their interests.
*   A contract made during a [[Lucid Interval]] is **valid**.

**3. Marriage**
*   **Hindu Marriage Act (1955):** Marriage is voidable if, at the time of marriage, a party was:
    *   Incapable of giving valid consent due to unsoundness of mind.
    *   Suffering from mental disorder unfit for marriage and procreation.
    *   Suffering from recurrent attacks of insanity.
*   Insanity developing *after* marriage (incurable and continuous) is a valid ground for **divorce**.

**4. Competency as a Witness (Sec 118 IEA)**
*   A mentally ill person is **competent** to testify if they can:
    *   Understand the questions put to them.
    *   Give rational answers.
*   A lunatic is not incompetent unless prevented by his lunacy from understanding the questions.

**5. Testamentary Capacity (Capacity to Make a Will)**
This is the legal ability to make a valid Will. The medical officer must certify that the testator is of a **"Sound Disposing Mind"**.

**Criteria for a Valid Will (The "Sound Disposing Mind"):**
The testator must:
1.  Understand the **nature** of the act (that he is making a will).
2.  Know the **extent** of his property to be disposed of.
3.  Know the **claims** of the persons who would naturally be the objects of his bounty (relatives/heirs).
4.  Be free from any **insane delusions** or undue influence affecting the will.
5.  Have a sound **memory** (Agraphia or aphasia does not invalidate a will if gestures are clear).

> **Mnemonic: TEST for Will**
> *   **T** - Time (Consciousness at the time of signing)
> *   **E** - Extent of property known
> *   **S** - Sound mind (Free from delusions)
> *   **T** - Those who are beneficiaries (Knows relations)

### Criminal Responsibility of the Insane

The law presumes every person is sane until proven otherwise. The defense of insanity is based on the principle of *Mens Rea* (Guilty Mind)—an act is not a crime unless it is done with a guilty intent.

#### 1. Section 84 IPC (McNaughten’s Rule)
This is the cornerstone of the insanity defense in India.
*"Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law."*

**Key Elements:**
*   The accused must be of **unsound mind** at the **time of committing the crime**.
*   There must be impairment of **Cognitive Faculties** (Reasoning power).
*   The impairment must be such that the person did not know:
    1.  The **Nature and Quality** of the act.
    2.  That the act was **Wrong** or **Contrary to law**.

#### 2. Legal vs. Medical Insanity
*   **Medical Insanity:** Any mental disease or disorder defined by psychiatry (e.g., [[Schizophrenia]], [[Depression]]).
*   **Legal Insanity:** A person is legally insane only if the mental illness deprives them of the power of reasoning (Cognitive Faculty) to understand the nature or wrongfulness of the act.
*   *Note:* All medically insane persons are not legally insane.

#### 3. McNaughten’s Rules (1843)
Originated in England, adopted in Section 84 IPC.
*   Every man is presumed to be sane.
*   To establish a defense on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that at the time of the committing of the act, the party was laboring under such a **defect of reason**, from **disease of the mind**, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.

#### 4. Specific Conditions & Responsibility
| Condition | Criminal Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Lucid Interval]]** | **Responsible.** Acts done during a lucid interval are legally valid and punishable. |
| **[[Delirium Tremens]]** | **Not Responsible.** Considered a form of insanity. |
| **Somnambulism** | **Not Responsible.** Acts are automatic/involuntary. |
| **Epileptic Automatism** | **Not Responsible.** Acts performed during post-epileptic automatism lack intent. |
| **Irresistible Impulse** | **Responsible** in India (generally), unless covered under Sec 84 (total loss of cognitive control). Known as "Policeman at the elbow test". |
| **Drunkenness** | **Voluntary (Sec 86 IPC):** Responsible. <br> **Involuntary (Sec 85 IPC):** Not Responsible. |

### Medicolegal Assessment: True vs. Feigned Insanity

Criminals often fake insanity to escape punishment. This is called **Feigned Insanity**.

**Table: Differentiation between True and Feigned Insanity**

| Feature | True Insanity | Feigned Insanity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Onset** | Usually gradual. | Sudden. |
| **Motive** | Often absent or very trivial. | Always present (to avoid punishment). |
| **Predisposing Factors** | Family history, stress, etc., often present. | Usually absent. |
| **Facial Expression** | Vacant, staring, restless, rigid. | Alert, watchful, shifting eyes. |
| **Signs/Symptoms** | Uniform, consistent with a specific disease type. | Inconsistent, exaggerated, mixed symptoms. |
| **Physical Manifestation**| Dry skin, coated tongue, constipation, insomnia. | Normal skin, clean tongue, normal bodily functions. |
| **Sleep** | Can go without sleep for days (Insomnia). | Sleeps when thinks not watched; cannot sustain sleeplessness long. |
| **Exertion** | Can withstand exhaustion/hunger. | Cannot withstand fatigue; breaks down easily. |
| **Reaction to Exam** | Indifferent; does not mind examination. | Resents examination; tries to prove insanity. |
| **Conduct** | Same whether watched or not. | Behaves "insane" only when watched. |

> **Mnemonic for Feigned Insanity: FAKE**
> *   **F** - Fatigue (Cannot sustain the act)
> *   **A** - Alert (Watchful eyes)
> *   **K** - Keeps changing symptoms (Inconsistent)
> *   **E** - Exaggerated behavior

### Procedure for Examination (Plea of Insanity)
1.  **Admission:** The accused is kept under observation in a psychiatric hospital (usually for 10 days, extendable to 30 days).
2.  **Observation:** Nurses and attendants observe behavior when the accused thinks they are alone (eating, sleeping, hygiene).
3.  **Physical Exam:** Look for signs of organic disease, drug abuse, or self-inflicted injuries.
4.  **Mental Status Exam (MSE):** Assess orientation, memory, delusions, hallucinations.
5.  **Report:** The doctor must give an opinion on the mental state *at the time of examination* and, based on history/evidence, infer the state *at the time of the crime*.
