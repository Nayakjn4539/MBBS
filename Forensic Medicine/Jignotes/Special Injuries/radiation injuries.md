### Radiation Injuries

[[Radiation injuries]] are tissue injuries caused by the application of ionizing or non-ionizing radiation to the external or internal body surfaces. In forensic practice, these are encountered in industrial accidents, therapeutic misadventures (iatrogenic), nuclear warfare, or terrorist attacks (dirty bombs).

### Classification of Radiation

1.  **Ionizing Radiation:** High energy, capable of removing electrons from atoms (ionization).
    *   **Electromagnetic:** X-rays, Gamma ($\gamma$) rays.
    *   **Particulate:** Alpha ($\alpha$) particles, Beta ($\beta$) particles, Neutrons.
2.  **Non-Ionizing Radiation:** Lower energy, causes excitation/heating but not ionization.
    *   Ultraviolet (UV), Infrared (IR), Microwave, Laser.

### Factors Influencing Radiation Injury

The extent of biological damage depends on:
*   **Type of Radiation:** $\alpha$ particles are heavy and damaging but have low penetration (stopped by skin/paper); $\gamma$ rays have deep penetration.
*   **Dose and Rate:** High doses over a short time are more lethal than fractionated doses.
*   **Surface Area:** Whole-body exposure is more fatal than localized exposure.
*   **Tissue Sensitivity:** Rapidly dividing cells are more radiosensitive (Law of Bergonié and Tribondeau).
    *   *High Sensitivity:* [[Bone marrow]], lymphoid tissue, GI lining, gonads.
    *   *Low Sensitivity:* Bone, muscle, nerve tissue.

### Clinical Manifestations

#### 1. Local Radiation Injury (Radiation Burns)
Unlike thermal burns, radiation burns have a **latent period** (delay) between exposure and symptoms.

*   **First Degree (Erythema):** Redness, itching, and burning sensation appearing after a latent period of *hours to days*. Causes epilation (hair loss).
*   **Second Degree (Blistering):** Formation of vesicles/blebs, edema, and superficial ulceration.
*   **Third Degree (Necrosis):** Deep ulceration, necrosis of underlying tissues, and slow healing. May lead to [[gangrene]].
*   **Chronic Radiodermatitis:** Atrophy, pigmentation changes, telangiectasia, and loss of hair follicles/sweat glands. May progress to squamous cell carcinoma (Marjolin's ulcer).

#### 2. Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS)
Occurs following whole-body exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation. It progresses through four stages:

1.  **Prodromal Stage:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue (minutes to days post-exposure).
2.  **Latent Stage:** Symptom-free period (patient appears to recover).
3.  **Manifest Illness Stage:** Overt clinical syndromes based on dose.
4.  **Recovery or Death.**

| Syndrome | Dose (Gy/Rad) | Pathophysiology | Prognosis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Hematopoietic Syndrome]]** | 1–10 Gy (100–1000 rads) | Bone marrow suppression (pancytopenia). Death due to infection or hemorrhage. | Survival possible with treatment. |
| **[[Gastrointestinal Syndrome]]** | 10–20 Gy (1000–2000 rads) | Destruction of intestinal villi. Severe fluid loss, electrolyte imbalance, sepsis. | Death likely within 2 weeks. |
| **[[Cerebrovascular Syndrome]]** | >50 Gy (>5000 rads) | Cerebral edema, vasculitis, meningitis. Convulsions, ataxia, coma. | Death within hours to days (100% fatal). |

> **Mnemonic for ARS Stages:** **P**lease **L**et **M**e **H**eal
> *   **P**rodromal
> *   **L**atent
> *   **M**anifest Illness
> *   **H**ealing or Death

#### 3. Delayed/Chronic Effects
*   **Carcinogenesis:** [[Leukemia]] (most common), thyroid cancer, skin cancer, osteosarcoma (radium watch dial painters).
*   **Teratogenicity:** Microcephaly, growth retardation if fetus exposed.
*   **Cataracts:** Posterior subcapsular cataracts.
*   **Sterility:** Permanent or temporary azoospermia/amenorrhea.

### Autopsy of a Radioactive Corpse

Handling a radioactive body requires strict adherence to safety protocols to protect the autopsy team. The [[Medical Officer]] must determine the level of radioactivity before commencing.

**Safety Precautions:**
1.  **Measurement:** Use a **Geiger-Muller counter** to measure radiation levels.
2.  **PPE:** Wear dosimeters (film badges), heavy rubber gloves (double gloving), waterproof plastic aprons, and shoe covers.
3.  **Technique:**
    *   **Avoid dust:** Use rib cutters instead of electric saws to prevent bone dust aerosols.
    *   **Fluid disposal:** Flush body fluids copiously with water directly into the sewer.
    *   **Time/Distance:** Minimise time spent near the body; use long-handled instruments.

**Guidelines for Autopsy based on Radioactivity Levels:**

| Radioactivity Level | Protocol |
| :--- | :--- |
| **< 5 mCi** (millicuries) | No extra precautions needed. Routine autopsy. |
| **5 – 30 mCi** | **Caution required.** Use radiation tags. Remove organs with highest radioactivity first and store in lead containers. |
| **> 30 mCi** | **No autopsy.** The body should be kept in storage to allow radioactive decay or embalmed in the hospital morgue without opening. |
| **> 300 mCi** (post-autopsy) | If the body retains high activity after autopsy, it must be embalmed. |

**Disposal:**
*   Body should be washed thoroughly to reduce surface contamination.
*   Instruments must be soaked in soap/detergent water to reduce radiation to safe levels.
*   [[Cremation]] may be hazardous if the body contains radioactive implants or mercury batteries (pacemakers), which can explode or release radioactive gas.

### Medicolegal Aspects

1.  **Accidental:** Most common. Industrial mishaps (nuclear plants), laboratory accidents, or inadvertent exposure to lost radioactive sources (e.g., Cobalt-60 scrap metal incidents).
2.  **Therapeutic Misadventure (Iatrogenic):**
    *   **Overdosage:** Negligence in calculating the dose during [[radiotherapy]].
    *   **Burns:** Resulting from fluoroscopy or prolonged X-ray exposure.
    *   **Neoplasia:** Development of cancer years after therapeutic radiation (e.g., for ankylosing spondylitis or ringworm in the past).
3.  **Homicidal:** Rare. Example: Poisoning with Polonium-210 (Alexander Litvinenko case).
4.  **Suicidal:** Extremely rare.
5.  **Warfare/Terrorism:** Use of nuclear weapons or "Dirty Bombs" (conventional explosives dispersing radioactive material) to cause panic and contamination.
이전 연구에서 뇌파 데이터를 기반으로 한 CNN, RNN, LSTM 기반 딥러닝 모델이 운전자 조작 여부를 분류하는 데 효과적임을 확인하였다. 본 연구는 이 모델들의 설명을 위해 LRP를 적용하였으나, LRP는 CNN 및 완전 연결 층에는 효과적이었지만, RNN 계열 모델에서는 그 성능이 제한적이었다. 이를 해결하기 위해 LRP-Sequential 방법이 제안되었다.

본 연구에서는 기존 연구에 사용된 운전자 조작 분류 모델을 개선하였다. 기존에는 1차원 데이터 처리에 2D CNN을 사용했으나, 본 연구에서는 1D CNN을 도입해 데이터 처리 효율성을 높였다. 또한, RNN 대신 LSTM을 사용해 시계열 데이터의 장기 의존성을 학습하게 했다. 개선된 모델은 1D CNN, LSTM 층, 그리고 완전 연결 층으로 구성되었다.

이 모델은 30명의 피실험자로부터 수집된 뇌파 데이터를 사용해 5-겹 교차 검증을 통해 학습 및 평가되었다. 데이터는 정규화와 필터링 과정을 거쳤다. LRP 적용을 위해 기존 모델 구조를 LRP-Sequential에 적합하도록 수정하였다.

실험 결과, 개선된 모델의 평균 정확도는 85.34%였다. LRP 분석을 통해 모델이 예측에 중요하게 고려한 뇌파 채널과 주파수 대역을 시각화하였다. 이 결과는 뇌파 데이터와 운전자 상태 간의 관계를 이해하는 데 기여하며, 자율 주행 시스템에서 운전자 모니터링 시스템의 신뢰성을 높일 수 있는 가능성을 제시하였다.

본 연구의 한계점으로는 피실험자 수의 부족과 데이터 전처리의 단순성 등이 있으며, 향후 연구에서는 더 많은 데이터와 정교한 전처리 방법을 도입하여 모델의 성능과 설명 가능성을 더욱 향상할 계획이다. 또한, 다양한 딥러닝 아키텍처와 설명 가능성 방법론을 비교 분석하여 최적의 모델을 도출하고자 한다.In a previous study, it was confirmed that CNN, RNN, and LSTM-based deep learning models based on EEG data were effective in classifying whether or not the driver manipulated the vehicle. This study applied LRP to explain these models, but LRP was effective for CNN and fully connected layers, but its performance was limited for RNN-based models. To solve this, the LRP-Sequential method was proposed.

In this study, the driver manipulation classification model used in the existing study was improved. Previously, 2D CNN was used for 1D data processing, but in this study, 1D CNN was introduced to increase data processing efficiency. In addition, LSTM was used instead of RNN to learn long-term dependencies of time series data. The improved model consisted of 1D CNN, LSTM layer, and fully connected layer.

This model was trained and evaluated through 5-fold cross-validation using EEG data collected from 30 subjects. The data underwent normalization and filtering processes. For LRP application, the existing model structure was modified to suit LRP-Sequential.

Experimental results showed that the average accuracy of the improved model was 85.34%. Through LRP analysis, the EEG channels and frequency bands that the model considered important for prediction were visualized. These results contribute to understanding the relationship between EEG data and driver status, and suggest the possibility of increasing the reliability of driver monitoring systems in autonomous driving systems.

Limitations of this study include the small number of subjects and the simplicity of data preprocessing. In future studies, we plan to further improve the performance and explainability of the model by introducing more data and sophisticated preprocessing methods. In addition, we plan to derive an optimal model by comparatively analyzing various deep learning architectures and explainability methodologies.
