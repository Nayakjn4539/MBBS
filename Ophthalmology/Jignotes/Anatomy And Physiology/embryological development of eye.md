# [[Anatomy And Physiology]] > embryological development of eye

### General Overview of Ocular Embryology

The development of the eye is a complex process coordinated between multiple embryonic tissues. It begins very early in gestation, specifically around **Day 22** (3rd week) when the embryo is approximately 2mm long,. The majority of ocular development occurs between **Week 3 and Week 10**.

The eye is derived from four main sources:
1.  **Neuroectoderm** (from the forebrain).
2.  **Surface Ectoderm** (from the side of the head).
3.  **Neural Crest Cells** (migrating cells).
4.  **Mesoderm**.

### Derivatives of Embryonic Layers

This is a high-yield topic for examinations. The structures of the [[eye]] are formed by specific germ layers,,,.

| Germ Layer | Derivatives and Structures |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Surface Ectoderm** | • [[Crystalline lens]]<br>• Epithelium of [[cornea]]<br>• Epithelium of [[conjunctiva]]<br>• [[Lacrimal gland]]<br>• Epidermis of [[eyelids]] and cilia<br>• Epithelium of [[lacrimal drainage system]] |
| **Neural Ectoderm** | • [[Retina]] (Neurosensory and RPE)<br>• Epithelium of [[ciliary body]] and [[iris]]<br>• [[Optic nerve]] (neuroglial and nervous elements)<br>• Muscles of iris ([[sphincter pupillae]] and [[dilator pupillae]])<br>• Secondary and Tertiary [[vitreous]] |
| **Neural Crest Cells** | • [[Corneal stroma]] and [[corneal endothelium]]<br>• [[Trabecular meshwork]]<br>• [[Sclera]] (except temporal portion)<br>• [[Uveal melanocytes]]<br>• [[Ciliary muscle]] and [[Choroidal stroma]]<br>• Meningeal sheaths of optic nerve |
| **Mesoderm** | • [[Extraocular muscles]]<br>• Vascular endothelium of eye and orbit<br>• Primary [[vitreous]]<br>• Temporal portion of [[sclera]] |

**Mnemonic for Surface Ectoderm:** "**L**ens, **L**acrimal, **L**ids, and **E**pithelium (Cornea/Conjunctiva)."

### Stages of Development

#### 1. Formation of Optic Vesicle and Optic Cup
*   **Optic Pits/Grooves:** Appear in the neural fold of the prosencephalon (forebrain) around Day 22.
*   **Optic Vesicle:** The pits deepen and evaginate to form the [[optic vesicle]] by the 4th week,.
*   **Optic Cup:** The optic vesicle invaginates to form a double-layered [[optic cup]].
    *   **Inner Layer:** Differentiates into the **Neurosensory [[Retina]]**.
    *   **Outer Layer:** Differentiates into the **[[Retinal Pigment Epithelium]] (RPE)**.
    *   **Intra-retinal Space:** The space between these two layers represents the original cavity of the optic vesicle. In adults, this remains a potential space where [[retinal detachment]] can occur,.

#### 2. The Embryonic Fissure (Choroidal Fissure)
*   **Formation:** As the optic cup forms, invagination occurs inferiorly, creating a groove known as the **Embryonic Fissure** (or Choroidal Fissure).
*   **Function:** Allows the **[[hyaloid artery]]** to enter the eye to supply the developing lens and retina.
*   **Closure:** The fissure fuses by **Week 7** of gestation.
*   **Clinical Implication:** Failure of this fissure to close results in a [[coloboma]] (iris, choroid, or optic disc),.

#### 3. Development of the Lens
*   **Lens Placode:** The optic vesicle induces the overlying [[surface ectoderm]] to thicken, forming the [[lens placode]] at 4 weeks.
*   **Lens Pit & Vesicle:** The placode invaginates to form the lens pit, which pinches off to form the **[[lens vesicle]]** by the 1st month (Day 33).
*   **Lens Fibers:**
    *   **Primary Lens Fibers:** Cells of the posterior wall of the vesicle elongate anteriorly to fill the cavity. These form the **[[embryonic nucleus]]** (1-3 months),.
    *   **Secondary Lens Fibers:** Formed from equatorial cells throughout life.

### Development of Specific Structures

#### Retina and Optic Nerve
*   **Retina:** Developed from the two walls of the optic cup.
    *   **Matrix Layer:** Forms [[rods]] and [[cones]].
    *   **Mantle Layer:** Forms [[bipolar cells]], [[ganglion cells]], and supporting tissue.
    *   **Marginal Layer:** Forms the nerve fiber layer.
*   **Optic Nerve:**
    *   Axons from retinal ganglion cells grow into the [[optic stalk]] by the 6th week.
    *   **Myelination:** Begins at the brain and moves distally. It reaches the **[[lamina cribrosa]]** just before birth and usually stops there,.
    *   *Clinical Implication:* If myelination continues past the lamina cribrosa, it presents as **[[myelinated nerve fibers]]**, appearing as feathery white patches on the fundus,,.

#### Uveal Tract (Iris, Ciliary Body, Choroid)
*   **Iris:**
    *   **Epithelium:** Both layers derived from the marginal region of the [[optic cup]] (Neuroectoderm).
    *   **Muscles:** [[Sphincter pupillae]] and [[Dilator pupillae]] develop from the anterior epithelium (Neuroectoderm),.
    *   **Stroma:** Derived from Neural Crest.
*   **Ciliary Body:** Epithelium from neuroectoderm; muscle and stroma from neural crest/mesenchyme.
*   **Choroid:** Derived from mesenchyme surrounding the optic cup.

#### Cornea and Sclera
*   **Corneal Epithelium:** Derived from [[surface ectoderm]].
*   **Corneal Stroma/Endothelium:** Derived from [[neural crest cells]],.
*   **Sclera:** Formed by condensation of mesenchyme (Neural crest) surrounding the optic cup.

#### Vitreous
*   **Primary Vitreous:** Mesenchymal origin (Neural Crest/Mesoderm). Contains the [[hyaloid artery]] system. Present around 1st month,.
*   **Secondary Vitreous:** Neuroectodermal origin (secreted by optic cup). This is the definitive avascular [[vitreous body]]. It pushes the primary vitreous anteriorly (Cloquet's canal),.
*   **Tertiary Vitreous:** Forms the [[ciliary zonules]] (suspensory ligaments).

#### Eyelids and Lacrimal Apparatus
*   **Eyelids:** Form as folds of surface ectoderm with a mesenchymal core. They fuse at 3 months and separate at the **7th month**,.
*   **Lacrimal Gland:** Develops as epithelial buds from the superolateral conjunctival sac.
*   **Nasolacrimal Duct:** Develops from a buried cord of ectoderm. Canalization is usually complete at birth; failure leads to [[congenital dacryocystitis]].

### Clinical Implications of Development

1.  **Coloboma:**
    *   **Cause:** Defective closure of the [[embryonic fissure]].
    *   **Location:** Typically inferonasal (Typical Coloboma),.
    *   **Structures:** Can affect iris (keyhole pupil), ciliary body, choroid, retina, or optic nerve.

2.  **Congenital Cataract:**
    *   Interference with lens fiber formation.
    *   **Rubella Cataract:** Associated with maternal rubella infection (1st trimester). Often **Nuclear Pearly Cataract**.
    *   **Blue Dot Cataract:** Most common congenital type, usually visually insignificant.

3.  **Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP):**
    *   Retinal vascularization reaches the nasal periphery by **8 months** but the temporal periphery only by **1 month after birth**.
    *   Premature infants have incompletely vascularized temporal retina, making them susceptible to ROP.

4.  **Congenital Glaucoma (Buphthalmos):**
    *   Caused by maldevelopment of the [[trabecular meshwork]] (trabeculodysgenesis) derived from neural crest cells,.

5.  **Persistent Hyperplastic Primary Vitreous (PHPV):**
    *   Failure of the primary vitreous and hyaloid artery to regress. Presents as [[leukocoria]].

6.  **Cryptophthalmos:**
    *   Failure of eyelid formation/differentiation; skin passes continuously over the eyeball.
