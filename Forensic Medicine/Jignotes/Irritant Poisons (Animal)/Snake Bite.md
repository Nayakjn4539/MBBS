### Snake Bite (Ophitoxemia)

**Snake bite** envenomation, medically termed [[Ophitoxemia]], is a significant medical emergency, particularly in tropical regions. It is a complex poisoning caused by the injection of venom through specialized fangs.

### Classification of Snakes
Snakes are broadly classified into poisonous and non-poisonous. In India, the "Big Four" venomous snakes responsible for most deaths are:
1.  **Elapidae (Neurotoxic):** [[Common Cobra]] (*Naja naja*), [[Common Krait]] (*Bungarus caeruleus*).
2.  **Viperidae (Vasculotoxic/Haemotoxic):** [[Russell's Viper]] (*Daboia russelii*), [[Saw-scaled Viper]] (*Echis carinatus*).
3.  **Hydrophidae (Myotoxic):** Sea snakes.

#### Differentiating Poisonous vs. Non-Poisonous Snakes
| Feature | Poisonous Snake | Non-Poisonous Snake |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Belly Scales** | Large, cover the entire breadth of the belly | Small, do not cover the entire breadth |
| **Head Scales** | Small (except Cobra/Krait have large shields) | Large shields |
| **Fangs** | Present (Hollow/Grooved) | Absent (Only small solid teeth) |
| **Bite Mark** | Two deep puncture marks (Fang marks) | Multiple small teeth marks (U-shape) |
| **Tail** | Compressed (Sea snake) or Tapering | Tapering |
| **Pupil** | Often vertical/elliptical (Vipers) or Round (Elapids) | Round |

### Pathology and Mode of Action (Venom)
Snake [[venom]] is modified saliva secreted by parotid-like glands. It is a complex mixture of enzymes, polypeptides, and proteins.

#### 1. Composition of Venom
*   **Enzymes:**
    *   **Hyaluronidase:** "Spreading factor"; breaks down connective tissue allowing rapid spread of venom.
    *   **Phospholipase A2:** Causes hemolysis, muscle necrosis, and presynaptic neurotoxicity.
    *   **Proteolytic enzymes:** Causes tissue destruction and necrosis (prominent in Vipers).
    *   **Cholinesterase:** Found in Cobra venom; degrades acetylcholine.
    *   **Procoagulants:** Activate clotting cascade leading to consumption coagulopathy.

#### 2. Mechanism of Toxicity
*   **Neurotoxic (Elapids):** Acts on the neuromuscular junction.
    *   *Post-synaptic block:* Cobra venom binds to acetylcholine receptors (Curare-like).
    *   *Pre-synaptic block:* Krait venom destroys nerve terminals preventing Acetylcholine release (more difficult to reverse).
*   **Vasculotoxic/Haemotoxic (Vipers):** Damages endothelial lining of blood vessels leading to hemorrhage. Consumes clotting factors (fibrinogen, platelets) causing Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation ([[DIC]]).
*   **Myotoxic (Sea Snakes):** Direct damage to muscle fibers causing [[rhabdomyolysis]] and myoglobinuria.

### Clinical Features

The clinical presentation depends on the species, amount of venom injected, and bite site. **Fear and psychological shock** are common even in non-poisonous bites.

#### 1. Elapidae Bite (Cobra and Krait) - Neurotoxic
*   **Local Signs:**
    *   *Cobra:* Slight burning pain, minimal swelling, reddish wheal at bite site.
    *   *Krait:* **Often painless**, no local swelling. Victim may not realize they were bitten (Occult bite).
*   **Systemic Signs (Neuroparalysis):**
    *   **[[Ptosis]]:** Drooping of eyelids (Earliest sign).
    *   **Ophthalmoplegia:** External eye muscle paralysis.
    *   **Bulbar Paralysis:** Difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia), slurred speech (dysarthria), inability to protrude tongue.
    *   **Broken Neck Sign:** Paralysis of neck muscles causing the head to fall forward.
    *   **Respiratory Paralysis:** Intercostal muscle and diaphragm paralysis leading to death (Asphyxia).
    *   *Note:* Krait bites often present with severe abdominal pain ("Krait colic").

#### 2. Viperidae Bite (Russell's and Saw-Scaled) - Haemotoxic
*   **Local Signs:** Intense pain, massive swelling (may spread to whole limb), blistering, and **necrosis** (gangrene) at the bite site.
*   **Systemic Signs (Hemorrhagic):**
    *   **Bleeding tendencies:** Epistaxis (nose bleed), gum bleeding, hematemesis, hematuria.
    *   **Incoagulable blood:** Blood fails to clot.
    *   **Renal Failure:** Oliguria/anuria due to acute tubular necrosis or cortical necrosis (Major cause of death in Russell's viper bite).
    *   **Shock:** Due to fluid loss into tissues and internal bleeding.
    *   **Pituitary Failure:** Sheehan-like syndrome (delayed complication of Russell's viper bite).

#### 3. Hydrophidae Bite (Sea Snake) - Myotoxic
*   **Local:** Little or no reaction.
*   **Systemic:** Generalized muscle pain/stiffness (myalgia), trismus, [[myoglobinuria]] (cola-colored urine), and renal failure.

### Diagnosis
*   **Clinical History:** Identification of snake if possible.
*   **[[20 Minute Whole Blood Clotting Test]] (20 WBCT):** Bedside test. Place 2ml venous blood in a clean glass tube. If it remains liquid after 20 minutes, it indicates incoagulable blood (Viper bite).
*   **ELISA:** For detection of specific venom antigens.

### First Aid Management

The primary goal is to retard venom absorption and transport the patient safely. Use the mnemonic **RIGHT**.

**R - Reassure:** 70% of snakebites are non-venomous; reassurance prevents psychogenic shock.
**I - Immobilize:** Completely immobilize the bitten limb using a splint or sling (like a fracture). Movement pumps venom into circulation.
**G - Go to Hospital:** Transport immediately. Do not waste time on traditional remedies.
**H - Hospital Management/History:** Tell the doctor about the snake description and symptoms.
**T - Tell Symptoms:** Report any systemic symptoms developed during transport.

**Specific First Aid Methods:**
1.  **Pressure Immobilization (Sutherland Wrap):** Recommended for **Neurotoxic (Elapid/Sea snake)** bites. Crepe bandage is applied over the bite site and the entire limb at a pressure comfortable enough to allow a finger to pass (50-70 mmHg). This occludes lymphatics but *not* arteries.
    *   *Caution:* Controversial in Viper bites as it may increase local necrosis.
2.  **No Interference:**
    *   **NO** Tourniquets (Causes gangrene/ischemia).
    *   **NO** Incision and Suction (Damages tendons/nerves, introduces infection).
    *   **NO** Washing the wound (Interferes with forensic venom detection).
    *   **NO** Ice packs or electric shocks.

### Hospital Management (Summary)

1.  **[[Anti-Snake Venom]] (ASV):**
    *   **Polyvalent ASV** is used in India (effective against Cobra, Krait, Russell's, Saw-scaled).
    *   **Indications:** Systemic envenomation (neurotoxicity, bleeding, shock, renal failure) or severe local swelling.
    *   **Dosage:** Initial dose 8-10 vials IV. Children receive the same dose as adults.
    *   **Anaphylaxis:** Treat reactions with Adrenaline (IM).
2.  **Neostigmine + Atropine:** Useful in **Cobra** bites (Post-synaptic block). Not effective in Krait or Viper bites.
3.  **Supportive:**
    *   **Ventilator** support for respiratory paralysis.
    *   **Dialysis** for renal failure.
    *   **Tetanus toxoid** and antibiotics.

### Autopsy Findings
*   **External:**
    *   **Fang Marks:** Usually two deep punctures. Viper bites show oozing blood and severe cellulitis/necrosis surrounding marks. Elapid bites may look like simple pinpricks.
    *   **Signs of Asphyxia:** Cyanosis (in neurotoxic deaths).
*   **Internal:**
    *   **Viperine:** Hemorrhages in organs (lungs, subendocardial, bowel), fluid blood (incoagulable), acute tubular necrosis in kidneys.
    *   **Elapine:** Congestion of organs, pulmonary edema. No specific organ damage except signs of asphyxia.

### Medicolegal Aspects
*   Mostly **Accidental** (farmers, laborers).
*   **Homicide:** Rare, but documented (e.g., throwing a snake on a sleeping person).
*   **Cattle Poisoning:** Using "Snake Venom Spikes" or introducing venom-soaked rags into the rectum of cattle.
