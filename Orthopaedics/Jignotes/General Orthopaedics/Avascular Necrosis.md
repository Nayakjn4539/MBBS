# [[Avascular Necrosis]] (Osteonecrosis)

[[Avascular Necrosis]] (AVN), also known as **osteonecrosis**, **aseptic necrosis**, or **ischemic necrosis**, is the cellular death of bone components due to the interruption of the blood supply. Without blood, the bone tissue dies and eventually collapses. If the [[avalsucular necrosis]] involves the bones of a joint, it often leads to destruction of the articular cartilage and subsequent [[osteoarthritis]].

### Common Sites of AVN
While AVN can occur in any bone, it most frequently affects bones with a precarious blood supply (retrograde blood supply) or limited collateral circulation.

| Bone/Site | Specific Condition/Eponym |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Head of Femur]]** | **Chandler’s Disease** (adults); **[[Perthes' Disease]]** (children) |
| **[[Proximal Pole of Scaphoid]]** | **Preiser’s Disease** (idiopathic) |
| **[[Lunate]]** | **Kienbock’s Disease** |
| **[[Body of Talus]]** | Following fracture neck of talus |
| **[[Navicular Bone]]** (Tarsal) | **Kohler’s Disease** |
| **[[Capitulum]]** (Humerus) | **Panner’s Disease** |
| **[[Metatarsal Head]]** (2nd/3rd) | **Freiberg’s Disease** |
| **[[Calcaneal Tuberosity]]** | **Sever’s Disease** |
| **[[Tibial Tubercle]]** | **[[Osgood-Schlatter Disease]]** |

### Etiology
The causes of [[osteonecrosis]] can be broadly classified into Traumatic and Non-traumatic.

#### 1. Traumatic Causes
Disruption of blood vessels due to injury is a primary cause.
*   **[[Fracture Neck of Femur]]**: The most common traumatic cause. Intra-capsular fractures disrupt the retinacular vessels supplying the head.
*   **[[Hip Dislocation]]**: Tearing of the ligamentum teres and capsular vessels.
*   **[[Scaphoid Fracture]]**: Fractures through the waist can isolate the proximal pole.
*   **[[Talus Fracture]]**: Fractures through the neck of the talus disrupt the blood supply to the body.

#### 2. Non-Traumatic Causes (Idiopathic/Secondary)
Often multifactorial.

**Mnemonic: SCLERA**
*   **S** – **[[Steroids]]** (Corticosteroids): High dosage (e.g., in transplant patients, asthma, SLE) is a potent cause.
*   **C** – **[[Caisson’s Disease]]** (Dysbarism): Seen in deep-sea divers due to nitrogen emboli blocking capillaries.
*   **L** – **[[Lupus Erythematosus]]** (SLE) and other vasculitis.
*   **E** – **[[Emboli]]** / Enzymes (Pancreatitis, Gaucher's disease).
*   **R** – **[[Radiation Therapy]]**.
*   **A** – **[[Alcoholism]]**: Long-standing alcohol abuse is a significant risk factor.

**Other causes include:**
*   **[[Sickle Cell Disease]]**: Marrow hyperplasia and sludging of sickled cells cause infarction.
*   **[[Gaucher’s Disease]]**: Accumulation of abnormal cells in marrow increases intraosseous pressure.
*   **[[Perthes' Disease]]**: Idiopathic AVN of femoral head in children.

### Pathology
The pathological process follows a predictable sequence (approx. 2–4 years).

1.  **Stage of Ischemia/Bone Death:** The bone dies but the inorganic structure remains. Radiographically, the bone looks normal initially. The lacunae are empty (no osteocytes).
2.  **Stage of Revascularization and Repair:** New blood vessels grow into the dead bone.
    *   **Creeping Substitution:** Osteoclasts remove dead bone while osteoblasts lay down new woven bone on the dead trabeculae.
    *   This leads to **increased radiographic density** (sclerosis) because there is more bone mass per unit volume (new bone + dead bone).
3.  **Stage of Distortion/Collapse:** The repairing bone is structurally weak (woven bone). Weight-bearing causes **subchondral fractures** and collapse of the articular surface.
4.  **Stage of Secondary Osteoarthritis:** Incongruity of the joint surface leads to degenerative changes.

### Clinical Features
*   **Onset:** Usually insidious (except in trauma).
*   **Pain:** The earliest symptom. In [[Hip AVN]], pain is felt in the **groin**, buttock, or referred to the **[[Knee]]**.
*   **Stiffness:** Progressive limitation of movement. In the hip, **[[Abduction]]** and **[[Internal Rotation]]** are restricted first.
*   **Limp:** Antalgic gait or Trendelenburg gait in late stages.
*   **Tenderness:** Deep tenderness over the affected joint.

### Diagnostic Imaging

#### 1. X-ray (Radiographs)
Changes appear late (months after onset).
*   **Increased Density (Sclerosis):** Cardinal feature. Due to new bone formation on dead trabeculae and relative osteoporosis of surrounding live bone.
*   **Cystic Changes:** Radiolucent areas in the metaphysis or subchondral region.
*   **[[Crescent Sign]]**: A subchondral radiolucent line indicating a subchondral fracture and imminent collapse.
*   **Deformity:** Flattening of the femoral head (Coxa Plana).
*   **Joint Space:** Usually preserved until late stages (unlike arthritis where it narrows early).

#### 2. Magnetic Resonance Imaging ([[MRI]])
*   **Gold Standard:** Most sensitive method for early diagnosis (before X-ray changes).
*   **Findings:** A characteristic low-signal (hypointense) band on T1-weighted images demarcating the necrotic segment. "Double line sign" on T2 images.

#### 3. Radionuclide Bone Scan
*   Shows a "cold spot" (photopenic area) early due to lack of blood flow.
*   Later shows a "hot spot" due to revascularization activity.

#### 4. CT Scan
*   Useful for assessing the extent of bone collapse and cortical depression.

### Staging (Ficat and Arlet Classification for Hip)
This is commonly used to guide treatment.

| Stage | Radiographic Findings | Clinical Features | Treatment Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I** | Normal X-ray. Edema on MRI. | Pain, no signs. | Prevent collapse |
| **II** | Sclerosis, cysts, or mixed osteopenia. Head contour normal. | Pain, stiffness. | Prevent collapse |
| **III** | **[[Crescent Sign]]** (Subchondral fracture). Flattening of head. | Pain, limp, limited ROM. | Preserve joint / Arthroplasty |
| **IV** | Joint space narrowing, secondary osteoarthritis. | Severe pain/disability. | Arthroplasty |

### Treatment
Treatment depends on the stage of the disease and the age of the patient.

#### 1. Conservative Management
*   **Indications:** Very early stages (Stage I), small lesions, or patients unfit for surgery.
*   **Methods:**
    *   **Rest and Non-Weight Bearing:** Using crutches to prevent collapse (limited success in adults).
    *   **[[Bisphosphonates]]** (e.g., Alendronate): To reduce osteoclastic bone resorption and prevent collapse.
    *   **Stop Etiological Factors:** Cessation of alcohol, smoking, or steroids (if possible).

#### 2. Joint Preserving Surgeries (Pre-Collapse)
Used in Stage I and II (and early Stage III) to save the femoral head.
*   **[[Core Decompression]]**: Drilling a channel into the necrotic area to reduce intraosseous pressure and stimulate vascularization. Often combined with bone grafting.
*   **[[Bone Grafting]]**:
    *   **Non-vascularized:** Cortical strut graft (Phemister technique).
    *   **Vascularized Fibular Grafting:** Transplanting a live fibula with its blood vessels to the necrotic area.
*   **[[Osteotomy]]**: Rotational osteotomy to move the necrotic segment away from the weight-bearing zone.

#### 3. Joint Replacement Surgeries (Post-Collapse)
Used in Stage III (late) and Stage IV when the joint is destroyed or painful.
*   **[[Hemiarthroplasty]]**: Replacement of the femoral head only (e.g., Austin Moore Prosthesis). Used in elderly patients with normal acetabulum.
*   **[[Total Hip Replacement]] (THR)**: Replacement of both femoral head and acetabulum. Best for active elderly patients or those with acetabular involvement.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Early Diagnosis is Key:** Once the bone collapses (Stage III), the success rate of joint-preserving procedures drops significantly. High index of suspicion is needed in patients on steroids or with hip trauma.
*   **Bilateral Involvement:** AVN is often bilateral (e.g., in alcoholics or steroid users). Always check the asymptomatic hip.
*   **[[Hawkin's Sign]]**: In talus fractures, a subchondral lucency on X-ray at 6-8 weeks indicates *intact* vascularity (resorption is occurring). Its **absence** suggests AVN.
