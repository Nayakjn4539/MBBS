# Painful Arc Syndrome

[[Painful Arc Syndrome]], often synonymous with or a manifestation of **Impingement Syndrome**, is a clinical condition characterized by pain in the shoulder and upper arm specifically during the mid-range of gleno-humeral abduction.

### Pathomechanics
The underlying mechanism involves mechanical **impingement** of the soft tissue structures located in the [[subacromial space]].

*   **Anatomy:** The subacromial space is bounded superiorly by the [[acromion process]], the [[coraco-acromial ligament]], and the [[acromioclavicular joint]]. Inferiorly lies the [[head of humerus]] and the [[greater tuberosity]].
*   **Contents:** The space contains the [[rotator cuff]] (specifically the [[supraspinatus tendon]]) and the [[subacromial bursa]].
*   **Mechanism:** During abduction, the greater tuberosity of the humerus passes under the coraco-acromial arch. In a healthy shoulder, there is sufficient clearance. However, if the soft tissue structures are swollen, inflamed, or if there is a bony abnormality (osteophyte), these structures get "pinched" or compressed between the greater tuberosity and the arch during the mid-range of movement.

### Etiology
Any condition increasing the volume of structures in the subacromial space or decreasing the space itself can cause this syndrome. Common causes include:

1.  **[[Supraspinatus tendinitis]]** (most common).
2.  **[[Subacromial bursitis]]** (chronic).
3.  **Minor tears** of the [[supraspinatus tendon]].
4.  **Inflammation** of the [[rotator cuff]].
5.  **[[Fracture of the greater tuberosity]]** (malunited, causing a bony prominence).

### Clinical Features
The diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on the characteristic pattern of pain during movement.

#### The Painful Arc Test
*   **0° to 60° (Abduction):** Movement is usually painless. The greater tuberosity has not yet reached the acromion.
*   **60° to 120° (Mid-range):** **Pain is elicited.** The swollen/tender tissues are compressed between the tuberosity and the acromial arch. The patient may wince or catch their breath.
*   **120° to 180° (Full Elevation):** The pain typically disappears or diminishes significantly. The greater tuberosity has passed under and cleared the acromion, relieving the compression.

**Clinical Implication:** If the patient cannot actively abduct due to pain, the examiner should perform passive abduction. If the pain is reproduced, it confirms impingement.

#### Other Signs
*   **Provocative Tests:** Moving the joint in a specific way calculated to produce impingement reproduces the patient's daily symptoms.
    *   **Neer's Impingement Sign:** Passive flexion of the arm while stabilizing the scapula.
    *   **Hawkins-Kennedy Test:** Passive internal rotation of the shoulder with the arm flexed to 90 degrees.

### Differential Diagnosis
It is crucial to differentiate this from other shoulder pathologies:
*   **[[Frozen Shoulder]] (Adhesive Capsulitis):** Characterized by restriction of *all* movements (global limitation), particularly external rotation, rather than a specific painful arc.
*   **[[Rotator Cuff Tear]]:** Often presents with weakness (drop arm sign) in addition to pain.
*   **[[Acromioclavicular Arthritis]]:** Pain is usually at the extreme of abduction (last 10-20 degrees) rather than mid-range.

### Management
Treatment depends on the severity and chronicity of the condition.

#### 1. Conservative Management
This is the first line of defense and is effective in most cases.
*   **Physiotherapy:** Ultrasonic therapy to reduce inflammation. Exercises to strengthen the rotator cuff (depressors of the humeral head) to prevent upward migration and impingement.
*   **Medication:** [[NSAIDs]] (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) to reduce pain and inflammation.
*   **Local Injection:** Infiltration of **[[hydrocortisone]]** (steroid) into the subacromial space. This is useful if a localized tender spot or trigger point is identified.

#### 2. Surgical Management
Indicated if conservative measures fail after a prolonged period (usually 3-6 months) or if there is a specific anatomical mechanical block.
*   **[[Acromioplasty]]:** Excision of the anterior, prominent, or hooked part of the acromion to decompress the subacromial space. This can be done open or arthroscopically (Subacromial Decompression).
*   **Excision of Osteophytes:** If present on the acromioclavicular joint.
