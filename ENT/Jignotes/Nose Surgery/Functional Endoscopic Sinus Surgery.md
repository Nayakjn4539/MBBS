# [[Nose Surgery]] > Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery

### **Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS)**

**Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS)** is a minimally invasive surgical technique used to treat chronic sinonasal diseases. It is based on the principle of restoring physiological drainage and ventilation of the paranasal sinuses by removing disease from the key area known as the [[Ostiomeatal complex]] (OMC), while preserving healthy mucosa and normal anatomical structures.

---

### **Physiological Principle**
*   **Mucociliary Clearance:** The mucus from the sinuses drains into the nasal cavity via specific pathways. For the anterior group of sinuses (Maxillary, Frontal, Anterior Ethmoids), drainage occurs through the [[Ostiomeatal complex]] in the middle meatus.
*   **Goal:** By clearing obstructions in the OMC (like polyps or anatomical blocks), normal mucociliary flow is re-established, allowing the sinus mucosa to revert to normal. This reversibility is the basis of the term "Functional".

---

### **Indications**
FESS is primarily indicated when medical therapy fails.

**1. Inflammatory Conditions:**
*   [[Chronic Rhinosinusitis]] (CRS) refractory to medical treatment.
*   Recurrent acute rhinosinusitis.
*   [[Nasal Polyposis]] (e.g., Ethmoidal polyps, Antrochoanal polyp).
*   [[Allergic Fungal Rhinosinusitis]] (AFRS) and Fungal balls.
*   Mucocele of frontoethmoid or sphenoid sinus.

**2. Extended Applications (Beyond Sinusitis):**
*   **Orbital:** Endoscopic Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR), Orbital decompression (e.g., for Graves' ophthalmopathy), Drainage of orbital abscess.
*   **Skull Base:** Repair of [[Cerebrospinal Fluid Rhinorrhea]] (CSF leak), Pituitary surgery (Endoscopic trans-sphenoidal hypophysectomy).
*   **Others:** Control of posterior [[Epistaxis]] (Sphenopalatine artery ligation), Removal of foreign bodies, Excision of benign tumors (e.g., Inverted Papilloma, Angiofibroma).

---

### **Contraindications**
While FESS is versatile, certain conditions may require open approaches:
*   **Absolute/Relative:** Impending intracranial complications, Osteomyelitis of the skull base, and aggressive fungal infections like extensive [[Mucormycosis]] (though endoscopic debridement is often part of the management).
*   **Technical:** Orbital cellulitis with visual field defects or massive tumors extending beyond endoscopic reach.

---

### **Preoperative Evaluation**
**1. Diagnostic Nasal Endoscopy (DNE):**
*   Assesses the extent of polyps, discharge, and anatomical variations (e.g., [[Deviated Nasal Septum]], Concha bullosa).

**2. Computed Tomography (CT Scan):**
*   **Gold Standard:** Non-contrast CT (Coronal cuts) is the "Road Map" for surgery.
*   **Purpose:** Evaluates the extent of disease and identifies dangerous anatomical variations to prevent complications.

> **Mnemonic for CT Evaluation: CLOSE**
> *   **C:** **C**ribriform plate (Check for depth/asymmetry to avoid CSF leak).
> *   **L:** **L**amina papyracea (Check for dehiscence to avoid orbital injury).
> *   **O:** **O**nodi cell (Sphenoethmoidal cell; risk to Optic nerve).
> *   **S:** **S**phenoid sinus (Pneumatization and carotid artery relation).
> *   **E:** **E**thmoidal arteries (Anterior/Posterior positions to avoid bleeding).

### **Surgical Techniques**
There are two main approaches:
1.  **Messerklinger Technique (Anterior to Posterior):** Most common. Surgery proceeds from the uncinate process backward to the sphenoid.
2.  **Wigand Technique (Posterior to Anterior):** Surgery starts at the sphenoid and proceeds anteriorly; often used for extensive polyposis.

### **Steps of FESS (Messerklinger Approach)**

**1. Preparation and Anesthesia:**
*   Usually performed under General Anesthesia (preferred) or Local Anesthesia with sedation.
*   Topical vasoconstriction and infiltration with Lignocaine + Adrenaline (1:100,000) to minimize bleeding.

**2. Uncinectomy (Infundibulotomy):**
*   **First and most important step.**
*   The [[Uncinate process]] is incised and removed. This exposes the infundibulum and the natural ostium of the maxillary sinus.

**3. Middle Meatal Antrostomy (MMA):**
*   The natural ostium of the [[Maxillary sinus]] is identified and enlarged (usually posteriorly and inferiorly) to improve drainage.
*   **Note:** Accessory ostia, if present, should be joined with the natural ostium to prevent recirculation of mucus.

**4. Anterior Ethmoidectomy:**
*   The [[Bulla ethmoidalis]] (largest anterior ethmoid cell) is entered and removed.
*   Anterior ethmoid cells are exenterated up to the skull base (fovea ethmoidalis) and laterally to the lamina papyracea.

**5. Frontal Recess Clearance:**
*   Performed if there is frontal sinus disease. The cells obstructing the frontal recess (e.g., Agger nasi cells) are cleared to ventilate the [[Frontal sinus]].

**6. Posterior Ethmoidectomy:**
*   The basal lamella of the [[Middle turbinate]] is perforated to enter the posterior ethmoids. These cells are cleared back to the face of the sphenoid.

**7. Sphenoidotomy:**
*   The [[Sphenoid sinus]] is opened by enlarging its natural ostium located in the sphenoethmoidal recess.

### **Postoperative Care**
*   **Packing:** Nasal packs (e.g., Merocel) may be placed to control bleeding and removed after 24 hours.
*   **Medication:** Antibiotics (7-10 days), Analgesics, and Antihistamines if allergic.
*   **Nasal Toileting:**
    *   **Saline Irrigation:** Essential to remove clots/crusts and prevent infection.
    *   **Endoscopic Debridement:** Done at follow-up visits to remove crusts and prevent adhesions (synechiae).
*   **Mitomycin C:** A pack infused with **Mitomycin C** may be placed in the middle meatus to prevent synechiae formation.

### **Complications of FESS**
Complications usually result from injury to surrounding vital structures (Orbit and Brain).

| **Category** | **Complications** | **Clinical Implication** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Major (Orbital)** | Orbital Hematoma | Emergency! Can cause blindness due to optic nerve compression. Requires lateral canthotomy. |
| | Injury to Optic Nerve | Blindness. Most feared complication. |
| | Diplopia | Due to injury to extraocular muscles (Medial Rectus). |
| | Injury to Nasolacrimal Duct | Epiphora. |
| **Major (Intracranial)** | CSF Leak (Rhinorrhea) | Due to injury to Cribriform plate or fovea ethmoidalis. |
| | Meningitis / Brain Abscess | Secondary to CSF leak. |
| | Internal Carotid Artery Injury | Fatal hemorrhage (Associated with sphenoid surgery/Onodi cells). |
| **Minor** | Hemorrhage | Most common complication. |
| | Synechiae (Adhesions) | Between turbinates and lateral wall; causes obstruction. |
| | Periorbital Ecchymosis | "Black eye" due to minor breach of lamina papyracea. |

**Clinical Implication:**
*   **Onodi Cells:** Posterior ethmoid cells that extend posteriorly alongside the sphenoid sinus. They are closely related to the **Optic Nerve** and **Internal Carotid Artery**. Failure to recognize them on CT can lead to catastrophic injury to these structures.
