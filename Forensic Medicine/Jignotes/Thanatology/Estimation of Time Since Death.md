# [[Thanatology]] > Estimation of Time Since Death

### Estimation of Time Since Death (Post Mortem Interval)

The estimation of the time since death, also known as the [[Post Mortem Interval]] (PMI), is one of the most difficult and critical challenges in forensic medicine. It is not an exact science but an **estimate** based on the evaluation of various changes that occur in the body after death. The longer the interval, the wider the range of the estimate.

### **Medicolegal Importance**
1.  **Alibi Verification:** To confirm or refute the statement of suspects regarding their whereabouts at the time of the crime.
2.  **Identification:** Helps in narrowing down the list of missing persons.
3.  **Legal Issues:** Inheritance and insurance claims often depend on the precise time of death (e.g., in [[Commorientes]]).

### **Methods of Estimation**

The determination of PMI depends on the progression of physical, chemical, and biological changes.

#### **1. Cooling of the Body ([[Algor Mortis]])**
This is one of the most reliable methods for estimating early PMI.
*   **Mechanism:** The body loses heat by radiation, conduction, and convection until it reaches equilibrium with the environmental temperature.
*   **Curve:** The rate of cooling follows a **Sigmoid (Inverse 'S' shaped)** curve, not a straight line.
    *   *Plateau phase:* Body temp remains stable for initial 0.5–1 hour.
    *   *Linear phase:* Rapid fall in temperature.
    *   *Terminal phase:* Slow cooling as body temp approaches ambient temp.
*   **Recording:** Temperature is recorded using a chemical thermometer (25 cm long) or a thermocouple inserted into the **rectum** (proctometer), sub-hepatic space, or nose.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   **Normal Rate of Cooling:** In tropical climates, the body cools at approximately **0.5°C to 0.7°C per hour**.
    *   **Formula:**
        $$
        \text{Time Since Death (hours)} = \frac{\text{Normal Body Temp} - \text{Rectal Temp}}{\text{Rate of Cooling}}
        $$
*   **Factors Affecting Cooling:**
    *   *Body Build:* Children and thin subjects cool faster (larger surface area to mass ratio).
    *   *Clothing:* Insulates and retards cooling.
    *   *Medium:* Cooling in water is 2x faster than air.

#### **2. Post Mortem Staining ([[Livor Mortis]])**
Useful for estimating PMI in the first 24 hours.
*   **0.5 to 1 hour:** Staining begins as mottled patches.
*   **4 to 6 hours:** Patches coalesce to form uniform staining.
*   **6 to 12 hours:** Staining becomes **Fixed**.
    *   *Test:* Application of thumb pressure. If the area blanches (turns pale), lividity is *unfixed*. If it remains colored, it is *fixed*.
    *   **Significance:** Fixation indicates death occurred approx. 6–12 hours prior.

#### **3. [[Rigor Mortis]] (Cadaveric Rigidity)**
The stiffening of muscles due to ATP depletion. In India (tropical climate), the timeline is accelerated compared to temperate zones.

**The "Rule of 12" (March of Rigor)**
| Phase | Duration | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Onset** | 1–2 hours | Starts in eyelids, jaw, neck ([[Nysten's Law]]). |
| **Development** | 12 hours | Rigor spreads to limbs (Head to Toe). Body is stiff. |
| **Maintenance** | 12 hours | Body remains stiff. |
| **Resolution** | 12 hours | Rigor passes off (due to autolysis) in the same order (Head to Toe). |

**Mnemonic for Rigor Mortis Timing:**
**"12-12-12"**
*   **12** hours to develop.
*   **12** hours to stay.
*   **12** hours to pass away.
*(Note: In very hot summers in India, these phases may shorten to 6-9 hours each).*

#### **4. Changes in the Eyes**
*   **[[Cornea]]:**
    *   *Eyes Open:* Hazy in **2–4 hours**; Opaque in **6 hours**.
    *   *Eyes Closed:* Hazy in **24 hours**; Opaque in **48 hours**.
*   **[[Tache Noire]]:** A brownish-triangular discoloration on the sclera (exposed to air) develops within **3–6 hours** if eyes are left open.
*   **Vitreous Potassium ([[Vitreous Humor]]):**
    *   This is one of the most accurate methods for the first few days.
    *   There is a linear rise in potassium concentration in the vitreous humor after death due to leakage from retinal cells.
    *   **Sturner’s Formula:**
        $$
        \text{PMI (hours)} = 7.14 \times (\text{Potassium concentration in mEq/L} - 39.1)
        $$

#### **5. Gastric Contents**
This helps link death to the last known meal.
*   **General Rule:**
    *   Semi-digested food: Death ~ **2–3 hours** after meal.
    *   Empty stomach: Death ~ **4–6 hours** after meal.
*   *Limitations:* Emotional stress, head injury, or shock can stop peristalsis (pylorospasm), preserving food in the stomach for days.

#### **6. Decomposition ([[Putrefaction]])**
Used for late estimation of PMI (days to weeks).

**Chronology of Decomposition (In India/Warm Climates):**
| Time Since Death | Feature | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **12–24 hours** | Greenish discoloration | [[Sulfhaemoglobin]] formation in Right Iliac Fossa. |
| **24–36 hours** | [[Marbling]] | Staining of superficial veins (arborescent pattern). |
| **24–48 hours** | Bloating/Swelling | Gas accumulation; facial distortion. |
| **2–3 days** | Skin Slippage / Blisters | Epidermis separates from dermis. |
| **3–5 days** | Colliquative Putrefaction | Liquefaction of soft tissues; maggots appear. |

**Casper’s Dictum (Rate of Putrefaction):**
A body decomposes at the same rate in:
*   **1** week in **Air**
*   **2** weeks in **Water**
*   **8** weeks in **Earth** (Buried)
*(Ratio 1:2:8)*

#### **7. Forensic [[Entomology]] (Insect Activity)**
*   Most useful for decomposed bodies (72+ hours).
*   **Flies involved:** *Calliphora* (Blue bottle), *Musca domestica* (House fly).
*   **Life Cycle:** Egg $\rightarrow$ Larva (Maggot) $\rightarrow$ Pupa $\rightarrow$ Adult Fly.
*   By identifying the oldest maggot stage and the species, the minimum time since death can be calculated.
