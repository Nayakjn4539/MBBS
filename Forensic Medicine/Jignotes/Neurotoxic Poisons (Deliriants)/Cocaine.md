# [[Neurotoxic Poisons (Deliriants)]] > Cocaine

### Cocaine
**Synonyms:** Methyl benzoyl ecgonine, Coke, Snow, Crack, White Lady, Cadillac, Gold dust.

Cocaine is a natural alkaloid obtained from the leaves of the **Coca plant** (*Erythroxylum coca*), extensively grown in South America (Peru, Bolivia). It is a potent **CNS stimulant** and a local anesthetic.

#### 1. Physical Appearance and Forms
*   **Pure Alkaloid:** Colorless, odorless, transparent prisms. Bitter taste.
*   **Cocaine Hydrochloride:** White crystalline powder (snorted or injected).
*   **Crack:** Freebase form of cocaine. Prepared by heating cocaine HCl with baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and water. It produces a crackling sound when smoked.
*   **Coca Paste:** Crude extract, usually smoked.

#### 2. Mode of Action
*   **Local Action:** It is the only local anesthetic that causes **vasoconstriction**. It blocks nerve conduction by stabilizing axonal membranes (blocking sodium channels).
*   **Systemic Action:** It blocks the reuptake of neurotransmitters **[[Dopamine]]**, **Norepinephrine**, and **Serotonin** at the presynaptic terminal.
    *   Accumulation of Dopamine $\rightarrow$ Euphoria and addiction.
    *   Accumulation of Norepinephrine $\rightarrow$ Sympathetic overdrive (Tachycardia, Hypertension).
*   **Stimulation Pattern:** It stimulates the CNS from **rostral to caudal** (Cortex $\rightarrow$ Midbrain $\rightarrow$ Medulla $\rightarrow$ Spinal cord).

#### 3. Clinical Features (Acute Poisoning)
The clinical presentation is often described in three stages:

| Stage | Symptoms and Signs |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Stage of Euphoria (Early)** | • Sense of well-being, increased energy, talkativeness.<br>• **Mydriasis** (dilated pupils).<br>• Tachycardia, hypertension.<br>• Dry mouth, sweating. |
| **Stage of Excitement (Advanced)** | • Vomiting, tremors, hyperreflexia.<br>• **Hyperpyrexia** (Cocaine fever).<br>• Hallucinations (Visual, Auditory, Tactile).<br>• Convulsions (Generalized tonic-clonic). |
| **Stage of Depression** | • Respiratory depression (Cheyne-Stokes breathing).<br>• Coma, flaccid paralysis.<br>• Death due to respiratory or cardiac failure. |

**Important Complications:**
*   **Cardiac:** [[Myocardial Infarction]] (even in young healthy hearts due to coronary vasospasm), Arrhythmias (Ventricular fibrillation).
*   **Cerebrovascular:** Subarachnoid hemorrhage, Stroke.
*   **Hyperthermia & [[Rhabdomyolysis]]:** Can lead to acute renal failure.

#### 4. Chronic Poisoning ([[Cocainism]])
Seen in habitual users. Characterized by:
1.  **Magnan’s Symptom (Cocaine Bugs):** A tactile hallucination where the addict feels as if grains of sand or insects are crawling under the skin (**Formication**).
2.  **Jet Black Tongue/Teeth:** Due to necrotic changes or pigment deposition.
3.  **Nasal Septum Perforation:** Seen in chronic snorters due to intense vasoconstriction causing ischemic necrosis of the septal cartilage.
4.  **Cocaine Insanity:** Paranoid delusions, often leading to violence.
5.  **Anorexia and Emaciation:** Due to appetite suppression.

#### 5. Special Syndromes

**A. Body Packer Syndrome (Mules)**
*   Smugglers swallow drug-filled packets (condoms/balloons) to transport them across borders.
*   **Risk:** Rupture of a packet leads to massive absorption and rapid death (Acute Cocaine Toxicity).
*   **Diagnosis:** Abdominal X-ray or CT scan showing foreign bodies ("Tick-tac-toe" sign or "Double condom" sign).
*   > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Sketch showing multiple oval packets visible in the abdominal X-ray or CT scan of the abdomen

**B. Body Stuffer Syndrome**
*   Individuals swallow small amounts of loosely wrapped drugs hastily to avoid arrest when confronted by police.
*   High risk of packet leakage and toxicity compared to packers.

**C. Speed Ball**
*   A combination of **Cocaine** (CNS Stimulant) and **[[Heroin]]** (CNS Depressant) injected intravenously.
*   They are taken together to blunt the side effects of each other, but the combination is highly lethal.

**D. Crack Thumb**
*   Callus formation on the thumb due to the repetitive use of butane lighters during crack smoking.

#### 6. Fatal Dose and Period
*   **Fatal Dose:** 
    *   Oral: **1 to 1.5 grams**.
    *   Mucosal application: **100 mg**.
    *   Fatal blood level: **> 0.2 mg%**.
    *   *Note:* Addicts may tolerate much higher doses due to tolerance.
*   **Fatal Period:** Few minutes to a few hours. (Usually rapid).

#### 7. Treatment
There is no specific antidote. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
1.  **Decontamination:** Gastric lavage with activated charcoal (if ingested).
2.  **Control of CNS Excitation:** **[[Benzodiazepines]]** (Diazepam/Lorazepam) are the mainstay to treat agitation and seizures.
3.  **Cooling:** Aggressive external cooling for hyperthermia.
4.  **Cardiovascular:**
    *   Treat Hypertension: Sodium Nitroprusside or Phentolamine.
    *   Treat Arrhythmias: Lidocaine.
    *   **Beta-blockers are contraindicated** (they leave alpha-adrenergic stimulation unopposed, worsening hypertension and vasoconstriction).
5.  **Amyl Nitrite:** Historically mentioned as a physiological antidote (by inhalation) to cause vasodilation, countering cocaine's vasoconstriction.

#### 8. Autopsy Findings
*   **External:**
    *   Signs of asphyxia.
    *   Needle marks/track marks (often tattooed over to hide them).
    *   Ulceration of nasal septum.
    *   Black discoloration of tongue/teeth.
*   **Internal:**
    *   Congestion of viscera.
    *   **Heart:** May show focal myocarditis, fibrosis, or contraction band necrosis.
    *   **Lungs:** Pulmonary edema; "Crack lung" (hemorrhagic alveolitis) in smokers.
    *   Stomach: May contain swallowed packets (Body packer).

#### 9. Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Accidental:** Most common (overdose in addicts, body packer rupture).
*   **Suicidal/Homicidal:** Rare.
*   **Date Rape Drug:** Occasionally used to lower inhibitions.
*   Included under the **NDPS Act** (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act) in India.

#### 10. Mnemonics for Exam

**Symptoms of Cocaine: "C-O-C-A-I-N-E"**
*   **C**: Cardiac arrhythmias/Chest pain
*   **O**: Overheating (Hyperthermia)
*   **C**: Convulsions
*   **A**: Anxiety/Agitation
*   **I**: Irrational behavior
*   **N**: Nose bleeds/Nasal perforation
*   **E**: Enlarged pupils (Mydriasis)
