# Sialadenitis

[[Sialadenitis]] is the inflammation of the salivary glands. It can be acute, chronic, or recurrent and may affect the major ([[Parotid gland]], [[Submandibular gland]], [[Sublingual gland]]) or minor salivary glands. The parotid gland is the most frequently involved gland in inflammation.

### Classification of Sialadenitis

1.  **Based on Duration:**
    *   Acute (e.g., Mumps, Acute suppurative sialadenitis)
    *   Chronic (e.g., Chronic recurrent sialadenitis, Sialolithiasis)
2.  **Based on Etiology:**
    *   **Infective:**
        *   Viral (e.g., [[Mumps]], HIV, Cytomegalovirus)
        *   Bacterial (e.g., *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Streptococcus*)
        *   Granulomatous (e.g., Tuberculosis, Actinomycosis)
    *   **Non-infective/Obstructive:**
        *   [[Sialolithiasis]] (Calculi)
        *   Strictures
    *   **Autoimmune:**
        *   [[Sjögren’s syndrome]]

### 1. Acute Viral Sialadenitis (Mumps)

[[Mumps]] is an acute viral parotitis caused by the **Paramyxovirus** (RNA virus). It is the most common cause of non-suppurative acute sialadenitis.

*   **Epidemiology:** Mostly affects children (5–15 years); highly contagious. Spread by droplet infection and fomites.
*   **Incubation Period:** 2–3 weeks (average 17–18 days).
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Prodrome:** Fever, malaise, headache, myalgia.
    *   **Parotid Swelling:** Tense, firm, and tender swelling obliterating the retroauricular sulcus. Displacement of the pinna outwards and upwards.
    *   **Bilaterality:** Usually starts on one side; the other gland enlarges within 1–5 days in 75% of cases.
    *   **Pain:** Exacerbated by chewing or tasting sour liquids.
    *   **Orifice:** The opening of [[Stensen's duct]] may be congested.

*   **Complications:**
    *   [[Orchitis]] and Oophoritis (may lead to sterility, though rare).
    *   Aseptic [[Meningitis]] / Encephalitis.
    *   [[Pancreatitis]].
    *   Unilateral Sensorineural Hearing Loss ([[SNHL]]).
    *   Thyroiditis, Myocarditis, Nephritis.

*   **Treatment:** Symptomatic and supportive (bed rest, hydration, analgesics). Antibiotics are not effective.

### 2. Acute Suppurative Sialadenitis

This is an acute bacterial infection, most commonly involving the **[[Parotid gland]]**. Unlike the submandibular gland, parotid saliva is serous and deficient in mucins (glycoproteins) that inhibit bacterial attachment, making it more prone to ascending infection.

**Etiology & Risk Factors:**
*   **Organisms:** **[[Staphylococcus aureus]]** (most common), *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *H. influenzae*, Anaerobes.
*   **Route:** Retrograde migration of bacteria from the oral cavity via the duct.
*   **Predisposing Factors:** "Surgical Mumps"
    *   Dehydration/Hypovolemia (Post-operative, debilitated elderly).
    *   Poor oral hygiene.
    *   Drugs causing [[Xerostomia]] (Anticholinergics, Diuretics, Antihistamines).
    *   Ductal obstruction (Stones/Strictures).

**Clinical Features:**
*   **Onset:** Sudden onset of severe pain and diffuse swelling of the gland.
*   **Systemic:** High fever, chills, toxemia.
*   **Local Signs:**
    *   Gland is tender, warm, and indurated.
    *   Skin over the gland is red and shiny (erythema).
    *   **Milking the gland** produces **frank pus** from the duct orifice (Stensen’s or Wharton’s).

**Treatment:**
1.  **Medical (First line):**
    *   **Aggressive Hydration:** IV fluids.
    *   **IV Antibiotics:** Antistaphylococcal coverage (Penicillinase-resistant).
    *   **Sialogogues:** Lemon drops/orange juice to stimulate saliva.
    *   **Local measures:** Warm compresses, gland massage (if tolerated).
    *   **Oral hygiene**.
2.  **Surgical:**
    *   If no improvement or fluctuation occurs, **Incision and Drainage (I&D)** is required.
    *   **Technique:** Hilton’s method. A modification of the Blair incision (preauricular) is used. Skin flap raised, and abscess drained by blunt dissection horizontally (parallel to facial nerve branches) to avoid nerve injury.

**Clinical Implications:**
> Never wait for fluctuation to appear in parotid abscess because the thick parotid fascia (parotido-masseteric fascia) prevents palpable fluctuation until very late. Delay can lead to rupture into the external auditory canal or spread to the [[Parapharyngeal space]].

### 3. Chronic Sialadenitis

Chronic inflammation usually resulting from salivary stasis due to obstruction.

**Etiology:**
*   **[[Sialolithiasis]]** (Stones) - most common cause.
*   Strictures of the duct.
*   Scarring from previous injury or surgery.

**Pathology:**
*   Dilatation of the ductal system (Sialectasis).
*   Acinar destruction and atrophy.
*   Lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis.

**Clinical Features:**
*   Recurrent unilateral swelling and tenderness, particularly **after eating** (Mealtime syndrome).
*   Gland feels firm/hard.
*   Scant or purulent saliva may be expressed.

**Diagnosis:**
*   **Sialography:** Shows "Sialectasis" (dilatation) – described as punctate, globular, or cavitary (snowstorm appearance). *Note: Contraindicated in acute infection*.
*   **Ultrasound/CT:** To rule out stones/masses.

**Treatment:**
*   Conservative: Hydration, massage, sialogogues.
*   Surgical: Removal of stone (if present). If the gland is functionally destroyed or symptoms persist, **excision of the gland** (Parotidectomy or Submandibular gland excision) is indicated.

### 4. Sialolithiasis (Salivary Calculi)

Formation of stones within the salivary duct or gland parenchyma.

**Distribution:**
*   **[[Submandibular Gland]]:** 80–90% (Most Common).
*   **Parotid Gland:** 10–20%.
*   **Sublingual:** ~1%.

**Why Submandibular? (The 3 'A's of Sialolithiasis)**
1.  **A**lkaline saliva (High pH favors calcium precipitation).
2.  **A**ntigravity flow (Wharton’s duct ascends vertically).
3.  **A**natomy (Long, tortuous, and wide duct; Viscous mucinous saliva).

**Composition:**
*   Inorganic: Calcium phosphate and carbonate.
*   Organic: Mucin, cellular debris.
*   **Radiopacity:** 80–90% of submandibular stones are radio-opaque; many parotid stones are radiolucent.

**Clinical Presentation:**
*   **Salivary Colic:** Acute, painful swelling of the gland during or immediately after meals.
*   Swelling gradually subsides after 1-2 hours.
*   Palpable stone in the floor of the mouth or cheek.

**Investigation:**
*   **X-ray Occlusal View:** Good for floor of mouth stones.
*   **Ultrasound:** Non-invasive, detects radiolucent stones.
*   **Sialography:** Gold standard for ductal anatomy but invasive.
*   **Sialoendoscopy:** Diagnostic and therapeutic.

**Management:**
| Stone Location | Management Strategy |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Distal Duct (near orifice)** | Intraoral removal (Ductotomy/Meatotomy) or Milking out. |
| **Proximal Duct/Hilum** | Sialoendoscopy (basket retrieval) or Combined approach. |
| **Intraglandular** | Sialoendoscopy / Lithotripsy. If gland is damaged: Gland Excision (Sialadenectomy). |

*   **Age:** 8 months to 16 years.
*   **Clinical:** Recurrent episodes of unilateral/bilateral painful parotid swelling with fever.
*   **Pathology:** "Sialectasis" (dilation of ducts) seen on imaging.

*   **Risk:** Increased risk of B-cell **Lymphoma** (MALT type).
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   **Biopsy:** Labial (minor salivary gland) biopsy showing lymphocytic infiltration.
    *   **Serology:** Anti-SS-A (Ro) and Anti-SS-B (La) antibodies.
    *   **Schirmer’s Test:** Reduced tear production.

#### C. Granulomatous Sialadenitis
*   **Tuberculosis:** Can present as acute abscess or chronic tumor-like mass. Diagnosed by FNAC (AFB) or biopsy.
*   **Sarcoidosis (Heerfordt’s Syndrome):** Uveoparotid fever triad of Parotid enlargement, Uveitis, and Facial nerve palsy.
*   **Actinomycosis:** Chronic suppuration with sinus tracts discharging "sulfur granules".

#### D. HIV-Associated Sialadenitis
*   Presents as cystic enlargement of parotid glands (Lymphoepithelial cysts).
*   Associated with generalized lymphadenopathy.
