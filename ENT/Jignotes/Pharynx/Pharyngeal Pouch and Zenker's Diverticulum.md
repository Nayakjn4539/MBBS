# [[Pharynx]] > Pharyngeal Pouch and Zenker's Diverticulum

# Pharyngeal Pouch ([[Zenker's Diverticulum]])

## Introduction and Definition
*   **Definition:** A [[Zenker's diverticulum]] (or pharyngeal pouch) is a propulsion/pulsion outpouching of the pharyngeal mucosa through a weak area in the posterior pharyngeal wall,.
*   **Nature:** It is a **false diverticulum** because it contains only mucosa and lamina propria (epithelium), lacking the muscular layer found in a true diverticulum,.
*   **Demographics:** Usually affects elderly patients (>60 years),.
*   **Laterality:** More common on the left side,.

## Surgical Anatomy
### Site of Origin: [[Killian's Dehiscence]]
The pouch herniates through a potentially weak area in the posterior wall of the [[hypopharynx]] known as [[Killian's dehiscence]] (also called the "Gateway of Tears" due to perforation risk),,.

**Boundaries of Killian's Dehiscence:**
*   **Superiorly:** The oblique fibers of the [[thyropharyngeus]] muscle (part of the inferior constrictor),.
*   **Inferiorly:** The transverse fibers of the [[cricopharyngeus]] muscle (part of the inferior constrictor),.

### Pathophysiology
*   **Mechanism:** It is a **pulsion diverticulum** caused by increased intraluminal pressure.
*   **Neuromuscular Incoordination:** The primary etiology is believed to be incoordination between the pharyngeal contraction and the relaxation of the [[cricopharyngeal sphincter]] during swallowing,. The sphincter may fail to relax or close prematurely while the thyropharyngeus is contracting to push food down.
*   **Progression:** The mucosa herniates posteriorly. As it enlarges, the pouch sags downwards behind the esophagus (retro-esophageal) and may eventually deviate to the left side,. When filled with food, it compresses the esophagus anteriorly, causing obstruction.

## Clinical Features
### Symptoms
*   **[[Dysphagia]]:** Usually the presenting symptom. Initially to solids, then liquids. Obstruction occurs when the pouch fills and compresses the esophagus,,.
*   **Regurgitation:** Spontaneous regurgitation of **undigested food** eaten hours earlier, often occurring at night or upon lying down,,.
*   **Halitosis:** Foul breath due to food stagnation and decomposition within the pouch,.
*   **Respiratory Symptoms:** Nocturnal coughing, hoarseness, and recurrent chest infections (aspiration),.
*   **Weight Loss:** Due to malnutrition from dysphagia,.

### Signs
*   **Neck Mass:** A soft, compressible swelling may be palpable in the lower neck, usually on the left side,.
*   **[[Boyce Sign]]:** A gurgling sound (borborygmi) elicited upon palpation of the neck swelling,.
*   **McEwan's Sign:** Splash sound heard on auscultation over the neck when the patient swallows fluids (rarely used now).

### Clinical Implications
*   **"Gateway of Tears":** The wall of the pouch is thin (mucosa only). During endoscopy or nasogastric intubation, the instrument tends to enter the pouch rather than the esophageal lumen, carrying a high risk of **perforation**,. Blind intubation is contraindicated.

**Mnemonic for Symptoms: ZENKER**
*   **Z**enker’s pouch (Posterior herniation)
*   **E**lderly patients / **E**at poorly (Dysphagia)
*   **N**octurnal regurgitation/cough
*   **K**illian's Dehiscence (Site)
*   **E**sophagus compressed
*   **R**otten smell (Halitosis)

## Complications
*   **Aspiration Pneumonia:** Lung abscess and recurrent infections due to spillover of contents into the airway,,.
*   **Malnutrition:** Severe weight loss.
*   **Carcinoma:** Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) develops in approximately 1% of cases due to chronic irritation,,.
*   **Perforation:** Iatrogenic (during endoscopy) or spontaneous.
*   **Hemorrhage:** Rare.

## Investigations
### Imaging
*   **[[Barium Swallow]] (Contrast Swallow):** The **Gold Standard** investigation,,.
    *   **Findings:** Demonstrates a contrast-filled sac posterior to the esophagus at the level of C6,.
    *   **Views:** Best seen on the **lateral view**,.
    *   **Appearance:** Shows the size, position, and non-relaxation of the cricopharyngeus. Large pouches may show pooling of barium.
*   **Video Fluoroscopy:** Useful to assess swallowing dynamics and aspiration.
*   **Chest X-ray:** May show aspiration pneumonia or a fluid level in the neck/mediastinum in very large pouches.

### Endoscopy
*   **Flexible/Rigid Oesophagoscopy:**
    *   *Caution:* Must be performed with extreme care due to perforation risk. The pouch opening is often wider than the esophageal inlet, making accidental entry likely.
    *   *Purpose:* To inspect the mucosa for malignancy or ulceration.

## Differential Diagnosis
*   [[Esophageal Web]] (Plummer-Vinson Syndrome),.
*   Esophageal Stricture (Benign or Malignant).
*   [[Achalasia Cardia]].
*   [[Pharyngocele]] (Lateral outpouching).
*   Extrinsic compression (e.g., Thyroid enlargement).

## Management / Treatment
Treatment depends on the size of the pouch and the severity of symptoms.

### 1. Conservative Management
*   Indicated for very small, asymptomatic pouches.
*   Assurance and observation,.

### 2. Surgical Management (Open Approach)
*   **Indications:** Large pouches, anatomical difficulties preventing endoscopy, or suspected malignancy.
*   **Procedure:** **Diverticulectomy with Cricopharyngeal Myotomy**,.
    *   Approach: Transcervical incision (usually left side).
    *   The pouch is identified, excised, and the defect is sutured.
    *   **[[Cricopharyngeal Myotomy]]** is essential to relieve the underlying sphincter spasm and prevent recurrence,.

### 3. Endoscopic Management (Internal Approach)
Preferred in elderly/debilitated patients or those with smaller pouches. The principle is to divide the septum (party wall) between the pouch and the esophagus, creating a common cavity (diverticulotomy),.

| Procedure | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Dohlman’s Procedure** | Endoscopic division of the cricopharyngeal bar (septum) using **diathermy**,,. |
| **Endoscopic Stapling** | Uses a stapling gun to simultaneously divide the septum and seal the mucosal edges. Reduces risk of leak and bleeding. Currently the preferred method,. |
| **Laser Diverticulotomy** | Division of the septum using **CO2 Laser** under microscopic guidance,,. |

**Comparison of Approaches:**
*   **Endoscopic:** Shorter hospital stay, faster oral intake, no external scar, lower risk of nerve injury.
*   **Open:** Higher success rate for very large pouches, allows complete removal, higher risk of fistula and [[Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve]] injury.
