# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Behavioural change communication in malaria

### Behavioural Change Communication (BCC) in Malaria

**Behavioural Change Communication (BCC)** is a key supportive intervention and strategy under the [[National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP)]] for the prevention and control of malaria.

#### 1. Definition and Concept
*   **Definition:** BCC is defined as a systematic process of learning that empowers individuals, families, and communities to take rational and informed decisions through appropriate knowledge.
*   **Goal:** It motivates people to change their inappropriate or unhealthy behavior or to continue a healthy behavior regarding malaria prevention and treatment.
*   **Outcome:** It facilitates pertinent action through changed mindsets and modified behavior.

#### 2. Key Objectives of BCC
The primary objective is to enhance awareness regarding transmission risk reduction, treatment availability, and services at different levels.

**Specific Targets for Behavioral Change:**
*   **Early Recognition:** Identifying signs and symptoms of malaria promptly.
*   **Early Treatment Seeking:** seeking care from an appropriate provider immediately upon symptom onset.
*   **Treatment Adherence:** Ensuring compliance with complete treatment regimens to prevent drug resistance.
*   **Protection of Vulnerable Groups:** Ensuring specific protection for children and pregnant women.
*   **Vector Control Acceptance:**
    *   Regular use of [[Insecticide Treated Bed Nets (ITNs)]] or [[Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs)]].
    *   Acceptance of [[Indoor Residual Spray (IRS)]] operations in the community.

#### 3. Steps in Behaviour Change
The process of BCC moves a person through specific stages to achieve a sustainable change in habit.

| Stage | Thought Process/Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Desire** | "I want to" |
| **Knowledge** | "I know" |
| **Skills** | "I can" |
| **Ability/Facilitation** | "It's easy/I'm joining in" |
| **Reinforcement** | "It's worthwhile" |
*Based on the steps of BCC*

#### 4. Implementation Strategies
*   **[[Anti-Malaria Month]]:** Observed every year in **June** (prior to the onset of the monsoon and transmission season) throughout the country.
    *   *Purpose:* To enhance awareness, encourage community participation, and consolidate inter-sectoral collaborative efforts.
*   **Channels:** Clear messages are communicated through different, credible channels, including mass media campaigns and inter-personal communication.
*   **National Strategic Plan (2017-22):** Aims for "Near Universal coverage" by BCC activities to create an enabling environment for malaria elimination.

*   **D** - **D**aily use of Bed Nets (LLINs)
*   **S** - **S**ource reduction participation

**Clinical Relevance:**
Effective BCC is critical because medical technology (drugs/sprays) alone is often ineffective if people do not accept it. For example, IRS is useless if villagers refuse to let spray teams enter their homes, and drugs fail if patients stop taking them once symptoms subside. BCC bridges the gap between available technology and its actual utilization by the community.
