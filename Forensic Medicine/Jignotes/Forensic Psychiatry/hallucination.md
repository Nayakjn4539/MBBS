# [[Forensic Psychiatry]] > hallucination

### **Definition**
[[Hallucination]] is defined as a false sense of perception without any external object or stimulus. It is a perception in the absence of an external stimulus that has the qualities of a real perception.
*   The subject perceives things which do not exist.
*   It originates from within the mind but is projected outwards as if appearing in the external world.

### **Classification of Hallucinations**

The classification is primarily based on the sensory modality involved:

#### **1. Visual Hallucinations**
*   Seeing objects, people, or flashes of light that are not present.
*   **Common in:**
    *   **Organic brain syndromes:** [[Delirium]] (e.g., high fevers, metabolic disorders).
    *   **Substance withdrawal:** [[Delirium Tremens]] (alcohol withdrawal) – often terrifying images of animals, insects, or snakes.
    *   **Poisoning:** [[Datura]], [[Cannabis]], LSD.
    *   **Lilliputian Hallucinations (Micropsia):** Seeing small people or objects; seen in cocaine intoxication or delirium.

#### **2. Auditory Hallucinations**
*   Hearing voices, noises, or music.
*   **Elementary:** Hearing simple sounds like whistles, bangs, or humming.
*   **Complex:** Hearing voices arguing, commenting on one's actions, or commanding.
*   **Common in:** Functional psychoses like [[Schizophrenia]] (diagnostic significance).
    *   **First Rank Symptoms (Schneider):** Voices arguing, voices commenting on actions, audible thoughts (Thought Echo).
    *   **Alcoholic Hallucinosis:** Threatening or derogatory voices occurring in clear consciousness.

#### **3. Olfactory Hallucinations**
*   Smelling non-existent odors, usually unpleasant (e.g., burning rubber, rotting flesh).
*   **Common in:** Temporal lobe [[epilepsy]] (uncinate fits), depressive psychosis, and schizophrenia.

#### **4. Gustatory Hallucinations**
*   Perception of strange or unpleasant tastes (e.g., metallic or bitter taste).
*   **Common in:** Epilepsy, schizophrenia, or paranoid states (patient may believe they are being poisoned).

#### **5. Tactile (Haptic) Hallucinations**
*   Sensation of touch, pain, heat, or insects crawling on the skin.
*   **Common in:** Drug intoxication and withdrawal.
*   **Formication (Magnan's Symptom/Cocaine Bugs):** A specific type of tactile hallucination where the person feels insects/worms crawling under the skin. Seen typically in [[Cocaine]] abuse and chronic alcoholism.

#### **6. Other Types**
*   **Psychomotor/Kinesthetic:** Sensation of movement of parts of the body or floating/flying when actually stationary.
*   **Hypnagogic:** Occurs while **falling asleep** (physiologically normal or seen in [[Narcolepsy]]).
*   **Hypnopompic:** Occurs while **waking up** (physiologically normal).
*   **Reflex Hallucinations:** A stimulus in one sensory field produces a hallucination in another (e.g., hearing a sound produces a visual image).
*   **Extracampine:** Hallucinations occurring outside the sensory field (e.g., seeing a person standing behind one's back).
*   **Somatic/Visceral:** False perception of inner organs (e.g., twisting of intestines, sexual sensations).

### **Etiology**

| Category | Causes |
| :--- | :--- |

| **Substance Use** | **Intoxication:** [[Cannabis]], LSD, [[Datura]], Cocaine, Amphetamines.<br>**Withdrawal:** Alcohol ([[Delirium Tremens]]), Sedatives. |
| **Physiological** | Sensory deprivation (solitary confinement), extreme fatigue, sleep deprivation. |

### **Key Differences: Hallucination vs Illusion vs Delusion**

| Feature | **Hallucination** | **Illusion** | **Delusion** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | False perception *without* external stimulus. | False interpretation of a *real* external stimulus. | False, unshakeable *belief*. |
| **Stimulus** | Absent. | Present but misinterpreted. | N/A (Thought disorder). |
| **Correction** | Cannot be corrected by reasoning/logic. | Can often be corrected on closer inspection (unless psychotic). | Cannot be corrected by reasoning/logic. |
| **Example** | Seeing a snake where there is nothing. | Seeing a rope and thinking it is a snake. | Believing the snake was sent by aliens to spy. |

### **Specific Forensic Toxicology Correlations**

1.  **Datura Poisoning:**
    *   Produces vivid **visual and auditory** hallucinations.
    *   **Carphologia:** The patient picks at bedclothes or tries to thread an imaginary needle.
    *   Mnemonic: **"Blind as a bat, mad as a hatter, red as a beet, hot as a hare, dry as a bone."** (Mad as a hatter refers to the hallucinations/delirium).

2.  **Cocaine:**
    *   **Magnan’s Symptom (Cocaine Bugs):** Tactile hallucination of bugs crawling under the skin.
    *   **Lilliputian Hallucinations:** Seeing miniature people.

3.  **Alcohol:**
    *   **Delirium Tremens:** Visual hallucinations (zoopsia - seeing rats, snakes) in a clouded consciousness.
    *   **Alcoholic Hallucinosis:** Auditory hallucinations in a clear consciousness.

4.  **Cannabis:**
    *   Produces visual and auditory hallucinations, often associated with run-amok behavior.

### **Medicolegal Importance**

*   **Criminal Responsibility (Section 84 IPC - McNaughten's Rule):**
    *   Hallucinations alone do not constitute legal insanity.
    *   The defense must prove that the hallucination prevented the accused from knowing the **nature of the act** or that it was **wrong/contrary to law**.
    *   **Command Hallucinations:** Voices ordering a person to kill or harm others are highly dangerous. If a person acts under such "commands" due to a disease of the mind (like Schizophrenia), they may be held not criminally responsible.
    *   A person acting in self-defense against a hallucinatory attack (e.g., seeing a demon attacking them) may be exempted.

*   **Civil Responsibility:**
    *   **Testamentary Capacity:** A will made under the influence of hallucinations (e.g., voices telling the testator that his children are trying to kill him) may be declared invalid.
    *   **Marriage:** Persistent hallucinations may be a ground for divorce or nullity if it constitutes unsoundness of mind.

*   **Diagnosis of Feigned Insanity:**
    *   In true insanity, hallucinations are often consistent and accompanied by other signs (affect, thought disorder).
    *   Malingerers often describe vague, dramatic, or atypical hallucinations and may claim they stopped immediately upon arrest.

### **Mnemonics**

**Types of Hallucinations:**
**"VOG TAH"**
*   **V**isual (Organic/Delirium)
*   **O**lfactory (Temporal lobe epilepsy)
*   **G**ustatory (Epilepsy/Depression)
*   **T**actile (Cocaine/Alcohol)
*   **A**uditory (Schizophrenia)
*   **H**ypnagogic/Hypnopompic (Sleep-related)

**Sleep-related Hallucinations:**
*   **HypnaGOgic:** Occurs when you **GO** to sleep.
*   **HypnoPOMPic:** Occurs when you **POP** out of bed (wake up).
