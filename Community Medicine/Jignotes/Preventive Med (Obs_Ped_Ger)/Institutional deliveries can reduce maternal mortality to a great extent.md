# [[PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IN OBSTETRICS, PAEDIATRICS AND GERIATRICS]] > Institutional deliveries can reduce maternal mortality to a great extent

### **Institutional Deliveries and Reduction of Maternal Mortality**

**Institutional delivery** refers to childbirth taking place in a medical facility (public or private) under the supervision of trained health professionals. It is a critical strategy in [[Preventive Obstetrics]] to lower the [[Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)]] and [[Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR)]].

---

### **1. Rationale: Why Institutional Delivery Reduces Mortality?**

The majority of maternal deaths occur during labor, delivery, or the immediate postpartum period (first 48 hours). Institutional deliveries address the primary causes of maternal death through:

*   **Skilled Attendance:** Presence of [[Skilled Birth Attendants (SBA)]] (Doctors, Nurses, ANMs) capable of managing normal deliveries and identifying complications early.
*   **Asepsis (The 5 Cleans):** Hospitals provide a sterile environment, significantly reducing the risk of [[Puerperal Sepsis]].
    *   *Clean hands*
    *   *Clean delivery surface*
    *   *Clean cord cut (new blade)*
    *   *Clean cord tie*
    *   *Clean cord stump (no applicant)*
*   **Management of Complications:** Immediate access to **Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC)** for conditions like:
    *   **Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH):** Accounts for ~38% of maternal deaths in India. Institutions have uterotonics (Oxytocin) and surgical backup.
    *   **Eclampsia:** Availability of Magnesium Sulfate and critical care monitoring.
    *   **Obstructed Labor:** Facility for Caesarean Section (C-section).
*   **Newborn Resuscitation:** Immediate availability of equipment to manage birth asphyxia.

### **2. Levels of Care for Institutional Delivery**

To ensure quality and accessibility, facilities are designated as **Delivery Points**:

| Level | Facility Type | Services Provided |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Level I** | Sub-centres, PHC | Basic obstetric care, [[Newborn Care Corner (NBCC)]], Normal delivery. |
| **Level II** | CHC, 24x7 PHC | **BEmOC** (Basic Emergency Obstetric Care), Assisted deliveries, Management of complications. |
| **Level III** | District Hospitals, Medical Colleges | **CEmOC** (Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric Care), C-Section, Blood Transfusion, [[Special Newborn Care Unit (SNCU)]]. |

### **3. Government Initiatives to Promote Institutional Deliveries**

The Government of India has launched several schemes under the [[National Health Mission (NHM)]] to remove financial and access barriers.

#### **A. Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY)**
*   **Type:** 100% Centrally sponsored scheme integrating cash assistance with delivery and post-delivery care.
*   **Objective:** To reduce MMR and IMR by promoting institutional delivery among poor pregnant women.
*   **Beneficiaries:**
    *   **Low Performing States (LPS):** All women delivering in government health centers.
    *   **High Performing States (HPS):** BPL women, SC/ST women aged 19+ years (up to 2 live births).
*   **Role of ASHA:** Acts as a link worker, escorts the woman to the facility, and receives incentives for ensuring institutional delivery.

#### **B. Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK)**
Ensures **zero out-of-pocket expenses** for pregnant women and sick newborns.
*   **Entitlements:**
    *   Free and cashless delivery (including C-Section).
    *   Free drugs and consumables.
    *   Free diet (3 days for normal, 7 days for C-section).
    *   Free diagnostics and blood provision.
    *   **Free Transport:** Home to facility, inter-facility referral, and drop-back home (102/108 Ambulance services).

#### **C. Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA)**
*   Guarantees antenatal check-ups by obstetricians/medical officers on the **9th of every month** to detect high-risk pregnancies early, ensuring they are referred for institutional delivery.

#### **D. LaQshya (Labour Room Quality Improvement Initiative)**
*   Aims to improve the quality of care in labor rooms and maternity operation theatres to ensure respectful maternity care and reduce preventable maternal/newborn mortality.

#### **E. SUMAN (Surakshit Matritva Aashwasan)**
*   Provides assured, dignified, and respectful delivery of quality healthcare at zero cost.
*   **Zero tolerance** for denial of services to any woman or newborn.

### **4. Impact on Indicators**

*   **Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR):** There is an inverse relationship between the proportion of deliveries assisted by skilled personnel and the MMR. As institutional deliveries rise, MMR declines.
*   **Infant Mortality Rate (IMR):** Institutional care reduces early neonatal mortality caused by asphyxia and sepsis.

### **Clinical Relevance**
[[Clinical Relevance: Obstetric Emergency]]
In a home setting, a sudden bout of **atonic PPH** (Postpartum Hemorrhage) can be fatal within minutes. In an institution, the "Active Management of Third Stage of Labor" (AMTSL) is routinely practiced to prevent PPH, and if it occurs, fluids, blood products, and surgical interventions are immediately available to save the mother's life.

### **Mnemonics**

**To remember the "5 Cleans" essential in delivery (institutional or home):**
**"3 C's and 2 Hands"**
1.  **C**lean Surface
2.  **C**lean Cord Cut (Blade)
3.  **C**lean Cord Tie
4.  **C**lean **Hands** (Attendant)
5.  **C**lean water/towel (for cleaning hands)

*(Note: Sometimes taught as 7 cleans adding water and towel separately).*

**To remember Schemes promoting Institutional Delivery:**
**"J J S L P"**
*   **J** - Janani Suraksha Yojana (**JSY**) - Cash
*   **J** - Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (**JSSK**) - Cashless/Free
*   **S** - **SUMAN** (Surakshit Matritva Aashwasan) - Dignity/Zero Denial
*   **L** - **LaQshya** - Quality of Labor Room
*   **P** - **PMSMA** - Antenatal Screening (High Risk detection)
