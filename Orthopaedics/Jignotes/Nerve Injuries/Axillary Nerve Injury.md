# [[Nerve Injuries]] > Axillary Nerve Injury

### Axillary Nerve Injury

#### Anatomy and Course
The [[axillary nerve]] (circumflex humeral nerve) is a major peripheral nerve of the upper limb.
*   **Origin:** It arises from the **Posterior Cord** of the [[brachial plexus]].
*   **Root Value:** **C5, C6**.
*   **Course:** 
    *   It winds posteriorly around the lower border of the [[subscapularis]].
    *   It passes through the **Quadrangular space** to reach the posterior aspect of the [[surgical neck of humerus]].
    *   Here, it is in close relation to the medial side of the surgical neck and the inferior aspect of the shoulder joint capsule.

**Branches and Supply:**
The nerve divides into anterior and posterior branches.

| Branch | Structures Supplied | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Anterior Branch** | Winds around the surgical neck; supplies the [[Deltoid muscle]] (except the lower half). | Main motor supply for shoulder abduction. |
| **Posterior Branch** | Supplies [[Teres minor]] and the lower half of the Deltoid. Ends as the [[Upper lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm]]. | External rotation of shoulder; Sensation to the "Regimental Badge" area. |

#### Etiology and Mechanism of Injury
The axillary nerve is vulnerable due to its close proximity to the glenohumeral joint and the proximal humerus.

1.  **Shoulder Dislocation:** This is the **most common cause**. The nerve is stretched or compressed during [[anterior dislocation of shoulder]] (especially subcoracoid/subglenoid types).
2.  **Fractures:** [[Fracture surgical neck of humerus]] or fractures of the glenoid.
3.  **Iatrogenic:** 
    *   During shoulder surgeries (e.g., thermal shrinkage of the capsule).
    *   Intramuscular injections incorrectly placed in the deltoid.
4.  **Traction Injuries:** "Crutch palsy" (though radial nerve is more common, axillary can be affected in high compression) or blunt trauma to the shoulder.

**Clinical Implication:**
Always check the neurovascular status (specifically the axillary nerve) **before** and **after** reducing a shoulder dislocation to rule out iatrogenic injury during manipulation,.

#### Clinical Features
The clinical presentation depends on the severity (neurapraxia vs. neurotmesis) but typically presents with specific motor and sensory deficits.

**1. Motor Deficit (Muscle Paralysis)**
*   **Deltoid Paralysis:** The patient is unable to abduct the shoulder effectively. 
    *   *Note:* The first 15° of abduction (initiated by [[Supraspinatus]]) may be preserved, but abduction from 15° to 90° is lost.
*   **Teres Minor Paralysis:** Weakness in external rotation of the shoulder.
*   **Deformity:** The shoulder loses its round contour and appears **flat** (loss of the deltoid bulge). The arm hangs by the side, adducted and internally rotated.

**2. Sensory Deficit**
*   **Regimental Badge Sign:** There is a patch of anesthesia or hypoesthesia over the lower half of the deltoid muscle (lateral aspect of the proximal arm),.
*   This area corresponds to the distribution of the [[upper lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm]].

#### Diagnosis and Evaluation
1.  **Look:** Inspect for wasting of the deltoid (flattening of the shoulder) compared to the normal side.
2.  **Feel:** Test sensation over the lateral aspect of the upper arm (Regimental badge area).
3.  **Move:** Ask the patient to abduct the arm against resistance (to test Deltoid) and externally rotate (to test Teres Minor).
4.  **Investigations:**
    *   **X-ray:** To rule out associated fractures (proximal humerus) or unreduced dislocations.
    *   **Electrodiagnostic Studies ([[EMG]]/[[NCV]]):** Useful to confirm the diagnosis, localize the lesion, and determine the severity (neurapraxia vs. axonotmesis). Usually performed 3 weeks after injury if no recovery is seen.

#### Management

**Conservative Management**
Most injuries associated with closed fractures or dislocations are **neurapraxias** and recover spontaneously.
*   **Immobilization/Splinting:** The limb is supported to prevent overstretching of the paralyzed deltoid.
    *   **[[Aeroplane Splint]]** or **Shoulder Abduction Splint:** This keeps the shoulder in abduction, relaxing the deltoid muscle and preventing contracture of the adductors,.
*   **Physiotherapy:** 
    *   Passive range of motion exercises to prevent stiffness (frozen shoulder).
    *   Galvanic stimulation to the deltoid (to maintain muscle bulk while awaiting nerve recovery).

**Operative Management**
Surgery is indicated if there is no sign of recovery after 3–6 months (monitored by EMG) or in open injuries.
*   **Nerve Repair:** Epineural suture if the cut ends are clean and visible.
*   **Nerve Grafting:** If there is a gap (e.g., using [[sural nerve]] graft).
*   **Nerve Transfer (Neurotization):** In cases of avulsion or proximal injury where repair is impossible.
    *   Example: Transfer of a branch of the [[radial nerve]] (to the long head of triceps) to the axillary nerve.

**Mnemonics:**
*   To remember the nerve roots: **Axillary** has the shape of an **Axe**. An Axe looks like the number **5** and **6**. (Roots: C5, C6).
*   To remember the sensory sign: **The General's Patch** or **Regimental Badge** (The nerve supplies the area where a soldier wears their regiment badge).
