### **Prism (Ophthalmic Surgical Equipment)**

#### **Basic Optics and Principles**
A [[Prism]] is a transparent refracting medium bounded by two plane surfaces inclined at an angle. It is a fundamental tool in both diagnostic and therapeutic ophthalmology.

*   **Structure:**
    *   **Apical Angle (Refracting Angle):** The angle between the two surfaces. The greater the angle, the stronger the prismatic effect.
    *   **Axis:** The line bisecting the apical angle.
    *   **Base:** The surface opposite the apical angle. Orientation is indicated by the base position (e.g., Base-in, Base-out).

*   **Mechanism of Action:**
    *   **Refraction:** Light rays passing through a prism are deviated towards the **Base**,.
    *   **Image Displacement:** The virtual image formed appears displaced towards the **Apex**,.

*   **Unit of Measurement:**
    *   **Prism Diopter ($\Delta$):** The power is measured in prism diopters.
    *   **Definition:** One prism diopter ($1\Delta$) produces a linear displacement of **1 cm** of an object situated at a distance of **1 meter**,.
    *   **Clinical Conversion:** $2\Delta$ is approximately equal to 1 degree of arc.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a triangular prism showing light entering, bending towards the base, and the projected virtual image appearing shifted towards the apex. Label Base, Apex, and Angle of Deviation.

#### **Types of Prisms used in Clinical Practice**
1.  **Loose Prisms:** Individual prisms of varying powers used for neutralization.
2.  **Prism Bars:** A series of prisms of increasing power mounted on a bar (vertical and horizontal bars). Used for the [[Prism Bar Cover Test]].
3.  **Risley (Rotary) Prisms:** Two prisms mounted back-to-back that can be rotated to gradually increase power; often found in phoropters.
4.  **Fresnel Prisms:** Thin, membrane-like press-on prisms used for temporary therapeutic correction on spectacles.

#### **Diagnostic Uses of Prisms**

Prisms are indispensable for the evaluation of [[Strabismus]] and [[Binocular Vision]].

**1. Objective Measurement of Squint**
*   **Prism Bar Cover Test (PBCT):** The most accurate method to measure the angle of deviation (latent and manifest).
    *   **Principle:** Prisms of increasing strength are placed before the eye until the neutralizing endpoint is reached (no movement on cover test).
    *   **Placement Rule:** The **apex** of the prism points towards the direction of deviation (or **Base** opposite to the deviation),.
        *   **Esotropia:** Base Out (BO),.
        *   **Exotropia:** Base In (BI),.
        *   **Hypertropia:** Base Down.
*   **Krimsky Test:** Modified Hirschberg test used when visual acuity is poor or fixation is eccentric. Prisms are placed in front of the fixing eye to center the corneal reflex in the squinting eye,.

**2. Assessment of Binocular Single Vision (BSV)**
*   **4 Prism Base Out Test:** Used to detect [[Microtropia]] (small angle squint < 10$\Delta$) and central suppression scotoma,.
    *   **Method:** A $4\Delta$ base-out prism is placed before one eye.
    *   **Normal Response:** Biphasic movement (Eye under prism moves in to refixate; fellow eye moves out then in to refuse).
    *   **Microtropia/Suppression:** No movement is observed if the prism is placed over the scotoma.
*   **Measurement of Fusional Reserve:** Testing the eye's ability to maintain single vision against increasing prism loads (Vergence power),.

**3. Subjective Tests**
*   **Maddox Rod Test:** Prisms are used to superimpose the red line (seen by one eye) and the white light (seen by the other) to measure heterophoria,.

#### **Therapeutic Uses of Prisms**

**1. Relieving Diplopia**
*   Indicated for patients with decompensated [[Heterophoria]] or small tropias causing double vision.
*   Used in paralytic squint to fuse images in the primary position.
*   **Correction Rule:** The prism is prescribed with the **Apex** pointing in the direction of the deviation (Light is bent away from the fovea, so the prism bends it back towards the fovea).
    *   *Example:* For Esophoria (eye turns in), prescribe Base Out (Apex In).

**2. Orthoptic Exercises**
*   Used to exercise weak muscles and improve fusional reserve.
*   The prism is placed with the **Base** in the direction of the deviation to force the eye to work against it (Adverse Prism exercises).

#### **Integration into Ophthalmic Instruments**

Prisms form the core optical component of several critical instruments:

| Instrument | Prism Type/Function | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Goldmann Applanation Tonometer]]** | **Doubling Biprism** | Splits the image of the fluorescein rings into two mires to define the endpoint of applanation (area 3.06 mm),. |
| **[[Keratometer]]** | **Doubling Prism** | Used to double the image (mires) to negate the effect of eye movements during curvature measurement,. |
| **[[Gonioscope]]** | **Mirrors/Prisms** | Refracts light from the anterior chamber angle to the observer, overcoming total internal reflection. |
| **Slit Lamp** | **Porro-Abbe Prisms** | Used in the binocular microscope to re-invert the image, making it erect. |

### **Clinical Implications & Rules of Thumb**

*   **Measuring Deviation:** Put the prism **Base** *Opposite* to the deviation (e.g., Exotropia $\rightarrow$ Eye Out $\rightarrow$ Base In).
*   **Prescribing for Diplopia:** Put the prism **Apex** *Towards* the deviation (or Base *Opposite*).
*   **Confusion Avoidance:** "Light to Base, Image to Apex."
*   **High Power Effect:** Thick glasses (high plus aphakic specs) act like prisms peripherally, causing a "Roving Ring Scotoma" and the Jack-in-the-box phenomenon,.
