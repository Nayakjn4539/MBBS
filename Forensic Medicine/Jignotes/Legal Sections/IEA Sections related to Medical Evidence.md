### [[Indian Evidence Act]] (IEA), 1872: Sections Related to Medical Evidence

The Indian Evidence Act (IEA) governs the admissibility of evidence in Indian courts. A medical officer usually appears in court as an [[Expert Witness]]. The following sections are critical for a medical graduate to understand regarding legal procedures and testimony.

### 1. Definition of Evidence (Section 3 IEA)
**Evidence** means and includes:
1.  **Oral Evidence:** All statements which the Court permits or requires to be made before it by witnesses.
2.  **Documentary Evidence:** All documents produced for the inspection of the Court (e.g., [[Medical Certificates]], Medicolegal Reports).

### 2. Dying Declaration (Section 32 Clause 1 IEA)
This is one of the most important sections for a doctor attending to a terminal patient.
*   **Definition:** It is a written or oral statement of a person who is dying as a result of some unlawful act, relating to the material facts of the cause of his death or circumstances resulting in his death.
*   **Relevance:** It is admissible in court even though the person is not present to testify (Exception to Hearsay Evidence).
*   **Role of Doctor:** Ideally recorded by a Magistrate. If time does not permit, a doctor can record it. The doctor must certify the patient is **Compos Mentis** (sound mind) before recording.

### 3. Opinions of Experts (Section 45 IEA)
*   **Definition:** When the Court has to form an opinion upon a point of foreign law, or of science, or art, or as to identity of handwriting or finger impressions, the opinions upon that point of persons specially skilled in such foreign law, science or art, are relevant facts.
*   **Application:** A doctor is an [[Expert Witness]] under this section. The court relies on the doctor for opinions on cause of death, nature of injuries, weapon used, etc.

### 4. Oral Evidence Must be Direct (Section 60 IEA)
*   **Rule:** Oral evidence must, in all cases, whatever, be direct.
    *   If it refers to a fact which could be seen, it must be the evidence of a witness who says he saw it.
*   **Significance:** A doctor describes facts observed (e.g., dimensions of a wound) as a witness of fact. Opinions expressed in treatises (textbooks) are accepted under this section if the author cannot be called without delay/expense.

### 5. Examination of Witnesses (Sections 137 & 138 IEA)
These sections define the stages of recording evidence in court.

| Stage | Section | Description | Conducted By |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Examination-in-Chief** | **Sec 137** | Examination of the witness by the party who calls him. | Public Prosecutor (in criminal cases) |
| **Cross-Examination** | **Sec 137** | Examination of the witness by the adverse party. Tests credibility. | Defense Lawyer |
| **Re-Examination** | **Sec 137** | Examination of the witness, *subsequent* to cross-examination, by the party who called him. Used to clarify points raised in cross-examination. | Public Prosecutor |
| **Order of Examination** | **Sec 138** | Witnesses shall be first examined-in-chief, then (if adverse party desires) cross-examined, then (if calling party desires) re-examined. | - |

**Mnemonic for Order:** **E-C-R** (Examination-in-chief $\rightarrow$ Cross $\rightarrow$ Re-examination).

### 6. Leading Questions (Sections 141, 142, 143 IEA)
*   **Definition (Sec 141):** Any question suggesting the answer which the person putting it wishes or expects to receive (e.g., "Did you use a white knife?").
*   **When NOT allowed (Sec 142):** In Examination-in-Chief and Re-examination (unless permission is given by Court).
*   **When allowed (Sec 143):** Leading questions may be asked in **Cross-Examination**.

### 7. Hostile Witness (Section 154 IEA)
*   **Definition:** A witness who makes statements against the interest of the party who called him (e.g., a doctor changing his opinion in court to favor the accused).
*   **Procedure:** The Court may permit the person who calls a witness to put any questions to him which might be put in cross-examination (i.e., the prosecution can cross-examine their own witness).

### 8. Refreshing Memory (Section 159 IEA)
*   **Provision:** A witness may, while under examination, refresh his memory by referring to any writing made by himself at the time of the transaction concerning which he is questioned, or so soon afterwards that the Court considers it likely that the transaction was at that time fresh in his memory.
*   **Significance:** A doctor can refer to his/her original notes, [[Postmortem Report]], or MLR in the witness box.

### 9. Protection of Witness (Section 132 IEA)
*   **Provision:** A witness shall not be excused from answering any question as to any matter relevant to the matter in issue... upon the ground that the answer... will criminate, or may tend directly or indirectly to criminate, such witness.
*   **Proviso:** However, no such answer, which a witness shall be compelled to give, shall subject him to any arrest or prosecution, or be proved against him in any criminal proceeding, except a prosecution for giving false evidence (Perjury).

### 10. Questions Lawful in Cross-Examination (Section 146 IEA)
During cross-examination, the witness may be asked questions to:
1.  Test his veracity.
2.  Discover who he is and what is his position in life.
3.  Shake his credit, by injuring his character.
*   **Medical Aspect:** A doctor must remain cool and composed even if personal character is attacked to shake credibility.

### 11. Refreshing Memory of Judge (Section 161 IEA) (Also relates to Sec 159)
This section generally deals with the adverse party's right to see the writing used to refresh memory and cross-examine the witness upon it. While Sec 159 allows the *witness* to refresh memory, the expert may also refer to professional treatises to refresh memory or confirm opinions.
