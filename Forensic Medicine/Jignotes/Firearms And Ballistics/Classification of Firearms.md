# [[Firearms And Ballistics]] > Classification of Firearms

### Classification of Firearms

A [[firearm]] is defined as any weapon which discharges a projectile by the expansive force of gases produced by the combustion of an explosive substance (gunpowder/propellant).

Firearms are broadly classified based on the internal characteristics of the barrel, the method of handling, and the mechanism of action.

#### 1. Classification based on the Interior of the Barrel

This is the most medicolegally significant classification.

**A. Rifled Firearms**
The inside of the barrel has spiral grooves cut into it.
*   **Mechanism:** The spiral grooves (rifling) impart a spinning motion to the [[projectile]] (bullet) around its long axis.
*   **Purpose:** To provide **Gyroscopic Stability**, preventing the bullet from tumbling or yawing, thereby increasing range, accuracy, and penetrating power.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Handguns:** [[Revolver]], [[Pistol]] (Automatic/Semi-automatic).
    *   **Shoulder Arms:** [[Rifle]]s (e.g., .303, AK-47, INSAS).

**B. Smooth-bore Firearms**
The inside of the barrel is smooth without any grooves.
*   **Mechanism:** Projects a mass of small lead pellets (shots) or a single lead slug.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Shoulder Arms:** [[Shotgun]]s (Breech-loading), Muskets (Muzzle-loading).
    *   **Improvised:** Country-made guns (*Katta*), Signal pistols.

#### 2. Classification based on Action/Loading

*   **Breech Loading:** Ammunition is loaded from the rear end (breech) of the barrel. (Most modern firearms: Revolvers, Pistols, Shotguns).
*   **Muzzle Loading:** Ammunition (powder, wad, projectile) is loaded from the front end (muzzle) using a ramrod. (Historical muskets, some country-made guns).
*   **Magazine/Repeating:** Contains a magazine to hold multiple cartridges (e.g., Pistols, Rifles).
*   **Automatic:** Fires continuously as long as the trigger is pressed (e.g., Machine guns).
*   **Semi-automatic:** Fires one bullet per trigger pull but automatically ejects the empty shell and loads the next cartridge (e.g., Modern Pistols).

---

#### 3. Classification based on Handling

*   **Handguns:** Short barrel, designed to be held and fired with one hand. (e.g., Revolvers, Pistols).
*   **Shoulder Arms:** Long barrel, designed to be braced against the shoulder. (e.g., Rifles, Shotguns).

---

#### 4. Non-Traditional/Improvised Firearms

1.  **Country-made Firearms:** Locally manufactured by blacksmiths using water pipes or steering tubes. Usually smooth-bored but fire rifle ammunition. Highly unpredictable and dangerous to the shooter.
2.  **Air Guns/Gas-operated:** Projectiles (slugs) are discharged by compressed air or gas (CO2). Usually low velocity but can be fatal if hits vital organs like the eye or temple.
3.  **Zip Guns:** Improvised devices (like a modified pen or tire gauge) capable of firing a cartridge.
4.  **Stud Guns:** Used in construction to fire nails/studs into masonry.

### Important Phenomena Related to Firearms

#### A. Rifling
The process of cutting spiral grooves along the inner surface of the barrel of a firearm.
*   **Grooves:** The cut-out (depressed) portions.
*   **Lands:** The raised metal portions between the grooves.
*   **Calibre:** In rifled weapons, it is the distance between two diagonally opposite **lands**.
*   **Forensic Significance:** As the bullet passes through the barrel, the lands bite into the metal of the bullet, leaving unique **Striations** (secondary markings). These are like "fingerprints" of the gun and allow the ballistic expert to match a specific fired bullet to a specific gun using a **Comparison Microscope**.

**Mnemonic for Rifling Purpose:** **GAS**
*   **G**yroscopic stability
*   **A**ccuracy
*   **S**pin

#### B. Choking
A phenomenon specific to **Shotguns**. It is the constriction of the barrel bore at the muzzle end.
*   **Purpose:** To prevent the rapid spread (dispersion) of pellets/shots after they leave the muzzle, thereby increasing the effective range and concentrating the impact.
*   **Types:**
    1.  **Cylinder Bore:** No constriction (maximum spread).
    2.  **Improved Cylinder:** Slight constriction.
    3.  **Modified Choke:** Moderate constriction.
    4.  **Full Choke:** Maximum constriction (tightest shot pattern).

#### C. Paradox Gun
A hybrid firearm. It is essentially a shotgun (smooth-bore) but has **rifling** in the distal few inches of the barrel near the muzzle.
*   **Utility:** It can fire both shots (pellets) and a single solid lead slug with reasonable accuracy.

### Comparison: Rifled Firearms vs. Smooth-bore Firearms

| Feature | Rifled Firearm (Rifle/Pistol/Revolver) | Smooth-bore Firearm (Shotgun) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Interior of Barrel** | Contains spiral Grooves and Lands ([[Rifling]]). | Smooth polished surface. |
| **Projectile** | Single Bullet (elongated). | Multiple Pellets (lead shots) or single Slug. |
| **Ammunition** | [[Cartridge]] case usually brass/metal. No wad usually. | Cartridge case usually plastic/cardboard with brass base. Contains Wads. |
| **Calibre/Bore** | Measured as distance between opposite lands (e.g., .303, 9mm). | Measured by **Gauge** (number of lead balls of that diameter weighing 1 lb). |
| **Range** | Long range (High velocity). | Short range (Low velocity). |
| **Wound Profile** | Entry usually smaller than exit; abrasion collar present. | Entry depends on dispersion; scalloped margins at distance; wad injury possible. |

### Medicolegal Aspects

1.  **Identification of Weapon:** The nature of the entry wound (rifled vs. shotgun) helps identify the class of weapon used.
2.  **Range of Fire:** The presence of burning, blackening (smoke), and tattooing (unburnt powder) helps determine the distance of fire.
    *   **Contact Shot:** Muzzle impression, cherry-red tissue discoloration (CO gas).
    *   **Close Range:** Burning and blackening present.
3.  **Matching:**
    *   **Rifled weapons:** Striations on the bullet match the barrel's rifling.
    *   **Shotguns:** Difficult to match pellets to a specific gun; wads and cartridge cases are more useful for identification.
4.  **Nature of Injury:** High velocity rifled bullets cause cavitation and extensive internal damage (hydrostatic shock) compared to low velocity shotgun pellets.
