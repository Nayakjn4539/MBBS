# Record Linkage

### Definition
**Record Linkage** is defined as the process of bringing together records relating to one individual (or to one family), where these records originate in different times or places.

### Concept of Medical Record Linkage
The term [[Medical Record Linkage]] implies the assembly and maintenance of a specific file for each individual in a population. This file compiles the most important records relating to their health, essentially creating a "womb to tomb" health profile.

### Types of Records Linked
To create a comprehensive health profile, various independent data sources are linked using a unique identifier. The events commonly recorded include:
*   **Vital Events:** [[Birth]], [[Marriage]], and [[Death]].
*   **Clinical Events:** Hospital admissions and discharges.
*   **Other Health Data:** Sickness absence from work, prophylactic procedures (e.g., immunization), and the use of social services.

### Applications and Uses
Record linkage is a powerful tool in [[Epidemiology]] and medical statistics. Its primary uses include:
1.  **Studying Disease Associations:** It is particularly suitable for studying associations between different diseases or events that may have *aetiological significance* (e.g., linking exposure in childhood to cancer in adulthood).
2.  **Measurement of Morbidity:** It provides a more accurate assessment of sickness in the community compared to isolated hospital records.
3.  **Chronic Disease Epidemiology:** It is vital for understanding the natural history and progression of chronic conditions.
4.  **Family and Genetic Studies:** It is useful for pedigree analysis, [[Twin Studies]], and tracking hereditary disorders.
5.  **Longitudinal Studies:** It facilitates the follow-up of individuals or cohorts over long periods.

### Mnemonic for Uses: "LINK"
*   **L** - **L**ongitudinal tracking of patients
*   **I** - **I**dentifying associations between diseases
*   **N** - **N**atural history of chronic diseases
*   **K** - **K**inship and genetic studies

### Limitations
Despite its utility, Record Linkage faces significant hurdles:
*   **Data Volume:** The main problem is the immense volume of data that accumulates, requiring sophisticated storage and retrieval systems.
*   **Feasibility:** Due to the need for advanced infrastructure and unique identification systems, record linkage is currently **beyond the reach of many developing countries**. Consequently, it has been applied only on a limited scale in practice.

### Clinical Relevance
For a physician, the concept of record linkage translates to **Continuity of Care**. In a fragmented health system, a patient may visit multiple specialists; without linkage, critical history (allergies, past surgeries) may be lost. Record linkage prevents [[Medical Errors]], avoids duplication of tests, and ensures a holistic treatment approach.
