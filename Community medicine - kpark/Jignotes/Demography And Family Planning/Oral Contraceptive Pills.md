# Oral Contraceptive Pills (OCPs)

**Oral Contraceptives** are hormonal methods used for the spacing of pregnancies. They are among the most effective reversible contraceptive methods when used correctly.

---

### 1. Combined Oral Contraceptive Pills (COCs)

These pills contain a combination of synthetic estrogen and synthetic progestogen.

**Composition**
Most low-dose pills in India (like [[MALA-N]] and [[MALA-D]]) contain:
*   **Estrogen:** Ethinyl estradiol (0.03 mg or 30 mcg)
*   **Progestogen:** Levonorgestrel (0.15 mg or 150 mcg) or Desogestrel

**Regimen**
*   **Packet:** Contains 28 pills (21 Hormonal Pills + 7 Brown Ferrous Fumarate/Iron tablets).
*   **Schedule:** One pill daily for 21 days starting on Day 1 (or Day 5) of the menstrual cycle, followed by 7 iron tablets (during which withdrawal bleeding occurs).
*   **MALA-N:** Supplied **Free of Cost** at PHCs/Sub-centres.
*   **MALA-D:** Sold under **Social Marketing** (subsidized price, approx. Rs. 3).

**Mechanism of Action**
1.  **Inhibits Ovulation:** Blocks pituitary secretion of gonadotropins (LH/FSH). This is the primary mechanism.
2.  **Cervical Mucus:** Thickens mucus, making it impenetrable to sperm.
3.  **Endometrium:** Makes it unfavorable for implantation (atrophic effect).

**Efficacy**
*   **Pearl Index:** 0.1 – 0.5 per 100 Woman Years (HWY).
*   Almost 100% effective if taken regularly.

#### Beneficial Effects (Non-Contraceptive Benefits)
*   **Protection against Cancers:** Reduces risk of [[Ovarian Cancer]] and [[Endometrial Cancer]].
*   **Menstrual Benefits:** Regulates cycle, reduces dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia (decreases Iron Deficiency Anemia).
*   **Others:** Reduces risk of Ectopic pregnancy, Benign breast disease (fibroadenoma), Ovarian cysts, and Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID).

#### Adverse Effects
*   **Cardiovascular:** Myocardial infarction, Cerebral thrombosis, Venous thromboembolism (VTE), Hypertension.

**Clinical Relevance:**
*   **Missed Pill Guidelines:**
    *   If **< 2 pills** missed: Take as soon as remembered (even if 2 pills at once). No backup needed.
    *   If **> 2 pills** missed: Stop packet, use condoms/barrier method until next withdrawal bleed, then start fresh packet.
*   **Drug Interaction:** [[Rifampicin]] (Anti-TB drug) induces liver enzymes and reduces OCP efficacy. Use backup method.

*   **Indication:** Best suited for **Lactating Mothers** (does not suppress lactation like combined pills) and older women with cardiovascular risks.
*   **Disadvantages:** Poor cycle control (irregular bleeding), higher failure rate than COCs, increased risk of ectopic pregnancy compared to COCs.

*   **Dose Schedule:**
    *   First 3 months: **Twice weekly**
