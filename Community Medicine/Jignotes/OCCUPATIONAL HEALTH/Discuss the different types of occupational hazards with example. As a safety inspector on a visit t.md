# [[OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH]] > Discuss the different types of occupational hazards with example. As a safety inspector on a visit to a factory, what measures will you suggest to the authorities for protection of the workers?

### Occupational Hazards

An industrial worker is exposed to five major types of hazards depending upon their occupation. These interact with the worker and may cause specific occupational diseases or general ill-health.

| **Type of Hazard** | **Agents/Factors** | **Examples of Diseases/Conditions** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Physical Hazards** | **Heat and Cold** | Heat hyperpyrexia, [[Heat stroke]], Heat cramps, Frostbite, Trench foot,. |
| | **Light** | [[Occupational cataract]], Miner's nystagmus (due to poor lighting),. |
| | **Noise** | Occupational deafness, Nervousness, Fatigue,. |
| | **Vibration** | "White fingers" (Raynaud's phenomenon), injuries to joints of hands/elbows,. |
| | **Radiation** | UV rays (Welder's flash/keratitis), Ionizing rays (Leukemia, Aplastic anemia, Skin cancer),. |
| | **Pressure** | [[Caisson disease]] (decompression sickness), Air embolism,. |
| | **Electricity** | Burns, Shock. |
| **2. Chemical Hazards** | **Dusts** | [[Pneumoconiosis]] (Silicosis, Anthracosis, Asbestosis, Byssinosis),. |
| | **Gases** | Asphyxiants (CO, Cyanide), Irritants (SO2, Chlorine),. |
| | **Metals** | [[Lead Poisoning]] (Plumbism), Mercury poisoning, Cadmium, Arsenic,. |
| | **Solvents** | Benzene, Carbon bisulphide, Trichloroethylene (causing dermatitis, organ damage). |
| **3. Biological Hazards** | **Infective Agents** | [[Brucellosis]], Anthrax, Tetanus, Leptospirosis, HIV/Hepatitis B (in healthcare workers),. |
| **4. Mechanical Hazards** | **Machinery** | Accidents, injuries due to protruding/moving parts, unsafe machines,. |
| **5. Psychosocial Hazards** | **Work Environment** | Frustration, lack of job satisfaction, insecurity. Leads to Hypertension, [[Peptic ulcer]], Drug abuse, Depression,. |

### Measures for Protection of Workers (Recommendations of Safety Inspector)

As a safety inspector, the recommendations to the factory authorities are grouped into three major categories: **Medical, Engineering, and Legislative measures.**

#### A. Medical Measures
These measures tackle the "Human Factor" and early detection of disease.

1.  **Pre-placement Examination:**
    *   **Concept:** This is the foundation of an efficient occupational health service.
    *   **Goal:** To place the **"Right man in the Right job"** (Ergonomics). The worker's physical and mental capacity must match the job requirements to prevent efficiency loss and health detriment,,.
    *   *Example:* A person with asthma should not be employed in a dusty industry.

2.  **Periodical Examination:**
    *   Essential for workers handling toxic substances (e.g., Lead, dyes, radium).
    *   **Frequency:** Depends on exposure (e.g., Monthly for lead/radium; Daily for dichromates; Annually for general),.
    *   **Goal:** Early diagnosis and prompt treatment (Secondary Prevention).

3.  **Medical and Health Care Services:**
    *   Provision of **First Aid** services within the factory.
    *   [[Immunization]] against specific hazards (e.g., Tetanus, Hepatitis B),.

4.  **Notification:**
    *   Implementation of a system to notify cases of occupational diseases as required by the **Factories Act** and Mines Act to initiate investigation and control.

5.  **Supervision of Working Environment:**
    *   Regular inspection by physicians/engineers to check temperature, lighting, ventilation, and sanitation.

6.  **Health Education:**
    *   Educating workers about risks, proper use of [[Personal Protective Equipment]] (PPE), and personal hygiene (e.g., hand washing before eating to prevent lead ingestion),.

#### B. Engineering Measures
These are technical measures to control hazards at the source.

1.  **Design of Building:** Ensuring proper floor space (minimum **500 cu. ft.** per worker), sufficient height, and fire safety during the blueprint stage,.
2.  **Good Housekeeping:** General cleanliness, white-washing walls (once a year), and keeping machines clean to prevent dust accumulation and accidents,.
3.  **General Ventilation:** Providing fresh air circulation (5 sq. feet ventilating opening per worker) to decrease airborne contaminants.
4.  **Substitution:** Replacing a harmful substance with a harmless/less toxic one.
    *   *Classic Example:* Substituting white phosphorus with **phosphorus sesquisulphide** in the match industry eliminated necrosis of the jaw ("Phossy jaw").
5.  **Dust Control:** Using **wet methods** (wet drilling) instead of dry methods to suppress dust at the point of origin,.
6.  **Enclosure:** Enclosing harmful processes (e.g., grinding machinery) to prevent dust/fumes escape.
7.  **Isolation:** Separating the offensive process from the general workforce, either by **space** (separate building) or **time** (running the process at night).
8.  **Local Exhaust Ventilation (LEV):** Applying suction hoods near the source of dust/fumes to trap them before they enter the worker's breathing zone,.
9.  **Protective Devices (PPE):**
    *   **Respiratory:** Gas masks, respirators.
    *   **Non-respiratory:** Ear plugs (for noise), goggles (for welding), lead aprons (for radiation), gumboots, gloves, and helmets,.
10. **Environmental Monitoring:** Periodical surveys to ensure dusts/gases are within **"Permissible Limits"**.

#### C. Legislative Measures
Strict enforcement of laws to ensure compliance by the management.
*   **The Factories Act, 1948:** Regulations regarding health, safety (fencing machinery), welfare (canteens, creches), working hours (max 48 hours/week), and employment of young persons (prohibited <14 years),.
*   **The Employees State Insurance (ESI) Act, 1948:** Providing social security and benefits (sickness, maternity, disablement),.

**> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a triangle representing the "Intervention Levels". Base: Engineering Controls (Most Effective), Middle: Administrative Controls, Top: PPE (Least Effective but necessary). Also, a diagram of the Epidemiological Triad: Agent, Host, and Environment is useful here.**

**Mnemonic for Prevention (Engineering Measures):**
**"S.L.I.P. E.D."**
*   **S** - Substitution
*   **L** - Local Exhaust Ventilation
*   **I** - Isolation
*   **P** - Protective Devices (PPE)
*   **E** - Enclosure
*   **D** - Dust Control/Dilution

**Clinical Relevance:**
*   **Lead Poisoning:** Look for **Burtonian line** (blue line on gums), anemia, and wrist drop.
*   **Silicosis:** Associated with "Snow-storm" appearance on Chest X-ray. It predisposes to [[Tuberculosis]].
