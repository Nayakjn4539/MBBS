# [[Thanatology]] > Decomposition vs Putrefaction

### Definitions and Relationship

In the context of [[Thanatology]], these terms describe the disintegration of biological tissues after [[Somatic Death]].

*   **Decomposition:** The broad, umbrella term for the breakdown of complex organic body structures into simpler inorganic compounds. It is the net result of two distinct processes: **Autolysis** and **Putrefaction**.
*   **Autolysis:** Self-digestion of tissues by intracellular enzymes (lysosomes) released after cell death. It is an **aseptic** process (no bacteria involved).
*   **Putrefaction:** The breakdown of tissues caused by **bacteria** (mostly anaerobic) and fermentation. It constitutes the major visible aspect of decomposition.

### Comparison: Autolysis (Early Decomp) vs Putrefaction (Late Decomp)

| Feature | Autolysis (Self-Digestion) | Putrefaction (Rotting) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Agent** | Intracellular enzymes (released from lysosomes). | Bacterial enzymes (Exogenous and Endogenous bacteria). |
| **Main Organism** | Sterile process (No bacteria). | **[[Clostridium welchii]]** (produces Lecithinase), *E.coli*, *B. proteus*. |
| **Mechanism** | Breakdown of cells due to drop in pH and enzyme leakage. | Fermentation of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates by bacteria. |
| **Onset** | Starts immediately after cellular death (Molecular death). | Starts 12–24 hours after death (depending on climate). |
| **Key Signs** | Skin slippage, softening of viscera, clouding of cornea. | Greenish discoloration, bloating, foul smell, [[Marbling]], liquefaction. |
| **Effect on Organs** | Macroscopic structure lost, microscopy may be blurred. | Total loss of architecture; conversion into semi-fluid mass. |

### Mechanism of Putrefaction

Putrefaction is the final stage of death.
1.  **Bacterial Invasion:** Bacteria from the intestines (caecum) and respiratory tract invade tissues.
2.  **Enzymatic Action:** *Clostridium welchii* produces **Lecithinase**, which hydrolyses lecithin in cell membranes (including blood cells), causing massive [[Postmortem Haemolysis]].
3.  **Chemical Breakdown:** Proteins, carbohydrates, and fats are broken down into gases (H₂S, ammonia, methane) and liquids.

### Chronological Stages of Putrefaction

#### 1. Color Changes (12–24 Hours)
*   **Greenish Discoloration:**
    *   **Site:** Appears first in the **Right Iliac Fossa** (RIF) over the caecum.
    *   **Cause:** Hydrogen Sulphide (H₂S) produced by bacteria reacts with Hemoglobin (Hb) to form **[[Sulphmethemoglobin]]** (green pigment).
    *   **Progression:** Spreads to the whole abdomen, chest, and body. Eventually, the body turns blackish-green.

#### 2. Gas Formation and Marbling (24–48 Hours)
*   **[[Marbling]] (Arborescent Markings):**
    *   Bacteria spread through the venous system.
    *   Hemolysis stains the vessel walls, and H₂S turns the blood greenish-black.
    *   Superficial veins appear as a **spider-web pattern** of greenish/brown lines on the skin (shoulders, chest, thighs).
*   **Bloating:**
    *   Accumulation of gases (H₂S, CO₂, Methane) causes distension of the abdomen and scrotum/vulva.
    *   **[[Postmortem Purge]]:** Pressure from abdominal gases pushes the diaphragm up, compressing the lungs and forcing blood-stained frothy fluid out of the mouth and nostrils.
    *   **"Hercules Appearance":** Facial swelling, protruding tongue, and bulging eyes make the body look obese and unrecognizable.

#### 3. Liquefaction (Colliquative Putrefaction) (3–5 Days)
*   Soft tissues liquefy into a semi-fluid mass.
*   **Skin Slippage:** Epidermis separates from the dermis (glove and stocking fashion).
*   **Cavity Bursting:** Thoracic and abdominal cavities may burst open due to gas pressure.
*   **Loose Teeth/Hair:** Hair and nails detach easily; teeth become loose (Pink teeth phenomenon may occur due to protoporphyrin deposition).

### Factors Affecting Decomposition

**[[Casper's Dictum]]:**
This dictates the ratio of the rate of putrefaction in different media.
$$ \text{Air : Water : Earth} = 1 : 2 : 8 $$
*   1 week of putrefaction in **Air** = 2 weeks in **Water** = 8 weeks in **Soil** (Burial).

**Other Factors:**
1.  **Temperature:**
    *   Optimum: **21°C to 38°C**.
    *   Stopped at: < 0°C (Freezing) or > 48°C (Heat fixation).
2.  **Moisture:** Essential for bacterial growth. Bodies recovered from water decompose rapidly once exposed to air.
3.  **Cause of Death:**
    *   *Rapid:* Septicemia, kidney failure, edematous bodies.
    *   *Delayed:* Anemia, wasting diseases, poisoning by **Arsenic**, **Strychnine**, or **Carbolic Acid**.

### Modified Forms of Decomposition
If environmental conditions are extreme, normal putrefaction is replaced by:
1.  **[[Adipocere]] (Saponification):** Formation of grave wax in **wet/damp** conditions. Hydrolysis of fat into fatty acids.
2.  **[[Mummification]]:** Desiccation/drying of the body in **hot, dry** conditions with moving air.

### Autopsy Findings & Artifacts

#### Internal Findings
*   **Stomach:** Mucosa turns deep red/brown (postmortem gastromalacia). Can be mistaken for poisoning.
*   **Liver:** Becomes foamy and spongy due to gas bubbles. Known as **[[Honeycomb Liver]]** or "Foamy Liver".
*   **Brain:** Softens and turns into a pasty mass.
*   **Prostate/Uterus:** These are the **last organs to putrefy**, making them crucial for sex determination in decomposed bodies.

**Mnemonic for Order of Organ Putrefaction:**
**"S**ister **L**ily's **B**eautiful **H**eart **G**one"
*   **S**tomach/Intestine (First)
*   **L**iver
*   **B**rain
*   **H**eart
*   **G**one (Uterus/Prostate/Bone - Last)

#### Decomposition Artifacts (Medicolegal Masquerades)
Decomposition can mimic antemortem injuries:
1.  **Postmortem Purge:** Often mistaken for hemoptysis or bleeding from head injury.
2.  **Bloating:** Mimics obesity.
3.  **Greenish Discoloration:** Mistaken for bruising.
4.  **Gastric Rupture:** Gas pressure may rupture the stomach, mimicking traumatic rupture.
5.  **Rectal/Vaginal Prolapse:** Due to gas pressure, mimicking sexual assault.

### Medicolegal Importance
1.  **[[Time Since Death]] (TSD):** Estimated by the stage of putrefaction (e.g., green spot ~ 12-24 hrs, marbling ~ 36-48 hrs).
2.  **Identification:** Becomes difficult due to facial bloating and skin slippage.
3.  **Cause of Death:** Difficult to ascertain in advanced stages; excludes subtle signs of asphyxia or minor trauma.
4.  **Poisoning:** Some poisons (Alcohol, Cyanide) can be generated by putrefaction; others (Arsenic) retard it.
