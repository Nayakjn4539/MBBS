# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Contact tracing in STDs

### Contact Tracing in STDs

**Contact Tracing** is a fundamental intervention strategy in the control of [[Sexually Transmitted Diseases]] (STDs). It refers to the technique by which the **sexual partners** of diagnosed patients are identified, located, investigated, and treated.

#### 1. Objectives
*   To break the **chain of transmission** of infection in the community.
*   To prevent **re-infection** of the index patient (original patient) by an untreated partner.
*   To bring asymptomatic carriers (who serve as reservoirs) under treatment.

#### 2. The Process (The ILIT Protocol)
The procedure generally follows these steps:
1.  **Identify:** The patient (Index Case) is interviewed by specially trained staff/social workers to disclose the names and addresses of all sexual contacts.
2.  **Locate:** The health system attempts to locate these contacts. In some settings, rapid communication methods (like telephone) are used to reach them.
3.  **Investigate:** The contacts are persuaded to attend an STD clinic for medical examination and laboratory testing.
4.  **Treat:** Appropriate treatment is administered to the contacts.

> **Key to Success:** The success of contact tracing relies entirely on the **patient (Index Case)** voluntarily disclosing their sexual contacts. This often requires the ingenuity and persuasion skills of the STD social worker.

#### 3. Associated Strategies
To enhance the effectiveness of contact tracing, two related concepts are often employed:

**A. Cluster Testing**
*   **Definition:** Patients are asked to name other persons of either sex who move in the same **socio-sexual environment** (not necessarily sexual partners, but those with similar risk behaviors).
*   **Action:** These individuals are then screened (e.g., blood testing).
*   **Impact:** This technique has been shown to almost **double the number of cases found**.

**B. Epidemiological Treatment (Contact Treatment)**
*   **Definition:** Administration of the **full therapeutic dose** of treatment to persons recently exposed to STDs *while awaiting the results of laboratory tests*.
*   **Rationale:** To immediately interrupt transmission, as contacts may disappear or continue to spread infection while waiting for diagnosis.
*   **Constraint:** It must be combined with venereological examination and tracing of further contacts revealed by that examination to be lasting.

#### 4. Advantages and Limitations

| **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
| :--- | :--- |
| One of the **best methods** for controlling the spread of infection. | Relatively **expensive** to implement in areas with **low prevalence**. |
| Prevents complications in asymptomatic partners. | **Social stigma** makes patients hesitant to disclose names. |
| Reduces the "infectious pool" in the community. | Requires highly skilled staff to interview patients without judgment. |

### Clinical Relevance
In diseases like **Syphilis** and **Gonorrhea**, partners are often asymptomatic. If the primary patient is treated but the partner is not, the patient will simply get infected again (often called "Ping-Pong infection"). Therefore, treating the contact is as vital as treating the patient.

### Mnemonic
To remember the steps of Contact Tracing: **"I LIT"** the torch to find the contacts.
*   **I** - **I**dentify sexual partners
*   **L** - **L**ocate them
*   **I** - **I**nvestigate (Screening/Lab tests)
*   **T** - **T**reat (Epidemiological treatment)
