# [[Medical Law And Ethics]] > Medical Negligence

### Definition
[[Medical Negligence]] (Malpraxis) is defined as the absence of reasonable care and skill, or willful negligence of a medical practitioner in the treatment of a patient, which causes bodily injury or death of the patient. It essentially means doing something that one is not supposed to do (Act of Commission) or failing to do something that one is supposed to do (Act of Omission).

### Essential Components of Negligence (The 4 D's)
For a doctor to be held liable for negligence, the prosecution/plaintiff must prove the following four elements:
1.  **Duty:** The existence of a "duty of care" towards the patient. This begins the moment the doctor agrees to examine or treat the patient.
2.  **Dereliction:** A breach of this duty. The physician failed to maintain the standard of care expected of a "prudent physician" under similar circumstances (Bolam's Test).
3.  **Direct Causation:** The breach of duty must be the direct, proximate cause of the injury. (Causa Causans).
4.  **Damage:** Physical, mental, or financial injury/loss suffered by the patient. If there is negligence but no damage, there is no liability.

### Civil Negligence
This arises when a patient (or relatives) files a suit in a Civil Court or Consumer Court claiming compensation for injury/loss caused by the doctor's lack of reasonable care.

**Key Features:**
*   **Nature:** It involves a simple absence of skill or care. It is a tort (a civil wrong).
*   **Objective:** The aim is to seek compensation (Damages) for the injury or loss suffered.
*   **Burden of Proof:** Lies on the **plaintiff** (patient). The case is decided on the "preponderance of probability" (i.e., it is more likely than not >51% probability that negligence occurred).
*   **Jurisdiction:** Civil Courts or Consumer Disputes Redressal Forums ([[Consumer Protection Act]]).
*   **Liability:** The doctor is liable to pay monetary compensation.
*   **Example:** Failure to take an X-ray in a fracture case, plaster sore development, shortening of a limb after surgery.

**Sub-types of Civil Liability:**
*   **[[Vicarious Liability]] (Respondeat Superior):** The employer (hospital/senior doctor) is responsible for the negligent acts of the employees (nurses/junior doctors) committed during the course of employment.
*   **[[Res Ipsa Loquitur]]:** "The thing speaks for itself." In cases of gross negligence where the error is obvious to a layperson (e.g., leaving scissors in the abdomen), the burden of proof shifts *from* the patient *to* the doctor to prove innocence.

### Criminal Negligence
This arises when a doctor shows a gross lack of competence or gross inattention/inaction, resulting in serious injury or death of the patient.

**Key Features:**
*   **Nature:** It involves **Gross Negligence**, recklessness, or wanton disregard for the life and safety of the patient. It is a crime against the State.
*   **Objective:** To punish the offender for the crime.
*   **Burden of Proof:** Lies heavily on the **prosecution** (State). The guilt must be proved "beyond reasonable doubt" (99% certainty).
*   **Jurisdiction:** Criminal Courts.
*   **Liability:** Punishable by imprisonment, fine, or both.
*   **Legal Section:**
    *   **Section [[304A IPC]]** (Indian Penal Code): Causing death by rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide. Punishment: Imprisonment up to 2 years, or fine, or both.
    *   *Note regarding new laws:* Under the **Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS)**, this corresponds to **Section 106**.
*   **Example:** Amputation of the wrong limb, performing illegal abortion resulting in death, a drunken doctor performing surgery leading to death.

> **Supreme Court Guideline (Jacob Mathew Case):** To prosecute a doctor for criminal negligence, the negligence must be "gross" or "reckless." Simple lack of care is a civil liability, not criminal.

### Difference Between Civil and Criminal Negligence

| Feature | Civil Negligence | Criminal Negligence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Offence** | No specific violation of criminal law. A civil wrong (Tort). | Specific violation of criminal law (e.g., Sec 304A IPC). |
| **Degree of Negligence** | Simple lack of reasonable care and skill. | **Gross negligence**, recklessness, or incompetence. |
| **Initiated By** | Patient or relatives (Plaintiff). | Police/State (Prosecution). |
| **Court** | Civil Court / Consumer Forum. | Criminal Court. |
| **Burden of Proof** | On Plaintiff (Preponderance of probability / Balance of probabilities). | On Prosecution (Proof beyond reasonable doubt). |
| **Outcome/Punishment** | Monetary Compensation (**Damages**). | **Imprisonment**, Fine, or both. |
| **Role of Consent** | Consent acts as a good defense. | Consent is **NOT** a defense (Reason: No one can consent to grievous hurt or death). |
| **Contributory Negligence**| Available as a defense (may reduce compensation). | **NOT** a defense. |

### Medicolegal Aspects & Autopsy Findings

**In cases of death alleged to be due to Medical Negligence:**
1.  **Police Role:** Police should not arrest the doctor immediately unless there is prima facie evidence of gross negligence (Supreme Court Guidelines). An independent medical board opinion is often required.
2.  **Autopsy Objectives:**
    *   To determine the exact cause of death.
    *   To exclude natural causes (e.g., a patient dying of a massive heart attack during surgery, unrelated to the surgical procedure).
    *   To detect surgical/anesthetic mishaps (e.g., ligature slippage, internal hemorrhage, organ perforation, hypoxic brain damage).
    *   To recover foreign bodies (swabs, instruments).

**Autopsy Findings (Specific Examples):**
*   **Anesthetic Deaths:** Look for laryngeal spasm, pulmonary edema, or aspiration of gastric contents. **Viscera Preservation:** Brain, Liver, Kidney, Blood, and Urine must be preserved for chemical analysis to detect drug overdose or wrong drug administration.
*   **Surgical Mishaps:** Look for ligatures on incorrect vessels, perforation of intestines, or swabs left in the peritoneal cavity (gossypiboma). > [!warning] Diagram Alert

*   **Mismatch Blood Transfusion:** Look for renal tubular necrosis (kidneys) and hemoglobinuria.
