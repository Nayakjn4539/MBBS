# [[OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH]] > Sickness absenteeism

### Sickness Absenteeism

**Sickness absenteeism** is defined as the absence from work attributed to sickness. However, in practice, it is often a complex phenomenon where workers may declare themselves fit or unfit for work at their own choice. It serves as a useful [[index of health]] in industry to assess the state of health of workers, as well as their physical, mental, and social well-being.

High absenteeism impedes production, increases costs (direct and indirect), and reflects the "level of living" of the workforce.

### Magnitude of the Problem
*   **Incidence in India:** The rate of sickness absenteeism is reported to be **8 to 10 days** per worker per year.
*   **Percentage:** In registered factories, absenteeism has been found to be as high as **15% to 20%**.

### Causes of Sickness Absenteeism
It is implicit that only a small proportion of absenteeism is due to genuine sickness. The causes are multifactorial:

| Category | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Economic Causes** | If workers are entitled to **sick leave with pay** (e.g., under [[ESI Act]]), they tend to avail this privilege even if not genuinely ill. They view it as a right to be consumed. |
| **2. Social Causes** | Social and family obligations are major factors in India. These include: <br> • Weddings and festivals. <br> • Repair/maintenance of ancestral homes. <br> • **"Rural roots":** Workers from rural areas return to villages for sowing and harvesting seasons. |
| **3. Medical Causes** | • **Occupational accidents** account for only about **10%** of days lost. <br> • Common illnesses: Respiratory and alimentary tract infections. <br> • Epidemic diseases (e.g., Malaria). |
| **4. Non-Occupational** | • Nutritional disorders (Malnutrition). <br> • [[Alcoholism]] and drug addiction. |
| **5. Personal Factors** | Age, sex, separation from family, indebtedness, personality not fitting the job, and insufficient training. |

### Prevention and Control Measures
To maximize production and utilize resources efficiently, absenteeism must be reduced through the following measures:

1.  **Good Factory Management:** Efficient management practices and a safe working environment.
2.  **[[Pre-placement Examination]]:** Ensuring the right man is placed in the right job to prevent fatigue and disinterest.
3.  **Good Human Relations:** Improving the relationship between management and workers to reduce stress and dissatisfaction.
4.  **Application of [[Ergonomics]]:** Fitting the machine to the worker to reduce physical strain and injury.
5.  **Adequate Welfare Facilities:** Provision of crèches, canteens, and recreation helps resolve domestic worries (e.g., a mother worrying about children at home is prone to injury/absence).
6.  **Notification:** Proper reporting and analysis of records.

### Clinical Relevance: ESI Benefits
Under the **[[Employees State Insurance Act]] (1948)**, insured workers are entitled to **Sickness Benefit**.
*   This is a cash payment to compensate for loss of wages during sickness certified by an authorized medical officer.
*   **Benefit:** Approximately **70%** of average daily wages.
*   **Duration:** Payable for up to **91 days** in any continuous period of 365 days.
