# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Salmonellosis

# Salmonellosis

**Salmonellosis** is a major public health problem representing 60-80% of all reported cases of [[Food Poisoning]]. It is a complex group of foodborne infections affecting both man and animals.

### 1. Epidemiological Determinants

#### A. Agent Factors
*   **Agent:** **[[Salmonella]]** bacteria (Gram-negative rods). There are over 2,500 serotypes.
*   **Classification:**
    1.  **Strictly Human Pathogens:** *S. typhi*, *S. paratyphi A & C* (Cause [[Enteric Fever]], not considered zoonotic).
    2.  **Host-adapted:** *S. cholera-suis* (swine), *S. dublin* (cattle).
    3.  **Zoonotic (No host preference):** **[[S. typhimurium]]**, *S. enteritidis*. These are the **principal agents** of salmonellosis food poisoning. *S. typhimurium* causes >50% of human infections worldwide.
*   **Resistance:** They are hardy organisms. They resist **drying, salting, smoking, and freezing** (can survive for years in freezing).
    *   *Susceptibility:* Killed by heat (temperatures above 70°C).

#### B. Reservoir and Source
*   **Reservoir:** The main reservoir is the **intestinal tract** of man and animals.
*   **Animals:** Poultry, cattle, swine, rodents, dogs, and birds are naturally infected.
*   **Food Sources:** Primary source is food of animal origin:
    *   Commercially prepared meat and poultry.
    *   **[[Eggs]]** (can be infected directly through shell cracks or ovarian transmission).
    *   Milk and milk products (custards, sausages).
    *   Cross-contamination from raw ingredients to cooked foods in kitchens.

#### C. Host Factors
*   **Age:** Can affect any age, but death occurs primarily in **neonates, infants, and the elderly**.
*   **Immunity:** No specific immunity mentioned for food poisoning types.

### 2. Mode of Transmission
*   **Ingestion:** Consumption of contaminated food or drink (Main route).
*   **Direct Contact:** With infected domestic animals (dogs, pigeons) or rodents.
*   **Fecal-Oral:** Man-to-man transmission via the fecal-oral route.

### 3. Incubation Period
*   **Range:** 6 to 72 hours.
*   **Common:** **12 to 24 hours**,.

### 4. Pathogenesis
*   **Mechanism:** Ingestion of living organisms $\rightarrow$ Multiplication in the intestine $\rightarrow$ Production of enterotoxins/invasion $\rightarrow$ Acute [[enteritis]] and colitis,.

### 5. Clinical Features
The disease usually manifests as one of three syndromes:

#### A. Salmonella Gastroenteritis (Food Poisoning)
*   **Most common** manifestation.
*   **Onset:** Sudden.
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Nausea, headache, vomiting.
    *   **Profuse watery diarrhea** (usually lasts 2-3 days).
    *   Abdominal cramps.
    *   Low-grade fever (chills),.
*   **Outcome:** Usually resolves in 2-3 days. Stools may remain loose for weeks. Mortality is rare ($\approx$ 1%),.

#### B. Septicemia with Focal Lesions
*   caused by non-typhoid salmonellae (e.g., *S. cholera-suis*).
*   Invades bloodstream causing generalized infection or focal lesions like [[osteomyelitis]], meningitis, or endocarditis.

#### C. Enteric Fever
*   Caused by *S. typhi/paratyphi* (Discussed separately in curriculum).

### 6. Diagnosis
*   **Stool Culture:** Positive for Salmonella (may remain positive for weeks after recovery).
*   **Blood Culture:** Usually **negative** in gastroenteritis; **positive** in septicemia,.

### 7. Prevention and Control
Since it is a [[zoonosis]], prevention covers the entire food chain.

| Level | Measures |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Farm Level** | • Immunization of farm animals.<br>• Use of hygienic animal feed.<br>• Ensuring sanitary environment for animals. |
| **Processing** | • Hygienic slaughtering and milking.<br>• **[[Pasteurization]]** of milk and eggs.<br>• Proper disposal of wastes. |
| **Consumer/Personal** | • Thorough cooking (heat penetrates center).<br>• Avoid cross-contamination (separate raw and cooked foods).<br>• Hygienic food handling (hand washing).<br>• Rapid cooling/refrigeration of food (inhibit growth). |

> **Clinical Relevance:** **[[Multi-drug resistant]]** strains of Salmonella are increasing due to the widespread use of antimicrobial drugs in animal feeds. This limits treatment options for severe human infections,.

### Mnemonic: "SALMON"
*   **S**ources: Swine, Poultry, Eggs, Milk.
*   **A**nimal reservoir (Zoonotic).
*   **L**ow grade fever & Loose stools (Watery).
*   **M**ultiplication in gut (Infection, not just toxin).
*   **O**nset: 12-24 hours.
*   **N**o antibiotics usually (unless systemic/severe).
