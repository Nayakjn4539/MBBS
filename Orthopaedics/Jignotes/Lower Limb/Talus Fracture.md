# [[Lower Limb]] > Talus Fracture

# Fracture of the Talus (Aviator's Astragalus)

### **Introduction and Anatomical Peculiarities**
The [[Talus]] (also known as the Astragalus) is a unique tarsal bone that acts as a connecting link between the leg and the foot. It is the second most common tarsal bone to fracture (after the [[Calcaneum]]).

*   **No Muscle Attachments:** It is the only bone in the foot that has **no muscular or tendinous attachments**. It is held in place by bony and ligamentous support.
*   **Articular Surface:** Approximately **60% (3/5th)** of its surface is covered by [[Articular Cartilage]].
*   **Blood Supply:** It has a **precarious blood supply** (Retrograde blood flow).
    *   The vessels enter the neck and run proximally to supply the body.
    *   **Clinical Implication:** Fractures of the [[Talar Neck]] cut off the blood supply to the body, leading to a high risk of [[Avascular Necrosis]] (AVN) of the body.

### **Mechanism of Injury**
Injuries to the talus are usually the result of considerable violence (high-energy trauma).

*   **Forced Dorsiflexion:** This is the most common mechanism. The neck of the talus is impinged against the anterior margin of the [[Distal Tibia]], causing a fracture of the neck.
*   **Aviator's Astragalus:** Historically described in pilots during plane crashes where the rudder bar was driven forcibly against the sole of the foot, causing forced dorsiflexion. Currently seen in car accidents (pedals) or falls from a height.
*   **Associated Injuries:** Often associated with [[Malleolar Fractures]] or spinal compression fractures due to axial loading.

### **Classification of Talar Neck Fractures**
The **Hawkins Classification** is the standard system used to classify fractures of the [[Talar Neck]]. It is prognostic for the development of Avascular Necrosis (AVN).

| Hawkins Type | Description | Risk of AVN |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type I** | Undisplaced vertical fracture of the neck. | Low (0–13%) |
| **Type II** | Displaced fracture with **Subtalar** subluxation/dislocation. | Moderate (20–50%) |
| **Type III** | Displaced fracture with **Subtalar** AND **Ankle** (Tibiotalar) dislocation. | High (80–100%) |
| **Type IV** | Type III + Dislocation of the **Talonavicular joint**. | Very High (Approaching 100%) |

### **Clinical Features**
*   **Pain:** Severe pain in the ankle and hindfoot.
*   **Swelling:** Diffuse edema around the ankle.
*   **Deformity:** Visible deformity if dislocation is present. The skin may be tented by bone fragments, posing a risk for skin necrosis.
*   **Inability to bear weight.**

### **Imaging and Diagnosis**
*   **X-rays:**
    *   **Anteroposterior (AP) View:** Of the ankle.
    *   **Lateral View:** Essential to see the neck fracture and subluxation of the subtalar joint.
    *   **Mortise View:** To assess the ankle joint congruity.
*   **CT Scan:** Often required to define the fracture pattern, assess comminution, and plan surgical fixation.
*   **[[Hawkins Sign]]:**
    *   This is a **subchondral radiolucency** (osteopenia) seen on the dome of the talus on an AP X-ray, appearing **6–8 weeks** after injury.
    *   **Clinical Significance:** It indicates **revascularization** (bone resorption due to hyperemia). It is a **good prognostic sign** indicating the *absence* of Avascular Necrosis.

### **Management**

#### **1. Conservative Management**
*   **Indication:** Undisplaced fractures (Hawkins Type I).
*   **Method:**
    *   Short leg cast (Below-knee cast) or [[Boot Cast]].
    *   **Strict Non-Weight Bearing** for 6–8 weeks until radiographic evidence of union.
    *   Regular X-ray monitoring to ensure no displacement occurs.

#### **2. Operative Management**
*   **Indication:** Displaced fractures (Hawkins Type II, III, IV).
*   **Emergency:** If there is dislocation causing skin tenting or neurovascular compromise, immediate closed reduction is attempted to save the soft tissues.
*   **Definitive Surgery:** **Open Reduction and Internal Fixation ([[ORIF]]).**
    *   **Approach:** Anteromedial or Anterolateral approach (sometimes both to visualize the entire neck).
    *   **Fixation:** Anatomic reduction is crucial. Fixation is achieved using **Cannulated Cancellous Screws** (countersunk to avoid articular impingement) or K-wires.
    *   **Urgency:** Anatomical reduction is considered a "fracture of necessity" to restore blood supply and joint congruity.

### **Other Talus Fractures**
*   **Fracture of the Body:** Usually due to axial compression (fall from height). High risk of subtalar and ankle arthritis. Treated by ORIF if displaced.
*   **Lateral Process Fracture:** Common in snowboarders ("Snowboarder’s fracture"). Often missed as an ankle sprain.
*   **Osteochondral Fractures:** Involves the dome of the talus. Can lead to [[Osteochondritis Dissecans]].

### **Complications**

1.  **[[Avascular Necrosis]] (AVN):**
    *   The most feared complication due to retrograde blood supply.
    *   The body of the talus becomes sclerotic (dense white) on X-ray compared to the surrounding osteopenic bone (disuse atrophy).
    *   *Treatment:* Protected weight bearing; if collapse occurs, [[Arthrodesis]] (fusion) of the ankle or subtalar joint may be required.
2.  **[[Post-traumatic Arthritis]]:**
    *   Involves the Subtalar joint or Ankle joint.
    *   Due to cartilage damage at the time of injury or articular incongruity.
3.  **Malunion:**
    *   Varus malunion is common. leads to a locked subtalar joint and walking on the lateral border of the foot.
4.  **Non-union:** Rare, but difficult to treat.
5.  **Skin Necrosis/Infection:** Due to the thin soft tissue envelope and severe swelling.

### **Mnemonic for Hawkins Classification**
To remember the dislocations involved in Types II, III, and IV: **S-A-N**
*   Type II: **S**ubtalar dislocation.
*   Type III: **S**ubtalar + **A**nkle dislocation.
*   Type IV: **S**ubtalar + **A**nkle + Talonavicular (**N**avicular) dislocation.
