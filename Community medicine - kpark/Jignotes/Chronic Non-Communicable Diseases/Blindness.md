# Blindness and National Programme for Control of Blindness & Visual Impairment (NPCBVI)

Blindness is a significant public health problem in India, with the country carrying a large burden of the global blind population. The approach has shifted from merely "control" to "prevention of visual impairment," reflected in the renaming of the program to **NPCBVI**.

### 1. Definition of Blindness

There has been a recent update to bring the Indian definition in line with the WHO definition to ensure global comparability.

| Category | Definition | Visual Acuity (in better eye with best possible correction) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **WHO Definition** | Blindness | Visual acuity < **3/60** or corresponding visual field loss to less than 10° |
| **NPCB (Old)** | Blindness | Visual acuity < **6/60** |
| **NPCBVI (New)** | Blindness | Visual acuity < **3/60** (Adopted in 2017) |

**Important Terminologies for Viva:**
*   **Low Vision:** Visual acuity < 6/18 but $\ge$ 6/60.
*   **Economic Blindness:** Visual acuity < 6/60 (Inability to earn wages).
*   **Social Blindness:** Visual acuity < 3/60 (Inability to count fingers at 3 meters; social isolation).
*   **Manifest Blindness:** Visual acuity < 1/60.
*   **Absolute Blindness:** No Perception of Light (PL-).

### 2. Epidemiology of Blindness in India

*   **Prevalence:**
    *   Rapid Survey (2006-07): 1.05%
    *   **National Blindness & Visual Impairment Survey (2015-19): 0.36%** [[Prevalence Rate]]
*   **Target:** To reduce prevalence to **0.3% by 2020**.

#### Causes of Blindness in India (National Survey 2015-19)
The etiology has shifted significantly over the decades. Infectious causes (Trachoma, Smallpox) have declined, while age-related and lifestyle causes have risen.

| Rank | Cause | Percentage Contribution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **[[Cataract]]** | **66.2% (Major Cause)** |
| 2 | Corneal Opacity (Non-trachomatous) | 7.4% |
| 3 | Cataract Surgical Complications | 7.2% |
| 4 | Posterior Segment Disorders | 5.9% |
| 5 | [[Glaucoma]] | 5.5% |

*(Note: Refractive errors are the leading cause of **Visual Impairment**, but Cataract is the leading cause of **Blindness**).*

### 3. Epidemiological Determinants

*   **Age:** Prevalence rises sharply after age 50. Childhood blindness is often due to [[Vitamin A Deficiency]], congenital cataract, or [[Retinopathy of Prematurity]].
*   **Sex:** Higher prevalence in **females** (due to longer life expectancy and poorer access to surgical services).
*   **Location:** Higher in rural areas due to lack of specialized care.
*   **Occupation:** Industrial workers (injuries, welding flash), agricultural workers (corneal injuries/fungal ulcers).
*   **Socio-economic Status:** Poverty is both a cause and consequence of blindness ("Cycle of Poverty").

### 4. National Programme for Control of Blindness & Visual Impairment (NPCBVI)

*   **Launched:** 1976 (First country in the world to launch a national blindness control program).
*   **Status:** 100% Centrally Sponsored Scheme.
*   **Goal:** Reduce prevalence of blindness to 0.3%.

#### Objectives
1.  Reduce the backlog of blindness through identification and treatment.
2.  Develop comprehensive eye care facilities at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels.
3.  Develop human resources for eye care.
4.  Enhance community awareness (IEC activities).
5.  Secure participation of Voluntary Organizations/NGOs.

#### Revised Strategies
*   **Shift in Approach:** From "Eye Camp Approach" to **"Fixed Facility Surgical Approach"** (to reduce infection rates and improve quality).
*   **Decentralization:** Formation of District Blindness Control Society ([[DBCS]]).
*   **Comprehensive Care:** Focusing beyond cataract to include diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and childhood blindness.
*   **School Eye Screening:** Detection of refractive errors in children (5–15 years) and provision of free spectacles.
*   **Eye Banking:** Promotion of eye donation (Hospital Cornea Retrieval Programme).

#### Organizational Structure (Infrastructure Targets)

| Level | Facility/Infrastructure | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary** | **[[Vision Centres]]** | 1 per 50,000 population. Staffed by Ophthalmic Assistant/Optometrist. Refraction and screening. |
| **Secondary** | **Service Centres** | 1 per 5,00,000 population. District Hospitals/NGO hospitals. Cataract surgery and IOL implantation. |
| **Tertiary** | **Training Centres** | 1 per 5 million. Medical Colleges. Specialised surgery (Retina/Cornea). |
| **Apex** | **Centres of Excellence** | 1 per 50 million. Regional Institutes of Ophthalmology (RIO). Policy and Research. |

### 5. Vision 2020: The Right to Sight

A global initiative by WHO and IAPB (International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness) to eliminate **avoidable blindness** by the year 2020.

**Target Diseases (Global vs India):**
*   **Global (5 Diseases):** Cataract, Refractive Errors, Childhood Blindness, Trachoma, Onchocerciasis.
*   **India (7 Diseases):**
    1.  Cataract
    2.  Refractive Errors & Low Vision
    3.  Childhood Blindness
    4.  Trachoma
    5.  **Glaucoma**
    6.  **Diabetic Retinopathy**
    7.  **Corneal Blindness**

**Mnemonic for Vision 2020 Diseases:** **C**an **R**eally **G**ood **D**octors **T**reat **C**orneal **B**lindness?
*   **C** - Cataract
*   **R** - Refractive Errors
*   **G** - Glaucoma
*   **D** - Diabetic Retinopathy
*   **T** - Trachoma
*   **C** - Childhood Blindness
*   **B** - Blindness (Corneal)

### 6. Levels of Prevention in Blindness

#### 1. Primary Prevention (Health Promotion & Specific Protection)
*   **Vitamin A Prophylaxis:** Massive dose (100,000 IU at 9 months, then 200,000 IU every 6 months till 5 years) to prevent [[Xerophthalmia]].
*   **Measles Vaccination:** Measles is a precipitator of Vit A deficiency blindness.
*   **Occupational Safety:** Use of protective goggles in industries/welding.
*   **Control of Trachoma:** **SAFE** Strategy (**S**urgery, **A**ntibiotics, **F**acial cleanliness, **E**nvironmental improvement).

#### 2. Secondary Prevention (Early Diagnosis & Treatment)
*   **Cataract Surgery:** IOL (Intraocular Lens) implantation is the gold standard. High volume surgeries to clear backlog.
*   **School Eye Screening:** Correction of refractive errors (Myopia/Hypermetropia).
*   **Screening for Glaucoma/Diabetic Retinopathy:** Especially in high-risk groups (Diabetics, age > 40).
*   **Treatment of Corneal Ulcers:** Prompt antifungal/antibiotic treatment.

#### 3. Tertiary Prevention (Disability Limitation & Rehabilitation)
*   **Low Vision Aids:** Magnifiers, special books.
*   **Rehabilitation:** Blind schools, vocational training.
*   **Mobility Training:** Use of the white cane.

### 7. Clinical Relevance & Student Notes

*   **Cataract Surgery Rate (CSR):** Number of cataract operations performed per year per million population. A key indicator of program performance.
*   **[[Eye Banking]]:** Corneas must be collected within **6 hours** of death. Only the cornea is used, not the whole eye. **Eye Donation Fortnight** is observed from **25th August to 8th September**.
*   **Avoidable Blindness:** Comprises **Preventable** (e.g., Xerophthalmia, Trachoma) and **Curable** (e.g., Cataract, Refractive Error) blindness. Roughly 80% of blindness is avoidable.
