# Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT)

[[Oral Rehydration Therapy]] (ORT) is the administration of fluid by mouth to prevent or treat dehydration caused by diarrhea. It is considered one of the major public health breakthroughs of the 20th century because it is simple, inexpensive, and highly effective.

### **Physiological Basis (Mechanism)**
ORT is based on the principle of **Coupled Transport of Sodium and Glucose**.
*   Absorption of sodium across the intestinal mucosa is greatly enhanced if administered with glucose (2% concentration).
*   Water follows passively due to the osmotic gradient created by the absorption of sodium and glucose, thus correcting the fluid deficit,.

### **Composition of WHO Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS)**

The current standard is the **[[Low Osmolarity ORS]] (Reduced Osmolarity ORS)**. The older formula (Standard ORS) had a total osmolarity of 311 mmol/L, but the new formula (245 mmol/L) reduces stool output by 20% and vomiting by 30%,.

| Component | Quantity (grams/Liter) | Molar Concentration (mmol/Liter) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sodium Chloride** (NaCl) | 2.6 g | **Sodium**: 75 |
| **Glucose** (Anhydrous) | 13.5 g | **Glucose**: 75 |
| **Potassium Chloride** (KCl) | 1.5 g | **Chloride**: 65 |
| **Trisodium Citrate** (Dihydrate) | 2.9 g | **Potassium**: 20 |
| | | **Citrate**: 10 |
| **Total Weight** | **20.5 g** | **Total Osmolarity: 245** |,,

**Why Citrate instead of Bicarbonate?**
Earlier formulas used Sodium Bicarbonate. Trisodium Citrate is now used because:
1.  It makes the product **more stable** (longer shelf life),.
2.  It reduces stool output (direct effect on intestinal absorption).
3.  It corrects metabolic acidosis.

**Preparation:**
*   Dissolve the contents of one packet in **1 Liter** of clean drinking water.
*   Do not boil the solution after preparation.
*   Use within **24 hours**; discard any remaining solution,.

### **Types of Oral Rehydration Fluids**

1.  **Home Available Fluids (HAF):** Used in **Plan A** (No dehydration).
    *   **With Salt:** Rice water, Dal water, vegetable soup, buttermilk (lassi), weak tea.
    *   **Without Salt:** Plain water, green coconut water, unsalted soup.
    *   *Note:* Avoid sugary drinks (carbonated beverages, commercial fruit juices) as they cause osmotic diarrhea.

2.  **ReSoMal (Rehydration Solution for Malnourished):**
    *   Used specifically for children with **Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM)**.
    *   Has **lower sodium** (45 mmol/L) and higher potassium (40 mmol/L) compared to standard ORS to prevent sodium overload and heart failure in malnourished children,.

3.  **[[Super ORS]]:**
    *   Uses complex substrates like **rice powder/starch**, glycine, or alanine instead of glucose.
    *   **Benefit:** Provides more calories and further reduces stool volume by 25%.

### **Management of Dehydration (IMNCI/WHO Guidelines)**

The treatment is based on the degree of dehydration, classified into three plans.

#### **Assessment of Dehydration (Look, Feel, Decide)**

| Feature | **No Dehydration** | **Some Dehydration** | **Severe Dehydration** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Condition** | Well, Alert | Restless, Irritable | Lethargic, Unconscious |
| **Eyes** | Normal | Sunken | Very sunken and dry |
| **Thirst** | Drinks normally | Thirsty, drinks eagerly | Drinks poorly/Unable to drink |
| **Skin Pinch** | Goes back quickly | Goes back slowly (<2 sec) | Goes back very slowly (>2 sec) |
| **Treatment** | **PLAN A** | **PLAN B** | **PLAN C** |,

#### **Treatment Plans**

**1. Plan A: Treat Diarrhea at Home (No Dehydration)**
*   **Goal:** Prevent dehydration.
*   **3 Golden Rules:**
    1.  **Give extra fluid:** Breast milk, HAF, or ORS after every loose stool.
    2.  **Continue feeding:** Do not starve the child; give nutrient-rich food.
    3.  **When to return:** If child develops danger signs (fever, blood in stool, repeated vomiting, drinking poorly).
*   **ORS Volume:**
    *   < 2 years: 50–100 ml after each stool.
    *   > 2 years: 100–200 ml after each stool.

**2. Plan B: Treat Some Dehydration (at Health Facility)**
*   **Goal:** Correct dehydration using ORS.
*   **Dose:** **75 ml/kg** of ORS given over **4 hours**,.
*   If weight is unknown, use age-based estimates.
*   Reassess after 4 hours. If signs of severe dehydration appear, shift to Plan C. If no signs, shift to Plan A.

**3. Plan C: Treat Severe Dehydration (Urgent)**
*   **Goal:** Rapid rehydration.
*   **Treatment:** **Intravenous (IV) Therapy** immediately.
*   **Fluid of Choice:** **Ringer’s Lactate** (preferred) or Normal Saline.
*   **Dosage:** Total **100 ml/kg**.
    *   *Infants (<12 months):* Give 30 ml/kg in 1 hour + 70 ml/kg in 5 hours (Total 6 hours).
    *   *Older Children:* Give 30 ml/kg in 30 mins + 70 ml/kg in 2.5 hours (Total 3 hours),.
*   *Note:* Start ORS (5 ml/kg/hr) as soon as the patient can drink.

### **Adjuncts to ORT**

*   **[[Zinc Supplementation]]:**
    *   Recommended for all children with diarrhea > 2 months old.
    *   **Dose:** 20 mg/day for children > 6 months; 10 mg/day for infants 2–6 months.
    *   **Duration:** 14 days.
    *   **Benefit:** Reduces duration/severity of episode and prevents recurrence for 2-3 months,.
*   **Antibiotics:** Not routine. Only for Cholera, Shigella dysentery, Amoebiasis, or Giardiasis.

### **Mnemonics**

*   **Composition of ORS:** **"N-P-C-G"**
    *   **N**aCl (Sodium Chloride)
    *   **P**otassium Chloride
    *   **C**itrate (Trisodium)
    *   **G**lucose
*   **Assessment of Dehydration:** **"L-E-T-S"**
    *   **L**ook at condition (Lethargic/Irritable)
    *   **E**yes (Sunken?)
    *   **T**hirst (Drinks eagerly/Poorly)
    *   **S**kin pinch (Slow/Very slow)
