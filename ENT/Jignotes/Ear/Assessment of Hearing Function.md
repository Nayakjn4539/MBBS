# Assessment of Hearing Function

The assessment of [[hearing loss]] involves a systematic approach ranging from basic clinical tests to sophisticated electrophysiological measures. These tests determine the type (conductive, sensorineural, mixed), degree (mild to profound), and site of the lesion (cochlear vs. retrocochlear).

### 1. Clinical (Bedside) Tests of Hearing

These are screening tests performed in the outpatient department to qualitatively assess hearing.

#### A. Voice Tests
*   **Method:** The patient stands 6 meters away with the non-test ear occluded (tragal rub). The examiner whispers or uses conversational voice.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   Normal: Hears whisper at 6 meters.
    *   Conductive loss: Hears spoken voice better than whisper.
    *   Sensorineural loss: Difficulty hearing high-pitched whispers.

#### B. Tuning Fork Tests (TFT)
Tuning forks of frequencies **256 Hz, 512 Hz, and 1024 Hz** are used. **512 Hz** is the ideal frequency because it falls within the speech range and has a long decay time, while lower frequencies produce vibration sense and higher frequencies decay too quickly.

**1. Rinne’s Test**
*   **Principle:** Compares Air Conduction (AC) with Bone Conduction (BC).
*   **Method:**
    *   Place vibrating fork on the mastoid (BC).
    *   When sound stops, move it near the [[external auditory canal]] (AC).
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   **Positive Rinne (AC > BC):** Normal hearing or [[Sensorineural Hearing Loss]] (SNHL).
    *   **Negative Rinne (BC > AC):** [[Conductive Hearing Loss]] (CHL). Indicates an air-bone gap of at least **15-20 dB**.
    *   **False Negative Rinne:** Seen in severe unilateral SNHL. The patient hears BC via the transcranial transmission to the opposite healthy ear. Corrected by masking the non-test ear.

**2. Weber’s Test**
*   **Principle:** Tests lateralization of sound via bone conduction.
*   **Method:** Fork placed on the midline (forehead/vertex/teeth).
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   **Normal:** Heard equally in both ears.
    *   **Conductive Loss:** Lateralizes to the **Poorer/Diseased** ear (due to lack of ambient noise masking).
    *   **Sensorineural Loss:** Lateralizes to the **Better/Healthy** ear.
    *   *Mnemonic:* **SOCS** (**S**NHL to **O**pposite, **C**HL to **S**ame).

**3. Absolute Bone Conduction (ABC) Test**
*   **Principle:** Compares patient’s BC with examiner’s BC (presumed normal). It tests the cochlear reserve.
*   **Method:** The [[external auditory meatus]] of both patient and examiner is occluded (tragal pressure) to eliminate the "occlusion effect" and ambient noise.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   **Same as examiner:** Normal or Conductive loss.
    *   **Shortened/Reduced:** Sensorineural Hearing Loss.

**4. Other Tuning Fork Tests**
| Test | Method | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Schwabach’s** | Same as ABC but meatus **not** occluded. | **Lengthened**: Conductive loss.<br>**Shortened**: SNHL. |
| **Bing** | Fork on mastoid; alternately close/open ear canal. | **Positive** (sound fluctuates): Normal/SNHL.<br>**Negative** (no change): Conductive loss. |
| **Gelle’s** | Fork on mastoid; air pressure increased in canal using [[Siegel’s speculum]]. | **Positive** (sound decreases): Normal/SNHL.<br>**Negative** (no change): Ossicular fixation (e.g., [[Otosclerosis]]). |

### 2. Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA)
This is the standard subjective behavioral test for measuring hearing sensitivity.

*   **Frequency Range:** AC tested 250–8000 Hz; BC tested 250–4000 Hz.
*   **Intensity:** Measured in decibels (dB) HL (Hearing Level).
*   **Symbols:** Right ear (Red, O); Left ear (Blue, X).
*   **Masking:** Used to prevent "cross-hearing" (shadow curve) when there is a significant difference (40 dB for AC) between ears. Narrow-band noise is used.

**Audiogram Interpretation:**
1.  **Normal:** Both AC and BC thresholds < 25 dB.
2.  **Conductive Hearing Loss (CHL):** BC is normal, AC is depressed. **Air-Bone Gap (ABG)** > 10-15 dB.
    *   *Maximal conductive loss:* 60 dB (seen in ossicular interruption with intact TM).
3.  **Sensorineural Hearing Loss (SNHL):** Both AC and BC depressed. No ABG (curves run together).
4.  **Mixed Hearing Loss:** Both AC and BC depressed, but ABG is present.

**Specific Audiometric Patterns:**
*   **Carhart’s Notch:** Dip in BC at **2000 Hz** (seen in [[Otosclerosis]]).
*   **Acoustic Dip (Boiler’s Notch):** Dip in AC/BC at **4000 Hz** (seen in [[Noise Induced Hearing Loss]]).
*   **Cookie-bite Curve:** Mid-frequency loss (seen in congenital hereditary deafness).
*   **Low-frequency rising curve:** Early [[Meniere’s disease]].

**Calculation of Hearing Handicap (WHO):**
Average of thresholds at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz in the better ear.

### 3. Speech Audiometry
Assesses the patient’s ability to hear and understand speech.

*   **Speech Reception Threshold (SRT):**
    *   Minimum intensity at which **50%** of **Spondee words** (two-syllable words with equal stress, e.g., "Cowboy", "Icecream") are repeated correctly.
    *   SRT should be within 10 dB of the Pure Tone Average (PTA). Discrepancy suggests [[Functional Hearing Loss]].
*   **Speech Discrimination Score (SDS) / Word Recognition Score (WRS):**
    *   Percentage of **Phonetically Balanced (PB)** words (single syllable, e.g., "Pin", "Bus") correctly identified at 30–40 dB above SRT.
    *   *Normal/Conductive:* 90–100%.
    *   *Cochlear loss:* 60–80%.
    *   *Retrocochlear loss:* Very poor scores (0–50%).
    *   **Roll-over Phenomenon:** In retrocochlear lesions (e.g., [[Acoustic Neuroma]]), increasing loudness *decreases* the discrimination score.

### 4. Impedance Audiometry (Tympanometry)
An objective test evaluating the status of the [[tympanic membrane]] (TM), middle ear pressure, and ossicular integrity.

#### A. Tympanometry (Jerger’s Classification)
Measures compliance (mobility) of the TM against air pressure changes.

| Type | Graph Shape | Interpretation | Clinical Condition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A** | Peak at 0 daPa | Normal pressure/compliance | Normal ear |
| **As** | Shallow peak | Reduced compliance (Stiff) | [[Otosclerosis]], Tympanosclerosis |
| **Ad** | High/Deep peak | Hypermobile/High compliance | Ossicular discontinuity, Monomeric TM |
| **B** | Flat/Dome | No peak/No compliance | [[Otitis Media with Effusion]] (OME), TM perforation |
| **C** | Peak shifted negative (< -100) | Negative middle ear pressure | [[Eustachian Tube Dysfunction]] |

#### B. Acoustic Reflex (Stapedial Reflex)
*   Contraction of the [[stapedius muscle]] in response to loud sounds (70-100 dB above threshold).
*   **Reflex Arc:** CN VIII $\rightarrow$ Cochlear Nucleus $\rightarrow$ Superior Olivary Complex $\rightarrow$ Facial Nerve Nucleus $\rightarrow$ CN VII $\rightarrow$ Stapedius.
*   **Clinical Significance:**
    *   **Absent:** Otosclerosis (early sign), facial nerve palsy (proximal to stapedius branch), profound SNHL.
    *   **Recruitment:** Reflex present at low sensation levels (<60 dB above threshold) indicates **Cochlear pathology** (e.g., Meniere's).
    *   **Reflex Decay:** Reflex fatigues/disappears within 10 seconds. Sign of **Retrocochlear pathology** (e.g., Acoustic Neuroma).

### 5. Special Tests for Recruitment (Suprathreshold Tests)
Used to differentiate **Cochlear** (sensory) from **Retrocochlear** (neural) lesions.

| Test | Description | Cochlear Finding | Retrocochlear Finding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SISI** (Short Increment Sensitivity Index) | Ability to detect 1 dB increments in intensity. | High score (70-100%) | Low score (0-20%) |
| **ABLB** (Alternate Binaural Loudness Balance) | Compares loudness growth between ears. | **Recruitment present** (Loudness catches up) | No recruitment |
| **Tone Decay** | Ability to hear a sustained tone for 60 seconds. | Minimal decay (<25 dB) | **Significant decay** (>30 dB) |

### 6. Objective / Electrophysiological Tests

#### A. Otoacoustic Emissions (OAEs)
Sounds generated by the **Outer Hair Cells (OHCs)** of the [[cochlea]].
*   **Types:**
    *   *Transient Evoked (TEOAE):* Elicited by clicks. Used for screening.
    *   *Distortion Product (DPOAE):* Elicited by two simultaneous tones. Frequency-specific.
*   **Applications:**
    *   **Universal Newborn Hearing Screening:** First-line screening test.
    *   Differentiating Sensory (OAE absent) vs. Neural (OAE present) hearing loss (e.g., [[Auditory Neuropathy]]).
    *   Monitoring [[Ototoxicity]] (OAEs disappear before PTA changes).

#### B. Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry (BERA / ABR)
Records electrical potentials from the auditory nerve and brainstem in the first 10ms after stimulation.
*   **Waves (Mnemonic: ECOLI):**
    *   **I:** [[Eighth Nerve]] (distal).
    *   **II:** Eighth Nerve (proximal).
    *   **III:** **C**ochlear Nucleus.
    *   **IV:** Superior **O**livary Complex.
    *   **V:** **L**ateral Lemniscus (Most important/stable wave).
    *   **VI/VII:** **I**nferior Colliculus.
*   **Applications:**
    *   Threshold estimation in infants/difficult-to-test patients.
    *   **Retrocochlear Pathology:** Interaural Wave V latency difference **>0.2 ms** suggests [[Vestibular Schwannoma]].
    *   Screening babies in NICU (detects neural damage which OAE misses).

#### C. Electrocochleography (ECochG)
*   Measures electrical potentials of the cochlea (SP: Summating Potential and AP: Action Potential).
*   **Clinical Use:** Diagnosis of **Meniere’s Disease**. An **SP/AP ratio > 0.3 (or 30%)** indicates endolymphatic hydrops.

#### D. Auditory Steady State Response (ASSR)
*   Similar to BERA but uses continuous modulated tones.
*   Objective frequency-specific thresholds. Can measure severe-profound losses (>80 dB) which BERA cannot.

### 7. Pediatric Assessment
*   **Behavioral Observation Audiometry (BOA):** (0-6 months) Startle reflex, eye-widening.
*   **Visual Reinforcement Audiometry (VRA):** (6 months - 2.5 years) Child turns head to sound, reinforced by a lighted toy.
*   **Conditioned Play Audiometry:** (2.5 - 5 years) Child performs a task (e.g., put block in bucket) when sound is heard.

### 8. Tests for Non-Organic Hearing Loss (Malingering)
*   **Stenger Test:** Best for unilateral malingering. Based on the Stenger principle (sound presented to both ears is heard only in the ear with higher sensation level).
*   **Objective Tests:** BERA and OAE are definitive proof.
