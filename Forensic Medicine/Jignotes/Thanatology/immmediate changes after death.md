# [[Thanatology]] > immmediate changes after death

### **Immediate Changes After Death**

The **immediate changes** appearing after death indicate [[somatic death]] (clinical death). These are signs produced by the complete and irreversible cessation of the vital functions of the body, often referred to as **Bichat's Tripod of Life**.

The three components of the **Tripod of Life** are:
1.  **Coma:** Cessation of brain function.
2.  **Asphyxia:** Cessation of respiration.
3.  **Syncope:** Cessation of circulation.

These changes occur between **few minutes to maximum 30 minutes** after death.

### **1. Insensibility and Loss of Voluntary Power (Brain Function)**
This is usually the **earliest sign of death**.
*   **Loss of Consciousness:** There is complete insensibility.
*   **Loss of Motor/Sensory Function:** Complete loss of voluntary movements and sensation.
*   **Loss of Reflexes:**
    *   **Corneal Reflex:** Abolished.
    *   **Light Reflex:** Pupils become widely dilated and fixed (do not react to light).
*   **Loss of Muscle Tone:** Muscles become flaccid (Primary Flaccidity).
*   **EEG:** Shows a flat line (isoelectric).

**Exceptions:**
*   In cases of [[Suspended Animation]], reflexes may be depressed but not absent.
*   Pupils may be constricted in death due to **Organophosphorus** or **Opium** poisoning.
*   Pupils may not dilate if eye drops (miotics) were used prior to death.

### **2. Cessation of Respiration**
Breathing stops completely. The chest becomes immobile.
*   **Stethoscope:** Auscultation of the lungs reveals no breath sounds for a continuous period of **5 minutes**.

#### **Traditional Tests for Respiration**
These are of historical importance but may be asked in exams:
1.  **Feather Test:** A feather held before the nostrils does not move (flutter).
2.  **Mirror Test:** A cold mirror held before the nostrils/mouth shows no dimming (fogging) by moisture from breath.
3.  **Winslow's Test:** A saucer of water placed on the chest shows no ripples (indicating no chest movement).

### **3. Cessation of Circulation**
The heart stops beating, and blood flow ceases.
*   **Pulse:** Palpation of radial or carotid pulse reveals no pulsation.
*   **Auscultation:** No heart sounds are heard over the precordium for a continuous period of **5 minutes**.
*   **ECG:** Shows a flat line (asystole). This is the most reliable method.

#### **Traditional Tests for Circulation**
| Test Name | Procedure | Findings in Death |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Magnus Test** | A ligature is tied tightly around the base of a finger. | The distal part remains pale/white. (In life, it becomes congested/blue and swells). |
| **Diaphanous Test** | The hand is inspected against a strong light source. | The webs of fingers appear opaque. (In life, they appear scarlet red/translucent due to blood flow). |
| **Icard's Test** | Injection of **Fluorescein** dye subcutaneously. | No discoloration. (In life, the skin turns yellowish-green and eyes turn emerald green due to circulation). |
| **Fingernail Test** | Pressure applied to the fingernail bed. | No blanching or return of color (capillary refill absent). |
| **Heat Test** | Application of heat to skin. | No blister formation or true redness (no vital reaction). |
| **Artery Incision** | Small artery is cut. | No spurting of blood; only slow oozing of dark blood. |

### **4. Primary Flaccidity**
Immediately after somatic death, the muscles lose their tone.
*   **General Relaxation:** All muscles (voluntary and involuntary) become relaxed and soft.
*   **Jaw Drop:** The lower jaw falls due to gravity.
*   **Contact Flattening:** The muscles flatten over the areas of contact with the surface the body rests on.
*   **Sphincter Relaxation:** May result in the voiding of urine and feces or emission of semen (especially in hanging).
*   **Note:** During this stage, muscles may still respond to electrical or mechanical stimuli (molecular life persists). This stage lasts for **1–2 hours** until [[Rigor Mortis]] sets in.

---

### **5. Skin and Eye Changes**
#### **Skin**
*   **Pallor (Pallor Mortis):** The skin becomes ashen white and pale because circulation stops and blood drains from capillaries into deeper veins.
*   **Loss of Elasticity:** The skin loses its elasticity; wound margins do not gape if incised after death.

#### **Eye Changes**
*   **Tache Noire Sclerotique:** If eyes remain open, dust settles on the sclera, and fluid evaporates. This leads to the formation of a **brownish-triangular** discoloration on the sclera (exposed part) on either side of the cornea.
*   **Corneal Opacity:** Cornea becomes hazy and loses its luster.
*   **Kevorkian Sign ("Trucking"):** Segmentation of blood columns in the retinal vessels giving a "cattle-trucking" appearance. Seen via ophthalmoscope within minutes.
*   **Intraocular Pressure:** Falls rapidly. Eyeballs feel soft and sunken.

### **Medicolegal Importance**
1.  **Certification of Death:** Physicians rely on these signs (no pulse, no breath, fixed pupils, flat ECG) to legally declare a person dead.
2.  **Organ Transplantation:**
    *   **Kidneys, Liver, Heart:** Must be harvested immediately after circulation stops (or during [[Brainstem death]] with ventilation support) before [[Molecular death]] sets in.
    *   **Cornea:** Can be removed up to **6 hours** after death.
    *   **Skin/Bone:** Can be removed up to **24-48 hours** after death.
3.  **Prevention of Premature Burial:** Careful examination prevents misdiagnosis in cases of [[Suspended Animation]].

### **Mnemonic**
**"3 C's"** of Immediate Changes:
1.  **C**essation of Circulation (Heart).
2.  **C**essation of CNS function (Brain).
3.  **C**essation of C-respiration (Lungs).

Tests for Circulation: **"MID"** Night
*   **M**agnus test.
*   **I**card's test.
*   **D**iaphanous test.
