# Surgically Induced Necrosis of Sclera (Surgically Induced Scleritis)

## Overview
**Surgically Induced Necrosis of Sclera**, often clinically termed **Surgically Induced Scleritis (SIS)**, is a rare but potentially devastating complication following ocular surgery. It is a form of [[necrotizing anterior scleritis]] with inflammation. It typically presents as an aggressive necrotizing immune response at the site of surgical trauma.

## Etiology and Risk Factors
SIS can be triggered by various surgical procedures involving the sclera or conjunctiva. It may occur in patients with or without pre-existing [[systemic autoimmune diseases]] (e.g., Rheumatoid arthritis, Wegener's granulomatosis).

*   **Precipitating Surgeries:**
    *   **Cataract Surgery:** Including [[extracapsular cataract extraction]] and [[phacoemulsification]].
    *   **Strabismus Surgery:** Squint correction.
    *   **Pterygium Surgery:** particularly with the use of the "bare sclera" technique or adjunctive therapy.
    *   **Glaucoma Surgery:** [[Trabeculectomy]].
    *   **Retinal Detachment Surgery:** Scleral buckling.
*   **Adjunctive Agents:** The use of antimetabolites like [[Mitomycin C]] (MMC) during pterygium or glaucoma surgery is a significant risk factor for scleral ulceration and necrosis due to its toxicity and inhibition of wound healing.
*   **Mechanism:** The exact mechanism is unknown but is believed to be an autoimmune reaction triggered by surgical trauma, potentially precipitating an underlying systemic condition.

## Clinical Features
The onset is typically delayed, occurring within **6 months** postoperatively (usually within weeks).

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Pain:** Moderate to severe, deep, boring pain often radiating to the jaw or temple.
    *   **Redness:** Localized near the surgical site.
    *   **Photophobia** and lacrimation.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Necrotizing Scleritis:** Intense localized inflammation associated with areas of infarction due to [[vasculitis]].
    *   **Scleral Thinning:** The sclera becomes transparent and ectatic.
    *   **Uveal Show:** The underlying [[uveal tissue]] shines through the thinned sclera (bluish/dark appearance).
    *   **Ulceration:** Sloughing of scleral tissue.

## Differential Diagnosis: SIS vs. Infectious Scleritis
It is crucial to differentiate autoimmune SIS from infectious scleritis (post-surgical infection), as the treatments are diametrically opposite.

| Feature | Surgically Induced Scleritis (Autoimmune) | Infectious Scleritis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Etiology** | Autoimmune/Hypersensitivity | Bacterial, Fungal, or Viral invasion |
| **Appearance** | Necrotizing, thinning, avascular patches | Purulent exudates, infiltrates, abscess formation |
| **Discharge** | Watery | Mucopurulent or Purulent |
| **Response to Steroids** | Improves | Worsens significantly (rapid progression) |
| **Management** | Systemic Steroids + Immunosuppressants | Aggressive Antimicrobials + Debridement |

## Management
Management is aggressive to prevent globe perforation and loss of the eye.

### 1. Medical Management
*   **Corticosteroids:**
    *   **Systemic:** Oral steroids (e.g., [[Prednisolone]]) in high doses, tapered slowly.
    *   **Topical:** Topical steroid eye drops may be used as adjuncts.
    *   **Note:** Subconjunctival steroid injections are **contraindicated** as they may lead to further scleral thinning and perforation.
*   **Immunosuppressive Agents:**
    *   Indicated in non-responsive cases or necrotizing scleritis.
    *   Drugs: [[Methotrexate]], [[Cyclophosphamide]], [[Azathioprine]].
    *   Systemic [[NSAIDs]] (e.g., Indomethacin, Flurbiprofen) can be used for pain control and inflammation in milder cases.

### 2. Surgical Management
Required if medical therapy fails or if there is extensive scleral melting threatening the integrity of the globe.
*   **Scleral Patch Graft:** To cover the area of thinning/perforation.
*   **Amniotic Membrane Transplantation.**

**Clinical Implications:**
Any patient presenting with pain and redness at the site of previous ocular surgery (weeks to months later) must be evaluated for scleritis. If the sclera appears white/avascular (ischemic) rather than congested, suspect necrosis. **Rule out infection before starting high-dose steroids.**
