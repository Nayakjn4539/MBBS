# [[Pharynx]] > Acute and Chronic Pharyngitis

# Acute Pharyngitis

**Definition:** Acute inflammation of the mucosa and submucosa of the [[pharynx]], often involving the oropharynx, nasopharynx, hypopharynx, adenoids, and tonsils. It is one of the most common causes of sore throat.

## Etiology

Most cases are viral, but bacterial causes are significant due to potential complications.

| **Category** | **Pathogens/Causes** | **Notes** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Viral** (Commonest) | **Rhinovirus**, Adenovirus, Parainfluenza, Influenza, Coronavirus, Coxsackie virus, [[Epstein-Barr virus]] (Infectious Mononucleosis), HSV, CMV, HIV | Accounts for ~90% of cases in adults. |
| **Bacterial** | **Group A Beta-Hemolytic Streptococcus** ([[Streptococcus pyogenes]]) | Accounts for 30–40% in children; 5–10% in adults. Important to diagnose to prevent rheumatic fever. |
| | Others: *Corynebacterium diphtheriae*, *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*, *Chlamydia trachomatis* | Diphtheria causes membranous pharyngitis. |
| **Fungal** | *Candida albicans* (Thrush) | Seen in immunocompromised states. |

## Clinical Features

Symptoms vary based on severity and etiology.

### 1. Mild Infections
*   **Symptoms:** Discomfort in the throat, mild malaise, low-grade fever.
*   **Signs:** Pharyngeal congestion without lymphadenopathy.

### 2. Moderate to Severe Infections (Typical of Bacterial/GABHS)
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Severe pain in throat ([[Sore throat]]).
    *   **Odynophagia** (painful swallowing).
    *   Headache, malaise, and high fever (>38.3°C).
    *   Absence of cough or hoarseness (suggests bacterial over viral).
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Erythema:** Redness of the posterior pharyngeal wall, soft palate, and pillars.
    *   **Exudate:** White or yellow exudate on tonsils or pharyngeal wall.
    *   **Lymphadenopathy:** Enlarged and tender **jugulodigastric** lymph nodes.
    *   **Petechiae:** May be seen on the soft palate (common in GABHS and EBV).
    *   **Edema:** Swelling of the uvula and soft palate in very severe cases.

### 3. Specific Viral Presentations
*   **Herpangina (Coxsackie A):** Vesicular eruption surrounded by erythema on soft palate and pillars.
*   **Infectious Mononucleosis (EBV):** Exudative pharyngitis, generalized lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly.

## Diagnosis
*   **Clinical:** Centor criteria helps distinguish viral from bacterial.
*   **Throat Swab Culture:** Gold standard for diagnosing Group A Streptococci.
*   **Rapid Antigen Detection Test (RADT):** Highly specific (95%) but less sensitive than culture.
*   **Blood Counts:** Leukocytosis suggests bacterial; Lymphocytosis/atypical lymphocytes suggest viral (e.g., EBV).

## Management

### General Measures
*   Bed rest and plenty of fluids.
*   Warm saline gargles or pharyngeal irrigation.
*   **Analgesics/Antipyretics:** Paracetamol or Ibuprofen for pain and fever.
*   **Lignocaine viscous:** For severe dysphagia before meals.

### Specific Treatment
*   **Viral:** Symptomatic treatment only. Antibiotics are **not** indicated.
*   **Bacterial (Streptococcal):**
    *   **Drug of Choice:** [[Penicillin G]] (oral or IM benzathine penicillin) for 10 days.
    *   **Penicillin Allergy:** [[Erythromycin]] or macrolides.
    *   *Goal:* Prevents suppurative complications and rheumatic fever.

## Complications
*   **Local:** [[Acute Otitis Media]], Sinusitis, Peritonsillar abscess (Quinsy), Retropharyngeal abscess, Parapharyngeal abscess.
*   **Systemic (Post-Streptococcal):** [[Rheumatic Fever]], Acute Glomerulonephritis, Scarlet fever.

# Chronic Pharyngitis

**Definition:** Chronic inflammation of the pharyngeal wall characterized by hypertrophy of the mucosa, seromucinous glands, subepithelial lymphoid follicles, and muscular coat.

## Etiology (Predisposing Factors)

The condition is often secondary to other pathology.

**Mnemonic: M-P-I-R-E**
*   **M**outh Breathing: Due to nasal obstruction ([[Nasal Polyps]], [[Deviated Nasal Septum]], [[Adenoids]]) or habit. Air is not filtered/humidified.
*   **P**ersistent Infection: Chronic sinusitis (post-nasal drip), chronic tonsillitis, dental sepsis.
*   **I**rritants: Chronic smoking, alcohol, spicy food, chewing tobacco.
*   **R**eflux: [[Laryngopharyngeal Reflux]] (LPR) / GERD.
*   **E**nvironment/**E**xertion of Voice: Dust, fumes, industrial pollution. Faulty voice production (excessive throat clearing/hawking).

## Types and Clinical Features

Patients generally present with discomfort, "foreign body" sensation (**globus pharyngeus**), tired voice (**phonasthenia**), and a constant desire to clear the throat.

| **Type** | **Pathology** | **Clinical Signs on Examination** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Chronic Catarrhal** (Simple) | Chronic congestion with vessel engorgement and increased mucus. | • Dusky red congestion of posterior wall.<br>• Engorged vessels.<br>• Thickened faucial pillars.<br>• Uvula may be elongated/edematous.<br>• Frothy mucus coating. |
| **Chronic Hypertrophic** (Granular) | Hypertrophy of subepithelial lymphoid follicles. | • **Granular Pharyngitis:** Posterior wall studded with reddish nodules (lymphoid follicles).<br>• **Lateral Pharyngeal Bands:** Thickened and hypertrophied (lateral pharyngitis).<br>• Congested mucosa. |

## Treatment
1.  **Eradicate the Cause:** Treat sinusitis, stop smoking/alcohol, correct nasal obstruction (septoplasty/polypectomy), treat GERD.
2.  **Voice Hygiene:** Voice rest and speech therapy. Avoid habitual throat clearing.
3.  **Local Therapy:**
    *   Warm saline gargles (soothing effect).
    *   **Mandl’s Paint:** Applied to mucosa (contains iodine).
4.  **Cautery:** For Granular Pharyngitis. Lymphoid granules can be cauterized using 10–25% silver nitrate or electrocautery/diathermy.

# Specific Forms of Chronic Pharyngitis

## Atrophic Pharyngitis (Pharyngitis Sicca)
*   **Association:** Often seen with [[Atrophic Rhinitis]].
*   **Pathology:** Atrophy of mucosa and mucous glands leading to scanty secretion and crusting.
*   **Clinical Features:** Severe dryness, crust formation, foul breath (fetor), hawking.
*   **Signs:** Dry, glazed, parchment-like pharyngeal wall covered with crusts. The pharyngeal lumen appears capacious.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Remove crusts (alkaline sprays/irrigation).
    *   Potassium iodide (oral) to promote secretion.
    *   Mandl's paint.
    *   Treat underlying atrophic rhinitis (e.g., Young’s operation).

## Keratosis Pharyngis
*   **Definition:** Benign condition with horny excrescences on the tonsils, pharyngeal wall, or lingual tonsils.
*   **Signs:** White/yellowish dots (keratinized epithelium) projecting from follicles. Firmly adherent (cannot be wiped off). No inflammation.
*   **Treatment:** Reassurance; spontaneous regression often occurs. No specific treatment required.
