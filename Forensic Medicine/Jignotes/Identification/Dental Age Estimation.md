# [[Identification]] > Dental Age Estimation

### Dental Age Estimation (Gustafson's Method)

**Gustafson's method** (1950) is a microscopic technique used for the estimation of age in adults (usually above 21 years) based on physiological degenerative changes in the dental tissues. Since this method requires the extraction of a tooth and the preparation of a ground section, it is a **destructive technique** and is generally utilized only for the identification of deceased individuals or skeletal remains.

### Principle
Teeth undergo specific structural regressive changes as age advances. By quantifying these changes, the chronological age of an individual can be estimated using a regression formula.

**Selection of Tooth:**
*   **Best:** [[Anterior teeth]] (Incisors and Canines).
*   **Moderate:** Premolars.
*   **Worst:** Molars (Multiple roots make sectioning difficult).

**Procedure:**
1.  A tooth is extracted.
2.  A longitudinal ground section (approx. 0.25 mm thick) is prepared through the midline of the tooth (labiolingual plane).
3.  The section is examined under a microscope to evaluate **six** physiological changes.

### The Six Physiological Changes (Gustafson's Criteria)

Gustafson identified six retrogressive changes that correlate with age. Each parameter is awarded a score from **0 to 3** based on intensity.

| Criteria | Explanation | Reliability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A**ttrition | Mechanical wear and tear of the incisal or occlusal surface due to mastication. | Reliable, but influenced by diet/habits (bruxism). |
| **P**eriodontosis | Regression/recession of gingiva and periodontal tissue, exposing the neck and root of the tooth. | Moderately reliable. |
| **S**econdary Dentin | Deposition of new dentin inside the [[pulp cavity]], reducing its size. It is a protective mechanism against irritation. | Reliable. |
| **C**ementum Apposition| Continuous deposition of cementum layers at the root apex to compensate for tooth eruption/wear. | Reliable. |
| **R**oot Resorption | Destruction of the root surface (cementum and dentin), usually starting at the apex. | **Least Reliable** (often pathological). |
| **T**ransparency of Root | Dentinal tubules become filled with minerals (sclerosis), making the root translucent. Starts at the apex and moves coronally. | **Most Reliable** criterion (starts after 30 years). |

> **A**ny **P**erson **S**eeking **C**are **R**equires **T**reatment
> *   **A** - Attrition
> *   **P** - Periodontosis
> *   **S** - Secondary Dentin
> *   **C** - Cementum Apposition
> *   **R** - Root Resorption
> *   **T** - Transparency of Root

### Scoring System

Each of the six factors is visually graded:
*   **Score 0:** No change (seen in young teeth).
*   **Score 1:** Beginning of change.
*   **Score 2:** Obvious change.
*   **Score 3:** Maximum/Extreme change.

**Total Score (X) = A + P + S + C + R + T**

### Calculation of Age

Gustafson derived a regression formula correlating the Total Score (X) with Age:

$$Age = 11.43 + 4.56 (X)$$

*(Note: The constants 11.43 and 4.56 are specific to Gustafson's original European sample. Local population-specific regression formulas are preferred for higher accuracy).*

*   **Error Margin:** Approximately $\pm$ 3.6 to 7 years.
*   The error margin increases significantly in individuals above 50 years of age.

### Medicolegal Aspects and Limitations

1.  **Destructive Method:** Cannot be used in living individuals (except perhaps if a tooth is extracted for valid orthodontic/therapeutic reasons). primarily used for [[Identification]] of cadavers and skeletal remains.
2.  **Pathology vs. Age:** Pathological conditions (e.g., pyorrhea causing periodontosis or improper brushing causing attrition) can falsely increase the estimated age.
3.  **Transparency:** This is the single most accurate criterion. In cases of advanced decomposition, where other features are lost, transparency of the root (Solheim’s method) remains useful.
4.  **Pink Teeth:** In decomposed bodies, teeth may appear pink due to the seepage of hemolyzed blood into dentinal tubules (protoporphyrin deposition); this is an artifact and interferes with color-based assessment but not necessarily Gustafson's structural criteria.
