# [[Glaucoma]] > Visual Field Defects in Glaucoma

### **Visual Field Defects in Glaucoma**

[[Glaucoma]] is characterized by progressive optic neuropathy resulting in specific patterns of irreversible visual field defects that typically correspond to the damage of the [[retinal nerve fiber layer]] (RNFL) and the [[optic nerve head]].

### **I. Anatomical Basis of Field Defects**
The pattern of visual field loss in glaucoma is strictly determined by the anatomy of the [[retinal nerve fiber layer]] (RNFL) as it enters the optic disc.

*   **The Horizontal Raphe:** The nerve fibers are arranged such that superior and inferior fibers do not cross the horizontal midline. Consequently, glaucomatous defects typically **respect the horizontal meridian**,.
*   **Bjerrum’s Area:** This is the arcuate area extending above and below the [[blind spot]] between 10° and 25° from the fixation point. This area contains the arcuate nerve fibers, which are most susceptible to glaucomatous damage,.
*   **Macular Fibers:** The [[papillomacular bundle]] serving central vision is the most resistant to glaucomatous damage, explaining why central vision is preserved until the late stages,.

### **II. Progression of Visual Field Defects**
The natural history of progressive glaucomatous field loss generally follows a specific sequence.

#### **A. Early Changes**
1.  **Isopter Contraction:**
    *   This refers to a mild generalized constriction of the central as well as peripheral field.
    *   **Clinical Note:** This is the *earliest* visual field defect but is of limited diagnostic value as it is non-specific and can occur in other conditions (e.g., cataract, miosis),.

2.  **Baring of the Blind Spot:**
    *   This is the exclusion of the blind spot from the central field due to the inward curve of the outer boundary of the 30° central field.
    *   Like isopter contraction, it is considered an early change but is **nonspecific** and of limited diagnostic value,,.

3.  **Paracentral Scotoma:**
    *   This is the **earliest clinically significant** field defect,.
    *   **Appearance:** Small, wing-shaped scotomas appearing either above or below the blind spot in [[Bjerrum’s area]].
    *   **Location:** Usually not connected to the blind spot initially.

4.  **Seidel’s Scotoma:**
    *   With time, the paracentral scotoma elongates and joins the blind spot.
    *   **Appearance:** Sickle-shaped or comma-shaped scotoma,,.

#### **B. Established/Intermediate Changes**
5.  **Bjerrum’s (Arcuate) Scotoma:**
    *   Formed by the extension of Seidel’s scotoma in an area either above or below the fixation point to reach the horizontal midline.
    *   **Characteristic:** It typically respects the horizontal midline (does not cross it),.
    *   **Breakthrough:** Damage to adjacent fibers causes a peripheral breakthrough.

6.  **Roenne’s Central Nasal Step:**
    *   Created when the superior and inferior arcuate scotomas run in different arcs and meet to form a sharp **right-angled defect** at the horizontal meridian.
    *   This occurs due to unequal loss of nerve fibers in the upper and lower hemispheres,.

#### **C. Advanced/Late Changes**
7.  **Ring (Double Arcuate) Scotoma:**
    *   Develops when the superior and inferior arcuate scotomas join together, forming a complete ring around the central fixation area,,.

8.  **Peripheral Field Defects:**
    *   **Peripheral Nasal Step:** Resulting from unequal contraction of the peripheral isopter.

9.  **End-Stage Defects:**
    *   **Tubular Vision:** The visual field loss spreads centrally and peripherally, leaving only a small island of central vision.
    *   **Temporal Island of Vision:** This is the **temporal island** in the peripheral field. It is the **most resistant** part of the visual field and is the last to be lost before total blindness (No Light Perception),.

### **III. Summary of Defects**

| Stage of Glaucoma | Visual Field Defect | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Earliest (Nonspecific)** | **Isopter Contraction** | Generalized constriction of the field. |
| | **Baring of Blind Spot** | Exclusion of blind spot from central isopter; nonspecific. |
| **Early (Significant)** | **[[Paracentral Scotoma]]** | Small scotoma in Bjerrum's area; unattached to blind spot. |
| | **[[Seidel’s Scotoma]]** | Sickle-shaped; paracentral scotoma joins the blind spot. |
| **Established** | **[[Bjerrum’s Scotoma]]** | Arcuate defect extending from blind spot to horizontal raphe. |
| | **Nasal Step** | Step-like defect at the horizontal meridian due to asymmetrical damage. |
| **Advanced** | **Ring Scotoma** | Fusion of superior and inferior arcuate scotomas. |
| | **Tubular Vision** | Loss of all peripheral vision except central fixation. |
| | **Temporal Island** | Residual peripheral vision; last to disappear. |

**Clinical Implication:** Since central vision is preserved until the end, patients often remain asymptomatic until significant damage has occurred. This necessitates periodic screening for high-risk individuals.

### **IV. Diagnosis via Automated Perimetry (HFA)**

The **[[Humphrey Field Analyzer]] (HFA)** is the gold standard for static perimetry,.

**Diagnostic Criteria (Anderson’s Criteria) for Glaucoma:**
A visual field is considered glaucomatous if **any one** of the following is present on at least two consecutive tests:
1.  **Glaucoma Hemifield Test (GHT):** Outside normal limits (comparing upper and lower hemifields),.
2.  **Pattern Standard Deviation (PSD):** Has a value occurring in less than 5% of the normal population (P < 5%),.
3.  **Cluster of Points:** A cluster of 3 or more non-edge points in a typical location (Bjerrum's area) with sensitivity P < 5%, and one point with P < 1%,.

**Global Indices:**
*   **Mean Deviation (MD):** Indicates generalized depression of the field,.
*   **Pattern Standard Deviation (PSD):** Indicates localized field loss (scotomas); typically increased in early glaucoma,.
