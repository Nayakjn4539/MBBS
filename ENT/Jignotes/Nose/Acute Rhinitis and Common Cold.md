# Acute Rhinosinusitis (Common Cold)

**Definition:**
Acute non-specific rhinitis, commonly known as the **Common Cold** or [[Coryza]], is an acute inflammation of the nasal mucosa. Since the nasal mucosa is continuous with the paranasal sinuses, the term **[[Acute Rhinosinusitis]] (ARS)** is often preferred,. It is a contagious, viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory system.

### Etiology

**1. Causative Agents (Viruses):**
Viruses are the primary pathogens.
*   **[[Rhinovirus]]:** The most common cause (>50% of cases),.
*   **[[Coronavirus]]:** Accounts for 15–20% of cases.
*   **Others:** [[Adenovirus]], [[Parainfluenza Virus]], [[Respiratory Syncytial Virus]] (RSV), [[Influenza virus]], Enterovirus,.

**2. Predisposing Factors:**
*   **Environmental:** Exposure to cold, dampness, and sudden temperature changes.
*   **Climate:** High humidity or winter months.
*   **Physical:** Fatigue, lack of exercise.
*   **Host Factors:** Low immunity (e.g., Diabetes, HIV), nutritional deficiency, chronic nasal obstruction (e.g., [[Adenoids]], [[Deviated Nasal Septum]]), and chronic infections (tonsillitis, sinusitis),.

**Mode of Transmission:**
*   **Airborne:** Droplet infection via coughing or sneezing.
*   **Contact:** Direct contact or fomites.

### Pathology and Clinical Features (The 3 Stages)

The natural course of a common cold typically runs through three distinct stages,,:

| Stage | Pathophysiology | Clinical Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Ischemic / Prodromal Stage** | Initial vasoconstriction of nasal mucosa. <br>Incubation period: 1–4 days. | • Burning sensation at the back of the nose (nasopharynx). <br>• Dryness and itching of the nose. <br>• Sneezing. <br>• Patient feels chilly with low-grade fever,. |
| **2. Hyperemic / Reactive Stage** | Reflex vasodilation leads to mucosal edema and increased vascular permeability. <br>Turbinates become swollen. | • **Profuse Watery [[Rhinorrhea]]**. <br>• **Nasal Obstruction** (stuffiness). <br>• Anosmia/Hyposmia due to mucosal edema. <br>• Postnasal drip causing dry cough,. |
| **3. Stage of Resolution / Secondary Infection** | • **Resolution:** Ciliary function improves, edema subsides.<br>• **Secondary Infection:** Bacterial invasion occurs (Strep. haemolyticus, Pneumococcus, Staph.). | • Discharge becomes thick, yellow, or mucopurulent. <br>• Symptoms gradually subside. <br>• Usually resolves within 5–10 days (self-limiting),. |

**General Symptoms:**
*   Low-grade fever, malaise, body ache, and headache,.

### Diagnosis

*   **Clinical Diagnosis:** Based on history and physical examination.
*   **Anterior Rhinoscopy:**
    *   Mucosa appears red and swollen.
    *   Mucopurulent or watery discharge present in the nasal cavity.
*   **Investigations:** Generally not required for uncomplicated cases. Nasal smear may show neutrophils (if secondary bacterial) or eosinophils (if allergic).

---

### Differential Diagnosis

*   **[[Allergic Rhinitis]]:** Characterized by itching, paroxysmal sneezing, pale/boggy mucosa, and "allergic salute",.
*   **[[Vasomotor Rhinitis]]:** Excessive rhinorrhea without allergic basis.
*   **[[Influenza]]:** More severe systemic symptoms (high fever, myalgia).
*   **[[CSF Rhinorrhea]]:** History of trauma, unilateral clear watery discharge that does not stiffen a handkerchief (Reservoir sign).

### Treatment

Currently, there is no curative treatment; management is symptomatic and supportive.

**1. General Measures:**
*   **Bed Rest:** Essential to cut down the course of illness and isolate the patient.
*   **Fluids:** Plenty of fluid intake is encouraged.

**2. Medical Management:**
*   **[[Analgesics]]/Antipyretics:** Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) for fever and headache. Aspirin should be avoided as it increases viral shedding.
*   **[[Decongestants]]:**
    *   **Topical:** Xylometazoline or Oxymetazoline nasal drops (Use limited to 3-5 days to prevent [[Rhinitis Medicamentosa]]),.
    *   **Systemic:** Pseudoephedrine to relieve nasal obstruction and improve ventilation,.
*   **[[Antihistamines]]:** First-generation antihistamines (e.g., chlorpheniramine) may help control rhinorrhea and sneezing but cause sedation.
*   **Steam Inhalation:** Provides symptomatic relief.
*   **Saline Sprays:** Improves mucociliary clearance,.

**3. Role of Antibiotics:**
*   **Antibiotics are NOT indicated** for uncomplicated viral rhinitis.
*   They are prescribed only if secondary bacterial infection supervenes (indicated by mucopurulent discharge, high fever, or symptoms lasting >10 days),.

> **Clinical Implication:**
> Educate patients that "antibiotics do not cure the cold." Misuse leads to resistance. Antibiotics are reserved for **Acute Bacterial Rhinosinusitis (ABRS)**, characterized by "Double Sickening" (deterioration after initial improvement),.

### Complications

Although usually self-limiting, the infection can spread to adjacent structures,:
*   **Sinusitis:** Due to blockage of sinus ostia by edema (Viral RS progressing to Bacterial RS).
*   **[[Otitis Media]]:** Spread via the Eustachian tube.
*   **Tonsillitis / Pharyngitis.**
*   **Lower Respiratory Tract:** Bronchitis, Pneumonia (especially in elderly or immunocompromised).
*   **In Children:** Acute [[Laryngotracheobronchitis]] (Croup) causing stridor.

### Other Types of Acute Rhinitis

**1. Influenzal Rhinitis:**
*   Caused by [[Influenza virus]] A, B, or C.
*   More severe than common cold; high fever, malaise, joint pain.
*   Associated with necrosis of ciliated epithelium.

**2. Irritative Rhinitis:**
*   Caused by dust, smoke, ammonia, formalin, or acid fumes.
*   Immediate catarrhal reaction (sneezing, rhinorrhea) upon exposure.
*   Recovery depends on epithelial damage.

**3. Diphtheritic Rhinitis ([[Nasal Diphtheria]]):**
*   Caused by *Corynebacterium diphtheriae*.
*   Usually secondary to faucial diphtheria.
*   Features: Greyish, tough membrane on the floor of the nose/inferior turbinate; removal causes bleeding. Excoriation of the upper lip.
