# [[PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IN OBSTETRICS, PAEDIATRICS AND GERIATRICS]] > What do you mean by neonatal mortality? Why is it so important? Write in brief the components of essential newborn care with special reference to breast feeding.

### Definition of Neonatal Mortality

**Neonatal Mortality** refers to deaths occurring during the neonatal period, commencing at birth and ending **28 completed days** after birth. It is a specific indicator of the intensity with which endogenous factors (like low birth weight, birth injuries) affect infant life.

**Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR)** is calculated as:

$$ \text{NMR} = \frac{\text{Number of deaths of children under 28 days of age in a year}}{\text{Total live births in the same year}} \times 1000 $$.

It is further subdivided into:
1.  **[[Early Neonatal Mortality]]**: Deaths occurring during the first 7 days of life.
2.  **[[Late Neonatal Mortality]]**: Deaths occurring from the 8th day to the 28th day of life.

### Public Health Importance of Neonatal Mortality

Neonatal mortality is considered a critical indicator for the following reasons:

1.  **High Mortality Burden:** About 40% to 47% of all under-five deaths occur in the neonatal period.
2.  **Critical Window:** The risk of death is greatest during the first **24–48 hours** after birth.
3.  **Endogenous Factors:** Unlike post-neonatal mortality (which is largely environmental), neonatal mortality is driven by endogenous factors like [[Low Birth Weight]], prematurity, and congenital anomalies, making it the most difficult part of infant mortality to alter.
4.  **Reflection of Care:** It serves as a measure of the quality of antenatal, intranatal, and neonatal care services available in the community.
5.  **Preventability:** Nearly three-quarters of all neonatal deaths could be prevented if women were adequately nourished and received appropriate care during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postnatal period.

### Components of Essential Newborn Care (ENC)

The primary goal of [[Essential Newborn Care]] is to assist the newborn in adapting to the external environment and reducing perinatal and neonatal mortality.

**The Main Components include:**

1.  **Resuscitation (Clearing the Airway):** Establishment and maintenance of cardio-respiratory functions is the primary task immediately after birth. This involves clearing mucus/secretions and assisted ventilation if natural breathing fails within a minute.
2.  **Thermal Protection (Maintenance of Body Temperature):** Preventing [[Hypothermia]] is critical. The baby must be dried immediately, wrapped in warm cloth, and kept close to the mother (Skin-to-Skin contact) to maintain a temperature between 36.5°C to 37.5°C.
3.  **Prevention of Infection:** This involves aseptic practices, specifically:
    *   **Cord Care:** Cutting with a sterile blade and keeping the stump dry without applying any substance.
    *   **Eye Care:** Cleaning eyes and preventing ophthalmia neonatorum.
    *   **Skin Care:** Delaying the first bath (preferably after a week) to protect the vernix and maintain temperature.
4.  **Early Detection of Disorders:** Screening for congenital abnormalities and infections.

### Essential Newborn Care: Special Reference to Breast Feeding

Breastfeeding is the ideal form of infant feeding and crucial for survival.

**1. Early Initiation:**
*   Breastfeeding should be initiated **within one hour** of birth for normal deliveries.
*   For Caesarean sections, it should be initiated within **4 hours**.
*   Early initiation helps establishing "bonding" and prevents postpartum hemorrhage in the mother by releasing oxytocin.

**2. Colostrum Feeding:**
*   The first milk, **[[Colostrum]]**, secreted in the first few days, must be given.
*   It is rich in proteins and antibodies (**IgA**), acting as the baby's "first immunization" against respiratory and diarrheal infections.
*   Age-old customs of discarding colostrum are harmful and must be discouraged.

**3. Exclusive Breast Feeding (EBF):**
*   The infant should receive **only breast milk** for the first **6 months** of life.
*   No other food, drink, or even water is required or permitted, as breast milk provides all necessary nutrients and water.

**4. Feeding on Demand:**
*   The baby should be fed whenever it is hungry, day or night (approx. 8 times a day). This promotes milk secretion via the prolactin reflex.

**5. Advantages:**
*   **For Baby:** Prevents malnutrition, reduces risk of hypothermia and hypoglycemia, provides specific immunity, and promotes brain growth (higher IQ).
*   **For Mother:** Acts as a natural contraceptive (Lactational Amenorrhea Method), protects against breast/ovarian cancer, and is economical.

**6. Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI):**
*   Hospitals must follow the "Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding," which includes practicing **[[Rooming-in]]** (keeping mother and baby together 24 hours a day) and strictly avoiding feeding bottles or pacifiers.

#### Mnemonic for Essential Newborn Care: "WIPE"
*   **W**armth (Thermal protection)
*   **I**nfection Prevention (Clean cord, eyes, skin)
*   **P**atent Airway (Resuscitation)
*   **E**arly Breastfeeding

#### Clinical Relevance
In a community setting, the **ASHA** worker plays a vital role in Home Based Newborn Care (HBNC). She is responsible for visiting the newborn on days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42 to monitor weight, ensure exclusive breastfeeding, and detect danger signs like sepsis or hypothermia.
