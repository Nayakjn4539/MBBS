# [[Special Injuries]] > Medico-legal aspects of Burns

### **Medico-legal Aspects of Burns**

Burns are injuries produced by the application of heat, chemicals, electricity, or radiation. From a medico-legal perspective, the primary objectives are to determine the nature of the injury (simple/grievous), the manner of causation (accident/suicide/homicide), and whether the burns occurred before or after death.

---

### **1. Classification of Injury (Legal Aspects)**

Under the [[Indian Penal Code]], burn injuries are classified based on severity and outcome:

*   **Simple Injury:** Superficial burns that heal rapidly without permanent damage.
*   **Grievous Injury ([[Section 320 IPC]]):**
    *   Burns resulting in permanent **disfiguration** of the head or face (e.g., scarring, tattooing).
    *   Burns endangering life (typically **>30-40%** Total Body Surface Area or significant [[inhalation injury]]).
    *   Injuries causing the sufferer to be in severe bodily pain or unable to follow ordinary pursuits for a period of **20 days** or more.

### **2. Determination of Manner of Death**

The differential diagnosis between accidental, suicidal, and homicidal burns is critical.

| Feature | **Accidental** | **Suicidal** | **Homicidal** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Incidence** | Common (kitchen mishaps, children, epileptics). | Common (especially in India; dowry deaths). | Rare (usually to destroy evidence of another crime). |
| **Site of Burns** | Usually front, hands, or specific areas contacting heat. | Often total body involvement (90-100%) or accessible areas. | Variable; often associated with other injuries (head injury, strangulation). |
| **Accelerants** | Usually absent (unless stove burst). | Present (Kerosene/Petrol smell often distinct). | May be poured over the body/clothing. |
| **Clothing** | May be loose (catching fire). | Often soaked in inflammable liquid. | Usually soaked; evidence of struggle may be present. |
| **Scene** | Kitchen/Workplace. Door likely open/unbolted. | Closed room, doors bolted from inside. | Disturbed scene, signs of struggle. |
| **Associated Injuries**| Absent. | Usually absent. | Present (e.g., stab wounds, ligature marks). |

*   **Dowry Death ([[Section 304B IPC]]):** In India, death of a woman by burns within 7 years of marriage under suspicious circumstances requires investigation by a Magistrate.
*   **Postmortem Burning:** Homicidal victims may be burned after death to conceal identity or the cause of death (e.g., strangulation).

### **3. Antemortem vs. Postmortem Burns**

Differentiation is vital to determine if the victim was alive when the fire started.

| Feature | **Antemortem Burns** | **Postmortem Burns** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Line of Redness** | **Present** (Red Line). Indicates vital reaction. | Absent. |
| **Vesicles (Blisters)** | Contains **albumin/protein-rich** fluid with chlorides. Base is red/inflamed. | Contains air or water (little albumin). Base is dry/hard/yellow. |
| **Infection/Pus** | May be present (if survived for some time). | Absent. |
| **Soot in Airway** | **Present** in trachea/bronchi (Vital Sign). | Absent (usually stops at mouth/nostrils). |
| **Carboxyhemoglobin**| **Present** in blood (>10%). | Absent or negligible. |
| **Enzymes** | Increase in peripheral enzymes (histochemical reaction). | No enzyme reaction. |

**Mnemonic for Antemortem Burns: "RED"**
*   **R** - Red line (Hyperemia)
*   **E** - Enzymes increased
*   **D** - Dermis inflammation (Vital reaction)

### **4. Autopsy Findings**

#### **A. External Findings**
*   **Pugilistic Attitude (Boxer's Attitude):**
    *   The body assumes a posture of flexion at elbows, hips, and knees.
    *   **Cause:** Coagulation of muscle proteins leading to contraction. Flexor muscles are bulkier than extensors, causing flexion.
    *   **Medicolegal Significance:** It is a **heat artifact** seen in *both* antemortem and postmortem burns. It does **not** indicate a struggle or defense.
    *   > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Sketch showing flexion of limbs resembling a boxer's stance
*   **Heat Ruptures:**
    *   Splits in the skin caused by contraction of heated tissue.
    *   Usually seen over extensor surfaces and joints.
    *   **Differentiation:** Unlike lacerations/incisions, heat ruptures have no bleeding, no vital reaction, and intact vessels/nerves may span the gap.
*   **Clothing:** Presence of kerosene/petrol smell. Unburnt areas of skin where tight clothing (belts, corsets) protected the body.

#### **B. Internal Findings**
*   **Respiratory System (The "3 Cs" of Internal Signs):**
    1.  **C**arbon (Soot): Black particles mixed with mucus in trachea and bronchi. **Surest sign of life during fire.**
    2.  **C**arboxyhemoglobin ([[COHb]]): Cherry-red discoloration of blood and viscera. Indicates inhalation of CO.
    3.  **C**yanide: Increased levels in blood (from burning plastics/furniture).
*   **Gastrointestinal Tract:**
    *   **Curling's Ulcer:** Acute stress ulcers in the duodenum seen in delayed deaths.
    *   Mucosa may be congested.
*   **Brain:**
    *   May be shrunken, firm, and "cooked" (brick red/brown).
    *   **Heat Hematoma:** An artifactual collection of blood in the extradural space due to heat-induced rupture of emissary veins. It looks like "chocolate paste" or honeycomb, unlike the "currant jelly" clot of true [[Extradural Hemorrhage]].

### **5. Cause of Death in Burns**

1.  **Immediate (0-24 hours):**
    *   **Neurogenic Shock:** Due to intense pain.
    *   **Asphyxia:** Inhalation of smoke, CO, CO2, or laryngeal edema.
    *   **Hypovolemic Shock:** Fluid loss from burnt surfaces.
2.  **Delayed (Days to Weeks):**
    *   **Sepsis:** Most common cause in delayed deaths (e.g., *Pseudomonas*, *Staphylococcus*).
    *   **Renal Failure:** Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN) due to hypovolemia or toxin load.
    *   **Curling's Ulcer:** Hemorrhage/perforation.
    *   **Pneumonia/ARDS.**

### **6. Identification of Charred Bodies**

When the body is severely burnt (pugilistic, charred), identification becomes difficult but possible through:
*   **Odontology:** Teeth are highly resistant to heat. Dental records/implants are crucial.
*   **Resistant Organs:** Non-gravid uterus and prostate often resist putrefaction and burning longer than other organs, aiding sex determination.
*   **DNA Profiling:** Pulp of teeth or bone marrow can yield DNA even in charred remains.
*   **Radiology:** To detect old fractures, implants, or bullets.

---

### **7. Medico-legal Artifacts in Burns**

*   **Pseudo-ligature Mark:** In obese infants or adults, heat swelling of neck skin against a tight collar or natural skin folds can mimic [[Strangulation]] marks. Unfolding the skin reveals pale, unburnt skin in the crease.
*   **Heat Fractures:** Skull fractures due to steam pressure inside the cranium (often "exploded" outwards). Long bone fractures due to muscle contraction.
*   **Postmortem Blisters:** Decomposition blisters contain air/watery fluid with no vital reaction, unlike burn blisters.
