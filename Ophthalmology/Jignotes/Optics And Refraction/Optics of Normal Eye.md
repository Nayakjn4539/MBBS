# Optics of Normal Eye (Reduced Eye)

The optical system of the human eye is complex, consisting of multiple refracting surfaces (anterior and posterior surfaces of the [[Cornea]] and [[Crystalline Lens]]) and media with different refractive indices ([[Aqueous Humour]], [[Vitreous Humour]]). To simplify optical calculations and clinical applications, the concept of the **Reduced Eye** (Listing’s Reduced Eye) and **Schematic Eye** (Gullstrand’s) was developed.

## 1. Concept of the Reduced Eye
The **Reduced Eye**, proposed by Listing and Donders, treats the complex optical system of the eye as a **single ideal spherical refracting surface**. It simplifies the multiple cardinal points of the schematic eye into a unified system.

### Properties of Listing's Reduced Eye
*   **Single Principal Point (P):** The refracting surface.
*   **Single Nodal Point (N):** The optical center.
*   **Two Focal Points:** Anterior ($F_1$) and Posterior ($F_2$).
*   **Total Dioptric Power:** Approximately **+58.6 D** to **+60 D**.
    *   **Cornea Contribution:** Approx. +43 D to +44 D (Major refractive element).
    *   **Lens Contribution:** Approx. +16 D to +19 D.

### Cardinal Points Data (Standard Values)
All distances are measured from the **anterior surface of the cornea**.

| Cardinal Point | Symbol | Position (Distance from Anterior Corneal Surface) | Significance |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Principal Point** | **P** | **1.5 mm** behind anterior corneal surface | It is the theoretical single refracting surface. |
| **Nodal Point** | **N** | **7.2 mm** behind anterior corneal surface | Situated in the posterior part of the [[Crystalline Lens]]. Rays passing through N are undeviated (Optical center). |
| **Anterior Focal Point** | **$F_1$** | **15.7 mm** in front of anterior corneal surface | Parallel rays from inside the eye focus here. |
| **Posterior Focal Point** | **$F_2$** | **24.4 mm** behind anterior corneal surface | Parallel rays from infinity focus here (falls on the [[Retina]]). |

### Focal Lengths
*   **Anterior Focal Length ($f_1$):** Distance from Principal Point (P) to Anterior Focus ($F_1$) = **17.2 mm** ($15.7 + 1.5$).
*   **Posterior Focal Length ($f_2$):** Distance from Principal Point (P) to Posterior Focus ($F_2$) = **22.9 mm** ($24.4 - 1.5$).

## 2. Refractive Indices of Ocular Media
The refraction of light depends on the change in refractive index ($n$) between media.

| Medium | Refractive Index ($n$) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Air** | 1.000 |
| **Cornea** | 1.376 |
| **Aqueous Humour** | 1.336 |
| **Crystalline Lens** | 1.39 (mean) to 1.42 (nucleus) |
| **Vitreous Humour** | 1.336 |

**Note:** The greatest refractive power occurs at the **air-cornea interface** because the difference in refractive index is the largest here.

## 3. Axes of the Eye
Understanding the axes is crucial for explaining visual angles and strabismus.

### A. Optical Axis
*   **Definition:** A theoretical line passing through the center of curvature of the cornea and the center of the lens.
*   **Trajectory:** It passes through the center of the cornea (P) and the nodal point (N).
*   **Termination:** It meets the [[Retina]] on the **nasal side** of the [[Fovea]].
*   **Clinical Note:** In practice, the exact center of the cornea is hard to determine, so the **Pupillary Line** (line perpendicular to the cornea passing through the center of the pupil) is often used as a proxy.

### B. Visual Axis
*   **Definition:** The line of sight joining the **Object of Fixation**, the **Nodal Point**, and the **Fovea**.
*   **Significance:** It represents the path of light for central vision.

### C. Fixation Axis
*   **Definition:** The line joining the **Fixation Point** and the **Center of Rotation** (C) of the eyeball.

## 4. Visual Angles of the Eye
These angles quantify the relationship between the anatomical and functional axes of the eye.

### Angle Alpha ($\alpha$)
*   **Formed between:** [[Optical Axis]] and [[Visual Axis]].
*   **Crossing point:** At the **Nodal Point** (N).

### Angle Gamma ($\gamma$)
*   **Formed between:** [[Optical Axis]] and **Fixation Axis**.
*   **Crossing point:** At the **Center of Rotation** (C) of the eye.

### Angle Kappa ($\kappa$) - *Clinically Most Important*
*   **Formed between:** [[Visual Axis]] and the **Pupillary Line** (Central anatomical axis).
*   **Crossing point:** At the center of the **Cornea** (P).
*   **Normal Value:** Slightly positive (approx. $5^\circ$) because the fovea lies temporal to the optical axis.

#### Clinical Implications of Angle Kappa
Angle Kappa results in the appearance of a squint (Pseudo-strabismus) when no true deviation exists.

| Type of Angle Kappa | Appearance of Eye | Condition Associated | Clinical Diagnosis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Positive Angle Kappa** | Eye appears turned **Out** | [[Hypermetropia]] | **Pseudo-exotropia** (Apparent divergent squint) |
| **Negative Angle Kappa** | Eye appears turned **In** | [[Myopia]] | **Pseudo-esotropia** (Apparent convergent squint) |

> **Mnemonic for Angle Kappa:**
> **P**ositive Kappa = **P**seudoexotropia = **H**ypermetropia (Think **PH** value)
> **N**egative Kappa = **N**earsightedness ([[Myopia]]) = Pseudoesotropia

## 5. Gullstrand’s Schematic Eye vs. Reduced Eye
While the Reduced Eye is used for simple calculations, Gullstrand’s Schematic Eye is more anatomically accurate.

*   **Schematic Eye:**
    *   Has **6 Cardinal Points**: 2 Principal points, 2 Nodal points, 2 Focal points.
    *   Calculates the cornea and lens as separate refracting elements.
    *   Total Power: **+58.64 D**.
*   **Reduced Eye:**
    *   Combines principal and nodal points into single mean points.
    *   Used for locating the retinal image size and position.
