# [[Larynx]] > Tests for speech assesment

### **Clinical Assessment of Voice and Speech**

Evaluation of speech and voice disorders requires a multidisciplinary approach involving subjective perception, objective acoustic analysis, and visual examination of the [[larynx]].

#### **1. Perceptual Assessment (Subjective)**

These tests rely on the clinician's auditory perception to grade the quality of the voice.

*   **GRBAS Scale:**
    *   This is a widely used perceptual scoring system utilized by clinicians to grade dysphonia.
    *   Each parameter is scored on a scale of **0 to 3** (0 = Normal, 1 = Mild, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Severe),.
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   **G**rade: Overall degree of hoarseness or voice abnormality.
        *   **R**oughness: Irregularity of vocal fold vibration (perceived as harshness).
        *   **B**reathiness: Audible air escape due to incomplete glottic closure.
        *   **A**sthenia: Weakness or lack of power in the voice.
        *   **S**train: Excessive effort or tension during phonation (hyperfunctional state).

*   **Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs):**
    *   **[[Voice Handicap Index]] (VHI-10):** A questionnaire completed by the patient to assess the psychosocial, functional, and physical impact of the voice disorder on their daily life,.

> **Clinical Implication:** Subjective ratings help monitor progress during [[voice therapy]] and quantify the impact of the disorder on the patient's quality of life.

#### **2. Acoustic Analysis (Objective)**

These tests provide quantitative data regarding vocal fold vibration and stability using computer software. Ideally performed in a sound-treated room.

*   **Frequency and Amplitude Perturbation:**
    *   **[[Jitter]]:** Cycle-to-cycle variation in the **fundamental frequency** (pitch). It represents pitch perturbation,.
    *   **[[Shimmer]]:** Cycle-to-cycle variation in the **amplitude** (loudness). It represents loudness perturbation,.
    *   **Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio (HNR):** Measures the proportion of periodic signal (voice) to aperiodic noise (breathiness/roughness).

*   **Aerodynamic Assessment:**
    *   **[[Maximum Phonation Time]] (MPT):**
        *   The patient sustains the vowel sound /a/ for as long as possible after deep inspiration.
        *   **Normal values:**
            *   Males: 25–35 seconds.
            *   Females: 15–25 seconds.
        *   Reduced MPT indicates glottic incompetence (e.g., [[vocal cord paralysis]]) or poor respiratory support.

*   **S/Z Ratio:**
    *   Compares the duration of sustaining the voiceless consonant /s/ vs. the voiced consonant /z/.
    *   **Ratio > 1.4** suggests laryngeal pathology (glottic incompetence) because the vocal folds are not closing efficiently to utilize airflow during the /z/ sound.

> **Mnemonic for Acoustic Analysis:**
> **J**itter is for **F**requency (**J**ust **F**reaky).
> **Shimmer** is for **Amplitude** (**Shimmer**ing **Amp**).

#### **3. Visual Assessment of the Larynx**

Direct visualization is critical to assess the structure and function of the vocal cords.

**A. [[Indirect Laryngoscopy]] (IDL)**
*   **Procedure:** Uses a warmed laryngeal mirror placed against the uvula while holding the tongue,.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Deep inspiration: Assessment of **abduction**.
    *   Phonation 'Aa': Assessment of **adduction**.
    *   Phonation 'Eee': Assessment of **tension** and adduction,.
*   **Structures visualized:** Epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds, arytenoids, ventricular bands, true cords, anterior commissure, pyriform fossae, and base of tongue.

**B. [[Videostroboscopy]]**
*   **Principle (Talbot's Law):** The retina can only register 5 images per second. Vocal folds vibrate at 80–1000 Hz. Stroboscopy uses a flashing light synchronized slightly slower than the vocal fold frequency to create an optical illusion of "slow motion",.
*   **Utility:** It is the gold standard for assessing the **mucosal wave** and vibratory dynamics,.
*   **Parameters Assessed:**
    1.  **Symmetry:** Mirror image movement of both cords.
    2.  **Periodicity:** Regularity of vibration.
    3.  **Amplitude:** Horizontal excursion of the folds.
    4.  **Mucosal Wave:** A ripple-like motion on the surface.
    5.  **Glottic Closure Pattern:** Can be complete, hourglass (nodules), bowing (presbylaryngis/palsy), or irregular,,.

**C. High-Speed Video Imaging (HSV)**
*   Records up to 4,000–8,000 frames per second.
*   Unlike stroboscopy, it captures the **true** vibratory pattern, not a composite illusion. It is useful for aperiodic (highly irregular) voices where stroboscopy fails.

#### **4. Physiological and Electrical Tests**

*   **[[Electroglottography]] (EGG) / Laryngography:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Two electrodes are placed on the thyroid cartilage ala. A high-frequency current is passed.
    *   **Principle:** Tissue conducts electricity better than air. Impedance drops when vocal cords contact (closed phase) and increases when they separate (open phase).
    *   **Outcome:** Provides a waveform representing the contact area of vocal folds during the vibratory cycle.

*   **Laryngeal [[Electromyography]] (LEMG):**
    *   **Procedure:** Needle electrodes are inserted into laryngeal muscles (Cricothyroid or Thyroarytenoid).
    *   **Utility:**
        *   Differentiates between **mechanical fixation** (e.g., cricoarytenoid joint ankylosis) and **neurological paralysis**,.
        *   Distinguishes [[Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve]] (RLN) vs. Superior Laryngeal Nerve (SLN) injury.
        *   Useful for guiding Botox injections in [[spasmodic dysphonia]].

#### **5. Speech Audiometry**

While laryngeal tests assess voice *production*, speech audiometry assesses the auditory system's ability to *hear and understand* speech. This is crucial as hearing loss affects speech production and perception.

**A. [[Speech Reception Threshold]] (SRT)**
*   **Definition:** The minimum intensity (in dB) at which the patient can repeat **50%** of words correctly,,.
*   **Stimulus:** **Spondee words** (bi-syllabic words with equal stress, e.g., "Ice-cream", "Armchair", "Baseball"),,.
*   **Correlation:** SRT should be within **10 dB** of the Pure Tone Average (PTA) (average of 500, 1000, 2000 Hz),.
*   **Clinical Significance:** If SRT is significantly better than the PTA (>10 dB difference), it suggests **Functional Hearing Loss** (Malingering),.

**B. [[Speech Discrimination Score]] (SDS) / Word Recognition Score**
*   **Definition:** Measures the ability to understand speech at a comfortable loudness level (usually 30–40 dB above SRT),.
*   **Stimulus:** **Phonetically Balanced (PB) words** (single-syllable words like "pin", "bus", "day"),.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   **90–100%:** Normal or Conductive Hearing Loss.
    *   **60–74%:** Moderate difficulty (often seen in Cochlear pathology like [[Meniere's disease]]).
    *   **< 50%:** Very poor discrimination.
*   **Rollover Phenomenon:** A paradoxical decrease in discrimination score as sound intensity increases. This is a hallmark of **retrocochlear pathology** (e.g., [[Acoustic Neuroma]]).
