# [[Mechanical Injuries]] > Age of woundinjury

### Age of Wound/Injury

Determining the age of an injury is a critical aspect of [[Forensic Traumatology]]. It helps establish the correlation between the time of the alleged incident and the time of infliction of the injury. The estimation is based on the **Vital Reaction** (inflammation and healing process) occurring in living tissues.

The age of an injury is estimated based on macroscopic (color, scab, healing) and microscopic (histological/histochemical) changes.

### 1. Age of [[Abrasion]]

The healing of an abrasion occurs from the periphery towards the center. It primarily involves the formation of a scab (crust).

| Time Since Injury | Appearance/Changes | Pathophysiology |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fresh** | Bright red, oozing serum and blood. | Exposure of dermis/vessels. |
| **12 – 24 Hours** | **Reddish scab** forms. | Drying of oozed blood and lymph. |
| **2 – 3 Days** | **Reddish-brown** scab. | Polymerization of fibrin; drying. |
| **4 – 7 Days** | **Dark brown / Black** brownish scab. | Further drying and necrosis. |
| **> 7 Days** | Scab starts falling off from the margins. | Epithelium grows underneath the scab. |
| **10 – 14 Days** | Scab falls off completely. | Leaves a depigmented (pinkish) area (Hypopigmented). |

> * **S**cab dark/Black (4-7 days)
> * **S**hedding (7+ days)

### 2. Age of [[Contusion]] (Bruise)

The age is determined by the **color changes** resulting from the breakdown of hemoglobin in the extravasated blood. This is known as the **Rainbow Effect**.

| Time Since Injury | Color of Bruise | Pigment Responsible |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fresh (0 – 24 hrs)** | **Red** / Pink | Oxygenated Hemoglobin |
| **1 – 3 Days** | **Blue / Black** / Violet | Deoxygenated Hemoglobin (Reduced Hb) |
| **4 Days** | **Brown** | [[Hemosiderin]] |
| **7 – 10 Days** | **Green** | [[Hematoidin]] |
| **10 – 14 Days** | **Yellow** | [[Bilirubin]] |
| **2 Weeks** | Normal skin | Absorption of pigments complete |

> **Mnemonic for Bruise Color:** **IBGY** (Like VIBGYOR without the V, O, R initially)
> * **I**nitial (Red)
> * **B**lue (1-3 days)
> * **G**reen (7 days)
> * **Y**ellow (10-14 days)
> *Alternatively: **R**eally **B**ad **B**ruise **G**ets **Y**ellow (Red, Blue, Brown, Green, Yellow)*

**Important Exceptions:**
1.  **Subconjunctival Hemorrhage:** Changes from Red $\rightarrow$ Yellow directly (due to oxygenation through the thin conjunctiva). It does **not** pass through blue/green stages.
2.  **Dark Complexion:** Color changes are difficult to appreciate; rely on tenderness and swelling.
3.  **Site/Size:** Large bruises and bruises in areas with poor circulation heal slower.

### 3. Age of [[Laceration]] and [[Incised Wound]]

These open wounds heal by primary or secondary intention involving specific cellular responses.

| Time Since Injury | Gross Appearance | Microscopic/Histological Finding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fresh** | Bleeding, fresh clots. | Hemorrhage; no inflammation yet. |
| **12 Hours** | Edges red, swollen, adherent with blood/lymph. | Margination of neutrophils (Polymorphs). |
| **24 Hours** | Thin crust/scab; edges adhere. | Continuous layer of epithelial cells covers the surface; Monocytes appear. |
| **36 – 48 Hours** | Inflammation peaks. | **Capillary buds** begin to form (Angiogenesis); Macrophages prominent. |
| **72 Hours (3 Days)** | Wound feels firm. | **[[Granulation tissue]]** appears; Fibroblasts proliferate. |
| **4 – 5 Days** | Edges firmly united. | New collagen fibrils formed. |
| **1 Week** | Scar formation begins (Red/Pink). | Collagen dense; devascularization begins. |
| **Months** | Scar becomes white (pale) and soft. | Avascular, contracted scar tissue. |

### 4. Histochemical and Enzymatic Changes (Vital Reaction)

When macroscopic changes are not yet visible (early antemortem period), enzyme analysis at the wound site helps determine the age.

*   **Zone of Negative Vital Reaction (Central Zone):** The area immediately adjacent to the wound edge shows **decrease** in enzyme activity (due to necrosis).
*   **Zone of Positive Vital Reaction (Peripheral Zone):** The area slightly away (0.2–0.5 mm) from the edge shows **increased** enzyme activity (due to repair process).

**Timeline of Enzyme Appearance:**
*   **< 1 Hour:** Serotonin and Histamine increase (as early as 10 mins).
*   **1 Hour:** ATP-ase, Esterase, Aminopeptidase increase.
*   **2 – 4 Hours:** Acid Phosphatase, Alkaline Phosphatase increase.

### 5. Factors Affecting Healing (Age Estimation)

The timeframes mentioned above are averages. Healing can be delayed or accelerated by:
*   **Age:** Faster in children, slower in the elderly.
*   **Vascularity:** Face/scalp heal faster than legs/shins.
*   **Infection:** Sepsis delays healing and alters color changes.
*   **Pre-existing Disease:** Diabetes mellitus, anemia, clotting disorders, malnutrition (Vitamin C/Zn deficiency) delay healing.
*   **Therapy:** Steroids or anticoagulants alter the timeline.

### Medicolegal Aspects & Autopsy Findings

1.  **Corroboration:** Helps verify the victim's or witness's statement regarding the *time* of the assault.
2.  **Multiple Assailants/Events:** If injuries of different ages are found (e.g., fresh abrasion + yellow bruise), it suggests repetitive trauma (e.g., [[Battered Baby Syndrome]], domestic violence, or torture).
3.  **Antemortem vs Postmortem:**
    *   **Antemortem:** Signs of inflammation, vital reaction (enzyme changes), clot retraction, and color changes present.
    *   **Postmortem:** No inflammation, no color changes (except decomposition), no vital reaction.
4.  **Reconstruction:** Helps sequence the events if the victim sustained injuries at different times (e.g., a fight followed by a fall hours later).
