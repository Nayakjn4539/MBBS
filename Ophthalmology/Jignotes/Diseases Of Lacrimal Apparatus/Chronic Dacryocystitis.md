# Chronic Dacryocystitis

**Definition**
[[Chronic Dacryocystitis]] is a chronic inflammation of the [[lacrimal sac]], usually resulting from an obstruction of the [[nasolacrimal duct]] (NLD). It is more common than the acute form and is characterized by a vicious cycle of stasis of tears and mild infection.

---

### Etiology and Predisposing Factors

The etiology is multifactorial, generally involving factors that cause stasis of tears in the sac, leading to secondary infection.

| Factor | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Age** | Most common between **40 and 60 years** of age. |
| **Sex** | Predominantly affects **females (80%)**. <br>*Reason:* The bony canal is comparatively narrower in females. |
| **Race** | More common in Whites than Negroes (Negroes have a shorter, wider, and less sinuous nasolacrimal canal). |
| **Socio-economic** | More common in low socio-economic groups due to poor hygiene. |
| **Anatomical** | Congenital anomalies of the duct, excessive membranous folds in the NLD. |
| **Nasal Pathology** | Hypertrophied inferior turbinate, deviated nasal septum (DNS), nasal polyps, or [[atrophic rhinitis]]. |

**Causative Organisms:**
*   **Most Common:** [[Staphylococcus aureus]], [[Streptococcus pneumoniae]], *Streptococcus hemolyticus*.
*   **Gram-negative:** [[Pseudomonas pyocyanea]] (often produces greenish discharge).
*   **Chronic Granulomatous (Rare):** Tuberculosis, Syphilis, Leprosy, Rhinosporidiosis, Fungus.

### Clinical Features and Stages

The disease typically progresses through four clinical stages. The cardinal symptom is **Epiphora** (watering) aggravated by wind or cold.

#### 1. Stage of Chronic Catarrhal Dacryocystitis
*   **Symptoms:** Only persistent watering (epiphora) and mild redness at the inner canthus.
*   **Signs:** No overt swelling.
*   **Regurgitation Test:** Positive. Pressing over the sac area causes reflux of **clear or mucoid fluid** mixed with flakes.
*   **Syringing:** NLD is blocked.

#### 2. Stage of Lacrimal Mucocele
*   **Pathology:** Chronic stagnation leads to distension of the [[lacrimal sac]]. The sac fills with mucoid material.
*   **Signs:** A cystic, non-tender swelling appears below the medial canthus (below the medial palpebral ligament).
*   **Regurgitation Test:** Positive. Pressure yields **milky or gelatinous mucoid fluid**.
*   **Special Condition: [[Encysted Mucocele]]**
    *   Occurs if the openings of both canaliculi into the sac get blocked.
    *   **Sign:** A large fluctuant swelling at the inner canthus.
    *   **Test:** **Negative Regurgitation Test** (fluid cannot empty into the conjunctival sac).

#### 3. Stage of Chronic Suppurative Dacryocystitis
*   **Pathology:** Secondary pyogenic infection converts the mucocele into a **Pyocoele**.
*   **Signs:** Swelling becomes redder; associated recurrent [[conjunctivitis]].
*   **Regurgitation Test:** Positive. Frank **purulent discharge** (pus) regurgitates.

#### 4. Stage of Chronic Fibrotic Sac
*   **Pathology:** Long-standing low-grade infection leads to fibrosis and thickening of the mucosa.
*   **Signs:** The sac becomes small and shrunken (fibrotic).
*   **Symptoms:** Persistent epiphora and discharge.
*   **Imaging:** [[Dacryocystography]] shows a small, irregular sac.

### Complications

If left untreated, chronic dacryocystitis can lead to:
1.  **Ocular:**
    *   Chronic intractable [[conjunctivitis]].
    *   **Hypopyon Corneal Ulcer** (Ulcus Serpens): A minor abrasion can get infected by pneumococci from the sac causing a dangerous ulcer.
    *   **Endophthalmitis:** High risk if intraocular surgery (like cataract) is performed without treating the sac.
2.  **Lids:** Eczema of the lower lid skin, [[Ectropion]] (due to constant wiping).
3.  **Local:** Acute on chronic dacryocystitis (leading to lacrimal abscess or fistula).

---

### Diagnosis and Investigations

1.  **Regurgitation Test (ROPLAS):** Regurgitation on Pressure over Lacrimal Sac.
    *   Positive: Mucopurulent reflux indicating NLD block.
    *   Negative: Does not rule out dacryocystitis (e.g., Encysted mucocele, internal fistula).
2.  **[[Lacrimal Syringing]]:**
    *   Saline flows to nose: Patent.
    *   Regurgitation from same punctum: Canalicular block.
    *   Regurgitation from opposite punctum: NLD block.
3.  **Dacryocystography (DCG):** To visualize the size of the sac and site of obstruction (useful for tumours/diverticula).
4.  **[[Dacryoscintillography]]:** Functional assessment using radioactive tracers (Technetium-99m).

> **Clinical Implication:** **"Regurgitation Test"** is a mandatory bedside test before any intraocular surgery. A positive test is an absolute contraindication for surgery until the sac is treated.

### Treatment

Treatment depends on the stage and patient factors. Conservative treatment (antibiotics/probing) is rarely effective in adults.

#### 1. Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR)
*   **Status:** **Operation of choice.**
*   **Principle:** Creates a fistula (anastomosis) between the [[lacrimal sac]] and the middle meatus of the nose, bypassing the blocked NLD.
*   **Types:**
    *   **External DCR:** Via skin incision. High success rate (~95%).
    *   **Endonasal DCR:** Via nasal endoscopy. No skin scar, faster recovery, but expensive equipment needed.
    *   **Laser DCR:** Using Holmium-YAG laser (less successful).

#### 2. Dacryocystectomy (DCT)
*   **Definition:** Complete surgical excision of the lacrimal sac.
*   **Outcome:** Cures infection but **epiphora (watering) persists** permanently.
*   **Indications for DCT:** (When DCR is contraindicated)
    *   **T** - **Tumours** of the lacrimal sac.
    *   **T** - **TB** / Syphilis / Leprosy / Fungal infection of the sac.
    *   **A** - **Atrophic Rhinitis** (Gross nasal pathology).
    *   **O** - **Old age** (Extreme age where nasal mucosa is atrophic).
    *   **S** - **Shrunken** / Fibrosed sac (technically difficult to make flaps for DCR).

**Mnemonic for DCT Indications:** **"T-TOAS"** (Tumor, TB, Old age, Atrophic rhinitis, Shrunken sac).

#### 3. Conjunctivodacryocystorhinostomy (CDCR)
*   **Indication:** When both canaliculi are blocked along with NLD block.
*   **Procedure:** A Pyrex glass tube (**Jones Tube**) is placed connecting the conjunctival sac directly to the nasal cavity.

### Comparison: DCR vs DCT

| Feature | [[Dacryocystorhinostomy]] (DCR) | [[Dacryocystectomy]] (DCT) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Aim** | Re-establish drainage pathway | Remove the source of infection |
| **Epiphora** | Cured (patient is happy) | Persists (Patient unhappy) |
| **Infection** | Cured | Cured |
| **Age Group** | Young and middle-aged | Very elderly / Complicated cases |
| **Contraindications** | Atrophic rhinitis, Sac tumours | None generally (except bleeding disorders) |
