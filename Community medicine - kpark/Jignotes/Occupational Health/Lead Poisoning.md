# [[Occupational Health]] > Lead Poisoning

# Lead Poisoning (Plumbism)

**Lead poisoning**, also known as **[[Plumbism]]**, **Saturnism**, or **Painter's Colic**, is the most important cumulative poison in occupational health. Lead is widely used in industries because of its properties like low boiling point, anticorrosive nature, and ability to mix easily to form alloys.

### **1. Sources of Exposure**
Lead exposure occurs in both occupational and non-occupational settings.

**A. Occupational Sources (High Risk Industries):**
*   **Battery Industry:** Manufacture of storage batteries.
*   **Printing:** Handling lead type in printing presses.
*   **Pottery:** Glazing processes.
*   **Painting:** Manufacture and use of paints, colors, and dyes.
*   **Smelting:** Lead mining and smelting.
*   **Others:** Ship breaking, glass manufacture, plumbing, soldering, and manufacturing of rubber.

**B. Non-Occupational Sources:**
*   **[[Gasoline]] (Petrol):** Automobile exhaust is the greatest source of environmental lead (due to lead tetra-methyl used as an anti-knocking agent).
*   Drinking water from lead pipes.
*   Chewing lead paint on toys or window sills (common in children).

### **2. Modes of Absorption**
1.  **[[Inhalation]]:** This is the **most common mode** of absorption in industries. Fumes and dust are inhaled into the lungs.
2.  **Ingestion:** Less common occupationally. Occurs through contaminated hands (lack of hygiene), food, or drink.
3.  **Skin Absorption:** Inorganic lead is **not** absorbed through intact skin. However, **Organic lead compounds** (e.g., [[tetraethyl lead]]) can be absorbed through the skin.

### **3. Pathogenesis**
*   **Distribution:** 90% of ingested lead is excreted in feces. The absorbed lead enters the blood (95% in RBCs), moves to the liver/kidneys, and is finally deposited in the **bones**.
*   **Mechanism:** Lead combines with sulfhydryl (SH) groups of enzymes, interfering with **[[Heme synthesis]]** (causing anemia) and carbohydrate metabolism.

### **4. Clinical Picture**
The clinical presentation depends on the type of lead compound.

**A. Inorganic Lead Poisoning (Classic Plumbism):**
*   **Facial Pallor:** The **earliest and most consistent sign**. It is distinct from anemia and is due to vasospasm of facial arterioles.
*   **Anemia:** Microcytic hypochromic anemia.
*   **[[Burtonian Line]]:** A blue line on the gums (upper jaw) caused by lead sulfide deposition.
*   **Lead Colic (Painter’s Colic):** Severe abdominal pain, typically associated with obstinate **constipation**.
*   **Lead Palsy (Neuropathy):** Motor paralysis affecting extensor muscles.
    *   **[[Wrist drop]]** is a classical sign.
    *   Foot drop may also occur.
*   **Reproductive effects:** Sterility, abortion, and stillbirths.

**B. Organic Lead Poisoning:**
*   Mainly affects the **Central Nervous System**.
*   Symptoms: Insomnia, headache, mental confusion, delirium, and **[[Lead Encephalopathy]]**.

### **Mnemonic for Clinical Features: "ABCDE"**
*   **A** - **A**nemia (Microcytic) / **A**bortion
*   **B** - **B**urtonian Line (Blue line on gums) / **B**asophilic Stippling
*   **C** - **C**olic (Severe abdominal pain + Constipation)
*   **D** - **D**rop (Wrist drop/Foot drop)
*   **E** - **E**ncephalopathy / **E**arliest sign (Facial Pallor)

### **5. Diagnosis**
Diagnosis is based on history of exposure, clinical features, and laboratory tests.

| **Laboratory Parameter** | **Significance/Threshold** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Coproporphyrin in Urine (CPU)]]** | **Useful Screening Test.** Levels >150 $\mu$g/liter indicate exposure. |
| **[[Amino Levulinic Acid in Urine (ALAU)]]** | Levels >5 mg/liter indicate lead absorption. |
| **Lead in Blood** | Quantitative indicator. Levels **>70 $\mu$g/100 ml** are generally associated with clinical symptoms. |
| **Lead in Urine** | Levels >0.8 mg/liter indicate exposure. |
| **Basophilic Stippling** | Punctate basophilia in RBCs. Sensitive parameter of hematological response. |

### **6. Management and Treatment**
1.  **Immediate Removal:** Remove the worker from the source of exposure.
2.  **Decontamination:** Saline purge to remove unabsorbed lead from the gut.
3.  **Chelation Therapy:**
    *   **[[Calcium Disodium EDTA]] (Ca-EDTA):** Promotes lead excretion in urine.
    *   **[[D-penicillamine]]:** Effective oral chelating agent.
    *   **BAL (Dimercaprol):** Used in severe cases or encephalopathy.
4.  **Symptomatic:** Treatment for colic and anemia.

### **7. Prevention and Control**
Prevention follows the principles of occupational hygiene.

**A. Medical Measures**
*   **Pre-placement Examination:** To screen out susceptible individuals (e.g., those with anemia).
*   **Periodic Examination:** Regular checks for blue line, pallor, and lab tests (urine/blood lead).
*   **Notification:** Lead poisoning is a **notifiable disease** in India under the Factories Act.

**B. Engineering Measures**
*   **Substitution:** Replace lead with less toxic materials (e.g., Zinc or Iron paints instead of Lead paints).
*   **Isolation:** Segregate processes that generate lead dust.
*   **Local Exhaust Ventilation (LEV):** To remove fumes/dust at the source. Lead concentration in air should be kept below **2.0 mg per 10 cubic meters**.

**C. Personal Hygiene**
*   **Hand Washing:** Essential before eating (especially for painters/printers) to prevent ingestion.
*   **Prohibition of Eating at Workplace:** Strict enforcement.
*   **PPE:** Use of respirators and protective clothing.
