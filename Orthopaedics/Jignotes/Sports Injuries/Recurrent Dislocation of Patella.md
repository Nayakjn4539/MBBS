# [[Sports Injuries]] > Recurrent Dislocation of Patella

### Recurrent Dislocation of Patella

Recurrent dislocation of the patella is a condition where the [[patella]] (kneecap) dislocates repeatedly, almost always to the lateral side, often after minimal stress or trivial trauma. This condition is distinct from [[habitual dislocation]], where the patella dislocates every time the knee is flexed.

It commonly affects young adults, particularly adolescents, and is frequently bilateral.

### Etiology and Predisposing Factors
While the first episode may be traumatic, recurrent dislocation is strongly associated with underlying anatomical abnormalities that predispose the joint to instability.

**The Malicious Malalignment Syndrome**
This term describes a combination of factors that disturb the normal extensor mechanism:
1.  Excessive femoral anteversion.
2.  External [[tibial torsion]].
3.  [[Genu valgum]] (Knock knees).
4.  Increased [[Q-angle]].

#### Classification of Predisposing Factors
| Category | Specific Abnormalities | Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bony Factors** | Hypoplasia of the [[lateral femoral condyle]] | The bony buttress preventing lateral slip is shallow or absent. |
| | Shallow [[intercondylar groove]] | Reduces the containment of the patella. |
| **Patellar Factors** | [[Patella Alta]] | High-riding patella lies above the stabilizing trochlear groove in early flexion. |
| | Small patella | Less surface area for stabilization. |
| **Soft Tissue Factors**| Generalized ligamentous laxity | Often associated with Ehlers-Danlos or Marfan's syndrome. |
| | Weak [[vastus medialis obliquus]] (VMO) | Loss of dynamic medial pull. |
| | Tight [[lateral retinaculum]] | Tethers the patella laterally. |
| | Ruptured [[medial patellofemoral ligament]] (MPFL) | Loss of the primary static restraint against lateral displacement. |

### Mechanism of Injury
*   **Acute Episode:** Usually caused by a twisting force with the knee bent and the foot fixed (valgus-external rotation stress).
*   **Recurrent Episodes:** Occur with minimal stress, such as pivoting during sports or dancing. The [[quadriceps]] contracts while the knee is in valgus and slight flexion, pulling the patella laterally over the condyle.

### Clinical Features
**Symptoms**
*   **Giving way:** The patient may complain of the knee suddenly "giving way" or collapsing.
*   **Pain:** Anterior knee pain, especially after activity.
*   **Popping sensation:** Patient feels the bone popping out and may manually push it back (if not spontaneously reduced).
*   **Apprehension:** Fear of certain movements that mimic the mechanism of dislocation.

**Signs**
*   **Inspection:** The knee may look normal between attacks. If dislocated, the knee appears broad and flattened, with a prominence on the lateral side.
*   **Palpation:** Tenderness over the medial side (site of torn medial capsule/MPFL).
*   **Muscle Wasting:** Atrophy of the [[quadriceps]], specifically the [[vastus medialis]].

**Special Tests**
*   **[[Apprehension Test]] (Fairbank’s Test):** With the patient supine and quadriceps relaxed, the examiner gently pushes the patella laterally while flexing the knee. The test is **positive** if the patient resists, grabs the examiner's hand, or looks terrified (apprehensive) fearing dislocation.
*   **Q-Angle Assessment:** An angle greater than 20 degrees predisposes to lateral tracking.

### Diagnostic Imaging
**1. X-rays**
*   **Views:** Anteroposterior (AP), Lateral, and Skyline (Merchant/Sunrise) views.
*   **Findings:**
    *   **Lateral View:** Assess for [[Patella Alta]].
    *   **Skyline View:** Shows the position of the patella relative to the femoral groove (subluxation/tilt) and the depth of the groove (trochlear dysplasia).
    *   **Osteochondral fractures:** Look for loose bodies detached during dislocation.

**2. Radiographic Indices**
*   **[[Insall-Salvati Index]]:** Ratio of Patellar Tendon Length (TL) to Patellar Length (PL).
    *   Normal: 0.8 – 1.2
    *   > 1.2 indicates **Patella Alta** (High riding).
    *   < 0.8 indicates **Patella Baja** (Low riding).
*   **Blumensaat’s Line:** On a lateral X-ray with the knee flexed 30 degrees, the lower pole of the patella should lie on this line (roof of the intercondylar notch). If higher, it suggests patella alta.

**3. MRI**
*   Used to assess the integrity of the [[medial patellofemoral ligament]] (MPFL), articular cartilage damage, and occult osteochondral fractures.

### Management

#### Conservative Treatment
The first line of management, especially after the initial dislocation or in patients with infrequent episodes.
*   **Reduction:** If the patella is dislocated, extend the knee and gently push the patella medially.
*   **Immobilization:** A cylinder cast or brace for 2–3 weeks to allow soft tissue healing.
*   **Physical Therapy:**
    *   **Isometric Quadriceps Exercises:** Essential to prevent wasting.
    *   **VMO Strengthening:** Strengthening the [[vastus medialis obliquus]] is the cornerstone of rehabilitation to counteract lateral pull.
*   **Activity Modification:** Avoid provocative sports temporarily.

#### Operative Treatment
Indicated for recurrent dislocations affecting daily life, failure of conservative therapy, or presence of osteochondral loose bodies.

**Types of Surgeries:**
Current trends emphasize correcting the specific anatomical defect identified (arthroscopic assisted).

1.  **Soft Tissue Procedures:**
    *   **[[Lateral Retinacular Release]]:** Cutting the tight lateral retinaculum to reduce lateral pull (often done arthroscopically).
    *   **Medial Reefing/Plication:** Tightening the lax medial capsule and VMO.
    *   **[[MPFL Reconstruction]]:** Reconstructing the medial patellofemoral ligament using a graft (e.g., gracilis or semitendinosus) is the modern gold standard for restoring stability.

2.  **Bony Procedures (Realignment):**
    *   **[[Hauser’s Operation]]:** Transplantation of the tibial tuberosity (with patellar tendon insertion) **medially and distally**. This corrects the Q-angle and patella alta.
    *   **Goldthwait’s Operation:** The lateral half of the patellar tendon is detached and passed behind the medial half to be reattached to the tibia (acts as a checkrein).
    *   **Elmslie-Trillat Procedure:** Medialization of the tibial tubercle.
    *   **Maquet Procedure:** Anterior elevation of the tibial tubercle (mostly for chondromalacia/arthritis to offload the joint).

**Mnemonics for Surgical Goals:**
**"Realign the tracks"**
*   **R**elease lateral (Lateral release)
*   **R**eef medial (Medial plication)
*   **R**ealign tubercle (Hauser’s/Elmslie-Trillat)

### Complications
*   **[[Chondromalacia Patellae]]:** Damage to the articular cartilage of the patella due to abnormal tracking.
*   **Osteoarthritis:** Secondary patellofemoral arthritis in the long term.
*   **Recurrence:** If the underlying anatomical cause is not addressed.
*   **Loose Bodies:** Osteochondral fragments causing locking.
