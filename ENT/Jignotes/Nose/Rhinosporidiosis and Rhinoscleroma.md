# Rhinosporidiosis

### Overview & Etiology
Rhinosporidiosis is a chronic granulomatous disease affecting the mucous membranes.
*   **Causative Organism:** [[Rhinosporidium seeberi]].
    *   Taxonomy: Previously considered a fungus, genetic studies now classify it as an **aquatic protistan parasite** belonging to the class **Mesomycetozoea** (located phylogenetically between fungi and animals),,.
*   **Epidemiology:**
    *   Endemic in **South India** (specifically Tamil Nadu, Kerala), Sri Lanka, and parts of Africa,,.
    *   Affects males more than females (Age 15–40 years).
*   **Mode of Transmission:**
    *   Contact with stagnant water or contaminated soil (e.g., bathing in **ponds frequented by animals/cattle**),,.
    *   **Transepithelial infection:** Spores enter through traumatized epithelium (e.g., after nose picking),.

### Clinical Features
The disease primarily affects the **nose** and **nasopharynx**, but can also involve the lip, palate, [[conjunctiva]] (Ocular rhinosporidiosis), larynx, trachea, skin, and genitalia,.

**Nasal Presentation:**
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Unilateral [[nasal obstruction]].
    *   **Epistaxis** (frank or blood-tinged nasal discharge),.
    *   Pruritus/foreign body sensation.
*   **Signs (Anterior Rhinoscopy):**
    *   **Appearance:** Leafy, polypoidal, pedunculated or sessile mass,.
    *   **Color:** Pink to purple/red vascular mass.
    *   **Characteristic Sign:** Surface is studded with **white dots** (representing mature [[sporangia]]) giving it a **"Strawberry"** or **"Mulberry"** appearance,,,.
    *   **Consistency:** Friable, soft, and bleeds easily on touch,.

### Diagnosis & Investigations
*   **Biopsy/Histopathology (Gold Standard):**
    *   Shows large, thick-walled **sporangia** (100–300 microns) in various stages of maturation,.
    *   Sporangia contain thousands of **endospores** (spores),.
    *   Surrounding stroma shows chronic inflammatory cells (lymphocytes, plasma cells, giant cells).
    *   Stains used: **H&E** (shows spores), **PAS** (stains wall), **Mucicarmine**.
*   **Nasal Smear:** May show spores.
*   **Radiology (CT Scan):** To assess the extent of the disease and origin (usually distinct from [[nasal polyps]]).

### Treatment
*   **Surgical (Mainstay):**
    *   **Wide surgical excision** with **electrocautery** of the base of the lesion,.
    *   Cauterization is crucial to prevent recurrence from the base.
    *   Endoscopic removal is preferred for visualization.
*   **Medical (Adjuvant):**
    *   **[[Dapsone]]:** Used to prevent recurrence. It arrests sporangia maturation and promotes stromal fibrosis,,.
    *   Recurrence is common.

# Rhinoscleroma (Scleroma)

### Overview & Etiology
Rhinoscleroma is a chronic, progressive, granulomatous infectious disease involving the upper respiratory tract.
*   **Causative Organism:** **[[Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis]]** (also known as **Frisch bacillus**),,.
    *   It is a Gram-negative, encapsulated coccobacillus,.
*   **Epidemiology:**
    *   Endemic in **North India**, Central/South America, Egypt, and Eastern Europe,,.
    *   Associated with poor socioeconomic conditions and poor hygiene,.
*   **Sites Involved:** Primarily the **nose** (starts in the vestibule), but can extend to the nasopharynx, oropharynx, larynx (specifically **subglottis**), trachea, and bronchi,,. This extensive involvement is termed *Scleroma respiratorium*.

### Clinical Stages
The disease typically progresses through three stages,,:

| Stage | Clinical Features |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Atrophic (Catarrhal) Stage** | • Resembles [[atrophic rhinitis]].<br>• Foul-smelling purulent [[nasal discharge]] (rhinorrhea).<br>• Crusting.<br>• Most infective stage. |
| **2. Granulomatous (Hypertrophic) Stage** | • Formation of non-ulcerative, painless granulomatous nodules.<br>• **"Woody Nose"** or **"Hebra Nose"**: Subdermal infiltration of the lower external nose and upper lip gives a characteristic stony hard/woody feel,,.<br>• Nasal obstruction and epistaxis. |
| **3. Cicatricial (Fibrotic) Stage** | • Extensive fibrosis and scarring leading to stenosis.<br>• **"Tapir Nose"** deformity.<br>• **Subglottic stenosis** leading to respiratory distress/stridor,,. |

### Diagnosis & Histopathology
*   **Biopsy (Diagnostic):**
    *   **[[Mikulicz cells]]:** Large, vacuolated, foamy histiocytes (macrophages) containing the causative bacilli,,,. This is the hallmark of the disease.
    *   **[[Russell bodies]]:** Eosinophilic inclusion bodies found within plasma cells (accumulation of immunoglobulins),,.
    *   Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia may be seen.
*   **Culture:** Positive in only 50–60% of cases. Use MacConkey agar.

### Treatment
*   **Medical (Primary Treatment):** Long-term antibiotics are required (minimum 4–6 weeks or until cultures are negative),.
    *   **Drug of Choice:** **[[Tetracycline]]** + **[[Streptomycin]]**.
    *   Alternatives: **[[Rifampicin]]**, **[[Ciprofloxacin]]** (commonly used now),.
*   **Surgical:**
    *   Limited to correcting deformities or establishing an airway.
    *   Reconstructive surgery for nasal stenosis.
    *   Dilatation or surgical correction for subglottic stenosis,.

| Feature | **[[Rhinosporidiosis]]** | **[[Rhinoscleroma]]** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Organism** | *Rhinosporidium seeberi* (Protozoa) | *Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis* (Bacteria) |
| **Geography (India)** | South India (Tamil Nadu/Kerala) | North India (UP/Rajasthan) |
| **Clinical Look** | **Strawberry/Mulberry** polyp with **white dots** | **Woody/Hard nose** (Hebra nose) |
| **Nature** | Friable, bleeds on touch | Hard, non-ulcerative nodules |
| **Key Histopathology** | **Sporangia** with endospores | **Mikulicz cells** & **Russell bodies** |
| **Primary Treatment** | **Surgery** (Excision + Cautery) | **Medical** (Antibiotics: Tetracycline/Ciprofloxacin) |
| **Adjunct** | Dapsone | Steroids (to reduce fibrosis) |
