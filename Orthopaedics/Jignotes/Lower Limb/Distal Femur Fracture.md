# [[Lower Limb]] > Distal Femur Fracture

# Distal Femur Fracture

### Introduction and Anatomy
Fractures of the [[Distal Femur]] encompass injuries occurring in the lower one-third of the femur. This region extends approximately 7.6 cm to 15 cm proximally from the articular surface. The supracondylar area acts as a transition zone between the distal diaphysis and the femoral articular surface.

*   **Muscle Forces and Displacement:** The distal femur is subjected to significant deforming muscle forces:
    *   **Anteriorly:** The [[Quadriceps]] muscle exerts force.
    *   **Posteriorly:** The [[Gastrocnemius]] muscle flexes the distal fragment.
    *   **Result:** In [[Supracondylar Fracture]], the distal fragment is typically tilted **backwards (posteriorly)** due to the pull of the gastrocnemius, while the proximal fragment is pulled medially by adductors.

### Mechanism of Injury
*   **High Energy Trauma:** Common in young adults (e.g., motor vehicle accidents, motorcycle accidents). Often associated with severe soft tissue damage and multiple injuries.
*   **Low Energy Trauma:** Common in elderly osteoporotic patients (e.g., simple fall). The metaphyseal area is brittle in old age, making it susceptible to fracture from trivial trauma.

### Classification Systems

#### 1. Müller’s AO / OTA Classification
This is a widely accepted alphanumeric classification system based on the fracture pattern.

| Type | Description | Subtypes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type A** | **Extra-articular** | • Simple <br>• Metaphyseal wedge <br>• Metaphyseal comminution |
| **Type B** | **Partial Articular ([[Unicondylar Fracture]])** | • Lateral condyle <br>• Medial condyle <br>• Frontal fracture (Hoffa) |
| **Type C** | **Total Articular ([[Bicondylar Fracture]])** | • Articular & metaphyseal simple (T or Y pattern) <br>• Articular simple & metaphyseal comminution <br>• Total comminution |

#### 2. Neer’s Classification
Based on the displacement of the distal fragment:
*   **Type I:** Undisplaced.
*   **Type II:** Medial displacement.
*   **Type III:** Lateral displacement.
*   **Type IV:** Comminuted.

### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:** Severe pain, inability to bear weight, and inability to move the knee.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Swelling:** The knee is swollen; diffuse tenderness is present.
    *   **Deformity:** A flexion deformity is specific to this fracture (due to gastrocnemius pull).
    *   **[[Hemarthrosis]]:** Present if the fracture extends into the joint (doughy feel).
    *   **Abnormal Mobility & Crepitus:** Can be elicited (but should be done gently).
    *   **Neurovascular Status:** The [[Popliteal Artery]] is at risk due to the proximity of the distal fragment.

### Investigations
1.  **X-rays:** Standard Antero-posterior (AP) and Lateral views. Oblique views (45°) may be needed.
    *   *Findings:* Transverse or comminuted fracture; distal fragment often tilted backwards.
    *   **Important:** Include the entire femur to rule out proximal fractures or hip dislocation.
2.  **Computed Tomography ([[CT Scan]]):** Often needed to show the true extent of articular involvement and comminution (3D reconstruction is helpful).
3.  **[[Arteriography]]:** Performed if there is suspected vascular damage (e.g., absent distal pulses) or associated knee dislocation.

### Management

The management is challenging due to frequent comminution, proximity to the knee joint, and strong muscle forces.

#### 1. Conservative Management
*   **Indications:**
    *   Undisplaced or impacted fractures.
    *   Patients medically unfit for surgery.
    *   Young patients with no multiple injuries (rarely).
*   **Methods:**
    *   **Skeletal Traction:** Usually through the proximal tibia. The limb is supported on a [[Thomas Splint]] with a knee flexion piece (Pearson attachment) or a [[Bohler-Braun Splint]].
    *   **Cast-Brace:** Applied at 4–6 weeks when the fracture becomes "sticky" (beginning to unite). Allows knee mobilization.

#### 2. Operative Management
Operative fixation is generally the **treatment of choice** for displaced fractures to achieve anatomical reduction and early mobilization.

**A. Principles of Fixation:**
*   Anatomical reduction of the articular surface.
*   Rigid internal fixation.
*   Bone grafting if there is metaphyseal comminution/bone loss.

**B. Implant Options:**

| Implant Type | Description & Indications |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Dynamic Condylar Screw]] (DCS)** | Often used; provides strong fixation in the condyles. |
| **Condylar Blade Plate** | A fixed-angle device requiring precise insertion (95° condylar blade plate). |
| **Buttress Plate** | Used primarily for unicondylar fractures to support the condyle preventing collapse. |
| **Intramedullary Nails** | **Retrograde Nailing:** Inserted through the intercondylar notch. Useful for extra-articular or simple intra-articular fractures. <br> **Supracondylar Nail:** Specialized nails for distal fractures. |
| **[[LISS]]** | **Less Invasive Stabilization System:** An internal fixator technique useful for comminuted fractures. |
| **External Fixation** | Indicated for severe open fractures with extensive soft tissue damage or vascular injury. |

### Complications

#### Early
1.  **Vascular Injury:** Damage to the [[Popliteal Artery]] by the posterior displacement of the distal fragment. This is a surgical emergency.
2.  **Nerve Injury:** Damage to the tibial or common peroneal nerve (less common).
3.  **[[Fat Embolism]]:** Can occur, similar to shaft fractures.

#### Late
1.  **Knee Stiffness:** Very common due to intra-articular adhesions, quadriceps scarring, or prolonged immobilization.
2.  **[[Malunion]]:**
    *   Varus/Valgus deformity.
    *   Recurvatum (hyperextension) or flexion deformity.
3.  **Non-union:** Can occur, though less common than in the shaft.
4.  **Secondary [[Osteoarthritis]]:** Likely if the articular surface is not perfectly reduced.

### Clinical Implications
> **Clinical Pearl:** Always check the distal pulses (dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial) in distal femur fractures. The popliteal artery is tethered at the adductor hiatus and is vulnerable to injury from the spiked proximal end or the posteriorly displaced distal fragment.

> **Why are these fractures difficult?**
> 1. Frequently comminuted.
> 2. Distractive muscle forces (Gastrocnemius).
> 3. Intra-articular involvement.
> 4. Often occur in elderly with osteoporotic bone (poor screw hold).
