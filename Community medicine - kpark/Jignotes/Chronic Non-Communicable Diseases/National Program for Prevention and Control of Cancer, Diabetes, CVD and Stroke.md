# [[Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases]] > National Program for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, CVD and Stroke

### National Program for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, CVD and Stroke (NPCDCS)

**Current Status:** Renamed as **National Programme for Prevention & Control of Non-Communicable Diseases ([[NP-NCD]])** to include prevention of **COPD, CKD, Rheumatic fever, and NAFLD** (Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease).

### 1. Introduction and Rationale
India is experiencing a rapid health transition with a rising burden of [[Non-Communicable Diseases]] (NCDs). In 2016, NCDs accounted for **60% of deaths**. To address this, the NPCDCS was launched by integrating the National Cancer Control Programme with the program for Diabetes, CVD, and Stroke.

### 2. Objectives
The major objectives of the program are:
1.  **Prevent and control** common NCDs through behavior and lifestyle changes.
2.  **Early diagnosis and management** of common NCDs.
3.  **Capacity building** at various levels of health care (prevention, diagnosis, treatment).
4.  **Train human resources** (doctors, paramedics, nursing staff).
5.  **Establish palliative and rehabilitative care** capabilities.

### 3. Core Strategies
The program operates through the existing public health infrastructure:
*   **Health Promotion:** Massive education campaigns regarding lifestyle (Diet, Physical Activity, Tobacco/Alcohol avoidance, Stress management).
*   **Opportunistic Screening:** Screening persons **above 30 years** and pregnant women of all ages.
*   **Strengthening Infrastructure:** Establishing NCD clinics at CHC and District levels.

### 4. Institutional Framework and Service Delivery

| Level of Care | Activities and Services | Staffing/Support |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sub-Centre (SC)** | • **Opportunistic Screening:** BP measurement and Blood Glucose (Strip method) for age >30 yrs.<br>• **Referral:** Suspected cases referred to CHC/PHC.<br>• **Health Promotion:** Lifestyle changes. | • [[ANM]]/ASHA<br>• Equipped with Glucometer, strips, lancets, BP apparatus. |
| **PHC** | • **Diagnosis:** Confirmation of referred cases.<br>• **Management:** Initiation of treatment.<br>• **Drug Supply:** At least 1 month supply given; subsequent supplies can be stocked at SC. | • Medical Officer<br>• Integration with [[AYUSH]] for holistic care. |
| **Community Health Centre (CHC)** | • **NCD Clinic:** Diagnosis via Lab/ECG/X-ray.<br>• **Management:** Stabilization of common CVD, Diabetes, Stroke.<br>• **Home Visits:** Nurses undertake visits for bedridden cases. | • Medical Specialists (Physician)<br>• Nurses<br>• Referral to District Hospital for complications. |
| **District Hospital (DH)** | • **NCD Clinic:** Comprehensive screening and management.<br>• **Cancer Care:** Day care chemotherapy, common diagnostics, basic surgery.<br>• **Palliative Care:** Home-based palliative care for chronic/debilitating patients. | • Detailed investigation facilities (Mammography, etc.)<br>• Chemotherapy drugs provision. |

### 5. Cancer Component Strategies
Integration with NPCDCS allows for better resource utilization:
*   **Regional Cancer Centres (RCC):** Act as referral centers for complicated cases and research.
*   **Tertiary Cancer Centres (TCCs):** Scheme to strengthen 45 centers to provide comprehensive care.
*   **Oncology Wings:** Development of oncology wings in Government Medical College Hospitals.
*   **Decentralized NGO Scheme:** Financial assistance to NGOs for IEC activities and early detection.

### 6. Newer Initiatives and Integration
*   **Integration with RNTCP (NTEP):** [[Bidirectional screening]] strategy for **TB and Diabetes comorbidities**. TB patients are screened for Diabetes and vice versa.
*   **Integration with RBSK:** Intervention for prevention/control of **Rheumatic Heart Disease**.
*   **Integration with AYUSH:** Promoting healthy lifestyles through Yoga and Naturopathy.
*   **Expansion:** Inclusion of **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)** and **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** prevention.

### 7. Targets (NCD Global Monitoring Framework)
India has adopted voluntary targets to be achieved by **2025**:

*   **Mortality:** **25%** relative reduction in premature mortality from CVD, Cancer, Diabetes, or Chronic Respiratory Diseases.
*   **BP:** **25%** relative reduction in prevalence of raised [[Blood Pressure]].
*   **Tobacco:** **30%** relative reduction in prevalence of current tobacco use.
*   **Salt:** **30%** relative reduction in mean intake (Target: <5g/day).
*   **Physical Inactivity:** **10%** relative reduction.
*   **Alcohol:** **10%** relative reduction in harmful use.
*   **Obesity/Diabetes:** Halt the rise.
*   **Drug Therapy:** **50%** of eligible people receive drug therapy/counseling.
*   **Medicines:** **80%** availability of affordable basic technologies and essential medicines.

### 8. Clinical Relevance: Opportunistic Screening
*   **Definition:** Screening individuals who visit health facilities for *other* ailments (e.g., a patient comes for fever but is screened for HTN/Diabetes).
*   **Criteria:** Any individual **>30 years** of age.
*   **Method:**
    *   **Diabetes:** Random Blood Sugar (RBS) > 140 mg/dl refers to MO for confirmation.
    *   **Hypertension:** Systolic >140 or Diastolic >90 mmHg refers to MO.
    *   **Cervical Cancer:** [[Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid]] (VIA).
    *   **Breast Cancer:** Clinical Breast Examination (CBE).
    *   **Oral Cancer:** Oral visual examination for white/red patches.
