# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > MDT for Leprosy

# [[Multi-Drug Therapy (MDT)]] for Leprosy

MDT is the standard treatment strategy recommended by the **WHO** and implemented under the **[[National Leprosy Eradication Programme]] (NLEP)**. It involves the use of a combination of drugs to treat leprosy, primarily to combat resistance against single-drug therapy (Dapsone monotherapy).

### 🎯 Objectives of MDT
1.  **Interrupt Transmission:** Renders infectious cases non-infectious rapidly,.
2.  **Prevent Drug Resistance:** Using multiple drugs prevents the emergence of resistant strains of *[[Mycobacterium leprae]]*,.
3.  **Cure & Prevent Disability:** Ensures early cure and reduces the risk of deformities,.

### 📋 Operational Classification for Treatment
Before starting MDT, patients are classified based on the number of skin lesions and nerve involvement,,,:

| Type | **[[Paucibacillary]] (PB)** | **[[Multibacillary]] (MB)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Skin Lesions** | 1 to 5 lesions | 6 or more lesions |
| **Nerve Involvement** | No nerve / Only 1 nerve | More than 1 nerve |
| **Skin Smear** | Negative at all sites | Positive at any site |

### ⚠️ Pharmacology & Side Effects
The "Big Three" drugs in MDT have distinct characteristics and side effects-,:

**1. [[Rifampicin]] (Bactericidal)**
*   *Action:* Highly bactericidal; kills 99.9% of bacilli.
*   *Side Effects:* **Hepatotoxicity**, flu-like syndrome, thrombocytopenia.
*   *Patient Advice:* Warn the patient that **urine/sweat will turn orange/red** (harmless).

**2. [[Dapsone]] (Bacteriostatic)**
*   *Action:* Weak bactericidal/bacteriostatic.
*   *Side Effects:* **Hemolytic anemia** (check Hb before starting), Methaemoglobinaemia, Exfoliative dermatitis, **Dapsone Syndrome** (fever, rash, lymphadenopathy).
*   *Caution:* Avoid in Sulpha allergy.

**3. [[Clofazimine]] (Bacteriostatic + Anti-inflammatory)**
*   *Action:* Weak anti-leprosy effect but suppresses **[[Lepra Reactions]]**.
*   *Side Effects:* **Reddish-black skin discoloration** (reversible), ichthyosis (dry scaling skin), GI upset.

**💡 Mnemonic for Side Effects:**
*   **R**ifampicin $\rightarrow$ **R**ed Urine
*   **D**apsone $\rightarrow$ **D**ecreased Hb (Anemia)
*   **C**lofazimine $\rightarrow$ **C**olored Skin

### 🏥 Surveillance (Follow-up)
After completion of treatment, patients are monitored for relapse,,:
*   **Paucibacillary (PB):** Yearly clinical exam for **2 years**.
*   **Multibacillary (MB):** Yearly clinical exam for **5 years**.

### 🌟 Clinical Relevance
*   **Pregnancy:** MDT is considered **safe** during pregnancy and lactation. Treatment should be continued as leprosy exacerbates during pregnancy.
*   **Reactions:** If a patient develops a **[[Lepra Reaction]]** (Type 1 or ENL) during treatment, **DO NOT STOP MDT**. Manage the reaction with steroids (Prednisolone) or analgesics while continuing leprosy treatment.
*   **Defaulter:** A patient who has not collected treatment for 12 consecutive months.
