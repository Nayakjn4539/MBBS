# [[Lower Limb]] > Tibia Shaft Fracture

### Tibia Shaft Fractures

#### Relevant Anatomy and Pathophysiology
The [[tibia]] is the major weight-bearing bone of the leg. It possesses unique anatomical characteristics that influence fracture patterns and healing:
*   **Subcutaneous Nature:** The anteromedial border (shin) and medial surface are subcutaneous. This predisposes the tibia to being the most common site for [[open fractures]].
*   **Blood Supply:** The nutrient artery arises from the [[posterior tibial artery]], enters the bone distal to the soleus origin, and runs distally. The distal third of the tibia has a precarious blood supply, making it prone to [[delayed union]] and [[non-union]].
*   **Compartments:** The leg has four tight fascial compartments (anterior, lateral, superficial posterior, deep posterior), making it a high-risk site for [[compartment syndrome]].

#### Mechanism of Injury
Fractures occur due to direct or indirect forces:
*   **Direct Injury:**
    *   **High Energy:** (e.g., motorcycle accidents, car bumpers). Often causes transverse, comminuted, or displaced fractures with significant soft tissue crushing/skin splitting (High-energy injuries).
    *   **Crush Injury:** Direct blow causing fracture and soft tissue damage.
*   **Indirect Injury:**
    *   **Twisting Force:** Causes spiral fractures of both leg bones at different levels.
    *   **Angulatory Force:** Produces short oblique fractures, often with a "butterfly" fragment.
    *   **Low Energy:** Skiing injuries or falls.

#### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:** Pain, inability to bear weight, swelling.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Deformity:** Angulation or rotation.
    *   **Soft Tissue:** Check for bruising, tenting of skin, or open wounds (compound fracture).
    *   **Neurovascular Status:** Assess pulses (dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial) and sensation. **Must** assess for signs of impending compartment syndrome.

**Clinical Implication:** Always examine the spine and pelvis in high-energy injuries, as associated injuries may be missed due to the distracting pain of the tibial fracture.

#### Imaging
*   **X-rays:** The "Rule of Twos" applies:
    *   Two views: Anteroposterior (AP) and Lateral.
    *   Two joints: Must include the [[knee]] and [[ankle]] to rule out associated injuries.
    *   Two occasions: Repeat if diagnosis is unclear.
    *   Two limbs: Compare with the normal side if necessary (especially in children).

#### Classification
Commonly described by descriptive terms or AO classification:
1.  **Open vs. Closed:** Based on skin integrity.
2.  **Morphology:** Transverse, Oblique, Spiral, Comminuted, Segmental.
3.  **Stability:**
    *   **Stable:** Transverse fractures (remain in place after reduction).
    *   **Unstable:** Spiral/Oblique/Comminuted (tend to slip/shorten).

#### Management
The goal is to obtain and hold alignment, preserve soft tissue, and start early weight-bearing.

**1. Conservative Management**
Indicated for stable, closed, low-energy fractures with minimal displacement.
*   **Cast Immobilization:** Initially a long-leg cast (above knee).
*   **Patellar Tendon Bearing (PTB) Cast:** Applied once swelling subsides (usually 3-4 weeks). It allows weight-bearing while preventing rotation/angulation. Moulded at the patellar tendon for weight transmission.
*   **Functional Bracing (Sarmiento):** Applied after the fracture becomes "sticky" (3-6 weeks). Allows joint movement and promotes union through micromotion.

**2. Operative Management**
Indicated for unstable fractures, open fractures, segmental fractures, floating knee, or compartment syndrome.

| Method | Description | Indications | Advantages |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Intramedullary Nailing]]** (Interlocking) | Gold standard for diaphyseal fractures. Nail inserted down the medullary canal. Proximal and distal locking screws prevent rotation and shortening. | Closed fractures, Grade I/II/IIIA open fractures, Segmental fractures. | Load-sharing, early mobilization, high union rates. |
| **[[Plating]] (ORIF/MIPO)** | Plate fixation on the lateral surface. Minimally Invasive Plate Osteosynthesis (MIPO) preserves soft tissue. | Metaphyseal extension, fractures where nailing is difficult. | Anatomical reduction. |
| **[[External Fixation]]** | Pins placed proximal and distal to fracture, connected by external rods. | Severe open fractures (Grade IIIB/C), rapid stabilization in damage control (polytrauma). | Minimal soft tissue stripping, quick application. |

**Clinical Implication:** [[Intramedullary nailing]] is generally preferred over plating for shaft fractures because plates are load-bearing (risk of fatigue failure) while nails are load-sharing.

#### Management of Open Fractures
Tibial fractures are the most common open long-bone fractures.
*   **Protocol:** Antibiotics, Tetanus prophylaxis, and urgent debridement.
*   **Debridement:** Thorough excision of dead tissue/muscle. "The solution to pollution is dilution" (copious irrigation).
*   **Stabilization:** External fixation or unreamed/reamed nailing depending on contamination level.
*   **Coverage:** Split skin grafts or flaps (muscle/fasciocutaneous) required for soft tissue defects.

#### Complications

**1. Compartment Syndrome**
*   **Incidence:** Tibial fractures are the *most common* cause of compartment syndrome.
*   **Diagnosis:** Clinical suspicion is key.
    *   **Early signs:** Pain out of proportion to injury, pain on **passive stretch** of toes.
    *   **Pressure:** Intracompartmental pressure > 30 mmHg (or within 30 mmHg of diastolic BP).
*   **Treatment:** Emergency [[Fasciotomy]] (decompression of all 4 compartments).

**2. Vascular Injury**
*   Fractures of the proximal half may damage the [[popliteal artery]] or its branches. This is a surgical emergency.

**3. Delayed Union and Non-Union**
*   **Causes:** Poor blood supply (distal 1/3rd), severe soft tissue damage, infection, inadequate stabilization.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   *Hypertrophic Non-union:* Needs stability (e.g., exchange nailing, plating).
    *   *Atrophic Non-union:* Needs biology (Bone grafting) + Stability.
    *   *Infected Non-union:* Ilizarov ring fixator (bone transport).

**4. Malunion**
*   Shortening or rotational deformity. May require corrective [[osteotomy]].

**5. Infection (Osteomyelitis)**
*   High risk in open fractures. May lead to chronic discharging sinuses and sequestrum formation.

#### Mnemonics
**5 P's of Compartment Syndrome:**
1.  **P**ain (out of proportion/on passive stretch) - *Earliest sign*
2.  **P**aresthesia
3.  **P**allor
4.  **P**aralysis (Late)
5.  **P**ulselessness (Very Late - do not wait for this!)

**Blood Supply of Tibia:**
"From the knee I flee" — The nutrient artery enters proximally and runs distally; hence the distal third is the watershed area prone to non-union.
