# [[Medical Law And Ethics]] > Torture and Human Rights

### Torture and Human Rights (Istanbul Protocol)

**Torture** is defined as the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering (physical or mental) on a person for purposes such as obtaining information, confession, punishment, intimidation, or coercion, usually by a public official or with their consent/acquiescence.

### The Istanbul Protocol
The **[[Istanbul Protocol]]** (1999) is the "Manual on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment". It was adopted by the United Nations.

**Key Objectives:**
1.  **International Standard:** It serves as the global guideline for assessing persons who allege torture and ill-treatment.
2.  **Documentation:** It outlines how to effectively document medical, psychological, and legal evidence.
3.  **Investigation:** It guides the investigation of alleged torture cases to ensure accountability.

**Components of the Protocol:**
*   **Legal Standards:** Overview of international law regarding torture.
*   **Ethical Codes:** Relevant codes for lawyers and health professionals.
*   **Legal Investigation:** Procedures for gathering evidence and witness statements.
*   **Physical Evidence:** Guidelines for medical examination.
*   **Psychological Evidence:** Guidelines for psychological evaluation.

### Medical Ethics and Declarations
Doctors play a crucial role in protecting human rights. Several international declarations govern the physician's conduct regarding torture:

1.  **[[Declaration of Tokyo]] (WMA, 1975):**
    *   **Core Principle:** Doctors shall **not** countenance, condone, or participate in the practice of torture.
    *   Doctors must not provide premises, instruments, substances, or knowledge to facilitate torture.
    *   Doctors should not be present during any procedure where torture is used or threatened.
    *   **Artificial Feeding:** Doctors should not artificially feed a prisoner who refuses nourishment and is capable of forming a rational judgment (hunger strike), provided the refusal is voluntary.

2.  **[[Declaration of Geneva]]:**
    *   Physicians pledge: "I will not use my medical knowledge to violate human rights and civil liberties, even under threat."

3.  **UN Principles of Medical Ethics (1982):**
    *   It is a contravention of medical ethics for health personnel to engage in any professional relationship with prisoners/detainees mainly to evaluate their ability to sustain torture.

### Classification of Torture Methods
Torture is generally classified into physical, psychological, and pharmacological types.

#### 1. Physical Torture
Methods designed to cause pain without necessarily leaving permanent visible marks.

| Method | Description | Finding/Sequelae |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Beating** | Fists, feet, truncheons, whips. | Bruises (patterned), fractures, internal injury, renal failure (myoglobinuria). |
| **[[Falanga]]** (Bastinado) | Beating on the soles of the feet. | Aseptic necrosis of bones, plantar aponeuritis, difficulty walking, closed compartment syndrome. |
| **Suspension** | **Palestinian Hanging:** Suspended with arms tied behind back. <br> **Parrot's Perch (Jack):** Suspended by knees and wrists from a horizontal pole. | Brachial plexus injury, dislocation of shoulders, neuromuscular damage. |
| **[[Telefono]]** | Hard slapping or high-pressure air on ears. | Ruptured tympanic membrane, hearing loss. |
| **[[Submarino]]** | **Wet:** Forced immersion of head in water/urine/vomit. <br> **Dry:** Plastic bag over head (asphyxiation). | Hypoxia, aspiration pneumonia, petechiae, psychological trauma. |
| **Electric Shock** | Cattle prods or electrodes on sensitive areas (genitals, nipples, tongue). | **[[Picana]]**: Electrical burns (pitted, crater-like), Joule burns, cardiac arrhythmias. |
| **Positional Torture** | Forced standing/crouching for days. | Edema, venous thrombosis, exhaustion. |
| **Sexual Torture** | Rape, mutilation, forced sodomy. | Genital trauma, STDs, pregnancy, anal sphincter laxity. |

#### 2. Psychological Torture
Often leaves deeper scars than physical torture.
*   **Sensory Deprivation:** Solitary confinement, dark rooms, hoods/blindfolds.
*   **Sleep Deprivation:** Continuous noise, light, or forced movement.
*   **Humiliation:** Forced nudity, verbal abuse, being forced to eat excreta.
*   **Threats:** Mock executions, threats against family members.
*   **Phamacological:** Forced ingestion of hallucinogens or neuroleptics.

> **Mnemonic for Torture declarations:**
> **T**okyo = **T**orture (Don't participate).
> **H**elsinki = **H**uman experimentation (Ethics of research).
> **G**eneva = **G**eneral duties (Hippocratic oath modernization).

### Medicolegal Aspects and Examination
The medical examination must be thorough, unbiased, and documented meticulously.

**1. History Taking:**
*   Must be detailed. Record the allegations in the survivor's own words.
*   Note consistency between the history given and the injuries observed.

**2. Physical Examination:**
*   **Skin:** Look for scars, burns (cigarette burns), pattern bruises (tramline bruising from rods), electrical marks.
*   **Musculoskeletal:** Palpate for tenderness, fractures, or joint dislocations.
*   **Feet:** Look for signs of Falanga (erythema, swelling, tenderness of soles).
*   **[[Rape Trauma Syndrome]]:** Assess for psychological sequelae.

**3. Documentation:**
*   Use body diagrams/pictographs.
*   Photograph injuries with a scale and color reference.
*   Conclusion should state the degree of consistency between allegations and findings (e.g., "Highly Consistent", "Consistent", "Not Consistent").

### Custodial Deaths and Autopsy Findings
**[[Custodial Death]]** refers to death occurring while an individual is in the custody of law enforcement agencies (police/prison).

**National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) Guidelines (India):**
1.  **Panel Autopsy:** Autopsy must be conducted by a panel of at least **two** doctors (preferably qualified in Forensic Medicine).
2.  **Videography:** Complete video filming of the post-mortem examination is mandatory to prevent tampering and ensure transparency.
3.  **Model Autopsy Form:** Use of the specific NHRC autopsy proforma.
4.  **Reporting:** Report must be sent to the NHRC within 24 hours (initial intimation) and complete report subsequently.

**Autopsy Findings in Torture:**
*   **External:**
    *   Often **negative** or minimal in skilled torture (e.g., wet submarino, dry submarino, electrical shocks with wet cloth).
    *   Look for patterned abrasions, contusions (soles, palms, buttocks).
    *   **[[Scars]]**: Keloids, hyperpigmentation from old injuries.
    *   **Ligature marks:** Wrists or ankles (from suspension/hog-tying).
*   **Internal:**
    *   **Subcutaneous bruising:** Incise the skin of back, limbs, and soles (layer dissection) to reveal hidden hematomas (extravasation of blood).
    *   **Muscles:** Rhabdomyolysis (crush syndrome) leading to renal failure.
    *   **Brain:** Cerebral edema or hemorrhage if head trauma occurred.
*   **Homicide by Heart Attack:** Severe emotional and physical stress during torture can precipitate cardiac arrhythmias or infarction in a person with pre-existing (often asymptomatic) heart disease. This is legally considered homicide.
