# [[Special Injuries]] > Deaths from Cold

### Deaths from Cold (Hypothermia/Frostbite)

Injuries or death resulting from exposure to low environmental temperatures are classified under thermal injuries. These are broadly divided into **systemic effects** ([[hypothermia]]) and **localized effects** ([[frostbite]], [[trench foot]], [[immersion foot]]).

### I. General Considerations

*   **Definition of [[Hypothermia]]:** A condition where the core body temperature drops below **35°C (95°F)**.
*   **Mechanism:** Heat loss exceeds heat production. Death usually occurs due to circulatory failure (ventricular fibrillation) or respiratory failure.
*   **Measurement:** Ordinary clinical thermometers are insufficient. A **low-reading thermometer** (rectal or esophageal probe) is required.

#### Classification of Hypothermia

| Severity | Core Temperature | Clinical Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mild** | 35°C – 32°C | Shivering, tachycardia, hypertension, confusion. |
| **Moderate** | 32°C – 28°C | **Shivering stops**, bradycardia, hypotension, paradoxical undressing, hallucinations. |
| **Severe** | < 28°C | Coma, apnea, ventricular fibrillation, death. |

### II. Local Cold Injuries

Local injuries occur due to vasoconstriction, ice crystal formation, and endothelial damage.

#### 1. [[Frostbite]]
*   **Cause:** Exposure to **dry cold** / freezing temperatures (below 0°C).
*   **Pathology:** Formation of **intracellular ice crystals**, causing cell dehydration and mechanical damage.
*   **Sites:** Peripheries (Tips of fingers, toes, nose, ear lobes).
*   **Grading:**
    *   **1st Degree:** Erythema, edema (Frost nip).
    *   **2nd Degree:** Blisters formation.
    *   **3rd Degree:** Necrosis of skin and subcutaneous tissue.
    *   **4th Degree:** Deep necrosis involving muscle and bone (Gangrene).

#### 2. [[Trench Foot]] and [[Immersion Foot]]
*   **Cause:** Prolonged exposure to **wet cold** (non-freezing temperatures) combined with immobility/constriction.
*   **Mechanism:** Damage to nerves and muscles due to ischemia.
*   **Clinical:** Pale, pulseless, anesthetic feet; later become hyperemic and painful on warming.

### III. Special Phenomena in Hypothermia

These behavioral changes often confuse investigators and mimic sexual assault or homicide.

#### 1. [[Paradoxical Undressing]]
*   **Definition:** Victims strip off their clothes despite the freezing cold.
*   **Mechanism:** Paralysis of the vasomotor center leads to failure of peripheral vasoconstriction. This causes a sudden rush of warm blood from the core to the skin, giving the victim a false sensation of "extreme heat" or "burning up".
*   **Medicolegal Pitfall:** The naked body may be mistaken for a victim of sexual assault.

#### 2. [[Hide and Die Syndrome]] (Terminal Burrowing)
*   **Definition:** In the final stages of hypothermia, the confused and delirious victim attempts to hide or burrow into small, enclosed spaces (e.g., under beds, behind wardrobes, in snowdrifts).
*   **Mechanism:** Primitive instinct to conserve heat or terminal brainstem hallucination.
*   **Medicolegal Pitfall:** The position of the body may suggest concealment of a homicide.

### IV. Autopsy Findings

The diagnosis of death from cold is largely one of exclusion and circumstantial evidence.

#### A. External Findings
1.  **[[Postmortem Lividity]]**: **Bright Pink** or **Cherry Red** color.
    *   *Reason:* At low temperatures, the dissociation of oxyhemoglobin is retarded (oxygen remains bound to hemoglobin). *Note: Must be differentiated from [[CO poisoning]] and [[cyanide poisoning]].*
2.  **Appearance**: The body appears pale and waxy.
3.  **Signs of Exposure**: Erythematous patches on the cheeks, knees, elbows, and nose.
4.  **Edema**: Generalized edema or local swelling of extremities.
5.  **Attitude**: Body is often found in a **flexed (fetal) position** to conserve heat.
6.  **Skin**: **Cutis Anserina** (Gooseflesh) may be present due to rigor of erector pilae muscles (nonspecific).

#### B. Internal Findings
1.  **[[Wischnewsky Spots]] (Leopard Spots):**
    *   **Appearance:** Multiple, small, blackish-brown, superficial erosions/hemorrhages on the **gastric mucosa** (stomach lining).
    *   **Significance:** Highly characteristic of fatal hypothermia but can also be seen in shock or stress.
    *   **Mechanism:** Micro-infarcts due to capillary rupture.
2.  **Pancreatitis**: Areas of fat necrosis in the pancreas and mesentery are seen in about 50% of cases.
3.  **Blood**: Oxygenated (bright red) and fluid. Ice crystals may be found in the heart or vessels.
4.  **Brain**: Perivascular hemorrhages; congestion.
5.  **Lungs**: Pulmonary edema, congestion, and bright red color.
6.  **Heart**: Sub-endocardial and sub-epicardial hemorrhages.

### V. Medicolegal Aspects

1.  **Accidental:** Most common. Seen in:
    *   Alcoholics/Drug addicts (vasodilation accelerates heat loss).
    *   Vagrants/Homeless people during winter.
    *   Mountaineers and trekkers.
    *   Elderly persons with poor thermoregulation.
    *   Newborns (large surface area to body weight ratio).
2.  **Homicidal:** Rare.
    *   Abandoning infants or incapacitated elderly in cold environments.
    *   Leaving an unconscious assault victim in the snow.
3.  **Suicidal:** Rare.
4.  **Differentiation:**
    *   *Pink Lividity:* Rule out [[Carbon Monoxide]] (CO) poisoning (CO-Hb) and [[Cyanide]] (Cyan-Hb) via chemical analysis.
    *   *Alcohol:* Blood alcohol analysis is crucial as it predisposes to hypothermia.

### Mnemonic

**"COLD"** for Autopsy Findings:
*   **C** - **C**olored Lividity (Pink/Cherry Red).
*   **O** - **O**edema (Pulmonary and generalized).
*   **L** - **L**eopard spots ([[Wischnewsky spots]] in stomach).
*   **D** - **D**istorted pancreas (Fat necrosis/Pancreatitis).
