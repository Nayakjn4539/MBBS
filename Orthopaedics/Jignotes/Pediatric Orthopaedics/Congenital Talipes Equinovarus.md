# Congenital Talipes Equinovarus (CTEV) - Clubfoot

[[Congenital Talipes Equinovarus]] (CTEV), commonly known as **Clubfoot**, is one of the most common and complex congenital deformities of the lower limb. It is characterized by a triad of deformities: the entire foot is inverted, the heel is drawn up, and the forefoot is adducted.

### Nomenclature and Definition
The term is derived from:
*   **Talipes:** Ankle and Foot (Talus = ankle; Pes = foot).
*   **Equinus:** The heel is elevated (like a horse's hoof), limiting dorsiflexion.
*   **Varus:** The foot is inverted and adducted.

### Epidemiology
*   **Incidence:** Approximately 1–2 per 1,000 live births.
*   **Gender:** Male to Female ratio is **2:1**.
*   **Laterality:** Bilateral in **50%** of cases. If unilateral, the right side is slightly more common.
*   **Genetics:** Polygenic inheritance; risk increases if a sibling or parent is affected (1:35 in siblings).

### Etiology and Classification
The exact cause is often unknown (idiopathic), but several theories exist.

#### Theories of Pathogenesis
1.  **Mechanical Theory:** Intrauterine compression (e.g., oligohydramnios) forces the foot into a deformed position.
2.  **Neuromuscular Defect:** Imbalance between contracting and relaxing muscle groups (e.g., weak peroneals vs. strong tibialis posterior).
3.  **Primary Germ Plasm Defect:** A defect in the [[Talus]] leads to subsequent soft tissue changes.
4.  **Vascular Theory:** Anomalies in the vascular supply (arterial dysgenesis) cause fibrosis.
5.  **Arrested Fetal Development:** The foot fails to move from the equinovarus position (normal in early fetal life) to the neutral position.

#### Clinical Classification
| Type | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Idiopathic (Primary)** | Most common. No other associated anomalies. Grade ranges from supple to rigid. |
| **Secondary (Teratologic)** | Associated with underlying disorders like [[Spina Bifida]], [[Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita]], or [[Meningomyelocele]]. These are usually more rigid and resistant to conservative treatment. |
| **Syndromic** | Associated with syndromes like [[Larsen's Syndrome]] or [[Diastrophic Dwarfism]]. |
| **Postural** | Positional deformity; foot is normal size and fully correctable passively. |

### Pathoanatomy
The primary pathology lies in the **Talus** (which is plantarflexed and deformed), but secondary changes affect all tissues.

#### Bony Changes
*   **Talus:** Neck is deviated medially and plantarflexed. The head is palpable on the dorsolateral aspect.
*   **Calcaneus:** Rotated into **varus**, equinus, and medial rotation.
*   **Navicular:** Displaced **medially** and articulates with the medial aspect of the talar head (instead of the anterior aspect).
*   **Cuboid:** Displaced medially.

#### Soft Tissue Contractures (The Tight Structures)
Structures on the **medial** and **posterior** aspects are shortened and fibrotic.

| Location | Contracted Structures |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Posterior** | [[Tendoachilles]], Posterior capsule of the ankle, Talocalcaneal capsule. |
| **Medial** | [[Tibialis Posterior]] (key deforming force), [[Flexor Digitorum Longus]], [[Flexor Hallucis Longus]], Deltoid ligament, Spring ligament, Talonavicular capsule. |
| **Plantar** | [[Plantar Fascia]], Abductor Hallucis. |

### Clinical Features
The diagnosis is essentially clinical. The deformity consists of four components, remembered by the mnemonic **CAVE**.

#### The Deformities (CAVE)
1.  **C**avus: Exaggeration of the longitudinal arch (due to plantar flexion of the forefoot on the hindfoot).
2.  **A**dduction: Forefoot adduction at the tarsometatarsal joints.
3.  **V**arus: Inversion of the heel (hindfoot varus).
4.  **E**quinus: Plantar flexion of the ankle.

#### Other Signs
*   **Size:** The foot is smaller and shorter than the normal side.
*   **Calf Wasting:** The calf muscles are atrophic/wasted (a persistent feature even after correction).
*   **Creases:** Deep skin creases are present on the medial and posterior aspects.
*   **Bony Prominence:** The head of the [[Talus]] can be felt on the dorsolateral aspect of the foot (this is the fulcrum for correction).
*   **Heel:** The heel is small and high ("empty heel").

### Clinical Tests
1.  **Dorsiflexion Test:** In a normal newborn, the foot can be dorsiflexed until the toe touches the shin. In CTEV, this is restricted.
2.  **Scratch Test:** Scratching the sole causes muscle contraction; helpful to assess muscle imbalance.
3.  **Plumbline Test:** To detect tibial torsion.

> **Clinical Implication:** Always examine the hips and spine to rule out [[Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip]] (DDH) and [[Spina Bifida]], which are commonly associated with clubfoot.

### Radiological Assessment
X-rays are difficult to interpret in newborns due to lack of ossification centers. They are useful for assessment during treatment or in older children.
*   **Views:** AP and Lateral (stress dorsiflexion view).
*   **Kite’s Angle (Talocalcaneal Angle):**
    *   **Normal:** 20°–40°. The long axis of the talus and calcaneus diverge.
    *   **Clubfoot:** <20° (Parallelism). The talus and calcaneus appear parallel to each other in both AP and Lateral views.

### Management
Treatment should begin as early as possible, ideally within the first week of life ("As soon as the mother is fit").

#### 1. Conservative Management: The Ponseti Method
This is the **Gold Standard** for treatment worldwide. It relies on serial manipulation and casting.

**Technique:**
*   **Weekly Casting:** Above-knee casts (to control tibial rotation) are changed weekly.
*   **Fulcrum:** The head of the [[Talus]] is used as the fulcrum for manipulation. **Never** touch the Calcaneus.
*   **Order of Correction (CAVE mnemonic):**
    1.  **C**avus is corrected first by supination of the forefoot (aligning the forefoot with the hindfoot).
    2.  **A**dduction and **V**arus are corrected simultaneously by abducting the foot around the talar head.
    3.  **E**quinus is corrected *last*.

**Percutaneous Tendoachilles Tenotomy:**
*   Correcting equinus by casting alone often fails or causes a "rocker-bottom" deformity.
*   A minor surgical cut (tenotomy) of the [[Tendoachilles]] is performed in ~90% of cases once Cavus, Adduction, and Varus are corrected, but ankle dorsiflexion remains <10 degrees.
*   A final cast is applied for 3 weeks after tenotomy.

#### 2. Maintenance Phase (Bracing)
To prevent recurrence (which is common due to the elastic nature of tissues), a brace is used after the final cast is removed.
*   **Device:** **Foot Abduction Orthosis** (e.g., [[Dennis Browne Splint]] or Steenbeek brace).
*   **Protocol:**
    *   **23 hours/day** for the first 3 months.
    *   **Night-time only** (while sleeping) until the age of 3–4 years.
*   **Shoes:** CTEV shoes (straight inner border, outer shoe raise, no heel) may be used for walking children.

#### 3. Surgical Management
Surgery is reserved for resistant cases, neglected cases, or severe relapses.

**A. Soft Tissue Procedures (Turco's Procedure)**
*   **Indication:** Children < 5 years (typically 6-12 months) who fail conservative tx.
*   **Procedure:** **Posteromedial Soft Tissue Release (PMSTR)**.
    *   Release of tight tendons (Z-lengthening of Tendoachilles, Tibialis Posterior, FHL, FDL).
    *   Release of tight ligaments/capsules (Posterior ankle capsule, Subtalar capsule, Talonavicular capsule, Spring ligament).
*   **Incision:** Cincinnati incision (transverse) or Turco’s incision (curvilinear medial).

**B. Tendon Transfers**
*   **Indication:** Dynamic Supination (child pulls foot into varus while walking) in children > 3-5 years.
*   **Procedure:** **Tibialis Anterior Transfer** (transferring the tendon to the lateral cuneiform to act as a dorsiflexor/evertor).

**C. Bony Procedures (Salverage Procedures)**
Used for older children (usually > 4-5 years) or neglected cases where soft tissue release is insufficient due to bony deformity.

| Procedure | Age Group | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dwyer’s Osteotomy** | > 3-4 yrs | Calcancal osteotomy (open wedge medial or closed wedge lateral) to correct varus. |
| **Dilwyn Evans Procedure** | 4-8 yrs | Calcaneocuboid fusion to shorten the lateral column. |
| **Wedge Tarsectomy** | 8-10 yrs | Removal of a bony wedge from the midfoot to correct adduction/varus. |
| **Triple Arthrodesis** | > 10-12 yrs | Fusion of Subtalar, Talonavicular, and Calcaneocuboid joints. (Salvage for painful rigid foot). |
| **Ilizarov / JESS** | Any age | Differential distraction using external fixators (Joshi’s External Stabilization System) for severe/neglected cases. |

### Complications
1.  **Rocker Bottom Foot:** Caused by forceful correction of equinus before correcting the varus/adduction. The foot "breaks" at the midtarsal joint (spurious correction).
2.  **Recurrence:** Common if bracing protocol is not followed.
3.  **Flat Top Talus:** Avascular necrosis or flattening of the talus due to forceful manipulation.
4.  **Under-correction / Over-correction.**
