# **SCRUB TYPHUS (Tsutsugamushi Fever)**

**Scrub Typhus**, also known as **Tsutsugamushi fever**, is a zoonotic rickettsial disease caused by *Rickettsia tsutsugamushi* (now reclassified as *Orientia tsutsugamushi*). It is widely distributed in South East Asia, including India.

### **1. Epidemiological Determinants**

*   **Agent:** [[Rickettsia tsutsugamushi]] (Orientia tsutsugamushi).
    *   It is an obligate intracellular parasite.
*   **Vector:** **Trombiculid Mite** (Chigger).
    *   Important species: *Leptotrombidium deliense* and *L. akamushi*.
    *   **Crucial Exam Point:** The **Larva** (Chigger) is the *only* parasitic stage that bites vertebrates. The nymph and adult stages are free-living in the soil and feed on vegetation.
*   **Reservoir:**
    *   **Primary Reservoir:** Trombiculid mites. The infection is maintained in nature through **transovarial transmission** (from female mite to eggs),.
    *   **Secondary Reservoir:** Small mammals like field mice, rats, and shrews.
*   **Host:** Man is an **accidental** and dead-end host,.

### **2. Mode of Transmission**

*   **Bite of infected Larval Mite (Chigger)**.
*   Transmission cycle: Mite $\rightarrow$ Rat/Mouse $\rightarrow$ Mite.
*   There is **NO** person-to-person transmission.

### **3. Clinical Features**

*   **Incubation Period:** Usually **10–12 days** (range 6–21 days).
*   **Onset:** Acute onset with chills, high grade fever ($104^{\circ}-105^{\circ}$F), and severe headache,.
*   **Specific Signs:**
    1.  **[[Eschar]] (The Black Scab):** A punched-out ulcer covered with a blackened scab at the site of the mite bite. It is the most characteristic feature,.
    2.  **Rash:** A macular rash appears around the **5th day** of illness.
    3.  **Lymphadenopathy:** Generalized lymphadenopathy is common.

**Mnemonic for Clinical Features:** **"S-C-R-U-B"**
*   **S** - **S**wellings (Lymphadenopathy)
*   **C** - **C**higger bite
*   **R** - **R**ash (Macular)
*   **U** - **U**lcer ([[Eschar]]) - *Hallmark!*
*   **B** - **B**ad Headache & Fever

### **4. Laboratory Diagnosis**

| Test | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Serology** | **[[Weil-Felix Reaction]]**: Strongly positive with Proteus strain **OXK**. <br> *Note: It is unreliable in 50% of cases but historically significant*. |
| **Isolation** | Inoculation of patient's blood into mice to isolate the organism. |
| **Newer Methods** | ELISA, Immunofluorescence, PCR. |

**Clinical Relevance:**
The **Weil-Felix reaction** uses different Proteus antigens for different Rickettsial diseases. Remember **"OXK is OK for Scrub"**.
*   Epidemic/Endemic Typhus: OX-19
*   Scrub Typhus: **OX-K**.

### **5. Treatment**

*   **Drug of Choice:** [[Tetracycline]] or **[[Doxycycline]]**,.
*   *Note:* With proper therapy, mortality is practically nil.
*   **Sulfonamides** are contraindicated as they enhance rickettsial growth.

### **6. Prevention and Control**

There is **no effective vaccine** available at present. Control relies on:

1.  **Vector Control:**
    *   Clearing vegetation/scrub where rats and mice live.
    *   Application of insecticides like **Lindane** or **Chlordane** to the ground.
2.  **Personal Prophylaxis:**
    *   Impregnating clothes/blankets with miticidal chemicals like **Benzyl benzoate**.
    *   Application of mite repellents like **Diethyltoluamide ([[DEET]])** to exposed skin.
