# Nasal Vestibulitis

### Definition
**Nasal Vestibulitis** is a diffuse dermatitis of the [[nasal vestibule]]. It involves the skin-lined area just inside the nostrils which contains hair follicles (vibrissae).

It must be distinguished from **[[Furunculosis]]**, which is a localized acute infection of a specific hair follicle, though vestibulitis often involves multiple hair follicles and the surrounding skin.

### Etiology
The primary pathology is usually secondary to chronic irritation or trauma to the vestibular skin.

**1. Causative Organism**
*   The most common pathogen is **[[Staphylococcus aureus]]**.
*   Occasionally [[Streptococcus]] species are involved.

**2. Predisposing Factors**
*   **Chronic Nasal Discharge:** Constant rhinorrhea due to [[allergic rhinitis]], [[sinusitis]], or upper respiratory tract infections causes maceration and irritation of the vestibular skin.
*   **Trauma (Nose Picking):** Habitual finger-nail trauma (rhinotillexis) introduces bacteria and damages the epithelial barrier.
*   **Mechanical Irritation:** Frequent rubbing of the nose or use of handkerchiefs/tissues.
*   **Plucking of Vibrissae:** Pulling out nasal hair can lead to infection of the root.
*   **Iatrogenic:** Use of nasal packing or frequent instrumentation.

> **Clinical Implication:** In any patient presenting with vestibulitis, always examine the nasal cavity and sinuses to rule out an underlying cause of discharge (e.g., a foreign body in children or chronic sinusitis in adults).

### Classification and Clinical Features
Vestibulitis manifests in two primary forms: Acute and Chronic.

| Feature | **Acute Vestibulitis** | **Chronic Vestibulitis** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Onset** | Sudden | Insidious/Long-standing |
| **Symptoms** | Intense pain, tenderness, itching | Discomfort, itching, persistent irritation |
| **Appearance** | Vestibular skin is red, swollen, and tense | Skin is thickened and indurated (hardened) |
| **Surface** | Covered with **crusts and scales**; underlying skin may be eroded or excoriated | Presence of **painful fissures** (cracks) and crusting |
| **Extension** | May spread to involve the upper lip and face | Usually confined to the vestibule |

### Complications
The [[nasal vestibule]] is part of the "dangerous area of the face." The veins in this region (angular vein, deep facial vein) are valveless and communicate directly with the [[cavernous sinus]].

*   **[[Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis]] (CST):** Retrograde spread of infection can lead to septic thrombosis of the cavernous sinus. This is a life-threatening complication characterized by high fever, chemosis, proptosis, and ophthalmoplegia.
*   **Facial Cellulitis:** Spreading infection to the upper lip and face.
*   **Septal Abscess:** Infection may spread to the sub-perichondrial space of the septum.
*   **Stenosis of Nares:** Chronic inflammation and scarring (or surgical management of sequelae) can lead to stenosis or atresia of the anterior nares.

### Differential Diagnosis
*   **[[Nasal Furunculosis]]:** Localized boil centered around a hair follicle; extremely tender.
*   **Herpes Simplex:** Vesicular lesions, often recurrent.
*   **[[Squamous Cell Carcinoma]] / [[Basal Cell Carcinoma]]:** Non-healing ulcers or persistent crusting should raise suspicion of malignancy, especially in older adults.
*   **Foreign Body:** Especially in children with unilateral vestibulitis and discharge.

### Management

**1. Local Care (Mainstay of Treatment)**
*   **Cleaning:** Removal of crusts and scales is essential. This should be done gently using a cotton applicator soaked in **hydrogen peroxide** or warm saline.
*   **Topical Application:** Application of **antibiotic-steroid ointment** (e.g., Neosporin or Mupirocin combined with a mild steroid). This reduces both infection and inflammation.
    *   *Note:* Application should continue for a few days even after apparent cure to prevent relapse.

**2. Systemic Treatment**
*   **Antibiotics:** Systemic antibiotics (e.g., Cloxacillin, Erythromycin, or Cefaclor) are indicated if there is significant cellulitis, furunculosis, or systemic signs.
*   **Analgesics:** NSAIDs (e.g., Aceclofenac) to reduce pain and inflammation.

**3. Treatment of Specific Lesions**
*   **Fissures:** Chronic painful fissures can be cauterized with **[[Silver Nitrate]]**.

**4. Treatment of Underlying Cause**
*   Manage the source of rhinorrhea (e.g., antihistamines for allergy, antibiotics for sinusitis) to keep the vestibule dry.
*   Counsel the patient against nose picking (digital trauma).

### Easy Mnemonic for Management: **"CLEAN"**
*   **C** - Clean crusts (H2O2)
*   **L** - Local Ointment (Antibiotic + Steroid)
*   **E** - Eradicate source (Sinusitis/Rhinitis)
*   **A** - Antibiotics (Systemic if severe)
*   **N** - No picking (Avoid trauma)
