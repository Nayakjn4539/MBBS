# [[Paget's Disease of Bone]] (Osteitis Deformans)

### Definition
A chronic disorder of the adult skeleton characterized by excessive and abnormal bone remodeling. The normal equilibrium between bone resorption and formation is disrupted, leading to bones that are enlarged, thickened, and structurally weak (brittle).
*   **Synonym:** [[Osteitis Deformans]] (coined by Sir James Paget in 1877).
*   **Nature:** It can be **Monostotic** (affecting a single bone) or **Polyostotic** (affecting multiple bones).

### Epidemiology
*   **Age:** Rare before 40 years; incidence increases significantly with age.
*   **Gender:** Males are affected more frequently than females (Ratio ~ 3:2 to 2:1).
*   **Geography:** Common in UK, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. Rare in Asia and Africa.,

### Etiology
The exact cause is unknown, but two major factors are implicated:
1.  **Genetic Factors:**
    *   Positive family history is often present.
    *   Mutations in the **SQSTM1 gene** (Sequestosome 1).
    *   Mutation of **PDB2** on chromosome 18q22.1 (encodes [[RANK]] protein).
2.  **Viral Infection:**
    *   Slow virus infection of [[osteoclasts]].
    *   Suspected agents: **Paramyxovirus** (measles), Canine distemper virus, Respiratory syncytial virus.,,

### Pathophysiology
The disease progresses through three distinct phases of abnormal bone turnover:

| Phase | Pathological Activity | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Lytic Phase (Osteoclastic)** | Intense focal bone resorption. | Marked by excessive [[osteoclast]] activity. The bone is resorbed rapidly. |
| **2. Mixed Phase (Lytic & Blastic)** | Resorption continues, but compensatory bone formation begins. | The marrow is replaced by vascular fibrous tissue. New bone is laid down rapidly and chaotically (woven bone). |
| **3. Sclerotic Phase (Blastic/Quiescent)** | Resorption declines; hard, dense bone is formed. | The final bone is enlarged, dense, and irregular but architecturally weak. The marrow becomes sclerotic. |

*   **Microscopy:** The hallmark feature is the **Mosaic Pattern** of lamellar bone with irregular cement lines (indicating chaotic remodeling) without Haversian systems.,,

### Clinical Features
Many patients are **asymptomatic** and diagnosed incidentally via X-rays or elevated Alkaline Phosphatase levels. When symptomatic, features include:

**1. Pain**
*   Most common symptom.
*   Deep, dull, constant aching bone pain.
*   Typically worse at night.
*   May also result from secondary osteoarthritis or nerve compression.,

**2. Bone Enlargement and Deformity**
*   **Skull:** The skull enlarges; the patient may report that their "hat size has increased."
*   **Face:** [[Leontiasis ossea]] (Lion-like face) due to facial bone involvement.
*   **Spine:** Kyphosis may develop; patient height decreases.
*   **Long Bones:**
    *   **Tibia:** Anterior bowing (Sabre tibia).
    *   **Femur:** Anterolateral bowing.
    *   The limb feels thick and looks bent.,

**3. Cutaneous Temperature**
*   The skin over the affected bone feels **warm** to the touch.
*   **Cause:** Increased vascularity of the underlying bone (periosteal hypervascularity).

**4. Neurological Symptoms**
*   **Deafness:** Due to otosclerosis or compression of the [[auditory nerve]] (CN VIII) by the thickened skull base.
*   **Cranial Nerve Palsies:** Compression of nerves in the foramina (e.g., optic nerve, facial nerve).
*   **Spinal Stenosis:** Vertebral thickening causing cord or root compression.,,

### Complications

*   **Pathological Fractures:**
    *   Bones are brittle despite being thick.
    *   **Banana Fracture:** Transverse fractures resembling a snapped banana/chalk stick occur frequently in the femur or tibia.
    *   High rate of non-union.
*   **Osteoarthritis:** Secondary changes in joints adjacent to deformed bones (e.g., hip or knee).
*   **High-Output Cardiac Failure:** Due to massively increased blood flow through the vascular bone (acting like an AV shunt). Occurs in polyostotic disease involving >30% of the skeleton.
*   **Malignant Transformation:**
    *   Occurs in <1% of cases.
    *   Development of **[[Osteosarcoma]]** in an elderly patient.
    *   Suspect if there is sudden increase in pain or swelling in a known Pagetic bone.
    *   Prognosis is extremely poor.
*   **Hypercalcemia:** Rare, usually occurs if a patient is immobilized.,,,

### Investigations

#### 1. Biochemistry
*   **Serum [[Alkaline Phosphatase]] (ALP):** Markedly **ELEVATED**. It reflects osteoblastic activity and bone turnover.
*   **Serum Calcium & Phosphate:** Usually **NORMAL**. (Calcium may rise during immobilization).
*   **Urinary Hydroxyproline:** Elevated (indicates collagen breakdown/resorption).,,

#### 2. Radiology (X-Ray)
Findings vary by phase:
*   **General:** Bone enlargement, cortical thickening, and coarse trabeculae.
*   **Skull:**
    *   **Osteoporosis Circumscripta:** Large lytic lesions (Lytic phase).
    *   **Cotton Wool Appearance:** Patchy sclerosis (Mixed/Blastic phase).
    *   **Tam O' Shanter Skull:** Thickened diploe giving the appearance of a Scottish cap.
*   **Spine:**
    *   **Picture Frame Vertebra:** Peripheral sclerosis with a radiolucent center.
    *   **Ivory Vertebra:** Homogenously dense vertebra.
*   **Long Bones:**
    *   **Blade of Grass / Flame Sign:** Advancing wedge of resorption (V-shaped lytic defect) in the diaphysis.
    *   Bowing deformities.,,

#### 3. Bone Scintigraphy (Bone Scan)
*   Uses Technetium-99m.
*   Shows intense, increased uptake ("Hot Spots").
*   More sensitive than X-ray for detecting early lesions.,

#### 4. Bone Biopsy
*   Confirmatory; shows the characteristic **Mosaic Pattern** of irregular cement lines.

### Differential Diagnosis
*   Metastatic Bone Disease (Prostate cancer can cause sclerotic lesions).
*   [[Fibrous Dysplasia]].
*   Vertebral Hemangioma (for spinal lesions).
*   [[Osteomyelitis]] (Chronic).

### Treatment

Most asymptomatic patients do not require treatment.

#### 1. Medical Management
**Indications:** Bone pain, neurological compression, high-output cardiac failure, hypercalcemia, preparation for orthopedic surgery, or prevention of deformity in active disease.

*   **[[Bisphosphonates]] (Drug of Choice):**
    *   Inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.
    *   **Zoledronic acid:** Intravenous (most effective).
    *   **Alendronate / Risedronate:** Oral.
    *   **Pamidronate:** Intravenous.
*   **[[Calcitonin]]:**
    *   Inhibits osteoclasts. Used if bisphosphonates are not tolerated or for rapid pain relief. Administered subcutaneously or intranasally.
*   **Pain Management:** NSAIDs and analgesics.,,

#### 2. Surgical Management
*   **Fracture Fixation:** Internal fixation for pathological fractures. Intramedullary nails are preferred for femoral shaft fractures.
*   **Osteotomy:** To correct severe deformities (e.g., tibial bowing) causing joint pain.
*   **Joint Replacement:** For secondary osteoarthritis.
*   **Decompression:** For spinal stenosis or nerve root compression.,

### Clinical Implications
*   **Warning Sign:** In an elderly patient (>50 years), the sudden onset of severe pain and swelling in a long bone should raise suspicion of **secondary osteosarcoma** arising from Paget's disease.
*   **Pre-op Caution:** Surgery on Pagetic bone is associated with excessive bleeding due to hypervascularity. Pre-treatment with bisphosphonates helps reduce vascularity.
