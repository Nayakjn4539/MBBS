# [[Medicine And Social Sciences]] > Sociology and Health

### **Sociology and Health**

**Sociology** is derived from the Latin word *socio* (society) and Greek word *logos* (science). It is the study of human relationships and human behavior for a better understanding of the pattern of human life. While psychology studies the individual, sociology studies the **group**.

### **Medical Sociology**
Medical sociology is a specialized branch that applies sociological concepts to health and disease. It was first proposed by **Charles McIntire** in 1894.

It is defined as the professional endeavor devoted to:
*   [[Social Epidemiology]]
*   Study of cultural factors and social relations in connection with illness.
*   Social principles in medical organization and treatment.

**Scope of Medical Sociology:**
1.  Study of the medical profession.
2.  Relationship of medicine to the public.
3.  Social factors in the aetiology, prevalence, incidence, and interpretation of disease.

| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Society]]** | A group of individuals who have organized themselves and follow a given way of life. The outstanding feature is a **system of social relationships**. |
| **[[Community]]** | A social group determined by geographical boundaries and/or common values and interests. Members know and interact with each other. |
| **Social Structure** | The pattern of inter-relations between persons. It includes institutions, groups, and status hierarchy (comparable to Anatomy). |
| **Social Organization** | How the structure functions (comparable to Physiology). |
| **[[Socialization]]** | The process by which an individual gradually acquires culture and becomes a member of a social group. |
| **[[Socialized Medicine]]** | Provision of medical service and education by the State, but the program is operated/regulated by **professional groups** rather than the government. |
| **State Medicine** | Provision of free medical services to the people at government expense (controlled by the government). |
| **Customs** | Technically divided into **Folkways** (right way of doing things) and **Mores** (stringent customs, e.g., taboos). |

### **The Family as a Social Unit**
The [[Family]] is the primary unit of all societies and acts as an **epidemiological unit**.

**Functions of Family relevant to Health:**
1.  **Child Rearing:** Physical care of the dependent young; patterns of nutrition and hygiene are passed down.
2.  **Socialization:** Teaching the young the values of society; latent function.
3.  **Personality Formation:** Early family experience determines the capacity to withstand stress.
4.  **Care of Dependent Adults:** Care of the sick, injured, pregnant women, and the aged.
5.  **Stabilization of Adult Personality:** The family acts as a **"Shock Absorber"** to the stress and strains of life.

**Mnemonic for Family Functions:** **S**hock **A**bsorber **F**or **C**hildren
*   **S**tabilization of adult personality
*   **A**dult care (dependent)
*   **F**amilial susceptibility to disease
*   **C**hild rearing & Socialization

### **Sociological Theories of Disease**

*   **Parsonian Theory:** Illness is not just a biologically altered state but a **socially altered state**. This gave rise to the concept of the **"Sick Role"** (The sick person is exempted from normal social responsibilities but has the obligation to seek competent help and get well).
*   **Marxist Theory:** Concerned with the relationship between health and capitalist social organization. Suggests the cause of disease is putting **profit ahead of health**.
*   **Feminist Theory:** Focuses on how gender inequality shapes social life; disease may be due to the social role of women enforced by men.

### **Cultural Factors in Health and Disease**
Culture is "learned behavior which has been socially acquired".

*   **Personal Hygiene:** Use of *neem* twigs (oral hygiene), oil baths, barefoot walking (Hookworm), open defecation.
*   **Nutrition:** Vegetarianism, fasting, cooking habits (loss of vitamins), food taboos during pregnancy (e.g., papaya).
*   **Maternal & Child Health:** Early marriage, purdah system, delivery by untrained *dais*, applying *kajal* to eyes (Trachoma risk), branding of skin for cure.
*   **Immunity:** Beliefs that diseases like Smallpox/Chickenpox are wrath of Goddesses (Sheetala Mata).

### **Clinical Relevance**
*   **Doctor-Patient Relationship:** A successful doctor must communicate on an emotional, cultural, and intellectual plane.
*   **Compliance:** Understanding the social structure and family dynamics improves patient compliance with treatment (e.g., DOTS in TB).
*   **[[Medical Social Worker]]:** A professional who helps sick people by using the patient's capabilities and community resources to solve personal/social adjustments related to illness.
