# Dynamics of the Vitreous Humour

The [[Vitreous Humour]] is a transparent, inert, hydrophilic gel that fills the posterior four-fifths (80%) of the eyeball cavity. While structurally stable in youth, it undergoes significant dynamic changes with age and pathology, primarily involving the transition from a gel to a liquid state (Gel-Sol transformation).

### 1. Anatomical and Biochemical Basis
The physical properties and dynamics of the vitreous are dictated by its composition and structural arrangement.

*   **Composition:**
    *   **Water:** Constitutes 98-99% of the volume.
    *   **Collagen:** Primarily **Type II collagen** fibrils arranged in a random network.
    *   **Hyaluronic Acid (HA):** Large spheroidal macromolecules that fill the spaces between collagen fibrils, stabilizing the network and retaining water.
    *   **Cells:** **Hyalocytes** (phagocytes) and fibroblasts, located primarily in the cortical vitreous.

*   **Structural Divisions:**
    1.  **Cortical Vitreous:** The outer shell (peripheral zone). It contains more collagen fibrils and cells (hyalocytes). It is the "metabolic center" of the vitreous.
    2.  **Medullary Vitreous (Nucleus):** The central part. It is cell-free, has fewer fibrils, and is a true biological gel.
    3.  **Cloquet's Canal (Hyaloid Canal):** A channel running from the optic disc to the posterior lens surface (remnant of the primary vitreous/hyaloid artery).

### 2. Dynamics of Vitreous Attachments
The vitreous is not uniformly attached to the surrounding structures. The strength of these adhesions determines the dynamics of detachment and traction.

| Site of Attachment | Strength | Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Vitreous Base]]** | **Strongest** | 4mm zone straddling the [[Ora Serrata]]. Vitreous cannot be separated here without tearing the retina. |
| **Ligament of Weigert** | Strong (in youth) | Circular attachment to the posterior lens capsule. Weakens with age. |
| **Optic Disc Margin** | Moderate/Weak | Separation causes **Weiss Ring** (a floater). |
| **Macula/Fovea** | Weak | Traction here causes macular holes or edema. |
| **Retinal Vessels** | Weak | Paravascular attachments; traction can cause vitreous hemorrhage. |

### 3. Physiological Dynamics
*   **Mechanical Support:** Stabilizes the globe volume and cushions the retina against trauma.
*   **Optical Function:** Transmits light; transparency is maintained by the specific arrangement of collagen and hyaluronic acid.
*   **Metabolic Pathway:**
    *   Acts as a pathway for nutrients to reach the lens and retina.
    *   **Ascorbate Concentration:** The vitreous:plasma ratio of ascorbate is **9:1**, acting as a scavenger for free radicals.
    *   Glucose diffuses from the aqueous through the vitreous to the lens (approx. 10%).

### 4. Pathological Dynamics: Aging and Degeneration
The most significant dynamic process in the vitreous is **Syneresis** (collapse) and **Synchysis** (liquefaction), leading to [[Posterior Vitreous Detachment]] (PVD).

#### A. Vitreous Liquefaction (Synchysis)
*   **Mechanism:** With age, the delicate collagen-hyaluronic acid association breaks down.
*   **Process:** Depolymerization of hyaluronic acid releases water, and collagen fibrils aggregate into bundles.
*   **Result:** Formation of liquid pockets (lacunae) within the gel, primarily in the central (medullary) vitreous.
*   **Clinical Appearance:** Seen as "floaters" (shadows cast by condensed collagen fibrils on the retina).

#### B. Vitreous Collapse (Syneresis)
*   As liquefaction progresses, the solid gel framework collapses.
*   This reduces the structural support provided to the posterior hyaloid membrane.

#### C. Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD)
*   **Definition:** Separation of the cortical vitreous (posterior hyaloid membrane) from the [[Internal Limiting Membrane]] (ILM) of the retina.
*   **Mechanism:** Fluid from liquefied vitreous lacunae seeps through holes in the posterior hyaloid membrane or due to loss of retinal adherence, dissecting the interface between the vitreous cortex and the retina.
*   **Sequence:** Usually begins in the perifoveal area and spreads to the optic disc.
*   **Incidence:** Common > 65 years, high myopes, aphakics, and diabetics.

**Clinical Features of PVD:**
1.  **Floaters:** Sudden onset of mobile opacities (aggregated collagen or blood).
2.  **Photopsia (Flashes):** Caused by mechanical stimulation of the retina at sites of vitreoretinal adhesion during eye movement.
3.  **Weiss Ring:** A ring-like opacity representing the detached attachment from the optic disc.

### 5. Vitreoretinal Traction Dynamics
The dynamics of the vitreous are crucial in the pathogenesis of retinal tears.
*   **Dynamic Traction:** Saccadic eye movements create dynamic forces exerted by the vitreous gel on the retina at sites of strong adhesion (e.g., lattice degeneration, cystic tufts).
*   **Static Traction:** Caused by contraction of membranes (e.g., in [[Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy]]) independent of eye movement.
*   **Consequence:** If the adhesion is stronger than the retina, the dynamic force causes a **Retinal Tear** (Rhegmatogenous), potentially leading to [[Retinal Detachment]].

### 6. Dynamics of Vitreous Substitutes (Tamponades)
In vitreoretinal surgery (Vitrectomy), the vitreous is replaced by substances that alter intraocular dynamics to support the retina.

| Substitute | Mechanism/Dynamics | Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Air** | Surface tension prevents fluid entry into breaks; buoyancy pushes retina up. | ~3 days |
| **Expanding Gases (SF6, C3F8)** | Expands in volume (doubles/quadruples). Provides prolonged tamponade. | 10–28 days |
| **Silicone Oil** | Permanent tamponade. High surface tension but lower buoyancy than gas. Used for long-term support (e.g., PVR). | Until removed |
| **Perfluorocarbon Liquid (PFCL)** | "Heavy liquid" – sinks to the bottom. Used intraoperatively to flatten the retina. | Intraoperative only |

### Clinical Implications
*   **Sudden Floaters/Flashes:** Indicate acute PVD. Requires immediate dilated fundus exam to rule out retinal tears caused by dynamic traction.
*   **Shaffer's Sign (Tobacco Dusting):** Presence of pigment cells in the anterior vitreous indicates a retinal break (RPE cells released into vitreous dynamics).
*   **Vitreous Hemorrhage:** Blood in the vitreous clots rapidly and organizes due to the collagen network, taking 4-8 weeks to absorb.
