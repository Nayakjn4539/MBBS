| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)** A chronic condition from complex interactions between intestinal microbiota and host immunity in genetically predisposed individuals, leading to inappropriate mucosal immune activation. Includes Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. | Combination of abnormalities in immune regulation, host-microbe interactions, and epithelial barrier function. | Genetic predisposition (Caucasians, Ashkenazi Jews). Environmental factors (improved food storage, decreased food contamination - **"hygiene hypothesis"**). | 1. **Mucosal Immunity:** Polymorphisms in genes for immune signaling (**HLA** molecules, cytokines like interferon-γ, IL-10 receptor) lead to dysregulated responses. Th1, Th2, and Th17 pathways are involved.  2. **Autophagy and Cellular Stress:** Defects in autophagy (e.g., in ATG16L1) impair clearing of damaged organelles and intracellular pathogens. This leads to abnormal Paneth cell granules.  3. **Host-Microbial Interactions:** Changes in gut microbiome composition (**dysbiosis**), with reduced species diversity, trigger persistent and chronic inflammation in susceptible hosts. | Over 200 IBD-associated polymorphisms identified.  **NOD2:** Strongest risk gene for Crohn disease.  **ATG16L1, IRGM:** Involved in autophagy, linked to Crohn disease.  **IL-10 receptor:** Mutations linked to very early onset IBD.  Polymorphisms in HLA loci and genes for cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-23 receptor). | Varies between Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis. (See individual diseases). | Varies between Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis. (See individual diseases). | Presents in teens and early 20s. Relapsing disorder with attacks of bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and cramps. | **ANCA** (perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) are found in 75% of UC patients.  **ASCA** (antibodies to Saccharomyces cerevisiae) are more common in Crohn disease. | 1. **Crohn Disease** 2. **Ulcerative Colitis** 3. **Indeterminate Colitis** (up to 10% of cases with overlapping features). | **Colitis-Associated Neoplasia** (dysplasia and carcinoma). Risk increases after 8-10 years of disease.  Extraintestinal manifestations: migratory polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, ankylosing spondylitis, uveitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis. | Anti-inflammatory agents, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, biologic therapies (anti-TNF antibodies, etc.), targeted kinase inhibitors. Colectomy for severe cases. |
| **Colorectal Cancer** Adenocarcinoma of the colon, the most common malignancy of the GI tract. | Develops from pre-existing adenomas (neoplastic polyps) through a stepwise accumulation of mutations. | Low intake of unabsorbable vegetable fiber, high intake of refined carbohydrates and fat. Chronic inflammation (IBD). Familial syndromes (FAP, HNPCC). Age >50. | Two main pathways: 1. **Adenoma-Carcinoma Sequence (APC/β-catenin pathway, ~80% of cases):**   - Loss of **APC** (tumor suppressor gene).   - β-catenin accumulates, translocates to nucleus, activates genes (**MYC**, **cyclin D1**) promoting proliferation.   - Later, activating mutations in **KRAS** and loss of tumor suppressors like **TP53** and **SMAD2/4** (TGF-β signaling). 2. **Mismatch Repair (MSI) Pathway (~15% of cases):**  - Defect in DNA mismatch repair genes (e.g., **MLH1, MSH2**).  - Leads to **microsatellite instability (MSI)**, where mutations accumulate rapidly in microsatellite repeats.  - Mutations in genes like **TGFBR2** and **BAX** promote growth and survival. | **APC/β-catenin Pathway:** - **APC** gene loss (early event). - Activating mutations in **KRAS**. - Loss of **TP53**, **SMAD2**, **SMAD4**.  **MSI Pathway:** - Loss of function mutations in **MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2**. - Activating mutations in **BRAF** (often with MLH1 hypermethylation). - Mutations in **TGFBR2, BAX**. | **Proximal (Right) Colon:** Polypoid, exophytic masses. Rarely cause obstruction. **Distal (Left) Colon:** Annular, "**napkin-ring**" constrictions that narrow the lumen and cause obstruction. | Most are tall columnar cells resembling adenomas, eliciting a strong stromal **desmoplastic response** (firm consistency). May be poorly differentiated (few glands) or have abundant mucin or signet-ring cells (poor prognosis). MSI tumors often have prominent mucinous differentiation and peritumoral lymphocytic infiltrates. | Often insidious.  **Right-sided cancers:** Fatigue and weakness due to iron deficiency anemia. **Left-sided cancers:** Occult bleeding, changes in bowel habits, cramping, left lower quadrant discomfort. | **CDX2** transcription factor can be a prognostic biomarker. Testing for **MSI** (by PCR or immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair proteins) is important for identifying HNPCC and for prognosis/therapy decisions. | **TNM classification** (Tumor-Nodes-Metastasis) is used for staging. Depth of invasion (T) and presence of lymph node metastases (N) are most important prognostic factors. | Metastases to regional lymph nodes, liver (most common distant site), lungs, and bones. | Surgical resection is the preferred treatment. Chemotherapy for advanced stages. Pharmacologic chemoprevention with aspirin/NSAIDs may have a protective effect by inhibiting COX-2. |
| **Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD)** Chronic mucosal ulceration affecting the duodenum or stomach. A benign gastric ulcer is a PUD; a malignant one is an ulcerated Gastric Adenocarcinoma. | Almost always associated with **H. pylori infection**, **NSAIDs**, or cigarette smoking. An imbalance between mucosal defenses and damaging factors (gastric acid, pepsin). | H. pylori infection, chronic NSAID use, smoking, alcoholic cirrhosis, psychological stress, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. | Develops on a background of chronic gastritis.  **H. pylori-induced antral gastritis:** Leads to increased gastric acid secretion and decreased duodenal bicarbonate, favoring ulceration.  **NSAIDs:** Inhibit COX-dependent synthesis of prostaglandins, which impairs mucus secretion, bicarbonate secretion, mucosal blood flow, and epithelial regeneration. | - | Usually solitary (>80%). Round to oval, sharply "**punched-out**" defect. Base is smooth and clean. Margin is level with surrounding mucosa (unlike malignant ulcers which have **heaped-up margins**). Radiating mucosal folds can be seen. Located most often in proximal duodenum or gastric antrum. | Ulcer base has four layers (from lumen outward): 1. Necrotic/fibrinoid debris 2. Neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate 3. Granulation tissue 4. Fibrous/collagenous scar Thickened, occasionally thrombosed vessels may be present in the scar. | Epigastric burning or aching pain, typically 1-3 hours after meals, worse at night, and relieved by alkali or food. Nausea, vomiting, bloating, belching. May present with complications. | - | **Gastric Ulcer** vs. **Duodenal Ulcer**. Can also be classified by location and association (e.g., Curling ulcer in burn patients, Cushing ulcer in intracranial disease). | **Bleeding** (most frequent complication, may be life-threatening). **Perforation** (surgical emergency, causes two-thirds of ulcer-related deaths). **Obstruction** (from edema or scarring, especially in pyloric channel). | **H. pylori eradication** (antibiotics). Acid neutralization/suppression (Proton pump inhibitors). Withdrawal of offending agents like NSAIDs. |
| **Gastric Adenocarcinoma** The most common malignancy of the stomach (>90% of gastric cancers). | Largely attributed to **H. pylori infection** (especially for intestinal-type). Chronic gastritis, particularly with mucosal atrophy and intestinal metaplasia, is a major precursor. | H. pylori infection. Low socioeconomic status. Diet high in N-nitroso compounds and salt, low in fresh fruit/vegetables. Familial syndromes. Partial gastrectomy. Barrett esophagus for cardia cancers. | **Intestinal-type:** Develops from precursor lesions (dysplasia in a background of chronic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia). Follows a stepwise mutation model similar to the **APC/β-catenin pathway** in the colon. **Diffuse-type:** Arises de novo from gastric mucosa, not associated with specific precursor lesions. Key event is loss of E-cadherin cell adhesion. Infiltrates as single cells. | **Intestinal-type:** Strongly associated with mutations that increase signaling via the **Wnt pathway**, including loss-of-function of **APC** or gain-of-function of the β-catenin gene. Also loss of **TGFβRII, BAX, CDKN2A**. **Diffuse-type:** Strongly associated with germline or sporadic loss-of-function mutations in **CDH1** (encodes E-cadherin). CDH1 silencing by promoter hypermethylation is also common. | **Intestinal-type:** Forms bulky tumors, either as an exophytic mass or an ulcerated infiltrative tumor with heaped-up margins. Occurs most often in the antrum. **Diffuse-type:** Infiltrative growth pattern. Stiffens the gastric wall, causing a "leather bottle" appearance called **linitis plastica**. No discrete mass is formed. | **Intestinal-type:** Composed of glandular structures, often with apical mucin vacuoles. Grows in broad cohesive fronts. **Diffuse-type:** Composed of discohesive, individual cells, often with a **signet-ring cell** morphology (large mucin vacuole pushing nucleus to the periphery). Do not form glands. | Early symptoms resemble chronic gastritis (dyspepsia, dysphagia, nausea). Later symptoms include weight loss, anorexia, early satiety (especially diffuse), anemia, hemorrhage. | - | Classified by morphology: 1. **Intestinal type** (bulky, glandular) 2. **Diffuse type** (infiltrative, signet-ring cell) | Metastasis is often present at diagnosis. Common sites: Supraclavicular node (**Virchow node**), periumbilical nodes (**Sister Mary Joseph nodule**), ovary (**Krukenberg tumor**), left axillary lymph node, pouch of Douglas. | Surgical resection is the preferred treatment. Chemotherapy or radiation for advanced cases. |
| **Typhoid Fever** Systemic disease caused by Salmonella typhi or paratyphi, characterized by ulceration of Peyer's patches. Also called Enteric Fever. | Infection with **Salmonella enterica**, serotypes **typhi** or **paratyphi**. | Travel to endemic areas (India, Mexico, Philippines, etc.). Consumption of contaminated food or water. Humans are the only reservoir. | 1. Ingestion of bacteria, which are resistant to gastric acid.  2. Bacteria invade via small intestinal **M cells**.  3. They disseminate via lymphatic and blood vessels, causing systemic reactive hyperplasia of phagocytes and lymphoid tissues.  4. Re-seeding of the gut leads to characteristic ulceration. | - | Enlarged **Peyer's patches** in the terminal ileum form plateau-like elevations. Mucosal damage creates **oval ulcers, oriented along the long axis of the ileum**. Spleen is enlarged and soft. Liver may have small necrotic foci. | Neutrophils accumulate in superficial lamina propria. Macrophages containing bacteria, red cells, and nuclear debris are seen. Liver shows small, randomly scattered foci of necrosis with macrophage aggregates, called **typhoid nodules**, which are also seen in bone marrow and lymph nodes. | Starts with anorexia, abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, and bloody diarrhea. Followed by a bacteremic phase with fever and flu-like symptoms. "**Rose spots**" (small erythematous maculopapular lesions) may appear on the chest and abdomen. | Blood cultures are positive in >90% of individuals during the febrile phase. | - | Intestinal perforation, encephalopathy, meningitis, myocarditis, pneumonia. Chronic carrier state in the gallbladder. Salmonella osteomyelitis (especially in sickle cell disease). | Antibiotic treatment. |
| **Crohn's Disease** An IBD that may involve any area of the GI tract (mouth to anus) and is typically transmural. Also known as regional enteritis. | Idiopathic, but involves a combination of genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers, and dysregulated immune responses to gut microbiota. | Caucasian race, Ashkenazi Jewish descent. **Cigarette smoking is a strong risk factor**. Family history of IBD. | 1. Begins with small **aphthous ulcers**, which coalesce into elongated, serpentine ulcers.  2. Patchy distribution results in sparing of interspersed mucosa, creating a **cobblestone** appearance.  3. Inflammation becomes transmural, leading to wall thickening, fibrosis, and strictures.  4. Deep fissures can form fistula tracts. | **NOD2** (strongest risk gene).  **ATG16L1**, **IRGM** (autophagy genes). Polymorphisms in genes related to Th1/Th17 immune pathways. | **Skip lesions** (multiple, separate, sharply delineated areas of disease). Most commonly involves terminal ileum, ileocecal valve, and cecum.  Intestinal wall is thickened and rubbery.  Strictures are common.  Mesenteric fat extends over the serosal surface ("**creeping fat**"). | Abundant neutrophils infiltrate and destroy crypts (**cryptitis** and **crypt abscesses**).  **Transmural inflammation** is characteristic.  Hallmark: **Noncaseating granulomas** (found in ~35% of cases, in any layer of the wall or in lymph nodes).  Chronic changes include crypt distortion and pseudopyloric/Paneth cell metaplasia. | Highly variable. Intermittent mild diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain. May present with malabsorption, hypoalbuminemia, or vitamin B12 deficiency (with ileal disease). Right lower quadrant pain can mimic appendicitis. | Antibodies to **Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ASCA)** are common. | Classified by location:  - Small intestine only (~40%)  - Small intestine and colon (~30%)  - Colon only (remainder) | **Fistulae** (to bladder, vagina, skin, or other bowel loops), **fibrosing strictures**, perforation, peritoneal abscesses. Malabsorption. Increased risk of colonic adenocarcinoma (if colon is involved). | Anti-inflammatory agents, corticosteroids, immunosuppressives, biologic therapies (e.g., anti-TNF antibodies). Surgical resection for strictures is common, but disease often recurs at the anastomosis. |
| **Ulcerative Colitis** An IBD limited to the colon and rectum, affecting only the mucosa and submucosa. | Idiopathic, resulting from a combination of genetic susceptibility and dysregulated immune responses to gut microbiota. | Caucasian race, Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Family history of IBD. Smoking cessation may trigger onset; smoking may be partially protective. | 1. Disease always begins in the rectum and extends proximally in a **continuous** fashion.  2. Inflammation is limited to the mucosa and submucosa, leading to broad-based ulcerations.  3. Regenerating mucosa bulges into lumen to form **pseudopolyps**.  4. Chronic disease leads to mucosal atrophy.  5. Neuromuscular dysfunction in severe cases can lead to toxic megacolon. | Polymorphisms in HLA genes, and genes related to Th2/Th17 immune pathways. NOD2 mutations are NOT associated with UC. | Continuous colonic involvement starting from the rectum. No **skip lesions**.  Mucosa may be red and granular or have extensive, broad-based ulcers.  **Pseudopolyps** are common, may fuse to form **mucosal bridges**.  The colon wall is NOT thickened, serosal surface is normal, and **strictures do not occur**. Chronic disease may lead to mucosal atrophy. | Histologic features are similar to colonic Crohn's (inflammatory infiltrates, **crypt abscesses**, crypt distortion).  Key differences:  - Inflammation is limited to mucosa and submucosa.  - **Granulomas are NOT present.**  In severe cases, ulcers may extend into submucosa. | Relapsing attacks of bloody diarrhea with stringy mucoid material, lower abdominal pain, and cramps, temporarily relieved by defecation. | **Perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA)** are found in 75% of patients. | Classified by extent of disease:  - **Ulcerative proctitis** (rectum only)  - **Ulcerative proctosigmoiditis**  - **Pancolitis** (entire colon) | **Toxic megacolon** (severe cases, risk of perforation).  High risk of colitis-associated dysplasia and adenocarcinoma, especially with pancolitis and disease duration >8 years.  Primary sclerosing cholangitis (2.5-7.5% of patients). | Medical management similar to Crohn's. Colectomy cures the intestinal disease and removes cancer risk. |
| **Barrett Esophagus** A complication of chronic GERD characterized by intestinal metaplasia within the esophageal squamous mucosa. It is a premalignant condition. | Chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). | Chronic GERD, obesity-related reflux, tobacco use, age 40-60, male gender, Caucasian race. | Chronic injury to the squamous epithelium by gastric acid leads to a metaplastic change where the normal stratified squamous epithelium is replaced by a more acid-resistant columnar epithelium with intestinal-type goblet cells. This metaplasia can progress to dysplasia and then adenocarcinoma. | Progression to adenocarcinoma involves stepwise acquisition of mutations: - Early: **TP53** and **CDKN2A** (p16) mutations. - Late: Amplification of oncogenes like **EGFR, ERBB2 (HER2), MET, cyclin D1**, and **cyclin E**. | Tongues of red, velvety mucosa extending upward from the gastroesophageal junction, alternating with pale squamous mucosa. | Replacement of squamous epithelium with metaplastic columnar epithelium containing **goblet cells**. These have distinct mucous vacuoles that stain pale blue and impart a "wine goblet" shape.  **Dysplasia** is characterized by atypical mitoses, nuclear hyperchromasia, increased N:C ratio, and architectural irregularities. | Symptoms are those of GERD (heartburn, dysphagia, regurgitation). It is often identified during endoscopy for GERD symptoms. | Diagnosis is made by endoscopy and biopsy showing intestinal metaplasia with goblet cells. | **Long segment** (≥3 cm) or **short segment** (<3 cm).  Graded by dysplasia: No dysplasia, low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia. | **Esophageal adenocarcinoma**. Risk is significantly increased, though most patients with Barrett's do not develop cancer. | Management of GERD (e.g., proton pump inhibitors).  Surveillance endoscopy with biopsy to monitor for dysplasia.  Treatment for dysplasia/carcinoma includes endoscopic resection, ablation, or esophagectomy. |
| **Carcinoid Syndrome** A syndrome caused by vasoactive substances secreted by some well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (carcinoids), particularly when they metastasize to the liver. | Secretion of vasoactive substances (e.g., serotonin, bradykinin, histamine) from a neuroendocrine tumor directly into the systemic circulation, bypassing hepatic "first-pass" metabolism. | Having a neuroendocrine tumor, especially a midgut (jejunum/ileum) tumor, with liver metastases. | 1. Neuroendocrine tumors (most often in the ileum) produce vasoactive peptides.  2. When confined to the intestine, these are metabolized by the liver (**first-pass effect**) and do not cause symptoms.  3. When the tumor metastasizes to the liver or other non-portal sites, the secreted substances bypass the liver and enter systemic circulation, causing systemic symptoms. | - | This is a clinical syndrome; the underlying tumor is a neuroendocrine neoplasm (carcinoid). Grossly, these are intramural or submucosal, firm, yellow-tan masses that can cause kinking/obstruction. | Tumor is composed of islands, trabeculae, or sheets of uniform cells with scant, pink granular cytoplasm and a round nucleus with "**salt and pepper**" chromatin.  Stains: Positive for **synaptophysin** and **chromogranin A**. | Cutaneous flushing, sweating, bronchospasm, colicky abdominal pain, diarrhea. | Elevated levels of serotonin metabolites, such as 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), in the urine. | - | **Right-sided cardiac valvular fibrosis** (pulmonic and tricuspid valve thickening and stenosis). Develops in about 10% of patients. Strongly associated with metastatic disease. | Treatment focuses on the underlying tumor. Somatostatin analogues can help control symptoms. |
| **Hirschsprung’s Disease** A congenital disorder causing functional obstruction of the colon due to failure of ganglion cells to migrate to the colonic wall. Also known as congenital aganglionic megacolon. | Results when the migration of neural crest cells from cecum to rectum is arrested prematurely, or when ganglion cells undergo premature death. This leads to an aganglionic segment. | Male gender. 10% of cases occur in children with Down syndrome. Familial cases occur. | 1. Neural crest cells fail to migrate completely to the distal colon during embryogenesis.  2. This creates a distal intestinal segment that lacks both the Meissner submucosal plexus and the Auerbach myenteric plexus (**aganglionosis**).  3. Coordinated peristaltic contractions are absent in this segment, leading to functional obstruction.  4. The normally innervated proximal colon undergoes progressive dilation (**megacolon**). | Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase **RET** account for the majority of familial and ~15% of sporadic cases.  Mutations in **EDNRB** or **EDN3** (receptor-ligand pair) also implicated.  Association with Down syndrome may be linked to the Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule gene on chromosome 21. | The affected aganglionic segment may appear grossly normal or contracted. Proximal to this, the colon is progressively dilated and may become massively distended (**megacolon**). The transition zone can be cone-shaped. | Diagnosis requires histologic confirmation of the **absence of ganglion cells** within the submucosal (Meissner's) and myenteric (Auerbach's) plexuses of the affected segment.  Special stain: Immunohistochemistry for **acetylcholinesterase** can highlight prominent nerve trunks in the lamina propria and submucosa. | Typically presents with a **failure to pass meconium** in the immediate postnatal period. Followed by obstruction, constipation, abdominal distention, and bilious vomiting. | Rectal biopsy demonstrating absence of ganglion cells is the gold standard. | **Short-segment** disease (limited to rectosigmoid).  **Long-segment** disease (more proximal extension, severe cases may involve the entire colon). | Enterocolitis, fluid and electrolyte disturbances, perforation, and peritonitis. These are major threats to life. Associated with other developmental anomalies (e.g., Down syndrome). | Surgical resection of the aganglionic segment and anastomosis of the normal proximal colon to the rectum. |
| **Amoebic Colitis (Amebiasis)** Infection of the colon by the protozoan Entamoeba histolytica. | Ingestion of cysts of **Entamoeba histolytica**. | Living in or travel to endemic areas (India, Mexico, Colombia). Fecal-oral transmission. | 1. Cysts survive gastric acid, then release ameboid trophozoites in the colon.  2. Trophozoites attach to colonic epithelium, induce apoptosis, invade crypts, and burrow laterally into the lamina propria.  3. This causes tissue damage and neutrophil recruitment, forming characteristic ulcers.  4. Trophozoites can penetrate splanchnic vessels and embolize to the liver. | - | Affects cecum and ascending colon most often. Dysentery develops when ulcers form. Liver abscesses can exceed 10cm, have a scant inflammatory reaction and shaggy fibrin lining. | Characteristic **flask-shaped ulcer** with a narrow neck and broad base. Trophozoites can be seen at the ulcer edge, which may be difficult to distinguish from macrophages. Some trophozoites may show ingested red blood cells. | Abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea (dysentery), or weight loss. Liver abscess presents with fever and right upper quadrant pain. | Identification of trophozoites or cysts in stool samples. Serology for liver abscess. | - | **Liver abscess** (in ~40% of patients with amebic dysentery). Rarely, necrotizing colitis, megacolon, or direct extension to lung/heart. | **Metronidazole** is effective for systemic disease. |
| **Cystic Fibrosis (GI Manifestations)** A genetic disorder affecting epithelial ion transport; GI manifestations are primarily due to pancreatic insufficiency. | Autosomal recessive mutations in the CFTR gene. | Having two mutated alleles of the CFTR gene. | 1. Absence of the **CFTR** epithelial ion channel causes defective chloride and bicarbonate transport.  2. In the pancreas, this leads to decreased hydration of ductal secretions, forming thick viscous fluid.  3. This causes formation of intraductal concretions, duct obstruction, low-grade chronic pancreatitis, and eventually **exocrine pancreatic insufficiency** (>80% of patients).  4. Lack of pancreatic enzymes (lipase, amylase, proteases) impairs intraluminal digestion, leading to malabsorption. | Mutations in the **Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR)** gene. | Pancreas becomes atrophic and fibrotic. Intestines may be obstructed by thick, viscous stool. | Pancreatic acinar atrophy and fibrosis with dilated ducts filled with eosinophilic concretions. | Malabsorption with **steatorrhea** (bulky, frothy, greasy stools), failure to thrive. Intestinal obstruction (meconium ileus in newborns). | Sweat chloride test. Genetic testing for CFTR mutations. Fecal elastase test for pancreatic insufficiency. | - | Intestinal obstruction, intussusception (in ~1% of patients). Malabsorption and deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins. | Oral pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. |
| **Celiac Disease** An immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by ingestion of gluten-containing foods in genetically predisposed individuals. Also known as celiac sprue or gluten-sensitive enteropathy. | Immune response to **gliadin**, a component of gluten. | Genetic predisposition (**HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8**). Female gender (in adults). | 1. Ingestion of gluten. Gliadin peptides are resistant to digestion.  2. Some gliadin peptides induce epithelial cells to express IL-15, which activates CD8+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), causing them to kill enterocytes.  3. Other gliadin peptides cross the damaged epithelium and are deamidated by **tissue transglutaminase (tTG)**.  4. Deamidated gliadin is presented by APCs (expressing HLA-DQ2/8) to CD4+ T cells.  5. Activated T cells produce cytokines that exacerbate tissue damage, leading to villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and IEL infiltration. B cells produce antibodies. | Almost all patients carry the class II HLA alleles **HLA-DQ2** or **HLA-DQ8**. | The mucosa of the duodenum or proximal jejunum may appear atrophic or scalloped on endoscopy. | Triad of histologic features:  1. **Intraepithelial lymphocytosis** (increased CD8+ T lymphocytes).  2. **Crypt hyperplasia**.  3. **Villous atrophy** (blunting or total loss of villi).  Increased numbers of plasma cells, mast cells, and eosinophils in the lamina propria. | **Adults:** Presents ages 30-60. Chronic diarrhea, bloating, fatigue, or asymptomatic with anemia.  **Children:** Irritability, abdominal distention, failure to thrive, chronic diarrhea, weight loss.  A characteristic skin lesion, **dermatitis herpetiformis**, can be present. | Serology is the most sensitive test:  - IgA antibodies against **tissue transglutaminase (tTG)**.  - IgA anti-endomysial antibodies.  - IgG anti-tTG antibodies (in IgA deficiency).  Absence of HLA-DQ2/8 has a high negative predictive value. | **Silent celiac disease:** Positive serology and villous atrophy without symptoms. **Latent celiac disease:** Positive serology without villous atrophy. | Increased risk of malignancy, most commonly **enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma** and small intestinal adenocarcinoma. Anemia, female infertility, osteoporosis. | Strict gluten-free diet. |
| **Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP)** An autosomal dominant disorder where patients develop numerous colorectal adenomas as teenagers. | Somatic mutations of the APC gene. ~75% inherited, 25% de novo. | Having a germline mutation in the APC gene. | Germline mutation in one **APC** allele (first hit). Somatic loss of the second normal allele (second hit) in a colonocyte leads to loss of APC function. This results in hyperactivation of the **Wnt signaling pathway**, causing uncontrolled proliferation and adenoma formation. Over time, these adenomas accumulate more mutations and progress to carcinoma. | Germline mutations in the **Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC)** gene, a key negative regulator of the Wnt pathway. | The colon is carpeted with hundreds to thousands of polyps. At least 100 are required for diagnosis. Polyps are morphologically indistinguishable from sporadic adenomas. | Polyps are tubular or tubulovillous adenomas, characterized by epithelial dysplasia (nuclear hyperchromasia, elongation, stratification). Microscopic adenomas (one or two dysplastic crypts) are common. | Patients develop adenomas as teenagers. Often asymptomatic until cancer develops. | Genetic testing for APC mutations. Endoscopic identification of >100 polyps. | **Classic FAP**  **Attenuated FAP** (fewer polyps, later cancer onset).  **Gardner syndrome** (FAP + osteomas, desmoid tumors, skin cysts).  **Turcot syndrome** (FAP + medulloblastoma). | **Colorectal adenocarcinoma develops in 100% of untreated patients**, often before age 30.  Extracolonic neoplasms: Adenomas of the stomach and ampulla of Vater.  Congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE). | Prophylactic colectomy is the standard of care to prevent colorectal cancer. Surveillance for upper GI neoplasms. |
| **Juvenile Polyps** Focal hamartomatous malformations of the epithelium and lamina propria. | Can be sporadic or part of autosomal dominant syndromes caused by mutations in growth-regulating pathways. | Mostly occur in children < 5 years old. Familial predisposition in syndromic cases. | Proposed to be initiated by mucosal hyperplasia. Mutations in genes of the TGF-β pathway, which normally inhibit growth, lead to focal hamartomatous overgrowth of lamina propria and epithelium. | Autosomal dominant Juvenile Polyposis syndrome is caused by mutations in:  - **SMAD4** (a signaling intermediate in the TGF-β pathway).  - **BMPR1A** (a kinase in the TGF-β superfamily). | Typically pedunculated, smooth-surfaced, reddish lesions < 3 cm in diameter, often with cystic spaces. Usually located in the rectum. | Cystically dilated glands filled with mucin and inflammatory debris. Lamina propria is expanded by a mixed inflammatory infiltrate. | Rectal bleeding is the most common symptom. May cause intussusception or polyp prolapse. | - | **Sporadic (retention) polyps:** Solitary. **Juvenile Polyposis Syndrome:** Autosomal dominant, 3 to hundreds of polyps. | **Dysplasia is rare in sporadic polyps**.  **Juvenile Polyposis Syndrome is associated with dysplasia and an increased risk of colonic adenocarcinoma** (30-50% of patients develop it by age 45).  Associated with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. | Polypectomy. In syndromic cases, colectomy may be necessary to limit hemorrhage or cancer risk. |
| **Neoplastic Polyps of Large Intestine (Adenomas)** Benign epithelial neoplasms that are precursors to the majority of colorectal adenocarcinomas. Their hallmark is epithelial dysplasia. | Arise from mutations in genes controlling cell growth and differentiation, most commonly initiating with loss of the APC tumor suppressor gene. | Age (30% of adults by age 60 in Western world). Dietary factors. Familial syndromes. | See **Adenoma-Carcinoma Sequence** under Colorectal Cancer. Begins as a sessile lesion; traction and growth can lead to formation of a stalk (pedunculated). | Loss of **APC**. Mutations in **KRAS**, **TP53**. (See Colorectal Cancer) | Can be small and pedunculated or large and sessile. Surface texture resembles velvet or a raspberry. Range from 0.3 to 10 cm. | Hallmark is **epithelial dysplasia**: nuclear hyperchromasia, elongation, and stratification, with reduced goblet cells. Architecture can be tubular (rounded glands), villous (slender projections), or mixed.  **Sessile Serrated Adenoma (Lesion)** lacks typical cytologic dysplasia but has serrated architecture to the crypt base and lateral crypt growth. | Most are clinically silent. Large polyps can cause occult bleeding and anemia. | Identified by colonoscopy. | **By architecture:** - Tubular adenoma - Villous adenoma - Tubulovillous adenoma **Separate category:** - Sessile serrated adenoma/lesion | Risk of progressing to **invasive adenocarcinoma**. Risk correlates strongly with size (>4cm polyps have ~40% risk of cancer) and histologic type (villous architecture has higher risk). | Polypectomy via colonoscopy. Surveillance colonoscopy to detect new polyps. |
| **Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome** A rare autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by multiple GI hamartomatous polyps and mucocutaneous hyperpigmentation. | Germline heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the STK11 tumor suppressor gene. | Having a germline STK11 mutation. | Loss of the STK11 tumor suppressor gene, which regulates cell polarization and acts as a brake on growth via AMP-activated protein kinases (AMPK), leads to formation of hamartomatous polyps. Somatic loss of the second STK11 copy in these polyps can lead to cancer. | Germline heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene **STK11** (LKB1). | Large, pedunculated polyps with a lobulated contour. Most common in the small intestine, but can occur in stomach and colon. | Characteristic **arborizing network of connective tissue and smooth muscle** lined by normal-appearing intestinal epithelium. This smooth muscle core distinguishes it from juvenile polyps. | Presents at a median age of 11.  Characteristic mucocutaneous hyperpigmentation: dark blue to brown macules on lips, nostrils, buccal mucosa, hands, genitalia. | Diagnosis based on clinical triad of polyps, pigmentation, and family history. STK11 mutation detection can be helpful. | - | Intussusception.  **Markedly increased risk of several malignancies** (lifetime risk ~40%), including colon, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, breast, lung, ovarian, uterine, and sex cord tumors of the testes. | Polypectomy and regular surveillance for associated cancers. |
| **Whipple's Disease** A rare, multisystem chronic disease caused by the bacterium Tropheryma whipplei, characterized by malabsorption due to lymphatic obstruction. | Infection with the gram-positive actinomycete **Tropheryma whipplei**. | Most common in Caucasian men, particularly farmers and others with occupational exposure to soil or animals. Genetic risk factors are suggested due to rarity of disease despite large number of carriers. | 1. Ingested bacteria are phagocytosed by macrophages.  2. Bacteria-laden macrophages accumulate within the small intestinal lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodes.  3. This massive infiltration causes lymphatic obstruction.  4. The malabsorptive diarrhea is thus due to **impaired lymph drainage** of absorbed lipids. | - | Shaggy gross appearance to the mucosal surface due to villous expansion. White to yellow mucosal plaques may be visible endoscopically due to lymphatic dilation and lipid deposition. | Morphologic hallmark is a dense accumulation of distended, **foamy macrophages** in the small intestinal lamina propria.  **Special Stains:** Macrophages contain granules that are **PAS-positive** and diastase-resistant. These represent partially digested bacteria. Acid-fast stain is negative (unlike mycobacterial infection). Intact rod-shaped bacilli can be seen on electron microscopy. | Classic triad of diarrhea, weight loss, and arthralgia. Extraintestinal symptoms (arthritis, fever, lymphadenopathy, neurologic, cardiac, pulmonary disease) may precede malabsorption by years. | Duodenal biopsy is diagnostic. PCR for T. whipplei can confirm the diagnosis. | - | Malabsorption. Involvement of CNS, heart (endocarditis), joints (arthritis). | Long-term antibiotic therapy. |
| **Ménétrier Disease** A rare hypertrophic gastropathy associated with excessive secretion of TGF-α, characterized by giant rugal folds and protein-losing enteropathy. | Excessive secretion of transforming growth factor (TGF)-α, leading to hyperactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Some cases are associated with viral (CMV) or H. pylori infection. | Presents at age 30-60. Pediatric cases are usually self-limited and follow infection. | Overproduction of **TGF-α** binds to and hyperactivates its receptor, **EGFR**, on gastric epithelial cells. This drives massive hyperplasia of the foveolar (mucus-secreting) epithelium, leading to giant rugal folds. It also causes a protein-losing enteropathy across the gastric mucosa. | - | Irregular, giant "**cerebriform**" enlargement of the rugal folds, primarily in the body and fundus. The antrum is generally spared. | Hyperplasia of foveolar mucous cells. Glands are elongated with a **corkscrew-like appearance** and cystic dilation is common. Diffuse or patchy glandular atrophy (loss of parietal and chief cells) is also present. Inflammation is usually modest. | Hypoproteinemia (due to albumin loss), weight loss, diarrhea, peripheral edema. | - | - | Increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma in adults. | Supportive care (IV albumin). Antibodies that block EGFR activation (e.g., cetuximab) are effective. In severe cases, gastrectomy. |
| **Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome** Syndrome caused by gastrin-secreting neuroendocrine tumors (gastrinomas), leading to massive acid hypersecretion and severe peptic ulcer disease. | Gastrin-secreting neuroendocrine tumors (**gastrinomas**), almost always located in the small intestine or pancreas. | About 25% of patients have multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). | 1. A gastrinoma autonomously secretes large amounts of gastrin.  2. High gastrin levels cause massive hyperplasia of gastric parietal cells.  3. This leads to extreme gastric acid hypersecretion.  4. The excess acid overwhelms protective mechanisms, causing severe peptic ulcers, often in unusual locations (e.g., jejunum), and chronic diarrhea (due to pancreatic enzyme inactivation). | **MEN1** gene mutations are found in syndromic cases and are associated with aggressive behavior in sporadic tumors. | Marked increase in thickness of the oxyntic (acid-producing) mucosa. Multiple peptic ulcers may be present. The gastrinoma itself is often small and difficult to locate. | Massive parietal cell hyperplasia. Hyperplasia of mucous neck and endocrine cells within the oxyntic mucosa. | Duodenal ulcers or chronic diarrhea. Abdominal pain. | Markedly elevated serum gastrin levels. Gastric acid secretion studies. Imaging (somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, endoscopic ultrasound) to locate the tumor. | **Sporadic gastrinomas:** Solitary lesions (75%).  **MEN1-associated gastrinomas:** Multiple, younger age, often duodenal tumors that metastasize (25%). | Severe, recurrent peptic ulcer disease. Metastasis of the gastrinoma (60-90% are malignant). Associated with MEN1 syndrome (parathyroid, pituitary tumors). | Blockade of acid hypersecretion with high-dose proton pump inhibitors. Surgical resection of the gastrinoma if possible. Somatostatin analogues for metastatic disease. |
| **Infectious Enterocolitis (Cholera)** An acute diarrheal illness caused by Vibrio cholerae. | Infection with toxigenic strains of **Vibrio cholerae**, a comma-shaped, gram-negative bacterium. | Drinking contaminated water or eating contaminated food (especially shellfish). Poor sanitation, war, natural disasters. | 1. V. cholerae colonizes the small intestine but remains non-invasive.  2. It secretes **cholera toxin** (encoded by a phage).  3. The toxin's B subunits bind to GM1 ganglioside on enterocytes, allowing the A subunit to enter the cell.  4. The A subunit ADP-ribosylates and permanently activates the Gαs protein.  5. This leads to constitutive activation of adenylate cyclase, increasing intracellular **cAMP**.  6. High cAMP opens the CFTR chloride channel, causing massive secretion of chloride, sodium, and water into the lumen, resulting in secretory diarrhea. | - | - | Remarkably, mucosal biopsies show only minimal histologic alterations despite massive diarrhea. There is no significant inflammation or mucosal destruction. | Abrupt onset of voluminous, watery, non-bloody diarrhea. Stools resemble "**rice water**" and may have a fishy odor. Vomiting is also common. No fever. | Stool culture. | - | Severe dehydration, hypotension, muscular cramping, anuria, shock, and death (mortality is ~50% without treatment). | Prompt oral or intravenous fluid and electrolyte replacement. Antibiotics can shorten the duration but are secondary to rehydration. |
| **Hemorrhoids** Dilated veins of the hemorrhoidal plexus. | Persistently elevated venous pressure within the hemorrhoidal plexus. | Straining at defecation (constipation), venous stasis of pregnancy, portal hypertension (cirrhosis). Rarely seen in people < 30 years old (except pregnant women). | Elevated intra-abdominal pressure (straining, pregnancy) or back-pressure from portal hypertension impedes venous return from the hemorrhoidal plexuses, leading to their dilation and formation of varices. | - | Thin-walled, dilated, submucosal vessels in the anal canal. Can be internal or external. May thrombose. | Dilated vascular channels. Can have associated thrombus, inflammation, or ulceration. | Pain and rectal bleeding, particularly bright red blood seen on toilet tissue. Itching. | Clinical diagnosis (inspection, anoscopy). | **Internal** hemorrhoids (above the dentate line). **External** hemorrhoids (below the dentate line). | Bleeding, thrombosis, ulceration, strangulation. Usually not a medical emergency. | Dietary modification (high fiber), sclerotherapy, rubber band ligation, infrared coagulation. Surgical hemorrhoidectomy for severe cases. |
| **Pseudomembranous Colitis** An inflammatory condition of the colon, generally caused by C. difficile, characterized by the formation of pseudomembranes. Also called antibiotic-associated colitis. | Overgrowth of toxigenic **Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile**, typically after disruption of normal colonic microbiota by antibiotics. | Antibiotic treatment, advanced age, hospitalization, immunosuppression. | 1. Antibiotics disrupt the normal gut flora, allowing C. difficile to overgrow.  2. C. difficile releases exotoxins (Toxin A and Toxin B).  3. Toxins cause ribosylation of Rho GTPases, leading to disruption of the epithelial cytoskeleton, tight junction barrier loss, and apoptosis.  4. This causes an intense inflammatory response, with neutrophils erupting from damaged crypts to form the characteristic pseudomembrane. | - | The colon is coated by tan-colored pseudomembranes, which are made up of an adherent layer of inflammatory cells and debris. | Histopathology is **pathognomonic**. Mucopurulent exudate characteristically erupts from damaged crypts to form "**volcano**" lesions. These mushroom-shaped exudates of neutrophils, mucus, and fibrin coalesce to form the pseudomembrane on the mucosal surface. The underlying epithelium is denuded. | Fever, leukocytosis, abdominal pain, cramps, watery diarrhea. Fecal leukocytes may be present. Grossly bloody diarrhea is uncommon. | Detection of C. difficile toxin (or its gene) in the stool. | - | Hypoalbuminemia, dehydration. Recurrent C. difficile infection (up to 40% of patients).  **Toxic megacolon** is a potentially fatal complication. | Oral metronidazole or vancomycin. Fecal microbial transplantation for recurrent disease. New antibiotics and monoclonal antibodies against toxins are also effective. |
| **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)** A functional bowel disorder characterized by chronic, relapsing abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits, without any organic cause. | Pathogenesis is poorly defined. Involves an interplay of psychological stressors, diet, gut microbiome perturbation, increased enteric sensory response (visceral hypersensitivity), and abnormal GI motility. | Peak prevalence between 20-40 years of age. Significant female predominance. Post-infectious onset in some cases. | Mechanisms are unclear but involve:  - **Abnormal motility:** Decreased or increased colonic transit times.  - **Visceral hypersensitivity:** Lower pain threshold to gut stimuli like distention.  - **Brain-Gut Axis Dysfunction:** Disturbed signaling between enteric and central nervous systems.  - **Microbiome changes:** Altered gut flora composition.  - **Immune activation:** Low-grade inflammation or immune activation, especially in post-infectious IBS. | Candidate genes have been linked, including serotonin reuptake transporters, cannabinoid receptors, and TNF-related inflammatory mediators. | Normal. | Normal. Diagnosis of exclusion. | Chronic, relapsing abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, altered bowel habits (diarrhea, constipation, or alternating). Pain often improves with defecation.  Diagnosis based on clinical criteria (e.g., **Rome criteria**: abdominal pain at least 3 days/month for 3 months, with changes in stool form/frequency). | - | **IBS with constipation (IBS-C)** **IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D)** **Mixed IBS (IBS-M)** | Associated with psychological distress. Does not lead to structural damage or increase risk of other diseases like cancer. | Symptomatic management. Dietary changes (e.g., low FODMAP diet). Medications for diarrhea (loperamide, 5-HT3 antagonists) or constipation. Psychoactive drugs with anti-cholinergic effects. |
