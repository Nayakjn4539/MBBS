# [[Throat Surgery]] > Tracheostomy and procedures for airway management

### Definition
*   **Tracheotomy:** The surgical act of making an opening into the trachea.
*   **[[Tracheostomy]]:** The creation of a stoma at the skin surface that leads into the tracheal lumen. It creates an alternative pathway for breathing, bypassing the upper airway.

### Functions of Tracheostomy
1.  **Bypass Obstruction:** Circumvents upper airway obstruction (from lips to the tracheostome).
2.  **Improve Alveolar Ventilation:**
    *   Decreases **[[Dead Space]]** by 30–50% (normal is 150 mL).
    *   Reduces airway resistance, decreasing the work of breathing.
3.  **Protect the Airway:** A cuffed tube protects the tracheobronchial tree against aspiration of blood (e.g., maxillofacial trauma) or pharyngeal secretions (e.g., bulbar paralysis).
4.  **Removal of Secretions:** Facilitates tracheobronchial toilet (suctioning) in patients unable to cough effectively (e.g., coma, chest injuries, tetanus).
5.  **Intermittent Positive Pressure Respiration (IPPR):** Superior to endotracheal intubation if ventilation is required beyond 72 hours to 10–14 days.
6.  **Anaesthesia Administration:** Used when endotracheal intubation is impossible (e.g., trismus, laryngopharyngeal growths).

*(Obstruction, Mechanical ventilation, Secretion removal, Maxillofacial surgeries, Aspiration prevention)*

| Category | Specific Conditions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Respiratory Obstruction** | • **Infections:** [[Ludwig's angina]], [[Acute epiglottitis]], [[Laryngotracheobronchitis]], Diphtheria.<br>• **Trauma:** Maxillofacial injuries, laryngeal injury.<br>• **Tumors:** Carcinoma of larynx/pharynx/thyroid.<br>• **Foreign Body:** Impacted in larynx.<br>• **Vocal Cord Palsy:** Bilateral abductor palsy.<br>• **Others:** Angioneurotic edema, laryngeal stenosis. |
| **Retained Secretions** | • **Inability to cough:** Coma, head injury, cerebrovascular stroke.<br>• **Painful cough:** Chest injuries, multiple rib fractures.<br>• **Spasm of respiratory muscles:** Tetanus, eclampsia. |
| **Respiratory Insufficiency** | • **Prolonged Mechanical Ventilation:** Guillain-Barre syndrome, Myasthenia gravis, Polio, COPD exacerbation. |
| **Prophylactic/Elective** | • Major head and neck surgeries (e.g., commando operation) to secure airway and prevent aspiration. |

### Types of Tracheostomy
1.  **Emergency Tracheostomy:** Performed when airway obstruction is complete/near-complete and intubation fails. Vertical incision is preferred.
2.  **Elective (Therapeutic/Prophylactic):** Planned procedure with full surgical facilities. Transverse incision often used.
3.  **Permanent Tracheostomy:** Lower tracheal stump stitched to skin following [[Laryngectomy]].
4.  **Percutaneous Dilational Tracheostomy (PDT):** Bedside procedure in ICU using Seldinger technique.
5.  **Minitracheostomy ([[Cricothyrotomy]]):** Opening through cricothyroid membrane.

**Classification by Level:**
*   **High:** Above thyroid isthmus (1st tracheal ring). *Avoided* due to risk of perichondritis and subglottic stenosis (except in Ca Larynx).
*   **Mid:** Through 2nd, 3rd, or 4th rings (behind thyroid isthmus). **Preferred site**.
*   **Low:** Below thyroid isthmus. Dangerous due to large vessels; tube may impinge on suprasternal notch.

### Surgical Procedure (Standard Adult)
**Anaesthesia:** General (preferred) or Local (1% lignocaine with adrenaline).

**Positioning:**
*   **[[Rose Position]]:** Patient supine with sandbag under shoulders.
*   Neck extended at cervicothoracic joint and head extended at atlanto-occipital joint to bring trachea forward.
*   *Note:* Too much extension in children may pull thoracic structures (pleura, innominate artery) into the neck.

**Steps:**
1.  **Incision:**
    *   **Vertical:** Midline from cricoid to suprasternal notch. Better for emergencies; less bleeding.
    *   **Transverse:** 2 fingers breadth above sternal notch (midpoint between cricoid and sternal notch). Better cosmetic scar.
2.  **Dissection:** Divide deep fascia. Separate strap muscles ([[Sternohyoid]] and [[Sternothyroid]]) in the midline and retract laterally.
3.  **Thyroid Isthmus:** Identify isthmus (overlies 2nd–4th rings). Retract it upwards/downwards or clamp, divide, and suture ligate.
4.  **Tracheal Opening:**
    *   Secure cricoid with a **cricoid hook** to stabilize trachea.
    *   Inject few drops of 4% lignocaine into tracheal lumen to suppress cough reflex.
    *   **Incision:** Vertical incision in **2nd and 3rd** or **3rd and 4th** rings.
    *   **Bjork Flap:** An inferiorly based U-shaped flap of anterior tracheal wall sutured to the skin. Advantages: Prevents tube displacement, easier tube change, eliminates dead space.
    *   *Note:* Avoid the 1st ring to prevent subglottic stenosis.
5.  **Insertion:** Insert appropriate size cuffed tube (e.g., Portex). Inflate cuff.
6.  **Fixation:** Secure with tapes around neck (flex neck while tying to avoid looseness later). Do not suture skin tightly to prevent surgical emphysema.

### Paediatric Tracheostomy
*Anatomical Differences:* Neck is short, trachea soft/compressible, domes of pleura higher.
*   **Anaesthesia:** General endotracheal anaesthesia is mandatory.
*   **Incision:** Vertical skin incision preferred.
*   **Tracheal Opening:** Vertical slit only (rings 2-4). **No cartilage is removed**.
*   **Stay Sutures:** Lateral stay sutures (silk/polypropylene) placed on tracheal walls and taped to chest. Lifesaving for re-opening trachea if accidental decannulation occurs.
*   **Maturation Sutures:** Tracheal edge sutured to skin edge to facilitate healing and tube changes.
*   **Tube:** Usually uncuffed tubes used.

### Percutaneous Dilational Tracheostomy (PDT)
*   **Technique:** Seldinger technique (needle $\rightarrow$ guidewire $\rightarrow$ dilators $\rightarrow$ tube).
*   **Guidance:** Ideally done under fibre-optic bronchoscopic guidance.
*   **Advantages:** Bedside procedure (ICU), less dissection, smaller wound.
*   **Contraindications:** Children <12 years, obscure anatomy (obese/short neck), emergency airway need, coagulopathy.

### Cricothyrotomy (Minitracheostomy)
*   **Site:** [[Cricothyroid membrane]] (between thyroid and cricoid cartilages).
*   **Indication:** Dire emergency ("Can't intubate, Can't ventilate").
*   **Procedure:** Stab incision through membrane, insert small tube (or whatever is available).
*   **Risk:** Subglottic stenosis if left long-term. Convert to formal tracheostomy ASAP.

### Tracheostomy Tubes
**Materials:**
1.  **Metallic:**
    *   **Jackson's:** Outer tube, Inner tube, Obturator. Used for permanent stoma. Silver.
    *   **Fuller's:** Bivalved outer tube (easier insertion). Inner tube for cleaning.
2.  **Synthetic (PVC/Silicone):** e.g., Portex. Thermolabile (molds to anatomy), disposable..

**Features:**
*   **Cuffed:** Prevents aspiration, allows positive pressure ventilation. Cuff should be low pressure, high volume.
*   **Uncuffed:** For children or when aspiration risk is gone.
*   **Fenestrated:** Hole in curvature allows air to pass to vocal cords for phonation when tube is plugged.

### Post-Operative Care
*   **Suctioning:** Sterile, regular, using Y-connector. Apply suction only on withdrawal.
*   **Humidification:** Essential to prevent crusting/blockage (loss of nasal function).
*   **Cuff Care:** Deflate periodically (every 2 hours for 5 mins) to prevent tracheal necrosis/stenosis.
*   **Tube Change:** First change after 3–4 days (track formation). Metal tubes inner cannula cleaned daily.

### Decannulation (Removal)
*   **Prerequisites:** Cause resolved, patient can cough/swallow, no aspiration.
*   **Procedure:** Downsize tube $\rightarrow$ Block tube (spigot) for 24 hours $\rightarrow$ If tolerated, remove tube $\rightarrow$ Tape wound (heals in 1 week).
*   **Difficult Decannulation (Children):** Due to granulations, subglottic stenosis, tracheomalacia, or psychological dependence.

### Complications
**Mnemonic:** **HARP** (Hemorrhage, Apnea, Recurrent nerve damage, Pneumothorax)

| Timing | Complication | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Immediate** (Operative) | **Hemorrhage** | Commonest. Injury to anterior jugular v., thyroid isthmus, or thyroidea ima artery. |

| | **Subcutaneous Emphysema** | Tightly sutured skin or tube blockage. |
| | **Infection** | Tracheitis, wound infection. |
| **Late** (Weeks/Months) | **Stenosis** | Laryngeal (if high tracheostomy) or Tracheal (cuff pressure/granulations). |
| | **Fistula** | Tracheo-esophageal (TEF) or Tracheo-cutaneous. |
| | **Granulations** | At stoma site or tip of tube. |
