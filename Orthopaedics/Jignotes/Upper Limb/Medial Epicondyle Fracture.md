# [[Upper Limb]] > Medial Epicondyle Fracture

### Medial Epicondyle Fracture

**Overview**
A [[medial epicondyle fracture]] is typically an [[avulsion fracture]] occurring at the distal humerus. It is significantly more common in children and adolescents than in adults. The [[medial epicondyle]] serves as the origin for the [[common flexor tendon]] and the attachment site for the [[ulnar collateral ligament]].

### Mechanism of Injury
These fractures are almost exclusively avulsion injuries caused by the intense traction of the flexor-pronator muscle mass or the [[medial collateral ligament]].

1.  **Fall on an Outstretched Hand (FOOSH):** With the [[elbow]] extended and [[forearm]] supinated, creating a severe valgus stress.
2.  **Elbow Dislocation:** Approximately 50% of medial epicondyle fractures are associated with a posterior [[elbow dislocation]]. As the elbow dislocates, the tension strips the epicondyle off.
3.  **Direct Trauma:** Rare (e.g., direct blow).
4.  **Chronic Stress:** "Little Leaguer’s Elbow" in throwers causing stress fractures/apophysitis.

### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Pain over the medial aspect of the elbow.
    *   Swelling and bruising (ecchymosis) over the medial side.
*   **Signs:**
    *   Localized tenderness over the [[medial epicondyle]].
    *   Pain exacerbated by passive wrist/finger extension or active wrist flexion against resistance.
    *   **Elbow Instability:** Valgus stress test may reveal laxity.
*   **Neurological Assessment:**
    *   The [[ulnar nerve]] runs in the groove behind the medial epicondyle.
    *   Check for **Ulnar Nerve Palsy:** Numbness in the little finger/ring finger and weakness of intrinsic hand muscles.

### Diagnostic Imaging
**X-rays:**
*   **Views:** Anteroposterior (AP) and Lateral.
*   **Findings:** The fracture line may be visible, or the epicondyle may be displaced distally.
*   **The Trap (Incarceration):** In children, a displaced medial epicondyle fragment can become trapped *inside* the [[elbow joint]] following a dislocation that spontaneously reduced. It can be mistaken for the [[trochlea]].

**Clinical Implication: CRITOE Mnemonic**
To identify if a bone fragment inside the joint is the medial epicondyle, remember the order of appearance of ossification centers:
*   **C** - [[Capitulum]] (1-2 years)
*   **R** - [[Radial head]] (3-4 years)
*   **I** - **[[Internal (Medial) Epicondyle]]** (5-6 years)
*   **T** - [[Trochlea]] (7-8 years)
*   **O** - [[Olecranon]] (9-10 years)
*   **E** - [[External (Lateral) Epicondyle]] (11-12 years)

*Note:* If you see the **T**rochlea but *not* the **I**nternal epicondyle in its place, the epicondyle is likely trapped inside the joint.

### Classification (Based on Displacement)

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Undisplaced** | Fracture line visible, fragment in anatomical position. |
| **Minimally Displaced** | Minor separation of the fragment. |
| **Severely Displaced** | Fragment displaced significantly, often distally. |
| **Incarcerated** | Fragment trapped within the [[joint capsule]] (intra-articular). |

### Management

#### 1. Conservative Management
*   **Indications:** Undisplaced fractures or minimally displaced fractures (< 5mm displacement) with no instability.
*   **Method:**
    *   Immobilization in an **Above Elbow Cast/Slab**.
    *   Position: Elbow flexed to 90° and forearm pronated (to relax the flexor-pronator mass).
    *   Duration: 3–4 weeks, followed by gentle range of motion exercises.

#### 2. Operative Management
*   **Indications:**
    *   Displacement > 5mm (controversial, some surgeons operate at >2mm in high-demand athletes).
    *   **Incarcerated fragment** (Absolute indication).
    *   [[Ulnar nerve]] dysfunction/entrapment.
    *   Valgus instability (indicating disruption of the [[ulnar collateral ligament]]).
    *   High-demand athletes (e.g., gymnasts, throwers).
*   **Techniques:**
    *   **Closed Reduction:** Manipulation to extract trapped fragment (valgus stress + supination + wrist extension), followed by fixation.
    *   **Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF):**
        *   Fixation using **[[K-wires]]** (in children/skeletally immature).
        *   Fixation using **[[Cannulated Screws]]** (in adolescents/adults).
    *   **Excision:** In adults with comminuted fractures or symptomatic non-union, the fragment may be excised, and the flexor mass sutured to the fascial tissues.

### Complications

*   **[[Ulnar Nerve Neuropathy]]:** Can occur acutely from trauma or iatrogenically during surgery. Late palsy can occur due to friction or non-union.
*   **Joint Stiffness:** Loss of terminal extension is common (flexion contracture).
*   **Non-union:** High rate of fibrous union, but often asymptomatic.
*   **Myositis Ossificans:** Heterotopic ossification around the elbow due to vigorous massage or passive stretching.
*   **Valgus Instability:** If the [[ulnar collateral ligament]] complex integrity is not restored.
