# Influenza (Seasonal and Pandemic)

### Problem Statement
Influenza is an acute respiratory tract infection caused by the **Influenza virus**. It is a major public health concern due to its ability to cause unpredictable epidemics and global [[Pandemics]]. While seasonal influenza causes significant morbidity annually, novel strains can lead to devastating pandemics (e.g., [[Spanish Flu]] 1918, [[H1N1 Swine Flu]] 2009).

### Epidemiological Determinants

#### 1. Agent Factors
*   **Agent:** RNA virus of family *Orthomyxoviridae*.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Type A:** Causes widespread **epidemics and pandemics**. It is the most virulent and mutates rapidly.
    *   **Type B:** Causes regional epidemics; generally less severe than Type A.
    *   **Type C:** Causes sporadic, mild cases.
*   **Surface Antigens:** The virus is identified by two surface glycoproteins:
    1.  **H (Hemagglutinin):** Helps the virus *attach* and enter the host cell (18 subtypes).
    2.  **N (Neuraminidase):** Helps the virus *release* from the host cell to infect others (11 subtypes).
*   **Antigenic Variation:** This is the hallmark of Influenza A.
    *   **[[Antigenic Drift]]:** Minor/gradual changes (point mutations) in H or N antigens. This causes **Seasonal Epidemics** because population immunity wanes.
    *   **[[Antigenic Shift]]:** Major/sudden change (genetic reassortment) resulting in a completely new subtype. This occurs when a host (usually a pig) is coinfected with human and animal viruses. This causes **Pandemics**.

> **Mnemonic for Antigenic Variation:**
> *   **Drift** = **D**rifting slowly (minor change, Epidemic).
> *   **Shift** = **S**udden **S**hift (major change, Pandemic).

*   **Resistance:** The virus is killed by heat (56°C for 30 min), sunlight, and disinfectants (chlorine, soap). It survives well in cold, dry environments.

#### 2. Host Factors
*   **Host:** Humans are the primary reservoir for human strains.
*   **Animal Reservoirs:** Birds (ducks/poultry) are the natural reservoir for Type A. Pigs act as **"Mixing Vessels"** where human and avian viruses can mix to create new pandemic strains.
*   **Age:** Affects all ages. Highest attack rate in children (5–9 years), but highest mortality in the elderly (>65 years) and infants.
*   **High-Risk Groups:** Pregnant women, elderly, children <2 years, individuals with chronic comorbidities (COPD, Diabetes, Cardiac disease), and immunosuppressed patients.
*   **Immunity:** Immunity is subtype-specific and short-lived (6–12 months) due to antigenic drift.

#### 3. Environmental Factors
*   **Seasonality:** In temperate zones, it peaks in winter. In tropical zones (like India), it often peaks during the rainy season.
*   **Overcrowding:** Schools, transport, and institutions facilitate rapid spread.

### Transmission Dynamics
*   **Mode of Transmission:**
    1.  **Droplet Infection:** Coughing, sneezing, talking (primary mode).
    2.  **Droplet Nuclei:** Aerosols suspended in air.
    3.  **Direct Contact:** Touching contaminated surfaces (fomites) and then touching the face.
*   **Incubation Period:** **18 to 72 hours** (Short).
*   **Period of Communicability:**
    *   **1–2 days before** onset of symptoms.
    *   **1–2 days after** onset of symptoms (can last up to 5–7 days in adults and longer in children).

---

### Clinical Picture
*   **Onset:** Abrupt/Sudden.
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   High fever (up to 40°C), chills/rigors.
    *   Severe **Myalgia** (muscle pain) and body aches.
    *   Headache (often severe).
    *   Dry cough and sore throat.
    *   General malaise and exhaustion.
*   **Complications:**
    *   **Pneumonia:** Can be primary viral pneumonia (rapid, severe) or secondary bacterial pneumonia (commonly *S. pneumoniae* or *S. aureus*).
    *   **Reye’s Syndrome:** Associated with **Aspirin** use in children with viral fever (fatty liver + encephalopathy).
    *   **Worsening of chronic conditions:** Exacerbation of Asthma, COPD, or CHF.

> **Clinical Relevance:** Never prescribe Aspirin to children or teenagers with flu-like symptoms due to the risk of [[Reye's Syndrome]]. Use Paracetamol instead.

### Diagnosis
1.  **Clinical:** Based on definition of **ILI (Influenza-Like Illness)**: Acute onset of fever >38°C + Cough/Sore throat.
2.  **Laboratory (Gold Standard):** **RT-PCR** ([[Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction]]) from nasopharyngeal or throat swabs.
3.  **Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT):** Antigen detection (lower sensitivity).
4.  **Viral Isolation:** Chick embryo or tissue culture (mostly for research/vaccine prep).

---

### Treatment
*   **Uncomplicated Cases:** Symptomatic treatment (hydration, rest, antipyretics). **Antibiotics are NOT effective** against viruses and should only be used if bacterial complications arise.
*   **Antiviral Therapy:** Recommended for severe cases, hospitalized patients, and high-risk groups. Ideally started within 48 hours.
    *   **Neuraminidase Inhibitors:**
        *   **[[Oseltamivir]] (Tamiflu):** Oral drug. Adult dose: **75 mg BD for 5 days**.
        *   **Zanamivir:** Inhaled powder.
*   **Amantadine/Rimantadine:** Older drugs, mostly resistant now; not recommended.

### Prevention and Control

#### 1. Vaccination (Immunoprophylaxis)
Influenza vaccines are updated annually based on WHO surveillance of circulating strains.
*   **Types of Vaccines:**
    | Feature | **Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (IIV)** | **Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV)** |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | **Route** | Intramuscular (Deltoid) | Intranasal Spray |
    | **Type** | Killed virus (Safe) | Live virus (Replicates in nose) |
    | **Target** | All >6 months (including high risk/pregnant) | Healthy non-pregnant persons (2–49 years) |
    | **Safety** | Rarely causes GBS; Safe in pregnancy | Contraindicated in pregnancy/immunocompromised |

*   **Composition:** Usually **Quadrivalent** (2 Type A strains + 2 Type B strains) or Trivalent.
*   **Contraindication:** Severe anaphylactic reaction to **Egg protein** (as vaccines are grown in eggs).

#### 2. Chemoprophylaxis
*   Using antivirals (Oseltamivir) for prevention in high-risk contacts during outbreaks (not a substitute for vaccination).

#### 3. General Measures
*   **Respiratory Etiquette:** Covering mouth while coughing/sneezing.
*   **Hand Hygiene:** Frequent washing with soap or sanitizer.
*   **Social Distancing:** Isolation of cases and avoiding crowds during epidemics.
*   **Surveillance:** National networks (like IDSP in India) to monitor ILI and SARI (Severe Acute Respiratory Infections).

### Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 "Swine Flu"
*   **Origin:** Emerged in Mexico (2009).
*   **Virus:** A triple reassortant virus containing genes from swine, avian, and human influenza.
*   **Current Status:** Now circulates as a seasonal influenza strain.
*   **Categorization (Indian Guidelines):**
    *   **Category A:** Mild fever/cough. Home isolation, symptomatic care. No testing needed.
    *   **Category B:** High fever/severe sore throat OR high-risk group (pregnant, elderly, etc.). Home isolation + **Oseltamivir**. No testing needed.
    *   **Category C:** Breathlessness, chest pain, hypotension, cyanosis (Red Flag signs). **Hospitalization + Testing + Oseltamivir**.
