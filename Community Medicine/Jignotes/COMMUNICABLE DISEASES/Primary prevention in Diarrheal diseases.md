# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Primary prevention in Diarrheal diseases

### Primary Prevention in Diarrheal Diseases

Primary prevention aims to prevent the onset of disease by removing risk factors or interrupting the chain of transmission before the disease process begins. In the context of [[Diarrheal Diseases]], this involves breaking the **Faecal-Oral transmission route**.

The core concept is the establishment of a **[[Sanitation Barrier]]**. This barrier segregates faeces and prevents the pathogens from reaching a new host through the **5 Fs**: **F**luids, **F**ingers, **F**lies, **F**omites, and **F**ood.

### 1. Health Promotion Measures

These are general measures to improve the overall health and resistance of the community and cut transmission routes.

**A. Sanitation and Excreta Disposal**
*   **Use of Sanitary Latrines:** Promoting the construction and use of sanitary latrines (e.g., Water seal, RCA type) to ensure safe disposal of human excreta.
*   **Elimination of Open Defecation:** Preventing soil and water pollution caused by indiscriminate defecation.
*   **Proper Waste Disposal:** Hygienic disposal of solid wastes and community liquid wastes (sullage) to prevent fly breeding.

**B. Safe Water Supply**
*   **Access:** Ensuring adequate supply of clean water for drinking, cooking, and hygiene.
*   **Purification:** Chlorination of community water supplies or boiling water at the household level.
*   **Source Protection:** Keeping wells and water sources at least **15 meters** away from latrines/sources of contamination.

**C. Food Hygiene**
*   **Handling:** Promoting hand washing before preparing food.
*   **Preparation:** Thorough cooking of food (kills pathogens like *E. coli* and *Salmonella*).
*   **Storage:** Proper refrigeration to prevent bacterial multiplication; food should be covered to protect from flies.
*   **Milk Safety:** Pasteurization or boiling of milk.

**D. Personal and Domestic Hygiene**
*   **[[Hand Washing]]:** The single most important measure. Washing hands with soap and water after defecation, after cleaning a child's bottom, and before eating/feeding.
*   **Fly Control:** Screening of kitchens and latrines.

**E. Nutrition and Child Care Practices**
*   **Exclusive [[Breast feeding]]:** Protective against gastrointestinal infections for the first 6 months of life. Breast milk provides IgA antibodies and ensures hygienic feeding.
*   **Weaning Practices:** Safe preparation of complementary foods to avoid contamination.
*   **[[Vitamin A]] Supplementation:** Vitamin A deficiency is a risk factor for severe diarrhea. Supplementation reduces mortality and severity of diarrheal episodes.

### 2. Specific Protection Measures

These are targeted interventions to prevent specific diseases.

**A. Immunization**
*   **[[Rotavirus Vaccine]]:** Prevents severe, dehydrating diarrhea caused by Rotavirus. Included in the National Immunization Schedule (oral drops at 6, 10, 14 weeks).
*   **[[Measles Vaccine]]:** Measles is a major cause of diarrheal morbidity/mortality. Vaccination at 9 months prevents measles-associated diarrhea (can prevent up to 25% of diarrheal deaths).
*   **Cholera Vaccine:** Oral Cholera Vaccines (e.g., Dukoral, Shanchol) are used in endemic areas or during outbreaks/disasters but offer shorter protection.
*   **Typhoid Vaccine:** Vi-polysaccharide or Ty21a vaccines for typhoid fever prevention.

**B. Chemoprophylaxis**
*   Generally **not recommended** for mass community use in diarrheal diseases (like Cholera) due to the risk of resistance and short-term benefit. It may be used for close household contacts in specific scenarios.

### Clinical Relevance & Impact
*   **Malnutrition-Infection Cycle:** Diarrhea leads to malnutrition, and malnutrition predisposes a child to diarrhea. Primary prevention breaks this vicious cycle.
*   **Child Mortality:** Diarrhea is a leading cause of under-5 mortality. Interventions like breastfeeding and Rotavirus vaccination significantly reduce IMR and U5MR.

### Mnemonic for Prevention: "WASH & VACCINES"

*   **W**ater (Safe and potable)
*   **A**void Open Defecation (Sanitary Latrines)
*   **S**oap (Hand washing)
*   **H**ygiene (Food and Personal)
*   **&**
*   **V**itamin A Supplementation
*   **A**lways Breastfeed (Exclusive 6 months)
*   **C**holera/Typhoid Vaccine (if indicated)
*   **C**ook Food Thoroughly
*   **I**mmunization (Rotavirus, Measles)
*   **N**utrition (Balanced diet)
*   **E**ducation (Health education)
*   **S**anitation Barrier
