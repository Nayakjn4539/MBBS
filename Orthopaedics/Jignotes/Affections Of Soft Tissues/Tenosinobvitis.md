# Tenosynovitis

### Definition
[[Tenosynovitis]] is defined as the inflammation of the [[tendon]] and its respective [[synovial sheath]]. It must be distinguished from [[tenovaginitis]], where the pathology primarily involves the fibrous sheath of the tendon rather than the synovial lining.

### Classification
Broadly, tenosynovitis is classified into two types based on etiology:

| Type | Etiology | Common Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Irritative (Non-infective)** | Excessive friction, overuse, or repetitive microtrauma. | [[De Quervain’s tenosynovitis]], [[Trigger finger]], [[Trigger thumb]]. |
| **Infective** | Bacterial invasion (Direct inoculation or hematogenous). | [[Acute suppurative tenosynovitis]], [[Tubercular tenosynovitis]]. |

### 1. De Quervain's Tenosynovitis (Stenosing Tenovaginitis)
This condition involves inflammation and thickening of the common tendon sheath of the [[Abductor Pollicis Longus]] (APL) and [[Extensor Pollicis Brevis]] (EPB) as they pass through the first dorsal compartment of the wrist at the [[radial styloid process]].

**Clinical Features:**
*   **Demographics:** Common in women (30–50 years), often associated with pregnancy or lactation (fluid retention) and repetitive use (e.g., washerwomen, typists).
*   **Symptoms:** Pain over the [[radial styloid process]], aggravated by thumb movements (especially abduction and extension).
*   **Signs:**
    *    tenderness localized to the tip of the radial styloid.
    *   Sometimes a palpable nodule or thickening of the sheath.

**Special Test: Finkelstein’s Test**
*   **Procedure:** The patient makes a fist with the thumb tucked inside the fingers. The examiner then forcefully deviates the wrist towards the ulnar side.
*   **Positive Result:** Sharp, excruciating pain over the [[radial styloid process]].
*   **Note:** This test is not pathognomonic; it can be positive in [[first carpometacarpal arthritis]] or [[Wartenberg's syndrome]].

**Treatment:**
*   **Conservative:** Rest, splinting (thumb spica), [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs).
*   **Injection:** Local infiltration of [[hydrocortisone]] into the tendon sheath.
*   **Surgical:** Surgical release of the thickened sheath if conservative measures fail.

### 2. Trigger Finger / Thumb (Stenosing Tenovaginitis)
A condition characterized by the inability to extend a flexed finger, which then snaps open with a click (triggering).

**Pathology:**
*   Constriction of the fibrous flexor sheath, specifically at the level of the **A1 pulley** (metacarpophalangeal joint level).
*   A nodule forms on the [[flexor tendon]] distal to the constriction. When the finger flexes, the nodule passes proximal to the pulley; upon extension, it gets trapped, causing locking.

**Clinical Features:**
*   **Site:** Ring finger and thumb are most commonly affected.
*   **Symptoms:** Pain at the base of the finger, clicking sensation, and locking of the finger in flexion.
*   **Palpation:** A tender nodule may be palpable at the base of the finger (over the [[metacarpal head]]).

**Treatment:**
*   **Conservative:** [[Corticosteroid injection]] into the sheath.
*   **Surgical:** Surgical release of the **A1 pulley**.

### 3. Acute Suppurative Tenosynovitis
A serious pyogenic infection of the synovial sheath of the flexor tendons.

**Surgical Anatomy & Spread:**
*   **Index, Middle, Ring Fingers:** Synovial sheaths usually end at the level of the transverse palmar crease. Infection is confined to the digit but may rupture into the [[mid-palmar space]] or [[thenar space]].
*   **Little Finger:** Continuous with the [[Ulnar bursa]]. Infection spreads to the palm and wrist.
*   **Thumb:** Continuous with the [[Radial bursa]]. Infection spreads to the wrist.
*   **Horseshoe Abscess:** A communication between the ulnar and radial bursae allows infection to spread from the thumb to the little finger (or vice versa).

**Etiology:**
*   Puncture wounds (thorns, needles, cuts).
*   Extension from a [[subcutaneous abscess]] (e.g., [[felon]]).
*   **Organism:** *[[Staphylococcus aureus]]* (most common), *[[Streptococcus]]*.

**Clinical Features (Kanavel’s Signs):**
These four cardinal signs are diagnostic for infectious tenosynovitis:
1.  **Fusiform swelling:** Uniform swelling of the entire finger.
2.  **Flexion posture:** The finger is held in a semi-flexed position to relax the tendon.
3.  **Tenderness:** Exquisite tenderness along the entire course of the [[flexor tendon sheath]].
4.  **Pain on extension:** Severe pain on passive extension of the finger (most specific sign).

**Clinical Implication:**
Tenderness is restricted to the sheath. If the point of maximum tenderness is over the middle phalanx or joint, it may indicate [[osteomyelitis]] or [[septic arthritis]].

**Treatment:**
*   **Medical:** High-dose intravenous [[antibiotics]], hand elevation, and splinting.
*   **Surgical:** If no improvement within 24 hours or if frank pus is present:
    *   **Incision and Drainage:** Incisions are made at the distal and proximal ends of the sheath.
    *   **Irrigation:** The sheath is irrigated with saline or antibiotic solution using a fine catheter.

### 4. Tubercular Tenosynovitis
A chronic inflammation caused by *[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]*.

**Compound Palmar Ganglion:**
*   It is a tubercular infection of the [[ulnar bursa]].
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Soft, fluctuant swelling appearing above and below the [[flexor retinaculum]] (hourglass shape).
    *   **Cross-fluctuation:** Pressing the swelling in the palm increases swelling at the wrist and vice versa.
    *   **Melon Seed Bodies:** The sheath contains fibrous bodies resembling melon seeds, which give a gritty sensation on palpation.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   [[Antitubercular chemotherapy]] (ATT).
    *   Surgical excision of the thickened synovium if the mass persists.
