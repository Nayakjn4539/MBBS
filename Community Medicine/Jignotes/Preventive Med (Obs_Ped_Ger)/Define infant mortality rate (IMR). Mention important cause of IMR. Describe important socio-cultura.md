# [[PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IN OBSTETRICS, PAEDIATRICS AND GERIATRICS]] > Define infant mortality rate (IMR). Mention important cause of IMR. Describe important socio-cultural factors affecting infant mortality.

### Definition of Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)

**[[Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)]]** is defined as the ratio of infant deaths (deaths of children under 1 year of age) registered in a given year to the total number of live births registered in the same year, usually expressed as a rate per **1,000 live births**.

It is widely regarded as the **most sensitive indicator** of the health status of a community, the level of living of people, and the effectiveness of [[Maternal and Child Health (MCH)]] services.

**Formula:**
$$IMR = \frac{\text{Number of deaths of children less than 1 year of age in a year}}{\text{Number of live births in the same year}} \times 1000$$

### Important Causes of Infant Mortality

The causes are generally divided into neonatal (first 4 weeks) and post-neonatal (1-12 months) periods.

| **Neonatal Mortality (Endogenous Factors)** | **Post-Neonatal Mortality (Exogenous Factors)** |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1. **[[Low Birth Weight]] (LBW) and Prematurity** (Single most important cause) | 1. **[[Diarrhoeal diseases]]** |
| 2. Birth injury and difficult labor | 2. **[[Acute Respiratory Infections]] (ARI)** |
| 3. Sepsis | 3. Malnutrition |
| 4. Congenital anomalies | 4. Communicable diseases |
| 5. Hemolytic diseases of newborn | 5. Accidents |
| 6. Conditions of placenta and cord | |
| 7. Tetanus (Neonatal) | |

**Note on Leading Causes in India:** The principal causes are **Low Birth Weight (57%)**, Respiratory infections (17%), Diarrhoeal diseases (4%), and Congenital malformations (5%).

### Socio-Cultural Factors Affecting Infant Mortality

Infant mortality is not just a medical problem; it is deeply rooted in the social and cultural fabric of the community.

**1. Breast-feeding Practices**
*   Breast milk contains nutritional content and natural immunizing agents ([[IgA]]) essential for survival.
*   **Early weaning** and the introduction of bottle-feeding in poor hygienic conditions significantly increase the risk of death due to diarrheal diseases and malnutrition compared to breast-fed infants.

**2. Early Marriages (Teenage Pregnancy)**
*   Babies born to teenage mothers (below 19 years) have the highest risk for both neonatal and post-neonatal mortality due to biological immaturity and lack of child-rearing skills.

**3. Sex of the Child (Gender Bias)**
*   In many parts of India, female infants receive far less attention (nutrition and medical care) than males due to a strong son preference ("Female deficit syndrome").
*   While biologically neonatal mortality is higher in males, **post-neonatal mortality is often higher in females** in India due to social neglect.

**4. Quality of Mothering**
*   Childcare is an art that must be learnt. Even in poverty, an efficient mother with good **"mothercraft"** skills regarding hygiene, feeding, and oral rehydration can ensure child survival.

**5. Maternal Education**
*   Illiteracy is the greatest barrier to health.
*   Educated mothers tend to marry later, delay child-bearing, utilize health services better, and practice family planning. This leads to fewer children and better survival rates.

**6. Religion and Caste**
*   Cultural patterns, habits, customs, and traditions regarding cleanliness, eating, and clothing vary by caste and religion, influencing IMR. For example, some communities may have food taboos during pregnancy or lactation.

**7. Broken Families and Illegitimacy**
*   IMR tends to be higher in broken families (separated/widowed parents) or in cases of illegitimacy, where the child may be unwanted or lack social and financial support.

**8. Harmful Traditional Customs (Brutal Habits)**
*   Certain age-old customs are deleterious to infant health:
    *   **Depriving the baby of [[Colostrum]]** (first milk).
    *   Application of **cow dung** or mud to the cut end of the umbilical cord (risk of Tetanus).
    *   Branding the skin for healing.
    *   Frequent purgation.

**9. The Untrained Dai (Traditional Birth Attendant)**
*   In rural areas, deliveries conducted by untrained dais with poor hygiene (unclean hands/instruments) contribute significantly to neonatal mortality (e.g., Sepsis, Tetanus).

**10. Environmental Sanitation**
*   Lack of safe water, poor drainage, and overcrowding lead to recurrent infections like diarrhea and skin diseases, which the young infant cannot withstand.

### Clinical Relevance
*   **High Risk Strategy:** Identification of "At Risk" infants (e.g., LBW, twins, birth order >5, artificial feeding) is crucial for reducing IMR.
*   **Essential Newborn Care:** Simple interventions like "5 Cleans" during delivery and early initiation of breastfeeding can prevent a significant proportion of neonatal deaths.

### Mnemonic
To remember the factors affecting IMR, use **"BIG FEMALES"**:
*   **B**reast feeding (lack of)
*   **I**llegitimacy
*   **G**ender (Sex of child)
*   **F**amily structure (Broken families)
*   **E**arly marriage
*   **M**aternal Education
*   **A**ge of mother
*   **L**ow Birth Weight (Biological)
*   **E**nvironmental sanitation
*   **S**ocial customs (Brutal habits/Untrained dais)
