# [[Esophagus]] > Radiology of Esophagus

### **Radiology of the Esophagus**

Radiological evaluation is fundamental in the diagnosis of esophageal disorders, ranging from structural abnormalities and motility disorders to foreign bodies and malignancies. The choice of modality depends on the clinical presentation.

---

### **1. Plain Radiography**

Although limited in evaluating mucosal details, plain X-rays are often the first line of investigation in emergencies.

#### **Views**
*   **Cervical Spine/Soft Tissue Neck (Lateral & AP):** To evaluate the cervical [[esophagus]] and pharynx.
*   **Chest X-ray (PA & Lateral):** To evaluate the thoracic esophagus and mediastinum.

#### **Key Findings and Indications**
*   **Foreign Bodies (FB):**
    *   **Radio-opaque FB:** Coins, dentures, metallic objects are clearly visible.
    *   **Orientation Rule:** Flat objects (like coins) in the [[esophagus]] lie in the **coronal plane** (appear circular on AP view). Objects in the [[trachea]] lie in the **sagittal plane** (appear edge-on/slit-like on AP view) because of the C-shaped tracheal rings.
    *   **Radiolucent FB:** May present as an air bubble in the cervical esophagus or widened prevertebral shadow.
*   **Perforation:**
    *   **Surgical Emphysema:** Linear streaks of air in the prevertebral plane or subcutaneous tissue.
    *   **Pneumomediastinum/Pneumothorax:** Air in the mediastinum or pleural space.
    *   **Hamman’s Sign:** Crunching sound over the heart due to mediastinal air (Boerhaave syndrome).
    *   **Widening of Mediastinum:** Indicative of mediastinitis.
*   **Retropharyngeal Abscess:** Widening of the prevertebral soft tissue shadow on lateral view (normal thickness: 7mm at C2, 22mm at C6 in adults).
*   **Tracheal Compression:** Displacement or compression of the tracheal air column by esophageal masses or thyroid enlargement.

### **2. Contrast Studies (Barium Swallow/Esophagogram)**

This is the **gold standard** for evaluating swallowing disorders, luminal patency, and mucosal integrity.

#### **Techniques**
1.  **Full Column (Single Contrast):** Esophagus distended with thin barium. Best for contour abnormalities (e.g., [[Stricture]], indentation).
2.  **Mucosal Relief:** Collapsed esophagus coated with thick barium. Best for mucosal detail (e.g., [[Esophageal varices]], early malignancy).
3.  **Double Contrast:** Uses high-density barium and gas (effervescent agent) to distend the lumen. Best for fine mucosal details and small ulcerative lesions.

#### **Pathological Findings on Barium Swallow**

| Condition | Radiological Appearance |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Achalasia Cardia]]** | • **Bird's Beak** or **Pencil-tip** appearance: Smooth tapering of the lower esophagus.<br>• **Sigmoid Esophagus**: Dilated, tortuous esophagus with fluid level (Megaesophagus).<br>• **Hurst Phenomenon**: Barium passes into the stomach intermittently like snowflakes. |
| **[[Carcinoma Esophagus]]** | • **Rat-tail appearance**: Irregular, ragged narrowing of the lumen.<br>• **Apple-core deformity**: Annular constricting lesion with overhanging edges (shouldering).<br>• Irregular filling defect without significant proximal dilatation. |
| **[[Benign Stricture]]** | • Smooth, tapering narrowing (concentric).<br>• Significant proximal fusiform dilatation (more than in malignancy). |
| **[[Diffuse Esophageal Spasm]]** | • **Corkscrew Esophagus** or **Rosary Bead** appearance due to segmented non-peristaltic contractions. |
| **[[Pharyngeal Pouch]] (Zenker's)** | • Contrast-filled sac arising posteriorly at the level of C5-C6 (Killian’s dehiscence). |
| **[[Esophageal Varices]]** | • **String of pearls** or worm-eaten appearance (serpentine filling defects) in the lower esophagus. |
| **[[Hiatus Hernia]]** | • Herniation of the stomach portion above the diaphragm. |
| **[[Plummer-Vinson Syndrome]]** | • Web-like filling defect in the post-cricoid region/upper esophagus. |

#### **Mnemonics for X-ray Appearances**
*   **A**chalasia = **A**vian beak (Bird's Beak).
*   **C**ancer = **C**ore (Apple Core) or **R**at tail (Ragged).
*   **S**pasm = **S**crewdriver shape (Corkscrew).

**Clinical Implications:**
*   **Contraindications:** Barium is contraindicated in suspected **perforation** (mediastinitis risk) or aspiration. Use water-soluble contrast (e.g., Gastrografin) instead.
*   **Foreign Bodies:** Barium should be avoided if a foreign body is suspected as it coats the object and makes subsequent endoscopic removal difficult.

---

### **3. Videofluoroscopy (Modified Barium Swallow)**

*   **Procedure:** Radiologist and speech pathologist observe the swallowing mechanism in real-time using varying consistencies of barium.
*   **Indications:** Gold standard for evaluating **oropharyngeal dysphagia**, aspiration, and coordination of the swallow reflex.
*   **Differentiates:** Mechanical lesions from motility disorders.

---

### **4. Computed Tomography (CT) Scan**

CT is essential for staging malignancies and evaluating extraluminal pathology.

*   **Indications:**
    *   **Staging [[Esophageal Cancer]]:** Assesses wall thickness, invasion of adjacent structures (aorta, trachea, pericardium), and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
    *   **Trauma/Perforation:** Detects extraluminal air, fluid collections, and mediastinitis.
    *   **Deep Neck Infections:** Evaluates retropharyngeal or parapharyngeal abscesses extending to the mediastinum.
    *   **Foreign Bodies:** To localize radiolucent FBs (like fish bones) not seen on plain X-ray.

---

### **5. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**

*   **Role:** Limited role compared to CT due to motion artifacts from heart and breathing.
*   **Indications:**
    *   Better soft tissue resolution for staging head and neck tumors involving the upper esophagus.
    *   Evaluating intramural pathology.

---

### **6. Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS)**

*   **Procedure:** An ultrasound probe is attached to the tip of an endoscope.
*   **Role:**
    *   Most accurate method for **T-staging** (depth of tumor invasion) of [[Carcinoma Esophagus]].
    *   Assessment of regional lymph nodes.

---

### **7. Positron Emission Tomography (PET)**

*   **Role:** Used in advanced malignancy to detect **distant metastases** and recurrence.
*   **Mechanism:** Uses FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) to identify metabolically active tumor cells.
