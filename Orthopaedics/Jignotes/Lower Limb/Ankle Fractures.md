# Ankle Fractures

[[Ankle fractures]] are among the most common intra-articular fractures affecting the weight-bearing joints. They encompass a spectrum of injuries ranging from simple avulsion fractures to complex fracture-dislocations involving the [[tibia]], [[fibula]], and [[talus]].

### Relevant Anatomy
The [[ankle joint]] is a modified hinge joint (mortise and tenon) formed by:
*   **The Mortise:** Formed by the distal articular surfaces of the [[tibia]] (medial malleolus and plafond) and [[fibula]] (lateral malleolus), connected by the [[tibiofibular syndesmosis]].
*   **The Tenon:** The body of the [[talus]].

**Ligamentous Stability:**
*   **Medial:** [[Deltoid ligament]] (Strong, resists eversion).
*   **Lateral:** [[Lateral collateral ligament complex]] (ATFL, CFL, PTFL) - resists inversion.
*   **Syndesmosis:** Anterior and posterior inferior tibiofibular ligaments and the interosseous membrane.

**Clinical Implication:** The stability of the ankle depends on the integrity of the "ring" formed by the bones and ligaments. A break in one part of the ring often implies a break or ligament tear in another part (Rule of the Ring).

### Mechanisms of Injury
Injuries result from deforming forces applied to the foot relative to the leg.
*   **Twisting forces:** Usually low-energy injuries (sports, misstep).
    *   **Supination-External Rotation:** Most common mechanism.
    *   **Pronation-External Rotation:** Often causes high fibular fractures and syndesmotic injury.
*   **Vertical Compression:** Causes axial loading damage, leading to [[Pilon fractures]].

### Classification Systems

#### 1. Danis-Weber Classification
This is the most clinically useful classification, based on the level of the [[fibula fracture]] in relation to the [[tibiofibular syndesmosis]]. It predicts the likelihood of syndesmotic instability.

| Type | Level of Fibula Fracture | Syndesmosis Status | Stability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type A** | **Below** the syndesmosis (infrasyndesmotic) | Intact | Usually Stable |
| **Type B** | **At** the level of the syndesmosis (transsyndesmotic) | Partial disruption possible | Variable stability |
| **Type C** | **Above** the syndesmosis (suprasyndesmotic) | Always disrupted | Unstable |

#### 2. Lauge-Hansen Classification
Based on the mechanism of injury. It consists of two words:
1.  **First word:** Position of the foot at the time of injury (Supination or Pronation).
2.  **Second word:** Direction of the deforming force (Adduction, Abduction, or External Rotation).
    *   *Example:* Supination-External Rotation (SER) is the most common type.

#### 3. Pott’s Fracture (Historical Eponym)
A general term often used for bimalleolar or trimalleolar fractures.
*   **1st Degree:** Unimalleolar.
*   **2nd Degree:** Bimalleolar.
*   **3rd Degree:** Trimalleolar.

### Specific Fracture Patterns

*   **[[Pilon fracture]] (Tibial Plafond Fracture):** Intra-articular fracture of the distal tibia caused by vertical compression (axial loading). Usually comminuted with significant soft tissue damage.
*   **[[Maisonneuve fracture]]:** Proximal fibula fracture associated with medial malleolus fracture or deltoid ligament rupture and syndesmotic disruption. (Always check the knee/proximal leg in ankle injuries!).
*   **[[Cotton’s fracture]] (Trimalleolar fracture):** Involves medial malleolus, lateral malleolus, and the posterior malleolus (posterior lip of tibia).
*   **[[Tillaux fracture]]:** Avulsion fracture of the anterolateral aspect of the distal tibial epiphysis (seen in adolescents).

### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:** Pain, swelling, inability to bear weight.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Look:** Deformity, bruising (ecchymosis), swelling, fracture blisters (common in high-energy trauma).
    *   **Feel:** Tenderness over malleoli, proximal fibula (to rule out Maisonneuve), and ligaments. Check distal neurovascular status (dorsalis pedis pulse).
    *   **Move:** Restricted and painful range of motion.

**Clinical Implication:** If there is medial tenderness without a fracture on X-ray in a patient with a fibular fracture, suspect a [[deltoid ligament]] rupture and potential instability.

### Imaging

#### 1. Plain Radiography (X-rays)
Standard trauma series includes:
*   **Anteroposterior (AP) View:** Shows medial and lateral malleoli.
*   **Lateral View:** Shows talar subluxation, posterior malleolus fractures, and calcaneus.
*   **Mortise View:** AP view with the leg internally rotated 15–20 degrees. This eliminates the overlap of the fibula and tibia, allowing assessment of the joint space.
    *   *Look for:* Medial clear space widening (>4mm suggests instability/deltoid rupture) and [[tibiofibular overlap]].

#### 2. CT Scan
*   Indicated for complex intra-articular fractures ([[Pilon fractures]]), trimalleolar fractures, and preoperative planning.

#### 3. Stress X-rays
*   Performed to assess dynamic instability (e.g., deltoid ligament competence in isolated fibula fractures).

### Management

**Goal:** Restore anatomical alignment and stability of the ankle mortise to prevent post-traumatic osteoarthritis.

#### 1. Conservative Management
*   **Indications:**
    *   Undisplaced fractures.
    *   Stable fractures (Weber A and some Weber B).
    *   Patients medically unfit for surgery.
*   **Method:** Below-knee [[Plaster of Paris]] cast or functional brace.
*   **Protocol:** Non-weight bearing initially, followed by walking cast. Total immobilization usually 6–8 weeks.

#### 2. Operative Management
*   **Indications:**
    *   Displaced unstable fractures.
    *   Talus subluxation.
    *   Weber C fractures (syndesmotic injury).
    *   Bimalleolar and Trimalleolar fractures.
    *   Open fractures.
*   **Timing:** Surgery should be performed immediately (before swelling sets in) or delayed (7–10 days) until swelling subsides ("wrinkle sign" appears) to prevent wound dehiscence.
*   **Technique: [[Open Reduction and Internal Fixation]] (ORIF)**
    *   **Lateral Malleolus:** Restored to length and fixed with a plate and screws (neutralization plate) or intramedullary nail.
    *   **Medial Malleolus:** Fixed with partially threaded cancellous screws (malleolar screws) or tension band wiring.
    *   **Syndesmosis:** If unstable after fixing malleoli, a **syndesmotic screw** (position screw) is placed from fibula to tibia.
    *   **Posterior Malleolus:** Fixed if >25% of articular surface is involved or if the shoulder of the ankle is unstable.

**Mnemonic for Surgical Planning:** **"Span, Scan, Plan"** (Especially for Pilon fractures)
*   **Span:** External fixator to bridge the joint.
*   **Scan:** CT scan to understand fragments.
*   **Plan:** Definitive fixation once soft tissues heal.

### Complications

#### Early
*   **Wound problems:** Skin necrosis and dehiscence (due to thin soft tissue envelope).
*   **Infection:** Superficial or deep.
*   **[[Compartment syndrome]]:** Rare in standard ankle fractures, common in Pilon fractures.
*   **[[Complex Regional Pain Syndrome]] (CRPS):** Formerly Sudeck’s atrophy.

#### Late
*   **Malunion:** Shortening or rotation of fibula leads to talar tilt and incongruity.
*   **Non-union:** Common in medial malleolus if soft tissue (periosteum) interposition occurs.
*   **Post-traumatic [[Osteoarthritis]]:** Major long-term complication if articular congruity is not restored.
*   **Joint Stiffness:** Loss of dorsiflexion.
