# [[OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH]] > Social security measures have a great role in preventing the health problems

### Social Security Measures: The Shield Against Health Problems

[[Social security]] is defined as the security that society furnishes through appropriate organization against certain risks to which its members are exposed. These risks primarily include sickness, invalidity, maternity, old age, and death. In the context of [[occupational health]], these measures play a pivotal role in **breaking the vicious cycle of poverty and disease**.

### The Role of Social Security in Prevention

Social security is not merely financial aid; it acts as a comprehensive preventive medicine tool by ensuring:

1.  **Access to Healthcare:** Removes financial barriers to early diagnosis and treatment (Secondary Prevention).
2.  **Economic Stability:** Prevents "social drift" where workers slide down the social ladder due to illness, leading to malnutrition and poor housing, which further exacerbates disease.
3.  **Rehabilitation:** Helps reintegrate the disabled worker into society, preventing psychological trauma and permanent dependency (Tertiary Prevention).
4.  **Protection of Vulnerable Groups:** Specifically protects women (maternity benefits) and children (dependant benefits).

### Key Legislations Providing Social Security in India

Several acts provide the legal framework for these protective measures:

| Legislation | Focus Area | Preventive Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Employees' State Insurance (ESI) Act, 1948]]** | Comprehensive health insurance | Provides full medical care, sickness cash benefits, and maternity support. |
| **[[Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923]]** | Compensation for injury/death | Financial support prevents destitution following industrial accidents. |
| **[[Maternity Benefit Act, 1961]]** | Protection for working women | Ensures rest and nutrition during pregnancy/lactation, reducing maternal/infant mortality. |
| **[[Factories Act, 1948]]** | Health, safety, and welfare | Mandates safe environments (ventilation, cleanliness) to prevent occupational diseases. |

### The ESI Act: A Pillar of Preventive Health

The **Employees' State Insurance (ESI) Act, 1948**, is the most significant measure of social security in India. It is a contributory self-financing scheme.

**Current Contribution Rates (w.e.f. 1.7.2019):**
*   **Employees:** 0.75% of wages.
*   **Employers:** 3.25% of total wage bill.

#### Benefits of ESI and their Preventive Role

The ESI provides seven specific benefits that directly contribute to preventing health problems:

**1. Medical Benefit (Primary & Secondary Prevention)**
*   **Full Medical Care:** Provides curative and preventive services (immunization, family planning) to the insured person and their family.
*   **Scope:** Includes outpatient care, diagnostic services, and hospitalization.
*   **Impact:** Ensures early treatment, preventing minor ailments from becoming chronic or fatal.

**2. Sickness Benefit (Secondary Prevention)**
*   **Cash Payment:** Periodical cash payment (approx. 70% of wages) for up to **91 days** a year during certified sickness.
*   **Impact:** Allows the worker to rest and recover without the stress of lost wages, preventing the aggravation of illness.

**3. Maternity Benefit (Primary Prevention)**
*   **Paid Leave:** Full wages paid for **26 weeks** (confinement), 6 weeks (miscarriage), or additional days for sickness arising from pregnancy.
*   **Impact:** Protects the health of the mother and newborn by ensuring rest, preventing low birth weight, and facilitating breastfeeding.

**4. Disablement Benefit (Tertiary Prevention)**
*   **Temporary:** 90% of wages till recovery.
*   **Permanent:** Life pension for total disability based on loss of earning capacity.
*   **Impact:** Prevents the disabled worker from falling into destitution and malnutrition.

**5. Dependant’s Benefit**
*   **Pension:** 90% of wages paid to dependants (widow/children) if the worker dies due to employment injury.
*   **Impact:** Prevents the family from sliding into poverty and subsequent ill-health.

**6. Rehabilitation Benefit (Tertiary Prevention)**
*   **Allowances:** Vocational and physical rehabilitation for disabled insured persons.
*   **Impact:** Ensures the individual remains a productive member of society, boosting mental and social health.

**7. Funeral Expenses**
*   A lump sum (up to Rs. 15,000) is paid to the eldest surviving member to meet funeral costs.

*   **Safety:** Fencing of machinery and prohibition of young persons in dangerous operations.
*   **Welfare:** Mandates washing facilities, sitting arrangements, and **crèches** (if >30 women employed).

*   Provides unemployment allowance for employees rendered jobless due to factory closure or retrenchment.
*   *Preventive Role:* Mitigates the mental stress and physical deprivation associated with sudden unemployment.

### Clinical Relevance

*   **Certification:** Doctors play a crucial role in the social security system by certifying sickness, employment injuries, and cause of death.
*   **Notification:** Under the Factories Act, physicians must notify specific [[occupational diseases]] (e.g., silicosis, lead poisoning) to authorities to initiate preventive control measures in the workplace.
*   **Rehabilitation:** Physicians must guide patients toward rehabilitation benefits to ensure functional recovery and social reintegration.
