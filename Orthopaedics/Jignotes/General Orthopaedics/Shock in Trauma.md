# [[General Orthopaedics]] > Shock in Trauma

### Shock in Trauma

**Shock** is defined as the failure of the [[circulatory system]] to maintain adequate [[tissue perfusion]], which initially leads to reversible cellular injury and, if prolonged, to irreversible cellular injury and organ failure. In trauma settings, recognizing and managing shock is the primary step in saving a life.

### Classification of Shock in Trauma

There are five main types of shock relevant to trauma, categorized based on the underlying mechanism:

#### 1. Hypovolemic Shock (Most Common)
*   **Cause:** Secondary to [[hemorrhage]] (blood loss) or fluid loss (burns, vomiting).
*   **Mechanism:** Decrease in circulating blood volume leads to decreased venous return, decreased cardiac output, and inadequate tissue perfusion.
*   **Compensation:** The body attempts to maintain [[systolic blood pressure]] through tachycardia and vasoconstriction until about 30% of blood volume is lost.

#### 2. Cardiogenic Shock
*   **Cause:** Myocardial infarction or direct [[myocardial injury]] (blunt cardiac injury).
*   **Mechanism:** The heart pump fails to maintain adequate cardiac output despite normal intravascular volume.
*   **Clinical Clue:** Occurs in trauma patients who suffer chest trauma or have underlying cardiac conditions.

#### 3. Neurogenic Shock
*   **Cause:** High [[spinal cord transection]] or injury (usually above T6).
*   **Mechanism:** Loss of sympathetic outflow causes vasodilation (loss of vascular tone), leading to pooling of blood in the periphery.
*   **Key Distinction:** Unlike hypovolemic shock, there is **no tachycardia** (bradycardia is present) and extremities are **warm**.

#### 4. Septic Shock
*   **Cause:** Acute invasion of the bloodstream by microorganisms.
*   **Mechanism:** Release of toxins/cytokines causes vasodilation and myocardial depression.
*   **Trauma Context:** Unusual in acute trauma; typically a late complication of open injuries or hospital admission.

#### 5. Anaphylactic Shock
*   **Context:** Unusual in acute trauma but may occur due to drug reactions.

### Clinical Features of Hypovolemic Shock

Diagnosis relies on rapid assessment of vital signs. **Blood pressure** and **pulse** alone may be misleading in young, fit patients who compensate well initially.

*   **Early Signs:**
    *   Tachycardia (Pulse > 100/min).
    *   Tachypnea (Rapid, shallow breathing).
    *   Pale, cold, and clammy skin (due to vasoconstriction).
    *   Anxiety or agitation.
*   **Late Signs (Decompensation):**
    *   Hypotension (Systolic BP drops).
    *   Weak/feeble pulse.
    *   Confusion or coma.
    *   Oliguria (Reduced urine output) signaling renal impairment.

### Blood Loss Estimates in Orthopaedic Injuries

Significant blood loss can occur internally in closed fractures.

| Fracture Site | Estimated Blood Loss | Clinical Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Pelvis]]** | 1500 – 2000 mL | Can be life-threatening; requires pelvic binder/fixation |
| **[[Femur]]** | 1000 – 1500 mL | Significant contributor to shock; requires splinting |
| **[[Tibia]]** | 500 – 1000 mL | Moderate loss |
| **[[Humerus]]** | 250 – 500 mL | Less likely to cause shock in isolation |

> **Clinical Insight:** A patient with a closed femoral shaft fracture can lose enough blood into the thigh compartment to enter Class II or III shock without external bleeding.

### Management Principles (ATLS Protocol)

The management follows the **[[Advanced Trauma Life Support]] (ATLS)** guidelines, prioritizing life-threatening conditions.

#### 1. Primary Survey and Resuscitation (ABCDE)
*   **Airway:** Ensure patency with cervical spine protection.
*   **Breathing:** Administer high-flow oxygen.
*   **Circulation:**
    *   **Control Hemorrhage:** Apply direct pressure to external bleeds. Use **[[pelvic binders]]** for pelvic fractures.
    *   **Vascular Access:** Secure two large-bore IV cannulas (14G or 16G). If peripheral access fails, consider **[[intraosseous cannulation]]** or femoral vein access.
    *   **Fluid Resuscitation:**
        *   Start with warmed crystalloids (e.g., **[[Ringer's lactate]]**).
        *   **Bolus Strategy:** Give 2 Liters (adults) or 20 mL/kg (children). If bleeding persists, titrate fluids (250 mL boluses) to maintain a palpable radial pulse rather than normal BP to avoid "popping the clot" (permissive hypotension) until surgical control.
        *   **Blood Transfusion:** If unresponsive to fluids, administer type-specific blood or O-negative blood in exsanguinating hemorrhage.
*   **Disability:** Assess [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] (GCS) and pupil response.
*   **Exposure:** Undress patient to examine for other injuries but prevent hypothermia.

#### 2. Specific Fracture Management
*   **Splinting:** Reduces pain and blood loss. Use femoral traction splints for midshaft femur fractures.
*   **Pelvic Stabilization:** Application of a pelvic compression belt (e.g., SAM Sling) or external fixation helps tamponade bleeding from the venous plexus and cancellous bone.

#### 3. Monitoring
*   **Urine Output:** A key indicator of organ perfusion and response to resuscitation.
*   **Central Venous Pressure (CVP):** Useful in distinguishing hypovolemic from cardiogenic shock.

### Hypovolemic vs. Neurogenic Shock

Differentiating these two is critical in trauma patients with spinal injuries.

| Feature | [[Hypovolemic Shock]] | [[Neurogenic Shock]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pathophysiology** | Fluid/Blood loss | Loss of sympathetic tone (Vasodilation) |
| **Heart Rate** | **Tachycardia** (compensatory) | **Bradycardia** (unopposed parasympathetic tone) |
| **Skin Temperature** | Cold, clammy (vasoconstriction) | **Warm**, dry (vasodilation) |
| **Blood Pressure** | Hypotension | Hypotension |
| **Pulse Pressure** | Narrowed | Widened |
| **Response to Fluids** | Improves | Minimal improvement; may need vasoconstrictors |

### Complications of Shock
If not treated promptly, shock leads to:
1.  **[[Multi-organ failure]] (MODS):** Systemic inflammatory reaction leading to ICU admission and death.
2.  **[[Acute Renal Failure]]:** Due to prolonged hypoperfusion.
3.  **[[Coagulopathy]]:** Dilutional or consumptive, exacerbating bleeding.
