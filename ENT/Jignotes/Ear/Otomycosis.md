# [[Ear]] > Otomycosis

### **Otomycosis**

**Definition**
[[Otomycosis]] is a superficial, diffuse fungal infection affecting the squamous epithelium of the [[external auditory canal]] (EAC),. It is also known as "Singapore Ear" or fungal otitis externa.

### **Etiology and Microbiology**
It accounts for approximately 10% of otitis externa cases.

**Common Causative Organisms:**
| Organism | Prevalence | Appearance/Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Aspergillus niger]]** | Most Common | Black-headed filamentous growth; **"Wet newspaper"** appearance or wet blotting paper,,,. |
| **[[Candida albicans]]** | 2nd Most Common | White, creamy deposit; **"Cotton wool"** appearance,,. |
| **[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]** | Less common | Pale blue or green appearance,. |
| **[[Aspergillus flavus]]** | Rare | Yellowish/Green; often associated with pain,. |
| **Others** | Rare | *Candida tropicalis*, *Mucor*, *Penicillium*,. |

### **Predisposing Factors**
Certain conditions alter the local pH (normally acidic) or immune defense of the EAC, favoring fungal overgrowth.

*   **Climate:** Hot and humid climates (tropical and subtropical regions),.
*   **Topical Medications:** Prolonged use of broad-spectrum **antibiotic ear drops** or steroid drops (alters local flora),,.
*   **Immunocompromised State:** Uncontrolled [[Diabetes mellitus]], HIV/AIDS, patients on chemotherapy or steroids,,.
*   **Local Trauma:** Scratching the ear with contaminated objects (matchsticks, hairpins),.
*   **Chronic Ear Conditions:** Active [[chronic suppurative otitis media]] (CSOM), open mastoid cavities (after mastoidectomy),.
*   **Dermatological Conditions:** Seborrheic dermatitis, eczema,.
*   **Water Exposure:** Swimming ("Swimmer's ear" context).

### **Clinical Features**

**Symptoms:**
*   **[[Pruritus]] (Intense Itching):** The most common and predominant symptom, especially with *A. niger*,,.
*   **Ear Blockage/Fullness:** Due to accumulation of fungal debris,.
*   **Discharge:** Watery or serous discharge with a characteristic **musty odor**,.
*   **[[Otalgia]] (Ear Pain):** Suggests secondary bacterial infection or aggressive fungal invasion (e.g., *A. flavus*),,.
*   **[[Hearing Loss]]:** Mild conductive hearing loss due to complete occlusion of the canal by fungal mass,.

**Signs (Otoscopy):**
*   **Fungal Mass:** Visible debris appearing white, brown, black, or green resembling a wet piece of filter paper,.
    *   *[[Aspergillus]]:* Fine fungal filaments (hyphae) with spore heads (conidiophores).
    *   *[[Candida]]:* Soft, curd-like, white debris.
*   **Canal Skin:** Deep meatus skin appears sodden, red, congested, and edematous,.
*   **Tympanic Membrane:** May be congested or show granulations; fungal debris may be attached to the TM.

### **Diagnosis**
1.  **Clinical Examination:** Characteristic appearance on otoscopy is usually diagnostic.
2.  **Microscopy/Smear:** KOH mount or Gram stain reveals fungal hyphae or spores.
3.  **Culture:** Sabouraud's dextrose agar is used if the diagnosis is in doubt or cases are refractory,.
4.  **Blood Sugar:** Fasting/Post-prandial blood glucose to rule out underlying diabetes in recurrent cases.

### **Differential Diagnosis**
*   Bacterial [[Otitis Externa]].
*   [[Keratosis Obturans]].
*   Cholesteatoma of EAC.
*   Foreign Body.

### **Treatment**

**1. Aural Toilet (Most Important Step)**
*   Thorough removal of all fungal debris, discharge, and epithelial crusts is essential for antifungal drops to penetrate and act effectively,,.
*   **Methods:** Suction clearance (microsuction) or dry mopping. Syringing may be done but must be dried thoroughly afterwards,.

**2. Topical Antifungals**
*   **Specific Agents:**
    *   **[[Clotrimazole]] (1%):** Broad-spectrum, widely used,.
    *   **Nystatin:** Specific for *Candida* (100,000 units/ml),.
*   **Non-specific/Keratolytic Agents:**
    *   **2% Salicylic Acid in Alcohol:** Keratolytic action removes superficial layers of epidermis containing fungal mycelia. Alcohol acts as a drying agent,.
    *   **Gentian Violet (1%):** Painting the canal is effective but stains tissues,.
    *   **Povidone Iodine:** Broad antifungal activity.
*   **Acidifying Agents:** 2% Acetic acid drops (creates acidic environment hostile to fungi).

**3. Systemic Treatment**
*   Indicated only in severe, persistent, or invasive cases (e.g., immunocompromised patients).
*   Oral **[[Itraconazole]]** or **[[Fluconazole]]**,,.

**4. General Measures**
*   **Keep Ear Dry:** Avoid water entry during bathing/swimming,.
*   **Control Risk Factors:** Strict glycemic control in diabetics; stop antibiotic/steroid ear drops if being used,.
*   **Follow-up:** Antifungal treatment should be continued for 1 week *after* apparent cure to prevent recurrence,.

### **Complications**
*   **Secondary Bacterial Infection:** Commonly *Staphylococcus* or *Pseudomonas*, leading to increased pain and purulent discharge.
*   **TM Perforation:** Aggressive fungal infection (like *Aspergillus*) can lead to tympanic membrane perforation, which usually heals spontaneously after treatment.
*   **Invasive Fungal Otitis Externa:** Rare; involves temporal bone in immunocompromised hosts.
