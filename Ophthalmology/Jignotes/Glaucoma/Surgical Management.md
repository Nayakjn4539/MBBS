# Surgical Management of Glaucoma: Trabeculectomy and Tube Shunts

Surgical intervention in [[glaucoma]] is generally indicated when the target [[intraocular pressure]] (IOP) cannot be achieved or maintained with maximum tolerated medical therapy and laser procedures (like [[laser trabeculoplasty]]), or when there is progressive visual field loss or optic disc damage despite medical control.

## I. Trabeculectomy (Filtering Surgery)

[[Trabeculectomy]] is the "gold standard" filtering surgery for glaucoma. It creates a fistula between the [[anterior chamber]] (AC) and the sub-tenon/sub-conjunctival space to allow aqueous outflow, bypassing the obstructed trabecular meshwork.

### Mechanism of Action
*   **Fistulization:** Creates a new channel (fistula) through the limbus.
*   **Bypass:** Aqueous humour flows from the [[anterior chamber]] $\rightarrow$ through the fistula (guarded by a scleral flap) $\rightarrow$ into the sub-conjunctival space.
*   **Absorption:** Fluid forms a **filtering bleb** and is absorbed by episcleral veins and conjunctival lymphatics.

### Indications
1.  **Primary:**
    *   [[Primary Open Angle Glaucoma]] (POAG) uncontrolled by meds/laser.
    *   [[Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma]] (PACG) with extensive [[peripheral anterior synechiae]] (PAS > 270 degrees) or failed laser iridotomy.
2.  **Congenital/Developmental:** Failed [[goniotomy]] or [[trabeculotomy]].
3.  **Secondary:** Certain secondary glaucomas resistant to medical therapy.
4.  **Advanced Disease:** Can be primary therapy in advanced presentation with very high IOP and severe damage.

### Surgical Steps (Guarded Filtration Procedure)

1.  **Exposure:** Eye fixed in downward gaze (bridle suture).
2.  **Conjunctival Flap:** Either **limbal-based** or **fornix-based** conjunctival flap is raised to expose the sclera.
3.  **Scleral Flap:** A partial-thickness lamellar scleral flap (usually rectangular or triangular, ~4x4 mm) is dissected towards the limbus.
4.  **Application of Antimetabolites (Optional/High Risk):** [[Mitomycin C]] (MMC) or [[5-Fluorouracil]] (5-FU) applied to prevent fibrosis.
5.  **Ostium Creation (Trabeculectomy proper):** A small block of tissue containing cornea, sclera, and [[trabecular meshwork]] is excised (punched) under the scleral flap entering the anterior chamber.
6.  **Peripheral Iridectomy (PI):** Performed to prevent the iris from plugging the internal ostium.
7.  **Closure:** Scleral flap is sutured (tightness determines flow rate) and conjunctiva is closed watertight to allow bleb formation.

### Intraoperative Antimetabolites (Wound Modulation)
Failure of filtration surgery is most commonly due to **episcleral fibrosis** (scarring) leading to bleb failure. Antifibrotic agents are used to inhibit wound healing.

| Agent | Mechanism | Application | Indications (High Risk Cases) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Mitomycin C]] (MMC)** | Alkylating agent; inhibits DNA replication | Intraoperative sponge application (1-3 mins) | Young patients, Neovascular glaucoma, Aphakic/Pseudophakic glaucoma, Previous failed surgery, Black race |
| **[[5-Fluorouracil]] (5-FU)** | Pyrimidine antagonist; inhibits fibroblasts | Intraoperative or Post-operative subconjunctival injections | Similar to MMC, but generally less potent; requires multiple injections post-op |

**Clinical Implication:** While these agents increase success rates, they increase the risk of hypotony maculopathy and late-onset bleb-related [[endophthalmitis]] due to thin, avascular blebs.

### Complications of Trabeculectomy

**Early Post-operative:**
*   **[[Hyphaema]]:** Blood in AC.
*   **Shallow/Flat Anterior Chamber:** Due to over-filtration (low IOP) or malignant glaucoma (high IOP).
*   **Hypotony:** IOP < 6 mmHg; risk of choroidal detachment or maculopathy.
*   **Iris Prolapse:** Through the ostium.

**Late Post-operative:**
*   **Bleb Failure:** Encapsulated bleb (Tenon's cyst) or flat bleb due to scarring (Most common cause of failure).
*   **Blebitis/Endophthalmitis:** Infection of the bleb (white-on-red) extending into the eye; higher risk with antimetabolites.
*   **Cataract Formation:** Acceleration of preexisting cataract.

## II. Glaucoma Drainage Devices (GDDs) / Tube Shunts

Also known as **Seton operations** or **aqueous shunt implants**. These devices drain aqueous humor from the AC to a reservoir (plate) located in the equatorial sub-tenon space.

### Mechanism
A silicone tube is inserted into the [[anterior chamber]]. This tube is connected to a plate sutured to the sclera posteriorly (usually between rectus muscles). A fibrous capsule forms around the plate, creating a reservoir where aqueous is absorbed.

### Indications (Refractory Glaucomas)
Tube shunts are generally reserved for cases where trabeculectomy has failed or is likely to fail.
**Mnemonic: RUN PAST** (Situations for Tubes)
*   **R**efractory Glaucoma (Failed trabs)
*   **U**veitic Glaucoma (Active inflammation scars trabeculectomy blebs)
*   **N**eovascular Glaucoma (Active new vessels bleed in trabs)
*   **P**seudophakic/Aphakic Glaucoma (Conjunctival scarring often present)
*   **A**niridia
*   **S**carring (Severe conjunctival scarring from trauma/surgery)
*   **T**raumatic Glaucoma

### Types of Implants

| Feature | **Valved (Flow Restrictive)** | **Non-Valved (Non-Restrictive)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mechanism** | Contains a valve that opens only when IOP > specific level (e.g., 8-10 mmHg) to prevent hypotony. | Open tube; requires temporary ligature (suture tie-off) intra-op to prevent immediate hypotony until capsule forms (4-6 weeks). |
| **Examples** | **[[Ahmed Glaucoma Valve]] (AGV)**, Krupin | **Baerveldt**, Molteno |
| **Advantage** | Immediate IOP control; lower risk of post-op hypotony. | Larger surface area plates often achieve lower long-term IOP. |
| **Disadvantage** | Hypertensive phase (capsule fibrosis) is common. | Delayed IOP lowering (requires weeks for ligature to dissolve/open). |

### Complications Specific to GDDs
*   **Corneal Decompensation:** Tube touching the endothelium.
*   **Tube Erosion:** Tube eroding through the conjunctiva (requires patch graft).
*   **Diplopia:** Due to the bulk of the plate or muscle involvement (restrictive squint).
*   **Hypotony:** Especially in non-valved implants if ligature fails early.

## III. Other Surgical Modalities

### Ex-PRESS Mini Shunt
*   **Description:** A miniature stainless steel device implanted *under* a scleral flap (like a trabeculectomy).
*   **Mechanism:** Diverts aqueous from AC to sub-scleral space. It replaces the tissue excision (punch) step of trabeculectomy.
*   **Advantage:** Standardizes flow, reduces hypotony risk compared to standard trabeculectomy.

### Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgery (MIGS)
Used for mild-moderate glaucoma, often combined with cataract surgery.
*   **Trabectome:** Ablates trabecular meshwork.
*   **iStent:** Titanium micro-bypass stent placed in Schlemm's canal.
*   **XEN Gel Stent:** Gelatin stent creating subconjunctival drainage.
