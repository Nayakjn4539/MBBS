# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > AIDS is a behavioural disease

### AIDS: A Behavioural Disease

**AIDS** ([[Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome]]) is fundamentally termed a "behavioural disease" because the spread of the causative agent, [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus]] (HIV), is primarily determined by human behavior and lifestyle choices rather than environmental or vector-based factors. Man is viewed as the **agent** of his own disease; his health status is determined more by what he does to himself (risk-taking behavior) than what the virus does to him.

#### 1. Behavioral Modes of Transmission
The virus is transmitted via specific human actions that are largely voluntary and modifiable.

*   **Sexual Behaviour (Most Common):**
    *   **Multiple Sexual Partners:** Promiscuity significantly increases the risk of acquiring infection.
    *   **Unprotected Sex:** Failure to use barrier methods ([[Condoms]]) allows for fluid exchange.
    *   **Type of Intercourse:** Anal intercourse carries a higher risk than vaginal intercourse due to mucosal trauma; this is relevant for both heterosexual and [[Men who have Sex with Men]] (MSM) populations,.
    *   **Presence of STDs:** Behaviors leading to other [[Sexually Transmitted Diseases]] (STDs) (e.g., syphilis, chancroid) increase HIV transmission risk by 8–10 times due to genital inflammation and ulceration.

*   **Intravenous Drug Use (IDU):**
    *   The sharing of unsterilized needles and syringes among drug addicts is a high-efficiency route of transmission (>90% efficiency per exposure, though overall contribution to total cases varies by region),.

*   **Social and Cultural Determinants:**
    *   **Alcoholism:** Lowers inhibitions, leading to high-risk sexual encounters and failure to use protection.
    *   **Migration:** Single male migrants (e.g., truckers, laborers) separated from families often seek solace in casual sex or sex workers, acting as a **"Bridge Population"** between high-risk groups and the general population,.
    *   **Social Stigma:** Fear of social rejection prevents individuals from seeking testing or disclosing status to partners, fueling the [[Iceberg Phenomenon]] of the disease,.

#### 2. Epidemiological Evidence in India
Data from the **National AIDS Control Organization (NACO)** underscores the behavioral nature of the epidemic in India:
*   **Sexual Transmission:** Accounts for approximately **86-87%** of HIV infections,.
*   **Injecting Drug Use:** A major driver of the epidemic in North-Eastern states.

#### 3. Prevention relies on Behavior Change
Since there is no cure and no effective vaccine, the only weapon against AIDS is **Education** and **Behavioural Change**.

**Strategies for Behavior Modification:**
*   **IEC (Information, Education, and Communication):** To enable people to make life-saving choices (e.g., avoiding indiscriminate sex).
*   **BCC ([[Behaviour Change Communication]]):** Moving beyond awareness to actual practice modification.
*   **Targeted Interventions (TI):** specifically focused on High-Risk Groups (HRGs) to change behavior where the virus is most concentrated.

**The "ABC" Strategy for Prevention:**
1.  **A** – **A**bstinence (Delaying sexual debut).
2.  **B** – **B**e Faithful (Monogamy/Single partner).
3.  **C** – **C**ondom Use (Consistent and correct use).

#### 4. High-Risk Behavioral Groups
Epidemiology classifies populations based on their behavioral risk patterns:

| Group Type | Categories | Behavioural Risk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High Risk Groups (HRG)** (Core Group) | • [[Female Sex Workers]] (FSW)<br>• [[MSM]]<br>• [[Injecting Drug Users]] (IDU)<br>• Transgenders | Multiple partners, selling sex, sharing needles. |
| **Bridge Population** | • Truckers<br>• Migrant laborers | Frequent casual sex/clientele of sex workers; they spread HIV from Core groups to the General population. |
| **General Population** | • Wives/Spouses<br>• Children | Low personal risk behavior but vulnerable due to the behavior of partners/parents. |

#### 5. Clinical Relevance & Counseling
*   **History Taking:** A physician must take a detailed psychosexual history to assess risk. This includes asking about number of partners, condom usage, and drug history.
*   **Counseling:** Pre-test and Post-test counseling are mandatory steps in [[ICTC]] (Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres) to ensure the patient understands the behavioral modifications required to prevent transmission (e.g., "Positive Prevention").

### Mnemonic for HIV Transmission Risk Assessment
**"The 4 Ps"**
*   **P**artners (Number, gender).
*   **P**ractices (Vaginal, anal, oral, IV drugs).
*   **P**rotection (Condom use frequency).
*   **P**ast History of STDs.
