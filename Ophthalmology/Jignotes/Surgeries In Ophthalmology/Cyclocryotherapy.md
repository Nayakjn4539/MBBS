# [[Surgeries In Ophthalmology]] > Cyclocryotherapy

### [[Cyclocryotherapy]]

**Definition**
[[Cyclocryotherapy]] is a **cyclo-destructive procedure** used to lower [[Intraocular Pressure]] (IOP) by destroying a part of the secretory [[Ciliary Epithelium]], thereby reducing aqueous secretion. It involves producing tissue injury by the application of intense cold (–40°C to –100°C).

**Principle**
*   **Mechanism of Action:** The procedure lowers IOP due to the destruction of the secretory [[Ciliary Epithelium]]. The cells are destroyed by **intracellular freezing** and subsequent thawing (freeze-thaw effect),.
*   **Cryo-unit Principle:** The working of cryoprobes is based on the **Joule-Thompson principle** of cooling.
*   **Cooling Agents:** The cryounit typically uses **Freon**, **Nitrous Oxide ($N_2O$)**, or **Carbon Dioxide ($CO_2$)** gas as a cooling agent.

**Indications**
This procedure is mainly reserved for intractable glaucomas where other medical and surgical modalities have failed.
1.  **[[Absolute Glaucoma]]:** To relieve pain in a blind, painful eye,,.
2.  **[[Neovascular Glaucoma]]:** Often used when filtration surgery is not feasible or has failed,.
3.  **Refractory Glaucoma:** Advanced glaucoma cases unresponsive to maximum medical therapy and trabeculectomy.

**Instrumentation**
*   **Cryounit:** A machine that regulates gas flow to the probe.
*   **Cryoprobe:** For cyclocryopexy, a **4 mm** tip probe is typically used. (Note: smaller probes like 1.5 mm are used for cataract and 2.5 mm for retina).

**Surgical Technique**

1.  **Anaesthesia:** [[Topical Anaesthesia]] and [[Peribulbar Block]] anesthesia are administered.
2.  **Exposure:** The eyelids are separated using an **Eye Speculum**.
3.  **Site of Application:** The cryoprobe is placed on the [[Sclera]]/conjunctiva approximately **3 mm from the [[Limbus]]**.
4.  **Freezing:** Freezing is activated to reach **–80°C** for **1 minute**.
5.  **Extent:** Usually, an area of **180° of the globe** is treated in one session (approx. 6–7 spots).
6.  **Retreatment:** If the procedure is ineffective, it may be repeated in the *same area* after 3 weeks. If still ineffective, the *remaining 180°* should be treated.

**Clinical Implications & Complications**
*   **Post-operative Pain:** Can be significant; requires analgesics.
*   **Inflammation:** Uveitis is a common sequela due to tissue destruction.
*   **[[Phthisis Bulbi]]:** Excessive freezing (treating 360° in one session) can lead to a hypotonic, shrunken eye (phthisis) due to complete shutdown of aqueous production.

### [[Eye Speculums]]

**Definition**
An eye speculum is a surgical instrument used to retract the eyelids and keep them apart to provide exposure of the eyeball during ocular surgeries and examinations,.

**Types of Eye Speculums**

| Type | Features | Uses/Advantages |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Universal Metallic Eye Speculum** | • Has two limbs and a spring mechanism with a screw to adjust the width.<br>• Blades are open (fenestrated).<br>• "Universal" because it fits both Right and Left eyes. | • General intraocular surgeries.<br>• Examination in uncooperative patients. |
| **Eye Speculum with Guard (Solid Blades)** | • Similar mechanism but has **solid blades** (guards) attached to the limbs. | • **Lash Protection:** Prevents eyelashes from entering the surgical field.<br>• Useful in [[Cataract Surgery]] and [[Corneal Surgery]]. |
| **Wire Speculum (Barraquer)** | • Made of a single bent wire.<br>• Very light in weight. | • **Minimal Pressure:** Causes minimal pressure on the eyeball, reducing the risk of expulsive hemorrhage or vitreous loss.<br>• Preferred for high-volume surgeries. |

**Common Clinical Uses**
Eye speculums are essential for almost all ophthalmic procedures:
1.  **Intraocular Surgeries:**
    *   [[Cataract Surgery]] (ECCE, SICS, Phacoemulsification).
    *   [[Glaucoma Surgery]] (Trabeculectomy).
    *   [[Keratoplasty]] (Corneal Transplant).
2.  **Extraocular Surgeries:**
    *   [[Squint]] surgery (Strabismus correction).
    *   [[Pterygium]] excision.
    *   [[Enucleation]] and [[Evisceration]].
3.  **Minor Procedures:**
    *   Removal of corneal or conjunctival [[Foreign Bodies]].
    *   Cauterization of corneal ulcers.
4.  **Examination:**
    *   Examining the eye in a patient with severe **blepharospasm**.
