# [[Corrosive Poisons]] > Carbolic Acid

### Carbolic Acid (Phenol)

**Synonyms:** Hydroxybenzene, Benzenol, Phenyl alcohol, Acidum carbolicum.

### 1. General Properties
*   **Nature:** It is an organic acid but acts as a **corrosive**.
*   **Appearance:** Colorless, prismatic, needle-like crystals.
*   **Reaction to Air:** Turns pink and liquefies on exposure to air (deliquescent).
*   **Odor:** Characteristic **"Phenolic"** or carbolic smell (like hospital disinfectants/Dettol).
*   **Taste:** Sweetish, burning taste.
*   **Solubility:** Slightly soluble in water; freely soluble in alcohol, ether, and glycerin.
*   **Commercial Forms:**
    *   **Lysol:** Brown liquid containing cresol and soap.
    *   **Dettol:** Chloroxylenol.

### 2. Mode of Action
*   **Local Action:**
    *   **Coagulation Necrosis:** It causes precipitation of proteins but does not penetrate deeply because the coagulum acts as a barrier.
    *   **Anesthetic Effect:** It causes degeneration of nerve endings, leading to local anesthesia (numbness).
*   **Systemic Action:**
    *   It is absorbed through **all routes** (skin, inhalation, ingestion, mucous membranes, and open wounds).
    *   **CNS Depressant:** Initially stimulates, then profoundly depresses the CNS.
    *   **Metabolic Acidosis:** Similar to salicylates.
    *   **Nephrotoxicity:** Causes acute tubular necrosis.

### 3. Clinical Features (Acute Poisoning - [[Carbolism]])

**A. Local Symptoms (GI Tract)**
*   **Burning pain:** Immediate burning sensation from mouth to stomach, followed by tingling and **numbness** (due to local anesthetic action).
*   **Corrosion:** Lips, mouth, and tongue show **corrosion**. The mucosa appears **white or greyish-white** (bleached) and hardened. Later, it may turn brown.
*   **Vomiting:** Usually **absent** due to the anesthetic effect on the gastric mucosa. If present, vomitus is mucoid and smells of phenol.
*   **Swallowing:** Difficult (Dysphagia).

**B. Systemic Symptoms**
*   **CNS:** Giddiness, headache, tinnitus, and muscular twitching followed by flaccid unconsciousness and **coma**.
*   **Pupils:** **Pinpoint/Contracted** (Miosis). *Note: This mimics [[Opioid Poisoning]] or Pontine Hemorrhage.*
*   **Respiratory:** Labored, stertorous breathing. Smell of phenol in breath.
*   **CVS:** Hypotension, rapid feeble pulse, cold clammy skin (Shock).
*   **Renal:** Oliguria, albuminuria, and hematuria leading to renal failure.

**C. [[Carboluria]] (Green/Black Urine)**
*   Urine is dark/smoky green on passing.
*   Turns **black** on standing/exposure to air.
*   **Mechanism:** Phenol is metabolized in the liver to **hydroquinone** and **pyrocatechol**. These metabolites undergo further oxidation in urine to produce the dark color.
*   *Note:* It must be differentiated from Alkaptonuria (Ochronosis) and Melanuria.

> **Mnemonic for Symptoms: "PHENOL"**
> *   **P** - Pinpoint pupils / Pigmentation (Ochronosis in chronic)
> *   **H** - Hard/Leathery stomach / Hypothermia
> *   **E** - Eschar (White)
> *   **N** - Nephrotoxicity / Numbness
> *   **O** - Odor (Phenolic)
> *   **L** - Lungs (Pulmonary edema) / Lysol

### 4. Chronic Poisoning (Phenolic Marasmus)
Occurs due to chronic absorption (historically in surgeons using carbolic spray or industrial workers).
*   **Symptoms:** Anorexia, weight loss, vomiting, dark urine.
*   **[[Ochronosis]]:** Pigmentation of cartilages, skin, and sclera.
*   **Skin:** Eruptions and vesicular dermatitis.

### 5. Fatal Dose and Period
*   **Fatal Dose:** 10–15 g (Pure phenol); 30–50 ml (Household phenol/Lysol).
*   **Fatal Period:** 3–4 hours (Death can occur very rapidly within minutes due to shock).

### 6. Diagnosis / Chemical Tests
1.  **Ferric Chloride Test:** Urine + 10% Ferric chloride $\rightarrow$ **Violet/Purple color**.
2.  **Bromine Water Test:** Urine + Bromine water $\rightarrow$ White precipitate (Tribromophenol).

### 7. Treatment
**A. Decontamination**
*   **Skin Contact:** Remove contaminated clothing. Wash with large amounts of water. Use **Polyethylene Glycol (PEG)** or methylated spirit/alcohol to dissolve and remove phenol. *Do not use grease/oil initially as it facilitates absorption.*
*   **Eye Contact:** Irrigate copiously with water or saline.

**B. Gastric Decontamination**
*   **Gastric Lavage:**
    *   Unlike other corrosives, **stomach wash IS ALLOWED** (cautiously) in phenol poisoning.
    *   **Reason:** The gastric mucosa becomes hardened and **leathery**, reducing the risk of perforation.
    *   **Lavage Fluid:** Use lukewarm water containing magnesium sulphate (Epsom salt) or sodium sulphate. These form insoluble sulphocarbolates which are harmless.
    *   Avoid alcohol in lavage (increases absorption).
*   **Demulcents:** Egg whites or milk (forms insoluble albuminates).
*   **Activated Charcoal:** Useful.

**C. Systemic Management**
*   **IV Fluids:** To treat shock and force diuresis (to prevent renal failure).
*   **Sodium Bicarbonate:** To treat metabolic acidosis.
*   **Methylene Blue:** If [[Methemoglobinemia]] is present (rare).
*   **Dialysis:** In case of renal failure.

### 8. Post-Mortem Appearances (Autopsy Findings)

**External:**
*   **Stains:** Corrosion marks near angles of mouth/chin (dribbling marks) – initially white/grey, turning brown.
*   **Smell:** Distinct phenolic odor from the body/cavities.

**Internal:**
*   **[[Leathery Stomach]]:** The gastric mucosa is tough, white/grey, corrugated, and feels like leather (hardened). It may show areas of necrosis.
*   **Intestines:** Usually spared (pyloric spasm prevents entry), but if entered, appear similar to the stomach.
*   **Kidneys:** Swollen, congested, showing acute tubular necrosis.
*   **Lungs:** Pulmonary edema and congestion.
*   **Brain:** Congested; smell of phenol is best detected upon opening the cranial cavity.

### 9. Medicolegal Aspects
1.  **Suicide:** Common due to easy availability (household disinfectants).
2.  **Accidental:** Common (mistaken for cough syrups or water due to colorless nature). Also in children.
3.  **Homicide:** Rare due to strong smell and taste.
4.  **Abortifacient:** Sometimes used (vaginal injection of Lysol) to induce abortion, leading to local necrosis and systemic toxicity.
5.  **Iatrogenic:** Accidental poisoning during medical procedures (e.g., chemical peeling).
6.  **Vitriolage:** Can be used for throwing (acid attacks), though less common than sulfuric acid.
