# [[HEALTH INFORMATION & BASIC MEDICAL STATISTICS]] > Define census

### Definition of Census

A **Census** is defined by the United Nations as "the total process of collecting, compiling and publishing **demographic, economic and social data** pertaining at a specified time or times, to all persons in a country or delimited territory".

It is the primary source of [[health information]] and provides a snapshot of the population at a specific point in time.

### Key Characteristics
1.  **Universality:** It covers *every* individual within the defined territory.
2.  **Simultaneity:** It is conducted at a specific point in time (Census moment).
3.  **Periodicity:** It is taken at regular intervals, usually every **10 years** in most countries, including India.
4.  **Government Sponsorship:** It is a massive administrative undertaking supported by the government and legal statutes.

### Methods of Enumeration
There are two main methods used globally:
| Method | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **De Facto** (Date System) | People are counted where they are physically present on the census night, regardless of their usual residence. (Used in India till 1931). |
| **De Jure** | People are counted at their place of **usual residence**, regardless of where they are on the census night. (India follows a modified de jure method). |

### Census in India
*   **History:** The first irregular census was conducted in 1872. The first **regular (synchronous) census** was taken in **1881**.
*   **Frequency:** Conducted every 10 years. The last census was in 2011 (15th Census).
*   **Legal Basis:** It is conducted under the **[[Census Act, 1948]]**.
*   **Authority:** The supreme officer is the **Registrar General and Census Commissioner**, under the Ministry of Home Affairs.
*   **Census Stop (Reference Date):** The snapshot of the population is taken as of **00.00 hours on 1st March** of the census year.

### Uses of Census in Medicine & Public Health
1.  **Calculation of Health Indices:** It provides the **denominator** (Mid-year population) required to calculate vital rates like [[Birth Rate]], [[Death Rate]], and Morbidity rates.
2.  **Health Planning:** Helps in planning health services, manpower (doctor-population ratio), and infrastructure based on population density and distribution.
3.  **Population Dynamics:** Determines the growth rate, age, and sex composition (Population Pyramid) of the community.
4.  **Socio-economic Status:** Provides data on literacy, occupation, and housing conditions which are determinants of health.

### Shortcomings/Sources of Error
*   **Missing Data:** Omission of floating populations (e.g., homeless).
*   **Age Heaping:** Tendency of people to report age in round figures (multiples of 5 or 10) rather than exact age.
*   **Time Lag:** Full results take several years to analyze and publish; data may become outdated.
*   **Cost:** It is a highly expensive and labor-intensive process.

### Mnemonic
To remember the UN definition components: **"CC P DES"**
*   **C**ollecting
*   **C**ompiling
*   **P**ublishing
*   **D**emographic
*   **E**conomic
*   **S**ocial data
