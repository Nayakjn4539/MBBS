# Radiation Hazards

Radiation acts as a [[physical agent]] in the environment that can cause discomfort, injury, or disease. It is defined as part of man's environment where exposure can result in somatic and genetic effects.

### Classification of Radiation
Radiation is broadly classified into two main groups based on its ability to penetrate tissues and deposit energy,:

1.  **[[Ionizing Radiation]]**: Capable of causing ionization in the nucleus of cells.
    *   **Electromagnetic:** X-rays, Gamma rays,.
    *   **Corpuscular:** Alpha particles, Beta particles, Protons, Neutrons,.
2.  **[[Non-ionizing Radiation]]**: Has less energy and longer wavelengths.
    *   **Examples:** Ultraviolet (UV), Visible light, Infrared, Microwave, Radiofrequency.

### Sources of Radiation Exposure
Man is exposed to radiation from two major sources:

| Source Category | Examples | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Natural Sources** | **Cosmic Rays** | Originate in outer space; exposure increases with altitude,. |
| | **Terrestrial/Environmental** | Radioactive elements like Thorium, Uranium, Radium, and Potassium-40 ($K^{40}$) in soil and rocks,. |
| | **Internal Radiation** | Radioactive matter stored in body tissues (e.g., $K^{40}$, Carbon-14). |
| **Man-made Sources** | **Medical/Dental** | X-rays and [[Radioisotopes]] (greatest man-made source). |
| | **Occupational** | Radiologists, nuclear plant workers, miners, painters of luminous dials. |
| | **Nuclear** | Radioactive fallout from explosions (Strontium-90, Cesium-137). |
| | **Miscellaneous** | TV sets, luminous wristwatches, airport scanners,. |

### Biological Effects of Radiation
The effects depend on the type of radiation, dose, area exposed, and the tissue involved (lymphocytes and gonads are highly sensitive),.

#### 1. Somatic Effects
Affects the exposed individual directly.
*   **Immediate (Acute) Effects:** occur after high doses over a short period.
    *   **[[Acute Radiation Syndrome]]:** Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, bone marrow depression (leading to infection and bleeding).
    *   **Radiation Sickness:** Occurs at >50 rad; severe blood changes at >150 rad.
    *   **Fatal:** Doses of 400–500 roentgens are fatal in 50% of cases; 600–700 roentgens are fatal in practically every case.
*   **Delayed (Chronic) Effects:** occur after low doses over a long period.
    *   **Malignancy:** [[Leukemia]], skin cancer, lung cancer (uranium miners), bone cancer,.
    *   **Fetal Anomalies:** Microcephaly, malformations.
    *   **Shortening of life**.
    *   **Organ Damage:** Cataracts (lens is sensitive), permanent sterility, aplastic anemia,.

#### 2. Genetic Effects
Affects the offspring/descendants.
*   **Chromosome mutations:** Associated with sterility.
*   **Point mutations:** Affects genes.
*   There is no threshold or "safe dose" for genetic mutations; even small increases place a person at risk.

*   **S** - **S**hortening of life
*   **H** - **H**ereditary (Genetic effects)

### Radiation Units and Permissible Limits
*   **Roentgen (r):** Unit of exposure (amount of radiation absorbed in air).
*   **Rad:** Unit of absorbed dose ($1 \text{ mrad} = 0.001 \text{ rad}$).
*   **Rem:** Product of absorbed dose and modifying factors; indicates potential danger to health.
*   **[[Sievert]] (Sv):** SI unit of dose equivalent ($1 \text{ Sv} = 100 \text{ rem}$).
*   **Becquerel (Bq):** Unit of radioactivity ($1 \text{ Bq} = 1$ disintegration/sec).

**Maximum Permissible Dose (ICRP Guidelines):**
*   **Occupational Workers:** **5 rem per year**,.
*   **General Public:** **0.5 rem per year**.

### Prevention and Control (Radiation Protection)
The International Commission on Radiological Protection ([[ICRP]]) sets safety standards.

#### 1. Protection against External Sources
*   **Shielding:** Use radioprotective material like **Lead** (aprons, gloves, boxes) and concrete walls to enclose sources. Lead aprons (0.5 mm) reduce scattered X-rays by >90%.
*   **Distance:** Intensity varies inversely with the square of the distance (Inverse Square Law). Keep controls distant; use long forceps.
*   **Time (Duration):** Minimize exposure time. Rotate personnel so no single person is exposed for too long.

*   **S** - **S**hielding (Lead/Concrete)
*   **T** - **T**ime (Minimum duration)
*   **D** - **D**istance (Maximum distance)

#### 2. Protection against Internal Entry
*   **Dust Control:** Wet mopping of floors (no dry sweeping) to prevent inhaling radioactive dust.
*   **Ventilation:** Exhaust systems to remove radioactive gas/dust.
*   **Hygiene:** No eating or drinking in workrooms.
*   **PPE:** Use of suitable respirators and protective clothing.

#### 3. Monitoring and Medical Supervision
*   **[[Film Badge]]:** or dosimeters must be worn by workers to measure accumulated exposure,.
*   **Periodic Exams:** Blood counts (for basophilic stippling/leukopenia), medical check-ups every 2 months for exposed workers,.
*   **Pregnancy:** Pregnant women should not work in continuous exposure areas; elective X-rays should be avoided during pregnancy,.

#### 4. Radioactive Waste Disposal
*   **Low Activity:** Discharged into sewers/streams after storage to reduce activity.
*   **High Activity:** Concentrated and stored/buried; liquid part discharged after treatment.
*   **Very High Activity:** Buried deep underground or in concrete-filled drums in the sea.

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Occupational History:** Always ask about occupation (radiologists, miners, nuclear plant workers) in cases of unexplained leukemia, aplastic anemia, or skin lesions,.
*   **Diagnostic Caution:** Unnecessary X-rays, especially in children and pregnant women, must be avoided to prevent developmental anomalies (microcephaly) and future malignancies,.
*   **[[Triage]] in Disasters:** In nuclear disasters, radiation sickness (vomiting, fatigue) helps triage patients. 100-200 rem causes light poisoning; >1000 rem is often fatal.
