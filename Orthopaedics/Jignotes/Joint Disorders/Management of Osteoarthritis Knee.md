# Management of Osteoarthritis Knee (HTO vs TKR)

Management of [[osteoarthritis]] (OA) of the [[knee]] is a graded approach starting with conservative measures. When non-operative methods (lifestyle modification, [[NSAIDs]], [[physiotherapy]], [[intra-articular injections]]) fail to control pain or disability, surgical intervention is indicated. The two primary surgical options for distinct patient populations are [[High Tibial Osteotomy]] (HTO) and [[Total Knee Replacement]] (TKR).

## 1. General Indications for Surgery
Operative management is considered when:
*   Conservative treatment fails to relieve symptoms.
*   Pain is severe and interferes with daily activities (e.g., walking, getting up from chairs).
*   There is significant [[joint deformity]] or [[instability]].
*   There is progressive limitation of movement.

## 2. High Tibial Osteotomy (HTO)

### Principle
[[High Tibial Osteotomy]] is a joint-preserving surgery designed to realign the mechanical axis of the lower limb. In the common scenario of medial compartment OA with [[genu varum]] (bow legs), the procedure corrects the deformity to shift the weight-bearing load from the damaged medial compartment to the healthy lateral compartment.

### Indications
*   **Age:** Young and active patients (typically < 60 years).
*   **Disease Extent:** Isolated **unicompartmental osteoarthritis** (usually medial compartment).
*   **Deformity:** [[Genu varum]] (bow leg) deformity that is not too severe.
*   **Range of Motion:** Good range of motion should be present (at least 90 degrees flexion).
*   **Ligaments:** Stable [[knee ligaments]] (no major instability).

### Types of Osteotomy
1.  **Closing Wedge Osteotomy:** A wedge of bone is removed from the lateral side of the [[proximal tibia]] to correct the alignment. This slightly shortens the bone.
2.  **Opening Wedge Osteotomy:** A cut is made on the medial side, and the bone is levered open. A bone graft or wedge is inserted to maintain the correction. This slightly lengthens the bone.
3.  **Dome Osteotomy:** A curved cut is made, and the segment is rotated to achieve angular correction. This has a "neutral" effect on length.

### Procedure Highlights
*   **Preoperative Planning:** Essential to calculate the exact size of the wedge and the degree of angular correction required.
*   **Fixation:** The bone segments are fixed in the new position using [[plates and screws]] or [[blade-plates]].
*   **Outcome:** Relieves pain by redirecting load trajectories. It "buys time" for the natural knee before a replacement might be needed in the future.

## 3. Total Knee Replacement (TKR) / Arthroplasty

### Principle
[[Total Knee Replacement]] is a resurfacing operation where the damaged articular surfaces of the [[femur]] and [[tibia]] are removed and replaced with artificial components (prostheses) to restore joint function and alignment.

### Indications
*   **Age:** Typically elderly patients (> 60 years). Relative contraindication in young patients due to the finite lifespan of the implant.
*   **Disease Extent:** **Tricompartmental osteoarthritis** (involvement of medial, lateral, and patellofemoral compartments) or advanced unicompartmental disease.
*   **Symptoms:** Severe pain (including night pain), severe functional limitation, and fixed deformities.
*   **Deformity:** Fixed [[genu varum]] or [[genu valgum]] that is not correctable by manual stress.

### Components of TKR
1.  **Femoral Component:** A U-shaped metal cap that resurfaces the prepared distal [[femur]].
2.  **Tibial Base Plate:** A metal plate covering the cut surface of the proximal [[tibia]].
3.  **Plastic Spacer:** A high-density [[polyethylene]] tray inserted between the metal components to act as the new articular surface.
4.  **Patellar Button:** A polyethylene button used to resurface the damaged [[patella]] (optional depending on surgeon preference and disease severity).

### Contraindications
*   **Absolute:** Active [[sepsis]] (infection) in the knee or systemic infection, [[neuropathic joint]] (Charcot joint), non-functional [[extensor mechanism]] (quadriceps).
*   **Relative:** Young age, severe [[obesity]].

### Complications
*   **Infection:** A disastrous complication requiring implant removal.
*   **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT):** Prophylaxis is crucial.
*   **Loosening:** Aseptic loosening over time.
*   **Periprosthetic Fracture:** Fracture around the implant.
*   **Neurovascular Injury:** Rare.

## 4. Comparison: HTO vs. TKR

| Feature | [[High Tibial Osteotomy]] (HTO) | [[Total Knee Replacement]] (TKR) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Goal** | Re-alignment / Unloading diseased compartment | Resurfacing / Replacing joint surfaces |
| **Patient Age** | Young, active (< 60 years) | Elderly (> 60 years) |
| **Activity Level** | High demand / Heavy labor possible | Moderate / Low demand (avoid high impact) |
| **Disease Involvement** | Unicompartmental (Medial) | Tricompartmental / Pan-articular |
| **Deformity** | Varus (Correctable) | Fixed Varus/Valgus/Flexion |
| **Ligament Status** | Must be intact (Stable knee) | Can compensate for some instability (Cruciate sacrificing) |
| **Nature of Surgery** | Joint Preserving | Joint Sacrificing |
| **Recovery** | Slower (bone healing required) | Faster mobilization |
| **Longevity** | Temporary (Buys time, 7-10 years) | Definitive (15-20 years) |

### Clinical Implications: The "Standing" Test
To decide between HTO and TKR clinically, examine the patient standing from the front:
1.  **Deformity:** Observe if the knee cannot straighten fully (flexion deformity) or has [[varus]]/[[valgus]].
2.  **Stress Test:** Apply manual stress to the deformity.
    *   **Correctable:** If the deformity can be corrected by manual stress, it indicates **unilateral osteoarthritis** (usually medial) and potential suitability for **HTO**.
    *   **Not Correctable:** If the deformity is fixed and not correctable, it indicates advanced disease and usually requires **TKR**.
