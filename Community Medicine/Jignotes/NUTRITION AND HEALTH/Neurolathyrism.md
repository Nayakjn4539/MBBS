# Neurolathyrism

[[Neurolathyrism]] is a crippling disease of the nervous system characterized by gradually developing **spastic paralysis** of the lower limbs. It is a nutritional disorder resulting from the excessive consumption of the pulse **Lathyrus sativus**.

### 1. Epidemiological Determinants

*   **Agent:** *Lathyrus sativus* (Common names: [[Khesari Dal]], Teora dal, Lak dal).
    *   It is a hardy crop that survives drought and famine conditions, making it a staple for the poor during times of scarcity.
    *   The seeds are triangular and grey; when dehusked, they resemble Red gram or Bengal gram.
*   **Toxin:** [[Beta-Oxalyl-Amino-Alanine (BOAA)]].
    *   It is a **neurotoxin**.
    *   It is **water-soluble** (a property utilized in prevention).
    *   It interferes with the neurotransmitter glutamate.
*   **Host:** Usually affects active young men between **15–45 years** of age.
*   **Dose:** Consumption of diet containing **>30%** Lathyrus sativus for a period of **2–6 months** triggers the disease.

> **Note:** Lathyrism in humans is **Neurolathyrism** (nervous system). In animals, it is **Osteolathyrism** or **Odoratism** (skeletal deformities).

### 2. Clinical Stages of Neurolathyrism

The disease is progressive and irreversible. The stages are classified based on the severity of motor disability:

| Stage | Name | Clinical Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I** | **Latent Stage** | Patient appears healthy but exhibits an ungainly gait when subjected to physical stress. |
| **II** | **No-Stick Stage** | Patient walks with short, jerky steps without the aid of a stick. |
| **III** | **One-Stick Stage** | Patient walks with a crossed gait (scissor gait), tends to walk on toes, and has muscular stiffness. Needs one stick for balance. |
| **IV** | **Two-Stick Stage** | Severe symptoms; excessive knee bending and crossed legs. Needs two crutches for support. Slow and clumsy gait. |
| **V** | **Crawler Stage** | Erect posture becomes impossible due to knee joint instability and muscle atrophy. Patient is reduced to crawling on hands. |

### 3. Prevention and Control

Interventions can be applied at various levels:

#### A. Medical Measures
*   **[[Vitamin C Prophylaxis]]:** Daily administration of **500–1000 mg** of ascorbic acid. It can prevent damage even if the lathyrogenic diet is continued.
*   **Withdrawal:** Stopping the consumption of the pulse at the **Latent Stage** can result in complete remission.

#### B. Toxin Removal (Detoxification)
Since the toxin [[BOAA]] is water-soluble, it can be removed by household or industrial methods:
1.  **Steeping Method:**
    *   Soak the pulse in hot water for **2 hours**.
    *   Drain the soak water completely (toxin is leached out).
    *   Wash with clean water and dry in the sun.
    *   *Drawback:* Loss of water-soluble vitamins and minerals.
2.  **Parboiling:**
    *   Soak the pulse in **lime water** overnight.
    *   Boil the pulse.
    *   This destroys the toxin and is suitable for large-scale operations (like rice parboiling).

#### C. Other Measures
*   **Banning the Crop:** The Prevention of Food Adulteration Act has banned the sale of *Lathyrus sativus*, but enforcement is difficult in endemic poverty-stricken areas.
*   **Genetic Approach:** Cultivation of low-toxin varieties (strains with very low BOAA content) developed by agricultural institutes.
*   **Education:** Advising that Khesari dal should not form more than **25%** of the total diet.

### 4. Clinical Relevance
*   **History Taking:** In patients presenting with spastic paraplegia, especially young males from endemic belts (MP, UP, Bihar), always ask about dietary staples and the consumption of Khesari dal during drought years.
*   **Differential Diagnosis:** Differentiate from other causes of spastic paralysis like hereditary spastic paraparesis or spinal cord compression.
