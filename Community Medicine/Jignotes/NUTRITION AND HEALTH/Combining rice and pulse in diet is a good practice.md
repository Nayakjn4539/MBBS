# [[NUTRITION AND HEALTH]] > Combining rice and pulse in diet is a good practice

### Combining Rice and Pulse: The Science of Mutual Supplementation

Combining rice (cereal) and pulse (legume) in the diet is considered a good practice due to the **Supplementary Action of Proteins**. While individual plant proteins are often incomplete, combining them corrects their specific amino acid deficits, improving the overall [[Protein Quality]].

#### 1. Concept of Limiting Amino Acids
Proteins are made of amino acids. **[[Essential Amino Acids]]** cannot be synthesized by the body and must be derived from food. Plant proteins generally lack one or more essential amino acids, which are termed "limiting amino acids."

*   **Cereals (e.g., Rice, Wheat):**
    *   **Deficient in:** [[Lysine]] and Threonine.
    *   **Rich in:** Methionine.
*   **Pulses (e.g., Dal, Grams):**
    *   **Deficient in:** [[Methionine]] and Cysteine (Sulphur-containing amino acids).
    *   **Rich in:** Lysine.

#### 2. Supplementary Action of Proteins
When rice and pulses are consumed together (e.g., *Dal-Chawal*, *Khichdi*, *Idli*), the protein quality improves significantly because:
*   The **Lysine** from pulses supplements the deficiency in rice.
*   The **Methionine** from rice supplements the deficiency in pulses.

This mutual supplementation results in a protein mixture that is **[[Biologically Complete]]**, comparable to Grade-1 animal proteins (like milk or eggs) in terms of [[Net Protein Utilization]] (NPU).

#### 3. Nutritional Comparison Table

| Food Group | Limiting Amino Acid (Deficient) | Abundant Amino Acid | Result of Combination |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cereals (Rice)** | **[[Lysine]]**, Threonine | Methionine | **High Biological Value** <br> (Complete Protein Profile) |
| **Pulses (Dal)** | **[[Methionine]]**, Cysteine | Lysine | |

#### 4. Ideal Ratio
For optimal protein quality, the recommended Cereal:Pulse ratio ranges from **3:1 to 5:1**.
*   **Examples:** *Idli, Dosa, Pongal, Khichdi*.
*   This ratio ensures the maximum utilization of proteins for body building and repair.

#### 5. Mnemonic
To remember which amino acid is missing:
*   **C**ereals **L**ack **L**ysine (**C-L-L**)
*   **P**ulses **M**iss **M**ethionine (**P-M-M**)

#### 6. Clinical & Public Health Relevance
*   **Vegetarian Diet:** Since Indian diets are predominantly vegetarian, this combination is crucial for preventing **[[Protein Energy Malnutrition]]** (PEM) without relying on expensive animal proteins.
*   **Cost-Effective:** It provides high-quality protein at a low cost ("Poor man’s meat").
*   **Public Health Programs:** This principle is applied in the **[[Mid-day Meal Programme]]** and **[[ICDS]]**, where 'Khichdi' or rice-dal combinations are served to ensure children receive adequate nutrition.
