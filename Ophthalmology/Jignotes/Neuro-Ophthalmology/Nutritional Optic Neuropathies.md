# Nutritional Optic Neuropathies

[[Nutritional Optic Neuropathy]], often discussed in conjunction with [[Toxic Optic Neuropathy]], represents a group of disorders characterized by damage to the [[optic nerve]] due to nutritional deficiencies or the toxic effects of certain substances, which are often exacerbated by malnutrition.

### Overview
*   **Definition:** It is essentially a form of **chronic retrobulbar neuritis** resulting in visual loss due to damage to the [[optic nerve fibers]], specifically the [[papillomacular bundle]].
*   **Nature:** The condition is typically **bilateral**, symmetric, painless, and progressive.,
*   **Historical Terminology:** Previously termed "toxic amblyopia," which is now considered a misnomer; "nutritional optic neuropathy" is preferred as the underlying mechanism is often a deficiency of essential nutrients.,

### Etiology and Risk Factors
The condition arises from a deficiency of vitamins essential for mitochondrial function and axonal transport, often combined with exposure to toxins.

1.  **Nutritional Deficiencies:**
    *   **Vitamin B1 ([[Thiamine]]):** Deficiency leads to [[Wernicke's encephalopathy]] and axial optic neuritis.
    *   **Vitamin B12 ([[Cyanocobalamin]]):** Associated with [[pernicious anemia]], strict vegan diets, or malabsorption.
    *   **Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)**, **Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)**, and **Folic Acid**.
    *   **Proteins:** General malnutrition and deficiency of sulphur-rich proteins.

2.  **Toxic-Nutritional Causes:**
    *   **Tobacco-Alcohol Amblyopia:** The most common form, typically seen in chronic alcoholics and heavy smokers (pipe/cigar) who have poor dietary intake.,

### Pathogenesis
The common pathway involves **mitochondrial dysfunction** leading to ATP depletion.
*   **Mitochondrial Stress:** Neurons with long, thin, or unmyelinated axons (like the [[papillomacular bundle]]) are highly susceptible to metabolic stress and decreased ATP production.
*   **Tobacco Mechanism:** Tobacco smoke contains **cyanide**. In healthy individuals, cyanide is detoxified by thiosulphate (derived from dietary sulphur-rich proteins) and [[Vitamin B12]] to form thiocyanate.
*   **Deficiency Impact:** In malnourished alcoholics/smokers, the deficiency of Vitamin B12 and sulphur-rich proteins leads to accumulation of cyanide in the blood, causing degeneration of [[ganglion cells]] (especially in the [[macula]]) and the [[papillomacular bundle]] in the optic nerve.,

### Clinical Features
*   **Demographics:** Typically affects males between **40 and 60 years** of age.
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Visual Loss:** Gradual, progressive, painless, and **bilateral** impairment of central vision.,
    *   **Fogginess:** Patients complain of "fogginess" or mistiness of vision.
    *   **Day Blindness ([[Hemeralopia]]):** Vision is often reported to be better in dim light (evening) than in bright light.
    *   **Difficulty in Near Work:** Difficulty reading or doing close work is a common early complaint.
    *   **Dyschromatopsia:** Impairment of color vision, particularly for **Red and Green**.,

### Signs and Examination Findings

| **Examination** | **Findings** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Visual Acuity** | Reduced (ranges from 6/12 to 6/60), usually bilateral and symmetric., |
| **Pupils** | Usually normal; in severe cases, may be sluggish., |
| **Fundoscopy** | **Early Stage:** Usually **Normal** optic disc.,<br>**Late Stage:** **Temporal pallor** of the [[optic disc]] (due to atrophy of the [[papillomacular bundle]]).,, |
| **Visual Fields** | **Centrocaecal Scotoma**: A defect extending from the fixation point (central) to the [[blind spot]] (caecal).,<br>The defect is typically **red > white** (easier to detect with a red target). |

### Specific Clinical Entity: Tobacco-Alcohol Amblyopia
*   **Population:** Heavy drinkers and pipe/cigar smokers with poor diet.
*   **Mechanism:** Synergistic effect of alcohol (causing B-vitamin deficiency via malabsorption/poor diet) and tobacco (cyanide toxicity).
*   **Diagnosis:** Based on history of substance use, bilateral visual loss, and characteristic field defects (centrocaecal scotoma).
*   **Differential Diagnosis:**
    *   [[Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy]] (LHON): Usually acute/subacute, sequential eye involvement, microangiopathy on the disc.
    *   [[Toxic Optic Neuropathy]] (Drug-induced): Ethambutol, Isoniazid, etc.
    *   Compressive lesions (e.g., [[Pituitary Adenoma]]): Causes bitemporal hemianopia.

### Management

**Clinical Implication:** Early diagnosis is crucial because the condition is reversible in the early stages but leads to permanent [[optic atrophy]] if untreated.

1.  **Cessation of Toxins:**
    *   Total abstinence from **tobacco** and **alcohol** is the most critical step.,

2.  **Nutritional Supplementation:**
    *   **Vitamin B12 ([[Hydroxocobalamin]]):**
        *   **Dose:** 1000 $\mu g$ intramuscularly.
        *   **Regimen:** Weekly for 10 weeks (Marrow) or daily/weekly courses (Khurana/Parsons).,,
        *   *Rationale:* Hydroxocobalamin helps detoxify cyanide into cyanocobalamin, which is then excreted.
    *   **Oral Vitamins:** Thiamine (100 mg BD) and Folic acid/Folate.,
    *   **Diet:** High-protein diet rich in Vitamin B-complex.

3.  **General Measures:**
    *   Improvement of general health and nutrition.
    *   Vasodilators (limited evidence).

### Prognosis
*   **Good:** If diagnosed early and compliance with abstinence and supplements is maintained. Visual recovery is slow and may take weeks to months.,
*   **Poor:** In chronic cases where **optic atrophy** has already set in.,

### Mnemonics
**"DICE"** (Common causes of Toxic/Nutritional Neuropathy - though mainly drugs, easy to remember the group):
*   **D** - [[Digoxin]]
*   **I** - [[Isoniazid]]
*   **C** - [[Chloroquine]]
*   **E** - [[Ethambutol]] (plus **Ethanol** for nutritional)

**"Central See-Saw"**
*   **Central** vision loss
*   **C**entrocaecal **S**cotoma (See-Saw)
