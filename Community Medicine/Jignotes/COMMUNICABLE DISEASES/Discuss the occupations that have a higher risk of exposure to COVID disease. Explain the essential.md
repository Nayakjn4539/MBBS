# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Discuss the occupations that have a higher risk of exposure to COVID disease. Explain the essential measures of prevention undertaken to protect them.

### High-Risk Occupations for COVID-19 Exposure

Certain occupational groups face a significantly elevated risk of acquiring [[COVID-19]] due to the nature of their work, proximity to infected individuals, and exposure to infectious materials.

**1. Health Care Workers (HCWs)**
This constitutes the highest risk group. It includes doctors, nurses, laboratory technicians, and paramedics.
*   **Risk Factors:** Direct care of COVID-19 patients, handling biological samples, and performing **Aerosol-Generating Procedures** (e.g., endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, nebulization, suctioning).
*   **Surveillance Data:** Health care workers accounted for a significant percentage of cases, especially those involved in aerosol-generating procedures.

**2. Sanitation and Waste Management Workers**
*   **Risk Factors:** Handling, transport, and disposal of potentially infectious biomedical waste, cleaning isolation wards, and managing dead bodies.
*   **Specific Exposure:** Contact with contaminated linens, surfaces, and waste bags from isolation wards or quarantine centers.

**3. Frontline Workers**
This category includes police personnel, home guards, municipal workers, and armed forces.
*   **Risk Factors:** Managing containment zones, enforcing lockdowns, and high interaction with the general public during active surveillance duties.

**4. Laboratory Personnel**
*   **Risk Factors:** Handling live SARS-CoV-2 virus or processing clinical specimens (swabs, blood, body fluids) for testing.

### Essential Measures of Prevention

Protection involves a combination of engineering controls, administrative controls, and [[Personal Protective Equipment]] (PPE).

#### 1. Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) for Health Care Workers
*   **Standard Precautions:** Must be applied to *all* patients. This includes hand hygiene, use of gloves, and respiratory hygiene.
*   **Droplet and Contact Precautions:** For routine care of suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients.
*   **Airborne Precautions:** Specifically required during **Aerosol-Generating Procedures**.
    *   **PPE:** Use of particulate respirators ([[N95 masks]] or FFP2), eye protection (goggles/face shields), gowns, and gloves.
    *   **Ventilation:** Procedures should be performed in adequately ventilated rooms (natural or mechanical).
*   **Hand Hygiene:** Strict adherence to hand washing with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub is critical after every contact.

#### 2. Biomedical Waste Management (COVID-19 Context)
Safe handling of waste is crucial to protect sanitation staff.
*   **Double Layering:** Waste from COVID-19 isolation wards must be collected in **double-layered bags** (using 2 bags) to ensure strength and prevent leaks.
*   **Labeling:** Bags should be explicitly labeled as **"COVID-19 Waste"**.
*   **Bin Safety:** Use bins with **foot-operated lids** to avoid hand contact.
*   **PPE for Handlers:** Sanitation workers must wear disposable rubber boots, heavy-duty gloves, and triple-layer masks,.

#### 3. Environmental Cleaning and Disinfection
Proper disinfection of workplaces (offices, hospitals, public spaces) breaks the chain of transmission via [[fomites]].

| Surface Type | Recommended Disinfectant | Application Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Non-metallic surfaces** (Floors, walls) | **1% Sodium Hypochlorite** | Must be freshly prepared. |
| **Metallic surfaces** (Door handles, keys) | **70% Alcohol** | Bleach causes corrosion on metals. |
| **Toilet surfaces** | **1% Sodium Hypochlorite** | Avoid sprays to prevent splashing; wipe down. |

*   **Frequency:** High-touch surfaces (doorknobs, railings) should be cleaned frequently (e.g., every evening or morning).

#### 4. Vaccination
*   **Priority Strategy:** Health care workers and frontline workers were prioritized as the first group for [[COVID-19 Vaccination]] to sustain essential health services and reduce mortality.
*   **Advisory:** Even after vaccination, COVID-appropriate behavior (masking, distancing) must continue.

#### 5. General Preventive Measures (The "New Normal")
*   **Social Distancing:** Maintaining a distance of at least **1 meter** (preferably 6 feet),.
*   **Respiratory Etiquette:** Covering mouth and nose during coughing/sneezing; proper disposal of tissues.
*   **Workplace Modifications:** Cleaning work areas with disinfecting wipes before use and sitting one seat further away from others in offices.

### Clinical Relevance: Disinfection Protocols
**Mnemonic for Disinfection: "Metal gets Spirit, Floor gets Bleach"**
*   **Metal:** 70% Alcohol (Spirit) is used because bleach corrodes metal.
*   **Floor/General:** 1% Sodium Hypochlorite (Bleach) is the standard for non-porous surfaces.
*   *Note:* Always prepare 1% hypochlorite solution **freshly** for efficacy.
