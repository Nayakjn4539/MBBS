# [[Thyroid Gland]] > Papillary Carcinoma

# [[Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma]] (PTC)

## 1. Introduction and Epidemiology
*   **Incidence:** It is the **most common** malignant neoplasm of the [[thyroid gland]], accounting for approximately 60–80% of all thyroid malignancies.
*   **Age and Sex:**
    *   Occurs in all age groups but peak incidence is in the 3rd and 4th decades.
    *   It is the **only** thyroid cancer common in children.
    *   **Female predominance** is observed (Female:Male ratio of 3:1).
*   **Prognosis:** Generally excellent. It is a slow-growing tumor. Even with lymph node metastasis, the prognosis remains favorable, especially in younger patients.

## 2. Etiology and Risk Factors
*   **Ionizing Radiation:** Exposure to radiation, especially during childhood (head and neck irradiation), is a major risk factor.
*   **Genetics:**
    *   **RET proto-oncogene** rearrangements (RET/PTC).
    *   **BRAF mutations** are common.
    *   Familial syndromes: [[Gardner's syndrome]] (familial colonic polyposis), [[Cowden syndrome]].
*   **Dietary Iodine:** Paradoxically, PTC is more common in areas with **high/adequate iodine intake**, whereas follicular carcinoma is more common in iodine-deficient areas.
*   **Hormonal Factors:** Increased risk in nulliparous women or those with early menarche.

## 3. Pathology
### A. Gross Appearance
*   Usually presents as a hard, whitish, invasive neoplasm with ill-defined margins.
*   Cut surface may appear granular.
*   **Multicentricity:** It is frequently multicentric (involves both lobes), seen in up to 80% of cases. This may be due to intrathyroidal lymphatic spread or true de novo multifocality.
*   Can be cystic (large tumors may undergo cystic degeneration).

### B. Microscopic Features
Diagnosis relies on characteristic **nuclear features** rather than architectural pattern.
*   **Papillae:** Branching papillae with a fibrovascular stalk covered by single to multiple layers of cuboidal epithelial cells.
*   **[[Orphan Annie Eye Nuclei]]:** Nuclei are large, crowded, and overlapping with a clear, empty-appearing nucleoplasm (ground-glass appearance).
*   **Nuclear Grooves:** Longitudinal folding of the nuclear membrane (coffee-bean appearance).
*   **[[Psammoma Bodies]]:** Concentric, laminated, calcified structures. Found in 40–50% of cases. Their presence in a lymph node or thyroid suggests PTC.

> **Mnemonic for Microscopic Features:** **P**apillary **P**opular **P**sammoma **P**ale nuclei (Orphan Annie).

### C. Variants
*   **Follicular Variant:** Has a follicular growth pattern but nuclei typical of PTC.
*   **Encapsulated Variant:** Surrounded by a fibrous capsule; better prognosis.
*   **Occult PTC (Microcarcinoma):** Tumor ≤ 1.0 cm or ≤ 1.5 cm; often incidental; excellent prognosis.
*   **Aggressive Variants (Poor Prognosis):**
    *   Tall cell variant.
    *   Columnar cell variant.
    *   Diffuse sclerosing variant.

## 4. Patterns of Spread
1.  **Lymphatic Spread:** PTC is **lymphotropic**.
    *   Spreads primarily to regional [[cervical lymph nodes]].
    *   **Central compartment (Level VI)** nodes are involved first, followed by lateral neck nodes (Levels II, III, IV).
    *   Palpable nodal metastasis is the initial presentation in ~33% of patients.
    *   *Clinical Implication:* "Lateral aberrant thyroid" is a misnomer; it actually represents metastatic PTC in a cervical lymph node from an occult primary.
2.  **Local Spread:** Can invade strap muscles, trachea (causing hemoptysis/dyspnea), esophagus (dysphagia), and recurrent laryngeal nerve (hoarseness).
3.  **Hematogenous Spread:** Less common than in follicular carcinoma. Occurs late to **Lungs** (most common) and Bones.

## 5. Clinical Features
*   **Solitary Thyroid Nodule:** Most common presentation. Usually painless, firm/hard, and moves with deglutition.
*   **Cervical Lymphadenopathy:** Enlarged lymph nodes in the lateral neck (may be cystic).
*   **Incidental Finding:** Discovered during imaging for other reasons or pathology of thyroidectomy for benign disease.
*   **Advanced Symptoms:** Hoarseness, stridor, or dysphagia indicate local invasion.

## 6. Diagnostic Evaluation
*   **[[Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology]] (FNAC):**
    *   **Investigation of Choice.**
    *   Diagnostic accuracy is high. Shows Orphan Annie nuclei, nuclear grooves, and psammoma bodies.
*   **[[Ultrasound Neck]]:**
    *   Differentiates solid vs. cystic.
    *   **Malignant features:** Hypoechogenicity, irregular margins, microcalcifications (psammoma bodies), absent halo sign, taller-than-wide shape.
    *   Evaluates cervical lymph nodes for metastasis.
*   **Thyroid Function Tests:** Usually normal (euthyroid).
*   **CT/MRI:** Used to assess retrosternal extension or invasion into trachea/esophagus in large fixed tumors.

## 7. Staging (TNM)
Unique aspect: **Age** is a major prognostic factor in staging.
*   **Older Classification:** Cut-off age 45 years.
*   **Newer Classification (UICC 2016/AJCC 8th Ed):** Cut-off age **55 years**.

| Feature | Patient Age < 55 Years | Patient Age ≥ 55 Years |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stage I** | Any T, Any N, **M0** (No distant mets) | T1, N0, M0 |
| **Stage II** | Any T, Any N, **M1** (Distant mets present) | T2, N0, M0 |
| **Stage III** | -- | T3, N0, M0; T1–3, N1, M0 |
| **Stage IV** | -- | T4 or M1 disease |

*Note: Patients <55 years have only Stage I or II. Stage III and IV do not exist for this age group unless anaplastic features develop.*

## 8. Management
Treatment involves a multidisciplinary approach: Surgery + Radioiodine + TSH Suppression.

### A. Surgical Management
Surgery is the mainstay of treatment.
1.  **Hemithyroidectomy (Lobectomy + Isthmusectomy):**
    *   Indicated for **Low-Risk** patients:
        *   Age < 45/55 years.
        *   Tumor size < 1.5 cm (or < 1 cm microcarcinoma).
        *   Unilateral, intrathyroidal lesion.
        *   No history of radiation or family history.
2.  **[[Total Thyroidectomy]]:**
    *   Indicated for **High-Risk** patients:
        *   Age > 45/55 years.
        *   Tumor size > 1.5 cm.
        *   Bilateral disease.
        *   Extrathyroidal extension.
        *   Distant metastasis.
        *   History of neck irradiation.
3.  **Neck Dissection:**
    *   **Therapeutic Neck Dissection:** If nodes are clinically or radiologically palpable (N+). Modified Radical Neck Dissection (MRND) or Selective Neck Dissection (levels II–V) is done.
    *   **Elective/Prophylactic Central Node Dissection (Level VI):** Often performed with total thyroidectomy because micrometastases are common in the central compartment. Radical neck dissection is rarely needed unless extensive infiltration is present.

### B. Post-operative [[Radioactive Iodine]] (RAI - I-131) Ablation
*   **Purpose:** To destroy any residual microscopic thyroid tissue or occult metastases after Total Thyroidectomy.
*   **Rationale:** Allows for the use of **Thyroglobulin** as a tumor marker during follow-up (since normal thyroid tissue is gone).
*   **Indications:**
    *   Large tumors (>1.5–2 cm).
    *   Extrathyroidal extension.
    *   Distant metastases.
    *   Unfavorable histology.
*   **Prerequisite:** High TSH levels (>30 µU/ml) are needed to drive iodine into cells. Achieved by withdrawing Thyroxine for 4–6 weeks or giving Recombinant Human TSH.

### C. TSH Suppression Therapy
*   **Mechanism:** PTC is TSH-dependent. High TSH stimulates growth.
*   **Protocol:** Lifelong Levo-thyroxine is given to keep TSH levels low (suppressed).
    *   High risk: TSH < 0.1 mU/L.
    *   Low risk: TSH 0.1–0.5 mU/L.

## 9. Follow-up
*   **[[Serum Thyroglobulin]] (Tg):** It is a specific tumor marker for differentiated thyroid cancer (PTC and Follicular) after total thyroidectomy.
    *   Levels should be undetectable. Rising levels indicate recurrence.
*   **Whole Body Iodine Scan:** To detect recurrence/metastasis.
*   **Neck Ultrasound:** To check for bed recurrence or nodes.
