# Fibromyalgia

### Definition
[[Fibromyalgia]] is not so much a specific diagnosis as a descriptive term for a clinical syndrome characterized by widespread pain and tenderness in the [[muscles]] and soft tissues. It is a widespread disease affecting both sides of the body, both above and below the waist, lasting for more than 3 months.

*   **Key Characteristic:** There is a complete absence of demonstrable pathological changes in the affected tissues.
*   **Nature:** It falls in the ambit of [[muscular endurance]] disorders.
*   **Distinction:** It is a distinct entity from [[fibrositis]], which is a localized disorder.

### Etiology and Risk Factors
The exact etiology is unknown, but several factors are implicated:
*   **Sleep Disorders:** Loss of Stage IV delta wave sleep is a significant trigger.
*   **Genetics:** Hereditary factors may play a role in 5–10% of cases.
*   **Psychological Factors:** A significant number of patients develop psychological [[depression]] and [[anxiety]].
*   **Trauma:** Can be triggered by trauma or accidents (sometimes trivial injuries).
*   **Associated Conditions:** Connective tissue disorders and infections may lower muscle endurance, triggering the condition.
*   **Fatigue Syndrome:** It is proposed to be a part of [[chronic fatigue syndrome]].

### Clinical Features
The symptoms are often described as "Charley horses" scattered all over the body.

#### 1. Pain
*   **Nature:** Widespread gnawing pains.
*   **Distribution:** Affects muscles and soft tissues around the back of the neck, shoulders, lower back, and upper parts of the buttocks.
*   **Aggravating Factors:** Increased activity, stress, or poor sleep.

#### 2. Associated Symptoms
*   **Fatigue:** Generalized tiredness is common.
*   **Stiffness:** Often present.
*   **Arthralgia:** Joint pain without arthritis.
*   **Visceral Symptoms:** [[Irritable bowel syndrome]], [[dysmenorrhea]], headache, chest and abdominal pains.

### Diagnostic Criteria
Diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on criteria put forward by the **American College of Rheumatology (1990)**:

1.  **Widespread Pain:** History of widespread pain involving all four quadrants of the body (right and left sides, above and below the waist) for at least **3 months**.
2.  **Tender Points:** Pain elicited in at least **11 out of 18** designated "tender points" on physical examination when a digital pressure of 4 kg is applied.

### Differential Diagnosis
Before confirming [[fibromyalgia]], other organic conditions must be ruled out through careful investigation:
*   [[Hypothyroidism]]
*   [[Systemic Lupus Erythematosus]] (SLE)
*   [[Hyperparathyroidism]]
*   [[Osteomalacia]]

### Management
A multidisciplinary approach is the most effective strategy.

#### 1. General Measures and Counseling
*   **Patient Counseling:** Essential to validate the patient's complaints despite the absence of pathology.
*   **Avoidance of Aggravating Factors:** Stress reduction and lifestyle modification.
*   **Diet:** A diet rich in protein, amino acids, and minerals is recommended.

#### 2. Physical Therapy
*   **Myofascial Release:** Massage and physical therapy to relieve pain at tender areas.
*   **Exercise:** Aerobic exercises are advocated to improve muscle endurance.

#### 3. Medical Management
*   **Antidepressants:** Often used to manage associated depression/anxiety and improve sleep.
*   **Analgesics:** For pain relief (though often limited efficacy).
*   **Injection Therapy:** Trigger point injections into tender areas using dry needling, normal saline, local anesthetic, or [[corticosteroids]].

**Clinical Implication:**
It is often difficult to give credence to the patient's complaints due to the lack of pathological signs. Clinicians must avoid the trap of dismissing the patient, as the "illness behavior" can be self-perpetuating. Proper support and exclusion of organic pathology are vital.
