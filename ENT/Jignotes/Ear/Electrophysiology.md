# Electrophysiology of the Ear

The physiology of hearing involves complex bio-electrical events. The ear converts mechanical energy (sound waves) into electrical impulses (transduction) which are then transmitted to the brain. This process relies on specific electrical potentials generated within the cochlea and the neural pathways.

## I. Electrical Potentials of the Cochlea

There are four types of potentials recorded from the cochlea: one resting potential and three stimulus-related potentials.

### 1. Resting Potentials (No Stimulus Required)

*   **[[Endocochlear Potential]] (EP)**
    *   This is a direct current (DC) potential.
    *   **Location:** Recorded from the [[scala media]] (endolymphatic space).
    *   **Voltage:** It has a highly positive potential of **+80 mV**,.
    *   **Source:** Generated by the [[stria vascularis]] using the $Na^+/K^+$-ATPase pump.
    *   **Mechanism:** The [[endolymph]] has a high $K^+$ concentration (similar to intracellular fluid) and low $Na^+$. This creates a strong electrochemical gradient compared to the [[perilymph]] (0 mV) and the intracellular potential of hair cells (approx -70 mV).
    *   **Function:** Acts as a "battery" to drive current through hair cells during transduction,.
    *   **Clinical Significance:** It is dependent on oxygen supply; hypoxia reduces EP.

*   **Intracellular Potential:**
    *   The interior of the hair cells is negative relative to the perilymph (approx -40 to -70 mV). The huge potential difference between the endolymph (+80 mV) and the hair cell interior (~-70 mV) creates a gradient of ~150 mV, facilitating rapid ion influx.

### 2. Stimulus-Related Potentials (Evoked Potentials)

These occur only when sound stimulation is present.

| Potential Type | Nature | Source | Characteristics | Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Cochlear Microphonics]] (CM)** | Alternating Current (AC) | Primarily [[Outer Hair Cells]] (OHCs) | • Mirrors the waveform of the sound stimulus.<br>• No latency.<br>• No refractory period.<br>• Graded response (not all-or-none),. | • Absent in areas where OHCs are damaged.<br>• Used in [[Electrocochleography]]. |
| **[[Summating Potential]] (SP)** | Direct Current (DC) | Primarily [[Inner Hair Cells]] (IHCs) (some OHC contribution) | • Follows the "envelope" of the sound, not the waveform.<br>• Does not fatigue.<br>• A rectified derivative of the sound signal,. | • **Crucial for [[Meniere's Disease]]**: In endolymphatic hydrops, the SP becomes enlarged relative to the AP,. |
| **[[Action Potential]] (AP)** | All-or-none response | Distal [[Auditory Nerve]] (CN VIII) | • Represents synchronous firing of nerve fibers.<br>• Has a latency.<br>• Has a refractory period. | • Corresponds to **Wave I** of [[BERA]].<br>• Used to calculate SP/AP ratio. |

## II. Mechanism of Transduction

Transduction is the conversion of mechanical energy into electrical energy.

1.  **Mechanical Movement:** Sound waves cause the [[stapes footplate]] to move, creating pressure waves in the perilymph (scala vestibuli $\rightarrow$ scala tympani).
2.  **Basilar Membrane Displacement:** The pressure wave displaces the [[basilar membrane]] (traveling wave).
3.  **Shearing Force:** The [[Organ of Corti]] moves. The [[stereocilia]] of the hair cells are embedded in or touch the [[tectorial membrane]]. The differential movement creates a shearing force,.
4.  **Depolarization:**
    *   Stereocilia bend towards the **kinocilium** (or the tallest stereocilia).
    *   This opens mechano-electrical transduction channels at the tips.
    *   **$K^+$ Influx:** Potassium flows from the endolymph (+80 mV) into the hair cell (negative interior).
5.  **Neurotransmitter Release:**
    *   Depolarization opens voltage-gated **$Ca^{2+}$ channels**.
    *   Calcium influx causes synaptic vesicles to release **Glutamate** (neurotransmitter) at the base of the hair cell,.
6.  **Nerve Impulse:** This triggers an action potential in the afferent nerve fibers of the [[spiral ganglion]].

## III. Clinical Electrophysiological Tests

### 1. [[Electrocochleography]] (ECochG)
*   **Definition:** Measurement of electrical potentials (CM, SP, and AP) arising in the cochlea and CN VIII within the first 5 ms of stimulation.
*   **Method:** Electrode placed on the [[promontory]] (transtympanic - most accurate) or in the ear canal (extratympanic).
*   **Components:**
    *   Cochlear Microphonic (CM)
    *   Summating Potential (SP)
    *   Action Potential (AP)
*   **Clinical Use:** primarily for **[[Meniere's Disease]]**.
    *   **Pathology:** Endolymphatic hydrops causes the basilar membrane to be displaced, enlarging the Summating Potential (SP).
    *   **Diagnostic Criteria:** An **SP/AP ratio > 0.45 (or > 30%)** is diagnostic of Meniere's disease,,.

### 2. [[Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry]] (BERA/ABR)
*   **Definition:** Objective test measuring electrical activity in the auditory pathway from the nerve to the midbrain.
*   **Waves & Sites of Origin:** (Remember the mnemonic **ECOLI**),.
    *   **Wave I:** Eighth Nerve (distal part)
    *   **Wave II:** Eighth Nerve (proximal part/cochlear nucleus)
    *   **Wave III:** **C**ochlear Nucleus (some sources say Superior Olivary Complex)
    *   **Wave IV:** Superior **O**livary Complex (some sources say Lateral Lemniscus)
    *   **Wave V:** **L**ateral Lemniscus / **I**nferior Colliculus (Largest and most stable wave)
    *   *Note: Generators are complex; Wave V is the most clinically useful parameter.*
*   **Clinical Applications:**
    1.  **Threshold Estimation:** In infants or uncooperative adults. Wave V is traceable down to 10-20 dB above behavioral threshold.
    2.  **Screening:** Newborn Hearing Screening (especially for high-risk NICU babies).
    3.  **Retrocochlear Pathology:** Best audiometric test for **[[Acoustic Neuroma]]** (Vestibular Schwannoma).
        *   **Findings:** Delayed Wave V latency, increased Inter-aural Wave V latency difference (>0.2 ms), or prolonged I-V interpeak interval,.
    4.  **Malingering:** Objective proof of hearing thresholds.

### 3. [[Otoacoustic Emissions]] (OAE)
*   **Principle:** The cochlea produces low-intensity sounds due to the electromotility (contraction/elongation) of the **[[Outer Hair Cells]]** (OHCs),.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Spontaneous (SOAE):** Present in ~50% of normal ears; limited clinical use,.
    *   **Evoked (EOAE):**
        *   *Transient Evoked (TEOAE):* Elicited by clicks. Used for screening. Absent if hearing loss > 30 dB,.
        *   *Distortion Product (DPOAE):* Elicited by two simultaneous tones ($F1$ and $F2$). Frequency-specific. Used for monitoring ototoxicity,.
*   **Clinical Use:**
    *   **Universal Newborn Hearing Screening:** First-line test (fast, non-invasive).
    *   **Ototoxicity Monitoring:** DPOAEs detect OHC damage (e.g., from Cisplatin/Aminoglycosides) before it appears on pure tone audiometry.
    *   **[[Auditory Neuropathy]]:** Hallmarks are **Present OAEs** (normal OHCs) but **Absent/Abnormal BERA** (neural dyssynchrony),.

### 4. [[Auditory Steady State Response]] (ASSR)
*   **Principle:** Objective test using continuous modulated tones.
*   **Use:** estimating frequency-specific thresholds in **severe to profound hearing loss** (>80-90 dB) where BERA may be absent. Useful for cochlear implant candidacy,.

## IV. Vestibular & Facial Electrophysiology

### 1. [[Electronystagmography]] (ENG) / VNG
*   **Principle:** Based on the **Corneo-retinal Potential** (cornea is positive, retina is negative). Eye movements change the electrical field picked up by electrodes,.
*   **Use:** Records nystagmus (spontaneous, positional, caloric) to diagnose vestibular disorders.

### 2. [[Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential]] (VEMP)
*   **Principle:** Measures myogenic response to loud sound stimulation,.
*   **Types:**
    *   **cVEMP (Cervical):** Records from Sternocleidomastoid. Tests **Saccule** and **Inferior Vestibular Nerve** (Vestibulo-collic reflex).
    *   **oVEMP (Ocular):** Records from Inferior Oblique. Tests **Utricle** and **Superior Vestibular Nerve**.
*   **Clinical Use:**
    *   **[[Superior Semicircular Canal Dehiscence]] (SSCD):** Lowered threshold and increased amplitude (hypersensitive),.
    *   **Acoustic Neuroma:** Helps identify the specific nerve of origin (superior vs inferior).

### 3. Facial Nerve Testing
*   **[[Electroneuronography]] (ENoG):** Compares compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) between the healthy and paralyzed side. >90% degeneration implies poor prognosis and need for decompression,.
*   **[[Electromyography]] (EMG):** Detects fibrillation potentials (denervation) vs. polyphasic potentials (reinnervation). Fibrillation appears 14-21 days after injury.
