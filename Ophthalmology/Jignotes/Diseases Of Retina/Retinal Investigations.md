# Retinal Investigations

Thorough evaluation of retinal diseases often requires ancillary testing beyond standard [[Ophthalmoscopy]]. These investigations evaluate the anatomical integrity, vascular status, and functional capability of the [[Retina]] and [[Choroid]].

## 1. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)

[[Optical Coherence Tomography]] is a non-invasive, non-contact imaging modality that provides high-resolution, cross-sectional, and three-dimensional images of the retina, [[Optic Nerve Head]] (ONH), and anterior segment.

### Principle
*   **Low Coherence Interferometry:** It measures the delay and intensity of reflected light (near-infrared light, ~820 nm).
*   **Optical Biopsy:** It provides "in vivo histopathology" of the retinal layers.
*   **Analogy:** It is analogous to B-scan [[Ultrasonography]], but uses **light waves** instead of sound waves.

### Types of OCT
1.  **Time Domain OCT (TD-OCT):** Older generation (e.g., Stratus OCT). Slower acquisition speed.
2.  **Spectral/Frequency Domain OCT (SD-OCT/FD-OCT):** Newer generation. Higher resolution (<10 $\mu$m) and faster speed. Allows 3D reconstruction.
3.  **Swept Source OCT:** Uses a tunable laser source; deeper penetration into the choroid.

### Interpretation of Retinal Layers
On a normal OCT scan:
*   **High Reflectivity (Red/White):** [[Retinal Pigment Epithelium]] (RPE), [[Nerve Fiber Layer]] (NFL).
*   **Low Reflectivity (Black/Blue):** Nuclear layers, fluid.
*   **Foveal Contour:** Characterized by a central depression (foveal pit).

### Pathological Findings & Clinical Implications
| Finding | Appearance on OCT | Clinical Condition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cystoid Spaces** | Hyporeflective (black) cystic spaces in OPL/INL | [[Cystoid Macular Edema]] (CME) |
| **Subretinal Fluid** | Hyporeflective space between neurosensory retina and RPE | [[Central Serous Retinopathy]] (CSR), [[Retinal Detachment]] |
| **Drusen** | Hyper-reflective "bumps" under the RPE | Dry [[Age-Related Macular Degeneration]] (ARMD) |
| **PED** | Dome-shaped elevation of RPE | Pigment Epithelial Detachment |
| **Macular Hole** | Full-thickness defect in foveal center | [[Macular Hole]] |
| **Epiretinal Membrane** | Hyper-reflective line over the ILM | [[Epiretinal Membrane]] (Macular Pucker) |
| **Traction** | Vitreous strands pulling retinal surface | Vitreomacular Traction (VMT) |

## 2. Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA)

[[Fundus Fluorescein Angiography]] is an invasive procedure used to visualize the retinal vasculature and integrity of the blood-retinal barriers (BRB).

### The Dye: Sodium Fluorescein
*   **Nature:** Orange-red powder; yellow in solution.
*   **Binding:** 80% binds to plasma proteins (albumin); 20% is free (responsible for fluorescence).
*   **Pharmacokinetics:** Excreted by kidneys (urine turns yellow for 24-36 hours).
*   **Administration:** 5 mL of 10% solution or 3 mL of 25% solution injected rapidly into the antecubital vein.

### Principle of Fluorescence
*   **Excitation:** Blue filter (490 nm) excites the dye.
*   **Emission:** Dye emits yellow-green light (530 nm).
*   **Barrier:** A yellow-green filter blocks reflected blue light, allowing only fluorescent light to be captured.

### Normal Phases of FFA
1.  **Pre-arterial Phase (Choroidal Flush):** 8–12 seconds post-injection. Patchy filling of choroid via short posterior ciliary arteries.
2.  **Arterial Phase:** 1–2 seconds later. Retinal arteries fill.
3.  **Arteriovenous (Capillary) Phase:** Capillaries fill; laminar flow seen in veins.
4.  **Venous Phase:** Complete filling of veins.
5.  **Recirculation/Late Phase:** Dye recirculates; intensity fades. Optic disc staining is normal in very late phases.

### Abnormal Findings

#### A. Hyperfluorescence (Increased whiteness)
| Mechanism | Description | Example Conditions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Leakage** | Dye leaks out of vessels due to breakdown of **Inner BRB** (endothelium) or neovascularization. Borders enlarge over time. | [[Diabetic Retinopathy]], [[Eales Disease]], [[Choroiditis]], [[Papilledema]]. |
| **Pooling** | Dye accumulates in anatomical space (sub-retinal or sub-RPE) due to breakdown of **Outer BRB**. | [[Central Serous Retinopathy]] (CSR), PED. |
| **Staining** | Dye binds to tissue; intensity remains but size doesn't increase. | [[Drusen]], Scars, Sclera. |
| **Window Defect** | Atrophy of RPE allows visualization of underlying choroidal flush. | Geographic Atrophy in Dry ARMD. |
| **Autofluorescence** | Fluorescence without dye injection (seen in control filters). | [[Optic Disc Drusen]], [[Lipofuscin]]. |

#### B. Hypofluorescence (Darkness)
*   **Blocked Fluorescence:** Blood (hemorrhage), pigment, or exudates mask the underlying fluorescence.
*   **Vascular Non-perfusion:** Capillary dropout (Ischemia) seen in Diabetic Retinopathy or [[Retinal Vein Occlusion]].

### Typical Diagnostic Patterns
*   **Smoke Stack / Ink Blot:** [[Central Serous Retinopathy]].
*   **Flower Petal Pattern:** [[Cystoid Macular Edema]] (CME).
*   **Lacy / Cartwheel Pattern:** Classic Choroidal Neovascular Membrane ([[CNVM]]).
*   **Bull's Eye Maculopathy:** [[Chloroquine Toxicity]] (Window defect surrounding central sparing).

## 3. Indocyanine Green Angiography (ICG/ICGA)

Used primarily to visualize **choroidal circulation**, which is often obscured in FFA due to the RPE or hemorrhage.

### Key Differences from FFA
*   **Dye:** [[Indocyanine Green]].
*   **Protein Binding:** 98% bound to protein (does not leak easily through choriocapillaris fenestrations).
*   **Wavelength:** Near-infrared spectrum (Absorption 805 nm; Emission 835 nm).
*   **Penetration:** Infrared light penetrates RPE, pigment, and thin blood better than blue light.

### Clinical Indications
1.  **Occult CNVM:** To define borders of neovascular membranes hidden under blood/fluid in [[Age-Related Macular Degeneration]].
2.  **Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (PCV):** Diagnosis of branching vascular networks and polyps.
3.  **Chronic CSR:** To detect choroidal hyperpermeability.
4.  **Choroidal Tumors:** Hemangiomas.

## 4. Electroretinography (ERG)

[[Electroretinography]] records the **action potential** (electrical response) of the entire retina triggered by a flash of light. It assesses the function of the **outer retina** (photoreceptors and bipolar cells).

### Components of ERG Wave
> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Normal ERG waveform showing negative 'a' wave followed by positive 'b' wave

1.  **a-wave (Late Receptor Potential):**
    *   **Polarity:** Negative deflection.
    *   **Origin:** [[Photoreceptors]] (Rods and Cones).
2.  **b-wave:**
    *   **Polarity:** Positive (large) deflection.
    *   **Origin:** [[Muller Cells]] and [[Bipolar Cells]].
    *   *Note:* The b-wave represents post-synaptic activity.
3.  **c-wave:**
    *   **Origin:** [[Retinal Pigment Epithelium]] (RPE). Often not seen in standard clinical ERG.

### Types of ERG
*   **Scotopic ERG:** Dark-adapted eye + Dim blue light $\rightarrow$ Tests **Rods**.
*   **Photopic ERG:** Light-adapted eye + Bright flash $\rightarrow$ Tests **Cones**.
*   **Flicker ERG:** 30 Hz flicker $\rightarrow$ Isolates **Cones** (Rods cannot follow high frequency).
*   **Multifocal ERG (mfERG):** Maps central 30 degrees; useful for macular diseases (e.g., [[Chloroquine Toxicity]]).

### Clinical Implications
*   **Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP):** **Extinguished** or unrecordable ERG (early loss of scotopic response).
*   **CRAO:** **Negative ERG** (Normal 'a' wave, absent 'b' wave) because photoreceptors (supplied by choroid) are spared, but inner layers (bipolar cells) die.
*   **Siderosis (Iron toxicity):** Initially super-normal, later extinguished.
*   **Congenital Night Blindness:** Abnormal scotopic ERG.

> **Mnemonic for Negative ERG:** **C**-**R**-**M** (CRAO, Retinoschisis, Melanoma associated retinopathy).

## 5. Electro-oculography (EOG)

[[Electro-oculography]] measures the **standing potential** (resting potential) of the eye. The cornea is electrically positive relative to the back of the eye.

### Principle
*   Tests the integrity of the **Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE)** and its interaction with photoreceptors.
*   Patient moves eyes side-to-side between two fixation points. Electrodes near canthi record potential changes.

### Arden's Ratio
*   The test compares the potential in light-adapted vs. dark-adapted states.
*   **Formula:** $\frac{\text{Light Peak}}{\text{Dark Trough}}$
*   **Normal Value:** > **1.85** (or 185%).
*   **Abnormal:** < 1.50 (or 150%).

### Clinical Indications
*   **Best's Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy:** This is the **Gold Standard** diagnosis.
    *   Finding: **Abnormal EOG** (Arden ratio < 1.5) with a **Normal ERG**.
*   Toxic Retinopathies (e.g., Chloroquine).
*   Vitamin A deficiency.
