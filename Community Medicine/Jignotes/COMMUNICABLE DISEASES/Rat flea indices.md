# Rat Flea Indices

**Rat flea indices** are quantitative measures used in flea surveys to assess the density of the vector population (fleas) and the potential risk of a [[Plague]] outbreak. These indices are crucial for epidemiological surveillance and for evaluating the effectiveness of insecticide spraying programs.

### **Commonly Used Indices**

The following indices are widely used in rat flea surveys:

| Index Name | Definition / Calculation | Clinical/Epidemiological Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. General Flea Index** (Total Flea Index) | The average number of fleas of **all species** per rodent. | Provides a general idea of the vector load but is less specific than the Cheopis index. |
| **2. Specific Flea Index** ([[Cheopis Index]]) | The average number of fleas of a **specific species** (e.g., *Xenopsylla cheopis*) per rodent. | **Most Important Index.** <br> A Cheopis Index **> 1** is considered the critical density. If the index is > 1, it indicates the **potential explosiveness** of the situation should a plague outbreak occur. |
| **3. Rodent Infestation Rate** | The percentage of rodents infested with various flea species. | Indicates how widespread the infestation is within the rodent population. |
| **4. Percentage Incidence** | The percentage of fleas of **each species** found per rodent. | Helps identify the dominant vector species in the area. |
| **5. Burrow Index** | The average number of **free-living fleas** per species per rodent burrow. | Measures the reservoir of fleas in the environment (soil of burrows). |

### **Interpretation and Significance**

*   **Warning Signal:** Flea indices do **not** in themselves predict an *imminent* plague epidemic.
*   **Potential Explosiveness:** They serve as indicators of the **potential explosiveness** of the situation. High indices warn that if [[Yersinia pestis]] is introduced, it could spread rapidly.
*   **Control Target:** For effective control of plague during an outbreak, insecticidal spraying should continue until the **Flea Index drops to zero** (ideally within 48 hours of application).
*   **Specificity:** Specific flea indices (like the Cheopis index) are statistically more significant and useful than the overall/general flea index.

### **Mnemonic**

To remember the 5 types of indices: **"Rats Spread Bubonic Plague Globally"**

*   **R** - **R**odent Infestation Rate
*   **S** - **S**pecific Flea Index ([[Cheopis Index]])
*   **B** - **B**urrow Index
*   **P** - **P**ercentage Incidence of species
*   **G** - **G**eneral Flea Index

### **Clinical Relevance**

*   **Vector Identification:** The primary vectors concerned are [[Xenopsylla cheopis]] (Oriental rat flea) and *Xenopsylla astia*. *X. cheopis* is the most efficient vector due to its biting habits and susceptibility to blockage.
*   **Surveillance:** Routine calculation of these indices helps health authorities decide when to intensify anti-flea measures (like dusting with DDT or Malathion) before anti-rodent measures, to prevent fleas from leaving dead rats and biting humans.
