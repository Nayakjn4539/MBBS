# Physiology of Vision: Phototransduction and Processing

The physiology of vision is a complex process involving the conversion of light energy into electrical impulses ([[Phototransduction]]), the processing of these signals within the retina, and their transmission through the [[Visual Pathway]] to the cerebral cortex for perception.

---

### 1. Phototransduction
Phototransduction is the process by which light energy is converted into a neural signal by the [[Photoreceptors]] ([[Rods]] and [[Cones]]).

#### A. Visual Pigments
*   **Rods:** Contain [[Rhodopsin]] (Visual Purple). Responsible for scotopic (night) vision. Peak sensitivity at ~500 nm.
*   **Cones:** Contain **Photopsins** (Iodopsin). Responsible for photopic (day) and color vision.
*   **Composition:** These pigments are G-protein coupled receptors composed of:
    *   **Opsin:** A protein part (Scotopsin in rods).
    *   **Chromophore:** [[11-cis retinal]] (Aldehyde form of [[Vitamin A]]).

#### B. The Visual Cycle (Rhodopsin Cycle)
This cycle maintains the supply of light-sensitive pigments. It occurs partly in the photoreceptors and partly in the [[Retinal Pigment Epithelium]] (RPE).

1.  **Bleaching (Photo-decomposition):**
    *   Light strikes the retina.
    *   **Isomerization:** [[11-cis retinal]] undergoes conformational change to **all-trans retinal** (more stable isomer),.
    *   **Intermediates:** This creates unstable intermediates: Bathorhodopsin $\rightarrow$ Lumirhodopsin $\rightarrow$ Metarhodopsin I $\rightarrow$ **Metarhodopsin II**,.
    *   **Metarhodopsin II** is the active enzyme responsible for initiating the electrical impulse.
    *   Final separation: Opsin and all-trans retinal separate (bleaching).

2.  **Regeneration:**
    *   **All-trans retinal** is converted to **All-trans retinol** (Vitamin A) via *alcohol dehydrogenase*.
    *   It travels to the [[Retinal Pigment Epithelium]] (RPE).
    *   In the RPE, it is isomerized back to **11-cis retinol** and then oxidized to **11-cis retinal**.
    *   **11-cis retinal** returns to the photoreceptor outer segment to recombine with Opsin.

#### C. Electrical Events (Signal Cascade)
Unlike most neurons, photoreceptors **hyperpolarize** in response to stimulation.

| State | Biochemical Events | Membrane Potential | Neurotransmitter |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dark State** | High levels of [[cGMP]]. Na+ channels are **OPEN**. Na+ influx occurs (Dark Current). | **Depolarization** (-40mV) | Continuous release of [[Glutamate]] (inhibitory)., |
| **Light State** | 1. Light activates Rhodopsin (Metarhodopsin II).<br>2. Activates [[Transducin]] (G-protein).<br>3. Activates [[Phosphodiesterase]] (PDE).<br>4. PDE hydrolyzes cGMP (decreases cGMP). | **Hyperpolarization** (-70mV) | Na+ channels **CLOSE**. Glutamate release stops. |

**Mechanism Summary:**
> Light $\rightarrow$ Rhodopsin $\rightarrow$ Transducin $\rightarrow$ Phosphodiesterase $\rightarrow$ Decreased cGMP $\rightarrow$ Na+ Channels Close $\rightarrow$ Hyperpolarization $\rightarrow$ Signal transmitted to Bipolar cells.

**Clinical Implications:**
*   **Vitamin A Deficiency:** Leads to defective regeneration of rhodopsin, causing [[Nyctalopia]] (Night Blindness) and [[Bitot's spots]],.
*   **Retinitis Pigmentosa:** A hereditary dystrophy affecting rods first, leading to night blindness and tunnel vision.

### 2. Neural Processing and Transmission
Once the potential is generated in photoreceptors, it is processed via the retinal layers and transmitted to the brain.

#### A. Retinal Transmission
*   **Order of Neurons:**
    1.  **First Order:** [[Bipolar Cells]] (located in the inner nuclear layer).
    2.  **Second Order:** [[Ganglion Cells]] (axons form the optic nerve).
    3.  **Third Order:** Neurons in the [[Lateral Geniculate Body]] (LGB).
*   **Conduction:**
    *   Photoreceptors, Bipolar cells, and Horizontal cells transmit signals via **Electrotonic conduction** (graded potentials).
    *   Action potentials are generated only at the **Ganglion cells**.

#### B. Parallel Processing Pathways
The visual information is segregated into distinct channels from the ganglion cells to the LGB and Cortex.

1.  **Magnocellular Pathway (M-cells):**
    *   **Origin:** Large Gamma-ganglion cells (Y-cells).
    *   **LGB Layers:** 1 and 2.
    *   **Function:** Detection of **Motion**, flicker, and depth (stereopsis). Colour blind (monochromatic),.
    *   **Mnemonic:** **M** for **M**otion and **M**agnitude (Large).

2.  **Parvocellular Pathway (P-cells):**
    *   **Origin:** Small X-ganglion cells (midget cells) mostly from the macula.
    *   **LGB Layers:** 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    *   **Function:** Detection of **Colour**, texture, form, and fine visual acuity,.
    *   **Mnemonic:** **P** for **P**aint (Colour) and **P**recision.

3.  **Koniocellular Pathway:**
    *   Involved in Blue-Yellow colour processing.

### 3. Visual Perceptions
Vision is not a single sensation but a complex integration of four faculties.

#### 1. Light Sense
*   The ability to perceive light and adapt to varying intensities.
*   **Dark Adaptation:** The ability of the eye to adapt to decreasing illumination.
    *   **Rods:** More sensitive but adapt slowly (take 20-30 mins).
    *   **Cones:** Adapt rapidly but are less sensitive.
    *   The **Dark Adaptation Curve** shows a "knee" point where rod function takes over from cone function.

#### 2. Form Sense (Visual Acuity)
*   The ability to discriminate the shape and details of objects.
*   **Site:** Most acute at the [[Fovea Centralis]] due to high cone density.
*   **Minimum Angle of Resolution (MAR):** To resolve two points as separate, they must subtend a visual angle of **1 minute of arc** at the nodal point of the eye.
*   **Clinical Test:** [[Snellen's Chart]].

#### 3. Contrast Sensitivity
*   The ability to perceive slight changes in luminance between regions not separated by definite borders.
*   Important for driving in fog or at night. May be impaired even with normal visual acuity (e.g., in Cataract, Glaucoma).
*   **Clinical Tests:** [[Pelli-Robson Chart]], Arden gratings, Cambridge low contrast gratings.

#### 4. Colour Sense
*   Ability to distinguish wavelengths of light (Photopic function).
*   **Trichromatic Theory (Young-Helmholtz):** Three types of cones exist:
    *   **Erythrolabe:** Red sensitive (L-cones).
    *   **Chlorolabe:** Green sensitive (M-cones).
    *   **Cyanolabe:** Blue sensitive (S-cones).
*   **Opponent Colour Theory (Hering):** Processing occurs in antagonistic pairs: Red-Green, Blue-Yellow, and Black-White.

**Clinical Implications (Colour Blindness):**
*   **Protanopia/Protanomaly:** Defect in Red.
*   **Deuteranopia/Deuteranomaly:** Defect in Green.
*   **Tritanopia/Tritanomaly:** Defect in Blue.
*   **Tests:** [[Ishihara Chart]] (screening), [[Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Test]] (sensitive grading), [[Nagel's Anomaloscope]] (confirmatory),.
