# [[Strabismus (Squint)]] > Tests and measurements of squint

### **Clinical Evaluation of Strabismus (Squint)**

The evaluation of [[strabismus]] involves a systematic approach to determine the type, extent, and cause of the deviation, as well as the status of [[binocular single vision]].

---

### **1. Preliminary Assessment**

Before specific motor testing, baseline parameters must be established.

*   **[[Visual Acuity]] (VA):** Essential to detect [[amblyopia]]. In children, use age-appropriate tests (e.g., Teller Acuity Cards, Cardiff cards, or Snellen’s E-chart).,
*   **[[Cycloplegic Refraction]]:** Mandatory in all children to rule out [[accommodative esotropia]] (high hypermetropia).,
*   **Inspection:** Look for [[pseudostrabismus]] caused by [[epicanthus]] (pseudoesotropia) or [[hypertelorism]] (pseudoexotropia).,

---

### **2. Assessment of Ocular Movements**

Movements are tested in the **nine diagnostic positions of gaze**.

*   **[[Ductions]]:** Monocular movements (one eye covered). Tested to assess the range of motion of individual muscles.
*   **[[Versions]]:** Binocular conjugate movements (both eyes open). Used to detect underaction or overaction of synergistic muscle pairs (yoke muscles).
*   **[[Vergences]]:** Disjugate movements (convergence and divergence).

**Clinical Implication:**
If a defect is seen in versions, confirm it with ductions. If movement improves on ductions, it suggests a supranuclear cause; if it remains restricted, it suggests a muscle palsy or mechanical restriction.

---

### **3. Measurement of Ocular Deviation (Objective Tests)**

These tests do not rely on the patient's verbal response and are crucial for young children.

#### **A. Corneal Reflex Tests**
Used when visual acuity is poor or the patient is uncooperative.

**1. [[Hirschberg Test]]**
*   **Principle:** Observation of the position of the corneal light reflex in the squinting eye when the patient fixates on a torchlight (at 33 cm).,
*   **Mnemonic:** **DOOR** (Deviation Opposite Of Reflection). If reflex is nasal, deviation is temporal (Exotropia).
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   **Reflex at pupil center:** Normal (Orthophoric).
    *   **Reflex at pupil margin:** 15° (approx 30 Prism Diopters/PD).
    *   **Reflex between pupil margin and limbus:** ~30°.
    *   **Reflex at limbus:** 45° (approx 90 PD).,
    *   **Rule of thumb:** 1 mm deviation $\approx$ 7° $\approx$ 15 PD.,

**2. [[Krimsky Test]] (Prism Reflex Test)**
*   **Method:** Prisms are placed in front of the **fixating eye** until the corneal reflex in the deviating eye becomes central.
*   **Modified Krimsky:** Prisms placed in front of the **deviating eye** to center the reflex. Used to measure the angle of deviation objectively.

#### **B. Cover Tests**
These are the most important tests to differentiate latent from manifest squint.,

| Test Type | Purpose | Procedure | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Cover Test]]** | Detects **[[Heterotropia]]** (Manifest Squint) | Patient fixes on a target. Cover the "normal" appearing eye. Observe the uncovered eye. | If the uncovered eye moves to take up fixation, a manifest squint is present. (e.g., Eye moves out = Esotropia). |
| **[[Cover-Uncover Test]]** | Detects **[[Heterophoria]]** (Latent Squint) | Cover one eye, then remove cover. Observe the *just uncovered* eye. | If the eye was deviated under cover and moves back to fixate upon uncovering, phoria is present. |
| **[[Alternate Cover Test]]** | Reveals total deviation (Phoria + Tropia) | Rapidly shift cover from one eye to the other to break fusion completely. | Maximum deviation is elicited. Used for measurement with prisms. |

**Mnemonic:** **DOOM** (Deviation Opposite Of Movement). If eye moves *in* to fixate, it was deviated *out* (Exotropia).

#### **C. [[Prism Bar Cover Test]] (PBCT)**
*   **Status:** Gold standard/Most accurate method for measuring deviation.
*   **Method:** An alternate cover test is performed while placing prisms of increasing strength in front of one eye.
*   **Endpoint:** The point where there is **no recovery movement** of the eyes.
*   **Prism Orientation (Mnemonic: DOCS):** **D**eviation **O**pposite **C**over (Base). Or simply: Place the **Apex** towards the deviation (Base opposite).
    *   **Esotropia:** Base Out.
    *   **Exotropia:** Base In.
    *   **Hypertropia:** Base Down.

### **4. Measurement of Deviation (Subjective Tests)**

These require patient cooperation and intact sensory mechanisms (no deep suppression). Based on the principle of diplopia.

#### **A. [[Maddox Rod Test]]**
*   **Principle:** Dissociates eyes by converting a point light source into a red line (streak) in one eye while the other sees a white light.,
*   **Uses:** Best for diagnosing **[[Heterophoria]]** at distance.
*   **Procedure:** A Maddox rod (series of red cylinders) is placed before the right eye.
*   **Interpretation:** The streak is perpendicular to the axis of the rod.
    *   **Rod Horizontal (Vertical Streak):** Measures horizontal deviation.
    *   **Rod Vertical (Horizontal Streak):** Measures vertical deviation.

| Condition | Appearance (Right Eye has Red Rod) | Type of Diplopia |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Orthophoria]]** | Red line passes through the light | None |
| **[[Esophoria]]/Tropia** | Red line is to the Right of light | Uncrossed (Homonymous) |
| **[[Exophoria]]/Tropia** | Red line is to the Left of light | Crossed (Heteronymous) |

#### **B. [[Maddox Wing]]**
*   **Principle:** Dissociates eyes for **near vision** (33 cm) using a septum.,
*   **Procedure:** Patient looks through slits. Right eye sees arrows (white/red), Left eye sees scales (horizontal/vertical).
*   **Uses:** Quick measurement of horizontal and vertical **phoria at near**. Also measures cyclophoria.

#### **C. [[Double Maddox Rod Test]]**
*   **Use:** To detect and measure **[[Cyclotropia]]** (torsional deviation).,
*   **Method:** Two Maddox rods (one red, one white) are placed in a trial frame. The patient rotates them until the two lines appear parallel.

### **5. Tests for Paralytic (Incomitant) Squint**

Used to identify the paralyzed muscle and separate paretic from restrictive causes.

#### **A. [[Diplopia Charting]]**
*   Subjective test using Red-Green goggles. The patient describes the separation of images in 9 gazes.
*   **Rule:** The separation of images is greatest in the direction of action of the paralyzed muscle. The distal image belongs to the paralytic eye.

#### **B. [[Hess Screen]] / [[Lees Screen]]**
*   **Principle:** Dissociates the eyes using red-green goggles (Hess) or mirrors (Lees). Based on **confusion** (fovea of one eye projects to the same point in space as fovea of the other).,
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   Compares the "muscle fields" of both eyes.
    *   **Smaller chart:** Belongs to the eye with the **paretic muscle** (underaction).
    *   **Larger chart:** Belongs to the normal eye (overaction of yoke muscle - Hering's Law).
    *   **Shape:** Compressed inward in the direction of the paralyzed muscle.

#### **C. [[Forced Duction Test]] (FDT)**
*   **Differentiation:** Distinguishes **Restrictive** squint (e.g., Thyroid eye disease, blow-out fracture) from **Paralytic** squint.,
*   **Procedure:** Under topical anesthesia, the conjunctiva is grasped with forceps, and the eye is mechanically rotated.
    *   **Positive FDT:** Resistance felt $\rightarrow$ **Restrictive** pathology (Mechanical).
    *   **Negative FDT:** No resistance (eye moves freely) $\rightarrow$ **Paralytic** pathology (Neurological).

#### **D. Active [[Force Generation Test]] (FGT)**
*   Used to assess the residual function of a paretic muscle. The patient attempts to move the eye against the resistance of the forceps held by the examiner.

### **6. Assessment of Binocular Vision & Sensory Anomalies**

These tests evaluate the grades of Binocular Single Vision (BSV): Simultaneous Perception (Grade I), Fusion (Grade II), and Stereopsis (Grade III).

#### **A. [[Worth Four Dot Test]]**
*   **Equipment:** Patient wears Red goggle (Right eye) and Green goggle (Left eye). Views a box with 4 lights: 1 Red, 2 Green, 1 White.,
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   **4 Lights:** Normal BSV or ARC (Harmonious).
    *   **2 Red Lights:** Left Suppression.
    *   **3 Green Lights:** Right Suppression.
    *   **5 Lights (2 Red + 3 Green):** Diplopia (manifest squint without suppression).

#### **B. [[Bagolini Striated Glasses]]**
*   **Principle:** Least dissociative test (closest to natural viewing). Glasses have fine striations that convert a point light into a line.,
*   **Results:**
    *   **Cross (X) through light:** Normal BSV or Harmonious ARC.
    *   **One line only:** Suppression.
    *   **Two lines with a break/gap:** Scotoma (Microtropia).

#### **C. [[Synoptophore]] (Amblyoscope)**
*   **The "Jack of all trades" instrument.**
*   **Uses:**
    *   Measures objective and subjective angles of squint.
    *   Diagnoses **ARC** (Abnormal Retinal Correspondence): If Objective angle $\neq$ Subjective angle.
    *   Grades BSV (I, II, III).
    *   Detects suppression.
    *   Therapeutic use (orthoptic exercises).

#### **D. [[4 Prism Base Out Test]]**
*   **Indication:** To diagnose **[[Microtropia]]** (monofixation syndrome) or verify bifoveal fixation.,
*   **Method:** A 4 PD base-out prism is placed before one eye.
*   **Normal:** The eye moves in (to correct displacement) and the other eye moves out (Hering's law) then corrects back (fusional convergence).
*   **Microtropia:** If prism is placed over the scotomatous (squinting) eye, **no movement** is seen.

#### **E. Tests for [[Stereopsis]] (Depth Perception)**
*   **Titmus Fly Test:** Uses polarized glasses. (Gross stereopsis).,
*   **TNO Test:** Random dot stereogram (Red-Green glasses). Eliminates monocular cues.,
*   **Lang Test:** No glasses required (useful in infants).
*   **Two Pencil Test:** Bedside test for gross stereopsis.
