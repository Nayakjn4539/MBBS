# [[Surgeries In Ophthalmology]] > General Principles

### General Principles: Eye Speculums

In ophthalmic surgery, the exposure of the [[eyeball]] is paramount. **Eye speculums** (lid speculums) are mechanical instruments designed to retract the eyelids and maintain the palpebral aperture open during surgical or diagnostic procedures.

#### Classification and Types of Speculums

There are three primary types of speculums utilized in clinical practice:

| Type | Description | Key Features | Clinical Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Universal Metallic Eye Speculum** | Most common type. It has two limbs and a spring mechanism controlled by a screw to adjust the width of the limbs. | • **Universal:** Can be used for both Right and Left eyes.<br>• **Blades:** Open (fenestrated). | Standard intraocular and extraocular surgeries. |
| **Speculum with Guard (Solid Blades)** | Similar to the universal type but possesses solid blades instead of open wire frames. | • **Solid Blades:** Cover the lid margins and eyelashes.<br>• **Protection:** Keeps [[eyelashes]] away from the sterile surgical field. | Used when lashes are long or likely to obstruct the surgical field/cause contamination. |
| **Wire Speculum** (e.g., Barraquer) | A simple, very light wire construction without a screw mechanism. | • **Lightweight:** Causes minimal pressure on the [[eyeball]].<br>• **Universal:** Fits both eyes. | Preferred in pediatric cases or when minimal pressure on the globe is required. |

#### Indications for Use

Eye speculums are employed in a wide variety of ophthalmic procedures to ensure adequate exposure and prevent [[blepharospasm]] from interfering with the surgery.

**1. Intraocular Surgeries**
*   [[Cataract surgery]] (ECCE, Phacoemulsification).
*   [[Glaucoma surgery]] (e.g., Trabeculectomy).
*   [[Keratoplasty]] (Corneal transplantation).

**2. Extraocular Surgeries**
*   [[Squint surgery]] (Strabismus correction).
*   [[Pterygium]] excision.

**3. Destructive Surgeries**
*   [[Enucleation]] (Removal of the eyeball).
*   [[Evisceration]] (Removal of intraocular contents).

**4. Minor Procedures and Examination**
*   Removal of [[conjunctival foreign body]] or [[corneal foreign body]].
*   Cauterization of [[corneal ulcer]].
*   Examination of the eye in a patient with severe [[blepharospasm]] (inability to open eyes voluntarily).
*   [[Intravitreal injection]] administration.

#### Clinical Implications and Safety

*   **Pressure on the Globe:** Standard speculums can exert external pressure on the eyeball. In cases where the globe is open (e.g., repairing a corneal tear) or when [[intraocular pressure]] is critically high, heavy speculums should be avoided to prevent **vitreous loss**. In such high-risk scenarios, a lightweight wire speculum or distinct lid retraction sutures may be preferred.
*   **Lash Isolation:** To prevent endophthalmitis, it is crucial that eyelashes do not touch the surgical field. A solid blade (guarded) speculum effectively isolates lashes. Alternatively, sterile drapes (e.g., Tegaderm) are used to tape lashes back before inserting a universal or wire speculum.
