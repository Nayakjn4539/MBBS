# Eye Bank and Donor Cornea

## Eye Bank Organization
An [[Eye Bank]] is an organization responsible for the collection, storage, and distribution of cornea for the purpose of [[Corneal Grafting]], research, and supply of eye tissue for other ophthalmic purposes.

### Functions of an Eye Bank
1.  **Promotion:** Increasing public awareness about eye donation.
2.  **Registration:** Registering pledgers for [[Eye Donation]].
3.  **Collection:** Harvesting donated eyes from the deceased.
4.  **Processing:** Evaluating and processing donor eyes.
5.  **Preservation:** Storing tissue for short, intermediate, or long terms.
6.  **Distribution:** Supplying donor tissue to corneal surgeons.
7.  **Research:** Activities to improve preservation methodology.

### Eye Bank Personnel
*   **Eye Bank In-charge:** Qualified ophthalmologist to evaluate and process tissue.
*   **Eye Bank Technician:** Assists in enucleation, records data, processes donor eyes with antibiotics, and maintains asepsis.
*   **Grief Counsellors:** To motivate relatives for donation.

### Collection of Donor Eyes
*   **Timing:** Eyes must be removed as early as possible, ideally within **6 hours** of death,. In cold climates or if the body is refrigerated, this can be extended up to 12 hours,.
*   **Techniques:**
    1.  **Whole Globe (Enucleation):** Entire eyeball removed and placed in a sterile moist chamber.
    2.  **In-situ Excision:** Corneoscleral rim is excised at the site of retrieval and placed directly in storage medium.

## Donor Cornea: Evaluation and Preservation

### Contraindications for Donor Selection
Donor tissue is considered unsuitable if there is a risk of disease transmission or poor tissue quality.
**Absolute Contraindications:**
*   **Viral Infections:** [[HIV]]/AIDS, [[Hepatitis B]] (HBsAg), [[Hepatitis C]], [[Rabies]], Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE),,.
*   **Bacterial/Fungal:** Active septicaemia, active viraemia, fungal endophthalmitis.
*   **Malignancies:** Disseminated haematological malignancies (Leukaemia, Lymphoma), Retinoblastoma, Malignant Melanoma.
*   **Neurological:** Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, death due to unknown cause,.

**Mnemonic for Contraindications: "SHRIMP"**
*   **S** - Septicemia/Syphilis
*   **H** - Hepatitis/HIV
*   **R** - Rabies/Retinoblastoma
*   **I** - Intrinsic eye disease (Malignancy)
*   **M** - Meningitis/Malignancy (Leukemia)
*   **P** - Prion disease (Creutzfeldt-Jakob)

### Evaluation of Donor Tissue
Donor tissue is graded (Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor) based on slit-lamp biomicroscopy and [[Specular Microscopy]],.
*   **Endothelial Count:** Critical for graft survival. Normal count in young adults is ~3000 cells/mm².
*   **Minimum Requirement:** For [[Penetrating Keratoplasty]], a count of **>1500-2000 cells/mm²** is generally required.

### Methods of Corneal Preservation
Appropriate storage media maintain endothelial viability.

| Type of Storage | Duration | Method/Medium | Temperature |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Short-term** | Up to 48-96 hours | **Moist Chamber**: Whole globe,.<br>**M-K Medium** (McCarey-Kaufman): TC-199 + Dextran + Antibiotics,. | 4°C |
| **Intermediate** | Up to 14 days | **Chondroitin Sulphate Enriched**: <br>[[Optisol-GS]] (Standard in USA).<br>Cornisol, Dexol, Eusol,. | 4°C |
| **Long-term** | Up to 35 days (Organ Culture)<br>Up to 1 year (Cryo) | **Organ Culture**: Modified Eagle's Medium.<br>**Cryopreservation**: Liquid Nitrogen/Glycerol (usually for tectonic grafts). | 30-37°C<br>-70°C |

## Surgical Instruments for Corneal Surgery

### 1. Eye Speculums
Used to keep the eyelids apart during intraocular and extraocular surgeries.

*   **Universal Metallic Eye Speculum:**
    *   Can be used for either right or left eye.
    *   Has a screw mechanism to adjust the limb width.
    *   Blades are open (wire-like).
*   **Eye Speculum with Guard (Solid Blades):**
    *   Similar to universal but has solid blades/guards.
    *   **Clinical Use:** Protects and keeps eyelashes away from the surgical field.
*   **Wire Speculum (Barraquer):**
    *   Very light weight.
    *   Causes minimal pressure on the eyeball.
    *   **Uses:** Cataract surgery, [[Glaucoma Surgery]], [[Keratoplasty]], removal of foreign bodies.

### 2. Corneal Trephine
A circular cutting blade used to excise the corneal button from the donor and the recipient.

*   **Mechanism:** Cuts a circular disc of the cornea.
*   **Sizing (Donor vs. Recipient):**
    *   The donor corneal button is usually cut **0.25 mm to 0.5 mm larger** than the recipient opening,.
    *   **Reason:** Ensures better apposition, deeper anterior chamber, reduces peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS), and reduces incidence of glaucoma.
    *   *Exception:* In [[Keratoconus]], 0.25 mm oversizing is preferred; in aphakia, 1.0 mm oversizing may be used.
*   **Technique:**
    *   **Donor:** Cut from the **endothelial side** (using a Teflon block).
    *   **Recipient (Host):** Partial thickness incision made on the epithelial side, followed by entry into the [[Anterior Chamber]].

### 3. Corneal Spring Scissors (Section Enlarging Scissors)
Fine curved scissors where cutting blades are kept apart by spring action.

*   **Types:** Universal (for both sides) or Right/Left specific.
*   **Uses:**
    *   To enlarge the corneal or corneoscleral incision during [[Cataract Extraction]] (ECCE).
    *   To complete the excision of the recipient corneal button in **Keratoplasty** after initial trephination,.
    *   To cut scleral and trabecular tissue in **Trabeculectomy**.

### 4. Plain Dissecting Forceps (Plain Forceps)
Simple forceps without teeth at the tip, though serrations may be present.

*   **Structure:** Simple limbs, no locking mechanism usually.
*   **Uses:**
    *   To hold the **conjunctiva** during surgical procedures (preventing trauma that toothed forceps might cause to delicate flaps).
    *   To **tie sutures** (suture tying forceps are a variation).
    *   To hold the **scleral flap** during trabeculectomy.
    *   To hold **nasal mucosal flaps** during [[Dacryocystorhinostomy]] (DCR).
