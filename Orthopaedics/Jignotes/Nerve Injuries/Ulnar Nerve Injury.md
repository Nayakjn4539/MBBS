# Ulnar Nerve Injury

The [[ulnar nerve]], often referred to as the "Musician's Nerve" (due to its control over fine finger movements), is a terminal branch of the [[medial cord]] of the [[brachial plexus]] (Roots: [[C8]], [[T1]]). It is one of the most commonly injured peripheral nerves, frequently resulting in significant functional impairment of the hand.

## Anatomy and Course
*   **Origin:** Medial cord of the brachial plexus.
*   **Arm:** Runs medially, pierces the medial intermuscular septum to enter the posterior compartment.
*   **Elbow:** Passes behind the [[medial epicondyle]] in the **cubital tunnel** (a common site for compression/injury).
*   **Forearm:** Enters between the two heads of the [[flexor carpi ulnaris]] (FCU). It descends along the ulnar side.
*   **Wrist:** Enters the hand superficial to the [[flexor retinaculum]] via [[Guyon's canal]].

## Etiology and Sites of Injury

The nerve is vulnerable at two main sites: the elbow (High Lesion) and the wrist (Low Lesion).

| Level of Injury | Common Causes |
| :--- | :--- |
| **High Lesion (Elbow)** | • **Fractures:** [[Medial epicondyle fracture]], [[Supracondylar fracture]] (rarely).<br>• **Dislocations:** [[Elbow dislocation]].<br>• **Compression:** [[Cubital tunnel syndrome]] (e.g., leaning on elbows).<br>• **Deformity:** [[Cubitus valgus]] leading to [[Tardy ulnar nerve palsy]]. |
| **Low Lesion (Wrist)** | • **Trauma:** Cuts/lacerations (e.g., glass injuries) anterior to the wrist.<br>• **Compression:** [[Guyon's canal syndrome]] (e.g., ganglion cysts, cyclist's palsy). |

**Clinical Implication:** [[Tardy ulnar nerve palsy]] is a delayed onset paralysis occurring years after a childhood elbow fracture (usually lateral condyle fracture) that resulted in a [[cubitus valgus]] deformity. The nerve gets stretched over the medial epicondyle.

## Clinical Features

The clinical presentation depends on the level of the lesion.

### 1. Motor Loss
*   **Forearm Muscles (Lost in High Lesions only):**
    *   [[Flexor carpi ulnaris]] (FCU): Weakness in wrist flexion and adduction.
    *   Medial half of [[Flexor digitorum profundus]] (FDP): Loss of active flexion of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints of the ring and little fingers.
*   **Hand Muscles (Lost in High and Low Lesions):**
    *   **Hypothenar Muscles:** [[Abductor digiti minimi]], [[Flexor digiti minimi]], [[Opponens digiti minimi]].
    *   **Intrinsic Muscles:** [[Palmar interossei]] (Adduction), [[Dorsal interossei]] (Abduction), Medial two [[Lumbricals]].
    *   **Thenar Muscle:** [[Adductor pollicis]].

### 2. Sensory Loss
*   **Distribution:** Anesthesia or paresthesia over the medial 1½ fingers (little finger and ulnar half of the ring finger) and the corresponding ulnar border of the hand.
*   **High vs. Low Lesion Distinction:**
    *   **High Lesion:** Loss of sensation on both palmar and dorsal aspects.
    *   **Low Lesion:** The **dorsal cutaneous branch** arises *proximal* to the wrist. Therefore, in wrist cuts, dorsal sensation is often **spared**, while palmar sensation is lost.

### 3. Deformity: Ulnar Claw Hand
*   **Appearance:** Hyperextension of the [[metacarpophalangeal joints]] (MCP) and flexion of the [[interphalangeal joints]] (IP) of the ring and little fingers.
*   **Mechanism:** Paralysis of [[lumbricals]] and [[interossei]] leads to unopposed action of:
    *   Extensors (ED) $\rightarrow$ MCP hyperextension.
    *   Flexors (FDP/FDS) $\rightarrow$ IP flexion.
*   **Wasting:** "Guttering" of the dorsum of the hand due to interossei wasting and flattening of the [[hypothenar eminence]].

## The Ulnar Paradox
This is a classic exam topic involving a counter-intuitive clinical finding.

*   **Concept:** "The higher the lesion, the *less* the deformity; the lower the lesion, the *greater* the deformity".
*   **Explanation:**
    *   **High Lesion (Elbow):** The [[Flexor digitorum profundus]] (FDP) to the ring/little fingers is paralyzed. Without the FDP flexing the DIP joints, the clawing appearance is mild.
    *   **Low Lesion (Wrist):** The FDP is spared and functioning. Its unopposed pull causes severe flexion at the IP joints, resulting in a pronounced/severe claw hand,.

## Clinical Tests for Ulnar Nerve

| Test Name | Muscle Tested | Procedure & Positive Sign |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Froment's Sign]]** (Book Test) | [[Adductor pollicis]] | Patient grasps a book between thumb and index finger. <br>**Positive:** Patient flexes the thumb IP joint (using *Flexor Pollicis Longus* - Median N.) because Adductor Pollicis (Ulnar N.) is weak,. |
| **[[Card Test]]** | [[Palmar interossei]] | Patient tries to hold a card between extended fingers while examiner pulls it. <br>**Positive:** Difficulty holding the card due to weak adduction. |
| **[[Egawa Test]]** | [[Dorsal interossei]] | Hand flat on table, patient asked to move middle finger sideways. <br>**Positive:** Inability to deviate middle finger (Abduction). |

## Management

### Conservative Management
Indicated for neuropraxia or closed injuries with signs of recovery.
*   **Splinting:** [[Knuckle bender splint]].
    *   *Mechanism:* It keeps the MCP joints flexed, preventing hyperextension. This allows the extensor digitorum to extend the IP joints, preventing contractures.
*   Physiotherapy to maintain joint suppleness.

### Surgical Management
*   **Decompression:** For entrapment syndromes (e.g., cutting the arcuate ligament in [[cubital tunnel syndrome]] or releasing the roof of [[Guyon's canal]]).
*   **Anterior Transposition:** Moving the nerve anterior to the medial epicondyle. Indicated for [[Tardy ulnar nerve palsy]] or recurrent subluxation of the nerve,.
*   **Nerve Repair:** End-to-end suture or nerve grafting for lacerations (Neurotmesis).

### Reconstructive Surgery (For Irreversible Paralysis)
Used for chronic claw hand where nerve recovery is impossible.
*   **Tendon Transfers:**
    *   **Principle:** To restore intrinsic muscle function (MCP flexion and IP extension).
    *   **Procedures:** [[Brand's operation]] (using ECRL or other extensors), [[Bunnell's procedure]] (using FDS), or [[Zancolli's capsulodesis]] (static procedure tightening the volar capsule),.
