# [[DEMOGRAPHY AND FAMILY PLANNING]] > A 28-year-old mother with children aged 4 year and 1 year, has come to you for family planning advice. Describe different methods of contraception that can be offered to her with merits and demerits.

Based on the profile of the patient (28-year-old, P2L2, last childbirth 1 year ago), she is an **Eligible Couple**,. Since she has two living children, she has two primary choices:
1.  **Spacing Methods:** If she desires to have more children later or wants to delay the decision of permanent sterilization.
2.  **Terminal Methods:** If she is satisfied with her family size (2 children is the ideal family norm).

The approach used here is the **[[Cafeteria Approach]]**,, where all available methods are explained, and the client chooses the best one suited to her needs. The counseling should follow the **GATHER** approach (Greet, Ask, Tell, Help, Explain, Return).

### A. Spacing Methods (Temporary)

#### 1. Intra-uterine Contraceptive Devices ([[IUCD]])
This is an ideal spacing method for this patient as she has one child >1 year old, meaning involution of the uterus is complete and she is accustomed to motherhood.
*   **Types:** [[Cu-T 380A]] (Effective for 10 years), [[Cu-T 375]] (Effective for 5 years).

| Merits | Demerits |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Long-term protection:** Once inserted, no attention needed for 5-10 years., | **Bleeding:** Increased menstrual blood loss is the *most common* side effect., |
| **Reversibility:** Fertility returns promptly upon removal., | **Pain:** Low backache or cramps (2nd most common side effect)., |
| **High Efficacy:** Failure rate is very low (0.5-2%). | **Expulsion:** Spontaneous expulsion can occur (5-15%)., |
| **Non-hormonal:** No systemic metabolic side effects. | **PID:** Risk of [[Pelvic Inflammatory Disease]]. |

**Clinical Relevance:** Ideally inserted within 10 days of the beginning of the menstrual period.

#### 2. Oral Contraceptive Pills ([[OCPs]])
Since the younger child is 1 year old, lactation is likely not exclusive; therefore, combined pills can be safely used.
*   **Types:** Combined Pills (Mala-N, Mala-D), [[Centchroman]] (Chhaya/Saheli).

| Merits | Demerits |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Effectiveness:** Almost 100% effective if taken regularly. | **Compliance:** Requires daily motivation (taking a pill every day). |
| **Regular Cycles:** Regulates menstruation and reduces dysmenorrhea. | **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, weight gain, headache, breast tenderness. |
| **Protection:** Protects against **Ovarian** and **Endometrial cancers**, and benign breast diseases. | **Cardiovascular Risk:** Small risk of hypertension or thromboembolism (esp. in smokers >35 yrs). |
| **Reversible:** Fertility returns shortly after stopping. | **Effect on Lactation:** Combined pills may decrease milk quantity (though less relevant after 1 year). |

**Centchroman ([[Chhaya]]/Saheli):**
*   *Merit:* Non-steroidal, **Once-a-week pill** (after first 3 months of bi-weekly use), fewer side effects than hormonal pills,.
*   *Demerit:* Can cause delayed menstruation in 8% of users.

#### 3. Injectable Contraceptives ([[Antara]] / DMPA)
*   **Drug:** Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (DMPA).
*   **Dose:** 150 mg IM every 3 months.

| Merits | Demerits |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Convenience:** Only 4 injections a year. No daily pills. | **Menstrual Chaos:** Disruption of cycle, irregular bleeding, or amenorrhea (absence of periods). |
| **Efficacy:** Highly effective (99%). | **Return of Fertility:** Fertility return is delayed (avg. 5.5 months) after discontinuation. |
| **Lactation:** Does not affect breast milk quality/quantity. | **Weight Gain:** Can cause weight increase. |

#### 4. Barrier Methods ([[Condoms]])
Suitable if the couple wants to space for a very short duration or has infrequent intercourse.

| Merits | Demerits |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Dual Protection:** Prevents pregnancy AND protects against **[[STIs]]/HIV**. | **Failure Rate:** Higher failure rate (2-14%) due to user error/slippage., |
| **No Side Effects:** Safe, no hormonal risks. | **Interference:** May interfere with sexual sensation or spontaneity. |
| **Accessibility:** Easily available (Social marketing - Nirodh). | **Disposal:** Issues with disposal and privacy. |

### B. Terminal Methods (Permanent)

Since the mother is 28 years old and has 2 living children (meeting the criteria of family size), she is eligible for sterilization if the couple decides they do not want more children.

#### 1. Female Sterilization ([[Tubectomy]])
*   **Techniques:** Mini-laparotomy or Laparoscopic sterilization.

| Merits | Demerits |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Permanent:** One-time procedure, no further action needed. | **Surgical Risk:** Small risk of infection, bleeding, or anesthesia complications. |
| **Cost-effective:** Most cost-effective in the long run. | **Irreversibility:** Reversal is difficult and expensive; regret is possible if life circumstances change. |

#### 2. Male Sterilization ([[Vasectomy]])
*   **Technique:** No-Scalpel Vasectomy (NSV).

| Merits | Demerits |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Safer:** Simpler, safer, and cheaper than female sterilization. | **Not Immediate:** Not effective immediately; requires barrier contraception for ~3 months (30 ejaculations) until azoospermia. |
| **No Incision:** NSV is practically painless with less recovery time. | **Psychological:** Myths regarding impotency or weakness (needs counseling). |
