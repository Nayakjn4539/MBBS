# [[Mechanical Injuries]] > simple hurt vs Grievious hurt

### **Hurt and Grievous Hurt**

In forensic traumatology, injuries are legally classified based on their severity into **Simple Hurt** and **Grievous Hurt**. The distinction is vital for determining the severity of the crime and the quantum of punishment for the accused.

---

### **1. Definition of Injury**
Under **[[Section 44 IPC]]** (Indian Penal Code), the word "Injury" denotes any harm whatever illegally caused to any person, in **Body, Mind, Reputation or Property**.

---

### **2. Hurt (Simple Hurt)**
defined under **[[Section 319 IPC]]** (Section 115 BNS).

**Definition:**
Whoever causes **bodily pain**, **disease** or **infirmity** to any person is said to cause hurt.
*   **Bodily pain:** Any physical pain.
*   **Disease:** Communicating an ailment (e.g., Syphilis).
*   **Infirmity:** Temporary mental impairment or hysteria caused by terror/shock.

**Key Features:**
*   It is not a threat to life.
*   It heals rapidly without permanent sequelae.
*   Examples: [[Abrasions]], superficial [[Contusions]], minor [[Lacerations]].

---

### **3. Grievous Hurt**
Defined under **[[Section 320 IPC]]** (Section 116 BNS).

This section specifically designates **8 clauses** of injuries as "Grievous". If an injury does not fall into one of these 8 specific categories, it cannot be labeled as grievous, regardless of how severe it looks.

#### **The 8 Clauses of Grievous Hurt:**

1.  **Emasculation:** Depriving a male of his masculine power (potency). Usually involves injury to testes or cutting of the penis.
2.  **Permanent Privation of Sight of either eye:** Blinding.
3.  **Permanent Privation of Hearing of either ear:** Deafness.
4.  **Privation of any Member or Joint:** Loss of a limb or distinct part of the body.
5.  **Destruction or Permanent Impairing of the powers of any Member or Joint:** The limb is physically present but functionally useless (e.g., paralysis of a hand due to nerve injury).
6.  **Permanent Disfiguration of the Head or Face:** Examples include cutting of the nose, deep incised wounds leaving ugly scars on the face, corneal opacity.
7.  **Fracture or Dislocation of a Bone or Tooth:**
    *   Any break in the continuity of bone (chip, fissure, crack) counts as a fracture.
    *   **Note:** A cut on the skin over a bone *without* fracture is simple hurt.
8.  **Any hurt which:**
    *   **Endangers life** (Imminent risk of death), OR
    *   Causes the sufferer to be in **severe bodily pain**, OR
    *   Unable to follow his **ordinary pursuits** for a period of **20 days** (IPC) / **15 days** (Under [[Section 116 BNS]]).

> **Mnemonic for Grievous Hurt (8 Clauses):**
> **"E P H D"** (Every Person Has Dreams)
> *   **E** - **E**masculation
> *   **P** - **P**rivation (Sight, Hearing, Member/Joint)
> *   **H** - **H**urt endangering life / 20 days pain
> *   **D** - **D**isfiguration (Head/Face), **D**estruction of power, **D**islocation/Fracture.

### **4. Difference: Simple Hurt vs Grievous Hurt**

| Feature | Simple Hurt | Grievous Hurt |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Legal Section (Definition)** | [[Section 319 IPC]] / Sec 115 BNS | [[Section 320 IPC]] / Sec 116 BNS |
| **Severity** | Non-serious, superficial. | Serious, often permanent or life-threatening. |
| **Nature of Injury** | Causes pain, disease, or infirmity only. | Falls strictly under the 8 specific clauses. |
| **Healing Time** | Usually heals rapidly (< 20 days). | Often takes > 20 days or leaves permanent damage. |
| **Danger to Life** | No danger to life. | May endanger life (Clause 8). |
| **Punishment Section** | **Sec 323 IPC** (Voluntarily causing hurt). | **Sec 325 IPC** (Voluntarily causing grievous hurt). |
| **Punishment Quantum** | Imprisonment up to 1 year or fine up to ₹1000 or both. | Imprisonment up to 7 years and fine. |
| **Bailability** | Bailable offence. | Usually non-bailable (Cognizable). |

### **5. Important Medico-Legal Concepts**

#### **A. Dangerous Injury vs Grievous Hurt**
While all dangerous injuries are grievous (Clause 8), not all grievous injuries are dangerous.
*   **Dangerous Injury:** An injury that poses an **imminent** danger to life (e.g., [[Stab wound]] penetrating the lung or [[Heart]]). If surgical aid is not provided, the death is almost certain.
*   **Grievous Hurt:** Includes injuries like corneal opacity or fracture of the little finger, which are serious legally but **do not** threaten life.

#### **B. Ordinary Pursuits**
*   Refers to the routine daily activities of the victim (bathing, feeding, walking).
*   If a person is hospitalized or bedridden due to pain for **20 days** (IPC) or **15 days** (BNS), the injury becomes grievous even if it was initially simple (e.g., a severe muscle strain).

#### **C. Role of the Doctor**
1.  **Documentation:** Precisely measure and describe wounds in the [[Wound Certificate]].
2.  **Opinion:** The doctor gives an *opinion* based on medical facts (e.g., "There is a fracture of the radius").
3.  **Classification:** The doctor classifies the injury as Simple or Grievous based on the findings (e.g., X-ray showing fracture).
4.  **Observation:** If the severity is unclear (e.g., head injury without immediate fracture but patient unconscious), keep the patient under observation. If they recover within 20 days without complications = Simple. If complications persist/danger to life arises = Grievous.

### **6. Punishment Table (IPC)**

| Intent | Weapon | Nature of Injury | Section IPC | Punishment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Voluntary | Blunt/Hand | **Simple** | 323 | 1 yr / ₹1000 |
| Voluntary | **Dangerous** | **Simple** | 324 | 3 yrs / Fine |
| Voluntary | Blunt/Hand | **Grievous** | 325 | 7 yrs + Fine |
| Voluntary | **Dangerous** | **Grievous** | 326 | Life / 10 yrs + Fine |

*Note: **Dangerous Weapons** include instruments for shooting, stabbing, cutting, or any instrument which used as a weapon of offence is likely to cause death (fire, poison, corrosive, explosives).*
