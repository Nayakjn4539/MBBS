# [[Principles Of Epidemiology And Epidemiologic Methods]] > Cohort Study

### **Cohort Study**

**Definition**
A **Cohort Study** is a type of [[Analytical Epidemiology]] (observational) study in which a group of individuals (cohort) who share a common characteristic or experience within a defined time period are identified and followed up over time to determine the incidence of disease or outcome.

*   **Unit of Study:** Individual
*   **Direction:** Forward-looking (Cause $\rightarrow$ Effect)
*   **Synonyms:** Prospective study, Longitudinal study, Incidence study, Forward-looking study.

### **Concept of Cohort**
A **Cohort** is a group of people who share a common characteristic or experience within a defined time period.
*   **Birth Cohort:** People born in the same year (e.g., all babies born in 2020).
*   **Exposure Cohort:** People exposed to a common drug, radiation, or occupation (e.g., Radiologists, Uranium miners).
*   **Marriage Cohort:** People married in the same year.

### **Indications**
1.  When there is **good evidence** of an association between exposure and disease (hypothesis generated by descriptive studies).
2.  When the **exposure is rare**, but the incidence of disease among the exposed is high (e.g., exposure to X-rays).
3.  When attrition (loss to follow-up) can be minimized.
4.  When ample funds and time are available.

### **Types of Cohort Studies**

| Type | Description | Temporal Relationship |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Prospective Cohort Study** (Current/Concurrent) | The outcome has **not yet occurred** when the study begins. The investigator follows the group into the future. | Study starts $\rightarrow$ Exposure measured $\rightarrow$ Follow-up $\rightarrow$ Disease occurs |
| **Retrospective Cohort Study** (Historical/Non-concurrent) | Both **exposure and outcome have already occurred** before the study begins. The investigator goes back in time (via records) to identify exposure and traces forward to the present for the outcome. | Exposure (Past) $\rightarrow$ Disease (Past/Present) $\rightarrow$ Study Starts (Present) |
| **Combined Cohort Study** (Ambispective) | Combines both retrospective and prospective elements. Cohort identified from past records and followed up prospectively. | Exposure (Past) $\rightarrow$ Study Starts $\rightarrow$ Follow-up $\rightarrow$ Disease (Future) |

### **Elements (Steps) of a Cohort Study**

**1. Selection of Study Subjects**
*   **General Population:** Whole population in a geographic area (e.g., [[Framingham Heart Study]]).
*   **Special Groups:** Select groups like doctors, lawyers, or insured persons (e.g., **Doll and Hill’s study** on British doctors and smoking).
*   **Exposure Groups:** Persons exposed to physical, chemical, or biological agents (e.g., Radiologists).

**2. Obtaining Data on Exposure**
*   Information collected through:
    *   Personal interviews/questionnaires.
    *   Review of records (medical/employment).
    *   Medical examinations (BP, Cholesterol).
    *   Environmental surveys.

**3. Selection of Comparison Groups**
*   **Internal Comparison:** The cohort is divided into subgroups based on exposure (e.g., Smokers vs. Non-smokers within the same cohort).
*   **External Comparison:** Used when the whole group is exposed. Compare with a similar outside group (e.g., Radiologists vs. Ophthalmologists).
*   **General Population:** Comparison with the mortality experience of the general population.

**4. Follow-up**
*   **Most critical step.**
*   Requires regular monitoring (periodic exams, mail, phone calls) to identify the onset of disease/outcome.
*   **Major Problem:** [[Attrition]] (Loss to follow-up). Losses >10% can affect validity; >20% makes the study questionable.

**5. Analysis**
*   Calculation of **Incidence Rates**.
*   Estimation of Risk (**Relative Risk**, **Attributable Risk**).

### **Analysis of Cohort Study**

**2x2 Contingency Table for Cohort Study**

| Exposure | Disease Developed (Yes) | Disease Not Developed (No) | Total |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Exposed** | $a$ | $b$ | $a + b$ |
| **Non-Exposed** | $c$ | $d$ | $c + d$ |

**1. Incidence Rates**
*   **Incidence among Exposed ($I_{exp}$):** $a / (a+b)$
*   **Incidence among Non-Exposed ($I_{non-exp}$):** $c / (c+d)$

**2. Estimation of Risk (Strength of Association)**

*   **Relative Risk (RR) / Risk Ratio:**
    *   Formula: $$RR = \frac{\text{Incidence among Exposed}}{\text{Incidence among Non-Exposed}} = \frac{I_{exp}}{I_{non-exp}}$$
    *   **Interpretation:**
        *   $RR = 1$: No association.
        *   $RR > 1$: Positive association (Causal). e.g., RR of 10 means smokers are 10 times more likely to get cancer.
        *   $RR < 1$: Negative association (Protective factor).

*   **Attributable Risk (AR):**
    *   Formula: $$AR = \frac{I_{exp} - I_{non-exp}}{I_{exp}} \times 100$$
    *   **Interpretation:** Indicates how much of the disease in the exposed group is *attributed* to the exposure. Used for clinical impact.

*   **Population Attributable Risk (PAR):**
    *   Formula: $$PAR = \frac{I_{total} - I_{non-exp}}{I_{total}} \times 100$$
    *   **Interpretation:** Suggests the reduction in disease incidence in the *total population* if the risk factor were eliminated. Useful for public health policy.

### **Advantages vs. Disadvantages**

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :--- | :--- |
| Can calculate **Incidence** directly. | **Expensive** and time-consuming. |
| Can calculate **Relative Risk** (Direct strength of association). | **Attrition** (Loss to follow-up) is a major bias. |
| Establishes **Temporality** (Cause precedes effect). | Not suitable for **Rare Diseases**. |
| Can study **Multiple Outcomes** from a single exposure. | Study behavior may alter due to observation ([[Hawthorne Effect]]). |
| Good for **Rare Exposures** (e.g., atomic bomb survivors). | Ethical problems (cannot expose people to harmful agents deliberately). |
| Minimizes **Recall Bias**. | Latency period of disease may be very long. |

### **Biases in Cohort Study**
1.  **Selection Bias:** If the exposed and non-exposed groups are not comparable.
2.  **Follow-up Bias (Attrition Bias):** Loss of participants affects the outcome validity.
3.  **Information Bias:** Error in measuring exposure or outcome.
4.  **Hawthorne Effect:** Subjects change behavior because they know they are being observed.
5.  **Healthy Worker Effect:** In occupational cohorts, workers are generally healthier than the general population.

### **Mnemonic for Advantages**
**"TEMPO"**
*   **T**emporality (Best study for this)
*   **E**xposure (Good for rare exposures)
*   **M**ultiple outcomes
*   **P**owerful (Strongest observational evidence)
*   **O**utcomes (Calculates Incidence and Relative Risk)
