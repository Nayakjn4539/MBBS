# [[Nerve Injuries]] > Median Nerve Injury

# Median Nerve Injury

The [[Median Nerve]], often termed the "Labourer's Nerve", is formed by the union of lateral and medial cords of the [[Brachial Plexus]] (Root Value: C5, C6, C7, C8, T1). It is a mixed nerve supplying most of the flexor muscles in the forearm and the thenar muscles in the hand.

### Anatomy and Supply

*   **Motor Supply:**
    *   **Forearm:** Supplies all superficial and deep muscles of the anterior compartment **EXCEPT** the [[Flexor Carpi Ulnaris]] (FCU) and the medial half of the [[Flexor Digitorum Profundus]] (FDP), which are supplied by the [[Ulnar Nerve]],.
    *   **Hand:** Supplies the **LOAF** muscles:
        *   **L**: Lateral two [[Lumbricals]] (1st and 2nd).
        *   **O**: [[Opponens Pollicis]].
        *   **A**: [[Abductor Pollicis Brevis]] (APB).
        *   **F**: [[Flexor Pollicis Brevis]] (Superficial head).
*   **Sensory Supply:**
    *   **Palmar aspect:** Lateral $3\frac{1}{2}$ digits (Thumb, Index, Middle, and radial half of Ring finger).
    *   **Dorsal aspect:** Tips of the same lateral $3\frac{1}{2}$ digits.
    *   **Autonomous Zone:** Tip of the [[Index Finger]].

### Classification by Level of Injury

Injuries are broadly classified based on the level of the lesion: **High Median Nerve Palsy** (at or proximal to the elbow) and **Low Median Nerve Palsy** (at the wrist).

#### 1. High Median Nerve Palsy (Injury at Elbow/Arm)
*   **Common Causes:**
    *   [[Supracondylar Fracture of Humerus]].
    *   Elbow dislocation.
    *   Tourniquet palsy.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Motor Loss:** Paralysis of forearm flexors (Pronator teres, FCR, FDS) and lateral half of FDP. Paralysis of thenar muscles.
    *   **Sensory Loss:** Complete loss over the lateral $3\frac{1}{2}$ digits and lateral palm.
    *   **Deformity:**
        *   **Pointing Index (Benediction Sign/Oschner’s Clasp):** When the patient is asked to clasp hands or make a fist, the index and middle fingers remain straight (fail to flex). This is due to paralysis of the [[Flexor Digitorum Superficialis]] (FDS) and lateral half of [[Flexor Digitorum Profundus]] (FDP),.
        *   The Ring and Little fingers can flex because their FDP supply (Ulnar nerve) is intact.

#### 2. Low Median Nerve Palsy (Injury at Wrist)
*   **Common Causes:**
    *   Cut injuries (e.g., suicide attempts, glass cuts) at the wrist.
    *   [[Lunate Dislocation]].
    *   [[Carpal Tunnel Syndrome]] (Compression neuropathy).
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Motor Loss:** Forearm muscles are **spared**. Only intrinsic muscles of the hand (LOAF) are paralyzed.
    *   **Sensory Loss:** Loss over lateral $3\frac{1}{2}$ digits. Sensation over the thenar eminence may be spared if the palmar cutaneous branch (arising proximal to the carpal tunnel) is intact.
    *   **Deformity:**
        *   **Ape Thumb Deformity (Simian Hand):** Wasting of the [[Thenar Eminence]] leads to a flattened palm. The thumb lies in the same plane as the palm (adducted and extended) due to the unopposed action of the [[Adductor Pollicis]] (Ulnar n.) and [[Extensor Pollicis Longus]] (Radial n.),.
        *   Loss of **Opposition** movement.

#### 3. Anterior Interosseous Nerve (AIN) Injury
*   **Nature:** The AIN is a purely motor branch of the Median nerve arising in the forearm.
*   **Muscles Supplied:**
    *   [[Flexor Pollicis Longus]] (FPL).
    *   Lateral half of [[Flexor Digitorum Profundus]] (FDP) (Index finger).
    *   [[Pronator Quadratus]].
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **No Sensory Loss**.
    *   **Kiloh-Nevin Sign (Weak "OK" Sign):** Patient cannot make a perfect 'O' with the thumb and index finger. Instead, they form a "pincer grasp" (pad-to-pad contact instead of tip-to-tip) due to inability to flex the distal interphalangeal joints,.

### Clinical Tests for Median Nerve

| Test Name | Muscle Tested | Procedure | Positive Finding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pen Test** | [[Abductor Pollicis Brevis]] (APB) | Patient lays hand flat, palm up. Asked to touch a pen held above the thumb by abducting it vertically,. | Inability to raise the thumb to touch the pen. |
| **Oschner’s Clasp Test** | FDS & Lateral FDP | Patient clasps hands together,. | Index finger fails to flex (**Pointing Index**). |
| **Phalen’s Test** | - | Maximum wrist flexion for 60 seconds. | Tingling/Numbness in median distribution (Suggests [[Carpal Tunnel Syndrome]]). |
| **Tinel’s Sign** | - | Percussion over the nerve at the wrist. | Electric shock sensation/tingling. |

### Comparison of High vs. Low Lesion

| Feature | High Median Nerve Palsy (Elbow) | Low Median Nerve Palsy (Wrist) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Forearm Flexors** | Paralyzed | Spared (Normal) |
| **Pointing Index** | **Present** (Benediction Sign) | Absent (FDP/FDS intact) |
| **Ape Thumb** | Present | **Present** |
| **Sensory Loss** | Lateral 3.5 digits + Lateral Palm | Lateral 3.5 digits (Palm may be spared) |
| **Opposition** | Lost | Lost |

### Management

#### 1. Conservative Management
*   Indicated for closed injuries (e.g., neurapraxia, axonotmesis) or early Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.
*   **Splinting:**
    *   **Opponens Splint:** Keeps the thumb in abduction and opposition to prevent contracture of the adductor pollicis.
    *   **Cock-up Splint:** Used if there is associated radial nerve injury or to maintain functional position.

#### 2. Operative Management
*   **Indications:** Open injuries (Neurotmesis), failure of conservative care, or severe compression.
*   **Nerve Repair:**
    *   Primary repair (Epineural suture) for clean cuts.
    *   Nerve grafting (e.g., [[Sural Nerve]]) for gaps.
*   **Tendon Transfers:** Performed for irreversible paralysis (old injuries) to restore opposition.
    *   **Opponensplasty:** Transfer of [[Flexor Digitorum Superficialis]] (FDS) of the ring finger (standard procedure) or Extensor Indicis to restore thumb opposition.
