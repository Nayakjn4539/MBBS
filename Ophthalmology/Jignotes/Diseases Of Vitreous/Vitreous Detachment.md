# Vitreous Detachment

[[Vitreous detachment]] refers to the separation of the [[cortical vitreous]] from the underlying [[neurosensory retina]] (specifically the internal limiting membrane). While the vitreous is firmly attached at the [[vitreous base]], separations usually occur posterior to this point.

## Anatomy and Pathophysiology

To understand detachment, one must understand the normal aging process of the vitreous body:

1.  **Normal State:** The vitreous is a hydrophilic gel composed of 99% water and a network of [[collagen fibrils]] (Type II) interspersed with [[hyaluronic acid]] molecules.
2.  **Vitreous Attachments:** (In decreasing order of strength)
    *   **[[Vitreous base]]** (Strongest; 3-4 mm zone across [[ora serrata]]).
    *   **[[Optic disc]]** (Weiss ring).
    *   **[[Macula]]** / [[Fovea]].
    *   **[[Retinal blood vessels]]**.
3.  **Aging Process:**
    *   **[[Synchysis]] (Liquefaction):** Depolymerization of hyaluronic acid and collapse of the collagen network converts the gel into sol (fluid).
    *   **[[Syneresis]] (Collapse):** The liquefied vitreous shrinks.
    *   **Detachment:** Fluid enters through a breach in the posterior hyaloid membrane into the retro-hyaloid space, separating the vitreous cortex from the retina.

## Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD)

[[Posterior Vitreous Detachment]] is the separation of the cortical vitreous from the retina anywhere posterior to the vitreous base.

### Epidemiology and Risk Factors
PVD is a common senile phenomenon but occurs earlier or more frequently in:
*   **Age:** >65 years (Common).
*   **Refractive Error:** High [[Myopia]].
*   **Lens Status:** [[Aphakia]] or [[Pseudophakia]].
*   **Trauma:** Blunt or perforating injuries.
*   **Inflammation:** [[Uveitis]] (Post-inflammatory liquefaction).
*   **Systemic Disease:** [[Diabetes mellitus]].

### Clinical Features

#### Symptoms
Patients often present with acute onset of:
1.  **[[Floaters]] (Muscae Volitantes):**
    *   Sudden appearance of moving spots, cobwebs, or a "fly" in the visual field.
    *   Caused by condensed vitreous fibers, the detached peripapillary glial tissue ([[Weiss ring]]), or mild [[vitreous hemorrhage]].
2.  **[[Photopsia]] (Flashes of Light):**
    *   Subjective sensation of lightning streaks, usually in the temporal field.
    *   Caused by mechanical traction of the separating vitreous on the [[neuroepithelium]] during eye movements.
    *   **Clinical Implication:** Presence of flashes suggests dynamic [[vitreoretinal traction]] and requires careful exclusion of retinal breaks.

#### Signs
*   **[[Weiss Ring]] (Fuchs Ring):** A ring-like opacity suspended in the vitreous cavity. It represents the detached glial tissue from the margin of the [[optic disc]]. This is **pathognomonic** of PVD.
*   **Collapsed Vitreous:** Seen on dynamic slit-lamp biomicroscopy.
*   **Retro-hyaloid Space:** An optically clear space seen between the detached posterior hyaloid face and the retina.
*   **[[Shaffer's Sign]] (Tobacco Dust):** Presence of pigment cells in the anterior vitreous.
    *   **Clinical Implication:** This is highly suggestive of a [[retinal tear]] or [[retinal detachment]] associated with the PVD.

### Complications of PVD
While uncomplicated PVD is benign, traction at sites of firm adhesion can lead to serious sequelae:

| Complication | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Retinal Break]] / Tear** | Traction at sites of strong adhesion (e.g., lattice degeneration). Most common in the **superotemporal** quadrant. |
| **[[Vitreous Hemorrhage]]** | Avulsion of a retinal blood vessel during separation. |
| **[[Retinal Detachment]]** | Fluid vitreous passes through a retinal break (Rhegmatogenous RD). |
| **[[Macular Hole]]** | Traction on the fovea during separation. |
| **[[Epiretinal Membrane]]** | Proliferation of glial cells on the retinal surface (Macular pucker). |
| **[[Cystoid Macular Edema]]** | Secondary to tractional irritation. |

### Management
1.  **Detailed Examination:**
    *   **[[Indirect Ophthalmoscopy]]** with **scleral indentation** is mandatory to visualize the peripheral retina and rule out retinal breaks.
    *   Slit-lamp biomicroscopy with a +90D or +78D lens to assess the macula and disc.
2.  **Uncomplicated PVD:**
    *   No treatment required.
    *   **Patient Education:** Reassurance that floaters usually settle/brain adapts.
    *   **Warning Symptoms:** Instruct patient to return immediately if they experience:
        *   Sudden increase in floaters (shower of spots).
        *   New/persistent flashing lights.
        *   A curtain/shadow obscuring vision (indicative of RD).
3.  **Complicated PVD:**
    *   **Retinal Tear:** Prophylactic [[Laser photocoagulation]] or [[Cryotherapy]] to seal the break and prevent detachment.
    *   **Vitreous Hemorrhage:** B-scan USG if fundus not visible; bed rest; vitrectomy if non-resolving.
    *   **Retinal Detachment:** Surgical repair (Scleral buckling/Vitrectomy).

## Anterior and Basal Vitreous Detachment

*   **Definition:** Separation of the vitreous base or the anterior hyaloid face.
*   **Etiology:** Almost exclusively caused by severe blunt [[ocular trauma]].
*   **Associations:**
    *   Often associated with [[Retinal dialysis]] (disinsertion of retina at ora serrata).
    *   [[Lens dislocation]] or subluxation.
    *   [[Vitreous hemorrhage]].
