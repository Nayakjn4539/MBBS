Kidney Pathology Review


| Disease Name+definition | Etiology | Risk factors | Pathogenesis and stages | Genes and mutations involved | Gross Morphology | Microscopic features+special stains+identification | Clinical Manifestations | Diagnostic markers | Classification of types if any | Complications or associated disorders | Treatment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Nephritic syndrome** A clinical syndrome caused by inflammatory glomerular disease, characterized by acute onset of hematuria, diminished GFR, mild to moderate proteinuria, and hypertension. | Caused by inflammatory glomerular diseases like acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. It involves proliferation of cells within the glomeruli, often with a leukocytic infiltrate. | - | Inflammatory reaction severely injures capillary walls, allowing blood to pass into the urine. It induces hemodynamic changes that lead to a reduction in GFR. The reduced GFR manifests as oliguria and fluid retention. Hypertension results from fluid retention and renin release from ischemic kidneys. | - | - | Lesions show proliferation of cells within the glomeruli, accompanied by an inflammatory leukocytic infiltrate. | Characterized by:  • **Hematuria** (grossly visible or microscopic with dysmorphic red cells and red cell casts) • **Oliguria** • **Azotemia** • **Hypertension** • Mild to moderate **proteinuria** (subnephrotic range) with or without edema. | Red blood cells and red cell casts in urine. | Classic presentation of acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, crescentic GN, and proliferative lupus GN. | Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is a form where there is rapid decline in GFR. | - |
| **Acute Proliferative Glomerulonephritis (Postinfectious and Infection-Associated)** A disease characterized histologically by diffuse proliferation of glomerular cells with leukocyte influx, typically caused by immune complexes following an infection. | Immune complex mediated. Prototypical cause is infection with group A β-hemolytic streptococci (types 12, 4, 1). Can also be caused by other bacteria (staphylococci), viruses (HBV, HCV, HIV), and parasites (malaria). The antigen is often exogenous (e.g., bacterial proteins). | Recent streptococcal infection of pharynx or skin (impetigo). More common in children 6-10 years old. Overcrowding and poor hygiene are risk factors for skin infections. | 1. A latent period of 1-4 weeks after infection for antibody production.  2. Formation of immune complexes involving the inciting antigen (**streptococcal pyogenic exotoxin B - SpeB**).  3. Antigens are planted in subendothelial locations, leading to in situ immune complex formation.  4. Antigen-antibody complexes dissociate, migrate across the GBM, and reform on the subepithelial side.  5. These complexes activate complement and elicit an inflammatory response. | - | Enlarged, hypercellular glomeruli. | **Light Microscopy**: Diffuse endocapillary proliferation with infiltration by neutrophils and monocytes. Swelling of endothelial cells. In severe cases, crescents. Tubules may contain red cell casts. **Immunofluorescence**: Granular deposits of IgG, C3, and sometimes IgM in the mesangium and along the GBM.  **Electron Microscopy**: Discrete, amorphous, electron-dense deposits on the epithelial side of the membrane, appearing as subepithelial "**humps**". | Typical onset in a child 1-2 weeks after a sore throat.  • Abrupt onset of malaise, fever, nausea.  • Oliguria and hematuria (smoky or cola-colored urine). • Dysmorphic red cells or red cell casts in urine. • Mild proteinuria (<1 g/day). • Periorbital edema and mild to moderate hypertension.  Adult onset is often atypical. | Elevated antistreptococcal antibody (ASO) titers. Decline in serum concentration of C3. | - | A small minority of children and a larger proportion of adults may develop a rapidly progressive form of GN (RPGN) or progress to chronic glomerulonephritis. | Conservative therapy aimed at maintaining sodium and water balance. Most children (>95%) recover. |
| **Crescentic Glomerulonephritis (Rapidly Progressive) (RPGN)** A clinical syndrome with features of nephritic syndrome and rapid, progressive loss of renal function. Histologically defined by the presence of crescents in most glomeruli. | Immunologically mediated glomerular injury. Etiology depends on the type. | Exposure to viruses or hydrocarbon solvents (in anti-GBM disease). Genetic predisposition (certain HLA alleles, e.g., **HLA-DRB1**). | Severe glomerular injury, leading to breaks in the GBM. This allows leakage of plasma proteins (like coagulation factors and fibrin) and inflammatory mediators into Bowman's space. This triggers the proliferation of parietal epithelial cells and infiltration of monocytes/macrophages, which form the characteristic **crescents** that compress the glomerular tuft. | The antigen in anti-GBM disease is a peptide within the noncollagenous (NC1) portion of the α3 chain of type IV collagen. | Kidneys are enlarged and pale, often with petechial hemorrhages on the cortical surfaces. | **Light Microscopy**: The defining feature is the presence of distinctive **crescents** in most glomeruli. Crescents consist of proliferating glomerular epithelial cells and infiltrating monocytes/macrophages. Fibrin strands are prominent. Focal and segmental necrosis is often present. **Electron Microscopy**: May show ruptures in the GBM. **Immunofluorescence**: Varies by type. | Presents with features of nephritic syndrome: hematuria with red blood cell casts, moderate proteinuria, variable hypertension and edema. Characterized by rapid and progressive decline in renal function. In Goodpasture syndrome, recurrent hemoptysis may dominate. | • **Type I**: Serum anti-GBM antibodies. • **Type III**: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (**ANCAs**), either c-ANCA (PR3-ANCA) or p-ANCA (MPO-ANCA). | **Type I (Anti-GBM Antibody)**: Linear IgG and C3 deposits. Includes Goodpasture syndrome and renal-limited disease. **Type II (Immune Complex)**: Granular immune deposits. Can be a complication of postinfectious GN, lupus nephritis, IgA nephropathy. **Type III (Pauci-Immune)**: Lack of immune deposits. Most patients have ANCA. Can be idiopathic or part of a systemic vasculitis (e.g., GPA, microscopic polyangiitis). | If untreated, death from renal failure may occur within weeks to months. In Goodpasture syndrome, life-threatening pulmonary hemorrhage can occur. | Treatment includes steroids, cytotoxic agents, and, for anti-GBM disease, intensive plasmapheresis. |
| **Nephrotic Syndrome** A clinical syndrome caused by derangement in glomerular capillary walls resulting in increased permeability to plasma proteins. | Caused by glomerular diseases that damage the filtration barrier. Primary causes include minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and membranous nephropathy. Systemic diseases like diabetes mellitus, amyloidosis, and SLE are also major causes. | - | Increased glomerular permeability (due to structural or charge-barrier alterations) → **Massive proteinuria** → **Hypoalbuminemia** (as loss exceeds liver's synthetic capacity) → Decreased intravascular colloid osmotic pressure → **Generalized edema**. Hypovolemia also stimulates renin-aldosterone system, contributing to sodium and water retention. Hyperlipidemia is due to increased hepatic synthesis of lipoproteins and decreased lipid catabolism. | - | - | Morphology depends on the underlying disease. A common feature in many cases is effacement of podocyte foot processes. Proximal tubules often contain protein and lipid reabsorption droplets. | Characterized by a tetrad of findings:  1. **Massive proteinuria** (>3.5 g/day)  2. **Hypoalbuminemia** (<3 g/dL)  3. **Generalized edema** (soft and pitting, characteristically periorbital)  4. **Hyperlipidemia** and **lipiduria** (oval fat bodies in urine). | Proteinuria > 3.5g/24h. Hypoalbuminemia. Oval fat bodies in urine. | - | Vulnerability to staphylococcal and pneumococcal infections (due to loss of Igs). Thrombotic and thromboembolic complications (due to loss of anticoagulants like antithrombin III), including renal vein thrombosis. | Treatment depends on the underlying cause. |
| **Membranous Nephropathy** A disease of chronic immune complex deposition, characterized by diffuse thickening of the glomerular capillary wall due to accumulation of Ig-containing deposits along the subepithelial side of the basement membrane. | • **Primary (Idiopathic) (~75%)**: Autoimmune disease caused by antibodies to a renal autoantigen. • **Secondary**: Associated with drugs (penicillamine, gold, NSAIDs), malignant tumors (lung, colon), SLE, infections (HBV, HCV, syphilis), thyroiditis. | Rheumatoid arthritis treated with penicillamine/gold. Malignancy. SLE. Chronic infections. | Autoantibody binds to its antigen (e.g., PLA₂R) on the podocyte surface. This is followed by complement activation (especially the **C5b-C9** membrane attack complex). C5b-C9 activates epithelial and mesangial cells to liberate proteases and oxidants, which cause capillary wall injury and increased protein leakage. The immune aggregates shed to form subepithelial deposits. | The primary form is an autoimmune disease against antigens on podocytes. The main target antigen is the **M-type phospholipase A₂ receptor (PLA₂R)**. Less common antigens include **thrombospondin type-1 domain-containing 7A (THSD7A)**. | - | **Light Microscopy**: Diffuse, uniform thickening of the glomerular capillary wall. Silver stains show irregular "**spikes**" of basement membrane material protruding between immune deposits. **Immunofluorescence**: Diffuse granular deposits of IgG (mainly IgG4) and C3 along the GBM.  **Electron Microscopy**: Irregular, electron-dense, subepithelial deposits with effacement of overlying podocyte foot processes. | Presents with insidious onset of nephrotic syndrome. Non-nephrotic proteinuria in 15% of cases. Hematuria and mild hypertension may be present. Proteinuria is nonselective. Course is variable but generally indolent. | Circulating antibodies to **PLA₂R** and **THSD7A**. | Primary vs. Secondary forms. | Progression to ESRD in ~40% of patients over time, associated with increasing sclerosis of glomeruli. Disease may recur in renal allografts. | Proteinuria does not respond well to corticosteroid therapy. Treatment of underlying condition in secondary forms. Immunosuppressive therapy is used in some cases. |
| **Minimal Change Disease** A relatively benign disorder characterized by diffuse effacement of podocyte foot processes, detectable only by electron microscopy, in glomeruli that appear normal by light microscopy. Also called lipoid nephrosis. | Most frequent cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. Pathogenesis is unclear but an immune basis is suspected. It sometimes follows a respiratory infection or prophylactic immunization. Associated with atopic disorders (eczema, rhinitis) and Hodgkin lymphoma. | Respiratory infections. Prophylactic immunizations. Atopic disorders. Hodgkin lymphoma. NSAID therapy. | The leading hypothesis is that an immune dysfunction (possibly involving T cells) leads to the production of circulating factors that damage visceral epithelial cells (podocytes) and cause proteinuria. This is considered a primary **podocytopathy**. The ultrastructural changes suggest a primary injury to the podocyte, possibly involving loss of glomerular polyanions (defects in the charge barrier). | - | Glomeruli are normal. | **Light Microscopy**: Glomeruli are normal. Cells of proximal tubules are often laden with lipid and protein. **Immunofluorescence**: Negative for Ig and complement deposits. **Electron Microscopy**: The principal and diagnostic lesion is **uniform and diffuse effacement ("fusion") of the foot processes** of the podocytes, with loss of slit diaphragms. | Presents with nephrotic syndrome. Renal function remains good, and there is commonly no hypertension or hematuria. The proteinuria is highly selective (mostly albumin). The key feature is a dramatic response to corticosteroid therapy. | - | - | In adults, can be associated with Hodgkin lymphoma and other lymphomas/leukemias. May follow NSAID therapy. Proteinuria can recur. | Corticosteroid therapy is highly effective (>90% response in children). Other immunosuppressive drugs for resistant cases. |
| **Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)** A lesion characterized by sclerosis and hyalinosis in some glomeruli (focal) and, in affected glomeruli, only a portion of the capillary tuft (segmental). It is a primary disorder of podocytes. | Primary (idiopathic) FSGS is most common. Also occurs in association with other known conditions (HIV, heroin use, morbid obesity), as a secondary scarring event, as an adaptive response to renal tissue loss, or in inherited forms. | HIV infection. Heroin addiction. Sickle cell disease. Morbid obesity. Unilateral renal agenesis. Reflux nephropathy. Hypertension. Individuals of African descent (due to APOL1 variants). | The central event is injury to podocytes (**podocytopathy**). This can be caused by unknown circulating factors, or genetic defects. This damage leads to epithelial cell degeneration and effacement of foot processes. The hyalinosis and sclerosis result from entrapment of plasma proteins in hyperpermeable areas and increased ECM deposition. In \*\*renal ablation FSGS\*\*, loss of renal mass leads to compensatory hypertrophy and hypertension in remaining glomeruli, causing endothelial and epithelial injury, and subsequent sclerosis. | Inherited forms are caused by mutations in genes for slit diaphragm proteins: • **NPHS1** (nephrin) - congenital nephrotic syndrome of Finnish type. • **NPHS2** (podocin) - steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome of childhood. • **ACTN4** (α-actinin 4) - autosomal dominant FSGS. • **TRPC6** - adult-onset FSGS. Increased risk of FSGS and renal failure in individuals of African descent is strongly associated with two variants (G1/G2) in the **apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1)**. | - | **Light Microscopy**: Involves a minority of glomeruli (focal) initially. Sclerotic segments show collapse of capillary loops, increase in matrix, and deposition of plasma proteins (hyalinosis). Lipid droplets and foam cells are often present. **Immunofluorescence**: IgM and C3 may be present in sclerotic areas. **Electron Microscopy**: Diffuse effacement of foot processes in both sclerotic and nonsclerotic areas. Focal detachment of epithelial cells may be seen. | Presents with nephrotic syndrome (most common cause in adults in US) or non-nephrotic proteinuria. Higher incidence of hematuria, reduced GFR, and hypertension compared to minimal change disease. Proteinuria is non-selective. Poor response to corticosteroids. | - | • Idiopathic FSGS • Secondary FSGS (e.g., HIV-associated, heroin nephropathy, ablation nephropathy) • Inherited forms • Morphologic variant: **Collapsing glomerulopathy** (retraction of tuft, hypertrophy of visceral epithelial cells), which has a poor prognosis. | Progression to chronic kidney disease, with at least 50% developing ESRD within 10 years. Recurrence in renal allografts is common (25-50%). | Poor response to corticosteroids. Treatment with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system can ameliorate progression of sclerosis. |
| **HIV-Associated Nephropathy** A renal complication of HIV infection, most commonly manifesting as a severe form of the collapsing variant of FSGS. | Direct or indirect effects of HIV infection on the kidney. | HIV infection. More frequent and severe in black individuals. | Pathogenesis is unclear, but may be primarily due to the presence of **APOL1** risk alleles. Some data suggest that HIV can infect tubular epithelial cells and podocytes directly. | Strongly associated with **G1/G2 risk alleles** for the **APOL1** gene. | - | Key features are: • A high frequency of the **collapsing variant of FSGS**. • Striking focal cystic dilation of tubule segments, filled with proteinaceous material. • Presence of large numbers of **tubuloreticular inclusions** within endothelial cells (detected by EM). | Presents as a severe form of FSGS, often with rapid progression to renal failure. | - | - | Poor prognosis, with rapid progression to end-stage renal disease. | Antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection has much reduced the incidence of this lesion. |
| **Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis (MPGN)** A pattern of immune-mediated injury characterized by alterations in the GBM, proliferation of glomerular cells, and leukocyte infiltration. Also called mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis. | **Type I (most cases)** is caused by deposition of circulating immune complexes. It can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to chronic immune complex disorders (SLE), infections (HCV, HBV, endocarditis), or malignant diseases. | Hepatitis C and B virus infection, SLE, lymphoid tumors. | In Type I, there is evidence of immune complexes in the glomerulus and activation of both classical and alternative complement pathways. Antigens (e.g., from viruses) are either "planted" in the glomerulus or part of preformed circulating complexes that deposit there, inciting an inflammatory response. | - | - | **Light Microscopy**: Glomeruli are large, hypercellular, and have an accentuated "lobular" appearance due to mesangial cell proliferation. GBM is thickened and often shows a "**double-contour**" or "**tram-track**" appearance on silver or PAS stains, caused by duplication of the basement membrane with interposition of cellular elements. **Immunofluorescence (Type I)**: IgG and C3 are deposited in a granular pattern. **Electron Microscopy (Type I)**: Discrete subendothelial electron-dense deposits. | Most patients present in adolescence or young adulthood with nephrotic syndrome, often with a nephritic component (hematuria). Some present with mild proteinuria or hematuria. | - | The main type discussed is now called **immune-complex MPGN** (formerly type I). Another major category, formerly type II, is now called **Dense Deposit Disease** and is considered a C3 glomerulopathy. | Slowly progressive and unremitting course. About 50% develop chronic renal failure within 10 years. Some patients develop crescents and RPGN. | Treatments with steroids, immunosuppressive agents, and antiplatelet drugs have not proven to be of any benefit. |
| **Dense Deposit Disease** A form of C3 glomerulopathy, formerly called MPGN type II, defined by a unique permeation of GBMs by electron dense material. | Caused by abnormalities resulting in excessive activation of the alternative complement pathway. This can be acquired (autoantibodies) or genetic (mutations in regulatory proteins). | - | Most patients have a circulating autoantibody called **C3 nephritic factor (C3NeF)**. C3NeF binds and stabilizes the alternative pathway C3 convertase (C3bBb), protecting it from inactivation by regulators like Factor H. This leads to persistent C3 activation, consumption, and hypocomplementemia. Mutations in complement regulatory genes can also lead to this dysregulation. | Associated with mutations in components of the alternate complement pathway, such as **Factor H**. | - | **Light Microscopy**: Similar to MPGN, with mesangial proliferation and "tram-track" appearance. **Immunofluorescence**: C3 is present in irregular granular or linear foci in basement membranes and in mesangial rings. IgG is usually absent. **Electron Microscopy**: The defining feature is the permeation of the lamina densa of the GBM by a **ribbonlike, homogeneous, extremely electron-dense material** of unknown composition. | Affects primarily children and young adults. Clinical presentation overlaps with MPGN, with nephritic syndrome and/or nephrotic syndrome. | Consistently decreased serum C3, but normal C1 and C4. Presence of **C3NeF** in serum. | This is a key entity within the group of **C3 glomerulopathies**. | Poor prognosis, with over half of patients progressing to ESRD. High incidence of recurrence in transplant recipients. | - |
| **Diabetic Nephropathy** Renal disease caused by diabetes mellitus, the leading cause of chronic kidney failure in the United States. | Diabetes mellitus (Type 1 and Type 2). | Diabetes. | Involves both metabolic pathways (e.g., nonenzymatic glycosylation of proteins, formation of advanced glycation end products) and hemodynamic changes (glomerular hypertension). These lead to GBM thickening, podocyte injury, and progressive expansion of the mesangial matrix, eventually leading to glomerulosclerosis. | - | - | Three main lesions: 1. **Glomerular lesions**: Capillary basement membrane thickening; diffuse mesangial sclerosis; and nodular glomerulosclerosis, characterized by ball-like deposits of matrix called **Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions** (pathognomonic). 2. **Renal vascular lesions**: Arteriolosclerosis (both afferent and efferent arterioles). 3. **Pyelonephritis**: Often with papillary necrosis. | Initial presentation is often microalbuminuria, which progresses to overt proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome. There is a slow decline in GFR, eventually leading to end-stage renal disease. Hypertension is common. | Persistent albuminuria. | - | End-stage renal disease. Increased susceptibility to pyelonephritis and papillary necrosis. | Glycemic control, blood pressure control (often with ACE inhibitors or ARBs). |
| **Fibrillary Glomerulonephritis** A rare disease characterized by fibrillary deposits in the mesangium and glomerular capillary walls that superficially resemble amyloid fibrils but are Congo red-negative. | Unknown etiology. | - | Pathogenesis is unknown. | - | - | **Light Microscopy**: Often shows mesangioproliferative or membranoproliferative patterns. **Special Stains**: Fibrils do not stain with **Congo red**. **Immunofluorescence**: Selective deposition of polyclonal IgG (often IgG4 subclass) and C3. **Identification**: Ultrastructurally distinct from amyloid fibrils. | Patients develop nephrotic syndrome, hematuria, and progressive renal insufficiency. | **DNAJB9** has been identified as a highly sensitive and specific marker. | - | Progressive renal insufficiency. The disease recurs in kidney transplants. | - |
| **IgA nephropathy (Berger Disease)** The most common type of glomerulonephritis worldwide, characterized by prominent IgA deposits in the mesangial regions and recurrent hematuria. | Deposition of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 in the mesangium. Both hereditary and environmental factors play a role. Increased synthesis of abnormal IgA may occur in response to respiratory or GI exposure to antigens. | Genetic influence (HLA, complement genotypes). Gluten enteropathy (celiac disease). Liver disease. | A "**multi-hit**" pathogenesis:  1. A defect leads to increased plasma levels of **aberrantly glycosylated polymeric IgA1** (lacking galactose in O-linked glycans of hinge region).  2. IgG autoantibodies form against these abnormal IgA1 molecules.  3. The resulting immune complexes deposit in the mesangium.  4. The complexes activate the alternative complement pathway and mesangial cells, leading to proliferation, ECM production, and injury. | A hereditary or acquired defect in glycosylation of IgA1. Genetic influence suggested by family occurrence and linkage to specific **MHC Class II** loci. | - | **Light Microscopy**: Lesions vary, from normal to mesangial widening and proliferation (mesangioproliferative GN), to focal proliferative GN, to overt crescentic GN. **Immunofluorescence**: This is diagnostic. Shows **mesangial deposition of IgA**, often with C3 and properdin. **Electron Microscopy**: Confirms electron-dense deposits predominantly in the mesangium. | Most common presentation is recurrent gross hematuria, often following an infection of the respiratory or GI tract. Many have only microscopic hematuria. Mild proteinuria is usually present; nephrotic syndrome can develop. Course is highly variable. | The diagnosis is made by detection of glomerular IgA deposition on biopsy. | Considered a renal-limited form of Henoch-Schönlein purpura. | Slow progression to chronic renal failure occurs in 15-40% of cases over 20 years. Can develop RPGN. Recurrence in transplanted kidneys is frequent. | - |
| **Acute tubular injury/necrosis (ATI/ATN)** A clinicopathologic entity characterized by acute renal failure and morphologic evidence of tubular injury/necrosis. The most common cause of acute kidney injury. | • **Ischemic ATI**: Caused by hypoperfusion of the kidneys due to shock, hypotension, severe trauma, etc.  • **Nephrotoxic ATI**: Caused by direct toxic injury from drugs (gentamicin), radiocontrast agents, heavy metals (mercury), organic solvents, or endogenous agents (myoglobin, hemoglobin). | Major surgery. Severe trauma. Sepsis. Dehydration. Exposure to nephrotoxins. Hemolytic crises. Rhabdomyolysis. | **Pathogenesis involves two key events:**  1. **Tubular injury**: Ischemia or toxins cause epithelial cell injury (loss of polarity, detachment from basement membrane, necrosis). Detached cells form casts, causing obstruction and increased intratubular pressure, which decreases GFR.  2. **Persistent disturbances in blood flow**: Intrarenal vasoconstriction (mediated by renin-angiotensin system, endothelin) reduces glomerular blood flow and GFR.  **Clinical Stages**: 1. **Initiation Phase** (36h): Inciting event dominates. Slight decline in urine output. 2. **Maintenance Phase**: Sustained oliguria, uremia, hyperkalemia. 3. **Recovery Phase**: Increase in urine volume (polyuria), loss of electrolytes, gradual return of function. | - | - | Characterized by injury and necrosis of tubular epithelial cells, with large skip areas in between.  • **Ischemic ATI**: Patchy necrosis, particularly affecting the straight portion of the proximal tubule and the ascending thick limb. Rupture of basement membranes (tubulorrhexis).  • **Toxic ATI**: Extensive necrosis along the proximal convoluted tubules. • Both types show occlusion of distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts by hyaline, granular, or pigmented **casts** (containing Tamm-Horsfall protein and hemoglobin/myoglobin).  • Interstitial edema is present.  • Regeneration is seen as flattened epithelial cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and mitotic figures. | Acute kidney injury, manifesting as oliguria (urine output <400 mL/day) or anuria. Rising BUN and creatinine. Signs of uremia, salt and water overload, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis. | Muddy brown granular casts in urine sediment. Rising BUN and creatinine. | • Ischemic type  • Nephrotoxic type | Increased vulnerability to infection during recovery phase. If injury is severe (e.g., in sepsis or multiorgan failure), mortality is high. | Supportive care, including dialysis, to manage fluid and electrolyte balance until tubular regeneration and recovery of renal function occurs. Prognosis is good if the underlying cause is resolved and patient survives the acute phase. |
| **Acute Pyelonephritis** A suppurative inflammation of the kidney affecting the tubules, interstitium, and renal pelvis, caused by bacterial infection. | Bacterial infection. More than 85% are caused by gram-negative bacilli from the intestinal tract. **Escherichia coli** is by far the most common. Others include Proteus, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter. Can also be caused by staphylococci or fungi, especially in immunocompromised patients. Polyomavirus can cause pyelonephritis in transplant recipients. | Urinary tract obstruction. Instrumentation (catheterization). **Vesicoureteral reflux**. Pregnancy. Female gender. Preexisting renal lesions. Diabetes. Immunosuppression. | There are two routes of infection: 1. **Ascending Infection (most common)**: Colonization of distal urethra by bacteria -> movement into bladder (facilitated by instrumentation or short female urethra) -> multiplication in bladder (especially with stasis) -> ascent to kidney via **vesicoureteral reflux** -> entry into renal parenchyma via **intrarenal reflux** (most common at poles). 2. **Hematogenous Infection**: Seeding of kidneys from bacteria in the bloodstream. | - | Patchy interstitial inflammation. May have discrete, yellowish, raised abscesses on the cortical surface. Can involve one or both kidneys. | The hallmarks are: • **Patchy interstitial suppurative inflammation**. • **Intratubular aggregates of neutrophils** (forming neutrophil casts or "pus casts"). • **Neutrophilic tubulitis** (neutrophils infiltrating tubular epithelium). • Tubular necrosis.  Glomeruli are characteristically resistant to the infection. Healing leads to a pyelonephritic scar. | Sudden onset of pain at the costovertebral angle. Systemic signs of infection like fever and malaise. Often associated with bladder irritation symptoms (dysuria, frequency, urgency). | Pyuria (many leukocytes in urine). Presence of **leukocyte casts (pus casts)** is diagnostic of renal involvement. Positive urine culture. | - | • **Papillary necrosis** (mainly in diabetics, sickle cell disease, obstruction) • **Pyonephrosis** (pus fills renal pelvis, seen in complete obstruction) • **Perinephric abscess** | Appropriate antibiotic therapy. |
| **Chronic Pyelonephritis and Reflux Nephropathy** A disorder where chronic tubulointerstitial inflammation and scarring involve the renal calyces and pelvis. It's an important cause of kidney destruction in children. | Caused by repeated bouts of acute inflammation and scarring. The two major forms are: • **Chronic obstructive pyelonephritis**: Obstruction predisposes to recurrent infections. • **Chronic reflux-associated pyelonephritis (Reflux Nephropathy)**: Superimposition of urinary infection on congenital vesicoureteral and intrarenal reflux. This is the more common form. | Vesicoureteral reflux. Urinary tract obstruction. | Recurrent episodes of acute pyelonephritis, driven by obstruction or reflux, lead to multiple episodes of tubulointerstitial injury. The healing of these inflammatory foci results in irregular scarring and progressive renal damage. | - | Kidneys are irregularly scarred, often asymmetrically. The hallmarks are **coarse, discrete, corticomedullary scars overlying dilated, blunted, or deformed calyces**, and flattening of the papillae. Scars are most common in the upper and lower poles, consistent with the frequency of reflux. | Microscopic changes involve tubules and interstitium: • Tubular atrophy in some areas, hypertrophy or dilation in others. • Dilated tubules filled with eosinophilic casts resembling thyroid colloid (**thyroidization**). • Chronic interstitial inflammation (lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages) and fibrosis. • Glomeruli may appear normal or show secondary changes (periglomerular fibrosis, FSGS). • **Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis** is a rare form with foamy macrophages. | Gradual onset of renal insufficiency and hypertension. May present with recurrent acute pyelonephritis (back pain, fever, pyuria). Loss of tubular concentrating ability gives rise to polyuria and nocturia. Proteinuria is usually mild, but can become significant if secondary FSGS develops. | Radiographic studies show asymmetrically contracted kidneys with characteristic coarse scars and calyceal blunting/deformity. | • Chronic obstructive pyelonephritis • Chronic reflux-associated pyelonephritis (Reflux nephropathy) | Hypertension. Secondary Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) with heavy proteinuria is a poor prognostic sign, increasing the likelihood of progression to ESRD. | Management of underlying condition (e.g., surgical correction of reflux or obstruction). |
| **Acute Drug-Induced Interstitial Nephritis** An inflammatory injury of the tubules and interstitium that occurs as a hypersensitivity reaction to a drug. A common cause of acute kidney injury. | Hypersensitivity reaction to a multitude of drugs. Common culprits include synthetic penicillins (methicillin), other antibiotics (rifampin), diuretics (thiazides), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). | Exposure to an offending drug. | It is an idiosyncratic immune reaction, not dose-related. The most likely sequence is that drugs function as **haptens**, binding to components of tubular cells. These modified self-antigens become immunogenic. The injury is then caused by either an IgE-mediated (Type I) or T cell-mediated (Type IV) hypersensitivity reaction directed against the tubules. | - | - | The interstitium shows pronounced edema and infiltration by mononuclear cells (lymphocytes, macrophages). A key feature is the presence of **eosinophils** and neutrophils, often in clusters. Plasma cells and mast cells may also be present. **Tubulitis** (infiltration of tubules by lymphocytes) is common. Glomeruli are typically normal. | Begins 2 to 40 days after drug exposure. Classic triad of **fever**, **eosinophilia**, and **rash** is present in a minority of patients. Renal abnormalities include hematuria, mild proteinuria, and leukocyturia (often including eosinophils). A rising serum creatinine or acute kidney injury develops in about 50% of cases. | Eosinophilia (serum), eosinophiluria (urine leukocytes). | - | Can cause irreversible damage if the offending drug is not withdrawn. Papillary necrosis can occur. NSAIDs can cause a curious association of acute interstitial nephritis with minimal change disease and nephrotic syndrome. | Withdrawal of the offending drug is critical and usually leads to recovery, though it may take several months. |
| **Typical hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)** The best-characterized form of HUS, a thrombotic microangiopathy most frequently associated with consumption of food contaminated by bacteria producing Shiga-like toxins. | Intestinal infection with strains of **E. coli** that produce Shiga-like toxins (e.g., serotype **O157:H7**). Less commonly, infections by Shigella dysenteriae. | Consumption of contaminated ground meat (hamburgers), raw milk, or contaminated water. Children and older adults are at highest risk. | The primary trigger is **endothelial injury** caused by Shiga-like toxin. The toxin "activates" endothelial cells, leading to increased expression of adhesion molecules, vasoconstriction, and apoptosis. This leads to platelet activation and formation of thrombi in the microvasculature, causing mechanical damage to red cells and tissue ischemia. | - | Kidney may show patchy or diffuse cortical necrosis and subcapsular petechiae. | Glomerular capillaries are distended and occluded by thrombi. There is damage to the mesangial cells (mesangiolysis). Interlobular arteries and arterioles also show occlusive thrombi. Fibrin stains show thrombi in glomerular capillaries. | Follows a prodrome of diarrheal illness. Then sudden onset of bleeding (hematemesis, melena), severe oliguria, and hematuria. Associated with the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. Hypertension is present in about half of patients. | Schistocytes on blood smear. Low platelet count. High BUN/creatinine. | Synonyms: epidemic, classic, diarrhea-positive HUS. | Neurologic changes can be prominent. Even with recovery, patients may have long-term chronic kidney disease. | Supportive management, including dialysis for renal failure. |
| **Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS)** A form of HUS not associated with Shiga-like toxins, caused by excessive activation of the complement system. | Majority of cases are associated with inherited mutations of or autoantibodies against complement-regulatory proteins. Can also be triggered by various causes of endothelial injury (antiphospholipid syndrome, drugs, radiation, pregnancy complications). | Family history of the disease. Pregnancy (postpartum renal failure). Scleroderma, malignant hypertension. Certain drugs (cyclosporine, mitomycin). | The key pathogenetic abnormality is the **excessive, inappropriate activation of the alternative complement pathway**. This is due to a deficiency in complement-regulatory proteins, which normally protect cells from damage by uncontrolled complement activation. This leads to endothelial injury, platelet activation, and thrombosis. | Caused by inherited mutations in genes that regulate the complement system, most commonly: • **Factor H** • **Factor I** • **CD46 (membrane cofactor protein)** Also caused by acquired autoantibodies against complement regulatory proteins (e.g., anti-Factor H antibodies). | Similar to typical HUS. Chronic cases show scarring. | Morphology is indistinguishable from other thrombotic microangiopathies. Chronic disease is common and features include thickened capillary walls ("double contours"), and "onion-skinning" of arteries and arterioles. | Presents similar to typical HUS but without a preceding diarrheal illness. Often has a more severe course. | Schistocytes, low platelets. Genetic testing for complement mutations. Assays for complement factors and autoantibodies. | Synonyms: non-epidemic, diarrhea-negative HUS; complement-mediated TMA. | Often follows a chronic course with poor prognosis, frequently progressing to end-stage renal disease. | Treatment with therapies that block complement activation (e.g., Eculizumab) has dramatically improved outcomes. |
| **Autosomal Dominant (Adult) Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD)** A common hereditary disorder characterized by multiple expanding cysts of both kidneys that ultimately destroy the renal parenchyma and cause renal failure. | Genetic disorder with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. | Family history of ADPKD. Progression is accelerated in blacks (especially with sickle cell trait), males, and in the presence of hypertension. | This is a "**ciliopathy**". Follows a "**two-hit**" model: individuals inherit one mutated allele and acquire a second somatic mutation in the other allele in a tubular cell. The genes encode polycystin-1 and -2, proteins localized to the primary cilium of tubular cells. The cilium functions as a mechanosensor. Defective polycystin function disrupts this sensing, alters intracellular Ca2+ flux and signaling, leading to abnormal cell proliferation, fluid secretion, and cell-matrix interactions, all of which culminate in cyst formation and enlargement. | Mutations in one of two genes: • **PKD1** on chromosome 16p13.3 (encodes **polycystin-1**): Accounts for ~85% of cases. Leads to more severe disease with earlier onset of renal failure. • **PKD2** on chromosome 4q21 (encodes **polycystin-2**): Accounts for ~15% of cases. Milder disease. | Kidneys are bilaterally enlarged and may achieve enormous sizes (up to 4 kg each). The external surface appears to be a mass of cysts (up to 3-4 cm) with no intervening parenchyma visible. Cysts may be filled with clear, turbid, or hemorrhagic fluid. | Microscopic examination reveals functioning nephrons dispersed between cysts of varying sizes. The cysts arise from tubules throughout the nephron and are lined by variable epithelia, sometimes with papillary formations. | Often asymptomatic until renal insufficiency develops in the 4th or 5th decade of life. Symptoms include flank pain, a dragging sensation, and hematuria (from cyst hemorrhage). Presents with insidious onset of hypertension, polyuria, and proteinuria. Palpable enlarged kidneys. | Diagnosis is made by radiologic imaging (ultrasound, CT, MRI). Genetic testing. | - | **Extrarenal congenital anomalies** are common: • Polycystic liver disease (~40%) • Cysts in spleen, pancreas, lungs • Intracranial **berry aneurysms** in the circle of Willis (rupture is a cause of death in 4-10%) • Mitral valve prolapse (20-25%) | Supportive care, control of hypertension. Vasopressin receptor antagonists (e.g., tolvaptan) may slow cyst growth and progression. Ultimately requires dialysis or transplantation for ESRD. |
| **Autosomal Recessive (Childhood) Polycystic Kidney Disease (ARPKD)** A genetically distinct polycystic kidney disease of childhood, characterized by cystic dilation of collecting ducts and associated with hepatic fibrosis. | Genetic disorder with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. | Family history of ARPKD (sibling with disease). | Like ADPKD, this is a "**ciliopathy**". The gene product, fibrocystin, is localized to the primary cilium of tubular cells and is thought to be a cell surface receptor involved in collecting duct and biliary differentiation. Its loss leads to the characteristic renal and hepatic abnormalities. | Caused by mutations in the **PKHD1** gene on chromosome 6p21-p23, which encodes **fibrocystin**. | Kidneys are enlarged and have a smooth external appearance. Cut section reveals numerous small cysts in the cortex and medulla, giving a **spongelike appearance**. Dilated elongated channels are present at right angles to the cortical surface. | Microscopically, there is cylindrical or saccular dilation of all collecting tubules. Cysts have a uniform lining of cuboidal cells. The liver invariably has cysts, portal fibrosis, and proliferation of portal bile ducts. | Serious manifestations are usually present at birth, and infants might succumb rapidly to renal failure. Patients who survive infancy develop hepatic disease (congenital hepatic fibrosis), which often becomes the predominant clinical concern, leading to portal hypertension and splenomegaly. | - | Subcategories (perinatal, neonatal, infantile, juvenile) are defined by time of presentation and severity of associated hepatic lesions. | **Congenital hepatic fibrosis** is a constant feature and major cause of morbidity/mortality in older children. Portal hypertension. Splenomegaly. | - |
| **Renal calculi (Urolithiasis, Nephrolithiasis, Stones)** Formation of stones anywhere in the urinary tract, but most arise in the kidney. | The most important determinant is an increased urinary concentration of stone constituents that exceeds their solubility (**supersaturation**). A deficiency of inhibitors of crystal formation (citrate, pyrophosphate, osteopontin) can also contribute. | Male gender. Peak age 20-30 years. Family history. Inborn errors of metabolism (cystinuria, primary hyperoxaluria). Low urine volume. Hypercalcemic states (hyperparathyroidism). Gout. Recurrent urinary tract infections (for struvite stones). Low urinary pH (for uric acid and cystine stones). | Stone formation requires supersaturation of urine with a constituent. This allows for nucleation (crystal formation), which can be enhanced by specific mechanisms (e.g., nucleation of calcium oxalate by uric acid crystals). Once a nidus is formed, it can grow through crystal aggregation and accretion of new material. | Cystine stones are caused by genetic defects in the renal reabsorption of amino acids, including cystine (cystinuria). | Stones are unilateral in ~80% of patients. Favored sites are renal calyces and pelvis. They vary in size and shape. Large branching stones that create a cast of the pelvic and calyceal system are called **staghorn calculi** and are typical of struvite stones. | All calculi contain an organic mucoprotein matrix. Crystal morphology on microscopic exam of urine can give clues to the stone type. | May be asymptomatic. Larger stones can cause hematuria. The classic symptom is **renal colic** - intense, spasmodic flank pain that radiates to the groin, caused by a stone passing into and obstructing the ureter. | Imaging (CT scan is gold standard). Urinalysis may show hematuria and crystals. Stone analysis after passage or removal. | **Four main types**: • **Calcium Oxalate/Phosphate (~70%)**: Radiopaque.  • **Magnesium Ammonium Phosphate (Struvite) (~15%)**: AKA triple stones or infection stones. Radiopaque.  • **Uric Acid (~5-10%)**: Radiolucent. • **Cystine (~1-2%)**: Radiopaque. | Urinary tract obstruction and hydronephrosis. Predisposition to superimposed bacterial infection. Significant renal damage. | Pain management. High fluid intake. Medical therapy to alter urine pH or composition. Surgical removal or lithotripsy for larger or obstructive stones. |
| **Renal cell carcinoma (RCC)** A malignant epithelial neoplasm arising from the renal tubules. Represents 85% of renal cancers in adults. | Most cases are sporadic. There are also several inherited cancer syndromes that increase risk. | **Tobacco** (cigarette, pipe, cigar smoking) is the most significant risk factor. Obesity. Hypertension. Unopposed estrogen therapy. Exposure to asbestos, petroleum products. ESRD and acquired cystic disease. Tuberous sclerosis. Familial cancer syndromes. | Pathogenesis depends on the subtype. For clear cell carcinoma, the key event is loss of the VHL tumor suppressor gene. The VHL protein is part of a ubiquitin ligase complex that targets **hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1)** for degradation. When VHL is inactive, HIF-1 levels remain high even in normoxia, driving the expression of genes that promote angiogenesis (e.g., **VEGF**) and cell growth, leading to tumorigenesis. For papillary carcinoma, activating mutations of the MET proto-oncogene are key. | • **Clear Cell Carcinoma**: Loss of chromosome 3p, with inactivation of the **VHL** tumor suppressor gene. Occurs in sporadic cases and is the defining mutation in **von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome**. • **Papillary Carcinoma**: Trisomy 7, 17. Familial forms are caused by activating mutations in the **MET** proto-oncogene. • **Hereditary leiomyomatosis and RCC syndrome**: Caused by mutations of the **FH** gene (fumarate hydratase). • **Xp11 translocation carcinoma**: Defined by translocations of the **TFE3** gene. | Typically spherical masses, often in the poles of the kidney. Clear cell carcinomas are bright yellow-gray-white, with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage. They have a tendency to invade the **renal vein**, where they can grow as a solid column up the IVC. | Histology varies by type: • **Clear Cell Carcinoma**: Cells with rounded/polygonal shape and abundant clear or granular cytoplasm (contains glycogen and lipids). Arranged in solid, trabecular, or tubular patterns with a delicate branching vasculature. • **Papillary Carcinoma**: Cuboidal or low columnar cells arranged in papillary formations. Interstitial foam cells are common in papillary cores. • **Chromophobe Carcinoma**: Pale eosinophilic cells with prominent cell membranes and a perinuclear halo. | Classic triad of **costovertebral pain, palpable mass, and hematuria** is seen in only 10% of cases. Hematuria is the most reliable clue but is often intermittent and microscopic. Many tumors are discovered incidentally on imaging. They are great mimics, presenting with a diversity of systemic symptoms (fever, malaise, weight loss) and **paraneoplastic syndromes**. | - | • **Clear cell carcinoma (70-80%)** • **Papillary carcinoma (10-15%)** • **Chromophobe carcinoma (5%)** • Xp11 translocation carcinoma • Collecting duct (Bellini duct) carcinoma | Tendency to metastasize widely, often before local symptoms. Common sites are lungs and bones. A wide range of **paraneoplastic syndromes**: polycythemia (from erythropoietin), hypercalcemia (from PTHrP), hypertension (from renin), Cushing syndrome (from ACTH). | Radical or partial (nephron-sparing) nephrectomy. Adjuvant therapy for metastatic disease with drugs that inhibit VEGF and various tyrosine kinases (targeted therapy). |
