# [[Lower Limb]] > Calcaneum Fracture

# Calcaneum Fracture

[[Calcaneus]] (Os Calcis) is the most commonly fractured tarsal bone. It is often described as a "soft bone in a hard shell" doing the hard job of weight transmission.

### Synonyms
*   **Lover's Fracture**: Named because a suitor jumping from a balcony to escape a jealous spouse might sustain this injury.
*   **Don Juan Fracture**.

### Mechanism of Injury
The primary mechanism is **Axial Loading** (Vertical Compression).
*   **Fall from height:** Landing directly on the heels.
*   **RTA:** Floorboard intrusion in car accidents.
*   The talus acts as a wedge/hammer, driving down into the calcaneus and splitting it.

### Associated Injuries
Because the mechanism involves significant axial force, shock waves travel up the skeleton. Always screen for associated injuries ("Jumper's Triad"):
1.  **Spine:** Compression fracture of the [[Thoracolumbar Spine]] (usually D12-L1) occurs in ~10% of cases.
2.  **Pelvis/Hip:** Fractures of the acetabulum or femoral neck.
3.  **Other Limb:** Fracture of the plateau or calcaneus of the opposite side.

**Clinical Implication:** In any patient with a bilateral calcaneal fracture or a fall from height, a spinal X-ray is mandatory even if the patient has no back pain initially due to distracting severe heel pain.

### Clinical Features
*   **Pain:** Severe heel pain, inability to bear weight.
*   **Swelling:** Rapid and massive swelling is characteristic.
*   **Deformity:**
    *   **Broadening of the heel:** Due to lateral blowout of the wall.
    *   **Flattening of the longitudinal arch:** Loss of heel height.
*   **Ecchymosis:** Often appears on the sole of the foot extending to the ankle.
*   **Blistering:** Fracture blisters may appear within 24–48 hours due to massive soft tissue edema.

### Classification
Fractures are broadly classified into **Extra-articular** (25–30%) and **Intra-articular** (70–75%).

#### 1. Essex-Lopresti Classification (Based on X-ray)
Distinguishes types of intra-articular fractures based on the secondary fracture line:
*   **Tongue Type:** The secondary fracture line runs horizontally posterior to the tuberosity. A "tongue" of bone (including the articular surface) is attached to the Achilles tendon and displaced superiorly.
*   **Joint Depression Type:** The secondary fracture line runs posterior to the joint, creating a separate articular fragment that is impacted/depressed into the body of the calcaneus.

#### 2. Sanders Classification (Based on CT Scan)
Based on the number of articular fragments seen on the coronal CT view at the widest point of the posterior facet.
*   **Type I:** Undisplaced (regardless of number of fracture lines).
*   **Type II:** Two articular fragments (one fracture line).
*   **Type III:** Three articular fragments (two fracture lines).
*   **Type IV:** Comminuted (more than three fragments).

### Radiological Assessment

#### 1. Plain X-rays
*   **Lateral View:** Standard view. Used to measure angles.
*   **Axial View (Harris View):** Demonstrates widening of the heel and varus/valgus deformity.
*   **Oblique Views:** To visualize the calcaneocuboid joint.

#### 2. Important Angles (Lateral View)

| Angle | Normal Value | Pathological Change in Fracture | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Bohler's Angle]]** (Tuber-Joint Angle) | **20° – 40°** | **Decreases** (Can become flat 0° or negative) | Indicates collapse of the posterior facet. Prognostic for recovery. |
| **[[Gissane's Angle]]** (Crucial Angle) | **95° – 105°** | **Increases** / Distorted | Indicates impaction of the talus into the calcaneus. |

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Lateral X-ray drawing of Calcaneus. Line 1: Highest point of anterior process to highest point of posterior facet. Line 2: Highest point of posterior facet to superior edge of tuberosity. The angle between them is Bohler's Angle.

#### 3. CT Scan
*   **Gold Standard** for intra-articular fractures.
*   Essential for surgical planning (Sanders classification).

### Treatment

#### 1. Conservative Management
**Indications:**
*   Undisplaced fractures (Sanders Type I).
*   Extra-articular fractures with minimal deformity.
*   Patients with severe peripheral vascular disease or diabetes (high wound complication risk).
*   "Wrinkle sign" absent (swelling too severe for surgery).

**Protocol:**
*   **R.I.C.E:** Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation.
*   **Strict Limb Elevation:** Crucial to reduce edema and prevent blisters.
*   **Immobilization:** Below-knee cast or splint.
*   **Mobilization:** Non-weight bearing for 6–12 weeks. Early range of motion exercises for the subtalar joint if stable.

#### 2. Surgical Management
**Indications:**
*   Displaced intra-articular fractures (Sanders Type II and III).
*   Significant widening of the heel.
*   Flattening of Bohler’s angle (loss of height).
*   Open fractures.

**Methods:**
*   **Closed Reduction & Percutaneous Fixation (Essex-Lopresti Maneuver):**
    *   A heavy Steinmann pin is inserted into the tongue fragment.
    *   Used as a "joystick" to reduce the fracture and restore height.
    *   Fixed with K-wires or screws.
*   **Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF):**
    *   Approach: Extensile lateral approach (L-shaped incision).
    *   Implant: **Locking Plate** (Calcaneal plate) and screws.
    *   Goal: Anatomic restoration of the posterior facet and Bohler’s angle.

**Clinical Implication:** Surgery is usually delayed for 7–14 days until the "Wrinkle Sign" appears (skin wrinkles reappear when dorsiflexed), indicating swelling has subsided enough to minimize wound dehiscence risk.

### Complications

#### Early
1.  **[[Compartment Syndrome]] of the Foot:**
    *   The calcaneus bleeds profusely into the central compartment.
    *   Features: Intense pain, tense swelling, pain on passive toe extension.
    *   Treatment: Emergency fasciotomy (medial approach).
2.  **Wound Dehiscence/Infection:** Common due to thin soft tissue cover over the lateral wall.
3.  **Fracture Blisters.**

#### Late
1.  **Subtalar Arthritis:** Most common long-term complication causing chronic pain on inversion/eversion (walking on uneven ground). Treatment: Subtalar arthrodesis (fusion).
2.  **Malunion (Heel Widening):**
    *   Broadening of the heel causes impingement of the peroneal tendons against the lateral malleolus ([[Peroneal Tendonitis]] or Impingement).
    *   Difficulty wearing standard shoes.
3.  **Heel Pad Pain:** Due to crushing of the fibro-fatty loculi of the heel pad.
4.  **Exostosis:** Bony prominence causing pressure sores.
