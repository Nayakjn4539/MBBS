# [[Sexual Jurisprudence]] > Examination of Accused in Rape

### Examination of Accused in Rape

The medical examination of a person accused of [[rape]] is a critical component of the investigative process. It aims to connect the accused to the crime scene or the victim through physical evidence (Locard's Principle of Exchange) and to assess his potency.

### Legal Provisions
*   **Section 53-A CrPC:** Mandates the medical examination of a person accused of rape.
*   **Requisition:** Must be made by a police officer not below the rank of **Sub-Inspector**.
*   **Consent:** While informed consent should be requested, the accused **cannot refuse** this examination. If resistance is offered, **reasonable force** may be used to conduct the examination and collect samples.
*   **Examiner:** Must be a Registered Medical Practitioner (RMP), preferably employed in a government hospital.

### I. Preliminary Data
1.  **Identification:** The accused must be identified by the accompanying police constable (PC). Record the name and buckle number of the PC.
2.  **Bio-data:** Name, age, occupation, address, and **two identification marks**.
3.  **Time:** Exact date and time of arrival and examination (crucial for evidence preservation).
4.  **Consent:** Record that the accused was informed about the examination. If he refuses, note the refusal and proceed under the authority of Sec 53-A CrPC.

### II. History Taking
A general medical history is taken to exclude illnesses affecting sexual function.
*   **Do not extract a confession:** The doctor should not attempt to obtain a history of the specific criminal incident to avoid self-incrimination.
*   **Accused's Version:** Briefly record the history *as narrated by the accused* regarding his physical condition or any injuries he claims to have sustained.
*   **Recent Sexual Activity:** Ask about consensual intercourse in the last 24–48 hours (to interpret finding of smegma or vaginal cells).
*   **Toilet:** Ask when he last bathed, urinated, or defecated.

### III. General Physical Examination
1.  **General State:** Built, nourishment, and development of secondary sexual characteristics.
2.  **Mental State:** Note if he is calm, anxious, aggressive, or under the influence of [[Alcohol]] or drugs.
3.  **Examination of Clothes:**
    *   Examine for **tears** or missing buttons (signs of struggle).
    *   Look for stains: **Blood**, **semen**, mud, grass, or fecal matter.
    *   Look for foreign materials: Scalp hair (from victim), fibers.
4.  **Injuries on the Body:**
    *   Systematically examine the whole body for recent injuries indicative of a struggle.
    *   **Specific sites:** Face, neck, hands, chest, and inner thighs.
    *   **Types of injuries:** [[Abrasions]] (linear scratches), [[Contusion]] (bruises), or **bite marks**.
    *   **Nails:** Check for broken nails or blood/skin tags under the nails.

### IV. Local Genital Examination
1.  **Development:** Note the development of the penis and scrotum. Assess for any congenital malformations (e.g., severe hypospadias) that might cause mechanical impotence.
2.  **Smegma:**
    *   Check for the presence of **smegma** (cheesy white secretion) accumulation around the corona glandis (in uncircumcised males).
    *   *Significance:* It usually takes **24 hours** to accumulate. Its presence suggests no recent vigorous intercourse or thorough washing. Its absence is not conclusive but consistent with recent cleaning or friction.
3.  **Injuries to Genitals:**
    *   Look for tears or bruising of the **frenulum** (common in forceful intercourse).
    *   Abrasions or redness on the glans penis or prepuce.
    *   Look for bite marks on the genitals.
4.  **Infections:** Examine for signs of sexually transmitted diseases (chancre, urethral discharge).
5.  **Trace Evidence on Penis:**
    *   Look for blood, vaginal secretions, or fecal matter (in sodomy cases) on the penile shaft/coronal sulcus.
    *   **Lugol's Iodine Test:** A filter paper moist with saline is rubbed on the glans/shaft and exposed to Lugol's iodine vapors. A **brown color** indicates the presence of glycogen-rich cells (vaginal epithelial cells).

### V. Collection of Samples (The "Rape Kit" for Accused)
All samples must be sealed, labeled, and signed (chain of custody) before handing over to the police.

| Sample | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Blood** (5ml with EDTA) | [[DNA Fingerprinting]], Blood grouping. |
| **Blood** (5ml with Fluoride) | Detection of Alcohol/Drugs. |
| **Urine** | Drug screening / Alcohol. |
| **Penile Swabs** | Taken from glans, shaft, and coronal sulcus to detect victim's DNA (vaginal cells). |
| **Pubic Hair** | 1. **Combing:** To retrieve loose foreign hair (victim's).<br>2. **Sample:** Pluck/cut 10-20 hairs for comparison. |
| **Nail Scrapings/Clippings** | To detect victim's tissue/blood (from scratching) or fibers. |
| **Clothing** | Underwear and trousers worn during the crime (for semen/blood/mud). |
| **Saliva/Buccal Swab** | For DNA profiling (Reference sample) and secretor status. |

### VI. Potency Assessment
*   The doctor is often asked to certify if the accused is capable of performing sexual intercourse.
*   **Current Practice:** There is no specific clinical test to prove potency in a routine setting. Potency is presumed if the genital organs are normally developed and there is no history/evidence of debilitating disease or injury affecting sexual function.
*   **Opinion:** Usually stated as *"There is nothing in the physical examination to suggest that the accused is incapable of performing sexual intercourse."*

### Medico-Legal Opinion/Report
The final report must be prepared without delay (Sec 53A CrPC) and should include:
1.  Name and address of the accused.
2.  Age of the accused.
3.  Marks of injury (detailed description).
4.  Description of material taken from the person for DNA profiling.
5.  **Conclusion:** Precise reasons for each conclusion arrived at.
    *   *Example:* "Injuries present on the body are consistent with signs of struggle. No physical disability found to suggest impotence."

### Mnemonic
**"SCALP"** for examination of the accused:
*   **S** - **S**megma (Check presence/absence) / **S**tains
*   **C** - **C**lothes (Tears, buttons, mud) / **C**apacity (Potency)
*   **A** - **A**ge & **A**lcohol status
*   **L** - **L**ocal injuries (Frenulum tear, scratches)
*   **P** - **P**ubic hair combings & **P**enile swabs
