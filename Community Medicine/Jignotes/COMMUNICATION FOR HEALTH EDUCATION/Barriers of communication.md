# [[COMMUNICATION FOR HEALTH EDUCATION]] > Barriers of communication

# Barriers of Communication

[[Health education]] often fails not because of the intent, but because of specific obstacles that distort or block the message between the sender (educator) and the receiver (community). These obstacles are known as barriers of communication.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a standard communication loop (Sender -> Message -> Channel -> Receiver) and place a jagged wall labeled 'Barriers' blocking the path between Sender and Receiver.

### 1. Physiological Barriers
These are related to the biological functioning of the sender or receiver.
*   **Difficulties in hearing or vision:** If the audience cannot hear the speaker or see the visual aids clearly, communication fails.
*   **Difficulties in expression:** Speech defects or inability to articulate thoughts by the health educator,,.

### 2. Psychological Barriers
These are emotional or cognitive factors that hinder the understanding of the message.
*   **Emotional disturbances:** [[Neurosis]], fear, anxiety, or worry can block a person's ability to listen or process information.
*   **Intelligence Levels:** If the teaching is not pitched to the mental capacity of the learner, it will be ignored.
*   **Language/Comprehension:** Use of difficult vocabulary, technical jargon, or a language not fluent to the receiver constitutes a major barrier,.
*   **Perception:** Different people perceive the same phenomenon differently based on their background. If the sender's and receiver's perceptions are miles apart, understanding is impossible.

### 3. Environmental (Physical) Barriers
These are external factors in the setting where communication takes place.
*   **[[Noise]]:** The most common environmental barrier. It distracts attention.
*   **Invisibility:** If the audience cannot see the speaker or the demonstration.
*   **Congestion/Overcrowding:** Physical discomfort leads to mental distraction.
*   **Temperature:** Extreme heat or cold in the venue,,.

### 4. Cultural Barriers
This is often the **most significant barrier** in community health practice. Even if services are available, social and cultural gaps can prevent utilization.
*   **Illiteracy:** Written media is useless for illiterate populations.
*   **Customs and Beliefs:** Traditional beliefs (e.g., food taboos during pregnancy) often conflict with modern medical advice.
*   **Religion:** Religious sanctions may oppose certain health interventions (e.g., contraception).
*   **Attitudes:** Resistance to change established habits.
*   **Cultural Gap:** The difference in social status and background between the urban-educated health worker and the rural population creates a "social distance" that hinders trust,,.

### 5. Technical Barriers
These arise from the logistics of the communication method itself.
*   **Inappropriate Media:** Using a method that doesn't fit the audience (e.g., a PowerPoint presentation in a village without electricity).
*   **Concealment of Information:** Deliberately hiding facts or side effects.
*   **Inadequate projection:** Visual aids that are too small or blurry.

### Mnemonic
To remember the 4 main types, think of **"P-P-E-C"**:

*   **P**sychological (Mind)
*   **E**nvironmental (Surroundings)
*   **C**ultural (Society)

**"P**eople **P**refer **E**asy **C**ommunication"

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Doctor-Patient Relationship:** A doctor using complex medical terms like "Myocardial Infarction" instead of "Heart Attack" creates a **Psychological/Language barrier**.
*   **Compliance:** A patient refusing **[[Iron Folic Acid]]** tablets because of a belief that it causes a "large baby" and difficult labor is exhibiting a **Cultural barrier**.
*   **Clinics:** A noisy, hot OPD waiting area creates an **Environmental barrier**, making patients irritable and less likely to listen to health instructions.
