# [[PRINCIPLES OF EPIDEMIOLOGY]] > In your district immunisation rate has fallen to 50%. How would you investigate to find out the reason? How do you concurrently try to increase the immunization rate?

### Part 1: Investigation of Low Immunization Coverage

To investigate why the [[immunization coverage]] has dropped to 50%, a systematic evaluation using epidemiological methods is required to identify the "at-risk" population and the bottlenecks in service delivery.

#### 1. Evaluation Survey: [[30 Cluster Sampling Method]]
This is the standard WHO-recommended technique to evaluate immunization coverage in India.
*   **Target:** Children aged 12–23 months.
*   **Sample Size:** A total of **210 children** are surveyed.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   **Selection:** 30 clusters (villages/wards) are selected randomly.
    *   **Survey:** From each cluster, 7 children are examined.
    *   **Data Point:** Verification is done using the [[immunization card]] or by checking for the [[BCG scar]] and interviewing the mother.
*   **Outcome:** This method provides an estimated coverage rate with a precision of $\pm$ 10%.

#### 2. Identifying the Barriers (The "Why")
Investigate the specific reasons for **Left-outs** (never vaccinated) and **Drop-outs** (started but not finished).
*   **Administrative/Logistical Failures:**
    *   Shortage of vaccine supply or [[auto-disable syringes]].
    *   Failure of the [[Cold Chain]] equipment (e.g., breakdown of [[Ice-lined Refrigerator]]) leading to vaccine spoilage.
    *   Lack of micro-planning or absence of health workers (ANM) at the sub-center.
*   **Social/Community Factors:**
    *   **Lack of Awareness:** Parents unaware of the session site or the benefits of vaccination.
    *   **Fear/Myths:** Fear of [[Adverse Events Following Immunization]] (AEFI), such as fever or pain, or myths regarding impotency,.
    *   **Migration:** Urban slums with migratory populations or nomadic sites often have high dropout rates.

### Part 2: Concurrent Measures to Increase Immunization Rate

To raise the coverage from 50% back to the target levels (aiming for >85% or universal coverage), a multi-pronged strategy must be implemented immediately.

#### 1. Strategic Planning and Logistics
*   **Micro-planning:** Update the beneficiary list using head-count surveys by [[ASHA]] and Anganwadi workers to track every pregnant woman and child.
*   **Strengthening the [[Cold Chain]]:** Ensure vaccines are stored at the correct temperature (+2°C to +8°C in ILR) and that [[Vaccine Vial Monitor]] (VVM) status is checked before administration,.
*   **Supply Chain:** Ensure adequate buffer stock (25%) of vaccines and diluents.

#### 2. Service Delivery Approaches
*   **Fixed Sessions:** Ensure regular immunization days (e.g., Wednesdays) at the [[Primary Health Centre]] and Sub-centers,.
*   **Outreach Sessions:** Organize sessions in villages/slums to bring services closer to the community, utilizing the **Village Health Nutrition Day (VHND)**.
*   **Catch-up Campaigns:** Implement special drives like [[Mission Indradhanush]] to cover children who have been left out or dropped out,.
    *   *Focus:* Unvaccinated and partially vaccinated children in high-risk areas (slums, brick kilns, construction sites).

#### 3. Social Mobilization and Tracking
*   **Tracking Systems:** Use the **Mother and Child Tracking System (MCTS)** or name-based tracking to identify dropouts.
*   **Community Involvement:** Utilize the **Mahila Swasthya Sangha** or local leaders to mobilize the community and remove resistance.
*   **Incentives:** Ensure **ASHA** workers receive their incentives for ensuring full immunization of children (Rs. 100 for full immunization).

#### 4. Health Education (IEC)
*   **Interpersonal Communication (IPC):** Health workers must counsel mothers on the benefits of vaccines, minor side effects (to reduce anxiety), and the next visit date.
*   **Countering Rumors:** Address specific myths (e.g., regarding infertility) immediately through community meetings.

### Clinical Relevance
**[[Herd Immunity]]:**
Increasing the immunization rate is crucial to establish Herd Immunity. When a high percentage of the population (e.g., >80-85% for Polio and Diphtheria) is vaccinated, it disrupts the chain of transmission, protecting even the unimmunized,.

### Mnemonic for Improving Coverage: **"VACCINE"**

*   **V**erify the data (30 Cluster Survey)
*   **A**wareness generation (IEC)
*   **C**old Chain maintenance
*   **C**atch-up campaigns ([[Mission Indradhanush]])
*   **I**nvolve community leaders
*   **N**ame-based tracking (MCTS)
*   **E**quipment and supply check
