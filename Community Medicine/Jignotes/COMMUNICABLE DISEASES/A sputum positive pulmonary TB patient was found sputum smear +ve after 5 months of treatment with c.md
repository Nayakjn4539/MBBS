# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > A sputum positive pulmonary TB patient was found sputum smear +ve after 5 months of treatment with category -1. What is your inference about the case? What is the next line management as per RNTCP?

### Inference About the Case

The inference for a sputum positive pulmonary TB patient who remains sputum smear positive after **5 months** of treatment with Category-1 is **[[Treatment Failure]]**.

*   **Definition:** A TB patient whose sputum smear or culture is positive at month 5 or later during treatment is declared a "Failure" case.
*   **Clinical Significance:** This patient is highly suspected to have **[[MDR-TB]]** (Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis). Failure of the first-line regimen (Category I) is a key criterion for identifying MDR-TB suspects.
*   **Microbiological Status:** The patient is still infectious and discharging bacilli, posing a transmission risk to the community.

### Next Line Management as per RNTCP (NTEP)

The management involves a shift from empirical re-treatment to evidence-based management driven by drug susceptibility testing.

#### 1. Identification and Registration
*   The patient is taken off the current Category I regimen immediately.
*   The case is re-registered as **"Treatment after Failure"**.
*   **Notification:** The case status is updated in the **[[NIKSHAY]]** portal.

#### 2. Diagnostic Workup (Crucial Step)
Before starting the re-treatment regimen, it is mandatory to determine if the patient has developed drug resistance.
*   **Sputum Examination:** Two sputum samples are collected.
*   **[[CBNAAT]] (GeneXpert) / TruNAAT:** This is the *investigation of choice* to rapidly detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis and **Rifampicin resistance**.
*   **Culture and DST:** Samples should be sent to a certified laboratory for Liquid Culture and Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST) to check for resistance to other first-line and second-line drugs.

#### 3. Treatment Regimen
The treatment depends on the DST results (Drug Susceptibility Testing):

**Scenario A: If Rifampicin Sensitive (Rare in failure cases but possible)**
*   The patient is treated as a "Previously Treated Case".
*   **Regimen:** Standard First Line Regimen (2HRZE + 4HRE). *Note: The older Category II (2HRZES + 1HRZE + 5HRE) involving Streptomycin is being phased out in favor of daily FDCs unless specifically indicated*.

**Scenario B: If Rifampicin Resistant (MDR-TB) [Most Likely Scenario]**
*   The patient is treated under **[[PMDT]]** (Programmatic Management of Drug-Resistant TB) guidelines.
*   **Regimen Choice:**
    *   **Shorter Oral Bedaquiline-containing MDR/RR-TB Regimen:** Preferred if the patient meets inclusion criteria (e.g., no fluoroquinolone resistance).
        *   *Duration:* 9–11 months.
        *   *Drugs:* Bedaquiline, Levofloxacin, Clofazimine, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol, High-dose Isoniazid, Ethionamide.
    *   **Longer Oral M/XDR-TB Regimen:** Used if the patient is not eligible for the shorter regimen (e.g., extensive disease, pregnancy, specific drug intolerance).
        *   *Duration:* 18–20 months.

### Comparison: Old vs. New Management

| Feature | Old RNTCP Guideline | Current NTEP Guideline |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Immediate Action** | Shift to Category II (Retreatment) | Send for **[[CBNAAT]]/DST** immediately |
| **Drug Susceptibility** | DST done only if Cat II failed | **Upfront DST** (Universal DST) is mandatory |
| **Regimen** | 2HRZES + 1HRZE + 5HRE (Add Streptomycin) | **MDR-TB Regimen** (if resistant) or Standard Protocol based on DST |
| **Assumption** | Assumed sensitive/relapse | Assumed **Drug Resistant** until proven otherwise |

### Mnemonics for Review

*   **Failure at Five:** Remember **F** for **F**ive months and **F** for **F**ailure. If they are positive at month 5, they have Failed.
*   **MDR suspects are "BAD"**:
    *   **B** - Bacilli +ve after 4th month (Cat II) or 5th month (Cat I)
    *   **A** - Active contacts of MDR-TB
    *   **D** - Defaulters returning / Diagnosis of Failure

### Clinical Relevance
Why 5 months?
The intensive phase is meant to kill the rapidly multiplying bacilli. If the sputum is still positive at 5 months (deep into the continuation phase), it implies the "persisters" are not dying or resistant mutants have overgrown the sensitive population. Continuing the same failing regimen will only amplify resistance (leading to XDR-TB) and increase mortality.
