# [[CONCEPT OF HEALTH & DISEASES]] > Human development Index (HDI).

### **Human Development Index (HDI)**

**Definition**
The [[Human Development Index (HDI)]] is a composite index measuring average achievement in three basic dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, knowledge, and a decent standard of living. It reflects achievements in the most basic human capabilities and is a more comprehensive measure of socio-economic development than per capita income alone.

### **Dimensions and Indicators**

The HDI combines three dimensions using specific indicators:

1.  **Longevity (Health):** Measured by [[Life Expectancy at Birth]].
2.  **Knowledge (Education):** Measured by:
    *   **Mean years of schooling** (for adults aged 25 years and older).
    *   **Expected years of schooling** (for children of school-entering age).
3.  **Standard of Living (Income):** Measured by [[Gross National Income (GNI) per capita]] in Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) US dollars,.

> *   **I** - **I**ncome (Standard of Living/GNI)
> *   **L** - **L**ongevity (Life Expectancy)

### **Calculation Methodology**

The HDI is the **geometric mean** of the normalized indices for each of the three dimensions.

**Step 1: Creating Dimension Indices**
Indices are calculated using minimum and maximum values (goalposts) to transform indicators into a value between 0 and 1.
**Formula:**
$$ \text{Dimension Index} = \frac{\text{Actual Value} - \text{Minimum Value}}{\text{Maximum Value} - \text{Minimum Value}} $$

**Goalposts for Calculation (2011/2019 series)**,:
| Dimension | Indicator | Minimum Value | Maximum Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Health** | Life Expectancy (years) | 20 | 85 |
| **Education** | Mean years of schooling | 0 | 15 |
| | Expected years of schooling | 0 | 18 |
| **Standard of Living** | Per capita Income (PPP $) | 100 | 75,000 |

**Step 2: Aggregating the Sub-indices**
$$ \text{HDI} = (\text{I}_{\text{Life}} \times \text{I}_{\text{Education}} \times \text{I}_{\text{Income}})^{1/3} $$
*(Note: Income index uses the natural logarithm of values)*,.

### **Interpretation of HDI Values**

*   **Range:** The HDI value ranges from **0 to +1**,.
*   **Significance:**
    *   **0** represents the worst possible performance.
    *   **+1** represents the best possible performance.
*   **Comparison:** It allows for comparison between countries. India currently falls into the **Medium Human Development** category.

**Classification of Countries**:
*   **Low HDI:** < 0.550
*   **Medium HDI:** 0.550 – 0.699
*   **High HDI:** 0.700 – 0.799
*   **Very High HDI:** ≥ 0.800

### **Comparison: HDI vs PQLI**

This is a favorite exam topic. Remember the differences clearly:

| Feature | **Human Development Index (HDI)** | **Physical Quality of Life Index (PQLI)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Components** | 1. Life Expectancy at **Birth**<br>2. **Income** (GNI per capita)<br>3. **Knowledge** (Schooling years) | 1. Life Expectancy at **Age 1**<br>2. **Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)**<br>3. **Literacy** Rate |
| **Range** | **0 to 1** | **0 to 100** |
| **Does it include Income?** | **Yes** (Money matters here) | **No** ("Money isn't everything") |
| **Calculation** | Geometric Mean | Average (Arithmetic Mean) |,,

---

### **Public Health Relevance**

*   **Holistic View:** HDI shifts the focus from simple economic growth (GDP) to human well-being. It recognizes that income is a *means* to development, not the *end*.
*   **Policy Tool:** It helps governments and international bodies (like UNDP) identify disparities and allocate resources to health and education sectors, not just industrial growth.
*   **Complementary Index:** The [[Human Poverty Index (HPI)]] is complementary to HDI; while HDI measures progress/development, HPI measures deprivation.
