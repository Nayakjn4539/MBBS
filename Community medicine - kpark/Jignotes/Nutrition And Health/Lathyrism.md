# [[Nutrition And Health]] > Lathyrism

### **Lathyrism**

**Lathyrism** is a paralyzing disease of humans and animals caused by the excessive consumption of the pulse ***Lathyrus sativus***. It is a classic example of a food-borne disease caused by naturally occurring toxins.

It is classified into two types:
1.  **[[Neurolathyrism]]:** Affects humans, impacting the nervous system.
2.  **[[Osteolathyrism]] (Odoratism):** Affects animals, causing pathological changes in bones and skeletal deformities.

### **Epidemiological Determinants**

#### **1. Agent Factors**
*   **The Pulse:** *Lathyrus sativus*, commonly known as **[[Khesari Dhal]]**, Teora dhal, or Lak dhal.
    *   It is a hardy crop, grows in drought conditions, and is very cheap.
    *   **Appearance:** Seeds have a characteristic **triangular shape** and grey color. When dehusked, it resembles red gram or Bengal gram and is often used to adulterate them.
*   **The Toxin:** The neurotoxin identified is **[[BOAA]]** (Beta-Oxalyl-Amino-Alanine).
    *   Characteristics: It is **water-soluble** (this property is used for detoxification).
    *   It interferes with the neurotransmitters in the spinal cord.

#### **2. Host Factors**
*   **Age/Sex:** Mainly affects **young men** between 15–45 years of age.
*   **Consumption Pattern:** The disease occurs if the diet contains **over 30%** of *Lathyrus* pulse consumed over a period of **2–6 months**.
*   **Blood-Brain Barrier:** There is a blood-brain barrier to the toxin; large amounts over a long period are required to overcome it.

#### **3. Environmental/Geographical Distribution**
*   Prevalent in Indian states like Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Orissa.
*   Associated with poverty, famine, and drought conditions where people are forced to eat this cheap pulse as a staple.

### **Clinical Features**

The disease is a **Crippling disease of the Nervous System** characterized by gradually developing **[[Spastic Paralysis]]** of the lower limbs (Upper Motor Neuron lesion).

The disease manifests in **5 progressive stages**:

| Stage | Clinical Picture | Clinical Relevance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Latent Stage** | Patient appears healthy but shows an ungainly gait when subjected to physical stress. | **Most Important:** If the pulse is withdrawn at this stage, **complete remission** is possible. |
| **2. No-stick Stage** | Patient walks with short, jerky steps. No aid (stick) is required. | Often seen in early cases. |
| **3. One-stick Stage** | Patient walks with a **crossed gait** (scissoring) and tends to walk on toes. Muscular stiffness requires one stick for balance. | Signs of established spasticity. |
| **4. Two-stick Stage** | Symptoms are severe. Excessive bending of knees and crossed legs. Needs **two crutches** for support. Gait is slow and clumsy. | Severe disability. |
| **5. Crawler Stage** | Erect posture becomes impossible. Knee joints cannot support weight. | Patient is reduced to crawling on hands. Atrophy of thigh/leg muscles occurs. |

### **Prevention and Control**

There is no cure once permanent damage occurs, but the following interventions are used:

**1. Vitamin C Prophylaxis**
*   Daily administration of **500–1000 mg of Ascorbic Acid** (Vitamin C).
*   It can prevent damage if given with the lathyrogenic diet.

**2. Banning the Crop**
*   The Prevention of Food Adulteration Act (PFA) has banned the sale of *Lathyrus* in all forms, though enforcement is difficult in endemic areas.

**3. Removal of Toxin (Detoxification)**
Since the toxin (BOAA) is water-soluble, it can be removed by:
*   **Steeping Method:** Soaking the pulse in hot water for 2 hours, draining the water, and drying the pulse. *Disadvantage:* Loss of vitamins/minerals.
*   **[[Parboiling]]:** Soaking in **lime water** overnight followed by boiling. This destroys the toxin and trypsin inhibitors.

**4. Genetic Approach**
*   Cultivation of low-toxin varieties of *Lathyrus* (strains containing very low levels of toxin, e.g., Pusa-24).

**5. Socio-economic Changes**
*   Improving the economic status of the poor so they are not forced to consume *Khesari dal* as a staple diet.

**6. Health Education**
*   Educating the public about the dangers of consuming the pulse and the need for toxin removal.

### **Mnemonics**

*   **BOAA** (The Toxin): Think of a **BOA Constrictor** snake squeezing the legs (causing paralysis).
*   **Clinical Stages:** "**L**et **N**o **O**ne **T**ake **C**rutches"
    *   **L** - Latent
    *   **N** - No-stick
    *   **O** - One-stick
    *   **T** - Two-stick
    *   **C** - Crawler
