# [[Infections Of Bone]] > Tuberculosis of Spine (Clinical Features and Cold Abscess)

# Tuberculosis of the Spine ([[Pott's Disease]])

### Introduction and Epidemiology
[[Tuberculosis of the spine]], also known as **Pott’s Disease** (named after Sir Percival Pott, 1779), is the most common form of skeletal tuberculosis, accounting for approximately 50% of all bone and joint TB cases.
*   **Causative Organism:** [[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]].
*   **Age:** Common in the first three decades of life, though no age is immune.
*   **Region:** The **dorso-lumbar region** (T12-L1) is the most frequently affected site due to maximum motion and stress.
*   **Route of Spread:** Hematogenous dissemination, often via the valveless vertebral venous plexus ([[Batson's plexus]]).

### Clinical Features
The onset is usually insidious (gradual). Symptoms can be broadly categorized into constitutional (systemic) and local.

#### 1. Symptoms
*   **Constitutional Symptoms:** These often antedate local spinal involvement.
    *   Low-grade fever (evening rise).
    *   Lassitude/Malaise.
    *   Loss of appetite and weight.
    *   Night sweats.
*   **Pain:**
    *   **Backache:** The earliest and most common symptom. Initially dull and vague, becoming localized to the affected segment.
    *   **Radicular Pain:** Pain radiating along the nerve root due to compression.
        *   *Cervical:* Arm pain.
        *   *Thoracic:* Girdle pain.
        *   *Lumbar:* Groin or thigh pain.
    *   **Night Cries:** Occur when muscle spasm relaxes during sleep, allowing inflamed surfaces to rub against each other.
*   **Stiffness:** An early protective mechanism where paravertebral muscles go into spasm to prevent movement at the diseased segment.
*   **Neurological Symptoms:** Weakness, clumsiness in gait, or altered sensibility (paresthesia) heralding [[Pott's paraplegia]].

#### 2. Physical Signs
*   **Gait and Posture:**
    *   **Alderman’s Gait:** The patient walks with short steps, keeping the back stiff and upright to avoid jarring the spine.
    *   **Military Attitude:** Seen in lower cervical/upper thoracic lesions; the patient keeps the head high and chin up.
    *   **Cervical Spine:** Patient may support the chin with their hands.
*   **Tenderness:** Elicited by applying pressure on the spinous process or attempting to rotate the vertebra.
*   **Muscle Spasm:** Paravertebral muscles appear prominent and rigid ("boarding").
*   **Deformity ([[Kyphosis]]):** The anterior column (vertebral body) collapses while the posterior column remains intact, leading to forward angulation.

**Types of Kyphotic Deformity**

| Type of Deformity | Description | Number of Vertebrae Involved |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Knuckle** | Sharp prominence of a single spinous process. | 1 Vertebra |
| **[[Gibbus]]** | Prominence of two or three spinous processes. | 2–3 Vertebrae |
| **Angular Kyphosis** | Angulation due to involvement of multiple vertebrae. | 3–4 Vertebrae |
| **Rounded Kyphosis** | Diffuse rounding of the spine. | > 4 Vertebrae (often seen in elderly) |

### Cold Abscess
A **[[Cold Abscess]]** is a collection of pus, tubercular debris, serum, and caseous material. It is termed "cold" because it lacks the classic signs of acute inflammation (heat, redness, severe pain).

#### Pathogenesis and Spread
Infection usually starts in the vertebral body (paradiscal type). As caseation progresses, pus forms and accumulates under the **Anterior Longitudinal Ligament (ALL)**. It then tracks along fascial planes, neurovascular bundles, or lines of least resistance.

#### Sites of Tracking/Presentation

| Region of Spine | Direction of Spread | Clinical Presentation/Location |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cervical Spine** | Anteriorly | **[[Retropharyngeal abscess]]** (may cause dysphagia/respiratory distress). |
| | Laterally | Posterior triangle of the neck (behind sternocleidomastoid). |
| | Downwards | Mediastinum or axilla. |
| **Thoracic Spine** | Anteriorly/Laterally | **Mediastinal abscess** (widened mediastinum on X-ray). |
| | Intercostal spaces | Lateral chest wall (along intercostal nerves). |
| | Downwards | Through diaphragm to form psoas abscess. |
| **Lumbar Spine** | Downwards | **[[Psoas abscess]]**: Tracks along psoas sheath. |
| | | **Groin:** Points below the inguinal ligament (medial thigh). |
| | | **Iliac fossa:** Palpable lump. |
| | Posteriorly | **Petit’s Triangle:** Lumbar abscess. |
| | Gluteal Region | Ischiorectal fossa. |

> **Clinical Implication:** A psoas abscess may cause a flexion deformity of the hip. The patient keeps the hip flexed to relax the psoas muscle. Extending the hip causes pain (Psoas Sign).

### Neurological Complications ([[Pott's Paraplegia]])
*   **Incidence:** Occurs in approximately 20% of cases.
*   **Most Common Site:** Thoracic spine (due to the narrow spinal canal and physiological kyphosis).
*   **Causes:**
    *   **Early Onset:** Inflammatory edema, granulation tissue, abscess, caseous material pressing on the cord.
    *   **Late Onset:** Recurrence of disease, internal gibbus (bony ridge), or severe deformity stretching the cord.
*   **Clinical Picture:** Varies from mild weakness (grade I) to complete loss of motor/sensory function with bladder/bowel involvement (grade IV).

### Differential Diagnosis
It is crucial to differentiate [[Tuberculosis of the spine]] from other spinal pathologies:

1.  **Pyogenic Spondylitis:** Acute onset, high fever, severe pain, rapid destruction.
2.  **Spinal Tumors (Metastasis/Multiple Myeloma):**
    *   **Disc Sparing:** Tumors affect the vertebral body but usually **spare the intervertebral disc** (unlike TB where disc space reduction is an early sign).
    *   **Winking Owl Sign:** Destruction of the pedicle on X-ray.
3.  **[[Prolapsed Intervertebral Disc]] (PIVD):** Radicular pain is prominent, but X-rays are usually normal (no bony destruction), and there are no constitutional symptoms.
4.  **[[Brucellosis]]:** Can mimic TB; requires serological testing.

### Mnemonics

**"COLD" Abscess Features:**
*   **C**hronic
*   **O**sseous origin (usually)
*   **L**acks acute inflammation (Heat/Redness)
*   **D**istant tracking (tracks far from the source)

**"PAD"** for TB Spine X-ray findings:
*   **P**aravertebral abscess (fusiform/bird nest)
*   **A**nterior wedging/collapse
*   **D**isc space narrowing (Earliest sign)
