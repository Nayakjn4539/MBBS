# [[OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH]] > Define Ergonomics. Discuss the importance of preplacement examination with suitable example

### Ergonomics

The term **Ergonomics** is derived from the Greek words *'Ergon'* meaning **work** and *'Nomos'* meaning **law**.

*   **Definition:** It is defined as the application of scientific information concerning objects, systems, and the environment for human use. In simple terms, it means **"Fitting the job to the worker"**.
*   **Objective:** The main object of [[Ergonomics]] is to achieve the best mutual adjustment of man and his work for the improvement of human efficiency and well-being.
*   **Scope:** It involves designing machines, tools, equipment, manufacturing processes, the layout of workspaces, and the environment to suit the physiological and psychological capabilities of the worker.

### Pre-placement Examination

The [[Pre-placement Examination]] (formerly known as pre-employment examination) is the **foundation** of an efficient occupational health service. It is conducted at the time of employment before the worker actually starts the job.

**Components:**
1.  Worker's medical, family, occupational, and social history.
2.  Thorough physical examination.
3.  Biological and radiological examinations (e.g., Chest X-ray, ECG, Vision testing, Urine and blood exams).

#### Importance of Pre-placement Examination

The primary purpose is **NOT** to reject a worker, but to ensure safety and efficiency.

1.  **Right Man in the Right Job:** The main aim is to place the worker in a job suited to their physical and mental capacities. This is the practical application of [[Ergonomics]].
2.  **Baseline Data:** It serves as a useful **benchmark** for future comparison. If a worker develops a condition later, the initial record proves whether the disease was pre-existing or occupationally acquired.
3.  **Safety:** It prevents the worker from undertaking hazardous tasks that would endanger their own life or the lives of others.
4.  **Productivity:** A worker who is physically fit for the specific task will have higher efficiency and work output.

#### Suitable Examples

It is medically risky to employ men suffering from certain diseases in specific occupations. The examination helps filter these high-risk pairings:

| **Condition/Disability** | **Unsuitable Occupation/Hazard** | **Reason/Risk** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Color Blindness / Poor Vision** | Driver, Pilot, Railway Signalman | High risk of accidents due to inability to distinguish signals. |
| **Potential Hernia** | Weight lifting, Heavy manual labor | Risk of strangulation or worsening of hernia. |
| **Healed or Active Tuberculosis** | Silica industry (Mining, Pottery, Sandblasting) | High risk of reactivating TB or developing [[Silico-tuberculosis]]. |
| **Asthma / Dermatitis** | Dyes and Chemical industries | Hypersensitivity can lead to severe allergic reactions or occupational asthma. |
| **Anemia / Hypertension** | Lead industry (Battery manufacturing) | Lead poisoning exacerbates anemia and hypertension. |
| **Kidney / Liver Disease** | Solvents industry | Compromised organs cannot detoxify industrial solvents effectively. |

**Clinical Relevance:**
If a worker with a history of **Epilepsy** is employed as a machine operator or at heights (scaffolding), a seizure during work could be fatal. A pre-placement exam identifies this risk, allowing the worker to be placed in a safer ground-level clerical job instead.
