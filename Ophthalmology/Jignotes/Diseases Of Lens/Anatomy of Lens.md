# [[Diseases Of Lens]] > Anatomy of Lens

### **General Features**

The **[[Crystalline Lens]]** is a transparent, biconvex, avascular, and crystalline structure placed between the [[Iris]] and the [[Vitreous Humour]] in a saucer-shaped depression called the **[[Patellar Fossa]]**.

*   **Shape:** Biconvex (Posterior surface is more convex than anterior).
*   **Color:** Transparent in youth; becomes yellowish/amber with age (due to urochrome pigment deposition).
*   **Refractive Index:**
    *   **Mean:** 1.39
    *   **Nucleus:** 1.41 (Higher index)
    *   **Cortex:** 1.38 (Lower index)
    *   *Note:* The variable refractive index corrects spherical aberration.
*   **Dioptric Power:** +15 to +16 D (in situ); approx. +19 D (in air).
*   **Accommodation Power:** Varies with age (14–16 D at birth; 1–2 D at 50 years).

### **Dimensions and Curvature**

| Parameter | Measurement | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Diameter** | 9–10 mm | Remains relatively constant after adult size is reached. |
| **Thickness** | 3.5 – 5.0 mm | Increases with age (continuous growth). |
| **Radius of Curvature (Anterior)** | 10 mm | Flatter surface; becomes steeper during [[Accommodation]]. |
| **Radius of Curvature (Posterior)** | 6 mm | Steeper surface; minimal change during accommodation. |
| **Weight** | 135 mg (0-9 yrs) to 255 mg (40-80 yrs) | Increases continuously throughout life. |

### **Microscopic Structure**

> Cross-section of the lens showing Capsule, Epithelium, Cortex, and Nucleus layers

The lens consists of three main parts:
1.  **Lens Capsule**
2.  **Lens Epithelium**
3.  **Lens Substance (Fibers)**

#### **1. Lens Capsule**
*   **Nature:** It is a thin, transparent, hyaline **basement membrane** (Type IV Collagen) secreted by the lens epithelium.
*   **Function:** Encloses the lens, shapes the lens during accommodation (moulds the lens substance).
*   **Thickness Variation:**
    *   **Thickest:** Anterior and Posterior Pre-equatorial zones (~14–21 $\mu$m).
    *   **Thinnest:** [[Posterior Pole]] (~3–4 $\mu$m).
*   **Clinical Implication:** The extreme thinness of the posterior capsule makes it vulnerable to rupture (Posterior Capsule Rupture - PCR) during cataract surgery.

#### **2. Lens Epithelium**
*   **Location:** Single layer of cuboidal cells lining the **anterior capsule** only. There is **NO posterior epithelium** (posterior cells are used up in embryonic development).
*   **Zones:**
    *   **Central Zone:** Non-dividing cells; involved in transport of metabolites.
    *   **Pre-equatorial/Germinative Zone:** Cells here are columnar and actively dividing (mitosis). These cells elongate to form new **[[Lens Fibers]]**.
*   **Function:** Secretes the capsule and regulates transport of water/ions (Pump mechanism).

#### **3. Lens Substance (Lens Fibers)**
The epithelial cells at the equator elongate to form lens fibers. As new fibers are formed, older fibers are pushed inward and compressed, losing their nuclei and organelles.
*   **Arrangement:** Concentric lamellae (like an onion).
*   **Cortex:**
    *   Peripheral part containing the **youngest fibers**.
    *   Soft consistency.
    *   Nucleated fibers.
*   **Nucleus:**
    *   Central part containing the **oldest fibers**.
    *   Hard/Sclerotic consistency.
    *   Anucleated fibers.

**Zones of the Nucleus (Developmental Layers):**
From center to periphery (Oldest to Youngest):
1.  **Embryonic Nucleus:** Formed during 1–3 months of gestation (Primary lens fibers).
2.  **Fetal Nucleus:** Formed from 3 months gestation to birth. Contains the **Y-Sutures**.
3.  **Infantile Nucleus:** Formed from birth to puberty.
4.  **Adult Nucleus:** Fibers formed after puberty.

**The Y-Sutures:**
Found in the **[[Fetal Nucleus]]**.
*   **Anterior:** Erect **Y** shape.
*   **Posterior:** Inverted **$\lambda$** shape.
*   *Clinical Implication:* Important for identifying the depth of opacities in congenital cataracts.

### **Zonules of Zinn (Suspensory Ligaments)**

These are a series of fibrillar structures holding the lens in position and transmitting ciliary muscle contraction forces for accommodation.
*   **Origin:** Pars plana and valleys of ciliary processes (Pars plicata) of the **[[Ciliary Body]]**.
*   **Insertion:** Lens equator.
*   **Parts (New Concept):**
    1.  **Pars orbicularis:** Meshwork over pars plana.
    2.  **Zonular plexus:** Network between ciliary processes.
    3.  **Zonular fork:** Divides into three limbs inserting into the lens:
        *   **Anterior zonular limb:** Inserts 1.5 mm anterior to equator.
        *   **Equatorial zonular limb:** Inserts at the equator.
        *   **Posterior zonular limb:** Inserts 1.25 mm posterior to equator.

**Attachments:**
*   **Ligament of Wieger:** Circular adhesion between the posterior lens capsule and the anterior vitreous face.
*   **Space of Berger:** A potential retrolental space between the lens and vitreous, within the ring of the Ligament of Wieger.

### **Biochemistry and Metabolism**

*   **Water Content:** 66% (Dehydrated state compared to other tissues).
*   **Protein Content:** 33% (Highest protein concentration in the body).
    *   **Water Soluble:** Crystallins ($\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$).
    *   **Water Insoluble:** Albuminoids (increase with age/cataract).
*   **Metabolism:**
    *   The lens is **avascular**. Nutrients (Glucose) come from the **[[Aqueous Humour]]** (major source) and vitreous.
    *   **Anaerobic Glycolysis (80%):** Major pathway; produces Lactic Acid.
    *   **HMP Shunt & Kreb's Cycle:** Minor pathways.
    *   **Sorbitol Pathway:** Normally inactive. In diabetes (hyperglycemia), glucose converts to sorbitol (via Aldose Reductase), which cannot diffuse out, causing osmotic swelling and **[[Diabetic Cataract]]** (Snowflake cataract).

**Factors Maintaining Transparency:**
1.  Avascularity.
2.  Tightly packed lens fibers with narrow membranes.
3.  Regular arrangement of fibers (lattice theory).
4.  Loss of organelles in mature fibers.
5.  **Pump Mechanism:** Active Na+/K+ ATPase pump keeps the lens relatively dehydrated.
6.  **Antioxidants:** High concentration of **Glutathione** and Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) prevents oxidative damage.

### **Embryology**

*   **Origin:** **[[Surface Ectoderm]]**.
*   **Timeline:** Begins at 4mm stage (approx. 3-4 weeks gestation).
*   **Sequence:** Lens Placode $\rightarrow$ Lens Pit $\rightarrow$ Lens Vesicle $\rightarrow$ Separation from Surface Ectoderm.
*   *Note:* The lens capsule is the basement membrane of the invaginated surface ectoderm.

### **Clinical Implications**

1.  **[[Cataract]]**: Any opacity in the lens or its capsule.
    *   *Cortical Cataract:* Hydration of cortex (cuneiform opacities).
    *   *Nuclear Cataract:* Sclerosis of nucleus (Index myopia/Second Sight).
2.  **Subluxation/Dislocation**: Caused by weakness or rupture of **[[Zonules]]**. Seen in Trauma, Marfan's Syndrome (Supero-temporal), and Homocystinuria (Infero-nasal).
3.  **Presbyopia**: Physiological loss of accommodation due to hardening of the lens substance and loss of capsule elasticity with age.
4.  **Phacolytic Glaucoma**: Leakage of high molecular weight lens proteins through an intact capsule in hypermature cataract clogs the trabecular meshwork.
