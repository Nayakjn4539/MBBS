# [[OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH]] > Ergonomics

### **ERGONOMICS (Human Engineering)**

**Definition**
The term **Ergonomics** is derived from two Greek words:
*   *Ergon* = Work
*   *Nomos* = Law
It literally means the laws of work. In the context of [[Occupational Health]], it is defined as **"Fitting the job to the worker"**.

It is the scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of interactions among humans and other elements of a system.

**Objective**
The primary object of ergonomics is to achieve the best **mutual adjustment** of man and his work, for the improvement of human efficiency and well-being.

**Key Components**
Training in ergonomics involves designing the following to suit the worker's physiological and psychological capabilities:
1.  **Tools and Equipment:** Designing hand tools that fit the hand, machines with controls within easy reach.
2.  **Machinery:** Ensuring guards and safety stops are accessible.
3.  **Manufacturing Processes:** Reducing repetitive strain.
4.  **Layout of Workplaces:** Proper height of desks/workbenches.
5.  **Methods of Work:** Work-rest cycles.
6.  **Environment:** Control of [[Physical Environment: Place of Work]] factors like lighting, noise, and temperature.

### **Types of Ergonomics**

| Type | Focus Area | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Physical Ergonomics** | Human body's responses to physical and physiological stress. | Posture, material handling, repetitive movements, musculoskeletal disorders. |
| **Cognitive Ergonomics** | Mental processes affecting interactions between humans and systems. | Mental workload, decision-making, human-computer interaction, work stress. |
| **Organizational Ergonomics** (Macroergonomics) | Optimization of sociotechnical systems, structures, and policies. | Communication, teamwork, work design, shift management, telework. |,

### **Application in Occupational Health**

**1. Prevention of Accidents**
*   **Human Factor:** Human failure is responsible for a majority of [[Industrial Accidents]]. Ergonomics reduces fatigue and mental stress, thereby reducing errors.
*   **Machine Factor:** Designing machines with automatic protection (safety guards) reduces mechanical hazards.,

**2. Pre-placement Examination**
*   This is the foundation of an efficient occupational health service.
*   The purpose is to place the **"Right man in the right job"** so that the worker can perform duties efficiently without detriment to health. This is a core principle of ergonomics.

**3. Reducing Sickness Absenteeism**
*   Application of ergonomics is a proven method for reducing [[Sickness Absenteeism]] by minimizing physical strain and improving job satisfaction.

**4. Design of Work Environment**
*   **Lighting:** Preventing glare and shadows to reduce eye strain.
*   **Ventilation:** Ensuring thermal comfort (Comfort Zone) to prevent [[Heat Stress]].
*   **Noise:** Reducing noise levels to prevent [[Occupational Deafness]].,

### **Clinical Relevance**

Failure to apply ergonomic principles leads to:
*   **Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs):** Backache, joint pain, neck pain.
*   **Repetitive Strain Injuries:** Carpal tunnel syndrome, tenosynovitis.
*   **Fatigue:** Both physical and mental exhaustion.
*   **"White Fingers":** Due to exposure to vibrations from pneumatic tools.
*   **Accidents:** Increased proneness to injury due to awkward postures or poorly designed controls.

### **Mnemonic**

To remember the goals of Ergonomics, think of **"EFECT"**:
*   **E** - Efficiency (Increased)
*   **F** - Fatigue (Decreased)
*   **E** - Errors (Reduced)
*   **C** - Comfort (Improved)
*   **T** - Trauma/Injury (Prevented)
