# Disorders of Trachea

The [[trachea]] (windpipe) is a membranocartilaginous tube extending from the cricoid cartilage (C6) to the carina (T5). Disorders of the trachea can be broadly classified into congenital, inflammatory/infectious, traumatic, neoplastic, and structural/acquired conditions.

### I. Congenital Disorders of the Trachea

These conditions present at birth or shortly thereafter, typically manifesting with [[stridor]], respiratory distress, or feeding difficulties.

#### 1. Tracheoesophageal Fistula (TEF) and Esophageal Atresia
A developmental failure of the separation between the trachea and esophagus.
*   **Pathophysiology:** Fusion failure of the lateral furrows creating the [[tracheoesophageal septum]] during the 5th–7th weeks of gestation.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Type I:** Esophageal atresia without fistula (blind pouches).
    *   **Type II:** Upper esophageal segment communicates with trachea; lower is blind.
    *   **Type III (Most Common - 82%):** Upper segment is blind; lower segment communicates with trachea.
    *   **Type IV (H-type):** Both segments communicate, or an intact esophagus connects to the trachea (H-type is not associated with atresia).
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Polyhydramnios (maternal history).
    *   Choking, coughing, and cyanosis during feeding.
    *   Abdominal distension (due to air entering the stomach via fistula).
    *   Recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   Inability to pass a nasogastric tube.
    *   Chest X-ray (coiling of the tube).
    *   Contrast studies (cineradiography/fluoroscopy).
*   **Management:** Surgical repair (ligation of fistula and anastomosis of esophagus). Gastrostomy for nutrition initially.

#### 2. Tracheomalacia
Flaccidity of the tracheal support cartilage leading to tracheal collapse, especially during expiration.
*   **Etiology:**
    *   **Primary:** Intrinsic abnormality of cartilage/muscle ratio (normal 4:1 decreases to 2:1).
    *   **Secondary:** Extrinsic compression by vascular rings (e.g., [[double aortic arch]]), mediastinal tumors, or cysts.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Expiratory stridor** (or biphasic).
    *   "Dying spells" (apnea and cyanosis) or reflex apnea.
    *   Barking cough.
    *   Symptoms worsen with agitation, crying, or feeding.
*   **Diagnosis:** [[Microlaryngoscopy]] and [[bronchoscopy]] (gold standard) to visualize collapse.
*   **Management:**
    *   Mild cases (<75% collapse): Observation (usually resolves by 2 years).
    *   Severe cases: Surgical suspension (aortopexy) or stenting.

#### 3. Congenital Tracheal Stenosis
*   **Pathology:** Complete tracheal rings (stove-pipe trachea) or cartilage hypoplasia.
*   **Presentation:** Stridor (biphasic), severe respiratory distress precipitated by URTI.
*   **Management:** Slide tracheoplasty or resection with end-to-end anastomosis.

### II. Inflammatory and Infectious Disorders

#### 1. Acute Laryngotracheobronchitis (Croup)
The most common infectious cause of airway obstruction in children (6 months – 3 years).
*   **Etiology:** Viral (Parainfluenza types I, II, III).
*   **Pathology:** Edema of the loose areolar tissue in the [[subglottis]] (narrowest part of pediatric airway).
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Prodromal URI symptoms.
    *   **Barking/seal-like cough.**
    *   Inspiratory stridor (later becomes biphasic).
    *   Hoarseness.
    *   Low-grade fever.
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   Clinical diagnosis.
    *   X-ray Neck (AP View): **Steeple Sign** (pencil-tip narrowing of the subglottic airway).
*   **Management:**
    *   Humidification (mist tent).
    *   Systemic [[steroids]] (Dexamethasone).
    *   Nebulized [[adrenaline]] (epinephrine) for mucosal vasoconstriction.
    *   Intubation in severe obstruction.

#### 2. Bacterial Tracheitis (Pseudomembranous Croup)
A bacterial superinfection of viral croup, often life-threatening.
*   **Etiology:** *Staphylococcus aureus* (MC), *Moraxella catarrhalis*, *H. influenzae*.
*   **Pathology:** Thick, purulent secretions and crusting within the trachea leading to obstruction ("Toxic Croup").
*   **Clinical Features:** High fever, toxicity, poor response to croup therapy (adrenaline), biphasic stridor.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Airway:** Intubation or rigid [[bronchoscopy]] for toileting (removal of crusts).
    *   **Medical:** IV Antibiotics.

#### 3. Diphtheria (Laryngeal/Tracheal)
*   **Etiology:** *Corynebacterium diphtheriae*.
*   **Features:** Greyish-white, adherent pseudomembrane covering larynx/trachea; removal causes bleeding. "Bull-neck" appearance (lymphadenopathy).
*   **Management:** Diphtheria antitoxin + Penicillin/Erythromycin + Airway management.

#### 4. Scleroma (Rhinoscleroma)
*   **Etiology:** *Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis*.
*   **Pathology:** Chronic granulomatous condition. Can spread from nose to subglottis and trachea.
*   **Stages:** Catarrhal $\rightarrow$ Granulomatous $\rightarrow$ Sclerotic (Stenosis).
*   **Treatment:** Streptomycin, Tetracycline, Rifampicin; Surgical dilation for stenosis.

### III. Traumatic Disorders of Trachea

#### 1. Foreign Body Aspiration
*   **Epidemiology:** Common in children 1–4 years.
*   **Common Objects:** Peanuts, seeds, plastic parts.
*   **Site:** Right main bronchus is wider, shorter, and more vertical, making it the most common site, but objects can lodge in the trachea.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Initial:** Choking, gagging, coughing crisis.
    *   **Tracheal FB:** Audible slap (palpatory thud), asthmatoid wheeze.
    *   **Late:** Pneumonia, atelectasis, obstructive emphysema.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Heimlich Maneuver:** For acute complete obstruction in conscious adults/children.
    *   **Bronchoscopy:** Rigid bronchoscopy with optical forceps is the definitive treatment for removal.

**Mnemonic for Foreign Body Aspiration:**
**P** - Peanuts (MC)
**E** - Expiratory stridor/Wheeze
**A** - Air trapping (Obstructive emphysema)
**N** - No blind finger sweeps
**U** - Unilateral findings (usually right side)
**T** - Tracheal slap

#### 2. External Trauma
*   **Types:**
    *   **Blunt:** Dashboard injury, strangulation, clothesline injury. Can cause tracheal separation or fracture.
    *   **Penetrating:** Stab or gunshot wounds.
*   **Signs:** [[Surgical emphysema]] (subcutaneous crepitus), hemoptysis, stridor, flattening of anterior neck contour.
*   **Management:** Secure airway (Tracheostomy/Intubation) $\rightarrow$ Surgical exploration and repair.

#### 3. Inhalational Injury
*   Thermal burns or chemical fumes causing mucosal edema, sloughing, and subsequent stenosis.

### IV. Acquired Structural Disorders

#### 1. Laryngotracheal Stenosis (LTS)
Narrowing of the airway at the level of the glottis, subglottis, or trachea.
*   **Etiology:**
    *   **Iatrogenic (Most Common):** Prolonged [[endotracheal intubation]] (cuff pressure > capillary perfusion pressure > 30 mmHg causes ischemia $\rightarrow$ necrosis $\rightarrow$ fibrosis).
    *   Trauma (external).
    *   High [[tracheostomy]] (involving 1st ring/cricoid).
    *   Systemic diseases: Wegener’s granulomatosis, Sarcoidosis, Amyloidosis.
*   **Clinical Features:** Difficulty in extubation, exertional dyspnea, stridor (biphasic or expiratory), inability to clear secretions.
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   CT Neck/Chest (3D reconstruction).
    *   Rigid Endoscopy (Gold standard for staging).
    *   **Myer-Cotton Grading System:**
        *   Grade I: 0-50% obstruction
        *   Grade II: 51-70% obstruction
        *   Grade III: 71-99% obstruction
        *   Grade IV: No detectable lumen
*   **Management:**
    *   **Endoscopic:** CO2 Laser radial cuts, Balloon dilation, Mitomycin-C application (antifibroblastic).
    *   **Open Surgery:**
        *   **Anterior Cricoid Split:** For neonates.
        *   **Laryngotracheal Reconstruction (LTR):** Using costal cartilage grafts (anterior/posterior).
        *   **Tracheal Resection and Anastomosis:** For short-segment stenosis.
        *   **Stenting:** Montgomery T-tube or silicone stents.

#### 2. Tracheoesophageal Fistula (Acquired)
*   **Causes:** Malignancy (esophageal/tracheal), prolonged cuff pressure from tracheostomy/ET tube, trauma.
*   **Symptoms:** Coughing while eating (Ono’s sign), recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
*   **Management:** Surgical repair (interposition of muscle flap) or stenting.

### V. Neoplasms of the Trachea

Primary tracheal tumors are rare. Secondary invasion from thyroid, esophageal, or laryngeal cancer is more common.

| Feature | **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** | **Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frequency** | Most common primary malignancy | Second most common |
| **Origin** | Respiratory epithelium | Submucosal glands |
| **Growth** | Rapid, ulcerative/fungating | Slow, submucosal, infiltrative |
| **Spread** | Lymphatic spread to paratracheal nodes | Perineural spread |
| **Treatment** | Surgery + Radiotherapy | Surgery + Radiotherapy |

**Benign Tumors:**
*   **Squamous Papilloma:** Associated with HPV 6 & 11. Can be part of Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP).
*   **Chondroma:** Cartilaginous tumor.
*   **Hemangioma:** Subglottic (common in infants).

### VI. Summary of Tracheal Investigations

*   **X-ray Soft Tissue Neck/Chest:** Steeple sign (Croup), Thumb sign (Epiglottitis - supraglottic but relevant DD), Foreign body visualization.
*   **CT Scan:** Best for defining bony/cartilaginous framework, stenosis length, and tumors.
*   **MRI:** Best for soft tissue extension and vascular rings.
*   **Bronchoscopy (Rigid/Flexible):** Diagnostic and therapeutic (biopsy, FB removal, dilation).
*   **Pulmonary Function Tests:** Flow-volume loops show flattening (fixed vs. variable obstruction).
