# [[Ear]] > Ototoxicity

### Definition
**Ototoxicity** is defined as the capacity of a drug or chemical to damage the inner ear structures or derange their function, leading to functional impairment of the auditory (hearing) or vestibular (balance) systems. The damage may be temporary (reversible) or permanent (irreversible).

### Pathophysiology
The mechanism of damage varies by the agent involved, but generally targets specific structures within the [[Inner Ear]]:

*   **Target Structures:**
    *   **[[Outer Hair Cells]] (OHCs):** Most commonly affected, initially at the **basal turn** of the cochlea (leading to high-frequency hearing loss) and progressing towards the apex.
    *   **[[Inner Hair Cells]] (IHCs):** Affected in later stages or with higher doses.
    *   **[[Stria Vascularis]]:** Specifically affected by loop diuretics (causing edema and cystic changes).
    *   **[[Spiral Ganglion]] Cells:** Progressive destruction occurs, particularly with aminoglycosides.
*   **Cellular Mechanism:**
    *   Many drugs (e.g., aminoglycosides, cisplatin) generate **free radicals (reactive oxygen species)** within the inner ear fluids and tissues, leading to apoptosis (programmed cell death) of the hair cells.
    *   Modification of the ionic composition of inner ear fluids (e.g., diuretics affecting Na+/K+ transport).

### Classification of Ototoxic Drugs
Drugs can be classified based on the specific part of the inner ear they damage or the reversibility of the damage.

#### 1. Aminoglycoside Antibiotics
These are the most common cause of severe ototoxicity. They interfere with protein synthesis and cause hair cell death.
*   **Risk Factors:** Renal dysfunction, elderly age (>65), simultaneous use of loop diuretics, genetic susceptibility (mitochondrial RNA mutation), and prolonged therapy.
*   **Toxicity Types:**
    *   **Cochleotoxic (Auditory damage):** Preferentially damage OHCs.
    *   **Vestibulotoxic (Balance damage):** Preferentially damage Type I hair cells of the [[Crista Ampullaris]].

| Drug Class | Examples | Mnemonic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cochleotoxic** | **K**anamycin, **A**mikacin, **N**eomycin, Dihydrostreptomycin | **KAN** (means "Ear" in Hindi) |
| **Vestibulotoxic** | **N**etilmicin, **S**treptomycin, **G**entamicin, **T**obramycin | **NSG-T** (Terrorists feel dizzy seeing NSG commandos) |

**Clinical Implications:**
*   **Neomycin** is the *most* cochleotoxic and is restricted to topical use; however, it can still cause damage if absorbed through a perforated [[Tympanic Membrane]].
*   **Streptomycin** is highly vestibulotoxic and is used therapeutically for chemical labyrinthectomy in intractable [[Ménière's Disease]].

#### 2. Loop Diuretics
*   **Drugs:** Furosemide (Lasix), Ethacrynic acid, Bumetanide.
*   **Site of Action:** **[[Stria Vascularis]]**. They block Na+/Cl- transport in the ascending loop of Henle and cause edema in the stria vascularis.
*   **Features:**
    *   Usually causes **reversible** hearing loss.
    *   Can cause **permanent** loss if given in high doses or combined with aminoglycosides (synergistic effect).

#### 3. Cytotoxic / Chemotherapy Agents
*   **Drugs:** **Cisplatin**, Carboplatin, Nitrogen mustard.
*   **Pathology:** Destruction of [[Outer Hair Cells]].
*   **Features:**
    *   Causes **permanent**, bilateral, symmetrical **[[Sensorineural Hearing Loss]] (SNHL)**.
    *   High frequencies are affected first.
    *   Tinnitus is common.

#### 4. Antimalarials
*   **Drugs:** Quinine, Chloroquine.
*   **Pathology:** Vasoconstriction in the small vessels of the cochlea and stria vascularis.
*   **Features:**
    *   Tinnitus and SNHL (usually **reversible**).
    *   **Congenital deafness** and cochlear hypoplasia if taken during the first trimester of pregnancy.

#### 5. Salicylates (Analgesics)
*   **Drugs:** Aspirin, NSAIDs.
*   **Features:**
    *   Bilateral high-frequency SNHL and **[[Tinnitus]]**.
    *   Usually **reversible** upon discontinuation of the drug.
    *   Mechanism likely enzymatic interference rather than structural damage.

#### 6. Topical Ear Drops
*   Use of drops containing aminoglycosides (e.g., Neomycin, Gentamicin) or Chlorhexidine in the presence of a tympanic membrane perforation allows absorption into the inner ear through the **round window**, leading to SNHL.

### Clinical Features
1.  **[[Tinnitus]]:** Often the first warning symptom. Usually high-pitched and continuous.
2.  **[[Sensorineural Hearing Loss]]:**
    *   Typically bilateral and symmetrical.
    *   Starts at **high frequencies** (basal turn of cochlea) and progresses to lower speech frequencies.
    *   Pure Tone Audiogram (PTA) shows a **down-sloping curve**.
3.  **Vestibular Symptoms (Disequilibrium):**
    *   Vertigo is less common than unsteadiness.
    *   **Oscillopsia (Bobbing Oscillopsia):** Inability to focus on visual targets during head movement (e.g., reading while walking) due to bilateral loss of the vestibulo-ocular reflex.
    *   Ataxia aggravated by dark environments (loss of visual fixation).

### Investigations and Monitoring
Early detection is critical to prevent permanent handicap.

*   **Baseline Audiometry:** Must be performed before starting potential ototoxic drugs.
*   **High-Frequency Audiometry:** Tests frequencies from 8,000 Hz to 20,000 Hz. This is the **most sensitive** behavioral test as toxicity affects these frequencies first.
*   **[[Otoacoustic Emissions]] (OAEs):** specifically Distortion Product OAEs (DPOAEs).
    *   Detects function of [[Outer Hair Cells]].
    *   Can detect damage *before* it becomes visible on a standard audiogram.
*   **Renal Function Tests:** Monitor serum creatinine/BUN, as renal failure increases serum levels of ototoxic drugs.

### Management and Prevention
There is no specific cure for established ototoxic damage; prevention is key.

1.  **Prevention:**
    *   Use non-ototoxic alternatives when possible.
    *   Monitor peak and trough serum levels of drugs (e.g., aminoglycosides).
    *   Serial monitoring with High-Frequency Audiometry and OAEs.
    *   Avoid noise exposure during treatment (synergistic damage).
    *   *Note:* Avoid combining loop diuretics with aminoglycosides.
2.  **Active Treatment:**
    *   **Stop the drug** immediately if tinnitus or hearing loss develops (may reverse damage in cases of aspirin/diuretics/quinine).
    *   No specific antidote exists, though antioxidants (e.g., Sodium Thiosulfate) are being researched for Cisplatin toxicity.
3.  **Rehabilitation:**
    *   **Hearing Aids:** For permanent hearing loss.
    *   **[[Cochlear Implant]]:** For profound bilateral SNHL.
    *   **Vestibular Rehabilitation:** Exercises to compensate for balance loss.
