# [[Health Care Of The Community]] > Job Responsibilities of Health Workers

### **Job Responsibilities of Health Workers**

The delivery of [[Primary Health Care]] in India relies heavily on the efficient functioning of grassroots-level workers. These workers act as the interface between the community and the public health system.

---

### **1. Multi-Purpose Worker (Female) / ANM (Auxiliary Nurse Midwife)**
The MPW (F) is the key field functionary at the **Sub-centre level** (covering 5000 population in plains, 3000 in hilly/tribal areas).

**Key Responsibilities:**

*   **Maternal and Child Health (MCH):**
    *   **Antenatal Care:** Register every pregnant woman within 12 weeks. Conduct 4 ANC visits. Test urine for albumin/sugar and estimate Hemoglobin. Distribute [[Iron and Folic Acid]] tablets.
    *   **Intranatal:** Conduct safe deliveries (if trained/facilities available) and refer high-risk cases.
    *   **Postnatal:** Make home visits on days 0, 3, 7, and 42 for home deliveries (for institutional, start from day 3) to monitor mother and baby.
*   **Family Planning:**
    *   Maintain the **Eligible Couple Register**.
    *   Distribute conventional contraceptives (Condoms, OCPs) and motivate couples for permanent methods.
*   **Immunization:**
    *   Immunize pregnant women with Tetanus Toxoid (TT).
    *   Administer vaccines to infants/children as per the **National Immunization Schedule**.
    *   Maintain the **Cold Chain** for vaccines.

### **2. Multi-Purpose Worker (Male) / MPW (M)**
The MPW (M) works alongside the ANM at the Sub-centre but focuses more on environmental health and communicable disease control.

**Key Responsibilities:**

*   **National Vector Borne Disease Control ([[NVBDCP]]):**
    *   **Active Surveillance:** Visit every house once a fortnight (every 14 days) to detect fever cases.
    *   **Slide Collection:** Collect thick and thin blood smears for malaria diagnosis.
    *   **Treatment:** Administer radical treatment for positive malaria cases.
    *   **Vector Control:** Supervise spraying of insecticides and larvicidal measures.
*   **Communicable Diseases:**
    *   Identify and notify the Medical Officer about outbreaks of diarrhea, encephalitis, jaundice, or fever with rash.
    *   Educate the community on the prevention of communicable diseases.
*   **Environmental Sanitation:**
    *   Chlorinate public water sources/wells regularly.
    *   Promote the construction of soakage pits and sanitary latrines.
*   **Health Education:** Educate the community on personal hygiene, safe water, and disposal of waste.
*   **Record Keeping:** Maintain survey registers and malaria passive surveillance registers.

> **Clinical Relevance:** The MPW (Male) is the **first line of defense** in malaria control. If he fails to visit homes fortnightly, the [[Annual Parasite Incidence]] (API) data becomes unreliable, leading to outbreaks.
