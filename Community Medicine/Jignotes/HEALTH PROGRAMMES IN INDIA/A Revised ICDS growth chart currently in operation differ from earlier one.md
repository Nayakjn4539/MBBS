# [[HEALTH PROGRAMMES IN INDIA]] > A Revised ICDS growth chart currently in operation differ from earlier one

### Revised ICDS Growth Chart vs. Earlier Growth Chart

The Government of India adopted the new **[[WHO Child Growth Standards 2006]]** in February 2009 for monitoring young child growth and development within the **[[National Rural Health Mission]]** (NRHM) and the **[[Integrated Child Development Services]]** (ICDS). This replaced the earlier charts based on Harvard/NCHS standards.

### Key Differences: At a Glance

| Feature | Earlier ICDS Growth Chart | Revised ICDS Growth Chart (Current) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Reference Standard** | Based on **Harvard Standards** (or NCHS). Data from Boston, USA (1930-1956). | Based on **[[WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study]] (MGRS)** (1997-2003) conducted in 6 countries: Brazil, Ghana, **India**, Norway, Oman, and USA. |
| **Feeding Pattern of Reference Population** | Based on children who were mostly **bottle-fed** or mixed-fed. | Based on infants who were **exclusively breastfed** for at least 4 months (now recommended 6 months). |
| **Philosophy** | **Descriptive:** Described how children *were* growing at that time (regardless of health behaviors). | **Prescriptive:** Describes how children *should* grow when their health and nutritional needs are met (Normative approach). |
| **Gender Specificity** | **Unisex:** Single chart used for both boys and girls. | **Gender Specific:** Separate charts for **Boys** (Blue border) and **Girls** (Pink border) because they grow differently. |
| **Statistical Measure** | Used **Percentages of Median**. Classifications were Grade I, II, III, IV (Gomez classification). | Uses **[[Z-scores]]** (Standard Deviation scores). |
| **Curves/Lines** | Had **4 curves**: 80%, 70%, 60%, and 50% of the standard median. | Has **3 curves**: Median, -2 SD, and -3 SD. |
| **Classification of Malnutrition** | Classified into Normal, Grade I, II, III, and IV malnutrition. | Classified into **Normal**, **Moderately Underweight**, and **Severely Underweight**. |
| **Age Range** | Typically tracked up to 6 years. | Tracks growth from **0 to 5 years** (60 months). |

### Rationale for the Change
The earlier standards (Harvard/NCHS) were found to be less applicable to Indian children because:
1.  **Breastfeeding:** The old charts were based on bottle-fed babies who gain weight differently than breastfed babies. The new standards establish the **[[breastfed infant]]** as the biological norm.
2.  **Universal Potential:** The MGRS study showed that children under five years have the same potential to grow regardless of ethnicity, provided their basic needs (nutrition, environment, health) are met.
3.  **Early Faltering:** The old charts often failed to detect early growth faltering in the first 6 months (where breastfed babies might appear underweight compared to bottle-fed peers).

### Structure of the Revised Chart
*   **Axes:**
    *   **X-axis (Month axis):** Represents age. Has 5 boxes (for 5 years), each with 12 squares representing months (Total 60 squares).
    *   **Y-axis (Weight axis):** Represents weight in kg and grams.
*   **Color Coded Bands (Zones):**
    *   **Green Zone (Normal):** Area above the 2nd curve (-2 SD). Indicates the child is healthy.
    *   **Yellow Zone (Moderately Underweight):** Area between the 2nd curve (-2 SD) and 3rd curve (-3 SD). Indicates moderate acute malnutrition.
    *   **Orange Zone (Severely Underweight):** Area below the 3rd curve (-3 SD). Indicates **[[Severe Acute Malnutrition]]** (SAM).

### Clinical Relevance & Interpretation
*   **Direction is Key:** More than the position of the dot, the **direction of the growth curve** is vital.
    *   **Upward Curve:** Good; child is growing.
    *   **Flat Curve (Stagnation):** Dangerous; child is not gaining weight.
    *   **Downward Curve:** Very dangerous; child is losing weight and needs immediate referral.
*   **Identification of Risk:** If a child's curve crosses a pre-printed line (e.g., shifting from Green towards Yellow), it indicates a risk that requires early intervention, even if the child is not yet malnourished.

### Mnemonic for New Features
**"WHO GAVE"**
*   **W**HO MGRS Standards (2006)
*   **H**ow they *Should* grow (Prescriptive)
*   **O**ptimal feeding (Breastfeeding is the norm)
*   **G**ender specific (Pink/Blue)
*   **A**ge 0-5 years
*   **V**isual Zones (Green, Yellow, Orange)
*   **E**xclusive breastfeeding support
