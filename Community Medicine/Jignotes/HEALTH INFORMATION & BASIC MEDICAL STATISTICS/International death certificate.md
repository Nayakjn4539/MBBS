# [[HEALTH INFORMATION & BASIC MEDICAL STATISTICS]] > International death certificate

### International Death Certificate
**(Medical Certification of Cause of Death)**

The **International Death Certificate** is the basis of [[Mortality Data]] globally. It is a vital record signed by a licensed physician that ensures national and international comparability of mortality statistics. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a uniform and standardized system for recording these deaths.

### Structure of the Certificate
The certificate is divided into two distinct parts:

#### **Part I: The Chain of Events**
This section records the sequence of events leading to death. It is arranged from the immediate cause back to the originating cause.
*   **Line I (a): Immediate Cause**
    *   The disease or condition directly leading to death.
    *   *Note:* This does not mean the **mode of dying** (e.g., heart failure, respiratory failure, asthenia). It must be the specific disease or injury.
*   **Line I (b): Antecedent Cause**
    *   The morbid condition that gave rise to the cause listed in I(a).
*   **Line I (c): [[Underlying Cause of Death]]**
    *   The condition that started the sequence.
    *   If there are more steps, lines (d) can be added. The condition listed on the **lowest used line** of Part I is the Underlying Cause.

#### **Part II: Other Significant Conditions**
*   Records any significant disease or condition that contributed to the fatal outcome but was **not** related to the disease or condition causing it (not part of the sequence in Part I).

### The Underlying Cause of Death (UCOD)
This is the most important entry for epidemiological and statistical purposes. It is defined by the WHO as:
1.  The disease or injury which **initiated the train of morbid events** leading directly to death; OR
2.  The circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury.

> **Concept:** Line I(c) (or the lowest line used in Part I) is known as the **"Essence of the Death Certificate"**. Mortality statistics are usually tabulated based on this single cause.

### Approximate Interval
Space is provided against each condition to record the time interval between the **presumed onset** and the **date of death**.
*   **Significance:** It provides a check on the logical sequence of causes (e.g., the underlying cause must precede the immediate cause) and provides data on the duration of illness.

### Example of a Correctly Filled Certificate
*   **Part I (a):** Renal Failure (Immediate Cause) — *Due to*
*   **Part I (b):** Diabetic Nephropathy (Antecedent Cause) — *Due to*
*   **Part I (c):** [[Diabetes Mellitus]] (Underlying Cause)
*   **Part II:** Hypertension (Contributing Condition)

### Limitations of Mortality Data
1.  **Incomplete Reporting:** Many deaths in developing countries go unregistered.
2.  **Lack of Accuracy:** Errors in diagnosis or inexperience of the certifying doctor.
3.  **Single Cause Tabulation:** Most countries tabulate data only based on the Underlying Cause, ignoring contributing factors in Part II, which results in lost information.
4.  **Mode of Dying:** Doctors frequently incorrectly list "Cardio-respiratory arrest" as the cause, which is a mechanism of death, not the cause.

### Mnemonics
**To remember the order of Part I:**
**"I Am Under"**
*   **I** - **I**mmediate cause (Top line)
*   **A** - **A**ntecedent cause (Middle line)
*   **U** - **U**nderlying cause (Bottom line - The Boss/The Essence)

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Public Health Policy:** Accurate filling of the certificate is crucial because health priorities and resource allocation (e.g., funding for cancer vs. heart disease) are determined by the **Underlying Cause** statistics derived from these certificates.
*   **Preventive Action:** By identifying the UCOD, we identify the target for primary prevention (e.g., preventing Diabetes prevents the Renal Failure that ultimately killed the patient).
