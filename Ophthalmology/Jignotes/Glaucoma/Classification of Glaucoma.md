# [[Glaucoma]] > Classification of Glaucoma

### Classification of Glaucoma

Glaucoma is not a single disease entity but a group of disorders characterized by progressive [[optic neuropathy]] resulting in a characteristic appearance of the [[optic disc]] and a specific pattern of irreversible [[visual field defects]], frequently associated with raised [[intraocular pressure]] (IOP),.

The classification of glaucoma is multifactorial, based on etiology (primary vs. secondary), anatomy of the anterior chamber angle (open vs. closed), and age of onset (congenital vs. adult).

---

### I. Broad Etiological Classification

Glaucoma is broadly divided into three main categories,,:
1.  **Primary Glaucoma:** Occurs without any obvious systemic or ocular cause for the rise in IOP.
2.  **Secondary Glaucoma:** The rise in IOP is associated with a specific anomaly or disease of the eye (systemic or ocular).
3.  **Congenital/Developmental Glaucoma:** Associated with developmental anomalies of the [[angle of anterior chamber]].

---

### II. Anatomical Classification (Gonioscopic)

Based on the width of the angle of the anterior chamber and the visibility of the [[trabecular meshwork]], glaucoma is classified into two main types,:

| Type | Mechanism | Gonioscopy Findings |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Open Angle Glaucoma]]** | The angle is open, but aqueous outflow is obstructed at the level of the trabecular meshwork or beyond. | Angle structures are visible; no iris-cornea contact. |
| **[[Angle Closure Glaucoma]]** | The peripheral iris is in apposition to the cornea, mechanically blocking aqueous access to the trabecular meshwork. | Angle structures are obscured; iris touches the trabecular meshwork. |

### III. Primary Adult Glaucomas

These are conditions occurring in adults where the glaucoma is the primary pathology,.

#### 1. [[Primary Open Angle Glaucoma]] (POAG)
Also known as chronic simple glaucoma. It is characterized by,:
*   Slowly progressive rise in IOP (>21 mm Hg).
*   Open, normal-appearing anterior chamber angle.
*   Characteristic [[glaucomatous optic disc cupping]].
*   Specific [[visual field defects]].

**Variants of POAG:**
*   **[[Normal Tension Glaucoma]] (NTG):** Typical glaucomatous disc and field changes with an IOP consistently below 21 mm Hg,.
*   **[[Ocular Hypertension]]:** IOP consistently >21 mm Hg without optic disc or visual field changes,.

#### 2. [[Primary Angle Closure Disease]] (PACD)
This is a spectrum of conditions where the peripheral iris obstructs the trabecular meshwork,.

**Mechanisms:**
*   **With Pupillary Block:** Relative pupillary block leads to iris bombé and angle closure (Most common),.
*   **Without Pupillary Block:** Caused by [[Plateau Iris Configuration]] (anteriorly positioned ciliary processes pushing the peripheral iris forward),.

**ISGEO Classification (Natural History Based):**
This modern classification system categorizes the disease based on gonioscopy and evidence of damage,,:

| Stage | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Primary Angle Closure Suspect]] (PACS)** | Irido-trabecular contact (ITC) in >180-270°, normal IOP, no peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS), normal disc/field. |
| **[[Primary Angle Closure]] (PAC)** | ITC in >180-270° **PLUS** elevated IOP and/or PAS. Optic disc and visual fields are normal. |
| **[[Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma]] (PACG)** | PAC **PLUS** evidence of glaucomatous optic neuropathy (disc damage/visual field loss). |

**Traditional Clinical Classification (Symptom Based),:**
*   **Latent/Prodromal:** Asymptomatic or mild transient symptoms.
*   **Intermittent (Subacute):** Transient attacks of blurring and halos; self-limiting.
*   **Acute Congestive:** Sudden total angle closure with severe pain, redness, and vision loss.
*   **Chronic Angle Closure:** Creeping angle closure with variable symptoms, resembling POAG clinically but with closed angles.

#### 3. Combined Mechanism Glaucoma
Eyes with an occludable angle and some peripheral anterior synechiae, but the IOP elevation or nerve damage exceeds what is explicable by the angle closure alone (suggesting underlying trabecular damage of POAG),.

---

### IV. Congenital and Developmental Glaucomas

These result from developmental abnormalities of the angle of the anterior chamber,.

#### 1. Primary Congenital Glaucoma (PCG)
Glaucoma due to isolated trabeculodysgenesis without other ocular anomalies,. Classified by age of onset:
*   **True Congenital/Newborn Glaucoma:** Intrauterine onset; child born with ocular enlargement (40% of cases).
*   **[[Infantile Glaucoma]]:** Manifests prior to the 3rd birthday (55% of cases).
*   **[[Juvenile Glaucoma]]:** Pressure rise occurs after 3 years but before adulthood (typically 10–35 years),.

#### 2. Secondary Congenital/Developmental Glaucoma
Associated with other ocular or systemic anomalies,,:
*   **Iridocorneal Dysgenesis:** [[Axenfeld-Rieger Syndrome]], [[Peters Anomaly]], Posterior Embryotoxon.
*   **Aniridia:** 50% association with glaucoma.
*   **Phacomatoses:** [[Sturge-Weber Syndrome]], [[Neurofibromatosis]].
*   **Ectopia Lentis Syndromes:** [[Marfan Syndrome]], [[Homocystinuria]], [[Weill-Marchesani Syndrome]].
*   **Others:** [[Lowe Syndrome]], Congenital Rubella (10% cases).

### V. Secondary Glaucomas

Classification based on the primary causative factor. These can present as either Open Angle or Angle Closure types,.

#### 1. Lens-Induced (Phacogenic) Glaucoma,,
*   **[[Phacomorphic Glaucoma]]:** Secondary angle closure due to an intumescent (swollen) cataract.
*   **[[Phacolytic Glaucoma]]:** Secondary open angle; macrophages clog the meshwork due to leaked lens proteins from a hypermature cataract.
*   **[[Phacotopic Glaucoma]]:** Due to lens subluxation/dislocation blocking the pupil.
*   **Lens Particle Glaucoma:** Retained cortical matter after trauma/surgery clogging the meshwork.
*   **Phacoanaphylactic Glaucoma:** Granulomatous inflammation against lens protein.

#### 2. Inflammatory Glaucoma
*   **Uveitic Glaucoma:** Clogging by inflammatory cells (Open Angle) or synechiae formation (Angle Closure).
*   **[[Glaucomatocyclitic Crisis]] (Posner-Schlossman Syndrome):** Recurrent mild anterior uveitis with markedly high IOP.
*   **[[Fuchs Heterochromic Iridocyclitis]].**

#### 3. Neovascular Glaucoma (NVG)
*   Results from [[Rubeosis Iridis]] (neovascularization of iris) driven by retinal ischemia (e.g., [[Diabetic Retinopathy]], [[CRVO]]).
*   Initially secondary open angle (pre-trabecular membrane), later secondary angle closure (zipper-like synechiae),.

#### 4. Pigmentary Glaucoma
*   Secondary open angle glaucoma due to pigment dispersion syndrome (Krukenberg spindles, Sampaolesi line),.

#### 5. Pseudoexfoliation Glaucoma
*   Secondary open angle glaucoma due to dandruff-like exfoliative material clogging the trabecular meshwork,,.

#### 6. Traumatic Glaucoma,
*   **Angle Recession Glaucoma:** Tear in the ciliary body face.
*   **[[Ghost Cell Glaucoma]]:** Degenerated RBCs from vitreous hemorrhage blocking the meshwork.
*   **Red Cell Glaucoma:** Fresh hyphema blocking the meshwork.

#### 7. Drug-Induced
*   **[[Steroid-Induced Glaucoma]]:** Usually secondary open angle due to glycosaminoglycan deposition in the trabecular meshwork,.

#### 8. Miscellaneous
*   **[[Malignant Glaucoma]] (Ciliary Block):** Aqueous misdirection into vitreous leading to shallow anterior chamber,,.
*   **Iridocorneal Endothelial (ICE) Syndromes:** Progressive iris atrophy, Chandler’s syndrome, Cogan-Reese syndrome,.
*   **Tumor-associated:** Retinoblastoma, Melanoma.

### VI. Absolute Glaucoma

*   This is not a specific type but the **end stage** of any uncontrolled glaucoma,.
*   **Features:** Complete blindness (No PL), painful eye, high IOP, stony hard eyeball, glaucomatous optic atrophy.
