# Examination of the Spine

The clinical examination of the spine follows the classic orthopedic principle of **Look, Feel, Move**, followed by neurological assessment and special tests.

## 1. Inspection (Look)
The patient must be suitably undressed to visualize the entire spine. Examination involves observing the patient standing, walking, and lying down.

*   **General Appearance:** Note if the patient is comfortable or in pain. Observe the **[[gait]]**.
    *   **[[Alderman's gait]]**: Small steps with a straight, stiff back to avoid jarring, seen in [[Tuberculosis of the spine]].
    *   **[[Short leg gait]]**: Indicates limb length discrepancy.
*   **Posture and Deformity:**
    *   **[[Scoliosis]]**: Lateral curvature of the spine. Note if the spine is straight or curved.
    *   **[[Kyphosis]]**: Increased posterior convexity (thoracic). A sharp angulation is called a **[[gibbus]]** or **[[kyphos]]** (common in TB).
    *   **[[Lordosis]]**: Increased anterior convexity (lumbar). Loss of lumbar lordosis is a sign of [[paravertebral muscle spasm]].
    *   **[[List]] (Sciatic Tilt)**: The trunk is tilted to one side, common in [[disc prolapse]].
*   **Skin and Soft Tissues:**
    *   **[[Café-au-lait spots]]**: Suggests [[Neurofibromatosis]].
    *   **[[Faun's beard]]** (tuft of hair): Suggests [[Spina bifida]].
    *   **Scars/Sinuses**: Indications of previous surgery or infection (e.g., [[Chronic osteomyelitis]]).
    *   **[[Cold abscess]]**: fullness or swelling in paravertebral regions, lumbar triangle, or groin.

## 2. Palpation (Feel)
Palpation is performed with the patient standing or lying prone (which relaxes muscles).

*   **Tenderness:**
    *   **Local tenderness:** Over spinous processes or interspinous ligaments (indicates local pathology like fracture or infection).
    *   **Paravertebral tenderness:** Over muscles, indicates [[muscle spasm]] or strain.
    *   **[[Anvil test]]**: Percussion by fist thumping the top of the head or heels to elicit spine tenderness.
*   **Bony Anomalies:**
    *   **[[Step sign]]**: A palpable step-off between spinous processes, characteristic of **[[Spondylolisthesis]]** (usually L4 over L5).
    *   **Kyphus/Gibbus**: Palpable prominence of spinous processes (knuckle = 1 vertebra; gibbus = 2-3 vertebrae; round kyphosis = >3 vertebrae).
*   **Soft Tissue:**
    *   Check for [[paraspinal muscle spasm]] (muscles stand out and feel hard).
    *   Palpate for **[[Cold abscess]]** (fluctuant swelling).

## 3. Movements (Move)
Movements are tested in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions. Range of motion is often restricted in organic diseases.

### Cervical Spine
*   **Flexion:** "Chin to chest".
*   **Extension:** "Look at the ceiling".
*   **Lateral Flexion:** "Ear to shoulder".
*   **Rotation:** "Look over shoulder".

### Thoracolumbar Spine
*   **Flexion:** Bend forward to touch toes. (Normal: fingertips 3–4 inches from floor). Look for rounding of the back. In [[Ankylosing Spondylitis]], the spine remains flat.
*   **Extension:** Lean backward (Normal ~20–30°).
*   **Lateral Flexion:** Slide hand down the thigh (Normal ~35°).
*   **Rotation:** With pelvis stabilized (sitting), rotate trunk.

### [[Schober’s Test]] (Modified)
Used to measure lumbar flexion, specifically for **[[Ankylosing Spondylitis]]**.
*   **Method:** Mark L5 spinous process. Mark a point 10 cm above it. Ask the patient to bend forward.
*   **Result:** In a normal spine, the distance increases to more than 15 cm. In ankylosing spondylitis, the increase is less than 5 cm due to stiffness.

## 4. Special Tests for Nerve Root Tension

These tests distinguish mechanical back pain from nerve root irritation (radiculopathy).

### A. [[Straight Leg Raising Test]] (SLRT)
*   **Indication:** Tests for L5 and S1 nerve root compression (Sciatic nerve).
*   **Method:** Patient supine. Examiner passively lifts the fully extended leg.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   **0°–30°:** Slack is taken up; no pain.
    *   **30°–70°:** Nerve roots are stretched over the disc. Reproduction of radiating leg pain (**[[Sciatica]]**) indicates a positive test.
    *   **>70°:** Pain is usually articular (SI joint/hamstrings), not root tension.
*   **Clinical Note:** Pain restricted to the back is *negative* for root tension; pain must radiate below the knee.

### B. [[Lasegue's Test]]
*   **Method:** Flex the hip to 90° with the knee flexed. Then, slowly extend the knee.
*   **Positive:** Significant resistance or pain limits extension, indicating sciatic nerve stretch.

### C. [[Bragard's Sign]] (Reinforcement Test)
*   **Method:** When SLRT is positive, lower the leg slightly until pain disappears, then passively **dorsiflex the foot**.
*   **Positive:** Pain reappears. This confirms the pain is neuropathic (sciatic) and not muscular (hamstring tightness).

### D. [[Bowstring Sign]]
*   **Method:** Perform SLRT to the point of pain. Flex the knee slightly to relieve pain. Apply firm pressure in the popliteal fossa over the **[[sciatic nerve]]**.
*   **Positive:** Radicular pain recurs. This is very specific for root tension.

### E. [[Crossed Sciatic Test]] (Well Leg Raising Test)
*   **Method:** Perform SLRT on the *unaffected* (healthy) leg.
*   **Positive:** Pain is felt in the *affected* leg.
*   **Significance:** Indicates a massive or axillary disc herniation (medial to the nerve root) and carries a poor prognosis for conservative treatment.

### F. [[Femoral Nerve Stretch Test]] (Reverse SLRT)
*   **Indication:** Tests for L2, L3, and L4 nerve root compression (high lumbar disc prolapse).
*   **Method:** Patient prone. Examiner passively flexes the knee and extends the hip.
*   **Positive:** Pain felt in the anterior thigh.

### G. [[Spurling's Test]] (Foraminal Compression Test)
*   **Indication:** [[Cervical radiculopathy]].
*   **Method:** Patient extends neck and rotates head to the affected side. Examiner applies downward axial compression on the head.
*   **Positive:** Radiating pain into the ipsilateral arm.

### H. [[Shoulder Abduction Relief Sign]]
*   **Indication:** Cervical radiculopathy.
*   **Method:** Patient places hand of the affected arm on top of their head.
*   **Positive:** Relief of symptoms (decreases tension on the nerve root).

## 5. Neurological Examination

A systematic assessment of motor power, sensation, and reflexes to localize the level of the lesion.

### Cervical Spine (Upper Limb)

| Root Level | Motor (Myotome) | Reflex | Sensation (Dermatome) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **C5** | [[Deltoid]] (Abduction) | [[Biceps reflex]] | Lateral aspect of arm (Regimental badge area) |
| **C6** | [[Biceps]] (Elbow flexion), Wrist Extensors | [[Brachioradialis reflex]] | Lateral forearm, Thumb, Index finger |
| **C7** | [[Triceps]] (Elbow extension), Wrist Flexors | [[Triceps reflex]] | Middle finger |
| **C8** | Finger Flexors | - | Little & Ring fingers, Medial forearm |
| **T1** | Hand Intrinsics (Finger Abduction/Adduction) | - | Medial aspect of arm/axilla |

**Mnemonic for Arm Reflexes:** **1, 2** (S1, S2 - Ankle); **3, 4** (L3, L4 - Knee); **5, 6** (C5, C6 - Biceps); **7, 8** (C7, C8 - Triceps).

### Lumbar Spine (Lower Limb)

| Root Level | Motor (Myotome) | Reflex | Sensation (Dermatome) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **L1/L2** | [[Iliopsoas]] (Hip Flexion) | - | Groin/Upper Thigh |
| **L3** | [[Quadriceps]] (Knee Extension) | [[Knee jerk]] (L3, L4) | Anterior/Medial Thigh |
| **L4** | [[Tibialis Anterior]] (Dorsiflexion) | [[Knee jerk]] (L3, L4) | Medial Leg, Medial Foot |
| **L5** | [[Extensor Hallucis Longus]] (Big Toe Extension) | - | Lateral Thigh, Lateral Leg, Dorsum of foot |
| **S1** | [[Gastrocnemius]] (Plantar Flexion), [[Peronei]] (Eversion) | [[Ankle jerk]] | Posterior Leg, Lateral border of foot, Sole |

**Clinical Tip:**
*   Pain in front of the leg = **L4**
*   Pain in side of the leg = **L5**
*   Pain in back of the leg = **S1**

## 6. Miscellaneous Tests

### Sacroiliac Joint Tests
Used to differentiate SI joint pathology (like [[Ankylosing Spondylitis]]) from lumbar spine issues.
*   **[[Pump Handle Test]]**: Fully flex hip and knee, then force the hip into adduction.
*   **[[Gaenslen’s Test]]**: One leg flexed to chest, other leg hyperextended off the edge of the table.
*   **[[FABER Test]] (Figure of 4)**: Flexion, Abduction, External Rotation. Pain in the SI joint indicates pathology.
*   **[[Pelvic Compression Test]]**: Compressing iliac crests together or apart.

### Specific Signs
*   **[[Trendelenburg Test]]**: Tests hip abductors (L5 root/Superior gluteal nerve). Positive if pelvis drops on the unaffected side when standing on the affected leg.
*   **[[Babinski Sign]]**: Upper Motor Neuron lesion check (Spinal cord compression).
*   **[[Bulbocavernous Reflex]]**: Squeeze glans penis/clitoris → anal sphincter contraction. Absence indicates **[[spinal shock]]**. Return indicates end of spinal shock; if paralysis persists after return, prognosis is poor.
