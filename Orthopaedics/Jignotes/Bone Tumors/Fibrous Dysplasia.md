# [[Bone Tumors]] > Fibrous Dysplasia

### Fibrous Dysplasia

**Fibrous Dysplasia** is a developmental anomaly (hamartoma) of the bone where normal [[lamellar bone]] fails to produce and is replaced by immature [[woven bone]] and fibrous tissue. It is caused by a somatic mutation in the **GNAS1 gene**.

#### Classification
1.  **Monostotic (80%):** Involvement of a single bone. Most commonly affects the [[femur]], [[tibia]], or [[ribs]].
2.  **Polyostotic (20%):** Involvement of multiple bones. Often unilateral and associated with syndromes.

#### Associated Syndromes

| Syndrome | Components |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[McCune-Albright Syndrome]]** | 1. **Polyostotic Fibrous Dysplasia**<br>2. **Café-au-lait spots** (coast of Maine appearance)<br>3. **Endocrine hyperfunction** (Precocious puberty, hyperthyroidism) |
| **[[Mazabraud Syndrome]]** | 1. **Polyostotic Fibrous Dysplasia**<br>2. **Intramuscular myxomas** (soft tissue tumors) |

**Clinical Implications:**
*   **McCune-Albright Syndrome** is more common in females and usually presents with precocious puberty.
*   **Café-au-lait spots**: In fibrous dysplasia, the borders are irregular ("Coast of Maine"), unlike Neurofibromatosis where borders are smooth ("Coast of California").

---

#### Pathology
*   **Gross:** The lesion contains gritty, white or greyish fibrous tissue replacing the medullary cavity.
*   **Microscopy (Histology):**
    *   Irregular trabeculae of **immature [[woven bone]]** scattered within a cellular fibrous stroma.
    *   **Appearance:** Described as **"Chinese letter pattern"** or **"Alphabet soup"** appearance.
    *   **Key Feature:** The bone trabeculae **lack osteoblastic rimming** (distinguishing it from [[osteoid osteoma]] or [[osteoblastoma]]).

---

#### Clinical Features
*   **Age:** Usually presents in the 1st to 3rd decade (Children and young adults).
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Often asymptomatic (incidental finding).
    *   Pain, swelling, or limp.
    *   **[[Pathological fracture]]:** Often the presenting event due to weakened bone structure.
*   **Deformity:** Bending of weight-bearing bones due to bone softening.

### Shepherd's Crook Deformity
This is the classic, pathognomonic deformity associated with Fibrous Dysplasia involving the [[proximal femur]].

*   **Pathomechanics:** The replacement of strong cortical bone with weak fibrous tissue in the femoral neck and proximal shaft leads to microfractures and plastic deformation under weight-bearing stress.
*   **Appearance:**
    *   Severe **varus deformity** of the proximal femur.
    *   The femur resembles a shepherd’s staff (crook).
*   **Consequences:**
    *   Significant limb shortening.
    *   Limping (Trendelenburg gait).
    *   High risk of pathological fracture.

#### Radiological Features (X-ray)
*   **Site:** Diaphysis or Metaphysis.
*   **Appearance:** **[[Ground-glass appearance]]** (hazy, milky, or smoky appearance due to loss of normal trabecular pattern).
*   **Expansion:** The bone may appear expanded with cortical thinning.
*   **Sign:** **RIND Sign** (Ring sign) may be seen.
*   **Deformity:** **Shepherd’s Crook deformity** in the proximal femur.

#### Treatment
The condition often stabilizes after skeletal maturity. Malignant transformation (to [[osteosarcoma]] or [[fibrosarcoma]]) is rare (<1%) but possible.

**1. Conservative Management**
*   Indicated for asymptomatic, small lesions.
*   **Medical Therapy:** **[[Bisphosphonates]]** (e.g., [[Pamidronate]], [[Zoledronate]]) are used to reduce bone pain and decrease the rate of bone resorption.

**2. Surgical Management**
*   **Indications:**
    *   Significant pain or increasing deformity.
    *   Pathological fractures.
    *   Shepherd's Crook deformity interfering with function.
*   **Procedures:**
    *   **Curettage and Bone Grafting:** High recurrence rate with simple curettage; cortical bone grafts are preferred.
    *   **Osteotomy:** specifically **Valgus [[osteotomy]]** to correct the Shepherd's crook (varus) deformity.
    *   **Internal Fixation:** Intramedullary devices (nails) are generally preferred over plates for femoral lesions to provide load-sharing support and prevent refracture.
