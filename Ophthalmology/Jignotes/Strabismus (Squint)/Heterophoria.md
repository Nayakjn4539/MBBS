### Heterophoria (Latent Squint)

**Definition**
[[Heterophoria]] (Latent Squint) is a condition in which there is a tendency for the eyes to deviate, but this deviation is kept latent (hidden) by the mechanism of [[Fusion]] or [[Binocular Single Vision]],,.
*   When the influence of fusion is removed (e.g., by covering one eye), the visual axis of one eye deviates.
*   It is distinguished from [[Heterotropia]] (Manifest Squint), where the deviation is visible even with both eyes open, and from [[Orthophoria]], which is a theoretical state of perfect alignment without any tendency to deviate,.

**Clinical Implication:** A small amount of heterophoria is almost universal and is termed **Physiological Heterophoria**. It only becomes pathological ("Decompensated Heterophoria") when it gives rise to symptoms.

### Classification

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Esophoria]]** | Tendency of the eyes to deviate inward (converge),. |
| **[[Exophoria]]** | Tendency of the eyes to deviate outward (diverge),. |
| **[[Hyperphoria]]** | Tendency of one eye to deviate upwards relative to the other (e.g., Right Hyperphoria),. |
| **[[Hypophoria]]** | Tendency of one eye to deviate downwards (usually described as Hyperphoria of the other eye),. |
| **[[Cyclophoria]]** | Tendency of the eye to rotate around the anteroposterior axis. <br> • **Incyclophoria:** 12 o'clock meridian rotates nasally.<br> • **Excyclophoria:** 12 o'clock meridian rotates temporally,. |

**Sub-classification of Horizontal Phorias:**,
*   **Convergence Excess:** Esophoria greater for near than distance.
*   **Divergence Weakness:** Esophoria greater for distance than near.
*   **Convergence Insufficiency:** Exophoria greater for near than distance (Common).
*   **Divergence Excess:** Exophoria greater for distance than near.

### Etiology

1.  **Refractive Errors:**
    *   **[[Hypermetropia]]:** Often associated with [[Esophoria]] due to the need for excessive accommodation, which stimulates excessive accommodative convergence,.
    *   **[[Myopia]]:** Often associated with [[Exophoria]] because myopes require less accommodation for near work, leading to under-stimulation of convergence,.
2.  **Anatomical Factors:**
    *   Abnormal [[Interpupillary Distance]] (IPD): Wide IPD predisposes to exophoria; small IPD to esophoria.
    *   Orbital asymmetry or muscle insertion anomalies.
3.  **Physiological/Occupational Factors:**
    *   **Dissociation:** Prolonged use of one eye (e.g., microscopists, watchmakers) can lead to exophoria.
    *   **Age:** Advancing age weakens convergence.
    *   **General Health:** Debility, fatigue, and psychoneurosis can lead to decompensation.

### Clinical Features

Patients are divided into two groups:
1.  **Compensated Heterophoria:** Asymptomatic. The fusional reserve is sufficient to overcome the deviation.
2.  **Decompensated Heterophoria:** Symptomatic due to muscle fatigue from continuous use of reserve neuromuscular power.

**Symptoms of Decompensated Phoria:**,
*   **[[Asthenopia]] (Eye Strain):** Tiredness, brow ache, and headache, typically after prolonged use of eyes (e.g., reading, computer work).
*   **Blurring of Vision:** Intermittent blurring due to relaxation of accommodation/convergence.
*   **Intermittent [[Diplopia]]:** Double vision occurs when fusion breaks down under stress or fatigue.
*   **Difficulty in Depth Perception:** Problems judging distances, especially for moving objects (e.g., ball games, pilots landing aircraft).
*   **Crowding:** Words appearing to run together.

### Diagnosis and Investigations

#### 1. Visual Acuity and Refraction
To rule out uncorrected refractive errors causing the phoria.

#### 2. Cover-Uncover Test
This is essential to differentiate between a Tropia (manifest squint) and a Phoria.
*   **Cover Test:** Covers the fixing eye to check for manifest squint (Tropia).
*   **Uncover Test:** Detects **Phoria**.
    *   **Method:** Cover one eye (breaking fusion), causing it to deviate to its latent position. When the cover is removed, the eye moves *back* to regain fixation,.
    *   **Interpretation:**
        *   Eye moves **Inwards** on uncovering $\rightarrow$ Deviation was Outward $\rightarrow$ **[[Exophoria]]**.
        *   Eye moves **Outwards** on uncovering $\rightarrow$ Deviation was Inward $\rightarrow$ **[[Esophoria]]**.

**Mnemonic:** **DOOM** – **D**eviation **O**pposite **O**f **M**ovement (On uncover test).

#### 3. Maddox Rod Test (For Distance)
*   **Instrument:** A disc of red glass rods that converts a point of light into a red line streak,.
*   **Procedure:** Patient views a spot of light at 6m. [[Maddox Rod]] is placed before the right eye.
*   **Result (if rods are horizontal, creating a vertical red line):**
    *   Line passes through the light: **Orthophoria**.
    *   Line and Light are on same side (Uncrossed): **Esophoria**.
    *   Line and Light are on opposite sides (Crossed): **Exophoria**.
*   **Measurement:** Prisms are placed in front of the eye to superimpose the line and light. The prism power required indicates the degree of phoria.

#### 4. Maddox Wing Test (For Near)
*   **Instrument:** Hand-held device used at 33 cm. Separation of fields is achieved by a diaphragm (septum),.
*   **Mechanism:** Right eye sees white/red arrows; Left eye sees horizontal/vertical rows of numbers.
*   **Measurement:** The patient reads the number the arrow points to. This measures:
    *   Horizontal Phoria (White arrow/Horizontal numbers).
    *   Vertical Phoria (Red arrow/Vertical numbers).
    *   Cyclophoria (Adjustable torsion lever),.

#### 5. Measurement of Fusional Reserves
*   **Prism Bar Fusion Range:** Measures the amplitude of fusion (Positive and Negative Fusional Vergence).
*   **[[Synoptophore]]:** Assessing subjective and objective angles and fusional capacity.
*   **[[RAF Ruler]]:** Measures Near Point of Convergence (NPC) and Near Point of Accommodation (NPA). Normal NPC is <10 cm,.

### Treatment

Treatment is indicated **only** if the heterophoria is symptomatic (decompensated).

#### 1. Optical Correction (Refraction)
*   Correction of refractive errors is the first line of management.
*   **[[Hypermetropia]]:** Full correction can relieve **Esophoria** (by relaxing accommodation).
*   **[[Myopia]]:** Correction aids **Exophoria** (by stimulating accommodation and convergence).

#### 2. Orthoptics (Vision Therapy)
*   Aim: To improve fusional reserves and convert decompensated phoria into compensated phoria,.
*   **Convergence Insufficiency:** Treated with convergence exercises (e.g., Pencil Push-ups, Stereograms, Synoptophore).
*   **Prism Exercises:** To strengthen weak muscles.

#### 3. Prism Prescription
*   Used if symptoms persist despite refraction and exercises.
*   **Relieving Prisms:** Placed with the **base opposite** to the deviation (e.g., Base-In for Exophoria, Base-Out for Esophoria),.
*   *Note:* Prisms correct the symptoms but not the underlying deviation. Usually, only 1/2 to 2/3 of the phoria is corrected.

#### 4. Surgical Treatment
*   Indicated only for large, symptomatic deviations not responding to non-surgical measures.
*   Procedures involve strengthening (resection) or weakening (recession) of extraocular muscles, similar to manifest squint surgery.
