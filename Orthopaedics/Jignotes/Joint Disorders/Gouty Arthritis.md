# Gouty Arthritis (Podagra and Tophi)

### Definition and Overview
[[Gout]] is a metabolic disorder of **purine metabolism** characterized by **hyperuricemia** and the deposition of **[[monosodium urate]] (MSU) crystals** in joints and soft tissues. It typically presents as a recurrent, acute inflammatory arthritis, which may progress to a chronic deforming condition with the formation of [[tophi]].

### Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Gout is primarily a disease of adult males (middle-aged) and post-menopausal women.
*   **Mnemonic for Risk Factors:** Gout is a disease of **A-B-O-D**:
    *   **A**ffluence / **A**lcoholism
    *   **B**lood pressure (Hypertension)
    *   **O**besity
    *   **D**iuretic treatment / **D**iet (Red meat)

### Pathogenesis
1.  **Hyperuricemia:** Increased serum uric acid levels (Normal: < 7 mg/dL in males) due to either overproduction or underexcretion (renal impairment) of uric acid.
2.  **Crystal Precipitation:** Sudden fluctuations in uric acid levels cause MSU crystals to precipitate, particularly in **cold peripheral joints** (e.g., the big toe).
3.  **Inflammatory Response:** Crystals deposited in connective tissue (cartilage, synovium) are usually inert. However, trauma or dietary triggers disperse these needle-like crystals into the joint, triggering an acute inflammatory reaction involving neutrophils.

### Clinical Presentation

#### 1. Acute Gouty Arthritis (Podagra)
*   **Onset:** Sudden, rapid onset, often waking the patient at night or early morning.
*   **Site:** The **1st Metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint** of the great toe is the most common site (known as **[[Podagra]]**). Other sites include the ankle, knee, wrist, and elbow.
*   **Signs:**
    *   The joint becomes **Red, Hot, Swollen, and Tender** (resembling a [[septic arthritis]] or [[cellulitis]]).
    *   Exquisite tenderness (even the weight of a bedsheet is intolerable).
    *   Systemic features: Fever, leukocytosis, and raised ESR.
*   **Duration:** Untreated attacks usually resolve spontaneously in 5–10 days.

**Mnemonic for Clinical Features (FRAME):**
*   **F**irst MTP joint involved (Podagra)
*   **R**ed hot joint
*   **A**rticular involvement usually single (Monoarticular)
*   **M**any urate crystals within neutrophils
*   **E**xtreme pain

#### 2. Chronic Tophaceous Gout
Occurs after years of recurrent acute attacks.
*   **[[Tophi]]:** Large clumps/nodules of chalky urate deposits in soft tissues.
*   **Common Sites for Tophi:**
    *   Around the 1st MTP joint (Big toe).
    *   [[Achilles tendon]].
    *   [[Olecranon bursa]].
    *   Pinna of the ear (helix/antihelix).
    *   Finger pulps.
*   **Complications:** Tophi may ulcerate through the skin discharging chalky white material (urates), leading to secondary infection. Joint erosion causes stiffness and deformity.

**Clinical Implication:** Do not mistake a tophus for an abscess and incise it indiscriminately; the chalky discharge is diagnostic.

### Investigations

#### 1. Synovial Fluid Analysis (Gold Standard)
*   Aspiration of the joint is the definitive diagnostic test.
*   **Findings:** Presence of **needle-shaped**, **negatively birefringent** [[monosodium urate crystals]] viewed under polarized light microscopy. The crystals are typically intracellular (within neutrophils).

#### 2. Serum Uric Acid
*    usually elevated (**Hyperuricemia**).
*   **Note:** Serum uric acid levels may be **normal** during an acute attack; therefore, a normal level does not exclude gout.

#### 3. Radiology (X-rays)
*   **Acute Stage:** Shows only soft tissue swelling.
*   **Chronic Stage:**
    *   **Punched-out lesions:** Lytic lesions in the periarticular bone (para-articular erosions).
    *   **Martel’s Sign (Overhanging Margins):** A thin shell of cortical bone hanging over the tophus/erosion.
    *   Joint space is generally preserved until late stages (unlike [[Osteoarthritis]] or [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]]).
    *   No periarticular osteopenia (unlike RA).

#### 4. Renal Function Tests
*   To assess for urate nephropathy or renal calculi.

### Differential Diagnosis
1.  **[[Septic Arthritis]]:** Must be ruled out in any acute hot, red joint. Aspiration is key.
2.  **[[Pseudogout]] (CPPD):** Caused by Calcium Pyrophosphate Dihydrate crystals. Crystals are rhomboid and positively birefringent. Commonly affects the knee.
3.  **[[Cellulitis]]:** Superficial skin infection.
4.  **[[Rheumatoid Arthritis]]:** Polyarticular gout may mimic RA, but RA typically involves the hands/wrists symmetrically and causes morning stiffness.
5.  **[[Hallux Valgus]] (Bunion):** Deformity of the big toe.

### Management

#### 1. Treatment of Acute Attack
**Goal:** Relieve pain and inflammation immediately.
*   **Rest & Elevation:** Rest the joint; apply ice packs.
*   **NSAIDs:** **[[Indomethacin]]** is the drug of choice. Full doses are given until pain subsides. (Avoid Aspirin as it inhibits uric acid excretion).
*   **[[Colchicine]]:** Effective for acute pain but has significant gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, diarrhea).
*   **Corticosteroids:** Intra-articular injection (if septic arthritis is excluded) or systemic steroids if NSAIDs/Colchicine are contraindicated.

**Clinical Implication:** **DO NOT** start urate-lowering drugs (like Allopurinol) during an acute attack. Sudden lowering of serum uric acid can mobilize more crystals and worsen/prolong the attack. If the patient is *already* on them, continue at the same dose.

#### 2. Treatment of Chronic Gout (Prophylaxis)
**Goal:** Prevent recurrences and dissolve tophi by lowering serum uric acid.
*   **Lifestyle Modification:**
    *   Weight reduction.
    *   Low purine diet (avoid red meat, organ meats, shellfish).
    *   Avoid alcohol (especially beer).
    *   High fluid intake (to prevent renal stones).
*   **Pharmacotherapy (Urate-Lowering Therapy):**
    *   **Xanthine Oxidase Inhibitors:** **[[Allopurinol]]** (Standard therapy) or **[[Febuxostat]]**. They inhibit uric acid production.
    *   **Uricosuric Agents:** **[[Probenecid]]** or Sulfinpyrazone. Increase renal excretion of uric acid. (Contraindicated in patients with renal stones).

#### 3. Surgical Management
*   **Excision of Tophi:** If they are cosmetically unsightly, causing mechanical block, or ulcerating/infected.
*   **Arthrodesis/Arthroplasty:** For severely destroyed joints (rarely needed).
