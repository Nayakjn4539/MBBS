# STAGES OF DEMOGRAPHIC CYCLE

The demographic cycle represents the journey of a nation's population growth history, typically divided into 5 stages based on the trends of [[Birth Rate]] and [[Death Rate]].

### 1. First Stage: High Stationary
*   **Characteristics:** Characterized by a **High Birth Rate** and a **High Death Rate**.
*   **Result:** These two rates cancel each other out, resulting in a **Stationary Population** (No growth).
*   **Example:** India was in this stage until 1920.
*   **Reason:** Lack of development, epidemics, and food shortages kept mortality high, balancing high fertility.

### 2. Second Stage: Early Expanding
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   The **Death Rate begins to decline**.
    *   The **Birth Rate remains unchanged** (stays high).
*   **Result:** The population begins to grow rapidly (**Population Explosion** begins).
*   **Reason:** Improvements in health conditions, sanitation, and food supply reduce mortality, but fertility behavior takes longer to change.
*   **Example:** Many countries in South Asia and Africa.

### 3. Third Stage: Late Expanding
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   The **Death Rate declines still further**.
    *   The **Birth Rate begins to fall** (tends to decline).
*   **Result:** The population **continues to grow** because births still exceed deaths. The gap between birth and death rates is known as the [[Demographic Gap]].
*   **Current Status:** **[[India]]** has entered this phase.
*   **Trend:** In developing countries like China and Singapore, birth rates have declined rapidly in this phase.

### 4. Fourth Stage: Low Stationary
*   **Characteristics:** Characterized by a **Low Birth Rate** and a **Low Death Rate**.
*   **Result:** The population becomes **Stationary** (Zero population growth).
*   **Example:** Most industrialized countries like UK, Denmark, Sweden, Belgium, and Austria.

### 5. Fifth Stage: Declining
*   **Characteristics:** The **Birth Rate falls lower** than the Death Rate.
*   **Result:** The population begins to **Decline**.
*   **Example:** East European countries like Germany and Hungary.
*   **Note:** This stage leads to a "Demographic Liability" (higher number of older dependent population).

### Summary Table: Stages of Demographic Cycle

| Stage | Name | Birth Rate (BR) | Death Rate (DR) | Demographic Gap | Population Change | Age Pyramid Shape |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I** | **High Stationary** | High | High | Narrow | Stationary | Pyramidal |
| **II** | **Early Expanding** | High | Declining | **Increasing** | Rapid Growth | Broad Base |
| **III** | **Late Expanding** | Declining | Declining | **Decreasing** | Growing | Globular |
| **IV** | **Low Stationary** | Low | Low | Narrow | Stationary | Cylindrical |
| **V** | **Declining** | Very Low | Low | Negative | **Declining** | Losing cylindrical shape |

### Clinical & Public Health Relevance

*   **India's Position:** India is currently in the **Late Expanding (Third)** stage.
*   **Demographic Gap:** The difference between the birth rate and the death rate. A wide gap leads to population explosion, typically maximizing in late Stage II.
*   **Demographic Dividend/Gift:** Occurs primarily in Stage III and IV where there is a higher number of economically productive population and a lower dependency ratio due to higher birth rates in the previous stage.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a line graph with X-axis as Time and Y-axis as Rate per 1000. Plot two lines: one for Birth Rate (Solid) and one for Death Rate (Dotted). 
> - Stage 1: Both lines are high and wavy.
> - Stage 2: DR line drops sharply; BR stays high (Gap opens).
> - Stage 3: BR line starts dropping; DR drops slowly (Gap narrows but persists).
> - Stage 4: Both lines are low and wavy.
> - Stage 5: BR line drops below DR line.

### Mnemonic
To remember the sequence of the 5 stages:
**"H**igh **E**nergy **L**evels **L**ower **D**isease"

*   **H**igh Stationary
*   **E**arly Expanding
*   **L**ate Expanding
*   **L**ow Stationary
*   **D**eclining
