# Cervical Spondylosis and Radiculopathy

### Definition and Introduction
**[[Cervical Spondylosis]]** is a chronic degenerative condition of the cervical spine that affects the **[[Intervertebral Disc]]**, vertebral bodies, and associated joints. It is a natural concomitant of aging, occurring in over 80% of people over 50 years of age.

While often asymptomatic, the degenerative changes can lead to compression of the **[[Spinal Nerve Root]]** (Radiculopathy) or the **[[Spinal Cord]]** (Myelopathy).

---

### Etiopathogenesis
The condition initiates in the intervertebral disc and triggers a cascade of degenerative changes:
1.  **Disc Degeneration:** The **[[Nucleus Pulposus]]** loses hydration and becomes desiccated. The **[[Annulus Fibrosus]]** develops fissures and loses elasticity.
2.  **Loss of Disc Height:** As the disc collapses, the intervertebral space narrows.
3.  **Instability and Osteophyte Formation:** The abnormal stress on the vertebral margins leads to reactive new bone formation, creating bony spurs known as **[[Osteophytes]]**.
4.  **Foraminal Stenosis:** Osteophytes, particularly those projecting posteriorly and laterally, encroach upon the **[[Intervertebral Foramen]]**, compressing the exiting nerve roots.
5.  **Secondary Changes:** Hypertrophy of the **[[Ligamentum Flavum]]** and degeneration of the **[[Facet Joint]]** (facet arthropathy) further compromise the spinal canal diameter.

**Common Levels Affected:**
*   **C5–C6** (Most common).
*   **C6–C7** (Second most common).

### Clinical Features
Symptoms often develop gradually but can be precipitated by minor trauma.

#### 1. Symptoms
*   **Neck Pain:** Usually dull and aching, felt in the neck and often referred to the **[[Occiput]]**, **[[Scapula]]**, or shoulders.
*   **Stiffness:** Worse in the morning, improving with mild activity.
*   **[[Radiculopathy]] (Root Pain):** Shooting or burning pain radiating down the arm, forearm, and hand in a dermatomal distribution. It may be associated with **[[Paraesthesia]]** (pins and needles) and numbness.
*   **Vertebrobasilar Insufficiency:** Occasionally, osteophytes may compress the **[[Vertebral Artery]]** in the foramen transversarium, causing vertigo, tinnitus, or syncopal attacks (giddiness) upon neck extension or rotation.

#### 2. Physical Signs
*   **Look:** Loss of normal cervical **[[Lordosis]]** (straightening of the spine).
*   **Feel:** Tenderness over the paraspinal muscles and spinous processes. Trigger points may be present in the trapezius or scapular region.
*   **Move:** Range of motion is restricted, particularly extension and lateral flexion. Movement may be associated with crepitus.

#### 3. Special Tests
*   **[[Spurling’s Test]] (Foraminal Compression Test):** The patient extends the neck and rotates the chin to the affected side while the examiner applies downward pressure on the head. A positive test reproduces radicular pain/paraesthesia in the arm, confirming nerve root compression.
*   **Abduction Relief Sign:** Placing the hand of the affected arm overhead relieves the radicular pain by reducing tension on the nerve root.

### Neurological Assessment (Radiculopathy)
A systematic neurological examination identifies the specific level of nerve root compression.

| Nerve Root | Disc Level | Motor Weakness (Myotome) | Sensory Loss (Dermatome) | Reflex Loss |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[C5 Nerve Root]]** | C4–C5 | **[[Deltoid]]** (Shoulder abduction), **[[Biceps Brachii]]** | Lateral aspect of upper arm (regimental badge area) | **[[Biceps Reflex]]** |
| **[[C6 Nerve Root]]** | C5–C6 | **[[Biceps Brachii]]**, **[[Extensor Carpi Radialis Longus]]** (Wrist extension) | Lateral forearm, **[[Thumb]]**, Index finger | **[[Biceps Reflex]]**, **[[Brachioradialis Reflex]]** |
| **[[C7 Nerve Root]]** | C6–C7 | **[[Triceps Brachii]]** (Elbow extension), Wrist flexors | Middle finger | **[[Triceps Reflex]]** |
| **[[C8 Nerve Root]]** | C7–T1 | Finger flexors, Hand intrinsics | Medial forearm, Ring and Little finger | None (Finger flexion reflex) |
| **[[T1 Nerve Root]]** | T1–T2 | Finger abduction (Interossei) | Medial side of upper arm | None |

> **Clinical Implication:** Do not confuse the vertebral level with the nerve root level. In the cervical spine, the C6 nerve root exits *above* the C6 vertebra (at the C5–C6 disc level).

### Investigations

#### 1. X-Rays (Cervical Spine AP, Lateral, Oblique)
Radiographs are standard for initial assessment.
*   **Loss of Lordosis:** Straightening of the spine due to spasm.
*   **Disc Space Narrowing:** Reduced height between vertebral bodies.
*   **[[Osteophytes]] (Spurs):** Seen at the anterior and posterior margins of vertebral bodies.
*   **Foraminal Stenosis:** Oblique views visualize the encroachment of osteophytes into the intervertebral foramina.

#### 2. Magnetic Resonance Imaging ([[MRI]])
*   **Gold Standard** for visualizing soft tissues.
*   Clearly demonstrates **[[Intervertebral Disc Herniation]]**, nerve root compression, and spinal cord status (myelomalacia).

#### 3. Neurophysiological Studies
*   **[[Electromyography]] (EMG)** and **[[Nerve Conduction Study]]**: Useful to distinguish cervical radiculopathy from peripheral nerve entrapments (e.g., Carpal Tunnel Syndrome) or brachial plexopathy.

---

### Differential Diagnosis
1.  **[[Prolapsed Intervertebral Disc]] (Acute):** Sudden onset, usually in younger patients.
2.  **[[Rotator Cuff]] Pathology:** Shoulder pain aggravated by abduction; normal neck exam.
3.  **Peripheral Entrapment Neuropathies:** e.g., [[Carpal Tunnel Syndrome]], [[Cubital Tunnel Syndrome]].
4.  **[[Pancoast Tumor]]**: Apical lung tumor causing C8/T1 pain and Horner’s syndrome.
5.  **[[Cervical Rib]]**: Thoracic outlet symptoms.

### Management

#### 1. Conservative Management
Most patients respond to non-operative treatment.
*   **Rest and Immobilization:** A soft **[[Cervical Collar]]** helps restrict movement and relieve muscle spasm during acute episodes.
*   **Medication:**
    *   **[[Analgesics]]** (Paracetamol, Tramadol) and **[[NSAIDs]]** (Ibuprofen, Diclofenac) for pain and inflammation.
    *   **Muscle Relaxants** for paraspinal spasm.
    *   **Pregabalin/Gabapentin** for neuropathic radicular pain.
*   **Physiotherapy:**
    *   **Intermittent [[Cervical Traction]]**: Enlarges the neural foramen and relieves root pressure.
    *   **Isometric Exercises:** To strengthen neck muscles once acute pain subsides.
    *   Heat therapy/Short-wave diathermy.

#### 2. Surgical Management
Surgery is indicated in <5% of cases.

**Indications:**
*   Severe, unremitting pain failing conservative therapy.
*   Progressive neurological deficit (motor weakness).
*   Signs of **[[Cervical Myelopathy]]** (cord compression).

**Procedures:**
1.  **[[Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion]] (ACDF):**
    *   The standard procedure for central or paracentral disc prolapse.
    *   Removal of the disc and osteophytes from the front.
    *   Insertion of a **[[Bone Graft]]** (iliac crest) or synthetic cage to restore height and fuse the segment.
2.  **[[Foraminotomy]] (Posterior Approach):**
    *   Used for purely lateral nerve root compression.
    *   Removal of part of the facet joint/lamina to decompress the root without fusion.
3.  **[[Disc Replacement]] (Arthroplasty):**
    *   Artificial disc insertion to preserve motion and prevent adjacent segment disease.
