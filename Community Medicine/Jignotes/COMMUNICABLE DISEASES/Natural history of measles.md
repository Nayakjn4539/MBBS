# Natural History of Measles

[[Measles]] (Rubeola) is an acute, highly infectious viral disease of childhood characterized by fever, catarrhal symptoms, and a typical rash. It is known as the "First Disease" among the six classic exanthems of childhood.

### 1. Epidemiological Determinants

**A. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** Caused by an **RNA Paramyxovirus** (Genus: Morbillivirus).
    *   There is only **one serotype** of the measles virus.
*   **Source of Infection:** A clinical case of measles is the only source. **Carriers are not known to occur**,.
*   **Infective Material:** Secretions of the nose, throat, and respiratory tract of a case during the prodromal period and early stages of rash.
*   **Period of Communicability:** Highly infectious. It ranges from **4 days before to 5 days after** the appearance of the rash.
    *   *Secondary Attack Rate:* >80% (Very high).

**B. Host Factors**
*   **Age:** Affects virtually everyone in infancy or childhood. In developing countries, it commonly attacks children between **6 months and 3 years** of age.
    *   *Immunity:* Infants are protected by maternal antibodies up to 6 months of age. One attack of measles generally confers **life-long immunity**.
*   **Nutrition:** Measles is often known as a disease of poverty. It is very severe in malnourished children (especially those with [[Vitamin A Deficiency]]). Mortality can be up to 400 times higher in children with **Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM)**.

**C. Environmental Factors**
*   **Season:** In temperate climates, it is a winter disease. In tropical zones, most cases occur during the **dry season**.
*   **Transmission:** Direct person-to-person spread mainly by **droplet infection** and droplet nuclei.
    *   *Portal of Entry:* Respiratory tract and conjunctiva.

### 2. Stages of Pathogenesis

The incubation period is commonly **10 days** from exposure to the onset of fever, and **14 days** to the appearance of the rash. The clinical course is divided into three distinct stages:

#### I. Prodromal Stage (Pre-eruptive Stage)
*   **Duration:** Begins 10 days after infection and lasts until day 14.
*   **Symptoms:** Characterized by the **3 C's**: **C**ough, **C**oryza, and **C**onjunctivitis (red eyes/photophobia) along with fever.
*   **Pathognomonic Sign:** [[Koplik's Spots]].
    *   Small, bluish-white spots on a red base (resembling table salt crystals).
    *   Location: Buccal mucosa opposite the first and second lower molars.
    *   Appearance: A day or two *before* the rash appears.

#### II. Eruptive Phase
*   **Rash Appearance:** Typical dusky-red, **maculo-papular rash**.
*   **Progression:**
    1.  Begins **behind the ears** (retro-auricular) and near the hairline.
    2.  Spreads rapidly to the face and neck within a few hours.
    3.  Extends down the body to the trunk and extremities over 2–3 days.
*   **Disappearance:** The rash fades in the **same order** of appearance, leaving a brownish discoloration.
*   *Note:* With the appearance of the rash, the fever usually falls and viremia disappears.

#### III. Post-Measles Stage
*   The child loses weight and remains weak for several days.
*   There is a transient loss of cell-mediated immunity (anergy), making the child susceptible to other infections like tuberculosis and candidiasis.
*   Other effects include growth retardation and measles-associated diarrhea.

### 3. Complications

Complications occur in approximately 30% of cases, more frequently in children under 5 years and malnourished individuals.

| System Involved | Complication | Clinical Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Respiratory** | **Otitis Media** | **Most common** complication in young children. |
| | Pneumonia | **Most common cause of death** in measles. Can be Giant cell pneumonia. |
| | Laryngotracheobronchitis | Also known as Croup. |
| **Gastrointestinal** | Diarrhea | Very common; can lead to malnutrition. |
| **Neurological** | Febrile Convulsions | Common in young children. |
| | Encephalitis | Occurs in 1 per 1000–2000 cases. |
| | [[SSPE]] | **Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis**. A rare, fatal, late complication developing 7–10 years after infection. |
| **Ocular** | Keratomalacia | Due to Vitamin A deficiency; can lead to blindness. |

### 4. Prevention and Clinical Management

*   **Vaccination:** Live attenuated vaccine.
    *   **Dose/Route:** 0.5 ml Subcutaneous.
    *   **Schedule:** At **9 months** of age (or 9-12 months).
    *   **Vitamin A:** All cases of measles must be administered Vitamin A to prevent blindness.
        *   *< 6 months:* 50,000 IU
        *   *6-12 months:* 100,000 IU
        *   *> 1 year:* 200,000 IU.
*   **Isolation:** Recommended for **7 days** after the onset of rash.

### Summary Mnemonic

To remember the progression and features of Measles: **"MEASLES"**

*   **M** - **M**outh spots ([[Koplik's spots]]) / **M**aculopapular rash
*   **E** - **E**yes red (Conjunctivitis) / **E**ars (Rash starts behind ears)
*   **A** - **A**ge (6 months - 3 years common)
*   **S** - **S**erious complication (**S**SPE)
*   **L** - **L**ife-long immunity
*   **E** - **E**xanthema (Rash)
*   **S** - **S**ecretions are infective
