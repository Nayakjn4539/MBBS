# [[Corrosive Poisons]] > Caustic Alkalis

### Caustic Alkalis

**Caustic alkalis** act as powerful [[Corrosive Poisons]]. Unlike mineral acids which produce coagulation necrosis and form a protective eschar preventing deep penetration, alkalis produce **liquefaction necrosis**, allowing the chemical to penetrate deeply into tissues.

#### Classification and Common Sources

| Compound | Common Name | Uses/Sources |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sodium Hydroxide** | Caustic soda, Lye | Drain cleaners, oven cleaners, soap making |
| **Potassium Hydroxide** | Caustic potash | Drain cleaners, hearing aid batteries, paint removers |
| **Sodium Carbonate** | Washing soda | Household cleaners, detergents |
| **Ammonium Hydroxide** | Ammonia | Floor cleaners, refrigerants, jewelry cleaners, fertilizers |
| **Calcium Hydroxide** | Slaked lime | Cement, mortar, whitewashing |

#### Mode of Action
The mechanism of tissue injury is **Liquefaction Necrosis**.
*   **Saponification:** Alkalis react with fats in the cell membrane to form soaps.
*   **Solubilization:** They dissolve proteins, leading to proteinates.
*   **Deep Penetration:** Because the necrotic tissue (slough) is soft and moist, it does not form a barrier. The alkali continues to penetrate deeper layers until the hydroxyl ions are consumed.
*   **Site Specificity:** Alkalis affect the **oesophagus** more severely than the stomach (squamous epithelium is less resistant to alkalis). Acids, in contrast, damage the stomach more.

#### Clinical Features
**1. Gastrointestinal Tract (Ingestion)**
*   **Immediate Pain:** Burning sensation in the mouth, throat, retrosternal region, and epigastrium.
*   **Corrosion:** Mucosa appears greyish-white, boggy, and edematous. Later, it may turn brown/black due to the formation of **alkali hematin**.
*   **Vomiting:** Vomitus is alkaline, slimy/mucoid, and may contain blood (brownish/coffee-ground) and shredded necrotic tissue.
*   **Dysphagia and Drooling:** Due to severe pain and inability to swallow.
*   **Diarrhea:** With tenesmus; stools may contain blood/mucus.

**2. Respiratory System (Especially with Ammonia)**
*   Inhalation of fumes causes laryngeal edema, coughing, choking, and dyspnea.
*   Severe cases may lead to pulmonary edema or chemical pneumonitis.

**3. Ocular Exposure**
*   Splash injuries constitute an ophthalmologic emergency.
*   Deep penetration can cause corneal opacity, perforation, and permanent blindness (symblepharon formation).

**4. Late Complications**
*   **[[Oesophageal Stricture]]:** Very common sequela due to deep ulceration and subsequent fibrosis. May occur weeks to years later.
*   Pyloric stenosis.
*   Increased risk of esophageal carcinoma after decades.

**> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a diagram showing the esophagus with deep ulcerations and stricture formation in the middle 1/3rd, contrasting it with acid poisoning which affects the pylorus more.**

#### Fatal Dose and Period
*   **Fatal Dose:**
    *   KOH / NaOH: approx. **5 gm**.
    *   Ammonia: **15–20 ml**.
    *   Carbonates: **30 gm**.
*   **Fatal Period:** Usually **24 hours** due to shock or edema of glottis. Delayed death can occur due to malnutrition (strictures) or infection.

#### Diagnosis
*   History of ingestion.
*   **Litmus Test:** Vomitus or stomach contents turn **red litmus to blue**.
*   Physical nature of stomach contents: White, solid, slimy lumps which become warm on addition of water.

#### Treatment
**1. Decontamination**
*   **Do NOT perform Gastric Lavage or Emesis:** Contraindicated due to the risk of perforation of softened esophageal walls.
*   **Dilution:** Immediate administration of water or milk to dilute the alkali.
*   **Skin/Eyes:** Copious irrigation with water or saline for at least 20–30 minutes.

**2. Neutralization (Important Update)**
*   **Old Concept:** Previously, weak acids (vinegar/lemon juice) were recommended.
*   **Current Concept:** Neutralization is **NOT recommended** because the reaction between acid and alkali is **exothermic** (releases heat), which can cause further thermal injury to the already damaged mucosa.

**3. Supportive Care**
*   **Airway:** Tracheostomy or intubation if laryngeal edema develops.
*   **IV Fluids:** To correct shock and dehydration.
*   **Analgesics:** Parenteral opioids for pain relief.
*   **Corticosteroids:** Use is controversial; may prevent stricture formation if given early.
*   **Antibiotics:** To prevent secondary infection.
*   **[[Oesophagoscopy]]:** To grade the extent of injury (Grade I to III), usually performed within 24-48 hours.

#### Postmortem Appearances (Autopsy Findings)
**External:**
*   **Corrosion Marks:** Corrosion marks at angles of the mouth and chin. The marks are dark and parchment-like.
*   **Staining:** Brownish or greyish stains on skin and clothes.

**Internal:**
*   **Mucosa:** The mucous membrane of the mouth, throat, and esophagus appears **soft, swollen, and soap-like (soapy)**.
*   **Color:** Mucosa may be reddish-brown due to alkali hematin.
*   **Texture:** Tissues are **mucilaginous** (slimy) and edematous.
*   **Esophagus:** Shows marked softening and desquamation (more severe than stomach).
*   **Stomach:** May show inflammation; perforation is rare compared to sulfuric acid but can occur.
*   **Respiratory Tract:** Edema of glottis and congestion of trachea (if fumes inhaled).

#### Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Accidental:** Most common, especially in children mistaking solutions for water or milk.
*   **Suicidal:** Occasionally used due to easy availability of household cleaners.
*   **Homicidal:** Rare due to pungent taste and immediate pain.
*   **Vitriolage:** Throwing of corrosive alkalis (like ammonia or caustic soda) on the face is also considered vitriolage (grievous hurt).

#### Mnemonic
To remember the effects of Alkalis: **"SOAP"**
*   **S** - **S**oft, swollen mucosa (Liquefaction necrosis)
*   **O** - **O**esophagus affected more than stomach
*   **A** - **A**lkali hematin (brownish color)
*   **P** - **P**enetrates deeply (Saponification of fats)
