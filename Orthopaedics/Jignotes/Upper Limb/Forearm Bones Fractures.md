# [[Upper Limb]] > Forearm Bones Fractures

### General Considerations and Anatomy

Fractures of the forearm bones ([[Radius]] and [[Ulna]]) are common injuries affecting all age groups. They act as a functional unit to provide the movements of [[pronation]] and [[supination]].

*   **Muscle Influence on Displacement:** The displacement of fracture fragments is largely determined by the muscle attachments:
    *   **Proximal Third Fractures:** The proximal fragment is **supinated** by the [[biceps brachii]] and [[supinator muscle]]. The distal fragment is pronated by the [[pronator teres]] and [[pronator quadratus]].
    *   **Middle Third Fractures:** The proximal fragment is in **mid-pronation** (neutral) as the supinator and pronator teres balance each other. The distal fragment is pronated by the pronator quadratus.
    *   **Distal Third Fractures:** The proximal fragment is vertical, but the distal fragment is pulled by the [[pronator quadratus]].

**Clinical Implication:** This anatomical understanding dictates the position of immobilization in conservative treatment. Proximal fractures need immobilization in supination, while middle/distal fractures require mid-pronation.

### Mechanism of Injury

1.  **Direct Trauma:**
    *   **Nightstick Fracture:** An isolated fracture of the [[ulna]] shaft caused by a direct blow, typically when raising the arm to ward off a stick blow.
    *   Crush injuries (often cause comminuted fractures with soft tissue damage).
2.  **Indirect Trauma:**
    *   **Fall on Outstretched Hand (FOOSH):** The most common mechanism.
    *   Twisting forces: Usually result in spiral fractures at different levels.

### Classification

Forearm fractures can be classified based on:
1.  **Anatomical Level:** Proximal third, Middle third, Distal third.
2.  **Pattern:** Transverse, Oblique, Spiral, Comminuted, Segmental.
3.  **Involvement:**
    *   **Both Bone Forearm Fracture (BBFA):** Fracture of both radius and ulna.
    *   **Single Bone Fracture:** Isolated radius or ulna (must rule out associated dislocation).
    *   **Fracture-Dislocations:** [[Monteggia fracture]] and [[Galeazzi fracture]].

---

### Clinical Features

*   **Pain and Swelling:** Generalized over the forearm.
*   **Deformity:** Obvious angulation or rotation.
*   **Crepitus:** Palpable bone grating.
*   **Loss of Function:** Inability to pronate or supinate.
*   **Neurovascular Status:** Check for [[radial pulse]] and capillary refill. Assess [[radial nerve]], [[median nerve]], and [[ulnar nerve]] function.

**Clinical Implication:** In any isolated fracture of the radius or ulna, always examine the **Radio-Ulnar Joints** (Proximal and Distal). An isolated fracture of a single forearm bone is rare; assume a dislocation exists until proven otherwise ("Fracture of one bone implies dislocation of the other").

### Diagnostic Imaging

*   **X-rays:** Anteroposterior (AP) and Lateral views of the **entire forearm**.
*   **Rule of Twos:**
    *   Two joints: Wrist and Elbow must be included.
    *   Two views: AP and Lateral.
    *   Two limbs: Comparison views in children.

### Management

#### 1. Fractures in Children
*   **Greenstick Fractures:** Incomplete fractures. Treated by closed reduction (straightening) and cast immobilization.
*   **Plastic Deformation:** Bending without a visible fracture line.
*   **Complete Fractures:** Closed reduction and above-elbow cast.
    *   *Proximal 1/3:* Immobilize in full supination.
    *   *Middle 1/3:* Immobilize in mid-pronation.
    *   *Distal 1/3:* Immobilize in pronation.
*   **Operative:** [[Titanium Elastic Nailing System]] (TENS) is used for unstable or irreducible fractures.

#### 2. Fractures in Adults
Adult forearm fractures are inherently **unstable**. Perfect anatomical reduction is required to restore pronation/supination.
*   **Conservative:** Rarely indicated (only for undisplaced, isolated nightstick fractures).
*   **Operative (Gold Standard):** **Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF)**.
    *   **Implants:** [[Dynamic Compression Plate]] (DCP) or [[Limited Contact Dynamic Compression Plate]] (LC-DCP) with cortical screws.
    *   **Technique:**
        *   **Radius:** Approach via Anterior (Henry) or Posterior (Thompson) depending on level.
        *   **Ulna:** Subcutaneous posterior approach.
    *   **Intramedullary Nailing:** Used for segmental fractures, poor soft tissue conditions, or pathological fractures. Interlocking nails provide rotational stability.

### Specific Fracture-Dislocations

#### 1. Monteggia Fracture-Dislocation
*   **Definition:** Fracture of the **proximal third of the Ulna** with dislocation of the **[[Radial Head]]** (Proximal Radio-Ulnar Joint - PRUJ).
*   **Mechanism:** Fall on outstretched hand with forced pronation or direct blow.
*   **Classification (Bado Classification):**
    *   **Type I (Commonest):** Anterior dislocation of radial head + Anterior angulation of ulna.
    *   **Type II:** Posterior dislocation + Posterior angulation (Common in adults).
    *   **Type III:** Lateral dislocation (Common in children).
    *   **Type IV:** Fracture of both radius and ulna + Anterior dislocation of radial head.
*   **Nerve Injury:** [[Posterior Interosseous Nerve]] (PIN) palsy is common (Finger drop, thumb drop, but NO wrist drop usually).
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Adults:** ORIF of Ulna (Plating). The radial head usually reduces spontaneously once ulna length is restored.
    *   **Children:** Closed reduction and casting.

#### 2. Galeazzi Fracture-Dislocation
*   **Definition:** Fracture of the **distal third of the Radius** with disruption of the **[[Distal Radio-Ulnar Joint]]** (DRUJ).
*   **Alias:** Fracture of Necessity (Mandatory surgery in adults), Reverse Monteggia fracture, Piedmont fracture.
*   **Mechanism:** Fall on hand with rotation.
*   **Clinical Sign:** **Piano Key Sign** (Prominent ulnar head moves down on pressure and springs back).
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Adults:** ORIF of Radius (Plating). DRUJ is assessed; if unstable, it may require K-wire pinning or immobilization in supination.
    *   **Children:** Closed reduction.

#### 3. Essex-Lopresti Fracture
*   **Definition:** Comminuted fracture of the [[Radial Head]] + Disruption of the [[Interosseous Membrane]] + Dislocation of the DRUJ.
*   **Mechanism:** Longitudinal compression force.
*   **Consequence:** Proximal migration of the radius.
*   **Treatment:** Fixation or replacement of radial head. **Never excise the radial head** acutely (leads to severe proximal migration).

### Complications

1.  **[[Compartment Syndrome]] (Volkmann’s Ischemia):**
    *   High risk in forearm fractures (closed compartments).
    *   **Signs:** Pain on passive stretch (most important), Pallor, Paresthesia, Pulselessness, Paralysis (5 Ps).
    *   **Management:** Emergency [[Fasciotomy]].
2.  **Malunion:**
    *   Results in loss of pronation/supination.
    *   Requires osteotomy if functionally disabling.
3.  **Non-union:**
    *   More common in open fractures or infection.
4.  **Synostosis (Cross-Union):**
    *   Fusion between radius and ulna.
    *   Risk factors: Fracture at same level, massive soft tissue trauma, delayed surgery, violating the interosseous membrane during surgery.
    *   Result: Complete loss of rotation.
5.  **Nerve Injuries:**
    *   **Ulnar Nerve:** Nightstick fractures / Monteggia.
    *   **PIN:** Monteggia fracture.
    *   **AIN/Median:** Supracondylar or proximal forearm trauma.
