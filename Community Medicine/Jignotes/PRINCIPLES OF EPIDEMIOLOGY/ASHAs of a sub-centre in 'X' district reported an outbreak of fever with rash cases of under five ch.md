# [[PRINCIPLES OF EPIDEMIOLOGY]] > ASHAs of a sub-centre in 'X' district reported an outbreak of fever with rash cases of under five children. What do you mean by an outbreak? What stands for 'left out' and 'drop out' cases? As an administrative officer, how will you investigate this outbreak?

### **1. Definition of Outbreak**

An **[[Outbreak]]** (or Epidemic) is defined as the occurrence of cases of an illness, specific health-related behavior, or other health-related events in a community or region that is **clearly in excess of normal expectancy**.

*   **Normal Expectancy:** This is based on the average number of cases of the disease in the previous 3 to 5 years in that specific geographical area.
*   **The "Single Case" Rule:** For diseases that have been eliminated (e.g., Polio) or are not usually present (e.g., Smallpox), even **one single case** constitutes an outbreak and requires immediate reporting and investigation.
*   **Statistical Definition:** An epidemic exists if the number of cases exceeds **Mean + 2 Standard Deviations** (Mean + 2SD) of the past trend.

### **2. 'Left Out' and 'Drop Out' Cases**

In the context of the [[Universal Immunization Programme]], these terms describe beneficiaries who have missed vaccinations:

*   **[[Left Out]] Cases:** These are children or beneficiaries who have **never been reached** by the health system. They have not received *any* dose of any vaccine and are completely unimmunized.
    *   *Reason:* Often due to lack of access, migration, or lack of awareness.
*   **[[Drop Out]] Cases:** These are children who **started** the immunization schedule (e.g., received BCG or DPT-1) but **did not complete** the subsequent required doses (e.g., did not return for DPT-2 or Measles).
    *   *Calculation:* Drop-out rates are often calculated between specific vaccines (e.g., BCG to Measles drop-out rate) to assess program efficiency.

### **3. Investigation of the Outbreak**

As an administrative officer, the investigation of this "Fever with Rash" outbreak (suspected [[Measles]]/Rubella) generally follows a 10-step protocol.

**Mnemonic for Steps:** **V**ery **C**onfident **D**octors **S**earch **D**ata **F**or **T**rue **E**cological **R**eports.

#### **Step 1: Verification of Diagnosis**
*   **Clinical:** Do not rely solely on ASHA reports. A medical officer must examine a sample of cases. Look for the classic triad: Fever + Rash + Coryza/Cough/Conjunctivitis (3 C's) and **Koplik’s spots** (pathognomonic for Measles).
*   **Laboratory:** Collect blood samples (serum) for IgM ELISA (Measles/Rubella) and throat swabs/urine for virus isolation. Do *not* wait for lab results to start control measures.

#### **Step 2: Confirmation of the Epidemic**
*   Compare the current number of "fever with rash" cases with the data from the same months over the previous 3–5 years.
*   If the current number is **clearly in excess** of the background frequency, an outbreak is confirmed.

#### **Step 3: Defining the Population at Risk**
*   Obtain a detailed map of the Sub-centre area.
*   Identify the specific denominator (e.g., all under-five children in the affected villages).
*   *Census:* Check if the area has floating populations (migrants, nomads) who might be 'left outs'.

#### **Step 4: Rapid Search for Cases (Active Surveillance)**
*   **Medical Survey:** Deploy health workers (ANMs, Anganwadi workers) to conduct a house-to-house search for children with fever and rash.
*   **Epidemiological Case Sheet:** Collect data on name, age, immunization status, date of onset, and history of travel.
*   **Search Period:** Continue searching daily until **twice the incubation period** (approx. 28 days for measles) has passed since the last case.

#### **Step 5: Data Analysis**
Analyze data by **Time, Place, and Person**:
*   **Time:** Construct an **[[Epidemic Curve]]**. If it shows a sharp rise and fall, it is a point source (common vehicle). If it rises gradually, it is propagated (person-to-person).
    *   > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Epidemic Curve showing number of cases on Y-axis vs Time on X-axis
*   **Place:** Prepare a **Spot Map** to identify clustering of cases (e.g., around a specific school or slum).
*   **Person:** Analyze attack rates by age (under 5 vs older), sex, and immunization status (vaccinated vs unvaccinated).

#### **Step 6: Formulation of Hypothesis**
Based on the analysis, formulate a hypothesis regarding:
*   **Source:** e.g., An index case returned from a relative's village.
*   **Mode of Spread:** Respiratory droplet (likely for fever with rash).
*   **Determinant:** Low immunization coverage (high drop-out rates).

#### **Step 7: Testing the Hypothesis**
*   Calculate **Attack Rates** among the vaccinated vs. unvaccinated.
*   If the attack rate is significantly higher in the 'left out' and 'drop out' children, the hypothesis (failure of immunization coverage) is supported.

#### **Step 8: Evaluation of Ecological Factors**
*   Assess living conditions: Overcrowding, ventilation, and nutritional status (Malnutrition aggravates measles).

#### **Step 9: Further Investigation**
*   Determine why there are so many 'left outs' and 'drop outs'. Is it vaccine hesitancy? Lack of cold chain? Rude behavior of staff?.

#### **Step 10: Writing the Report & Control Measures**
*   **Report:** Submit a comprehensive report to higher authorities.
*   **Immediate Control (The "Action" Part):**
    1.  **Isolation:** Isolate active cases for 7 days after rash onset.
    2.  **Vitamin A:** Administer massive doses of **[[Vitamin A]]** to all sick children to prevent blindness and reduce mortality (Measles depletes Vitamin A).
    3.  **Ring Vaccination:** Vaccinate all susceptible children (contacts) within 2-3 days of exposure if possible.
    4.  **Catch-up Campaign:** Organize special camps to vaccinate all 'left out' and 'drop out' children.
