# Economics and Health

### **1. Introduction and Definitions**

*   **Economics:** Traditionally defined as the study of wealth (Adam Smith) or the study of human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means. It deals with **production**, **distribution**, and **consumption** of goods and services,.
*   **[[Health Economics]]:** A discipline determining the price and quantity of limited financial and non-financial resources devoted to the care of the sick and promotion of health.
    *   **Goal:** To quantify resources used in health delivery and manage them for maximum efficiency to achieve optimal individual and national productivity.

### **2. Inter-relationship between Health and Development**

Health and economic development share a **reciprocal relationship**. Health is not merely a service consumed; it is a vital **investment**.

**A. How Health Promotes Economic Development:**
1.  **Increase in Productivity:** Healthy individuals work more efficiently. Disease compromises working capacity and lowers economic productivity at individual and national levels.
2.  **Reduced Absenteeism:** Better health inputs decrease sickness absenteeism in industries and schools.
3.  **Demographic Effects:** Improved health and [[Family Planning]] services lead to a decrease in birth and death rates, resulting in a favorable population structure with more productive adults.
4.  **Better Quality of Life:** Adequate health services lead to a state of enthusiasm, vigor, and happiness, which are essential for development.

**B. How Development Affects Health:**
1.  **Improved Services:** Economic growth allows for better health infrastructure (hospitals, sanitation, water supply).
2.  **Demographic Transition:** "Development is the best contraceptive." Development generally leads to decreased fertility and [[Infant Mortality Rate]].
3.  **Negative Effects:** Unsustainable development can lead to environmental pollution, urbanization stress, and lifestyle diseases (obesity, hypertension).

### **3. The Vicious Cycle of Poverty and Ill-Health**

**Poverty** is often cited as the biggest single cause of death, disease, and suffering. It creates a trap that is difficult to escape without external intervention.

*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **Physical:** Inadequate food and shelter decrease body defense mechanisms.
    *   **Social:** Low standard of living leads to communicable diseases.
    *   **Economic:** Sickness leads to loss of wages and increased expenditure, pushing the family further into poverty.

### **4. Basic Economic Concepts in Health**

*   **Scarcity:** Health needs are infinite, but resources (money, time, manpower) are limited. This necessitates prioritization and rationing.
*   **Demand:** The quantity of health services requested. Effective demand requires the **willingness and ability to pay**.
*   **Need:** Deficiencies in health that call for preventive or curative measures (e.g., vaccination, surgery). Needs may be "felt" (perceived by patient) or "real" (perceived by expert).
*   **Opportunity Cost:** The value of the best alternative use of resources that is forgone when a specific choice is made (e.g., spending money on a CT scan machine vs. rural immunization).

### **5. Economic Evaluation Techniques (Health Management)**

These are quantitative methods used to aid decision-making in health planning,,.

| Technique | Measurement of Cost | Measurement of Benefit/Outcome | Utility/Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Cost-Benefit Analysis]] (CBA)** | Monetary terms (Money) | **Monetary terms** (Money) | To determine if a project is economically sound. Comparing economic benefits vs. costs. |
| **[[Cost-Effectiveness Analysis]] (CEA)** | Monetary terms | **Natural Units** (e.g., Life years gained, cases prevented, lives saved) | Used when benefits cannot be monetized. Compares different ways to achieve the same goal. |
| **[[Cost-Utility Analysis]] (CUA)** | Monetary terms | **Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)** or **DALYs** | Incorporates the *quality* of life outcomes, not just quantity. |
| **Cost-Minimization Analysis** | Monetary terms | Assumed to be **identical** across options | Finding the cheapest way to do the exact same thing. |

**Mnemonic for Evaluation Types:**
**"BEMU"**
*   **B**enefit analysis = Money ($)
*   **E**ffectiveness analysis = Natural units (Lives)
*   **M**inimization = Cheapest option
*   **U**tility analysis = QALYs (Quality)

### **6. Health Financing**

Sources of finance for the health sector include,:
1.  **Public Sources:** Government taxation (State and Central).
2.  **Private Sources:** Households (Out-of-pocket expenditure), NGOs, Corporate sector.
3.  **Health Insurance:**
    *   Social Insurance (e.g., [[ESI Scheme]], [[CGHS]]).
    *   Voluntary/Private Insurance.
4.  **External Aid:** Bilateral and International agencies (WHO, World Bank).

**Clinical Relevance:**
*   **Rational Prescribing:** Doctors must practice cost-effective medicine (e.g., generic vs. branded drugs) to reduce the financial burden on patients.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Decisions on purchasing high-tech equipment vs. basic public health measures (e.g., CT scan vs. Vaccines) involve opportunity costs.

### **7. Economic Indicators of Health**

These indicators do not measure health directly but are crucial for interpretation.
1.  **[[Gross National Product]] (GNP) per capita:** The total value of goods and services produced by residents of a country.
2.  **[[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP):** Gross income generated *within* a country.
3.  **Dependency Ratio:** Ratio of economically dependent part of the population (0-14 yrs and >65 yrs) to the productive part (15-64 yrs).
4.  **Employment Levels:** Unemployment is associated with higher morbidity and mortality.
