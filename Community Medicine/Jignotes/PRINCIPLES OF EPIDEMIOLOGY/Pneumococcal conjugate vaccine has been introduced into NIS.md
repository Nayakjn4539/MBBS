# [[PRINCIPLES OF EPIDEMIOLOGY]] > Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has been introduced into NIS

### **Introduction of Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) in NIS**

The [[Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV)]] was introduced into the [[Universal Immunization Programme (UIP)]] to combat the high burden of pneumococcal diseases, specifically pneumonia, among children in India.

#### **1. Launch and Implementation**
*   **Launch Date:** The vaccine was officially launched in **May 2017**.
*   **Phased Introduction:** It was initially introduced in **Himachal Pradesh**, 6 districts of **Uttar Pradesh**, and 17 districts of **Bihar**.
*   **Expansion:** It was subsequently expanded to Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, and eventually covered the entire country by **2021**.

#### **2. Objective**
*   To reduce infant mortality and morbidity caused by **Streptococcus pneumoniae**.
*   It protects against severe forms of pneumococcal disease such as **Pneumonia**, **Meningitis**, and **Septicemia**.

#### **3. Vaccine Schedule under NIS**
The vaccine follows a **"2 + 1"** schedule (2 Primary doses + 1 Booster).

| **Dose** | **Age** | **Rationale** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1st Primary Dose** | **6 weeks** | Given alongside Pentavalent-1, OPV-1, Rotavirus-1, fIPV-1. |
| **2nd Primary Dose** | **14 weeks** | Given alongside Pentavalent-3, OPV-3, Rotavirus-3, fIPV-2. |
| **Booster Dose** | **9 months** | Given alongside Measles-Rubella-1 (MR-1) and Vitamin A. |

> **Note:** PCV is **not** given at 10 weeks under the NIS to minimize the number of injections in a single visit and optimize immune response.

#### **4. Administration Details**
*   **Dose:** **0.5 ml**.
*   **Route:** **Intramuscular (IM)** injection.
*   **Site:** **Antero-lateral aspect of the mid-thigh**.
    *   **Specific Side:** **Right** thigh is preferred to distinguish it from the Pentavalent vaccine, which is usually given on the left thigh.
*   **Syringe:** Auto-disable (AD) syringe.

#### **5. Vaccine Characteristics**
*   **Type:** **Conjugate Vaccine** (Polysaccharide antigen linked to a protein carrier to enhance immunogenicity in infants).
*   **Formulation:** Liquid vaccine; **preservative-free**.
*   **Storage:** Store at **+2°C to +8°C**. Do **not** freeze.
    *   **Shake Test:** Applicable to check for freeze damage.
*   **Open Vial Policy:** Applicable (can be used up to 28 days if VVM is valid and proper cold chain is maintained).

#### **6. Contraindications & Side Effects**
*   **Contraindications:**
    *   Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a previous dose.
    *   Severe allergic reaction to any component, including **Diphtheria toxoid**.
    *   Should not be given to children with severe acute illness (postpone vaccination).
*   **Side Effects:** Mild fever, irritability, swelling, or tenderness at the injection site.

### **Clinical Relevance**
Pneumonia is a leading cause of under-five mortality in India. The introduction of [[PCV]] aims to significantly lower the incidence of bacterial pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), thereby contributing to the reduction of the **Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)** and **Under-5 Mortality Rate (U5MR)**.

### **Mnemonic to Remember**
**"PCV is Right for Respiration"**
*   **Right:** Administered on the **Right** thigh.
*   **Respiration:** Protects against **Respiratory** infection (Pneumonia).
