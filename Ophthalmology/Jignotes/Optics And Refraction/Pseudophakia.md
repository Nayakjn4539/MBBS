# Pseudophakia

**Pseudophakia** (or Artephakia) is the condition in which the natural crystalline [[Lens]] has been removed and replaced by an artificial [[Intraocular Lens]] (IOL). It is the standard of care for optical rehabilitation following cataract surgery.

### Optical Status of Pseudophakia
The refractive status of a pseudophakic eye depends entirely on the power of the implanted IOL.
1.  **Consecutive Emmetropia:** Ideally, the IOL power is calculated to make the patient emmetropic for distance. The patient requires plus lenses (spectacles) only for near vision (due to loss of accommodation).
2.  **Consecutive Myopia:** Occurs if the implanted IOL is too strong (over-correction). The patient needs minus glasses for distance.
3.  **Consecutive Hypermetropia:** Occurs if the implanted IOL is too weak (under-correction). The patient needs plus glasses for distance and stronger plus glasses for near.

> **Clinical Implication:** Unlike the natural lens, a standard monofocal IOL cannot change its shape to focus on near objects. Therefore, **loss of [[Accommodation]]** is a consistent feature of pseudophakia (unless pseudo-accommodative or multifocal IOLs are used).

### Clinical Signs of Pseudophakia
On examination (slit-lamp and torchlight), the following signs distinguish a pseudophakic eye from a normal (phakic) or aphakic eye:

*   **Surgical Scar:** A limbal or clear corneal scar is often visible.
*   **Anterior Chamber (AC):** Slightly **deeper** than a normal phakic eye (as the IOL is thinner than the natural lens) but shallower than an aphakic eye.
*   **Iris:** Mild **[[Iridodonesis]]** (tremulousness of the iris) may be present, though less marked than in aphakia.
*   **Pupil:** Usually **jet black** in color. When light is shone, shining reflexes (glint) from the smooth surface of the IOL are seen.
*   **Purkinje Images:** **Four** images are seen (similar to a phakic eye).
    *   Images 1 & 2: From the cornea.
    *   Images 3 & 4: From the anterior and posterior surfaces of the **IOL** (In aphakia, only images 1 & 2 are present).
*   **Visualization of IOL:** The IOL optic and haptics can be visualized after pupillary dilation on slit-lamp biomicroscopy. The posterior capsule may show opacification (PCO).

### Intraocular Lenses (IOLs)
The first IOL implantation was performed by **Sir Harold Ridley** in 1949.

#### Classification of IOLs

| Basis of Classification | Types and Descriptions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Site of Fixation** | 1. **[[Posterior Chamber IOL]] (PC-IOL):** <br> - **In-the-bag:** Most physiological; fixed in the capsular bag. <br> - **Ciliary Sulcus:** Used if posterior capsule support is compromised.<br> - **Scleral Fixated (SFIOL):** Sutured or glued to sclera if no capsule exists.<br> - **Iris-claw (Retro-iris):** Clipped to the back of the iris.<br>2. **[[Anterior Chamber IOL]] (AC-IOL):** Angle-supported or Iris-claw. Used when PC support is absent. |
| **Material** | 1. **Rigid:** [[PMMA]] (Polymethylmethacrylate). Requires large incision (5-6 mm).<br>2. **Foldable:** Acrylic (Hydrophobic/Hydrophilic), Silicone, Collamer. Can be injected through small incisions (2.2–3.2 mm).<br>3. **Rollable:** Ultra-thin hydrogel lenses for micro-incisions (< 2 mm). |
| **Focusing Ability** | 1. **Monofocal:** Corrects vision for one distance (usually far).<br>2. **Multifocal:** Has diffractive/refractive rings for distance and near.<br>3. **Toric IOL:** Corrects pre-existing corneal [[Astigmatism]].<br>4. **Accommodative:** Moves forward/backward or changes shape to focus. |

#### Biometry (IOL Power Calculation)
To achieve emmetropia, the IOL power must be calculated precisely before surgery.
*   **Measurements required:**
    1.  **Axial Length (AL):** Measured by A-scan ultrasonography or Optical Biometry (IOL Master/Lenstar).
    2.  **Keratometry (K):** Corneal curvature.
    3.  **A-Constant:** Specific to the IOL type.
*   **SRK Formula:**
    $$P = A - 2.5L - 0.9K$$
    *(Where P = IOL Power, A = Constant, L = Axial Length, K = Keratometry)*

### Advantages of Pseudophakia (over Aphakic Spectacles)
Correction of aphakia with an IOL is superior to spectacles because:
1.  **No Image Magnification:** Spectacles cause ~30% magnification; IOLs cause minimal to no magnification.
2.  **Full Visual Field:** No peripheral constriction or "Jack-in-the-box" scotoma seen with high-plus glasses.
3.  **Binocular Vision:** Possible even in unilateral cases (no aniseikonia).
4.  **Cosmesis:** Normal appearance of the eye.
5.  **Better Physical Activity:** No heavy glasses required.

### Complications Specific to Pseudophakia

#### 1. Malpositions of IOL
Displacement of the lens due to zonular weakness or capsular tears.
*   **Sunset Syndrome:** Inferior subluxation of the IOL.
*   **Sunrise Syndrome:** Superior subluxation of the IOL.
*   **Lost Lens Syndrome:** Complete dislocation into the [[Vitreous]].
*   **Windshield Wiper Syndrome:** Occurs when a small IOL is placed in the sulcus; the lens moves side-to-side with head movement.

#### 2. Posterior Capsule Opacification (PCO)
Also known as **After-Cataract** or **Secondary Cataract**.
*   **Cause:** Proliferation of residual lens epithelial cells on the posterior capsule.
*   **Incidence:** Most common late complication.
*   **Types:**
    *   **[[Elschnig's Pearls]]:** Cluster of vacuolated cells (resemble soap bubbles).
    *   **[[Soemmering's Ring]]:** Doughnut-shaped proliferation in the periphery.
*   **Treatment:** **Nd:YAG Laser Capsulotomy**.

#### 3. Pseudophakic Bullous Keratopathy (PBK)
*   Corneal edema due to endothelial damage during surgery or toxic reaction to the IOL (especially old AC-IOLs).
*   Requires medical management (hypertonic saline) or corneal transplantation (DSEK/PKP).

#### 4. Cystoid Macular Edema (CME)
*   Also called **[[Irvine-Gass Syndrome]]**.
*   Accumulation of fluid in the outer plexiform layer of the macula post-surgery.
*   **FFA:** Shows characteristic "Flower-petal" appearance.

#### 5. UGH Syndrome
*   **U**veitis, **G**laucoma, **H**yphema.
*   Caused by mechanical chafing of the iris by the IOL (mostly rigid AC-IOLs).

#### 6. Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome (TASS)
*   Acute, sterile postoperative inflammation caused by toxins (e.g., sterilization residues) on the IOL surface.

### Management of Refractive Errors in Pseudophakia
1.  **Spectacles:** Almost all monofocal pseudophakes require **Near Add** (usually +2.5D to +3.0D) for reading. Distance correction is given if biometry was not perfect (consecutive error).
2.  **IOL Exchange:** If the refractive surprise is very large.
3.  **Piggyback IOL:** Placing a second IOL over the first to correct residual power.
4.  **Corneal Refractive Surgery:** [[LASIK]] or PRK to fine-tune the result.
