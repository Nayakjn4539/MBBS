# [[Sports Injuries]] > Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury

### Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Injury

#### Introduction and Functional Anatomy
The [[Anterior Cruciate Ligament]] (ACL) is a critical stabilizer of the [[Knee Joint]]. Its primary function is to prevent anterior translation (gliding) of the [[Tibia]] on the [[Femur]]. It also provides rotational stability, preventing excessive internal rotation. The ACL acts as a secondary restraint to valgus and varus stress.

#### Mechanism of Injury
ACL injuries are common in sports involving pivoting, twisting, or sudden deceleration.
*   **Non-contact injuries (Most common):** Twisting force with the knee bent and taking weight, or sudden deceleration.
*   **Contact injuries:** A direct blow to the lateral side of the knee (valgus force).
*   **Hyperextension:** Forceful hyperextension of the knee can rupture the ACL.

**Clinical Implication:**
A patient often reports hearing a loud "pop" at the time of injury, followed by the knee "giving way" or buckling. Rapid swelling due to [[Haemarthrosis]] usually develops within 1-2 hours.

#### Clinical Examination: The Lachman Test
The **[[Lachman Test]]** is considered the most sensitive and reliable clinical test for diagnosing an ACL injury, particularly in the acute setting where pain and muscle spasm may limit flexion.

**Procedure:**
1.  **Position:** The patient lies supine. The examiner holds the patient's knee in **20–30 degrees of flexion**.
2.  **Stabilization:** The examiner stabilizes the distal [[Femur]] with one hand (usually the non-dominant hand).
3.  **Maneuver:** With the other hand, the examiner grasps the proximal [[Tibia]] (behind the tibial tubercle) and applies an anterior force, attempting to pull the tibia forward.
4.  **Assessment:** The amount of anterior translation and the quality of the "end point" are evaluated.

**Interpretation:**
*   **Positive Test:** Increased anterior translation of the tibia compared to the uninjured contralateral knee and a **"soft" or mushy end point** (lack of a sudden, hard stop) indicates an ACL tear.
*   **Negative Test:** A firm, hard end point with minimal translation suggests an intact ACL.

**Why is Lachman Better than the Anterior Drawer Test?**
*   **Muscle Relaxation:** At 20–30 degrees of flexion, the [[Hamstrings]] are more relaxed compared to the 90 degrees required for the Anterior Drawer test, preventing false negatives due to muscle spasm.
*   **Meniscal Blocking:** In the Anterior Drawer position (90 degrees), the posterior horn of the [[Medial Meniscus]] can sometimes block anterior translation of the tibia, masking an ACL tear; the Lachman position avoids this.

#### Other Special Tests for ACL

| Test | Technique | Clinical Utility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Anterior Drawer Test]]** | Knee flexed to 90°, hip flexed to 45°. Examiner sits on foot and pulls tibia anteriorly. | Less sensitive than Lachman; often painful in acute injury. False negatives due to hamstring spasm. |
| **[[Pivot Shift Test]]** | Knee extended, valgus stress applied + internal rotation of tibia. Knee is slowly flexed. | Highly **specific** for ACL rupture. Detects rotatory instability. Subluxation occurs at 30-40 degrees flexion. |
| **[[Lelli Test]]** (Lever Sign) | Not explicitly detailed in sources but noted as a clinical test. | Alternative method for diagnosis. |

#### Investigations
*   **X-ray:** Usually normal in soft tissue injuries.
    *   **[[Segond Fracture]]:** An avulsion fracture of the lateral capsule/tibial plateau. If present, it is pathognomonic for an ACL tear.
    *   **Tibial Spine Avulsion:** May be seen, especially in adolescents.
*   **[[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI):** The investigation of choice (Gold Standard). It accurately visualizes the ligament disruption and identifies associated injuries like [[Meniscal Tear]] or bone bruising.
*   **[[Arthroscopy]]:** The diagnostic gold standard, allowing for direct visualization and simultaneous treatment.

#### Management
**Conservative Treatment:**
*   Indicated for older, sedentary patients or those with partial tears who have no instability in daily activities.
*   **Protocol:** [[RICE Protocol]] (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation), aspiration of haemarthrosis (if tense), functional bracing, and physiotherapy to strengthen [[Quadriceps]] and [[Hamstrings]].

**Surgical Treatment:**
*   **Indication:** Young active patients, professional athletes, or those with symptomatic instability (giving way).
*   **Procedure:** **[[ACL Reconstruction]]**. Direct repair of the torn ligament is generally not successful. The ligament is reconstructed using a graft.
*   **Graft Options:**
    *   Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone (BPTB) graft.
    *   [[Semitendinosus]] and [[Gracilis]] tendon autografts (Hamstring graft).

**Clinical Implication:**
Following injury, the knee should not be immobilized in complete extension or a plaster cylinder, as this leads to stiffness. Motion should be encouraged early.

#### Mnemonics
*   To remember the attachments of the Cruciate Ligaments on the Tibia: **LAMP**
    *   **L**ateral condyle of femur -> **A**nterior cruciate ligament.
    *   **M**edial condyle of femur -> **P**osterior cruciate ligament.
*   To remember the most sensitive test: **L**achman is **L**eading (Best).
