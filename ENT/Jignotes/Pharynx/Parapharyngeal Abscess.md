# [[Pharynx]] > Parapharyngeal Abscess

### [[Parapharyngeal Abscess]]

**Synonyms:** Pharyngomaxillary abscess, Lateral pharyngeal space abscess.

#### **Introduction and Applied Anatomy**
The [[Parapharyngeal Space]] is a deep neck space shaped like an inverted pyramid.
*   **Base:** Skull base (superiorly).
*   **Apex:** Hyoid bone (inferiorly).
*   **Location:** Lateral to the pharynx.

**Boundaries:**
*   **Medial:** [[Buccopharyngeal fascia]] covering the superior constrictor muscle.
*   **Lateral:** Medial pterygoid muscle, ascending ramus of the [[Mandible]], and deep lobe of the [[Parotid gland]].
*   **Posterior:** Prevertebral fascia covering prevertebral muscles.
*   **Anterior:** Pterygomandibular raphe.

**Compartments:**
The [[Styloid process]] and muscles attached to it (styloid diaphragm) divide the space into two compartments:
1.  **Pre-styloid (Anterior) Compartment:** Lies anterior to the styloid process.
2.  **Post-styloid (Posterior) Compartment:** Lies posterior to the styloid process.

**Contents of Compartments:**

| Feature | Pre-styloid Compartment | Post-styloid Compartment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Contents** | Fat, loose areolar tissue, lymph nodes, internal maxillary artery branches | [[Internal Carotid Artery]] (ICA), [[Internal Jugular Vein]] (IJV), Cranial Nerves IX, X, XI, XII, [[Sympathetic chain]], Upper deep cervical lymph nodes |
| **Relations** | Medially related to [[Tonsillar fossa]]; Laterally to [[Medial Pterygoid muscle]] | Medially related to posterior lateral pharyngeal wall; Laterally to [[Parotid gland]] |

#### **Etiology (Sources of Infection)**
Infection in the parapharyngeal space can spread from various surrounding structures:
*   **Pharynx (Most Common):** Acute and chronic infections of the [[Tonsil]] (tonsillitis) and [[Adenoids]]. Spread from a [[Peritonsillar abscess]].
*   **Odontogenic (Dental):** Infections of the lower last molar (wisdom tooth).
*   **Ear:** From the mastoid tip via [[Bezold’s abscess]] (mastoiditis) or [[Petrositis]].
*   **Other Spaces:** Spread from [[Parotid abscess]], [[Retropharyngeal abscess]], or submandibular space.
*   **Trauma:** Penetrating injuries of the neck or injection of local anesthetic for tonsillectomy/mandibular nerve block.

**Microbiology:**
*   Usually polymicrobial involving mixed aerobes and anaerobes.
*   Common organisms: *Streptococcus*, *Staphylococcus*, *Bacteroides*, and *Peptostreptococcus*.

#### **Clinical Features**
The clinical presentation depends on which compartment is involved. General symptoms of toxemia (fever, chills, malaise) are common to both.

**1. General Symptoms:**
*   **Fever:** High grade with chills and rigors.
*   **Pain:** Severe throat pain and neck pain (odynophagia).
*   **Torticollis:** Neck tilted to the healthy side due to spasm of prevertebral muscles.

**2. Compartment Specific Signs:**

| Sign/Symptom | Anterior (Pre-styloid) Abscess | Posterior (Post-styloid) Abscess |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tonsil Position** | **Prolapse of tonsil** and fossa medially (pushed towards midline). | Pharyngeal bulge behind the **posterior pillar**. Tonsil displacement is minimal. |
| **Trismus** | **Marked** (Due to spasm of [[Medial Pterygoid muscle]]). | **Minimal or Absent**. |
| **External Swelling** | Swelling at the angle of the jaw. | Swelling in the parotid region or behind SCM. |
| **Neurological Signs** | Absent. | Paralysis of CN IX, X, XI, XII and [[Horner's syndrome]]. |

**Mnemonic for Anterior Compartment:** **3 T's**
*   **T**rismus
*   **T**onsil prolapse (medial push)
*   **T**ender angle of jaw

**Mnemonic for Horner's Syndrome (Post-styloid involvement):** **AMPLE**
*   **A**nhidrosis
*   **M**iosis
*   **P**tosis (partial)
*   **L**oss of ciliospinal reflex
*   **E**nophthalmos

#### **Differential Diagnosis**
1.  **[[Peritonsillar Abscess]] (Quinsy):** In Quinsy, only the tonsil is pushed medially; in parapharyngeal abscess, the entire lateral pharyngeal wall is pushed medially. Trismus is present in both, but external neck swelling is prominent in parapharyngeal abscess.
2.  **Retropharyngeal Abscess:** Presents with a unilateral paramedian bulge of the posterior pharyngeal wall.
3.  **Dental Abscess/Masticator space infection.**
4.  **Parotid Abscess.**
5.  **Tumors:** Deep lobe parotid tumors or Neurogenic tumors (Schwannoma/Paraganglioma).

#### **Investigations**
1.  **CT Scan (Contrast Enhanced):**
    *   **Gold Standard.**
    *   Determines location, extent, relation to great vessels, and differentiates abscess (ring enhancement) from cellulitis.
2.  **Needle Aspiration:** For Gram stain and culture sensitivity (can be ultrasound-guided).
3.  **X-ray Neck (Lateral view):** May show widening of prevertebral soft tissue or air-fluid levels (less specific than CT).
4.  **Complete Blood Count:** Leukocytosis.

---

#### **Complications**
If left untreated, it can be life-threatening:
1.  **Respiratory Obstruction:** Due to severe [[Laryngeal edema]] requiring tracheostomy.
2.  **Vascular Complications (Post-styloid):**
    *   **[[Internal Jugular Vein Thrombosis]] (Lemierre's syndrome):** Signs include chills, spiking fever, and tenderness along the SCM. Can lead to septic emboli in lungs.
    *   **Carotid Artery Erosion/Rupture:** Can cause fatal hemorrhage. Often preceded by "herald bleeds" (minor bleeds).
3.  **Mediastinitis:** Spread of infection downwards along the carotid sheath into the mediastinum.
4.  **Cranial Nerve Palsies:** IX, X, XI, XII.
5.  **Septicemia.**

#### **Treatment**

**1. Medical Management:**
*   **Hospitalization:** Essential for monitoring airway and vitals.
*   **Intravenous Antibiotics:** High dose, broad-spectrum covering aerobes and anaerobes (e.g., Cephalosporins + Metronidazole or Clindamycin).
*   **Fluid Resuscitation:** To maintain hydration.
*   **Airway Management:** Secure airway; tracheostomy may be needed if there is significant respiratory distress or trismus making intubation difficult.

**2. Surgical Management:**
*   **Incision and Drainage (External Approach):**
    *   **Indication:** Frank abscess formation not responding to antibiotics.
    *   **Procedure:** A horizontal incision is made **2–3 cm below the angle of the mandible** (to avoid injury to the marginal mandibular nerve).
    *   Blunt dissection is carried out along the inner surface of the medial pterygoid muscle towards the styloid process to evacuate the pus.
    *   A drain is inserted.

*   **Clinical Warning:** **Transoral drainage should NEVER be done** for parapharyngeal abscess due to the risk of injury to the great vessels (Internal Carotid Artery) which traverse this space.
