# Anatomy and Physiology of Lacrimal Apparatus

The [[lacrimal apparatus]] consists of two distinct systems: the **Secretory System** (responsible for producing tears) and the **Excretory System** (responsible for draining tears),.

---

## 1. Secretory System: The Lacrimal Glands

The secretory system is composed of the main lacrimal gland and the accessory lacrimal glands.

### A. Main Lacrimal Gland
*   **Location:** Situated in the fossa for the lacrimal gland in the superolateral part of the orbit (orbital plate of frontal bone),.
*   **Parts:** It is divided into two parts by the lateral horn of the aponeurosis of the [[levator palpebrae superioris]] (LPS) muscle,:
    1.  **Orbital Part (Superior):** Larger, almond-shaped.
    2.  **Palpebral Part (Inferior):** Smaller, consists of 1-2 lobules.
*   **Ducts:** Approximately 10–12 excretory ducts pass from the orbital part through the palpebral part to open into the lateral part of the [[superior fornix]],.
    *   *Clinical Implication:* Removal of the palpebral part effectively cuts off drainage from the orbital part as well.

### B. Accessory Lacrimal Glands
These glands are responsible for basal tear secretion,.
1.  **[[Glands of Krause]]:** Located in the subconjunctival tissue of the fornices. There are about 42 in the upper fornix and 6–8 in the lower fornix,.
2.  **[[Glands of Wolfring]] (Ciaccio):** Located near the upper border of the superior [[tarsal plate]] and lower border of the inferior tarsal plate,.

### C. Neurovascular Supply
*   **Blood Supply:** [[Lacrimal artery]] (branch of the [[ophthalmic artery]]).
*   **Nerve Supply:**
    *   **Sensory:** [[Lacrimal nerve]] (branch of Ophthalmic division of [[Trigeminal nerve]]/CN V).
    *   **Sympathetic:** Carotid plexus (travels with lacrimal artery).
    *   **Parasympathetic (Secretomotor):** Controls reflex secretion,.
        *   **Pathway:** [[Superior Salivatory Nucleus]] (Pons) $\rightarrow$ Facial Nerve (CN VII) $\rightarrow$ [[Greater Superficial Petrosal Nerve]] $\rightarrow$ Vidian Nerve $\rightarrow$ [[Pterygopalatine Ganglion]] (Relay) $\rightarrow$ Zygomatic Nerve $\rightarrow$ Lacrimal Nerve $\rightarrow$ [[Lacrimal Gland]],.

| Type of Innervation | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Parasympathetic** | Secretomotor (Stimulates secretion) |
| **Sympathetic** | Inhibitory function/Vasomotor, |
| **Sensory** | Pain, touch, temperature |

## 2. Excretory System: The Lacrimal Passages

The drainage system conducts tears from the [[conjunctival sac]] into the nasal cavity.

### Anatomy of Drainage Structures
1.  **[[Lacrimal Puncta]]:** Two small openings (upper and lower) situated on the lacrimal papilla at the lid margin, dipping into the [[lacus lacrimalis]].
    *   *Position:* The upper punctum is situated slightly medial to the lower punctum.
2.  **[[Lacrimal Canaliculi]]:** Connect puncta to the lacrimal sac.
    *   **Vertical Part:** 1–2 mm long.
    *   **Horizontal Part:** 6–8 mm long.
    *   **Common Canaliculus:** The upper and lower canaliculi often join to form a common tube before entering the sac.
    *   **[[Valve of Rosenmuller]]:** A fold of mucosa guarding the opening of the canaliculus into the sac, preventing reflux.
3.  **[[Lacrimal Sac]]:**
    *   **Location:** Situated in the [[lacrimal fossa]] formed by the [[lacrimal bone]] and the frontal process of the [[maxilla]],.
    *   **Covering:** Enclosed by lacrimal fascia (periorbita).
    *   **Parts:** Fundus, Body, and Neck.
4.  **[[Nasolacrimal Duct]] (NLD):**
    *   **Extent:** Extends from the neck of the lacrimal sac to the [[inferior meatus]] of the nose,.
    *   **Length:** Approximately 15–18 mm,.
    *   **Direction:** Downwards, Backwards, and Laterally,.
    *   **[[Valve of Hasner]]:** A mucosal fold guarding the lower opening of the NLD.
        *   *Clinical Implication:* Imperforation of this valve is the most common cause of [[congenital dacryocystitis]],.

## 3. Physiology of Tears: The Tear Film

The pre-corneal tear film is a fluid layer covering the [[cornea]] and [[conjunctiva]]. It is approximately 7–9 $\mu$m thick,.

### Structure of Tear Film (Three Layers)
From posterior (corneal side) to anterior:

| Layer | Source | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Mucin Layer** (Innermost) | **[[Goblet cells]]** of conjunctiva, [[Crypts of Henle]], [[Glands of Manz]],,. | Converts hydrophobic corneal surface to **hydrophilic** (wettable) surface. |
| **2. Aqueous Layer** (Middle) | **[[Lacrimal Gland]]** (Main & Accessory),. | Bulk of tear film. Provides oxygen, nutrients, and antibacterial substances (Lysozyme, Lactoferrin, IgA),. |
| **3. Lipid Layer** (Outermost) | **[[Meibomian Glands]]**, Glands of Zeis, Glands of Moll,,. | Retards **evaporation** of tears; lubricates eyelids. |

### Secretion of Tears
*   **Basal Secretion:** Continuous secretion by accessory lacrimal glands (Krause and Wolfring),.
*   **Reflex Secretion:** Secreted by the main lacrimal gland in response to sensations from the cornea/conjunctiva or emotional stress,.
*   **Physical Properties:** Slightly alkaline (pH 7.2–7.4),. Total volume is ~7 $\mu$L.

### Mechanism of Elimination (Lacrimal Pump)
Tears are drained via the **Lacrimal Pump Mechanism** driven by the blinking of eyelids and the [[orbicularis oculi]] muscle,.

1.  **Eye Closing (Blinking):**
    *   Contraction of the *pretarsal* orbicularis oculi compresses the ampulla and shortens canaliculi, pushing tears into the sac.
    *   Contraction of the *preseptal* orbicularis ([[Horner's muscle]]) distends the lacrimal sac, creating **negative pressure**, which sucks tears from the canaliculi into the sac.
2.  **Eye Opening:**
    *   Muscles relax. The lacrimal sac collapses due to its elasticity.
    *   This creates **positive pressure**, forcing tears down the [[nasolacrimal duct]] into the nose (aided by gravity),.

**Clinical Implication:** [[Facial nerve palsy]] (CN VII) causes failure of the lacrimal pump due to orbicularis paralysis, leading to **Epiphora** (overflow of tears),.
