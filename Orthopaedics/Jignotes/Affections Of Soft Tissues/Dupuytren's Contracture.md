# Dupuytren's Contracture

### Definition
**Dupuytren’s Contracture** is a benign, progressive fibroproliferative disorder of the subcutaneous tissue of the palm, specifically the [[Palmar aponeurosis]]. It is characterized by the formation of nodules and cords that eventually result in a fixed [[Flexion deformity]] of the fingers, predominantly affecting the **Metacarpophalangeal (MCP)** and **Proximal Interphalangeal (PIP)** joints.

### Epidemiology and Etiology
The exact cause is unknown, but there is a strong genetic and hereditary predisposition. It is often referred to as **"Viking Disease"** due to its high prevalence in Northern Europeans/Scandinavians.

**Risk Factors (Mnemonics: A-G)**
*   **A**ge: Middle-aged to elderly men (40–60 years).
*   **A**ncestry: Northern European/Scandinavian.
*   **A**lcoholism: Associated with liver cirrhosis.
*   **A**IDS: Higher incidence noted.
*   **D**iabetes Mellitus.
*   **E**pilepsy: Specifically patients on **Phenytoin (Sodium Hydantoin)** therapy.
*   **G**ender: Males > Females (10:1 ratio).
*   **G**enetics: Autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance.
*   **S**moking.

### Surgical Anatomy
*   **Structure Involved:** [[Palmar aponeurosis]].
*   **Normal Anatomy:** The aponeurosis is triangular. Distally, it divides into four slips for the fingers. These slips attach to the transverse metacarpal ligament, fibrous flexor sheath, and the sides of the proximal phalanx.
*   **Crucial Point:** The aponeurosis **does not** attach to the distal phalanx. Therefore, the **Distal Interphalangeal (DIP) joint** is usually spared or may even be hyperextended due to altered mechanics.
*   **Pathological Structures:** Structures involved in the contracture include:
    *   Pretendinous bands.
    *   Spiral band (can displace the neurovascular bundle).
    *   Natatory ligament.
    *   Grayson’s ligament.
    *   Lateral digital sheet.

### Clinical Features
**Symptoms:**
*   Usually painless, insidious onset.
*   Patient notices a lump or nodule in the palm.
*   Progressive difficulty in straightening the fingers (washing face, putting hands in pockets, shaking hands).

**Signs:**
1.  **Look:**
    *   **Nodule:** Often the first sign, usually at the distal palmar crease near the ring finger.
    *   **Pitting/Puckering:** Skin adheres to the underlying fascia causing dimpling.
    *   **Cords:** Thickened fibrous bands palpable under the skin extending from palm to fingers.
    *   **Deformity:** Fixed flexion of [[Metacarpophalangeal joint]] and [[Proximal interphalangeal joint]].
    *   **Distribution:** Most commonly affects the **Ring finger**, followed by the **Little finger**. Bilateral involvement is common.
2.  **Feel:**
    *   Thickened palmar fascia.
    *   Cords become taut on passive extension attempts.
3.  **Special Test:**
    *   **Hueston’s Table Top Test:** The patient is asked to place their hand flat on a table. If the hand cannot lie completely flat due to contracture, the test is **Positive**.

### Dupuytren's Diathesis
This term refers to an aggressive form of the disease associated with a strong family history, early onset, and ectopic deposits of fibrous tissue elsewhere in the body.

| Location | Condition Name |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Palm** | [[Dupuytren's Contracture]] |
| **Dorsum of PIP Joints** | **Garrod's Pads** (Knuckle pads) |
| **Penis** | [[Peyronie's disease]] |
| **Plantar Fascia (Sole)** | [[Ledderhose disease]] |

### Differential Diagnosis

| Feature | [[Dupuytren's Contracture]] | [[Ulnar Claw Hand]] | [[Volkmann's Ischemic Contracture]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pathology** | Fibrosis of palmar fascia | Ulnar nerve paralysis (intrinsic muscle loss) | Ischemia of flexor muscles |
| **Deformity** | Flexion of MCP & PIP | Hyperextension of MCP, Flexion of IP joints | Flexion of Wrist, MCP, & IP joints |
| **Sensory Loss** | Absent | Present (Ulnar distribution) | May be present (nerve ischemia) |
| **Passive Correction** | Impossible (Fixed) | Possible (unless joint stiffness sets in) | Possible with wrist flexion (Volkmann's sign) |

### Treatment

#### 1. Conservative Management
Indicated for mild cases with no functional impairment or static deformity.
*   **Observation:** Regular follow-up.
*   **Physical Therapy:** Stretching exercises, ultrasonic radiation.
*   **Local Injection:** [[Corticosteroids]] (Hydrocortisone) into nodules.
*   **Enzymatic Fasciotomy:** Injection of **Collagenase** (*Clostridium histolyticum*) into the cord to dissolve it, followed by manipulation.

#### 2. Surgical Management
**Indications for Surgery:**
*   **Positive Table Top Test.**
*   **MCP Joint Contracture:** > 30 degrees.
*   **PIP Joint Contracture:** > 15 degrees (any degree of PIP contracture is significant as it is harder to correct).
*   Functional disability.

**Procedures:**
*   **Subcutaneous Fasciotomy:** Simply dividing the cord. High recurrence rate.
*   **Partial/Selective Fasciectomy:** *Gold Standard.* Excision of the diseased fascia through a **Z-plasty** incision (to prevent scar contracture).
*   **Dermo-fasciectomy:** Removal of skin overlying the diseased fascia (if adherent) and the fascia itself. Requires a [[Skin graft]].
*   **Amputation:** Rare; reserved for severe, recurrent cases with neurovascular compromise or a fixed, useless finger.

**Clinical Implication:** During surgery, extreme care must be taken to identify the **digital nerves and vessels**. The "spiral cord" of the fascia can displace the neurovascular bundle superficially and centrally, putting it at high risk of iatrogenic injury.

### Complications
*   **Hematoma:** Most common early complication.
*   **Skin Necrosis:** Due to thin skin flaps or vascular compromise.
*   **Digital Nerve Injury:** Causes numbness.
*   **Recurrence:** Common, especially in patients with Dupuytren's diathesis.
*   **Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (CRPS):** Post-operative stiffness and pain.
