# [[Diseases Of Cornea]] > Corneal Degenerations

### I. Introduction to Corneal Degenerations

[[Corneal degenerations]] are acquired, usually unilateral (can be bilateral), non-familial, and non-hereditary changes in the cornea. They are typically associated with aging, specific diseases, or environmental factors. They differ from [[corneal dystrophies]], which are hereditary and bilateral.

### II. Arcus Senilis (Gerontoxon)

It is the most common peripheral corneal degeneration found in the elderly.

#### 1. Etiology and Pathology
*   **Definition:** An annular infiltration of lipid material in the corneal periphery.
*   **Epidemiology:**
    *   Almost universally present in individuals >60 years of age.
    *   Occurs in 60% of persons between 40–60 years.
*   **Pathology:**
    *   Deposition of **lipids** (cholesterol, phospholipids, and neutral fats) in the [[corneal stroma]] and [[Descemet's membrane]].
    *   The deposition starts first in the deep layers of the substantia propria and then in the Bowman’s layer.

#### 2. Clinical Features
*   **Appearance:**
    *   Starts as a crescentic grey or white line in the superior and inferior margins of the cornea.
    *   Eventually, the extremities meet to form a complete opaque ring around the cornea.
    *   The opacity is wider vertically (superior and inferior) than horizontally.
*   **Lucid Interval of Vogt:** A characteristic clear zone of cornea (approx. 1 mm wide) separates the lipid ring from the [[limbus]].
    *   This interval exists because the perilimbal capillaries clear the lipid deposits in that immediate area.
*   **Margins:** The peripheral margin is sharp/well-defined, while the central margin is diffuse (fades off).

#### 3. Clinical Implications and Management
*   **Vision:** It never encroaches on the pupillary area; therefore, it does **not** affect vision.
*   **Vitality:** It does not affect the vitality of the cornea.
*   **Systemic Association:** In elderly patients, it is an age-related change and not necessarily associated with hypercholesterolemia.
*   **Treatment:** No treatment is required.

#### 4. Arcus Juvenilis (Anterior Embryotoxon)
*   If [[Arcus Senilis]] appears in young individuals (<40 years), it is termed **Arcus Juvenilis**.
*   **Significance:** It implies a hereditary anomaly or metabolic disorder.
*   **Management:** A **serum lipid profile** is mandatory to rule out hyperlipoproteinemia/hypercholesterolemia, as it carries a serious prognosis for life (cardiovascular risks).
*   **Association:** Can be seen in [[Alport's syndrome]].

### III. Band Shaped Keratopathy (BSK)

A degenerative condition characterized by the deposition of calcium salts in the anterior layers of the cornea.

#### 1. Etiology
Can be classified into ocular and systemic causes.

**A. Ocular Causes (Chronic Disease):**
*   **Chronic [[Uveitis]]**: Especially in children with [[Still's disease]] (Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis - JRA).
*   **Blind Shrunken Eyes**: [[Phthisis bulbi]].
*   **Silicone Oil**: In aphakic eyes post-vitrectomy if oil remains for a long duration.
*   **Chronic [[Glaucoma]]**.
*   **Chronic [[Keratitis]]**.

**B. Systemic/Metabolic Causes (Hypercalcemia):**
*   [[Hyperparathyroidism]].
*   **Vitamin D poisoning**.
*   [[Sarcoidosis]].
*   **Renal Failure**: Chronic renal failure, hyperphosphatemia.
*   Milk-alkali syndrome.

#### 2. Pathology
*   Deposition of **calcium salts** (hydroxyapatite).
*   **Location:**
    *   [[Bowman's membrane]].
    *   Sub-epithelial space.
    *   Superficial stroma.

#### 3. Clinical Features
*   **Location:** Typically in the **interpalpebral zone** (the area exposed within the palpebral fissure).
*   **Progression:** Starts at the periphery (3 and 9 o'clock positions) and progresses centrally to form a continuous band.
*   **Appearance:**
    *   Whitish or greyish band across the cornea.
    *   **Swiss Cheese Appearance:** The surface is stippled with small holes. These "holes" represent corneal nerve canals penetrating Bowman's layer where calcium cannot deposit.
    *   **Clear Interval:** Similar to Arcus Senilis, a clear interval usually exists between the calcific band and the limbus.

#### 4. Symptoms
*   Initially asymptomatic.
*   **Vision:** Decrease in vision if the band encroaches the pupillary area.
*   **Discomfort:** Foreign body sensation, irritation, and lacrimation if the overlying epithelium breaks down or becomes irregular.

#### 5. Management
*   **Treat the Underlying Cause:** Manage hypercalcemia or ocular inflammation.
*   **Chelation (Chemical Removal):** This is the standard treatment.
    1.  Topical anesthesia.
    2.  Mechanical scraping/debridement of the corneal epithelium.
    3.  Application of a chelating agent: **[[Disodium EDTA]]** (0.01 to 0.05 Molar solution) or **Sodium Versenate**.
    4.  The calcium dissolves; the eye is then patched to allow re-epithelialization.
*   **Surgical Options:**
    *   **[[Phototherapeutic Keratectomy]] (PTK):** Using Excimer laser to ablate the superficial calcium.
    *   **Lamellar [[Keratoplasty]]:** For deep or recurrent cases obscuring vision.
