# Perforating and Penetrating Ocular Injuries

### Definitions and Terminology
It is crucial to differentiate between the types of open globe injuries based on the nature of the wound and the agent involved.

| Term | Definition | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Open-globe injury]]** | A full-thickness wound of the eyewall ([[sclera]] or [[cornea]]). | Can be a rupture (blunt) or laceration (sharp). |
| **[[Penetrating injury]]** | A single full-thickness wound of the eyewall caused by a sharp object. | The object traverses the coats only once (Entry wound only). |
| **[[Perforating injury]]** | Two full-thickness wounds of the eyewall caused by the same sharp object or missile. | Has both an **Entry** and an **Exit** wound. |
| **[[Intraocular Foreign Body]] (IOFB)** | Technically a penetrating injury associated with the retention of a foreign object. | Grouped separately due to specific clinical implications. |

### Modes of Injury
*   **Sharp Instruments:** Needles, knives, nails, arrows, pens, glass pieces.
*   **High-Speed Missiles:** Bullet injuries, iron foreign bodies in lathe workers.

### Mechanisms of Damage
Damage to ocular structures occurs via the following mechanisms:
1.  **Mechanical Effects:** Direct physical disruption of tissues (cornea, sclera, lens, retina).
2.  **Introduction of Infection:** Pyogenic organisms enter the eye, leading to [[ring abscess]], [[purulent iridocyclitis]], [[endophthalmitis]], or [[panophthalmitis]].
    *   Rarely, [[tetanus]] or gas-forming organisms (*Clostridium welchii*) may infect the eye.
3.  **Post-traumatic [[Iridocyclitis]]:** Frequent occurrence; if untreated, can cause devastating damage.
4.  **[[Sympathetic Ophthalmitis]]:** A serious autoimmune granulomatous panuveitis in the sound eye.

### Management of Specific Tissue Injuries

#### 1. Conjunctival Wounds
*   Usually associated with [[subconjunctival haemorrhage]].
*   **Treatment:** Wounds > 3 mm should be sutured.

#### 2. Corneal Wounds
These are categorized based on the involvement of intraocular contents.

**A. Uncomplicated Corneal Wounds**
*   **Definition:** Not associated with prolapse of intraocular contents.
*   **Pathology:** Wound margins swell, leading to automatic sealing and restoration of the [[anterior chamber]].
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Small central wound (< 2 mm): Does not need stitching. Treat with pad and bandage, [[atropine]], and antibiotic ointments.
    *   Large wound (> 2 mm): Must be sutured.

**B. Complicated Corneal Wounds**
*   **Definition:** Associated with prolapse of [[iris]], and sometimes lens matter or [[vitreous]].
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Iris Prolapse:** Meticulous suturing is required after **abscising** (cutting) the prolapsed iris.
    *   **Clinical Pearl:** **Never reposit the prolapsed iris** in a penetrating injury as it may introduce infection into the eye.
    *   **Vitreous/Lens Involvement:** [[Lensectomy]] and [[anterior vitrectomy]] may be performed along with wound repair.

#### 3. Scleral Wounds
*   Usually associated with corneal wounds.
*   **Treatment:** In a corneoscleral tear, the **first suture should be applied at the [[limbus]]** to restore anatomical alignment.

#### 4. Lens Injuries
*   Small anterior capsule wounds may seal, leading to [[traumatic cataract]] (localized stationary, rosette, or total cataract).
*   **Treatment:** General lines of cataract management (ECCE/Phacoemulsification). Extensive rupture requires lensectomy.

#### 5. Severely Wounded Eye
*   **Definition:** Extensive corneo-scleral tears with prolapse of uveal tissue, lens rupture, vitreous loss, and retinal/choroidal damage.
*   **Management:** If there is no chance of useful vision, **primary excision** (enucleation/evisceration) is preferred to prevent sympathetic ophthalmitis.

### Intraocular Foreign Bodies (IOFB)

**Common Agents:** Iron/steel (90%), glass, stone, lead pellets, copper, wood.
**Note:** In injuries involving a hammer and chisel, the foreign body is usually a chip of the **chisel** (iron), not the stone.

#### Tissue Reactions to IOFB
The reaction depends on the chemical nature of the object:
1.  **No Reaction (Inert):** Glass, plastic, gold, silver, platinum.
2.  **Local Irritative Reaction (Encapsulation):** Lead, aluminium.
3.  **Suppurative Reaction:** Pure copper, zinc, nickel, mercury.
4.  **Specific Reactions:**
    *   **[[Siderosis Bulbi]]** (Iron).
    *   **[[Chalcosis]]** (Copper alloys).

#### Siderosis Bulbi
Degenerative changes caused by an iron foreign body, typically occurring 2 months to 2 years post-injury.
*   **Pathogenesis:** Iron undergoes electrolytic dissociation; ions disseminate and combine with intracellular proteins, causing degeneration of epithelial structures.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Lens:** Rusty deposits ("rust ring") on the anterior capsule/epithelium.
    *   **Iris:** [[Heterochromia iridis]] (affected iris becomes darker/rusty).
    *   **Retina:** Pigmentary degeneration (blindness).
    *   **Secondary Glaucoma:** Chronic open-angle glaucoma.

#### Diagnosis and Localization of IOFB
1.  **History & Slit Lamp:** Look for a hole in the iris or an opaque track in the lens.
2.  **Plain X-ray:** Useful for radio-opaque FBs. The **Limbal Ring Method** was historically used for localization.
3.  **[[CT Scan]] (Computed Tomography):** Currently the **gold standard/best method** for localization. It provides cross-sectional images superior to plain X-rays and USG.
4.  **[[Ultrasonography]] (USG):** Useful for non-radio-opaque FBs and detecting retinal detachment, but requires a skilled operator.
5.  **[[MRI]] (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):**
    *   **Contraindication:** Absolutely contraindicated if a **metallic/magnetic** foreign body is suspected (can cause movement of the FB and further damage).
    *   **Use:** Only for wood/plastic FBs *after* CT has excluded metal.

#### Management of IOFB
IOFBs should almost always be removed unless inert and carrying high surgical risk.
*   **Magnetic FB Removal:**
    *   **Anterior Chamber:** Removed via corneal incision using a hand-held magnet.
    *   **Vitreous/Retina:** Removed via **[[Pars Plana Vitrectomy]] (PPV)** with an internal magnet or forceps. External magnet extraction is less favored now.
*   **Non-Magnetic FB Removal:** Requires forceps removal via pars plana vitrectomy.

### Sympathetic Ophthalmitis
A rare, bilateral, granulomatous [[panuveitis]] following penetrating trauma to one eye (Exciting Eye), affecting the sound eye (Sympathizing Eye).

*   **Etiology:** Autoimmune reaction against uveal pigment/retinal antigens.
*   **Predisposing Factors:**
    *   Penetrating wounds, especially in the **ciliary region ("Dangerous Zone")**.
    *   Wounds with incarceration of uveal tissue.
    *   More common in children.
    *   Does *not* typically occur if the injured eye develops suppuration (pus).
*   **Timing:** Usually 4–8 weeks after injury. Almost always within the first year.
*   **Clinical Features (Sympathizing Eye):**
    *   *Prodromal:* Photophobia, transient blurring of near vision (accommodation failure), retrolental flare.
    *   *Developed:* Acute plastic iridocyclitis, **[[Dalen-Fuchs nodules]]** (epithelioid cells between RPE and Bruch's membrane).
*   **Prevention:**
    *   **Early Enucleation** of the injured eye (within 2 weeks) is the only sure prophylaxis if visual prognosis is nil.
    *   Meticulous repair of the wound without uveal incarceration.
