# Choroidal Tumours

## 1. Malignant Melanoma of the Choroid

**[[Malignant melanoma]]** of the choroid is the most common **primary** intraocular malignancy in adults. It arises from the neural crest-derived pigment cells (dendritic melanocytes) of the uvea.

### Epidemiology and Risk Factors
*   **Age:** Typically occurs between 40–70 years.
*   **Race:** More common in Whites; rare in Blacks and Asians.
*   **Laterality:** Almost always **unilateral** and single.
*   **Risk Factors:** Ocular melanocytosis, neurofibromatosis, and pre-existing [[choroidal nevus]].

### Pathology (Modified Callender's Classification)
Histopathologically, tumors are classified based on cell type, which determines prognosis:

| Cell Type | Description | Prognosis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Spindle A** | Slender spindle cells, flattened nucleus, no nucleolus. | Best Prognosis (80% 10-yr survival). |
| **Spindle B** | Larger spindle cells, prominent nucleolus. | Intermediate. |
| **Epithelioid** | Large, pleomorphic cells, high mitotic activity. | **Worst Prognosis** (35% 10-yr survival). |
| **Mixed** | Combination of spindle and epithelioid cells. | Intermediate (45% 10-yr survival). |
| **Necrotic** | Predominant cell type unrecognizable due to necrosis. | Variable. |

> **Clinical Implication:** The presence of epithelioid cells, high mitotic activity, and extrascleral extension are indicators of poor prognosis.

### Growth Pattern
1.  **Initial Growth:** Starts as a lens-shaped mass in the outer choroid.
2.  **Bruch's Membrane Rupture:** As the tumor grows, it stretches and eventually ruptures [[Bruch's membrane]].
3.  **Mushroom/Collar-Stud Shape:** The tumor proliferates through the rupture into the subretinal space, forming a globular mass with a narrow neck, giving it a characteristic **Mushroom** or **Collar-stud appearance**.
4.  **Diffuse Type:** Rare (5%); spreads laterally thickening the choroid without forming a distinct mass.

### Clinical Stages
The natural history is classically divided into four stages:

1.  **Quiescent Stage:**
    *   May be asymptomatic or cause visual field defects/floaters.
    *   **Signs:** Elevated pigmented oval mass. **Orange pigment (lipofuscin)** on the surface is a pathognomonic sign of activity.
    *   **Exudative Retinal Detachment:** Fluid accumulates due to vascular leakage.

2.  **Glaucomatous Stage:**
    *   Due to venous stasis (pressure on vortex veins) or forward displacement of the lens-iris diaphragm causing [[secondary angle closure glaucoma]].
    *   Can present as a painful red eye.

3.  **Stage of Extraocular Extension:**
    *   Tumor bursts through the sclera (commonly along emissaria of vortex veins/ciliary vessels) leading to proptosis.

4.  **Stage of Distant Metastasis:**
    *   Spread is primarily **hematogenous**.
    *   Most common site: **[[Liver]]**.
    *   Lymphatic spread is rare (unless conjunctival extension occurs).

### Investigations
1.  **Indirect Ophthalmoscopy:** Visualizes the mass and associated exudative [[retinal detachment]] (shifting fluid).
2.  **Ultrasonography (USG) (IOC):**
    *   **A-Scan:** Low internal reflectivity (due to homogenous cells) and a high spike at the scleral wall (Kappa angle).
    *   **B-Scan:**
        *   **Acoustic Hollowing:** Tumor appears dark internally.
        *   **Choroidal Excavation:** Tumor replaces choroid.
        *   **Mushroom/Collar-stud configuration**.
3.  **Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA):**
    *   Shows **"Double Circulation"** (simultaneous visualization of retinal and choroidal/tumor vessels).
4.  **Transillumination:** The tumor is opaque to light (unlike simple serous cysts/detachments).

### Treatment
Management depends on tumor size, location, and status of the other eye.

*   **Observation:** For small, asymptomatic tumors (<2mm thick).
*   **Brachytherapy (Plaque Radiotherapy):**
    *   Uses radioactive plaques (Iodine-125, Cobalt-60, Ruthenium-106) sutured to the sclera.
    *   Indicated for small/medium tumors (<10mm elevation).
*   **Transpupillary Thermotherapy (TTT):** Uses diode laser for small posterior tumors.
*   **Charged Particle Irradiation:** Proton beam therapy.
*   **Enucleation:**
    *   Removal of the entire eyeball.
    *   Indicated for large tumors (>16mm diameter/>10mm height), optic nerve invasion, or painful blind eyes.
*   **Exenteration:** Required if there is massive extraocular extension into the orbit.

## 2. Secondary (Metastatic) Carcinoma of the Choroid

These are the most common intraocular tumors overall (more common than primary melanoma), though often asymptomatic.

### Etiology and Primary Sites
*   Spread is via the bloodstream (hematogenous).
*   **Females:** Most common primary site is **[[Breast Carcinoma]]**.
*   **Males:** Most common primary site is **[[Lung Carcinoma]]** or Bronchogenic carcinoma.
*   Other sites: GI tract, kidney, prostate, thyroid.

### Clinical Features
1.  **Laterality:** Frequently **bilateral** and multiple.
2.  **Location:** Predilection for the **posterior pole** (due to high vascularity).
3.  **Appearance:**
    *   Flat or slightly elevated.
    *   Creamy-yellow or greyish in color ("placoid" appearance).
    *   Associated with a disproportionately large, shallow **exudative retinal detachment**.
    *   Typically grows rapidly compared to melanoma.

### Treatment
Since the patient often has widespread systemic metastasis, treatment is palliative intended to preserve vision and prevent pain.

*   **Radiotherapy:** Most metastatic carcinomas are **radiosensitive**. External beam radiotherapy is the mainstay.
*   **Chemotherapy/Hormone Therapy:** Systemic treatment for the primary tumor (e.g., breast cancer) often leads to regression of choroidal deposits.
*   **Enucleation:** Generally **contraindicated** unless the eye is blind and painful (secondary glaucoma), as life expectancy is limited.
