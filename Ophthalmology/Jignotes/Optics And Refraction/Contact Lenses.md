# Contact Lenses

[[Contact lens]] is a thin, optical corrective device consisting of a polymer wafer designed to rest directly on the surface of the [[cornea]] or [[sclera]]. It serves as an alternative to [[spectacles]] for correcting [[refractive errors]] and treating ocular surface diseases.

### Optical Principles and Nomenclature

Contact lenses function by altering the vergence of light rays before they reach the eye. They effectively replace the anterior surface of the cornea as the primary refracting surface.

**Key Parameters:**
1.  **Overall Diameter (OD):** The linear measurement of the greatest distance across the physical boundaries.
2.  **Optic Zone Diameter (OZ):** The central zone responsible for focusing rays on the [[retina]].
3.  **Base Curve (BC):** The curvature of the posterior surface of the lens, designed to fit the anterior corneal curvature.
4.  **Power:** Measured in [[diopters]] (D).
5.  **Oxygen Permeability ($Dk$):**
    *   $D$: Diffusion coefficient.
    *   $k$: Solubility coefficient.
    *   **$Dk/t$ (Oxygen Transmissibility):** $t$ is the thickness of the lens. This determines how much oxygen reaches the cornea.

**Physiological Impact:**
*   **Glucose Supply:** The cornea derives glucose from the [[aqueous humor]] and limbal vessels. Contact lens wear **does not** significantly affect glucose supply.
*   **Oxygen Supply:** The cornea derives oxygen primarily from the atmosphere through the [[tear film]]. Contact lenses act as a barrier to atmospheric oxygen.
*   **Metabolic Shift:** Hypoxia caused by low $Dk/t$ lenses shifts corneal metabolism from aerobic to anaerobic, leading to lactate accumulation and [[corneal edema]].

### Classification and Materials

Contact lenses are broadly classified based on their material properties into Hard, Rigid Gas Permeable (RGP), and Soft lenses.

| Feature | Hard Lenses | Rigid Gas Permeable (RGP) | Soft Lenses |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Material** | [[Polymethylmethacrylate]] (PMMA) | Copolymer of PMMA + Silicone + Cellulose Acetate Butyrate (CAB) | [[Hydroxyethyl methacrylate]] (HEMA) / Hydrogel / Silicone Hydrogel |
| **Oxygen Permeability** | Impermeable to gas ($Dk = 0$) | Good oxygen permeability | High oxygen permeability (especially Silicone Hydrogel) |
| **Durability** | Very durable | Durable | Fragile, can tear or crack |
| **Comfort** | Poor initially (requires adaptation) | Moderate (better than PMMA) | Excellent initial comfort |
| **Visual Quality** | Excellent, crisp vision | Excellent, sharper than soft lenses | Good, but may fluctuate with blink/hydration |
| **Astigmatism** | Corrects up to 4D (tear film fills irregularities) | Corrects corneal astigmatism effectively | Spherical lenses correct minimal astigmatism; [[Toric contact lens]] needed for >1D |
| **Deposits** | Resistant | Resistant | Prone to protein/lipid deposits |
| **Infection Risk** | Low | Low | Higher (due to porosity and handling) |

**Specialized Lenses:**
*   **Toric Lenses:** Used for correcting [[astigmatism]] >1.5D.
*   **X-Chrom Lenses:** Red-tinted lenses (usually monocular) to assist patients with [[color blindness]].
*   **Orthokeratology (Ortho-K):** Reverse geometry RGP lenses worn overnight to flatten the central cornea and temporarily correct [[myopia]].

### Indications

**1. Optical Indications**
*   **[[Anisometropia]]:** Reduces aniseikonia (image size difference) caused by spectacles.
*   **Unilateral [[Aphakia]]:** Reduces magnification difference (Spectacles cause ~30% magnification, CL causes ~5%). Eliminates diplopia.
*   **High [[Myopia]]:** Provides larger field of vision and avoids minification of the image caused by strong concave spectacle lenses.
*   **[[Keratoconus]]:** RGP lenses mask irregular astigmatism by creating a new, smooth refractive surface (tear lens effect).
*   **Irregular [[Astigmatism]]:** Due to corneal scars or trauma.

**2. Therapeutic (Bandage Contact Lenses)**
*   **Bullous Keratopathy:** Relieves pain by covering exposed nerve endings.
*   **Non-healing [[Corneal ulcer]]:** Promotes re-epithelialization.
*   **Recurrent Corneal Erosion Syndrome.**
*   **Small corneal perforations:** Acts as a splint (often with cyanoacrylate glue).
*   **[[Entropion]] / [[Trichiasis]]:** Protects cornea from rubbing lashes.

**3. Cosmetic & Prosthetic**
*   To mask corneal scars (colored lenses).
*   [[Aniridia]] (lenses with artificial iris).
*   Albinism (to reduce glare).

**4. Diagnostic**
*   Used in [[Gonioscopy]] (e.g., Goldmann lens).
*   [[Electroretinography]] (ERG).
*   Fundus photography.

**5. Occupational**
*   Sportsmen, pilots, actors (where spectacles are inconvenient).

### Assessment and Fitting

**Pre-fitting Evaluation:**
1.  **Slit-lamp Examination:** To rule out active inflammation, dry eye, or blepharitis.
2.  **[[Keratometry]]:** Measures anterior corneal curvature (K1 and K2) to determine the Base Curve.
3.  **Refraction:** To determine power.
4.  **Tear Film Assessment:** [[Schirmer's test]] and Tear Break-up Time (TBUT).

**Fitting Assessment (Fluorescein Pattern):**
Used primarily for RGP/Hard lenses. High molecular weight fluorescein (Fluorexon) is used for soft lenses to avoid permanent staining.

*   **Ideal Fit:** Even distribution of fluorescein. "Three-point touch" (apex and mid-periphery). Movement of 1-1.5 mm with blinking.
*   **Steep Fit (Tight):** Central pooling of fluorescein (green zone) with mid-peripheral bearing. Little to no movement. Bubble may be trapped centrally.
*   **Flat Fit (Loose):** Central touch (dark area/absence of dye) with peripheral pooling. Excessive movement. Lens may de-center.

**Clinical Implication:** A steep fit can cause corneal hypoxia and edema due to tear stagnation. A flat fit can cause mechanical abrasion and instability.

### Complications of Contact Lenses

**1. Infectious**
*   **Microbial [[Keratitis]]:** Most serious complication.
    *   **Bacterial:** *[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]* is the most common organism (especially in soft CL).
    *   **Protozoal:** *[[Acanthamoeba]] keratitis* (Associated with using tap water/swimming/homemade saline). Characterized by severe pain disproportionate to signs, ring infiltrate, and perineural infiltrates.
    *   **Fungal:** *Fusarium* or *Aspergillus*.

**2. Hypoxic / Metabolic**
*   **Corneal Edema:** Epithelial microcysts, stromal haze.
*   **Neovascularization:** Ingrowth of limbal vessels into the cornea (pannus) due to chronic hypoxia.
*   **Polymegathism:** Variation in endothelial cell size.

**3. Allergic / Toxic / Inflammatory**
*   **[[Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis]] (GPC):** Type I and IV hypersensitivity to protein deposits on the lens. Features large papillae (>0.3mm) on upper tarsal conjunctiva, itching, and mucus discharge.
*   **Contact Lens Induced Acute Red Eye (CLARE):** Inflammatory reaction to endotoxins from gram-negative bacteria (while sleeping in lenses).
*   **Solution Toxicity:** Reaction to preservatives (e.g., thimerosal, benzalkonium chloride) causing [[Superficial Punctate Keratitis]] (SPK).

**4. Mechanical**
*   **Corneal Abrasions.**
*   **Superior Epithelial Arcuate Lesion (SEAL):** Epithelial splitting due to tight upper lid pressure.
*   **Corneal Warpage:** Change in corneal curvature due to long-term RGP wear.
