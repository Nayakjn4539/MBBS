# [[Nose]] > Etiology and Management of Epistaxis

# Etiology and Management of Epistaxis

[[Epistaxis]] is defined as bleeding from the nasal cavity or nasopharynx. It is a common clinical condition with a bimodal age distribution, peaking in children (under 10 years) and older adults (over 50 years). It is a sign, not a disease per se.

## Surgical Anatomy of Epistaxis

Understanding the vascular supply is crucial for management. The nose is supplied by both the **Internal Carotid Artery (ICA)** and **External Carotid Artery (ECA)** systems,.

### 1. Little’s Area ([[Kiesselbach’s Plexus]])
Situated in the anteroinferior part of the nasal septum. It is the most common site of epistaxis (90% of cases), especially in children and young adults,.
It is an anastomotic site of four arteries (Mnemonic: **LEGS**):
1.  **L** - Superior **L**abial artery (Septal branch from Facial artery - ECA).
2.  **E** - Anterior **E**thmoidal artery (branch of Ophthalmic artery - ICA).
3.  **G** - **G**reater Palatine artery (branch of Maxillary artery - ECA).
4.  **S** - **S**phenopalatine artery (Septal branch from Maxillary artery - ECA).

> **Clinical Implication:** This area is exposed to the drying effect of inspiratory air currents and digital trauma (nose picking), making it prone to bleeding.

### 2. [[Woodruff’s Plexus]]
*   **Location:** Lateral wall of the nose, inferior to the posterior end of the [[inferior turbinate]],.
*   **Nature:** It is a venous plexus.
*   **Significance:** Common site for posterior epistaxis in adults, often associated with hypertension,.

### 3. Retrocolumellar Vein
*   Runs vertically downwards behind the columella.
*   Common site of venous bleeding in young people,.

## Classification of Epistaxis

Epistaxis is clinically classified based on the site of bleeding,.

| Feature | **Anterior Epistaxis** | **Posterior Epistaxis** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Incidence** | More common (80–90%) | Less common |
| **Site** | [[Little's Area]] or anterior lateral wall | Posterosuperior nasal cavity or [[Woodruff's Plexus]], |
| **Age** | Children and young adults | Patients > 40 years |
| **Cause** | Mostly trauma (nose picking) | Spontaneous; often Hypertension or Arteriosclerosis |
| **Presentation** | Blood flows out from the front of the nose | Blood flows back into the throat (may cause "coffee-colored" vomiting) |
| **Management** | Often controlled by local pressure/anterior packing | Difficult to localize; often requires hospitalization and posterior packing |

## Etiology (Causes)

Causes are broadly divided into Local and General (Systemic) factors.

### A. Local Causes
1.  **Trauma (Most Common):**
    *   **Nose picking (Digital trauma):** Most common cause in children,.
    *   **Trauma to nose/face:** Fractures of nasal bones or septum.
    *   **Iatrogenic:** Nasal surgery (e.g., FESS, Septoplasty), Nasogastric intubation, Nasotracheal intubation.
    *   **Foreign Bodies:** Especially in children; presents with unilateral foul-smelling discharge and bleeding.
2.  **Infections:**
    *   Acute: Viral rhinitis, Diphtheria, Acute sinusitis.
    *   Chronic: Crust-forming diseases like Atrophic rhinitis, Tuberculosis, Syphilis,.
    *   Fungal: Rhinosporidiosis (bleeding polyp).
3.  **Tumors:**
    *   Benign: **[[Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma]]** (Recurrent, profuse epistaxis in adolescent males),.
    *   Malignant: SCC, Esthesioneuroblastoma.
4.  **Anatomical Abnormalities:**
    *   **Deviated Nasal Septum ([[DNS]]):** Spurs cause eddy currents leading to mucosal dryness and crusting.
    *   **Septal Perforation:** Crusting at margins causes bleeding.
5.  **Drugs (Topical):** Prolonged use of steroid sprays or decongestants.

### B. Systemic (General) Causes
1.  **Cardiovascular:**
    *   **[[Hypertension]]:** Common in elderly. It is rarely a direct cause but makes bleeding difficult to control and prolongs it due to vascular fragility,.
2.  **Coagulopathies:**
    *   Hemophilia, Leukemia, Thrombocytopenia, Vitamin K deficiency (Liver disease),.
    *   **Dengue hemorrhagic fever**.
3.  **Drugs (Systemic):**
    *   Aspirin, NSAIDs, Anticoagulants (Warfarin, Heparin),.
4.  **Hereditary:**
    *   **[[Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia]] (Osler-Weber-Rendu Syndrome):** Autosomal dominant condition causing recurrent bleeding from vascular anomalies,.
5.  **Physiological:**
    *   Vicarious menstruation.
    *   High altitude.

## Management of Epistaxis

The protocol follows a stepwise escalation from first aid to surgical intervention.

### 1. First Aid (Immediate Measure)
*   **[[Trotter's Method]] / Hippocratic Method:**
    *   **Position:** Patient sits leaning forward (to prevent blood swallowing and aspiration),.
    *   **Action:** Pinch the soft cartilaginous part of the nose tightly for **10–15 minutes** (compresses vessels of Little's area),.
    *   **Breathing:** Through the open mouth.
    *   **Cold Compress:** Ice packs on the bridge of the nose to cause reflex vasoconstriction,.

### 2. Assessment and Resuscitation
*   **ABC:** Assess Airway, Breathing, and Circulation.
*   **Resuscitation:** IV access, fluids, and blood transfusion if signs of shock (Class III/IV hemorrhage),.
*   **History:** Ask about trauma, hypertension, medications (antiplatelets/anticoagulants), and family history.
*   **Examination:** Anterior rhinoscopy and **[[Diagnostic Nasal Endoscopy]]** to localize the bleeding point. Suction clots to visualize the area.

### 3. Cauterization
Indicated when a specific bleeding point is identified (usually anterior).
*   **Chemical Cautery:** Using **Silver Nitrate** sticks (AgNO3) on the bleeding point for a few seconds. Area must be anaesthetized first,.
*   **Electrocautery:** Bipolar cautery is preferred to avoid damage to the septum or optic nerve (monopolar is dangerous),.

### 4. Anterior Nasal Packing
Indicated if cautery fails or bleeding is profuse/diffuse and the site cannot be localized,.
*   **Material:**
    *   Ribbon gauze impregnated with antibiotic ointment/liquid paraffin/BIPP (Bismuth Iodoform Paraffin Paste),.
    *   **[[Merocel]]** (compressed sponge that expands when wet).
    *   Balloon tamponade.
*   **Technique:** Layered packing from the floor upwards (horizontal layers).
*   **Duration:** Left in situ for **24–72 hours**,.
*   **Antibiotic Cover:** Mandatory to prevent Sinusitis and **[[Toxic Shock Syndrome]]**,.

### 5. Posterior Nasal Packing
Indicated for posterior epistaxis (blood dripping into throat despite anterior pack).
*   **Methods:**
    *   **Foley’s Catheter:** Size 12–14F. Inserted into the nose, balloon inflated with 5–10 ml saline in the nasopharynx, and pulled forward to block the choana,,.
    *   **Gauze Pack:** Cone-shaped gauze tied with silk threads, inserted via the mouth and pulled into the nasopharynx using catheters.
    *   **Nasal Balloons:** Double balloon systems (one for postnasal space, one for nasal cavity).
*   **Precaution:** Patient requires hospitalization and monitoring of oxygen saturation (risk of nasopulmonary reflex causing hypoxia).

### 6. Surgical Intervention
Used when packing fails (Refractory Epistaxis).
1.  **Transnasal Endoscopic Sphenopalatine Artery Ligation ([[TESPAL]]):**
    *   **Procedure of Choice** for posterior epistaxis,.
    *   The **[[Sphenopalatine Artery]]** is ligated as it exits the sphenopalatine foramen (located posterior to the middle turbinate),.
2.  **Anterior/Posterior Ethmoidal Artery Ligation:**
    *   Done for bleeds above the middle turbinate (traumatic epistaxis).
    *   Approach: External (Lynch-Howarth incision) or Endoscopic,.
3.  **Internal Maxillary Artery Ligation:**
    *   Historically done via **Caldwell-Luc** approach (transantral). Now largely replaced by TESPAL.
4.  **External Carotid Artery Ligation:**
    *   Ligated in the neck above the superior thyroid artery. Rarely done now,.

### 7. Embolization
*   Performed by interventional radiologist via femoral artery catheterization.
*   Highly effective (success >80%) for inaccessible bleeds.
*   **Risk:** Stroke, facial pain.

### 8. Management of Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia ([[HHT]])
*   **Septodermoplasty:** Anterior septal mucosa excised and replaced with a skin graft.
*   **Young’s Operation:** Surgical closure of nostrils to prevent air entry and crusting (allows mucosa to heal).
*   Laser photocoagulation.
