# [[Lower Limb]] > Patella Fracture

# Fracture of Patella

### Introduction and Anatomy
The **patella** (knee cap) is the largest [[sesamoid bone]] in the body, situated within the [[quadriceps tendon]].
*   **Functions:**
    *   Increases the mechanical advantage of the [[quadriceps muscle]] by acting as a pulley and increasing the moment arm.
    *   Centralizes the divergent forces of the four quadriceps muscles.
    *   Protects the [[femoral condyle]] and knee joint from direct trauma.
    *   Provides cosmetic shape to the knee.

### Mechanism of Injury
Fractures occur through direct or indirect forces, or a combination of both.

| Mechanism | Description | Typical Fracture Pattern |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Direct Trauma** | A direct blow to the front of the knee (e.g., dashboard injury in RTA or a fall onto the knee). | [[Comminuted fracture]] or [[Stellate fracture]]. |
| **Indirect Trauma** | Sudden, violent contraction of the [[quadriceps muscle]] against resistance (e.g., stumbling or slipping). The knee is semi-flexed, and the quadriceps snaps the bone over the femoral condyles. | [[Transverse fracture]] (Two-part fracture). |
| **Combined** | Direct trauma causes the break, and muscle contraction pulls fragments apart. | Displaced comminuted fracture. |

**Clinical Implication:** In indirect injuries (transverse fractures), the [[patellar retinaculum]] is often torn, leading to separation of fragments and loss of active extension. In direct injuries (stellate), the retinaculum may remain intact, keeping fragments in place.

### Classification
Fractures are classified based on the geometry of the fracture line:
1.  **Transverse Fracture:** Most common; usually indirect trauma.
2.  **Comminuted/Stellate Fracture:** "Star-shaped"; usually direct trauma.
3.  **Longitudinal/Vertical Fracture:** Often undisplaced; difficult to diagnose clinically.
4.  **Polar Fracture (Avulsion):** Fracture of the superior or inferior pole.

---

### Clinical Features
**Symptoms**
*   History of trauma (slip/fall or direct blow).
*   Pain and swelling over the anterior aspect of the knee.
*   Inability to extend the knee or lift the leg (if the extensor mechanism is disrupted).

**Signs (Look, Feel, Move)**
*   **Look:** Swelling due to [[hemarthrosis]] (blood in the joint). Bruising may be present in direct trauma.
*   **Feel:**
    *    tenderness over the patella.
    *   A palpable gap (sulcus) may be felt between fragments in displaced fractures.
    *   **Patellar tap test** may be positive due to effusion/hemarthrosis.
*   **Move:**
    *   **Extensor Lag:** The patient cannot actively extend the knee or perform a straight leg raise against gravity, though passive extension is normal. This indicates disruption of the [[extensor mechanism]].

### Diagnostic Imaging
*   **X-rays:**
    *   **AP View:** Shows fracture lines.
    *   **Lateral View:** Best for assessing the fracture type and degree of displacement.
    *   **Skyline View (Axial View):** Useful to detect vertical fractures or osteochondral defects.
*   **MRI:** Useful for assessing cartilage damage or ligamentous injury but rarely needed for diagnosis.

**Differential Diagnosis: [[Bipartite Patella]]**
*   A congenital condition where the patella fails to fuse (accessory ossification center).
*   **Characteristics:** Usually located at the **superolateral pole**, has smooth cortical margins (unlike jagged fracture lines), and is often bilateral. It is usually painless and an incidental finding.

### Management
The key determinant for treatment is the integrity of the **extensor mechanism** and the congruity of the articular surface.

#### 1. Conservative Management
*   **Indications:**
    *   Undisplaced or minimally displaced fractures (< 2mm gap).
    *   Intact extensor mechanism (patient can perform active straight leg raise).
    *   Minimal articular step-off (< 1-2mm).
*   **Method:**
    *   Aspiration of [[hemarthrosis]] if tense and painful (under strict asepsis).
    *   Immobilization in a **Cylinder Cast** (tube cast) extending from groin to malleoli with the knee in extension for 4–6 weeks.
    *   **Rehabilitation:** Isometric quadriceps exercises are started immediately to prevent wasting.

#### 2. Operative Management
*   **Indications:**
    *   Displaced fractures (gap > 3mm, step-off > 2mm).
    *   Disruption of the extensor mechanism (failure of active extension).
    *   Open fractures.
    *   Comminuted fractures with articular incongruity.

**Surgical Techniques:**

| Technique | Indication | Procedure Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Tension Band Wiring]] (TBW)** | Transverse fractures (Most common fixation method). | Two parallel [[K-wires]] are passed vertically through the fragments. A flexible stainless steel wire is looped around them in a Figure-of-8 pattern. This converts distraction forces (from quads) into compression forces at the fracture site during movement. |
| **Cerclage Wiring** | Comminuted fractures. | A circumferential wire is placed around the fragments to hold them together. Often used with TBW. |
| **[[Partial Patellectomy]]** | Comminuted fracture of one pole (superior or inferior). | The comminuted pole is excised. The patellar or quadriceps tendon is reattached to the remaining major fragment using non-absorbable sutures. |
| **[[Total Patellectomy]]** | Severely comminuted fractures where reconstruction is impossible. | Removal of the entire patella. The quadriceps tendon is sutured directly to the patellar tendon. *Disadvantage:* Loss of mechanical advantage leads to extensor weakness (lag) and loss of knee protection. |

**Important Surgical Step:** Repair of the **medial and lateral retinacula** is mandatory during surgery to restore extensor power.

### Complications
1.  **[[Patellofemoral Osteoarthritis]]:** Common after comminuted fractures or malreduction causing articular irregularity.
2.  **Knee Stiffness:** Loss of flexion due to adhesions or prolonged immobilization.
3.  **Extensor Weakness/Lag:** Especially after total patellectomy due to the loss of the fulcrum effect.
4.  **Non-union:** Rare, but can occur.
5.  **Implant prominence/pain:** Hardware (wires) often becomes symptomatic and may need removal after union.
