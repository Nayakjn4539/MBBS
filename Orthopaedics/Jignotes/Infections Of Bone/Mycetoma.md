# Mycetoma (Madura Foot)

### Introduction and Epidemiology
[[Mycetoma]], commonly known as **Madura Foot**, is a chronic granulomatous infection involving the subcutaneous tissues and bone.
*   **Origin:** First identified in **Madurai, India** in 1842, hence the name "Madura foot".
*   **Causative Agents:** It is a [[Fungal Infection]] often caused by:
    *   *[[Madurella mycetomi]]*
    *   *[[Madurella grisea]]*
    *   *Note:* Similar clinical presentations can be caused by bacteria (Actinomycosis), but the term "Madura foot" in these texts is discussed primarily under mycotic infections,.
*   **Risk Factors:**
    *   Most common in **agricultural workers**.
    *   People who walk **barefoot** in endemic areas.

### Pathogenesis
The infection typically follows a traumatic inoculation of the organism into the skin.
1.  **Route of Entry:** Direct invasion through a skin puncture, cut wound, or thorn prick,.
2.  **Spread:** The infection spreads from the subcutaneous tissue $\rightarrow$ fascia $\rightarrow$ tendon sheaths $\rightarrow$ eventually establishing in the [[Bone]] and [[Joint]].
3.  **Reaction:** It evokes a chronic **granulomatous reaction** in the tissues, which break down to form multiple ulcerations and sinuses.

### Clinical Features
The clinical presentation is distinct and progressive.
*   **Onset:** Starts as a nodular swelling over the dorsum or sole of the foot.
*   **Progression:** The nodules burst and discharge thin pus. Gradually, more nodules form, resulting in a massively swollen foot.
*   **Classic Triad:**
    1.  **Tumefaction:** Swollen foot with a nodular surface.
    2.  **Draining Sinuses:** Multiple discharging sinuses.
    3.  **Grains:** The pus characteristically contains small **black granules**.
*   **Palpation:** The surrounding area is **indurated** and gives a characteristic **"Woody feel"**.
*   **Pain:** Unlike pyogenic osteomyelitis, pain is **not** a prominent feature unless there is a secondary bacterial infection.

### Diagnosis
*   **Clinical:** Presence of the classic triad (Swelling, Sinuses, Granules) in a patient from an endemic area.
*   **Microscopy:** Examination of the discharge (pus) reveals the characteristic **fungal granules**,.
*   **Biopsy:** Identification of the organism in the biopsy specimen confirms the diagnosis.
*   **Radiography (X-ray):**
    *   Shows soft tissue swelling.
    *   Bone destruction may be visible in late stages.
    *   [[Sequestrum]]: May show a **Black Sequestrum**, which is specific to fungal osteomyelitis.

### Differential Diagnosis: Sequestrum Types
The type of [[Sequestrum]] found can help differentiate Mycetoma from other bone infections.

| Type of Sequestrum | Associated Condition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Black** | **Fungal Osteomyelitis / [[Mycetoma]]**, |
| **Ivory** | [[Syphilitic Osteomyelitis]] |
| **Sandy / Rice grain / Feathery** | [[Tuberculosis]], |
| **Diaphyseal / Tubular** | Acute Pyogenic [[Osteomyelitis]] (in children), |
| **Ring** | Infected [[Pin Tract]], |
| **Coke** | [[Tuberculosis]] |

### Treatment
The management depends on the stage of the disease.
*   **Medical Management:**
    *   Effective **only in early cases**.
    *   **Drugs:** Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, [[Ketoconazole]], [[Dapsone]].
*   **Surgical Management:**
    *   Indicated for severe forms of involvement where bone destruction is extensive.
    *   **[[Amputation]]** is often necessary in advanced cases to remove the burden of infection.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Prevention:** Wearing shoes is the most effective preventative measure for agricultural workers to avoid thorn pricks.
*   **Early Detection:** Since medical therapy fails in late stages, early identification of the nodule and granules is crucial to save the limb from amputation.
