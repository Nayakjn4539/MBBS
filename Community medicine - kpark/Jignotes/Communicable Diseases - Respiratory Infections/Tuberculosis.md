# [[Communicable Diseases - Respiratory Infections]] > Tuberculosis

### **Tuberculosis: Epidemiology & Management**

**Tuberculosis (TB)** is a specific infectious disease caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. It is a major public health problem in India and is often described as the **"Barometer of Social Welfare"** because its prevalence is closely linked to poverty, overcrowding, and poor quality of life.

---

### **1. Epidemiological Determinants**

#### **A. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** [[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]. It is a facultative intracellular parasite, aerobic, and acid-fast (due to mycolic acid in the cell wall).
*   **Source of Infection:** 
    *   **Human source:** A human case with sputum positive for tubercle bacilli is the most common source. One infectious pulmonary TB case can infect **10–15 persons in a year**.
    *   **Bovine source:** Infected milk (rare in India due to the habit of boiling milk).
*   **Communicability:** Patients are infective as long as they remain untreated. Effective treatment reduces infectivity by **90% within 48 hours**.
*   **Survivability:** The bacilli can remain alive in dried sputum for long periods but are killed by direct sunlight, heat, and phenols.

#### **B. Host Factors**
*   **Age:** Affects all ages. In developing countries, there is a sharp rise in infection rates from childhood to adolescence (15–24 years).
*   **Sex:** More prevalent in **males** than females.
*   **Immunity:** Man has no inherited immunity. Immunity is cell-mediated (T-cells) acquired via natural infection or [[BCG vaccination]].
*   **Risk Factors:** 
    *   **Malnutrition:** Increases susceptibility and severity.
    *   **HIV:** Most potent risk factor for progression from latent infection to active disease.
    *   **Diabetes:** Accounts for ~20% of all TB cases.
    *   **Tobacco:** Smoking increases the risk of TB disease and mortality.

#### **C. Environmental Factors**
*   **Social Factors:** Poverty, poor housing, overcrowding, and lack of ventilation facilitate transmission.
*   **Urbanization:** Unplanned urbanization and growth of slums create favorable conditions for spread.

---

### **2. Mode of Transmission**
*   **Droplet Infection:** Direct inhalation of aerosolized droplets generated by coughing, sneezing, or talking by an infectious patient.
*   **Droplet Nuclei:** Tiny particles (1–5 microns) that remain suspended in the air for long periods. This is the **main mode** of transmission.
*   **Note:** TB is **not** transmitted by fomites (dishes, clothes) or surface contact.

---

### **3. Natural History of Disease**

*   **Incubation Period:** Time from infection to demonstrable primary lesion or tuberculin sensitivity is **3 to 6 weeks**. The progression to active disease can take years or decades (Latent TB).
*   **Iceberg Phenomenon:**
    *   **Floating Tip:** Clinical cases (Sputum positive + Sputum negative).
    *   **Submerged Portion:** Undiagnosed cases and Latent TB infection (approx. 40% of the Indian population is infected).

**Clinical Picture:**
*   Persistent cough (>2 weeks), fever (evening rise), weight loss, night sweats, hemoptysis, and chest pain.

### **4. Diagnosis (NTEP Guidelines)**

Under the **National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme ([[NTEP]])**, diagnosis has shifted from microscopy-centric to molecular-centric methods.

#### **Diagnostic Algorithm**
1.  **Presumptive TB Case:** Anyone with cough >2 weeks, fever >2 weeks, weight loss, or hemoptysis.
2.  **First Line Investigation:** **Sputum Examination**.
    *   **Smear Microscopy:** **ZN Staining** (Acid Fast Bacilli appear as pink rods on blue background) or **Fluorescent Microscopy** (more sensitive).
    *   **Molecular Tests (NAAT):** **CBNAAT (GeneXpert)** or **TrueNat**.
        *   **High Sensitivity:** Detects even low bacillary load.
        *   **Drug Resistance:** Detects Rifampicin resistance immediately.
        *   *NTEP Mandate:* Universal DST (Drug Susceptibility Testing) for all diagnosed cases to rule out drug resistance.
3.  **Chest X-Ray:** Used as a screening tool or supportive diagnosis for smear-negative cases.
4.  **Tuberculin Skin Test ([[Mantoux Test]]):**
    *   Used for diagnosis in children and to detect latent infection.
    *   Dose: 1 TU of **PPD RT-23** with Tween-80.
    *   Reading: Induration measured after 72 hours.
    *   **Positive:** >10 mm induration (>5 mm in HIV).

### **5. Treatment Regimens**

NTEP now uses **Daily Regimens** with Fixed Dose Combinations (FDCs) based on weight bands.

#### **A. Drug Sensitive TB (DSTB)**
For all new and previously treated cases sensitive to Isoniazid and Rifampicin.

| Phase | Duration | Drugs (Daily FDC) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Intensive Phase (IP)** | 2 Months | **HRZE** (Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol) |
| **Continuation Phase (CP)**| 4 Months | **HRE** (Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Ethambutol) |

*   **Clinical Relevance:** Pyrazinamide is stopped in the continuation phase. If the patient is sputum positive at end of IP, continue CP and send sample for culture/DST.

#### **B. Drug Resistant TB (DR-TB)**
Recent updates in classification and treatment:

*   **MDR-TB:** Resistant to Isoniazid (H) + Rifampicin (R).
*   **XDR-TB:** MDR + Resistance to any Fluoroquinolone (Group A drug).
*   **Regimens:**
    *   **Shorter Oral Bedquiline Regimen:** For MDR/RR-TB without fluoroquinolone resistance. Duration ~9-11 months.
    *   **Longer Oral M/XDR Regimen:** 18-20 months for complex resistance. Uses drugs like **Bedaquiline**, Linezolid, Clofazimine.

**Mnemonic for First Line Drugs (RIPE):**
*   **R**ifampicin (Causes Red urine)
*   **I**soniazid (Causes Peripheral neuritis - give Vit B6)
*   **P**yrazinamide (Causes Hyperuricemia/Gout)
*   **E**thambutol (Causes Eye problems/Optic neuritis - **E** for **E**ye)

### **6. Prevention and Control**

1.  **BCG Vaccination:**
    *   **Type:** Live Attenuated (Danish 1331 strain).
    *   **Dose:** 0.1 ml (0.05 ml for neonates < 1 month). Intradermal at Left Upper Arm.
    *   **Efficacy:** 0-80%. Protects mainly against severe forms (Meningitis, Miliary TB) in children. Does not prevent transmission.

2.  **TB Preventive Therapy (TPT):**
    *   Given to **Latent TB** cases to prevent progression to active disease.
    *   **Target Groups:**
        *   All PLHIV (People Living with HIV).
        *   Household contacts < 5 years of active TB cases (after ruling out active TB).
        *   Household contacts > 5 years (Expanded group).
    *   **Regimen:**
        *   6 months daily Isoniazid (**6H**).
        *   3 months weekly Isoniazid + Rifapentine (**3HP**).

3.  **Infection Control:** Cough etiquette, ventilation, N95 masks for healthcare workers.

### **7. National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme ([[NTEP]])**

*   **Vision:** TB-Free India.
*   **Goal:** End TB by **2025** (5 years ahead of global SDG targets).
*   **Strategy Pillars (DTPB):**
    *   **D**etect: Early diagnosis via U-DST (Universal Drug Susceptibility Testing).
    *   **T**reat: Daily regimen, 99-DOTS technology for adherence.
    *   **P**revent: TPT, airborne infection control.
    *   **B**uild: Health system strengthening.
*   **[[Nikshay]]:** Web-based portal for case notification and patient management.
*   **Nikshay Poshan Yojana:** Financial incentive of **₹500/month** to all TB patients for nutrition support.

### **Important Indices for Epidemiology**
1.  **Annual Risk of Infection (ARI):** Best indicator of the trend of TB transmission in the community. In India, ARI is ~1.5%. **1% ARI = 50 new smear-positive cases per 1,00,000 population**.
2.  **Prevalence of Infection:** Measured by Tuberculin survey (Mantoux).
3.  **Incidence of Disease:** Number of new cases (NOT infection) occurring in a year.
