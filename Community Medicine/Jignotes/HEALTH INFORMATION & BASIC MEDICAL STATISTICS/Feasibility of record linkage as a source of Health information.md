# [[HEALTH INFORMATION & BASIC MEDICAL STATISTICS]] > Feasibility of record linkage as a source of Health information

### Feasibility of Record Linkage as a Source of Health Information

**[[Record Linkage]]** is the process of bringing together records relating to one individual (or one family) that originate in different times or places. The term **"Medical Record Linkage"** implies the assembly and maintenance of a file for each individual in a population, containing the most important records relating to their health.

The events commonly linked include birth, marriage, death, hospital admission and discharge, sickness absence, and prophylactic procedures.

#### 1. Current Status of Feasibility
While record linkage is a powerful tool for longitudinal analysis, its **feasibility** faces significant challenges, particularly in developing nations.

*   **Volume of Data:** The main problem with record linkage is the massive volume of data that can accumulate. Handling this requires sophisticated data management systems.
*   **Limited Scale Application:** In practice, record linkage has been applied only on a limited scale. It is primarily feasible for specific research areas such as:
    *   [[Twin Studies]]
    *   Measurement of [[Morbidity]]
    *   [[Chronic Disease Epidemiology]]
    *   Family and [[Genetic Studies]]
*   **Developing Countries:** At the moment, comprehensive record linkage is considered **beyond the reach** of many developing countries. This is due to the lack of centralized digital infrastructure, unique patient identifiers (though improving with systems like ABHA in India), and resource constraints.

#### 2. Uses and Importance
Despite feasibility issues, when successfully implemented, record linkage allows for:
*   **Aetiological Studies:** It is particularly suitable for studying associations between diseases, which may have **aetiological significance** (e.g., linking birth weight records to adult cardiovascular disease records).
*   **Life-course Epidemiology:** Tracking health from birth to death.

#### 3. Comparison: Potential vs. Feasibility

| Aspect | Description | Feasibility Constraint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Continuity** | Provides a complete health history of an individual. | Requires creating a permanent record that follows the patient, which is logistically difficult. |
| **Disease Association** | Excellent for finding links between past exposure and current disease. | Requires **[[Record Linkage]]** over long periods (years/decades), increasing the risk of lost data. |
| **Implementation** | Theoretically sound for comprehensive care. | Practical accumulation of data is overwhelming without advanced IT support. |

#### Clinical Relevance
In clinical practice, record linkage is the "Holy Grail" of patient history taking. If a physician can access a linked record, they can see that a patient presenting with heart disease today had a low birth weight 40 years ago, or had a specific drug reaction in a different city. This aids in accurate **diagnosis** and **management**.

#### Mnemonic
**Challenges to Feasibility: "VOLT"**
*   **V** - **V**olume of data is massive.
*   **O** - **O**nly applied on a limited scale.
*   **L** - **L**imited reach in developing countries.
*   **T** - **T**win and genetic studies are the current primary use.
