# [[Strabismus (Squint)]] > A and V Patterns

# A and V Patterns of Strabismus

[[A and V patterns]] are types of **vertically incomitant horizontal strabismus** where the amount of horizontal deviation varies significantly between upward and downward gaze,.

### Definition and Criteria
These patterns are labeled based on the shape the visual axes form (or the change in deviation) when moving from upgaze to downgaze.

*   **A Pattern:** The amount of deviation changes by more than **10 Prism Diopters (PD)** between upward and downward gaze.
*   **V Pattern:** The amount of deviation changes by more than **15 Prism Diopters (PD)** between upward and downward gaze.

> **Note:** A physiological tendency exists for eyes to diverge slightly on elevation.

### Classification

The patterns are applied to both [[esotropia]] (convergent squint) and [[exotropia]] (divergent squint).

#### 1. 'A' Pattern
The eyes are closer together in upward gaze and further apart in downward gaze (resembling the letter A).
*   **'A' Esotropia:** The amount of esotropia (inward deviation) **increases** in upward gaze and **decreases** in downward gaze.
*   **'A' Exotropia:** The amount of exotropia (outward deviation) **decreases** in upward gaze and **increases** in downward gaze.

#### 2. 'V' Pattern
The eyes are further apart in upward gaze and closer together in downward gaze (resembling the letter V).
*   **'V' Esotropia:** The amount of esotropia **decreases** in upward gaze and **increases** in downward gaze.
*   **'V' Exotropia:** The amount of exotropia **increases** in upward gaze and **decreases** in downward gaze.

### Etiology
The exact cause can vary, but dysfunction of the **oblique muscles** is the most common cause of A and V patterns.

*   **V Pattern:** Usually caused by **overaction** of the [[inferior oblique]] or **weakness** of the [[superior oblique]].
*   **A Pattern:** Usually caused by **overaction** of the [[superior oblique]] or **weakness** of the [[inferior oblique]].
*   **Other Factors:** Dysfunction of horizontal rectus muscles, vertical muscle dysfunction, and orbital factors (e.g., craniofacial anomalies).

### Diagnosis and Assessment
*   **Cover Test:** The 'A' and 'V' phenomena should be assessed by the [[cover test]] in **25° upward** and **25° downward** gaze.
*   **Fixation:** The test should be performed for both near and distance fixation.
*   **Refraction:** Appropriate glasses should be worn during testing.
*   **Compensatory Head Posture:**
    *   **Chin Elevation:** Seen in 'A' Esotropia or 'V' Exotropia (to fuse in downward gaze).
    *   **Chin Depression:** Seen in 'V' Esotropia or 'A' Exotropia (to fuse in upward gaze).

### Management

#### Indications for Surgery
*   **Cosmetic:** Gross amounts of A and V patterns may require adjustment even if [[binocular single vision]] (BSV) is not achievable.
*   **Functional:** If useful BSV is present but maintained only by a compensatory head posture (chin elevation or depression), surgery is indicated.
    *   **Goal:** Binocular vision in the primary position and downward gaze is prioritized over upward gaze.

#### Surgical Principles
The surgical approach depends on whether oblique muscle dysfunction is present.

**1. Presence of Oblique Overaction**
If oblique muscle overaction is identified, the primary surgical step involves weakening the overacting obliques.
*   **V Pattern:** Weakening of the **Inferior Oblique** (e.g., anteropositioning or recession),.
*   **A Pattern:** Weakening of the **Superior Oblique** (e.g., bilateral tenectomy),,.

**2. Absence of Oblique Overaction (Horizontal Rectus Transposition)**
If there is no definite overaction of the obliques, the insertions of the horizontal rectus muscles are vertically transposed (shifted up or down).

**Mnemonic for Transposition: MALE**
*   **M**edial recti are moved toward the **A**pex of the pattern (A or V).
*   **L**ateral recti are moved toward the **E**mpty space (open end) of the pattern.

| Pattern | Medial Rectus Shift | Lateral Rectus Shift |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A-Pattern** (Apex Up) | Up | Down |
| **V-Pattern** (Apex Down) | Down | Up |

### Specific Surgical Procedures

#### For 'A' Esotropia
*   **With Superior Oblique Overaction:** Bilateral weakening of the [[superior oblique]] muscle.
    *   *Technique:* 6-mm tenectomy at the nasal border of the superior rectus muscle.
*   **Without Vertical Muscle Anomaly:**
    *   Resection of [[lateral rectus]] with **downward** displacement.
    *   Recession of [[medial rectus]] with **upward** displacement.

#### For 'A' Exotropia
*   **With Superior Oblique Overaction:** Bilateral weakening of the superior oblique.
*   **Without Vertical Muscle Anomaly:** Resection of medial recti with **elevation** of insertions (results often disappointing).

#### For 'V' Esotropia
*   **With Inferior Oblique Overaction:** Bilateral **anteropositioning** of the [[inferior oblique]] muscle with recession of the medial rectus muscles.
*   **Without Vertical Muscle Anomaly:** Recession of [[medial rectus]] with **downward** displacement.

#### For 'V' Exotropia
*   **With Inferior Oblique Overaction:** Bilateral **anteropositioning** of the inferior oblique (with or without recession).
*   **Without Vertical Muscle Anomaly:** Recession of [[lateral rectus]] with **upward** displacement.
