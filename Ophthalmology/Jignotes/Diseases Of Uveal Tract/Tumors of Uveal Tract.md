# Tumors of the Uveal Tract

## Classification

The tumors of the uveal tract are classified based on their anatomical location (Iris, Ciliary body, Choroid) and their nature (Benign or Malignant).

| Site | Benign Tumors | Malignant Tumors |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Choroid** | • [[Choroidal Naevus]]<br>• [[Choroidal Haemangioma]]<br>• [[Melanocytoma]]<br>• [[Choroidal Osteoma]] | • [[Malignant Melanoma of Choroid]] (Primary)<br>• Metastatic Carcinoma (Secondary) |
| **Ciliary Body** | • Benign Cyst<br>• Hyperplasia<br>• [[Medulloepithelioma]] (Diktyoma) | • [[Malignant Melanoma of Ciliary Body]] |
| **Iris** | • [[Iris Naevus]]<br>• Benign Cyst<br>• [[Naevoxanthoendothelioma]] (Juvenile Xanthogranuloma)<br>• [[Lisch Nodules]] | • [[Malignant Melanoma of Iris]] |

## Malignant Melanoma of the Choroid

It is the **most common primary intraocular malignant tumor in adults**.,,

### Epidemiology
*   **Age:** Typically occurs between 40–70 years.
*   **Race:** Rare in Blacks and Asians; more common in Whites.
*   **Laterality:** Almost always unilateral and single.
*   **Origin:** Arises from neural crest-derived pigment cells (dendritic melanocytes) of the uvea.

### Pathology
The tumor may arise *de novo* or from a pre-existing [[Naevus]].
**Gross Morphology:**
1.  **Circumscribed (Pedunculated):** Initially flat slate-grey area $\rightarrow$ becomes raised $\rightarrow$ ruptures through [[Bruch's Membrane]]. This gives the characteristic **Mushroom** or **Collar-Stud appearance**.,
2.  **Diffuse (Flat):** Spreads laterally throughout the uvea without forming a distinct mass (rare, 5%).,

**Histopathology (Modified Callender’s Classification):**
This classification has prognostic significance (from best to worst prognosis):
1.  **Spindle A:** Slender cells, flattened nucleus, no nucleolus (Best prognosis).
2.  **Spindle B:** Larger cells, oval nucleus, prominent nucleolus.
3.  **Mixed:** Contains both spindle and epithelioid cells.
4.  **Epithelioid:** Large, pleomorphic cells, high mitotic activity (Worst prognosis).,,
*   **Necrotic Melanoma:** Predominant cell type unrecognizable.
*   **Reticulin Content:** Higher reticulin content is associated with lower malignancy.

### Clinical Stages
The natural history is classically divided into four stages:,

#### 1. Quiescent Stage
*   **Symptoms:** Depends on location. Peripheral tumors may be asymptomatic. Posterior tumors cause early visual loss, photopsia, or scotoma.
*   **Signs:**
    *   Elevated pigmented oval mass.
    *   **Orange patches** (lipofuscin accumulation) over the surface.,
    *   [[Exudative Retinal Detachment]]: Smooth, convex, shifting fluid (hallmark), absence of retinal holes.,
    *   **Sentinel Vessels:** Dilated episcleral vessels in the quadrant of the tumor.

#### 2. Glaucomatous Stage
Painful red eye due to raised Intraocular Pressure (IOP). Mechanisms include:
*   Direct pressure on lens-iris diaphragm causing angle closure.
*   Blockage of venous outflow (pressure on [[Vortex Veins]]).
*   Infiltration of trabecular meshwork.
*   Neovascularization of the angle (NVA).

#### 3. Stage of Extraocular Extension
*   Tumor bursts through the sclera, usually along emissaria (ciliary vessels/nerves).
*   Leads to rapid fungation and [[Proptosis]].,

#### 4. Stage of Distant Metastasis
*   **Route:** Blood-borne (Haematogenous). Lymphatic spread is rare/unknown.
*   **Site:** **Liver** is the most common site (commonest cause of death).

### Diagnosis
**Clinical Tests:**
*   **Indirect Ophthalmoscopy:** Stereoscopic view of the mass and shifting fluid.
*   **Transillumination:** The tumor is opaque to light (blocks light), unlike simple serous fluid which is transparent.

**Investigations:**
1.  **Ultrasonography (USG):**
    *   **A-Scan:** Low to medium internal reflectivity (due to homogeneous cellular structure). Large angle kappa.
    *   **B-Scan (IOC):** **Choroidal Excavation**, **Acoustic Hollowing**, and **Mushroom/Collar-stud configuration**.,
    *   > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> B-scan showing a mushroom-shaped mass breaking through Bruch's membrane with acoustic hollowing
2.  **Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA):**
    *   **Double Circulation:** Simultaneous visualization of retinal and choroidal (tumor) circulation.
    *   Progressive leakage (Hot spots) and late staining.
3.  **Indocyanine Green Angiography (ICGA):** Better delineation of tumor vasculature.
4.  **MRI:** Hyperintense on T1, Hypointense on T2 (Melanotic).
5.  **Systemic Workup:** Liver function tests (LDH, GGT) and USG Abdomen/PET scan to rule out metastasis.

### Treatment
Treatment depends on tumor size, location, and the status of the other eye.

**1. Observation**
*   For small, asymptomatic lesions (< 2mm height), dormant tumors, or in very old/sick patients.

**2. Conservative (Globe-Salvaging) Therapy**
*   **Brachytherapy (Plaque Radiotherapy):**
    *   *Indication:* Tumors < 10 mm height and < 16 mm base.
    *   *Isotopes:* **Iodine-125** (most common), Cobalt-60, Palladium-103, Ruthenium-106.
    *   Plaque is sutured to the sclera for 3-7 days.
*   **Transpupillary Thermotherapy (TTT):** Uses Diode laser (810 nm). Useful for small tumors near the optic disc/fovea.
*   **External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT):** Using charged particles (Protons/Helium ions).
*   **Stereotactic Radiosurgery:** Gamma Knife or CyberKnife.
*   **Trans-scleral Local Resection:** For anterior tumors < 16mm diameter (difficult procedure).

**3. Surgical Removal**
*   **Enucleation:**
    *   *Indications:* Large tumors (>16mm base, >10mm height), painful blind eye, diffuse melanoma, or when conservative therapy fails.
    *   **Note:** Minimize manipulation to prevent metastatic embolization.
*   **Exenteration:** Indicated for extraocular extension into the orbit.

**4. Palliative Therapy**
*   Chemotherapy/Immunotherapy for distant metastasis.

## Differential Diagnosis: Choroidal Naevus
*   Benign, congenital, flat, slate-grey lesion.
*   Usually < 2 Disc Diameters (DD).
*   **Risk factors for malignancy (Mnemonic: TFSOM):**
    *   **T**hickness > 2mm.
    *   **F**luid (Subretinal).
    *   **S**ymptoms (Flashes/Floaters).
    *   **O**range Pigment (Lipofuscin).
    *   **M**argin touching optic disc.,

## Other Choroidal Tumors

| Tumor | Features | Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Choroidal Haemangioma** | **Localized:** Salmon-pink, dome-shaped mass at posterior pole.<br>**Diffuse:** Diffuse red "Tomato Ketchup" fundus. | Localized causes exudative RD.<br>Diffuse type is associated with **[[Sturge-Weber Syndrome]]**. |
| **Melanocytoma** | Jet black lesion, usually on/adjacent to Optic Disc. | Benign, usually stationary. |
| **Choroidal Osteoma** | Yellow-orange, bony tumor. Usually young females. | Calcified (Bone within eye). |
| **Metastatic Carcinoma** | **Most common intraocular tumor overall**. Creamy yellow, flat, multiple, bilateral. | **Primary Sites:**<br>• Females: **Breast** (most common).<br>• Males: **Lung** (most common).<br>• Others: GIT, Kidney, Prostate. |
