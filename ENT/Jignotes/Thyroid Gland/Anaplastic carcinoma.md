# [[Anaplastic Carcinoma]] of the [[Thyroid Gland]]

**Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma (ATC)**, also known as undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma, is one of the most aggressive and lethal malignancies in humans. It arises from the follicular cells of the [[thyroid gland]] but lacks the differentiation features of papillary or follicular cancers.

### Epidemiology and Etiology
*   **Incidence:** Rare; accounts for <5% of all thyroid malignancies.
*   **Age:** Disease of the elderly; peak incidence in the **6th and 7th decades** (60–80 years). Rare before age 50.
*   **Gender:** Females are affected more than males (Ratio ~ 3:2).
*   **Risk Factors:**
    *   History of long-standing [[multinodular goiter]] (dedifferentiation of pre-existing disease).
    *   History of previous differentiated thyroid cancer ([[Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma]] or [[Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma]]).
    *   History of radiation exposure.

### Pathophysiology
*   **Defect:** Loss of differentiation markers (does not produce thyroglobulin, does not take up radioiodine).
*   **Origin:** It is believed to arise from the **dedifferentiation** of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma (papillary or follicular) or directly from follicular cells due to accumulation of genetic mutations (e.g., p53 mutations).
*   **Microscopy:** 
    *   Markedly **pleomorphic cells** (spindle, giant, or squamoid cells).
    *   High mitotic activity (numerous mitotic figures).
    *   Extensive **necrosis** and hemorrhage.
    *   Vascular invasion is readily seen.

### Clinical Features
The presentation is typically fulminant and dramatic.

**Symptoms:**
*   **Rapidly enlarging neck mass:** History of a long-standing goiter that suddenly increases in size.
*   **Pain:** A distinctive feature (differentiates it from [[Thyroid Lymphoma]] which is usually painless).
*   **Compressive Symptoms (Early and Severe):**
    *   **Hoarseness:** Due to [[Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve]] involvement.
    *   **Dysphagia:** Due to esophageal compression/invasion.
    *   **Stridor/Dyspnea:** Due to tracheal compression/invasion.
    *   **Thoracic Inlet Obstruction:** Respiratory distress.

**Signs:**
*   **Consistency:** Hard, **stony**, fixed, and "craggy" mass.
*   **Fixity:** Fixed to underlying structures and overlying skin.
*   **Lymphadenopathy:** Cervical lymph node involvement is seen in **80%** of patients at presentation. The nodal mass may fuse with the thyroid mass.
*   **Distant Metastasis:** Present in **50%** at diagnosis. Common sites: **Lungs**, Bones, Brain.

### Staging (TNM)
Due to its aggressive nature, **all** anaplastic carcinomas are classified as **Stage IV** regardless of size.

| Stage | TNM Criteria | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stage IVA** | **T4a** | Intrathyroidal anaplastic carcinoma. Tumor invading cricoid/thyroid cartilage, strap muscles, or soft tissues. |
| **Stage IVB** | **T4b** | Extrathyroidal anaplastic carcinoma. Tumor invades prevertebral fascia, encases carotid artery, or mediastinal vessels. |
| **Stage IVC** | **M1** | Distant Metastasis present. |

### Diagnostic Workup
*   **[[Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology]] (FNAC):**
    *   Usually reveals malignant cells (pleomorphic, giant cells).
    *   Often categorized as **Bethesda Category VI** (Malignant).
    *   *Limitation:* May be difficult to differentiate from metastatic carcinoma or high-grade lymphoma.
*   **Biopsy (Core or Incisional):**
    *   Often required for definitive diagnosis and **Immunohistochemistry (IHC)**.
    *   Essential to rule out [[Thyroid Lymphoma]] (which is treatable) and [[Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma]].
*   **Imaging:**
    *   **CT Scan (Neck/Chest):** To assess the extent of local invasion (trachea, esophagus, vessels) and pulmonary metastasis.
    *   **MRI:** Better for soft tissue delineation.
    *   **Thyroid Scan:** Shows a **"Cold Nodule"** (does not take up iodine).

### Differential Diagnosis: Anaplastic Carcinoma vs. Thyroid Lymphoma
It is critical to distinguish these two as management differs drastically.

| Feature | Anaplastic Carcinoma | Thyroid Lymphoma |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **History** | Long-standing Goiter | [[Hashimoto's Thyroiditis]] |
| **Pain** | **Painful** | Usually Painless |
| **Consistency** | Stony Hard, Craggy | Firm, Rubbery (Diffuse) |
| **Duration** | Weeks to Months | Rapid but sometimes slower than ATC |
| **Treatment** | Palliation / Surgery (limited) | [[Chemotherapy]] + [[Radiotherapy]] |
| **Prognosis** | Dismal | Better (Responsive to Chemo/RT) |

### Management
Treatment is generally unsatisfactory and primarily **palliative**. Multidisciplinary approach is required.

**1. Airway Management**
*   **[[Tracheostomy]]:** Often required for stridor/airway obstruction.
*   Ideally, an **isthmus split tracheostomy** is performed to secure the airway if compression is severe.

**2. Surgery**
*   **Role:** Limited. Complete resection is rarely possible due to extensive local invasion.
*   **Indication:** Attempted only if the disease is localized (rare) or for **debulking** to reduce airway compression.
*   **Radical Neck Dissection:** Offers **no survival advantage** over less aggressive surgery.

**3. Radiotherapy (RT)**
*   **External Beam Radiotherapy:** Although the tumor is considered radioresistant, hyperfractionated RT may achieve partial regression and local control.
*   Used in combined modality protocols.

**4. Chemotherapy**
*   Adjuvant chemotherapy (e.g., **Doxorubicin**, Cisplatin, Paclitaxel) is used but has limited efficacy.
*   Combined modality (Surgery + RT + Chemo) offers the longest survival rates, though still poor.

**5. Radioactive Iodine (RAI)**
*   **Not effective** as anaplastic cells do not concentrate iodine.

### Prognosis
*   **Outcome:** Uniformly fatal.
*   **Median Survival:** 4–6 months from diagnosis.
*   **5-Year Survival:** Less than **5-10%**.
*   **Cause of Death:** Usually due to local extension causing uncontrolled airway obstruction or hemorrhage, or distant metastasis.

*   **A**ggressive behavior (Rapid growth)
