# [[HOSPITAL WASTE MANAGEMENT]] > Name the different types of biomedical wastes generated in your hospital. Write the measures for their disposal as per national guidelines.

### **Biomedical Waste Management**

[[Biomedical waste]] is defined as any waste generated during the diagnosis, treatment, or immunization of human beings or animals, or in research activities pertaining thereto, or in the production or testing of biologicals.

In India, the management of this waste is governed by the **Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016** (superseding the 1998 rules).

### **Classification and Disposal Measures (Color Coding)**

Effective management requires segregation at the point of generation into color-coded containers/bags.

| **Color Code** | **Type of Waste (Content)** | **Treatment and Disposal Options** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Yellow Category]]** | **1. Human Anatomical Waste:** Tissues, organs, body parts, fetus.<br>**2. Animal Anatomical Waste.**<br>**3. Soiled Waste:** Items contaminated with blood/body fluids (cotton, dressings, plaster casts).<br>**4. Expired/Discarded Medicines:** Cytotoxic drugs.<br>**5. Chemical Waste.**<br>**6. Chemical Liquid Waste:** X-ray fluid, discarded formalin.<br>**7. Microbiology/Biotechnology Waste:** Cultures, vaccines. | **1. [[Incineration]]:** High-temperature dry oxidation to reduce organic waste to inorganic ash.<br>**2. Plasma Pyrolysis.**<br>**3. Deep Burial:** Only permitted in rural/remote areas without access to common treatment facilities. |
| **[[Red Category]]** | **Contaminated Waste (Recyclable):**<br>Wastes generated from disposable items such as:<br>- Tubing, bottles, intravenous tubes and sets.<br>- Catheters, urine bags.<br>- Syringes (without needles).<br>- Gloves. | **1. Autoclaving/Microwaving/Hydroclaving** (Sterilization).<br>**2. Shredding/Mutilation:** To prevent unauthorized reuse.<br>**3. Recycling:** Send to authorized recyclers for energy recovery or road making (plastics to diesel). |
| **[[White Category]]** (Translucent) | **Waste Sharps including Metals:**<br>- Needles.<br>- Syringes with fixed needles.<br>- Scalpels, blades.<br>- Any contaminated sharp object that may cause puncture/cuts. | **1. Autoclaving/Dry Heat Sterilization.**<br>**2. Shredding/Mutilation.**<br>**3. Encapsulation:** Filling containers with waste and immobilizing material (cement/plastic foam).<br>**4. Disposal:** Iron foundries or concrete waste sharp pits. |
| **[[Blue Category]]** | **1. Glassware:** Broken or discarded/contaminated glass (medicine vials, ampoules).<br>**2. Metallic Body Implants.** | **1. Disinfection:** Soaking in Sodium Hypochlorite.<br>**2. Autoclaving/Microwaving.**<br>**3. Recycling:** Sent for recycling. |

**Note regarding General Waste:**
*   **Black Bag:** Used for general waste like food waste, paper, and fruit peels. It is disposed of in municipal dumps.

### **Treatment Technologies**

1.  **[[Incineration]]:**
    *   A high-temperature dry oxidation process (>1200°C) that reduces organic and combustible waste to inorganic, incombustible matter.
    *   *Usage:* Human anatomical waste, animal waste, cytotoxic drugs.
    *   *Constraint:* PVC (chlorinated plastics) should **not** be incinerated as they release dioxins and furans.

2.  **[[Autoclaving]]:**
    *   Steam sterilization under pressure.
    *   *Standard:* 121°C for 45–60 minutes.
    *   *Usage:* Red and Blue category wastes (Plastic and Glass).

3.  **[[Inertization]]:**
    *   Mixing biomedical waste with cement and other substances (Lime) before disposal to minimize the risk of toxic substances migrating into ground/surface water.
    *   *Usage:* Pharmaceutical waste and incineration ash.
    *   *Formula:* 65% waste + 15% lime + 15% cement + 5% water.

4.  **[[Shredding]]:**
    *   Breaking material into smaller pieces to prevent reuse. Usually done after disinfection.

### **Mnemonics for Color Coding**

*   **Y**ellow = **Y**ucky (Flesh, tissues, blood-soiled items, pus).
*   **R**ed = **R**ecyclable (Rubber, Plastic tubes, catheters).
*   **W**hite = **W**eapon (Sharps like needles, blades that can hurt).
*   **B**lue = **B**roken (Broken glass, vials, implants).

### **Clinical Relevance**

*   **[[Segregation]] at Source:** The most critical step in BMW management. Mixing infectious waste (Yellow) with general waste makes the entire load infectious and increases the cost of disposal.
*   **Occupational Safety:** Improper disposal of **White** category waste (Sharps) is the leading cause of needle-stick injuries among healthcare workers, increasing the risk of Hepatitis B, C, and HIV.
*   **Mercury Disposal:** Broken thermometers (Mercury) should **never** be incinerated due to toxic emissions. They must be collected carefully and sent for recycling.
