# [[Nutrition And Health]] > Balanced Diet and RDA

### Balanced Diet

**Definition**
A [[Balanced Diet]] is defined as one which contains a variety of foods in such quantities and proportions that the need for **energy**, **amino acids**, **vitamins**, **minerals**, **fats**, **carbohydrates**, and other nutrients is adequately met for maintaining health, vitality, and general well-being.
*   *Crucial Point:* It also makes a small provision for extra nutrients to withstand short duration of leanness or fasting,.

**Composition of a Balanced Diet**
To achieve nutritional adequacy, the total daily energy intake should be distributed as follows,:

| Nutrient | Recommended % of Total Energy |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Carbohydrates** | 50 – 70% |
| **Fats** | 15 – 30% |
| **Proteins** | 10 – 15% |

**Dietary Goals (Prudent Diet)**
To prevent chronic degenerative diseases (like Coronary Heart Disease, Hypertension, Diabetes), the following goals are recommended,:
1.  **Fat Intake:** Limited to 15-30% of total daily intake.
2.  **Saturated Fats:** Should not exceed 10% of total energy.
3.  **Carbohydrates:** Avoid excessive refined carbs; increase consumption of complex carbohydrates rich in [[Dietary Fibre]].
4.  **Salt:** Intake should be reduced to an average of not more than 5g per day.
5.  **Junk Food:** Foods supplying "empty calories" (colas, ketchups) should be reduced.

### Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)

**Concept and Definition**
*   **RDA:** The average daily dietary nutrient intake level sufficient to meet the nutrient requirement of nearly all (**97–98%**) healthy individuals in a particular life stage and gender group.
*   It is considered a "Safe Level" of intake.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   For Nutrients (Protein, Vitamins, Minerals): **[[RDA = Mean + 2 SD]]** (Standard Deviation). This covers 97.5% of the population.
    *   **The Energy Exception:** For Energy (Calories), the **[[RDA = Mean]]** (Average Requirement).
    *   *Reason:* Excess energy intake is undesirable as it leads to obesity; therefore, no safety margin (+2SD) is added for energy,.

**Factors Affecting RDA**
1.  **Physical Activity:** Sedentary, Moderate, or Heavy work.
2.  **Physiological Status:** Pregnancy and Lactation increase requirements.
3.  **Age and Sex:** Growing children and adolescents have higher relative needs.
4.  **Body Weight:** Requirements often expressed per kg body weight.

**Reference Indian Adult (ICMR 2020)**
RDA is calculated based on a reference individual,:

| Feature | Reference Man | Reference Woman |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Age** | 18–29 years | 18–29 years |
| **Weight** | **60 kg** | **55 kg** |
| **Height** | 1.73 m | 1.61 m |
| **BMI** | 20.3 | 21.2 |
| **Health Status** | Free from disease | Free from disease |
| **Activity** | 8 hrs moderate activity | 8 hrs moderate activity |

**Summary of RDA for Indians (ICMR 2020)**
*(Selected values for quick revision)*,

| Category | Energy (Kcal/day) | Protein (g/day) | Calcium (mg/day) | Iron (mg/day) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Adult Man** | | | | |
| Sedentary | 2110 | 0.83 g/kg | 1000 | 19 |
| Moderate | 2710 | 0.83 g/kg | 1000 | 19 |
| Heavy | 3470 | 0.83 g/kg | 1000 | 19 |
| **Adult Woman** | | | | |
| Sedentary | 1660 | 0.83 g/kg | 1000 | 29 |
| Moderate | 2130 | 0.83 g/kg | 1000 | 29 |
| Heavy | 2720 | 0.83 g/kg | 1000 | 29 |
| **Pregnancy** | **+350** | **+9.5** (2nd Tri) | 1000 | 27 |
| **Lactation** | **+600** (0-6m) | **+16.9** (0-6m) | 1200 | 23 |

> **Note on Protein:** The safe level of protein intake for an Indian adult is **0.83 g/kg/day**,.

### Mnemonic Corner

**Essential Amino Acids**
(These must be supplied by the diet as the body cannot synthesize them)
**"PVT TIM HALL"**
*   **P**henylalanine
*   **V**aline
*   **T**hreonine
*   **T**ryptophan
*   **I**soleucine
*   **M**ethionine
*   **H**istidine (Semi-essential)
*   **A**rginine (Semi-essential)
*   **L**eucine
*   **L**ysine

**Limiting Amino Acids**
(The essential amino acid found in the smallest quantity in the food item)
*   **Cereals** lack **Lysine** (Think: Ce**real** Li**ar** = Lysine) or **Threonine**,.
*   **Pulses** lack **Methionine** (Think: **P**ulse **M** = Methionine).
*   **Maize** lacks **Tryptophan** & Lysine (leads to Pellagra).

### Clinical Relevance

1.  **Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM):** Occurs when the PE Ratio (Protein Energy Ratio) is **<4%**. Ideally, protein should provide 10-15% of energy.
2.  **Supplementary Action:** Since cereals lack lysine and pulses lack methionine, eating them together (e.g., Dal-Rice or Khichdi) improves the **[[Net Protein Utilization]] (NPU)**, making the protein quality comparable to animal protein.
3.  **Reference Protein:** **Egg** protein is considered the reference protein because its NPU is **96** (highest among foods).
4.  **Pellagra:** In populations where **Maize** or **Sorghum (Jowar)** is the staple diet, deficiency of **[[Niacin]]** (or its precursor Tryptophan) leads to Pellagra (characterized by Diarrhea, Dermatitis, Dementia),.
