# [[Diseases Of Lens]] > Acquired Cataract Classification

### Acquired Cataract Classification

[[Acquired Cataract]] refers to opacification of the [[Crystalline Lens]] or its capsule that develops after birth, usually in adults, resulting in visual impairment. It is distinct from congenital or developmental cataracts.

Classification is primarily done based on **Morphology**, **Etiology**, and **Stage of Maturity**.

### 1. Morphological Classification
This classification is based on the anatomical location of the opacity within the lens structure.

*   **[[Capsular Cataract]]**: Involves the anterior or posterior capsule.
*   **[[Subcapsular Cataract]]**: Involves the superficial part of the cortex just beneath the capsule.
    *   **Anterior Subcapsular Cataract (ASC)**: Lies under the anterior capsule.
    *   **Posterior Subcapsular Cataract (PSC)**: Lies under the posterior capsule (Cupuliform).
*   **[[Cortical Cataract]]**: Involves the major part of the lens cortex.
*   **[[Supranuclear Cataract]]**: Involves the deep cortex just outside the nucleus.
*   **[[Nuclear Cataract]]**: Involves the nucleus of the crystalline lens.
*   **[[Polar Cataract]]**: Involves the capsule and superficial cortex at the poles (Anterior or Posterior).

| Type | Key Feature | Common Associations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nuclear** | Sclerosis of central lens | Age-related, Smoking |
| **Cortical** | Wedge-shaped opacities (Cuneiform) | Hydration of lens, Diabetes |
| **Posterior Subcapsular** | Plaque-like opacity at posterior pole | Steroids, Radiation, Diabetes |

**Clinical Implication:**
> **[[Posterior Subcapsular Cataract]] (PSC)** is located near the nodal point of the eye. It causes profound vision loss (disproportionate to the opacity size), especially in bright light (due to miosis) and significantly affects near vision. Patients often complain of **glare** from oncoming headlights,.

### 2. Etiological Classification
Classifying cataract based on the underlying cause is crucial for management and systemic workup.

#### A. Senile Cataract (Age-Related)
The most common form of acquired cataract.
*   **Pathogenesis:** Oxidative damage, hydration, and protein denaturation due to aging.
*   **Subtypes:**
    *   **Cortical Senile Cataract:** Characterized by hydration and coagulation of proteins.
    *   **Nuclear Senile Cataract:** Characterized by sclerosis and pigment deposition (Urochrome).

#### B. Metabolic Cataract
Occurs due to endocrine disorders or biochemical abnormalities.
1.  **[[Diabetes Mellitus]]**:
    *   **True Diabetic Cataract:** "Snowflake" or "Snowstorm" opacities (fluid vacuoles) mostly in young type 1 diabetics,.
    *   **Senile Diabetic Cataract:** Occurs earlier and progresses rapidly in diabetics.
2.  **[[Galactosemia]]**:
    *   **Oil Droplet Cataract:** Central refraction opacity due to Galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GPUT) deficiency,.
3.  **[[Hypocalcemia]] (Parathyroid Tetany)**:
    *   Multicoloured crystals or small discrete white flecks; punctate subcapsular opacities,.
4.  **[[Wilson's Disease]]**:
    *   **Sunflower Cataract**: Copper deposition in the anterior lens capsule (stellate pattern),.

#### C. Traumatic Cataract
Caused by physical injury to the eye.
*   **Blunt Trauma (Contusion):** Causes **Rosette-shaped cataract** (flower-shaped opacity) or **Vossius Ring** (imprint of iris pigment on anterior capsule),.
*   **Penetrating Trauma:** Focal cortical opacities or rapid total opacification due to capsule rupture.
*   **Electric Cataract:** Punctate subcapsular opacities following electric shock/lightning.
*   **Radiational Cataract:**
    *   **Infrared (Heat):** **Glassblower’s cataract** (true exfoliation of anterior capsule),.
    *   **Ionizing Radiation (X-ray/Gamma):** Posterior subcapsular opacities,.

#### D. Toxic Cataract (Drug-Induced)
Caused by the systemic or topical use of certain medications.
*   **[[Corticosteroids]]**: Typically causes **Posterior Subcapsular Cataract (PSC)**,.
*   **Miotics (Anticholinesterases):** Anterior subcapsular granular changes.
*   **Other Drugs:** Chlorpromazine, Amiodarone (Anterior subcapsular deposits), Busulfan,.

#### E. Complicated Cataract (Secondary Cataract)
Opacification secondary to intraocular disease. The lens nutrition is disturbed due to inflammatory toxins.
*   **Causes:** Chronic **[[Anterior Uveitis]]** (Iridocyclitis), **[[Retinitis Pigmentosa]]**, High **[[Myopia]]**, **[[Retinal Detachment]]**, **[[Glaucoma]]** (Glaucomflecken),.
*   **Appearance:** Typically **Posterior Subcapsular**; shows **"Breadcrumb" appearance** and **Polychromatic Lustre** (Rainbow colors),.

#### F. Syndermatotic Cataract
Associated with skin diseases.
*   **[[Atopic Dermatitis]]**: Shield-like anterior subcapsular cataract,.
*   Other associations: Scleroderma, Poikiloderma.

#### G. Cataract Associated with Syndromes
*   **[[Myotonic Dystrophy]]**: **Christmas Tree Cataract** (polychromatic crystals),.
*   **[[Down Syndrome]]**: Punctate subcapsular opacities.

### 3. Classification by Maturity (Stage of Development)
This classification is primarily used for **Cortical Senile Cataract**.

| Stage | Features | Iris Shadow Test |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Lamellar Separation** | Water clefts and vacuoles; earliest sign. | Absent |
| **2. Incipient** | Cuneiform (wedge-shaped) spokes or Cupuliform opacities. | Present |
| **3. Immature (ISC)** | Opacification incomplete; clear cortex present. Lens may be swollen (**Intumescent**). | **Present** |
| **4. Mature (MSC)** | Complete opacification; Lens is pearly white. | **Absent** |
| **5. Hypermature (HMSC)** | Cortex disintegrates. Two types: <br> 1. **[[Morgagnian Cataract]]**: Liquefied cortex, nucleus sinks to bottom. <br> 2. **Sclerotic**: Shrunken, inspissated lens. | Absent |

**Clinical Implication:**
> **[[Intumescent Cataract]]** (Swollen lens) can lead to **Phacomorphic Glaucoma** (Secondary Angle Closure).
> **[[Morgagnian Cataract]]** can lead to **Phacolytic Glaucoma** (Secondary Open Angle) due to leaked lens proteins clogging the trabecular meshwork,.

### 4. Classification of Nuclear Sclerosis (Color Grading)
As nuclear cataract progresses, the lens nucleus becomes harder and changes color due to urochrome pigment deposition,.

1.  **Cataracta Brunescens:** Brown nucleus.
2.  **Cataracta Nigra:** Black nucleus.
3.  **Cataracta Rubra:** Reddish nucleus.

**Mnemonics:**
*   **Causes of Posterior Subcapsular Cataract:** **"MNC Repay SST"**
    *   **M**yotonic dystrophy
    *   **N**eurofibromatosis
    *   **C**omplicated cataract
    *   **R**adiation (X-rays)
    *   **S**teroids (Systemic)
    *   **S**unlight (UV)
    *   **T**rauma (Blunt)

*   **Complicated Cataract Causes:** **"UMAR"**
    *   **U**veitis
    *   **M**yopia (High)
    *   **A**ngle closure glaucoma (Glaucomflecken)
    *   **R**etinitis Pigmentosa
