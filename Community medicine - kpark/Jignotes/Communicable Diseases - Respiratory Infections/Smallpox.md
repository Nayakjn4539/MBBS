# [[Communicable Diseases - Respiratory Infections]] > Smallpox

# [[Smallpox]] (Variola)

[[Smallpox]] was an acute, highly infectious viral disease that has the unique distinction of being the **first and only disease to be completely eradicated from the world**. Although extinct, it remains relevant due to the threat of bioterrorism and the lessons learned from its eradication strategy.

### Epidemiological Determinants

*   **Agent Factor:** Caused by [[Variola virus]] (Orthopoxvirus). It had two variants: *Variola major* (severe, 20-50% fatality) and *Variola minor* (mild, <1% fatality).
*   **Natural Host:** **Humans were the only reservoir**. There was no animal reservoir.
*   **Source of Infection:** A case of smallpox. **Carriers were not known to occur**.
*   **Transmission:**
    *   **Direct:** Droplet infection (face-to-face contact).
    *   **Indirect:** Fomites (infected clothing/bedding) and bodily fluids.
*   **Incubation Period:** 7–17 days (Average 12 days).
*   **Period of Communicability:** Highly infectious. From the development of the first lesion until the last scab fell off (approx. 3 weeks).

### Clinical Picture

The disease presented with a sudden onset of high fever, headache, backache, and vomiting. The characteristic rash appeared on the 3rd or 4th day.

**Rash Characteristics (Crucial for diagnosis):**
*   **Centrifugal Distribution:** Rash was dense on the face and extremities (palms and soles involved), and sparse on the trunk.
*   **Evolution:** Slow and majestic. Macule $\rightarrow$ Papule $\rightarrow$ Vesicle $\rightarrow$ Pustule $\rightarrow$ Scab.
*   **Monomorphic:** All lesions in a given area were at the **same stage of development**.
*   **Nature:** Deep-seated, multilocular, and shotty (felt like hard peas under the skin).

### Comparison: Smallpox vs. [[Chickenpox]] (High Yield)

| Feature | Smallpox (Variola) | Chickenpox (Varicella) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Distribution** | **Centrifugal** (Face/Extremities) | **Centripetal** (Trunk) |
| **Palms/Soles** | Frequently involved | Usually spared |
| **Axilla** | Spared | Affected |
| **Evolution** | Slow (Same stage in one area) | Rapid (Pleomorphic - all stages seen together) |
| **Lesion Depth** | Deep-seated, multilocular | Superficial, unilocular ("Dew drop on rose petal") |
| **Fever** | Subsides when rash appears | Rises with each crop of rash |

### The Eradication of Smallpox

This is the greatest triumph in public health history. The global campaign by [[WHO]] utilized the strategy of **Surveillance and Containment** (Search and Destroy) rather than just mass vaccination.

#### **Important Milestone Dates:**
1.  **Last Indigenous Case in India:** 17th May 1975 (Purnea district, Bihar).
2.  **Last Known Case in India:** 24th May 1975 (Imported from Bangladesh).
3.  **India Declared Smallpox Free:** April 1977 (by International Commission).
4.  **Last Case Globally:** 26th October 1977 (Somalia) — *Variola minor*.
5.  **Global Eradication Declared:** **8th May 1980** (World Health Assembly).

#### **Epidemiological Basis for Eradication (The "Why")**
Smallpox had specific features that made it a candidate for eradication.

**Mnemonic: NO CHANCE**
*   **N**o animal reservoir.
*   **O**bvious diagnosis: Easy detection due to characteristic rash.
*   **C**arrier state absent: No long-term carriers.
*   **H**ighly effective vaccine: Freeze-dried vaccine was stable and potent.
*   **A**cquired immunity was lifelong.
*   **N**o subclinical transmission: Subclinical cases did not transmit disease.
*   **C**ooperation: International cooperation was strong.
*   **E**pidemiology: Slow transmission allowed time for containment.

### Vaccination (Historical Context)
*   **First Vaccine:** Developed by **[[Edward Jenner]]** in 1796 (First vaccine ever discovered).
*   **Method:** Bifurcated needle used for multiple puncture technique.
*   **Strain:** Freeze-dried vaccine (Lyophilized).
*   **Current Status:** Routine vaccination stopped globally in 1980. Currently, stocks are held only in USA and Russia for research.

### Clinical Relevance: Bioterrorism
Smallpox is a **Category A** bioterrorism agent. Because routine vaccination stopped decades ago, the population is now highly susceptible. Even a **single case** of smallpox today is considered a global health emergency.
