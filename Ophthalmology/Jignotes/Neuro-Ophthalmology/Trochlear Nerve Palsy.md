# [[Neuro-Ophthalmology]] > Trochlear Nerve Palsy

# [[Trochlear Nerve Palsy]] (CN IV Palsy)

### Anatomical Basis
The [[Trochlear Nerve]] (CN IV) has unique anatomical features that make it susceptible to specific types of injury.

*   **Nucleus:** Located in the midbrain at the level of the [[Inferior Colliculus]].
*   **Unique Features:**
    1.  **Dorsal Exit:** It is the *only* cranial nerve to emerge from the dorsal aspect of the brainstem.
    2.  **Decussation:** It is the *only* cranial nerve to decussate (cross) completely. Thus, the nucleus supplies the **contralateral** [[Superior Oblique Muscle]].
    3.  **Course:** It has the longest intracranial course and is the most slender cranial nerve.
*   **Path:** Winds around the cerebral peduncle $\rightarrow$ passes between posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries $\rightarrow$ runs in the lateral wall of the [[Cavernous Sinus]] $\rightarrow$ enters orbit via the **Superior Orbital Fissure** (outside the [[Annulus of Zinn]]).
*   **Innervation:** Supplies the [[Superior Oblique Muscle]] (SO).

### Physiology: Action of Superior Oblique
To understand the palsy, one must recall the normal action of the muscle.

| Action Type | Movement | Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary** | **Intorsion** | Prevention of extorsion |
| **Secondary** | **Depression** | Maximal when eye is **Adducted** (51°) |
| **Tertiary** | **Abduction** | Moves eye outward |

**Mnemonic:** **SO4** (Superior Oblique is 4th Nerve)
**Mnemonic:** **SIN** (Superiors are IN-torters)

### Etiology
Due to its long intracranial course, it is highly susceptible to trauma.

1.  **Congenital:** Very common (often presents with decompensation later in life).
    *   Associated with long-standing compensatory head tilt.
2.  **Trauma:** Most common cause of acquired vertical strabismus (e.g., closed head injury, whiplash injury).
    *   Because of the dorsal exit and decussation near the tentorium, it is prone to shear injury.
3.  **Vascular (Microvascular ischemia):** Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension (common in elderly, often resolves spontaneously).
4.  **Tumors:** Rare (e.g., pinealoma affecting dorsal midbrain).

### Clinical Features
The clinical presentation is opposite to the normal action of the muscle.

#### 1. Symptoms
*   **Vertical Diplopia:** Patients complain of seeing two images, one above the other.
*   **Worsening of Symptoms:** Diplopia is worse on **looking down** (e.g., reading, walking down stairs) and usually worse on looking to the **contralateral side**.
*   **Asthenopia:** Eye strain due to constant effort to fuse images.

#### 2. Signs
*   **Squint (Strabismus):**
    *   **[[Hypertropia]]:** The affected eye is higher (due to loss of depression).
    *   **Excyclotorsion:** The eye rotates outward (due to loss of intorsion).
    *   **Esotropia:** Mild convergence (due to loss of abduction function).
*   **Restriction of Movement:** Limitation of depression in **adduction**.
*   **Abnormal Head Posture (Ocular Torticollis):** This is a compensatory mechanism to avoid diplopia.
    *   **Head Tilt:** To the **OPPOSITE** shoulder (Contralateral tilt).
        *   *Mechanism:* Tilting to the opposite side requires the normal eye to intort and the affected eye to extort. Since the affected eye is already extorted (due to palsy), this aligns the eyes. Tilting to the *same* side requires the affected eye to intort (function of paralyzed SO), causing massive strain and separation of images.
    *   **Chin Depression:** To avoid the downgaze field where diplopia is worst.
    *   **Face Turn:** To the opposite side.

**Clinical Implication:** A patient with Right SO palsy will tilt their head to the **Left**.

### Diagnostic Tests

#### 1. Park's Three-Step Test
This is the gold standard for diagnosing cyclovertical muscle palsies.

*   **Step 1: Identify Hypertropia in Primary Gaze.**
    *   Which eye is higher? (e.g., Right Hypertropia implies weakness of R-depressors [R-SO, R-IR] or L-elevators [L-SR, L-IO]).
*   **Step 2: Identify Gaze Lateralization.**
    *   Is deviation worse on left or right gaze?
    *   In SO palsy, hypertropia increases on **contralateral gaze** (gaze into the field of action).
    *   *Example:* Right Hypertropia worse on Left Gaze points to R-SO or L-SR.
*   **Step 3: Bielschowsky's Head Tilt Test.**
    *   Is deviation worse on tilting head right or left?
    *   **Positive Sign:** Hypertropia increases on tilting the head to the **IPSILATERAL** (affected) side.
    *   *Mechanism:* Vestibular system stimulates intorsion on ipsilateral tilt. The SO (intorter) is weak, so the Superior Rectus (the other intorter) fires. The SR is also an elevator, but the SO (depressor) cannot counteract the elevation. Result: Eye shoots up.

| Condition (e.g., Right SO Palsy) | Observation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Gaze** | Right Hypertropia |
| **Lateral Gaze** | Worse on Left Gaze (Adduction) |
| **Head Tilt** | Worse on Right Tilt (Ipsilateral) |

#### 2. Double Maddox Rod Test
*   Used to measure **cyclotorsion** (torsional deviation).
*   The patient aligns two lines of light; the degree of rotation required indicates the amount of excyclotorsion.

#### 3. Hess Screen/Lees Screen
*   Used to document the deviation and sequelae.
*   **Sequelae of Paralysis:**
    1.  Overaction of ipsilateral [[Inferior Oblique]] (Antagonist).
    2.  Contracture of ipsilateral [[Superior Rectus]].
    3.  Secondary inhibitional palsy of contralateral [[Inferior Rectus]].

---

### Differential Diagnosis
*   **Skew Deviation:** Due to brainstem/cerebellar lesions (usually associated with other neurological signs).
*   **Myasthenia Gravis:** Can mimic any ocular palsy.
*   **Thyroid Eye Disease:** Restrictive myopathy (specifically Superior Rectus restriction mimicking contralateral IR palsy).
*   **Brown's Syndrome:** Mechanical restriction of the SO tendon (eye cannot elevate in adduction; reverse of SO palsy).

---

### Management

#### 1. Medical/Conservative
*   **Observation:** For acquired ischemic palsies (often resolve in 3-6 months).
*   **Prisms:** Base-down prism in front of the hypertropic eye to correct small vertical deviations.
*   **Occlusion:** Patching one eye to eliminate intractable diplopia.

#### 2. Surgical
Indicated if no recovery after 6 months or significant congenital deviation.

**Goals:** Eliminate diplopia in primary position and downgaze, correct head posture.

| Procedure | Indication | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inferior Oblique Weakening** | Moderate hypertropia with IO overaction | Recession or Myectomy of the ipsilateral antagonist. |
| **Superior Oblique Tucking** | Lax tendon (common in congenital) | Plicating the tendon to strengthen the paretic muscle. |
| **Harada-Ito Procedure** | Significant **Excyclotorsion** | Splitting and anterior transposition of the anterior fibers of SO tendon (enhances intorsion). |
| **Contralateral IR Recession** | Large deviation | Weakens the yoke muscle. |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
