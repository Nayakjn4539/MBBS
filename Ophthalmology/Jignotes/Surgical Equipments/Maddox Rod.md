# Maddox Rod

### Definition and Introduction
The **Maddox Rod** is an essential handheld ophthalmic instrument utilized primarily for the diagnosis and measurement of [[Heterophoria]] (latent squint) and [[Heterotropia]] (manifest squint). It is a subjective test that relies on the patient's response to dissimilar images presented to each eye.

### Optical Principle
*   **Refraction by Cylinders:** The device consists of a series of red or colorless parallel high-power **planoconvex cylindrical lenses** (glass rods) mounted in a frame or disc.
*   **Image Formation:** When a point source of light passes through a cylindrical lens, rays are converged in the meridian of curvature but pass undeviated along the axis. Consequently, a point source of light is converted into a **linear streak (line) of light** oriented **perpendicular** to the axis of the cylinder.
    *   **Vertical Axis** $\rightarrow$ Horizontal Line.
    *   **Horizontal Axis** $\rightarrow$ Vertical Line.
*   **Dissociation of Eyes:** The fundamental principle is **dissociation**. By presenting a point of light to one eye and a red streak to the other, the images are so dissimilar that the brain cannot fuse them. This disrupts the **fusion reflex**, allowing the eyes to assume their position of rest, thereby unmasking any latent deviation ([[Heterophoria]]).

### Indications and Clinical Uses
1.  **Diagnosis of Heterophoria:** To detect latent deviations for distance (6 meters) and near (33 cm).
2.  **Measurement of Deviation:** Quantifying the angle of deviation when used in conjunction with prisms.
3.  **Diagnosis of Heterotropia:** In cases of manifest squint with diplopia.
4.  **Assessment of Cyclodeviation:** Using the **Double Maddox Rod test**.
5.  **Macular Function Test:** Used in eyes with hazy media (e.g., [[Cataract]]). If the patient can perceive a continuous, straight red line, it indicates fair macular function. A broken or distorted line suggests macular pathology.

### Procedure
The test is typically performed in a semi-dark room.
1.  The patient fixes on a bright point light source at **6 meters** (distance) or **33 cm** (near).
2.  The Maddox Rod (usually red) is placed in the trial frame or held before the **Right Eye**.
3.  The Left Eye views the white spotlight, while the Right Eye views the red line.
4.  The orientation of the rod is adjusted based on the deviation being tested.

#### 1. Testing Horizontal Deviation
*   **Rod Orientation:** Placed **Horizontally**.
*   **Image Seen:** A **Vertical** red line.
*   **Interpretation:** The position of the red line relative to the white light determines the diagnosis.

| Condition | Perception (Patient's View) | Type of Diplopia | Correction (Prism Base) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Orthophoria** | Red line runs **through** the light | None | None |
| **Esophoria / Esotropia** | Red line is on the **Right** (Same side as rod) | **Uncrossed** (Homonymous) | Base Out (BO) |
| **Exophoria / Exotropia** | Red line is on the **Left** (Opposite side) | **Crossed** (Heteronymous) | Base In (BI) |

#### 2. Testing Vertical Deviation
*   **Rod Orientation:** Placed **Vertically**.
*   **Image Seen:** A **Horizontal** red line.
*   **Interpretation:** Assuming the rod is over the **Right Eye**.

| Condition | Perception (Patient's View) | Interpretation | Correction (Prism Base) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Orthophoria** | Red line passes **through** the light | No deviation | None |
| **Right Hyperphoria** | Red line is **Below** the light | Right eye is deviated Up (Image projected down) | Base Down (BD) in front of RE |
| **Right Hypophoria** (Left Hyperphoria) | Red line is **Above** the light | Right eye is deviated Down (Image projected up) | Base Up (BU) in front of RE |

**Mnemonic for Interpretation:**
*   **CL**-**US**: **C**rossed = **L**ateral (Exo); **U**ncrossed = **S**ame side (Eso) [In reference to Diplopia].
*   "The image is always opposite to the deviation." If the eye goes **UP** (Hyper), the image goes **DOWN**.

### Double Maddox Rod Test
Used to detect **Cyclotropia** (Torsional deviation).
*   **Setup:** A red Maddox rod is placed before the right eye and a white (or different color) Maddox rod before the left eye.
*   **Orientation:** Both rods are placed vertically in a trial frame to produce two horizontal lines.
*   **Procedure:** The patient is asked if the lines are parallel. If tilted, the patient (or examiner) rotates the rod until the lines appear parallel.
*   **Result:** The degree of rotation required indicates the amount of [[Cyclophoria]] or [[Cyclotropia]].

### Clinical Implications
*   **Macular Function:** In patients with dense [[Cataract]] where the fundus cannot be visualized, the Maddox Rod serves as an **Entoptic phenomenon** test. If the patient sees a fragmented or broken line, it suggests [[Macular Disease]] or [[Amblyopia]] rather than a simple opacity.
*   **Latent Squint:** It is one of the most reliable tests for **decompensated phoria**. However, because it completely dissociates the eyes, it measures the *total* deviation (latent + manifest), which may sometimes be larger than what is seen on the cover test.
