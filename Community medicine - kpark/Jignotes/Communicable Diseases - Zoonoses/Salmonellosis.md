# Salmonellosis

Salmonellosis is a major [[Zoonosis]] and a complex group of foodborne infections affecting both humans and animals. It is a leading cause of "Food Poisoning" worldwide.

### Epidemiological Determinants

#### 1. Agent Factors
*   **Agent:** **Salmonella species** (Gram-negative, non-sporing, non-capsulated rods).
*   **Classification:**
    *   **Group 1:** Infects only man (e.g., *S. typhi*, *S. paratyphi A* & *C*) causing [[Enteric Fever]].
    *   **Group 2:** Host-adapted to animals (e.g., *S. cholera-suis* in swine, *S. dublin* in cattle). Can be pathogenic to man.
    *   **Group 3:** **Zoonotic serotypes** (No host preference). These are the principal agents of Salmonellosis food poisoning.
        *   Most common: **[[S. typhimurium]]**, **[[S. enteritidis]]**.
*   **Resistance:**
    *   Resistant to **freezing**, salting, and smoking (survives in ice cream/frozen meat).
    *   **Heat Sensitive:** Killed by temperatures above **70° C** (pasteurization kills them).
    *   Multi-drug resistant strains are emerging (e.g., to fluoroquinolones).

#### 2. Reservoir and Source
*   **Natural Host:** Intestinal tract of **man and animals**.
*   **Animal Reservoir:** Poultry (fowls, ducks, turkeys), cattle, swine, rodents, and pets (dogs, cats).
*   **Source of Infection:**
    *   **Foods of Animal Origin:** Contaminated meat, **poultry**, **eggs** (cracked shells or ovarian infection in hen), milk and milk products (ice cream, cheese).
    *   **Cross-contamination:** Raw ingredients contaminating cooked foods via kitchen utensils.
    *   **Carriers:** Human or animal carriers shedding bacilli in feces.

#### 3. Transmission
*   **Fecal-Oral Route:** Ingestion of contaminated food or drink.
*   **Direct Contact:** Handling infected animals (poultry, livestock, pets).
*   **Cross-contamination:** Cooked food contaminated by raw food, fingers, or flies.

### Pathogenesis and Clinical Picture

**Incubation Period:**
*   **Range:** 6 to 72 hours.
*   **Commonly:** **12 to 24 hours**.

**Clinical Syndromes:**
Salmonella infection can manifest in three ways:

1.  **Salmonella Gastroenteritis (Food Poisoning):**
    *   **Most common manifestation** of zoonotic salmonellosis.
    *   **Onset:** Sudden.
    *   **Symptoms:** Nausea, headache, vomiting, profuse watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and low-grade fever.
    *   **Course:** Usually resolves in 2–3 days.
    *   **Stools:** Loose, offensive, may contain mucus/blood.
2.  **Septicemia with Focal Lesions:**
    *   Invades bloodstream leading to pyrexia of unknown origin.
    *   Can cause osteomyelitis, meningitis, or endocarditis.
3.  **Enteric Fever:**
    *   Caused by *S. typhi* (Human pathogen, not zoonotic) or *S. paratyphi B* (Can be zoonotic).

**Clinical Relevance:**
> *Salmonella* food poisoning differs from *Staphylococcal* food poisoning primarily by the presence of **Fever** (rare in Staph) and a longer incubation period (>12 hours vs 1-6 hours for Staph).

### Diagnosis

*   **Stool Culture:** Positive for Salmonella; remains positive for weeks after recovery.
*   **Blood Culture:** Usually negative in gastroenteritis; positive in septicemia/enteric fever.
*   **Serology:** Identification of specific serotypes.

### Treatment

1.  **Rehydration:** Replacement of fluids and electrolytes ([[ORS]] or IV fluids) is the mainstay of management for gastroenteritis.
2.  **Antibiotics:**
    *   **Contraindicated** in uncomplicated gastroenteritis (may prolong the carrier state/excretion of organisms).
    *   **Indicated** only for: Septicemia, severe illness, infants, elderly, or immunocompromised patients.
    *   **Drugs:** Ampicillin, Chloramphenicol, TMP-SMX, Ciprofloxacin (resistance is common).

### Prevention and Control

Since it is a zoonosis, prevention must cover the entire food chain ("Farm to Fork").

| Level | Preventive Measures |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Animals (Farm)** | • **Immunization** of farm animals.<br>• Use of hygienic animal feed (Salmonella-free).<br>• Sanitary environment for animals. |
| **Processing** | • Hygienic slaughtering and milking.<br>• **[[Pasteurization]]** of milk and eggs.<br>• Proper disposal of wastes. |
| **Consumption** | • Thorough **cooking** of food (ensure no cool spots).<br>• Prevent cross-contamination (separate raw and cooked food).<br>• **Refrigeration** of food (prevents bacterial multiplication).<br>• Personal hygiene of food handlers (Hand washing). |

### Mnemonics for Exam

**Mnemonic for Symptoms: "SALMON"**
*   **S** - Stools (Watery/Bloody)
*   **A** - Abdominal Cramps
*   **L** - Low-grade Fever (Distinguishes from Staph)
*   **M** - Meats/Milk/Mayo (Common sources)
*   **O** - Onset 12-24 hours
*   **N** - Nausea & Vomiting

*Draw a cycle connecting:*
1.  **Reservoir:** Poultry/Cattle/Rodents.
2.  **Mode:** Feces $\rightarrow$ Food/Milk/Water $\rightarrow$ Ingestion.
3.  **Host:** Man (Gastroenteritis).
*Include "Cycle of contamination" showing raw meat contaminating knives/cutting boards which then contaminate salad/cooked food.*
