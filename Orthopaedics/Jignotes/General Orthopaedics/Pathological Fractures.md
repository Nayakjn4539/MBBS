# [[General Orthopaedics]] > Pathological Fractures

### Definition
A [[Pathological fracture]] is a fracture that occurs in a bone that has been weakened by an underlying disease or a change in its structure. These fractures often occur spontaneously or following trivial trauma (force insufficient to break a normal bone).

### Etiology and Classification
Causes are broadly classified into generalized bone disorders and localized benign or malignant conditions.

**Table 1: Causes of Pathological Fractures**

| Category | Conditions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Generalized Bone Diseases** | • [[Osteoporosis]] (Most common cause)<br>• [[Osteogenesis imperfecta]] (Brittle bone disease)<br>• [[Paget's disease]] of bone (Osteitis deformans)<br>• [[Osteomalacia]] / [[Rickets]]<br>• [[Hyperparathyroidism]]<br>• [[Disuse atrophy]] (in Polio)<br>• [[Osteopetrosis]] (Marble bone disease) |
| **Localized Benign Conditions** | • [[Solitary bone cyst]] (Unicameral bone cyst)<br>• [[Aneurysmal bone cyst]]<br>• [[Giant cell tumor]]<br>• [[Chondroma]] / [[Enchondroma]]<br>• [[Fibrous dysplasia]] (Monostotic or Polyostotic)<br>• [[Chronic osteomyelitis]] |
| **Malignant Conditions** | • [[Metastatic bone disease]] (Secondaries from Breast, Prostate, Lung, Kidney, Thyroid)<br>• [[Multiple myeloma]]<br>• Primary bone sarcomas (e.g., [[Osteosarcoma]], [[Ewing's sarcoma]]) |

### Common Sites
*   **Vertebrae:** Thoracic and lumbar vertebral bodies (Compression fractures).
*   **Femur:** Neck of femur and proximal shaft.
*   **Humerus:** Proximal half.
*   **Radius:** Distal end (often associated with osteoporosis).
*   **Ribs**.

### Clinical Features
*   **History:** The patient may report a fracture occurring spontaneously or after minor stress (e.g., turning in bed, coughing, or a minor fall).
*   **Prodromal Symptoms:** There is often a history of pre-existing pain, discomfort, or swelling in the affected bone prior to the fracture.
*   **Systemic History:** History of primary malignancy (breast, lung, prostate, etc.), weight loss, or constitutional symptoms.
*   **General Examination:** May reveal signs of the primary pathology, such as a breast lump, thyroid nodule, or lymphadenopathy.

### Diagnostic Work-up
**1. Radiological Examination (X-ray)**
*   Shows the fracture line, often transverse (chalk-stick fracture).
*   Reveals the underlying bone pathology:
    *   **Lytic lesions:** Bone destruction, cortical erosion, or "moth-eaten" appearance suggest malignancy.
    *   **Cystic appearance:** Suggests simple or aneurysmal bone cysts.
    *   **Generalized rarefaction:** Suggests [[Osteoporosis]] or [[Osteomalacia]].
    *   **Cortical thickening/trabeculation:** Suggests [[Paget's disease]].

**2. Advanced Imaging**
*   **[[Bone Scan]] (Scintigraphy):** To screen the entire skeleton for other deposits ("hot spots") in cases of suspected metastasis or [[Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia]].
*   **[[MRI]] and [[CT Scan]]:** Essential to determine the extent of bone destruction, soft tissue involvement, and to evaluate the spine for cord compression.

**3. Biopsy**
*   Essential for diagnosis if the primary cause is unknown. Can be done prior to or during fixation.

**4. Laboratory Investigations**
*   Serum Calcium, Phosphate, Alkaline Phosphatase (elevated in Paget’s, Mets).
*   Serum Electrophoresis (for [[Multiple Myeloma]]).
*   Tumor markers (PSA for prostate, etc.).

### Risk Stratification: Mirels' Criteria
This scoring system is used to predict the risk of pathological fracture in impending lesions (specifically metastatic) and to guide **Prophylactic Fixation**.

**Table 2: Mirels' Scoring System**

| Score | Site | Pain | Lesion Type | Size (Cortical involvement) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Upper Limb | Mild | Blastic | < 1/3 width |
| **2** | Lower Limb | Moderate | Mixed | 1/3 – 2/3 width |
| **3** | Peritrochanteric | Severe (Functional) | Lytic | > 2/3 width |

**Clinical Implication:**
*   **Score ≤ 7:** Can be observed / Radiotherapy.
*   **Score > 7 (or ≥ 8):** High risk of fracture; requires **Prophylactic Internal Fixation**.

### Management Principles
The goal is to relieve pain, restore function, and facilitate nursing care.

**1. Benign Conditions**
*   Fractures through benign cysts (e.g., Simple Bone Cyst) usually heal well.
*   **Strategy:** Allow the fracture to heal with conservative management (splinting), then treat the underlying lesion (curettage/excision) later.

**2. Malignant / Metastatic Conditions**
*   These fractures rarely unite without intervention. Surgical stabilization is usually required.
*   **Internal Fixation:**
    *   **Long Bones:** Intramedullary nails are preferred over plates. The construct should span the entire bone to protect against future lesions.
    *   **Bone Cement:** [[Polymethylmethacrylate]] (PMMA) cement is often used to fill defects and augment screw/implant fixation in poor-quality bone.
*   **Prosthetic Replacement:** For fractures near bone ends (e.g., Femoral neck), excision of the head/neck and replacement with a prosthesis is preferred over fixation.
*   **Radiotherapy:** Post-operative local irradiation is often given to control tumor growth and relieve pain.

**3. Spinal Pathological Fractures**
*   Risk of spinal cord compression.
*   Treatment includes bracing or surgical decompression and stabilization (if unstable or neurological deficit exists).

### Fracture Healing Prognosis
*   **Traumatic Fractures:** Have a predictable outcome and usually unite.
*   **Pathological Fractures:**
    *   **Benign:** Usually unite (e.g., [[Paget's disease]], [[Osteogenesis imperfecta]]).
    *   **Malignant:** Often go into **[[Non-union]]** unless the tumor is treated with chemotherapy/radiotherapy or stabilized surgically.
