# [[Sexual Jurisprudence]] > medicolegal aspects of Pregnancy

### **Pregnancy: Medicolegal Aspects**

**Pregnancy** is a physiological state occurring in a woman due to fertilization of the ovum by a spermatozoon and subsequent embedding of the fertilized ovum into the uterine cavity. From a medicolegal perspective, the determination of pregnancy is crucial in civil and criminal cases involving status, responsibility, and rights.

### **Medicolegal Importance of Pregnancy**

The determination of pregnancy is required in the following situations:

**1. Civil Cases:**
*   **Nullity of Marriage:** If a woman is pregnant at the time of marriage by a person other than the husband, and this fact was concealed from the husband, the marriage can be declared voidable.
*   **Divorce/Adultery:** If a woman becomes pregnant while living apart from her husband without access to him, it serves as proof of [[Adultery]].
*   **Legitimacy and Paternity:** To determine the inheritance rights of the child.
*   **Succession of Property:** A woman may feign pregnancy after her husband's death to retain control over his estate or to claim a larger share of inheritance.
*   **Compensation:** If a pregnant woman's husband dies due to someone else's negligence (e.g., an accident), she may claim higher compensation for the unborn child.

**2. Criminal Cases:**
*   **Rape:** Pregnancy may be a consequence of [[Rape]], serving as corroborative evidence of sexual intercourse.
*   **Abortion/Infanticide:** Proof of recent pregnancy is essential to establish charges of criminal [[Abortion]] or [[Infanticide]].
*   **Capital Punishment (Stay of Execution):** Under **Section 416 CrPC** (Criminal Procedure Code), if a woman sentenced to death is found to be pregnant, the High Court shall commute the sentence to life imprisonment. The logic is that the innocent fetus should not be punished for the mother's crime.
*   **Kidnapping/Abduction:** A minor girl may be abducted and impregnated.
*   **Witness Excuse:** A woman may plead pregnancy to avoid attending court as a witness (valid only in advanced stages where travel is risky).

### **Diagnosis of Pregnancy**

For legal purposes, signs of pregnancy are classified into three categories. Only **Positive Signs** are accepted as conclusive proof in a court of law.

| Sign Category | Nature | Features | Medicolegal Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Presumptive Signs** | Subjective (Symptoms) | • Amenorrhea (cessation of menses)<br>• Morning sickness (nausea/vomiting)<br>• Urinary frequency<br>• Breast changes (enlargement, pigmentation)<br>• Quickening (feeling fetal movements ~18-20 weeks) | **Unreliable.** Can be feigned or due to other diseases. |
| **Probable Signs** | Objective (Physical signs) | • Abdominal enlargement<br>• Uterine changes (Hegar’s sign, Goodell’s sign)<br>• Breast secretion (Colostrum)<br>• Braxton-Hicks contractions<br>• Positive immunological urine tests (hCG) | **High probability**, but can be caused by tumors (fibroids) or hydatidiform mole. |
| **Positive Signs** | Conclusive (Undeniable) | • **Fetal Heart Sounds (FHS):** Heard by stethoscope/Doppler.<br>• **Palpation of Fetal Parts:** By the examiner.<br>• **Fetal Movements:** Felt by the examiner.<br>• **Radiological/USG evidence:** Visualization of gestational sac/skeleton. | **Accepted as Proof** in court. |

> **Mnemonic for Signs:**
> *   **P**resumptive = **P**atient says (Subjective)
> *   **P**robable = **P**hysician feels (Objective but not sure)
> *   **P**ositive = **P**roof (Conclusive)

### **Special Medicolegal Concepts Related to Pregnancy**

#### **1. Pseudocyesis (Spurious/Phantom Pregnancy)**
*   **Definition:** A condition where a woman firmly believes she is pregnant and develops objective signs (amenorrhea, morning sickness, abdominal enlargement due to fat/gas, breast secretion) in the absence of conception.
*   **Cause:** Psychosomatic (intense desire to have a child or fear of pregnancy).
*   **Examination:** Uterus is normal size/empty on USG. Under anesthesia, the abdominal enlargement (phantom tumor) disappears.
*   **Medicolegal Aspect:** Used for blackmail, preventing desertion by husband, or leniency in criminal sentences.

#### **2. Superfecundation**
*   **Definition:** The fertilization of **two separate ova** released during the **same menstrual cycle** by two separate acts of coitus within a short interval (hours to days).
*   **Result:** Twins of different paternity (e.g., one white and one black twin if partners are of different races).
*   **Medicolegal Aspect:** Disputed [[Paternity]] and inheritance.

#### **3. Superfetation**
*   **Definition:** Fertilization of a second ovum in an **already pregnant woman** (during a different menstrual cycle). This implies ovulation during pregnancy.
*   **Status:** Theoretically impossible in humans because the decidua capsularis closes the uterine cavity after the 4th month and hormonal inhibition prevents ovulation.
*   **Result:** Delivery of two fetuses of significantly different ages/developmental stages.
*   **Medicolegal Aspect:** Often cited as a defense in adultery/legitimacy cases but rarely accepted scientifically.

#### **4. Supposititious Child**
*   **Definition:** A woman feigns pregnancy and delivery, then produces a child (borrowed or bought) claiming it as her own.
*   **Motive:** To extort money, inherit property, or claim legitimacy.
*   **Diagnosis:** Examination of the woman reveals signs of nulliparity (breasts, abdomen, and genitalia show no changes of recent delivery).

#### **5. Posthumous Child**
*   **Definition:** A child born after the death of the father.
*   **Medicolegal Aspect:**
    *   **Legitimacy:** The child is legitimate if born within **280 days** of the dissolution of marriage (death of father), provided the mother remains unmarried (Sec 112, Indian Evidence Act).
    *   **Inheritance:** Disputes often arise regarding the share of property.

### **Examination of a Pregnant Woman**

**Consent:** [[Informed Consent]] is mandatory. Examining a woman against her will constitutes assault.

**Physical Examination:**
*   **Breasts:** Pigmentation of areola, Montgomery's tubercles, colostrum.
*   **Abdomen:** Linea nigra, striae gravidarum, height of uterus (fundal height).
*   **Per Vaginam (PV):** Chadwick’s sign (bluish discoloration of cervix/vagina), os softening.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Diagram showing fundal height at different weeks of gestation (e.g., at symphysis pubis at 12 weeks, umbilicus at 24 weeks) is essential here.

### **Autopsy Findings in Pregnancy**

If a woman dies while pregnant or due to criminal abortion:
1.  **Uterus:** Enlarged, congested.
2.  **Internal Contents:** Presence of fetus, placenta, membranes.
3.  **Ovaries:** Presence of **Corpus Luteum** of pregnancy (confirmatory).
4.  **Products of Conception:** Should be preserved for DNA analysis (paternity testing) in cases of rape/incest.
5.  **Age of Fetus:** Determined by length (Haase’s Rule) and ossification centers to estimate time of conception.
