# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Significant numbers of cases of jaundice were reported from an urban locality. As a health expert how do you investigate it & what remedial measures do you suggest for the problems?

### Investigation of Jaundice Outbreak

An outbreak of [[Jaundice]] in an urban locality typically points towards a **water-borne** etiology, most commonly **Hepatitis A** or **Hepatitis E**. The investigation follows a systematic epidemiological approach.

**Mnemonic for Investigation Steps:** **"V**ery **C**areful **P**eople **S**earch **D**ata **H**ypothesis **E**verywhere"
*(Verification, Confirmation, Population, Search, Data analysis, Hypothesis, Environmental evaluation)*

#### 1. Verification of Diagnosis
*   **Clinical Examination:** Examine a sample of cases. Look for prodromal symptoms (fever, anorexia, nausea) followed by dark urine and yellow discoloration of sclera/skin.
*   **Laboratory Confirmation:** Send blood and stool samples to the laboratory.
    *   **Serology:** Test for **IgM Anti-HAV** (Hepatitis A) and **IgM Anti-HEV** (Hepatitis E) to confirm acute infection.
    *   **Liver Function Tests:** Check for elevated serum bilirubin and transaminases (ALT/SGPT).
*   **Rule Out:** Leptospirosis or Malaria if clinically indicated, though less likely to cause massive urban clustering compared to viral hepatitis.

#### 2. Confirmation of Existence of Epidemic
*   Compare the current number of jaundice cases (observed frequency) with the incidence during the same period in previous years (expected frequency).
*   If the current number is clearly in excess of normal expectancy (usually **> Mean + 2 Standard Deviations**), an epidemic is confirmed.

#### 3. Defining the Population at Risk
*   **Mapping:** Obtain a map of the urban locality. Mark the distribution of water supply lines, sewage pipes, and open drains.
*   **Census:** Estimate the total population in the affected area to calculate attack rates.

#### 4. Rapid Search for Cases
*   **Active Surveillance:** Deploy health workers for house-to-house surveys to identify mild, missed, or non-reported cases.
*   **Case Definition:** Establish a working definition (e.g., "Any person with yellow eyes or dark urine in the last 3 weeks").

#### 5. Data Analysis (Time, Place, Person)
*   **Time:** Construct an **Epidemic Curve**.
    *   A [[Point Source Epidemic]] (sharp rise and fall) suggests a single contamination event.
    *   A continuous source epidemic suggests ongoing contamination (e.g., a leaking sewage pipe mixing with water supply).
    *   > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Epidemic Curve showing Point Source vs Continuous Source
*   **Place:** Prepare a **Spot Map**. Clustering of cases around a specific water pump or standpost indicates the source.
*   **Person:** Analyze age and sex distribution.
    *   *Clinical Relevance:* **Hepatitis A** is common in children; **Hepatitis E** affects young adults (15–40 years) and has high mortality in **pregnant women** (up to 20%).

#### 6. Environmental Evaluation
*   **Water Testing:** Collect water samples from various points (source, distribution lines, household storage).
    *   Test for **Free Residual Chlorine**. (Absence indicates risk).
    *   Test for fecal contamination (Coliform count) using **Presumptive Coliform Test**.
*   **Sanitary Inspection:** Check for cross-connections between water and sewage lines (common in urban slums) or leakage in pipelines.

### Remedial Measures (Control & Prevention)

As a health expert, immediate and long-term measures must be instituted to break the chain of transmission.

#### A. Control of Reservoir (Source)
1.  **Notification:** Report the outbreak immediately to local health authorities.
2.  **Early Diagnosis & Treatment:**
    *   There is no specific antiviral treatment for Hep A or E; management is **supportive** and **symptomatic**.
    *   **Referral:** Hospitalize severe cases, specifically **pregnant women** (suspected Hep E) due to risk of fulminant hepatic failure.
3.  **Isolation:** Enforce **Enteric Precautions**. Isolate cases (prevent sharing of food/utensils) for at least 1 week after onset of jaundice.
4.  **Disinfection:** Concurrent disinfection of feces and urine using **5% Cresol** or bleaching powder.

#### B. Control of Transmission (Sanitation Barrier)
**1. Water Control (Most Important):**
*   **Super-chlorination:** Ensure free residual chlorine levels are **> 0.5 mg/L** (or up to 0.7 mg/L in epidemics) after 1 hour of contact.
*   **Boiling:** Advise the community to drink water only after **boiling for 10-20 minutes**. This effectively kills HAV and HEV.
*   ** Repair:** Immediate repair of leaking pipelines and disconnect cross-connections between sewage and water lines.

**2. Food Hygiene:**
*   Ban the sale of cut fruits, uncovered food, and street food in the affected area temporarily.
*   Encourage consumption of hot, cooked food.

**3. Health Education:**
*   Promote **Hand Washing** with soap after defecation and before eating (the most effective simple measure).
*   Educate regarding the mode of spread (fecal-oral).

#### C. Prevention in Susceptible Host
1.  **Immunization (Hepatitis A):**
    *   **Hepatitis A Vaccine:** Can be considered for outbreak control in closed communities or for high-risk contacts.
    *   **Immunoglobulin (Ig):** For Hepatitis A contacts, human immunoglobulin (0.02 ml/kg) given within 2 weeks of exposure can prevent/modify severity.
2.  **Hepatitis E:** No widely available vaccine; reliance is purely on sanitation and hygiene.

### Summary of Action Plan

| **Category** | **Action Required** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Investigation** | Confirm diagnosis (IgM ELISA), Map cases (Spot Map), Test water quality. |
| **Immediate Control** | Chlorinate water sources, Boil water, Hand hygiene education. |
| **Patient Care** | Supportive therapy, High alert for pregnant women (Hep E risk). |
| **Long Term** | Upgrade sewage disposal, repair water distribution systems. |
