# [[Upper Limb]] > Chauffeur's Fracture and Die-Punch Fracture

# Chauffeur's Fracture and Die-Punch Fracture

These are specific types of intra-articular fractures of the [[distal radius]]. They represent partial articular fractures where a portion of the articular surface is separated from the shaft, while the remainder remains connected.

---

## 1. Chauffeur's Fracture

### Definition
*   Also known as **Hutchinson’s fracture** or **Driver's Fracture** or **Backfire Fracture**.
*   It is an **intra-articular oblique fracture** of the [[radial styloid process]],,.
*   It is considered an avulsion fracture or a shear fracture involving the radial side of the wrist.

### History and Etymology
*   **Origin:** The name is derived from the early days of motoring.
*   **Mechanism:** In old cars, the engine was started using a hand crank. If the engine "backfired" or kicked back, the rotating crank handle would violently strike the **thenar side** (outer side) of the chauffeur's wrist,.
*   This direct blow or forceful **radial deviation** caused the styloid to shear off.

### Mechanism of Injury
1.  **Shearing Force:** The primary mechanism is a shearing force generated by the [[carpus]] (specifically the [[scaphoid]]) impacting against the radial styloid.
2.  **Fall on Outstretched Hand (FOOSH):** A fall with the wrist in **radial deviation** and dorsiflexion causes the scaphoid to act as a wedge, fracturing the styloid.
3.  **Direct Blow:** A direct blow to the radial aspect of the wrist.

### Clinical Features
*   **Pain:** Localized over the radial styloid.
*   **Swelling:** Over the radial aspect of the wrist.
*   **Tenderness:** Point tenderness over the [[radial styloid process]].
*   **ROM:** Painful limitation of wrist movements, especially radial deviation.

### Radiological Features
*   **X-ray Views:** AP, Lateral, and Oblique views.
*   **Appearance:**
    *   A transverse or oblique fracture line separates the radial styloid from the rest of the distal radius.
    *   The fracture line typically extends into the articular surface of the radiocarpal joint.
    *   Usually, there is no significant comminution, but associated ligamentous injury (e.g., [[scapholunate dissociation]]) may be present.

> Draw a distal radius AP view. Show an oblique fracture line cutting off the triangular radial styloid process. The carpus (scaphoid) often appears to have "chiseled" it off.

### Treatment
The goal is to restore the articular surface congruity to prevent secondary [[osteoarthritis]].

**1. Conservative (Non-Operative)**
*   **Indication:** Undisplaced fractures.
*   **Method:** Immobilization in a **Colles' cast** or a below-elbow cast/slab for 4–6 weeks.

**2. Operative Management**
*   **Indication:** Displaced fractures (even minimal displacement disrupts the articular surface).
*   **Methods:**
    *   **Percutaneous Pinning:** [[Closed reduction]] and fixation with **K-wires**.
    *   **ORIF (Open Reduction and Internal Fixation):**
        *   **Lag Screws:** Fixation using 3.0mm or 4.0mm cancellous screws (e.g., [[Herbert screw]] or cannulated screws) is often the treatment of choice for rigid fixation.
        *   **Buttress Plate:** A radial column plate may be used if the fragment is large or comminuted.

## 2. Die-Punch Fracture

### Definition
*   A **depressed fracture** of the articular surface of the [[distal radius]], specifically involving the **lunate fossa**.
*   It is an intra-articular fracture where the dorsal or volar cortex may remain intact, but the articular surface is impacted into the metaphysis.

### Mechanism of Injury
*   **Axial Loading:** Unlike the shearing force of the Chauffeur's fracture, the Die-Punch fracture is caused by a vertical load driving the [[lunate]] bone directly into the distal radius (like a die punch stamping a hole).
*   This typically occurs during a high-energy fall on an outstretched hand.

### Pathoanatomy
*   The [[lunate]] acts as the "hammer" or "punch."
*   The **lunate fossa** of the distal radius acts as the "die."
*   Result: A depressed, impacted fragment of the articular surface, often with a "step-off" (incongruity).

### Radiological Features
*   **X-ray:** May show a depression in the articular surface on the ulnar side of the radius. Subtle depressions can be missed on plain films.
*   **CT Scan:** Often essential to evaluate the degree of articular depression (step-off) and the number of fragments (comminution).

### Management Principles
*   **Principle:** Restoration of **articular congruity** is paramount to prevent post-traumatic arthritis.
*   **Conservative:** Rarely successful for depressed fractures unless completely undisplaced.
*   **Operative:**
    *   **Elevation:** The depressed fragment must be elevated back to the joint line.
    *   **Bone Grafting:** The void left in the metaphysis after elevating the fragment is often filled with [[bone graft]] or a substitute to prevent re-collapse.
    *   **Fixation:** Often requires a buttress plate (volar or dorsal) or K-wires to hold the elevated fragment in place.
    *   **Arthroscopy:** Arthroscopic-assisted reduction is increasingly used to ensure the joint surface is perfectly smooth.

## Comparison Table: Intra-articular Radius Fractures

| Feature | **Chauffeur's Fracture** | **Die-Punch Fracture** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Anatomical Site** | [[Radial Styloid]] | **Lunate Fossa** (Medial aspect of radius) |
| **Mechanism** | Shearing / Avulsion / Radial Deviation | Axial Loading (Vertical compression) |
| **Impacting Bone** | [[Scaphoid]] | [[Lunate]] |
| **Fracture Pattern** | Oblique/Transverse separation | Depression / Impaction |
| **Key Treatment Goal** | Fix styloid to shaft | Elevate depressed surface + Bone Graft |

### Clinical Implications
*   **Arthritis Risk:** Both fractures involve the joint surface. Any residual "step-off" (unevenness) >1-2mm significantly increases the risk of post-traumatic [[osteoarthritis]] and chronic pain.
*   **Associated Injuries:** Always check for associated [[carpal ligament injuries]] (e.g., scapholunate ligament tear with Chauffeur's fracture) as the force transmission often travels through the carpus before breaking the radius.
