# [[Sexual Jurisprudence]] > Examination of Rape Survivor

### Examination of Rape Survivor / Victim

**Rape** is a legal term, not a medical diagnosis. The duty of the medical officer is to examine the survivor/victim for evidence of recent sexual intercourse, physical violence, and to collect samples for forensic analysis. The term **"Survivor"** is preferred over "Victim" to recognize the person's agency and resilience.

### I. Legal and Ethical Prerequisites

Before commencing the examination, specific protocols must be followed strictly to ensure the admissibility of evidence in court.

1.  **Requisition:** A written requisition from a police officer (not below the rank of Sub-Inspector) or a Magistrate is usually required. However, a doctor must examine a victim who comes directly to the hospital without a police requisition (Supreme Court mandate) and then inform the police.
2.  **Consent:**
    *   **Informed Written Consent** is mandatory from the victim.
    *   If the victim is **< 12 years** or of **unsound mind**, consent from the guardian/parent is required.
    *   Under **[[Section 164A CrPC]]**, the victim cannot be examined without consent.
    *   The victim has the right to refuse any part of the examination.
3.  **Presence of Female Attendant:**
    *   Examination must be conducted by or under the supervision of a female Registered Medical Practitioner ([[RMP]]).
    *   If a male doctor examines, a female attendant/nurse must be present throughout (Third Party presence).
4.  **Privacy:** Examination must be conducted in a private room with dignity.
5.  **Free Treatment:** As per **[[Section 357C CrPC]]**, all hospitals (public/private) must provide immediate first-aid and medical treatment free of cost.

### II. Preliminary Data and History

Detailed documentation is vital. Use a standardized proforma (SAFE Kit - Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence).

**1. Identification:**
*   Name, Age, Sex, Address.
*   Brought by whom (Name and buckle number of PC).
*   **Two identification marks.**
*   Signature/Thumb impression of the survivor.
*   Date and **exact time** of examination (Crucial as evidence degrades with time).

**2. History of Incident (Alleged History):**
*   Record in the **survivor's own words** (Verbatim).
*   Date, time, and place of the alleged assault.
*   Number of assailants and their identity (if known).
*   Nature of acts: Penetration (vaginal, anal, oral), use of condom, ejaculation (inside/outside/on body).
*   Loss of consciousness or use of intoxicants.

**3. History of Events *After* the Incident:**
This determines the loss of trace evidence. Ask if she has:
*   Washed/bathed/douched.
*   Changed clothes.
*   Defecated/urinated.
*   Brushed teeth/rinsed mouth.

**4. Menstrual and Obstetric History:**
*   LMP (Last Menstrual Period).
*   Menarche, Gravida, Parity.
*   Use of contraceptives (OCP/IUCD).

**5. Past Sexual History:**
*   *Note:* **Section 53A of the Indian Evidence Act** states that previous sexual experience is irrelevant to the issue of consent.
*   History is taken *only* to interpret medical findings (e.g., separating DNA of a consensual partner from the assailant if intercourse occurred recently, e.g., within 24-48 hours).

### III. General Physical Examination

1.  **Emotional State:** Calm, crying, hysterical, withdrawn, or shocked.
2.  **Clothing:**
    *   Examine for tears, missing buttons, mud, grass stains.
    *   Look for stains of blood or semen (stiff, starch-like feel; fluoresces under UV light/Wood's Lamp).
3.  **General Injuries:**
    *   Examine the whole body for bruises, abrasions, bites, or scratches.
    *   **Extragenital Injuries:** Look for [[defense wounds]] on hands/forearms.
    *   Check specific sites: Breasts, face, lips, neck (throttling marks), inner aspect of thighs, buttocks, and back (imprint abrasions from ground).
    *   Use a body map to document injuries.

### IV. Local Genital Examination

**Position:** Lithotomy position. Good lighting is essential.

**1. External Genitalia:**
*   **Pubic Hair:** Check for matting (semen/blood). Comb for loose foreign hairs (assailant's hair).
*   **Vulva/Labia:** Look for swelling, redness, tenderness, abrasions, or lacerations.
*   **Thighs:** Look for seminal stains or bruising on the inner aspect.

**2. Hymen:**
*   Inspect for intactness or rupture.
*   If torn: Note the position (clock-face reference), margins (fresh/bleeding/healing/healed), edema, or tenderness.
*   *Note:* In multiparous women or those habituated to intercourse, hymenal tears may be old (carunculae myrtiformes).

**3. Internal Examination:**
*   **Vagina:** Look for rugosities, warmth, moisture, injuries, or foreign bodies.
*   **Posterior Fourchette/Fossa Navicularis:** Common sites for tears in forced intercourse.
*   **Cervix:** Speculum examination to check for injury or discharge.

> **IMPORTANT:** The **"Two-Finger Test"** (digital examination to assess laxity of vagina/habituation) is **BANNED** and unscientific. It violates the survivor's dignity and has no bearing on sexual violence.

### V. Collection of Forensic Evidence (The "Rape Kit")

All samples must be collected, labeled, sealed, and handed over to the police under a strict **[[Chain of Custody]]**.

| Specimen | Purpose/Finding | Preservation/Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Clothing** | Semen, blood, DNA | Air-dry, pack in **paper bags** (never plastic to prevent fungus). |
| **Loose Hairs** | Assailant's DNA | Combing of pubic area over a clean paper sheet. |
| **Pubic Hair (Victim)** | Comparison | Pluck (do not cut) 10-20 hairs with roots. |
| **Vaginal Swabs** | Semen/Sperm detection | 3 swabs (low vaginal, high vaginal/fornix). Air dry. |
| **Vaginal Smear** | Sperm morphology | Prepared on glass slide, fixed. |
| **Nail Scrapings** | Assailant's tissue/blood (defense) | Scrape with toothpick/stick, collect in paper fold. |
| **Blood** | Grouping, Alcohol/Drug, DNA | EDTA vial (DNA) + Fluoride vial (Alcohol/Drugs). |
| **Urine** | Pregnancy, Drugs | Sterile container (Preservative: Sodium Fluoride). |
| **Oral Swab** | Oral intercourse evidence | If history suggests oral sex. |
| **Anal Swab** | Anal intercourse evidence | If history suggests sodomy. |
| **Matted Hair** | Semen/Saliva | Cut the matted portion. |

**Mnemonic for Evidence Collection:** **"SHE SELLS SEA SHELLS"**
*   **S** - Swabs (Vaginal, Anal, Oral)
*   **H** - Hair (Pubic combings + Control)
*   **E** - Envelopes (Paper bags for clothes)
*   **S** - Slides (Smears)
*   **E** - EDTA blood (DNA)
*   **L** - Labeling (Strict chain of custody)
*   **L** - Local Injuries (Document)
*   **S** - Scrapings (Nail)

### VI. Laboratory Investigations

1.  **Detection of Semen:**
    *   *Physical:* UV light (Blue fluorescence).
    *   *Chemical:* **[[Acid Phosphatase]]** test (highly specific for prostatic fluid).
    *   *Microscopy:* Detection of Spermatozoa (Christmas tree stain).
    *   *Serological:* P30 / PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen).
    *   **[[DNA Profiling]]**: Gold standard for identification.
2.  **Detection of Saliva:** Amylase test (for bite marks).
3.  **Toxicology:** For date-rape drugs ([[Rohypnol]], [[GHB]], Ketamine).

### VII. Medicolegal Opinion / Report

The doctor must give a provisional opinion based on clinical findings.
*   **Do NOT write:** "Rape has been committed." (This is a judicial verdict).
*   **Do write:**
    *   "No evidence of recent sexual intercourse."
    *   "Findings are consistent with recent sexual intercourse."
    *   "Evidence of physical struggle/injuries present."
    *   "Opinion reserved pending Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) report."

**Negative findings do not rule out rape** (e.g., lack of genital injury is common in drug-facilitated sexual assault or where the victim did not resist due to fear).

---

### VIII. Treatment and Management

1.  **Care of Injuries:** Treat lacerations, bleeding, and fractures immediately.
2.  **STD Prophylaxis:**
    *   Antibiotics for Gonorrhea/Chlamydia/Syphilis (e.g., Ceftriaxone, Azithromycin, Doxycycline).
    *   Hepatitis B vaccination/Immunoglobulin.
    *   **HIV Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP):** Start within **72 hours** (ideally < 2 hours). Regimen: Tenofovir + Lamivudine + Dolutegravir (or as per NACO guidelines).
3.  **Pregnancy Prevention:** Emergency Contraception (**Levonorgestrel** 1.5 mg) within **72 hours**.
4.  **Psychological Support:** Counseling for [[Rape Trauma Syndrome]] and PTSD. Referral to a crisis center or psychiatrist.
