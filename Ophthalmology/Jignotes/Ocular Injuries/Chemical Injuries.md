# [[Ocular Injuries]] > Chemical Injuries

### Chemical Injuries of the Eye

[[Chemical Injuries]] of the eye are true ocular emergencies requiring immediate intervention. They can range from mild irritation to complete destruction of the ocular surface and blindness. The severity depends on the **nature**, **concentration**, **pH**, and **duration of contact** of the chemical.

#### Pathophysiology: Alkali vs. Acid Burns

The fundamental difference lies in the mechanism of tissue damage and depth of penetration. **[[Alkali Burns]] are generally more severe than [[Acid Burns]].**,

| Feature | Alkali Burns | Acid Burns |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Common Agents** | **[[Ammonia]]** (Fertilizers, refrigerants)<br>**[[Lye]]** (Drain cleaners)<br>**[[Lime]]** (Plaster, cement, whitewash)<br>**[[Magnesium Hydroxide]]** (Sparklers) | **[[Sulfuric Acid]]** (Car batteries)<br>**[[Hydrochloric Acid]]**<br>**[[Nitric Acid]]**<br>**[[Acetic Acid]]** |
| **Mechanism of Action** | **[[Liquefactive Necrosis]]**<br>1. **Saponification** of fatty acids in cell membranes.<br>2. Destruction of proteoglycan ground substance. | **[[Coagulative Necrosis]]**<br>1. Precipitaton/coagulation of proteins upon contact. |
| **Penetration** | **Deep and Rapid**.<br>Hydroxyl ions ($OH^-$) penetrate the stroma and enter the anterior chamber rapidly. | **Limited/Self-limiting**.<br>The coagulated proteins form a barrier (**eschar**) that prevents deeper penetration of the acid. |
| **Key Characteristic** | **Saponification** leads to softening and gelatinization of tissues. | **Precipitation** leads to sharply demarcated lesions. |
| **Severity** | **More Severe**. Can destroy the [[Trabecular Meshwork]], lens, and ciliary body. | Generally **Less Severe** (except Hydrofluoric acid which behaves like an alkali). |

**Note on Ammonia:** [[Liquid Ammonia]] is the most harmful alkali because it penetrates the fastest.
**Note on Lime:** [[Lime]] burns are common (Chuna particles). Lime enters as particulate matter and gets trapped in the fornices, causing prolonged release of alkali.

#### Clinical Classification and Grading

The prognosis depends heavily on the extent of **[[Limbal Ischemia]]** (damage to [[Limbal Stem Cells]]).

**1. Roper-Hall Classification** (Based on Corneal Haze and Limbal Ischemia)

| Grade | Prognosis | Corneal Appearance | Limbal Ischemia |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I** | Good | Clear cornea; epithelial damage only | Nil |
| **II** | Good | Hazy cornea; iris details visible | < 1/3 limbal circumference |
| **III** | Guarded | Total epithelial loss; stromal haze (iris details obscured) | 1/3 to 1/2 limbal circumference |
| **IV** | Poor | Opaque cornea (no iris/pupil view) | > 1/2 limbal circumference |

**2. Dua's Classification**
*   More detailed; considers **conjunctival involvement** (clock hours) alongside limbal ischemia.
*   Grades I to VI (Grade VI being the worst with >50% conjunctival involvement and total limbal ischemia).

#### Clinical Features

**Symptoms:**
*   Severe pain (due to epithelial loss and nerve exposure).
*   Photophobia and blepharospasm.
*   Profuse lacrimation.
*   Blurred vision.

**Signs:**
*   **Acute Phase:**
    *   **Conjunctiva:** Chemosis, hyperemia, or **ischemia** (white, porcelain-like appearance indicates severe burn due to vascular closure).
    *   **Cornea:** Epithelial defects, stromal edema, cloudiness. In severe alkali burns, the cornea may look like a "boiled fish eye".
    *   **Anterior Chamber:** Iritis, flare, and cells. Increased [[Intraocular Pressure]] (IOP) due to collagen shrinkage of the trabecular meshwork.
*   **Late Phase (Sequelae):**
    *   [[Symblepharon]] (adhesion between palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva).
    *   [[Ankyloblepharon]].
    *   [[Corneal Opacity]] / Vascularization.
    *   [[Secondary Glaucoma]].
    *   Dry Eye (loss of goblet cells).

#### Management

**A. Emergency Treatment (Immediate)**
*   **Copious Irrigation:** This is the *single most important step*.
    *   Use **[[Balanced Salt Solution]]**, **[[Ringer Lactate]]**, or Normal Saline. If unavailable, use tap water,.
    *   Irrigate for **20-30 minutes** or until the pH of the cul-de-sac is neutral (7.0 - 7.4).
    *   **Double Eversion:** Evert the upper lid to remove trapped particulate matter (especially lime/cement).
    *   *Do not wait for history taking or vision testing before irrigation.*

**B. Medical Management (Acute Phase)**
The goal is to promote epithelial healing, reduce inflammation, and prevent collagen melting.

1.  **Topical Antibiotics:** Broad-spectrum (e.g., [[Moxifloxacin]], [[Chloramphenicol]]) to prevent secondary infection.
2.  **Cycloplegics:** [[Atropine]] 1% to relieve ciliary spasm (pain) and prevent posterior synechiae,.
3.  **Topical Steroids:** (e.g., [[Dexamethasone]] or [[Prednisolone]])
    *   Use cautiously in the first 7–10 days to reduce inflammation (neutrophil infiltration) and iritis.
    *   **Clinical Implication:** Steroids must be tapered or stopped after **2 weeks** because they inhibit collagen synthesis and enhance collagenase activity, increasing the risk of **[[Corneal Melting]]** (Keratolysis).
4.  **Collagen Synthesis Promoters & Collagenase Inhibitors:**
    *   **Systemic/Topical [[Ascorbate]] (Vitamin C):** Promotes collagen synthesis by corneal fibroblasts. Helps prevent corneal thinning.
    *   **Topical [[Sodium Citrate]] 10%:** Chelates calcium, inhibiting neutrophil collagenase activity,.
    *   **Systemic [[Tetracyclines]] (Doxycycline):** Inhibits matrix metalloproteinases (collagenases).
5.  **Lubricants:** Preservative-free artificial tears.
6.  **IOP Control:** Oral [[Acetazolamide]] or topical [[Timolol]] if secondary glaucoma develops.

**C. Surgical Management**
*   **Early:**
    *   **[[Amniotic Membrane Transplantation]] (AMT):** Promotes epithelialization and reduces inflammation.
    *   **Tenonoplasty:** For severe ischemia to restore vascularity.
*   **Late (Rehabilitation):**
    *   **Lysis of Symblepharon.**
    *   **[[Limbal Stem Cell Transplantation]] (LSCT):** For stem cell deficiency (conjunctivalization of cornea).
    *   **[[Keratoplasty]]:** Only after surface stability is achieved. Prognosis is often poor in chemical burns due to vascularization and rejection.
    *   **[[Keratoprosthesis]] (e.g., Boston KPro):** For end-stage severe burns where graft failure is likely.
