# Diagnosis and Prevention of Swine Flu (Pandemic Influenza A H1N1)

**Swine flu** is an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by the [[Influenza A (H1N1) pdm09]] virus. Unlike seasonal flu, the 2009 pandemic strain showed the capability to infect the lower respiratory tract rapidly, causing severe pneumonia, even in young and healthy adults.

**Incubation Period:** 1–4 days (can range up to 7 days).

### **I. Diagnosis**

Diagnosis relies on clinical categorization and laboratory confirmation.

#### **1. Case Definitions**
*   **Suspect Case:** Acute febrile respiratory illness (fever $>38^{\circ}\text{C}$) **PLUS** history of travel to an affected area or contact with a confirmed case within 7 days.
*   **Probable Case:** A person with acute febrile respiratory illness who is positive for Influenza A but unsubtypable for seasonal H1/H3, **OR** positive by rapid test in a defined outbreak.
*   **Confirmed Case:** A person with acute febrile respiratory illness with laboratory confirmation by one of the following methods:
    *   Real-Time PCR (**RT-PCR**) – *Gold Standard*
    *   Viral Culture
    *   Four-fold rise in specific neutralizing antibodies.

#### **2. Laboratory Diagnosis**
*   **Specimen Collection:**
    *   **Upper Respiratory Tract:** Nasopharyngeal swab and throat swab.
    *   **Lower Respiratory Tract:** Bronchial aspirates (higher yield in patients with severe pneumonia).
*   **Preferred Test:** **Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction ([[RT-PCR]])** is the most timely and sensitive method for detection.
*   **Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs):** These detect antigens but have **low sensitivity**. A negative result **does not** rule out the disease and should not stop treatment or infection control measures.

#### **3. Clinical Categorization (Government of India Guidelines)**
For management and testing purposes, cases are divided into three categories:

| Category | Clinical Presentation | Management Action | Testing Required? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Category A** | Mild fever + Cough/Sore throat. No breathlessness. | • Home Isolation<br>• Symptomatic treatment<br>• No Oseltamivir needed | **NO** |
| **Category B** | **B1:** High-grade fever ($>102^{\circ}\text{F}$) + Severe sore throat.<br>**B2:** High-risk group* with mild illness. | • Home Isolation<br>• **Start [[Oseltamivir]] immediately** | **NO** |
| **Category C** | **Danger Signs:** Breathlessness, chest pain, hypotension, hemoptysis, cyanosis (blue nails), drowsiness, or worsening of underlying conditions. | • **Hospitalization** (Isolation ward/ICU)<br>• **Start Oseltamivir** immediately | **YES** |

***High-risk groups (Category B2):** Children $<5$ years, Pregnant women, Age $>65$ years, comorbidities (Lung/Heart/Liver/Kidney disease, Diabetes, HIV, etc.).*

### **II. Prevention**

Prevention strategies focus on breaking the chain of transmission through general measures, chemoprophylaxis, and vaccination.

#### **1. General Measures (Non-Pharmaceutical)**
*   **Respiratory Hygiene:** Cover mouth/nose with a tissue or handkerchief when coughing or sneezing.
*   **Hand Hygiene:** Frequent hand washing with soap and water or alcohol-based sanitizers.
*   **Isolation:**
    *   Patients should be isolated for **7 days** after the onset of illness OR **24 hours** after the resolution of fever/respiratory symptoms, whichever is longer.
*   **PPE:** Healthcare workers performing aerosol-generating procedures must use **N95 respirators**.

#### **2. Chemoprophylaxis**
*   **Drug of Choice:** [[Oseltamivir]] (Tamiflu).
*   **Indication:** Close contacts of suspected/confirmed cases and healthcare personnel at high risk.
*   **Duration:** Should be given till **10 days** after the last exposure.
*   **Prophylactic Dosage**:
    *   Adults/Weight $>40$ kg: 75 mg Once Daily (OD).
    *   Infants ($<3$ months): Not recommended unless critical.

#### **3. Vaccination**
Vaccination is the most effective long-term preventive measure.

*   **Vaccine Strain:** Based on **A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v like strain**.
*   **Priority Groups:**
    1.  **Pregnant Women** (Highest priority).
    2.  Healthcare workers.
    3.  Individuals with chronic medical conditions (6 months – 65 years).
    4.  Healthy young adults and children.

**Types of H1N1 Vaccines:**

| Feature | **Inactivated Vaccine** | **Live Attenuated Vaccine (LAIV)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type** | Killed virus | Live attenuated virus |
| **Route** | Intramuscular (Deltoid) | Intranasal Spray |
| **Dosage** | 0.5 ml (Single dose for adults) | 0.5 ml (Spray) |
| **Contraindications** | History of anaphylaxis to **egg protein** or vaccine components; GBS within 6 weeks. | Immunocompromised, Pregnant women. |
| **Protection** | Immunity develops after **14 days**. | Sheds virus in secretions for up to 3 weeks. |

### **Clinical Relevance & Mnemonics**

**Mnemonic for High-Risk Groups (Category B2)**
**"P-OLD-C"**
*   **P** - Pregnant women (Most important!)
*   **O** - Obesity (Morbid)
*   **L** - Lung/Liver diseases (Chronic)
*   **D** - Diabetes / Drug-induced immunosuppression
*   **C** - Children ($<5$) and Cardiac disease

**Clinical Note:**
Do not wait for lab results to start treatment in severe (Category C) or high-risk (Category B) patients. **Early initiation of Oseltamivir** is associated with better outcomes. **Aspirin** should be avoided in children with flu symptoms to prevent **Reye's Syndrome**.
