# [[Food Poisoning]] > Mushroom Poisoning

### **Mushroom Poisoning (Mycetismus)**

Mushrooms are fungi, some of which are edible while others are highly poisonous. Poisonous mushrooms usually have a bitter, astringent, or acid taste and may change color (brown/green/blue) on cutting, though there are no distinct morphological rules to distinguish edible from poisonous varieties.

### **Classification of Poisonous Mushrooms**

Based on the onset of symptoms and the active principle involved:

| Type | Onset | Active Principle | Example | Main Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cytotoxic** (Hepatotoxic) | Delayed (6–24 hrs) | [[Amanitin]], [[Phalloidin]] | *[[Amanita phalloides]]* (Death Cap) | Liver and Kidney failure |
| **Neurotoxic** (Cholinergic) | Rapid (15 min–2 hrs) | [[Muscarine]] | *[[Amanita muscaria]]* (Fly Agaric) | Parasympathetic stimulation |
| **Gastrointestinal Irritant** | Rapid (30 min–3 hrs) | Resins/Volatile oils | *Russula*, *Lactarius* | Vomiting, Diarrhea |
| **Hallucinogenic** | Rapid | [[Psilocybin]] | *Psilocybe* species (Magic Mushrooms) | LSD-like hallucinations |

### **1. Amanita Phalloides (Deadly Agaric / Death Cap)**
This is the most dangerous variety, responsible for >90% of mushroom fatalities.

**Active Principles (Cyclopeptides)**
1.  **Phallotoxins (Phalloidin):** Acts rapidly but is not well absorbed from the GIT. Heat stable.
2.  **Amatoxins ([[Alpha-amanitin]]):** Highly toxic, slowly absorbed, heat stable (cooking does not destroy toxin).
3.  **Mechanism:** They inhibit the enzyme **RNA polymerase II**, thereby stopping cellular protein synthesis, leading to cell death (especially in the liver and kidneys).

**Clinical Stages (Phalloides Syndrome)**
The clinical course typically presents in **four stages**:

1.  **Latent Period (Asymptomatic):** Lasts for **6 to 24 hours** after ingestion. This delay is a diagnostic feature.
2.  **Gastrointestinal Phase:** Sudden onset of colicky abdominal pain, projectile vomiting, and profuse bloody diarrhea (cholera-like). Can lead to severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.
3.  **Phase of Apparent Recovery (Second Latent Phase):** The patient feels subjectively better for a day or two, but liver damage continues silently.
4.  **Hepatorenal Phase (Terminal Phase):**
    *   **Liver:** Tender hepatomegaly, jaundice, increased transaminases, fulminant hepatic failure, hepatic encephalopathy.
    *   **Kidney:** Oliguria, anuria, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), uremia.
    *   **CNS:** Convulsions, coma, and death.

**Fatal Dose:** **2 to 3 mushrooms** (approx. 50g) are sufficient to kill an adult.
**Fatal Period:** 24 hours to 7-10 days.

### **2. Amanita Muscaria (Fly Agaric)**
This mushroom usually has a red or yellow pileus (cap) with white warty scales.

**Active Principle:**
*   **[[Muscarine]]:** Stimulates post-ganglionic parasympathetic fibers (Cholinergic action).
*   Also contains Ibotenic acid (causes delirium).

**Clinical Features:**
*   **Onset:** Rapid (within 1-2 hours).
*   **Muscarinic Effects (SLUDGE):** **S**alivation, **L**acrimation, **U**rination, **D**efecation, **G**astrointestinal cramps, **E**mesis.
*   **Neurotic/CNS Effects:** Giddiness, confusion, [[delirium]] (resembling alcohol intoxication), hallucinations, constricted pupils ([[miosis]]), convulsions.
*   **Mnemonic:** "Muscaria makes you **Moist** (Secretions) and **Mad** (Delirium)."

### **Diagnosis**
1.  **History:** Consumption of wild mushrooms.
2.  **Clinical Toxidromes:** Delayed onset suggests hepatotoxic type; rapid onset suggests neurotoxic type.
3.  **Spores identification:** In vomit or stool. *Amanita* spores are hyaline, thin-walled, and apple-seed shaped.
4.  **[[Meixner test]] (Wieland test):**
    *   *Procedure:* Rub mushroom juice/gastric aspirate on a newspaper (which contains lignin). Add concentrated Hydrochloric acid (HCl).
    *   *Result:* A **Blue** color indicates the presence of **Amatoxins**.

### **Treatment**

**General Measures:**
1.  **Stomach Wash:** With warm water or **Potassium Permanganate (1:5000)**. Useful even in delayed cases to remove spores.
2.  **[[Activated Charcoal]]:** Repeated doses to interrupt enterohepatic circulation.
3.  **Fluid Resuscitation:** Aggressive correction of dehydration and electrolytes.

**Specific Management:**
*   **For *Amanita muscaria*:**
    *   **Antidote:** **[[Atropine]]** (1–2 mg IV) to counteract muscarinic effects (excessive secretions, bradycardia).
*   **For *Amanita phalloides*:**
    *   **[[Penicillin G]]:** High dose (300,000 to 1,000,000 units/kg/day) helps prevent uptake of amatoxin by hepatocytes.
    *   **[[Silibinin]] (Milk Thistle extract):** Hepatoprotective; inhibits toxin entry into liver cells.
    *   **Thioctic acid:** Used historically, efficacy debated.
    *   **Hemodialysis/Hemoperfusion:** To remove circulating toxins (effective only in very early stages).
    *   **Liver Transplantation:** The only definitive treatment for fulminant hepatic failure.

### **Postmortem Findings**
*   **External:** Jaundice, cyanosis, subcutaneous hemorrhages.
*   **Internal:**
    *   **GIT:** Inflammation of mucous membrane (gastritis/enteritis). Fragments of mushroom (gills/spores) may be found in the stomach.
    *   **Liver:** Fatty degeneration, **centrilobular necrosis**, acute yellow atrophy.
    *   **Kidneys:** Fatty degeneration, tubular necrosis.
    *   **Heart:** Subendocardial hemorrhages, fatty changes.
    *   **Brain:** Cerebral edema, congestion.

### **Medicolegal Aspects**
*   **Accidental:** Most common. Occurs due to misidentification of poisonous mushrooms as edible ones by foragers.
*   **Suicide:** Rare, as the death is painful and prolonged.
*   **Homicide:** Very rare, but possible (e.g., mixing with food to mask the taste).
*   **Mass Poisoning:** Can occur when a family consumes a meal made from collected wild mushrooms.
