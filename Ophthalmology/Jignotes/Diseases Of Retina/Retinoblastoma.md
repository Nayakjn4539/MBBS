# [[Retinoblastoma]]

[[Retinoblastoma]] is the most common primary malignant **intraocular tumor** of childhood. It arises from the primitive multipotent neuroectodermal cells (neuroblasts) of the retina.

*   **Incidence:** 1 in 15,000–20,000 live births.
*   **Age of Onset:** usually < 3 years (Average 18 months). Rare after 5 years.
*   **Nature:** It is a malignant tumor of the [[sensory retina]].

### 1. Genetics and Inheritance

The fundamental etiology involves the **RB1 gene** (a tumor suppressor gene).

*   **Chromosomal Location:** Long arm of **Chromosome 13** ([[13q14]]).
*   **Gene Function:** The [[RB1 gene]] codes for a nuclear phosphoprotein (pRB) that regulates the cell cycle at the G1-to-S phase transition. Loss of this function leads to uncontrolled cell division.
*   **Knudson’s Two-Hit Hypothesis:** For a tumor to develop, **both alleles** of the RB1 gene must be inactivated (mutated or deleted).

#### Types based on Inheritance

| Feature | Heritable (Germline) Cases | Non-Heritable (Somatic) Cases |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frequency** | ~40% of cases | ~60% of cases |
| **First "Hit" (Mutation)** | Occurs in **germ cells** (sperm/ovum) before fertilization. Present in all body cells. | Occurs in a single **somatic retinal cell** after fertilization. |
| **Second "Hit"** | Occurs in a retinal cell during development. | Occurs in the *same* retinal cell that had the first hit. |
| **Laterality** | Usually **Bilateral** (can be unilateral). | Always **Unilateral**. |
| **Number of Tumors** | **Multifocal**. | **Unifocal**. |
| **Transmissibility** | Transmissible to offspring (Autosomal Dominant). | Not transmissible. |
| **Risk of Second Malignancy** | **High** (e.g., [[Osteosarcoma]]). | Low (same as general population). |

**Clinical Implication:**
Patients with heritable [[retinoblastoma]] are at high risk for **second non-ocular malignancies**. The most common is **[[Osteosarcoma]]** (bone tumor), followed by soft tissue sarcomas and melanomas.

**Trilateral Retinoblastoma:**
Defined as **Bilateral Retinoblastoma** + an intracranial midline neuroblastic tumor (usually **[[Pinealoblastoma]]** or tumor in the suprasellar region). It has a very poor prognosis.

### 2. Pathology

**Gross Appearance:**
*   Chalky white, friable mass.
*   Areas of **calcification** and necrosis are characteristic.

**Microscopic Features:**
The tumor consists of small, round, blue cells with large hyperchromatic nuclei.

*   **[[Flexner-Wintersteiner Rosettes]]:** Pathognomonic (Specific). Cells arranged around a clear central lumen. The nuclei are peripheral.
*   **[[Homer-Wright Rosettes]]:** Non-specific (also seen in [[neuroblastoma]]). Cells arranged around a central tangle of neural fibrils (no lumen).
*   **[[Fleurettes]]:** Flower-like arrangement of cells representing differentiation into photoreceptor elements (seen in well-differentiated tumors).

### 3. Clinical Features and Stages of Progression

The disease typically progresses through four clinical stages if untreated:

#### I. Quiescent Stage
*   **[[Leukocoria]] (Amaurotic Cat’s Eye Reflex):** The most common presentation (60%). A yellowish-white reflex seen in the pupil.
*   **[[Strabismus]] (Squint):** The second most common presentation (20%). Usually esotropia due to loss of central vision.
*   **Nystagmus:** If bilateral loss of central vision occurs.

#### II. Glaucomatous Stage
*   The tumor grows, causing increased [[intraocular pressure]].
*   Pain, redness, and corneal haze.
*   **Buphthalmos:** Enlargement of the eyeball (if IOP rises before age 3).

#### III. Stage of Extraocular Extension
*   **Direct spread:** Through the **[[optic nerve]]** to the brain (most common route of death).
*   **Scleral breakthrough:** Fungating mass through the limbus or sclera, leading to [[proptosis]].

#### IV. Stage of Metastasis
*   **Lymphatic spread:** To preauricular and cervical lymph nodes.
*   **Hematogenous spread:** To bones (skull/long bones) and liver.

**Growth Patterns:**
*   **Endophytic:** Grows inward into the [[vitreous cavity]]. Clinically sees a white mass; vitreous seeding is common.
*   **Exophytic:** Grows outward towards the [[choroid]], causing exudative [[retinal detachment]].
*   **Diffuse Infiltrating:** Rare, causes placoid thickening of the retina; mimics [[uveitis]]; usually no calcification.

### 4. Classification (Staging)

The **International Classification of Retinoblastoma (ICRB)** is currently used to predict the success of globe-salvaging treatments (Chemoreduction).

| Group | Description | Prognosis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Group A** | Small tumors (**≤ 3 mm**) located away from [[foveola]] (>3 mm) and [[optic disc]] (>1.5 mm). | Very Low Risk |
| **Group B** | Larger tumors (**> 3 mm**) OR macular/juxtapapillary location OR small subretinal fluid. | Low Risk |
| **Group C** | Tumor with **focal** seeds (subretinal or vitreous) within 3 mm of the tumor. | Moderate Risk |
| **Group D** | Tumor with **diffuse** seeds (subretinal or vitreous) > 3 mm from the tumor. | High Risk |
| **Group E** | Extensive disease: Tumor touching lens, [[neovascular glaucoma]], aseptic orbital cellulitis, anterior chamber involvement, or [[phthisis bulbi]]. | Very High Risk |

### 5. Diagnosis

*   **Examination under Anesthesia (EUA):** Detailed fundus exam with indentation to check periphery. Measure corneal diameter and IOP.
*   **[[B-scan Ultrasonography]] (USG):**
    *   Detects the mass.
    *   **High internal reflectivity** (Calcification).
    *   **Acoustic shadowing** behind the mass.
*   **[[CT Scan]]:**
    *   Detects **intraocular calcification** (seen in 75% cases).
    *   *Note:* Avoided if possible due to radiation risk in germline cases.
*   **[[MRI]]:**
    *   **Gold Standard** to evaluate **Optic Nerve invasion** and [[trilateral retinoblastoma]].
    *   Calcification is hypointense (dark) on MRI.
*   **Biopsy:** **CONTRAINDICATED** due to risk of extraocular spread. Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB) is *only* considered in difficult diagnostic cases where the eye is already lost or atypical presentation.

**Differential Diagnosis (Pseudoglioma):**
Any condition mimicking [[retinoblastoma]] (Leukocoria):
1.  **[[Retinopathy of Prematurity]] (ROP)**
2.  **[[Persistent Hyperplastic Primary Vitreous]] (PHPV)**
3.  **[[Coats Disease]]** (Exudative retinopathy)
4.  **[[Ocular Toxocariasis]]**
5.  **Congenital [[Cataract]]**

### 6. Treatment

**Management Goals (Priority Order):**
1.  Save Life.
2.  Save the Eye (Globe salvage).
3.  Save Vision.

#### A. Focal Therapy (For small tumors - Group A)
*   **[[Laser Photocoagulation]]:** For tumors posterior to the equator.
*   **[[Cryotherapy]]:** For anterior tumors. Triple freeze-thaw technique.
*   **Transpupillary Thermotherapy (TTT):** Using Diode laser (810 nm) + Chemotherapy.

#### B. Chemotherapy (Chemoreduction)
Used to shrink tumors (Group B, C, D) to make them amenable to focal therapy.
*   **Systemic Chemotherapy (Standard VEC regimen):**
    *   **V** - [[Vincristine]]
    *   **E** - [[Etoposide]]
    *   **C** - [[Carboplatin]]
*   **Intra-arterial Chemotherapy (IAC):** Injection of [[Melphalan]] directly into the ophthalmic artery. Highly effective for globe salvage.
*   **Intravitreal Chemotherapy:** For vitreous seeds (Melphalan/Topotecan).

#### C. Radiotherapy
*   **[[Brachytherapy]] (Plaque Radiotherapy):** Uses **Ruthenium-106** or **Iodine-125** plaques sutured to the sclera. Used for localized tumors or recurrence.
*   **External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT):** Rarely used now due to side effects (facial deformity and risk of secondary malignancies like sarcoma).

#### D. Surgical Therapy
*   **[[Enucleation]]:** Removal of the entire globe with a long stump of the [[optic nerve]] (10-15 mm).
    *   *Indications:* **Group E** retinoblastoma, optic nerve invasion, anterior chamber involvement, neovascular glaucoma, or massive tumor filling >50% of the globe.
*   **[[Exenteration]]:** Removal of all orbital contents. Indicated for massive **extraocular extension** involving the orbit.
