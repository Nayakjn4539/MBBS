# [[Communicable Diseases - Intestinal Infections]] > Ascariasis

### [[Ascariasis]] (Roundworm Infection)

**Ascariasis** is an infection of the intestinal tract caused by the adult nematode *Ascaris lumbricoides*. It is the most common helminthic infection worldwide and is a major cause of [[Malnutrition]] in children.

### Epidemiological Determinants

**1. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** *Ascaris lumbricoides* (Roundworm). It is the largest intestinal nematode.
*   **Habitat:** Lumen of the [[Small Intestine]] (jejunum).
*   **Morphology:**
    *   **Female:** 20–35 cm long; produces ~200,000 to 240,000 eggs/day.
    *   **Male:** 12–30 cm long.
*   **Eggs:**
    *   Passed in feces.
    *   **Resistance:** Eggs are highly resistant; can survive in soil for months to years.
    *   **Infective Form:** **Embryonated eggs** (Eggs require 2–3 weeks in the soil to become infective).

**2. Host Factors**
*   **Natural Host/Reservoir:** **Man** is the only reservoir.
*   **Age:** High infection rates in children (3–8 years) due to habits of playing in mud/soil.
*   **Host-Parasite Relation:** High degree of tolerance; worms "rob" the host of nutrition, leading to [[Growth Retardation]] and Vitamin A deficiency.

**3. Environmental Factors**
*   **Soil:** Clay soil is most favorable for egg development.
*   **Habits:** **Open defecation** (seeding the soil) and lack of hygiene are the most important factors for spread.
*   **Climate:** Prevalence is high in warm, moist, tropical/subtropical climates.

### Transmission
*   **Route:** **Fecal-oral route**.
*   **Mode:** Ingestion of **infective eggs** via:
    *   Contaminated food (raw vegetables/salads) or water.
    *   Dirty fingers/hands (geophagia/pica in children).
    *   Dust (inhalation and swallowing of airborne eggs).
*   **Risk of Human-to-Human Transmission:** **No direct person-to-person transmission** occurs because fresh feces contain non-infective eggs. The eggs *must* undergo development (embryonation) in the soil for about 3 weeks to become infective.

### Life Cycle > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Life Cycle of Ascaris
The cycle is completed in **one host (Man)**.
1.  **Ingestion:** Man swallows infective (embryonated) eggs.
2.  **Hatching:** Larvae hatch in the small intestine and penetrate the gut wall.
3.  **Migration (Lung Phase):** Larvae enter portal circulation $\rightarrow$ Liver $\rightarrow$ Heart $\rightarrow$ **Lungs**.
4.  **Moulting:** Larvae grow and moult twice in the lungs.
5.  **Re-entry:** Larvae break into alveoli $\rightarrow$ ascend trachea $\rightarrow$ coughed up and **swallowed**.
6.  **Maturation:** Reach small intestine, mature into adults, and females start laying eggs (60–80 days after infection).

---

### Incubation Period
*   **Biological IP (Pre-patent period):** 2–3 months (Time from ingestion of egg to passage of eggs in stool).
*   **Clinical IP:** Variable; lung symptoms may occur 18 days after infection.

---

### Clinical Picture
Clinical manifestations depend on the worm burden and stage.

**1. Larval Migration Stage (Lungs)**
*   **Loeffler’s Syndrome:** Fever, cough, sputum, asthma-like symptoms, and **eosinophilia** due to hypersensitivity to larvae in lungs.
*   X-ray may show transitory infiltrates.

**2. Adult Worm Stage (Intestine)**
*   **Light infection:** Often asymptomatic.
*   **Heavy infection:**
    *   **Nutritional:** Anorexia, weakness, weight loss, [[Vitamin A Deficiency]], protein-energy malnutrition.
    *   **Mechanical:** Vague abdominal pain, nausea.
    *   **Allergic:** Urticaria, skin rash.

**3. Complications (Surgical Emergencies)**
*   **Intestinal Obstruction:** Mass of worms causing blockage (volvulus/intussusception), common in children.
*   **Ectopic Ascariasis:** Wandering worms may block the **biliary duct**, pancreatic duct, or cause appendicitis. Worms may be vomited out or exit via nose/mouth.

---

### Diagnosis
1.  **Stool Examination:** Detection of characteristic eggs (golden brown, mammillated/rough surface).
2.  **Sputum Analysis:** Larvae may be found during the migration phase.
3.  **Blood:** Eosinophilia.
4.  **Imaging:** Barium meal may show worms; Ultrasound for biliary ascariasis.

### Treatment
**Drug of Choice:** [[Albendazole]] (400 mg single dose).

**Alternative Drugs:**
*   **Mebendazole:** 500 mg single dose or 100 mg BD for 3 days.
*   **Pyrantel Pamoate:** 10 mg/kg single dose.
*   **Piperazine:** Used in intestinal obstruction (paralyzes worms without agitating them).

*Note: Treatment reduces worm load but reinfection is common without sanitation improvements.*

---

### Prevention and Control
**1. Primary Prevention (Sanitation & Hygiene)**
*   **Sanitary Barrier:** Prevention of soil pollution via sanitary disposal of human excreta (Use of latrines).
*   **Hygiene:** Washing hands (soap and water) before eating and after defecation.
*   **Food Safety:** Washing raw vegetables and fruits; covering food.

**2. Secondary Prevention (Chemotherapy)**
*   **Mass Drug Administration (MDA):** Periodic deworming of risk groups to reduce morbidity.
*   **Target Groups:** Preschool children, school-age children, women of childbearing age.
*   **WHO Strategy:**
    *   Prevalence >20%: Treat once a year.
    *   Prevalence >50%: Treat twice a year.

**3. National Programme**
*   **[[National Deworming Day]] (NDD):** Observed on **February 10th** and **August 10th** in India.
    *   **Beneficiaries:** Children 1–19 years.
    *   **Dose:**
        *   1–2 years: 200 mg Albendazole (half tablet).
        *   2–19 years: 400 mg Albendazole (full tablet).
