# Epidemiology, Prevention, and Control of Hepatitis B

### **1. Epidemiological Determinants**

**A. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** [[Hepatitis B Virus]] (HBV), a DNA virus belonging to the *Hepadnaviridae* family. It is a 42 nm double-shelled virus, originally known as the **"Dane Particle"**.
*   **Antigens:** The virus has three distinct antigens determining infectivity and immunity,:
    1.  **HBsAg (Surface Antigen):** Also called Australia Antigen. Indicates current infection (acute or chronic),.
    2.  **HBcAg (Core Antigen):** Does not appear alone in serum.
    3.  **HBeAg (Envelope Antigen):** Indicates **active viral replication** and **high infectivity**.
*   **Resistance:** The virus is quite stable and can survive for at least **7 days** on environmental surfaces,. It is destroyed by sodium hypochlorite and heat sterilization.

**B. Reservoir of Infection**
*   **Man** is the only reservoir (cases and carriers),.
*   **Carriers:** Defined as the persistence of [[HBsAg]] for more than **6 months**. Carriers serve as the main reservoir for maintaining the disease in the community.

**C. Infective Material**
*   Contaminated **blood** is the main source.
*   Found in body fluids: Saliva, vaginal secretions, and semen,.

**D. Host Factors**
*   **High Risk Groups:** Surgeons, nurses, laboratory personnel, recipients of blood transfusions, dialysis patients, intravenous drug users, and sex workers.
*   **Age:** Outcome is age-dependent. Chronic infection occurs in ~90% of infants infected perinatally, compared to <5% of adults.

### **2. Modes of Transmission**

HBV is much more infective than HIV (0.0001 ml of blood can transmit HBV vs 0.1 ml for HIV).

1.  **Parenteral/Percutaneous:** Contaminated needles, syringes, IV drug use, tattooing, ear piercing, and accidental inoculation (needle stick injuries),.
2.  **Perinatal (Vertical):** Transmission from carrier mother to infant during birth (most common in high prevalence regions like SE Asia),.
3.  **Sexual Transmission:** Unprotected sex with an infected partner (virus present in semen and vaginal secretions),.
4.  **Horizontal:** Child-to-child transmission through minor cuts or abrasions during play,.

### **3. Incubation Period**
*   **Range:** 30 to 180 days (Average 60–90 days),.
*   **Clinical Relevance:** The long incubation period makes tracing the source difficult.

### **4. Clinical Spectrum & Diagnosis**

**Clinical Course:**
Can range from asymptomatic infection to acute hepatitis, fulminant hepatitis, and chronic carrier state. Chronic infection can lead to **Cirrhosis** and [[Hepatocellular Carcinoma]].

**Serological Profile (The "Holy Grail" for Exams):**

| Marker | Significance |
| :--- | :--- |
| **HBsAg** | **Current Infection** (First marker to appear). Persistence > 6 months = Chronic. |
| **HBeAg** | **High Infectivity** (Active Replication). |
| **Anti-HBc (IgM)** | **Acute Infection** (Best marker for diagnosis of acute phase). |
| **Anti-HBc (IgG)** | **Past Infection** or Chronic Infection (Persists indefinitely). |
| **Anti-HBe** | **Low Infectivity** (Viral replication has stopped). |
| **Anti-HBs** | **Immunity/Recovery** (Appears after clearance or vaccination). |

> **Mnemonic for Serology:**
> *   **s**Ag = **S**urface = **S**howing infection.
> *   **e**Ag = **E**nvelope = **E**xtremely infectious (Replicating).
> *   **c**Ab = **C**ore = **C**aught it (IgM = just caught, IgG = caught long ago).
> *   **s**Ab = **S**urface Antibody = **S**aved (Immune).

### **5. Prevention and Control**

#### **A. Active Immunization (Vaccine)**
The most effective measure is the **Recombinant DNA Yeast-derived vaccine**.

*   **Schedule (Universal Immunization Programme - India):**
    *   **Birth Dose:** Within **24 hours** of birth (Crucial to prevent perinatal transmission),.
    *   **Primary Doses:** At 6, 10, and 14 weeks (given as part of the [[Pentavalent Vaccine]]),.
*   **Dose:**
    *   Pediatric: 0.5 ml.
    *   Adult: 1.0 ml.
*   **Route:** **Intramuscular** (Anterolateral aspect of thigh for infants; Deltoid for adults),. *Never gluteal due to fat deposition*.
*   **Storage:** 2°C to 8°C. **Do not freeze** (It is freeze-sensitive).
*   **Contraindication:** History of anaphylaxis to previous dose.

#### **B. Passive Immunization**
Uses [[Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin]] (HBIG) for immediate, temporary protection.

*   **Indications:**
    1.  Accidental needle stick injury (Post-exposure prophylaxis).
    2.  Newborns of HBsAg+ mothers (along with vaccine).
    3.  Sexual contacts of acute cases.
*   **Timing:** Ideally within **6 hours**, max up to 48 hours.
*   **Dose:** 0.05–0.07 ml/kg.

**Combined Prophylaxis (Active + Passive):**
For infants born to carrier mothers, give **HBIG (0.5 ml) + Hep B Vaccine** at separate sites within 24 hours of birth. This prevents 85-95% of chronic carrier states.

#### **C. General Control Measures**
1.  **Blood Safety:** Mandatory screening of all donated blood for HBsAg.
2.  **Safety Injection Practices:** Use of auto-disable syringes, proper sterilization, and avoiding unnecessary injections.
3.  **Biosafety:** Use of gloves (Universal Precautions) by healthcare workers.
4.  **Lifestyle:** Safe sex practices (condoms), avoidance of shared razors/toothbrushes.
