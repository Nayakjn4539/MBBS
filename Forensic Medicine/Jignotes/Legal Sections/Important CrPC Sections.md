### **Important CrPC Sections: Inquest (Sections 174 & 176)**

An [[Inquest]] is an inquiry or investigation into the cause of death, particularly when the death is sudden, unexplained, unnatural, or suspicious. In India, this procedure is governed by the **Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC)**.

---

### **1. Section 174 CrPC: Police Inquest**

This is the most common type of inquest held in India. It empowers the police to investigate accidental and unnatural deaths.

*   **Authority:** Conducted by a **Police Officer**, usually the Station House Officer (SHO) or an Investigating Officer (I.O.) not below the rank of a **Head Constable**.
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Upon receiving information of an unnatural death (suicide, murder, accident, etc.), the officer informs the nearest **Executive Magistrate**.
    2.  Proceeds to the **Scene of Crime** (SOC).
    3.  Examines the dead body in the presence of two or more respectable inhabitants of the neighborhood (known as **Panchas**).
    4.  Prepares a report known as the **[[Panchnama]]** (Inquest Report).
*   **Contents of Panchnama:**
    *   Apparent cause of death.
    *   Description of wounds, fractures, bruises, and other marks of injury found on the body.
    *   Manner in which marks appear to have been inflicted (weapon used).
*   **Signature:** The report is signed by the Police Officer and the **Panchas**.
*   **Autopsy Requisition:** If there is any doubt regarding the cause of death, the officer forwards the body to the nearest Civil Surgeon or Medical Officer for a [[Medicolegal Autopsy]].

### **2. Section 176 CrPC: Magistrate Inquest**

This is a specialized inquiry conducted by a Magistrate, which is considered superior to a police inquest. It is held in specific, sensitive cases to ensure impartiality.

*   **Authority:** Conducted by a **Magistrate**.
    *   **Executive Magistrate:** District Magistrate (DM), Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM), Tehsildar, etc.
    *   **Judicial Magistrate:** Specifically required for custodial deaths, rapes in custody, etc. (per amendments).
*   **Mandatory Indications:** A Magistrate Inquest is legally required in the following cases,:
    1.  **Custodial Death:** Death in police lock-up or prison.
    2.  **Police Firing:** Death resulting from police firing.
    3.  **Exhumation:** Digging out a buried body.
    4.  **Dowry Death:** Death of a woman within 7 years of marriage under suspicious circumstances (or suicide).
        *   *Note:* According to a Home Ministry circular, it is also conducted if a woman dies in suspicious circumstances within **30 years** of age.
    5.  **Psychiatric Hospital:** Death of a patient in a mental hospital.
*   **Powers:**
    *   The Magistrate can exhume a body (Section 176(3) CrPC).
    *   Can summon witnesses and medical experts.
    *   Holds an inquiry *in addition* to the investigation held by the police.

### **4. Medicolegal Aspects & Doctor's Duty**

*   **Requisition:** A medical officer cannot conduct a medicolegal autopsy without a written requisition/order from the Police (under Sec 174) or Magistrate (under Sec 176),.
*   **Inquest Report:** The doctor must receive and read the inquest report *before* starting the autopsy to understand the preliminary findings and context.
*   **Discrepancies:** If the injuries mentioned in the inquest report do not match the findings on the body (e.g., injuries missed by police), the doctor should show these to the investigating officer to allow for corrections or explanations.
*   **No Jurisdiction:** A medical officer has no jurisdiction; they must conduct an autopsy on any body sent to them by the competent legal authority.

*   **Section 174 CrPC** $\rightarrow$ **Section 194 [[BNSS]]**.
