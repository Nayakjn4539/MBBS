# Pars Planitis (Intermediate Uveitis)

### Definition and Nomenclature
**Pars Planitis** is a specific subset of [[Intermediate Uveitis]] where the primary site of inflammation is the **pars plana** of the [[ciliary body]], peripheral [[retina]], and the underlying [[choroid]].
*   It is considered an **idiopathic** chronic inflammation.
*   The term **Intermediate Uveitis** is a broader term comprising inflammation of the anterior vitreous, peripheral retina, and pars plana.

### Epidemiology
*   **Age:** Typically affects children and young adults (Bimodal onset: 2nd and 4th decade).
*   **Sex:** Males and females are equally affected.
*   **Laterality:** Bilateral in approximately 80% of cases.

### Etiology
In about 85% of cases, the condition is **Idiopathic** (Primary Pars Planitis). However, it can be associated with systemic diseases (Secondary Intermediate Uveitis).

**Common Associations:**
*   [[Multiple Sclerosis]] (Strong association; HLA-DR2 correlation).
*   [[Sarcoidosis]].
*   [[Lyme Disease]].
*   [[Tuberculosis]].
*   [[Syphilis]].
*   [[Inflammatory Bowel Disease]].

### Pathophysiology
*   It is an autoimmune reaction.
*   There is a strong immunogenic predisposition with a positive correlation with **HLA-DR2**.

### Clinical Features
**Symptoms:**
*   **Floaters:** Most common presenting symptom (insidious onset).
*   **Blurring of vision:** Due to vitreous haze or macular edema.
*   **White Eye:** Typically, there is **no pain, redness, or photophobia** (unlike anterior uveitis).

**Signs:**
1.  **Anterior Segment:**
    *   Usually quiet ("White Uveitis").
    *   Minimal [[aqueous flare]] and cells.
    *   Few [[keratic precipitates]] (KPs) may be seen (Spill-over anterior uveitis).
2.  **Vitreous (Hallmark Features):**
    *   **Vitritis:** Cellular infiltration in the vitreous.
    *   **Snowballs:** Whitish, focal inflammatory exudates (aggregates of inflammatory cells) usually found in the inferior vitreous near the [[ora serrata]]. Also referred to as "Ant's eggs" or "Cotton ball opacities".
    *   **Snowbanking:** A grey-white fibrovascular plaque/exudate over the inferior pars plana. This is the **pathognomonic** feature of pars planitis. Best seen with [[indirect ophthalmoscopy]] with scleral indentation.
3.  **Retina:**
    *   Peripheral [[periphlebitis]] (sheathing of terminal venules).

### Clinical Course
The disease is usually chronic and may follow three patterns:
1.  Single, mild self-limiting episode (10%).
2.  Prolonged course without exacerbations (60%).
3.  Chronic smoldering course with multiple acute exacerbations (30%).

### Complications
*   **[[Cystoid Macular Edema]] (CME):** The most common cause of visual loss.
*   **Complicated [[Cataract]]:** Usually posterior subcapsular type.
*   **[[Vitreous Hemorrhage]].**
*   **[[Retinal Detachment]]:** Tractional RD due to cyclitic membranes.
*   **Cyclitic Membrane:** Fibrovascular membrane behind the lens.
*   **Secondary [[Glaucoma]].**
*   **Band-shaped [[Keratopathy]]** (more common in children).

### Differential Diagnosis
*   **Infectious:** Toxocariasis (Peripheral granuloma), Tuberculosis, Syphilis.
*   **Non-Infectious:** Sarcoidosis, Multiple Sclerosis, Behcet’s disease.
*   **Masquerade Syndromes:** Intraocular [[Lymphoma]] (especially in older patients), Amyloidosis.

### Investigations
*   **[[Fundus Fluorescein Angiography]] (FFA):** To detect CME and retinal vasculitis (periphlebitis).
*   **[[Optical Coherence Tomography]] (OCT):** To diagnose and monitor Cystoid Macular Edema (CME).
*   **Ultrasound Biomicroscopy (UBM):** To visualize the pars plana area (snowbanking) if media is hazy.
*   **Systemic Workup:** To rule out Multiple Sclerosis (MRI Brain), Sarcoidosis (Chest X-ray, Serum ACE), Tuberculosis (Mantoux, Chest X-ray), and Syphilis (VDRL/TPHA).

### Treatment
The management follows a **four-step protocol** (Kaplan’s Approach):

**Goal:** To improve vision (treat CME) and prevent complications. Treatment is usually not required for mild vitritis with good vision (6/9 or better).

| Step | Modality | Indication/Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Step 1** | **Corticosteroids** | **Periocular:** Posterior sub-tenon injection of [[triamcinolone]] (preferred).<br>**Systemic:** Oral steroids used if bilateral severe disease or resistant to local therapy. Topical steroids are ineffective for posterior segment inflammation. |
| **Step 2** | **Immunosuppressives** | Used if steroids fail or cause intolerance. Drugs: [[Methotrexate]], [[Azathioprine]], [[Cyclosporine]]. |
| **Step 3** | **Cryotherapy / Laser** | Applied to the area of **snowbanking** to destroy the fibrovascular plaque and reduce neovascularization. |
| **Step 4** | **Pars Plana Vitrectomy (PPV)** | Indicated for:<br>1. Non-resolving vitreous hemorrhage.<br>2. Tractional retinal detachment.<br>3. Epiretinal membranes.<br>4. Persistent CME unresponsive to medical therapy. |

**Clinical Implication:**
*   Always rule out **Multiple Sclerosis** in a young female presenting with intermediate uveitis.
*   **Cystoid Macular Edema** is the primary reason for permanent visual impairment; therefore, monitoring macular status is crucial.
