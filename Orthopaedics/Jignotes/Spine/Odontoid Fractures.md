# [[Spine]] > Odontoid Fractures

### Odontoid Fractures (Dens Fractures)

Fractures of the [[Odontoid process]] (Dens) of the [[Axis vertebra]] (C2) are common cervical spine injuries, accounting for a significant portion of all cervical fractures. They are classified based on the anatomical level of the fracture line.

#### Classification: Anderson and D'Alonzo (1974)

This is the most widely accepted classification system used to guide treatment and prognosis.

| Type | Description | Stability | Healing Potential |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type I** | An oblique fracture through the upper part (tip) of the [[Odontoid process]]. This is essentially an [[avulsion fracture]] where the [[alar ligament]] attaches. | Generally **Stable** | Good (Rare injury) |
| **Type II** | Fracture at the junction of the odontoid process and the body of the axis (the waist). This is the **most common** type. | **Unstable** | Poor. High rate of [[Non-union]] (approx. 36%) due to precarious blood supply and limited periosteal coverage. |
| **Type III** | Fracture extending downwards into the cancellous bone of the [[Body of Axis]] (C2). | Relatively **Stable** | Good. High union rate because it involves the cancellous bone which has a rich blood supply. |

> **Clinical Implication:** **Type II fractures** are notorious for **non-union**. The blood supply to the dens is somewhat retrograde; a fracture at the waist can interrupt vascularity, leading to [[Avascular necrosis]] or failure to unite.

#### Mechanism of Injury
*   **Younger Patients:** Usually high-energy trauma such as **Road Traffic Accidents (RTA)** or diving accidents. Mechanisms include **Hyperflexion** or **Hyperextension**.
*   **Elderly Patients:** Often low-energy trauma, such as simple falls. The dens is osteoporotic and prone to fracture even with minor force.

#### Clinical Features
*   **Pain:** Severe upper neck pain (suboccipital pain), often radiating to the occiput.
*   **Spasm:** Neck muscle spasm and restriction of movement.
*   **Neurological Deficit:** Rare in isolated fractures because the spinal canal is wide at the C1-C2 level. However, if displacement is severe, [[Quadriplegia]] or [[Respiratory arrest]] (due to C3-C5 involvement) can occur.
*   **Patient Posture:** Patients may hold their head rigidly with hands supporting the chin/jaw to prevent movement (similar to [[Cervical spine tuberculosis]]).

#### Imaging
1.  **Plain X-rays:**
    *   **Open Mouth View (Odontoid View):** The best plain film to visualize the dens. Look for the fracture line or lateral displacement of the dens relative to the lateral masses of C1.
    *   **Lateral Cervical View:** Helps assess anterior or posterior displacement and prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
2.  **[[Computed Tomography]] (CT):** The **Gold Standard** for defining the fracture pattern, extent of comminution, and displacement.
3.  **[[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI):** Essential to rule out ligamentous injury (specifically the [[Transverse ligament]]) and spinal cord compression.

#### Management

Treatment depends strictly on the fracture type and the stability of the injury.

**1. Type I Fracture**
*   **Treatment:** Conservative.
*   **Method:** Immobilization with a rigid [[Cervical collar]] (e.g., Philadelphia collar) for 6–8 weeks.
*   **Outcome:** Usually heals uneventfully.

**2. Type II Fracture**
*   **Conservative:**
    *   Indicated for young patients with undisplaced fractures.
    *   **Method:** [[Halo vest]] immobilization or [[Minerva jacket]].
    *   **Risk:** High failure rate in elderly patients or those with significant displacement (>5mm).
*   **Surgical:**
    *   **Indications:** Displacement >5mm, angulation >10 degrees, elderly patients (poor tolerance for Halo vest), and established [[Non-union]].
    *   **Anterior Approach:** [[Anterior Odontoid Screw Fixation]]. A lag screw is passed from the body of C2 up into the dens. Preserves C1-C2 rotation.
    *   **Posterior Approach:** [[Posterior C1-C2 Fusion]] (e.g., using wires, transarticular screws, or pedicle screws). This sacrifices rotation at the atlantoaxial joint but provides rigid stability.

**3. Type III Fracture**
*   **Treatment:** Conservative (Treatment of choice).
*   **Method:** [[Halo-thoracic vest]] or [[Minerva jacket]] for 12 weeks. In compliant patients with undisplaced fractures, a rigid collar (SOMI brace) may suffice.
*   **Outcome:** Excellent union rates due to the large surface area of cancellous bone involved.

#### Complications
1.  **[[Non-union]]:** Most common in Type II fractures. May present as a persistent neck pain or instability (Os Odontoideum).
2.  **[[Malunion]]:** Healing in a deformed position, potentially limiting neck range of motion.
3.  **Neurological Injury:** Delayed myelopathy can occur if unstable fractures are missed or neglected.
4.  **Stiffness:** Loss of 50% of neck rotation if C1-C2 fusion is performed.

### Mnemonic for Prognosis
**"The Higher, The Better... except for the Waist"**
*   **Tip (Type I):** High up, heals well.
*   **Waist (Type II):** The "trouble zone"—high non-union risk.
*   **Body (Type III):** Low down, heals well (cancellous bone).
