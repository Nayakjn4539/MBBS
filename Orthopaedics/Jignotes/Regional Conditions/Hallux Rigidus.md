# Hallux Rigidus

### Definition
**[[Hallux rigidus]]** essentially translates to a "stiff big toe". It is a degenerative condition characterized by [[osteoarthritis]] affecting the first [[metatarsophalangeal joint]] (MTP) of the foot. Unlike [[hallux valgus]], where the toe deviates laterally, hallux rigidus is defined by a restriction of motion, particularly dorsiflexion.

### Etiopathogenesis
The condition is a form of degenerative arthritis caused by wear and tear of the articular cartilage.
*   **Trauma:** It is frequently a sequela of old trauma to the great toe.
*   **Arthritis:** It may arise from generalized osteoarthritis or inflammatory conditions affecting the joint.
*   **Anatomy:** Structural abnormalities, such as a long first metatarsal or an elevated first metatarsal (metatarsus primus elevatus), can increase stress on the joint.
*   **Micro-trauma:** Repetitive stress or stubbing of the toe contributes to chondral damage.

### Clinical Features
Patients typically present with complaints related to mechanical obstruction and pain during ambulation.

*   **Pain:** Localized to the base of the [[great toe]], aggravated by walking, specifically during the "toe-off" phase of gait.
*   **Stiffness:** Marked restriction of movement at the [[metatarsophalangeal joint]].
    *   **Loss of Extension:** Dorsiflexion is primarily affected, making activities like climbing stairs or running difficult.
*   **Swelling:** Enlargement of the joint due to [[synovitis]] and osteophyte formation.
*   **Dorsal Bunio:** A palpable bony prominence (osteophyte) on the dorsal aspect of the first MTP joint is characteristic.
*   **Gait:** The patient may walk on the outer border of the foot (supination) to avoid extending the big toe.

**Clinical Implication:**
A hallmark sign is the inability to extend the big toe while the patient is standing, or pain elicited at the limit of dorsiflexion (impingement of dorsal osteophytes).

### Radiological Features
Plain X-rays (AP and Lateral views) confirm the diagnosis of [[osteoarthritis]].

| **View** | **Findings** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **AP View** | • Narrowing of the [[joint space]].<br>• Subchondral sclerosis.<br>• Periarticular [[osteophytes]] (spurs). |
| **Lateral View** | • **Dorsal Osteophyte:** A prominent spur on the dorsal aspect of the metatarsal head is the classic finding blocking extension.<br>• Flattening of the metatarsal head. |

### Differential Diagnosis
It is crucial to distinguish Hallux Rigidus from other forefoot pathologies:

1.  **[[Hallux valgus]]:** Characterized by lateral deviation of the toe, whereas Hallux Rigidus is characterized by stiffness without significant deviation.
2.  **[[Gout]]:** Acute podagra affects the 1st MTP but presents with acute inflammation (redness, warmth) and tophi.
3.  **[[Turf toe]]:** A hyperextension injury of the 1st MTP joint capsule.

### Management
Treatment aims to relieve pain and improve function.

#### 1. Conservative Management
First-line treatment for mild to moderate cases.
*   **Footwear Modification:**
    *   **Stiff-soled shoes:** A rocker-bottom sole or a stiff insert (carbon fiber plate) reduces the need for MTP joint dorsiflexion during walking.
    *   **Wide toe box:** To accommodate the dorsal bunion/osteophytes.
*   **Medication:** [[NSAIDs]] to reduce pain and inflammation.
*   **Activity Modification:** Avoiding high-impact activities or high heels.

#### 2. Operative Management
Indicated when conservative measures fail and pain/disability persists.

*   **Cheilectomy:**
    *   Removal of the dorsal [[osteophyte]] and the dorsal one-third of the metatarsal head.
    *   **Indication:** Mild to moderate disease with painful dorsal impingement. It improves dorsiflexion.
*   **Arthrodesis (Fusion):**
    *   Fusion of the first MTP joint in a functional position (slight valgus and dorsiflexion).
    *   **Indication:** Severe osteoarthritis or salvage procedure. It provides definitive pain relief but eliminates motion.
*   **Arthroplasty:**
    *   **Excisional Arthroplasty (Keller’s):** Removal of the base of the proximal phalanx. (Less common now due to complications like push-off weakness).
    *   **Joint Replacement:** Replacing joint surfaces (hemi or total). Longevity of implants in the great toe can be an issue compared to major joints.
