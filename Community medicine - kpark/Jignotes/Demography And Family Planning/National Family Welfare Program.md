# [[Demography And Family Planning]] > National Family Welfare Program

### **National Family Welfare Program**

India was the **first country in the world** to launch a nationwide [[Family Planning Programme]] in **1952**. Over the decades, the program has evolved from a purely demographic target-oriented approach to a comprehensive health and welfare package.

### **2. Concept and Definition**

*   **Family Planning vs. Family Welfare:** The program is not just about birth control. It is defined as a way of thinking and living adopted voluntarily to promote the health and welfare of the family group.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Proper spacing and limitation of births.
    *   Advice on sterility/infertility.
    *   Education for parenthood and sex education.
    *   Screening for reproductive pathologies (e.g., Cervical Cancer).
    *   Providing services for unmarried mothers.

> **Note:** The current policy emphasizes **voluntary and informed choice** with full community participation.

### **3. Organizational Structure**

The program operates at multiple levels to ensure grassroots delivery.

*   **Central Level:** Ministry of Health & Family Welfare formulates policy and provides 100% funding (Centrally Sponsored Scheme).
*   **Peripheral Level:**
    *   **Urban:** [[Urban Family Welfare Centres]].
    *   **Rural:** Rural Family Welfare Centres (integrated into PHCs).
    *   **Village:** [[ASHA]] (Accredited Social Health Activist) and Anganwadi Workers act as depot holders and motivators.

### **4. Key Approaches and Strategies**

The program utilizes specific strategies to increase acceptance:

1.  **Cafeteria Approach:**
    *   The user (beneficiary) is offered a variety of contraceptive methods (the "basket of choice") to choose from, rather than being forced into one method.
    *   *Mnemonic:* Just like a **Cafeteria**, pick what suits your appetite (needs)!

2.  **Community Needs Assessment Approach (CNAA):**
    *   Formerly known as the **Target Free Approach (1996)**.
    *   Targets are not set from the "top-down" (Centre to State). Instead, plans are prepared at the grassroots level based on the felt needs of the community.

3.  **Integrated Approach:**
    *   Family planning services are integrated with MCH (Maternal and Child Health) and Nutrition services (under RCH and NRHM) because a healthy child reduces the desire for more children (security effect).

4.  **Social Marketing:**
    *   Selling contraceptives (like Condoms and OCPs) at subsidized prices through retail outlets to make them easily accessible and reduce stigma.
    *   *Examples:* Nirodh (Condoms), Mala-D (OCPs).

5.  **Incentives:**
    *   Cash compensation for loss of wages is provided to acceptors of sterilization (Tubectomy/Vasectomy).

### **5. Contraceptive Methods (The Basket of Choice)**

The program provides the following free of cost or at subsidized rates:

*   **Spacing Methods (Temporary):**
    *   **Barrier:** Male Condoms (*Nirodh*).
    *   **Intra Uterine Contraceptive Devices ([[IUCD]]):** Cu-T 380A (10 years protection) and Cu-T 375 (5 years).
    *   **Oral Contraceptive Pills ([[OCPs]]):** Combined pills (*Mala-N*).
    *   **Emergency Contraception:** E-Pills (Levonorgestrel).
    *   **Newer Additions:**
        *   **Injectable Contraceptive:** MPA (Medroxyprogesterone Acetate) – *Antara* (Every 3 months).
        *   **Centchroman:** Non-steroidal weekly pill – *Chhaya*.

*   **Terminal Methods (Permanent):**
    *   **Male:** [[No Scalpel Vasectomy (NSV)]] – Safer, simpler, less invasive.
    *   **Female:** Tubectomy (Laparoscopic or Minilap).

### **6. Recent Initiatives and Schemes**

*   **[[Mission Parivar Vikas]]:** Launched in 146 high priority districts with TFR > 3.0 to accelerate access to family planning.
*   **Home Delivery of Contraceptives:** [[ASHA]] workers deliver contraceptives at the doorstep (Scheme name: *Home Delivery of Contraceptives by ASHA*).
*   **Pregnancy Testing Kits:** *Nischay* kits available with ASHA for early detection.
*   **Post-Partum IUCD (PPIUCD):** Insertion of IUCD immediately after delivery (highly effective strategy to capture motivated mothers).
*   **Compensation Scheme:** Enhanced compensation for sterilization failure, complications, or death under the Family Planning Indemnity Scheme.

---

### **7. Evaluation Indicators**

To measure the success of the program, the following demographic indicators are monitored:

1.  **[[Total Fertility Rate (TFR)]]:** Average number of children a woman would bear in her lifetime.
    *   *Target:* Replacement level fertility (**TFR = 2.1**).
2.  **[[Couple Protection Rate (CPR)]]:** Percentage of eligible couples effectively protected against childbirth by any approved method.
    *   *Goal:* To achieve NRR = 1, CPR should be > 60%.
3.  **[[Net Reproduction Rate (NRR)]]:** The number of daughters a newborn girl will bear during her lifetime.
    *   *Ultimate Goal:* **NRR = 1** (Replacement Level).

---

### **Clinical Relevance: Counseling**

When counseling a couple for family planning under this program, use the **GATHER** approach:
*   **G** - Greet the client.
*   **A** - Ask about needs.
*   **T** - Tell about available methods.
*   **H** - Help them choose.
*   **E** - Explain how to use.
*   **R** - Return visit/Referral.
