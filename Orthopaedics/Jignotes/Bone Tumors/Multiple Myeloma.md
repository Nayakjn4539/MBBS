# [[Bone Tumors]] > Multiple Myeloma

### Multiple Myeloma (Plasmacytoma)

**Multiple Myeloma** is a malignant proliferation of plasma cells derived from B-cell lineage within the bone marrow. It is the most common primary malignant tumor of the bone (accounting for approx. 50% of all bone tumors).

### Etiology and Epidemiology
*   **Age:** Typically affects adults between **40–60 years**; peak incidence is between **60–70 years**. It is rare under 40.
*   **Sex:** Males are affected more frequently than females (ratio approx. 2:1 to 3:1).
*   **Origin:** Arises from hematopoietic cells (marrow) in the red marrow-containing bones (axial skeleton, flat bones, proximal long bones).

### Pathology
#### 1. Gross Pathology
*   The tumor tissue is soft, friable, and dark red/grey in color (resembling currant jelly).
*   It lies within the medulla, often thinning and breaking the cortex.
*   [[Pathological fractures]] are common due to extensive osteolysis.

#### 2. Microscopic Pathology
*   **Cellular Structure:** Sheets of closely packed **plasma cells** (myeloma cells).
*   **Nucleus:** Eccentric nucleus with chromatin arranged in a **"cartwheel"** or **"clock-face"** pattern.
*   **Cytoplasm:** Abundant basophilic cytoplasm with a perinuclear halo.
*   **Malignancy Signs:** In malignant forms, there is cellular pleomorphism, loss of the perinuclear halo, presence of binucleate cells, and mitotic figures.

### Clinical Features
The onset is usually insidious. The classic presentation can be remembered by the mnemonic **CRAB**.

**C - Calcium (Hypercalcemia)**
*   Increased osteoclastic activity leads to bone resorption and high serum calcium levels.
*   Symptoms: Thirst, polyuria, abdominal pain, confusion.

**R - Renal Failure (Myeloma Kidney)**
*   Caused by tubular obstruction by protein casts ([[Bence Jones proteins]]), hypercalcemia, and amyloidosis.

**A - Anemia**
*   Due to replacement of normal bone marrow by tumor cells.
*   Leads to weakness, fatigue, and pallor.

**B - Bone Lesions (Pain)**
*   **Bone Pain:** The earliest and most common symptom. Usually affects the lumbar/thoracic spine and ribs. Initially intermittent, becoming constant and severe (unrelieved by rest).
*   **Pathological Fractures:** Common in ribs and vertebrae (compression fractures).
*   **Neurological Symptoms:** Spinal cord or nerve root compression due to vertebral collapse or soft tissue extension.

**Other Features:**
*   **Recurrent Infections:** Due to leucopenia and abnormal immunoglobulins.
*   **Bleeding tendencies:** Due to thrombocytopenia.
*   **Amyloidosis:** Occurs in 10–15% of cases.

### Radiological Features (X-ray)
Radiographs are diagnostic in established cases.
1.  **Punched-out Lesions:** Multiple, discrete, round lytic lesions with no reactive sclerosis (sharp margins). Classic **"Raindrop"** appearance in the skull.
2.  **Generalized Osteoporosis:** Diffuse rarefaction of bones, often the only sign in early stages.
3.  **Vertebral Collapse:** Wedge compression fractures of vertebrae.
4.  **Pedicle Sign:** In [[Multiple Myeloma]], the **pedicles are usually spared** (until late stages), whereas in [[Metastatic Bone Disease]], pedicles are destroyed early. This helps differentiate the two.

### Laboratory Investigations
| Test | Finding | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Complete Blood Count** | Low Hb, Thrombocytopenia | Marrow infiltration. |
| **ESR** | **Markedly Raised** (>100 mm/hr) | Almost constant feature. |
| **Serum Calcium** | Elevated | Due to bone resorption. |
| **Serum Alkaline Phosphatase** | **Normal** | Key differentiator. Normal because there is no reactive bone formation (unlike metastasis where it is high). |
| **Serum Electrophoresis** | **M-Spike** (M-band) | Monoclonal spike in Gamma-globulin region (90% cases). |
| **Urine Analysis** | **Bence Jones Proteins** | Light chain immunoglobulins. Precipitate at 50–60°C, dissolve at 100°C, reappear on cooling. |
| **Bone Marrow Biopsy** | Plasmacytosis | >10% plasma cells; definitive diagnosis. |

**Note:** [[Bone Scans]] (Technetium-99m) are often **cold** (false negative) in myeloma because osteoblastic activity is suppressed. **PET-CT** or **MRI** is superior for detection.

### Differential Diagnosis
1.  **Metastatic Bone Disease:** Especially osteolytic secondaries (e.g., from Kidney, Thyroid, Lung).
2.  **Senile Osteoporosis:** Common in the same age group.
3.  **Hyperparathyroidism:** Causes generalized rarefaction and cysts (Brown tumors).

**Comparison: Myeloma vs. Metastasis**
| Feature | Multiple Myeloma | Bone Metastasis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Alk. Phosphatase** | **Normal** | Usually Elevated |
| **Pedicles (Spine)** | Spared (early) | Destroyed (early) |
| **Bone Scan** | Cold (often negative) | Hot (increased uptake) |
| **ESR** | Very High (>100) | Moderately High |

### Treatment
Treatment is primarily medical/chemotherapy. Surgery and Radiotherapy are palliative.

#### 1. Chemotherapy
*   Specific therapy to control cell proliferation.
*   **Regimens:**
    *   **Conventional:** [[Melphalan]] + [[Prednisone]].
    *   **Newer Agents:** [[Thalidomide]], [[Lenalidomide]], [[Bortezomib]] (Proteasome inhibitor).
    *   High dose **VDD** (Vincristine, Doxorubicin, Dexamethasone).

#### 2. Supportive Care
*   **Bisphosphonates:** (e.g., Zoledronic acid) to reduce bone pain and hypercalcemia.
*   Hydration and treatment of renal failure.
*   Antibiotics for infections.

#### 3. Radiotherapy
*   Myeloma is **highly radiosensitive**.
*   Indicated for localized painful bone lesions (Solitary Plasmacytoma) or spinal cord compression.

#### 4. Surgery
*   **Prophylactic Fixation:** Intramedullary nailing for long bones with impending fracture.
*   **Decompression:** Laminectomy for spinal cord compression with neurological deficits.
*   **Vertebroplasty/Kyphoplasty:** Cement injection for painful vertebral collapse.

#### 5. Stem Cell Transplantation
*   Autologous stem cell transplant following high-dose chemotherapy may induce remission.

### Prognosis
*   Generally poor. It is a fatal disease with a median survival of **3 to 5 years**.
*   Solitary Plasmacytoma has a better prognosis but often progresses to multiple myeloma.
