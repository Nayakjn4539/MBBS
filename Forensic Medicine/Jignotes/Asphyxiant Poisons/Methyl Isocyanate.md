# [[Asphyxiant Poisons]] > Methyl Isocyanate

### **Methyl Isocyanate (MIC)**

**Methyl Isocyanate (MIC)** is a colourless, extremely volatile liquid with a sharp, pungent odour that turns into a gas at 39°C. It gained global infamy as the agent responsible for the **[[Bhopal Gas Tragedy]]** in 1984.

### **1. Classification and Uses**
*   **Classification:** It acts as a **Respiratory Irritant** and a **[[Systemic Asphyxiant]]**.
*   **Uses:**
    *   Manufacture of carbamate pesticides (e.g., **[[Carbaryl]]/Sevin**).
    *   Production of polyurethane foams, plastics, and adhesives.
*   **Reactivity:** It is highly reactive and causes an **exothermic reaction** upon contact with water, generating heat and increasing toxicity.

### **2. Clinical Features**
Symptoms appear immediately upon exposure due to its highly irritant nature.

| System | Clinical Manifestations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Ocular** | Intense irritation, lacrimation (tearing), photophobia, profuse eyelid edema, corneal ulceration, and potential permanent **[[blindness]]**. |
| **Respiratory** | Coughing, sneezing, chest pain, sensation of choking/suffocation, dyspnea, and bronchospasm. **[[Pulmonary Edema]]** is the primary cause of death. |
| **Cutaneous** | Erythema, chemical burns, and blisters upon contact with skin. |
| **Gastrointestinal** | Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. |
| **Systemic** | Unconsciousness and death due to respiratory failure. |

### **3. Mechanism of Toxicity**
*   **Local Action:** Direct chemical irritation and necrosis of mucous membranes (eyes and respiratory tract).
*   **Systemic Action:** While primarily an irritant, it acts as an asphyxiant. There is a hypothesis that MIC toxicity involves **carbamylation of haemoglobin** preventing oxygen uptake, or potentially breaking down into **[[Cyanide]]** within the body, leading to histotoxic hypoxia. This explains the cherry-red discolouration of blood seen in victims.

### **4. Medico-Legal Aspect: The Bhopal Gas Tragedy**
This is the world's worst industrial disaster.
*   **Date:** Night of **December 2nd and 3rd, 1984**.
*   **Location:** Union Carbide India Limited pesticide plant in **Bhopal**, Madhya Pradesh.
*   **Event:** Water entered a tank containing **40 tonnes** of MIC. The resulting exothermic reaction increased pressure, causing the safety valve to blow and releasing a massive toxic cloud over the sleeping city.
*   **Mortality:** Thousands died immediately (estimates vary from 2,000 to over 10,000) and hundreds of thousands were injured.
*   **Sequelae:** Survivors suffered chronic respiratory disease (fibrosis), corneal opacities, and psychological trauma.

### **5. Management**
There is no specific antidote, but **Sodium Thiosulfate** is often used based on the cyanide-toxicity hypothesis.

1.  **Decontamination:** Immediate removal from the contaminated environment. Wash eyes and skin with copious amounts of water.
2.  **Airway Management:** Administer 100% Oxygen; treat bronchospasm with bronchodilators.
3.  **Specific Therapy:** **[[Sodium Thiosulfate]]** may be administered intravenously (acts as a sulfur donor to detoxify potential cyanide metabolites).
4.  **Supportive:** Antibiotics for secondary infection and corticosteroids for pulmonary edema/inflammation.

### **6. Autopsy Findings**
In cases of death due to MIC (typically seen in mass disasters):

*   **External:**
    *   **Cherry-red discolouration** of blood and postmortem staining (similar to **[[Carbon Monoxide]]** or **[[Cyanide]]** poisoning).
    *   Severe congestion of the conjunctiva and corneal opacity.
*   **Internal:**
    *   **Lungs:** Gross **[[Pulmonary Edema]]**; lungs are heavy, boggy, and edematous.
    *   **Respiratory Tract:** Necrosis and shedding of the tracheal and bronchial mucosa.
    *   **Brain:** Cerebral edema and petechial haemorrhages.
    *   **Viscera:** **Fatty degeneration** of the liver and **renal tubular necrosis**.

### **Mnemonic for MIC Toxicity**

**"BHOPAL"**
*   **B**lindness (Corneal ulceration)
*   **H**eavy Lungs (Pulmonary Edema)
*   **O**dour (Sharp/Pungent)
*   **P**ink Blood (Cherry Red colour)
*   **A**sphyxiant (Chemical)
*   **L**iver Fatty Changes
