# [[Osteotomy]]

### Definition
**Osteotomy** is a surgical procedure involving the cutting of a bone to shorten, lengthen, or change its alignment. It is performed under direct vision using an [[osteotome]] or a power saw. This contrasts with [[osteoclasis]], which is the manual breaking of a bone without open surgery.

### Indications
Osteotomy is a versatile procedure used for various orthopedic conditions:

*   **Correction of Deformities:**
    *   **Malunion:** To realign fractures that have healed in a deformed position (e.g., [[Cubitus varus]] after supracondylar humerus fracture).
    *   **Congenital/Developmental:** Correction of [[Genu valgum]] (knock knees) or [[Genu varum]] (bow legs) associated with [[Rickets]].
    *   **Hip Dysplasia:** To improve coverage of the femoral head in [[Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH)]] or [[Perthes' disease]].
*   **Osteoarthritis (OA):** To relieve pain by redirecting load-bearing forces away from the damaged part of a joint to the healthy part (e.g., [[High Tibial Osteotomy]] for unicompartmental knee OA).
*   **Limb Length Discrepancy:** To lengthen or shorten a limb (e.g., using the [[Ilizarov technique]]).
*   **Non-union:** To change the mechanics at a fracture site to promote healing (e.g., [[Pauwel’s osteotomy]] for fracture neck of femur).
*   **Ankylosis:** To convert a joint fused in a poor position into a functional position.

### Surgical Instruments
*   **[[Osteotome]]:** A sharp instrument with **both edges beveled**. It is specifically designed to cut bone.
*   **[[Chisel]]:** A sharp instrument with **only one edge beveled**. It is used for shaving or shaping bone surfaces (e.g., removing an osteochondroma).
*   **Power Saws:** Oscillating or reciprocating saws are commonly used in modern practice for precision.

### Types of Osteotomy Techniques

#### 1. Linear Osteotomies (Angular Correction)
*   **Opening Wedge Osteotomy:**
    *   A cut is made, and the bone ends are levered open.
    *   **Effect:** Corrects angulation and **slightly lengthens** the bone.
    *   **Requirement:** Often requires a [[bone graft]] to fill the gap.
*   **Closing Wedge Osteotomy:**
    *   A wedge of bone is removed, and the gap is closed.
    *   **Effect:** Corrects angulation but **slightly shortens** the bone.
    *   **Benefit:** Good bone-to-bone contact promotes faster healing.
*   **Dome (Spherical) Osteotomy:**
    *   A curved cut is made (dome-shaped).
    *   The distal segment rotates around the center of the dome.
    *   **Effect:** Corrects angulation without changing bone length ("neutral wedge").

#### 2. Displacement Osteotomy
*   The shaft is shifted medially or laterally to change the mechanical axis (e.g., [[McMurray’s osteotomy]]).

#### 3. Derotation Osteotomy
*   Used to correct rotational deformities (e.g., femoral anteversion in DDH).

### Preoperative Planning
*   **Templating:** Essential to calculate the exact size of the wedge (angle of correction) using X-rays.
*   **Fixation:** The osteotomy site must be stabilized using internal fixation (plates, screws, blade-plates) or external fixation (Ilizarov) to ensure union.

### Important Named Osteotomies

| **Region** | **Name of Osteotomy** | **Indication/Use** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hip** | **[[McMurray’s osteotomy]]** | Non-union fracture neck femur (Displacement). |
| | **[[Pauwel’s osteotomy]]** | Non-union fracture neck femur (Angulation to convert shear force to compression). |
| | **[[Salter’s osteotomy]]** | DDH (Innominate osteotomy). |
| | **[[Pemberton’s osteotomy]]** | DDH (Pericapsular). |
| | **[[Chiari osteotomy]]** | DDH (Pelvic displacement). |
| | **[[Femoral Varus Derotation Osteotomy (VDRO)]]** | Containment in Perthes’ disease/DDH. |
| **Knee** | **[[High Tibial Osteotomy (HTO)]]** | Medial compartment Osteoarthritis (Genu Varum). |
| | **[[MacEvan’s osteotomy]]** | Genu valgum (Supracondylar medial closing wedge). |
| **Elbow** | **[[French osteotomy]]** | **[[Cubitus varus]]** (Gunstock deformity) following supracondylar fracture. |
| **Foot** | **[[Dwyer’s osteotomy]]** | Calcaneal osteotomy for Varus heel (e.g., in Cerebral Palsy/CTEV). |

### Clinical Implications and Complications
*   **Soft Tissue Tension:** When correcting severe deformities, excessive tension on soft tissues may cause **nerve damage** (e.g., peroneal nerve palsy in valgus correction).
*   **Compartment Syndrome:** Oozing from cut bone surfaces into surrounding tissues can increase pressure; careful monitoring is required post-operatively.
*   **Delayed Union/Non-union:** Risk exists if fixation is inadequate or if the gap in an opening wedge is too large without grafting.
*   **Deformity Recurrence:** Can occur if the underlying pathology (e.g., metabolic bone disease) is not treated or if fixation fails.
