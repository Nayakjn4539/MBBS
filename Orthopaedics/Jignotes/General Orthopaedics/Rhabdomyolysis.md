# Rhabdomyolysis and Crush Syndrome

### Definition
[[Rhabdomyolysis]] is the breakdown of skeletal muscle fibers resulting in the release of muscle fiber contents (myoglobin) into the bloodstream. In the context of trauma, this systemic manifestation of muscle necrosis is often referred to as **[[Crush Syndrome]]**. It is characterized by the massive release of [[myohemoglobin]] into the circulation, which blocks the [[renal tubules]], leading to [[myoglobinuria]] and [[acute renal tubular necrosis]].

### Etiology and Risk Factors
The condition is commonly associated with severe musculoskeletal injuries or compression.
*   **Trauma:** Severe [[crush injuries]] of the limbs and muscles (e.g., building collapse, road traffic accidents).
*   **Iatrogenic:** Prolonged and improper application of a [[tourniquet]].
*   **Complications of other conditions:**
    *   Acute [[compartment syndrome]].
    *   [[Gas gangrene]].

### Pathophysiology
The pathology begins with muscle injury and is exacerbated by reperfusion.

1.  **Muscle Injury:** Direct trauma or ischemia causes death of muscle fibers ([[myonecrosis]]).
2.  **Reperfusion Injury:** When compression is released (e.g., removing a heavy object or tourniquet), oxygenated blood flows through the damaged area. This causes the formation of **reactive oxygen metabolites**, resulting in further tissue damage.
3.  **Release of Toxins:** The damaged muscle cells release intracellular components into the systemic circulation:
    *   **[[Myoglobin]]:** Precipitates in renal tubules.
    *   **[[Potassium]]:** Leads to [[hyperkalemia]].
    *   **Acids:** Leads to [[metabolic acidosis]].
4.  **Renal Impact:** Myoglobin casts block the renal tubules, combined with hypovolemia and acidosis, causing [[acute renal failure]].

### Clinical Features
*   **History:** Significant trauma, entrapment, or prolonged compression.
*   **Local Signs:** The limb may show signs of **crush injury** or [[compartment syndrome]] (swollen, tense, tender).
*   **Systemic Signs:**
    *   **Urine:** Dark, tea-colored or cola-colored urine due to [[myoglobinuria]].
    *   **Renal:** Development of [[oliguria]] or [[anuria]].
    *   **Cardiac:** Arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalance.

### Laboratory Findings
*   **Urine:** Positive for myoglobin.
*   **Serum Electrolytes:**
    *   [[Hyperkalemia]] (High Potassium).
    *   [[Hypocalcemia]] (Low Calcium).
    *   [[Metabolic acidosis]].
*   **Renal Function:** Elevated creatinine and urea (later stages).

### Complications
1.  **[[Acute Renal Failure]]:** Due to acute renal tubular necrosis caused by myoglobin blockage.
2.  **Cardiac Arrest:** Hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and metabolic acidosis may precipitate fatal arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.

### Management
The treatment is directed towards preventing renal failure and managing electrolyte abnormalities.

#### 1. Medical Management
*   **Fluid Resuscitation:** Immediate and large amounts of fluid infusion are crucial to maintain intravascular volume and dissolve metabolites.
*   **Forced Diuresis:** Administration of [[diuretics]] to maintain high urine output and flush myoglobin from the tubules. This is continued until myoglobinuria becomes negligible.
*   **Correction of Acidosis:** Administration of bicarbonate to alkalinize the urine, which prevents the precipitation of myoglobin in the tubules.

#### 2. Surgical Management
*   **Radical Debridement:** Crushed and non-viable tissues must be radically debrided to stop the release of toxins.
*   **Decompression:** If a tight compartment is present, it must be adequately decompressed ([[Fasciotomy]]) to prevent further muscle necrosis.

#### 3. Renal Support
*   **[[Dialysis]]:** May be necessary if renal failure is established and electrolyte imbalances (especially hyperkalemia) cannot be controlled medically.

### Summary of Management Principles

| Modality | Action | Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fluids** | Aggressive IV fluids | Dilute myoglobin, prevent shock |
| **Medication** | Diuretics & Bicarbonate | Forced diuresis, alkalinize urine |
| **Surgery** | Debridement & Fasciotomy | Remove necrotic tissue, relieve pressure |
| **Support** | Dialysis | Manage established renal failure |
