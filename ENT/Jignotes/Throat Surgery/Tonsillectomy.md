# [[Throat Surgery]] > Tonsillectomy

# Tonsillectomy

**Definition**: Surgical removal of the [[Palatine Tonsils]] from the tonsillar fossa. It is one of the most common surgical procedures performed in Otolaryngology,.

### Surgical Anatomy
*   **Location**: The tonsil lies in the tonsillar fossa between the anterior pillar ([[Palatoglossus muscle]]) and the posterior pillar ([[Palatopharyngeus muscle]]),.
*   **Bed of Tonsil**: Formed by the [[Superior Constrictor Muscle]] and styloglossus muscle,.
*   **Capsule**: A well-defined fibrous capsule covers the lateral surface. Between the capsule and the muscular bed lies loose areolar tissue, which provides the plane of dissection during surgery,.
*   **Blood Supply**: Main supply is the **tonsillar branch of the facial artery**,,.
    *   Additional supply: Ascending pharyngeal, lingual (dorsal linguae), ascending palatine, and descending palatine arteries,.
*   **Venous Drainage**: Paratonsillar vein (External palatine vein) pierces the superior constrictor; it is the most common cause of hemorrhage during tonsillectomy,,.
*   **Nerve Supply**: Glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) and lesser palatine nerves. Referred otalgia (ear pain) post-surgery occurs via CN IX,.

### Indications
Decisions for surgery are often based on the frequency and severity of infections or airway obstruction.

**Paradise Criteria for Recurrent Acute Tonsillitis**,,:
*   $\ge$ 7 episodes in the preceding 1 year
*   $\ge$ 5 episodes/year for 2 consecutive years
*   $\ge$ 3 episodes/year for 3 consecutive years
*   Episodes must be disabling and prevent normal functioning.

| Category | Specific Indications |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Absolute Indications** | 1. **Recurrent Infection**: Meeting Paradise criteria.<br>2. **Hypertrophy causing obstruction**: [[Sleep Apnea Syndrome]], [[Cor Pulmonale]], or dysphagia,,.<br>3. **[[Peritonsillar Abscess]] (Quinsy)**: Recurrent attacks or abscess in children (done 4–6 weeks after acute episode),,.<br>4. **Suspected Malignancy**: Unilateral enlargement or ulceration,.<br>5. **Febrile Seizures**: Caused by tonsillitis. |
| **Relative Indications** | 1. **Chronic Tonsillitis**: Persistent sore throat, halitosis, or bad taste unresponsive to medical therapy,.<br>2. **Carrier State**: Streptococcal or Diphtheria carriers causing risk to others,.<br>3. **Surgical Approach**: Access for [[Glossopharyngeal Neuralgia]] or removal of elongated styloid process ([[Eagle's Syndrome]]),,.<br>4. **Tonsilloliths**: Chronic formation of tonsil stones causing discomfort. |

> **Clinical Implication**: In children with sleep apnea, tonsillectomy is often combined with [[Adenoidectomy]] (Adenotonsillectomy) to relieve upper airway obstruction.

### Contraindications

**Absolute Contraindications**,,:
*   **Bleeding disorders**: Leukemia, Hemophilia, Purpura, Aplastic anemia (unless corrected).
*   **Acute Infection**: Surgery during acute tonsillitis increases bleeding risk; wait 2–3 weeks post-infection.
*   **Polio Epidemic**: Risk of bulbar poliomyelitis due to exposed nerve endings in the pharynx.

**Relative Contraindications**,:
*   **Hb < 10 g%**: Anemia must be corrected.
*   **Age < 3 years**: Due to small blood volume and surgical risk.
*   **Cleft Palate**: Overt or submucous cleft palate (risk of [[Velopharyngeal Insufficiency]] and hypernasality post-op).
*   **Uncontrolled Systemic Disease**: Diabetes, cardiac disease, or hypertension.
*   **Menstruation**: Usually avoided due to hormonal vascular changes.

**Mnemonic for Contraindications: "ABC Polio"**
*   **A**cute infection / **A**nemia / **A**ge < 3
*   **B**leeding disorders
*   **C**left palate
*   **Polio** epidemic

### Surgical Techniques

Methods are broadly classified into **Cold** (no heat) and **Hot** (thermal) techniques.

| Technique | Description | Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dissection and Snare** (Cold) | Traditional method using sharp dissection and wire snare,. | Less post-op pain, less thermal injury, low cost,. | Higher intra-operative blood loss. |
| **Guillotine** (Cold) | Older method using a guillotine instrument. | Fast. | Obsolete; high recurrence if tags left; only for mobile tonsils. |
| **Electrocautery/ Diathermy** (Hot) | Uses monopolar or bipolar current to cut and coagulate,. | Reduced intra-operative bleeding. | Higher thermal injury risk, increased post-op pain. |
| **Coblation** (Hot) | Radiofrequency energy with saline to break molecular bonds at low temp (40–70°C),. | Less thermal damage, less pain than cautery,. | Expensive wands; risk of secondary hemorrhage. |
| **Laser** (KTP/CO2) | Vaporization of tissue. | Good hemostasis; useful in bleeding disorders. | Delayed healing, expensive. |
| **Microdebrider** | Powered shaving device (often intracapsular). | Precise, less pain (if capsule preserved). | Potential for regrowth if tissue left behind. |

### Steps of Surgery (Dissection Method)

**1. Pre-operative**: Check coagulation profile (PT/APTT), loose teeth, and fitness for GA,.
**2. Anesthesia**: General Anesthesia with endotracheal intubation,.
**3. Position**: **Rose’s Position**,,.
    *   Supine with a sandbag under the shoulders.
    *   Head extended at the atlanto-occipital joint (to prevent aspiration).
**4. Exposure**:
    *   **Boyle-Davis Mouth Gag**: Opens mouth and depresses tongue.
    *   **Draffin’s Bipod Stand**: Supports the mouth gag,.
    *   **Throat Pack**: Placed to prevent aspiration of blood.
**5. Grasping**: The tonsil is grasped with **Dennis-Browne tonsil holding forceps** and pulled medially,.
**6. Incision**: A mucosal incision is made at the upper pole (plica semilunaris) using a tonsillar knife or Waugh’s dissector,.
**7. Dissection**:
    *   The tonsil is separated from the bed (superior constrictor) in the loose areolar tissue plane.
    *   Instrument: **Mollison’s tonsillar dissector** (blunt end),.
    *   Dissection proceeds from the upper pole towards the lower pole.
**8. Snaring**: The pedicle at the lower pole is crushed and cut using **Eve’s Tonsillar Snare** to minimize bleeding,,.
**9. Hemostasis**:
    *   Pack the fossa with gauze.
    *   Ligate bleeding vessels (usually paratonsillar vein) with silk ties or use bipolar diathermy,.
    *   Common instruments: **Birkett’s** or **Negus artery forceps**,.

### Complications

#### 1. Hemorrhage (Most Common),,,
*   **Primary Hemorrhage**: Occurs *during* surgery.
    *   *Cause*: Injury to paratonsillar vein or aberrant arteries.
    *   *Management*: Diathermy, ligation, or packing.
*   **Reactionary Hemorrhage**: Occurs *within 24 hours* post-op.
    *   *Cause*: Dislodgement of clot, slipping of ligature, or normalization of BP (hypotension wears off).
    *   *Management*: Remove clot, apply pressure/vasoconstrictor. If it fails, return to OT for ligation/cautery,,.
*   **Secondary Hemorrhage**: Occurs *5–10 days* post-op.
    *   *Cause*: **Infection** leading to premature separation of slough.
    *   *Management*: Admit patient, IV antibiotics, hydrogen peroxide gargles. Surgery is rarely needed unless severe,,,.

#### 2. Respiratory/Airway
*   **Aspiration (Coroner’s Clot)**: Aspiration of a large blood clot causing sudden airway obstruction and death,,.
*   **Pulmonary Edema**: Relief of chronic obstruction (e.g., in severe OSA) causes sudden drop in intrathoracic pressure leading to edema,.
*   **Surgical Emphysema**: Air enters neck tissues due to superior constrictor injury,.

#### 3. Anatomical/Functional
*   **Injury**: To pillars, uvula, teeth, tongue, or nerves (lingual, glossopharyngeal),,.
*   **Velopharyngeal Insufficiency (VPI)**: Nasal regurgitation and hypernasal speech (Rhinolalia Aperta), especially if submucous cleft palate was missed,,.
*   **Grisel’s Syndrome**: Atlanto-axial subluxation due to inflammatory laxity of ligaments post-infection/surgery, causing torticollis,,.
*   **Referred Otalgia**: Ear pain via the tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve,.

---

### Post-Operative Care,,
1.  **Position**: Place patient in **lateral recovery (coma) position** until fully awake to prevent aspiration of blood/secretions.
2.  **Monitoring**: Watch for frequent swallowing (sign of active bleeding) and rising pulse rate,.
3.  **Diet**:
    *   Cold fluids/ice cream initially (vasoconstriction and soothing).
    *   Soft diet started the next day.
    *   Avoid red-colored foods (confuses with blood) and rough/spicy foods.
4.  **Oral Hygiene**: Alkaline or saline gargles to keep the fossa clean.
5.  **Analgesia**: Paracetamol or opioids. Avoid Aspirin (increases bleeding risk).
6.  **Discharge**: Usually after 24 hours if no complications; earlier in day-care settings.
