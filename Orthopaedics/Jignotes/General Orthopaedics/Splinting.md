# Splinting

### Definition
A [[splint]] is a device used for the support or immobilization of a limb or the spine. It can range from unconventional materials used in emergencies to sophisticated thermoplastic devices. Essentially, any material used to support a [[fracture]] is considered a splint,.

### Objectives and Functions
The primary goals of applying a splint are:
*   **Temporary Immobilization:** For [[sprains]], fractures, and reduced [[dislocations]] to maintain alignment.
*   **Pain Control:** Preventing movement of injured parts significantly reduces pain and muscle spasm,.
*   **Transportation:** Facilitates the safe transfer of the patient from the site of injury to the hospital.
*   **Protection:** Prevention of further soft tissue injury (e.g., converting a closed fracture into an open fracture) or [[neurovascular injury]] during movement.

### Classification of Splints

#### 1. Based on Material
*   **Unconventional (Improvisation) Splints:** Used in first aid when standard equipment is unavailable. Examples: Folded newspapers, cardboard, wood, pillows, umbrellas, or sticks,.
*   **Conventional Splints:** Standard medical devices.
    *   [[Plaster of Paris]] (POP) slabs/casts.
    *   [[Metallic splints]] (e.g., Thomas splint, Cramer-wire).
    *   [[Pneumatic splints]] (inflatable).
    *   [[Thermoplastics]].

#### 2. Based on Biomechanics
*   **Static Splints:** Provide rigid support and allow no movement (e.g., Cock-up splint for [[radial nerve palsy]]),.
*   **Dynamic Splints:** Provide support but also assist or allow movement of recovering or uninjured structures (e.g., Dynamic cock-up splint allows finger flexion while supporting the wrist).

### Specific Important Splints

#### 1. Thomas Splint
Originally designed by **Hugh Owen Thomas** for [[Tuberculosis of the knee]] ("Thomas' bed knee splint"), it is now widely used for femoral fractures.

*   **Structure/Parts:**
    1.  **Ring:** A well-padded oval or circular ring. It is set at an angle of **120°** to the inner bar to conform to the groin,.
    2.  **Side Bars:** Two side bars (inner and outer). The outer bar is longer. The outer bar is angled **2 inches (approx 5 cm)** below the ring to accommodate the [[greater trochanter]].
    3.  **Distal End:** The bars converge and are joined in a **'W' shape** to allow attachment of traction cords,.
*   **Measurement:**
    *   **Ring Size:** Oblique circumference of the thigh at the groin + **4 inches**.
    *   **Length:** Length of the normal limb + **6 inches**.

#### 2. Bohler-Braun Splint
A heavy metallic frame used for femoral and tibial fractures. It features a system of **four pulleys**:
1.  **Proximal pulley:** Prevents [[foot drop]].
2.  **Second pulley:** Applies traction in the line of the femur.
3.  **Third pulley:** Applies traction in the line of the tibia.
4.  **Fourth pulley:** Not explicitly detailed in text, but generally for counter-traction or suspension adjustments.
*   **Advantages:** No ring to cause pressure sores in the groin; useful for comminuted fractures.

### Principles of Splint Application

When applying splints, especially in an emergency setting, specific steps must be followed to ensure safety and effectiveness:

1.  **Safety First:** Ensure the scene is safe and use universal precautions.
2.  **Assessment:** Check distal **CMS** (Circulation, Motor, Sensory) function *before* splinting.
3.  **Exposure:** Expose the injured area to identify wounds or deformity.
4.  **Measurement:** Select and measure the appropriate splint on the uninjured limb.
5.  **Application:**
    *   Apply manual stabilization.
    *   Immobilize the **joint above** and the **joint below** the injury site.
    *   For the hand/foot, immobilize in the **position of function**.
6.  **Padding:** Adequately pad bony prominences to prevent [[pressure sores]].
7.  **Re-assessment:** Recheck distal CMS after application to ensure the bandage is not too tight.

**Clinical Implication:**
In [[Colles' fracture]], a below-elbow cast often suffices, but the general rule remains to immobilize the joint above and below.

### Care of Patient in a Splint
*   **Tightness:** The bandage should not be too tight (risk of [[ischemia]]/sores) nor too loose (ineffective).
*   **Exercise:** Encourage active exercise of joints *inside* and *outside* the splint as permitted,.
*   **Monitoring:** Daily checks for neurovascular status (numbness, tingling, swelling) and pressure points,.

### Mnemonic for Splint Application Assessment
**The 6 P's** (To monitor neurovascular status after splinting):
*   **P**ain (especially on passive stretch - sign of [[Compartment Syndrome]])
*   **P**allor
*   **P**ulselessness
*   **P**aresthesia
*   **P**aralysis
*   **P**oikilothermia (Cold limb)
*(Note: Pain is usually the earliest sign; Pulselessness is a late sign)*,.
