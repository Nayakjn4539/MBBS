# Ankylosing Spondylitis (Marie-Strumpell Disease)

### Definition and Overview
[[Ankylosing Spondylitis]] (AS) is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology that primarily affects the **axial skeleton** (sacroiliac joints and spine). It belongs to the group of **Seronegative Spondyloarthropathies**.
*   **Synonyms:** Marie-Strumpell disease, Bechterew’s disease.
*   **Hallmark:** Inflammation of the insertions of ligaments and tendons into bone ([[Enthesopathy]]) leading to fibrosis, ossification, and eventually bony fusion ([[Ankylosis]]).

### Epidemiology and Etiology
*   **Age:** Young adults, typically **15–30 years** (Peak: 20–40 years). Rarely begins after 45.
*   **Sex:** Strong male preponderance (Males > Females, approx 3:1 to 9:1).
*   **Genetics:** Strong association with **[[HLA-B27]]** antigen (Positive in >90% of AS patients).
*   **Serology:** Seronegative (Rheumatoid Factor negative).

### Pathophysiology
The disease process ascends from the pelvis (sacroiliac joints) upwards to the spine.
1.  **Synovitis:** Initial inflammation of the synovium (sacroiliitis).
2.  **Enthesopathy:** Inflammation at the insertion of the annulus fibrosus and ligaments.
3.  **Ossification:** Healing occurs via fibrosis and calcification.
4.  **Syndesmophyte Formation:** Vertical bony spurs form across the edges of the vertebrae.
5.  **Ankylosis:** Fusion of the [[Sacroiliac Joint]], facet joints, and intervertebral spaces leads to a rigid spine known as "Bamboo Spine."

### Clinical Features
The onset is usually insidious.

#### 1. Articular Symptoms
*   **Low Back Pain:** The earliest and most common symptom.
    *   **Duration:** Chronic (>3 months).
    *   **Nature:** Inflammatory back pain.
    *   **Rhythm:** **Morning stiffness** lasting >30 minutes.
    *   **Aggravating/Relieving Factors:** **Worse with rest**, improves with exercise/activity.
*   **Gluteal Pain:** Often alternating buttock pain.
*   **Root Joint Involvement:** Hips and shoulders may be involved (Rhizomelic distribution). Hip involvement can lead to severe disability.
*   **Peripheral Arthritis:** Asymmetrical oligoarthritis (knees, ankles) occurs in ~30% of cases.

#### 2. Examination Findings
*   **Posture:** Loss of normal lumbar lordosis and increased thoracic kyphosis ("Question Mark" posture).
*   **Tenderness:** Over sacroiliac joints and spinous processes.
*   **Limited Mobility:** Restriction of spinal movements in all planes (flexion, extension, lateral flexion).

#### 3. Extra-Articular Manifestations
*   **Ocular:** **[[Acute Anterior Uveitis]]** (Iritis) – Most common (25–30%). Presents with red, painful eye and photophobia.
*   **Pulmonary:** Apical pulmonary fibrosis, restricted chest expansion.
*   **Cardiac:** Aortic regurgitation, conduction defects (AV blocks).
*   **Neurological:** Atlantoaxial subluxation, Cauda Equina syndrome (rare).
*   **Renal:** Secondary [[Amyloidosis]].

**Clinical Implication:** Patients with AS have brittle, osteoporotic spines. Even minor trauma can cause disastrous fractures, typically through the cervical spine.

### Clinical Tests
| Test | Description | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Schober’s Test]]** | Marks are made 10 cm above and 5 cm below S1. Patient bends forward. | **Positive:** Increase in distance is <5 cm (Normal spine distraction is >5 cm). Indicates reduced lumbar flexion. |
| **Chest Expansion** | Measured at the 4th intercostal space. | **Restricted:** Expansion < 2.5 cm indicates costovertebral joint involvement. |
| **Occiput-to-Wall Test** | Patient stands with heels/back against wall; attempts to touch occiput to wall. | **Positive:** Inability to touch the wall (Flesche test) indicates severe cervicothoracic kyphosis. |
| **Sacroiliac Tests** | Pump handle test, Gaenslen’s test, FABER test. | Pain indicates sacroiliitis. |

### Investigations

#### 1. Laboratory Findings
*   **HLA-B27:** Positive in ~90–95% of patients (Note: Positivity alone is not diagnostic as it is present in 6–8% of the normal population).
*   **Inflammatory Markers:** [[ESR]] and [[C-Reactive Protein]] (CRP) are elevated during active disease.
*   **Rheumatoid Factor:** Negative.

#### 2. Radiology (X-Ray)
Changes appear first in SI joints, then the spine.
*   **Sacroiliac Joints (SIJ):**
    *   Stage 1: Blurring of joint margins (Pseudowidening).
    *   Stage 2: Erosions and "rosary bead" appearance.
    *   Stage 3: Sclerosis.
    *   Stage 4: Complete bony **Ankylosis** (Joint space obliterated).
*   **Spine:**
    *   **Squaring of Vertebrae:** Loss of anterior concavity of vertebral bodies.
    *   **[[Syndesmophytes]]:** Vertical bony outgrowths bridging adjacent vertebrae (ossification of outer annulus fibrosus).
    *   **[[Bamboo Spine]]:** Appearance resulting from widespread syndesmophytes and calcification of the anterior longitudinal ligament.
    *   **[[Dagger Sign]]:** Single central radiodense line due to ossification of supraspinous and interspinous ligaments.
    *   **Trolley Track Sign:** Three parallel vertical dense lines (ossification of facet joint capsules + ligaments).

#### 3. Advanced Imaging
*   **[[MRI]]:** Most sensitive for early diagnosis. Detects bone marrow edema/sacroiliitis before X-ray changes become visible.

### Diagnosis Criteria (Modified New York Criteria)
Diagnosis requires **Radiological Criterion** + at least **One Clinical Criterion**.

1.  **Radiological Criterion:**
    *   Sacroiliitis: Grade ≥2 bilaterally OR Grade 3–4 unilaterally.
2.  **Clinical Criteria:**
    *   Low back pain and stiffness for >3 months, improves with exercise, not relieved by rest.
    *   Limitation of motion of lumbar spine in both sagittal and frontal planes.
    *   Limitation of chest expansion relative to normal values for age and sex.

### Differential Diagnosis
1.  **[[Mechanical Back Pain]]:** Pain worsens with activity/exercise, relieved by rest. No morning stiffness.
2.  **[[Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis]] (DISH):** Calcification of ligaments (flowing wax appearance) but **preserved disc height** and **spared SI joints**. Usually elderly.
3.  **Other Spondyloarthropathies:** Psoriatic arthritis, Reactive arthritis (Reiter's).

### Management

#### 1. General Measures & Physiotherapy (Crucial)
*   **Goal:** Maintain mobility and posture.
*   **Exercise:** Swimming and spinal extension exercises are ideal.
*   **Posture:** Sleeping on a hard bed with a thin pillow; conscious effort to maintain erect posture to prevent kyphosis.
*   **Counseling:** Cessation of smoking (smoking worsens spinal fusion).

#### 2. Pharmacotherapy
*   **NSAIDs:** (e.g., Indomethacin, Naproxen). First-line treatment for pain and stiffness.
*   **DMARDs:** (e.g., Sulfasalazine). Generally **not effective for axial/spinal disease**; used for peripheral joint involvement.
*   **Biologics ([[TNF-alpha inhibitors]]):** (e.g., Infliximab, Etanercept, Adalimumab). Highly effective for axial disease resistant to NSAIDs. They reduce inflammation and may slow radiographic progression.

#### 3. Surgical Treatment
*   **Total Hip Replacement ([[THR]]):** For patients with severe hip ankylosis/arthritis (common indication).
*   **Vertebral Osteotomy:** (e.g., Smith-Peterson osteotomy, Pedicle subtraction osteotomy). Indicated for severe, fixed kyphotic deformity (Chin-on-chest deformity) to improve horizontal gaze.
