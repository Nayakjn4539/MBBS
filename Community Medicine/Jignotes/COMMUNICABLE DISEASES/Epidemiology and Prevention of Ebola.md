# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Epidemiology and Prevention of Ebola

# Epidemiology and Prevention of Ebola Virus Disease

### 1. Introduction and Problem Statement
*   **Definition:** [[Ebola Virus Disease]] (EVD), formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is a severe, infectious, and often fatal disease in humans and primates.
*   **Origin:** First appeared in 1976 in simultaneous outbreaks in Nzara (Sudan) and Yambuku (Zaire, now DRC).
*   **Case Fatality Rate:** Extremely high, estimated between 40% to 70% (varies by outbreak and strain).

### 2. Epidemiological Determinants

#### A. Agent Factors
*   **Agent:** [[Ebola virus]], a member of the **Filoviridae** family.
*   **Structure:** Long, filamentous, single-stranded RNA virus.
*   **Species:** There are 5 distinct species:
    1.  *Zaire ebolavirus*
    2.  *Sudan ebolavirus*
    3.  *Bundibugyo ebolavirus*
    4.  *Tai Forest ebolavirus*
    5.  *Reston ebolavirus*

> **Mnemonic for Species:** **R**eston **B**undibugyo **S**udan **T**ai **Z**aire  
> *"**R**eally **B**ad **S**ymptoms **T**arget **Z**one"*

#### B. Host Factors
*   **Natural Reservoir:** [[Fruit bats]] of the Pteropodidae family.
*   **Hosts:** Humans and primates (chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys).
*   **Infectivity:** Patients are **not** infective during the incubation period. They become infectious only after developing symptoms. Asymptomatic cases are not infective.

#### C. Environmental Factors
*   **Setting:** Strikes mainly in villages of Central and West Africa, near tropical rainforests, but can spread to urban areas.
*   **Transmission Risk:** Direct contact with infected animals or humans.

### 3. Mode of Transmission
Transmission occurs via the following routes:
1.  **Animal-to-Human (Spillover):** Direct contact with blood, secretions, organs, or bodily fluids of infected animals (chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys) found ill or dead in the rainforest.
2.  **Human-to-Human:**
    *   Direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with **blood or body fluids** (urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomit, breast milk, semen) of a symptomatic person.
    *   **Note:** Semen can transmit the virus for a prolonged period after recovery.
3.  **Fomites:** Contact with objects (e.g., bedding, clothing, needles) contaminated with infected fluids.
4.  **Nosocomial:** Healthcare workers are at high risk if [[Universal Precautions]] and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) are not strictly followed.

**Important:** Ebola is **NOT** transmitted through air, water, or food.

### 4. Clinical Features
*   **Incubation Period:** 2 to 21 days.
*   **Clinical Presentation:**
    *   **Initial Symptoms:** Sudden onset of high fever (at least 38.8°C), intense weakness, muscle pain, headache, and sore throat.
    *   **Late Symptoms:** Vomiting, diarrhea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function.
    *   **Hemorrhagic Phase:** In some cases, both internal and external bleeding (e.g., oozing from gums, blood in stools).
    *   **Lab Findings:** Low white blood cell count (leukopenia), low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), elevated liver enzymes.

### 5. Diagnosis
Diagnosing early can be difficult as symptoms are non-specific. Confirmation requires the following laboratory tests:
*   **RT-PCR** (Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction) [[Gold Standard]].
*   **ELISA** (Antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay).
*   Antigen-capture detection tests.
*   Serum neutralization test.
*   Electron microscopy.
*   Virus isolation by cell culture.

### 6. Treatment
There is no specific licensed treatment mentioned in the primary texts, though new therapies are constantly under evaluation. Management is primarily **supportive**:
*   **Rehydration:** Oral rehydration with electrolyte solutions or Intravenous fluids.
*   **Symptomatic care:** Managing fever, pain, and coinfections.
*   **Objective:** Intensive supportive care reduces mortality.

### 7. Prevention and Control
As per available sources, prevention relies on breaking the chain of transmission.

| Measure | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Isolation** | Suspected and confirmed cases must be isolated immediately to prevent spread to the community and family members. |
| **Contact Tracing** | Identifying and monitoring everyone who has had contact with a person infected with Ebola for 21 days. |
| **Protective Equipment** | Healthcare workers must use rigorous [[Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)]] (gloves, gowns, masks, goggles) and practice strict infection control. |
| **Safe Burial** | Victims of Ebola remain contagious after death. Safe and dignified burial practices are essential to prevent transmission during funeral rites. |
| **Hygiene** | Regular hand washing. Disinfection of contaminated surfaces. |
| **Avoid Contact** | Avoid contact with infected bats, monkeys, and apes; do not consume their raw meat. Avoid sexual contact with survivors until semen tests negative. |

**Clinical Relevance:**
High index of suspicion is required for any patient presenting with fever and history of travel to endemic areas (e.g., Central/West Africa) within the last 21 days. Immediate notification to health authorities is mandatory.
