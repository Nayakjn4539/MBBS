# [[Diseases Of Conjunctiva]] > Pterygium and Pinguecula

### Pinguecula

**Definition**
A [[Pinguecula]] is an extremely common, localized, degenerative condition of the [[Conjunctiva]] characterized by the formation of a yellowish-white patch on the [[Bulbar Conjunctiva]] near the [[Limbus]].
*   **Etymology:** Derived from *Pinguis* (Latin), meaning fat (due to its resemblance to fat), though it consists of degenerative tissue, not fat.

**Etiology and Pathology**
*   **Age:** Common in elderly people; considered an age-related change.
*   **Environmental Factors:** Associated with prolonged exposure to:
    *   Strong sunlight (UV radiation).
    *   Dust.
    *   Wind.
*   **Histopathology:**
    *   **Elastotic degeneration:** Degeneration of collagen fibers of the substantia propria.
    *   **Hyaline infiltration:** Deposition of amorphous hyaline material.
    *   **Epithelial changes:** Thinning of the epithelium; occasionally calcification occurs.

**Clinical Features**
*   **Appearance:** A triangular, yellowish-white nodule/patch.
*   **Location:**
    *   Situates near the limbus in the palpebral aperture (interpalpebral zone).
    *   **Apex:** Points *away* from the [[Cornea]].
    *   **Side:** Affects the **Nasal** side first and more frequently than the temporal side.
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Usually asymptomatic.
    *   Cosmetic concern.
    *   Foreign body sensation or dry eye symptoms if elevated.
    *   **Pingueculitis:** The lesion can become inflamed, causing localized redness and irritation.

**Treatment**
*   **No Treatment:** Usually required for asymptomatic cases.
*   **Medical:**
    *   Artificial tears/lubricating drops for irritation.
    *   Short course of weak topical **Steroids** (e.g., Fluorometholone) if inflamed (Pingueculitis).
*   **Surgical:** Excision is rarely indicated, only if cosmetically unacceptable or interfering with contact lens wear.

### Pterygium

**Definition**
A [[Pterygium]] (Greek: *Pterygion* = a wing) is a wing-shaped, triangular fold of fibrovascular tissue extending from the [[Conjunctiva]] onto the [[Cornea]], encroaching upon the limbus and destroying superficial stromal layers.

**Etiology and Pathogenesis**
*   **Theory:** It is a degenerative and hyperplastic condition.
*   **Primary Cause:** Elastotic degeneration of subconjunctival tissue due to environmental factors.
*   **Risk Factors:**
    *   **Ultraviolet (UV) radiation:** Primary trigger (UV-B).
    *   Dry, hot, and dusty climates ("Pterygium belt" geography).
    *   **Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency:** Focal deficiency at the limbus may allow conjunctival overgrowth.
*   **Pathology:** Subconjunctival tissue undergoes elastotic degeneration and proliferates as vascularized granulation tissue under the epithelium, destroying the [[Bowman's Membrane]] and superficial corneal stroma.

**Anatomy (Parts of Pterygium)**
1.  **Head:** Apical part present on the cornea.
2.  **Neck:** Constricted part present at the limbus.
3.  **Body:** Scleral part extending between the limbus and canthus.
4.  **Cap:** A semilunar whitish infiltrate present in the cornea *just in front* of the head (Halo of Pterygium).

**Classification**
| Progressive Pterygium | Regressive (Atrophic) Pterygium |
| :--- | :--- |
| Thick, fleshy, and vascular. | Thin, atrophic, membranous. |
| **Vascularity:** Prominent. | **Vascularity:** Very little/attenuated. |
| **Cap/Infiltrates:** Present (Islets of Vogt). | **Cap:** Absent. |
| Actively encroaching cornea. | Stationary; never disappears but growth halts. |

**Clinical Features**
*   **Laterality:** Often bilateral, but asymmetrical.
*   **Location:** **Nasal** > Temporal.
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Asymptomatic (cosmetic intolerance).
    *   Foreign body sensation/irritation.
    *   **Visual Disturbance:**
        *   **Astigmatism:** Induces **With-The-Rule Astigmatism** (flattening of the horizontal meridian).
        *   Occlusion of the visual axis (encroachment over pupil).
    *   Diplopia (rare) due to restriction of ocular motility (symblepharon effect).
*   **Specific Signs:**
    *   **Stocker's Line:** Linear iron deposition in the corneal epithelium anterior to the head of the pterygium.
    *   **Fuchs' Spots (Islets of Vogt):** Small whitish infiltrates in the cornea near the head.

**Differential Diagnosis: Pterygium vs. [[Pseudopterygium]]**

| Feature | [[Pterygium]] | [[Pseudopterygium]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Etiology** | Degenerative process. | Inflammatory process (Burns, Ulcers). |
| **Site** | Always in palpebral aperture (Horizontal). | Can occur at any site (any meridian). |
| **Probe Test** | **Probe CANNOT be passed** under the neck. | **Probe CAN be passed** under the neck. |
| **Course** | Progressive or Stationary. | Always Stationary. |
| **Age** | Usually elderly/adults. | Any age. |

**Treatment**
**1. Medical Management (Conservative)**
*   **Indications:** Early stages, asymptomatic, or patient unfit for surgery.
*   [[Sunglasses]]: To reduce UV exposure and slow growth.
*   **Lubricants:** Tear substitutes for dryness/foreign body sensation.
*   **Topical Steroids:** Only for inflamed pterygium.

**2. Surgical Management**
*   **Indications for Surgery:**
    *   Visual axis encroachment (encroaching pupillary area).
    *   Significant induced [[Astigmatism]].
    *   Cosmetic disfigurement.
    *   Restriction of eye movement (Diplopia).
    *   Chronic irritation not relieved by meds.

*   **Surgical Techniques:**
    *   **Excision with Bare Sclera:** High recurrence rate (up to 50-80%). *Obsolete/Not recommended.*
    *   **Excision with Conjunctival Limbal Autograft ([[CLAU]]):** **Gold Standard.**
        *   Technique: Pterygium excised, and bare sclera covered with free graft from superotemporal bulbar conjunctiva of the same eye.
        *   Fixation: Sutures (10-0 nylon/vicryl) or **Fibrin Glue** (reduces surgery time and discomfort) or patient's own blood (autologous blood).
        *   Lowest recurrence rate.
    *   **Amniotic Membrane Grafting (AMG):** Used for large/recurrent pterygia where conjunctiva is insufficient.
    *   **Adjunctive Therapies (To prevent recurrence):**
        *   **Mitomycin C (MMC):** Intraoperative application (0.02% for 2-3 mins). *Caution:* Risk of scleral necrosis/melting.
        *   **Beta-irradiation:** (Historical significance).

**Complications of Surgery**
*   **Recurrence:** Most common complication.
*   Granuloma formation.
*   Dellen formation (corneal thinning due to drying).
*   Scleral thinning/necrosis (if MMC used excessively).
