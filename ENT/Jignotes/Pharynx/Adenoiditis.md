# ADENOIDITIS AND ADENOID HYPERTROPHY

The [[adenoids]], also known as the **nasopharyngeal tonsil** or **Luschka’s tonsil**, are a subepithelial collection of lymphoid tissue situated at the junction of the roof and the posterior wall of the [[nasopharynx]]. They form the superior component of [[Waldeyer's ring]].

### Surgical Anatomy
*   **Structure:** Composed of vertical ridges of lymphoid tissue separated by deep clefts. Unlike [[palatine tonsils]], adenoids have **no capsule** and **no crypts**.
*   **Epithelium:** Covered mainly by **ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium** (respiratory epithelium), with some stratified squamous and transitional areas.
*   **Development:**
    *   Present at birth.
    *   Physiological enlargement occurs between **3 and 7 years** (peak immunologically active age).
    *   Atrophy begins at puberty and is usually complete by age 20.
*   **Blood Supply:**
    *   Ascending palatine artery (Facial artery).
    *   Ascending pharyngeal artery (External Carotid).
    *   Pharyngeal branch of [[internal maxillary artery]].
    *   Ascending cervical artery.
*   **Nerve Supply:** CN IX (Glossopharyngeal) and CN X (Vagus).

### Etiology and Pathogenesis
**Chronic Adenoiditis** is a chronic inflammation or enlargement of the adenoids causing obstruction to the nasopharyngeal airway.

1.  **Physiological Hypertrophy:** Natural growth peak at 3–7 years.
2.  **Infection (Recurrent URI):**
    *   **Viral:** [[Rhinovirus]], Adenovirus, Influenza.
    *   **Bacterial:** *Haemophilus influenzae*, Group A Beta-hemolytic *Streptococcus*, *Moraxella catarrhalis*, *Staphylococcus aureus*.
    *   The adenoid acts as a reservoir for pathogenic bacteria (biofilms), leading to recurrent ear and sinus infections.
3.  **Allergy:** Chronic allergic rhinitis contributes to enlargement.
4.  **Environment:** Second-hand smoke and pollution.

### Clinical Features
Symptoms depend on the size of the adenoid mass relative to the nasopharyngeal space.

#### 1. Nasal Symptoms
*   **Nasal Obstruction:** Commonest symptom. Leads to mouth breathing and difficulty suckling in infants (failure to thrive).
*   **Nasal Discharge:** Due to choanal obstruction preventing drainage; child often has a "wet bubbly nose".
*   **Sinusitis:** Chronic [[maxillary sinusitis]] due to persistent stasis.
*   **Epistaxis:** Occurs when acutely inflamed.
*   **Voice Change:** **Rhinolalia Clausa** (hyponasal voice/lack of nasal resonance) due to nasopharyngeal obstruction.

#### 2. Aural Symptoms (Ear)
*   **Eustachian Tube Dysfunction:** Adenoid mass blocks the [[Eustachian tube]] cushion (Torus tubarius).
*   **Serous Otitis Media (Glue Ear):** Fluctuating conductive hearing loss. **Most common cause of bilateral conductive hearing loss in children**.
*   **Recurrent Acute Otitis Media (AOM):** Due to ascending infection.

#### 3. General Symptoms
*   **Adenoid Facies:** Characteristic facial appearance due to long-standing nasal obstruction.
*   **Sleep Apnea (OSA):** Loud snoring, restless sleep, apnea spells, enuresis, and daytime somnolence.
*   **Pulmonary Hypertension (Cor Pulmonale):** Long-standing severe obstruction can lead to chronic hypoxia and right-sided heart failure (rare now).
*   **Aprosexia:** Lack of concentration due to hearing loss and sleep disturbance.

> Adenoid Facies**
*(Draw a face with the following features)*
*   Elongated face
*   Open mouth (Mouth breathing)
*   Pinched nostrils / Disuse atrophy of alae nasi
*   Short, hitched-up upper lip
*   Prominent and crowded upper teeth
*   High arched palate
*   Dull expression / Obliterated nasolabial folds

**Mnemonic for Adenoid Facies:** **"FACE"**
*   **F**ace elongated
*   **A**rched palate (High)
*   **C**rowded teeth
*   **E**xpression dull (mouth open)

### Diagnosis and Investigations

1.  **Clinical Examination:**
    *   **Cold Spatula Test:** Reduced misting on the affected side (if unilateral) or both.
    *   **Posterior Rhinoscopy:** Difficult in children; shows mass at the roof of the nasopharynx.
    *   **Otoscopy:** Retracted tympanic membrane or fluid levels ([[Serous Otitis Media]]).

2.  **Diagnostic Nasal Endoscopy (DNE):**
    *   **Gold Standard.** Allows direct visualization and grading of obstruction.
    *   **Grading (Clemens/Endoscopic):**
        *   **Grade I:** < 1/3 obstruction of choana.
        *   **Grade II:** 1/3 to 2/3 obstruction.
        *   **Grade III:** 2/3 to nearly complete obstruction.
        *   **Grade IV:** Complete choana obstruction.

3.  **Radiology:**
    *   **X-ray Nasopharynx (Lateral View):** Soft tissue exposure. Shows soft tissue mass in the posterior wall compromising the air column.
    *   **Fujioka Method:** A/N Ratio (Adenoid/Nasopharynx distance). Ratio > 0.75 indicates significant hypertrophy.

**Clinical Implication:** Always rule out **Antrochoanal Polyp** in children. On X-ray, AC polyp shows a crescent of air behind the mass (**Dodd's Sign**), whereas adenoids arise from the posterior wall and do not show this air column.

### Management

#### Medical Management
Indicated for mild symptoms or acute infection.
*   **Antibiotics:** For acute adenoiditis (e.g., Amoxicillin-Clavulanate).
*   **Nasal Steroid Sprays:** Can reduce adenoid size and improve symptoms (e.g., Mometasone).
*   **Decongestants/Antihistamines:** If an allergic component is present.
*   **Breathing exercises.**

#### Surgical Management: Adenoidectomy
Removal of the adenoid tissue. Usually performed under General Anesthesia with oral endotracheal intubation.

**Indications for [[Adenoidectomy]]:**
1.  **Obstruction:** [[Obstructive sleep apnea]] (OSA), cor pulmonale, severe snoring, adenoid facies.
2.  **Infection:** Recurrent rhinosinusitis not responding to medical therapy.
3.  **Ear Disease:** Chronic [[Otitis Media with Effusion]] (OME) > 3 months, Recurrent AOM (associated with grommet insertion).
4.  **Dental:** Dental malocclusion (prevention of recurrence after orthodontic treatment).

**Contraindications:**
1.  **Cleft Palate (Overt or Submucous):** Removal causes **Velopharyngeal Insufficiency** (VPI) leading to hypernasal speech (Rhinolalia Aperta) and nasal regurgitation.
    *   *Always palpate the palate for a notch or look for a bifid uvula before surgery.*
2.  **Acute Infection:** Risk of hemorrhage.
3.  **Bleeding Disorders.**

**Surgical Techniques:**
*   **Conventional:** Curettage using St. Clair Thomson curette (blind procedure).
*   **Endoscopic:**
    *   **Microdebrider:** Precise, suction-assisted shaving of tissue.
    *   **Coblation:** Radiofrequency ablation (less heat, less pain).
    *   **Suction Diathermy.**

**Complications of Adenoidectomy:**
*   **Hemorrhage:** Primary or Reactionary. Use postnasal pack if severe.
*   **Injury to Eustachian Tube:** Can lead to stenosis or OM.
*   **Grisel’s Syndrome:** Inflammatory subluxation of the **Atlanto-axial joint**. Patient presents with painful torticollis and fever post-op. Treatment: antibiotics and cervical immobilization.
*   **Velopharyngeal Insufficiency (VPI):** Hypernasality (Rhinolalia Aperta).
*   **Recurrence:** If tissue is left behind.
