# [[DISASTER MANAGEMENT]] > Triage

### Definition and Concept
The word **Triage** is derived from the French word *"Trier"*, which means to sort, select, or categorize. In the context of [[Disaster Management]], it is defined as the process of rapidly classifying the injured on the basis of the **severity of their injuries** and the **likelihood of their survival** with prompt medical intervention.

### Key Principles
*   **Goal:** To provide the **maximum benefit to the greatest number** of injured people in a mass emergency situation.
*   **Rule of Thumb:** The principle of "First come, first treated" is **NOT** followed in mass emergencies.
*   **Basis:** Priorities are established based on urgency and the victim's potential for survival. Patients requiring a great deal of attention with questionable benefit have the *lowest* priority.

### The Triage System (Color Coding)
The most common classification uses an internationally accepted **four-color code system**. This is essential for determining treatment order and transportation priority.

| Color Code | Priority Category | Description/Indication | Action Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RED** | **Highest Priority** | Critically ill but salvageable. Victims need immediate resuscitation or limb/life-saving surgery. | Immediate treatment/transfer (within 6 hours). |
| **YELLOW** | **High/Medium Priority** | Severely injured but stable. Can wait for a short time without threat to life or limb. | Possible resuscitation/surgery in next 24 hours. |
| **GREEN** | **Low Priority** | **Ambulatory patients** (Walking wounded). Minor injuries. | Can wait or be treated at home/on-site. |
| **BLACK** | **Least Priority** | Dead or **Moribund** (dying/survival unlikely even with therapy). | Palliative care or taken to mortuary. |

### Types of Triage
1.  **Simple Triage (S.T.A.R.T):**
    *   Stands for **Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment**.
    *   Used at the scene of mass casualty before transportation is available.
    *   Can be performed by **lightly-trained lay personnel** or emergency staff.
    *   It does *not* supersede medical instruction but sorts patients into critical vs. less serious categories.

2.  **Reverse Triage:**
    *   Used in specific scenarios like war or extreme resource limitation.
    *   The **less wounded** are treated in preference to the severely wounded to return soldiers to combat or conserve scarce resources for those most likely to survive.

### The Process at the Disaster Site
Triage is an ongoing process starting at the site and continuing until hospital admission.

1.  **Triage Sieve:** A quick survey to separate the dead and the "walking wounded" from the rest of the injured.
2.  **Triage Sort:** Assessment of the remaining casualties to allocate them into Red or Yellow categories.
3.  **Tagging:** All patients are identified with **Triage Cards/Tags**. These labels must be easily visible and contain:
    *   Identification (Name, Age, Place of origin).
    *   Triage Category (Color).
    *   Diagnosis and initial treatment.
4.  **Triage Area/Victim Collection Center:** A designated area near the disaster site where victims are stabilized (**Airway, Bleeding, Circulation**) before transport.

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Mobile Units:** In large disasters with long distances to hospitals, mobile units may act as rapid treatment centers at the site.
*   **Medical Coordinator:** A physician or experienced nurse/paramedic should serve as the Triage Officer to assign priorities and coordinate with transportation.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Victims who require a disproportionate amount of care with poor prognosis (e.g., massive head trauma with exposed brain) may be tagged Black (moribund) to save supplies for those with a chance of survival.

### Mnemonics
To remember the priority order and colors: **"Run You Green Boy"**
*   **R**un = **R**ed (Immediate/High)
*   **Y**ou = **Y**ellow (Urgent/Medium)
*   **G**reen = **G**reen (Ambulatory/Low)
*   **B**oy = **B**lack (Dead/Moribund)
