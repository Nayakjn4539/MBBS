# [[Nutrition And Health]] > Vitamins (Fat Soluble - A, D, E, K)

### Vitamins (Fat Soluble - A, D, E, K)

Vitamins are organic compounds required by the body in very small amounts (micronutrients) for growth and maintenance of good health. They do not yield energy but enable the body to use other nutrients. They are broadly classified into **Fat Soluble** (A, D, E, K) and **Water Soluble** (B group and C).

### 1. Vitamin A (Retinol)

**[[Vitamin A]]** is a specific dietary constituent essential for normal vision and epithelial tissue maintenance.

#### Forms and Sources
*   **Retinol (Pre-formed):** Found in animal foods.
    *   *Sources:* Liver, eggs, butter, cheese, whole milk, fish and meat. **[[Fish liver oils]]** (Halibut, Cod, Shark) are the richest natural sources.
*   **Beta-Carotene (Pro-vitamin):** Found in plant foods; converted to retinol in the intestinal wall.
    *   *Sources:* Green leafy vegetables (Spinach, Amaranths), yellow/orange fruits and vegetables (Papaya, Mango, Pumpkin, Carrots).
*   **Fortified Foods:** Vanaspati, milk.

#### Functions
1.  **Vision:** Essential for dark adaptation and production of retinal pigments (Rhodopsin).
2.  **Epithelial Integrity:** Maintains lining of eyes, respiratory, urinary, and intestinal tracts.
3.  **Growth:** Supports skeletal growth.
4.  **Immunity:** Known as the **"Anti-infective vitamin"**; deficiency increases susceptibility to infections.

#### Deficiency: [[Xerophthalmia]]
Deficiency leads to a spectrum of ocular manifestations known as Xerophthalmia.

| WHO Classification | Stage/Sign | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **XN** | **Night Blindness** | First clinical **symptom**. Inability to see in dim light. |
| **X1A** | **Conjunctival Xerosis** | First clinical **sign**. Conjunctiva becomes dry, dull, non-wettable. |
| **X1B** | **Bitot’s Spots** | Triangular, pearly-white, foamy spots on bulbar conjunctiva (temporal side). Epidemiological marker of deficiency. |
| **X2** | **Corneal Xerosis** | Cornea becomes dull, dry, and opaque. |
| **X3A** | **Corneal Ulceration** | Ulceration involving <1/3 of cornea. |
| **X3B** | **Keratomalacia** | Liquefaction of cornea. **Medical Emergency**. Leads to blindness. |
| **XS** | **Corneal Scar** | Healed sequel of ulceration. |
| **XF** | **Xerophthalmic Fundus** | Fundus changes. |

*   **Extra-ocular signs:** Follicular hyperkeratosis (Phrynoderma/Toad skin), growth retardation.

#### Prevention and Control (National Immunization Schedule)
*   **First Dose:** 1 Lakh IU (1 ml) at 9 months with Measles vaccine.
*   **Subsequent Doses:** 2 Lakh IU (2 ml) every 6 months until 5 years of age.
*   **Total Doses:** 9 doses.
*   **Total Quantity:** 17 Lakh IU.

#### Treatment of Deficiency
*   **Immediate:** 200,000 IU Vitamin A orally (110 mg retinol palmitate).
*   **Follow-up:** Repeat dose the next day.
*   **Recovery:** Third dose after 4 weeks.
*   *Note:* Infants <6 months get 50,000 IU; 6-12 months get 100,000 IU.

> **Mnemonic for Vitamin A Deficiency:** **N**ight **C**ats **B**ite **C**orn **K**ernels
> *   **N** - Night blindness
> *   **C** - Conjunctival Xerosis
> *   **B** - Bitot's Spots
> *   **C** - Corneal Xerosis
> *   **K** - Keratomalacia

### 2. Vitamin D (Calciferol)

Known as the **"Sunshin Vitamin"**, it acts more like a hormone than a vitamin.

#### Forms
*   **Vitamin D2 (Ergocalciferol):** Plant origin/irradiation of ergosterol.
*   **Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol):** Animal origin/sunlight.

#### Synthesis and Metabolism
1.  **Skin:** 7-dehydrocholesterol converted to Cholecalciferol by UV rays (Sunlight).
2.  **Liver:** Converted to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-HCC).
3.  **Kidney:** Converted to **1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25-DHCC)** – the biologically active form.

#### Functions
*   **Intestine:** Promotes absorption of Calcium and Phosphorus.
*   **Bone:** Essential for mineralization.
*   **Kidney:** Increases tubular reabsorption of phosphate.

#### Sources
*   **Sunlight:** Primary source (5 minutes/day exposure is often sufficient).
*   **Diet:** Fish liver oils (Richest), egg yolk, butter, cheese, milk.

#### Deficiency Diseases
1.  **[[Rickets]] (Children):**
    *   Reduced calcification of growing bones.
    *   **Clinical Features:** Growth failure, muscular hypotonia, bony deformities (curved legs, pigeon chest, **Rickety Rosary**, Harrison’s sulcus), delayed teething.
    *   *Biochemical:* Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase.
2.  **[[Osteomalacia]] (Adults):**
    *   Softening of bones, occurring mainly in women during pregnancy/lactation.

#### Toxicity (Hypervitaminosis D)
*   Nausea, vomiting, thirst, hypercalcemia, and metastatic calcification of tissues (kidney damage).

### 3. Vitamin E (Tocopherol)

#### Functions
*   Potent **[[Antioxidant]]**: Prevents oxidation of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA) in cell membranes.
*   Maintains cell membrane integrity.
*   Role in reproduction (anti-sterility factor in animals).

#### Sources
*   **Vegetable oils** (Wheat germ oil, cotton seed oil, sunflower oil), nuts, whole grains.
*   Foods rich in PUFA are generally rich in Vitamin E.

#### Deficiency
*   Rare in humans.
*   May cause **hemolytic anemia** in premature infants.
*   Associated with phrynoderma and neurological dysfunction in severe malabsorption.

### 4. Vitamin K

The "Coagulation" Vitamin (from German *Koagulation*).

#### Forms
*   **K1 (Phylloquinone):** Plants (Green leafy vegetables).
*   **K2 (Menaquinone):** Synthesized by intestinal bacteria.

#### Functions
*   Essential cofactor for the synthesis of **[[Clotting Factors]]**:
    *   Factor II (Prothrombin)
    *   Factor VII
    *   Factor IX
    *   Factor X
*   Stimulates production of these factors in the liver.

#### Sources
*   **Diet:** Fresh green vegetables (Spinach, Cabbage), cow's milk (richer than human milk).
*   **Endogenous:** Synthesis by gut flora.

#### Deficiency
*   **Manifestation:** Prolonged prothrombin time, bleeding tendencies (hemorrhage).
*   **Newborns:** High risk due to sterile gut (no bacteria), poor placental transfer, and low content in breast milk. causes **Hemorrhagic Disease of the Newborn**.

#### Clinical Relevance: Prophylaxis
*   **Newborns:** Single IM dose of Vitamin K (0.5 mg - 1.0 mg) is given at birth to prevent hemorrhagic disease.
