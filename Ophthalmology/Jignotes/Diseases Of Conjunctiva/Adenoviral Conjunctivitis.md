# [[Diseases Of Conjunctiva]] > Adenoviral Conjunctivitis

### Adenoviral Conjunctivitis

**Adenoviral conjunctivitis** is the most common cause of viral conjunctivitis, characterized by a follicular reaction. It is highly contagious and often occurs in epidemics. The causative agent is the [[Adenovirus]], a non-enveloped double-stranded DNA virus.

#### Classification and Etiology

The condition typically presents in two major clinical forms based on the serotype involved:

**1. Pharyngoconjunctival Fever (PCF)**
*   **Serotypes:** Typically caused by serotypes **3, 4, and 7**.
*   **Transmission:** Spread through droplets (respiratory) and is commonly associated with **swimming pools** ("Swimming pool conjunctivitis").
*   **Target Group:** primarily affects [[Children]].

**2. Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis (EKC)**
*   **Serotypes:** Caused by serotypes **8, 19, and 37**.
*   **Transmission:** Highly contagious; spread via hand-to-eye contact, contaminated instruments (e.g., [[Tonometers]]), and fomites.
*   **Severity:** More severe than PCF, with significant corneal involvement.

### Clinical Features

**Symptoms:**
*   **Onset:** Sudden onset of redness, often unilateral initially, becoming bilateral within days.
*   **Sensation:** Foreign body sensation, burning, and grittiness.
*   **Discharge:** Watery or serous discharge. If secondary bacterial infection occurs, it may become mucopurulent.
*   **Systemic:** PCF is characterized by the triad of **Pharyngitis (sore throat) + Fever + Conjunctivitis**.

**Signs:**
*   **Conjunctiva:**
    *   **Hyperemia:** Marked congestion.
    *   **Follicles:** Multiple [[Follicles]] are seen, predominantly in the **lower fornix** and lower palpebral conjunctiva.
    *   **Chemosis:** Conjunctival edema/swelling.
    *   **Hemorrhages:** [[Petechial hemorrhages]] or subconjunctival hemorrhages may be seen (especially in severe cases).
    *   **Pseudomembranes:** In severe EKC, fibrin-rich exudates may form [[Pseudomembranes]] or true membranes on the tarsal conjunctiva.
*   **Lymph Nodes:** Tender **Preauricular Lymphadenopathy** is a hallmark sign.

### Corneal Involvement (Keratitis)

Corneal involvement is significantly more common and severe in [[Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis]] (EKC) compared to PCF. The corneal lesions evolve through specific stages:

1.  **Epithelial Microcysts:** Early stage showing diffuse fine non-staining lesions.
2.  **Superficial Punctate Keratitis (SPK):** Appears roughly 7–10 days after onset. These are epithelial lesions caused by active viral replication.
3.  **Subepithelial Infiltrates (SEIs):**
    *   Also known as **Nummular Keratitis**.
    *   Appear as discrete, round, focal white opacities located in the anterior stroma beneath Bowman's membrane.
    *   **Pathogenesis:** These are immune-mediated (antigen-antibody reaction) responses to viral antigens, not active viral replication.
    *   **Clinical Course:** These can persist for months to years, potentially causing glare and reduced vision.

### Comparison: PCF vs. EKC

| Feature | Pharyngoconjunctival Fever (PCF) | Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Serotypes** | 3, 4, 7 | 8, 19, 37 |
| **Systemic Signs** | Fever, Pharyngitis | Usually absent |
| **Corneal Involvement** | Rare (30%) and mild | Common (80%) and severe (SEIs) |
| **Severity** | Mild to Moderate | Severe |
| **Transmission** | Droplets, Swimming pools | Fomites, Medical instruments |

**Mnemonic for Serotypes:**
*   **PCF:** **3** + **4** = **7** (Serotypes 3, 4, 7).
*   **EKC:** **E**ight **K**ills **C**ornea (Serotype 8 is classic for EKC).

### Diagnosis

*   **Clinical:** Based on the presence of follicles, preauricular lymphadenopathy, and history of contact/epidemic.
*   **Cytology:** Giemsa staining of conjunctival scrapings shows **lymphocytes** and **monocytes** (mononuclear cells).
*   **PCR:** Polymerase Chain Reaction is sensitive for detecting viral DNA.
*   **Immunochromatography:** Rapid point-of-care tests (RPA-PCR) can detect adenoviral antigens in tears.

### Management

**General Measures:**
*   **Self-limiting:** The condition is usually self-limiting and resolves in 2–3 weeks.
*   **Hygiene:** Strict hand hygiene and isolation to prevent spread (no sharing towels, separate eye drops).
*   **Supportive Therapy:** Cold compresses, artificial tears/lubricants to relieve irritation.

**Pharmacological Treatment:**
*   **Antibiotics:** Topical antibiotics are **not** effective against viruses but may be used to prevent secondary bacterial infection.
*   **Antivirals:** Specific antivirals like Acyclovir are **not effective** against Adenovirus. Cidofovir has shown some efficacy but is not routinely used.
*   **Betadine:** 5% Povidone-Iodine instillation may reduce viral load.

**Role of Steroids:**
*   **Topical Steroids:** Generally **contraindicated** in the acute infectious phase as they prolong viral replication and infectivity.
*   **Indications for Steroids:**
    1.  Severe **pseudomembranes** (to prevent symblepharon).
    2.  Vision-threatening **subepithelial infiltrates** (SEIs) causing significant glare or visual loss (used with caution and tapered slowly).

### Clinical Implication:
**Pseudomembranes** must be peeled off mechanically to prevent symblepharon formation. If the membrane bleeds on removal, it is a true membrane; if not, it is a pseudomembrane (Adenovirus causes pseudomembranes).
