# [[Pharynx]] > Tumors of Oropharynx

# Tumors of Oropharynx

The oropharynx extends from the level of the hard palate superiorly to the level of the hyoid bone inferiorly. Tumors in this region are complex due to their impact on swallowing, speech, and respiration.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a sagittal section of the head and neck highlighting the boundaries of the oropharynx: Superiorly (Soft palate), Inferiorly (Hyoid bone/Tip of epiglottis), Anteriorly (Oropharyngeal isthmus/Anterior pillars/Base of tongue), Posteriorly (Posterior pharyngeal wall).

## Surgical Anatomy & Subsites
The oropharynx consists of four main subsites:
1.  **Lateral Wall:** Includes the [[palatine tonsils]], tonsillar fossa, and faucial pillars (anterior and posterior).
2.  **Posterior Pharyngeal Wall:** Extends from the level of the hard palate to the hyoid bone.
3.  **Superior Wall:** Inferior surface of the [[soft palate]] and uvula.
4.  **Anterior Wall:** [[Base of tongue]] (posterior 1/3rd) and vallecula.

**Nerve Supply:** The sensory nerve supply is primarily by the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] (CN IX). This explains the referred otalgia (ear pain) via Jacobson's nerve in oropharyngeal malignancies.

## Benign Tumors of Oropharynx
Benign tumors are relatively rare compared to malignancies.

### 1. Papilloma
*   **Nature:** Most common benign tumor. Squamous cell papilloma.
*   **Etiology:** Often associated with [[Human Papillomavirus]] (HPV) types 6 and 11.
*   **Site:** Tonsil, soft palate, faucial pillars.
*   **Appearance:** Pedunculated, warty, white/grey mass (Mulberry appearance).
*   **Treatment:** Surgical excision (Cold steel or Laser).

### 2. Hemangioma
*   **Types:** Capillary or Cavernous.
*   **Site:** Palate, tonsil, pharyngeal wall.
*   **Clinical Features:** Asymptomatic or bleeding/dysphagia.
*   **Treatment:** Observation if small. If symptomatic: Diathermy, cryotherapy, laser, or sclerosing agents.

### 3. Pleomorphic Adenoma
*   **Origin:** Minor salivary glands.
*   **Site:** Most commonly submucosal on the **soft palate** or hard palate.
*   **Features:** Firm, painless, slow-growing, encapsulated submucosal swelling.
*   **Treatment:** Wide surgical excision (to prevent recurrence).

### 4. Mucous Retention Cyst
*   **Site:** Most commonly in the [[vallecula]].
*   **Appearance:** Smooth, yellow/pale cystic swelling.
*   **Treatment:** Excision or marsupialization if causing foreign body sensation.

## Malignant Tumors of Oropharynx

### Epidemiology & Etiology
*   **Incidence:** High in India and Southeast Asia. Males > Females.
*   **Risk Factors (The 6 S's):**
    *   **S**moking (Tobacco)
    *   **S**pirits (Alcohol) - synergistic effect with tobacco.
    *   **S**pices (Chronic irritation)
    *   **S**epsis (Poor oral hygiene)
    *   **S**harp tooth (Chronic trauma)
    *   **S**yphilis (Syphilitic glossitis)
*   **Viral Etiology:** [[Human Papillomavirus]] (HPV), specifically **HPV-16**.
    *   HPV-positive tumors are seen in younger, non-smokers.
    *   They respond better to treatment and have a **better prognosis** than HPV-negative (tobacco/alcohol-related) tumors.

**Mnemonic for Etiology:** **S**moking, **S**pirits, **S**pices, **S**harp tooth, **S**epsis, **S**yphilis.

### Pathology
*   **[[Squamous Cell Carcinoma]] (SCC):** >90% of cases. Can be keratinizing or non-keratinizing.
*   **[[Lymphoma]]:** Common in the tonsil (Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma).
*   **Minor Salivary Gland Tumors:** Adenoid cystic carcinoma, Mucoepidermoid carcinoma.

### Clinical Features
*   **Early:** Often asymptomatic or mild sore throat/foreign body sensation.
*   **Late:**
    *   **Dysphagia/Odynophagia** (Painful swallowing).
    *   **Referred Otalgia:** Pain in the ear via CN IX (Tympanic branch).
    *   **Hot Potato Voice:** Due to palatal immobility or bulk.
    *   **Trismus:** Indicates infiltration into the [[medial pterygoid muscle]].
    *   **Neck Mass:** Often the presenting symptom (cystic nodal metastasis is common).
    *   **Bleeding/Halitosis.**

### Evaluation and Staging
1.  **Examination:** Inspection and **Palpation** (crucial to assess induration and base of tongue involvement).
2.  **Endoscopy:** Flexible nasopharyngoscopy to assess airway and extent.
3.  **Biopsy:** Essential for confirmation.
4.  **Imaging:**
    *   **CECT/MRI:** To assess depth, parapharyngeal extension, bone erosion (mandible), and nodal status.
    *   **PET-CT:** For unknown primary or distant metastasis.

#### TNM Staging (Simplified AJCC)
*Note: AJCC 8th edition separates staging for HPV+ (p16+) and HPV- tumors.*

| T Stage | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **T1** | Tumor ≤ 2 cm |
| **T2** | Tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm |
| **T3** | Tumor > 4 cm or extension to epiglottis |
| **T4a** | Invades larynx, deep tongue muscles, medial pterygoid, hard palate, mandible (Resectable) |
| **T4b** | Invades lateral pterygoid, pterygoid plates, lateral nasopharynx, skull base, carotid encasement (Unresectable) |

## Specific Malignancies by Site

### 1. Carcinoma of Tonsil
*   **Incidence:** Most common malignancy of the oropharynx.
*   **Pathology:** Usually SCC.
*   **Symptoms:** Sore throat, referred otalgia, trismus (if parapharyngeal spread).
*   **Signs:** Ulcerative lesion on the tonsil.
*   **Spread:**
    *   *Medial:* Soft palate.
    *   *Inferior:* Tongue base.
    *   *Lateral:* [[Parapharyngeal space]].
    *   *Lymphatic:* Very high rate (75%). Usually Jugulodigastric node (Level II).
*   **Differential Diagnosis:** **[[Tonsillar Lymphoma]]**.
    *   Lymphoma presents as a large, smooth, non-ulcerative, submucosal swelling (unilateral tonsillar hypertrophy).
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Early (T1/T2): Radiotherapy (RT) or Surgery (Transoral Laser/Robotic Surgery).
    *   Advanced (T3/T4): Chemoradiation (CRT) or Surgery + Post-op RT.

### 2. Carcinoma Base of Tongue
*   **Nature:** "Silent Area" – tumors present late.
*   **Symptoms:** Vague discomfort, otalgia, lump in neck.
*   **Examination:** Deeply infiltrative (endophytic). Best assessed by palpation (induration).
*   **Lymphatics:** Rich lymphatic network; **Bilateral** cervical lymphadenopathy is very common (70%).
*   **Prognosis:** Poor compared to tonsillar cancer.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Primary modality is often **Chemoradiation** (to preserve speech/swallowing).
    *   Surgery: Total/Partial [[Glossectomy]] (highly morbid).

### 3. Carcinoma Soft Palate
*   **Pathology:** Usually well-differentiated SCC.
*   **Appearance:** Ulcerative or superficial spreading.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Small: Excision or RT.
    *   Large: Radiotherapy (Surgery causes velopharyngeal insufficiency and nasal regurgitation).

## Management Principles

### General Protocol
*   **Multidisciplinary Approach:** Surgeon, Radiation Oncologist, Medical Oncologist, Speech Therapist.
*   **HPV Status:** p16 positive tumors are highly radiosensitive.

### Treatment by Stage
| Stage | Primary Treatment Choice | Alternative/Adjuvant |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Early (Stage I & II)** | **Single Modality:** Radiotherapy (IMRT) OR Transoral Surgery (TORS/Laser) | Surgery reserved for radio-failures or small accessible lesions. |
| **Advanced (Stage III & IV)** | **Combined Modality:** Concurrent Chemoradiation (Organ Preservation) | Surgery (Commandos op/Glossectomy) + Post-op RT for non-responders or residual disease. |

### Management of the Neck
*   **N0 Neck (No palpable nodes):** Elective treatment is mandatory due to high risk of occult metastasis (20–30%).
    *   *If Primary = RT:* Elective Neck Irradiation.
    *   *If Primary = Surgery:* Selective Neck Dissection (Levels II, III, IV).
*   **N+ Neck (Palpable nodes):**
    *   Therapeutic Neck Dissection (Radical or Modified Radical Neck Dissection).
    *   Followed by Radiotherapy.

### Newer Surgical Techniques
*   **TOLS:** Transoral Laser Microsurgery.
*   **TORS:** [[Transoral Robotic Surgery]] (Allows resection of base of tongue/tonsil tumors through the mouth without splitting the lip/mandible).
