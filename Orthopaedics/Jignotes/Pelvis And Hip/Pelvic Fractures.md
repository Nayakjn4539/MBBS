# Pelvic Fractures

[[Pelvic fractures]] are disruptions of the bony structure of the pelvis, ranging from benign avulsion fractures to life-threatening unstable ring disruptions. These injuries are often associated with high-energy trauma and carry significant mortality due to associated [[Hemorrhagic shock]] and visceral injuries.

### Relevant Anatomy and Stability
The pelvis is a ring structure composed of the [[Sacrum]] and two [[Innominate bones]] (formed by the fusion of ilium, ischium, and pubis).
*   **Stability:** The stability of the pelvic ring depends on the rigid posterior sacroiliac complex and the anterior symphysis pubis.
    *   **Posterior Stability (Crucial):** Maintained by the [[Sacroiliac joint]], [[Posterior sacroiliac ligaments]], [[Sacrotuberous ligament]], and [[Sacrospinous ligament]].
    *   **Anterior Stability:** Maintained by the [[Pubic symphysis]].
*   **Weight Bearing:** Forces are transmitted from the spine to the sacrum, through the SI joints to the acetabulum and femoral heads.

### Mechanism of Injury
Pelvic ring fractures are generally caused by high-energy trauma (e.g., Road Traffic Accidents, falls from height) or crush injuries. The direction of force determines the fracture pattern:

1.  **Anteroposterior Compression (APC):** Force applied usually from front to back. Causes the "Open Book" injury (symphysis diastasis).
2.  **Lateral Compression (LC):** Force applied from the side. Causes the ring to buckle and break (e.g., pubic rami fractures and sacral impaction).
3.  **Vertical Shear (VS):** Force applied vertically (e.g., fall from height onto one leg). Disrups both anterior and posterior complexes, causing vertical instability.

### Classification (Tile’s Classification)
This classification is based on the **stability** of the pelvic ring and is widely used for management planning.

| Type | Description | Stability | Fracture Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type A** | **Stable** | Stable | • Does not involve the pelvic ring<br>• Avulsion fractures (e.g., ASIS, Ischial tuberosity)<br>• Isolated pubic rami fractures |
| **Type B** | **Rotationally Unstable, Vertically Stable** | Partially Stable | • Posterior osteoligamentous complex is partially intact<br>• **B1:** Open Book (APC injury)<br>• **B2:** Lateral Compression (Ipsilateral)<br>• **B3:** Bilateral (Bucket handle) |
| **Type C** | **Rotationally and Vertically Unstable** | Unstable | • Complete disruption of posterior complex<br>• **C1:** Unilateral<br>• **C2:** Bilateral<br>• **C3:** Associated with [[Acetabular fracture]] |

**Young and Burgess Classification:** Focuses on the *mechanism* of injury (APC, LC, VS, Combined Mechanism) and correlates with resuscitation needs and associated injuries.

### Clinical Features
Patients usually present with a history of high-velocity trauma.

**Symptoms:**
*   Pain in the pelvic region, groin, or lower back.
*   Inability to stand or walk.
*   [[Hematuria]] (indicates urinary tract injury).

**Signs:**
*   **Look:** Deformity, rotational malalignment of lower limbs, ecchymosis (perineal, scrotal, or inguinal).
    *   **Destot’s Sign:** Hematoma in the scrotum/inguinal region.
    *   **Morel-Lavallée Lesion:** A closed degloving injury where skin shears off deep fascia, creating a cavity filled with blood/lymph.
*   **Feel:** Tenderness over the sacroiliac joint or pubic symphysis. palpable gap at the symphysis.
*   **Move:**
    *   **Pelvic Compression/Distraction Test:** Gentle compression of iliac crests may reveal abnormal movement or crepitus.
    *   *Clinical Implication:* **Do not** perform this test repeatedly or forcefully as it may dislodge clots and restart [[Hemorrhage]]. Ideally, perform only once.
*   **Specific Signs:**
    *   **Roux Sign:** Decreased distance between the greater trochanter and pubic spine.
    *   **Earle’s Sign:** Bony prominence or large hematoma felt on rectal examination.

### Associated Injuries
Pelvic fractures are rarely isolated. Mortality is often due to associated injuries rather than the fracture itself.

**1. Hemorrhage (Major Cause of Death):**
*   **Source:** [[Presacral venous plexus]] (80%), fracture surfaces (cancellous bone), or arterial injury (10-20%, usually Superior Gluteal or Internal Pudendal arteries).
*   Can lead to rapid [[Hypovolemic shock]].

**2. Urogenital Injuries:**
*   **[[Urethral Rupture]]:** Common in males (posterior urethra). Signs: Blood at meatus, high-riding prostate on PR exam.
*   **[[Bladder Rupture]]:** Usually extraperitoneal.

**3. Neurological Injuries:**
*   Injury to the [[Lumbosacral plexus]], [[Sciatic nerve]], or [[Femoral nerve]].
*   Look for foot drop (peroneal division of sciatic nerve).

**4. Visceral Injuries:**
*   Rectal tears (makes it an open fracture), vaginal tears, bowel perforation.

### Investigations

**1. Imaging**
*   **Plain X-rays (Trauma Series):**
    *   **AP View:** General overview. Look for Shenton’s line, symmetry of foramina.
    *   **Inlet View:** (Beam directed 40° caudal) Evaluates AP displacement, inward/outward rotation, and integrity of the pelvic brim.
    *   **Outlet View:** (Beam directed 40° cephalad) Evaluates vertical migration (vertical shear) and sacral fractures.
    *   **Judet Views (Oblique):** For acetabular assessment.
*   **CT Scan:** The gold standard for defining posterior arch injury and complex fracture patterns.
*   **FAST Scan:** To rule out intra-abdominal bleeding.

**2. Others**
*   **Retrograde Urethrogram (RGU):** If urethral injury is suspected (blood at meatus).
*   **Hemoglobin/Hematocrit:** Serial monitoring.

### Management

**A. Emergency Management (ATLS Protocol)**
1.  **Airway & Breathing:** Secure airway.
2.  **Circulation:**
    *   Identify shock immediately.
    *   **Pelvic Binder/Sheet Wrap:** Apply circumferential compression at the level of the **greater trochanters** (not the iliac crests) to close the pelvic volume and promote tamponade.
    *   Fluid resuscitation (Crystalloids/Blood products).
    *   **Damage Control Orthopaedics:** If hemodynamically unstable, apply an anterior [[External Fixator]] (C-clamp or monotube) in the ER/OT to stabilize the ring.
3.  **Angiography/Embolization:** If the patient remains unstable despite mechanical stabilization and fluids, suspect arterial bleed and proceed to angio-embolization.

**B. Definitive Treatment**

*   **Type A (Stable):**
    *   Conservative management.
    *   Bed rest for 3–4 weeks.
    *   Analgesics.
    *   Mobilization as pain allows.

*   **Type B (Rotationally Unstable):**
    *   **Open Book (APC):** If symphysis diastasis > 2.5 cm, anterior stabilization is required.
        *   **Method:** ORIF with plating of symphysis pubis or External Fixation.
    *   **Lateral Compression:** Often treated conservatively unless leg length discrepancy or severe deformity exists.

*   **Type C (Vertically Unstable/Floatng Pelvis):**
    *   Requires surgical stabilization.
    *   **Anterior:** Plating or External Fixator.
    *   **Posterior:** Percutaneous Iliosacral Screws or Posterior Tension Band Plating.
    *   Vertical traction may be used initially.

### Complications

**Early:**
*   [[Deep Vein Thrombosis]] (DVT) and [[Pulmonary Embolism]] (High risk).
*   Infection (Sepsis).
*   Fat Embolism Syndrome.

**Late:**
*   **Malunion:** Resulting in chronic pain, limb length discrepancy, or sitting imbalance.
*   **Non-union:** Rare.
*   **Chronic Pain:** Sacroiliac joint pain.
*   **Obstetric Difficulties:** Distortion of the pelvic ring may necessitate Cesarean section in future.
*   **Sexual Dysfunction:** Due to neurovascular injury.
