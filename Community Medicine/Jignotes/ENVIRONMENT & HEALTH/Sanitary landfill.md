### Sanitary Landfill (Controlled Tipping)

**Sanitary Landfill**, also known as [[Controlled Tipping]], is considered the most satisfactory method of refuse disposal where suitable land is available. It differs from ordinary dumping because the refuse is not left open but is covered with earth at the end of each working day.

#### **Definition**
It is a method of disposing of refuse on land without creating nuisances or hazards to public health or safety, by utilizing the principles of engineering to confine the refuse to the smallest practical area, to reduce it to the smallest practical volume, and to cover it with a layer of earth at the conclusion of each day's operation.

#### **Methods of Operation**
The choice of method depends on the topography of the land available.

| Method | Indications | Procedure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trench Method** | Used where **level ground** is available. | A long trench is dug (2–3 m deep, 4–12 m wide). Refuse is compacted and covered with excavated earth. |
| **Ramp Method** | Used where the terrain is **moderately sloping**. | Some excavation is done to secure covering material. |
| **Area Method** | Used for filling **land depressions**, disused quarries, and clay pits. | Refuse is deposited, packed, and consolidated in uniform layers (up to 2–2.5 m deep). Each layer is sealed with a mud cover at least 30 cm thick. |

#### **Changes in Buried Refuse**
Once the refuse is buried, chemical, bacteriological, and physical changes occur:
1.  **Temperature Rise:** The temperature of the mass rises to over **60°C within 7 days**.
    *   *Significance:* This heat kills [[pathogens]], eggs, and larvae of flies, and hastens decomposition.
2.  **Cooling:** The temperature takes about 2–3 weeks to cool down.
3.  **Decomposition:**
    *   Organic matter undergoes **anaerobic decomposition**.
    *   It normally takes **4 to 6 months** for complete decomposition into an innocuous mass.
    *   Gases like Methane, Ammonia, CO₂, and H₂ are produced.

#### **Advantages**
*   **Health Safety:** Prevents breeding of [[flies]] and rodents.
*   **Nuisance Control:** Suppresses bad smells and dust (due to the earth seal).
*   **Land Reclamation:** Useful for reclaiming low-lying land, which can later be used for parks, gardens, or cultivation.
*   **Efficiency:** It is simple and effective if suitable land is available.

#### **Pre-requisites and Precautions**
*   **Placement:** Refuse should **not** be tipped into water sources, as it creates odors due to decomposition.
*   **Compaction:** Adequate compaction and covering with earth (at least **30 cm**) is essential.
*   **Mechanization:** Use of bulldozers facilitates spreading, compacting, and covering.
*   **Modified Sanitary Landfill:** In this variation, compaction and covering are done once or twice a week rather than daily.

#### **Clinical & Public Health Relevance**
*   **Vector Control:** By covering waste daily, the life cycle of flies and mosquitoes is disrupted, preventing diseases like Typhoid, Cholera, and Dengue.
*   **Leachate:** A potential hazard is the formation of **leachate** (liquid residue), which can seep into and contaminate [[groundwater]] if the landfill is not properly lined or sited.
