# Anatomy and Physiology of the Retina

The [[retina]] is the innermost, thin, transparent, neurosensory tunic of the eyeball responsible for converting light energy into neural signals. It extends from the [[optic disc]] posteriorly to the [[ora serrata]] anteriorly.

### Gross Anatomy and Dimensions

*   **Surface Area:** Approximately 266 mm².
*   **Thickness:**
    *   **Thickest:** Peripapillary region (near optic disc) ~ 0.56 mm.
    *   **Thinnest:** At the [[ora serrata]] ~ 0.1 mm and the [[foveola]] ~ 0.13 mm.
    *   **Posterior pole:** ~ 0.5 mm.
    *   **Equator:** ~ 0.2 mm.
*   **Color:** Purplish-red in the living eye due to visual purple ([[rhodopsin]]) in rods and the underlying vascular [[choroid]].

### Major Landmarks of the Fundus

#### 1. Optic Disc (Optic Nerve Head)
*   **Location:** 3-4 mm nasal to the fovea.
*   **Shape:** Vertically oval, pink-colored well-defined area.
*   **Dimensions:** Approximately 1.5 mm in diameter.
*   **Structure:**
    *   **Physiological Cup:** A central depression where the [[central retinal artery]] and vein emerge.
    *   **Neuroretinal Rim (NRR):** The tissue between the cup and disc margin.
*   **Function:** Represents the exit point of nerve fibers (1.0–1.2 million axons).
*   **Clinical Significance:** It lacks photoreceptors, creating the **physiological blind spot** of Mariotte in the visual field.

#### 2. Macula Lutea (Yellow Spot)
*   **Location:** At the posterior pole, temporal to the optic disc.
*   **Diameter:** Approx 5.5 mm (corresponds to 15–20° of the visual field).
*   **Characteristics:** Darker than surrounding fundus due to xanthophyll pigment. Responsible for central, photopic (daylight), and color vision.

#### 3. Fovea Centralis
*   **Location:** Central depressed part of the macula.
*   **Diameter:** 1.5 mm (approx 1 Disc Diameter).
*   **Histology:** Contains **only cones** (no rods); inner retinal layers are displaced laterally to allow light to reach photoreceptors directly.
*   **Function:** Area of highest visual acuity and discriminatory vision.

#### 4. Foveola and Umbo
*   **Foveola:** The central floor of the fovea (0.35 mm diameter). Contains the densest packing of cones.
*   **Umbo:** A tiny depression in the center of the foveola, seen as a shining **foveal reflex** during ophthalmoscopy.

#### 5. Foveal Avascular Zone (FAZ)
*   An area approx 0.4–0.8 mm in diameter centered on the foveola that lacks retinal capillaries. Dependence on the choroid for nutrition makes it susceptible to ischemia.

#### 6. Ora Serrata
*   The serrated anterior peripheral termination of the retina where it meets the [[ciliary body]] (pars plana).
*   **Clinical Implication:** It is a site of firm attachment between the retina and vitreous base; retinal dialysis (disinsertion) can occur here.

### Microscopic Anatomy: Layers of the Retina

The retina consists of **10 layers**. Light passes through the inner layers to reach the photoreceptors (inverted retina). The layers from **outer (choroidal side)** to **inner (vitreous side)** are:

| Layer | Description & Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. [[Retinal Pigment Epithelium]] (RPE)** | Single layer of hexagonal, pigmented cells firmly attached to [[Bruch's membrane]]. Functions: Vitamin A metabolism, phagocytosis of photoreceptor discs, absorption of scattered light, and forming the **Outer Blood-Retinal Barrier**. |
| **2. Layer of Rods and Cones** | Contains the outer and inner segments of photoreceptors. **Rods** (120 million) for scotopic/peripheral vision; **Cones** (6.5 million) for photopic/color vision. |
| **3. [[External Limiting Membrane]] (ELM)** | Not a true membrane; formed by zonula adherens junctions between photoreceptors and **Muller cells** (supportive glial cells). |
| **4. [[Outer Nuclear Layer]] (ONL)** | Contains the cell bodies (nuclei) of rods and cones. |
| **5. [[Outer Plexiform Layer]] (OPL)** | Synaptic layer between photoreceptors and bipolar/horizontal cells. In the macula, this is known as **Henle's layer** (oblique fibers). |
| **6. [[Inner Nuclear Layer]] (INL)** | Contains nuclei of **Bipolar cells** (1st order neurons), Horizontal cells, Amacrine cells, and Muller cells. |
| **7. [[Inner Plexiform Layer]] (IPL)** | Synaptic layer between bipolar, amacrine, and ganglion cells. |
| **8. [[Ganglion Cell Layer]] (GCL)** | Contains nuclei of **Ganglion cells** (2nd order neurons). Thickest at the macula (multi-layered), absent at the foveola. |
| **9. [[Nerve Fiber Layer]] (NFL)** | Axons of ganglion cells that converge to form the [[optic nerve]]. |
| **10. [[Internal Limiting Membrane]] (ILM)** | Innermost layer separating retina from vitreous; formed by basement membrane of Muller cells. |

**Mnemonic for Layers (Inner to Outer):** **I**n **N**ew **G**enerations, **I**t **I**s **O**nly **O**phthalmologists **E**xamining **P**atients.
*(ILM, NFL, GCL, IPL, INL, OPL, ONL, ELM, Photoreceptors, RPE)*

**Clinical Implication:** 
*   **Subretinal Space:** A potential space between the Neurosensory Retina (layers 2-10) and the RPE. Fluid accumulation here leads to **[[Retinal Detachment]]**.
*   **Blood-Retinal Barrier (BRB):**
    *   **Inner BRB:** Tight junctions of retinal capillary endothelium.
    *   **Outer BRB:** Tight junctions (zonula occludens) of RPE cells.

### Vascular Supply of the Retina

The retina has a dual blood supply:

1.  **Outer 4 Layers (Photoreceptors/RPE):** Avascular; nourished by the **choriocapillaris** of the choroid (via diffusion across Bruch's membrane).
2.  **Inner 6 Layers:** Supplied by the **[[Central Retinal Artery]] (CRA)**, a branch of the ophthalmic artery.
3.  **Fovea:** Avascular; supplied entirely by the choriocapillaris.

**Anatomical Variation:**
*   **[[Cilioretinal Artery]]:** Present in 15–20% of individuals. It is a branch of the short posterior ciliary arteries (choroidal system) but supplies the inner retina at the macula.
*   **Clinical Significance:** In cases of CRA occlusion, if a cilioretinal artery is present, central vision may be preserved ("macular sparing").

### Physiology of Vision

#### 1. Phototransduction
The process of converting light energy into electrical signals.
*   **Photopigments:**
    *   **Rods:** Contain **[[Rhodopsin]]** (Visual Purple). Peak sensitivity ~500 nm (blue-green). Responsible for night (scotopic) vision.
    *   **Cones:** Contain **Photopsins** (Iodopsin). Three types: Erythrolabe (Red/L-cones), Chlorolabe (Green/M-cones), Cyanolabe (Blue/S-cones). Responsible for color and fine vision.

#### 2. The Visual Cycle (Wald's Cycle)
Occurs between photoreceptors and RPE.
1.  **Activation:** Light hits Rhodopsin $\rightarrow$ Isomerization of **11-cis retinal** to **all-trans retinal** (Bleaching).
2.  **Cascade:** This conformational change activates **Transducin** (G-protein) $\rightarrow$ Activates Phosphodiesterase (PDE) $\rightarrow$ Hydrolysis of cGMP.
3.  **Result:** Low cGMP leads to **closure of Na+ channels** $\rightarrow$ **Hyperpolarization** of the photoreceptor cell (unlike most neurons which depolarize).
4.  **Signal:** Hyperpolarization stops the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter (glutamate), activating the bipolar cells.
5.  **Regeneration:** All-trans retinal is transported to RPE, converted back to 11-cis retinal (requires Vitamin A), and returned to photoreceptors to regenerate Rhodopsin.

#### 3. Neural Processing
*   **Pathway:** Photoreceptors $\rightarrow$ Bipolar Cells (1st Order) $\rightarrow$ Ganglion Cells (2nd Order) $\rightarrow$ Optic Nerve $\rightarrow$ LGN (3rd Order) $\rightarrow$ Visual Cortex.
*   **Parallel Processing:**
    *   **Magnocellular (M-cells):** Large cells, detect motion/flicker, color blind.
    *   **Parvocellular (P-cells):** Small cells, detect color/fine detail/texture.

### Clinical Implications and Pathologies

*   **[[Retinitis Pigmentosa]]:** Primary degeneration of rods (night blindness, ring scotoma) followed by cones. RPE changes lead to bony spicule pigmentation.
*   **[[Macular Degeneration]] (ARMD):** Affects the RPE and photoreceptors at the macula, leading to loss of central vision (scotoma) and metamorphopsia.
*   **[[Diabetic Retinopathy]]:** Microangiopathy affecting retinal capillaries (inner layers). Loss of pericytes leads to microaneurysms and leakage (edema/exudates).
*   **[[Cherry Red Spot]]:** Seen in CRAO and storage disorders (Tay-Sachs). The thin fovea allows the red choroid to show through the opaque/edematous surrounding retina.
*   **[[Retinal Detachment]] (Rhegmatogenous):** Fluid from liquefied vitreous passes through a retinal break into the subretinal space, separating the neurosensory retina from the RPE (disrupting nutrition to outer layers).
