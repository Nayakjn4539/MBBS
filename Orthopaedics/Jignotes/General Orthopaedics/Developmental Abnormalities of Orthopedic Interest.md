### Generalised Skeletal Dysplasias

These are generalized disorders of bone and cartilage growth, usually genetic in origin, affecting the skeleton symmetrically.

#### 1. Achondroplasia
This is the most common form of short-limb [[dwarfism]]. It is an autosomal dominant disorder, though 80% of cases arise from spontaneous new mutations. The essential defect is a failure of longitudinal growth in the cartilaginous growth plates (enchondral ossification), while intramembranous ossification (width of shaft) remains normal.

*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   **Stature:** Disproportionate dwarfism. The trunk is of normal length, but the limbs are short.
    *   **Rhizomelia:** The shortening is most marked in the proximal segments (humerus and femur).
    *   **Face/Head:** Large skull with a prominent forehead ([[frontal bossing]]) and a depressed nasal bridge (saddle nose).
    *   **Hands:** Short, stubby fingers. The middle and ring fingers are separated by a gap, giving the appearance of a **[[Trident hand]]**.
    *   **Spine:** Excessive [[lumbar lordosis]] and prominent buttocks. In infancy, a thoracolumbar kyphosis (gibbus) may be present.
    *   **Intelligence:** Usually normal.

*   **Radiological Features:**
    *   Short, thick tubular bones.
    *   **Champagne glass pelvis:** The pelvis is broad and shallow.
    *   **Bullet-nosed vertebrae:** Seen in the spine.
    *   Narrowing of the [[interpedicular distance]] in the lumbar spine (normally it widens caudally).

*   **Clinical Implications:**
    *   **Spinal Stenosis:** Due to short pedicles and narrow canal, these patients are prone to [[spinal stenosis]] and nerve root compression in adulthood.

#### 2. Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI)
Also known as "Brittle Bone Disease" or [[Fragilitas Ossium]]. It is a disorder of type I [[collagen]] synthesis (defective osteoid formation).

*   **Pathophysiology:** Defective collagen leads to fragile bones, ligamentous laxity, and thin skin.
*   **Clinical Classification (Sillence):**
    *   **Type I:** Mildest form, blue sclerae, fractures occur after walking begins.
    *   **Type II:** Lethal perinatal form; multiple fractures in utero.
    *   **Type III:** Severe progressive deformity, normal sclerae.
    *   **Type IV:** Moderate severity, normal sclerae.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Multiple Fractures:** Occur with trivial trauma. Healing occurs rapidly but often with deformity (malunion).
    *   **[[Blue Sclera]]:** Due to the thinning of the sclera allowing the choroidal pigment to show through.
    *   **Dentition:** [[Dentinogenesis imperfecta]] (discolored, brittle teeth).
    *   **Deafness:** Due to otosclerosis.
    *   **Wormian bones:** Seen in the skull sutures.

#### 3. Osteopetrosis (Marble Bone Disease)
Also known as [[Albers-Schonberg disease]]. It is characterized by increased bone density due to the failure of [[osteoclasts]] to resorb bone.

*   **Pathology:** The bone is hard, dense, but brittle (chalk-like) and fractures easily. The medullary canal is obliterated by bone.
*   **Radiological Features:**
    *   Generalized increase in bone density ("Marble bones").
    *   **[[Rugger Jersey Spine]]:** Sclerosis near the endplates of vertebrae with a relatively lucent center.
    *   **Bone-within-bone appearance** (Endobone formation).
*   **Complications:**
    *   [[Pancytopenia]]/Anemia (due to marrow obliteration).
    *   Cranial nerve palsies (optic/auditory) due to foraminal narrowing.

### Disorders of Bone Growth and Remodeling

#### 1. Hereditary Multiple Exostosis (Diaphyseal Aclasis)
An autosomal dominant condition characterized by multiple [[osteochondromas]] (cartilage-capped bony outgrowths) arising from the metaphysis.

*   **Pathology:** Defect in metaphyseal remodeling (aclases = lack of remodeling). The metaphysis is broad and trumpet-shaped.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Multiple hard, painless lumps near joints (knee, shoulder, wrist).
    *   Growth retardation and limb length discrepancy.
    *   **Madelung-like deformity:** Shortening of the ulna leads to bowing of the radius.
*   **Complication:** Malignant transformation into [[chondrosarcoma]] (risk is higher than in solitary osteochondroma, approx 1-5%).

#### 2. Fibrous Dysplasia
A developmental defect where bone is replaced by fibrous tissue and immature trabeculae due to a Gs-alpha gene mutation.

*   **Types:**
    1.  **Monostotic:** Single bone involved (most common).
    2.  **Polyostotic:** Multiple bones involved.
    3.  **[[McCune-Albright Syndrome]]:** Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia + *Café-au-lait* spots (coast of Maine/jagged borders) + Precocious puberty.
*   **Radiological Features:**
    *   **Ground-glass appearance** (hazy radiolucency).
    *   **[[Shepherd’s Crook deformity]]:** Varus deformity of the proximal femur.
*   **Clinical Implications:** Prone to pathological fractures and deformities.

#### 3. Dyschondroplasia (Ollier’s Disease)
A condition characterized by multiple [[enchondromas]] (cartilaginous tumors within the bone marrow) usually affecting one side of the body (unilateral).

*   **Clinical Features:** Shortening of the affected limb, deformities of fingers/toes.
*   **Maffucci’s Syndrome:** Dyschondroplasia associated with soft tissue [[hemangiomas]]. High risk of malignancy.

### Neurocutaneous Syndromes

#### Neurofibromatosis (Von Recklinghausen’s Disease)
A genetic disorder (NF-1) affecting bone, skin, and nerves.

*   **Diagnostic Criteria (2 or more required):**
    *   6 or more *Café-au-lait* spots (smooth "Coast of California" borders).
    *   Axillary/inguinal freckling.
    *   [[Lisch nodules]] (iris hamartomas).
    *   Neurofibromas (subcutaneous or plexiform).
    *   Optic glioma.
    *   Specific skeletal lesions.
*   **Orthopedic Manifestations:**
    *   **Kyphoscoliosis:** Often a sharp, short-segment angular curve (dystrophic scoliosis).
    *   **Congenital Pseudarthrosis of the Tibia:** Anterolateral bowing of the tibia which fractures and refuses to heal.
    *   Ribbon-like ribs.

### Regional Malformations

#### 1. Spine
*   **[[Klippel-Feil Syndrome]]:** Congenital fusion of cervical vertebrae (synostosis).
    *   *Classic Triad:* Low posterior hairline, short neck, restricted neck motion.
    *   Associated with [[Sprengel's shoulder]] (congenital elevation of the scapula).
*   **[[Spina Bifida]]:** Failure of fusion of the posterior neural arch. Ranges from Spina Bifida Occulta (tuft of hair) to Meningomyelocele (neural tissue exposed).

#### 2. Upper Limb
*   **[[Madelung’s Deformity]]:** A congenital subluxation of the wrist due to defective growth of the volar-ulnar part of the distal radial physis.
    *   *Features:* The radius bows, the ulna is prominent dorsally, and the hand is displaced palmarly and ulnarly.
*   **[[Phocomelia]]:** "Seal limbs"; hands or feet are attached close to the trunk (associated with Thalidomide toxicity).

#### 3. Lower Limb
*   **[[Coxa Vara]]:** Decrease in the neck-shaft angle of the femur (<120 degrees). Can be congenital or developmental. Leads to shortening and a Trendelenburg gait.
*   **Congenital Talipes Equino Varus ([[CTEV]]):** Clubfoot. Characterized by Equinus, Varus, Adduction, and Cavus (CAVE).
