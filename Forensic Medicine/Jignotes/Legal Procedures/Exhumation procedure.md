# [[Legal Procedures]] > Exhumation procedure

### Definition
**Exhumation** (Latin: *Ex* = out of, *humus* = ground), also known as **disinterment**, is the lawful digging out of a buried dead body from the grave for the purpose of identification or determination of the cause of death.

### Legal Provisions (In India)
*   **Authorization:** Exhumation is conducted **only** under a written order from an **Executive Magistrate** (District Magistrate/Sub-Divisional Magistrate). A police officer (even of high rank) cannot order exhumation.
*   **Section:** It is usually carried out under **Section 176(3) CrPC** (investigation into cause of death) or Section 176(4) CrPC (inquiry into death).
*   **Time Limit:** There is **no time limit** for exhumation in India. It can be ordered at any time, regardless of how long the body has been buried.
    *   *Comparison:* In France, the limit is 10 years; in Germany, 30 years.

### Indications/Objectives
**Criminal Causes:**
*   Suspicion of **homicide** (especially poisoning) after burial.
*   Suspected criminal abortion.
*   Cases of death due to criminal malpractice.
*   Disputed cause of death requiring a **[[Second Autopsy]]**.
*   Disputed identity of the deceased.

**Civil Causes:**
*   Accidental death claims (Insurance/Workmen's Compensation).
*   Claiming inheritance/survivorship.
*   Civil suits regarding identity.

### Prerequisites for Exhumation
1.  **Written Order:** From the competent Executive Magistrate.
2.  **Identification of Grave:** Positive identification of the specific burial plot using grave markers, headstones, or cemetery records is crucial to avoid disinterring the wrong body.
3.  **Supervision:** The process must be supervised by the Medical Officer and the Magistrate in the presence of a police officer.
4.  **Notice:** Wherever practicable, relatives should be informed and allowed to be present.

### The Exhumation Procedure

**1. Preparation**
*   **Timing:** The procedure should ideally commence in the **early morning** to utilize maximum daylight.
*   **Screening:** The grave site should be screened off (using shamianas or tent walls) to maintain privacy and prevent public viewing.
*   **Disinfectants:** **No disinfectants** or strong-smelling substances (like bleaching powder) should be sprinkled on the body or the surrounding earth, as they can interfere with chemical analysis.

**2. Excavation**
*   The digging should be done carefully to avoid damage to the coffin or the body (e.g., spade injuries).
*   Soil samples must be collected *during* the digging process (see below).
*   Once the coffin/body is exposed, the Magistrate and relatives must identify the coffin/remains before removal.

**3. Collection of Soil and Control Samples**
This is a critical step, especially in suspected poisoning (Heavy metals like [[Arsenic]] can leach from the soil into the body, or from the body into the soil).
*   **Quantity:** Approximately **500g (½ kg)** of earth for each sample.
*   **Locations:**
    1.  Soil form **above** the coffin/body.
    2.  Soil from **below** the coffin/body.
    3.  Soil from **each side** (left and right) of the coffin/body (in direct contact).
    4.  **Control Sample:** Soil from a distance (approx. 5-10 yards away) at the same depth where no body is buried.
*   **Additional samples:** Pieces of the coffin wood, shroud, or fluid/debris found inside the coffin.

**4. Removal and Transport**
*   The body is gently lifted. If skeletonized, care is taken to collect all small bones (hand/feet) by sifting the soil.
*   The body is transferred to the mortuary for the [[Medicolegal Autopsy]].

### Autopsy Considerations in Exhumed Bodies

**External Examination**
*   **Identification:** Rely on dental data, tattoos, scars, deformities, or personal effects (jewelry, clothes) as facial features may be bloated or skeletonized.
*   **Artifacts:** Differentiate between decomposition changes and ante-mortem injuries. Mold/fungus on the body can resemble bruises.
*   **Injuries:** Grave-diggers' shovels can cause post-mortem fractures (no vital reaction).

**Internal Examination**
*   Standard autopsy protocol is followed.
*   In advanced decomposition/skeletonization:
    *   **Bones:** Look for fractures, heavy metal deposition.
    *   **Hair and Nails:** Crucial for detecting chronic poisoning (Arsenic, Antimony, Thallium) as keratin resists putrefaction.
    *   **Viscera:** Even if organs are liquefied, the resultant sludge/debris should be collected for chemical analysis.

### Medicolegal Aspects and Toxicological Interpretation
1.  **Arsenic Poisoning:**
    *   Arsenic is virtually indestructible and can be detected in hair/bones/soil for years.
    *   **Problem:** Soil containing arsenic can contaminate the body (Post-mortem imbibition).
    *   **Solution:** Compare the concentration in the body vs. the surrounding soil. If the concentration in the body is significantly higher than the soil, it suggests poisoning. If hair/nails show arsenic, it confirms ante-mortem ingestion (as soil arsenic cannot enter the hair shaft structure post-mortem).
2.  **Alcohol/Volatile poisons:** Usually lost or unreliable due to decomposition.
3.  **Alkaloids:** Some (like Strychnine) may resist putrefaction for some time, but generally difficult to detect after long periods.
