# [[Community Ophthalmology]] > Eye Camps and Tele-ophthalmology

### Eye Camps

**Eye camps** constitute a vital strategy in developing countries to extend eye care services to rural and remote areas where permanent infrastructure is insufficient. They are instrumental in clearing the backlog of [[avoidable blindness]], particularly [[Cataract]].

#### Approaches to Eye Camps
There has been a paradigm shift in the strategy of conducting eye camps under the [[National Programme for Control of Blindness]] (NPCB).

**1. Reach-out Approach (Comprehensive Eye Care Camps)**
*   **Concept:** The medical team travels to the community to provide both screening and surgical services *on-site* (e.g., in schools or community halls).
*   **Current Status:** Generally discouraged for intraocular surgery due to higher risks of [[postoperative endophthalmitis]] and lack of sterile environments compared to fixed base hospitals.

**2. Reach-in Approach (Screening Eye Camps)**
*   **Concept:** Screening is done at the camp site, but surgery is performed at a well-equipped [[Base Hospital]].
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Screening:** Team visits rural area $\rightarrow$ identify patients with [[Cataract]] or [[Refractive errors]].
    2.  **Transport:** Patients requiring surgery are transported to the base hospital.
    3.  **Surgery:** Performed under sterile conditions with better equipment.
    4.  **Follow-up:** Patients are transported back to their homes.
*   **Current Status:** **Preferred method.** It ensures better quality of care, higher success rates, and lower complication rates.

#### Guidelines for Camp Surgeries (Govt. of India)
To ensure safety and quality, specific guidelines must be followed:
*   **Unilateral Surgery:** Both eyes should **never** be operated on at the same sitting (one go) to prevent potential bilateral blinding complications (e.g., bilateral endophthalmitis).
*   **Risk Exclusion:** Patients with poor surgical risks should **not** be operated on in camps or through camp referrals without optimization. They should be referred to tertiary centers. Exclusion criteria include:
    *   Severe/Uncontrolled [[Diabetes Mellitus]].
    *   Severe [[Hypertension]].
    *   Cardiac problems.
    *   Active infections.
*   **Documentation:** Meticulous records of patients, surgical notes, and postoperative complications must be maintained.

**Clinical Implication:** The shift from camp-based surgery to base-hospital surgery has significantly reduced the incidence of "camp-blindness" caused by mass infections in unsterile makeshift operation theaters.

### Tele-ophthalmology

**Tele-ophthalmology** utilizes telecommunication technology and the internet to provide ophthalmic health services to patients in remote locations by connecting them with specialists in tertiary centers.

#### Role in NPCB (12th Five Year Plan Initiatives)
The [[National Programme for Control of Blindness]] has integrated tele-ophthalmology to bridge the gap between the rural population and eye care specialists.

*   **Network Structure:**
    *   **Peripheral Units:** [[Vision Centres]] or Mobile Ophthalmic Units capture images (fundus photos, anterior segment photos) and patient data.
    *   **Connectivity:** Data is transmitted via internet connectivity.
    *   **Central Hubs:** Consultations are provided by ophthalmologists at Medical Colleges and [[Regional Institute of Ophthalmology]] (RIOs).

#### Applications
1.  **Diabetic Retinopathy Screening:** Fundus cameras at peripheral centers capture retinal images, which are graded by specialists remotely. Crucial for managing the emerging epidemic of [[Diabetic Retinopathy]].
2.  **Glaucoma Screening:** Assessment of [[Optic Disc]] images for cupping.
3.  **ROP Screening:** [[Retinopathy of Prematurity]] screening in neonatal care units where pediatric ophthalmologists are not physically available.
4.  **Second Opinions:** Complex cases in district hospitals can be discussed with experts in Centres of Excellence.

#### Multipurpose District Mobile Ophthalmic Units (MDMOU)
*   **Concept:** Introduced to expand coverage in remote, underserved, and hilly areas (e.g., North-East India).
*   **Function:** These mobile vans are equipped to perform screening, basic refraction, and act as a mobile node in the tele-ophthalmology network.

### Comparison of Care Delivery Models

| Feature | Eye Camps (Traditional) | Tele-ophthalmology |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Goal** | Mass screening & Cataract surgery | Diagnosis, Screening (DR/Glaucoma), Expert Consult |
| **Location** | Community/Village sites | Vision Centres/Mobile Units connected to Hospitals |
| **Main Activity** | Physical examination & Refraction | Image capture & Data transmission |
| **Specialist Presence** | Physical presence required | Remote presence (Virtual) |
| **Cost** | High (Logistics/Transport) | Low (Initial setup high, running cost low) |
| **Reach** | Intermittent (Campaign based) | Continuous/On-demand |
