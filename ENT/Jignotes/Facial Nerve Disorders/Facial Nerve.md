# [[Facial Nerve]] (CN VII): Anatomy, Course, and Physiology

The [[Facial Nerve]] is the nerve of the second [[branchial arch]]. It is a mixed nerve containing motor, sensory, and parasympathetic fibers. It has a complex course, being the most common cranial nerve to be involved in functional deficits due to its long route through a non-expandable bony canal.

### Functional Components and Nuclei

The nerve consists of four distinct functional components:

| Component | Function | Nucleus/Origin | Structures Supplied |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Special Visceral Efferent (SVE)** | Motor supply to muscles of [[2nd branchial arch]] | Motor Nucleus of VII (Pons) | Muscles of [[facial expression]], [[stapedius]], stylohyoid, posterior belly of digastric,,. |
| **General Visceral Efferent (GVE)** | Parasympathetic secretomotor | Superior Salivary Nucleus | [[Lacrimal gland]], nasal/palatal glands, submandibular and sublingual [[salivary glands]],,. |
| **Special Visceral Afferent (SVA)** | Taste sensation | Nucleus of Tractus Solitarius | Anterior 2/3 of the [[tongue]], soft and hard palate,,. |
| **General Somatic Afferent (GSA)** | Cutaneous sensation | Spinal Nucleus of V | [[Concha]], retroauricular groove, posterior wall of [[external auditory canal]],,. |

**Clinical Implication:**
*   **Supranuclear Lesion:** The upper part of the facial nucleus (supplying the forehead) receives bilateral cortical input. The lower part receives only contralateral input. Therefore, an Upper Motor Neuron (UMN) lesion spares the forehead (patient can frown), while a Lower Motor Neuron (LMN) lesion paralyzes the entire ipsilateral face,.

### Course of the Facial Nerve

The course is divided into three distinct parts: Intracranial, Intratemporal, and Extracranial.

#### 1. Intracranial Segment
*   **Origin:** The motor fibers arise from the nucleus in the pons.
*   **Course:** The fibers hook around the nucleus of the [[abducens nerve]] (VI) (forming the facial colliculus) and are joined by the sensory root ([[Nerve of Wrisberg]]),.
*   **Exit:** Leaves the brainstem at the pontomedullary junction and traverses the posterior cranial fossa to enter the [[Internal Acoustic Meatus]] (IAM),.
*   **Length:** Approximately 15–17 mm,.

**Clinical Implication:**
*   **Cerebellopontine Angle Tumors:** Lesions here (e.g., [[acoustic neuroma]]) involve the VII and VIII nerves, potentially affecting V, IX, X, and XI.

#### 2. Intratemporal Segment
This segment runs from the IAM to the [[stylomastoid foramen]] within the bony [[fallopian canal]]. It is divided into four segments:

| Segment | Length | Course and Relations | Clinical Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Meatal** | 8–10 mm | Within the [[Internal Acoustic Meatus]], anterosuperior to the [[vestibulocochlear nerve]]. Separated from the superior vestibular nerve by [[Bill's Bar]],,. | |
| **Labyrinthine** | 3–4 mm | Extends from the fundus of the meatus to the [[geniculate ganglion]]. <br> **First Genu:** The nerve turns posteriorly here,. | **Narrowest** (0.61–0.68 mm) and **Shortest** segment. Most susceptible to compression by edema (e.g., [[Bell's Palsy]]) due to lack of anastomosing arterial cascades,,. |
| **Tympanic** (Horizontal) | 11 mm | Runs from [[geniculate ganglion]] to just above the [[pyramidal eminence]]. <br> **Relations:** Lies above the [[oval window]] and below the [[lateral semicircular canal]],,. | **Dehiscence:** The bony canal is frequently dehiscent here (50% of population), predisposing the nerve to injury during surgery or infection from [[acute otitis media]],,. |
| **Mastoid** (Vertical) | 13 mm | Runs vertically from the pyramid to the [[stylomastoid foramen]]. <br> **Second Genu:** Located between the tympanic and mastoid segments,,. | Landmarks: Posterior to the pyramid and tympanic sulcus; anterior to the digastric ridge. |

**Surgical Landmarks for Intratemporal Facial Nerve:**
*   **Processus Cochleariformis:** The geniculate ganglion lies immediately superior to this bony process.
*   **Oval Window:** Nerve runs superior to it,.
*   **Lateral Semicircular Canal:** Nerve runs inferior to it.
*   **Fossa Incudis:** Nerve lies medial and inferior to the short process of the incus,.

#### 3. Extracranial Segment
*   **Exit:** The nerve exits the temporal bone via the [[stylomastoid foramen]].
*   **Course:** It turns anteriorly, passing laterally to the [[styloid process]] and enters the [[parotid gland]].
*   **Division:** Within the parotid (pes anserinus), it divides into temporofacial and cervicofacial divisions.

**Surgical Landmarks for Extracranial Facial Nerve:**
*   **Tragal Pointer:** The nerve lies approximately 1 cm deep and inferior to the tragal pointer,.
*   **Tympanomastoid Suture:** The nerve lies 6–8 mm deep to this suture line,.
*   **Posterior Belly of Digastric:** The nerve runs parallel and superior to this muscle.

### Branches of the Facial Nerve

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Branching pattern of the Facial Nerve

#### Intratemporal Branches

| Branch | Origin | Function/Supply | Clinical Consequence of Lesion |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Greater Superficial Petrosal Nerve (GSPN)** | [[Geniculate Ganglion]] | Secretomotor to [[lacrimal gland]], nasal, and palatal glands,,. | Loss of lacrimation (Dry eye). |
| **Nerve to Stapedius** | Second Genu / Vertical segment | Motor supply to [[stapedius muscle]],. | [[Hyperacusis]] (loss of stapedial reflex). |
| **Chorda Tympani** | Vertical Segment (approx. 5-6mm above stylomastoid foramen) | Taste: Anterior 2/3 of tongue. <br> Secretomotor: [[Submandibular gland]] & [[sublingual gland]],,. | Loss of taste; Reduced salivation. |
| **Sensory Auricular Branch** | Mastoid Segment | Sensation to concha, retroauricular groove, posterior meatus,. | [[Hitselberger's sign]] (anesthesia of posterior meatal wall) in Acoustic Neuroma. |

#### Extracranial Branches

1.  **Posterior Auricular Nerve:** Supplies muscles of the pinna and occipital belly of occipitofrontalis,.
2.  **Muscular Branches:** Supply [[stylohyoid]] and posterior belly of [[digastric muscle]].
3.  **Terminal Branches (Pes Anserinus):** Supply muscles of facial expression,.
    *   **T**emporal
    *   **Z**ygomatic
    *   **B**uccal
    *   **M**andibular (Marginal)
    *   **C**ervical

**Mnemonic for Terminal Branches:** **T**o **Z**anzibar **B**y **M**otor **C**ar.

### Vascular Supply

The facial nerve is supplied by an arterial plexus derived from four vessels:
1.  **Anterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (AICA):** CP angle segment.
2.  **Labyrinthine Artery:** Intrameatal segment.
3.  **Superficial Petrosal Artery:** Geniculate ganglion area (branch of middle meningeal).
4.  **Stylomastoid Artery:** Mastoid and tympanic segments (branch of posterior auricular).

### Physiology and Topodiagnostic Tests

Topodiagnostic tests help localize the level of the lesion within the temporal bone based on the branching pattern,.

| Test | Physiological Basis | Interpretation | Localization |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Schirmer Test** | Tests GSPN (lacrimation) | Reduced lacrimation on affected side | Lesion proximal to [[Geniculate Ganglion]],. |
| **Stapedial Reflex** | Tests nerve to stapedius | Absence of reflex with intact hearing | Lesion proximal to the [[stapedius]] branch,. |
| **Electrogustometry / Taste Test** | Tests [[Chorda Tympani]] | Loss of taste on anterior 2/3 of tongue | Lesion proximal to chorda tympani origin,. |
| **Submandibular Salivary Flow** | Tests [[Chorda Tympani]] | Reduced salivary flow | Lesion proximal to chorda tympani origin,. |

**Site of Lesion Summary:**
*   **Suprageniculate:** Loss of lacrimation + Loss of stapedial reflex + Loss of taste.
*   **Suprastapedial:** Normal lacrimation + Loss of reflex + Loss of taste.
*   **Infrastapedial:** Normal lacrimation + Normal reflex + Loss of taste.
*   **Infrachordal (Stylomastoid foramen):** Motor paralysis only (sparing taste, reflex, and tearing).
