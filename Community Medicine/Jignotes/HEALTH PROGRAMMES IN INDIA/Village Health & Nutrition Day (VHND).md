# [[HEALTH PROGRAMMES IN INDIA]] > Village Health & Nutrition Day (VHND).

### Village Health & Nutrition Day (VHND)

**Definition and Concept**
[[Village Health & Nutrition Day (VHND)]] is a key strategy under the [[National Health Mission (NHM)]] (formerly NRHM) to provide primary health care services at the doorstep of the community. It serves as a platform for the convergence of services provided by the Health Department and the [[Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)]] scheme. It is an important tool for community empowerment and participation at the grassroots level.

**Schedule and Venue**
*   **Frequency:** Organized at least **once in a month** in each village.
*   **Venue:** Usually held at the [[Anganwadi Centre (AWC)]] or other community-level facility platforms.
*   **Duration:** Each VHND should last for at least **4 hours** of contact time between the service providers and beneficiaries.

**Key Participants and Organizers**
The event is organized with the coordination of the "frontline worker trinity":
1.  **[[Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM)]] / [[Female Health Worker]]**
2.  **[[Anganwadi Worker (AWW)]]**
3.  **[[Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA)]]**

*Supervision:* Supported by Medical Officers, Lady Health Visitors (LHV), and PRI (Panchayati Raj Institution) members.
