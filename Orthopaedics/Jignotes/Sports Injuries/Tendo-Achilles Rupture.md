# [[Sports Injuries]] > Tendo-Achilles Rupture

### [[Tendo-Achilles Rupture]]

#### Introduction and Epidemiology
The [[Achilles Tendon]] (Tendo-Calcaneus) is the strongest and thickest tendon in the human body, formed by the confluence of the [[Gastrocnemius]] and [[Soleus]] muscles inserting into the [[Calcaneus]]. Rupture is a common sports injury, typically occurring in middle-aged individuals (30–50 years), often termed "weekend warriors."

*   **Site of Rupture:** usually occurs 2–6 cm proximal to the insertion into the [[Calcaneus]].
    *   **Why here?** This is a "watershed area" of relative avascularity (poor blood supply), making it prone to degeneration and rupture.

#### Mechanism of Injury
Rupture usually occurs in a degenerate tendon subjected to sudden stress.
*   **Push-off:** Forceful plantarflexion while the knee is extending (e.g., starting a sprint, jumping).
*   **Sudden Dorsiflexion:** Unexpected dorsiflexion of a plantarflexed foot (e.g., stepping into a hole or slipping on stairs).
*   **Direct Trauma:** Violent blow to the tendon (less common).

#### Clinical Features
*   **History:**
    *   Patient often reports a sensation of being "kicked" or "shot" in the back of the ankle.
    *   Audible "pop" or snap may be heard.
    *   Immediate pain which may subside quickly to a dull ache.
*   **Inspection:**
    *   Swelling and bruising around the ankle and foot.
    *   Loss of normal tendon contour.
*   **Palpation:**
    *   A palpable **gap** or depression is often felt at the rupture site (usually 2-5 cm above the heel).
*   **Function:**
    *   Inability to stand on tiptoes (loss of plantarflexion power).
    *   **Note:** Weak plantarflexion may still be possible due to the action of the [[Tibialis Posterior]], [[Flexor Hallucis Longus]], and [[Flexor Digitorum Longus]], which can mislead the diagnosis.

#### Special Tests

**1. [[Thompson Test]] (Simmonds' Test)**
This is the **gold standard** clinical test for diagnosing a complete Achilles tendon rupture.

*   **Position:** Patient lies prone (face down) with feet hanging off the edge of the bed, or knees flexed to 90 degrees.
*   **Technique:** The examiner squeezes the [[Calf Muscle]] belly firmly.
*   **Normal Response (Negative Test):** The foot passively plantarflexes (points downward) due to the intact tension transmission from the muscle to the foot.
*   **Abnormal Response (Positive Test):** The foot **remains still** (does not plantarflex). This indicates a complete disruption of the continuity between the calf muscles and the foot.

**2. Matles Test (Knee Flexion Test)**
*   Patient lies prone and flexes knees to 90 degrees.
*   **Positive Sign:** The foot on the affected side falls into neutral or slight dorsiflexion due to loss of normal resting tension (normally, the foot should remain slightly plantarflexed).

**3. O'Brien's Needle Test**
*   A sterile needle is inserted into the tendon proximal to the suspected rupture site.
*   The foot is moved. If the needle moves in the opposite direction to the tendon movement, the tendon is intact. If the needle does not move or moves paradoxically, it suggests rupture. (Rarely used now due to invasiveness).

**4. Sphygmomanometer Test (Copeland Test)**
*   A BP cuff is wrapped around the calf and inflated to 100 mmHg with the knee flexed.
*   Dorsiflexion of the foot should cause the pressure to rise to approx. 140 mmHg. If the pressure remains steady, it indicates rupture.

#### Imaging
*   **Ultrasound:** Excellent for confirming the diagnosis, distinguishing partial vs. complete tears, and assessing the gap distance.
*   **MRI:** The definitive investigation. Shows the exact site, extent of the tear, and condition of the tendon ends. Useful for chronic or neglected ruptures.
*   **X-ray:** Generally normal but may show:
    *   Loss of Kager’s triangle (fat pad lucency).
    *   Soft tissue swelling.
    *   Rule out avulsion fracture of the [[Calcaneus]].

#### Treatment

**1. Conservative Management**
*   **Indication:** Older patients, low functional demand, significant medical comorbidities, or gap <5mm in equinus.
*   **Method:** Immobilization in a below-knee cast or functional brace with the foot in **equinus** (plantarflexion) to approximate the tendon ends.
    *   The foot is gradually brought to neutral over 6–8 weeks.
*   **Pros:** Avoids surgical risks (wound infection, skin necrosis).
*   **Cons:** Higher rate of **re-rupture**, potentially reduced muscle strength.

**2. Surgical Management**
*   **Indication:** Young active patients, athletes, delayed presentation, or failed conservative treatment.
*   **Method:**
    *   **Open Repair:** End-to-end suturing (e.g., Kessler or Bunnell sutures).
    *   **Percutaneous Repair:** Minimally invasive, lower wound complication risk but higher risk of [[Sural Nerve]] injury.
*   **Pros:** Lower re-rupture rate, earlier mobilization, better functional power.
*   **Cons:** Risk of wound breakdown, infection, and nerve injury.

#### Clinical Implications
*   **Missed Diagnosis:** Up to 25% of ruptures are missed initially because patients can still actively plantarflex using accessory muscles (Long toe flexors). Always perform the [[Thompson Test]].
*   **Fluoroquinolones:** Use of antibiotics like Ciprofloxacin is a risk factor for tendon degeneration and rupture.
*   **Steroid Injections:** Direct injection into the Achilles tendon is contraindicated due to high risk of rupture.

*   **C**ompromised biomechanics
*   **L**ifestyle (Weekend warrior)
*   **E**lderly (Age > 30-40)
