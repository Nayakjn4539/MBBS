# [[Diseases Of Conjunctiva]] > Conjuctival Degeneration

# Degenerative Conditions of the Conjunctiva

Degenerative conditions of the [[conjunctiva]] are common ocular surface disorders characterized by structural changes in the conjunctival tissue, often linked to environmental exposure and aging.

## 1. Pinguecula

**Definition**: A yellowish-white, triangular, nodular deposit on the [[bulbar conjunctiva]] near the [[limbus]]. The term is derived from *pinguis* (fat), though it does not contain fat.

*   **Etiology**:
    *   Age-related change.
    *   Chronic exposure to [[ultraviolet radiation]] (sunlight), dust, and wind.
*   **Pathology**:
    *   **Elastotic degeneration** of collagen fibers of the [[substantia propria]].
    *   Hyaline infiltration.
    *   Deposition of amorphous material.
    *   The overlying epithelium may be thinned or hyperkeratotic.
*   **Clinical Features**:
    *   **Appearance**: Yellowish, triangular nodule with the apex away from the [[cornea]].
    *   **Location**: Usually bilateral; affects the **nasal side first**, then the temporal side.
    *   **Symptoms**: Usually asymptomatic. May cause cosmetic concern or foreign body sensation.
    *   **Pingueculitis**: Occasionally becomes inflamed (red and irritated).
*   **Treatment**:
    *   Usually, no treatment is required.
    *   **Lubricating eye drops** for irritation.
    *   Topical weak [[steroids]] if inflamed (Pingueculitis).
    *   Excision is rarely indicated (only for severe cosmetic reasons).

## 2. Pterygium

**Definition**: A wing-shaped, triangular fold of fibrovascular tissue growing from the [[conjunctiva]] onto the [[cornea]]. It destroys the [[Bowman's membrane]] and superficial [[stroma]].

*   **Etiology**:
    *   **Environmental**: Prolonged exposure to [[ultraviolet rays]] (most accepted theory), dry heat, high wind, and dust. Common in "Pterygium Belt" (tropical climates).
    *   **Genetic**: [[p53 gene]] mutation related to UV damage.
    *   **Pathogenesis**: [[Limbal stem cell]] deficiency leading to conjunctivalization of the cornea.
*   **Pathology**:
    *   Degenerative and hyperplastic condition.
    *   **Elastotic degeneration** of subconjunctival tissue.
    *   Proliferation of vascularized granulation tissue under the epithelium.

### Clinical Features
*   **Location**: Usually **nasal**, bilateral (can be asymmetrical).
*   **Parts of Pterygium**:
    1.  **Head**: Apical part encroaching on the cornea.
    2.  **Neck**: Constricted part at the limbus.
    3.  **Body**: Scleral part extending to the [[canthus]].
    4.  **Cap**: Semilunar whitish infiltrate in the cornea just in front of the head (sign of active progression).

### Types of Pterygium

| Feature | Progressive (Active) Pterygium | Regressive (Atrophic) Pterygium |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Appearance** | Thick, fleshy, vascular | Thin, atrophic, attenuated, membranous |
| **Cap** | Present (Fuchs' spots/Islets of Vogt) | Absent |
| **Vascularity** | High | Very little |
| **Growth** | Encroaches onto pupil | Stationary |

### Signs
*   **[[Stocker's line]]**: Deposition of **iron** in the corneal epithelium anterior to the advancing head of the pterygium.
*   **Astigmatism**: Induced **with-the-rule** astigmatism (corneal flattening in the horizontal meridian).

### Differential Diagnosis
Must be differentiated from **[[Pseudopterygium]]**.

| Feature | Pterygium | Pseudopterygium |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Etiology** | Degenerative process | Inflammatory (Burns, [[Marginal corneal ulcer]]) |
| **Site** | Horizontal (Usually Nasal) | Any meridian (at site of injury) |
| **Probe Test** | **Negative** (Probe *cannot* pass under the neck) | **Positive** (Probe *can* be passed under the neck) |
| **Course** | Progressive or stationary | Always stationary |

### Management
**Medical**:
*   **Prevention**: UV protection (sunglasses).
*   **Symptomatic**: Topical lubricants (artificial tears) and decongestants.
*   **Inflammation**: Short course of topical steroids.

**Surgical Indications**:
*   Visual impairment (encroachment on pupillary area).
*   Significant induced [[astigmatism]].
*   Restriction of ocular motility (diplopia).
*   Cosmetic disfigurement.

**Surgical Techniques**:
The main challenge is **recurrence** (30-50% with simple excision).
1.  **Simple Excision (Bare Sclera)**: High recurrence rate (obsolete).
2.  **Excision with [[Conjunctival Limbal Autograft]] (CLAU)**:
    *   **Gold Standard**.
    *   Graft taken from the superotemporal conjunctiva of the same eye (or other eye).
    *   Attached using sutures or fibrin glue.
    *   Lowest recurrence rate.
    *   **P.E.R.F.E.C.T. Surgery** (Pterygium Extended Removal Followed by Extended Conjunctival Transplantation): A modification with near-zero recurrence.
3.  **Excision with [[Mitomycin C]] (MMC)**:
    *   Intraoperative application (0.02%) to the bare sclera.
    *   Reduces recurrence but carries risks (scleral necrosis, scleritis).
4.  **Amniotic Membrane Transplantation**: Used for large or recurrent pterygia.

***Clinical Implication:** Do not wait for the pterygium to cross the pupillary center. Once it crosses, excising it will leave a corneal opacity (scar) in the visual axis, permanently affecting vision.*

## 3. Concretions (Lithiasis)

**Definition**: Minute, hard, yellowish-white raised spots on the [[palpebral conjunctiva]].

*   **Etiology**:
    *   Accumulation of inspissated mucus and dead epithelial cells in the depressions called **Loops of Henle**.
    *   Common in elderly and chronic conjunctivitis (e.g., [[Trachoma]]).
    *   *Note*: The term "Lithiasis" is a misnomer; they are **not** calcium deposits (unless secondary calcification occurs rarely).
*   **Clinical Features**:
    *   Yellowish spots on the upper or lower tarsal conjunctiva.
    *   **Symptoms**: Usually asymptomatic. If they erode through the epithelium, they cause a "foreign body sensation" or pricking sensation.
*   **Treatment**:
    *   None if asymptomatic.
    *   If symptomatic: Removal with a hypodermic needle under topical anesthesia.

## 4. Other Degenerative Conditions

### Amyloid Degeneration
*   **Pathology**: Deposition of [[amyloid]] (an amorphous hyaline material) in the conjunctiva.
*   **Types**:
    *   **Primary**: Localized waxy/yellowish masses.
    *   **Secondary**: Associated with systemic diseases or chronic inflammation (e.g., Trachoma).
*   **Clinical Features**: Yellowish, waxy, friable masses; may cause subconjunctival hemorrhage.
*   **Treatment**: Surgical excision if bothersome.

### Conjunctival Xerosis (Xerophthalmia)
*   **Definition**: Dry, lusterless, non-wettable conjunctiva.
*   **Types**:
    1.  **Epithelial Xerosis**: Due to **[[Vitamin A deficiency]]**. Associated with [[Bitot's spots]] (foamy, triangular spots temporal to limbus).
    2.  **Parenchymatous Xerosis**: Due to cicatricial degeneration (scarring) from local causes (e.g., Trachoma, Chemical burns, [[Stevens-Johnson syndrome]], [[Ocular pemphigoid]]).
*   **Treatment**: Vitamin A supplementation (if deficient) and artificial tears.

### Argyrosis
*   **Definition**: Deep brown/black staining of the conjunctiva.
*   **Cause**: Prolonged application of **silver salts** (silver nitrate/proteinate) used historically for chronic conjunctivitis.
*   **Mechanism**: Impregnation of reduced metallic silver into elastic fibers.
