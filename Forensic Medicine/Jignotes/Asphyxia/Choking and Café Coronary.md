# [[Asphyxia]] > Choking and Café Coronary

# Choking

### Definition
[[Choking]] is a form of mechanical [[asphyxia]] caused by the obstruction of the internal air passages (larynx, trachea, or bronchi) by a foreign body entering through the mouth or nose.

### Mechanism of Death
1.  **Mechanical Occlusion:** The foreign body physically blocks the airway, preventing air entry.
2.  **Laryngeal Spasm:** Even small objects can trigger intense spasm of the laryngeal muscles, causing complete airway closure.
3.  **Vagal Inhibition:** Sudden stimulation of the laryngeal mucosa by the object can cause reflex cardiac arrest ([[vagal inhibition]]).

### Etiology and Predisposing Factors
*   **Children:** Inhalation of coins, buttons, marbles, seeds, or toys. "Creche Coronary" is a term sometimes used for choking in infants/toddlers due to a foreign body.
*   **Adults/Elderly:**
    *   Inhalation of food bolus while talking or laughing (epiglottis fails to close).
    *   Loose dentures.
    *   Vomiting and aspiration (especially in comatose or intoxicated states).
    *   Anesthesia (loss of cough reflex).
    *   Neurological disorders (e.g., Bulbar palsy).

### Clinical Features
*   **"Air Hunger":** Violent coughing, gasping, and wheezing.
*   **Sign:** The victim often clutches their neck (Universal Choking Sign).
*   **Color:** Intense cyanosis (face turns blue/purple).
*   **Progression:** Convulsions $\rightarrow$ Unconsciousness $\rightarrow$ Death.

### Treatment (Emergency)
1.  **Conscious Patient:**
    *   **Back blows:** 5 sharp blows between shoulder blades.
    *   **[[Heimlich maneuver]] (Abdominal Thrusts):** Standing behind the victim, applying upward thrusts to the epigastrium to increase intrathoracic pressure and expel the object.
2.  **Unconscious Patient:** Start CPR. Finger sweep **only** if the object is clearly visible (blind sweeps can push the object deeper).
3.  **Surgical:** Emergency cricothyrotomy or tracheostomy if conservative measures fail.

# Café Coronary

### Definition
[[Café Coronary]] is a specific condition where a person dies suddenly while eating, often due to the impaction of a large food bolus in the larynx/pharynx. It is historically termed so because the sudden collapse mimics a fatal **heart attack (coronary thrombosis)** occurring in a restaurant (café).

### Mechanism
Unlike typical choking which involves violent coughing, Café Coronary is often **silent**.
*   **Reflex Vagal Inhibition:** The large bolus distends the laryngeal nerve endings, triggering a vagal reflex that stops the heart immediately.
*   **Asphyxia:** Complete occlusion of the air inlet (laryngeal vestibule) by the food mass.

### Risk Factors (The "4 Ds")
1.  **D**entures: Poorly fitting dentures or lack of teeth prevent proper chewing.
2.  **D**rink (Alcohol): [[Alcohol intoxication]] depresses the gag reflex and judgment regarding bite size.
3.  **D**isease: Neurological conditions affecting swallowing (dysphagia).
4.  **D**istraction: Talking, laughing, or excitement while eating.

### Diagnosis
*   **History:** Sudden collapse during a meal.
*   **Signs:** Cyanosis may or may not be present depending on whether death was due to vagal inhibition (pale face) or asphyxia (blue face). No sound/coughing is typical.

### Autopsy Findings in Choking and Café Coronary
**External Findings:**
*   **Face:** Cyanosed (deep blue/purple), swollen, and congested.
*   **Eyes:** Petechial hemorrhages in conjunctiva.
*   **Mouth:** Might contain vomit or food particles.

**Internal Findings:**
*   **Airway:** The offending foreign body (e.g., large piece of meat, coin, denture) is found firmly impacted in the larynx (often blocking the glottis) or trachea.
    *   *Note:* In infants, check for inhaled vomit/milk curds in the bronchioles.
*   **Lungs:** Congested, edematous, and may show subpleural [[Tardieu's spots]]. In delayed deaths, signs of aspiration pneumonia may be seen.
*   **Stomach:** Often full (in Café Coronary).
*   **Biochemical:** High Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) is a common associated finding in Café Coronary.

### Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Accidental:** Most cases are accidental (children playing with coins, intoxicated adults eating).
*   **Homicidal:** Rare. Possible in infants or debilitated/invalid adults where a gag or foreign object is forcibly stuffed into the mouth (**Gagging**).
*   **Suicidal:** Extremely rare. Some mentally unstable individuals may attempt to swallow large objects.
*   **Medical Negligence:** Failure to remove dentures during anesthesia or post-operative aspiration can lead to liability.

### Differentiation: Typical Choking vs. Café Coronary

| Feature | Typical Choking | Café Coronary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Onset** | Usually progressive distress | Sudden collapse |
| **Sound** | Noisy (coughing, stridor, wheezing) | **Silent** (complete block/vagal arrest) |
| **Mechanism** | Mechanical Asphyxia | Asphyxia or [[Vagal Inhibition]] |
| **Subject** | Children, Elderly | Intoxicated Adults, Elderly |
| **Object** | Small (coin, seed, small food) | Large (Unchewed meat bolus) |
| **Site** | Trachea / Bronchi | Larynx / Pharynx (Supraglottic) |

### Mnemonic
**Risk Factors for Café Coronary:** **"EAT"**
*   **E**lderly / **E**thanol (Alcohol)
*   **A**bsent teeth (Dentures) / **A**nesthesia (decreased gag reflex)
*   **T**alking while eating / **T**oo big a bite
