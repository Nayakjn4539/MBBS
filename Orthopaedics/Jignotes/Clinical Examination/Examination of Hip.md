# [[Clinical Examination]] > Examination of Hip

# Clinical Examination of the Hip Joint

### 1. General Principles
The hip is a deep-seated [[ball and socket joint]]. Pain from the hip often radiates to the [[knee]]; conversely, groin pain can be referred from the [[lumbar spine]].
*   **Exposure**: Ideally, the patient should be undressed from the umbilicus to the knees (or below mid-thorax). Modesty must be maintained with a loincloth/shorts.
*   **Position**: Examination is performed in Standing, Supine, and Lateral positions.

### 2. Inspection (Look)
Inspection is divided into examination while standing (to assess gait and posture) and while lying down.

#### A. Standing Position
**1. Gait**
Observe the patient walking. Common hip gaits include:
*   **Antalgic Gait**: Painful gait. The stance phase on the affected side is shortened to avoid weight-bearing.
*   **Trendelenburg Gait**: The patient lurches towards the affected side to compensate for weak abductors.
*   **Waddling Gait**: Seen in bilateral [[Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip]] (DDH) or bilateral [[coxa vara]].
*   **Stiff Hip Gait**: Seen in [[ankylosis]].

**2. Posture and Deformity**
*   **Lordosis**: Exaggerated [[lumbar lordosis]] usually indicates a fixed flexion deformity of the hip.
*   **Pelvic Tilt**: Look for scoliosis or pelvic obliquity.
*   **Levels**: Check the level of the [[anterior superior iliac spine]] (ASIS), [[posterior superior iliac spine]] (PSIS), gluteal folds, and popliteal creases.

#### B. Supine Position
**1. Attitude of the Limb**
*   **External Rotation**: Common in fracture neck of femur and [[anterior dislocation]] of hip.
*   **Internal Rotation, Flexion, Adduction**: Classic position for [[posterior dislocation]] of hip.
*   **Fixed Flexion**: The thigh cannot touch the couch without arching the back.

**2. Skin and Soft Tissue**
*   Look for scars, sinuses (common in [[tuberculosis]] or [[chronic osteomyelitis]]), or swelling.
*   Wasting of gluteal or thigh muscles.

### 3. Palpation (Feel)
*   **Temperature**: Assess local warmth (inflammation/infection).
*   **Tenderness**:
    *   **Direct**: Over the femoral head (mid-inguinal point), [[greater trochanter]].
    *   **Indirect**: Heel percussion test (Anvil test) causes pain in the hip in conditions like arthritis or fractures.
*   **Bony Landmarks**: Palpate the ASIS and Greater Trochanter.
    *   **Trochanteric Thickening**: Suggests trochanteric bursitis or infection.
    *   **Proximal Migration**: Indicates shortening of the limb (e.g., [[fracture neck of femur]], DDH).

### 4. Movements and Special Tests for Deformity

**Range of Motion (ROM)**
*   Movements are tested actively and passively.
*   Compare with the normal side.
*   **Flexion**: Normal 0–120°.
*   **Abduction/Adduction**: Stabilize the pelvis by feeling the opposite ASIS. Movement stops when the pelvis starts to tilt.
*   **Rotation**: Tested in extension (rolling the leg) and in 90° flexion.

#### A. Thomas Test (For Fixed Flexion Deformity)
This is the most critical test to unmask a fixed flexion deformity (FFD) that is camouflaged by compensatory [[lumbar lordosis]].

**Procedure:**
1.  Patient lies supine on a hard surface.
2.  The examiner passes a hand behind the patient's lumbar spine to feel the lordosis.
3.  Flex the **normal/sound hip** and knee maximally until the thigh touches the abdomen. This obliterates the lumbar lordosis (the hand behind the back gets squeezed).
4.  Observe the affected thigh. If there is an FFD, the affected thigh will rise off the couch.
5.  **Angle of Deformity**: The angle formed between the affected thigh and the bed is the degree of fixed flexion deformity.

> **Clinical Implication:** If the patient keeps the leg flat on the bed but has arching of the back, the deformity is masked. Thomas test reveals the true deformity.

#### B. Trendelenburg Test (For Abductor Mechanism)
This tests the integrity of the hip abductor mechanism (Abductor lever arm).
*   **Components of the Mechanism**:
    1.  Fulcrum: The [[hip joint]] (head of femur in acetabulum).
    2.  Power: The [[gluteus medius]] and minimus muscles.
    3.  Lever: The [[neck of femur]].

**Procedure:**
1.  Patient stands on the **affected/test leg** and lifts the normal leg off the ground.
2.  Observe the pelvis (iliac crests/gluteal folds) from behind.

**Interpretation:**
*   **Negative (Normal)**: The pelvis on the unsupported (sound) side **rises** slightly to maintain balance. This is due to the contraction of abductors on the standing side.
*   **Positive (Abnormal)**: The pelvis on the unsupported (sound) side **drops/sags**.

**Causes of Positive Trendelenburg (Sound Side Sags):**
1.  **Paralysis/Weakness**: [[Polio]], superior gluteal nerve injury.
2.  **Fulcrum Instability**: [[DDH]], dislocation.
3.  **Lever Arm Defect**: Fracture neck of femur, [[coxa vara]], Perthes disease.
4.  **Pain**: Non-union, osteoarthritis (pain inhibits muscle contraction).

> **Mnemonic:** **S**ound **S**ide **S**ags = **P**ositive (**SSS** = **P**ositive Trendelenburg).

### 5. Measurements (Limb Length)
Before measuring, the pelvis must be "squared" (both ASIS at the same level perpendicular to the body axis). If there is an adduction/abduction deformity, the good limb must be placed in a similar position of adduction/abduction to make the pelvis parallel.

#### A. Apparent Length
*   **Landmarks**: From the **xiphisternum** (or umbilicus) to the **medial malleolus**.
*   **Significance**: Measures functional length. Shortening here (without true shortening) is due to pelvic tilt or adduction deformity (apparent shortening) or abduction deformity (apparent lengthening).

#### B. True Length
*   **Landmarks**: From the **[[Anterior Superior Iliac Spine]] (ASIS)** to the **medial malleolus**.
*   **Significance**: Indicates actual bone shortening.

#### C. Assessment of Shortening Level
If true shortening is present, identify the segment:
1.  **Galeazzi Sign (Allis Test)**: Patient supine, hips flexed 45°, knees flexed 90°, feet together on the bed.
    *   If one knee is higher: Tibial lengthening.
    *   If one knee is projecting forward: Femoral lengthening.
2.  **Supratrochanteric Shortening**: Indicates pathology above the trochanter (Head/Neck of femur or Acetabulum). Tested by:
    *   **Bryant's Triangle**: Patient supine. Drop a vertical line from ASIS. Draw a horizontal line from the tip of the [[greater trochanter]] to meet the vertical line. Measure the distance. Compare with the normal side. A shorter distance indicates upward migration of the trochanter.
    *   **Nelaton's Line**: A line drawn from the ASIS to the [[ischial tuberosity]]. Normally, the tip of the greater trochanter lies *on* or *below* this line. In supratrochanteric shortening (e.g., Dislocation, Coxa Vara), the trochanter crosses *above* this line.
    *   **Shoemaker's Line**: A straight line joining the tip of the greater trochanter and the ASIS usually passes *above* the umbilicus. If the trochanter is elevated, this line passes *below* the umbilicus.

### 6. Special Tests for Stability and Pathology

#### A. Telescopy Test
Used to check for hip instability (e.g., [[DDH]] or non-union).
*   **Procedure**: Patient supine. Flex hip and knee to 90°. One hand stabilizes the pelvis; the other grasps the thigh and pushes down and pulls up along the femoral axis.
*   **Positive**: Significant "piston-like" movement is felt.

#### B. Ober’s Test
Tests for contracture of the [[Iliotibial band]] (IT band).
*   **Procedure**: Patient in lateral decubitus on the normal side. Flex the normal hip/knee. Abduct and extend the affected hip to relax the IT band, then allow gravity to adduct the thigh.
*   **Positive**: The thigh remains abducted and does not drop down (due to tight fascia lata).

#### C. Patrick’s Test (FABERE Test)
Tests for [[Sacroiliac joint]] or Hip pathology.
*   **Procedure**: **F**lexion, **AB**duction, **E**xternal **R**otation, **E**xtension. The ankle of the test leg is placed on the opposite knee (Figure-of-4). Press down on the flexed knee.
*   **Positive**: Pain in the groin (Hip) or buttock (SI Joint).,,,,,,,,,,,
