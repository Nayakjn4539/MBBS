# Tumors of Hypopharynx

## Anatomy of the Hypopharynx
### Structure and Extent
The [[Hypopharynx]] (or Laryngopharynx) is the lowest part of the [[Pharynx]], situated behind and partly to the sides of the [[Larynx]].
*   **Extent:** It extends from the superior level of the [[Hyoid bone]] (or floor of the [[Vallecula]]) to the lower border of the [[Cricoid cartilage]] (Level C3/C4 to C6 vertebrae), where it becomes continuous with the [[Esophagus]].
*   **Shape:** It is a funnel-shaped structure.

### Subsites of Hypopharynx
The hypopharynx is anatomically divided into three distinct regions:
1.  **[[Pyriform Sinus]] (Fossa):** A pear-shaped trough lateral to the aryepiglottic folds. It extends from the pharyngoepiglottic fold to the upper end of the esophagus. It is bounded laterally by the thyroid cartilage and medially by the cricoid and arytenoid cartilages.
2.  **[[Post-cricoid Region]]:** The anterior wall of the hypopharynx, extending from the level of the arytenoid cartilages to the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage.
3.  **[[Posterior Pharyngeal Wall]]:** Extends from the level of the hyoid bone to the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage.

### Blood and Nerve Supply
*   **Nerve Supply:**
    *   **Sensory:** The upper part (Pyriform fossa) is supplied by the **[[Internal Laryngeal Nerve]]** (branch of [[Vagus nerve]]). It runs submucosally in the lateral wall of the sinus.
    *   **Motor/Sensory (Lower):** Supplied by the **[[Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve]]**.
*   **Arterial Supply:** Branches from the superior thyroid, lingual, and ascending pharyngeal arteries.

### Lymphatic Drainage
The hypopharynx has a rich lymphatic network, particularly the **pyriform fossa**.
*   **Pyriform Fossa:** Drains to upper deep cervical nodes (Level II), middle (Level III), and lower (Level IV) nodes.
*   **Posterior Wall:** Drains to [[Retropharyngeal lymph nodes]] (Nodes of Rouviere) and parapharyngeal nodes.
*   **Post-cricoid:** Drains to parapharyngeal, supraclavicular, and paratracheal nodes.

### Clinical Anatomy & Implications
*   **Foreign Bodies:** The pyriform fossa forms a lateral channel for food and is the most common site for foreign body lodgment.
*   **Referred Pain:** Since the Internal Laryngeal Nerve (Branch of Vagus) supplies the pyriform fossa and the Vagus also supplies the ear (Arnold's nerve), malignancy here often presents with referred **[[Otalgia]]**.
*   **Anesthesia:** The internal laryngeal nerve is easily accessible for local anesthesia in the lateral wall of the pyriform sinus.
*   **Silent Area:** The pyriform sinus is large, so tumors can grow significantly before causing obstruction, often presenting late with neck nodes.

## Malignant Tumors of Hypopharynx

### Epidemiology and Etiology
*   **Incidence:** Hypopharyngeal cancer is common in India but rare in the West. It has the **worst overall survival rate** of any head and neck cancer.
*   **Age/Sex:** Commonly affects males >40 years, except for **post-cricoid carcinoma**, which is more common in females.
*   **Predisposing Factors:**
    *   **Smoking & Alcohol:** Most important factors; synergistic effect increases risk significantly.
    *   **[[Plummer-Vinson Syndrome]]** (Paterson-Brown-Kelly Syndrome): Iron deficiency anemia, dysphagia, and post-cricoid webs. Associated with post-cricoid carcinoma in females.
    *   **Nutritional Deficiencies:** Vitamin C and iron deficiency.
    *   **Previous Radiation:** Can induce malignancy.

### Pathology
*   **Histology:** **[[Squamous Cell Carcinoma]] (SCC)** accounts for >95% of cases.
*   **Gross Appearance:** Can be **Exophytic** (proliferative), **Ulcerative** (most common in post-cricoid), or Infiltrative.
*   **Site Distribution:**
    1.  **Pyriform Sinus:** Most common (60%).
    2.  **Post-cricoid:** (30%).
    3.  **Posterior Pharyngeal Wall:** Least common (10%).

### Clinical Features
Patients often present with late-stage disease.

**Symptoms:**
*   **[[Dysphagia]]:** Progressive (solids to liquids). Most common symptom.
*   **[[Odynophagia]]:** Pain on swallowing.
*   **Referred Otalgia:** Ear pain with normal ear examination (Red Flag).
*   **Neck Mass:** Metastatic lymphadenopathy is often the *presenting* symptom (esp. pyriform fossa tumors).
*   **Hoarseness:** Indicates extension to the larynx (fixation of vocal cord) or recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement.
*   **Stridor:** Late sign indicating airway obstruction.
*   **Weight loss/Cachexia:** Due to inability to eat.

**Signs:**
*   **Pooling of Saliva:** Seen in the pyriform fossa on laryngoscopy (Chevalier Jackson's sign).
*   **Laryngeal Crepitus:** **Absent** in post-cricoid carcinoma (tumor pushes cricoid away from vertebrae).
*   **Neck Nodes:** Hard, non-tender, often Level II/III/IV.
*   **Laryngeal Tenderness:** Suggests cartilage invasion.

### Mnemonic for Symptoms
**P-H-A-R-Y-N-X**
*   **P**ain (Throat/Ear)
*   **H**oarseness (Laryngeal involvement)
*   **A**irway obstruction (Stridor)
*   **R**eferred Otalgia
*   **Y**ucky breath (Halitosis/Necrosis)
*   **N**ode in neck (Mass)
*   **X**-cessive weight loss

## Investigations and Diagnosis

| Investigation | Findings / Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Flexible Laryngoscopy]]** | Initial evaluation to visualize ulcerative or exophytic mass and pooling of saliva. |
| **[[Biopsy]]** | **Mandatory.** Done via Direct Laryngoscopy (Panendoscopy) to confirm histology. |
| **[[CT Scan]] (CECT)** | Assessment of tumor extent, cartilage invasion (thyroid/cricoid), and nodal status. Distinguishes tumor from abscess. |
| **[[MRI]]** | Better soft tissue delineation; sensitive for early cartilage invasion. |
| **[[Barium Swallow]]** | Shows filling defects (rat-tail appearance), pharyngeal webs, or aspiration. Useful for post-cricoid lesions. |
| **Chest X-ray/CT Chest** | To rule out pulmonary metastasis or second primary. |

## Staging (TNM Classification - AJCC)

| T-Stage | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tis** | Carcinoma in situ. |
| **T1** | Tumor $\le$ 2 cm, limited to one subsite. |
| **T2** | Tumor > 2 cm but $\le$ 4 cm, OR invades >1 subsite without hemilarynx fixation. |
| **T3** | Tumor > 4 cm OR with **fixation of hemilarynx**. |
| **T4a** | Invades thyroid/cricoid cartilage, hyoid, thyroid gland, esophagus, or strap muscles (Resectable). |
| **T4b** | Invades pre-vertebral fascia, encases carotid artery, or mediastinal structures (Unresectable). |

**N-Stage:** Follows standard head and neck rules (N1: single ipsilateral $\le$ 3cm, N2: intermediate, N3: >6cm).

## Management

Management is complex and involves a multidisciplinary team. It aims to cure the disease while preserving speech and swallowing functions.

### 1. Early Stage (T1, T2)
*   **[[Radiotherapy]] (RT):** Curative intent. Preserves laryngeal function.
*   **Surgery:** Conservative surgery (Partial Pharyngectomy) is an option but less common due to functional morbidity.

### 2. Advanced Stage (T3, T4)
Requires **Combined Modality Treatment**.
*   **Surgery:** **[[Total Laryngectomy]] with Partial Pharyngectomy**.
    *   Often includes **Neck Dissection** (Level II-IV).
    *   If the esophagus is involved: **Total Laryngo-Pharyngo-Esophagectomy (TLPE)**.
*   **Reconstruction:**
    *   Defects require reconstruction using **Pectoralis Major Myocutaneous Flap** (PMMC) or **Free Jejunal Flap** or **Gastric Pull-up** (for TLPE).
*   **Post-operative Radiotherapy:** Almost always indicated for advanced disease.
*   **[[Chemoradiotherapy]] (Organ Preservation):** Concurrent Cisplatin + RT is an alternative to radical surgery for organ preservation, though toxicity is higher.

### 3. Palliative Care
For unresectable disease (T4b) or poor general condition.
*   **Tracheostomy:** For airway security.
*   **Gastrostomy/Ryle's Tube:** For feeding.
*   **Palliative RT/Chemotherapy**.

### Prognosis
*   Hypopharyngeal cancer has the **worst survival rate** in head and neck cancers.
*   5-year survival: Early stage ~40-50%; Advanced stage ~20-30%.
