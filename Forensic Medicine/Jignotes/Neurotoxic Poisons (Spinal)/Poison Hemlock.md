# [[Neurotoxic Poisons (Spinal)]] > Poison Hemlock

# Poison Hemlock (*Conium maculatum*)

### Introduction
Poison Hemlock, also known as **Spotted Hemlock**, is a highly poisonous plant belonging to the family *Umbelliferae* (Apiaceae). It is historically significant as the poison used for the state execution of **Socrates** in 399 BC. It is classified as a [[Peripheral Nerve Poison]].

### Botanical Features
*   **Appearance:** It grows 3 to 6 feet high. The stem is hollow, smooth, and distinguished by **purple spots** (hence "maculatum" or spotted).
*   **Leaves:** Fern-like, resembling parsley or coriander.
*   **Odor:** The fresh plant, especially when crushed or rubbed with alkali, emits a strong, unpleasant **"mousy" odor** (smell of mice).
*   **Toxic Parts:** [[All parts]] of the plant are poisonous.
    *   **Root:** Most toxic during early spring/summer.
    *   **Leaves:** Toxic at flowering time.
    *   **Fruit/Seeds:** Unripe fruit contains the highest concentration of alkaloids.

### Active Principles
The plant contains volatile liquid alkaloids (Piperidine alkaloids):
1.  **[[Coniine]]** (Most potent; accounts for 90% of toxicity).
2.  Methyl-coniine.
3.  Conhydrine.
4.  Gamma-coniceine.

### Mechanism of Action
[[Coniine]] is structurally similar to nicotine. It acts on the **Peripheral Nervous System** and the **Neuromuscular Junction (NMJ)**.
1.  **Curare-like action:** It produces a non-depolarizing blockade at the neuromuscular junction.
2.  **Biphasic Action:** Initially stimulates, but subsequently **depresses** the autonomic ganglia (nicotinic receptors).
3.  **CNS:** It does **not** cross the blood-brain barrier significantly; therefore, the victim remains **conscious** until the terminal stages (unlike opium or alcohol).
4.  **Death:** Caused by respiratory failure due to paralysis of respiratory muscles (diaphragm and intercostals).

### Clinical Features
Symptoms appear rapidly, usually within **30 minutes to 1 hour** of ingestion.

**1. Gastrointestinal Irritation**
*   Burning sensation in the mouth and throat.
*   Nausea, vomiting (sometimes vomiting is absent).
*   Abdominal pain and diarrhea.
*   Salivation (initial) followed by dryness.

**2. Neuromuscular System (The "Hemlock Paralysis")**
*   **[[Ascending Paralysis]]:** Weakness begins in the lower limbs (heaviness of legs).
*   The victim staggers and falls (ataxia).
*   Paralysis ascends to the trunk and upper limbs.
*   **Speech and Swallowing:** Paralysis of pharyngeal and laryngeal muscles leads to dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and aphonia (loss of voice).
*   **Ptosis:** Drooping of eyelids due to extraocular muscle weakness.

**3. Respiratory System**
*   Labored breathing (Dyspnea).
*   Cyanosis.
*   **Respiratory failure/paralysis** is the terminal event.

**4. CNS and Mental Status**
*   **Consciousness is retained** almost until death. The mind remains clear while the body is paralyzed.
*   Pupils are dilated (mydriasis).
*   Convulsions are rare but may occur due to asphyxia.

### Fatal Dose and Fatal Period
*   **Fatal Dose:**
    *   **Coniine:** 60 mg.
    *   **Plant material:** Variable (approx. 2–3 leaves or a few seeds can be lethal).
*   **Fatal Period:** 1 to 3 hours (Rapid).

### Mnemonic: **"HEMLOCK"**
*   **H** - **H**eaviness of legs (Ascending paralysis)
*   **E** - **E**ye pupils dilated (Mydriasis) / Execution of Socrates
*   **M** - **M**ousy odor
*   **L** - **L**ungs fail (Respiratory paralysis)
*   **O** - **O**nly motor paralysis (Sensory intact)
*   **C** - **C**onsciousness retained till end
*   **K** - **K**ills rapidly (1–3 hours)

### Treatment
There is **no specific antidote**. Treatment is aggressive supportive care.
1.  **Decontamination:**
    *   **Stomach wash** ([[Gastric lavage]]) with dilute Potassium Permanganate (1:5000) or warm water containing tannic acid/iodine.
    *   **Activated Charcoal** to adsorb the alkaloid.
    *   Purgatives to remove the poison from the gut.
2.  **Respiratory Support (Crucial):**
    *   **Artificial respiration** or **Mechanical Ventilation** is life-saving and must be continued until the paralysis wears off and the drug is eliminated.
3.  **Symptomatic Management:**
    *   Treat hypotension with vasopressors.
    *   Treat convulsions (if any) with Diazepam.
    *   Forced diuresis (acidification of urine) may help in excretion (Coniine is alkaline).

### Autopsy Findings
The findings are generally non-specific (Asphyxial signs).
1.  **External:**
    *   Signs of asphyxia (Cyanosis of lips and nails).
    *   Postmortem staining may be deep purple/congested.
2.  **Internal:**
    *   **Stomach:** Mucosa may be congested or inflamed. Presence of fragments of leaves or roots (botanical identification).
    *   **Odor:** A characteristic **"Mousy" odor** may be perceived upon opening the stomach or cranial cavity.
    *   **Lungs:** Congested and edematous (asphyxial death).
    *   **Viscera:** Generalised congestion.

### Medicolegal Aspects
1.  **Accidental:** Most common.
    *   Leaves mistaken for **Parsley** or **Coriander**.
    *   Roots mistaken for **Parsnips**, **Sweet Potatoes**, or Horse-radish.
    *   Seeds mistaken for Aniseed.
    *   Children using hollow stems as whistles or "pea-shooters" (can absorb poison through buccal mucosa).
    *   Game birds (quails) feeding on hemlock buds may poison humans who eat the bird (**Coturnism**).
2.  **Homicidal:** Rare in modern times due to bitter taste and smell. Historically famous as the method of execution for **[[Socrates]]**.
3.  **Suicidal:** Rare.
