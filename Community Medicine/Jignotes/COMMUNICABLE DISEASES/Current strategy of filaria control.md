# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Current strategy of filaria control

### Current Strategy for Filaria Control

The current strategy is driven by the **National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme ([[NVBDCP]])** with the ultimate goal of the **Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (ELF)**. The target is to reduce the disease burden so that it is no longer a public health problem, defined as a microfilaria carrier rate of less than 1%.

The strategy rests on two main pillars: **Interruption of Transmission** and **Morbidity Management**,.

---

#### 1. Interruption of Transmission: Mass Drug Administration (MDA)
This is the core component of the elimination strategy. It involves the administration of a single dose of antifilarial drugs to the entire eligible population in endemic areas once a year for 5–6 years,.

**The Regimens:**
Currently, two main drug combinations are used depending on the area:

| Regimen | Drugs Used | Dosage | Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DA (Dual Therapy)** | **[[DEC]]** (Diethylcarbamazine) + **Albendazole** | DEC: 6 mg/kg <br> Albendazole: 400 mg | Annual single dose |
| **IDA (Triple Therapy)** | **Ivermectin** + **DEC** + **Albendazole** | Ivermectin: 150-200 mcg/kg <br> DEC: 6 mg/kg <br> Albendazole: 400 mg | Annual single dose |

*   **Triple Drug Therapy (IDA):** Introduced recently under the *Accelerated Plan for Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (APELF)* to speed up the interruption of transmission.
*   **DEC Medicated Salt:** A special form of mass treatment where common salt is medicated with 1–4 g of DEC per kg. It is used in specific endemic areas (e.g., Lakshadweep) for 6–9 months,.

**Exclusion Criteria for MDA:**
Drugs are distributed to everyone **EXCEPT**,:
*   Pregnant women
*   Children below 2 years of age
*   Seriously ill persons

**[[Transmission Assessment Survey (TAS)]]:**
This is the evaluation tool. Districts stop MDA only after passing the TAS, which determines if transmission has been lowered to a critical cutoff point,.

---

#### 2. Morbidity Management and Disability Prevention (MMDP)
While MDA stops new infections, MMDP cares for those already suffering. This strategy focuses on home-based care and surgical interventions.

*   **Management of [[Lymphoedema]] (Elephantiasis):**
    *   **Hygiene:** Frequent washing and drying of the affected limb to prevent secondary bacterial and fungal infections.
    *   **Care:** Prevention and treatment of entry lesions (cracks/wounds).
    *   **Elevation:** Limb elevation and exercise to promote lymph drainage.
    *   **Mascot:** The NLEP uses the mascot "SAPNA" to increase awareness.

*   **Management of [[Hydrocele]]:**
    *   Up-scaling of hydrocele operations in identified Community Health Centres (CHCs) and District Hospitals.
    *   Enumeration of cases (line listing) to ensure access to surgery.

#### 3. Integrated Vector Control
Vector control supplements chemotherapy to reduce the mosquito population and prevent bites.

*   **Anti-Larval Measures:**
    *   **Chemical:** Use of mosquito larvicidal oil (MLO), Temephos, and Fenthion in polluted stagnant water.
    *   **Biological:** Use of larvivorous fish like *[[Gambusia affinis]]* and *Poecilia* (Guppy) in water bodies,.
    *   **Environmental:** Source reduction, filling ditches, and **de-weeding** (removal of *Pistia* plants) to control *Mansonia* mosquitoes,.

*   **Anti-Adult Measures:**
    *   Indoor residual spraying with DDT/BHC has been largely discontinued due to resistance.
    *   **Pyrethrum** is used as a space spray for temporary protection,.

*   **Personal Prophylaxis:**
    *   Use of **[[Insecticide Treated Bed Nets (ITBN)]]** and Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs).
    *   Screening of houses and use of repellents.

---

### **Clinical Relevance**
*   **Acute Attack:** Known as **[[Acute Dermatolymphangioadenitis (ADLA)]]**. It presents with high fever, pain, and swelling. Management involves antibiotics (to treat secondary infection), analgesics, and limb elevation. Antifilarial drugs (DEC) are **NOT** given during an acute attack as they may provoke reactions,.
*   **Occult Filariasis:** Presents as **[[Tropical Pulmonary Eosinophilia (TPE)]]**, characterized by nocturnal cough, wheezing, and high eosinophil counts.

### **Mnemonic**
To remember the strategy for Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (**ELF**): **"M-E-L-T"**

*   **M** - **M**ass Drug Administration (DEC + Albendazole)
*   **E** - **E**xclude Pregnant women & Children < 2 years
*   **L** - **L**ymphoedema management (Washing/Hygiene)
*   **T** - **T**ransmission Assessment Survey (to stop MDA) / **T**riple Drug Therapy (IDA)
