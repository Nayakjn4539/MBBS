# [[DEMOGRAPHY AND FAMILY PLANNING]] > NRR may be regarded superior method to GRR for measuring population growth

### Net Reproduction Rate (NRR) vs. Gross Reproduction Rate (GRR)

To understand why [[Net Reproduction Rate]] (NRR) is superior to [[Gross Reproduction Rate]] (GRR), we must first look at what each indicator measures regarding population growth and fertility.

### 1. Definitions

*   **Gross Reproduction Rate (GRR):** This is the average number of **daughters** that would be born to a woman (or a group of women) if she experiences the current fertility pattern throughout her reproductive span (15–49 years), **assuming no mortality**.
*   **Net Reproduction Rate (NRR):** This is the number of **daughters** a newborn girl will bear during her lifetime, assuming fixed age-specific fertility **and mortality rates**.

### 2. Why is NRR Superior?

NRR is considered a better demographic indicator than GRR for the following reasons:

*   **The Mortality Factor:** GRR assumes that *all* female children born will survive to reach the reproductive age and will live through the entire reproductive span (15–49 years) to produce children. This is a hypothetical and unrealistic assumption. NRR, however, takes into account the **survival rates** (mortality) of the females. It acknowledges that some girls will die before reaching puberty, and some will die during the reproductive years.
*   **Realistic Replacement:** NRR indicates the actual replacement potential of the population. It tells us whether the current generation of women is effectively replacing itself with daughters who will survive to bear the next generation.
*   **Value Comparison:** Because NRR accounts for deaths, the NRR is **always lower** than the GRR (unless mortality is zero, which is theoretically impossible).

### 3. Comparison Table: GRR vs. NRR

| Feature | [[Gross Reproduction Rate]] (GRR) | [[Net Reproduction Rate]] (NRR) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Component** | Measures fertility only. | Measures both **fertility and mortality**. |
| **Assumption** | Assumes **no mortality** among women from birth through the reproductive age. | Allows for **mortality** of women from birth through the reproductive age. |
| **Accuracy** | Theoretical maximum; tends to overestimate population growth. | Realistic estimate; accurately predicts future population growth. |
| **Relation** | GRR is always **>** NRR. | NRR is always **<** GRR. |
| **Significance** | Indicates total fertility potential without loss. | Indicates the **replacement level** of the population. |

### 4. Interpretation of NRR

The value of NRR is a crucial [[Demographic Indicator]] for public health policy:

*   **NRR = 1:** This represents the **Replacement Level of Fertility**. It means that each generation of mothers is exactly reproducing itself. This leads to a stable population (zero population growth).
*   **NRR < 1:** The reproductive performance of the population is **below replacement level**. The population will eventually decrease.
*   **NRR > 1:** The population is growing (increasing).

### 5. Clinical and Programmatic Relevance

*   **Demographic Goal:** The National Population Policy and Health Policy targets in India often aim for **NRR = 1**. This is equivalent to attaining the **2-child norm**.
*   **Relation to TFR:** NRR of 1 is roughly equivalent to a [[Total Fertility Rate]] (TFR) of **2.1**.
*   **Relation to CPR:** Demographers estimate that the goal of **NRR = 1** can be achieved only if the [[Couple Protection Rate]] (CPR) exceeds **60%**.

### Mnemonic
**"G" for Gross = "G" for Ghost**
(GRR assumes women live like ghosts—immortal—ignoring death/mortality).
**"N" for Net = "N" for Natural**
(NRR is the natural reality where mortality happens).
