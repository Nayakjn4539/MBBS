# [[Medical Law And Ethics]] > Euthanasia and Physician Assisted Suicide

### Definition
The term **Euthanasia** is derived from the Greek words *Eu* (Good) and *Thanatos* (Death). It refers to the practice of producing a painless death for a person suffering from a hopelessly incurable and painful disease to end their suffering. It is often referred to as "Mercy Killing".

**Physician-Assisted Suicide (PAS)** differs slightly; it involves the physician providing the means (e.g., prescribing a lethal dose of drugs) or information to the patient, but the patient performs the final act of administration to end their own life.

### Classification of Euthanasia

Euthanasia is broadly classified based on the method (Commission vs. Omission) and the consent of the patient.

#### 1. Based on Mode of Action

| Type | Definition | Mechanism | Legal Status (India) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Active Euthanasia]]** | Causing death by a direct, positive act (Act of Commission). | Administration of lethal drugs (e.g., Barbiturates, [[Potassium Chloride]], Muscle relaxants). | **Illegal** (Amounts to Culpable Homicide/Murder). |
| **[[Passive Euthanasia]]** | Causing death by discontinuing life-sustaining measures (Act of Omission). | Withdrawing ventilator, stopping dialysis, withholding antibiotics or feeding tubes. | **Legal** (Under strict judicial guidelines and Advance Medical Directives). |

#### 2. Based on Consent

*   **Voluntary Euthanasia:** The patient, being of sound mind, explicitly requests death to end suffering.
*   **Non-Voluntary Euthanasia:** The patient is unable to give consent (e.g., comatose, [[Persistent Vegetative State]], severely defective neonates). The decision is made by surrogates/courts.
*   **Involuntary Euthanasia:** Death is induced against the will of the patient (competent patient who has not consented). This is ethically and legally considered **Murder**.

### Specific Concepts

*   **Terminal Sedation:** Administration of high doses of sedatives/analgesics (like [[Morphine]]) to relieve extreme pain, which may unintentionally hasten death. This is often accepted under the **Doctrine of Double Effect** (primary intent is relief of pain, death is a foreseen but unintended side effect).
*   **[[Living Will]] (Advance Medical Directive):** A legal document where a person specifies their preferences regarding medical treatment (e.g., "Do Not Resuscitate" or "Do Not Intubate") in case they become incapacitated in the future.
*   **Battlefield Euthanasia:** Mercy killing of a severely wounded soldier in war to prevent capture/torture by the enemy or to end unbearable suffering when no aid is available.

### Legal Status in India

1.  **Right to Life:** [[Article 21]] of the Constitution guarantees the "Right to Live" but historically did not include the "Right to Die".
2.  **Current Status:**
    *   **Active Euthanasia:** Illegal. Punishable under **Section 302 IPC** (Murder) or **Section 304 IPC** (Culpable Homicide).
    *   **Passive Euthanasia:** The Supreme Court of India has legalized **passive euthanasia** and the validity of **Living Wills** under strict guidelines (Common Cause vs. Union of India, 2018).
    *   **Suicide:** Attempt to commit suicide was punishable under **Section 309 IPC**, but the **[[Mental Healthcare Act, 2017]]** has effectively decriminalized it by presuming severe stress and mandating care rather than punishment.

### Medical Ethics and Regulations (NMC/MCI)

*   **Code of Ethics:** Practicing active euthanasia constitutes **unethical conduct**.
*   **Exception:** Withdrawing supporting devices (ventilators) to sustain cardiopulmonary function in cases of confirmed **[[Brain Stem Death]]** is permitted, primarily for organ transplantation under the **[[Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994]]**.
*   **Declaration of Geneva/Physician's Oath:** "I will maintain the utmost respect for human life." Generally interpreted as prohibiting active killing.

### Medicolegal Aspects and Autopsy Findings

If a case of suspected euthanasia or assisted suicide comes for autopsy, the focus is to distinguish it from natural death or homicide.

1.  **History:** Review medical records for terminal illness, "Do Not Resuscitate" orders, or evidence of depression.
2.  **External Examination:**
    *   Search for **needle puncture marks**, particularly in concealed areas (between toes, under tongue).
    *   Look for transdermal patches (e.g., Fentanyl).
3.  **Toxicology:**
    *   **[[Barbiturates]]** (e.g., Thiopental) and **Muscle Relaxants** (e.g., Pancuronium) are commonly used in lethal injections.
    *   **[[Opioids]]** (Morphine) in high concentrations.
    *   **[[Potassium Chloride]]**: Difficult to detect postmortem as K+ levels rise naturally after death (lysis of cells), but site-specific sampling (vitreous humor vs. peripheral blood) may help.
    *   **[[Insulin]]**: Check for insulin-to-C-peptide ratio to rule out exogenous administration.

### Arguments For and Against

| Arguments **FOR** | Arguments **AGAINST** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Relief from unbearable pain and suffering. | Violation of the sanctity of life. |
| Right to self-determination (Autonomy). | "Slippery Slope" argument: Voluntary may lead to involuntary/non-voluntary. |
| Dignity in death. | Potential for abuse by relatives for inheritance. |
| Reduces burden on family and resources in futile cases. | Discourages advancement in Palliative Care. |

### Mnemonic
**TYPES** of Euthanasia: **A-V-I-N**
*   **A**ctive (Injection)
*   **V**oluntary (Patient asks)
*   **I**nvoluntary (Patient says NO - Murder)
*   **N**on-voluntary (Patient can't say - Coma)
