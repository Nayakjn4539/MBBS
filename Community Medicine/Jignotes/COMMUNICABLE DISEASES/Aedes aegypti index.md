# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Aedes aegypti index

### Aedes Aegypti Index

The **[[Aedes aegypti index]]** is a critical entomological surveillance tool used to measure the density of the *Aedes aegypti* mosquito vector in a specific area. It is primarily used to assess the risk of outbreaks for arboviral diseases like **[[Yellow Fever]]**, **[[Dengue]]**, and **[[Chikungunya]]**.

Historically, under the **[[International Health Regulations]]**, the term "Aedes aegypti index" specifically refers to the **House Index**.

#### 1. Definition and Calculation
The index represents the extent of mosquito breeding in human habitations.

$$ \text{Aedes aegypti Index (House Index)} = \frac{\text{Number of houses positive for breeding}}{\text{Total number of houses examined}} \times 100 $$

*   **Numerator:** Houses (and their premises) where actual breeding (larvae/pupae) is found.
*   **Denominator:** Total houses inspected in a limited, well-defined area.

#### 2. Related Surveillance Indices
While the Aedes aegypti index (House Index) is the classic measure, comprehensive surveillance often utilizes three indices to get a full picture of vector density:

| Index Name | Formula | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[House Index]] (HI)** | $\frac{\text{Positive Houses}}{\text{Total Houses Checked}} \times 100$ | Percentage of houses infested. |
| **[[Container Index]] (CI)** | $\frac{\text{Positive Containers}}{\text{Total Containers Checked}} \times 100$ | Percentage of water-holding containers infested. |
| **[[Breteau Index]] (BI)** | $\frac{\text{Positive Containers}}{\text{Total Houses Checked}} \times 100$ | Number of positive containers per 100 houses. Considered the **most informative** index for transmission risk. |

#### 3. Public Health Targets & Interpretation
These indices are vital for preventing the international spread of **[[Yellow Fever]]**.

*   **The 1% Rule:** To ensure freedom from Yellow Fever, the Aedes aegypti index (specifically the **Breteau Index**) should be **less than 1%** in towns and seaports in endemic areas.
*   **Zero Target:** Ideally, this index is kept at **zero** at international airports and seaports.
*   **The 400-Meter Rule:** Under international regulations, the area extending at least **400 meters** around the perimeter of an airport must be kept free from Aedes aegypti breeding.

#### 4. Clinical and Field Relevance
*   **Vector Bionomics:** *Aedes aegypti* is a domestic breeder. It prefers **artificial collections of water** (flower pots, discarded tins, coolers, tyres). Therefore, the index reflects peridomestic sanitation.
*   **Outbreak Prediction:**
    *   **HI > 10%:** High risk of disease transmission.
    *   **HI < 1%:** Safe level (Yellow fever risk is negligible).
*   **Control Strategy:** If indices are high, **[[Source Reduction]]** (emptying containers, covering tanks) is the primary intervention, followed by chemical control if an outbreak is imminent.

### 💡 Mnemonic: "ABC for Aedes"

To remember the three indices and their denominators:

*   **A** = **A**edes **A**egypti Index is the **H**ouse Index (**H** comes after G, close to A... okay, let's try a better one).
*   **H**ouse Index = **H**ouses / **H**ouses (Numerator is House, Denom is House).
*   **C**ontainer Index = **C**ontainers / **C**ontainers (Numerator is Container, Denom is Container).
*   **B**reteau Index = **B**reeding containers / **B**uildings (Houses). (Numerator is Container, Denom is House).

**Funny Memory Hook:**
*"**H**arry lives in a **H**ouse (**H**ouse index). **C**harlie lives in a **C**ontainer (**C**ontainer Index). But **B**reteau is a **B**east who puts **C**ontainers in everyone's **H**ouse (**B**reteau = **C**ontainers / **H**ouse)."*
