# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Give the species of vector for Kala – Azar

### Vector for Kala-Azar (Visceral Leishmaniasis)

The specific species of vector responsible for transmitting **Kala-Azar** (Visceral Leishmaniasis) in India is the **Sandfly**, specifically the species **[[Phlebotomus argentipes]]**.

While other species like *Phlebotomus papatasii* and *Phlebotomus sergentii* transmit other forms of leishmaniasis (like Oriental Sore/Cutaneous Leishmaniasis), *P. argentipes* is the proven vector for Kala-Azar.

### Key Characteristics of the Vector ([[Phlebotomus argentipes]])

**1. Morphology**
*   **Size:** Smaller than mosquitoes, measuring about 1.5 to 2.5 mm in length.
*   **Appearance:** The body and wings are densely **hairy** (hirsute).
*   **Wings:** Upright, **lanceolate** (flame-shaped) wings that form a "V" shape when at rest.
*   **Legs:** Long and slender, out of proportion to the body size.

**2. Habits and Habitat**
*   **Movement:** They are weak fliers and **hop** rather than fly. They usually cannot fly over long distances and generally stay within 50 yards of their breeding place.
*   **Feeding:** Only the **female** sandflies bite (hematophagous) as they require a blood meal for ovulation. The bite is painful and usually occurs at **night (nocturnal)**.
*   **Breeding Sites:** Unlike mosquitoes, they **do not breed in water**. They breed in damp, dark places containing organic matter, such as **cracks and crevices** in walls/floors, animal sheds, and tree holes.

### Mechanism of Transmission
*   **Mode:** Propagative biological transmission.
*   **Cycle:** The female sandfly picks up the *[[Leishmania donovani]]* parasite (amastigote form) while feeding on an infected person. The parasite develops into the **promastigote** form within the sandfly gut.
*   **Infection:** When the infected sandfly bites a healthy person, it regurgitates the promastigotes into the wound.
*   **Extrinsic Incubation Period:** The parasite takes about **4 to 25 days** to develop within the sandfly before the fly becomes infective.

### Clinical Relevance and Control
*   **Reservoir:** In India, Kala-Azar is considered a non-zoonotic infection, meaning **Man** is the only known reservoir (Anthroponosis).
*   **Vector Control:** Since *P. argentipes* rests indoors (endophilic) and in cracks, the insecticide of choice is **[[DDT]]** (Indoor Residual Spray) up to a height of 6 feet. Sanitation measures like filling cracks and removing organic waste are crucial.

### Mnemonic: The "Argent" Agent
To remember that *Phlebotomus **Argent**ipes* causes Kala-Azar (Black sickness):

**"The Urgent (Argent) Agent Hops in the Dark"**

*   **Argent:** *Phlebotomus argentipes*
*   **Hops:** They hop, don't fly.
*   **Dark:** Nocturnal biters breeding in dark crevices.

OR

**KALA** (Kala-Azar) is carried by **P.A.** (Phlebotomus Argentipes).
