# Plantar Fasciitis (Subcalcaneal Pain)

**Plantar Fasciitis** is a common condition characterized by pain on the plantar surface of the heel. It is considered the most common cause of posterior [[heel pain]]. It typically involves inflammation of the [[plantar aponeurosis]] (plantar fascia) at its attachment on the tuberosity of the [[calcaneum]].

### Etiopathogenesis and Sources of Pain
While often attributed solely to the fascia, the pain may arise from multiple structures in the subcalcaneal region.

**Potential Sources of Pain:**
*   **[[Plantar fascia]]:** Inflammation at the insertion.
*   **Subcalcaneal bursa:** Inflammation of the bursa.
*   **[[Fat pad]]:** Atrophy or insufficiency of the heel pad.
*   **Nerve entrapment:** Compression of the nerve to the [[abductor digiti minimi]] or the medial calcaneal branch of the [[tibial nerve]].
*   **Intrinsic muscles:** Tendinous insertion issues.

**Predisposing Factors:**
*   **Systemic Inflammatory Disorders:** Can be associated with [[gout]], [[ankylosing spondylitis]], and [[Reiter’s disease]].
*   **Biomechanics:** Flat foot ([[pes planus]]) or high arched foot ([[pes cavus]]).
*   **Occupation:** Jobs requiring prolonged standing.

### Clinical Features
**Symptoms:**
*   **Pain:** The hallmark symptom is pain over the ball of the heel.
*   **Start-up Pain:** The pain is characteristically **worst early in the morning** (on taking the first few steps) or after a period of rest (post-static dyskinesia).
*   **Progression:** The pain often improves with mild activity but may worsen after prolonged weight-bearing.

**Signs:**
*   **Tenderness:** Marked tenderness is localized over the **medial aspect of the [[calcaneal tuberosity]]** (the site of attachment of the plantar fascia).
*   **Swelling:** Slight swelling may be palpable at the attachment site.
*   **Passive Stretch:** Passive dorsiflexion of the toes (winding the windlass mechanism) often exaggerates the pain.

### Types of Plantar Fasciitis

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Insertional Plantar Fasciitis** | Also known as **Heel Pain Syndrome**. Pain is localized specifically at the medial calcaneal tubercle. |
| **Diffuse Plantar Fasciitis** | Pain is felt diffusely over the heel and extending into the sole of the foot. |

### Investigations

#### Radiography (X-rays)
*   **Views:** Routine Antero-posterior (AP), Lateral, and Oblique views.
*   **Findings:**
    *   Often normal regarding the fasciitis itself.
    *   **[[Calcaneal Spur]]:** A sharp bony spike projecting forward from the tuberosity of the calcaneum may be seen on the lateral view.

**The Calcaneal Spur Controversy:**
*   **Association, not Causation:** The spur is often an associated finding rather than the primary cause of pain. It represents calcification at the insertion of the plantar fascia or short flexors due to chronic traction (traction osteophyte).
*   **Statistics:**
    *   Approximately **10%** of the general asymptomatic population has heel spurs.
    *   Only **50%** of patients with symptomatic heel pain show spurs on X-ray.
    *   Therefore, the spur has limited therapeutic or prognostic significance.

#### Blood Tests
*   **[[ESR]] and [[Uric Acid]]:** To rule out systemic causes like [[Rheumatoid arthritis]], [[Ankylosing spondylitis]], or [[Gout]], especially in bilateral or recalcitrant cases.

### Treatment
The management is predominantly conservative. Surgery is rarely indicated.

#### I. Conservative Management
**First Line (Acute Phase):**
*   **Rest:** Avoidance of inciting activities (prolonged standing/running).
*   **Analgesics:** [[NSAIDs]] to reduce pain and inflammation.
*   **Heel Pad/Cushion:** Use of a soft heel pad (e.g., Microcellular rubber - MCR) or a heel cup with a hole cut out to relieve pressure on the tender area.
*   **Stretching:** Active stretching exercises for the **[[tendo-Achilles]]** and the **plantar fascia**.

**Second Line (If symptoms persist):**
*   **Local Corticosteroid Injection:** Infiltration of [[hydrocortisone]] into the tender area. (Caution: Risk of fat pad atrophy or fascia rupture with repeated injections).
*   **Orthosis:** Custom-molded foot orthosis to correct biomechanical faults.
*   **Night Splints:** To keep the ankle dorsiflexed and prevent contracture of the fascia during sleep.
*   **Strapping:** Taping the foot to support the arch.

**Third Line (Chronic/Resistant cases):**
*   **Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy ([[ESWT]]):** Application of low-energy shock waves (usually 3 sessions) to stimulate healing.

#### II. Surgical Management
Indicated only if conservative treatment fails after a prolonged period (usually > 6 months).
*   **Plantar Fasciotomy:** Surgical release of the plantar fascia.
*   **Excision of Spur:** Removal of the calcaneal spur (if large and believed to be contributing, though often unnecessary).

### Clinical Implications
*   **Reiter's Disease:** If a young male presents with heel pain (plantar fasciitis) and Achilles tendonitis, always screen for [[Reiter's disease]] or [[Ankylosing Spondylitis]].
*   **Spur Misconception:** Patients often believe the "bone spur" is piercing the flesh. It is crucial to counsel them that the pain is due to soft tissue inflammation (fasciitis) and that the spur is a result, not the cause.

### Mnemonic for Treatment
**H-E-E-L**
*   **H** - **H**eel pads (Visco-elastic/MCR)
*   **E** - **E**xercises (Stretching calf and fascia)
*   **E** - **E**xclude systemic causes (Gout, RA)
*   **L** - **L**ocal steroid injection (if resistant)
