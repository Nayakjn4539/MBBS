# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Sputum smear examination is the method of choice for finding in TB

**Sputum smear examination** is widely considered the **method of choice for case finding** in [[Pulmonary Tuberculosis]] (PTB),.

It is the primary tool used in the [[National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP)]] (formerly RNTCP) because it identifies the most infectious cases—those excreting tubercle bacilli in their sputum—who act as the "pool of infection" in the community,.

### **Why is it the Method of Choice?**
*   **Cost-Effective:** It is cheap, reliable, and easy to perform.
*   ** Epidemiological Significance:** It specifically detects open cases (infectious patients).
*   **Specificity:** It has very high specificity; a positive result is highly indicative of TB.
*   **Speed:** Results can be reported within a day (usually 24 hours),.

### **Technique: Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) Staining**
The standard method used is **Direct Microscopy** using the [[Ziehl-Neelsen stain]].

*   **Principle:** Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an **Acid Fast Bacillus (AFB)**. Once stained with hot carbol fuchsin, it resists decolorization by strong acids (like 25% Sulphuric Acid) due to the high lipid content (**Mycolic Acid**) in its cell wall,.
*   **Appearance:** Under the microscope (oil immersion lens), the bacilli appear as **bright red**, slightly curved, beaded rods against a **blue** background,.
*   **Sensitivity Threshold:** A minimum of **>10,000 bacilli per ml** of sputum is required for a smear to be positive,.

---

### **Sample Collection Strategy**
To ensure high sensitivity (93% detection rate), **two sputum specimens** are required,.

1.  **Spot Sample (Sample A):** Collected on the spot when the patient first presents to the health facility.
2.  **Morning Sample (Sample B):** The patient collects an early morning sample at home the next day (highest bacillary load due to overnight accumulation).

*Note: If the patient comes from a long distance, two spot samples may be taken one hour apart.*

### **Grading of Sputum Smears (RNTCP/NTEP Guidelines)**
The number of bacilli indicates disease severity and infectivity. The laboratory technician examines a minimum of **100 fields**,.

| **Result** | **Observation (under 1000x magnification)** | **Recording/Grading** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Negative** | No AFB seen in 100 oil immersion fields | **0** |
| **Scanty** | 1–9 AFB seen in 100 oil immersion fields | **Scanty (write exact number)** |
| **Positive** | 10–99 AFB in 100 oil immersion fields | **1+** |
| **Positive** | 1–10 AFB per oil immersion field (examine 50 fields) | **2+** |
| **Positive** | >10 AFB per oil immersion field (examine 20 fields) | **3+** |

### **Newer Diagnostic Methods**
While ZN staining is the classic method, the program is upgrading to:
*   **[[LED Fluorescence Microscopy]] (LED-FM):** Uses Auramine-O stain. Bacilli glow yellow against a dark background. It is **more sensitive** (10% higher) and **faster** (larger field of view) than ZN microscopy,.
*   **[[CBNAAT]] (Cartridge Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test):** Also known as GeneXpert. It is now the preferred diagnostic tool for **Presumptive TB cases** among PLHA (People Living with HIV), pediatric cases, and for detecting **Rifampicin resistance**,.

---

### **Clinical Relevance: Diagnostic Algorithm**
*   **Smear Positive:** A patient with at least **one** positive smear is classified as a "Microbiologically Confirmed TB Case" and started on anti-tubercular treatment,,.
*   **Smear Negative:** If smears are negative but clinical suspicion remains, a Chest X-ray (CXR) and/or CBNAAT is advised. A medical officer may then diagnose the patient as "Clinically Diagnosed TB",.

### **Mnemonic**
**"Red Rods Resist Acid"**
*   **Red:** Color of AFB in ZN stain.
*   **Rods:** Shape of the bacilli.
*   **Resist Acid:** Acid-fast nature (Decolorizer is H2SO4).
