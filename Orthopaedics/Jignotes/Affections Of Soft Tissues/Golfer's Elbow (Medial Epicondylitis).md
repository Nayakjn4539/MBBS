# Golfer’s Elbow (Medial Epicondylitis)

### Introduction and Synonyms
**Golfer’s Elbow**, clinically known as **Medial Epicondylitis**, is a condition characterized by pain and inflammation at the origin of the flexor tendons of the forearm. Despite the name, it is seldom caused solely by golf but is associated with activities involving repetitive flexion and pronation.

*   **Synonyms:** [[Epitrochleitis]], [[Medial Tennis Elbow]], [[Swimmer's Elbow]].

### Etiopathogenesis
The condition is an **overuse injury** or degenerative process resulting from repetitive stress on the tendon aponeuroses attached to the [[Medial Epicondyle]] of the [[Humerus]].

*   **Mechanism:** Repetitive microtrauma causes microtears and inflammation in the common flexor origin. The pain is likely due to a vascular repair process similar to rotator cuff tendinitis.
*   **Muscles Involved:** It affects the **Common Flexor Origin**. The specific muscles involved are:
    *   **[[Flexor Carpi Radialis]] (FCR)** (Often the earliest muscle to be affected).
    *   **[[Pronator Teres]]**.
    *   [[Flexor Carpi Ulnaris]] (FCU).
    *   [[Flexor Digitorum Superficialis]] (FDS).
*   **Predisposing Activities:** House painting, carpentry, throwing sports, hammering, and activities involving strenuous wrist movements and forearm muscle contraction.

### Clinical Features
The condition is more common in the **30–50 years** age group.

#### Symptoms
*   **Pain:** Localized over the inner side of the elbow ([[Medial Epicondyle]]).
    *   Pain may radiate down the ulnar side of the forearm.
*   **Aggravating Factors:** Pain is initiated or worsened by gripping, pouring tea, turning a stiff door handle, or lifting weights with the forearm pronated.
*   **Stiffness:** Some morning stiffness may be present.

#### Signs
*   **Tenderness:** Localized tenderness is present just in front of the **[[Medial Epicondyle]]**.
*   **Swelling:** Mild swelling may be noted over the medial aspect.
*   **Elbow Movements:** Flexion and extension range of motion are usually full and painless.

### Special Diagnostic Tests (Provocative Tests)

To confirm the diagnosis, specific maneuvers are used to reproduce the pain at the common flexor origin.

| Test Name | Procedure | Positive Finding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Golfer's Elbow Test]]** (Passive Stretch) | The examiner passively **extends the wrist** and fingers while the forearm is **supinated** and the elbow is extended. | Pain is reproduced over the [[Medial Epicondyle]] due to stretching of the common flexor tendon. |
| **[[Reverse Cozen's Test]]** (Resisted Flexion) | The patient is asked to make a fist and **flex the wrist** against resistance provided by the examiner while the elbow is held in extension. | Severe pain is experienced at the medial epicondyle. |
| **Resisted Pronation Test** | Patient attempts to **pronate** the forearm against resistance. | Pain at the medial aspect of the elbow (implicating the [[Pronator Teres]]). |

### Differential Diagnosis
It is important to differentiate Medial Epicondylitis from other causes of medial elbow pain:
*   **[[Ulnar Neuritis]] / [[Cubital Tunnel Syndrome]]:** Compression of the ulnar nerve behind the medial epicondyle. Check for Tinel’s sign and sensory changes in the little finger.
*   **[[Medial Collateral Ligament]] Injury:** Instability or pain on valgus stress.
*   **Cervical Radiculopathy ([[C8]]-T1):** Referred pain from the neck.

### Treatment

The management protocol is similar to that of [[Tennis Elbow]] (Lateral Epicondylitis).

#### 1. Conservative Management
Most cases respond well to non-operative measures.
*   **Rest:** Avoid precipitating activities (e.g., heavy lifting, forceful gripping).
*   **Medication:** [[Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs]] (NSAIDs) to reduce pain and inflammation.
*   **Physiotherapy:**
    *   Ultrasonic therapy.
    *   Stretching and strengthening exercises for flexor-pronator muscles.
*   **Orthotics:** Use of a **[[Counterforce Brace]]** (Medial epicondylitis clasp) to offload the tendon insertion.
*   **Local Injection:** In resistant cases, a local injection of **[[Hydrocortisone]]** (Corticosteroid) mixed with local anesthetic into the area of maximum tenderness often brings relief.
    *   *Caution:* Avoid injection into the ulnar nerve.

#### 2. Operative Management
Surgery is rarely indicated and reserved for refractory cases that fail to respond to conservative treatment for months.
*   **Procedure:** Surgical release of the common flexor origin. The affected common tendon is detached from its origin at the [[Medial Epicondyle]] and degenerated tissue is excised.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Ulnar Nerve Proximity:** The [[Ulnar Nerve]] runs in the cubital tunnel just posterior to the medial epicondyle. Inflammation or surgical intervention in this area carries a risk of ulnar nerve irritation or injury. Always assess ulnar nerve function before and after treatment.
*   **"Little League Elbow":** In children and adolescents involved in throwing sports, medial elbow pain may represent a **[[Medial Epicondyle Avulsion Fracture]]**, not simple tendinitis.

### Mnemonic for Muscles Involved
**"Pass Fail, Pass Fail"** (Muscles arising from Common Flexor Origin)
*   **P**ronator Teres
*   **F**lexor Carpi Radialis
*   **P**almaris Longus
*   **F**lexor Carpi Ulnaris
*(Note: Golfer's elbow primarily affects FCR and Pronator Teres).*
