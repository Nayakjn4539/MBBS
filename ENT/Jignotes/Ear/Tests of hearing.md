# [[Ear]] > Tests of hearing

### Classification of Hearing Tests

Hearing tests are broadly classified based on the methodology and the involvement of the patient's subjective response.

1.  **Clinical / Bedside Tests** (Subjective)
    *   Finger Friction Test, Watch Test
    *   Speech (Voice) Tests
    *   [[Tuning Fork]] Tests
2.  **Audiometric Tests**
    *   **Subjective Tests:** [[Pure Tone Audiometry]] (PTA), [[Speech Audiometry]], Bekesy Audiometry.
    *   **Objective Tests:** [[Impedance Audiometry]] (Tympanometry, Acoustic Reflex), [[Otoacoustic Emissions]] (OAE), [[Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry]] (BERA/ABR), [[Electrocochleography]] (ECochG), [[Auditory Steady State Response]] (ASSR).

### I. Clinical / Bedside Tests

These are screening tests used to differentiate between [[Conductive Hearing Loss]] (CHL) and [[Sensorineural Hearing Loss]] (SNHL).

#### 1. Voice Tests (Speech Tests)
*   **Method:** The patient stands 6 meters away. The non-test ear is masked by tragal rubbing. The examiner uses spondee words (e.g., "blackboard") or numbers.
*   **Findings:**
    *   **Whisper:** Normal hearing distance is 6 meters (20 ft).
    *   **Conversational Voice:** Normal hearing distance is 12 meters.

#### 2. Tuning Fork Tests (TFT)
*   **Frequency:** Ideally **512 Hz** is used. It falls within the speech frequency range, has less overtone, and has a longer decay time.
    *   Lower frequencies (128, 256 Hz) produce more vibration sense (better felt than heard).
    *   Higher frequencies (1024, 2048 Hz) decay too quickly.

**Summary of Tuning Fork Tests Findings:**

| Test | Normal Ear | Conductive Hearing Loss (CHL) | Sensorineural Hearing Loss (SNHL) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Rinne's Test]]**<br>(Compares AC vs BC) | **Positive**<br>(AC > BC) | **Negative**<br>(BC > AC) | **Positive**<br>(AC > BC, but both reduced) |
| **[[Weber's Test]]**<br>(Lateralization) | **No Lateralization**<br>(Central) | **Lateralizes to Worse Ear**<br>(Disease side) | **Lateralizes to Better Ear**<br>(Healthy side) |
| **[[Absolute Bone Conduction]] (ABC)**<br>(Compare with Examiner) | **Same as Examiner** | **Same as Examiner** | **Reduced / Shortened** |
| **[[Schwabach's Test]]**<br>(Meatus Open) | **Equal** | **Lengthened** | **Shortened** |
| **[[Bing Test]]**<br>(Occlusion Effect) | **Positive**<br>(Louder when occluded) | **Negative**<br>(No change) | **Positive**<br>(Louder when occluded) |
| **[[Gelle's Test]]**<br>(Pressure via Siegel's) | **Positive**<br>(Hearing decreases) | **Negative**<br>(No change - e.g., Otosclerosis) | **Positive**<br>(Hearing decreases) |

**Clinical Implications & Mnemonics:**
*   **Rinne's Test:**
    *   **False Negative Rinne:** Seen in severe unilateral SNHL. The patient hears BC through the opposite (healthy) ear via transcranial transmission. Rule out by masking or Weber's test.
    *   *Interpretation:* A negative Rinne with 256 Hz implies ~15 dB loss; with 512 Hz implies ~30-45 dB loss.
*   **Weber's Test:**
    *   Mnemonic for Lateralization: **SOCS** (**S**NHL to **O**pposite; **C**HL to **S**ame) or **We Create Best Students** (**We**ber: **C**onductive=**B**ad ear; **S**ensorineural=**S**ound ear/Good ear).
*   **Gelle's Test:** Specifically tests for ossicular fixation (e.g., [[Otosclerosis]]). If stapes is fixed, increasing pressure won't dampen the sound (Negative result).

### II. Subjective Audiometric Tests

#### 1. Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA)
*   **Principle:** Measures the threshold of hearing for Air Conduction (AC) and Bone Conduction (BC) at various frequencies (250–8000 Hz).
*   **The [[Audiogram]]:** A graph plotting intensity (dB) against frequency (Hz).
    *   **Right Ear:** Red Circle (**O**)
    *   **Left Ear:** Blue Cross (**X**).
*   **Masking:** Used when the difference between ears exceeds 40 dB (AC) or 0 dB (BC) to prevent "shadow curves" from the non-test ear.

**Interpretation of PTA:**

| Condition | AC Threshold | BC Threshold | Air-Bone Gap (AB Gap) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Normal** | < 25 dB | < 25 dB | Insignificant |
| **Conductive Loss** | Elevated (> 25 dB) | Normal | **Present (> 15 dB)** |
| **Sensorineural Loss** | Elevated | Elevated | Absent / Insignificant |
| **Mixed Loss** | Elevated | Elevated | **Present** (AC worse than BC) |

**Diagnostic Curves:**
*   **[[Carhart's Notch]]:** Dip in **Bone Conduction** at **2000 Hz**. Seen in **Otosclerosis**.
*   **Acoustic Dip (Boiler's Notch):** Dip in **AC and BC** at **4000 Hz**. Seen in [[Noise Induced Hearing Loss]].
*   **Cookie Bite Curve (U-shaped):** Mid-frequency loss. Seen in congenital SNHL.
*   **Down-sloping Curve:** High-frequency loss. Mnemonic **POND** (Presbycusis, Ototoxicity, Noise trauma, Disease).
*   **Up-sloping Curve:** Low-frequency loss. Early [[Meniere's Disease]].

#### 2. Speech Audiometry
*   **Speech Reception Threshold (SRT):** Minimum intensity to hear 50% of **Spondee words** (two-syllable words with equal stress, e.g., "Baseball"). SRT should be within 10 dB of PTA average.
*   **Speech Discrimination Score (SDS):** Ability to understand **Phonetically Balanced (PB)** words at suprathreshold levels.
    *   **Normal/CHL:** 90–100% score.
    *   **Cochlear SNHL:** ~70% (Reduced).
    *   **Retrocochlear (Neural):** Very poor score (0-40%).
    *   **Rollover Phenomenon:** SDS *decreases* as sound intensity increases (Paradoxical). Specific for **Retrocochlear** lesions (e.g., [[Acoustic Neuroma]]).

### III. Objective Audiometric Tests

#### 1. Impedance Audiometry
Comprises Tympanometry and Acoustic Reflex testing.

**A. [[Tympanometry]]:**
Measures the compliance (mobility) of the tympanic membrane (TM) and middle ear pressure.

| Curve Type | Shape | Interpretation | Clinical Condition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type A** | Peak at 0 daPa | Normal pressure/compliance | Normal Ear |
| **Type As** | Shallow Peak | Reduced compliance (Stiff) | [[Otosclerosis]], Fixation |
| **Type Ad** | Deep/Tall Peak | Hyper-compliance (Flaccid) | Ossicular Discontinuity |
| **Type B** | Flat (No peak) | No mobility / Fluid | [[Otitis Media with Effusion]] (Glue Ear), Perforation (High volume) |
| **Type C** | Peak at negative | Negative pressure | Eustachian Tube Dysfunction |

**B. Acoustic Reflex (Stapedial Reflex):**
*   Contraction of the stapedius muscle in response to loud sounds (70–100 dB above threshold).
*   **Absent in:** Facial nerve palsy (proximal to nerve to stapedius), severe SNHL, conductive loss.
*   **Recruitment:** Reflex present at low sensation levels (<60 dB above threshold) indicates **Cochlear pathology** (Meniere's).
*   **Reflex Decay:** Amplitude drops by 50% within 10 seconds. Sign of **Retrocochlear** pathology (Nerve fatigue).

#### 2. Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE)
Sounds generated by the **Outer Hair Cells** (OHC) of the cochlea.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Spontaneous (SOAE):** Present in only 50% of normals.
    *   **Evoked:**
        *   **Transient Evoked (TEOAE):** Best for **Screening** neonates.
        *   **Distortion Product (DPOAE):** Specific frequencies. Early detection of **Ototoxicity** and **Noise trauma**.
*   **Clinical Use:** Screening infants (PASS/REFER), Malingering, differentiating Cochlear (OAE absent) vs Retrocochlear (OAE present) lesions.

#### 3. Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry (BERA / ABR)
Records electrical potentials from the auditory nerve and brainstem.
*   **Waves:** I to V (originating from distal nerve to Inferior Colliculus).
*   **Wave V:** Most robust and clinically useful.
*   **Uses:**
    *   Threshold estimation in infants/uncooperative patients.
    *   **Retrocochlear Pathology:** Inter-aural Wave V latency difference > 0.2 ms indicates [[Acoustic Neuroma]] (Vestibular Schwannoma).
    *   **Mnemonic for Wave Origin (ECOLI):** **E**ighth nerve, **C**ochlear nucleus, **O**livary complex, **L**ateral lemniscus, **I**nferior colliculus.

#### 4. Electrocochleography (ECochG)
*   Measures electrical potentials of the cochlea (SP: Summating Potential, AP: Action Potential).
*   **Finding:** Increased **SP/AP ratio (>30-45%)** is diagnostic for **Meniere’s Disease** (Endolymphatic Hydrops).

### IV. Special Tests (Site of Lesion)

Used to differentiate **Cochlear** (Sensory) from **Retrocochlear** (Neural) lesions.

| Test | Cochlear (e.g., Meniere's) | Retrocochlear (e.g., Acoustic Neuroma) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Recruitment** | Present (Positive) | Absent |
| **SISI Test** | High Score (70-100%) | Low Score (0-20%) |
| **Tone Decay** | Negative (< 15-20 dB decay) | **Positive** (> 30 dB decay - Nerve Fatigue) |
| **ABLB** | Recruitment present | No recruitment |
| **Bekesy** | Type II curve | Type III or IV curve |

### V. Tests for Non-Organic Hearing Loss (Malingering)
*   **Stenger’s Test:** Best for unilateral malingering. Based on the principle that two identical tones are presented, only the louder one is heard.
*   **Lombard Test:** Based on the reflex increase in voice intensity when background noise increases.
*   **Chimani-Moos Test:** Variation of Weber's test.
*   **Objective Tests:** BERA and OAE are definitive for confirming thresholds.
