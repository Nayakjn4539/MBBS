# Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) in ENT

**Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT)** is a medical treatment involving the intermittent inhalation of 100% oxygen in chambers pressurized above 1 atmosphere absolute (ATA). It serves as a significant adjuvant therapy in various Otorhinolaryngological conditions, particularly those involving ischemia, infection, and neural damage.

### Principle and Physics
*   **Definition:** Administration of 100% oxygen at a pressure greater than sea level pressure (1 ATA = 760 mm Hg).
*   **Method:** The patient is placed in a hyperbaric chamber where the pressure is raised to **2.0–2.5 ATA**,.
*   **Physiological Basis:**
    *   Normally, hemoglobin is saturated (97%) at atmospheric pressure.
    *   Under hyperbaric conditions, a significant amount of oxygen dissolves directly into the **plasma** (Henry's Law), bypassing the hemoglobin limit.

### Mechanism of Action
HBOT exerts its therapeutic effects through multiple pathways:
1.  **Increases Oxygen Tension:**
    *   It raises the partial pressure of oxygen ($pO_2$) in the [[perilymph]] and [[endolymph]] by up to **460%**.
    *   This oxygen supplies the **inner hair cells** and stria vascularis via diffusion.
    *   Elevated $pO_2$ levels remain 60% above normal for up to 1 hour after therapy termination.
2.  **Hemorheological Effect:**
    *   Reduces **hematocrit** and decreases **blood viscosity**,.
    *   Improves microcirculation and diffusion of oxygen to ischemic cells,.
3.  **Radiosensitization:**
    *   Hypoxic cells are radioresistant. HBOT increases the oxygenation of the tumor core, making malignant cells more sensitive to **ionizing radiation**.
    *   It promotes neovascularization in hypoxic areas.
4.  **Antimicrobial and Healing:**
    *   Enhances leukocyte function and phagocytic activity.
    *   Effective against anaerobic bacteria (e.g., in osteomyelitis).

### Indications in ENT and Head & Neck Surgery

The **Undersea & Hyperbaric Medicine Society (UHMS)** has approved several indications relevant to ENT,:

#### 1. Otology
*   **Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss ([[SSNHL]]):**
    *   HBOT is used as an adjunctive therapy to steroids and vasodilators.
    *   **Rationale:** Activates cell metabolism and restores ionic balance in the cochlea.
    *   **Patient Selection:** Patients with moderate to profound loss ($\geq$ 41 dB) presenting within **14 days** of symptom onset benefit the most.
*   **Malignant Otitis Externa ([[MOE]]):**
    *   Used as an adjuvant to antimicrobials, particularly in refractory cases involving necrotizing soft tissue damage,,.
*   **Acute Acoustic Trauma:**
    *   Used for noise-induced hearing loss to mitigate temporary or permanent threshold shifts.
*   **Decompression Sickness:**
    *   Treats inner ear barotrauma or "staggers" caused by nitrogen bubbles in the inner ear or brainstem,.

#### 2. Head and Neck Oncology
*   **Osteoradionecrosis:**
    *   Used for the treatment of radiation-induced tissue damage, particularly in the mandible or temporal bone,.
*   **Radiosensitizer:**
    *   Administered prior to radiation therapy to improve tumor kill rates in head and neck cancers.
*   **Compromised Flaps/Grafts:**
    *   Aids in the survival of compromised skin grafts and flaps.

#### 3. Infections
*   **Intracranial Abscess:** Otogenic brain abscesses.
*   **Refractory Osteomyelitis:** Of the skull base or mandible.

### Clinical Management and Protocol

> Flowchart showing the sequence of HBOT session: Compression (10-15 mins) -> Oxygen inhalation at plateau pressure (60-90 mins) -> Decompression (10-15 mins)

| Parameter | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Gas Mixture** | 100% Oxygen |
| **Pressure** | 2.0 to 2.5 ATA |
| **Duration** | 90 minutes daily |
| **Frequency** | 10–20 sessions (variable based on response), |
| **Compression/Decompression** | 10–15 minutes each phase |

### Complications and Safety
While generally safe, placing a patient in a pressurized chamber carries risks:
1.  **Otitic Barotrauma:**
    *   Damage to the **tympanic membrane** or middle ear due to failure to equalize pressure during compression/decompression.
    *   *Prevention:* Myringotomy or tympanostomy tubes may be required if Eustachian tube function is poor.
2.  **Oxygen Toxicity:** Potential CNS toxicity (seizures) or pulmonary toxicity due to high-pressure oxygen.
3.  **Claustrophobia:** Due to the confined space of the chamber.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Window of Opportunity:** In **Sudden SNHL**, the "time is tissue." Evidence supports use within the first **2 weeks** of symptom onset. Delayed presentation reduces efficacy.
*   **Cost-Benefit:** Although HBOT is expensive, minimizing the burden of hearing loss (social isolation, job performance) often outweighs the treatment costs.
*   **Radiotherapy Adjunct:** In advanced cancers with necrotic cores (anoxic cells), HBOT combined with conventional irradiation can enhance therapeutic outcomes.

### Mnemonic
**Indications for HBOT in ENT: "MORE S"**
*   **M**alignant Otitis Externa
*   **O**steoradionecrosis
*   **R**adiosensitizer
*   **E**mbolism (Air/Gas) / Decompression sickness
*   **S**udden Sensorineural Hearing Loss
