# Keratoconus and Ectatic Disorders

## 1. Keratoconus (Conical Cornea)

### Definition
Keratoconus is a non-inflammatory, bilateral (85%), progressive ectatic condition of the [[cornea]] in its axial part. It usually starts at puberty and progresses slowly,,.

### Etiology and Pathogenesis
*   **Etiology:** Multifactorial involving heredity, developmental defects, and endocrine factors.
*   **Pathogenesis:** Defective synthesis of mucopolysaccharides and collagen tissue leads to progressive thinning and ectasia of the central or paracentral cornea.
*   **Genetics:** Can be Autosomal Dominant or Recessive.

### Associations
Keratoconus is frequently associated with systemic and ocular conditions:
*   **Systemic:**
    *   [[Down syndrome]],.
    *   [[Marfan syndrome]],.
    *   [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]],.
    *   [[Osteogenesis imperfecta]].
    *   Atopy (Asthma, Eczema, Hay fever).
*   **Ocular:**
    *   [[Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis]] (VKC),.
    *   [[Blue sclera]].
    *   [[Retinitis Pigmentosa]].
    *   [[Ectopia lentis]].
    *   [[Aniridia]].
    *   Leber's congenital amaurosis.

**Mnemonic for Associations:** **DOWN** with **MAR**s **AT** **E**ight
*   **DOWN**s syndrome
*   **MAR**fan's syndrome
*   **AT**opy (VKC, Asthma)
*   **E**hlers-Danlos

### Clinical Features
**Symptoms:**
*   Defective vision due to progressive **myopia** and **irregular astigmatism**,.
*   Frequent change of glasses.
*   Visual distortion, glare, and halos around lights,.
*   Monocular diplopia or polyopia,.

**Signs:**
These are critical for diagnosis, often requiring slit-lamp examination and other tools.

1.  **Direct Ophthalmoscopy:**
    *   **Oil Droplet Reflex:** An annular dark shadow separates the central and peripheral areas (Charleaux sign),.
2.  **Retinoscopy:**
    *   **Yawning or Scissoring Reflex:** The red reflex appears to split like a pair of scissors closing,,.
3.  **Slit-Lamp Examination:**
    *   **Stromal Thinning:** Central or paracentral (usually inferior to center),.
    *   **[[Fleischer’s Ring]]:** A brownish ring at the base of the cone due to **iron deposition** in the epithelium (best seen with cobalt blue filter),,,.
    *   **[[Vogt’s Striae]]:** Fine, vertical, deep stromal stress lines that disappear on digital pressure,,.
    *   **Prominent Corneal Nerves:** Visible due to corneal thinning,.
4.  **External/Profile Signs:**
    *   **[[Munson’s Sign]]:** Localized V-shaped bulging of the lower lid when the patient looks down,,,.
    *   **[[Rizzuti’s Sign]]:** When light is shone from the temporal side, it focuses as a bright arrowhead pattern on the nasal limbus,.

### Morphological Classification
Based on the shape and size of the cone,:
| Type | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Nipple Cone** | Small size (<5 mm), steep curvature, central. |
| **Oval Cone** | Larger (5–6 mm), ellipsoid, displaced inferotemporally. |
| **Globus Cone** | Very large (>6 mm), involves over 75% of cornea. |

### Complications: Acute Hydrops
*   **Pathogenesis:** Sudden rupture of [[Descemet’s membrane]] leads to influx of aqueous humor into the stroma,.
*   **Presentation:** Sudden onset of corneal edema, marked defective vision, pain, photophobia, and lacrimation.
*   **Outcome:** Usually heals with scarring (Leucoma), which may flatten the cornea but reduces vision if central,.

### Investigations
1.  **[[Corneal Topography]] (Videokeratography):** The most sensitive method for detecting early keratoconus (*Forme Fruste*). It shows steepening of the cornea (usually inferior),,.
2.  **[[Keratometry]]:** Shows irregular astigmatism and high K values (>48 D is mild, >54 D is severe). Mires appear distorted/pulsating,,.
3.  **[[Pachymetry]]:** Demonstrates corneal thinning,.

### Management
**Optical Management:**
1.  **Spectacles:** Useful only in very early stages.
2.  **Contact Lenses:**
    *   **Rigid Gas Permeable (RGP) Lenses:** Mainstay for visual rehabilitation as they mask irregular astigmatism,.
    *   **Scleral Lenses (e.g., Rose-K):** For moderate to advanced cases.

**Surgical Management:**
1.  **[[Corneal Collagen Cross-Linking]] (C3R/CXL):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Uses **Riboflavin (Vitamin B2)** drops and **UV-A radiation** (370 nm) to form covalent bonds between collagen fibrils.
    *   **Indication:** To **halt the progression** of the disease (Best initial treatment for progressive cases),,,.
2.  **Intrastromal Corneal Ring Segments ([[INTACS]]):**
    *   PMMA rings inserted into stroma to flatten the central cornea,.
3.  **[[Keratoplasty]] (Corneal Transplantation):**
    *   Indicated when contact lenses fail or in presence of apical scarring.
    *   **Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty ([[DALK]]):** Preferred if endothelium is healthy (reduces rejection risk),.
    *   **Penetrating Keratoplasty ([[PK]]):** Full-thickness graft,,.

## 2. Keratoglobus
A rare, congenital, non-progressive ectatic disorder.

*   **Features:** Bilateral hemispherical protrusion and thinning of the **entire cornea** (limbus to limbus),.
*   **Genetics:** Familial, Autosomal Recessive.
*   **Difference from Buphthalmos:** In Keratoglobus, IOP is normal, angle is normal, and there is no optic disc cupping,.
*   **Associations:** [[Blue sclera]], Leber's congenital amaurosis, [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]],.
*   **Risk:** Extremely thin cornea is highly susceptible to rupture with mild trauma.

---

## 3. Pellucid Marginal Degeneration (PMD)
A bilateral, non-inflammatory ectatic condition.

*   **Site:** Painless thinning of the **inferior peripheral cornea** (typically 4 to 8 o'clock position),.
*   **Presentation:** The cornea *above* the area of thinning protrudes, causing high **against-the-rule astigmatism**,.
*   **Signs:** No lipid deposition or vascularization (unlike Terrien's marginal degeneration).
*   **Topography:** Classic "Crab-claw" or "Kissing birds" pattern.

---

## 4. Posterior Keratoconus
*   **Features:** Extremely rare condition characterized by focal thinning and indentation of the **posterior surface** of the cornea, while the anterior surface remains normal.
*   **Course:** Non-progressive.

**Clinical Implication:**
In a young patient presenting with frequent changes in glasses and high cylinder power, always suspect **Keratoconus**. Perform a **Corneal Topography** early. Avoid LASIK in these patients as it can precipitate corneal ectasia.
