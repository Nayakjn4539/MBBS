# [[Lower Limb]] > March Fracture

### March Fracture (Stress Fracture)

#### Definition
A **March Fracture** is a specific type of [[stress fracture]] or [[fatigue fracture]] occurring in the shaft of the [[metatarsal bones]], most commonly affecting the **2nd or 3rd metatarsal**.
*   It occurs in **normal bone** of a healthy patient due to unaccustomed or repetitive loading/stress rather than a single specific traumatic incident.
*   **Eponym Origin:** It is termed "March fracture" because it was historically and commonly observed in new army recruits/soldiers after long route marches.

#### Etiology and Risk Factors
The condition is caused by rhythmical, repetitive sub-threshold trauma that causes a break in the [[bony trabeculae]].

**Commonly affected groups:**
*   **Soldiers** (classic presentation).
*   **Athletes** (runners).
*   **Ballet dancers**.
*   **Nurses** and **Doctors** (due to prolonged standing/walking).
*   **Policemen**.

**Sites of Stress Fractures (Summary Table)**
| Fracture Type/Location | Population/Cause |
| :--- | :--- |
| **March Fracture (2nd/3rd Metatarsal)** | Soldiers, Hikers |
| **Runner’s Fracture (Distal Fibula)** | Long-distance runners |
| **Proximal Tibia** | Athletes |
| **Femoral Neck** | Military recruits, elderly (insufficiency fracture) |
| **Pars Interarticularis (L5)** | Gymnasts, fast bowlers |

#### Clinical Features
The onset is usually **gradual or insidious** rather than acute.
*   **Pain:** The primary symptom. It typically increases with activity/exercise and is relieved by rest.
*   **Local Tenderness:** Significant tenderness is elicited directly over the metatarsal shaft.
*   **Swelling:** Localized swelling over the forefoot/dorsum of the foot.
*   **Thickening:** A palpable thickening of the bone (callus) may be felt in later stages.

> **Clinical Implication:** A [[stress fracture]] is often missed during the initial examination because the history of specific trauma is absent and initial X-rays are often negative. A high index of suspicion is required in patients with foot pain after increased physical activity.

#### Diagnostic Imaging
**1. Plain Radiography (X-ray)**
*   **1st Week:** Often **negative**. No fracture line is detected.
*   **2nd – 3rd Week:** A faint, transverse, undisplaced hairline fracture may become visible.
*   **Key Feature:** The zone of [[callus]] (periosteal reaction) surrounding the fracture is often more striking and significant than the fracture line itself.

**2. Bone Scan (Radionuclide Scanning)**
*   Great help in determining the presence of a stress fracture.
*   Shows increased uptake ("hot spots") at the site of the lesion.
*   Can detect pathology earlier than plain X-rays (within 24-48 hours).

**3. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)**
*   **Investigation of Choice (IOC):** It is highly sensitive and can detect [[bone marrow edema]] and occult fractures before they are visible on X-ray.

#### Management
The fracture is generally **stable**, and the mainstay of treatment is conservative.

**Conservative Treatment:**
1.  **Rest:** Avoidance of the painful activity is crucial.
2.  **Support:** Application of an **elastic bandage**.
3.  **Immobilization:**
    *   Usually, rest and support suffice.
    *   A [[plaster cast]] (below knee) may be required for 3–4 weeks if the pain is severe or if the patient is non-compliant.
4.  **Rehabilitation:** Gradual return to activity once the lesion heals.

**Note on Healing:**
*   Healing can take many months.
*   Enforced inactivity is often difficult for high-demand athletes/soldiers to accept, but is necessary to prevent complete fracture or non-union.

#### Differential Diagnosis
*   **Jones Fracture:** Fracture of the base of the 5th metatarsal (specifically Zone 2). This is distinct from a March fracture (2nd/3rd metatarsal) and has a higher risk of non-union.
*   **Metatarsalgia:** General pain in the metatarsal region.
*   **Osteosarcoma:** Occasionally, the healing callus of a stress fracture can mimic the histological or radiological appearance of a tumor (e.g., [[osteosarcoma]]), leading to diagnostic confusion.
