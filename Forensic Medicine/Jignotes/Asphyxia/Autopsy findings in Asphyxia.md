# [[Asphyxia]] > Autopsy findings in Asphyxia

### **Autopsy Findings in Asphyxia**

Asphyxia is a condition caused by interference with the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the body. While specific types of asphyxia (like hanging or strangulation) have unique local findings, there are general pathological changes common to most asphyxial deaths.

These general signs are non-specific and can appear in other modes of death (like cardiac failure), but their collective presence strongly suggests [[Asphyxia]].

### **The Classic Signs (Asphyxial Triad/Quintet)**

Classically, the findings are grouped into a triad, sometimes expanded to a quintet:
1.  **Cyanosis** (Bluish discoloration)
2.  **Petechial Hemorrhages** ([[Tardieu Spots]])
3.  **Visceral Congestion**
4.  **Postmortem Fluidity of Blood** (Dark and fluid)
5.  **Right Ventricular Enlargement** (Cardiac dilation)

### **1. External Findings**

These are the signs observed on the surface of the body during the preliminary examination.

*   **Face and Head:**
    *   **Cyanosis:** The face usually appears **deeply congested**, distorted, swollen, and edematous. The color ranges from blue to deep purple (due to an increase in reduced hemoglobin >5g/100ml).
    *   **Petechiae:** Pinpoint hemorrhages seen on the forehead, behind the ears, and eyelids.
    *   **Eyes:** The eyeballs may be prominent or bulging. The conjunctivae are congested with **subconjunctival hemorrhages**.
    *   **Nose and Mouth:** Bloody froth (a mixture of air, mucus, and blood) may exude from the nostrils and mouth. The tongue is often swollen, congested (dark purple), and **protruded**. It may show bite marks (between clamped teeth).

*   **Postmortem Staining ([[Livor Mortis]]):**
    *   **Color:** Usually dark bluish-purple or violet.
    *   **Onset:** Appears early and is more intense due to the fluidity of blood.
    *   **Location:** In hanging, it appears in a "glove and stocking" distribution (lower limbs and hands) due to gravity.

*   **Rigor Mortis:**
    *   Generally sets in **early** and passes off early (due to violent convulsions and exhaustion of ATP before death).
    *   Rarely, [[Cadaveric Spasm]] may be seen (e.g., grass/weeds in hand in drowning cases).

*   **Sphincter Relaxation:**
    *   Involuntary discharge of urine and feces is common due to relaxation of sphincters during the agonal phase.
    *   **Seminal emission** may be present (non-specific, can occur in other deaths too).

### **2. Internal Findings**

Upon dissection, the internal organs reflect the physiological struggle against hypoxia and venous stasis.

*   **Blood:**
    *   The blood is usually **dark** (due to excess CO2) and **fluid** (due to release of fibrinolysins).
    *   *Note:* While traditional teaching emphasizes fluidity, modern pathology suggests this is due to fibrinolysis and is non-specific to asphyxia.

*   **Respiratory System ([[Lungs]]):**
    *   **Congestion:** The lungs are heavy, voluminous, and deeply congested (dark red/purple).
    *   **Edema:** On cutting, a mix of blood and frothy fluid oozes out.
    *   **Hemorrhages:** [[Tardieu spots]] (sub-pleural petechiae) are classically seen, especially in the interlobar fissures and at the back of the lungs.
    *   **Mucosa:** The larynx, trachea, and bronchi are congested and contain bloody froth.

*   **Cardiovascular System ([[Heart]]):**
    *   **Right Side:** The right atrium and ventricle are typically **distended** and engorged with dark fluid blood (due to pulmonary hypertension and venous stasis).
    *   **Left Side:** Usually empty or contains very little blood.
    *   **Hemorrhages:** Sub-epicardial petechiae (Tardieu spots) are often found on the posterior surface of the heart.

*   **Abdominal Organs:**
    *   There is generalized **venous congestion** of all abdominal viscera (Liver, Spleen, Kidneys).
    *   The stomach mucosa may show congestion.

*   **Brain and Meninges:**
    *   The meninges are congested.
    *   The brain is edematous and heavy.
    *   Cut sections of the brain (white matter) may show punctiform hemorrhages (**Brain purpura**).

### **3. Specific Entity: Tardieu Spots**

*   **Definition:** These are minute, pinpoint, distinct, round, purpuric hemorrhages.
*   **Mechanism:** They are caused by the **acute rise in venous pressure** (mechanical obstruction to venous return) leading to the rupture of capillaries and venules. They are *not* caused directly by hypoxia.
*   **Common Locations:**
    *   Sub-conjunctival (eyes).
    *   Sub-pleural (lungs).
    *   Sub-epicardial (heart).
    *   Under the scalp.
*   **Significance:** While associated with asphyxia, they can also occur in non-asphyxial deaths (e.g., bleeding diathesis, coronary thrombosis).

### **Summary Table: Autopsy Findings**

| Feature | Findings in Asphyxia |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Face** | Cyanosed, swollen, congested. |
| **Eyes** | Bulging, subconjunctival hemorrhages. |
| **Tongue** | Swollen, protruded, bitten. |
| **Blood** | Dark, fluid, unclotted. |
| **Lungs** | Congested, edematous, Tardieu spots (subpleural). |
| **Heart** | Right side distended; Left side empty. |
| **Viscera** | Generalized congestion. |
| **Rigor Mortis** | Early onset. |

### **Medicolegal Aspects**

1.  **Non-Specificity:** The "classic signs" of asphyxia (congestion, cyanosis, petechiae) are **not diagnostic**. They can be seen in deaths due to cardiac failure, status epilepticus, or even natural decomposition.
2.  **Diagnosis of Exclusion:** Asphyxia is often a diagnosis of exclusion unless specific signs of mechanical interference (e.g., ligature mark in [[Hanging]], fracture of [[Hyoid bone]] in throttling) are found.
3.  **Role of Alcohol/Drugs:** Always rule out intoxication which may have contributed to positional asphyxia or inability to escape choking.
4.  **Sexual Asphyxia:** In cases of solitary accidental hanging/strangulation, look for evidence of [[Autoerotic Asphyxia]] (padding on neck, pornography, bondage).

### **Mnemonic**

To remember the findings, think of **"OXYGEN"**:

*   **O** - **O**ozing of blood (Dark fluid blood).
*   **X** - e**X**pulsion of urine/feces (Sphincter relaxation).
*   **Y** - c**Y**anosis (Face/Nails).
*   **G** - **G**orged Right Heart (Right ventricular distension).
*   **E** - **E**dema of Lungs.
*   **N** - **N**umerous Petechiae ([[Tardieu spots]]).
