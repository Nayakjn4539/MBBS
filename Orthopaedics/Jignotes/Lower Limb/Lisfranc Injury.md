# [[Lower Limb]] > Lisfranc Injury

### Lisfranc Injury (Tarsometatarsal Injury)

**Definition**
A [[Lisfranc injury]] refers to a fracture-dislocation or ligamentous disruption at the **tarsometatarsal joint complex**. It involves the articulation between the midfoot ([[cuneiforms]] and [[cuboid]]) and the forefoot ([[metatarsals]]).

**Relevant Anatomy**
*   **The Keystone:** The base of the [[2nd metatarsal]] is recessed between the medial and lateral cuneiforms, locking the joint like a keystone in a Roman arch. This provides intrinsic stability.
*   **Lisfranc Ligament:** A strong interosseous ligament connecting the **medial cuneiform** to the base of the **2nd metatarsal**.
*   **Lack of Transverse Ligament:** There is **no** transverse metatarsal ligament connecting the base of the 1st metatarsal to the 2nd metatarsal. This makes this area prone to separation (diastasis).

### Mechanism of Injury

| Type | Description | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Direct Injury** | A heavy object falls directly onto the dorsum of the foot or a crush injury. | Industrial accidents, crush injuries. |
| **Indirect Injury** | (More common) Longitudinal force applied to a plantarflexed foot. Often involves twisting/rotation. | Stumbling, falling from a height, sports (e.g., foot fixed in stirrup while falling off a horse, football). |

### Clinical Features
*   **Pain:** Severe pain in the midfoot, difficulty or inability to bear weight.
*   **Swelling:** Significant swelling over the dorsum of the foot.
*   **Deformity:** May be subtle or obvious depending on the displacement.
*   **Plantar Ecchymosis:** Bruising on the sole of the foot (midfoot area) is highly suggestive of a Lisfranc injury.
*   **Tenderness:** Palpable tenderness over the tarsometatarsal joints.

### Classification (Quenu and Kuss / Hardcastle)
Based on the direction of displacement of the metatarsals:

1.  **Type A (Homolateral/Total Incongruity):**
    *   All five [[metatarsals]] are displaced in the **same direction** (usually laterally).
2.  **Type B (Isolated/Partial Incongruity):**
    *   One or more metatarsals are displaced, while others remain in place.
    *   *Example:* Only the 1st metatarsal displaced medially or only lateral metatarsals displaced laterally.
3.  **Type C (Divergent):**
    *   The 1st metatarsal is displaced medially, and the lateral metatarsals (2nd–5th) are displaced laterally.

### Diagnosis and Imaging

**1. Plain Radiographs (X-rays)**
Standard views: AP, Lateral, and 30° Oblique. Weight-bearing views (if tolerated) are crucial to reveal subtle instability.

*   **AP View:** The medial border of the **2nd metatarsal** should align perfectly with the medial border of the **middle (intermediate) cuneiform**.
*   **Oblique View:** The medial border of the **4th metatarsal** should align with the medial border of the **cuboid**.
*   **Lateral View:** Look for dorsal displacement of the metatarsal bases relative to the cuneiforms ("Step-off").
*   **Fleck Sign:** A small bony avulsion fracture seen in the space between the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases. It represents the avulsion of the [[Lisfranc ligament]] and is diagnostic of serious injury.

**2. CT Scan**
*   Emerging as the gold standard for evaluating the extent of comminution and subtle displacements not seen on X-rays.

### Management

**Conservative Treatment**
*   **Indication:** Strictly for undisplaced, stable injuries (no diastasis on weight-bearing views).
*   **Method:** Below-knee [[plaster cast]] for 6–8 weeks.
*   **Protocol:** Non-weight bearing initially, followed by progressive weight bearing.

**Operative Treatment**
*   **Indication:** Displaced fractures (>2mm diastasis), unstable injuries, or loss of arch height.
*   **Methods:**
    *   **Closed Reduction and Percutaneous Pinning (CRPP):** Using [[K-wires]]. Used for less severe displacement (<50%).
    *   **Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF):** The gold standard for displaced injuries. Uses **cortical screws** (positional or lag screws) or plates to rigidly fix the medial and middle columns.
    *   **Primary Arthrodesis (Fusion):** Indicated for severe comminution (where anatomical restoration is impossible), purely ligamentous injuries with instability, or delayed presentation (>50% displacement).

### Complications
*   **Post-traumatic Osteoarthritis:** A common long-term complication leading to chronic midfoot pain. May require fusion later.
*   **Compartment Syndrome:** The foot has multiple compartments; severe swelling from Lisfranc injuries can lead to [[compartment syndrome]] of the foot requiring fasciotomy.
*   **Chronic Instability/Deformity:** Loss of the longitudinal arch (flat foot) and difficulty with push-off during walking.
*   **Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS):** Formerly Sudeck's atrophy.

### Clinical Implications
> **Don't Miss It:** Lisfranc injuries are notoriously missed in polytrauma patients or labeled as simple "foot sprains." Always look for the **Fleck Sign** and **Plantar Ecchymosis**. A missed Lisfranc injury leads to severe functional disability and chronic pain.
