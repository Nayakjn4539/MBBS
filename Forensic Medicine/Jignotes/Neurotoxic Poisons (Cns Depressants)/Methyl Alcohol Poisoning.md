# [[Neurotoxic Poisons (Cns Depressants)]] > Methyl Alcohol Poisoning

### [[Methyl Alcohol]] (Methanol) Poisoning

**Synonyms:** Wood alcohol, Wood spirit, Columbian spirit, Colonial spirit.

#### 1. Introduction and Properties
*   **Nature:** Colorless, volatile liquid with a faint, spirit-like odour and burning taste.
*   **Commercial Use:** Solvent, antifreeze, paint remover, varnish, denaturant for ethyl alcohol (methylated spirit contains 5-10% methanol).
*   **Source:** Distillation of wood. Often found in illicit liquor (moonshine/country liquor) leading to mass poisoning events known as **"Hooch Tragedies"**.

#### 2. Mode of Action (Toxicokinetics)
Methanol itself is mildly toxic (causing inebriation), but its **metabolites** are highly toxic.
*   **Absorption:** Rapidly absorbed via GIT, skin, and lungs.
*   **Metabolism:** Occurs in the [[Liver]] via the enzyme **[[Alcohol Dehydrogenase]] (ADH)**.
    1.  Methanol $\xrightarrow{ADH}$ **[[Formaldehyde]]** (33 times more toxic than methanol).
    2.  Formaldehyde $\xrightarrow{Aldehyde\ Dehydrogenase}$ **[[Formic Acid]]** (6 times more toxic than methanol).
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   **[[Metabolic Acidosis]]:** Caused by accumulation of Formic acid and lactic acid (due to inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase).
    *   **Ocular Toxicity:** Formic acid targets the optic nerve, causing optic neuritis and retinal edema.
    *   **CNS:** Depresses the CNS; necrosis of the **[[Putamen]]** in basal ganglia.

#### 3. Fatal Dose and Period
| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fatal Dose** | 60 to 200 ml (Biswas states 60-250 ml). Blindness can occur with as little as 10 ml. |
| **Fatal Period** | 24 to 36 hours. Can be delayed up to 3-4 days. |

#### 4. Clinical Features
Symptoms typically appear after a **latent period** of 12–24 hours (time required for metabolism to toxic metabolites).

**A. CNS Effects (Inebriation is less prominent than Ethanol)**
*   Headache, vertigo, dizziness, confusion.
*   **CNS Depression:** Drowsiness, stupor, coma.
*   **Convulsions** are a common terminal event.
*   **Putaminal Necrosis:** Leads to Parkinsonian symptoms in survivors.

**B. Ocular Symptoms (Hallmark of Toxicity)**
*   **[[Snowstorm Vision]]:** Blurred, misty vision or seeing white spots/snowfields.
*   **Photophobia** and dilated, fixed pupils (non-reactive to light).
*   **Fundoscopy:** Hyperemia of optic disc and retinal edema.
*   **Sequelae:** Optic atrophy and permanent irreversible **blindness**.

**C. Gastrointestinal**
*   Nausea, persistent vomiting.
*   Severe abdominal pain (often due to acute **[[Pancreatitis]]**).

**D. Metabolic**
*   **Severe Metabolic Acidosis:** High Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis (HAGMA).
*   **Kussmaul’s breathing:** Deep, labored breathing (air hunger) due to acidosis.

#### 5. Diagnosis
1.  **History:** Consumption of illicit liquor or solvents.
2.  **Smell:** Faint spirit-like odor in breath (less distinct than ethanol).
3.  **Lab Findings:**
    *   **High Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis**.
    *   **Increased Osmolal Gap**.
    *   Serum Methanol > 50 mg% (Serious poisoning).
    *   Elevated serum amylase (pancreatitis).

#### 6. Treatment
**A. Decontamination**
*   **[[Gastric Lavage]]:** Useful if early; use 5% Sodium Bicarbonate.
*   **Activated Charcoal:** Not very effective for alcohols but may be given for co-ingestants.

**B. Specific Antidotes**
1.  **[[Ethanol]] (Ethyl Alcohol):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Acts as a competitive substrate for Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ADH). ADH has 10–20x higher affinity for ethanol than methanol. This prevents the formation of toxic metabolites (Formaldehyde/Formic acid).
    *   **Dose:** Oral or IV. Maintain blood ethanol level at **100–130 mg/dL**.
    *   *Regimen:* 10% Ethanol IV or 50% Ethanol orally (mixed with juice).
2.  **[[Fomepizole]] (4-Methylpyrazole / 4-MP):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Potent inhibitor of Alcohol Dehydrogenase.
    *   **Advantage:** No CNS depression, easier dosing than ethanol.
    *   **Dose:** Loading dose 15 mg/kg IV.

**C. Adjunctive Therapy**
*   **[[Folinic Acid]] / Folic Acid:** Enhances the metabolism of Formic acid to CO2 and water (50 mg IV every 4 hours).
*   **Sodium Bicarbonate:** Aggressive correction of metabolic acidosis.

**D. Enhanced Elimination**
*   **[[Haemodialysis]]:** The **GOLD STANDARD** for severe poisoning.
    *   *Indications:* Visual impairment, Methanol > 50 mg/dL, severe resistant acidosis, renal failure.

**E. Supportive Care**
*   Protect eyes from light (to reduce retinal damage).
*   Treat seizures (Benzodiazepines).

#### 7. Autopsy Findings
**External:**
*   Cyanosis of face and nails.
*   Phenomenon of **postmortem lividity** (hypostasis) may be prominent.

**Internal:**
*   **Stomach:** Mucosa is congested, inflamed, and shows patch hemorrhages (**Red Velvety** appearance).
*   **Lungs:** Congested and edematous.
*   **Brain:** Cerebral edema, **[[Putaminal Necrosis]]** (bilateral symmetrical necrosis of Putamen is characteristic).
*   **Eyes:** Retinal edema and optic nerve atrophy.
*   **Liver & Kidneys:** Fatty degeneration and tubular necrosis.

**Preservation of Viscera:** Use **Saturated Sodium Chloride** solution (Salt water). *Do not use Rectified Spirit* as preservative because it contains ethanol, which interferes with chemical analysis.

#### 8. Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Accidental:** Most common. Mistaken for ethanol or consumption of adulterated/illicit liquor (**Hooch**). Can cause mass casualties.
*   **Occupational:** Inhalation of vapors in industries (varnish, polish).
*   **Suicidal/Homicidal:** Rare due to unpleasant taste compared to ethanol.
