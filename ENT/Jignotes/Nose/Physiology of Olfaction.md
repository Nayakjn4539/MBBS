# [[Nose]] > Physiology of Olfaction

### Anatomy of the Olfactory System

**Olfaction** is the special visceral afferent sensation responsible for the perception of smell. In humans, it acts as a chemical alert system and contributes significantly to the perception of flavor.

#### 1. The Olfactory Region
The [[olfactory epithelium]] is a specialized neuroepithelium located in the high nasal vault.
*   **Location:** Lining the upper one-third of the nasal cavity. This includes the roof of the nasal cavity, the upper part of the [[nasal septum]], the [[cribriform plate]], and the [[superior turbinate]] (and potentially the upper part of the middle turbinate).
*   **Surface Area:** Approximately 2.5 $cm^2$ to 5 $cm^2$ in each nasal cavity.
*   **Color:** In living subjects, it appears pale or yellowish-brown compared to the pink respiratory mucosa.

#### 2. Histology of Olfactory Mucosa
The olfactory mucosa consists of the olfactory epithelium and the lamina propria. The epithelium is pseudostratified and lacks goblet cells. It contains three primary cell types:

| Cell Type | Characteristics | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Olfactory Receptor Cells** | First-order **bipolar neurons**. They have a peripheral dendrite ending in an **olfactory knob/vesicle** and a central axon. | The primary transducers of smell. Uniquely, these neurons can regenerate throughout life (turnover cycle: 30–40 days). |
| **Supporting (Sustentacular) Cells** | Columnar cells with microvilli. They contain yellow pigment (lipofuscin). | Provide structural and metabolic support to receptor cells, similar to glial cells. |
| **Basal Cells** | Stem cells located on the basement membrane. | Pluripotent cells capable of dividing and differentiating into new receptor neurons or supporting cells. |

**Glands of Bowman:**
*   Located in the lamina propria.
*   **Function:** Secrete a thin, watery fluid (mucus) that bathes the olfactory surface. This fluid contains **odorant-binding proteins** (OBP) and secretory IgA.
*   **Role:** Solubilizes odorant molecules to allow interaction with receptors and washes away old odorants to keep receptors fresh.

### Physiology of Olfaction (Transduction)

For a substance to be smelled, it must meet specific physical criteria:
1.  **Volatile:** Must be airborne to be inhaled.
2.  **Water-soluble:** To dissolve in the mucus layer covering the epithelium.
3.  **Lipid-soluble:** To penetrate the lipid bilayer of the receptor cell membrane.

**Mnemonic: VWL** (Volatile, Water-soluble, Lipid-soluble).

#### Mechanism of Transduction
The conversion of chemical energy into an electrical signal occurs at the **olfactory cilia**.

1.  **Airflow:** During quiet respiration, air flows primarily through the middle meatus (laminar flow). Only **10–15%** of inspired air reaches the olfactory cleft via eddy currents. **Sniffing** creates turbulence, driving more air to the olfactory region.
2.  **Binding:** Odorant molecules dissolve in the mucus and bind to specific receptor sites on the cilia of the olfactory receptor neuron.
3.  **Activation:** This binding activates **G-protein coupled receptors** (Golf).
4.  **Cascade:** Activation of **Adenyl Cyclase** $\rightarrow$ Increase in intracellular **cAMP**.
5.  **Depolarization:** cAMP opens cation channels, causing an influx of **$Na^+$** and **$Ca^{2+}$** and an efflux of $Cl^-$.
6.  **Action Potential:** This ion shift causes depolarization (generator potential). If threshold is reached, an action potential is triggered in the axon.

### The Olfactory Pathway

The olfactory pathway is unique as it projects directly to the cortex without relaying first in the thalamus (unlike other sensory systems).

1.  **First-Order Neurons (Olfactory Nerves):**
    *   Formed by the unmyelinated axons of the olfactory receptor cells.
    *   Gather into 12–20 bundles (fila olfactoria).
    *   Pass through the foramina of the **[[cribriform plate]]** of the ethmoid bone.
    *   *Clinical Implication:* These nerves carry meningeal sheaths; injury here provides a route for infection (meningitis) or **[[CSF rhinorrhea]]**.

2.  **Second-Order Neurons (Olfactory Bulb):**
    *   The nerves synapse with **Mitral cells** and **Tufted cells** in the **[[Olfactory bulb]]**.
    *   These synapses form spherical structures called **Glomeruli**.
    *   The bulb lies on the cribriform plate in the anterior cranial fossa.

3.  **Olfactory Tract:**
    *   Axons of Mitral and Tufted cells form the **[[Olfactory tract]]**.
    *   The tract runs posteriorly and divides into medial and lateral olfactory striae.

4.  **Cortical Centers (Interpretation):**
    *   **Primary Olfactory Cortex:** The tract terminates in the **prepyriform cortex** and **periamygdaloid area** (uncus) of the temporal lobe. Here, conscious awareness of smell occurs.
    *   **Secondary Olfactory Cortex:** Entorhinal area.
    *   **Limbic System Connections:** Projections to the **[[Amygdala]]**, **[[Hippocampus]]**, and **Hypothalamus**.
        *   *Function:* Mediates emotional responses (fear, pleasure) and memory associated with smells (e.g., perfume reminding one of a person).

### Accessory Systems

1.  **Trigeminal System (CN V):**
    *   Free nerve endings of the [[trigeminal nerve]] (ophthalmic and maxillary divisions) are present in the nasal mucosa.
    *   **Function:** Detects noxious, pungent, or irritant stimuli (e.g., ammonia, menthol, chlorine).
    *   *Clinical Note:* A patient with total anosmia may still respond to ammonia due to trigeminal stimulation. Therefore, ammonia is **not** used to test the olfactory nerve.

2.  **Vomeronasal Organ (Jacobson's Organ):**
    *   Located in the anteroinferior nasal septum (vestigial in humans).
    *   In animals, it detects pheromones (sexual behavior). Its function in humans is debated/uncertain.

3.  **Retronasal Olfaction:**
    *   Aroma from food enters the nasopharynx from the mouth during swallowing/exhalation.
    *   This contributes significantly to the perception of **flavor**. Loss of smell often presents as a complaint of "loss of taste".

### Clinical Implications

#### Classification of Olfactory Disorders (Dysosmia)

| Condition | Definition | Common Causes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Anosmia]]** | Total loss of smell | Head trauma (shearing of nerves), Viral URI, Obstruction (Polyps), [[Kallmann syndrome]] (congenital). |
| **[[Hyposmia]]** | Decreased sense of smell | Allergic rhinitis, Chronic sinusitis, Age (Presbyosmia), Smoking. |
| **[[Parosmia]]** (Troposmia) | Distorted smell perception (usually unpleasant) | Recovery phase of viral infection (aberrant regeneration). |
| **[[Phantosmia]]** | Hallucination of smell (non-existent odor) | Temporal lobe epilepsy (uncinate fits), Schizophrenia, Head injury. |
| **Cacosmia** | Perception of foul/rotten smell | Chronic sinusitis (anaerobic infection), Foreign body. |

#### Specific Clinical Entities
*   **Kallmann Syndrome:** Congenital anosmia + Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (failure of GnRH neurons to migrate).
*   **Merciful Anosmia:** Seen in **[[Atrophic Rhinitis]]**. The patient emits a foul smell but is unaware of it due to atrophy of nerve endings.
*   **Foster Kennedy Syndrome:** Frontal lobe tumor causing ipsilateral anosmia, ipsilateral optic atrophy, and contralateral papilledema.
*   **Neurodegenerative Diseases:** Hyposmia is an early sign of **[[Parkinson's disease]]** and **[[Alzheimer's disease]]**.

### Assessment of Olfaction

1.  **Subjective Tests (Psychophysical):**
    *   **Simple Office Test:** Use common odors (soap, coffee, lemon). Avoid irritants like ammonia. Test each nostril separately.
    *   **UPSIT (University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test):** "Scratch and sniff" booklets; standard quantitative test.
    *   **Sniffin' Sticks:** Pen-like devices to test threshold, discrimination, and identification.

2.  **Objective Tests:**
    *   **Electro-olfactogram (EOG):** Measures electrical potential changes in the olfactory epithelium (research tool).
    *   **Evoked Potential Olfactometry:** Measures EEG changes in response to smell.
