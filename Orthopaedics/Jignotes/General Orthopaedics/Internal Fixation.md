# [[General Orthopaedics]] > Internal Fixation

### Internal Fixation

**Internal fixation** (Osteosynthesis) involves the surgical stabilization of [[fracture fragments]] using metallic or non-metallic devices implanted within the body. It provides stability, maintains anatomical position, and facilitates early mobilization, thereby preventing "fracture disease" (stiffness and oedema),,.

#### **Indications for Internal Fixation**
Internal fixation is indicated when conservative methods fail or are inappropriate.
*   **Irreducible fractures:** Fractures that cannot be reduced by closed manipulation (e.g., soft tissue interposition),.
*   **Unstable fractures:** Fractures prone to re-displacement after reduction (e.g., [[midshaft forearm fractures]], ankle fractures),.
*   **Poorly uniting fractures:** Fractures with a high risk of [[non-union]] or delayed union (e.g., [[fracture neck of femur]]),.
*   **Pathological fractures:** Bone weakened by disease/tumor requires stabilization.
*   **Polytrauma:** Early fixation facilitates nursing care and reduces general complications (e.g., [[ARDS]], [[fat embolism]]),.
*   **Intra-articular fractures:** Requiring perfect anatomical reduction to prevent [[secondary osteoarthritis]],.
*   **Vascular injury:** Fixation is needed to protect vascular repairs,.

### **Methods and Implants**

Internal fixation is achieved using screws, plates, intramedullary nails, and wires,.

#### **1. Screws**
Screws convert rotational force into linear motion to fix bone fragments.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Cortical Screws:** Have fine threads (smaller pitch) along the whole shaft. Used for diaphyseal bone,,.
    *   **Cancellous Screws:** Have coarser, deeper threads (larger pitch) to grip spongy bone. Often partially threaded to produce a **lag effect**,.
    *   **Cannulated Screws:** Hollow screws inserted over a [[guide wire]]. Commonly used for [[fracture neck of femur]] fixation,.
    *   **Malleolar Screws:** Sharp-pointed tip, used for [[medial malleolus]].
    *   **Herbert Screws:** Headless differential pitch screws used for [[scaphoid fractures]].
*   **Function:**
    *   **Lag Screw Principle:** Used to produce **interfragmentary compression**. The screw glides through the near cortex and threads into the far cortex, pulling fragments together,.

#### **2. Plates**
Plates are surface implants fixed with screws. They can function in different modes based on design and application.
*   **Neutralization Plate:** Bridges a fracture to protect lag screws from bending/torsional forces.
*   **Compression Plate (DCP):** **Dynamic Compression Plate**. Screw holes are designed with a slope (spherical gliding principle). As the screw is tightened eccentric to the hole, the plate moves relative to the bone, compressing the fracture ends,,.
*   **Buttress Plate:** Used to support/buttress articular fragments to prevent collapse (e.g., [[tibial condyle fractures]]),.
*   **Bridging Plate:** Spans a comminuted area without disturbing the fragments, preserving biology,.
*   **Locking Compression Plate (LCP):** Screws lock into the plate, creating a fixed-angle construct. It acts as an **"internal fixator"** and does not require friction against the bone, preserving periosteal blood supply,.

#### **3. Intramedullary Nails (IM Nails)**
Metal rods inserted into the [[medial medullary canal]] of long bones. They act as **internal splints** and are **load-sharing devices** (unlike plates which are load-bearing),.
*   **Kuntscher Nail (K-Nail):** Cloverleaf cross-section. Provides 3-point fixation. Does not provide rotational stability. Used mainly for femoral shaft isthmus fractures,,.
*   **Interlocking Nail:** Standard IM nail modified with holes at proximal and distal ends for locking bolts. Prevents **rotation** and **telescoping** (shortening). It is the gold standard for femoral and tibial diaphyseal fractures,,,.
*   **Flexible Nails (TENS/Enders):** Used in pediatric fractures. They rely on 3-point fixation and stacking,.

#### **4. Wires (Kirschner Wires / K-wires)**
*   Used for temporary fixation, small bones (hand/foot), or in children,.
*   **Tension Band Wiring (TBW):** Converts distracting tensile forces into compressive forces. Used for [[patella fractures]] and [[olecranon fractures]],,.

### **External Fixators**

Fixation of bone fragments using pins (Schanz screws) inserted into the bone but connected to a rigid frame/rod *outside* the body,,.

#### **Indications**
*   **Open Fractures (Type II/III):** Where internal fixation carries high infection risk,.
*   **Infected Fractures/Non-union:** To allow wound care.
*   **Pelvic Fractures:** For rapid stabilization ("damage control"),.
*   **Limb Lengthening/Deformity Correction:** Using the Ilizarov technique,.

#### **Types**
1.  **Monolateral Fixators:** Pins connected to a bar on one side of the limb (Uniplanar).
2.  **Circular Fixators (Ilizarov):** Uses tensioned thin wires and rings. Highly stable. Allows [[distraction osteogenesis]] (Callotasis),,.
3.  **Hybrid Fixators:** Combination of wires/rings and pins/rods.

#### **Clinical Implications: Ilizarov Technique**
Based on the principle of **Distraction Histogenesis**. Gradual distraction of the corticotomy site (1 mm/day) stimulates new bone formation (regenerate),.

### **Comparison: Internal vs. External Fixation**

| Feature | Internal Fixation | External Fixation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stability** | Rigid/Stable (Early mobilization) | Variable (depending on construct) |
| **Soft Tissue** | Requires stripping (unless MIPO) | Minimal stripping |
| **Infection Risk** | Higher in open fractures | Pin tract infection common |
| **Patient Comfort** | Comfortable (implant inside) | Cumbersome (frame outside) |
| **Primary Use** | Closed fractures, Articular # | Open #, Infected #, Deformity |,,,

### **Complications of Fixation**
1.  **Infection:** Biofilm formation on implants.
2.  **Implant Failure:** Screw pull-out, plate bending, nail breakage due to metal fatigue if union is delayed.
3.  **Stress Shielding:** Rigid plates may cause bone porosity under the implant.
4.  **Refracture:** Can occur after implant removal.
5.  **Pin Tract Infection:** Specific to external fixators.
