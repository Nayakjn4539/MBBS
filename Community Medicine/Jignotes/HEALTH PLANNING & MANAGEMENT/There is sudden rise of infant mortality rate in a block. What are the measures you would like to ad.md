# [[HEALTH PLANNING & MANAGEMENT]] > There is sudden rise of infant mortality rate in a block. What are the measures you would like to adopt to reduce the IMR in block?

### Approach to Sudden Rise in Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)

A sudden rise in [[Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)]] in a block suggests an acute breakdown in health services, an outbreak of disease, or a specific environmental disaster. As the Block Medical Officer (BMO), the approach involves an immediate investigation followed by specific intervention measures.

#### 1. Immediate Investigation (Situation Analysis)
Before implementing measures, the cause of the sudden spike must be identified.
*   **Verification of Data:** Confirm if the rise is real or a reporting error. Check registers (ANM, ASHA, Burial grounds).
*   **Verbal Autopsy:** Conduct verbal autopsies for recent infant deaths to determine the specific cause (e.g., clustered neonatal tetanus, measles outbreak, acute diarrheal outbreak).
*   **Epidemiological Analysis:**
    *   **Time:** Is there a seasonal trend (e.g., malaria/diarrhea season)?
    *   **Place:** Is the rise clustered in a specific village or widely distributed?
    *   **Person:** Are the deaths neonatal (0-28 days) or post-neonatal (1-12 months)?
*   **Service Availability Check:** Check for stock-outs (vaccines, ORS), cold chain failure, or absence of key staff (ANM/Doctors).

#### 2. Specific Measures to Reduce IMR
Measures are categorized based on the phase of infancy and the level of prevention.

**A. Antenatal Care (Prenatal Measures)**
*Target: To prevent Low Birth Weight (LBW) and congenital issues.*
*   **Early Registration:** Ensure 100% registration of pregnancies within the first trimester (12 weeks).
*   **Nutrition:** Supplementation with **Iron and Folic Acid (IFA)** and Calcium. Treat maternal anemia aggressively as it correlates directly with [[Low Birth Weight (LBW)]].
*   **High-Risk Screening:** Identification and line-listing of high-risk pregnancies (e.g., pre-eclampsia, severe anemia, malpresentations) and referral to **First Referral Units (FRUs)**.
*   **Tetanus Prevention:** Ensure 2 doses of [[Tetanus Toxoid]] to prevent Neonatal Tetanus.

**B. Intranatal Care (During Delivery)**
*Target: To prevent Birth Asphyxia and Sepsis.*
*   **Institutional Delivery:** Promote deliveries in health facilities using incentives like [[Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY)]].
*   **Skill Birth Attendance:** Ensure deliveries are conducted by Skilled Birth Attendants (SBA).
*   **The 5 Cleans:** For home deliveries, strictly enforce the 5 Cleans:
    1.  Clean hands
    2.  Clean surface
    3.  Clean blade
    4.  Clean cord tie
    5.  Clean cord stump (No application of cow dung/oil)
*   **Resuscitation:** Implementation of [[Navjat Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (NSSK)]] protocols to manage birth asphyxia immediately.

**C. Neonatal Care (First 28 Days)**
*Target: To manage LBW, Hypothermia, and Infection.*
*   **Home Based Newborn Care (HBNC):** [[ASHA]] workers must visit homes on days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42 to screen for danger signs.
*   **Thermal Control:**
    *   **Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC):** For LBW babies (<2.5 kg) to prevent hypothermia.
    *   **Warm Chain:** Delayed bathing (after 7 days), proper wrapping.
*   **Facility Based Care:** Strengthening [[Newborn Stabilization Units (NBSU)]] and [[Special Newborn Care Units (SNCU)]] for sick neonates.
*   **Zero Expense Treatment:** Utilize [[Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK)]] to provide free drugs, diagnostics, and transport for sick newborns.

**D. Post-Neonatal Care (1 month to 1 year)**
*Target: To prevent Diarrhea, Pneumonia, and Malnutrition.*
*   **Breastfeeding:**
    *   Initiation within **1 hour** of birth.
    *   **Exclusive Breastfeeding** for 6 months (No water/honey/ghutti).
*   **Infection Control:**
    *   **Diarrhea:** Promotion of [[Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS)]] and Zinc supplementation.
    *   **ARI:** Early diagnosis and treatment of Pneumonia using Cotrimoxazole/Amoxicillin.
    *   **Immunization:** 100% coverage under **Universal Immunization Programme (UIP)** (Measles, Pentavalent, PCV, Rotavirus).
*   **Growth Monitoring:** Monthly weighing at Anganwadis to detect growth faltering early.

**E. Social and Environmental Measures**
*   **Sanitation:** Improvement of water sources and disposal of excreta to break the fecal-oral transmission chain.
*   **Family Planning:** Promote birth spacing (at least 2 years). Studies show IMR is higher in closely spaced births.
*   **Education:** Focus on female literacy, as maternal education is a key determinant of child survival.

### Mnemonics for IMR Reduction

**"G-B-I-F-S"** (Factors to control)
*   **G:** **G**rowth Monitoring
*   **B:** **B**reastfeeding promotion
*   **I:** **I**mmunization & Infection control
*   **F:** **F**amily Planning
*   **S:** **S**anitation & Socio-economic development

**"3 C's"** (For Neonatal Survival)
*   **C**lean delivery (Asepsis)
*   **C**lear airway (Resuscitation)
*   **C**over the baby (Thermal control)

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Sudden Rise:** If the rise is due to neonatal tetanus or measles, immediate "Mop-up" immunization rounds are required.
*   **LBW Management:** LBW and prematurity constitute the single largest cause of infant deaths in India (approx. 57%). Therefore, **Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC)** is the most high-yield intervention.
