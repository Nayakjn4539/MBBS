# [[Nerve Injuries]] > Sciatic Nerve Injury

### Anatomy and Functional Overview

The [[Sciatic Nerve]] is the thickest and largest nerve in the human body. It is the continuation of the upper band of the sacral plexus.

*   **Root Value:** L4, L5, S1, S2, S3.
*   **Course:**
    *   It leaves the pelvis through the **greater sciatic notch**, passing inferior to the [[Piriformis Muscle]].
    *   It descends between the greater trochanter of the [[Femur]] and the ischial tuberosity.
    *   It runs down the posterior aspect of the thigh.
    *   **Division:** Typically, in the lower third of the thigh (though variations occur), it divides into two terminal branches:
        1.  **[[Tibial Nerve]]** (Medial Popliteal).
        2.  **[[Common Peroneal Nerve]]** (Lateral Popliteal).
*   **Motor Supply (Thigh):** Before dividing, the main trunk supplies the **Hamstring muscles**:
    *   [[Biceps Femoris]]
    *   [[Semitendinosus]]
    *   [[Semimembranosus]]
    *   Ischial head of [[Adductor Magnus]]
*   **Sensory Supply:** Via its terminal branches, it supplies sensation to nearly the entire leg and foot, *except* for the medial aspect of the leg and foot (supplied by the [[Saphenous Nerve]], a branch of the Femoral Nerve).

### Etiology and Mechanisms of Injury

Injuries to the sciatic nerve can be catastrophic due to the extensive muscle groups involved. The injury may be a [[Neuropraxia]], [[Axonotmesis]], or [[Neurotmesis]].

#### 1. Traumatic Causes
*   **[[Posterior Hip Dislocation]]:** This is a classic cause (e.g., dashboard injury). The nerve lies immediately behind the posterior wall of the [[Acetabulum]]. Displacement of the femoral head or bone fragments can stretch or compress the nerve.
*   **[[Fracture Acetabulum]]:** Specifically fractures involving the posterior column or wall.
*   **Penetrating Injuries:** Gunshot wounds or deep stab wounds in the gluteal region or thigh.
*   **Femoral Shaft Fractures:** Although less common, severe displacement can injure the nerve.

#### 2. Iatrogenic Causes (Doctor-Induced)
*   **Intramuscular Injections:** Poorly placed gluteal injections (usually in the lower inner quadrant instead of the upper outer quadrant) can directly damage the nerve ("Injection Palsy").
*   **[[Total Hip Arthroplasty]] (THA):** Retraction injury, thermal injury from cement, or lengthening of the limb causing traction.
*   **Surgery:** Complications during pelvic or femoral surgeries.

#### 3. Compression Neuropathies
*   **[[Piriformis Syndrome]]:** Entrapment of the nerve as it passes beneath or through the piriformis muscle.
*   **"Wallet Neuritis":** Compression in the gluteal region from sitting on a thick wallet for prolonged periods.

### Clinical Features

The clinical presentation depends on the level of the lesion.

#### 1. High Lesion (Gluteal Region/Upper Thigh)
This creates a **Flail Lower Limb**.
*   **Motor Loss:**
    *   Paralysis of **Hamstrings**: Weakness of knee flexion.
    *   Paralysis of **all muscles below the knee**: Loss of dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, inversion, and eversion.
    *   The patient cannot stand on the toes or heels.
*   **Deformity:**
    *   **[[Foot Drop]]**: Due to gravity and loss of dorsiflexion.
    *   **Flail Foot**: Complete loss of stability and motor control in the foot.
*   **Reflexes:**
    *   **[[Ankle Jerk]] (Achilles reflex):** Absent.
    *   **Knee Jerk:** Generally preserved (supplied by Femoral Nerve), unless the injury is extremely proximal or involves the lumbar plexus.
*   **Sensory Loss:**
    *   Loss of sensation over the entire foot and leg.
    *   **Sparing:** Sensation is preserved over the **medial aspect of the leg and foot** (Saphenous nerve territory) and the anterior thigh (Femoral nerve territory).

#### 2. Low Lesion (Above Knee/Popliteal Fossa)
*   **Motor Loss:** Hamstrings are usually spared (innervated higher up). Muscles below the knee are paralyzed.
*   **Sensory Loss:** Similar to high lesions but thigh sensation is intact.

**Clinical Distinction of Component Injury:**
In partial lesions (e.g., hip dislocation), the **peroneal division** is more frequently affected than the tibial division because:
1.  Its fibers are more superficial and lateral.
2.  It has less connective tissue support.
3.  It is tethered at the sciatic notch and fibular neck (less mobile).

### Clinical Signs and Examination

*   **Look:**
    *   **Foot Drop:** The foot hangs in equinus.
    *   **Muscle Wasting:** Gluteal region, hamstrings, and calf muscles (in chronic cases).
    *   **Trophic Ulcers:** Check the sole of the foot and heel. Loss of sensation makes these areas prone to pressure sores.
    *   **Dry Skin:** Due to loss of autonomic supply (anhidrosis).
*   **Feel:**
    *   Sensory mapping to identify the area of anesthesia (remember medial sparing).
*   **Move:**
    *   Ask the patient to flex the knee (tests hamstrings).
    *   Ask the patient to dorsiflex and plantarflex the ankle (tests leg muscles).

**Clinical Implication:** In posterior hip dislocation, always document sciatic nerve function *before* and *after* reduction. If nerve function deteriorates after closed reduction, it indicates entrapment, requiring immediate surgical exploration.

### Investigations

*   **X-rays:** To rule out fractures of the pelvis, acetabulum, or femur; or to identify dislocations.
*   **[[MRI]]:**
    *   Best for visualizing soft tissue.
    *   Can detect nerve continuity, compression by hematoma, or entrapment in the hip joint.
*   **Electrodiagnostic Studies ([[EMG]]/[[NCV]]):**
    *   Helpful in localizing the lesion and determining the severity (Neuropraxia vs. Neurotmesis).
    *   Usually performed 3-4 weeks post-injury for accurate prognostication (detecting denervation potentials).

### Management

#### 1. Conservative Management
Most closed injuries (e.g., from traction or blunt trauma) are treated conservatively initially, as they are often neuropraxia or axonotmesis.
*   **Splinting:** A **[[Foot Drop Splint]]** (Ankle-Foot Orthosis - AFO) is mandatory to prevent equinus contracture.
*   **Physiotherapy:** Passive range of motion (ROM) exercises to keep ankle and toe joints supple. Electrical stimulation to maintain muscle bulk.
*   **Skin Care:** meticulous care to prevent trophic ulcers on the insensitive sole.
*   **Observation:** Monitor for signs of recovery (Tinel’s sign advancement).

#### 2. Surgical Management
*   **Indications for Early Exploration:**
    *   Open/Penetrating injuries (stab, gunshot).
    *   Iatrogenic injury (e.g., screw placement during hip surgery).
    *   Deterioration of neurological status after manipulation of a hip dislocation/fracture.
    *   Associated vascular injury.
*   **Delayed Exploration:** If no signs of recovery are seen clinically or on EMG after 3-6 months.
*   **Procedures:**
    *   **Neurolysis:** Releasing the nerve from scar tissue.
    *   **Nerve Repair/Grafting:** Direct suture or using sural nerve grafts. *Note: Results of sciatic nerve repair are generally poor due to the large distance the regenerating axons must travel.*

#### 3. Salvage Procedures
If recovery does not occur (irreparable damage):
*   **Tendon Transfers:** Usually not effective for a complete sciatic lesion because no motors are available below the knee.
*   **Arthrodesis:** Triple arthrodesis or ankle fusion to stabilize the flail foot.
*   **Amputation:** In severe cases with intractable trophic ulcers or painful paresthesia, below-knee amputation may be considered for functional rehabilitation with a prosthesis.

---

### Prognosis

*   **Overall:** Poor compared to radial or ulnar nerve injuries.
*   **Factors:**
    *   The nerve innervates large anti-gravity muscles.
    *   The distance from the buttock to the foot is long; by the time axons regenerate to the distal muscles, the motor end-plates may have degenerated (irreversible atrophy).
    *   **Tibial Component:** Better prognosis than the peroneal component.
    *   **Peroneal Component:** Poor prognosis; recovery of dorsiflexion is often incomplete.
