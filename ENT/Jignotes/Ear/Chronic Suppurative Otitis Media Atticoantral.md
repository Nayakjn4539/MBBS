# Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media: Atticoantral Type

### Synonyms
*   **Squamosal type**
*   **Unsafe type**
*   **Dangerous type**

### Definition
**Atticoantral CSOM** involves the posterosuperior part of the middle ear cleft (attic, antrum, and mastoid). It is associated with bone-eroding pathology, most commonly [[cholesteatoma]], granulations, or osteitis. It is termed "unsafe" or "dangerous" because of the high risk of developing life-threatening intratemporal and intracranial complications.

---

### Etiopathogenesis: Cholesteatoma
The hallmark of atticoantral disease is [[cholesteatoma]].
*   **Definition:** It is a sac lined by **keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium** found in the middle ear cleft (skin in the wrong place). It contains desquamated keratin debris.
*   **Note:** It is a misnomer; it contains neither cholesterol crystals nor is it a neoplastic tumor (oma).

#### Classification of Cholesteatoma

**1. Congenital Cholesteatoma**
*   Arises from embryonic epithelial cell rests.
*   **Levenson’s Criteria:**
    *   White mass behind an *intact* [[tympanic membrane]].
    *   Normal pars flaccida and pars tensa.
    *   No history of otorrhea or prior otologic surgery.
    *   Prior otitis media is *not* an exclusion criterion.

**2. Primary Acquired Cholesteatoma**
*   Occurs in the absence of a pre-existing perforation.
*   **Theories of Genesis:**
    *   **Invagination Theory (Wittmaack’s):** Most accepted. Negative middle ear pressure (Eustachian tube dysfunction) causes a [[retraction pocket]] in the pars flaccida or posterosuperior pars tensa. This pocket accumulates keratin and expands.
    *   **Basal Cell Hyperplasia (Ruedi’s):** Proliferation of basal cells of pars flaccida induced by infection.
    *   **Squamous Metaplasia (Sade’s):** Metaplasia of middle ear mucosa into squamous epithelium due to chronic infection.

**3. Secondary Acquired Cholesteatoma**
*   Associated with a pre-existing perforation.
*   **Theories:**
    *   **Migration Theory (Habermann’s):** Squamous epithelium from the [[external auditory canal]] (EAC) migrates into the middle ear through a marginal perforation.
    *   **Metaplasia:** Middle ear mucosa transforms due to infection.

### Pathology of Bone Destruction
[[Cholesteatoma]] has the property of eroding bone, facilitating spread to the mastoid, labyrinth, and cranium.
*   **Mechanism:** It is **enzymatic**, not just pressure necrosis.
*   **Enzymes involved:** Collagenase, acid phosphatase, and proteolytic enzymes released by osteoclasts and mononuclear inflammatory cells.
*   **Structures eroded:**
    *   **Ossicles:** [[Incus]] (long process) is the most commonly eroded ossicle, followed by the stapes superstructure.
    *   **Bony Canal:** Scutum (outer attic wall).
    *   **Facial Nerve Canal:** Leading to [[facial nerve palsy]].
    *   **Labyrinth:** Lateral semicircular canal (leading to fistula).
    *   **Tegmen Tympani/Sinus Plate:** Leading to intracranial spread.

**Clinical Implication:** **"Cholesteatoma Hearer"** – Occasionally, the cholesteatoma mass bridges the gap between the eroded ossicles (e.g., between the malleus and stapes), transmitting sound. In these patients, hearing may worsen post-surgery when the mass is removed.

### Clinical Features

#### Symptoms
1.  **Ear Discharge (Otorrhea):**
    *   **Scanty:** Often not profuse.
    *   **Foul-smelling:** Due to bone destruction and anaerobic infection (saprophytic).
    *   **Purulent:** Thick consistency.
    *   **Blood-stained:** Suggests granulation tissue or polyps.
2.  **Hearing Loss:**
    *   Usually conductive or mixed.
    *   Severity varies (may be severe if ossicular chain is disrupted).
3.  **Bleeding:** From friable granulations/polyp.

**Warning Symptoms (Suggest Complications):**
*   **Pain:** Otogenic pain in CSOM indicates pus under tension or extradural abscess.
*   **Vertigo:** Suggests erosion of the lateral [[semicircular canal]] (fistula).
*   **Headache:** Suggests intracranial extension.
*   **Facial weakness:** Erosion of the Fallopian canal.

#### Signs (Otoscopy/Microscopy)
*   **Perforation:**
    *   **Attic perforation:** In pars flaccida.
    *   **Posterosuperior marginal perforation:** In pars tensa (annulus is eroded).
*   **Retraction Pocket:** Accumulation of keratin debris.
*   **Cholesteatoma:** Visible as "pearly white flakes" or debris.
*   **Polyp:** Fleshy, red polyp (sentinel polyp) often seen in the attic region. **Never avulse a polyp** blindly as it may be attached to the stapes, facial nerve, or horizontal canal.
*   **Granulation tissue:** Often bleeds on touch.

### Differences: Tubotympanic vs. Atticoantral CSOM

| Feature | Tubotympanic (Safe/Mucosal) | Atticoantral (Unsafe/Squamous) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pathology** | Mucosal inflammation | [[Cholesteatoma]] / Bone erosion |
| **Discharge** | Profuse, Mucoid, Odorless | Scanty, Purulent, Foul-smelling |
| **Perforation** | Central (Pars Tensa) | Attic or Marginal (Pars Tensa) |
| **Polyp** | Pale, mucosal | Red, fleshy, granulation |
| **Ossicles** | Usually intact (or minor necrosis) | Often destroyed (Incus MC) |
| **Complications** | Rare | Common (Intracranial/Intratemporal) |
| **Treatment** | Antibiotics / [[Myringoplasty]] | Surgery ([[Mastoidectomy]]) |

### Bacteriology
Usually a mixed infection.
*   **Aerobes:** *[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]* (Most Common), *Proteus*, *E. coli*, *Staphylococcus aureus*.
*   **Anaerobes:** *Bacteroides fragilis*, Anaerobic streptococci.

---

### Investigations
1.  **Examination under Microscope (EUM):** Gold standard for clinical assessment. To visualize extent of retraction, debris, and granulations.
2.  **Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA):** Assessment of degree and type of hearing loss (Conductive vs Mixed).
3.  **Imaging (HRCT Temporal Bone):**
    *   **Indications:** Suspected complications, revision surgery.
    *   **Findings:** Erosion of **scutum** (early sign), ossicular erosion, widening of aditus, erosion of tegmen or sinus plate, fistula of lateral semicircular canal.
4.  **Culture and Sensitivity:** Of ear discharge.

---

### Complications
Due to bone erosion, infection spreads beyond the middle ear.

**Intratemporal**
*   [[Mastoiditis]] (coalescent).
*   [[Petrositis]] (Gradenigo’s triad).
*   [[Facial nerve paralysis]].
*   [[Labyrinthitis]] (Circumscribed/Fistula or Diffuse).

**Intracranial**
*   [[Meningitis]] (Most common intracranial complication).
*   [[Brain abscess]] (Temporal lobe > Cerebellar).
*   [[Sigmoid sinus thrombosis]] (Lateral sinus thrombosis).
*   Extradural / Subdural abscess.
*   Otitic Hydrocephalus.

### Treatment
The primary aim is to make the ear **safe and dry**. Hearing preservation is secondary. Medical management (aural toilet, antibiotic drops) is only a temporary measure to reduce infection before surgery.

**Surgical Management:**

#### 1. Canal Wall Up (CWU) Procedures
*   **Examples:** Combined Approach Tympanoplasty (CAT), Intact Canal Wall Mastoidectomy.
*   **Concept:** Removal of disease via mastoid and posterior tympanotomy while keeping the posterior meatal wall intact.
*   **Pros:** Normal anatomy preserved, easier hearing aid fitting, no cavity problems.
*   **Cons:** Higher risk of **residual/recurrent cholesteatoma**, "second-look" surgery often needed.

#### 2. Canal Wall Down (CWD) Procedures
*   **Concept:** The posterior meatal wall is removed, converting the mastoid and middle ear into a common cavity (exteriorization).
*   **Modified Radical Mastoidectomy (MRM):**
    *   **Indication:** Most common surgery for atticoantral disease.
    *   **Procedure:** Removal of disease (cholesteatoma/matrix), removal of posterior canal wall, **preservation** of healthy remnants of tympanic membrane and ossicles for hearing reconstruction.
*   **Radical Mastoidectomy:**
    *   **Indication:** Extensive disease with unresectable extension (e.g., to Eustachian tube), or when hearing is not salvageable.
    *   **Procedure:** Removal of all mastoid cells, ossicles (except stapes footplate), tympanic membrane, and mucosa. Eustachian tube is obliterated.
*   **Atticotomy:** Limited removal of lateral attic wall for localized attic cholesteatoma.

**Post-Operative Care:**
*   Meatoplasty (widening the meatus) is crucial in CWD procedures to allow aeration and cleaning.
*   Regular cavity cleaning (lifelong) may be required for CWD cavities.
