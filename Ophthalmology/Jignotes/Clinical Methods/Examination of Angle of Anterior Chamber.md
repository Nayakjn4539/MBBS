# [[Clinical Methods]] > Examination of Angle of Anterior Chamber

# Examination of Angle of Anterior Chamber

The examination of the [[anterior chamber angle]] is crucial for classifying [[glaucoma]] (Open-angle vs. Angle-closure), assessing the risk of closure, and identifying secondary causes like pigment dispersion or neovascularization.

The angle is formed by the root of the [[iris]], the anterior-most part of the [[ciliary body]], the [[scleral spur]], the [[trabecular meshwork]], and [[Schwalbe's line]] (prominent end of [[Descemet's membrane]]).

## 1. Assessment Methods Overview

The angle can be evaluated using screening methods (Torchlight, Slit-lamp) and definitive diagnostic methods (Gonioscopy, Imaging).

| Method | Type | Principle/Utility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Oblique Flashlight Test** | Screening | Crude estimation of anterior chamber depth. |
| **Van Herick Method** | Screening | Slit-lamp assessment of peripheral anterior chamber depth (PACD). |
| **Gonioscopy** | **Diagnostic (Gold Standard)** | Visualization of angle structures using a special lens to overcome total internal reflection. |
| **UBM / AS-OCT** | Advanced Imaging | High-resolution cross-sectional imaging (useful in opaque media). |

## 2. Oblique Flashlight Test (Eclipse Sign)

This is a simple screening test performed with a pen torch.

*   **Procedure:** Light is shone from the temporal side of the eye parallel to the plane of the iris.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   **Open Angle:** The entire iris is illuminated.
    *   **Angle Closure Suspect:** The iris–lens diaphragm is pushed forward. The light creates a shadow on the nasal side of the iris. This is known as the **Eclipse Sign**.

**Clinical Implication:** A shadow suggests a shallow [[anterior chamber]] and a risk for angle closure.

## 3. Van Herick’s Method

This is a slit-lamp grading system estimating the Peripheral Anterior Chamber Depth (PACD) compared to the Corneal Thickness (CT).

*   **Procedure:** A narrow slit beam is directed at the limbus at a 60° angle. The distance between the posterior surface of the cornea and the anterior surface of the iris (AC depth) is compared to the optical section of the cornea.

### Van Herick Grading System

| Grade | PACD ratio to CT | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Grade 4** | PACD $\ge$ CT | Wide Open Angle |
| **Grade 3** | PACD = 1/4 to 1/2 CT | Open Angle (Closure impossible) |
| **Grade 2** | PACD = 1/4 CT | Moderately Narrow (Closure possible) |
| **Grade 1** | PACD < 1/4 CT | Very Narrow (High risk of closure) |
| **Grade 0** | PACD = Nil (Slit) | Closed Angle |

## 4. Gonioscopy

Gonioscopy is the definitive clinical method to visualize the angle structures.

### Optical Principle
Normally, light rays from the angle undergo **[[total internal reflection]]** at the cornea-air interface because the critical angle is approximately 46°. A [[gonioscope]] (contact lens) eliminates the cornea-air interface by replacing it with a cornea-lens interface (usually with a refractive index similar to the cornea), allowing light to exit the eye and be visualized.,

### Types of Gonioscopy

**1. Indirect Gonioscopy:**
*   Uses mirrors/prisms to reflect light from the angle to the observer.
*   Image is **inverted**.
*   **Instruments:**
    *   **[[Goldmann lens]]**: 3-mirror lens (requires coupling fluid/methylcellulose). Can examine angle, peripheral retina, and central fundus.,
    *   **[[Zeiss lens]] / [[Posner lens]]**: 4-mirror lens. Does *not* require coupling fluid. Excellent for **indentation gonioscopy** (dynamic gonioscopy) to differentiate appositional closure from synechial closure.

**2. Direct Gonioscopy:**
*   Provides a direct view of the angle.
*   Image is **erect**.
*   Requires the patient to be supine (lying down).
*   **Instrument:** **[[Koeppe lens]]**, Barkan lens.
*   **Indication:** Used mainly for surgeries ([[goniotomy]]) and examination under anesthesia (EUA) in children/infants.,

### Structures Visible (Posterior to Anterior)

Use the Mnemonic: **"I Can See The Line"**

1.  **[[Iris]] Root:** The peripheral insertion of the iris.
2.  **[[Ciliary Body]] Band (CBB):** Grey/brown band. Site of uveoscleral outflow.
3.  **[[Scleral Spur]] (SS):** A prominent white line; the attachment site for the longitudinal ciliary muscle.
4.  **[[Trabecular Meshwork]] (TM):**
    *   **Posterior TM:** Pigmented (functional part).
    *   **Anterior TM:** Non-pigmented.
5.  **[[Schwalbe's Line]] (SL):** The peripheral termination of Descemet's membrane. Often demarcated by a pigmented line called the **[[Sampaolesi line]]** in pseudoexfoliation or pigmentary glaucoma.,,

### Grading Systems

**A. Shaffer’s Grading System (Based on Angular Width)**
Most commonly used clinically.

| Grade | Angle Width | Structures Visible | Clinical Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IV** | 35°–45° | Ciliary Body Band visible | Wide Open (Myopia, Aphakia) |
| **III** | 20°–35° | Scleral Spur visible | Open (Closure impossible) |
| **II** | 20° | Trabecular Meshwork visible | Moderately Narrow (Closure possible) |
| **I** | 10° | Schwalbe’s Line only | Very Narrow (High risk) |
| **0** | 0° | None | Closed Angle |,

**B. Scheie’s Grading System (Based on Visibility)**
*(Note: Grading is reverse of Shaffer’s; Grade IV is closed)*
*   **Grade I:** All structures visible.
*   **Grade II:** Ciliary body obscured.
*   **Grade III:** Posterior trabecular meshwork obscured.
*   **Grade IV:** Only Schwalbe’s line or nothing visible (Closed).

**C. Spaeth Grading System**
More detailed, assesses three parameters:
1.  **Iris Insertion:** (A) Anterior to Schwalbe's line to (E) Extremely posterior.
2.  **Angular Width:** In degrees (e.g., 30°).
3.  **Iris Configuration:** (f) Flat, (c) Concave, (b) Bowing, (p) Plateau.

### Pathological Findings on Gonioscopy
*   **[[Peripheral Anterior Synechiae]] (PAS):** Adhesions of the iris to the angle structures (tent-like). Indicates chronic angle closure or uveitis.
*   **Neovascularization ([[NVA]]):** Fine, arborizing vessels crossing the scleral spur (seen in [[Neovascular Glaucoma]]).
*   **Heavy Pigmentation:** Seen in [[Pigmentary Glaucoma]] and [[Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome]].
*   **[[Angle Recession]]:** Widening of the ciliary body band due to trauma (blunt injury).
*   **[[Loch Ness Monster Phenomenon]]:** Loops of vessels visible in congenital glaucoma.

## 5. Advanced Imaging Techniques

Used when media is hazy (corneal edema, leukoma) or for objective documentation.

1.  **[[Ultrasound Biomicroscopy]] (UBM):**
    *   Uses high-frequency ultrasound (50-80 MHz).
    *   Can visualize structures **behind the iris** (ciliary body, zonules).
    *   **Gold standard** for diagnosing [[Plateau Iris Syndrome]] and malignant glaucoma.

2.  **[[Anterior Segment OCT]] (AS-OCT):**
    *   Non-contact, rapid imaging.
    *   Excellent for quantifying angle parameters (Angle Opening Distance - AOD).
    *   Cannot visualize structures behind the pigment epithelium of the iris.
