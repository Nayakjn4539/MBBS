# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Guidelines for assessing dehydration following diarrhoea

### **Assessment of Dehydration in Diarrhoea**

Assessment of dehydration is the most critical step in managing a patient with [[Acute Diarrhoeal Disease]]. The World Health Organization (WHO) and [[IMNCI]] (Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness) guidelines classify patients into three categories based on clinical signs: **Severe Dehydration**, **Some Dehydration**, and **No Dehydration**.

### **1. The "Look, Feel, and Decide" Approach**

Clinicians must look for specific signs and feel for skin elasticity to classify the severity.

#### **Table: Classification of Dehydration Status**,

| **Assessment** | **Column A: No Dehydration** | **Column B: Some Dehydration** | **Column C: Severe Dehydration** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. LOOK: General Condition** | Well, Alert | **Restless and Irritable** | **Lethargic** or Unconscious; Floppy |
| **2. LOOK: Eyes** | Normal | **Sunken** | Very sunken and dry |
| **3. LOOK: Tears** | Present | Absent | Absent |
| **4. LOOK: Mouth & Tongue** | Moist | Dry | Very dry |
| **5. LOOK: Thirst** | Drinks normally, not thirsty | **Thirsty, drinks eagerly** | **Drinks poorly** or not able to drink |
| **6. FEEL: Skin Pinch** (Abdominal skin turgor) | Goes back quickly | Goes back **slowly** | Goes back **very slowly** (> 2 seconds) |
| **DECISION** | If the patient has no signs of dehydration | If the patient has **two or more** signs from Column B | If the patient has **two or more** signs from Column C |
| **Fluid Deficit** (% Body Wt) | < 5% loss | 5 – 9% loss | ≥ 10% loss |
| **TREATMENT PLAN** | **PLAN A** (Home Management) | **PLAN B** (ORS Therapy) | **PLAN C** (IV Therapy) |

### **2. Clinical Features Breakdown**

*   **Fluid Deficit:**
    *   **Mild/No Dehydration:** Loss of < 5% body weight.
    *   **Some Dehydration:** Loss of 5–9% body weight (Fluid deficit approx. 40–50 ml/kg).
    *   **Severe Dehydration:** Loss of ≥ 10% body weight (Fluid deficit approx. 100–110 ml/kg).

*   **Classic Signs of Severe Dehydration (Cholera-like):**
    In severe cases (Stage of Collapse), specific signs include:
    *   **Washerman’s hands and feet** (wrinkled skin due to loss of turgor).
    *   **Scaphoid abdomen** (sunken belly).
    *   **Weak/Absent Pulse:** Rapid, thready, or unrecordable pulse indicating [[Hypovolemic Shock]].
    *   **Oliguria/Anuria:** Urine output decreases or ceases completely.

### **3. Management Protocols (Brief Overview)**

Once the classification is decided, the corresponding treatment plan is initiated immediately.

*   **[[Plan A]] (No Dehydration):**
    *   **Focus:** Prevent dehydration.
    *   **Action:** Give extra fluids (Home Available Fluids like rice water, dal water) and continue feeding.
    *   **Zinc:** 20 mg/day for 14 days (>6 months age) to reduce severity and recurrence.

*   **[[Plan B]] (Some Dehydration):**
    *   **Focus:** Treat dehydration with [[Oral Rehydration Therapy]] (ORT).
    *   **Action:** Give **ORS** (Oral Rehydration Solution) over 4 hours in a health center.
    *   **Volume:** Approx. 75 ml/kg of body weight in the first 4 hours.

*   **[[Plan C]] (Severe Dehydration):**
    *   **Focus:** Rapid intravenous rehydration.
    *   **Action:** **Ringer’s Lactate** (preferred) or Normal Saline IV infusion.
    *   **Volume:** 100 ml/kg (30 ml/kg rapidly + 70 ml/kg slower).
    *   *Note:* If IV access is unavailable and the patient can drink, start ORS immediately while arranging transport.

### **4. Clinical Relevance**

*   **Skin Pinch Test:** This must be performed on the **abdomen** (midway between the umbilicus and the side) or the thigh. The skin and subcutaneous tissue are pinched and released. In a healthy child, it snaps back immediately. In severe dehydration, it "tents" and takes more than 2 seconds to flatten.
*   **Thirst Differentiator:** The most reliable sign to distinguish "Some" from "Severe" is the ability to drink. A child who grabs the cup and drinks eagerly has *Some* dehydration. A child who is too weak to drink or cannot swallow has *Severe* dehydration.

### **Mnemonic: "S.T.A.T.E." of Dehydration**

To remember the criteria for assessment:

*   **S** - **S**kin Pinch (Elasticity)
*   **T** - **T**hirst (Drinks eagerly vs. Poorly)
*   **A** - **A**ppearance (Restless vs. Lethargic)
*   **T** - **T**ears (Present vs. Absent)
*   **E** - **E**yes (Sunken vs. Normal)
