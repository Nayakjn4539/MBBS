# Pneumoconiosis

[[Pneumoconiosis]] refers to a group of lung diseases caused by the inhalation of insoluble dusts, leading to fibrosis of the lungs.

**Crucial Factor:** The size of the dust particle determines the hazard.
*   **> 10 microns:** Settle down from the air.
*   **5 - 10 microns:** Arrested in upper respiratory tract.
*   **3 - 5 microns:** Deposited in mid-respiratory passages.
*   **0.5 - 3 microns:** Reach the alveoli and cause pneumoconiosis.

### 1. Silicosis
This is the major cause of permanent disability and mortality among occupational diseases.

*   **Causative Agent:** Inhalation of dust containing **free silica** or **silicon dioxide ($SiO_2$)**.
*   **Risk Industries:**
    *   Mining (Coal, mica, gold, silver, lead, zinc).
    *   **Pottery and Ceramic** industry.
    *   Sand blasting and metal grinding.
    *   Stone cutting/crushing/quarrying.
    *   Building and construction work.
*   **Pathogenesis:** The particles are ingested by phagocytes which accumulate and block lymph channels. This leads to dense **nodular fibrosis** (3-4 mm nodules).
*   **Incubation Period:** Varies from a few months up to 6 years of exposure.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Onset is insidious.
    *   Irritant cough, dyspnea on exertion, and chest pain.
    *   Impairment of Total Lung Capacity (TLC).
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   Occupational history.
    *   **X-Ray Chest:** Shows characteristic **"Snow-storm" appearance** in the lung fields.
*   **Complications:** [[Silico-tuberculosis]] (Silicotics are highly prone to pulmonary tuberculosis).
*   **Treatment:** No effective cure; fibrotic changes are irreversible. Control is by rigorous dust control and personal protection.

### 2. Anthracosis (Coal Workers' Pneumoconiosis)
Caused by the inhalation of **coal dust**.

*   **Phases of Disease:**
    1.  **Simple Pneumoconiosis:** Associated with little ventilatory impairment. Requires about 12 years of exposure.
    2.  **Progressive Massive Fibrosis (PMF):** Severe respiratory disability frequently resulting in premature death.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Simple anthracosis may be asymptomatic or show little impairment.
    *   PMF leads to dyspnea and severe disability.
*   **Caplan's Syndrome:** A condition where [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]] coexists with rounded fibrotic nodules (0.5 – 5 cm) in the lung, mainly in the periphery.
*   **Legal Aspect:** Notifiable disease under the Indian Mines Act of 1952.

### 3. Byssinosis
Caused by the inhalation of **cotton fiber dust** over long periods.

*   **Risk Industries:** Textile industries using cotton.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Chronic cough.
    *   Progressive dyspnea.
    *   Ends in chronic bronchitis and [[Emphysema]].
*   **Prevalence:** Reported to be 7-8% in textile workers in cities like Mumbai and Ahmedabad.

### 4. Asbestosis
Caused by inhalation of **asbestos fibers** (silicates of magnesium, iron, calcium, etc.).

*   **Types of Asbestos:**
    *   **Serpentine/Chrysolite:** Hydrated magnesium silicate (90% of world production).
    *   **Amphibole:** Contains little magnesium. Includes Crocidolite (Blue), Amosite (Brown). **Crocidolite is the most dangerous**.
*   **Risk Industries:** Manufacture of asbestos cement, fire-proof textiles, brake lining, gaskets, and roof tiling.
*   **Pathology:** Fibrosis is due to mechanical irritation. It is **peribronchial**, **diffuse** (not nodular), and **basal** in location (unlike silicosis which is upper part).
*   **Incubation Period:** Disease usually appears after 5 to 10 years of exposure.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Dyspnea (often out of proportion to clinical signs).
    *   Clubbing of fingers.
    *   Cardiac distress and cyanosis in advanced cases.
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   **Sputum:** Shows **"Asbestos bodies"** (asbestos fibers coated with fibrin).
    *   **X-Ray:** Shows a **"Ground-glass" appearance** in the lower two-thirds of lung fields.
*   **Complications:**
    *   Bronchial carcinoma (High risk if combined with smoking).
    *   [[Mesothelioma]] of pleura or peritoneum (Strong association with Crocidolite).

### Prevention of Pneumoconiosis

Since these conditions are irreversible, prevention is the only cure.

**A. Medical Measures**
1.  **Pre-placement Examination:** Radiological and clinical exam to ensure workers have healthy lungs before employment.
2.  **Periodical Examination:** Regular check-ups to detect early signs.
3.  **Notification:** Notifying authorities about occurrence.

**B. Engineering Measures**
1.  **Dust Control:** Water sprays, wet drilling (to suppress dust).
2.  **Enclosure:** Enclosing dusty machinery.
3.  **Ventilation:** Exhaust ventilation to remove dust.
4.  **Substitution:** Replacing dangerous materials (e.g., using safer insulators instead of asbestos).

**C. Personal Protection**
1.  Use of masks and respirators.
