# [[Thanatology]] > late changes after death

### **Late Signs of Death (Decomposition and Modifications)**

Following the early signs of death (algor, livor, and rigor mortis), the body undergoes progressive destruction. These changes are collectively termed **Late Signs of Death** and are primarily driven by two processes:
1.  **[[Autolysis]]**: Self-digestion of tissues by intracellular enzymes (lysosomes) released after cellular death. It is aseptic and independent of bacteria.
2.  **[[Putrefaction]]**: Breakdown of tissues by bacteria (mainly *Clostridium welchii*, *E. coli*, *B. proteus*) derived from the intestines and external environment.

---

### **1. Decomposition (Putrefaction)**

This is the final stage involving the destruction of soft tissues. The process typically begins **24 to 48 hours** after death.

#### **A. Color Changes**
*   **Greenish Discoloration**: The **first external sign** of putrefaction.
    *   **Site:** Right iliac fossa (over the caecum where bacteria are most abundant).
    *   **Mechanism:** Bacteria produce Hydrogen Sulfide ($H_2S$), which reacts with Hemoglobin (Hb) to form **[[Sulfhaemoglobin]]** (green pigment).
    *   **Progression:** Spreads to the whole abdomen, chest, and eventually the entire body, turning it blackish-green.
*   **[[Marbling]] (Arborescent Markings):**
    *   **Appearance:** A spider-web-like linear branching pattern of greenish-blue discoloration on the skin.
    *   **Mechanism:** Bacteria enter blood vessels and decompose the blood. The stained vessel walls become visible through the skin against the pale background.
    *   **Common sites:** Shoulder, root of neck, thighs.

#### **B. Gas Formation and Pressure Effects**
Bacterial fermentation produces gases (mostly $H_2S$, methane, $CO_2$, ammonia). This leads to **"Gas Stiffness"** or rigidity.
*   **Bloating:** Distension of the abdomen, scrotum, and breasts. The body looks obese ("Giant corpse appearance").
*   **[[Postmortem Purge]]:** Pressure from gases pushes blood-stained frothy fluid out of the mouth and nostrils. **Caution:** Do not mistake this for antemortem hemorrhage or froth of drowning/poisoning.
*   **Faeculant Vomiting:** Gastric contents forced into the mouth/airway (agonal artifact).
*   **Extrusion:** Rectum and uterus may prolapse. In rare cases, a fetus may be expelled from a pregnant uterus (**Coffin Birth** / **Postmortem Delivery**).
*   **[[Foamy Liver]] (Honeycomb Liver):** The liver becomes spongy and full of air bubbles due to gas formation by *Clostridium welchii*.

#### **C. Liquefaction (Colliquative Putrefaction)**
Tissues soften and turn into a semi-fluid mass.
*   **Skin Slippage:** Epidermis separates from the dermis forming blisters containing red serous fluid.
*   **Hair and Nails:** Loosen and can be easily pulled out.
*   **Sutures:** Skull sutures may separate (especially in children).

#### **Order of Putrefaction**
**Mnemonic:** "Li'l Stomach Intestine Spilled Liver Brain Heart, Kidney Bladder Uterus Skin Muscle Bone"
1.  **First to putrefy:** Larynx and Trachea.
2.  **Early:** Stomach, intestines, spleen, liver.
3.  **Late:** Heart, lungs, kidneys.
4.  **Last to putrefy:** Prostate (in males) and non-gravid Uterus (in females). **Medicolegal Significance:** Useful for sex determination in highly decomposed bodies.

#### **Casper's Dictum (Rate of Putrefaction)**
The rate of decomposition varies based on the medium. The ratio of the rate of putrefaction is:
**Air : Water : Earth = 1 : 2 : 8**
*Meaning:* A body decomposes as much in **1 week in air** as it does in **2 weeks in water** or **8 weeks buried in earth**.

### **2. Adipocere (Saponification)**

Adipocere is a modification of putrefaction where fatty tissues are converted into a waxy substance.

*   **Synonym:** Grave Wax.
*   **Mechanism:** **Hydrolysis** and hydrogenation of body fats into fatty acids (palmitic, stearic, oleic acids), which combine with calcium and magnesium to form insoluble soaps.
*   **Required Conditions:**
    *   High moisture/humidity (drowning, damp soil).
    *   Warmth.
    *   Lack of air (anaerobic bacteria like *Cl. welchii*).
*   **Appearance:** Initially soft, moist, whitish/translucent. Later becomes dry, hard, brittle, and yellowish.
*   **Smell:** Ammoniacal / Rancid cheese smell.
*   **Time:** Starts in days; obvious in **3 weeks**; complete in 3–6 months.
*   **Medicolegal Importance:**
    *   **Preserves identity** (features remain recognizable).
    *   **Preserves injuries** (stab wounds, bullet holes remain visible).
    *   Indicates time since death and place of disposal.

### **3. Mummification**

Modification of putrefaction characterized by the dehydration or desiccation of tissues.

*   **Mechanism:** Rapid evaporation of body water before putrefaction can set in.
*   **Required Conditions:**
    *   **Dry heat.**
    *   Free air current (windy).
    *   Absence of moisture.
*   **Appearance:**
    *   Body shrivels and shrinks.
    *   Skin becomes dark brown/black, leathery, and hard.
    *   Adheres to bones.
    *   Weight loss of **60–70%**.
*   **Time:** 3 months to years.
*   **Medicolegal Importance:** Similar to adipocere, it preserves identity and injuries.

### **Comparison: Adipocere vs. Mummification**

| Feature | Adipocere | Mummification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Process** | Saponification (Hydrolysis of fat) | Desiccation (Dehydration) |
| **Condition Required** | Wet, humid, warm, no air | Dry, hot, windy |
| **Mechanism** | Fat converted to fatty acids/soap | Fluid evaporation |
| **Appearance** | White/Yellow, waxy, soft/brittle | Black/Brown, leathery, shriveled |
| **Smell** | Offensive (Ammoniacal) | Odorless |
| **Body Weight** | Little change | Significant loss (60-70%) |
| **MLI** | Preserves injuries & identity | Preserves injuries & identity |

### **4. Skeletonization**

The final stage where soft tissues are removed, leaving only bones.
*   **Time:** Highly variable. In open, accessible areas with animal activity, it can happen in weeks. Buried bodies take years.
*   **Examination:** See [[Forensic Anthropology]] for bone identification.

### **5. Forensic Entomology (Maggots)**

Insects infest the body and aid in decomposition. This is crucial for estimating the **Postmortem Interval (PMI)**.

*   **Flies involved:** *Musca domestica*, *Calliphora* (Blowflies).
*   **Sequence:**
    1.  **Eggs:** Laid in moist areas (eyes, nose, wounds) within **hours** of death.
    2.  **Larvae ([[Maggots]]):** Hatch in **8–24 hours**. They produce proteolytic enzymes that destroy soft tissues.
    3.  **Pupae:** Form in **3–6 days**.
    4.  **Adult Flies:** Emerge in **3–6 days** after pupation.
*   **Medicolegal Importance:**
    *   Estimation of **Time Since Death** (based on the life cycle of the fly).
    *   **Toxicology:** Larvae feed on tissues; drugs/poisons can be detected in the larvae even if the body is skeletonized (Entomotoxicology).

### **Medicolegal Aspects of Late Changes**

1.  **Estimation of Time Since Death (TSD):** The extent of putrefaction, the presence of adipocere/mummification, and insect life cycles are primary indicators.
2.  **Identification:**
    *   **Difficult:** In advanced putrefaction (bloating distorts features, skin slippage).
    *   **Possible:** In Adipocere and Mummification (facial features preserved).
3.  **Cause of Death:**
    *   Putrefaction may mask wounds (tight clothes may simulate strangulation marks) or create artifacts (postmortem purge simulating hemorrhage).
    *   Adipocere/Mummification preserves evidence of violence (scars, bullet holes).
4.  **Place of Death:** Entomological evidence (species of fly) or soil on the body can indicate if the body was moved.
