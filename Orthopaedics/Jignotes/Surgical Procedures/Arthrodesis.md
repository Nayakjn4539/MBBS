# [[Arthrodesis]]

### Definition
**[[Arthrodesis]]** is the surgical fusion of a joint. It involves the artificial induction of joint ossification between two bones via surgery. This creates **bony [[ankylosis]]** to provide stability and relief from pain, sacrificing the mobility of that specific joint.

### Indications
Arthrodesis is indicated when a joint is painful, unstable, or grossly deformed, and motion cannot be preserved or reconstructed.

1.  **Infections (Sequelae):**
    *   **[[Tuberculosis]] of Joints:** Specifically for "unsound ankylosis" where the joint is unstable or painful.
    *   **[[Septic arthritis]]:** Post-infection sequelae leading to painful, destroyed joints.
2.  **Degenerative Disorders:**
    *   Advanced **[[Osteoarthritis]]**: Especially in young laborers where durability is prioritized over mobility, or where [[Arthroplasty]] (joint replacement) is contraindicated or has failed.
    *   **[[Neuropathic joint]] (Charcot’s Joint):** To stabilize a disorganized, unstable joint.
3.  **Trauma:**
    *   Severely comminuted fractures involving the articular surface (e.g., **[[Calcaneal fracture]]**, Pilon fracture) where anatomical reduction is impossible.
    *   Malunited fractures leading to painful arthritis.
4.  **Paralytic Disorders:**
    *   **[[Poliomyelitis]]**: To stabilize a "flail joint" or correct deformity (e.g., stabilizing the foot or shoulder to improve function).
5.  **Deformities:**
    *   Correction of severe **[[Scoliosis]]** or **[[Kyphosis]]** (Spinal fusion).
    *   Correction of foot deformities like severe **[[Flat foot]]** or **[[Congenital Talipes Equinovarus]] (CTEV)**.
6.  **Tumors:**
    *   Following the resection of bone tumors (e.g., **[[Giant Cell Tumor]]**) if reconstruction with a prosthesis is not feasible.

### General Principles of Technique
The goal is to achieve solid bony union in the optimal functional position.

1.  **Exposure:** Adequate surgical approach to the joint.
2.  **Joint Preparation:**
    *   Complete removal of the articular cartilage (decortication) to expose raw cancellous bone.
    *   Removal of fibrotic or infected tissue (in cases like TB).
3.  **Positioning:** The joint must be fused in a **Functional Position** (see table below). This is critical because the position is permanent.
4.  **Fixation:**
    *   Rigid immobilization is required to promote fusion.
    *   **Internal Fixation:** Using screws, plates, or intramedullary nails.
    *   **External Fixation:** Such as Charnley’s compression clamps or Ilizarov fixators (Compression arthrodesis speeds up union).
5.  **[[Bone Grafting]]:**
    *   Often used to fill defects and promote osteogenesis.
    *   Types: **Autografts** (iliac crest/fibula) or **Allografts**.

### Optimum Positions for Arthrodesis
The position of fusion is chosen to maximize function for the patient's daily life.

| Joint | Position of Arthrodesis | Clinical Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Shoulder]]** | **Abduction:** 30°<br>**Flexion:** 25°<br>**Internal Rotation:** 45° | Allows the hand to reach the mouth (Saluting position). |
| **[[Elbow]]** | **Unilateral:** 90° Flexion<br>**Bilateral:** One at 70° (for eating), one at 130° (for hygiene) | Depends on occupation and dominance. |
| **[[Wrist]]** | **Dorsiflexion:** 10–20° | Provides strongest grip strength. |
| **[[Hip]]** | **Flexion:** 5–10°<br>**Abduction:** 10°<br>**External Rotation:** 0–5° | Minimize shortening and allow walking. |
| **[[Knee]]** | **Flexion:** 5–10° | Allows clearance of the foot during the swing phase of gait. |
| **[[Ankle]]** | **Males:** Neutral (0°)<br>**Females:** 5-10° Plantar flexion | Accommodates slight heel in footwear. |

### Specific Types of Arthrodesis

#### 1. Triple Arthrodesis
*   **Definition:** Fusion of three joints of the foot: **[[Talonavicular joint]]**, **[[Subtalar joint]]**, and **[[Calcaneocuboid joint]]**.
*   **Indications:** Stabilizing a paralytic foot (Polio), severe flat foot, or deformities like CTEV.
*   **Procedure:** Often involves wedge resections to correct deformities (e.g., removing a wedge to correct varus/valgus).

#### 2. Spinal Fusion (Spondylodesis)
*   **Indications:** **[[Pott’s spine]]** (TB), **[[Spondylolisthesis]]**, unstable fractures, or severe scoliosis.
*   **Methods:**
    *   **Interbody Fusion:** Fusing the vertebral bodies (Anterior or PLIF).
    *   **Inter-transverse Fusion:** Fusing transverse processes (Posterior).
    *   Often supplemented with instrumentation (Pedicle screws/rods).

#### 3. Charnley’s Compression Arthrodesis
*   Specifically used for the **[[Knee]]** and **[[Ankle]]**.
*   Uses external clamps to apply high compression across the cut bone surfaces, promoting faster union and reducing failure rates.

### Complications
1.  **Stiffness:** Loss of movement is the intended outcome, but it puts stress on adjacent joints.
2.  **Adjacent Joint Degeneration:** Over time, the joints above and below the fused segment develop **[[Osteoarthritis]]** due to increased mechanical load.
3.  **Non-union:** Failure of the bones to fuse (Pseudarthrosis).
4.  **Malposition:** Fusing the joint in a non-functional angle leads to severe disability.
5.  **Growth disturbance:** If performed in children before skeletal maturity (epiphysiodesis effect).

### Clinical Implications
*   **Hip Arthrodesis:** While it provides a stable, painless hip, the major disadvantage is the **inability to squat**. This is a significant limitation in cultures where squatting is essential for daily living (toileting, social customs).
*   **Reversibility:** Arthrodesis is generally irreversible. However, a fused hip or knee can sometimes be converted to a **[[Total Joint Replacement]]** (Arthroplasty) later in life, though the surgery is technically demanding.
