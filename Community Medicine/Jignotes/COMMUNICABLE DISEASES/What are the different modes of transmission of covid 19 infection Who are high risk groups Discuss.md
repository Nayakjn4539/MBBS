# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > What are the different modes of transmission of covid 19 infection? Who are high risk groups? Discuss its prevention.

### **Modes of Transmission of COVID-19**

[[SARS-CoV-2]], the causative agent of COVID-19, spreads primarily through respiratory secretions. Understanding these modes is crucial for breaking the chain of transmission.

**1. Respiratory Droplet Transmission (Direct/Close Contact)**
*   This is the **primary mode** of transmission.
*   Occurs when a person is in **close contact (within 1 meter)** with an infected person who has respiratory symptoms (coughing, sneezing) or is talking/singing.
*   **Mechanism:** Respiratory droplets (>5–10 $\mu$m in diameter) containing the virus reach the [[mouth, nose, or eyes]] of a susceptible person directly.

**2. Airborne Transmission (Aerosol)**
*   Defined as the spread of an infectious agent caused by the transmission of **droplet nuclei (aerosols)** that are <5 $\mu$m in diameter.
*   These particles remain infectious when suspended in the air over **long distances and time**.
*   **Settings:** 
    *   Specific medical procedures that generate aerosols (e.g., intubation, bronchoscopy).
    *   **Indoor settings** with poor ventilation or crowded spaces.

**3. Fomite Transmission (Indirect Contact)**
*   Respiratory secretions or droplets expelled by infected persons can contaminate surfaces and objects, creating [[fomites]].
*   Viable virus or RNA can be found on surfaces for periods ranging from **hours to days**, depending on the environment (temperature/humidity) and surface type.
*   **Mechanism:** Touching contaminated surfaces followed by touching the mouth, eyes, or nose.

**4. Other Potential Routes**
*   **Fecal/Urine:** The virus has been detected in urine and feces, but there have been no published reports of transmission through these routes.
*   **Vertical Transmission:** Transmission from mother to child is possible, typically at the time of delivery.

### **High-Risk Groups**

While everyone is susceptible, certain groups are at a higher risk for developing **severe disease** and mortality.

**1. Biological and Clinical Risk Factors**
*   **Age:** Individuals aged **> 60 years** (risk increases with age).
*   **Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs):**
    *   [[Diabetes Mellitus]]
    *   [[Hypertension]]
    *   Cardiac disease
    *   Chronic lung disease (e.g., COPD)
    *   Cerebrovascular disease
    *   Chronic kidney disease
*   **Immune Status:** Immunosuppression (e.g., HIV, transplant recipients) and Cancer.
*   **Lifestyle:** Smoking is associated with higher mortality.

**2. Vulnerable Populations**
*   In developing countries, vulnerable groups include those employed in the informal economy, older people, persons with disabilities, indigenous people, migrants, and refugees.
*   Pregnant women are also considered a priority group for prevention.

**Mnemonic for High-Risk Groups:** **"OLD CHICKS"**
*   **OLD**: **O**ld age (>60)
*   **C**: **C**ardiovascular disease
*   **H**: **H**ypertension
*   **I**: **I**mmunosuppression (HIV/Cancer)
*   **C**: **C**hronic Lung/Kidney disease
*   **K**: **K**idney disease (Chronic)
*   **S**: **S**moking/ **S**ugar (Diabetes)

### **Prevention and Control**

Prevention relies on a combination of behavioral changes, vaccination, and surveillance.

**1. COVID Appropriate Behaviour (CAB)**
The slogan *"Do gaj ki doori, mask hai jaroori"* emphasizes the basics.
*   **Physical Distancing:** Maintain a distance of at least **6 feet** in public places.
*   **Masks:** Use of face masks/covers is mandatory in public to prevent droplet spread.
*   **Hand Hygiene:** Strict adherence to hand washing with soap and water or alcohol-based sanitizers.
*   **Respiratory Hygiene:** Cover mouth and nose while coughing/sneezing; avoid spitting in public.

**2. Vaccination**
*   Vaccination is voluntary but highly advisable to protect oneself and limit spread.
*   **Vaccines in India:** 
    *   **Covishield** (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19).
    *   **Covaxin** (Whole Virion Inactivated).
    *   **Sputnik V**.
    *   Newer vaccines like **Moderna** (mRNA) and **ZyCoV-D** (DNA based).
*   **Strategy:** Prioritized healthcare workers, frontline workers, and high-risk age groups/comorbidities initially, now expanded to general adult and adolescent populations.

**3. Surveillance and Isolation**
*   **Surveillance:** Using tools like the [[Aarogya Setu App]] for contact tracing and self-assessment.
*   **Testing:** Prompt testing upon observing symptoms.
*   **Isolation/Quarantine:** 
    *   **Isolation:** For confirmed or suspected cases.
    *   **Quarantine:** For contacts (typically 14 days).

**4. Environmental Disinfection**
*   **Indoor Areas:** Office spaces and conference rooms should be cleaned every evening or early morning.
*   **Disinfectants:** If surfaces are visibly dirty, clean with soap/water prior to disinfection. Workers should wear proper [[Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)]].
*   **Biomedical Waste:** Specific guidelines for handling COVID-19 waste (Double layered bags, labeled) to safeguard sanitation workers.

**Clinical Relevance:**
Strict adherence to preventive measures is vital not just to prevent acute infection but to avoid **Long COVID** (Post-COVID conditions), which can affect multiple organ systems weeks or months after recovery.
