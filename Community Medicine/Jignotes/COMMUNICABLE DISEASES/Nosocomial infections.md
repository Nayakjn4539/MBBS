# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Nosocomial infections

### **Nosocomial Infections (Hospital Acquired Infections - HAI)**

**Definition**
An infection originating in a patient while in a hospital or other health care facility. It denotes a new disorder (unrelated to the patient’s primary condition) associated with being in a hospital.
*   **Crucial Criteria:** The infection was **not present or incubating** at the time of admission.
*   **Timeframe:** Infections occurring more than **48 hours** after admission are usually considered nosocomial,.
*   **Scope:** Includes infections acquired in the hospital but appearing after discharge, and also infections among the **staff** of the facility.

[[Nosocomial infection]] is also known as **"Hospital Acquired Infection"**.

### **Epidemiological Determinants**

#### **1. Sources of Infection**
Infection can be **Endogenous** (self-infection from patient's own flora) or **Exogenous** (cross-infection).

| Source | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Patients** | Those suffering from infectious diseases (viral hepatitis, influenza), skin infections (boils, bed sores), or respiratory infections (TB),. |
| **Hospital Staff** | Doctors, nurses, and ward boys acting as carriers (e.g., *Staphylococcus aureus* in the nose, *Salmonella* in the gut),. |
| **Environment** | Dust, linen, furniture, sinks, door handles, and air laden with microorganisms,. |

#### **2. Routes of Transmission**
*   **Direct Contact:** Transfer of organisms directly from the **hands** of a nurse or doctor to a susceptible patient,. This is the **most common route**.
*   **Droplet Infection:** Droplets released from nose/throat via coughing or sneezing,.
*   **Air-borne:** Release of hospital dust or droplet nuclei into the air.
*   **Fomites/Procedures:** Through catheters, IV sets, infected dressings, bed pans, and instruments.

#### **3. Recipients (Susceptible Hosts)**
All patients are potential recipients, but susceptibility increases in:
*   Severely ill patients.
*   Immunocompromised patients (e.g., on [[corticosteroid therapy]]).
*   Patients in **Intensive Care Units (ICU)**, urological wards, and geriatric wards.

### **Common Types of Nosocomial Infections**

The four most common types associated with invasive devices or procedures are,:

1.  **Urinary Tract Infections (UTI):** Most common type (approx. 40%); often associated with catheterization.
2.  **Surgical Site Infections (SSI):** Purulent discharge or abscess at the operative site.
3.  **Pneumonia (Respiratory):** Associated with ventilators (VAP - Ventilator Associated Pneumonia).
4.  **Bloodstream Infections:** Vascular catheter-associated bacteremia/septicemia,.

### **Prevention and Control**

**A. Hand Hygiene (The Gold Standard)**
*   **Hand Washing:** Thorough washing with soap and water or alcohol-based disinfectants.
*   **Importance:** It is the single **most effective** method to prevent nosocomial infections because hands are the most common vehicle of transmission,.

**B. Standard Precautions & PPE**
*   **[[Universal Precautions]]:** Treating all blood and body fluids as potentially infectious.
*   **Barrier Nursing:** Use of gloves, masks, gowns, and eye protection.

**C. Environmental Control**
*   **Dust Control:** Wet dusting and vacuum cleaning (avoid broom sweeping which raises dust).
*   **Disinfection:** Proper sterilization of instruments, bedding, and safe disposal of excreta.
*   **Biomedical Waste Management:** Proper segregation and disposal of infectious waste.

**D. Isolation Policies**
*   Infectious patients must be isolated.
*   Staff with skin diseases, sore throats, or diarrhea should be kept away from work until cured.

**E. Administrative Measures**
*   Establishment of a **Hospital Infection Control Committee (HICC)** to formulate policies.
*   **Antibiotic Stewardship:** Rational use of antibiotics to prevent Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) organisms (e.g., MRSA, MDR-TB).

### **Mnemonics for Students**

**1. Prevention Strategy: "WASH"**
*   **W** - **W**ash hands (Most important!)
*   **A** - **A**ntibiotic stewardship (Use wisely)
*   **S** - **S**terilization & Standard precautions
*   **H** - **H**ospital Infection Control Committee

**2. Common Sites: "SUPER"**
*   **S** - **S**urgical sites
*   **U** - **U**rinary tract (Most common)
*   **P** - **P**neumonia (Respiratory)
*   **E** - **E**ntry into blood (Catheters/IV)
*   **R** - **R**esistant bugs (MDR)

---

### **Clinical Relevance**
*   **MDR-TB & MRSA:** Nosocomial spread of Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis and Methicillin-Resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* are major public health threats originating in hospitals.
*   **Iatrogenic Disease:** Nosocomial infections are often considered [[iatrogenic disease]] (doctor/treatment-generated), such as Hepatitis B following blood transfusion or reactions to drugs.
