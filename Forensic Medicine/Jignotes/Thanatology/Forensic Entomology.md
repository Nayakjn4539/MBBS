### Forensic Entomology

**Forensic Entomology** is the branch of science dealing with the study of insects and other arthropods found on dead bodies to aid in legal investigations, primarily to determine the [[Time Since Death (TSD)]] or Post-Mortem Interval (PMI).

### Classification of Cadaveric Insects
Insects arrive at a dead body in a predictable sequence known as **Insect Succession**.

1.  **Necrophagous Species:** Feed directly on the corpse.
    *   **Diptera (Flies):** Usually the first to arrive.
        *   **Calliphoridae (Blowflies):** Metallic blue/green bottles. Arrive within minutes to hours.
        *   **Muscidae:** Common house fly.
        *   **Sarcophagidae:** Flesh flies (deposit live larvae, not eggs).
    *   **Coleoptera (Beetles):** Arrive later when the body dries.
2.  **Predators/Parasites:** Feed on the necrophagous insects (e.g., Rove beetles).
3.  **Omnivorous Species:** Feed on both the corpse and other insects (e.g., Ants, Wasps).
4.  **Adventive Species:** Use the corpse as an extension of their environment (e.g., Spiders).

### Life Cycle of a Fly (Metamorphosis)
The age of the insect developmental stages present on the body is the primary method for estimating TSD in the early post-mortem period.

**Mnemonic:** **E**very **L**arva **P**eats **A**pples
1.  **E**ggs: Laid in moist natural orifices (eyes, nose, mouth, genitals) or open wounds.
    *   Appearance: 1 mm long, pearly white, "sawdust" appearance.
    *   Hatching time: **8–24 hours**.
2.  **L**arvae (Maggots):
    *   **1st Instar:** Small, vulnerable.
    *   **2nd Instar:** Active feeding.
    *   **3rd Instar:** Voracious feeding; produces proteolytic enzymes to dissolve tissues.
    *   **Pre-pupa (Wandering stage):** Stops feeding and migrates away from the body to dry areas/soil to pupate.
3.  **P**upa:
    *   Outer skin hardens into a capsule (puparium).
    *   Color changes: White $\rightarrow$ Yellow $\rightarrow$ Brown $\rightarrow$ Black.
    *   Duration: **3–6 days**.
4.  **A**dult Fly: Emerges from the pupa.
    *   Total Cycle Duration: **5–6 days in summer**; **8–20 days in winter**.

### Estimation of Time Since Death (PMI)
Entomology provides the most accurate TSD estimate after the onset of [[Putrefaction]], when standard parameters like rigor mortis and algor mortis are no longer valid.

**1. Developmental Analysis (Early PMI):**
*   Based on the oldest immature insect stage found on the body.
*   The age of the larvae is calculated based on the species and the ambient temperature.

**2. Successional Analysis (Late PMI):**
*   Based on the predictable waves of insect colonization.
    *   **Fresh Stage:** Blowflies.
    *   **Bloated Stage:** Flesh flies, house flies.
    *   **Decay Stage:** Beetles, predators.
    *   **Dry/Skeletal Stage:** Mites, moths.

**3. Accumulated Degree Hours (ADH):**
*   Insects require a specific amount of thermal energy to develop.
*   **Formula:** $ADH = (Average Temp - Base Temp) \times Time (hours)$
*   This method accounts for temperature fluctuations at the crime scene.

### Entomotoxicology
The analysis of toxins in insects feeding on a corpse.
*   **Concept:** Maggots bioaccumulate drugs and poisons from the body tissues.
*   **Utility:** Useful when body tissues (blood, liver, urine) are too decomposed or liquid for standard toxicological analysis.
*   **Detectable Substances:** Organophosphates, [[Arsenic]], Barbiturates, Cocaine, Heroin, Mercury, etc.
*   **Effect on Growth:**
    *   **Cocaine/Heroin:** Accelerates larval growth (may lead to *overestimation* of TSD).
    *   **Arsenic/Malathion:** Retards larval growth (may lead to *underestimation* of TSD).

### Collection and Preservation of Samples
Proper collection is vital for accurate analysis.

**1. At the Scene:**
*   **Aerial netting:** To catch adult flies.
*   **Larval Mass:** Measure the temperature of the maggot mass (it is often higher than ambient temp due to metabolic activity).

**2. Preservation Technique:**
*   Collect maggots from different areas of the body.
*   **Divide sample into two batches:**
    *   **Batch A (Live):** Kept on a food source (e.g., raw liver) to rear them to adulthood for accurate **Species Identification**.
    *   **Batch B (Preserved):** Dropped into **hot/boiling water** (to stop growth and straighten them) and then stored in **70-90% Ethanol** or 10% Formalin.
    *   *Note:* Freezing is generally avoided as it can turn maggots black.

### Postmortem Artifacts due to Insects
Insects can alter the body, mimicking injuries or pathology.

| Insect Activity | Mimics/Artifact | Differentiating Feature |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ants** | **Abrasions/Chemical burns** | Hard, brown, parchment-like spots; irregular margins; usually on moist areas (axilla, groin). No vital reaction. |
| **Roaches** | **Drag marks** | Removal of superficial skin layer; no bruising. |
| **Maggots** | **Gunshot wounds** | Maggots create circular boreholes (1-3mm) in skin. Usually clustered in folds/orifices. No hemorrhage or abrasion collar. |
| **Fly excreta** | **Blood spatter** | Regurgitation or defecation by flies on walls/furniture may look like blood droplets. |

### Medicolegal Importance (The 4 P's)
**Mnemonic:** **P**lace, **P**eriod, **P**oison, **P**osture

1.  **P**eriod (Time Since Death): Most accurate method in decomposed bodies.
2.  **P**lace of Death:
    *   Specific species are indigenous to specific geographic areas (e.g., rural vs. urban, indoor vs. outdoor).
    *   Finding a rural insect species on a body found in an urban apartment suggests the body was moved (**Translocation**).
3.  **P**oison (Entomotoxicology): Detection of drugs/poisons in larvae when tissues are liquefied.
4.  **P**osture/Manner:
    *   Presence of maggots in the anogenital region in a fresh body may suggest [[Sexual Offences]] (attracted to semen/blood).
    *   Heavy infestation on the hands/forearms may indicate [[Defense Wounds]].
5.  **Neglect:** Presence of maggots in the wounds or natural orifices of a living person (Myiasis) indicates severe neglect (e.g., in elderly or infants).
