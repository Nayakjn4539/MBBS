# Nipah Virus Infection

**Nipah Virus (NiV)** is an emerging [[Zoonotic Disease]] that causes severe illness in both animals and humans. It was first identified in 1999 during an outbreak among pig farmers in Malaysia and Singapore. It is named after the village *Sungai Nipah* in Malaysia where the patient from whom the virus was first isolated lived.

### Epidemiological Determinants

**1. Agent Factors**
*   **Causative Agent:** Nipah virus.
*   **Family:** [[Paramyxoviridae]].
*   **Genus:** [[Henipavirus]].
*   **Classification:** It is an RNA virus,.

**2. Natural Host (Reservoir)**
*   **Primary Reservoir:** Fruit bats of the family [[Pteropodidae]], particularly species belonging to the **Pteropus** genus (also known as Flying Foxes),.
*   *Note:* The fruit bats harbor the virus but do not show apparent signs of disease.

**3. Amplifying Host**
*   **Pigs** acted as intermediate/amplifying hosts during the initial Malaysian outbreak,.

### Transmission

**Mode of Transmission**
1.  **Animal-to-Human (Zoonotic):**
    *   Direct contact with infected bats or infected pigs.
    *   Consumption of **raw date palm sap** contaminated with infectious bat secretions (saliva, urine) or excretions,.
    *   Consumption of fruits partially eaten or contaminated by bats (e.g., in West Bengal).
2.  **Human-to-Human:**
    *   Close contact with the secretions and excretions of infected patients.
    *   This route was notably reported in outbreaks in **India** (Kerala, West Bengal) and **Bangladesh**, specifically affecting family members and caregivers,.

**Incubation Period**
*   Typically **4 to 14 days**,.

### Clinical Picture

The infection presents a wide spectrum from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory infection and fatal encephalitis.

*   **Initial Symptoms:** Fever, headache, [[Myalgia]] (muscle pain), vomiting, and sore throat,.
*   **Neurological Progression:** Dizziness, drowsiness, altered consciousness, and neurological signs indicating acute [[Encephalitis]].
*   **Severe Presentation:**
    *   Seizures occur in severe cases.
    *   Rapid progression to **coma** within 24 to 48 hours.
    *   Atypical pneumonia and severe respiratory distress (including Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) may occur.
*   **Sequelae:**
    *   Approximately 20% of survivors are left with residual neurological consequences such as seizure disorders and personality changes.
    *   A small number may experience **relapse** or develop delayed-onset encephalitis.

**Case Fatality Rate (CFR)**
*   Estimated at **40% to 75%**. This rate varies by outbreak depending on clinical management capabilities.

### Diagnosis

Diagnosis can be difficult initially due to non-specific early symptoms. Confirmatory tests include:
1.  **Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction ([[RT-PCR]]):** From bodily fluids (throat swabs, urine, CSF, blood).
2.  **Antibody Detection:** [[ELISA]] (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay).
3.  **Virus Isolation:** By cell culture.

### Treatment

*   **Specific Drug/Vaccine:** There is currently **no licensed specific treatment** or vaccine available for Nipah virus,.
*   **Management:** The mainstay of management is **intensive [[Supportive Care]]** to treat severe respiratory and neurological complications.
*   Patients often require hydration and symptom management.

### Prevention and Control

In the absence of a vaccine, raising awareness and reducing exposure is key.

1.  **Reducing Bat-to-Human Transmission:**
    *   Avoid consuming raw **date palm sap**.
    *   Thoroughly wash and peel fruits; discard fruits with signs of bat bites.
    *   Avoid direct exposure to infected bats.
2.  **Reducing Animal-to-Human Transmission:**
    *   Wear protective clothing (gloves, masks) when handling sick animals or their tissues.
    *   Avoid contact with infected pigs.
3.  **Reducing Human-to-Human Transmission:**
    *   Strict [[Isolation]] of suspected cases.
    *   Use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) by healthcare workers and caregivers.
    *   Regular hand washing.
    *   Implementing standard infection control measures in hospitals (nosocomial spread is a significant risk).

### Clinical Relevance
**Recent Outbreaks in India:** Nipah has been reported multiple times in India. A notable outbreak occurred in **Kerala** in May 2018, recording 19 cases with 17 deaths, highlighting the high mortality and need for rapid containment. It was also identified in West Bengal (Siliguri) previously.

### Mnemonic
To remember the key features of Nipah Virus: **BATS**

*   **B** - **B**ats (*Pteropus*) are the natural reservoir.
*   **A** - **A**cute Encephalitis and **A**cute Respiratory distress.
*   **T** - **T**ransmission via Date Palm Sap and Person-to-Person.
*   **S** - **S**upportive care only (No vaccine/drug).
