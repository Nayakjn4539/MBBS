# [[HEALTH PROGRAMMES IN INDIA]] > ICTC should be supported by ARTlink ART Centre

### **ICTC Support by ART/Link ART Centres**

**Rationale for Linkage**
The [[Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre]] (ICTC) acts as the **entry point** or "hub" for the HIV prevention and care continuum. However, diagnosis without treatment is futile. Therefore, ICTCs must be supported by [[Anti-Retroviral Therapy]] (ART) Centres and Link ART Centres (LACs) to ensure the **"Continuum of Care."**

**1. Closing the Gap between Diagnosis and Treatment**
*   **Referral Pathway:** The primary mandate of an ICTC is not just testing but **linking [[PLHIV]]** (People Living with HIV) to care, support, and treatment services.
*   **Preventing "Loss to Follow-up":** A significant number of patients are "lost" between testing positive at an ICTC and registering for treatment. Co-location or strong linkage with ART centres minimizes this gap.
*   **Test and Treat Policy:** With the NACP policy of initiating ART for all PLHIV regardless of CD4 count, the transition from the testing center (ICTC) to the treatment center (ART) must be seamless.

**2. Role of Link ART Centres (LACs) in Support**
Link ART Centres (LACs) are established at sub-district levels (e.g., [[Community Health Centres]]) to decentralize services. They support the ICTC network by:
*   **Decentralization:** They bring [[ARV drugs]] closer to the patient's home, reducing travel time and costs.
*   **Reducing Burden:** They decongest Nodal ART centres, allowing the main centers to focus on complicated cases while LACs handle stable patients referred from ICTCs.
*   **LAC PLUS:** These centers provide pre-ART management as well, specifically designed to reduce the loss of patients between the ICTC diagnosis and the start of Care, Support, and Treatment (CST) services.

**3. Key Functions of the Linked Network**
The collaboration between ICTC and ART/LAC ensures:
*   **Monitoring:** Regular assessment of drug adherence and side effects.
*   **Comprehensive Care:** Management of minor [[Opportunistic Infections]] (OIs) and coordination for [[TB-HIV co-infection]] management.
*   **Retention:** Reinforcing drug adherence on every visit to prevent drug resistance.

### **Clinical Relevance**
In public health practice, diagnosing HIV at an ICTC is a job only "half-done." The patient's prognosis and the community's safety depend entirely on **viral load suppression**. Without an immediate and supported handover to an [[ART Centre]], the patient remains infectious (risk to the community) and progresses towards AIDS (risk to self). This linkage is the backbone of achieving the global **95-95-95 targets** (95% diagnosed, 95% on treatment, 95% virally suppressed).

### **Mnemonic: "MAD" Linkage**
Why must ICTC be supported by ART/LAC?
*   **M** – **M**inimize "Loss to follow-up" between diagnosis and treatment.
*   **A** – **A**ccessibility (Bringing drugs closer to patients).
*   **D** – **D**ecentralization (Reducing load on major hospitals).
