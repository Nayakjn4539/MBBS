# [[Esophagus]] > Dysphagia and Motility Disorders

### Dysphagia and Motility Disorders

#### **I. Definitions**
*   **[[Dysphagia]]:** Difficulty in swallowing resulting from interference or obstruction to the food passage. It can be classified as:
    *   **Oropharyngeal Dysphagia (Transfer dysphagia):** Difficulty initiating a swallow or transferring the bolus from the mouth to the upper esophagus.
    *   **Esophageal Dysphagia:** Difficulty transporting the bolus down the esophagus.
*   **[[Odynophagia]]:** Painful swallowing (indicates inflammation/ulceration).
*   **[[Globus Pharyngeus]]:** Sensation of a lump in the throat without actual difficulty in swallowing.
*   **Aphagia:** Complete inability to swallow.

#### **II. Applied Anatomy of the Esophagus**
*   **Structure:**
    *   A fibromuscular tube approximately **25 cm** long.
    *   Extends from the lower border of the [[cricoid cartilage]] (C6) to the cardiac orifice of the stomach (T11).
    *   **Layers:** Mucosa (stratified squamous epithelium), Submucosa (contains Meissner’s plexus), Muscularis Propria (Inner circular, Outer longitudinal), and Adventitia (fibrous layer, *no serosa*),.
    *   **Musculature:**
        *   **Upper 1/3:** Striated muscle (Voluntary).
        *   **Middle 1/3:** Mixed (Striated and Smooth).
        *   **Lower 1/3:** Smooth muscle (Involuntary).

*   **Physiological Sphincters:**
    1.  **Upper Esophageal Sphincter ([[UES]]):** Formed by the **[[cricopharyngeus muscle]]**. It remains tonically closed to prevent air entry into the esophagus and reflux into the pharynx.
    2.  **Lower Esophageal Sphincter ([[LES]]):** A high-pressure zone (3–5 cm long) at the gastroesophageal junction. It prevents reflux of gastric contents,.

*   **Normal Constrictions:** Important for endoscopy and foreign body lodgment. Distances measured from upper incisors,:
    1.  **C6:** Pharyngoesophageal junction (Cricopharyngeus) – **15 cm** (Narrowest point).
    2.  **T4:** Crossing of Aortic Arch – **25 cm**.
    3.  **T5:** Crossing of Left Main Bronchus – **27 cm**.
    4.  **T10:** Esophageal Hiatus (Diaphragm) – **40 cm**.

#### **III. Physiology of Swallowing (Deglutition)**
The process is coordinated by the swallowing center in the medulla (Cranial Nerves V, VII, IX, X, XII).

**1. Oral Phase (Voluntary)**
*   Mastication and bolus formation.
*   Tongue elevates against the hard palate, propelling the bolus into the oropharynx.

**2. Pharyngeal Phase (Involuntary Reflex)**,,
*   **Nasopharyngeal closure:** Soft palate elevates against **[[Passavant's ridge]]** to prevent nasal regurgitation.
*   **Laryngeal protection:** Larynx elevates; vocal cords and aryepiglottic folds close; respiration ceases (apnea).
*   **Pharyngeal peristalsis:** Pharyngeal constrictors contract.
*   **UES relaxation:** Cricopharyngeus relaxes to allow bolus entry.

**3. Esophageal Phase (Involuntary)**
*   **Primary Peristalsis:** Continuation of the pharyngeal wave; propels food down.
*   **Secondary Peristalsis:** Initiated by distension of the esophagus (e.g., retained food); clears the esophagus.
*   **LES Relaxation:** Opens to allow food into the stomach.

#### **IV. Clinical Evaluation of Dysphagia**

**A. History Taking: The "Surgical Sieve"**,
| Feature | Clinical Implication |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Solids only** | Mechanical obstruction (Stricture, Malignancy, Web). |
| **Liquids > Solids** | Neurological or Motility disorder (e.g., Achalasia). |
| **Progressive** | Malignancy (rapid) or Peptic Stricture (slow). |
| **Intermittent** | Spasmodic disorders (e.g., Diffuse Esophageal Spasm) or Rings. |
| **Regurgitation** | Pharyngeal pouch (undigested food) or Achalasia. |
| **Halitosis** | Pharyngeal pouch or Achalasia (stagnant food). |
| **Aspiration/Cough** | Neurological causes or TEF (Tracheoesophageal Fistula). |

*   **Mnemonic for Dysphagia History:** **"OPEN"**
    *   **O**nset (Sudden vs. Gradual)
    *   **P**rogression (Solids to liquids?)
    *   **E**pisodic (Spasm) vs. Constant (Cancer)
    *   **N**eurological signs (Regurgitation, coughing)

**B. Investigations**
1.  **[[Barium Swallow]] (Esophagogram):** First-line for structural lesions. Reveals strictures, "rat-tail" appearance, diverticula, or corkscrew esophagus,.
2.  **[[Esophagoscopy]]:** Essential to visualize mucosa and take biopsies (rule out malignancy).
3.  **[[Esophageal Manometry]]:** Gold standard for motility disorders. Measures pressure waves and sphincter relaxation.
4.  **24-hour pH Monitoring:** Gold standard for **[[GERD]]**.

#### **V. Esophageal Motility Disorders**

### 1. [[Achalasia Cardia]] (Cardiospasm)
**Defect:**
*   A primary motility disorder characterized by:
    1.  **Aperistalsis** of the esophageal body.
    2.  Failure of the **[[Lower Esophageal Sphincter]] (LES)** to relax during swallowing,.
*   **Pathology:** Degeneration of the Auerbach's (myenteric) plexus leading to selective loss of inhibitory neurons (Nitric Oxide/VIP),.
*   **Etiology:** Idiopathic, Chagas disease (*Trypanosoma cruzi*), or pseudoachalasia (malignancy).

**Clinical Features:**
*   **Dysphagia:** Paradoxical dysphagia (more to liquids than solids initially) or equal difficulty,.
*   **Regurgitation:** Undigested food, especially at night.
*   **Weight loss:** Due to poor intake.
*   **Chest Pain:** Occasionally present.

**Diagnosis:**
*   **Barium Swallow:**
    *   **[[Bird's Beak appearance]]** or "Pencil-tip" narrowing at the lower end,.
    *   Dilated, tortuous esophagus (**Sigmoid esophagus** or Megaesophagus).
    *   Absence of fundal gas bubble.
*   **Manometry:** High resting LES pressure, incomplete relaxation, absent peristalsis.

**Management:**,,
*   **Medical:** Calcium channel blockers (Nifedipine), Nitrates (temporary relief).
*   **Endoscopic:**
    *   **Pneumatic Dilatation:** Forceful dilation of LES. Risk of perforation.
    *   **Botulinum Toxin Injection:** Blocks acetylcholine release; temporary.
*   **Surgical:**
    *   **Heller’s Cardiomyotomy:** Incision of the muscular layer of the LES. Usually combined with a fundoplication (Dor or Toupet) to prevent reflux.

### 2. [[Diffuse Esophageal Spasm]] (DES)
**Defect:**
*   Uncoordinated, high-amplitude, non-peristaltic contractions of the esophageal body ("Tertiary contractions"). Sphincter relaxation is usually normal,.

**Clinical Features:**
*   **Intermittent Dysphagia** (Solids and liquids).
*   **Chest Pain:** Mimics angina pectoris (substernal pain),.

**Diagnosis:**
*   **Barium Swallow:** **[[Corkscrew esophagus]]** or "Rosary bead" appearance due to segmented spasms,,.
*   **Manometry:** Simultaneous, multi-peaked contractions.

**Management:**
*   Reassurance.
*   **Pharmacotherapy:** Nitrates, Calcium channel blockers (Isosorbide dinitrate, Nifedipine),.
*   Surgery (Long myotomy) is rarely indicated.

### 3. [[Nutcracker Esophagus]]
*   **Defect:** Peristalsis is present but contractions are of **excessively high amplitude** (>180 mmHg) and duration.
*   **Symptoms:** Chest pain and dysphagia.
*   **Diagnosis:** Manometry.
*   **Management:** Similar to DES (Calcium channel blockers).

### 4. [[Cricopharyngeal Spasm]]
*   **Defect:** Failure of the [[Upper Esophageal Sphincter]] (cricopharyngeus) to relax during swallowing,.
*   **Etiology:** CVA, Parkinson's, Bulbar polio, or GERD.
*   **Diagnosis:** Barium swallow shows a shelf-like filling defect at the level of C6.
*   **Treatment:** Cricopharyngeal myotomy or dilation.

### 5. [[Scleroderma]] (Systemic Sclerosis)
*   **Defect:** Atrophy and fibrosis of smooth muscle in the **lower 2/3** of the esophagus.
*   **Physiological Effect:** **Incompetent LES** (leading to severe GERD/strictures) and absent peristalsis in the distal esophagus,,.
*   **Clinical:** Dysphagia, severe heartburn, Raynaud’s phenomenon (CREST syndrome),.
*   **Diagnosis:** Barium swallow shows a dilated, aperistaltic esophagus ("glass tube") with free reflux.

#### **VI. Specific Structural Causes Related to Motility**

### 1. [[Pharyngeal Pouch]] (Zenker’s Diverticulum)
**Defect:**
*   A **pulsion diverticulum** resulting from neuromuscular incoordination (cricopharyngeal spasm) causing herniation of the mucosa,.
*   **Site:** Occurs posteriorly through **[[Killian's Dehiscence]]** (a weak spot between the oblique fibers of Thyropharyngeus and transverse fibers of Cricopharyngeus muscles),.

**Clinical Features:**,,
*   Seen in elderly males (>60 years).
*   **Dysphagia:** Sense of food sticking in the throat.
*   **Regurgitation:** Undigested food brought up hours after eating (especially at night).
*   **Halitosis:** Due to food decomposition in the pouch.
*   **Boyce Sign:** Gurgling sound on compressing the neck swelling (usually on the left side).
*   **Complication:** Aspiration pneumonia.

**Diagnosis:**
*   **Barium Swallow:** Demonstrates the pouch. Endoscopy is hazardous (risk of perforation).

**Management:**,,
*   **Endoscopic Stapling Diverticulotomy (Dohlman’s procedure):** Cutting the common wall (cricopharyngeal bar) between the esophagus and the pouch.
*   **External Approach:** Excision of the diverticulum + Cricopharyngeal myotomy.

### 2. [[Plummer-Vinson Syndrome]] (Paterson-Brown-Kelly Syndrome)
**Triad:**
1.  **Dysphagia:** Due to a post-cricoid esophageal web.
2.  **Iron Deficiency Anemia**.
3.  **Glossitis/Koilonychia** (spoon-shaped nails).

**Clinical Implication:**
*   Considered a **premalignant condition** (risk of post-cricoid squamous cell carcinoma),.
*   **Management:** Iron supplementation, dilation of the web.

### 3. [[Schatzki's Ring]]
*   A thin, mucosal ring at the squamocolumnar junction (lower esophagus).
*   Associated with Hiatus Hernia.
*   Causes intermittent dysphagia for solids ("Steakhouse syndrome"),.
