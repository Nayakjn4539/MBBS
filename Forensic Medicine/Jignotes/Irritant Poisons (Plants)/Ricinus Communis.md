# [[Irritant Poisons (Plants)]] > Ricinus Communis

### **Ricinus Communis (Castor Plant)**

**Synonyms:** Castor oil plant, Arandi, Palma Christi.

#### **Physical Characteristics**
*   **Plant:** It is a tall shrub or small tree belonging to the family *Euphorbiaceae*. It has large, palm-like greenish-red leaves with serrated margins.
*   **Fruit:** Green or brown capsules covered with soft spines. They grow in clusters.
*   **Seeds:**
    *   **Shape:** Oval, flattened, slightly smaller than *Croton tiglium* seeds.
    *   **Appearance:** Glossy, smooth surface with **mottled** markings (brown, gray, white, and black).
    *   **Resemblance:** They look like engorged ticks or beetles.
    *   **Structure:** Has a distinct raised appendage at one end called the [[Caruncle]].

#### **Active Principles**
1.  **[[Ricin]]:**
    *   A **[[Toxalbumin]]** (Phytotoxin).
    *   Found in the **seeds** (specifically in the "press cake" left after oil extraction).
    *   It is **Super Toxic** (one of the most toxic substances known).
    *   It is heat-labile (destroyed by cooking/boiling).
2.  **Ricinoleic Acid:** Found in [[Castor Oil]]. It acts as a strong purgative/irritant but is *not* responsible for systemic toxicity.
3.  **Ricinine:** An alkaloid found in leaves.

> **Note:** **Castor Oil** extracted cold is non-toxic because Ricin does not pass into the oil. However, the remaining pulp (press cake) is extremely poisonous.

#### **Mechanism of Action**
*   **Cellular Level:** [[Ricin]] is a powerful inhibitor of **cellular protein synthesis**. It enters the cell and inactivates the **60S ribosomal subunit**, leading to cell death.
*   **Hematological:** Causes agglutination and hemolysis of Red Blood Cells (RBCs) in vitro (less significant in vivo).
*   **Local:** Acts as a powerful gastrointestinal irritant causing severe inflammation, mucosal erosion, and fluid loss.

#### **Fatal Dose and Period**
| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fatal Dose (Seeds)** | **5–10 seeds** (Adults); **2–3 seeds** (Children). <br> *Note: If swallowed whole (unbroken), the hard seed coat prevents absorption, and they may pass harmlessly.* |
| **Fatal Dose (Ricin)** | **1 mg/kg** (Oral); **1–10 $\mu$g/kg** (Injection/Inhalation). |
| **Fatal Period** | **2 to 5 days** (Delayed death is characteristic). |

#### **Clinical Features**
There is usually a **latent period (asymptomatic interval)** of several hours after ingestion before symptoms appear.

**1. Gastrointestinal (Irritant Phase)**
*   Burning sensation in the throat and mouth.
*   Severe nausea and **persistent vomiting**.
*   Colicky abdominal pain.
*   **Bloody diarrhea** (Dysentery-like) leading to severe dehydration.
*   Tenesmus.

**2. Systemic Effects**
*   **Dehydration:** Thirst, dry skin, muscle cramps.
*   **Shock:** Hypotension, rapid feeble pulse, cold clammy skin.
*   **CNS:** Drowsiness, vertigo, delirium, convulsions, and coma (preceding death).
*   **Renal/Hepatic:** Oliguria, anuria, uremia, and jaundice (due to liver necrosis and hemolysis).

**3. Allergic Reactions**
*   Exposure to dust from seeds (in factories) can cause dermatitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma (Castor bean dust is a potent allergen).

**4. Injection/Inhalation (Bio-weapon context)**
*   Severe respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, and rapid cardiovascular collapse.

#### **Treatment**
*There is no specific [[Antidote]] for Ricin.*

1.  **Decontamination:**
    *   **Gastric Lavage:** With warm water or activated charcoal (useful if done early).
    *   **[[Activated Charcoal]]:** Repeated doses to adsorb toxins.
    *   **Whole Bowel Irrigation:** May be considered if seeds are visible on X-ray.
2.  **Symptomatic Management:**
    *   **Fluid & Electrolytes:** Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation to correct shock and dehydration.
    *   **Alkalinization of Urine:** Sodium bicarbonate to prevent renal damage from hemoglobinuria (if hemolysis occurs).
    *   **Pressors:** Dopamine/Noradrenaline for hypotension.
    *   **Dialysis:** In case of renal failure (supportive only, does not remove Ricin).

#### **Autopsy Findings**
1.  **GI Tract:**
    *   Mucosa is congested, softened, and inflamed.
    *   Submucous hemorrhages and erosions (haemorrhagic gastritis).
    *   Fragments of seeds may be found in the stomach.
2.  **Viscera:** General congestion of liver, spleen, and kidneys.
3.  **Microscopy:** Focal necrosis in the liver and kidneys; agglutinated RBCs in vessels.

#### **Medicolegal Aspects**
1.  **Accidental:** Most common. Children are attracted to the seeds because they look like beans or ticks and are colorful. Adults may overdose on herbal remedies.
2.  **Homicidal:** Rare but famous.
    *   **The Umbrella Murder (1978):** Georgi Markov was assassinated in London using a ricin-filled pellet injected via a modified umbrella tip.
3.  **Cattle Poison:** Often used to kill cattle.
4.  **Abortifacient:** Used locally or orally to induce abortion.
5.  **Biological Weapon:** Ricin is classified as a **Category B** biological warfare agent. It can be aerosolized.

#### **Differentiation: Castor vs. Croton Seeds**

| Feature | **Ricinus communis** (Castor) | **[[Croton tiglium]]** (Jamalgota) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Size** | Larger | Smaller |
| **Shape** | Oval/Oblong, flattened | Oval/biconvex, rounded |
| **Surface** | Glossy, **Mottled** | Dull, **Non-mottled** (brownish-black) |
| **Caruncle** | Present | Absent (usually) |
| **Toxicity** | Very Toxic | Highly Toxic |

### **Mnemonic**
To remember the effects of **RICIN**:
*   **R** - **R**ibosome inactivation (Mechanism)
*   **I** - **I**rritation of GIT (Bloody diarrhea)
*   **C** - **C**astor bean
*   **I** - **I**nterval (Latent period before symptoms)
*   **N** - **N**ecrosis (Liver/Kidney)
