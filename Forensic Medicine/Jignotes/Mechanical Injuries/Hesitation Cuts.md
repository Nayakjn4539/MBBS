# [[Mechanical Injuries]] > Hesitation Cuts

### **Hesitation Cuts**

**Synonyms:** Tentative cuts, Trial cuts, Feeler's strokes, Preliminary cuts, Experimental cuts.

#### **Definition**
[[Hesitation cuts]] are multiple, small, superficial, and usually parallel [[incised wounds]] found in the vicinity of a fatal wound. They are produced by the victim on their own body before inflicting the final fatal injury.

#### **Mechanism and Psychology**
*   **Testing:** The victim inflicts these cuts to test the sharpness or edge of the weapon (e.g., knife, razor, blade).
*   **Psychological Barrier:** They represent the initial hesitation or lack of courage to inflict the final lethal wound. The victim makes several attempts to build up the necessary mental resolve to commit [[suicide]].
*   **Pain Threshold:** The person may be testing their own tolerance to pain before the final act.

#### **Characteristics**
1.  **Nature:** They are almost always **incised wounds**.
2.  **Depth:** Usually **superficial**, involving only the skin or subcutaneous tissue. They are rarely deep.
3.  **Position:**
    *   Found at the **commencement** (start) of the fatal wound.
    *   Often merge with the main fatal wound.
    *   Situated parallel to one another and to the main wound.
4.  **Multiplicity:** They are multiple in number, varying from a few to twenty or thirty.
5.  **Grouping:** They tend to be grouped together rather than scattered.

#### **Common Sites (Sites of Election)**
These are found on **accessible parts** of the body where the victim can easily apply the weapon:
*   **Throat:** On the neck, usually at the beginning of a suicidal [[cut throat]] wound.
    *   *Right-handed person:* Cuts found on the **left side** of the neck.
    *   *Left-handed person:* Cuts found on the **right side** of the neck.
*   **Wrists:** Flexor aspect of the wrists (common in self-harm).
*   **Chest:** Over the precordium (heart area), preceding a suicidal [[stab wound]].
*   **Groin/Thighs:** Occasionally seen on the femoral arteries.

#### **Medicolegal Importance**
*   **Diagnostic of Suicide:** The presence of hesitation cuts is virtually **pathognomonic of suicide**. They are almost never seen in homicide (a murderer does not hesitate or test the skin; they strike with force).
*   **Distinction:** They help distinguish suicidal wounds from **homicidal wounds** and **accidental wounds**.
*   **Handedness:** The location of hesitation cuts (left vs. right) helps determine the handedness of the victim/deceased.

#### **Differential Diagnosis: Hesitation Cuts vs. Defense Wounds**

| Feature | Hesitation Cuts | [[Defense Wounds]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cause** | Self-inflicted | Inflicted by assailant |
| **Intent** | To test weapon/gain courage (Suicidal) | To protect oneself (Homicidal attack) |
| **Site** | **Sites of election** (Throat, Wrists, Chest) | **Defensive areas** (Palms, outer aspect of forearms, knuckles) |
| **Nature** | Superficial, parallel, grouped | Irregular, deep, ragged, scattered |
| **Relation to Fatal Wound** | Often merge with or adjacent to fatal wound | Usually distant from the fatal wound |
| **Medicolegal Significance** | Indicates **Suicide** | Indicates **Homicide** |

#### **Autopsy Findings**
*   **External:** Look for multiple superficial cuts adjacent to the main wound. In a cut throat, look for the "tailing" of the wound to determine direction; hesitation cuts are usually at the "head" (start) of the wound.
*   **Weapon:** The weapon (razor, knife) is often found firmly grasped in the hand of the deceased due to [[cadaveric spasm]] (another sign of suicide) or present nearby.
*   **Clothing:** In suicidal stab wounds to the chest, the clothing is often removed or lifted up; hesitation marks will be found directly on the skin.

### **Mnemonic: "TENT"**
To remember the features of Tentative Cuts:
*   **T** - **T**esting sharpness/courage
*   **E** - **E**pidermal/Superficial depth
*   **N** - **N**ear the fatal wound (parallel)
*   **T** - **T**ells it is Suicide (Medicolegal importance)
