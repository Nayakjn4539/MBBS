# Air Pollution and Prevention

**Definition**
Air pollution signifies the presence in the ambient atmosphere of substances (gases, mixtures, particulate matter) generated by the activities of man in concentrations that interfere with human health, safety, or comfort, or are injurious to vegetation and animals.

### Classification of Air Pollutants

Pollutants are broadly classified into two categories based on their origin:

| Category | Description | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Primary Air Pollutants]]** | Emitted directly into the atmosphere from a source. | • Sulphur dioxide ([[SO2]])<br>• Nitrogen oxides (NOx)<br>• Carbon monoxide (CO)<br>• Particulate matter<br>• Lead |
| **[[Secondary Air Pollutants]]** | Formed within the atmosphere by chemical interaction between primary pollutants. | • [[Ozone]] (Ground level)<br>• Peroxyacetyl Nitrate (PAN)<br>• Sulphuric acid mist |

### Sources of Air Pollution

**1. Automobiles**
*   Major source in urban areas.
*   Emit hydrocarbons, CO, lead, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter.
*   Strong sunlight converts these into **photochemical smog**.

**2. Industries**
*   Combustion of fuel generates smoke, [[Sulphur dioxide]], and fly ash.
*   Fertilizer, paper, and steel industries are major contributors.

**3. Domestic Sources**
*   Combustion of coal, wood, or oil.
*   **Tobacco smoke:** Important source of indoor pollution affecting non-smokers via **passive smoking**.

### Indoor Air Pollution
This is a major concern as people spend a large part of their time indoors. The sources can be remembered by the mnemonic:

**Mnemonic: C MORON SCARF**
*   **C** - **C**arbon monoxide (Combustion equipment)
*   **M** - **M**ineral fibres
*   **O** - **O**rganic vapours (Solvents, Glues)
*   **R** - **R**adon (Building materials)
*   **O** - **O**zone (Electric arcing, UV light)
*   **N** - **N**itrogen dioxide (Gas cookers)
*   **S** - **S**ulphur dioxide (Coal combustion)
*   **C** - **C**arbon dioxide (Respiration)
*   **A** - **A**sbestos (Insulation)
*   **R** - **R**espirable particles (Tobacco smoke, Stoves)
*   **F** - **F**ormaldehyde (Carpet adhesives, particle board)

### Indicators of Air Pollution

To monitor air quality, specific indicators are used:

1.  **[[Sulphur Dioxide]] (SO2):** Considered the **BEST indicator** of air pollution. It is produced by burning fossil fuels.
2.  **Smoke or Soiling Index:** Measures the stain on a filter paper through a photoelectric meter.
3.  **Suspended Particulate Matter:** Dust and grit measurement.
4.  **Coefficient of Haze:** Used in the USA to assess smoke/aerosols.
5.  **Air Quality Index (AQI):** An arbitrary index taking into account multiple pollutants (CO, SO2, etc.) to indicate severity.
6.  **Biological Indicator:** **Lichens** are the best biological indicators.

### Health Effects

**1. Immediate Effects**
*   **Acute Bronchitis:** Result of intense pollution.
*   **Suffocation:** In severe cases (e.g., London Smog epidemic 1952).

**2. Delayed Effects**
*   **Respiratory:** Chronic bronchitis, [[Bronchial Asthma]], Emphysema, Lung Cancer.
*   **Neurological:** Lead poisoning affects children's developing brains (loss of IQ).

**3. Global Effects**
*   **[[Greenhouse Effect]]:** Caused by CO2, Methane, etc., leading to Global Warming.
*   **Acid Rain:** Caused by SO2 and Nitrogen oxides.
*   **Ozone Depletion:** Caused by Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).

### Prevention and Control of Air Pollution

The WHO recommends five general principles for control:

**1. [[Containment]]**
*   Preventing escape of toxic substances into ambient air.
*   Methods: Enclosure, ventilation, and air cleaning (using "arrestors" and filters).

**2. [[Replacement]]**
*   Replacing a polluting process with a non-polluting one.
*   Examples: Use of electricity/natural gas instead of coal; use of **unleaded petrol**; replacing steam engines with electric engines.

**3. [[Dilution]]**
*   Valid only within the self-cleaning capacity of the environment.
*   Establishment of **"Green Belts"** (vegetation) between industrial and residential areas.
*   Using tall chimneys to disperse smoke at higher altitudes.

**4. Legislation**
*   Enacting laws like the **Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981** in India.
*   Enforcement of ambient air quality standards and smokeless zones.

**5. International Action**
*   WHO network of laboratories for monitoring air pollution.
*   Agreements like the **Kyoto Protocol** to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

### Disinfection of Air

While difficult, air disinfection is used in specialized settings like operation theatres and wards:

*   **Mechanical Ventilation:** Reduces bacterial density by replacing vitiated air.
*   **[[Ultraviolet Radiation]]:** Effective for operation theatres and infectious disease wards. Must be shaded to protect eyes/skin.
*   **Chemical Mists:** Triethylene glycol vapours are effective against droplet nuclei.
*   **Dust Control:** Application of oil to floors to reduce airborne dust and bacteria.
