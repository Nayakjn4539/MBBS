# [[CONCEPT OF HEALTH & DISEASES]] > Enumerate the determinants of health. How environmental and socio-economic conditions act as determinants of health in a community?

# Determinants of Health

Health is multifactorial. It is not just the absence of disease but the result of interactions between various factors known as the **Determinants of Health**. These factors lie both within the individual (intrinsic) and externally in the society (extrinsic).

### Enumeration of Determinants of Health
The major determinants can be classified as follows:

1.  **Biological Determinants:** [[Genetics]], chromosomal anomalies, errors of metabolism.
2.  **Behavioural and Socio-cultural Conditions:** [[Lifestyle]], habits (smoking, alcohol), customs.
3.  **Environment:** Internal and External (Physical, Biological, Psychosocial).
4.  **Socio-economic Conditions:** Economic status, Education, Occupation, Political system.
5.  **Health Services:** Coverage, accessibility, affordability, and quality.
6.  **Aging of the Population:** Chronic diseases, disabilities.
7.  **Gender:** Women's health issues, social status.
8.  **Other Factors:** Information technology, Science, Human rights.

### Environmental Conditions as Determinants of Health

Hippocrates was the first to relate disease to the environment (climate, water, air). The environment is defined as "all that is external to the individual human host". It is classified into two types:

#### 1. Internal Environment
This pertains to every component part, tissue, organ, and their harmonious functioning within the human system.

#### 2. External (Macro) Environment
This is divided into three components which are inextricably linked:

*   **Physical Environment:**
    *   Includes non-living things like air, water, soil, housing, climate, radiation, and noise.
    *   **Impact:** Lack of sanitation and safe water leads to infectious diseases (e.g., [[Cholera]], [[Typhoid]]). Modern advancements have created new hazards like air pollution, noise pollution, and radiation hazards.
*   **Biological Environment:**
    *   Includes the universe of living things surrounding man: viruses, microbes, insects, rodents, animals, and plants.
    *   **Impact:** These act as disease-producing agents, [[Reservoirs of infection]], intermediate hosts, and vectors. A harmonious relationship is needed; disturbance leads to ill health.
*   **Psychosocial Environment:**
    *   Includes cultural values, customs, habits, beliefs, attitudes, morals, religion, and social/political organization.
    *   **Impact:** Poverty, urbanization, and migration cause stress, anxiety, and frustration, leading to [[Psychosomatic disorders]] like hypertension and coronary heart disease. Favourable social environments provide support and improve quality of life.

### Socio-Economic Conditions as Determinants of Health

For the majority of the world's people, health status is determined primarily by their level of socio-economic development.

#### 1. Economic Status
*   **Significance:** The per capita [[GNP]] (Gross National Product) is the accepted measure of economic performance.
*   **Impact:** Economic status determines **purchasing power**, standard of living, quality of life, family size, and the ability to seek health care.
*   **Irony of Affluence:** While poverty leads to communicable diseases and malnutrition, high economic status is associated with "diseases of affluence" like [[Coronary Heart Disease]], diabetes, and obesity.

#### 2. Education
*   **Significance:** Education, especially **female literacy**, is a key determinant.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Educated women tend to marry later, delay child-bearing, and practice family planning.
    *   Illiteracy creates a vicious circle of poverty, malnutrition, and sickness.
    *   Kerala state in India is a prime example where high literacy led to low [[Infant Mortality Rate]] despite moderate economic income.

#### 3. Occupation
*   **Significance:** Productive work promotes health.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unemployment shows a higher incidence of ill-health and death due to psychological and social damage.
    *   Specific occupations carry specific risks (e.g., Sedentary jobs $\rightarrow$ Heart disease; Coal mining $\rightarrow$ [[Silicosis]]).

#### 4. Political System
*   **Significance:** Health is related to the country's political commitment.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Decisions on resource allocation (percentage of GNP spent on health), manpower policy, and choice of technology shape community health services.
    *   Political will is required to implement health technologies effectively.

**Table: Comparison of Health Impact by Socio-Economic Status**

| Factor | Low Socio-Economic Status | High Socio-Economic Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dominant Diseases** | Communicable (TB, Leprosy), Malnutrition | Non-communicable (CHD, Diabetes, Obesity) |
| **Family Size** | Larger families, High fertility | Smaller families, Low fertility |
| **Environment** | Poor sanitation, Overcrowding | Better housing, Hygiene |
| **Health Access** | Limited access, low utilization | High access, better utilization |

#### Clinical Relevance
*   **Social History:** A physician must take a detailed social history (occupation, housing, income) because a patient living in a slum with poor ventilation cannot be cured of [[Tuberculosis]] by drugs alone; the socio-economic determinant (housing/poverty) must be addressed.
*   **"Causes of the Causes":** Treating a child for diarrhea with ORS is the immediate cure, but addressing the lack of clean water (Physical Environment) and the parents' lack of health education (Socio-economic) prevents recurrence.
