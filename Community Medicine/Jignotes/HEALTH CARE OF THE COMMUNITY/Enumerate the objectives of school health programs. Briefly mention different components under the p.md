# [[HEALTH CARE OF THE COMMUNITY]] > Enumerate the objectives of school health programs. Briefly mention different components under the programme.

### Objectives of School Health Program

The basic aim is to provide comprehensive health care to children of school-going age. According to the [[School Health Committee]] (1961), the specific objectives are:

1.  The **promotion of positive health**.
2.  The **prevention of diseases**.
3.  **Early diagnosis**, treatment, and follow-up of defects.
4.  **Awakening health consciousness** in children.
5.  The provision of a **healthful environment**.

### Components (Aspects) of School Health Service

The tasks of a school health service are manifold and can be broadly classified into the following 12 components:

#### 1. Health Appraisal of School Children
This involves periodic medical examinations and observation of children.
*   **Periodic Medical Examination:** Recommended at the time of school entry (5-6 years) and thereafter every 4 years (at 10-11 years and 13-14 years).
*   **Daily Morning Inspection:** Performed by the [[Class Teacher]] to detect deviations from normal health (e.g., flushed face, rash, acute cold, red eyes).

#### 2. Remedial Measures and Follow-up
*   Medical examinations are useless without follow-up.
*   Special clinics should be conducted for school children at [[Primary Health Centres]] (PHCs) or dispensaries.
*   Referral services to hospitals for specialists must be established.

#### 3. Prevention of Communicable Diseases
*   Planned [[Immunization]] programme against common communicable diseases.
*   Maintenance of immunization records.

#### 4. Healthful School Environment
The school building and site are part of the environment in which the child grows. Minimum standards include:

| Parameter | Standard Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Site** | 5 acres for primary; 10 acres for higher secondary schools. |
| **Structure** | Exterior walls 10-inch thick; heat resistant. |
| **Classroom** | Max 40 students; >10 sq. ft per capita space. |
| **Furniture** | Single desks of **"Minus type"** (zero or plus type are avoided). |
| **Lighting** | Natural light preferably from the **left side**. |
| **Ventilation** | Doors + Windows area should be **>25%** of floor area. |
| **Lavatory** | **1 Urinal** per 60 students; **1 Latrine** per 100 students. |

#### 5. Nutritional Services
*   **[[Mid-day Meal Programme]]:** To provide a supplement (not a substitute) to home diet.
*   **Criteria:** The meal should supply at least **1/3rd** of total daily energy requirement and **1/2** of total daily protein requirement.
*   Administration of **Vitamin A** and **Iron/Folic Acid** prophylaxis.

#### 6. First Aid and Emergency Care
*   Teachers should receive adequate training to handle emergencies (accidents, colic, fainting, epileptic fits).
*   A fully equipped **First-Aid Post** should be provided in every school.

#### 7. Mental Health
*   School is a strategic place to shape behavior.
*   Teachers help prevent maladjustment and **[[Juvenile Delinquency]]**.
*   Focus on relieving academic stress and avoiding discrimination.

#### 8. Dental Health
*   [[Dental Caries]] and periodontal diseases are common.
*   Regular dental examination (at least once a year) and oral hygiene education.

#### 9. Eye Health Services
*   Early detection of refractive errors, squint, and amblyopia.
*   Treatment of eye infections like [[Community Medicine/Jignotes/COMMUNICABLE DISEASES/Trachoma]].
*   **Vitamin A** administration to prevent night blindness and Bitot's spots.

#### 10. Health Education
The most important element. It should cover:
*   **Personal Hygiene:** Skin, hair, nails, clothing.
*   **Environmental Health:** Keeping surroundings clean.
*   **Family Life:** Attitudes towards human reproduction and family health.

#### 11. Education of Handicapped Children
*   Assisting the child to reach their maximum potential.
*   Ideally, integration into normal schools where possible, or special schools for the blind/deaf if necessary.

#### 12. School Health Records
*   A cumulative health record for each student containing identifying data, past history, physical exam findings, and services provided.
*   This record should accompany the child when leaving school.

**Clinical Relevance:**
The **[[School Teacher]]** is the first line of defense in the school health program. They are in a unique position to observe the child daily. Signs like "holding books too close" (vision defects), "inattention" (hearing defects), or "frequent scratching" (scabies/lice) are often first noticed by an alert teacher, leading to early diagnosis and better prognosis.
