# Food Adulteration

Food adulteration is the process by which the quality or the nature of food is reduced through the addition of a foreign/inferior substance or the removal of a vital element. It includes mixing, substitution, concealing quality, misbranding, and the addition of toxicants.

### Common Food Adulterants

| Food Article | Common Adulterant | Health Hazard/Test |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cereals (Wheat, Rice)** | Mud, grits, soapstone bits | Stomach/Digestive issues |
| **Pulses (Arhar Dal)** | [[Khesari Dal]] (Lathyrus sativus), Coal-tar dyes, Metanil yellow | [[Lathyrism]], Carcinogenic |
| **Mustard Oil** | [[Argemone Oil]] | [[Epidemic Dropsy]] (Glaucoma, Cardiac failure) |
| **Turmeric Powder** | Lead chromate powder | Lead poisoning, Anemia, Paralysis |
| **Black Pepper** | Dried papaya seeds | Stomach irritation |
| **Milk** | Water, starch, urea | Reduced nutritive value |
| **Coffee powder** | Chicory, Tamarind seeds | Diarrhea, stomach disorder |
| **Bajra** | Ergot infested grains | [[Ergotism]] |

### Diseases Due to Food Adulteration/Toxins

#### 1. Epidemic Dropsy
This is a condition resulting from the contamination of mustard oil with **Argemone oil**.
*   **Source:** Seeds of *Argemone mexicana* (Prickly poppy) which resemble mustard seeds.
*   **Toxin:** [[Sanguinarine]].
*   **Mechanism:** Sanguinarine interferes with the oxidation of pyruvic acid, leading to accumulation in the blood and capillary dilatation.
*   **Natural Host/Affected Group:** All ages **except breast-fed infants**.
*   **Clinical Picture:**
    *   Sudden, non-inflammatory bilateral swelling of legs (Edema).
    *   Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.
    *   **Cutaneous:** Erythema, flushing, darkening of skin, "Sarcoids" (dilatation of skin capillaries).
    *   **Ocular:** [[Glaucoma]] (due to increased intraocular tension).
    *   **Cardiac:** Tachycardia, dyspnea, congestive cardiac failure (often the cause of death).
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   **Nitric Acid Test:** Add nitric acid to the oil sample and shake. A **brown to orange-red** color indicates the presence of argemone oil.
    *   **Paper Chromatography:** Most sensitive test (detects 0.0001% contamination).
*   **Treatment:** Symptomatic management; stop the consumption of contaminated oil.
*   **Prevention:** Removal of argemone weeds from mustard crops; strict enforcement of laws.

> **Mnemonic:** **SANGUIN**arine causes **SANGUIN** (bloody/red) problems like **Heart Failure** and **Red Skin**. Also, **A**rgemone causes **A**scites (Dropsy).

#### 2. Lathyrism (Neurolathyrism)
A crippling disease of the nervous system caused by the heavy consumption of the pulse *Lathyrus sativus*.
*   **Agent Factor:** The pulse [[Khesari Dal]] (*Lathyrus sativus*).
*   **Toxin:** [[BOAA]] (Beta-oxalyl-amino-alanine).
*   **Host Factor:** Affects active age group (15–45 years), mostly males. Occurs when the diet contains >30% Khesari dal for 2–6 months.
*   **Clinical Picture:**
    *   It is an **Upper Motor Neuron** lesion causing gradually developing **spastic paralysis** of lower limbs.
    *   **Stages of Neurolathyrism:**
        1.  **Latent Stage:** No symptoms.
        2.  **No-stick Stage:** Walk with jerky movement/short steps.
        3.  **One-stick Stage:** Needs one stick for support (crossed gait).
        4.  **Two-stick Stage:** Needs two crutches; severe scissoring gait.
        5.  **Crawler Stage:** Cannot walk; crawls on hands and knees.
*   **Prevention:**
    *   **Vitamin C Prophylaxis:** Daily administration can repair damage/prevent onset.
    *   **Parboiling (Steeping method):** Soaking pulse in hot water and discarding the water removes ~90% of the toxin.
    *   Banning the crop (difficult due to its hardiness in drought).
    *   Genetic approach: Cultivating low-toxin strains.

> **Mnemonic:** **BOAA** acts like a **BOA** constrictor on your legs (causes paralysis). **Lathyrus** makes you **Lame**.

#### 3. Endemic Ascites
*   **Cause:** Consumption of staple food (millets) contaminated with weed seeds of *Crotalaria* (Jhunjhunia).
*   **Toxin:** [[Pyrrolizidine alkaloids]].
*   **Target Organ:** Liver (Hepatotoxic).
*   **Clinical Features:** Rapidly developing **ascites** and **jaundice**. High mortality (up to 40%).

#### 4. Ergotism
*   **Cause:** Fungus [[Claviceps fusiformis]] infesting food grains like **Bajra**, Rye, Sorghum, and Wheat.
*   **Clinical Features:** Nausea, vomiting, giddiness, painful cramps in limbs, and peripheral **gangrene** (St. Anthony's Fire) due to vasoconstriction.
*   **Prevention:** Floating grains in **20% salt water** (ergot floats and can be removed). Safe limit: 0.05 mg/100g.

#### 5. Aflatoxicosis
*   **Cause:** Fungal contamination by [[Aspergillus flavus]] in groundnuts, maize, parboiled rice stored in humid conditions.
*   **Toxin:** [[Aflatoxin]] (Types B1, G1 are most potent).
*   **Risk:** Powerful **hepatotoxin** and liver **carcinogen**. Causes liver cirrhosis and cancer.
*   **Prevention:** Proper storage (moisture <10%).

### Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)

FSSAI is the supreme statutory body responsible for food safety and regulation in India.

*   **Establishment:** Established under the [[Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006]] (FSSA, 2006). It repealed earlier acts like the *Prevention of Food Adulteration (PFA) Act, 1954*.
*   **Ministry:** Works under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India.
*   **Headquarters:** New Delhi.

**Objectives and Functions of FSSAI:**
1.  **Science-based Standards:** To lay down standards and guidelines for articles of food.
2.  **Regulation:** To regulate manufacture, storage, distribution, sale, and import of food.
3.  **Safety:** To ensure the availability of safe and wholesome food for human consumption.
4.  **Accreditation:** Recognition of laboratories for food testing.
5.  **Scientific Advice:** Providing scientific and technical support to the Central Government.
6.  **Information Dissemination:** Creating awareness about food safety and standards.

**Administrative Structure:**
*   **Food Safety Commissioner:** Appointed by the State Government for efficient implementation.
*   **Designated Officer:** In-charge of food safety administration at the district level.
*   **Food Safety Officer:** Responsible for inspection, sampling, and seizing adulterated food.

**Clinical Relevance:**
Doctors must be vigilant about food-borne toxin outbreaks (e.g., clusters of dropsy or paralysis) to alert public health authorities immediately. Diagnosis often relies on recognizing the cluster pattern and dietary history rather than individual lab tests initially.
