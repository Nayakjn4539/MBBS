# Soil-Transmitted Helminths (STH)

**Soil-Transmitted Helminths**, also known as **Geohelminths**, are a group of intestinal parasites that require soil for their development before they become infective to humans. They are a major public health concern, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions with poor sanitation and inadequate water supplies.

The main species infecting humans are:
1.  **Roundworm** (*[[Ascaris lumbricoides]]*)
2.  **Whipworm** (*[[Trichuris trichiura]]*)
3.  **Hookworms** (*[[Ancylostoma duodenale]]* and *[[Necator americanus]]*)
4.  **Strongyloides** (*[[Strongyloides stercoralis]]*)

### Epidemiological Determinants

#### 1. Agent Factors
These parasites share a common characteristic: **No direct person-to-person transmission**. The eggs passed in feces need time in the soil (about 3 weeks) to mature into an infective stage.
*   **Ascaris:** Heavy egg production (240,000/day). Eggs are highly resistant and can survive in soil for years.
*   **Hookworm:** Larvae require damp, sandy, or friable soil with decaying vegetation. They die in dry soil or direct sunlight.

#### 2. Host Factors
*   **Age:** Children (preschool and school-age) are the most vulnerable due to habits like playing in mud and putting dirty fingers in mouths.
*   **Impact:** They rob the host of nutrients, leading to [[Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM)]], growth retardation, and [[Iron Deficiency Anemia]].

#### 3. Environmental Factors
*   **Soil:** Clay soil favors Ascaris; Sandy/loamy soil favors Hookworm.
*   **Habits:** **Open defecation** is the single most important factor for soil pollution and transmission. Lack of footwear predisposes to Hookworm.

### The "Big Three" STHs: Comparative Table

| Feature | [[Ascariasis]] (Roundworm) | [[Ancylostomiasis]] (Hookworm) | [[Trichuriasis]] (Whipworm) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Causative Agent** | *Ascaris lumbricoides* | *Ancylostoma duodenale* / *Necator americanus* | *Trichuris trichiura* |
| **Habitat** | Small Intestine (Lumen) | Small Intestine (Attached to villi) | Large Intestine (Cecum) |
| **Mode of Transmission** | **Fecal-Oral** (Ingestion of embryonated eggs via food/fingers) | **Skin Penetration** (Walking barefoot) by filariform larvae | **Fecal-Oral** (Ingestion of embryonated eggs) |
| **Key Clinical Feature** | [[Loffler's Syndrome]] (pneumonitis), Intestinal Obstruction, Malnutrition | **[[Iron Deficiency Anemia]]**, Hypoalbuminemia, Ground Itch | Dysentery, **Rectal Prolapse**, Growth retardation |
| **Blood Loss** | Nutrients stolen | **0.03 – 0.2 ml/worm/day** | Minimal blood loss |
| **Diagnosis** | Stool Microscopy (Eggs) | Stool Microscopy | Stool Microscopy |

### Diagnosis and Assessment

**1. Stool Examination:** Direct microscopy to identify eggs.
**2. [[Chandler's Index]]:**
This is an epidemiological index used to assess the worm burden in a community (specifically for Hookworm) based on the **average number of eggs per gram of feces** for the entire community.

| Average eggs/gm stool | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- |
| < 200 | Not significant |
| 200 – 250 | Potential danger |
| 250 – 300 | Minor public health problem |
| **> 300** | **Important public health problem** |

### Prevention and Control Strategies

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a comprehensive strategy known as **WASH** (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) combined with chemotherapy.

#### 1. Primary Prevention (Sanitation Barrier)
*   **Sanitary Disposal of Excreta:** Breaking the cycle by preventing soil pollution.
*   **Hygiene:** Hand washing before eating and after defecation.
*   **Food Hygiene:** Washing vegetables and cooking food thoroughly.
*   **Personal Protection:** Wearing **footwear** to prevent Hookworm entry.

#### 2. Preventive Chemotherapy (Deworming)
Periodic administration of anti-helminthic drugs to at-risk populations (preschool/school children, women of reproductive age) to reduce morbidity.
*   **Drug of Choice:** [[Albendazole]] (400 mg) or Mebendazole (500 mg).
*   **Frequency:**
    *   Once a year if prevalence is > 20%.
    *   Twice a year if prevalence is > 50%.

### National Deworming Day (NDD)
A flagship initiative under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India.

*   **Dates:** Observed on **February 10th** and **August 10th** every year.
*   **Objective:** To deworm all preschool and school-age children (enrolled and non-enrolled) to improve their overall health, nutritional status, and quality of life.
*   **Target Group:** Children aged **1 to 19 years**.
*   **Dosage Strategy:**
    *   **1 – 2 years:** Half tablet of Albendazole (200 mg) – crushed and given.
    *   **2 – 19 years:** One full tablet of Albendazole (400 mg) – chewed.
*   **Implementation:** Conducted through Schools and [[Anganwadi Centers]].

### Clinical Relevance & Management

*   **Mnemonic for Treatment:** **"A Me Py"** worms!
    *   **A**lbendazole (400 mg single dose)
    *   **Me**bendazole (100 mg BD x 3 days or 500 mg single dose)
    *   **Py**rantel Pamoate
*   **Anemia Management:** Treating the worm infestation is crucial, but one must also replenish iron stores using Iron Folic Acid (IFA) supplementation.
*   **Cutaneous Larva Migrans:** A skin disease caused by the larvae of animal hookworms (*Ancylostoma braziliense*) wandering in human skin.
