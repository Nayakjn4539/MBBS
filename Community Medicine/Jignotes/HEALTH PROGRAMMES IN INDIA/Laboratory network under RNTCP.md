# [[HEALTH PROGRAMMES IN INDIA]] > Laboratory network under RNTCP

### Laboratory Network Under [[RNTCP]] / [[NTEP]]

The laboratory network under the **Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP)**, now known as the **National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme ([[NTEP]])**, is organized into a **three-tier system** to ensure universal access to quality diagnosis and follow-up.

---

### **Tier I: Peripheral Level – Designated Microscopy Centres (DMCs)**

These are the primary points of diagnosis for the vast majority of patients.

*   **Location:** Established at **Peripheral Health Institutions (PHIs)** such as Primary Health Centres (PHCs), Community Health Centres (CHCs), dispensaries, and hospitals in the public, private, and NGO sectors,.
*   **Population Norms:**
    *   **1 DMC per 100,000 population** in plains.
    *   **1 DMC per 50,000 population** in tribal, hilly, and difficult areas.
*   **Functions:**
    *   Sputum smear microscopy using **Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining** or **LED-Fluorescence Microscopy (LED-FM)**.
    *   Some labs without testing facilities act as **Sputum Collection Centres**.
*   **Quality Assurance:**
    *   Supervised by a **Senior TB Laboratory Supervisor (STLS)**.
    *   **Norm:** 1 STLS per 5 DMCs (or per 5 lakh population, 2.5 lakh in tribal areas),.
    *   The STLS rechecks **all positive slides** and a random sample (usually **10%**) of negative slides to minimize errors,.

---

### **Tier II: State Level – Intermediate Reference Laboratories (IRLs)**

These laboratories act as the nodal centers for the state's laboratory network.

*   **Location:** Usually situated within **State TB Training and Demonstration Centres (STDCs)**, Public Health Laboratories, or Medical Colleges.
*   **Functions:**
    *   **External Quality Assurance (EQA):** Monitoring the quality of the peripheral laboratory network (DMCs) across the state.
    *   **Culture & DST:** Performing culture (using Solid LJ media or Liquid MGIT systems) and Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST).
    *   **Molecular Diagnostics:** Equipped with **Line Probe Assay (LPA)** and **CBNAAT** for rapid detection of drug resistance.
*   **Certification:** They are accredited and certified by the National Reference Laboratories.

---

### **Tier III: Central Level – National Reference Laboratories (NRLs)**

The apex of the network, responsible for setting standards and policy.

*   **Number:** There are **6 designated NRLs** in India,.
*   **Functions:**
    *   **Quality Assurance:** EQA of the IRLs and network labs.
    *   **Surveillance:** Conducting Drug Resistance Surveillance (DRS).
    *   **Research & Training:** Operational research and training of state-level staff.
    *   **Certification:** Certifying state-level IRLs for Culture and DST.

**The 6 National Reference Laboratories (NRLs):**
1.  **[[National Tuberculosis Institute]] (NTI)**, Bengaluru (WHO collaborating centre),.
2.  **[[National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis]] (NIRT)**, Chennai (Supra National Reference Lab).
3.  **National Institute of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases (NITRD)**, New Delhi.
4.  **National JALMA Institute for Leprosy and Other Mycobacterial Diseases**, Agra.
5.  **Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC)**, Bhubaneswar.
6.  **Bhopal Memorial Hospital & Research Centre (BMHRC)**, Bhopal.

> **Mnemonic for 6 NRLs:** "**N**ew **N**ation **N**eeds **J**ustice **R**ight **B**ehind"
> *   **N** - NTI (Bangalore)
> *   **N** - NIRT (Chennai)
> *   **N** - NITRD (Delhi)
> *   **J** - JALMA (Agra)
> *   **R** - RMRC (Bhubaneswar)
> *   **B** - BMHRC (Bhopal)

---

### **Advanced Diagnostic Network (Molecular Labs)**

To support Universal DST (Drug Susceptibility Testing), the network has expanded to include:
*   **CBNAAT (Cartridge Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test) Sites:** Located at District TB Centres (DTCs) and Medical Colleges for rapid detection of TB and Rifampicin resistance,.
*   **TrueNat Sites:** Indigenous rapid molecular test deployed at block/sub-district levels,.
*   **Culture & DST Laboratories:** About 87 labs (as per older data) for advanced phenotypic testing.

**Clinical Relevance:**
The tiered structure ensures that a patient in a remote village has their sputum tested at a local **DMC**. If drug resistance is suspected, the sample moves up the chain to a **CBNAAT site** or **IRL** for molecular testing, ensuring **"Universal DST"**—a key pillar of the [[End TB Strategy]].
