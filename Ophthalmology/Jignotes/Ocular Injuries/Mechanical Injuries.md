# Mechanical Injuries: Blunt Trauma and Concussion

### Ocular Trauma Terminologies
According to the **Birmingham Eye Trauma Terminology (BETT)** system, mechanical injuries are classified based on the integrity of the eyewall ([[sclera]] and [[cornea]]).

*   **[[Closed Globe Injury]]:** The eyewall is intact. Includes contusion and lamellar laceration.
*   **[[Open Globe Injury]]:** Full-thickness wound of the eyewall. Includes rupture (blunt) and laceration (penetrating/perforating).,

### Mechanics of Blunt Trauma
Blunt trauma causes damage through specific mechanical forces affecting the globe.

| Force Type | Mechanism of Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Direct Impact** | Maximum damage occurs at the point where the blow is received (Coup injury). |
| **Compression Wave** | Transmitted through fluid contents, striking the angle of the [[anterior chamber]], pushing the iris-lens diaphragm posteriorly. |
| **Reflected Compression Wave** | Waves reflect towards the posterior pole, potentially causing foveal damage. |
| **Rebound Compression Wave** | Waves strike the posterior wall and rebound anteriorly, damaging the retina/choroid by forward pull and lens-iris diaphragm by forward thrust. |
| **Indirect Force** | Damage caused by forces from bony walls and elastic contents of the orbit. |

*   **Clinical Implication:** These forces can cause **Contrecoup damage**, where the maximum damage is produced at a point distant from the actual place of impact (e.g., macular holes or choroidal rupture from a frontal blow).

### Clinical Manifestations by Anatomical Structure

#### 1. Eyelids and Orbit
*   **[[Ecchymosis]]:** "Black eye" due to loose subcutaneous tissue allowing easy blood collection. Bilateral ring hematomas (**Panda Eye**) suggest a basal skull fracture.
*   **[[Blow-out Fracture]]:** Fracture of the orbital floor (weakest wall) or medial wall due to sudden increase in intraorbital pressure.
    *   **Signs:** [[Enophthalmos]], diplopia (muscle entrapment), infraorbital nerve anesthesia, and **Tear Drop Sign** on X-ray/CT (herniation of contents into maxillary antrum).,,

#### 2. Conjunctiva
*   **[[Subconjunctival Hemorrhage]] (SCH):** Common.
    *   **Head Injury vs. Local Trauma:** In fracture of the base of the skull, the posterior limit of the hemorrhage is *not* visible (blood tracks forward from the orbit). In local trauma, the posterior limit is usually visible.,
*   **[[Chemosis]]:** Edema of the conjunctiva.

#### 3. Cornea
*   **[[Corneal Abrasion]]:** Very painful, diagnosed by fluorescein staining. Heals within 24 hours.
*   **Recurrent Corneal Erosion:** Due to loose attachment of epithelium to [[Bowman's membrane]].
*   **Blood Staining of Cornea:** Occurs with associated [[hyphema]] and raised intraocular pressure (IOP). Cornea appears reddish-brown or greenish. Clears slowly from periphery to center (may take >2 years).

#### 4. Anterior Chamber (AC)
**[[Hyphema]]**: Collection of blood in the anterior chamber.
*   **Source:** Usually tears in the iris or ciliary body vessels (Circulus Arteriosus Major).
*   **Complications:** Secondary glaucoma, corneal blood staining.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Conservative: Bed rest with head elevation (to settle blood), topical steroids, cycloplegics.
    *   Surgical: Paracentesis/washout if IOP is uncontrolled or corneal staining begins.,

#### 5. Iris and Pupil
*   **Traumatic [[Miosis]]:** Initial constriction due to irritation of ciliary nerves.
*   **Traumatic [[Mydriasis]]:** Usually permanent due to sphincter tear (Iridoplegia).
*   **[[Iridodialysis]]:** Detachment of the iris root from the ciliary body. Results in a **D-shaped pupil** and uniocular diplopia (due to a second "pupil" at the periphery).,
*   **[[Vossius Ring]]:** A circular ring of brown pigment on the anterior lens capsule, matching the size of the pupil. Caused by the pupil striking the lens during compression.,

#### 6. Lens
*   **[[Traumatic Cataract]]:**
    *   **Rosette Cataract:** The most typical form. Feathery lines of opacities along suture lines. Can be **Early** (anterior/posterior cortex) or **Late** (1-2 years later, more compact).,
    *   **Subluxation/Dislocation:**
        *   **Subluxation:** Partial zonular tear. Causes **[[Iridodonesis]]** (tremulous iris) and **[[Phacodonesis]]** (tremulous lens).
        *   **Dislocation:** Complete zonular rupture. Lens may fall into the vitreous (posterior) or anterior chamber (anterior).,

#### 7. Vitreous
*   **[[Vitreous Hemorrhage]]:** Most common cause of vitreous hemorrhage in young adults.,
*   **Vitreous Liquefaction:** Synchysis and formation of pigmentary opacities.
*   **Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD):** Anterior or posterior detachment may occur.

#### 8. Choroid
*   **[[Choroidal Rupture]]:**
    *   **Appearance:** Whitish crescent-shaped streak (sclera visible) concentric to the optic disc, usually temporal to it.
    *   **Visual Prognosis:** Good unless the rupture involves the fovea.,

#### 9. Retina
*   **[[Commotio Retinae]] (Berlin's Edema):**
    *   Milky white cloudiness of the retina at the posterior pole due to edema.
    *   **Cherry Red Spot:** The fovea appears red in contrast to the pale edematous surrounding retina.
    *   **Outcome:** Usually resolves, but may lead to pigmentary changes or macular holes.,
*   **Retinal Tears/Dialysis:** Often in the periphery (inferotemporal quadrant is common).
*   **[[Retinal Detachment]] (RD):** Usually rhegmatogenous due to breaks/dialysis.,
*   **Macular Hole:** Traumatic macular edema may rupture to form a cyst or hole.

#### 10. Optic Nerve
*   **[[Traumatic Optic Neuropathy]]:** Direct or indirect injury leading to primary optic atrophy.,
*   **Avulsion:** Optic nerve torn from the back of the eye.

### Traumatic Glaucoma (Secondary Glaucoma)
Blunt trauma can cause raised IOP through various mechanisms (Early and Late).

| Timing | Mechanism/Type | Pathophysiology |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Early** | Inflammatory Glaucoma | Trabecular meshwork (TM) clogging by inflammatory cells/debris. |
| **Early** | Hypertensive Uveitis | Trabeculitis (Posner-Schlossman syndrome). |
| **Early** | Hemolytic/Ghost Cell | RBCs or degenerated RBCs (ghost cells) blocking TM. |
| **Early** | Phacomorphic | Swollen traumatic cataract causing angle closure. |
| **Late** | **[[Angle Recession Glaucoma]]** | Tear between longitudinal and circular muscles of ciliary body. Scarring of TM occurs years later. **Gonioscopy** shows widened ciliary body band. |

### Globe Rupture (Blunt Trauma)
Occurs when blunt force causes a momentary spike in IOP, leading to an "inside-out" injury at the weakest point of the eyewall.

*   **Common Site:** Superonasal limbus (area of Canal of Schlemm) or at the insertion of rectus muscles (thinnest sclera).,
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Hypotony (low IOP) initially.
    *   Deep or shallow anterior chamber (depending on location).
    *   Intraocular contents prolapse (uvea, vitreous, lens).
    *   Hemorrhagic chemosis.

### Mnemonics for Traumatic Cataract Types
To remember the specific traumatic cataracts associated with different injuries:
*   **"Glass-blowers blow heat"**: Infrared rays cause Glassblower's cataract (true exfoliation).
*   **"Don't ROAST the lens"**: **RO**sette cataract is from **A**ccidental **S**tupendous **T**rauma (Blunt trauma).
*   **"Vossius is a Stamp"**: Vossius ring is a pigment 'stamp' from the iris hitting the lens.
