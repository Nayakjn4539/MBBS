# [[Clinical Examination]] > Examination of Peripheral Nerves

### General Principles of Examination

The examination of peripheral nerves must be systematic, following the orthopedic mantra of **Look, Feel, and Move**, followed by special diagnostic tests.

#### 1. Look (Inspection)
*   **Attitude/Deformity:** Specific nerve injuries result in characteristic postures due to muscle imbalance.
    *   **Radial Nerve:** [[Wrist drop]] (inability to extend wrist and fingers).
    *   **Ulnar Nerve:** [[Claw hand]] (hyperextension at MCP joints, flexion at IP joints of ring and little fingers).
    *   **Median Nerve:** [[Ape thumb deformity]] (thumb in line with fingers due to thenar wasting) or [[Simian hand]].
    *   **Common Peroneal Nerve:** [[Foot drop]] (plantarflexion of the foot).
*   **Trophic Changes:** Look for dry, smooth, shiny skin, loss of sweating (anhidrosis), brittle nails, or ulceration in the autonomous zone of the nerve.
*   **Muscle Wasting:** Compare muscle bulk with the normal side (e.g., thenar eminence wasting in median nerve palsy, guttering of interossei in ulnar nerve palsy).

#### 2. Feel (Palpation & Sensation)
*   **Sensory Examination:** Test for pain (pinprick), light touch (cotton wool), and temperature.
*   **Autonomous Zones:** Sensation should be tested in the specific area exclusively supplied by the nerve to avoid overlap error.
    *   **Radial Nerve:** [[First dorsal web space]].
    *   **Median Nerve:** Tip of the [[index finger]].
    *   **Ulnar Nerve:** Tip of the [[little finger]].
    *   **Axillary Nerve:** [[Regimental badge area]] (upper outer arm).
*   **Nerve Thickening:** Palpate the nerve trunks (e.g., ulnar nerve behind medial epicondyle) for thickening (common in leprosy).

#### 3. Move (Motor Examination)
Muscle power is graded using the **Medical Research Council (MRC) Scale**:

| Grade | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **0** | No contraction (Total paralysis) |
| **1** | Flicker of contraction |
| **2** | Movement with gravity eliminated |
| **3** | Movement against gravity |
| **4** | Movement against gravity and resistance |
| **5** | Normal power |

### Specific Nerve Examinations (Upper Limb)

#### 1. Ulnar Nerve (C8, T1)
**Clinical Signs:**
*   **[[Ulnar claw hand]]:** Hyperextension of MCP joints and flexion of IP joints (Ring and Little finger).
*   **Wasting:** Hypothenar eminence and interossei (guttering on dorsum of hand).

**Special Tests:**
1.  **[[Book test]] / [[Froment’s sign]]:**
    *   *Action:* Patient asked to grasp a book/card between the thumb and index finger (testing [[adductor pollicis]]).
    *   *Positive Sign:* Patient flexes the IP joint of the thumb to hold the object (compensatory action of [[flexor pollicis longus]] supplied by Median nerve).
2.  **[[Card test]]:**
    *   *Action:* Patient holds a card between extended fingers while examiner tries to pull it out.
    *   *Significance:* Tests [[palmar interossei]] (adduction). Weakness allows the card to be pulled out easily.
3.  **[[Egawa’s test]]:**
    *   *Action:* Patient places hand flat on table and moves middle finger sideways.
    *   *Significance:* Tests [[dorsal interossei]] (abduction) of the middle finger.

#### 2. Median Nerve (C5-T1)
**Clinical Signs:**
*   **[[Ape thumb deformity]]:** Thenar wasting; thumb lies in the plane of the palm.
*   **[[Pointing index]] (Ochsner’s Clasp):** When clasping hands, the index finger fails to flex (High median nerve injury).

**Special Tests:**
1.  **[[Pen test]] (Abductor Pollicis Brevis):**
    *   *Action:* Patient places hand flat on table, palm up. Examiner holds a pen above the thumb. Patient attempts to touch the pen by abducting the thumb vertically.
    *   *Significance:* Tests true abduction (APB action). Inability indicates median nerve palsy.
2.  **[[Phalen’s test]] (for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome):**
    *   *Action:* Patient flexes wrist fully for 60 seconds.
    *   *Positive Sign:* Paraesthesia/numbness in median distribution.
3.  **[[Kiloh-Nevin sign]] (for Anterior Interosseous Nerve):**
    *   *Action:* Patient attempts to make an "O" shape (pinch) with thumb and index finger.
    *   *Positive Sign:* "Pulp-to-pulp" pinch instead of "tip-to-tip" due to paralysis of FPL and FDP (index).

#### 3. Radial Nerve (C5-T1)
**Clinical Signs:**
*   **[[Wrist drop]]:** Inability to extend the wrist (High radial nerve palsy).
*   **Finger drop:** Inability to extend MCP joints of fingers (Posterior Interosseous Nerve palsy).

**Special Tests:**
1.  **[[Hitchhiker’s sign]]:**
    *   *Action:* Patient asked to extend the thumb.
    *   *Significance:* Inability to extend indicates radial nerve damage.
2.  **Motor Testing:**
    *   Test **Triceps** (elbow extension).
    *   Test **Brachioradialis** (flex elbow in mid-prone position).
    *   Test **Wrist Extensors** (ECRL/ECRB).

### Specific Nerve Examinations (Lower Limb)

#### 1. Sciatic Nerve (L4-S3)
*   **Motor:** Hamstrings (knee flexion) and all muscles below the knee.
*   **Clinical Picture:** [[Flail foot]] (if complete lesion). Loss of sensation below knee except medial side of leg/foot (saphenous nerve territory).

#### 2. Common Peroneal Nerve
*   **Clinical Sign:** [[Foot drop]] (Inability to dorsiflex and evert the foot).
*   **Gait:** High-stepping gait to clear the toes off the ground.
*   **Sensory:** Loss over the dorsum of the foot and lateral aspect of the leg.

#### 3. Tibial Nerve
*   **Clinical Sign:** Loss of plantar flexion (cannot stand on tiptoes) and clawing of toes.
*   **Sensory:** Loss of sensation over the sole of the foot.

### General Diagnostic Signs

#### 1. [[Tinel’s Sign]]
*   **Procedure:** Gently percuss (tap) over the course of the nerve, moving from distal to proximal.
*   **Positive Result:** A tingling sensation (pins and needles) radiating distally into the cutaneous distribution of the nerve.
*   **Clinical Implication:** Indicates the location of nerve regeneration (axon growth cone) or the site of nerve compression/irritation. In recovery, the point of sensitivity advances distally at ~1 mm/day.

#### 2. [[Horner’s Syndrome]]
*   **Context:** Brachial plexus avulsion (pre-ganglionic lesion of lower roots C8-T1).
*   **Features:** Ptosis (drooping eyelid), Miosis (constricted pupil), Anhidrosis (loss of sweating), Enophthalmos.
*   **Implication:** Indicates a poor prognosis as root avulsion is not surgically repairable.

#### 3. [[Sweat Test]] (Starch-Iodine / Ninhydrin)
*   **Principle:** Sympathetic fibers travel with peripheral nerves. Loss of sweating coincides with the autonomous sensory zone of the nerve.
*   **Procedure:** Coating skin with starch/iodine; sweat turns the mixture blue/black.
*   **Implication:** Absence of color change indicates nerve injury (anhidrosis).
