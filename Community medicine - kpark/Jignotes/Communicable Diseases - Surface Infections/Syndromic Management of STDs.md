# [[Communicable Diseases - Surface Infections]] > Syndromic Management of STDs

### Syndromic Management of STDs

**Definition**
[[Syndromic Management]] is a strategy for identifying and treating **Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)** based on the identification of consistent groups of symptoms and easily recognized signs (syndromes), rather than waiting for specific laboratory diagnosis of the causative organism.

**Rationale**
*   **Resource Limited Settings:** In many developing countries, sophisticated laboratory facilities (culture, dark-field microscopy) are unavailable or expensive at the peripheral level (PHC/CHC).
*   **Mixed Infections:** STIs often present as mixed infections (e.g., Gonorrhea with Chlamydia) which clinical diagnosis alone might miss.
*   **Immediate Treatment:** Allows for treatment at the **first visit**, breaking the chain of transmission immediately and preventing complications.
*   **Cost-Effective:** Saves money on testing.

### The Seven Major Syndromes and Color-Coded Kits
Under the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) in India, pre-packed **color-coded kits** are provided free of cost at [[Suraksha Clinics]] and peripheral health centers.

| Kit No. | Color Code | Syndrome Covered | Etiology Covered | Drugs in the Kit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Kit 1** | **Grey** | Urethral Discharge / Anorectal Discharge / Cervicitis | *Gonorrhea, Chlamydia* | Tab. Azithromycin (1g) + Tab. Cefixime (400mg) |
| **Kit 2** | **Green** | Vaginal Discharge (Vaginitis) | *Trichomonas, Bacterial Vaginosis, Candida* | Tab. Secnidazole (2g) + Tab. Fluconazole (150mg) |
| **Kit 3** | **White** | Genital Ulcer (Non-Herpetic) | *Syphilis, Chancroid* | Inj. Benzathine Penicillin (2.4 MU) + Tab. Azithromycin (1g) |
| **Kit 4** | **Blue** | Genital Ulcer (Non-Herpetic) **(For Penicillin Allergy)** | *Syphilis, Chancroid* | Tab. Doxycycline (100mg BD x 15 days) + Tab. Azithromycin (1g) |
| **Kit 5** | **Red** | Genital Ulcer (Herpetic) | *Herpes Simplex Virus* | Tab. Acyclovir (400mg TDS x 7 days) |
| **Kit 6** | **Yellow** | Lower Abdominal Pain / PID | *Gonorrhea, Chlamydia, Anaerobes* | Tab. Cefixime (400mg) + Tab. Metronidazole (400mg BD x 14 days) + Tab. Doxycycline (100mg BD x 14 days) |
| **Kit 7** | **Black** | Inguinal Bubo | *Lymphogranuloma Venereum (LGV), Chancroid* | Tab. Azithromycin (1g) + Tab. Doxycycline (100mg BD x 21 days) |

*Note: All dosages should be verified with current national guidelines.*

**Mnemonic for Kit Colors:**
*   **Grey:** **G**uys discharge (Urethral discharge).
*   **Green:** **G**arden/**G**irls (Vaginal discharge).
*   **White:** **W**ar (Syphilis - Non-herpetic).
*   **Blue:** **B**ad allergy (Penicillin allergy).
*   **Red:** **R**ed hot pain (Herpes).
*   **Yellow:** **Y**elling in pain (Abdominal pain/PID).
*   **Black:** **B**ubo (Inguinal Bubo).

### Management of Specific Syndromes

#### 1. Urethral Discharge in Males
*   **Common Causes:** *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* and *Chlamydia trachomatis*.
*   **Approach:** Treat for **both** organisms simultaneously (Dual protection).
*   **Treatment:** **Kit 1 (Grey)**.
*   **Patient advice:** Partner treatment is mandatory. Abstinence during treatment.

#### 2. Vaginal Discharge in Females
This is the most difficult syndrome to manage because it can be caused by STIs or endogenous infections.
*   **Differentiation:**
    *   **Vaginitis:** Itching, bad odor, frothy/curdy discharge (*Trichomonas, Candida, Bacterial Vaginosis*). Use **Kit 2 (Green)**.
    *   **Cervicitis:** Mucopurulent discharge from cervix (*Gonorrhea, Chlamydia*). Use **Kit 1 (Grey)**.

*   **Protocol:**
    *   If speculum exam **not** available: Treat for both Vaginitis and Cervicitis.
    *   If speculum exam available: Treat specific findings.

#### 3. Genital Ulcers
*   **Differentiate:**
    *   **Herpetic:** Painful, multiple vesicles/ulcers, recurrent. Treat with **Kit 5 (Red)**.
    *   **Non-Herpetic:** Painless (Syphilis) or Painful with ragged edges (Chancroid). Treat with **Kit 3 (White)** or **Kit 4 (Blue)**.

#### 4. Lower Abdominal Pain (PID)
*   **Symptoms:** Fever, lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, cervical motion tenderness.
*   **Risks:** Infertility, Ectopic pregnancy.
*   **Treatment:** **Kit 6 (Yellow)**. Ideally, review after 3 days.

### The "4 Cs" of Syndromic Management
To ensure complete management, the provider must address the 4 Cs:
1.  **C**ompliance: Ensure the patient takes the full course of medicines (Directly observed if possible).
2.  **C**ounseling: Using the [[GATHER approach]] (Greet, Ask, Tell, Help, Explain, Return).
3.  **C**ontact Tracing: Notification and treatment of sexual partners.
4.  **C**ondoms: Promotion and provision of condoms for prevention.

### Advantages and Limitations

**Advantages:**
*   **Scientific and standardized:** Reduces variation in practice.
*   **Immediate care:** Patient is treated at the first visit ("One-stop shop").
*   **Cost-effective:** Saves lab costs.
*   **Comprehensive:** Covers mixed infections.

**Limitations:**
*   **Overtreatment:** Especially in vaginal discharge where non-STI causes are treated with antibiotics.
*   **Asymptomatic cases:** Cannot detect or treat asymptomatic infections (which are common in women).
*   **Misdiagnosis:** Does not identify the exact organism for surveillance purposes.
