# Otosclerosis (Otospongiosis)

### Definition
**Otosclerosis** is a primary disease of the [[bony labyrinth]] (otic capsule) characterized by focal bone resorption and replacement by spongy, vascular, and irregularly arranged new bone,.
*   **Otospongiosis:** Refers to the active, vascular phase where bone is spongy.
*   **Otosclerosis:** Refers to the inactive, sclerotic phase where bone becomes dense.

### Epidemiology & Etiology
*   **Age:** Usually presents between **20–30 years** of age. Rare before 10 or after 40,.
*   **Sex:** Females > Males (ratio 2:1),.
*   **Race:** Common in Caucasians (Whites) and Indians; rare in Chinese and Japanese,.
*   **Heredity:** **Autosomal Dominant** inheritance with incomplete penetrance (approx. 40%),. About 50% of patients have a positive family history.
*   **Precipitating Factors:**
    *   **Hormonal:** Aggravated by pregnancy, menstruation, menopause, or trauma,.
    *   **Viral:** Possible association with **Measles** virus (viral RNA found in footplate),.

### Pathology
The normal enchondral bone of the [[otic capsule]] is replaced by irregular spongy bone.
*   **Site of Predilection:** Most commonly starts at the **[[Fissula ante fenestram]]** (area just anterior to the [[oval window]]),.
*   **Histology:**
    *   **Active Lesion:** Vascular spaces, osteoblasts, osteoclasts.
    *   **Blue Mantles of Manasse:** New bone formation staining blue with H&E stain, seen in active foci,.
    *   **Inactive Lesion:** Dense, mineralized, sclerotic bone.

### Classification / Types
| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Stapedial Otosclerosis** | Most common. Focus at [[Fissula ante fenestram]] causes fixation of the **[[stapes footplate]]**, leading to conductive deafness,. |
| **Cochlear Otosclerosis** | Involvement of the round window or otic capsule around the cochlea. Toxins released into inner ear fluids cause **[[Sensorineural Hearing Loss]]** (SNHL),. |
| **Histologic Otosclerosis** | Asymptomatic. Foci present in the otic capsule but do not cause fixation or hearing loss. Found at autopsy,. |
| **Malignant Otosclerosis** | Severe, rapidly progressive cochlear type leading to profound SNHL. |

**Sub-types of Stapedial Otosclerosis:**
1.  **Anterior focus:** Most common.
2.  **Posterior focus:** Behind oval window.
3.  **Circumferential:** Margin of footplate.
4.  **Biscuit type:** Thickened footplate, annular ligament free.
5.  **Obliterative:** Oval window niche completely filled.

### Clinical Features
*   **Hearing Loss:** Insidious onset, painless, progressive. Usually **bilateral** (70–85%),. Starts as conductive loss, may become mixed.
*   **[[Paracusis Willisii]]:** Patient hears *better* in noisy surroundings. (Reason: Normal people raise their voices in noise, overcoming the patient's conductive threshold),.
*   **Tinnitus:** Seen in 75% of cases; more common in active or cochlear lesions,.
*   **Speech:** Monotonous, soft voice (patient hears their own voice loudly via bone conduction),.
*   **Vertigo:** Uncommon, but may occur.

### Signs and Examination
*   **Tympanic Membrane (TM):** Usually normal and mobile.
*   **[[Schwartze Sign]] (Flamingo Pink Sign):** A reddish hue seen on the promontory through the TM. It indicates **active otosclerosis** (increased vascularity),,.
*   **Eustachian Tube:** Normal function.

### Investigations

#### 1. Tuning Fork Tests
*   **[[Rinne Test]]:** **Negative** (BC > AC) for 256, 512, and 1024 Hz as disease progresses,.
*   **[[Weber Test]]:** Lateralizes to the **worse ear** (in CHL),.
*   **[[Gelle's Test]]:** **Negative**. No change in hearing when pressure is altered in the EAC (indicates ossicular fixation),.
*   **[[Absolute Bone Conduction]] (ABC):** Normal (unless cochlear involvement).

#### 2. Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA)
*   **Low-frequency Conductive Hearing Loss:** Rising curve initially, later becomes flat.
*   **[[Carhart's Notch]]:** A characteristic dip in the **Bone Conduction** curve centered at **2000 Hz** (2 kHz),.
    *   *Pathophysiology:* It is a mechanical artifact caused by the loss of the inertial component of bone conduction due to stapes fixation.
    *   *Depth:* 5 dB at 500 Hz, 10 dB at 1000 Hz, **15 dB at 2000 Hz**, 5 dB at 4000 Hz.
    *   *Clinical Implication:* It often disappears after successful surgery.
*   **Cookie-bite curve:** Seen in mixed loss or cochlear otosclerosis.

#### 3. Impedance Audiometry
*   **Tympanogram:** **[[Type As]]** (Normal pressure, low compliance/stiffness),.
*   **[[Stapedial Reflex]]:** **Absent** (due to fixed footplate),. Early sign: "Diphasic" or "On-off" effect.

#### 4. Radiology (CT Scan)
*   **[[Halo Sign]] (Double Ring Sign):** Seen on HRCT temporal bone in cochlear otosclerosis. It is a ring of radiolucency around the cochlea due to demineralization,.

### Differential Diagnosis
| Condition | Differentiating Feature |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Tympanosclerosis]]** | White chalky plaques on TM; h/o previous discharge/infection. |
| **[[Ossicular Discontinuity]]** | History of trauma; **Type Ad** (hyper-compliant) tympanogram. |
| **[[Superior Semicircular Canal Dehiscence]]** | Tullio phenomenon (vertigo with loud sound); CT confirmation. |
| **[[Paget's Disease]]** | Affects older age; other bones involved. |
| **[[Osteogenesis Imperfecta]]** | Blue sclera + brittle bones + deafness (**[[Van der Hoeve Syndrome]]**),. |

### Treatment

#### A. Medical Management
Used for **active** otosclerosis (Schwartze sign positive) or cochlear otosclerosis to arrest progression.
*   **[[Sodium Fluoride]]:** Reduces osteoclastic activity and promotes bone maturation,.
    *   *Dosage:* 20–120 mg/day (often given with Calcium and Vitamin D).
*   **Bisphosphonates:** Inhibit bone resorption.

#### B. Hearing Aids
*   Indicated if surgery is contraindicated, refused, or in cases of early mild loss.

#### C. Surgical Management
**Procedure of Choice:** **[[Stapedotomy]]** (Small fenestra stapedectomy),.
*   **Principle:** The fixed stapes superstructure is removed, a small hole (fenestra) is created in the footplate, and a **[[Teflon piston]]** (prosthesis) is placed connecting the incus to the vestibule,.
*   **Indications:**
    *   Air-Bone gap > 15 dB.
    *   Good speech discrimination.
    *   Negative Rinne test.
*   **Contraindications:**
    *   **Only hearing ear** (Absolute contraindication).
    *   Active otosclerosis (Schwartze sign present).
    *   Meniere’s disease.
    *   Pregnancy.
    *   Young children (Eustachian tube dysfunction risk).

**Steps of Stapedotomy:**
1.  Permeatal approach (Rosen's incision).
2.  Elevation of tympanomeatal flap.
3.  Confirmation of stapes fixation.
4.  Removal of stapes superstructure.
5.  Fenestration of footplate (using micro-drill or laser).
6.  Placement of prosthesis (Teflon piston).
7.  Sealing with fat/gelfoam.

**Complications of Surgery:**
*   **Intra-operative:** Floating footplate, depressed footplate, tympanic membrane tear, facial nerve injury, perilymph gusher.
*   **Post-operative:**
    *   **[[Perilymph Fistula]]:** Causes vertigo and fluctuating SNHL.
    *   **Dead Ear:** Profound SNHL (<1% risk).
    *   **Facial Palsy:** Immediate (trauma) or delayed (edema).
    *   **Reparative Granuloma:** Rare, causes SNHL and vertigo.
    *   **Dysgeusia:** Damage to Chorda Tympani nerve.

### Mnemonics
*   **Van der Hoeve Syndrome:** **O**steogenesis imperfecta + **O**tosclerosis + **O**cular (Blue sclera).
*   **Carhart's Notch:** **C**arhart's **B**one **C**onduction (CBC) dip at **2000** (2k) Hz.
