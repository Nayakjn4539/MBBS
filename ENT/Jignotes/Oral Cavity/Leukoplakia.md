# [[Oral Cavity]] > Leukoplakia

### **Leukoplakia**

**Leukoplakia** is the most common premalignant lesion of the [[oral cavity]]. It is a clinical term, not a histological diagnosis, and remains a diagnosis of exclusion.

**Definition (WHO)**
It is defined as a clinical white patch or plaque that cannot be rubbed off and cannot be characterized clinically or pathologically as any other disease.

---

### **Epidemiology**
*   **Prevalence:** It is the most common premalignant lesion of the oral mucosa.
*   **Age:** Most commonly seen in the **fourth decade** of life and older.
*   **Sex:** Males are affected two to three times more frequently than females.

---

### **Etiology and Risk Factors**
The exact etiology is unknown, but several factors are implicated:

1.  **Tobacco:**
    *   **Smoking:** Incidence is 6 times higher in smokers. Pipe smoking is associated with lip leukoplakia.
    *   **Smokeless Tobacco:** Chewing tobacco, [[betel nut]] (paan), and snuff are major risk factors.
    *   **Reverse Smoking:** Common in certain parts of India (e.g., Andhra Pradesh), associated with palatal changes.
2.  **Alcohol:** especially harmful when combined with smoking (synergistic effect).
3.  **Chronic Irritation (Frictional Keratosis):**
    *   Caused by sharp jagged teeth, ill-fitting dentures, or cheek biting.
    *   *Note:* Purely friction-induced hyperkeratosis is not true leukoplakia and reverses upon removal of the cause.
4.  **Candidiasis:** Chronic hyperplastic candidiasis (Candidal Leukoplakia).
5.  **Nutritional Deficiency:** Vitamin A, B12, Iron ([[Plummer-Vinson syndrome]]).
6.  **Viral:** [[Human Papillomavirus]] (HPV) subtypes 16 and 18.
7.  **Sanguinaria:** Herbal extract in some toothpastes/mouthwashes can cause "sanguinaria-associated keratosis" on the maxillary vestibule.
8.  **Ultraviolet Radiation:** Risk factor for leukoplakia of the lower lip ([[Actinic Cheilitis]]).

### **Clinical Features**

**Sites Involved**
*   **Buccal Mucosa:** Most common site (especially in India).
*   **Oral Commissures** (Angle of mouth).
*   **Alveolar Mucosa**.
*   **Tongue:** Lateral borders and ventral surface.
*   **Floor of Mouth:** High-risk site for malignancy.
*   **Lip:** Vermilion border.

**Appearance**
*   Color varies from white, gray, to yellowish-white.
*   Texture can be smooth, wrinkled, fissured, leathery, or granular.
*   Margins may be well-demarcated or ill-defined.

### **Classification of Leukoplakia**

Leukoplakia is broadly classified into two clinical types based on appearance:

#### **1. Homogenous Leukoplakia (Thin/Simplex)**
*   **Appearance:** Uniform, flat, thin, smooth, or slightly wrinkled white patch.
*   **Texture:** Can become leathery or fissured over time.
*   **Risk:** Less often associated with malignancy; usually benign or shows minimal dysplasia.

#### **2. Non-Homogenous Leukoplakia**
These carry a significantly **higher risk** of malignant transformation.
*   **Nodular (Speckled) Leukoplakia:** White patches or nodules on an erythematous (red) base.
*   **Erythroleukoplakia:** A mix of leukoplakia (white) and [[erythroplakia]] (red). The red components represent areas of atrophy or immature cells, indicating a higher likelihood of dysplasia or carcinoma.
*   **Verrucous (Proliferative Verrucous Leukoplakia - PVL):**
    *   Aggressive form, more common in women.
    *   Starts as a thin white patch, progresses to a thick, warty (exophytic) growth.
    *   High recurrence rate and high risk of developing [[Squamous Cell Carcinoma]] (up to 70%).

### **Histopathology**

Biopsy is mandatory to grade the lesion. Features include:
1.  **Hyperkeratosis:** Thickening of the stratum corneum (keratin layer).
2.  **Acanthosis:** Thickening of the spinous layer.
3.  **Dysplasia:** Disordered cell growth and maturation. It is graded as:
    *   **Mild Dysplasia:** Alterations limited to the basal 1/3 of epithelium.
    *   **Moderate Dysplasia:** Involves basal 1/2 of epithelium.
    *   **Severe Dysplasia:** Involves more than 2/3 of epithelium.
    *   **Carcinoma in Situ (CIS):** Dysplasia involving the entire thickness of the epithelium ("top-to-bottom" effect) but *without* invasion of the basement membrane.

**Clinical Implication:**
Induration (hardness) on palpation is a ominous sign suggesting malignant infiltration into underlying tissues.

### **Malignant Transformation**

The potential for leukoplakia to transform into [[Oral Cancer]] ranges from **1% to 17.5%** (average ~5%).

**High-Risk Factors for Malignancy:**
*   **Type:** Erythroleukoplakia (speckled) and Proliferative Verrucous Leukoplakia (PVL).
*   **Site:** Floor of mouth and ventral surface of tongue (highest risk).
*   **Appearance:** Non-homogenous lesions.
*   **Histology:** Presence of high-grade dysplasia.
*   **Duration:** Long-standing lesions.
*   **Patient:** Non-smokers with leukoplakia (paradoxically have a higher risk of transformation than smokers).

### **Differential Diagnosis**

Many white lesions mimic leukoplakia. These must be ruled out before making a diagnosis.

| Condition | Distinguishing Feature |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Oral Lichen Planus]]** | Bilateral, reticular (Wickham's striae), lace-like pattern. |
| **[[Candidiasis]]** (Thrush) | Curdy white patch that **can be wiped off**, leaving a red bleeding surface. |
| **[[Chemical Burn]]** | History of aspirin or caustic agent placement; painful. |
| **Leukoedema** | Diffuse milky opacification; disappears on stretching the mucosa. |
| **[[Oral Hairy Leukoplakia]]** | Vertical corrugations on lateral border of tongue; associated with **[[HIV]]** and **[[Epstein-Barr Virus]]**. |
| **[[Cheek Bite]] (Morsicatio)** | Shaggy, rough surface along the occlusal line; history of habit. |
| **White Sponge Nevus** | Congenital, bilateral, thick spongy folds; family history. |

### **Diagnosis**

1.  **Clinical Examination:** Inspect site, size, texture, and palpate for induration.
2.  **Biopsy:** **Gold Standard.**
    *   **Incisional Biopsy:** For large lesions. Take from the most suspicious area (red, ulcerated, or indurated areas).
    *   **Excisional Biopsy:** For small lesions.
3.  **Supravital Staining (Toluidine Blue):**
    *   Dye is applied to the lesion and washed with saline.
    *   **Positive:** Dysplastic cells/CIS/Carcinoma retain the blue dye (stain dark blue) due to high nuclear content.
    *   **Negative:** Benign leukoplakia usually does not take up the dye.
    *   *Use:* Helps select the best site for biopsy.

### **Treatment**

**1. Conservative Management**
*   **Eliminate Irritants:** Cessation of smoking, tobacco chewing, and alcohol.
*   **Dental Correction:** Treat sharp teeth or ill-fitting dentures.
*   **Observation:** Homogenous leukoplakia may regress spontaneously after removing the cause. Regular follow-up is essential.

**2. Medical Management (Chemoprevention)**
*   Used for extensive lesions or mild dysplasia where surgery is not feasible.
*   **Agents:** Vitamin A (Retinoids), Beta-carotene (Antioxidants), Vitamin E, Lycopene.
*   *Note:* Lesions often recur upon cessation of therapy.

**3. Surgical Management**
Indicated for moderate to severe dysplasia, non-homogenous lesions, or lesions that persist despite conservative care.
*   **Surgical Excision:** Cold knife excision (preferred for histopathologic clearance).
*   **[[Laser Surgery]]:** [[CO2 Laser]] or KTP laser vaporization. Advantages: Precision, hemostasis, less scarring.
*   **Cryosurgery:** Freezing the lesion (Cryoablation).
*   **Electrocautery**.
