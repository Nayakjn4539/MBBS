# [[Nutrition And Health]] > Iodine Deficiency Disorders

### Iodine Deficiency Disorders (IDD)

**Iodine Deficiency Disorders (IDD)** refers to a broad spectrum of pathological conditions resulting from a lack of iodine in the diet, ranging from goiter to severe mental retardation. It is currently the world's single most significant cause of **preventable brain damage**.

### Nutritional Basics
*   **Role of Iodine:** Essential micronutrient required for the synthesis of Thyroid Hormones: Thyroxine (T4) and Tri-iodothyronine (T3). These are crucial for physical growth and mental development.
*   **Total Body Content:** An adult body contains about 50 mg of iodine.
*   **Daily Requirements:** [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]]
    *   **Preschool Children (0–59 months):** 90 mcg
    *   **School Children (6–12 years):** 120 mcg
    *   **Adults (>12 years):** 150 mcg
    *   **Pregnancy & Lactation:** 250 mcg

### Epidemiological Determinants

#### 1. Agent Factors
*   **Primary Cause:** Dietary deficiency of iodine.
*   **Goitrogens:** Chemical substances that interfere with iodine utilization by the thyroid gland.
    *   **Sources:** Brassica group of vegetables (Cabbage, Cauliflower), Maize, Bamboo shoots, Sweet potatoes (Cassava/Tapioca), and Pearl millet.
    *   **Chemicals:** Cyanoglycosides, Thiocyanates.

#### 2. Host Factors
*   **Age:** Affects all ages, but the most vulnerable periods are fetal life, early childhood, and puberty (due to rapid growth).
*   **Sex:** Prevalence of goiter is generally higher in **females** and adolescent girls.
*   **Pregnancy:** Increases the demand for iodine; deficiency can cause irreversible fetal brain damage.

#### 3. Environmental Factors (The "Soil" Factor)
*   **Deficient Soil:** Iodine is leached away from the topsoil by heavy rains, flooding, and glaciation. Crops grown in this soil are iodine-deficient.
*   **Geography:** Classically associated with mountainous regions (Himalayas, Alps, Andes) known as the "Goiter Belt." However, it is now recognized in riverine and coastal areas as well (e.g., Kerala, Gujarat). No state in India is free from viral goiter.

### The Spectrum of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (IDD)

Iodine deficiency affects every stage of life. The term "Goiter" is the tip of the iceberg; the submerged part is the mental and physical retardation.

| Life Stage | Disorders/Consequences |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fetus** | **Abortions**, Stillbirths, Congenital anomalies, Increased perinatal mortality. <br> **Endemic Cretinism** (Neurological or Myxedematous). |
| **Neonate** | **Neonatal chemical hypothyroidism**, Neonatal goiter. |
| **Child & Adolescent** | **Goiter** (Juvenile), Impaired mental function, Retarded physical development, **Lower IQ** (approx. 13 points lower than normal). |
| **Adult** | **Goiter** and its complications, Hypothyroidism, Impaired mental function, Apathy, Reduced productivity. |

**Clinical Relevance: Types of Cretinism**
1.  **Neurological Cretinism:** Characterized by mental deficiency, deaf-mutism, squint, and spastic diplegia (stiff limbs).
2.  **Myxedematous Cretinism:** Characterized by dwarfism (short stature), severe hypothyroidism, and dry skin.

### Classification of Goiter (Assessment)

Goiter surveys are usually conducted on school children aged **6–12 years**.

*   **Grade 0:** No palpable or visible goiter.
*   **Grade 1:** Palpable but **not visible** when the neck is in a normal position (moves up with deglutition).
*   **Grade 2:** Swelling in the neck that is **visible** when the neck is in a normal position and is consistent with an enlarged thyroid on palpation.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> A flowchart showing the grading of goiter from Grade 0 to Grade 2 based on palpability and visibility is often used in practical exams.

### Prevention and Control

The cornerstone of prevention is replacing the missing nutrient.

#### 1. Iodized Salt (Universal Salt Iodization)
*   The most economical, convenient, and effective method.
*   **Fortificant:** **Potassium Iodate (KIO3)** is used in India because it is more stable in hot/humid climates than Potassium Iodide.
*   **Levels of Iodization (Under PFA Act/FSSAI):**
    *   **At Production/Manufacturer Level:** Not less than **30 ppm**.
    *   **At Consumer/Retail Level:** Not less than **15 ppm**.
    *   *Reason for difference:* To account for losses during transport and storage (iodine is volatile).

#### 2. Iodized Oil
*   Used in severe endemic areas for immediate correction.
*   **Intramuscular:** 1 ml injection provides protection for **4 years**.
*   **Oral:** Effective for **1–2 years**.

#### 3. Double Fortified Salt (DFS)
*   Fortified with both **Iron and Iodine**.
*   Developed by NIN, Hyderabad to combat both IDD and Anaemia.
*   Provides **40 mcg Iodine** and **1 mg Iron** per gram of salt.

### National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Programme (NIDDCP)

Formerly the *National Goiter Control Programme (NGCP)* launched in 1962, renamed NIDDCP in 1992.

**Objectives:**
1.  Surveys to assess the magnitude of IDD.
2.  Supply of Iodized salt in place of common salt.
3.  Resurvey every 5 years to assess impact.
4.  Laboratory monitoring of iodized salt and urinary iodine excretion.
5.  Health Education.

#### Surveillance and Indicators
To monitor progress towards the elimination of IDD, specific indicators are used:

| Indicator Type | Parameter | Goal for Elimination |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Impact Indicator** | **Urinary Iodine Excretion (UIE)** | Median UIE **> 100 mcg/L** |
| **Process Indicator** | Households consuming iodized salt | **> 90%** |
| **Clinical Indicator** | Total Goiter Rate (children 6-12 yrs) | **< 5%** |

*Note: **Urinary Iodine Excretion** is the most sensitive and principal impact indicator for recent dietary intake of iodine.*

**Salt Testing:**
*   **Spot Testing Kit:** Used by ASHAs/Health workers in the field. Ideally, salt should turn **purple/violet** when the test solution is added, indicating the presence of iodine.

### Mnemonic
**Goitrogens sources:** **C**abbage **C**auses **C**razy **T**hyroid
*   **C**abbage/Cauliflower
*   **C**assava (Tapioca)
*   **C**orn (Maize)
*   **T**hiocyanates (The chemical culprit)
