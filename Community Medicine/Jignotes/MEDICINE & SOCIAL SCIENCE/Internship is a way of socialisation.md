# [[MEDICINE & SOCIAL SCIENCE]] > Internship is a way of socialisation

### Internship as a Process of Socialization

**Socialization** is defined as the process by which an individual gradually acquires culture and becomes a member of a social group. It is the mechanism through which a biological organism is converted into a human, social, and moral being.

[[Internship]] represents a critical phase of **secondary socialization** where a medical student transitions into a professional medical practitioner.

#### Mechanism of Socialization during Internship

1.  **Acquisition of Professional Culture**
    *   Internship acts as a bridge between theoretical learning and professional practice.
    *   The intern learns the customs, beliefs, traditions, and general codes of conduct specific to the [[Medical Profession]].
    *   It involves learning the "language" of the hospital and the "unwritten rules" of the medical hierarchy.

2.  **Role Transition**
    *   The individual shifts from the **role of a student** (receiver of knowledge) to the **role of a doctor** (provider of care).
    *   They learn to handle responsibility, make decisions, and manage professional relationships.

3.  **Public Acceptability**
    *   According to Park, the [[Internship]] training programme gives doctors an opportunity to learn **how to become acceptable to the public at large**.
    *   It teaches the intern how to conduct themselves so that society accepts them as figures of authority and healing.

4.  **Learning through Interaction**
    *   **Inter-personal relationships:** Learning from seniors, consultants, and peers.
    *   **Inter-group relationships:** Learning to function as part of a healthcare team (nurses, technicians, social workers).

#### Phases of Professional Socialization

| Phase | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Observation & Imitation** | The intern observes seniors/mentors and imitates their behavior, clinical methods, and communication styles. |
| **Interaction** | Engaging with patients and the community to understand social dynamics (e.g., [[Doctor-Patient Relationship]]). |
| **Internalization** | The values and norms of the profession become part of the intern's own personality. |

#### Clinical Relevance
*   **Empathy and Communication:** Internship socializes the doctor to communicate on an **emotional plane** (sympathy), **cultural plane** (understanding community beliefs), and **intellectual plane** (bridging the knowledge gap).
*   **Social Physician:** Effective socialization during internship helps produce a "Social Physician" who treats the patient as a person, not just a case.

#### Mnemonic
To remember the goals of Internship Socialization: **PARK**
*   **P** - **P**rofessional behavior acquisition

*   **R** - **R**ole transition (Student to Doctor)
*   **K** - **K**nowledge application in a social context
