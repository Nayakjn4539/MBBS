# [[NUTRITION AND HEALTH]] > Define malnutrition. How will you assess the quality of a protein? Name the nutritional programme currently available in India. Discuss any one of them.

### 1. Definition of Malnutrition

[[Malnutrition]] is defined as a pathological state resulting from a relative or absolute deficiency or excess of one or more essential nutrients. It comprises four forms:

1.  **Undernutrition:** Resulting from insufficient food eaten over an extended period (e.g., [[Protein Energy Malnutrition]]).
2.  **Overnutrition:** Resulting from consumption of excessive quantity of food (e.g., [[Obesity]], Hypervitaminosis).
3.  **Imbalance:** Disproportion among essential nutrients.
4.  **Specific Deficiency:** Relative or absolute lack of an individual nutrient (e.g., Scurvy, Goitre).

> **Clinical Relevance:** Malnutrition makes the child more susceptible to infection, recovery is slower, and mortality is higher (Synergistic relationship between Malnutrition and Infection).

### 2. Assessment of Protein Quality

The protein content of food is not enough; its quality depends on the essential amino acid composition and digestibility. The quality is assessed by comparison to a **"Reference Protein"** (usually [[Egg protein]], which has a score of 100).

**Key Methods of Assessment:**

| Method | Description | Formula/Key Point |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Amino Acid Score** | Measures concentration of limiting amino acid in test protein vs reference protein. | $\frac{\text{mg of AA in 1g test protein}}{\text{mg of AA in 1g reference protein}} \times 100$ |
| **Net Protein Utilization ([[NPU]])** | **Best indicator.** Proportion of ingested protein retained in the body. | $\frac{\text{Nitrogen retained}}{\text{Nitrogen intake}} \times 100$ |
| **Biological Value (BV)** | Fraction of absorbed nitrogen retained for growth/maintenance. | $\frac{\text{Nitrogen retained}}{\text{Nitrogen absorbed}} \times 100$ |
| **Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER)** | Ratio of weight gain to protein consumed (used in growing animals). | $\frac{\text{Weight gain (g)}}{\text{Protein intake (g)}}$ |
| **Digestibility Coefficient** | Proportion of food nitrogen that is absorbed. | $\frac{\text{Nitrogen absorbed}}{\text{Nitrogen intake}} \times 100$ |
| **PDCAAS** | **Current Standard.** Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score. | Amino Acid Score $\times$ Protein Digestibility |

### 3. Nutritional Programmes Available in India

The Government of India has initiated several programmes to combat malnutrition:

1.  **[[Integrated Child Development Services]] (ICDS) Scheme**
2.  **Mid-day Meal Programme** (Now PM POSHAN - Pradhan Mantri Poshan Shakti Nirman)
3.  **National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Programme (NIDDCP)**
4.  **National Nutritional Anaemia Prophylaxis Programme** (Now under **Anaemia Mukt Bharat**)
5.  **Vitamin A Prophylaxis Programme** (Part of National Immunization Schedule)
6.  **Special Nutrition Programme** (SNP)
7.  **Balwadi Nutrition Programme**
8.  **Poshan Abhiyaan** (National Nutrition Mission)

### 4. Discussion: Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)

**Launched:** 2nd October 1975.
**Nodal Ministry:** Ministry of Women and Child Development.
**Heart of ICDS:** The [[Anganwadi Centre]] (AWC).

#### A. Objectives
1.  Improve the nutritional and health status of children (0–6 years).
2.  Lay the foundation for proper psychological, physical, and social development of the child.
3.  Reduce the incidence of mortality, morbidity, malnutrition, and school dropout.
4.  Achieve effective coordination of policy and implementation.
5.  Enhance the capability of the mother to look after the normal health and nutritional needs of the child.

#### B. Beneficiaries
*   Children 0–6 years.
*   Pregnant and Lactating Mothers.
*   Women in reproductive age group (15–44 years).
*   Adolescent Girls (11–18 years) - (Schemes like SAG/KSY).

#### C. Package of Services
The services are delivered in an integrated manner at the Anganwadi Centre:

| Beneficiary | Services Provided |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Children < 3 Years** | • Supplementary Nutrition<br>• Immunization<br>• Health Check-up<br>• Referral Services |
| **Children 3-6 Years** | • All of the above PLUS<br>• **Non-formal Pre-school Education** |
| **Pregnant & Lactating Mothers** | • Health Check-up<br>• Immunization (TT)<br>• Supplementary Nutrition<br>• Nutrition & Health Education |
| **Adolescent Girls** | • Nutrition & Health Education<br>• Supplementary Nutrition |

> Flowchart showing the ICDS organizational structure: Ministry -> State -> District -> Block (CDPO) -> Sector (Supervisor/Mukhya Sevika) -> Village (Anganwadi Worker)

#### D. Revised Nutritional Norms (Supplementary Nutrition)
Food is provided for **300 days** in a year.

| Category | Calories (Kcal) | Protein (g) | Cost Norm (per day) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Children (6–72 months) | 500 | 12–15 | ₹ 8.00 |
| Severely Malnourished (SAM) | 800 | 20–25 | ₹ 12.00 |
| Pregnant & Lactating Mothers | 600 | 18–20 | ₹ 9.50 |
