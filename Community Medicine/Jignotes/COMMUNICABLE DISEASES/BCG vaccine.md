# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > BCG vaccine

# [[BCG Vaccine]] (Bacille Calmette-Guerin)

**Type of Vaccine:** [[Live attenuated bacterial vaccine]].
**Source:** Derived from an attenuated strain of *[[Mycobacterium bovis]]*. The WHO recommended strain is **[[Danish 1331]]** strain.
**Production in India:** [[BCG Vaccine Laboratory]], Guindy, Chennai.

### 1. Aim and Efficacy
*   **Objective:** To induce a benign, artificial primary infection to stimulate acquired resistance.
*   **Protection:**
    *   It offers **0-80% protection** against pulmonary tuberculosis.
    *   It is highly effective in preventing **severe forms** of childhood tuberculosis, such as [[Tuberculous Meningitis]] and [[Miliary Tuberculosis]].
*   **Duration of immunity:** 15 to 20 years.

### 2. Administration Details

| Feature | Specification | Clinical Reasoning/Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dose** | **0.05 ml** (Newborn < 1 month) <br> **0.1 ml** (> 1 month old) | Newborn skin is thin; full dose may penetrate deeper causing abscess or lymphadenitis. |
| **Route** | **[[Intradermal]]** | Produces a wheal of 5mm diameter. Subcutaneous injection causes abscess. |
| **Site** | Just above the insertion of **Left Deltoid** | To maintain uniformity and help surveyors verify receipt of vaccine (Scar survey). |
| **Syringe** | **[[Tuberculin Syringe]]** | Omega microstat syringe with 26 G needle. |
| **Diluent** | **[[Normal Saline]] (NaCl)** | **Never use Distilled Water** (causes severe irritation). |

### 3. The "BCG Reaction" Timeline
(Important for counselling parents)

1.  **2–3 Weeks:** A **papule** develops at the site.
2.  **5 Weeks:** Increases to 4–8 mm in diameter.
3.  **Breakdown:** Breaks into a shallow ulcer (often covered with a crust).
4.  **6–12 Weeks:** Heals spontaneously leaving a permanent **[[Tiny Round Scar]]** (4–8 mm).
5.  **8–14 Weeks:** [[Mantoux test]] becomes positive.

> **Clinical Relevance:** If no scar appears, there is **no need to re-vaccinate** the child.

### 4. Storage and Cold Chain
*   **Form:** Freeze-dried ([[Lyophilized]]) powder.
*   **Temperature:** Store at **+2°C to +8°C**.
*   **Light Sensitivity:** Highly sensitive to sunlight (store in dark/amber vials).
*   **Reconstitution Rule:** Once reconstituted with Normal Saline, it must be used within **3 to 4 hours** (Maximum 6 hours by some guidelines, but strictly discard after session).
*   **Open Vial Policy:** Not applicable. Discard remaining vaccine after the session.

### 5. Contraindications
*   **Absolute:**
    *   Congenital immunodeficiency.
    *   Symptomatic [[HIV infection]] or AIDS.
    *   Patients on immunosuppressive therapy (steroids, radiation).
*   **Temporary:**
    *   Generalized eczema or infective dermatosis (inject in healthy skin).
    *   Prematurity is **NOT** a contraindication, but dose is reduced to 0.05 ml.

### 6. Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI)
*   **Common/Minor:** Local pain, swelling, redness.
*   **Specific/Severe:**
    *   Prolonged severe ulceration.
    *   **[[Suppurative Lymphadenitis]]** (Axillary).
    *   [[Osteomyelitis]] (Rare).
    *   Disseminated BCG infection (Fatal, occurs in immunodeficient).
    *   Keloid formation.

### 7. HIV and BCG Policy
*   **Asymptomatic HIV infants:** Give BCG in high TB burden areas.
*   **Symptomatic HIV infants:** Do **NOT** give BCG (Risk of disseminated disease > benefit).
