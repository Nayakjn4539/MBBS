# [[ENVIRONMENT & HEALTH]] > Hazards of noise pollution

### Definition
Noise is often defined as "unwanted sound". A better definition for community health purposes is **"wrong sound, in the wrong place, at the wrong time"**. It has become a significant [[stress factor]] in the modern environment.

### Effects of Noise Exposure
The hazards of noise pollution are broadly classified into two categories: **Auditory** and **Non-auditory** effects.

#### 1. Auditory Effects
These effects are directly related to the pathology of the hearing mechanism.

*   **Auditory Fatigue:**
    *   Appears in the **90 dB** region and is greatest at **4000 Hz**.
    *   Associated with side effects like **whistling and buzzing** in the ears (tinnitus).
*   **Deafness (Hearing Loss):**
    *   **Temporary Threshold Shift (TTS):** Results from specific exposure to noise. The disability disappears after a period of up to **24 hours** following exposure. Most temporary hearing loss occurs in the frequency range of **4000–6000 Hz**.
    *   **Permanent Threshold Shift (PTS):** Repeated or continuous exposure to noise around **100 dB** may result in permanent hearing loss.
    *   **Pathology:** Damage varies from minor changes in hair cell endings to complete destruction of the [[Organ of Corti]].
    *   **Occupational Hearing Loss:** When this occurs due to industry occupation.
    *   **Tympanic Membrane Rupture:** Exposure to noise above **160 dB** may cause rupture of the tympanic membrane and permanent mechanical damage.

> **Clinical Relevance:**
> In [[Noise Induced Hearing Loss]] (NIHL), the audiogram typically shows a characteristic **dip or notch at the 4000 Hz** frequency. This is often an early diagnostic sign before the patient is subjectively aware of deafness.

#### 2. Non-Auditory Effects
These constitute the majority of problems arising from community noise.

*   **Interference with Speech:**
    *   Noise interferes with communication. Frequencies between **300–500 Hz** cause the most disturbance.
*   **Annoyance:**
    *   This is primarily a psychological response.
    *   Manifests as irritability, short temper, and impatience. Neurotic individuals are more sensitive to noise.
*   **Efficiency:**
    *   Noise affects mental concentration. Reduction in noise has been shown to increase work output.
*   **Physiological Changes:**
    *   **Cardiovascular:** Rise in blood pressure ([[Hypertension]]), increase in heart rate.
    *   **CNS:** Rise in intracranial pressure (ICP).
    *   **Others:** Increase in sweating, breathing rate, giddiness, nausea, and fatigue.
    *   **Visual:** Dilatation of pupils, affected color perception, and reduced night vision.
*   **Sleep Disturbance:** Noise interferes with restorative sleep.

### Acceptable Noise Levels (dB A)

| Area/Location | Acceptable Noise Level (dB A) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Residential (Bedroom)** | 25 |
| **Residential (Living room)** | 40 |
| **Educational (Classroom)** | 30–40 |
| **Hospitals (Wards)** | 20–35 |
| **Industrial (Workshop)** | 40–60 |
| **Commercial (Office)** | 35–45 |

### Mnemonic
To remember the **Non-Auditory Effects** of Noise: **SPEED**
*   **S** - **S**peech interference
*   **P** - **P**hysiological changes (BP, HR, Sweating)
*   **E** - **E**fficiency decreased
*   **E** - **E**motional annoyance
*   **D** - **D**isturbance of sleep/visual
