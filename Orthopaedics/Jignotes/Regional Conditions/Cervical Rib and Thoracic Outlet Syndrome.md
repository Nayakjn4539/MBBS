# [[Regional Conditions]] > Cervical Rib and Thoracic Outlet Syndrome

# Cervical Rib and Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS)

### Introduction and Definitions

**[[Cervical Rib]]**: A supernumerary (extra) rib arising from the 7th cervical vertebra (C7), and rarely from C6 or C5. It is a congenital anomaly where the costal element of the 7th cervical vertebra develops into a rib instead of a transverse process.
*   **Incidence**: Approximately 0.46%. Nearly 50% of cases are bilateral.
*   **Morphology**: It may range from a small bony nodule to a fully formed rib articulating with the first thoracic rib or sternum. Often, it is connected to the first rib by a fibrous band, which is equally capable of causing compression.

**[[Thoracic Outlet Syndrome]] (TOS)**: A clinical syndrome caused by the compression of the [[neurovascular bundle]] (comprising the [[brachial plexus]], [[subclavian artery]], and [[subclavian vein]]) as they exit the chest through the thoracic outlet (cervicothoracic junction).

**Clinical Implication:** A cervical rib is akin to the "Return of the Prodigal Son"; however, unlike the biblical son, the cervical rib returns to torment the victim. It is important to note that many people with cervical ribs are asymptomatic; the rib is often an incidental finding on X-rays.

### Anatomy and Sites of Compression

The neurovascular structures pass through three potential spaces where compression can occur:

1.  **Supraclavicular Space ([[Interscalene Triangle]]):**
    *   Bounded by the [[anterior scalene]] muscle, the middle scalene muscle, and the first rib.
    *   The brachial plexus and subclavian artery pass through here.
    *   *Pathology:* Hypertrophy of muscles or a cervical rib narrows this space.
2.  **Subclavicular Space (Costoclavicular Space):**
    *   Bounded by the clavicle, the first thoracic rib, and the subclavius muscle.
    *   *Pathology:* Depression of the shoulder girdle narrows this space.
3.  **Infraclavicular Space:**
    *   Beneath the enclosure formed by the coracoid process, [[pectoralis minor]], and costocoracoid membrane.
    *   *Pathology:* Tightness of the pectoralis minor (Hyperabduction syndrome).

### Etiology and Pathomechanics

The compression is usually a combination of static anatomical factors and dynamic functional factors.

*   **Static Factors (Anatomical Anomalies):**
    *   Presence of a [[cervical rib]] (bony or fibrous band).
    *   Elongated C7 transverse process.
    *   Anomalous insertions of scalene muscles (Scalenus anticus syndrome).
    *   Malunited fracture of the clavicle.
    *   Exostosis of the first rib.
*   **Dynamic Factors (Postural/Functional):**
    *   **Sagging Shoulder Girdle:** In middle age, the shoulder muscles lose tone and the shoulder girdle droops. This lowers the clavicle and compresses the neurovascular bundle against the cervical rib or the first rib.
    *   Poor posture (slouching).
    *   Professions requiring overhead arm activities (e.g., painters, mechanics).

### Clinical Features

Symptoms usually appear in adolescents or young adults, more commonly in females. The clinical presentation depends on whether the nerves or vessels are predominantly compressed.

#### 1. Neurological Symptoms (Most Common)
Compression of the lower trunk of the [[brachial plexus]] (C8 and T1 nerve roots).
*   **Pain:** Aching pain in the neck, shoulder, and arm, often radiating to the medial aspect of the forearm and hand (T1 distribution).
*   **Paresthesia:** "Pins and needles" sensation, numbness, or tingling in the little and ring fingers (C8 dermatome).
*   **Motor Weakness:**
    *   Weakness and wasting of the small muscles of the hand (interossei, hypothenar muscles, adductor pollicis).
    *   Difficulty with fine motor tasks (e.g., buttoning shirts, gripping objects).
*   **Sensory Loss:** Hypoesthesia along the ulnar border of the forearm and hand.

#### 2. Vascular Symptoms
Compression of the [[subclavian artery]] (and rarely the vein).
*   **Ischaemia:** Pallor, coldness, and claudication pain in the arm and hand, especially when working with the arm elevated.
*   **[[Raynaud's Phenomenon]]:** Intermittent attacks of finger blanching and cyanosis upon exposure to cold.
*   **Pulse Changes:** The radial pulse may be diminished or absent, particularly with specific arm maneuvers.
*   **Complications:**
    *   **Post-stenotic dilatation (Aneurysm):** Turbulence distal to the constriction causes the artery to dilate.
    *   **Embolism:** Thrombus forming in the aneurysm may embolize distally, causing gangrene of the fingertips.
    *   **Venous Compression:** Rare, but can cause edema and cyanosis of the limb.

### Clinical Examination and Special Tests

A thorough examination is required to differentiate TOS from other causes of upper limb pain.

#### 1. Inspection
*   Look for a bony lump in the supraclavicular fossa (palpable cervical rib).
*   Look for wasting of the thenar (sometimes) and hypothenar eminences (guttering of the hand).
*   Observe color changes (pallor/cyanosis) in the hand.

#### 2. Provocative Tests
These tests aim to reproduce symptoms or obliterate the radial pulse by narrowing the thoracic outlet. **Note:** A dampened pulse can occur in normal individuals; reproduction of *symptoms* is more diagnostic.

| Test Name | Maneuver | Positive Finding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Adson's Test]]** | Patient sitting. The examiner palpates the radial pulse. Patient takes a deep breath, holds it, and turns the head **towards** the affected side while extending the neck. | Disappearance or diminution of the radial pulse. |
| **[[Wright's Test]]** (Hyperabduction) | The arm is hyperabducted and externally rotated. | Disappearance of pulse or reproduction of symptoms. |
| **[[Roos Test]]** (EAST) | **E**levated **A**rm **S**tress **T**est. Patient abducts arms to 90°, flexes elbows to 90° ("surrender" position), and opens/closes fists slowly for 3 minutes. | Inability to continue for 3 minutes due to pain, heaviness, or paresthesia. Considered the most reliable test. |

**Mnemonic for Head Position in Adson's Test:**
*   **Ad**son's = **Add** (look **T**owards the **A**ffected side).

### Investigations

1.  **X-ray Cervical Spine (AP and Lateral):**
    *   To visualize the osseous [[cervical rib]] extending from C7.
    *   To look for an elongated C7 transverse process.
2.  **[[Chest X-ray]] (PA view):**
    *   To exclude apical lung tumors ([[Pancoast's tumor]]).
3.  **MRI / CT Scan:**
    *   To visualize fibrous bands (which are radiolucent on plain X-ray) and soft tissue anatomy.
    *   To rule out cervical disc prolapse or spinal cord tumors.
4.  **Electrodiagnostic Studies (EMG/NCV):**
    *   To differentiate from carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome (ulnar nerve at elbow), and cervical radiculopathy.
    *   In TOS, NCV may show conduction block across the plexus, but often findings are subtle.
5.  **Doppler Ultrasound / Angiography:**
    *   Indicated if vascular compromise (aneurysm, thrombus) is suspected.

### Differential Diagnosis

*   **[[Cervical Spondylosis]]:** Osteophytes compressing nerve roots (usually C5/C6/C7). Pain increases with neck movement; Spurling's test positive.
*   **[[Carpal Tunnel Syndrome]]:** Compression of median nerve at wrist. Phalen's test positive; nocturnal symptoms prominent.
*   **[[Ulnar Nerve Entrapment]] (Cubital Tunnel):** Compression at the elbow. Tinel's sign at the elbow positive.
*   **[[Pancoast Tumor]]:** Apical lung cancer invading the brachial plexus. Often presents with severe pain, Horner's syndrome, and a mass on chest X-ray.
*   **[[Rotator Cuff]] Lesions:** Shoulder pathology causing referred pain.

### Treatment

Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms and the presence of complications.

#### 1. Conservative Management (First Line)
Most patients respond to non-operative measures, especially if symptoms are mild or intermittent.
*   **Physiotherapy:**
    *   **Strengthening:** Focus on the shoulder girdle elevators (Trapezius, Levator Scapulae) to correct the "drooping shoulder".
    *   **Postural exercises:** Correction of slouching and forward head posture.
    *   **Stretching:** Pectoralis minor and scalene muscles.
*   **Analgesics:** NSAIDs for pain relief.
*   **Activity Modification:** Avoiding heavy lifting and overhead activities.

#### 2. Surgical Management
**Indications:**
*   Failure of conservative treatment.
*   Severe or progressive neurological deficit (muscle wasting).
*   Vascular complications (ischemia, aneurysm, emboli).
*   Intractable pain interfering with daily life.

**Procedures:**
*   **Excision of Cervical Rib:** If a bony rib is present, it is removed along with any fibrous bands.
*   **Scalenotomy:** Division of the scalenus anterior muscle to relieve compression.
*   **First Rib Resection:** Removal of the first thoracic rib is often considered the most effective procedure as it decompresses both the supraclavicular and infraclavicular spaces.
*   **Approaches:**
    *   Supraclavicular approach (standard for cervical rib).
    *   Transaxillary approach (often used for first rib resection).
