# [[DISASTER MANAGEMENT]] > Define disaster. What are the common disasters faced by people of India? Name one natural and one manmade disaster in recent past. As a BMOH of a BPHC near a coastal area what preparedness would you have to manage disaster?

### Definition of Disaster

A [[Disaster]] is defined as a serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society involving widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses and impacts, which **exceed the ability of the affected community or society to cope** using its own resources.

**Operational Definition (WHO):** Any occurrence that causes damage, ecological disruption, loss of human life, or deterioration of health and health services on a scale sufficient to warrant an extraordinary response from outside the affected community or area.

**Colin Grant Definition:** A catastrophe causing injury or illness simultaneously to at least 30 people who will require hospital emergency treatment.

### Common Disasters Faced by People of India

India is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the Asia-Pacific region due to its physiographic and climatic conditions.

| Type of Disaster | Region/Frequency |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Floods** | Common in Eastern coastal areas (Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Orissa), Bihar, Assam, and UP. Affects ~30 million people annually. |
| **Droughts** | Western desert areas; approx. 16% of the country is drought-prone. |
| **Cyclones** | Coastal areas; East coast is more vulnerable than the west coast. |
| **Earthquakes** | Northern mountain regions (Himalayas) and foothills; approx. 50-60% of India is vulnerable. |
| **Epidemics** | Outbreaks of water-borne and vector-borne diseases. |
| **Accidents** | Railways, mines, and factories. |

### Recent Disasters in India (Examples from Sources)

**1. Natural Disaster:**
*   **Uttarakhand Floods (June 2013):** Cloudburst causing floods killed about 5,748 people.
*   *Alternative:* Indian Ocean **Tsunami (2004)** or **Orissa Super Cyclone (1999)**.

**2. Manmade Disaster:**
*   **Bhopal Gas Tragedy (1984):** Leakage of methyl isocyanate gas from Union Carbide Plant; world's worst industrial disaster.
*   *Alternative:* **Mumbai Terror Attacks (2008)** or **Uphaar Cinema Fire (1997)**.

### Preparedness Plan for a BMOH (Block Medical Officer of Health) in a Coastal Area

As a BMOH of a [[Block Primary Health Centre]] (BPHC) near a coastal area, the primary risks are **Cyclones, Floods, and Tsunamis**. The preparedness plan must focus on the "Disaster Cycle" phase before the impact.

**Mnemonic for BMOH Preparedness: "COASTAL"**

#### 1. **C** - Coordination and Communication
*   **Control Room:** Establish a 24-hour control room at the BPHC with reliable communication lines (wireless, satellite phones) as normal networks may fail.
*   **Inter-sectoral Meetings:** Coordinate with the Block Development Officer (BDO), police, and local Panchayat for evacuation plans and rescue operations.
*   **Warning System:** Ensure the mechanism to receive and disseminate cyclone warnings from the meteorological department to the community.

#### 2. **O** - Organization of Medical Team (Rapid Response Team)
*   Form a **Rapid Response Team (RRT)** consisting of doctors, paramedics, and multipurpose workers.
*   **Training:** Train staff in **[[Triage]]** (color-coding victims based on priority: Red, Yellow, Green, Black) and First Aid.
*   **Vaccination:** Vaccinate health workers against Tetanus and Hepatitis B as they are first responders.

#### 3. **A** - Awareness and Education (IEC)
*   Educate the community on **Do’s and Don’ts** for cyclones and floods.
*   **Hygiene:** Promote boiling water, hand washing, and food hygiene to prevent gastroenteritis.
*   **Drowning Prevention:** Educate on safety measures to prevent drowning, which is a major risk in coastal disasters.

#### 4. **S** - Stockpiling of Essentials (Logistics)
*   **Drugs:** Ensure 3 months buffer stock of essential medicines:
    *   **ORS** and IV fluids (Ringer Lactate/Normal Saline) for [[Gastroenteritis]] and Cholera.
    *   Antibiotics (Doxycycline for Leptospirosis prophylaxis, Ciprofloxacin).
    *   **Anti-Snake Venom (ASV):** Snakebites increase during floods due to water entering burrows.
    *   Halogen tablets/Bleaching powder for water disinfection.
*   **Vaccines:** Ensure stock of Anti-Tetanus and Anti-Rabies vaccines. Note: Mass typhoid/cholera vaccination is **not** recommended immediately.
*   **Equipment:** splints, dressing material, oxygen cylinders, and generators for power backup.

#### 5. **T** - Transport and Infrastructure Protection
*   **Ambulance:** Ensure the BPHC ambulance is fueled and functional.
*   **Structure Safety:** Secure the BPHC building (taping windows, securing loose tiles) against high winds.
*   **Safe Zone:** Identify a high-lying area or cyclone shelter to shift bedridden patients if the BPHC is threatened by inundation.

#### 6. **A** - Anti-Epidemic Measures (Surveillance)
*   **Water Quality:** Plan for massive [[Chlorination]] of wells and water sources immediately post-disaster. Residual chlorine level should be maintained at **> 0.7 mg/L**.
*   **Vector Control:** Stockpile insecticides (DDT/Malathion) as vector-borne diseases like Malaria and Dengue rise after water stagnation.
*   **Surveillance:** Activate the [[Integrated Disease Surveillance Project]] (IDSP) to detect early warning signs of outbreaks (e.g., clustering of fever or diarrhea cases).

#### 7. **L** - Lab and Records
*   Ensure the lab is equipped to test for common epidemic-prone diseases (Cholera, Malaria, Leptospirosis).
*   Protect medical records and registers from water damage (keep in upper shelves/waterproof bags).

**Clinical Relevance:**
In coastal disasters, the most commonly reported disease in the post-disaster phase is **Gastroenteritis**. The most practical strategy is supplying safe drinking water. Additionally, watch out for **Leptospirosis** (due to contact with rodent-urine contaminated flood water) and **Measles** in crowded relief camps (ensure Vitamin A supplementation).
