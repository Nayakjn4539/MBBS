# Tarsorrhaphy

[[Tarsorrhaphy]] is a surgical procedure in which adhesions are created between a part of the upper and lower eyelid margins with the aim to narrow down or almost close the [[palpebral aperture]]. This procedure is vital for protecting the ocular surface when the eyelids cannot close properly or when the cornea requires protection to heal.

## Types and Indications

Tarsorrhaphy is broadly classified into two types based on the duration and intent of the closure:

| Type | Definition | Indications |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Temporary Tarsorrhaphy** | Creates temporary adhesions, usually central or paramedian, that can be separated later. | • Protection of cornea in [[facial nerve palsy]] (when recovery is expected).<br>• To assist healing of an indolent [[corneal ulcer]].<br>• To assist in healing of skin grafts of the lids in correct position. |
| **Permanent Tarsorrhaphy** | Creates permanent adhesions, usually at the lateral canthus. | • Established [[facial nerve palsy]] with no chance of recovery.<br>• Established [[neurotrophic keratopathy]] (neuroparalytic keratitis) with severe loss of corneal sensation.<br>• Severe [[dry eye]] cases not responding to conservative therapy. |

## Surgical Instruments Required

The following instruments are essential for performing a tarsorrhaphy, facilitating incision, tissue handling, and suturing:

*   **[[Scalpel Handle]] (Bard-Parker Handle):** Used to hold the surgical blade (typically No. 11 or 15) to make the incision along the lid margin. It is light and affords a firm grip.
*   **[[Plain Dissecting Forceps]]:** A simple forcep without teeth. It is used to hold the skin during eyelid surgery and to tie sutures.
*   **[[Needle Holder]] (e.g., Castroviejo or Arruga's):** Used to grasp and pass the needle through the tough tarsal plate and skin. The Castroviejo needle holder is commonly used in extraocular and lid surgery.
*   **Suture Tier Forceps:** Specialized forceps used to grasp the suture material for tying knots securely. Often, plain forceps or Kelman-McPherson forceps serve this function in ophthalmic sets.

## Surgical Techniques

### 1. Temporary Tarsorrhaphy (Median or Paramedian)

This technique creates a temporary adhesion while leaving the corners open for observation and medication instillation.

1.  **Anesthesia:** Local infiltration anesthesia is administered.
2.  **Marking:** About 5 mm long incision site is marked on the corresponding parts of the upper and lower lid margins, typically 3 mm on either side of the midline.
3.  **Incision:** Using the [[scalpel handle]] and blade, an incision approximately **2 mm deep** is made in the [[grey line]] on the marked site.
4.  **Excision:** The marginal epithelium is excised carefully. It is crucial not to damage the ciliary line (eyelashes) anteriorly or the sharp posterior lid border.
5.  **Suturing:** The raw surfaces created on the opposing lid margins are sutured together. Double-armed **6-0 silk sutures** are passed through the raw areas and anchored through a rubber bolster (tubing) to prevent skin maceration and ensure tight apposition.

### 2. Permanent Tarsorrhaphy (Lateral)

This procedure is performed at the lateral canthus to permanently narrow the palpebral fissure.

1.  **Preparation:** The eyelids are overlapped to estimate the amount of closure required.
2.  **Excision of Flaps:**
    *   A **triangular flap of skin and orbicularis muscle** is excised from the *lower lid*.
    *   A corresponding **triangular tarsoconjunctival flap** is excised from the *upper lid*.
3.  **Suturing:** The raw surfaces are brought together, and the flaps are overlapped and sutured permanently to create a strong adhesion.

### Clinical Implications

*   **Corneal Protection:** The primary goal is to prevent [[exposure keratopathy]] and [[corneal ulceration]] in cases of [[lagophthalmos]] (inability to close eyes).
*   **Neurotrophic Ulcers:** In [[neuroparalytic keratitis]] (e.g., after trigeminal nerve damage), the cornea loses sensation and trophic support. Tarsorrhaphy drastically reduces evaporation and protects the epithelium, often arresting the ulcerative process.
*   **Leprosy:** In lepromatous leprosy involving the facial nerve, tarsorrhaphy is a sight-saving procedure to prevent exposure keratitis from lagophthalmos.

### Mnemonic for Indications
**LEND** a hand to close the eye:
*   **L**agophthalmos (Facial palsy)
*   **E**xposure Keratopathy
*   **N**eurotrophic Keratopathy
*   **D**ry Eye (Severe)
