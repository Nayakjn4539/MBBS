# [[PRINCIPLES OF EPIDEMIOLOGY]] > A 7days old baby is brought to your OPD with excessive cry, refusal of feed & convulsions. Discuss diagnosis, case management & preventive studies as per national immunization program?

### **Diagnosis**

Based on the clinical presentation of a **7-day-old** baby with **excessive cry**, **refusal of feed** (inability to suck), and **convulsions** (spasms), the most probable diagnosis is **[[Neonatal Tetanus]]** (Tetanus Neonatorum).

*   **Clinical Reasoning:**
    *   **"8th Day Disease":** Neonatal tetanus typically manifests around the 7th day of life (incubation period 3–14 days), hence it is colloquially known as the "8th day disease".
    *   **Refusal of Feed:** This is often the **first symptom**. The baby, who previously sucked normally for the first 2 days, loses the ability to suck due to trismus (lockjaw) and rigidity of facial muscles.
    *   **Excessive Cry:** irritability and persistent crying often precede the onset of generalized rigidity.
    *   **Convulsions:** These are actually **tetanic spasms** triggered by stimuli (touch, light, noise), characterized by generalized rigidity, clenched fists, and arching of the back (opisthotonos).

*   **Standard Case Definition (NNEP):**
    *   **Suspect Case:** Any neonatal death between 3 and 28 days of age where the cause is unknown, or any neonate reported as having tetanus.
    *   **Probable Case:** Any neonate with **normal ability to suck and cry during the first 2 days of life** who, between 3 and 28 days of age, **cannot suck normally** and becomes **stiff or has spasms**.

*   **Differential Diagnosis:**
    *   **[[AEFI]] (Adverse Event Following Immunization):** Encephalopathy or seizures can occur following vaccination, but typical onset for DTP/Measles seizures is later. However, if the child received birth doses (Hep B), rare anaphylaxis or coincidental seizures could be considered.
    *   **Neonatal Sepsis/Meningitis:** Present with refusal to feed and convulsions but typically associated with fever, bulging fontanelle, and lethargy rather than rigidity.
    *   **Metabolic Disorders:** Hypoglycemia or hypocalcemia presenting with jitteriness/seizures.

### **Case Management**

Management requires immediate hospitalization in a specialized unit. The principles are to neutralize the toxin, prevent spasms, and provide supportive care.

#### **1. General Measures**
*   **[[Isolation]]:** Place the baby in a **quiet, darkened room** to minimize external stimuli (noise, light, touch) that precipitate spasms/convulsions.
*   **Supportive Care:**
    *   **Hydration & Nutrition:** Intravenous fluids initially; nasogastric feeding may be required as the baby cannot suck.
    *   **Airway:** Ensure a patent airway; suction secretions gently.

#### **2. Specific Treatment**
*   **Neutralize Unbound Toxin:**
    *   **Human Tetanus Immunoglobulin ([[TIG]]):** 250–500 IU (IM). This is the preferred agent.
    *   **Equine Antitoxin (ATS):** 750 IU or 1500–3000 IU if TIG is unavailable (Test dose required for hypersensitivity).
*   **Control Spasms (Sedation):**
    *   **Sedatives:** [[Diazepam]], Phenobarbital, or Chlorpromazine are used to control rigidity and convulsions.
    *   **Muscle Relaxants:** In severe cases, drugs with curare-like action may be needed.
*   **Eradicate Bacteria:**
    *   **Antibiotics:** **[[Penicillin G]]** (100,000 units/kg/day) or **Erythromycin** to kill vegetative *Clostridium tetani* and halt toxin production.
    *   **Wound Care:** The umbilical stump (common portal of entry) should be cleaned and treated with antiseptics.

#### **3. Immunization**
*   **Active Vaccination:** Recovery from tetanus **does not** confer natural immunity. The baby must start the primary immunization schedule (Pentavalent/DPT) as per the National Immunization Schedule.

### **Preventive Studies & Strategies (National Immunization Program)**

Prevention focuses on maternal immunity and safe delivery practices under the **Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus Elimination (MNTE)** initiative.

#### **1. Maternal Immunization (Antenatal Care)**
*   **Vaccine:** **[[Td Vaccine]]** (Tetanus and adult Diphtheria toxoid) is now used instead of TT.
*   **Schedule:**
    *   **Primigravida:** 2 doses of Td, 4 weeks apart. The first dose should be given as early as possible in pregnancy (preferably 1st trimester).
    *   **Previously Immunized (within 3 years):** 1 Booster dose of Td.
*   **Objective:** To ensure protective antibody levels (IgG) cross the placenta to protect the neonate.

#### **2. Clean Delivery Practices (The "Cleans")**
To prevent contamination of the umbilical cord during childbirth.
*   **The 5 Cleans:** [[Mnemonic: 5 Cs]]
    1.  Clean **H**ands (of the attendant).
    2.  Clean **S**urface (for delivery).
    3.  Clean **B**lade (for cutting cord).
    4.  Clean **C**ord Tie.
    5.  Clean **C**ord Stump (No application of cow dung/ash).
*   *Note: "7 Cleans" adds Clean Water and Clean Towel.*

#### **3. Promotion of Institutional Delivery**
*   Schemes like **[[Janani Suraksha Yojana]] (JSY)** and **Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK)** incentivize institutional deliveries where sterile practices are maintained.

#### **4. Surveillance**
*   **Active Surveillance:** Reporting of any neonatal death or case of "unable to suck" as a suspected case of Neonatal Tetanus.
*   **Goal:** Elimination defined as **<1 case per 1000 live births** in every district.
