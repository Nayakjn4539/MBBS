# [[Irritant Poisons (Animal)]] > Scorpions and Cantharides

# Scorpions

[[Scorpions]] are eight-legged arthropods belonging to the class Arachnida. While there are numerous species, only a few are dangerously poisonous to humans. In India, the most medically important species are **_Mesobuthus tamulus_** (Indian Red Scorpion - most lethal) and **_Palamnaeus gravimanus_** (Black Scorpion - less lethal, causes severe pain).

### Venom Characteristics
*   **Nature:** Clear, colorless, proteinous [[toxalbumin]].
*   **Composition:** Contains phospholipase, acetylcholinesterase, hyaluronidase, histamine, and serotonin.
*   **Types:**
    1.  **Neurotoxic:** Acts on the peripheral and autonomic nervous system (e.g., Red Scorpion).
    2.  **Hemotoxic:** Causes hemolysis and hemorrhage.
    3.  **Cardiotoxic:** Direct effect on the myocardium.
*   **Mechanism:** The venom is a potent **autonomic stimulator**. It stimulates sodium channels, keeping them open, leading to massive release of [[catecholamines]] (autonomic storm).

### Clinical Features
The clinical presentation depends on the species. **Pain** is the main clinical feature.

#### 1. Local Symptoms
*   Severe, excruciating, radiating pain at the sting site.
*   Redness and local swelling.
*   **Tap Test:** Severe pain/hyperesthesia is accentuated by tapping on the affected area.
*   Profuse sweating at the bite site.

#### 2. Systemic Symptoms (Autonomic Storm)
The venom causes a massive release of neurotransmitters, leading to a biphasic response:

**A. Cholinergic Phase (Parasympathetic stimulation) - Early:**
*   Vomiting, profuse sweating, salivation.
*   [[Bradycardia]], hypotension.
*   [[Priapism]] (painful penile erection) in males.
*   Dilated pupils.

**B. Adrenergic Phase (Sympathetic stimulation) - Late:**
*   [[Hypertension]] (severe).
*   [[Tachycardia]].
*   **Acute [[Pulmonary Edema]]:** Cold clammy skin, cyanosis, tachycardia, tachypnea. This is a common cause of death.
*   Myocardial damage/myocarditis.
*   Peripheral circulatory failure (Shock).

**Mnemonic for Autonomic Storm: "SLUDGE"** (Cholinergic effects)
*   **S**alivation
*   **L**acrimation
*   **U**rination
*   **D**efecation
*   **G**astrointestinal distress
*   **E**mesis

### Diagnosis
*   History of sting.
*   Positive **Tap Test**.
*   ECG changes: T-wave inversion, ST-segment elevation (mimics [[Myocardial Infarction]]).
*   Elevated cardiac markers (CPK-MB, Troponin).

### Management
**1. Local Treatment:**
*   **Tourniquet:** Application proximal to the sting (controversial but often cited in older texts).
*   **Lignocaine block:** Local infiltration of [[Lignocaine]] (Xylocaine) to relieve pain.
*   **Cryotherapy:** Ice packs to reduce pain and enzyme activity.

**2. Specific Management:**
*   **[[Prazosin]]:** It is the **physiological antidote** and drug of choice. It is an alpha-blocker that counteracts the sympathetic storm (hypertension and pulmonary edema). Dose: 30 mcg/kg per dose.
*   **Anti-Scorpion Venom (ASV):** Lyophilized monovalent venom is specific but availability is often limited.

**3. Supportive Care:**
*   **Calcium Gluconate:** 10 ml of 10% solution slow IV for muscle cramps.
*   **Insulin-Glucose infusion:** To support the myocardium.
*   **Sedation:** Barbiturates for convulsions.
*   **Avoid Morphine:** It synergizes with venom to depress respiration.

### Medicolegal Aspects
*   Mostly **accidental** (farmers, villagers, children playing).
*   Homicide and suicide are extremely rare.
*   **[[Autopsy Findings]]:** Not specific. Bite mark may be visible. Congestion of internal organs. Pulmonary edema and myocardial necrosis are key internal findings.

# Cantharides (Spanish Fly)

[[Cantharides]], also known as **Spanish Fly** or Blister Beetle (*Cantharis vesicatoria*), is an emerald-green or blue-green beetle. The dried, powdered beetles are used as poison.

### Active Principle
*   **[[Cantharidin]]:** The active toxin found in the body fluids and hemolymph of the beetle.
*   It is a potent irritant that causes vesication (blistering) on contact.
*   It is stable and does not decompose easily.

### Fatal Dose and Period
*   **Fatal Dose:** 15 to 50 mg of cantharidin OR 1.5 to 3 grams of powdered beetles.
*   **Fatal Period:** 24 to 36 hours.

### Clinical Features
Cantharidin is absorbed from all surfaces (skin, mucous membranes).

**1. Local Contact:**
*   Intense irritation, redness, and burning pain.
*   Formation of large [[vesicles]] or blisters.

**2. On Ingestion (Gastrointestinal Tract):**
*   Acrid, burning taste in mouth and throat.
*   Difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia).
*   Severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting (vomitus may contain blood).
*   **Bloody diarrhea** with tenesmus.

**3. Genitourinary System (Specific Target):**
*   The toxin is excreted by kidneys, causing severe inflammation.
*   Dull pain in loins (nephritis).
*   **Strangury:** Frequent, painful urge to urinate with little output.
*   **[[Hematuria]]:** Blood in urine.
*   **[[Priapism]]:** Persistent, painful erection of the penis (in males). **This is a characteristic feature**.
*   In females, it may cause uterine bleeding or abortion.

**4. Nervous System:**
*   Giddiness, convulsions, coma, and collapse leading to death.

### Treatment
1.  **Stomach Wash:** With warm water.
2.  **Demulcents:** Use egg whites or mucilage to soothe the mucosa.
3.  **Avoid Fats/Oils:** Oils increase the solubility and absorption of cantharidin, worsening toxicity.
4.  **Symptomatic:** IV fluids for shock, anesthetics for pain, maintenance of electrolyte balance.

### Autopsy Findings
*   **GI Tract:** Mucosa is congested, inflamed, and may show patches of ulceration or blistering. Powdered particles (shining green specks) may be seen.
*   **Kidneys and Bladder:** Acutely inflamed. The renal pelvis and bladder mucosa show intense congestion and hemorrhage.

### Medicolegal Aspects
1.  **Aphrodisiac:** Historically used as a "love potion" to stimulate sexual desire due to its ability to cause pelvic congestion and priapism. This practice is dangerous and often leads to fatal poisoning.
2.  **Abortifacient:** Used to induce abortion (criminal abortion) due to its irritant action on the genitourinary tract.
3.  **Accidental Poisoning:** May occur in children or animals.
4.  **Cattle Poison:** Sometimes used to poison livestock.
5.  **Homicidal:** Rare, sometimes used in powder form (may resemble powdered glass).
