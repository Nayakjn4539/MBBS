# [[Recent Advances And Therapeutics]] > Artificial Retina and Bionic Eye

### Artificial Retina and Bionic Eye (Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System)

**Overview**
The [[Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System]], commonly referred to as the **Bionic Eye** or [[Retinal Implant]], is a recent therapeutic advancement intended to provide electrical stimulation of the [[Retina]] to induce visual perception in blind individuals. It is primarily indicated for patients with severe to profound [[Retinitis Pigmentosa]] (RP).

**Mechanism of Action**
The system bypasses the damaged [[Photoreceptors]] (rods and cones) and directly stimulates the remaining viable cells of the retina (such as [[Ganglion Cells]] or [[Bipolar Cells]]) to transmit visual signals to the brain.

**System Components**
The device consists of external and internal (implanted) components:

| Component | Location | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Digital Camera** | Mounted on eyeglass frames | Captures images of the user's surroundings. |
| **Video Processing Unit (VPU)** | Worn on a belt/strap | Processes signals from the camera and transmits them wirelessly to the implant. |
| **Retinal Implant** | Surgically placed on the retinal surface | Contains **60 electrodes** (each 200 microns in diameter) that emit electrical pulses to stimulate the retina. |

**Patient Selection Criteria (Prerequisites)**
The implant is currently approved for patients meeting specific inclusion criteria:
1.  **Diagnosis:** Severe to profound [[Retinitis Pigmentosa]] (RP).
2.  **Age:** 25 years or older.
3.  **Visual Status:** Progression to "bare light perception" or "no light perception" in both eyes.
4.  **History:** A previous history of useful form vision (the patient must have seen shapes/forms in the past).
5.  **Lens Status:** [[Aphakia]] or [[Pseudophakia]] (if phakic, lens extraction is performed during implantation).
6.  **Compliance:** Willingness to undergo postoperative follow-up, device fitting, and visual rehabilitation.

> **Mnemonic for Patient Criteria: "OLD-P"**
> *   **O**ld enough (25+ years)
> *   **L**ight perception absent/bare
> *   **D**isease is RP
> *   **P**revious useful vision

**Surgical Procedure**
The implantation is a complex procedure performed under **General Anaesthesia**:
*   **Vitrectomy:** Removal of [[Vitreous Humour]] and any membranes on the retinal surface.
*   **Placement:** The implant is positioned on the surface of the retina ([[Epiretinal Implant]]).
*   **Fixation:** The array is attached to the retina using a retinal tack.
*   **Cabling:** Connection cables run through the [[Pars Plana]] (the region where the iris and sclera touch).

**Clinical Outcomes**
*   **Visual Field:** The device aims to restore central **20° vision**.
*   **Perception:** It does not restore normal vision but provides "phosphenes" (spots of light) that allow the patient to detect motion, shapes, and contrast, aiding in mobility and orientation.

**Complications and Side Effects**
Serious adverse events recorded in clinical trials include:
*   [[Hypotony]] (Lower than normal intraocular pressure).
*   **Conjunctival Erosion**.
*   **Wound Dehiscence** (Reopening of the surgical wound).
*   [[Endophthalmitis]] (Intraocular inflammation/infection).
*   **Risk of Infection** from implanted cables.
*   [[Retinal Detachment]].

**Clinical Implications**
*   **Rehabilitation:** Post-operative visual rehabilitation is critical. The brain must "learn" to interpret the electrical signals as visual images.
*   **Limitations:** The resolution is low (60 pixels/electrodes), sufficient for gross navigation but not for high-acuity tasks like reading standard text.
