# [[Preventive Medicine In Obstetrics, Paediatrics And Geriatrics]] > Geriatric Health Problems

### **Geriatric Health Problems**

**Geriatrics** is the branch of medicine concerned with the health and care of the elderly. In India, people aged **60 years and above** are considered elderly/geriatric population. **Gerontology** is the scientific study of the ageing process.

Aging is a physiological phenomenon, but it is often accompanied by a decline in biological efficiency and an accumulation of chronic disorders.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a flowchart classifying Geriatric Problems into 4 main branches: 1. Problems due to Ageing Process (Physiological), 2. Pathological Problems (Chronic Diseases), 3. Psychological Problems, 4. Social Problems

### **1. Problems Due to the Ageing Process (Physiological)**
These are disabilities incident to the biological process of ageing (Senescence).
*   **Vision:** [[Senile Cataract]], Glaucoma, Presbyopia (farsightedness).
*   **Hearing:** Nerve deafness ([[Presbycusis]]).
*   **Respiratory:** [[Emphysema]] (loss of lung elasticity).
*   **Musculoskeletal:** Osteoporosis causing limited mobility and fragility.
*   **Genitourinary:** Enlargement of the prostate ([[BPH]]) in males leading to dysuria/frequency; urinary incontinence.
*   **Neurological:** Slowing of reflexes, failure of special senses.

### **2. Pathological Problems (Chronic Diseases)**
The elderly are prone to "degenerative diseases" and often suffer from **multiple pathologies** simultaneously.

| System | Common Conditions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cardiovascular** | [[Hypertension]], Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD), Atherosclerosis, Heart Failure. |
| **Locomotor** | [[Osteoarthritis]], Rheumatoid arthritis, Gout, Spondylitis, Fibrositis. |
| **Metabolic/Endocrine** | [[Diabetes Mellitus]] (Type 2), Obesity. |
| **Respiratory** | Chronic Bronchitis, Asthma. |
| **Oncology** | Cancer incidence rises after 40. Common sites: Prostate (men), Cervix/Breast (women). |
| **Accidents/Trauma** | **Falls** are a major cause of morbidity (Fracture neck of femur is common due to brittle bones). |

> **Clinical Relevance:** **Polypharmacy** (use of multiple drugs) is a significant issue in geriatrics due to multiple co-morbidities, leading to increased risk of adverse drug reactions and interactions.

### **3. Psychological Problems**
Mental changes are often an inevitable accompaniment of old age, exacerbated by social factors.
*   **Cognitive Decline:** Impaired memory, [[Senile Dementia]], [[Alzheimer's Disease]].
*   **Emotional Disorders:** Depression is very common due to loss of spouse, isolation, or chronic illness.
*   **Sexual Adjustment:**
    *   **Men:** Diminished sexual activity/impotence.
    *   **Women:** [[Menopause]] leading to physical and emotional changes.
*   **Behavioral:** Rigidity of outlook, irritability, inner withdrawal.

### **4. Social Problems**
In developing countries like India, social problems are often as debilitating as medical ones.
*   **Economic Dependence:** Loss of income after retirement; poverty.
*   **Social Isolation:** Breakdown of the [[Joint Family System]], rise of nuclear families, loss of spouse/peers leads to loneliness.
*   **Status:** Loss of social status and decision-making power in the family.
*   **Generation Gap:** Maladjustment with the younger generation.

### **Prevention and Control (Levels of Prevention)**

#### **A. Primary Prevention (Health Promotion)**
*   **Healthy Lifestyle:** Encouraging physical activity to prevent muscle atrophy and osteoporosis.
*   **Nutrition:** Balanced diet rich in Calcium and Iron; reducing salt and saturated fats to control HTN and CVD.
*   **Addiction Control:** Cessation of [[Smoking]] and Alcohol.
*   **Injury Prevention:** Safe home environment (e.g., grab bars in toilets) to prevent falls.
*   **Preparation for Retirement:** Financial and psychological planning before actual retirement.

#### **B. Secondary Prevention (Early Diagnosis and Treatment)**
*   **Screening:** Regular periodic health check-ups for:
    *   Hypertension (BP measurement).
    *   Diabetes (Blood sugar).
    *   Vision (Cataract) and Hearing.
    *   Cancer (Pap smear, prostate exam).
*   **Curative Services:** Setting up separate **Geriatric wards/OPDs** to avoid long queues for the elderly.

#### **C. Tertiary Prevention (Rehabilitation)**
*   **Disability Limitation:** Intensive treatment of chronic conditions (e.g., stroke management).
*   **Rehabilitation:**
    *   **Medical:** Cataract surgery, hearing aids, dentures, joint replacements.
    *   **Social:** Old age homes, day-care centers, pension schemes.

### **Mnemonic for Geriatric Assessment**
**"D E E P I N"**
*   **D** - **D**ementia/Depression
*   **E** - **E**ye (Cataract/Glaucoma)
*   **E** - **E**ar (Deafness)
*   **P** - **P**hysical (Falls/Osteoporosis)
*   **I** - **I**ncontinence (Urinary)
*   **N** - **N**utrition (Anemia/Malnutrition)

### **National Initiatives in India**
1.  **National Policy on Older Persons (1999):** Focuses on financial security, health care, and shelter.
2.  **[[NPHCE]] (National Programme for Health Care of the Elderly):**
    *   Launched in 2010.
    *   Aims to provide separate, specialized, and comprehensive healthcare to senior citizens.
    *   Includes geriatric OPDs and wards at District Hospitals and Regional Geriatric Centres.
3.  **Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act (2007):** Legal framework to ensure children provide maintenance to parents.
