# [[Anatomy And Physiology]] > Anatomy of Eyeball

### **Gross Anatomy of the Eyeball**

The human [[eyeball]] is a cystic structure kept distended by the intraocular pressure inside it. It acts as a camera, perceiving images and relaying sensations to the visual cortex via the [[visual pathway]].

#### **1. General Features and Shape**
*   **Shape:** The eyeball is **not a perfect sphere**. It is described as an **aspherical** or **oblate spheroid**.
*   **Composition:** It consists of two modified spheres fused together:
    *   **Anterior sphere:** Smaller, forms the **[[cornea]]** (radius of curvature ~7.8 mm).
    *   **Posterior sphere:** Larger, forms the **[[sclera]]** (radius of curvature ~12 mm).
*   **Location:** It is situated in the anterior part of the bony **[[orbit]]**.
*   **Poles:**
    *   **Anterior Pole:** The central point of the anterior curvature (cornea).
    *   **Posterior Pole:** The central point of the posterior curvature.
*   **Equator:** The mid-plane lying equidistant between the two poles.

#### **2. Dimensions of an Adult Eyeball**

The following are the standard dimensions of a normal adult eyeball:

| Parameter | Measurement | Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Anteroposterior (AP) Diameter** | **24 mm** | **1 mm change** in axial length leads to **~3 Diopters** change in refractive power. Short AP diameter = [[Hypermetropia]]; Long AP diameter = [[Myopia]]. |
| **Horizontal Diameter** | **23.5 mm** | Slightly less than AP diameter. |
| **Vertical Diameter** | **23 mm** | Slightly less than horizontal diameter. |
| **Circumference** | **75 mm** | Important for surgical calculations (e.g., retinal detachment surgery). |
| **Volume** | **6.5 mL** | Varies slightly (6–7 mL). |
| **Weight** | **7 gm** | - |

### **Coats (Tunics) of the Eyeball**

The wall of the eyeball is composed of three concentric coats:

#### **1. Fibrous Coat (Outer Layer)**
This is a dense, strong wall that protects the intraocular contents and maintains the shape of the globe.
*   **[[Cornea]]:** The anterior **1/6th**. It is transparent and responsible for the majority of the eye's refractive power.
*   **[[Sclera]]:** The posterior **5/6th**. It is opaque and white in color.
*   **[[Limbus]]:** The junction between the cornea and the sclera. The [[conjunctiva]] is firmly attached here.

#### **2. Vascular Coat (Middle Layer / Uveal Tract)**
This layer is highly vascular and pigmented. It supplies nutrition to various ocular structures. It consists of three parts (from anterior to posterior):
*   **[[Iris]]:** The anterior-most part, forming a diaphragm with a central aperture called the **[[pupil]]**.
*   **[[Ciliary Body]]:** Divided into **Pars Plicata** (anterior, secretes aqueous) and **Pars Plana** (posterior, avascular). It contains the [[ciliary muscle]] responsible for [[accommodation]].
*   **[[Choroid]]:** The posterior part lining the sclera, highly vascular, providing nutrition to the outer layers of the [[retina]].

#### **3. Nervous Coat (Inner Layer)**
*   **[[Retina]]:** The innermost neurosensory layer concerned with visual functions.
*   It extends from the **[[optic disc]]** posteriorly to the **[[ora serrata]]** anteriorly.
*   It consists of 10 distinct layers, including the **[[photoreceptors]]** (rods and cones) and the **[[Retinal Pigment Epithelium]]** (RPE).

### **Segments and Chambers of the Eye**

The eyeball is divided into two segments by the crystalline **[[lens]]** and its suspensory ligaments (**[[zonules]]**).

#### **A. Anterior Segment**
Includes structures anterior to the lens and vitreous face.
*   **Boundaries:** Includes the cornea, iris, ciliary body, and lens.
*   **Subdivisions:** It is divided by the **[[iris]]** into two chambers filled with **[[aqueous humour]]**:
    1.  **[[Anterior Chamber]] (AC):**
        *   Bounded anteriorly by the back of the cornea and posteriorly by the iris and central lens capsule.
        *   **Depth:** **2.5 mm** in the center (variable; shallower in hypermetropia, deeper in myopia).
        *   **Volume:** **0.25 mL**.
    2.  **[[Posterior Chamber]] (PC):**
        *   A triangular space bounded anteriorly by the iris, posteriorly by the lens/zonules, and laterally by the ciliary body.
        *   **Volume:** **0.06 mL**.

**Clinical Implication:**
*   A shallow **Anterior Chamber** predisposes to **[[Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma]]**.
*   Total aqueous volume (AC + PC) = **0.31 mL**.

#### **B. Posterior Segment**
Includes structures posterior to the lens.
*   **Contents:**
    *   **[[Vitreous Humour]]:** A gel-like structure filling the space behind the lens (volume approx. 4 mL).
    *   **Retina**, **Choroid**, and **Optic Disc**.
