# Vocal Cord Paralysis

[[Vocal cord paralysis]] refers to the immobility of the true vocal cord resulting from the disruption of motor innervation to the laryngeal musculature. It is a sign of an underlying disease rather than a diagnosis in itself.

## Relevant Anatomy and Physiology

The [[larynx]] is innervated by the [[vagus nerve]] (CN X) through two main branches:

1.  **Superior Laryngeal Nerve (SLN):**
    *   **Internal branch:** Sensory supply to the supraglottis (above vocal cords).
    *   **External branch:** Motor supply to the [[cricothyroid muscle]] (tensor of the vocal cord).
2.  **Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve (RLN):**
    *   Supplies all intrinsic muscles of the larynx **except** the cricothyroid.
    *   Provides sensory supply to the glottis and subglottis.
    *   **Course:**
        *   **Right RLN:** Loops around the right subclavian artery.
        *   **Left RLN:** Loops around the arch of the aorta (longer course, higher risk of injury).

### Vocal Cord Positions
The resting position of the paralyzed cord aids in localizing the lesion:

| Position | Distance from Midline | Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Median** | Midline | Phonation; also seen in [[Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Paralysis]] |
| **Paramedian** | 1.5 mm | Strong whisper; seen in [[Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Paralysis]] |
| **Intermediate (Cadaveric)** | 3.5 mm | Neutral position; seen in **Combined (Complete) Paralysis** (RLN + SLN) |
| **Gentle Abduction** | 7 mm | Quiet respiration |
| **Full Abduction** | 9.5 mm | Deep inspiration |

**Key Theories regarding Cord Position:**
*   **Wagner and Grossman Theory:** In RLN paralysis, the cricothyroid muscle (supplied by SLN) is intact. As an adductor, it keeps the cord in the paramedian position. If both RLN and SLN are paralyzed, the cord moves to the cadaveric position.
*   **Semon's Law:** In progressive organic lesions, abductor fibers (phylogenetically newer) are paralyzed before adductor fibers.

## Etiology

The causes can be Supranuclear, Nuclear, or Peripheral (High Vagal or Low Vagal).

### General Causes
*   **Malignancy:** Non-laryngeal malignancies (e.g., thyroid, bronchogenic, esophageal) are a leading cause.
*   **Iatrogenic/Surgical:** Thyroidectomy (most common for bilateral), anterior cervical spine surgery, cardiac surgery, skull base surgery.
*   **Idiopathic:** Often viral etiology (HSV, EBV); diagnosis of exclusion.
*   **Trauma:** Intubation, neck trauma.
*   **Neurological:** Stroke, [[Arnold-Chiari malformation]] (in children), [[Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis]].

> **Clinical Implication:** **Ortner’s Syndrome (Cardiovocal Syndrome):** Left RLN palsy caused by left atrial enlargement (e.g., in mitral stenosis) compressing the nerve against the aorta.

## Types of Paralysis

### 1. Unilateral Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Paralysis
This is the most common form of vocal cord palsy.

*   **Pathophysiology:** The adductor and abductor muscles are paralyzed, but the cricothyroid (tensor/adductor) remains intact.
*   **Cord Position:** **Median** or **Paramedian**.
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Voice:** Hoarseness, breathy voice, vocal fatigue. Voice may be normal if compensation occurs.
    *   **Airway:** Usually normal (one cord abducts normally).
    *   **Aspiration:** Rare/None (sensation is intact).
*   **Management:**
    *   **Conservative:** Wait and watch for 6–12 months for spontaneous recovery or compensation by the healthy cord.
    *   **Speech Therapy:** To optimize voice production.
    *   **Surgery (if no recovery):** [[Thyroplasty Type I]] (Medialization) or injection laryngoplasty.

### 2. Bilateral Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Paralysis (Bilateral Abductor Palsy)
This is a life-threatening condition due to airway compromise.

*   **Etiology:** Thyroidectomy (most common), malignancy, intubation trauma.
*   **Cord Position:** Both cords in **Median** or **Paramedian** position.
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Airway:** **Stridor** (inspiratory), dyspnea, respiratory distress on exertion.
    *   **Voice:** Often **Good/Normal** (because cords are approximated in midline).
*   **Management:**
    *   **Emergency:** [[Tracheostomy]] to secure the airway.
    *   **Definitive (to improve airway):**
        *   **Lateralization procedures:** [[Cordectomy]] (laser), [[Arytenoidectomy]], or [[Thyroplasty Type II]] (Lateralization).
        *   *Note:* Improving the airway usually worsens the voice.

### 3. Superior Laryngeal Nerve (SLN) Paralysis
Usually occurs with high vagal lesions. Isolated lesions are rare.

*   **Defect:** Paralysis of [[cricothyroid muscle]] (loss of tension) and anesthesia of supraglottis.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Askew Glottis:** Posterior commissure deviates to the *paralyzed* side; anterior commissure rotates to the *healthy* side.
    *   **Wavy Cord:** The paralyzed cord appears bowed or wavy due to loss of tension.
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Inability to raise the pitch of the voice (loss of singing voice).
    *   Voice fatigue.
    *   Occasional aspiration (due to sensory loss).

### 4. Combined (Complete) Paralysis
Involves both RLN and SLN (High Vagal Palsy).

*   **Etiology:** Skull base tumors (e.g., [[Glomus jugulare]], [[Nasopharyngeal carcinoma]]), brainstem lesions.
*   **Cord Position:** **Cadaveric (Intermediate)** position (3.5 mm from midline).
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Voice:** **Aphonia** or severe breathiness (severe glottic incompetence).
    *   **Aspiration:** Severe (due to wide glottic chink + anesthesia of larynx).
    *   **Cough:** Ineffective (bovine cough).
*   **Management:**
    *   **Unilateral:** Medialization procedures (Thyroplasty Type I).
    *   **Bilateral:** Tracheostomy (for airway) + [[Epiglottopexy]] or vocal cord plication (to prevent aspiration), or [[Tracheoesophageal diversion]].

## Investigation Protocol

1.  **History:** Surgery, trauma, malignancy, viral illness.
2.  **Examination:** Complete head and neck exam (thyroid, cranial nerves).
3.  **Laryngoscopy:**
    *   **Flexible Fiberoptic Laryngoscopy:** To assess cord position and mobility.
    *   **Videostroboscopy:** To differentiate paralysis from fixation (cricoarytenoid joint).
4.  **Imaging:**
    *   **CT/MRI:** From **skull base to diaphragm** (to trace the entire course of the vagus/RLN).
    *   Chest X-ray: To rule out apical lung mass/mediastinal widening.
5.  **Laryngeal Electromyography (LEMG):**
    *   Differentiates paralysis (neurologic) from fixation (mechanical).
    *   Differentiates fixation from dislocation.
    *   Prognostic value: Distinguishes neurotmesis (poor prognosis) from neuropraxia.

## Surgical Management: Phonosurgery

Surgical intervention is generally termed **Phonosurgery** or **Laryngeal Framework Surgery**.

### Thyroplasty (Isshiki Classification)

| Type | Action | Indication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type I** | **Medialization** (inward displacement) | Unilateral vocal cord paralysis (Adductor palsy) to improve voice. |
| **Type II** | **Lateralization** (outward displacement) | Bilateral abductor paralysis (to improve airway). |
| **Type III** | **Shortening** (Relaxation) | To lower pitch (e.g., [[Puberphonia]], Gender reassignment female-to-male). |
| **Type IV** | **Lengthening** (Tensioning) | To raise pitch (e.g., [[Androphonia]], Gender reassignment male-to-female). |

### Mnemonic for Thyroplasty
*   **M**edialization (Type I)
*   **L**ateralization (Type II)
*   **S**hortening (Type III)
*   **T**ensioning (Type IV)
*(Remember: **M**y **L**ittle **S**hort **T**ea-cup)*

### Other Procedures
*   **Injection Laryngoplasty:** Injection of materials (Teflon, fat, collagen, hyaluronic acid) to bulk up the cord.
*   **Arytenoid Adduction:** Used with Type I thyroplasty to close the posterior glottic gap.
*   **Kashima’s Operation:** Endoscopic posterior cordectomy (laser) for bilateral abductor palsy to widen the airway.
*   **Woodman's Operation:** External arytenoidectomy for bilateral abductor palsy.
