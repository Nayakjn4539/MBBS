# Boxer's Fracture

### Definition
**Boxer's fracture** is a specific type of [[hand fracture]] involving the **neck** of the [[fifth metacarpal]]. While occasionally used to describe fractures of the fourth metacarpal neck, the term classically refers to the fifth ray. It is an **extra-articular fracture**.

### Mechanism of Injury
*   **Direct Trauma:** Usually sustained when a clenched fist strikes a hard object (e.g., a wall, a jaw, or a skull) with significant force.
*   **Axial Loading:** The force is transmitted axially through the [[metacarpal head]], causing a fracture at the weakest point, the **neck**.
*   **Displacement:** The distal fragment (the metacarpal head) typically tilts **volarly** (palmar direction) and may be impacted. This angulation occurs due to the force of impact and the pull of the [[intrinsic muscles]] (interossei and lumbricals).

### Clinical Features
*   **History:** The patient usually gives a history of punching a hard object or being involved in a fight.
*   **Pain and Swelling:** Localized over the ulnar side of the hand (dorsum).
*   **Deformity:**
    *   **Loss of Knuckle Prominence:** The normal prominence of the fifth knuckle (metacarpal head) is lost or depressed because the head has angulated into the palm.
    *   **Volar Fulness:** The head may be palpable in the palm.
*   **Tenderness:** Point tenderness over the [[fifth metacarpal neck]].
*   **Rotational Deformity:** It is crucial to check for malrotation. When the patient makes a fist, the little finger should point toward the [[scaphoid]]; if it overlaps the ring finger, rotational malalignment is present.

### Radiological Features
*   **X-rays:** Anteroposterior (AP), Lateral, and Oblique views of the hand are required.
*   **Findings:**
    *   Transverse or oblique fracture line through the **neck** of the [[fifth metacarpal]].
    *   **Volar angulation** (apex dorsal) of the distal fragment.
    *   Check for any associated fractures of the [[fourth metacarpal]].

### Management

The management depends on the degree of angulation and stability. The fifth carpometacarpal (CMC) joint is very mobile, allowing for significant compensation for deformity.

#### 1. Conservative Management
Most Boxer's fractures can be treated non-operatively.
*   **Indications:**
    *   Closed fractures.
    *   No rotational deformity.
    *   **Acceptable Angulation:** Up to **40°–50°** of volar angulation is acceptable for the fifth metacarpal neck because the mobility of the CMC joint allows the hand to compensate without significant functional loss. (Note: Only up to 20° is accepted for the 2nd and 3rd metacarpals).
*   **Technique:**
    *   **Ulnar Gutter Splint:** Immobilization of the ring and little fingers.
    *   **Position of Safe Immobilization (James Position):**
        *   Wrist in extension (20°–30°).
        *   **Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints** in **flexion (70°–90°)** to keep the collateral ligaments taut and prevent stiffness.
        *   **Interphalangeal (IP) joints** in **extension**.
    *   **Strapping:** In mild cases or stable fractures, "Buddy strapping" the little finger to the ring finger may suffice, allowing early mobilization.
    *   **Duration:** Splint for approximately 3 weeks, followed by mobilization.

#### 2. Operative Management
*   **Indications:**
    *   **Severe Angulation:** >50°–60° or significant cosmetic deformity (loss of knuckle).
    *   **Rotational Deformity:** Scissoring of fingers upon making a fist.
    *   **Open Fractures:** Require debridement.
    *   **Multiple Fractures:** Involvement of multiple metacarpals.
*   **Methods:**
    *   **Closed Reduction and Percutaneous Pinning (CRPP):**
        *   *Jahss Maneuver:* The finger is flexed 90° at the MCP and PIP joints; upward pressure is applied on the proximal phalanx while downward pressure is applied on the metacarpal shaft to reduce the angulation.
        *   **K-wire Fixation:** Once reduced, the fracture is stabilized using [[Kirschner wires]] (K-wires). These can be inserted in a criss-cross fashion, intramedullary (Bouquet technique), or transversely into the adjacent fourth metacarpal.
    *   **Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF):** Using mini-plates and screws (rarely needed for simple neck fractures, more common for shaft or complex injuries).

### Complications
*   **Malunion:**
    *   **Cosmetic:** Loss of the knuckle prominence (most common).
    *   **Functional:** If severe volar angulation persists, the metacarpal head may be prominent in the palm, causing pain during gripping or reducing grip strength.
*   **Stiffness:** Extension contracture of the [[metacarpophalangeal joint]] if immobilized in extension (collateral ligaments shorten).
*   **Rotational Malalignment:** If not corrected, fingers overlap when making a fist.
*   **Skin Necrosis:** If splints are applied too tightly over the dorsum of the hand.

### Clinical Implication: The "Fight Bite"
If a Boxer's fracture is associated with a break in the skin over the knuckle (often caused by the opponent's tooth), it must be treated as a human bite injury ("Fight Bite").
*   **Risk:** High risk of infection, particularly **Eikenella corrodens** and **Staphylococcus aureus**.
*   **Action:** Requires aggressive irrigation, debridement, and antibiotics. The wound should generally **not** be closed primarily (sutured) due to infection risk.

### Mnemonic
**B-O-X-E-R**
*   **B**reak in the 5th Metacarpal Neck
*   **O**bvious loss of knuckle
*   **X**-ray confirms volar angulation
*   **E**xtra-articular
*   **R**otational check is mandatory (make a fist)
