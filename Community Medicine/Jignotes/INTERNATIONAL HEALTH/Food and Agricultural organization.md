# [[INTERNATIONAL HEALTH]] > Food and Agricultural organization

### Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)

**[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO)** is the first specialized agency of the [[United Nations]], created to look after several areas of world cooperation regarding food and nutrition.

#### 1. General Information
*   **Established:** 16th October 1945.
*   **Headquarters:** **Rome**, Italy.
*   **Motto:** *Fiat Panis* (Let there be bread).

> **Mnemonic for Headquarters:**
> **F**ood **A**lways **O**riginates in **Rome** (Think of Pizza/Pasta!).

#### 2. Chief Aims and Objectives
The primary objective is to ensure that food is consumed by the people who need it, in sufficient quantities and right proportions. The specific aims are:
1.  To help nations **raise living standards**.
2.  To **improve [[nutrition]]** of the people of all countries.
3.  To increase the **efficiency of farming**, forestry, and fisheries.
4.  To better the conditions of **rural people**.
5.  To widen the opportunity for **productive work**.

> **Mnemonic for Aims: RICE**
> *   **R** - Raise living standards
> *   **I** - Improve Nutrition
> *   **C** - Cultivate efficiency (Farming/Fisheries)
> *   **E** - Elevate rural conditions

#### 3. Key Activities and Programs
*   **Focus on Production:** The prime concern is the increased production of food to keep pace with the ever-growing world population.
*   **Freedom from Hunger Campaign (FFHC):** Launched in **1960**. The main object is to combat [[malnutrition]] and disseminate information and education.
*   **Applied Nutrition Programmes (ANP):** Collaborates with other international agencies (like [[UNICEF]] and [[WHO]]) to support these programs in rural areas.

#### 4. Collaboration with WHO (Joint Activities)
FAO works in close collaboration with the [[World Health Organization]] on matters where health and food overlap:
*   **[[Codex Alimentarius Commission]]:** Established jointly in **1963** to formulate international food standards to protect consumer health and ensure fair trade practices.
*   **Zoonoses Control:** Coordination of research and control programs for [[Zoonoses]] (diseases transmitted from animals to humans), such as **[[Brucellosis]]**.
*   **Nutritional Surveys:** Conducting surveys and training courses.

#### Quick Summary Table

| Feature | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Type** | First Specialized Agency of UN |
| **Year** | 1945 |
| **HQ** | Rome |
| **Primary Focus** | Agriculture, Food Security, Nutrition, Rural Development |
| **Major Campaign** | Freedom from Hunger Campaign (1960) |
| **Joint Body** | Codex Alimentarius Commission (with WHO) |

#### Clinical and Public Health Relevance
*   **Food Safety:** Through the [[Codex Alimentarius]], FAO helps prevent [[food adulteration]] and food-borne illnesses, which is vital for community health.
*   **Zoonotic Diseases:** Control of diseases in animals (veterinary public health) directly prevents outbreaks in human populations (e.g., Avian Influenza, Brucellosis).
*   **Nutritional Status:** By improving food production and distribution, FAO directly impacts the prevalence of **[[Protein Energy Malnutrition]]** and micronutrient deficiencies.
