# [[OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH]] > In an accident in a factory, a male worker lost his left lower limb below thigh. Enumerate the benefits he is entitled to under ESI Act. In case of death of the worker what are the benefits his family is entitled to get? What are the steps to be taken to prevent future occurrence?

### Benefits Entitled to the Injured Worker Under [[ESI Act, 1948]]

The [[Employees' State Insurance Act]], 1948 provides comprehensive social security. For a male worker who has lost his left lower limb below the thigh due to an employment injury, the following benefits are applicable:

| Benefit Category | Description & Entitlement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. [[Medical Benefit]]** | • **Full Medical Care:** Free treatment including hospitalization, drugs, and specialist consultation.<br>• **Specific to Injury:** Free supply of **Artificial Limbs** (prosthetics) and necessary appliances (e.g., crutches, wheelchair) to the insured person who loses a limb.<br>• **Duration:** Available from day one of entering insurable employment. |
| **2. [[Disablement Benefit]]** | • **Temporary Disablement Benefit:** Cash payment at **90% of average daily wages** as long as the temporary disability lasts (during the healing period of the stump) and the worker is unable to work.<br>• **Permanent Disablement Benefit:** Since the limb is lost, this is a permanent disability. He is entitled to a **Life Pension** (cash). The rate is calculated based on the loss of earning capacity determined by a **Medical Board**. For total permanent disablement, it is approx. 90% of wages; for partial (like limb loss), it is proportional to the loss of earning capacity. |
| **3. [[Rehabilitation Benefit]]** | • **Vocational Rehabilitation:** Training at Vocational Rehabilitation Centres.<br>• **Physical Rehabilitation:** If admitted to an artificial limb center for the fitting/replacement of the limb, he is entitled to a **Rehabilitation Allowance** (100% of daily average wage) for each day of admission. |
| **4. [[Sickness Benefit]]** | • Though primarily for sickness, if required, cash benefit at **70% of wages** is available for up to 91 days in a year (provided contribution conditions are met). |

### Steps to Prevent Future Occurrence (Prevention of [[Industrial Accidents]])

Prevention requires a multidisciplinary approach involving medical, engineering, and administrative measures.

#### A. Medical Measures
1.  **[[Pre-placement Examination]]:** Ensure **Ergonomics** (fitting the worker to the job). Do not assign jobs involving heavy machinery to workers with physical limitations (e.g., poor vision, epilepsy).
2.  **Periodical Examination:** Regular health checkups to detect physiological fatigue or stress that may predispose to accidents.
3.  **Detection of Accident Proneness:** Identifying workers who repeatedly commit unsafe acts or have psychological stress factors.

#### B. Engineering and Environmental Measures
1.  **Proper Design & Layout:** ensuring adequate floor space (minimum **500 cu. ft** per worker) to prevent overcrowding.
2.  **[[Fencing of Machinery]]:** Strict enforcement of the **Factories Act, 1948** regarding encasing moving parts, fencing dangerous machines, and using safety guards.
3.  **Maintenance:** Regular checking of boilers, cranes, and hoists to prevent mechanical failure.
4.  **Environmental Control:**
    *   **Illumination:** Adequate lighting to prevent visual errors (minimum 6–12 foot candles for regular work).
    *   **Temperature/Ventilation:** Controlling heat and humidity to prevent fatigue and heat syncope.
    *   **Noise Control:** Reducing noise levels to allow clear communication of warnings.

#### C. Administrative and Educational Measures
1.  **[[Safety Education]]:** Training workers on safe operating procedures and the importance of using **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**.
2.  **Safety Officer:** Appointment of a Safety Officer is mandatory in factories employing **1,000 or more workers**.
3.  **Reporting and Analysis:** Proper notification of all accidents and analyzing the root cause to implement corrective actions.
4.  **Psychological Environment:** Reducing shift-work stress and maintaining good human relations to prevent mental fatigue and negligence.
