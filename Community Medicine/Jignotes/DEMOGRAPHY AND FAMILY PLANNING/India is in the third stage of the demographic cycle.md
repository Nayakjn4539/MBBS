# [[DEMOGRAPHY AND FAMILY PLANNING]] > India is in the third stage of the demographic cycle

### India and the Demographic Cycle

Based on the current demographic data and trends, India is currently in the **Third Stage** of the [[Demographic Cycle]], also known as the **Late Expanding Phase**.

#### Characteristics of the Third Stage (Late Expanding)
This stage is characterized by the following features regarding vital rates:
*   **Death Rate (DR):** Declines further and stabilizes at a low level.
*   **Birth Rate (BR):** Tends to **fall** or start declining.
*   **Population Growth:** The population continues to **grow** because the number of births still exceeds the number of deaths. However, the rate of growth begins to slow down compared to the explosive growth of the second stage.
*   **Demographic Gap:** The gap between births and deaths (Demographic Gap) starts **decreasing** or narrowing.

#### Historical Progression of India in the Cycle
1.  **First Stage ([[High Stationary]]):**
    *   **Time Period:** India was in this stage until **1920**.
    *   **Features:** High Birth Rate and High Death Rate cancel each other out, resulting in a **stationary** population.
    *   **Note:** The year 1921 is often referred to as the "**Year of the Great Divide**" in Indian demography as population growth started consistently increasing after this point.

2.  **Second Stage ([[Early Expanding]]):**
    *   **Features:** The Death Rate begins to decline sharply (due to better disease control and food supply), while the Birth Rate remains **unchanged** or high.
    *   **Result:** This creates a wide demographic gap, leading to a **population explosion**. Many South Asian and African countries are still in this phase.

3.  **Third Stage (Current Status):**
    *   India has entered this phase where the **birth rate has started to decline** alongside the already low death rate.
    *   **Implication:** This stage offers a **[[Demographic Gift]]** or "Demographic Dividend," where there is a higher proportion of the population in the economically productive age group (working age) leading to a lower dependency ratio.

#### Summary of Stages

| Stage | Name | Birth Rate (BR) | Death Rate (DR) | Population Change | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I** | **High Stationary** | High | High | Stationary | India (pre-1920) |
| **II** | **Early Expanding** | High | Declining | Rapid Increase | Many African nations |
| **III** | **Late Expanding** | **Declining** | **Declining** | **Increasing** | **[[INDIA]]** |
| **IV** | **Low Stationary** | Low | Low | Stationary | UK, Denmark, Sweden |
| **V** | **Declining** | Very Low | Low (BR < DR) | Declining | Germany, Hungary |
