# Conjunctival Cysts

### Overview
[[Conjunctival cysts]] are thin-walled sacs containing fluid located within the substance of the [[conjunctiva]]. They are relatively common and can be congenital, degenerative, inflammatory, or parasitic in origin. Most are benign and asymptomatic, but larger cysts can cause irritation or cosmetic concern.

### Classification of Conjunctival Cysts

These lesions can be broadly classified based on their etiology:

1.  **Congenital Cysts**
2.  **Lymphatic Cysts**
3.  **Retention Cysts**
4.  **Epithelial Implantation Cysts**
5.  **Parasitic Cysts**
6.  **Miscellaneous Cysts**

### Detailed Description of Cyst Types

#### 1. Congenital Cystic Lesions
These are rare conditions usually present at birth.
*   **[[Congenital corneoscleral cyst]]:** A rare anomaly at the limbus.
*   **Cystic form of [[Epibulbar dermoid]]:** While dermoids are usually solid choristomas, cystic variants can occur.

#### 2. Lymphatic Cysts
These arise from the dilatation of [[lymphatic vessels]] in the [[bulbar conjunctiva]].
*   **[[Lymphangiectasis]]:**
    *   **Appearance:** Characterized by a row of small, clear, transparent cysts or channels on the bulbar conjunctiva.
    *   **Pathology:** Dilation of lymph spaces.
    *   **Clinical Course:** Usually asymptomatic but can fill with blood ([[hemorrhagic lymphangiectasia]]) spontaneously or after minor trauma.
*   **[[Lymphangioma]]:**
    *   **Appearance:** Typically presents as a single, solitary but **multilocular cyst**.
    *   **Nature:** It is a vascular hamartoma primarily consisting of lymphatic channels.

#### 3. Retention Cysts
These are formed due to the blockage of ducts of glands present in the conjunctiva.
*   **Etiology:** Blockage of the ducts of **[[Accessory lacrimal glands of Krause]]**.
*   **Predisposing Factors:** Chronic inflammatory conditions such as [[Trachoma]] and [[Pemphigus]].
*   **Location:** More common in the **[[Upper fornix]]**.
*   **Appearance:** Asymptomatic, thin-walled lesions containing clear fluid.

#### 4. Epithelial Implantation Cysts (Traumatic Cysts)
These occur when conjunctival epithelium is buried or displaced into the deeper subconjunctival tissue.
*   **Etiology:**
    *   **Trauma:** Penetrating or non-surgical injuries.
    *   **Surgery:** Common complication following **[[Squint surgery]]** (strabismus surgery) or other ocular surface operations.
*   **Pathogenesis:** The implanted epithelium proliferates to form a cyst lined by non-keratinizing squamous epithelium.
*   **Appearance:** A pearl-like, solid or fluid-filled nodule.

#### 5. Parasitic Cysts
These are not infrequent in developing countries.
*   **[[Subconjunctival cysticercosis]]:** Caused by the larval stage of *Taenia solium*. It presents as a painless, mobile subconjunctival nodule. The scolex may sometimes be visible.
*   **[[Hydatid cyst]]:** Caused by *Echinococcus granulosus*.
*   **[[Filarial cyst]]:** Rare accumulation related to filariasis.

#### 6. Miscellaneous Cysts
*   **Aqueous Cyst:** Formed due to healing by "cystoid cicatrix" following perforating [[limbal wounds]] (surgical or non-surgical), allowing aqueous humor to leak under the conjunctiva.
*   **Pigmented Epithelial Cyst:** Rare cysts formed following prolonged topical use of **[[Epinephrine]]** or **[[Cocaine]]**.
*   **Cystic Degeneration in [[Pterygium]]:** Epithelial cysts due to downgrowth of epithelium can occur within a pterygium.

### Comparison of Common Conjunctival Cysts

| Cyst Type | Etiology/Origin | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Lymphangiectasis]]** | Dilated lymphatics | Rows of small, clear cysts on bulbar conjunctiva. |
| **[[Retention cyst]]** | Blocked ducts of Krause glands | Thin-walled, clear fluid; common in upper fornix. |
| **[[Implantation cyst]]** | Trauma or Surgery | Pearl-like; history of squint surgery or injury. |
| **[[Cysticercosis]]** | Parasitic (*Taenia solium*) | Mobile nodule; scolex may be visible. |

### Management

**1. Observation**
*   Small, asymptomatic cysts do not require active treatment.

**2. Surgical Excision**
*   **Indication:** Cosmetic disfigurement or foreign body sensation.
*   **Procedure:** Complete careful surgical excision under local anesthesia is the treatment of choice.
    *   *Note:* Simple removal of the anterior wall of the cyst may be sufficient for non-parasitic fluid-filled cysts.
*   **Histopathology:** The excised cyst should always be subjected to histopathological examination to rule out malignancy or confirm parasitic etiology.

**3. Specific Management**
*   **Parasitic Cysts:** Require surgical removal of the intact cyst to prevent severe inflammatory reaction. Systemic evaluation for neurocysticercosis is often indicated.
