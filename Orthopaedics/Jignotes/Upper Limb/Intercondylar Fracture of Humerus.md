# [[Upper Limb]] > Intercondylar Fracture of Humerus

### [[Intercondylar Fracture]] of [[Humerus]]

#### **Overview**
An [[Intercondylar fracture]] of the [[humerus]] is a severe intra-articular injury where the fracture line extends from the distal humerus shaft into the [[elbow joint]], splitting the [[condyles]] apart,. These are often comminuted and unstable injuries, commonly referred to as **T-condylar** or **Y-condylar** fractures based on the fracture line configuration.

#### **Pathoanatomy and Mechanism of Injury**
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **Direct Trauma:** Most commonly caused by a fall on the point of the [[elbow]] with the joint in flexion. The [[olecranon process]] of the [[ulna]] acts as a wedge and is driven into the distal humerus, splitting the two humeral condyles apart,.
    *   **Indirect Trauma:** Axial loading can also contribute to this fracture pattern.
*   **Fracture Pattern:**
    *   The fracture extends vertically between the condyles and transversely across the supracondylar region, creating a "T" or "Y" shape,.
    *   The condyles often separate and rotate along their horizontal axis.
    *   In severe cases, the distal humerus is reduced to multiple fragments, described as a **"Bag of Bones"**.

#### **Classification**
Fractures are broadly classified based on the configuration and articular involvement (e.g., **Riseborough and Radin** or **OTA Classification**).
*   **Type T:** The supracondylar line is transverse, and the intercondylar line is vertical.
*   **Type Y:** The supracondylar lines are oblique, meeting the vertical intercondylar line.
*   **Comminuted:** Severe fragmentation of the articular surface.

#### **Clinical Features**
*   **Symptoms:** Severe pain, swelling, and inability to move the elbow.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Three-point bony relationship:** The relationship between the [[medial epicondyle]], [[lateral epicondyle]], and [[olecranon]] is **disturbed** (unlike in [[supracondylar fracture]] where it is maintained),.
    *   **Crepitus:** Palpable movement of bone fragments.
    *   **Deformity:** The elbow may appear widened.
    *   **Soft Tissue:** High risk of severe swelling and blistering.

#### **Investigations**
*   **X-rays:**
    *   **AP View:** Shows the separation of condyles and the T or Y pattern.
    *   **Lateral View:** Assesses the rotation and displacement of the capitellum and trochlea.
*   **CT Scan:**
    *   Invaluable for pre-operative planning.
    *   Essential to define the extent of comminution and articular step-off in complex fractures,.

#### **Management**
The primary goal is to restore articular congruity and allow early mobilization to prevent stiffness.

**1. Non-Operative Management**
*   **Indications:**
    *   Undisplaced fractures.
    *   Elderly patients with severe [[osteoporosis]].
    *   Severely comminuted fractures where reconstruction is impossible ("Bag of Bones").
    *   Patients medically unfit for surgery.
*   **Methods:**
    *   **"Bag of Bones" Technique:** The elbow is flexed (often with a collar and cuff) to allow the fragments to mold into a reasonable shape. Early gentle mobilization is encouraged as soon as pain subsides to obtain a mobile (though likely stiff) pseudoarthrosis.
    *   **Skeletal Traction:** Rarely used now; skeletal traction through the olecranon can be used for a limited period.

**2. Operative Management**
*   **Indications:** Displaced fractures in active adults to restore joint anatomy and stability.
*   **Approach:** Posterior approach (often **Campbell's approach**) is standard.
    *   **Olecranon Osteotomy:** Provides the best visualization of the articular surface. The [[olecranon]] is cut and reflected proximally with the [[triceps]] mechanism,.
    *   **Triceps Splitting/Reflecting:** Alternative methods to spare the olecranon.
*   **Fixation Techniques:**
    *   **Reduction:** The articular block is reconstructed first using K-wires or screws (converting the intercondylar fracture into a supracondylar fracture),.
    *   **Internal Fixation:** The reconstructed articular block is then fixed to the humeral shaft using **Dual Plating** (usually 90-90 plating configuration on the medial and lateral columns),.
    *   **Implants:** Reconstruction plates, locking compression plates (LCP), cannulated screws.
*   **Total Elbow Arthroplasty (Replacement):** Considered for elderly patients with unreconstructible "bag of bones" comminution to allow immediate function.

#### **Complications**
**Early:**
*   **Neurovascular Injury:**
    *   [[Ulnar nerve]] injury is common due to its proximity to the medial epicondyle and surgical handling,.
    *   [[Brachial artery]] injury (less common than in supracondylar fractures).
*   **Infection:** Risk is higher with extensive dissection and implant usage.

**Late:**
*   **Stiffness:** The most common complication. Loss of terminal extension is frequent despite good fixation,.
*   **Heterotopic Ossification / Myositis Ossificans:** Formation of bone in soft tissues, leading to restricted motion.
*   **Non-union/Malunion:** Can lead to instability or deformity (Cubitus varus/valgus).
*   **Implant Failure:** Loosening or breakage of plates/screws.

#### **Clinical Implications**
*   **"Bag of Bones":** In the elderly, a stiff but painless elbow achieved through conservative management is often functionally superior to a failed surgical fixation.
*   **Surgical Timing:** Surgery is challenging; accurate anatomical reduction of the articular surface is crucial to prevent post-traumatic [[osteoarthritis]].
