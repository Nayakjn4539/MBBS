# [[Neuro-Ophthalmology]] > Adie's Tonic Pupil and Argyll Robertson Pupil

# Adie's Tonic Pupil (Holmes-Adie Pupil)

### Etiology and Pathophysiology
*   **Lesion Site:** Damage to the **postganglionic** parasympathetic fibers,.
    *   Specific location: [[Ciliary ganglion]] or short ciliary nerves,.
*   **Cause:** Often idiopathic, but may follow a viral illness (e.g., Herpes Zoster) or trauma,.
*   **Demographics:** Most commonly affects young women (unilateral in 80% of cases),.
*   **Mechanism:** Denervation of the [[sphincter pupillae]] and [[ciliary muscle]] leads to aberrant regeneration and denervation hypersensitivity,.

### Clinical Features
*   **Pupil Appearance:**
    *   **Anisocoria:** The affected pupil is typically **dilated** (larger than the normal pupil),.
    *   **Shape:** May be slightly irregular.
*   **Reflexes:**
    *   **Light Reflex:** Absent or very sluggish/slow contraction,.
    *   **Near Reflex:** Present but **tonic** (slow, sustained contraction on near effort and slow redilation when looking at distance),,.
    *   **Light-Near Dissociation:** Present (reaction to near is stronger than to light),.
    *   **Vermiform Movements:** Segmental palsy of the iris sphincter causes worm-like contractions visible on slit-lamp examination,.
*   **Accommodation:**
    *   Accommodative paresis (slow accommodation) is common, causing asthenopia (eye strain) induced by near work,.
*   **Systemic Association:**
    *   **Holmes-Adie Syndrome:** Tonic pupil associated with diminished or absent deep tendon reflexes (knee jerks/ankle jerks),,.

### Diagnosis: Pharmacological Testing
**0.125% [[Pilocarpine]] Test** (Weak concentration):
*   **Principle:** **Denervation Hypersensitivity** (Supersensitivity),.
    *   The denervated sphincter pupillae develops an overexpression of receptors (mushrooming).
*   **Result:**
    *   **Adie's Pupil:** Constricts significantly (miosis),,.
    *   **Normal Pupil:** Does not constrict (or constricts minimally) because the concentration is too weak to affect a normally innervated sphincter,.

### Treatment
*   Usually, no treatment is required.
*   **Refractive correction:** Reading glasses to help with accommodative paresis.
*   **Cosmetic/Glare:** Dilute pilocarpine can be used to constrict the pupil if glare is bothersome.

# Argyll Robertson Pupil (ARP)

### Etiology and Pathophysiology
*   **Cause:** **[[Neurosyphilis]]** (Tertiary syphilis, Tabes Dorsalis, General Paralysis of Insane),,.
    *   Rarely caused by diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or midbrain tumors.
*   **Lesion Site:** **[[Pretectal nucleus]]** in the dorsal midbrain (periaqueductal grey matter),.
    *   The lesion affects the **intercalated neurons** connecting the pretectal nucleus to the [[Edinger-Westphal nucleus]].
    *   Dorsal aspect of the Edinger-Westphal nucleus (which contains light reflex fibers) is affected, while the ventral aspect (near reflex fibers) is spared.

### Clinical Features
*   **Laterality:** Almost always **bilateral**, but may be asymmetrical,.
*   **Pupil Appearance:**
    *   **Miosis:** Pupils are very **small** (spinal miosis),.
    *   **Irregularity:** Pupils are irregular in shape,.
*   **Reflexes:**
    *   **Light Reflex:** **Absent** (both direct and consensual),,.
    *   **Near Reflex:** **Present** and brisk (pupils constrict further on accommodation),.
    *   **Light-Near Dissociation:** Hallmark feature.
*   **Pharmacological Response:**
    *   **Poor Dilatation:** Pupils dilate poorly with mydriatics (e.g., [[Atropine]]),.

### Mnemonic
**ARP - PRA**
*   **A**ccommodation **R**eflex **P**resent
*   **P**upillary **R**eflex **A**bsent

# Comparison: Adie's Tonic Pupil vs. Argyll Robertson Pupil

| Feature | **Adie's Tonic Pupil** | **Argyll Robertson Pupil (ARP)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Site of Lesion** | **Post-ganglionic** (Ciliary ganglion / Short ciliary nerves), | **Central/Tectal** (Pretectal nucleus/Dorsal midbrain), |
| **Common Etiology** | Viral illness, Idiopathic, Trauma, | **[[Neurosyphilis]]** (Tabes Dorsalis), |
| **Laterality** | Usually **Unilateral** (80%) | Usually **Bilateral** |
| **Pupil Size** | **Dilated** (Mydriasis/Anisocoria), | **Constricted** (Miosis), |
| **Light Reflex** | Absent or Tonic (sluggish) | **Absent** |
| **Near Reflex** | **Tonic** (Slow constriction & re-dilation) | **Present** and brisk |
| **Slit Lamp Exam** | **Vermiform movements** of iris sphincter | Irregular iris, atrophy may be present |
| **Pharmacology** | Constricts with **0.125% [[Pilocarpine]]** (Denervation hypersensitivity) | Poor dilatation with **[[Atropine]]** |
| **Systemic Signs** | **Absent knee jerks** (Holmes-Adie Syndrome) | Signs of Tabes Dorsalis / Syphilis |

**Clinical Implication:**
*   **Anisocoria in the light:** If the abnormal pupil is the *larger* one (dilated), suspect **Adie's Tonic Pupil** or **CN III palsy** (distinguished by ptosis/motility deficits in CN III),.
*   **Light-Near Dissociation:** Both conditions exhibit this, but the pupil size (Large in Adie's, Small in ARP) and laterality are key differentiators.
