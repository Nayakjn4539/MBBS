# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Illustrate how the levels of prevention and modes of intervention can be applied to Poliomyelitis

### Levels of Prevention and Modes of Intervention in Poliomyelitis

The application of preventive medicine to [[Orthopaedics/Jignotes/Pediatric Orthopaedics/Poliomyelitis]] follows the natural history of the disease, moving from preventing the onset of infection to managing established disabilities.

The interventions are categorized into **Primary**, **Secondary**, and **Tertiary** levels.

---

### 1. Primary Prevention
**Goal:** Action taken prior to the onset of disease to remove the possibility that the disease will ever occur. It signifies intervention in the **pre-pathogenesis phase**,.

#### A. Health Promotion
This mode of intervention targets the general health and well-being of the host.
*   **Environmental Sanitation:** Poliovirus is transmitted via the [[faecal-oral route]] (main route in developing countries) and droplet infection,. Improving sanitation, safe water supply, and proper excreta disposal interrupts transmission.
*   **Health Education:** Educating the community about hygiene, hand washing, and the benefits of immunization.
*   **Nutrition:** Improving nutritional status to resist infection.

#### B. Specific Protection
This is the most crucial mode for Polio, aiming to intercept specific causes.
*   **Immunization:** Vaccination is the **sole effective means** of preventing poliomyelitis,.
    *   **[[Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV)]]:** Live attenuated (Sabin). It induces both humoral and intestinal (local) immunity and is useful in controlling epidemics,.
    *   **[[Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV)]]:** Killed (Salk). It is safe for immunocompromised individuals and prevents paralysis but provides less gut immunity compared to OPV,.
*   **Pulse Polio Immunization (PPI):** Sudden, simultaneous mass administration of OPV on a single day to all children 0–5 years to replace wild virus with vaccine virus in the community,.

> **Mnemonic for Vaccines:**
> *   **SaLK** = **K**illed (Injected)
> *   **SabIN** = **Li**ve (Oral - **IN**testinal immunity)

### 2. Secondary Prevention
**Goal:** Halt the progress of disease at its incipient stage and prevent complications. It applies when the disease process has already commenced (Pathogenesis phase).

#### C. Early Diagnosis and Treatment
Since there is no specific curative treatment for polio, early detection is vital for management and stopping transmission.
*   **[[Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) Surveillance]]:** Prompt reporting of any child under 15 years with sudden onset of floppiness/weakness,.
*   **Laboratory Diagnosis:** Isolation of wild poliovirus from **stool samples** (collected within 14 days of onset) is the recommended method,.
*   **Supportive Treatment:**
    *   **Rest:** Complete bed rest during the acute phase to prevent the extension of paralysis.
    *   **Pain Management:** Hot packs (warm water fomentation) and analgesics for muscle pain and spasm.
    *   **Nursing Care:** Good nursing care can minimize crippling.

> **Clinical Relevance:** **VAPP ([[Vaccine Associated Paralytic Polio]])** is a rare adverse event associated with OPV, where the attenuated virus reverts to neurovirulence. This risk is eliminated by switching to IPV,.

---

### 3. Tertiary Prevention
**Goal:** Reduce or limit impairments and disabilities, minimize suffering, and promote adjustment to irremediable conditions. This applies to the **late pathogenesis phase**.

#### D. Disability Limitation
Intervention to prevent the transition from **impairment** (loss of function) to **handicap** (social disadvantage).
*   **Physiotherapy:** Vital importance to help weakened muscles regain strength.
*   **Positioning:** Correct positioning of affected limbs to prevent contractures and deformities (e.g., using splints or sandbags).
*   **Prevention of complications:** Preventing respiratory complications in bulbar polio.

#### E. Rehabilitation
Combined use of medical, social, educational, and vocational measures.
*   **Medical Rehabilitation:** Use of orthotic devices like **callipers**, crutches, or wheelchairs to aid mobility,. Reconstructive surgery for fixed deformities (e.g., tendon transfers).
*   **Vocational/Social Rehabilitation:** Training the individual for independent living and employment to ensure they are not a burden on society.
