# Intranasal Inferior Meatal Antrostomy (INA)

**Intranasal Inferior Meatal Antrostomy** is a surgical procedure involving the creation of a window in the medial wall of the [[maxillary sinus]] through the [[inferior meatus]] to facilitate drainage and aeration. While largely superseded by [[Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery]] (FESS) and [[Middle Meatal Antrostomy]], it remains relevant for specific indications.

### Surgical Anatomy
*   **Location:** The operation targets the [[nasoantral wall]] (medial wall of the maxilla) located within the [[inferior meatus]], which lies underneath the [[inferior turbinate]],.
*   **Thinnest Point:** The bone is thinnest and easiest to pierce approximately 1.5–2.0 cm posterior to the anterior end of the inferior turbinate.
*   **Critical Relations:**
    *   **Anteriorly:** The [[nasolacrimal duct]] opens into the inferior meatus at the junction of the anterior 1/3 and posterior 2/3. Injury here causes [[epiphora]].
    *   **Posteriorly:** Branches of the [[sphenopalatine artery]].
    *   **Superiorly:** The attachment of the inferior turbinate.
    *   **Inferiorly:** The floor of the nose. Ideally, the window should be as close to the floor as possible to utilize gravity for drainage.

### Indications
Although [[Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery]] (FESS) is the treatment of choice, INA is indicated in:
*   **Chronic Suppurative Maxillary Sinusitis:** Cases refractory to medical management or antral lavage.
*   **Ciliary Dyskinesia:** Conditions like [[Kartagener's syndrome]] or [[immotile cilia syndrome]] where mucociliary clearance is defective, necessitating gravity-dependent drainage through an inferior window.
*   **Diagnostic Access:** To obtain a [[biopsy]] in suspected cases of malignancy.
*   **Access for Instrumentation:** To facilitate the removal of antral [[polyps]], cysts, or pyoceles under endoscopic guidance if not accessible via the middle meatus.

### Contraindications
*   **Irreversible Mucosal Changes:** Such as polypoidal hypertrophy (requires [[Caldwell-Luc operation]]).
*   **Osteitis:** Infection of the bone itself.
*   **Suspicion of Malignancy:** If curative resection is planned (biopsy is an exception).
*   **Children:** Generally avoided due to developing tooth buds, though less invasive than Caldwell-Luc.

### Preoperative Preparation
*   **Anesthesia:** Can be performed under [[Local Anesthesia]] (using 4% Xylocaine with adrenaline packs) or [[General Anesthesia]],.
*   **Position:** Supine with the head end raised (reclining position) and head turned slightly to the surgeon,.

### Surgical Steps
1.  **Decongestion/Anesthesia:** The [[inferior meatus]] is packed with cottonoid strips soaked in 4% Xylocaine with adrenaline (1:200,000) to decongest the area.
2.  **Turbinate Dislocation:** The [[inferior turbinate]] is fractured and elevated medially and superiorly using a large periosteal elevator (e.g., [[Freer's elevator]]) to expose the lateral wall of the inferior meatus,.
3.  **Perforation:** The nasoantral wall is perforated using a **[[Tilley's antral harpoon]]** or **[[Myle's nasoantral perforator]]**. The puncture site is generally high in the meatus at the junction of the middle and posterior thirds to avoid thick bone.
4.  **Enlargement:** The opening is enlarged using the reverse cutting edge of the Myle's perforator, **[[Kerrison's bone punch]]**, or **[[Ostrum's backward cutting forceps]]**,.
    *   The window should be approximately **1.5–2.0 cm** in diameter.
    *   The ridge must be lowered as close to the floor of the nose as possible to aid drainage.
5.  **Smoothing:** Edges are smoothed using a **[[Tilley's antral burr]]** or rasps to prevent closure and granulation.
6.  **Clearance:** Pus and debris are removed via suction.
7.  **Packing:** If significant bleeding occurs, the sinus and meatus may be packed.

### Postoperative Care
*   **Pack Removal:** Nasal packs are usually removed after 24–48 hours.
*   **Medication:** Antibiotics are administered if infection is present. Nasal decongestants are used to maintain patency.
*   **Irrigation:** Saline irrigation may be advised.

### Complications
*   **Hemorrhage:** Postoperative bleeding from the vascular mucosal edges.
*   **Nasolacrimal Duct Injury:** Occurs if the antrostomy is extended too far anteriorly, leading to [[epiphora]].
*   **Closure of Stoma:** Small openings tend to close spontaneously; adequate size (1.5–2 cm) is crucial.
*   **Synechiae:** Adhesions between the turbinate and the lateral wall.

### Clinical Comparison: INA vs. FESS
| Feature | Intranasal Antrostomy (INA) | Middle Meatal Antrostomy (FESS) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Site** | Inferior Meatus | Middle Meatus |
| **Drainage Type** | Gravity-dependent | Physiologic (Mucociliary clearance) |
| **Current Status** | Rarely done; specific indications | Treatment of choice |
| **Physiology** | Non-physiological | Physiological (follows natural pathway) |

**Mnemonic for Complications:** **"BLEED"**
*   **B**leeding
*   **L**acrimal duct injury
*   **E**arly closure (stenosis)
*   **E**piphora
*   **D**amage to teeth (rare, if floor breached deeply)
