# [[Firearms And Ballistics]] > Bullets

### **Bullets**

A **bullet** is a solid projectile discharged from a [[firearm]] (usually rifled) through the expansion of gases produced by the burning of gunpowder. It is the primary agent of injury in rifled firearm cases.

---

### **1. Composition and Structure**

The bullet is the projectile component of the **cartridge** (ammunition).

*   **Lead Bullets:** Made of lead alloyed with tin or antimony to harden it. Used in revolvers and .22 rifles (low velocity).
*   **Jacketed Bullets:** A lead core covered by a hard metal jacket (copper, nickel, brass, or cupronickel).
    *   *Purpose:* To prevent the lead from stripping inside the barrel due to high velocity and heat (Lead fouling) and to grip the **rifling** better.
    *   *Types:*
        *   **Full Metal Jacket (FMJ):** Entire bullet covered (base may be open). Common in military use.
        *   **Semi-jacketed:** Nose is exposed lead (Soft point). Expands on impact.

### **2. General Classification of Bullets**

| Type | Description & Medicolegal Significance |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Standard Bullet** | Cylindrical with a round or pointed nose (spire). Causes standard penetrating injuries. |
| **[[Dum-Dum Bullet]]** | Also called **Hollow Point** or **Soft Nose** bullet. The jacket is cut/absent at the nose.<br>**Mechanism:** Upon impact, the tip flattens and expands (mushrooms) to a diameter 2-3 times the original caliber.<br>**Effect:** Maximum transfer of kinetic energy, severe tissue destruction, large exit wounds (if any).<br>**Legal Status:** Banned in warfare (Hague Convention, 1899). Used by police/hunters for "stopping power". |
| **[[Ricochet Bullet]]** | A bullet that deflects off a hard surface (bone, wall, road) before hitting the target.<br>**Characteristics:** Deformed, flattened body.<br>**Wound:** Atypical entry wound (large, irregular, keyhole shape) because the bullet **tumbles** and hits sideways. May contain trace evidence (paint, plaster) from the intermediate target. |
| **[[Tandem Bullet]]** | Also called **Piggyback Bullet**. Occurs when the first bullet gets stuck in the barrel (misfire/defective powder), and a second shot is fired, pushing the first one out.<br>**Autopsy Finding:** Two bullets recovered from a single wound track or body cavity. The rear bullet often has the nose flattened against the base of the front bullet. |
| **[[Frangible Bullet]]** | Made of compressed metal dust, bakelite, or plastic. Designed to disintegrate into dust/fragments upon impact.<br>**Use:** Shooting galleries, Air Marshals (to prevent fuselage puncture).<br>**Injury:** Severe superficial laceration; difficult to trace ballistically. |
| **Incendiary/Explosive** | Contains a chemical charge (e.g., phosphorus) in the nose. Explodes/ignites on impact.<br>**Risk:** Dangerous to the pathologist during autopsy (can detonate). |
| **Tracer Bullet** | Base contains barium/magnesium compounds. Burns during flight to visualize trajectory (glows red/green). |
| **Souvenir Bullet** | A bullet retained in the body for a long duration (years). It becomes encapsulated by fibrous tissue.<br>**Complication:** Can cause **Lead Poisoning** ([[Plumbism]]) if synovial fluid dissolves the lead. |
| **Yawning/Tumbling** | The bullet deviates from its longitudinal axis (wobbles) or flips end-over-end.<br>**Wound:** Produces a **keyhole entry wound** (looks like a keyhole with a circular defect and a triangular tail). |

### **3. Ballistic Markings on Bullets**

When a bullet passes through a rifled barrel, the **lands** (raised ridges) bite into the bullet surface to impart spin (gyroscopic stability). This process leaves distinct marks essential for forensic identification.

#### **A. Class Characteristics (Primary Markings)**
*   Determined by the manufacturer/make of the weapon.
*   **Include:**
    *   **Caliber:** Diameter of the bullet base.
    *   **Number of Lands and Grooves:** e.g., 6 lands, 6 grooves.
    *   **Direction of Twist:** Right (clockwise) or Left (counter-clockwise).
    *   **Width:** Of the lands and grooves.
    *   *Utility:* Identifies the **type/model** of the gun (e.g., "This bullet was fired from a Webley & Scott .38 revolver").

#### **B. Individual Characteristics (Secondary Markings)**
*   Determined by the specific weapon used.
*   **Mechanism:** Microscopic irregularities (tool marks, rust, wear and tear) inside the barrel create unique scratches on the bullet as it passes through.
*   **Striations:** These parallel microscopic scratches are the "fingerprints" of the gun.
*   *Utility:* Identifies the **specific individual gun** (e.g., "This bullet was fired from *this specific* revolver recovered from the suspect").

### **4. Identification and Matching**

*   **comparison Microscope:** The "Gold Standard" instrument.
    *   Two microscopes joined by an optical bridge.
    *   The **Crime Bullet** (recovered from the body) and the **Test Bullet** (fired from the suspect weapon into a water tank or cotton wool) are viewed side-by-side.
    *   **Positive Match:** If the striations (secondary markings) line up continuously across the field of view.

### **5. Medicolegal Aspects & Autopsy Guidelines**

1.  **Rule of Hasse:** Used to estimate the caliber of the bullet from the entry wound (not very reliable due to skin elasticity).
2.  **Collection of Bullet at Autopsy:**
    *   **Never** use metal forceps/hemostats to extract the bullet (scratches damage striations).
    *   Use **rubber-tipped forceps** or fingers.
    *   If embedded in bone, cut out the block of bone containing the bullet.
3.  **Preservation:**
    *   **Do NOT wash** the bullet (preserves trace evidence like DNA, tissue, paint).
    *   Air dry if wet with blood.
    *   Wrap in soft cotton/tissue paper and place in a rigid container (plastic vial).
4.  **Marking:**
    *   The doctor should mark the bullet for chain of custody.
    *   **Site of Mark:** On the **Base** or the **Nose (Ogive)**.
    *   *Strictly Avoid:* The body surface (destroy rifling marks).
5.  **X-Rays:** Mandatory before autopsy in gunshot cases to locate the bullet, identify type (e.g., fragmented/frangible), and count projectiles.

### **Mnemonics**

*   **Handling Bullets:** **"Rubber, Base, Dry"**
    *   **R**ubber-tipped forceps.
    *   **B**ase is for marking.
    *   **D**ry before packing.

*   **Keyhole Wound:** **"Yawn Key"**
    *   **Yawn**ing or Tumbling bullets cause **Key**hole wounds.
