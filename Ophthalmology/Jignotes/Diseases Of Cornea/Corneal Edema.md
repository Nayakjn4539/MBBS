# Corneal Edema

**Corneal edema** is a clinical condition characterized by excessive hydration of the corneal tissue, leading to a loss of transparency and visual impairment. The normal cornea maintains a relative state of dehydration (deturgescence) essential for optical clarity.

### Physiology of Corneal Hydration
*   **Normal Water Content:** The cornea normally consists of **78% water**,.
*   **Maintenance of Transparency:** Transparency is maintained by a balance of factors drawing water in (swelling pressure of stromal matrix) and factors drawing water out.
*   **Key Mechanisms:**
    1.  **Barrier Function:** The [[Corneal Epithelium]] and [[Corneal Endothelium]] act as mechanical barriers to fluid.
    2.  **Active Pump Mechanism:** The **endothelium** is the most important layer for maintaining dehydration. It contains metabolic pumps (Na+/K+ ATPase and Bicarbonate-dependent ATPase) that actively transport fluid out of the stroma into the aqueous humor.
    3.  **Metabolism:** The endothelium requires oxygen and glucose. The major metabolic pathway is **aerobic**. Under hypoxic conditions (e.g., contact lens wear), **anaerobic glycolysis** occurs, leading to lactate accumulation, metabolic acidosis, and pump failure, resulting in edema,,.
*   **Critical Cell Density:** The normal endothelial cell count is ~3000 cells/mm². Corneal decompensation and edema occur when the count falls below the critical level of **500 cells/mm²**,.

### Etiology
Disruption of the limiting layers or the endothelial pump leads to edema.

| Category | Causes | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Raised IOP** | [[Acute Congestive Glaucoma]] | High [[Intraocular Pressure]] forces fluid into the cornea, overwhelming the endothelial pump,. |
| **Endothelial Damage** | **Surgical Trauma**: Cataract surgery (PBK/ABK), excessive irrigation.<br>**Dystrophies**: [[Fuchs' Endothelial Dystrophy]], [[Posterior Polymorphous Dystrophy]], [[CHED]].<br>**Inflammation**: [[Uveitis]], [[Endophthalmitis]], [[Keratitis]], Graft Rejection.<br>**Chemical Injuries**: Alkali burns. | Direct loss or dysfunction of endothelial cells leads to pump failure,. |
| **Epithelial Damage** | Mechanical abrasions, Radiation, Thermal burns. | Breach of the anterior barrier allows tear fluid entry. |
| **Hypoxia** | Contact Lens overwear. | Metabolic acidosis inhibits the endothelial pump,. |
| **Structural Breaks** | [[Acute Hydrops]] | Rupture of [[Descemet's Membrane]] in [[Keratoconus]] allows sudden aqueous influx,. |

### Clinical Features

#### Symptoms
*   **Blurred Vision:** Often worse in the morning (in endothelial dystrophies) due to lack of evaporation during sleep.
*   **Colored Halos:** Patients perceive rainbow-colored rings around lights due to the prismatic dispersion of light by fluid accumulation in the epithelial cells and corneal lamellae,,.
    *   *Differentiation:* Fincham’s test (stenopaeic slit) distinguishes glaucomatous halos (remain intact) from lenticular halos (break into segments).
*   **Pain and Photophobia:** Occurs significantly if epithelial bullae rupture, exposing nerve endings,.
*   **Redness and Lacrimation:** Non-specific signs of irritation.

#### Signs
1.  **Loss of Transparency:** The cornea appears hazy or "ground-glass" like,.
2.  **Epithelial Changes:**
    *   **Bedewing:** Steamy appearance due to fluid between cells.
    *   **Microcysts:** Tiny vesicles.
    *   **Bullae:** Large fluid-filled blisters (Bullous Keratopathy). rupture leads to pain.
3.  **Stromal Changes:**
    *   Increased corneal thickness.
    *   **Descemet’s Folds (Striate Keratopathy):** Delicate grey lines/wrinkles in Descemet's membrane seen often after cataract surgery.
4.  **Specific Signs:**
    *   **Haab's Striae:** Horizontal (or concentric to limbus) tears in Descemet's membrane seen in [[Congenital Glaucoma]]/Buphthalmos,.
    *   **Vogt's Striae:** Vertical stress lines in the deep stroma seen in [[Keratoconus]].

### Specific Clinical Entities

#### 1. Bullous Keratopathy (Pseudophakic/Aphakic)
*   **Definition:** Permanent corneal edema characterized by the formation of epithelial bullae following cataract surgery (Aphakic or Pseudophakic Bullous Keratopathy - ABK/PBK).
*   **Cause:** Surgical trauma to the endothelium, especially if the pre-operative cell count was low or during complicated surgeries.
*   **Clinical Picture:** Painful rupture of bullae, hazy vision, vascularization (pannus) in late stages.

#### 2. Fuchs' Endothelial Dystrophy
*   **Pathology:** Progressive loss of endothelial cells and formation of **Cornea Guttata** (wart-like excrescences on Descemet's membrane).
*   **Course:**
    1.  Stage of Cornea Guttata (Asymptomatic).
    2.  Edematous Stage (Morning blurring).
    3.  Stage of Bullous Keratopathy (Painful).
    4.  Stage of Scarring.

#### 3. Acute Hydrops
*   **Definition:** Sudden onset of severe corneal edema in ectatic conditions like [[Keratoconus]].
*   **Mechanism:** Acute tear of [[Descemet's Membrane]] allows aqueous to flood the stroma.
*   **Healing:** Usually heals with a scar in 6–10 weeks.

### Diagnosis and Investigations

*   **Slit Lamp Biomicroscopy:**
    *   **Sclerotic Scatter:** Highlights stromal haze.
    *   **Retroillumination:** Visualizes vacuoles and cysts.
*   **Pachymetry:**
    *   Measures **Corneal Thickness (CT)**.
    *   Normal CT: **0.52–0.54 mm (540 microns)**.
    *   CT increases significantly in edema.
*   **Specular Microscopy:**
    *   Non-invasive imaging of the [[Corneal Endothelium]].
    *   Assesses **Cell Density** (cells/mm²) and **Morphology** (Polymegathism/Pleomorphism),.
*   **Esthesiometer:** To test corneal sensation (reduced in chronic edema).

### Management

#### Medical Management
Aim: To dehydrate the cornea and reduce intraocular pressure.
1.  **Hypertonic Agents:** **5% Sodium Chloride** drops or **6% Ointment** creating an osmotic gradient to draw fluid out of the cornea,,.
2.  **Dehydration via Evaporation:** Blowing warm air (hair dryer) on the eyes in the morning to increase evaporation,.
3.  **Lowering IOP:** Beta-blockers (e.g., Timolol) or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors to reduce hydraulic pressure on the endothelium,.
4.  **Bandage Contact Lens (BCL):** Hydrophilic soft contact lenses relieve pain by covering ruptured bullae and protecting exposed nerve endings,.

#### Surgical Management
Indicated when vision is severely compromised or for intractable pain.
1.  **Keratoplasty (Corneal Transplantation):**
    *   **Penetrating Keratoplasty (PK):** Full-thickness replacement.
    *   **Endothelial Keratoplasty (DSEK/DSAEK/DMEK):** Selective replacement of the diseased endothelium. Preferred for endothelial dysfunction (Fuchs', PBK) due to faster recovery and tectonic integrity,,.
2.  **Anterior Stromal Puncture:** To induce scarring and adhesion of epithelium in recurrent erosions/bullae.
3.  **Conjunctival Flap (Gundersen):** For painful blind eyes with bullous keratopathy to relieve pain.
4.  **Phototherapeutic Keratectomy (PTK):** Using excimer laser to smooth surface irregularities.

### Clinical Implications
**Effect on Tonometry:**
*   **False Readings:** Corneal edema and thickness affect IOP measurement.
    *   **Thick Cornea (Edema):** May give a **false high** reading due to increased resistance, though epithelial edema can sometimes cause a false low due to sponginess.
    *   **Rule of Thumb:** 1 mmHg change in measured IOP for every 10 microns deviation from normal corneal thickness.
    *   **Action:** Always check corneal thickness ([[Pachymetry]]) in glaucoma suspects or when IOP does not match the clinical picture.

**Differential Diagnosis for Neonatal Cloudy Cornea:**
[[Mnemonic]]: **STUMPED**,.
*   **S:** [[Sclerocornea]]
*   **T:** Tears in [[Descemet's Membrane]] (Trauma/Glaucoma)
*   **U:** [[Ulcer]]
*   **M:** Metabolic ([[Mucopolysaccharidosis]])
*   **P:** [[Peter's Anomaly]]
*   **E:** Endothelial Dystrophy ([[CHED]])
*   **D:** [[Dermoid]]
