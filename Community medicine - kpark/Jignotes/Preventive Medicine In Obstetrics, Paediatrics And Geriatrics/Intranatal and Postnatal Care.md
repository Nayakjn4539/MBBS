# [[Preventive Medicine In Obstetrics, Paediatrics And Geriatrics]] > Intranatal and Postnatal Care

### Intranatal Care (Care During Delivery)

**Goal:** To ensure a "Clean and Safe" delivery to minimize maternal and neonatal mortality (prevention of [[Sepsis]] and [[Tetanus Neonatorum]]).

#### 1. Aims of Intranatal Care
*   Thorough asepsis (prevention of infection).
*   Delivery with minimum injury to the infant and mother.
*   Readiness to deal with complications (e.g., prolonged labor, [[Antepartum Hemorrhage]], convulsions).
*   Care of the baby at delivery (Resuscitation, cord care).

#### 2. The "Cleans" of Delivery
Crucial for the prevention of [[Neonatal Tetanus]].

*   **The 5 Cleans (Standard):**
    1.  Clean **Hands** (of the attendant).
    2.  Clean **Surface** (for delivery).
    3.  Clean **Blade** (for cutting cord).
    4.  Clean **Cord Tie**.
    5.  Clean **Cord Stump** (No application of cow dung/oils).
*   **The 7 Cleans (Proposed under RCH-II):**
    *   Includes the 5 cleans above +
    *   Clean **Water** (for washing hands).
    *   Clean **Towel** (for drying hands/baby).

#### 3. Types of Care
**A. Domiciliary Care (Home Delivery):**
*   **Indication:** Mothers with normal obstetric history and satisfactory home conditions.
*   **Provider:** [[ANM]] (Auxiliary Nurse Midwife), [[LHV]] (Lady Health Visitor), or Trained [[Dai]].
*   **Advantages:** Familiar surroundings reduce fear; mother can supervise household; cross-infection risk is generally lower than in overcrowded hospitals.
*   **Disadvantages:** Lack of immediate medical supervision for emergencies; less rest for the mother.
*   **"Danger Signals" during Labor (Need immediate referral):**
    *   Sluggish pains or no pains after membrane rupture.
    *   Good pains for 1 hour but no progress.
    *   Prolapse of cord or hand.
    *   Meconium-stained liquor.
    *   Excessive bleeding or collapse.
    *   Placenta not separated within 30 minutes.

**B. Institutional Care:**
*   **Indication:** [[High Risk Pregnancy]] (e.g., elderly primi, malpresentation, anaemia, previous LSCS) or unsuitable home conditions.
*   **Trend:** Promoting 100% institutional delivery through schemes like [[Janani Suraksha Yojana]] (JSY).
*   **Rooming-in:** Keeping the baby’s crib beside the mother’s bed to promote bonding and [[Breastfeeding]].

### Postnatal Care (Care of Mother and Newborn)

**Definition:** Care of the mother and newborn after delivery (puerperium), usually lasting **6 weeks**.

#### 1. Objectives
*   Prevent complications (Puerperal sepsis, haemorrhage).
*   Restore mother to optimum health (Nutrition, Anaemia correction).
*   Establish successful [[Breastfeeding]].
*   Provide [[Family Planning]] services.

#### 2. Care of the Mother
*   **Postnatal Visits (Recommended minimum 3-4 visits):**
    *   **1st visit:** Within 24 hours (Day 1).
    *   **2nd visit:** Day 3.
    *   **3rd visit:** Day 7.
    *   **4th visit:** Day 42 (6 weeks).
    *   *(Note: Under [[Home Based Newborn Care]], ASHA visits on Days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42 for institutional deliveries).*
*   **Assessment:** Check vital signs, involution of uterus, lochia, breast condition, and perineum.
*   **Complications to Watch:**
    *   **[[Puerperal Sepsis]]:** Infection of the genital tract within 3 weeks of delivery.
    *   **Secondary Haemorrhage:** Bleeding after 24 hours up to 6 weeks.
    *   **Thrombophlebitis** and Mastitis.
*   **Restoration of Health:**
    *   **Nutrition:** Additional **+600 kcal/day** during first 6 months of lactation.
    *   **Supplements:** [[Iron and Folic Acid]] (IFA) to be continued for 180 days (6 months) postpartum.
    *   **Exercises:** To restore abdominal and pelvic muscle tone.
*   **Family Planning:**
    *   Ideal time for **Postpartum Sterilization** (Tubectomy): 24-48 hours after delivery.
    *   **[[PPIUCD]]** (Postpartum Intrauterine Contraceptive Device): Inserted immediately or within 48 hours.
    *   **Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM):** Effective up to 6 months if exclusively breastfeeding.

#### 3. Care of the Newborn (Neonatal Care)
The first 24 hours are critical.

**A. Immediate Care:**
1.  **Clear Airway:** Mucus extraction if necessary; position head low.
2.  **[[APGAR Score]]:** Assessed at 1 minute and 5 minutes.
    *   **Score 7-10:** Normal.
    *   **Score 4-6:** Mild depression.
    *   **Score 0-3:** Severe depression (Immediate resuscitation needed).
3.  **Cord Care:** Cut when pulsation ceases. Keep dry and clean.
4.  **Eye Care:** Clean eyes with sterile swab (inner to outer canthus). No kajal.
5.  **Thermal Protection:** Prevent **[[Hypothermia]]**. Dry baby immediately, wrap in warm cloth, skin-to-skin contact.
    *   **Warm Chain:** A system to maintain the temperature of the newborn at every step.

**B. Essential Newborn Care (The "SANE" Mnemonic for [[Kangaroo Mother Care]]):**
Useful for [[Low Birth Weight]] (<2.5 kg) babies.
*   **S** - **Skin-to-skin** contact (Thermal control).
*   **A** - **Ambulatory** (Mother can walk while carrying baby).
*   **N** - **Nutrition** (Exclusive breastfeeding).
*   **E** - **Emotional** bonding.

**C. Feeding:**
*   Initiate **[[Breastfeeding]]** within **1 hour** of normal delivery (4 hours for LSCS).
*   Feed **[[Colostrum]]** (rich in antibodies, 'first immunization').
*   **Exclusive Breastfeeding** for 6 months (no water, no honey, no ghutti).

**D. Immunization (At Birth):**
*   **[[BCG]]**: Intradermal, Left Upper Arm.
*   **[[OPV]]-0 dose**: Oral.
*   **[[Hepatitis B]]**: Intramuscular (within 24 hours).

**E. Danger Signs in Newborn (Refer immediately):**
*   Not feeding well.
*   Convulsions.
*   Respiratory rate >60/min.
*   Severe chest indrawing.
*   Temperature >37.5°C or <35.5°C.

**F. Neonatal Screening:**
*   Ideally screen for **[[Congenital Hypothyroidism]]** (TSH levels), **[[Phenylketonuria]]**, and **Sickle cell anaemia**.
