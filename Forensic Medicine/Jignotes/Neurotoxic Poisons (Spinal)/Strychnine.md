# [[Neurotoxic Poisons (Spinal)]] > Strychnine

# Strychnine (Nux Vomica)

### **General Considerations**
*   **Source:** Seeds of the tree *[[Strychnos nux-vomica]]* (Family: Loganiaceae). Also known as **Kuchila**, Poison nut, Dog button, or Quaker button.
*   **Active Principles:**
    1.  **[[Strychnine]]** (Principal alkaloid, highly toxic).
    2.  **Brucine** (Less toxic, about 1/10th to 1/20th potency of strychnine).
    3.  Loganin (Glycoside).
*   **Toxic Part:** All parts of the tree are toxic (bark, leaves, wood), but seeds are the most common source of poisoning.

### **Physical Characteristics of Seeds (Important Spotter)**
*   **Shape:** Flat, circular discs (button-shaped).
*   **Dimensions:** ~2.5 cm diameter, 6 mm thick.
*   **Contour:** Concave on one side, convex on the other (umbilicated).
*   **Surface:** Ash-grey or light brown, covered with fine, silky, radiating hairs giving a **satin-like sheen**.
*   **Texture:** Very hard pericarp (tough to pulverize).
*   **Taste:** Intensely bitter (one of the most bitter substances known).
*   **Note:** Uncrushed seeds are usually non-poisonous as the hard pericarp prevents absorption in the GIT; they are passed out in feces. **Crushed seeds are lethal.**

### **Mechanism of Action**
*   Strychnine is a **[[Spinal Poison]]**.
*   It acts as a **competitive antagonist of [[Glycine]]** (an inhibitory neurotransmitter) at the post-synaptic receptors in the **[[Anterior Horn Cells]]** of the spinal cord.
*   This blockage of inhibitory signals leads to a "release phenomenon," causing unchecked, widespread reflex excitability.
*   Result: Excessive stimulation of motor nerves resulting in powerful muscle contractions (convulsions) in response to minimal sensory stimuli.

---

### **Clinical Features (Signs and Symptoms)**
Symptoms appear rapidly (15–30 minutes after ingestion).

**1. Prodromal Symptoms:**
*   Bitter taste in the mouth.
*   Restlessness, anxiety, and fear.
*   Stiffness of neck and face muscles.
*   Sense of impending doom.

**2. Convulsive Stage:**
*   **Precipitating Factors:** Slightest stimuli (noise, light, touch, or current of air) trigger violent convulsions (**Reflex Convulsions**).
*   **Nature of Convulsions:** Initially clonic, becoming tonic. Affects all muscles simultaneously.
*   **[[Risus Sardonicus]] (Devilish Smile):** Spasm of facial muscles (zygomaticus) causes retraction of the angle of the mouth and knitting of eyebrows.
*   **Consciousness:** **Crucial Point:** The patient remains **fully conscious** and mentally clear throughout the episodes and feels intense pain (unless death is imminent due to hypoxia).

**3. Postures (Due to muscle spasm):**
*   **[[Opisthotonos]]:** Body arched backward, resting on head and heels (Most common, due to stronger antigravity extensor muscles).
*   **Emprosthotonos:** Body curled forward.
*   **Pleurosthotonos:** Body bent sideways.

**4. Respiration:**
*   Breathing stops during convulsions due to spasm of thoracic and abdominal muscles.
*   Cyanosis and bulging eyes occur.

**5. Interval between convulsions:**
*   Muscles are **completely relaxed** between spasms.
*   This distinguishes it from Tetanus.

### **Diagnosis: Strychnine vs Tetanus**
This is a classic exam differentiation.

| Feature | Strychnine Poisoning | Tetanus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **History** | Ingestion of poison/seeds. | Injury/wound (Clostridium tetani entry). |
| **Onset** | Sudden. | Gradual. |
| **Muscle Tone** | Muscles are **relaxed** between convulsions. | Muscles remain **rigid** between convulsions. |
| **Jaw Involvement** | Jaw muscles affected **late** (after limbs). | Jaw muscles affected **first** ([[Lockjaw]]/Trismus). |
| **Progression** | Rapid course (death/recovery in hours). | Slow course (days). |
| **Chemical Analysis**| Positive for Strychnine. | Negative. |

**Mnemonic:** 
*   **T**etanus is **T**ight (Rigid always).
*   **S**trychnine is **S**oft (Relaxed in between).

### **Fatal Dose and Fatal Period**
*   **Fatal Dose:**
    *   Strychnine alkaloid: **15–50 mg**.
    *   Seeds: **1 crushed seed**.
*   **Fatal Period:** **1–2 hours**. Death is usually due to asphyxia (paralysis of respiratory muscles) or medullary paralysis.

---

### **Treatment**
**1. Stabilization:**
*   **Isolate the patient:** Keep in a **dark, quiet room** to minimize sensory stimuli (noise/light) that trigger convulsions.
*   Protect airway and provide oxygen.

**2. Control of Convulsions (Priority #1):**
*   **Sedatives:** IV [[Diazepam]] (0.1–0.5 mg/kg) or Barbiturates (Sodium Pentothal/Amytal).
*   **Muscle Relaxants:** If seizures are uncontrolled, neuromuscular blockers (e.g., Succinylcholine, Gallamine) with mechanical ventilation may be required.
*   **Anesthesia:** General anesthesia (Ether/Chloroform) may be needed in severe cases.

**3. Decontamination:**
*   **Gastric Lavage:** **Contraindicated** during convulsions (risk of aspiration or precipitating violent seizures). Only perform *after* seizures are controlled and airway is secured.
*   Use **Potassium Permanganate (1:5000)** to oxidize the alkaloid.
*   Use **[[Activated Charcoal]]** to adsorb the poison.
*   Tannic acid/strong tea can precipitate the alkaloid.

**4. Acidification of Urine:** To enhance excretion (controversial/supportive).

### **Autopsy Findings**
*   **External:**
    *   **[[Rigor Mortis]]:** Appears early and disappears early (due to muscle exhaustion).
    *   **[[Postmortem Caloricity]]:** Rise in body temperature after death (due to increased muscle activity).
    *   **Signs of Asphyxia:** Cyanosis, petechiae, congested face.
    *   Hands may be clenched; feet incurved.
*   **Internal:**
    *   **Extravasation of blood** in muscles (due to violent contractions).
    *   Congestion of trachea, lungs, brain, and spinal cord.
    *   Seeds may be found in the stomach (mucosa may show patchy ecchymosis).

**Forensic Science Lab Detection:**
*   **Biological Test:** Injecting serum/urine into the dorsal lymph sac of a **frog** causes convulsions.

### **Medicolegal Aspects**
*   **Homicide:** Rare due to extremely bitter taste (difficult to mask) and dramatic symptoms.
*   **Suicide:** Rare because death is extremely painful and terrifying.
*   **Accidental:** Most common.
    *   Children eating seeds.
    *   Overdose of indigenous medicines/aphrodisiacs containing Nux vomica.
*   **Cattle Poisoning:** Common agent for killing cattle.
*   **Arrow Poison:** Historically used.
*   **Resistance to Putrefaction:** Strychnine resists decomposition and can be detected in exhumed bodies years later.
