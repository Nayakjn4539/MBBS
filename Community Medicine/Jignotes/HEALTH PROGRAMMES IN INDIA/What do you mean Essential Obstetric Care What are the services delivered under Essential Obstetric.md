# [[HEALTH PROGRAMMES IN INDIA]] > What do you mean Essential Obstetric Care? What are the services delivered under Essential Obstetric Care according to RCH II programme? What is the importance of Maternal Death review?

### Essential Obstetric Care (EOC)

**Meaning and Concept:**
[[Essential Obstetric Care]] intends to provide basic maternity services to **all** pregnant women. The core philosophy is based on the realization that complications associated with pregnancy are not always predictable; hence, every pregnant woman is considered "at risk."

It aims to ensure that every woman has access to skilled care during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period to prevent maternal morbidity and mortality.

### Services Delivered Under Essential Obstetric Care (RCH II)

Under the [[Reproductive and Child Health Programme Phase II]] (RCH II), the services are broadly categorized into Antenatal, Intranatal, Postnatal, and Emergency care.

#### 1. Antenatal Care (ANC)
*   **Early Registration:** Ideally within the **first trimester** (before 12 weeks) of pregnancy.
*   **Minimum Check-ups:** Provision of at least **3 (now 4)** antenatal check-ups by an ANM or Medical Officer.
*   **Screening:** Detection of risk factors (e.g., anemia, pre-eclampsia) and appropriate referral.
*   **Prophylaxis:**
    *   **Tetanus:** 2 doses of [[Tetanus Toxoid]] (TT) immunization.
    *   **Anemia:** Administration of **Iron and Folic Acid (IFA)** tablets (100 mg elemental iron + 500 mcg folic acid) for at least 100 days.

#### 2. Intranatal Care (Delivery Services)
*   **Institutional Delivery:** Promoting delivery in health institutions.
    *   **24x7 Services:** 50% of Primary Health Centres ([[PHCs]]) and all Community Health Centres ([[CHCs]]) are operationalized as 24-hour delivery centers.
*   **Skilled Birth Attendance:** Ensuring every birth is attended by a **Skilled Birth Attendant (SBA)** (doctor, nurse, or ANM) to manage normal deliveries and identify complications early.
*   **Home Deliveries:** For unavoidable home deliveries, ensuring the **"5 Cleans"** are followed.

> **Mnemonic for 5 Cleans: SH-3C**
> *   Clean **S**urface
> *   Clean **H**ands
> *   Clean **C**ord cut (blade)
> *   Clean **C**ord tie
> *   Clean **C**ord stump (no applicant)

#### 3. Postnatal Care (PNC)
*   Provision of at least **3 postnatal check-ups** to monitor recovery and detect complications (e.g., Puerperal Sepsis, Secondary Hemorrhage).
*   Counseling on diet, hygiene, contraception, and essential newborn care.

#### 4. Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC)
RCH II emphasizes the **"First Referral Unit" ([[FRU]])**. An existing facility (usually a CHC or Sub-district hospital) is upgraded to an FRU if it provides 24-hour services for:
*   Emergency Obstetric Care including **Surgical Interventions** (Caesarean Section).
*   **Newborn Care**.
*   **Blood Storage Facility**.

**New Initiatives under RCH II for EmOC:**
*   **Anesthesia Training:** Training MBBS doctors in **Life Saving Anesthetic Skills (LSAS)** to overcome the shortage of anesthetists at FRUs.
*   **Obstetric Management:** Training MBBS doctors in basic obstetric management skills.

| Level of Care | Facility Type | Services Provided |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **BEmOC** (Basic) | 24x7 PHCs | Normal delivery, Antibiotics, Uterotonics, Newborn resuscitation, Manual removal of placenta. |
| **CEmOC** (Comprehensive) | FRUs / District Hospitals | All BEmOC services **+** Caesarean Section **+** Blood Transfusion. |

### Importance of Maternal Death Review (MDR)

[[Maternal Death Review]] is a strategy to improve the quality of obstetric care and reduce maternal mortality and morbidity. It is not merely a statistical exercise but a qualitative analysis.

**Key Importance:**
1.  **Identification of Gaps:** It helps identify the specific **medical causes** (e.g., hemorrhage, sepsis) and **non-medical factors** (social, logistical) leading to death.
2.  **The "Three Delays" Model:** MDR helps analyze the death based on the three delays:
    *   **Delay 1:** Deciding to seek care (Socio-economic/cultural factors).
    *   **Delay 2:** Reaching the health facility (Transport/Roads).
    *   **Delay 3:** Receiving adequate treatment at the facility (Staff/Drugs/Equipment shortage).
3.  **Corrective Action:** It provides evidence to policy-makers and administrators to take corrective actions at the facility or community level to prevent recurrence.
4.  **Accountability:** It enforces accountability within the health system regarding the management of obstetric emergencies.

**Types of MDR:**
*   **Facility-Based MDR:** Auditing deaths occurring within the hospital.
*   **Community-Based MDR:** Investigation of deaths occurring at home or in transit by health workers (Verbal Autopsy).

> **Clinical Relevance:** The philosophy behind MDR is **"Beyond the Numbers."** Every maternal death has a story to tell and something to teach us so that other mothers can be saved.
