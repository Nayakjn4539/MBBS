# [[ENVIRONMENT & HEALTH]] > Bacteriological Surveillance of water quality

### **Bacteriological Surveillance of Water Quality**

**Bacteriological surveillance** is a critical component of public health to ensure the safety of drinking water. Since it is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to test for every specific pathogen (e.g., *Salmonella typhi*, *Vibrio cholerae*), surveillance relies on the detection of **[[indicator organisms]]**.

### **1. Bacteriological Indicators of Water Quality**

These organisms indicate faecal pollution. If they are present, it is assumed that pathogens may also be present.

| **Indicator Organism** | **Significance** | **Key Features** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. [[Coliform organisms]]** (e.g., *E. coli*) | **Primary Indicator** | • Constantly present in human intestine (billions excreted daily).<br>• Easily detected (1 in 100ml).<br>• Survives longer than pathogens.<br>• greater resistance to natural purification forces. |
| **2. [[Faecal Streptococci]]** | **Recent** Pollution | • Regularly found in faeces but in smaller numbers.<br>• *Confirmatory evidence* of recent pollution. |
| **3. [[Clostridium perfringens]]** | **Remote** (Old) Pollution | • Spores survive for a long time in water.<br>• Resists chlorination.<br>• Presence suggests contamination occurred at a remote time or a lapse in filtration. |

### **2. Collection of Water Samples (Sampling)**

Strict aseptic techniques must be followed to avoid accidental contamination.

*   **Bottle:** Clean, sterilized glass bottles (200-250 ml) with a ground glass stopper.
*   **Protection:** The stopper and neck should be protected by a paper cover.
*   **[[Sodium Thiosulphate]]:** If the water is chlorinated, **0.1 ml of 3% sodium thiosulphate** must be added to the bottle *before* sterilization.
    *   *Function:* It neutralizes residual chlorine to prevent it from killing bacteria during transport.
*   **Transport:** Keep in ice; analyze within **48 hours** of collection.

### **3. Methods of Bacteriological Examination**

#### **A. Presumptive Coliform Test (Multiple Tube Method)**
*   **Objective:** To estimate the **[[Most Probable Number (MPN)]]** of coliform organisms in 100 ml of water.
*   **Method:** Inoculate water samples into tubes containing **[[McConkey's Lactose Bile Salt Broth]]**.
*   **Indicator:** Bromocresol purple.
*   **Incubation:** 37°C for 48 hours.
*   **Positive Result:** Production of **Acid and Gas**.
*   **Interpretation:** MPN is calculated from statistical tables based on the number of positive tubes.

#### **B. Confirmatory Tests**
If the presumptive test is positive, confirmation is required to differentiate faecal *E. coli* from non-faecal coliforms.
1.  **Subculture:** Into **Brilliant Green Bile Broth**.
2.  **[[Eijkman Test]]:**
    *   Incubate at **44°C**: *E. coli* (faecal) produces gas.
    *   Incubate at **37°C**: Other coliforms grow.
3.  **Indole Test:** *E. coli* produces indole at 44°C.

#### **C. Membrane Filtration Technique**
*   Sample is filtered through a **cellulose ester membrane**. Bacteria are retained on the surface.
*   Membrane is placed on a culture medium.
*   **Advantage:** Results are available in **20 hours** (faster than MPN).

#### **D. Colony Count**
*   Colonies counted on nutrient agar plates incubated at 37°C and 22°C.
*   **Significance:** Provides an estimate of general bacterial purity. A sudden increase in colony count indicates contamination.

### **4. WHO Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality**

The following bacteriological standards are recommended:

| **Water Source** | **Guideline Value (Standard)** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **All water intended for drinking** | **[[E. coli]] or thermotolerant coliform bacteria must NOT be detectable in any 100 ml sample.** |
| **Treated water entering distribution system** | **E. coli or thermotolerant coliform bacteria must NOT be detectable in any 100 ml sample.** |
| **Treated water in distribution system** | • E. coli or thermotolerant coliforms: **0 per 100 ml**.<br>• Total coliforms: Must not be detectable in 95% of samples over a 12-month period. |

### **5. Interpretation of Results**

*   **0 Coliforms/100ml:** Excellent/Safe.
*   **1-3 Coliforms/100ml:** Satisfactory (re-test).
*   **4-10 Coliforms/100ml:** Suspicious (investigate).
*   **>10 Coliforms/100ml:** Unsatisfactory (Stop supply and treat).
*   **Presence of *E. coli*:** Indicates **Fecal Contamination** (Dangerous).

### **Mnemonic for Indicators**

**"S-R, C-O"** (Like a Senior Resident and Co-worker)
*   **S**treptococci = **R**ecent pollution.
*   **C**lostridium = **O**ld (Remote) pollution.

### **Clinical Relevance**
Failure in bacteriological surveillance can lead to outbreaks of:
*   **Viral:** [[Hepatitis A]], [[Hepatitis E]], Poliomyelitis.
*   **Bacterial:** [[Cholera]], [[Typhoid fever]], Bacillary Dysentery.
*   **Protozoal:** Amoebiasis, Giardiasis.
