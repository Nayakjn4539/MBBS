# [[DISASTER MANAGEMENT]] > What do you mean by 'Disaster'? What are common causes of disaster? As a BMOH of a cyclone prone block how will you proceed for preparedness to tackle the impending disaster in your block?

### Definition of Disaster

The term **Disaster** is derived from a French word meaning "Bad Star".

**Standard Definition (UNISDR/WHO):**
A disaster is defined as a serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society involving widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses and impacts, which **exceed the ability** of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources.

**Definition by Colin Grant:**
A disaster is a catastrophe causing injury or illness simultaneously to at least **30 people**, who will require hospital emergency treatment.

**Equation of Disaster:**
$$ \text{Disaster} = \text{Hazard} \times \text{Vulnerability} $$
*(Or Hazard + Vulnerability / Capacity)*

### Common Causes of Disaster

Disasters are broadly classified based on their origin into Natural and Man-made (Human-induced).

**1. Natural Disasters**
*   **Geophysical:** [[Earthquakes]], [[Tsunamis]], Volcanic eruptions, Landslides.
*   **Meteorological:** [[Cyclones]], Hurricanes, Tornadoes, Storms.
*   **Hydrological:** [[Floods]] (Flash floods), Avalanches.
*   **Climatological:** [[Drought]], Heat waves, Cold waves, Forest wildfires.
*   **Biological:** Epidemics (e.g., [[COVID-19]], Cholera), Insect infestations (Locusts).

**2. Man-Made (Human-Induced) Disasters**
*   **Technological:** Industrial accidents (e.g., [[Bhopal Gas Tragedy]]), Nuclear explosions (e.g., Chernobyl), Chemical spills.
*   **Transport Accidents:** Major road, rail, air, or sea accidents.
*   **Social/Political:** War, terrorism, riots, civil unrest, stampedes.
*   **Complex Emergencies:** Displaced populations (Refugees).

> **Mnemonic for Causes:** **"N-H-M"**
> *   **N**atural (Earthquake, Flood)
> *   **H**uman-made (War, Pollution)
> *   **M**eteorological (Cyclone, Drought)

### Preparedness Plan as a BMOH for an Impending Cyclone

As the **Block Medical Officer of Health (BMOH)**, the primary objective during the **Warning Phase** (impending disaster) is to mobilize resources to minimize loss of life and prevent disease outbreaks. The plan of action includes:

#### 1. Coordination and Communication (Command Post)
*   **Control Room:** Activate a 24x7 [[Disaster Control Room]] at the Block Primary Health Centre (BPHC).
*   **Inter-sectoral Coordination:** Establish direct communication links with the Block Development Officer (BDO), Police, and District administration.
*   **Warning Dissemination:** Ensure cyclone warnings reach the remotest sub-centers using ASHAs and Anganwadi workers.

#### 2. Resource Mobilization (Logistics)
*   **Buffer Stock:** Ensure adequate stock of essential medicines.
    *   **Essential Drugs:** IV fluids (Ringer Lactate, Normal Saline), [[ORS]] packets, Antibiotics, Paracetamol, Anti-snake venom (ASV), Tetanus Toxoid.
    *   **Disinfectants:** [[Bleaching powder]], Chlorine tablets (Halogen tablets) for water purification.
    *   **Dressings:** Cotton, bandages, splints for trauma care.
*   **Ambulance Services:** Ensure 108/102 ambulances are fueled and stationed at strategic points.

#### 3. Manpower Management
*   **Rapid Response Team (RRT):** Formulate a medical team consisting of doctors, nurses, and pharmacists ready for deployment.
*   **Duty Roster:** Cancel all leaves; implement round-the-clock duty rosters for medical and paramedical staff.
*   **Training:** Brief staff on [[Triage]] protocols and mass casualty management.

#### 4. Protection of Vulnerable Groups
*   **Evacuation:** Coordinate with the administration to evacuate people from low-lying areas to **Cyclone Shelters**.
*   **High-Risk Pregnancy:** Identify pregnant women with Expected Date of Delivery (EDD) within the next 2-3 weeks and shift them to the BPHC or District Hospital beforehand to ensure safe delivery.
*   **Children and Elderly:** Prioritize their evacuation and nutritional needs.

#### 5. Infrastructure Safety
*   **Hospital Safety:** Ensure the BPHC building is secure (close windows/doors). Check backup power generators and fuel supply.
*   **Water Source Protection:** Cover tube wells and protect water sources from contamination by floodwaters.

#### 6. Public Health Measures
*   **Health Education:** Instruct the community through loudspeakers/ASHAs:
    *   To drink only boiled or chlorinated water.
    *   To keep a survival kit (dry food, water, torch, medicines).
    *   To avoid going outdoors during the cyclone.
*   **Vector Control:** Pre-position insecticides (DDT/Malathion) to prevent post-cyclone vector-borne disease outbreaks (Malaria/Dengue).

**Clinical Relevance:**
The most common disease reported in the post-disaster phase of a cyclone/flood is **Gastroenteritis**. Therefore, the foremost step for disease prevention is the **Chlorination of water** (maintaining residual chlorine > 0.7 mg/L).
