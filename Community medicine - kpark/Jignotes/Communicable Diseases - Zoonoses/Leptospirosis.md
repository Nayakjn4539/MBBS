# Leptospirosis (Weil’s Disease)

Leptospirosis is a widespread [[anthropozoonosis]] (disease transmitted from animals to man) caused by spirochetes. It is particularly prevalent in warm, humid tropical countries and is strongly linked to heavy rainfall, flooding, and occupational exposure.

### 1. Epidemiological Determinants

**A. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** **[[Leptospira interrogans]]** (pathogenic species).
    *   These are thin, light, motile **spirochetes** with hooked ends.
    *   There are many serovars; *L. icterohaemorrhagiae* is a common severe serovar.
*   **Survival:** They can survive for weeks in **alkaline soil**, **fresh water**, and damp environments. They are sensitive to acid, drying, and heat.

**B. Reservoir and Source**
*   **Natural/Maintenance Hosts:** **[[Rodents]]** (especially rats and mice) are the most important reservoirs. They act as *carriers* for their entire life without getting sick.
*   **Other Hosts:** Cattle, dogs, pigs, and sheep can also be infected.
*   **Source of Infection:** The **urine** of infected animals (carrier hosts). The spirochetes establish themselves in the renal tubules of these animals and are excreted in urine, contaminating the environment.

**C. Environmental Factors**
*   **Occupation:** "Hazardous occupation" disease. Affects agricultural farmers (rice fields), sewer workers, miners, fishermen, and veterinarians.
*   **Climate:** Outbreaks are frequently associated with **heavy rainfall**, **floods**, and water-logging (e.g., during monsoons).

### 2. Transmission

*   **Mode of Transmission:**
    1.  **Indirect Contact (Most Common):** Contact of broken skin (cuts, abrasions) or mucous membranes with **soil, water, or vegetation contaminated by the urine** of infected animals.
    2.  **Direct Contact:** Direct handling of infected urine or tissues (e.g., slaughterhouse workers).
    3.  **Ingestion:** Swallowing contaminated food or water.
    4.  **Droplet Infection:** Inhalation of aerosols (rare, e.g., in dairy barns).
*   **Portal of Entry:** Skin abrasions, conjunctiva, nose, and mouth.
*   **Human-to-Human Transmission:** Extremely rare. Humans are generally "dead-end" hosts.

### 3. Incubation Period
*   **Usually 10 days** (Range: 4 to 20 days).

### 4. Clinical Picture

The disease manifests in two phases (biphasic illness). Many infections are subclinical.

**A. Anicteric Leptospirosis (Mild Form)**
*   Most common presentation.
*   **Symptoms:** Sudden onset of fever, chills, headache (severe), and myalgia.
*   **Cardinal Signs:**
    *   **[[Calf Muscle Tenderness]]** (Severe pain in legs).
    *   **[[Conjunctival Suffusion]]** (Redness of eyes without pus/discharge).
*   Also includes nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

**B. Icteric Leptospirosis ([[Weil's Disease]])**
*   Severe form involving multiple organs.
*   **Liver:** Jaundice (often orange-yellow hue), hepatomegaly.
*   **Kidney:** Renal failure (oliguria, proteinuria, elevated creatinine). This is a common cause of death.
*   **Hemorrhagic diathesis:** Bleeding from nose, gums, GI tract, or lungs (pulmonary hemorrhage).
*   **Cardiovascular:** Myocarditis, hypotension, circulatory collapse.

> **Mnemonic for Symptoms: "LEPTO"**
> *   **L** - Liver damage (Jaundice) / **L**eg pain (Calf tenderness)
> *   **E** - Eyes (Conjunctival suffusion)
> *   **P** - Proteinuria / Renal failure
> *   **T** - Temperature (High fever)
> *   **O** - Oliguria (Low urine output)

### 5. Diagnosis

*   **Clinical:** History of exposure to floods/rats + Fever + Calf tenderness + Conjunctival suffusion.
*   **Laboratory:**
    *   **First Week:** Isolation of leptospires from **Blood** (Dark-field microscopy or culture).
    *   **Second Week onwards:** Isolation from **Urine**.
    *   **Serology:**
        *   **[[Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT)]]:** The **Gold Standard** test.
        *   **ELISA (IgM):** Useful for early diagnosis (positive as early as 2 days).
        *   **PCR:** Highly sensitive for early detection.

### 6. Treatment

*   **Mild Cases:** **[[Doxycycline]]** (100 mg BD for 7 days) or Amoxicillin/Ampicillin.
*   **Severe Cases:** IV **[[Penicillin G]]** (drug of choice) or IV Ceftriaxone.
*   **Supportive Care:** Management of renal failure (dialysis if needed) and fluid/electrolyte balance.

### 7. Prevention and Control

**A. Rodent Control**
*   Trapping and poisoning of rats.
*   Proper disposal of garbage to discourage rodent breeding.

**B. Environmental Sanitation**
*   Drainage of stagnant water.
*   Proper disposal of infected animal waste.
*    disinfection of water.

**C. Personal Protection**
*   Use of **protective clothing** (boots, gloves) for high-risk workers (sewer workers, farmers).
*   Covering skin lesions with waterproof dressings.
*   Avoid swimming in potentially contaminated waters.

**D. Chemoprophylaxis**
*   Recommended for individuals entering high-risk areas (e.g., disaster relief workers during floods).
*   **Drug:** **[[Doxycycline]]** 200 mg orally once a week.

**E. Vaccination**
*   Human vaccines are not widely available/used in India but exist in some countries for high-risk occupations.
*   Vaccination of domestic animals (dogs, cattle) prevents them from becoming carriers.
