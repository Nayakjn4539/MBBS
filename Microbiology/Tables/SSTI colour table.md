Molds with septate hyaline hyphae. Produce microconidia and/or macroconidia. | Based on habitat:  * **Anthropophilic:** Infect humans (e.g., *T. rubrum*). * **Zoophilic:** Infect animals, cause acute inflammation in humans (e.g., *M. canis*). * **Geophilic:** Soil inhabitants (e.g., *M. gypseum*). | - (Lesions are due to host inflammatory reaction to fungal antigens). | * **Transmission:** Direct contact with infected soil, animals, or humans. * **Pathogenesis:** Fungi grow in a centrifugal pattern in the stratum corneum. Invade hair shafts (ectothrix/endothrix) or nail plates. | - | * Presents as "tinea" or "ringworm" based on site. * Well-demarcated, annular, pruritic, scaly skin lesions with central clearing and raised edges. * **Tinea capitis** (scalp), **Tinea corporis** (body), **Tinea cruris** (groin), **Tinea pedis** (athlete's foot), **Tinea unguium** (nails). * **Kerion:** Painful, boggy inflammatory reaction on scalp. | Skin scrapings, hair plucks, nail clippings from the active margin of lesions. | **Direct Examination (KOH mount):** Specimen mounted in 10-40% KOH reveals thin, septate, hyaline hyphae with arthroconidia. | Culture on SDA with cycloheximide, incubated at 26-28°C for 4 weeks. | * Identification is based on colony morphology (growth rate, texture, pigment) and microscopic appearance (macroconidia, microconidia, special hyphae). * **Hair perforation test:** Positive for *T. mentagrophytes*, *M. canis*. * **Urease test:** Positive for *T. mentagrophytes*. | **Woods Lamp Examination:** Some *Microsporum* species and *T. schoenleinii* fluoresce. | * **Topical:** Whitfield ointment, tolnaftate. * **Oral:** Terbinafine or itraconazole are drugs of choice. Griseofulvin is an alternative. | - |
| Subcutaneous Mycoses | Diverse group of soil saprophytic fungi.  * **Mycetoma:** *Madurella, Pseudallescheria* (fungi); *Nocardia, Actinomadura* (bacteria). * **Sporotrichosis:** *Sporothrix schenckii*. * **Chromoblastomycosis:** *Fonsecaea, Phialophora, Cladosporium*. | Varies by disease:  * **Mycetoma:** Grains/granules in discharge. * **Sporotrichosis:** Thermally dimorphic (yeast in tissue, mold in culture). * **Chromoblastomycosis:** Dematiaceous (darkly pigmented) fungi forming sclerotic bodies. | - | - | * **Transmission:** Traumatic inoculation into skin from contaminated soil or decaying vegetation (e.g., thorn prick). * Confined to tropics/subtropics. * Disease evolves slowly, forming chronic granulomatous lesions in skin, subcutaneous tissue, and sometimes bone. | - | * **Mycetoma (Madura foot):** Triad of swelling (tumefaction), discharging sinuses, and granules in discharge. * **Sporotrichosis (Rose Gardner's disease):** Noduloulcerative lesions along lymphatics (**sporotrichoid pattern**). * **Chromoblastomycosis:** Polymorphic, verrucose (warty), crusted, or ulcerative lesions. | Pus, discharge, granules, or tissue biopsy from the lesion. | Histopathological staining is key.  * **Sporotrichosis:** Cigar-shaped yeast cells, **asteroid bodies** (Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon). * **Chromoblastomycosis:** Brown, thick-walled, round, septate cells called **sclerotic bodies** or Medlar bodies. * **Mycetoma:** Granules with fungal hyphae or bacterial filaments. | Culture on SDA. *S. schenckii* is incubated at 25°C (mold form) and 37°C (yeast form). | Identification based on culture and microscopic morphology. | Serology (latex agglutination) and skin test for sporotrichosis. | Varies by agent.  * **Sporotrichosis:** Itraconazole. * **Mycetoma:** Surgical removal plus antifungals (itraconazole) or antibiotics (Welsh regimen). * **Chromoblastomycosis:** Surgical removal plus itraconazole. | - |
| Mucocutaneous Candidiasis | *Candida* species, primarily *Candida albicans*. | Dimorphic fungus, exists as oval, budding yeast cells and as pseudohyphae or true hyphae. Gram-positive. | - | - | Infection is usually endogenous, resulting from overgrowth of commensal flora due to predisposing factors like immunosuppression, antibiotic use, or local moisture. | - | * **Mucosal Candidiasis:** **Oropharyngeal (oral thrush)** - white, adherent, painless patches in mouth. **Vulvovaginitis** - pruritus, pain, whitish curd-like discharge. Esophageal candidiasis. * **Cutaneous Candidiasis:** **Intertrigo** (in skin folds), **paronychia** (nail-skin interface), **diaper candidiasis**. * **Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis:** Seen in patients with deficient CMI (T-cell defect). * **Allergic Candidiasis (Candidid):** Vesicular 'id' reaction. | Whitish mucosal patches, skin scrapings, nail clippings. | **Direct microscopy (Gram stain or KOH):** Shows gram-positive, oval, budding yeast cells with pseudohyphae. | * **Culture on SDA:** Produces creamy white, pasty colonies. * **CHROMagar:** Used for presumptive species identification based on colony color. | * **Germ tube test:** Positive for *C. albicans* (forms germ tubes in serum at 37°C). * **Dalmau plate culture:** For chlamydospore production by *C. albicans*. | Molecular methods such as PCR. | * **Cutaneous/Oral Thrush:** Topical azoles (clotrimazole, miconazole) or nystatin. * **Esophageal/Vulvovaginal:** Oral fluconazole or caspofungin. | - |
