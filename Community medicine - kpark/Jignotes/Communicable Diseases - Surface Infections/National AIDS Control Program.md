# [[Communicable Diseases - Surface Infections]] > National AIDS Control Program

### National AIDS Control Program (NACP)

The [[National AIDS Control Program]] (NACP) is a comprehensive scheme launched by the Government of India to prevent and control HIV/AIDS. It is implemented by the **National AIDS Control Organization ([[NACO]])** under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

**Launched:** 1987
**Current Phase:** NACP Phase V (Strategy 2017-2024)

### 1. Epidemiological Determinants (The Disease Profile)

*   **Agent:** **Human Immunodeficiency Virus** (Retrovirus).
    *   **Types:** HIV-1 (Most common worldwide and India) and HIV-2.
    *   **Subtype in India:** [[HIV-1]] Group M, Subtype C is the most prevalent.
    *   **Target:** CD4+ T Lymphocytes (Helper T cells).
*   **Source of Infection:** Cases and Carriers.
*   **Mode of Transmission:**
    1.  **Sexual:** Most common route (approx. 86-87% in India).
    2.  **Blood/Blood Products:** Most efficient route (>90% risk per exposure).
    3.  **Parent to Child (Vertical):** 25-30% risk without intervention.
    4.  **Infected Needles/Syringes:** IDUs (Injecting Drug Users).
*   **Incubation Period:** Variable; ranges from a few months to 10 years or more (Average 10 years).
*   **Window Period:** Time from infection to antibody detection (approx. 3-12 weeks). The patient is highly infectious but tests negative.

### 2. Vision, Goals, and Targets

**Vision:** Paving the way for an **AIDS Free India**.

**Goal: "Three Zeros"**
1.  Zero New Infections.
2.  Zero AIDS-related Deaths.
3.  Zero Discrimination.

**Targets (95-95-95) by 2024:**
*   **95%** of people living with HIV know their status.
*   **95%** of people diagnosed are on [[Antiretroviral Therapy]] (ART).
*   **95%** of people on ART have viral suppression.

---

### 3. Organizational Strategy

NACP operates through specific interventions based on risk groups:

**A. Targeted Interventions (TI) for High-Risk Groups (HRGs)**
*   **Core High-Risk Groups:** Female Sex Workers (**FSW**), Men having Sex with Men (**MSM**), Injecting Drug Users (**IDU**), Transgenders (**TG**).
*   **Bridge Population:** Truckers, Migrant laborers (they transmit infection from HRGs to the general population).
*   **Activities:** Condom promotion, Needle Syringe Exchange Program (NSEP), Opioid Substitution Therapy ([[OST]]).

**B. Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres ([[ICTC]])**
*   Hub for counseling and testing.
*   Located at Medical Colleges, District Hospitals, CHCs.
*   **Types:** Fixed facility (Standalone/Integrated) and Mobile ICTC.
*   **Policy:** **Opt-out** screening is recommended for pregnant women (routine offer of testing unless declined).

### 4. Diagnosis Strategies (NACO Guidelines)

**Tests Used:** **E/R/S** (ELISA, Rapid, Simple).
**Confirmatory Test:** Western Blot (though modern algorithms rely on three distinct antibody tests).

**> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Flowchart of HIV Testing Strategies I, II, III**

| Strategy | Purpose | Number of Tests Required | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strategy I** | **Transfusion/Transplant Safety** (Blood Banks) | **One** (Highly Sensitive) | If Negative: Safe to transfuse.<br>If Positive: Discard. Do NOT inform donor. |
| **Strategy II** | **Surveillance** & **Diagnosis in Symptomatic** patients | **Two** (Different antigens) | Both +ve: Positive.<br>If 1st +ve & 2nd -ve: Indeterminate. |
| **Strategy III** | **Diagnosis in Asymptomatic** individuals | **Three** (Different antigens/principles) | All 3 +ve: Positive.<br>Used for VCTC/ICTC diagnosis. |

> *Note: For children < 18 months, antibody tests are not reliable due to maternal antibodies. **DNA PCR** (Dried Blood Spot) is used for Early Infant Diagnosis (EID).*

### 5. Treatment: Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)

**Initiation Policy:** **"Treat All"** Policy.
*   ART is initiated in **ALL** individuals confirmed HIV positive, **irrespective of CD4 count**, clinical stage, age, or population.

**Preferred First-Line Regimens:**

| Patient Group | Preferred Regimen | FDC (Fixed Dose Combination) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Adults & Adolescents** (>30 kg) | **T + L + D** | **Tenofovir (300mg) + Lamivudine (300mg) + Dolutegravir (50mg)** |
| **Children** (6-10 yrs / 20-30 kg) | **A + L + D** | Abacavir + Lamivudine + Dolutegravir |
| **Alternative (Renal issues)** | **A + L + D** | Abacavir replaces Tenofovir |

*   **Viral Load Monitoring:** Done at 6 months, 12 months, and then annually to check efficacy.

---

### 6. Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission ([[PPTCT]])

*   **Risk:** Without intervention ~30%. With intervention <5%.
*   **Regimen (Option B+):** Life-long ART (**TLD**) for the mother regardless of CD4 count.
*   **Infant Prophylaxis:**
    *   **Nevirapine (NVP)** syrup for 6 weeks (if mother is on ART for >24 weeks).
    *   **NVP + Zidovudine** for 6-12 weeks (if mother has high viral load or unsuppressed).
*   **Breastfeeding:** Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months is recommended even if HIV positive (with adherence to ART).

---

### 7. Post-Exposure Prophylaxis ([[PEP]])

Used for accidental exposure (e.g., needle stick injury in healthcare workers).
*   **Timing:** Start **ASAP** (within 2 hours is best). **Not effective after 72 hours**.
*   **Duration:** 28 days.
*   **Regimen:** **Tenofovir + Lamivudine + Dolutegravir (TLD)**.

### 8. STI/RTI Control: Suraksha Clinics

STIs increase HIV transmission risk by 8-10 times. Syndromic management is used at **Suraksha Clinics**.

### 9. Clinical Relevance & Updates

*   **HIV-TB Coinfection:**
    *   TB is the most common Opportunistic Infection (OI) in India.
    *   **Strategy:** Start **ATT (Anti-Tubercular Treatment)** first. Start ART after 2 weeks of tolerating ATT.
    *   **Prophylaxis:** **Cotrimoxazole Preventive Therapy (CPT)** is given to prevent Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) if CD4 < 350.
*   **Red Ribbon Club:** Youth intervention program in colleges to raise awareness.
*   **99 DOTS / MERM:** Adherence monitoring technologies used for HIV-TB co-infected patients.
