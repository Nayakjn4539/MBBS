# [[PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IN OBSTETRICS, PAEDIATRICS AND GERIATRICS]] > Define "Low Birth Weight ". What is its prevalence in India and the target to achieve? What measures would you like to adopt as BMOH to reduce the Low Birth Weight in your block.

### Definition of Low Birth Weight

**[[Low Birth Weight]] (LBW)** is defined as a birth weight of **less than 2500 grams** (up to and including 2499 g), irrespective of the gestational age,,.

*   **Timing:** The measurement should preferably be taken within the **first hour of life**, before significant postnatal weight loss has occurred,,.
*   **Classification:** LBW babies include two main groups:
    1.  **[[Preterm babies]]:** Born before 37 completed weeks of gestation (< 259 days),.
    2.  **[[Small-for-date]] (SFD) babies:** Born at term or preterm but weigh less than the 10th percentile for their gestational age (due to [[Intrauterine Growth Retardation]]),.

> **Clinical Relevance:** LBW is the single most important determinant of a child's chance of survival, healthy growth, and development. The infant mortality rate (IMR) is about 20 times greater for LBW babies than for normal-weight babies.

### Prevalence and Targets in India

| Parameter | Statistics/Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Current Prevalence** | Approximately **18% - 28%** of babies born in India are LBW,. <br> *(Note: While traditional estimates were around 28-30%, the Rapid Survey on Children 2014 cited 18.6%)*,. |
| **National Target** | To reduce the incidence of Low Birth Weight to **less than 10%**,. |
| **NNM Target** | Under the [[National Nutrition Mission]] (Poshan Abhiyaan), the target is to reduce low birth weight by **2% per annum**. |

### Measures to Reduce Low Birth Weight (As BMOH)

As a **Block Medical Officer of Health (BMOH)**, the approach to reducing LBW must be multifactorial, focusing on [[Direct Interventions]] (targeting malnutrition and infection) and [[Indirect Interventions]] (improving social status and family planning),.

#### 1. Strengthening Antenatal Care (ANC)
*   **Early Registration:** Ensure 100% registration of pregnant women within the first trimester (12 weeks).
*   **Minimum Visits:** Enforce the protocol of at least **4 ANC visits** to monitor fetal growth and maternal health,.
*   **Identification of "At Risk" Mothers:** Train ANMs and ASHAs to screen for high-risk factors such as:
    *   Maternal weight < 40 kg or height < 145 cm.
    *   Severe anemia (Hb < 7 g/dl).
    *   High blood pressure (Pre-eclampsia).
    *   Multiple pregnancies or history of previous LBW,.

#### 2. Nutritional Interventions (Direct Measures)
*   **Supplementary Feeding:** Coordinate with the [[ICDS]] scheme to ensuring pregnant women receive supplementary nutrition at Anganwadi centers to bridge the calorie/protein gap.
*   **Anemia Prophylaxis:** Strict implementation of the **[[Anemia Mukt Bharat]]** strategy. Ensure distribution and compliance of Iron and Folic Acid (IFA) tablets (100 mg elemental iron + 500 mcg folic acid) daily for at least 100 days,.
*   **Weight Gain Monitoring:** Monitor maternal weight gain; a gain of **9–11 kg** during pregnancy is optimal. If weight gain is < 2 kg/month, supplementary feeding is critical,.

#### 3. Infection Control
*   **Screening and Treatment:** Detect and treat infections that cause intrauterine growth retardation, such as:
    *   **Urinary Tract Infections (UTI)**.
    *   **Malaria:** In endemic zones, ensure chemoprophylaxis and use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITBN),.
    *   **Helminthiasis:** Deworming during the second trimester.
    *   **[[Tetanus Toxoid]]:** Ensure 2 doses of TT/Td to prevent neonatal tetanus.

#### 4. Managing Medical Disorders
*   **Chronic Diseases:** Early detection and management of [[Diabetes]] and **Hypertension** (Toxemia of pregnancy) which significantly affect fetal growth.
*   **Tobacco/Alcohol Cessation:** Counsel against smoking and tobacco chewing, as nicotine causes placental insufficiency leading to a weight reduction of ~170g in the newborn,.

#### 5. Family Planning and Social Measures (Indirect Interventions)
*   **Birth Spacing:** Promote family planning to ensure a birth interval of at least **2–3 years**. This allows the mother to replenish nutritional stores,.
*   **Prevention of Teenage Pregnancy:** Discourage early marriage and childbearing (before 19 years), as the mother herself is still growing.
*   **Reduction of Hard Labor:** Advise rest, especially in the last trimester, and avoidance of heavy physical work.

#### 6. Monitoring and Evaluation
*   **Action Plan:** Utilize the **[[Mother and Child Protection Card]]** (MCP Card) to track beneficiaries.
*   **Training:** Train **[[ASHA]]** and **[[ANM]]** workers on counseling mothers regarding diet, rest, and danger signs.

*   **C**ontrol Infections (Malaria, UTI)
*   **A**ntenatal Check-ups (Min 4 visits)
*   **R**est and reduced heavy work
*   **E**arly registration of pregnancy
