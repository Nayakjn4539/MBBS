# [[Ear]] > Development of Ear and Anomalies

### Development of the Ear and Anomalies

The ear has a complex embryological origin. The sound-conducting apparatus (external and middle ear) develops from the [[branchial apparatus]], while the sound-perceptive apparatus (inner ear) develops from the ectodermal otic cyst. Because of these distinct origins, congenital anomalies often affect either the conductive or perceptive systems independently, though they can coexist.

### 1. Development of the External Ear

#### A. The Pinna (Auricle)
*   **Time of Development:** Begins around the **6th week** of intrauterine life.
*   **Origin:** Develops from **6 Mesodermal Thickenings** known as **[[Hillocks of His]]** that appear around the **1st Branchial Cleft**.
    *   **1st Branchial Arch (Mandibular):** Gives rise to Hillocks 1, 2, and 3.
    *   **2nd Branchial Arch (Hyoid):** Gives rise to Hillocks 4, 5, and 6.
*   **Derivatives of Hillocks:**
    *   **1st Arch:** Forms the **==Tragus==** and part of the Helix.
    *   **2nd Arch:** Forms the rest of the pinna (==Helix, Antihelix, Scapha, Antitragus, Lobule==).
*   **Migration:** Initially, the pinna is located low on the neck. By the **20th week**, it attains adult shape and migrates dorsolaterally and cranially to its final position.

#### B. External Auditory Canal (EAC)
*   **Origin:** Develops from the **dorsal part** of the **1st Branchial Cleft** (ectoderm).
*   **Process:**
    *   Ectoderm proliferates to form a solid **meatal plug** around the 16th week.
    *   **Recanalization:** The plug dissolves (canalizes) from **medial to lateral** (from the tympanic membrane outwards) to form the epithelial lining.
    *   **Timeline:** Fully formed by the **28th week**.
*   **At Birth:** Only the cartilaginous part is fully developed. The bony part is incomplete, and the tympanic membrane is more horizontally placed.

### 2. Anomalies of the External Ear

| Anomaly                    | Pathology/Description                                                                                    | Clinical Significance                                                                                                                     |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[[Preauricular Sinus]]** | Incomplete fusion of the auricular tubercles (Hillocks of His). Common between Tragus and Crus of Helix. | Can get recurrently infected causing discharge or abscess. Requires surgical excision (Sinusectomy).                                      |
| **[[Microtia]]**           | Small, malformed auricle. Varies in severity. "Peanut ear" is a severe form.                             | Often associated with meatal atresia and conductive hearing loss. Reconstruction using costal cartilage is done after **6 years** of age. |
| **[[Anotia]]**             | Complete absence of pinna.                                                                               | Severe cosmetic deformity.                                                                                                                |
| **[[Bat Ear]]**            | Abnormally prominent/protruding ear due to poorly developed antihelix.                                   | Cosmetic concern; corrected by Pinnaplasty/Otoplasty.                                                                                     |
| **[[Collaural Fistula]]**  | Persistent ventral part of the 1st Branchial Cleft.                                                      | Connection between the neck (angle of mandible) and the EAC.                                                                              |
| **[[Meatal Atresia]]**     | Failure of recanalization of the meatal plug.                                                            | Causes Conductive Hearing Loss. Deep meatus may be normal if lateral recanalization failed.                                               |
| **[[Darwin's Tubercle]]**  | Pointed prominence on the upper helix.                                                                   | Remnant of apex of pinna in lower animals; harmless.                                                                                      |

### 3. Development of the Middle Ear

#### A. Tympanic Membrane (TM)
*   Derived from all three germ layers:
    1.  **Outer Layer:** Ectoderm (from 1st Branchial Cleft/Groove).
    2.  **Middle Layer:** Mesoderm (Fibrous layer).
    3.  **Inner Layer:** Endoderm (from 1st Pharyngeal Pouch).

#### B. Middle Ear Cleft (Cavity & Eustachian Tube)
*   **Origin:** Endoderm of the **[[Tubotympanic Recess]]** (derived from the **1st Pharyngeal Pouch** and partly the 2nd).
    *   **Proximal Part:** Forms the **[[Eustachian Tube]]**.
    *   **Distal Part:** Expands to form the **[[Tympanic Cavity]]** and **[[Mastoid Antrum]]**.

#### C. Ossicles
*   **Malleus & Incus:** Derived from the **1st Branchial Arch** (Meckel’s Cartilage).
*   **Stapes Superstructure:** Derived from the **2nd Branchial Arch** (Reichert’s Cartilage).
*   **Stapes Footplate:** Derived from the **[[Otic Capsule]]** (Bony Labyrinth).
*   **Timeline:** Ossicles attain adult size and shape by **20–25 weeks** of gestation.

> **Mnemonic for Ossicles:** 
> **M**alleus & **I**ncus = **M**eckel’s (**1**st Arch). 
> **S**tapes = **S**econd Arch.

#### D. Mastoid
*   **Antrum:** Present at birth (the only large air cell).
*   **Air Cells:** Pneumatization occurs postnatally (90% by age 6).
*   **Mastoid Tip:** Develops around **2 years** of age due to the pull of the Sternocleidomastoid muscle.
    *   *Clinical Implication:* In infants (<2 years), the [[facial nerve]] is superficial and exposed; post-auricular incisions must be modified (higher and more horizontal) to avoid injury.

### 4. Anomalies of the Middle Ear

*   **[[Congenital Cholesteatoma]]**: Arises from embryonic epidermal cell rests (white pearly mass behind intact TM).
*   **Ossicular Anomalies**: Fixation of the stapes footplate is a common cause of congenital conductive hearing loss.
*   **Facial Nerve Dehiscence**: The fallopian canal is congenitally dehiscent in up to 50% of cases, commonly above the oval window, increasing surgical risk.

---

### 5. Development of the Inner Ear

*   **Origin:** Develops from **Surface Ectoderm** (Neuro-ectoderm).
*   **Sequence:**
    1.  **[[Otic Placode]]**: Thickening of ectoderm overlying the hindbrain.
    2.  **Otic Pit**: Placode invaginates.
    3.  **[[Otic Vesicle]] (Otocyst)**: Differentiates into the membranous labyrinth.
*   **Timeline:** Begins in the 3rd week; fully formed by **16th–20th week**. The fetus can hear in the womb by 20 weeks.

#### Differentiation of the Otocyst
1.  **Pars Superior (Phylogenetically older):** Forms the **[[Utricle]]** and **[[Semicircular Canals]]**.
2.  **Pars Inferior (Phylogenetically younger):** Forms the **[[Saccule]]** and **[[Cochlea]]**.

*   **Bony Labyrinth (Otic Capsule):** Forms from mesenchyme surrounding the membranous labyrinth. Ossifies from 14 centers between 16–21 weeks.

### 6. Anomalies of the Inner Ear (Aplasias/Dysplasias)

Defects in the inner ear are major causes of congenital [[Sensorineural Hearing Loss]] (SNHL).

| Anomaly | Description | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Michel Aplasia]]** | Complete absence of bony and membranous labyrinth. | Rare. Absolute contraindication for cochlear implant. |
| **[[Mondini Dysplasia]]** | Incomplete partition of the cochlea. | Cochlea has **1.5 turns** (instead of 2.5–2.75). Associated with enlarged vestibular aqueduct and spontaneous CSF leaks/meningitis. |
| **[[Scheibe Aplasia]]** | Cochleosaccular dysplasia. | **Most common** congenital anomaly. Pars inferior (cochlea/saccule) is malformed; Pars superior (semicircular canals) is normal. |
| **[[Alexander Aplasia]]** | Dysplasia of the **basal turn** of cochlea. | Causes High-frequency SNHL. |
| **[[Large Vestibular Aqueduct]]**| Enlarged endolymphatic duct/sac. | Associated with Pendred syndrome. Hearing loss may progress with minor head trauma. |

### 7. Syndromic Associations with Ear Anomalies

*   **[[Treacher Collins Syndrome]] (Mandibulofacial Dysostosis):** 1st Arch syndrome. Microtia, atresia of EAC, ossicular malformations, conductive hearing loss.
*   **[[Waardenburg Syndrome]]**: White forelock, heterochromia iridis, SNHL.
*   **[[Pendred Syndrome]]**: Thyroid goiter + SNHL (often with Mondini dysplasia/Large Vestibular Aqueduct).
*   **[[Usher Syndrome]]**: Retinitis pigmentosa + SNHL.
*   **[[Alport Syndrome]]**: Nephritis (kidney disease) + SNHL.
*   **[[CHARGE Syndrome]]**: **C**oloboma, **H**eart defects, **A**tresia choanae, **R**etarded growth, **G**enital hypoplasia, **E**ar anomalies.
