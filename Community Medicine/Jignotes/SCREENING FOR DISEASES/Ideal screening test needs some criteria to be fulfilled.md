# [[SCREENING FOR DISEASES]] > Ideal screening test needs some criteria to be fulfilled

# Criteria for an Ideal Screening Test

Before initiating a [[Screening Programme]], a decision must be made regarding whether it is scientifically, ethically, and financially justifiable. The criteria for an ideal screening test are broadly divided into two categories: characteristics of the **Disease** and characteristics of the **Test** itself.

## 1. Criteria Related to the Disease
According to the **[[Wilson and Jungner criteria]]**, the disease sought should fulfill the following conditions to be suitable for screening:

1.  **Important Health Problem:** The condition should be a significant health issue in the community, usually implying a high prevalence or high mortality/morbidity.
2.  **Recognizable Latent Stage:** There must be a recognizable latent or early asymptomatic phase during which the disease can be detected.
3.  **Understanding of Natural History:** The natural history of the condition, particularly the development from latent to declared disease, should be adequately understood.
4.  **Test Availability:** There must be a test or examination capable of detecting the disease prior to the onset of signs and symptoms.
5.  **Effective Treatment:** There should be an accepted and effective treatment available for patients with recognized disease.
6.  **Agreed Policy:** There must be an agreed-upon policy concerning whom to treat (e.g., defining the borderline between "diseased" and "normal").

## 2. Criteria Related to the Screening Test
For a test to be considered ideal for use in a mass population, it must satisfy specific requirements:

### A. Acceptability
The test should not be painful, discomforting, or embarrassing. If a test is invasive or unpleasant (e.g., rectal or vaginal examinations in certain cultures), the population participation rate will be low, defeating the purpose of the program.

### B. Repeatability (Reliability/Precision)
The test must yield consistent results when repeated more than once on the same individual under the same conditions. Reliability is influenced by:
*   **Observer Variation:** Intra-observer (same doctor, different results) and Inter-observer (different doctors, different results).
*   **Biological Variation:** Fluctuations in parameters like BP or blood sugar.
*   **Technical Errors:** Faulty equipment or reagents.

### C. Validity (Accuracy)
This refers to the ability of the test to separate those who have the disease from those who do not. It has two vital components:
*   **[[Sensitivity]]:** The ability to correctly identify all those *with* the disease (True Positives). High sensitivity means few false negatives.
*   **[[Specificity]]:** The ability to correctly identify those *without* the disease (True Negatives). High specificity means few false positives.

### D. Other Factors
*   **Simplicity:** It should be easy to administer by paramedical staff.
*   **Cost:** It should be relatively inexpensive.
*   **Safety:** It should not harm the individual (e.g., avoiding excessive radiation).

## 3. Comparison: Screening vs. Diagnostic Test
Ideally, a screening test differs significantly from a diagnostic test.

| Feature | Screening Test | Diagnostic Test |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Target** | Apparently healthy individuals | Sick patients with symptoms |
| **Accuracy** | Relatively less accurate | Highly accurate |
| **Cost** | Cheap | Expensive |
| **Result** | Not final (needs confirmation) | Final diagnosis |
| **Basis for Treatment** | Not a basis for treatment | Used as a basis for treatment |
| **Initiative** | Comes from the investigator | Comes from the patient (complaint) |

### Mnemonic for Screening Criteria: "SAFE TEA"

*   **S** - **S**imple and Safe
*   **A** - **A**cceptable to the population
*   **F** - **F**acilities for diagnosis/treatment available
*   **E** - **E**conomical (Cost-effective)
*   **T** - **T**reatable disease (Effective treatment exists)
*   **E** - **E**arly asymptomatic stage exists
*   **A** - **A**ccurate (Valid and Reliable)

### Clinical Relevance
*   **Pap Smear:** A classic example of an ideal screening test for [[Cervical Cancer]]. It detects the disease in the pre-invasive (latent) stage, is relatively cheap, and effective treatment (cryotherapy/LEEP) is available for early lesions.
*   **Mammography:** While effective for breast cancer, it faces challenges in **Acceptability** due to discomfort and potential radiation risk (Safety), requiring careful risk-benefit analysis.
