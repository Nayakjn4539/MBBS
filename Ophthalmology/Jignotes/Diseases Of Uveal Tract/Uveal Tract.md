# Anatomy and Physiology of the Uveal Tract

The [[Uveal Tract]] (or Uvea) constitutes the middle vascular coat of the [[eyeball]]. Anatomically, it is divided into three parts from anterior to posterior: the [[Iris]], [[Ciliary Body]], and [[Choroid]]. However, developmentally, structurally, and functionally, these parts form one continuous tract.

### 1. The Iris

The [[Iris]] is the anterior-most part of the uveal tract. It is a thin circular disc with a central aperture called the [[Pupil]], which acts like the diaphragm of a camera to regulate the amount of light reaching the [[Retina]].

#### Gross Anatomy
*   **Dimensions:** Approximately 12 mm in diameter.
*   **Root:** The peripheral attachment to the middle of the anterior surface of the [[Ciliary Body]]. It is the **thinnest part** of the iris and liable to tear away from the ciliary body (iridodialysis) following blunt trauma.
*   **Collarette:** A zig-zag line on the anterior surface, representing the attachment of the embryonic pupillary membrane. It divides the iris into two zones:
    1.  **Pupillary Zone:** Inner zone (flat and smooth).
    2.  **Ciliary Zone:** Outer zone (contains radial streaks and crypts).
*   **Crypts:** Depressions where the superficial layer of the iris is missing, found near the iris root (peripheral crypts) and near the collarette (central crypts).

#### Microscopic Structure
From anterior to posterior, the iris consists of four layers:
1.  **Anterior Limiting Layer:** Condensed stroma containing [[Melanocytes]] and [[Fibroblasts]]. It determines the definitive colour of the iris (thin in blue iris, thick in brown iris).
2.  **Iris Stroma:** Loosely arranged collagenous network containing the sphincter and dilator muscles, vessels, nerves, and pigment cells.
3.  **Anterior Pigmented Epithelial Layer:** Forward continuation of the pigment epithelium of the retina and ciliary body.
4.  **Posterior Pigmented Epithelial Layer:** Forward continuation of the non-pigmented epithelium of the ciliary body.

#### Muscles of the Iris
The iris contains two involuntary muscles derived from [[Neuroectoderm]]:

| Muscle | Location | Arrangement | Action | Nerve Supply |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Sphincter Pupillae]]** | Pupillary zone | Circular band (1mm broad) | **Miosis** (Constriction) | Parasympathetic (via [[Oculomotor Nerve]] / CN III) |
| **[[Dilator Pupillae]]** | Ciliary zone | Radial fibres | **Mydriasis** (Dilation) | Sympathetic system (via Cervical sympathetic chain) |

**Clinical Implications:**
*   **[[Iridodialysis]]:** Detachment of the iris from its root (thinnest part) due to trauma, resulting in a D-shaped pupil.
*   **[[Synechiae]]:** Adhesions of the iris to the cornea (anterior) or lens (posterior) due to inflammation.

### 2. The Ciliary Body

The [[Ciliary Body]] is the forward continuation of the choroid at the [[Ora Serrata]]. In cross-section, it is triangular with the base facing the anterior chamber and the apex continuous with the choroid.

#### Parts
1.  **[[Pars Plicata]] (Anterior 2mm):** Contains about 70-80 finger-like projections called **[[Ciliary Processes]]**. These are the primary sites for **[[Aqueous Humour]]** production.
2.  **[[Pars Plana]] (Posterior 4mm):** A smooth, relatively avascular area extending to the ora serrata. This is the safe zone for surgical entry into the vitreous cavity.

#### Microscopic Structure
From outside inwards, it consists of:
1.  **Supraciliary Lamina:** Outermost condensed stroma.
2.  **Stroma:** Contains the **[[Ciliary Muscle]]**.
3.  **Layer of Pigmented Epithelium:** Continuous with Retinal Pigment Epithelium ([[RPE]]).
4.  **Layer of Non-pigmented Epithelium:** Continuous with the sensory retina; responsible for aqueous secretion.
5.  **Internal Limiting Membrane.**

#### Ciliary Muscle
A non-striated muscle involved in **[[Accommodation]]**. It consists of three fibers:
*   **Longitudinal (Meridional) fibres:** Help in aqueous outflow.
*   **Circular fibres:** Help in accommodation (relax zonules).
*   **Radial (Oblique) fibres.**

**Functions:**
1.  **Aqueous Production:** Secretion by the non-pigmented epithelium of the ciliary processes.
2.  **Accommodation:** Contraction of ciliary muscles increases the refractive power of the lens.

### 3. The Choroid

The [[Choroid]] is the highly vascular posterior portion of the uveal tract, extending from the optic disc to the ora serrata. Its inner surface contacts the RPE, and the outer surface faces the [[Sclera]] with the **[[Suprachoroidal Space]]** in between.

#### Layers (From External to Internal)
1.  **Suprachoroidal Lamina:** Condensed collagen fibers and melanocytes.
2.  **Choroidal Stroma:** Contains vessels arranged in layers:
    *   **Haller’s Layer:** Large vessels (outer).
    *   **Sattler’s Layer:** Medium vessels.
3.  **[[Choriocapillaris]]:** Layer of capillaries nourishing the outer layers of the retina.
4.  **[[Bruch's Membrane]] (Basal Lamina):** The innermost layer lying adjacent to the retinal pigment epithelium.

**Clinical Implication:**
*   **[[Choroiditis]]:** Inflammation of the choroid, often involving the overlying retina ([[Chorioretinitis]]) because the outer retinal layers depend on the choroid for nutrition.

### 4. Blood Supply of the Uveal Tract

The blood supply is derived mainly from the **[[Ophthalmic Artery]]** via three sets of ciliary arteries:

#### Arterial Supply
| Artery Group | Origin/Course | Supply Area |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Short Posterior Ciliary Arteries (SPCA)** | 10-20 branches piercing sclera around [[Optic Nerve]] | **[[Choroid]]** (segmental manner) and [[Optic Disc]] |
| **Long Posterior Ciliary Arteries (LPCA)** | 2 arteries (Nasal & Temporal) piercing sclera obliquely | **[[Ciliary Body]]** and **[[Iris]]** |
| **Anterior Ciliary Arteries (ACA)** | Derived from muscular branches of Ophthalmic Artery | **[[Iris]]** and **[[Ciliary Body]]** |

*   **[[Major Arterial Circle]] of Iris:** Formed at the root of the iris by the anastomosis of **LPCA** and **ACA**.
*   **[[Minor Arterial Circle]] of Iris:** Formed near the pupillary margin.

#### Venous Drainage
Venous blood from the iris, ciliary body, and choroid drains into **4 [[Vortex Veins]]** (Venae Verticosae). These pierce the sclera behind the equator and drain into the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins.

### 5. Nerve Supply

The uveal tract receives nerve supply via the **[[Ciliary Ganglion]]** and **[[Ciliary Nerves]]**:

1.  **Sensory:** Via **Nasociliary nerve** (Branch of Trigeminal Nerve, CN V).
2.  **Motor (Parasympathetic):** Via **[[Oculomotor Nerve]]** (CN III) $\rightarrow$ Ciliary Ganglion $\rightarrow$ Short Ciliary Nerves $\rightarrow$ supplies Sphincter Pupillae (Miosis) and Ciliary Muscle (Accommodation).
3.  **Sympathetic:** Via cervical sympathetic chain $\rightarrow$ Long Ciliary Nerves $\rightarrow$ supplies Dilator Pupillae (Mydriasis) and blood vessels (Vasoconstriction).

**Mnemonic for Iris Muscles Action:**
*   **S**phincter = **S**hrinks pupil (Parasympathetic).
*   **D**ilator = **D**ilates pupil (Sympathetic).
