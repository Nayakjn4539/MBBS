# [[Trachea]] > Anatomy and Stenosis of Trachea

### Anatomy of Trachea

**Structure and Dimensions**
The [[trachea]] (windpipe) is a cartilaginous and membranous tube that acts as a conduit for air between the larynx and the bronchi.
*   **Extent:** Extends from the lower border of the [[cricoid cartilage]] (level of C6 vertebra) to the [[carina]] (bifurcation) at the level of the upper border of the T5 vertebra (T4 in cadavers).
*   **Length:** Approximately 10–12 cm in adults.
*   **Diameter:** 2–2.5 cm (narrower in females and children).
*   **Composition:**
    *   **Cartilage:** Consists of 16–20 C-shaped hyaline cartilages.
    *   **Posterior Wall:** The cartilages are deficient posteriorly. This gap is bridged by a fibrous membrane and smooth muscle fibers known as the [[trachealis muscle]].
    *   **Lining:** Lined by pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium (respiratory epithelium).

**Relations**
The relations are critical for safe performance of [[tracheostomy]] and thyroid surgery.

*   **Cervical Trachea Relations:**
    *   **Anterior:**
        *   [[Strap muscles]] (sternohyoid and sternothyroid).
        *   **Thyroid Isthmus:** Crosses the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th tracheal rings.
        *   Inferior thyroid veins and anterior jugular veins.
    *   **Lateral:**
        *   Lobes of the [[thyroid gland]] (down to the 6th ring).
        *   Common carotid artery and internal jugular vein (within the carotid sheath).
    *   **Posterior:**
        *   [[Esophagus]].
        *   [[Recurrent laryngeal nerve]] (RLN): Runs in the tracheoesophageal groove.

*   **Thoracic Trachea Relations:**
    *   **Anterior:** Manubrium sterni, thymus remnants, left brachiocephalic vein, arch of aorta.
    *   **Posterior:** Esophagus.
    *   **Lateral (Right):** Right lung/pleura, right vagus, azygos vein.
    *   **Lateral (Left):** Arch of aorta, left common carotid, left subclavian arteries, left recurrent laryngeal nerve.

**Blood and Nerve Supply**
*   **Arterial Supply:** Primarily the [[inferior thyroid artery]]. The lower trachea also receives supply from bronchial arteries.
*   **Venous Drainage:** Into the [[thyroid venous plexus]] and inferior thyroid veins.
*   **Nerve Supply:** Parasympathetic fibers from the [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]] (Vagus) and sympathetic fibers from the sympathetic chain.
*   **Lymphatic Drainage:** Pre-tracheal, paratracheal, and tracheobronchial lymph nodes.

**Clinical Anatomy**
*   **Tracheostomy:** Usually performed at the level of the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th tracheal rings (Mid-tracheostomy) to avoid the cricoid cartilage (risk of stenosis) and suprasternal vessels.
*   **Carina:** The keel-like ridge at the bifurcation. The right main bronchus is wider, shorter, and more vertical than the left, making it the most common site for foreign body impaction.

### Tracheal Stenosis

**Definition**
Narrowing of the tracheal lumen. It is often discussed in conjunction with subglottic stenosis as **laryngotracheal stenosis** (LTS) because the pathology frequently spans the subglottis and upper trachea.

**Etiology**
*   **Acquired (Most Common):**
    *   **Trauma (Iatrogenic):**
        *   **Prolonged Intubation:** High cuff pressure causes ischemic necrosis of tracheal mucosa, leading to fibrosis and scarring.
        *   **Tracheostomy:** High tracheostomy (through 1st ring) or cricothyroidotomy can cause subglottic stenosis. Tip of the tube can erode the tracheal wall.
    *   **External Trauma:** Blunt or penetrating neck injuries (fracture of laryngeal framework).
    *   **Infection:** Bacterial tracheitis, [[Scleroma]], Diphtheria, Tuberculosis.
    *   **Inflammatory/Granulomatous:** [[Wegener's granulomatosis]] (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis), Sarcoidosis, Relapsing polychondritis.
    *   **Neoplastic:** Benign or malignant tumors causing intrinsic obstruction or extrinsic compression.
*   **Congenital:**
    *   Complete tracheal rings, tracheal webs, or tracheal atresia.

**Clinical Features**
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Dyspnea:** Initially on exertion, progressing to dyspnea at rest.
    *   **Stridor:**
        *   **Inspiratory:** Obstruction at glottis/supraglottis.
        *   **Biphasic:** Obstruction at subglottis/cervical trachea.
        *   **Expiratory:** Intrathoracic tracheal/bronchial obstruction.
    *   Difficulty in clearing secretions.
    *   **History:** Failure to extubate or difficulty in decannulation of tracheostomy tube.

**Diagnosis**
*   **Imaging:**
    *   **X-ray Neck (Lateral/AP):** May show narrowing, but limited value.
    *   **CT Scan:** High-definition CT with 3D reconstruction is essential to assess the length, diameter, and site of the stenotic segment.
    *   **MRI:** Useful for soft tissue assessment.
*   **Endoscopy:**
    *   **Flexible/Rigid Bronchoscopy:** The gold standard to visualize the stenosis, assess the grade, and rule out other pathology.

**Grading (Myer-Cotton Grading System)**
Used for subglottic and tracheal stenosis based on the reduction of the cross-sectional area:

| Grade | % Obstruction | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Grade I** | 0 – 50% | Minor stenosis |
| **Grade II** | 51 – 70% | Moderate stenosis |
| **Grade III** | 71 – 99% | Severe stenosis (detectable lumen present) |
| **Grade IV** | 100% | No detectable lumen |

**Management**
Treatment depends on the grade, length, and maturity of the stenosis (soft/evolving vs. mature/fibrotic).

1.  **Medical/Conservative:**
    *   Humidification and antibiotics if infected.
    *   Systemic or intralesional steroids for granulation tissue.
    *   Anti-reflux medication (PPIs).

2.  **Endoscopic Management (For early/soft stenosis or short segments):**
    *   **Dilation:** Balloon dilation or bougie dilation.
    *   **Laser Excision:** CO2 laser used to make radial cuts in the stenosis.
    *   **Adjuvants:** Topical application of [[Mitomycin C]] to prevent re-scarring/fibrosis.
    *   **Stenting:** Insertion of silicone stents or [[Montgomery T-tube]] to maintain patency.

3.  **Open Surgical Management (For mature, severe, or long-segment stenosis):**
    *   **Laryngotracheal Reconstruction (LTR):** Expansion of the airway using cartilage grafts (costal or auricular) placed anteriorly and/or posteriorly after splitting the cricoid/trachea.
    *   **Tracheal Resection and Anastomosis:** Resection of the stenotic segment and end-to-end anastomosis. Suitable for stenosis < 4 cm in length. "Laryngeal drop" procedure may be needed to reduce tension.
    *   **Slide Tracheoplasty:** Used for congenital long-segment stenosis or complete tracheal rings.

**Clinical Implication:**
> **Prevention is key.** Use high-volume, low-pressure cuffs on endotracheal/tracheostomy tubes and avoid high tracheostomy (1st ring) to prevent ischemic necrosis and subsequent stenosis.
