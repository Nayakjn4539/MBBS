# [[PRINCIPLES OF EPIDEMIOLOGY]] > Significance of a false positive screening test

### Significance of a False Positive Screening Test

**Definition**
A [[False Positive (FP)]] result occurs when an individual **does not have the disease** but the screening test result is **positive**.
*   It amounts to giving the patient a "false alarm."
*   In statistical terms, this corresponds to cell **'b'** in the standard 2x2 contingency table,,.

**The 2x2 Contingency Table**

| Screening Test Result | Disease Present | Disease Absent (Healthy) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Positive** | True Positive (a) | **False Positive (b)** |
| **Negative** | False Negative (c) | True Negative (d) |

**Mathematical Calculation**
The False Positive Rate is calculated as the percentage of healthy individuals incorrectly identified as sick.

*   **Formula:** $\frac{b}{b + d} \times 100$
*   **Relationship with Specificity:** False Positive Rate = $1 - \text{Specificity}$,.
*   **Relationship with Predictive Value:** A high number of false positives significantly **lowers** the [[Positive Predictive Value (PPV)]] of the test.

### Significance and Consequences

The implications of a false positive result are extensive and affect the individual, the healthcare system, and the screening program itself.

**1. Impact on the Individual**
*   **Psychological Trauma:** The patient suffers from unnecessary anxiety, stress, and fear of having a serious disease (e.g., cancer) until the diagnosis is ruled out,.
*   **Physical Risk:** Healthy individuals are subjected to further **diagnostic tests** which may be invasive, uncomfortable, or carry their own risks (e.g., biopsy after a false positive mammogram),.
*   **Financial Burden:** The patient incurs unnecessary costs for travel, missed work, and expensive confirmatory diagnostic procedures.
*   **Social Stigma:** In diseases like [[HIV]] or [[Leprosy]], a false label can lead to social isolation or discrimination.

**2. Impact on the Health System**
*   **Overburdened Resources:** False positives burden the diagnostic facilities (laboratories, imaging centers) with normal cases, delaying care for those who are genuinely sick.
*   **Increased Cost:** It increases the overall cost of the health service without adding health benefits.

**3. Impact on the Screening Program**
*   **Discredit to the Program:** A high rate of false positives brings discredit to the screening program and reduces public confidence and participation.
*   **"Cry Wolf" Phenomenon:** Repeated false alarms may desensitize the population and physicians to future positive results.

### Factors Influencing False Positives

**1. The Cut-off Point**
*   In variables with a unimodal distribution (e.g., blood pressure, blood sugar), there is an overlap between "normal" and "diseased" populations.
*   If the **cut-off point is set too low** (to increase Sensitivity), the test captures more true cases but also captures more healthy people, drastically **increasing False Positives**,.

**2. Disease Prevalence**
*   In populations where the disease prevalence is **low**, the number of false positives will be proportionately **higher** than true positives, resulting in a very low Positive Predictive Value,.

**3. Test Specificity**
*   A test with low [[Specificity]] will inherently yield a high number of false positives. To avoid this, a screening test must be highly specific,.

### Clinical Management & Prevention

*   **Confirmatory Testing:** A screening test is **not final**. Persons with positive results must always be referred for a diagnostic test (Gold Standard) to confirm the disease,.
*   **High Specificity Requirement:** When false-positive errors must be avoided (e.g., starting toxic chemotherapy), a test with high specificity is chosen.
*   **Sequential Testing:** Using a sensitive test first (to catch cases) followed by a specific test (to rule out false positives) reduces the error rate.

### Mnemonic
**FALSE** Positive consequences:

*   **F** - Financial loss (expensive workups)
*   **A** - Anxiety and stress
*   **L** - Lowers Positive Predictive Value
*   **S** - Specificity is low (if FPs are high)
*   **E** - Excess load on diagnostic services
