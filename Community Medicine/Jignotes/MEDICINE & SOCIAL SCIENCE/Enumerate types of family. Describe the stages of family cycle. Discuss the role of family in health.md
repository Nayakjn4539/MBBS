# [[MEDICINE & SOCIAL SCIENCE]] > Enumerate types of family. Describe the stages of family cycle. Discuss the role of family in health and disease.

### Types of Family

Families are classified based on structure, authority, and residence. From a sociological and medical perspective, the following are the primary types:

1.  **[[Nuclear Family]] (Elementary/Unitary Family)**
    *   Consists of a married couple and their dependent children living under one roof.
    *   Universal in all human societies.
    *   **Characteristics:** Greater burden on parents for child-rearing; more intimate husband-wife relationship.
    *   **New Family:** A subtype of nuclear family with less than 10 years duration (important for family planning studies).

2.  **[[Joint Family]]**
    *   More common in agricultural/rural areas (e.g., India, Africa).
    *   **Characteristics:**
        *   Number of married couples and their children live together in the same household.
        *   All men are related by blood; women are wives, unmarried girls, or widows.
        *   **Common Property & Purse:** Income is pooled; expenditure is met from a common fund.
        *   **Common Kitchen:** Members eat food cooked at one hearth.
        *   **Authority:** Vested in the senior male member.

3.  **[[Three Generation Family]]**
    *   Often confused with a joint family.
    *   Consists of representatives of **three generations** (Grandparents, Parents, Children) related by direct descent living together.
    *   Usually occurs when young couples continue to live with parents due to housing constraints.

4.  **Communal Family**
    *   A family where all members play a part in its management and decision-making.

5.  **[[Problem Family]]**
    *   Families that lag behind the rest of the community.
    *   **Features:** Standards of life below accepted minimum, parents unable to meet physical/emotional needs of children.
    *   **Underlying factors:** Poverty, mental instability, character defects, marital disharmony.

6.  **[[Broken Family]]**
    *   Parents have separated, or death has occurred of one or both parents.
    *   **Impact:** Causes "Mental deprivation" in children, leading to psychopathic behavior or delinquency.

### Stages of Family Cycle

Families are dynamic and pass through a biological life cycle. This is generally conceived as having **six phases**.

| Phase No. | Phase Name | Start of Phase | End of Phase |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I** | **Formation** | Marriage | Birth of 1st child |
| **II** | **Extension** | Birth of 1st child | Birth of last child |
| **III** | **Complete Extension** | Birth of last child | 1st child leaves home |
| **IV** | **Contraction** | 1st child leaves home | Last child leaves home |
| **V** | **Completed Contraction** | Last child leaves home | 1st spouse dies |
| **VI** | **Dissolution** | 1st spouse dies | Death of survivor (Extinction) |

### Role of Family in Health and Disease

The family is the primary unit of society and the *fulcrum* of health services. Its functions are deeply intertwined with the physical, mental, and social well-being of its members.

#### 1. Child Rearing and Growth
*   **Physical Care:** The family provides the biological needs (nutrition, hygiene, shelter) for the dependent young.
*   **Cultural Influence:** Child-rearing practices (feeding, sleeping, discipline) are culturally determined and transmitted through the family.
*   **Clinical Relevance:** Malnutrition or infectious diseases in children often stem from faulty child-rearing practices or family poverty.

#### 2. [[Socialization]]
*   The family bridges the gap between generations.
*   It transmits culture, beliefs, language, and codes of conduct to the young, making them fit for membership in the wider society.
*   **Impact:** Health behaviors (e.g., acceptance of immunization, personal hygiene habits) are learned during this process.

#### 3. Personality Formation
*   The family acts as a **"Placenta"**, filtering external influences.
*   Early experiences with parents determine an individual's capacity to withstand stress and interact with others.
*   **Mental Health:** A secure family environment lays the foundation for sound mental health.

#### 4. Care of Dependent Adults
*   **Sick and Injured:** The family provides frontline nursing care. Recovery is often faster at home due to emotional support.
*   **Maternal Care:** Care during pregnancy and childbirth determines maternal and infant mortality.
*   **[[Geriatric Care]]:** In traditional settings (Joint Families), the aged and handicapped receive social and economic security, which is vital for their well-being.

#### 5. Stabilization of Adult Personality
*   The family acts as a **"Shock Absorber"** for the stress and strains of life.
*   It provides a mechanism for the release of tension, maintaining mental equilibrium.
*   **Clinical Relevance:** Lack of this support (e.g., divorce, separation) contributes to mental illness, alcoholism, and suicide.

#### 6. Familial Susceptibility to Disease
Family members share a **pool of genes** and a **common environment**.
*   **Genetic/Hereditary:** Haemophilia, color blindness, diabetes, and mental illness run in families.
*   **Communicable Diseases:** Tuberculosis, scabies, common cold, and leprosy spread rapidly within the family due to shared living spaces.
*   **Environmental/Lifestyle:** Common dietary habits and stress levels in a family contribute to "lifestyle diseases" like hypertension and obesity.
