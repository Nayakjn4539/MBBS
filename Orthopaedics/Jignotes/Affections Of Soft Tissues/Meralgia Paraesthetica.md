# Meralgia Paraesthetica

### Definition
Meralgia Paraesthetica is a painful [[mononeuropathy]] of the [[lateral femoral cutaneous nerve]] (LFCN) caused by focal entrapment or compression. It is characterized by tingling, numbness, and burning pain in the anterolateral aspect of the [[thigh]].

### Functional Anatomy and Pathogenesis
*   **Nerve Origin:** The [[lateral femoral cutaneous nerve]] arises from the posterior divisions of the L2 and L3 nerve roots of the [[lumbar plexus]].
*   **Course:** It travels along the lateral border of the [[psoas muscle]], crosses the [[ilium]], and passes into the thigh.
*   **Site of Entrapment:** The nerve passes through a tunnel formed by the lateral aspect of the [[inguinal ligament]] and the [[anterior superior iliac spine]] (ASIS).
*   **Mechanism:** As the nerve passes underneath the [[inguinal ligament]], just medial to the ASIS, it is susceptible to mechanical compression or entrapment within the fascia. The nerve is purely sensory; therefore, compression results only in sensory disturbances without motor weakness.

### Etiology
The condition is often termed an "entrapment neuropathy." Causes can be categorized as mechanical or constitutional.

**Common Risk Factors:**
1.  **Tight Clothing:** Wearing tight jeans ("Skinny Jeans Syndrome"), corsets, or tight underwear.
2.  **External Compression:** Heavy belts (e.g., police belts, construction tool belts) worn around the hip.
3.  **Obesity:** A large, pendulous abdomen exerts traction on the inguinal region.
4.  **Physiological:** [[Pregnancy]] (due to increased abdominal girth and fluid retention).
5.  **Anatomical Variants:** Variations in the course of the nerve making it prone to kinking during hip extension.
6.  **Metabolic:** [[Diabetes mellitus]] or [[alcoholism]] (making the nerve more susceptible to compression).

### Clinical Features
Patients are typically middle-aged, though it can occur at any age.

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Symptoms** | • **Pain:** Burning pain, stinging, or aching.<br>• **Paraesthesia:** Numbness, tingling, or "pins and needles."<br>• **Hypersensitivity:** Unpleasant sensation when clothes rub against the thigh. |
| **Location** | Strictly limited to the **outer (lateral) side of the thigh**. It does not extend below the [[knee]]. |
| **Aggravating Factors** | • Standing erect or walking (hip extension stretches the nerve against the ligament).<br>• Tapping over the ASIS. |
| **Relieving Factors** | • Sitting (hip flexion relaxes the [[inguinal ligament]]). |

**Physical Signs:**
*   **Tenderness:** Palpation just medial to the [[anterior superior iliac spine]] (ASIS) usually elicits tenderness or reproduces the paraesthesia (Positive **Tinel’s sign** over the inguinal ligament).
*   **Sensory Deficit:** Altered sensation (hypoaesthesia or hyperaesthesia) in the distribution of the LFCN.
*   **Motor Function:** **Normal.** There is no muscle wasting or weakness (differentiates from [[lumbar disc herniation]] or [[radiculopathy]]).
*   **Reflexes:** [[Knee jerk]] is normal.

### Clinical Implications
> **Differential Diagnosis Alert:** Meralgia Paraesthetica must be distinguished from [[L2-L3 nerve root compression]] (lumbar disc prolapse). In disc prolapse, there may be motor weakness (hip flexion/knee extension) and depressed reflexes, whereas Meralgia Paraesthetica is purely sensory.

### Diagnosis
*   **Clinical Diagnosis:** Diagnosis is primarily based on history and physical examination.
*   **Pelvic Compression Test:** Deep palpation/compression of the pelvis may reproduce symptoms.
*   **Nerve Block:** Injection of [[local anesthetic]] (e.g., [[Lignocaine]]) at the site of entrapment (medial to ASIS) provides immediate relief, confirming the diagnosis.
*   **Nerve Conduction Studies:** May show delayed conduction or absent sensory potentials in the LFCN, but often difficult to perform due to patient obesity.

### Treatment
Treatment is largely non-specific and conservative.

#### 1. Conservative Management (First Line)
*   **Remove the Cause:** Avoid tight belts, tight jeans, and constrictive clothing.
*   **Weight Loss:** Reduction of abdominal obesity to relieve traction on the nerve.
*   **Medication:** 
    *   [[Analgesics]]/[[NSAIDs]] for pain relief.
    *   Neuropathic pain modulators (e.g., [[Gabapentin]], [[Pregabalin]]).
*   **Local Injection:** Infiltration of [[hydrocortisone]] (corticosteroid) and local anesthetic around the nerve near the ASIS. This is often curative.

#### 2. Surgical Management
Indicated only for intractable pain refractory to conservative measures.
*   **Surgical Decompression (Neurolysis):** Releasing the [[inguinal ligament]] and freeing the nerve from fascial entrapment.
*   **Nerve Transection:** Cutting the nerve (neurectomy) to induce permanent anesthesia in the area, trading pain for numbness.

### Mnemonics
**Causes of Meralgia Paraesthetica (The 4 T's):**
*   **T**ight clothing (Jeans/Corsets)
*   **T**ool belts (Police/Construction)
*   **T**runk obesity (Large abdomen)
*   **T**hird trimester (Pregnancy)
