# Anatomy and Physiology of the Lacrimal Apparatus

The [[Lacrimal Apparatus]] consists of two main divisions:
1.  **Secretory System:** Produces tears (Lacrimal glands and accessory glands).
2.  **Excretory (Drainage) System:** Drains tears from the eye into the nasal cavity.

---

## I. The Secretory System

### 1. Main Lacrimal Gland
It is an almond-shaped serous gland located in the **lacrimal fossa** on the anterolateral aspect of the roof of the orbit (frontal bone). It is divided into two parts by the lateral horn of the aponeurosis of the [[Levator Palpebral Superioris]] (LPS) muscle.

| Feature | **Orbital Part** (Superior) | **Palpebral Part** (Inferior) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Size** | Larger (almond size) | Smaller (one-third size of orbital) |
| **Location** | Lies above the LPS aponeurosis | Lies below the LPS aponeurosis |
| **Ducts** | Ducts pass through the palpebral part | Contains 10–12 ducts that open into the lateral part of the **superior fornix** |

**Clinical Implication:**
*   **Surgical Note:** Removal of the palpebral part effectively cuts off the drainage of the entire gland because the ducts from the orbital part pass through the palpebral part to reach the conjunctival sac.
*   **Palpation:** The palpebral lobe can be seen/palpated in the upper-outer fornix when the upper lid is everted.

### 2. Accessory Lacrimal Glands
These are responsible for **basal tear secretion** (maintaining moisture normally), while the main gland handles reflex secretion (crying/irritation).

*   **[[Glands of Krause]]:** Located in the conjunctival fornices. (Approx. 42 in upper fornix, 8 in lower fornix).
*   **[[Glands of Wolfring]]:** Located along the upper border of the superior [[tarsal plate]] and lower border of the inferior tarsus.

### 3. Nerve Supply of Lacrimal Gland
*   **Sensory:** [[Lacrimal Nerve]] (Branch of Ophthalmic division of [[Trigeminal Nerve]] - CN V).
*   **Sympathetic:** From the [[Superior Cervical Ganglion]] (via carotid plexus) → Vasoconstrictor.
*   **Parasympathetic (Secretomotor):** This controls reflex secretion.
    *   **Nucleus:** [[Superior Salivatory Nucleus]] (Pons).
    *   **Nerve:** [[Nervus Intermedius]] of [[Facial Nerve]] (CN VII) → Greater Superficial Petrosal Nerve.
    *   **Relay:** **[[Pterygopalatine Ganglion]]** (Sphenopalatine ganglion).
    *   **Post-ganglionic:** Fibers travel via the [[Zygomatic Nerve]] (CN V2) → Zygomaticotemporal nerve → Lacrimal nerve → Gland.

## II. Physiology of The Tear Film

The pre-corneal [[Tear Film]] is a thin fluid layer (7-10 $\mu$m thick) covering the corneal and conjunctival epithelium. It is essential for optical clarity and ocular health.

### Structure of Tear Film
Classically described as a **three-layered structure** (Outer to Inner):

| Layer | Thickness | Source (Glands) | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Lipid Layer]]** (Superficial) | 0.1 $\mu$m | • **[[Meibomian glands]]** (Main)<br>• [[Glands of Zeis]]<br>• [[Glands of Moll]] | • Prevents evaporation of tears.<br>• Lubricates eyelids.<br>• Increases surface tension. |
| **[[Aqueous Layer]]** (Middle) | 7.0 $\mu$m (Bulk) | • **Main [[Lacrimal Gland]]**<br>• Accessory glands ([[Krause]] & [[Wolfring]]) | • Supplies Oxygen (cornea is avascular).<br>• Antimicrobial (Lysozyme, Lactoferrin, IgA).<br>• Washes away debris. |
| **[[Mucin Layer]]** (Innermost) | 0.2 $\mu$m | • **[[Goblet Cells]]** (Conjunctiva)<br>• [[Crypts of Henle]]<br>• [[Glands of Manz]] | • Converts hydrophobic corneal surface to **hydrophilic** (wettable).<br>• Anchors tear film to epithelium via microvilli. |

### Physical Properties of Tears
*   **Volume:** ~7 $\mu$L in the conjunctival sac.
*   **pH:** 7.2 to 7.4 (slightly alkaline).
*   **Refractive Index:** 1.336.
*   **Rate of Secretion:** ~1.2 $\mu$L/minute.
*   **Composition:** 98-99% water, 1% solids (Na+, K+, Cl-, Proteins, Enzymes).

**Clinical Implication:**
*   **[[Dry Eye Syndrome]] ([[Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca]]):** Can be due to aqueous deficiency (Sjogren's), Mucin deficiency (Vitamin A deficiency/Chemical burns), or Lipid deficiency (Blepharitis).
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   **[[Schirmer's Test]]:** Measures aqueous production. Normal > 15mm in 5 min.
    *   **[[Tear Break Up Time]] (TBUT):** Measures mucin/lipid stability. Normal > 15-35 sec; < 10 sec is abnormal.

## III. The Excretory (Drainage) System

Tears drain from the conjunctival sac into the nasal cavity via the following structures:

### 1. [[Lacrimal Puncta]]
*   Small openings located on the lid margins (papilla) near the medial canthus.
*   They dip into the **Lacus Lacrimalis** (tear lake).
*   **Anatomy:** The upper punctum is situated slightly medial to the lower punctum.

### 2. [[Lacrimal Canaliculi]]
*   Connect puncta to the lacrimal sac.
*   **Course:**
    *   **Vertical part:** 2 mm.
    *   **Horizontal part:** 8 mm.
*   The superior and inferior canaliculi usually join to form a **Common Canaliculus** before entering the sac.
*   **[[Valve of Rosenmuller]]:** A mucosal fold preventing reflux from the sac into the canaliculi.

### 3. [[Lacrimal Sac]]
*   **Location:** In the **lacrimal fossa** formed by the lacrimal bone and frontal process of the maxilla.
*   **Size:** ~12–15 mm length.
*   **Parts:** Fundus (above the opening of canaliculi), Body, and Neck.
*   Enclosed by **Lacrimal Fascia** (periorbita).

### 4. [[Nasolacrimal Duct]] (NLD)
*   **Length:** 15–18 mm.
*   **Direction:** Downwards, Backwards, and Laterally.
*   **Opening:** Opens into the **[[Inferior Meatus]]** of the nose.
*   **[[Valve of Hasner]]:** A mucosal fold at the lower end of the NLD guarding the opening.

**Clinical Implication:**
*   **[[Congenital Dacryocystitis]]:** Often caused by the non-canalization (imperforate) **Valve of Hasner**.
*   **[[Epiphora]]:** Watering due to obstruction.
*   **[[Dacryocystorhinostomy]] (DCR):** Surgery creating a fistula between the lacrimal sac and the **Middle Meatus** (bypassing the NLD).

## IV. Physiology of Tear Drainage (Lacrimal Pump)

Drainage is an active process dependent on the **[[Orbicularis Oculi]]** muscle (specifically **Horner's muscle**).

**Mechanism (Jones Lacrimal Pump Theory):**
1.  **Eye Closing (Blink):**
    *   Orbicularis contracts.
    *   Puncta move medially and close.
    *   Lacrimal sac is expanded (distended) by the pull of Horner's muscle.
    *   **Negative pressure** is created in the sac, sucking tears from the canaliculi into the sac.
2.  **Eye Opening:**
    *   Orbicularis relaxes.
    *   Sac collapses (elastic recoil).
    *   **Positive pressure** forces tears down the NLD into the nose (gravity also assists).

**Clinical Implication:**
*   **Facial Palsy (CN VII):** Causes [[Lagophthalmos]] and failure of the lacrimal pump, leading to epiphora even if the duct is patent.

## V. Investigations for Watering Eye

1.  **Regurgitation Test:** Pressure over the lacrimal sac area. Reflux of mucopus indicates [[Dacryocystitis]].
2.  **Lacrimal Syringing:** Saline injected via punctum.
    *   Fluid in nose/throat = Patent.
    *   Regurgitation from same punctum = Canalicular block.
    *   Regurgitation from opposite punctum = NLD block (or common canalicular).
3.  **[[Jones Dye Test]]:** Differentiates partial obstruction vs. hypersecretion.
    *   **Jones I:** Fluorescein in eye -> check nose. Positive (dye in nose) = Patent. Negative = Obstruction or Pump failure.
    *   **Jones II:** If Jones I is negative, wash out dye. Saline in nose with dye = Functional block/Pump failure. Clear saline = Stenosis.
4.  **Dacryocystography (DCG):** Radiopaque dye imaging.
