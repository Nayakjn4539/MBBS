# Branch Retinal Artery Occlusion (BRAO)

### Definition
**Branch Retinal Artery Occlusion (BRAO)** is a vascular disorder characterized by the obstruction of a specific branch of the [[central retinal artery]], leading to ischemia and subsequent edema of the retina distal to the occlusion,. It accounts for approximately 35% of retinal artery occlusions.

### Etiology and Risk Factors
The obstruction is usually caused by an [[embolus]] lodging at a bifurcation of the retinal arteries,.

**1. Emboli (Most Common Cause)**
*   **[[Cholesterol emboli]] (Hollenhorst plaques):** Refractile, orange/yellow plaques usually arising from atheromas in the [[carotid artery]],.
*   **[[Calcium emboli]]:** White, non-refractile emboli arising from cardiac valves.
*   **[[Platelet-fibrin emboli]]:** Dull white emboli arising from atheromas in the carotid artery.

**2. Other Causes**
*   **[[Atherosclerosis]]:** Thrombosis occurring at the level of the bifurcation.
*   **[[Giant cell arteritis]]:** Should be considered in elderly patients.
*   **Vasospastic diseases:** [[Retinal migraine]] or angiospasm.
*   **Hypercoagulable states:** [[Thrombophilia]], oral contraceptives, polycythemia.
*   **Periarteritis:** Associated with conditions like [[SLE]] or [[polyarteritis nodosa]].

### Pathogenesis
1.  **Lodgement:** An embolus travels through the central retinal artery and lodges at a bifurcation where the vessel lumen narrows.
2.  **Ischemia:** The retina distal to the blockage is deprived of blood supply.
3.  **Edema:** The ischemic retina becomes oedematous and opaque (milky white).
4.  **Atrophy:** Over time (4–6 weeks), the edema resolves, leaving behind retinal atrophy and a permanent [[visual field defect]].

### Clinical Features

**Symptoms**
*   **Sudden painless loss of vision:** Only if the occlusion involves a branch supplying the [[macula]],.
*   **Field Defect:** Patients often complain of a curtain or shadow over a specific sector of their vision (corresponding to the blocked vessel).
*   **Transient Visual Loss:** History of [[amaurosis fugax]] may be present.

**Signs (Fundoscopy)**
*   **Retinal Opacification:** The retina distal to the occlusion appears milky white due to ischemic edema.
*   **Attenuated Arterioles:** The involved arterial branch is narrowed/thread-like,.
*   **Visible Embolus:** A white or yellow plaque (embolus) may be visible at the bifurcation of the artery,.
*   **Sectoral Involvement:** Unlike [[Central Retinal Artery Occlusion]] (CRAO), only a specific quadrant or sector is affected. The **superotemporal branch** is the most commonly affected site.
*   **Late Signs:** The affected area becomes atrophic, and the vessel may appear as a white thread.

### Visual Field Defects
*   **Sector-shaped defect:** The defect corresponds to the area of the retina perfused by the occluded vessel.
*   **Altitudinal defect:** If a major superior or inferior branch is occluded.
*   Initially, the [[scotoma]] may be indefinite but later becomes permanent and absolute.

### Diagnosis and Investigations
1.  **Fundoscopy:** Diagnostic in acute stages (Retinal whitening in a sector).
2.  **[[Fundus Fluorescein Angiography]] (FFA):**
    *   Shows delayed arterial filling in the affected branch.
    *   Shows masking of choroidal fluorescence due to retinal edema in the acute phase.
3.  **Systemic Workup:** Essential to find the source of emboli.
    *   **Carotid Doppler/Duplex:** To rule out carotid stenosis/plaques.
    *   **Echocardiography (Echo):** To rule out valvular vegetation or cardiac thrombus.
    *   **ESR/CRP:** To rule out [[Giant cell arteritis]] in elderly patients.
    *   **Blood Profile:** Lipid profile, blood sugar, and coagulation profile.

### Management
The retinal tissue cannot survive ischemia for more than 90–100 minutes; however, treatment is often unsatisfactory.

**Acute Ocular Management**
*   **Ocular Massage:** Intermittent massage to lower [[intraocular pressure]] (IOP) and potentially dislodge the embolus to a more peripheral vessel,.
*   **IOP Reduction:**
    *   Intravenous [[acetazolamide]] (500 mg).
    *   Intravenous [[mannitol]].
    *   [[Anterior chamber paracentesis]],.
*   **Vasodilators:** Sublingual nitroglycerine or inhalation of Carbogen (5% CO2 + 95% O2) to relieve angiospasm and improve perfusion.
*   **Laser Photodisruption:** Rarely used to disrupt the embolus (YAG laser).

**Systemic Management**
*   Treat underlying causes (e.g., carotid endarterectomy for stenosis, anticoagulants for cardiac causes) to prevent stroke or further ocular events.

### Prognosis
*   **Visual Acuity:** Generally better than CRAO. If the macula is spared, central vision remains good.
*   **Visual Field:** The sectoral field defect is usually permanent.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Stroke Risk:** BRAO is a warning sign for systemic vascular disease. Patients have a higher risk of [[cerebrovascular accidents]] (stroke) and [[myocardial infarction]].
*   **Differential Diagnosis:** Must be distinguished from [[branch retinal vein occlusion]] (BRVO), which presents with hemorrhages rather than pallor,.
