# B-Scan Ultrasonography (Brightness Scan)

**B-Scan Ultrasonography** (USG) is a non-invasive diagnostic imaging tool that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce a two-dimensional, cross-sectional view of the eye and orbit. It is essential for evaluating the posterior segment when the media is hazy or opaque.

### Principle and Physics
*   **Mechanism:** Based on the **pulse-echo technique**.
*   **Piezo-electric Effect:** The transducer converts mechanical vibrations (echoes) into electric potentials.
*   **Frequency:** Ophthalmic USG typically uses frequencies in the range of **10 MHz**.
    *   *Note:* Higher frequencies (e.g., [[Ultrasound Biomicroscopy]] or UBM at 50-80 MHz) are used for anterior segment imaging but have less penetration.
*   **Display Mode:** 
    *   Echoes are displayed as **dots** rather than spikes (as in [[A-Scan]]).
    *   The **brightness** of the dot corresponds to the intensity (amplitude) of the returning echo.
    *   The transducer moves in an arc (linear or sector scanning) to build a **2D grey-scale** acoustic section.

### Indications
[[B-Scan]] is primarily indicated when ophthalmoscopy is not possible or insufficient.

1.  **Opaque Media:** Evaluation of the posterior segment (Retina and Vitreous) in the presence of:
    *   Dense [[Cataract]].
    *   [[Corneal Opacity]].
    *   [[Vitreous Hemorrhage]].
    *   [[Hyphema]].
2.  **Trauma:**
    *   Localization of [[Intraocular Foreign Body]] (IOFB).
    *   Evaluation of **Globe Rupture**.
    *   Detection of [[Retinal Detachment]] (RD) or [[Choroidal Detachment]] after trauma.
3.  **Tumors:**
    *   Diagnosis and measurement of intraocular masses like [[Retinoblastoma]] and [[Choroidal Melanoma]].
    *   Differentiation of tumors from cysts or hemorrhages.
4.  **Orbital Diseases:**
    *   Evaluation of [[Proptosis]].
    *   Optic nerve evaluation (e.g., optic nerve sheath widening).
    *   Orbital cysts and masses.

### Interpretation of Findings

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a schematic of a B-Scan sector showing the lens, vitreous cavity, and retina. Label normal findings (black vitreous, white retina) and pathological findings (membranes, masses).

#### 1. Normal Eye Findings
*   **Vitreous:** Appears **hypoechoic** or **anechoic** (black) because it is acoustically homogeneous.
*   **Retina and Sclera:** Appear **hyperechoic** (bright white) due to high reflectivity.
*   **Lens:** Anterior and posterior capsules appear as concave/convex lines; the clear cortex/nucleus is anechoic.

#### 2. Pathological Findings

| Pathology | B-Scan Appearance/Features | Clinical Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Retinal Detachment]] (RD)** | High-reflectivity membrane; In total RD, appears as a **funnel-shaped** membrane attached at the [[Optic Disc]] and [[Ora Serrata]]. | Differentiates RD from vitreous membranes. |
| **[[Posterior Vitreous Detachment]] (PVD)** | Low-reflectivity, mobile membrane; Point-like echoes in the gel or retrohyaloid space. | Differentiates from RD; PVD is usually highly mobile on dynamic testing (eye movement). |
| **[[Vitreous Hemorrhage]] (VH)** | **Fresh:** Scattered point-like echoes of varying amplitude. <br> **Sedimented:** Flat sheet of high-amplitude echoes. | Helps rule out underlying RD or tumors in opaque media. |
| **[[Retinoblastoma]]** | Solid mass with high internal reflectivity. **Intralesional calcification** causes acoustic shadowing. | **V-Y pattern** or **W-pattern** is characteristic. |
| **[[Choroidal Melanoma]]** | Dome-shaped or **Mushroom/Collar-stud** configuration. Shows **Acoustic Hollowing** and **Choroidal Excavation**. | Differentiates from choroidal detachment or hemangioma. |
| **[[Posterior Staphyloma]]** | Outpouching/ectasia of the posterior scleral wall. | Common in pathological [[Myopia]]. |
| **[[Intraocular Foreign Body]] (IOFB)** | Highly reflective signal with strong acoustic shadowing behind it. | Crucial for localization before surgical removal. |
| **[[Asteroid Hyalosis]]** | Multiple, discrete, highly reflective mobile point echoes ("Starry night" appearance) in the vitreous. | Distinct from hemorrhage; usually unilateral and asymptomatic. |

### Comparison: A-Scan vs. B-Scan

| Feature | [[A-Scan]] (Time Amplitude) | [[B-Scan]] (Intensity Modulation) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dimension** | One-dimensional (1D) | Two-dimensional (2D) |
| **Display** | Spikes (vertical deflections) | Dots (brightness varies with echo intensity) |
| **Primary Use** | **Biometry** (measuring axial length for [[IOL]] power calculation) | **Diagnostic** imaging (visualizing pathology, structure, and topography) |
| **Analysis** | Quantitative (measurements) | Qualitative and Quantitative (morphology) |
