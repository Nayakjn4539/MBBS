# Cricothyrotomy (Laryngotomy / Coniotomy / Mini-tracheostomy)

### Definition and Overview
[[Cricothyrotomy]], also known as **Laryngotomy**, **Coniotomy**, or **Mini-tracheostomy**, is an emergency surgical procedure used to secure the airway,. It involves creating an opening through the [[cricothyroid membrane]] to establish ventilation.
*   It is generally faster and simpler than a standard [[Tracheostomy]] because the membrane is superficial, easily palpable, and the area is relatively avascular,.
*   It is primarily a temporary measure to "buy time" and should be converted to a formal tracheostomy as soon as possible,.

### Relevant Anatomy
*   **Location:** The procedure targets the [[cricothyroid membrane]] (median cricothyroid ligament), which connects the [[thyroid cartilage]] superiorly and the [[cricoid cartilage]] inferiorly.
*   **Landmarks:**
    *   **Superiorly:** The inferior border of the thyroid lamina (Adam's apple).
    *   **Inferiorly:** The upper border of the cricoid cartilage (the only complete ring of the airway),.
    *   The membrane is palpable as a depression between these two cartilaginous structures in the midline of the neck.
*   **Structure:** The cricothyroid membrane is the anterior thickening of the [[conus elasticus]].

### Indications
This procedure is the final step in the difficult airway algorithm, specifically the **CICO** scenario (**C**an't **I**ntubate, **C**an't **O**xygenate).
*   **Maxillofacial injuries:** Severe trauma where oral or nasal intubation is impossible.
*   **Cervical spine injuries:** Where neck extension required for intubation is contraindicated,.
*   **Foreign body obstruction:** Impacted in the glottis.
*   **Profuse oral hemorrhage or emesis:** Preventing visualization of vocal cords.
*   **Anatomical abnormalities:** Preventing endotracheal intubation.
*   **Severe Glottic Edema/Anaphylaxis**.

### Contraindications
*   **Absolute:**
    *   **Infants and Children (< 12 years):** Due to the high risk of [[subglottic stenosis]] and damage to the cricoid cartilage,.
*   **Relative:**
    *   Laryngeal fracture or trauma (tracheostomy is preferred if the larynx is crushed),.
    *   Laryngeal tumors or acute inflammation.

### Surgical Techniques

#### 1. Surgical Cricothyrotomy (Stab Technique)
*   **Position:** Patient is supine with the neck extended (Rose’s position) to bring the trachea anteriorly, unless there is a cervical spine injury,.
*   **Anesthesia:** Local infiltration (Lignocaine) if the patient is conscious,.
*   **Incision:**
    *   **Skin:** A **vertical incision** is preferred in the midline to minimize bleeding,,.
    *   **Membrane:** A **transverse incision** is made through the cricothyroid membrane to enter the subglottic larynx,.
*   **Dilation:** The airway is opened using a [[Tracheal dilator]], or by inserting the handle of the scalpel and rotating it 90 degrees,.
*   **Tube Insertion:** A small tracheostomy tube (size 4–5) or a dedicated cricothyrotomy tube is inserted. If unavailable, a small endotracheal tube can be used.

#### 2. Needle Cricothyrotomy (Percutaneous)
*   Used for **Transtracheal Jet Ventilation**.
*   **Procedure:**
    *   A large-bore IV cannula (12–14 Gauge) attached to a syringe (half-filled with saline) is inserted through the membrane,.
    *   Aspiration of air bubbles through the saline confirms intratracheal placement,.
    *   The cannula is connected to a high-pressure oxygen source (Jet ventilation),.
*   **Limitation:** It allows for oxygenation but inadequate ventilation (CO2 retention occurs). It is only viable for approximately 45 minutes.

### Complications
Complications are often due to the emergency nature of the procedure and anatomical proximity to the vocal cords and cricoid.

*   **Immediate:**
    *   **Hemorrhage:** Though less than tracheostomy, bleeding can occur.
    *   **Esophageal injury:** Perforation of the posterior tracheal wall.
    *   **Subcutaneous Emphysema:** If expiration is obstructed or skin is sutured tightly.
*   **Long-term:**
    *   **[[Subglottic Stenosis]]:** This is the most significant complication. It occurs due to perichondritis of the [[cricoid cartilage]] or scar tissue formation in the subglottis,,.
    *   **Voice changes:** Due to proximity to the vocal cords.

### Clinical Implications and Management
*   **Temporary Measure:** Cricothyrotomy is not a permanent airway solution.
*   **Conversion Rule:** The tube must be removed and converted to a formal **[[Tracheostomy]]** as early as possible, ideally within **48–72 hours**,,.
    *   *Reason:* Prolonged presence of a tube through the cricothyroid membrane causes friction against the cricoid cartilage, leading to perichondritis and subsequent subglottic stenosis,.
*   **Mnemonic for Indications (CICO):**
    *   **C**an't Intubate
    *   **I**njury to Face/Spine
    *   **C**an't Oxygenate
    *   **O**bstruction (Foreign Body)
