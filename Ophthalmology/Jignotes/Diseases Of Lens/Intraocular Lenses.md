# [[Diseases Of Lens]] > Intraocular Lenses

### Intraocular Lenses (IOLs)

[[Intraocular Lens]] (IOL) implantation is the standard method for optical rehabilitation following [[Cataract]] surgery. An IOL is a synthetic lens implanted in the eye to replace the natural crystalline lens (Aphakia) or to correct refractive errors in a phakic eye.

**Historical Note:** The first IOL was implanted by **Sir Harold Ridley** on November 29, 1949, at St. Thomas Hospital, London.

### I. Structure and Power Calculation

#### 1. Parts of an IOL
*   **Optic:** The central refractive element (usually 5.5–6.0 mm in diameter).
*   **Haptics:** The peripheral arms or loops (C-shaped, J-shaped, or plate) that provide fixation and stability within the capsular bag or ciliary sulcus.
*   > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw an IOL showing the central Optic and peripheral Haptics

#### 2. Biometry (IOL Power Calculation)
The power of the IOL is calculated pre-operatively to achieve the desired postoperative refraction (usually emmetropia).
*   **SRK Formula (Regression Formula):**
    $$P = A - 2.5L - 0.9K$$
    *   **P:** Power of IOL in Diopters (D).
    *   **A:** A-constant (Specific to the lens design/manufacturer).
    *   **L:** [[Axial Length]] of the eyeball (measured by [[A-scan ultrasonography]] or Optical Biometry).
    *   **K:** Average Corneal Curvature (measured by [[Keratometry]]).
*   **Newer Formulas:** SRK-T, Holladay, Hoffer-Q, Haigis, and Barrett Universal II (better for extremes of axial length).

### II. Classification Based on Material

| Material Type | Examples | Features | Merits | Demerits |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rigid (Non-foldable)** | **[[Polymethyl methacrylate]] (PMMA)** | The original material. Hydrophobic, inert, hard. | • Excellent biocompatibility.<br>• Cheap.<br>• Stable optics. | • Requires large incision (5.5–6.0 mm) $\rightarrow$ Suture required $\rightarrow$ Astigmatism.<br>• Pitting by [[Nd:YAG laser]]. |
| **Foldable (Soft)** | **[[Hydrophobic Acrylic]]** | Most popular. Low water content. | • Implanted through small incision (2.2–3.2 mm).<br>• Controlled unfolding.<br>• **Less PCO (Posterior Capsular Opacification)** due to bio-adhesion. | • **Glistenings** (fluid-filled microvacuoles) may develop over time. |
| | **[[Hydrophilic Acrylic]]** | High water content (Hydrogel). | • High biocompatibility.<br>• No glistenings. | • Higher rate of PCO compared to hydrophobic acrylic.<br>• Risk of calcification. |
| | **[[Silicone]]** | Elastomer. | • Very rapid unfolding.<br>• Requires smallest incision. | • **Contraindicated** if silicone oil tamponade is expected (oil adheres to lens).<br>• More capsular contraction. |
| **Rollable** | **Hydrogel** | Ultra-thin. | • Implanted through Micro-incision (< 2 mm). | • Stability issues in some early models. |

### III. Classification Based on Location of Implantation

#### 1. Posterior Chamber IOL (PC-IOL)
*   **Site:** Ideally placed in the **Capsular Bag** (In-the-bag). Can be placed in the **Ciliary Sulcus** if the posterior capsule is ruptured but anterior rim support is present.
*   **Indications:** Routine [[Extracapsular Cataract Extraction]] (ECCE) or [[Phacoemulsification]].
*   **Merits:**
    *   Most physiological position (near the nodal point).
    *   Least magnification/minification effects.
    *   Reduced risk of corneal endothelial damage or glaucoma compared to AC-IOLs.

#### 2. Anterior Chamber IOL (AC-IOL)
*   **Site:** Placed in the anterior chamber, supported by the scleral spur/angle structures.
*   **Design:** Usually Kelman Multiflex (flexible open-loop) to reduce tenderness.
*   **Indications:**
    *   Surgical complications like [[Posterior Capsular Rupture]] (PCR) with insufficient support for sulcus fixation.
    *   Secondary implantation after [[Intracapsular Cataract Extraction]] (ICCE).
*   **Demerits:**
    *   **[[Bullous Keratopathy]]:** Due to endothelial damage.
    *   **UGH Syndrome:** Uveitis-Glaucoma-Hyphema syndrome.
    *   Peripheral Anterior Synechiae (PAS).
    *   Pupil ovalization.

#### 3. Iris-Supported/Fixated Lenses
*   **Type:** Iris Claw Lens (e.g., Singh-Worst lens).
*   **Site:** Fixated to the mid-peripheral iris stroma. Can be placed prepupillary (AC) or retropupillary (PC).
*   **Merits:** Useful in aphakia with no capsular support. One size fits all (no need to measure white-to-white diameter).

#### 4. Scleral Fixated IOL (SFIOL)
*   **Site:** Sutured or glued (fibrin glue) to the sclera.
*   **Indications:** Absence of capsular and iris support (e.g., extensive trauma, Marfan's syndrome with subluxation).
*   **Technique:** Glued IOL (Agarwal’s technique) or Sutured (using 10-0 Prolene).

### IV. Classification Based on Optical Properties

#### 1. Monofocal IOLs
*   **Function:** Focuses light at a single distance (usually set for far vision).
*   **Merit:** Excellent contrast sensitivity; no halos. Cheapest option.
*   **Demerit:** Patient requires spectacles for near vision ([[Presbyopia]]) and intermediate work.

#### 2. Multifocal IOLs (Presbyopia-Correcting)
*   **Function:** Provides simultaneous vision for distance and near (and intermediate).
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   *Diffractive:* Steps/rings on the optic surface create wave interference.
    *   *Refractive:* Concentric zones of different powers (Bull's eye).
*   **Merits:** Spectacle independence.
*   **Demerits:**
    *   Reduced **Contrast Sensitivity**.
    *   Photic phenomena: **Glare** and **Halos** (especially at night).
    *   Requires neuro-adaptation.

#### 3. Toric IOLs
*   **Function:** Corrects pre-existing corneal [[Astigmatism]].
*   **Mechanism:** Has cylindrical power in a specific meridian.
*   **Requirement:** Precise axis alignment is crucial. Rotation reduces efficacy.
*   [[Clinical Implication]]: Standard spherical IOLs do not correct astigmatism. Toric IOLs are indicated if astigmatism is > 1.0 - 1.5 D.

#### 4. Accommodative IOLs
*   **Function:** Mimics natural accommodation by changing position (moving forward) or shape within the eye upon ciliary muscle contraction.
*   **Example:** Crystalens.
*   **Merit:** Pseudo-accommodation without the dysphotopsia (halos) of multifocals.

#### 5. Extended Depth of Focus (EDOF) IOLs
*   **Function:** Creates an elongated focal point rather than distinct focal points.
*   **Merit:** Good intermediate vision (computer work) and distance vision; less glare than multifocals.
*   **Example:** Tecnis Symfony.

### V. Specialized IOLs

#### 1. Phakic IOLs (Implantable Collamer Lens - ICL)
*   **Definition:** Implantation of an IOL *without* removing the natural crystalline lens.
*   **Material:** **Collamer** (Collagen + Polymer) – highly biocompatible.
*   **Indication:** High [[Myopia]] (> -8D to -20D) or Hypermetropia where [[LASIK]]/PRK is contraindicated (e.g., thin cornea).
*   **Site:** Posterior chamber (Sulcus) behind the iris and in front of the natural lens.
*   **Complications:** Cataract formation (if it touches the natural lens), Pigment dispersion, Secondary Glaucoma.

#### 2. Aspheric IOLs
*   **Function:** Modified surface curvature to neutralize the positive spherical aberration of the cornea.
*   **Benefit:** Improved contrast sensitivity and image quality, especially in dim light (mesopic conditions).

#### 3. Aniridia IOLs
*   **Design:** IOL with an opaque artificial iris diaphragm.
*   **Indication:** [[Aniridia]] (congenital or traumatic) to reduce glare and photophobia.

#### 4. Blue-Light Filtering IOLs
*   **Design:** Yellow-tinted chromophore.
*   **Theory:** Filters short-wavelength blue light to potentially protect the [[Macula]] (ARMD protection), mimicking the natural adult lens.

### VI. IOL Complications (Specific Syndromes)

1.  **Sunset Syndrome:** Inferior subluxation of the IOL (looks like a setting sun).
2.  **Sunrise Syndrome:** Superior subluxation of the IOL.
3.  **Lost Lens Syndrome:** Complete dislocation of the IOL into the [[Vitreous]].
4.  **Windshield Wiper Syndrome:** Occurs when a small IOL is placed in the sulcus; the lens moves side-to-side with head movements.
5.  **Toxic Lens Syndrome:** Uveal inflammation caused by sterilization residue (ethylene oxide) or polishing compounds on the IOL.
6.  **UGH Syndrome:** Uveitis-Glaucoma-Hyphema (classic with rigid AC-IOLs rubbing against the iris).
