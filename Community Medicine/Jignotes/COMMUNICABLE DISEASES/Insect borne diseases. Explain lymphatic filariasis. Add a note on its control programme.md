# **[[Lymphatic Filariasis]] (Elephantiasis)**

**Lymphatic Filariasis** is a vector-borne parasitic disease that affects the lymphatic system, leading to abnormal enlargement of body parts, pain, and severe disability. It is a major public health problem in India, often associated with poverty, poor sanitation, and urbanization,.

### **1. Epidemiological Determinants**

| **Component** | **Details** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Agent** | Caused by nematode worms:<br>1. **_[[Wuchereria bancrofti]]_** (Responsible for **95-99%** of cases in India),.<br>2. _Brugia malayi_<br>3. _Brugia timori_ |
| **Vector** | **Culex quinquefasciatus** (_C. fatigans_): Transmits Bancroftian filariasis. Breeds in **dirty/polluted water**.<br>**Mansonia** species (*M. annulifera*): Transmits Brugian filariasis. Associated with aquatic plant *Pistia stratiotes*. |
| **Host** | **Man** is the Definitive Host.<br>**Mosquito** is the Intermediate Host. |
| **Mode of Transmission** | Bite of infected vector mosquito depositing **L3 larvae** (Infective stage). |
| **Incubation Period** | **Clinical IP:** 8–16 months.<br>**Pre-patent period** (time to detectable microfilariae): ~1 year. |

### **2. Life Cycle**

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw the life cycle of Wuchereria bancrofti showing the cycle in Man (Definitive host) and Mosquito (Intermediate host). Highlight the L3 larva entering human skin and Microfilariae entering the mosquito.

*   **Periodicity:** The microfilariae (Mf) exhibit **Nocturnal Periodicity**, meaning they appear in peripheral blood at night (10 PM – 2 AM) to match the biting habits of the vector.

> **Mnemonic for Vectors:**
> *   **WC:** **W**uchereria = **C**ulex (Breeds in Dirty Water/Water Closet).
> *   **BM:** **B**rugia = **M**ansonia.

### **3. Clinical Manifestations**

The disease spectrum ranges from asymptomatic infection to chronic disfigurement,:

1.  **Asymptomatic Microfilaremia:** Patient has no symptoms but blood is positive for microfilariae. They are the **reservoir of infection**.
2.  **Acute Manifestations:**
    *   **Filarial Fever:** High fever with chills.
    *   **Lymphangitis:** Inflamed lymphatic vessels (red streaks on limbs).
    *   **Lymphadenitis:** Swollen, painful lymph nodes.
    *   **Epididymo-orchitis:** Inflammation of testes/spermatic cord.
3.  **Chronic Manifestations (Obstructive Stage):**
    *   **[[Hydrocele]]:** Swelling of the scrotum (Common in *W. bancrofti*).
    *   **[[Elephantiasis]]:** Permanent swelling of legs, arms, vulva, or breast due to lymphedema and fibrosis.
    *   **Chyluria:** Milky white urine due to rupture of lymphatics into the urinary tract.
4.  **Occult Filariasis:**
    *   Hypersensitivity reaction to filarial antigens.
    *   **[[Tropical Pulmonary Eosinophilia]] (TPE):** Cough, wheezing, high eosinophil count.

> **Clinical Relevance:**
> In *Brugia malayi* infection, the swelling is usually restricted to the leg **below the knee**, whereas *W. bancrofti* can affect the entire leg and genitals.

### **4. Diagnosis**

1.  **Night Blood Survey (NBS):** Collection of 20 cu. mm blood between **8:30 PM and 12 Midnight** to detect microfilariae (Thick smear).
2.  **DEC Provocation Test:** Administering Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) during the day induces Mf to enter peripheral blood for detection.
3.  **Immunochromatographic Test (ICT):** Rapid antigen detection test.
4.  **Xenodiagnosis:** Feeding mosquitoes on patient and dissecting them later (rarely used).

### **5. Prevention and Control**

The strategy involves attacking the parasite (Chemotherapy) and the vector.

**A. Chemotherapy**
*   **Drug of Choice:** **[[Diethylcarbamazine]] (DEC)**.
*   **Dose:**
    *   *W. bancrofti:* 6 mg/kg/day for 12 days.
    *   *B. malayi:* 3–6 mg/kg/day for 6–12 days.
*   **Action:** Kills Microfilariae (microfilaricidal); limited effect on adult worms.

**B. Vector Control**
*   **Anti-larval measures:** Chemical larvicides (Temephos), biological control (Larvivorous fish like *Gambusia*), and environmental management (filling ditches, closing septic tanks).
*   **Anti-adult measures:** Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) is less effective due to resistance.
*   **Personal Prophylaxis:** Bed nets, screening of houses.

### **6. National Programme: Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (ELF)**

The **National Filaria Control Programme (NFCP)** (launched 1955) is now integrated into the **[[National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme]] (NVBDCP)**.

**Goal:** Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis as a public health problem (Target: **2027** for India),.
*   *Definition of Elimination:* Microfilaria rate **<1%** in the community.

#### **Twin-Pillar Strategy for Elimination:**

**1. Annual Mass Drug Administration (MDA)**
*   **Concept:** Administration of single-dose anti-filarial drugs to the *entire eligible population* (except pregnant women, children <2 years, and seriously ill) once a year for 5–6 years to interrupt transmission.
*   **Regimens:**
    *   **Double Drug Therapy (DA):** DEC (6 mg/kg) + Albendazole (400 mg).
    *   **Triple Drug Therapy (IDA):** **[[Ivermectin]]** + DEC + Albendazole. (Recommended by WHO and adopted in India to accelerate elimination),.
*   **Observation:** Must be **directly observed** (drug swallowed in front of health worker).

**2. Morbidity Management and Disability Prevention (MMDP)**
*   **Home-based Foot Care:** Washing limbs with soap/water, elevation, and exercise for lymphedema patients to prevent acute attacks (ADL).
*   **Hydrocelectomy:** Surgical correction of hydrocele in identified CHCs/District hospitals.

**Assessment Indicators:**
*   **Microfilaria Rate (Mf rate):** % of persons with Mf in blood.
*   **Transmission Assessment Survey (TAS):** Used to decide when to stop MDA.
