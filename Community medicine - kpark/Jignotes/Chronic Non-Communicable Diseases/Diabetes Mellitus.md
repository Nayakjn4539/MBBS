# Diabetes Mellitus

**Diabetes Mellitus** is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by [[Hyperglycaemia]] resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. It is a chronic condition that acts as a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and renal failure.

In Public Health, Diabetes is classically described as an **[[Iceberg Disease]]**, where the known cases constitute only the tip of the iceberg, while a vast number of undiagnosed (subclinical) cases remain submerged.

### Classification (WHO)

1.  **Type 1 Diabetes (Insulin-dependent):**
    *   Immune-mediated destruction of pancreatic $\beta$-cells.
    *   Absolute insulin deficiency.
    *   Usually occurs in children/young adults (Peak: 10–14 years).
    *   Prone to **Ketosis**.
2.  **Type 2 Diabetes (Non-insulin dependent):**
    *   Predominant form (>90% of cases).
    *   Characterized by **[[Insulin Resistance]]** and relative insulin deficiency.
    *   Associated with obesity and sedentary lifestyle.
    *   Slow onset, often asymptomatic.
3.  **Gestational Diabetes Mellitus ([[GDM]]):**
    *   Hyperglycemia first detected during pregnancy.
    *   Increases risk of Type 2 DM in both mother and child later in life.
4.  **Other Specific Types:**
    *   Genetic defects, diseases of exocrine pancreas, drug-induced, etc.

### Epidemiological Determinants

#### A. Agent Factors
*   **Agent:** Insulin deficiency (absolute or relative).
*   **Pathology:** Reduced utilization of glucose leads to hyperglycemia and glycosuria.
*   **Risk Factors:**
    *   **Diet:** High intake of saturated fats and sucrose; low intake of [[Dietary Fibre]].
    *   **Obesity:** Specifically **Central Adiposity** (Visceral fat). High [[Waist-Hip Ratio]] is a better predictor than BMI.
    *   **Physical Inactivity:** Sedentary lifestyle alters insulin-receptor interaction.

#### B. Host Factors
*   **Age:** Prevalence rises with age (Type 2).
*   **Sex:** Prevalence is generally equal, though slightly higher in men in some SE Asian populations.
*   **Genetics:**
    *   **Type 1:** Associated with **HLA-DR3** and **HLA-DR4**.
    *   **Type 2:** Strong familial aggregation (90% concordance in identical twins).
*   **Maternal Factors:** Intrauterine growth retardation (Low Birth Weight) followed by rapid catch-up growth increases risk.

#### C. Environmental Factors
*   **Sedentary Lifestyle:** The most important environmental trigger.
*   **Viral Infections:** Rubella, Mumps, Coxsackie B4 (implicated in Type 1).
*   **Chemical Agents:** Alloxan, Streptozotocin (toxic to beta cells).
*   **Stress:** Surgery/trauma can unmask latent diabetes.

### Clinical Picture
The classic presentation involves the **"3 Ps"**:
1.  **Polyuria** (Excessive urination)
2.  **Polydipsia** (Excessive thirst)
3.  **Polyphagia** (Excessive hunger)
*   **Other features:** Unexplained weight loss (Type 1), fatigue, delayed wound healing, blurred vision, paresthesia.
*   **Note:** Many Type 2 diabetics remain asymptomatic for years (Latent phase).

> **Mnemonic for Symptoms: "SUGAR"**
> *   **S**low wound healing
> *   **U**rination (Frequent)
> *   **G**et tired/thirsty easily
> *   **A**lways hungry
> *   **R**eduction in weight (Type 1) / Blurring of vision (Retinopathy)

### Diagnosis (WHO Criteria)

Diagnosis should not be based on a single abnormal blood value in asymptomatic patients.

| Condition | Fasting Plasma Glucose | 2-hr Post-Glucose Load (75g) | HbA1c |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Normal** | < 110 mg/dl | < 140 mg/dl | < 5.7% |
| **Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT)** | < 126 mg/dl | 140 – 199 mg/dl | 5.7 – 6.4% |
| **Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG)** | 110 – 125 mg/dl | < 140 mg/dl | - |
| **[[Diabetes Mellitus]]** | **$\ge$ 126 mg/dl** | **$\ge$ 200 mg/dl** | **$\ge$ 6.5%** |

*Note: Random Plasma Glucose $\ge$ 200 mg/dl with classic symptoms is also diagnostic.*

**Clinical Relevance:** [[Glycosylated Haemoglobin]] (HbA1c) reflects the mean blood glucose level over the previous 2–3 months. It is the gold standard for monitoring long-term control.

### Prevention and Control

#### 1. Primordial Prevention
Prevention of the emergence of risk factors in populations where they have not yet appeared.
*   **Intervention:** Maintaining normal body weight and healthy nutritional habits from childhood.
*   **Diet:** Low fat, high fiber, avoidance of sweet foods.

#### 2. Primary Prevention
Action taken prior to the onset of disease to remove the possibility of occurrence.
*   **Population Strategy:**
    *   Promote physical exercise ("Move for Health").
    *   [[Prudent Diet]]: Reduce saturated fats, increase complex carbohydrates.
    *   Maintain ideal [[Body Mass Index]] (BMI 18.5 – 22.9 for Asians).
*   **High-Risk Strategy:**
    *   Targeting groups: Age >40, Family history, Obese, Women with history of GDM or macrosomic baby (>4kg).
    *   Avoid diabetogenic drugs (e.g., steroids, OCPs).

#### 3. Secondary Prevention
Action which halts the progress of a disease at its incipient stage.
*   **Screening:** Urine sugar is **not** a sensitive test. Blood glucose testing is the method of choice.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Diet:** Small, frequent meals. Low [[Glycemic Index]] foods.
    *   **Exercise:** Increases insulin sensitivity.
    *   **Drugs:** Oral Hypoglycemic Agents (OHAs) or Insulin.
*   **Self-Care:** Patients must be educated on self-monitoring of blood glucose, foot care, and recognition of hypoglycemia.

#### 4. Tertiary Prevention
Measures to reduce or limit impairments and disabilities.
*   **Prevention of Complications:**
    *   **Blindness:** Regular fundus examination for Diabetic Retinopathy.
    *   **Renal Failure:** Monitoring microalbuminuria/creatinine for Diabetic Nephropathy.
    *   **Gangrene:** Proper **[[Foot Care]]** to prevent amputation.
*   **Rehabilitation:** For those with visual impairment or limb amputation.

### National Programme
In India, Diabetes control is integrated under **[[NP-NCD]]** (National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases).
*   **Key Strategy:** Opportunistic screening of all persons > 30 years at Sub-centers and PHCs.
*   **NCD Clinics:** Established at CHCs and District Hospitals for management.
*   **mDiabetes:** A mobile health initiative by MoHFW to increase awareness.
