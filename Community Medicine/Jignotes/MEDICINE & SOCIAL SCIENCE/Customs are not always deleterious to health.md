# [[MEDICINE & SOCIAL SCIENCE]] > Customs are not always deleterious to health

### Concept of Customs in Health
**Customs** are established patterns of behavior that can be objectively verified within a particular social setting. They are "learned behaviors" socially acquired and transmitted from one generation to another. 

It is a common misconception that all traditional beliefs and customs are harmful. In [[Social Medicine]], customs are classified into four distinct categories based on their impact on health status.

### Classification of Customs

| Category | Impact on Health | Action Required by Doctor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Good (Beneficial)** | Scientifically sound and promote health. | **Encourage** and Preserve. |
| **Bad (Harmful)** | Scientifically proved to be deleterious. | **Discourage** and Educate to change. |
| **Unimportant (Neutral)** | Neither harmful nor beneficial. | **Ignore** or leave alone. |
| **Uncertain** | Health impact is not clearly defined yet. | **Investigate** further. |

### 1. Good (Beneficial) Customs
These customs have positive values, often based on centuries of trial and error. They should be integrated into health education strategies.

*   **Maternity and Child Health:**
    *   **Prolonged Breastfeeding:** In rural India, breastfeeding is often continued for a long time. This provides nutrition and transfers [[natural immunity]] to the infant.
    *   **Oil Bath and Massage:** The traditional practice of massaging the baby with oil and exposing them to the sun helps in the synthesis of **Vitamin D** (preventing rickets) and improves circulation.
    *   **Confinement (Rest):** The custom of keeping the mother and baby in isolation (segregation) for a few weeks after birth reduces the risk of [[puerperal sepsis]] and allows the mother to rest.
    *   **Squatting position:** The traditional Indian squatting position during defecation or household work is physiotherapically beneficial for pelvic muscles, aiding in easier childbirth.

*   **Dietary Habits:**
    *   **Vegetarianism:** High intake of vegetables and low intake of meat reduces the risk of [[Coronary Heart Disease]], obesity, and certain cancers.
    *   **Turmeric and Spices:** Many Indian spices have antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties.
    *   **Hot Meals:** The preference for freshly cooked hot meals prevents bacterial growth found in stored food.

*   **Hygiene:**
    *   **Ritual Bathing:** Many religions mandate bathing before prayers or meals, promoting personal hygiene.
    *   **Washing hands and feet:** Customary washing before entering a home or before eating prevents [[fecal-oral transmission]] of diseases.

### 2. Bad (Harmful) Customs
These are the customs that act as barriers to health and must be tactfully discouraged through **IEC (Information, Education, and Communication)** activities.

*   **Dietary Taboos:**
    *   Avoiding **Papaya** during pregnancy (myth that it causes abortion).
    *   Restricting food intake during pregnancy to have a "small baby" for easier delivery (leads to [[Low Birth Weight]]).
    *   Considering pulses, eggs, and leafy vegetables as "hot" or harmful during lactation.
*   **Child Rearing:**
    *   Application of **cow dung** or mud on the [[umbilical cord]] stump (Major cause of **Neonatal Tetanus**).
    *   Branding the skin with hot iron rods to cure diseases (causes burns and sepsis).
    *   Discarding **Colostrum** (the first milk), depriving the child of essential antibodies.
*   **Social Practices:**
    *   **Open Defecation:** Leads to soil pollution and hookworm infestation (walking barefoot).
    *   **Early Marriage:** leads to teenage pregnancies, high [[Maternal Mortality Rate]], and weak infants.
    *   **Purdah System:** Can lead to Vitamin D deficiency (Osteomalacia) due to lack of sun exposure.

### 3. Unimportant (Neutral) Customs
These practices have no significant medical impact. A physician should not waste energy fighting these, as it may alienate the community.
*   **Examples:** Piercing of nose and ears (if done hygienically), wearing amulets or charms, applying *teeka* on the forehead.

### 4. Uncertain Customs
*   **Application of Kajal/Surma:** While it is traditionally applied to ward off the "evil eye" or beautify the eyes, medically it is debated. It may transmit [[Community Medicine/Jignotes/COMMUNICABLE DISEASES/Trachoma]] or lead to lead poisoning, but in some cultures, it is believed to cool the eyes. It is generally discouraged by ophthalmologists but falls under this grey area in social classification until proven strictly harmful in a specific context.

### Clinical Relevance & Management
When working in a community, a doctor must not reject all traditions as "superstition." The approach should be:
1.  **Identify:** Is the custom beneficial, harmful, or neutral?
2.  **Strategy:**
    *   If **Beneficial**: Incorporate it into your advice (e.g., "Yes, massage the baby, it makes bones strong").
    *   If **Harmful**: Do not mock. Explain the scientific logic gently. (e.g., instead of saying "Cow dung is dirty", explain "The cord needs to be dry to heal, putting anything wet on it causes infection").
    *   If **Neutral**: Let it be. It provides psychological comfort to the patient.

> **Mnemonic to Remember Classification:**
> **B**reastfeeding is **Best** (Good)
> **C**ow dung is **Cruel** (Bad)
> **P**iercing is **Passable** (Unimportant)
> **K**ajal is **Konfusing** (Uncertain)
