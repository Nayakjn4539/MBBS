# [[Legal Procedures]] > Perjury and IPC 193

### Perjury and IPC 193

**Perjury** is the act of willfully giving false evidence or fabricating false evidence by a witness while under [[oath]] or solemn affirmation in a judicial proceeding. In the context of [[Forensic Medicine]], this applies to medical officers giving testimony or issuing certificates.

#### Definition
Perjury is defined as the **willful utterance of falsehood** by a witness who is bound by an oath or by an express provision of law to state the truth, or being bound by law to make a declaration upon any subject, makes any statement which is false, and which he either knows or believes to be false or does not believe to be true.

#### Legal Sections Involved

| **Section** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[IPC 191]]** | Defines **"Giving False Evidence"**. It applies when a person legally bound by oath to state the truth makes a false statement. |
| **[[IPC 192]]** | Defines **"Fabricating False Evidence"**. Creating false circumstances or entries to mislead a public servant or court. |
| **[[IPC 193]]** | Prescribes the **Punishment** for giving or fabricating false evidence. |
| **[[IPC 197]]** | Issuing or signing a **false medical certificate**. This is considered equivalent to giving false evidence and is punishable in the same manner as IPC 193. |

#### Punishment under IPC 193
The severity of punishment depends on the nature of the proceeding where the false evidence is given.

1.  **Judicial Proceedings:**
    *   If false evidence is given during a stage of a judicial proceeding (e.g., in a Court trial).
    *   **Punishment:** Imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to **7 years** + Fine.
2.  **Other Cases:**
    *   If false evidence is given in any other case (e.g., police investigation or administrative enquiry).
    *   **Punishment:** Imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to **3 years** + Fine.

#### Medicolegal Aspects for Doctors
A doctor can be charged with perjury in the following scenarios:
*   **False Testimony:** Lying in the [[witness box]] regarding autopsy findings, injury reports, or clinical conditions to favor a particular party (Prosecution or Defense).
*   **False Certificates:** Issuing a false certificate regarding ill-health, age, death, or insanity (IPC 197). If a doctor certifies a healthy person as sick to help them evade duty or court appearance, they are liable under IPC 193.
*   **Changing Statements:** If a doctor makes two contradictory statements on oath (e.g., one during the committal proceedings and a contradictory one during the sessions trial), they can be prosecuted for perjury.

#### Hostile Witness and Perjury
*   A **[[Hostile Witness]]** is one who suppresses the truth or gives evidence against the party that called them.
*   While a hostile witness is cross-examined by their own lawyer to elicit the truth, if it is proven that they willfully lied under oath, they are liable for perjury under IPC 193.
