# [[Neurotoxic Poisons (Cns Depressants)]] > Barbiturates

### [[Barbiturates]]

**Synonyms:** Sleeping pills, goof balls, red devils, downers, yellow jackets.

[[Barbiturates]] are derivatives of barbituric acid (2,4,6-trioxohexahydropyrimidine). Once the most popular sedative-hypnotics, they have largely been replaced by [[Benzodiazepines]] due to safety profiles but remain relevant in forensic practice due to overdose and specific medical uses.

### Classification
Barbiturates are classified based on their duration of action:

| Class | Duration | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Long Acting** | 8–24 hours | Phenobarbitone (Luminal), Mephobarbitone |
| **Intermediate Acting** | 3–6 hours | Butobarbitone, Amobarbitone (Amytal) |
| **Short Acting** | < 3 hours | Pentobarbitone, Secobarbitone |
| **Ultra-short Acting** | 15–20 mins | Thiopentone (Pentothal), Methohexitone |

### Mode of Action
*   **Mechanism:** They act at the [[GABA]] receptor–chloride channel complex.
*   **Effect:** They potentiate GABAergic inhibition by increasing the **lifetime** (duration) of chloride channel opening. This depresses the activity of all excitable tissues, particularly the CNS.
*   **Metabolism:** Mostly metabolized in the liver (oxidation). Long-acting variants (Phenobarbitone) are excreted significantly unchanged by the kidney.

### Clinical Features (Acute Poisoning)
The symptoms depend on the dose and tolerance.
1.  **Early Stage:**
    *   Drowsiness, lethargy, and slurred speech.
    *   **Mental Confusion:** Ataxia, vertigo, and headache.
    *   **Nystagmus:** Often an early sign.
    *   **Paradoxical Excitement:** May occur, especially in the elderly or with small doses.
2.  **Advanced Stage (Toxic Coma):**
    *   **Deep Coma:** Loss of all reflexes (superficial and deep).
    *   **Pupils:** Initially constricted (miosis) reacting to light, but in terminal stages or severe hypoxia, they become **dilated** and fixed.
    *   **Respiration:** Shallow, slow, irregular, or Cheyne-Stokes breathing.
    *   **Hypotension:** Fall in BP and cardiac output; shock syndrome.
    *   **Hypothermia:** Body temperature usually falls.
    *   **Renal Failure:** Oliguria or suppression of urine (may contain albumin/sugar).

#### Cutaneous Signs
*   **[[Barbiturate Blisters]] (Fern-leaf pattern):**
    *   Seen in about 6% of cases.
    *   **Appearance:** Clear, erythematous, or hemorrhagic bullae.
    *   **Location:** Typically over pressure points (buttocks, knees, ankles) but can occur between fingers (interdigital clefts) or on the dorsum of hands.
    *   **Cause:** Attributed to direct toxic action on the epidermis or local pressure necrosis.

### Diagnosis
*   **EEG:** May show **Alpha Coma** (prognostically poor sign).
*   **Detection:** Blood levels, gastric lavage contents, or urine analysis.

### Fatal Dose and Period
*   **Fatal Dose:**
    *   Short-acting: 1–2 g
    *   Intermediate: 2–3 g
    *   Long-acting: 3–5 g
    *   *Note:* Blood levels >10 mg/dL for long-acting and >3 mg/dL for short-acting are generally toxic.
*   **Fatal Period:** Usually 24–48 hours (death is rarely immediate).

### Treatment
There is no specific pharmacological antidote (unlike flumazenil for benzodiazepines). Management is essentially supportive, known as the **Scandinavian Method**.

1.  **Resuscitation (ABC):** Maintain airway (intubation if comatose), assisted ventilation, and oxygen.
2.  **Gastric Decontamination:**
    *   **Gastric Lavage:** Useful if within 6–12 hours. Can use warm water with [[Potassium Permanganate]] (1:5000) or suspension of [[Activated Charcoal]].
    *   **Activated Charcoal:** Multiple doses to interrupt enterohepatic circulation.
3.  **Forced Alkaline Diuresis:**
    *   **Indication:** Effective mainly for **Long-acting Barbiturates** (e.g., Phenobarbitone) because they are weak acids and less protein-bound.
    *   **Method:** IV Sodium Bicarbonate to alkalinize urine (pH 7.5–8.0). This keeps the drug in ionized form, preventing tubular reabsorption and enhancing excretion.
    *   *Note:* Not effective for short-acting barbiturates as they are protein-bound and metabolized by the liver.
4.  **Extracorporeal Removal:** [[Haemodialysis]] or Charcoal Haemoperfusion is highly effective in severe cases (renal failure, shock).
5.  **Hypotension Management:** IV fluids (crystalloids), Dopamine/Noradrenaline if needed.
6.  **Supportive:** Antibiotics for hypostatic pneumonia, turning the patient to prevent bedsores.

### Postmortem Findings
*   **External:**
    *   Signs of [[Asphyxia]] (cyanosis, sub-pleural petechiae).
    *   **Barbiturate Blisters** on skin (pressure points).
    *   Froth at mouth/nose.
*   **Internal:**
    *   **Stomach:** May contain white/capsule residue; mucosa may be congested or show hemorrhagic blistering.
    *   **Lungs:** Congested, edematous (pulmonary edema), or signs of bronchopneumonia (delayed death).
    *   **Brain/Viscera:** Congested.

### Medicolegal Aspects

1.  **Suicide:** Most common manner of death. It is a painless way to die ("ideal suicidal poison").
2.  **Accidental:** Common in addicts or children.
3.  **[[Barbiturate Automatism]] (Drug Automatism):**
    *   A condition where a person, usually suffering from insomnia or anxiety, takes a dose of barbiturate but fails to get sleep immediately.
    *   Due to drug-induced confusion/amnesia (or anterograde amnesia), they forget having taken the dose and ingest more.
    *   This cycle repeats until a fatal overdose occurs. It is **not** a deliberate suicide.
4.  **Truth Serum:**
    *   **Thiopentone Sodium** (Pentothal) or **Sodium Amytal** are used for **[[Narcoanalysis]]**.
    *   They lower inhibitions and make the subject talkative (though not necessarily truthful).
5.  **Euthanasia/Execution:** High doses of Thiopentone are used for lethal injection (judicial execution) or physician-assisted suicide in permissive jurisdictions.
6.  **Date Rape Drug:** Due to sedative effects and disinhibition.

### Chronic Poisoning (Addiction)
*   High addiction potential. Tolerance develops rapidly.
*   **Symptoms:** Ataxia, slurred speech, mental confusion, memory loss, depression.
*   **Withdrawal:** Abrupt cessation can be life-threatening (anxiety, tremors, **convulsions**, delirium).
