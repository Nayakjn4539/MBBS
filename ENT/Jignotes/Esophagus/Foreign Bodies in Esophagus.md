# [[Esophagus]] > Foreign Bodies in Esophagus

### Foreign Bodies in Esophagus

**Introduction and Epidemiology**
Ingestion of foreign bodies is a common otolaryngological emergency. While many objects pass spontaneously through the gastrointestinal tract, impaction in the [[esophagus]] requires urgent medical intervention.
*   **Children:** Most common group (peaks at 1–4 years). usually accidental ingestion of coins (most common), toys, or batteries.
*   **Adults:** Usually accidental during eating (bones) or due to carelessness (holding nails/pins in mouth).
*   **Elderly:** Associated with [[dentures]] (lack of tactile sensation), strictures, or malignancy.
*   **Psychiatric Patients/Prisoners:** Deliberate ingestion.

### Etiology and Predisposing Factors
| **Factor** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Age** | Children (curiosity), Elderly (poor dentition, dentures). |
| **Dietary Habits** | Rapid eating, talking while eating, inadequate mastication. |
| **Anatomical/Pathological** | [[Esophageal stricture]], [[malignancy]], [[web]], or [[pouch]] can arrest a food bolus. |
| **Altered Sensorium** | Alcohol intoxication, deep sleep, coma, general anesthesia. |
| **Decreased Sensation** | Upper dentures cover the palate, reducing tactile sensation, leading to accidental swallowing of bones. |

### Types of Foreign Bodies
*   **Non-irritating:** Coins (most common in children), plastic toys, glass, metallic objects.
*   **Irritating/Sharp:** Fish bones (often tonsil/vallecula but can be esophageal), chicken bones, dentures (wire hooks), safety pins.
*   **Vegetable/Organic:** Meat bolus (common in adults with underlying pathology), beans (may swell).
*   **Corrosive:** [[Disc battery]] (Button battery) - **Medical Emergency**.

### Sites of Impaction
Foreign bodies typically lodge at sites of physiological narrowing (constrictions) of the esophagus.

1.  **Cricopharyngeal Sphincter (C6):**
    *   **Most common site** of impaction.
    *   Located ~15 cm from upper incisor teeth.
    *   The [[cricopharyngeus muscle]] has strong tone; once an object passes this, it usually traverses the rest of the esophagus unless there is a pathological stricture.
2.  **Broncho-Aortic Constriction (T4):**
    *   Where the [[arch of aorta]] and [[left main bronchus]] cross the esophagus.
    *   Located ~25 cm from incisors.
3.  **Diaphragmatic Hiatus (T10):**
    *   Where esophagus pierces the diaphragm ([[Lower Esophageal Sphincter]]).
    *   Located ~40 cm from incisors.

> **Clinical Insight:** A foreign body lodged lower down in the esophagus (distal to cricopharynx) in an adult should raise suspicion of an underlying pathology like a [[stricture]] or [[carcinoma of esophagus]].

### Clinical Features
**Symptoms**
*   **History:** usually a clear history of ingestion (choking/gagging episode) is available.
*   **Dysphagia:** Inability or difficulty in swallowing.
*   **Odynophagia:** Pain on swallowing (indicates spasm or mucosal injury).
*   **Drooling:** Absolute dysphagia leads to pooling of saliva.
*   **Sensation:** A sensation of "something sticking" in the throat or retrosternal area.
*   **Pain:** Localized to the suprasternal notch or radiating to the back (interscapular) suggests impaction.
*   **Respiratory Distress:** Large objects in the upper esophagus (especially in children) can compress the soft posterior wall of the [[trachea]], causing stridor or dyspnea.

**Signs**
*   **Tenderness:** Lower neck tenderness (on the left or right of trachea).
*   **Pooling of Saliva:** Seen in the [[pyriform fossa]] on indirect laryngoscopy (Chevalier Jackson's sign).
*   **Visible FB:** Occasionally seen protruding from the post-cricoid region.

### Diagnostic Evaluation

**1. Radiology (X-rays)**
*   **Views:** Soft tissue neck (Lateral) and Chest (PA).
*   **Findings:**
    *   **Radio-opaque objects:** Coins, metal toys, batteries are easily visualized.
    *   **Radiolucent objects:** Indirect signs include widening of the [[prevertebral space]], loss of cervical lordosis (straightening of spine), or air bubbles in the cervical esophagus.
    *   **Coin Orientation:**
        *   **Esophagus:** Appears circular (face-on) in PA view and linear (edge-on) in Lateral view. (Because the esophagus is flattened anteroposteriorly).
        *   **Trachea:** Appears linear (edge-on) in PA view and circular in Lateral view. (Because cartilaginous rings keep trachea open).

> **Mnemonic for Coin Orientation:**
> **PACE** = **P**A view, **A**irway (Trachea) shows **C**oin as **E**dge (Linear).
> Alternatively: **"Coins in the esophagus are seen 'Full Moon' on PA view."**

**2. Contrast Studies (Barium Swallow)**
*   **Indication:** Suspected radiolucent foreign body (e.g., fish bone, plastic).
*   **Contraindication:** Suspected perforation or if endoscopy is imminent (barium coats mucosa, making visualization difficult).
*   **Technique:** Cotton wool soaked in barium (barium swallow wisp) may catch on a sharp object.

**3. Computed Tomography (CT)**
*   High sensitivity for identifying fish bones and assessing complications like [[mediastinitis]] or [[abscess]].

**4. Endoscopy**
*   Both diagnostic and therapeutic.

### Management

**A. Medical Management (Limited Role)**
*   **Observation:** Only for blunt objects that have passed into the stomach (most pass spontaneously per rectum).
*   **Medication:** Glucagon (to relax LES) or gas-forming agents are described but generally **not recommended** due to low success rates and risk of complications.

**B. Endoscopic Removal (Treatment of Choice)**
*   **Rigid Esophagoscopy:**
    *   **Standard of care**, especially for sharp, impacted, or pediatric foreign bodies.
    *   Performed under General Anesthesia.
    *   Allows protection of the airway and use of strong grasping forceps.
*   **Flexible Esophagoscopy:**
    *   Can be used for soft food boluses or blunt objects in adults.
    *   Less traumatic but airway control is not as secure as rigid endoscopy.

**Techniques for Specific Objects:**
*   **Coins:** Grasp with alligator forceps; rotate to align with the coronal plane (largest diameter of glottis) during extraction.
*   **Meat Bolus:** Push into stomach (if no stricture) or extract piecemeal.
*   **Sharp Objects (Open safety pin/Denture):** The sharp point must be sheathed into the esophagoscope lumen before extraction to prevent mucosal laceration (point-trailing technique).
*   **Disc Batteries:** **Emergency removal** required to prevent liquefactive necrosis and perforation (can occur within 4 hours).

**C. Surgical Approaches (Rarely needed)**
Indicated if endoscopic removal fails, perforation occurs, or for complicated impacted objects.
1.  **Cervical Esophagotomy:** For objects impacted in the cervical esophagus.
2.  **Transthoracic Esophagotomy:** For objects in the thoracic esophagus.

### Complications
If left untreated or removed unskillfully, foreign bodies can cause severe morbidity:

| **Complication** | **Mechanism** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Perforation** | Sharp objects or pressure necrosis. Leads to [[surgical emphysema]], [[mediastinitis]], [[pneumothorax]]. |
| **Para-esophageal Abscess** | Infection spreading to retropharyngeal or parapharyngeal spaces. |
| **Tracheo-esophageal Fistula** | Pressure necrosis between anterior esophageal wall and posterior tracheal wall. |
| **Vascular Erosion** | **Aorto-esophageal fistula** (fatal hemorrhage), typically sentinel bleed followed by exsanguination. |
| **Respiratory Obstruction** | Tracheal compression by large esophageal FB or laryngeal edema. |
| **Stricture Formation** | Late complication due to mucosal injury and fibrosis. |

### Special Scenario: Disc Battery Ingestion
*   **Mechanism of Injury:** Electrolyte leakage, pressure necrosis, and generation of local electrical current causing **liquefactive necrosis**.
*   **Radiological Sign:** **"Double Ring Sign"** or **"Halo Sign"** on X-ray (distinguishes battery from a coin).
*   **Step-off sign:** On lateral view, the battery has a step-off (negative terminal is narrower), unlike a flat coin.
*   **Management:** Immediate endoscopic removal. Do not wait.
