# [[Clinical Examination]] > Examination of Knee

### Clinical Assessment of the Knee

The clinical examination of the [[Knee Joint]] follows the standard orthopedic sequence: Look, Feel, Move, and Special Tests. It focuses on identifying pathology in the bones, ligaments, menisci, and extensor mechanism.

#### 1. History Taking
Key symptoms guide the physical examination:
*   **Pain:** Determine if generalized (inflammatory/degenerative) or localized (mechanical).
    *   *Anterior pain:* [[Patellofemoral joint]] pathology or [[Patellar tendinopathy]] ("Jumper's knee").
    *   *Medial/Lateral pain:* Meniscal or collateral ligament injury.
*   **Swelling:**
    *   *Immediate (0-2 hours):* Suggests [[Haemarthrosis]] (blood). Causes: [[Anterior Cruciate Ligament]] (ACL) tear, osteochondral fracture, or peripheral meniscal tear.
    *   *Delayed (6-24 hours):* Suggests synovial effusion (serous fluid). Causes: Meniscal tears or reactive synovitis.
*   **Locking:**
    *   **True Locking:** The knee gets stuck in flexion and cannot fully extend due to a mechanical block (e.g., Bucket-handle tear of [[Meniscus]], Loose body). Unlocking may be sudden.
    *   **Pseudo-locking:** Restriction due to pain or muscle spasm, often seen in acute injury or [[Chondromalacia patellae]].
*   **Giving Way:** Suggests instability (ACL deficiency) or reflex inhibition of the quadriceps due to pain (patellofemoral issues).

#### 2. Inspection (Look)
Examination begins with the patient standing (for alignment) and walking (gait), followed by supine examination.

*   **Gait:**
    *   **Antalgic Gait:** Short stance phase on the painful leg.
    *   **Hand-Knee Gait:** Patient pushes the thigh back with a hand to lock the knee in extension (indicates [[Quadriceps]] weakness).
*   **Deformity (Alignment):**
    *   **Genu Valgum:** "Knock-knees" (distal part lateral).
    *   **Genu Varum:** "Bow-legs" (distal part medial).
    *   **Genu Recurvatum:** Hyperextension of the knee.
*   **Swelling:**
    *   **Generalized:** Horse-shoe shaped swelling above and around the patella suggests effusion.
    *   **Localized:** Prepatellar bursitis (Housemaid's knee) or Infrapatellar bursitis (Clergyman's knee).
*   **Muscle Wasting:** Inspect the thigh girth. The **Vastus Medialis** is the first to waste in knee pathology.
*   **Position of Patella:** Check for *Patella Alta* (high) or *Patella Baja* (low).

#### 3. Palpation (Feel)
Always compare with the normal side.

*   **Temperature:** Assess for warmth using the back of the hand (inflammation/infection).
*   **Tenderness:** Palpate specific landmarks:
    *   **Joint Line:** Tenderness here is the most sensitive sign for [[Meniscal Tear]].
    *   **Collateral Ligaments:** Tenderness at femoral or tibial attachments suggests sprain.
    *   **Tibial Tuberosity:** Tenderness suggests [[Osgood-Schlatter Disease]].
*   **Synovial Thickening:** Feels "doughy" or boggy. The fingers slip off the patella edges rather than grasping it firmly.

**Tests for Effusion (Fluid in the Joint):**
| Test | Indication | Technique |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Patellar Tap** | Large Effusion | Compress suprapatellar pouch with one hand; tap patella against femur with index finger of other hand. A "click" indicates fluid lifting the patella. |
| **Bulge/Wipe Test** | Minimal Effusion | Stroke medial side upwards to empty fluid; stroke lateral side downwards. Watch for a fluid wave/bulge reappearing on the medial side. |
| **Fluctuation Test** | Moderate Effusion | Place hands above and below patella; alternate compression. |

#### 4. Movement (Move)
*   **Range of Motion (ROM):** Normal range is roughly 0° (extension) to 140° (flexion).
*   **Extensor Lag:** Inability to perform the last 10-15° of extension actively, despite full passive extension (indicates Quadriceps weakness or disruption).
*   **Crepitus:** Palpable crunching sensation on movement (Suggests [[Osteoarthritis]] or Chondromalacia).

#### 5. Special Tests
These provoke specific structures to identify pathology.

##### A. Tests for Meniscal Injuries
The meniscus is fibrocartilage; tears often cause mechanical symptoms.

**1. McMurray’s Test**
*   **Technique:** With patient supine, flex the knee completely. Palpate the joint line.
    *   **For Medial Meniscus:** Externally rotate the foot/tibia and extend the knee with Valgus stress.
    *   **For Lateral Meniscus:** Internally rotate the foot/tibia and extend the knee with Varus stress.
*   **Positive Sign:** A palpable or audible "click" or "thud" accompanied by pain.
*   **Clinical Implication:** Identifies posterior horn tears.

> **Mnemonic:** **LAMP**
> **L**ateral Meniscus - **A**dduction (Varus) + **M**edial (Internal) Rotation
> **P** = (Testing from flexion to extension)

**2. Apley’s Grinding (Compression) Test**
*   **Technique:** Patient prone, knee flexed to 90°. Examiner applies axial compression (downward pressure) on the foot while rotating the tibia.
*   **Positive Sign:** Pain indicates meniscal injury.
*   **Distraction Test:** If pain occurs when *pulling* the leg up (distraction), the pathology is ligamentous, not meniscal.

**3. Thessaly Test**
*   **Technique:** Patient stands on the affected leg (knee flexed 20°). Patient twists body left and right.
*   **Positive Sign:** Joint line pain or locking.

##### B. Tests for Cruciate Ligaments (Stability)
[[Anterior Cruciate Ligament]] (ACL) and [[Posterior Cruciate Ligament]] (PCL) prevent anteroposterior translation.

**1. Lachman Test (Gold Standard for ACL)**
*   **Technique:** Knee flexed 20-30°. Stabilize femur with one hand, pull tibia anteriorly with the other.
*   **Positive Sign:** Excessive anterior translation with a "soft end point".
*   **Clinical Implication:** Most sensitive test for ACL rupture.

**2. Anterior Drawer Test**
*   **Technique:** Knee flexed 90°, hip flexed 45°. Examiner sits on patient's foot and pulls tibia forward.
*   **Positive Sign:** Anterior displacement >5mm compared to normal side.
*   **Note:** Less sensitive than Lachman in acute injury due to hamstring spasm.

**3. Pivot Shift Test**
*   **Technique:** Start with knee extended. Apply valgus stress and internal rotation while flexing the knee.
*   **Positive Sign:** A palpable "clunk" or subluxation at 20-40° flexion as the tibia reduces.
*   **Clinical Implication:** Indicates rotational instability (ACL tear).

**4. Posterior Drawer Test**
*   **Technique:** Same position as anterior drawer (90° flexion). Push tibia posteriorly.
*   **Positive Sign:** Posterior translation of tibia.
*   **Clinical Implication:** PCL injury.

**5. Posterior Sag Sign (Godfrey Test)**
*   **Technique:** Patient supine, hips and knees flexed to 90°. Look at the knee from the side.
*   **Positive Sign:** The tibia "sags" or drops backward due to gravity.

##### C. Tests for Collateral Ligaments
[[Medial Collateral Ligament]] (MCL) and [[Lateral Collateral Ligament]] (LCL).

**1. Valgus Stress Test (MCL)**
*   **Technique:** Knee flexed 30°. Apply force pushing the knee inward (valgus) while stabilizing the ankle.
*   **Positive Sign:** Opening up of the medial joint line or pain.

**2. Varus Stress Test (LCL)**
*   **Technique:** Knee flexed 30°. Apply force pushing the knee outward (varus).
*   **Positive Sign:** Opening of the lateral joint line.

*Note: Testing at 0° (full extension) assesses the capsule and cruciate ligaments in addition to collaterals. Laxity at 0° indicates major disruption.*

##### D. Tests for Patellofemoral Joint

**1. Patellar Apprehension Test (Fairbank’s)**
*   **Technique:** Push the patella laterally while the knee is slightly flexed.
*   **Positive Sign:** Patient contracts quadriceps and looks apprehensive/anxious (fearing dislocation).
*   **Clinical Implication:** Recurrent [[Patellar Dislocation]].

**2. Patellar Grinding Test (Clarke’s Sign)**
*   **Technique:** Press patella against the femur and ask patient to contract quadriceps.
*   **Positive Sign:** Retropatellar pain.
*   **Clinical Implication:** [[Chondromalacia Patellae]] or Patellofemoral arthritis.
