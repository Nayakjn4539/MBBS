# [[Identification]] > x- Ray based Age Estimation from bones of upper limb Ossification

### X-Ray Based Age Estimation from Bones of Upper Limb

Radiological examination of the upper limb is a crucial method for [[age estimation]] in living individuals (for judicial purposes) and in skeletal remains. It involves studying the appearance of [[ossification centers]] and their fusion with the diaphysis (shaft).

The estimation is typically accurate within a range of **± 1 to 2 years**. Females generally achieve ossification milestones **1–2 years earlier** than males.

### 1. The Shoulder Joint
The shoulder girdle involves the clavicle, scapula, and the upper end of the humerus.

#### A. Clavicle (Collar Bone)
This is a medicolegally significant bone as it is the **first bone to ossify** (5th week IUL) but its medial end is the **last epiphysis to fuse** in the body.

*   **Medial End Epiphysis:**
    *   **Appearance:** 18–19 years.
    *   **Fusion:** 21–22 years.
    *   **Significance:** Complete fusion of the medial end of the clavicle is a reliable indicator that the individual is **above 21 years** of age (useful for establishing majority).

#### B. Scapula (Shoulder Blade)
*   **Coracoid Process:** Fuses with the scapula around **15 years**.
*   **Acromion Process:**
    *   Appearance: 14–15 years.
    *   Fusion: **18–19 years**.

#### C. Humerus (Upper End)
*   **Appearance:**
    *   Head: 1 year.
    *   Greater Tuberosity: 3 years.
    *   Lesser Tuberosity: 5 years.
*   **Conjoint Epiphysis:** The centers for the head, greater tuberosity, and lesser tuberosity fuse together to form a "conjoint epiphysis" at **6 years**.
*   **Fusion with Shaft:** The conjoint epiphysis fuses with the shaft at **18–20 years**.

### 2. The Elbow Joint
The elbow is critical for estimating age in the **adolescent age group (13–17 years)**. It involves the lower end of the humerus and the upper ends of the radius and ulna.

**Mnemonic for Appearance: CRITOE**
(Note: Ages are approximate ranges found in Indian subjects)

| Order | Structure | Appearance | Fusion with Shaft |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **C** | **C**apitulum (Lateral Condyle) | 1 year | 16–17 years |
| **R** | **R**adial Head | 3–5 years | 16–17 years |
| **I** | **I**nternal (Medial) Epicondyle | 5–7 years | **16–17 years** |
| **T** | **T**rochlea | 9–10 years | 16–17 years |
| **O** | **O**lecranon (Ulna) | 9–10 years | 16–17 years |
| **E** | **E**xternal (Lateral) Epicondyle | 11–12 years | Fuses with capitulum/trochlea ~14 yrs, then to shaft at 16–17 yrs |

**Key Points:**
*   At **14 years**: The Lateral epicondyle fuses with the Capitulum and Trochlea.
*   By **16–17 years**: All epiphyses around the elbow joint typically complete fusion with their respective shafts.

### 3. The Wrist Joint and Hand
The wrist is the most preferred region for age estimation in children and young adults due to the sequential appearance of multiple carpal bones and the fusion of the distal radius/ulna.

#### A. Carpal Bones (Appearance)
These are useful for determining age in early childhood.
**Mnemonic:** **S**he **L**ooks **T**oo **P**retty **T**ry **T**o **C**atch **H**er (Scaphoid, Lunate, Triquetral, Pisiform, Trapezium, Trapezoid, Capitate, Hamate).

*Note: The order of appearance is actually Capitate first.*

| Bone | Appearance Age |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Capitate** | 2 months |
| **Hamate** | 3 months |
| **Triquetral** | 3 years |
| **Lunate** | 4 years |
| **Scaphoid** | 5 years |
| **Trapezium** | 5–6 years |
| **Trapezoid** | 5–6 years |
| **Pisiform** | **9–12 years** |

*   **Rule of Thumb for Carpals:** Number of carpal bones visible on X-ray roughly equals **Age in years** (up to 7 years).
*   **Pisiform:** It is a sesamoid bone and the last carpal to appear (9–12 years).

#### B. Lower Ends of Radius and Ulna
*   **Lower end of Radius:** Appears at 1–2 years.
*   **Lower end of Ulna:** Appears at 5–6 years.
*   **Fusion:** Both fuse with their respective shafts at **18–19 years**.

#### C. Metacarpals and Phalanges
*   **Appearance:** 2–3 years.
*   **Fusion:** Base of 1st metacarpal and heads of 2nd–5th metacarpals fuse at **16–18 years**.

| Age (Approx.) | Ossification Event |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1 Year** | Head of Humerus, Capitulum, Lower end Radius appear. |
| **3–5 Years** | Triquetral, Lunate, Scaphoid, Trapezium appear. |
| **6 Years** | Conjoint epiphysis of Upper Humerus forms. |
| **9–12 Years** | **Pisiform** appears (Wrist). |
| **14 Years** | Fusion of lateral epicondyle with capitulum/trochlea. |
| **16–17 Years** | Fusion of **Elbow Joint** (Lower Humerus, Upper Radius/Ulna). |
| **18–19 Years** | Fusion of **Wrist Joint** (Lower Radius/Ulna). |
| **18–20 Years** | Fusion of **Shoulder Joint** (Head of Humerus). |
| **> 21 Years** | Fusion of **Medial End of Clavicle**. |

### Medicolegal Aspects of Age Estimation

1.  **Consent:** Informed written consent is mandatory before taking X-rays for age estimation. In accused persons, reasonable force can be used (Sec 53 CrPC).
2.  **Criminal Responsibility:**
    *   **< 7 years:** No criminal responsibility (*Doli Incapax* - Sec 82 IPC).
    *   **7–12 years:** Qualified responsibility (*Doli Capax* - Sec 83 IPC) based on maturity.
3.  **Juvenile Justice:** Determining if an accused is a juvenile (<18 years) to be tried under the Juvenile Justice Act.
4.  **Consent for Sex:** Determining if the victim is above 18 years (Age of consent for sexual intercourse).
5.  **Marriage:** Legal age is 18 for females and 21 for males.
6.  **Identification:** To establish the identity of unknown skeletal remains or decomposing bodies.
