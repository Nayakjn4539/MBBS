# [[Communicable Diseases - Surface Infections]] > Trachoma

# **Trachoma (Rough Eye)**

### **Problem Statement**
Trachoma is a chronic infectious disease of the conjunctiva and cornea. It is the leading cause of [[preventable blindness]] worldwide. It is classified as a "Water-washed" disease (lack of water for hygiene). India was declared free from ‘infective Trachoma’ in December 2017.

### **Epidemiological Determinants**

**1. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** [[Chlamydia trachomatis]]. It is an obligatory intracellular bacteria (formerly thought to be a virus).
*   **Serotypes:**
    *   **A, B, Ba, C:** Cause hyperendemic blinding Trachoma.
    *   **D to K:** Cause Inclusion Conjunctivitis (paratrachoma) and genital infections.
    *   **L1, L2, L3:** Cause Lymphogranuloma Venereum (LGV).
*   **Resistance:** The organism is susceptible to sulphonamides and antibiotics like tetracycline and macrolides.

**2. Host Factors**
*   **Reservoir:** Children (especially 2–5 years old) with active disease are the main reservoir.
*   **Age:** Infection starts in infancy. Active infection is most common in young children; blinding sequelae (trichiasis/entropion) appear in adults (4th decade).
*   **Sex:** Females are affected more than males (likely due to closer contact with infected children).
*   **Immunity:** Infection does not confer lifelong immunity; re-infection is common.

**3. Environmental Factors**
*   **Risk Factors:**
    *   **P** - Poverty and overcrowding.
    *   **D** - Dust, smoke, and irritants (e.g., Kajal/Surma).
    *   **F** - Flies (specifically *Musca sorbens* or eye-seeking flies).
    *   **W** - Water scarcity (poor personal hygiene).

### **Transmission**
*   **Routes:**
    *   **Direct Contact:** Eye-to-eye transmission via fingers.
    *   **Indirect Contact:** Fomites (towels, pillows, bedsheets, kajal sticks).
    *   **Vector:** Mechanical transmission by flies.
*   **Incubation Period:** 5 to 12 days.
*   **Communicability:** Highly infectious during the active phase (presence of follicles/inflammation); not infectious after complete cicatrization (scarring).

---

### **Clinical Features**
The disease progresses from active inflammation to scarring.
*   **Symptoms:** Redness, foreign body sensation, lacrimation, photophobia, and mucopurulent discharge.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Conjunctival Follicles:** Look like "sago grains" (mostly on upper tarsal conjunctiva).
    *   **Papillae:** Velvety appearance of conjunctiva.
    *   **Pannus:** Infiltration of cornea by vascular tissue (mostly upper margin).
    *   **[[Herbert's Pits]]:** Pigmented depressions at the limbus (pathognomonic of past infection).
    *   **Sequelae:** Trichiasis (inward turning of eyelashes) and Entropion (inward rolling of lid margin) leading to corneal opacity.

### **WHO Grading of Trachoma (FIST-O)**
To simplify diagnosis in the field, WHO introduced the following grading system:

| Code | Definition | Diagnostic Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TF** | **T**rachomatous Inflammation - **F**ollicular | Presence of **5 or more follicles** (>0.5mm) on upper tarsal conjunctiva. |
| **TI** | **T**rachomatous Inflammation - **I**ntense | Pronounced inflammatory thickening obscuring >50% of normal deep tarsal vessels. |
| **TS** | **T**rachomatous **S**carring | Presence of scarring (white bands/sheets) in tarsal conjunctiva. |
| **TT** | **T**rachomatous **T**richiasis | At least one eyelash rubs on the eyeball (Potential for blindness). |
| **CO** | **C**orneal **O**pacity | Easily visible corneal opacity over the pupil. |

### **Diagnosis**
1.  **Clinical:** In field surveys, at least **2** of the following must be present:
    *   Follicles on upper tarsal conjunctiva.
    *   Limbal follicles or Herbert’s pits.
    *   Typical conjunctival scarring.
    *   Vascular pannus.
2.  **Laboratory:**
    *   **Giemsa Stain:** Demonstration of intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (Halberstaedter-Prowazek bodies) in conjunctival scrapings.
    *   **PCR:** Polymerase Chain Reaction is the gold standard (high sensitivity).

---

### **Treatment**
**1. Antibiotics:**
*   **Drug of Choice:** [[Azithromycin]] (Oral).
    *   **Dose:** 20 mg/kg body weight (active cases) or 1 gram stat for adults.
*   **Alternative:** 1% Tetracycline eye ointment (active against Chlamydia).
    *   **Regimen:** Applied BD for 6 weeks.

**2. Mass Drug Administration (MDA) Guidelines (WHO)**:
*   **Prevalence > 10%:** Mass treatment of the **entire community** with Azithromycin.
*   **Prevalence 5–10%:** Targeted treatment (treat the case + family/household).
*   **Prevalence < 5%:** Treat individual cases; mass distribution not necessary.

### **Prevention and Control: SAFE Strategy**
The WHO adopted the **SAFE** strategy for the global elimination of blinding trachoma by the year 2020 (**GET 2020**).

| Acronym | Component | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **S** | **S**urgery | For **Trichiasis** and **Entropion** (bilamellar tarsal rotation) to prevent corneal damage. |
| **A** | **A**ntibiotics | **Azithromycin** (single dose) or Tetracycline ointment to treat active infection and reduce the reservoir. |
| **F** | **F**acial Cleanliness | Frequent face washing to remove ocular discharge, preventing fly attraction and auto-infection. |
| **E** | **E**nvironmental Improvement | Improved water supply, sanitation, and vector (fly) control. |

> **Clinical Relevance:** **Blinding Trachoma** is defined as the presence of trichiasis, entropion, or corneal opacity. It typically occurs in communities with a blindness rate >0.5%.
