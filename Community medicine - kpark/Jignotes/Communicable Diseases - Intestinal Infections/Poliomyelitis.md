# [[Communicable Diseases - Intestinal Infections]] > Poliomyelitis

# [[Poliomyelitis]]

Acute viral infection caused by the poliovirus, primarily affecting the alimentary tract but capable of affecting the central nervous system, leading to paralysis and death.

### 1. Epidemiological Determinants

**A. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** [[Poliovirus]] (RNA virus, genus Enterovirus, family Picornaviridae).
*   **Serotypes:** Three serotypes exist: Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3.
    *   **Type 1:** Most common cause of epidemics and paralysis.
    *   **Type 3:** Most frequently associated with Vaccine Associated Paralytic Polio ([[VAPP]]).
    *   **Type 2:** Eradicated globally; most antigenic.
*   **Resistance:** Survives in water for 4 months and feces for 6 months in cold environments; killed by heat, pasteurization, and chlorination.

**B. Reservoir of Infection**
*   **Man is the only reservoir**.
*   There are **NO chronic carriers**.
*   Infection is maintained by subclinical cases (mild infections).

**C. Host Factors**
*   **Age:** Primarily affects children under 5 years.
*   **Sex:** M:F ratio is 3:1.
*   **Risk Factors (Provocative Polio):** Intramuscular injections, trauma, or tonsillectomy during the incubation period can precipitate paralysis in an already infected individual.

**D. Environmental Factors**
*   More common in the **rainy season**.
*   Favored by poor sanitation, overcrowding, and fly density.

### 2. Transmission and Communicability

*   **Mode of Transmission:**
    *   **Fecal-Oral Route:** Main route in developing countries.
    *   **Droplet Infection:** Possible in acute phases, relevant in developed countries.
*   **Incubation Period:** Usually **7 to 14 days** (Range: 3–35 days).
*   **Period of Communicability:**
    *   **Most infectious:** 7–10 days before and after the onset of symptoms.
    *   Virus excreted in feces for 2–3 weeks (up to 3–4 months).

### 3. Clinical Picture: The Iceberg Phenomenon

Polio manifests as a classic [[Iceberg Phenomenon]].

| Clinical Presentation | Percentage | Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inapparent Infection** | 90–95% | Asymptomatic; virus replicates in gut; develops immunity. |
| **Abortive Polio** | 4–8% | Minor illness: Fever, sore throat, vomiting. Recover quickly. |
| **Non-Paralytic Polio** | ~1% | Aseptic meningitis: Stiffness of neck/back, positive Kernig's sign. |
| **Paralytic Polio** | < 1% | Asymmetrical flaccid paralysis. |

**Features of Paralytic Polio:**
*   **Descending paralysis:** Starts at hip/shoulder and moves distal.
*   **Asymmetrical:** One side affected more than the other.
*   **Flaccid:** Lower Motor Neuron (LMN) type; deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) diminished/absent.
*   **Sensory Loss:** **ABSENT** (Pain and touch sensations are normal).
*   **Tripod Sign:** Child sits by supporting hands behind the back.

### 4. Diagnosis and Surveillance

**Acute Flaccid Paralysis ([[AFP]]) Surveillance**
*   **Case Definition:** Any child **< 15 years** with sudden onset of flaccid paralysis OR any person of any age if polio is suspected.
*   **Specimen Collection:**
    *   **Two stool samples** required.
    *   Collected **24–48 hours apart**.
    *   Within **14 days** of onset of paralysis.
    *   Transported via **Reverse Cold Chain** (maintained at +2°C to +8°C).
*   **Confirmation:** Isolation of wild poliovirus from stool (Gold Standard).

### 5. Treatment

*   **No specific antiviral treatment** exists.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Acute Phase:** Rest, nursing care, prevent contractures. *Neutral position* for limbs.
    *   **Convalescent Phase:** Physiotherapy and rehabilitation.

### 6. Prevention: Immunization

Two main types of vaccines are used.

| Feature | **OPV (Sabin)** | **IPV (Salk)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type** | Live Attenuated | Killed/Inactivated |
| **Route** | Oral (2 drops) | IM (0.5ml) or ID (0.1ml) |
| **Immunity** | **Systemic (Humoral) + Local (Intestinal IgA)** | Humoral (IgG) only |
| **Herd Immunity** | **Yes** (Excreted virus immunizes contacts) | No |
| **Use in Epidemic** | **Useful** (Rapid immunity) | Not useful |
| **Risk** | **VAPP** (Vaccine Associated Paralytic Polio) | No VAPP |
| **Stability** | Heat Sensitive (Needs -20°C for long term) | More stable |

**National Immunization Schedule (India):**
*   **OPV:** Birth dose (Zero dose), 6, 10, 14 weeks + Booster at 16-24 months.
*   **fIPV (Fractional IPV):** 0.1 ml Intradermal at 6 weeks and 14 weeks.
*   **Note:** Switch from **tOPV** (trivalent) to **bOPV** (bivalent - types 1 & 3) occurred globally in April 2016 to prevent type 2 VDPV.

**Clinical Relevance:**
*   **VAPP:** Paralysis occurring in a vaccine recipient or contact. Associated with reversion of vaccine virus neurovirulence (mostly Type 3).
*   **VDPV (Vaccine Derived Polio Virus):** Strains of polio virus that have mutated from the vaccine strain and circulate in under-immunized communities.

### 7. Polio Eradication Strategies

The 4-pronged strategy used in India (and globally) to eliminate polio:

1.  **Routine Immunization (RI):** High coverage (>80%) with OPV/IPV in infants.
2.  **[[Pulse Polio Immunization]] (PPI):**
    *   **Definition:** Simultaneous mass administration of OPV on a single day to **ALL** children **0–5 years**, regardless of previous immunization status.
    *   **Aim:** To flood the environment with vaccine virus and replace the wild virus.
    *   **Frequency:** National Immunization Days (NIDs) and Sub-National Immunization Days (SNIDs).
3.  **Surveillance of AFP:** To detect viral circulation.
    *   **Indicator:** Non-polio AFP rate should be >2 per 100,000 population <15 years.
4.  **Mopping-Up Operations:** Door-to-door immunization in high-risk districts where the virus is known/suspected to be circulating.

**The Endgame Strategic Plan:**
*   **The Switch:** Removal of Type 2 component from OPV (tOPV $\rightarrow$ bOPV) to stop cVDPV type 2.
*   **IPV Introduction:** To maintain immunity against Type 2 after the switch.
*   **Containment:** Destruction of wild poliovirus stocks in labs.

**Current Status:**
*   **India:** Declared **Polio Free** on 27th March 2014. Last case: Jan 2011 (Howrah).
*   **Global:** Endemic only in **Afghanistan and Pakistan** (Type 1 WPV).

### Mnemonic

*   **P** - Pure motor (No sensory loss)
*   **C** - Child < 5 years (mostly)
*   **P** - Proximal > Distal, Patchy, Permanent (residual paralysis)
