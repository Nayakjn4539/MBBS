# Pleomorphic Adenoma (Benign Mixed Tumor)

**Pleomorphic Adenoma** is the most common benign neoplasm of the salivary glands. It is characterized by its cytomorphological diversity, containing both epithelial and mesenchymal elements, hence the term "Mixed Tumor".

### Epidemiology
*   **Incidence:**
    *   Accounts for **65–70%** of all salivary gland neoplasms.
    *   It is the most common tumor of the **[[Parotid gland]]** (80% of benign parotid tumors).
    *   It is also the most common benign tumor of the **minor [[Salivary glands]]**.
*   **Age:** Commonly seen in the **3rd to 5th decade** (30–60 years).
*   **Sex:** Slight female preponderance (F > M).

### Sites of Occurrence
1.  **Major Salivary Glands:**
    *   **Parotid Gland:** Most common site. usually arises from the **tail of the parotid** or the superficial lobe.
    *   **Deep Lobe Parotid:** Can arise here and present as a **[[Parapharyngeal tumor]]** pushing the tonsil medially.
    *   **Submandibular Gland:** Less common than parotid.
2.  **Oral Cavity (Minor Salivary Glands):**
    *   **Palate:** The most common intraoral site, typically at the junction of the **[[Hard palate]]** and **[[Soft palate]]**.
    *   Other sites: **[[Buccal mucosa]]**, lips, tongue, floor of mouth.

### Etiopathogenesis
*   **Theories:** Multicellular theory vs. Bicellular reserve cell theory.
*   **Cytogenetics:** Chromosomal abnormalities involving **3p21, 8q12, and 12q14-15** are seen. Ectopic expression of the **PLAG1 gene** is associated with 8q12 aberrations.

### Pathology
#### Gross Appearance
*   **Shape:** Solitary, smooth, round or oval, and lobulated.
*   **Capsule:** Well-encapsulated, but the capsule may be incomplete.
*   **Pseudopods:** The tumor sends finger-like projections (**pseudopods**) into the surrounding normal glandular tissue.
    *   *Clinical Implication:* Simple shelling out (enucleation) leads to recurrence because these microscopic pseudopods are left behind.
*   **Consistency:** Variable—solid, cartilaginous, or cystic (mucoid).

#### Histopathology
It is called a "Mixed Tumor" because it displays **pleomorphism** (variable appearance) with a mixture of:
1.  **Epithelial elements:** Duct-like structures, sheets, or strands.
2.  **Myoepithelial cells:** Spindle-shaped or plasmacytoid cells.
3.  **Mesenchymal stroma:** The background stroma varies and can be **mucoid (myxoid), fibroid, chondroid (cartilage-like), or osseous**.

### Clinical Features
**In the Parotid Gland:**
*   Painless, slow-growing swelling in the pre-auricular or infra-auricular region.
*   **Consistency:** Firm, rubbery, or cystic.
*   **Mobility:** Usually freely mobile.
*   **Facial Nerve:** Generally **spared** (not involved); facial palsy suggests malignancy.
*   **Deep Lobe Tumors:** May present as a dumbbell-shaped tumor extending through the stylomandibular tunnel into the **[[Parapharyngeal space]]**, causing a bulge in the lateral pharyngeal wall/soft palate.

**In the Oral Cavity (Palate):**
*   Presents as a **painless, submucosal, firm nodule** or mass.
*   Location: Lateral aspect of the posterior hard palate.
*   Overlying mucosa is usually intact/normal.
*   Usually slow-growing, but can attain a large size if neglected.

### Diagnosis and Investigations
1.  **Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology ([[FNAC]]):**
    *   First-line investigation.
    *   Distinguishes benign from malignant lesions with high accuracy.
2.  **Imaging (CT/MRI):**
    *   **[[MRI]]:** Preferred. On T2-weighted images, the tumor appears hyperintense (bright) due to myxoid tissue. It delineates deep lobe tumors and parapharyngeal extension.
    *   **CT Scan:** Shows a well-defined mass with sharp borders.
3.  **Biopsy:**
    *   **Parotid:** Open incisional biopsy is **contraindicated** due to risk of fistula formation and tumor seeding.
    *   **Intraoral (Palate):** Incisional biopsy is mandatory to rule out malignancy (as 50% of minor salivary gland tumors are malignant).

### Treatment
The main principle is **complete surgical excision** with a cuff of normal tissue.

| Site | Surgical Procedure | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Parotid (Superficial Lobe)** | **Superficial Parotidectomy** | Removes the tumor + superficial lobe while preserving the **[[Facial nerve]]**. |
| **Parotid (Deep Lobe)** | **Total Conservative Parotidectomy** | Removes deep lobe while preserving the facial nerve. |
| **Oral Cavity (Palate)** | **Wide Local Excision** | Includes removal of overlying mucosa and periosteum to prevent recurrence. |
| **Submandibular Gland** | **Total Gland Excision** | The entire gland is removed. |

**Important Note:** **Enucleation** (simply shelling out the tumor) is **CONTRAINDICATED** because of the risk of leaving behind pseudopods, leading to recurrence.

### Complications and Prognosis
1.  **Recurrence:**
    *   High recurrence rate if inadequate surgery (enucleation) is performed due to microscopic pseudopods.
    *   Recurrent tumors are often multifocal.
2.  **Malignant Transformation (Carcinoma ex Pleomorphic Adenoma):**
    *   Occurs in **2–10%** of cases.
    *   Risk increases with the duration of the tumor (long-standing cases).
    *   **Red Flags for Malignancy:**
        *   Sudden rapid increase in size of a long-standing stationary mass.
        *   Pain.
        *   Fixity to skin or underlying structures.
        *   **[[Facial nerve palsy]]**.
        *   Cervical lymphadenopathy.

### Summary Table: Benign vs. Malignant Features

| Feature | Benign (Pleomorphic Adenoma) | Malignant (e.g., Ca ex Pleomorphic Adenoma) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Growth Rate** | Slow, over years | Rapid increase |
| **Pain** | Painless | Painful |
| **Mobility** | Mobile | Fixed/Restricted |
| **Facial Nerve** | Normal function | Paresis or Paralysis |
| **Consistency** | Firm/Cystic/Lobular | Hard/Indurated |
