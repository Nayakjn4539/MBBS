# [[Medical Law And Ethics]] > Medical Council of India and State Councils

### Medical Council of India (MCI) / National Medical Commission (NMC)

The **Medical Council of India (MCI)** was a statutory body established under the **Indian Medical Council Act, 1956** (repealing the 1933 Act) to establish uniform standards of higher qualifications in medicine and recognition of medical qualifications in India and abroad,. 

*Note: The government superseded the MCI in 2010 and constituted a Board of Governors. Eventually, the National Medical Commission (NMC) replaced the MCI to overhaul medical education and regulation.*

#### Constitution
The Council was constituted by the Central Government and consisted of members including:
*   One member from each State nominated by the Central Government in consultation with the State Government.
*   One member from each University elected by the members of the medical faculty/Senate.
*   Members elected by registered medical practitioners enrolled in the State Medical Register.
*   Nominated members by the Central Government.

#### Functions of MCI/NMC
The primary responsibility is establishing and maintaining uniform standards of medical education.

**1. Maintenance of Indian Medical Register (IMR)**
*   It maintains a register of medical practitioners known as the [[Indian Medical Register]].
*   It contains names of all persons who are enrolled on any **State Medical Register**,.
*   If a name is removed from the State Medical Register, it is automatically removed from the IMR.

**2. Medical Education (Undergraduate and Postgraduate)**
*   Prescribes minimum standards of medical education required for granting recognized medical qualifications (MBBS, MD/MS, Super-specialty),.
*   **Inspections:** Appoints Medical Inspectors to visit medical colleges to verify adequacy of standards (staff, equipment, accommodation, training) during examinations,.
*   **Recognition/De-recognition:** Based on inspection reports, it recommends to the Central Government the recognition or withdrawal of recognition of medical qualifications of a college/university,.
*   **Permission:** Prior approval is mandatory to establish a new medical college, start a new course, or increase the number of seats,.

**3. Recognition of Medical Qualifications (The Schedules)**
The [[IMC Act 1956]] has specific schedules listing recognized degrees,,:

| Schedule | Content |
| :--- | :--- |
| **First Schedule** | Recognized medical qualifications granted by **Universities in India**. |
| **Second Schedule** | Recognized medical qualifications granted by institutions **outside India**. |
| **Third Schedule (Part I)** | Medical degrees granted by Indian Universities **not included** in the 1st Schedule. |
| **Third Schedule (Part II)** | Medical qualifications granted outside India **not included** in the 2nd Schedule. |

**4. Disciplinary Control and Ethics**
*   Prescribes standards of professional conduct, etiquette, and a [[Code of Medical Ethics]],.
*   **Warning Notice:** Issues a "Warning Notice" periodically, which is a list of offences that constitute **Serious Professional Misconduct** ([[Infamous Conduct]]),.
*   **Appellate Authority:** It acts as an appellate tribunal. If a doctor is aggrieved by the decision of a [[State Medical Council]] (e.g., removal of name), they can appeal to the Central Government/NMC,.

**5. Reciprocity**
*   Enters into negotiations with foreign authorities for the recognition of medical qualifications on a reciprocal basis,.

### State Medical Councils (SMC)

State Medical Councils are autonomous bodies established under the respective State Medical Council Acts.

#### Constitution
*   Members elected by registered medical practitioners from the State,.
*   Members elected by teachers of medical institutions/universities.
*   Members nominated by the State Government,.

#### Functions of State Medical Councils

**1. Medical Register**
*   Maintains the **State Medical Register**.
*   **Registration:** Any person with recognized qualifications can register. This involves **Provisional Registration** (for internship) followed by **Permanent Registration**,.
*   **Renewal:** In many states, registration must be renewed every 5 years, often linked to attending Credit Hours of Continuing Medical Education (CME) (approx. 30 hours every 5 years),.

**2. Disciplinary Control**
*   The SMC has the power of **disciplinary control** over medical practitioners,.
*   It takes cognizance of misconduct if a doctor is convicted by a court or if a complaint is lodged against them,.
*   It acts as a **judicial body** (quasi-judicial) and has the same powers as Civil Courts regarding summoning witnesses and discovery of documents.

**3. Punishment / Erasure of Name**
If a doctor is found guilty of [[Professional Misconduct]], the SMC can impose the following penalties,:
*   **Warning:** For minor offences.
*   **Temporary Erasure (Suspension):** Removal of name for a specific period.
*   **Penal Erasure (Professional Death Sentence):** Permanent removal of the name from the register for serious professional misconduct or conviction for a serious crime,. This deprives the practitioner of all privileges of a registered doctor.

**4. Warning Notice**
*   Like the NMC, the SMC also issues warning notices listing acts considered as infamous conduct (e.g., Adultery, Advertising, Addiction, Abortion—the **6 A's**),.
