# Acute Tonsillitis

**Definition**
Acute tonsillitis is an acute inflammation of the [[palatine tonsils]], which may involve the mucosa, crypts, follicles, or the tonsillar parenchyma. It often occurs as part of a generalized pharyngitis.

### Etiology
*   **Viral:** Infection usually initiates as a viral infection (Adenovirus, Influenza, Parainfluenza, Rhinovirus).,
*   **Bacterial:** Secondary bacterial invasion often follows. The most common causative organism is **Group A Beta-Hemolytic Streptococcus ([[GABHS]])**.,,
*   **Other organisms:** *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, *Pneumococcus*.,

### Pathological Types
Based on the progression and depth of infection, acute tonsillitis is classified into four types:,,,,

1.  **Acute Catarrhal Tonsillitis:** Part of generalized pharyngitis; mostly viral. Involves only the surface mucosa.
2.  **Acute Follicular Tonsillitis:** Infection spreads into the [[tonsillar crypts]]. These become filled with purulent material, presenting as **yellowish spots** at the opening of crypts.
3.  **Acute Parenchymatous Tonsillitis:** The whole tonsil substance is affected. Tonsils are uniformly enlarged, red, and swollen. Common in children.
4.  **Acute Membranous Tonsillitis:** Exudation from the crypts coalesces to form a membrane on the surface of the tonsil.

### Clinical Features
**Symptoms:**
*   **Sore throat:** The predominant symptom.
*   **Odynophagia:** Painful swallowing; the child may refuse to eat.,
*   **Fever:** High grade (101°F–104°F), often associated with chills and rigors.,
*   **Earache:** Referred pain via the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] (CN IX) which supplies both the tonsil and the ear.
*   **Constitutional symptoms:** Malaise, body ache, headache, constipation.
*   **Abdominal pain:** Due to mesenteric lymphadenitis (may mimic appendicitis in children).

**Signs:**
*   **Breath:** Fetid (halitosis) and coated tongue.
*   **Hyperemia:** Pillars, soft palate, and uvula are congested.
*   **Tonsils:** Red, swollen. Yellow beads of pus (follicular) or a membrane (membranous) may be seen. In parenchymatous type, tonsils may meet in the midline ("Kissing Tonsils").,
*   **Lymphadenopathy:** [[Jugulodigastric lymph nodes]] are enlarged and tender.,

### Differential Diagnosis of Membrane over Tonsil
If a membrane is visible, it must be differentiated from other conditions.,,

| Feature | Acute Follicular Tonsillitis | Diphtheria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Onset** | Acute | Insidious/Slow |
| **Fever** | High grade (>101°F) | Low grade (<100°F) |
| **Toxemia** | Mild | Severe (out of proportion to fever) |
| **Membrane** | Confined to tonsil; easily wiped off; does not bleed. | Extends to pillars/palate; dirty grey; adherent; **bleeds on removal**. |
| **Cervical Nodes** | Tender, enlarged | Massive (**Bull neck** appearance) |
| **Organism** | Streptococcus/Staphylococcus | *[[Corynebacterium diphtheriae]]* |
| **Treatment** | Antibiotics | **Antitoxin** + Antibiotics |,,,,

### Treatment
1.  **General:** Bed rest and plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration.
2.  **Analgesics:** Paracetamol or Ibuprofen to relieve pain and fever.
3.  **Antibiotics:**
    *   **Penicillin** is the drug of choice (Group A Strep is universally sensitive).
    *   Duration: 7–10 days to prevent complications like rheumatic fever.,
    *   Alternatives: Erythromycin (if penicillin-allergic), Amoxicillin-Clavulanate (if beta-lactamase resistance suspected).

# Chronic Tonsillitis

**Definition**
Chronic inflammation of the palatine tonsils, usually resulting from repeated attacks of acute tonsillitis or inadequately resolved acute infection.

### Etiology and Pathology
*   **Micro-abscesses:** Infection persists in the lymphoid follicles as micro-abscesses walled off by fibrous tissue.
*   **Risk Factors:** Chronic sinusitis, dental sepsis, subclinical infections.,
*   **Types:**,
    1.  **Chronic Follicular:** Crypts full of infected cheesy material (yellow spots).
    2.  **Chronic Parenchymatous:** Hyperplasia of lymphoid tissue leading to gross enlargement (may cause sleep apnea).
    3.  **Chronic Fibroid:** Tonsils are small, atrophic, and fibrosed but infected.

### Clinical Features
**Symptoms:**
*   Recurrent attacks of sore throat.
*   Chronic irritation, cough, or foreign body sensation.
*   **Halitosis:** Bad breath due to pus/debris in crypts.,
*   Thick speech or dysphagia (if tonsils are large).

**Signs (The Classic Triad):**
1.  **Flushing of Anterior Pillars:** Chronic hyperemia compared to the rest of the pharyngeal mucosa.,
2.  **Irwin Moore Sign (Positive Squeeze Test):** Pressure on the anterior pillar with a spatula expresses frank pus or cheesy material from the crypts.,,
3.  **Jugulodigastric Lymphadenopathy:** Nontender enlargement of lymph nodes at the angle of the mandible.,

**Grading of Tonsillar Enlargement (Brodsky/Friedman):**,
*   **Grade 0:** Tonsils absent (post-tonsillectomy).
*   **Grade 1:** Occupy <25% of oropharyngeal width (within pillars).
*   **Grade 2:** Occupy 25–50% (up to the brim of pillars).
*   **Grade 3:** Occupy 50–75% (extend beyond pillars).
*   **Grade 4:** Occupy >75% (**Kissing tonsils** touching midline).

# Complications of Tonsillitis

**Local:**
*   [[Peritonsillar Abscess]] (Quinsy)
*   Parapharyngeal abscess
*   Intratonsillar abscess
*   [[Tonsillolith]] (Tonsil stones),
*   Tonsillar cyst

**Systemic:** (Due to Group A Beta-Hemolytic Streptococcus)
*   Rheumatic Fever
*   Acute Glomerulonephritis
*   Subacute Bacterial Endocarditis
*   Cor Pulmonale (secondary to long-standing airway obstruction/sleep apnea in children).

# Tonsillectomy

**Definition:** Surgical removal of palatine tonsils.

### Indications
**Absolute Indications (Paradise Criteria):**,,
*   **Frequency of episodes:**
    *   $\ge$ 7 episodes in the preceding 1 year.
    *   $\ge$ 5 episodes/year for 2 consecutive years.
    *   $\ge$ 3 episodes/year for 3 consecutive years.
    *   *Note: Episodes must be clinically documented with fever, exudates, or positive culture.*
*   **Peritonsillar Abscess:** After 4-6 weeks in children (Interval tonsillectomy) or after the 2nd episode in adults.
*   **Airway Obstruction:** Causing Sleep Apnea (OSA) or Cor pulmonale.
*   **Suspected Malignancy:** Unilateral tonsillar enlargement.
*   **Febrile Seizures:** Caused by tonsillitis.

**Relative Indications:**
*   Diphtheria carriers (unresponsive to antibiotics).
*   Streptococcal carriers.
*   Chronic tonsillitis causing halitosis.
*   Access surgery for: [[Glossopharyngeal neuralgia]] or [[Eagle’s syndrome]] (elongated styloid process).

### Contraindications
**Mnemonic: ABCDEF**
*   **A**cute infection (wait for 3 weeks).
*   **B**leeding disorders (Hemophilia, Leukemia, Purpura).
*   **C**left palate (Overt or submucous - risk of rhinolalia aperta/velopharyngeal insufficiency).
*   **D**iphtheria epidemic.
*   **E**pidemic of [[Polio]] (Risk of bulbar polio).
*   **F**ailure to control systemic diseases (Diabetes, HTN).

### Complications of Tonsillectomy
**1. Hemorrhage (Most common and serious):**,
*   **Primary:** Occurs *during* surgery.
*   **Reactionary:** Occurs within **24 hours** (usually 6-12 hours). Caused by dislodgement of a clot, slippage of ligature, or return of normal BP (cessation of hypotensive anesthesia). Management: Remove clot, ligate vessel.
*   **Secondary:** Occurs between **5th–10th post-op day**. Due to **infection** and premature separation of slough. Management: Antibiotics; usually conservative.,

**2. Other Complications:**,,
*   Pain (referred otalgia via CN IX).
*   Infection (Parapharyngeal abscess).
*   Dental injury.
*   Lung complications (Aspiration of blood - **Coroner's Clot**).
*   [[Surgical Emphysema]].
*   Hypertrophy of lingual tonsil (compensatory).

**Clinical Implication:**
During tonsillectomy, the most common site of bleeding is the **Paratonsillar vein** (External palatine vein).
