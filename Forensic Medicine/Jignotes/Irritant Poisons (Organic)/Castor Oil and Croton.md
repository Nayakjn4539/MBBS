# [[Irritant Poisons (Organic)]] > Castor Oil and Croton

### **Ricinus Communis (Castor)**

**Common Names:** Castor oil plant, Arandi, Palma Christi.
**Classification:** Organic Vegetable Irritant [[Toxalbumin]].

#### **1. Physical Appearance**
*   **Plant:** Large shrub/small tree with greenish-red palmate leaves.
*   **Fruit:** Spiny capsule containing 3 seeds.
*   **Seeds:**
    *   **Shape:** Oval, flattened on one side.
    *   **Appearance:** Glossy/Shiny surface.
    *   **Pattern:** Mottled with brown/grey streaks (mosaic appearance).
    *   **Structure:** Has a distinct caruncle (white appendage) at one end.
    *   **Resemblance:** Looks like a tick (insect).

#### **2. Active Principles**
The toxicity depends on the part of the seed consumed.
1.  **[[Ricin]]:**
    *   A **Toxalbumin** (Phytotoxin).
    *   Present in the **seed pulp** (mash/cake) left after oil extraction.
    *   It is **Super Toxic** (comparable to cobra venom/anthrax).
    *   It is heat labile (destroyed by cooking).
2.  **[[Ricinoleic acid]]:**
    *   Present in the **Castor Oil**.
    *   It is a mild irritant/purgative but **Non-Toxic** (does not cause fatal poisoning) because Ricin does not pass into the oil during extraction.

#### **3. Mechanism of Action**
*   **Ricin:** It is a protoplasmic poison.
    *   Inhibits **protein synthesis** by interfering with [[RNA polymerase]]/Ribosomes.
    *   Causes agglutination and lysis of red blood cells ([[Hemolysis]]).
    *   Acts as an antigen (induces antibody formation - anti-ricin).
*   **Castor Oil:** Acts as a purgative due to irritation of the bowel.

#### **4. Clinical Features**
Symptoms usually appear after a **latent period** of several hours.
*   **Gastrointestinal:**
    *   Burning sensation in throat and stomach.
    *   Severe nausea and persistent vomiting.
    *   **Bloody diarrhea** (Dysenteric).
    *   Severe dehydration and thirst.
*   **Systemic:**
    *   Convulsions, drowsiness, and confusion.
    *   **Jaundice** (due to hemolysis and liver damage).
    *   **Uremia/Renal Failure** (due to blocked renal tubules by hemoglobin).
    *   Shock and circulatory collapse.
*   **If Inhaled (Powder):** Severe respiratory distress, pulmonary edema.

#### **5. Fatal Dose & Period**
*   **Fatal Dose:**
    *   **Seeds:** 5 to 10 seeds [Reddy]; approx 6 mg of Ricin.
    *   **Parenteral:** 1 mg/kg (highly lethal by injection).
*   **Fatal Period:** 3 to 5 days.

### **Croton Tiglium (Jamalgota)**

**Common Names:** Naepala, Jamalgota, Purging nut.
**Classification:** Organic Vegetable Irritant.

#### **1. Physical Appearance**
*   **Seeds:**
    *   **Shape:** Oval or oblong.
    *   **Appearance:** **Dull** surface (Not shiny).
    *   **Color:** Dark brown/blackish.
    *   **Pattern:** No mottling (linear longitudinal lines may be seen).
    *   **Resemblance:** Slightly resembles castor seeds but lacks the shine and mosaic pattern.

#### **2. Active Principles**
1.  **[[Crotin]]:**
    *   A **Toxalbumin**.
    *   Present in the seed kernel.
2.  **[[Croton Oil]]:**
    *   Contains **Crotonoleic acid**.
    *   Unlike castor oil, **Croton oil is highly poisonous**.
    *   It is a **Drastic Purgative** and a powerful **Vesicant** (blister forming).

#### **3. Clinical Features**
Unlike Castor, symptoms appear **immediately** or very rapidly.
*   **Ingestion:**
    *   Hot, burning sensation in the mouth, esophagus, and stomach.
    *   Salivation and vomiting.
    *   **Violent purging:** Profuse watery or bloody diarrhea causing exhaustion.
*   **Skin Contact (Oil/Paste):**
    *   It is a **Vesicant**.
    *   Causes redness, burning pain, and formation of **vesicles/blisters**.

#### **4. Fatal Dose & Period**
*   **Fatal Dose:**
    *   **Seeds:** 4 to 5 seeds.
    *   **Oil:** 1 to 2 ml.
*   **Fatal Period:** 4 to 6 hours (rarely up to 3 days).

### **Comparison: Castor vs. Croton Seeds**

| Feature | Castor Seeds (*Ricinus communis*) | Croton Seeds (*Croton tiglium*) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Appearance** | Shiny and Glossy | Dull and Non-shiny |
| **Color** | Mottled brown/grey (Mosaic) | Dark brown/Black (No mottling) |
| **Shape** | Oval/Flattened | Oval-Oblong |
| **Caruncle** | Distinct caruncle present | Caruncle small or absent |
| **Oil Toxicity** | Non-toxic (Purgative) | **Highly Toxic** (Drastic purgative & Vesicant) |
| **Toxalbumin** | Ricin | Crotin |

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw two seeds side by side. Castor seed should be shaded to show mottling and a shiny reflection. Croton seed should be shaded dark and solid without patterns.

### **Treatment (General for Organic Irritants)**

1.  **Decontamination:**
    *   [[Gastric Lavage]] with warm water and activated charcoal.
    *   Demulcents (milk, egg white) to soothe the mucosa.
2.  **Symptomatic:**
    *   Fluid and electrolyte replacement (IV fluids) to combat shock and dehydration.
    *   **Alkalinization of urine** (Sodium Bicarbonate) to prevent renal failure from hemoglobin casts (specifically for Castor/Ricin).
    *   Anti-spasmodics for cramps.

### **Medicolegal Aspects**

*   **Accidental Poisoning:** Most common. Children eat seeds due to attractive appearance (Castor) or mistaking them for edible nuts.
*   **Homicidal:**
    *   **Castor:** Rare by direct feeding due to bad taste. However, **Ricin** is a potential **Biological Weapon** (Bioterrorism). Famous case: **The Umbrella Murder** (Assassination of Georgi Markov using a ricin pellet injected via an umbrella tip).
    *   **Croton:** Rare, sometimes used to punish enemies by inducing severe diarrhea.
*   **Cattle Poison:** Both are used to kill cattle (needles/suis prepared from seeds).
*   **Abortifacient:** Both are used as abortifacients (Oral or local application to the OS).
*   **Arrow Poison:** Extracts used by tribes.

### **Autopsy Findings**

1.  **GI Tract:** Mucosa is congested, inflamed, softened, and eroded. Submucous hemorrhages (red velvet appearance).
2.  **Seed Fragments:** Fragments of seeds may be found in the stomach contents.
3.  **Specific to Ricin:** Agglutination of blood cells may be noted. Renal tubules may show blockage by hemoglobin casts.
4.  **Specific to Croton:** If applied locally/vaginally, blistering and inflammation of the contact area.

### **Mnemonic**

**"Castor is Colorfully Mottled, Croton is Colorless (Dull)."**

**RICIN Toxicity Features:**
*   **R** - Red blood cell lysis (Hemolysis)
*   **I** - Inhibition of Protein Synthesis
*   **C** - Cold/Clammy skin (Shock)
*   **I** - Intestinal Hemorrhage (Bloody diarrhea)
*   **N** - Necrosis of Kidneys
