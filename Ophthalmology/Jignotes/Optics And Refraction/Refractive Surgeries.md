# Refractive Surgeries

Refractive surgery aims to correct [[refractive errors]] (myopia, hypermetropia, astigmatism, and presbyopia) by modifying the refractive power of the eye, reducing dependence on spectacles or contact lenses,.

## Pre-requisites for Refractive Surgery
Before undergoing surgery, candidates must meet specific criteria to ensure safety and stability:
*   **Age:** Minimum 18 years (some sources suggest 20 or 21 years) to ensure growth has stabilized,.
*   **Refraction:** Stable refractive error for at least 1 year (no change > 0.5 D),,.
*   **Corneal Health:** Normal anterior segment, no pathologies like [[keratoconus]].
*   **Corneal Thickness:** Normal [[pachymetry]] reading (at least 490–500 microns),.
*   **Retina:** Normal retina with no pathologies; peripheral retinal degenerations must be treated beforehand.
*   **Systemic:** Not pregnant or lactating.

## Classification of Refractive Surgeries

## 1. Incisional Refractive Surgeries

### Radial Keratotomy (RK)
*   **Principle:** Deep radial incisions (90% corneal thickness) are made in the peripheral cornea leaving a central 4mm optical zone. This weakens the paracentral/peripheral cornea, causing it to bulge, which results in the flattening of the central cornea,.
*   **Indication:** Low to moderate [[myopia]] (2 to 6 D).
*   **Status:** Obsolete; rarely performed now due to unpredictability and complications,.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   Weakens the globe (risk of rupture in trauma).
    *   Diurnal fluctuation of vision.
    *   Hyperopic shift over time.

### Astigmatic Keratotomy (AK)
*   **Principle:** Transverse or arcuate incisions are made perpendicular to the steep meridian of the cornea,.
*   **Effect:** Produces localized ectasia/flattening of the incised steep meridian. Due to the "Coupling Effect", the meridian 90° away becomes steeper.
*   **Use:** Correction of [[astigmatism]].

## 2. Laser Refractive Surgeries (Cornea-Based)

These procedures primarily use the **Excimer Laser** (Argon-Fluoride, 193 nm) which works on the principle of **Photoablation** (breaking molecular bonds),.

### Photorefractive Keratectomy (PRK)
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Removal of corneal epithelium (mechanically or with laser).
    2.  Excimer laser ablation of Bowman’s membrane and anterior stroma to reshape curvature,.
*   **Indications:**
    *   Low to moderate myopia (up to -6 D).
    *   Thin corneas where LASIK is contraindicated.
    *   Patients prone to trauma (police, military) as there is no flap.
*   **Complications:** Post-operative pain (nerve endings exposed), delayed visual recovery, sub-epithelial corneal haze,.

### LASIK (Laser-Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis)
Currently the most popular refractive surgery.
*   **Procedure:** > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> LASIK steps - Flap creation, Laser ablation, Flap reposition
    1.  **Flap Creation:** A hinged flap of corneal tissue (epithelium + Bowman’s + anterior stroma) is raised using a **Microkeratome** or **[[Femtosecond Laser]]**,. Flap thickness is typically 130–160 microns.
    2.  **Laser Ablation:** Excimer laser ablates the mid-stromal bed to flatten (for myopia) or steepen (for hypermetropia) the cornea,.
    3.  **Reposition:** Flap is placed back without sutures.
*   **Correction Range:**
    *   Myopia: Up to -8 D to -12 D,.
    *   Hypermetropia: Up to +4 D,.
    *   Astigmatism: Up to 5 D.
*   **Safety Criteria:**
    *   **Residual Stromal Bed (RSB):** Must be >250 microns to prevent [[corneal ectasia]],.
    *   **Munnerlyn Formula:** Ablation depth = (Optical zone diameter)² × Diopters / 3.
*   **Contraindications:**
    *   Corneal thickness <450 microns,.
    *   Keratoconus.
    *   Unstable refraction.
    *   Dry eye (severe).
*   **Complications:**
    *   **Dry Eye:** Most common postoperative complication.
    *   **Flap related:** Button-holing, free cap, striae, dislocation.
    *   **DLK (Diffuse Lamellar Keratitis):** Also called "Sands of Sahara" syndrome.
    *   **Ectasia:** Iatrogenic keratoconus due to excessive thinning.

### Femto-LASIK (All-Laser LASIK)
*   Uses a [[Femtosecond laser]] (Nd:Glass, 1053 nm, infrared) instead of a mechanical blade for flap creation.
*   **Mechanism:** Photodisruption.
*   **Advantages:** More precise, uniform flap thickness, lower risk of flap complications compared to microkeratome.

### SMILE (Small Incision Lenticule Extraction)
*   **Procedure:** Uses **Femtosecond laser** only (No Excimer).
    1.  Laser cuts a refractory lenticule within the stroma.
    2.  A small incision (2-4mm) is made.
    3.  Lenticule is extracted, flattening the cornea,.
*   **Indications:** Myopia and astigmatism.
*   **Advantages:** "Flapless" surgery, biomechanically stronger cornea, less dry eye (fewer nerves severed),.

## 3. Lens-Based Refractive Surgeries

### Phakic Intraocular Lens (Phakic IOL / ICL)
*   **Definition:** Implantation of an artificial lens without removing the natural crystalline lens.
*   **Indication:** High myopia (> -8 D or > -12 D) not suitable for LASIK due to thin corneas,.
*   **Types:**
    *   **ICL (Implantable Collamer Lens):** Placed in the posterior chamber (ciliary sulcus) in front of the natural lens,.
    *   **Iris-claw lenses:** Fixed to the iris.
*   **Complications:** Endothelial damage, cataract formation, secondary [[glaucoma]], uveitis,.

### Refractive Lens Exchange (RLE) / Clear Lens Extraction (CLE)
*   **Procedure:** Removal of the non-cataractous natural lens and replacement with an IOL of appropriate power,.
*   **Indications:**
    *   High Myopia (> -12 D).
    *   High Hypermetropia (> +4 D),.
    *   Presbyopia (using multifocal IOLs).
*   **Risks:** Higher risk of **[[Retinal Detachment]]** in high myopes. Endophthalmitis, posterior capsule opacification.

## 4. Surgery for Presbyopia

*   **Cornea Based:**
    *   **Conductive Keratoplasty (CK):** Uses radiofrequency energy to shrink peripheral collagen, steepening the central cornea,. Used for low hypermetropia and presbyopia (monovision),.
    *   **PresbyLASIK:** Multifocal ablation profile on the cornea.
    *   **Monovision LASIK:** One eye corrected for distance, one for near.
    *   **Corneal Inlays:** Implants placed in corneal pockets (e.g., KAMRA).
*   **Lens Based:**
    *   **PRELEX (Presbyopic Lens Exchange):** Replacement of natural lens with Multifocal or Accommodative IOLs,.
