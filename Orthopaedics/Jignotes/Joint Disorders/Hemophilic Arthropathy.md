# [[Hemophilic Arthropathy]]

**Hemophilic Arthropathy** is a specific type of degenerative joint disease caused by recurrent bleeding into the joints ([[Hemarthrosis]]). It is the most common musculoskeletal manifestation of [[Hemophilia]].

### Etiology and Epidemiology
*   **Cause:** Deficiency of clotting factors.
    *   **[[Hemophilia A]]:** Deficiency of **[[Factor VIII]]** (Classical Hemophilia).
    *   **[[Hemophilia B]]:** Deficiency of **[[Factor IX]]** (Christmas Disease).
*   **Inheritance:** **X-linked recessive** disorder.
    *   Affects males almost exclusively.
    *   Females are carriers.
*   **Severity:** Directly correlates with the level of clotting factor activity (<1% is severe).

### Pathogenesis
The destruction of the joint is a result of recurrent [[Hemarthrosis]] (bleeding into the joint).

1.  **Acute Bleeding:** Trauma (often trivial) causes bleeding into the joint cavity.
2.  **Synovial Reaction:** The blood acts as an irritant. The synovium absorbs blood products (iron/[[Hemosiderin]]).
3.  **Chronic Synovitis:** Repeated bleeding leads to **synovial hypertrophy** and hypervascularity (making it more prone to bleed again—a vicious cycle).
4.  **Cartilage Destruction:**
    *   Iron deposition interferes with chondrocyte function.
    *   Release of lysosomal enzymes (proteolytic enzymes) from the inflamed synovium destroys the [[Articular Cartilage]].
5.  **Bone Damage:** Hyperemia causes juxta-articular osteoporosis. Subchondral bone cysts form due to the intrusion of synovial tissue.
6.  **End Stage:** Fibrous or bony [[Ankylosis]] and joint destruction.

### Clinical Features
The clinical presentation varies by the stage of the disease.

#### 1. Acute Hemarthrosis
*   **Symptoms:** Sudden onset of severe pain, warmth, and tightness in the joint.
*   **Signs:**
    *   The joint is tense, tender, and hot.
    *   Held in a **position of ease** (usually flexion) to accommodate the fluid volume.
    *   Movement is extremely painful and restricted.

#### 2. Chronic Hemophilic Arthropathy
*   **Symptoms:** Chronic pain, morning stiffness, and disability.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Muscle Atrophy:** Significant wasting of muscles (e.g., quadriceps in knee involvement).
    *   **Deformity:** Fixed flexion deformities are common.
    *   **Crepitus:** Due to cartilage loss.
    *   **Enlargement:** The joint appears enlarged due to bony overgrowth and synovial thickening.

#### Sites of Involvement
*   **[[Knee Joint]]:** Most common site.
*   **[[Elbow Joint]]:** Second most common.
*   **[[Ankle Joint]]**.
*   Shoulder and Hip are less frequently involved.

### Specific Entity: [[Hemophilic Pseudotumor]]
This is a rare but serious complication occurring in 1–2% of severe hemophiliacs.
*   **Definition:** An encapsulated, chronic, slowly expanding hematoma.
*   **Location:**
    *   **Subperiosteal:** Causes pressure necrosis and destruction of the underlying bone.
    *   **Intramuscular:** Commonly in the **[[Iliopsoas]]** or **[[Quadriceps]]**.
*   **Radiology:** Large cystic destruction of bone with a soft tissue mass.
*   **Clinical Feature:** Can mimic a malignant bone tumor (e.g., [[Osteosarcoma]] or [[Ewing’s Sarcoma]]).

### Radiological Features
X-rays are diagnostic in established cases.

#### General Findings
*   **Juxta-articular Osteopenia:** Due to local hyperemia.
*   **Subchondral Cysts:** Due to interosseous bleeding or synovial intrusion.
*   **Joint Space Narrowing:** Due to cartilage loss.

#### Joint-Specific Findings (Exam High-Yield)

| Joint | Characteristic X-ray Features |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Knee]]** | • **[[Squaring of Patella]]**: (Flattening of the lower pole).<br>• **[[Widening of Intercondylar Notch]]**: Due to synovial hypertrophy overgrowing into the notch.<br>• **Bulbous enlargement** of femoral condyles (epiphyseal overgrowth). |
| **[[Elbow]]** | • Enlargement of the **[[Radial Head]]**.<br>• Widening of the trochlear notch of the [[Ulna]]. |
| **[[Ankle]]** | • Talar flattening.<br>• Tibial osteophytes. |

### Investigations
1.  **Clotting Profile:**
    *   **APTT (Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time):** Prolonged.
    *   **PT (Prothrombin Time):** Normal.
    *   **Bleeding Time:** Normal.
    *   **Factor Assays:** Decreased Factor VIII or IX.
2.  **Imaging:**
    *   **X-ray:** For bony changes (See above).
    *   **MRI:** Best for assessing early synovial changes and cartilage integrity.

### Treatment

#### 1. Management of Acute Hemarthrosis
*   **Factor Replacement:** Immediate infusion of the deficient factor ([[Factor VIII]] or IX) to stop bleeding. **This is the priority.**
*   **RICE Protocol:**
    *   **R**est (Immobilization in functional position).
    *   **I**ce packs (Cryotherapy to reduce pain and inflammation).
    *   **C**ompression (Bandage).
    *   **E**levation.
*   **Aspiration:**
    *   *Controversial.* Generally avoided to prevent infection.
    *   **Indication:** Only if the joint is tensely swollen with severe pain and conservative measures fail.
    *   **Pre-requisite:** Must be done under strict asepsis and **after** factor replacement cover.

#### 2. Management of Chronic Arthropathy
*   **Conservative:**
    *   Physiotherapy to maintain range of motion and muscle strength.
    *   Analgesics (Avoid Aspirin/NSAIDs that affect platelet function; COX-2 inhibitors like Celecoxib are safer).
    *   Orthotics/Splints to prevent deformity.
*   **Synovectomy:**
    *   Indicated for recurrent hemarthrosis despite medical management.
    *   **Chemical/Radio-synovectomy:** Injection of Rifampicin or radioactive isotopes (e.g., Yttrium-90) to ablate the synovium.
    *   **Surgical Synovectomy:** Arthroscopic or open.
*   **Corrective Surgery:**
    *   **Osteotomy:** To correct angular deformities.
    *   **[[Total Joint Arthroplasty]] (Replacement):** For end-stage arthritis. High risk of bleeding and infection; requires aggressive factor coverage.
    *   **[[Arthrodesis]] (Fusion):** For ankle or smaller joints.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Warning:** Never perform a muscle release or surgery in a hemophiliac without checking factor levels and correcting them.
*   **[[Iliopsoas Hematoma]]:** Can compress the [[Femoral Nerve]], causing femoral neuropathy. The patient presents with the hip in flexion (psoas spasm). Extension causes pain.
