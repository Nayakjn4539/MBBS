# Non-union of Fractures

### Definition
**Non-union** is defined as a condition where a fracture fails to unite and will not unite without further intervention. It represents the cessation of all reparative processes of healing.
*   **Timeframe:** While definitions vary, it is generally accepted when a minimum of **9 months** has elapsed since injury and the fracture shows no visible progressive signs of healing for **3 months**.
*   **Pseudarthrosis:** In some cases of non-union, a false joint forms at the fracture site, lined by a synovial-like membrane and containing fluid. This is termed [[Pseudarthrosis]].

### Classification (Muller and Weber)
Non-unions are broadly classified based on the viability of the bone ends and the presence of callus.

| Type | Sub-types | Characteristics | Cause |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hypertrophic** (Hypervascular) | 1. Elephant foot<br>2. Horse hoof<br>3. Oligotrophic | • Vascular bone ends<br>• Callus formation present<br>• Bone ends flare out (sclerotic) | • Inadequate immobilization<br>• Excessive motion<br>• Premature weight-bearing |
| **Atrophic** (Avascular) | 1. Torsion wedge<br>2. Comminuted<br>3. Defect<br>4. Atrophic | • Avascular/inert bone ends<br>• No callus formation<br>• Bone ends are tapered/osteoporotic | • Poor blood supply<br>• Severe soft tissue damage<br>• Gap between fragments<br>• Infection |

### Etiology and Risk Factors
Factors predisposing to non-union can be patient-related, injury-related, or treatment-related.

**Mnemonics: N-O-N-U-N-I-O-N**
*   **N** - **N**ecrosis (Poor blood supply, e.g., [[Scaphoid]], [[Femoral Neck]], Distal [[Tibia]])
*   **O** - **O**pen fractures (Severe soft tissue damage)
*   **N** - **N**utrition (Poor nutrition, Vitamin D deficiency)
*   **U** - **U**nstable fixation (Inadequate immobilization)
*   **N** - **N**icotine (Smoking causes vasoconstriction)
*   **I** - **I**nfection (Osteomyelitis)
*   **O** - **O**ff-position (Distraction of fragments or soft tissue interposition)
*   **N** - **N**on-compliance (Patient removes splint/bears weight too early)

### Clinical Features
The clinical presentation of non-union differs from acute fractures.
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Usually painless or minimal pain (unless stressed or infected).
    *   Loss of function.
    *   Perceived instability by the patient.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Painless abnormal mobility** in atrophic types.
    *   **Gap** may be palpable.
    *   No acute tenderness (unless infected).
    *   Muscle wasting and deformity.
    *   Scarring or sinuses (in infected cases).

### Radiological Features
Plain **X-rays** (AP and Lateral) are the primary investigation.
*   Visible fracture line (gap).
*   Sclerosis of bone ends.
*   Obliteration of the [[Medullary Canal]] at fracture ends.
*   **Hypertrophic:** Broad, sclerotic ends with "Elephant foot" callus.
*   **Atrophic:** Tapered, osteoporotic ends (resembling a sucked candy stick) with no callus.
*   **Infected:** Presence of **sequestrum** (dead bone), lysis, or periosteal reaction.

### Management Principles
The treatment depends entirely on the type of non-union.

#### 1. Hypertrophic Non-union
*   **Biology is Good, Stability is Bad.**
*   **Goal:** Provide rigid stability.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Functional Bracing:** May induce union in early stages.
    *   **Rigid Internal Fixation:** Compression plating or [[Intramedullary Nailing]].
    *   **Bone grafting** is usually **NOT** required as the bone is biologically active.

#### 2. Atrophic Non-union
*   **Biology is Bad, Stability is Variable.**
*   **Goal:** Improve biology (osteogenesis) and provide stability.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Fixation:** Rigid internal or external fixation.
    *   **Decortication:** Shingling the bone to stimulate bleeding/healing.
    *   **[[Bone Grafting]]:** Essential.
        *   *Autograft:* Iliac crest (Gold standard).
        *   *Allograft:* Bone bank.
        *   *Bone Marrow Injection:* Aspirated marrow injected into the site.

#### 3. Infected Non-union
*   **Goal:** Eradicate infection first, then achieve union.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Debridement:** Removal of dead bone (sequestrum), infected implants, and soft tissue.
    *   **Antibiotics:** Systemic and local (antibiotic beads).
    *   **Stability:** Usually **External Fixation** (e.g., [[Ilizarov Fixator]]) is preferred over internal fixation in active infection.
    *   **Bone Transport:** If a large gap is created after debridement, the Ilizarov technique is used to transport a healthy segment of bone across the defect.

### Adjunct Modalities
Used to stimulate bone formation, particularly in delayed union or as an adjunct to surgery.
*   **Electrical Stimulation:** Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields (PEMF).
*   **Low-intensity Pulsed Ultrasound (LIPUS).**
*   **Bone Morphogenetic Proteins ([[BMPs]]):** Biological stimulants.

### Clinical Implications
*   **"Fracture of Necessity":** Certain fractures (e.g., [[Galeazzi fracture]], [[Monteggia fracture]], Femoral Neck) have high rates of non-union with conservative care and almost always require surgery.
*   **Scaphoid Fractures:** Ideally treated with cast, but high risk of non-union due to retrograde blood supply leading to [[Avascular Necrosis]] of the proximal pole.
*   **Tibia Fractures:** The distal 1/3rd of the tibia is a common site for non-union due to poor subcutaneous blood supply.
