# **Acute Congestive Glaucoma (Acute Angle Closure Crisis)**

[[Acute Congestive Glaucoma]] (ACG), also known as **Acute Primary Angle Closure (APAC)**, is an ophthalmic emergency caused by a sudden, total occlusion of the angle of the anterior chamber by the root of the iris. This blockage prevents aqueous outflow, leading to a rapid and severe rise in [[Intraocular Pressure]] (IOP).

---

### **Etiopathogenesis**

#### **1. Anatomical Predisposing Factors**
Certain eyes are anatomically predisposed to angle closure. These features are often bilateral.
*   **Hypermetropia:** Small, short eyes with a short [[Axial Length]].
*   **Shallow Anterior Chamber:** Both central and peripheral shallowing.
*   **Narrow Angle:** [[Gonioscopy]] reveals occludable angles (Grade 0–1).
*   **Lens Factors:** Relative anterior position of the [[Lens-Iris Diaphragm]] or a large/intumescent lens crowding the angle.
*   **Demographics:** More common in women (3:1 to 4:1 ratio) and typically presents in the 5th to 7th decade of life.,

#### **2. Precipitating Factors**
Factors that cause **mid-dilatation** of the pupil bring the iris into maximum contact with the lens, precipitating the attack:,
*   **Physiological Mydriasis:** Dim illumination (e.g., movie theaters), anxiety, emotional stress (sympathetic overactivity).
*   **Pharmacological Mydriasis:** Use of topical mydriatics (e.g., [[Tropicamide]], [[Atropine]]) or systemic drugs with anticholinergic side effects (antidepressants, antihistamines).

#### **3. Mechanism: Pupillary Block**
*   **Relative Pupillary Block:** The iris rests against the anterior surface of the lens, hindering the flow of aqueous humor from the posterior chamber to the [[Anterior Chamber]].
*   **Iris Bombe:** Pressure builds up in the posterior chamber, causing the peripheral iris to bow forward.
*   **Angle Closure:** The bowed iris blocks the [[Trabecular Meshwork]], leading to a sudden spike in IOP.

### **Clinical Features**

#### **Symptoms**
The onset is sudden and dramatic.
*   **Severe Pain:** Excruciating pain in the eye, radiating to the forehead and head (along the distribution of the [[Trigeminal Nerve]]).
*   **Nausea and Vomiting:** Due to vagal stimulation (often mistaken for an acute abdomen or migraine).
*   **Rapid Vision Loss:** Due to corneal edema and ischemia.
*   **Colored Halos:** Rainbow-colored halos seen around lights (due to prismatic dispersion of light by [[Corneal Edema]]).
*   **Redness and Photophobia.**

#### **Signs**
| Structure | Clinical Finding |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Lids** | Edematous and swollen. |
| **Conjunctiva** | Chemosis and marked **ciliary congestion** (circumcorneal). |
| **Cornea** | **Steamy/Hazy** due to epithelial edema; insensitive to touch., |
| **Anterior Chamber** | Very **shallow**; flare and cells may be present. |
| **Angle** | Completely closed (Shaffer Grade 0) on [[Gonioscopy]]. |
| **Iris** | May appear discolored/muddy; **Iris Bombe** may be present. |
| **Pupil** | **Vertically oval**, mid-dilated, and **fixed** (non-reactive to light)., |
| **Lens** | **[[Glaukomflecken]]** (gray-white anterior subcapsular opacities due to epithelial ischemia/necrosis)., |
| **IOP** | Markedly elevated, usually **40–70 mmHg**; eyeball feels "stony hard" on digital tonometry., |
| **Fellow Eye** | Usually shows a shallow anterior chamber and narrow angle (occludable). |

**Clinical Implication:** The fellow eye is at a 50% risk of developing an acute attack if left untreated. Prophylactic treatment is mandatory.

### **Differential Diagnosis**

It is crucial to distinguish Acute ACG from other causes of a "Red Eye."

| Feature | **Acute Congestive Glaucoma** | **Acute Iridocyclitis (Uveitis)** | **Acute Conjunctivitis** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pain** | Severe, radiating, with vomiting | Moderate, radiating | Mild discomfort/gritty |
| **Vision** | Markedly impaired | Slightly impaired | Normal/Good |
| **Congestion** | Deep ciliary | Deep ciliary | Superficial conjunctival |
| **Pupil** | **Vertically oval, mid-dilated, fixed** | **Small, irregular** | Normal |
| **Cornea** | Hazy (edema), insensitive | KPs usually present | Clear |
| **Anterior Chamber** | Very Shallow | Normal or deep | Normal |
| **IOP** | Markedly Raised (+++) | Normal/Low (sometimes raised) | Normal |
| **Discharge** | Watery | Watery | Mucopurulent |

### **Management**

Acute ACG is a **medical emergency**. The goal is to lower IOP rapidly to prevent optic nerve damage and clear the cornea for definitive laser treatment.

#### **1. Immediate Medical Therapy (To lower IOP)**
*   **Systemic Hyperosmotics (First Line):**
    *   **IV [[Mannitol]] (20%):** 1-2 g/kg body weight given rapidly over 30 mins. Dehydrates the vitreous.
    *   **Oral Glycerol:** If patient is not vomiting (caution in diabetics).
*   **Systemic Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors (CAIs):**
    *   **[[Acetazolamide]] (Diamox):** 500 mg IV stat, followed by 250 mg oral tablets. Reduces aqueous production.
*   **Topical Antiglaucoma Agents:**
    *   **Beta-blockers:** [[Timolol]] 0.5%.
    *   **Alpha-agonists:** [[Brimonidine]] 0.1-0.2%.
    *   **Steroids:** [[Prednisolone Acetate]] 1% to reduce inflammation and sphincter ischemia.

#### **2. Role of Miotics ([[Pilocarpine]])**
*   **Timing:** Should be started *only after* IOP is lowered (usually after 1 hour of systemic therapy).
*   **Reason:** At very high pressures (>40 mmHg), the iris sphincter is ischemic and paralyzed; Pilocarpine will be ineffective. Once IOP drops, Pilocarpine 2% constricts the pupil, pulling the peripheral iris away from the trabecular meshwork (opening the angle).,
*   **Dosage:** 2% drops QID. Avoid intensive use to prevent toxicity.

#### **3. Definitive Treatment: Laser Peripheral Iridotomy (LPI)**
*   **Procedure:** Once the cornea clears, **Nd:YAG Laser Iridotomy** is performed.
*   **Mechanism:** Creates a hole in the peripheral iris, re-establishing communication between the posterior and anterior chambers. This bypasses the pupillary block, equalizing pressure and allowing the iris to fall back.
*   **Timing:** As soon as possible.
*   **Fellow Eye:** **Prophylactic LPI** must be done in the unaffected eye to prevent an attack.

#### **4. Surgical Management**
If medical management and LPI fail, or if there are extensive [[Peripheral Anterior Synechiae]] (PAS > 270°):
*   **[[Trabeculectomy]]:** Filtration surgery.
*   **Lens Extraction:** Early cataract extraction (phacoemulsification) may be considered, especially if there is a phacomorphic component.

### **Sequelae of Acute ACG**

If the attack is prolonged or untreated, permanent damage occurs:
1.  **Glaukomflecken:** Diagnostic anterior subcapsular lens opacities (due to necrosis of lens epithelium from high pressure).
2.  **Iris Atrophy:** Sectoral stromal atrophy.
3.  **Pupil Distortion:** Permanently dilated, non-reactive pupil.
4.  **Chronic ACG:** Development of permanent Peripheral Anterior Synechiae (PAS).
5.  **[[Absolute Glaucoma]]:** Painful, blind eye with high IOP.
