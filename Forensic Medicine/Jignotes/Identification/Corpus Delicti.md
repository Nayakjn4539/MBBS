# [[Identification]] > Corpus Delicti

### Definition
**Corpus Delicti** is a Latin term that literally translates to **"The Body of the Offence"** or "The Body of the Crime". 

It does **not** refer merely to the actual dead body of the deceased, but rather to the **essence of the crime** itself. It is the principle that a crime must be proved to have actually occurred before a person can be convicted of committing that crime.

### Components of Corpus Delicti
In a charge of [[Homicide]] (Murder), establishing Corpus Delicti involves proving the following two fundamental facts:
1.  **Positive Identification:** The identity of the victim (dead body) must be established beyond doubt.
2.  **Criminal Act:** It must be proven that the death was caused by the criminal act of the accused (and not by natural causes, accident, or suicide).

### Scope and Constituents
The term is comprehensive and includes the following physical evidences found at the scene or during investigation:
*   The **body** of the victim itself.
*   **Trace evidence** such as a bullet recovered from the body.
*   **Clothing** showing marks of the weapon (e.g., stab cuts, gunshot holes).
*   **Photographs** showing fatal injuries.
*   Other biological traces or weapons.

### Establishment of Corpus Delicti
The burden of proof lies with the prosecution. It can be established by:
*   **Direct Evidence:** Testimony of eyewitnesses.
*   **Medical Evidence:** [[Medicolegal Autopsy]] findings confirming the cause and manner of death (e.g., differentiation between antemortem and postmortem injuries).
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** In cases where the body is destroyed (e.g., acid bath, burning, dismemberment) or not found, the law may still convict based on strong circumstantial evidence, provided the chain of custody and logic is unbroken.

### Medicolegal Aspects
*   **Identification:** Positive [[Identification]] of the dead body is the first step in establishing Corpus Delicti. If the body cannot be identified, proving homicide becomes extremely difficult.
*   **Crime Scene Investigation:** Proper investigation of the crime scene aids in establishing the *corpus delicti* by associating the victim, suspect, scene, and evidence.
*   **Autopsy:** The primary role of the autopsy surgeon is to determine the [[Cause of Death]] and rule out natural causes to support the claim of a criminal act.
*   **Legal Necessity:** Without establishing Corpus Delicti, there can be no conviction for a crime.

### Mnemonic
To remember the essence of **CORPUS**:
*   **C** - **C**rime must be proven
*   **O** - **O**ffence ("Body of Offence")
*   **R** - **R**emains (Identification of body)
*   **P** - **P**roof of death
*   **U** - **U**nlawful act (Criminal agency)
*   **S** - **S**ubstantiating evidence (Bullets, clothes, etc.)
