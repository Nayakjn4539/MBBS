### Biological Filter (Slow Sand Filter)

In the context of water purification, a **Biological Filter** is synonymous with the **Slow Sand Filter**. It is a standard method of water treatment that relies primarily on biological processes to purify water, distinguishing it from Rapid Sand (Mechanical) filters.

**1. Definition**
A biological filter is a water purification system where water passes slowly through a bed of fine sand, utilizing a biological film (vital layer) to remove impurities and microorganisms.

**2. Key Elements of Construction**
A typical biological filter consists of a watertight box (2.5 to 4 meters deep) containing the following components:

*   **Supernatant (Raw) Water:**
    *   **Depth:** 1 to 1.5 meters standing above the sand bed.
    *   **Function:** Provides a constant head of pressure to push water through the sand and allows time (3–12 hours) for partial purification via sedimentation and oxidation.
*   **Sand Bed:**
    *   This is the most crucial part.
    *   **Thickness:** Approximately 1.2 meters.
    *   **Sand Grain Size:** Fine grains with an effective diameter of **0.2 – 0.3 mm**.
    *   **Surface Area:** Provides a massive surface area for purification (approx. 15,000 $m^2$ per $m^3$ of sand).
*   **Under-drainage System:**
    *   Located at the bottom, consisting of porous or perforated pipes covered by graded gravel (30-40 cm).
    *   **Function:** Supports the sand bed and collects filtered water.
*   **Filter Control System:**
    *   Equipped with valves and a **[[Venturi meter]]** to measure "loss of head" (bed resistance) and regulate the filtration rate.

**3. The Vital Layer ([[Schmutzdecke]])**
This is the "Heart" of the biological filter.
*   **Formation:** When a new filter is started, it acts only as a mechanical strainer. Over several days, a slimy, gelatinous film forms on the surface of the sand bed. This process is called **"Ripening"**.
*   **Composition:** It consists of thread-like algae, plankton, diatoms, and bacteria (zoogleal organisms).
*   **Function:** It is the true purifying agent. It removes organic matter, holds back bacteria, and oxidizes ammoniacal nitrogen into nitrates. It extends 2–3 cm into the top sand layer.

**4. Mechanisms of Purification**
The biological filter purifies water through four distinct processes:
*   **Sedimentation:** Suspended particles settle in the supernatant water.
*   **Mechanical Straining:** Fine sand stops larger particles.
*   **Adsorption:** Particles adhere to the sand grains.
*   **Biological Action:** The vital layer and soil bacteria oxidize organic matter and kill pathogens.

**5. Operation and Maintenance**
*   **Rate of Filtration:** Slow, approximately **0.1 – 0.4 $m^3$/hour/sq. m** (or 2–3 million gallons per acre per day).
*   **Filter Cleaning:**
    *   Unlike rapid sand filters, biological filters are **not backwashed**.
    *   When bed resistance increases (loss of head exceeds 1.3 m), the supernatant water is drained, and the top **1–2 cm** of the sand bed (containing the vital layer) is **scraped off**.
    *   The filter is then restarted, but the filtrate is discarded for a few days until the vital layer reforms (re-ripening).

**6. Efficiency and Advantages**
*   **Bacterial Removal:** Highly efficient; removes **99.9% to 99.99%** of bacteria.
*   **E. coli Removal:** 99 to 99.9% reduction.
*   **Simplicity:** Simple to construct and cheaper to operate than rapid sand filters.
*   **Skill Level:** Requires less skilled operation.
*   **Turbidity:** Good removal of turbidity.

**7. Disadvantages**
*   **Space:** Occupies a large surface area.
*   **Speed:** Filtration rate is slow (40–50 times slower than rapid sand filters).
*   **Unsuitability:** Not suitable for highly turbid water without preliminary sedimentation.

**Mnemonic for Purification Mechanisms: SOBA**
*   **S**edimentation
*   **O**xidation
*   **B**acterial Action
*   **A**dsorption/Mechanical Straining
