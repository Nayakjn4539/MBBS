# [[Identification]] > Sex from skeletal remains

### General Considerations
Determination of sex from [[skeletal remains]] is a crucial step in the identification of a deceased individual. It is generally not possible to determine sex with certainty before puberty because secondary sexual characteristics in bones do not develop until then,.

**Accuracy of Sex Determination ([[Krogman's accuracy]])**,
The degree of accuracy depends on the number of bones available for examination:
*   **Entire skeleton:** 100%
*   **Pelvis + Skull:** 98%
*   **Pelvis alone:** 95%
*   **Skull alone:** 90–92%
*   **Long bones:** 80–85%

### 1. The Pelvis
The [[pelvis]] is the **most reliable** bone for sex determination because of the anatomical adaptations required for childbearing in females.

#### Morphological Differences
| Feature | Male Pelvis | Female Pelvis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **General Structure** | Heavy, rough, massive, with marked muscle attachments | Light, smooth, less massive |
| **Pelvic Inlet** | Heart-shaped (android) | Circular or Elliptical (gynecoid), |
| **Pelvic Cavity** | Conical/Funnel-shaped (deep) | Cylindrical/Bowl-shaped (shallow and roomy) |
| **Subpubic Angle** | V-shaped, Acute (70–75°) | U-shaped, Obtuse (90–100°) |
| **Greater Sciatic Notch** | Narrow, deep (Inverted J shape) | Wide, shallow (Inverted L shape), |
| **Pre-auricular Sulcus** | Rare/Shallow | Frequently present and deep (pregnancy scar) |
| **Acetabulum** | Large, directed laterally | Small, directed anterolaterally |
| **Obturator Foramen** | Large, oval/ovoid | Small, triangular |
| **Ilium** | High, vertical (walls of false pelvis) | Low, divergent/flared laterally |
| **Pubic Body** | Triangular/Narrow | Rectangular/Broad |

*   **Mnemonic for Pelvis:** **LADIES**
    *   **L** - **L**arge inlet
    *   **A** - **A**ngle (Subpubic) is wide
    *   **D** - **D**iameter of outlet is large
    *   **I** - **I**lium is flared
    *   **E** - **E**xtra groove (Pre-auricular sulcus)
    *   **S** - **S**ciatic notch is wide

#### Important Indices
1.  **Sciatic Notch Index:** Width × 100 / Depth
    *   Male: 4–5
    *   Female: 5–6
2.  **Ischiopubic Index (Washburn's Index):** Length of pubis × 100 / Length of ischium
    *   Male: < 90 (Ischium is longer than pubis)
    *   Female: > 95 (Pubis is longer than ischium)

### 2. The Skull
The [[skull]] is the second most valuable bone for sexing. Male skulls are generally rugged with prominent sites for muscle attachment, while female skulls are smoother and more gracile.

| Feature | Male Skull | Female Skull |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Size/Capacity** | Larger (approx. 1450 cc) | Smaller (approx. 1300 cc) |
| **Glabella/Supraorbital ridges** | Prominent | Less prominent/Smooth |
| **Frontal Eminence** | Small/Indistinct | Prominent |
| **Parietal Eminence** | Small/Indistinct | Prominent |
| **Forehead** | Sloping/Receding | Vertical |
| **Orbital aperture** | Square, set lower, rounded margins | Round, set higher, sharp margins |
| **Mastoid Process** | Large, blunt, rough | Small, pointed, smooth |
| **Zygomatic Arch** | Stout, extends past auditory meatus | Slender, does not extend past auditory meatus |
| **Occipital Protuberance** | Prominent | Not prominent/Smooth |
| **Digastric Groove** | Deep | Shallow |

### 3. The Mandible
The [[mandible]] acts as a reliable adjunct to the skull.

| Feature | Male Mandible | Female Mandible |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **General Size** | Larger, thicker, heavier | Smaller, thinner, lighter |
| **Chin (Mental Protuberance)** | Square (U-shaped) | Rounded/Pointed (V-shaped), |
| **Gonial Angle (Angle of Jaw)** | Everted, less obtuse (<125°) | Inverted, more obtuse (>125°), |
| **Condyles** | Large | Small |

### 4. The Sternum
Sex determination from the [[sternum]] relies heavily on the length of the manubrium and the body (mesosternum).

*   **Length of Body:** In males, the body is more than twice the length of the manubrium. In females, it is less than twice the length.
*   **Ashley's Rule of 149:**
    *   Total length (Manubrium + Body) > 149 mm = **Male**
    *   Total length (Manubrium + Body) < 149 mm = **Female**,

### 5. The Sacrum
| Feature | Male Sacrum | Female Sacrum |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Length** | Longer, narrower | Shorter, wider |
| **Curvature** | Uniform curve (C-shape) | Abrupt curve at S1-S2, straight below |
| **Promontory** | Prominent | Less prominent |
| **Corporobasal Index** | > 45% (Body of S1 is wider) | < 40% (Alae are wider) |

*Formula for Corporobasal Index:* (Width of body of S1 × 100) / Width of base of sacrum.

### 6. Long Bones
Measurements of the head of the [[femur]] and [[humerus]] are useful. Generally, male bones are heavier, thicker, and have more prominent ridges for muscle attachment.

*   **Femur Head Diameter:**
    *   Male: > 48 mm
    *   Female: < 42 mm
*   **Humerus Head Vertical Diameter:**
    *   Male: > 47 mm
    *   Female: < 43 mm

### Medico-legal Aspects
*   **Identification:** Essential in cases of mass disasters (explosions, aircraft accidents), mutilated bodies found in crimes, or decomposed bodies where soft tissue is absent.
*   **Exhumation:** Sex determination confirms if the correct body has been exhumed when identity is in question.
*   **Intersex:** In cases of doubtful sex, skeletal analysis (especially pelvis) can provide clues regarding the genetic sex, though DNA analysis is definitive.
