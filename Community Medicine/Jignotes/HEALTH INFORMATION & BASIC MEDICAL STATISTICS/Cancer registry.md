# [[HEALTH INFORMATION & BASIC MEDICAL STATISTICS]] > Cancer registry

### **CANCER REGISTRY**

**Definition**
A [[cancer registry]] is an information system designed for the collection, storage, analysis, and interpretation of data on persons with cancer.
*   The term **"registration"** implies something more than "notification".
*   A register requires that a **permanent record** be established, that cases be **followed up**, and that basic statistical tabulations be prepared on frequency and survival.

### **Types of Cancer Registries**

There are two basic types of cancer registries:

#### **1. Hospital-Based Cancer Registries (HBCR)**
*   **Definition:** These registries record all cancer cases treated in a specific hospital/institution, regardless of where the patient resides.
*   **Primary Function:** To improve patient care and hospital administration.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Includes in-patients and out-patients.
    *   Provides data on the clinical management of patients and the efficacy of different treatment modalities.
    *   **Limitation:** The population is "selected" (biased), so these registries **cannot** provide a true [[incidence rate]] or epidemiological profile of cancer in the general community.

#### **2. Population-Based Cancer Registries (PBCR)**
*   **Definition:** These registries collect data on all new cancer cases occurring in a defined population within a specific geographic area.
*   **Primary Function:** Public health and epidemiology.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   The aim is to cover the **complete cancer situation** in a given area.
    *   The optimum size of the base population for a PBCR is in the range of **2–7 million**.
    *   **Utility:** Data from these registries provide the **incidence rate** of cancer and serve as a tool for epidemiological enquiries, surveillance of time trends, and planning control activities.

### **Comparison: Hospital vs. Population-Based Registry**

| Feature | **Hospital-Based Registry (HBCR)** | **Population-Based Registry (PBCR)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Focus** | Clinical care and Hospital admin | Public Health and [[Epidemiology]] |
| **Data Source** | Patients within a specific hospital | All cases in a specific geographic area |
| **Key Metric** | Survival rates, Quality of care | **Incidence Rates**, Time trends |
| **Denominator** | Not defined (Selected population) | Defined population (Census data) |
| **Utility** | Assessing treatment efficacy | Planning prevention/control programs |

### **National Cancer Registry Programme (NCRP)**

The [[Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)]] initiated the NCRP in **1982** to generate authentic data on the cancer burden in India.

**Objectives of NCRP:**
1.  **Generation of authentic data:** To provide incidence data on cancer in defined areas.
2.  **Epidemiological investigations:** To conduct case-control studies on site-specific cancers.
3.  **Intervention programs:** To design and evaluate control measures in registry areas.

**Current Network (Examples):**
*   **Population-Based:** Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Bhopal, Delhi, and Barshi (Rural).
*   **Hospital-Based:** Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Thiruvananthapuram, Dibrugarh.

> **Note:** The Mumbai, Bangalore, and Chennai registries function as *both* hospital and population-based registries.

### **Mnemonics for Uses of Cancer Registry**

**"REGISTRY"**

*   **R** - **R**isk factor identification
*   **E** - **E**pidemiological studies (Incidence/Prevalence)
*   **G** - **G**oals for prevention planning
*   **I** - **I**mprovement of patient care (Hospital based)
*   **S** - **S**urvival analysis
*   **T** - **T**ime trends monitoring
*   **R** - **R**esource allocation
*   **Y** - **Y**ield of screening programs (Evaluation)

---

### **Clinical Relevance**

*   **Prognosis:** Registries, especially hospital-based ones with long-term follow-up, are essential for calculating **5-year survival rates**. This helps oncologists assess the prognosis of specific cancers and the effectiveness of new treatment protocols (e.g., chemotherapy vs. radiation).
*   **Screening Evaluation:** Population registries help evaluate if screening programs (like Pap smears or mammography) are actually reducing the incidence of invasive cancer in the community.
