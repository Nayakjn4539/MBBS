# [[PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IN OBSTETRICS, PAEDIATRICS AND GERIATRICS]] > Define Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR). Outline of the strategies under national programme to bring down the maternal mortality in India. Give a brief account of Maternal Death Review at community level.

### 1. Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)

**Definition:**
[[Maternal Mortality Ratio]] (MMR) is defined as the number of **maternal deaths** during a given time period per **100,000 live births** during the same time period.

**Formula:**
$$MMR = \frac{\text{Total number of maternal deaths in a given year}}{\text{Total number of live births in the same year}} \times 100,000$$

**Key Components of Definition:**
*   **Maternal Death:** The death of a woman while pregnant or within **42 days** of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but **not** from accidental or incidental causes.
*   **Nature of Indicator:** It is a **Ratio**, not a rate, because the numerator (maternal deaths) is not a part of the denominator (live births). It essentially captures the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live births.

### 2. Strategies Under National Programme to Reduce Maternal Mortality

The Government of India, under the [[National Health Mission]] (NHM) and the [[RMNCAH+N]] strategy (Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child, Adolescent Health and Nutrition), has implemented a multi-pronged approach to lower MMR.

**A. Schemes for Institutional Delivery and Financial Support**
1.  **[[Janani Suraksha Yojana]] (JSY):** A conditional cash transfer scheme to promote institutional deliveries, especially among poor pregnant women in low-performing states.
2.  **[[Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram]] (JSSK):** Entitles all pregnant women delivering in public health institutions to **free delivery** (including C-section), free drugs/consumables, free diet, free diagnostics, and **free transport** (home to facility, referral, and drop back).
3.  **[[Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan]] (PMSMA):** Provides fixed-day, free, assured, and quality antenatal care (including investigations) on the **9th of every month**, involving private sector volunteers.
4.  **[[Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana]] (PMMVY):** Provides cash incentives in three installments for the first child to compensate for wage loss and ensure nutrition.

**B. Quality of Care Improvements**
1.  **[[LaQshya]] (Labour Room Quality Improvement Initiative):** Aimed at improving the quality of care in labour rooms and maternity operation theatres to ensure respectful maternal care and reduce preventable deaths.
2.  **[[SUMAN]] (Surakshit Matritva Aashwasan):** Guarantees zero tolerance for denial of services to any woman or newborn visiting a public health facility.
3.  **[[Dakshata]]:** Training programs to improve the competency of providers (Medical Officers, Staff Nurses, ANMs) in essential obstetric care.
4.  **[[Midwifery Initiative]]:** Creating a cadre of Nurse Practitioners in Midwifery (NPMs) to provide compassionate, women-centered care and promote physiological birthing.

**C. Essential and Emergency Obstetric Care**
*   **Early Registration:** Registering pregnancy within 12 weeks and ensuring at least **4 Antenatal Check-ups (ANC)**.
*   **Operationalizing [[First Referral Units]] (FRUs):** Upgrading CHCs/District Hospitals to handle obstetric emergencies (C-sections) and providing **Blood Storage Centers**.
*   **Skilled Birth Attendance:** Promoting deliveries conducted by skilled personnel (Doctors/ANMs/Staff Nurses).

**D. Preventing Indirect Causes**
*   **[[Anemia Mukt Bharat]] (AMB):** Under the 6x6x6 strategy, prophylactic Iron and Folic Acid (IFA) supplementation is provided to women of reproductive age, pregnant, and lactating women.
*   **Deworming:** Administration of Albendazole during pregnancy (after the first trimester).

**E. Other Crucial Strategies**
*   **MTP Services:** Providing safe abortion services under the [[MTP Act]] to prevent mortality from unsafe abortions.
*   **Family Planning:** Promoting spacing methods and Postpartum IUCD (PPIUCD) to reduce the risk associated with high parity and close birth intervals.

**Mnemonic for Strategies: "SAFE J3"**
*   **S**killed Birth Attendance / **S**UMAN
*   **A**nemia Mukt Bharat / **A**ntenatal Care (PMSMA)
*   **F**amily Planning / **F**RUs
*   **E**mergency Obstetric Care
*   **J**anani Suraksha Yojana
*   **J**anani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram
*   **J**eevan Raksha (Referral Transport - 102/108)

### 3. Maternal Death Review (MDR) at Community Level

[[Maternal Death Review]] is a strategy to improve the quality of obstetric care by identifying the causes and contributing factors to maternal deaths.

*   **Definition:** It involves the investigation of maternal deaths in the community to understand the **"why"** and **"how"** of the death, rather than just counting numbers.
*   **Process (Verbal Autopsy):**
    *   **Reporting:** First-line workers like [[ASHA]] or Anganwadi Workers (AWW) report the maternal death to the ANM/Medical Officer immediately.
    *   **Investigation:** A verbal autopsy is conducted by visiting the household of the deceased woman.
    *   **Interviewer:** Usually conducted by the Medical Officer or a trained health worker (ANM/LHV).
    *   **Tool:** A standardized questionnaire is used to interview family members, neighbors, and community members.
*   **Objectives:**
    *   To determine the **medical cause** of death (e.g., Hemorrhage, Sepsis).
    *   To identify **non-medical factors** (Social determinants).
    *   To analyze the **"Three Delays"**:
        1.  Delay in deciding to seek care.
        2.  Delay in reaching the health facility (Transport issues).
        3.  Delay in receiving adequate treatment at the facility.
*   **Outcome:** The findings help in taking corrective actions at the block and district levels to prevent future deaths.
*   **RHIME:** A new method used in SRS called **Representative, Re-sampled, Routine Household Interview of Mortality with Medical Evaluation** is an enhanced form of verbal autopsy used for MMR estimation.

> **Clinical Relevance:**
> Every maternal death is considered a "sentinel event." Community-based MDR helps uncover the social pathologies (like lack of transport, gender bias, financial barriers) that clinical audits might miss. This "social autopsy" is vital for bridging the gap between the community and the health system.
