# [[Communicable Diseases - Respiratory Infections]] > Acute Respiratory Infections Control Program

### Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Control Program

Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI), particularly [[Pneumonia]], remain a leading cause of under-five mortality in India. The ARI Control Program is now integrated into the [[Reproductive and Child Health (RCH)]] Programme and the [[National Health Mission (NHM)]] under the strategy of [[IMNCI]] (Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness).

### 1. Goal and Objectives
*   **Goal:** To reduce the mortality and morbidity due to pneumonia in children under 5 years of age.
*   **Objective:** To reduce the severity of illness and prevent complications through early diagnosis and appropriate case management.

### 2. Epidemiological Determinants
*   **Agent Factors:**
    *   **Bacteria:** *[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]* (Pneumococcus) and *[[Haemophilus influenzae]]* are the most important causes of fatal pneumonia.
    *   **Viruses:** Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Influenza virus, Measles virus.
*   **Host Factors:**
    *   **Age:** Infants and young children are most vulnerable.
    *   **Malnutrition:** Increases the duration and severity of illness. Vitamin A deficiency damages respiratory mucosa.
    *   **Low Birth Weight (LBW):** Increases susceptibility to infection and death.
    *   **Immunization status:** Lack of measles, Hib, or PCV vaccination.
*   **Environmental Factors:**
    *   **Indoor Air Pollution:** Use of biomass fuels (wood, cow dung) in poorly ventilated houses.
    *   **Passive Smoking:** Impairs respiratory function.
    *   **Overcrowding:** Increases transmission.

### 3. Standard Case Management (The Strategy)
The core strategy is to identify and treat pneumonia early before it becomes fatal. Since X-rays and doctors are not available in every village, the program uses **simple clinical signs** (Respiratory Rate and Chest Indrawing) that health workers (ASHA/ANM) can identify.

#### A. Assessment of the Child (2 months - 5 years)
The health worker must look for three key signs:
1.  **Fast Breathing:** Count respiratory rate for **one full minute** when the child is calm.
2.  **Chest Indrawing:** Lower chest wall moves *in* when the child breathes *in*.
3.  **General Danger Signs:** Indicates very severe disease.

**[[Mnemonic: 4 C's of Danger Signs]]**
*   **C**onvulsions (current or history)
*   **C**an't drink/feed (Inability to breastfeed)
*   **C**omatose (Lethargic or unconscious)
*   **C**ontinous Vomiting (Vomits everything)

#### B. Criteria for Fast Breathing (Tachypnea)
| Age Group | Respiratory Rate (Cut-off for Fast Breathing) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **0 – 2 months** | ≥ **60** breaths per minute |
| **2 months – 12 months** | ≥ **50** breaths per minute |
| **12 months – 5 years** | ≥ **40** breaths per minute |

### 4. Classification and Treatment (Revised WHO/IMNCI Guidelines)
The classification has been simplified into two main categories for antibiotic treatment (besides "No Pneumonia").

| Classification | Signs/Symptoms | Color Code | Management |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **No Pneumonia (Cough and Cold)** | • Cough or cold<br>• NO fast breathing<br>• NO chest indrawing<br>• NO danger signs | **GREEN** | **Home Care:**<br>• **Soothe the throat:** Safe home remedies (Ginger, Honey, Tulsi).<br>• **Fluids:** Increase intake.<br>• **Antibiotics:** **NOT** needed.<br>• **Follow up:** If condition worsens. |
| **Pneumonia** | • **Fast breathing**<br>• With or without Chest indrawing (Revised guidelines treat chest indrawing as pneumonia if no danger signs are present)<br>• NO danger signs | **YELLOW** | **Antibiotic Therapy at Home:**<br>• **Drug of Choice:** Oral [[Amoxicillin]].<br>• **Dose:** 40 mg/kg/dose twice daily for 5 days.<br>• **Follow up:** After 48 hours. If no improvement, refer. |
| **Severe Pneumonia** | • **General Danger Signs** (Convulsions, Lethargy, Inability to drink)<br>• **Stridor** in a calm child<br>• Severe malnutrition | **PINK** | **Urgent Referral:**<br>• Give **first dose** of antibiotic (Inj. Ampicillin + Gentamicin or Oral Amoxicillin if injection not possible).<br>• Prevent low blood sugar (give sugar water).<br>• Keep the child warm.<br>• **REFER URGENTLY** to the hospital/FRU. |

*Clinical Relevance:* Previously, **Cotrimoxazole** was the drug of choice. Due to increasing resistance, the guidelines have shifted to **Oral Amoxicillin** as the first line for Pneumonia.

### 5. Management of Young Infants (< 2 months)
Young infants are special because they can deteriorate very fast.
*   **Classification:**
    *   **Severe Pneumonia:** Any sign of pneumonia (Fast breathing >60, severe chest indrawing) or danger signs.
    *   **Action:** **Admit immediately.** Do not treat at home. Parenteral antibiotics (Ampicillin + Gentamicin) are required.

### 6. Prevention Strategies
The program adopts a holistic approach:
1.  **Immunization:**
    *   **[[Measles Vaccine]]:** Measles complications often lead to pneumonia.
    *   **Pentavalent Vaccine:** Protects against *H. influenzae* type b (Hib) and Whooping Cough (Pertussis).
    *   **[[PCV]] (Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine):** Protects against *Strep. pneumoniae*.
2.  **Nutrition:**
    *   **Exclusive Breastfeeding:** For the first 6 months reduces the risk of respiratory infections.
    *   **Vitamin A:** Routine supplementation strengthens mucosal immunity.
3.  **Environmental Control:**
    *   Reduction of indoor smoke (smokeless chulhas).
    *   Avoiding overcrowding.

### 7. New Initiatives
*   **SAANS (Social Awareness and Actions to Neutralize Pneumonia Successfully):** Launched to accelerate action against childhood pneumonia by generating awareness on protection, prevention, and treatment.
*   **Mothers' Empowerment:** Teaching mothers to recognize "Fast Breathing" and "Chest Indrawing" to seek timely care.
