# Vaccine Preventable Diseases: Epidemiology of Poliomyelitis

### [[Vaccine Preventable Diseases]] (VPDs)
VPDs are infectious diseases for which an effective preventive vaccine exists. Under the **Universal Immunization Programme (UIP)** in India, infants are immunized against life-threatening diseases such as **Tuberculosis, Diphtheria, Pertussis, Polio, Tetanus, Hepatitis B, Hib, Measles, and Japanese Encephalitis**. Among these, Poliomyelitis has been a major target for global eradication.

### Epidemiology of [[Orthopaedics/Jignotes/Pediatric Orthopaedics/Poliomyelitis]]

Polio is an acute viral infection involving the alimentary tract, occasionally affecting the CNS leading to flaccid paralysis.

#### 1. Epidemiological Triad

**A. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** [[Poliovirus]] (RNA virus, Picornavirus family).
*   **Serotypes:** Three serotypes exist—Type 1, 2, and 3.
    *   **Type 1:** Most common cause of **epidemics**,.
    *   **Type 2:** Most antigenic; declared eradicated globally in 2015,.
    *   **Type 3:** Most commonly associated with [[Vaccine Associated Paralytic Polio (VAPP)]].
*   **Survival:** Can survive in water for 4 months and feces for 6 months in cold environments.
*   **Reservoir:** **Man is the only reservoir**. There are **NO chronic carriers**,.

**B. Host Factors**
*   **Age:** Primarily a disease of infancy and childhood. In India, 95% of cases occurred in children **< 5 years** (most vulnerable: 6 months to 3 years),.
*   **Sex:** Males are affected more than females (Ratio 3:1).
*   **Immunity:** Maternal antibodies protect infants for the first 3-5 months. Infection with one type does not protect against the others.
*   **Precipitating Factors (Provocative Polio):** Fatigue, trauma, tonsillectomy, and **Intramuscular injections** (e.g., alum-containing DPT) during an epidemic can precipitate paralysis,.

**C. Environmental Factors**
*   **Season:** More common in the **rainy season** (June to September in India),.
*   **Sanitation:** Associated with poor sanitation, contaminated water, and flies.

#### 2. Transmission
*   **Route:** mainly **Faecal-oral route** (dominant in developing countries),.
*   **Droplet infection:** Possible in the acute phase (throat).
*   **Incubation Period:** Usually **7–14 days** (Range: 3–35 days),,.
*   **Communicability:** Greatest **7–10 days before and after** the onset of symptoms,. The virus is excreted in feces for **2–3 weeks** or up to 3–4 months.

#### 3. Clinical Spectrum ([[Iceberg Phenomenon]])
Polio classically demonstrates the iceberg phenomenon where clinical cases are the tip, and subclinical cases are the vast submerged portion.

| Clinical Presentation | Percentage | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inapparent / Subclinical** | **95%** | No symptoms. Vital for spread (reservoir),. |
| **Abortive Polio** | 4–8% | Minor illness (mild fever, sore throat). |
| **Non-Paralytic Polio** | 1% | Aseptic meningitis (stiffness of neck/back). |
| **Paralytic Polio** | < 1% | Asymmetrical flaccid paralysis (LMN type). |

> **Clinical Relevance:** For every **1 clinical case**, there are approximately **1000 subclinical cases** in children,.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw an iceberg. The tip above water represents "Paralytic Polio (<1%)". The submerged part represents "Inapparent/Subclinical infection (95%)" and "Minor illness". The water level represents the line of demarcation between apparent and inapparent infection.

### [[Pulse Polio Programme]] (PPI)

*   **Launched:** In India in **1995-96**,.
*   **Target:** All children **0–5 years** of age, regardless of previous immunization status,.
*   **Concept of "Pulse":** Sudden, simultaneous, mass administration of [[Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV)]] on a single day to the entire target population to flood the community with vaccine virus,.
*   **Objective:** To break the chain of transmission and replace the wild polio virus with the vaccine virus.
*   **Strategy:**
    *   **Fixed Booth approach:** On Day 1 (National Immunization Day - NID).
    *   **House-to-House:** Followed by 2–3 days of house-to-house search ("mop-up") to vaccinate missed children,.
*   **Current Status:** India was removed from the list of endemic countries in 2012 and certified **Polio Free** by WHO on **27th March 2014**,.

> **Mnemonic for Polio Virus Serotypes:**
> *   **1** is the **One** that causes Epidemics.
> *   **2** is **Through** (Eradicated).
> *   **3** is the **Threat** of VAPP (Vaccine Associated Paralytic Polio).

### Prevalence, Incidence, and Eradication

#### 1. Prevalence and Incidence
*   **[[Prevalence]]:** Total number of current cases (old + new) at a given point in time,. In the context of Polio in India today, the prevalence of wild polio infection is **Zero**.
*   **[[Incidence]]:** Number of *new* cases occurring in a defined population during a specific period. Since 2011, the incidence of wild polio in India is **Zero**.
*   **Last Case in India:** Reported from **Howrah, West Bengal** on **13th January 2011** (Wild Poliovirus Type 1),.

#### 2. [[Eradication]]
*   **Definition:** Complete extermination of the infectious agent. It is an "all or none" phenomenon and a global term,.
*   **Why Polio is Eradicable:**
    1.  Man is the only reservoir (no animal host).
    2.  No chronic carrier state.
    3.  Effective vaccines (OPV/IPV) are available.
    4.  Virus does not survive long in the environment.
*   **Polio Endgame Strategy:** Involves the withdrawal of OPV (starting with Type 2 - "The Switch" from Trivalent to Bivalent OPV in April 2016) and introduction of [[Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV)]],.

### Surveillance of Poliomyelitis

Surveillance is the backbone of the eradication initiative. The Gold Standard is **[[AFP Surveillance]]** (Acute Flaccid Paralysis).

#### 1. Case Definition for AFP
Any child **under 15 years** of age with **sudden onset of floppiness/weakness** (flaccid paralysis) OR any person of any age if polio is suspected by a clinician,.

#### 2. Steps of AFP Surveillance
1.  **Notification:** Immediate reporting of any AFP case.
2.  **Investigation:** Within **48 hours** of reporting,.
3.  **Stool Collection (CRITICAL STEP):**
    *   **Two** stool specimens.
    *   Collected **24–48 hours apart**.
    *   Within **14 days** of onset of paralysis.
    *   Quantity: **8 grams** (size of an adult thumb).
    *   Transport: **Reverse Cold Chain** (maintained at 2° to 8°C) to a WHO-accredited lab,,.
4.  **Follow-up:** Check for residual paralysis after **60 days**,.

#### 3. Surveillance Indicators (Targets)
To ensure the system is working effectively:
*   **Non-polio AFP Rate:** Should be **> 2 per 100,000** children <15 years (previously >1),.
*   **Stool Adequacy Rate:** **> 80%** of AFP cases should have 2 adequate stool specimens collected within 14 days,.

#### 4. Environmental Surveillance
Testing sewage samples to detect the presence of poliovirus in the community even in the absence of clinical cases (e.g., Mumbai, Delhi, Patna),.
