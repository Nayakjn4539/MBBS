# [[HEALTH CARE OF THE COMMUNITY]] > Equitable distribution of health services is an important principle of primary health care

### Equitable Distribution in Primary Health Care

**Equitable distribution** is the **first key principle** in the [[Primary Health Care (PHC)]] strategy. It addresses the fundamental imbalance in health care delivery systems where resources are often concentrated in areas of low need, leaving high-need populations underserved.

#### 1. Definition and Concept
*   **Core Principle:** Health services must be shared **equally** by all people irrespective of their **ability to pay**,.
*   **Universal Access:** All individuals, whether **rich or poor**, **urban or rural**, must have access to health services,.
*   **Social Justice:** Inequality in health care access is termed as **social injustice**. [[Equitable distribution]] aims to eradicate this by prioritizing the needs of the vulnerable sections of society.

#### 2. The Current Imbalance (The Problem)
Despite the need, health services in many countries (including India) are predominantly **urban-oriented** and **curative** in nature,.
*   **Concentration:** Health facilities, doctors, and hospitals are mainly concentrated in major towns and cities.
*   **The "Inverse Care" Reality:** The groups most in need of health care (rural populations, urban slum dwellers) often have the least access to it.
*   **Inaccessibility:** The failure to reach the majority of the people is primarily due to **inaccessibility** (physical, economic, or cultural barriers).

> **Clinical Relevance:** In public health practice, addressing equity means a doctor must not only treat the patient in the clinic but advocate for services to reach those who cannot come to the clinic due to poverty or distance.

#### 3. The 3/4th Rule (Statistical Imbalance)
A classic way to describe this disparity is the **"3/4th Paradox"** often cited in community medicine:
*   **Resources vs. Population:** Approximately **three-quarters (75%)** of the health budget/resources are spent in the cities, where only **one-quarter (25%)** of the population lives,.
*   **Rural Neglect:** Conversely, **three-quarters** of the people live in rural areas, yet they receive a minor fraction of the health resources,.

> Draw a weighing scale. On one side, place 'Urban Areas' with a large bag of money/resources but few people. On the other side, place 'Rural Areas' with many people but very few resources. Label it 'The Imbalance in Health Care'.

#### 4. The PHC Solution
Primary Health Care aims to **redress this imbalance** through the following strategies:
*   **Shifting the Center of Gravity:** Moving the focus of the health system from **cities** to **rural areas**,.
*   **Reallocation:** Prioritizing the allocation of health resources to the **[[social periphery]]**—the poorest and most vulnerable populations.
*   **Proximity:** Bringing health services as near to people's homes as possible to overcome geographic barriers.

### Mnemonic for Principles of Primary Health Care
To remember where **Equitable Distribution** fits in, recall the **4 Pillars** of PHC:
**"CARE"**
*   **C** - **C**ommunity Participation
*   **A** - **A**ppropriate Technology
*   **R** - **R**esources (Intersectoral Coordination) - *Note: 'I' is standard, but 'R' for Resources/Relations helps fit the mnemonic, or use **"ICE-A"** below.*
*   **E** - **E**quitable Distribution

*Alternative Standard Mnemonic:* **"ICE-A"**
*   **I** - **I**ntersectoral Coordination
*   **C** - **C**ommunity Participation
*   **E** - **E**quitable Distribution
*   **A** - **A**ppropriate Technology
