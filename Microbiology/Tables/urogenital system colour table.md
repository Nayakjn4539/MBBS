| **Urinary Tract Infections (UTI)** | **Bacteria:** **Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC)** (most common, 70%), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus, Enterococcus, S. saprophyticus. Others: Enterobacter, Serratia, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, M. tuberculosis.  **Fungi:** Candida albicans.  **Parasites:** Schistosoma haematobium, Trichomonas vaginalis.  **Viruses:** BK virus, Adenovirus. | Varies by organism. Most common are Gram-negative bacilli (e.g., E. coli) and Gram-positive cocci (e.g., Enterococcus). | **UPEC serotypes:** O1, O2, O4, O6, O7, and O75 are responsible for most UTIs. | **For UPEC:**  • Adhesins: **P fimbriae**, mannose-resistant fimbriae.  • **Hemolysins**.  • **Capsular K antigen** (for upper UTI).  • **Cytotoxins** (CNF 1, SAT). | **Ascending route (most common):** Colonization of urethra -> Ascension to bladder (cystitis). Facilitated by sexual intercourse, instrumentation. Further ascension can lead to pyelonephritis (kidney infection). **Descending route (hematogenous):** Seeding from bacteremia (e.g., S. aureus, Salmonella). Accounts for 5% of UTIs. | Bacterial toxins may facilitate ascension by inhibiting ureteral peristalsis.  **UPEC cytotoxins:** Cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF 1) and Secreted autotransporter toxin (SAT). | **Lower UTI (Cystitis):** Dysuria (painful urination), frequency, urgency, suprapubic tenderness. Urine may be cloudy with a bad odor.  **Upper UTI (Pyelonephritis):** Fever, flank pain, vomiting, with or without lower tract symptoms. **Asymptomatic Bacteriuria:** Significant bacteria count without symptoms. | **Clean-voided midstream urine** is most common.  **Suprapubic aspiration** is the ideal specimen (for infants, comatose patients). **Catheterized patients:** From catheter tube, not uro-bag. Transport immediately or refrigerate/use boric acid. | **Wet Mount:** To demonstrate pus cells (pyuria > 8 pus cells/mm³ is significant). **Gram Stain:** Not a reliable indicator for routine UTI. Can be useful in pyelonephritis (≥1 bacterium/oil immersion field is significant). | **Culture Media:** Cysteine Lactose Electrolyte Deficient **(CLED) agar** (preferred), MacConkey agar, Blood agar. **Quantitative Culture:** Done using a standardized loop. **Kass concept of significant bacteriuria:** A count of ≥10⁵ CFU/mL is considered significant. | Colony appearance (e.g., Lactose fermenters are pink on MAC, yellow on CLED). Followed by conventional biochemical tests (e.g., ICUT). | **Screening tests:** Leukocyte esterase test (detects pus), Nitrate reduction test (**Griess test**, detects nitrate-reducing bacteria like E. coli). **Automated ID:** MALDI-TOF, VITEK. **Antibody Coated Bacteria Test:** Differentiates upper from lower UTI. | Based on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (AST). **Uncomplicated:** Quinolones, nitrofurantoin, cephalosporins. **Healthcare-associated:** Carbapenems, piperacillin-tazobactam, fosfomycin for MDR organisms. | - |
| **Proteae Infections (UTI)** | Tribe Proteeae: Genera **Proteus**, **Morganella**, **Providencia**.  Common species: \*Proteus mirabilis\*, \*P. vulgaris\*. | Gram-negative, pleomorphic bacilli. Known for characteristic putrid fishy or seminal odor. Exhibit **swarming motility** on solid media. | Antigens H (Hauch, from film of breath) and O (Ohne Hauch, without film) were historically named based on Proteus motility properties. The **Weil-Felix Reaction** uses somatic antigens of non-motile Proteus strains (X-strains: OX2, OX19, OXK) to detect heterophile antibodies for Rickettsial infections. | **Urease enzyme:** This is the key virulence factor. It breaks down urea into ammonia, making the urine alkaline. | Opportunistic pathogens, commonly found in soil, sewage, and as commensals in the intestine. Transmitted endogenously to the urinary tract or colonize wounds. The urease-induced alkaline urine damages renal epithelium and leads to stone formation. | - (Urease is an enzyme, not a classical toxin, but mediates pathology). | Associated with complicated UTIs, wound infections, and septicemia. A key feature is the formation of renal calculi, specifically **struvite stones**, due to alkaline urine. | Urine, wound swabs, blood for culture. | Gram-negative pleomorphic coccobacilli, can appear bacillary or filamentous. | Shows characteristic **swarming growth** on non-selective media like Blood Agar. Non-lactose fermenter on MacConkey agar. Motile. | All members are positive for Phenylalanine Deaminase (PPA) test. Differentiated by biochemicals: Indole (+ for \*P. vulgaris\*, - for \*P. mirabilis\*), Urease (+), TSI shows alkaline/acid with H₂S production. | Conventional biochemical tests. Automated systems like MALDI-TOF or VITEK. | Often multidrug-resistant (MDR). Drug of choice depends on AST. Effective drugs include aminoglycosides, fourth-generation cephalosporins (cefepime), and carbapenems. | - |
| **Urinary Schistosomiasis (Bilharziasis)** | \*Schistosoma haematobium\* (a blood fluke/trematode). | **Egg:** Elliptical shape, non-operculated, with a characteristic **sharp terminal spine**. Measures 112–170 µm × 40–70 µm. | - | Soluble antigens released from eggs provoke a host immune response. | **Transmission:** Acquired by skin penetration of infective **cercaria larvae** from contaminated freshwater containing intermediate host snails.  **Pathogenesis:** Adult worms reside in vesical and ureteric venous plexuses. Pathology is not caused by worms but by host's **delayed type hypersensitivity reaction** to eggs deposited in tissues, leading to **egg granuloma** formation and fibrosis. | **Soluble egg antigens** provoke the granulomatous host response. | **Acute:** Dermatitis at cercarial penetration site.  **Chronic:** Characterized by dysuria and terminal hematuria. Can lead to obstructive uropathy (hydronephrosis) and is a major risk factor for **bladder carcinoma (squamous cell type)**. | Urine, especially the terminal portion, collected between 12 noon and 3 PM. Bladder mucosal biopsy. | Urine microscopy after centrifugation or membrane filtration to demonstrate the characteristic terminal-spined eggs. | - (Parasite, not cultured). | Identification of eggs is diagnostic. | **Antigen Detection:** Detection of Circulating Cathodic Antigen (CCA) or Circulating Anodic Antigen (CAA) in serum/urine by ELISA or dipstick assays indicates recent infection.  **Antibody Detection:** HAMA-FAST-ELISA, HAMA-EITB for sero-epidemiology. | Praziquantel is the drug of choice. Alternative is Metrifonate. | - |
| **Syphilis** | \*Treponema pallidum\*. | A thin, flexible, spirally coiled spirochete with 6-20 spirals and tapering ends. Displays a characteristic slow rotation around its longitudinal axis (**corkscrew motility**). Cannot be seen by light microscopy. | - | - (Pathology is primarily immune-mediated). | **Transmission:** Primarily sexual contact. Also by direct contact, blood transfusion, or transplacental (congenital syphilis).  **Pathogenesis:** Spirochetes rapidly penetrate minute abrasions on skin/mucosa, enter lymphatics and blood, leading to systemic infection long before any lesion appears. Incubation period is 10-90 days. | - (Note: **Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction** is a reaction to lipoproteins released by the death of treponemes during antibiotic treatment). | Known as "The Great Pretender".  **Primary:** A single, painless, indurated ulcer called a **hard chancre**, with painless, firm, bilateral regional lymphadenopathy. **Secondary:** Skin rashes (palms and soles), mucous patches, and **Condylomata lata**. **Tertiary:** Destructive granulomatous lesions (**Gumma**), cardiovascular syphilis (aortic aneurysm), and **neurosyphilis**. | Exudate from primary or secondary lesions for microscopy. Blood for serology. CSF for neurosyphilis. | **Dark Ground Microscopy (DGM):** Visualizes live, motile spirochetes from fresh lesion exudate.  **Silver Impregnation Stains:** Fontana stain (smears), Levaditi stain (tissue) to make spirochetes visible.  **Direct Fluorescent Antibody (DFA-TP):** Stains treponemes apple-green. | Cannot be grown in artificial culture media. Can be maintained in susceptible animals like rabbit testes (**Nichols strain**). | Serology is paramount. Differentiated from other genital spirochetes by characteristic motility, size, and spiral character. | **Serology:** • **Non-treponemal tests** (screening, monitoring): VDRL, RPR. Detect reagin antibody.  • **Treponemal tests** (confirmatory): FTA-ABS, TPHA, TPPA. Detect specific treponemal antibodies. **PCR:** Important for diagnosing congenital and neurosyphilis. | Penicillin G is the drug of choice for all stages. Dosage and duration vary by stage. Tetracycline is an alternative for penicillin-allergic patients (except in pregnancy/neurosyphilis). | - |
| **Chancroid (Soft Chancre)** | \*Haemophilus ducreyi\*. | Pleomorphic gram-negative coccobacillus. On Gram stain, they appear in groups or parallel chains, described as a **"school of fish"** or **"rail road track"** appearance. Often shows bipolar staining. | Antigenically homogeneous. | - | Sexually transmitted infection (STI), predominantly via heterosexual contact. Incubation period is 4-7 days. Chancroid ulcers increase the efficiency of HIV transmission. | - | Characterized by a painful, soft genital ulceration that bleeds easily. Associated with enlarged, tender, unilateral, and suppurative inguinal lymph nodes (**bubo**). | Exudate or swab from the edge of the ulcer. Aspirate from an inguinal bubo. | Gram stain of exudate showing the characteristic "school of fish" arrangement of gram-negative coccobacilli. | Difficult to culture. Requires Factor X (hemin), but not V. Grows on enriched chocolate agar or rabbit blood agar with 1% isovitalex and vancomycin. Requires high humidity and 10% CO2. | Biochemically inert. Growth surrounding an X-factor disk is presumptive. Confirmation by slide agglutination test with specific antiserum. | **Multiplex PCR** assay targeting 16S rRNA is a modern diagnostic method for simultaneous detection of multiple STI pathogens. | Azithromycin (1g oral, single dose) is the drug of choice. Alternatives include ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, or erythromycin. Treatment of sexual partners is essential. | - |
| **Herpes Genitalis** | Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), type 1 and type 2. (Recurrence is more common with HSV-2). | Enveloped dsDNA virus. Causes characteristic cytopathic effects in cells (multinucleated giant cells). | - | Ability to establish **latency** in sacral nerve ganglia, leading to reactivation and recurrent episodes. | Transmitted by direct contact with lesions during sexual activity. Virus infects epithelial cells, then travels via neurons to establish latency in sensory nerve ganglia. Reactivation leads to viral travel back down the nerve to the skin/mucosa. | - | Characterized by multiple, painful, bilateral, tiny vesicular ulcers. Associated with tender, firm, often bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. Primary infection may include fever, headache, and malaise. Recurrent episodes are typically milder and shorter. | Scrapings from the base of a fresh vesicle. | **Tzanck preparation** (Giemsa stain) or Papanicolaou's stain of lesion scrapings reveals multinucleated **giant cells** and intranuclear inclusion bodies. | Virus can be isolated by culture in susceptible cell lines from lesion scrapings. | - | **Viral antigen detection** by direct immunofluorescence (IF).  **Viral DNA detection** by PCR from scrapings is highly sensitive and specific. Often included in multiplex STI PCR panels. | Antiviral drugs: Acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir. First episode is treated for 7-14 days. Recurrent episodes can be managed with short-course (1-3 day) regimens. | - |
| **Lymphogranuloma Venereum (LGV)** | \*Chlamydia trachomatis\*, biovar LGV, serovars L1, L2, L3. | Obligate intracellular bacterium with two morphological forms: Elementary Body (EB, infective) and Reticulate Body (RB, replicative). Forms intracytoplasmic inclusions (**Miyagawa corpuscle**). | **Biovar:** LGV **Serovars:** L1, L2, L3. Typed by microimmunofluorescence. | - (Invasiveness of these serovars compared to others). | An invasive, systemic sexually transmitted infection. The organism infects mucosal surfaces, then spreads via lymphatics to regional lymph nodes, causing intense inflammation. | - | Progresses in three stages: **1st Stage:** A small, painless, transient ulcer. **2nd Stage:** Painful, tender, soft inguinal lymph node enlargement (**bubo**). May form fistulae. A unilateral **'groove sign'** may be present. **3rd Stage:** (in untreated cases) Chronic inflammation leads to rectal strictures, rectovaginal fistulae, and genital elephantiasis (**esthiomene**). | Aspirate from a bubo. Swab from ulcer or rectum. | Direct immunofluorescence (IF) to detect inclusion bodies. | Can be cultured in cell lines like McCoy or HeLa, but this is rarely done now. | Serology via Microimmunofluorescence (MIF) test can detect specific antibodies. The **Frei test** (a skin test) is obsolete. | **Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT)** for \*C. trachomatis\* DNA is the diagnostic test of choice. Antibody detection by ELISA or MIF is also used. | Requires a longer treatment course. Doxycycline for 21 days is the drug of choice. An alternative is Azithromycin weekly for 3 weeks. | - |
| **Donovanosis (Granuloma Inguinale)** | \*Klebsiella granulomatis\* (formerly \*Calymmatobacterium granulomatis\*). | Gram-negative, non-motile, capsulated bacillus. Microscopically seen as **Donovan bodies**: large cyst-like macrophages filled with deeply stained bacilli showing a bipolar, **"safety-pin"** appearance. | - | Capsule. | Sexually transmitted disease with a chronic course. Risk factors include poor hygiene and multiple sex partners. Incubation period is 1-4 weeks but can be up to 6 months. | - | Lesion begins as a painless papule that evolves into a characteristic painless, progressive, ulcerative lesion described as **"beefy-red"** that bleeds readily on contact. True lymph node involvement is rare, but subcutaneous granulomas (**pseudobuboes**) can occur. | A swab rolled firmly over the ulcer or a piece of crushed granulation tissue spread between two slides. | Direct microscopy of a Giemsa or Wright's stained smear is diagnostic, showing the pathognomonic **Donovan bodies** within macrophages. | Can be grown on egg yolk medium or in HEp-2 cell lines, but this is not done for routine diagnosis. Non-motile. | Identification is based on the characteristic microscopic finding of Donovan bodies. | Diagnosis is primarily clinical and confirmed by microscopy. A PCR targeting the \*phoE\* gene can differentiate it from other \*Klebsiella\* species. | Azithromycin, given for at least 3 weeks until all lesions have healed. Alternatives include doxycycline or co-trimoxazole. | - |
| **Gonococcal Urethritis (Gonorrhea)** | \*Neisseria gonorrhoeae\*. | Non-capsulated, Gram-negative, kidney-shaped diplococcus. Typically found intracellularly within neutrophils on Gram stain. | Serotyping based on outer membrane proteins, e.g., PorB.1A and PorB.1B serotypes. | • **Pili (fimbriae)** for adhesion. • **Outer membrane proteins:** Porin (Protein I), Opacity-associated protein (Opa, Protein II). • **IgA1 protease**. • **Lipo-oligosaccharide (LOS)**. | An exclusively human disease transmitted by sexual contact. Organism adheres to mucosal epithelial cells (urethra, cervix, pharynx) via pili and Opa proteins, leading to inflammation and purulent discharge. Enhances HIV transmission. | **Lipo-oligosaccharide (LOS)** has endotoxin activity, which mediates local inflammation and damage. | **Males:** Acute urethritis with purulent urethral discharge (2-7 day incubation). Complications include epididymitis and prostatitis.  **Females:** Often asymptomatic. Most common presentation is mucopurulent cervicitis. Can ascend to cause Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) and **Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome** (perihepatitis). **Neonates:** Ophthalmia neonatorum. **Systemic:** Disseminated Gonococcal Infection (DGI) presenting as polyarthritis and dermatitis. | Urethral swab in men; endocervical swab in women. Dacron or rayon swabs are preferred. Transport in Stuart's or Amies medium if delay is expected. | Gram stain of urethral exudate showing intracellular Gram-negative diplococci is highly sensitive and specific in symptomatic men, but only 50% sensitive in women. | Culture requires enriched, selective media like **Thayer Martin medium** (chocolate agar with antibiotics) or modified Thayer-Martin. Requires a CO₂-enriched atmosphere. Non-motile. | Catalase and oxidase positive. Ferments glucose only (differentiates it from other \*Neisseria\* species). | **Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs)** are the current standard for diagnosis from clinical specimens. Automated systems like MALDI-TOF can be used for identification from culture. | Third-generation cephalosporins, e.g., a single IM dose of Ceftriaxone. Often co-treated for Chlamydia with azithromycin or doxycycline. | - |
| **Chlamydia Trachomatis (Urogenital Infections)** | \*Chlamydia trachomatis\*, biovar TRIC, serovars D-K. | Obligate intracellular bacterium. Exists as extracellular, infective Elementary Body (EB) and intracellular, replicative Reticulate Body (RB). Forms a compact, glycogen-containing intracytoplasmic inclusion body (**Halberstaedter-Prowazek body**). | **Biovar:** TRIC (Trachoma-inclusion conjunctivitis).  **Serovars:** D-K. Typing is done by microimmunofluorescence (MIF) targeting the MOMP antigen. | • **Major Outer Membrane Protein (MOMP)**. • Genus-specific Lipopolysaccharide (LPS). • Ability to induce a persistent infection. | Transmitted sexually. EB is the infective form that attaches to and enters columnar epithelial cells. Inside, it transforms to RB, replicates, and forms an inclusion. Cell lysis releases new EBs. A trigger can initiate a hyperreactive immune response. | LPS antigen induces TNF-α and other cytokines, contributing to inflammation, scarring, and fibrosis. | **Males:** Most common cause of Non-Gonococcal Urethritis (NGU), with mucopurulent discharge and dysuria. Can cause epididymitis and proctitis.  **Females:** Mucopurulent cervicitis, can progress to PID, endometritis, and perihepatitis (**Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome**). **Both:** **Reactive Arthritis (Reiter's syndrome)**: conjunctivitis, urethritis, arthritis. | Specimen must contain cells. Urethral or endocervical swabs. First-catch morning urine is also a good specimen for NAAT. | Gram stain often reveals sterile pyuria (neutrophils without visible organisms). Inclusion bodies can be stained with Giemsa, Castaneda, or **Lugol's iodine** (stains glycogen matrix brown). Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) can also be used. | Cell line culture was the old gold standard. Requires inoculation into susceptible cell lines like **McCoy** or **HeLa** cells and incubation for 48-72 hours. | Serotyping by MIF test. Identification from culture by staining inclusions. | **Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs)** like PCR are the most sensitive, specific, and recommended method of choice. Enzyme Immunoassays (EIA) for LPS antigen are less sensitive. | Azithromycin (single dose) or Doxycycline (for 7 days) for uncomplicated infections. Longer courses are needed for complicated infections like PID. | - |
| **Trichomoniasis (Trichomonal Vaginitis)** | \*Trichomonas vaginalis\* (a flagellated protozoan parasite). | Pear-shaped trophozoite (7-23 µm). No cyst stage. Has a single nucleus, an undulating membrane supported by a **costa**, and five flagella. Exhibits a characteristic jerky or twitching motility. | - | Adhesin proteins for attachment to vaginal epithelium. | Sexually transmitted infection. Humans are the only host; asymptomatic females are the main reservoir. The flagellated trophozoite is the infective stage, multiplying by binary fission in the urogenital tract. | - | **Females:** Vulvovaginitis with a thin, profuse, foul-smelling, purulent, and often frothy, yellowish-green vaginal discharge. Vaginal pH is elevated (>4.5). A characteristic "strawberry appearance" of the cervix (**Colpitis macularis**) is seen in 2% of cases.  **Males:** Often asymptomatic, but can cause nongonococcal urethritis. | Fresh vaginal or urethral discharge, urine sediment. Sample must be examined within 10-20 minutes of collection for motility. | **Wet (saline) mount** is the primary method to demonstrate the characteristic jerky, motile trophozoites and pus cells. Sensitivity is 40-80%. Permanent stains like Giemsa or Papanicolaou can be used but do not show motility. | Culture is the gold standard for diagnosis (75-96% sensitive). Media used include Lash's cysteine hydrolysate serum media. Specialized containers like "**InPouch TV**" are available. | Identification is based on observing the characteristic morphology and jerky motility in a wet mount. | **Antigen detection** in vaginal secretions by rapid ICT or ELISA.  **Molecular methods (PCR)** targeting the beta-tubulin gene are highly sensitive.  **Supportive tests:** Raised vaginal pH > 4.5, positive **Whiff test** (fishy odor with 10% KOH). | Metronidazole or tinidazole is the drug of choice, usually as a single 2g oral dose. It is crucial to treat both sexual partners simultaneously to prevent reinfection. | - |
