# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > Mention the objectives of RNTCP. Discuss the new protocol for diagnosing a case of pulmonary tuberculosis & steps of management.

### Objectives of [[Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP)]]

The RNTCP, now renamed as the **[[National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP)]]**, operates with the following core objectives:

1.  **Cure Rate:** To achieve a cure rate of at least **85%** of infectious cases of tuberculosis (new sputum smear-positive) through short-course chemotherapy involving peripheral health functionaries,.
2.  **Case Detection:** To achieve a case detection rate of at least **70%** of estimated cases,.
3.  **Elimination Goal:** The vision has evolved to a "TB-free India" with zero deaths, disease, and poverty due to TB, aiming for elimination by **2025** (five years ahead of the global SDG target of 2030),.

### New Protocol for Diagnosing Pulmonary Tuberculosis

The diagnostic strategy has shifted from simple smear microscopy to **Universal Drug Susceptibility Testing (UDST)** using rapid molecular diagnostics.

#### 1. Identification of [[Presumptive TB Case]]
A person is suspected of having pulmonary TB if they present with:
*   **Cough for ≥ 2 weeks**,.
*   Fever for > 2 weeks.
*   Significant weight loss.
*   Haemoptysis (blood in sputum).
*   *Note:* In **[[PLHIV]]** (People Living with HIV), a cough of *any duration* is significant.

#### 2. Diagnostic Tools
*   **Sputum Smear Microscopy:** Examination of **two** sputum specimens (Spot-Spot or Spot-Morning) using [[Ziehl-Neelsen staining]] or Fluorescence Microscopy,.
*   **Rapid Molecular Diagnostic Tests:** **[[CBNAAT]]** (Cartridge Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test / GeneXpert) or **[[TruNAAT]]**. These detect *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* and **Rifampicin resistance** simultaneously,.
*   **Chest X-ray (CXR):** Used as a screening tool to increase sensitivity.

#### 3. Diagnostic Algorithm (Simplified)
> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Flowchart showing the algorithm from Presumptive TB -> Sputum/CXR -> CBNAAT -> Treatment

*   **Step 1:** Perform Sputum Smear Microscopy / Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT).
*   **Step 2:**
    *   **If Smear Positive:** Proceed to **[[CBNAAT]]** / Line Probe Assay (LPA) to check for drug resistance (Universal DST),.
    *   **If Smear Negative but Chest X-Ray Suggestive:** Perform **[[CBNAAT]]** immediately.
*   **Step 3 (Interpretation):**
    *   *MTB Detected, Rifampicin Sensitive:* Treat as Drug-Sensitive TB (DSTB).
    *   *MTB Detected, Rifampicin Resistant:* Manage as [[MDR-TB]] (Multi-Drug Resistant TB),.

> **Clinical Relevance:** **[[CBNAAT]]** is the **preferred first-line diagnostic test** for high-risk groups like **[[PLHIV]]**, pediatric cases, and extra-pulmonary TB suspects because of its high sensitivity and ability to detect drug resistance upfront,.

### Steps of Management

The management relies on the **[[DOTS]]** (Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course) strategy, ensuring adherence and completion of therapy.

#### 1. Categorization and Treatment Regimen
The treatment has transitioned from intermittent (thrice-weekly) to a **Daily Regimen** using **Fixed Dose Combinations (FDCs)**,.

**Standard Regimen for Drug-Sensitive TB (Adults)**

| Phase | Duration | Drugs | Frequency |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Intensive Phase (IP)** | 2 Months | **H R Z E** | Daily |
| **Continuation Phase (CP)** | 4 Months | **H R E** | Daily |

*Source:,*

*   **H:** Isoniazid
*   **R:** Rifampicin
*   **Z:** Pyrazinamide
*   **E:** Ethambutol

*   *Note:* Previously treated patients (Recurrent/Relapse) are now also initiated on this standard regimen (2HRZE/4HRE) unless drug resistance is detected.

#### 2. Management of Drug-Resistant TB ([[MDR-TB]])
If Rifampicin resistance is detected, patients are started on specific DR-TB regimens containing newer drugs like **[[Bedaquiline]]** and **Delamanid**.
*   **Shorter Oral Regimen:** 9-11 months duration,.
*   **Longer Oral Regimen:** 18-20 months for difficult cases,.

#### 3. Monitoring and Follow-up
*   **Sputum Smear Examination:** Done at the end of the Intensive Phase (IP) and Continuation Phase (CP) to confirm conversion and cure.
*   **Technology:** Use of **[[NIKSHAY]]** portal for web-based notification and patient tracking.
*   **Social Support:** **Nikshay Poshan Yojana** provides financial incentives (₹500/month) to patients for nutritional support,.

#### 4. Chemoprophylaxis (Preventive Therapy)
*   **Target:** Children < 6 years who are household contacts of sputum-positive cases and all HIV-positive patients,.
*   **Drug:** **[[Isoniazid]]** Preventive Therapy (IPT),.

### Mnemonic for First-Line Drugs
**"RIPE"**
*   **R** - Rifampicin (Bactericidal)
*   **I** - Isoniazid (Bactericidal, cheapest, safest)
*   **P** - Pyrazinamide (Best for intracellular bacilli/acidic pH)
*   **E** - Ethambutol (Bacteriostatic, prevents resistance)
