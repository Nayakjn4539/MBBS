# Macular Hole

### Definition
A **Macular Hole** is a partial-thickness or full-thickness defect in the [[neurosensory retina]] involving the foveal region.

### Etiology and Risk Factors
*   **Idiopathic/Senile (Most Common):** Accounts for 83% of cases. Typically affects females (F:M = 3:1) in the 6th–8th decade of life.
*   **Trauma:** Blunt ocular trauma causing [[Commotio Retinae]] (Berlin's edema) can progress to a macular hole (5% of cases).
*   **High Myopia:** Associated with [[pathological myopia]] and posterior staphyloma,.
*   **Cystoid Macular Edema (CME):** Chronic CME can lead to the rupture of cystoid spaces causing a hole,.
*   **Vitreomacular Traction:** Persistent traction on the fovea.
*   **Others:** Solar retinopathy, post-surgical, post-laser treatment, inflammation.

### Pathogenesis
Idiopathic macular holes are primarily caused by tangential tractional forces exerted by the [[cortical vitreous]] on the foveal surface, often associated with an early or evolving [[Posterior Vitreous Detachment]] (PVD).

### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Decreased Visual Acuity:** Typically ranges around 6/60 for full-thickness holes.
    *   **Metamorphopsia:** Distortion of vision (straight lines appear wavy).
    *   **Central Scotoma:** A blind spot in the central field of vision.

*   **Signs:**
    *   **Watzke-Allen Test:** A thin slit beam projected over the macula appears "broken" or "thinned" to the patient.
    *   **Amsler Grid:** Demonstrates central distortion or scotoma.
    *   **Fundoscopy:** Round, reddish spot at the fovea punched-out appearance. In Stage 3/4, a grey halo (cuff of [[subretinal fluid]]) surrounds the hole. Yellowish deposits may be seen at the base.

### Gass Classification of Idiopathic Macular Holes
This staging system is based on biomicroscopic findings and [[Optical Coherence Tomography]] (OCT).

| Stage | Name | Clinical Description | OCT Findings |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stage 1a** | Impending Hole | Absent foveal reflex; yellow spot at fovea. | Pseudocyst with vitreous detachment. |
| **Stage 1b** | Occult Hole | Yellow ring at the fovea. | Progression of pseudocyst with a break in outer foveal layer. |
| **Stage 2** | Small Full-Thickness Hole | Full-thickness defect **< 400 µm**. Can be central or eccentric. | Full-thickness break < 400 µm. |
| **Stage 3** | Full-Thickness Hole | Hole size **> 400 µm** with a cuff of subretinal fluid. **No PVD** (No Weiss ring). | Full-thickness hole > 400 µm with partial vitreomacular adhesion. |
| **Stage 4** | Full-Thickness Hole + PVD | Full-thickness hole with complete **[[Posterior Vitreous Detachment]]** (Weiss ring visible). | Large hole with posterior vitreous detached from disc and macula. |

### Investigations
1.  **Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT):** 
    *   **Gold Standard** for diagnosis and staging.
    *   Differentiates full-thickness holes from lamellar holes, pseudoholes, and cysts.
    *   Evaluates vitreomacular traction.
2.  **Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA):**
    *   Shows early foveal **hyperfluorescence** (window defect) due to loss of xanthophyll pigment/RPE exposure.
    *   **No leakage** is seen in late phases (differentiates from [[Cystoid Macular Edema]]).

### Treatment
**1. Observation:** 
*   Recommended for **Stage 1** (Impending hole) as spontaneous closure may occur. However, close follow-up is needed as 50% progress.

**2. Surgical Management (Pars Plana Vitrectomy):**
*   **Indication:** Stage 2–4 holes of recent onset (<1 year) with VA < 6/24.
*   **Procedure Steps:**
    *   **[[Pars Plana Vitrectomy]] (PPV):** Removal of vitreous gel.
    *   **Posterior Hyaloid Removal:** Relieves traction.
    *   **ILM Peeling:** Peeling of the [[Internal Limiting Membrane]] reduces tangential traction and improves closure rates.
    *   **Gas Tamponade:** Fluid-air exchange followed by injection of non-expansile gas (SF6 or C3F8).
    *   **Post-op Positioning:** Strict **prone positioning** (face down) for 1–2 weeks to keep the gas bubble against the macula.
*   **Success Rate:** Anatomical closure in 80–90% of cases.

**3. Pharmacolysis:**
*   **Ocrioplasmin (Microplasmin):** Intravitreal injection for enzymatic vitreolysis to induce PVD and close small holes (chemical relief of traction).

**4. Complications of Surgery:**
*   Progression of **[[Cataract]]** (most common).
*   Retinal detachment, phototoxicity, endophthalmitis.

# Epiretinal Membrane (ERM)

### Terminology
Also known as **Macular Pucker**, **Cellophane Maculopathy**, **Preretinal Macular Fibrosis**, or **Surface Wrinkling Retinopathy**,.

### Etiology
*   **Idiopathic (Senile):** Most common. Associated with aging and [[Posterior Vitreous Detachment]] (PVD).
*   **Secondary Causes:**
    *   Retinal vascular diseases (e.g., [[Diabetic Retinopathy]], [[Retinal Vein Occlusion]]).
    *   Post-surgical (Retinal detachment surgery, cryotherapy, photocoagulation).
    *   Intraocular inflammation ([[Uveitis]]).
    *   Trauma.

### Pathogenesis
*   Proliferation of glial cells (astrocytes, hyalocytes) or retinal pigment epithelial cells on the inner surface of the retina (on the Internal Limiting Membrane),.
*   Contraction of this membrane leads to wrinkling (puckering) of the underlying macula.

### Clinical Features
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Metamorphopsia** (distortion of shapes/lines) is the hallmark.
    *   Mild to moderate decrease in visual acuity.
    *   Monocular diplopia (rare).
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Cellophane Maculopathy:** Thin membrane appearing as a glinting, shifting light reflex (sheen) over the macula.
    *   **Macular Pucker:** Thick, contracted membrane causing retinal striae (wrinkling) and vascular tortuosity.
    *   **Pseudohole:** The membrane may have an opening that mimics a macular hole, but without loss of retinal tissue.

### Management
1.  **Observation:** For mild cases with minimal symptoms or good visual acuity.
2.  **Surgical Treatment:**
    *   **[[Pars Plana Vitrectomy]] (PPV) with Membrane Peeling:**
    *   Indicated when central vision is threatened or significantly impaired causing visual handicap (metamorphopsia).
    *   The epiretinal membrane is carefully dissected and peeled off the retinal surface using micro-forceps.
