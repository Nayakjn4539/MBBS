# [[Preventive Medicine In Obstetrics, Paediatrics And Geriatrics]] > Adverse Events Following Immunization

### Definition
An [[Adverse Event Following Immunization]] (AEFI) is any untoward medical occurrence which follows immunization and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine. The adverse event may be any unfavourable or unintended sign, abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease.

### Classification of AEFI (WHO/CIOMS 2012)
The World Health Organization and Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) categorize AEFI into five specific types:

1.  **[[Vaccine Product-related Reaction]]:** Caused or precipitated by a vaccine due to one or more of the inherent properties of the vaccine product.
    *   *Example:* Extensive limb swelling following [[DPT vaccination]].
2.  **[[Vaccine Quality Defect-related Reaction]]:** Caused by a defect in the vaccine product (or its administration device) occurring during the manufacturing process.
    *   *Example:* Failure to completely inactivate a lot of IPV leading to paralytic polio.
3.  **[[Immunization Error-related Reaction]]:** Caused by inappropriate vaccine handling, prescribing, or administration. **These are preventable.**
    *   *Example:* Transmission of infection by a contaminated multidose vial; sterile abscess due to freezing of Pentavalent vaccine.
4.  **[[Immunization Anxiety-related Reaction]]:** Arising from anxiety about the immunization.
    *   *Example:* Vasovagal syncope (fainting) in an adolescent during/following vaccination.
5.  **[[Coincidental Event]]:** Caused by something other than the vaccine product, error, or anxiety.
    *   *Example:* A fever occurs at the time of vaccination (temporal association) but is actually caused by malaria.

> *   **C**oincidental

### Types of Reactions Based on Severity

#### 1. Minor Vaccine Reactions
Usually occur within a few hours of injection, resolve after a short period, and pose little danger.
*   **Local:** Pain, swelling, or redness at the site of injection. (Common with DPT, TT).
*   **Systemic:** Fever, muscle pain, malaise, headache.
*   **Specific:**
    *   **Measles/MMR:** Rash, conjunctivitis (5-15% cases).
    *   **Mumps:** Parotid swelling.
    *   **Rubella:** Joint pains.

#### 2. Serious and Severe Vaccine Reactions
These result in death, hospitalization, disability, or require intervention to prevent permanent impairment.

| Vaccine | Rare/Serious Reaction | Clinical Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[BCG]]** | Suppurative lymphadenitis, Osteitis, Disseminated BCG infection | Often due to wrong technique or immunodeficiency. |
| **[[OPV]]** | [[Vaccine Associated Paralytic Poliomyelitis]] (VAPP) | Risk is higher with the first dose. |
| **Measles** | Thrombocytopenia, Anaphylaxis, Toxic Shock Syndrome | TSS occurs if used >4 hours after reconstitution. |
| **DPT/Pertussis** | Persistent inconsolable screaming (>3 hrs), HHE (Hypotonic Hyporesponsive Episode), Seizures | Attributed to the whole-cell pertussis component. |
| **Hepatitis B** | Anaphylaxis | Very rare (1.1 per million doses). |
| **Influenza (Killed)** | Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) | Rare neurological association. |
| **Yellow Fever** | Viscerotropic/Neurotropic disease | Rare; mimics wild yellow fever. |

### Immunization Errors (Programmatic Errors)
These are the most common cause of AEFI clusters and are entirely preventable.

| Error | Consequence |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Non-sterile injection** | Infection, abscess, sepsis, Toxic Shock Syndrome, transmission of Blood Borne Viruses (Hep B, HIV). |
| **Reconstitution error** | Using wrong diluent (e.g., muscle relaxant instead of saline) can cause death; Drug toxicity. |
| **Injection at incorrect site** | Sciatic nerve damage (gluteal injection); Local reaction. |
| **Vaccine transported/stored incorrectly** | **Freezing** of DPT/TT/HepB causes sterile abscesses and lack of potency. **Heat exposure** leads to vaccine failure. |
| **Ignoring contraindications** | Anaphylaxis (if previous history ignored). |

### Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS)
*   **Cause:** Growth of *Staphylococcus aureus* in a reconstituted vaccine vial (usually [[Measles]] or [[BCG]]).
*   **Risk Factor:** Using a reconstituted vial beyond **4 hours** or keeping it at high ambient temperatures.
*   **Symptoms:** Abrupt onset of high fever, vomiting, and watery diarrhea within a few hours of vaccination. Can lead to death within 48 hours.
*   **Prevention:** **[[Open Vial Policy]]** does NOT apply to reconstituted vaccines. Discard them after 4 hours!

### Investigation of AEFI
The goal is to determine if the event is vaccine-related, a program error, or coincidental.

**Steps in Investigation:**
1.  **Confirm:** Verify the diagnosis and check the details of the report.
2.  **Investigate and Collect Data:**
    *   **Patient:** History, previous allergies, family history.
    *   **Event:** Clinical description, timing, treatment.
    *   **Vaccine:** Lot number, expiry, [[VVM]] status, storage conditions (cold chain).
    *   **Others:** Did others receiving the same lot get sick? (Cluster investigation).
3.  **Assess the Service:** Check storage (ILR), diluents, needle/syringe disposal, reconstitution practices.
4.  **Formulate Hypothesis:** Likely cause (e.g., cluster of abscesses suggests unsterile technique).
5.  **Test Hypothesis:** Laboratory testing of the vaccine vial (if available) or biological samples.
6.  **Conclude:** Classify the cause and take corrective action.

### Management of AEFI
*   **Mild reactions:** Symptomatic treatment (Paracetamol for fever, cold compress for swelling).
*   **Anaphylaxis (Medical Emergency):**
    *   **Recognition:** Sudden hypotension, bronchospasm, urticaria, angioedema within minutes.
    *   **Treatment:** **[[Adrenaline]] (Epinephrine) 1:1000** solution.
    *   **Dose:** 0.01 ml/kg (Max 0.5 ml) **Intramuscular (IM)**. Repeat every 10-20 mins if needed.
    *   **Supportive:** Oxygen, IV fluids, Antihistamines, Hydrocortisone (to prevent late reaction).
*   **Communication:** Reassure parents, explain the cause (if known), and maintain confidence in the immunization program.

### Clinical Relevance & Exam Tips
*   **Fainting vs. Anaphylaxis:** Fainting (vasovagal) is common in adolescents, characterized by pallor, bradycardia, and rapid recovery with elevation of legs. Anaphylaxis involves skin rash (urticaria), respiratory distress, and tachycardia.
*   **Cluster of Cases:** If multiple children from the same session develop similar symptoms (e.g., abscess), it is almost always a **Programmatic Error** (unsterile technique or wrong diluent).
*   **Reporting:** Serious AEFIs (Death, Hospitalization, Cluster, Disability) must be reported immediately to the District Immunization Officer (DIO).
