# Mastoidectomy

**Mastoidectomy** is a surgical procedure performed to remove the [[mastoid air cells]], often to treat infection, remove cholesteatoma, or gain access to the middle and inner ear structures. The procedure involves drilling the mastoid bone to create a cavity.

## Surgical Anatomy and Landmarks

Success in mastoid surgery depends on the precise identification of anatomical landmarks to avoid injury to vital structures like the [[facial nerve]], [[sigmoid sinus]], and [[dura mater]].

### Surface Landmarks
*   **[[Macewen’s Triangle]] (Suprameatal Triangle):** The surgical landmark for the [[mastoid antrum]].
    *   **Superiorly:** [[Temporal line]] (Supramastoid crest).
    *   **Anteriorly:** Posterosuperior margin of the bony [[external auditory canal]].
    *   **Posteriorly:** A tangent line drawn to the posterior meatal wall.
    *   *Note:* The antrum lies approximately 1.5 cm deep to this triangle in adults.
*   **[[Spine of Henle]]:** A small bony spine at the posterosuperior margin of the bony meatus, just anterior to Macewen's triangle.
*   **Cymba Concha:** The cartilaginous surface landmark corresponding to the antrum.

### Deep Landmarks
*   **[[Korner's Septum]]:** A persistent petrosquamosal suture (bony plate) separating superficial squamosal cells from deep petrosal cells. It can be mistaken for the antral floor, leading to incomplete disease removal.
*   **[[Trautmann's Triangle]]:** A triangular area on the medial wall of the mastoid antrum.
    *   *Superiorly:* [[Superior petrosal sinus]].
    *   *Posteriorly:* [[Sigmoid sinus]].
    *   *Anteriorly:* [[Posterior semicircular canal]] / bony labyrinth.
    *   *Clinical Significance:* Approach to the [[posterior cranial fossa]].
*   **[[Citelli's Angle]] (Sinodural Angle):** Formed by the junction of the dural plate (tegmen) superiorly and the sigmoid sinus plate posteriorly.
*   **[[Donaldson's Line]]:** An imaginary line passing through the [[lateral semicircular canal]] bisecting the posterior semicircular canal. The [[endolymphatic sac]] is located inferior to this line.
*   **[[Digastric Ridge]]:** A ridge in the mastoid tip corresponding to the digastric groove; serves as a landmark for the exit of the [[facial nerve]] at the [[stylomastoid foramen]].

## Types of Mastoidectomy

### 1. Cortical Mastoidectomy (Simple/Schwartz Operation)
This procedure involves the complete exenteration of all accessible mastoid air cells, converting them into a single cavity while keeping the posterior meatal wall intact.

*   **Aim:** To clear infection/pus but preserve the hearing mechanism and normal canal anatomy.
*   **Indications:**
    *   Acute coalescent [[mastoiditis]].
    *   Masked mastoiditis.
    *   Incompletely resolved [[acute otitis media]] with reservoir sign.
    *   Subperiosteal abscess.
    *   Initial step for facial nerve decompression or endolymphatic sac surgery.

**Boundaries of Exenteration:**

| Boundary | Landmark / Limit |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Superior** | [[Tegmen tympani]] (Dural plate) |
| **Posterior** | [[Sigmoid sinus]] plate |
| **Anterior** | Posterior wall of [[external auditory canal]] (Must be preserved) |
| **Inferior** | Mastoid tip / [[Digastric ridge]] |
| **Medial** | [[Lateral semicircular canal]] and [[Posterior fossa dura]] |
| **Lateral** | Mastoid cortex (removed to enter) |

### 2. Radical Mastoidectomy
A "Canal Wall Down" (CWD) procedure where the mastoid, antrum, and middle ear are converted into a single cavity.

*   **Procedure:**
    *   Removal of mastoid air cells and the **posterior meatal wall**.
    *   Removal of the **tympanic membrane**, **malleus**, **incus**, and mucoperiosteal lining.
    *   Only the **[[stapes footplate]]** is preserved.
    *   The **[[Eustachian tube]]** orifice is obliterated (plugged) with muscle or cartilage.
*   **Aim:** To exteriorize the disease completely; hearing is sacrificed to achieve a safe, dry ear.
*   **Indications:**
    *   Unresectable [[cholesteatoma]] (invading ET or petrous apex).
    *   [[Glomus tumors]].
    *   Carcinoma of the middle ear.

### 3. Modified Radical Mastoidectomy (MRM)
A modification of the radical mastoidectomy where the disease is exteriorized (CWD), but the **hearing mechanism is preserved** or reconstructed.

*   **Procedure:**
    *   Removal of posterior canal wall and lateral attic wall (Atticotomy).
    *   Removal of cholesteatoma and unhealthy tissues.
    *   **Preservation** of healthy middle ear mucosa, pars tensa, and functional ossicles (or reconstruction via [[tympanoplasty]]).
    *   The [[Eustachian tube]] is left open.
*   **Indications:**
    *   Cholesteatoma confined to the attic and antrum.
    *   Chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma where a safe ear is the priority but hearing can be saved.

**Comparison of Techniques:**

| Feature | Cortical Mastoidectomy | Radical Mastoidectomy | Modified Radical Mastoidectomy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Posterior Canal Wall** | Intact (Preserved) | Removed | Removed |
| **Middle Ear Contents** | Preserved | Removed (Malleus, Incus, TM) | Preserved/Reconstructed |
| **Eustachian Tube** | Open | **Closed/Obliterated** | Open |
| **Hearing** | Preserved | Sacrificed (Significant loss) | Preserved/Reconstructed |
| **Cavity Created** | No (Normal canal anatomy) | Yes (Exteriorized bowl) | Yes (Exteriorized bowl) |

## Surgical Concepts

### Canal Wall Up (CWU) vs. Canal Wall Down (CWD)

*   **Canal Wall Up (Intact Canal Wall):**
    *   Preserves the posterior bony canal wall.
    *   Requires a **posterior tympanotomy** (opening the facial recess) to access the middle ear.
    *   *Advantage:* Normal anatomy, no cavity problems, easier hearing aid fitting, swimming allowed.
    *   *Disadvantage:* Higher rate of residual/recurrent cholesteatoma; "second-look" surgery often required.

*   **Canal Wall Down (Open Technique):**
    *   Posterior canal wall is drilled away.
    *   *Advantage:* Lower recurrence rate (disease is exteriorized), safe ear.
    *   *Disadvantage:* Open mastoid cavity requires lifelong cleaning, potential for caloric vertigo, water precautions needed.

### Key Surgical Steps & Terms

*   **Bridge:** The superior osseous meatal wall bridging over the notch of Rivinus. It is removed in CWD procedures to exteriorize the attic.
*   **Buttresses:** Anterior and posterior bony supports of the bridge; removed to open the epitympanum fully.
*   **Facial Ridge:** The bony covering of the vertical [[facial nerve]] on the posterior canal wall. In CWD surgery, this is "lowered" (drilled down) to the level of the stylomastoid foramen to ensure the cavity is smooth and self-cleansing. A high facial ridge leads to cavity problems.
*   **[[Meatoplasty]]:** Surgical enlargement of the external auditory meatus (cartilage removal). It is **mandatory** in CWD mastoidectomy to allow aeration, easy cleaning, and inspection of the mastoid cavity.

## Complications of Mastoidectomy

### Intraoperative/Immediate
*   **[[Facial Nerve]] Injury:** Most common at the second genu or vertical segment. Heat injury from the drill or direct trauma.
*   **Labyrinthine Injury:** Damage to the [[lateral semicircular canal]] causing vertigo, nystagmus, or dead ear.
*   **Vascular Injury:** Trauma to the [[sigmoid sinus]] (profuse bleeding) or high [[jugular bulb]].
*   **Dural Injury:** Tegmen breach causing [[CSF leak]] or meningoencephalocele.
*   **Ossicular Dislocation:** Accidental dislocation of the incus leading to conductive hearing loss.

### Delayed/Late
*   **Cavity Problems (in CWD):** Persistent discharge (otorrhea), crusting, fungus, granulations. Often due to a high facial ridge, inadequate meatoplasty, or small meatus.
*   **Recurrent/Residual Cholesteatoma:** Higher risk in CWU procedures.
*   **Meatal Stenosis:** Narrowing of the ear canal opening.
*   **Perichondritis:** Of the pinna.
