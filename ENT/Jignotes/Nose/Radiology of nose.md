# Radiology of the Nose and Paranasal Sinuses

Radiological evaluation is a cornerstone in the diagnosis and management of sinonasal diseases. While [[Computed Tomography]] (CT) has largely replaced plain radiography for chronic conditions, plain films still hold a limited role in acute settings and specific fractures. [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI) is reserved for soft tissue assessment and complications.

## 1. Conventional Radiography (Plain X-rays)

Although largely superseded by CT, students must know the standard views for viva and basic screening.

### Standard Views

| View Name | Positioning | Structures Best Seen | Clinical Utility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Water’s View** (Occipitomental) | Nose and Chin touch the cassette. X-ray beam from behind. | **[[Maxillary Sinus]]** (Best view), Frontal sinus, Zygoma. | Acute maxillary sinusitis, orbital floor fractures, facial trauma. |
| **Caldwell View** (Occipitofrontal) | Nose and Forehead touch the cassette. Beam projected 15–20° caudally. | **[[Frontal Sinus]]**, **[[Ethmoid Sinus]]**, Orbital margins. | Frontal sinusitis, osteomas, ethmoid disease. |
| **Lateral View** | Lateral side of skull against film. | **[[Sphenoid Sinus]]**, **[[Adenoids]]**, Sella turcica, Nasal bones. | Adenoid hypertrophy, sphenoid pathology, foreign bodies. |
| **Submentovertical** (Base of Skull) | Vertex near film, beam from submental area. | **[[Sphenoid Sinus]]**, Posterior ethmoids, Skull base foramina. | Sphenoid disease, skull base fractures (rarely used now). |
| **Rhese View** (Oblique) | Orbitomeatal line at angle. | **[[Optic Foramen]]**. | Optic nerve pathology, posterior ethmoids. |

### X-rays for Nasal Fractures
*   **Lateral View (Soft tissue technique):** Best for depressed fractures of the [[Nasal bone]]. Both right and left views are taken to rule out artifacts.
*   **Occlusal View:** Film held between teeth; best for lateral displacement of nasal pyramid.

**Clinical Implication:**
In **Water's view**, the petrous temporal bone is projected *below* the floor of the maxillary sinus, offering an unobstructed view. If the mouth is kept **open** (Pierre’s view), the [[Sphenoid Sinus]] can also be visualized.

> **Mnemonic for Positioning:**
> *   **W**aters' = **W**atching the sky (Chin up/Nose & Chin touch).
> *   **C**aldwell = **C**ontact forehead (Nose & Forehead touch).

## 2. Computed Tomography (CT)

**NCCT (Non-Contrast CT)** of the nose and paranasal sinuses (PNS) is the **Gold Standard** investigation for inflammatory sinus disease and preoperative planning for [[Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery]] (FESS).

### Advantages of CT
*   Demonstrates the **Ostiomeatal Complex (OMC)** anatomy in detail.
*   Differentiates bone erosion (malignancy) from bone expansion (benign/mucocele).
*   Essential for staging tumors and trauma assessment.

### Standard Cuts/Planes
1.  **Coronal Plane:** The most important view for FESS. Simulates the "surgical view" of the surgeon. Best for visualizing the [[Uncinate Process]], [[Middle Turbinate]], and skull base.
2.  **Axial Plane:** Best for visualizing the anterior and posterior walls of sinuses, [[Sphenoid Sinus]], and posterior ethmoids.

### Key Anatomical Variations seen on CT (FESS Checklist)
Before surgery, the surgeon reviews the CT for "High Risk" areas to prevent complications:

*   **[[Agger Nasi Cell]]:** Anterior-most ethmoid cell. Can narrow the frontal recess.
*   **[[Haller Cell]] (Infraorbital Ethmoid Cell):** Located in the floor of the orbit/roof of maxillary sinus. Can narrow the maxillary ostium.
*   **[[Onodi Cell]] (Sphenoethmoidal Cell):** Posterior ethmoid cell that extends laterally/superiorly to the sphenoid. **Risk:** The [[Optic Nerve]] may be dehiscent within this cell.
*   **[[Concha Bullosa]]:** Pneumatized middle turbinate. Can obstruct the middle meatus.
*   **Dehiscent Lamina Papyracea:** Risk of orbital injury.
*   **Low-lying Cribriform Plate (Keros Classification):** Risk of CSF leak.

**Clinical Implication:**
In chronic rhinosinusitis, CT is usually performed *after* a course of medical therapy to assess irreversible disease vs. reversible mucosal edema.

## 3. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

MRI is **not** the first-line investigation for routine sinusitis because it does not visualize cortical bone well (bone appears black/signal void). It is complementary to CT.

### Indications for MRI
1.  **Complications of Sinusitis:** To rule out intracranial extension (abscess, meningitis) or orbital extension.
2.  **Tumors:** Superior soft tissue resolution.
    *   Differentiates **Tumor** (enhances) from **Retained Secretions** (does not enhance/bright on T2).
    *   Assess perineural spread and dural involvement.
3.  **Fungal Sinusitis:** Fungal concretions appear as **signal voids** (black) on T2-weighted images due to heavy metals (iron/manganese) in fungal hyphae.

### MRI Sequences
*   **T1 Weighted:** Good for anatomy. Fat is bright; fluid is dark.
*   **T2 Weighted:** Good for pathology. Fluid/inflammation is bright (Hyperintense).
*   **Gadolinium Contrast:** Enhances vascular tumors and inflammatory margins.

## 4. Other Imaging Modalities

*   **Angiography (DSA):**
    *   Used for vascular tumors like [[Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma]] (JNA).
    *   Diagnostic: Shows "Tumor Blush."
    *   Therapeutic: Pre-operative embolization of feeding vessels (usually Internal Maxillary Artery) to reduce bleeding.
*   **Ultrasonography:**
    *   Limited use in nose. Can be used for superficial masses (dermoids) or orbital complications.
*   **Dacryocystography:**
    *   Contrast study to visualize the [[Nasolacrimal Duct]] system in epiphora.
