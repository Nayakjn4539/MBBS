# [[Asphyxia]] > Drowning

### Definition
[[Drowning]] is defined as a process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion or immersion in a liquid.
*   **Old Definition:** Death resulting from [[asphyxia]] caused by the immersion of the body (or just the nose and mouth) in fluid, usually water.
*   **Modern Consensus (World Congress on Drowning, 2002):** Drowning is the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid. The outcome may be death, morbidity, or no morbidity. Terms like "near-drowning", "wet/dry drowning", and "secondary drowning" were recommended to be discarded in clinical settings, though they remain relevant for forensic classification and understanding pathology.

### Classification of Drowning

**1. Based on Mechanism (Pathophysiology)**

| Type | Description | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Typical (Wet) Drowning** | Water enters the lungs. | Water crosses the alveolar membrane causing electrolyte imbalance and asphyxia. |
| **Atypical Drowning** | Water does not strictly enter the lungs or mechanism is different. | Includes Dry drowning, Immersion syndrome, etc. |

**2. Based on the Nature of Water**
*   **[[Fresh Water Drowning]]:** Occurs in ponds, rivers, lakes (Hypotonic medium).
*   **[[Salt Water Drowning]]:** Occurs in oceans, seas (Hypertonic medium).

**3. Specific/Atypical Forms**
*   **[[Dry Drowning]]:** Water enters the nasopharynx/larynx causing intense **[[laryngeal spasm]]**. No water enters the lungs. Death occurs due to asphyxia. Seen in 10–15% of cases.
*   **[[Immersion Syndrome]] (Hydrocution):** Sudden death upon contact with cold water. Caused by **[[vagal inhibition]]** resulting in cardiac arrest. No signs of drowning are found at autopsy.
*   **Secondary Drowning (Near Drowning):** Death occurs after a latent period (minutes to days) following rescue, usually due to chemical pneumonitis, metabolic acidosis, or electrolyte disturbances.
*   **Shallow Water Drowning:** Drowning in very shallow water (e.g., a puddle, drain) often occurring in unconscious subjects (epileptics, drunks).
*   **Submersion of the Unconscious:** Victim is unconscious (epilepsy, heart attack, head injury) before falling into water. No struggle, ballooning of lungs is less marked (**Oedema Aquosum**).

### Classification of Events (The "Drowning Process")
When a conscious person falls into water, the sequence of events (described by **Brouardel**) typically follows five stages:

1.  **Stage of Surprise (5–10 seconds):**
    *   Deep inspiration occurs due to the shock of cold water.
    *   Victim struggles to keep the head above water level.
2.  **Stage of Respiratory Arrest / Breath Holding (1 minute):**
    *   Victim holds breath instinctively to prevent water entry.
    *   Leads to accumulation of CO2 and hypoxia.
3.  **Stage of Deep Respiration / Dyspnea (1 minute):**
    *   The "Breaking Point" is reached; victim can no longer hold breath.
    *   Forced inhalation occurs, leading to aspiration of water.
    *   Water mixes with air and mucus, creating **fine froth**.
4.  **Stage of Respiratory Arrest / Convulsions (1 minute):**
    *   Loss of consciousness.
    *   Violent convulsions due to cerebral hypoxia.
    *   Pupils dilate, reflexes are lost.
5.  **Stage of Terminal Gasps (30 seconds):**
    *   Final, irregular respiratory efforts.
    *   Death ensues.

*   **Total Fatal Period:** 3 to 5 minutes in fresh water; slightly longer (4–8 minutes) in salt water.

### Pathophysiology: Fresh Water vs. Salt Water

| Feature | [[Fresh Water Drowning]] | [[Salt Water Drowning]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tonicity** | Hypotonic to blood. | Hypertonic to blood. |
| **Fluid Movement** | Water moves from alveoli **into** circulation (Haemodilution). | Fluid moves from circulation **into** alveoli (Haemoconcentration). |
| **Blood Volume** | Increases (Hypervolemia - up to 50% increase). | Decreases (Hypovolemia - shock). |
| **Electrolytes** | **Hyperkalemia** (RBC lysis), Hyponatremia. | **Hypernatremia**, Hypermagnesemia. |
| **RBCs** | Hemolysis (bursting of RBCs). | Crenation (shrinking of RBCs). |
| **Cause of Death** | **Ventricular Fibrillation** (due to K+ overload and anoxia). | **Asphyxia** / Pulmonary Edema / Cardiac standstill (Asystole). |
| **Lungs at Autopsy** | Stiff, ballooned, retain shape (**Emphysema Aquosum**). | Heavy, boggy, sodden, do not retain shape (**Oedema Aquosum**). |

**Mnemonic:**
*   **F**resh water = **F**ibrillation (Ventricular).
*   **S**alt water = **S**tandstill (Cardiac) / **S**welling (Pulmonary edema).

### Autopsy Findings

**1. External Findings**
*   **[[Froth]]:** Fine, white, lathery, persistent froth at mouth and nostrils. It increases on compression of the chest. It is a vital sign (formed by churning of water, air, mucus, and surfactant).
*   **[[Cadaveric Spasm]]:** Firm grasping of weeds, grass, or mud in hands. Pathognomonic of antemortem drowning.
*   **Cutis Anserina (Goose Flesh):** Due to contraction of erector pilae muscles (rigor mortis of muscles). Not diagnostic (can happen if body thrown in water after death).
*   **Washerwoman’s Hands/Feet:** Bleached, sodden, wrinkled skin. Appears in 12–24 hours. Indicates prolonged immersion, not necessarily cause of death.

**2. Internal Findings**
*   **Lungs:**
    *   **[[Emphysema Aquosum]]:** Lungs are voluminous, ballooned, cover the pericardium, and have "rib markings" (indentations). Common in fresh water.
    *   **[[Paltauf’s Hemorrhages]]:** Large, pale bluish-red subpleural hemorrhages due to alveolar rupture (seen in 50% cases).
*   **Respiratory Tract:** Presence of foreign material (sand, weeds, mud) in trachea/bronchi.
*   **Stomach:** Presence of water (especially if >500ml and characteristic of the drowning medium).
*   **Middle Ear:** Hemorrhage in the middle ear and mastoid air cells (due to barotrauma).

### Laboratory Tests for Drowning

1.  **[[Diatom Test]]:**
    *   **Principle:** Diatoms (microscopic unicellular algae with silica walls) are inhaled, breach the alveolar membrane, enter systemic circulation, and lodge in distant organs (brain, bone marrow) only if circulation is active (Antemortem).
    *   **Procedure:** Acid digestion of bone marrow (femur/sternum) to destroy organic tissue; silica shells of diatoms remain.
    *   **Validity:** Highly reliable if diatoms in tissue match those in the drowning medium.
2.  **Gettler’s Test (Chloride Test):** Comparison of chloride content between right and left heart blood. (Obsolete/Unreliable).
    *   Fresh water: Left heart Cl- < Right heart Cl-.
    *   Salt water: Left heart Cl- > Right heart Cl-.

### Medicolegal Aspects
1.  **Accidental:** Most common (swimmers, children, epileptics, intoxicated persons).
2.  **Suicidal:** Common. Bodies may be found with "hesitation marks" or weights attached.
3.  **Homicidal:** Rare. Usually involves forceful submersion (e.g., brides in dowry deaths, infants in buckets). Look for signs of struggle or injuries not consistent with simple fall.
4.  **Disposal of Body:** A person killed by other means and thrown into water. In these cases:
    *   No fine froth.
    *   No water in middle ear.
    *   No diatoms in bone marrow.
    *   Lungs not ballooned (collapsed).
