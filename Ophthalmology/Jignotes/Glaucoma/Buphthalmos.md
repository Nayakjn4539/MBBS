# Buphthalmos (Primary Congenital Glaucoma)

[[Buphthalmos]] (Bull-like eyes) or [[Primary Congenital Glaucoma]] (PCG) refers to a condition of abnormally high [[intraocular pressure]] (IOP) resulting from a developmental anomaly of the angle of the [[anterior chamber]], not associated with other ocular or systemic anomalies. The term Buphthalmos is specifically used when the disease manifests prior to the age of 3 years, causing enlargement of the eyeball due to the distensibility of the [[sclera]] and [[cornea]] in this age group.

### Epidemiology and Genetics
*   **Prevalence:** Approximately 1 in 10,000 live births.
*   **Gender:** Affects boys more than girls (65% males).
*   **Laterality:** Bilateral in approximately 70% of cases, though involvement may be asymmetric.
*   **Inheritance:**
    *   Most cases are **Sporadic** (90%).
    *   Approximately 10% show **Autosomal Recessive** inheritance.
    *   Genetic loci linked include **GLC3A** (2p21), **GLC3B** (1p36), and **GLC3C** (14q24).
    *   The **[[CYP1B1]]** gene mutation is strongly associated with PCG.

### Classification
Based on the age of onset, developmental glaucomas are classified as:

| Type | Age of Onset | Characteristics | Frequency |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Newborn / True Congenital** | Intrauterine / At birth | Born with ocular enlargement | ~40% |
| **Infantile Glaucoma** | < 3 years | Manifests before 3rd birthday | ~55% |
| **Juvenile Glaucoma** | 3 to 16 years (or adulthood) | Pressure rise after 3 years; eye does not enlarge | ~5% |

### Etiopathogenesis
The primary mechanism is **[[Trabeculodysgenesis]]** (maldevelopment of the trabecular meshwork).
*   **Failure of angle recess development:** The iris insertion remains flat or concave relative to the trabecular meshwork.
*   **Barkan’s Membrane:** Historically, it was believed a persistent membrane covered the [[trabecular meshwork]], preventing aqueous outflow.
*   **Iris Insertion:**
    *   **Flat insertion:** Iris inserts abruptly into the thickened trabeculum.
    *   **Concave insertion:** Iris tissue sweeps over the iridotrabecular junction.

### Clinical Features
#### Symptoms
The classic triad of symptoms in an infant includes:
1.  **[[Epiphora]]** (Lacrimation/Watering)
2.  **[[Photophobia]]** (Intolerance to light)
3.  **[[Blepharospasm]]** (Squeezing of eyes)

*   **Note:** Eye rubbing is a common history provided by parents.

#### Signs

**1. Cornea**
*   **Enlargement:** Corneal diameter **> 13 mm** is diagnostic (Normal newborn: ~10.5 mm).
*   **Edema:** Earliest sign. Initially epithelial, giving a "frosted glass" appearance.
*   **[[Haab's Striae]]:** Breaks in the [[Descemet's membrane]] due to stretching. They appear as horizontal or concentric opaque lines with double contours.
    *   *Clinical Implication:* Vertical striae are usually indicative of birth trauma (forceps injury).

**2. Sclera**
*   **[[Blue Sclera]]:** The sclera becomes thin and translucent, making the underlying [[uveal tissue]] visible, giving a bluish hue.

**3. Anterior Chamber**
*   **Deep Anterior Chamber:** Due to the stretching of the globe.

**4. Iris and Lens**
*   **[[Iridodonesis]]:** Tremulousness of iris due to lack of lens support.
*   **Lens:** Becomes anteroposteriorly flat and may subluxate backward due to stretching of [[zonules]].

**5. Refraction**
*   **[[Axial Myopia]]:** Due to increased axial length of the eyeball. This may lead to anisometropic [[amblyopia]].

**6. Optic Disc**
*   **Cupping:** Variable cupping occurs. Interestingly, cupping in infants may be **reversible** if IOP is controlled early, as the lamina cribrosa is elastic.

### Assessment: Examination Under Anesthesia (EUA)
Since scleral rigidity is low in children and cooperation is poor, assessment is performed under general anesthesia.

**Parameters checked:**
1.  **[[Intraocular Pressure]] (IOP):** preferably using a **[[Perkins tonometer]]** or **[[Tonopen]]**. (Schiotz is inaccurate due to low scleral rigidity).
2.  **Corneal Diameter:** Measured with calipers (Horizontal white-to-white).
3.  **[[Gonioscopy]]:** Using a **Koeppe’s lens** (direct gonioscopy) to visualize trabeculodysgenesis.
4.  **Ophthalmoscopy:** To evaluate optic disc cupping.

### Differential Diagnosis
Conditions presenting with **Cloudy Cornea** in neonates (Mnemonic: **STUMPED**):
*   **S** - [[Sclerocornea]]
*   **T** - Trauma (Forceps injury - vertical tears)
*   **U** - Ulcer (Corneal)
*   **M** - [[Mucopolysaccharidosis]] / Metabolic
*   **P** - [[Peter's anomaly]]
*   **E** - [[Endothelial dystrophy]] (CHED)
*   **D** - [[Dermoid]]

Conditions presenting with **Large Cornea**:
*   **[[Megalocornea]]:** X-linked, non-progressive, normal IOP.
*   **High Myopia**.

### Management
Treatment is primarily surgical because medical therapy is often ineffective for long-term control.

#### Medical Management (Temporizing)
Used to lower IOP and clear corneal edema prior to surgery.
*   **Topical [[Beta-blockers]]:** e.g., Timolol 0.5% (Drug of choice).
*   **Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors:** Oral Acetazolamide or topical Dorzolamide.
*   **Contraindication:** **[[Brimonidine]]** (Alpha-2 agonist) causes CNS depression and apnea in infants.
*   **Miotics:** Pilocarpine is generally not used as it may paradoxically increase IOP.

#### Surgical Management
**1. [[Goniotomy]]**
*   **Indication:** Treatment of choice when the **cornea is clear**.
*   **Procedure:** A Barkan’s goniotomy knife is passed across the AC to incise the superficial layers of the trabecular meshwork (approx 75 degrees).
*   **Success rate:** ~85%.

**2. [[Trabeculotomy]]**
*   **Indication:** When the **cornea is hazy** (making goniotomy impossible).
*   **Procedure:** External approach where Schlemm’s canal is cannulated with a trabeculotome and ruptured inwards into the anterior chamber.

**3. Combined Trabeculotomy + [[Trabeculectomy]]**
*   Standard procedure in advanced cases or when initial surgeries fail. Often used with antimetabolites (Mitomycin C) to prevent fibrosis.

**4. Glaucoma Drainage Devices (GDD) / Cyclodestruction**
*   Reserved for recalcitrant cases.

### Prognosis
*   Best prognosis if onset is between 2 months and 1 year.
*   Prognosis is poor if glaucoma is present at birth or if corneal diameter is >16mm.
*   Untreated cases lead to blindness due to optic nerve damage and corneal scarring.
