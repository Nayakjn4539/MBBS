| **Acute Pancreatitis** A condition characterized by reversible pancreatic parenchymal injury and inflammation. | **Metabolic:** Alcoholism, hyperlipoproteinemia, hypercalcemia, drugs (e.g., azathioprine).  **Mechanical:** Gallstones, trauma, iatrogenic injury (ERCP).  **Vascular:** Shock, atheroembolism, vasculitis.  **Infectious:** Mumps, coxsackievirus.  **Genetic:** Inherited mutations. | Biliary tract disease and alcoholism account for ~80% of cases. Gallstones are present in 35% to 60% of cases. | Results from inappropriate activation of pancreatic enzymes, leading to autodigestion. Three main initiating events: 1. **Pancreatic duct obstruction:** Raises intraductal pressure, leads to accumulation of enzyme-rich fluid. Lipase causes fat necrosis, which produces "danger" signals. 2. **Primary acinar cell injury:** Direct injury from toxins, viruses, ischemia, or trauma leads to release of digestive enzymes. Oxidative stress and increased intracellular calcium are key triggers for enzyme activation. 3. **Defective intracellular transport:** Proenzymes are delivered to lysosomes where they are activated by hydrolases (e.g., cathepsin), leading to cell disruption. Protective mechanisms (enzyme synthesis as zymogens, secretion of trypsin inhibitors like SPINK1) are overwhelmed. | Hereditary pancreatitis is associated with defects that increase or sustain trypsin activity:  - **PRSS1 (trypsinogen 1 gene):** Gain-of-function mutations make trypsin resistant to self-inactivation or more prone to activation (autosomal dominant).  - **SPINK1 (trypsin inhibitor gene):** Loss-of-function mutations reduce trypsin inhibition (autosomal recessive).  - **CFTR (cystic fibrosis gene):** Mutations alter fluid and bicarbonate secretion, leading to protein plugging and duct obstruction.  - **CASR (Calcium-sensing receptor):** Mutations may alter calcium concentrations and activate trypsin. | Ranges from mild inflammation and edema to extensive necrosis and hemorrhage.  - **Mild form:** Pancreas shows edema and focal fat necrosis.  - **Severe form (Hemorrhagic pancreatitis):** Extensive parenchymal necrosis with hemorrhage gives a red-black appearance, with interspersed foci of yellow-white, chalky fat necrosis. Peritoneal cavity contains serous, brown-tinged fluid with fat globules. | - **Acute interstitial pancreatitis (mild):** Mild inflammation, interstitial edema, and focal fat necrosis. Fat necrosis leads to **saponification**, where fatty acids and calcium form soaps, appearing as granular blue deposits.  - **Acute necrotizing pancreatitis (severe):** Necrosis of acini, ducts, and islets. Vascular injury leads to hemorrhage. | - Cardinal symptom: Constant, intense abdominal pain, often referred to the upper/mid back and left shoulder.  - Anorexia, nausea, and vomiting are common.  - Severe cases are a medical emergency, presenting with an acute abdomen and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). | - **Serum lipase:** Most specific and sensitive marker. Remains elevated for 8-14 days.  - **Serum amylase:** Elevated in first 4-12 hours, returns to normal in 3-5 days.  - **Hypocalcemia:** May result from saponification of necrotic fat.  - **CT scan:** Useful for direct visualization of the enlarged, inflamed pancreas. | - **Acute interstitial pancreatitis** (limited inflammation and edema).  - **Acute necrotizing pancreatitis** (necrosis of acini, ducts, islets).  - **Hemorrhagic pancreatitis** (extensive necrosis with hemorrhage). | Systemic organ failure (acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure), shock, DIC, leukocytosis. Possible sequelae include sterile pancreatic abscesses and pancreatic pseudocysts. Infected necrotic debris can occur. | "Resting" the pancreas by total elimination of oral intake. Supportive therapy with intravenous fluids and analgesia. |
| **Chronic Pancreatitis** Prolonged inflammation of the pancreas associated with irreversible destruction of exocrine parenchyma, fibrosis, and in late stages, loss of endocrine parenchyma. | - Long-term alcohol use (most common cause).  - Long-standing obstruction of the pancreatic duct (calculi, neoplasms).  - Autoimmune injury.  - Hereditary factors (up to 25% of cases). | Most affected patients are middle-aged males with history of long-term alcohol use. Repeated bouts of acute pancreatitis. | Often follows repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis. Recurrent injury leads to a sequence of perilobular fibrosis, duct distortion, and altered secretions. Local production of fibrogenic cytokines like **transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)** and **platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)** induce activation and proliferation of pancreatic stellate cells, leading to collagen deposition and irreversible fibrosis and acinar loss. | Hereditary factors are similar to those in acute pancreatitis, including mutations in **PRSS1**, **SPINK1**, and **CFTR**. Patients with PRSS1-associated hereditary pancreatitis have a 40% lifetime risk of pancreatic cancer. | Gland is hard, sometimes with visibly dilated ducts containing calcified concretions (pancreatic calculi). | Key features:  - Parenchymal fibrosis.  - Acinar atrophy and dropout.  - Chronic inflammatory infiltrate surrounding lobules and ducts.  - Relative sparing of islets of Langerhans, which become embedded in sclerotic tissue.  - Ductal dilation and intraluminal protein plugs/calcifications (especially in alcoholic type). | - Repeated attacks of mild to moderately severe abdominal pain or persistent abdominal/back pain.  - Can be entirely silent until pancreatic insufficiency (weight loss, malabsorption) and diabetes mellitus develop.  - Jaundice may occur due to gallstone-induced obstruction. | - Serum amylase may be mildly elevated during attacks but is often absent in late-stage disease due to acinar cell loss.  - Visualization of calcifications by CT and ultrasonography is very helpful. | **Autoimmune Pancreatitis:** A pathogenically distinct form.  - **Type 1:** Associated with IgG4-secreting plasma cells, storiform fibrosis, and is a manifestation of systemic IgG4-related disease.  - **Type 2:** Restricted to the pancreas, characterized by neutrophilic infiltrates in ducts (granulocytic epithelial lesions). | Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, chronic malabsorption, diabetes mellitus, severe chronic pain, pancreatic pseudocysts (develop in ~10% of patients), modestly elevated risk of pancreatic cancer. | - |
| **Pseudocyst (Non-neoplastic Cysts of Pancreas)** A collection formed when areas of intrapancreatic or peripancreatic hemorrhagic fat necrosis are walled off by fibrosis and granulation tissue. Lacks an epithelial lining. | - A bout of acute pancreatitis (especially when superimposed on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis). - Traumatic injury to the pancreas. | History of acute or chronic pancreatitis, trauma. | Areas of hemorrhagic fat necrosis are walled off by fibrosis and granulation tissue. | - | Usually solitary, 2-30 cm in diameter. Poorly defined cyst with a necrotic, brown-black wall. Can be located within the pancreas or in the lesser omental sac or retroperitoneum. | Lined by fibrous tissue and granulation tissue. **Crucially, they lack a true epithelial lining**, distinguishing them from true cysts. | - | - | - | Secondary infection, compression of adjacent structures, or perforation. | Many resolve spontaneously. Larger or infected pseudocysts may require drainage. |
| **Congenital cysts of Pancreas** Unilocular, thin-walled cysts that likely result from anomalous pancreatic duct development. | Anomalous pancreatic duct development. Can be sporadic or part of an inherited condition. | Associated with inherited conditions like **autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease** and **von Hippel-Lindau disease**. | - | - | Range from microscopic to 5 cm. Thin, fibrous capsule filled with clear serous fluid. | Lined by a uniform cuboidal epithelium, which can be flattened and attenuated due to intracystic pressure. | Usually incidental findings. | - | - | Frequently coexist with cysts in the kidney and liver. In von Hippel-Lindau disease, associated with vascular neoplasms in the retina and cerebellum/brain stem. | - |
| **Cystic Neoplasms of Pancreas** Diverse tumors ranging from benign cysts to precancerous lesions. Account for 5-15% of all pancreatic cysts. | Arise from pancreatic epithelium. Specific mutations drive different subtypes. | Depends on subtype: Serous (older women), Mucinous (women), IPMN (men). | Pathogenesis is distinct for each subtype, driven by a specific set of genetic mutations affecting signaling pathways like Wnt signaling. | - **Serous: VHL** gene inactivation.  - **Mucinous: KRAS, TP53, SMAD4, RNF43** mutations.  - **IPMN: GNAS, KRAS, RNF43, TP53, SMAD4** mutations.  - **Solid-pseudopapillary: CTNNB1** activating mutations. | - **Serous:** Tail of pancreas, honeycomb of small cysts (1-3mm), clear/straw-colored fluid.  - **Mucinous:** Tail of pancreas, large cysts, thick/tenacious mucin.  - **IPMN:** Head of pancreas, involves large ducts, mucin-producing. | - **Serous:** Lined by glycogen-rich cuboidal cells.  - **Mucinous:** Columnar mucin-producing epithelium with a dense **ovarian-like stroma**.  - **IPMN:** Papillary growth within pancreatic ducts, **lacks ovarian stroma**. | - **Serous:** Nonspecific abdominal pain or incidental.  - **Mucinous:** Painless, slow-growing mass.  - **IPMN:** Can cause pancreatitis.  - **Solid-pseudopapillary:** Abdominal discomfort due to large size. | Imaging (CT, MRI). Endoscopic ultrasound with fluid analysis for molecular markers can help classify cysts. | - **Serous cystic neoplasm** (almost always benign).  - **Mucinous cystic neoplasm** (precursor to invasive carcinoma).  - **Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN)** (precancerous).  - **Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm** (low-grade malignancy). | Mucinous neoplasms and IPMNs can progress to invasive, lethal adenocarcinoma. | Surgical resection is curative for non-invasive lesions. Early detection is critical for mucinous types and IPMNs. |
| **Pancreatic Carcinoma** (Ductal Adenocarcinoma) Infiltrating adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. with a dismal survival rate. | Arises from non-invasive precursor lesions called **pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN)** in small ducts. | - Strongest environmental influence: **Cigarette smoking**.  - Chronic pancreatitis.  - Visceral obesity and high BMI.  - Diabetes mellitus.  - Inherited germline mutations (~10% of cases). | Stepwise accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations in ductal cells.  - Progression Model: Normal duct -> Low-grade PanIN -> High-grade PanIN -> Invasive Carcinoma.  - Key steps: Telomere shortening and activating **KRAS** mutations are earliest events, followed by inactivation of **CDKN2A**, and then inactivation of **TP53, SMAD4,** and **BRCA2** in high-grade lesions. | **Somatic mutations:**  - **KRAS:** Most frequent oncogene (>90%).  - **CDKN2A (p16):** Inactivated tumor suppressor (30%).  - **SMAD4:** Inactivated tumor suppressor (55%).  - **TP53:** Inactivated tumor suppressor (70-75%).  **Germline mutations:** **BRCA2** is most common, others include **STK11, PRSS1, CDKN2A, ATM, PALB2, MLH1, MSH2**. | Hard, stellate, gray-white, poorly defined masses. Most (60%) arise in the head of the pancreas, causing obstruction of the common bile duct. Tumors in the body/tail are often large and widely disseminated at diagnosis. | Highly invasive adenocarcinomas that elicit an intense **desmoplastic response** (dense collagen stroma). Forms abortive tubular structures or cell clusters. **Perineural invasion**, lymphatic, and large vessel invasion are common and characteristic. | - Typically silent until late stage.  - **Pain** is usually the first (and late) symptom.  - **Obstructive jaundice** is common with head tumors, leading to the **Courvoisier sign** (palpably enlarged, nontender gallbladder).  - Weight loss, anorexia, weakness.  - **Trousseau sign** (migratory thrombophlebitis) in 10% of patients.  - New-onset diabetes in older adults can be an early sign. | - **CA19-9 antigen** and **carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)**: Elevated but lack specificity for screening; used for monitoring treatment response.  - Imaging (endoscopic ultrasound, CT) is used for diagnosis. | - Precursor lesion: **Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PanIN)**, graded as low or high.  - Molecular Subtypes: **Basal-like** (highly aggressive) and **Classical** (more favorable prognosis). | Highly invasive with extension into retroperitoneum, nerves, and blood vessels. Distant metastases, mainly to liver and lungs. Obstruction of common bile duct. | Surgical resection is the only hope for cure but >80% are unresectable at diagnosis. Cancers with DNA repair defects (e.g., BRCA mutations) or microsatellite instability may respond to targeted therapies or immune checkpoint inhibitors. |
| **Acinar Cell Carcinoma** Malignant neoplasm of acinar cells that forms zymogen granules and produces exocrine enzymes. | Arises from pancreatic acinar cells. | - | Demonstrates aberrant **Wnt pathway activation**. | - Loss-of-function mutations of the **APC** tumor suppressor gene. - Activating point mutations of **CTNNB1** (encodes β-catenin). | - | Forms zymogen granules and produces exocrine enzymes like trypsin and lipase. | - | - | - | **Metastatic fat necrosis syndrome** occurs in up to 15% of patients due to release of lipase into the circulation, causing subcutaneous fat necrosis. | - |
