# [[HEALTH CARE OF THE COMMUNITY]] > Enumerate the principles of PHC. How is it delivered in rural area

### Principles of Primary Health Care (PHC)

The concept of [[Primary Health Care]] was defined in the **Alma-Ata Declaration (1978)**. It is based on four main pillars or principles:

**1. Equitable Distribution (Equity)**
*   This is the **first key principle**. Health services must be shared equally by all people irrespective of their ability to pay, caste, color, or creed.
*   It aims to address the imbalance where health services are concentrated in urban areas (where 25% of the population lives) while the rural population (75%) is underserved.
*   **Goal:** To shift the center of gravity of the health care system from cities to rural areas and bring services as near to people's homes as possible.

**2. Community Participation**
*   Health cannot be achieved by the government alone; the involvement of individuals, families, and communities is essential.
*   Communities must participate in planning, implementation, and maintenance of health services.
*   **Example:** The use of [[ASHA]] (Accredited Social Health Activist) and Village Health Guides is a prime example of involving the community to bridge the cultural gap.

**3. Intersectoral Coordination**
*   Health is not an isolated sector. The components of PHC cannot be provided by the health sector alone.
*   It requires the joint effort of the health sector and other related sectors such as:
    *   Agriculture (for nutrition/food security)
    *   Education (for health literacy)
    *   Housing and Public Works (for sanitation/water)
    *   Communication.

**4. Appropriate Technology**
*   Technology should be:
    *   **Scientifically sound**
    *   **Adaptable to local needs**
    *   **Culturally acceptable** to the community
    *   **Affordable** by the community and country.
*   *Clinical Relevance:* The use of [[Oral Rehydration Solution]] (ORS) for diarrhea instead of expensive IV fluids, or using a stand-alone vaccine carrier instead of large refrigerators in remote areas.

### Delivery of Primary Health Care in Rural Areas

The delivery of health care in rural India is based on a **3-Tier System** recommended by the **Shrivastav Committee (1975)**. It links the village to the district level.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a pyramid showing the 3-tier structure: Sub-centre at the base, PHC in the middle, and CHC at the top, supported by Village level workers below the base.

#### 1. Village Level (Grassroots Level)
Before the official 3-tier system, health care is provided at the doorstep by:
*   **[[ASHA]] (Accredited Social Health Activist):** One ASHA per **1,000 population**. She acts as a bridge between the community and the health system.
*   **Anganwadi Worker (AWW):** Under the [[ICDS]] scheme, covering **400-800 population**.
*   **Village Health Guide (VHG) / Trained Dai:** One per 1,000 population.

#### 2. Sub-Centre (SC) level / Health & Wellness Centre (HWC)
*   **Most peripheral contact point** between the Primary Health Care system and the community.
*   **Population Norm:**
    *   **Hilly/Tribal/Difficult areas:** 3,000
    *   **Plain areas:** 5,000
*   **Staff:** 3 personnel (Health Worker Female/ANM, Health Worker Male, and a Voluntary worker).
*   **Functions:** MCH, Family planning, Immunization, Nutrition education.
*   *Note:* Funded 100% by the Central Government.

#### 3. Primary Health Centre (PHC) Level
*   **First contact point with a qualified Medical Officer.**
*   **Population Norm:**
    *   **Hilly/Tribal/Difficult areas:** 20,000
    *   **Plain areas:** 30,000
*   **Staff:** Total **15** personnel, including **1 Medical Officer**, Pharmacist, Nurse-Midwife, Health Assistants, etc.
*   **Bed Strength:** 4 to 6 beds.
*   **Function:** Acts as a **Referral Unit for 6 Sub-centres**. Provides curative, preventive, and promotive care.
*   *Note:* Established and maintained by State Governments under the Minimum Needs Programme (MNP).

#### 4. Community Health Centre (CHC) Level
*   **Secondary Level of Health Care.**
*   **Population Norm:**
    *   **Hilly/Tribal/Difficult areas:** 80,000
    *   **Plain areas:** 1,20,000
*   **Staff:** Total **30-31** personnel. Must have **4 Medical Specialists** (Surgeon, Physician, Gynecologist, Pediatrician).
*   **Bed Strength:** 30 beds.
*   **Function:** It serves as the **[[First Referral Unit]] (FRU)** for 4 PHCs. It provides facilities for obstetric care, X-ray, and Laboratory.
