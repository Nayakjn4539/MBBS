# [[Meniere's Disease]] (Endolymphatic Hydrops)

**Meniere's Disease**, also known as **Idiopathic Endolymphatic Hydrops**, is a disorder of the [[inner ear]] characterized by distension of the endolymphatic system. It is a clinical syndrome defined by a classic tetrad of symptoms.

### Epidemiology
*   **Age:** Commonly affects adults between **35–60 years**.
*   **Sex:** Males are affected slightly more than or equal to females.
*   **Laterality:** Usually unilateral at onset; however, the other ear may be involved in **50%** of cases over time.

### Etiology and Pathogenesis
The exact cause is unknown (Idiopathic). If a specific cause is identified (e.g., trauma, syphilis), it is termed **Meniere's Syndrome** or Secondary Endolymphatic Hydrops.

#### 1. Pathophysiology
*   **Mechanism:** There is an increase in the volume of [[endolymph]] causing distension of the membranous labyrinth (Scala Media).
*   **Underlying Defect:** Can be due to **Increased Production** (by stria vascularis) or **Defective Absorption** (by the [[endolymphatic sac]]).
*   **The Cycle of Attack:**
    1.  Progressive distension of the [[membranous labyrinth]].
    2.  Rupture of [[Reissner's membrane]].
    3.  Mixing of potassium-rich endolymph with perilymph.
    4.  The potassium-rich fluid is toxic to hair cells and nerve fibers, causing depolarization blockade (paralysis) $\rightarrow$ **Acute Vertigo and Hearing Loss**.
    5.  Healing of the membrane restores chemical balance $\rightarrow$ Remission of symptoms.

#### 2. Predisposing Factors (Theories)
*   **Defective Absorption:** Ischemia or fibrosis of the endolymphatic sac.
*   **Vasomotor Disturbance:** Sympathetic overactivity causing spasm of the internal auditory artery.
*   **Allergy:** Inner ear acts as a "shock organ" (food or inhalants).
*   **Sodium and Water Retention.**
*   **Autoimmune:** Linked to HLA B8/DR3.

### Clinical Features
The disease is characterized by episodic attacks with symptom-free intervals.

#### 1. The Classic Tetrad
| Symptom | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Vertigo]]** | • **Episodic:** Sudden onset, rotatory (spinning).<br>• **Duration:** Lasts **20 minutes to 24 hours**.<br>• Associated with nausea, vomiting, sweating (vagal symptoms).<br>• Nystagmus is present during the attack. |
| **[[Hearing Loss]]** | • **Sensorineural:** Fluctuating and progressive.<br>• **Low frequencies** are affected first (rising curve).<br>• **[[Diplacusis]]** (Binaural): The same sound is perceived as different pitches in the two ears. |
| **[[Tinnitus]]** | • Low-pitched, roaring type (like the ocean).<br>• Subjective and non-pulsatile.<br>• Aggravated during acute attacks. |
| **Aural Fullness** | • Sense of pressure or blocking in the ear.<br>• Often precedes an attack (Warning sign/Aura). |

**Clinical Implication:** Patients often exhibit **[[Recruitment]]** (intolerance to loud sounds). They hear soft sounds poorly but loud sounds become unbearable, making them poor candidates for standard hearing aids.

#### 2. Variants of Meniere's Disease
*   **Cochlear Hydrops:** Fluctuating hearing loss and tinnitus without vertigo. May develop vertigo later.
*   **Vestibular Hydrops:** Episodic vertigo without hearing loss initially.
*   **[[Lermoyez Syndrome]] (Reverse Meniere's):** Progressive hearing loss occurs *before* the attack. The hearing **improves** immediately after the episode of vertigo.
    *   *Mnemonic:* **L**er-**M**oyez $\rightarrow$ **L**istening problem first, then **M**otion sickness (Vertigo).
*   **Tumarkin's Otolithic Crisis (Drop Attacks):** Sudden drop attack without loss of consciousness due to deformation of the utricle/saccule affecting vestibulospinal reflexes.

### Examination Findings

#### 1. Otoscopy
*   **Tympanic Membrane:** Usually **Normal**. (Crucial to rule out CSOM).
*   **Hennebert’s Sign:** False positive fistula sign (nystagmus on tragal pressure) may be seen due to fibrous adhesions between the stapes footplate and the distended saccule.

#### 2. Tuning Fork Tests
*   **Rinne Test:** Positive (AC > BC).
*   **Weber Test:** Lateralizes to the **better (healthy)** ear.
*   **ABC Test:** Reduced on the affected side.
*   *Interpretation:* **[[Sensorineural Hearing Loss]]**.

### Investigations

#### 1. Audiometry
*   **[[Pure Tone Audiometry]] (PTA):**
    *   **Early Stage:** Low-frequency SNHL (Rising curve).
    *   **Late Stage:** Flat or falling curve (High frequencies also involved).
*   **Speech Audiometry:** Good discrimination score (55-85%), but impaired during attacks.
*   **Special Tests for Recruitment:**
    *   **SISI Test:** Score > 70% (Positive for cochlear pathology).
    *   **Tone Decay:** Negative (< 20 dB decay).

#### 2. Electrocochleography (ECochG)
*   *Most sensitive and diagnostic test.*
*   Measures the ratio of Summating Potential (SP) to Action Potential (AP).
*   **Normal:** SP/AP ratio < 30%.
*   **Meniere’s:** **SP/AP ratio > 30%** (some sources say > 45%).

#### 3. Glycerol Test (Dehydration Test)
*   **Procedure:** Patient ingests Glycerol (1.5g/kg). Audiogram/ECochG done before and 3 hours after.
*   **Positive Result:** Improvement in hearing threshold by >10-15 dB or speech discrimination scores. Glycerol (osmotic diuretic) reduces hydrops temporarily.

#### 4. Caloric Test
*   Shows **Canal Paresis** (reduced response) on the affected side in 75% of cases.

#### 5. Imaging (MRI)
*   **Gadolinium-enhanced [[MRI]]:** primarily used to **rule out [[Acoustic Neuroma]]** (Vestibular Schwannoma).
*   Recent techniques can visualize endolymphatic hydrops directly.

### Diagnosis (AAO-HNS Criteria)

| Category | Criteria |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Certain** | Definite disease + Histopathological confirmation (Post-mortem). |
| **Definite** | • Two or more spontaneous episodes of vertigo ($\ge$ 20 mins).<br>• Audiometrically documented hearing loss.<br>• Tinnitus or aural fullness.<br>• Other causes excluded. |
| **Probable** | • One definitive episode of vertigo.<br>• Documented hearing loss.<br>• Tinnitus or aural fullness. |
| **Possible** | • Episodic vertigo *without* documented hearing loss.<br>OR<br>• Sensorineural hearing loss (fluctuating/fixed) with disequilibrium but *without* definitive vertigo episodes. |

### Treatment

#### 1. General Measures (Lifestyle Modification)
*   **Diet:** Low salt diet (Sodium restriction causes water retention).
*   **Cessation:** Smoking (nicotine causes vasoconstriction), Alcohol, Caffeine.
*   **Stress reduction:** Reassurance.

#### 2. Medical Management
*   **Acute Attack:**
    *   **[[Labyrinthine sedatives]]:** Prochlorperazine (Stemetil), Promethazine, Diazepam.
*   **Chronic Phase (Maintenance):**
    *   **[[Vasodilators]]:** **Betahistine** (increases labyrinthine blood flow).
    *   **Diuretics:** Thiazides, Acetazolamide (reduce endolymphatic pressure).
    *   **Systemic Steroids:** For autoimmune/inflammatory etiology.

#### 3. Minimally Invasive Therapy (Intratympanic)
*   **Intratympanic [[Gentamicin]]:** "Chemical Labyrinthectomy." Used for intractable vertigo. Selectively destroys vestibular cells (vestibulotoxic) but risks hearing loss.
*   **Intratympanic Steroids:** Dexamethasone. Useful if autoimmune cause suspected; no risk to hearing.
*   **Meniett Device:** Delivers intermittent low-pressure pulses to the inner ear via a grommet to facilitate fluid exchange.

#### 4. Surgical Management
Indicated when medical treatment fails and vertigo is incapacitating.

| Procedure | Indications/Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[[Endolymphatic Sac Decompression]]** | • Conservative surgery (Hearing preserved).<br>• Drainage of sac into mastoid or subarachnoid space (Shunt). |
| **[[Vestibular Nerve Section]]** | • Vertigo control rate >90%.<br>• Preserves Hearing.<br>• Requires intracranial approach (Retrosigmoid/Middle fossa). |
| **[[Labyrinthectomy]]** | • **Destructive surgery.**<br>• Indicated only if **hearing is non-serviceable** (severe/profound loss).<br>• Totally destroys vestibular and cochlear function. |
