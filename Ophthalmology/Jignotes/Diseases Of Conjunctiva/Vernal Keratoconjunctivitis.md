# [[Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis]] (Spring Catarrh)

**Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis (VKC)** is a recurrent, bilateral, interstitial, self-limiting, allergic inflammation of the [[conjunctiva]] having a periodic seasonal incidence. It is a hypersensitivity reaction characterized by intense itching and specific conjunctival and corneal signs.

### Etiology and Epidemiology
*   **Hypersensitivity:** Primarily **Type I (IgE-mediated)** hypersensitivity. Recent evidence suggests **Type IV (cell-mediated)** mechanisms involving Th2 lymphocytes also play a role.
*   **Age:** Disease of childhood and adolescence. Onset typically between **4–20 years**. Usually resolves around puberty (self-limiting).
*   **Sex:** Marked male preponderance (**Boys > Girls**).
*   **Season:** More common in summer and spring (hence the name "Spring Catarrh").
*   **Climate:** Prevalent in hot, dry, and dusty climates (e.g., Tropics, Mediterranean).
*   **Associations:** often associated with history of [[atopy]], [[asthma]], or hay fever.

### Clinical Features

#### Symptoms
1.  **Intense Itching:** The hallmark symptom. It is usually intolerable.
2.  **Ropy Discharge:** Thick, stringy, white, mucoid discharge.
3.  **Photophobia:** Mild to severe (indicates corneal involvement).
4.  **Lacrimation:** Reflex watering.
5.  **Heaviness of lids:** Due to papillary hypertrophy.
6.  **Burning sensation**.

#### Clinical Classification and Signs
VKC presents in three clinical forms based on the location of involvement:

| Form | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Palpebral Form** | • Affects the **Upper Tarsal Conjunctiva**.<br>• **[[Cobblestone papillae]]**: Large, flat-topped, polygonal, raised areas separated by septa. <br>• Milky hue/bluish-white appearance due to thickened epithelium.<br>• **[[Giant papillae]]**: Hypertrophy causing cauliflower-like excrescences in severe cases. |
| **2. Bulbar/Limbal Form** | • Affects the **Bulbar Conjunctiva**.<br>• **[[Horner-Trantas dots]]**: Discrete, white, raised dots at the limbus composed of **[[eosinophils]]** and epithelial debris.<br>• Gelatinous, thickened, confluent membrane around the limbus.<br>• Dusky red triangular congestion. |
| **3. Mixed Form** | • Features of both Palpebral and Bulbar forms are present. |

**Specific Sign:**
*   **[[Maxwell-Lyon sign]]**: Presence of fibrin/eosinophils making the discharge ropy and stringy.

### Vernal Keratopathy (Corneal Involvement)
Corneal complications are potentially sight-threatening.
1.  **Punctate Epithelial Keratitis (PEK):** usually in the upper cornea.
2.  **[[Shield Ulcer]]**: A shallow, transverse/oval, sterile ulcer located in the superior cornea. It occurs due to epithelial macroerosions from the mechanical rubbing of giant papillae.
3.  **Vernal Corneal Plaques:** Coating of bare epithelial areas with altered exudates (mucus and fibrin).
4.  **Subepithelial Scarring:** Ring-shaped scar.
5.  **[[Pseudogerontoxon]]**: A paralimbal, grey-white band resembling [[arcus senilis]] but appearing in children ("Cupid's bow" outline).
6.  **[[Keratoconus]]**: High incidence due to chronic eye rubbing.

### Differential Diagnosis
*   **[[Trachoma]]**: Distinguished by follicles (VKC has papillae), scarring (Arlt's line), and pannus.
*   **[[Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis]] (AKC)**: Affects adults, involves lower tarsus, more chronic, associated with atopic dermatitis.
*   **[[Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis]] (GPC)**: History of contact lens wear or ocular prosthesis.

### Management
Treatment is usually symptomatic as the disease is self-limiting.

#### 1. General Measures
*   **Avoidance:** Avoid hot, humid atmospheres and known allergens.
*   **Cold Compresses:** Ice packs for soothing effect.
*   **Dark Goggles:** To prevent photophobia.
*   **Lid Hygiene:** For associated blepharitis.

#### 2. Medical Therapy
*   **Topical [[Mast Cell Stabilizers]]**: Mainstay for maintenance and prophylaxis.
    *   Examples: **[[Sodium cromoglycate]]** (2%), **[[Lodoxamide]]** (0.1%).
*   **Topical [[Antihistamines]]**:
    *   Examples: Azelastine, Epinastine.
*   **Dual Action Drugs (Antihistamine + Mast Cell Stabilizer)**:
    *   **[[Olopatadine]]** (0.1%) or **Ketotifen**: Very effective for itching.
*   **Topical [[Corticosteroids]]**:
    *   Used for **acute exacerbations** only.
    *   Use "Soft steroids" like **[[Fluorometholone]]** or **Loteprednol** to minimize risk of glaucoma.
    *   Frequent instillation initially, then tapered rapidly.
*   **Topical [[Immunomodulators]]**:
    *   **[[Cyclosporine]]** (0.05% - 2%) or **Tacrolimus**: Used as steroid-sparing agents in severe/refractory cases.
*   **Mucolytics**:
    *   **[[Acetylcysteine]]** (5-10% drops): Used to dissolve ropy discharge and treat plaques.
*   **Systemic Therapy**: Oral antihistamines for severe itching.

#### 3. Surgical/Interventional Treatment
*   **Supratarsal Steroid Injection**: For refractory cases.
*   **Superficial [[Keratectomy]]**: Surgical removal of large vernal plaques/shield ulcers to allow re-epithelialization.
*   **Amniotic Membrane Transplantation**: For non-healing shield ulcers.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Steroid Caution:** Long-term use of topical steroids in children can lead to **[[steroid-induced glaucoma]]** and **[[cataract]]**. Always monitor [[Intraocular pressure]] (IOP).
*   **Keratoconus Risk:** Monitor corneal topography in VKC patients as chronic rubbing can induce ectasia.

### Mnemonics
*   **VKC Features:** **C-H-I-L-D**
    *   **C**obblestone papillae
    *   **H**orner-Trantas dots
    *   **I**tching (Intense)
    *   **L**imbal thickening
    *   **D**ischarge (Ropy)

*   **Treatment Ladder:** **S-A-M-S**
    *   **S**upportive (Cold compress/Dark glasses)
    *   **A**nti-allergic (Olopatadine/Mast cell stabilizers)
    *   **M**ucolytics (Acetylcysteine)
    *   **S**teroids (Topical - only for acute flare-ups)
