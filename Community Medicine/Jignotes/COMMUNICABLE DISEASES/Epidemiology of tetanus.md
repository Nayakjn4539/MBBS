# Epidemiology of Tetanus

### **1. Problem Statement**
Tetanus is an acute, often fatal disease caused by an exotoxin produced by [[Clostridium tetani]]. It is characterized by generalized rigidity and convulsive spasms of skeletal muscles.
*   **Global Status:** Rare in developed countries; remains a "killer disease" in the developing world, particularly **Neonatal Tetanus (NT)**.
*   **Indian Status:** India was declared **Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus (MNT) Free** in August 2015.

### **2. Epidemiological Determinants (The Triad)**

#### **A. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** [[Clostridium tetani]].
    *   **Morphology:** Gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-bearing organism.
    *   **Appearance:** Terminal spores give it a **"drum-stick"** appearance,.
*   **Spores:**
    *   Highly resistant to boiling, phenol, and cresol.
    *   **Destruction:** Can be killed by **autoclaving at 120°C for 15-20 minutes** or gamma irradiation.
    *   Germinate under *anaerobic* conditions to produce toxin.
*   **Exotoxin ([[Tetanospasmin]]):**
    *   **Potency:** Second most lethal toxin known (after Botulinum). Lethal dose for a 70kg man is ~0.1 mg,.
    *   **Mechanism:** Blocks inhibition of spinal reflexes, leading to spasms.
    *   **Target:** Motor end plates, spinal cord, brain, and sympathetic system.
*   **Reservoir:**
    *   **Soil and Dust:** The natural habitat.
    *   **Intestine:** Found in the gut of herbivorous animals (cattle, horses) and humans.
*   **Communicability:** **None.** It is *not* transmitted from person to person,.

#### **B. Host Factors**
*   **Age:** Active age group (**5–40 years**) is most predisposed due to trauma risk. Newborns are at risk of **Neonatal Tetanus**.
*   **Sex:** Males > Females generally (due to outdoor exposure/trauma). However, females are at risk during delivery or abortion (**Puerperal Tetanus**).
*   **Occupation:** Agricultural workers are at high risk due to soil contact.
*   **Immunity:**
    *   **Herd Immunity:** **Does NOT protect the individual.** This is a unique feature of tetanus compared to other vaccine-preventable diseases,.
    *   **Post-infection Immunity:** Recovery from clinical tetanus does **not** confer natural immunity. Patients must be actively immunized after recovery.
    *   **Maternal Immunity:** Protective antibodies can be transferred to the fetus if the mother is immunized.

#### **C. Environmental Factors**
*   Tetanus is a positive environmental hazard. Occurrence depends on contact with soil/dust.
*   **Social Factors:** Unhygienic delivery practices (e.g., cutting umbilical cord with unsterile instruments, applying cow dung/ash to the stump).

### **3. Transmission and Incubation**

*   **Mode of Transmission:**
    *   Contamination of wounds with **tetanus spores**.
    *   **Entry points:** Trivial pin pricks, abrasions, puncture wounds, deep cuts, burns, animal bites, unsterile surgery, and ear infections (otogenic).
*   **Incubation Period (IP):**
    *   Usually **6–10 days**,.
    *   *Clinical Rule:* The shorter the incubation period, the worse the prognosis.

### **4. Clinical Types**
1.  **Traumatic:** Following injury.
2.  **Puerperal:** Following abortion or normal labor (uterus is a favorable anaerobic site).
3.  **Otogenic:** Due to foreign bodies in the ear (pencils, beads); common in children.
4.  **Idiopathic:** No definite history of injury.
5.  **Neonatal Tetanus:** Known as the **"8th Day Disease"** (symptoms typically appear around day 7),.

**Clinical Features:**
*   **Trismus:** Lockjaw (spasm of masseter muscles).
*   **Risus Sardonicus:** Spasm of facial muscles.
*   **Opisthotonos:** Arched back due to muscle spasms.

---

### **5. Prevention and Control**

**A. Active Immunization**
*   **Vaccine:** [[Tetanus Toxoid]] (TT).
*   **Goal:** Ensure antitoxin level of **0.01 IU/ml** serum,.
*   **Schedule (NIS):**
    *   **Pentavalent:** 6, 10, 14 weeks.
    *   **DPT Booster:** 16-24 months and 5-6 years.
    *   **TT/Td:** 10 years and 16 years.
    *   **Pregnant Women:** 2 doses of Td (1 month apart) or 1 booster if vaccinated in the last 3 years,.

**B. Passive Immunization**
*   **Human Tetanus Hyperimmunoglobulin (TIG):** Dose **250 IU**. Longer protection (30 days), no sensitivity reactions. *Preferred*.
*   **Equine Antitoxin (ATS):** Dose **1500 IU**. Risk of anaphylaxis (requires test dose). Protection lasts 7-10 days.

**C. Prevention of Tetanus After Injury (Wound Management)**
*Crucial for Exams:* Decisions are based on the nature of the wound and immunity status.

| Immunity Category | History of Immunization | Clean, Minor Wounds (< 6 hrs old) | All Other Wounds (Dirty/Old) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A** | Complete course/booster within **last 5 years** | Nothing required | Nothing required |
| **B** | Complete course/booster **> 5 years but < 10 years ago** | **Toxoid 1 dose** | **Toxoid 1 dose** |
| **C** | Complete course/booster **> 10 years ago** | **Toxoid 1 dose** | **Toxoid 1 dose** + **TIG** |
| **D** | **Unknown** or incomplete | **Toxoid complete course** | **Toxoid complete course** + **TIG** |

**D. Prevention of Neonatal Tetanus (The "Cleans")**
Strategies focus on clean delivery practices known as the **"5 Cleans"** (sometimes extended to 7 cleans),,.

**<u>Mnemonic: 3 C's and 2 H's</u>**
1.  **C**lean **C**ord Cut (New blade)
2.  **C**lean **C**ord Tie
3.  **C**lean **C**ord Stump (No application of cow dung/ash)
4.  **C**lean **H**ands (Attendant)
5.  **C**lean surface (**H**ome/Delivery surface)

*(Added in 7 cleans: Clean Water and Clean Towel)*.
