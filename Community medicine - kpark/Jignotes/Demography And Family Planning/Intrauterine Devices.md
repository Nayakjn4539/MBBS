# [[Demography And Family Planning]] > Intrauterine Devices

### Intrauterine Devices (Cu-T)

[[Intrauterine Devices]] (IUDs) are widely used spacing methods of contraception. The **Copper-T (Cu-T)** belongs to the **Second Generation** of IUDs (Bio-active/Medicated), which represented a significant improvement over the inert First Generation (Lippes Loop) by adding copper to enhance antifertility effects.

#### Classification of Copper Devices
The effectiveness is directly related to the surface area of copper (in sq. mm) on the device.
*   **Older Devices:** Copper-7, Copper T-200.
*   **Newer Devices:**
    *   **[[Cu-T 380A]]:** The most commonly used device in the National Family Welfare Programme. The 'A' stands for *Arms* (copper bands on horizontal arms) and '380' represents the surface area of copper.
    *   **Nova T:** Has a silver core.
    *   **Multiload Devices:** ML-Cu-250 and ML-Cu-375.

#### Mechanism of Action
The exact mechanism is complex, but the primary mode of action is the **prevention of fertilization**.
1.  **Foreign Body Reaction:** Causes cellular and biochemical changes in the endometrium and uterine fluids, impairing the viability of the gamete.
2.  **Copper Effect:** Copper ions enhance the cellular response, alter enzymes, and affect the biochemical composition of cervical mucus. This impairs **sperm motility**, capacitation, and survival.
3.  **Anti-implantation:** It renders the endometrium unfavorable for implantation, though this is secondary to fertilization prevention.

#### Effectiveness and Lifespan
*   **Lifespan:**
    *   [[Cu-T 380A]]: Approved for use for **10 years**.
    *   Cu-T 200: Approved for 4 years.
    *   Nova T: Approved for 5 years.
*   **Failure Rate:** The [[Pearl Index]] for Cu-T 380A is remarkably low, approximately **0.5 – 0.8 per 100 woman-years**.

#### Advantages
*   **Long-acting:** A single insertion provides protection for a decade (Cu-T 380A).
*   **Reversible:** Fertility returns promptly upon removal.
*   **Non-Hormonal:** Free from systemic metabolic side effects associated with [[Oral Contraceptive Pills]] (e.g., cardiovascular risks).
*   **Cost-effective:** Inexpensive and requires no daily motivation.
*   **Emergency Contraception:** Cu-T can be inserted within **5 days** of unprotected intercourse as a highly effective [[post-coital contraceptive]].

#### Ideal Candidate
According to the Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), the ideal candidate is a woman who:
1.  Has borne at least one child.
2.  Has no history of pelvic disease.
3.  Has normal menstrual periods.
4.  Is in a monogamous relationship.

#### Time of Insertion
*   **During Menstruation:** Ideally within the first 10 days of the cycle (cervical canal is dilated, making insertion easier).
*   **Post-Partum:**
    *   **Immediate:** Within 48 hours of delivery.
    *   **Post-puerperal:** 6–8 weeks after delivery (preferred to reduce expulsion risk).
*   **Post-Abortion:** Immediately after a first-trimester legal abortion.

#### Side Effects and Complications
*   **Bleeding:** The **most common** complaint and cause for removal. Includes heavier flow or mid-cycle spotting. Managed with reassurance and Iron-Folic Acid (IFA) supplements.
*   **Pain:** The second major side effect (backache or cramps).
*   **Pelvic Infection ([[Pelvic Inflammatory Disease]]):** Risk is highest in the first few weeks after insertion. Can lead to infertility.
*   **Expulsion:** Rate varies (5-15%); more common in nullipara or immediate post-partum insertion.
*   **Uterine Perforation:** Rare (<0.3%) but serious complication.
*   **Ectopic Pregnancy:** While IUDs prevent intrauterine pregnancy effectively, if a pregnancy *does* occur, the ratio of ectopic to intrauterine is higher than in non-users.

### Clinical Relevance: Mnemonics

**Mnemonic for Contraindications: "PREGNANCY"**
*   **P**regnancy (Suspected or confirmed)
*   **R**ecent history of PID
*   **E**ctopic pregnancy history (Absolute contraindication)
*   **G**enital tract malignancy (Ca Cervix/Uterus)
*   **N**ulliparity (Relative contraindication - better suited for smaller devices)
*   **A**naemia (Relative - due to bleeding risk)
*   **N**o motivation (Relative)
*   **C**ervical discharge (Purulent)
*   **Y**es, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding

**Mnemonic for Complications: "PAINS"**
*   **P**eriod late (Pregnancy?)
*   **A**bdominal pain (PID/Perforation?)
*   **I**nfection (Exposure to STIs?)
*   **N**ot feeling well (Fever/Chills - Sepsis?)
*   **S**tring missing (Expulsion/Perforation?)
