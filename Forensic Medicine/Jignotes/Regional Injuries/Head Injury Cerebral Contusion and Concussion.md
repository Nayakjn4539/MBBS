# Head Injury: Cerebral Contusion and Concussion

## 1. Cerebral Contusion (Bruise of the Brain)

### Definition
A [[cerebral contusion]] is a specific area of brain tissue destruction accompanied by extravasation of blood into the affected tissues due to the rupture of small blood vessels (capillaries and veins).
*   It is essentially a bruise of the brain.
*   **Key Feature:** The **[[pia-arachnoid]]** membrane usually remains intact over the lesion. If the pia-arachnoid is torn, it is termed a **[[cerebral laceration]]**.

### Common Sites
Contusions occur most frequently where the brain comes in contact with irregular bony protuberances of the skull base.
*   **Frontal lobes:** Orbital surfaces (orbital plates).
*   **Temporal lobes:** Tips and poles (sphenoidal ridges).
*   **Less common:** Occipital lobes and cerebellum.

### Mechanism and Classification
Contusions are classified based on the mechanism of injury and location relative to the impact:

1.  **Coup Contusion:**
    *   Occurs at the **site of impact**.
    *   Caused by the in-bending of the skull bone slapping the underlying brain.
    *   Common when a moving object strikes a stationary head (e.g., hammer blow),.
    *   **Appearance:** Wedge-shaped with base at the pial surface and apex pointing inward.

2.  **Contrecoup Contusion:**
    *   Occurs **diametrically opposite** to the site of impact.
    *   Caused by the moving brain hitting the unyielding skull on the opposite side during deceleration.
    *   Common when a moving head strikes a stationary object (e.g., fall on the back of the head causing frontal contusions),.
    *   **Rule of Thumb:** In falls (moving head), contrecoup injuries are more severe than coup injuries.

3.  **Fracture Contusion:**
    *   Occurs directly beneath a fracture site due to bone deformation or indriven bone fragments.

4.  **Herniation Contusion:**
    *   Occurs when the brain is forced against the rigid edges of the dura (e.g., [[tentorium cerebelli]]) due to raised intracranial pressure.
    *   Example: Grooving of the uncus (medial temporal lobe).

5.  **Gliding Contusion:**
    *   Focal hemorrhages in the parasagittal white matter due to shear strains during rotational acceleration.

### Autopsy Findings
*   **Gross Appearance:**
    *   **Fresh:** Swollen, dark red or purple area of hemorrhage. There is often overlying subarachnoid hemorrhage.
    *   **Shape:** On cross-section, they are typically **wedge-shaped** with the base towards the surface and apex pointing into the white matter.
    *   **Perilesional Edema:** The surrounding white matter may show edema.
*   **Old Contusions (Healing):**
    *   The necrotic tissue is removed by macrophages.
    *   **[[Plaque Jaune]]**: A depressed, yellowish-brown, gliotic scar formed due to hemosiderin deposition. This is a hallmark of old trauma,.

## 2. Cerebral Concussion (Commotio Cerebri)

### Definition
[[Cerebral concussion]] is a clinical syndrome characterized by immediate and transient impairment of neural function (such as alteration of consciousness, disturbance of vision, or equilibrium) due to mechanical force.
*   It is a **functional** disorder with no gross structural damage to the brain.

### Pathophysiology
*   **Theory:** The most accepted hypothesis is **Diffuse Neuronal Injury**.
*   **Mechanism:** Rotational acceleration/deceleration forces cause shear strain on the nerve fibers, particularly affecting the **[[Reticular Activating System]] (RAS)** in the brainstem, which regulates wakefulness.
*   There may be temporary synaptic disconnection or mitochondrial ATP depletion.

### Clinical Features
The onset is immediate following trauma.
1.  **Unconsciousness:** Immediate loss of consciousness (paralytic coma) lasting from seconds to minutes (rarely hours).
2.  **Autonomic Disturbance:** Pallor, shallow respiration, weak/slow pulse (bradycardia), hypotension, and drop in temperature.
3.  **Muscle Tone:** Generalized flaccidity and loss of reflexes.
4.  **Recovery:** Usually complete. The patient may vomit upon regaining consciousness.
5.  **Amnesia:**
    *   **[[Retrograde Amnesia]]:** Loss of memory for events *immediately preceding* the injury.
    *   **Antegrade (Post-traumatic) Amnesia:** Inability to form new memories for a period *after* the injury.

### Autopsy Findings
*   **Gross:** Usually **negative/normal**. No visible injury to the brain.
*   **Microscopic:** Occasionally, petechial hemorrhages may be seen in the reticular substance or white matter. Chromatolysis of neurons may be seen in severe cases.

### Post-Concussion Syndrome
A sequela seen in some patients after recovery, characterized by:
*   Headache, dizziness, irritability.
*   Insomnia, lack of concentration.
*   Personality changes.

## 3. Comparison: Concussion vs. Drunkenness

Since alcohol intoxication can mimic head injury signs, differentiation is vital in medicolegal practice.

| Feature | Cerebral Concussion | Alcoholic Intoxication (Drunkenness) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **History** | Trauma/Injury | Consumption of alcohol |
| **Skin/Face** | Pale, cold, clammy | Flushed, suffused, warm |
| **Pulse** | Slow and feeble | Fast and bounding |
| **Respiration** | Shallow, irregular, slow | Deep, sighing, smell of alcohol |
| **Pupils** | Dilated/unequal, sluggish reaction | Dilated, sluggish (MacEwen's sign) |
| **Memory** | **Retrograde amnesia** present | Confused, no retrograde amnesia |
| **Behavior** | Quiet, cooperative upon waking | Abusive, uncooperative, slurred speech |
| **Reaction to Stimuli** | Unresponsive (in coma) | Often responds to painful stimuli (pinching) |
| **Temperature** | Subnormal | Subnormal |,

## 4. Medicolegal Aspects

### Cerebral Contusion
*   **Nature of Violence:** Indicates blunt force trauma.
*   **Age of Injury:** Can be estimated by color changes (similar to bruises) and histology (plaque jaune indicates old injury).
*   **Intoxication:** Alcoholics are prone to unduly large contusions due to blunted protective reflexes and coagulation defects.
*   **Coup vs. Contrecoup:** Helps reconstruct the crime scene (e.g., identifying if the victim was struck by a weapon or fell onto the ground).

### Cerebral Concussion
*   **Cause of Death:** Pure concussion is rarely fatal. If death occurs, it is usually due to associated injuries or complications.
*   **Lucid Interval:** Though classic for Extradural Hemorrhage, a form of lucid interval can be seen in concussion where the patient recovers consciousness and then deteriorates due to developing intracranial hemorrhage.
*   **Interrogation:** Police should delay interrogating a concussed person due to mental confusion and amnesia; statements made may be invalid or inadmissible.
*   **Automatism:** Rarely, a concussed person may perform automatic complex acts (post-traumatic automatism) without memory, which can be a defense for crimes committed during this state.

### Mnemonic for Concussion Signs
**"SCALP"**
*   **S** - Skin pale/cold
*   **C** - Consciousness lost (Immediate)
*   **A** - Amnesia (Retrograde)
*   **L** - Limp muscles (Flaccid)
*   **P** - Pulse slow/feeble
