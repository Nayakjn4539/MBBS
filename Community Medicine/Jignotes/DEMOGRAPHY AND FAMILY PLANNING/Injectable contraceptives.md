# [[DEMOGRAPHY AND FAMILY PLANNING]] > Injectable contraceptives

### Injectable Contraceptives (Depot Formulations)

**Injectable contraceptives** are long-acting, reversible hormonal contraceptives that provide protection against pregnancy for several months following a single injection. They are highly effective [[spacing methods]] suitable for women who desire privacy or cannot take daily pills.

### Classification

They are broadly classified into two types:
1.  **Progestogen-only Injectables** (Most common)
2.  **Combined Injectable Contraceptives** (contain Estrogen + Progestogen)

---

### 1. Progestogen-only Injectables

 These are the most widely used injectable contraceptives in national family planning programs.

#### A. DMPA (Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate)
*   **Brand Names:** [[Depo-Provera]], **Antara** (Govt. of India supply).
*   **Dose:** **150 mg**.
*   **Route:** Deep Intramuscular (IM) injection (Gluteal or Deltoid muscle).
*   **Schedule:** Given every **3 months** (90 days).
    *   *Grace period:* Can be given 2 weeks early or up to 4 weeks late.
*   **Efficacy:** Highly effective (Failure rate: ~0.3 per 100 women-years).

#### B. NET-EN (Norethisterone Enanthate)
*   **Brand Name:** Noristerat.
*   **Dose:** **200 mg**.
*   **Route:** Deep Intramuscular (IM).
*   **Schedule:** Given every **2 months** (60 days).

#### C. DMPA-SC (Subcutaneous)
*   **Dose:** **104 mg**.
*   **Route:** Subcutaneous (thigh or abdomen).
*   **Schedule:** Every 3 months.
*   **Advantage:** Lower dose, potential for self-injection.

### 2. Combined Injectable Contraceptives (CIC)
*   Contains both Progestogen and Estrogen.
*   **Schedule:** Given **Monthly**.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Cyclofem:** Medroxyprogesterone acetate (25 mg) + Estradiol cypionate (5 mg).
    *   **Mesigyna:** Norethisterone enanthate (50 mg) + Estradiol valerate (5 mg).
*   **Advantage:** Better bleeding regularity compared to progestogen-only injectables.

### Mechanism of Action
The primary mechanism is the suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis.

1.  **Inhibition of Ovulation:** Prevents the release of the egg (Primary mechanism).
2.  **Thickening of Cervical Mucus:** Creates a barrier preventing sperm penetration.
3.  **Endometrial Atrophy:** Makes the lining of the uterus thin and unfavorable for implantation.

---

### Advantages
*   **Highly Effective:** Comparable to sterilization but reversible.
*   **Convenience:** No daily pill-taking; requires only 4 visits a year (for DMPA).
*   **Privacy:** It is discrete; no one else needs to know.
*   **Lactation:** Does **not** suppress lactation (Safe for breastfeeding mothers after 6 weeks).
*   **Non-contraceptive Benefits:**
    *   Reduces menstrual blood loss (helps in [[Anaemia]]).
    *   Protects against Endometrial and Ovarian cancer.
    *   Protects against Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID).
    *   Can reduce crises in Sickle Cell Disease.

### Disadvantages and Side Effects
The side effects are mainly menstrual and metabolic.

*   **Menstrual Disturbances (Most Common):**
    *   Irregular spotting/bleeding (common in first few months).
    *   **Amenorrhea:** Cessation of periods is very common after 1 year of use (approx 50-80% users).
*   **Weight Gain:** Due to anabolic effect and fluid retention.
*   **Bone Mineral Density:** Minor, reversible decrease in bone density with long-term use.
*   **Return of Fertility:** There is a **delay in return of fertility** (approx. 4–8 months) after stopping the injections. It causes temporary infertility, not permanent.

> *   **E** - **E**xpansion of weight (Weight gain)
> *   **P** - **P**ause in fertility return (Delayed return)
> *   **O** - **O**steopenia (Bone density reduction - reversible)

### Clinical Relevance & Administration Tips
1.  **Timing:** Ideally given within the **first 7 days** of the menstrual cycle (to ensure non-pregnant status).
2.  **Technique:** Shake the vial vigorously before use (it is a suspension).
3.  **Crucial Step:** **DO NOT MASSAGE** the injection site after administration. Massaging accelerates absorption and reduces the duration of action.
4.  **Counseling:** Patients must be counseled about **amenorrhea** (stopping of periods) so they do not confuse it with pregnancy or accumulation of "bad blood".
