# [[Diseases Of Cornea]] > Interstitial Keratitis

### Interstitial Keratitis

**Interstitial Keratitis (IK)** is a chronic, non-ulcerative, non-suppurative inflammation affecting chiefly the [[corneal stroma]] without primary involvement of the epithelium or endothelium. It is often associated with uveitis.

---

### Etiology and Classification

The inflammation is usually an immunologic response (antigen-antibody complex or delayed hypersensitivity) rather than direct infection, although direct invasion can occur.

**Common Causes:**
*   **Bacterial:**
    *   [[Congenital syphilis]] (Most common cause, ~90%).
    *   [[Tuberculosis]].
    *   [[Leprosy]].
    *   Lyme disease.
*   **Viral:**
    *   [[Herpes Simplex Virus]] (HSV).
    *   Herpes Zoster.
    *   Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), Mumps, Measles.
*   **Syndromic:**
    *   [[Cogan's syndrome]] (Interstitial keratitis + Vestibular deafness + Tinnitus/Vertigo).
*   **Others:**
    *   Sarcoidosis, Onchocerciasis.

### Syphilitic (Luetic) Interstitial Keratitis

This is the classical form of the disease. It is usually bilateral and manifests typically between ages 5 and 15 years.

**Pathogenesis:**
*   It is a manifestation of a local **antigen-antibody reaction**.
*   *Treponema pallidum* invades the cornea during the fetal stage and sensitizes it. Later in life, a trigger (trauma/infection) excites inflammation in this sensitized tissue.

**Clinical Features:**
It is often part of **Hutchinson's Triad**:
1.  [[Interstitial Keratitis]].
2.  [[Hutchinson's teeth]] (Peg-shaped incisors).
3.  [[Vestibular deafness]].

**Clinical Stages:**

| Stage | Clinical Findings | Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Progressive Stage (Infiltration)** | • Edema of endothelium and deep stroma.<br>• Ground-glass appearance of cornea.<br>• **[[Keratic precipitates]] (KPs)** on endothelium.<br>• Pain, lacrimation, photophobia, circumcorneal injection. | ~2 weeks |
| **2. Florid Stage (Vascularization)** | • **[[Salmon Patch appearance]]**: Deep vascularization characterized by radial bundles of brush-like vessels. Due to the hazy cornea covering them, they appear dull reddish-pink.<br>• **Epaulet**: Heaping of conjunctiva and vessels at the limbus.<br>• Eye is acutely inflamed. | ~2 months |
| **3. Stage of Regression** | • Inflammation resolves.<br>• Clearing of cornea starts from periphery to center.<br>• Vessels empty and persist as **[[Ghost vessels]]** (fine, opaque lines).<br>• Residual corneal opacities may remain. | 1–2 years |

**Clinical Implications:**
*   **Ghost Vessels:** These persist permanently and are a diagnostic sign of past interstitial keratitis. They are non-perfused deep vessels.
*   **Uveitis:** Deep inflammation almost always involves the anterior uvea. IK is fundamentally a uveitis where the keratitis masks the underlying iridocyclitis.

### Tuberculous Interstitial Keratitis

Differentiating features from Syphilitic IK:
*   **Laterality:** More frequently unilateral.
*   **Location:** Usually sectorial, typically involving the **lower sector** of the cornea.
*   **Course:** Similar to syphilitic but response to treatment differs.

---

### Diagnosis

*   **Clinical:** Based on signs like ground-glass cornea, salmon patch, or ghost vessels.
*   **Serology:**
    *   **Syphilis:** VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) and TPI (Treponema Pallidum Immobilization) tests. FTA-ABS is more specific.
    *   **Tuberculosis:** Mantoux test, Chest X-ray.
    *   **Cogan's:** Audiometry for deafness.

### Treatment

The goal is to control inflammation and prevent scarring.

**1. Local Therapy:**
*   **Topical [[Corticosteroids]]:** (e.g., Dexamethasone 0.1%). Mainstay of treatment. Reduces inflammation and scarring; effective because the condition is allergic/immune-mediated.
*   **[[Cycloplegics]]:** (e.g., Atropine 1% ointment). To rest the ciliary body, prevent posterior synechiae, and relieve pain from associated iridocyclitis.
*   **Dark Goggles:** For photophobia.

**2. Systemic Therapy:**
*   **Syphilitic:** Systemic Penicillin (or other antisyphilitic drugs) to treat the systemic infection and prevent other lesions (e.g., neurosyphilis). *Note: Systemic antibiotics may not prevent or shorten the course of the keratitis itself as it is immune-mediated*.
*   **Tuberculous:** Systemic Antitubercular Therapy (ATT).
*   **Cogan's Syndrome:** Systemic steroids may be required for hearing loss and keratitis.

**3. Surgical Therapy:**
*   **[[Keratoplasty]]:** Penetrating keratoplasty (corneal transplantation) is indicated if dense corneal opacities persist and significantly impair vision. Prognosis is generally good.
