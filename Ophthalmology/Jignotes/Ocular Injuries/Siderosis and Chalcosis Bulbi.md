# Siderosis and Chalcosis Bulbi

When an **[[Intraocular Foreign Body]] (IOFB)** is retained within the eye, the tissue reaction depends largely on the chemical nature of the foreign body. While inert substances (glass, plastic, gold) may cause no reaction, metallic foreign bodies undergo specific chemical reactions causing ocular toxicity.

## 1. Siderosis Bulbi (Iron Toxicity)

**Definition:** [[Siderosis Bulbi]] refers to the degenerative changes produced by an iron or steel foreign body retained inside the eyeball.

### Pathophysiology
*   **Dissociation:** The iron particle undergoes **electrolytic dissociation** by the current of rest.
*   **Dissemination:** The iron ions disseminate throughout the eye.
*   **Cellular Damage:** These ions combine with **intracellular proteins** (specifically in epithelial structures) producing **degenerative changes** (This is the key difference from chalcosis).
*   **Target Tissues:** Epithelial structures of the eye are most affected (Lens epithelium, Iris, Retina, Trabecular meshwork).
*   **Timeline:** Usually occurs **2 months to 2 years** after injury, though earliest changes have been reported after 9 days.

### Clinical Features
**1. Lens (Cataract)**
*   **Rust Ring:** Rusty or orangish deposits arranged radially in a ring in the **anterior capsule** and anterior epithelium of the lens.
*   **Cataract:** Eventually, the lens becomes completely cataractous.

**2. Iris (Heterochromia)**
*   **Discoloration:** The iris is first stained greenish and later turns **reddish-brown**.
*   **[[Heterochromia Iridis]]:** This leads to hyperpigmentation of the affected eye (unlike Fuch’s uveitis where the affected eye is hypochromic).

**3. Retina**
*   **Pigmentary Degeneration:** The retina develops pigmentary degeneration resembling **[[Retinitis Pigmentosa]]**.
*   **Vascular Changes:** There may be sclerosis of retinal vessels.

**4. Glaucoma**
*   **Secondary Open-Angle Glaucoma:** Occurs due to degenerative changes and iron deposition in the **trabecular meshwork**.

### Diagnosis
*   **[[Electroretinography]] (ERG):** Shows progressive **attenuation of the b-wave** over time. This indicates retinal toxicity.
*   **Staining:** **Prussian Blue reaction** is used to stain iron deposits.

## 2. Chalcosis Bulbi (Copper Toxicity)

**Definition:** [[Chalcosis]] refers to specific ocular changes produced by a **copper alloy** (e.g., brass or bronze) foreign body.

> **Clinical Note:** **Pure copper** causes a violent **suppurative reaction** (endophthalmitis/panophthalmitis) leading to shrinkage of the globe. Only copper **alloys** (<85% copper) cause Chalcosis.

### Pathophysiology
*   **Dissociation:** Copper ions from the alloy dissociate electrolytically.
*   **Deposition:** Ions are deposited **under membranous structures** of the eye (Descemet's membrane, lens capsule, internal limiting membrane).
*   **Lack of Degeneration:** Unlike iron, copper ions **do not** enter into chemical combination with intracellular proteins; hence, they generally **do not produce degenerative changes**.

### Clinical Features
**1. Cornea**
*   **[[Kayser-Fleischer Ring]] (K-F Ring):** A golden-brown ring formed due to deposition of copper in the peripheral parts of **Descemet’s membrane**.
*   *Note:* This is clinically identical to the ring seen in [[Wilson's Disease]] (Hepatolenticular degeneration).

**2. Lens**
*   **[[Sunflower Cataract]]:** Deposition of copper under the **posterior capsule** of the lens.
*   **Appearance:** It appears brilliant golden-green and is arranged like the petals of a sunflower.

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a Sunflower Cataract showing petal-like opacities radiating from the center, typically green/golden in color

**3. Retina**
*   **Golden Plaques:** Deposition of golden plaques at the **posterior pole** which reflect light with a metallic sheen.

## Comparison: Siderosis vs. Chalcosis

| Feature | Siderosis Bulbi (Iron) | Chalcosis Bulbi (Copper Alloy) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Material** | Iron / Steel | Copper Alloy (Brass/Bronze) |
| **Reaction Type** | **Degenerative** (Binds to proteins) | **Deposition** (Under membranes) |
| **Purity Effect** | Toxicity increases with iron content | **Pure Copper** causes **Suppuration** (Pus) |
| **Cornea** | Usually clear (unless blood stained) | **Kayser-Fleischer Ring** (Descemet's membrane) |
| **Iris** | **Heterochromia** (Hyperchromic/Rusty) | Usually normal |
| **Lens** | Rusty ring (Anterior Capsule) | **Sunflower Cataract** (Posterior Capsule) |
| **Retina** | Pigmentary degeneration (Like RP) | **Golden Plaques** at posterior pole |
| **ERG** | **b-wave attenuation** (diagnostic) | usually normal initially |
| **Glaucoma** | Common (Trabecular damage) | Rare |

## Clinical Management of Retained IOFB

1.  **Diagnosis:**
    *   **History:** Mode of injury (chisel and hammer is common for iron).
    *   **Examination:** Slit-lamp for entry wound, iris hole, or cataract. Gonioscopy for FB in angle.
    *   **Imaging:**
        *   **CT Scan (Orbit):** **Investigation of Choice** for localization.
        *   **X-Ray:** Can detect radio-opaque FB.
        *   **MRI:** **Contraindicated** if metallic FB is suspected (movement can cause damage).
2.  **Treatment:**
    *   **Inorganic/Inert (Glass/Plastic):** May be left alone if not causing visual obscuration or reaction.
    *   **Toxic (Iron/Copper):** **Must be removed.**
        *   **Magnetic FB:** Removed via external magnet or Pars Plana Vitrectomy (PPV) with intraocular magnet.
        *   **Non-Magnetic FB (Copper):** Removed via Pars Plana Vitrectomy (PPV) using forceps.
