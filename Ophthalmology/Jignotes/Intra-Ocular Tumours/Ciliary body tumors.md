# [[Intra-Ocular Tumours]] > Ciliary body tumors

### Classification of Ciliary Body Tumours

Tumours of the [[ciliary body]] can be broadly classified based on their nature (benign or malignant) and origin.

| Category | Tumor Type |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Benign** | • Hyperplasia<br>• Benign cyst<br>• [[Medulloepithelioma]] (Diktyoma) |
| **Malignant** | • [[Malignant Melanoma]] |

### Benign Tumours

#### 1. Hyperplasia and Benign Cysts
These are generally insignificant lesions of the ciliary body.

#### 2. [[Medulloepithelioma]] (Diktyoma)
*   **Origin:** It is a rare congenital tumour arising from the **non-pigmented epithelium** of the ciliary body.
*   **Age of Presentation:** Typically presents in the **first decade** of life.
*   **Nature:** Although generally benign, malignant variants exist. It locally invades tissues but rarely metastasizes.

### [[Malignant Melanoma]] of the Ciliary Body

This is the most significant tumour of the ciliary body. While less common than choroidal melanoma, it is often diagnosed late due to its hidden location behind the iris, leading to a worse prognosis.

#### Clinical Features
The clinical presentation depends on the direction of tumor growth and its effect on adjacent structures.

**1. Early Signs**
*   **Hypotony:** Slight lowering of intraocular pressure may be an early sign.
*   **Sentinel Vessels:** One or more dilated, tortuous episcleral veins seen in the quadrant containing the tumour. This is a highly suspicious sign indicating impeded ciliary circulation.
*   **Vision:** Unaccountable defective vision or refractive changes due to pressure on the lens.

**2. Anterior Extension (Spreading forward)**
*   **Lens Changes:** Pressure on the lens equator causes anterior displacement, [[subluxation of lens]], and localized [[cataract]] formation.
*   **Iris Involvement:**
    *   The tumour may become visible at the root of the iris.
    *   **Iridodialysis Mimicry:** It may present as a dark crescent at the iris root resembling an [[iridodialysis]].
    *   **Differentiation:** A tumour is opaque to transillumination and shows **no red reflex**, whereas a traumatic iridodialysis allows a red reflex through the gap.
*   **Secondary Glaucoma:** Involvement of the [[angle of anterior chamber]] leads to secondary [[glaucoma]].
*   **Epibulbar Mass:** The tumour may extend through the sclera along perivascular spaces (emissaria) to present as a dark mass on the eye surface.

**3. Posterior Extension (Spreading backward)**
*   Involvement of the [[choroid]].
*   Presentation as an **exudative [[retinal detachment]]**.

**4. Circumferential Spread**
*   **Ring Melanoma:** The tumour may grow circumferentially, infiltrating the entire ciliary body ring. This form has a poor prognosis.

#### Diagnosis
*   **Slit Lamp Examination:** To visualize sentinel vessels or iris root involvement.
*   **Gonioscopy:** Essential to view the tumour in the angle of the anterior chamber.
*   **Transillumination:** The tumour is opaque to light.
*   **Ultrasound Biomicroscopy (UBM):** High-resolution imaging for anterior segment tumors to assess extent and depth.

#### Treatment
Management depends on the size and extent of the tumour.

1.  **Local Resection:**
    *   **Indications:** Small, localized tumours detected early.
    *   **Procedures:**
        *   **Iridocyclectomy:** Removal of the iris and ciliary body containing the tumour.
        *   **Cyclectomy:** Removal of a portion of the ciliary body.
2.  **[[Enucleation]]:**
    *   **Indications:** Large tumours extending anteriorly, posteriorly, or circumferentially (Ring melanoma).
    *   Required when the tumour is associated with [[secondary glaucoma]].

#### Prognosis
The prognosis for ciliary body melanoma is generally worse than for choroidal melanoma due to delayed diagnosis and the propensity for circumferential spread.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Diagnostic Challenge:** Because the ciliary body is hidden behind the iris, tumours here can grow significantly before causing symptoms. Always examine the ciliary body region (using gonioscopy and full dilation) in cases of unexplained unilateral cataract, subluxation, or glaucoma.
*   **Sentinel Vessels:** The presence of dilated episcleral vessels in a quiet eye (without inflammation) should always raise suspicion of an underlying ciliary body neoplasm.
*   **Differentiation from Trauma:** A dark crescent at the limbus without a history of trauma is likely a tumour, not an iridodialysis. Confirm with retro-illumination (tumour blocks light; dialysis passes light).
