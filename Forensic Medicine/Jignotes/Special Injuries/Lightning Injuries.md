# [[Special Injuries]] > Lightning Injuries

### Lightning Injuries

**Lightning** is a massive, natural electrical discharge from the atmosphere to the earth. It involves [[High Voltage Direct Current]] (DC), often exceeding 1,000 million volts and 20,000 to 100,000 amperes, acting for a very short duration (1/1000 to 1/10,000 of a second).

The study of medical aspects of lightning is known as **[[Keraunomedicine]]**.

### Mechanisms of Injury
A person can be struck by lightning in four primary ways:
1.  **Direct Strike:** The main bolt hits the victim directly (often the head). This is the most fatal type.
2.  **Side Flash (Splash):** The lightning strikes an object (like a tree) and jumps (arches) to a nearby victim who offers a path of lower resistance.
3.  **Contact Strike:** The victim is touching a conductor (e.g., a metal fence or plumbing) that is struck by lightning.
4.  **Step Voltage (Ground Current):** The bolt strikes the ground, and the current spreads radially. If a person has their feet apart, a potential difference is created between the feet, causing current to enter one foot and exit the other.

### Autopsy Findings

#### A. External Findings
**1. Burns (Electro-thermal injuries)**
These differ from standard high-voltage electrical burns.
*   **[[Lichtenberg flowers]] (Arborescent markings/Filigree burns/Feathering):** 
    *   **Pathognomonic** sign of lightning strike.
    *   **Appearance:** Superficial, thin, irregular, tortuous, fern-like or dendritic red marks on the skin.
    *   **Mechanism:** Vasoparalysis and hemolysis of RBCs in superficial capillaries due to the electromagnetic field, or electron showers tracking skin moisture.
    *   **Evolution:** They are *not* true burns. They fade within 24–48 hours in survivors (unlike marbling which increases).
    *   **Site:** Shoulders, flanks, and thighs.

*   **Linear Burns:** Seen in moist creases (axilla, groin) where sweat turns to steam.
*   **Punctate Burns:** Multiple small, circular, full-thickness burns (tip-toe signs), often seen where current exits through soles.
*   **Surface Burns:** Caused by heated metallic objects worn by the victim (chains, zippers).

| Feature | [[Filigree Burns]] (Lightning) | [[Marbling]] (Decomposition) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cause** | Electrical discharge/vasoparalysis | Decomposition (bacterial spread) |
| **Pattern** | Fern-like/Branching tree | Reticular/Net-like (vein pattern) |
| **Color** | Red or Pink | Greenish-black or reddish-purple |
| **Vessels** | Does not strictly follow vessels | Follows the anatomical course of veins |
| **Progression** | Fades in 1–2 days | Increases with time |

**2. Mechanical Injuries (Blast Effect)**
*   The rapidly expanding heated air creates a **shock wave** causing a "sledgehammer blow."
*   **Clothing:** Clothes may be torn off, shredded, or stripped completely. This is often mistaken for sexual assault. Shoes may burst open due to steam generation from sweat.
*   **Fractures:** Skull fractures, spinal fractures, and long bone fractures due to the violent muscular contraction or being thrown by the blast wave.
*   **Tympanic Membrane:** Rupture is very common (uni- or bilateral) due to the pressure wave.

**3. Metallic Signs**
*   **Magnetization:** Ferrous metals (keys, watches, belt buckles) carried by the victim may become magnetized. This can be tested using a compass or iron filings.
*   **Fusion:** Metallic objects may melt or fuse.

#### B. Internal Findings
*   **Brain:** Congestion, petechial hemorrhages, basal ganglia hemorrhage, chromatolysis of axons. [[Epidural hematoma]] or subdural hematoma may occur due to trauma.
*   **Lungs:** Congestion, edema, lung contusions (blast lung).
*   **Heart:** Subepicardial/subendocardial petechiae, myocardial infarction/contusion.
*   **Eyes:** Cataract formation (late sequelae in survivors).

### Cause of Death
1.  **Immediate:** [[Cardiac Asystole]] or Ventricular Fibrillation (primary cause).
2.  **Delayed:** Paralysis of the respiratory center (Medulla). While the heart may restart due to its automaticity, the respiratory center remains paralyzed for a longer duration, leading to secondary hypoxic cardiac arrest.
3.  **Blast Injuries:** Severe mechanical trauma.

### Medicolegal Aspects
1.  **Manner of Death:** Almost always **Accidental** (Act of God).
2.  **Suspicion of Homicide:**
    *   A body found in an open field with torn clothes and blunt trauma (fractures/bruises) may be mistaken for a victim of sexual assault and homicide.
    *   **Differentiation:** Look for singing of hair, fusing of synthetic clothes, magnetization of metal, and arborescent markings.
3.  **Location:** Common in open fields, under tall trees, or near water bodies.
4.  **Survivability:** Victims of lightning strike often appear dead (suspended animation) but can be resuscitated with prolonged CPR ("Resuscitate the dead").
