# [[Sexual Jurisprudence]] > Incest

### Definition
**Incest** is defined as sexual intercourse between two persons who are related to each other within the **prohibited degrees of relationship** (consanguinity or affinity), such that marriage between them is legally forbidden by law or custom.

*   **Consanguinity:** Related by blood (e.g., father-daughter, brother-sister).
*   **Affinity:** Related by marriage (e.g., father-in-law and daughter-in-law).

> **Note:** The definition of "prohibited degree" varies depending on the personal laws (Hindu/Muslim/Christian) applicable to the individuals.

### Types and Complexes
Incestuous relationships are often described using specific psychological or mythological terms based on the participants involved.

| Complex Name | Relationship Involved | Origin/Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Oedipus Complex]]** | Mother and Son | Greek mythology: Oedipus killed his father and married his mother. |
| **[[Electra Complex]]** | Father and Daughter | Greek mythology: Electra plotted to kill her mother to possess her father. |
| **[[Pharaoh Complex]]** | Brother and Sister | Sibling incest (Common in ancient Egyptian royalty to preserve bloodlines). |

*   **Nuclear Incest:** Occurs between members of the immediate family (Parent-child, siblings).
*   **Complex Incest:** Involves extended family members (Uncle-niece, Step-relations).

### Legal Status in India
Unlike many Western countries, **Incest per se is NOT a specific criminal offence** under the [[Indian Penal Code]] (IPC) or the new **Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS)**, provided it is consensual and between adults. However, it becomes a crime under specific circumstances:

1.  **Non-Consensual (Rape):** If the act is committed against the will or without consent of the woman, it is punishable as **[[Rape]]** (Sec 376 IPC / Sec 64 BNS).
2.  **Minors involved:** If the victim is a child (under 18 years), it is a grave offence punishable under the **[[POCSO Act]]** (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act).
3.  **Void Marriage:** Under the **Hindu Marriage Act, 1955**, marriage between persons within prohibited degrees of relationship is void, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits such a marriage.
4.  **Adultery:** If one or both parties are married, it may have civil consequences (grounds for divorce) though adultery is no longer a criminal offence.

### Medical and Genetic Implications
From a medical perspective, incest (specifically consanguineous) is discouraged due to **genetic risks**:
*   **Inbreeding Depression:** Increased probability of expression of **autosomal recessive disorders**.
*   Higher risk of congenital anomalies, mental retardation, and infant mortality in offspring produced from such unions.

### Medicolegal Aspects and Duties of Doctor

**1. Medical Termination of Pregnancy ([[MTP Act]]):**
*   Pregnancy resulting from rape or incest is considered a valid indication for **termination of pregnancy**.
*   It falls under the **"Humanitarian Grounds"** clause of the MTP Act (pregnancy caused by rape).
*   Even if the sexual act was consensual (e.g., between adult siblings), the anguish caused by a pregnancy from a prohibited relationship constitutes a grave injury to the mental health of the woman, justifying MTP.

**2. Nullity of Marriage:**
*   Medical evidence may be required to prove the biological relationship (DNA Profiling) in civil courts to declare a marriage null and void.

**3. Examination of Victim/Accused:**
*   The protocol is identical to that of **[[Sexual Assault]]/Rape examination**.
*   **History:** Specific questions regarding the relationship with the alleged perpetrator must be asked.
*   **Sample Collection:**
    *   **[[DNA Fingerprinting]]** is the gold standard.
    *   Samples from the fetus (if pregnant) can definitively establish paternity and confirm the incestuous nature of the relationship.

### Mnemonics for Complexes
To remember who is involved in which complex:

*   **M**other + **S**on = **O**edipus (**MSO** - **M**y **S**on **O**edipus)
*   **F**ather + **D**aughter = **E**lectra (**FDE** - **F**ather's **D**ear **E**lectra)
*   **B**rother + **S**ister = **P**haraoh (**BSP** - **B**rother **S**ister **P**yramids)
