# [[Retinoscope]] and [[Retinoscopy]]

The **Retinoscope** is a handheld instrument used to objectively determine the refractive error of the eye (Ametropia) by observing the movement of the light reflected from the retina (red reflex) through the pupil. The procedure is known as **[[Retinoscopy]]**, **Skiascopy**, or the **Shadow Test**,,.

### Principle
Retinoscopy operates on the principle that when light is reflected from a mirror into the eye, the direction in which the light travels across the pupil depends on the refractive state of the eye relative to the observer,.
*   **Goal:** To locate the **[[Far Point]]** (Punctum Remotum) of the patient's eye.
*   **Mechanism:** The illuminated area of the retina acts as an object, and the image is formed at the far point. The examiner neutralizes the movement of the reflex using lenses to bring the far point to the observer's nodal point (peep hole),.

### Types of Retinoscopes

There are two main categories of retinoscopes based on the illumination source and design:

**1. Mirror Retinoscopes** (Historical/Basic)
*   **Plane Mirror:** Reflects light as a divergent beam.
*   **Concave Mirror:** Reflects light as a convergent beam.
*   **Example:** [[Priestley-Smith Retinoscope]] (combines a plane mirror at one end and a concave mirror at the other),.

**2. Self-Illuminated Retinoscopes** (Modern Standard)
*   **[[Spot Retinoscope]]:** Projects a circular beam of light.
*   **[[Streak Retinoscope]]:** Projects a linear streak of light.
    *   **Advantages:** It is the most popular type. It allows for easier determination of the axis of [[astigmatism]] by rotating the streak,. The streak can be widened or narrowed (vergence control) to simulate plane or concave mirror effects.

### Procedure of Retinoscopy

**Setup:**
*   **Environment:** Semi-dark room (Darkroom procedure),.
*   **Distance:** The examiner sits at a fixed distance, usually **1 meter** or **66 cm (arm's length)** from the patient,.
*   **Fixation:** The patient looks at a distant target to relax **[[Accommodation]]**. In children, cycloplegics are used to paralyze accommodation (Wet Retinoscopy).

**Steps:**
1.  The examiner views the red reflex through the peephole.
2.  The retinoscope is moved horizontally and vertically across the pupil.
3.  The movement of the red reflex (shadow) is observed relative to the movement of the retinoscope.

### Interpretation of Reflex Movement

The movement of the reflex depends on the type of mirror used (usually **Plane Mirror** setting in modern streak retinoscopes) and the refractive error.

**Using a Plane Mirror at 1 Meter distance:**

| Movement of Reflex | Interpretation (Refractive State) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **With Movement** | Moves in the *same* direction as the retinoscope. Indicates **[[Hypermetropia]]**, **[[Emmetropia]]**, or **[[Myopia]] < 1 Diopter**,. |
| **Against Movement** | Moves in the *opposite* direction to the retinoscope. Indicates **[[Myopia]] > 1 Diopter**,. |
| **No Movement** | The pupil fills with light or goes dark instantly. This is the **Point of Neutralization**. Indicates **[[Myopia]] of exactly 1 Diopter**,. |

**Using a Concave Mirror:**
*   The movements are **reversed**. "With" movement indicates Myopia > 1D, and "Against" movement indicates Hypermetropia/Emmetropia,.

### Characteristics of the Reflex
The appearance of the reflex changes as the refractive error approaches neutralization,.

| Characteristic | Low Refractive Error (Close to Neutral) | High Refractive Error (Far from Neutral) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Speed** | Fast / Rapid | Slow |
| **Brilliance** | Bright | Dull / Faint |
| **Width** (Streak) | Wide | Narrow |

**Clinical Implication:** A dull, slow, and narrow reflex indicates a high refractive error. As lenses are added and the error is corrected, the reflex becomes brighter, faster, and wider.

---

### Calculation of Refractive Error

The final prescription is calculated by adjusting the lens power found at neutralization (Retinoscopy Value) with correction factors.

**Formula:**
$$Refraction = Retinoscopy Value (RV) - Distance Correction - Cycloplegic Correction$$

**1. Distance Correction:**
*   If performed at **1 meter**: Deduct **1.0 D**,.
*   If performed at **66 cm**: Deduct **1.5 D**,.

**2. Cycloplegic Correction (Tonus Allowance):**
Used to compensate for the return of ciliary muscle tone after the drug wears off,.
*   **[[Atropine]]:** Deduct **1.0 D**
*   **[[Cyclopentolate]]:** Deduct **0.75 D**
*   **[[Homatropine]]:** Deduct **0.5 D**

### Special Clinical Signs

*   **[[Scissoring Reflex]]:** Two bands of light move towards or away from each other like scissors. Seen in **[[Keratoconus]]** and irregular [[astigmatism]],.
*   **Triangular Shadow:** A triangular reflex swirling around the apex is seen in conical cornea (Keratoconus).
*   **Astigmatism Signs:**
    *   **Break phenomenon:** The streak in the pupil is not aligned with the streak outside the pupil (indicates the axis is off).
    *   **Thickness variation:** The streak width varies as it is rotated.
*   **Hazy Media:** In cases of immature cataract or corneal opacity, the reflex is dull. A **Concave Mirror** setting (converging light) is useful here to brighten the reflex.

### Difficulties in Retinoscopy
*   **Small Pupil:** Limits the view; mydriasis is required.
*   **Hazy Media:** Reduces brightness.
*   **Active Accommodation:** Causes fluctuating reflex; requires cycloplegia.

**Mnemonic for Plane Mirror Movement:**
"**P**lane flies **WITH** the **H**igh clouds"
*   **P**lane mirror:
*   **W**ith movement = **H**ypermetropia (and Emmetropia/Low Myopia).
