# [[Medical Law And Ethics]] > Professional Misconduct

### Definition
**Professional Misconduct**, also known as **Infamous Conduct in a Professional Respect**, is defined as any conduct by a medical practitioner which might be reasonably regarded as **disgraceful or dishonourable** by his professional brethren of good repute and competence.

It involves an **abuse of professional position**. It is not merely a violation of law but a violation of the [[Medical Ethics]] code.

### The Warning Notice
The [[State Medical Council]] (SMC) and the National Medical Commission (NMC/MCI) issue a **Warning Notice** to all registered practitioners. This serves as a guideline for offenses that constitute professional misconduct. However, this list is **not exhaustive**; the council can judge other acts as misconduct based on circumstances.

### Common Acts of Professional Misconduct
The infamous conduct usually falls into the **"6 A's"**:
1.  **A**dultery
2.  **A**dvertising
3.  **A**bortion (Illegal)
4.  **A**ssociation (Covering)
5.  **A**ddiction
6.  **A**lcohol

### Disciplinary Action
The [[State Medical Council]] acts as a distinct disciplinary body (Medical Court). Upon receiving a complaint or taking *suo moto* cognizance:

1.  **Inquiry:** The council holds an inquiry where the doctor is given a chance to be heard.
2.  **Punishment:** If found guilty, the following actions are taken:
    *   **Warning:** For minor offenses.
    *   **Temporary Erasure:** Suspension of registration for a specific period.
    *   **[[Penal Erasure]]:** Removal of the name from the medical register permanently. This is known as the **"Professional Death Sentence"** as it deprives the doctor of the right to practice.

**Appeal:**
*   A doctor aggrieved by the SMC decision can appeal to the **Central Government** (which consults the National Medical Commission/MCI).
