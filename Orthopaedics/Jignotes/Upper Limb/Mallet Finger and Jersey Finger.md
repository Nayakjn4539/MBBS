# [[Upper Limb]] > Mallet Finger and Jersey Finger

# Mallet Finger

### Definition and Synonyms
**Mallet Finger** is a flexion deformity of the [[distal interphalangeal joint]] (DIP) caused by the disruption of the [[extensor mechanism]] at its insertion into the base of the distal phalanx.
*   **Synonyms:** Baseball finger, Cricket finger, Drop finger [].

### Mechanism of Injury
*   **Hyperflexion Injury:** It results from sudden **passive flexion** of the distal phalanx while the extensor tendons are actively trying to extend the finger (e.g., a ball striking the tip of the extended finger or "stubbing" the finger while tucking in bedsheets) [], [].
*   **Anatomy Involved:** The thin [[extensor tendon]] is either torn in its substance or avulses a small flake of bone from the base of the [[distal phalanx]] [].

### Classification
1.  **Tendinous Mallet Finger:** Rupture of the tendon substance.
2.  **Bony Mallet Finger:** Avulsion fracture of the dorsal base of the distal phalanx [].
    *   *Stable:* Involves <25% of the articular surface [].
    *   *Unstable:* Involves >25% of the articular surface (often called dorsal basal fractures) [].

### Clinical Features
*   **Look:**
    *   The fingertip droops (flexion deformity at the DIP joint) [].
    *   Swelling and bruising over the dorsal aspect of the DIP joint.
*   **Move:**
    *   **Active extension:** The patient cannot actively straighten the tip of the finger (extension lag) [].
    *   **Passive extension:** Usually normal (the examiner can straighten the finger manually) [].
    *   **Tenderness:** Localized to the DIP joint [].

### Diagnosis and Imaging
*   **X-ray (AP and Lateral views):** Essential to distinguish between a tendinous rupture and a bony avulsion [].
    *   Look for a triangular avulsion fragment at the dorsal base of the distal phalanx [].
    *   Check for volar subluxation of the distal phalanx.

### Treatment
**1. Conservative (Non-operative)**
*   **Indication:** Most tendinous injuries and undisplaced/stable bony fractures.
*   **Method:** **Splinting** the DIP joint in **hyperextension** or neutral position continuously.
*   **Types of Splints:** Stax Mallet splint, Frog splint, or Aluminum foam splint [].
*   **Duration:** Continuous immobilization for **6 to 8 weeks**.
*   **Crucial Rule:** The [[proximal interphalangeal joint]] (PIP) must remain **free** to move to prevent stiffness [], [].

**2. Operative**
*   **Indications:**
    *   Avulsion fracture involving >1/3 of the articular surface.
    *   Volar subluxation of the distal phalanx.
    *   Failure of conservative treatment or chronic cases (>3 weeks) [].
*   **Technique:** Closed reduction and percutaneous fixation with **K-wires** (extension block pinning) [].

### Complications
*   **Swan Neck Deformity:** If the mallet finger is untreated, the extensor hood retracts proximally, causing hyperextension of the PIP joint and flexion of the DIP joint [].
*   Skin maceration or necrosis from improper splinting.
*   Extensor lag (persistent drooping).

# Jersey Finger

### Definition
**Jersey Finger** is the avulsion of the [[flexor digitorum profundus]] (FDP) tendon from its insertion at the volar base of the distal phalanx []. It is essentially the opposite of a mallet finger.

### Mechanism of Injury
*   **Hyperextension Injury:** Occurs when the fingertip is forcibly extended while the FDP muscle is actively contracting (e.g., a rugby or football player grabbing an opponent's jersey as they pull away) [].
*   **Target Digit:** The **Ring finger** is involved in 75% of cases due to its anatomical tethering and weaker independent extension [].

### Clinical Features
*   **Look:**
    *   The finger lies in slight extension relative to the other fingers in the resting cascade [].
    *   Swelling and ecchymosis along the volar surface.
*   **Feel:**
    *   Tenderness may be felt in the palm or proximal finger depending on how far the tendon has retracted.
    *   A tender lump may be palpable in the palm (Leddy-Packer Type I).
*   **Move:**
    *   **Inability to actively flex the DIP joint** [].
    *   Grip strength is reduced.

### Clinical Test
*   **FDP Test:** Stabilize the [[proximal interphalangeal joint]] (PIP) in extension and ask the patient to flex the fingertip. In Jersey finger, the patient cannot perform this action [].

### Imaging
*   **X-ray:**
    *   May show a small bony fragment avulsed from the volar base of the distal phalanx.
    *   The position of the bone fragment helps determine the level of tendon retraction.
*   **Ultrasound/MRI:** Useful to locate the retracted tendon end if X-rays are negative.

### Treatment
*   **Conservative:** Rarely effective because the retracted tendon loses its blood supply (vincula) and cannot heal back to the bone spontaneously.
*   **Operative:** Surgery is almost always required.
    *   **Reattachment:** The tendon is retrieved and reattached to the distal phalanx using suture anchors or pull-out sutures [], [].
    *   **Timing:** Early surgery (within 7-10 days) is crucial before the tendon retracts, scars, and loses viability.

### Clinical Implication
Failure to diagnose Jersey finger often leads to permanent loss of flexion at the DIP joint. If the tendon retracts into the palm (Type I), the blood supply is compromised (vincula rupture), requiring urgent repair within 7-10 days [].

# Comparison: Mallet Finger vs. Jersey Finger

| Feature | Mallet Finger | Jersey Finger |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Structure Involved** | [[Extensor Tendon]] (Terminal slip) | [[Flexor Digitorum Profundus]] (FDP) |
| **Location of Injury** | Dorsal base of distal phalanx | Volar base of distal phalanx |
| **Mechanism** | Forced **Hyperflexion** [] | Forced **Hyperextension** [] |
| **Deformity** | DIP Joint in **Flexion** (cannot extend) | DIP Joint in **Extension** (cannot flex) |
| **Common Sport** | Baseball, Cricket (Ball striking tip) | Rugby, Football (Grabbing jersey) |
| **Most Common Finger** | Middle, Ring, or Little finger | **Ring Finger** (75%) [] |
| **Primary Treatment** | **Splinting** (Conservative) [] | **Surgery** (Repair) [] |

### Mnemonics
*   **M**allet = **M**ostly Splint (Conservative treatment dominates).
*   **J**ersey = **J**ust Surgery (Conservative treatment fails).
*   **Ma**llet affects the **Ex**tensor (**MaEx**).
*   **Jer**sey affects the **Flex**or (**JerFlex**).
