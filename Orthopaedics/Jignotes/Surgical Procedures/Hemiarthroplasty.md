# Hemiarthroplasty

### Definition
[[Hemiarthroplasty]] is a surgical procedure involving the replacement of only one half of the joint with an artificial prosthesis, leaving the other articulating surface intact. It is most commonly performed for the [[hip joint]], where the femoral head and neck are replaced, but the native [[acetabulum]] is preserved. A similar procedure can be performed for the shoulder (replacing the humeral head).

### Indications
The decision to perform a hemiarthroplasty generally depends on the patient's age, functional demands, and the viability of the joint surfaces.

*   **Displaced [[Fracture Neck of Femur]]:** This is the most common indication, specifically in elderly patients (>60-65 years).
    *   *Rationale:* In elderly patients with displaced intracapsular fractures, the risk of [[avascular necrosis]] (AVN) and non-union is high. Hemiarthroplasty allows for immediate weight-bearing and early mobilization, avoiding the complications of prolonged bed rest.
*   **[[Avascular Necrosis]] (AVN):** Indicated if the femoral head is collapsed but the acetabular cartilage is preserved.
*   **Non-union of Femoral Neck Fracture:** In elderly patients where internal fixation has failed.
*   **Tumors:** Primary or metastatic tumors involving the proximal femur or humerus.

### Types of Hemiarthroplasty Prostheses

Prostheses are broadly classified into **Unipolar** and **Bipolar** based on their articulation mechanics.

#### 1. Unipolar Prosthesis
These consist of a single solid piece where the prosthetic head articulates directly with the native acetabulum.

*   **[[Austin Moore Prosthesis]] (AMP):**
    *   **Design:** Has a head, neck, and stem. The stem has **fenestrations** (holes) to allow bone ingrowth for self-locking.
    *   **Fixation:** **Uncemented** (press-fit).
    *   **Indication:** Used when there is a sufficient **[[calcar femorale]]** (at least 1.3 cm or 1/2 inch) to support the collar of the prosthesis.
    *   **Mechanism:** Body weight is transmitted from the acetabulum through the head and collar onto the calcar.

*   **[[Thompson Prosthesis]]:**
    *   **Design:** Has a solid stem without fenestrations.
    *   **Fixation:** **Cemented** using [[polymethyl methacrylate]] (PMMA) bone cement.
    *   **Indication:** Used when the **calcar femorale is deficient** or the medullary canal is very wide (osteoporotic bone), preventing a tight press-fit.

#### 2. [[Bipolar Prosthesis]]
*   **Design:** Consists of a smaller metallic head housed inside a larger polyethylene-lined steel cup. This entire assembly fits into the acetabulum.
*   **Mechanism:** Movement occurs at two interfaces:
    1.  Between the inner head and the shell.
    2.  Between the outer shell and the native acetabulum.
*   **Advantage:** Reduces friction and erosion of the acetabular cartilage (acetabularitis) compared to unipolar prostheses. It increases the longevity of the joint.

### Comparison of Prostheses

| Feature | [[Austin Moore Prosthesis]] | [[Thompson Prosthesis]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fixation** | Uncemented (Press-fit) | Cemented |
| **Stem Design** | Fenestrated (Holes present) | Solid (No holes) |
| **Calcar Requirement** | Needs intact calcar | Can be used with deficient calcar |
| **Locking Mechanism** | Self-locking via bone ingrowth | Cement fixation |
| **Primary Indication** | Good bone stock, narrow canal | Osteoporotic bone, wide canal |

### Surgical Technique (Hip Hemiarthroplasty)

**Approaches:**
*   **Posterior Approach (Moore's):** Most common; minimizes abductor damage but higher risk of posterior dislocation.
*   **Lateral Approach (Hardinge):** Lower dislocation rate but may cause abductor weakness (limp).

**Surgical Steps:**
1.  **Incision & Exposure:** Exposure of the hip joint and capsulotomy.
2.  **Dislocation:** The femoral head is dislocated from the acetabulum.
3.  **Head Extraction:** The femoral head is removed (using a corkscrew instrument if necessary).
4.  **Sizing:** The removed femoral head is measured using a gauge to select the correctly sized prosthesis. *Note: The prosthesis must fit snugly; a loose fit causes instability, a tight fit causes erosion.*
5.  **Canal Preparation:** The femoral neck is trimmed, and the medullary canal is opened with a box chisel and shaped with a **rasp** (broach).
6.  **Trial Reduction:** A trial prosthesis is inserted to check stability, limb length, and range of motion.
7.  **Insertion:**
    *   *Uncemented:* The definitive prosthesis is driven in until seated on the calcar.
    *   *Cemented:* Bone cement is injected into the canal, followed by the prosthesis.
8.  **Reduction:** The hip is reduced, and stability is re-confirmed.
9.  **Closure:** The capsule and soft tissues are repaired over a drain.

### Complications

*   **Intra-operative:**
    *   Fracture of the femoral shaft (during reaming or insertion).
    *   Neurovascular injury (Sciatic nerve).
*   **Early Post-operative:**
    *   **[[Dislocation]]:** More common with posterior approach.
    *   **Infection:** Superficial or deep.
    *   [[Deep Vein Thrombosis]] (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism.
*   **Late Complications:**
    *   **Acetabular Erosion:** The metal head grinds the acetabular cartilage, causing pain and **[[Protrusio Acetabuli]]** (migration of the head into the pelvis). This is less common with Bipolar prostheses.
    *   **Loosening:** Causing thigh pain (toggle effect).
    *   **Periprosthetic Fracture.**

### Clinical Implications and Rehabilitation

*   **Early Mobilization:** Unlike internal fixation (where weight-bearing may be restricted), hemiarthroplasty allows for mobilization as early as the **1st post-operative day**.
*   **Precautions:** Patients are advised to avoid cross-legged sitting, squatting, and low chairs to prevent dislocation (especially in the first 6 weeks).
*   **Conversion:** A failed hemiarthroplasty (due to erosion or loosening) can often be converted to a **[[Total Hip Replacement]]** (THR).

### Mnemonics

*   **A**ustin **M**oore = **A**ir **M**oves (Fenestrated/Holes) + **M**oore bone (Needs More/Good bone stock).
*   **T**hompson = **T**ight (Cemented) + **T**hin bone (Osteoporotic/Wide canal).
