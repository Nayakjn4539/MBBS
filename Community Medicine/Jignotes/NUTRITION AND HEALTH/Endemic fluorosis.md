# [[NUTRITION AND HEALTH]] > Endemic fluorosis

### **Endemic Fluorosis**

[[Endemic Fluorosis]] is a public health problem resulting from the prolonged ingestion of high levels of [[fluorine]] (fluoride), primarily through drinking water. It is often described as a **"double-edged sword"** because while optimal levels prevent dental caries, excess levels lead to toxicity.

### **1. Sources and Requirement**
*   **Major Source:** [[Drinking water]] (90% of intake).
*   **Food Sources:** Sea fish, cheese, and tea are rich in fluorine.
*   **Daily Requirement:** The optimum level in drinking water in India is **0.5 to 0.8 mg/L** (ppm). In temperate climates (where water intake is lower), the limit is up to 1-2 mg/L.

### **2. Biological Effects at Various Levels**
The health impact of fluoride is directly dose-dependent.

| Fluoride Level (mg/L) | Health Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| **< 0.5** | **Dental Caries** (Deficiency) |
| **0.5 – 0.8** | **Optimum** (Prevents caries, healthy bones) |
| **> 1.5** | **Dental Fluorosis** (Mottling of enamel) |
| **3.0 – 6.0** | **Skeletal Fluorosis** |
| **> 10.0** | **Crippling Fluorosis** |

### **3. Clinical Manifestations**

#### **A. Dental Fluorosis**
*   **Pathology:** Affects teeth during the period of calcification (first **7 years** of life). It is **irreversible**.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Mottling:** Starts as chalk-white patches on enamel (loss of lustre).
    *   **Discoloration:** Patches turn yellow, brown, or black (pitting/corroded appearance).
    *   **Location:** Best seen on the **upper incisors**.
    *   **Note:** It affects **permanent teeth**; milk teeth are usually spared.

#### **B. Skeletal Fluorosis**
*   **Pathology:** Heavy deposition of fluoride in the skeleton (Osteosclerosis). Affects older adults after 10–20 years of exposure.
*   **Signs:**
    *   Pain and stiffness in the back (spine) and joints.
    *   **Kyphosis** (hunchback) and immobility of the spine ("Poker Back").
    *   Calcification of ligaments (interosseous membranes).
    *   **Neurological complications:** Compression of the spinal cord/nerve roots leading to quadriplegia or paraplegia.

#### **C. Genu Valgum (Knock-Knee Syndrome)**
*   A specific form seen in **South India** (Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu).
*   **Association:** Linked to the consumption of **Sorghum (Jowar)** as a staple diet.
*   **Mechanism:** Jowar promotes higher retention of ingested fluoride compared to rice-based diets.
*   **Features:** Osteoporosis of lower limbs and severe knock-knees in young adults.

#### **D. Non-Skeletal Manifestations**
*   **Gastrointestinal:** Loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation (due to mucosal irritation).
*   **Urinary:** Polyuria, polydipsia.
*   **Others:** Muscle weakness, anaemia, and decreased thyroid function.

### **4. Diagnosis**
1.  **Clinical:** Mottled teeth (Dental) or stiff spine/joint pain (Skeletal) in an endemic area.
2.  **Chemical:**
    *   **Drinking water fluoride:** > 1.5 ppm.
    *   **Urine fluoride:** > 1.5 mg/L (best indicator of recent exposure).
    *   **Serum fluoride:** > 0.27 ppm.
3.  **Radiological:** X-ray shows increased bone density (**Osteosclerosis**), calcification of interosseous membranes (forearm), and "marble bone" appearance.

### **5. Prevention and Control**
Since fluorosis is irreversible, prevention is the only cure.

#### **A. Changing Water Source**
*   Shift from ground water (wells/borewells) to surface water (rivers/canals) which usually has lower fluoride.
*   Digging deeper wells (though sometimes deep aquifers have *more* fluoride) or mixing high-fluoride water with low-fluoride water.

#### **B. Defluoridation of Water**
Removal of excess fluoride from water.
*   **[[Nalgonda Technique]]:** Developed by **NEERI** (National Environmental Engineering Research Institute), Nagpur. It is a household/community level technique.
    *   **Method:** Sequential addition of **Lime**, **Alum**, and **Bleaching Powder** to water.
    *   **Mechanism:** Rapid mixing $\rightarrow$ Flocculation (Alum settles fluoride) $\rightarrow$ Sedimentation $\rightarrow$ Filtration.
    *   *Note:* **Alum** is the main agent responsible for removing fluoride. Lime maintains pH.

> **Mnemonic for Nalgonda Technique:** **LAB**
> *   **L**ime
> *   **A**lum
> *   **B**leaching Powder

*   **Other Methods:** Reverse Osmosis (RO), Ion Exchange, Activated Alumina.

#### **C. Nutritional Intervention**
*   **Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid):** Helps reduce fluoride toxicity.
*   **Calcium:** Reduces fluoride absorption.
*   Restriction of fluoride-rich foods (tea, sea fish) in endemic areas.

#### **D. Health Education**
*   Avoid fluoridated toothpaste in children **< 6 years** in endemic zones.
*   Promote breast feeding (breast milk is low in fluoride).

> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Draw a flowchart of the Nalgonda Technique: Raw Water + Lime + Alum + Bleaching Powder -> Stirring (10 mins) -> Settling (1 hr) -> Filtration -> Safe Water. Also, a quick sketch of "Mottled Enamel" on upper incisors adds value.

### **Clinical Relevance**
*   **Endemic Belts in India:** Andhra Pradesh (Nalgonda district), Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh. These areas are part of the geographic "fluoride belt."
*   **Differential Diagnosis:** Dental fluorosis must be differentiated from enamel hypoplasia due to nutritional deficiencies. Fluorosis is usually generalized, while hypoplasia is localized.,,,,,,
