# Water: Pollution and Water-borne Diseases

### **I. Water Pollution**

**Definition:** Water is considered polluted or contaminated when it does not fulfill the criteria of [[Safe and wholesome water]] (i.e., free from pathogens/harmful chemicals, pleasant to taste, and usable for domestic purposes),.

**Sources of Pollution:**
1.  **Sewage:** Contains decomposable organic matter and pathogenic agents,.
2.  **Industrial and Trade Wastes:** Toxic agents, metal salts, complex synthetic organic chemicals.
3.  **Agricultural Pollutants:** Fertilizers and pesticides.
4.  **Physical Pollutants:** Heat (thermal pollution) and radioactive substances.

**Indicators of Pollution:**
*   **[[Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)]]:** Amount of oxygen absorbed by sewage in 5 days at 20°C. If BOD > 300 mg/L = Strong sewage; < 100 mg/L = Weak sewage.
*   **Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD):** Measures oxygen equivalent of organic matter susceptible to oxidation by strong chemical oxidizer.
*   **Suspended Solids**.
*   **Dissolved Oxygen**.

### **II. Classification of Water-related Diseases**

Epidemiologically, diseases related to water are classified into four distinct categories based on the mode of transmission,,.

| Category | Definition | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Water-borne diseases]]** | Caused by ingestion of water contaminated by human or animal excreta (Faecal-oral). | **Viral:** [[Hepatitis A]], Hepatitis E, Poliomyelitis, Rotavirus.<br>**Bacterial:** [[Cholera]], [[Typhoid]], Bacillary Dysentery, E. coli diarrhea.<br>**Protozoal:** Amoebiasis, Giardiasis.<br>**Helminthic:** Roundworm. |
| **[[Water-washed diseases]]** | Infections of the outer body surface due to *inadequate* quantity of water for personal hygiene. | Scabies, Trachoma, Conjunctivitis, Typhus, Leprosy. |
| **[[Water-based diseases]]** | Transmitted through an aquatic invertebrate host. | **Snail:** Schistosomiasis.<br>**Cyclops:** [[Dracunculiasis]] (Guinea worm). |
| **[[Water-related diseases]]** | Spread by insects (vectors) that breed in or near water. | Malaria, Filariasis, Dengue, Yellow Fever, Japanese Encephalitis. |

> **Mnemonic for Water-Washed Diseases:**
> **"WASH"** your **F**ace, **E**yes, and **S**kin.
> **F**leas/Lice (Typhus), **E**yes (Trachoma/Conjunctivitis), **S**kin (Scabies/Leprosy).

### **III. Key Water-borne Diseases: Epidemiology & Management**

#### **1. Cholera**
An acute diarrhoeal disease caused by *V. cholerae*.

*   **Agent Factor:** [[Vibrio cholerae]] (O1 and O139). Produces an exotoxin (enterotoxin) acting on adenylate cyclase of intestinal mucosal cells.
*   **Reservoir:** Human being is the only known reservoir (Cases and Carriers).
*   **Transmission:** Fecal-oral route via contaminated water/food; Direct contact.
*   **Incubation Period:** Few hours to 5 days (usually 1-2 days).
*   **Clinical Picture:** Sudden onset of severe watery diarrhea (**Rice water stools**), projectile vomiting, no griping/tenesmus. Leads to severe dehydration, acidosis, and shock.
*   **Diagnosis:** Stool culture (Gold standard), Dark field illumination (Shooting star motility). Transport media: VR fluid.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Rehydration:** [[Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS)]] is the sheet anchor. IV Ringer's Lactate for severe dehydration.
    *   **Antibiotics:** Tetracycline/Doxycycline (adjunct to reduce duration).
*   **Prevention:** Safe water, [[Sanitation Barrier]], Health education. Mass chemoprophylaxis is **not** advised for the total community.
*   **Vaccines:** Oral cholera vaccines exist but sanitation is primary.

#### **2. Typhoid Fever (Enteric Fever)**
*   **Agent Factor:** [[Salmonella typhi]].
*   **Reservoir:** Man (Cases and Carriers). Chronic carriers (excrete bacilli >1 year) often harbor infection in the gallbladder.
*   **Transmission:** Fecal-oral or Urine-oral route.
*   **Incubation Period:** Usually 10-14 days.
*   **Clinical Picture:** Continuous step-ladder fever, relative bradycardia, rose spots (2nd week), splenomegaly, pea-soup diarrhea.
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   **Mnemonic: BASU**
    *   **B**lood culture (1st Week)
    *   **A**gglutination/Widal (2nd Week)
    *   **S**tool culture (3rd Week)
    *   **U**rine culture (4th Week).
*   **Treatment:** Antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin, Ceftriaxone).
*   **Prevention:** Improvement of basic sanitation, immunization (Vi polysaccharide vaccine, Ty21a).

#### **3. Viral Hepatitis (A & E)**
*   **Hepatitis A:** Caused by Enterovirus 72 (Picornavirus). Transmitted via fecal-oral route. Common in children. No carrier state.
*   **Hepatitis E:** Water-borne. Severe in **pregnant women** (high mortality).

### **IV. Prevention and Control of Water-borne Diseases**

#### **1. Purification of Water**
*   **Large Scale:** Storage (Physical/Chemical/Biological purification), Filtration (Slow sand/Rapid sand), Disinfection (Chlorination).
*   **Small Scale (Household):** Boiling (best method), Chemical disinfection (Bleaching powder, Chlorine tablets), Filtration (Ceramic filters).

#### **2. Chlorination**
*   **Principle:** Formation of [[Hypochlorous acid]] (HOCl), which is the main disinfecting agent.
*   **Action:** Kills bacteria/viruses but **not** spores or protozoal cysts.
*   **Criteria:**
    *   Residual chlorine for drinking water: **0.5 mg/L** after 1 hour contact.
    *   Post-disaster/Epidemic: **0.7 mg/L**.
    *   Swimming pools: **> 1.0 mg/L**.
*   **Testing:**
    *   **[[Horrock's Apparatus]]:** Used to estimate "Chlorine Demand".
    *   **Orthotolidine (OT) Test:** Measures free and combined chlorine.

#### **3. The Sanitation Barrier**
This involves breaking the chain of transmission by segregating excreta (faeces) from water, food, and soil.
*   > [!warning] Diagram Alert
> A flow chart showing faeces -> Fluids/Fingers/Flies/Fields/Food -> New Host. A "Barrier" line cuts off the faeces from these 5 F's.
