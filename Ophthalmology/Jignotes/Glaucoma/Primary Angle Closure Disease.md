# [[Glaucoma]] > Primary Angle Closure Disease

# Primary Angle Closure Disease (PACD)

**Primary Angle Closure Disease (PACD)** encompasses a spectrum of conditions where the [[peripheral iris]] is in apposition to the [[trabecular meshwork]], resulting in the obstruction of [[aqueous outflow]] from the anterior chamber.

### Epidemiology and Risk Factors
*   **Demographics:**
    *   **Race:** Highest prevalence in **Asians** (Chinese, South-East Asians), Eskimos/Inuits. Uncommon in Africans/Caucasians.
    *   **Gender:** Females > Males (ratio approx. 3:1 to 4:1).
    *   **Age:** Usually presents in 5th to 7th decade (Peak > 55 years).
*   **Anatomical Predisposing Factors:**
    *   **Globe:** Short [[axial length]] (Hypermetropic eyes).
    *   **Cornea:** Small corneal diameter.
    *   **Anterior Chamber:** Shallow [[anterior chamber]] (AC) depth and volume.
    *   **Lens:** Relatively large/thick lens; anteriorly positioned lens-iris diaphragm.
    *   **Angle:** Narrow recess.

### Pathogenesis: Mechanisms of Closure
1.  **Pupillary Block (Most Common - 70%):**
    *   Mid-dilated pupil increases contact between the iris and lens.
    *   Resistance to aqueous flow from posterior to anterior chamber.
    *   Pressure builds in posterior chamber $\rightarrow$ **[[Iris Bombe]]** (forward bowing of iris).
    *   Peripheral iris blocks the trabecular meshwork.
2.  **Plateau Iris Configuration:**
    *   Anteriorly positioned [[ciliary processes]] push the peripheral iris forward against the meshwork.
    *   Central AC depth is normal, but the angle is narrow ("Sine wave" iris configuration).
3.  **Phacomorphic Mechanism:**
    *   A swollen/intumescent lens pushes the iris forward (Secondary angle closure mechanism often grouped here).

### Classification (ISGEO System)
The **International Society of Geographical and Epidemiological Ophthalmology (ISGEO)** classification is based on the natural history and prognosis.

| Category | Gonioscopy (ITC > 180°)* | IOP | PAS (Peripheral Anterior Synechiae) | Optic Disc/Visual Field Damage | Clinical Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Primary Angle Closure Suspect]] (PACS)** | Present | Normal | Absent | Absent | Angle "at risk". Prophylactic LPI may be considered. |
| **[[Primary Angle Closure]] (PAC)** | Present | **Raised** | **Present** (Variable) | **Absent** | Pathological closure has occurred but nerve is intact. Needs LPI. |
| **[[Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma]] (PACG)** | Present | Raised | Present | **Present** | Definitive glaucoma. Needs LPI + Medical/Surgical management. |

### Clinical Stages and Presentation
Traditionally divided into clinical phases based on symptoms.

#### 1. Latent / Suspect (PACS)
*   **Symptoms:** Asymptomatic.
*   **Signs:** Shallow anterior chamber, convex iris lens diaphragm.
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   **[[Eclipse Sign]]** (Oblique flashlight test): Shadow on the nasal iris when light is shone from the temporal side.
    *   **[[Van Herick Method]]**: Peripheral AC depth < 1/4 corneal thickness.
    *   **[[Gonioscopy]]**: Posterior trabecular meshwork not visible in > 180° without indentation.

#### 2. Intermittent / Subacute PAC
*   **Mechanism:** Physiological mydriasis (e.g., dim light, emotional stress) or mydriatics precipitate transient closure.
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Transient blurring of vision (due to mild corneal edema).
    *   **Colored halos** around lights (Rainbow colored: Blue inside, Red outside).
    *   Mild frontal headache/brow ache.
*   **Resolution:** Often self-limiting as miosis (sleep/bright light) breaks the block.
*   **Differentiation:** [[Fincham's Test]] (Stenopaeic slit) differentiates glaucomatous halos (remain intact) from cataractous halos (broken up).

#### 3. Acute Primary Angle Closure (Acute Congestive Glaucoma)
*   **Definition:** Ocular Emergency. Sudden total closure of the angle.
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Pain:** Severe, excruciating, radiating to the head (trigeminal distribution).
    *   **Vision:** Rapid, marked loss of vision.
    *   **Systemic:** Nausea, vomiting, prostration (often misdiagnosed as acute abdomen/migraine).
    *   **Halos:** Colored halos around lights.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Lids:** Edematous.
    *   **Conjunctiva:** Chemosis, circumcorneal congestion.
    *   **Cornea:** Steamy/hazy (epithelial edema due to high IOP). insensitive.
    *   **Anterior Chamber:** Very shallow/flat. Flare and cells may be present.
    *   **Pupil:** **[[Vertically oval pupil]]**, mid-dilated, fixed (non-reactive to light).
    *   **IOP:** Markedly elevated (40–70 mmHg). Stony hard eye.
    *   **Fellow Eye:** Shows shallow AC and narrow angle (Occludable).

**> [!warning] Diagram Alert
> Acute Congestive Glaucoma**
*Draw an eye with ciliary congestion, a hazy cornea, and a vertically oval, mid-dilated pupil. Show a shallow anterior chamber in cross-section.*

#### 4. Post-Congestive Stage (Sequelae of Acute Attack)
If the acute attack resolves (spontaneously or with treatment), specific signs remain.
*   **[[Vogt's Triad]] of Post-Congestive Glaucoma:**
    1.  **[[Glaukomflecken]]**: Grey-white anterior subcapsular lens opacities (due to ischemia of lens epithelium).
    2.  **[[Iris Atrophy]]**: Sectoral (usually superior/spiral atrophy) causing correctopia.
    3.  **Fixed Pupil**: Slightly dilated, non-reactive.
*   **Fundus:** Optic disc may be hyperemic initially, later edematous or pallid.

#### 5. Chronic PACG
*   **Mechanism:** "Creeping" angle closure (Zipper closure) where PAS gradually closes the angle.
*   **Symptoms:** Often asymptomatic (like POAG) or mild periodic headaches.
*   **Signs:** Elevated IOP, PAS on gonioscopy, **Glaucomatous Cupping**, **Visual Field Defects**.

#### 6. Absolute Glaucoma
*   End-stage of untreated glaucoma.
*   **Features:** Painful blind eye, stony hard IOP, bullous keratopathy, atrophic iris, optic atrophy.

### Diagnosis and Investigations

1.  **[[Gonioscopy]] (Gold Standard):**
    *   Differentiates Open vs. Closed angle.
    *   **[[Indentation Gonioscopy]] (Sussman/Zeiss 4-mirror):** Crucial to differentiate **Appositional Closure** (opens on indentation $\rightarrow$ reversible with LPI) vs. **Synechial Closure** (PAS present, does not open $\rightarrow$ usually needs surgery).
2.  **Tonometry:** Assess IOP (Goldmann Applanation).
3.  **UBM (Ultrasound Biomicroscopy) / AS-OCT:** Visualizes angle structures, ciliary body position (Plateau iris), and retro-iridal mechanisms.
4.  **Provocative Tests** (Historical importance/Borderline cases):
    *   **Prone Dark Room Test:** IOP rises >8 mmHg after lying prone in dark for 1 hour.
    *   **Mydriatic Test:** 10% Phenylephrine/Tropicamide.

### Management

#### A. Management of Acute Acute Primary Angle Closure
**Goal:** Immediate lowering of IOP to clear cornea and allow iris perfusion, followed by definitive laser treatment.

**1. Immediate Medical Therapy:**
*   **Hyperosmotics:** **IV [[Mannitol]]** (20% solution, 1-2 g/kg) is the drug of choice. Rapidly dehydrates vitreous. Alternatively: Oral Glycerol.
*   **Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors:** IV/Oral [[Acetazolamide]] (500mg stat).
*   **Miotics:** **[[Pilocarpine]]** (2% or 4%).
    *   *Clinical Implication:* Pilocarpine is ineffective if IOP > 40-50 mmHg because the iris sphincter is ischemic (paralyzed). Start Pilocarpine *after* reducing IOP with Mannitol/Acetazolamide.
    *   Instill 1 drop every 15 mins for 1 hour, then q.i.d.
    *   Instill Pilocarpine 1% in the **fellow eye** (prophylaxis).
*   **Suppressive Therapy:** Topical Beta-blockers (Timolol 0.5%), Alpha-agonists (Brimonidine), Steroids (to reduce inflammation).
*   **Analgesics & Antiemetics:** For pain and vomiting.

**2. Definitive Treatment:**
*   **[[Laser Peripheral Iridotomy]] (LPI):**
    *   **Nd:YAG Laser**.
    *   Creates a hole in peripheral iris (usually superiorly, covered by lid, between 11 and 1 o'clock) to bypass pupillary block.
    *   Indicated once cornea is clear.

#### B. Management of PACS / PAC / Chronic PACG
1.  **[[Laser Peripheral Iridotomy]] (LPI):** First-line treatment for all stages involving pupillary block.
2.  **Medical Therapy:** If IOP remains high after LPI (due to TM damage or mixed mechanism).
3.  **Surgery:**
    *   **[[Trabeculectomy]]**: If LPI and maximum medical therapy fail to control IOP or if PAS covers > 270° of the angle.
    *   **Clear Lens Extraction (CLE):** Removing the crystalline lens deepens the AC and opens the angle (increasingly preferred, especially in hypermetropes > 50 years).

#### C. Management of Fellow Eye
*   The fellow eye has a 50% chance of developing an acute attack if untreated.
*   **Prophylactic YAG Laser Iridotomy** is mandatory.
