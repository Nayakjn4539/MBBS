# [[PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IN OBSTETRICS, PAEDIATRICS AND GERIATRICS]] > Prevalence of anaemia among pregnant women is high compared to state and national average in the block of your posting. As BMOH of the block, design an implementation plan to address the issue.

As the **Block Medical Officer of Health (BMOH)**, the implementation plan to address the high prevalence of anemia among pregnant women will be based on the **[[Anemia Mukt Bharat (AMB)]]** strategy and the **[[Reproductive and Child Health (RCH)]]** programme guidelines.

### 1. Situation Analysis and Micro-planning
*   **Baseline Assessment:** Conduct a rapid survey using **[[ASHA]]** and **[[Anganwadi Workers (AWW)]]** to estimate the exact caseload and identify "hotspot" villages with the highest prevalence.
*   **Line Listing:** Update the tracking list of all registered antenatal cases, specifically flagging those with severe anemia (Hb < 7 g/dl).
*   **Resource Mapping:** Assess stock of **[[Iron Folic Acid (IFA)]]** tablets (Red), Albendazole, testing kits (digital hemoglobinometers), and injectable iron (Iron Sucrose/FCM) at PHCs and CHCs.

### 2. Strategic Objectives
*   **Primary Goal:** To reduce the prevalence of anemia by 3% points per year (AMB target).
*   **Secondary Goal:** To ensure 100% coverage of IFA supplementation and deworming for all pregnant women in the block.

### 3. Implementation Strategy (The 6 $\times$ 6 $\times$ 6 AMB Framework)
The plan will focus on the **6 Interventions** relevant to maternal health:
1.  Prophylactic Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation.
2.  Periodic Deworming.
3.  Intensified year-round **[[Behavior Change Communication (BCC)]]** campaign.
4.  Testing of anemia using digital methods (Point of Care).
5.  Mandatory provision of IFA fortified foods.
6.  Addressing non-nutritional causes (Malaria/Fluorosis).

### 4. Detailed Action Plan

#### A. Logistics and Supply Chain Management
*   **Buffer Stock:** Ensure availability of "Red" IFA tablets (60 mg elemental iron + 500 mcg folic acid) at all Sub-centres (SC) and **[[Primary Health Centres (PHC)]]**.
*   **Testing Kits:** Procure and distribute digital hemoglobinometers and testing strips to ANMs for accurate field testing.
*   **Deworming:** Ensure stock of Tab. Albendazole (400 mg).

#### B. Capacity Building
*   **Training:** Re-orient ANMs and ASHAs on:
    *   Correct technique of Hb estimation.
    *   Dosage and side effects of IFA (black stools, gastritis).
    *   Identification of signs of severe anemia (breathlessness, pallor, tachycardia).
    *   **[[GATHER approach]]** for counselling on diet and compliance.

#### C. Service Delivery Strengthening
*   **Universal Screening:** Mandatory Hb testing for every pregnant woman at registration (within 12 weeks).
*   **Fixed Day Approach:** Utilize **[[Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA)]]** on the **9th of every month** for screening high-risk cases by Medical Officers.
*   **Deworming:** Administer one tablet of **Albendazole (400 mg)** in the 2nd trimester to all pregnant women.
*   **Active Case Finding:** Instruct ASHAs to conduct home visits to monitor drug compliance and check for side effects.

#### D. Dietary and Environmental Interventions
*   **Fortification:** Promote the use of **[[Double Fortified Salt]]** (Iron + Iodine) in households and Anganwadi centers.
*   **Dietary Diversification:** Promote consumption of locally available iron-rich foods (green leafy vegetables, jaggery) and Vitamin C (amla, lemon) to enhance absorption.
*   **Malaria Control:** Distribute **[[Insecticide Treated Bed Nets (ITBN)]]** to pregnant women in malaria-endemic zones of the block.

### 5. Treatment Protocol (Standard Operating Procedure)

| Status | Hemoglobin Level | Intervention Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Normal** | $\ge$ 11 g/dl | **Prophylaxis:** 1 IFA tablet (Red) daily starting from 4th month continued for 180 days postpartum. |
| **Mild/Moderate Anemia** | 7 – 10.9 g/dl | **Therapeutic:** 2 IFA tablets daily (one morning, one evening). Recheck Hb after 1 month. |
| **Severe Anemia** | < 7 g/dl | **Immediate Referral:** Refer to **[[First Referral Unit (FRU)]]** or District Hospital. Manage with parenteral iron (Iron Sucrose/FCM) or Blood Transfusion. |
| **Critical** | < 5 g/dl | **Emergency:** Urgent hospitalization and intensive management. |

### 6. Monitoring and Supervision (Supportive Supervision)
*   **Dashboard Monitoring:** Review HMIS data monthly to track:
    *   % of women with Hb < 11 g/dl.
    *   % of women receiving 180 IFA tablets.
*   **Line Listing Review:** Weekly review of the "High Risk Pregnancy" register with ANMs to track severe anemia cases.
*   **Compliance Checks:** ASHAs to count empty blister packs during home visits to ensure adherence.

### 7. IEC/BCC Activities (Community Mobilization)
*   **T3 Camps:** Organize **Test, Treat, and Talk** (T3) camps at the village level.
*   **Counselling:** Educate mothers to avoid tea/coffee immediately after meals (inhibits iron absorption) and take IFA tablets after meals to reduce nausea.
*   **Nutrition Days:** Utilize **[[Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Day (VHSND)]]** to demonstrate cooking in iron vessels.

### Mnemonic for Management
**"SCREAM"** to manage Anemia:
*   **S** - **S**creening (Universal Hb testing).
*   **C** - **C**ompliance check (IFA intake).
*   **R** - **R**eferral (if Hb < 7 g/dl).
*   **E** - **E**ducation (Diet & Deworming).
*   **A** - **A**lailability (Drugs & Kits).
*   **M** - **M**onitoring (Line listing).

### Clinical Relevance
**Severe Anemia in Pregnancy** is a direct cause of maternal mortality (due to heart failure) and an indirect cause (poor tolerance to blood loss during PPH). It significantly increases the risk of **[[Low Birth Weight (LBW)]]** and Preterm labor.
