# [[Corrosive Poisons]] > Organic corrosive acids

### Classification of Organic Corrosive Acids
Organic acids are carbon-containing compounds that act as corrosives. They are generally weaker than mineral acids (inorganic) but have specific systemic toxicities.

**Common Organic Acids:**
1.  **[[Carbolic Acid]] (Phenol)**
2.  **[[Oxalic Acid]]**
3.  **[[Acetic Acid]]** (Concentrated form: Glacial Acetic Acid)
4.  **[[Formic Acid]]**
5.  **[[Salicylic Acid]]**

### 1. Carbolic Acid (Phenol)
Phenol is a hydroxybenzene obtained from coal tar distillation. It differs from other acids as it has a potent **anesthetic effect** locally and **CNS depressant** effect systemically,.

**Properties:**
*   Colorless, prismatic needle-like crystals that turn pink/red on exposure to air/light.
*   Sweetish burning taste and characteristic **phenolic/carbolic odor**,.
*   Soluble in alcohol, glycerine, and ether.
*   **Lysol** is a 50% solution of cresol in saponified vegetable oil.

**Mechanism of Action:**
1.  **Local:** Causes **coagulation necrosis** but does not cause severe destruction like mineral acids because the coagulum prevents further penetration. It penetrates intact skin.
2.  **Systemic:** Severe **CNS depressant** (leading to coma) and renal damage.

**Clinical Features:**
*   **Local:**
    *   Burning pain initially, followed by **tingling and numbness** (local anesthesia),.
    *   Lips and mouth show corrosion which is **chalky white** initially, turning brown later.
    *   **Leathery stomach:** Mucosa becomes hard, corrugated, and white/grey.
*   **Systemic:**
    *   **CNS:** Giddiness, headache, contracted pupils (miosis), coma, and respiratory failure,.
    *   **Renal:** Oliguria and albuminuria.
    *   **[[Carboluria]]:** Urine turns **dark green** or black on exposure to air due to oxidation of hydroquinone and pyrocatechol metabolites,.

**Chronic Poisoning ([[Carbol Marasmus]] / Ochronosis):**
*   Seen in prolonged use of phenol dressings or occupational exposure.
*   **Symptoms:** Anorexia, weight loss, dark urine, and pigmentation of skin/cartilage/sclera known as **[[Ochronosis]]**.

**Fatal Dose & Period:**
*   **Fatal Dose:** 10–15 grams (pure phenol); 30–60 ml (commercial).
*   **Fatal Period:** 3–4 hours (very rapid death possible).

**Treatment:**
1.  **Decontamination:** Wash skin with water or polyethylene glycol/glycerine/alcohol (water alone is less effective as phenol is lipid-soluble).
2.  **[[Gastric Lavage]]:** Can be performed cautiously. The mucosa becomes hard and leathery, reducing perforation risk compared to mineral acids,.
    *   Lavage fluid: Warm water containing magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) or olive oil/castor oil (dissolves phenol and retards absorption).
3.  **Demulcents:** Egg whites or milk.
4.  **Symptomatic:** Treat shock and respiratory failure.

**Autopsy Findings:**
*   **External:** Chemical burns (white/brown) at angles of mouth/chin. Phenolic odor.
*   **Internal:**
    *   Mucosa of esophagus and stomach appears **leathery, tough, and white/grey**.
    *   Kidneys may show hemorrhagic nephritis.

**Medicolegal Aspects:**
*   Mostly suicidal or accidental.
*   Occasionally used for abortion.
*   Rarely homicidal due to smell.

### 2. Oxalic Acid
Known as "Acid of Sugar." It is used industrially as a bleaching agent, metal polish, and **ink remover**,.

**Mechanism of Action:**
1.  **Local:** Corrosive to mucous membranes (irritant in dilute forms).
2.  **Systemic:**
    *   **[[Hypocalcemia]]:** Combines with serum calcium to form insoluble calcium oxalate, leading to tetany and cardiac arrhythmias.
    *   **Renal:** Calcium oxalate crystals block renal tubules causing acute tubular necrosis (renal failure),.

**Clinical Features:**
*   **Local:** Sour/acidic taste. Burning sensation in throat/stomach.
*   **Vomiting:** Coffee-ground vomitus (altered blood).
*   **Systemic:**
    *   Signs of **Hypocalcemia/Tetany**: Muscle cramps, numbness, carpopedal spasm (**Accoucher’s hand**).
    *   **Chvostek’s sign:** Facial twitching on tapping the facial nerve.
    *   **Trousseau’s sign:** Carpal spasm upon inflating BP cuff.
    *   Dyspnea, convulsions, and cardiovascular collapse.

**Fatal Dose & Period:**
*   **Fatal Dose:** 15–20 grams.
*   **Fatal Period:** 1–2 hours.

**Treatment:**
1.  **[[Gastric Lavage]]:** With **lime water** or **calcium gluconate/lactate**.
    *   *Caution:* Do **NOT** use alkalis like sodium/potassium bicarbonate because they form soluble oxalates which are rapidly absorbed and increase systemic toxicity.
2.  **Antidotes:** Calcium preparations (Chalk, milk, calcium gluconate IV) to precipitate oxalate as insoluble calcium oxalate.
3.  **Supportive:** Treat tetany (IV Calcium gluconate) and renal failure (fluids/dialysis).

**Autopsy Findings:**
*   Mucosa of the stomach appears **bleached, white, or scalded**,.
*   Kidneys are congested; microscopy reveals **calcium oxalate crystals** in tubules,.

**Medicolegal Aspects:**
*   Accidental poisoning (mistaken for sugar/Epsom salt).
*   Used by forgers to remove ink/signatures from documents.
*   Vegetable poisons: Found in **Rhubarb leaves** and *Sorrel*.

### 3. Acetic Acid
*   **Forms:** Vinegar (4-5% dilute), Glacial acetic acid (99% concentrated).
*   **Symptoms:** Strong vinegar odor, respiratory irritation (cough, dyspnea), pulmonary edema upon inhalation. Oral ingestion causes corrosion similar to mineral acids but less severe.
*   **Treatment:** Dilution with water/milk. Symptomatic care. Avoid gastric lavage in concentrated cases.
*   **Medicolegal:** Usually accidental.

---

### 4. Formic Acid
*   **Source:** Red ants (*Formica rufa*), rubber industry.
*   **Action:** Coagulative necrosis locally; systemic **metabolic acidosis** and hemolysis. It inhibits aerobic respiration (cytochrome oxidase) leading to "Shock Lung".
*   **Toxicity:** Major metabolite of **[[Methanol]]** responsible for blindness and acidosis.
*   **Treatment:** Supportive; correction of acidosis.

---

### 5. Salicylic Acid
*   Found in **Aspirin** (Acetylsalicylic acid).
*   **Toxicity:** Causes acid-base disturbance (Respiratory alkalosis followed by Metabolic acidosis), hyperpyrexia, and hypoprothrombinemia.
*   **Diagnosis:** **Ferric chloride test** (violet color in urine).

---

### Mnemonic for Oxalic Acid Treatment
**"No Soda for Sugar Acid"**
*   **No Soda:** Do not use Sodium/Potassium bicarbonate (forms soluble oxalates).
*   **Sugar Acid:** Oxalic acid is called Acid of Sugar.
*   **Use:** Calcium (Chalk/Lime/Milk).
