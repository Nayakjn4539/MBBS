# [[INTERNATIONAL HEALTH]] > UNICEF

## UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund)

[[UNICEF]] is a specialized agency of the United Nations, dedicated to the long-term humanitarian and developmental assistance to children and mothers.

### **Historical Background and Organization**
*   **Establishment:** Founded in **1946** by the UN General Assembly.
*   **Original Name:** United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund. It was created to provide relief to children in war-ravaged countries after World War II.
*   **Name Change:** In **1953**, the UN extended its mandate indefinitely. The words "International" and "Emergency" were dropped, becoming the **United Nations Children's Fund**, but the acronym **UNICEF** was retained.
*   **Headquarters:** **New York, USA**.
*   **Governance:** It is governed by an **Executive Board** (comprising 30-36 nations).
*   **Regional Office:** For the **South Central Asian Region** (covering India, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Pakistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Nepal), the regional office is located in **New Delhi** (and Kathmandu).

### **Core Philosophy: The "Whole Child"**
*   In the early years, UNICEF worked closely with [[WHO]] on specific disease campaigns (Malaria, TB, VD).
*   Recently, the focus shifted from specific disease eradication to the concept of the **"Whole Child"**.
*   This approach implies that assistance is geared not just towards immediate health and nutrition, but also towards the long-term personal development of the child and the development of the country they live in.
*   This is often implemented through **[[Country Health Programming]]**.
