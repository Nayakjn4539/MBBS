# [[Ear]] > Furunculosis

### **Furunculosis of the External Ear**

**Definition**
**Furunculosis** is a localized form of **acute otitis externa** characterized by a staphylococcal infection of the hair follicle. It is restricted to the **cartilaginous part** of the [[External Auditory Canal]] (outer one-third), as the bony part (inner two-thirds) is devoid of hair follicles.

**Etiology**
*   **Causative Organism:** *[[Staphylococcus aureus]]* is the most common causative agent.
*   **Predisposing Factors:**
    *   Trauma to the canal skin (scratching with hairpins, matchsticks, or dirty fingers).
    *   Diabetes mellitus (common in recurrent cases).
    *   Use of contaminated hearing aids or ear molds.
    *   Nasal vestibule acting as a reservoir for Staphylococci, transferred by fingers.

### **Clinical Features**

**Symptoms**
*   **Severe Otalgia:** The pain is excruciating and often disproportionate to the size of the furuncle due to the high tension in the tightly adherent skin of the canal.
*   **Jaw Movement Pain:** Pain is aggravated by jaw movements (chewing, yawning) because the temporomandibular joint impinges on the cartilaginous EAC.
*   **Hearing Loss:** Mild [[Conductive Hearing Loss]] may occur if the furuncle is large enough to occlude the meatus.
*   **Discharge:** If the boil bursts, a purulent discharge may be seen.

**Signs**
*   **Tragal Tenderness (Positive Tragal Sign):** Severe pain is elicited on pressing the tragus or pulling the pinna.
*   **Localized Swelling:** A small, tender, red boil is visible in the cartilaginous part of the meatus.
*   **Retroauricular Groove Obliteration:** If the furuncle is on the posterior meatal wall, edema can spread to the postauricular sulcus, obliterating the groove and pushing the pinna forward.
*   **Lymphadenopathy:** Enlargement and tenderness of preauricular, postauricular, or infra-auricular lymph nodes.
*   **Tympanic Membrane:** Usually normal, though it may be obscured by swelling.

> **Clinical Implication:** **Discharge Character**
> In furunculosis, the discharge is frankly **purulent**. It is *never* mucoid because the external ear canal lacks mucus-secreting glands. Presence of mucus indicates a middle ear origin (e.g., perforated CSOM).

### **Differential Diagnosis**

The most important differential diagnosis is **[[Acute Mastoiditis]]**.

| Feature | Furunculosis | Acute Mastoiditis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **History** | No history of middle ear infection/URTI | History of [[Acute Otitis Media]] (AOM) |
| **Pain** | Aggravated by jaw movement/pinna traction | Persistent deep bone pain, not aggravated by jaw movement |
| **Discharge** | Purulent (thick), never mucoid | Mucoid or mucopurulent, often pulsatile |
| **Tenderness** | **Tragal tenderness** present | **Mastoid tenderness** (over Macewen's triangle or tip) |
| **Swelling** | Confined to cartilaginous part (outer 1/3) | Sagging of posterosuperior bony canal wall (inner 1/2) |
| **Retroauricular Groove** | **Obliterated** due to edema | Groove preserved (pinna pushed down and out) |
| **Hearing** | Normal or mild conductive loss | Moderate to severe conductive loss |
| **Tympanic Membrane** | Normal | Perforated or congested |
| **X-Ray Mastoid** | Clear air cells | Clouding of air cells |

### **Treatment**

**Early Stage (No Abscess)**
*   **Systemic Antibiotics:** Anti-staphylococcal antibiotics (e.g., Cloxacillin, Fluoroquinolones).
*   **Analgesics:** To control severe pain.
*   **Local Heat:** Warm compresses to soothe pain.
*   **Ear Pack:** An ear pack soaked in **10% [[Ichthammol Glycerine]]** is inserted into the canal.
    *   *Glycerine:* Hygroscopic action reduces edema.
    *   *Ichthammol:* Acts as a mild antiseptic and local irritant to increase vascularity.
    *   Provides splintage to the canal to reduce pain on jaw movement.

**Late Stage (Abscess Formed)**
*   **Incision and Drainage (I&D):** If the boil points or becomes fluctuant, it should be incised.
    *   *Note:* Do not squeeze the boil prematurely to avoid spread of infection (potential cavernous sinus thrombosis via venous spread, though rare from ear compared to nose).

**Recurrent Furunculosis**
*   Rule out **[[Diabetes Mellitus]]**.
*   Treat staphylococcal carrier state in the nasal vestibule or skin.
*   Maintain ear hygiene and avoid scratching/trauma.
