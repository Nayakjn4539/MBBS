# Plates in Orthopedics

### Introduction
**Plates** are surface implants used for [[internal fixation]] (osteosynthesis) of fractures. They act as internal splints to hold fracture fragments together until union occurs. Unlike [[intramedullary nails]] which are load-sharing devices, plates are generally **load-bearing devices**.

### General Principles and Functions
Plates serve various biomechanical functions depending on how they are applied:

1.  **Neutralization Plate:** Used to bridge a fracture and neutralize deforming forces (torsion, bending, shear) to protect interfragmentary screw fixation.
2.  **Compression Plate:** Achieves axial compression between fracture fragments to promote **primary bone healing** (union without callus),.
3.  **Buttress Plate:** Used to support or "buttress" an articular surface or metaphyseal fragment against collapsing forces (e.g., in [[tibial plateau fractures]]),.
4.  **Tension Band Plate:** Applied to the tension side of a bone (eccentrically loaded bone) to convert tensile forces into compressive forces at the fracture cortex (e.g., Femur, Ulna).
5.  **Bridge Plating:** Used in comminuted fractures where the plate spans the zone of comminution without disturbing the fragments, preserving biology ([[biological fixation]]).

### Classification and Types of Plates

#### 1. Ordinary / Positional Plates
*   **Description:** Standard plates with round holes.
*   **Function:** Act merely as positional plates to hold fractures; do not inherently produce compression.
*   **Example:** [[Semitubular plate]] (used for subcutaneous bones like the ulna or fibula).

#### 2. Dynamic Compression Plate (DCP)
*   **Mechanism:** Uses the **Spherical Gliding Principle**. The screw holes are oval-shaped with an inclined ramp. As the screw is tightened eccentrically, the screw head glides down the ramp, forcing the underlying bone fragment to move towards the fracture site, creating compression,.
*   **Drill Guides:**
    *   **Neutral Guide (Green):** Centers the screw in the hole.
    *   **Eccentric/Load Guide (Yellow):** Places the screw 1mm off-center to generate compression.
*   **Disadvantage:** High contact area with bone can lead to [[periosteal stripping]] and cortical necrosis under the plate.

#### 3. Limited Contact-Dynamic Compression Plate (LC-DCP)
*   **Design:** The undersurface of the plate is grooved/undercut.
*   **Benefit:** Reduces the contact area between the plate and the bone by approximately 50%, preserving the [[periosteal blood supply]] and reducing the risk of bone necrosis.
*   **Features:** Allows for multidirectional screw insertion and easier contouring.

#### 4. Locking Compression Plate (LCP)
*   **Design:** Features **Combi-holes** (figure-of-8 shaped).
    *   One side of the hole is threaded for **locking screws**.
    *   The other side is unthreaded (ramp) for standard **cortical screws** or **cancellous screws**,.
*   **Mechanism:** The screw head locks into the plate, creating a fixed-angle construct. It acts as an **internal fixator**.
*   **Clinical Indication:**
    *   [[Osteoporotic bone]] (screw hold depends on the plate, not just bone quality).
    *   Comminuted fractures.
    *   Minimally invasive surgery.

#### 5. Special Anatomical Plates
*   **Buttress Plates:** Used at the expanded ends of long bones (metaphysis).
    *   *Shapes:* T-plate, L-plate, Spoon plate, Cloverleaf plate.
    *   *Sites:* [[Proximal tibia fractures]], [[distal radius fractures]].
*   **Reconstruction Plates:** Malleable plates with deep notches between holes allowing contouring in three planes. Used for [[pelvic fractures]] and distal humerus fractures.
*   **Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS):** A specialized plate and sliding screw system for [[intertrochanteric fractures]].

### Comparison of Plate Types

| Feature | Dynamic Compression Plate (DCP) | Locking Compression Plate (LCP) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Screw Head** | Standard (non-threaded head) | Threaded head locks into plate |
| **Stability** | Relies on friction between plate and bone | Does not rely on friction; Fixed-angle |
| **Periosteum** | Compressed (risk of necrosis) | Preserved (stands off bone) |
| **Reduction** | Needs anatomical reduction | Can be used for bridging (Biological) |
| **Indication** | Good bone stock, simple fractures | [[Osteoporosis]], Comminution, MIPO |
| **Healing** | Primary (Direct) Bone Healing | Secondary (Callus) or Primary |

### Surgical Techniques and Application

#### Biological Fixation (MIPO)
*   **MIPO:** [[Minimally Invasive Percutaneous Plate Osteosynthesis]].
*   **Concept:** The fracture is reduced indirectly without exposing the fracture site. A plate is slid submuscularly.
*   **Goal:** Preserves the fracture hematoma and soft tissue envelope.
*   **Healing:** Promotes **secondary bone healing** (callus formation) due to relative stability rather than absolute rigidity,.

#### Pre-bending Principle
*   When applying a straight plate to a curved bone, tightening the central screws can cause the far cortex to gap open.
*   **Technique:** The plate is slightly over-bent (more curved than the bone) before application. As screws are tightened, the far cortex is compressed first, ensuring uniform compression across the fracture surface.

#### Surgical Steps (General),
1.  **Exposure:** Appropriate approach (e.g., Henry's for radius).
2.  **Reduction:** Fracture fragments are reduced and held with bone clamps.
3.  **Plate Selection:** 5-6 holes minimum for simple fractures; longer for comminution.
4.  **Drilling:**
    *   Use **Neutral Guide** for the first screw near the fracture.
    *   Use **Eccentric Guide** (Arrow pointing to fracture) for the second screw to achieve compression.
5.  **Tapping:** Threads are cut into the bone (unless self-tapping screws are used).
6.  **Screw Insertion:** Screws are tightened to engage cortices.

### Complications of Plating

1.  **Infection:** Higher risk than closed nailing due to extensive dissection.
2.  **Implant Failure:** Plate breakage or screw pull-out if the fracture does not unite or if weight-bearing is premature.
3.  **Stress Shielding:** The rigid plate carries the load, depriving the underlying bone of physiologic stress (Wolff's Law). This causes **porosis** under the plate.
4.  **Refracture:** Can occur after plate removal due to the weakened/porotic bone at screw holes or stress risers.

### Clinical Implications
*   **Forearm Fractures:** Plates are the gold standard for [[both bone forearm fractures]] in adults to control rotation and restore length.
*   **Articular Fractures:** Plates (buttress) are essential to maintain the reduction of articular surfaces (e.g., [[tibial plateau]], [[pilon fracture]]).
*   **Pediatric Use:** Generally avoided to prevent growth plate injury, but used in specific scenarios like unstable femoral shaft fractures (submuscular plating).
