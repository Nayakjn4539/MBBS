# [[Firearms And Ballistics]] > structure of wound caused due to firearm

### **Structure of Firearm Wounds**

The structure of a wound caused by a firearm depends heavily on the type of weapon ([[Rifled Firearm]] vs. [[Shotgun]]), the ammunition used, and most importantly, the **range of fire**. These injuries are broadly classified into **Entry Wounds** (Entrance/In-shot) and **Exit Wounds** (Out-shot).

---

### **1. Entry Wounds (Rifled Firearms)**

The entry wound is created when the projectile penetrates the skin. Its appearance is modified by the discharge products accompanying the bullet (Flame, Smoke, Gunpowder particles).

#### **General Characteristics**
*   **Loss of Substance:** The wound is typically a circular or oval punched-out defect (tissue is missing, unlike a knife wound where tissue is merely separated).
*   **Inverted Edges:** The skin margins are pushed inward (invaginated) by the bullet.
*   **Dimension:** Usually smaller than the diameter of the bullet due to the elasticity of the skin (except in contact shots over bone).

#### **Specific Zones/Collars**
These are pathognomonic of entry wounds.

1.  **[[Grease Collar]] (Dirt Collar/Bullet Wipe):**
    *   A black, ring-like margin at the immediate edge of the hole.
    *   **Cause:** The bullet wipes off grease, lubricants, and lead oxide from its surface onto the skin as it enters.
    *   **Location:** The innermost ring.
    *   **Forensic Significance:** Proves it is an entry wound. Absent if the bullet has passed through intermediate targets (e.g., clothing, bone).

2.  **[[Abrasion Collar]] (Contusion Collar):**
    *   A reddish-brown, abraded zone surrounding the grease collar.
    *   **Cause:** The spinning bullet (gyroscopic action) rubs against and crushes the skin epidermis before perforating it.
    *   **Forensic Significance:**
        *   Confirms entry wound.
        *   **Direction of Fire:**
            *   *Concentric/Circular collar:* Fire was perpendicular (90°) to the skin.
            *   *Eccentric/Oval collar:* Fire was oblique; the collar is wider on the side from which the bullet came.

### **2. Variations Based on Range of Fire**

The presence of secondary discharge products determines the range.

| **Range** | **Distance** | **Key Features** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Contact Shot** | Muzzle touching skin | • **Muzzle Impression ([[Werkgartner's Mark]]):** An imprint of the gun muzzle due to heat and recoil.<br>• **Blow-back Effect:** Gas expansion causes stellate/cruciate tearing of skin (especially over bone like the skull).<br>• **Cherry Red Color:** Tissues in the track appear pink due to Carbon Monoxide (Carboxyhemoglobin formation).<br>• No external tattooing (soot/powder is driven *inside* the wound). |
| **Close Range** | Within flame reach (~6 inches) | • **Burning/Scorching:** Due to flame.<br>• **Singeing:** Burnt hair around the wound.<br>• **Cherry red musculature:** Due to CO. |
| **Near/Intermediate** | ~6 inches to 2-3 feet | • **[[Blackening]] (Smudging):** Deposit of smoke/soot. *Can be wiped off*.<br>• **[[Tattooing]] (Stippling/Peppering):** Unburnt powder grains embed into the skin causing punctate abrasions. *Cannot be wiped off*. |
| **Distant Range** | > 2-3 feet (Beyond powder reach) | • **Clean Wound:** Only the bullet hole, abrasion collar, and grease collar are visible.<br>• No burning, blackening, or tattooing.<br>• "Rat-hole" appearance may be seen in distant shotgun wounds. |

**Mnemonic for Range Effects:** **F-S-P**
*   **F**lame (Burning) – Closest
*   **S**moke (Blackening) – Intermediate
*   **P**owder (Tattooing) – Farthest of the residue

### **3. Shotgun Wounds (Smooth Bore)**

Shotguns fire multiple pellets. The wound structure depends on the **dispersion** of these pellets.

1.  **Contact/Close Range (up to ~1 meter):**
    *   En masse entry of pellets.
    *   Single, large circular hole with ragged edges.
    *   **Wads** (plastic/felt) are found *inside* the wound.
2.  **Intermediate Range (~1 to 3 meters):**
    *   Central hole has scalloped margins ("Rat-nibbled" appearance).
    *   Dispersion begins.
3.  **Distant Range (> 3-4 meters):**
    *   **Satellite Pellets:** Central hole disappears; individual pellets create separate small holes around the main area.
    *   No wads found in the wound (they fall off earlier).

---

### **4. Exit Wounds (Out-shot)**

These occur when the bullet leaves the body.

*   **Size:** Usually **larger** and more irregular than the entry wound (due to bullet deformation or tumbling).
*   **Edges:** **Everted** (turned outward).
*   **Absence:** No abrasion collar, grease collar, burning, blackening, or tattooing.
*   **Exception - [[Shored Exit Wound]]:** If the exit site is supported by a tight belt, wall, or floor, the skin is slapped against the support, creating a false abrasion collar. This mimics an entry wound.

**Comparison Table: Entry vs. Exit Wound**

| Feature | Entry Wound (Rifled) | Exit Wound |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Edges** | Inverted (turned in) | Everted (turned out) |
| **Size** | Smaller than/equal to bullet | Larger/Irregular |
| **Abrasion Collar** | **Present** (Pathognomonic) | Absent (except Shored exit) |
| **Grease Collar** | **Present** | Absent |
| **Powder/Soot** | Present (in close/near range) | Absent |
| **Tissue** | Loss of substance (Punched out) | No loss (Split/Torn) |

### **5. Firearm Wounds on Bone (Skull)**

Bone behaves like a brittle solid, aiding in determining direction.

1.  **Entry in Skull:**
    *   **Outer Table:** Clean, punched-out hole.
    *   **Inner Table:** Beveled/Cone-shaped defect (Internal Beveling). The hole is larger on the inside.
2.  **Exit in Skull:**
    *   **Inner Table:** Clean hole.
    *   **Outer Table:** Beveled/Cratered (External Beveling). The hole is larger on the outside.
3.  **[[Keyhole Defect]]:**
    *   Caused when a bullet strikes the skull tangentially.
    *   Shows features of both entry and exit in a single defect.

### **Medicolegal Aspects & Autopsy Findings**

*   **Nature of Death:**
    *   **Suicide:** Usually contact/close range. Common sites: Temple (60%), center of forehead, roof of mouth, left chest. Weapon usually found at the scene (cadaveric spasm may hold the gun).
    *   **Homicide:** Usually distant range. Multiple shots. Wound sites inaccessible to the victim.
*   **Identification of Weapon:**
    *   **Rifling marks** on the recovered bullet (Striations) are unique to the barrel (like a fingerprint).
    *   Caliber can be estimated from the entry wound size (roughly).
*   **Range and Direction:**
    *   Determined by tattooing density and abrasion collar eccentricity.
    *   **[[Kennedy Phenomenon]]:** Surgical alteration of a gunshot wound (e.g., suturing an entry wound) makes it look like a surgical incision, complicating medicolegal interpretation.
*   **X-Ray:** Mandatory in all firearm autopsies to locate the bullet, fragments, or estimate the angle of fire ("Lead snowstorm" appearance in high-velocity rounds).
