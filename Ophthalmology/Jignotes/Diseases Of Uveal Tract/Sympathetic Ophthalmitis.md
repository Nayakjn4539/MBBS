# [[Sympathetic Ophthalmitis]]

### Definition and Overview
[[Sympathetic Ophthalmitis]] (SO) is a rare, bilateral, granulomatous [[Panuveitis]] that occurs following a penetrating ocular trauma or surgery. It is a sight-threatening condition where injury to one eye leads to inflammation in the uninjured fellow eye.

*   **Exciting Eye:** The injured eye which incites the inflammation.
*   **Sympathizing Eye:** The non-injured fellow eye which develops uveitis.

### Etiology and Predisposing Factors
The condition is almost always associated with a perforating wound involving the incarceration of [[Uveal Tissue]].

*   **Penetrating Trauma:** Most common cause (65% of cases occur between 2 weeks and 3 months after injury).
*   **Dangerous Zone:** Wounds in the **ciliary region** (2–8 mm from the limbus) are the most prone to causing SO.
*   **Incarceration:** Wounds with incarceration of the [[Iris]], [[Ciliary Body]], or [[Lens Capsule]] are highly vulnerable.
*   **Absence of Suppuration:** SO does **not** occur if actual suppuration (purulent infection) develops in the injured eye.
*   **Surgical Trauma:** Rarely follows intraocular surgeries like cataract extraction, trabeculectomy, or vitreoretinal procedures.
*   **Age:** More common in children than in adults.

### Pathogenesis
The exact mechanism is not fully understood, but the accepted theory is **Autoimmune/Allergic**:
*   It is a **Type IV Hypersensitivity** reaction (Cell-mediated delayed hypersensitivity).
*   The [[Uveal Pigment]] or retinal antigens (S-antigen) act as an allergen/autoantigen, inciting a plastic uveitis in the sound eye.

### Pathology
The histopathology is characteristic of **Granulomatous Uveitis**.

*   **Diffuse Infiltration:** Nodular aggregation of lymphocytes, plasma cells, epithelioid cells, and giant cells scattered throughout the uveal tract.
*   **[[Dalen-Fuchs Nodules]]:** These are pathognomonic lesions. They consist of proliferation of the [[Retinal Pigment Epithelium]] (RPE) associated with invasion by lymphocytes and epithelioid cells. They are located between Bruch's membrane and the RPE.
*   **Sympathetic Perivasculitis:** The retina shows perivascular cellular infiltration (cuffing).
*   **Sparing of Choriocapillaris:** The choriocapillaris is usually spared from the granulomatous infiltration (unlike VKH syndrome).

### Clinical Features
The onset typically varies from **2 weeks to 1 year** after the injury.
*   **Minimum Interval:** Almost never occurs before **2 weeks** (safe period).
*   **Maximum Incidence:** 65% occur within 3 months; 90% within the first year.

#### 1. Exciting (Injured) Eye
Displays features of persistent low-grade plastic uveitis:
*   Ciliary congestion.
*   Lacrimation and tenderness.
*   Presence of [[Keratic Precipitates]] (KPs) on the back of the cornea (considered a dangerous sign).

#### 2. Sympathizing (Sound) Eye
Manifests usually as acute plastic [[Iridocyclitis]]. It presents in two stages:

**A. Prodromal Stage:**
Recognition of this stage is crucial for saving vision.
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Photophobia** (Sensitivity to light).
    *   **Lacrimation**.
    *   **Transient blurring of near vision:** This is due to the weakening of accommodation (paresis of the ciliary muscle) and is often the **first symptom**.
*   **Signs:**
    *   Retrolental flare and cells (earliest sign).
    *   Mild ciliary congestion and tenderness.
    *   A few fine KPs.
    *   Mild optic disc edema.

**B. Fully Developed Stage:**
If untreated, it progresses to severe granulomatous panuveitis.
*   **Anterior Segment:**
    *   Mutton-fat KPs.
    *   [[Koeppe Nodules]] (iris nodules).
    *   Posterior synechiae.
    *   Severe ciliary congestion.
*   **Posterior Segment:**
    *   **Dalen-Fuchs Nodules:** Small, deep, yellow-white spots scattered in the fundus.
    *   Vitreous haze/opacities.
    *   Papillitis (Optic nerve head edema).
    *   Exudative [[Retinal Detachment]] (rarely).
    *   Choroidal depigmentation (Sunset glow fundus) in chronic cases.

### Complications
If the inflammation is not controlled, it leads to:
1.  **Complicated [[Cataract]].**
2.  **Secondary [[Glaucoma]].**
3.  **[[Phthisis Bulbi]]** (Shrinkage and disorganization of the eyeball).

### Management

#### A. Prophylaxis (Prevention)
*   **Early Enucleation:** Excising the injured eye is the best prophylaxis if there is **no chance of saving useful vision**. This should ideally be done within **14 days (2 weeks)** of the injury to prevent sensitization.
*   **Wound Repair:** If there is visual potential, meticulous microsurgical repair of the wound should be done, ensuring no uveal tissue is incarcerated.
*   **Monitoring:** If the injured eye shows persistent inflammation (lacrimation, photophobia, KPs) after 2 weeks despite treatment, it should be excised immediately.

**Important Surgical Note:**
*   **[[Enucleation]]** is the surgery of choice.
*   **[[Evisceration]]** is **contraindicated** because leaving behind any uveal tissue or pigment can incite the immune reaction and fail to prevent SO.

#### B. Treatment of Established Sympathetic Ophthalmitis
Once SO has developed, enucleation of the exciting eye is controversial and usually only performed if the exciting eye is blind and painful; otherwise, it is retained as it may eventually have better vision than the sympathizing eye.

**1. Corticosteroids (Mainstay):**
*   Vigorous therapy by all routes: Topical, Periocular injections, and Systemic.
*   High doses are used initially and tapered very slowly over months to prevent relapse.

**2. Immunosuppressives:**
*   Indicated in severe cases resistant to steroids or where steroids are contraindicated.
*   **Drugs:** [[Cyclosporine]], Chlorambucil, Azathioprine, Methotrexate.

**3. Mydriatics:**
*   [[Atropine]] is used to rest the ciliary body and prevent synechiae.
