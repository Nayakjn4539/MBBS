# Facial Nerve Disorders: Anatomy, Diagnosis, and Management

## I. Applied Anatomy and Physiology
The [[Facial Nerve]] (CN VII) is a mixed nerve containing motor, sensory, and secretomotor fibers.

### Functional Components
*   **Special Visceral Efferent (Branchial Motor):** Supplies muscles of facial expression derived from the 2nd branchial arch (e.g., stapedius, stylohyoid, posterior belly of digastric).
*   **General Visceral Efferent (Parasympathetic):** Secretomotor fibers to the lacrimal gland, submandibular, and sublingual salivary glands.
*   **Special Visceral Afferent:** Taste sensation from the anterior 2/3 of the tongue via the [[Chorda Tympani]].
*   **General Somatic Afferent:** Cutaneous sensation from the concha and retroauricular skin.

### Course of the Facial Nerve
The nerve course is divided into three parts: Intracranial, Intratemporal, and Extracranial.

1.  **Intracranial:** Originates in the pons, hooks around the VI nerve nucleus, and enters the Internal Acoustic Meatus (IAM).
2.  **Intratemporal (within the Fallopian Canal):**
    *   **Meatal Segment:** Within the IAM.
    *   **Labyrinthine Segment:** Shortest and narrowest segment; extends to the [[Geniculate Ganglion]] (1st Genu). This site is most prone to compression (e.g., Bell's palsy).
    *   **Tympanic (Horizontal) Segment:** Runs above the oval window. **Clinical Implication:** This is the most common site for congenital bony dehiscence, making the nerve vulnerable during surgery or infection.
    *   **Mastoid (Vertical) Segment:** Runs from the second genu to the stylomastoid foramen.
3.  **Extracranial:** Exits via the stylomastoid foramen, enters the parotid gland, and divides into terminal branches (Pes Anserinus): Temporal, Zygomatic, Buccal, Mandibular, and Cervical.

## II. Pathophysiology of Nerve Injury
Understanding the degree of injury aids in prognosis. The **Sunderland Classification** is widely accepted.

| Degree | Pathology | Anatomical Damage | Recovery Prognosis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1st (Neurapraxia)** | Conduction block | No structural damage; axon intact | Complete recovery |
| **2nd (Axonotmesis)** | Axon loss | Endoneurium intact | Good recovery |
| **3rd** | Neurotmesis | Endoneurium injured | Incomplete; Synkinesis likely |
| **4th** | Partial transection | Perineurium injured | Poor; scarring impairs regeneration |
| **5th** | Complete transection | Epineurium injured | No recovery without repair |

## III. Clinical Evaluation and Diagnosis

### 1. Localization of Lesion
Differentiating between Upper Motor Neuron (UMN) and Lower Motor Neuron (LMN) lesions is the first step.

*   **Central (UMN) Lesion:** Paralysis of the *contralateral* lower face only. The forehead is spared due to bilateral cortical innervation.
*   **Peripheral (LMN) Lesion:** Paralysis of the *ipsilateral* entire face (upper and lower). Patient cannot frown, close the eye, or purse lips.

### 2. Topodiagnostic Tests
These tests localize the site of injury within the intratemporal course.

| Test | Mechanism | Interpretation (Site of Lesion) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Schirmer Test** | Measures lacrimation (filter paper in lower fornix) | Reduced lacrimation indicates a lesion proximal to the [[Geniculate Ganglion]] (origin of Greater Superficial Petrosal Nerve). |
| **Stapedial Reflex** | Tested via tympanometry | Absence indicates a lesion proximal to the nerve to the stapedius. |
| **Taste Test (Electrogustometry)** | Taste on anterior 2/3 of tongue | Impaired taste indicates a lesion proximal to the origin of the [[Chorda Tympani]]. |
| **Submandibular Salivary Flow** | Cannulation of Wharton's duct | Reduced salivation indicates a lesion proximal to the [[Chorda Tympani]]. |

### 3. Grading of Paralysis
The **House-Brackmann Grading System** is the standard for reporting severity.

*   **Grade I:** Normal function.
*   **Grade II:** Mild dysfunction (slight weakness, complete eye closure).
*   **Grade III:** Moderate dysfunction (obvious weakness, complete eye closure with effort).
*   **Grade IV:** Moderately severe (incomplete eye closure).
*   **Grade V:** Severe dysfunction (barely perceptible motion).
*   **Grade VI:** Total paralysis.

### 4. Electrophysiological Tests
Used to determine prognosis and need for surgical decompression.
*   **Electroneuronography (ENoG):** Measures muscle action potentials. >90% degeneration within 14 days indicates a poor prognosis and may necessitate decompression.
*   **Electromyography (EMG):** Useful after 3 weeks. Fibrillation potentials indicate denervation; polyphasic potentials indicate regeneration.

### 5. Imaging
*   **HRCT Temporal Bone:** Best for trauma (fractures) and bony erosion (cholesteatoma).
*   **MRI with Gadolinium:** Best for tumors (schwannoma), inflammation (Bell's palsy), and intracranial pathology.

## IV. Specific Disorders of the Facial Nerve

### A. Bell's Palsy (Idiopathic Facial Paralysis)
This is the most common cause of peripheral facial paralysis.

*   **Etiology:** Likely viral reactivation (HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV), leading to inflammation and vascular ischemia/edema within the narrow fallopian canal (entrapment neuropathy).
*   **Risk Factors:** Diabetes, pregnancy, hypertension.
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Sudden onset unilateral LMN palsy.
    *   **Bell’s Phenomenon:** Eyeball turns up and out when attempting to close the eye.
    *   Hyperacusis (stapedius palsy), loss of taste, post-auricular pain.
    *   Epiphora (tearing) due to loss of lid function/pumping action.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Medical:** Steroids (Prednisolone) are the mainstay (start within 72 hours). Antivirals (Acyclovir/Valacyclovir) may be added.
    *   **Eye Care:** Lubrication, taping eye shut at night to prevent exposure keratitis.
    *   **Surgical:** Decompression if >90% degeneration on ENoG within 2 weeks.
*   **Prognosis:** 85-90% recover completely.

### B. Ramsay Hunt Syndrome (Herpes Zoster Oticus)
Caused by reactivation of Varicella Zoster Virus in the [[Geniculate Ganglion]].
*   **Triad:** Facial paralysis + Vesicular rash (concha/EAC/palate) + Vestibulocochlear dysfunction (hearing loss/vertigo).
*   **Prognosis:** Worse than Bell's palsy. Fewer than 50% achieve complete recovery.
*   **Treatment:** Steroids + Antivirals.

### C. Trauma
*   **Temporal Bone Fractures:**
    *   **Longitudinal:** More common (80%), fracture line parallel to petrous ridge. Facial palsy is less common (20%) and usually delayed/incomplete.
    *   **Transverse:** Less common (20%), fracture line perpendicular to petrous ridge. Facial palsy is common (50%) and usually immediate/complete due to nerve transection.
    *   *Mnemonic:* **T**ransverse fracture **T**raumatizes the facial nerve; **L**ongitudinal fracture **L**eaves it.
*   **Surgical Trauma:** Occurs during mastoidectomy (2nd genu is most common site) or parotidectomy.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Delayed onset:** Conservative (steroids).
    *   **Immediate onset:** Surgical exploration and repair (end-to-end anastomosis or cable graft using Greater Auricular or Sural nerve).

### D. Infection
*   **Acute Otitis Media (AOM):** Palsy caused by pressure on a dehiscent nerve. Treatment: IV antibiotics + Myringotomy.
*   **Chronic Otitis Media (CSOM):** Caused by bone erosion (cholesteatoma) or granulation tissue. Treatment: Urgent mastoidectomy.
*   **Malignant Otitis Externa:** Skull base osteomyelitis involving CN VII. Seen in elderly diabetics. Treatment: Anti-pseudomonal antibiotics.

### E. Tumors
*   **Facial Nerve Schwannoma:** Can occur anywhere along the nerve. Clinical suspicion: Slowly progressive palsy or recurrent palsy.
*   **Parotid Malignancy:** Facial paralysis in a parotid mass usually indicates malignancy.

### F. Other Syndromes
*   **Melkersson-Rosenthal Syndrome:** Triad of recurrent facial palsy, fissured tongue, and lip swelling (cheilitis granulomatosa).
*   **Heerfordt’s Syndrome (Uveoparotid Fever):** Sarcoidosis presenting with bilateral parotid enlargement, facial palsy, and uveitis.
*   **Mobius Syndrome:** Congenital bilateral facial palsy + abducens palsy.

## V. Complications of Aberrant Regeneration
Following nerve injury (3rd degree or higher), regenerating fibers may reach the wrong target.

1.  **Synkinesis:** Involuntary movement of one muscle group during voluntary movement of another (e.g., eye closure when smiling).
2.  **Crocodile Tears (Gustatory Lacrimation):** Salivary fibers (parasympathetic) aberrantly reinnervate the lacrimal gland. Tearing occurs during eating. **Treatment:** Botulinum toxin injection into the lacrimal gland.
3.  **Frey’s Syndrome (Gustatory Sweating):** Following parotid surgery, parasympathetic fibers of the auriculotemporal nerve aberrantly reinnervate sweat glands of the skin. Sweating/flushing occurs over the parotid area while eating. **Diagnosis:** Minor's Starch Iodine Test. **Treatment:** Topical antiperspirants, Botulinum toxin, or Tympanic neurectomy.
