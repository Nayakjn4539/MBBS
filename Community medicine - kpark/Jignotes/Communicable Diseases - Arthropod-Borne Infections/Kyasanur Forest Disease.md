# Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD)

**Synonyms:** [[Monkey Fever]], Monkey Disease.

**Definition:** KFD is a tick-borne viral hemorrhagic fever endemic to the Karnataka state in India. It was first identified in 1957 in the Kyasanur Forest of Shimoga district.

### 1. Epidemiological Determinants

**A. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** [[KFD virus]] (KFDV).
*   **Family:** Flaviviridae (Genus: *Flavivirus*). Formerly classified as Group B Arbovirus/Togavirus.
*   **Group:** It belongs to the Russian Spring-Summer Encephalitis (RSSE) complex.
*   **Biosafety Level:** It is a Biosafety Level 4 pathogen.

**B. Host Factors**
*   **Reservoir Hosts:** Small mammals like [[rats]], [[squirrels]] (porcupines), and shrews. They maintain the virus in nature.
*   **Amplifying Hosts:** [[Monkeys]] (specifically the Black-faced Langur and Red-faced Bonnet monkey).
    *   *Clinical Relevance:* Monkey deaths are often the first sign of an outbreak (Sentinels). Hence, it is called "Monkey Disease".
*   **Maintenance Host for Vectors:** Cattle. They provide blood meals for ticks causing a population explosion of vectors but play *no part* in virus maintenance.
*   **Accidental/Dead-end Host:** Man. Humans do not play a role in transmission (No human-to-human spread).
*   **Risk Group:** Forest workers, cultivators, and those gathering firewood (Occupational hazard).

**C. Environmental Factors**
*   **Season:** Epidemics usually coincide with the dry months (January to June) which correlates with human activity in forests and peak [[nymphal activity]] of ticks.
*   **Location:** Endemic in districts of Karnataka (Shimoga, North/South Kannada, Chikamagaluru) and adjoining areas.

### 2. Vector and Transmission

*   **Vector:** Hard Ticks of the genus **[[Haemaphysalis]]**.
    *   **Specific Species:** *Haemaphysalis spinigera* (Main vector), *H. turtura*.
*   **Infective Stage:** Nymphal stage of the tick (most active human biters).
*   **Mode of Transmission:**
    *   **Bite:** Bite of an infective tick (usually a nymph).
    *   **Contact:** Handling infected animals (monkeys/rodents).
*   **Vector Dynamics:**
    *   **Transstadial Transmission:** Infection passes from Larva $\rightarrow$ Nymph $\rightarrow$ Adult.
    *   **Transovarian Transmission:** Infected female ticks pass the virus to their eggs (Vertical transmission).

### 3. Incubation Period
*   Usually **3 to 8 days**.

### 4. Clinical Picture (Biphasic Course)

**Phase I: Acute Febrile/Hemorrhagic Phase (Lasts ~2 weeks)**
*   Sudden onset of high fever, frontal headache, and severe myalgia (prostration).
*   **Hemorrhagic manifestations:** Bleeding from nose (epistaxis), gums, stomach, and intestines.
*   Hypotension and hepatosplenomegaly.
*   *Note:* The patient may recover or progress to Phase II after an afebrile period of 7–21 days.

**Phase II: Meningoencephalitic Phase**
*   Return of fever.
*   Signs of [[meningoencephalitis]]: Severe headache, neck rigidity, mental disturbance, coarse tremors, and abnormal reflexes.
*   **Case Fatality Rate:** 5% to 10%.

### 5. Diagnosis
*   **Early Stage (Viremia):** Isolation of virus from blood (inoculation in mice/cell culture).
*   **Serology:** IgM/IgG ELISA, Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI), Complement Fixation (CF).
*   **Molecular:** RT-PCR.
*   **Blood Picture:** Leukopenia (low WBC) and Thrombocytopenia (low platelets).

### 6. Treatment
*   There is **no specific antiviral** treatment.
*   **Supportive Care:** Management of hydration, electrolytes, and bleeding diathesis.
*   Analgesics for pain and fever (Avoid Aspirin due to bleeding risk).

### 7. Prevention and Control

**A. Vector Control (Tick Control)**
*   **Insecticides:** Application of propoxur, fenthion, or carbaryl.
*   **Hot Spots:** Spraying is done within a **50-meter radius** around the spot of a monkey death.
*   **Source Reduction:** Controlling rodent populations and restricting cattle movement in forest areas to reduce tick feeding sources.

**B. Vaccination**
*   **Vaccine:** Formalin-killed KFD vaccine (Tissue culture vaccine).
*   **Schedule:**
    *   Primary course: Two doses at an interval of 1 month.
    *   Booster: After 6–9 months.
    *   Subsequent boosters: Every 5 years.
*   **Target:** Villagers within 5 km of infected foci and forest workers.

**C. Personal Protection**
*   Use of insect repellents (DEET, DMP).
*   Protective clothing (long sleeves, covering legs) while entering forests.
*   Self-examination for ticks after leaving the forest.

### Mnemonics to Remember

**KFD** characteristics:
*   **K** - **K**arnataka (Origin/Endemic)
*   **F** - **F**lavivirus / **F**orest workers at risk
*   **D** - **D**ead-end host is man / **D**ouble phase fever (Biphasic)

**Vector:**
*   **H**aemaphysalis **S**pinigera = **H**igh **S**peed tick (Rapid spread in monkeys)
