# [[Firearms And Ballistics]] > External Ballistics

### External Ballistics

[[External ballistics]], also known as **Intermediate Ballistics**, is the branch of science dealing with the motion of the [[projectile]] (bullet/pellet) after it leaves the muzzle of the firearm until it hits the target. It involves the study of the trajectory, velocity, air resistance, and gravitational pull affecting the bullet in flight.

The behavior of the bullet during this phase determines the nature of the [[entry wound]] and is crucial for estimating the range of fire.

### Factors Affecting Projectile Flight

The flight of a bullet is not a straight line but a parabolic curve due to various forces:
1.  **Muzzle Velocity:** The speed at which the bullet leaves the barrel.
2.  **Gravity:** Pulls the bullet downwards, creating a curved trajectory.
3.  **Air Resistance (Drag):** Slows down the bullet.
4.  **Drift:** Deviation of the bullet from the line of sight due to the spinning motion (gyroscopic action) imparted by [[rifling]].
5.  **Yawing and Tumbling:** Instability in flight.

### Abnormalities of Bullet Motion

During external ballistics, bullets may undergo specific motions that significantly alter the wound characteristics.

#### 1. Yawing
*   **Definition:** It is the oscillation of the bullet around its longitudinal axis. The tip of the bullet deviates from the line of flight.
*   **Occurrence:** It is most pronounced immediately after the bullet leaves the muzzle (before gyroscopic stability takes over) and again when it enters the target (tissue).
*   **Medicolegal Significance:** A yawing bullet presents a larger surface area to the target, causing a larger, irregular entrance wound (often oval or oblique) even if fired from a distance.

#### 2. Tumbling
*   **Definition:** The end-over-end rotation of the bullet (somersaulting).
*   **Cause:** Occurs when the bullet loses its gyroscopic stability, usually at the end of its trajectory or after hitting an intermediate object (ricochet).
*   **Medicolegal Significance:** Produces a **keyhole defect** (entrance wound looking like a keyhole) because the bullet strikes the target sideways.

#### 3. Ricochet
*   **Definition:** The glancing rebound of a projectile after hitting an intermediate surface (e.g., ground, wall, bone) before striking the target.
*   **Critical Angle:** The angle of impact determines if the bullet will penetrate or ricochet.
*   **Medicolegal Significance:**
    *   The bullet becomes deformed/flattened.
    *   It loses stability (tumbles).
    *   **Wound Character:** Causes a large, irregular, cruciate, or ovoid entry wound that mimics a close-range shotgun wound or a high-velocity injury.
    *   **Range estimation error:** Ricochet bullets do not carry gunpowder residue, so a distant shot might be misinterpreted, or the irregular wound might be mistaken for a near-contact shot.

### Components of Discharge (Range of Fire)

In external ballistics, the material exiting the muzzle alongside the bullet helps determine the **range of fire**. As the distance increases, these components drop off in a specific sequence.

| Component | Characteristics | Medicolegal Finding on Body/Clothes | Approximate Range |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Flame** | Hot gases and burning powder. | **Singeing/Scorching:** Burnt hair, burnt clothes. | Very Close (Contact to ~15 cm) |
| **Smoke** | Soot/Carbon particles. Light, does not travel far. | **Blackening/Smudging:** Superficial carbon deposit. Can be wiped off. | Close (~30-45 cm) |
| **Gunpowder** | Unburnt/semi-burnt particles. Heavier than smoke. | **Tattooing/Stippling:** Particles embedded in skin. Cannot be wiped off. Ante-mortem sign. | Near/Intermediate (~60-100 cm) |
| **Projectile** | The bullet itself. | **Abrasion Collar:** Grease collar + mechanical abrasion. | Distant (> 1 meter) |

> **Mnemonic for Range of Fire Sequence:**
> **F**ire **S**mokes **P**owder **B**adly
> *   **F**ire (Flame/Singeing) – Closest
> *   **S**moke (Blackening)
> *   **P**owder (Tattooing)
> *   **B**ullet (Abrasion collar only) – Distant

### Special External Ballistic Phenomena

#### 1. Tandem Bullet (Piggyback Bullet)
*   **Scenario:** A bullet gets stuck in the barrel (due to defect or old ammunition). A second shot is fired, pushing the first bullet out. Both bullets travel together or hit the target sequentially.
*   **Autopsy Finding:** Two bullets may be found in the body with only one entrance wound, or two entrance wounds from a single discharge sound.

#### 2. Kennedy Phenomenon
*   **Definition:** Surgical alteration or suturing of a gunshot wound that distorts its appearance, making it difficult to distinguish between an entry and exit wound during [[autopsy]].

#### 3. Billiard Ball Ricochet Effect
*   **Scenario:** In [[shotgun]] injuries, widely dispersed pellets may strike an intermediate object and bunch together again before hitting the victim.
*   **Result:** A distant shot may mimic a close-range shot (smaller spread).

### Medicolegal Aspects of External Ballistics

1.  **Range Determination:** The presence of singeing, blackening, or tattooing is the most reliable method to determine distance.
2.  **Direction of Fire:** Can be ascertained by the shape of the abrasion collar (concentric vs. eccentric) and the distribution of tattooing (if the gun is angled, tattooing is elliptical).
3.  **Nature of Weapon:** Rifled weapons impart spin (external ballistics) leading to accurate, circular wounds. Smoothbore weapons (shotguns) result in pellet dispersion over distance.
4.  **Recovery of Projectile:** Careful handling of the recovered bullet is essential to preserve rifling marks (striations) acquired during internal ballistics, which are crucial for linking the bullet to a specific gun.
