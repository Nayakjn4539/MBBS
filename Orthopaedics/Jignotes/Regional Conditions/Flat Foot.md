# [[Regional Conditions]] > Flat Foot

### Flat Foot (Pes Planus)

**Definition**
[[Pes planus]], commonly known as **flat foot**, is a deformity characterized by the loss or collapse of the [[medial longitudinal arch]] of the foot. In this condition, the medial border of the foot comes in contact (or nearly in contact) with the ground. It is often a complex deformity involving the hindfoot, midfoot, and forefoot.

**Pathomechanics and Components**
The deformity is rarely just a "flat arch." It typically involves a tri-planar malalignment:
1.  **Hindfoot:** [[Valgus deformity]] (Heel eversion).
2.  **Midfoot:** Collapse of the medial longitudinal arch (Sagging of the [[talonavicular joint]]).
3.  **Forefoot:** Abduction and Supination relative to the hindfoot.
4.  **Soft Tissues:** Tightness or contracture of the [[tendo-Achilles]] (Equinus) is frequently associated.

> **Clinical Implication:** In infants and toddlers, the longitudinal arch is usually not visible due to a fat pad and ligamentous laxity. This is **Physiological Flat Foot** and usually resolves by age 4–6 years as the arch develops.

### Classification

Flat foot can be broadly classified based on etiology or flexibility.

#### 1. Based on Flexibility
*   **Flexible Flat Foot:** The arch is absent on weight-bearing but reappears when the patient stands on tiptoes or when the foot is non-weight bearing. This is usually asymptomatic.
*   **Rigid Flat Foot:** The arch is absent in all positions. This is often pathological and painful (e.g., [[Tarsal coalition]], [[Congenital vertical talus]]).

#### 2. Etiological Classification

| Category | Specific Causes |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Congenital** | • **Physiological:** Generalized ligament laxity (most common).<br>• **Congenital Vertical Talus (CVT):** Also called "Rocker Bottom Foot" (Rigid).<br>• **Tarsal Coalition:** Fusion of tarsal bones (Spasmodic flat foot). |
| **Acquired** | • **Static/Postural:** Obesity, prolonged standing, poor footwear.<br>• **Traumatic:** Malunited fracture of [[calcaneum]] or [[talus]].<br>• **Paralytic:** Polio (weakness of tibialis posterior), [[Cerebral Palsy]].<br>• **Inflammatory:** [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]] (destruction of ligaments).<br>• **Tendon Dysfunction:** [[Tibialis Posterior Tendon Dysfunction]] (common in adults). |

### Clinical Features

**Symptoms**
*   **Asymptomatic:** Many patients, especially children with flexible flat foot, have no complaints.
*   **Pain:** Along the medial border of the foot (strain on ligaments) or lateral aspect (impingement of calcaneus against fibula).
*   **Fatigue:** Easily tired legs and feet after standing or walking.
*   **Shoe wear:** Rapid wearing out of the medial side of the shoe sole.
*   **Gait:** The patient may walk with a clumsy or non-springy gait.

**Signs (Look, Feel, Move)**
*   **Inspection (Standing):**
    *   Loss of the medial arch; the foot looks pronated.
    *   **Heel Valgus:** Viewed from behind, the heel points outward.
    *   **"Too Many Toes" Sign:** When viewed from behind, more toes are visible on the lateral side due to forefoot abduction (typical in Tibialis Posterior insufficiency).
*   **Assessment of Flexibility:**
    *   **Tip-Toe Test:** Ask the patient to stand on toes. If the heel varus returns and the arch reforms, it is a **flexible** flat foot. If the heel remains in valgus, it is **rigid**.
    *   **Jack’s Test (Windlass Mechanism):** Passive dorsiflexion of the great toe should restore the arch in a flexible foot.
*   **Palpation:**
    *   Tenderness over the [[talonavicular joint]] or along the tibialis posterior tendon.
    *   Check for tarsal coalition (restricted subtalar motion).
*   **Shoe Inspection:** Look for oblique wear on the inner side of the sole and heel.

### Special Clinical Conditions

#### 1. Peroneal Spastic Flat Foot (Tarsal Coalition)
*   **Definition:** A rigid flat foot caused by a fibrous, cartilaginous, or bony bar connecting two tarsal bones.
*   **Common sites:** [[Calcaneonavicular bar]] or [[Talocalcaneal bar]].
*   **Mechanism:** The subtalar joint motion is restricted. The peroneal muscles go into spasm to prevent painful inversion.
*   **Clinical Feature:** Painful, rigid flat foot in an adolescent. The foot is held in eversion.

#### 2. Congenital Vertical Talus (Rocker Bottom Foot)
*   **Definition:** A rare, rigid congenital deformity where the talus is vertically oriented and the [[navicular]] is dislocated dorsally onto the neck of the talus.
*   **Appearance:** The sole is convex (rocker bottom). The heel is in valgus and equinus.
*   **Treatment:** Requires surgical correction (open reduction and pinning).

#### 3. Tibialis Posterior Dysfunction
*   **Population:** Usually middle-aged women.
*   **Pathology:** Degeneration or rupture of the [[tibialis posterior tendon]] (the primary dynamic stabilizer of the arch).
*   **Signs:** Inability to perform a single-limb heel rise.

### Investigations

1.  **Plain X-rays (Weight-bearing AP and Lateral):**
    *   **Lateral View:**
        *   **Meary’s Angle (Talo-1st Metatarsal Angle):** Normally 0°. In flat foot, the line through the talus passes below the 1st metatarsal (sagging).
        *   **Calcaneal Pitch:** Decreased (< 20°).
    *   **AP View:** Increased talocalcaneal angle (divergence of talus and calcaneus > 35°).
2.  **CT Scan:** Best for diagnosing [[tarsal coalition]] (bony bars).
3.  **MRI:** Best for assessing soft tissues, specifically the integrity of the [[tibialis posterior tendon]] and ligaments (Spring ligament).
4.  **Harris Mat / Podogram:** To record footprints for documentation.

### Treatment

#### 1. Conservative Management
Indicated for flexible, asymptomatic, or mild symptomatic cases.
*   **Observation:** For physiologic flat foot in children < 3 years.
*   **Footwear Modifications:**
    *   **Thomas Heel:** A medial heel wedge (3/16 inch) extended anteriorly to support the arch.
    *   **Medial Arch Support:** Insoles (Rose’s insole) or molded arch supports.
    *   **Sturdy Shoes:** Shoes with a firm heel counter.
*   **Exercises:**
    *   Picking up marbles with toes (to strengthen intrinsic muscles).
    *   Walking on outer borders of feet.
    *   Stretching of the [[tendo-Achilles]] (if contracture is present).
*   **Activity Modification & Analgesics:** For acute pain.

#### 2. Surgical Management
Indicated for rigid flat foot, painful flexible flat foot resistant to conservative care, or severe deformity.

**Procedures:**
*   **Soft Tissue Procedures:**
    *   Tendon transfers (e.g., FDL transfer for Tibialis Posterior dysfunction).
    *   Lengthening of [[tendo-Achilles]] or gastrocnemius recession.
    *   Plication of the [[spring ligament]].
*   **Bony Procedures:**
    *   **Calcaneal Osteotomy:** Medializing calcaneal osteotomy (shifts the heel varus to restore mechanics).
    *   **Lateral Column Lengthening:** (e.g., Evans osteotomy) to correct forefoot abduction.
    *   **Arthroereisis:** Insertion of a spacer implant into the sinus tarsi to block excessive eversion (controversial).
    *   **Triple Arthrodesis:** Fusion of subtalar, talonavicular, and calcaneocuboid joints. Indicated for severe, rigid, painful deformities with arthritis (Salvage procedure).
*   **Excision of Coalition:** For tarsal coalition (if no degenerative changes are present).
