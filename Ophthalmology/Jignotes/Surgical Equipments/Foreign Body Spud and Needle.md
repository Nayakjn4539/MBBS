# Foreign Body Spud and Needle

In the context of [[Ophthalmic Surgery]] and emergency eye care, the **Foreign Body Spud** and **Foreign Body Needle** are essential handheld instruments used primarily for the removal of superficial and embedded [[Extraocular Foreign Bodies]].

### 1. Foreign Body Spud

#### Description
*   **Structure:** It consists of a handle attached to a small, stout, and flat metallic blade.
*   **Tip Configuration:** The tip is typically **blunt** or slightly rounded.
*   **Edges:** It has edges on both sides, but they are generally not razor-sharp, allowing for a scooping action rather than cutting.
*   **Design Purpose:** Designed to dislodge foreign bodies that are loosely adherent or superficially embedded without penetrating the [[Corneal Stroma]].

#### Uses
*   **Removal of Corneal Foreign Body:** Primary instrument for removing superficial particles (e.g., dust, coal, wings of insects) lodged in the [[Corneal Epithelium]] or [[Bowman's Membrane]].
*   **Removal of Conjunctival Foreign Body:** Used to lift foreign bodies from the [[Bulbar Conjunctiva]] or [[Sulcus Subtarsalis]].

### 2. Foreign Body Needle

#### Description
*   **Instrument:** Often a sterile, disposable **Hypodermic Needle** (typically 26 Gauge or insulin needle) attached to a syringe (acting as a handle) is used.
*   **Tip Configuration:** Extremely sharp, beveled point.
*   **Design Purpose:** Designed to pick out or lift foreign bodies that are deeply impacted or embedded where a blunt spud cannot get purchase (grip).

#### Uses
*   **Impacted Foreign Bodies:** Used when the foreign body is embedded in the [[Corneal Stroma]] and cannot be dislodged by a cotton swab or a blunt spud.
*   **Rust Ring Removal:** The tip can be used to gently scrape away residual rust rings (though a rotary burr is preferred for extensive rust).

### Comparison: Spud vs. Needle

| Feature | Foreign Body Spud | Foreign Body Needle |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tip** | Blunt, flat, shovel-like | Sharp, pointed, beveled |
| **Safety** | Higher safety profile (less risk of perforation) | Higher risk of [[Corneal Perforation]] if mishandled |
| **Indication** | Superficial, loosely adherent bodies | Deeply embedded or impacted bodies |
| **Action** | Scooping / Dislodging | Picking / Levering out |

### Procedure for Foreign Body Removal

The removal of a [[Corneal Foreign Body]] is an outpatient procedure performed under magnification.

#### Prerequisites
1.  **Anaesthesia:** Topical installation of **2% to 4% [[Xylocaine]]**, **0.5% [[Proparacaine]]**, or **1% [[Amethocaine]]**.
2.  **Magnification:** Ideally performed on a [[Slit Lamp Biomicroscope]]. In field settings, [[Oblique Illumination]] with a loupe may be used.
3.  **Patient Position:** Supine (on an examination table) or seated at the slit lamp. Head must be stabilized.

#### Steps
1.  **Assessment:** Locate the foreign body and assess depth (to rule out intraocular penetration).
2.  **First Line (Swab):** Attempt to wipe the foreign body away with a moist cotton swab stick.
3.  **Second Line (Spud/Needle):**
    *   If the swab fails, use the **Foreign Body Spud** or **Needle**.
    *   The instrument is held tangent to the cornea (never perpendicular to avoid perforation).
    *   The tip is inserted gently under the edge of the foreign body to lift it out of the corneal tissue.
    *   **Specific for Needle:** Extra care is taken to avoid entering the [[Anterior Chamber]]. If the foreign body is magnetic and deep, a hand-held magnet may be used.
4.  **Post-Procedure:**
    *   **Antibiotic Ointment:** Applied to prevent secondary [[Bacterial Corneal Ulcer]].
    *   **Patching:** An eye patch is applied for 24–48 hours to facilitate epithelial healing.
    *   **Cycloplegics:** [[Atropine]] or [[Homatropine]] may be used to relieve ciliary spasm and pain.

### Clinical Implications

*   **Rust Rings:** If the foreign body is metallic (iron), it may leave a **[[Siderosis]]/Rust Ring**. This must be removed either immediately or after 24–48 hours when the surrounding stroma softens, allowing easier removal with a needle or spud.
*   **Corneal Ulceration:** Improper use of the needle or spud can cause iatrogenic damage to the [[Bowman's Membrane]], leading to permanent [[Corneal Opacity]] (Nebula/Macula).
*   **Perforation Risk:** In uncooperative patients or children, the use of a sharp needle carries a high risk of globe perforation; general anesthesia or deep sedation may be required.
