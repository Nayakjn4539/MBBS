### Functions of the World Health Organization (WHO)

The **World Health Organization (WHO)** is a specialized, non-political health agency of the United Nations. Its primary objective is the **"attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health"**,.

    *   **Surveillance:** WHO collects and disseminates epidemiological information on diseases subject to **International Health Regulations (IHR)** (e.g., Cholera, Plague, Yellow Fever) and others of international importance via the **Weekly Epidemiological Record (WER)**,.
    *   **Immunization:** The [[Expanded Programme on Immunization]] (EPI) is a priority, targeting common childhood diseases.
*   **Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs):**
    *   Focuses on problems such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and genetic disorders.
    *   Addresses vector biology, immunology, and quality control of drugs.

*   It assists countries in improving medical records and national health information systems.

#### 6. Biomedical Research
*   WHO **does not** conduct research itself but **stimulates, coordinates, and funds** research work,,.

### Clinical Relevance
**Notification of Diseases:** Clinicians must be aware that certain diseases (Cholera, Plague, Yellow Fever, Smallpox, Wild Polio, Human Influenza, SARS) are notifiable to the WHO under [[International Health Regulations]]. Failure to notify can lead to international spread of epidemics. WHO uses this data to issue travel advisories and global alerts.
