# Rabies (Hydrophobia)

Rabies is a rapidly progressive, acute viral infection of the central nervous system (encephalomyelitis) that is practically **100% fatal** once clinical symptoms appear. It is a major **[[Zoonotic Disease]]** transmitted from animals to humans.

### 1. Epidemiological Determinants

#### Agent Factors
*   **Agent:** [[Lyssavirus type 1]] (Family: Rhabdoviridae).
*   **Structure:** Bullet-shaped, negative-sense **ssRNA** virus.
*   **Resistance:** Killed by sunlight, heat, and standard disinfectants (soap, ethanol, iodine).
*   **Virus Types:**
    *   **Street Virus:** Freshly isolated from natural cases. Variable incubation period (20-60 days). Pathogenic to all mammals. Produces **[[Negri Bodies]]**.
    *   **Fixed Virus:** Laboratory modified (serial brain-to-brain passage). Fixed/short incubation (4-6 days). Used for **vaccine production**. Does *not* form Negri bodies.

#### Host Factors
*   **Natural Host:** Warm-blooded animals. In India, **Dogs** are responsible for 99% of human cases (Urban Rabies).
*   **Dead End Host:** **Man** is a dead-end host (infection does not spread from man to man/animals usually).
*   **High Risk Group:** Children (5–14 years), males, veterinarians, dog catchers.

#### Environmental Factors
*   **Rabies Free Areas:** Australia, New Zealand, Japan, UK.
*   **In India:** [[Lakshadweep]] and [[Andaman & Nicobar Islands]] are rabies-free.

### 2. Transmission Dynamics

*   **Mode of Transmission:**
    1.  **Animal Bite:** Deep bite or scratch (Most common).
    2.  **Licks:** On abraded skin or mucous membranes (eyes, mouth).
    3.  **Aerosols:** In bat caves (rare).
    4.  **Transplantation:** Corneal or organ transplants (rare person-to-person).
    *   *Note: Ingestion of raw meat or milk from rabid animals is NOT a confirmed source of human infection.*

*   **Incubation Period (IP):**
    *   **Variable:** Typically **3–8 weeks** (Range: 4 days to years).
    *   **Determinants of IP:**
        *   Site of bite (Distance from brain: Head/Neck bites have shorter IP).
        *   Severity of wound (Richness of nerve supply).
        *   Viral load injected.

### 3. Pathogenesis and Clinical Picture

*   **Pathogenesis:** Virus replicates in muscle $\rightarrow$ Enters peripheral nerves $\rightarrow$ Moves centripetally to CNS $\rightarrow$ Rapid multiplication in Brain $\rightarrow$ Moves centrifugally to salivary glands (making saliva infectious).

*   **Clinical Features:**
    1.  **Prodromal Phase:** Fever, malaise, and **tingling/pain at the site of the bite** (specific symptom).
    2.  **Acute Neurologic Phase:**
        *   **[[Hydrophobia]]:** Fear of water. Spasms of pharyngeal muscles upon seeing/trying to drink water. **Pathognomonic**.
        *   **Aerophobia:** Fear of air drafts precipitating spasms.
        *   Excitation, hallucinations, aggression.
    3.  **Coma and Death:** Usually within 2–6 days of symptom onset due to respiratory paralysis.

*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   **Clinical:** History of bite + Hydrophobia.
    *   **Laboratory:**
        *   Antigen detection (Skin biopsy from nape of neck).
        *   **Negri Bodies:** Intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies in neurons (Hippocampus/Cerebellum). Seen in 75-90% of cases post-mortem.

### 4. Management: Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)

Management relies on three pillars: Wound Care, Vaccination, and Immunoglobulin.

#### Step 1: Local Wound Care (Immediate)
*   **Flush and Wash:** Wash wound with plenty of soap and running water for at least **15 minutes**. This removes physical viral load.
*   **Disinfect:** Apply Virucidal agents like Povidone-iodine, Alcohol, or Tincture.
*   **Suturing:** **Avoid** suturing. If necessary, loose sutures only *after* infiltrating [[Rabies Immunoglobulin]].
*   **Others:** Tetanus toxoid and Antibiotics if indicated.

#### Step 2: Categorization of Bite and Action Plan
*(Crucial for Exam)*

| Category | Type of Contact with Suspect Animal | Recommended Prophylaxis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Category I** | • Touching/feeding animals<br>• Licks on **intact** skin | • None (Wash exposed skin) |
| **Category II** | • Nibbling of uncovered skin<br>• Minor scratches/abrasions without bleeding | • Wound Management<br>• **Anti-Rabies Vaccine (ARV)** |
| **Category III** | • Single/Multiple transdermal bites/scratches<br>• Licks on **broken skin**<br>• Contamination of **mucous membranes** (Licks on mouth/eyes)<br>• All bites by **Wild Animals** (Jackal, Fox, Bat) | • Wound Management<br>• **Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG)**<br>• **Anti-Rabies Vaccine (ARV)** |

*   *Note: Observation of Dog/Cat for 10 days is valid. If animal is healthy after 10 days, PEP can be stopped (only for dogs/cats)*.

### 5. Vaccination Regimens

**[[Anti-Rabies Vaccines (ARV)]]** are cell-culture vaccines (Potency $\ge$ 2.5 IU/dose).

#### Intramuscular (IM) Regimen (Essen Regimen)
*   **Dose:** 0.5 ml or 1.0 ml (as per vial) into **Deltoid** (Never gluteal region).
*   **Schedule:** 5 Doses on Days **0, 3, 7, 14, 28**.
*   *Mnemonics:* **0**h **3** **7** **14** **28** (Phone number of safety).

#### Intradermal (ID) Regimen (Updated Thai Red Cross)
*   **Dose:** 0.1 ml per site.
*   **Sites:** 2 Sites (Deltoid).
*   **Schedule:** Days **0, 3, 7, 28** (2-2-2-0-2 Regimen).
*   *Note:* ID route saves vaccine volume and cost.

#### Re-exposure Prophylaxis (For previously vaccinated)
*   If a person has documented full PEP history:
*   **Treatment:** Only Wound care + **2 Doses of Vaccine** (Day 0 and 3).
*   **NO RIG** is required.

### 6. Passive Immunization: Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG)

Indicated for all **Category III** bites to neutralize virus at the wound site before it enters nerves.

*   **Human Rabies Immunoglobulin (HRIG):** Dose **20 IU/kg**.
*   **Equine Rabies Immunoglobulin (ERIG):** Dose **40 IU/kg** (Must test for sensitivity first).
*   **Administration:** Infiltrate **maximum possible amount** into and around the wound. Any remainder is given IM at a site distant from the vaccine site.
*   **Timing:** Give on Day 0. Do not give beyond Day 7 of starting first vaccine dose.

---

### 7. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)

*   **Indication:** Veterinarians, lab workers, animal handlers.
*   **Schedule:** 3 Doses (IM/ID) on Days **0, 7, 21 (or 28)**.
*   **Advantage:** If bitten later, they need only 2 booster doses (Day 0, 3) and **No RIG**.
