# COMPARTMENT SYNDROME

### Definition
[[Compartment syndrome]] is a condition characterized by an elevation of the [[interstitial pressure]] within a closed [[osseofascial compartment]] that results in microvascular compromise. This increased pressure reduces capillary perfusion to a level below what is required for tissue viability, potentially causing irreversible damage to the neural and muscular contents of the space.

### Etiology and Risk Factors
The causes can be broadly classified based on the mechanism increasing the pressure:

| Mechanism | Causes |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Decreased Compartment Size** | • Tight dressings or casts ([[Plaster of Paris]])<br>• Premature closure of fascial defects<br>• Localized external pressure (e.g., lying on a limb) |
| **Increased Compartment Content** | • **Fractures** (Most common cause): Especially [[tibial fractures]] (both open and closed) and [[supracondylar fracture of humerus]] in children.<br>• Hemorrhage/Hematoma<br>• Post-ischemic swelling (reperfusion injury)<br>• Burns (eschar)<br>• Intense exercise (Exertional compartment syndrome)<br>• Snake bites |

**Clinical Implication:** [[Compartment syndrome]] can occur in open fractures as well, despite the theoretical "decompression" provided by the open wound, because the fascia may remain intact in other compartments.

### Pathophysiology
The condition is driven by a vicious cycle of ischemia and edema.

1.  **Trauma/Insult:** Causes edema or bleeding within a compartment.
2.  **Pressure Rise:** Fluid accumulation increases [[intracompartmental pressure]] (ICP).
3.  **Venous Obstruction:** Low-pressure veins are compressed first, preventing drainage.
4.  **Increased Edema:** Venous congestion leads to further fluid extravasation (transudation).
5.  **Arterial Compromise:** Eventually, arterioles are compressed, or the arteriovenous gradient is abolished.
6.  **Ischemia:** Muscle and nerve necrosis ensues. [[Myoglobin]] is released (risk of [[renal failure]]).

### Clinical Features
Diagnosis is primarily **clinical**. A high index of suspicion is required, especially in unconscious or intubated patients.

#### The "6 Ps" of Compartment Syndrome
*(Note: These are classic signs, but do not wait for all to appear before acting)*

1.  **Pain:** The **earliest and most reliable sign**. It is typically:
    *   Out of proportion to the injury.
    *   Persistent and progressive.
    *   **Pain on Passive Stretch:** Stretching the muscles within the affected compartment elicits excruciating pain (e.g., passive extension of fingers causes pain in the volar forearm).
2.  **Paresthesia:** An early sign of nerve ischemia (e.g., numbness in the first web space of the foot in [[anterior compartment syndrome]] of the leg).
3.  **Pallor:** The limb may appear pale or dusky.
4.  **Paralysis:** A late sign indicating significant muscle/nerve damage.
5.  **Pulselessness:** A **very late** and ominous sign. The pressure required to compress major arteries is much higher than the pressure required to kill muscle. **Do not wait for pulselessness to diagnose.**
6.  **Puffiness:** The compartment feels tense, swollen, or "woody" hard.

**Specific Sites and Signs**
*   **Leg (Anterior Compartment):** Weakness of [[dorsiflexion]], sensory loss in the first web space (deep peroneal nerve).
*   **Forearm (Volar Compartment):** Fingers held in flexion; pain on passive extension. [[Flexor Digitorum Profundus]] and [[Flexor Pollicis Longus]] are affected first.

### Diagnosis and Investigations
1.  **Clinical Diagnosis:** This is the gold standard in alert patients.
2.  **Compartment Pressure Monitoring:** Indicated in comatose, intubated, or equivocal cases (e.g., polytrauma).
    *   **Method:** Using a handheld manometer (e.g., Stryker device) or needle manometer technique.
    *   **Normal Pressure:** 0–8 mmHg.
    *   **Critical Threshold:**
        *   Absolute pressure > 30 mmHg.
        *   **Delta Pressure ($\Delta$P):** Most reliable indicator.
        *   $\Delta$P = Diastolic Blood Pressure – Compartment Pressure.
        *   If $\Delta$P is **< 30 mmHg**, fasciotomy is indicated.

### Management
This is a medical and surgical emergency. "Time is Muscle."

#### Immediate Conservative Measures
1.  **Remove Constrictions:** Split all casts, bandages, and dressings down to the skin immediately. Spread the cast.
2.  **Limb Positioning:** Nurse the limb **flat** (at heart level).
    *   **Clinical Implication:** **DO NOT** elevate the limb. Elevation reduces local arterial perfusion pressure (head of pressure) and worsens ischemia in the presence of increased compartment pressure.
3.  **Supportive Care:** Analgesics, oxygen, and fluid resuscitation to maintain blood pressure.

#### Surgical Management: [[Fasciotomy]]
If symptoms do not improve within 30–60 minutes of conservative measures, or if pressures remain critical:
*   **Procedure:** Surgical decompression of the involved compartments by incising the fascia and skin.
*   **Leg:** Usually requires a two-incision technique (medial and lateral) to decompress all four compartments (Anterior, Lateral, Superficial Posterior, Deep Posterior).
*   **Forearm:** Volar and/or dorsal incisions to release the flexor and extensor compartments.
*   **Post-operative:** Wounds are left open. Delayed primary closure or [[skin grafting]] is performed once swelling subsides (usually after 48–72 hours).

### Complications

#### 1. [[Volkmann's Ischemic Contracture]] (VIC)
The sequela of untreated compartment syndrome, classically in the forearm following [[supracondylar fracture of humerus]].
*   **Pathology:** Necrotic muscle is replaced by fibrous scar tissue, which shortens and contracts.
*   **Clinical Picture:**
    *   Extension of the wrist causes flexion of the fingers (Volkmann's sign).
    *   Claw hand deformity.
    *   Sensory loss and trophic changes.
*   **Tsuge's Classification of VIC:**
    *   *Mild:* Affects only finger flexors.
    *   *Moderate:* Affects wrist and finger flexors.
    *   *Severe:* Affects extensors and flexors + neurological deficit.
*   **Treatment of VIC:**
    *   *Mild:* [[Turnbuckle splint]], physiotherapy.
    *   *Moderate:* Max Page muscle sliding operation (flexor origin release).
    *   *Severe:* Carpectomy, bone shortening, or tendon transfers.

#### 2. [[Crush Syndrome]]
*   Systemic manifestation of muscle necrosis (rhabdomyolysis).
*   Release of [[myoglobin]], potassium, and toxic metabolites into circulation.
*   Leads to **Acute Renal Failure** (myoglobinuria blocks renal tubules) and cardiac arrhythmias (hyperkalemia).
*   **Treatment:** Aggressive IV fluids and alkalinization of urine.

#### 3. Infection and Amputation
*   Dead muscle is a medium for infection. Severe necrosis may necessitate amputation.
