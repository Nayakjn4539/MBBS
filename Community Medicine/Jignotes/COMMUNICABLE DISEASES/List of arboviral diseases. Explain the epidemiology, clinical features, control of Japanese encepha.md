# [[COMMUNICABLE DISEASES]] > List of arboviral diseases. Explain the epidemiology, clinical features, control of Japanese encephalitis

# Arboviral Diseases

Arboviruses (Arthropod-borne viruses) are a group of viruses maintained in nature through biological transmission between susceptible vertebrate hosts by hematophagous (blood-feeding) arthropods. They multiply in the tissues of the arthropod vector.

### Classification of Common Arboviral Diseases in India

| Group | Virus Family | Disease | Vector |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Group A** | Alphaviruses | [[Chikungunya Fever]] | *Aedes aegypti / albopictus* |
| | | [[Sindbis]] | *Culex* |
| **Group B** | Flaviviruses | [[Japanese Encephalitis]] | *Culex tritaeniorhynchus* |
| | | [[Dengue Fever]] | *Aedes aegypti* |
| | | [[Yellow Fever]] (Exotic to India) | *Aedes aegypti* |
| | | [[Kyasanur Forest Disease]] (KFD) | *Haemaphysalis* (Tick) |
| | | [[West Nile Fever]] | *Culex* |
| **Others** | Bunyaviridae | [[Sandfly Fever]] | *Phlebotomus* (Sandfly) |
| | | [[Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever]] | *Hyalomma* (Tick) |,,,

# Japanese Encephalitis (JE)

[[Japanese Encephalitis]] is a zoonotic disease caused by a Group B arbovirus (Flavivirus) and transmitted by culicine mosquitoes. It is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia.

## 1. Epidemiology

*   **Agent:** JE Virus (Flavivirus, single-stranded RNA).
*   **Vector:**
    *   **Primary Vector:** *[[Culex tritaeniorhynchus]]*,.
    *   **Other Vectors:** *Culex vishnui*, *Culex gelidus*.
    *   **Habits:** These mosquitoes are **exophilic** (rest outdoors) and **zoophilic** (prefer animal blood),.
    *   **Breeding:** Irrigated rice fields (paddy fields), shallow ditches, and pools,.
*   **Hosts (The Life Cycle):**
    *   **Reservoir/Maintenance Hosts:** Ardeid birds (e.g., Pond herons, Cattle egrets),.
    *   **Amplifier Hosts:** [[Pigs]]. Pigs develop high viremia without symptoms and infect mosquitoes. They act as "amplifiers" of the virus,.
    *   **Incidental/Dead-end Hosts:** [[Man]]. Man is a dead-end host because viremia in humans is short and low; mosquitoes cannot get infected from a human patient,. Horses are also dead-end hosts but can suffer encephalitis.
*   **Transmission Cycle:** Pig $\rightarrow$ Mosquito $\rightarrow$ Pig (or Bird $\rightarrow$ Mosquito $\rightarrow$ Bird). Man gets infected accidentally by the bite of an infected mosquito.
*   **Distribution in India:** Endemic in 24 states. Major foci include Gorakhpur (UP), West Bengal, Assam, Bihar, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu,.
*   **Seasonality:** Correlates with the rainy season and rice cultivation (monsoon months),.
*   **Age:** Predominantly affects children below 15 years.

> **Mnemonic for JE Hosts:**
> **P**igs **A**mplify (Amplifier)
> **B**irds **M**aintain (Maintenance)
> **M**an **D**ies (Dead-end)

## 2. Clinical Features

*   **Incubation Period:** 5 to 15 days,.
*   **The Iceberg Phenomenon:** For every 1 clinical case, there are 300 to 1000 inapparent (subclinical) infections,.
*   **Clinical Course (3 Stages):**
    1.  **Prodromal Stage (1–6 days):** Acute onset of fever, headache, malaise, and gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting),.
    2.  **Acute Encephalitic Stage:** High fever ($38^{\circ}$–$41^{\circ}$C), [[nuchal rigidity]] (neck stiffness), focal CNS signs, convulsions, altered sensorium, and coma,.
        *   **Specific Signs:** Mask-like face, coarse tremors (extrapyramidal signs), dystonia, and abnormal limb movements.
    3.  **Late Stage/Sequelae:** Inflammation subsides, temperature normalizes. Neurological deficits may persist.
*   **Mortality:** Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is 20–40%,.
*   **Sequelae:** Residual neurological deficits (mental retardation, paralysis) occur in 30–50% of survivors.

**Clinical Relevance:**
In an endemic area, any child presenting with acute onset fever and altered sensorium/convulsions should be suspected for **Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES)**. JE is a major cause of AES in India.

## 3. Diagnosis
*   **IgM Capture [[ELISA]]:** Detects JE-specific IgM antibodies in CSF or blood within 7 days of onset (Standard test).
*   **PCR:** Genome detection is possible but virus isolation is rare from human blood due to low viremia.

## 4. Prevention and Control

There is no specific antiviral treatment; management is symptomatic and supportive. Control relies on:

### A. Vector Control
Since vectors are outdoor resters (exophilic), indoor residual sprays are **not** effective.
1.  **Aerial/Ground Fogging:** Ultra Low Volume (ULV) fogging with Malathion or Fenitrothion during outbreaks to kill adult mosquitoes.
2.  **Personal Protection:** Use of [[Insecticide Treated Bed Nets]] (ITBN), full-sleeve clothing, and repellents.
3.  **Larval Control:** Use of larvivorous fish (*Gambusia*, *Poecilia*) in paddy fields,. Water management (intermittent irrigation) in rice fields.

### B. Vaccination (The Most Effective Measure)
*   **Live Attenuated Vaccine ([[SA-14-14-2]]):**
    *   Currently used in India's National Immunization Schedule.
    *   **Type:** Cell culture-derived live attenuated.
    *   **Dose:** 0.5 ml, Subcutaneous.
    *   **Site:** Left upper arm (or anterolateral thigh),.
    *   **Schedule:** Two doses.
        *   1st Dose: At 9–12 months (with Measles-Rubella 1).
        *   2nd Dose: At 16–24 months (with DPT Booster).
*   **Killed Vaccine (Mouse-brain derived):** (Nakayama/Beijing strains) - largely phased out due to side effects and need for multiple doses,.

### C. Reservoir Control
*   **Pigs:** Keeping pigs away from human dwellings (segregation).
*   **Pig Vaccination:** Possible but difficult and expensive to maintain herd immunity.
*   **piggeries:** Should be kept 4–5 km away from villages.
