### Birth Preparedness and Complication Readiness (BPCR)

**Birth Preparedness and Complication Readiness (BPCR)** is a comprehensive strategy within the [[Reproductive and Child Health (RCH)]] programme aimed at promoting the timely use of skilled maternal and neonatal care to reduce [[Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)]] and [[Neonatal Mortality Rate]]. It prepares the mother, her family, and the community to handle the delivery safely and react promptly to emergencies.

#### **Key Components of Birth Preparedness**
Planning in advance eliminates delays during the critical period of labour. The pregnant woman and her family must make the following decisions/arrangements **before** the onset of labour:

1.  **Identification of Place of Delivery:** Deciding whether the delivery will be at a hospital, PHC, or home. Institutional delivery is strongly promoted.
2.  **Identification of Skilled Birth Attendant:** Ensuring a [[Skilled Birth Attendant (SBA)]] or doctor is available. If a home delivery is planned (though discouraged), a trained Dai must be identified.
3.  **Arrangement of Transport:** Identifying a vehicle or ambulance service (e.g., 102/108 services) for reaching the facility or for referrals.
4.  **Funds/Savings:** Saving money for incidental expenses, even if services are free, to avoid financial delays.
5.  **Identification of Blood Donor:** Identifying a potential blood donor in case of severe haemorrhage.
6.  **Decision Maker:** Identifying who will make the decision to seek care if the head of the family is absent.
7.  **Essential Items:** Keeping necessary items ready (clean clothes for mother and baby, soap, etc.).

#### **Complication Readiness (Knowledge of Danger Signs)**
The family and mother must be educated to recognize "Danger Signals" requiring immediate medical attention. This helps in early detection and prompt referral.

**Danger Signs during Pregnancy:**
*   Bleeding per vaginum (APH).
*   Severe headache with blurred vision (Signs of [[Pre-eclampsia]]).
*   Generalized swelling of the body/face.
*   Fever/Convulsions.
*   Reduced or absent fetal movements.

**Danger Signs during Labour:**
*   Prolonged labor (>12 hours).
*   Convulsions/Fits ([[Eclampsia]]).
*   Placenta not delivered within 30 minutes.
*   Excessive bleeding ([[Postpartum Hemorrhage]]).
*   Meconium-stained liquor.

**Danger Signs in Newborns:**
*   Inability to suckle/feed.
*   Hypothermia or Fever.
*   Respiratory distress/Fast breathing.

#### **Role of Community Health Workers**
*   **[[ASHA]] (Accredited Social Health Activist):** She plays a pivotal role in BPCR. She counsels women on birth preparedness, assists in developing a village health plan, and escorts pregnant women to health facilities.
*   **[[ANM]] (Auxiliary Nurse Midwife):** Responsible for early registration, identifying [[High Risk Pregnancy]], and counseling on complication readiness during ANC clinics.

#### **Clinical Relevance: The "Three Delays" Model**
BPCR directly addresses the "Three Delays" that contribute to maternal death:
1.  **Delay in deciding to seek care** (Addressed by educating the Decision Maker and knowing Danger Signs).
2.  **Delay in reaching the health facility** (Addressed by arranging Transport/Funds).
3.  **Delay in receiving adequate care** (Addressed by choosing an appropriate Facility/Skilled Attendant).

#### **Government Support Schemes**
To support BPCR, the Government of India has launched specific schemes:
*   **[[Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY)]]:** Provides cash assistance to eligible mothers for institutional delivery, reducing the financial barrier.
*   **[[Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK)]]:** Provides **free transport** (home to facility, referral, and drop back), free drugs, free diet, and free blood transfusion to eliminate out-of-pocket expenses.
