# Cholera

Cholera is an acute diarrheal disease caused by [[Vibrio cholerae]] (serogroups O1 and O139). It is a major public health problem in developing countries, typically indicating a lack of social development and poor sanitation.

### **1. Epidemiological Determinants**

#### **Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** *Vibrio cholerae*, a Gram-negative, comma-shaped, motile bacillus.
*   **Serogroups:** The disease is caused by O1 and O139 serogroups. The O1 serogroup has two biotypes: **Classical** and **El Tor**.
    *   **El Tor** is currently the most common cause of epidemics (more resistant to environmental factors),.
    *   **Serotypes:** Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima.
*   **Toxin:** Produces a powerful **exotoxin** (enterotoxin) responsible for massive diarrhea,.
*   **Resistance:** Killed by heat (56°C for 30 min), drying, and sunlight. Easily destroyed by coal tar disinfectants (Cresol) and bleaching powder. However, it can survive in **ice** for 4-6 weeks,.

#### **Host Factors**
*   **Natural Host:** Human beings are the only known reservoir,.
*   **Age/Sex:** Affects all ages and both sexes. In endemic areas, the attack rate is highest in children.
*   **Gastric Acidity:** Acts as a barrier; vibrio is destroyed at pH ≤ 5. Reduced acidity increases susceptibility.
*   **Blood Group:** Individuals with **Blood Group O** are most susceptible.
*   **Immunity:** Infection gives temporary immunity. Vaccination provides partial immunity for 3-6 months.

#### **Environmental Factors**
*   Associated with poor environmental sanitation, contaminated water, and food.
*   Transmission is readily possible in communities with uncontrolled water sources.

---

### **2. Mode of Transmission**
Transmission is primarily **Fecal-Oral**.
1.  **Fecally Contaminated Water:** Most important vehicle (uncontrolled water sources).
2.  **Contaminated Food/Drink:** Fruits/vegetables washed in contaminated water; milk, cooked food contaminated by handlers.
3.  **Direct Contact:** Person-to-person via contaminated fingers/fomites (secondary transmission).

---

### **3. Incubation Period**
*   Range: Few hours to 5 days.
*   Commonly: **1–2 days**,.

---

### **4. Pathogenesis**
*   Vibrio produces an enterotoxin in the small intestine.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **L-subunit:** Binds to gangliosides on the cell membrane.
    *   **H-subunit:** Activates **Adenyl Cyclase** $\rightarrow$ increases cAMP.
    *   **Result:** Massive outpouring of isotonic fluid into the intestinal lumen, leading to "Rice Water" diarrhea.

---

### **5. Clinical Picture**
A typical case presents in **three stages**,:

**I. Stage of Evacuation**
*   **Onset:** Abrupt.
*   **Diarrhea:** Profuse, painless, watery, effortless.
*   **Stool:** Characteristically **"Rice Water"** appearance (white flakes of mucus in water).
*   **Vomiting:** Follows diarrhea; often projectile.

**II. Stage of Collapse** (Due to rapid dehydration)
*   **Appearance:** Sunken eyes, hollow cheeks, scaphoid abdomen.
*   **Skin:** Loss of elasticity, cold and clammy.
*   **Hands:** [[Washerman’s hands]] (wrinkled skin).
*   **Vitals:** Pulse absent/thready, BP unrecordable, subnormal temperature.
*   **Other signs:** Intense thirst, muscular cramps (legs/abdomen), oliguria/anuria.

**III. Stage of Recovery**
*   Signs of improvement, BP rises, urine secretion re-established.

> **Clinical Relevance:** 90% of cases are mild/asymptomatic and indistinguishable from other acute diarrheas, but they play a significant role in maintaining the endemic reservoir.

---

### **6. Laboratory Diagnosis**
Diagnosis is never made with certainty on clinical grounds alone.

*   **Specimen:** Stool (collected via rubber catheter or rectal swab).
*   **Transport Media:**
    *   **VR Medium** (Venkataraman-Ramakrishnan).
    *   **Cary-Blair Medium** (Most widely used).
*   **Enrichment Media:** Alkaline Peptone Water (pH 8.6).
*   **Culture Media:**
    *   **TCBS** (Thiosulfate-Citrate-Bile salts-Sucrose) agar.
    *   Bile Salt Agar (BSA).
*   **Microscopy:** **Darting motility** (Shooting star motility) seen under dark-field illumination.

---

### **7. Treatment**
The primary goal is **Rehydration**.

#### **A. Rehydration Therapy**
*   **Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT):** For mild to moderate dehydration. Uses the principle that glucose enhances sodium absorption.
*   **WHO New Reduced Osmolarity ORS:**

| Component | Concentration (mmol/L) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Sodium | 75 |
| Chloride | 65 |
| Glucose | 75 |
| Potassium | 20 |
| Citrate | 10 |
| **Total Osmolarity** | **245** |

*   **Intravenous Fluids:** For severe dehydration/shock. **Ringer's Lactate** is the fluid of choice.

#### **B. Antibiotics (Adjuncts)**
Antibiotics reduce fluid loss and duration of vibrio excretion. They should be given *after* vomiting stops.

| Patient Group | Drug of Choice |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Adults** | **Doxycycline** (Single Dose) |
| **Children** | **Azithromycin** |
| **Pregnant Women** | **Azithromycin** |

### **8. Prevention and Control**

**A. Verification & Notification**
*   Confirm diagnosis (stool culture).
*   **Notification:** Locally and nationally. Under International Health Regulations, it must be notified to WHO within 24 hours.
*   **Declaration of Free Area:** Area is declared free of cholera when **twice the incubation period** (i.e., 10 days) has elapsed since the last case.

**B. Early Case Finding & Treatment**
*   Establishment of treatment centers (ORS depots).
*   Aggressive search for mild/moderate cases.

**C. Sanitation Measures**
*   **Water Control:** Chlorination is effective.
*   **Disinfection:** Stools/vomit should be disinfected with **Cresol** (5%) or **Bleaching powder**.
    *   Amount of bleaching powder for cholera stools: **50 gm/L**.

**D. Chemoprophylaxis**
*   **Mass chemoprophylaxis is NOT advised**.
*   Recommended *only* for household contacts.
*   Drug: **Tetracycline**,.

**E. Vaccination**
*   Parenteral vaccines have low efficacy and are not recommended for outbreak control.
*   **Oral Cholera Vaccines (OCV):**
    *   **Dukoral:** Killed whole cell + Recombinant B-subunit.
    *   **Shanchol / Euvichol:** Killed bivalent (O1 & O139). No buffer required.

### **Mnemonic**
To remember the clinical features of Cholera: **"RICE"**
*   **R** - **R**ice water stools
*   **I** - **I**ntense thirst
*   **C** - **C**old, clammy skin (Stage of collapse)
*   **E** - **E**yes sunken (Dehydration)
