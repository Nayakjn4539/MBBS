# [[PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IN OBSTETRICS, PAEDIATRICS AND GERIATRICS]] > FRUS will reduce MMR

### Role of First Referral Units (FRUs) in Reducing Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)

The establishment and operationalization of **First Referral Units (FRUs)** is a critical strategy under the [[Reproductive and Child Health (RCH)]] program and the [[National Rural Health Mission (NRHM)]] to lower the [[Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)]] and Infant Mortality Rate (IMR).

**Rationale:**
Obstetric complications are often unpredictable. While essential obstetric care can handle normal deliveries, **Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC)** provided at FRUs is vital for saving lives when complications arise.

#### 1. What is an FRU?
An FRU is not necessarily a specific level of facility but a function. It can be a [[Community Health Center (CHC)]], Sub-district Hospital, or District Hospital that has been upgraded to provide **Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (CEmONC)** round the clock.

#### 2. Critical Services at a Functional FRU
To effectively reduce MMR, a fully functional FRU must provide the following minimum services:

| Service Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **24-Hour Delivery Services** | Ability to conduct normal and assisted deliveries (forceps/vacuum) at any time. |
| **Emergency Obstetric Care** | Facilities for surgical interventions, specifically **[[Caesarean Section]]**, to manage obstructed labor and fetal distress. |
| **Newborn Care** | Essential care for the newborn and emergency care for sick children. |
| **Blood Storage** | Availability of a blood storage unit to manage **[[Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH)]]**, which is the leading cause of maternal death. |
| **Referral System** | Efficient referral transport to reach the facility (addressing the second delay) and prompt treatment upon arrival (addressing the third delay). |

#### 3. Strategies to Operationalize FRUs for MMR Reduction
Since specialist availability is a major constraint in rural India, the government has implemented specific strategies to make FRUs functional:

*   **Training MBBS Doctors:**
    *   **Life Saving Anaesthetic Skills (LSAS):** Training MBBS doctors to administer anesthesia for emergency obstetric procedures.
    *   **Obstetric Management Skills:** Training MBBS doctors in comprehensive obstetric care, including C-sections.
*   **Blood Storage Centers:** Setting up blood storage units at FRUs to ensure timely availability of blood during emergencies like hemorrhage.
*   **24-Hour Functional CHCs:** Upgrading PHCs and CHCs to provide round-the-clock delivery services.

#### 4. The "Three Es" Strategy to Reduce MMR
The FRU is the cornerstone of the "Third E" in the strategy to reduce maternal mortality:

1.  **E1:** **Essential Obstetric Care** for all women.
2.  **E2:** **Early Detection** of complications.
3.  **E3:** **Emergency Services** for those who need it (This is the primary function of the [[First Referral Unit]]).

#### Clinical Relevance
*   **Hemorrhage Management:** The majority of maternal deaths are due to PPH. An FRU reduces MMR by providing immediate surgical intervention and blood transfusion.
*   **Obstructed Labor:** Timely C-sections at FRUs prevent uterine rupture and maternal death.
*   **Sepsis:** Management of puerperal sepsis through higher-level antibiotics and care available at FRUs reduces mortality.

#### Mnemonic for FRU Criteria
**"C-Section BLOOD"**
*   **C** - **C**aesarean Section capabilities (Surgery)
*   **S** - **S**ick newborn care
*   **B** - **B**lood storage facility
*   **L** - **L**abor room functioning 24x7
*   **O** - **O**bstetric emergency management
*   **O** - **O**ther services (MTP, STI/RTI treatment)
*   **D** - **D**octors trained (MBBS trained in Anesthesia/Obs)
