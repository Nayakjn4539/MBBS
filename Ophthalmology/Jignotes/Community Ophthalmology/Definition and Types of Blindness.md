# Definition and Types of Blindness (WHO/NPCB)

## Current Definition of Blindness (WHO & NPCBVI)

Historically, there was a discrepancy between the World Health Organization (WHO) definition and the National Programme for Control of Blindness (NPCB) definition in India. However, in **2017**, India changed its definition under the [[NPCBVI]] (National Programme for Control of Blindness and Visual Impairment) to align with the WHO criteria.

**Blindness is defined as:**
*   **Visual Acuity:** Presenting distance visual acuity **less than 3/60** (Snellen) or inability to count fingers at a distance of **3 meters** in the better eye with the best possible correction.
    *   *OR*
*   **Visual Field:** Limitation of the field of vision to **less than 10 degrees** from the center of fixation.

> **Clinical Implication:** The shift from the older definition (<6/60) to the new definition (<3/60) drastically reduced the statistical burden of blindness in India (from approx. 12 million to 8 million), allowing for better international comparison and prioritizing severe cases.

### Clinical Blindness
*   Defined as **No Perception of Light (No PL)**.
*   This represents total loss of visual sensation.

## Categories of Visual Impairment (WHO/NPCBVI)

The WHO classifies visual impairment based on the **Presenting Distance Visual Acuity** in the **better eye**.

| Category | Diagnosis | Visual Acuity (Snellen) in Better Eye |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | **Normal Vision** | 6/6 to 6/18 |
| **1** | **Moderate Visual Impairment** | < 6/18 to 6/60 |
| **2** | **Severe Visual Impairment** | < 6/60 to 3/60 |
| **3** | **Blindness** | < 3/60 to 1/60 (or counts fingers at 1 meter) |
| **4** | **Blindness** | < 1/60 to Perception of Light (PL) |
| **5** | **Blindness** | No Perception of Light (NPL) |

**Note:**
*   [[Visual Impairment]] includes both Low Vision (Categories 1 & 2) and Blindness (Categories 3, 4, & 5).
*   Visual fields less than 10° constitute Category 3 (Blindness).
*   Visual fields between 10° and 20° constitute Category 2 (Severe VI).

## Functional Classification of Blindness

Apart from the statistical WHO categories, blindness is often classified based on the functional limitation it imposes on the individual.

### 1. Economic Blindness
*   **Definition:** Visual acuity less than **6/60** to **3/60** in the better eye.
*   **Implication:** The person cannot earn wages by works for which eyesight is essential (e.g., industrial work), though they can still navigate their environment.

### 2. Social Blindness
*   **Definition:** Visual acuity less than **3/60** to **1/60** in the better eye.
*   **Implication:** The individual is unable to recognize family members or friends at a distance and requires assistance for social interaction and navigation.

### 3. Manifest Blindness
*   **Definition:** Visual acuity less than **1/60** to just **Perception of Light (PL)**.
*   **Implication:** Severe restriction in mobility and daily activities.

### 4. Absolute Blindness
*   **Definition:** **No Perception of Light (No PL)**.
*   **Implication:** Total lack of visual sensation.

### 5. Legal Blindness
*   **Definition:** Used for legal and benefit purposes.
*   In India (NPCBVI/Recent Guidelines): Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) in the better eye of **less than 3/60**.
*   *Note:* Older texts may cite <6/60 or <1/60 depending on the specific statute referenced, but the <3/60 standard is the current alignment for legal definitions in many contexts.

## Concept of Avoidable Blindness

[[Avoidable Blindness]] constitutes approximately **80%** of global blindness. It is the sum of Preventable and Curable blindness.

### 1. Preventable Blindness
*   Loss of vision that could have been completely prevented by timely initiation of preventive measures.
*   **Examples:**
    *   [[Xerophthalmia]] (Vitamin A deficiency).
    *   [[Trachoma]] (SAFE strategy).
    *   Glaucoma (early detection prevents progression).

### 2. Curable Blindness
*   Loss of vision where sight can be restored by therapeutic or surgical intervention.
*   **Examples:**
    *   [[Cataract]] (Surgical extraction).
    *   Refractive Errors (Spectacles/Surgery).
    *   Corneal Opacity (Keratoplasty).

## Visual Disability Percentages (NPCBVI Guidelines)

For the purpose of issuing disability certificates and social benefits, visual disability is graded in percentages based on Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) or Visual Field.

| Category | Better Eye (BCVA) | Worse Eye (BCVA) | Disability % |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | 6/6 to 6/18 | 6/24 to 6/60 | 20% |
| **I (One eyed)** | 6/6 to 6/18 | < 3/60 to No PL | 30% |
| **II (Low Vision)** | 6/24 to 6/60 | < 6/60 to 3/60 | 40% |
| **III (Low Vision)** | 6/24 to 6/60 | < 3/60 to No PL | 50% |
| **IV (Blindness)** | < 6/60 to 3/60 | < 6/60 to 3/60 | 75% |
| **IV (Blindness)** | < 6/60 to 3/60 | < 3/60 to No PL | 80% |
| **V (Blindness)** | < 3/60 to No PL | < 3/60 to No PL | 100% |

*(Note: Visual field loss is also factored in: Field <10° is treated as 100% disability or Category V)*.
