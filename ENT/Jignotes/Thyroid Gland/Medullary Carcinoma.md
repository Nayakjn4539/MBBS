# Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (MTC)

[[Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma]] (MTC) is a distinct form of thyroid cancer arising from the parafollicular cells (C-cells) of the thyroid gland. Unlike differentiated thyroid cancers (Papillary and Follicular), MTC cells do not accumulate iodine and do not produce thyroglobulin.

## Etiology and Classification
MTC accounts for approximately 3–5% of all [[thyroid malignancies]]. It arises from the **parafollicular C-cells** derived from the neural crest (ultimobranchial bodies).

### 1. Sporadic MTC (75–80%)
*   **Age:** Typically presents in the 4th to 6th decade.
*   **Laterality:** Usually **unifocal**.
*   **Associations:** Not associated with other endocrinopathies.

### 2. Hereditary/Familial MTC (20–25%)
*   **Inheritance:** Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.
*   **Genetics:** Associated with germline mutations in the **[[RET proto-oncogene]]** on chromosome 10.
*   **Laterality:** Typically **multicentric** and **bilateral**.
*   **Subtypes:**
    *   **MEN 2A (Sipple Syndrome):** MTC, [[Pheochromocytoma]] (50%), [[Hyperparathyroidism]] (10–30%).
    *   **MEN 2B:** MTC, Pheochromocytoma, **Mucosal neuromas** (tongue, lips), **Marfanoid habitus**, Intestinal ganglioneuromas.
    *   **Familial MTC (FMTC):** MTC only, without other endocrine abnormalities.

> **Clinical Implication:** All patients with MTC should undergo genetic counseling and testing for RET mutations. If positive, family screening is mandatory.

## Pathology
### Gross Appearance
*   **Location:** Usually located in the mid-to-upper posterior portion of the thyroid lobes (where C-cells are concentrated).
*   **Appearance:** Solid, well-circumscribed but non-encapsulated tumor with a gray-white cut surface.

### Histopathology
*   **Cells:** Eosinophilic cells that vary in shape (round to spindle-shaped) arranged in solid sheets, nests, or trabeculae.
*   **Stroma:** Abundant vascular stroma with **[[Amyloid]]** deposition (procalcitonin aggregates).
*   **Immunohistochemistry:** Positive for **[[Calcitonin]]** and **[[Carcinoembryonic Antigen]] (CEA)**.

## Clinical Features
*   **Neck Mass:** Most common presentation; hard, painless thyroid nodule or mass.
*   **Lymphadenopathy:** Cervical [[lymph node metastasis]] is common early in the disease (50–75% at presentation).
*   **Local Invasion:** Advanced cases may cause pain, dysphagia, hoarseness (RLN involvement), and stridor.
*   **Systemic Symptoms (Paraneoplastic):**
    *   Rarely, MTC secretes excess substances causing specific symptoms (Carcinoid-like syndrome).
    *   **Diarrhea**, flushing, and asthma due to secretion of serotonin, prostaglandins, or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP).
*   **Distant Metastasis:** Can spread to lungs, liver, bones, and adrenal glands.

## Diagnostic Evaluation
### Laboratory Investigations
*   **Serum Calcitonin:** Highly sensitive and specific tumor marker for diagnosis, burden of disease, and follow-up.
    *   Both basal and pentagastrin-stimulated levels are measured.
*   **Serum CEA (Carcinoembryonic Antigen):** Prognostic marker; often elevated.
*   **Genetic Testing:** Screening for **[[RET proto-oncogene]]** mutation.
*   **Screening for Co-morbidities (MEN):**
    *   Serum Calcium and PTH (Hyperparathyroidism).
    *   24-hour urinary catecholamines/metanephrines (Pheochromocytoma).

### Imaging
*   **Ultrasound Neck:** To assess the thyroid nodule and cervical lymph nodes.
*   **[[Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology]] (FNAC):** May show amyloid; definitive diagnosis often requires immunostaining for calcitonin.
*   **CT/MRI:** To assess retrosternal extension or metastatic spread.
*   **X-ray Neck:** May show dense polymorphous calcification (amyloid).

## Management

### Pre-operative Preparation
**CRITICAL RULE:** In patients with MEN syndromes, **[[Pheochromocytoma]] must be ruled out and treated first** (via adrenalectomy) before thyroid surgery to prevent life-threatening hypertensive crisis during anesthesia.

### Surgical Management
Surgery is the only curative treatment as MTC is not sensitive to radioiodine or chemotherapy.

| Feature | Surgical Approach |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Tumor** | **[[Total Thyroidectomy]]** is the treatment of choice for all cases (sporadic and familial). |
| **Central Neck** | **Central Compartment Neck Dissection (Level VI)** is mandatory in all cases. |
| **Lateral Neck** | **Ipsilateral Lateral Neck Dissection (Levels II–V)** is often performed if the tumor is >2 cm or if central nodes are positive. Comprehensive dissection required if lateral nodes are palpable. |

**Note:** Unlike differentiated thyroid cancer, there is **NO role** for:
*   Radioactive Iodine (I-131) ablation (C-cells do not take up iodine).
*   TSH suppression with Thyroxine (C-cells do not have TSH receptors).

### Adjuvant Therapy
*   **[[External Beam Radiotherapy]] (EBRT):** Considered for extensive local invasion, residual disease, or extensive extracapsular nodal involvement.
*   **Systemic Therapy:** For metastatic disease, **Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors** (e.g., Vandetanib, Cabozantinib) targeting RET are used.
*   **Palliative:** 131I-MIBG may be used for metastasis in some cases.

### Prophylactic Surgery in Children
Children identified as gene carriers via screening should undergo prophylactic Total Thyroidectomy to prevent MTC development.
*   **MEN 2A:** Surgery by age **6 years**.
*   **MEN 2B:** Surgery within the **1st year** of life (more aggressive).

## Follow-up and Prognosis
### Monitoring
*   **Biochemical:** Serial measurement of serum **Calcitonin** and **CEA** levels.
    *   Persistent or rising levels indicate residual or recurrent disease.
*   **Imaging:** USG, CT, or PET scan for localization of recurrence.

### Prognosis
*   Overall 10-year survival is ~80%.
*   **Poor Prognostic Factors:**
    *   Older age (>45 years).
    *   Male gender.
    *   Incomplete surgical resection.
    *   MEN 2B phenotype (most aggressive).
    *   Extracapsular tumor spread.
