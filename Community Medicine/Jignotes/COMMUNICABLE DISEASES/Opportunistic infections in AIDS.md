# Opportunistic Infections in AIDS

**Opportunistic infections (OIs)** are infections caused by organisms (viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites) that are normally innocuous or commensal in a healthy human host but become pathogenic and life-threatening when the body’s immunological defenses—specifically [[CD4+ T lymphocytes]]—are compromised,.

### **Pathogenesis**
*   **Mechanism:** [[HIV]] selectively infects and destroys T-helper cells (CD4+ cells).
*   **Consequence:** As the CD4 count drops, cellular immunity declines, making the host vulnerable to specific infections at specific CD4 thresholds.
*   **Result:** Death in AIDS is usually due to uncontrolled or untreatable opportunistic infections.

### **Classification of Opportunistic Infections**

The OIs can be broadly classified based on the causative agent,:

| Category | Causative Agents | Common Clinical Manifestations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bacterial** | *[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]* | Pulmonary & Extrapulmonary TB (Most common OI in India). |
| | *Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)* | Disseminated infection, fever, weight loss. |
| | *Salmonella* | Recurrent septicaemia (non-typhoidal). |
| | *Streptococcus pneumoniae* | Recurrent bacterial pneumonia. |
| **Fungal** | *[[Candida albicans]]* | Oral thrush (Early sign), Esophageal candidiasis (AIDS defining). |
| | *[[Pneumocystis jirovecii]]* (formerly *carinii*) | **PCP pneumonia** (Most common OI worldwide). |
| | *Cryptococcus neoformans* | Cryptococcal meningitis (Extrapulmonary). |
| | *Penicillium marneffei* | Penicilliosis. |
| **Viral** | *[[Cytomegalovirus]] (CMV)* | Retinitis (Blindness), Colitis, Pneumonitis. |
| | *Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)* | Chronic mucocutaneous ulcers (>1 month), Bronchitis. |
| | *Varicella Zoster Virus* | Herpes Zoster (Shingles) - multidermatomal. |
| | *[[Human Papilloma Virus]] (HPV)* | Cervical cancer, Anal warts/cancer. |
| | *Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)* | Oral Hairy Leukoplakia. |
| **Parasitic/Protozoal** | *[[Toxoplasma gondii]]* | CNS Toxoplasmosis (Encephalitis). |
| | *Cryptosporidium* | Chronic watery diarrhea (>1 month). |
| | *Isospora belli* | Chronic isosporiasis. |
| | *Leishmania* | Visceral Leishmaniasis (Kala-azar). |

### **Correlation with CD4 Count**

The occurrence of specific OIs is strongly related to the level of immune suppression,.

*   **CD4 > 500 cells/µL:**
    *   Generally asymptomatic or mild symptoms.
    *   Persistent Generalized Lymphadenopathy (PGL).
*   **CD4 200 – 500 cells/µL:**
    *   [[Pulmonary Tuberculosis]] (Can occur at any CD4 count but risk increases as count drops).
    *   Herpes Zoster (Shingles).
    *   Oral Candidiasis (Thrush).
    *   Oral Hairy Leukoplakia.
    *   Kaposi's Sarcoma.
*   **CD4 < 200 cells/µL:**
    *   **Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia (PCP).**
    *   Esophageal Candidiasis.
    *   Chronic Cryptosporidiosis.
*   **CD4 < 100 cells/µL:**
    *   **[[Cytomegalovirus]] (CMV) Retinitis.**
    *   CNS Toxoplasmosis.
    *   Cryptococcal Meningitis.
    *   Disseminated MAC (Mycobacterium avium complex).
    *   CNS Lymphoma.

> **Mnemonic for OIs < 200 count:**
> **"P**neumonia **C**an **T**ear **H**ealth"
> *   **P** = **P**CP
> *   **C** = **C**ryptosporidiosis / **C**andidiasis (Esophageal)
> *   **T** = **T**oxoplasmosis
> *   **H** = **H**istoplasmosis

### **Major Opportunistic Infections: Clinical Highlights**

#### **1. Tuberculosis (TB)**
*   **Status:** It is the leading cause of HIV-associated mortality in India.
*   **Relation:** HIV activates dormant TB; HIV+ individuals are 30-50 times more likely to develop active TB.
*   **Presentation:** Often extrapulmonary or smear-negative in advanced HIV.
*   **Management:** Start **ATT (Anti-Tubercular Therapy)** first. Start **ART (Anti-Retroviral Therapy)** after 2 weeks to prevent **IRIS** (Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome).

#### **2. Pneumocystis Pneumonia (PCP)**
*   **Status:** Most common OI globally.
*   **Clinical:** Dyspnea, non-productive cough, fever.
*   **Prophylaxis:** [[Co-trimoxazole]] (Septran) is the gold standard for prophylaxis.

#### **3. Diarrheal Diseases**
*   **"Slim Disease":** In Africa, AIDS is often called "Slim disease" due to the wasting syndrome characterized by chronic diarrhea (>1 month) and severe weight loss (>10%),.
*   **Causes:** *Cryptosporidium*, *Isospora*, *Salmonella*, *CMV*.

#### **4. Neurological Manifestations**
*   **Toxoplasmosis:** Most common cause of focal brain lesions/mass effect in AIDS.
*   **Cryptococcal Meningitis:** Common fungal infection of CNS.
*   **AIDS Dementia Complex:** Caused directly by HIV virus crossing the blood-brain barrier.

### **Prophylaxis for Opportunistic Infections**

Preventing OIs is a critical component of HIV care (Care, Support, and Treatment).

| Prophylaxis For | Drug Regimen | Indication Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Pneumocystis jirovecii]] (PCP) & Toxoplasmosis** | **Co-trimoxazole** (Double Strength) | CD4 < 350 cells/mm³ or WHO Stage 3/4 disease. |
| **[[Tuberculosis]]** | **Isoniazid (IPT)** | For all HIV+ patients without active TB (to prevent reactivation). Dose: 300 mg daily for 6 months (or longer),. |
| **MAC (Mycobacterium avium complex)** | **Rifabutin** (or Azithromycin) | CD4 < 50 cells/µL (Advanced AIDS). |
| **Cryptococcal Meningitis** | **Fluconazole** | Secondary prophylaxis (maintenance) after initial treatment. |

### **Clinical Relevance**
*   **WHO Clinical Staging:** The presence of specific OIs determines the clinical stage of HIV (Stage 1 to 4). For example, Pulmonary TB is **Stage 3**, while Extrapulmonary TB is **Stage 4**,.
*   **[[IRIS]] (Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome):** When ART is started, the recovering immune system may mount an overwhelming inflammatory response against pre-existing opportunistic pathogens (like TB), causing a paradoxical worsening of symptoms.
