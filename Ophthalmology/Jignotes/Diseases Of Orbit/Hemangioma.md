# Orbital Hemangiomas

Hemangiomas are the most common benign vascular tumors of the [[orbit]]. They are broadly classified into two distinct clinical entities based on the age of onset, histological appearance, and clinical course: **Capillary Hemangioma** (seen in children) and **Cavernous Hemangioma** (seen in adults).

## 1. Capillary Hemangioma (Infantile Hemangioma)

It is the **most common primary orbital tumor** and periorbital tumor in childhood. It is essentially a hamartoma consisting of proliferating capillaries and endothelial cells.

### Epidemiology
*   **Age:** Present at birth or appears within the first month of life.
*   **Course:** It typically follows a biphasic course:
    1.  **Proliferative phase:** Rapid growth during the first year (6–12 months).
    2.  **Involutional phase:** Stabilization followed by slow spontaneous regression. Complete resolution often occurs by the age of 7 years.

### Clinical Features
*   **Cutaneous involvement:** Often associated with a superficial, bright red lesion on the eyelid known as **Strawberry Naevus**.
*   **[[Proptosis]]:**
    *   Appears as a periocular swelling in the anterior orbit.
    *   **Characteristic Sign:** The proptosis or swelling tends to **increase in size on straining or crying**,.
*   **Location:** Usually located in the superonasal quadrant of the orbit.
*   **Mechanical [[Ptosis]]:** Due to the mass effect on the upper eyelid.

### Complications
*   **[[Amblyopia]]:** This is the most serious complication, usually deprivation amblyopia (due to ptosis) or anisometropic amblyopia (due to induced astigmatism or globe distortion).
*   **[[Strabismus]]:** Due to mass effect or muscle infiltration.
*   **Exposure Keratopathy:** If proptosis is severe.
*   **Cosmetic blemish.**

### Management
**Observation** is the rule for most cases as spontaneous regression is common. Active intervention is indicated only if there is a threat to vision (optic nerve compression, exposure keratopathy) or risk of amblyopia.

**Treatment Modalities:**
1.  **Medical Therapy:**
    *   **Systemic Beta-Blockers ([[Propranolol]]):** Currently considered a very promising and effective first-line treatment. Dose: 2–3 mg/kg/day.
    *   **Corticosteroids:**
        *   **Intralesional injection:** [[Triamcinolone]] is effective for small/medium tumors.
        *   **Systemic steroids:** Oral prednisolone for large diffuse tumors.
2.  **Local Therapy:** Superficial radiotherapy (low dose) or Cryotherapy (rarely used now).
3.  **Surgery:** Rarely necessary; reserved for cases non-responsive to pharmacological modalities.

## 2. Cavernous Hemangioma

It is the **most common benign orbital tumor in adults**,. It is a well-encapsulated tumor consisting of large, endothelium-lined vascular spaces (cavernous spaces).

### Epidemiology
*   **Age:** 2nd to 4th decade (Middle age).
*   **Gender:** Strong female preponderance (70%).

### Clinical Features
*   **[[Proptosis]]:**
    *   **Unilateral** and **Axial** proptosis (as the tumor is commonly located within the **muscle cone**),.
    *   **Painless** and slowly progressive.
    *   It is **non-pulsatile** and **non-reducible**.
*   **Visual Disturbance:** Can occur due to hypermetropia (indentation of the posterior pole of the globe) or optic nerve compression.
*   **Fundus Findings:** [[Optic disc edema]] and chorioretinal folds may be seen.
*   **Gaze:** Generally does not cause significant restriction of ocular movements initially, unlike malignancies.

### Investigation
*   **[[CT Scan]] / [[MRI]]:**
    *   Appears as a well-defined, oval or rounded, intraconal mass.
    *   Usually distinct from the optic nerve and extraocular muscles.
    *   **Enhancement:** Shows contrast enhancement.

### Treatment
*   **Surgical Excision:** This is the treatment of choice.
*   **Approach:** usually via **Lateral [[Orbitotomy]]** as the tumor is retrobulbar.
*   **Prognosis:** Excellent, as the tumor is well-encapsulated and complete removal is generally possible.

## Comparative Overview: Capillary vs. Cavernous Hemangioma

| Feature | [[Capillary Hemangioma]] | [[Cavernous Hemangioma]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Age Group** | Infants / Children (1st year) | Adults (20–40 years) |
| **Onset** | Rapid growth then regression | Slow, progressive growth |
| **Gender** | Slight female predilection | Strong female predilection (70%) |
| **Pathology** | Hamartoma (Proliferating capillaries) | Benign Neoplasm (Large vascular spaces) |
| **Location** | Anterior orbit / Eyelid / Extraconal | Intraconal (Retrobulbar) |
| **Capsule** | Non-encapsulated (Infiltrative) | Well-encapsulated |
| **Clinical Sign** | Increases on crying; Strawberry nevus | Axial proptosis; Hypermetropic shift |
| **Treatment** | Observation / Propranolol / Steroids | Surgical Excision |

### **Clinical Implication: Intermittent Proptosis**
While hemangiomas are vascular, **intermittent proptosis** (proptosis that increases on bending forward or Valsalva maneuver) is **NOT** a typical feature of cavernous hemangioma. Intermittent proptosis is characteristic of **[[Orbital Varices]]** (congenital enlargement of venous channels),. Capillary hemangiomas in infants may show increased swelling on crying, which mimics intermittency.

### **Mnemonic for Capillary Hemangioma Treatment**
**"P S O"**
*   **P** - Propranolol (First line now)
*   **S** - Steroids (Intralesional/Systemic)
*   **O** - Observation (Wait for regression)
