# [[Upper Limb]] > Clavicle Fracture

# [[Clavicle Fracture]]

### **Introduction and Functional Anatomy**
The [[clavicle]] (Collar bone) is a unique bone in the human skeleton with several distinct features relevant to trauma:
*   **Shape:** It is S-shaped (convex forward medially, concave forward laterally).
*   **Position:** It is the only long bone that lies horizontally.
*   **Ossification:** It is the first bone to ossify in the body (5th week of intrauterine life) and ossifies in the membrane (membranous ossification).
*   **Function:** It acts as a strut connecting the [[axial skeleton]] to the [[appendicular skeleton]] (shoulder girdle), transmitting forces from the upper limb to the trunk.
*   **Weakest Point:** The junction of the middle and lateral thirds is the thinnest segment and the most common site of fracture.

### **Mechanism of Injury**
1.  **Indirect Injury (Most Common):** Fall on an outstretched hand ([[FOOSH]]) or a fall onto the shoulder. The force is transmitted up the arm to the shoulder and clavicle.
2.  **Direct Injury:** A direct blow to the clavicle (e.g., impact with a stick or in contact sports).
3.  **Birth Fracture:** It is the most common fracture in newborns during difficult delivery.

### **Classification**
The **Allman Classification** is the most widely used system, based on the anatomical location of the fracture.

| Group | Location | Incidence | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Group I** | **Middle Third** | **80% (Most Common)** | Usually displaced due to muscle forces. |
| **Group II** | **Lateral Third** | 15% | Can be unstable if [[coracoclavicular ligaments]] are ruptured (Neer's Classification applies here). |
| **Group III** | **Medial Third** | 5% | Rare; requires high-energy trauma. |

**Neer's Classification (For Lateral 1/3rd Fractures):**
*   **Type I:** Undisplaced (Ligaments intact).
*   **Type II:** Displaced (Coracoclavicular ligament ruptured/detached). *Unstable.*
*   **Type III:** Intra-articular extension into [[acromioclavicular joint]].

---

### **Clinical Features**
*   **Symptoms:** Pain, swelling, and inability to lift the arm on the affected side.
*   **Attitude of the Limb:** The patient typically supports the elbow of the injured side with the opposite hand to relieve the weight of the arm on the fractured clavicle. The head may be tilted toward the side of the fracture to relax the [[sternocleidomastoid muscle]].
*   **Signs:**
    *   Visible deformity or "step-off" (clavicle is subcutaneous).
    *   Tenderness and crepitus at the fracture site.
    *   Ecchymosis (bruising).

### **Displacement Deforming Forces**
In a standard mid-shaft fracture, the fragments displace in a characteristic pattern due to muscle pull.

| Fragment | Direction of Displacement | Deforming Force/Muscle |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Medial Fragment** | **Upward and Posteriorly** | Pulled by the [[sternocleidomastoid muscle]]. |
| **Lateral Fragment** | **Downward, Medial, and Anterior** | Pulled down by **gravity** (weight of the arm) and the **Pectoralis major** / **Latissimus dorsi**. |

*   **Result:** There is overriding of fragments and shortening of the clavicle.

### **Diagnosis**
*   **X-ray:** Anteroposterior (AP) view of the clavicle is usually sufficient.
    *   *Apical Lordotic View:* Occasionally needed to visualize the clavicle without rib overlap.
*   **CT Scan:** Rarely needed, except for medial end fractures or complex intra-articular fractures at the [[sternoclavicular joint]].

### **Management**

#### **1. Conservative Management (Treatment of Choice)**
Most clavicle fractures (especially middle third) unite well despite displacement or overriding.
*   **Indications:** Undisplaced fractures, most displaced mid-shaft fractures in the general population, fractures in children.
*   **Methods:**
    *   **Triangular Sling / Arm Pouch:** Supports the weight of the arm. Sufficient for most cases.
    *   **Figure-of-8 Bandage:** Attempts to retract the shoulders (brace back) to reduce shortening. Note: It is uncomfortable, requires frequent tightening, and has a higher rate of skin complications and nerve compression than a simple sling. It is less favored now.
    *   **Duration:** Immobilization for 3–4 weeks (until pain subsides), followed by mobilization.

**Clinical Implication:** In newborns with clavicle fractures, no active treatment is usually required. The fracture unites rapidly (1-2 weeks) with a lump (callus) that remodels over time.

#### **2. Operative Management**
Surgery is becoming more common for specific indications to allow earlier return to function and prevent non-union.

**Absolute Indications:**
*   **Open fracture.**
*   **Neurovascular injury** (e.g., [[subclavian vessels]] or [[brachial plexus]] irritation).
*   **Skin tenting:** Impending skin perforation by a sharp bone fragment.

**Relative Indications:**
*   **Floating Shoulder:** Ipsilateral fracture of the clavicle and [[scapular neck]] (unstable shoulder girdle).
*   **Widely displaced fractures** (>2cm shortening or 100% displacement).
*   **Non-union** (Symptomatic).
*   **Lateral 1/3rd fractures** (Neer Type II) which are unstable.
*   **Polytrauma:** To facilitate nursing and mobilization.
*   **Cosmesis:** (Patient choice, though a scar is traded for a lump).

**Surgical Techniques:**
*   **Plate fixation (ORIF):** Using anatomical locking plates or reconstruction plates.
*   **Intramedullary fixation:** Using Titanium Elastic Nails ([[TENS]]) or Knowles pins. Less invasive but pin migration is a risk.

### **Complications**

#### **Early Complications**
*   **Neurovascular Injury:** Rare. Damage to the [[subclavian artery]] or [[subclavian vein]]. Brachial plexus compression (usually ulnar nerve/medial cord).
*   **Pneumothorax:** Apical lung injury from a sharp bone spicule.
*   **Haemothorax.**

#### **Late Complications**
*   **Malunion:** (Most Common) The fracture unites with shortening or angulation. Usually functionally acceptable but leaves a palpable bony lump (cosmetic defect).
*   **Non-union:** Rare in the middle third, more common in the lateral third. Treated with plating and bone grafting.
*   **Shoulder Stiffness:** Due to prolonged immobilization.
*   **Post-traumatic Arthritis:** Acromioclavicular or Sternoclavicular joint arthritis.
*   **Thoracic Outlet Syndrome:** Excessive callus formation compressing the neurovascular bundle.
