# Malaria (Epidemiology)

### **Problem Statement**
Malaria is a protozoal disease caused by infection with parasites of the genus *Plasmodium* and transmitted to man by certain species of infected female [[Anopheles mosquito]]. It remains a major public health problem in India, characterized by fever with rigors and intermittent periodicity.

### **Epidemiological Determinants**

#### **1. Agent Factors**
*   **Agent:** Protozoa of genus *Plasmodium*.
*   **Species infecting humans:**
    1.  *P. vivax* (Most widespread; Benign Tertian).
    2.  *P. falciparum* (Most serious/fatal; Malignant Tertian; Neuro-malaria).
    3.  *P. malariae* (Quartan).
    4.  *P. ovale* (Rare in India).
    5.  *P. knowlesi* (Zoonotic, rare).
*   **Life Cycle:**
    *   **Definitive Host:** Female Anopheles Mosquito (Sexual cycle/[[Sporogony]]).
    *   **Intermediate Host:** Man (Asexual cycle/[[Schizogony]]).
*   **Infective forms:**
    *   Infective to Man: **Sporozoites**.
    *   Infective to Mosquito: **Gametocytes**.

> **Mnemonic for Life Cycle:** **"M&M"**
> **M**an is **I**ntermediate (Asexual).
> **M**osquito is **D**efinitive (Sexual).

#### **2. Host Factors**
*   **Age:** Affects all ages. Infants/children in endemic areas and non-immune adults are most susceptible.
*   **Pregnancy:** Increases risk of severe malaria, abortion, and low birth weight (LBW).
*   **Immunity:** Residents in high transmission areas develop **Premunition** (infection without overt disease).
*   **Genetic Traits (Natural Resistance):**
    *   **Sickle Cell Trait (HbS):** Protects against severe *P. falciparum*.
    *   **Duffy Negative Blood Group:** Resistant to *P. vivax* (as Duffy antigen is the receptor).
    *   **G6PD Deficiency:** Protects against severe malaria but complicates treatment with Primaquine.

#### **3. Environmental Factors**
*   **Season:** Transmission peaks during **July to November** (Monsoon and post-monsoon) in India.
*   **Temperature:** 20°C–30°C is optimum for the parasite.
*   **Humidity:** 60% relative humidity is necessary for the mosquito's life span.
*   **Rainfall:** Provides breeding grounds (puddles, collections).

#### **4. Vectors in India**
| Vector Species | Habitat/Region | Breeding Site |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Anopheles culicifacies]]** | Rural India (Main vector) | Rainwater pools, irrigation channels |
| **[[Anopheles stephensi]]** | Urban India | Overhead tanks, wells, cisterns |
| **[[Anopheles fluviatilis]]** | Hilly/Forest areas | Moving water (streams) |
| **[[Anopheles sundaicus]]** | Coastal areas | Brackish water |

### **Modes of Transmission**
1.  **Vector Transmission:** Bite of infective female Anopheles mosquito.
2.  **Direct Transmission ([[Trophozoite induced malaria]]):**
    *   Blood Transfusion.
    *   Congenital Malaria (Mother to fetus).
    *   Contaminated Needles (Drug addicts).
    *   **Clinical Relevance:** In Trophozoite induced malaria, there is **NO pre-erythrocytic (liver) stage**; hence, **NO Relapse** occurs. Radical cure is not needed.

---

### **Incubation Period**
The time from infective bite to onset of symptoms.
*   *P. falciparum:* 12 days (Range 9–14).
*   *P. vivax:* 14 days (Range 8–17).
*   *P. ovale:* 17 days.
*   *P. malariae:* 28 days.

> **Mnemonic for IP:**
> **F**alciparum is **F**astest (**12**).
> **V**ivax is **T**wo weeks (**14**).
> **M**alariae takes a **M**onth (**28**).

### **Clinical Features**
**Classic Malarial Paroxysm (Typical in Vivax/Ovale):**
1.  **Cold Stage:** Lassitude, headache, intense chilling and rigors (15 min – 1 hour).
2.  **Hot Stage:** High temperature (up to 41°C), hot dry skin, intense headache (2–6 hours).
3.  **Sweating Stage:** Profuse sweating, temperature drops, patient exhausted but relieved (2–4 hours).

**Periodicity of Fever:**
*   **Tertian (Every 48 hours):** *P. vivax, P. falciparum, P. ovale*.
*   **Quartan (Every 72 hours):** *P. malariae*.

**Complications (Severe Malaria - mostly *P. falciparum*):**
*   [[Cerebral Malaria]] (Coma).
*   Severe Anemia.
*   Renal Failure.
*   [[Blackwater Fever]] (Hemoglobinuria).
*   Hypoglycemia.
*   Algid Malaria (Shock).

### **Diagnosis**
1.  **Microscopy (Gold Standard):**
    *   **Thick Smear:** For **Detection** (High Sensitivity). Concentrates parasites.
    *   **Thin Smear:** For **Species Identification** (High Specificity).
    *   **Stain:** [[JSB stain]] (Jaswant Singh Bhattacharji) is the standard in India; Giemsa is also used.
2.  **Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs):**
    *   Detects antigens like **HRP-2** (specific for *P. falciparum*) and **pLDH** (Pan-specific).
    *   Used where microscopy is unavailable.

### **Treatment (National Framework for Malaria Elimination)**

**1. Uncomplicated P. vivax Malaria:**
*   **Chloroquine (CQ):** 25 mg/kg divided over 3 days.
*   **Primaquine (PQ):** 0.25 mg/kg daily for **14 days**.
    *   *Purpose:* **Radical Cure** (kills Hypnozoites in liver to prevent Relapse).
    *   *Contraindication:* Pregnancy, Infants, G6PD deficiency.

**2. Uncomplicated P. falciparum Malaria:**
Use **[[Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy]] (ACT)**.
*   **North-Eastern States:** Artemether + Lumefantrine (**ACT-AL**).
*   **Rest of India:** Artesunate + Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine (**ACT-SP**).
*   **Gammetocytocidal dose:** Single dose of **Primaquine (0.75 mg/kg)** on Day 2 to prevent transmission.

**3. Malaria in Pregnancy:**
*   **1st Trimester:** Quinine.
*   **2nd & 3rd Trimester:** ACT.
*   **Note:** **Never give Primaquine** to pregnant women.

### **Prevention and Vector Control**

#### **1. Anti-Larval Measures**
*   **Source Reduction:** Elimination of breeding places (filling ditches, covering tanks).
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Temephos (Abate):** Safe for potable water.
    *   **Paris Green:** Stomach poison for surface feeders (*Anopheles* larvae).
*   **Biological Control:** Larvivorous fish like **[[Gambusia]]** and **Poecilia** (Guppy).

#### **2. Anti-Adult Measures**
*   **Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS):** DDT, Malathion, or Synthetic Pyrethroids. Targets endophilic (indoor resting) mosquitoes.
*   **Space Sprays:** Pyrethrum extract (knock-down effect). Used for immediate control during epidemics/fogging.

#### **3. Personal Protection**
*   **[[Insecticide Treated Bed Nets]] (ITBN) / LLINs:** Long-lasting insecticidal nets treated with synthetic pyrethroids (Deltamethrin).
*   Repellents (DEET), screening of houses, wearing long sleeves.

#### **4. Chemoprophylaxis (For Travelers)**
*   **Short term (< 6 weeks):** Doxycycline (Start 1-2 days before, continue 4 weeks after).
*   **Long term (> 6 weeks):** Mefloquine (Start 2 weeks before, continue 4 weeks after).

### **Malaria Indicators (Metric Measures)**
1.  **[[Annual Parasite Incidence]] (API):** (Confirmed cases during one year / Population under surveillance) × 1000.
    *   *Significance:* Key indicator for operational efficiency and planning. Elimination goal is API < 1.
2.  **Annual Blood Examination Rate (ABER):** Target is >10% of the population.
3.  **Slide Positivity Rate (SPR):** % of slides positive.
4.  **Spleen Rate:** % of children (2-10 yrs) with enlarged spleen (Old indicator of endemicity).
