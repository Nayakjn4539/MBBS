# Congenital Anomalies of the Nose

Congenital anomalies of the nose result from errors in the embryonic development of the [[frontonasal process]] and the [[olfactory placodes]] during the early weeks of gestation (4th–8th week). These range from life-threatening airway obstructions to cosmetic deformities.

## I. Embryological Basis
The nose develops from the **frontonasal process**, which divides into medial and lateral nasal processes surrounding the olfactory pits.
*   **Frontonasal Process:** Forms the bridge, dorsum, and tip of the nose.
*   **Lateral Nasal Processes:** Form the alae of the nose.
*   **Medial Nasal Processes:** Fuse to form the columella, premaxilla, and philtrum.
*   **Bucconasal Membrane:** Initially separates the nasal cavity from the stomodeum (mouth); rupture of this membrane forms the primitive posterior nares (choanae).

**Clinical Implication:** Failure of fusion or canalization leads to specific anomalies like [[bifid nose]] or [[choanal atresia]].

## II. Choanal Atresia
This is the congenital failure of the posterior nasal cavity (choana) to communicate with the nasopharynx due to the persistence of the **nasobuccal membrane of Hochstetter**.

### Epidemiology and Types
*   **Incidence:** Approx 1 in 7000 births.
*   **Gender:** More common in females (2:1).
*   **Laterality:** Unilateral is more common than bilateral.
*   **Anatomic Composition:**
    *   Historically thought to be 90% bony.
    *   Recent evidence suggests **70% are mixed (bony-membranous)** and **30% are pure bony**.

### Clinical Presentation
*   **Bilateral Atresia (Neonatal Emergency):**
    *   Neonates are **obligate nasal breathers**.
    *   **Cyclical Cyanosis:** The infant turns blue while quiet/sleeping (mouth closed) and pink when crying (mouth open).
    *   Difficulty suckling and breathing simultaneously.
*   **Unilateral Atresia:**
    *   Often asymptomatic at birth.
    *   Presents later in childhood with unilateral, persistent, glue-like nasal discharge and nasal obstruction.

### Associated Syndromes
*   **[[CHARGE Syndrome]]** (Most common association):
    *   **C** - [[Coloboma]]
    *   **H** - [[Heart defects]]
    *   **A** - [[Atresia of Choanae]]
    *   **R** - [[Retarded growth]]
    *   **G** - [[Genital hypoplasia]]
    *   **E** - [[Ear anomalies]]

### Diagnosis
1.  **Clinical:** Failure to pass a size 6-8 Fr catheter through the nose into the pharynx.
2.  **Misting Test:** Absence of fog on a cold metal spatula placed under the nostril.
3.  **Methylene Blue Dye:** Drops in the nose do not appear in the pharynx.
4.  **Radiology:** **[[CT Scan]]** is the definitive investigation to assess the thickness and nature (bony vs. membranous) of the atretic plate.
5.  **Nasal Endoscopy:** Confirmatory visualization.

### Management
**Emergency Management (Bilateral):**
*   Secure airway: **McGovern Nipple** (a large-hole nipple secured in the mouth) or Guedel airway to maintain oral breathing.
*   Intubation or tracheostomy if oral airway fails.

**Definitive Surgical Repair:**
*   **Transnasal Endoscopic Repair:** Puncture and drilling of the atretic plate (currently preferred).
*   **Transpalatal Approach:** Better exposure but higher morbidity; used for complex cases.
*   **Post-op:** Stenting and Mitomycin-C application to prevent restenosis.

## III. Congenital Midline Nasal Masses
These result from faulty separation of the neuroectoderm from the surface ectoderm during the closure of the anterior neuropore (fonticulus nasofrontalis). The critical differential diagnosis involves three main entities: **Dermoid**, **Glioma**, and **Encephalocele**.

**Mnemonic: DEG** (Dermoid, Encephalocele, Glioma)

| Feature | [[Nasal Dermoid]] | [[Nasal Glioma]] | [[Encephalocele]] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Origin** | Ectodermal inclusion (trapped skin/adnexa) | Nipped off glial tissue (heterotopic brain tissue) | Herniation of brain/meninges through skull defect |
| **Connection** | May have a sinus tract to skull base | Intracranial connection usually obliterated (fibrous stalk) | **Direct fluid connection** to subarachnoid space |
| **Location** | Midline dorsum, pit with hair | Glabella, side of nose, or intranasal | Nasofrontal, nasoethmoidal, or intranasal |
| **Compressibility** | Firm, non-compressible | Firm, non-compressible | **Soft, compressible, pulsatile** |
| **Furstenberg Test** | Negative | Negative | **Positive** (Swellings enlarges on jugular compression/crying) |
| **Transillumination**| Negative | Negative | **Positive** |
| **Diagnostic Risk** | Infection | Mistaken for polyp | **Biopsy Contraindicated** (Risk of meningitis/CSF leak) |

### 1. Nasal Dermoid
*   **Clinical:** Midline pit or sinus on the nasal dorsum, often with a protruding hair. May present as a widened nasal bridge.
*   **Pathology:** Lined by squamous epithelium with adnexal structures (hair follicles, sebaceous glands).
*   **Imaging:** CT/MRI to rule out intracranial extension via the **[[foramen cecum]]**.
*   **Treatment:** Complete surgical excision. If intracranial extension exists, a combined neurosurgical-otolaryngological approach is required.

### 2. Nasal Glioma
*   **Clinical:** Firm, non-pulsatile mass. 60% extranasal (bridge/side of nose), 30% intranasal (polypoid mass), 10% combined.
*   **Pathology:** Dysplastic neurogenic tissue (astrocytes, connective tissue).
*   **Treatment:** Surgical excision.

### 3. Encephalocele / Meningoencephalocele
*   **Clinical:** Pulsatile, soft, bluish swelling. Expands with crying (Furstenberg sign).
*   **Sites:**
    *   *Sincipital (Visible):* Nasofrontal, nasoethmoidal, naso-orbital.
    *   *Basal (Hidden):* Transethmoidal, sphenoethmoidal (appears as a nasal polyp).
*   **Diagnosis:** CT/MRI. **Never biopsy a mass in a child without imaging**.
*   **Treatment:** Neurosurgical repair of the skull base defect.

**Clinical Implication:** Any infant with a nasal polyp should be considered to have an encephalocele until proven otherwise. Simple nasal polyps are extremely rare in infancy.

## IV. Other Congenital Anomalies

### 1. Congenital Occlusion of Anterior Nares
*   **Cause:** Failure of canalization of the epithelial plug between median and lateral nasal processes.
*   **Treatment:** Excision of the web or stenosis.

### 2. Bifid Nose (Median Cleft Nose)
*   **Cause:** Failure of fusion of the paired medial nasal processes.
*   **Appearance:** Vertical cleft in the midline of the nose (Dog nose appearance).
*   **Associations:** Hypertelorism, cranial anomalies (frontonasal dysplasia).

### 3. Proboscis Lateralis
*   A rare anomaly where a tube-like trunk appendage develops on the side of the midline, representing a rudimentary nasal structure.

### 4. Arhinia
*   Complete absence of the external nose and nasal cavities (very rare).

### 5. Congenital Syphilis (Nasal manifestations)
*   **Early:** "Snuffles" (persistent purulent rhinitis in first 3 months).
*   **Late:** Saddle nose deformity, septal perforation.
