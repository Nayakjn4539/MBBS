# [[Demography And Family Planning]] > Demographic Cycle and Trends in India

### **Demographic Cycle**

[[Demography]] is the scientific study of human population, focusing on changes in size, composition, and distribution. The history of world population suggests that nations pass through a sequence of five demographic stages, known as the **Demographic Cycle**,.

**Mnemonic for Stages:** **H**igh **E**arly **L**ate **L**ow **D**ecline (**HELL-D**)

| Stage | Name | Characteristics | Birth Rate (BR) & Death Rate (DR) | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I** | **High Stationary** | Population remains stationary. | **High BR + High DR** (cancel each other) | India (before 1920), |
| **II** | **Early Expanding** | Population grows rapidly. | **High BR + Declining DR** | Many African countries, South Asia, |
| **III** | **Late Expanding** | Population continues to grow but rate slows. | **Declining BR + Declining DR** (Births > Deaths) | **INDIA** (Current Stage), China, |
| **IV** | **Low Stationary** | Zero population growth (ZPG). | **Low BR + Low DR** (balance each other) | UK, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, |
| **V** | **Declining** | Population size decreases. | **Low BR + Low DR** (BR < DR) | Germany, Hungary, |

### **Key Demographic Concepts**

1.  **Demographic Gap:** The difference between the **Birth Rate** and the **Death Rate**.
    *   This gap is **narrow** in Stage I and IV.
    *   This gap is **wide** in Stage II and III, leading to population explosion,.
2.  **Demographic Dividend (Bonus):** A period when the dependency ratio declines because of a decline in fertility. The working-age population (15–64 years) grows faster than the dependent population, potentially boosting economic growth,.
3.  **Demographic Burden:** Increase in total dependency ratio, mostly caused by an increased old-age dependency ratio.
4.  **Year of Great Divide:** **1921**. Prior to this, India's population growth was fluctuating/slow. After 1921, the population has steadily increased,.

### **Demographic Trends in India**

India is currently in the **Third Stage (Late Expanding)** of the demographic cycle,.

#### **1. Population Size and Growth**
*   **Total Population:**
    *   **Census 2011:** 1,210 million.
    *   **2022 Estimate:** 1,412 million.
    *   India is the **second most populous** country in the world.
*   **Growth Rate:**
    *   **Annual Growth Rate:** 1.64% (Census 2011); estimated 1.3% in 2022.
    *   **Decadal Growth Rate:** 17.64% (2001–2011).
    *   **Doubling Time:** At current growth rates, the population is expected to double in approx. 30–35 years,.

#### **2. Vital Statistics (Mortality & Fertility)**
*   **Crude Birth Rate (CBR):** Declined from ~49.2 (1901) to **18.7** per 1000 population (SRS 2022),.
*   **Crude Death Rate (CDR):** Declined significantly from ~42.6 (1901) to **7.2** per 1000 population (SRS 2022),.
*   **Infant Mortality Rate (IMR):** 28 per 1000 live births (SRS 2020).
*   **Total Fertility Rate (TFR):** declined to **2.0** (2020).
    *   Replacement level TFR is **2.1** (Goal: NRR=1).

#### **3. Sex Ratio**
*   Defined as the number of females per 1000 males.
*   **Census 2011:** **940** (or 943) females per 1000 males,.
*   **Child Sex Ratio (0–6 years):** **914** females per 1000 males (Census 2011).
*   *Trend:* Generally adverse to women, though showing slight improvement from 1991 (927) to 2011.

#### **4. Dependency Ratio**
*   Total Dependency Ratio (2020 estimate): **48.7%**.
*   Every economically productive member supports roughly one dependent.

#### **5. Literacy Rate**
*   **Census 2011 Total:** **74.04%**,.
    *   Males: 82.14%
    *   Females: 65.46%.
*   Highest Literacy: Kerala (93.9%).
*   Lowest Literacy: Bihar (63.8%).

#### **6. Life Expectancy**
*   There has been a notable improvement.
*   **2020 Estimates:** Males **67 years**, Females **70 years**.

#### **7. Urbanization**
*   Urban population is continuously rising.
*   **Census 2011:** 31.16%.
*   **2020 Estimate:** ~34-35%,.

**Clinical Relevance:**
Understanding the [[Demographic Cycle]] helps in **Health Planning**. For instance, India's "Young Population" (approx. 26% below 15 years) requires focus on Reproductive and Child Health ([[RCH]]) services, while the increasing life expectancy necessitates planning for **Geriatric Care** and **Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)**.
