# [[Upper Limb]] > Galeazzi Fracture Dislocation

# Galeazzi Fracture Dislocation

### Introduction and Synonyms
[[Galeazzi fracture dislocation]] is a specific injury pattern involving the forearm. It is classically defined as a fracture of the **distal third of the [[radius]]** associated with **dislocation or subluxation of the [[distal radioulnar joint]] (DRUJ)**.

*   **Synonyms:**
    *   **Reverse Monteggia Fracture:** Because the pathology is opposite to Monteggia (Radius fractured, distal joint affected vs Ulna fractured, proximal joint affected).
    *   **Piedmont Fracture:** Often referred to by this name.
    *   **Fracture of Necessity:** Termed by Campbell (1941) because open reduction is almost always necessary for a satisfactory result in adults.

### Mechanism of Injury
The injury typically results from a **fall on an outstretched hand (FOOSH)** with the forearm in **hyperpronation**.
*   Direct trauma to the dorsolateral aspect of the wrist can also cause this injury.
*   **Deforming Forces:** Muscle attachments in the forearm (pronator quadratus, brachioradialis, and thumb extensors) exert rotational and shortening forces, making closed reduction difficult to maintain.

---

### Pathomechanics and Anatomy
*   **Bone:** Fracture of the [[radius]] usually occurs at the junction of the middle and distal thirds.
*   **Joint:** The [[distal radioulnar joint]] (DRUJ) is disrupted. This often involves injury to the [[Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex]] (TFCC).
*   **Displacement:** The distal radial fragment usually angulates dorsally, and the radius appears short relative to the ulna.

---

### Clinical Features
*   **Pain and Swelling:** Localized over the distal forearm and wrist.
*   **Deformity:** Angulation of the forearm may be visible.
*   **Prominence of Ulnar Head:** The head of the [[ulna]] may appear prominent dorsally (or occasionally volarly).
*   **[[Piano Key Sign]]:** This is a specific clinical sign for [[DRUJ instability]]. The prominent ulnar head can be depressed (like a piano key) but springs back up when pressure is released, indicating a tear of the distal radioulnar ligaments.
*   **Tenderness:** Over the fracture site and the DRUJ.

### Radiological Features
**X-rays** (AP and Lateral views) of the forearm including the **wrist** and **elbow** are mandatory.

| View | Findings |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Anteroposterior (AP)** | • Transverse or short oblique fracture of the [[distal radius]].<br>• Radius appears shortened relative to the ulna.<br>• Widening of the [[distal radioulnar joint]] space. |
| **Lateral** | • Radius is usually angulated dorsally.<br>• The **head of the [[ulna]]** is prominent dorsally (dislocated relative to the radius). |

**Note:** Always check the DRUJ in any distal radius fracture. Subluxation is suggested if the ulnar styloid is fractured at its base.

### Management
Because of the inherent instability caused by muscular deforming forces, this is a **"Fracture of Necessity,"** meaning surgery is required for adults.

#### 1. In Adults
*   **Treatment of Choice:** **[[Open Reduction and Internal Fixation]] (ORIF)**.
*   **Fixation of Radius:**
    *   The radius fracture is anatomically reduced and fixed using a rigid **plate and screws** (e.g., 3.5 mm [[LCDCP]] or [[LCP]]).
    *   Intramedullary nails are generally **not** used as they do not provide adequate rotational stability or anatomical restoration of the radial bow.
*   **Management of [[DRUJ]]:**
    *   Once the radius is fixed to length, the DRUJ usually reduces spontaneously.
    *   **Assess Stability:** The surgeon checks DRUJ stability intra-operatively.
        *   **Stable:** No further fixation needed. Mobilize early.
        *   **Unstable:** The joint may need stabilization with **[[K-wires]]** (transfixing ulna to radius) for 4–6 weeks or immobilization in a long-arm cast in **supination** (which reduces the DRUJ).

#### 2. In Children
*   Can often be managed conservatively with **Closed Reduction and Casting** if stable.
*   If unstable, percutaneous pinning or plating may be required.

### Complications
1.  **[[Malunion]]:** Common if treated conservatively. Results in limitation of supination/pronation.
2.  **[[Non-union]]:** Failure of the bone to heal.
3.  **[[DRUJ Instability]]:** Chronic pain, weakness, and clicking at the wrist.
4.  **Nerve Injury:**
    *   **[[Ulnar nerve]]** palsy can occur due to the dislocation of the ulnar head.
    *   **[[Anterior Interosseous Nerve]]** (AIN) injury may occur (rare compared to supracondylar fractures).
5.  **[[Compartment Syndrome]]:** Especially in high-energy trauma.
